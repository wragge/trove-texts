ENO S FRUIT SALT-
For generations the practice of taking
Eno’s “Fruit Salt” first thing every morn-
ing has been the golden rule of healthy
living among sensible people*
Eno helps your system, in Nature’s
own way, to free itself regularly of its
daily waste, and sees to it that your
blood-stream is always clean and
vigorous* Leads to a fuller enjoy-
ment of every minute of your daily life*
And Eno does its work so pleasantly*
The idea that only unpleasant purga-
tive mineral salts can be good for you
has long been exploded* In this climate
nothing can really take the place of
Eno with its beneficial effect upon the
whole system*

NATURE is a stern taskmistress if
you disregard her. The first
command is to keep a clean
open system so that disease cannot get
a foothold. Constipation is a deadly
menace. Reasonable exercise and the
help of Figsen at the slightest sign of
constipation will keep your system
working cleanly and well. Figsen, the
gentle laxative, is a splendid precau-
tion against eliminative troubles, does
not purge or gripe nor does it create
the “medicine habit.” No unpleasant
after effects. Equally effective for
adults and children. Pleasant to take
and absolutely effective.

The Red Page
Thake
Not long ago a Bulletin reviewer slated
a vile book by not only extravagantly over-
praising it, but by holding aloft as Great
Art its most trumpery passages. A flood
of indignant correspondence followed; and
the reviewer took an oath not to do that
sort of thing again, except in red ink.
Those letters were written by the Thakes
of Australia; the sort of people who can
“see nothing funny in ‘Punch,’ ” and to
whom all things on earth—including ele-
phants—are not what they used to be*
Thake, who steps between boards once
more in Mr. Thake Again, by “Beach-
comber” (Chapman and Hall; 7s. 6d. net),
is, in most ways, an average human chap,
and in one particular—his absolute im-
perviousness to humor—not altogether a
rarity. From the Roundabout Club, Lon-
don; from Cowes, where yachting consists
in playing bridge below, at anchor; from
Stotton, where he contests a by-election;
after parties where the great joke of the
evening has been to put a pancake on the
gramophone, or serve ink-and-milk cock-
tails, or start throwing trifle punctually at
midnight—Thake writes his obtuse letters
to “Beachcomber,” and the result is a bright
comer in the “Daily Express” and a more
effectual criticism of modern English life
—not only English—than all the solemn
professorial treatises and undergraduate
dunghill realism put together. Who, for
instance, will • continue to doubt (red ink
this, please!) that the English are musical
after Thake has declaimed in defence that
“every English butcher’s boy whistles at
his work,” and even the poor, who “can’t
afford big human orchestral effects, keep
canaries or linnets”?
Benbow and Co.
More letters, but of a rather different
sort, are gathered into Unpublished Letters
jrorn the Collection of John Wild, R. N.
Carew (Philip Allan; 6s. net). A few of
them have only a precious interest, but the
majority are of a kind that lives for the
same reason that Ginger Mick went to
the war. The letters are from Benbow
(writing from Jamaica after the Santa
Marta sea fight, which, though he had lost
a leg, he was continuing towards victory,
until the captains of his ships petitioned
him to run, and paid for it afterwards by
being either executed or cashiered); from
Christopher Wren, Pope, Sterne, Captaip
Cook, Byron and a string of others. Sterne
offers Dodsley “Tristram Shandy” (first
vol.) for £5O, and the offer is declined;
Cowley announces that he is writing for
gold, and, “sordid as the inspiration is, I
will own no other”; Shelley seeks to get
books advanced to him on the strength of
prospective inheritance from his father and
grandfather, and nobly mentions their
respective ages, 63 and 85. A gem is
Thomas Moore’s letter to Linley, Sheridan’s
brother-in-law and author of a number of
songs:—
I do not know that I have ever been more
flattered than I am by the anxiety which you
express for my opinion of your music, and humility
is such a rare virtue in this world that I am
afraid you will hardly believe me when I say that
I should, long ere this, have told you how much
your compositions have delighted me, could I have
persuaded myself that my praises were of any value
to y0u.... It was this consciousness I assure you,
that made me rest satisfied with enjoying the com-
positions. you sent me, without running the risk of
exposing my ignorance to y0u....
Two days before, Moore had written in
his journal:—
Received a letter from Linley, expressing great
impatience at not receiving my opinion of his music;
in other words, dying to be praised.
Hypocrisy? Perhaps. But I, for one, have
yet to meet the person who, asking for a
candid opinion, really wants one. Aus-
tralia’s Linleys are legion, and (Peace be
everlasting!) so are her Moores.
A Young Novelist.
In his introduction to The Misted Mirror,
by Henry Daniel-Rops (Seeker; Roy croft;
7s. 6d.), translator R. H. Mottram doubts
whether anyone of essentially English char-
acter could possibly take up the attitude
the leading figure, Blaise, is described as
adopting towards a parent, some colleagues,
several women, the occult and God. Had
he said typically English character, the
answer could have been an easy agreement.
But Blaise is not put forward as typically
French, since there are sundry young
Frenchmen in the yarn, who, despite even
the birds-of-a-feather truism, don’t resemble
him at all. On the other hand, there are
young Englishmen and young Australians
(city ones mostly)
who decidedly do.
Blaise, in fact, is
neither a, French
type nor a world
freak. He is just
a young man
suffering from a rush of nerves to the head;
is a living and pathetic figure whose like
could be found in almost any group of
undergraduates in the world. The setting,
the circumstances, are French enough;
which is another of the novel’s realities.
Blaise is a young introvert who seeks,
through women, through demoniacal spirit-
ualism, some such light as that which his
religious mentors have tried vainly to assure
him could be found in life. He is a futile
figure; which is not- to say that the novel
is futile. It is anything but that. Its author
was born in 1901, and this, his first novel,
is arresting both as an achievement and as
a promise.
The Passage
Except to mention that it is now avail-
able in book form, little need be said here
of Vance Palmer’s The Passage (Stanley
Paul; Angus and Robertson; 6s. 6d.). I
have lately seen it criticised on the ground
that it is not carefully written; and if an}'-
thing more evident of critical incompetence
than that can .be dug up I’ll swim the
Passage in the raw. I know few Australian
books more carefully or more beautifully
written. Indeed, careful and beautiful writ-
ing is so rare, even in good novels, that I
feel sometimes that it must almost be a
defect. But the importance of The Pas-
sage is that, like John Dailey’s recent
“Only the Morning,” it deals with a hither-
to neglected aspect of Australian life; and
again like John Dailey’s novel, it marks
such a. signal advance in its author. What
either of these novelists may yet do I
haven’t the foggiest; but the fact that they
are thus progressing makes Hope not
altogether an abstract absurdity.
A Coon King
Black Majesty, John W. Vandercook
(Harpers; Rdycroft), is mentioned here
because it is now available at 55., and be-
cause not much attention was paid by
Australian critics to the earlier, more ex-
pensive, edition. It is the biography of
negro King Henry of Haiti, upon whom
O’Neill obviously based his play “The
Emperor Jones.” In'the light of its reality
the Emperor becomes a stagey figure; his
tinpot palace, his Cockney underling, his
whole kingdom, mere theatrical tinsel. The
real Henry, like O’Neill’s patronising ver-
sion, finishes himself off with a specially-
moulded bullet; a golden one, instead of
a silver one; and not from craven, super-
stitious fear, but in kingly acknowledgment
of inevitable but not dishonorable defeat.
He ends himself only when, struck down
by paralysis, he sees gathering the clouds
of envy, jealousy, ambition, greed. From
mason’s apprentice, .stable boy, billiard-
marker, he had become king, had built the
great citadel which to-day, even from the
sea 20 miles away, looms in majestic sil-
houette, and he had ruled incomparably
better than Australia seems to have been.
On top of that, the .appearance, instant upon
his helplessness, of a legion of traitors
among the people to whom he had given a
freedom negroes had not known before nor
have known since, all but visibly creeping
forward to finish off what paralysis had
begun, is a situation supremely tragic, be-
side which the Emperor Jones cringing and
whimpering in the jungle is a mere figure
of personal conflict. A word for those
much-maligned blokes, or blokesses, general
readers. Invariably they get it in the
neck from the author-turned-critic, and
from the kind of critics who see merit only
in processions of gloom, or arty-tarty pre-
ciousness, or some other hothouse growth.
The general reader may not buy your
“lust and violence at twenty-five shillings,”
and he may buy your Garbage and Ethel
M. Sell in large numbers; but give him a
Black Majesty and he will not usually
let you down. Surely he deserves some
credit for that.

A Staggering Indictment
If true, the tale told in New Wars, New
Weapons, by Lt. Commander the Hon.
J. M. Kenworthy, R.N., M.P. (Elkin
Mathews; 3s. 6d. net), is a staggering
indictment of Imperial defence policy. The
writer contends that, just as the Crimean
War was initially fought according to the
principles which governed the Peninsula
War, the Boer War according to the tactics
which governed the Crimean War, and the
late “Great” War according to the rules
and regulations governing the Boer War, so
the next war is being prepared for on the

HARDY’S WINES OF TINTARA
CAPT. JOHN MACARTHUR was one of the earliest pioneers of the Colony of New South Wales*, and during the regime of Governor
Phillip established a small flock of merino sheep at Parramatta.
From this small beginning the production of wool has reached its present amazing proportions, and at the present time it is clearly
proved to be the strongest asset Australia possesses.
The establishment of Hardy's vineyards in 1853 places them among the earliest, and Champion Reserve Port is the quintessence of
quality resulting from these years of experience and maturity.

How Indians Live
. . . strange customs
you see in America
TRADITIONS older than recorded time
still rule the American Indian. He pro-
pitiates the Rain God by dancing to the
thumping of a tom-tom. He makes exquisite
jewelry of turquoise and silver, weaves fine
rugs, models graceful pottery, but keeps
every decoration superstitiously imperfect so
that the Evil Spirit will be powerless.
You can tour America’s strange Indian
country when you go to England. The
shortest, fastest route is across the United
States. A swift Matson liner takes you from
Sydney to San Francisco. Splendid railway
service gives you a choice of many routes
across the continent. The cost is moderate.

assumption that it will be a replica of the
“Great” War. Some £60,000,000 of the
taxpayer’s money is being spent on the
navy, £50,000,000 on the military land
forces and only 2'i per cent, of the total
on the air arm.
The smaller type of 6in.-gun cruiser, like the
Leander, costs £1,700,000. For the cost of this one
cruiser, 100 great flying boats capable of flying 500
miles in four or five hours without refuelling and
carrying a heavy weight of bombs, either charged
with explosives or poison gas, and three or four
deadly torpedoes, can be provided. And for the price
of the Rodney and Nelson, the two latest examples
of out-of-date super-dreadnoughts completed in 1927,
1000 very fine aeroplanes capable of a ceiling of
over 10)000 feet and a speed of 130 m.p.h. and
more, and able to carry bombs up to 4000 pounds
weight each, could be provided.
Yet even the Grand Fleet did not ven-
ture to poke its nose out of harbor without
a screen of submarines, destroyers and air-
craft during the last war. Kenworthy in-
sists that this was due to the political
influence of the Admiralty, the huge vested
interests of the shipbuilders, the innate
conservatism of the people, the servility
and helplessness of the Ministers concerned,
and, last but not least, the need of elderly
admirals for floating quarters whose sump-
tuousness is commensurate with their
dignity.
Summing up, Kenworthy concludes that
the only reason why Britain is not already
completely at the mercy of her neighbors
is that the military mandarins of other
countries are just as conservative; but this
may not always be so.
If some Power, or group of Powers, to-day, Bay,
Russia and Germany in combination, or France with
her satellites, were ruthlessly to scrap and supersede
their ground and naval forces by flying armies and
navies, such Power, or group of Powers, would be
irresistible unless and until possible adversaries fol-
lowed suit.
Such revolutions have occurred before
in history. The Tartars overwhelmed Asia
and Europe simply because their armies
were entirely mounted. The European
armies, with their infantry holding back the
cavalry, plodded to and fro while the Tartar
light horse encircled them and cut them
up in detail. The Greek phalanx and the
Roman legion were other notable examples.
To send great super-dreadnoughts and
armies cooped up in tanks to meet an
aerial army is like sending crossbowmen to
fight artillery or sailing ships to fight steam
vessels.
Of a possible Japanese invasion of Aus-
tralia Kenworthy remarks:—
Even if Japan could undertake such an old-fashioned
overseas expedition now, a battle fleet at Singapore
would not prevent it, for the distances are too great.
A battle-fleet at, Sydney might affect the situation;
but the money this would cost would be far better
expended on the newer weapons—the submarine, the
fast ocean-going destroyer with her torpedo-tubes,
and, above all, the creation of an efficient air force
in Australia.
Kenworthy’s book is one which Australian
experts might well wrangle over. Present
reviewer is not an expert, but he was
watching a sham fight on the outskirts of
Melbourne the other day, and he asked an
officer directing one of the contending units
on what principles the battle was being
waged. “On the Continental model, accord-
ing to instructions,” replied the officer. He
was a soldier with a . distinguished war
record.
M.G. S.
The Real Maoriland Flavor
Recently I had occasion to bewail the
fact that Maoriland poets, taken in the
lump, don’t draw their inspiration from their
own land. Now comes to hand a pamphlet
verse by Charles Oscar Palmer and his wife
entitled The Mystery * of the Moa (Whit-
combe and Tombs). It is an irregular and
rambling narrative, and it certainly isn’t
poetry, though the rhymes are correct
enough. It is the effort of an elderly dairy-
farming couple, who have lived sparingly
and worked hard all their lives; had nine
children; reared seven. Their verse em-
bodies a wealth of Maori lore; has a word
for many a god and beast and flower, and
utilises very effectively in places the liquid
music of the Maori tongue. There is noth-
ing illiterate about the production. It is a
sincere attempt to put into rhyme the
authors’ affection for the traditions of their
country. That it hasn’t treated them very
kindly makes the essay the more meri-
torious. The little work might with profit
be studied by the horde of clever, sophisti-
cated young Maoriland verse-makers who
have so many advantages the Palmers lack,
but who haven’t achieved a tithe of their
sincerity.
This isn’t a literary criticism. It is an
appreciation of an aim a.nd an ideal.
Now a word or two in reply to 0. N. Gil-
lespie (R.P. 4/2/’3l), a versifier whose work,
from a literary standpoint, compares favor-
ably with anything produced in the land of
my birth. He has imagination and skill, and
I’m sorry to have annoyed him. But he
doesn’t know much about his own country.
“She-oaks and rimus” was an unfortunate
choice of trees. She-oaks may grow in
Maoriland, but not one Maorilander in a
hundred knows them by that name. As to
the rimu, which produces the gentlest and
most easy-working of all timbers except the
kauri (I speak as a carpenter both of wood
and words), I can’t imagine anyone select-
ing it as a shade tree, and, vagabond or
not, sitting under it to scribble verse. In
any case,,why this prejudice against vaga-
bonds? I have, as a buyer of verse, met
many Maoriland writers. My impression—
of course this refers only to the males and
also excludes Mr. Gillespie—is that their
literary merit was in most cases in inverse
ratio to their respectability.
I know that Maoriland has been to a
large extent Anglicised, but it has a most
interesting native race and some unique
flora and fauna. There’s a distinction be-
tween being just a maker of verse and
being a Maoriland poet. Any Cockney can
write about the oak and the ash and the
weeping willow-tree—and girls. Finally, the
native flax does grow in valleys. Valleys,
swamps and flats are the places where, as
a nigger would say, they don’t grow any-
where else. As to the writing of bush verse
in dinner-jackets, that reminds me that
Henry Lawson always put on a full dress-
suit with a white weskit before sitting down
at his buhl writing cabinet.

A Satchel of Books
In Vulgarity in Literature (Chatto and
Windus; 2s. net) Aldous Huxley discusses
nature’s non-gentleman as he appears in
society. He then describes the same phe-
nomenon as he manifests himself in litera-
ture. Vulgarity in literature is simply in-
sincerity. A modern example is pacifist M.
Holland’s post-war novel, “Colas Breugnon,”
which is “loud with protestations of a posi-
tively Rabelaisian jollity. Malgre tout, a
pacifist can be a good fellow and enjoy his
bottle of Burgundy as w 7 ell as another man.
Reading it, he was reminded of those acutely-
distressing exhibitions of facetiousness and
waggish joviality by means of which certain
clergymen try so hard to discount their dog
collars.” Literary exhibitionism of the same
sort is not unknown in Australia.
The Voice of Mystic India, by Alice Eliza-
beth Dracott (Rider; 3/6 net), is full of
wonders, the least of which would turn
Baron Munchausen and Sir John Maunde-
ville green with envy. In India Mrs. Dracott
encountered yogis who sat on river banks
and stopped British steamers by psychic
power alone when they wanted a fresh supply
of vegetables; magicians who were able to
keep their bungalows surrounded by butter-
flies in districts where those insects were
conspicuous by their absence; fakirs who
never missed their trains because the engines
would not start without them; a Mr. Jacob
who kept the authorities supplied with what
was happening in France long before the
cables; hotel pillows which gave forth the
thoughts and dreams of previous users;
a flat in Bombay so cold that if anyone slept
in it he would be frozen to death even in
the middle of the hot season; and other
marvels. Nor is Mrs. Dracott behind her
Indian acquaintances in the production of
psychic phenomena. She foretold events,
diagnosed dis’eases at a distance and re-
ceived the thanks of William Stead for an
obituary she wrote for an Indian paper.
Her book is packed with matter for aston-
ishment, yet the resultant effect is one of
dulness. One ghost story is much like
another in the absence of substantiation,
and spirits who are actuated only by the
most trivial emotions and whose words and
actions reveal the mentality of morons can
be very boring company. The voice of
mystic India is the voice of adult infantility.
Pomp and Circumstance, by E. de Gra-
mont, ex-Duchess de Clermont-Tonnerre
(Cape ; price not stated). These brilliant
memoirs caused a sensation when they were
published recently in Paris, as well they
might. They paint an unforgettable picture
of the decayed aristocracy of France, stick-
ing to its carriages and chateaux in an age of
factories and Fords while it was slowly being
supplanted by the new aristocracy of wealth.
Madame’s second husband’s mother was a
Rothschild, so she had her feet in both
camps. The book is packed with vivid vig-
nettes : of the Duchess de Luynes, last of the
old regime, who tottered across Europe to
attend the christening of a Czarist infant,
and who, when she journeyed to ’Frisco,
wired to the Paris papers that “the Duchess
de Luynes has safely crossed the Rockies” ;
of Edmund Archdeacon, Irish deputy for Paris,
who used to finish up his election addresses
with tips for the races; of Robert Rothschild
at the age of 17 running upstairs shouting
to his brother, “I’ve got a mistress!” ;of the
beautiful adventurer Giovanni, “who was
appreciated by both sexes”; of the similar,
if not so cynical, upper society of England.
Madame is a ruthless realist and has no
illusions about the social paradox of which
she was a part.
Practical Jumping, by Major J. L. M.
Barrett (Country Life; 10s. 6d. net). The
writer has been Equitation Officer, R.M.C.,
Sandhurst, and knows his job thoroughly.
Like other contributors of such books to the
Country Life press, he is horse-lover first
and master afterwards. Primarily he is con-
cerned with hunting, but his book has lessons
for anyone schooling horses over the sticks.
And a Little Verse
LIFESAVER.
He was brought up out of the sea,
His' tali’body dead.
He was ca fried shoulder-high
Between the sea and sky.
The sun and the water trembled down
From his fingers and from the -brown
Valley between his shoulders, and the spray
Fell before him as he passed on his way.
His eyes were dead, and his lips
Closed on death, and his feet
Chained with death, and his hands
Cold with death. He is one with ships
And the bones of pirate bands
Steeped in salt , and knavery.
One with fish.,and fern and pearl
And the long lonely beat
Of the waves that ever curl
On the shell and weed and sand
Of the deep drowned land.
He was carried shoulder-high
Up the alleys of the sun,
And the heat
Washed him over from his head to His feet.
But you cannot give the body back breath
With a flagon full of sun.
He is drowned, the tall one.
Thin brother Death
Has him by the throat
On the sand, in the sun.

THE RIGHTS OF THE PEOPLE.
In the days when the Labor party was a
people’s party and believed that the majo-
rity should rule, great importance was
attached to the referendum, the initiative
and recall. Power to legislate for the refer-
endum was conferred on the Federal Parlia-
ment; but nothing was done anywhere to-
wards giving practical effect to the “initia-
tive and recall”—that is, the right of the
people, apart from the people’s representa-
tives, to initiate legislation, and the right
of the people to recall a member who was
no longer correctly representing them. The
party itself for many years protected the
people so far as it could by requiring every
one of its members to deposit a signed
letter of resignation; and it held fast to the
principle of three-year Parliaments so that
at the worst a non-representative member
could not long continue without having to '
face his masters. Outside a general elec-
tion there is still no power in our law to
remove a member for no longer correctly
representing his constituents. There is no
power either to compel him to get a fresh
warrant from his constituents.
Fortunately, however, there is a power to
send a whole Parliament to the country. In
the ordinary course this is done as a result
either of effluxion of time or of a Parlia-
mentary vote of no-confidence carried
against a Government. But there is a pro-
cess beyond that. More and moi'e the power
formerly in the sovereign and the sovereign’s
representative is passing to their advisers.
Their powers, nevertheless, are still very
large, and it is quite obvious that they have
been left very large for the express purpose
of enabling them to deal with any great
emergency. The most important of the func-
tions of the Governor-General are set out in
the Constitution itself. Thus (Section 5):
“The Governor-General may by procla-
mation or otherwise prorogue the Parliament
and may in like manner dissolve the House
of Representatives.” This same power has
been retained for the State Governor. He
may not do anything “in Council” without a
majority, though he may refuse to do things
of which he disapproves; not, however, be-
cause the things are distasteful to him as
matters of policy, but because he believes
them to be distasteful to the people. Always
is kept in the forefront this idea of the
sovereign or the Governor as guardian of
the people against a Ministry which he be-
lieves does not correctly represent them.
The sovereign or the Governor is, in short,
charged with the responsibility of doing in
a general way what the Labor party’s “re-
call” aimed at doing in particular cases.
This indeed is the outstanding argument
from the democratic standpoint in favor of
sovereigns and Governors. They are the
preservers of popular government against
the encroachments of Ministers who are
either suspected of corruption or have in
some way lost their balance.
The maintenance of this power is of
special importance in communities which
either possess only one legislative chamber :
or have a second chamber which is liable to
be swamped by a Government. As Queens-
land —an example of the one-chamber com-
munity—has shown, the power is not suffici-
ent, because by gerrymandering the electo-
rates a Ministry may load the dice in its
own favor. Nevertheless very real protec-
tion is given to the people by this power
reposed in Governors —always provided, of
course, that Governors have the courage or
the inclination to exercise it. If they have
not the courage or the inclination, it will
be very difficult to justify the retention of
the office in its present form.
An Australian Governor, besides being
the guardian of popular government, is
the guardian also of Imperial interests. So
important is it that these shall be guarded
that the Governor-General may return any
measure to the House in which it originated
with suggested amendments; and even if he
assents to a measure the King in Council
may disallow it within 12 months. Every
Governor, “within the range of what is law-
ful, must act according to the instructions
of the Secretary of State. He is called upon
to do so by the instruments which create
his office and appoint him Governor, and
he obeys the Secretary of State as the
mouthpiece of the Crown.”
The Governor of N. S. Wales and every
other Governor is thus called upon to con-
sider his Ministers in two aspects: (1) Are
they correctly interpreting the people’s will?
(2) Are they jeopardising Imperial inter-
ests? It does not seem that any misinter-
pretation of an ordinary character would
justify action. Nor, probably, would any
misinterpretation which had not been the
subject of objection by the Governor. And
how he is to satisfy himself that his Minis-
ters are out of step with the people does not
seem to be anywhere laid down. Objection
to Ministers on the ground that they are
jeopardising Imperial interests can be more
easily sustained. The opinion of the Secre-
tary of State would be final there.
Both Sir Isaac Isaacs and Sir Philip
Game will shortly have to consider whether
their Ministers should not be sent to the
people. The Federal Ministry is obviously
demoralised and is not speaking with one
voice; and how is it possible for such a
Council to satisfactorily advise the Governor-
General? Nevertheless action might reason-
ably be stayed in that case to see whether
an Emergency Ministry is not a possible de-
velopment. So far as the Government of
N. S. Wales is concerned, it may be that the
Secretary of State will instruct the Gov-
ernor that Mr. Lang’s proposals prejudice
Imperial interests; and that would justify
a dissolution and an appeal to the country.
British Ministers are, however, notoriously
disinclined to interfere if any other way out
of a difficulty of this sort can be found;
and in any case it would be far better for
action to result from such a popular pro-
test as would satisfy the Governor that
there is good ground to believe that the
Ministry is out of step with the people.
That there is an overwhelming body of
opinion against the Lang Government’s
handling of the situation seems certain; but
the Governor may reasonably require better
evidence than that. Absolutely conclusive
evidence may not be possible, nor should it
be required; but something better than local
and disconnected protests should be forth-
coming. A State-wide petition, asking the
Governor to exercise his undoubted right of
dissolving the House, should, if large
enough, raise such a doubt in his Excel-
lency’s mind as would entitle him to remit
the matter to the people for their decision.
It is regrettable that the country should be
put so soon to the expense of another gen-
eral election; but there is no other way
of rescuing the State from the chaos into
which it is already plunged.
MR. THEODORE’S “FIDUCIARY”
NOTE ISSUE.
When 27 people were marooned in the year
1776 on an otherwise uninhabited island in
the Pacific they found they could work
every day and as many hours a day as they
pleased, and that the longer and harder they
worked the more food and comforts they
had. In course of time, however, they were
not satisfied with the food and comforts
which their own islet provided. They
therefore sailed away bartering with other
islanders; and other islanders came to them.
Soon they realised among them the need for
a medium of exchange, and they agreed
upon a certain shell. Thus they lived in fair
contentment for many years, until some of
their number, returning from visits to
distant and more advanced countries,
wanted comforts and amusements faster
than their own exertions could supply
them. Others, so they heard, sold sons and
daughters into captivity to get these extras;
for themselves they evolved what they be-
lieved was a new system. They borrowed
from other countries great quantities of
money-shells, undertaking to return them,
along with certain other money-shells in
payment for the loan.
Presently, as population grew, things be-
came much more complicated on the island.
People no longer did all sorts of work: they
began to specialise, one man doing nothing
else but make boots, selling them to other
people, and buying all his other needs with
the proceeds. This system soon spread be-
yond the island itself. It was found that
the soil grew a bean which was in great
demand elsewhere; and many islanders
settled down to cultivate this bean and
nothing besides.
The plan which the islanders had adopted
for getting comforts and amusements be-
yond what their earnings would buy was a
great success-. They found, too, that they
could borrow many more shells than they
had thought possible. Nominally, to begin
with, the shell-money was borrowed to
make public improvements; but that was
soon quite a secondary matter. What
really concerned the islanders was that
the island got a vast amount more to spend
than it earned; and that was such an easy
way of living well without working hard
that the islanders employed it more and
more every year, hleantime, since they had
discovered a way by which they could get
all they wanted from other islands without
working as hard as they used to, they
gradually left off working hard, and even
nassed laws restricting their working hours.
Travellers who thought the people were
spending only what they earned went away
astonished, and said the islanders’ standard
of living was the highest in the world.
This made them very proud, and they were
sometimes mistaken for pouter pigeons.
About this time people from the islands
which had been lending this island all the
money began to grow a little anxious.
“Where are all our shells?” they asked.
“You told us you were using them to pro-
vide yourselves with permanent and repro-
ductive undertakings; yet we find that you
have been borrowing to pay our interest.
That doesn’t look as though you have been
putting the money into reproductive assets
at all. Let’s see your balance-sheet! When
the balance-sheet was at last produced it
was clear that the expenses were so heavy
that the undertakings were yielding no
profit whatever: most of them were not
earning working expenses let alone interest.
“Phew!” whistled the people who had lent
the shell-money. “This won’t do. Until
you can show us that these undertakings aie
earning interest and that we don t have to
lend you the money to pay ourselves our
own interest, we can’t let you have another
shell.”
Then, of course, there was trouble in the
island. Tens of thousands of borrowed
money-shells had been coming in every
year; now suddenly the inflow ceased, and
nobody could have more comfort or amuse-
ment than he could buy with his own cur-
rent earnings. There was a fierce commo-
tion about this. Well-fed gentlemen who
were paid to do it went up and down the
island telling the people that their standard
of living was the highest in the world and
that it mustn’t be lowered. One of those
disturbing elements who are always asking
how it’s to be done asked how this was to
be done: how could they buy as much with
what they could earn as they had bought
with what they could earn plus what they
could borrow? They talked about this for
18 months, and got no for’arder, mainly be-
cause of a discovery which had been made.
Some men with nothing else to do had found
out that if they got on a box and shouted
“Your standard of living must be main-
tained at all costs,” the mob applauded
them and sometimes even threw them shell-
money; so they got up on boxes and
shouted “Your standard of living must be
maintained at all costs” day and night.
This became one of the great industries of
the island.
But while this industry was thriving an-
other got into a bad way. Those beans,
which the island had been shipping away
and getting a great number of money-shells
for, fell into sudden disfavor. The island
could not get for three bushels of them as
many money-shells as it had been getting
for one bushel. There were other products
of the island which had exactly the same
experience. So one way and another the
supply of money-shells coming in fell away
prodigiously.
In the face of this some of the men who
occasionally got on the talking-boxes began
to have doubts. “If there are only half as
many shells coming in as there used to be,
and" if we have to send away twice as
many shells to pay interest, how,” they asked,
“is it possible for us to have as many shells
to spend? And if we haven’t as many
shells to spend, how can we have as good
a time?” There seemed to be some logic
in that; nevertheless, they said to one an-
other, “Look, if, after what we’ve told these
people, we go back now and admit that
we have been pulling their legs, and that
there are not enough shells to go
round on the old scale, they will stone us
to death.”
Meanwhile things were getting no better.
On the contrary, every time an orator
shouted “Your standard of living must be
maintained at all costs,” another islander
dropped out from the ranks of the workers
and joined the vast army of the wretched
unemployed. People who were regarded as
experts in these • matters were invited to
give advice as to how the position could
be improved. They seemed to see no diffi-
culties in the way at all. “It is all so
obvious,” they said. “If you haven’t the
shells, you can’t spend them. You must
live within your means, whatever those
means mav be.”
“No doubt you are right,” said some of
the gentlemen who had been on the talking-
boxes; “but, as we told you before, they’ll
stone us to death if we tell them that,
after the yarns we’ve been spinning to them
all along.”
At, this difficult stage an idea hit several
of them at about the same time. “The
trouble,” one of them said, “seems to be
that they want the same number of shells
when they are scarce as when they are
plentiful. Now, why should shells ever be
scarce? We have discovered how they can
be made. It is true that people outside our
island will spot the difference and won’t
take the counterfeits; but why not issue
them for local use?” “Yes,” said the silly
ass who will ask questions, “and how much
for’arder will that get us? We’re short of
shells not because we are not buying enough
goods from one another, but because, first,
we can’t borrow any more shells; second, we
can’t get as many shells for the beans and
things we sell to people outside; and, third,
we have to send so many shells away to pay
interest on all our old loans. How is the
making of a few counterfeit shells going to
help us —is it going to make us any richer?”
“Well, no,” said one of the most important
gentlemen of the talking-boxes, “well, no,
I suppose it isn’t. But it will make it
easier for us islanders to rob one another.
And, besides, it may save us fellows from
being stoned to death alongside our talking-
boxes.”
PLAIN ENGLISH.
Melba.
As a singer—possibly the most flawless
singer of all time—Dame Nellie Melba be-
longed to the whole world of music. She
conquered Brussels, Paris, Petrograd, Milan
and New York. Saint-Saens wrote an opera
for her; Puccini found in her the Mimi of
his dreams. In London she added to the
fame of Covent Garden, and was as much
an institution as the venerable theatre
itself. Kings, queens and emperors delighted
to do her honor. Her title as the Queen of
Song was undisputed for a far longer period
than that enjoyed by any of her predeces-
sors on the throne. Not quite so vivacious
and mercurial as Patti, not quite so silky
as Jenny Lind, she triumphed not only by
virtue of the marvellous voice with which
Nature had endowed her, but by her intelli-
gence, musicianship and strength of char-
acter.
To musical Australians she gave as much
pleasure and inspiration as to the rest of the
world; but beyond that Australians owe her
gratitude for that she associated her country
with her successes. She was always an Aus-
tralian, and a good Australian; and while
her generosity was everywhere known, it
was for her own country that she reserved
her richest benefactions. In the sense of
world-wide recognition, she was the greatest
of Australians.
Now that the glorious voice is stilled for
ever it is some consolation to remem-
ber that all that was Melba has not passed
with her body. Her memory will live in
the minds of the army of musicians she
helped and encouraged, and when human
memories end the tradition she established
will survive. The recording of her greatest
achievements by the gramophone will enable
the world to judge the great sopranos of the
future by the standard of a voice which in
the matter of purity of timbre and evenness
of register came as near perfection as
mortals can imagine. Australia, which has
already done more than its share in that
regard, will produce other great singers, and
they will be helped by the knowledge that
their most notable forerunner in the field
was not only Australian-born but indomit-
ably proud of her country.

Mr. Lang’s Interest Proposals.
There is no reason, of course, why a cir-
cular should not be sent to every holder
of Australian bonds making him a proposi-
tion that his interest should move with
the price-index figures of the Common-
wealth Statistician or some other high
authority. That would be a fair business
proposition. “Your bond,” we could fairly
put it, “was taken up when the index figure
was, say, 1600. It is now 1300. If you will
agree to reduce your interest by three-
sixteenths, and to further reduce it with
any further fall in the index figure, we wil
for our part agree to raise your interest rate
with every rise in the index figure. No-
body could object to that; nobody could
indeed object if along with such a proposi-
tion went a statement of Australia s present
position and an explanation of the fac
that the bondholder who agrees to his inter-
est moving with the index figure is the
only one who has an absolutely fixed
income. Had such an arrangement been m
force hitherto, holders of Australian Govern-
ment stocks would have been much bettei
off than they actually were. The interest
on stocks issued between 1900 and 1910(at,
say 3£ per cent, would have reached £7 m
1927. The £7 would not, of course, have
been worth one farthing more than the
£3 10s. was when the loan was issued; the
amount we actually paid was worth a shade
less than £1 15s. was in 1900-10.
No doubt quite an attractive proposition
could thus be put up to the stockholders,
whether in Australia or overseas. But it
would be a very different thing from the
plain robbery which Mr. Lang proposes.
For he does not suggest either that the
great financial interests” should be con-
sulted or that they should be given the
advantage of any future change in the price
situation in their favor. And it is not
merely the dishonesty of it which concerns
Australia so deeply: Mr. Lang’s scheme is
such shockingly bad business. What hope
would we have of renewing our loans in
London or New York if we told our credit-
ors that we had no regard for contracts,
and, having got their money, proposed to
pay for it what interest we pleaeed—or, h
it suited us better, none at all? On the
very suggestion of repudiation ot tni*
character the foreign market for our stocks
crashed until our 5 per cents, are worth from
£56 to £5B. Now, we owe 590 millions over-
seas. The average rate «f interest on our
total debt in 1928-29 was £4 18s. lid. P#
cent. On the basis of present quotations
it is reckoned worth about £7 os. 3d. pe
cent, to lend to Australia. The difference
between that and the average rate m
is £2 Is. 4d. per cent.; so that our extr.
interest bill even now, if weliadtorenev
our loans, would amount to £l2pBO,OW-
That is what uncertainty as to the future
costs; and that is why Mr. Langs proposal
is such shockingly bad business that one
should be surprised at it coming out oi
even a suburban house-agency.


Mr. Lang’s “Goods Standard.”
The gold standard of currency has its dis-
advantages, and these are particularly
apparent during a price-slump to countries
that export primary products. Attempts to
devise a more stable basis for the world’s
exchange transactions are being supported
and encouraged by leading bankers, eco-
nomists and monetary experts of many
nations; but the task to those who have
given it most study is a very compli-
cated and difficult one. It has been left to
Mr. Lang, of N. S. Wales, to solve all the
problems in no more time than it took him
to clip an extract from a newspaper.
In his great speech at Paddington Town
Hall on behalf of his candidate for
East Sydney, Mr. Lang was expected by his
followers to disclose the basis of his newly-
invented system of currency. The basis was
disclosed—an article in a small London pub-
lication, the “British-Australasian,” in which
a very old scheme was put forward as if it
were new. Mr. Lang said that to deal with
this subject fully he would have to devote
a whole night to it, but for once he under-
rated his powers of exposition. The plan is
ridiculously simple. “Primary producers of
non-perishable commodities” are to be
guaranteed a price by the Government for
all they produce. On turning their stuff into
Government stores they are to be paid in
notes which will form “an addition to the
currency.” If the world-price of these
commodities is below the Government-
guaranteed price, there will be no export
of them until prices outside rise, or “until,
in spite of the loss on exchange, they must
be exported to pay for purchases abroad ol’
to settle debts.” That is the whole box of
tricks. The dairy-farmers and the fruit-
growers are left out in the cold, and they
and the folk who make most of their living
by fattening stock for the export meat
market are not likely to reap anything
but loss, for they will have to bear the
brunt of a greatly-increased cost of labor
and of living. The “additions to the currency”
—which are really merely promises to pay
more than they are worth for the products
to which the plan is applicable—cannot but
increase the disparity between the value of
Australian money and the currency of the
rest of the world, and must thus increase
to an incalculable amount the burden of
overseas debt.
Currency reform involving any departure
from or modification of the gold standard
of exchange cannot be undertaken, save
for purely domestic purposes, by any one
nation. It cannot be undertaken, even for
purely domestic purposes, by the State of
N. S. Wales, which is bound by a clause in
the Federal Constitution vesting all matters
concerning currency in the Federal authority,
and by another which debars the State from
coining money or making anything but gold
and silver legal tender. Even at that, the
gold or the silver coin can only be used by
virtue of Federal authority.
But suppose, for the sake of argument,
that Mr. Lang overcomes the constitutional
difficulties, and that his plan is applied to
the whole of Australia. With a guarantee
of ss. a bushel for cereals, Is. 6d. per pound
for wool, 4s. a gallon for wine and 1929
prices for hides and skins, there would be
an addition to the note issue of about
£95,000,000 in the first year, a threefold
expansion of the present admittedly in-
flated issue. As there seems to be no pro-
vision in the scheme as quoted by Mr.
Lang for cancelling or redeeming these
vast additions to the currency, the way is
paved for progressive inflation on a scale
that makes Mr. Theodore’s more timid pro-
posals look positively pussy.

Another Death Dredge.
From E. J. Pearse, of Sydney:—
Re “Another Death Dredge” (B. 18/2/’3l). I
was on board this dredge from the day she left
Sydney until she reached Eden. She was surveyed
before she left by the Navigation Department, and
from my experience of 10 years as a marine engineer
I know the survey to have been most thorough.
Further, the escorting vessel had to take shelter
behind Montague Island while the dredge was quite
able to carry on. After some malcontents among
the crew had left at Eden, the dredge did not
“crawl back to Sydney”; she waited for a tug to
come for her, as this seemed to be a far more
expeditious method of getting to Tasmania. That
she had behaved well is shown by the fact that at
the time she was lost four of her original orew
were still ort board. Finally, before leaving Sydney
she was submitted to a scientific test which proved
her to have a metacentric height of over four feet
with her dredging gear in position, or about the
same degree of stability as a moderately large liner.
All of which goes to show that, no matter
what precautions are taken, these dredges
are not to be trusted on long ocean voyages.

A Reformed Crocodile.
Regulations granting preference to the
members of the notorious Waterside Work-
ers’ Federation were recently declared valid
by the High Court. No union has done more
to disrupt Australian industry and water-
borne trade than this federation; but in
the end its outrageous attitude lost it its
legal preference. For two and half years the
waterside has therefore known industrial
peace; for, though the members of the
federation received their measure of employ-
ment, the presence of many other capable
workers made another general hold-up of
the community impossible. Now the federa-
tion, with its black record, has a prospect
of being in the saddle again; and there is
no reason to hope that the bad old days
will not return if it can stick there.
The prospect is disturbing enough, and
it is darkened by one sinister aspect of the
new regulations. In the past it has always
been possible to save the situation by en-
gaging free labor to replace the strikers.
The new regulations will make that impos-
sible, since under them free labor cannot
offer without committing an offence against
the law. It is true that returned soldiers
who are not members of the federation will
be permitted to accept work without fear
of fine and imprisonment, but these men are
few and growing fewer, while those that
remain will find work alongside federation
members anything but a bed of roses, as
past experience has shown.
Much depends on the stand taken by the
Senate when the regulations come before
it for confirmation. It has the power to
cancel them, and in the interests of indus-
trial peace it should.

“Big Financial Interests.”
Who are these “big financial interests”
which, according to Mr. Lang, have entered
into a conspiracy to rob the worker and
ruin Australia—monsters who have no
thought but for the last drop of blood they
can suck out of the toiling masses? Let
us look at some of them.
Monster No. I —The most influential financial
institution in Australia is the Commonwealth Bank.
Among other things, it controls Australia’s currency.
It belongs to the people of Australia. There is not
a penny of private money invested in it; its capital
has been all made out of its profits; apart from
that, the savings of the people constitute its sole
funds. It is managed by men (including a Trades
Hall secretary) appointed by the people’s own Gov-
ernment.
Monster No. 2—The largest lender in Australia
is the A.M.P. Society; it has lent 43 millions to
Australasian Governments and 19 millions on mort-
gage, and has total balance-sheet figures of 78
millions. It has no shareholders; it is owned by
the holders of 448,437 policies in one department
and 581,841 in another. It elects its own directors.
Monster No. 3 —The largest of the Australian
private banks is the Bank of N. S. Wales. The
last available figures showed it had 6130 share-
holders; and many people were interested in some
of the holdings. Since that date the number of
shareholders has greatly increased.
Monster No. 4- —This is a composite monster, and
consists of the savings banks of Australia. Among
them they have the disposal of the enormous sum
of 225 millions. The total assets of all the joint
stock banks in Australia are only 355 millions, and
they owe 302 millions of that to depositors. Thus
these savings banks have more than two-thirds as
much money and credit at their disposal as all the
private trading banks put together. There is not
one shareholder in the lot; the concerns belong
to the people, and the funds are cut up among
4,937,428 deposits.
Monster No. s—This5 —This is a typical private bank,
chosen because it periodically sets out for the benefit
of its shareholders and the public a vast quantity
of statistical information not often procurable. In
1927 the National Bank of Australasia reported that
it had 7142 shareholders, with an average holding
of £560; and, of these, 2839 had an average holding
of £ll6 —surely the smallest monsters that a large,
beefy Premier evsr shuddered at. The depositors,
that division of the monster which dumps millions
on the counter and thereafter calls every quarter-
day for its great roll of interest sweated out of the
poor borrower—these depositors averaged £152
(current account) and £770 (fixed deposit), an
average of £279. Of the overdrafts 40.4 p.c. were
made to primary producers, for an average of £7BO ;
the balance were mercantile (24.7 p.c.), personal
and professional (28.3 p.c.) and a few sundries.
“Big financial interests” are a myth. Nine-
tenths of all the money we read about is
owned by men we meet every day looking
in the shop windows for a pair of cheap
socks, or by women who are turning over
the cabbages at the vegetable-stall with a
view to the day’s dinner. , V

Married-women Teachers.
“Temp”: “Dominie” (B. 18/2/’3l) has been
unfortunate with regard to the married-
women teachers he has met. I am one of
the tribe in the Victoria service, working
to give a sick husband a helping hand. In
the last four years my absences make a
grand total of three weeks, and all were
taken only when illness brought me to the
end of my tether. When my small children
became ill I paid a woman to stay with
them, or, when skilled attention was neces-
sary, sent them to a public hospital. But
over and over again I have had to teach
double classes when unmarried females were
absent through trivial illnesses. I have thus
had 120 children to teach for a whole fort-
night, in hot weather. At times, too, I have
been asked to be responsible for two other
subdivisions under teachers less capable
than myself, but drawing larger salaries, be-
cause they were not married.
So let us be fair! The iniquitous part of
the Victorian law is that it is absolutely
impossible for a married woman to become
a permanent teacher, no matter what her
qualifications or circumstances. To get
among the sheltered ones, she must either
be a widow or divorce her husband. If he
refuses to be naughty, she must give him the
grounds for a divorce.
MR. LANG AND HIS NEEDS.
“Of the debt which Mr. Lang proposes to repudiate £250,000,000 worth of Government and municipal securities are held
by the Commonwealth and State savings banks, the life assurance societies and the friendly societies. Small subscribers form
the great majority of the 833,000 persons who subscribed to Australia’s war loans.”
FRIAR SCULLIN: “You can’t rob them. They’re our own deserving poor.’’
ROBIN HOOD LANG: “They may he; hut for the purpose of my present operations they’re foreign bloodsuckers. So they
shall be robbed with the rest.”

serve carefully and to spend wisely, it is now. In most cases
incomes are lower, and in many outgoing is greater, and conse-
quently reduced margins must be provided for.

POLITICAL
POINTS
In Melbourne again for one more palaver
with the Scullidores, Jimmy Mitchell sighed
heavily and said be had been head of a
Government for 10 months, and for nearly
tw 7 0-fifths of the time he had been travelling
to sterile Premiers’ and Loan Council con-
ferences. “It will be terrible,” he added,
‘ if I have to go back to the West with no-
thing to show for another 4000-mile jour-
ney” ; but it is hard to see what other report
he can make. When the Premiers met Theo-
dore came to light with another inflation
scheme, “an issue of fiduciary < currency,
limited to £18,000,000” ; and, three Laborites
being for it and three Nationalists against,
Scullin declared it carried on his casting
vote, though the Senate will certainly flatten
it out. The Loan Council sadly announced
that Lang’s threat to bilk the public creditor
had made, the £6,000,000 loan for the wheat-
growers impossible. Then, prodded vigor-
ously by Moore, of Queensland, it declared,
in effect, that Slang had lied like a red-
shank about the overseas debt, and that
until he . stopped posing as New South’s
Welsher. it would not back his bills. Straight-
way Slang’s tail started to droop, though he
is still bellowing.
At the general election 36,688 effective
votes were polled in East Sydney, and the
Labor majority was 13,522. In 1928 it was
5657; in 1925, 2653. A turnover like that
in Parkes, where Labor-socialism was 8769
to the good at the general election and 8833
to the bad at the by-election, would put
the Nationalist in. A lot will depend on
Darlinghurst, in which, on October 12, 1929,
one-third of the East Sydney electors lived
and had their ham and beef. Unlike the
other five subdivisions, it is predominantly
THE UNUSUAL RECRUIT.
“Mr. Ward, the Labor candidate for East Sydney,
is an advocate of the Lang plan, and a strong
opponent of the Prime Minister.”
SERGEANT BEASLEY: “He should make a
useful soldier, sir, except that his sym-
pathies are with the enemy, and he
means to stab you in the back at the
earliest opportunity
female, and, unlike four of them (Glenmore
Nithsdale, Paddington and Surry Hills
North), it is predominantly Nationalist; but
thousands of Darlinghurst ladies must snap
their manicured fingers at the compulsory-
voting law. Another theory is that they
never stay long enough in the place to vote.
Naturally the wheatgrowers feel they have
been sold again. Promised 4s. a bushel by
fools, 6s. 6d. by idiots and 7s. 6d. by liars,
they have been left to face the tragic fact
that the actual price at sidings is Is. 7d. to
Is. 10d., according to States; and those in
N. S. Wales are receiving demands for un-
employment tax at 7|d. in the £ on their
1929-30 income so that relief workers may
get boom-time wages, the 44-hour week and
bread at cut-rates, to say nothing of the money
promised to the sheltered civil servants. If
the Scullidores survive the latest Caucus
Donnybrook, and if they can collect their
scattered wits, they should introduce im-
mediately, as a first step, a sales tax on
flour that will give the farmers another 9d.
a bushel at least. Nothing else will answer,
and there is no more time to be lost.
At Wagga on Saturday 10,000 Riverina
farmers said what thev thought of political
promisers and playboys and inflationists and
repudiationists; and demanded relief from
the orgy of taxation and expenditure on the
bloated Federal and State establishments.
There have been similar gatherings in other
States, and they are all strikingly reminis-
cent of the great camp-meetings of farmers
addressed by Lincoln when the U.S.A. was
drifting to a catastrophe—except that Aus-
tralia’s Lincoln, if it has one, has yet to
reveal himself, and there will be no civil war.
Secession from Slang has become a live ques-
tion in northern N. S. Wales and the
Riverina, but not secession from the Com-
monwealth.
When he touches on banking problems,
Willis, Lang’s Minister in the Leg. Council,
is the most amusing of them all. Talking
the other night in reply to Henry Braddon,
Willis said that, even on their
own statistics, bank directois
and shareholders were mean
dogs who risked every penny of
depositors’ money in advances,
but only 18 p.c. of their own.
The simple fact, of course, is
that share capital guarantees
the repayment of depositors’
money, so that the depositor
doesn’t risk a penny so long as
the shareholders have a copper
left.
The decision of some Austra-
lian banks to deduct exchange
from divs. payable in Maoriland
has caused another earthquake;
and “the Wales,” which has had
most to do with pushing ex-
change rates up, lias caught it
hottest, there being about 1500
Wales shareholders in the Shiv-
ery Isles. The Wales replied
that five learned counsel in Lon-
don and Australia are unani-
mous that the bank must pay
its dividends in Australian cur-
rency. Other banks say they
have been similarly advised.
Now the Dominion Stock Ex-
changes are suggesting an
amendment of the ML. Com-
panies Act making it obligatory
on any foreign co. making pro-
fits out o'f the country to pay
dividends free of exchange to
M.L. shareholders.
Melb. Trades Hall spouters, who had been
ordering State Labor Parliamentarians about
for weeks, found they were small spuds when
they called as a deputation to see the Parlia-
mentarians about unemployment. They were
kept cooling their feet on the lobby tiles for
20 minutes till the politicians were ready
to receive them. Then they were told that the
Act prescribing the pay for and conditions
of work financed out of unemployment taxes
would have' to be obeyed until repealed, even
if it conflicted with “Labor principles.”
The Queensland shearers’ strike was
started by Communists from N. S. Wales.
It has been broken by sheep-barbers from
N. S. Wales. The Communist gang is trying
to save its face by insisting that none of
its dupes shall work with men holding
A.W.U. tickets. The A.W.U. forbade its
members to strike, but, inflamed by the agi-
tators, many went back on the old union and
handed their A.W.U. tickets to the strike
committee, which burned them. These men
are now without jobs or the means of get-
ting them, though, to be sure, they have
plenty of time to listen to Red windbags from
Sydney who tell them everything will be all
right when the Revolution arrives.
The Australian C.T.U. (Council of Trades
Unions, not Christian Temperance Union)
sat in conference for a whole week, and
argued about 222 different propositions, and
rejected them all. It got nearest to a deci-
sion when it sent a deputation to Canberra
to suggest that a state of emergency should
be proclaimed. Canberra asked it to define
a state of emergency, and to mention the
Act under which the proclamation was to
issue, and to tell what would be do’ne with
the state when it was called into existence.
Nobody could. A proposal for a general
strike fell through. Great excitement was
created by a motion that the A.C.T.U. had
no confidence in itself, but it led to' nothing.
It stood out conspicuously that there are
too many union secretaries, all paid whether
there is a strike on or not, all talking at
once, and all wanting to be in Parliament,
but that fact—especially the general desire
to be in Parliament —was known before.
Official figures to the end of December
show how white the Australian joint-stock
banks have been bled. On Dec. 31, 1929,
they had £22,078,849 in gold. A year later
all but £2,901,739 had been taken from
them, and they were given Government paper
in return. Further, at the very moment
when the banks’ deposits were shrinking and
it was therefore tremendously difficult for
them to continue to finance private cus-
tomers, the Governments squeezed further
advances out of them — millions more in
the 12 months. And then the men who make
it impossible for the banks to help the com-
munity have the blazing impudence to incite
the community to throw bricks at the banks
for their failure.
When a Malay mother has a particularly
prepossessing infant she calls it “Si Hudoh”
(the ugly one), or “Si Bengkak” (the
hunchback). Hearing it thus called the
spirits of evil will pass the child by, as not
being worthy of their attention. Theodore
reverses the process. He calls his somewhat
ill-favored offspring “Inflation” by the high-
sounding title of “Fiduciary Issue,” in the
hope, no doubt, of warding off the attacks of
the Demon of Public Suspicion.

keepers, butchers, bakers and milkmen were
to share in the borrowed affluence dispensed
by Bill and Jim, and have their rents reduced
.by the Court. Instead, many of them can’t
even get their Government dole coupons
cashed without going to a moneylender. It
was suggested that they might pay their
income taxes with dole coupons, but this the
Commonwealth Constitution forbids :
115. A State shall not coin money, nor make
anything but gold and silver coin a legal tender in
payment of debts.
The same, clause makes nonsense of Slang’s
proposal that “the currency should be
altered” —in N. S. Wales and by his Gov-
ernment—“to one more suitable to the times
in which we live,” though the three lawyers
in his Cabinet let him rave.
Nothing is being done, or is likely to be
done, by the Slang Government for the
thousands of young city men who have lost
their jobs in offices and warehouses, or been
crowded out of the professions. Many of
them are keen on joining the growing army
of goldseekers, and their friends would be
only too glad to help with part of what they
pay in unemployment tax—a thing which
should certainly be allowed, to the extent
of at least 50 per cent of the tax. The All
for Australia League, which is making great
headway in Sydney and suburbs, might use-
fully take up the case of these young fellows.
“Backbone will see us through!”' said
Mr. Scullin, interviewed in London after

Despite pretences that they were keen on an
early session, Vic. State members were pal-
pably relieved when they saw the proclama-
tion extending the recess till April 21. The
Uppish House elections will take place about
May 30, and the session won’t begin until
June 10 —unless there is strong pressure for
more unemployment-relief money. Perhaps
if revenue from other sources improves the
Hogans will take the risk of making advances
for sustenance pending the enactment of
more taxes. The special income tax and
stamp duty for doles and some sort of work
have come to stay, for a few years at least.
The Moore Government promised to re-
store the Leg. Council abolished by Theo-
dore and co. Asked when he proposed to
do it. the Premier said his promise was con-
tingent on the taking of a referendum. But
a referendum has been taken. There was
one in Labor’s time on the question of retain-
ing or abolishing the Council, and the vote was
overwhelmingly for retention. That Theo-
dore chose to ignore the people’s verdict is
no reason why Moore should.
What rank rubbish is this platform stock-
in-trade of the Langs and Beasleys about
the banks sticking up the Governments with
“ultimatums” ! Every trading company has
a perfect right to state the terms on which
it is prepared to do business with customers,
Governments included. Suppose the repre-
sentative of a corporation went into Lang’s
office at Auburn and offered 30s. a week
for a house listed at £2 10s., adding that
he would regard a refusal of the offer as
a scandalous attempt to keep up the cost
of living. What sort of answer would he
be likely to get?
After conferences with trades-union officials,
who are almost as numerous as flies these
days, the N.S.W. Government has decided
that Piddington shall be sole judge of the
State Industrial Court, without appeal. So
the new Arbitration Bill is to make Pidding-
ton a law unto himself in the fixing of
wages and the like; if the bill goes through
he will, in those matters, be an old man
with a blank cheque signed by Lang. An
English paper recently described Lang as the
mad dog of Australian politics, though why
a dog should be dragged into the argument
it is hard to say. The average dog is an
animal with a well-balanced mind.
Mr. Beasley went to Geneva in 1926, and
repaid the Australian taxpayers, who footed
his bills, by being boorishly offensive to Italy.
Now we get this:—
Mr. Beasley said he visited the Krupp works in
Germany in 1926, and one of the directors told him
that if Germany had thought America would enter
the war she would have ordered munitions from her
to keep her quiet, even if the munitions had never
reached Germany. America only wanted the dollars.
And Mr. Beasley believed him, of course. Mr.
Beasley would believe anything to the detri-
ment of any of the Allied or Associated
Powers —always excepting Russia after the
quitters had their way—although the
Krupp person’s avowal, so carefully pre-
served, is a vile insult to the memory of
President Wilson and the Doughboys who
died at Chateau-Thierry and St. Mihiel, and
beside our own ladfl on the Hindenburg line.
It is Mr. Beasley’s leader who “only wants
the dollars” —though he would take English
pounds if they were available—and what
galls Mr. Beasley is that he can’t get them.
The law protected a repudiationist in
Victoria the other day. He had received
herbs to the alleged value of £34 from a
Chinese, and no person may recover any
charge for any medicine which he has pre-
scribed and supplied unless he is registered
as a chemist or doctor. In the realms of
finance it is the political herbalist who gets
the law’s protection.
HIS MASTER’S VOICES.
“By administrative act,” Lang roared at
Paddington, “we can* withhold-our. overseas
payments and scale down the interest
charges.” Any scaler can scale, if it comes
to that, and he may bolt from the crowd and
the police; but a State can't bolt, nor is
N. S. Wales beyond the reach of defrauded
creditors, as Russia was when it went in for
common swindling, or the American group of
States mentioned in “Martin Chuzzlewit.
N. S. Wales is part of the British Empire and
can be sued in its courts. It is part of the
Australian Commonwealth, and is under the
strictest obligation “to indemnify the Com-
monwealth in respect of the debts taken
over” by virtue of amendments voted into
the Constitution and of validating laws
passed by the Commonwealth Parliament and
its own. So wilful default is a serious
matter, a threat indeed to the very existence
of the national authority; and a Common-
wealth placed in that position has great
powers. It may pass a law declaring wilful
default an offence punishable with imprison-
ment, may then proceed against the
defaulters by indictment before a jury and
a Judge of the High Court, and may,
conviction, incarcerate them in a Federal
gaol. There is no Federal gaol at present,
but Duntroon and the Jervis Bay IN aval
College are invitingly empty.

“Sol Malaprop” : Einstein, who carries con-
densed Space and bottled Time around in his
pockets, has pursued his subjects a bit
further. He decides that if a ghost or an
idea or an elementary spirit or anything
takes a bee-line through eternity it won’t go
on for ever and get nowhere, as is commonly
imagined. Instead it will come back to
its starting point, for eternity isn’t eternal
m one eternal lump, and a bee-line in Space
isn’t straight—it is crooked or possibly bow-
legged. When the disembodied ghost has
come back, after scooting across all the
infinity and eternity it can lay its hands on
at the. moment, it may put in another in-
carnation, and then die and start to put in
another eternity or another infinity, but
it will only be travelling the same
or a similar road over again. In
about one case out of a billion a rein-
carnated spirit is recognisable, and then
there are some scant and sketchy data to
go upon. Thus there is a stack of circum-
stantial or circumferential evidence to sup-
port the contention that Henry of Navarre

was Darius I. of Persia doing his bit over
again. Cleopatra, whose second husband
was Caesar, the uncrowned King of Rome,
did another appearance as Kitty O’Shea,
whose second husband was Parnell, the
uncrowned King of Ireland. These were two
instances to go on with. If we could dis-
cover how many leagues per second ghosts
travel between incarnations (and Cleopatra
O’Shea was a lady of velocity) then Einstein
might figure how far Space is across, or if
Einstein could estimate the size of Space
to begin with, then we might work out the
speed of an express spectre between its
death and its new birth. But it will require
a navigator of tonnage to take the neces-
sary observations.
“Penfield”: The stoppage of the “Evening
News” breaks the last link between Sydney
journalism and Henry Parkes. Parkes
started the “Empire” in 1850, a couple of
years after he had begun to make his little,
high-pitched voice heard, and kept it going
for nine years. Then Samuel Bennett, who
had been brought; to Australia to pick up
type fo’r Stevens and Stokes, who owned the
“S. M. Herald” those days, joined up with
William Hanson, bought the “Empire,” and
soon afterwards started the “Evening News,”
Sydney’s first attempt at a daily afternoon
paper. That was in ’67; so the coffin which
Associated News, Ltd., has got ready fo'r
the family vault will record that this child
of the Bennetts reached the age of 64 3 r ears.
The “Town and Country Journal,” another
child, was for some obscure reason permitted
to die a while ago', after a useful life of over
50 years. “Sydney Mail,” which still issues
weekly from the Fairfax office, was 10 years
the old “Down and Gumtree’s” senior, having
been born in 1860. It was the office of the
“Evening News” and “Town and Country”
which made things so comfortable foT Hen-
niker Heaton (originally a canvasser on
the staff) that he was able by and bye to
retire to England (he married one of the
Bennett girls), become M.P. for Canterbury,
pioneer Imperial Penny Postage, and die a
baronet.

“Pawang” : The Bulletin musical critic’s
recent commendation of community singing
is heartily endorsed by at least one Mel-
bourne specialist. He prescribes one hour

Bolt” and “Silver Threads Amongst the Gold”
has made new men and women of many of
them.

“Yorky”: ILawkes Bay (M.L.), which has
received so much prominence from the recent
earthquake, was named by Captain Cook
after the sea-do'g who beat the
French at Belleisle (1759) and be-
came First Lord of the Admiralty
and a peer in 1776. Co'ok called it
“Plawke Bay,” and as such it
appears on the older maps; the “s”
has crept ini unwarrantably, as it so
often does in English place names.
The present Baron Hawke is the
seventh of his line. His honors have
been mostly won on the cricket field,
but his brother, the heir-presumptive,
is a retired admiral.
“Oxmead”: The estimate of geologists that
it takes 32,000 years or so to form a single
inch of stalactite (B. 25/2/’3l) reminds me
of a deputation from the goldfields unem-
ployed that went to Perth about 28 years ago,
headed by a red-whiskered Irishman named
Malachi Dwyer and an argumentative Welsh-
man of the clan Cadwallader. Walter James
was Premier, and, when asked if there was no
Government work available for skilled miners
out of a job, he suggested that perhaps a few
might be absorbed in the development of the
Yalingup caves, which were just then being
opened up for the delectation of tourists. On
leaving the Premier’s office the leaders dis-
cussed the proposition. “What sort of
work would they put miners at in those
caves?” asked “Cad” of liis colleague.
Malachi could tell you all about the history
of Ireland from the days of Brian Boru and
Ms own golden-collared ancestor, and he
had some smattering of modern economics
but his answer showed that he was weak on
geological processes. “Making those blanky
stalactites there’s so much in the papers
about, I shouldn’t wonder,” he grumbled

“Ida D.”: Estancia Pilcaneu, where the
Prince of Wales is booked to stay a nMht
on his journey from Chile to Buenos Ayres
lies on a high plateau in the foothills of
the Andes where the wind blows cease-
lessly and the temperature often falls below
zero. For some years after the war this
estancia was managed by G. IT. Dawson
son of R. W. Dawson, sometime stock
inspector at Goulburn (N.S.W.) ; it is
now run by Don Tom Norris, formerly of
Mudgee, general manager for an English
company. The Royal visitors are entering

of the Spanish conquest, and afterwards lost

“D.” : One of the interesting truths which
Melba’s career proved was that the average
“expert” isn’t an expert at all. When she
reached London in
1886 as Helen Arm-
strong she had already
won fame in Australia.
Sullivan heard her
and considered her
voice “mediocre”; he
strongly discouraged
her from taking up
music as a career.
Parry, the other musi-
cal knight of the
period, got such unfav-
orable reports of her
singing from friends
that he refused to
hear her at all. If
Marchesi hadn’t hap-
pened to give her a
trial she might have
remained in obscurity
for years. A while
before Jo'hn Morley
and Meredith, as read-
ers for famous pub-
lishing firms, had
turned down novels by
Hardy on the ground,
chiefly, that the
people in them were
“unreal,” and promi-
nent critics continued
to disparage Hardy to
the end. It is said to
be the reason why he
abandoned novel-writ-
ing for poetry towards
the close of his life.
Melba made her name
on the Continent-
first in Brussels and
later in Paris —and
eminent Londoners
might still have said
she was mediocre if
she hadn’t enraptured
the Prince of Wales
and his friends and
become the fashion.
I can’t think of one
front-ranker in either
poetry or pictorial art who wasn’t condemned
as a dud at the beginning of his career by
authoritative contemporaries.

“Strict Veg.” : A photo, in a Melb. daily
depicting Queenie, the Zoo elephant, squirt-
ing water over a crowd of panic-stricken
children has a story behind it. The press-
man was assured by the attendants that he
would never get any such picture, as Queenie
was too much of a lady to throw water over
anybody. However, the photographer went
ahead. He bribed some children to stand in
front of the animal and rush screaming
away every time she lifted her proboscis,
and took several exposures of the spectacle.
To the amazement and disgust of the Zoo
authorities, when the photo, appeared Queenie
was revealed behaving in the way they said
she couldn’t. On liis way to the office the
pressman had looked in at the Botanic
Gardens and got a gardener to hold the
nozzle of a two-incli hose so that lie could
snap the jet of water. To combine the two
plates was an easy matter.
“Light Horse”: The other day a Sydney
tennis-player got a headline all to herself
when an evening paper discovered that she
habitually ate sugar to sustain her in her
matches. Yet the virtues of the stuff, for
exhausted animals as well as tired humans,
ought to he well known. Sugar-mill cattle
in the West Indies received molasses as part
of their daily ration a couple of centuries
ago, and the practice was later followed in
Queensland. When Plumer’s flying column
in South Africa was engaged in running
down scattered Boer commandoes half a
pound of brown sugar was fed twice a day
to the horses as a stamina-improver. A
regular ration with the Light Horse mounts
in Sinai-Palestine was sucrepaille, a chopped,
straw-molasses mixture. The nags loved it
as much as they did the ripe dates in the
Sinai palm-hods, and to this constant sugar
ration much of the remarkable endurance
which characterised the Australian Walsr
on that arduous campaign was certainly due.

“S.T.S.”: Adelaide’s vanished “Register”
(B. 25/2/’3l), the second number of which
was printed on the beach at Glenelg at
Christmas, 1836, had things all its own way
until the ’fifties. Then appeared the “Adver-
tiser,” in the popular or anti-squatters
interest; and when it came down to Id.,
while the “Register” stayed for years at
2d., it got a lead that was never overtaken.
Later, under the capable Bonytlion rule, the
moderate “ ’Tiser” took all the increasing
Labor patronage, as against the hard-shell
“Register.” Still, under Kyflin Thomas
ownership and the editorial lead of Finlay-
son and Sowden, the old paper was a power
in the State till well after the war.

“Monte” : Bowlette is ousting minny golf
in Sydney. It was bound to happen. Asa device
for separating the speculative from their cash
bowlette has the basic appeal of every public
gamble in the world. It costs nothing to
watch (I counted over 100 onlookers in a
city bowlette hall recently, and, as happens
at roulette, those who came to scoff remained
to play, in most cases) ; results are quick,
and there is always a chance of a good win,
though the odds are, of course, heavily on the
“bank.” For 6d. the patron is allowed three
howls at about a dozen pegs. He has to
come round an obstacle to reach them, and
even if he doesn’t miss altogether it is easy
to go through the lot. The minny golfer
pays up to a shilling and averages half an
hour a round; the bowletter’s sixpence
doesn’t keep him in the limelight for more
than three minutes. As there is hardly any
overhead —no half-acre plot to lease as in
minny golf, no elaborate lighting system, no
groundsmen, and no clubs to buy and keep
in repair—someone is going to make a lot
of money out of the bowlette dives before
they go the way of the minny courses, which
are already beginning to figure in the bank-
ruptcy notices.

“Bloggs”: A recent Sunday tour of the
chief oratorical pitches in Sydney Domain
revealed that there wasn’t a single Aussie
providing the public with political, religious
and sociological uplift; From the midst of
the biggest gathering came the Glasgie bellow
of Donald Grant. Another Scot —a stunted
being who looked like a worker about the
body and an actor about the head—was talk-
ing economics under a red flag. A pallid,
thin-lipped female with a Czechoslovakian
accent, or something similar, and untidy
stockings called for a general strike, and a
member of England’s Pankhurst family re-
commended moderation. An almost incom-
prehensible Swede banged a volume which
might have been either the Bible or “Das
Kapital,” and near him a rationalist (either
a Scot or a Yorkshireman) was getting-
laughs at the expense of Christianity. The
audiences seemed to be almost exclusively
Australian except for a couple of enraged
old Irishmen who kept interrupting the
rationalist and getting the worst of it. It
was all curiously symbolic. There arc uo
people in the world to equal Australians for
letting impostors from overseas do their
thinking for them.

They come and go, who hold that magic key,
That sesame, the centuries along,
To witch the world with matchless melody
And ravish it with song.
They rule of right. Theirs is the gift that
brings
Man as a brotherhood beneath its spell;
All theirs, unasked, allegiance never kings
Could boast, or queens compel.
What soaring ecstasy, what wild desire,
Regrets to sadden, triumphs to rejoice,
What love to light like flame or burn like
fire
Rang in that golden voice!
They come to gladden and they go to leave
A stillness, and a shadow where they
shone —
As dusk that deepens on an English eve
When nightingales are gone.
Hushed is the voice that held its sovereign
sway
Across the wide demesne no bordering
shore
May bound nor any severing sea may stay.
Ah! who shall wear such crown for many a
day
As that our Melba wore ?

A JUDICIAL DISTINCTION.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
“Timon”: The story was printed the other
day of how a M.L. doctor had purchased
Sunday Island, somewhere within the
Dominion bailiwick, and proposed to settle
a small self-contained population upon it.
The report has since been denied, on the
ground that only a few hundred acres of the
island are purchasable. It is to be hoped
it is so, for such schemes invariably come,
to grief. The infernal monotony of always
seeing the same faces and hearing the old
arguments and jokes engenders a murderous
hatred among the members of the commu-
nity, and the show breaks up with all the
abandon of an exploding Cornish boiler.
That is why so many prospectors work by
themselves. On a well-filled field, as in a
Well-filled city, there is always relief of a
sort from the banalities of a mate or mates.
In the solitude of the bush and the ranges
it is a different matter, and that accounts
for the hatter.

“Don Jose” : An additional reason why the
roll of consuls in Sydney includes representa-
tives of so many comparatively insignificant
foreign nations was supplied by a recently
published list of persons whose official posi-
tions entitle them to free passes over the
railways. It’s a sort of international compli-
ment, one supposes, doubtless reciprocated
wherever possible, and nobody would grudge
the concession to full-time legates. But the
disclosure that the Consul for Ecuador is
accorded the same privilege as the repre-
sentative of France or Italy sets one won-
dering how often the services of the former
gentleman are requisitioned by anybody in
these parts. Ecuador —the geographical situa-
tion is indicated by its name —is a chunk of
South America that split off from Peru over

a couple of millions or so, “mostly descen-
dants of Spaniards, aboriginal Indians
and mestizoes.” Unless it is Panama hats,

we import anything from there, or what
return, direct or indirect, N. S. Wales gets
for the free carriage of an Ecuadorian, or
a spokesman for the republic, over its

“Hotham”: Two of the most unusual
motor-transport passengers on record landed
in Melbourne last week from Darwin. Ihey
were N.T. buffaloes. One was among the
three imported from Timor by Maurice
Barlow in 1924; the other is a mere pup of
three years. The pair were brought all the
way down from Darwin in a motor-lorry, a
remarkable feat considering the unwieldy
size and infernal disposition of these beasts.
“Uramao” : On the authority of Professor
David, Maoriland, from south of Timaru to
Invarcargill and across to Milford Sound, is
strongly buttressed by a rock rampart against
the upward thrust of Pacific-hatched ’quakes.
Yet raised heaclies along Otago and South-
land coasts show that titanic forces have
been at work in those parts in the dim past.
An old historian, the Rev. Richard Taylor,
has told of the experience of sealers over a
century ago at Dusky Sound, on the extreme
south-west coast of M.L. From 1824 to 1827
there was a series of severe ’quakes in this
region; once the island on which the sealers
camped became so agitated that they put to
sea thinking it was due for submergence,
but the flux and reflux of the ocean drove
them to land again. One deep-water cove
used by them dried up, whole hillsides came
down, and parts of the coast were altered
almost out of recognition.

“J.It.K.”: They move fast in Fleet-street

world of the demolition of Napier was sent
by the wireless operator of the s.s. Tara-

stead. An hour and a half later the sender

“Centurion”: I note with interest that
General Ho Ying Ching, of China, has
drafted a. set of rules to keep down the
expenditure of military officers. For instance,
a general may not spend more for a Chinese
dinner for 10 persons than the equivalent of
£2 10s.; colonels are limited to £2 and
lieutenants to £l. No
mention seems to be made
Of majors, notoriously a
free-handed lot. The idea
of protecting the warrior'
from excessive hospitality
is a good one, though it
has been my experience
that the higher he rises in
rank the less he exposes
himself to it. An over-
looked point is the protec-
tion of junior officers from
exploitation by their
seniors. The brass-hat who
lets his staff-officer foot
the bill and then forgets to
square up is a familiar
figure. One famous brig,

ance had only to appear in the bars or dining-

ably a large bottle of Bollinger.

“J. Flatfoot” : The two Papuan mariners
who saved the life of Mrs. Berge after the
capsize of a launch in the Gulf of Papua,
which resulted in the loss of her husband

Lloyd’s will hand out its medal for saving
life at sea—the most coveted distinction of
the kind in existence. This medal is struck
in silver and bronze, the former for special
individual feats. All and sundry are eligible
and at least two women are entitled to hoist
it. One is stewardess Gilmour, of the
steamer Sardinia, a silver medallist; and
the other Madame Matelot widow of a
Breton lighthouse-keeper, who received the
bronze decoration. No colored man has yet
acquired the sdver medal, but quite a num-

“Mells” : When Andy Fisher rose to great-
ness, incidents of the days when lie earned
his living underground as a miner were
eagerly published and read. One old col-
liery-mate mentioned that Andy was in the
habit of covering the sides of trucks with
strings of figures representing calculations
on the market value of shares held by lnm,
and that the locality where he was working
could generally be ascertained by these sunis
in addition and multiplication, lhere was
a vague idea that this sort of thing lndi-
cated Scotch canniness and an appreciation
of the value of money highly desnable m a
Federal Treasurer, and possibly it did. Some-
how it seems even easier to picture Theo-
dore, the present Labor Treasurer, scrawling
estimates of the value of his modest invest-
ments on the sides of trucks, for he, too,
worked as a miner, and that in four different
States: but there is no such legend in his
case. It may be that he had more aptitude
for carrying figures in his head than the
plodding Fisher possessed.

stock on the orthodox form, adding as a
postscript “I also need candles.” A clerk
turned up a corner, and minuted the inquiry
“What do you want candles for?” Hennessy
bent up the other corner and replied, “To
burn. I thought even an Education clerk
would know I didn’t want to eat them.”

“Whitehall” : One result of £l3O Australian
being worth only £lOO in Britain is that
many members of Australia’s leisured classes
who didn’t think of investing capital abroad
before the slump are beginning to
trickle back. Callous friends
refer to them as “returned emp-
ties.” Now most of these people
are by no means hard up in Aus-
tralian money, and they have
acquired a taste for idling in com-
fort. It is a great chance for
Australia to lay the foundations
of a.tourist trade. Trout-fishing
in Victoria and in some parts of
N. S. Wales is better than any-
thing of the sort ( i.e inland, as
distinguished from sea trout-
fishing at the mouths of rivers)
in Britain or Europe. Our duck-
sliooting is splendid. Big-game
fishing (tunny, kingfish and Span-
ish mackerel) can be got as near
Sydney as Port Stephens. And
there are dozens of other sports.
Unfortunately they never get any
publicity, and anyone who goes
in for them can rely oU being-
made thoroughly uncomfortable.
Improved transport, better service
(and that doesn’t mean coolie
service, but merely an honest
effort to make things as pleasant
as possible fo'r those who are
bringing money to the district)
and good food, well cooked and
served, are the chief requirements.
Also, there will have to be some
modification o'f the system under
which meals are unobtainable in
hotels, etc., outside certain hours.
Once our own idle rich start tour-
ing the Commonwealth for plea-
sure rich foreigners will follow
suit. France founded her most profitable
industry by turning fishing villages like
Dinard and Deauville into luxury resorts.

breaker entered a leading jeweller’s and
began to clear the window. Passers-by gave
him no more than careless glances, and the
policeman on his beat gazed benevolently at
the industrious worker who flourished an
out-size duster among the silverware and
jewel-cases. Just then the chemist next
door, whose child had been taken ill, and
who had come from his home to' procure
remedies, noticed the unfamiliar worker. His
suspicions being awakened, he hired a stray
youth to take the medicine to his home, and
went to the nearest ’phone to ask his
jeweller-neighbor who the strange man was.
Things happened rapidly after that; the
booty that was found ready for removal
wouid have ensured a thrifty burglar inde-
pendence for life.
“Shake” : The raising of the sea floor at
Napier has been responsible for some curious
happenings. One was the discovery, where
deep water had been, of two office safes
which had vanished after a burglary last
year. Another was the stranding of a
number of launches and yachts, which are
now resting on a mixture of sand and decay-
ing shellfish a thousand yards from the
water’s edge. It will be impossible to get
some of the larger craft afloat again unless
another earthquake comes along and puts
the sea back where it was before. Queens-
land saw something of the sort in 1898, when
a flood landed a gunboat in the middle of
the Botanic Gardens. There it remained until
another flood obligingly washed it back into
the river a week or so later.

“ J.”: I foresee one pleasing result of the
depresh. Names will be simpler in business.
In the boom days a common type of financier
wasn’t satisfied to be plain J. Smith. He
turned himself into J. Adolphus Smith, and
often, if the cash continued to come m,
adopted a hyphen. Now such people are
going insolvent—there is a close connection
between flamboyancy and bankruptcy—and
their elaborate names are helping to publish
the fact to the world. Shakspeare had the
right idea, as usual:—
When beggars die there are no comets seen;
The heavens themselves blaze forth the death of
princes.
My tip is that when the reconstruction period
arrives most of our bust princes of com-
merce will have learnt their lesson, and
will come to financial life again with the
most unobtrusive monikers they can find.

“Morimoto”: The Japanese have found a
use for the pole-sitter. Recently the workers
in the Fuji Spinning Company’s mill at
Kawasaki went out on strike in protest
against a cut in wages. The employers
refusing to come to terms, the strikers paid
an agent to climb a 200-foot chimney in the
mill yard and stay there until they capitu-
lated. The Oriental Stylites remained aloft
for 100 hours, defying the police and draw-
ing the attention of the entire nation. The
strikers got what they wanted.
* * * *
“Nakhoda”: The humble push-bike fur-
nishes an example of the growth of a taboo
amongst whites in Asia. As a young man I
pedalled hundreds of miles in the Straits
Settlements and parts adjacent: thence I took
my Adelaide-made bike to Java, and finally
gave it to an ex-headhunter in Borneo when
I discovered that there were only five miles
of road around my station. To-day, although
white men and women still pedal happily
about in Dutch Java, the bicycle has become
bad form in British Malaya. When an Eng-
lish author, Richard Sydney, recently set
out to cycle from Penang to Singapore, the
press reported his progress as if he were
doing something extraordinary and dan-
gerous, if not socially reprehensible. Pnc
motor-car has helped greatly to the increase
of that form of snobbery which does more
harm to the white man’s health in the
tropics than the climate —the belief that
wholesome perspiration is only for coolies.
The curious thing is that the Caucasian is
adopting this view just at the time that the
upper-class Chinaman is cutting his nans
short and abandoning it.

“Teddy Hall” : Sydney Sussex, Cambridge,
scene of one of the most amazing cases ot
suicide (or murder) on record —a dead fresh-
man was found “completely bound up, and
gagged with eight handkerchiefs” is one
of the smallest of the colleges that make up
the ’Varsity. Mo'st Oxford and Cambridge
colleges have been the subject of satiric
Limericks, written in the days when, the
last line in this form of literary competition
was a mere liark-back to the first. I have
never been able to forget the one that was
fastened on this particular hall of learning.
It ran:—
There was a young man of Syd. Sussex
Who insisted that w + x
Was the same as xw.
But they said, “Sir, we’ll trouble you
To confine that idea to Syd. Sussex.
Nevertheless, perhaps the most eminent
Cantab who ever lived was a Byd. busses
man. Oliver Cromwell was there.
“In the Sydney Divorce Court, Justice Stephen
said that he did not Regard ‘Ina dear’ at the
.beginning of a letter as' a mere variant of ‘Dear
Ina’; it implied more in the nature of endearment.’’
Lotharios, who pen those risky letters
Tliat all too often the material give
For loosening of matrimonial fetters,
Be careful where you put the adjective.
To “dear” in front of her whom you’re
addressing
No .subtle import e’er can be assigned;
If carries no suggestion of caressing;
But Judges may regard it as expressing
All that and more—behind.
“Dear Millie” ! Nobody can raise objections
To that. It leaves a fellow’s conscience
clear
Of paltering with feminine affections;
But, oh! ’tis otherwise with “Millie dear.”
That such a word gains ardor as an ending
Some dry-as-dust professors may dispute,
But little heed they’ll lend to such contending,
You’re liable to find, if you’re defending
A breach-of-promise suit.
The precedent may set precisians snarling
Dissent, and asking why, if this is so,
There’s nought to differentiate “Florence
darling”
(In warmth, it’s understood) from “Dar-
ling Flo.”
I doubt such nuances of bill-and-coo-ing
Have place in any book on legal shelves.
So you must needs conclude, as I am doing,
Their Honors, in the days when they went
wooing,
Dropped to the dilf. themselves.

“10-2-4” : People of importance in England
loved Melba, and the royalties loved her best
of all. Why? Not because she had a great
voice and knew how to use it, but because she
was at all times herself. To amend Kipling,
she walked with kings, and kept the common
touch. Most Anglo-Australian women are
agonisingly genteel; Melba never was. Far
from trying to hide her Australian manner
and accent she tended to accentuate them;
she loved life and a joke, and there wasn’t
an ounce of snobbishness in her composition.
Nearly all artists, and particularly singers,
cultivate “temperaments,” and revolt those
around them by their affectations. Melba had
no more temperament than a good Equity
“silk,” and she was entirely without pretence.
She had her weaknesses of course, chief
amongst them being the defects of her power-
ful character, such as a desire to domineer;
but. they were few and insignificant by com-
parison with her good qualities. Whereas
mosj; women are natural suburbanites, Melba
was a natural royalty. No wonder those
cheery democrats Edward VII., the present
King and the Prince made a fuss of her
wherever she went. She was their spiritual
sister.
This isn’t the first time Frank Anstey has
been in trouble with an Australian Govern-
ment. During the war he was such an
“anti” that a muzzle was put on him. In
1918 he was issued a passport to go to
x\merica and Europe; but it was only on
one condition—that he gave an undertaking
not to make any speeches. Subsequently
this requirement was varied, and he was per-
mitted to speak so long as he didn’t refer
to the war. In those days Anstey expected
that the armies would throw down their
weapons and join in a grand revolution
which would kill war for all time. After
meeting Tommy, and listening to him, he
turned from him in despair, though he con-
tinued to have some hopes of the French
Army almost to the end.
Allan Guy is ex-Federal Treasurer Joe
Lyons’s faithful second, and always ready
to put on the gloves in his chief’s absence
and in his cause. He was born into' politics:
his father was one of the earliest of Tas-
manian Labor Senators. When Lyons
formed his Tasmanian Government in 1923
he appointed his friend Guy Minister for
“STICKETH CLOSER THAN A
BROTHER.”
Mines, and later, on a reconstruction, lifted
him to the Chief Secretaryship. Both are
Tasmanian-born, but Lyons can give the
other 11 years—one is 52, the other only
41. They both began early: Guy was presi-
dent of the Eight-hour Committee at his
native Launceston at 25.
C. 11. Chomley is the author of the goods-
standard scheme of currency reform which
N.S.W. Premier Lang is advocating,
obviously without knowing much about it.
Chomley, born in Victoria, has buzzed into
many flowers. He was a lawyer who tired
of law and a farmer who tired of farming,
and is a journalist who finds himself getting
old. In his old Melbourne days he wrote
“Mark Meredith,” a socialist tale; and in
London, among lots besides, “Land Values
Taxation, the Essential Reform.” To-day
he is a currency reformer; and before he
dies Buddhism may be the hope of tht world.
For years past he has been editing the
“British Australasian.”
Cecil Leys, Maoriland’s only newspaper
knight now that George Fenwick has gone,
is shaping to be the Northcliffe of the
Shivery Isles. Inheriting from his father,
Dr. T. W. Leys, the control of the “Auck-
land Star,” lie has for years been that jour-
nal’s editor and a director of the Brett Co.
CECIL LEYS, .
M.L. newspaper chief.
When the “Star’s”
cushy job as
Auckland’s only
evening paper
was challenged by
the establishment
of the “Sun,”
Leys took tile
war into the
enemy’s camp, as
it were, by a
merger with the
Christchu rcli
Times Co., which
runs in addition
to a morning
journal a rival to
the Christchurch
“Sun.” The Auck-
land “Sun” pet-
ered out soon
afterwards, bought
out by the Bretts,
and the brow of
Cecil Leys is at
present slightly
ruffled over liti-
gation concerning
the valuation of
the “Sun’s” Auckland building and site. The
“Auckland Star’s” editor saw service in
Mesopotamia as an officer of the R.N.V.iv.
during the Great War. Like his father, he
has made many gifts to his native Auckland.
Scots’ Church, where the Right Rev. Dr.
Borland delivered the funeral oration over
the remains of Melba, was built by the great
singer’s father. She sang in the choir as a
small girl, and occasionally after she became
world-famous.
In the late Leslie Arnott, governing direc-
tor for 40 years of the famous biscuit firm,
Australia loses a business man of rare enter-
prise and initiative. Born at West Maitland
(N.S.W.) in 1856, he did for the biscuit-
making business in Australia work on the
lines of those which made Huntley and
Palmer household words in England 60 years
ago. Every innovation and improvement
he investigated, journeying many times to
Europe for the purpose, and he neglected no
new process which he decided was worth
adoption. His restless energy and keenness
had their fruits in an ever-expanding busi-
ness, and no man was better served, for he
studied employees’ interests as well as his
own. A younger brother, Colonel J. M.
Arnott, served through the war, commanding
the 7th Light Horse at Gallipoli.
Samuel Joseph Dawson, hotelkeeper at
Hamilton (Tas.), who passed out at 50 the
other day, was the hero of the Mount Lyell
disaster in 1912, and winner of the D.C.M.
and M.M. for conspicuous bravery when
serving with the Desert Column in Palestine.
Dawson was a mining engineer; he risked
his own life to make several rescues from
the North Lyell mine. His D.C.M. came
after he swam the Jordan at night, landing
within a, yard or two of one of Jerry’s sen-
tries, wfitli the rope which formed the link
for the bridging gang to enable the troops
to cross. Promotion to sergeant and decora-
tion by Allenby followed. The M.M. came to
him for the capture of a machine-gun.
Fred Robertson, after some 40 years as
associate editor of Adelaide “Advertiser” —
and during Langdon Bonython’s time in
E'ederal politics Robertson was something
more than “associate”—is taking his first
real holiday. It is a health trip, too, that he
makes to Europe.
Dr. M. F. IT. Gamble, who passed out at
Kew (Vic.) last week, was for many years
superintendent of the Kew Hospital for the
Insane. He retired a few years ago and
practised privately as a mental specialist.
ITis dad was a senior inspector of State
schools.
A little-known Federal official has been
killed in a street accident in London. He
was Frank Gibson, art adviser to the
Commonwealth. A student of the National
Gallery, Melbourne, he went to the Slade
School in 1888, but became better known
in the Cold Land as an art critic than a
painter. From 1908 to 1914 Gibson was
adviser to the Felton Bequest, and received
his full share of abuse for his selections of
pictures. The war caused a suspension of
the flow of old masters and alleged old
masters to Australia, just as an exchange
rate of £3O per cent, has stopped it to-day.
Allan Brown, first winner of the Whitting-
ham scholarship, is a Queenslander, like the
late founder of the scholarship and his family
before him —they were well-known figures in
the squattocracy of the northern State.
Educated at Geelong Grammar School, the
beneficiary under the bequest of that Whit-
tingham who was himself a pupil there goes
up to New College in October.
“White Peak”: Alex. Peacock may hold
the belt as the sometime Premier whose term
of office dates back furthest (B. 18/2/’3l),
but septuagenarian Ned Wittenoom, of West-
ralia, was an acting-Premier years before*
Alex, was a whole-time one. Ned was head
of the Government for six months as long
ago as 1897, when his chief, John Forrest,
was in England taking part in the Diamond
Jubilee celebrations.
T. 11. Morrow, from Parramatta :
I am described (B. 18/2/’3l) as a one-time
Laborite, which I am not. On my arrival from
the north of Ireland, 19 years ago, I joined the
Nationalist (then Liberal) party, and have been a
member of it ever since.
J. T. Collins, just retired from the job
of Vic. Parliamentary draughtsman, has
given legal form to the promises of politi-
cians for two decades. A Castlemaine boy,
he went from the local grammar school to
Trinity College, and was for many years a
University lecturer. He is a trustee of the
Public Library, the Museum and the Nat.
Gallery, and he found time to write a book
on local government which earned him a
C.M.G. Poet Bernard O’Dowd moves up to
the vacant position.
“0.P.H.” : Governor-General Isaacs, when
a member of Vic. Assembly in 1893, did more
than resign his portfolio when he found him-
self out of step with his colleagues (B.
11/2/’3l). He resigned his seat (Bogong)
as well, and offered himself for re-election.
Nobody dared enter the lists against him,
and he was returned unopposed. It is a
precedent unlikely to be followed by any of
his present lot of Ministers.
E. W. Holden, who is to be chairman of
General Motors and Holdens, Ltd., the new
co. which has merged the two biggest con-
cerns in the Australian motor trade, is a son
of the man who founded the Holden busi-
ness ; in former days the firm was Holden
and Frost, harness-makers and saddlers.
Holden, sen., built well: one boy, Ted, he
E. W. HOLDEN, chairman of the new
motor-trade merger, General Motors and
Holdens, Ltd.
trained for the technical side of the busi-
ness (he is a B.Sc. of Adelaide Uni.).;
another for office work. It was during his
third tour of the workshops of the world
that E. W. Holden got into touch with the
head serangs of General Motors, for whom
his co. had been building thousands of bodies;
and the final result was this recently
announced merger. H* is 45.
Hugh Gunn, dead in London at 61, was a
Scotsman and a noted educationist whose
work was Empire-wide. He became pro-
minent in South Africa after the Boer War,
as a leading member of the conference that
came to an agreement. with the Boer repre-
sentatives on the subject of a dual official
language for the Union ; he was also on the
governing council of the University of the
Cape of Good Hope and a member of the
first Imperial Council on Education. In
Australia he wall be remembered as the organ-
iser of the University of W.A. in 1912. Gunn
saw active service in the Great War and
later went to the Ministries of Munitions,
Pensions and Labor as liaison officer. He
w’as one of South Africa’s best golfers in
his day.
TOM JOHNSTONE, chief railway auditor
of Queensland.
M. G. Skipper: In writing on the demise
of the S.A. “Register,” “Penfield” (B.
25/2/’3l) mentions my grandfather, J. M.
Skipper, who married the daughter of the
first proprietor. An obituary of the “Regis-
ter” might also include a reference to my
father, S. J. Skipper. It may be merely
hero-worship, but I have always imagined
that, as “Hugh Kalyptus,” he made the
“Register” as much a household word in
one State as James Edmond did The Bul-
letin in six. His humor was of the domes-
tic and intimate variety, and when “Tommy
Rough,” which was I, had mumps or measles,
the whole State was told 4 about it in verse,
which I, for one, regarded as matchless. S. J.
Skipper admired Mark Twain immensely and
prided himself on a physical likeness to that
great humorist, a likeness which Twain
remarked himself when he visited Adelaide.
He was a keen cyclist, and one of the works
he was proudest of was a road map of South
Australia, every mile of which he had
explored in person. One of his multitudinous
activities was dramatic criticism, and amongst
my childish memories are the spectacle of
Mrs. Brown-Potter sweeping up our garden
path in an enormous picture hat, with her
train making a miniature dust-storm behind
her; and of him backing reverentially out
of the presence of Sarah Bernhardt and
falling over a large mastiff in the process.
He had the rare quality of never barbing
his shafts with malice.
Archibald Kerr Clark, who is to be British
Minister at Stockholm, is an Australian.
He has been moving steadily up the Diplo-
matic Service ladder for over 20 years. A
brother, Robin, was one of the late Sir
Harry Rawson’s A.D.C.’s in Sydney; he
married into the British peerage, and was
killed early in the war. Their mother was
a daughter of old John Robertson, the N. S.
Wales politician. She married a Scot who
made money on the land in Australia, and
settled in London with her family after his
death.
The biggest man, physically as well as
officially, in the Vic. railways electrical
branch is George Samuel Scott, who installed
all the overhead equipment for Melbourne’s
suburban rail electrification and has been
overhead superintendent in Clapp’s show'
since 1918. He tips the scale at over .15
stone, and in 1911 was England’s champion
amateur heavyweight wrestler. Scott has
been building electric railways and tramways
since he was 17. He carried through electrical
installations in Spain, Brazil and Bombay
as a resident engineer, and directed the electri-
fication of the London, Brighton and South
Coast railway in 1908.
Bulletin contributor lon Idriess wrote
a letter to the Sydney dailies giving
a few concise hints to would-be gold-hunters.
Within 24 hours he had received hundreds of
letters asking for more or seeking his co-
operation in prospecting expeditions. Idriess
spent 16 years in North Australia, New
Guinea and parts adjacent as prospector, san-
dalwood-getter, pearler and seaman. He has
lived among the aborigines of Cape York Pen-
insula and the islanders of Torres Strait; one
of his sea trips took him 16,000 miles in a
27ft. cutter manned by himself and another.
He has been up the Fly River, and up the
Mai Ivussas towards the Tugeri country,
near the rarely-visted Dutch border. Idriess’s
novel “Madman’s Island” (published by
Angus and Robertson) is four-fifths per-
sonal experience. A war diary dealing with
the Sinai and Palestine campaigns, in which
he served with the'Light Horse, is in the
hands of a London publisher. - For the last
year or two Idriess has been freelancing in
Sydney.

To have put up a factory and plant with
a book value of £811,437, paid £SB,S9S in
pref. divs., accumulated £322,871 of reserves
and exhibited a more or less liquid surplus
of £323,433 at Dec. 31 last, all within four
years, is the achievement of this subsidiary
of the big Goodyear Tyre and Rubber Go.,
Akron (U.S.A.). Formed in 1926 it inherited
a ready-made trade connection and exten-
sive goodwill developed by an import-
ing offshoot, which the parent had set
up there in 1915, But no value was
given to goodwill in the book. The
parent, which decided to manufacture here
owing to pressure of the tariff, took all the
half-million ords. for cash, and the Austra-
lian public was offered and quickly snapped
300,000 8 p.c. cum. prefs., making paid capi-
tal £BOO,OOO.
Times were prosperous, and with every-
thing right on the technical side and all the
financial backing it required, the co.’s diffi-
culty was not so much to win orders as to
cope with their volume. The capacity of
the plant was doubled ; the running of the
machines to capacity and increased produc-
tion efficiency helped costs down considerably,
and some glittering results were achieved.
After paying the pref. div., enough was
netted to show 45 p.c. on the ord. capital m
1929 as against 21.2 p.c. for the previous
term.
Last year the outlook changed color. Com-
paring the six months to Dec. 31, 1929, with
the corresponding period 1930, imports of
crude rubber fell from £621,622 to' £180,970
—certainly the spot price for crude had
dropped from 74d. to Obviously the
turnover of tyre manufacturers received a
nasty jolt; and though they have not suf-
fered to anything like the same extent as the
car trade, with this co‘. there was a sharp
contraction of £165,762 in profit. Even
then it was nearly 3J times the pref.
requirements, after allowing for which there
was enough to show 11.9 p.c. on the oru.
capital. But again no div. was paid, the
parent not being hungry for money and the
i utlook uncertain.
The accumulation_of surplus earnings has
put the finances in fine trim, as this next
comparison of balance-sheet figures shows : —•

During the year the book value of stocks
was worked down £259,541, and cash, etc.,
was strengthened by £264,026. Also £68,095
was knocked off advances from the parent,
which had £1,049,420 of loan and share capi-
tal invested in the business at Dec. 31. The
more or less liquid surplus (£323,433, includ-
ing stocks) was £56,059 stronger than at
the previous balance. Although new plant
for manufacturing rubber-belting, hose, etc.,
was installed, only £3536 was added to the
book value of fixed assets.
Sceptical as to the future, the market
prices the prefs., which carry a fixed cumula-
tive 8 p.c. and have priority as to capital,
at 17s. The return at that figure is 9.4 p.c.;
the backing amounts to £3 14s. lOd. in net
tangibles, of which 21s. 7d. was represented
by surplus liquids.

The success of this lusty youngster is ex-
plained by its close association with the
solidly established Mercantile Mutual; the
control and activities of the two are largely
interlocked. For 17 years it w r as solely a re-
insurance office, sharing the Mercantile’s
risks. It began to deal direct with the public,
and . extended to Melbourne and Adelaide,
about five years ago. From that point the
table takes up the story.
Last year's falter in the expansion of the
figures was due to a shrinkage in motor-car
and Workers’ Compensation business and a
heavier crop of claims, as was common
amongst underwriters. The drop in net pre-
miums was £17,075, as the next table shows:

1930.. 116,026 69,892 48,040 6*3.2 41.4
t Despite a growth of £4757 in taxation and
contributions to fire brigades, there was a
saving of £7701 in exes. Claims were £2054
heavier, so the underwriting result was a
loss of £lOO7 as against a profit of £9522 for
the previous term. Thus a point had to be
knocked off the div., reducing At to 9 p.c.,
though interest and rents (£8485) were equal
to 12.1 p.c. on capital. Over the last five
years returns from investments have exceeded
the dividend charge by £3446, and the net
underwriting surplus was £50,143; thus
reserves of £52,589 had accumulated at Dec-
-31. Though progress promises to be slower
in the future, shareholders are m a very
snug position—always assuming, of course;
that Governments keep faith with their credi-
tors and leave the - currency alone.
Policy-holders need lose no sleep either.
The protection is a bit more than the amount
usually looked for, and assets appear to be
a .solid lot:

This co. took over the cattle-runs of the
Q.M.E. in 1915, and paid divs. averaging
8.4 p.c. for the five years to 1920. Since
then the story has been one of mounting
costs, lost markets, drought and falling
prices. Only twice during the last decade
has the balance been on the right side, aggre-
gate losses exceeding aggregate profits by
£70,832. And since two divs. were paid to
the prefs. the deficit on shareholders’ accounts
had grown to £66,657, or 3s. lOd. per ordi-
nary share at Nov. 30 last.
A few years ago wool offered a way out,
so Tarbrax was turned over to sheep. To
finance the change and the purchase of
Springfield, a cattle-fattening depot near the
N. S. Wales border, £107,249 of 8 p.c. prefs.
was issued; and £12,441 more than the
pref. divs. called for was netted during the
next two years. But drought quickly
withered prospects; agistment and handfeed-
ing costs piled up outgoings, and losses have
since continued to show up.
Last year all the co.’s properties were
in fair condition, but cattle prices eased
and the wool market collapsed, and the loss
on the year’s trading was only £1590 less
than the previous year’s.
Because its cattle from the Gulf runs had
not fetched top prices, the co. bought Lind-
hurst from the Queensland Government as
a resting and fattening depot a couple of
vG&rs ago. It went outside for tlie money?

The business provided a fortune for its
founder, J. C. Williamson, and some rich
returns since he died m 1907 ; but it s
not the moneyspinner it used to be. ine
“talkies” have changed the outlook tor the
entrepreneur of the legitimate stage the wor a
over. And now the public has been com-
pelled to curtail its expenditure on amuse-
ments, which have also been subject to special
taxation. Thus it has come about that the
Williamson organisation, which dominates
the stage in Australia, Maoriland and fe.
Africa, finds itself with too many theatres
on its hands. Some it has leased to the
picture cos., and some it has closed down
altogether, being unsuitable for other pur-
poses without heavy capital outlay.
It all shows up in a sharp drop of
£103,782 in the year’s gross profits:—

Exes., including interest on mortgage and
other borrowings, were got back£34,474.
But it was not enough, and a loss ot £18,004
showed up. That, the pref. div. and a trifle
to the ords. (paid early m the term) bit
into reserves for £39,879. . ,
There was also an unexplained reduction
of £73,509 in the reserves, though aivexplana-
tion is suggested by a reduction of ;£70,328 in
the book value 0 f shares in other cos. lhese
consisted largely of a holding m the big
Hoyts group, which' took over some 50 ot
Williamson’s picture-theatres about five years
ago for scrip, including something for
will. In Sept, last the Fox Film iCorp.,
U.S!A., bought a controlling interest in
Hoyts, which has not paid a div. on its ‘ C
and ordinary shares since 1927. The price
paid by the American co. and whether the
deal included any of J.C.W.’.s ■ holding have
riot been mentioned. „ . ■ » "■ ~ ,
All that can be said definitely is. that
J C.W contemplates a wholesale revision of
the book value of its assets when things be-
come more settled. Here'is the position as
the published figures disclose it:—
1925. 1929. 1930.
Paid capital .. ... £525,000 £525.000 C 525,000

When the books , closed there was £202,057
coming to the bank, and £424,361, to sundry
creditors, including mortgagees and deben-
ture-holders. The lot exceeded ■ cash and
book debts by £230,223; the position having
slipped £18,498 during the year. The sub-
stantial growth in liabilities and book debts
during the last five , years may have some
connection with Hoyts’ activities. The. item
property, etc., including expenditure, on ward-
robes and pieces not yet produced, was
£33,017 lighter than at the previous balance.
The directors have made, ai substantial cut
in their salaries, and the business is. reported
to be profitable again. But to what extent
the improvement is likely to continue is diffi-
cult to say. Payment of the usual quarterly
nref div lias been suspended for the last
six months. The shares-there are 150,000
of them carrying a fixed cumulative 8 p.c.
with priority as to capital—fetch around
16s. on the market. At 16s. the return is
10 p.c.; on paper the net asset backing is
approximately £5, including an unspecified
amount of goodwill. The ords. are not
listed ; they are mostly and closely held by
those in the business.

This is anther concern which has got its
toes trodden on in the scramble to provide
the public with facilities for credit buying.
It was registered in Sydney at the end of
1926. Competition was so severe that, in
order to quickly get a footing and thus
develop a satisfactory turnover, the board
adopted a policy of amalgamation and absorp-
tion.
The banks cast a cold eye on financing
this class of business, so, to coax capital, a
limited number of 10 p.c. cum. prefs. were
put out and 8 p.c. was paid on the ords. for
the first three years, though it was never
really earned. A cash-order contract with
A.8.C., Ltd., which runs a chain of stores in
Queensland, was secured, a string of branches
was opened, and paid capital grew from
£28,134 at Sept. 30, 1927, to £164,591 in
14,015 prefs. and 186,222 ords. at the close
of last accounts; there was then £35,646
to come.
Last year changes in the control followed
wranglings amongst the directors and a sec-
tion of the shareholders ; and an investigation
of the co’s affairs disclosed a loss of £39,604
at June 30 last. That was after striking
off £27,007 for customers’ bad and doubtful
debts dating back to the commencement, and
£4539 on account of a debt due by the
Community General Assurance Co., now in
liquidation. The loss directly ascribed to
the nine months’ trading was £BO5B, due to
income shrinking faster than overhead. The
new board promptly overhauled the organi-
sation, and claims to have placed the business
on a sounder basis. For the three months to
Sept. 30 a net profit of £625 was shown,
thus reducing the loss for the year to
£38,980. That raised the deficit on share-
holders’ account to £51,936, or ss. 9d. per
ordinary share.
The effect of the loss on the finances was
substantially offset by £26,716 of fresh capi-
tal gathered during the year. Here is the
position as balance-sheet figures show it: : —
1927. 1928. 1929. 1930.
Paid capital.. £28,134 £83,638 £137,875 £164,591
Liabilities .. 6,183 10,023 15,127 7,399
Equipment .. 1,165 1,963 2,885 3,477
Book debts . . 20,126 56,848 106,736 80,640
Investments .. 22,981 32,408 33,108
Cash, etc. . . 4,772 2,898 2,571 4,206
Thus the excess of book debts and cash over
liabilities (£77,447 at Sept. 30) slipped only
£16,733 during the 12 months. Shares in
other cos. appear at cost, which may include
something for goodwill; no hint is given as
to what they turn in. There is a contingent
liability of £5lBB, mainly in respect of calls
guaranteed on shares.
The general slump has, of course, caused a
sharp drop in turnover, and put more of an
edge on competition. Results. will depend
largely upon the care with which the man-
agement selects and watches the risks, and
the extent to which overhead can be re-
strained. But there are the intangibles call-
ing for reduction before the ords. can hope
to get much in the way of returns from then-
investment. ' . , ,
When fully paid the prefs., which have
priority as to capital, will call for £l4Ui
p.a. They are covered by net assets with a
book value of £lO 11s. 7d. For the ords. the
net asset cover is 14s. 3d. The scrip is not
listed.

In 1920 this co. took over a 43-year lease,
including a license, of premises opposite the
Australia Hotel. For a while, there was a
danger that it might hamstring itself by hand-
ing out more than it could afford. But
changes in the control were followed by a
marked and consistent improvement in earn-
ings, and the div. climbed rapidly from 9 p.c.
to 15 p.c. during the five years to Oct. 31,
1929 ; far too rapidly considering the'slender-
ness of the support and the extent to whicii
the co. had gone into debt.
To finance the purchase of the freehold
(the price mentioned was £75,000) and make
improvements the board went to its bankers
and others for an extra £88,601 in the 1929
term, raising the outside debt.to £154,641; the
figure was £155,184 at the close of last
accounts. There was then 255. 9d. of outside
money at risk in the business for every £1 or
shareholders’ funds, including £21,347 reserved
against an unspecified amount of goodwill,
etc. Assets were all lumped in one untidy
entry at £277,311, thus obscuring the real
financial position. . .
Last year the general contraction m spend-
ing and the weight of the debt made them-
selves felt. The slip in gross profits (£35,040)
was £13,082, and in the net result £<44o.
Though the net profit claimed was enough
to pay the pref. div. and show 6.5 p.c. ou

the ord. capital, both classes of shareholders
■went hungry. There is nothing to suggest
an early recovery in earnings, and overhead
threatens to remain stubborn. Shareholders’
prospects will look more encouraging when
the heavy outside debt is substantially
reduced.
Paid capital is £BO,OOO in 20,000 S p.c.
cum. prefs. and 60,000 ords. A couple of
years ago the ords. exchanged their shares
for scrip in Carlton Investments, Ltd., a
holding co. with a paid capital of £139,728
in 69,864 7 p.c. cum. prefs. and 139,735 ords.
paid to 10s. each. It owns 59.864 of the
ords. in Carlton Hotel Ltd., and all the 10,000
ords. in the Eneber Investment Co., which
is also interested in hotel properties. For
each share taken over it handed out its own
paper in the proportion of one fully paid
£1 7 p.c. pref., with priority as to capital,
and two £1 ords. paid to 10s. each. Thus
to pay its own pref. div. and 5 p.c. on its
raid up ordinary capital it needs to receive
in divs. an aggregate of 12 p.c. on the face
■value of its holdings in the two operating cos.
Subject to goodwill, the net asset backing
for Carlton Hotel prefs., which come in
front of those of the holding co., is £4 19s. 3d.
They carry a fixed cumulative 8 p.c., and last
year’s profit was nearly three times their
annual requirements. The debt, however,
overshadows the position. The shares have
not an active market.
“Evening News” to Suspend Publication.
After three meetings and a ballot share-
holders of Associated Newspapers (Sydney)
last week accepted by 38,918 votes to 5570
the majority recommendation of the board
to “suspend publication of the ‘Evening
News’ until economic conditions improve.”
This paper, which was founded and built up
by the Bennett family, dates back to 1867.
It is published by S. Bennett, Ltd., which
linked up with Sun Newspapers through
Associated about 16 months ago. Associated
owns all but five of the 425,000 Bennett
shares, which figure in its books at £636,443.
For the nine years preceding the merger
the Bennett co. paid regular divs. averaging
8.1 p.c. p.a. The “News” is reported to be
now losing between £BOO and £lOOO a week.
Chief advantages claimed by the board for
its decision are that the circulation and
advertising revenue of the “Sun” will benefit
when the “News” shuts. down. This will
involve the Bennett co. in a run of losses
estimated at £37,800 for the first year of
suspension, £17,350 for the second, and lesser
amounts subsequently. The figures are sub-
ject to minor adjustments, including any
profit that may be earned by the “Woman’s
Budget.” The £37,800 is made up of in-
terest on overdraft, rates, taxes and amounts
payable in respect of staff agreements, but
does not include any allowance for depre-
ciation of the idle plant, says E. G. Knox,
managing editor of the “News.” The cur-
tain has been kept drawn over S. Bennett’s
figures, making it impossible to say hoVr
the finances stand at the moment.
Three proposals were received to (1) lease
the undertaking, with a right to purchase,
or (2) enter into a partnership and continue
publication, but nothing came of them. The
adoption of any of these proposals
have meant competition with the “Sun,”
which the board may have desired to avoid.
Other courses considered and rejected were
the demerging of S. Bennett, Ltd., and publi-
cation of the “News” in a condensed form.
Associated, having extinguished the “Daily
Guardian” and “Telegraph Pictorial,” is now
left with its holding in Sun Newspapers—
-969,692 ords. —as its chief earning asset. Of
course, there are the “Sunday Guardian”
and the newly-launched “Daily Telegraph,”
but it is doubtful if the profits from one
offset the losses of the other. Paid capital
is £3.577,000 in 1,483,999 7 p.c. cum. prefs.
and 2,093,001 ords., mostly represented by
intangibles. The “Sun” co. netted £185,574
for the 12 months to March 31, 1930, or
enough to pay Associated’s pref. div. and
then show 3.9 p.c. on that co.’s ord. capital
as it now stands. But advertising, revenue
has since slumped heavily, and increased
primage and other taxation and the price of
exchange have swelled outgoings.
The market sums up the position by pay-
ing Bs. 6d. fo’r the prefs., and speculates
in the ords. around. 2s. 6d. A readjustment
of capital is inevitable, of course. The
obstacle in the way of the ords. is the big
wad of prefs., which includes 400,000 shares
issued in connection with the purchase of
the goodwill of the “Guardians.”
Amongst recent modest mining ventures
in N.S.W. is the Sterling, with a nominal
capital of £5OOO. Shares are £1 each;
3000 are offered at 2s. each application
and allotment, and the balance in 2s. calls.
The other 2000 shares are reserved for the
vendors of the mining rights to some 50
acres near Wagonga on the South Coast, anu
cash will be paid for them on allotment.
It is a reefing proposition. The three lodes
on which preliminary development work has
been done consist of decomposed felsite. This
is soft and cheap to work, and since the
c pen-cut system can be applied it is expected
that 3s. per ton will cover the cost of get-
ting the ore to the battery; there are, how-
ever, few things more liable to go wrong in
mining than open-cut estimates of cost.
There are 165,000 tons of ore in sight. A
trial crushing of 10 tons averaged SJdwt.
per ton. Charlie Marr, M.H.R. for Parkes,
is one of the directors. John Butters is
consulting engineer.

The Great Britain Sluicing Co., which
runs a property at Strathbogie (N.S.W.), is
one of the many Australian tin-mining con-
cerns which have been hard hit by falling
metal prices, and has been gloomily con-
sidering putting up the shutters. The report
for the half-year ending October 25 last
shows a loss of £2lB, and, with a debit
balance of £664 brought forward, there is
now £SB2 on the wrong side of p. and 1.
account, but there are reserves of £4276.
Production for the half-year was 16 tons
2cwt. of ore, which realised £BB 11s. per ton.
For the previous six months the average
price was £ll3 7s. 3d. Paid capital is only
£5OOO in 10s. shares, and two years ago the
mine could afford to pay 3s. a share in divi-
dends. Shareholders, after pondering on the
question of liquidation, decided to carry on
for the present on the chance of tin prices
improving as a result of the restriction of-
output scheme overseas.
Creditors amounted to £l6O at October 25.
Cash and investments, etc., almost covered
paid capital at £4754. Stores were in at
£450, and mine, plant, etc., figured at £3350.

“Old Warden” : One of the best of Queens-
land’s far northern goldfields is the Etheridge,
near Georgetown. The Etheridge shows were
gradually abandoned when water level was
reached, and to-day the field is practically
deserted. With the coming in of the water,
refractory ores intruded, and this contributed
to the washout. The deepest mine on the
field is the Cumberland, which was worked
800 ft. on the vertical and 1100 ft. on the
underlie. This mine, English owned, paid
good divs. until abandoned in 1900. It is
as well to remember that the great goldfield
of Charters Towers came near to sharing the
fate of the Etheridge. When the workings
reached water level the then dreaded mundie
stone, which was later to return such amaz-
ing yields, appeared. The so-called “brown
stone,” holding free gold and easily worked,
gave way to this most unlikely looking ore,
and the end of the field was freely forecast.
However, the Towers pioneers went on sink-
ing. Pfeiffer and his mates cut the Day
Dawn reef, and the discovery of the Bril-
liant quickly followed. The refractory ore
proved amenable to improved metallurgical
treatment, and the Towers entered on a long
and prosperous life.

Toiling on the 300 ft. level main-haulage
drift at Mt. Isa (Q.), three crews of 10 men
each, working three shifts, recently advanced
469 ft. in a month, after losing 76J hours.
This is claimed to be a new drifting record
for Australia. The crews comprised young
Queenslanders, operating on contract, many of
whom had never w'orked underground before.
It is energy like this which Australia needs
to lift it out of the rut.

The Blenheim Oil Well Reclamation Co.,
of New Plymouth (M.L.), which has been
boring for oil at Moturoa, in the same
locality, for some years, has struck gas fre-
quently and oil occasionally. Towards the
end of January a gush of oil 180 feet high
came through one of the bores, and 1,500,000
gallons have been taken from it. None of
the bores has yet encountered the basaltic
strata that bottom the field, and a London
expert and Prof. Parker, of Otago Uni.,
have given such a favorable view of the
possibilities of the undertaking that an Aus-
tralian syndicate, whose representative talks
of the flotation of cos. with an aggregate
capital of £3,000,000, has been in treaty
with the Blenheim Co. for the purchase of
its lands, rights and plant on a part-cash,
part-share basis.

At Kimberley Options, Edjudina (W.A.),
the level 100 ft. below the lake floor is open-
ing up well, an average of over 2oz. being
maintained. The width of the lode is only
2ft., but 2ft. of 2oz. stuff is better than
4ft. of loz. The main lens of ore is com-
paratively short; still, hopes are high con-
cerning the chance of an enrichment at
depth’. Results from the treatment of trial
parcels of ore are reported satisfactory.
* * * *
During Dec. and Jan. Lake View and Star
treated 12,855 tons of ore for £30,324 worth
of bullion, which yielded a net profit of
£7BBB. In addition 11,321 tons of tributors’
ore were dealt with, but no 'bullion results
are shown for this. The co. also spent
£22,869 on new plant and development dur-
ing the same period. *
At Menzies (W.A.) a young girl recently
specked a small piece of smelted gold in
what was once an assay and smelting shack.
Presently the female inhabitants of the town
(about 20 in all) rushed to the spot and
picked up between them about £lO worth of
bullion. Menzies, which once turned out a
lot of gold, is only a shell of its former self.
Its best mine was the Perth-owned Lady
Shenton, which produced three-quarters of a
million worth of bullion and paid £250,000 in
divs. Shallow-seated enrichments settled
the field.
* ❖ * *
Australian holders of tin stocks felt a
little more cheerful when the spot price
of metal suddenly jumped nearly £6, reach-
ing £122 16s. 6d. The lowest price for many
years was touched in mid-December, when
the figure for prompt supply was £lO4 11s.
3d. How far the rise is due to the restric-
tion scheme is hard to say. In the aggre-
gate the reduction of output agreed upon is
about 22 p.c. of the world’s production in
1929. That is to say, producers are to be
permitted to sell or export ore for the cur-
rent year up to 78 p.c. of their 1929 output.
They are to be grouped into two classes,
A and B. The A class will be obliged to
sell their ore only to A-class buyers; all
B, or small producers, will be obliged to sell
their ore to B-class buyers. The above pro-
visions, and others bearing on them, will
apply in all countries which have agreed to
come into the scheme.

The L. and N. group, which at one time
promised to make millions for itself and tens
of millions for Australia by distilling fuel
oil from coal, black or brown, has crashed
in London.

Many men who have gone prospecting
because hard times have shut down the old
avenues of employment know little, if any-
thing, about the first principles of mining.
To these “Prospecting for Gold, from the
Dish to the Hydraulic Plant,” by lon L.
Idriess (Angus and Robertson, Sydney), is
certain to prove helpful. The author, an
alluvial miner since childhood, is an old
Bulletin contributor. The book contains
illustrations of mining apparatus, with in-
structions how to make them, and there are
ground plans showing how to work claims
of all descriptions.

QUESTIONS ANSWERED.
(Transferred from Service Department.)
I am past middle-age now and have saved,
about two thousand pounds. Where can I
turn for safety at home or abroad? —2008.
You will have to take some risks any-
where. If you send your money out of the
country, you will lose one-third of it; and
if it is already invested you will probably
have to sacrifice a good deal in selling the
securities. If you keep it here you can (1)
put it on deposit, (2) invest in Government
loans, (3) invest in industrials, (4) invest
in other of the sounder stocks. (5) Or in
land. (1) As to bank deposits, inflation
would rob the depositor in common with
other creditors. If there is no currency infla-
tion there is a possibility of prices of securi-
ties falling and keeping so low that certain
hanks may not be able to pay all their credi-
tors. This does not seem a large risk at
present. (2) As to public stocks, inflation
would rob the bondholder. Whether there is
to be inflation depends on the people. (3)
Industrials did best, on the whole, of all
stock and share groups in the German infla-
tion ; some industrial concerns made fortunes.
(This was because, imports being for all
practical purposes barred, monopoly prices
were demanded, and huge profits were made
on small turnovers.) (4) Trading concerns
like Burns Philp, without any large amount
of more or less fixed debt owing to them, will
probably show large recoveries. But care
must be taken in the selection. Thus it is
quite possible that some cos. will suffer in
the country’s struggle to reduce the cost of
living—the sugar and gas cos., for example.
And cos. which have large _ investments in
mortgages and public securities are to be
viewed with suspicion till the clouds clear.
(5) The German farmer lost little and some-
times gained much. But non-productive
land can be a heavy burden.
(1) Who holds the gold in Australia?
(2) Does the gold reserve carry a super-
structure of notes and credit? (3) In rela-
tion to gold reserves and note issue, etc.,
■what teas our position respectively in 1914
and 1930?—1992.
(1) and (2) The gold reserve against
notes is held by the Note Issue Department
of the Commonwealth Bank: the reserve
must equal 25 p.c. of the issue. A small
quantity of gold is held by trading banks ;
they had £2,901,739 of coin on Dec. 31 and
£22,078,849 a year earlier. The balance
was commandeered for shipment to London.
The banks now hold notes instead of gold.
There is also the gold in ornaments, etc. —
quantity unknown. The present ratio of
gold in the Note Issue Department to notes
is 30.70 p.c. A year ago it was 56.30 p.c.
(3) Early in 1915 the notes were 32 mil-
lions, the gold reserve 11 millions, or 34 p.c.
Advances by the banks of the Common-
wealth in 1914 were 117 millions; at the end
of 1930, 294 millions.
The six months’ revenue of N. S. Wales
was 24 millions, and 8 millions was wanted
for interest. How is it possible for a busi-
ness to pay 33J p.c. of its gross turnover in
interest. Is this not what Mr. Lang says/
—1935.
If Mr. Lang says this he is very ignorant.
Britain, upon which Mr. Lang wants us to
loaf, had a total revenue of 836 millions
in 1928-29, of which it paid 369 millions,
or 44 p.c., in interest and sinking fund. And
then there was 18 millions over. Of France s
revenue of 45,430 million francs in 19— J
25,226 million francs were wanted for in-
terest and debt charges—that is, 55 p.c.
How can a ncwchum tell whether a film
on water is an indication of petroleum or
whether it results from the presenceof iron,
decaying vegetable matter, etc. f—1763.
Water containing iron in solution is liable
to show a slight iridescence on the surface,
which is frequently mistaken for oil. In
marshy districts an oil film may result from
the decay of vegetable matter near the sur-
face. And water in the vicinity of factories
in which oil is used, or which is used by
motor-boats, can easily become contaminated.
Usually substances which leave films on
water can be distinguished from oil-
films by their brittleness. When struck they
break up into patches having irregular edges,
and have little tendency to come together
again. An oil film, similarly struck, will
generally resist being broken, and when it
does separate into patches these will have
smooth edges and tend to close up again.
In case of doubt skim off sufficient film (with
a spoon or similar article, not. with blotting-
paper) to nearly fill a half-gallon bottle,
excluding carefully any silt or decomposing
vegetable matter. The bottle used should
be quite clean, and if a cork is used it should
be a new one. Send to the N.S.W. Mines
Department with full particulars of the cir-
cumstances.
(1) Present value of scheelite? (2) Is
there a market for it in Sydney? (3) Does
it occur in regular lodes, or in lenticular
deposits? —1760.
(1) Scheelite is quoted in London at 14s.
to 14s. 6d. per unit for 65 per cent, ore or
145 10s. to £47 2s. 6d. per ton. (2) Firms m
Sydney are prepared to purchase. (3) It
usually occurs in irregular pockets, bunches
or lenticular deposits.
How is our trade with the V.S.A.; is there
not a big leak there?\ —l372.
Total imports of U.S. origin in the last
normal year (to June, ’29) were £35,305,345 ;
total exports, £5,831,794. The “leak” has
since been largely stopped. U.S.A. imports
in the current year are not expected to be
more than one-third of even the previous
year’s. Thus in five months the total value
of certain imports to Australia from all
countries has fallen as follows: —
June-Nov., June-Nov.
1929. 1930.
Petrol spirit . . . . .. £3,169,750 £1,926,253
Motor vehicles (inc. bodies) 4,095,026 766,108
Rubber goods .. .. •• 1,007,992
Timber • • 1,460,180 878,613
These are the lines of which the U.S.A.
was the heaviest exporter to us.
BRIEF ANSWERS.
XOX: You would get so little now
that you had better see the gamble l through, especi-
ally as there is no liability on the shares W.C.:
Backing is good and interest seems sure. They
will be among the early ones to recover... .A.A.A.:
You can do better... .Spero: Ditto... .8.C.: Looks
quite right H.M.: Such a narrow seam of
asbestos in serpentine would not be a commercial
proposition. No market for serpentine in its ordinary
massive form.... J.D.: (1) and (2) No part of The
Bulletin is owned outside Australia; more than
three-fourths of it is owned by people who work at
producing it and the other fourth by dependants
of former toilers. (3) and (5) Total Australian
production of gold to end of ’2B was 627 millions;
less than 50 millions has been retained for currency
and ornament. Total Government debt of Australia
to June, ’3O, was 1100 millions, of which 574
millions are repayable overseas. (4) No record.
(6) Don’t see any way of collecting it....T.W.:
(1) £l3O in Australia is worth £lOO in Canada.
(2) £lOO in Australia would be worth a shade
under £77. But the . N.Z.-Canadian rate is much
more favorable. . . .G.W.8.: Your age makes advice
difficult. If the premiums are not a burden, perhaps
better pay. .. .P.Y.T.: Cash value of bonuses depends
on (1) your age; (2) how long the policy has to
run. On a whole-life policy, each £lOO of rever-
sionary bonuses would be worth about £45 at age
54. On a policy payable at 60 the same bonuses
would be worth about £75.


THE AUSTRALIAN GRAZIERS’ MEAT. COMPANY, LIMITED,
First Floor, 16 Barrack Street, Sydney, will its definite
objective of State-wide Co-operative Country Killing
HANDS OFF PRIMARY PRODUCTS —
ACTION NOT WORDS
If our economic structure is to stand and “New South Wales is to again secure a
place in the sun” the full profit from Primary Industry must be the right of the
Producer. Every sound-thinking business man will assist the man on the land in
introducing this reform, because he recognises in it THE FIRST PRACTICAL STEP
TO NATIONAL PROSPERITY.
STATE WIDE CO-OPERATIVE COUNTRY KILLING MEANS
(1) The total profits from the Meat Industry being preserved to THE PRODUCER.
(2) Much healthier and much cheaper meat to THE CONSUMER.
(3} Retrieving a Profitable Meat Export Market for AUSTRALIA.
UNITED WE STAND—DIVIDED WE FALL
Graziers must recognise the magnitude of the task—they know full well its import-
ance to the Grazing Industry. They must also realise that A FEW CANNOT
SUCCEED. Every Grazier must do his part. Vested Interests are relying on past
experience “that Graziers have never united to protect themselves.” They fail
to realise the impetus of THE LAW OF SELF-PRESERVATION.

Melba.
When it comes down to fundamentals there
are three essentials of success in any enter-
prise;—brains, enthusiasm and concentration.
Nellie Melba rose to be the most famous
singer in the world because she possessed
these qualities in excelsis. Of course there
was the Voice, a natural voice of the most
delicious lightness and quality, a voice used
with the most consummate artistry, a voice
that was preeminent in Covent Garden for a
quarter of a century. Still, I have no diffi-
dence in asserting that the Voice was one of
the smaller gifts in Melba’s possession.
I remember a dress rehearsal of “Caval-
leria .Rusticana” with Melba in charge. The
orchestra and singers were a motley crew
of Italians, French and Middle Europeans.
The Dame spoke to all in their oWn lan-
guages and told them how she wanted every-
thing done. Then there came the prayer
scene in front of the church. The chorus
was kneeling, but not the way the Dame
wanted them to. So she went round in-
dividually to every member and either knelt
for them or pushed them into the position.
The rehearsal was interminable; but when
it was over everyone knew a great deal more
than at the beginning. Then Dame Nellie
-went somewhere else and did something else
she was down for, in spite of the fact that
she had just had four hours of the keenest
concentration. She had a passion for accu-
racy, and work was her delight. I never
heard her sing a wrong note. I suppose she
must have done it, but I never heard of any-
one else pointing it out. When she studied a
soing or an aria, she finally decided what was
the perfect way of presenting it. She left
it at that, and if you heard her sing the
same thing 20 years afterwards she pro-
bably did it in exactly the same way, unless
she had worked out a better one in the mean-
time. Because she sang exactly what was
written, and effaced her own personality in
the music, people said she was cold. No one
ever heard her buying cheap applause by
finishing off on the high note that the com-
poser hadn’t written. She was never spec-
tacular, musically, and would have been
hopeless in vaudeville. She never sang down
to the crowd, and so the crowd never really
loved her. They respected her, they were awed
by her, they knew she was perfection in
her art.... but they never worshipped her.
In one way, it was a pity, because anyone
who knew Melba knew that her Australian
sentiment was a living, pulsating passion
with her.
Because she lingered a little long on a
stage that never knew quite her equal, the
press was unkind. I heard her here
three years ago, and she could still sing the
head off anyone in Australia. And any
teacher or singer with the intelligence to
learn must have learnt much from that sing-
ing. Not the least reason of her musical
excellence was that she was a musician first
and a singer afterwards. She was trained
as a pianist before she thought of making
a living as a singer. Would to God that 90
per cent, of our singers would follow her
example!
To the younger generation Melba was a
legend. That is rather a pity, because, in
my opinion, she was the greatest woman
Australia has yet produced. And for the
moment I can’t think of any of our men who
have equalled her importance and power
overseas.

One thing that many may have felt was
missing from Melba’s burial service and the
subsequent ceremonies at Lilydale was the
artistic tribute. It is true that there were
wreaths from musical and artistic organisa-
tions, _ and that leading conductors and
musicians were in the congregation. But
that was the only part they had in the com-
memoration. Numbers from what one
churchman has described as “our melan-
choly hymnal” were sung, but their mono-
tonous cadences were not calculated to con-
jure up the image of the quick and eager
spirit who was Melba. Nor was the Right
Rev. Dr. Borland able to rise to the occa-
sion in his oration and make his hearers
recall an art that was instinct with the
spirit of joy, gaiety, beauty and passion.
And so the ceremony proceeded to the final
exit. Had, say, the Dead March from
Beethoven’s Third Symphony followed the
footsteps of the pall-bearers an artist would
have spoken to an artist in the words of
art’s true philosophy. For in that noble
piece of music the bald physical fact of
death is dismissed as of no importance. What
docs it matter when an artist dies if she
lias discharged her mission as fully and
gloriously as Melba?
The sort of service one would have liked to
see would have included an address by a
fellow-artist, such as Fritz Hart—one who
understood the nature of his theme artisti-
cally, with every fibre of his being, as no
churchman and few laymen could ever under-
stand it. It would also have included gramo-
phone-records of the singer in her greatest
moments—as Desdemona waiting in prayer-
ful resignation for the coining of the mur-
derous Othello ; as Marguerite ; as Mimi;
as Rosina in “The Barber of Seville”; as
Gilda in “Itigoletto,” and as Juliette. The
Scots’ Church organ was not the instrument
to usher Melba through the heavenly por-
tals. What was needed was the full harmony
of a symphony orchestra, the crisp music
of a fiddle played by a master hand like
Tarzcynski’s, or the clear, ringing tones of a
piano .responding to the touch of Edward
Gull’s fingers.
At Lilydale the coffin was transferred to
a gun-carriage. What had that symbol of
destruction to do with the final obsequies
of a great creative artist?
“Pawang” : Melba was said some years ago
to have bequeathed her throat to 1 Melbourne
University for scientific purposes. It has
always been understood that the organ had
been peculiarly endowed by Nature for the
uses its owner put it to, so effortless was
her singing. One can imagine the learned
professors measuring it and reducing to a
formula the magic which made audiences all
over the world weep at the demise of Mimi.
But they will not solve the secret. They
might find a thousand persons with throats
exactly corresponding to the formula, and
the whole thousand combined might not
make a Melba. How much intelligence had
to do with Melba’s greatness as a singer was
well illustrated at her final appearance in
grand opera, which was in Melbourne in
September, 1928. Said The Bulletin on
that occasion:—
Of the Voice there was little; but the whole
performance was a triumph of mind over matter,
and the simple realistic tragedy of Mimi’s death
once more penetrated to the bosom of an audience.
Eater in the afternoon she appeared as Des-
demona, and nobody felt anything incongru-
ous in the spectacle of that aged woman
taking the part of one of Shakspeare’s
youngest heroines.
* * *
“Cauboy”: Melba’s voice was ever ready
in the cause of charity. She raised £60,000
for the Red Cross alone during Armageddon.
The limbless soldiers will never forget what
she did for them. Lilydale shire also rejoices
in many social amenities provided by its most
illustrious ratepayer. Perhaps her kindest
action was her offer to sing at Melbourne
Auditorium with violinist Zimbalist, whose
season was failing owing to his following on a
long train of visiting virtuosi. The announce-
ment packed the building, and the resultant
show was gloriously entertaining, if not
particularly artistic. Melba sang to Zimbal-
ist’s playing, and he fiddled to her playing.
Then they both sang “Home, Sweet Home,”
while she pounded the ivories. Finally he
kissed her hand and she kissed him on the
forehead, while the crowd yelled its approval.
Subsequent audiences continued to fall off,
however, though the Dame resolutely attended
and spurred the fiddler on with her Bravas.
“Props”: I have in one of my scrapbooks
an account of Melba’s debut in “Lucia di
Lammermoor” at iCovent Garden in 188 S,
sent by the London rep. of the New’ Zealand
Press Assoc, to the various dailies in Maori-
land :
If Mdlle. Melba’s friends imagined she was going
to score a triumph straight off, they were mistaken.
Their injudiciously prolonged applause upon the
young lady’s entry irritated the house, which froze
as only a Oovent Garden opera audience c&n. For-
tunately the Edgardo was a great artist, with one
of the most exquisite tenor voices I ever heard.
Moreover he (Signor Ravelli) can act, and his act-
ing gave confidence to Melba. They sang the favorite
duet which closes the first act grandly, and were
enthusiastically applauded. When, however, recalled
before the curtain, it became clear that the cheers
were pointed rather at Ravelli than the debutante.
To her the house was polite and coldly admiring,
certainly not enthusiastic. Later Melba sang much
better and even secured an encore, but the applause
at the end lacked vigor. The critics next morning
were cautious; they would not decide for or against
Melba on one performance. My own notion is that
she will rank with Nordica or Ella Russell [artists,
by the way, who toured Aussie in this century],
but certainly not (as Gus Harris seemed to think)
with such as Jenny Lind or Patti.
But Harris was right, and the pressman, like
his fellow-scribes in Australia, did not know
the genuine article when he heard it.
Adelaide has resumed its function of being
the trying-out ground for the Firm’s produc-
tions. The G. and S. organisation will open
there for a fortnight before submitting to
Melbourne’s judgment, as did the last co.
Nat Phillips and his bright revue crowd
have now been in occupation of Sydney
Opera House for four months or so. They
look like continuing. Theirs is the reward
of hard and honest toil. Nat in the show
turns himself into a hobby-horse for the
rest to ride on, but does it smiling night
after night. He is an uncommonly good
leader. There is none of the take-it-easy and
damn-the-audience attitude of a few years
ago. Two of Nat’s lieutenants, Sid Beck
and Joe Lawman, can be held up as inter-
esting examples; both do work fifty
per cent, better than they did for Hugh D.
Mclntosh at the St. James last year. There
are one or two fair voices in the troupe.
Dirt is amazingly absent from the laugh-
fetching stuff.
* * *
“Viennese Nights,” at Sydney Playbox,
appears to be interesting more as a study
of one Schnitzler than for anything else.
Probably only a Continental mind could
have conceived such a situation as that pre-
sented in its second act, wherein a chap in
whose arms, according to himself, some dozen
or two women have lain brings to his friend’s
flat the mementoes of his affairs —letters,
curls and what not —and has the friend open
the package and go over the contents with
him. It is a situation without universality.
Perhaps it could be done in Vienna without
being basically absurd. Transported to an
alien shore, and translated by actors in
whose lives it could not possibly occur, it
is farcical. Naturally, its actors, Duncan
Maedougall and Edward Howell the main
ones, seemed to be all hands and mouths and
sac suits and feet. They tried hard to create
the illusion that they were feeling thoroughly
at home, and deserve credit for the mildness
and restraint of their attack. But though
the spirit was eager enough, the flesh re-

at ease in a Viennese flat, but actors being
clumsy in a Sydney basement. No fault of
theirs. Blame Schnitzler.*

“Husbands Are a Problem,” a mild and
English, comedy by Harris Deans, was the
Proscenium Club’s first offering of the year
at the Kelvin Hall. Melbourne. The theme
of the divorced husband, who after 20 years
returns like an iron filing to the magnet of
his ex-wife’s maturer charms, seemed so fami-
liar that The Bulletin could have sworn
it had seen the play before, although it was
a first production. The new version had
the advantage of a breezy piece of character-
drawing in the husband, who has rubbed
shoulders with Australia and presumably
benefited by the contact. He was admirably
done by A. Danvers Walker, who', inciden-
tally, writes plays on his own account. His
daughter’s delight at finding her father is a
human being instead of a symbol of immor-
ality was excellently conveyed by Violet
Burns. Dulcie Deed was her competent
mother. The rest of the cast, comprising
Ella Denning, J. S. Simmo’ns, D. C. Reid
and John Ormiston, tended to act in the way
usually affected by amateurs —that is to say.
if they behaved in the same way in actual
life they would be mistaken for raving
maniacs. Stage conventions are very easily
accepted, however, and a full house received
the performance with approval.
The Melbourne public astonished the Firm
by rolling up in force to see the brilliant
Ethel Morrison and her equally expert crew
in “The First Mrs. Fraser.” Thereupon
George Tallis was heard in the press to the
effect that he and his co-directors were so
gratified at this unexpected evidence of adult
intelligence in a populace hitherto regarded
by them as of the mental age of 12 that they
would pursue a policy of continuing to give
the fine cast of actors intelligent pieces. No
doubt even the actors jumped with joy at
hearing this, since it is not to be supposed
that men like J. B. Rowe really enjoy appear-
ing as half-wits in the sort of moronic rub-
bish the Firm usually favors. If so, their
pleasure was short-lived. Word came down
from the box-office that the next piece was to
be Barrie’s “Mary Rose.” This botched spasm
of Barrie’s innate sentimentalism was not a
conspicuous success even under Boucicault’s
direction and with a cast specially garnered
in England. Only a theatrical miracle could
have made it so with Miss Morrison's people.
Yet there are a dozen other plays that would
fit this excellent company like a glove—
“ Passing Brompton-road,” for instance. ■

“Say Bo” : Announcement of disbandment
of Vic. Prof. Orchestra (B. 18/2/’3l) is
premature. The organisation, which was
reborn in a lane off the King’s Theatre when
conductor Slapo'ffski accidentally walked into
a musicians’ discussion, has sympathisers who
have offered to back it for a few more weeks,
at any rate. It has also been suggested
that some of the relief money which goes
to keep the unemployed idle might be
diverted to this hard-battling group _of 42
highly competent performers. By their own
unaided efforts they have raised £3SOO since
1929, £5OO of which has gone to pay double
rates to unionist attendants at the Sunday
concerts while brilliant violinists like Tar-
czynski sometimes did not earn their tram-
fares. Among projects mooted is a perform-
ance of Alfred Hill’s Maori opera “Teora,”
with the composer conducting.
The Palette,
“F.S.”: Sculptor Epstein has done it
again. He has exhibited a gargantuan
marble entitled “Genesis” at the Leicester
Galleries. One critic declared the opus as
unfit for exhibition, several newspapers re-
produced photos of the head only, declaring
the rest unsuitable for the perusal of their
readers, and the Australian cableman was
too shocked even to describe the sinful object.
“Cine Ma”: One result of the Gallery con-
troversy in Melbourne is that crowds of
people have been filing past Mclnnes’s pic-
ture of Nellie Stewart and knitting their
brows over the problem of why director
Hall prefers a potboiler to Meldrum’s
brilliant study of a Breton peasant. This
is not the first time that Nellie’s counterfeit
presentment has caused a national furore.
In 1911 Spencer made a moving-picture ot
“Sweet Nell” and it was released during the
Christmas season at the Lyceum, Sydney.
When the nation’s sweetheart sailed in her
famous cartwheel-hat down an avenue of
Australian gum-trees and offered an orange
to the audience, the roof nearly came off
the ancient theatre. The pursuit of Fair-
fax, the villainous Jeffreys’s descent on Miss
Gwynn’s house and other incidents were
shown amongst genuine and recognisable
Sydney surroundings. In the final fadeout,
Nell fled from the amorous Charles through
a harborside garden, leaving him to comfort
himself with a brace of spaniels. One critic
announced that at last “Sweet Nell had
been immortalised in imperishable fashion.”
but where is the disc of celluloid to-day ?
No doubt, in the limbo of forgotten things,
where Mclnnes’s painting will in due course
join it.
“F.S.”: New York came to precisely the
same conclusion about the recent exhibition
of Australian pictures as London did about
the Australian show of seven years ago in
the Great Smoke. Said the critic of the
“N.Y. Times”: “Judging from the pictures
shown Australian artists are simply follow-
ing Continental and British leads.” The
art of painters of the official school, such as
Streeton, Mclnnes, Blamire Young _ and
scores of others, attractive as some of it is,
can all ultimately be traced back to one
Royal Academician or another. Our futur-
ists, like Shore, Frater and Lawler, are
faithful carbon copies of Cezanne and other
“modernists” of 40 or so years ago. I
venture to assert that if Clarice Beckett,
Justus Jorgensen and Colin Colahan, of the
despised Meldrum school, had submitted some
of their works, the N’York verdict might
have been different. The basis of Meldrum’s
doctrine was that Nature should teach the
artist how to paint. To men who had
spent their lives trying to make Australian
skies look like the skies of Leader, and Aus-
tralian gum-trees look like English oaks, this
was the rankest heresy. None of the Mel-
drum school submitted canvases, however:
they had had bitter experience of local selec-
tion committees before. Incidentally, the
only pictures in the Australian show in Lon-
don on which the critics animadverted
approvingly were one by Percy Leason and
one by Meldrum. The rest struck them as
merely a case of bringing coals to Newcastle.


LETTING DOWN THE DEAD.

THE SOAP-BOX
Nothing promises better for this country’s future than the eagerness with which
suggestions and policies are discussed by correspondents. Many of the most welcome
raise objections to “Bulletin” propositions or seek further information. These are
dealt with in articles where possible, or in answers given through the Service
Department. A few others call for attention here.
Whereas we buy from other countries at
prices based' on production costs, we sell our
stuff for whatever the buyers offer. Would
there by anything disloyal or revolutionary
in requiring our overseas creditors, from
whom we have bought so much, to cut out
a fair share of our debt by taking so much
of our goods as they require at prices based
on our production costs?— J. W., Mary-
borough (Q )

nobody buys any?Mng except from best

that somebody shall buy from us for so much
in return for our buying from him at so
much is quite a proper thing. To buy from
him without any such arrangement, and con-
sume his goods, and then notify him that we
shall pay him at a price that we fix our-
selves, is not so much “disloyal and revolu-
tionary” as plain dishonest. One of the
first bills of which the Labor party approved,
by the way, was for tightening up the Truck
Act, making it an offence to pay any man
his wages or any part of them in goods.
m -r. . , , ~ j
Tiie Bulletin supports deflation and says
wage-reducUon is necessary How will this
-ZZZTZZZI J V iLtZiTi y
efit investor s. W. P. P., Unley .).
First, let’s cut out that word deflation.
Nobody knows exactly what it means. If,
however, is meant reduction of prices, The
Bulletin supports it just as much as it sup-
ports to-morrow’s sunrise. If the world
lasts it has got to happen. Or, rather, it
has happened. The “Economist” Price-index
numbers are based on the average for 1927;
that is 100. By Dec., 1928, they were down
to 95 • by Dec 1929 they were 88 • Dec.,
’3o,' 68- Jan. 1931 ""66. We’ve got to keep
pace with that “deflation” elsewhere or we
can’t sell our goods; and if we can’t sell
our goods we can’t either buy necessaries
abroad or pay our interest bill. Apart from
that, reduction of wages does not matter to
the wage-earner one straw provided all costs
come down correspondingly. As for the man
with fixed income benefiting, no doubt he
does, just as for years past the community
benefited at the expense of the man with the
fixed-income. Somebody always is benefiting.
The community might reasonably ask the
creditor for a re-arrangement; but he cannot
go beyond that.
And when all is said and done, can you
get away from the fact that equality of sac-
rifl.ee is called for; and' how can you reconcile
the untouched bondholder’s position with
that cardinal principle?— F. 1,. G., Ipswich
(Q.).
But isn’t it possible that some people have
already made their sacrifice? Here’s a
working man, a bricklayer, who says that.
having saved up £7OO and being offered a
first-class mortgage carrying 7 p.c., he decided
to take no risks whatever and put the money
into a Commonwealth loan at 5 p.c. He has
made his sacrifice—some of it, at any rate —
year after year. The Bulletin repeats that
it might be a good thing to invite the bond-
holders to take less interest on condition that
interest moved in future with some agreed-
upon index figure; but if it is even seriously
t h reatened that in its dealings with bond-
holders Australia will play with a two-
headed penny, taking advantage of a fall but
refusing the bondholder the benefit of a rise,
future loans (including renewals) are going
to be mighty expensive.
The evidence that our producers are getting
at least some benefit out of the exchange pre-
mium is overwhelming. _ Now, if the . com-
munity was paying this premium, prices
should be going up; bxit they are actually
coming down. * If the cost of living is not
going up, why not continue to pay producers
this subsidy? —M. F. 8., Bathurst (N.S.W.).
No doubt producers have gained and are
gaining by the exchange premium. This pre-
mium is paid (1) by the taxpayers who have
to provide interest in London; (2) by all
others who have to make payments abroad.
The export industries are thus getting a
subsidy of anything up to 30 p.c. contributed
mainly by other industries but partly by
the export industries themselves. The pre-
mium has the same effect as a 30 p.c. customs
duty; but as it bears equally on goods w r hicn
can be and which cannot be produced m
Australia, it is in no sense protective. On
the contrary, by imposing heavy charges on
raw materials, it is a burden on Australian
industry. The ultimate reply of the importer
and manufacturer will, of course, be to put
up the price of their goods (many of them
have done it already) ; and this in process
of' time will neutralise the export producer’s
advantage. But until prices have thus re-
arranged themselves, the export producer will
certainly gain—at the expense of the rest of
the community.
You say that capital is making sacrifices
commensurate with those you seek to impose
on us [ workers]; yet banks are paying
9 and 10 per cent, on investments which
have the same freedom from risk as Govern-
ment stock. — Worker, Camooweal (Q.).
No, bank shares have not “the same free-
dom from risk as Government stock.” In
1892-93 almost every Australian bank had to
reconstruct; in several cases not only was all
the paid capital lost, but the uncalled capital
had to be called up and then written off.
Take the Queensland National for an
example (this inquirer is a Queenslander).
First, the £5 paid shares were written down
to £3. Then £3 per share was called up from
shareholders. Next £3 w r as written off shares.
And no dividend was paid for over 20 years.
The mere fact that some banks have been
paying 10 p.c. lately doesn’t prove that they
are thriving. In 1592, a few weeks before it
smashed most disastrously, one of the big-
gest of them in Melbourne paid a div. at the
rate of 121 per cent.
Heavy taxation is bringing in but little, as
the people have little income to tax. There
is, hon ever, an abundance of goods in the
State, so why not impose a tax in terms of
goods, and discharge with the proceeds our
various liabilities within the State? That
would leave the cash in hand available for
meeting outside interest bills. —P. E. S.,
Kogarah (N.S.W.).
Mr. Lang is already practising this scheme
of inflation on a small scale. He is issuing
orders, which butchers and others are honor-
ing ; and when they want to cash them so
that they may pay their own debts they can’t
always do it. That difficulty could be got
over so far as the people of the State are
concerned by making it a penal offence to
refuse to accept the orders at face value. The
immediate result would be that this forced
currency would drive out all other money,
there would he a flight of capital from the
State, with consequent further unemployment.
There would be no standard of value for
the orders: we have already seen how our
£ notes, gold payments having been sus-
pended, have fallen until it takes 130 of
them to buy 100 English £ notes. The new
inflation would inevitably drag the Austra-
lian £ still lower; so, though we would be
compelled to accept a £1 order in payment
of ah old £1 debt, we should probably find
it actually worth a few pence within a few
months. You cannot force currency on a
country and maintain its value. Any forced
currency is therefore merely a scheme by
which the debtor can rob the creditor.
Yow claim that a national emergency exists,
due to our squandermania; I claim that an
international emergency exists due to the
breakdown of international finance follow-
ing the war. if your point of view is to per-
sist, I say that emergency measures should
embrace everyone and not only the worker.
If the workers are to take your deflation lying
down, then we want proof that the sacrifice
is general. To this end I, suggest an emer-
gency super-tax, making the maximum income
from personal exertion £6OO, from properly
£4OO and from personal'exertion and pro-
perty £7OO. —B. H. A., Queensland.
There is no special breakdown of inter-
national finance. The trade cycle lias car-
ried us down into a trough, as it has done
many times. The world’s trade has recovered
before, and there are definite signs that, it
has begun to recover again. Nothing has
happened even in Australia which calls for
a panic or which cannot be cured by the
ordinary commonsense process of cutting our
coat according to our cloth. This corres-
pondent wants “an emergency supertax,” to
limit the income retained by the taxpayer.
The Governments, stupid as some of them
are, know a trick worth two of that. If you
absolutely limit a man’s income you limit a
man’s exertion and encourage him to lock
up his capital; if you let him have a per-
centage of what he produces he will not, as a
rule, limit his exertions or lock up his capi-
tal. So the Governments are not putting a
limit to income but are increasing their tax
exactions. The Commonwealth income tax on
both personal exertion and property ran from
3d. and a fraction to ss. in the £l. In the
past 12 months there have been cumulative
additions of 15 i per cent, on the property
income tax. In N.S.W. the State income
tax, payable oli top of all that, runs
up to ss. in the £l. To that has been
lately added Is. in the £1 unemployment
relief tax payable alike on personal-exertion
and property income. There are a few people
who are escaping sacrifice; but the average
sacrifice among the comparatively well-to-do
—especially the smaller professional men and
investors and traders—is prodigious.
Even allowing that the banks are doing all
they can, would it not be an enormous advan-
tage if banking was nationalised and money
and credit taken out of the hands of private
financial interests? —J. F. D., Woollahra
(N.S.W.).
Fifty years ago we were saying all this
about the railways. How could a country
be properly developed, and how could settlers
hope to get the best out of their land, unless
all railways belonged to the people, and,
instead of being operated for private gain,
were operated for the public good? In theory
it was all admirable and still is. The millions
that would go into the pockets of share-
holders under private enterprise would, we
said, go into the pockets of producers under
public ownership. We know different to-
day. And worse would happen under political
control of banking. We have seen how
for 12 months past the Commonwealth
Bank, purely a people's institution, has had
to fight off the attacks of politicians upon
things which the controllers of the bank
regard as absolutely essential to its safety.
The one and only reason why the ordinary
trading banks are no longer able to support
some of their private customers as they
should is that the Governments have drained
them of every penny they could spare. If
Governments would do that with private
institutions, which are able to offer some
resistance, what would they hot do to
national institutions, incapable necessarily
of offering resistance? And would not the
public be worse off instead of better?
Arc: there any statistics available to shoio
what happened to (1) various industries, and
(2) workers during and after the inflation
in Germany?. —C. K., Largs Bay (S.A.).
Plenty. Professor Moritz Bonn is one
writer on the subject. He wrote (in “The
Effects of Currency Inflation”) : “The wiping-
out of industrial and agricultural debts, to
which must be added the cancellation of
State and municipal debts, has practically
destroyed the purchasing power of the middle
class.” “The class living from the savings
of the past has lost its income; it will have
to be kept alive somehow by the earnings of
the classes who have despoiled it.” “The
cost of running the State and the munici-
palities must [henceforth] be borne by the
producers.” “The wiping out of all debt obli-
gations by the depreciation of money has
destroyed mobile capital not short of 150
milliards Even after stabilisation has
been achieved the rates of interest are bound
to be high from want of capital. When
things were settling down 24 p.c. was quite
a reasonable rate.” “During the period of
inflation wages in Germany have been con-
siderably below wages in countries competing
with her industrially. This was partly due
to the fact that no system can be devised
which can adapt wages to prices immedi-
ately.” “As late as March, 1923, the per-
centage of unemployment was but 5.7 p.c.
of the membership of trade unions; but the
average of short-time workers was 24.2 p.c.,
and in some unions was as high as 66.9 p.c.”
“[After stabilisation] superfluous labor was
dismissed; unemployment on a large scale
was rife; wages were reduced. With five
millions unemployed and a low ebb in the
funds of the trade unions, the working class
could not offer resistance to this lowering
of wages.”
I suppose Theodore, Anstey and co. have
some capital invested. If they are willing
to risk their capital, it is the surest proof
that they believe their scheme to be sound.
This view is fairly gcues'al among workers
with whom I have discussed it. — Geoloin,
Murray’s Creek (Q.).
First, this correspondent “supposes” some-
thing, and then says that what he supposes
is “sure proof”! There is just as good
ground for supposing that Theodore’s money
is well out of the country ; and as for Frank
Anstey—the man who supposes that that lov-
able old sentimentalist has tuppence invested
(outside perhaps his home and a trifle in
the bank) doesn’t know the first thing about
Frank Ailstey.

ABORIGINALITIES
Thirdovaquid” : My uncle Theophilus, who
arrived in Australia about the time the Vic.
gold boom was at its height, but who made
little profit as a miner or as anything else,
told me this strange story of the circum-
stances under which one of his shipmates
came to leave the lights o’ London for these
savage shores. Young- Jones was a bank
clerk and an embezzler. When discovery
■was only a matter of days he was smitten
by remorse—or funk—and decided to seek
the advice of an old and highly-respected
solicitor, an intimate friend o-f his family.
The old gentleman heard him without exhibit-
ing emotion. Where Jones had expected con-
sternation and upbraidings he was met by a
monumental calm. “You have stolen,” said
the man of law incisively, “£750. Now —
I’m not asking this out of idle curiosity—
how much more can you lay yo-ur hands on
to-day?” Jones stammered that if he wanted
to go the whole hog there was £BOOO or £9OOO
A SIMPLE MATTER OF ARITHMETIC.
IkEY: “Vot, you say that house not vorth £450 Vy, you could insure it For £500 and
then you’d have £50 over and the land as veil!”
in his custody. “Go and get the lot,” said
the benevolent-looking old gent., “and bring it
back here to me.” So Jones obeyed his legal
adviser and returned with the swag. “Nine
thousand and .thirty in Bank of England
notes,” announced the solicitor, after count-
ing them. “That’s £3030 for me, £3OOO for
you and £3OOO for the bank. You go back
and destroy the record of the numbers of
those notes, and take passage for Australia.
A ship leaves to-morrow. Leave the rest to
me.” Hence it was that in a few days’ time
the bank received a letter from the highly-
respected solicitor stating that young Jones
had embezzled £9780 and absconded, but that
if there were ho publicity and no prosecution
Jones’s family were prepared to scrape up
£3OOO as partial restoration. The bank took
the money.

“Tabitha”: A lot has . been written on
this page about the courage and fortitude of
Australian humans, but nothing so far has
exceeded_ the record of my fellow-feline Jero-
boam Dickson, ■ of Adelaide. There was a
fire next door and a brick wall fell through
Mr. Dickson’s wall. Jeroboam was under
the floor devotedly and loyally chasing a rat,
and lie was pinned by the tail. For eight
nights and eight days that heroic cat sat
there, starving and in agony, for his tail
was broken. On the evening of the eighth
day someone heard his feeble cry for help,
and he was rescued. Now, with a Manx-
style rudder, he is as brisk and energetic
as ever, and many rats have taken their
families away from Adelaide because of his
renewed activities.

“Ben Digo”: Charlie Hislop, making his
uncertain way home after a wet night in the
mining township of Boolara, was obsessed by
a fear of falling down one of the 20ft. or 30ft.
holes which pitted the district. But suddenly
he arrived safe at his own door. Mr. His-
lop stumbled against the portal of his man-
sion, which, being unlatched, immediately
opened, taking him with a considerable
amount of momentum into the darkened
room. Being unable to check his unexpected
run, he tripped over the old-fashioned fender
and sprawled on his back in the open fire-
place, where he at once dropped off into
sound slumber. Some three hours later,
awakened by intense cold and a few rain-
drops falling on his face, he slowly opened
his eyes., Everything was dark' and
strangely still, and then, to his horror, he
glimpsed a star twinkling down at him
through a small aperture some 20ft. above
his head. “Down a hole," groaned Charlie.
Gingerly standing upright he was relieved to
find that except for an aching head he was
unhurt. For the next half-hour the night
was made horrid by coo-ees and howls for
succor, but at last, convinced of the futility
of asking for help, Charles decided to make
an effort to assist himself. Several hours
later a bedraggled and filthy figure reached
the outer air. Mr. Hislop looked vainly for
some familiar landmark; then, deciding lie
at least knew the general direction of his
destination, he stepped on his way. “Goder-
mity!” he moaned as he lay full length in the
mud at the base of the chimney. “Now I’m
down another one!”
* V $ if
“George Mundy” : Riding across country one
day, I came upon a cow-cocky friend of mine
taking a mob of poddies to the saleyards.
His cattle-dog, elderly and somewhat morose,
but a most capable worker, had entire charge
of the calves, while we rode quietly behind
discoursing of this and that. I also had a
dog with me, but not of the working class—
he belonged to the unemployables. I sup-
pose a man has no business to harbor a dog
like that, but he was such a jolly, friendly
little chap that I couldn’t bear to get
rid of him. He kept.trying to make friends
with Blue, who took no- notice whatever of
him, and in between times made a nuisance
of himself by dashing about, starting up
rabbits, barking at butterflies and generally
doing everything to stir up the calves and
rile the old dog. The climax came when a
magpie swooped as we passed too near its
nest. The pup rushed after it, barking right
among the poddies, splitting the mob and
scattering them in all directions. The old
dog just let them go where they would while
he gave his undivided attention to the young-
ster, who got such a hiding as he had never
imagined in his worst nightmares. When
the lesson was finished and a sore and wiser
pup had limped off home, Blue set to work,
collected the poddies and resumed the jour-
ney with the air of satisfaction proper to one
who has just done a necessary job and done
it well.

And buy the whole place as it stands, lock,-
stock and barrel, rag and clout,
lake squatters do, and do it well,
Walk in—walk out?”
Well, that ideal- strikes us both as fine an’
big an’ worth a fly.
The agent takes his dyin’ oath we’ll both
win out an’ tells us why:
“Leave little things to little men; it’s
triflin’ details turns men grey;
Forget ’em ; you can if you try.
Now what d’ye say?”
Says he to Quinn: “You’ve seen what’s
there; don’t stick at this, or such-
and-such.”
To me he says: “Now fair is fair; just name
a sum—an’ not too much—
To cover everything you’ve got.” An’ then
an’ there straightout I did:
“The whole caboodle, gents, ’ll touch
Nine hundred quid.”
Quinn seems to think that pretty steep, an’
then in sorter afterthought
I adds: “A few things we must keep; things
that at father’s sale we bought.
An’ some that come through Aunt Jane’s
will; to part with them would be a
sin.
There’ll be lots left though—or there ought—
When you walk in.
ANNOUNCEMENTS.
“An’, best of all, Reverend Penhallunack, from Corn’all, will praich ’ere next Looard’s
Day, D.V. An’ if ’e doan’t come then, D.V. or no D.V. ’e can be sartin sure
of un the Sunday followin.’ ”
“An’ there are bits of furnicher, the parlor
chair an’ two best beds,
The missus swears belongs to her; an’ three
young cows, the white an’ reds,
Under a kinder partnership old Peters
claims; there ain’t a doubt
We’ll find him waitin’ at the sheds
When we walk out.”
Here Dave cuts in. This walk-out show
strikes him as bein’ pretty queer.
How ’bout his colt, he’d like to know, that
bull calf an’ the poley steer,
The one he’s brealcin’ in to work, them
springin’ heifers, black an’ brown?
They’re his when he gets spliced nex’ year
An’ settles down.
They’re promised him, I must admit, but
Quinn starts in to cut up rough.
He says: “Oh, don’t mind me a bit; keep
what you want, an’ keep enough
To set the whole dam’ family up ; there’s
plenty left of sorts an’ kind,
Even if it’s cronk an’ broken stuff.
Oh, I don’t mind!
“I s’pose them skim-milk calves is mine? I
mean them weeds that’s off their food;
That glandered horse, I’d like him fine, an’
that small heap of kindlin’ wood;
Likewise that clock, stuck fast for years.
Jus’ suit yerselves when you begin
An’ walk out all that’s any good
When I walk in.”
That gets the wind up Dave an’ me. “You
cheese that monkey gab ; d’ye hear ?”
I says. “You wag yer tongue too free. You
buys or not, an’ get that clear.”
But here Quinn makes straight for the
, door; forgettin’, too, his turn to shout.
Walk in?” he says; “No blanky fear!
Watch me walk out!”

“Jack Point”: It is nearly the end of
the summer, and thus far I haven’t ■heard
the cursed buzz of a single mosquito; . and
I live in Brisbane. Oh, blissful immunity !
I remember sleepless nights—hot humid
nights without breeze—when the little
devils used to set up their hymn of hate
and laugh derisively at nets and other
impotent devices for excluding them. What
a wonderful summer this has been! But
will I always enjoy freedom from that hated
buzz? Sometimes I hope I will; but, then,
is it wise to hope that my deafness, caused
by a cold, will become permanent?

“Purple Brigadier”: In the course of a
long f life, much of which has been
devoted':' to the tutelage of niggers of
various ’shades, I have had occasion to
pay ' more attention to> statecraft than
to morality. So when the Sultan of Bhong, to
whom I was adviser, discovered that if he
were to; pay the interest on his national debt
he would have to cut his horses down from
500 to .250, his wives from -300 to 150 and
liis palace servants from 1000 to 500, I told
him the best thing to do was to repudiate.
He had already mortgaged Bhong up to the
neck, and the opportunity of putting an
effective stopper on his > borrowing proclivi-
ties seemed to me too good to be missed.
Bhong repudiated. As I had foreseen,
our export trade, upon which depended the
import of those foreign luxuries to which
Bhong had become habituated, '-went phut.
If we had sent a car got to a 1 foreign port it
would have been seized and confiscated.
Within a year most of the palace servants
were working in the fields, trying to make
good deficiencies in ; the food supply; many of
the Sultan’s horses , were dragging ploughs
and barrows, and his wives were toiling
hard at weaving, flour-milling and other
strenuous tasks. In three’years the country
had piled up a big: exportable surplus of
its products. Trading agents came and paid
us for them a sum far in ex'cess‘of Bhang’s
arrears of interest. ~ Against my advice the
Sultan did the moral thing, paid up his
foreign dues —and floated another whacking
big loan. I left in disgust.

“Tuppy”; The bushman who christened
the kookaburra “laughing jackass” wasn’t a
keen observer. Jacky' has brains and a strong,
though I fear perverted,. sense of humor.
From my bedroom window I have a view of
a giant eucalypt upon' whose lowest bough
the jackies of my neighborhood hold soirees.
As soon as five or six are assembled together
they are joined by an elder of their tribe, a
sin-hardened old reprobate, who relates to
them in low tones—“Ok, ok, ok,” it sounds
like—the latest naughty story. As he gets
towards the climax of his disgraceful narra-
tive there are Chuckles from the audience,
and when he stops there is a chorus of
ribald laughter. But he’s a cute old bird—
a regular ornithological O. Henry—for as
THE DADDY OF THEM ALL.
soon as the chorus stops he puts a coping-
stone on the yarn—just a few words —that
sets his hearers cachinnating so powerfully
that they nearly fall off the bough. My wife
says he’s a lady bird retailing to a select
coterie of Mrs. Kookas the scandals of our
quiet suburb, but I’ve been in too many
smoke-rooms not to put the correct interpre-
tation on the scene I daily witness.
“Avon”: It’s a toss-up which makes a

THE WAY IT WENT.
DEAR OLD LADY: “They’re saying Australian Diggers got higher pay than any other
troops at the war. I know my boy was always sending home for money—and
surely an officer should have been able to live on his pay.”

deal on what mess the young officer was in.”
of M.L., east coast, lassitude follows in the
train of a completely dry hot wind —the nor’-
wester. This breeze blows from the Tasman
warm and supercharged with moisture.
Striking the Southern Alps, the moisture is
condensed and Westland is drenched with
torrential rain. Dried out, the blast sweeps
over the plains of Canterbury, North Otago
and Southern Marlborough like a desert
sirocco. Looked at from the eastern side of
the Alps, the sky usually presents a uniform
grey ceiling of clouds, save on the western
horizon, where, curved as beautifully as if
it had been done with a compass, gleams
the “nor’-wester arc,” a stretch of sky show-
ing ‘over the Alps, glowing, not blue, but a
vivid green. Every road leading from the
coast to the mountains is a course along which
career clouds of greyish-white dust, rising
50 or 60 feet in the air, and on the farms
and in the towns and cities the watchword
is “Let’s not do anything to-day that we
can possibly put off till to-morrow.”

“T.P.”: Everybody in an old Wimmera
town, drew supplies of cold water during a
broiling summer from an immense under-
ground tank at the school. On the strength
of widely-spread rumors of impurity, a
sample was submitted to the Vie. Govern-
ment Analyst, who said there was nothing
the matter with it. Local bumbles still
stoutly maintained that cats had been
drowned in the tank and would cause an
epidemic. They declared they could smell
the deceased felines a dozen yards away.
So the fire brigade pumped out thousands
of gallons of pure, ice-cold, tasteless, odor-
less water. The captain went down on a
rope, and brought up a cupful of clean
sand and a small stick, pointed at each end.
“There’s your cat!” he snorted disgustedly.
It was dangerous for nippers to play tip-
cat after that, and rude youths meowed
after certain local dignitaries. As it hadn't
rained for six months, the cat-smellers weren t
at all popular.

“Naklioda”: The Victorian aboriginal is
dwindling so rapidly that the Government
has concentrated all that are left at Lake
Tyers, 210 miles east of Melbourne. Here
39 full-bloods pass a more-or-less halcyon
existence amidst some 250 half-castes or
quarter-castes or anything less. Each is
entitled to a weekly ration of lib. of soap,
Sib. of bread, 21b. of sugar, Jib. of tea, 71b.
of meat, tobacco, rice, sago, split peas, jam,
oatmeal, etc., according to requirements.
There is also a yearly allowance of two suits
of clothes and a pair of boots. The recipients
of these and other bounties can work if they
like, but outside protests recently brought
about a change of management, the previous
superintendent’s efforts to make the abo. self-
supporting being resented. Captain Newman
is the present manager. Those who care to
work get fivepence an hour, and there are
kangaroos, wallabies and emus to hunt and
plenty of fish in the ' lovely Lake Tyers.
Despite the allegedly degrading effect of a
life of idleness, ■ I was struck on a recent
visit by the dignity and self-sufficiency of
the full-bloods. The younger generation
talk like dinkum Australians; the older men
like Oxford dons, with soft, melodious voices.

“Ho Ki”: South-western China, having
already been sufficiently stripped by war and
famine, has now been invaded by a horde
of what is described as yellow rats, which
are eajting everything in the nature of vege-
tation in front of them as they progress.
These beasts, familiar enough periodically
in other, parts of China, as well as Siberia
and Northern Europe, are the dreaded lem-
mings, rodents which for no apparent
reason every few years suddenly undertake
a wholesale migration, pressing on until
disease wipes them out or the army marches
headlong into river or sea, as has often been
the case. It was these creatures which
some years ago swept down on Manchuria
and brought with them the deadly pneumonic
plague which decimated the people. For-
tunately an extra severe winter followed
close on their heels and wiped out the in-
vaders and the pest with them.
* * * *
“Taipo”: In the Maoriland port where I
spent some of my boyhood days, the
favorite rendezvous for the young bloods
of the village—ages ranging. from - 'six to
ten —was' on the foreshore under the
wharves. One, could swim, .fish, indulge in
perilous excursions along seaweed-slimed
timbers, sail boats, and in fact do what one
jolly well liked quite free from observation or
interference. I remember a day when “Ponto”
Pullen, having played for a while with a
model boat bought in a shop—all the rest
of us used craft fashioned out of flax-stick
or broom-stick, with hoop-iron for keels —
laid his treasure carefully aside and com-
menced fishing with six feet of much-joined
string, a bent pin, and some mussels for bait.
Soon he was hauling out dogfish, murdering
them, and committing their bodies to the
deep to the accompaniment of dreadful words.
One of the youngest kids of the gang, seeing
the big chap so preoccupied, pounced on the
precious boat, and, hidden from its owner by
a group of piles, commenced to sail it. It
was not a seaworthy craft. It had
rather too heavy a keel and a hollow under-
neath its deck that wasn’t watertight. Sud-
denly it capsized and 'sank. The borrower,
a child of greater valor than discretion, dived
in after it, but he must have knocked his
head against something, for he didn’t come
up. Luckily one of the kids had seen him
go in, and he conveyed the news to “Ponto.”
That worthy’s brow grew dark. “Where did
he go in?” he demanded. We showed him.
He stripped off his shirt and ragged knickers
and dived in. After what seemed to us a
dreadfully long time, he reappeared, gasping
and exhausted. “Can’t find him,” he splut-
tered. And then after taking a gulp or two
of air he went down again. That perform-
ance was repeated a third time before he
came up with the youngster, whose shirt
collar was gripped in his teeth. Our ideas
of first aid were hazy, but we held the un-
conscious kid upside down till we had got
a lot of water out of him, and then worked
his arms up and down. Presently an eyelid
fluttered, and the boy, who must have had
the constitution of a rhinoceros, was well
enough half an hour later to walk home with
the rest of us. It was noted then that
“Ponto” had his precious boat tightly clasped
to his breast. “How did yer get yer boat
back, Ponto?” we chorused. He looked at
us with scorn. “I had ter find that first,”
he said.

“Long Dan”: Fishermen at Cooktown
(Q.) report that they recently gathered in
their nets a sea-serpent. Estimated at
approximately 30 feet in length it had the
general shape of an eel, but along its neck
was a handsome translucent mane. This
was not purely ornamental, for when its
owner became enraged it was erected in
a serrated row of venomous spikes in much
the same way as the quills of the porcupine.
The serpent’s head was massive, and when
the jaws opened the face looked like Ber-
nard Shaw saying something cynical. It
was allowed to escape (sea serpents seem
to be destined to escape) and went out to
sea, joyously lashing its supple tail.

“Pick”: “Murrawong” (B. 4/2/’3l), who
spills disbelief over my blind woolclasser,
fails to differentiate between the man going
blind and the one who through lifelong lack
of vision has attained so keen a touch that
his fingers take the place of eyes. I can
introduce to “Murrawong” a blind French-
polisher who by feeling alone distinguishes
the faintest irregularity either of coloring or
surface in his work, or under the successive
layers of varnish. Compared with the delicacy
of touch required in that man’s operations,
wool-classing would be simple to a blind per-

agree, though, that in the blade days wool-
classing was not so fine an art as now, nor
regarded as so important.

DAMPCOURSE.
GOOSE GOLD.
“After killing a goose a farmer in the Dorrigo
(N.S.W.) found a nugget of gold about twice the
size of a pea in its crop.”—' “S. M. Herald.”
Waving a copy of the “S. M. Herald”
like a banner, Reg Bunkum arrived at my
office with his latest flotation—the Goose
Gold Extraction Company, Ltd.
It appeared that he had an option on
500 eggs of the same breed of goose as the
one that had laid-in the golden nugget. And
another on an incubator
which he could get for
£2 7s. 6d., provided he re-
moved it from the owner’s
premises before the bailiffs
arrived.
His proposal was a
£50,000 company,. with
£20,000 in sovereigns and
20,000 fully-paid-up £1 shares
for himself as promoter. He
calculated that, keeping up
the relays of eggs, he could produce
8500 goslings in a year. Estimating (“con-
servatively,” as he put it) a pellet of gold
twice the size of a pea as worth £2, the
revenue would thus be £17,000 p.a., to which
could be added the Government subsidy on
gold production. Income from the slaught-
ered geese he decided to set against costs
of maintenance.
By the time Bunkum had had two drinks
at my expense he was viewing the prospective
profits in a more optimistic light than ever.
He decided to appoint himself managing
director at £5OOO p.a. in Bank of England
notes. After which he borrowed 2s. from
me on his prospects and left.

ANNOUNCING
N.S.W.'s First 100 p.c. Sound Talkie,
POLITICAL DOPE.
This Prime Farcical Extravaganza is a
product of the Macquarie-strect Studios. The
antics of the two
priceless slap-stick
comedians Tom and
Jack (said to be the
highest paid in the
State) are guaran-
teed to make you
laugh till the tears
come—and the tears
are likely to continue
after the laughing
has finished. Their
snappy duet “You’re
an Adjectival Liar
and a Blank-blank
Fool” is a scream.
Most of the scenes
(and a number of
the actors) were
“shot” in the Par-
liamentary bar. An
amusing divertisse-
ment is an aspirate
juggling turn by Tom
Henley. You will
hear Weaver, of the
Wonder Voice, mak-
ing a noise like a
coalmine.
A surprise is the
Bacchanalian Scene,
reminiscent of
“Cairo,” enacted by
the entire company
during a financial
speech. The spec-
tacle of S 9 M’s.L.A.
reclining on the
backs of their necks
is made more voluptuous by startling
examples of cacophonous snoring. The leit-
motif is an Empire Speech delivered through-
out, to an accompaniment of “raspberries”
and hiccups.
The story is based on self-love, the theme
song being “That Infamous Agreement,” sung
with majority chorus by the chief comedian.
The supers in this scene are 40 union bosses
led by the Scottish genius Haggis Jock. The
final chorus, “Both Jack and Tom Run a
Bob-in Show,” is excruciatingly funny, being
performed by the full company in two sepa-
rate parts, and in different keys. A feature
is a complete absence of women from the
cast. The photography is good, the princi-
pals being used to limelight.
Being political the show is expected to
prove a dead loss.

A (A.)
SHADOW SHOWS.
“Sea Legs,” which did a recent sprint at
Sydney Capitol, is a lavish piece of foolery
written round Jack Oakie. H'e is an Ameri-
can pug who, in the capacity of a million-
aire, gets aboard a battleship belonging to
some unspecified Power whose officers speak
broken English. Eugene Pallette is there,
and they do all the things Hollywood A.B.’s
are in the habit of doing. While on duty
they insult the officers, do no work, make
love to the captain’s lady friends, drop gar-
bage on visitors, throw important people
overboard, and act generally to the preju-
dice of such good order and naval discipline
as the vessel boasts. On shore, where they
spend most of their time, they meet Harry
Green, and wreck a restaurant to which he
introduces them by starting a custard-pie
battle in it. A certain amount of comedy
can still be extracted from the heaving of
pies, but restraint and an element of sur-
prise are essential. Here the melancholy
spectacle is offered of everybody being plas-
tered by hundreds of pies, and the episode
is a measure of the whole overdone show.
Perhaps the most frigntful moment is when
Jack Oakie and Lillian Roth (as the cap-
tain’s daughter) burst unexpectedly into
song while leaning over a rail in a heavy sea,
i but there are one or two more almost
equally painful. The photography is splen-
did, and the sound-recording bad.
Fox-Movietone’s “A Devil with Women”
has a - misleading title. Victor McLaglen is
the Juanesque he-man, and he loses Mena
Maris, who is the only girl he wants. She
yields to the gentler sex-appeal of Humphrey
Bogart (Hollywood’s latest acquisition from
the musical comedy stage), and McLaglen
accepts the blow with his customary amiabil-
ity. So much for the necessary love interest.
The general level of the picture is of
another order. Though it does not rank with
the best it is above the average. The venue
is a South American republic under revolu-
tionary conditions, and it would be worth
while as a travel gazette alone. The heroine
comes from the Argentine, and she looks it.
There is a South American train with a
conductor who would be discoverable no-
where else, and a hostelry with wash-basin
arrangements that are full of local color.
The casting is superb, due to the fact that,
however slight the part, Hollywood has a
player to fill it. An astonishingly rotund
negress—those who saw “Condemned” will
remember her—appears and disappears
within a second in a crowd, but contributes
her value. The South American general is
real —the stage could have done no more
than attempt him by means of make-up—
and his army matches him. One of the
characters is a monkey. He is an animal
of rare charm and plays his part to perfec-
tion, including in his performance examples
of the difficult art of timing. He might
have timed correctly once, or even twice, in
the legitimate; here he times with precision
three times daily. The photography, furni-
ture, architecture and accessories generaiiy
are on the same high plane as the acting.
* * *
The announcement that “The Loves of
Fu Sen,” at Melb. Auditorium, was a
“smashing drama of love and intrigue, a
story that will Grip you from Start to
Finish,” prepared this paper for the worst;
consequently it was agreeably surprised to
discover itself, not in the company of Los
Angeles laundrymen masquerading as sinis-
ter Celestials employed in the too-deliberate
seduction of pure American womanhood, but
of real Chinese in China, engaged in the
serious interpretation of one of their own
historic incidents. The play was made
in Shanghai by Chinamen, the settings have
ihe austere beauty of the best Chinese archi-
tecture, the story is traditional and hence
has the dignity and sense of form almost of
Greek drama, and the incident depicted is
the Boxer Rebellion, which is popularly sup-
posed to have been a revolt against the white
man, yet no white man is even mentioned.
The acting gives the impression that if
the silent film survives it will reach its
highest expression in China. All the actors
are consummate pantomimists. The Celes-
tial visage is usually supposed to be an
enigmatic mask. These people give the final
expression to their emotions with such defi-
niteness as to elucidate even the alien con-
ventions and the ungrammatical and ill-
spelt subtitles couched in Americanese. There
is the old father whose two children are
torn from him during the rising of the
Boxers, and who gives to each a jade locket
as identification in case Fate should throw
them together again. There is the young
student, handsome, intellectual, sublimely
conscious of the fact that in China learning
is placed even above marathon dancing, who
comes top of the examinations in Peking
and returns, the Don Bradman of his vil-
lage, to find that his paramour is about to
be executed for murder. There are the
jealous wife, the scolding sister-in-law and
the incompetent magistrate, who humbly
takes his orders from the successful student.
There is real pathos and no false sentiment
in the situation of the old father (described
as “Dad” in the subtitles) discovering that
his daughter is to be decapitated for a crime
committed by his just-recovered son. lie
flings himself over the kneeling bodies of
the spectators of the execution and is
dragged along the ground, clinging to the
basket in wdiicli his daughter is being car-
ried. If the piece appears to lack drama
in places it is probably because the Westerner
does not fathom the depths of the motives or
feel the strength of the conventions. It is
extraordinary how quickly you accept the
conventions, extrinsically absurd to Euro-
pean eyes, so that your sense of the ridi-
culous is not aroused when a character,
apprised of some dreadful intelligence,
exhibits his emotion by oscillating his
shoulders as if he were mixing a cocktail.
The chief concession to modern manners is
the absence of bound feet amongst the
women. It would take some courage to
swallow a heroine with legs like clothespegs.
The picture was made by the Great Lil-
lium Film Co., and brought here by the
Chinese community. It is being distributed
by Independent Films, a local organisation
which is struggling between the two Aus-
tralo-American combines to introduce more
1 variety into the cinema business.

THE
STUFF TO GIVE'EM
MECOITT'S LINSEED MEAL
THE WHEAT POSITION STUDIED.
“Agronom” : At present wheat-growing is
unprofitable in Australia on even the' most
efficiently managed farms; but wheatgrowers
should not lose heart on that account. The
same is true of the business in all the ex-
porting countries and the bed of travail
is shared by almost every Australian indus-
try, primary and secondary. But an analysis
of the position leads one to believe that the
condition is only temporary.
While there are many factors causing the
present low prices, a large carry-over in
exporting countries associated with the
determination of great parts of Europe to be
self-supporting in this commodity has been
chiefly responsible. Europe has been favored
with good weather, resulting in heavy crops,
and has bought comparatively little foreign
wheat. When bad or middling seasons come
again in the Northern Hemisphere Europe
will be forced to import more wheat.
Most of the wheat grown in the export-
ing countries is produced in semi-arid areas
where climatic vagaries cause extreme fluc-
tuations in the acre yields ; they vary from
3 to 30 bushels. This means that the world
is always gambling with its bread supply.
To reduce its wheatfields to the extent of
trying to grow just sufficient for require-
ments would inevitably result in an extreme
shortage in drought years. And drought
continually threatens the world’s wheat
areas. Surplus production is necessary in
good years to avoid famine in bad years. A
droughty year sees all these surplus stocks
used up, with consequent improvement in
the price; a succession of lean years would
see the price soar.
Nevertheless, world acreage must shrink
with the pinch of low prices. American and
Canadian growers in regions where a variety
of crops can be grown will turn to more
profitable avenues of production. In the
semi-arid areas, however, there will be very
little reduction in the area cropped. There’s
nothingi else to turn to.
The position is similar in Australia. In
districts where the men on the land can
diversify their farming, they should lose no
time in making the change to more profit-
able _ activities. In such areas livestock
farming, including the growing of fodder
crops, should figure prominently. In our and
and semi-arid areas change is scarcely
possible. Wheat is the hardiest plant we
grow, and nothing else will succeed in these
areas. It would be unsound to advise farmers
in such parts to reduce acreage ; their chief
hope is to grow as much as they can, for
the world’s crop may be short and the price
good. Although there is no prospect of imme-
diate relief, those who can carry on, direct-
ing every ingenuity to cutting costs of pro-
duction, will be amply rewarded when the
price recovers; and recover it will.
SECOND-GRADE WHEAT.
“Valerin” : What is going to become of the
large quantities of second-grade wheat
stored in the N.S.W. silos? Roughly, it can
be divided into two kinds —bleached wheat,
which may or may not be below the silo
standard of 581 b. to the bushel, and “pinched”
wheat, which was well below the standard.
The silo management in mixing these two
sorts has made a “shandygaff,” which is
going to be hard to dispose of.
Experiments carried out in 1912 by F. B.
Guthrie and G. W. Norris showed that the
effects of “bleaching” do not reduce the
milling value of wheat to an appreciable
extent. The results of investigations pub-
lished in the “Agricultural Gazette,” Nov.,
1912, show that “the deterioration lies prin-
cipally in the reduced bushel weight, and
to a lesser extent in the gluten content;
otherwise the behavior in the mill of samples
of bleached and of unbleached wheat is
very similar. The lowering in the bushel
weight is, however, very serious, amounting
to 51b. a bushel or even more under normal
conditions.”
The loss in the “lowering in the bushel
weight” is borne by the grower in dockage
on delivery, so that the miller has no kick
coming; the loss in gluten content is so
small as hardly to warrant a reduction—
perhaps, 1 to 2 per cent. Generally, the
dockage for bleached wheat is assessed at
Id. for every pound under f.a.q. standard
if fixed, or 601 b. otherwise. If the bleached
wheat had been kept separate, arriving at a
milling value would have been comparatively
easy ; the “pinched” wheat could have been
utilised for pig or stock feed.
FEEDING WHEAT TO PIGS.
“Bendee”: “Tuart’s” observations (B.
18/2/’3l) on the Rutherglen pig-feeding
experiments are based on wheat at 2s. 6d.
per bushel. At Alexandria (Sydney), as I
write, good wheat is being knocked down
for anything from Is. 6d. to Is. lOd. per
bushel by the truck. Freight and commis-
sion are deducted out of this wicked price,
which brings the coat of the wheat, when fed to
pigs on the growers’ own farms, well below
Is. per bushel. Indeed, it will not net a man
Is. if he trucks it to Sydney.
It is reckoned that wheat can be profitably
fed to pigs at 3s. per bushel., even when
store pigs have to be purchased. At present
prices it would not only pay to feed it to
pigs, but it would pay to store as much as
possible for future operations. Dennis should
not be introduced as a store on the farm
just when wheat is low in price ; he should
be there all the time.
There is always a tendency to think that
anything is good enough for pigs. In these
days when economic production is a neces-
sity, the pig should receive the same careful
attention and consideration as the stud
sheep. If a herd is built up from carefully-
selected stock, all the slow-growing sorts being
culled out and the sows which do not produce
good, even litters being fattened and sold,
the farmer will soon realise that in the pig
he has something which will bring him in a
profit year in and year out —always on the
spot to convert pinched or otherwise damaged
grain into profit. It is only the farmer who
keeps long-nosed, scraggy sorts who will
never reap enough profit to convince him
that pigs are worth the trouble that estab-
lishing a good herd entails.
I am surpised to notice, however, that
the Vic. Government contemplates breeding
the large White York on to the Middle York
for further experiments in wheat feeding.
The white breeds are likely to scald in hot
climates, such as our wheat belts. It is
almost universally recognised that the Berk.-
Tam. and come-back cross is without
superior for all Australian conditions. What
is more important, it is the breed which
meets factory and consumers’ requirements,
for either pork or bacon.
If ever there was a chance to feed stock
cheaply it is at the present time. Why don’t
poultry-farmers, sheepmen and pig-breeders
who are not wheatgrowers co-operate and
buy wheat by the truck, direct from the
farmer, at the price he is getting for it by
auction?
COULD WE REPEAT BAWRA ?
Dear Bulletin, —There has been a good
deal of talk about forming an organisation
to control the marketing of our wool on lines
similar to Bawra. Is it practicable?
As to the remarkable success which
attended Bawra in disposing of an enor-
mous quantity of wool on a gradually rising-
market, it must not be forgotten that a
benevolent British Government had paid our
growers a handsome flat rate foi? their clips,
in some cases years before the wool was
actually sold in the open market. Bawra
was essentially a winding-up association. Its
chief function was to market to the best
advantage a huge accumulation of wool
stocks. It carried out its duties in an un-
impeachable manner. But it did not in
any shape or form finance one single grower.
The finance which enabled our growers to
carry on was provided by the British Gov-
ernment almost as soon as the wool was
available for purchase in the Australian
brokers’ stores.
It would seem to follow that any system
of control at the present time would like-
wise require heavy financing if it was to
achieve any measure of success. It is equally
clear that we have now no British Govern-
ment to buy our clip. We have no Austra-
lian Government capable of financing any
more primary or secondary industries, and we
have no private financial houses which would
undertake to underwrite a loan out of which
to provide funds either (1) to enable the
grower to carry on until the world’s price for
wool improved to an extent which would
allow him to meet his costs of production,
or (2) to pay him at once the difference
between the world price for wool and the
Australian cost of production. Any scheme
of market control would at lea.st require
financial support to the extent indicated, and
at the present time no such support is likely
to be forthcoming.
This is not written with any idea of prov-
ing that some help should not be given to
the woolgrower. If anyone is entitled to
assistance he is. What might be done (and
this is the point) is for the Government to
ensure that what aid the people can afford
to give to industry is evenly distributed over
the whole economic structure. At present
the sugar and dairying industries and count-
less secondary industries are being supported
in one form or another by the whole people.
The wool industry does not share to any
extent in this distribution of public assist-
ance, yet its need is just as urgent, and the
importance of it to Australia is greater than
that of any of the other industries which
are receiving generous help from the people’s
pockets.-—Yours, David A. S. Campbell.
SHEARING ECONOMY.
“Kripple” : “All handpieces and duplicate
parts for their maintenance to be sripplied
by the contractor.” By inserting this clause
in their shearing contracts pastoralists would
effect a considerable saving. Since the
general advent of contract shearing 80 per
cent, of the handpieces in Australia- —and
there are many thousands —have become un-
necessary. Unlike the headgears, they take
no time to erect or dismantle, and can be
transported from shed to shed at little cost;
Two or three handpieces in conjunction with
a crutching outfit are all that stations
employing contractors require.
The handpiece comes in for much unneces-
sary abuse on the part of careless shearers.
If this must be tolerated, the expense should
fall on the contractor who engages and con-
trols the men. Incompetent “experts,” too,
are not uncommon at sheds. The waste from
such sources, either for lack of “the stitch
in time” or injudicious use of duplicate
parts, runs into big figures. Here again
the cost should be borne by the contractor.
The suggested clause is the way out for
the pastpralist, even though existing
machines have to be laid aside.
IN PRAISE OF POTASH.
“Iv. Alyum” : Some years ago I made care-
ful manurial trials with potatoes. In the
potash plots the best return came from top-
dressing the potash salt on the fall plough-
ing ; but it was nothing to brag about. The
original scheme was to carry on the plots
for three years and to retain the tubers from
each plot annually for re-sowing. The potatoes
were “greened” and sprouted in trays, and
a blind person could readily pick out the
potash-fertilised seed. The crop return from
this seed the following season was something
to brag about. The after-result was that
the whole of the potato crop was sold before
it was dug to merchants who retailed it as
a special strain at a special price—probably
to farmers who failed to see the benefit of
potash manuring.
Another judgment may interest “Wilt”
(B. 31/12/-30). My citrus trees commenced
to refoliate badly last winter. A dressing
of sulphate of potash at the rate of a pound
per tree stopped the defoliation within a
month, and at the moment my grove “does
me proud.” Again I take off my hat to
potash. There is no doubt about its value,
and it is well known that the fertiliser junc-
tions, at the extremities —that is, the outside
growth of plants.
Potash is not prescribed for wheat by the
experts, simply because, speaking generally,
our wheat soils and subsoils are rich in
their content of the compound. Soils in
country of ironstone formation, as men-
tioned by “Wilt,” are -usually rich in potash,
and geologically you would expect it. To
derive a benefit from potash manuring the
soil must be deficient in potash but other-
wise in good heart. It would be useless to
apply the thing when the’ soil was lacking in
available phosphoric acid or nitrogen, lime,
etc. In my opinion maximum growth occurs
under certain conditions, one of which is
that the correct ratio of nitrogen to phos-
phoric acid to potash is present in the soil.
“Wilt’s” suggestion of farm experiments
by the farmer is a good one, but a prelimin-
ary trial, wherever possible, should be
made in cubical boxes two feet square, filled
with the average soil to be tested and sunk in
the ground, so that the surface of the soil
in the box is level with the soil outside.
Drainage must be allowed for at the lowest
end of the trench. The details of the experi-
ment may be worked out by Dad or Dave,
but before anything is attempted it should
be remembered that the odds are probably a
thousand to one that phosphoric acid will
be the limiting factor, which means that the
soil in every box omitting the “checks” (no
manure) is to receive the same dressing of
super. Make the trial on sowings of pota-
toes, peas, beans arid clover (or a selec-
tion from these), and, besides the fun, a deal
of useful information will eventuate.
Since writing this contribution, I have
read with interest the manurial trials con-
ducted by the Vic. Department of Agricul-
ture on bean plots in Gippsland. All the
fertilisers used gave increased yields, but
complete manures returned the biggest yield
and the greatest profit per acre. One more
for potash.
THE TURNIP FAMILY.
“Hortus”: Now’s tlie time—in N. S.
Wales at least —for sowing white turnips,
swedes, mangolds, sugar beet and mangel-
wurzels. Where possible, every farmer
should put in a crop of wurzels, especially
if he lives in the coastal and tableland dis-
tricts. Only a small patch is needed; the
seed is cheap ; the yield may be 20 tons to
the acre, or even more; the crop can be
pitted, and kept right through winter.
Chopped rip in a machine and mixed with
chaff they make the food succulent and
palatable and keep the milk supply up to
standard.
A fairly rich soil is necessary. Plough under
the stubble of a previous hay crop, and apply
super, (4cwt. to lcwt. per acre) at time of
seeding. As the crop requires plenty of mois-
ture during its growth, plough deeply as
soon as possible; it’s a good plan to cross-
plough, too. Just before sowing, plough
shallow, harrow and cross-harrow, until a
fine tilth is procured. Amount of seed re-
quired is 41b, to 61b. to the acre; some mix
it with super, in the manure-box of a wheat-
drill, but this requires careful handling.
Rows should be 3ft. apart.
When plants are a reasonable height thin
out with a sharp hoe to about 18in. Keep
clean between rows to check weed-growth,
and also to keep the mulch nice and loose.
Tliis cannot he overstressed, for moisture-
conservation is everything in dealing with
these turnip crops, and you must serve the
water up to them. The crop takes normally
about seven months to mature.
When pitting, be sure to choose a spot
high and dry, where drainage is of the best.
Have long, low pits rather than high ones,
witli slightly sloping gutter on either side
to allow for water to run off quickly. Top
the roots, put them carefully into the pits
to avoid bruising, and cover with straw and
earth. Arrange to have flat top and sloping
sides. They will keep like this for months.
Now times are hard every farmer should
be on the lookout for a crop that will help
him to check expenditure during a dry
spell or during the winter. Mangel-wurzels,
finely chopped and mixed with chaff or hay,
halve the feed bill. A good crop of wurzels
lias a better feeding value than a crop of
maize or oats cut as green fodder.
HOME-MADE ARROWROOT.
“Mulyan” : While on a farm on the Rich-
mond River I planted a small patch with
arrowroot, and from the bulbs obtained two
501 b. bags of meal. The grinding was done
in a home-made machine, which consisted
of a narrow packing-case, with punched tin
on the inner sides, slanting towards the
centre, and a roller covered with punched
tin between them. The bulbs were ground
by the rough edges of the punched holes, and
the stuff dropped into a tub of water under-
neath. Water was used all the time until
the meal was cleaned of fibre and spread on
sheets to dry. Even the bulbs had to be
peeled in water, or they turned black when
cut. Apart from that, the whole process wias
very simple.
Arrowroot is easily grown, and is a heavy
cropper. My patch received no attention
from the time it was planted with a hoe till
the bulbs were dug up. It is a useful crop,
especially on farms where there is a family
of young children. Very little ground is
needed to supply them with breakfast food
for a year, and the youngsters can do most
of the work themselves. For variety, maize
meal, another home product, can be mingled
with it. Corn cakes, too, are a wholesome
food. Where there is plenty of milk, these
home products save the flourbag.
FEATHER-EATING.
“Jack Point”: This is a vice which is
learned by accident, and if it is allowed to
go unchecked until it becomes a confirmed
habit the only cure is to kill the bird. It
usually begins when fowls haven’t enough to
do to occupy them. A hen gets hold of a
feather which has a drop of blood on it;
she likes the taste and goes looking for
more, especially if her ration contains a
deficiency of meat meal, etc. Then she may
pull out every one of her feathers within
reach, and start on the others.
As with most poultry ailments, preven-
tion should be the watchword. See that the
ration is properly balanced and contains suf-
ficient protein, with due consideration for
time of year, age of birds, etc. Don’t feed
too much to hens not in full lay, or it may
lead to something worse than feather-eating.
Give plenty of green feed and make the hens
scratch for the grain portion of their daily
ration, burying it in good clean litter, so that
they will' be kept busy.
QUESTIONS ANSWERED.
(Transferred from Service Department .)
Wliat is The Bulletin’s scheme for pro-
ducing wheat at a price that will pay costs?
—1385.
(1) The price of land must come down,
and with it interest. (2) Cost of govern-
ment and public services must be reduced,
and the most hopeless railway lines abandoned.

FARM ACCOUNTS
iiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiira
The articles published on “The Bulletin s Land page have been reprinted
and added to.
In these lessons the farmer who did not previously know a thing about book-
keeping is carried along, step by step, and shown how accounts are kept.
Every entry is explained in the simplest and clearest possible language.
The object is to enable the farmer to put his business on a proper basis and
keep it there.
In no other calling is it more necessary to follow every branch of the business
and see where a profit is being made and where a loss.
Many a farmer has come to grief simply through not knowing that he was
going back a little further every year. Had he known in time he might
have made changes that would have saved the situation.
The trouble about most attempts to show the farmer how to keep accounts
is that they assume he knows something about book-keeping.
“The Bulletin,*’ at the request of scores of farm readers, decided to produce
a cheap textbook in which the whole business of book-keeping would be
dealt with from the very beginning.
The little book is published at a price which brings it within the means of everybody.
It will be sent from any “Bulletin* ’ Office for sixpence, to which must be added 2d.
for postage.
Though designed primarily for the man on the land, it will be found just as valuable
to traders and others who have hitherto had only a foggy idea about accounts.

Managing Director: A. P. McLEAN. General Secretary: R. V. BOOTH,
(°) lo enable the farmer to get the
tuJi benefit of the protection of secondary
industries, a fairly high price should be
fixed tor grain consumed in Australia. The
pales Tax is an excellent medium for giv-
ing the farmer this advantage. (4) It is
quite realised that the Australian wheat-
larmor cannot compete at the moment with-
out special assistance; and The B. has
advocated an arbitrary reduction of interest
on bank deposits so that interest on farm
advances may be cut down —this because
an export trad* is indispensable. (5) The
business must be carried on as a speculative
business, and every harvest must not be
expected to pay for itself. (6) Good farming
must be more general. At present too many
farmers think improved machinery (bought
on t.-p.) can take the place of improved
methods.
(1) What district in Vic. produces the
best wheat? (2) Would the cost of flour
in Melbourne be lower by milling near ivhere
the wheat is produced and shipping flour to
the city or by shipping wheat to Melbourne
and milling in the city? (3) Where can I
find out which firm manufactures the most
efficient and up-to-date flour-milling mach-
inery in the world? —1632.
(1) Wimmera. (2) Probably by shipping
wheat to Melbourne and milling in the
city. (3) Consult H. Simon, millers’ engi-
neers, Sydney.
(1) Where and how to make annlication
lor land in Gentralia and N.T.? (2) What
are the prospects of cattle-raising in those
parts? (3) Nearest market for cattle? (4)
Does the Federal Government encourage
settlement and make advances to settlers ? —
1729.
(1) Apply to the North Australia Com-
mission, Darwin, stating whether you want
land on lease or on grazing license. (2)
Not very promising at present. (3) For
North Australia, Q’land and Wyndham in
W.A.; cattle from Centralia are sold prin-
cipally in S.A. (4) Assistance may be
granted to settlers to the extent of £6OO for
the purchase of stock, machinery, plant, etc.,
provided funds are available and the appli-
cant is possessed of capital to the extent of
one-third of the amount of assistance desired.
(1) Is land easy to obtain upon Norfolk
Island , and at what price? (2) Under what
conditions can land be leased? (3) Could a
farmer there eke out a living at other work
while awaiting his first returns? (4) How
is water obtainable? —1909.
(1) and (2) All Crown land available for
settlement has been leased, and it is seldom
that freehold land is offered for sale. Por-
tions of Crown leases may at times be
obtained by private treaty. These leases are
for 28 years at an annual rental of 3s. to
7s. per acre. A certain amount of agricul-
tural experience is required on the part of
tenants. (3) There are but few opportuni-
ties of securing casual employment. (4)
Rain-water may be collected from the roofs
of buildings, and an artesian supply can be
tapped by well-sinking.
How can green bananas be ripened in
winter? The climate of my district is dif-
ferent from that of Q’land banana-growing
localities. —l 674.
Ripening is effected in rooms 10ft. x 10ft.,
7ft. high. The walls are double and filled with
sawdust. There are two holes lin. in dia-
meter in the ceiling and two just above the
floor level, to allow the gases to escape.
Each room has one gas-jet. The rooms
should be packed reasonably full if the fruit
is in cases. The gas is kept burning for an
hour to an hour and a half, then turned off;
and the fruit is kept in the room for
two to three days, except in very cool
weather, when it should be kept in for four
to six days—the time depends entirely upon
its condition before placing there. Consider-
able experience is necessary to successfully
color bananas by this method. In the most
modern type of ripening-room temperatures
and humidity can be controlled.
(1) Suitable type of evergreen hedge to
enclose small paddock in Vic.? (2) Time
and method of planting? (3) Cost for
1000 feet ? —1723.
(1) A good deal would depend upon
locality, but in general the cypress (Cupres-
sus liorizontalis, var. Lambertiana) should
be suitable, being useful, quick-growing and
giving perfect shelter. It is long-lived and
even if left untrimmed does not go “wild”
in the way box-tliorn, hawthorn and many
others do. (2) Plant in autumn or through
the winter. If plenty of water is available
cypress can be planted at any time. Either
dig deep holes for the plants, at least 3ft.
square, or plough up and cultivate a strip
round the paddock. Plant Bft. to 10ft.
apart. (3) Well-grown plants, 2ft. 6in.
high, will cost up to 2s. each. Smaller
ones might be bought at 6d. each. Plants
struck from cuttings should be obtained.
Don’t use seedlings. Rimington, Mt. Victor-
road, Ivew, and Arthur Ilodgins and Son,
Essen don, supply.
llow many cubic feet go to the ton of oaten
hay freshly cut and, loose? —1676.
Varies from 150 to 180, depending on
height of heap and quality of chaff.
(1) Will passion-fruit do well in the Mil-
dura irrigation district? (2) Most suitable
variety? (3) At what age does it commence
to bear? (4) llow long do the plants live?
(5) Address of breeders in Vic. who could
supply black Langshans? (6) Breeder of
black Minorcas? (7) What is the best
strain of winter-laying hen? —1810.
(1) No reason known why they shouldn’t.
(2) Passiflora edulis. (3) Generally second
or third year. (4) About 10 years. (5)
Clark, King and Co., 30 Guildford-lane, Mel-
bourne, Cl. (6) G. Dwyer, Karalee, Grey-
thorn-road, Balwyn, E 9, Vic. (hens only).
(7) No best strain.
A is a landowner and B a sharegrower of
tobacco. A provides the land , the plant and
the curing barns; B does the work and pro-
vides the plant. The cost of fertiliser and
extra labor is divided equally. What would
be an equitable division of the profits under
these conditions? Alternatively, what are
the usual conditions on a “fifty-fifty” share
basis? —1675.
The usual form of agreement in such cases
is that the owner provides the land, ploughs
and harrows it to time of transplanting,
and furnishes buildings for curing and stor-
ing the tobacco after curing. He also finds
quarters for the share man, and provides
all horses and implements for cultivating
and transplanting the crop and for carting
to the curing barns, as well as sharing the
cost of hessian, twine, fertiliser and freight to
market. The share man grows sufficient plants
to fill up the area, and does all work in the
field, curing and preparation for sale. All
work is under the direction of the land-
owner, who conducts the sale and pays the
proceeds on the basis of 50 p.c. to himself
and 50 p.c. to the share man. In the case
cited a half-share to the landowner phis his
half-share of extra labor costs, the remainder
going to the share man, would be a fair
division.
(1) Approximate net annual return from
a poultry farm running 1000 hens? (2)
Prospects for this industry? (3) Is experi-
ence essential? , (4) Gould a, going concern
of this size in Vic., with small residence, he
financed with a capital of £4OO? —1685.
(1) Can’t say. Much depends on
the quality of the birds and owner’s busi-
ness ability. (2) The industry in Vic.
is in a sound position. Poultry-farmers
are feeding birds to-day at 30 to 40
p.c. less than at this time last year, and
eggs are a penny a dozen higher. Owing to
the favorable rate of exchange a record
number of eggs was exported last season.
(3) Yes. You should start in a small way,
and learn the business. (4) It is very un-
likely that a good poultry farm could be pur-
chased in Vic. at present, but many large
farms, including one with 50,000 birds on it,
started with less capital than that mentioned.
HINTS FOR THE FARM.
“Crossbred” : Try a few pigs for clearing.
A roll of pig-netting and a few stakes make
a quick paddock, and they will root out
briars, thorn, noxious weeds and pests; in
addition their manure is one of the best for
crops. You can’t beat the grunters to clear
out couch or paspalum that has taken a hold
of your cultivation.
“Observer” : When you knock off plough-
ing for the dinner hour, unhook your horses,
water and tie under good shade. I passed
seven North Coast (N.S.W.) farms in the
lunch hour on a day 94deg. in the shade; on
six the poor mokes were standing hooked up
in the broiling sun.
“Sylvester” : In fencing, if you have your
rammer the exact length of your posts it
will often save you from lifting heavy posts
out of the hole again to make adjustments.
“L’Fou”: Ever notice how stock tend to
congregate in the corners of a paddock?
Horses especially will hang about a corner
watching what’s doing on the road or gos-
siping with other horses. One panel of
fencing will make that corner into a trian-
gular tree-guard. You can’t plough right
into the corner, so why not plant a good
type of tree and let the animals have the
benefit of it?
“Observer”: It is an expense curing
bucket-fed calves of scours, and it can be
prevented. Add water to the separated milk
from their first feed until they are weaned.
This gives 99 per cent, immunity, and the
calves are assured of a good foundation for
their milking years.
“B. Sting” ; When bees lose their queen,
examine the brood frames. If queen cells
are present, or if there are fresh eggs in the
uncovered cells, the bees may be depended on
to rear a new queen; if both are absent,
furnish an egg-filled comb from another hive.
Neglect this, and the swarm will dwindle
and finally cease to exist.
“Y.”: The cutworm may be unearthed by
turning over the earth around the roots care-
fully with a pocket-knife; the beastie is
brown in color and curls round into a circle
when disturbed. It can be effectively con-
trolled by poison baits distributed around
the plants. This is a reliable formula: Bran,
201 b.; Paris green, lib.; treacle, 2qts.;
five finely-chopped oranges or lemons, or 4oz.
amyl acetate; and water, 2 gallons. The
Paris green is well mixed with the bran
first and then the whole, including the
chopped-up oranges or lemons, moistened
with the treacle and sufficient water to
obtain the right consistency. From 61b. to
201 b. of the mixture is required to be dis-
tributed per acre in small pellets accord-
ing to the plants being grown and the dis-
tance between each.
“Mimosa”: It pays to brand farm tools,
and the method is simple. On steel or other
metal objects first clean with fine sandpaper
or emery dust and oil; warm and coat with
beeswax so as to have a thin coat or film
when cooled. Then with a sharp-pointed
instrument scratch cleanly in the wax the
letters or name to be etched, being sure the
scratch mark goes clear down to the steel
or metal. Then brush lightly or drop on
some commercial nitric-acid, letting it re-
main for 20 minutes. Wash thoroughly with
water in which baking soda has been dis-
solved. Warm and wipe off the melted' wax.
Scrub thoroughly with kerosene and any
lubricating grease. Nitric acid burns and
is destructive to clothes; baking-soda dis-
solved in water is the antidote.
“Odd Job”: An old, orchardist near me
opens up a circle round his trees this time
of the year. He catches all the falling leaves,
adds a barrow of manure and gets the autumn-
winter rain; the frost sweetens the lot and
kills the insects, when lie turns the soil back
again. He gets capital crops.
“Dimon” : Keep the wheels of the cart or
dray painted; it prevents the spokes and
tyre getting loose. Also go over the vehicle
now and again with a spanner, and tighten
up loose bolts. The conveyance soon rattles
to wreck if this is neglected.
“Wandi”: To get rid of white ants that
have got into a building, find the ground con-
nection, and insert a dab or two of paste
made of arsenic and sugar. Besides the
ants that eat it, others die from eating the
dead. If you haven’t arsenic, lead black
ants to the broken ground-connection with
a trail of treacle.
“Gosling”: A few geese round a farm are
a good spec.; among other things, they will
clean up rough sour grass and serve as a
substitute for watchdogs. A gander and
four geese make a good mating, and the goose
will lay about 10 to 20 eggs at a sitting.
Give them plenty of room and coop them up
till the goslings are strong. Soaked bread
and finely-chopped greenstuff, working on to
bran and pollard mash, is the best diet.

Information Sought.
(1) Is it a■ fact that Australia pays Eng-
land £40,000,000 per year interest, and Eng-
land pays only £33,000,000 interest to the
U.S.A. on a much greater debt? (2) Does
the margin of £7,000,000 of our money go to
pay England’s interest to America? —1638.
(1) Presuming that you refer only to
public debts, Australia’s liability for interest
to British bondholders and the British Gov-
ernment as at the end of last year was
approximately £26,500,000 p.a., £1,300,000 of
which was interest on local bodies’ loans.
Under the funding agreement with the United
States Britain is paying approximately
£38,366,600 p.a., which represents 3i p.c.
interest and i p.c. sinking fund. On its
war debt of £81,294,582 due to the Imperial
Government (figures are for June 30, 1930),
Australia pays 6 per cent. —£4 18s. 4d. p.c.
interest and £1 Is. Bd. sinking fund. (2)
There is no margin.
(1) Prospects of the rabbit-skin market,
N.S.W., this winter? (2) Would it be pos-
sible to get a job killing rabbits on a station
on a scalp-bonus basis? —1796.
(1) As far as can be judged at present,
though prices will not be high they will
bo on a payable basis, perhaps from 2s.
per lb. (2) We don’t know of any station-
owners employing people to destroy rabbits
just now, but possibly some work of this
class is available.
How can I rid my garden of couch grass?
—1852.
The surest method is to trench it out.
Get below the root-fibres and the runnel’s and
you will make the job complete. If the
land is to be used immediately for vegetables
or flowers it is not safe to dabble with
poisonous mixtures. If it is to be fallowed,
sodium chlorate (obtainable from chemists)
can be used.
(1) j ßow can I join the merchant marine?
(2) Any educational qualifications, such as
matriculation? (3) How long would it take
to become an officer? (4) Cost of training?
(5) Suitable age at which to go to sea?
—1773.
(1) Apply at shipping offices. (2) No.
Fair education and good health and eyesight
are required. (3), (4), (5) A candidate for
a second-officer’s certificate must be at least
IS, and produce evidence of four years’
sea service as apprentice, cadet midship-
man, boy, seaman (ordinary or A. 8.),
boatswain or carpenter. The exams, for this
certificate involve a thorough knowledge of
trigonometry (plane and spherical). You
should be able to save out of your wages in
your first four years at sea enough to take a
course of navigation and nautical astronomy.
(1) I have lent money in Vic., on first
mortgage, on what seems safe security. The
term has expired. Should I treat it as over-
due or renew it? (2) What is a fair rate
of intei'est on first, second and third mort-
gages respectively? —lB49.
(1) Cannot advise without knowing a lot
more about it, save to suggest that if you
renew you should have a revaluation made.
(2) On sound security seven per cent, is
a fair rate on first mortgage. Second and
third mortgages are better left alone.
(1) Is the N.S.W. Fair Rents Court still
functioning? (2) How could a reduction of
rent for a shop and dwelling be obtainedt
—1784.
(1) Yes. (2) Shops and attached dwell-
ings are excluded from the operation of the
Act.
(1) Can a lad of 18 go into business on
his own account? (2) Would his parents
be liable for his debts? —1783.
(1) He could do so, but should disclose
his age to his creditors, if any. (2) A parent
is not liable for the business debts of a minor
unless responsibility is definitely accepted.
(1) Correct pronunciation of “Achernar
chief star of the constellation Eridanus? (2)
Of “Betelgeuse,” of the constellation Orion?
(3) When is the constellation Cassiopeia
visible in Q’land? —1741.
(1) Ak-er-nar. (2) Be-tel-gooz. (3)

A woman was separated from her husband
26 years ago, and he has paid her £1 per
week during that period. Would it be lawful
for the woman to make a will in favor of
her children, or would her husband be en-
titled to a share in the estate? —l73B.
She could do so, but if the effect would
be to leave her husband without provision for
hi.s maintenance he could apply to the Court
to have provision made for him out of the
estate.
(1) Has Wagner’s “Ring” series of operas
or any portion thereof been professionally
produced in Australia? (2) Have any of
his other operas been produced here? —1813.
(1) Yes. Quinlan’s co. produced the four
operas that form “The Bing” in 1913. (2)
Yes. “Lohengrin” (first produced in 1877),
“Tainnhauser” and “The Flying Dutchman”
(first produced in 1901), “Tristan and Isolde”
(first produced in 1912) and “The Meister-
singers” (first produced in 1913).
A mortgage on my residence is due in three
months. I have been asked to pay the prin-
cipal on due date “or earlier if possible.”
What is my position under the N. 8. Wales
Moratorium Act? —l747.
The mortgagee cannot demand payment of
the principal during the moratorium. The
month fixed for the repayment of the prin-
cipal in the case of a mortgage falling due
between Jan. and Dec. this year is March,
1933.
Was permission given to members of the
A.I.F. to grow beards? —1484.
Yes; oii Lemnos, after Gallipoli.
A Vic. school inspector has a stock ques-
tion. “How many kookaburras does it take
to make a real laugh?” Most children reply
“one,” but the inspector declares that two
are necessary. Is he right? —l62s.
Possibly the examiner has a private defini-
tion of what constitutes a “real laugh.” The
ornithologist at the Australian Museum has
known many a single captive bird to break
into a good laugh. He lias often heard a lone
bird laugh in the bush, but usually in answer
to another some distance away.
Is there a market for the scrub timber
known as “crowsfoot elm” • also for walnut
and pencil cedar? —l6B2.
It is anticipated that crowsfoot elm will
be one of a quantity of N.Q. scrub trees that
will be utilised by a co. in course of flotation,
which expects to mill flooring and lining
boards for the southern markets. Get in
touch with Otto Rosenfeld, of Yungaburra,
who has the matter in hand. Walnut has
a limited market, mostly for export to the
U.S.A. and London. Pencil cedar will pro-
bably come within the scope of the co.
already mentioned.
(1) Qualifications of a civil engine er?
(2) Can a degree be obtained by examines
tions without a full-time Uni. course? (3)
Assuming the candidate has a practical know-
ledge of engineering and a good) technical
education, and is adapted to the profession,
how long would he have to study and what
would be the cost? (4) What opportunities
are there in the profession? (5) Where can
detailed information be obtained? —llsS.
(.1) Qualifications vary according to the
particular branch of civil engineering en-
gaged in. (2) A Uni. degree is not essen-
tial. To obtain one involves at least four
years of day courses. Training can be
obtained through articled pupilage. (3)
Can’t say without knowing the extent of the
“practical knowledge” referred to. (4) Civil
engineers are always in demand. (5) Apply
to any of the Australian Universities.
It is my intention to print fancy-work
transfers from my own designs. What plant
is necessary, and what process, ink, etc., are
used. Where in Q’land is such a plant to
be seen or purchased? —l799.
The plant consists of electrically-driven
perforators, special papers and printing com-
positions and various other gear; it costs
from £lOO to £2OO to instal. The machinery
is not procurable in Australia. Some parts
of the _ process are trade secrets. It might
be advisable for you to send your designs
to a transfer manufacturer, such as B.M.C.
Transfer Co., Spicer Building, Kent and
Druitt streets, Sydney, and T. and A. Faut-
ley and Sons, Colebrook-street, Brunswick,
NlO, Vic., and ask for quotations.
(1) Could a moneylender, before the
N.S.W. Moratorium Act became operative,
charge any interest he liked on a loan on
furniture? (2) In connection with the pur-
chase of a typewriter on the hire-purchase
system, has the purchaser the right to return
the machine if unable to keep up payments?
(3) If a loan on furniture has fallen into
arrears, can a moneylender' in N.S.W. charge
extra interest, and can he seize the furni-
ture?—lB26.
(1) In a sense he could. But the Money-
lenders’ and Infants’ Loans Act (1905) pro-
vides that where a moneylender takes pro-
ceedings for recovery of money lent, and
there is evidence that the interest is ex-
cessive, the Court may relieve the _ person
sued from payment in excess of the interest
found to be fairly due. (2) The vendor
may refuse to accept the return. By the
Moratorium Act if the typewriter was pur-
chased under a hire-purchase agreement, the
Court may readjust the amount of the
instalments and postpone payment. (3)
The chances are that the moratorium would
apply; but these are points on which the
Act, which was passed in a hurry, is not
clear.
(1) To what point back from its mouth
is the Murray River navigable? (2) Where
is the outlet? (3) How far from the Murray
junction is the Murrumbidgee navigable, and
at what point? Total distance from the
mouth of the Murray. (4.) Same informa-
tion regarding the Darling? (5) Are any
books, maps or practical information on the
three rivers mentioned procurable? (6)
Could a boat with an outboard motor be
used on the three rivers? (7) Does the lock-
ing system present any difficulties in progress
on the Murray? —lB9l.
(1) Boats drawing 4ft. Gin. can usually
proceed as far as Yarrawonga, and sometimes
as far as Corowa. Conditions for small boats
are not known, but about 10 miles above
Albury is the Hume weir, which definitely
limits all navigation. (2) Goolwa (S.A.).
(3) For river steamers of 4ft. draught, up to
Hay from June to November. Hay is 242
miles from Murray junction, which is 780
miles from the mouth, or 1022 miles in all.
(4) Depends on rainfall. Boats drawing
sft. 6in. have gone as far as Bourke on floods,
usually June and December. Bourke is 880
miles from the junction of the Murray, which
is 520 miles from the mouth, or 1400 miles
in all. The Darling is navigable to Wil-
cannia (for sft. draught) when river gauge
shows 7ft. at that place, and to Bourke when
the Wilcannia gauge shows 20ft., and then
it depends on the water there is to come
down. Distances: Wentworth to Menindie,
320 miles ; Menindie to Wilcannia, 185 miles ;
Wilcannia to Bourke, 375 miles. (5) Con-
sult Brunsdon Fletcher’s “Murray Valley,”
and in touch with the N.S.W. Govern-
ment Tourist Bureau and the Murray Ship-
ping Co., King William-street, Adelaide.
(6) Yes. It would be most suitable of all
types of craft. (7) Small boats may be
passed through the locks with the river
steamers, if there is room, at the discretion
of the lockmaster, or a lockage may be made
at the end of each hour from 6 a.m. to 6 p.m.
and again at 9 p.m.
What constitutes domicile from a legal
point of view ? I am English and have resided
in Fiji for 15 years, taking a trip to Sydney
every two years. In what circumstances
could my domicile be regarded as Sydney ft —
1618.
“Domicile” means the place or country
which is considered by law to be a person's
permanent home. It may be the. domicile of
origin, which every person occupies at birth,
or be a domicile of choice acquired by the
combination of residence and intention of
permanent or indefinite residence, but not
otherwise. Your domicile of origin was in
England and of choice is in Fiji. You could
acquire a domicile in Sydney only by becom-
ing a resident there either permanently x or
fop a prolonged though indefinite period.
( l)How to cross a goldfinch and a
canary? (2) The best colored mules for
shoio purposes? (3) Any hints regarding
food etc. ? —lBl4.
(1) In the coming breeding season (begin-
ning in June) mate a cock and hen canary
(both buff) from the same nest, and mate
a hen bird from these parents next year
with a young cock goldfinch. Place the
breeding cages in an out-of-the-way corner
where the birds will not be disturbed except
for feeding each morning. Let one person
tend the birds. (2) Clear buff or birds show-
ing even-marked flight feathers. A mule for
show should be kept in a small cage to be-
come accustomed to people. (3) Plain can. i-y
seed, with dainties in the way of hemp, rape
and small sunflower seed, with plenty of
thistle-tops when the young birds appear.
Can (1) privet and (2) olive hedges be
grown from cuttings? (3) Which gives the
best results? (4) Best method of getting
cuttings? (5) Best time for planting? (6)
Best method of preparing ground? —l737.
(1) and (2) Yes. (3) It all depends on
the kind of hedge required. Privet set out
12in. apart will make a thick hedge and can
be trimmed to any height or design; the
olive grows taller, ’to 20ft., and is not so
thick, but has the advantage of bearing fruit
which can be pickled. (4) Set pieces of two-
year-old wood in light loam. (5) When the
sap is rising, from September to November.
(6) Before placing rooted plants in the open
ground, dig the soil deep, since both privet
and olive are heavy feeders. Plant in the
autumn, being careful not to expose the roots
to drying winds, and water liberally till the
plants are established.
(1) What is the best method of budding
roses on their own wood, and the best time to
do it? (2) Does the color of the flower make
any difference in this operation? —lSoo.
(1) Select a limb of last year’s wood in
which there is plenty of sap and cut it
back to about 9in. from the ground. Below
a leaf-stalk on the side away from the direct
rays of the sun make a T-shaped cut through
the bark without injuring the stem, the length
being just sufficient to insert the bud. Cut
the bud from healthy growth deep enough to
get a thin piece of the rosewood of a shield-
like, nature. Lift the bark on the plant with
the knife, and insert the bud, without damag-
ing the bark. A binding of raffia should then
be wrapped round, leaving the eye exposed.
The progress of the growth should be regu-
larly inspected and the binding loosened. In
two to three weeks the union should be
established, and this can be tested by the
freshness or withering of the bud. After the
budding, water the plant regularly to keep
the sap moving. The work can be done up
to the end of February. (2) No.

Synopsis : The story opens in 1905
in the small town of Banton, N. S.
Wales, west of the Blue Mountains,
where Dr. Gherardi, an Italian poli-
tical exile, has settled with his wife
and son, and is establishing a practice.
As yet he does not understand the
people very well, and his difficulties
are increased by the local matron, a
good woman, but incompetent, and by
the fretfulness of his wife, who accom-
panied him to Banton against his
wish, but who now, he feels, is making
no effort to adapt herself to his cir-
cumstances. She bitterly resents his
having lost, in gold-mine speculation,
the money that might have taken them
back to Italy, but when he offers to
send her back and support her there
she will not hear of it. Dr, Gherardi
takes consolation from the thought
that he will not stay in Banton very
long, and his wife tries to accustom
herself to the situation by meeting the
local social leaders, though with little
success. They think of her as a woman
who can’t fit in anywhere. Dr. Gher-
ardi attempts to have necessary re-
forms made at the hospital, but meets
with stolid discouragement. Allega-
tions touching upon his professional
performance and other misunderstand-
ings make him more than ever deter-
mined to leave, but imperceptible influ-
ences work to keep him there. He has
made a friend of John Cartwright,
Banton’s leading citizen, and is slowly
winning the respect and friendship of
others.
Chapter Y ( Continued ).
(3)
LEO was still wary. The disastrous
results of his amiability towards
Amos made him cautious of over-
tures. But he was growing interested
again, despite himself, and the know-
ledge of this made him all the
more vigorous in his attacks. To Teresa
he was increasingly garrulous in his an-
tagonism to the town. She did not at
first realise that re-absorption in his prac-
tice was dictated by any motive save that
of making money, which was the motive
he had given her, a motive which she could
understand and applaud.
Her sanguine state of mind allowed con-
cessions. But- not entertaining, giving
parties. No. Her failure had been too
dismal, too depressing to be voluntarily
repeated. A livid scar was the “evening”
which she had given a few months ago,
as everyone else gave. The musical even-
ing. Fifteen strange people with strange
eyes and tongues, sitting in a semi-circle
in her drawing-room, which seemed by their
very presence to have receded from her and
become terrifyingly unfamiliar. She had
gone, unwillingly, to several of these
musical evenings, and knew all about them.
She was going to let them all sing and play,
one after another, as the custom was. She
had scarcely waited until they had dis-
posed themselves before she had taken her
seat at the piano. Let it be swiftly done
with, this purgatory of noise. Mr. Simpson
had stood beside her, coughing, clearing his
throat. She had tried over the accompani-
ment. Strange and fitful bellows from the
man. She played the last bar and turned
to him. “Yes, I t’ink I can manage. We
will begin now.”
Simpson had stared at her, astonished,
embarrassed. The wash of dutiful applause
from the semi-circle rocked her into flaming
consciousness. That noise, those tentative
bellows, had been the finished production
of Mr. Simpson! Impossible to explain,
to apologise. A crash of chords from her
nervous fingers. She had begun to sing
and, singing, she had forgotten about the
waiting circle. She had not paused for half
an hour, then stopped suddenly, so suddenly
that the laughter and the voices behind her
quavered in the air, broken off short. A
horrible moment. She had closed the lid of
the piano and tried to smile. In a panic
she had brought in supper, elaborate, as
was expected. But it was only nine o’clock;
by ten they had all gone home, their songs
unsung, their musical vanity outraged, and
she had cried stormily, her head on the
table amid the litter of scarcely-tasted
dishes. Leo, who had been visiting a
patient, came back primed for jollity but
was greeted by silence, by the huddled
figure weeping over the supper dishes, by
Dino in pyjamas slowly munching cakes,
his eyes never wavering from his mother’s
downbent head.
No. There could be no more entertain-
ing. But uncertainly, grudgingly, she wanted
to do something to help, to consolidate
Leo’s position.
“A doctor’s wife can do so much to help
her husband in his business, I always
think,” Julia Simpson confided to her, being
tactfully helpful. “I suppose you find that,
Mrs. Gherardi, more than most of us. I’ve
known a man to change his family doctor
simply because the doctor’s wife slighted
his wife in some stupid way. The people
in this town are funny like that. Why—
I wouldn’t say it to everyone, of course—
but I have to be frightfully nice to all
these women whose husbands bank with
Roy. One has to be so democratic, if one
depends on the public for a living.”
Teresa heard her in gloomy silence. Then:
“I am democrat. More, I am socialist.
I was interest in politics because of my
’usband.” The admission, once made,
frightened her. This was one of the things
Leo had told her to refrain from men-
tioning !
“Oh, my dear!” Julia was horrified a.nd
interested. “I don’t mean that sort of
thing! Good heavens! And you look so
harmless!” Of course it was a joke.
Foreigners were always making jokes. Julia
knew what a dreadful thing Socialism was.
Your washerwoman wanting as much as you
had and servants answering back. “I didn’t
mean anything like that. It’s just being
sweet to people and letting them tell you
about their babies. A charming manner
goes such a long way. And I think you
can be charming to everyone, even if their
position isn’t the same as yours, without
losing their respect, don’t you?”
Teresa grunted. The intricacy of the
situation was beyond her. But she was
agreeable when Mona Cartwright asked her
to sing in the benefit concert which was
being arranged for the widow and children
of Sam Baker, who had brought an unspec-
tacular life of parcelling groceries in
Noonan’s Emporium to a most spectacular
close. Sam, wending his way home after
the Saturday late closing, had been led by
Providence to desert his usual track and
take a short cut across the old goldfields.
Providence, jade that she is, hart rewarded
his obedience by pushing him down a shaft.
The concert was the fine flower of Julia’s
democracy. Caste and class were recklessly
sacrificed to the cause. Talent, strangely,
is no respecter of social position, and, un-
deniably, young Ehvood Bailey, a butcher’s
assistant, had the best voice in town. His
rendering of “The Deathless Army” was
so spirited that a local entertainment with-
out it lacked vitality. Mona was the presi-
dent of the women’s branch of the com-
mittee ; Elsie, prominent in the Friendly
Society of the church to which the dead
man had belonged, was treasurer. Julia,
radiantly plundering, secured donations and
offers of assistance even from those most
remotehr touched by Sam’s end, and was
the perfect secretary.
“I think an opportunity like this is rather
a good thing for the town,” she told a
few members of the committee, winningly,
confidingly. “It shows that in essentials
we can forget the little distinctions of class
—if you know what I mean.” Since the
accidental discovery of her ability to grasp
the plan of the social structure, Julia had
been increasingly conscious of the Brother-
hood of Man. Why, it was just an accident
that she was Julia Simpson! She might
just as easily have been poor old Mrs.
Jones, whose fingers were always crinkly
from washing and who couldn’t spell her
own name! “And when we organise a thing
like this benefit concert, it shows that we
do think of the people outside our own
little set. And if we get this Ehvood to
sing, and have the two little Austin children
do the sailors’ hornpipe, it will show exactly
—you know what I mean. These things
and the church societies, where we all
work together, do such a lot of good, I
always think, don’t you?”
They did. And were remarkably grate-
ful, because in being democratic a lot of
trouble would be saved. The dearth of
talent among the “silvertails,” as they were
derisively termed by the clubless and
common, was apparent to them all.
“Of course, it’s different about parties
and dances. One can be quite charming
to people without inviting them to one’s
home. Because, after all, you can’t get any
enjoyment unless you have tastes in com-
mon, can you? And really these people
don’t want to come to our homes.”
Mona, paying an unpremeditated visit
one day, had found seated at Teresa’s
piano a certain Millicent Hutton, a pale,
quiet girl, the daughter of a small store-
keeper. She played the church organ. At
first she had been abashed by Teresa’s invi-
tation, given after an introduction by the
Anglican minister. But the music in her
responded to Teresa’s golden voice, and the
two had spent many hours together.
Making some excuse, the girl had gone
soon after Mona’s arrival. Mona lost no
time.
“My dear, you’ll forgive me, I feel sure.
But strangers coming to the town can’t be
expected to know what I mean i 5....
Where did you meet Miss Hutton, Mrs.
Gherardi?”
“I forget. No. D’ minister of your
church. He tell me about her. He intro-
duce one day. The girl she play very well.
I am intei’est very much in d’ music.”
“Well, of course. It was nice of you to
take an interest in her. But she never goes
anywhere. She’s not quite—quite, how shall
I put it? But you know what I mean.
And in a town like this, one has to be so
careful. We have such a nice little circle.
Not that one’s snobbish. But really, it’s
much more fun if people keep just to
themselves, don’t you think? And Miss
Hutton goes with quite a different set of
people.”
Teresa had been utterly bewildered. “You
mean she is not a lady?” she asked bluntly.
“Oh, I wouldn’t say that. She seems a
nice, quiet girl. Quite well educated. Of
course I’ve only met her through church
work.”
“She knows very well the music. The
first I find in d’ town. She read Foggaz-
zaro and Serao. She know a little of Italian
and French literature. I t’ink she is very
nice girl.”
“Of course. I mean she just isn’t in our
set.”
It seemed hopeless to bring any light of
conviction to those stolid black eyes, that
gloomy, strangely dogged face, but Mona
had done her best. Haltingly she had tried
to explain the irregular rulings of Banton
society. It was not born of occupation.
Mrs. Reb Mullins’s husband kept a store.
She belonged to the set; he went shooting
with John and Macpherson; he was on
the hospital committee and a patron of the
Jockey Club. Edward Hutton kept a store
and his daughter was not in the set and
her father did not go shooting with John.
But the black eyes, mockingly, mutely
asked for a reason behind all this. Thus
compelled, Mona realised that there was
no reason behind the fabric of the town’s
cliques. There were no definite qualifica-
tions for admittance. Either you “be-
longed” or you did not “belong.” It was
not a question of wealth. Old Peter Willis
and his family surged in outer darkness,
though Peter owned half the property on
Main-street. Yet a bank clerk, whose en-
tire weekly income would clothe itself in
a spotted tie and a pair of fancy socks,
was permitted, encouraged, to whisk his
cut-away coat tails through the gates of
Paradise. Least of all was lineage con-
sidered.
Routed by reason, Mona had fallen back
on dogmatism. “That’s just the way it is.
Probably it’s stupid. But you’ve got to
draw a line. And the other people in the
town are perfectly satisfied. They don’t
want to be intimate with us any more than
we with them.” Why trouble to explain
to the woman, anyhow, she had thought, a
trifle sulkily. If she didn’t know what was
due to her position as the wife of the
doctor, and wanted to take up with every
Tom, Dick and Harry, let her. Of course
she was a foreigner. And foreigners, when
one came to think of it, were rather ex-
treme people.
But Mona was not altogether a fool. She
had gone home rather thoughtfully; and
that night had astonished her husband.
“You know, John, we’re rather stupid
about our tuppeny little ‘'society.’ We
take it so seriously. And it’s just silly
pretension, after all.”
John had regarded her in quiet amaze.
“I’m glad you’ve the sense to realise it,”
he said briefly.
Realisation was as far as Mona went.
She had none of the instincts of the
reformer. She was able to forget that dis-
concerting moment of revelation quickly
and comfortably. Even, as a tacit apology
for her momentary backsliding, and to con-
firm her comfortable allegiance to the Gods
of Things as They Are, she communicated
to her friends the slightly queer notions of
Mrs. Gherardi. Julia buttressed her state-
ments, adding, with quite enchanting fervor:
“She’s really a dear, though. Of course
she was only joking when she said that
about Socialism. But Ido agree with Mona
that she ought to be more careful whom
she entertains. Of course we understand,
but some people mightn’t.”

Teresa, dressing for the concert, felt a
faint, half-apologetic glow of anticipation
until, by a casual upward glance, she saw
the laughing faces in the Conservatorium
group.
Caterina was singing that month in
Buenos Ayres. Laura wrote ecstatically that
she had an engagement for the season in
Madrid. Emilia was in Paris. And she,
Teresa, was to make her first public appear-
ance to-night at a benefit concert for the
widow of Sam Baker, in Banton!
“Mother of God!” said Teresa wildly.
Leo came to the door.
“I thought I heard you call,” he said.
His face was kind, commiserating. He
betrayed no surprise when she flung her-
self into his arms and embraced him chok-
ingly.
“Leo! Leo! This is my triumph! Leo!
My first public appearance as a singer!”
Her voice broke, shattered by tears.
He caressed her bare shoulder, put his
lips to the brave little curls.
“Poor little one! Don’t! Don’t! I
guessed how you would feel. Try not to
think of it like this, Teresa. We do this
together for one another. Don’t think I
don’t feel, every day, what you feel to-
night. Every time I visit a patient I
think of the big things I should be doing.
And then I say to myself, what are these
big things? I might make some discovery.
I might not. Meanwhile it is not such a
bad thing to help these people and to cure
their pain. And you—you would give
happiness to more people were you singing
in a.big opera house, but perhaps you would
not give more happiness.” The dull ache at
his heart told him that he was convincing
neither her nor himself.
He put her from him gently. “You must
dress, Teresa.. It is late. You must go
through with this now. You have promised.
Try to think of it as amusing. Some-
where in all this there is a joke.”
Abruptly she withdrew from his arms
and went across to the bed where her frock
lay, ready. She caught it up, checked the
involuntary move to put it on and crushed
the braided silk in her hands fiercely,
viciously, as if it were some live thing she
was worrying.

EACH WEEK, ate, and their friends overseas, too !
Leo turned, without speaking, and went
from the room. When she came out to
him she w'as dressed and seemed recovered.
Only her eyes, with their black, dilated
pupils, gave evidence of her distress.
“I—l think I could bear it better, if
you didn’t come down. Would you mind,
Leo?”
“No,” he said kindly. “I won’t come.
I will take you down to the hall. I have
a patient to visit.”
He left her at the hall and strode through
the dark streets. His heart bled for her
and he cursed his own impotence. He
should never have married her. It was
supreme selfishness. Better to have hurt
her on that far-away day when she begged
so passionately to come with him. Mar-
riage with him, the sharing of his exile,
seemed imminently desirable to her then.
But how could she tell that it would lead
her to this night, and the nights that had
been, and still must be? By now she
would have been the great singer she could
have been. And he, too—he would have
been infinitely better without her. He had
known that, even then. But he had been
afraid, for a moment, to face the future
alone. The moment had passed and he
had swiftly recognised reality and found his
courage. But it had been too late. The
damage had been done. Now they must
go on, of course. Meanwhile there was this
man to be seen.... Poor girl!
Teresa sat on an end of a wooden bench
which ran along the wall in the wings of
the small stage. With scornful eyes she
watched the fervid efforts of the young
Austins, their heel taps, their pulling of
imaginary ropes, their delirious abandon
impossible to sailor on sea or land. Round
and round they went frenziedly. The music
reached a furious tempo, the young Austins
climbed invisible spars (one fancied their
ship rounding the Horn in a titanic gale).
Their sailor caps bobbed frantically. The
music stopped. The Austins bowed. The
hall rocked with applause.
Miss Elphinstone, long and angular,
settled her glasses on her thin nose, adjusted
the sad flounces of her gown, knocked over
Mr. Connelly’s violin stand, which was in
readiness for his “item,” and swept on to
the stage with the aplomb of one whose
rightful place is behind the footlights, one
who had actually been asked to consider a
position with a touring concert company.
The exigencies of an ailing mother had de-
barred the “profession,” but by reason of
that offer, made twenty years ago, Miss
Elphinstone lived and would probably die
convinced that she had sacrificed a brilliant
career to filial devotion.
“I couldn’t leave mother. After all,
the knowledge of having done one’s duty
is a greater satisfaction than the hollowness
of fame!” She would sigh, and the listener
would be admiring, or bored, according to
the number of times she had heard the
details of Miss Elphinstone’s sacrifice.
“And do you know,” she would confide.
“I think—at least people tell me—that the
quality in my voice which touches people
comes from the sacrifice I’ve made.” And
her pale eyes would stare into space.
Now, as her quavering soprano implored
the audience to “dry those tears,” the
“quality” was manifest in a sobbing intake
of rather short breath, and the thin Miss
Elphinstone had her little hour. Her roll
of music was pressed convulsively to her flat
breast, or flung away as if it scorched her.
Teresa, listening to the burst of applause
which greeted the final, cracked note, tasted
the bitterness of overwhelming defeat. She
stared gloomily at the incessantly bowing
figure of Miss Elphinstone. She began to
feel a little dizzy.
“You’re in good voice to-night, Miss
Elphinstone.” That was the man Mac-
pherson, Leo’s friend. Soon he would sing,
all these people with their ridiculously
rouged faces and their excitement disguised
under nonchalance, and their foolish,
assumed familiarity with “back-stage.”
As one item succeeded another, Teresa’s
nerves were strained, and on them vibrated
every discordancy. Helpless, silent, she sat
on the edge of the form. Julia, airily stage-
managing, stayed for a gracious moment,
squeezing the rigid arm.
“How wonderful of you, Mrs. Gherardi.
You aren’t the least bit nervous! Poor
Maisie Bailey is almost in hysterics.
Really it’s pitiful. Though I’d die—l’d
simply die—if I had to go on before all
those people, though the audience is won-
derful, isn’t it? If I let everybody take
the encores we’d be here all night.”
That handful of white faces, the un-
covered joists of the roof, the corrugated-
iron walls, the tiny wail of the piano! Miss
Elphinstone squeezing in beside her,
fingering the bouquet of flowers tied with
royal blue ribbon!
“Life has its compensations, hasn’t it,
Mrs. Gherardi?” Miss Elphinstone was
saying softly, soulfully. Teresa did not
understand and made no reply.
“We are looking forward to hearing you
sing; Mrs. Simpson told me you’d thought
of going on the stage once. I think that’s
so interesting.” Exquisite condescension.
“No talking, please. They’ll hear you
down below.”
Miss Elphinstone sniffed. “When Mr.
Lowe has been on a concert platform as
often as I have he’ll know how loudly
one can speak without being heard by the
audience. You know, Mrs. Gherardi, we
have something in common. I suppose
they’ve told you that I intended going on
the stage myself? I had a splendid offer.”
“Ready, Elwood?” |
Elwood, round and redfaced, trampedj
into the arena. The piano crashed.
Firm, pugnacious as a bull-calf, Elwood,
with the confidence of oft-repeated success,
proclaimed the valor of “The Deathless
Army.”
“Yes. There’s real feeling in his voice.
Of course he must live and know sorrow.
And then everything depends on Fate.
Look at us, Mrs. Gherardi. Probably we 1
two have more talent than that boy, yet
Fate decreed that Fame was not to be ours.
But in giving up Fame I sometimes think
one gets something more precious.”
From that whispering, interspersed with
forgetful loudness, Teresa gathered that the
sacred, bitter-sweet garden of her lost
dreams was being invaded by this woman,
this thin, terrible old woman with her
screeching. More, she was daring to claim
with her the comradeship of the defeated!
The last black drop filled the cup to
overflowing. Pale as death, her heart pound-
ing against her ribs, she got up without
speaking and stalked across to Julia, who
was whisperingly concerned with Miss
Bailey’s Scotch-reel.
“Mrs. Simpson, please could I speak wit’
you?” Teresa pressed one beringed little
hand to her heaving breast. Her eyes were
wide and dark, the pupils unnaturally
dilated. “I am sorry. I must ask to excuse.
I cannot sing. I must go home.”
Julia turned dismayed.
“Oh, but, Mrs. Gherardi, you must!
Whatever’s happened? Don’t you feel well?”
“I am sorry. I must ask to excuse. Will
you be so good?”
Julia looked imploringly at her husband.
“Would you like a drink of water?”
she said helplessly. “I’m so sorry you’re
not feeling well. If you could just sing
once. We could send you on straight after
Elwood if you think you could.”
They would send her on after that—that
lout who roared out there! Send her to
the audience which was bemused, hushed,
spellbound by such a one! Why pretend?
They were clustering round her, anxious,
sympathetic for her illness. What did she
care for them? Fate gave her this, and to
Emilia it gave Madrid, to Laura the Paris
Opera House. The Oddfellows’ Hall and
Sam Baker’s benefit! No! No! No! Why
not hurt them? To the Devil with Fate!
“I am not sick. But I must ask to excuse.
I do not wish to sing. I will not sing wit’
—dese barbarians!”
The sympathetic faces circled round her
receded, became blurred, and she was not
conscious of the shocked distaste which
replaced sympathy.
Julia for once could not find anything to
say. Alan Simpson cleared his throat. The
'“Deathless Army” was almost defunct, and
its death-rattle was smashingly loud.
“Well, if that’s how you feel, Mrs. Gher-
ardi, of course” There was no time for
more. Teresa, unnoticed, stood there fight-
ing off faintness. A group in a corner whis-
pered together, and cast glances in her direc-
tion. She groped her way to the door at
the back of the stage, opened it and passed
down the rickety wooden steps, clinging to
the rail because revolt had had a weakening
effect on her legs.
She picked her way through the litter
of rubbish which had been left strewn about
when the dressing-rooms had been cleaned.
Down the left side of the hall a narrow
alleyway led from the back yard to the
street. She was home in five minutes.
In the year which followed she looked
back on Leo’s sympathy, the love and
tender understanding he gave her that night,
as the last of his loyalty.
She sold the piano.
A few days after the concert she went
down to Ern Maple’s Furniture Exchange.
Ern noticed her pale face and told his wife
later that the doctor’s wife was a sick-
lookin’ woman. He inspected the piano,
offered her twenty pounds for the instru-
ment that had cost a hundred, and in due
course two men hauled it on to a waggon,
and an empty wall-space was the grave of
Teresa’s musical hopes.
Leo knew nothing of the transaction until
he saw that the piano was gone.
“I sold it,” Teresa said sullenly. “What
is the use of keeping it? I shall never sing
again. Not in this country.”
“You are mad!” Leo shrugged his
shoulders. “E<ut do what you like.” The
scandal of her refusal to sing at the concert
was disturbing the town. The pity which
he had felt was dissipated by the pin-prick-
ings of gossip so busily concerned with her.
Even Julia was outraged. It was hypocrisy.
One could forgive anything except hypoc-
risy, Julia maintained. Mrs. Gherardi had
pretended to be so democratic, and all the
time- she was an utter snob. Why hadn’t
she spoken out in the first place? She
knew that the concert would be—well, a
mixed affair. She must have known that,
unless she was completely stupid. And she
had been quite agreeable; then, when the
time came, had behaved so outrageously.
Really, she had nothing to be snobbish
about. Obviously she wasn’t a lady. No
lady would behave that way—hurting
people’s feelings so terribly. Poor Miss
Elphinstone, who was quite nice and lady-
like even if she wasn’t in their set, had
just cried and cried. Mrs. Austin didn’t
want to let the children go on for their
second item, the Irish Jig. She said she
hadn’t brought them there to be insulted.
All this trouble after they’d been so tactful.

SPORTING
NOTIONS
Under the Whip
The 1931 Newmarket Handicap provided
one of the most exciting finishes on record.
Starting at 16 to 1, Parkwood just scrambled
home in advance of Waterline (33 to 1),
with Mollison (20 to 1) only a neck farther
off. Parkwood is a year older than Molli-
son ; each was the champion juvenile of his
year but a failure in the three-year-old
classics. Parkwood used to be raced by Clive
Baillieu and W. S. Robinson. He now runs
in the nomination of Robinson only. All
along he has been in the Caulfield stable of
Frank Musgrave, who in 1916 captured the
Newmarket Handicap with Amata. Amata’s
half-sister, Yoorala, produced Parkwood as
the result of a union with the 1924 Melbourne
Cup hero, Backwood (imp.). Clive Baillieu
owned Backwood in conjunction with two
English sportsmen, William Clark and A. D.
Hughes, and with E.L., one of his brothers,
he bred Amata and Yoorala, having imported
the dam, Carissima (by Ladas), from the
Old Land. So from all angles the Baillieus
were associated with Parkwood’s triumph.
With First Arrow favorite at 7 to 1, sub-
stantial odds were obtainable about other
Newmarket aspirants. Mystic Peak and tiie
Sydney prad Holdfast commanded a lot of
support, while Taurus and Merab (from
South Aus.) and Spanish Galleon also were
preferred to Parkwood. Adam Skirving,
the trainer, refused to believe that Water-
line had done his best at Caulfield. All
through the Flemington race Waterline was
travelling well. At the members’ stand he
was about half a neck behind Parkwood. The
latter shifted out near the finish, and Water-
line nearly pipped him; a jockey like
Neville Percival might have got Waterline
home. First Arrow had undisputed occupancy
of the “Malua” track (outer rails), but did
not settle down to earnest galloping until it
was too late. Mystic Peak ran a splendid
fourth, and is developing into a topnotcher.
Greenline improved on recent Melbourne dis-
plays, and, despite the 10.7, looked like being
in the money at one stage. Tindall, who has
moved the whole of his racing string from
Sydney to Melbourne, went close to a killing
with the newly-acquired Mollison.
Jim Pike, never rode a finer race than he
did on Bold Bid in the Sires’ Produce Stakes.
Both C. B. Kellow and James Scobie, who
trains the Heroic colt for Kellow, -were afraid
that Bold Bid would not see out seven fur-
longs. Pike took his mount to the front and
slowed down the field in a judicious degree.
He allowed Auto Pay to gain a slight lead
two furlongs from home, and then called up
the reserve energy in Bold Bid, who wore
down Auto Pay but could not withstand a
late challenge from Mulcra, a 10-to-l chance.
Mulcra is by the Caulfield Cup winner Violon-
cello from Sextia, by The Welkin. He is
trained by Claude Goodfellow* for “Les
Hilton,” who used to be prominently asso-
ciated with trotting in Victoria. Stephen dis-
appointed A. P. Wade as greatly as First
Arrow had done in the Newmarket. Money
was piled on the Top Gallant colt, who
actually touched 6 to 4, but went out at a
trifle longer price.
Ned Moss well deserved to win the V.R.C.
St. Leger with Veilmond. For many years he
has been striving for a classic success. Veil-
mond disappointed him in the spring, but
on Saturday the Limond colt had his revenge
on Balloon King, who vanquished him in
the Victoria Derby. Backers of Veilmond
again had to lay the odds. This time they
were not left lamenting. Pike made the run-
ning on Balloon King, with Veilmond handy.
McCarten called on Veilmond opposite the
members’ stand, and a keen finish was fought,
the favorite prevailing by half a length.
Carry On came home really well, and this
Magpie filly, who is a stable-companion of
Veilmond, should worthily represent George
Price in the Australian Cup.
To have a chance in the Australian Cup,
Glare will need to improve vastly on his
Fssendon Stakes showing. Of course he was
never expected to down Phar Lap, but he
should not have been beaten by commoners
like Lamiira and Mira Donna at a difference
of only a few pounds in weight. Saturday’s
form at Flemington speaks best for Lampra,
Nadean, Induna, St. Mary and Carry On as
candidates for the 2 1 miles handicap. The
manner in which Induna was supported for
the Brunswick Stakes was astonishing, after
his conspicuous failure in the V.A.T.C. Wood-
cliff Handicap. The two displays are diffi-
cult to reconcile. At Flemington the Adel-
aide colt was on the spot throughout. He
seemed “home and dry” a furlong from the
judge, but tired when challenged by St. Mary,
who scored by a length and a half. Nadeau,
last year’s Australian Cup winner, finished
only an eyebrow behind Induna, the places
being wholly filled by S.A. prads. Nadeau
is a true-blue stayer, and, having apparently
come back to her best form, may register
another important autumn victory.
Further selections for Flemington:—
Australian Cup; Nadean, 1; Induna, 2;
Lampra, 3.
Leonard Stakes : Mollison ; next, Hathalm.
C. M. Lloyd Stakes: Thar Lap; next,
Mystic Peak.
Ascot Vale Stakes : Bold Bid; next, Gynot-
tar.

Ridden by a little-known jockey, and any
price in the betting, Pavilion ran a sterling
second to Ticino (6 to 1) in the Dundas
Handicap at Rosehill. And now many more
punters are of opinion that this admirable
mare will capture the Doncaster as well as
the Challenge Stakes, as did Venetian Lady,
also’ a chestnut from E. F. Walker’s Rand-
wick stable, last year. Ticino had a 71b.
allowance for being piloted by an apprentice,
Williams. That brought his weight to 7st.
61b., 41b. less than in the Doncaster; Pavi-
lion carried Sst. 131 b., and 41b. will come
off her back on Easter Saturday. All the same,
Ticino is so well bred (he is by Valais —

direct my aim?”

Pereskia) and so thoro’uglily seasoned a five-
year-old that he must be considered for the
A.J.C.’s mile handicap. After winning a
seven-furlong handicap for three- and four-
year-olds at Rosehill, where he is trained
by Booth (Phar Lap and Nightmarcli were
among the starters), he was put away for a
long spell, with obviously good results.
Panola was favorite for Ticino’s race;
she was third, and Lord Romeo, the second
favorite, was fourth. The others, 14 of
them, headed by Troilus (an early winner),
were sprung out for a hundred yards m- so.
Tliree-year-olds continue to score in open
company. Truest (5 to 1), trained by Joe
Cook at Ilandwick for newspaper knight
Denison, landed the February Handicap like
a good one. John Buchan was a warm favo-
rite, and he looked all over a winner when
he hit the front at the Legcr, but there is
not much fight in this imported horse, and
the filly fairly worried him out of it, old
Donald getting the better of a tussle with
Crucis (looking nice and bright again) for
third place. Truest is a natty chestnut by
Treclare, sire of Tregilla, out of Guest. Tre-
gilla had an exercise gallop in the Dundas
Handicap. Judging by his appearance, he
will need a lot more work if lie is to prove
superb"- to Veilmond again.
Weiss, William Kelso's apprentice, rode
quite a good finish on Truest, and Kelso
saddled up a winner himself in Alpen (<
to 1), another useful three-year-old, in the
second division of the Flying Welter. Alpen,
who is by Valais —Eulita, came with a
finishing run which was to’o fast for the
favorite, Bonawe, and Kilumirri (8 to 1),
and may be worth following. Kilumirri also
shaped as if success will come his way pre-

“Retired Urger”: The racing heads of
N. S. Wales stopped another paralysing punch
when Premier Lang announced last week-end
that he was going to ban mid-week racing
and confine meetings to Saturdays and public
holidays. Details are lacking, but if the
matter cannot be arranged by agreement
with the clubs concerned legislation to en-
force the prohibition will be enacted. The
move will practically wipe out pony racing.
A.J.C. programmes will also be interfered
with, and re-adjustment at this late stage
for the Easter meeting will be full of diffi-
culty. Another Lang ukase is that the
amount staked is to be exempt from the
tax on winning bets; but big punters who
book their wagers and small fry who pat-
ronise s.-p. shops will still dodge the tax.

“Nasik”: Victor Sassoon (B. 18/2/’3l)
has other good horses in his string besides
the winner of the Indian Eclipse Stakes.
One is Star of Italy, who has cleaned up
all the big races in India, including two
Viceroy’s Cups and the King-Emperor’s
Cup, for the past couple of seasons. Star
of Italy is by Sunstar and did little before
coming to India. Sassoon’s trainer is Hoyt,
from Australia. Other Australian trainers
with big strings in India are Robinson and
Iliggins, while there are at least a dozen Aus-
tralian riders in good demand. Sassoon
races in England and has a few horses at
Flemington under the wing of Lambert,
though the blue and gold cold's have not
been seen to great advantage as yet in this
country.
M.Q. (and Rafferty) Rules
Billy Grime, who held three Australian
championships when he visited America in
1927, regained the lightweight title by out-
pointing Billy Jones at Leichhardt last
Friday night. It* was the first time Grime
(9st. 91b.) had attempted to recover any of
the titles he lost by default, and the early
rounds saw him grab often after landing
a blow. Jones (9st. 7ilb.) was weak at his
weight-—he is normally a 10-stoner. Grime’s
brisk finish earned him a popular points
decision.
* * * *
The standard of the fights staged at Syd-
ney Stadium has been falling from week to
week, and zero was approached last Satur-
day night, when three 10-rounders failed
to furnish one real mill. Bob Thornton
(list. 21b.) met Doug Lisson (list. 61b.)
in the main event. It had taken Thornton
only three rounds to stop Lisson about two
months back, and he did the same thing
this time. Young Heeney (Sst. 121 b.) hit
Jimmy Summers (Bst. 121 b.) more often
than he himself was walloped, but Summers
was declared winner. Ern Evans (Sst. Gib.)
outpointed Tiny Wayne (Bst. 841 b.).
**=!=*
“Plug Ugly”: It is a matter for wonder-
ment to many how the kings of the boxing-
ring get the names so many of them bear,
names obviously alien to their origins. Jack
Sharkey’s real name, for instance, is some-
thing from Eastern Europe and made up
mostly of the harsher consonants, and there
are many others. A story of that fine light-
heavyweiglit, the late Stanley Ketchell may
explain matters to some extent. On his
first fight with Louis Tracy, the announcer,
familiar with Tracy, asked the youngster as
he came into the ring what his name was.
“Stanislaus Kieeal,” was the reply. The
spruiker turned to the spectators. “On my
right, gemmem, Kid Tracy; on my left
Stanley Ketchell,” and that was that.
The Ins and Outs
The West Indians showed something like
their overseas form in the final Test
match in Sydney. Opening on a good
wicket, the Buccaneers had 299 up at the
end of the first day for two wickets. Roach
(31) was the first to go; Martin and Head-
ley then settled down to fast and attrac-
tive cricket, taking the score to 222 before
Ileadley was out l.b.w. to McCabe for 105.
Martin continued to play watchful yet
interesting cricket, and, aided by skipper
Grant, who spanked the tired bowling in
correct fashion, was 100 n.o. at stumps, witii
his captain 48 n.o. The bowlers w’ere well
mastered, only McCabe appearing to present
any difficulty. The innings was resumed
on Saturday on a wicket drying after the
morning’s rain. Grant finished with an
invaluable knock of 62, and Ironmonger and
Grimmett quickly got rid of Sealy, Con-
stantine and Bartlett on the tricky pitch,
Martin remaining n.o. with 123. Grant de-
clared at 350 for 6 wickets. Australia
early met trouble, Ponsford being o'ut for 7.
Woodfull and Bradman carried the score to
66, when the latter went for 43. Kippax
and Rigg followed in short order, and then
Woodfull (22) lost his wicket, when an
appeal against the light succeeded with 5
down for 89. Thanks largely to Fairfax
(54) and Oldfield (36), the total was raised
to 224 on Monday; Francis (4 for 48) was
the best of the bowlers.
* * * *
“Umgeni”: The final Test between Eng-
land and South Africa at Durban was
marked by a curious happening. When the
players came out it was found that the bails
were too long, making the stumps 94 inches
wide instead of the regulation 9in.; and the
entire stock on the ground was outsize.
There was no time to hunt round Durban
for the legal variety, so those in hand were
cut down and play started 30 minutes late.
The wicket, on which the South Africans
were to, bat, was very sticky at the time due
for starting the match. Half an hour under
a hot sun saw it dry tcf easiness, and Chap-
man, who had sent the South Africans in,
saw himself deprived of his advantage
through no fault of his own.

The Ins and Outs
Though South Australia comfortably wal-
loped Victoria on the first innings, getting home
by 285 runs, the Cabbage Gardeners retained
their hold of the Sheffield Shield on points.
Woodfull’s 177 was the outstanding feature
of the Victorian first innings of 369, and he
was well helped with a dashing 73 by Oakley,
Grimmett and Lee dividing the wickets.
Ironmonger was again dn top in S.A.’s
second try, getting 5 for 60 in a total of
134, or 13 for 195 in the match. Victoria’s
final essay yielded 131 for 4 wickets, Jack
Ryder notching 48 n.o. The season ended
with Victoria again On top with 16 points.
N.S.W. (15), Queensland (13) and South
Australia (9) follow in that order.
* * * *
A review of the Sheffield Shield season
does not induce much encouragement for fol-
lowers of Australian cricket. New batsmen
have been coming forward —literally by the
dozen—but not olie new bowler of promise
has swung into our ken, though, perhaps,
Hunt, the N.S.W. lefthander, may be
excepted. Bradman heads the batting aver-
ages with 115.83 for 6 completed innings.
Woodfull is also over the three-figure mark
with 103.5. Thompson’s 79.16 is Queens-
land’s best effo'rt, while the promising Loner-
gan tops the South Australian list with 60
runs for 6 completed knocks. The leading
bowlers, unhappily, are all long in the tooth.
Ironmonger took 27 wickets for Victoria at
a cost of 15,2 each, and his fellow-ancient,
Blackie, was close behind with 24 averaging
16.4. Hunt made the best showing for
N.S.W. —24 at 18.42. Two more ancients
in Grimmett and Ron Oxenliam led the field
for S. Australia and Queensland respectively.
Grimmett’s 19 wickets cost 18.5 runs a time,
and Oxenham’s 24, 15.87. Altogether it
looks as if the old brigade will be our only
hope against the formidable Sotith Africans
next season.
* * * *
South Africa has had all the best of the
argument with Chapman’s followers in the
Test series just completed in Afrikander-
dom. The fifth and final game was played
at Durban on a turf wicket, and the locals
were able to hold their visitors to a draw.
Since they had scored the only win recorded
in the previous games the parsley crown was
theirs.. Peebles was troublesome in South
Africa’s first shot, which ended at 252. The
Rooineks went in greatly bucked, only to
flop for 230, lefthander Vincent taking 6
for 51. Africa closed at 219 for 7 in the
second go, and left Britain with 242 to win,
and an hour to make the runs. Four wicsets
had gone for 72 at stumps.
* * * *
“Aigburth”: One of the star turns of the
fifth Test between England and South Africa
was the ’keeping of W. Farrimond, England’s
second stumper and an unknown to most
Australians. The current Lillywliite places
him as a member of the Lancashire second
eleven last season, and in addition to his
keeping he must be a useful batsman, for
he is third in the second averages with 35.88
for 9 completed innings.
* - a * * *
“Der Jong”: South Africa has selected
15 men, with a manager, to invade Australia
at the beginning of next cricket season. On
the form shown against England the visitors
will prove a tough proposition. Nupen, one
of the most successful bowlers on matting, is
omitted, but there are seven regular bowlers,
including two left-handers, varying from
the fast-medium Morkel to Balaskas, the
Greek from Kimberley, who is a googlyite.
The batting, headed by H. W. Taylor, still
in the first flight of the world’s batsmen,
is very strong, while the fielding, as it
always is with the Afrikanders, is top
hole. The skipper is 11. B. Cameron, who
is a sound batsman and a ’keeper of the
first water. He plays with the Transvaal
and made a great impression in England
during the South Africans’ tour in 1929.
* * * *
West Indies scored a most meritorious
victory against N.S.W. in their last match
hut one in Australia. With 339 up for their
first knock, the visitors got the opposition
hack in the pavilion for 190, Constantine
taking 6 for 45 on a perfect wicket (Bill 41).
The Buccaneers did even better in their
second essay, closing with 403 on for 9
wickets.. Martin again played a solid open-
ing innings for 56, and though Roach and
Headley failed, Sealy contributed a delight-
ful 92; lie was partnered by Constantine,
who was run out at the same figure.
This, time Con. showed us that he is a
classic batsman, as opposed to a mere hitter,
when he chooses. A ninth-wicket stand by
Barrow (45) and Scott (67 n. 0.) served to
emphasise the poverty of the N.S.W. attack.
N.S.W. made, a gallant try for the 553 runs
required to win, hoisting 466 of them. Brad-
man (73),Kippax (141) and McCabe (100)
battled hard, but, though Constantine was
not. bowled more than two overs in this
innings, the issue was never in doubt, the
visitors winning by 86 runs.
* * * sjs
“Old Q.”: After the recent turmoil a
spirit of sweet reasonableness seems to
possess the Q.C.A. A committee has
been appointed to review the association’s
constitution, this arising out of the past
season’s Donnybrook, and has invited Leo
O’Connor, for long captain of Queensland, to
a seat on the body. Considering that
O’Connor was chased out of the Queensland
side, this sudden change of heart is touching.
Racquet and Bawl
“Top Spin”: Having the prospect of a
meeting with Tilden and cd. in his mind’s
eye, J. O. Anderson has been playing
more match tennis than for some time.
Queensland wants him to pay a visit to
Brisbane for an exhibition series and pro-
bably one or two matches with local ama-
teurs, provided the consent of the Aus-
tralian authorities can be obtained. As an
amateur J.O. was a popular figure in Queens-
land in the past, and it is nearly three years
now since his last trip to the banana coun-
try. On that occasion he njet E. F. Moon
in one of his nasty moods, and to the aston-
ishment of everyone went down flop before
the lathy Queensland farmer.
“Ivooyong” : The Australian tennis autho-
rities, notoriously varra canny wi’ t’ brass,
got a shock the other day. Recently they
put through a rule allowing entrants for the
Australian championships travelling expenses
from their homes to the convincing ground
and return. One of the entrants is Emily Hood,
the mercurial Queenslander who took the
Sydney and Melbourne tennis worlds by
storm a couple of years ago. Now Mrs.
Westacott, she lives a thousand miles north
of Brisbane! What the Australian heads
said when the awful news was broken to
them will certainly never be recorded in the
minute-book.
* * * *
“Centre Court”: Isn’t it about time the
English tennis authorities shifted the
Wimbledon meeting for the All England
championships to some more spacious
pleasaunce—say, Newmarket Heath? For
the umpteenth year in succession many
thousands of pounds forwarded by appli-
cants for tickets for the champion-
ships have had to be returned, since there
is insufficient seating or breathing space
for a quarter of them. This time
the returning money is just short of £30,000,
a sum the very mention of which should
turn the Australian tennis bosses, always
anxiously counting the scanty store in the
toe of the stocking, green with envy.
The Nineteenth Hole
“Brassey”: Tasmania is not so slow as
mainland carpers would have us suppose.
The Apple Isle is the first to complete its
tourney to decide on a representative for
the golf matches On which the choice of the
Australian starter for the British open cham-
pionship will depend. The winner turned up in
young W. B. Robertson, of Kingston Beach
club, and he gained the victory at the expense
of his own father, who was his opponent in
the final. “Old Jock” beat Rufus Stewart
for the Australian professional title in Mel-
bourne last year, so his offspring must be
hot stuff, as his card of 288 for 70 holes on
this occasion indicates. The tournaments
are in full swing in most of the States.
* * * #
“Old Q.”: Having once made a start on
the municipal links at Victoria Park, Bris-
bane Council is getting well down to the
job, with the result that play should be
possible before long. Motor rollers and
mowers are being purchased as well as hand-
power mowers for the greens, and appli-
cations for a professional are to be shortly
invited. Few golf courses in Australia are
so accessible from the heart of the city as
this, and it should prove a notable addition
to the social amenities of Bananalands
capital, to say nothing of helping citizens
to improve their vocabularies.
* * * *
“Mid Irdn”: The American golfers “Wild
Bill” Melhorn and R. Cruickshank should
soon be in our midst. “Wild Bill” is noted
for his length off the tees. On occasion he
loses all sense of direction, but, all the same,
he is generally well up when the whips are
cracking. Cruickshank is in direct con-
trast to his partner, being quiet and un-
emotional. He is a noted hand with the iron
clubs, and is rated one of the best short-
game players in America.
s!s
“Brassey”: A curious tale comes from
Yankeeland. A player in a Californian
tourney returned a false score in the elimi-
nating round and thus won into the match-
play stages of the championship. Carpeted,
lie owned up, but to avoid scandal was
allowed to continue on the condition that he
ran a bye in his first match, and so became
automatically out of it all. He lost the
match, but not before he deliberately spilt
the “scandal” by doing his darnedest to
wreck liis opponent’s game while all the
time making it as evident as possible to the
large crowd that he was deliberately throw-
ing away the match.
:!: * * *
“The McHaggis”: The world of golf was
staggered to its boot heels the other day
when the German Golf Association an-
nounced that it proposed to provisionally
abolish the stymie off its own bat. The
new rule will be tried for a year in all play,
including the championship events. The fact
that such a revolutionary step should have
been taken without so much as asking St.
Andrews’ “by your leave” will cause much
shaking of heads, but it cannot be denied
that the abolition of the traditional anomaly
which applies in one form of the game while
it does not in the other will he generally
well received. St. Andrews, which has
already bowed to modern tendencies and
permitted the use of the loug-banned steel
shaft, might do worse than fall into line
with Germany and run the blue pencil
through the stymie.
:!= * * *
“Joss”: Some of the overseas golfing
journals have recently been holding a dis-
cussion on what the Americans call “jinx”
holes, -which exercise a fatal influence over
certain players. The hole that invariably
gravels one man may be harmless to another
and, perhaps, worse player. Often each
course has a hole with terrors for certain
players, and yet these holes are rarely alike
in characteristic. Bobby Jones, even, is
among the haunted. His explanation is
that in spite of his faculty of concentration
he cannot help thinking about getting past
the hoodoo ahead, and it worries him until
he has done so.
Car and Cycle
“Huketere”: Preparations. are being
pushed on for Norman Smith’s attempt on
the world’s speed record at Kaitaia Beach,
which the M.L. authorities mean to cele-
brate as a national festival. A 20-miic
stretch of the beach has been surveyed for
the run, and extra accommodation for the
expected crowds is being arranged for. The
beach is 250 miles north of Auckland, and
easily accessible by good roads. The special
electrical timing device lent by the British
Automobile Club has arrived in M.L.
* * * *
“Whizz”: According to Malcolm Campbell
the chief problem, facing speed-drivers of the
future will be visibility. This increases rapidly
in ratio to the speed attained until the pilot
is apt to temporarily lose his vision. Pro-
bably the solution will lie in an automatic
steering device like that fitted on many
modern steamships. By the time that has
proved a success speed will have reached such
a figure that some method of preventing the
man at the wheel from catching fire by air
friction will have to be thought out.
* * * *
“Chevroford”: The latest circumnaviga-
tors are Hector Macquarrio and R. B.
Matthews, who set out the other day from
London to complete a girdle round the earth
in any number of days in a baby car. Their
route will lie through France, Italy, Jugo-
slavia, Bulgaria, Turkey, Iraq, Singapore,
Sumatra, Java and Australia. The first
half of the journey was via America. The
two adventurers are Maorilanders, and if
anybody can succeed they should. A few
years ago they set out from Sydney in the
same baby, and were the first motorists to
drive up to the front door of the telegraph
station at Cape York. Macquarrie wrote a
most engaging book about it —“We and the
Baby,” published by Angus and Robertson.
=|c * * 3e
“Tappet” : Australia has again been invited
by the English Autocycle Union to send
two men across for the, Isle of Man
Tourist Trophy races, to be held in
June. They are practically certain to
be the Victorian nominee, Stuart Williams,
and Dave Brewster, a N.S.W. candidate.
Williams figured in the race in 1930 and did
well until engine trouble knocked him out,
as it did in the recent Phillip Island (Vic.)
road race. Brewster has also a good record,
among liis important wins being the Aus-
tralian Grand Prix at Goulburn (N.S.W.).
A possibility is Westralian Len Stewart,
who tried his hand in the Manx event of
192 S without success. The course is one of
the trickiest in the world, and visiting riders
are handicapped in competing against local
men who have ridden over it a hundred times.
* * * *
“Kick Starter” : Motor-cyclists in all the
States are looking forward to the Aus-
tralian Grand Prix, which is to be run on
a road circuit in the Bathurst district on
Easter Saturday, April 4. entries closing
with the N.S.W. Autocycle Union on March
14. There will be senior and junior Grand
Prix races, each over 100 miles, the junior
limited to cycles under 350-c.c. capacity, and
there will also be a handicap event each for
solos and side-cars. By arrangement with
the local authorities the road circuit on
which the events take place will be closed to
traffic throughout the meeting.
* * * *
“Sprocket” : A Sydney journal is trying
to inveigle the elusive penny ha’penny by
drawing up a grading list, after the fashion
of the tennisers, of the ten best N.S.W.
cyclists on road or track respectively. It
is an interesting commentary on the lack of
interest taken in cycling by the general
public nowadays that hardly one of the
names given is familiar to eye or ear. Time
was when the names of prominent cyclists in
the various States were household words
throughout Australia. Thousands flocked to
see them race and the flappers of those
clays threw tlieir hearts for the heroes to
trample upon. Now things are “contrari-
wise,” as Tweedledee would put it.
Miscellaneous
“Spike”: The difference a wind makes to
a runner is seen in the slow times registered
at Wellington (M.L.) by Carlton and Simp-
son. Carlton won the 100 in 10 2-ssec., two
yards ahead of the American, whose time was
thus 10 3-ssec. A couple of days before
Simpson won at Wanganui in 9 4-ssec., while
lie has a record for the 220 of 20 3-ssec. Yet
over this distance lie was beaten again by
the Australian, who could only manage
22 l-ssec. Carlton also has done much better
than this, for he shares the. Australasian
record with Queenslander N. J. Grelian, the
figures being 21 3-ssec.
* * * *
“The Gaffer”: An enterprising Sydney
journal announced the other day that Jim
Carlton was thinking of turning professional.
The suggestion was promptly denied, though
that was hardly necessary in face of its
absurdity. Trying; to earn money at pro-
fessional running is like knocking off work
to carry bricks. There is barely bread and
cheese in the game to-day for the best of
them, and even in the boom days never more
than a moderate living. The only way to
get. a decent pile together was by betting,
and that was a risky game, beside which
picking ’em at the ponies is like taking
candy from a kid. If any peel ever made a
fortune out of running I never heard of it.
Certainly some of the gaffers did well, but
that is another story.
* :!: * #
“Bumpkin” : Skipper Bennell, of the tiny
Oimara, will go down as the most persistent
challenger .in history. After failing to get
clear replies to his offer to race any yacht
from Melbourne to Maoriland, he sailed his
cockleshell to Sydney to present his chal-
lenge in person to local yachtsmen. Failing
to get a response, he sailed back to Port Phillip
and repeated his offer to Maoriland yachts-
men. A tentative acceptance from one indi-
vidual started him on the 1500-mile trek to
Wellington. Meeting head winds all the
way and some days of terrific seas, during
which he had a rib broken, he lobbed into
Wellington Harbor, where, at latest advices,
he was still looking for an adversary. Ben-
nell, who is a dentist and uses his craft to
visit coastal patients, is of Falstaffian build,
and is a considerable element in his yawl’s
gross tonnage of 60. He carries two navi-
gators, Captain H. Symmons and Lieut.-
Commander Juler, Brendon Monks as wire-
less operator and brother F. S. Bennell as
mate.
* * * $
“Fitzcray”: A record Sydney-Port Phillip
run for a sailing yacht was put up when
Acrospire IV., which had visited Sydney for
the Sayonara Cup, returned to Melbourne
in 3 days 21 hours from Sydney Heads to
the St. Kilda anchorage. Good as this is
it has been bettered by a Tasmanian yacht,
the Nanoya, in 1906. This craft, bought by
a Sydney owner, came out of Hobart to find
a strong south-easterly gale ready to help,
and cast up in Sydney in a trifle under four
days. The distance between points on a
compass bearing is about 700 miles, which
makes the average daily run 175 miles. The
Sydney-Mclbourne route would be about 100
miles shorter, and the daily rate slower.
* * * *
“Long Dog”: Wrestler Pesek, in Aus-
tralia some time ago, took a number of Aus-
tralian greyhounds with him when he re-
turned to America. The other day it was
cabled that he had won the American
National Coursing Derby with a dog named
Sydney, the American event being open to
dogs of all ages and not confined to puppies,
as in Britain and Australia. The winner
was at first thought to be one of the Austra-
lian emigrants, but turned out to be a local
product named by the wrestler in memory
of the Bridge City. One of the Australian
tykes got as far as the fourth round, how-
ever—Just Andrew, a good performer on
this side of the Pacific.
* * # *
“Hotham” :. The long-standing barge be-
tween the Victorian football and cricket
authorities over the use of Melbourne
playing grounds has been settled by Minister
for Lands Bailey. The rivals couldn’t agree',
so the politician hopped in and gave each
side 25 Saturdays. The remaining two
weeks will form a blank period between the
finish of the football in mid-September and
the start of the cricket on October 1. This
will give groundsmen a chance to tune up
the cricket pitches, the impairment of which
by football was the chief bone of contention.
* * * *
“Gate”: Professional football in England
was enlivened the other day when the string
of players hired by Leigh, one of the Lanca-
shire Rugby League teams, struck work and
refused to play in a cup tie against Brad-
ford unless their wages, which had recently
been lowered, were raised to the old level.
The club authorities stood firm, and,
utilising free labor from the reserve players,
got a side together which actually won the
match. What the players’ union will have
to say about this piece of blacklegging re-
mains to be seen.

A WOMAN'S
LETTER
If any weak sentimentality was hinted
at by the tulle veil and the pink rosebuds
which surrounded her in her coffin, it was
entirely contradicted by the strength of
Melba’s face. “She looked as imperious
as in life,” said one of the group who formed
the guard of honor at St. Vincent’s as the
great singer made her final exit through its
gates. John Lane Mullins was there, repre-
senting the hospital, and there was a savor
of old-world dignity and homaee in the
attitude of this official host speeding, as it
were, the diva from her last earthly inn
to the inn eternal. Beside John Lane
Mullins stood the singer’s son, George Arm-
strong ; a little further back were the mother
rectress and the nursing sisters, while the
probationers and nurses not in the guard of
honor grouped themselves in quiet reverence.
There were flow’ers from relations, from the
nuns, from the Governor and from Pamela,
the grandchild whom Melba deeply loved.
Seeing that soberly-garbed last guard
through which Melba passed from St. Vin-
cent's summoned up recollections of another
and gayer one that had formed in her honor.
One night during the last grand-opera season,
when Melba was singing Marguerite, into the
lounge of the Wentworth after the opera
came one by one, or in twos and threes all
the artists of the company. Suddeniy some-
one near the entrance gave a sign, and in
an instant, down the lounge and up the
stairs, the waiting ones fell into a long,
cheering line. To this applause of her fellow-
stars Melba entered, and, laughing, dis-
claiming, visibly touched, mounted to her
loom. Hands ■were clapped, scarves were
waved, men kissed her hand, Toti and
Scavizzi threw flowers, while the world
rocked on a gale of enthusiasm.
To solemn old St. Andrew’s last Thurs-
day Sydney thronged to speed with prayer
and hymn the passing of Melba. The service
was at one o’clock, and this enabled girl
and boy clerks and business men and women
to be a part of the congregation. The ivhoie
of the staff of the Conservatorium, with
music-lovers and well-known concertgoers,
sat in the pews. The fine white head of Dr.
Arundel Orchard was notable. Mr. Justice
Harvey was there representing the Madrigal
Society, as was City Organist Truman,
through whose art probably came the first
announcement of the diva’s death —at his
recital on Monday from his great instru-
ment flowed out 'Chopin’s Funeral March.
On Thursday this work again echoed through
St. Andrew’s in sombre majesty. Archbishop
Wright and Canon Howard Lea officiated.
Mrs. Kate Dwyer made use of a. word so
strange that it either shocked or tickled the
ears of her listeners the other day at the
annual meeting of the Benevolent Society.
In the midst of an ardent appeal for the
Royal Hospital for Women, one of the
society’s greatest institutions, Mrs. Dwyer
appealed to the “wealthy” among her audi-
ence. Is there such a class left in the
State? one wonders. And if there be, with
Mr. Lang waiting with the bludgeon, wlio'd
dare to subscribe themselves members of it?
Anyway, if we aren’t wealthy, we’re well-
meaning, as witness the roll-up to the meet-
ing, which, as usual, took place at the Royal
Hospital for Women. In the interests of
science and motherhood, the nice old gardens
are being gradually usurped by impressive
wards and wings, but still tall trees grow
greenly to delight the eye of the new citizen.
Iresident Thompson made his report with
gravity not unmixed with pride, for the
deficit is very small in comparison with
the good work the society is doing. His
State Ex. threw the light of his presence
on the proceedings, and knight Daniel Levy
proffered the bouquet of commendation to
Mrs. Kate Dwyer, Mrs. A. M. Loewenthal
and Miss Sarah Johnson, the three ladies
on the committee.
Another returnee to her native Sydney is
Mrs. Edwin Calvert, who arrived by the
Oronsay, bringing with her her baby son
Charles. Mrs. Calvert was Nancy Marsden,
whose voice and training fitted her fo'r the
ranks of opera stars, but Nancy chose mat-
rimony instead. Her husband, whom she
married in London, is a young Harley-street
specialist. Her come-back is due more to
ill health among relations than to the sick
condition of the exchange.
Another belated Christmas story. The
young father had been commissioned to
bring home the larger presents. What with
one thing and another, having to pick up
the nuts here and the fish there (Christmas
Eve being a fast day and the young father
and mother R.C.), the amateur Santa Claus
found to his horror when he reached his
Kirribilli home that the bag with the best
doll, the Meccano-set and the Red Indian out-
fit had been lost. To soften the probable blow’,
there being no time to buy more toys, the
childrefi were told hurriedly that somehow
Santa, who had had to meet father in town,
had managed to mislay their ration, but that
father was going back to town to meet
Santa again. “Well,” said the small girl,
“the best thing we can do is to say a prayer
to St. Anthony.” They disappeared, and
father, before he raced back to town to Sher-
lock Holmes at every shop he had visited,
thought he’d take a. look at the innocents.
In their bedrooms they knelt, small girl
praying with silent fervor. But the smaller
boy was loudly voicing his cry to Heaven.
“St. Joseph or Anthony Hordern,” he cried,
“send hack our toys!” And with a hundred
chances against it, the bag was found.
Picturesque visitors to the Methodist Con-
ference are Dr. Wilisoni Lagi and his soft-
eyed daughter Bua. They arrived by the
Morinda from Papua last w’eek. For the
past five years Bua has been training for a
nurse at the Missionary Hospital, Salamoa.
Her father, under the superintendence of
Dr. Gordon Heaslip, practises at the hos-
pital, which is one of the good works of the
Australian Methodist churches.
Special thanks for the home-coming of
many National Councillors were returned by
Ruby Board at the party spread to wel-
come the National Council’s president, Mrs.
Muscio, who ha* been sipping what might be
called a European conference cocktail. Filled
with fresh ideas from this invigorating
stimulant, she returns to the job in which
Ruby of the direct speech and eye has been
her substitute. To begin with, Mrs. Muscio
went away as our chief representative to
the International Council of Women at
Vienna. Later on she attended a conference
of University w’omen graduates in Hungary,
and the corroboree of the British National
Council in Portsmouth, topping off with the
League of Nations Assembly. Among the
returned councillors were Mrs. F. L. Cohen,
Portia Geach, Mary Jay and Dr. Grace
Boelke, whose travels by now rival Marco
Polo’s. Ruby Board was decked with tiger-
lilies and hydrangea, and Mrs. Muscio with
red, red roses, by an enthusiastic committee.
The reception-room of the Women’s Club
was mellow with subdued sunlight, and when
the speeches were finished the women rose
as one in silent tribute to Melba.
“Old girls” of Richmond in Victoria —Syd-
ney has several of them —remember Nellie
Mitchell as a “lucky kid” who wasn’t under
half as many restraints as most girls of the
period; and naice mothers in consequence
warned their treasures not to have much to
do with the hoyden. Still even the staidest
girls could forgive her almost anything for
the queer noises she was able to make in her
throat. Even as early as that, Melba was
practising the trills which were to make her
famous. It was' at Richmond Town Hall,
by the way, that Nellie Mitchell made her
first public appearance; and that was years
and years before her name was in the
papers. She was six when she sang there
at a concert: two songs, “Cornin’ thro’ the
Rye” and one long since forgotten. Nellie’s
mother was her teacher up to that time and
for a long while afterwards.
This gallant-looking girl is Phyllis Arnott,
the first woman in Australia, to pluck a
“B”-cla.ss or commercial flying license. The
youug, blue-
e y e d a i r-
woman’s final
test was a
solo flight
from Mascot
to Go alburn
and back
again. Having
done this and
made the per-
fect landing,
Phyllis was
welcomed amid
the elect. She
flew to Mel-
bourne for the
last Aerial
Derby, and
was one of the
six women
members of
the Aero Club
who flew out
to escort Amy
Johnson in triumph to Mascot. The intrepid
girl has been flying since 1929 only, and
laughs at the suggestion that the game needs
courage. He? father is Dr. 11. R. Arnott,
of Waliroonga. and a cousin is Jean Arnott.

The Murray clan are forgathering in
Sydney. The tall Governor has come down
from Papua on his annual visit, and, after
spending a few days at Government House
with the Games, who are relatives of his
wife, dropped in on daughter Mrs. Pinhey,
at Beecroft, before trekking to Canberra.
Daughter-in-law Marjorie Murray arrived
last Friday, and is busy gathering up her
belongings—including mother and father
Holland —-with the intention of taking them
all to dwell with her and her brilliant lius-
band, Pat, at Cambridge Uni. Lady Murray
is on her way out from London and should
join the family early in March.
With her to St. Vincent’s Melba took her
own bed linen and hand towels. These
were of finest Irish linen embroidered with
her initials. Great singers apparently
travel with such appointments. This Letter
saw in Frances Alda’s room at the Aus-
tralia, when the diva was unpacking, beauti-
fully fine blue silk bedcovers. Probably
there were pillow-slips to tone, for Alda
never spoiled the ship for a ha’porth of tar.
Grace' Yeo, younger daughter of Mrs. J.
W. Yeo, of Aldersyde, Elong-Elong, became
Mrs. Kenneth King, of Dubbo, last Saturday
at St. Mark’s, Darling Point. Romano’s
spread the feast.
Reginald Morpliew’s mother tells The
Bulletin her son —Essie Ackland’s husband
—is not in a London bank. He is a profes-
sional singer.
Joseph Charles Westhoven, whd succeeds
Atlee Hunt as Commonwealth Public Service
Arbitrator, was born 54 years ago at Stan-
thorpe (Q.), where his father was manager
of the then
well- known
tinmine. The
gold discov-
eries of the
early ’nineties
drew him to
W e s t r alia,
where he en-
tered the rail-
way service in
1896. After
attaining a re-
sponsible post
in the accounts
branch he was
selected for
the Common-
wealth posi-
tion of Inspec-
tor of Postal
Accounts in
M e 1 b ourne ;
later he be-
came assist-
ant to the chief accountant. FoT some
years past he has been Deputy P.M.G. for
Victoria, and has recently been engaged on
an inquiry into Commonwealth and State
service overlappings.
Wal Taylor has just finished his work of
binding the honor roll which Mrs. F. B. S. Falk-
iner is giving to the town of Albury in memory
of her. husband. He was Federal member
for the Hume in the fifth Parliament, and
the book, rich with illuminated pages and
exquisite lettering, will be placed in the
Albury Town Hall, shrined in a glass-
fronted cabinet of Australian woods. Every
day a page will be turned (as is the way,
it is said, with the honor rolls of Oxford
and Cambridge). The binding is a thing of
beauty. It is in Madonna-blue leather, let-
tered, tooled and inlaid in old English eccle-
siastical style. _On the front cover are tooled
in gold the Latin and the Greek cross, with
inlays, of royal-blue leather and sapphires.
A design of lily and leaf outlines the cross,
and the edges of the pages show in gold the
old church and grape-leaf design. These
pages are of goat-skin parchment, and here
are blazoned in church script the long list
of soldier names. On the front page Albury’s
coat of arms and a quotation from Kip-
ling’s ‘‘Recessional” stand out in rich relief.
The lettering is by Peter Templeton.
Colonel McWhinnie and his wife, an Aus-
tralian by her first marriage (she was Mrs.
Alf Marks), sailed off by the Orontes the
other day after a short visit to Australia.
With them they took little Pyers Mostyn,
son of Mrs. McWhinnie’s daughter, Lady
Pyers Mostyn. Lady Pyers Mostyn is better
remembered in Australia as Mrs. Bertie
Watson, Bertie Watson of Queensland squat-
tage fame having been her first husband.
After the McWhinnies have left grandson
with the Mostyns, who will arrive in Eng-
land shortly from Asia, the Colonel and his
lady intend returning to Sydney.
A novel attempt to swim the harbor will
be made next Sunday, March 8. The con-
testants are, of course, two of the hardy
sex —Lily Copplestone and Irene Rolfe. Both
girls took part in the recent endurance test
in the Manly baths, and both stayed in the
water over 30 hours, so the little run to
Manly will hold no terrors for them. Miss
Copplestone recently swam Wellington
(M.L.) Harbor. The trial will take place in
a shark-proof net, 30 feet long, 20 feet deep
and five feet wide, towed by two launches.
St. Michael’s at Vaucluse blessed the vows
of Grace Haselden a nd George McCure. Both
are well known in Rose Bay, where the
groom is captain of the water-polo team and
secretary of the swimming club. Uncle
Percy Butler squired the bride, who wore
parchment satin, long and trained. Two
maids in sovereign-gold satin aired another
reminder of olden days in their long lace
mittens. The reception brought about 150
guests in shining raiment to the Wentworth
where the bride’s grandmother, Mrs. Butler’
in black lace gemmy with diamente, did the
honors. ’
Brisbane sends a note:—
At Archerfield aerodrome Sir John Goodwin broke
a bottle of christening champagne on the tiny mono-
plane made in Queensland by G. N. Wilkner, who
founded the Aircraft of Australia Co. and has sup-
plied the equipment for 30 glider clubs. The day
before Kingsford Smith had taken the machine up
and paid a tribute to its. qualities. Foxcroft Jones
gave a show of flying, and there was some speech-
making.
Rose Winter has been named secretary to
the Y.W.C.A. in place of Elsie Reed. She held a
similar appointment in Melbourne before her trip
to the U.S.A. She returned by way of Europe, staying
at the camp of the International Fellowship of
Reconciliation at Oberammergau to see the Passion
Play.
Walter Charles Ogilvie, son of the William. C.
Ogilvies, of Gatton, married Thelma Ellen Louisa,
daughter of the C. 11. Ogilvies, of South Brisbane,
in St. Andrew’s. The church choir, of which the
’groom is a member, preceded the bridal party up
the aisle singing “The Voice That Breathed,’’ and
formed a guard of honor after the ceremony. The
bride, who was given away by her father, was in
satin with a silver lace cap and Brussels silk net
veil. The ’maids were Norma Ogilvie, in silver lace
over green, and Freda Ogilvie, in silver over apricot.
Little Alwyn Dinnar was trainbearer, in pink with a
silver ribbon cap. The Cafe Majestic saw the
feasting, and the honeymoon will be spent on the
Northern Coast. A carved oak chiming clock was
the choir’s present to the ’groom —he is rector’s
warden at St. Andrew’s.
Colin, only son of the W. L. Rudders, of Stan-
thorpe, married Margery Boys, of Toowoomba, in
St. John’s Cathedral, Brisbane. The bride, who was
given away by her uncle, A. B. Nagel, of
Charleville, was in cream georgette' and cobweb
lace, with rose-point lace veil. Dulcia Boys
and Mervyn Dines ’maided in jade green and
jade hats having a pink camellia under the brim.
Roses dressed the Bellevue for the reception, the
bride’s mother wearing black 'georgette and lace coat.
At the Holy Spirit Church, William H. Marshall,
of East Brisbane, and Phoebe Margaret Robinson, of
New Farm, were made one. The bride was given
away by her father; she was in flesh-tint
satin with mastic lace hat. Nancy Robinson ’maided
in frilled lemon georgette with hat ere suite. The
bride’s home saw the feasting before the couple
left for the Blue Mountains for the ’moon.
Atcherley roof-garden was taken by the committee
of the Crfche and Kindergarten Bridge Club io
stage a benefit for its association. The Blair lady,
president of the committee, who received in navy
mariette with touches of shell pink and a pink
baku hat, explained the objects of the club. Mrs.
A. E. Moore, president of the Creche and Kinder-
garten, who also spoke, was in black pussy-willow
with a small green motif. Prizes were won by
Muriel Henderson and Mrs. Coomber.
Jean Crofton, daughter of the A. A. Notts, Yan-
dina, announces her engagement to Kelvin P. Mc-
Grath, of the Australian Forestry School, Canberra.
And Marjorie Alder, of Toowong, is going to marry
George Seaman in April.
And the Speck has a word: —
There is always a special charm about shipboard
dances, and the most exacting guest could find nothing
to criticise at the dance given by the captain and
officers of the Albatross. Captain and Mrs. Feakes
entertained a small official party, including Lord
Somers, Rear-Admiral and Mrs. Evans. About 100
guests danced on the enclosed deck, where the
Continental orchestra made the music. Supper-
tables were gay with red and gold dahlias.
St. Peter’s Church at Geebeston, where the big
timber comes from, saw the wedding of Alice Maud,
eldest daughter of the W. J. Calverts, and Arnold
Rex Geeves. The bride’s frock, of ivory lace and
georgette, was slim and tight as to bodice, full and
flaring in skirt, and was topped by a long veil
held to the head by a coronet of orange blossom.
Daphne, Dora and Joan Calvert followed as ’maids,
in frocks of white georgette and lace with full skirts
and short shoulder capes; little Alice Burgess, who
carried the bride’s cushion, was dressed in frilly
pink and white tulle. Mr. and Mrs. Calvert enter-
tained about 90 guests at their home afterwards.
Twenty-nine of the younger set of girls, with
Catherine Cullinane as hon. ■ sec., held a very suc-
cessful dance at the Imperial. The Navy, with
Rear-Admiral and Mrs. Evans, turned up in force,
and the big ballroom looked its best under the soft
lights with the rich decorations of late summer
flowers.
Miss Good, principal of Zercho’s Business College,
has taken Lindfield, one of the lovely old Holl-
brook-place homes, as a hostel for students training
in the South. Mr. Tom Murdoch formally opened
the premises, and visitors wandered about the
beautiful grounds and through the well-appointed
rooms.
Launceston’s Henley-on-Tamar was the most suc-
cessful yet held. The races were keenly contested,
the Tamar Club winning the State club premiership.
The decorated boats were original and charming,
and there was a fine display of fireworks to wind
up the day. Mayor Boatwright presented the prizes
to the winning crews.
Mrs. R. D. Crane issued about 150 invitations
to an at-home for her daughter Peggy, who starts
for the Big Smoke and matrimony with the Rev.
Cecil Muschamp in the near future. Hadley’s Hotel
seethed with femininity on the occasion. The hostess
received at the entrance to the lounge, wearing a
brown and beige floral silk, with wide-brimmed hat
in the same tones. Daughter Peggy was in lavender-
blue georgette, the slim tight bodice ruckled, the
skirt in three tiers. Tea-tables were gay with dahlias
and other late summer blooms.

Something more than idle curiosity caused
thousands to line the streets for the arrival
of Melba’s coffin from Sydney on Wednes-
day and the funeral on the following day.
There was no pushing or scrambling for good
positions as the cortbge passed by on its way
to Scots’ Church, which was built by Melba’s
father, the late David Mitchell, and in which
she worshipped as a child. Returned
soldiers formed a guard at the kirk door.
For two hours prior to the funeral ser-
vice the public were allowed to file through
the church. Laurel was rvound about the
stone pillars of the chancel, and the casket
was raised high upon a three-tiered cata-
falque. The flowers, which surrounded the
bier, sloped up to the Australian flag that
covered the coffin.
On the day of the funeral folk gathered
in the streets as early as eight o’clock, with
a wait of six hours before them. Portion of
the street outside the church w T as barricaded,
and perfect order was maintained before and
after the service, to which only ticket-holders
were admitted. Dr. Borland preached from
the text, “The Lord gave and the Lord
hath taken away.” As the congregation list-
ened the perfume of orchids and lilies,
mingled with that of other blooms of every
hue, floated upon the heated air, strangely
still, fo'r there were no sounds without.
Students of the Melba Con. aided the choir
in Mendelssohn’s “O for the Wings of a
Dove,” with Lillian Stott as soloist, which
followed the panegyric. “Jesus, Lover of
My Soul,” “There is a Land of Pure De-
light” and “Rock of Ages” were sung, and
the “Pro Defunctis” of Saint-Saens pealed
forth from the organ. When the floral tri-
butes, wreaths of laurel and gilded palms
were collected they filled four lorries and
six motor-cars. Through streets lined with
thousands of reverent people the mortal
remains of the diva were borne for over 20
miles to their last resting-place in the family
vault at Lilydale.
On arrival at the Lilydale soldiers’ mem-
orial the coffin was transferred to a gun
carriage, and the First Camberwell Scouts,
“Melba’s Own,” and a company of Girl
Guides marched beside. Sullivan’s “The
Long Day Closes” was sung by the Lieder-
tafel, and the Angelus was tolled. The “Last
Post” was sounded by two trumpeters of
the Eighth Brigade. Melba’s tomb is upon
a height about three miles from her former
home, Coombe Cottage.
The cottage, bowered in roses, is a museum
of rare and beautiful bric-a-brac and 'pic-
tures. A flagged path through the garden
runs between tall cypress trees and leads to
a Roman bath and a pergola, where climb
wistaria and roses in season.
Very few persons in high official positions
were able to attend the funeral. The Gov-
ernor-General was in Canberra and Lord
Somers in the Apple Isle, and they, the
Lieutenant-Governor, Mayor Luxton, Pri-
minister Scullin and Premier Hogan were
represented by proxy. In the congregation
were the Irvine lady, George Fairbairn and
his wife and Uni. Chancellor MacFarland,
and the musical folk of Melbourne were
present in full force. Among the flowers
were emblems sent by vice-royalty, the
directors of Covent Gardens, Dame Clara
Butt and Kennerley Rumford, Madame Schu-
mann-Heink, Florence Austral and the
London Gramophone Co. At the graveside
several personal friends of the diva, including
Fritz Hart, Bernard Heinze, George Cliirn-
side and George Allan, were pall-bearers.
While the funeral was wending its way to
Lilydale Archbishop Head, who had attended
at Scots’ Church, conducted a service at
St. Paul’s Cathedral, where there was a
large body of mourners.
Weather conditions favored the racegoers
who flocked to Flemington on Saturday,
but apart from that it wasn’t a very pleasant
day for punters. Save in the case of Phar
Lap’s race, on which there was practically
no betting, and Veilmond’s win, the favorites
went down. The course looked a picture with,
its green lawns and trim beds of flowers, in
which pink and mauve hues predominated.
Across the straight, against the rails, beds of
petunias and ageratum made gay splashes,
and the boxes around the grandstand were
filled with the same pastel-tinted blooms.
Roses in lovely varieties cast their fragrance
on the air. The sun shone on a fashion
parade brightened by many dresses of.
various shades of red. There was a sprink-
ling of next season’s modes. A black corded-
silk suit, with a basqued coat bordered, col-
lared, and armleted with white fur, was a
striking but not very impressive example of
the new winter fashions. Mrs. J. I. Winter-
Irving sported a blue-, white- and yellow-
flecked tweed gown with a short cape and
a satin blouse of parchment tint. Mrs.
Douglas Stephens also chose tweed for her
gown and hat, in which brown and green
were mingled. Ensembles were in favor.
Lady Lawford, wlm was accompanied by her
sister, Mrs. Pomeroy Greene, of Bacchus
Marsh, wore a black-and-white patterned
silk frock with a black coat trimmed with
cocoa-colored fur and a black hat. The
Countess of Bective came with the Rus-
sell Clarkes; she was in a navy and
white printed foulard frock topped by a
natural leghorn hat scattered with red and
blue flowers. Mrs. R. Clarke’s tailored coat
and skirt of white serge had touches of
black, and she wore a shady black-and-
white hat. Premier Mitchell, of Westralia,
accompanied his lady, whose floral-figured
blue chiffon gown was topped with matching
millinery. Vic. Premier Hogan was with Mrs.
Hogan, whose grey and white ninon frock was
worn with a black-and-white beret. Jacqueline
Mackinnon looked smart in a trim belted frock
of brown silk. Several dresses of a particu-
larly heavy-textured Chinese silk were to be
seen, and some of these in coat and skirt
mode were very well cut. Mrs. Douglas
Faulkner, one of the Western District re-
presentatives, chose chiffon in amber and
brown tones, with a golden brown felt hat.
There was no vice-regal patronage.
The weather was a patchwork of summer
and winter for the tennis, tournament of the
M.C.C. at the Albert Ground. The early
days of play were unpleasantly warm, and
the finals were played in an Antarctic tem-
perature. The onlookers on the last day
came rolled up in furs and fur-collared coats,
and carried rugs, and the players were glad
to don woollen cardigans or jumpers between
games.
The Richmond Auxiliary of St. Vincent’s
Hospital raked in about £lOO for the insti-
tution by means of a fete and bridge
party at Ruskin Hall, Kew, the home of
Public Works Minister Jones and Mrs.
Jones. Premier Hogan, who was accom-
panied by his wife, launched the affair, and
was thanked by Mrs. T. J. Ryan. Priminis-
ter Scullin’s wife is president of this band
of workers, but she was at Canberra, and
Mrs. D. L. McNamara acted as her deputy.
Mona Nugent, who is shortly to leave us
to continue her musical studies in Europe,
was entertained at a party given by Mr. and
Mrs. Manners-Sutton, of Mariuook, Kew.
Their daughter Mrs. Keith Roberts, Miss
Nugent, Connie Zibel, Bernard McCaffrey
and some others made music, and Isobel
Duncan expressed the company’s good wishes
to the guest of honor.
Mrs. Herbert Brookes is gathering up the
threads of her former activities and is being
warmly welcomed back by her associates in
charitable causes. The president, Mrs. James
Alston, and committee-women of the Women’s
Hospital said cordial things to the accom-
paniment of the clinking of teaspoons when
she reported for service.
Ada Freeman was welcomed home after
her tour abroad by about 40 o’f her pupils,
w r ho staged a tea-party for her at the Lyceum
Club. Winifred Lloyd was chief organiser.
Wearing a brown and orange ensemble,
Alice Richardson, who was for a time secre-
tary of the Austral Salon, was welcomed at
the Wattle by numerous friends, having
returned from a European tour. Mrs. T. G.
Fairbairn, Mrs. J. Ball and Miss S. Ivirham
hostessed the gathering, and Mrs. Richard
Gipps, who was chief worker in the E.S.li.
prior to her visit to Britain, was also given a
greeting.
There were farewells during the week to
artist George Benson and his wife, who
have necessarily to transfer their domicile
to Perth for some time. A commission to
execute some mural decorations in the new
hall of W.A.’s University has come the
painter’s way.
A knot-tying at the C- of E. Grammar
School chapel last week united Kathleen,
daughter of the C. A. M. Crombies, of Mal-
vern, and Kenneth, younger son of the
George Langridges, of Armadale. The bridal
gown was of satin of the warm tint of old
ivory, over which flowed cascades of tulle.
A great sheaf of cream gladioli completed the
picture. The leading lady’s sister Peggy
attended in a roseate glow of organdie and
roses. The bridegroom’s brother-in-law and
sister, Mr. and Mrs. A. J. Phillips, visitors
from Penang, entertained the guests at
supper.
Though Mrs. Edgar Dye is associated with
many philanthropic movements in Mel-
bourne, she
has found
time to add
another inter-
est. She has
become ho n.
organiser of
the production
of “The Best
People” at the
Bijofi Theatre
on March 7,
which is part
of the cam-
paign to col-
lect funds for
the city’s blind
folk. M r s.
Dye is presi-
dent of the
M e 1 b o urne
H o s p i tal’s
almoner de-
partment, an
i n n o v ation
which is doing very good work, and she is
also one of the leading workers on behalf
of the Tweddle Home for Babies.
Melva, daughter of the J. A. Morcoms, of
Horsham, exchanged vows with Alexander,
son of Mrs. J. R. Reynoldson, of Berrigan
(N.S.W.), at Wesley Church. The bride
wore white silk lace with added softness of
chiffon, her sister Norma attending her in
spring-like pale-green frock and millinery.
White and blue was the color-scheme at
the wedding of Sylvia, daughter of Col. and
Mrs Ivnox-Knight, of Malvern, and Spencer,
son of the Thomas Millears, whose estate
is in the Western District; it took place
at the C. of E. Grammar School chapel on
Thursday. The bride carried a sheaf of
delphiniums to match her eyes. Chalk-white
satin gracefully flared formed her gown, and
her tulle veil was anchored by a cluster of
orange buds over each ear. Her sister Elaine
Knox-Knight, Nancy Millear and three
wee maids attended her in high-waisted, long-
skirted frocks of white organdie with sashes
of velvet, topped by poke bonnets. They
also carried delphiniums. There were re-
joicings afterwards at the Lyceum club-
rooms. Many Western District folk were
guests’.
The Montague Cohens celebrated the
fiftieth anniversary of their wedding with
a luncheon party at their Melbourne Man-
sions flat, at which there were 18 guests,
and there was a dinner at The Wattle in
the evening, when a party of 150 congratu-
lated the host and hostess. The orange and
yellow furnishings and floral adornment of
the teashop provided an appropriate golden
setting for the occasion, and 50 candles
twinkled on a tall wedding cake. A cheque
was presented to Mrs. Cohen for the Found-
ling Hospital, Berry-street, East Melbourne,
of which she is president.
At a clothes parade in a Bourke-street
store last week most of the pretty garments
displayed were designed and made in Aus-
tralia. A few imported models were shown
side by side with cheaper local copies ; the
difference in smartness and quality can't
be detected with a microscope. Among
the autumn and winter apparel on
view were smart sports suits, worn with felt
hat or beret, tweed frocks, costumes, en-
sembles, afternoon frocks, top-coats and fur
coats. The fashion-mongers, with their
usual devilish ingenuity, have seen to it
that there is no chance of making .last year's
costumes or coats serve a second season.
There are differences that can't be overcome.
Evening frocks had their place in the show.
Satin shoes peeped from beneath flares and
Mils of satin, tulle and other diaphanous
materials that swept the carpet. Particu-
larly attractive were the wraps appropriate
to such finery. It would seem that the long
coat is likely to take a back seat in favor of
the hip-length sample, which slopes grace-
fully to a longer line at the back. Among tne
smartest surtouts were those in black velvet
or white fur, which are suitable for all
figures.
Tennis enthusiasts were sorry to hear of
the motor accident which befell ex-champion
Norman Brookes, president of the V.L.T.A.,
on Saturday. His brother, Harold Brookes,
who was driving, swerved to avoid an acci-
dent and their car was overturned. Norman
Brookes was taken to the Seymour hospital
suffering from concussion.
To wear the cap and gown of an Associate
of the Royal College of Art, South
Kensington, is an honor highly valued.
Sculptor Ola
Cohn, of Ben-
dig o, lately
returned from
over four
years’ study
in England, is
pictured here
wearing the
regalia. She
has been mod-
elling since
ear ly child-
hood, commenc-
ing her serious
study of the
art at the
Bendigo
School o 1
Mines under
A. T. Wood-
ward, and
later becoming
a pupil of
Mr. Rowbo-
thajn. After a period at Swinburne College
under the guidance of the late Tranthim
Fryer, she went to London, and in her third
year at the R.C.A. won a scholarship which
entitled her to free training for another
year. She has exhibited in London galleries
and in the Paris Salon. Miss Cohn can
claim kinship with the great English water-
colorist Turner, and also with the German
engraver Ballin, much of whose work is
hung in the royal palace at Copenhagen.
The arrival next month of Lord Baden-
Powell, founder of the Boy Scouts, and his
lady is causing as much of a flutter in Girl
Guide circles as in the ranks of the Scouts.
The Girl Guides were inaugurated by the
Chief Scout’s sister, Agnes Baden-Powell, at
his suggestion, it having been noted that
many girls attended the first Boy Scouts’
rally in England in 1909 and seemed anxious
to be in the swim. Lady Powell, whose con-
nection with the Guides dates back to her
marriage with the Chief Scout in 1912, is
now “Chief Guide of the World,” a title
conferred upon her at the conference repre-
sentative of 28 countries held at Foxlease
last year. A dinner party, a Guides’
reception at the Town Hall, a com-
bined rally of Scouts and Guides, and a
church service figure on the programme.
Bridge and music drew 300 people to the
Windsor on Thursday, and many shekels
were added to the building fund of the Novi-
tiate of the Sisters of Mercy at Rosanna.
Margaret Allen and Douglas, son of the
Walter Carnegies, of Kew, who will ex-
change vows at Scots’ Church next week,
were guests of honor at a bridge party given
by Mr. and Mrs. R. E. N. Lawrance at
their flat at Kinnoull, Heyington. Each
guest brought a gift for the bride-elect. The
hostess wore pastel-green chiffon, her sister
Ruth Russell being attired in the same
material of a deeper tint. Miss Allen chose
chiffon traced with a floral design.
Obeying medical orders, E. L. Kiernan,
M.L.C., packed his cabin trunks and, accom-
panied by his wife, is now on the way to
Europe aboard the Euripides. Mr. Kiernan
was in charge of the administration of sus-
tenance for the unemployed, but has been on
the sick list for some months. Members of
the Melbourne and East Melbourne branch
of St. Vincent’s Hospital Auxiliary fare-
welled Mrs. Kiernan, who is a member, over
cups of tea at Menzies’.
Allan Wilkie’s production of “Hay Fever”
at the Tivoli provides a pretty show of the
latest feminine fashions. Miss Watts, as
Judith Bliss, an ex-actress, supports a mas-
querade as a gardener by topping a gold
lame gown with a cheap rush hat. Later
she sports a crimson velvet and chiffon frock
worn with a coat bordered in grey fur, and
later still a dainty floral green georgette
frock which suits her coloring admirably.
Mona Barlee, Ray Fisher and Elma Gibbs
wear graceful evening apparel in Act 11.
Color now enters into home furnishing to
a greater extent than ever before. White
lias been ousted from the kitchen and bath-
room in favor of pink, blue, yellow or green,
and cupboards, icechests, window-curtains
and floor-coverings must be gaily hued, with
the handles of aluminium pots and pans
lacquered in harmony, and the crockery in
matching shades. Colored crystal and glass-
ware is making headway, and lovely sets
are to be procured in jade or tourmaline
pink in murky opaque variety of glass.
The wedding presents showered on Lavender
Stuart when she changed her name to' Grim-
wade included some bright examples of the
new style.
Mr. and Mrs. Harry Austin have forsaken
their estate, Eli Elwan, at Hay (N.S.W.)
for a few weeks while our racing season is
on, and are staying at Mornington.
South Aus. comes to light:—
The Mayoress (Mrs. C. R. J. Glover) convened
a meeting last week in order to finalise arrange-
ments for a large bridge evening in the Town Hall
on March 12. Proceeds will go to the Distress and
Problem Fund for the sons and daughters of dead
soldiers. The Legacy Club is co-operating, and it is
anticipated that there will be 200 tables.
Mrs. E. H. Matthews, with her son and daughter,
has arrived from Sydney to join her husband, State
manager of the National Bank, who has been in
Adelaide for some months.
An interesting exhibition of pictures by Hans
Heysen was opened by Mrs. Lavington Bonython in
the Society of Arts Gallery. The pictures have been
lent by the artist and 27 purchasers of his work from
time to time. Of late years Mr. Heysen has special-
ised in flowers and fruit. The exhibition will run
for three weeks and the Queen’s Home, Rose Park,
will receive half the proceeds of admission. The
late Dame Melba was a great admirer and a liberal
purchaser of Hans Heysen’s work.
Mrs, Fred Drake-Brockman left by the Katoomba
for Perth, after being the guest of her daughters,
the Moulden lady, at North Adelaide, and Mrs.
C. S. Hutchison, at Belair.
The Operatic Society held its annual dance at the
Palais Royal. The Mayor and Mayoress, she in black
and gold lace, were present, and were received by Mr.
Seymour Pank and the secretary (L. Tiptaft).
Mrs. Angas Johnson, who made all the costumes for
the company’s last production, assisted by a few
friends, was gowned in black lace.
Robert R« Page is the second Judge’s associate
to celebrate his appointment by becoming engaged.
The bride-to-be is pretty Lorna Hack, only daughter
of Mr. Bedford T. Hack, of Nannatarra station,
Westralia.
The latest English files give an account of the
marriage of Betty Makin, daughter of Lieut.-Colonel
Ernest Makin, D. 5.0., to Edgar Colquhoun. The
wedding took place at Romsey Abbey. The bride
spent several months last year in Adelaide on a
visit to her grandmother, Mrs. Frank Makin, of
Brougham-place, North Adelaide, and other relatives.
And a P.S. from Westralia:—
A crowd of merrymakers motored to Mount Yokine
for the Golf Club’s monthly hop. Roses decked the
terra-cotta and blue dining-room where supper was
spread. Mrs. C. Campbell wore fuchsia georgettes
on a pearl-grey background; Mrs. Murray wore pink
moire; climbing roses basked upon the trellises of
Maud Mitchell’s ivory georgettes, and primrose
chiffons swayed about her sister Gertrude’s ankles;
crystal drops brightened Mrs. Mackenzie’s turquoise
frock; Mrs. Henry Emmet chose oyster chiffons
patterned with mauve blossoms; Mrs. Hardy wore
black lace; Jo Davies, in red, came with Claire
Not nan, in powder-blue; Mildred le Souef was in
mauvy-grey taffetas; and Mrs. A. Cummings was
willowy in lilac.
His Majesty’s being occupied by the Nellie Bram-
ley Co., Charles Iffla gave his farewell concert in
Government House ballroom, and must have been
gratified at the size of the audience. The stage was a
foot-high platform, and the majority of listeners saw
little more than Iffla’s beard and white tie and a
ripple of Lilian Crisp’s brown locks. Miss Crisp,
wearing long white gloves with her carnation-pink
chiffons and crystal necklace, assisted with her
soprano, and Margaret Sharp, looking youthful in
white, with her fiddle. A. J. Leckie was the accom-
panist. He trained Iffla before the promising young
singer set off for Italy, and Miss Crisp before she
went to the Albert-street Conservatorium.
In the past pilots landing at Albany have used
a natural landing ground on the beach. Last week-
end five ’planes, including the new Junkers of the
Goldfields service, flew from Perth, and amidst
stunting, joyriding and speeches a new landing
ground was opened. Introduced by Mayor Charlie
Wittenoom, his Ex., who with Lady Campion has
spent a couple of months at Government Cottage,
declared the ground ready for business.
Vivacious little Irene Carter, who held an exhi-
bition of water-colors in the Town Hall in December,
is staging a similar show for a fortnight in the
Karrakatta Club. Her brush has caught the misty
dawns and still summer evenings of Venice, the in-
tricate details of churches, and the dark olive-greens
and snowy skylines of the Austrian border. Glimpses
of the Australian bush and flower studies are equally
appealing. Miss Carter has sent to Italy for a
cargo of oils, left behind owing to her hurried
departure. She hopes to give an exhibition in Mel-
bourne in a few weeks.
The Waldie-Forbes couple are off to Europe by
the Orontes.
Eileen King-Lethbridge and Senator E. B. John-
ston exchanged promises on a recent evening in St.
Paul’s kirk, Harvey. A family jewel in the form
of a Maltese cross was the sole adornment for the
bride’s parchment satin gown. Her embroidered
veil was clasped by twin sprigs of orange blossom.
Three ’maids, Flora Lethbridge, Mabel Hester and
Dorothy Richardson, held sheafs of hydrangeas
against their long frilly chiffons, and small Judith
Horrocks, in a fluff of tulle, carried a basket of roses.
Gladys Moncrieff’s two-weeks’ season at the
Ambassadors was so widely advertised that there
was a street-deep crowd at the station to meet her.
Gladys, .clad in Air-Force blue, drove through the
streets in an open car and heard herself singing
at all the music-shops en route.
The Repertory Club opened its doors on 1931
with a general meeting and a social in one week.
At the latter gathering there were two short play-
lets, a back-to-kindergarten frolic, a competition and
some solo numbers. Molly Ick wore an ensemble
of beige lace. Margaret Saunders, Gwen Dowson,
Dorothy Powell, Mrs. Parker and Marjorie Swain
were among the members present.

AS WE SAID BEFORD-
This page will be devoted week by week to reproductions of the
gems in picture, story and verse published in “The Bulletin” of last
century, so that pleasant memories may be revived in old readers and
a new generation may enjoy the things that delighted an earlier one.
On the Logan lived a Hibernian selector,
each of whose cows had about 10 three-year-
old calves every year, and who came nearly
stocking a station with the progeny of half
a dozen old milkers. His beef had cost him
nothing for 20 years. A sudden sickness
brought the fear of death, and with that
there came remorse and a desire to confess
his sins. But the visiting priest was an
Irishman who believed that Mick Ryan (as
we shall call him) was the most honest man
on the Logan, and Mick was not equal to
laying bare all the skeletons (of his neigh-
bor’s cattle) in the dark cupboard of his
soul. There came a rumor that Father
Seortcchini, an Italian priest, had been
appointed to that district, and Mick’s wife
rushed into the sick man’s room with the fol-
lowing proposal: “Good news, Mick! There’s
an Eyetalian praste with a name like
Scorchajinnie cornin’ down here to-morrow.
Shu re the divil a word he knows of either
luglisli or Oirish, and you can confess all
about thim cattle, for the divil a word lie’ll
know what you’re talkin’ about.”
There is a story about old Peter Faucett,
the N.S.W. Supreme Court Judge. He was
somewhat short-sighted, and one day a very
diminutive barrister appeared before him to
move something or other. When the short
man stood up alongside “Jumbo,” a very
tall barrister, who was sitting down, their
heads were about on a level, and as soon
as the small man began, “If your Honor
please, I”—— “Ye must stand up when y’
address the Coort,” interrupted old Peter,

and legislator.

irascibly. “I am standing up,” said the small
man with dignity. “Then tell the gentleman
alongside ye to sit down.”
Here is another story of Jimmy Tyson,
the Australian Croesus. On a station front-
ing the Lachlan, two sundowners were re-
clining under the shade of a gum-tree, while
their thoughts were being wafted across the
paddock to the kitchen, for they intended to
“touch” the cook, in addition to accepting
the regulation allowance of a pannikin of
flour. Seeing a shabby. horseman approach,
they inquired whether the station belonged
to “Hungry” Tyson? That evening when
the storekeeper was about to serve out the
“dust,” this same horseman appeared, and
ordered them into the kitchen. He then bade
the cook give them two square meals each,
and fill their “tucker-bags” in the morning;
and, turning to the “travellers,” said “ ‘Long
Jim’ Tyson lives here, but ‘Hungry’ Tyson
is not known in these parts.”
George Leitch, the actor, tells a melancholy
story of Levuka, Fiji. He was negotiating
for the loan of a horse, and the courteous
innkeeper produced a ramshackle animal
which had strayed by accident into the wide
realm of zoology, and informed him that he
would find the beast friendly and reliable.
So he did. It tacked first for the sea and
then made for a ditch, and every now and
then it fell into a contemplative mood out
of which it scrambled with considerable
difficulty. It didn’t give the eminent actor
the slightest show to view the scenery, and
after it had fallen into a river 'and been
too much astonished to get out without
assistance, George dragged it back to its
owner, who inquired if he hadn’t enjoyed
himself. He had quite forgotten, he added
cheerfully, to mention that the horse was
quite blind of both eyes, but he would pro-
bably find the moke perform better in a
buggy. George said he would try him in
the buggy, and so an aged vehicle was hauled
out—a rust-colored trap with faded, blue
cushions from which the stuffing projected,
and with rat-holes at every corner and a
general appearance of having been welted
with clubs ; and Leitch and his host set out
on a breathless tear round the coast.
“ ’Tain’t every gentleman can boast of hav-
ing a ride in this vehicle,” gasped the land-
lord as he was bumped up in the air. “It ain’t
quite new, you know —whoa, ye brute! It’s
the kerridge the Sydney bigbugs gave to
Thackambaw —liudd up, will ye! There was
measles in it”—here a sudden movement of
the blind horse deposited the landlord in the
bottom of the trap—“killed 24,000 Fijians,
the infection did,” he added as the horse
threw him up on to the seat again. “Whoa!
They had to hide the carriage away”—he
went on—“but some of the people got to it
once, and welted it orfal. After it ’ad been
hid for 10 years, I bought the thing at an
atiction for 30 bob” —but here the steed
shook George up in the atmosphere again
and he took some time in coming down.
THE GODS—A SONNET.
Last night, as one who hears a tragic jest,
I woke from dreams, half-laughing, half in
tears;
Methouglit that I had journeyed in the
spheres,
And stood upon the Planet of the Blest,
And found thereon a folk who prayed with
zest
Exceeding, and through all their painful
years,
Like strong souls, struggled on, ’mid hopes
and fears.
“Where dwell the gods,” they said, “we shall
find rest.”
The gods? What gods, I thought, are these
who so
Inspire their worshippers with faith that
flowers
Immortal, and who make them keep aglow
The flame for ever on their altar-tow’rs?
“Where dwell these gods of yours?” I asked
—and, 10,
They pointed upward to this Earth ot
ours!

IN WAR-TIME.
The talk in the hut that night was about
sheep-dogs. It always is. Long-winded,
pointless, witless, interminable perjuries
respecting sheep-dogs, interrupted only by
the monotonous “fifteen-two,” etc., of a
pair of crib-players.
At last a man who was reading in his
bunk, and who was always wasting his
money on newspapers and things, said:
“This Japanese war is getting pretty hot —
how will it go, Bos’n?”
Bos’n was an old shepherd who had been
a man-o’-warsman in his time.
“Don’t know, I’m sure. Things are dif-
ferent from when I was at sea. Seem to
fight all right, though.”
“Those Chows appear to treat their men
pretty rough.”
“There’s others treated rough in war-time
besides Chows. I’ll tell you. I was bos’n’s-
mate of a ninety-four gun alhip at the
Crimea.' One day we hauled in as close as
we could get under some Russian forts, and
commenced to bang at them. They pelts
back at us, and w T hen they got the range
their stuff began to come on board pretty
thick. After a while of this, word was
passed that solne of our chaps
were running below from the
guns. Rotten bad lot; some
of them were not long out of
gaol and workhouse. The
bos’n and his mates —I was
Okie —gets our cats, goes down,
and lambs them up on deck
again. Some were triced up
and flogged properly. There
was over 30 men flogged on
that ship while she was in
action. How’s that for rough?
I hurt a lot of chaps in that
fight, but I didn’t kill no more.
“Another time I did kill a
good few. In India that was
—time of Mutiny. We went
for a small sort of a town that
had a wall all round it, and
was chockful of niggers. Most
of dur chaps got inside to
hustle them up, and an officer
took about 20 of us round out-
side the wall and placed us
on sentry-go at the gates. I
was put at a narrow sort of
a gateway by. myself.
“ ‘Ain’t I to let no one out?’ I says to the
officer.
“ ‘lf the niggers come out, just' see that
they don’t get away,’ says he.
“Our chaps was firing, and there was an
awful row going on inside. I stood close
to the gateway with my bayonet ready, and
presently a chap bolts out of the hole and
spits himself fair on it. I shoves him on
one side, and two or three more come and
I got them, too. Two of our chaps was at
a gate 50 yards away. One of them was a
mate of mine, and he sings out:
“ ‘My bag agin yours. Sam, for a pound
of tobacco.’
“ ‘Right,’ ” says I.
“I must have stood at that door for over
three hours, until things were quietened
down inside, and never let one by me, and
when we came to count up my tally was
14, and the other two had only 18 between
them. So I won easy.
“I wish I had that tobacco again.”

The Death Boomerang.
J. BERNARD TOOHEY TELLE A TALE OF THE ARUNTA BLACKS
OF CENTRAL AUSTRALIA.
THE boomerang of death did not seem
such a terrible weapon wrapped in
cloth from a discarded flourbag and
lying among the other strange objects in
the pertalehera; but Eruramunga, knowing
its terrible powers, handled it with trembling
fingers, and, slowly unwrapping the cloth,
examined it in the dim light of the cave. It
was red, the sacred color of the Arunta tribe,
a gleaming blood-red; and it was a strange
boonierang, most unlike those made by the
natives in the surrounding country. It was
smaller, lighter and the curve more pro-
nounced. On the flat blade were strange
cuts in the wood, strange characters which
had something to do with the iruntarinia,
the spirits, and with death, but the meaning
ot which no one knew, not even the medicine-
men, who were in almost personal touch with
the iruntarinia and should know everything.
Sitting in the pertalehera and looking at
the sacred totemic objects which were all
bound up with the life of the tribe, past,
present and future, Eruramunga mourned
tor the day. when the Arunta were really
a great nation long before the white men
came to the slopes of the Macdonnell Ranges.
One by one Eruramunga took out the
churingas from a hole in the floor of the
small cave and examined them, pieces of
stone, wood and bone, with strange
designs on them, all coated with a
mixture of red ochre and fat. For
Eruramunga was the inkata, the chief man
of the little group of the Arunta tribe which
eked out an existence in the surrounding
country, whose barrenness had stopped, tem-
porarily, the advance of the white man. It
was the inkata’s duty to look after those
strange, sacred objects. And the pertalehera
was the sacred storehouse of the churingas
forbidden ground to all women and young
boys not fully initiated.
The inkata was an old man. There were
long white, hairs, all over his naked body,
and the. hair of his head and beard was grey
an d thin. About his shrivelled body were
terrible scars, some of them received in
fighting, but most of them the result of self-
mutilation according to tribal custom.
Eruramunga could remember the days
when his father was the inkata and the
group of natives which he led was five times
as large as the one over which he, Erura-
munga, now held sway. Those were the
days of the big corroborees, when the eng-
wura ceremony lasted for months and the
tribesmen gathered from very far. A mes-
sage stick was sent out, and then the urliara,
the fully-initiated men, gathered for the big
eorroboree.. Besides the ceremony itself there
were fighting and hunting, laughter and
sometimes tragedy, and now and then, to add
spice to the programme, even an illicit mar-
riage between a man and a woman who were
taboo to each other.
But those days were over, and now the
corroborees were so little that Eruramunga
knew his father would have been ashamed of
them. But the numbers of the Aruntasi had
fallen off, even as those of the kangaroos,
the wallabies and the emus had done, before
the advance of the white man.
. A young boy was to go through his first
initiation ceremony, the lartra, within six
sleeps. The inkata looked at the stone
knives and thought upon how few they would
be who would take part.
He picked up the terrible boomerang again.
The story of its coming to the tribe was
a wonderful one, and as Eruramunga re-
called it his old fingers felt the smooth
surface of the weapon.
One day a great medicine-man, who was
also a great rain-maker, went to sleep at
the mouth of a cave. Some said that it
was the very cave in which Eruramunga was
sitting.. (The old man looked around, half-
suspecting that a spirit or two were peering
over his shoulder. But he saw only a rat
scampering out into the sunlight.)
During the night the iruntarinia, the
spirits, visited the medicine-man and sliced
ofE his little finger. And then, before the
astonished eyes of the frightened man, the
little crooked finger grew until it was a
boomerang. In terrible voices the irun-
tarinia then told him to take the boomerang
back to his people and keep it with the
other churinga. It must never be thrown,
they commanded, and if this was disobeyed
not only could the man who threw it die .
out it would mean sure death to the person
or persons at whom it was thrown, and
would result in disaster to the tribe. It
was death for a woman to see it.
The great medicine-man hurried back to
his people, produced the boomerang and told
them the story. For proof he showed them
hi.s left hand with the finger missing. If
some of the other medicine-men were in-
clined to doubt the story they did not say
much; for how could they account for the
missing finger? That was proof absolute.
And ever since the sacred boomerang had
formed a prominent part in the corroborees
of that branch of the tribe.
One day, it was said, a member of one
of the southern tribes visiting the Arunta
saw the boomerang and claimed that it was
identical with one which had at one time
belonged to. a man of his tribe, who had
received it in trade for a spear from another
tribe farther south. But they promptly
speared him for fear that the iruntarinia
should, hear him and take vengeance upon
the tribe for the insult.
That was the legend of the sacred boome-
rang. and no wonder the old man’s hands
trembled as he handled it. Slowly he re-
placed the churingas, covered the hole in
the ground with a slab of rock and left the
pertalehera. He clambered down out of the
mass of rocks in which the cave was situ-
ated, thrown in wild confusion by the hand
of nature, and made his way across the dry,
sandy bed of a creek to the camp.
The barking of the dogs warned him that
something was wrong as he topped the ridge.
Looking down gn to the plain he saw three
•horses at the camp. Alongside them was a
white man.
Eruramunga recognised the white man:
he wandered around with his horses looking
for little stones. Eruramunga called him
Erita Wideriga, the bewitched one, because
his behavior was foolish. Time and time
again he had told the old inkata that the
little yellow stones he sought were worth
much tobacco, and that if he could tell of i
many stones they would bring him enough
tobacco to last his tribe for many moons.
Erita Wideriga was known from Char-
lotte Waters to Tennant Creek as Lefty
Harris, and was just as much at home
in the hunting grounds of the Arunta as
the tribesmen were themselves. The exist-
ence _ which he eked out as a dryblower in
the inhospitable parts of Central Australia
was almost as precarious and as hard as
that of the natives. Besides his riding horse
and packhorse Lefty had now a spare mare,
because he had a special object in coming to
this isolated camp. He was going far away
from white settlements and missionary sta-
tions, and intended taking a black girl with
him.
He had been to this camp before and knew
Eruramunga. Catching sight of the old
in kata walking towards him, he hailed the
black man with “Hello, Charley!” With
his six-feet-two of bone and muscle the white J
overtopped the old men and women who
were around him begging for tobacco and I
flour. Only the children and the elders were
in camp. The others were away hunting.
After receiving two bags of flour from
the white man Eruramunga went to his
mia-mia to escape the noonday heat, while
Lefty, followed by the children, went to a
hillock three hundred yards away and set up
a fly-tent. After he had completed his work
he sat down to wait the return of the hunt-
ers, the young women in particular.
The return of the hunters was heralded by
the arrival of a score more dogs. With
shouts of glee the men and women came
dancing into camp with two fine euros, a
small species of kangaroo, and a wallaby.
The women had been collecting grass seeds
and catching rats, mice and grubs. Lefty
looked at them closely. There was a lot of
talking and pointing in his direction.
“They’re a pretty frowsy lot of scare-
crows,” he muttered to himself. Then his
eye caught sight of one girl, and he knew
that he was not going to ride away alone,
after all.
She was tall and well-developed and walked
with a grace denied to white women who
have not had years of practice in carrying
pitchis, wooden troughs, balanced on their
heads. She was naked like the rest of the
tribe, and a string of beads made from red
bean-berries was not an unpleasing addition
to her chocolate-colored beauty. He looked
for the signs of disfigurement which he knew
every native woman had to suffer in accord-
ance with tribal lave, and could see only two
long scars joining the breasts. Lefty guessed
her age at 15. She was as good-looking a
gin as he had ever seen; and he had been
a visitor to many camps.
He looked at the girl again as she walked
towards the camp, passing within 50 yards of
his tent. On her head was be 1 meed a pitchi
of grass-seeds, and she carried herself with
charming grace. In another ten years Lefty
knew that she would be as ugly as her sisters
and showing signs of approaching old age.
Lefty’s eyes still feasted on her body, as
she turned and answered his look with a
smile. Then without another movement of
her head she went to Eruramunga’s mia-mia
and, taking two stones, a small one and a
large one with the centre hollowed out, com-
menced to grind the seeds. And thus Lefty
received his first set-back: the object of his
desire was Eruramunga’s wife, Chantunga.
But Lefty knew better than to be wholly
discouraged. With a bottle of whisky in one
hand and two large plugs of tobacco in the
other, he walked slowly past the inkata’s
mia-mia twice, and then kicked a fox-terrier
to attract the attention of Chantunga. She
looked up at him and smiled. Lefty smiled
back and then handed out the whisky and
tobacco. Chantunga took the proffered gifts
and smiled still more encouragingly.
Satisfied with liis progress, Lefty turned
around and saw Eruramunga Standing at
the entrance to his mia-mia, looking at him
with eyes full of anger. He watched the old
inkata walk up to his wife, take the tobacco
from her, throw it away and smash the
whisky-bottle on a stone. He saw a wild
scramble for the tobacco; then amid the con-
fusion, the shouts and cries of the men and
women and the barking of the dogs, Lefty
walked slowly back to his tent, thinking hard.
In his tent he killed flies and cursed Erura-
munga and the already accursed race of
the Arunta.
Lefty was worried. It was the first time
that a. native had done anything like that
to him—-had openly shown disapproval of
the actions of a white man. Lefty was
damned if it wasn’t an insult; and until he
rolled himself in a blanket and went to
sleep his thoughts were full of plans for
reprisals.
The next morning, however, he decided
that he would forgive the inkata and try
other measures. Walking over to the group
of native bush huts, he smilingly greeted
Eruramunga. He told him that he wanted
Chantunga and was willing to pay for her.
He sought to dazzle the eyes of the old native
with knives, tomahawks, plugs of tobacco
and bottles of whisky—all the whisky he
had left. But Eruramunga shook his head ;
the most he would do was to present the
white man with a mongrel bitch. Out of
hearing Lefty cursed the old man again and
sent the dog howling back to the main camp
As the day passed his desire to have the
girl became stronger, and he searched
around for ways and means of attaining his
ends. He was a white man and would not
stand any insults from a dirty abo., he told

And Chantunga was just as eager as he
was. The idea of living with a white man
appealed to her. So that next morning an
old hag named Ertuntarra told Eruramunga
that during the night she had seen Chan-
tunga creep into the white man’s tent.
According to the old laws, there was only
one thing to do—kill Chantunga and the
white man too; and the old man -fingered
his spear-thrower at the thought of it. But
he remembered that the white men frowned
on the old tribal laws and that the killing
of even a native was followed by the visit
of a mounted trooper, who asked awkward
questions and finally rode away with the
murderer. So the inkata sat and pondered
and watched the sun rising over the hills
and warming the ground. He thought of the
injilla, the pointing death-bones, but he
knew that the white man would not sicken
and die like the black man. The white
man’s magic was always too strong.
Chantunga went again to the white man’s
camp that night. Eruramunga saw her go
and return.
The next morning he spoke to some of the
men and suggested that they should kill
Lefty. But they told the inkata that he
was talking foolish words, because it would
mean death to everyone. Eruramunga
reviled them and called them women and
cowards; in his younger days he had killed
two white men, he told them. But still
they would not move, and advised him to
accept the whisky and tobacco. To their
minds it was a wonderful bargain.
For more moons than any man could
count Eruramunga had looked upon the
white men with hatred because they had
driven the Arunta further and further back
into the waterless wastes, taking the good
grounds where the game was plentiful for
their cattle stations. Black men, he told
himself in bitterness, were forbidden to
touch the white man’s cattle, but the white
man slaughtered the black man’s kangaroos
whenever he could. So the inkata sat and
brooded. He did not know what Fate had
written ; he only knew that it was becoming
ever more difficult to get food, and that soon
they would have to move farther out into
the western desert country, or go into the
mission stations in the white man’s settle-
ments.
Because of this new affront, the violation
of the tribal laws, all the hatred that the
old man had for the white invaders centred
in Lefty Harris. Fingering his spear he
thought again of the white man and the
beckoning hollow in his shoulder-blade. But
the white man’ had a gun and might kill him
before he could get near enough to throw
the spear. And though Eruramunga would
gladly die if he knew that the white man
would die too, there was no sense in tin-ow-
ing his life away without a return.
Ertuntarra came up and sat alongside him,
and in sign language told him that Lefty
was getting ready to leave and that Chan-
tunga had boasted that she was going with
him. To live with a white man and wear
dresses and plenty of glass beads, and never
know what it was to want for tobacco—
no wonder Chantunga was exultant at her
luck and strutted before her sisters in a
pair of stockings and feather hat that was
the mode in 1912 ! In a mixture of pidgin
English and Arunta dialect, Lefty had told
her that he would get her a dress when he
passed near enough to a store. Meantime
Chantunga wore the stockings and the hat.
She was going away with a white man!
She had finished with old Eruramunga, who
made her go out and catch kangaroo-rats in
the long grass, and witchetty grubs and grass-
seeds, and work all the time. Asa white
man’s wife she would never work. And
Lofty looked on and laughed with all the
white man’s superiority. Eruramunga, after
his first, outburst, was taking things calmly,
and accepting his fate at the hands of a
white man with the proper air of submission,
At lqast that was what Lefty thought,
Eruramunga listened to Ertuntarra’s few
grunted words, and rose to his feet slowly,
At the back of the ridge behind him, over
the creek, was the pertalchera; and in the
pertalchera was death, certain death for the
white man and himself. But disaster had
already overtaken him, and he was not afraid
to die.
Carrying a pitclii under his arm the inkata
returned to the camp and squatted down out-
side his mia-mia.
The white man’s horses were saddled,
re ady. Chantunga was with him, still wear-
ing ber hat with its draggled feather. The
silk stockings had been almost torn to
shreds by tho rns. She was laughing, happy
j n the knowledge that she was going far
away. Once or twice she pointed over at the
squatting inkata and laughed louder. The
remainder of the tribe were apparently going
about their usual occupations without any
concern. But all the time they were watch-
ing Eruramunga, who with his wrinkled old
f ace expressionless sat and watched,
Sure of himself and his terrible powers,
Eruramunga’s feelings for his young wife and
f- be wb it e man were those of contempt. They
were jj ko stupid emus in their inability to
comprehend their terrible danger.

Eefty Harris finished tightening the rope
011 tke packhorse and then, turning around,
k * s hand and called out, Good-bye,
Gnarley.
With his eyes blazing, Eruramunga sud-
denly picked the blood-red boomerang of
death out of the pitchi and leapt to his feet,
brandishing it. Then with a terrible yell he
threw it in the direction of the white man
an d Chantunga. He saw it fly on its course,
and then collapsed on the ground,
There were shouts and cries from the
other natives as they fled m terror into the
m ulga scrub. Chantunga was too frightened
to move or sing out during the few moments
that the boomerang was flying through the
am. It all happened so suddenly that even
the big slow-witted white man did not have
time to do anything but hold his breath,
. I be flying weapon behaved strangely in
the air, and, changing direction struck the
ground, ricocheting away to fall twenty
yards from Lefty Harris,
Taking his rifle Lefty ran over to the
prostrate form of Eruramunga, but the old
inkata was dead. Puzzled, the white man
returned to where the boomerang had fallen.
Afraid to stir, Chantunga remained by the
side of the horses, with her face buried in
her hands, so that she could not see the
terrible churinga.
Its polished surface glinting in the sun,
the boomerang was lying on top of a clump
of porcupine grass. Lefty picked it up and
examined it. Turning it over he saw the
mystic symbols that referred to death, put
there by the iruntarinia, the spirits, and so
sacred that even the medicine-men themselves
did not know their real meaning.
Lefty laughed as he read the inscription
on the blade:
Genuine Australian Boomerang. Drink ■ —
Whisky and Return for Another Spot. With the
Compliments of the Company.
The loud raucous laughter of the white
man, the mournful howl of a dog crouching
beside the dead body of its master, mingled
in a chorus with the chirpings of the death-
bird, the chichurkna, invisible to mortal eyes
as it carried away the soul of old Erura-
munga, to await reincarnation in the pertal-
chera.
Forth and Far.
Oh I intend to walk out clear,
With a long stride and even,
Over the level rolling plain
To the rising lands of Heaven,
The sun will beat upon my head,
The earth spring lift my heel;
There will be sticky dew of flowers
And hawks there, awheel;
With magpies clattering, “Hark the hawk!”
And pelting them in the sky,
The shining beaks, the fighting sun,
The striding I!
Oh the land wind whipping upon my face,
The earth gods singing low,
The fairy people upon the hills—
Dear Lord, the things I know!
Parrots crimson and shadow trees,
The hills with their holy fire,
Blue of grey and grey of green—
Long limbs never tire
Striding the foam of seedy grass,
And the last dissolving blue ;
The granite’s grey as leaping thighs
Of velvet kangaroo!
Feathers press me down from the air,
Facing the wheeling west,
Body panting and mindless thought,
Milk of the good earth’s breast—
The spirits have me! Oh they are mine!
I am the sap of a tree!
The wind in the way; the whirring grass!
Now at last I am free!
Chuckle, chuckle of those tall gods....
They see me at last go down
To the binding-in of a mortal arm,
To the little, lowly town.
QUEENSLAND.
LIYWELYN LUCAS.
While I Sit Here.
While I sit here in this grey, ugly room,
With imitation marble on the floor
That is a square of cheap linoleum,
With green glass, frosted, in the window-
frames,
And almanacs on mustard-colored walls,
And hear the newsboys yelling in the street
Of murder trials and threatenings of a
strike
By stucco fronts and garish picture shows
That offer man an intellectual feast
To fit the age—l know that, far away,
There are wide arches of pale turquoise sky
Whereon the buzzard floats, bald-headed,
black.
And in the orange sands the camels go,
Silently padding to the mountain pass,
Where tower to the heavens glistening peaks,
And when the torch of sunset fires these hills
Down to the sand go the bright praying-
mats.
And when the night has fallen lions come
Sniffing where there are footprints in the
sand,
And in the gorge the lean hyena laughs;
There is a scented wind to cool the earth
From some rose garden whose flat roofs are
filled ,
With chattering women drinking in the air;
Their anklets jingle and their jewels flash,
And they have golden slippers on their
feet....
And I sit here in this grey, ugly room!
QUEENSLAND.
M. FORREST.
Sickroom Sonnets.
A wren hops in the jacaranda-tree
And boldly flaunts his flashing, royal blue.
His little court, all sober brown of hue,
Attend their sultan deferentially.
I hear my spaniel yelping to be free.
He knows just whence the rustling quail
outflow
But yesterday, and knows, good hound and
true,
The hunter’s pleasure must be shared with me.
The lingering wattle scents the springtime air;
It blends for me with phenyl’s morbid reek.
I throw my window widely as I dare,
Quite lawlessly, to cool my fevered cheek
With unsophisticated wind ; for here I’m “set,"
A kind of leper in his lazarette.
That they who suffer most complain the least
I’ve often heard, and probably it’s so;
And were not spring’s effulgence spread
below
So prodigally free, the selfish beast
That lurks within one like a ferment yeast
Might cease to be the trumpeter of woe
And take from Gratitude the knock-out
blow,
Disclaimed, disowned, unshriven of god or
priest.
For many another helpless, luckless wight
Great Nature's pageant passes all unseen.
For him are but the phantoms of the night
And sordid outlook in surroundings mean:
While here the wonder of the year’s unrolled
When Spring puts on her robe of green and
gold.
