James Brunton Stephens.
L
JAMES BRUNTON STEPHENS was born
at Bo’ness, on the Firth of Forth, in Linlithgow-
I shire, on the 17th June, 1335. He was the
youngest son in a family of six—two brothers
'and three sisters. His father was the master of the
parish school. His mother’s family traced itself back to
George Buchanan (tutor to Janies VI of Scotland), a
writer with a European reputation, whom Camden has
spoken of as “easily the first poet of his age ; whom
Dryden acknowledges as “comparable to any of the
moderns and excelled by few of the ancients, and whom
Hr. Johnson has referred to as “ a great poetical genius,”
and “ the only man of genius whom his country ever
produced.” In the Bo’ness parish school was housed the
town library, to which young Stephens had free access.
Fielding, Smollett, Shakespeare, and the English classics
were more to the boy’s taste than athletics, for which he
never showed any inclination.
At 11 his father died, and a friend secured him
a presentation to a Foundation School in Edinburgh, not
far away. A delicate, shy, nervous lad, the tyranny, im-
morality and brutality of his surroundings were torture
to him. He loathed the place, in which he remained for
four years. He left it to join the University classes,
taking pupils to pay his fees. When the classes were in
vacation, he wandered off to earn enough to pay his way
(in the familiar Scotch*student fashion), and, when work
was resumed, he took his classes in Greek, moral
philosophy and mathematics at the University, with
Latin, logic and mental philosophy at the New College,
Edinburgh. In each of these branches of study he secured
an honourable place, but was nevertheless forced to
abandon his course ere proceeding to a degree, or, rather,
having got the groundwork of the culture he desired,
he was tempted away from the mere diploma by an
invitation to become a travelling tutor to the family of a
Massey-Pawson. The position was secured for him
through the influence of a fellow student named Simp-
son, whose father later on became the discoverer of
chloroform as an anaesthetic —and a knight. With the
Massey-Dawsons young Stephens visited Paris, where
they stayed many months, and where he learned French.
The Mas'sey-Dawgons had entertained Napoleon 111 in his
poorer days in London, and in turn were entertained by
that potentate during their visit to Paris. They wintered
in Pisa, returned to Paris, and thence to London, where
Stephens left them and again became a travelling tutor
to the family of Captain Leyland of the Guards.
&
The Leylands were very wealthy. They
“ literally rolled in riches.” Their private yacht carried
a doctor, an honorary captain, as well as a practical sail-
ing master, and a crew of thirty. They visited Gibraltar,
Marseilles, Genoa, Palermo, Athens, Constantinople,
Sebastopol, Jaffa, Damascus and Cairo, making many
excursions inland. They called in at the Crimea while
the troops were vacating the place (March, 1856). From
Jaffa they travelled through Palestine-; and from
Cairo they sailed up the Nile, spending in all eighteen
months in the Mediterranean. During this period
Stephens’s first attempts at poetry are recorded. In an
old pocket-book are preserved two sets of verses remini-
scent of the voyage, viz., “Loose Leaves from Olivet,”
dated “Jerusalem, 1857,” and “Nile Glances.” “Nile
Glances” is purely descriptive of the Nile trip. It is
interesting description, but crude poetry, disclosing no
indication of the latent genius of its author :
A glance on the past, when we wandered awhile,
Borne on the breast of the sunbright Nile,_
Leaving Winter behind for a Summer fair,
Drinking new life from the balmy air.
It consists of eighty lines, and remains unfinished.
“Loose Leaves from Olivet” comprises nine verses of
haphazard metre savouring of the influence of Tennyson
and disclosing an orthodox religious earnestness. The
opening verse runs—
Not the mere name of it, —
Not the mere fame of it,
No more a mere story or vision of air,
But Olivet’s self , parched, solid, and bare,—
Olivet, mountain of iveeping and pray’r ;
Bethpage—Bethany—
Kedron—Gethsemane —
Eastward and westward behold them all there l
J*
When the Leylands returned to London and
settled down, Stephens left them, and in 1861 became a
teacher in the Greenock Academy. A student in the
Academy at the time supplies the following : “ Well do I
remember his tall, thin figure, clear-cut and almost
feminine cast of features, his genial smile and winning
ways.” He took an interest in the boys not only as a
pedagogue and taskmaster, but as a private friend.
The senior class used to meet at the house of the
headmaster on Friday evenings, where Stephens joined
in reading Shakespeare’s plays, each of us taking a char-
acter. Private theatricals were arranged, and Stephens
used to drill the boys in their parts, and train their
elocutionary powers. On one occasion he wrote a song
to be introduced in “ Bombastes Furioso,” which we
were rehearsing. On a later occasion he himself took
the part of Sally Blunt, the Irish maid of all work, in a
piece, when his long figure and rollicking acting caused
the whole play to go as an immense success.”
By this time he had developed into a writer of
verses for Sharpe’s Magazine and Chambers’s Journal.
He wrote also for newspapers, and printed two short
stories entitled “Rutson Morley” and “Virtue Lemoyne.”
Some of these Greenock verses which have been preserved
are serious, and some are written in the lighter vein that
was later to reach its highest development in “ The
Godolphin Arabian” and “My Chinee Cook.” But he
suffered from rheumatics and decided to emigrate to a
warmer climate. On the 28th December, 1865, he left
Gravesend in the Blackball liner Flying Cloud, bound for
Brisbane. Aboard the same vessel was Horace Earle, the
present secretary of the Johnsonian Club (Brisbane). In
the “ settling down ” process these two came together and
formed a close friendship that existed up to the day of
Stephens’s death. Mr. Earle describes him as having a
middle-age appearance at that time, “ looking, in fact,
very little younger than when he died,” although he was
then only‘3o years old. “He made very few friends
during the voyage, was well-liked by the passengers—a
good conversationalist, and very entertaining."
The Flying Cloud arrived in Moreton Bay on
the 30th April, 1866. Landing in Brisbane, Stephens
went to stay at Kangaroo Point with a cousin—a Mrs.
Hill, wife o‘f Walter Hill, first director of the Brisbane
Botanical Gardens. Within a week he delivered a lecture
on “ The Antiquities of Egypt ” in the Brisbane School of
Arts, which occupied at that time the present site of the
Queensland National Bank. The lecture is described by
one of the audience as “interesting, but not well
delivered.” He tried for various positions without suc-
cess, and meanwhile .took pupils at evening classes at
Kangaroo Point. One of his pupils was Robert Philp, a
lad destined afterwards to become Premier of Queens-
land, with Stephens as his Under-Secretary. For a little
while he held the post of proof reader on the Guardian
newspaper, and later, published a MS. Pmich in con-
junction with J. A. Clarke, artist, etcher, etc., which ran
into three issues.
In 1869 he went to Tamrookum as tutor to the
Barker family. Tamrookum was a cattle-station on the
Logan, 6C miles from Brisbane by road. He was allotted
a bed and sitting room in the bachelors’ quarters. “ I
am by a jollv log fire,” he writes to his Kangaroo Point
friends. .. “ repeatedlv interrupted. One of the inter-
ruptions waS not * hor-e ’ hut ‘ dog ’ —a family affair. ‘At
Tamrookum on the 10th ins(., under Mr. Stephens’ bed,
Tiny, of five pups—mother and children doing a great
deal better than they deserve.’ ” The bush depressed
him, and although the Barkers were kind to
him he was lonely and miserable. His heart was
back at Kangaroo Point with the Hills and Earles,
and the Donaldsons and Clarke, and the genial com-
pany and the warm hospitality that he had become
accustomed to. “I feel as tender and homesick as I
used to do in my school-days when the holidays were
over,” he wrote to Horace Earle ; “ I picture you all
sitting to-night under the bright lamps . . . and Don
Quixote and the ‘ Pussy, pussy, come to baby,’ and all the
rest of it, and I wish, I wish I were with you in body as 1
am in spirit.” Again : “ Oh, how sick I was at dinner
to-day with horse, horse, horse, and it will be horse,
horse, horse day after day for six long months.” And
again : “I am still fretting against the bush. What has
roused me to-day is seeing M and B going off to
Brisbane. I am in the land of monotony ... deep in
Euripides. W was here on Saturday and Sunday,
and all was horse, horse, horse. • —— is here to-night,
and I literally fled from the drawingroom to avoid the
eternal horse, horse, horse.” His Tamrookum letters
contain commissions of all sorts, ranging from boots and
troupers to Adams’A iniquities and Homer. In onehe relates
how he tendered his resignation as a protest against the
repeated removal of his charges to help in the station
work, and of how his pretest prevailed, and his resigna-
tion was withdrawn. In another occurs this significant
item : “In case anything goes wrong about posts pre-
venting you from hearing from me ere the beginning of
the August mail for England, please send registered a
draft for £l5 on the Koyal Bank of Scotland to Jane
Stephens, 32 Ann-street, Greenock.” He was always a
good son and brother, and to the day of his death con-
tinued to help his people.
Jt
It was at Tamrookum that “Convict Once”
was produced. It was written in three weeks. As was
his custom, the MS. was first submitted to his Kan-
garoo Point friends. Horace Earle sent it to Professor
Masson, then Professor of Literature in the Edin-
burgh University, afterwards first editor of Macmillan’s
Magazine. Masson kept the MS. for six months before
reading it. Afterwards, he wrote to Stephens’s sister
statibg that when he started to read it he could not leave
it down until he had finished it. He adds : “ That young
man, a tutor in the Australian bush, is a remarkable
poet.” Stephens was elated at the verdict. In a letter to
Earle he writes : “ Oh, my dear old boy, read the accom-
panying copy of a letter from Professor Masson, and, by
your gratification, judge of mine. I give yon my word
of honour lam taken by surprise. I really and truly had
given the thing up as halt, maimed and rotten.” But he
continues: “My head isn’t turned, boys. The tug of
war is to come yet. Macmillan the Rhadamanthushas yet
to bring the commercial judgment to bear. But even if
nothing else comes of it I am exceedingly gratified.”
Macmillan was slow to move, and many weary months
went by before his decision was received. “ Macmillan is
still silent,” Stephens from Tamrookum; “My
sisters have n’t had a single line from him. As you may
suppose, lam in a devil of a rage about it. As I have
told you before, I could stand a flat rejection with perfect
complacency. But to have one’s hopes stirred up to
boiling point and then allowed to flicker month after
month —why I’d much rather not have had them kindled
at all, or else have them trampled out at once: ... If I
were faithfully to put on paper my feelings with
reference to the matter, you would see expressed
in black upon white my fervent wish that Macmillan
would go to the devil and take the MSS. with
him. . . . But it’s always the way, Horace, whenever I
go beyond my plain school-mastering vocation I merely
lay up for myself stores of disappointment. Therefore I
say once more, Vive la birch ! Poetry he blowed ! W ould-
be authorship confounded !—and may everybody go to the
deuce except ourselves and our fellow-creatures.”
Ultimately, Macmillan undertook to publish Convict
Once. Professor Masson read and corrected the proofs.
It was most favourably received by the English critics,
but was not a financial' success. Freni Tamrookum fol-
lowed verses in lighter vein— “My Chinese Cook,” “My
Other Chinese Cook," “ Ode to a Black Gin,”—and a year
later “ The Godolphin Arabian ” appeared. Well-meaning
friends had said to him after the appearance of Convict
Once, “Yes, it’s very fine, Stephens; but why don’t
you give us something racy of the soil —something
horsey?” “So I sat down,” he once told a friend, “and
crammed myself with Stonehenge’s Rural Sports and
other works on the horse, and produced ‘ The Godolphin
Arabian.’ My horsey friends were delighted. “That’s
the sort of thing that will take,” they used to tell me.
In May, 1870, he wrote to Earle, telling him of an
offer he had received to contribute to a new paper which
was starting in Ipswich (Q.) “I think I’ll have a shy at it,”
he says. “It may lead to summit. In fact, if I only had
subjects I’d keep plying the newspapers in all directions
till I come down, so as to get a chance at some occu-
pation by and bye.” Three months later he excuses
himself for not writing “ owing to the barrenness of the
Tamrookum soil. This week it is as unpregnant as ever.
Mr. B will be home in a month, and if he has any
other arrangement for the boys, I may be going adrift
altogether. Whichever way it is decided I shall n’t be
sorry. I think I’d rather be cut adrift on the whole and
compelled to make a push, for this here life is mere
barren ease and unprogressive monotony.”
At times he rode into Brisbane from the station.
Returning once, he left the track and passed a wet night
lost in the bush. Finally he left Tamrookum and secured
an appointment as a teacher in the Normal school,
Brisbane. He held the position a while, and left it
to return to the bush as tutor to the family of
Captain Sherwood at Unumgai station, on the Richmond
River. A while later he was back in Brisbane again, and
secured a prize of £lOO offered by the Queenslander, then
edited by Gresley Lukin, for a serial story entitled “ .A 100.”
It was his first and only novel, atid he was never very
proud of it. It appeared afterwards in book form. Later
he went to Stanthorpe as a teacher in the State school.
The local colour of the tin-field inspired his “Quart-pot
Creek,” “A Lost Chance;” and a fork of Byron’s, the
property of Colonel Pitts, a resident of Stanthorpe, gave
rise to the verses on that theme.
Jt
In Brisbane, in 1876, he married Rosalie
Donaldson, whose family formed one of the Kangaroo
Point circle, and whose sister married his old friend J.
A. Clarke. Men of Stephens’s temperament too often have
made mistakes in marrying—it is sufficient to say that
Stephens married the predestined woman. Shortly after
his marriage he was appointed to the Ashgrove State
school, near Brisbane. Here he did much writing
for the press. The Melbourne Argus, Punch, and
Australasian published many of his pieces ; to the
Brisbane Courier he became a regular contributor of
light matter; while writings such as “ Marsupial Bill,”
“ Roley Poley,” and “ Christmas Night in the Museum,”
illustrated by his friend Clarke, popularised the Christ-
mas numbers of the Queenslander. At Ashgrove three of
his children were born, and there he remained for six
years.
Jt
During this period Sir Arthur Kennedy was
Governor of Queensland. His daughter, Miss Kennedy,
had a great admiration for Stephens as a writer, and
interested herself in him. “ Cannot you find something
better for such a genius as Brunton Stephens,” she said
to Thos. Mcllwraith, then Premier, “ than a country
school—some position in which a man of his gifts would
have better opportunities of developing his great
talents ? ” The result was that Stephens was shortly after
transferred to ,the Colonial Secretary’s office as corres-
ponding clerk. At a later period he became chief clerk
and ultimately Under-Secretary in the Chief Secretary’s
Department. In his altered capacity he served the State
for 21 years. He died on the 29th June, 1902, from a
heart trouble, and lies buried in the picturesque South
Brisbane cemetery. His widow and'’five children—four
girls and a boy—survive him.

SETTING AUSTRALIA TO MUSIC
“ Puck ” complains that “L.B.’s” article, “An Aus-
tralian Pastoral Symphony” (21/2/3) described nothing
distinctively Australian beyond the black swans and the
mopoke ; and suggests a symphony based on “ the big
plains of the interior” or “fern gullies,” “gum-trees,”
and “the death-like silence of Aust. mountain scenery.”
“ L. 8.” replies at length, and points out that “Puck ” “for-
gets that a symphony is a work of sound, not of silence. His
‘ silent-plain-and-wind-through-she-oaks symphony ’ is
the easiest thing in the world. Here it is : Orchestra of
eighty performers, two thousand bars rest. Sole per-
former, the drummer, who is producing the 1 wind
through the she-oaks ’ by' placing a large sheet of paper
upon one of the tympani and rubbing it with a brush.
Would such a performance fill Melbourne Town Hull ?
Even Saint-Saens’ Desert has a charming oasis in it.”
The case is judged in “L.B.’s” favour, of course:
England (which “ Puck ” compares) has not the charac-
teristic components of such a musical scene as “ L. 8.”
described. And “ L. 8.” adds these further notations of
Australian bird and insect cries :
WHEN SCOT MAULED SCOT
Thomas Carlyle’s family has smarted for twenty
years over the picture of Carlyle left by Froude’s pen ;
and two volumes of New Letters and Memorials of Jane
Welsh Carlyle have just been published to set down the
wife’s share of the Carlyle household strife. In truth she
was the “ bitter little woman ” that Rossetti called her :
her pen ran vitriol. This passage from one of her letters
of 1845 will interest our Gov.-General—
Did you know that Alfred Tennyson is to have a
pension of a year after all ? Peel has stated his
intention of recommending him to Her Gracious
Majesty, and that is considered final : “ A ehaqu’un
selon sa capaciU!” Lady Harriet told me that he
wanted to marry ; “must have a woman to live beside ;
would prefer d lady, but—cannot afford one ; .and so
must marry a maid-servant.” Mrs Henry Taylor said
she was about to write him on behalf of their house-
maid, who was quite a superior character in her way.
The venom of it! Yet conceivably Jane Carlyle might
have been happy and kindly. Her life went awry
simply for want of a Highland family of sixteen or so ;
and the barren woman’s hysteria permanently clouded her
br jas. Crichton-Browne, w’ho introduces the New Letters,
refers to Froude’s treatment of his hero thus : “He ex-
ceeded all editorial license in his manipulation of the
documents placed in his hands, suppressing what seemed
incompatible with his own views, and even sometimes,
it is difficult to believe inadvertently, altering the text in
a manner favourable to them.”
“ Carlyle and his wife,” says justly a Lond. Book-
man reviewer, “ resembled each other much too
closely. They were both neurotic, irritable, fussy, and
to the' last degree cruel and uncharitable in their judg-
ments. Both had an extraordinary gift of expression.
Both were essentially Scottish peasants. They were
childless, and for many years of their life they were poor.
The chief sting of their poverty was that it indicated the
world’s coldness and lack of appreciation. However
much they affected to despise these, they were in reality
very sensitive. The wonder is not that they quarrelled,
but that they did not separate for ever. As it was, their
married life, all things considered, was an amazing
success. There can be no doubt that they re-
tained through all a strong affection for one
another. Of the two, Carlyle was by far the
nobler, and it is only fair to Fronde to say that he
fully recognised this. Mrs. Carlyle was altogether on
a lower plane intellectually, morally, and spiritually.
There is even reason to think that Carlyle’s hateful
habit of disparaging everyone was derived from his wife.
Whether or no it is undeniable, and must permanently
affect the general estimate of his character. As for her,
no one was ever safe from her tongue.”
Bayard Taylor, the distinguished American who
englished Faust , sent a copy of his version to Car-
lyle,' and presently called at Chelsea \ th a friend.
They found Carlyle in a cab, and Froude was just getting
in. There were recognitions all around. All who knew
Carlyle’s ways were aware that a cab ride with him was a
great functidn, and must not be interfered with, but a
little talk before the ride, with Froude at the cab door
and Carlyle inside, promised a delightful moment.
Taylor said to Carlyle he hoped the copy sent of his
translation bf Faust had been duly delivered. “Ay,”
was the answer ; “yon’s the eighteenth presentation
copy of translations of Faust they’ve sent me.” Then
the cab drove off.
BOOKFELLOW’S MIXTURE
A paragraph of penance. Lionel Straehey’a
complaint of Mrs. Ward’s new novel was headed “Lady
Bose’s Dullness;” and Lady Rose's Daughter is not
merely not dull : she is absorbing. The tedious
moralities, the pulpit discourses, the conscientious
platitudes of the Mrs. Ward we knew cast hardly a
shadow over her. The author of Lady Rose’s Daughter
is a new author entirely.
But. . . she is not Mrs. Humphry Ward. Three-fourths
of the plot and five-sixths of the characters of Lady
Rose’s Daughter are conveyed straight from the letters
of Julie de Lespinasse, an 18th century Parisian with
wit and a history. Julie Le Breton, Mrs. Ward’s heroine,
is Julie de Lespinasse writ large in English ; and the lady
of fiction is surrounded by precisely the same people
that played havoc with the life of the lady of fact. Mrs.
Ward has furbished old phrases and emotions, transferred
characters to a London society where they do not belong,
and added a typical Ward ending. That is how the book
made; and, for_ convenient comparison, publisher
Heinetnann has supplied a new edition of the Lespinasse
Letters, so that paternity can be traced point by point.
The New York Tribune reviewed the facts, ranged the
Ijarailels, and declared that Mrs. Ward should have
icknovrjedged the paternity, and accounted for her
Hidden doffing of the dull manner. Mrs. Ward cabled at
ength that her sources were well-known, and that
she had made the clue cle>r by calling her heroine Julie,
and bv quoting.a passage from Mdlle. Lespinasse.'" The
Tribune retorted that, precisely because the debt was so
glaring, it should have been specifically paid.
Endorsed. Mrs. Ward’s way is a legitimate way of
novei-building; but since she has transfused fact into
fiction, not merely founded fiction on fact, she owed her
original definite thanks.
Lady Rose's Daughter is'uncommonly interesting,’ and
is commended to readers. But the interest is due first of
all to Julie de and only secondly to Mrs.
Humphry Ward. The blots that Strachey complained of
are the marks of tiie joiner’s chisel.
The biographical account of Brunton Stephens
on this page is the first complete smmmary to be pub-
lished. The writer, Francis Henna, author of Songs of a
Season, now member of Q. Legislative Assembly, was
among the number of Stephens’s personal friends. In a
following article will be given some account of Stephens’s
character and’ temperament, literary, political, and
religious opinions, as they appeared to one of his
intimate Brisbane circle..
In quitting his post on the editorial staff of
Sydney Telegraph, John Farrell closes a period of some
fourteen years valuable service with one proprietary.
During the greater part of that time he has been em-
ployed principally as leader-writer, and in addition has
contributed most of the Saturday notices of books. His
place will be taken by John Sandes, “Oriel” of Melb.
Argus staff. Both 'Farrell and Sandes have won reputa-
tion as writers of verse. Farrell’s Houi He Died, and
Other Poems was published in 188 V ; Sandes’ Rhymes of
the Times in 1898.
John Bull is an admirable brute; it is as a
canting brute that he disgusts us. Remember the tales
of “ the treacherous Boers ” who used soft-nosed bullets,
in retaliation for the Eng. soft-nosed bullets which John
Bull was silent about, but which even Conan Doyle had
to admit. Now we have the hypocrite’s cloak off in St.
James’s Budget of May 1, discussing the annihilation of
Col. Plunkett’s column by African Somalis defending
their country against the same old invader- Thus the
unabashed Tory—
We are all for humanity, of course ; but we do not
quite see where the humanity comes in of permitting
riddled and probably dying fanatics to hack our own
soldiers to pieces with spears before they collapse. The
point of exit of a dum-dum bullet is an ugly spectacle,
no doubt; but so is the wound of a shovel-spear ; and,
after all, we owe our first duty to the lives of our own
soldiers. Furthermore, if the native troops get to dis-
trust the power of their weapons to stop the enemy
they are likely to become unreliable. It is highly in-
I convenient, no doubt, to be obliged to keep two
separate supplies of small-arm ammunition ; and the
Boer contingent may possibly snigger to see us “slosh-
ing ” the 'Somalis with the kind of bullet over which we
raised such a virtuous howl when they were used against
us. But no considerations of this kind can stand against
the paramount importance of providing the troops in
Somaliland with that kind of “ gun-medicine,” to use
the expressive Malay idiom, which will enable them to
do their work most quickly and effectively.
'..'rue; and just as true in the mouth of John Bulls
pponents. Then why the “virtuous howl”? Because
ant is the Briton’s birthright : and canting pays.
Variation

after Darwin,
that there is a
greater general
variability
from type in
the male sex
than in the fe-
male. Ellis
now politely
retorts the
in his favour. It is one side-issues
of science, but on so slight a pe# we niaj r ‘ & takes

DR. McLAUGHLIN’S ELECTRIC BELT
THE MODERN
INVIGORATOR
Makes a sick man well and a weak man strong. It is simple, but grand. There is nothing so penetrating, nothing so invigorating, nothing that will relieve weakness and pain as
speedily, so surely.- It assists Nature by a general reinforcement of the vital energy by infusing a mild, invigorating current of -Electricity into the nerves, and by supplying the
system with the very essence of Nerve Vigor and Nerve Strength. Electricity is the only rational and certain cure for functional disorders. If your BACK ACHES, if you are
NERVOUS, if you have RHEUMATISM, LUMBAGO, INDIGESTION, STOMACH or KIDNEY TROUBLES, ELECTRICITY, properly applied, will cure you. There
is no doubt about it. It cannot fail. It quickens the pulse, invigorates the blood, puts new life into eveijy nerve. We have over Twenty Years in the study and application
of Electricity, anti the results have produced the marvellous invention with which we are curing thousands daily.
f|9~ DO NOT BUY AN ELECTRIC BELT UNTIL YOU HAVE ABSOLUTELY DECIDED TO TAKE NO MORE DRUGS.
Desperate with Sciatica.
Angel Terrace, Coolgardie, W.A.
Dear Sirs.—l got your Belt after all the doctors here had given
me up—after all the hospitals had passed me as an incurable. I
had Sciatica so bad that I could neither work nor walk. I wore the
Belt two nights and the pain stopped. In a week I had no pain
and began to mend. In a month I was out again prospecting, and
I would like to meet a man more grateful to you than I am. I
don’t think I ever will. p . w . KELLY .
Cured in Thirty Days.
Waterfall, Kybean, via Nimitybelle, N.B.W.
The Dr. McLaughlin Co.
Dear Sirs,- I am very pleased to say my health has greatly
improved since I have worn your Electric belt for thirty days. The
pain in my back has gone, and my food digests well. I am not
troubled with palpatations of the heart or heartburn from which
I suffered great inconvenience before I wore your Belt. That
weary feeling has left me to a considerable degree, also that bash-
ful feeling.—l am, dear sirs, your obedient servant,
O. H. ELPHICK.
Functional Decline.
Herbert, Otago, New Zealand.
Dear Sirs,—l am writing you according to your request and I
may say that I have derived great benefit from the use of your No.
8 Belt. I feel a different man altogether. The weakness has left
me and now lam alright and I feel strong and vigorous. I deem
your Belt a wonderful invention and I shall always praise it.
Yours very gratefully,
JAMFS FINLAYSON.
Don’t these letters astonish you? Also, don’t they make you stop to consider? Just think for a minute, here
are three letters from different parts of the country, they tell of wonderful cures, we have hundreds and thousands
more like them, grateful thanks for cures of all kinds of ailments. Have you any reasonable excuse why you should
not at least investigate this wonderful cure? You have none; it costs you nothing, so to-day, either write or call and
learn all about it. Hours 9 a.m. to 9 p.m.
WOTTCE.
Do not be induced by a “low offer fcr cash ”
to pay out any money tor a “BELT” which you
have been led to believe you could secure for
t'»e asking-. Write us for an explanation of
how Belts are sold “ FREF.”
BELT WITHOUT DRUGS
We do not advertise to sell you an Electric Belt and, when you come for one, tell
you that you don’t need electricity, that a Belt WITHOUT drugs is useless. We
insist that it is foolish of you to buy drugs. Drug treatment is exgonsiye and useless if you have a really good Electric
body ;
Appliance,
not made bj ° J an( j because a genuine Electric Belt cures without drug assistance.

The Riot of the Roada.
How l tire of rangeless reaches I how I loathe
these shapeless wastes —
Their sandhills, scrubs and arid waterways !
And my ears are sick of silence, and my eyes are
sick of Death,
Of the dry bones and the dust-wrack and the haze.
Ay ! I shrink from stricken Nature in her garni-
ture of woe,
And languish ’neath the wrath that all corrodes,
Till my heart is in a fever, and my senses all
combine
In a craving for the riot of the roads !
Let those who crave for Nature go and seek her
bony front
By the perished creek and dried-up billabong ;
Let them fight the lonely battle in her wilderness
of pain—
I d rather chance the pity of the throng
That crowds the busy highways of the biggest
city known :
At least no sable crow there broods and bodes :
O ! tis truly martial music to the ear that loves it
well—
The rattling, roaring rumble of the roads !
Hearts of stone within the city; trust and
honesty betrayed ;
Our daring dreams dispelled and bright hopes
vanished.
Yes, I know, and knowing choose it, for I ken the
bush land too,
And its baleful ban that never may be banished.
For the savage, silent contest ’gainst The Un-
known chills the heart
While the struggle ’gainst the tangible is meet—
”lis a faint heart falters surely when its beatings
beat in time
To the rushing, rolling music of the street.
Thus peace comes only to me when the day’s dull
toil is o’er
And Night the blighted bushland holds in thrall;
I hen in sleep, my soul, unfettered, takes in ecstasy
its flight,
And speeds to where the distant cities call.
And I thread the teeming highways and view the
busy marts,
The crowded quays, the harbors with their fleets,
The while my heart is pulsing—full and happy—
keeping time
To the rolling, rumbling music of the streets.

LOUIS M.
Disillusioned.
To see the Maori in his home he came across the
sea;
He read him up, he learned his myths, he learned
them carefully.
Now first he saw an old brown hag who sat and
smoked a pipe,
A blackened clay. “I’ll speak to her, this old
’un, fully ripe.”
He hummed and hawed—but, hang it all! a man
must have a try.
“E pou/” he said (“Old woman,” that) "Epou!’’
he caught her eye.
“ Term koe I” —she removed her pipe—“Tena
koe: very dhry ! ”
She lifted up a skinny hand and pinched a
withered throat
(An intimation, very like, that smoke doth thirst
promote),
“Tena koe” means “good-day,” he thought—
again he caught her eye ;
“Tena koe” still she said and grinned; “Tena
koe—very dhry ! ”
He met a young man (Maori too, though dressed
in pantaloons);
Thinks he, “This fellow is not parched by half a
hundred moons.”
(They reckon time by nights, not days, in Maui’s
Fish, you know.)
Then once again he hummed and hawed, and
“ Here’s another go.”
“ Tena koe/” “Oh ! good-day; good-day,” the
Maori youth replied.
“ He’s up to date,” thought he ; and then another
tack he tried :
“Do you remember Maui’s tricks and how at
last he died ?
How first he held the burning sun and made him
run more slow,
And then he hauled a mighty fish from ocean’s
ebb and flow ! ”
“No fear! the parson says it’s lies—all lies and
fairy-tales.
I b’lieve that Josher held the sun, and Joner
swallered whales! ”
He went. He met an aged man who bore a staff.
“ A chief,
I’ll bet my hat,” thought our raw youth; “I’ll
tackle him.” In brief,
He tackled him. Was he a toa?—a famous old-
day hacker ?
“I’m civilised /” the old man said; “have you
got any ’baccer ? ”
He had no ’baccer, and no breath to tell the old
man so.
He went, and with a heavy heart he murmured,
‘ ‘ ’Taint a go ;
There are no Maoris here, I think, in all the
bloomin’ show.”
The aged men, the youths, the squaws, past all
he hurried by :
“Tena koe, pakeha! ” they cried; continuing,
“ very dhry ! ”

English hangman Billington is a barber by
trade, and carries on business at Bolton ; he is
said to be a good tradesman, too, except for his
habit of stopping to muse reflectively upon a cus-
tomer’s neck in the middle of a shave.

BAD COMPLEXIONS
Dry Thin and Falling Hair'and Red
Rough Hands Prevented by
CUTICURA SOAP
ILLIONS use Cuticura Soap, assisted by Cuticura Ointment,
for preserving, purifying, and beautifying the skin, for cleans-
ing the scalp of crusts, scales, and dandruff, and the stopping
of falling hair, for softening, -whitening, and soothing red,
rough, and sore hands, for baby rashes, itchings, and chafings, in the
form of baths for annoying irritations and inflammations, or too free
or offensive perspiration, in the form of washes, for ulcerative weak-
nesses, and for many sanative, antiseptic, cleansing purposes which
readily suggest themselves to women, especially mothers, and for all
the purposes of the toilet, bath, and nursery. Cuticura Soap com-
bines delicate emollient properties derived from Cuticura Ointment,
the great skin cure, with the purest of cleansing ingredients and
the most refreshing of flower odours. No other medicated soap is to

skin, scalp, hair, and hands. No other foreign or domestic toilet soap,
however expensive, is to be compared with it for all the purposes of
the toilet, bath, and nursery. Thus it combines in One Soap at One
Price, the best skin and complexion soap, and the best toilet and
baby soap in the world.

thickened cuticle; Cuticura Ointment, to instantly allay itching, inflammation, and
Irritation, and soothe and heal; and Cuticura Resolvent Pills, to cool and cleanse the

The Landlord and the Federation.
Practically the only objection urged against
the Judicature Bill in the House of Repre-
sentatives was on the score of economy.
Those Tories who, in the absence of a
Federal High Court, see an impunity for
such lawless offenders as Victorian Premier
Irvine ; those agents of the importers who,
in their bitter unpatriotism, object to a High
Court as removing the last chance of the
customs swindler escaping scot-free ; those
Conservative enemies of Federation who
still prattle about State rights and dodder
over the “ tyranny of the union ” —all com-
bined to put forward the plea of economy as a
reason why the Federation should be left in-
complete, without its most necessary member
—the Judicial Executive of its Acts of
Parliament. There were divers things
in their hearts but a single argument
on their tongues —that the financial position
of the Federation is at the present time
somewhat embarrassed, hampered by the
Braddox clause of the Constitution and by
the disinclination of the State Governments
to re-cast their taxation and expenditure
systems to suit the new condition of affairs ;
that Australia cannot afford a Supreme
Court of its own, and should be con-
tent with any sort of an undignified
and inefficient makeshift. Economy is
a truly admirable thing in its proper
sense, but it is not “ economy ” for
a miserly person to hoard up gold
whilst denying t£> himself the necessaries of
life, or for a municipal government to
let filth accumulate in its streets to save
the cost of scavenging. Nor is it economy
for a nation to allow its most important
power to be exercised in a slovenly, undig-
nified and faulty fashion for the sake of a
small saving. It is folly, and folly of such a
kind as must inevitably end in worse results
than would follow a course of reckless prodi-
gality.
* * * *
Whilst not admitting, then, the smallest
degree of validity to the plea that, for
economy’s sake, the Federation should dis-
pense with a High Court, or set up a Court
insufficient in numbers or badly paid, it
must bb recognised that there is a certain
claim ta attention in the statement that the
Australian- Government is within measur-
able distance of financial embarrassment. The
cost of Federal services has already exceeded
the early estimates, and seems likely in
the near future to very much exceed them.
This is not because of any prodigality in
Federal administration ; so far there has
been rather a tendency to parsimony ; the
salaries attached to many responsible
positions are too low, though they may be
too high for some of the persons filling
those positions. But there has been, since
the framing of the Australian Constitu-
tion, a marked growth in the Federal idea
and a consequent increase in the functions
of the Australian Government. This
growth is a matter for congratulation, and its
continuance will be the best possible augury
of national w r ell-being. The more the
governing power centres in the one Govern-
ment which is truly representative of the
Australian people, and which is able to
legislate for the whole continent, thus avoid-
ing injurious differentiations as between
State and State, the better for the Common-
wealth. Nevertheless the financial difficulty
is becoming a very real one. The Federa-
tion does not, as yet, use the full proportion
of customs taxation to which it is entitled by
the Constitution ; but it is approaching to
that limit. And the present tariff probably
marks the extreme limit of revenue-raising
capacity. An increase in its rates (which
increase should, and must, come in the near
future as a better protection to native
industries) would mean less revenue, because
it would curtail imports and customs revenue.
Further, even supposing that a little more
tariff revenue could be gathered in, the
Federation would be able to use a fourth of
it only —the other three-fourths going to the
State Governments. Under all the circum-
stances, a betterment of the customs revenue
as a means towards putting the Federation
into a sounder financial position is not worth
discussing.
* * ♦ *
Yet the Federation must have more reve-
nue or neglect solemn duties, and let slip
out of its hands golden opportunities. In
addition to the expense of the High Court,
it will shortly have to make provision for a
High Commissioner, an Interstate Commis-
sion and an Arbitration Court. Federal old
age pensions must also come ; the Common-
wealth can hardly tolerate a system by which
its citizen in one State is granted a
fair allowance in his old age, in another
State a mean and grudging stipend doled
out in the spirit of Bentism, and in
yet another is left to starve. Nor will the
National Parliament, as it awakens to a
sense of its responsibilities, be content to
stand by whilst the various States run a
wild and reckless race to the pawn shop :
it will find itself compelled to take over the
State debts and also to adopt the hitherto
unheard-of policy in Australia of paying
them off. And all these things, courts,
commissions, pensions, sinking funds, will
require money—more money than is at all
likely to be at the command of the Com-
monwealth Treasurer under present condi-
tions of taxation. The Australian Parlia-
ment may get out of the difficulty by
refusing to undertake the duties which
demand its attention. But that would be
a dishonorable, and, ultimately, a bitterly
prodigal way out. Remaining in Egypt
would, ou the whole, have been a cheaper,
easier method of life for the Israelites than
trekking on an arduous path to the Pro-
mised Land. But they did not adopt it:
they had too good an eye to Business.
* * * *
The only alternative —and the alternative
which must be soon faced—to a policy of
lazy inertia and dishonorable neglect of its
duty, is for Australia to search out other ways
and means of obtaining revenue. It is argued
in Tory circles that, because the Australian
Government has the customs revenue, it
should leave all the other sources to the
State Treasurers. To which there are three
obvious answers : That the Australian Go-
vernment was given power to impose any
sort of tax, presumably so that it might
exercise that power ; that the Australian
Government has not the customs revenue
but only one-fcurth of it; and that it is use-
less to leave to the State Treasurers the
right to impose taxes which, so far, most of
them have shown no disposition to impose.
The most needed tax in Australia for
financial and economic reasons, and the most
honest one, is a heavy impost on land values,
graded so as to fall more heavily on the big
landlord and most heavily on the big
absentee landlord. Such a tax commends
itself for its honesty in the first instance,
because the greatest part of the responsi-
bility for the financial embarrassment of
Australia rests with the land-owning class,
which has, at one and the same time,
retarded settlement (and consequently
population), and piled up a huge foreign
debt for the purpose of increasing the
value of its estates by railways, roads, and
other public works. It commends itself as
providing a ready means of collecting a fairly
large revenue, which the Federal Treasurer
could reserve entirely for Australian pur-
poses, free from the operation of theßr addon
clause. But most of all it commends itself
for its economic effect in forcing the land
into use and in breaking down the barriers
which land monopolists have erected around
great holdings, received in the first case as
gifts, brought to enormous value by the
efforts of the community, and held still in
jealous reserve in the expectation that
further unearned increment will accrue, or
else leased out under rack-renting conditions
to poor teriantrfaYmers,
♦ * *
So valuable would be the effects of a land-
tax, exempting the small, poor holding and
making its exactions higher and higher as
the huge land monopolists and rack-renting
abs ;ntee landlords are reached, that, even
were there no financial necessity for extra
revenue, the Federation should take steps
for its imposition. The work cannot be left
to the States. In every State there is a
Second Chamber with powers of veto rang-
ing from the strong to the absolute, and
devoted almost exclusively to the land-
owning classes. The N.S. W. Upper House
is, of all the Australian Second Chambers,
the most Liberal, the most enlightened, the
most representative of the electorates, yet
it still represents in the main the land-
lord element. The Victorian Second
Chamber is at the other end of the scale —a
House absolutely monopolised by the land-
lords, narrow, intolerant, stupid, actuated
by no other consideration than the guardian-
ship of wealth. Their Upper Houses make it
practically impossible for the Australian States
to undertake the radical legislation which the
evil of land monopoly demands. The land-
lords will never consent to legislation w r hich
makes landlords disgorge any appreciable
share of their plunder from the public purse,
or relax to any appreciable extent their
throttling grasp on the throat of the com-
munity. But the Australian Parliament has
no such obstacle. Its Second Chamber is
not a House of Landlords, but a
body elected on as full and demo-
cratic a franchise as the House of
Representatives. The Australian Parlia-
ment alone can effectively grapple with the
problem of landlordism, and is called to the
task not only by the necessity of revenue,
but the necessity of national progress.
♦ * * *
To the Australian citizen who believes in
his own country, who does not agree with
the cowardly, whining cry of the borrowing-
importing gang that Australia is only fit to
be a low-wage country dragging a few rough
products from a reluctant soil, there is no
more sorrowful symptom of national sloth
and carelessness than the growth in this
continent of a landlord system matching in
iniquity that of England, and even Scotland
and Ireland. With manufacturing industries
of its own and easily accessible land,
Australia can grow to be a great country ;
without them —both are vitally necessary
—it must steadily degenerate into a poor,
dishonest, sponging country, irredeemably
pledged to foreign money-lenders, and sunk
in a slough of stagnation. It is the mission
of the National Parliament to open up for
the Commonwealth both these paths to
national greatness, and the means in one
case is a tax on unimproved land values,
graded so as to reach almost the point of
confiscation in the case of huge estates
owned by absentees and locked up against
settlement. In truth, absolute confiscation
of such areas would not strike anyone
fully acquainted with the facts of Australian
landlordism as being at all inequitable,
for when the average big landowner of
the Commonwealth does not completely lock
up his lands against settlement, he allows
them to go into cultivation only on condi-
tions which constitute the cruellest “con-
fidence game *’ ever designed to rob the
poor and the unwary.
r * * * *
There is nothing more pitiful than the
sight of the Australian farmer in the grip of
the private landlord staggering with bent
back towards the goal of prosperity and
falling ever into the grave’s deep furrow on
the way. His life may be epitomised :
Man comes, and tills the field, and lies beneath.
Starting, perhaps, as a young and hopeful
man, fresh and vigorous, he takes up a little
piece of tillable land on lease ; the rent
which the landlord charges him is a mere
nothing. True, the land has to be cleared
and fenced and sown, and a dwelling and
outbuildings put up. But the rent is so low
that, with hard economy and labor pushed
to the ultimate point of endurance, he
and his wife can manage to get over the
first few years. Their time of comfort is
ahead, when there is no more clearing
and not so much of “improving” to
be done. Five years pass and the
prospect of prosperous times seems near
enough to be almost grasped, when the
landlord comes to renew the lease— on fresh
terms which leave the toiler in the same hard
position as before, with just a living left
after the rent is paid. The farmer, chained
to the soil into which he has put his best
years of labor, to which he has given its
main value, cannot leave it and must submit
to any exaction. He struggles on, with a
bare subsistence wage, until it is
time to give his last tribute to the
land, and leave a son or a neighbor
to carry on for the profit of the land
monopolist. The mirage of prosperity is
ever alluringly before the victim of land-
lordism. With the stimulus of a low rent
he at first works with a savage hope for the
future, and afterwards, as he finds the land-
lord’s exactions increasing, with a despairing
resolution not’ to be forced off the bit of
earth that he has baptis'd as his own with
the sweat olhis soul.
» » » *
It is a truly pitiful thing this spectacle, in
a] new country, of the agriculturist in the
grip of the landlord, nailed to the same
cross as his unfortunate brother in Ireland
and England. One may see the process
of landlordism in all its stages in Australia—
on the North Coast of N.S.W. where the
men are just taking up the land from the
monopolist and are full of courage and
hope ; on the South Coast of N.S.W.,
where the intermediary stage is being
reached of a tenant peasantry that blesses
the squire and all his relations because the
rents only rack moderately so far ; in the
Bathurst district of N.S.W., and many
Tasmanian and Victorian centres, where
the tenant is sinking to the position
of an absolute serf, or, giving up
the struggle in despair, is trudging
to the poor-house, leaving the land to
be tilled by Chinese. In this country,
barely a century old as yet, settled at a time
when the experience of older lands pointed
a stern finger of warning against landlordism,
there should not be a single land monopolist’
nor a single farmer paying tribute to any land-
lord other than the State. The duty of the
Australian—the National —Parliament is to
retrace the steps of the Commonwealth back
to that ideal. The legislative system inflicted
upon Australia by England allowed the
landlord class a tremendous political
power, and the growth of a system of
rapacious landlordism was the inevitable
consequence. The legislative system de-
signed by Australians for Australia does
away with a controlling House of Landlords,
and sets up a Parliament in which both
Houses represent the people, and the natural,
logical sequence of such a reform is the
destruction of the evils of landlordism. The
Australian Parliament is the only one which
can unlock all the lands of the Common-
wealth ; it is the only one which does not
need to secure the assent of the land-
lords themselves to the destruction of
landlordism. To the Australian Parliament
the people look for the Federal land tax.
As matters stand the State Parliaments—
mere subordinate twopenny legislatures of
little account—are by their land systems
driving away the Commonwealth’s subjects
and the Commonwealth’s taxpayers, and the
sons of the farmers are beginning now to
make for far-off lands in Canada and South
Africa, simply because, even in this empty
region, good soil is not available. If
the Australian Parliament won’t protect its
own people, to w'hom can they look for aid ?
PLAIN ENGLISH.
Customs Administration.
Customs Minister Kingston seems to have be-
come tired, the other day, of the Daily Yabbeb-
graph’s constant wails about the poor, honest
importer brought before an unfeeling police-court
for judgment, and asked that paper to come
and investigate for itself his customs administra-
tion. From a full investigation of the records,
this result was reached by the D.T. reporter:
Action taken by the Customs Department, New South
Wales, from July 1, 1902, to May 31, 1903, in connection
with misdescription of ad valorem goods and other errors
in entries, goods imported but not entered, concealed
goods, and prohibited goods :
Note. —Post entries, representing balance of duty pay-
able, have been allowed in cases where the error has first
been drawn attention to by the importers, where the
error has been in the rate or classification of duty only, or
where, if there have been no previous cases, the error
does not exceed £1 in duty involved.
What on earth possessed the Telegraph to pub-
lish these figures it is difficult to say, for it is not
the “ tradition ” of that newspaper to burst up its
own myths in such an effective way. The table
shows that of 586 cases so far dealt with there
were only 89 prosecutions; of these only six
failed. This will at once strike anyone conversant
with criminal statistics as showing that the pro-
secutions were undertaken very cautiously and
never without due cause. Taking offenders in the
lump, the figures for N.S.W. in 1901 were 58,681
persons brought before magistrates on arrest or
summons and 8457 of these discharged. bus,
roughly, eight in 58 ordinary cases fail, whilst
only six in 89 customs cases have failed.
The inference is that Minister Kingston is
far more reluctant to prosecute the fraudulent
importer than the courts are, in a general
way, to prosecute the general offender, and
doesn’t move anything like so rashly, but
there are other notable features in the return.
In 164 cases of obviously honest error there was
not one prosecution. In only one section of the
return (that of importing prohibited goods) does
it appear that more than 25 per cent, of offenders
were prosecuted. The return proves with un-
questionable certainty that the yarn about the
“honest importer” being dragged to the police
court is a lie. Yet the Telegraph, though it
publishes the figures, does not put on sackclot t
and ashes and bewail its past misguided expressions
of sympathy for the dishonest importer, or its crue
slanders of Kingston. No, it still cries Out against
prosecutions, and suggests some arrangement by
which they can be avoided. But the communit
will support Kingston in not making anysucn
arrangement till the importer leaves off swindling,
and in dragging to the open court importers wno
bring to this country obscene prohibited articles,
or who seek to defraud the customs. If they a
honest men they should not fear investigation.
If they are dishonest, it is well that they thou
get the police court brand.

The Descendants of the Pig-dealer.
Died suddenly last week, the royal family of
Servia. It is now exactly 99 years since t.
Servians rose in insurrection against their grin •
ing tyrants, the Turks, under the leadership o
Black George, a grumpy and morose cattle-
owner, reputed also to be a bushranger in m
spare time. The Servian war never attracted t
same attention as the Greek war of Independence,
mainly because no Byron ever made poetry ab-
it ; nevertheless it was a magnificent struggle
grander than any the Greeks ever put up.
three years Black George had freed Servia.


ten years be had lost Servia again and was a
fugitive. Then arose a still greater man,
Mjlosh Obrenovitch, Pig-dealer, who swept the
Turkish power before him and fairlv started
Servia on its new career as a practically free,
though nominally tributary, kingdom. Later, the
two leaders reached out for the crown and there
wasn’t enough crown for two. Obrenovitch slew
Kara George in a gory squalid fight in a public-
house, and thereby began a feud which has lasted
until now. The mighty Pig-dealer reigned for
26 years, but he drove his subjects as he used to
drive his swine, and at last they rose against him
and ejected him. His son Milan reigned about
nine months, with the Karageorgevitch faction
taking pot shots at him periodically ; and then he
died. The Pig-dealer’s second son Michael lasted
three years, and then the Karageorgevitch
faction (representing Black George’s descen-
dants) drove him out, and put on the
throne Alexander, son of the old man whom
Milosh Obrenovitch slew in the public-house
But after seventeen years the mighty old
Pig-dealer came back to the throne and reigned
till his death in 1861. His career fills nearly 50
years of Servian history. His son Michael took
another turn on the throne ; he was a great and
enlightened man, but the Karageorgevitch
faction shot straighter than usual, and he died.
Next came another Milan, grand-nephew of the
tremendous Pig-dealer who raised Servia from the
dust. Milan was civilised—the worst kind. He
was a cigarette-fiend, a pursuer of ballet-girls
with plump legs, an unlucky and squalid gambler,
a man who made war recklessly and came out of
it badly, an issuer of big proclamations, a person
of shabby domestic squabbles, and a gentleman
whose I O IT was known with disrespect in all the
gambling hells of Europe. Still there was a streak
of the tremendous courage of the old Pig-dealer
about Milan Obrenovitch, and Servia progressed
even jn his time. He was shot at occasionally by
the Karageorgevitch push, but their aim seemed
to deteriorate with years. Milan abdicated in
his old age, and went to gamble with marked
cards and some spare trumps up his sleeve in
various parts of Europe, and to be unfavorably
known as a man who bilked his landlady when-
ever possible. His son, Alexander, who came
next, was promptly shot at by the Karageorge-
vitch faction—which again missed. The marks-
manship of the Karageorgevitch crowd was
execrable. Alexander was a fussy man of
good intentions. He reformed almost everything
in a hurry. He married a widow much older
than himself, and they had rows. His wife,
finding she had no hope of giving birth to another
Obrenovitch, tried to pass an adopted child off
as her own, and made a scandal. Alexander
was suspected of an intention to make his wife’s
obscure brother his heir, and the Karageorge-
vitch faction took fresh hope and oiled its gun.
He suspended the constitution, and quarrelled
with the army, and made more honorable and well-
meaning fuss, and the Karageorgevitch faction
felt glad and loaded its gun. Finally, last week
the army rose and slew the young King and the
middle-aged and ended the Obreno-
vitches. Peter Karageorgevitch, a remote
descendant of the man who was killed in a public-
house nearly 100 years ago, will apparently get
the throne, and the long feud is presumably
ended. King Alexander killed one man in the
scrimmage which ended in his death. The family
had degenerated. His ancestor, the mighty Pig-
dealer, would have wiped out twenty.

The Public Demand for Loot.
The Sydney Telegraph strikes about the bottom
limit of degradation with this notice :
TO COUNTRY READERS.
Owing to the enormous demands made by the Govern-
ment of N.S. W. for the Carriage of Newspapers by Train,
amounting to Eight Times as much as the freight charged
for corresponding merchandise such as milk, the Pro-
prietors of the Daily Telegraph cannot send extra copies
of the paper “ on sale or return ” to railway towns ex-
ceeding 150 miles from Sydney. Readers who may
require the paper are therefore requested to order it from
the Newsagent in Advance, so as to avoid disappointment.
The Proprietors of the Daily Telegraph
have in the past cheerfully borne the losses resulting
from unsold copies of the paper, and would be glad to do
so still, but they cannot in addition undertake to pay
freight charges which, in some cases, amount to more than
a penny per copy.
Considering that the Federal Postal Department
will carry the Telegraph to any part of Australia
and Tasmania for this statement about being
compelled to pay “ more than a penny per copy ”
is specially gorgeous. The Telegraph has now got
down to about the level of the ruffian who tries to
extort money by threats. It makes no disguise of
the fact that the See Government can expect no
quarter from it while the See Government refuses
to subsidise it at the cost of the taxpayer by carry-
ing its wares free. All it is asked to do is to pay
the freight that has long been fixed by law, and
which is only one-fourth of the usual parcel rates,
and that very moderate and strictly legal demand
has roused all the falsehood and slander that is in
the sordid paper’s constitution. Openly and
unashamed it lets it be known that it wants to be
paid, and that it is reviling the See Government
because it isn’t paid—at the country’s expense.
As a rule the man who wants the public money
for his own pocket has the decency to ask for it
privately, but the Telegraph howls at the street
corner and on the house-top.
Wanted, a Dignified High Court.
The Bulletin does not believe in spoiling a ship
for the sake of a ha’porth of tar, or in the economy
of giving a working horse three measures of corn
when its constitution demands five ; and, accord-
ingly, plumps for a Federal High Court of five
Judges. Such a court is necessary for the pre-
servation of the Federal Constitution and the
enforcement of the Federal laws. Since the
Court has to act as one of original as well as of
appellate jurisdiction it does not seem possible
that its work should be carried on efficiently with
less than five Judges. A good deal of circuit
business will have to be done and, probably also,
industrial arbitration will claim at least a part of
the services of one of the members of the court.
Allowing one Judge for circuit work and one for
industrial arbitration, and taking into considera-
tion the fact that, were the Court composed of
only three members, the Full Court, sitting in
appeal on a decision of the Federal Court, could
only consist of two members and might find it
impossible to come to a decision owing to a differ-
ence of opinion between those two, the necessity
for five Judges is at once apparent. It may be
well to briefly outline the functions of the Federal
High Court, to show the mistake of arguing that
it will have probably little work to do. The Court
may supplant the Privy Council in all appeals
from a State Court; it must take the place of the
Privy Council in all appeals on constitutional
questions ; it must act as a court of appeal from
the decisions of any one of its members, and as a
court of appeal on questions of law from the Inter-
State Commission ; it has original jurisdiction
(i.e., it is a court for the first decision) in
matters arising under any treaty, in any
oreign matter, in any case in which the
Commonwealth Government is a party, in all
cases between States or between residents of
dmerent Sta.tes, and in suits of mandamus or pro-
hibition against Commonwealth officers. That is
a wide range of causes ; and the Commonwealth
provides a wide range of territory. A court
which has that amount of business open to it, and
winch may have to send a member to sit at Perth,
xlobart, Broken Hill, or Port Darwin, needs five
members. The objection taken to that number
• S T e . made on the ground of economy, but
in the bitter grudging spirit of the anti-Australian
party, which does not wish to see an effective
Australian court established, but would prefer to
exalt the British Privy Council, and to leave the
r ederal Government hampered by lack of judicial
authority.
“ Naval and Military Experts."
Victorian Gov. Clarke’s lecture on the Imperial
naval subsidy, t’other night, caused Crouch,
M.H.R., to ask Premier Barton if he would
intimate to Chamberlain that the meddling of
State Governors with Federal politics was not
desirable. And Barton declined, adding the
strangely futile explanation that several of the
State Governors, who were naval or military
experts, favored the Imperial naval tribute pro-
posals. No doubt they do, but it is a pity Barton
didn’t explain what possible bearing that has on
the case. A State Governor has a right to favor
anything he pleases, including the abolition of the
Barton Ministry, the abolition of Responsible
Government and a return to Crown Colony rule,
the re-introduction of the convict system, the
gagging of the press, Freetrade, and the Victorian
railway break-downs. But he has no right whatever
to meddle with theself-governing powers of the Aus-
tralian people by advocating any one or other of
these things, and any Governor who begins to
openly favor naval subsidies or other such matters
thereby perpetrates an insolent outrage on all the
traditions of his office, and a grossly unwarranted
interference with things that don’t concern him.
If Barton gives many more explanations like the
above he will begin to get himself disliked; he
won’t begin to get himself despised, for he has
arrived at that stage already. Of course a British
naval expert would be in favor of Australia con-
tributing towards the support of theßritishfleet, of
British officers holding all the dignified and profit-
able billets on the ships that Australia pays for,
and of the people in England running the show—
and even if he wasn’t in favor of it he would have
to say he was if he spoke at all. A Russian naval
expert would approve just as cordially of the
Australian squadron being controlled from St.
Petersburg—and the British fleet also, for that
matter. None of these facts would prove any-
thing whatever. Also, the matter in question has
a political as well as a naval side ; and the fact
that a man has walked fiercely up and down the
quarter-deck of a British ship for many years,
with a brass telescope under his arm, isn’t evi-
dence that he knows anything at all about the
political aspect of the case. It doesn’t go to show,
either, that he knows anything about naval ad-
ministration ; that he knows anything about the
necessities of Australian defence ; it doesn’t even
show that he knows much about war. It only
shows that he is an interested party with a tele-
scope under his arm. That applies to the naval
Governor who interferes with Australian naval
questions ; but if a purely military Governor like
Clarke attempts, however covertly, to advocate
the naval subsidy folly, then he doesn’t even rank
as the most obscure kind of expert. It is difficult
to say what he ranks as—unless it be some kind
of horse-marine.
The Minimum Wage.
The Victorian Factories and Shops Act expires
in October, and, it is announced, “ unionist
leaders fully appreciate the hopelessness of
securing the re-enactment of the measure. ” If
Premier Irvine passes anything at all it will be
“a very greatly modified Bill,” from which the
minimum wage provision will be absent. And if
this happens the event won’t be quite so regret-
table as it would have been a few years ago. In
the ante-Federation days Victoria maintained at
least moderate Protection for its industries ; but
in a moment of folly it sent the late Sargood,
and Fraser and Zeal and other political fools
and horrors to the Commonwealth Legislature to
whittle away that Protection, with the result that
the business of importing foreign goods is booming
again. Many of Victoria’s workmen are only
employed half-time or are not employed at all,
and the competition for bread is more
desperate than it has been for years.
Good wages necessarily add something to the cost
of production, and unless tlsere is sufficient Pro-
tection to make matters even between the well-
paid Australian and the miserably paid Hindu
and Italian, good wages simply mean the
destruction of the industry in which they are
paid. And that means a drop to no wages
at all. Let a minimum wage on the old
scale be introduced, or let any other fair
conditions of industry be re-enacted, and in many
lines successful competition with the foreigner,
under the whittled-down tariff for which certain
Victorian members are partly responsible, be-
comes impossible. In other words, competition
with the cheap foreigner under the low Federal
tariff is, in many lines, only possible by working
in much the same way as the cheap foreigner
himself works. Wherefore, if we insist upon a
minimum wage law for our own people under
present tariff conditions, we simply insist that in
many industries the cheap foreigner shall have
the work to do. And apparently, until wiser coun-
sels prevail, and the cry of the Pumpkin Smiths
and other advocates of the foreign sweater is some-
what allayed, things will remain this way. If the
foreign boss pays his workmen only 20s. a week
and we think our workmen should get 405., then,
as we can’t control the foreign boss, we can only
put them on even terms by seeing that the
foreigner’s goods are, in some way or other,
weighted with the extra 20s. before they reach
us. A customs law is, in itself, the first
half of a minimum wage law; and it is the
only sort of law which will make decent
wages and conditions in Australia possible.
Therefore it doesn’t matter so much just now as
it did a year or two. ago whether the Victorian
minimum-wage law is re-enacted or not. The
first thing that Victoria must do is to eject
every Freetrader and low-tariffist from its bit of
the Commonwealth Parliament and bend its
whole soul towards getting a higher tariff. When
it has got that it should lay its whole soul towards
getting a minimum wage law for all Australia.
In the interval there will be a period of suffering
and low wages, but the State’s industries will
be preserved, and wages will be raised again—
when the new tariff and the all-Australian Fac-
tories Act come into force. If the old minimum
wage law could be enacted while the low tariff
lasts, the result in many lines would almost cer-
tainly be a closing up of industries and no wages
whatever. It is a cruel dilemma, but the world is
full of cruel dilemmas, and nothing is gained by a
refusal to recognise the situation—the only thing
is to start at the beginning by shifting the callous
ruffians who are hi red in our Parliament to
damage Australian industries for the benefit of
foreign manufacturers and traders. At the same
time, two tilings must be recognised : (1) A re-
duced minimum wage, which would still be better
than the old sweating conditions, is possible, and,
if that is not granted, it is so much the more to
the discredit of the present Victorian Govern-
ment. (2) The Irvine-Bent hostility to the
minimum wage is not based on any of the con-
siderations above set forth, but on the grudging
meanness of two petty tyrants, whose sympathies
are with the worst kind of sweater all the time.
Irvine and Bent may be only doing what is, to
some extent, inevitable, but they were just as
anxious to do it when it wasn’t inevitable. Also,
there is a difference between doing a cruel act
from sorrowful necessity and doing it because one
feels that way.

Be Alleged Senator Beid.
The Bulletin has received the following letter
from Senator Higgs, of Queensland :
In re a portion of your last week’s leader : There are
several men in the Senate who would publicly take up
the Robert Reid case if they felt sure of their ground.
There is no question of unworthy fear in the matter. The
most intense disgust at Senator Reid’s entrance was
expressed by several senators privately ; and, during the
swearing-in ceremony, one senator spoke in his usual loud
whisper something about “outrage” and “fraud.”
Another, just. before Reid concluded the oath, said,
loud enough to be heard through the chamber,
"and, pay the customs taxes.” Still, no motion was
tabled for a variety of fair reasons. A statesman whom
you greatly-respect suggested that it would he unwise to
“ make a martyr of him.” What weighed most with me
was the remembrance of the Bradlauoh House of Com-
mons case. The high ground taken by those who, while
not agreeing with Bradlaugii’s views on religion, favored
his admission to the House of Commons, was that he was
the representative of his constituents. Incontestable
ground, to my mind.
We are a Senate composed of six representatives from
each State. Senator Reid presents himself as one of the
representatives of Victoria, and is not disqualified under
any one of the five sub-sections in clause 44 of the Con-
stitution. The sub-clause which more nearly approaches
his case than any other is sub-clause 2 :
“Is attainted of treason or has been convicted or is
under sentence or subject to be sentenced, for any
offence punishable under the laws of the Commonwealth
or of a State by imprisonment for one year or longer.”
But although the Robert Reid firm was convicted of
fraud, its members were not sentenced to imprisonment.
The firm was fined £5O and costs. Can we under
the Constitution expel Senator Reid? Have we any
right to censure the people of Victoria for electing
him their representative ? True, he was elected by the
Victorian State Parliament, but so far not a single public
meeting has been held in Victoria protesting against his
admission to the Senate. Even if public meetings unani-
mously denouncing him had been held throughout coun-
try and town, I do not think we could do otherwise than
allow him to sit as Victoria’s representative so long as he
is not disqualified by any clause of the Constitution or of
the electoral law of the Commonwealth-. No doubt the
reason why there has been no strong public Victorian
agitation in connection with the case is because the
general public are satisfied to wait until December next,
when they will have an opportunity of pronouncing their
verdict at the ballot box.
There is, in all this, a total and most amazing lack
of allusion to the question that is really at issue.
The Commonwealth law provides that no person,
while a member of a State Parliament, is capable
of being elected to the Commonwealth Legislature.
The law doesn’t make any distinction as to
whether he is elected by the people or elected by
the State Parliament. Premier Irvine, by way of
deliberate insult, nominated a disqualified person,
and he was illegally elected—by a majority over
Peacock and Barker. When a man is illegally
on Senator Higgs’s premises, does be lekve him
there so as to avoid “ making a martyr ”'oLhim ?
And does the fact that Robert Reid, belongs to a
firm that has been convicted of swindling its
country give him a right to break the electoral
law which a person with a perfectly clean record
doesn’t possess ? If the Senate is not going to
enforce its electoral laws it had tetter cease
making such laws.
Re that statement by Queensland Premier Philp—
There were some things at Atherton which I did not
like. A number of men who are crying out for a White
Australia have taken land from the Queensland Govern-
ment at 2s. fid. an acre, and they are sub-letting it to
Chinamen at £1 an acre. Now, these men were loudest
in their cries about White Australia, and no black men or
Chinamen in Australia. I think that that country ought
certainly to be reserved for the white race.—
Philp here, without a shadow of evidence,
assumed that the men who sub-let their land to
Chinamen were not his own nigger-loving push,
but the White Australia party. But since making
the above statement he has been reminded that in
1900 the Labor and White Australia party in
Queensland Parliament moved that the sub-letting
of land to Asiatics should be prohibited, and the
motion was defeated by the Philp party, Philp
himself crying out bitterly on behalf of the Chow
sub-lessee. Now he lays the blame of his own
action on his political opponents, which is just
like Philp.

The oareful collection of the Federal rolls reveals
some remarkable electoral anomalies in South
Australia. In Port Adelaide, the most thorough-
going Labor and Radical district in the State,
each member represents 6997 electors ; the
Northern Territory, which sent Sudden Solomon
and other all-wool Tories to politics, and votes
Tory every time, has a member for every 376. In
Torrens, Labor-leader Price and Coneybeer re-
present each 6329 electors; Alexandra, where a
Labor man isn’t possible, has one member for
every 2436. Perhaps it’s only a coincidence,
but it is a curious fact all the same, that in the
districts which Labor men can win, or have a hope
of winning, it takes an average of 5750 people to
return a member, while in the districts 'which
Labor men can’t win it only takes 2200. South
Australia has one person one vote; but some per-
sons’ votes seem still to be worth twice as much
as the votes of other persons. If there was one
vote one value, the Labor element in S.A. Parlia-
ment would be more than twice as strong as it is.
•
“ Chasselas ” supplies this story, which is backed
up in every particular by newspaper evidence :
The Victorian railways, under the Muddle and Back-
bone triumvirate—the short, thick, ignoYant man who
yells, and the pale, impassive, glassy-eyed man with the
great white bone of a forehead, and the tall man with the
carefully composed epigram that smells of the midnight
oil in his pocket—are in worse confusion than ever. Even
the big dailies have to say things occasionally, and then
cases of gross sweating come to light. The fat stock of
the Kyabramites must be run on a charity basis by an
under-paid, under-manned railway service, whilst men
fall asleep at their posts, and the big smash is only post-
poned by wondrous luck. The station-master at Guild-
ford, during six days, was on duty 128£ hours, and con-
tinuously for a spell of 61 hours. He overslept himself at
last, was responsible for a serious break in the traffic, and
his case was “inquired into.” Stationmaster at Rosedale
put in 106 hours a week or 17J hours a day. Last week
on Ararat to Hamilton line stationmasters were con-
tinuously on duty for four days and nights. One of these
men complained to the Department and was accused of
insubordination, and the usual black mark was put
against his name. The aim of the unholy trinity of
muddlers seems to be to achieve the worst service on
earth, and barring one or two South American lines they
seem to have about got there.
♦
Vic. Lands Minister Taverner, who is making a
few mild efforts to settle people on the land, has
arrived, somewhat late, at the conclusion that all
efforts in this direction are futile unless the
Government has power to compulsorily resume
good land. The State long ago “bust up” its
inheritance by selling or giving away practically
all the good land it possessed, and the only areas
available nowadays are poor blocks in Various
inaccessible places. Taverner says his Govern-
ment is only too willing to buy and cut up estates
on which a genuine agriculturist can make a living,
but directly it suggests a purchase the private
owner runs up his demands to an absolutely
impossible figure. There are ways out, of course,
but the paralysed Irvine Government won’t
move. One way is a general land-tax, graduated
to bear more heavily on big estates ; power to
compulsorily resume big estates for closer settle-
ment ; and, say, half the proceeds of the lar.d-tax
to be set aside to form a fund out of which to pay
for the estates when resumed. If the Irvine
Government doesn’t like these ideas, then its
business is to suggest something else that will
equally meet the case. At present Victoria pre-
sents the ridiculous and insane spectacle of a
State, with only 14 people to the square mile,
from which the young generation of farmers are
flying because land is unobtainable. They musi
go and farm somewhere else, for Victoria can’;
offer them room. And Belgium manages to find
room for 589 people per square mile.

“Alba” to The Bulletin :
T’other day when a band of Russian Jcw-balters
“dealt it out” to a Hebrew community at Kitcherniei
or some such place, old Rabbi Davis, of Sydney, lifted
up a voice that bled the hearts of his listeners. But
the Jew, in his anguish, is singularly impotent; with
both hands full of gold he looks skywards for help.
When writer heard the Rabbi recount how little Rachel
and Rebecca and the tiny Absalom had been hacked and
quartered he left the synagogue in quest of his buccaneer
friends to formulate a plan for the annihilation of the
unspeakable Slav. It is in the blood of the Jew to lose
heart in the presence of calajnity and oppression. Yet a
combine of European and American Hebrews could stiffen
Russian trade. With a man like Waterloo Rothschild
at their head they could chase the last rouble out of
St. Petersburg, and compel the Don Cossack to pawn his
knout for a meal. When the Jew-owned papers started
to manufacture “ Boer atrocities” in the Transvaal they
gripped Bull by the hair and flung him at the Boer, but
in the matter of his own blood-drenched Rachels ai d
Rebeccas he stands out as a man with chalk knee-joints
and a cainel-like under lip. When cash is in question he
is strong enough to hurl two little Republics to the far-
end of Gehenna. Enough said. Still, it seems to writer
that the long arm of Retribution has stretched across tl e
Dutch children’s graves to rest upon the Absaloms ard
Receccas at Kitehernief. Meanwhile Moss Moss and Ji b
Benjamin are shaking tremulous fingers at the Czar
And the bear blinks and licks his paws

When Reid gets back in office—when the snow-
ball starts to boil.
When he waves his rod enchanted —when he
twirls his magic dog
Shall the wheels of State run sweetly, Parlia-
mentary cam and cog.
There will be no jars, no trouble—so the Georgian
Gospel saith—
There will be an end of tooth-ache and finality of
death.
All the stars shall shine far brighter, roses blush
a warmer red
When Reid gets into office —and Job rises from
the dead.
There will be no droughts nor floods then, there’ll
be silken hats for all;
We shall eat in golden inangers, we shall tread
a marble stall.
There’ll be free rides on the railroad, in the cab
and on the tram,
And the poor shall daily banquet on champagne
and fruit and ham !
All the pubs, shall give free drinks then, kine
shall chew a special cud
When Reid gets back to office—when the Tank
Stream is in flood.
There’ll be loans to pay the baker, there’ll be
credit at the store,
And the butcher will cease saying that he’ll call
with meat no more !
Bathurst-burr shall cease to flourish, weeds shall
droop their dying heads ;
There’ll be food for man and woman and the other
quadrupeds.
Earth shall be a perfect Heaven—wondrous things
will come to pass
When Reid gets into office—when the wind turns
into grass !
Crops shall grow a cubit higher; girls will wax
far plumper then,
And six eggs be laid in concert by the ordinary
hen !
Boots will cease to make us suffer ; we shall feel no
grief nor pain ;
Every man shall own a motor and a fine gold
watch and chain.
And Australia shall be filled with joyful songs by
many a bard
When Reid gets back to office —and when Sheol
freezes hard.

J. C. Williamson concludes his season of
musical comedy at Sydney Royal, this week,
with “The Belle of New York.” As remarked
here some weeks ago, all musical comedy is Girl
of some sort; but the New York sort of girl has
more tune in her than most, and she even
threatens occasionally to have a story. The cast
is much as it was 12 months or so ago. Fred.
Graham is still the astonishing Reformer from
Cohoes, and the crowded house last Saturday
night knew so well where his songs—or chants, or
whatever they are, “Be as like us” and “Per-
haps”—came in that it began to titter before-
hand. Arthur Crane is still a mild young man
for such a devil of a fellow as the Reformer’s son ;
Maurice Dudley, though he only sings two
syllables, adds much to the gaiety as the polite
lunatic; and the other things that, after 48
hours’ reflection, seem worth remembering are
Miss Digges’ pert and vivacious Fifi, Miss
Rose Musgrove’s reasonably satisfactory “ Belle,”
and the shake of Fred. Leslie’s foot. .The
“ Belle” owes part of its popularity to what it is,
and part to what it was. In the old long ago,
when Oscar Girard, now deceased, rose before the
public eye as Ichabod Bronson of Cohoes, he built
a joke round the play that will not soon die.
* * * *
Next Saturday Cuyler Hastings and
return to the Royal to play “Sherlock Holmes”
for a week, and when that coldly impossible man
ceases to leave his burning cigar on the mantel-
piece in the cellar there will be a one-week revival
of “ If l Were King. ’
* * * *
At Sydney Lyceum Wm. Anderson con-
tinues his career as a doubtful reformer ; every
night at something past 9 Robert Inman is on the
verge of d.t’s., and at something to 11—a sober and
a contrite man—he is marrying the girl he ought
to have married shortly after 8. Still, if he had
married her then, “ Man’s Enemy ” wouldn’t have
been possible, and Anderson would probably have
continued to play “The Face at the Window,”
the prize horror of recent years. “Man’s
Enemy,” without being as horrible as that, is still
sensational enough for any ordinary glutton, and
is, besides, less rankly impossible. “Night Birds
of London ” will be the next thrill ; and the
public remembers these birds as very dissipated
fowls indeed. The change takes place on Saturday
night.
# * * *
Rudinoff, who made his first Sydney ap-
pearance at the Tivoli on Saturday, convinced
the audience at once that he was an entertainer of
singular talent. As a lightning sketch artist, his
work is facile and singularly humorous (a pre-
sentment of “his friend, Mr. Cohen,” in which
the letters of the name are made to serve as the
outline of a typical Hebrew face, is an epigram
in crayon); his “smoke pictures” are novel and
entertaining; and his whistling representations of
birds in ulay and love are full of quaint
and skilful mimicry. Since Cinquevalli there
has not been such a clever and amusing
entertainer at the Tivoli. The programme has
been graded up to keep it somewhat in coun-
tenance with Rudinotf’s merits ; Halleu and
Fuller, from America, contribute a comedy sketch
after the manner of the Drews —not as well done,
but still brightly and acceptably; and a “long-
felt want ” is supplied by a picturesque ballet.
Miss Fanny Powers and Edward Ford contribute
other good “ turns.”

Some of the star-dust that tenor Lloyd
left behind him has been kneaded into a com-
bination and called by its potter, Mr. J. C.
Williamson, the English Concert Co. It will give
one concert in Sydney, at the Town Hall, next
Saturday. Besides Miss Foxcroft (contralto),
Peterkin (basso) and Miss Mukle (’cellist), the co.
has Miss Nairne (soprano), Arthur Mason
(organist) and Herr Scherek (pianist).
* * *
Miss Maggie Moore’s season at Sydney
Palace proves, by its success in such a familiar
piece as “Struck Oil,” that lady’s strong popu-
larity. On Saturday “A Widow from Japan,”
which is not so familiar as the “Oil” drama, will be
staged. This country has suffered a good deal by
reason of Johnny Sheridan’s widows—the Irish
ones who arrive in a motor car from Chicago—and
it hopes that the one from Japan will be of a
different type.
* * * *
“ Madame Sans Gene,”as presented at Her
Majesty’s (Melb.), last Saturday, reveals no
unsuspected greatness in the Daniel Frawley co.
The “Secret Service ’ performance, though not
at all brilliant, was a fairly interesting treatment
of a Civil War drama in which the stage manage-
ment and the Amurkan accent are half the battle.
“ Madame Sans Gene,” a spectacular comedy of
the “ Sweet Nell ” class, is a more difficult under-
taking. The Broughs formerly staged it in their
best style with several clever artists around them,
and if Melbourne co nplained—as it did complain
—that the bright work of those old favorites
was faulty, what shall be said of the present
inferior revival of the same play by a visi-
tor who trumpets its praises in advance?
This is the original English version of . the
French “Sans Gene,” disfigured by cheap, broad-
comedv elaborations in the name part. The same
lively young laundress becomes a middle-aged
duchess, and sauces Napoleon’s sisters, and strikes
the Imperial tyrant speechless by reminding him
of his unpaid washing bill. But Miss Van Buren
seems a mere exuberant amateur in the character,
as compared with what Mrs. Brough was, or Mrs.
Bland Holt might be. Her acting wants force,
finish, sincerity. Her talk grows tiresome, for
she talks out of tune with her subject, just as
Miss Edith Crane did, bringing out all the defects
of American accentuation with none of its effective
points. She doesn’t even look Sans Gene, for
the duchess in 1811 is younger than the laundress
of 19 years before. And her labored antics to
raise a gallery laugh are sometimes contemptible
and always unconvincing. The play gets a lift in
the third act when Frawley’s figure of Napoleon
comes to light. Frawley doesn’t fulfil the expec-
tation of a startling Napoleonic make-up, but he
easily resembles the portrait of the Emperor in
many respects where Brough didn’t, and he gives
a plain, sturdy performance. Harrington Rey-
nolds (of the American contingent) makes his
local debut as a plump, quiet Lefebre, Duke of
Dantzig, the model of a flunkey in his court suit.
Other men—including Plimmer, who plays a
small part and would be better placed as De
Neipperg—are either passable or otherwise, and
all the company, bar Nap., are temporarily extin-
guished when Miss Susie Vaughan takes the
floor as Queen of Naples. A typical American
play, “Arizona” (by the author of “In Miz-
zoura”), follows “Sans Gene.” The season has
three more weeks to run, and “ Arizona ” can’t
happen too immediately.

Except in the d.c., where the seats of the
scornful are only moderately well filled, “As You
Like It ” seems to be a pretty solid attraction at
the Princess’s. Another fortnight is all that’s
left for the season of W. Shakspeare’s peaceful
comedy, therefore Melbourne will do well to hurry
up and admire the beauties of stage nature before
they go on tour and lose their early bloom. In
the truthful words of the text, this thing is done
“ on a scale of magnificence never before attempted
in Australia.” Public patronage is now being
weighed in the scale, and, if it is found wanting,
Musgrove will, presumably, reduce his magni-
ficence down to the comprehension of a one-eyed
community in future ventures. Meanwhile, the
mighty fine show continues to put up a Mel-
bourne record for dramatic landscape pictures
with figures in them. The company is enjoying
good healthas usual, and evilly disposed characters
get converted every evening. Venerable Adam,
who blows like a winter wind on the subject of
his green old age, because he never drank any hot
rebellious whisky in his youth—Adam, the lusty
Rechabite, invariably threatens to die of fatigue
when Orlando puts him to the test, but he never
fails to postpone his decease when he reaches the
banished Duke’s luncheon, and hears Kenning-
ham sing. The song puts new life into
Adam seemingly. He is fainting for food
when they dump him down beside the
frugal banquet, but he forgets to eat any-
thing of late. For the first night or two
he used to pick a bit, and then he dropped the
practice and found refreshment in listening to
Kenningham. Athol Forde is an impressive
Adam, armed with the tall clothes-prop of a
blameless life. Good men are addicted to leaning
on clothes-props for support. The early Christians
in the “Sign of the Cross” were the founders of
the custom. These few remarks must not conclude
without a sweet allusion to the improvement in
Miss Rosalind Kerin’s performance. When the
importance of being earnest has impressed itself a
little more deeply upon her fair young soul, Miss
Kerin will be the Rosalind of a Shakspeare
Society’s dream.
** * #
Bland Holt’s “ Breaking of the Drought ”
has come to stay awhile at Melbourne Royal.
Nothing really booms in Melbourne since the
Black Bent Saturday when the engine-drivers
suspended traffic, but the “Drought” drama is
getting all the prosperity that offers. The city in
general warms towards the bush fire, and is
impressed by the symbolical limelight of blue
ruin which falls upon father and mother Styan
and daughter Frances after the dear old home is
burnt out. Somehow, Walter Baker contrives to
be of little importance in this strange, eventful his-
tory. He overhears a conversation in the first
act, but things go on the same as though he had
heard nothing at all, and. although he finds the
money to buy a coffee-stall for his mother-in-law
elect, Baker is but a second-rate hero at the best.
His morals are doubtful. Just when the girl he
loves is drinking champagne and coquetting with
a nigger at the haunt of sin, Baker strolls in
casually and is shocked to find her there, so the
audience is left to suppose that if she had not
been there he would have found another girl, not
so respectable as the one he wasn’t looking
for. Styan, as the elderly burnt-out squatter,
is a conspicuous success; so is Miss Ross,
as the girl who feigns wickedness. Also
Brown is a good sketch of a nigger from the
’alls, and Albert Norman repeats his own familiar
kind of villain, instead of introducing a new
pattern. Why not a bronzed, heavy, hairy-faced
villain for a change? Bland Holt, in the absence
of Mrs. H., plays a lone and lively hand as a
rouseabout and reckless patron of the coffee-stall.
Brunton’s artistic performance of the Sydney
scenery gets great applause, especially the bush
tableaux, Mosman’s Bay, and Coogee, where Miss
Kellermann leads a procession of divers into
sundry feet of water.

“ The Lady Slavey ” jingles along satis-
factorily at Melbourne Bijou. Some of the music
is distinctly better than the rest of it, which
descends to the comic-song class of composition;
also, the Cinderellian story is more humorous
than the dialogue. Good ideas, borrowed and
original, are crudely worked out in “ The Slavey.”
The chorus of creditors and the two bailiffs, mas-
querading as guests at the major’s carnival,
amounts to a good idea, and the capture of the
millionaire by the decorative daughter who
professes to do the washing up is felt to be a
matter of general interest to the company. That’s
where “ The Slavey ” has the advantage of higher-
toned musical comedies whose choruses are but
intermittent intruders on the gaudy scene. The
diamond in Sheridan’s shirt-front is now shining
as it never shone on the first night, since when,
the show elsewhere has got into better working
order.

The Boissetts, late of Sydney, started
their Wild West panto, at Melb. Opera House
last Saturday, and the intelligent dumb activity
of those eleven new arrivals seemed to hit the
popular taste in many places at once. Subse-
quently the Boissetts gymnasted with success, the
funny man of the party proving a more subtle
comedian than the average comic athlete. Another
strong addition to the Rickards bill was W. C.
Fields, for the first time in Australia. Fields is a
clever juggler who treats himself as a joke, and
doesn’t treat the joke too seriously. Whitburn
and other people incidental to the first part
contribute songs and gambols to the fund of
entertainment, which is just now in a verv
healthy state.

At Adelaide Royal, the “ Thieves ” who
call themselves thirty, but are in the flesh twelve,
gave way to the picturesque “Fortune Teller”
for last two nights of the Musgrove season.
Pringle and Mme. Slapoffski had put in a Broken
Hill concert engagement while out of the bill.
It is a somewhat risky experiment to run a six-
weeks season in Adelaide with only three plays.
At present Frank Thornton is “Facing the
Music ” with a quaint play which lasts about two
hours in fiction as well as in fact, and between the
acts of which nothing is “supposed to elapse’’ but
the 10 minutes actually required to elapse for the
purpose of getting a drink. The plot turns on
the bewilderment of one John Smith at finding
there actually is in the world another man of the
same curious name. Meanwhile, the short Tivoli
season of “Mistakes Will Happen” is already
coming to an end. The biggest mistake
which has happened is that Willoughby and
Geach took a house too small for the
crowds that want to see the real four-wheeler,
and the real straw, and the real dirty water
squirted into a gentleman’s eye. The Caledonian
Society (assisted by Maggie M‘Cann from Mel-
bourne) gave a rousing Scotch Night in the Town
Hall on the holiday ; and a somewhat up-country
family of Cunard Entertainers now occupies the
same building.

At Hobart Royal, in the last week in May,
the smiling face of Dick Stewart, ex-junior, was
seen again in the manager’s room, his cares this
time being J. C. Williamson’s Hastings-Chevalier
co., with “Secret Service,” “If I were King,”
“The Christian,” and “Sherlock Holmes.” If
J.C. wanted to keep his audiences select at
Hobart the prices were all right, for the playgoer
on the banks of the silver Derwent is jealous of
his silver coin, and looks at two half-crowns a lot
of times before he parts with them to old Tom
Jones at the hole in the wall. Melbourne and
Sydney prices are insulting things to the typical
Vandemonian. Nevertheless, the houses during
the nine days’ wonder of the Williamson
season were good, and meant money. “Secret
Service ” opened the season, and there was a good
influx of playgoers, who had seen Cuyler Hastings
as Sherlock Holmes and wanted to see him in a
less superhuman part. “ Secret Service ” ran for
three nights, as did “If I were King.” J. B.
Atholwood had a good show as the foolish, philo-
sophical, vindictive, humorous old King ; but why
on earth did he wear a red rosary round his neck,
like an order-collar? For two nights the
“Christian” stormed, and then the calm of the
petrified boss detective prevailed for a single
evening.

Writes a Melbourne critic :
Joe Blascheck, the little lame joker remembered in
Melbourne as a reciter of “ The Cockney's Seven Ages of
Man,” recent!}' wrote a letter to London Referee pro-
testing that the dearth of Australian actresses for the
British market is not due to their alleged “ objectionable
and horrible colonial accent,” but to the fact that they
get no encouragement from the local managers. In
proof of which Blascheck instances four out of five
successful Australian girls as having owed their oppor-
tunities to “the advantage of being the daughters of
their own managers.” Nellie Stewart, Essie Jenyns,
Lily Dampier, and Carrie Moore are the four
instances, Carrie Moore, according to Blascheck, bein«-
che “adopted daughter of Mr. J. C. Williamson.”
J.C.W., the managerial critic of the twang, has probably
hastened to disclaim the adopted paternity of Carrie
Moore’s peculiar accent. For the rest of Blascheck’s
letter, it is mostly written in ignorance. He says, “A
few Australian girls, despite the discouragement they
received in their own land, have obtained in England the
chance of proving their ability that was denied them at
home.” Yet the fact remains that no successful Aus-
tralian actress abroad, not even excepting Ethel Haydon
(now a back number), can say she didn’t get a good
show in her own country. Pattie Browne got
better parts with Brough and Boucicault than
she has achieved in England. Lilian Wheeler plaved
Desdemona to Rignold’s Othello before she had been two
years on the Australian stage. Alice Crawford was
recommended by J. C. Williamson to M‘Kee Rankin and
Wilson Barrett, who brought her to the fore ere
she went away with Barrett’s co. And Hilda
Spong, who is practically an exported Australian actress,
was the leading lady in Bland Holt’s co. when she was
still a mere girl. None of the three last-named artists
had the least suspicion of that “objectionable colonial
accent ’’ which disqualified so many other bright girls for
similar rapid improvement. They got on because their
elocution was worthy of their talent.
A Letter from Lyell.
George Mack writes from the copper region
North Mount Lyell Railway and Mining Co., owned
mostly by Australia’s creditors, has amalgamated with
Mount Lyell M. and R. Co., whereat is much rejoicing
among the Fatmen of the mining world. But among the
lean men is heard no sound of jubilation, the why of it
being thuswise. When the North Lyell built its much-
bungled railway, and erected its alleged smelters, and
opened flux quarries at Darwin, two townships sprang
up, one at Crotty and one at Darwin. Deluded by the
hope of permanent work, men brought their families
there, and built houses on blocks of land bought at boom
prices from the Tasmanian Misgovernment. All the
money they had, and all that the gross mis-
management of the North allowed them to
earn, they spent in improving their properties.
Stores were opened, hotels of brick and of wood
erected, and the people regarded themselves as
definitely settled. The reports that Crotty would be
abandoned were persistently denied, even after the
amalgamation was certain. Up to the very last Crott.v-
ites and Darwinites firmly believed that the smelters
would be kept going. Now there is weeping and lamen-
tation, for Crotty is not, and Darwin is not. All hands
have been sacked, and men who paid enormous sums for
land blocks on which to build what they fondly imagined
were to be their homes, now find land and homes value-
less. These people have no money. Few of the men
have put in more than half time for months past, and
as the stores are closed, and they must quit or starve,
their straits are sad indeed. It is almost impossible to
get work on the Coast, and the unfortunate have no
means of leaving it. The Tasmanian Misgovernment has
promised aid : but past experience of its methods has
taught the people that to wait for it means starvation.
Hundreds of men are thus thrown on the already over-
stocked labor market, and what the rest of the winter
will be like one shudders to think ; but of course, the
Fat Man will get handsome divs. from the amalgamation,
so what matter a few hundred workmen and their families
left workless and starving !
The bungling which was begun by the Tasmanian Mis-
government surveying and selling blocks of land for a
town site near Mt. Lyell smelters, and then surveying
another site, and selling more blocks, without, of course,
refunding money paid in first case, when the North Lyell
changed what served it as a mind and decided to erect
its smelters elsewhere, has had a fitting finish. Twenty
thousand pounds worth of property, belonging mostly to
workmen, has been rendered absolutely valueless; hun-
dreds of men have been thrown out of work at a few
days’ notice, and scores of men, women, and children are
actually starving through the shutting down of Crotty
reduction works. Little else could have been
expected. North Lyell management never exer-
cised the least amount of foresight over anything,
and could hardly be expected to do so now. When the
big smoke stack" was put up at Crotty, no one seems to
have even remembered that a lightning conductor it
usually required. It was remembered, though, when a
wandering thunderbolt came to earth eta the chimney,
and strewed the neighbjrhood with bricks. The new
stack is furnished with a conductor, and now stack and
works are to be abandoned. Perhaps the ineptitude of
the bunglers in charge was never so fully illustrated
as when two trucks of ore, valued at £l5OO,
were gaily kicked off on to the wharf at Kelly’s
Basin, and as no one had remembered to see
if the brakes would work, or thought of putting a dead-
end on the wharf in case they didn’t, the trucks shot
over into deep water. Then a heaven-sent genius of a
boss—North Lyell was full of them—got a lighter, and
sought to recover the trucks by dumping a huge anchor
into them in hopes that it would catch on something.
When the truck operated on was reduced to splinters,
divers were sent down, and the ore and truck wreckage
hauled to the top again. It was time Yankee Robert
Sticht got a hand in the game.
Mr. Critchett Walker, for many years
Principal Under-Secretary of N.S.W. and con-
fidential adviser of a long: line of Premiers—
Parkes, Dibbs, Reid, Lyne and See—died last
week of pneumonia. It was at the funeral of the
late J. T. Toohey that he caught the fatal chill;
old men should never attend funerals, young men
should attend theib as seldom as possible. From
the age of 16 to 62 Critchett Walker was a publio
officer, and, having much solid ability, he grew in
that time to be the ideal civil servant —methodical,
secretive, tactful, wedded to routine. There was
no rash experimentalism about Critchett Walker.
At various times he was offered a seat on the
Railway Board of Commissioners and the Public
Service Board, but he knew his groove and stuck
to it.
Melbourne Board of Health lately acquired
the pleasing information that that sink of cor-
ruption, Melb. General Cemetery, is so full that
even the footpaths are being broken up to make
room for more bodies. Meanwhile, the Springvale
Necropolis is yawning for its dead, but they can’t
get there because Bent refuses to open the Ceme-
tery line till he thinks it will pay. And as Bent
is unable to think, this deadlock may last in-
definitely.
N.S.W. Parliament opened on Tuesday
with mostly a moderate and colorless programme.
The question of reduction of members is to be put
to a referendum. Gov. Rawson read, without a
smile, a sentence in the speech which expressed his
advisers’ regret that they couldn’t feed the Free-
trade newspapers on subsidies any longer. No new
taxation is to be proposed. The Labor Party is
promised Bills (which are rather declaratory of
the law than enactive) removing the shadow of
the Taff Vale decision from trades unions, and
amending the Coal Mines’ Regulation Act so as to
make payment by weight compulsory in all cases.
James Ashton and other of the Carruthers
crowd are touring the women’s political leagues
now, telling them that “women’s franchise was
not a popular proposal in the See Cabinet.”
Anyhow, the See Government carried it, and the
Reid-Carruthers crowd only talked about it. The
Reid-Carruthers crowd and their fathers and fore-
fathers haven’t, in fact, been responsible for a
single large measure of electoral reform, though
nearly all the time they have pretended to favor
electoral reform. It was the Dibbs-Barton
Government, which included See and Kidd, two
present Ministers, that gave one-man-one-vote ;it
was the same party, 10 years after, which gave
one-person-one-vote, and these two measures are
the two most powerful instruments of popular
government in existence.

underground electric haulage plant, which was supplied
and erected about seven months ago by the Austral Otis
Engineering Coy., South Melbourne, sole representatives

Mr. Mephan Ferguson, of Melbourne, reports
that there has been a great improvement in the general
outlook of the engineering business since the new year
started, and that his pipe making works in Melbourne
and Perth are working full-handed. Amongst the orders
now being executed at Footscray works is one for 7 miles

The copper market, with none too promising an
outlook previously, is now, according to London Statist,
threatened by a new producer in Central Africa, which,
it is alleged, promises to be as big a thing in the matter
of copper as the Rand is in the matter of gold. J. R.
Farrell, a well-known ’Murkan mining engineer, who has
inspected, says that native workings prove
tons of ore in one mine alone, ana that the average
recoverable value is 15 per cent, metallic copper. The
district is northwest of Rhodesia, and the nearest port is
Benguela, in Portuguese territory.

The Wild Cat Column.
Sydney Telegraph grew desperate as the
opening of N.S.VV. State Parliament approached. A
few days before the event the paper wildly announced
that the See Government, out of pure vindictiveness had
put up the railway carriage rates so that they amounted
in some cases, to a penny on each penny paper. The
morning of the day when Parliament opened it wildly
declared that under certain circumstances it was being
charged five-pence freight on each penny paper. Quite
apart from the gorgeous discrepancies in these
narratives, the whole trouble lies in three pro-
positions : (1) There has been no increase in the
rates fixed by law ; the See Government simply intimated
alike to the papers which supported it and those which
opposed it, that the old legal rate must be paid --for a
number of years the law has been evaded. But the
intention was that the papers should simply pay a lump
sum —equal to one-fourth the regular parcel rate. (2)
The Sydney morning papers, long accustomed to regard
themselves as above the law, refused to pay except
“ under protest.” (3.) The Treasury refused to let any
bumptious newspaper obey the law only “under pro-
test,” and as the papers wouldn’t pay any' other way they
have (until they learn that the law applies to them in the
same way as to other people) to make their arrangements
with the railway authorities and stamp each parcel
separately and go to a lot of extra trouble.
The Telegraph s latest statement, by the wav,
••“ads thus : “ Under the scale of charges adopted by the
Cabinet for the carriage of newspapers by rail, a single
copv of the Telegraph sent to Albury, Cobar, Tenter-
lell, or Corowa would cost sd. The Postal Department
would carry five copies to any part of the Common-
wealth for a penny. But the postal arrangements in
New South Wales are so defective that little or no
relief can be obtained through that department, as
there are practically no morning mails in this State.”
And to most, if not all, the places mentioned, the Tele-
graph does send its papers (a special afternoon edition to
catch the night mails) through the post, and has done so
for manv years What’s the good of saying that a single
paper, if sent by rail as a parcel to a certain place, would
cost 5d., when it is not so sent, and never was. As well
make a grievance of the fact that a single tin tack, if
packed up by itself and sent on a camel to Greece, would
probably cost £5O.

the half-year were £182,176 (£152,040 capital, £30,136

The reserves still consist of a reserve fund of £22,500 and
a large floating balance of £8553. Why portion of it is
not transferred to the permanent reserve fund con-
tinues to be one of the mysteries of the institution.
The coin, bullion, and State securities held amount
to £150,051, as against £174,639 six months ago- that is,
about 25i per cent, of liabilities to the public, against
about 30 per cent. In consequence of this bank’s com-
paratively small capital and its comparatively smaller
reserves these figures fluctuate very much ; at'this time
two years ago they were as low as 19 per cent. Alto-
gether, though the bank is making steady progress, it is
slow progress; the reserves on May 31, 1893, were
£39,118,50 that the losses incurred just after that date
have not yet been made good.

This co. continues to pay the largest dividend among the
trustee co’s. of Australasia, and it also continues to have
no formal reserve fund—its reserves are “ balance
carried forward.” Most trustee co’s. appear to make
very little out of the trustee business ; what profits they
make are mainly from investments. This prosperous
co. could, however, pay about 8 per cent, dividend out
of its commissions alone.

The Victorian State Land Bank has raised its
latest loan at a figure which makes the interest £3 18s.
per cent, per annum. (Two years ago the bank could
raise money at £3 7s. lOd. per cent.) The bank lends
out to farmers at £4 10s. per cent., but expenses absorb
about 10s., therefore it really only gets, say, £4 per cent.
There is, therefore, at present rates, a margin of only 2s.
per cent, for profit and to cover contingencies, and as
this is obviously insufficient, and the margin is liable to
get smaller still, there is talk of a necessity for raising
the lending rate to 5 per cent. The misfortune of all
the State Land Banks is that they all depend
for their lending capital on borrowed money. The
true remedy is not to borrow money, but to supply the
necessary funds out of the State revenue, and as State
Treasurer Shiels now says he will have £40,000 surplus
(solely by reason of Turner’s careful financing and
Kingston’s careful collection of the customs revenue from
reluctant and unprincipled importers) he might hand
that over to begin with. This idea would involve the
wildly novel proposition that the State should have
some money saved and earning 4 per ceqt. interest, but
even that shock might be got over. If the State started
a sinking fund, and invested part of it in its land bank,
it would be a very good investment; when the State does
have a sinking fund (which is once every third blue moon)
•t yields much less than 4 per cent, as a rule.

Snow’s syndicate has dropped quite out of
P. 1 }' 3 ' lo notice now, and Adelaide citizens have given up
all hope of obtaining electric trams as a result of the
Act passed two years ago. Already an agitation has
been started in favor of either the State or the munici-
palities doing the work. The city and suburban councils
cannot come to an agreement even to build a drain, so
that the only chance of a better service lies in the State
taking the matter in hand. As for the syndicate’s lying
papers and politicians, who assured the people two years
age that the capital was available and that work would
commence immediately—well, they are lying low on that
subject; lying high on others.

The Queensland National, which took first place among
Australian banks in the matter Of interest earnings 12
months ago, has reached third place ; the Australasia and
the Westralia have moved ahead of it. The Adelaide
shows the most substantial improvement; after
that, the E.S. and A. But that probably needs
qualifying. The E.S. and A. makes up its accounts
annually, to June 30; the balance-sheet is available in
Australia at the end of the year. The figures for this
bank are, therefore, for the period from July, 1901, to June,
1902 : and that was part of the period oi the N.S.W. bor-
rowing boom, and before tire dull, grey drought settled on
the land. The increases shown by the Union and Aus-
tralasia are also discounted in the same way. The
banks which have increased their dividend are the New
Zealand (shareholders have now had the first taste since
the State rescued them nine years ago), the Australasia,
the E.S. and A., and the Victoria (ordinary shareholders).
Some other particulars follow. Banks which
make up their accounts yearly and those which do so
half-yearly are kept separate

Some of the troubles of the London Bank of
Australia are coming to light. The Victoria Brewery
(Melb.) owed it £154,000, and it smiled upon the pro-
posal of one of its officers to wipe the debt out. As
part of the scheme, the Melb. Brewing and Distilling Co.
was promoted, and trouble has arisen over that part of
the business. The debenture-holders alleged that the
prospectus deceived them, and threatened proceedings
against the bank as the real promoter ; and the bank,
which has undergone some changes in its high places
since the business was taken up, paid the debenture-
holders £21,000 to let the matter drop—a pretty bad con-
fession for a self-respecting bank to have to make.

S.A., which until a few years back depended
almost wholly upon Sydney for its supply of oranges,
found it could grow citrus fruits itself, and plunged into
the business without knowing much about it. The result
.is that, though remarkably fine fruit is being grown a
few miles back from the coast, thousands of trees which
were planted on the Adelaide plains, within reach of the
stiff sea breezes, have had to be rooted out. For all that,
there are now close upon 120,000 trees in bearing as
against 73,000 six years ago. But the outlook for the
industry isn’t very promising ; efforts to open up a profit-
able export business have so far failed.

The Westralian Government has a £lO,OOO libel
action on hand. Lately a perambulating Minister was
told that one of the mining wardens and magistrates had
a habit of borrowing money from people who were very
likely, at some time or other, to be interested in matters
before his court: and when the Minister, who by this
time had scented trouble and called, in a colleague, dug
deeper he was told that the warden had also got himself
mixed up in local mining leases. The warden’s defence
was that he wasn’t interested—it was his wife. The
next thing alleged was that the warden had recom-
mended the cancellation of a hospital reserve and its
addition to the ka«e in which his wife was interested,
and that on top of this, he recommended that the ground
needn’t be worked. This was followed by dismissal, as
the officer wouldn’t resign—he held that ail his
actions with regard to the hospital reserve and the
lease were defensible and above board. Over things said
by the Minister for Mines in the course of these ructions
a £lO,OOO writ has been issued.

Broken Hill Water Supply Co. has permitted
an independent survey of the quantity of water available.
The examiners (the local warden and another) found
less than there was when they previously took soundings,
during the threatened famine in Feb., 1901. At that time,
it was officially calculated there was three months
supply • so that there cannot now be more than six
weeks’.’ The mines and town may hang on a week or two
more by digging holes in the silt and draining it. This
is the nearest to the bottom the place has ever got.

British Broken Hill, as the result of recent

to this profit.

The paid-up capital (partly paid up out of profits) is
£76,088. The reserves are, in proportion, extremely
solid, but they are wholly used in the business, so that
whether they are worth what is set out depends upon
whether enough has been written off. Westralia is a pro-
gressive State, no doubt ; also, it has been booming.
And whether, in view of this boom, £2176 is enough to
have written off so far from hotel properties that cost
£107,165 is doubtful. Still, even making liberal allow-
ances on this account, a condition of gorgeous prosperity,
which reflects great credit upon the famous Westralian
thirst, is disclosed. Lately the co. has issued 20,290 new
shares at 255., bringing in £25,363, besides £20.290 pre-
mium, which latter amount has been added to reserves.
This issue doesn’t, of course, share in the present
dividend ; and the other consequences of the issue, in the
shape of addition to reserves, etc., are not shown above.
Opal-getting is still very slack at White Cliffs
(N.S.W.), though not as slack as it was. A few good
finds have been made under the band in ground that was
formerly abandoned and mullocked-up in Block 1., and
this is leading to more deep sinking.

The Tasmania G.M. Co. (Tas.), which on a
paid-up capital of £159,559 has distributed nearly
£BOO,OOO in divs., almost all within the last five years, is
now short of funds to carry on necessary development,
and alleges that the only way to get the money is to give
J. Bull more than half the property on condition that he
puts £160,000 into the concern. At the meeting held in
Launceston to consider the position it was proposed, in
opposition to the directors’ ideas, that the necessary
funds should be called up; hue that sensible
proceeding was voted down with extraordinary
enthusiasm—hv 45,692 shares to 3856. One of the
most remarkable arguments used to support the proposed
deal with J. Bull was that they “ would now have good
management.” As a matter of fact, with hardly an
exception, Bull-managed Australian mines have been a
ghastly failure ; in the few Westralian cases in which the
mines have been phenomenally rich and good dividends
have been paid, the management has still been disastrous.
All the same, it certainly couldn’t be much worse than
the Tasmania’s has been hitherto ; a co. which finds
itself stranded after averaging about 100 per cent, per
annum profit for the past five years, can’t very well be
succeeded by anything worse. The proposed English co.
will be in 500,000 shares, of which the present co. will get
210,000 ; £150,000 to he provided as working capital, and
the old eo.’s debts (about £10,000) to be paid off.

complete cessation of returns for quite a year. The pre-
sent equipment is also obsolete.

Cue G. M. and Exploration Co. (W.A.), a six-
times reconstructed wild cat, holding two leases known
as Kinsella and Last Chance in the neighborhood of Great
Fingall Consols, Day Dawn, has bought the discarded
mill engine and 20 head of old stamps from the Ivanhoe.
This machinery is now en route to the mine, and will be
ready for work in three months. The property’s main
shaft is down about 200 ft., but no ore has been devel-
oped, so that apparently the same old muddling that has
already ruined the co. five times is being gaily pursued.
After nine years of alleged mining no work has been done
even at 200 ft., and the property is unproved one way or
t’other. Being in a deservedly popular district, shares
are certain to be worked for all they are worth. As to
the mine, it is pretty certain to prove a failure, no
matter how good it may really be.
* * * *
Golden Horseshoe (W.A.) had a fairly good
year in 1902, though divs. only totalled 18s., against 235.
per share in 1901. Costs ran into 675., against 31s. of its
neighbor, the Ivanhoe. One reason for this is that the
Horseshoe smelts some 1500 tons a month, on which
smelting and transit charges alone tot up about £4 a ton.
The chief cause of the high costs has been the subsidence
of the whole of the original cyanide plant owing to its
having been erected on the cap of the lode. The creep
is within 20ft. of the old 50-head mill, hut the latter
is apparently on solid ground, and is battering away
gaily. The cause of the creep was that the boundary
lode down to the 200 ft. level was partly in Great Boulder
and partly in Horseshoe ground. The former co. took
out its portion of the lode first, and mullocked up the
ground. When the Horseshoe got to work this mullock
come in, and, in spite of all precautions, a creep occurred,
but the ground appears now solid. Ore reserves are esti
mated at 700,000 tons worth 26dwt. —-far the biggest
reserves of any mine on the fields. Preparations are being
made to duplicate the new mill, and also to send ore to
the Fremantle smelters. Probably the monthly output
will shortly reach 20,0000 z., and, when the new mill gets
going, the co. will easily be the world’s leading producer.
A feature of the mine is that all engines are duplicated,
so that a stoppage through a breakdown is next to an
impossibility. Dr. Krusch has just examined the mine on
behalf of the German holders, and Mr. Frechville for the
French ditto.
* * * *
Bellevue Proprietary, Mt. Sir Samuel (W.A.).
The new 40-head mill is expected to be running before the
end of the year, but very little in the way of ore reserves
is being opened up in anticipation. The co. is more than
paying its way with a 20-head mill, but the mine, possibly
through bad management, has belied all the fulsome
praise that has been lavished on it.
* * * *
Eraser South Extended (W.A.) reports a big reef
worth 22dwt. at 250 ft., and a smaller one worth 9dwt. at
300 ft. In face of this large supply of ore, the co.'s mill runs
eight days a month and treats 500 tons for 1600 z., or
barely 6£dwt. per ton. The gold is very low grade,
' being worth only £3 an ounce. Tailings are alleged to
be worth 6dvvt. If true, the mill is only saving half the
gold. The co. has now been toiling for seven years, and,
on Sept. 18, 1900, paid a miserable div. of 3d. per share—
or £1250. Since then it has twice increased its capital,
each time by the issue of 25,000 shares, and is now in
150,000 shares of £1 each. Mine is well equipped with a
30-head mill, cyanide plant, roek-breaktr, automatic
feeders, rock-drills, &c. That the management has been
bad goes without saying, as, in addition to £45,000 of
Bull’s money, the proceeds of all gold won have also gone,
all above the 300 ft. level. It is fair to state that the pre-
sent manager (Badge) only took charge lately, and haa
now got £25,000 with which to test his abilities In running
a mine.

“The most dangerous stage of a man’s ailment is when
he begins to nurse his nurse.” — Sage reflection.
THE INTRUDING WIFE: “My gracious vie, and
they reported him entirely out of danger only
this morning! ”
The drought continues. Last month’s
crop of infants in Sydney was the poorest for
this five-year period.
From an account of the cyclone at Towns-
ville written by the Bishop of North Queensland :
Those who have been face to face with death can under-
stand how we prayed, and we noted that the first break
in the clouds came within ten minutes of our prayer.
Here the old trouble crops up. A cyclone always
stops some time, and it always stops some ten
minutes after something has happened, whether
prayer is used or not; so does a drought, or a
flood, or a night, or a plague. Therefore, the
efficacy of prayer in these matters can never be
proved, nor disproved. It is all a laborious beg-
ging of the question. If the Church, by prayer,
could stop something that wasn’t bound, in the
ordinary course of things, to stop in any case; or
could start something that might, quite reason-
ably, never have started at all, then it would have
something solid to go upon. A range of mountains
10,000 ft. high, extending from Port Darwin to
Adelaide, would be a better thing to pray for
than rain, for they would supply rain perma-
nently. And their arrival after prayer would be
a proof that could hardly be set aside.

“ C.R.” on humorous remains :
The belief that a corpse has no humor must be revised.
One night recently the driver and fireman of the New-
castle to Sydney train slowed up at Epping Station and
reported that they had passed the body of a man lying
on the down line. Two constables started out hot-foot
with an ambulance stretcher. They arrived at the place
indicated. No corpse. They examined every yard of
the permanent way by moonlight. Still no corpse nor
the slightest trace of a tragedy. Then it was resolved
that the unfortunate remains must have been carried off
by the 5.30 p.m. train from Sydney. The driver of that
train was telegraphed to at Hornsby and he made an agi-
tated examination of his engine, but found no trace of
blood or hair. Then it was reluctantly concluded that
deceased must have been drunk, or else merely humorous,
aud had walked away after making his little sensation.
This recalls the case of the corpse that used to be seen
huddled up on the side of the road between Hornsby and
Parramatta. Just opposite where it was wont to squat
was a stump, not more than a foot high but the cause of
many accidents, two, at least, of which were fatal. The
corpse was always there on these occasions. One night a
number of bold spirits lay in wait for it. It did not
appear, but a man, who passed by in a buggy while the
watchers were there, said he saw it on the other side of
the road. He died soon after. That corpse had a beat of
its own, like a policeman, extending from the black ruin
of the convict station to the place where it was hanged.
It was liable to be seen lying around anywhere between
these points. Old residents used to say that that corpse
could not be killed, but it may be dead by this time.

One of the complaints of the Norfolk
Islanders, ventilated during the recent guber-
natorial visit, was the absence of a local fashion
journal and the want of sympathy in that respect
by the Sydney papers, which don’t report the
island “tea and public.” “We have nice enter-
tainments, ”said one patriarch, “but are not able
to keep a chronicle of them.”

Maori tragedies are not frequent. When
they do happen, the best brown girl
is generally at the root of the trouble.
The most notable case of late years was
that of Makaore, an unattractive-look-
ing, bull-necked person,
who was hanged at Napier
for shooting a white named
Gollan, whose house he
afterwards set on fire. He
suspected Gollan of having
gained the affections of a
rather greasy brown girl,
who said that she
wo u Idn’t have
Makaore at any
price, and for
whom, apparent-
ly, Gollan didn’t
care much either.
Latest tragedy at
Rata, in Wanganui
district, was the out-
come of insane jealousy
on the part of Kereopa
Ihaka, who possessed a
rather good-looking wife
—so far as the brown
woman ever is good-
looking. He damaged
her badly with a knife,
and then proceeded to
hack himself with the same
weapon. When it was taken
from him he went full tilt at
a wall, in the hope of dashing
his brains out. His skull
being too thick, he grasped a
tomahawk and whanged him-
self on the cranium with much
vigor until stopped. Then
he died in Wanganui hos-
pital, and the jury found
that Kereopa Ihaka had
committed suicide. It didn’t
say he was out of his mind.
Possibly it was of opinion
that he had never owned much
mind to be out of.

Reported to Sydney City Council the
other day that “fine lolly ” —a stuff that is some-
times sold as “ Turkey lolly”—was in one instance
made at a “factory ” which comprised two rooms.
In the factory lived o.ie white woman, three
colored men, six dogs, three cats, and other
animals whose small size and velocity prevented
accurate calculation of their number. Our
“loyal” and insanitary fellow subject is great on
other animals.
Sundry attempts to stir up the “ English-
men” of Maoriland to celebrate St. George’s Day
ended in miserable and well-deserved failure. At
one well-advertised meeting only two persons,
including a reporter, turned up. Pity Irishmen
and Scotchmen could not also be persuaded to
leave off kicking up antics over a mere myth.

“ Hairy Dayid ” : I’ve noticed of late
that among my friends, the street beggars, the
barrel-organ has been replaced by the
squeaking gramaphone. Originally,
when the ’phone was a novelty, it had
the power of collecting large crowds,
but the novelty now has worn off. My
friend, Blind Johnny, an Adelaide
beggar, t’other day, broke his ’phone,
so brought out his organ, which
he had kept in case of emergency.
It is the only organ about town,
and being something of a
novelty, Johnny has been
doing so well that he
hasn’t troubled to have
his ’phone repaired.
Speaking of that’phone,
I heard a remark passed
one night in reference
to it. A crowd was
listening to it struggling
with “ Ave Maria”
when a couple passed on
t’other side of the road.
She said, “What’s
goin’ on over there?’’
He replied, “ Oh, I
s’pose it’s a woman
takin’ a fit; I can
’ear ’er scream-
in’.”

wished to let

so descanted on
the cost of living and
paying for a musical
education in London. “ But,
of course,” said the aspirant,
“ I need have no fear as to
that. My people will allow
me £5OO a year.” The star
spoke of the influence re-
nnired to cet a heariTiß-.
“But my pa has heaps of
influence,” persisted the young lady; “he’s So-
and-So, and the question of influence needn’t
stand in the way an instant.” “Then,” said the
bored star, “ then you have everything except the
voice.” And the interview closed with a slam.

“Ku-Klux”: I happened into a Mel-
bourne suburban station the other day. Since the
strike the men have been compelled to manage
alone (that is, only one man instead of two on at
a time), according to the deranged ukase of Bent.
It is a fairly busy station. The unfortunate clerk
was selling tickets, train standing at the plat-
form, man waiting to send a telegram, clerk try-
ing to take a telegram by cocking his ear and
repeating the words as they were ticked off. Man
came in to pay for some goods. Arguing the
point with him about rates, clerk gave wrong
change to two people. One (the one who got too
little) came back to swear at him. Another man
came to consign a ton of bonedust. Asked where
he would take it to. Clerk (still trying to sell
tickets, send and receive telegrams," and argue
with the first two men) told him to take it to hell.
Bonedust man wanted to fight. Six more people
wanted tickets. Man with telegram wanted to
fight. Three more people got wrong change.
Finally, clerk seized bell, and, dashing out on
platform, rang it furiously, leaving more people
clamoring for tickets. Then stoker sauntered up
with news that train couldn’t start for half-an-
hour—hot box or something. Then that clerk sat
down and did what the bonedust man and all the
other men had already done—used language.

The little brown men dressed in blue who
have been haunting Sydney of late are an inquiring
crowd and their desire for information is incred-
ible. They go into shops and inspect the shop-
walker, and smile on the girls behind the counter,
and feel the texture of things, and lift things, and
look underneath things, and withal they beam so
gently on everybody that no one cares to throw
them out. They go upstairs and downstairs, and
people on top-floors are surprised to find Japs
coming in to explore and paw and beam.
Whether they carry away muon knowledge is
another question, but they jog inscrutably
back to their ships like men who are loaded down
with information, and when anybody speaks to
them they show 32 teeth in their desire to look
happy and intelligent.

The Burdekin mansion in Macquarie-
street, Sydney, about to undergo a change of
ownership, occupies the site of Sydney’s first
Quaker chapel. The notorious John " Tawell
made a lot of money in a menial capacity in the
wooden hospital nearly opposite, and turning
chemist became one of the wealthy men of the
time. He built the chapel referred to, and
dedicated it to the Quakers. The present was
not appreciated, however, and the building passed
into the hands of the senior Burdekin. After
a time it was demolished, and the present man-
sion erected on the ground. Tawell, in addition
to being a most pious Quaker, led the anti-liquoT
crowd, and is said to have, in a fit of zeal, emptied
COO gallons of rum into the harbor. He was
a swindler most of his life, and on returning to
England was hanged for murdering his mistress.

The Law decided a queer case at Geelong
(Vic.) lately. The matter was one in which a
harmless, necessary Mary Jane sued her ex-
employer for damages for trespass and assault.
It seems the damsel was about to leave her
‘place,’ and the evening before her departure
stayed out till about 10.30. About 1 a.m. her
alleged employer—one of the Sleepy Hollow’s
representative citizens—burst open the door of
her room and commanded her to dress forthwith
and get out into the night. After some demur,
the young woman says, she dressed herself and
decamped, the citizen meanwhilj standing by
viewing the proceedings and urging her to greater
haste in getting inside her corsets and other
haberdashery. That was the girl’s story, and
without hearing the employer’s story, Judge
Gaunt decided there was no ground of action, the
citizen not having committed any trespass in
breaking open his servant’s room door, and there
being no actual assault. As regards the trespass,
therefore, the Victorian law decides that a man
may legally break into the room occupied by any
woman in his house while she is dressing, or in
bed, or having a bath, and may remain there,
provided he doesn’t actually lay hands upon the
occupant. Does the Victorian law exactly know
what it is talking about when it holds that a
woman has no right to keep a man out of her
bedroom, provided that man owns or rents the
house ?

The worship of the Japanese naval visitors
to which a section of the Australian public has
given itself up with a fury of gush during the last
few weeks, means little except that some flighty
people are willing to follow any craze, whether it
is a black cyclist or a yellow sailor, so long as it is
the fashion of the moment. And in a uniform
any sort of man looks very much like other sorts;
put him in a red jacket with some gold braid and
rooster feathers, and a Jap seems as admirable as
a European in the feminine eye—and feminine
eyes are not confined to women. Easily
enough explainable, the Jap craze is none
the less foolish. The women—of both sexes—
who clustered around the Japs would look with
scorn on Chinese; and yet the Chinaman is a
{; nitleman compared with the Jap. He may not
lave the same grimaces of flattery, or the same
cheeky gifts of imitation, but he is infinitely more
honest and honorable. Even in Japan, you will
find the positions of trust mainly held by Chinese;
they don't trust a Jap to hold the money in his
own country. Merchants trading with Asia, too,
will tell that, whilst a Chinaman keeps, good
faith, the Jap merchant is usually a liar and a
rascal. If Australian society folk need to gush
over any Asiatic, they should at least have the
judgment to choose the Chow; but since, by
special legislation, the law keeps all Asiatics out
of the country, all gush should be done by tele-
scope.
THE GREAT PHILANTHROPIST.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
I gathered my gold with the stolen brains
Of men who were slaves. Their bodies and souls
Toiled for me ; I but held the reins ;
And now that the thunder of censure rolls,
I sit with my millions in sumptuous ease,
And bequeath to the nations my libraries.
I rewarded my minions with scanty fare,
And hoarded the gold that their hands had.made.
I doled out bread and pence as their share
Of the money ground from their souls dismayed.
And the sovereigns grew to a mighty pile ;
While mine was a mission to watch and smile.
When millions were mine I paused, and thought
Of the world to come that is mostly gold ;
And I guessed that a front seat might be bought
With a million or two, if all weren’t sold !
And it might turn out an excellent deal,
For there’s plenty of gold up there to steal.
So I cast around for a starting-place
To unload my soul of the weight it bore.
To die with wealth is to die in disgrace—
’Tis strange that I thought not of that before !
You can tread on the toilers and steal and lie,
If you scatter some millions before you die.
So I tip my God, and I bargain with man ;
I say my wealth is a useless thing;
1 boast that I use it as best I can,
That joy to humanity it may bring.
I heed not the starving, the blind and lame--
I spend my gold for applause and fame!
And the wrecks I have made pass daily by,
While men call me blessed and worship my gold;
And I hear not the hungry and hopeless cry
Of those who to me their bodies sold,
But I sit with my millions in sumptuous ease,
And bequeath to the starving my libraries!

Tlio unspeakable Victorian magistracy had
an offender after its own heart before it the other
day—Robert Hill, laborer. To quote the Age
report:
Accused struck her and the child, knocked them down,
and dragged her by the hair into the yard, where he
punched her in the face and made her mouth bleed. lie
dragged the baby from her, and kicked her as she lay on
the ground. The child’s leg was in splints, as it was
suffering from hip disease, and they were torn off.
Attractedbycr.es for help, Mrs. Ralph rushed into the
yard, apd snatched up the infant. Accused then turned
on her like a savage beast, and struck her and the child
several blows. She and Miss Cottril escaped from the
house. He then burst in the door, and again assaulted her.
He subsequently kicked Miss Cottril several times A
fewminutes afterwards defendant’s sister-in-law, Maria
Weber, widow, residing in Lygon-street, rushed to the
house, and found Hill brutally kicking his wife as she
lay on the floor. He took off his coat, rolled up his
sleeves, and, leaping towards Mrs. Weber caught her
by the wrist as she was making her escape through the
front door, saying, “ I’ll do the same to you.” After a
fierce struggle she got away with bruised hands and a
badly strained side. The police then arrived on the
scene and took Mrs. Hill, who was still unconscious, to
the Melbourne Hospital, where she remained for several
days. On the charge of assaulting his wife he was fined
£a, or two months’ imprisonment; and on each of the
other charges he was fined £2, or one month’s imprison-
ment.
This was at the Carlton Court. A Bench which
could punish a vile ruffian like that with a fine
must have a strong practical sympathy with
brutality. The Bulletin would not care to meet
the Carlton bench in a lonely street on a dark
night.

A Maoriland man got an inb.nt on his
hands in quite an original way lately. There
were two perambulators on Linwood, a way-side
railway-station, and two women talking. “To
Blankimoa, ” said one woman, nodding at a pram.
The porter whisked a pram into a van, and just
then the train started. Then there was a shriek.
The wrong pram had been taken—the pram that
was left was empty ; the other one had an infant
buried under a large quantity of wool. A gallant
Maorilander, sizing up the situation, jumped into
the moving van ; and when he had patted the
infant off to sleep he started to think. And he
went on thinking when he lifted the pram out at
the next station and was told that the next train
back wouldn’t be till next day. Then a sad
Maorilander started to wheel a pram and a baby
back to Linwood by road, the infant howling as
he went. He was wearily shoving his burden up
miles of hills and down miles of dales when he
met an excited mother who had been sprinting
after the train.

the company.”
A new principle of law was introduced at
the Adelaide Criminal Sittings, a recent English
case being followed. The “dying depositions ’
of a girl in a hospital were rejected, because they
were not taken down verbatim, question with
answer, so as to show how much of the declara-
tion was voluntary and how much suggested by
the questioner. Also, it was not clear that the
girl was in a “hopeless settled expectation of
death ” (although she died a few days later), so
the depositions were bad every way, and the
prisoner, a “ lady herbalist,” was at once declared
“ Not Guilty.” Her counsel was Rupert Ingleby,
son of the Q.C. of that name who was drowned
with Judge Wearing in the Gothenburg wieck
many years ago, and both Judge Boucaut and the
Crown Solicitor admitted that they had not been
aware of the new point of law successfully raised.
Sydney's Sunday Slimes, which recently
humbly opined that Australia was honored by
the presence of a small brown Sultan, thus opens
a report of the visit of the Japanese :
Less than a couple of years ago we were honored with
a visit from Royalty, and the bonds of Federation were
forged. Now the historian must steep his pen once more
to record the visit of the Japanese fleet, the importance
of which is perhaps not fully realised at this juncture.
The Mary Ann office “historian” then proceeds
to “ steep his pen ” :
By the time the Vice-Regal and other representatives
graced the picturesque park with their presence, the scene
was reminiscent of the occasion of the swearing-in cere-
mony by his Royal Highness the Prince of Wales—then
the Duke of Cornwall and York—of the first Governor-
General and members of the first Commonwealth
Ministry. (/ /!)
It is only two years since the Yorklet was here,
yet the intensely loyal Sunday Grime has already
forgotten (or was apparently too dead to notice
it at the time) that G.-G. Hopetoun and the
Commonwealth Ministry had been sworn in
before the Duke of Cornyork arrived, and that
said person simply opened the Commonwealth
Parliament in Melbourne, whilst his sole perform-
ance in Centennial Park amounted to the fact
that he held a third-rate review there on a rainy
day.
* * * *
Governor-General Tennyson stated, at a
recent Lord Mayoral luncheon, that the present
salary attached to his lofty job is quite sufficient
to maintain two Government Houses and keep
up the dignity of the position—which is rough on
the frail Hopetoun, who left Australia a crushed
wreck, all owing to insufficient pay. For once
Australia cordially agrees with Tennyson. There
are many points of disagreement, but the suffici-
ency of the salary is a matter on which there is
absolute unanimity.

At Bendigo (Vic.), a few days ago, one of
Bent’s blacklegs was sued by a grocery firm for
which had been owing for about 12 months.
It wasn’t alleged that the defend-
ant, who was in regular work
blacklegging for Bent, couldn’t
pay, but Anderson,
J.P., refused to
make any order,
on the ground
that a man who
would sue a black-
leg for the money
justly owing to
him “ wasn’t a
man at all.” The
blackleg, ac-
cording to An-
derson, J. P.,
“deserved
great credit.”
So the grocer,
who had al-
ready given
him great credit
—over twelve
months’ credit
—will apparent-
ly lose his money.
In fact, Ander-
son, J.P., seems
to have presented
the grocer’s money
to the blackleg as
a mark of Ander-
son’s esteem. This
looks all right for
Anderson, but it is
rough on the grocer.

Claimed by Mr.
E. B. Havell, in the
Nineteenth Cen-
tury, that the vic-
torious Englishman,
not cont e nt with
bleeding India white,
has set himself also to
vulgarise the Hindu,
“ who before stood on
a higher artistic plane than
himself.” The typical Indian village arts, such as
pottery, metal-working, and weaving, have been, he
states, ruined by shoddy, aud Indian architecture
has been smothered in the interests of the vulgarly
pretentious and banal English architect. Australia
has been so accustomed to take the Downing-st.
view of the “magnificent work of civilisation”
being done by Britain in India that it is dis-
quieting to find an eminent authority (Mr.
Havell is director of the Calcutta School of Art)
holding that “the Empiie” there is associated
with what Spencer calls re-barbarisation.

If the N.S. W. Government hangs Digby
Grand and Jones—as it says it means to do—the
executions will make the first departure for many
years from the excellent rule of not enforcing
the capital penalty when the jury recom-
mends to mercy. In view, too, of the various
incidents surrounding the trial—the dis-
charging of one jury to allow of the informer
for the Crown having his memory refreshed ; the
cheap and absurdly inadequate provision for the
accused’s legal defence; and the hint of the Full
Court that an appeal on points not taken by the
cheap defence might possibly have succeeded—tl e
See Government had better, in the interests c f
the community, refrain from sending the two men
to the gallows. Perpetual imprisonment will be
just as adequate a safeguard to the public.

“'Vul ” contributes a slanderous item :
The review given in honor of the visiting Jap warships
turned out about the most humorous circus Sydney has
been treated to for some time. Original intention was.
for State Commander Finn to act as master of circuses,
but, at the last moment, the supreme Hutton took
charge. First bungle happened with the landing of the
brown visitor. He had been instructed to land at Rush-
cutters’ Bay, and guides and mounted police were await-
ing him there to conduct him to the ground. But the
Jap landed unexpectedly at Farm Cove, and by the
time a small boy and a dog had rushed off to notify the
authorities of the fact, and the authorities had dispatched
the police and the guides to the spot in a violent hurry,
the said authorities had become quite hot and confused.
When the procesh got under way at last, it was
suddenly discovered, with mirth, that the visitor
wasn’t putting implicit faith in his hosts. Notwith-
standing that a British officer led the way and
mounted police were in attendance, Sydney was
treated to the spectacle of two small Jap officers
walking in advance of the contingent, studying now a
large map of the city, then the route they were following,
in an undisguised determination not to be led into
ambush. The Jap Admiral had evidently heard about
the Push. When the force reached Centennial Park, the
authorities were scandalised to find that the visitors had
come fully armed and evidently prepared to die hard.
After inspection by the Governor-General and other
personages, the combined forces on show began to per-
form. Half-a-dozen bosses were giving different direc-
tions. When the general advance was about to begin,
the British Tars and their Jap brothers got the order in
advance of the rest, and at once began to move. After
they had gone a bit, however, they discovered that they
were alone, so they made a violent effort to reach the
line again, but had hardly right-about-faced when the
rest of the troops began to advance, and the two sections
straightway fell into each other’s arms like long-lost
brothers. The height of the farce was reached at the
conclusion, when the O.C. called for cheers for his Jap
Majesty, and, when these had been given with doffed
helmets, completely forgot to call for a similar yell for
our own lawful King. What the consequences of this
disloyal oversight will be, Heaven only knows.

Bent daily tells the folk who sign them-
selves “Patriot,” “Loyalist,” “Father of Thirty,”
etc., after their indignant letters demanding the
promised refund on tickets chat could not be used
during the strike, that he is sorry he can’t keep
his promise to repay. Many of the hoodlums who
cheered the stout bully during the trouble are
now heaping curses on his head. When the
average “ Loyalist ” loses 2s. 6d. in cne fell heap
his loyalty snuffs out.

Brisbane just; now is a soft snap for
Burglar Bill and Co. The principal reasons are
the ineptitude of those in command and the short
manning of the police force. In one densely
populated suburb containing many bad characters
one constable was left to protect an area of over a
square mile and thirty miles of streets on a recent
Saturday night. Years back an expensive Royal
Commission proposed many drastic alterations,
but the report was ignored, and the old policy x>f
let it slide still continues. In fact, it slides now
more cheerfully than ever.

Young Johnny’s left at last the school—
For joy he cuts a caper ;
He struts, a brainless, lettered fool
Who’s learnt to read a paper.
His creed is yet a trifle crude,
His manners show the Vandal;
But see—his mind is seeking food
Amid the printed scandal.
He browses now on sweet divorce,
And wonders at the Lady ;
He follows now the Ring, the Course,
And all the gossip shady.
He takes a page of murder fell,
And just a pinch of arson ;
Pursues the tale of Daisy Bell
Who drugged and robbed a parson.
And so he reads till all his soul
Is dim with murky vapor ;
For Art and School have won the goal—
He’s learnt to read a paper !

A WOMAN’S LETTER.
Sydney, Juno 16,1903.
Mt Dear Arini,—
Just as we were learning to translate such
exercises as: “Have you the mat which the
Shogun gave to the proprietor of the tea-house,
for Plum-Blossom, the Geisha?” the Japs bade
us “Sayonara!” and the three Jap warships
shook the spray of our harbor off their rams and
swam northward. Sydney society is very sorry,
for the Japs were amusing, and were the cause
of a great outburst of entertainments : but their
departure relieves the two Vice regal staffs of a
regular old man of the sea. The showiest vice-
regal Chrysanthemuming of the past week was the
Tennysons’ “At Home,” at Federal Government
House. It was not numerous, only a few hundred
persons inclusive of the guests of honor, but it was
very fine as to quality—of the uniforms. Most of
them might have been bought straight out at the
Mint without preliminary assay.
As the function was so very official there was not
much youth mixed with the beauty. Exceptions
were the Cranbrook girl and a debutante, Mattea,
eldest daughter of Surgeon-Major Roth, the 7ft.
high, or so, swordsman. Debutante Roth, a tall
damsel, in fine white robe and white violets,
looked so very decorative in a chaste Corinthian
fashion that one didn’t object to the mirrors quad-
ruplicating her. Another exception was Senator
Neild’s perky, bird-like, little daughter. She
has been the idol of the junior Jap officers,
and was always surrounded by a crowd of the
inscrutable, alligator-eyed ones, who didn’t
understand most of her twitterings.
Lady Tennyson—l wish she would lessen the
intellectual aspect of her forehead with a few pin-
curls—had got herself into an epic gown of cream,
with scrolls of cobwebby black lace occurring at
frequent intervals all over it. Mrs. B. R. Wise,
who can make epigrams, but cannot do her hair
over a roll-top wire fence, had what looked like a
sleeveless redingote of point lace over a black
gown, and an extensive Watteau blue bow with
ends that trailed on the Vice-regal carpet. Mrs.
Fitzwilliam Curtis wore a white and pinky some-
thing that suggested apple and peach blossoms,
with a sash of wide velvet ribbon of an exquisite
shade of blue, tied donkeys’-bridge fashion at the
back.
The arrival of Monsignor Count Vay de Vaya,
at Federal Government House, as the Tennyson’s
guest, rather put the Japs in the background.
The count-priest, who is Apostolic Prothonotary,
whatever that may be, is a Hungarian nobleman,
and represented Francis Joseph at the late Vic-
toria's Diamond Jubilee. He is in staggeringly
high society in the old world, and has been a
guest at the Imperial humpies in Russia and
China. At the recent Vice-regal-Mayoral func-
tions Monsignor, in his violet robes, faced with
scarlet, had the effect of something new under
our sun. He is slender, of medium height, and
40 years of age, but, even in the noonday light,
looks 25. A thin, fresh-colored, grey-eyed, long-
nosed face, a modest, smiling manner, and a
much-decorated front are his. Amongst his
decorations is a gold medal, stamped with Franz
Josef’s side-whiskered profile ; a large cross with
large brilliants (might be topaz or chrysoprase)
hangs from his neck, and, as he talks (capital
English), lie constantly twirls a huge jewelled
ring on the finger that with a woman is the
engagement one. I didn’t notice how he parts
his hair, but his shoes are buckled patent leathers;
and he is probably the only high ecclesiastic who
ever visited us without a collection plate concealed
about his person.
Federal Premier’s wife and some military dames
escorted the Count into the moonlit night to
view from the lawn the illuminated warships, Jap
and British, set in the dark dream-like sea. If
the picture didn’t impress him our climate must.
Women strolling about at an hour before mid-
night in winter, moonrays and starshine on bare
shoulders and deltoid muscles. There are com-
pensations for absence from the Vatican, and
there are Australian nights as good as the Floren-
tine ones immortalised by Heine.
The Japs’good-bye took the farm of an “At
Home” on board their flagship, which was deco-
rated by sailor-made chrysanthemums, cherry-
blossoms and wisteria in rice-paper. The patient,
hard-working Rawsons were again on deck, look-
ing at what the Japs said was the biggest gun in
Australian waters, and watching the juggler pro-
duce eggs—dozens of them—from the hem of a
handkerchief (a griat gift, this, when eggs are 3s.
per dozen) and a laughing jackass out of a hat.
A little widow is a dangerous thing. No man
should be allowed to marry a widow, let alone a
relict older than himself, without first satisfying
a medical expert that he is free from all G.P.I.
symptoms. I am moved to these reflections by
the news of the murder of the Servian King and
Queen. Poor Natalie, the dead King’s mother,
might be properly described as a queen “pre-
eminent in grief.” Milan, her husband,
was a faithless consort, an arrant rascal, and
a bad ruler. He was the original of the
despicable potentate m Daudet’s “Kings in
Exile,” in which book ex-Queen Natalie and her
son (just murdered) also figure. When Milan
judiciously retired from his kingship, lest worse
things should happen to him, and stipulated for
what he evidently regarded as the safer post of
commander of the army of his son and successor,
boy Alexander took the throne, and the people
were prepared to love him extremely and join
hands all round. But a woman intervened. The
widow Maschin, who was one of Natalie’s ladies
of honor, made large, dark eyes at him. She was
close upon Natalie’s own age. Everyone at
Court saw the “eyes,” so the Queen-mother dis-
missed her. The widow as much as told the
Queen-mother to “ shift herself,” and married the
youthful King, in the face of a storm of opposi-
tion from his councillors, mother, subjects, and
even his fallen frisky father. The union sowed
dragons’ teeth, and the harvest was reaped in
blood last week.
In this sordid age, nobody can retain an illusion
long. It now appears that the diamond-dotted
teeth of the Sultan of Johore are a set worn only
on State occasions. His ordinary week-day teeth
are made of the usual materials. Thousands who
have watched for the opening of the royal mouth,
and been disappointed, will now understand the
wherefore of the mystery. The Sultan and Sul-
tana are staying at the Australia; where the
guests fail to take full meals—being too busy
watching for the Sultan to smile.
The death of Chief Under-Secretary Critchetb
Walker, on Saturday last, of pneumonia, was a
severe shock to old-time Sydney. He had been
suffering some years from diabetes, and whilst
attending the requiem service of the late Mr. J.
Toohey, at St. Mary’s Cathedral, he got a chill
and his death occurred after a week’s illness.
Mr. Walker was unmarried. A sister living at
Randwick (Sydney), and a brother in Queensland,
survive him. He had built a lovely house at Port
Hacking, near the cottages of his great friends,
the Jack Wants and the B. R. Wises, and con-
templated living there, after his retirement, and
having as much of his beloved fishing as he listed.
An ex-Melbourne woman journalist, now living
near London, recently read a paper before the
just-founded Austral Club in that city on (lean
up against something) “Ostrich Farming in the
Colonies As an Occupation for Women.” The
lady evidently thinks that ostrich-rearing is on
all fours with ordinary poultry keeping. A group
of large, violent birds, seven or eight feet high,
chronically on the watch to knock the stuffing
out of their keepers with a kick, do not provide a
suitable occupation for women here—or any-
where else. I hope the reader told the Aus-
tralite (who yearned *o go ostrich breeding) to
carry a forked stick, . a good long one at that,
to jamb against the bird’s neck while plucking his
feathers. If she had no stick and the violent bird -
started to pursue her, her only escape from being
a mangled remains would be to lie down fiat in a
hollow. The bird might dance on her but that
doesn’t quite kill, even though his weight is not like
that of a turkey, or any of the winged creatures
that women usually farm ; and he seldom leaps on
his victim for more than half-an-hour at a stretch,
though he may come baok for a final jump before
he definitely retires.
There will be a heavy mail, letters and parcels,
from Japan to Sydney, after the black warships
get home. That is if the Jap officers keep faith
which the girls to whom they promised to
send tea-sets, rugs, screens, booklets of verse, and
picture post-cards. Two of the brown officers
made their way up to the private house of one of
the Ministry to get his daughter’s autograph in
Bobby Burns birthday books. Most of the dam-
sels who met the little warriors are now exhibit-
ing perpendicular-line writing in tea-caddy char-
acters, opposite certain dates, and poetical
quotations, such as “’Tis better to have loved and
lost than never to have loved at all.”
Cards are out for an American dance to be
given by a group of U.S.A. citizens on July 3rd,
at Paddington Town Hall, to start at (to quote
the cards) “ half after eight.” The Governor-
General will be present, if he and Lady Tenny-
son are in Sydney on the date fixed.
Mrs. Lance Rawson, widow of a Queensland
squatter, was re-married in London recently to
Mr. F. R. Ravenhill.. Mrs. Rawson was known
in Australian journalistic circles and once ran a
Labor paper at Rockhampton, Queensland.
Sir Harry Rawson’s aide, Major Holman (now
don’t sound the 1), had a narrow escape from
death last week when riding in a paper chase got
up for the benefit of the little Tennyson boys.
The party was returning and when on the high
road near Cranbrook the Major’s horse bolted and,
slipping on the asphalt, threw its rider on to the
tram line. Though the brain concussion was not
serious, Major Holman has two severe cuts on the
back of the head.
Some items of the late J. T. Toohey’s will have
gone abroad as follows: —To his widow, £lOOO a
year for her private use and .£3OOO a year for the
up-keep of “Innisfail,” the Toohey house at
Wahroonga on the North Shore line. If the lady
marries she loses the £3OOO a year, but gets an
addition of £4OO a year to her pin money.
Maurice Toohey, the only son, has £6OOO a year
and cannot marry without the consent of
his stepmother and Mr. Sargood (son of the
late senator, one of the executors). If lie
marries against their joint consent, he loses 80 per
cent, of his inheritance. The three Misses
Toohey get <£31,000 each. A very small amount
is bequeathed to charities. And some relatives
by marriage get small legacies.
Writes my Melbourne correspondent:—
“Justice Francis Winter, of Papua, and his
Melbourne bride have been starring at private
functions. They were at the Wattle Club’s
christening the other day, and had to stand as the
target of many eyes. The new Mrs. Winter
wears her dark clothes in a dashing manner. The
grey tinges in the Justice’s beard count for a
selateness and a solemnity not in his manner.
The gentleman is a very bright party, and much
less unbending than the local bencher.
“Mrs. Fred Stephen has set off for India’s
coral strand, where her chum and matrimonial
relative, Mrs. Bingham, reigns (so ’tis said) in a
swagger camp set. She was one of Melbourne
society’s most assured and energetic members,
and gave wonderful help to any charity she
sympathised with. Of late, for some reason or
other—mostly, I guess, the other—she has taken
a place in the Social Reserve corps, and iust
quietly piloted Mrs. Stephen (mother of Chief
Justicess Madden) along.
“The Cliveden widow’s friends, discussing her
daughter’s recent marriage, hark back to the
beginnings of the match. Bridegroom Lindsay,
then a bachelor member of Lord Beauchamp’s
Sydney staff, chanced to come over to Melbourne
‘ Clip ’ with his chief and party. The Beauchamp,
himself, so runs the tale, had in his own domain
been matrimonially hunted, journalistically har-
ried, and popularly discussed till he had lost his
nerve and his trepidation had infected his suite
(like himself, unmarried and unprotected). While
in Melbourne, the shy, skeerybmd was invited to
an extra chic dinner at Cliveden, whose hostess,
as is her wont, made no attempt to monopolise
her eligible guests, but bade to meet them the
Y beauty (more sylphlike than now), the
Z heiress (now married) —in short, all the most
sought-after charmers of the moment. Neverthe-
less, the honors of the evening fell easily to the
pale, pensive daughter of the house.
4 Welcome as a white violet to eyes weary of waratah ’
said the verse-quoting Beauchamp, meaning,
maybe, that shy girls are scarce in Australia.
The head of the band, ’tis understood, did not get
past ‘ lisping his appreciation in numbers,’ unlike
henchman Lindsay, who promptly set about
securing the ‘little southern flower,’now trans-
planted to his own garden.
“ Out back in a sister-State, they were recently
discussing details of a ball to be given in honor of
their State-Governor, touring thereabouts. A
supper-committee of ladies came in to expound
their views to the mere men on the financial
council. ‘Trifle would be nice’ mused a com-
mittee member, ‘but perhaps it’s too expensive.’
‘Tripe! Why tripe’s cheap enough!’ responded
a councillor, formerly engaged in meaty pursuits.
He was a hearty soul, and laughed louder than
anyone when they explained that ‘trifle’ was a
synonym for his old friend ‘ tipsy cake,’ but at the
end of his guffaw he remarked that ‘ considering
that His Excellency’s inside, like his own (the
speaker’s), was not so young as it used to be, he
shouldn’t wonder if midnight tripe wouldn’t sit
under the vice-regal waistcoat a jolly sight easier
than t’other stuff.’
“Carrie Haase, Mdme. Kellermann, and
Napoleon Boffard, plus Herr Kahn, gave a
pleasant little entertainment in Glen’s Hall,
t’other night. Miss Haase, who is the daughter
of a Melbourne printer, is a young elocutionist,
gifted with a fine voice, and deserving credit for
the fact that she recites stuff worth hearing on its
own merits. She has a bright, intelligent, attrac-
tive face, and looked well t’other evening in flow-
ing white and wreath of white roses in her hair.
On the other hand, the Haase stage “ actions,” so
far, are not free or graceful. Her first recital was
given up to the ‘Light of Asia.’ Next is a
‘ Tennyson Evening,’ while the last will deal with
Shakspeare, Stephen Phillips, and Schiller’s
‘Joan of Arc.’ Mdme. Kellermann showed fine
pace as a pianist, chasing airs through lightning
variations and catching them every time. Kahn’s
violin treatment of‘Gipsy Dances’ was spirited,
and Boffard contributed six songs in parcels of
three. Worst of song-groups is that the senti-
ment of one song can’t sink in, if hearers are
whisked without break to the vocal expression of
some other, perhaps diverse, emotion.
“That new sect which broke out near Bendigo
under the guidance of a long-haired American
gentleman named Jeffries, and had a revelation
to the effect that it was to leave off work, is
already in trouble The wife of the principal
local believer—presumably the one who left off
work hardest —has already appeared at the court
to find out the current quotation for a summons
for desertion. Whether the male convert has
departed on a white donkey for Jerusalem, or
how he has left, hasn’t transpired, but new sects
which leave off work seem to have no luck some-
how.
“ One of those who were victimised by a
notorious picture-dealer in Europe was Mrs. Ellis
Rowan, who had several hundreds of pounds’
worth of pictures brushed out of her income.
New York has been setting up her petite frame
by a series of new hygienics, which are supposed
to have scraped 20 years off her age.
“Amateur performers seem to think the
Excellencies and Waxellencies were sent into this
world to be offered up to them as a frozen sacrifice
in draughty halls. Incidentally, the Exes, and
Waxes, may be permitted to dabble in political
ceremonials and so forth, but their highest privi-
lege is to draw the gilt-edged frivollers (or some
of them) to amateur theatrical shows. But when
the State Clarkes and the stately Maddens turned
up unanimously to watch ‘ The "Prude’s Progress ’
at Prahran Town Hall, only a few people followed
the vice-regal lead, and the public came not at
all. Jerome’s comedy might have been better
amateured; but perhaps the small audience was
responsible.
“The playfulness of a set of ‘superior’ she-
mummers in a Melbourne hostelry is a never-
ending source of wonder and delight to other
sojourners. They skip and chase the leisure
hours with the inconsequent airs of children.
How artless!
“A woman doctor has voiced her alarm to
several patients, of the untold injury being
inflicted on the commissariat department of the
feminine frame by the steel girders and the
whaleboned clips employed in the corsets of the
hour. The compression of the waist in former
years is said to have been a mere mole hill to the
mountain of danger in the present lashing-in of
the pantry parts.
“The Western 3quattocracy is gradually getting
off to spend the results of recent wool clips
abroad. Half the Colac homesteads are left to
the moth and the rust, and the other things that
consume, while their owners gad on the Con-
tinent. The latest to weigh anchor are Mr. and
Mrs. Tom Fairbairn. The Christian Scientists
lose a strong supporter in Mrs. Tom, who sent all
Toorak wondering when she shook off her old
beliefs and her frivolities to embrace the new
faith. Mrs. Tom taught her chums to dispense
with the formula, ‘ How are you ? ’ Being a
staunch and ever-mindful scientist, she declared
she could never be anything but well, and was
insulted by the casual inquiry.
“ A visit the Hambourgs paid to the Loretto
Convent, Ballarat, has been much spoken of. It
appears that the musical brothers were fellow-
passengers with the Rev. Mother-General, head of
the Irish Order, and a distinguished Loretto sister
who is a great harpist, coming out on a visit to
Ballarat. Aboard ship, Boris was so distressed for
an accompanist that at last theR.M.-G. gave per-
mission for the sister to supply the piano
parts, and then the two Hambourgs’ manes shook
out their raptures at the sister’s skill. Hence the
call at the Convent.
“It is a wise Melbourne woman who knows
how to dress herself for Flemington. The other
Monday, the majority had ventured in silken
apparel under the clear sunshine and an assuring
sky. For an hour, the Terrace tiles glinted in the
goldness of things, and skirts were set a-trail.
Then came clouds, and finally heavy sheets of
rain. The Terrace was cleared as if by magic.
“ A few rows of smart flutterers at the holiday
Monday Concert in the Exhibition sat as proof
that Napoleon Boffard has the ear of some
of the Society set to which he has tootled so
long and so tenderly. Toorak, as a rule, does not
turn out to the ‘popular’ concert, so M. Boffard
may pat his chest y pillow a little harder than
usual, and say “Nap, my boy, ze ladies lofe
you.’’ His face, that night, glowed like a large
prize Jonathan apple, and his millinery effects
dazzled the audience to the faint dim back
rows of its odd thousands. Presently the moire
coat-flaps face a benefit house, and the stout
bosom of the Tenor will unburden its sweet song
for the last time, so they say, under a Melbourne
roof.
“ From the Friday inauguration by Premier
Barton it would seem the Wattle Club is going
to flourish like the green bay tree, but things are
not always what they seemed at first. Over two
hundred social souls are enrolled and eager to eat,
talk, read, write, 101 l or sleep there. The counter-
pane in the best bedroom is a temptation to most
women of a cream complexion to rest thereabouts.
The men visitors on Friday had a glimpse of the
boudoirs and other rooms and marvelled at their
luxuriousness. Up in the club’s tea-room certain
of the newly-blessed members talked with the
Fed. Ministers, while the mass of the gathering
crushed for its comforts in the larger hall below
stairs. Mrs. Drake, Mrs. Irvine, and Mrs. Isaacs
had their particular parties. It’s a big and ex-
pensive venture.
“The chemise comes into blushful prominence
in Madame Sans-Gene. But the blue silk and
lace amalgamation worn by Sans-Gene in the
Court apartment, and referred to as “chemise
and petticoat” is a pardonably pretty dishabille.
Only a few frail Mb 6 ribbon threads hold the spare
article to the shoulders, but in spite of extra-
ordinary wrigglings and dancing capers it remains
secure, and nothing happens.
“ A drab audience, mostly frozen about its open
strip of chest and funnybone, left all the bril-
liance of the ‘ Sans Gene ’ house to come from the
far side of the footlights. There the duchesse of
the title role glows, mostly with a sober back-
ground of court suits or brown swinging-doors, in
a summery silk, over which posies of pink play a
kind of ring-a-ring-a-rosy up to a margin of moss-
green velvet and an edge of ermine. The per-
fection of this garb, and the artistic get-up
generally, strike a note quite out of harmony with
the barbarities of the ‘ Sans Gene ’ tongue.
“There was a carriage load or two of smart
women at the Oaklands gathering on Saturday.
One style obtained—the scutty skirt, the martial
coat, and the cross-bred toque of Summer hue and
cold season stuff. Good arrangements now help
to make Moonee Valley a draw. There is, among
the marquees, a toilet tent, and there blue noses
may be powdered with impunity, and the hat that
went askew on the long way out may be jerked to
its legitimate angle. Anyone who suspects Mel-
bourne flutterers of assuming the tired feeling
should see them do a sprint to the tea tent at any
of these free afternoon race feeds, and once there
fight for their fourth and fifth dishes of tea.

HEAVY COLDS.
Heavy colds strain the lungs—weaken the chest—disturb
sleep—banish appetite—cause melancholy.
Pale, weak people, whose hands and feet are chill for
want of rich, red blood, always catch cold. Their lungs are soft
and moist—the heart can’t send out blood enough to make them
sound and strong.
Then comes the cold and cough—racking the poor frail frame—tearing the tender The cold

which Mitchel wrote. Then he gave

Vic. Lands Minister Taver-
ner, who was a coach-driver
in his pre-Parliamentary
days, carries traces of
his old employment
in an extraordinary
shrug of the shoulders
whenever he is con-
versing or delivering
one of his jerky speeches.
This habit, generally
thought to be due to some
nerve trouble, springs from
the coach-driver’s method of
“shooing” off aggressive bush
flies when they settle on his neck
and face and his hands are engaged
with the reins. Thus Taverner is
always “shooing” away an imaginary fly,
and the fly’s name, presumably, is
Prendergast.

When Bully Bent comes out of Cabinet

Mary Scholastica (Jane Frances Therry),
who lately died in the Benedictine convent,
Subiaco, aged 69 years, was a native of Sydney,
daughter of Roger Therry, a long ago Judge of
u P£f me Court, who retired from the Bench in
1859. The Judge published a volume of reminis-
cences, which smote some of the first families so
hard that he was asked to recall the work, and
did so as far as he was able. There are still, how-
ever, copies to be purchased at a price. Therry
came to N.S.W. with letters of introduction from
Daniel O’Connell. In 1841 he became Attorney
General, was Resident Judge at Port Phillip in
1845, and in 1846 returned to Sydney as a Judge
of the Supreme Court and primary Judge in
Equity. He died in England in 1874.

Ihes s ®l°ction of J. S. Cargill, a popular
officer of N.S.W. Crown Law Department, to be
solicitor to the Railway Commissioners at £lOOO a
year, was partly owing to the appointee’s merits.
Also it was partly owing to the indecent clamor

the job so violently, and raised so much dust, and
bunted up so much political influence, that the
easiest way out was to appoint a man with no
political influence, and one who raised no dust.

I was present at a tooth extraction by a qualified
chemist. It was in a Victorian has-been gold-mining
town that died in the sixties, and the chemist and his
stock in trade had been there eversince. The patient, a
young woman, sat on the floor, her back to a wall. A
neighbor held her head. The ancient brought his relic
of the Inquisition, in the form of a corkscrew, working
through a thimhle-like cap. On the end of the corkscrew
were a pair of jaws on a swivel to clutch the tooth ; the
cap fitted on the gums. The operator got to work ; then
there was a sharp crack (the jaw-bone) and the tooth
came out, hut the patient could not close her jaws for
four weeks. Saw an old identity extract his own tooth
once. He tied the offending molar short up to an open
door, fastened a yellow handkerchief to the handle to rouse
h's fury, let out a Fenian yell, and kicked the door. He
nev_>r f It it.
“ Scotty W.” : Be affection of one animal
for another. Take the case of the celebrated man-
killing stallion, Cruiser, which was so strongly
attached to a cat. Again, Bob Smith, rabbiter,
and S. Melb. ratter, had a slut that used to camp
with the sow that had suckled her at Brookong
(1891).

“L.L.” : Near here (Mittagong, N.S.W.) is
a white gum from which, about 20 feet up, project
two branches, which, after growing divergently
for a few feet, rejoin , and continue as one branch.
I think the case is unique.

Will Jarratt gives a gloomy (and to some
extent true) picture of the “ typical cocky ” '•
No idea of personal comfort, no thought for the con-
venience of others. When he goes on the land he dumps
his family on the nearest sand ridge, and begins to clear.
Acres, horses, seed-wheat, implements; but no work for
something commodious to eat, sleep, .and spend Sun-
day in. A dozen, counting cocky, cockyess, and offspring
often live in one stuffy, unsightly apartment. The food
isn’t the thing it could be if the woman were not required
out-of-doors. For there are thousands of wrinkles for
making a poor dish at least tasty if the house-wife is
given the time to cook. Dogs and cats and tattered hens
of no particular breed hang about with a furtive eye to
business. While it isn’t raining the domestic supply of
water is in a remote reservoir—always remote. What’s
wanted isn’t another horse, or another acre ; but 79, or
even 97 sheets of bark, and enough sun-dried bricks for
3chimnevs. Then time, alacrity, expertness, and nogrum-
bling. The same slovenly, slip-shod methods that account
for the up-ended condition of his domestic felicity cause an
appalling loss of time in the cocky’s paddock. Wrenches,
grease-pots, and tug-chains are incessantly in demand —
when in hiding. No decent place for the cocky to doss ;
no peg for Poll’s winkers. Plenty of sharp, aggressive
points to stake a horse, or dislocate an eye ; but it takes
four hours and a pitchfork to rescue a trace from the
dung-heap. If Dad hurriedly wants a shovel, one —
casually—is in the 40-acres, the other up a box-tree,
where Ponto got the ’possum. Binders, winnowers and
the like are left to split, curl, and accumulate rust where
last used. Everything put down promiscuously. His
fences also indicate what a careless, inadequate person
the cocky is. Waifs, weeds, and truants intrude without
even stepping over a rail, and debauch undisturbed till
the best part of a promising barley-patch is pillaged and
underfoot. Cocky dreads to effect repairs—can’t afford
the time--and trespassing flocks and herds drift in and
relieve him of jealously-numbered stooks. The futile
Smith’s belongings cross into the imbecile Brown’s oats,
and the latter’s poddy calves return the visit next day,
munching pensively as they go. He is too fond of multi-
plying his wheat area, adding to his string of weeds, and
neglecting to provide for the incidental downpour. Stock
at all hazards ; wheat whether or no ; water left to Pro-
vidence and Parliament 1

“ Wilgar ” : There are white men, but I
have met {hem mostly of another color. An
instance : Helped
with his chaff-cut-
ting one whose thin-
faced State-orphan
kiddy was absolutely
the most ill-used in-
fant I’ve encoun-
tered. That day,
when driving the
horses, the tail of the
cocky’s left-off coat
which the kiddy was
wearing got caught
in the clutch, and in
a moment he was
thrown down. Ran
out to find his arm
broken in two places.
Boss wanted to finish
cutting, but, as I
wouldn’t hear of it,
the poor child was
grudgingly driven
four miles, in a dray,
to the doctor’s, arriv-
ing there drenched to
the skin. As a result,
influenza set in, necessitating both doctor and
apothecary, which riled the boss considerably.
Last time I saw the patient, he was minding
sheep on a sloppy road, his arm in splints, and
doing his own barking—he had no dog.

“ Bobrid ” : Curious that, while no matter
how hard you ram the earth into the entrance of
a rabbit burrow bunny can whip it out in a jiffy—
you have only to plug the hole with a bran-bag or
even a newspaper, and the tenant is “ broke up ”
in one act and looks out for another lodging.
* * * *
“Bob R.”: Despiteall the fuss about foxes,
where rabbits are plentiful they will never touch
a lamb, much less a grown sheep. The writer is
on a station where foxes are numerous and the
lambs in thousands, yet he has not known of an
authenticated case of lamb-killing by a fox. When
a lamb is found dead with its tongue eaten out the
fox is always blamed, but I believe that in most
of these cases the common crow is the criminal.

N.S.W. Aborigines Advocate telling of
how Christian civilisation has lifted up the
blacks: —
The aboriginal race was once strictly moral. The
penalty in some tribes for adultery was death, sometimes
by burning, but now they are demoralised. We have
taken from them, or laughed them out of, their old laws
and ceremonies and given them nothing but vices in
return, consequently their last state is worse than the
first.

“J.A.F.”: Be goat-meat. I was, some
years ago, at a cookie’s place where a parson was
doing a wholesale christening. The old cocky
proudly ushered the “ meenister ” and myself into
the sitting-room for dinner, the dish being goat’s
head, au naturel —horns, teeth, eyes, and all. The
skin only had been taken off, and most likely a
good tuft of beard, too ! We passed.

“Gumleaf” on a phase of “local in-
dustry ”:
Saw two queer “ bottle-o ” sights in a Melbourne suburb
t’other day. A very fat man sat slumbering in a ram-
shackle cart, while his scraggy horse leaned his head
against the kerbstone to keep himself steady. Two little
children, ragged and barefooted, aged about 6 and 7
years, dodged in and out of the backyards, piping
“ Bottle-o ! ” and calling bo each other to know whether
“ yer wukked Mrs. ’Arris or Mrs. Jones.” The kids were
evidently devilling for their sleek, sleeping father in the
cart. Round the pext corner a wild-eyed, hairy man
jogged along, harnessed between the shafts of a heavy
hand-cart. The man was happy and contented. He had
a child’s toy whip, which he kept on cracking, and
shouting out sternly, ,f Get hup ’osses.” The cart was
piled up with bottles, and the man was tossed about
between the shafts as the load rattled over the rough
stones. Inquiries showed that the man with the hand-
cart heavily loaded was a simple lunatic, who fancied he
was driving horses the moment a whip was put into his
hands. A shrewd individual had got hold of him, and
found the illusion was even stronger if the man was
attached to a hand-cart. Hence he used him as a moke
to cart around his bottles. The illusion was so strong
with the lunatic that he would not rest a moment, and
when the journey was not straight ahead he would trot
the imaginary horses up and down the street, like the
coachman of “ me lord’s carriage,” so that the animals
might not get stiff.

“B. Belle ” : Molasses again. At a sugar
mill, the other day, some Kanakas (who were
afflicted with a skin disease) were sent into some
molasses tanks to clean same out. Three days
later skin disease disappeared. Don’t know any-
thing further about the molasses.

“T.R.N.” : A Balmain (Sydney) resident
was recently much mystified by repeated disap-
pearances of chickens, but was enlightened on
discovering a horse, kept in the yard with the
fowls, engaged in “scoffing” the last of a clutch
of eight—feathers and all. Fact.
“Yarrum ” :
Quite a number of
people nowadays
steel rings as a cure
for rheumatism. One
acquaintance of mine
who wears the bit of
metal got some ter-
rible twinges t’other
day, and in the even-
ing said to his wife,
“Mary, this con-
founded ring is no
good ; I’ve had the
old pains on me to-
day as bad as ever.”
Then Mary’s gaze
wandered o’er his
hairy hand, and the
ring was discovered
missing. He’d taken
it off in the morning
to chop wood, and
had forgotten to re-
place it. An old
South Coast publican
knocks off serving
every now and again
to scrape his ring on

tricity is a wonderful

When Clermont was booming, the publicans raked
in the shekels hand-over-fist. One favorite Bung
never took less than £3O a night for drinks—
sometimes more. After 12 months or so of this
he visited Sydney. While he was there he looked
over a German warship then in harbour and spent
£7OO in shouting champagne for all hands on
board. The man is now composing music for a
bare living. Fact.

How Monday “ fell in ” ;
“ Monday " was our fighting champion. He was a naif-
caste who had been on the station for years, and had
been taught to box. One afternoon a hawker arrived at
the homestead ; and, after tea, began business, but lie
had hardly opened his boxes before he had a dispute
with Monday, and the fight was soon arranged. The
moonlight was but faint, and some trees made it still
gloomier, so that the men could only just about see one
another. Monday crept forward, bending and crouchii.g.
The hawker gave one or two light, springy hops, and the
next thing we heard was a tremendous thud, and
Monday was lying on his back. The steam was knocked
completely out of him. “My word,” he spluttered,
“him fight diff’rent way altogether. No more fight
Monday.” Next morning I helped the hawker in with
his horses. The fight was still puzzling me. “ I’m
blowed if I could see how you did it, mate,” I remarked.
“ All I could see was a whirl of arms an’ legs.” “Yes,”
he replied, with a wink, “ a couple of years of acrobating
in a circus is a good training for that game. Teaches you
to turn somersaults, you know, and to get home with
your feet as well as your hands.” Then the whole business
was as clear as daylight.

“THE ONE THING NEEDFUL.”
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
By the flukes of Jonah’s whale, by the spikes on Satan’s
tail,
By the hinges on the Seven Gates of Hell,
I am sick and tired of wearing out my soul in useless
swearing,
For I’ve realised that cursing is a sell.
Yes, the dull old plain profanity is weariness and vanity
I want One Word, the sound of which shall be
A trumpet and a sword, not a useless tinsel gaud,
But an adequate, complete epitome.
A word that will combine all the swears for which I
pine ;
One crashing curse that thunders like the sea;
All the wrongs a man may feel metamorphosed into
steel.
And welded into one great blasphemy.
In itself it should unite all the venom and the spite
Of every curse th it e’er was uttered j et;
And should concentrate in one all the oaths beneath the
sun,
Since face to face with Fate strong men have met.
Then a man could rend his fetters with the magic of the
letters
That composed that splendid star of observation—
All the sulphurous universe of anathema and curse
Would circle round that sunlike objurgation.
I am deadly tired of “Blast!” and the charms of
“ Damn ! ! ” are past;
Such futile words no longer move my soul;
And the joys of life have faded, and my weary brain is
jaded,
And I yearn for that One Word which is The Whole.
PONEMAH.

Alba : I was told that he lived about
midway between Glen Innes and Inverell, and
t n Cal^ y> 1 left the coa “ l ‘ th 4 half-
way pub., followed a track along the ridge until
I sighted smoke rising above the pines, and pre-
sently came upon a tent with a kind of gunvah
parlor at the back. He was sitting cross legged
W 3 ™ a ? e3Smg P aper , a to subscribers.
He eyed me suspiciously, but when I pulled out
tobacco he invited me inside. The tent was
simply packed with old Bulletins. He slept on
Bulletins, and his table and bed were supported
on Bulletins. After some talk, he told me in a
cautious whisper that he was Turramutta Bill
editor and sole proprietor of The Bulletin’
(How he has hitherto escaped the “ Aboriginali-
ties columni, by the way, is a mystery.) His
printing machine is a marvel of cranky ingenuity
At first, writer mistook it for a butcher’s
gallows, but investigation showed that the
cross-beam was a mass of wooden type-about
a column of • set-up” aboriginal words A
groove in the side of the gallows allowed
the beam-like press to come down upon a flat
slab of cedar supported by a dozen kerosene-tins
f, o l . qi i I H, d v Casua l ly after tl,e health of the staff.
Staff he said “ Why, Hop’s just gone down
th ( gully to git a bear. 'He gits lots o’ bears, an’
he s all right with a boonferang; but, between you
an in©, be can t bile a billy. Look at his drorin 99
—and he pointed out various charcoal smudges on
the face of the cedar slab. While waiting for Hop
to come along with the bear, I discovered that the
crank s tent was the meeting-place of the literary
bullocky and the poetic swagman ; indeed I soon
found that an untorn Bulletin may be readily
swapped for tobacco, bread, damper, tea, or
sugar, and that editor Turramutta Bill had sense
enough to know the value of his back-numbers.
On the way back I met “ Hop,” who proved to be
an aboriginal with a fine literary manner, but with
a somewhat too pressing desire for rum or beer.
He carried a sugar-bag, but no bear. That night,
while dining at the pub., I was startled by a
terrific din in the direction of Bill’s camp, as
though half-a-dozen elephants were caracoling in
a wilderness of loose milk-cans. The publican
however, reassured me with the information that
it was only Turramutta Bill “going to press.”

“ Taparura ” to The Bulletin :

The missionaries

sequently the o.w.m.
to a mission-boy is

would do these nar-
row-minded mission-
aries a world of
good if they would
travel incog amongst
other natives than
theirimmediate own,
who have been mis-
sionised for a month
or two. They would
see how the natives
would steal from
them and treat them
(as non-missionary
whites) with the con-
tempt that is b rn
of mission-teaching.

“ Percol ” ! Some years ago a “ religious
Chautauqua” was instituted in Victoria, and held
its first two annual meetings in the Grampians.
The thihg, however, soon fell through, and now
the only trace of the movement is at a very pretty
water-spot where a little creek flutters down a
rugged precipice. On the most prominent rock
is painted, in huge, staring capitals : “ Whosoever
drinketh of these waters shall thirst again, but he
that drinketh of the Waters of Life shall never
thirst.” The whole picturesque effect of this
beautiful spot is spoilt; but then, to disfigure the
handiwork of God appears to be part of the reli-
gion of to-day.

thus materially assisting the “ firm’s ” progress.

A Vic. agricultural expert was lately
lecturing in the country, and was met at an. out-
efAcc-way place at early morn by a young fellow
who had to drive him some distance. They first
went to the local pub for refreshment. Asked
what he would have, Bushy bashfully remarked
that he would take the same as the expert, who
called for sherry and bitters. He oarefully
watohed his host sprinkle the bitters in his glass,
empty the stuff out, and fill up with sherry ; but
unfortunately reversed the process himself. “My
blanky oath,” he exclaimed after he had gulped
down a glassful of angostura, “ yous foreign
blokes do drink some funny stuff; but I s’pose
you get pretty used to it.”
Tho street preacher was enlarging on the
iniquity of excluding the harmless necessary
oigger. “Will the black man be shut out of

No ! black or white, yellow or dusky, they all

listening said, “They’ll have to die first,” and
said nothing more.
A picture of female life in Freetrade
England (from the Daily Mail)
Not only do women forge chains in Cradley Heath, but
they also make bricks. Any man who has ever done
laboring work will know that brick-making is in some
respects harder work than navvying. There is the inces-
sant, monotonous stooping and lifting.
It was pitiful to watch these women. In fact, to tel]
the truth, the poor things did not look like women at all.
The heavy labor had taken the woman-shape from their
bodies. The softness of the sex had gone from them.
They worked in silence. They did not sing as the
women sang when they were forging the chains. And
their faces looked different from the faces of the women
workers in iron. The chain women had not the look of
masculinity that these women had. The work at* the
forge was more interesting and, of the two, less hurtful
to them as women.
As one saw them laying the bricks in silence in the
monotonous rows, one thought of the heavy pall of smoke
that lay over Cradley Heath—the pall seen from the
distance. One thought of the feeling that came to the
mind of there being something sinister behind the thick,
heavy, distant cloud. And surely there was something
sinister. It was here before the eyes—here in this town
of the leaden light.

About an Adelaide identity :
One long streak of humanity, Percy \V. Berry, book-
seller, and son of Rev. Joe Berry, of Adelaide, has
inherited all the eccentric nature of his dad. He it was
who ostentatiously refused to put on sale Paris Nesbit’s
now defunct Morning, on the grounds of its blasphemy.
Also, when the S.A. Early Closing Act came into forcej
at the end of 1900, he was the man who sent round copies
of this memorial card to his customers: “On the Ist
January, 1901, suddenly, at “Pennsylvania,” Allen’s
Corner, Kent Town, from acute early-closing disease
induced by an unreasonable Act of Parliament, after d
o’clock, the valued trade of the proprietor, aged 4 years
Deeply to be regretted.” In his shop window he pasted :
“ This establishment will be closed every evening at t!
o’clock, and on Wednesdays at 1 o’clock, until Parliament
learns to mind its own business and permits me to mind
mine,” or something very similar. Percy’s business didn’t
die, but his utter failure as a prophet hasn’t discouraged
him in the least.

spread till it upset the Peacock Government and raised

“N.”: A new book, named “ Lumsden’s
Horse,” concerns Don Quixote and 250 other
Quixotes. When the news of the Magersfontdlfc
smash came through, Lumsden, a wealthy Indial[ '
planter, was staying at the Melbourne Club. He
slapped his tist on the mahogany, and declared it
should not be. .He immediately wired to his
friend Playfair, in Calcutta, an offer of 50,000
rupees towards fitting out a regiment of British
residents in India, as volunteers for S’Africa.
The corps of 250 was formed, at a cost of £19,500
sterling. The fellows were all swells, and yet
went for ordinary British cavalry pay, beginning
at Is. 2d. a day for privates. After nine months’
service, they were dead tired of patriotism and
disbanded.

My Melbourne correspondent continues :
“ Now that Justice Williams has retired, Holroyd
.T. is senior puisne judge. His grandfather, Sir
George Holroyd was an English judge. Of him
an old law magazine relates that when His Honor
was a young barrister, circuit chums dubbed him
‘ Selig Holroyd ’ because a Welsh woman, worried
by his cross-examination, demanded ‘Young
man, why do ye ask the likes o’ they selig (f.e.
silly) questions?’
“ Dr. Morrison, lately-deceased, who wore M.A.
and LL.D. after his name, won his spurs as a
schoolmaster, less, perhaps, by scholastic brilliance
than by tireless energy, organising skill, dauntless
courage in taking arms (if need be) against a sea
of boys, and also by his handsome appearance and
unfailing supply of social tact and charm in deal-
ing with parents. lie his ‘pluck,’ old boys still
remember how the ‘ bully boarder,’ a Herculean
lout of 20, defied * Old Morrison ’ and went to the
theatre against orders. The Doctor was having a
chat with a orony or two in his study when
he heard the mutineer come in. Instead of
hurrying upstairs to confront him, he placidly
finished off his little party and then read for a bit.
By this time, the big boy upstairs had branded
him as ‘frightened to tackle him,’ and was dozing
comfortably in bed. Suddenly he woke with a
start. Someone (the other boys, he supposed) was
flailing him through the bed-clothes like an insane
thrashing-machine. He roared—‘ Stop that! you
adjective fools; What are yer doin’?’ ‘l’m
flaggin’ye. Thats what I’m doin’!’ explained a
masterful Scotch voice, whose owner then went on
to flail harder than ever. At this a squeak of gig-
gles came from the surrounding beds, and for the
rest of the fray (for there was a fray) the rebel was
hampered by the fact that his assailant had turned
the laugh against him, not to speak of other disad-
vantages, such as inconveniently light costume
and the other man’s supple cane.
“ The she-fencers who are fascinated with the
foils had better guard against developing the
excessive and over-done suppleness of Norman
Partridge, whose swinging gait and loose-legged-
ness as Orlando in ‘As You Like It’ are attri-
buted to redundant sword-exercise. Fencing
is, like many other pleasant things, good in small
quantities. An over-dose of sword-drill spoils.
“The small snap-shotting fraternity, who charge
little more than a thanks a dozen, have Melbourne
literally by the no3e. The three most popular
attics are crowded from dawn to dark. You
penetrate dust, grit, stage-tinsel, broken-down
woodland scenes and Athenian backgrounds of a
dilapidated character, to get to the office (?).
There you get your number, and invoke the
suffering smile that is the special concomitant of
the camera, in a dusky hole that has a cracked
scrap of reflecting glass in a patch of the wall.
If you take your head-gear off, you place it upside
down on the one and only crazy chair—for obvious
reasons. When your number is called, you hustle
through the waiting smilers to the studio. That
studio defies a nib sketch. Out of the debris —
the shawls, boxes, boots, masks, candle-ends, tags
and banana-peels—you pick the camera’s eye
and cling to it. An unshaven machinist pulls
the trigger four times and you are hustled off.
When you give your mite and seize your dozen
effigies later on, you are agape with incredulity.
There glows your face—minus its freckles, black-
heads and wrinkles —encased in a Florentine
mount, or fronting a scene as gorgeous as a
Giorgione canvas, or peeping from a Spanish
garden hinting at rare delights. And that is
why all the smart folks this side crowd to the
cheap attics in Bourke and Collins streets.
“Melbourne women have followed the men in
the fashion of champagne-bottle sleeves. You
come across fat and short, long and lean, all with
a long neck slope Similarly, the toilettes take
en masse to the long-haired cloths. It is a Winter
of monotonous dressing and feminine discontent.
A few of the unhappy try to get away in smooth-
face materials, but to be in the fashion your dress
must be cat-haired. The plaids and tartans are
now a slump in the market. The melancholy
grey remains in absolute power, and colors are
a violent break away, only authorised by uncom-
mon good looks. The ordinary smart woman
must peg along in grey.
“ A seedy individual, in draughty pants, comes
now knocking at the suburban door with the
request, ‘Want yer ’and or yer ’ead read, ma’am?’
Since the palm romancers and the seers have been
switched off the city parlors, random cranks have
taken to the calling, and claim to lift the curtain
from Shadowland at an absurdly low figure.
' ‘ Marshall Hall describes Mark Hambourg as
‘an artist of altogether extraordinary powers,
who probably has hardly his equal in the world,’
and goes on to say that Mark’s nervous, original,
passionate temperament colors all he touches.
As a musician, the Hambourg of nowadays must
sometimes smile at his old self, the gifted but
exaggerated, unequal and sensational performer.
All the same, when people go out to enjoy them-
selves, they prefer a bill, not given up exclusively
to bric-a-brac. Mark’s own personality supplies
all the rococo an audience can assimilate, so it’s a
pity the rest of the concert fixtures did not
include less bare, crude ugliness. What with the
arctic cold of the Town Hall, the forlorn untidi-
ness of the platform, the hideous attire of sweet-
voiced little soprano Bachelor, and the blue
noses of suburban female hordes, it’s not sur-
prising that daily-paper puffsters had to gush
their sweetest to save the Hambourg season from
being a frost.
“Touching the ugliness ot Melbourne Eight
Hours’ Memorial The most absurdly hideous
specimen of memorial stone work in Melbourne is,
perhaps, the fountain erected at a breezy point of
the broad roadway in Elizabeth-street North.
The inscription on this public outrage state-s that
it is intended to immortalise the Duke of York’s
visit—and it looks the character. Nothing less
absurd could be expected of the person, or persons,
who seized the occasion of the opening of the
tirst Australian Parliament as an excuse for
reminding posterity of the little incidental duke
from England.
“One Federal dame watches the moods of her
spasmodic spouse narrowly, and always weighs
his utterances in the scales of her attested wis-
dom. Sometimes lie slips, verbally or politically,
and she is sorely put out. Anon he givesstrength
and volume to his pipings, and then she turns
proudly to the nearest Federal brother with
‘lsn’t John in great form to-night?’ It’s naive,
and the forlorn member, mayhap, envies the said
John ; but the women snort and wonder how an
enlightened member of the tempting sex can
pander so to her p trtner. Another clover dame,
whose Federal spouse is somewhat of the dull
Dogberry nature, never plays prompter or reviser
in public. She does all the worry, and tables all
her suggestions in their own little back Blooms-
bury, and sails into the galleries with an ostenta-
tious air of good-humor and want of interest.
The energies of Mrs. John Forrest are sought
by friends this side, but, so far, the Western dame
does not rush in with amusement plans. Those
croquet parties, and the subsequent troubles as to
t.ie exact ohalk-lining of the Ministerial and
Opposition mesdames in social corroborees, are
still a sore remembrance.
“An aristocratic affectation of the hour is a
limp of some kind—mostly with a cane accom-
paniment. In a leading hostelry lounge, the
other day, limping parties were the vogue. Two
mummers arrived for the tea corroboree in the
dot-and-carry-one-fashion. A smart dame fol-
lowed, leaning on a sturdy stick, and then a Lydia
oocurred, taking slow, languid steps with the aid
of a cane. After this procession of the lame and
halt, the ordinary sound skirt-whisker lost interest
m one s eyes, and the limping contingent with the
canes by their sides, seemed to own a novel
attraction. That’s how the craze starts, I hear.
The playful stick takes the fancy, and the handy
sprain ensues. The long hotel corridors provide
a favorable, promenade for the limpers, and when
a pensive air is worked up, the result is alleged to
be disturbing to the susceptible onlookers.
“ What hundreds London is calling ! Happen-
ing down at Port Melbourne the other day, was
struck at the sight of one of the tremendous
White Star liners, with decks crowded to the
gangway, just about to steam off. Several
hundreds were on board. The crowd was a mixed
one. Here and there artisan groups, clean,
strong, happy. Yonder, a batch of mud-com-
plexioned women whose pinchings for this trip
showed as traces of impoverishment in their faces;
then brusque business men, faded actresses, and
rovers, and a variety of seedy couples.
“ The newest scent device is secreted in the
fancy, hat-skewer. It rather serves a suitable pur-
pose in, say, a violet essence where millinery runs
in the direction of that flower. But one sees
danger ahead. Attar of roses will give out its
fragrant breath from a hat-plot of cornflowers or
decaying foliage. The thing will be to match your
hat-skewer scent to. your head appointments, and
not associate the like of myrrh with unsuitable
millinery.
“Allan and Co. have published, in large type,
a Manual of Scales and Arpeggios, by Mr. Frank-
lin Peterson, the convalescent professor of Melb.
University Conservatorium. A well-arranged
educational work. The scales in contrary motion,
with fingering, should be very useful, " and the
beginning on third note of scale is a good idea, as
this is a very frequent progression in classical
works. Another book for pianoforte students,
published as Allan’s Edition, contains 40 practical
exercises, going on Germer’s principles for double
notes, stretching, &c. H. W. Cambridge is
responsible.
Yours affectionately,
AKENEHI.
“ Polstan ” on the relative value of
things :
Many are the uses of the hairpin of woman, and next
to it in value comes the long, sharp hatpin. This is
mainly used in the aggressive. One of the Melbourne
Scottish Regiment recently had about three inches of
blue hatpin rammed into his calf as he stood at attention
on a crowded rbadway. He immediately formed himself
into a hollow square. On another occasion a trooper who
had been assisting to keep a crowd in order found a 10-
inch pin up to the hilt in his horse’s haunch when he was
rubbing the poor beast down after the parade. It didn’t
matter about the Scotchman, but to injure the horse was
a deed of beastly, unnecessary cruelty.
The black-coated brigade is always more
or less up in arms against the “ nakked wumman
that men hug a’ th’ nicht in a ballroom.” An
Australian thumper recently declared that half
the social evil in his district is due to “figure
dancing.” “That style of dancing,” he explained,
“is the one in which a man, any man, a pairfeet
stranger even, clasps the waist of a married or un-
married wumman whose upper body is covered
by two shoulder-straps only, and verra often the
man lays his cheek on the wumman’s bare shoulder,
as they go footing it round the room like a pair o’
trussed fowls. What else but sin—dawmnable
sin—can come from such a shameless proceeding ’ ”
W. N. Willis, M.L.A., as a land agent

Another instance of lovely woman’s daunt-
less spirit where matrimony is at stake. A
Ballarat bride-elect was dancing at a ball given in
honor of her impending alliance. During a square
dance the heroine became giddy—says the local
reporter—and “fell with great violence to the
floor, receiving severe cuts to her face in the
region of the eye, besides painful abrasions to her
head, also shock to the system.” The marriage
being due next day, the ball broke up under the
impression that a postponement would be neces-
sary to permit the lady to recover from her
one shock, fifteen outs and abrasions, and her
black eye. But her other eye took in the situation,
and in a partially-repaired and fully-decorated
state she came up smiling to the altar. She didn’t
turn giddy and fall when the parson said “ Wilt
thou take this man ? ” She just took him ‘‘ in the
presence of a large number of friends.”
According to Dr. Armstrong, Sydney
City Health Officer, it is rather the excep-
tion than the rule for the 40 odd munici-
palities of Sydney to enforce their own by-laws in
respect to cleanliness, and when the council’s
inspector does prosecute for a more than ordi-
narily glaring case of dirtiness, as often as not he
is compelled to withdraw the prosecution at the
instance of interested mayors or aldermen. In 38
out of 48 municipalities in and around Sydney the
sanitary inspector is also council clerk, or gutter-
sweeper, or office boy, or something ; and so he is
really no sanitary inspector at all for all practical
purposes ; and in but three out of those 48 dirty
boroughs are disinfecting operations attempted at
all. The result of this beautiful state of affairs is,
of course, typhoid. The huge municipality of
Balmain, with a population of over 30,000, lias
but one sanitary inspector to see that it keeps
itself clean ; and it uses its park as a tip (as a rule
the park is used as a tip, just as an alderman, if
presented with a priceless work of art, would
naturally keep it in the pigsty). Balmain, with
but six per cent, of the metropolitan population,
has twenty-two per cent, of the total typhoid cases
of the metropolis ! When is that Greater Sydney
scheme coming along, to consign the dirty-minded
local alderman to his well-earned oblivion in tb*
public ash-barrel ?
The East-Australian fashion of using the
revolver as a means of removing an enemy or a best
girl, is matched in Groperland by the growing
taste for dynamite. It is not very long since a
parcel, received through the post by a Perth man,
blew the recipient’s arm off on delivery. And
now there comes the tale of a lady who was sent
upwards by the same means. The detectives
affirm that a short piece of fuse was attached to
a dynamite percussion-cap and placed in a piece
of firewood, with the result that, when the lady
was entertaining a friend at tea beside her own
grate, the fire blew up violently, seriously injuring
the hostess, and removing the whole of the chim-
ney and the best part of the room. The police
have arrested the mother of a girl with whom the
injured woman’s husband had once “kept com-
pany,” before marrying his present wife. It is to
be hoped she, and her sex generally, will be
cleared of the charge. Woman was comparatively
safe while she only used a gun; she seldom hit
anything with that, except a spectator occa-
sionally. With dynamite or a hat-pin she is
about as dangerous as a man.
Sydney Freeman’s Journal publishes a
fantastic sketch of the British Empire in the year
2000. The King “abnegates” his throne, and
“ dismisses ” the few remaining barons who refuse
to resign their privileges and act up to the spirit
of the times. “The people throng the streets,
small factions walking gaily along singing the
well-known Hymn of Liberty, which had been
composed some years before in honor of the Peace
Movement.” Even when all is well, and every-
body is happy, there are still factions. It is an
Irish need. Erin’s land laws are “copied in
every portion of the habitable world.” The
Dean of Cashel, addressing a monster meet-
ing in Phoenix Park, says:—“The people in
their ways of paying homage to God, are as
tolerant and unwise {sic) as their constitution.”
The population of Ireland has increased to

the statement— “In Salthouse, Norfolk, a duck
has been hatched with four legs and two tails.”

From the Wesley Church Signal
(l/6/’O3) eu
“ Matilda” is leaving Sydney, returning to Fiji. She
is a sweet, good-tempered girl. The Sunday School
children love “ Matilda.” Mrs. Lindsay and family will
miss her very much. Her training reflects great credit
on Mrs. Lindsay. Several presents were made to
“ Matilda.” The Young Men’s Institute could not refrain
from showing their love to her by giving a present.
If she were a white girl the Wesley paper would
call her Miss Matilda Smith, or, at the very least,
Matilda. Being a brown girl, she is “ Matilda,”
in inverted commas, as if she were a bear at the
Zoo. How these holy people love to patronise
their “ pore colored sister ”!
Quaint item from a North of Scotland
paper about how the descendants of the old
Vikings live in Shetland :
Sheriff Shennan has just given his decision in a breach
of promise case which was raised in the Lerwick Sheriff
Court some time ago at the instance of a young woman
named Robina Georgeson, residing at Melby, Sandness,
against a sailor named Walterson, residing at the same
place. The damages were laid at £lOO. The Sheriff finds
that there is a custom prevailing to some extent in
Shetland, and known as Shetland courtship, in pursuance
of which young men during winter visit their sweethearts
at night, and frequently sleep with them without un-
dressing. He also finds that, from October, 1890, to
April, 1891, the defender, in accordance with this
custom, visited the pursuer, and slept with her ; that in
April, 1891, the defender went south as a sailor, and
thenceforward corresponded with the pursuer till his
return to Shetland at the end of December, 1893 ; that
between October, 1890, and December, 1893, the defender
courted the pursuer, but the pursuer has failed to prove
that he promised to marry her. . . . Mr. Robertson,
solicitor, in addressing the Sheriff on behalf of the de-
fender, is reported by the Shetland Times to have said
in the course of his remarks that the custom of Shetland
courtship was to go away and sleep together two or three
nights a-week. Defender said he never dreamed of such
a thing or thought of such a thing as marriage until he
got the letter. This was followed by another letter, which
contained a most startling statement. Referring further
to the evidence, he said pursuer denied that she had s'ept
with John Cheyne, and she did not remember if he had
promised to marry her, but Kate Campbell, in the wit-
ness box, stated that John Cheyne courted her, and
slept with her while she was in Melby. After that, when
pursuer’s evidence was taken in chambers, she admitted
having slept with John Cheyne, but she said she did so
because he was her cousin. He submitted that so far as
the parish of Sandness was concerned, this practice of
young people sleeping together was just a winter amuse-
ment. Young men came home from sea and looked for a
girl to spend the winter with, and to get the news of the
parish they did what was called sleeping together.

Melbourne Tocsin has been publishing the
pedigrees and past histories of Bent’s black beg
pardon, loyalists—and has thereby roused the ire
of certain individuals who urged the Minister to
hold an inquiry as to how the intelligence leaked
out. The Tocsin will probably be “ suppressed ”
when the Irvine gang meets again.
S.A. Parliament usually meets early in
June (this custom has been almost a fixture for 22
years), but Opposition-Leader and virtual Premier
Darling is away in England, and he seems to have
issued orders to his minion, Jenkins Iscariot, to
wait till he comes back. Consequently Jenkins
will not meet his faithful followers in a strong
American accent till July.
Those politicians who are babbling about
the “cost” of the Federal High Court, are hereby
invited to consider that the abolition of the useless
State Governors would cover the cost twice over.
The High Court has certain duties to perform
which no other institution can do. The State
Governor chiefly opens bridges which would open
naturally without his assistance.
Senator Higgs has been the first this ses-
sion to break away from the Labor party’s attitude
of ladylike complaisance, with a notice of motion
condemning Vic. Gov. Clarke’s meddling with
Australian politics by advocating the naval sub-

offensive to the “best circles,” but it is un-
doubtedly necessary, and courageous withal.
The cables that appear in the Sydney
morning papers would, as a rule, create the
impression that Britain has risen as one man
against Chamberlain’s Protectionist proposals.
Yet things leak out occasionally even in their
columns. The other day they recklessly admitted
that, in the Midland Counties of England alone,
1000 manufacturers had joined anew Protectionist
league.
The latest N.S.W. Public Service sensa-
tion is in connection with a messenger. „The
messengers are entitled, of course, to ‘ ‘ run ” the
public offices, but this particular one seems to
have gone beyond even the high privileges and
perquisites of a messenger. Probable that the
matter will be hushed up. A messenger is a
messenger, and it would be almost unconstitu-
tional to punish him.
Human flesh is not the only thing that is
grass. Announced last week that the British
Government had x'efused to purchase the Spanish
cable, as no one could foretell to what extent
ethergrams would presently supersede cables. If
cables snuff out, land communication by wire will
not long survive them. Then where will be
another £4,000,000 worth of our “ permanent and
reproductive ” loan works ?
The Irvine-Bent gang is still dealing out
their “justice” to the Vic. railway drivers and
firemen. Several who desire to leave the service
for foreign parts cannot get their “clearances”
from the Government. One man in particular,
having on offer a lucrative position in S’Africa,
has been on his knees (d la Peacock) for weeks
past, in a hitherto vain attempt to obtain his
clearance and insurance policy.
A good motion before the House of Reps,

a bonus of a half-penny per lb. on “ginned”
cotton grown and ginned in the Commonwealth,
and £2500 to the person first producing cotton
goods of the value of £5OOO from cotton grown in
Australia. There is room in the Commonwealth
for a great cotton industry ; and a bonus, with a
high tariff, is the way to create it.
Queensland Premier Philp, during his
recent tour up as far as the Gulf country, only
once addressed a public meeting of the electors
and that was at his stronghold, Townsville ; and
even there, despite favors past and to come, his
reception was painfully mixed. He returned say-
ing the country was obviously with him. In
many places the country showed rather an incli-
nation to rise up and fall on top of him.
Members of the Australian Parliament do
not seem to take the trouble to study the Aus-
tralian Constitution. It has been repeatedly
urged during the debate on the Judicature Bill
that “ the State Courts with the Privy Council
would serve all necessary purposes for awhile.”
But the Australian Constitution prohibits appeals
to the Privy Council —except by leave of the
Federal High Court—on Constitutional matters.
The Northern J.P. always makes things

In the case of one Ah Duck, charged with supply-

discharged the accused, on the ground that
they believed the woman did actually receive
liquor from Ah Duck, but then they believed
she got grog somewhere else also. And these
be the J’s.P. by the grace of the Philpocracy.
There seems to be ground for the sus-
picion that Raven Shiels is at the bottom of
the Icicle Government’s swindling of its em-
ployees. Just before the strike Bent repeatedly
promised the immediate payment of the long
overdue increments to those getting less than
£125 a year. Irvine also said he was surprised
to hear they had not been paid—and promised
prompt redress. T’other day the Age asked
the Commissioners for a little light on this
very shady matter, and Fitzpatrick frankly
replied ‘‘ he was ready to pay; he was only
awaiting the Minister’s authority.” As the
financial year closes this month it looks as
if Shiels was doing another mean trick to
make his deficit smaller by the few pounds
thus saved.
Mr. Yes-No Reid is now in favor of pre-
ferential treatment of British goods* ‘if the present
tariff is maintained.” In 1897, as reported by
London Daily News, Mr. Reid said :
As to the various proposals for an Imperial Zollverein
and preferential duties in favor of British goods, he con-
demned them outright. Canada might do as she pleased,
but in his opinion the British Empire was better main-
tained by its present policy of Freetrade, even with
enemies, than it could be in any other way.
The Russianising of Finland is said to be
proceeding apace. So is the Russianising of Vic-
toria. A policeman at Ballarat is being hauled
over the coals by his superior officers for being
present in plain clothes, in his own time, and as a
private individual, at a meeting addressed by
Tom Mann. In Victoria very soon nobody will
have any liberty at all except Bent. And he won’t
have any liberty—only license to be brutally
objectionable.
John Haynes, M.L.A., proposes to settle
people on the land in N.S.W. by “drastic reduc-
tions in railway fares.” Bujt the people witli free
railway passes don’t settle on the land. Some of
them don’t even settle their bills. And if people
have to be paid to go on the land by being carried
to and fro largely at the cost of the city worker,
in addition to having their produce carried (as at
present) at one-fourth the rate charged to the
manufacturer, doesn’t the backbone of the country
begin to look very like a miserable pauperised
soup-ticket ? Also, any good bit of land made
available is already, applied for ten times over,
and the reduction of railway fares won’t make
land.
“T.D.” on the
“ overpaid publio
servant ” myth :
Was talking- yester-
day to a constituent
of Bully Bent, who
had just been in see-
ing that burly poten-
tate and using his in-
fluence to get some-
thing done which
probably should not
have been done. Said
he, “Now, Tom’s a
great man, isn’t he?
I told the messenger
I come from Brighton,
and he made no bones
about showing me in,
you bet. When I told
Tommy my business,
he just sent for one of
them £BOO -a - year -
men and said* ‘This
is Mr. Blank, just see
that he gets what he
wants, and be quick
-about it.’ The £BOO-
a-year-man looked , . tol i
scared, but mustered up courage enough to ten
Bent it was in some other chap s department.
The other £BOO-a-year-man said it wasn t_ in ms
branch either, but he thought it was m some
other chap’s. Then another £BOO-a-year-fellow was
brought in, and he explained that it was not one
concerns, but the business was in the Lands, Im g g
up there now with a note from Bent telling them a
constituent of bis, and I’ve got to be treated properly.
I remarked quietly that I had been waiting outside Bent
door throughout his interview with that personage,
had only seen one public servant called in, and
affluent sponger on the public purse was a man
managed a whole branch department for £o a •
Also, I informed him that, up in the Lands Department,
the man who would put his business through would p -
bably be a clerk on £176 a year, minus percentage reduc-
tion, with 30 men under his control. Though
moment crestfallen, I have no doubt that Bents trust-
worthy constituent has since been assiduously infecting
his friends with rancor against six mythical
public servants.
After all the alleged economy which was
to result from Bent’s cutting down of the Vic-
torian railway-passenger service, the Age laments
that there is, after all, “ practically no saving.
There are still 63 trains a day to St. Kilda. On the
Sandringham line (which loses £9OO a week) there
are 23 trains a day instead of the former 24 ; and
so on. The only real difference is that the
are more erratic in their time-keeping, and the
engine breaks down six times instead of once.
Already the Freetrade Tories are smelling
round to see whether it is any.use nominating a
candidate against Trades Minister Kingston tor
Adelaide district at the Federal elections in
December. But it is pretty certain that before
nomination day comes they will discover
that the man to beat “ Charley ” has yet to be
born. Kingston is a native of the constituency
for which he intends to stand, and for 20 years he
represented a part of it in the State Parliament.
Senator Staniforth Smith contributes to
Sydney Telegkaph a valuable article on Papuan
conditions. He condemns the absurdity of
allowing big grants to land-grab co’s., plumps for
a leasehold system of land-tenures, and shows
that to be the only way to a steady and healthy
development. To encourage settlement in Papua
he reckons the Commonwealth should give its
Possession tariff preference, on articles which do
not come into competition with Australian
products.
The Iceberg Government, having silenced
the railway employees, is turning its attention to
certain Vic. school-teachers who lifted up their
voices against the Reform Bill and separate repre-
sentation, and one who made an extra loud noise
is being “dealt with.” It’s not known whether
drawing and quartering or boiling oil will be the
result, or whether he’ll get off with the loss of
pension and compensation rights. What splendid
inquisition bosses Irvme and his Ancient Bent
would have made !
The fact that the Victorian mercantile
community has entered no protest against alleged
Senator Reid representing it in the Common-
wealth Parliament goes to show two things:
(1) That its sympathies are with customs frauds;
(2) that it feels that the representative of a firm
which has been convicted of defrauding the cus-
toms is a fit and proper individual to speak for his
fellow importers. The political existence of
Robert Reid is in itself sufficient justification of
Kingston’s watchfulness.
Australian Treasurer Turner, who knows
as mf!ch about finance as any man in Australia,
reckons that Kingston keeps the expenses of his
department down to £lO,OOO below what might
fairly be expected, simply by the vigor with which
he abjures every semblance of “frill.” If Aus-
tralia paid Kingston £5OOO a year he would be
cheap at the price. So would Turner. At present
Australia has the amazing luck to get such
financiers as Kingston and Turner at about one-
tenth their value, but the luck can hardly last.
S.A. Premier *:o a labor deputation asking
for compulsory arbitration :
He believed that the majority of the best manufac-
turers would be in favor of some legislation that would
prevent the possibility of strikes, provided that the
legislation was of such a character as would not place
them at a disadvantage with the manufacturers in the
other States.
A fair enough proviso, and pointing again to the
conclusion that industrial legislation must be
made a Federal matter. '
Writes George Pile—or it may be his dog
—on the prosperity of a Protectionist country :
The American papers, which I have been carefully
studying, tell us no tales about a permanent unemployed
section of the people—thej- are in abundant evidence
here, the product of the Labor party microbe. Before
the advent of that party these were non-existent.
Will George Pile —or his the pro-
ceedings of the old Legislative Council before
Responsible Government, and note the votes that
were put on the Estimates to relieve the chronic
unemployed of Sydney? Also, will he hunt up
the records of a long ago Commission of which the
then young and rising Parkes was a member,
which sat to consider the unemployed question of
that day ?
OVER-LEGISLATION.
And yet the bird wonders he can't fly!
The Omrah shipped at Port Melbourne
last week 250 tons of harvesting machinery for
Buenos Ayres, via London. This was built by
Nicholson and Morrow, of Carlton (Melb.), who
have already this year shipped 250 tons to ’Frisco
and have still another lot to go to Argentina.
Will Reid or M'Millan kindly explain how it is
that Protection, which, they say, raises the price to
the consumer, enables these harvesters to pay a
vastly heavier freight and yet beat British goods
in a market that used to be mainly British ?
Importer M‘Millan, in one of his recent
Parliamentary wails, said that Customs Minister
Kingston started on the assumption that nine-
tenths of importers were swindlers. Considering
that an influential deputation of importers
(Robert Reid and Co. being among the firms
represented) assured Kingston that at the single
port of Brisbane the softgoods importers alone
swindled the customs out of -£250,000 in three
years (£83,000 a year), which was something like a
quarter of the revenue, it would be no wonder if
Kingston did think that.
When N.S.W. Justice Pring decided that
a soldier, however vilely he might be swindled in
the matter of his pay, had no legal redress, there
was a huge and silly orifice or discrepancy per-
vading the whole argument. The talk, gabble
and judicial fuss was mainly based on the theory
that if the soldier was granted the right to sue his
employer, the State, while still serving in the
army, he might burst up the campaign by apply-
ing for injunctions and other large blue docu-
ments. And the principal problem before the
court was whether a soldier, after he had left the
army and become a private and, perhaps, some-
what drunken citizen again, had a right to sue for
his back wages, when his action couldn’t affect
the campaign in any way.
Robert Reid and Co., the softgoods firm
of alleged Senator Reid, has compounded the rest
of its customs offences, which seem to be
numerous. Queensland Supreme Court gave
Minister Kingston authority to accept a fine
without further legal expenses. Two clauses in.
the report are significant:
This order for leave to compound shall have the same
effect for all purposes as if judgment had been given for
plaintiff in respect of offences alleged in the statement of
claim. . . . Defendants thought the course now adopted,
namely, that of a settlement, the better one, and consider
they have been met in a very fair way by the representa-
tives of the Commonwealth Customs Department.
Which seems to convey: (1) That the softgoods
firm gives up the pretence that it isn t guilty; (2)
that it ceases to profess that it was prosecuted out
of private animosity, and admits that it is being
treated quite as well as it deserves.
HIS ONLY HOPE.
“The one material source of Australia’s greatness, if
it ever is to become great, must be —Australia.” — Aus-
tralian paper.
The S.A. Parliamentary Commission on
Railways is finding out things which would make
a less dead-tired country jump. For instance
(Engineer-in-Chief under examination): —
What was your estimate for the Outer Harbor Rail-
way ?—£BB3o, and the contractor’s price was £9740.
What was the consideration which gave the work to-
the private contractor?—lt was because the pendulum,
had swung completely the other way. Formerly every-
thing had to be done departmentally, and now everything;
has to be done by contract.
“Everything has to be done by contract,” even,
though the public has to bleed for it! Well, the-
S.A. public knew, or might have known, what it
was doing when last election it plumped for
Jenkins Iscariot.
This is the record of Dry Dog Reid, the
shuffler, time-server, and somersaulter, re the
Bill for the establishment of a Federal High
Court:
(1) Early last session he said there-was no hurry-
about it.
(2) When the Bill turned up, he opposed it bitterly,
and (he says) he was the cause of it not passing.
(3) Early in the recess, he boasted publicly that he had
prevented it passing.
(4) Later in the recess, he denounced the Barton
Government for not passing it, and urged that it should
be the very first measure of the new session.
(5) When it was introduced as the first measure of the
new session Reid didn’t support it and didn’t vote for it.
He stayed away. But his principal iollowers, presumably
by his direction, for the leader of the Opposition is.
supposed to direct the Opposition policy, fought bitterly
against the Bill which their leader had declared to be-
urgent and essential, and almost unanimously declared*
that a High Court wasn’t wanted.
A man may get to some kind of success by theses
tactics, but it is a very dirty kind of success..

Liver Complaint, Indigestion,
and Ceneral Weakness,
ALL SOCCUMB TO
VITA D ATI O
August 19, 1901.
Mr. S. A. PALMER,
Agent for Webber’s VITADATIO.
Dear Sir, —I wish to add m.v testimony to the value of
VITADATIO. For over five years I was a great sufferer
from Liver Complaint, Indigestion and General Weakness.
1 was unable to follow my usual occupation, and for three
years had been under several medical men ; I have also
taken courses of almost all the well-known patent medi-
cines without any beneficial results. Whilst living at
Maryborough, about two years ago, I heard of the
wonders being performed through the agency of VITA-
DATIO, and, after making enquiries, I decided to give it
a trial, which I did, with the result that at the present
time I am fully restored to health, and feel it my duty to
let others know what VITADATIO has done for me. I
will be glad to answer any enquiries about my case
personally or by' letter, which must have stamped
addressed envelope enclosed.
I remain, Yours gratefullv,
. WILLIAM STEWART DRUMMOND,
11 Erroll-street, Carlton. Late of Maryborough.

One of the loudest laughs the House of
Reps, has heard for a long time arose at the
frantic flight of Spruce Myth when Kingston rose
to reply to his attack during the Address-in-Reply
debate. Myth was beautifully dressed and
brilliantined, and he danced to the table on tip-
toe and poured forth the vials of his ladylike
wrath on Kingston, and the big Minister lay back
and smiled. Then, when Kingston rose to reply,
there was a vision of a beautiful suit of clothes
bolting through the door, and a smell of hair-oil
flying through the corridor, and Spruce Myth was
gone.
Premier Philp moaning in North Queens-
land :
In responding to a toast at Townsville, he said he
thought that Australia would give North Queensland
justice some day, after they had dispensed with the pre-
sent insane legislation which the Federal Government
had passed to please a section of the people.
Of course, that legislation was passed “to please,
a section of the people ’’ —the larger section.
Under the Australian Constitution the larger
section rules. And Philp wants this legislation
repealed to please “a section of the people ” —the
smaller section. Meanwhile, the smaller section
pretends to regard it as an outrage that it doesn’t
rule.
INDICATION OF CROUP.
Hoarseness in a child that is subject to croup
is a sure indication of the approach of the disease.
If Chamberlain’s Cough Remedy is given as soon
as the child becomes hoarse, or even after the
croupy cough has appeared, it will prevent the
attack. It always cures, and cures quickly.

Illuminating item from Sydney D.T.’s
Canadian correspondent, printed by that paper
v ithout it being noted that it was loaded:—
Vancouver, B.C., May 2.—The vessels of the line from
Vancouver to Sydney always leave here with a full eariro,
but they invariably come from the Antipodes light. So
great is the demand at this port for cargo space in the
steamers of the Canadian-Australian line that shippers
must now contract three months in advance for it.
Under present conditions in Australia there seems to be
an unlimited market for American and Canadian pro-
ducts.
Bo highly-protected Canadian manufacturers have
to book space three months ahead for shipping
their goods to Australia, whilst low tariff Aus-
tralia, doing nothing but consuming the Canadian
goods and paying for them out of borrowed
money, has to return the ship light because it has
nothing to send in exchange 1

About the Stows :—
Only one is left now of the elder branch of the Stow
family which, one way and another, had a very great
deal to do with the making of S.A. The father, the Rev.
T. q., was the province’s first regular parson, apart from
the official chaplain. A Congregationalist, he is to be
remembered chiefly for the great and successful fight he
made against the proposed introduction of State aid to
religion. Unlike N.S.W., S.A. has no rev. pensioners.
Stow Church, where the late ex-Professor Roby Fletcher
had a pulpit for years, is liis memorial. This Rev.
T. Q. left three sons who became notable. Randolph
Ishani, the eldest, was probably the most successful
lawyer the province has reared, four times Attorney-
General, and Supreme Court Judge for a year or
two until his untimely death. A younger son, Augus-
tine—he who had an apoplectic fit as he was walking
through an Adelaide park a fortnight ago, and never
recovered—had a precarious political career from 1863 to
1871. He reached office once, under Strangways, as Chief
Secretary. It was one of S.A.’s numerous very sudden
Ministries ; it came in and went out inside a fortnight.
Augustine, who wasn’t built for Parliamentary hurly-
burly, dropped in to the Public Service, and slum-
bered comfortably thereafter as Chief Clerk of the
Supreme Courts. The second brother, Jefferson Pick-
man, still lives—he put in a few strenuous years as editor
of S.A. Advertiser in its struggling democratic days, un-
til S’langdon Bonython developed journalistic aspirations
of his own. Then J.P. too dropped into a State billet,
being appointed Police Magistrate.

A Russian Jew told a Sydney evening
paper lately something about the Jews of
Odessa and Kishnieff that makes one wonder at
the recent massacres. According to him, the
Jews are not extortionate money-lenders, as the
Russian law prevents more than a “certain per-
centage” being charged. What the percentage
is he did not explain, but contented himself with
saying that it was a very small one. But some
men would consider 250 per cent, per annum dirt
cheap. In Kishnieff the Chosen form, he says,
about half the population. Also, they have a
“quarter” almost entirely tothemselves, in which
the houses are built of stone, round quadrangular
spaces, with huge iron entrance gates. Such
places ought to be veritable fortresses, and, given
a supply of iron bars and plenty of boiling
water, ought to have held out against the fury of a
mere unarmed rabble. A correspondent who saw
the Armenian massacre in Constantinople some
years ago told of how, from a tower, he saw 15
Armenians, armed to the teeth, on a house-top.
They had at least three revolvers each and every
man of them a rifle and a sword. A Turkish
officer riding past caught sight of them and dis-
mounted, tied up his horse, climbed on to the
roof with only a scimitar, while the correspondent
waited to see his mangled remains flung down on
the crowd below. But the trembling Armenians
merely threw themselves on their knees, and the
Turkish officer slew the lot, and, being somewhat
tired thereby, sat on one dead body and quietly
6moked a cigarette afterwards. Supposing that
Jewish quarter of Kishnieff had been held by
men like the Spaniards who held Saragossa !

The itinerant vendors who shout in the
streets something that sounds like “Boiled

do Well by migrating to Russia just now. Almost
anything that sounds like damaged rabbi seems to
he in vogue there.

EMERSON.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
The centenary of Emerson—born May 25, 1803
—has just passed. Dr. Garnett tells us, in his
biography of the Sage, that “at an early age he
contracted an evil habit of sucking his thumb.”
The ways of the wise at an early age, and the ways of the
foolish wight,
Give hints of the days to come.
Did Turner draw with a charcoal stick? Did Mozart
music write?
Well, Emerson sucked his thumb.
What though his mother cased his hands in mittens of
knitted wool ?
Ay ! what though she spanked him some ?
Yet the hand of Fate stretched out to him as he sat on
his little stool,
And Emerson sucked his thumb.
n later life he was grave and calm, and he kept his mind
serene
’Mid the world’s vast, busy hum ;
While some through greed or creed went mad, and some
through love or spleen,
Old Emerson sucked his thumb.
On Egypt’s plain as he saw the Sphinx and gazed on its
battered face,
The Sphinx thought, “ This is rum,’’
And murmured low, “You’re another, then.’’ Of sur-
prise he showed no trace—
No 1 Emerson sucked his thumb.
Philosophers, some with tongue in cheek, or with fingers
stretched from the nose,
Or banging the blatant drum,
Have waxed dogmatic o’er systems vague. Their mean-
ing ? Goodness knows !
But Emerson sucked his thumb.
1 see him there in his Concord home, with his lofty tran-
quil brow,
In his meditations dumb.
But flashing thoughts like electric sparks betimes ; and
I’m glad, somehow,
That Emerson sucked his thumb.

disorders arising from imperfect digestion. They
get at the cause where other so-called remedies
give only temporary relief, leaving the system in
worse condition than before. They touch the
liver, and make the stomach clean and pure,
assisting the nutritive and digestive orgnns m
properly assimilating the food. Dr. Morses
Indian Root Pills are a perfect blood purifier and
a permanent and positive cure for biliousness,
indigestion, constipation, headaches, sallow com-
plexion, liver and kidney troubles, piles, pimples,
boils and blotches, and for female ailments.

SPORTING NOTIONS.
The big dividends on the wet Birthday Cup day
in Adelaide were responsible for some curious financing.
Two brokers arranged with a bookmaker that they should
be considered to have a pound on every starter all through
the afternoon, at “ tote odds.” They divided £24 profit
between them. A lady, who tried the same thing on a
smaller scale, neglected to arrange for the removal of the
usual 15 to 1 limit that the local Man with the Bag
imposes ; consequently, with 17 starters in the Oup, she
lost on the race, although the dividend was £59 Is. ! In
another transaction, however, it was the Philistine who
scored. Late in the afternoon, when big dividends were
the usual thing, a sporting lawyer sold, for £27 10s., a
ticket on an outsider that had just won. The purchaser
was a bookmaker, and 10 minutes later the dividend was
declared as £l4 18s. (£4O had been confidently expected,
but a small run on the number just before the start
brought the odds down). It was also stated that a local
theatre-manager spent £l7 in “ backing the lot ” in the
Oup, and, on sorting out his tickets afterwards to collect
the £59, found that he had inadvertently backed one
horse twice, and missed one—the winner 1
• * • •
Walter Hickenbotham, trainer of old Carbine
and a dozen other of the best, after about 40 years’ expe-
rience : “I think Carbine was the best horse Australia
ever saw. He would always do his best. Up to a mile
and a-half Newhaven was faster, I honestly believe, but
was hardly so reliable. The Barb stood out at his time
just as Carbine did in his. Newhaven did the most bril-
liant trials I ever saw. Then Mostyn—up to a mile, I
doubt whether even Marvel was his superior. The best
mare we have seen—Wakeful. Quiver and La Carabine
were good. And the fastest two-year-old was Wigelmar.
She could fly. If she had trained on, there is no know-
ing what she might have done.”
* * * * *
Annotate—that most in-and-out of performers
—ran some awfully bad races at the Adelaide meetings.
Hence the probability that Scobie’s occasional surpriser
will do big things in the Spring.
* * * *
Tote operations at Port Adelaide Club’s meet,
Saturday, ran anything but smoothly. Immediately
prior to fifth race working-battery petered out, and
tickets had to be given by hand, which caused consider-
able delay. Machine went all right for next and last
event, but announcement printed on programme that
dividends would be paid on second horse when 12 or
more started created more bother. Ten lined up, and
lots of people with second-horse tickets destroyed them
only to hear later that 12 was a misprint—it should have
been 10. Backers of the winner kicked vigorously against
any of the money going to second nag, and claimed that
they should get it all. Many refused the dividend, vow-
ing they would go for the full amount, while others
accepted it under protest.
Ernest Brodribb, the Australian turf-plunger
of a dozen years ago, died in London the other week,
aged 43. Brodribb seemed to take Ernest Benzon, the
“Jubilee Juggins” for his model, but whereas Benzon
dissipated his fortune before it fell due to him, Brodribb
played with readv money. He gambled every way, and
was “rooked” all the time. It was in 1890 that young
Brodribb, an amiable, bright-looking fellow, paid 4600
guineas for the two-year-old gelding Titan. The animal
proved a disastrous purchase for the plunger, but showed
some good form after it was sold for a moderate sum to
Donald Wallace. Poor Brodribb’s horses were trained
with Wallace’s choice little lot ; nevertheless, he suffered
through his connection with the stable, for when Carbine
won the Melbourne Cup in 1890 Brodribb had backed his
own horse, Prince Consort, likewise Tantallon (another
stable companion of the famous top-weight), and other
starters and non-starters—but the name of Carbine was
not written in his book. A singularly wrong-headed
plunger, with his heart in the right place.
The wealth of Edmond Blanc, whose horses ran
first second, and third for the Grand Prix of Paris, last
week, is derived from the Monte Carlo casino. Ranking
as “one of France’s foremost sportsmen” and finest
fashionables, Blanc is just the keeper of a gambling hell,
writ large. The character of gambling hellmonger is
brilliant or shady according to the vastness or littleness
of the hell.
* * * *
The tote’s alluring odds once again. A field of
five lined up for a £2O stake at Ashburton (M.L.), and
an old chestnut named Beira, reckoned to have a dog’s
chance, got his head in front, and paid £44. There was
only 30s. on him in the machine.
Jockey J. Cameron, who recently rode winner
(Awahuri) in Wanganui (M.L.) Handicap, has had heaps
more than a fair share of close calls. Found out by some
one that 14 nags have been killed under Cameron, his
collarbone has been broken six times and dislocated once,
while “shakings” innumerable have happened to him.
Surely this is without a parallel the world over.
• * * *
An inconsequential-looking prad, possessing as
much brilliancy as an antiquated steam tram, galloped
home a winner in M.L. recently, for the first time in three
years and gave his owner such a shock that he fainted.
Transpired afterwards that the owners of the other ned-
dies all quietly backed him and waited to see if he really
could win when he had nothing to beat. '
* * * *
N.S.W. and Victoria have been doing a good
export trade to M.L., during the past year or so, in the
wav of “ ringers.” But there seems, to be reciprocity
between the States in this direction, as a prominent
sport recognised five Maoriland noddies while on a visit
to the Commonwealth—all racing under aliases.

Wootton’s high-class track performer, but huge
failure with the colors up—Grafton gelding Euston—was
liberally supported (down to 5 to 2) for Parramatta Mile,
at Rosehill (Sydney), Saturday, and won by a head only,
from Ariana. Incentive for putting on most of the coin
was that, earlier in the day, Euston finished a good third
in Clyde Stakes (6 fur.) after being last into straight, and
was coming so fast that a mile would have seen, him an
easy winner. Yet the success was lucky, for both Ariana
and Bombshell (third) should have beaten Euston, but
former’s effort was delayed too long, and latter was last
to leave barrier. t , ,
Big surprise of Rosehill meet on Saturday was
success of Dan O’Connell in Clyde Stakes (6fur.) for
which he started an outsider—lo to 1. Turquoise was
very solidlv supported at 5 to 2, and lots of shekels went
into Mo’s satchel over La Blaize’s prospects. Both these
were settled at the distance and D.O’C. scored with a bit
to the good. Winner is by Gozo—Concussion, and eight
years old. His biggest success was Flying Handicap
(£200) at A.J.O. April meet four years since.. Most
recent triumph prior to last Saturday s occurred in con-
Uection with Q.T.C.’s New Handicap at Brisbane over 12
months ago. , » *
Kogarah-trained two-year-old filly Graft (5 to 1
ae-ainsSl easily annexed Rosehill Nursery Handicap,
Saturday,- humping top weight (9.5), and conceding from
14 to 351bs. to others in the field. After making the
running with Ravenshoe till entering the straight Graft
streaked away from everything. Filly Reverie also
trained at Kogarah, lined up a warm first choice (at 2 to
1) and evidenced high class pace qver portion of the trip,
but never had a look in at the finish.
• * *.*...
Rosehill June Handicap, on his showing in
A J C Prince of Wales Stakes previous Monday, looked
giiraly Mechlin’s, for he then finished a close third in
much better company, and was only asked to carry 41b.
more on Saturday last. However, like many other race-
course “certainties,” though well placed over the greater
Dart of the distance, he could get no nearer than fifth in
the end. Nahpro, finishing very wide, won with a lot to
spare from rank outsider No Name. #
The victory of Elorin in the Birthday Handicap,
at recent V.R.O. meeting, was another illustration of the
fact that horses are apt to be all the -better for having
taken things easy on the track after being properly wound
up. Florin’s recent performances in S.A. were not very
satisfactory, although he took the Onkaparinga Oup.
Subsequently the son of St. Swithin met with a slight mis-
hap, and, returning to Melbourne, he was not given much
work until he went out, unfancied, for the Birthday
Handicap, and won by sheer gamenese. In losing
“ condition ” the 6-year-old animal had gained vigor.
• * * *
Entries for Epsom Handicap and Metrop., the
two big events of A.J.O. Spring meeting, show a small
shortage as compared with last year. Epsom has 107—7
less, and Metrop. 97—4 less. Victorians have nominated
liberally, and Queensland and Maoriland are well repre-
sented. Each race has 29 who’ll be syrs. old at the time
of running ; 4-year-olds total 52 ; 3-year-olds, 41; 6-year-
olds and aged nags number 26, but, as a whole, their
prospects do not impress much.
Newcastle scales tampering case is, like similar
discoveries at Moorefield (Sydney) and Brisbane, still, as
far as the law is aware, the act of “ some person or per-
sons unknown.” Attorney-General refused to file a bill
against owner (Kingsley) and jockey (Moran) of Gentle-
man Jim (in connection with whose weighing the trouble
occurred), but Newcastle Jockey Club has disqualified
both, and a couple of others, for life. Evidence against
the two named was not strong; they are appealing to
the A.J.O.

Kalgoorlie (W.A.) racecourse is shortly to be
blessed with a brand-new brick totalisator, 200 ft.

quence, there’s much wailing amongst the “ bookies ”
on the goldfields. There’ll be a serious attempt to have
the new building up for the big August meetings ; and
the healthy turn horse-racing has taken in the West
amply justifies the buying-up of some of the best
sprinters from N.S.W.—'notably The Persian and Skein
Dhu.

An old Rand wick (N.S.W.) identity passed
away last week in Mrs. George Donnelly. For a number
of years she was known to sportsmen as the landlady of
the Halfway House, Randwick, now the A.J.O. Hotel.
Her first husband was Johnny Cutts, who rode the winner
in the first and second Melbourne Cups, 1861-62. When
Johnny died, the widow married Johnny’s successor in De
Mestre’s employment—the crack rider, George Donnelly.
She survived both husbands.

How handieappers differ concerning the capa-

for recent Mentone and Sandown (Vic.) Handicaps.
Sandown weights showed 121bs. between Godwin and
War Chief, while the margin for Mentone is 251bs. ; yet
the journey is the same (1 mile).
Of £1907 prize money given at V.R.C. meeting

from Adelaide Racing Club’s prize bag (£4125) was

Under the new system of time-keeping intro-
duced in European motor-car trials, one-fifth of a second
becomes a clumsy division of time. The “ Mors ”
method of electric chronometrage (is that the right
word ?) gets down to the hundredth part of a second. It
was given a thorough trial at the Nice races in April, and
is said to have stood all possible tests.

The Stock Exchange “ walk ” is the latest craze
in Australia—a silly kind of pedestrianism, following
closely in the wake of the London 1 took Exchange
50-mile tramp. For all that, if it doesn’t cause a few
fatalities, it should tend to put a more aesthetic appear-
ance on the pot-bellied ’changers.

Ex-world’s champion billiardist, H. W. Steven-
son, opens in Melbourne coming Monday. Four days
before leaving “ down under ” he lost supremacy to previ-
ous holder, Chas. Dawson, from whom it was wrested
and held 21 months. Stevenson won by a margin of
2594 in 9000, and lost by 300.

The programme for the annual meeting of the
National Rifle Association (Sydney), in October, is full of
alterations as compared with last year. Foremost is the
decision to exclusively adopt the Bisley-sized target—
which, in reality, means a huge reduction in the size of
the bull’s eye at all ranges. From a first-class shootist’s
standpoint this is a much-desired improvement; but the
average second-rater, who is mostly after the stray prize-
money, will find .the conditions exacting. As an .instance
of the bull’s-eye .diminution, it maybe noted that the
36in. “bull” at 700 yards of previous years will be reduced
to 20in.; and the competitor who succeeds in putting up
a possible at this distance will want something more than
“ luck."

N.S.W. Rowing Association is in a quandary
as to whether “ manual laborers ” shall be admitted to
the Association as full-blown “amateurs.” For a con-
siderable time the “tone.y ” class has held a monopoly in
amateurism, and any motion to allow the ordinary
person into the ranks is met with great hostility. The
“amateur” portion of athletics in Australasia is just
about as nauseous as ’tis possible to imagine, and a few
more years of “ class ” amateurism will about wipe out
that branch of sport.
* * * *
Talked-of Towns-Tressider match still hangs
fire —nothing definite can be got from the champion.
“ The least Towns can do is to fix some date, supposing
it is not until October or November, to meet and sign
articles. That, at least, would give general satisfaction,”
says Tressider ; but, beyond stating that he will row and
it is no use fixing a definite time till his business is
properly under way, Towns’ intentions are still known
only to himself. So the other stands idly by, with good
supporters behind him, every one of whom expresses
unqualified confidence that after he and Towns do meet
there’ll be a new champion of the world.
Public complaint having been made that the
language of some Broken Hill footballers in the midst
of an exciting game wasn’t polite, the authorities took
action and a policeman was told off to prevent any
repetition of the offending expressions. The first match
under the new Social Purity rules had interesting points.
The policeman stood in the centre of the playing ground.
The players didn’t swear, but a good deal of play centred
around the constable. Player after player bumped him,
apologising most sweetly. They also called to one
another like this: “ Here I am, William dear,” “ Pusher,
dear comrade, pass the ball to me,” “ Run, Carrots, run,
there’s a good chap.” The audience was too flabbergasted
to barrack with any vim, and when the match was over
the usually leather-lunged onlookers were content to
drive home singing hymns. It was altogether a nice,
clean match, though it wasn’t football as the game is
understood at the Hill.

Features of Victorian football up-to-date are
the “ surprising reversals,” usually charged to the
machinations of Ikey Mo ; and the unexpected revival of
Carlton. Latter has been at, or near, the bottom of the
premiership list since ’9O or thereabouts. Last year it
looked up, and this year—thanks to the accession of new
blood from Geelong and elsewhere, but chiefly to the
coaching of ex-skipper Johnny Worrall —it was undefeated
up to June Bth, when it succumbed to the prevailing
“ unaccountable reversal ” epidemic and went under to
Melbourne, which thus scored its first win for the season.
At present Fitzroy is at the top of the list, but it may be
at the bottom before the season closes. Carlton has
beaten ’Roy and has gone down to Melbourne, now
bottom. “Saints” have defeated “ Sowth,” and latter
has walloped once-mighty Essendon ; yet, if play counts
for anything, latter should still hoist this year’s pennant.

The gentle football barracker tough ! Con-
clusion of Richmond-Brunswick match, at Brunswick
(V.) Saturday, saw a pack of these wild beasts bombard
the visitors with blue metal till they escaped in cabs.
Captain (Alex. Edwards) was badly cut about the head
and face by a stone that crashed through the vehicle he
sat in. Week before, Newtown-Balmain (Sydney) match
on latter’s ground was disgraced b3 T something similar,
but set was against one man (a Newtown player) disquali-
fied for rough methods; he was hustled and belabored
till his side left the field and came to the rescue, when a
free fight ensued. For some minutes subsequent to the
appearance of the police a serious riot threatened. Ulti-
mately the victim was safely escorted to the tram—a
hooting, jeering throng of 2000 (mostly Balmain bar-
rackers) following.
W. R. George, the “father ” of amateur cycling
in N.S.W., holds a record through having occupied the
position of president of Sydney Bicycle Club for 23 years.
He and Arthur Crane started the Sydney Club in 1880,
and subsequently, with late James Martin, originated
the N.S.W. Cyclists’ Union. As a consequence, Sydney
bikists recently gave him a “ royal ” send-off, ere a
departure to view the sights o’ Lunnon Town.

N.S.W. Bike League situation gets more in-
teresting and noisier every day. Monday night 59
attended a special general meeting, and waited some
for secretary Branagan, who had been arrested during
the afternoon for alleged “forcible entering into the
League room and removing therefrom furniture and.
other property belonging to the members.” Branagan’s
appearance was cheered. The protest of MTntosh
(elected in Branagan’s place by ignored council) that •
“this meeting is illegal ” was over-ruled. Then the 59-
got down to business. Original council was incontinently
bundled out through their seats being declared vacant,
and a decision arrived at that an executive committee of
14 he appointed to carry on the business of the league
pro tern. Branagan’s action in taking possession of the
League’s property was endorsed, and authority given for
the raising of subscriptions to defend him if necessary.
It transpired that original council had withdrawn all the
League’s money from the bank, and left the new execu-
tive with an absolutely depleted treasury, but an assur-
ance came from the holders of the coin that not a penny
had been spent since the trouble over Branagan began,
and the amount was still intact.

World's amateur 3-miles running recovd was
broken recently by English carpenter Shrubb, who
got through the task in 14.17 3-5. Same man
finished within 35secs. of W. G. George’s world’s 10-mile
best, in English championships early last month ; and
last Autumn the 4-miles record went down to him. That
Shrubb had a good chance of creating fresh figures for
3 miles was abundantly evidenced in his attempt on
those for 10 miles —he covered the half distance, 5m., in
25 13 4-5, the speediest performance ever accomplished
for the first half of a 10-mile race. Fastest amateur
3-miles prior to Shrubb’s was S. Thomas’ 14.24, put up in
1892. Professional top-notch time is P. Cannon’s 14.19 L
at-Glasgow, in 1888, but this hasn’t the impress of
genuineness usually associated with records.

Marvellous club manipulating crank Tom Bur-
rows had an endurance swinging match with another
Australian at Capetown (May 12), and waved the imple-
ments continuously for 40hrs. lOmins., thus eclipsing
world’s record of 40 hours created by Maorilander Bax
and Australian Griffiths at Newcastle six years ago. Aus-
tralians are unique at this game. Athletic history has
no mention of any other country producing an endurance
club-swinger capable of getting any way near the Bur-
rows-Bax-Griffiths achievements ; Englishman Lawton’*
25 hours is the nearest.

Hargreave, Warner’s lefthanded bowler, made
a sensational return to England. His county, Warwick-
shire, had apparently to do without him against Surrey,
hut rain prevented anyplay on the first day of the match.
By the second morning, Hargreave, hurrying across from
Marseilles, was in London, and going straight to the Oval
was included in the team. He took 6 wickets for 41 and
9 for 35 ! Warwick won easily, in about a day and a half
of actual play.

A strong effort is being made to revive boxing
in Adelaide, where it has been practically dead for years.
Jim Hiscutt, who had Cocker Tweedie beaten in Sydney
when the police interfered, four months ago, met him
again, on Birthday Cup night, in a “ converted ” Salvarmy
barracks, packed to the roof with a 10s., 4s. and 2s. crowd.
Hiscutt, probably remembering the early rounds at their
former meeting, went for a knock-out from the jump,
and Tweedie’s superior science was of no use. The whole
affair only lasted a round and a half, and in that time
Cocker was on the floor for 9,8, 4 and 3 secs, before
giving in to the mighty blows of the Barrier individual.
Fred Evans, a local man, has challenged the winner, who
fought at 9st. 41b.

Inter-State lightweights Palmer (Melbourne)
and Blackmore (Sydney) put up a two minutes scrap at
Sydney National S.C. last week. Blackmore got a weighty
left hook home early, and Palmer, badly scared, kept
falling down every time danger threatened till a right on
the ear provided an excuse for remaining there. Referee
M’Donald called it “ no fight” and declared all bets off,
which is the best way of dealing with anything having a
suspicious flavor, and the only remedy for “schlenter”
matches. Palmer certainly got it hard the first time,
but afterwards never made the slightest attempt to fight.
Not likely that Palmer will ever have another chance in
Sydney, which is a pity, for he is unquestionably a clever
boxer and a hard hitter too.

Concerning Australian heavyweight pugs -and
their bruisings. Champion McCall accepted telegraphed
offer from Queenstown (Tas.) of £2OO purse and £2OO side
bet to fight James and considered match arranged. A
subsequent letter from supposed purse-giver told that
James wouldn’t fight for less than £250 or the gate, and
suggested McCall should go for the latter. The New
Englander, however, wishing to know what was to
come to him, refused ; then Sydney National S.C. came
albng with £225 aud £2O exs. for James. Later, Queens-
town promoter wired “ £2OO offer still good ” but as he
went back on his first undertaking McCall considered
that agreement off and now says he’ll fight in Sydney or
nowhere. James’ alleged refusal to fight for £2OO in face
of the fact that the wire originally received by McCall
said James would meet him for £lOO purse is peculiar.
Strong likelihood of Sydney pugs, George Johns
and Jack Blackmore, being matched. Blackmore, one of
the cleverest in Australia to-day, promises to clinch after
meeting Victorian champion light-weight, Williams, three
weeks hence. Johns will have difficulty in getting to
weight (lOst.) insisted upon by Blackmore, but he is full
of sand. The exact quantity of sand in Blackmore is
unknown, but a fight with Johns will, no doubt, make it
visible. Tivoli Rickards talks of taking Blackmore to
England ; same man talked in the old days of taking
Griffo, Jack Fuller and co. there, but they never went.

Boy fighter Bob Turner (just over 20), Aus-
tralia’s lightweight champion, just home from Westralia,
has posted £5O for another match with Jack M'Gowan
or “Micko” Walsh, or both. Failing business, he pur-
poses re-visiting Kalgoorlie to fight Jack Cullen, or may
be induced to stay and face winner of second Hegarty-
Jessop contest at Sydney National S.C. next Tuesday
night.

Second match ’tween Billy M‘Carthy (M.L.)
and Harry Phillips (Q.), at Sydney Gaiety A.C., last
week, resembled that at Adelaide. M'Carthy evaded
always, while Phillips was furiously, but as a rule fruit-
lessly, aggressive till the second round, when he sent
Mac. to the floor for nine seconds with a weighty right
on the jaw. M'Carthy stood up, rattled, and was soon
spread-eagled again, but spunk of a rare order, with the
help of the ring ropes, enabled him to struggle to his
feet in a stooping position. Phillips ladled it out hot
till “corners.” M'Carthy was still dazed in the third
clash, and clever footwork alone kept him on deck.
Each held t’other with his left and drove the right in
frequently and forcibly. Getting away from “holts,”
M'Carthy jolted a short arm right and, quicker than a
flash, Phillips was sent limp against the referee, and thud
to the boards, “ outed ” beyond question. It was a rare
stroke of luck for M'Carthy, who couldn’t have stayed
much longer and was in very poor “fix” as compared
with his stronger opponent.

Bruisers Lyn Truscott and Alf. Yercoe
(brother of ex-middleweight champion “Soldier” Thomp-
son) roughed through a scuffling, clinching scrap at
Sydney National S.C., Monday night. Yercoe began
dazed and weary-looking, and never brightened once.
Though in excellent condition Truscott did nothing but
shove Vercoe’s head back with left pushes—they were
not hits. Had half of them been hits the scramble would
have quickly ended. Vereoe couldn’t punch hard enough
to make the slightest impression, and (when the towel
went up from his corner in the 15th roiind) while both
Vercoe’s cheek bones were grazed and he bled from the
teeth, there wasn’t a mark on Truscott, nor did he seem
to have turned a hair. As a bdxing contest the thing
was poor indeed though genuine enough ; yet it appar-
ently excited some.

Cabled, Sunday, from Wellington (M.L.), that
one-time top-notch ’rastler, Harry Dunn, was found dead
in a hut at the Globe mine," Reefton —“he had been
drinking heavily.” Dunn worked in Reefton mines for
past few years—mining was his calling. Inside 20 years
back he was first heard of as a ’rastler, and competed
successfully during the big Australian boom of that
period, when world’s champion, Tom Cannon, Donald
Dinnie, Prof. Miller, Jack Connors, Sali, and others were
up to their eyes in the game. Later, Dunn went to
America, and met with varying fortune, but was never
defeated at his own style—Cumberland. In Sydney,
since his return, he faced Lucifer at the Lyceum in a
Greeeo-Roman match, which Dunn won. While compet-
ing (Cornish style) at Hibernian Society’s St. Patrick's
Day Sports subsequently, Dunn, quite unprepared for a
surprise, went under to strong man Pagel, then un-
known (who entered as “Williams”). Dunn collapsed
mainly through utter lack of condition, for Pagel knew
little or nothing about the game, and relied solely on his
great strength.

“ Bob R.” : Don’t know much about city racing,
but I guess the country owner could give even “ the
ponies” a point. Went to a race meeting in a Southern
town t’other day. First race —six started. Two jocks
had dummy spurs on ; one horse carried shoes heavy
enough to make a buggy tyre ; another horse “ bolted ” ;
whilst a jock at the run-home was lucky enough to have
a strong bridle ! The favorite won because he couldn’t
walk slow enough to lose without falling down. Another
race —three starters. One was left at the post; the out-
sider won by three lengths ; protest entered by the owner
of second horse on grounds of interference (presumably
the first horse had put its tail in the second one’s eye).
Stewards met (they had backed the second moke) and
upheld the protest ; also, in their indignation at nearly
losing their money, disqualified the rider of the first horse
for six months. Last race was run in a canter ; the whole
lot were “ dead ” ; and the corpse that won was the most
disgusted-looking deader imaginable
The incurable habit of leaning on the
Government ! Broken Hill, almost the richest
mining town in Australia, is bargaining with a
person who thinks he can make rain, and who
asks for £2500 if a deluge is forthcoming. And it
wants the Government to put up most of the
money. Every helpless leaner against a post in
Australia wants the Government to put up the
money.
Dr. McCarthy, the rain-inaker, says that
if he produces rain at Broken Hill and then the
slag city fails to pay up, he will not take the matter
to the law courts, but he will give the Broken Hill
people “suoh a showing up that they will he
ashamed of themselves.” But why show them
up? Why not drown them out?
Passed out at Bendigo, recently, Charles
Walters, who claimed to be the first mining
speculator in Australia. The old man, who had
reached his 83rd milestone, served an apprentice-
ship to the coachbuilding trade in Hobart, and
moved to Melbourne in 1849. When there, the
report of a gold discovery by a shepherd in the
Pyrenees attracted his attention, and he sent a
man out to explore the promised land at £1 a
week. This, he claimed, was the first money
spent in the search for gold in Australia, and thus
he was the first mining speculator. What became
of the poor devil at £1 a week isn’t known. The
world is full of poor devils at £1 a week.

VENTILATION.
“Our own breath ix our greatest enemy."
NO MORE STUFFY ROOMS OR MEPHITIC ATnOSPHERE.— A person finds a room stuffy, opens the
window, sits in a draught and pays yie penalty, and forthwith blames the fresh air. It must be admitted
that hitherto it has been a choice of evils, whether to breathe the polluted air of a room or run the risk of
cold from the draught of an open window or door. BUT ALL THIS IS NOW CHANGED.
THE PULLMAN AUTOHATIC VENTILATOR (the invention of the famous inventor and builcer of the
luxurious Pullman Railway Carriages) admits into any room equipped with it a constant supply of outside fresh air
free from dust, smoke, or wet, and ABSOLUTELY WITHOUT DRAUGHT, irrespective of weather conditions. It
gently diffuses the air and also acts as an exhaust. IT SOLVES ABSOLUTELY THE PROBLEM OF HEALTHY
VENTILATION. For sleeping apartments, offices, hospitals, lodge and smoking rooms, factories, halls, public
buildings, enclosed vehicles, schools, churches, &c., the invention is invaluable. It can be fitted to the window or
brickwork without disfiguring the original structure, and cost is so moderate as to bring the invention within reach
of the householder of most modest means. VENTILATE AND THUS REMOVE ONE OF THE PRINCIPAL

Alexander Morrison, the just deceased
Principal of the Scotch College, Melbourne, was
not cursed with a blind greed of gold. He
“ farmed ” the college, and, of course, could
employ just as large or small a staff as he pleased,
and pay as he thought fit. But “Doc” wanted
the S.C. to be the boss Victorian college, and so
the staff has always been Al. Maurice Carton,
University lecturer in French ; Ingram, classical
lecturer at Trinity College, Melb. University; and
Aiken, one of the most brilliant science Students
that Melb. University has so far produced, were
all on the S.C. staff.
The excursion by s.s. Victoria to the South Sea
Islands has been organised for the purpose of visiting a
large number of places of interest—principally mission
stations-which are not in the trading routes' Passen-
gers will fully appreciate the unique opportunity now
available for cruising 7000 miles of the Pacific on a 3000-
ton ocean yacht. The Victoria leaves Sydney on 25th
July next. The prospectus of the tour sets forth a pro-
gramme far in advance of that of any previous excursion
to the Dreamlands of Coral and Palm. Excursionists
will spend eighteen days ashore. Cardinal Moran and a
clerical party go with this excursion on a tour of inspec-
tion'of the mission stations.*
S.M. Herald describes it as “a serious
allegation ” that N.S.W. Government ispostponing
payment of accounts till the new financial year.
Of course it is serious, but every N.S.W. Ministry
has done it since Dibbs and honesty went out to-
gether. That is what Reid’s “Cash Basis” is
for. Before Reid’s time, all accounts belonging
to the year had to be charged to the year. Reid
created a system by which all accounts not paid
on 30th June are charged to next financial year,
and started by not charging till next year six
months interest on a large portion of the public
debt. That * ‘ serious allegation ” has been
allegated regularly for seven,years now.
The Tasmanians are already weeping a id
tearing their garments that they put out the mem-
bers of the last Government —Lewis, Bird and
Mulcahy—and left the youngsters now on the
Treasury Bench without an Opposition. The new
Assembly sworn in the other day is a ragged crowd.
More than one-half of the members have, per-
haps, never seen the inside of a Parliament House
before. During the one-day sitting a week or
two ago, R. C. Patterson acted “by request” as
leader of the Opposition, but what he led wasn’t
clear. All the most experienced of the last
Parliament are gone, and there’s nobody left to
defend the Lewis policy. A lot of people wanted
to see a change of Government, and to get rid of
the income-tax, but few really wished to see the
old war-horses shot as useless.

Re an interesting ancient :
Melbourne’s bard, Fitzgibbon, who, at 70, was lately
elected to his fourth term as Chairman of the Board of
Works, is, in spite of his “ White Knight ” craze and his
poems, a sturdy democrat in many ways. To an Argus
interviewer he gave interesting details of his own life*
hut kindly kept a veil over the idiosyncrasies of many of
Melbourne’s municipal identities whom he has known.
Born at Cork, the young Irishman was at Forest Creek
diggings in 52. Then became reader to Victoria’s
first Leg. Council, where he met Andrew Clarke,
Childers, Stawell, Molesworth, Faw'kner, and O’Shanassy.
Next he became Melbourne’s town clerk, Jacky Tommy
Smith was Mayor. From ’56 till the Board of Works began
sewering Melbourne the other day, he watched a long pro-
cession of municipal nobodies—whose very names are now
forgotten—pass along, and most of the time he had to
struggle against their stodgy Toryism and Parliamentary
aggression. Though he doesn’t say so, the White Knight
can have but a poor opinion of those gas-baggy old
pioneers. Fitz. wanted to municipalise gas, water
supply, hydraulic power, and other works for the public
advantage, but couldn’t heat municipal incapacity,
allied to Parliamentary jobbery. He wanted the cor-
poration to acquire as much real property as possible, so
as by-and-bye to do entirely without rates, but “No,
no,” said O’Shanassy, “You would make the corpora-
tion too independent of Parliament, and we object
to that.” Even when the council was ge ting
power to build shops, etc., on its market frontages
and had got its Bill through the Assembly, old man
Fawkner—the Fats of those days being just as dense as
to-day—blocked the Bill persistently until “ Big ” Clarke
showed him that his own property would be improved by
the council’s improvements. Fitz. also had many tough
fights for the public’s parks, ever open to the attacks of
greedy' speculators and needy Governments, and even his
vigilance and tireless protests couldn’t save them all; J.
M. Grant, when Lands Minister in the ’6o’s, gra’ bed and
sold the frontages of Roy at and Fawkner Parks, along
Sydney and St. Kilda Roads. With a less energetic,
public-spirited servant Melbourne would probably possess
few parks to-day, as the “redoubtable old pioneers”
early acquired the habit of annexing all they could lay
their hands on, and though they couldn’t get the deeds to
the land they actually carted away the best soil for their
private gardens. They' were rapacious robbers, those old
pioneers ! Also, though he couldn’t block the swindle
altogether, it was mainly owing to Fitzgibbon’s efforts
that Melbourne will own its own tramways in 1917 —tie
original Bill gave the co. the right to build the lines and
own them for all time. Altogether, Melbourne owes
Fitzgibbon more than it thinks, for he stood up for the
people’s rights w hen there was no Labor party to keep
watch on the jobs of scheming politicians and needy
speculators.
Stuck well into the middle of an Adelaide
obituary notice the other day was the announce-
ment that the dead man (a well known prospector)
“wired only a few days before his death that he
quite endorsed the high opinions expressed
about the mine.” People who have to sell
wild cats can’t afford to be particular, perhaps ;
but it looks like playing it rather low down to
use an obituary par to puff the Something-or-other
Extended.
Charles Hadin, whose prospecting mate.
George Withers, was probably the first white man
to find gold at Coolgardie, died lately on the
African Gold Coast. Withers was speared by the
Westralian blacks, and the pair had to clear.
They told Bayley and Ford that there was gold in
the Coolgardie district, and these two risked it,
getting there about 12 months after the others.
Hadin had only been a few months in Africa,
where he had been working with W. Frost,
another old Westralian battler.
Went under in Adelaide t’other week
Leeson (mostly known as ‘ Lazarus ’) Staples,
one of S.A’s. very old time licensed victuallers.
He humped the bluey over many, many miles
in the wheat State in the early days, and one
time was worth many thousands, but latterly
dropped much of this through drought. He kept
the old Kapunda Bazaar in the beginning of the
fifties, and also used to run a stall in the East
End market, Adelaide. His age was generally
understood to be something immeasurable.

“H.” on Smiths :
There is a new book on “The Smith Family.” The
author comes up exultant, with his catalogue of achieve-
ment, but you leave off with the query : Where is
Napoleon Smith ? Darwin Smith ? Scott Smith ? Dickens
Smith? Gladstone Smith ? You tap with an inquisitive
hammer all the sounding bells of Shakspeare, Homer,
Dante, Goethe, Voltaire, Balzac, Tamerlane, Confucius,
and what not, but no Smith responds. To be sure there
are Adam Smith, two Sydney Smiths, and the Rt. Hon. W.
H. Smith, M.P., Minister of War, and Head of the
Admiralty, the original Sir Joseph Porter ; but the appal-
ling opportunities of the Smith battalion otherwise do
not struggle much above the commonplace, unless—and
here the author is strangely at fault—unless the New
World of Australia is called in to redress the balance !
There, indeed, we have Spruce Myth, Jacky Tommy
Smith who went to England with a chaplain and came
back with two- donkeys, and a Melbourne journalist
Smith or two—also Pumpkin.
In Sydney, the Sunday trams are supposed
to leave off running for 90 minutes morning and
evening, in order not to disturb the services in the
handful of churches which abut directly on the
lines. But, of late, the Department has begun to
abbreviate the period of stoppage, and it looks as
if there might presently be no stoppage at all.
Wherefore the S.S. Evangelical Council has depu-
tationised the Department very seriously, and
wagged its beard at it very sternly, and asked it
where it expects to go to when it dies. The
Bulletin has a certain sneaking sympathy with
these dour old preachers. It suggests that the
stoppage be extended to 2J or even three hours each
time, and that the prohibition of traffic be ex-
tended to include ’busses, cabs, private carriages,
bikes and ferry-boats. Then the pious can hoof it
to church and hoof it home again, and the Sab-
bath will be in better repair than for a long time
past.
Monday, 25th May, was the 62nd anni-
versary of the lighting of Sydney with gas. The
same co. has held the monopoly all through.
Be the passing of Parkes, “ M ” writes :
The very last time Henry Parkes was in the city of
Sydney, I was standing about 6 p.m. at the corner of
Elizabeth and Hunter streets, when I caught sight of the
veteran limping feebly along from the direction of Parlia-
ment House. As he approached, I saw a look of unut-
terable sadness in his ghostly face, and a strange
sardonic light in his eyes. As he stood waiting for an
Annandale tram, with his eyes fixed on the ground,
and the crowd bustling around him, no one gave more
than a passing glance, and even several M’s.P. brushed
by him unheedingly. He was so lonely, so depressed
and manifestly feeble that, although not intimately
acquainted with him I felt impelled to inquire how he
was. “I am very tired,” he said —“ very weary ! Nothing
interests me now ; and I feel that Ido not care.” “ You
are not well,” I ventured. “ Physically,” he replied, “as
well as ever ! My frame is full of life, and would hold
out for years if I wished it. But I don’t ; for my mind is
tired, very tired, and I should like to let it have its long
rest.” “ You will be brighter to-morrow,” I said, “ when
you come into town and meet some old friend. “ I have
few friends,” he answered—“ fewer than almost anybody.
Those few I will meet at home, if they care to see the
last of me, but I will never come into town again. This
is my tram. Good-bye.” He held out his shrunken
hand, and I sorrowfully assisted him into the car.
BABY’S COUGH MUST NEVER LINGER.
Nothing is more distressing than to see a
helpless little infant suffering with a cough, and
to be fearful of using a remedy which may con-
tain some harmful ingredient. The makers of
Chamberlain’s Cough remedy positively guaran-
tee that this preparation does not contain opium
in any form, or any other harmful substance.
Mothers may confidently give this remedy to their
little ones. It gives prompt relief and is perfectly
safe. It always cures, and cures quickly. Is6d.*

9 Duke-street, East Balmain,
Sydney, July 11th, 1902.
Dear Sirs: My little son was trou-
bled with a very terrible cough for
about six months, and was so bad, that he
could neither eat nor sleep, and wasted away
to a mere skeleton. On trying Scott’s Emul-
sion, I found he improved from the first dose,
and liked it; it first eased his cough, then gave
him an appetite for food, restored sleep to
him, and finally built him up into feal robust
health.
About two months ago my husband had a
severe attack of pneumonia. I induced him
to try Scott’s Emulsion, and the result in his
case can best be told in the words of the doctor
who attended him. He said : “He had never
in his experience as a medical man, seen a pa-
tient who was so bad get on so well and so
quickly.”
Faithfully yours,
(Signed) Mrs. Emma Pattinson.

IS LIFE EASIER RIGHT, OR
WRONG ? Of course there is but one
answer to the question, and if you are a true
Australian you are doing your best to put
right what is wrong, especially if there is
illness in the house. Now the way to put it
right is by taking Scott’s Emulsion. One
who has seen the cure performed has just told
you so. We do not propose to dwell on the
Symptoms of childhood’s troubles; they are
known to every mother; and every mother
.seeking the right remedy sends at once for
Scott’s Emulsion. That is the only thing
you wish to know from us: the name of the
remedy—it is
SCOTT'S EMULSION* Cut short
your child’s suffering ; restore sleep, appetite,
health and roses to its cheeks, the process is
so easy by the use of Scott’s Emulsion. It has
cured everywhere else in the world and will
cure here. You have one precaution only to
take ; and that is to see that on the wrapper
of the bottle there is a picture of a man carry-
ing a big cod-fish ; if that cod-fish is not there,
you are not getting what we promise you—a
cure ! You can obtain a sample of Scott’s
Emulsion and the choicest children’s booklet
of the year, “ A Bunch of Roses,"’ beautifully
printed in colors, by sending sd. to Scott &

A DRUBBING ACHE
•• : : . Yf.\c,
OF THE BACK
kidneys are not doing their work properly.
DISEASE
is to place some urine, passed the first thing in the morning, in a covered glass and let it stand until
the next morning. If it is then cloudy, shows a sediment like brick-dust, if particles float about in
it, or it is of an unnatural color, then your kidneys are affected, and no time must be lost in taking
measures to restore them to health and activity, or you will soon begin to feel the effects by suffering
from Bright's Disease, Diabetes, or some less serious but more painful complaint.
Rheumatism, Gout,
Lumbago, Sciatica, Ansemia, Debility, Neuralgia, Digestive Troubles, Stone,
Gravel, Bladder Disorders, "all arise from defective action of the kidneys or retention of
URIC ACID
in the system, owing to this defective action.
The Kidneys. —lt is the province of the kidneys to separate from the blood, surplus water and
urinary impurities. The kidneys of the average person filter and extract from the blood about three
pints of water in twenty-four hours. In this quantity of water should be dissolved about an ounce
of urea, ten to twelve grains, in weight, of uric acid, together with other animal and mineral matter
varying from a third of an ounce to nearly an ounce. If the kidneys, through weakness or disease,
are incapable of extracting this solid matter, a certain proportion of it remains in the system, acts as
a specific poison, and produces one or more of the diseases named.
Warner’s Safe Cure
is the only known medicine which possesses the power to cure all disorders of the
KIDNEYS AND LIVER
and all complaints arising from the inability of those vital organs to remove from the system urinary
and biliary poisons. This is the reason that Warner’s Safe Cure cures so many complaints of
seemingly diverse origin. Warner’s Safe Cure cures Rheumatism, Gout, Backache, Lumbago,
Sciat.ca, Persistent Headache, Neuralgia, Gx’avel, Stone, Bladder Troubles,
Ansemia, Debility, Indigestion, Jaundice, Torpid Liver, simply because it restores the
kidneys and liver to vigorous health and enables them to cast out the urinary and biliary poisons
which produce the diseases. So potent is Warner’s Safe Cure that it will even cure Bright’s Disease
of the kidneys, prohnbly the most fatal of all diseases flesh is heir to —a disease even more insidious
than Consumption.
Mrs. Margaret McMillan, of 9 Bendigo-street, Collingwood, Vic., says:—“My mother was a
martyr to dropsy and gravel complaint. Her arms, body and legs were swollen to an alarming degree.
She had severe pains all over the body, her water being greatly discoloured. She was under the
treatment of several doctors without deriving any benefit; in fact she was getting weaker and worse
every day. The doctors then decided that she would have to undergo an operation to get the water
away and reduce the swelling. Before allowing this to be done, we determined to give her a course
of Warner’s Safe Cure. The effect of this medicine was soon noticeable. The swelling gradually
disappeared, and she began to improve in health and strength until she was finally cured. She has
had no return of the complaint since.”
Do not despair or be cast down. You may have suffered for years and given up all hope of
recovery, but until you have taken a course of Warner’s Safe Cure despondency is quite unwarranted.
A treatise, containing full particulars relating to Warner’s Safe Cure and accounts of many
remarkable cures, will be sent free on application to H. H. Warner and Co., Limited, Australasian

feature of Australian communities is their
necessity for periodical bursts. It doesn’t matter
what direction the bursts take so long as they are
ursts. Australia feels that way now. In
Victoria the burst has actually started, and they
fire pleased to call it “reform ” over there. The
spectacle of an alleged “reform” Ministry being
a lowed to cut into old age pensions, hospital and
charity votes, to tax incomes of £125 per annum
and let the wealthy landowners of Melbourne and
other cities go scot free with hundreds of thou-
sands of pounds worth of property, is only
explainable by the fact that the State is on
the burst. And what a burst it must be
when the same gang is allowed to take
active steps to suspend Habeas Corpus Act, and
arive the capitalistic motor car through Magna
h'Auu , and ar “ & an ? s of University pushites
with batons and special permits to bludgeon in-
otiensive citizens who happened to linger near a
railway-station ! N.S.W. has not started its burst
yet, but it s getting that way. It’s like the recur-
rent boozer in a Woolloomooloo boarding-house
who keeps on making spasmodic trips to the
corner pub., returning to stand round the hall and
he stairs with a glittering eye discussing public
finance, the foundations of belief, or original sin.
±he recurrent boozer will always get on the tear
sooner or later, but if there are a few other dis-
reputable boarders egging him on in the hope of
getting a few free drinks he gets there all
the sooner; and the four Sydney dailies are
mu ,*?, P° sltlon of those disreputable boarders.
1 heyll ha,ve N.S.W. on a howling tear very
shortly without doubt, and shouting reform
as it rushes down the track that leads to sweating
civil servants, murdering the sick poor in hos-
pitals, and robbing the aged and causing untold
misery for little or no gain. The Labor and
.Progressive parties should start an energetic
propaganda, so that when N.S.W. does howl
down some track or other it may be the one that
leads to graduated land tax, absentee tax,
compulsory resumption of big estates for closer
settlement along the rich, well-watered coast-
line ; and the abolition of borrowing. Every
man has the feeling some time or other that
he must either rush out and kill somebody or
else found a great charitable institution. It is
the question of directing the feeling the right or
the wrong way which marks the difference
between a Ballance and a Bent.
The Enfranchised Woman.
Constance Clyde on the woman voter
In respect to politics the man voter has 99 pitfalls to
fall into ; the woman, 999 ; and the men who are educat-
ing her to use her right are responsible for most of them.
She needs, first of all, to avoid the individual who harries
her to vote for “ clean men,” and she isn’t, unfortunately,
avoiding him. At a recent small female meeting one
woman (out of 30 or so) expressed doubts as to the
alleged cleanness of some Parliamentary person whom
they wanted to do some political “chores” for them,
whereupon the majority withdrew their votes, as
they considered that whoever was their knight
should not have a breath upon his name, and
also that his escutcheon should be stainless and
his crested plume something not to be sneezed at. The
Franchise lady who wears her hat over her corrugated
countenance feels herself a political St. Elizabeth in these
days, which fact is going to play into the hands of the
politicians with the chaste white foreheads. After the ro-
mantic voteress comes the “earnestwoman.” Lotsof “earn-
est women ” (Protectionists) with the University brand on
them have informed me that if it comes to choosing
between the Freetrader, who will raise the consenting
age, and the Protectionist, who isn’t interested in the dole-
ful subject, they will choose the George REiD-ite ; which
show's a deplorable deficiency in their sense of propor-
tion. Because, if Protection gives the consenting ladv
(or her father) good employment, she may not be so
ready to consent as formerly; and even if ‘she is, it is
a hard, irreligious truth that the girl who consents and
gets employment afterwards is better off than the non-
consenting girl who has no work and no adequate means
of support. When a country girl gets good work and
wages she soon settles down to being as moral as she,is
able to be.
Many women are Protectionists or Freetraders accord-
ing to the size or sex of their families. The mother of
young children looks at her drought-smitten breakfast
table, and when the butter won’t go round talks bitterly
of Barton. Mrs. Smith, with two sons in factories and
another coming on for factory life, is a Protectionist;
but Mrs. Jones, whose daughters earn no wages, is a
Freetrader, because “if the girls’ clothes aren’t dearer
already they soon will be.” The only way for the Govern-
ment to convert her to common sense, is to supply her
with three wage-earning sons-in-law in double-quick
time. The maiden lady of uncertain age is sometimes a
Freetrader, because she considers boys should “ settle on
the land and rough it; it makes men of them.” It is
always other people’s sons that we W'ant to make men of
by turning them as near to the brute creation as possible.
The only way to convert this severe person is to get
her a husband—and Government will find that a tough
business.

One of the Maoriland M.H.R.’s elected last
November is T. E. Taylor, who is worth watch-
ing, and who stirred up things pretty considerably
when he was in the House before. He is Seddon’s
pet horror, and keeps that worthy old person in a
constant flutter. At a banquet in Christchurch
the other day, after nearly everyone had got off
a load of flattery of Chamberlain, Taylor got up
and paralysed things in this style :
The questions dealt with by Mr. Chamberlain would
have to be discussed pretty thoroughly within the next
year or two, but he rather shrank from endorsing all
those things proposed in the name of Imperialism.
There was no instance recorded where an empire had
accomplished a great deed ; there were heaps of instances
where a small people had accomplished mighty things.
If, while he was in the House, the matter came up for
actual settlement, he would not discount the employ-
ment, the education, and the comfort enjoyed by the
working men of the country one per cent, for the
sake of the Empire. (Hear, hear.) The Maoriland
Parliament could render a more signal service to
the race they belonged to by conserving the rights
of the people, and setting an example to the Old
Land. He wanted to know what this Imperialism meant.
Did it mean that an English institution like the House
of Lords was to be allowed to put a finger on the affairs
of the colony ? If an empire had to give a House of
Lords, let us go out of the partnership altogether.
(Applause.) He loved his country, but he would not tie
round the necks of the people the problems that the
apathy of the English people had created in the Old
Land. So far as he was personally concerned, he would
be very sceptical of arguments that were based on pure
sentiment. The people should watch with the greatest
care any proposition such as had been made by Mr.
Chamberlain. He failed himself to see why we should
do anything in the way of Imperial trade that was going
to injure our people for the benefit of the British manu-
facturer.

A Melbourne pressman writes :
The Ballarat legislator has to be a wily bird. For years
that Sabbatarian centre has been represented in Vic.
Parliament by pious and teetotal politicians. I once met
a Ballarat member at Parliament House, and we had
drinks, the politician’s being gin and lithia, reiterated
several times. After that we caught the train for the
golden city. When we got out to refresh at Bacchus
Marsh, the member drank soda straight. At Ballarat, I
again suggested drinks. A horrified expression crept
over the legislator’s phiz, and he loudly remarked “My
dear fellow, I never touch it,” —then in a whisper,
“Leastways, not in Ballarat.” Verily, the Ballarat
member must not let his left hand know that which his
right hand lifteth.

Nellie Stewart 19 offered a tempting American engage-
ment for her Nell Gwynne. It goes without saying that
“Sweet Nell,” the work of an American author, has been
played everywhere in the States, and the Australian
arti9t i 9 everywhere spoken of as the star performer of
the name part. This country has produced a famous
actress.
Melbourne’s Daily Syme begins to show a fine Tory
regard for class distinctions. Even the theatrical critic
reveals it in his notice of “ Breaking the Drought,” when
he says : “ Mr, Styan gave a capital character study—not
of a typical squatter, but of what would be described in
the back-blocks as a ‘ bush cocky.’ The average squatter
is generally a man of some education, and some experi-
ence of city life, but as represented in the play he is an
unsophisticated bushman to whom champagne is a perfect
novelty.” Squattahs must not be libelled in this way.
David Syme himself is among the wealthiest of the elect.
Notable how “clean” American novels and American
plays are, compared with the average European produc-
tions. This is particularly noticeable in farces ; most
English, French and German farces hinge on some hus-
band or wife having, or wishing to have, a night off the
matrimonial chain ; the American farce makes the com-
plication spring from a man’s desire to go to a prize-fight,
or some other comparatively harmless amusement.
Silvery tenor C. Rose is about the unluckiest vocalist
in Australia. He had just succeeded in arranging a
series of dramatic performances in Prahran Town Hall,
when he fell dangerously ill.
Herr Plock, who died recently at the age of 79, never
discarded the typical stage German accent, which he
interlarded with Yiddish. Twenty years ago he was worth
£lOO,OOO, but lost every penny of it in Matthew Davies’
banks.
Roland Cunningham, brother of Arcus Cunningham,
“ created ” the tenor part in a new comic opera at one of
the London suburban theatres. Cunningham scored
heavily, but the opera, a perversion of Audran’s “La
Toledal,” was killed by the dull libretto.
Robert Courtneidge, who came out to stage the elabor-
ate productions of “Midsummer Night’s Dream” and
“As You Like It” for Musgrove, is now journeying back
to via America, with his wife and smart little
daughter, Cicely. Courtneidge may return to Australia
one of these years, but for the present he has some
speculations brewing on the other side, and, having
made a big mark as manager of the syndicated theatres
at Manchester, he is likely to get fixed at the Big Smoke.
Scholarly artist and indefatigable man of business are
combined in Courtneidge's nervous, unassuming per-
sonality. Whatever he does is done for all it is worth.
Amusing to note the wrath of Melbourne’s musical
cranks and critics on discovering that Mark Hambourg
couldn’t give his bank-holiday concert at the Town Hall
because Nap. Boffard had hired it for the occasion with
no intention of using it. Ze great Napoleon’s policy was
quite legitimate. He was running a popular concert at the
Exhibition Biiilding on the same night, and didn’t want
any opposition at the Town Hall. And how wise and
bold a speculator the gaudy stout gentleman would have
looked in the event of the Exhibition Building getting
burned down before his concert fell due !
Maurice Grau, just retired through physical breakdown
from running grand opera enterprise in New York, says
he has been so successful because he treated opera as a
"commercial proposition.” Grau says he is no musical
critic, has never “ discovered a voice,” and wouldn’t
know one if he heard it.
“ F.” : No doubt (according to 8., 6/6/’O3) Snazelle
is a bit short; but I reckon that a three months’ course of
running lantern views would spoil the best of tempers.
I saw Snazzy several times, and never saw an evening got
through altogether smoothly. Worst experience was in
a big Vic. provincial town, when the man that managed
the views mixed things up from the jump. Snazzy stood
it well, even when the picture of a blacksmith appeared
as an illustration of “The mill wheel,” which Snazelle
was singing. At last the fiend with the lantern put in a
waterfall upside dawn, and Snazelle exploded. He began
by being laboriously sarcastic, saying that the waterfall
might have been upset lately. Then he stood off the
slide manipulator and cursed him vigorously. The very
next picture had a fly, magnified till it looked like a
winged alligator, walking over it. The fly had sneaked
in at the lantern man’s end. Snazelle let go again.
After that the lantern man got flurried and everything
was upside down or sideways, and Snazelle let himself go
wholesale. It wag a great night.
A London weekly recently offered three prizes for the
three ladies who were voted to be the prettiest per
formers then showing at the London and provincial-
theatres. Miss Kitty Rayburn, of the Britannia Theatre,
Hoxton, topped the poll with 6972 votes ; Miss Dorothy
Frostick, of Liverpool, being a good second, and Miss
Daisy Jerome, Manchester, a fair third. Marie Lloyd was
19th on the list (Great Jupiter!), Ada Reeve 22nd, and
Grace Palotta B6th, with a paltry 316 votes ! The three
prize-winners were playing panto, boys’ parts, and by
leaving much of their beauty unadorned they scooped
the sympathy ef the public. But a public which could
give one vote to Marie Lloyd for “ prettiness ” is such an
ass as not to be worth considering.
Charles Mathews, when making a speech from the
stage, was considered peculiarly happy in his impromptu
replies to interjections. The press people were a shade
less enthusiastic, because the comedian always handed
them in advance his written address, containing inter-
jections as well as replies. Mathews kept his own stipen-
diary interjectors on the premises.
Old-time “Mikado” executioner, Jimmy South, now
finds sanctuary in Queensland’s old-age retreat, Dunwich.
He took part in a stirring drama performed for the
amusement of the inmates, on Easter Monday, and was
much applauded by his co-fogies.
Re ft defunct publican :
Every shilling bequeathed to Melbourne charities by
the late Charley Wright was fairly owing to them, and
a long time overdue. “ Charley ’’ touched the age of 81,
and the period of his night-house glories was way back in
the dim past when Bourke-street, Melbourne, ranked as
a h 1 of a thoroughfare, and Wright’s "Coliseum”
and “Canterbury” were the hottest of licensed liquor
and loose-leg shops. Wright dedicated £lOOO to the
Foundling Hospital that has yet to come to pass—a most
appropriatf bequest; £3OOO in trust for Melbourne Hos-
pital ; £2OOO for the Alfred Hospital, and £lOOO to be
invested for the benefit of the poor-boxes at four Mel-
bourne courts of petty sessions. All of his £30,000 estate,
bar some £2OOO, goes to charities. The will directs an
expenditure of £5O for a tombstone, and £6O for a
memorial window in a church. A memorial window to
Charley Wright! Shades of the departed who drank,
danced, ai£d wasted at the Coliseum—are you listening?
The Conscienceless sweating practised by
the Bent Railways is at last becoming too much
; £or even the master-sweater —the Victorian farmer.
'jjL 1«4 of these agriculturists protested lately
ty&aihst the suspension and prospective punish-
metat of the Guildford station-master, who
overslept himself one Sunday morning and so
delayed a train. The official; who, single-handed,
runs the electric staff, goods, parcels, passenger,
stock and telegraph business for the township,
had started work on Monday at 5 a.m., and kept
straight on till Tuesday, 8 p.m. Started again
Wednesday, 5 a.m., and went straight on till
Saturday 2 a.m. Then he tried to cram a week’s
proper rest into 3 hours and slept in. He should
have been awake, and on duty'again at 5 a.m.,
and he wasn’t. He was only in bed twice, and
had but 14 hours off duty in the whole 6 days.
The local agriculturists only ask that his offence
in not being on duty again and fully awake at
5 a.m. should be overlooked. They don’t ask the
punishment of the heartless savage—whether it
is Bent or any other savage—who caused this
hideous state of things. In fact, they are very
moderate agriculturists indeed.
N.S.W. Opposition leader Joseph had a
dinner party on the eve of the Session opening,
and in an atmosphere of thick grease his sup-
porters larded him, and he larded himself and his
supporters. And there was a cannibal glare in
every eye. Solemn Lee looked at Joseph hun-
grily while he larded him, and Ashton seemed
to be guessing at Joseph’s weight as he wielded
the rich grease-mop. The guests who were
not Ms.P. looked ravenously at the guests
who were, and you couldn’t help imagining them
scrunching one another’s bones. Jt was the
hungriest-looking festivity possible, ‘ aiid even
after much meat had been eaten and much
whisky consumed, there was still the impression
of an aching void everywhere, and, going home, as
much envious scandal was talked as after a
mothers’ meeting.
Sydney D.T. again on the iniquity of
making an importer explain a prima facie cronk
invoice to a magistrate in court:
Where intention, or gross carelessness, can be shown,
it is right that there should be a prosecution, but, in
other cases, we make a suggestion, etc.
Now who , if not the magistrate, is to determine,
and where, if not in court, should it be decided, what
is intention and what is gross carelessness? Is it
the Minister in his private office ? Is it one of his
officers in a private office ? No doubt there would
be no objection to either of these, so long as the
importer was let off ; but if fined heavily lie would
yell “ star chamber,” and if sent for trial he would
mourn about having his case prejudged. When
the customs were in State hands there was a good
deal of this quiet settling-up of questionable
invoices before a private officer in a private office,
and the suspicion of bribery, influence, and palm-
grease was over it all.
Thus his Honor, quoting a ease in N.S.W.
Divorce Court: “ The husband agreed to return
to her if in the meantime she acquired the accom-
plishments of piano, reading, writing and deport-
ment ; but it appeared she did not acquire these,
and gave birth to a child, to which he contributed
2s. 6d. a week.”
Melbourne Bard of Works Fitzgibbon ex-
plained, the other day, that he was moved by
Heaven to apply for the chairmanship of the
Board of Works, at £2OOO a year, when he was
getting £l5OO a year from the City Council.
When Town Clerk Fitz was first implored
To seek a fatter billet,
Thought he, “ I’ll go and ask the Lord
If I am meant to fill it.”
He went to church, with mind at ease
And there, in accents fruity,
He prayed upon his aged knees,
“ O, Ruler of the land and seas,
Instruct the parson, if You please,
To guide me to my duty.”
The preacher’s text was but a word,
The one word “ Watch ! ” (how thrilling !)
Fitzgibbon bowed his head, and heard,
And answered, “ Lord, I’m willing;
Although Thy servant’s old and gray
(Full 58 my age is),
I guess I know the time o’ day
By this Thy ‘ Watch,’ which is to say
I’ll never throw a chance away
Of making better wages.”
Then forth from church he slowly went,
And, feeling quite a martyr,
Communicated his intent
To jaunty G. D. Carter.
“ Restrain," quoth Fitz, “ your sinful smirks
I am the Lord’s anointed ;
A chosen servant rarely shirks
Two thousand pounds a year, and perks,
God calls me to the Board of Works !
He sha’n’t be disappointed ! ”

SPECIAL ATTENTION is drawn to the chapter upon Electricity and its appli-
cation to the human nerve system by the use of
The FREEMAN & WALLACE ELECTRIC “ INVIGORATOR " BELT.
This treatment is fully described and illustrated, and its uses explained. It is a genuine
electric “Belt ” as is now in use amongst English Scientists, who recognise that an even
current of medical electricity infused into the chief nerve centres governing the stomach and
kidneys is a certain relief in cases of physical “weakness and general breakdown.
THIS “INVIGORATOR ” IS SOLD FOR £1 ONLY.
It is superior to any electric instrument used in medical practice in Australia. A perusal of

“Jaybell” on some Queensland poli-
ticians :
Up to present, the last-elected Laborite in Bana-
land hasn’t done anything extraordinary in the fire-eating
line. Dawson used to emit blue-flame when the fancy
struck him in past days, likewise Higgs, but Higgs’ used
to dart farther across the House and sizzle more Minis-
terial whisker than Dawson’s. Now that both have gone,
Joe Lesina has a heavy job to keep up former traditions.
His awful habit of coming in loaded with about 4£cwt. of
documentary impedimenta, and persistently referring to
the'mound of nondescript literature as his “notes” is
rather blighting than otherwise, and makes even his
kindest friends wish that he would set a match to the
heap. If he could be prevailed upon to make a speech
in handcuffs, thus compelling him to depend solely upon
his own memory and unaided efforts, it would be among
the finest ever recorded in Hansard. The 4£cwt. of
literature blights Joe’s efforts.
Vic. Justice Hartley Williams (now re-
tired) held his first criminal brief, associated with
the late J. H. Dunne, in the prosecution of bar-
rister and journalist G. H. Supple for the murder
of Walshe, a publican of Spring and Lonsdale
streets, and an ex-detective. Supple, with a
loaded revolver, was in hot pursuit of G. P.
Smith, barrister, journalist and politician, when
Walshe, standing in his bar door, rushed between
the pair; Supple, almost blind, when grappled
with, fired or else the revolver went off. Higin-
botham, in defence, argued that the weapon ex-
ploded consequent on Walshe’s collision with
Supple, and a point was reserved built on that.
The Full Court sustained the conviction, and the
Executive said that Supple must hang, but finally
commuted the sentence.

Beanie’s Bronchitis Cure
) TUB FA.MOI7S REMEDY FOR
COUGHS, BRONCHITIS, ASTHMA, AND CONSUMPTION,
HAS THE LARGEST SALE OF ANY CHEST MEDICINE IN AUSTRALIA.
Those who have taken this medicine are amazed at its wonderful influence. Sufferers from any form of Bronchitis, Cough, Difficulty of Breathing, Hoarseness, Pain or
Soreness in the Chest, experience delightful and immediate relief; and to those who are subject to Colds on the Chest it is invaluable, as it effects a Complete Cure. It is most com-
forting in allaying irritation in the throat and giving strength to the voice, and it neither allows a Cough or Asthma to become chronic, nor Consumption to develop. Consumption has
never been known to exist where “ Coughs " have been properly treated with this medicine. No house should be without it, as, taken at the beginning, a dose is generally sufficient,
and a Complete Cure is certain.
BEWARE OF COUGHS!
REMEMBER THAT EVERY DISEASE HAS ITS COMMENCEMENT, AND CONSUMPTION IS NO EXCEPTION TO THIS RULE.

Mr. W. O. Hearne.—Dear Sir,—l am writing to tell you
about the wonderful our# your medicine has effected in
my case. About three years ago I began to cough. At
first the cough wag not severe, but it gradually got worse,
and I became very weak and troubled with night sweats,
pain in my chest, and great quantities of phlegm. On
several occasions there was blood in the expectorated
matter. I had been treated by a doctor, who pronounced
my case to be Consumption, and various other treatments
had been tried, but without benefit. It was at this stage
that I heard of your Bronchitis Cure, and sent to you for
a course of the medicine. When it arrived I was too ill to
leave my bed, but I commenced taking it at once, and
gradually improved. lam glad to say that the two lots
of medicine you sent have effected a complete cure, for
which accept my very best thanks. —Yours gratefully,
J. BLAIR.

Your letter and Bronchitis Cure to hand quite safe.
I am sure you will be glad to know that your Bronchitis
Cure has quite cured me. I was very glad when it came,
as I was suffering from a severe attack of Bronchitis at the
time it arrived. I had sent for my own doctor, but had
not had one night’s rest for a week. I started taking the
Bronchitis Cure three times a day as directed, and was
very much eased at once. At the end of a week I only
took it twice a day, and then only every night for a
week, as I was so much better when, thanks to the Lord
for adding His blessing, I was quite well, and walked into
town and back without feeling any fatigue. I had not
done that previously for 12 months—always went in the
omnibus—as walking caused me such pain and distress in
the chest. I always walk now, and never feel it, and I
am stronger than I have been for years. I thank my son
for his great kindnes* ui sending the medicine, and am,

Extract from a letter, since written by the same lady to
her son, Mr. John S. Mortimer, Llenwellyn, Katunga,
Victoria.
HER DAUGHTER HAD BEEN VERY ILL.
SPITTING UP BLOOD.
THE DOCTOR SAID NOTHING MORE GOULD BE
DONE.
CURED BY HEARNE'S BRONCHITIS CURE.
The extract runs as follows :—“ As for myself, thank
the Lord, lam feeling stronger than I have for years. I
had an attack of Bronchitis in November, but Hearne’s
Bronchitis Cure was again successful. I feel quite well,
and walk into town feeling quite strong.
“ I must ask you to send me six bottles more of the
medicine, as I wish to have a supply in the house. I
have tried to get it made up here, and let my chemist
have a bottle to see what he could do. He tells me this
week he can make nothing out of it, he never saw any-
thing like it before, so there is only one thing for me to
do—send for more. I have never kept in bed one day
since I commenced to take it. I used to be in bed a fort-
night at a time always, and after that for months I was
as weak as I could possibly be, and was always taking
cod liver oil, so you will see at once it is quite worth
while sending for it such a long distance.
“ Something more I must tell you. Charlotte has been
very ill since I wrote you. Her cough was so bad she
never had a night’s rest, and was spitting up blood
very much. The doctor told her husband that there was
nothing more he could do for her. So on the Sunday I
sent her half a bottle of the Bronchitis Cure, and told
her to try it, and if she did not use it, not to waste it,
but send it back again. She h&i such confidence in her
doctor that I thought she would not try it. On the
Wednesday I sent over again, and she was much better,
the night’s rest was very good, and cough and bleeding
from the lungs better. She sent for another half-bottle,

DISTRESSING, SUFFOCATING, DRY COUGH
ENTIRELY REMOVED BY FIVE DOSES.
NO OTHER TREATMENT COULD EVEN EASE IT.
“ Sir.—My wife was for twelve years a sufferer from
a most distressing, suffocating, dry cough that could not
be removed or even eased by any remedy, doctors’
prescriptions and patent medicines having been tried ;
but I am happy to say that the cough, pain in the chest,
and difficulty of breathing, etc., were entirely removed by
the fifth dose of your Bronchitis Cure. —I remain, Sir,

A Seven Tears’ Case.
EXPECTORATING BLOOD AND MATTER.
COMPLETELY CURED.
** Mr. W. G. Hearne.
“ Dear Sir, —Your medicine has cured me of bronchitis
and asthma, from which I suffered for upwards of seven
years, during which period I was scarcely ever free from
coughs, and frequently the difficulty of breathing was so
distressing that for nights in succession I had to sit up.
I write you this acknowledgment from a sense of duty, as
in my case every other treatment had failed. For a year
previous I had been getting very much worse, and at the
time I obtained your medicine I was confined to bed
suffering from a most violent cough, expectorating blood
and matter, and apparently beyond hope of recovery.
The first dose of the medicine gave me welcome relief,
and I steadily improved as I continued the treatment,
until I became, as I am now, quite well. —Yours sincerely,
H. WALKER, Balmain, Sydney."

17 years, and having been under a great many different
treatments without benefit, I was induced to try Hearne'*
medicine for Asthma. After taking three bottles of this
medicine I quite got rid of the Asthma, and since then
which was in the beginning of 1883 — 15 years ago—l hav
not had the slightest return of it. The medicine qui
cured me, and I have much pleasure in recommending it.

A Land of Premise.
A tale is told in England of a young man whose
ability was so small that nobody would pay him a
penny for anything he could do. There being
nothing against his character, his friends supported
him ; but with that lack of cheerfulness which
usually characterises such aid. After a few years
they wearied of the arrangement, and sent their
burden here. The night before the young man left
London, he asked some questions of a traveller
well acquainted with our country. “My friend,”
said the traveller, who was a bit of a wag, “ Aus-
tralia is the finest spot in the world. Nuggets of
pure gold may be had in abundance by merely
raking the surface of the ground, and food of every
kind is so plentiful that the people will pay you
liberally to eat it.” The young man was charmed
with the picture, and strangely enough no sooner
stepped off the steamer which brought him here
than he trod upon a purse. On finding that it
contained only £lO, he contemptuously threw it
into the water. The story ends here abruptly.
They who find, more often than not, do so only
after long seeking. Not until after she had been
treated by three doctors, and tried many medi-
cines, did Mrs. Huntley, of 65, Union Road, Ul-
timo, Sydney, N.S.W., discover that Mother
Seigel’s Curative Syrup is the one sure remedy
for biliousness. ‘‘From 19 until 23 I was
not well for a day,” writes Mrs. Huntley,
on June 19th, 1902. ' “My ailment was
chronic biliousness. Ordinary food was poison
to me, and I was obliged to exist on soda-
water, milk, plain biscuits, and dry toast. Even
that fare would sometimes distress me to an in-
tolerable degree. My skin turned sallow, my eyes
sank and were surrounded by dark hollow circles.
I slept only by fits and starts, and there was a dull,
continuous pain between my shoulders and in my
right side. Then there were frequent fits of vomit-
ing. During four years of this misery I was treated
by three doctors, and took numerous medicines;
but nothing availed me until I was induced to try
Mother Seigel’s Curative Syrup. Within a few days
of my first dose of that remedy, I began to mend,
and before a month had elapsed I could eat ordi-
nary food without fear. I continued to take it for
two months, and by the end of that time was
thoroughly restored to health. My long illness
and rapid recovery due to' Mother Seigel’s Cura-
tive Syrup excited much attention at the time in
Ultimo —where I was born, and my father before
me, and am, therefore, very well known.”*

i The A*® l “°. urn ® dailies are straining every nerve to
keep their circulations at normal since the Ballarat and
Bendigo dailies launched out to catch the western and
northern army of readers, under the motto that “ ft’s
the early paper that catches the pennies ” ! The provin
cial dailies have their city offices and staffs and theh-
literary and mechanical arrangements have been brouirht
up-to-date, particularly the latter-regardless of expense
(considering the outlook). The Argus has corresnon!
dents in the rural centres only, and as a rule only press
men connected with the local organ are appointed-
it pays one shilling for each weather report received and
eaters particularly for pastoral tastes. supples
its country corres. with addressed envelopes, stationery
and printed forms on which to keep tally of what thev
get printed—a simplified invoice-foim J On the other
hand, the Age has a representative in almost every
tin-pot hamlet in the State, pays 6d for a weather
report, and caters to suit the' cookies' palates in
regard to rural happenings. The Bendig-o press records
every blade of grass that makes its appearance between
Pannoomilloo and Carag Carag-and pays one penny a
line as against three-halfpence .paid by the Melb taffies
but many of its “ Out-Back ” scribblers are paid so much
weekly. When things look brighter, it is quite on the
boards all the dailies will reduce their literary expenses
considerably on the principle that anything sefis when
money is plentiful. Then woe to the army of unem
ployed-ahem !-country journalists who revel in beer-
money these dry times !
* * * *
And still they go ! Melb. Age has now lost four good
men since beginning of year—M Oulloch (late Evening
News, Sydney). A. Buchanan (late S M.hU), Pratt
(now of Sydney D.T.), and Bnckhill, a Tassy. So far, none
of these has been replaced, and two of the departed, at
least, wili take a, lot of beating. Only change on Argus
staff is withdrawal of F. Magona (late Adelaide ’Tiser)
through ill-health. The Age office, always a nigger-
driving shop, has lately been a perfect Gehenna for its
over-worked, and now excessively under-manned, staff,
Just at present the Age is doing a large re-shuffling of its
literary hand. G. F. H. Schuler, who for two years has
acted as editor, has been superseded, the “ Old Chief ”
Windsor, being now again in full command. Schuler was
not literary enough, though astute and, in politics (David’s
politics), perfect. During his time the Age wobbled so
badly at times that if the Argus had not been similarly
afflicted all along, that many-opticked paper might have
taken its 10-years-lost lead once more. It is a strange
coincidence that both the Oollins-st. dailies have had the
same experience with their helmsmen—Haddon, after
“ retiring," is back again, while Willoughby is definitely
done (ill-health). It seems probable that Schuler will
carry out his oft-talked-of retirement at last (he has
thousands of golden reasons therefor) and that when
Windsor, who is not anxious to carry on after all these
years, decides that his own age and David Syme’s Age
form too great a burden, that brilliant, kindly, inde-
fatigable pressman, J. S. Stephens, will occupy the chair,

It was displayed in the early days of his judgeship
when sentencing to a term of imprisonment a young
man who had abortively cut the throat of a Flossie
living at May Day Villa. She had rooked and jilted him
after the manner of her kind. Said Flossie wrote a
letter to the judge begging him to be lenient to the
man she had ruined. It was said that an Age reporter
obtained a copy of the letter (a scoop for his paper), by
passing an evening at May Day Villa, and that when
David Syme heard of this, he sacked the scribe instanter.

has lots of sympathy—the old type-slinger. His unreliabi-
lity gives him a sort of charm. His undeniable cleverness
at unexpected times, when a clean proof is a longed-for
desideratum, and the knowledge that the copy is well nigh
undecipherable is abroad, leads one to shift the blame
from his shoulders when the “ hash up ” comes. For
as he comes he goes—like a shadow and a memory—

The brilliant and lamented Dekker, of Sydney
Evening News, was a singularly tired man. Once,
when writing an article on the Australian’s sad want
of enterprise and vigor, the draught from an open
window annoyed him. Being too tired to shift, he rang
nis bell and, pointing to the window, languidly said
down” to the boy, and went on writing. As the
window was easily within the editor’s reach, the boy
didn’t quite take in the tiredness of his chief. Also,
he thought the editor said “jammed,” and informed the
foreman to that effect. Dekker was slightly amazed to see a
muscular “hand,” and two weaker men, heavily laden
with tools of the screw-jack variety, bustle into the room.
After a noisy and critical inspection the myrmidons got
their shoulders under the window, and, with a cheery
“ All together, boys 1 ” sent the frame nearly through the
roof and themselves amongst the editor and inkpots. For
a time, the den was a wilderness of astonished curses,
and the editor tacked another paragraph on his article —
about the Australian’s waste of energy this time.

. One of the best proofs of the excellence of the organisa-
tion amongst the Vic. railway men was the way in which
the Melbourne daily press was kept in absolute ignorance
as to the engine-drivers’ intentions right up to the actual
delivery of their ultimatum on May 8. That was at 9.15
a.m., and in their issues of that morning both Age and
Argus discounted the possibility of a strike, the former
distinguishing itself by printing a couple of columns of
testimony from “well-informed” sources in support of
its own vehement declaration, as set forth in a staring
headline, that a strike was out of the question. An
Argus rep., who has been since boyhood a friend of one of
the strikers’ executive, walked home with the latter
after the final meeting on the night of May 7, when the
last touches had been put to the strike campaign arrange-
ments, but in spite of persistent and more or less adroit
questioning he could not extract even a hint of an
intended strike. Another man on the same staff nearly
tumbled on to the well-kept secret through overhearing a
telephone message from a railway man in which, explain-
ing his all-night absence from home, he said “ The fat’s in
the fire”; but, through inability to follow up the clue
and obtain information, the chance was missed of making
one of the biggest “ scoops ” in Australian journalism.

The Age and Argus, the twin brethren of Shekels and

The Age got home heavily on the Argus’s imported ear,
hence this reply from the paper with the hundred green
spectacles :
“ The COMMENTS of the Age on our exposure of the
figures so carelessly adopted by the president of the
Chamber of Commerce from its columns IS characteristic
and WAS to be expected. . . The results of these move-

that THIS could have been passing under the eyes of the

AS AN INVESTMENT.
READ WHAT
AN AUTHORITY SAYS.
PEOPLE cannot understand why Diamonds do not come down m price.
Unless some new Diamond fields are discovered they will never come
down, and I think that proportionately they will go as much higher
in the next ten years as they have in the last ten years. The reason
is this • Ten years ago it took less than one-third of the effort to produce
Diamonds as it does to-day. In other words, the strata of blue ground m the
Kimberley Fields that were then worked were so prolific that Diamonds
were found practically on the top of the earth. After the very prolific strata
were worked out and it was necessary to go down a little deeper into the
earth Diamonds were not quite so plentiful, and to-day it takes at least three
times the effort to produce the same amount of stones it did ten years ago.
Pearls are also going up in value at a rapid rate.
A
UNIQUE
INVESTMENT.
AS an investment, Diamonds afford advantages offered by nothing else.
;p or years they have increased in value at about the rate of 10 per
cent, a year, which makes them as an investment about three times as
good as any bank. When you put your money in the bank someone
else has the use of it; when vou put it in Diamonds you yourself have the use
of it and the pleasure and "satisfaction of wearing Diamonds are worth as
much as the returns from the investment. This is no idle statement, written
only with the view of selling our Diamond goods, but actual facts which you
can easily prove to be correct.
We are the only Australian firm having a Warehouse in Hatton Garden,
which place, as everyone knows, is the Diamond Mart of the world. Our
long and careful study of the Stone Market has placed us in the unique posi-
tion of being able to buy more favorably than almost any firm. These
advantages are shared with our customers, while others, if they could buy as
cheaply, would probably retain them as extra profit.

DIAMONDS.
Nothing that you might select for a

able or sensible, for Diamonds—such
as we sell —increase in intrinsic worth
with age, and never deteriorate in
beauty.
Although we give particulars of the NECKLETS only we have lovely things set with Diamonds,
such as Rings, Brooches, Bracelets, Pendants, Pins, Studs, from a few pounds upwards.
It is not necessary for you to be wealthy to possess a piece of Diamond Jewellery.

artists were actually singing in my saloons. I have never heard
anything to equal it.

Joe and the Dook.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
Bill and me were sittin’ in the Half Way pub.
cooling our internals, when Bill looks out the
winder and spots Joe. Ses he: “Here comes
Joe, back from Ballarat. I s’pose he’ll come
spongin’ around for a booze.” So when Joe comes
in we were busy arguing whether Australia
should be loyal to Hingland.
I ses, It s this way. Say if Hingland gets
into a war with the Younited States ”
“He’s having a wet with Jerry, and Joe’s
payin’,” ses Bill.
As I said, sez I, “if England goes to war
with the Younited States ”
Joe s payin again, and a sovereign, too !
What ho ! Joe ! Come and settle this argument ”
ses Bill.
Joe came over. “What’s the row?” ses he.
We told him.
“Well,” ’e ses, “ let’s have a wet first. Hurry
up, Missus Public House. What’s yours’ Now
blokes, you knows I was always against Royality’
but Ira goin to arst you to drink to the health of
the Dook of York, and Gorblessim.”
We drank it, astonished like, 'an’ asked Joe
what ad happened.
“ Well,” ’e ses, “you know I finished that con-
tract of splitting in the forest, and I went down
to Ballarat with fifty-five quid nine and sixpence
all on my lonesome. I had a look about, and
after a while trots into a place they call the Ex-
change. Well, there was a lot of blokes sitting
about, so I sits down too. I saw a little parcel
tied up carefully—looked like joolery, so I edges
to it and sneaks down and picks it up. I opened
it and, straight wire, there was nothin’ in it at all.
All the blokes began larfing like a lot of kids.
The chap sittin’ next to me was quite wild, and
ses ’e, ‘ It’s a damn shame.’
“Well, him and me got talkin’, and presently
’e says ‘ Do you want to make a heap of money ’ *
ses ’e. ‘My oath,’ ses I. He whispered, ‘ Well!
buy Dook of York.’
“‘Chuck it,’ses I; ‘ where can I buy him ?He
larfed a bit, and ses ‘ You go into that orfice and
arsk him for Dook of York shares and he’ll sell
them quick enough,’ ses ’e. So off I trots and ses
‘ ’Ow many Dook of Yorks can I get for fifty
quid.’ Ses’e, ‘They’re one and three, and you
can have 800 for £5O. ’ ‘ Orlright, ’ ses I. He gets
some papers out of his iron safe and gives them to
me and I gives him my fifty quid. I got a bit
suspicious, and I ses ‘ These yours ? ’ ‘ No,’ ses ’e,
‘ Whaffor ? ’ ‘ Well, why are you sellin’ me some-
thing that doesn’t belong to yon ? ’ ses I. ‘ That’s
my bizness,’ ses he, larfin’. I was getting wet.
‘lsit ?’ ses I; ‘an’ it’s my bizness, too.’ ‘ Don’t
get oxcited, ’ -ses ’e, ‘ I sell shares for other people.’
‘ Well, trot the other people out,’ ses I. ‘Orl-
right,’ ses ’e, larfin’ like a kid, and out he trots
and brings in the very bloke wot kidded me to
buy. ‘ Oh,’ ses I, ‘ it’s ’im, is it ? That’s orlright.
’E’s a friend of mine. Why, ’e’s the bloke wot
told me to buyjthem,’ so we all went and had a
wet.
“I had five quid left, and, somehow or other,
I had a row with a cop. I found myself doin’
fourteen days in quod.
“ Well, I was makin’ for the pub, when I corned
out, when the bloke wot kidded me to buy the
shares lines up and, ses ’e, ‘ ’Ow de do? I was
lookin’ for you. 1 want to buy back them there
shares.’ Sol thinks to myself, ‘Now, ’oo’s this
bloke wot sells shares and wants to buy them back
again ? ’ While we was havin’ a wet, ’e ses, ‘ I’ll
give you three bob each for them there shares.’
You see, blokes, I’d told him I’d just come out of
quod. ‘Wot,’ ses I, ‘you sold them to me for
one and thrippence, and you’ll give me three bob
for them ? Why, there was a bloke like you up
our way wot was givin’ suvrins away for six-
pences. Some of your pals, I suppose?’ ‘’Ow
dare you, you low potato-man,’ ses ’e ; so, to stop
the argument, I plugged him in the jaw an’ ’ooked
it. Even as ’e was failin’ down an’ was sort o’
arf-way to the ground, I ’eard ’im say ’e’d give me
four bob for them shares.
“ I got 14 days for pluggin’ ’im. When I comes
out I thinks to myself ‘ Perhaps the old geezer in
the orfice will give me my fifty quid back for them
there shares, so I trots down.’ Ses I ‘What’ll
you give me for these Dook of Yorks ?’ Ses ’e,
‘ They smell of beer —phew ! I’ll give you six-
and-two for them.’ ‘Oh, h I,’ ses I, ‘take
them.’
“So he antes up—blokes, what do you think —
over two hundred and forty bloomin’ quid. So fill
’em up again, and we’ll drink ‘ the Dook of York,
Gorblessim.’ ”

A Letter From the Bush.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
Dear Bulletin, —You have printed one or two
“little letters from London,” and now I think it
is “up to you” to print one from Way-back.
lam “ full ”of bush life. Nothing but dust,
crows, and dying beasts. I can stand dust and
crows, and one poor meal a day, but the beseech-
ing looks of our old cows, that we had made pets
of, as they lay unable to rise, and dying of slow
starvation, haunt me day and night. I know
they appealed to me to knock them on the head ;
but Dad trusts in Providence to send the rain, so
they must needs suffer to the end. And the poor
sheep that die as their baby lambs are born—
baa-ing their last breath to scare off the waiting
crows—and the bareness, and eternal same-
ness, and the oft-proved uselessness of it all—
and—and—but I mustn’t dwell upon it.
I cribbed the paper I am writing on from the
school-teacher who boards on our farm —we
haven’t had such a luxury since Xmas—or a
stamp to spare. I got a fox scalp to-day while
out wood-oarting for Dad, so our luck is on the
turn. It means 2s 6d. Then I will post this on,
and spend the rest on a present for my mother
a cake of soap, or something useful.
I wish to get a billet down your way—only for
a living-wage, with a trifle over for tram fares.
I can plough, scarify, roll, work the reaper and
binder, combined harvester, cream separator,
erect a windmill, sink a well, milk, manage
horses, doctor beasts, stack wheat, make a hay-
stack, thatch a roof, prune trees, class wool,
shear, break in horses —but any fool can do these
things.
I come of a family of fools. Dad is a grafter,
straight, honest, sober and real good (when
there’s rain about) to mother and the kids but
he’s a fool. He wouldn’t be “cockying”on the
fringe of eternal debt and starvation if he wasn t.
Mother’s another, for allowing Dad to be a fool.
Every Jackass on the land is a fool—to himself.
All our neighbors are alike—of the soil, soily.
They have heads (so have we) like our cows and
horses, and not half the sense, or they would trust
more to themselves and less to Providence for
their food and water. Our school teacher is a
conundrum. He stays at our house, puts up with
the same fare as ourselves—and pays his board
regularly —in fact, mother is waiting for it on the
verandah on the first of every month. It carries
us on—for there has not been a penny of butter-
money this season. The teacher trusts to the
Department for his income and not to Providence.
Dad is going to make a big dam when the rain
comes. Why he doesn’t start to work straightaway,
instead of mooning round looking for the rain,
licks me. He was going to sell Bluegown and
Dimple—the two cows that died ; but he stuck out
for £8 2s. 6d. the pair when the dealer offered
even money. Dad wouldn’t budge because his
left leg felt rheumaticky. And, in the end, he
was glad to get 6s. for their hides.
Mother toils on, but is getting greyer every
day. Sis is only 17 next month. The census man
thought she was 40. All the younger kids look
old, and are skinny—dreadfully skinny—all
through nothing but the drought.
But I want to sneak away from here. I want
to see the sea; to see black clouds; to get wet
through and get a real cold, just to feel what it is
like. To get my feet soaking wet, to work—to
graft like sin at anything off the land. I won’t
mind working machinery if it isn’t mortgaged.
I’ll be glad to dig, deep and well, if there is a
hose fixed handy to water what I plant. I ’ll
drive horses and make them love me; milk cows;
shear and tend sheep—but I must have a contract
duly attested that they will be well-fed. I’ll
work the old hours —dawn till dusk, Sundays in ;
but no crows must caw within earshot. All the
birds I want to see are a few willie-wagtails—
they’re gay; and sparrows—they’re cheeky; and
a magpie or two —they ’re useful and plucky. But
let me get out of this. We ’ll go next if the rain
doesn’t come soon—then the crows will triumph.
The country can’t afford to lose Dad’s breed, fools
though they are.
RITA S.
A Sewing-Machine.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
My wife reckons her sewing-machine is a bit out
of date because it doesn’t mend socks, hem
trousers, sew on buttons, rock the baby to
sleep, and cook dinner, so she called on the Jigger
Sewing-Machine Co. to have a look at their much-
advertised modern implements. The young lady
in the shop assured her that they could perform
- all the above operations and play hymn tunes on
Sunday in addition. My wife made her inspec-
tion, and said she would think about the matter.
The young lady, however, froze on hard. “Do
you know,” she said, “your face is so familiar.
I’m sure I have met you somewhere ; are you not
Mrs. Samuel Jones, of Montmorency-street,
Waterloo ? ”
“No,” said my wife, innocently, “I’m Mrs.
Galvo, of Bondi.”
Profuse apologies from the young lady.
Next day, just as we were sitting down to
dinner, the door-bell rang and my wife answered.
I heard a scuffle, and went to see what was hap-
pening. A man with a sewing machine in his
arms was trying to thrust the same past my wife
into the hall against her vehement protests.
“ Doesn’t Mrs. Galvo live here ? ” he asked.
“Yes!”
“ Then I was told to leave this machine here
on approval for three months, and I’m going to.”
It seemed about time for me to take a hand, so
I sent my wife inside and addressed the man in
my best engine-erecting style: “If ycu don’t
take that crimson, spindle-legged, bone-shaking
abortion of a barrel-organ off these premises at
once, I’ll kick it and you down the steps and sool
the dog on to you ! ”
He went, sadly.
Next day, while I was out, a man called and
said he represented the Jigger Sewing Machine
Co., and had heard we wanted a machine.
He could assure us that their style possessed all
the latest improvements, with noiseless running,
ball-bearing silver griller attachments, and could
be worked by a child. My wife said she didn’t
want a machine, but he stuck his foot in the door
and held forth for ten minutes without effect.
Next day a woman came, who said she tra-
velled for the Jigger Sewing Machine Co., and
had been told we wanted a machine. My wife
said she was a hussie, and slammed the door in
the middle of her peroration. Following morning
another man stood on the step and delivered him-
self of the same rigmarole. My wife told him
she would complain to the manager if any more
travellers called, and he replied that he would be
most happy to transmit her complaint. He evi-
dently did so, for the next afternoon a fat, red-
whiskered man, smelling strongly of whisky,
arrived, and said he had called to apologise for
the excessive zeal of his travellers. He would not
like anything done which would prejudice my
wife against their patent Jigger sewing machines,
which he could assure her were the best in the
market, and would make Bayeux tapestry and
boil eggs. My wife indignantly told him that
she had intended buying one of his machines, but
was so disgusted at the treatment she had received
that she had now decided to obtain one from the
opposition. He smiled, bowed politely, and left,
and we thought the siege raised.
Two days later another traveller materialised,
and nearly sold us the same old Jigger machine
by professing to represent a rival firm and abus-
ing the Jigger people with fearful intensity.
Then an alleged third firm turned up, and abused
both the previous firms, and tried to sell us the
Jigger under another name. But I have nearly
completed the training of my bull-pup to bite
viciously whenever the word machine is men-
tioned, and when that is effected and he has taken
up his station at the front doorstep, we look for
such remnants of peace as may be left by the
bottle-oh man, the sauce-hawker, the buy-a-cheap-
load-of-firewood fiend, and the barrel-organist.
GALVO.
“K.K.”: Was padding the hoof at the
back of Wanganui (where the lunatics come from)
when, turning a sharp bend in the road, nearly
collided with a man running as if for his life and
a little farther saw a great smoke. Asked the
fellow where he was going and whether the smoke
was a house on fire. “No,” he said, “that’s a
neighbor of mine burning weeds. She’s a widow,”
he said, beginning to get a move on again, “and
when I see a widow burning her weeds I’m off to
a safer place,” and with a wild howl he galloped
away.


Face
“ I gradually sank into a state of ill-health,” says Elizabeth Corkran,
of 8 Milton Place, Richmond, Melbourne. “My blood became impoverished,
and unsightly pimples and blotches
appeared on my face and neck. The
doctors whom I consulted pronounced
it to be an acute form of Eczema, and,
although they treated me for some
time, my health gradually grew worse.
I could scarcely eat any food, and
what I did eat disagreed with me, and
the suffering I endured at times was
dreadful. I also tried various medi-
cines advertised, but without result,
and I was altogether in a very des-
pondent mood, until, one day, I re-
ceived a pamphlet wherein I noticed
where fellow-sufferers had been cured of similar complaints to my own by
the judicious use of Bile Beans and Zam-Buk Ointment, and I decided to
give them a fair trial. I underwent a course of the Beans, and at the same
time applied Zam-Buk Ointment to the blemishes on my face and neck.
After a week of this treatment I noticed some improvement, which became
more pronounced week after week, until now—just two months since I
began the treatment—lndigestion has entirely left me, and my skin is now
quite clear, and, as you may imagine, such a perfect and speedy cure came
as a great surprise to me, after so many other treatments had proved
unavailing.”
ZAM-BUK OINTMENT is practically the only ointment in Australasia entirely free
from animal fats and minerals. Zam-Buk is purely vegetable and will be found a certain
cure for CUTS, BURNS, BOILS, BRUISES, RUNNING SORES, PILES, ECZEMA,

Andrew Barr, of Doodlekine.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
Andrew Barr, farmer, of Doodlekine (Westralia), clauus
to have invented a flying machine that will travel at tne
rate of 100 miles an hour, and carry a weight up to louu
tons. It is to be driven by a gasoline motor. He states
that he has been experimenting with flying machines for
over 20 years.
This is the ballad of Andrew Barr,
Farmer, and sage who brought a sign ;
Inventor bold of the flying car—
Pride and glory of Doodlekine.
Greece had Athens, and Italy Home —
Names that in history’s pages shine —
London’s the boast of the folk at home,
But Australia rejoices in Doodlekine.
Twenty years on flying machines
Andrew worked with his humble means.
While others were growing turnips and beans,
Potatoes, parsnips, and curly greens,
And their days were heavy with sordid toil,
And their souls were planted deep in the soil,
Andrew walked with his head in air,
And his soul in the clouds, and his eyes aglare
With the glare of genius that strange things sees,
Wonderful visions and mysteries.
Little for turnips did Andrew care,
With his soul in the clouds and his head in the air.
Wonderful are the ways of Fate ;
Long does she keep her chosen hid ;
Silent for years are the truly great —
Till suddenly opens the casket lid,
And winged wonders spring upward then,
And dazzle the world of the common men.
Who were the people that garnered Fame ?
Who were the people that made a name,
Trumpeting round the afflicted land
The tale of their deeds and intentions grand,
Till even the deaf, perforce, took heed ?
Barton, High Pontiff, and rollicking Reid,
Forrest the rugged-, and Deakin the fine,
Kingston courageous, and lumbering Lyne.
Melbourne, and Sydney, and Adelaide,
Famous thrice over by them were made,
While nobody heard, or could divine,
Of Andrew Barr, or of Doodlekine.
Maxim, and Dumont, and Zeppelin—
All of the aeronaut kith and kin—
Each puts up his shutters, and burns his car,
And uncovers his head to Andrew Barr.
In the years to come, as men will see,
People will travel to Doodlekine
As pilgrims go to the holy shrine;
Sacred to Science the place will be,
As Stratford-on-Avon to Poetry.
Amurrikan citizens will come,
And the queer Land of the Chrysanthemum
Will send her contingent of pilgrims rum,
And the place will then like a bee-hive hum
With praises, in many a tongue bizarre,
Of Doodlekine, and of Andrew Barr.
O Andrew Barr, take gude Scotch heed,
And make this prophecy true indeed !

An Episode.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
The white, straight road made by white men
runs through the middle, and on either side lies
the Older World. That is why the Englishman
riding on the white road looks at the Maori pah
with no understanding ; for there is a matter of
several centuries between, and to the door of
these centuries the Englishman has found no key,
because he does not know that the door is locked.
By law of Nature, therefore, each caste should
hold to itself ; by law of man, it consequently does
not.
There was a Maori girl once belonging to this
pah, and she was beautiful in a way low-grade
Maoris rarely are. The pah was proud of her, and
the white men who came down the road stared at
her supple figure, and her delicate hair, and her
brown eyes with the gold lights; and in many
cases they came back and stared again.
One day she went away, and the old women
nodded their heads together, and the young
women whispered, half envious, and one or two
of the men were angry, for they loved her. But
all this part of the story belongs to two years ago.
The meeting-house of the pah stood back from
the road, under giant trees that had grown over
the holes trenched out in the Maori \\ ar. Ihe
pakeha said that the carvings in it were very
wonderful, and very hideous, and marvelled be-
cause they did not know that the Maori idea of
beauty is ugliness.
It had been a sacred place once, before the
Maori began to wear European clothing and get
drunk. Now all those families who had not gone
away and pretended to be pakeha slept in it on
mats laid round the walls, and bought a couple of
iron bedsteads at an auction mart to keep their
boots on. There were nine families in it al-
together, and it. was thirty feet long by fourteen
wide, with one window that wouldn t open.
It ’ was the very hottest evening of a hot
summer, and all the men were asleep on the
burnt grass before the meeting-house, and all the
women were smoking and talking a little, and
laughing over the fat naked babies that rolled
with the dogs. The white, straight road made by
the white nien after their kind reeled under the
dying sun, and pretended that it stretched right
round the world. It was indubitably twenty-two
miles long.
A black speck had walked down it for fifteen
miles, and ten miles of a by-road before that--but
at the broken gate of the pah it stopped, and, the
dust falling away, proved it to be a Maori girl,
with a child on her back. The child’s legs hung
down limply below the thick shawl, and its head
rolled limply on its neck. It gazed with blue
eyes at its mother’s back, and its hair was fair,
like that of the pakeha.
Slowly the girl came through the gate, and
slowly up to the meeting-house. There was a
rough carving of Maui pulling up the North Island
on the front beam, and she dropped her eyes from
it. For who was she to look upon a god ?
At the closed-in end of the verandah-place stood
a carved white man among the lesser gods. He
was one of the few quite good men on record, and
the girl did not want to look at him either. She
paused before the women, but did not lift her eyes.
For she had been too long with English ways to
meet them face to face, and—knowing English
ways—she was afraid.
“Tena, koutou,” she said, softly, and the old
women looked up. Some were her aunts and
grandmothers ; one was her mother.
“ Tena koe,” said they, and the mother got up,
waddling across the grass.
‘‘ He tamaiti! ” she cried, and pulled the child
out of the shawl, grunting in admiration.
“I have come back,” said the girl, un-
emotionally. “I am weary. Can I sleep 1 ”
“ Koia! My bed is near empty these days,”
and the mother chuckled with her lips to the pale
baby-skin.
Then she followed the girl into the meeting-
house, and squatted on the earth.
“ He is go marry a white wahine ? ” she said, in
the careful English that was meant as compliment
to her daughter.
The girl nodded, with all the carven gods of her
ancestors frowning down on her as they had
frowned in her childhood.
“He aha!”
The girl spread her hands in speechless gesture.
They who say that the Maori is excitable speak
truth. But they who say that he is phlegmatic
speak truth also.
“I know,” said the old woman with serene
certainty; “I know why. Our skin shrivels
early, and when our teeth go we are not good to
see. The pakeha think that our souls change
with our skins, and they marry to a white girl.
They are all fools, and of a tribe of fools. But
the child’s skin will not shrivel.”
The girl laid the boy on the mat and went to
sleep beside him. And thereafter she went about
her old work in the pah, and there was none made
comment, nor showed any concern. For they are
a wise people, the Maoris, and they quite under-
stand the white man’s limitations, and grant him
license therefor.
But the girl understood a little more—which in
her case totalled-up to so much less—and so the
side which the pakeha made English went in
shame and self-condemnation and all the other
things that are the sign of an enlightened intellect.
And the white straight man who made the
white straight road —this pakeha said to the men
of his caste when they spoke of the Outer World
that lay by the roadside : “ Savages, and ignorant
to the last degree, every one of them, I give you
my word.” Which was quite natural, because
the pakeha did not know any better.
There is very little that matters in this story
when you come to think of it, because no one made
talk of it —not even when the boy grew up to
despise his people.
For—having white blood in him—that was quite
natural too.

“’Hoppers.”
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
We were cutting scrub for sheep on Carson’s, and
our camp contained some really competent liars,
but all had to bow before the cook—a weird-
looking little object with a face as expressionless
as a copper dinner-plate, and an eye like a dead
mussel. Black Bill, a huge roach-backed mass of
humanity, with a figure like a badly-made S, had
been holding forth at some length upon the dis-
astrous effect of the grasshoppers during the
previous spring, when the cook chipped in
thusly:—
“Grasshoppers! Last spring! You should
have been with us two years ago, when we was
tank-sinkin’ on Yalgogrin. We’d been gettin’ on
first-rate, an’ was within a week of finishin’, when
one mornin’ the boss comes out to see how we’re
progressin’, and casually mentions that the
’hoppers was pretty bad at the homestead.
Well, of course, we couldn’t see how they was
goin’ to affect us, but we soon found out. A
couple of days later, as we was goin’ to work,
Jimmy, the ploughman, calls our attention to the
fac’ that the ’hoppers was cornin’ in earnest; and
by dinner-time they was six inches deep in the
tank, and the horses slippin’ and failin’ on the
batters. After dinner they was upwards of three
feet of ’hopper in the tank, an’ altho’ we worked
like blazes we couldn’t make no head against ’em ;
so after a bit we give ’em best, an’ started won-
derin’ what was the nex’ move.
“Presently the ole man suggests buildin’ a
brush brake about ten feet high all round the
tank Outside the dirt tip. We started at once,
an’ by sundown had the job finished. In the
mornin’ the ’hoppers hadn’t riz any, an’ we felt
better accordin’. After leadin’ the horses in we
closed up the gateway an’ started scoopin’, but
about the same time the ’hoppers got on the
move agen outside. In a couple of hours they
was flowin’ in over the brake a sight faster’n we
could scoop ’em out, so we had to give ’em best
again.
“For two days the air was so full of ’em that
we couldn’t breathe comfortable outside the tent,
but by the third mornin’ the most of ’em was gone
an’ things began to clear up a bit. Of course we
goes to have a look at the tank first thing, but
be’old, there wasn’t any tank ! It was full of
’hoppers right up to the top of the brake, an’
speakin’ moderately, there must have been at
least twenty thousand cubic yards of ’em packed
in that tank. We was all broke-up, an’ the ole
cove fairly wept.
“Presently, though, he bounds up with a yell,
an’ grabs a firestick an’ rushes at the brake an’
starts firin’ it all round. We joined in, an’ as
there was a lolj of dry Stuff in it, it was soon
blazin’. Presently the hoppers began to heave
and stir, an’ all at once with one vast, almighty,
concentrated kick they scattered that brake all
over the landscape.
“Of course there was a fire, an’ we was away
beltin’ at it for three days. When we got back
the ’hoppers was all dead an’ had subsided a good
deal, but the tank was still half full and smelt bad.
But we wired in, an’ although we had to plough
the last couple of feet on account of the horses
treadin’ ’em down solid, we shifted that mass of
’hopper an’ finished the tank inside a week.” .
Then we retired silently to our bunks.
THE WASTER.
The re-arming of the British Army with a
new rifle is to be carried out at once. The
weapon is called the Lee-Enfield Modified, and
is five inches shorter than the old one. The bore
is slightly enlarged from ten inches back to the
muzzle, doing away with a lot of friction, and so
giving greater range. The mechanism altogether
is very much, simpler than the old pattern, and
the loading will be done with clips, as with the
Mauser. Also, Australia will be expected to buy
up the old discarded rifles as usual.

Mrs. John Evans, of Subiaco,
West Australia, sends this pho-
tograph of herself and children,
and says:
“ Whenever any member of
my family becomes pale, weak,
debilitated, or suffers from im-
pure blood, I always fall back on
Ayer’s Sarsaparilla and Ayer’s
Pills. I give the Pills to keep
the bowels all right and the
Sarsaparilla to make the blood
pure and strengthen the nerves.
Ayer’s Sarsaparilla carried my
husband through a bad attack
of influenza, and later it also
cured him of rheumatism. I
have often given it to my chil-
dren when they have lost their
appetite and become listless. I
practise as a nurse, and fre-
quently recommend Ayer’s Sarsaparilla for the very try ingcli mate of this country.
And I can truthfully say that both nurse and patient are always greatly pleased.”
“The World’s Createst Family sied^cine. ,,
This testimonial should convince every one who reads it of the great value
of Ayer’s Sarsaparilla as a blood-purifier and general tonic. Mrs. Evans
speaks as a mother, ever watchful over the health of those most dear to her.
She also speaks as a professional nurse, one who knows just what effect these
medicines have on those who are suffering.
Be sure you get Ayer’s Sarsaparilla. There are a great many substitute
Sarsaparillas on the market that will disappoint you. Avoid imitations.

“X. ” : In a Ballarat Star of 1874 I came across an
astounding case of an aetor paying off his old debts. The
paragraph gratefully records that Mr. R. Lawrence
(father of ; Ada Lawrence), who came to grief at the
Theatre Royal, Ballarat, some three years previously',
had been remitting money from India in settlement of
his old liabilities, “ the final payment of a small account
due to this office, the existence of which had been almost
forgotten, having been made to-day.” That was 30
years ago. Nowadays, actors and managers don’t trouble
to disturb the forgetfulness of newspapers re their
ancient advt. accounts.

Melbourne Harbinger op Light is still harping on the
subject of two Italian mediums, sons of a certain
Baroness Bordonaro, who, not being at all musical them-
selves, have been selected by some spirits to take down
an operatic score from dictation. Spirit Felix started to
convey the libretto of an opera to the younger of the
Bordonaro brethren on Dec. 10, 1901, and completed it at
subsequent sittings up to May 20 last year. The music
was dictated simultaneously by Jo (another spirit). It
seems that at the outset of this wondrous task another
spirit named Assova chipped in and made himself un-
pleasant. He was discovered to have been a former
friend of the Bondonaro family, who died in a lunatic
asylum. His interruptions ceased after a time, so it is
probable that the sane spirits gagged him. The spirit
title given to this opera was, “ I Travolti,” and the excel-
lence of the first act drew a testimonial, says the Har-
binger, from Signor Sapio, conductor of the orchestra
at the Urso-Sapio concerts long ago. For startling musi-
cal items one must go to the spiritualistic press.
Charley Brookfield’s just issued volume of reminis-
cences is worth glancing over. He was a popular London
comedian not long ago, and his yarns are mostly good.
Here is one : A Guardsman went to a London Music Hall
and persuaded the chairman that he was Signor Vesuvio,
the great Italian conjuror. He went on the stage to
oblige with a turn. Borrowed a nice new belltopper,
a sharp knife, and a shawl from three different people.
Then he cut off the rim of the hat with the knife, put
them under the shawl, and said, “ I will leave these for
two minutes, and you shall see what you shall see.” The
band struck up the “ Blue Danube ’’ as he went off at the
vying. He hurried to the stage door and took a hansom.
The May number of the New Idea contains an appre-
ciation of the late Charles Clark by his old friend and
manager, R. S. Smythe. “ People have talked about the
large audiences drawn by Madame Melba,” says R.S.S.,
“but the audiences that went to hear the diva sing
could not be compared with the crowds that flocked to
hear the Rev. Chas. Clark.” That was during his first
lecture tour, and he subsequently made four tours with
slowly diminishing success. Clark’s friendship with
Smythe extended over 25 years. Had Clark paid a sixth
visit to the land of Smythe he might have saved his life.
Or he might have died on Smythe’s hands, which would
have been inconvenient for both parties.
“Beer-puller”: Re “Matchbox’s” statement (8.,
31/5/’O3) as to mummers being as plentiful as starving
stock and mostly in a worse condition ! The average
mummer (and I will admit their name is legion, as
mummers, not as actors or artists) has the cast-iron
cheek of a penny-in-the-slot machine out of order,
coupled with the lying, hypnotic duplicity of Yankee
confidence salesmen. Ask any pubkeeper on the main
routes patronised by swindling mummers, and he
will tell you the same story of hall rents unpaid,
meals and beds (the best in the house), and not a
cent forthcoming. All the mummer (not the actor) wants
to do, is to live from day to day. Women are taking to
this confidence game, and are the keenest at it. Ask
any pressman, printer, publican, bellman, carrier, hall-
keeper, etc., etc., and if “Matchbox” can bring one
of these Vic. individuals (sober, mind) to say the average
mummer does not live on the fat of the land, then I’ll
shout champagne for “(Matchbox.” Why, mumming, so-
called, is the greatest confidence game abroad on the
roads to-day, and the worst of it is that all the satisfaction
you can get out of the presumptuous swindlers is to
seize their carpet-bag of bricks (for they never bring their
duplicate kit to their diggings), while they skip with
their properties worn under their knock-about-the-streets
garb. There are honest companies, of course, but they
are actors—not mummers. I know some of the honest
ones—Dan Barry’s, for a shining example.
Thackeray and his friend Higgins, known as Jacob
Omnium, went to see a giant at a fair. Thackeray was
6ft. 4in., and Higgins 6ft. 6in. The proprietor said,
“ Gents, if you’re in the profession, there’s no charge.”
An amateur actor recently had a high compliment paid
him. He wag the comedian of a company playing before
the patients of a North London lunatic asylum. The
performance was going splendidly', as he thought,
and he grimaced and clowned, and the audience shrieked
with laughter. Finally a gmall voice came from the
back of the room—“ You’d better stay ’ere, sir ! ”
Melb. Age dramatic critic let lbose his pent-up feelings
over Musgrove’s production of “ As You Like It,” and
poured forth a quarter-column of ancient English
geography and natural history thusly : “ Wolves were to
be found in the highlands of Scotland, herds of wild cattle
in Northumberland, beavers in Wales, eagles in Shrop-
shire, and badgers everywhere.” If he had also added
that the cockroach was reasonably numerous, his in-
formation would have left nothing to be desired.
How they enjoy the play up at Charters Towers (Q.).
Thus the local Telegraph, describing What happened
after a woman in the theatre audience had fainted “ when
Nemo, the Vulture, was shaking his long claws at all and
sundry ” :—“The curtain dropped and the crowd pressed
round the female in distress. ‘ Twist her beak,’ said one,
4 that’s the thing to revive her.’ Then another shouted :
‘ Stand back you silly fools and give ’er plenty of hair.
It’s hair she wants.’ • Smoke her out,’said another, and
forthwith a dozen smokers who were looking on com-
menced to puff smoke into her face. She revived. But
when the curtain rolled up on a new act things were only
seen.through a dim mist of blue smoke.”
The London correspondent of the Argus tells the
candid truth about Miss Bertha Bird, a Melbourne g rl
who journeyed to England awhile ago on the strength of
an absurdly abnormal top note. Miss Bird, it seems,
gave a “successful concert at St. James’ Hall” —the
same successful concert that all aspirants give if funds
and friends will run to it—and repeated her oft sung
“ cadenza terminating in Ain alt.” Melbourne remem-
bers Miss Bird and her A in alt without the least
enthusiasm. The Argus man, for a wonder, admits that
“ except for this wonderful highness Miss Bird’s voice is
not remarkable ”; also that in an air from “ Ernani ” “ the
singer was clearly overweighted and her intonation was
faulty.” All the same, Miss Bird is likely to appear
occasionally in some more cable messages, and her
supposed triumphs will unsettle the minds .of other
girls who haven’t gone to Europe yet, but are pardonably
convinced that they ought to be able to equal Bertha's
“success.”
John Prouse, the ex-Maoriland timber merchant, who
went to the United States on a concert tour recently,
was 15 years ago a choir baritone of the common or
garden variety. After a little tuition, he went to the
Big Smoke, and, some 10 months after his arrival there,
was classed as a second Santley. Since his return, Mr.
Prouse has been called upon to sing with many big com-
panies touring Maoriland. Two years ago he and his
daughter travelled all over Australia with Mme. Dolores,
and now they are off to join her in an extended tour of
the United States and British Columbia.
