Says the celebrated author of “Robbery Under Arms”:—“ln these Tales of the Austral Tropics will be found the strange
romances which write themselves, often in letters of blood, amid the half-unknown, mysterious regions of tropical Australia. That they
are not less true than terrible I take it upon myself to affirm.
“ The writer has turned scene-painter for the nonce and limned with strongest lifelike effect the Drama of the Waste.”

HARD TIMES,
Dr SPF.KR has determined to REDUCE his FEES to
exactly ONE-HALF of those usually charged, and he
trusts that this will prove itself
GOOD NEWS INDEED
to those thousands of poor hut honest sufferers, who,
thoU'di willing to pay a small fee proportionate to their
meaifs are quite unable to pay the enormous charges so
often made.
Dr. SPEER wishes it to be distinctly understood that
his charge is INCLUSIVE, and that when once he takes a
curable case in hand he names a fee which includes all
advice, attendance and medicines until the patient is
completely cured. It therefore naturally becomes his
object to cure his patient as quickly as possible.
NERVOUSNESS.
CONSULT Dr. SPEER in all cases of NERVOUSNESS
and WEAKNESS, for his many years of practice with
these diseases enables him to r, move nil traces of them,
and to return the victims to full VIGOR and HEALTH.

This eminent Specialist, Founder, and Chief
Surgeon of the long-established and favourably-
known Dispensary that now bears his name, re-
ceived his medical education and surgical training
in the leading colleges and hospitals of Europe,
lie has devoted a life- time to the study of
Nervous Complaints.
He has by profound research thoroughly investi-
gated their origin, traced their deadly sources and
insidious dissemination, and ascertained the surest
and safest methods by which they may be eradi-
cated; with these widely recognised Qualifications
combined with unswerving faithfulness to his
patients, he has during his practice, extending
over FORTY YEARS, attained a well-deserved
pre-eminence in their treatment. His practice
embraces diseases which probably cause more un-
happiness than any other class of troubles that
afflict mankind.
DO YOU SUFFER
from headaches, drowsiness during the day, circles
round the eyes, giddiness, irregularity of the
bowels, specks before the eyes, bashfulness, dis-
contentedness, weakness or pain in the back, liver
or kidney complaints, buzzing in the ears and
head, pimples, a fear that something dreadful is
about to happen, weak stomach, yellow or blood-
shot eyes, constipation, impure blood, hasty,
uncontrollable temper, hacking cough, nervous-
ness in society, wakefulness, palpitation of the
heart, general weakness, a fear of insanity and
death, if so, send 6d. in stamps to the above
address, and you will, by return of post, receive
postage
FREE, A LARGE
CLOTH BOUND BOOK,
showing plainly how all diseases, which result in
the above-named symptoms, may be cured with-
out unnecessary expense. This book will prove a
valuable companion, and even though you be per-
fectly well, its general information and prescrip-
tions may assist you in restoring some poor friend
to health, even though his case has been previously
pronounced incurable.
One Pound is Sufficient to Send
for remedies necessary to cure any ordinary com-
plaint. Should you require medical treatment, as
procrastination is sometimes dangerous, it would
be advisable for you to sit down quietly in your
chamber and write to the Doctor detailing all
experienced symptoms. He will, on receipt of
such a letter, write you promptly and courteously
a candid and straightforward opinion of your
case. If you do not think you understand your
case, send for his famous medical work, the price
of which is but 6d. ; enclosed in the volume
will be found a list of carefully-prepared questions
which will assist you materially in describing
your ailments. Dr. Richards uses nothing but
the purest remedies, and never prescribes injurious
drugs under any circumstances. Dr. Richards
has successfully treated nearly 30,000 cases since
coming to Australia, and has permission from, at
least, 15,000 persons to show their written evidence
of his success. All communications should be

A Month, in a Sydney Hospital.
(FOR THE BULLETIN.)
The world is full of men over 40 who are
not physicians. I’m one, else would I have
applied at once for admittance to one of the metro-
politan hospitals. The symptoms were those of
lumbago, sciatica, an apparently- twisted spine,
and a temper like that of Mr. Justice M illiams, of
Victoria.
“ My dear fellow,” said thesurgeon, “you’ve got
a lumbar abscess which, from a professional stand-
point, leaves nothing to be desired. It is a credit
to you, and is a pathological lecture in itself. It
liiiist have been of slow growth, for no merely
human system could develope such a bulge at
short notice. I’ve seen but two like it. One was
grown at sea and brought to the Edinburgh In-
firmary by a Russian sailor. His skeleton is in
the Museum now. I almost forget where I saw
the other. However, the thing to do now is to
send at bnce for the Alfred Hospital ambulance.
I shall be over there all the afternoon as it is
operation-day.
“ Do you think there’s arty danger, doctor ? ”
“ Well, in every operation there is, of course;
an element of danger sometimes from the
patient’s low condition Or faintheartedness, some-
times from the character of the work to be done,
and, once in a way (blandly), from the person who
does it. But cheer up. I see no earthly reason
why you shouldn’t be well again—a new man, in
fact—Within a month or six weeks.”
Hardly knowing at the time where the bigger
swelling was, at my back or at my heart, I kept
my appointment.
* * *
“ Have you had anaesthetics before ?”
asked the ether-giver as I lay on the table in ray
native innocence.
“Never,” I replied.
The droll, little, oddly-shaped ether-cup was
now over my nose, a sweetish taste in my mouth,
a sense of pressure on chest and ears, recalling to
my mind a lang-syne experience when, while
endeavouring to rescue a man who had jumped
into 20 feet of water, I toed the border-line of
unconsciousness; in my soul a desire to blather,
and prate, and then—oblivion.
# * *
“ When are they goin’ to operate ?” I
yawped at an uncanny thing that appeared to
stand a long way off beckoning and grinning.
It was only the wardsman putting me to bed and
smiling at the resources of my half-loosened
tongue. “He must be povverful when in proper
trim,” he observed methodically. It is but fair
to say, lipwevey, that the face of a smiling man is
not at its best when seen through ether fumes. It
is too faithful an imitation pf a gargoyle to inspire
confidence.
“It’s all right,” replied the wardsman, “and
what you’ve got to do now is to keep quiet and go
to sleep. ”
To sleep I went, but not to rest. The wards-
man was the official who helped to carry subjects
to the operating-room and bring back what was
left. Sometimes the latter didn’t amount to
much— a nucleus of half-awakened and blatant
consciousness, with most of the tentacles lopped
off. For days I was light-beaded at night (nothing
like putting a thing properly), but gradually the
lightness left my head and went to my stomach.
By degrees it dawned upon me that life would be
idyllic if the days were bounded at each end by
pork chops, while corned beef or legs of mutton
occupied the middle. It may be a gross way of
viewing things, but it is open to argument whether
any pleasure of a merely mental or ideal nature
can compare with the first faint promptings of
returning appetite after a serious illness-promp-
tings which, if unsatisfied, quickly develope from
whispers into bellows. But the doctors were in-
exorable, and the nurses followed in their foot-
steps—no difficult thing in some eases. At the
head of all ridiculous ideas is that of expecting an
Alfred Hospital nurse to give you a pdte in mistake
for porridge. Low diet is the first rule of the
institution.
The iyard contained 14 beds, with a bath-
roonj at one angle and a general-utility apartment
at the opposite. “ General-utility” is perhaps the
expression that best describes the latter, since it
was used, as a pantry, a kitchen, a general store,
and a convenient retiring-room for the nurses
when, they wished to exchange confidences over a
cup of tea. Occasionally a mild flirtation was
carried op there, just to keep the ladies in touch
with the outside world, divert their minds from
the grqesome sights of. the ward, and, in a
meiasure, keep their hands in till the weekly or
fortnightly leave-day. Not that a woman, when
young apd prepossessing, as many of the Alfred
nurses ate, is likely to forget how to make eyes
even if in a convent-cell with none but a palsied
priest to practise on. Fut her to sweep out a
morgue and she’ll regard with interest the
undemonstrative persons on the tables.
But tjiere were necessarily few eligibles among
the'patients. Some Were tooold, some too young,
some too broken-up or down, and all too poor. In
the whole room there was probably not enough
money to send an overWeight'letter as far as the
Suez 1 Canal. Besides, tenderness is a plant of
delic'ate structure. It will not flourish in the
vicifiity of two people one of whom has either a
wooden leg hr an uncontrollable desire to place a
hydatid cyst at the other’s feet, At 8 p.ni. the
lights were turned down to a point, and all good
wrecks expected to rest,
“Ah ! terrible Gahagans,” remarked
Napoleon, on his way from Moscow, as his sledge
topped a mound of the Old Guard, all bearing the
Gahagan mark. Ah ! those terrible hours between
eight and midnight in the accident-ward of the
Alfred. How all the mistakes and maunderings
and meannesses' of yesOta parade fbr inspection
before you—each foolishness leering as it
swaggers past the' saluting-point, in step witli
the half-stifled whimperings of men in pain!
A head and shoulders’ above this dismal litany
were two sounds that followed and chivvied each
other like the strophe' and anti-strbphe of a Greek
play. There Was no seasoning of suffering in
them. - So fur from it, they Suggested that the
persons in charge of them were convinced that
whatever is, is right. They were snores from two
juxtaposed bullock-drivers snores that cotild
hold tip their htiiids in any society. It is singular
what the human nose is capable of when it
is neglected. The mouth, the eyes, the hair, the
chin, even the ears, have been suiur. But the
most prominent feature of all—the organ which
gives'tono and light and leading to the others
has hoert* s<o slighted by Wribulhrs 1 thht, like the
dying swan, it is obliged’to sing for itself. It was
a mistake to put these two patients together.
They merely encouraged each other. A cow had
gored the first, a horse kicked the second. J u
each case the animal had unfortunately missed
the really objectionable feature. The lower
animals are irreolaimably stupid in that way
they always leave a job half-done.
Strange what grotesque fancies will arise in the
minds of sufferers kept from sleep by noises like
the foregoing! The man next me, crippled
through colliding with a fire-engine, said that
when the duet started, his memory at once vaulted
over a full score of years. It was the village
green with a stump in the middle over which the
wheel of the parson’s buggy had just passed. The
divine was on the ground, his list, wife in the air.
She was quickly beside him—on him, in fact.
And as she alighted on his diaphragm with a blunt
thud the poor lady had just time to say, “lam
innocent!” before his sternum collapsed,
# * *
I used often to wonder why children’s
hospitals should be established —why boj's and
girls couldn’t be treated in institutions for adult
patients as well as in buildings dedicated to
infants alone. I wonder no longer. To explain.
There Were two lads in the Alfred surgical watd
during my stay, and it is no traveller’s tale to say
that their chatter all the day long, and fat into
the night, made many a mature sufferer regret not
having died in infancy. Close upoii this feeling
came the more earnest sorrow that the youths
themselves hadn’t been still-born, or, at least,
tongue-tied in a novel and incurable fashion. At
last, one evening, a tumor man, who’d been
hacked at during the forenoon,. and naturally
yearned for quiet, put all the Venom of a long
life into the question—“ Will nobody squelch
those brats?” During the remainder of my
sojourn he uttered no further query. For One of
the nurses dived from behind a screen with
a bow-wow that turned him on his back, limp and
abject. In her eyes they were not rowdy larrikins
who kept a roomful of sick men in a high state of
nervous tension, but a brace of thoughtful children
who were sure to become useful citizens. _ The
fact is, whether in hospital or outside, it is the
women who are mainly responsible for the
abominable manners of Australian bantlings.
The larrikin will never be suppressed till the
hysterical or slobbering mother', who cuddled his
tender caprices into robust vices, is first put down,
or else relieved of maternal solicitude by the
remoVal of her darlings.
It is open to argument whether, for male acci-
dent wards, male attendants wouldn’t be best. It
is men, not women, who are specially modest. A
woman will submit to bodily examination by a
number of male surgeons, old or young, with far
more composure than a man to a similar experi-
ment by female ones. There are plenty
of men, too, who, through prejudice, or sen-
timent, or some obscure mental peculiarity,
or even the character of the operation undergone
by them, do not take kindly to female minis-
trations. At any rate, had there been male nurses
at the Alfred, the two youths mentioned would
have been heard and pawed less. At the same
time, it is but fair to remember that male patients
always obey a female nurse far more cheerily than
they do a man. When she happens to be fair
and they convalescent, they fetch and carry, scrub,
swab, wash dishes, build fires, roll bandages, and
perform many more objectionable offices at her
bidding. They even take medicine for her, and
look as if'they enjoyed it, which is about the best
proof a man can give of a sincere desire to please.
On the whole, it might perhaps be as well to con-
tinue employing women in male surgical wards,
provided talkative boys were either gagged or
removed.
# # •
Ladies occasionally called at the ward with
flowers and books and tracts. Sometimes they
sang, very sweetly too. But the songs mostly
related to Jerusalem and jasper gates.. Once they
asked our only Chinese patient— he had been
gored by a pig—to favour them with a ditty. He
did,. There was nothing in his countenance or
. voice to show whether the stave was devotional or
amatory ; martial or Anacreontic. But it shifted
the ladies. Orad.ually they stole out one by one
till the daintily-fringed petticoat of the last
flattered in the distance, when from parapet to
i basement of John’s face crept an expression of.
profound peace which said plainly enough, “ alone
L did it.”

How She Died.
Thp moon shone down most dutiful,.
Out of an azure sky,
]7ull on a creature beautiful,
Who slow my hut passed by.
Her limpid eyes were glistening
As though some grief she’d hide
At times she halted, listening,
Anon would onward glide.
An air, she had of haughtiness
(The pride of long descent),
And yet a deed of naughtiness
’Twas on which she was bent. ..
In state, with such celerity,
Towards the shaft she swept
On seeing such temerity
Strong men might well have wept.
She glanced, around affrighted)y.
But climbed the heap o* dirt,
Then cast her eye, delightedly
On my old flannel shirt!
I’d left it out, unthinkingly.
When going home for tea ; .
She lifted it unwinkingly,
And chewed it up with glee.
This was a find encouraging,
But more came after that—
She got, by skilful foraging.
My waistcoat, watch, and hat.
Adown her sweet tesophagus
The flannel shirt they chased,'
And found a safe sarcophagus
Beyond her slender waist.
With appetite diminishing
11 er ardour seemed to flag ;
But wound up all by finishing
That little canvas bag.
The whole earth shook convulsively,
Destruction reigned complete,
And down there fell, impulsively,
(Heat gobs of gore and meat!
The residents of China might
Have hoard the fearful row :
The bag was full of dynamite,
Sire was Smith’s p ley cow !

her charm to the other sex much lessened. Let the woman take Frazer s
Sulphur Tablets internally and use Frazer’s Sulphur Soap externally.

blemish, and a blood free from the taint of fever and infectious germs. Let

Soap externally.

that holds disease at bay and gives health.

The Gasbag Regime.
Another want-of-confidence motion—the
third or fourth during the present session—
looms in the New South Wales Assembly as
we write, and the course of what is humor-
ously described as public “business” pro-
mises to be again blocked for an indefinite
period. Government by Contradiction is in
a bad way in Australia. The time has
arrived when Parliament can accomplish
nothing of any value owing to the ceaseless
rush and bustle of small adventurers hunger-
ing after office. A South American republic
is the emblem of political stability by com-
parison with almost any of the Australian
provinces, and particularly by comparison
with New South Wales, where politics are
fast approaching a permanent deadlock.
Party Government, in its final and complete
state, knows only two alternatives. There
is, first, the normal or orthodox period when
the Opposition opposes everything, and
blocks everything by ceaseless debates, by
want-of-confidence motions, by questions,
motions for adjournment, personal explana-
tions, recriminations, demands for useless
papers, demands for select committees,
amendments, motions that the chairman
do leave the chair, motions that the
chairman do report progress, motions
that the bill before the House be read
that day six months, motions that the
House be counted, and several dozen other
soyts and varieties of stonewalling. This
was the state of things in New South Wales
during the period when Pakkes and Robert-
son shuffled in and out of office alternately,
when the feeble Jenninos-Dibbs Cabinet
held the fort against a small but rowdy and
drunken and venomous Opposition, when
O’Loghlkn attempted to govern Victoria
with a hand of straw, when Maoriland was
getting ready for the Stout-Vooel combina-
tion ; and it is now becoming the permanent
state of things almost everywhere. While
this condition lasts, no measure, however
beneficial and however urgently required, is
passed unless by some extraordinary acci-
dent. And then there follows the inevitable
period of Coalition when every villainous
and fraudulent proposition is passed without
question, when the Parliament feels itself
independent of the nation, and gives up the
last pretence of attempting to do anything
for the public good, and settles down to
hard, continuous, unmitigated swindling of
the most glaring description. But for one
exception in a generation or thereabouts, it
is blank anarchy and highway robbery turn
about.
* # #
Queensland, where the unspeakable Coali-
tion has re-established Kanaka slavery and
the importation of cheap labour at the public
expense, has made the franchise a mere
perquisite of Property, and is engaged in
appropriating for its gang about one-third of
the whole area of the province, is now enjoy-
ing the second of the two alternatives.
Victoria, since the overthrow of the Gillies-
Deakin boom Cabinet, and New South
Wales are in the anarchistic stage. In the
latter province nothing of the slightest public
value has been accomplished for the past
eight years, and during the last four or five
sessions even the hope and pretence of doing
anything seem to have been abandoned.
The Tory press habitually charges the re-
sponsibility for this state of things upon the
Labour Party, but the falsehood of this
accusation is so apparent that it hardly needs
to be refuted. The New South Wales
Labour Party is the only one which has
never attempted to grab at office—which has
never wasted time over want-of-confidence
motions—which has never been an element
of disorder but always one of order. The
final disorganisation of the Legislature dates
from the troubled times of the Stuart and
Jennings-Dibbs Cabinets, when the Foreign-
trade party gave itself up to utter black-
guardism, and the lamented Gibbes, M.L.A.,
occupied the Speaker’s chair with a waste-
paper basket on his head in lieu of a wig,
and when Neild took to making nine-hour
speeches, and Robertson poured forth his
resources of bullock-driving eloquence, and
Parkes blasphemed at the Premier, and the
whole Opposition swore, and yelled, and
cursed, and spat, and drank, and committed
violent assaults, and raised weird and horrible
cat-choruses for 12 months at a stretch.
The system of Party Government reached its
fullest development of uselessness in these
days—the tide rose to high garbage mark,
and, despite an occasional transient ebb and
flow, there has been but little variation ever
since.
# * *
The Bibbs Government—like the Parkes
Government which preceded it—has ob-
viously given up attempting to do anything
save hanging on to its billet, and its hopes in
that direction are not very high. All the old
parliamentarians now practically accept the
inevitable, and expect nothing in order that
they may not be disappointed—it is only
such novices as Shiels, of Victoria, who
come into office with an inflated idea of
doing something great and noble, and leaving
a No. 19 footprint on the sands of politics,
and because Siuels aimed higher than the
majority he fell all the lower and the more
hopelessly. The only country where Party
Government now bear’s any semblance of
practicability is Britain, and it is practicable
there only because the Commons consists, to
all intents and purposes, of Gladstone and
another man, and their followers are dialled
into such absolute obedience that, on all
party questions, they are mere dummies
who might as well leave their px-oxies and
stay away for the rest of their lives. In
other words, Party Government succeeds
only because Parliamentary Government has
been, to all intents and purposes, abolished,
and, except when a great malcontent like
Parnell rises to the surface of events, the
country is run by two practically irrespon-
sible despots.

If Australia is so deeply devoted to the
old British fetich of Government by Con-
tradiction that it must needs maintain the
venerable incubus regardless of cost, it
might at least be well to devise some modifi-
cation whereby the cumbrous scheme would
be x’endered a little more workable. One
idea which here suggests itself is that the
Legislature should be elected in duplicate.
The duplicate House would contain a
Government and an Opposition and a
Hansard, and all the other necessaries, and
the salaries would be the same as in the
original Chamber. In it all the questions
would be asked, and the personal explanations
made, and there would be a motion for
adjournment every night, and a want-of-
confidence motion once a week, and every-
body who had a personal grievance would be
allowed to bring it up there, and everybody
who had a log to roll would roll it there,
and everybody who wanted a money vote
would get it, and everybody would bo
allowed to call everybody else a liar.
All the members would talk as long as
they pleased. There would be the annual
financial statement, and the usual big
deficiency, and the usual loan would Re
agreed upon to cover the deficiency ; and
the Ministry would have an alleged
policy, and would abandon it after the
customary fashion, and the House would
pass bills, and decide great public
questions, and its proceedings would be
duly reported in the papers just the
same as if it were a i*eal Legislature, and any
member, or editor, or private citizen who
ventured to cast discredit on it, and suggest
that it wasn’t real, should be promptly sent
to gaol for three months, in order to keep
up the public respect for parliamentary in-
stitutions. And the only unreal part of the
business would be that the laws made by the
duplicate Parliament would not be enforced,
and its loans would never be floated, and the
financial statement would refer to imaginary
cash supposed to be in an imaginary Trea-
sury, and nothing would be genuine save
the rows and the stonewalling and the
salaries. The duplicate Parliament would
be provided as a safety-valve for the ventila-
tion of real and imaginary grievances, and a
place for Legislative execration. And, mean-
while, the genuine Assembly would conduct
its proceedings in solemn silence. Nobody
would utter a sound except the individual
addressing the House, and even he would
only be permitted to speak for five minutes.
Nobody would be allowed to move an ad-
journment or a want-of-confidence resolu-
tion, or to make any personal explanation,
or to ask any questions, except in writing,
or to howl or execrate, or to be absent
without leave, under pain of a heavy
fine. In short, as Parliament has not
sufficient time both to legislate and to exe-
crate, and as, for many years past, it has
attended strictly to execration and allowed
legislation to slide, therefore the work would
be divided, so that any member who must
make a scene or burst could proceed to the
duplicate Assembly and make his scene
there, and then come back refreshed and
attend to business once more.
# # #
The only other visible alternative, if Party
Government is to continue, is the sub-divi-
sion of the Assembly into committees some-
what after the plan of the U.S. Congress.
One of these might have sole charge of the
finances, another of public works, a third
might deal with all general measures and
amend, pass, or reject them as it thought
best, and the fourth could devote itself
entirely to questions, motions, general
obstruction, objurgation, and putting out
the Government. Then the decisions of the
committees could be affirmed or negatived
by the whole House without debate, and
thereby the Legislature might at length
succeed in accomplishing something for the
good of the country at large. Failing some
such remedy as this, however, Government
by Contradiction must come to an end at an
early date. If the nation will not adopt the
only remedy which has yet presented itself—
the election of Ministers by the House
for a fixed period—-then Parliament, out
of its own uselessness, will probably die a
natural death. The evil will grow and in-
crease till the Legislature ceases even the
pretence of doing anything, and it will be
left to sit and babble unheeded in its deceased
and unburied condition while the Ministry
runs the State by itself, and the National
Ass and the Trades and Labour Council, or
some similar combinations, take turns at
being the power behind the throne, accord-
ing to the fortune of war or the assumed
sentiments of the Cabinet in office. Mean-
while New South Wales has almost ceased to
care whether the Dibbs Government remains
in office or the Paekes Government rises in
its stead. Ministries in Australia are all
very much alike. They have different pro-
grammes, but as no one of them ever gets a
chance to carry out its programme the ulti-
mate difference is not perceptible. More-
over, very few of them desire to carry out
their programmes. They live by promising
reforms in the blessed certainty that they
would never be allowed to execute them
even if they so desired. In most cases they
do not so desire, but if they did they would
end in dust and ashes just the same.
PLAIN ENGLISH.
On “Esquires” and Other Matters.
Nelson P. Whitelocke, of the Bathurst
National Advocate, an English gentleman, is
obviously feeling ill over' The Bulletin’s
announcement in a recent issue that it proposes
for the future to disregard all Imperial titles
held by Australians. He is a confused indi-
vidual and his woes are difficult to sort out.
The following are a few of Mr. Whitelocke’s
troubles :
When the Sovereign of the Empire has given a subject
a title why should Tin; Bulletin, which circulates by
virtue of registration of the oath of the proprietors to
remain loyal to that Sovereign, refuse to recognise it?
The Bulletin doesn’t circulate by virtue of
any such “ oath,” and has never sworn to be
loyal to any Sovereign, so the Advocate man
is out. It circulates because the public find it
worth buying; if it weren’t worth buying a
whole cartload of oaths wouldn't make it circu-
late. Again :
The Bulletin is thoroughly Australian in. its knowledge
of British social degrees, which means it has little or no
knowledge of them at all. It will, for instance, speak of
the Sovereign of England as “The Queen,” instead of as
“Her Majesty”; and of the Emperor of Germany as
“His Imperial Majesty,” instead of the German Emperor.
The Bulletin does not speak of Victoria as
the “ Queen,” it only speaks of her as “ Queen
Victoria.” If Nelson P. Whitelocke pro-
poses to deny that she is Queen Victoria, then
he had belter do it at his own risk. But this
paper doesn’t allude to her as the “ Sovereign
of England,” seeing that no such title has been
in existence for many generations ; though it
will allude to her that way any time it chances
to feel so inclined. Also, it doesn’t speak of
William of Germany as an “ Imperial Majesty.”
Some more:
The title “enjoyed” by Sir Henry Parkes is just as
much a title in Australia as in England ; every hit as
much a knighthood in British New Guinea as in the
British London ; and a knighthood of England wherever
England’s flag may fly.
Quite so, and if Parkes “ enjoyed ” a boil
instead of a title, it would be a boil not only
all over the British empire, but all over the
world as well. Therefore, if a knighthood is
honourable because it holds good throughout
the empire, a boil is more honourable still,
because it is absolutely cosmopolitan. All the
same, Parkes isn’t a knight of “ England,’
and “England’s” flag doesn’t fly anywhere
Apparently, Whttelocke doesn’t know the
difference between England and the United
Kingdom. Further :
It (The Bulletin) seems to forget that we are not in
dependent, but simply subject to the Throne of England.
We are not. There is no “ Throne of England,’’
but Whitelocke’s history is so loose that he
isn’t aware of the fact. Again :
In those days we will, no doubt, be in a position to
allowTiiE Bulletin or any other paper, to swear allegiance
to the Commonwealth only ; and then, doubtless, the little
pieces that fall into the pockets of the republican pro-
prietors will have something on them suggestive that the
Republic will live long and flourish. At present, we must
all accept them stamped with “ Victoria Dei Gratia."
The Bulletin would respectfully reply just
here that most of the money that comes its way
has nothing about “ Victoria dei Gratia ” on it,
but bears the autograph of a potentate who
seems to be called the “Bank of New Zealand.”
1 hat is a mere detail, however. Mr. White-
LOCKE winds up with the following burst :
“Mr.” is a title of courtesy in most cases, and in certain
others in Great Britain it is, when spelt out, hereditary •
whilst the same thing npplits to “Esquire a title that
is the right of English barristers, sheriffs, and magistrates
on llieir attaining those dignities, but which is more
properly the right of gentlemen of English birth whose
forefathers were “gentle ” by law and who are by reason
of the registration of t ieir families in the Heralds’ Court
entitled to bear those families’ arms—not crests-and’
therefore, assume the dignity of “Esquires.” It may be
a silly thing to observe all these things, but whilst we
live under the Crown that rests thereon, we must observe
the authority, and, what’s more, we can all do that with-
out the slightest saorifii e of our republican desires or our
democratic aspirations.
The Bulletin cheerfully endorses one of Mr,
Whitelocke’s statements, anyhow—it is a
“silly thing” to worry about crests and
armorial bearings and wild beasts rampant and
the like—more than that, it is childish, idiotic,
and supremely ludicrous, and in any case the
“ Crown doesn’t rest “ thereon ” —it might as
well try to rest on a rainbow. Also, Mr.
Whttelocke has considerably mixed up his list
of “esquires,” from which The Bulletin
suspects that he got his alleged information
out of the eneyclopiedia, and inadvertently
strayed into the adjacent article on “Esqui-
maux. However, the difference between an
“esquire” and an Esquimaux is of such small
importance that this discrepancy really doesn’t
matter.
1 hat old-established citizen, “John Smith,”
of Congewoi, writes to Sydney Telegraph to
point out that the N.S. W. education system is
a hideous disgrace to the country at large,
John Smith’s view of the case is so refreshingly
novel as to be worth quoting :
I read your remarks in yesterday’s paper about our
State schools ; this is, I know, a sacred subject, which can
only be mentioned with bated breath, lest the Kiama
ghost should “appear,” as he often did, when the pet
hact had been in danger. For years it has been evi-
dent that the weight of this iniquitous measure would
drag it down, and surely now, when public dishonour is
staring us in the face, we should look at the matter from
a common-sense point of v iew. The system costs now
about ±11,000,000 yearly to educate about 50,000
children—say, ±2O uer head, and it is well known that our
wealthiest people educate their “curled darlings ” at our
high schools ; even our “poor working man,” if he could
do with less beer and tobacco, should'pay for the educa-
tion of his children. We are making paupers of our
people, and, what is worse, the whole scheme was started
in avowed bigotry or hostility to one section of our people,
and since then it has, with the Kiama ghost, been fastened
on us to our utter disgrace.
In the first place, the New South Wales school
system costs just about £750,000 for the educa-
tion of nearly 200,000 (not 50,000) scholars ;
cost per head, about £4 (instead of £2O) per
annum. And if the “ people ” don’t pay this
along with the rest of the taxes then who on
earth does ? The maniacal Smith evidently
thinks that the money comes from some out-
side source, and that a pauperised nation is
being educated out of charity. Possibly he
fancies that Queen Victoria stands the racket.
People like Smith always travel on the assump-
tion that the “ working man’s ” inordinate con-
sumption of beer and tobacco is the cause of
all his troubles, and that if he gave up these
soul-destroying commodities everything would
be well. But as, in the present case, the “ work-
ing-man ’ pays most religiously for his children’s
education the sneer falls flat, and only helps to
display the wretched Smith’s ignorance. When
that individual asserts that “ we are making
paupers of the people it would almost seem as
if he imagined that he paid the hill himself,
and that he (Smith) was not a part of the
people but a separate and distinct institution.
The spectacle of Smith making paupers of the
people is touching, hut as the people are equally
making a pauper of Smith that citizen should
lie low. Who is Conger-eel Smith, anyhow ?
“ Timotheus, ’ in the Argus, drivels concerning
“ the subtle intellect ” of Shiels, and yet sym-
pathises with the member who interrupted
Shiels* dying speech by requesting him not to
talk “rot. Unquestionably the ex-Victorian
Premier talked “ rot” under the delusion that
he was wise as a serpent. His cheap reputation
for cleverness and culture had been taken
seriously by the weak young man, and his
belie! that he confounded the politics of his
opponents witli Latin quotations which they
didn’t understand was quite sincere. But
nothing about Shiels not even Ids conceit—
seemed subtle. As a shuffler he was absurdly
shallow, as a talker he always suggested the*
aspiring tutor who had plodded through
volumes of debates until he felt qualified to’
take a class in oratory. He aimed at being a
diplomatist, and took infinite pains to make a
mysterious mess of everything lie dealt with.
If Shiels ever tried to see a month in front of
him he can have no perceptive power whatever,
for he was invariably unprepared for difficulties
as they came in their due course. His chances
were so many and so showy, he might so easily
have taken a commanding lead in a halt and
maimed Parliament, that his abject failure
can’t bo ascribed to want of pluck, or experi-
ence, or want of anything except ready wits.
False surveys, forged records, suborned and
scoundrelly Consuls, in collusion with lying
interpreters—these things explain the raison
d’etre of the Treaty Powers’ Land Commission
in Samoa. By last mail we are told that
30,000 acres have reverted to the natives. The
history of the earth greed in the Navigators is
that of Maoriland, of the American Indians, of
the Zulus. A native of Samoa, eager to buy a


breech-loader, sells, as he thinks, a small portion
only of his inheritance to some cunning white
trader or trading firm. Nine chances to one
he sold without the consent of other members
of his family. That does not matter, as he will
keep it secret. The buyer and the Consul
concur (we. are speaking of from 1870 to 1880)
and he signs the transfer, which is carefully
read over to him. Then he departs and the
“true and proper record ” is written out by these
heartless swindlers whereby the ten acres poor
Taualoa has parted with at Falifa or Falealili
are made a hundred. Then he is told to call
next day, bring witnesses, and get his money.
They come, and are also asked to witness the
transfer, and the precious deed is then duly
recorded in the consular archives. And as
things were in those days in Samoa, so are they
now in the New Hebrides. Soon there may be
a Land Commission there, and then will be
revealed the same villainy, forgery and anointed
scoundrelism. But in the New Hebrides the
purchasers are not obscure traders, but “verra
respectable” Australian citizens. The black-
labour land-boom has not come off there as yet,
and so the land remains in its primeval state,
but the robbers that “ bought ” it are eagerly
awaiting it. And perhaps it will come, but
with it a Land Commission and—collapse and
exposure.

The “ New Australia ” people, having sensibly
given up the Argentine deserts as hopeless, are
now reported to have obtained a free grant of
some 230,000 acres of at least reasonably good
land in Paraguay. If this information is strictly
true, the prospects for the Australian emigrants
—not for the Australians that are left behind—
are a good deal improved by the change. Para-
guay was a tolerably prosperous country in
days gone by, and has had fewer revolutions
than any other South American republic. When
it started its career as an independent state,
Feancia promptly set up as Dictator, and held
the post unchallenged for 26 years. He was
about the most wonderful tyrant that the
nineteenth century has produced ; he permitted
no Paraguayan to go abroad, and arrested—
and generally executed every prospector,
land - boomer, missionary or other stranger
who entered the country. Also, he established
so wonderfully elaborate a spy system that a
man could hardly even think evil of Feaxgia’s
policy without dying shortly afterwards. All
the same he made the country prosperous, and
died at the age of 84, much regretted. Carlos
Lopez gently annexed his situation in 1844,
and held it with a strong hand for 18 years.
During his time, Paraguay continued to
prosper, and it was a good land for anyone who
didn’t criticise the Government. His son and
successor, Solano Lopez, was a madman, a
drunkard, a frantic murderer, and a sincere
Christian “according to his lights.” He
started a war against Brazil and Argen-
tina, and in the course of five years
Paraguay lost nearly half its territory,
and most of its male population, its towns were
reduced to ashes, and utter ruin was every-
where. Since that time the little State has
wanted men more than anything else, and it is
quite possible that it will welcome any number
of New Australians so long as they help to
build up its shattered prospects and get things
ready, so that the little fire-eating nation may
make a good show in the next war. And when
they start Griffith will go down to the wharf
to see them off, and the Kanakas and the
Chinamen and the cheap Italians and the
coolies will all wish them “ Godspeed ! ”

The New South Wales public-school teacher
now enjoys two years of University life at the
expense of the State. This, it was thought,
would cure him of his excessive pedantry, that
instead of being a man among children and a
child among men he would become a person of
liberal thought and common-sense behaviour.
It was thought that two years daily intercourse
with real University students, the most
democratic youths in the world, would rid him
of those characteristics which expose him at
once to the contempt of his acquaintances and
the derision of his enemies. The result has
not been answerable to the design. Attached
from infancy to one set of persons and one set
of ideas, saturated with an unreasonably exag-
gerated respect for constituted authority, he
finds, when atthe University, that he has nothing
in common with the majority of students. The
inevitable result is that he segregates—he
herds with his kind alone. He and his
fellows carry with them into the Univer-
sity their small primary-school ideas, and
thus intensify that mean, petty, pedagogic spirit
which the regulation was intended to combat.
Before obtrusive, that spirit now becomes
aggressive. He imports his feeble Latinity into
his ordinary conversation. In the tram he
exposes the small section of Cicero he stumbles
through in a year, and blatantly informs his
bored fellow- passengers that he has a whole
Alexandrian library like that to get through.
In his holidays he haunts Schools of Arts, and
indites vapid commentaries on the margins of
periodicals. Also, he generally acts as if the
■whole fabric of the universe were centred in him.
At an expense of £5OOO New South Wales
yearly ejects 30 of these horrid bores upon
suffering humanity.

It is alleged that the Dibbs (N.S.W.) Govern-
ment, having pledged itself by way of adver-
tisement to sundry reforms which it would be
very sorry to see carried out, is now reduced
to putting up its own followers to stonewall its
own measures for fear they should be passed by
accident. Whether the allegation is true or
not, the proceeding is believed to be by no
means uncommon in Australia. Under
such circumstances a strong and thoroughly
coherent Opposition, led by a really strong
chief, could make dreadful embarrassment for
the Ministry. It only requires to enter into a
conspiracy of silence—to roll up in all its
voting power every night, but to say nothing—
to make no speeches, never to move the adjourn-
ment of the House, to propose no want of confi-
dence motions, to ask no questions except such
as are absolutely essential, to make one man do
any speaking that is necessary in the way of
moving amendments, and to restrict him to 15
minutes every night, to make it a cast-iron
rule that all the rest of the eloquence of the
Opposition shall not occupy more than another
15 minutes, to sit in grim silence when anybody
heaves insults at them, to vote solid against
every attempt at early adjournment, and to
yell, “ Go on !” with one voice whenever the
Government shows signs of flagging. And
then the miserable Cabinet would have to do
its own stonewalling, and to do it openly and
glaringly, and have to block its own measures,
and get its own supporters to oppose it, while
a hyena-like laugh would go up from the
Opposition benches.
May not this be written of Queensland by
the future historian :
Slavery was introduced at an early date and flourished.
The result of this influence was to develops in the South
(read North) a system of large, ill-worked manors or
estates. The predominance of slave-labour discouraged
the immigration of free labour, and the South (read
North) remained comparatively thinly settled. The
moral effect of slavery upon the white population was
bad. Habits of thriftlessness and laziness were engen-
dered among the free population, and their social relations
corrupted.— Westel W. Willoughby: “ Government and
Administration of the United States.”
When Minister Lyne, N.S.W. , goes out of
office, his successor should obtain an Executive
Council minute that Mr. Lyne’s pet valuator
should not again be employed while land-valuer
Thompson and his expensive valuation staff
remain on the Government pay-rolls. Either
Thompson is superfluous or it is a scandal to
employ the other man. By the way, the full
value of an Executive Council minute as a means
for trammelling the hands of a successor in Minis-
terial office has never been sufficiently appreciated
in N.S.W, In another province, though, its force
has been quite understood and applied.
According to a workers’ authority :
A cablegram from the New Australia prospectors states
that the forty leagues (230,400 acres) secured are in
Paraguay, lat. 25deg. 70min. S. (sic) and lon. 56deg.
50min. W. This is exact. The adjoining forty leagues
(230,400 acres) have been also promised to the association.
The land is free of charge on settlement conditions, near
navigable water and described as “splendid land, well
watered and timbered.”
25deg. 70min.! It sounds like 195 minutes past 13.
And in any case the place described is only a
“point” on the map, and 230,400 acres can’t be
crowded into something that has neither length
nor breadth.
The S.M. Herald prides itself on having
discovered that State services in railways, post
and telegraph matters are not wholly socialistic,
indeed, the Herald says that they are not
socialistic at all. The Herald, as usual, is just
half right. Such enterprises are socialistic in so
far as they are founded and carried on at public
expense, and because the returns go into the State
purse. They are not socialistic because the wages
of those employed thereon are very unequal and
do not rise or fall with increase of profits, or
otherwise. But, above all, they are not socialistic
because the increase of values given to privately-
owned land by such public expenditures invariably
goes into the pocket of its owner and never into
the purse of those—the entire community—re-
sponsible for its creation.
A cable tells us how a Mauritius loan of
<£ooo,ooo, bearing only 3 per cent., has been
subscribed for eight times over at an average of
<£los. Doubtless the Property organs are pre-
pared to raise hosannas over this. Yet what does
it really mean ? That slavery, as a money-making
institution, is one of the revered idols of Britain.
Mauritius depends chiefly on sugar-growing, and
its sugar is cultivated by “cheap and reliable ”
Coolie slaves. For similar greedy reasons, Queens-
land sugar-planters want to run their province
with Kanaka slaves. If the Kanaka slave once
became the recognised staple labourer of the
North, Queensland debentures would probably go
up and its loans would be hungered after ; but the
white worker would have to disappear from the
land. Successful loans abroad bring no happiness
to the workers in Australia, no food to their
homes, no money to their pockets. The fat man
gets fatter and more oppressive. That is all.
This is indeed almost a truth—abolish loans and
you abolish poverty. Work it out by process of
inversion.
Editor Bulletin, —Mr. J. A. Andrews’
attempt to prove Communism and Anarchy
to be identical cults afforded me much
interest, inasmuch as he came very near success.
There is, however, this vital and irreconcileable
divergence between them— i.c., that while both
aim at the perfection of individual autonomy in
society, the Anarchist, as the representative of
the strong, self-confident, egoistic and reckless
members of the community, considers that each
individual would obtain the maximum of pleasure
derivable in this life as an independent free lance.
The Communist, representing the cautious, altru-
istic, and lymphatic temperament, holds that
only by a series of periodical comparisons and dis-
cussions re his views and those of his more
vigorous (and possibly less scrupulous) fellows,
after which a common policy could be decided
on, would his ends best be served. The outcome
of Anarchy would be the formation of innumer-
able syndicates of persons agreed on certain lines
of action, among which the interests of the weaker
portions of society would receive no consideration
whatever. Certainly there would be no written
laws to oppress, but the unwritten ones— i.e., the
fluctuating and irregular desires of the various
syndicators—would probably soon reduce society to
the depths of barbarism. —Yours, &0., Charles
JUNOR.
The eternal conflict between the Eatans-
will Gazette and its foe, the Independent, was
a bright and sparkling matter compared with the
latest outbreak of hostilities on the fiscal question
between the Age and the Argus. The two ,
“great ” Melbourne papers roll heavy, lumbering
articles on the fiscal question at one another, and
on one and the same > morning the unfortunate
constant reader is called upon to dodge such
missiles as these: “Refutation of Freetrade
Statements” (from the Age). “The Freetrade
organ in Melbourne, which during the last few
weeks has been attacking the protective system of
the colony, has apparently experienced consider-
able difficulty in supporting its cause, and has
been driven to make wild and inaccurate state-
ments.” And so on for 2£ cols, concerning the
boot industry. “Protection Pantomimes ” (the
Argus) ; “ The interesting imitation of the Xmas
pantomime is still on show- in the pages of your
monopolist contemporary. The mental contor-
tions, enlivened by stale jokes and startling
assertions ” —and so on for 2 cols, of triumphant
“ refutation ” of Protectionist maundering. It is
an awful thing, this interchange of scorn a,nd
contumely by morning journals, both of which
might more usefully employ their nughty intellects
on the mystery of the Arms and Legs, or minute
details of the latest thing in indecent assaults.
If the Argus and Age must rage together, why
can’t they have it out over murder cases, allowing
their respective special reporters to controvert the
other theory as to the exact causes that led up to
the corpse? An argument wherein one organ dis-
cusses boots whilst the other goes back to the
Corn Laws, is but a sorry contribution towards
the education of a young country. Indeed, it is a
shocking waste of animosity. Now, why doesn’t
the Argus publish a daily list of the Protectionist
members who were drunk in the ’Ouse overnight?
Then the Age would call attention to the fact
that another Freetrade legislator had secretly
compounded with his creditors, and the public
might soon discover which kind of settled policy
was best for trade.
We Want to See the Will.
(FOR THE BULLETIN.)
Once, Adam had to delve the ground, and sweat
was on his brow,
But that was ere he multiplied—there’s quite a
diff’rence now,
For Adam only worked to live, and now it seems
to be—
Some only live to work, and some just live to look
and see.
If Adam only worked to live, it’s plain enough
that we
Should only have to do the same and be like him
as free
To work and live, or loaf and die, to feel life was
worth living.
Or not, just as our conscience took the gift some
god was giving.
If Adam’s sons have got his right to work on earth
and live,
What means this sick’ning cry we hear so many
of them give—
A cry to be allowed to work, a prayer from man
to man,
A breath, but what a hell on earth that breath —
for some—can fan !
That legacy that Adam left—the sweat upon the
brow—
Is more than his executors grant all his offspring
now.
A force is slowly pressing out the men who live to
toil,
Like horses, for their fault’s the same—their food
1 _• costs more than oil.
What makes some people stand upon their hinder
legs and say,
“Free Competition and Freetrade will give us
work alway,”
When ey’ry year “so much ” per cent, of all the
human race
Is now supplying more than full per cent, can
well displace ?
There’s something that we have to-day, that Adam
never had,
A trouble that he never knew, his sons have got it
bad,
For Adam had no rent to pay—the earth was all
his own—
His big estate was left entailed, and so the trouble
sown.
We want to see the title-deeds tlvit Adam left
behind,
We think there’s been some swindling done —we’re
hung’ring just to find
If ever Adam’s will was proved, and if it’s not
the truth
He left a hunk of Windsor Park to be submerged
by Booth.
We want to know if Coopers have the right to
close in land
With simple hoops of legal tape, and where on
earth we’ll stand

The statue of Peter Lalor, presented to the
city of Ballarat, has been so placed as to overlook
the field of Eureka. It suffers in comparison with
the other local statues by having far too low a
pedestal.
Jacob, Chairman of Committees in N.S.W.
Legislative Council, has a distressing voice. The
voice of Jacob is the voice of a saw.
Dixon, who has been steward of the Park-
side (S.A.) Lunatic Asylum for 23 years, has not
during that time slept one night away from the
institution.
An enterprising Parramattan has an-
nounced his intention of starting a temperance
home for the reception of destitute and retrenched
civil servants.
“ E. T. Penfold ” exaltedly appeals to the
readers of Sydney D.T. that, “in thankful recog-
nition of our bountiful harvests (N.S.W.) we offer
up our ebenezers.” No real pietist was ever yet a
humorist. Heaven must be a dull place.
The 400 odd French deputies who refused
to bite at the Panama bribe bait were mostly the
poorer members of the Chamber, ic is said. Living
well within their modest means they could better
afford to be honest than could the “representa-
tive” persons, who are “ repreeentative ” just as
long as they incur heavy social expenses.
Captain F. C. Rowan, Australian repre-
sentative of the Brush Electric Co,, who recently
died at Melbourne, was born in 1844, in Antrim,
Ireland, was educated for the army at Woolwich,
and in ’G3 joined the 59th regt., at Aldershot.
In ’64 he joined the 43rd Light Infantry,
and went to Maoriland where he served with
bravery and distinction during the war, and
saw a great deal of active service. He led the ,
attack to the right, on Te-Ngatu-o-te-rnanu.
Major Von Tempsky, Capt. Buck, Capt. Palmer,
Lieuts. Hastings and Hunter were killed during ,
the action, and while carrying the latter under
fire, Capt. Rowan was severely wounded by a
bullet which shattered the left jaw, cut through
the muscles under the tongue and made its exit at
the right side of the neck. In 1877 became to Mel-
bourne where he engaged in engineering pursuits.
Ho afterwards assumed the management of the
Australasian Electric Light Co,, and subsequently
became the representative throughout Australasia
of the Brush Electric and Engineering Co. He
left Sydney in good health on 2nd Dec., but
caught a severe cold on the overland journey; ■
acute pneumonia set in and he died on the ilth. He ■
married that well-known painter and popular lady,
Marion Ellis Ryan, eldest daughter of Charles
Ryan, of Derroweit, Macedon, Vic., and leaves one
son, Eric, aged 16. He held the post of Consul-
General for Denmark for many years and ;
took the keenest interest in all literary and i
artistic pursuits. He wrote and spoke well, !
was a generous man in thought and action, a keen
sportsman and an accomplished athlete. In his *1
own regiment he went by the name of “Hercules.” 51

My Dear Moorabinda —
Apropos of the all-absorbing topic—the resigna-
tion and departure of the Jerseys—we have had
columns about Gov. Jersey’s reasons for going
away, but nobody tells us specifically what every-
body is literally dying to know—why Lady Jersey
is packing her bag? One can see many water-
tight reasons why Lady Jersey should gather her
chickens around her and fly to a safer clime.
“Yillars”is getting a big boy now, and will be
legally qualified to marry a chorus-girl in a very
short while—therefore, it is unsafe to have him
lying about loose for any designing Nobody to
pick up and appropriate. Tottie—her ladyship
probably argues—you have always with you,
wherever you go, but her well-known wiles are
not half so dangerous in a wide atmosphere as the
possibly original arts exercised in our Little
Pedlington by some attractive Miss Impossible or
other, who has to be given the run of the premises.
And then, there are demure, light-haired Jersey
girls to be reckoned with. You can’t bring up
your daughters in an absolutely friendless state,
and Lady J.’s experiences of the barn-dancing
coterie (about whom, en parenthese, many new and
shocking stories continually crop up), made her
shy of “colonial” girl-friendships for her duck-
lings. So, as their frocks are creeping downwards,
it is time to transplant them to a land where
young ladies don’t break loose so unmistakeably—
and, besides, isn’t it just possible, in the opinion
of the worldly-wise, that Australia is too many
thousands of miles away from the marriage-market
for the mother of a girl of sixteen ? Lady Jersey’s
reasons for leaving this horrid country would be
far more to the point than Lord Jersey’s defunct
agent—which interesting corpse has, of course,
Kot about as much to do with it as a dead donkey
has with the morning coffee and toast of yours
truly.
There is at least one vice-regal entertainer who
can bear the early departure of the Jerseys with
great fortitude, and that is the unhappy individual
who entertained young Lord Viiliers at his
country residence for a little shooting. The host
—so the story goes—had a couple of pet kangaroos.
On the first morning the energetic Viscount spied
these innocents at their gambols, and thinking
that all marsupials were game in Australia, mis-
took them for prey.
To hunt up “my gun ” and start in hot pursuit
was the work of an instant, and as the tame
animals were accustomed to regard man with an
unsuspicious eye the victim just sat upon his tail
and folded ins forepaws complacently while Lord
V. took deadly aim and bagged bis host’s pet
wallaby in the click of a trigger. The scene that
followed is easily imagined—and peace was only
restored by an effusive letter full of “ so sorry’s ”
and “very much regrets,” backed up by the gift
of another kangaroo, broken in to lawn-work, to
take the slaughtered innocent’s place.
Judging by the fatal aptitude for potting
confiding domestic animals (probably because
they don’t bother your aim by running away)
displayed by visitors from ’Ome who are given
the freedom of a gun—it would not be a bad
plan for the Australian host to hang tags on to bis
livestock, from the family cow to the chickens (or
even to the baby and the cockatoo in the cage and
the family dog). “Please Don’t Shoot,” or “ Be-
ware of the Pet,” ought to give pause to the
densest sportsman who ever drew a bead on a bay-
stack.
The early departure of the Jerseys for the land
from whence they came but two short years ago,
isn’t by any means an unexpected calamity. For
one thing, their sightseeing was too indefatigable
for people who intended to stay the whole period.
When you come to calmly look at it, there are
many less pleasant ways of doing Australia
than by occupying a Government House for a
year or so and radiating round—and the Jerseys’
plan, accidental or otherwise, is worth the notice
of the itinerant aristocrats who are dying to
“do” us and don’t want to be entirely at the
mercy of the Australian hotels.
For my part, I think a frequent shuffle of
Governors would be the very thing to sustain
public interest in Government House and keep
things lively all round. There are certain people
who never get on paste-board terras with vice-
royalty, but who always live in hope—and to such
each new and unsuspecting potentate is a field of
unlimited social possibilities. Nothing much
comes of him as a general thing, because somebody
always interprets the visitors’ book for the new
secretary’s benefit, but he keeps a lot of people up
to concert-pitch until he’s given a ball or two. It
is always interesting to watch the manoeuvring.
Sydney “Ministering Children’s League”—the
title of which alone is calculated to turn out more
prigs than a pattern ladies’ seminary—held a
meeting recently, when it appeared that the
League is in great going order. “ This great
growth of enthusiasm in the work,” it candidly
confesses, “is attributable, in a large measure, to
the visit of the Countess of Meath.” How
familiar that sounds ! The St. John’s Ambulance
movement filled the country with reckless maidens
who smashed their umbrellas into splints on the
slightest provocation—because Lady Brassey bad
a fad that way. Lady Carington got up a howling
enthusiasm for the Women’s Jubilee Fund and
every second girl you met was “collecting ” while
little Lady C. actively mothered the idea—but
isn’t it rather sickening to find that even the
babes and sucklings regulate the fervour of their
crazes according to the titles in the prospectus ?
It detracts a great deal from their philanthropy
that they should only rally round the League
because a Countess had a hand in it —and, viewed
in that light, the statement that 731 articles of
apparel were cobbled and so many worn clothes
patched by the League has no charitable signi-
ficance whatsoever. Those rags were constructed
and mended not for the poor and seedy, but for
the Countess of Meath. The Ministering Children
are being trained, not as angels of mercy, but as
poisonous little snobs.
Miss Helen Dight, who, together with the
amiable and popular Mrs. E. M. Mort, was so un-
fortunately drowned at Bodalla, last week, was
probably the most strikingly handsome belle of
Sydney society. She would indeed have made an
excellent representative of an Australian type of
beauty. At the Sydney balls last year she looked
a veritable queen among the somewhat squat and
dumpy damsels whose names may be seen hustling
for the very front places in the fashion reports
Why don’t women leave well alone? Ere the
female-suffragists began to insist upon feminine
brilliancy men took us sugar-coated, and perhaps
were ready to believe that we were like the
monkeys—full of unrevealed possibilities concealed
for diplomatic reasons. But since my dear sisters
have gone in for public undertakings and got into
the most hopeless tangles in the process, it has
gradually become a painful and evident fact that
women on the average don’t go much deeper than
the surface, and can impress men far mo«e effec-
tually by lying low and simply trying to look
clever.
The fact that a well-known Sydney Judge has
had to give his lOU for the whole of the sub-
scribers’ money in a recent feminine undertaking
encourages me to advance the above heresy.
There was a long subscription-list on which Mrs.
Blank wrote herself down for two figures, and
Miss Blank was very liberal on paper—but col-
lecting-day told another tale, and there was abso-
lutely no money to pay the piper ! Not, mind
you, that I blame the committee for piling all the
damages on to a man. Woman has been taught
to regard him merely as a creature with an auto-
matic arm for sliding in and out of his pocket, and
she is only obeying her inherited instincts when
she “goes through him ” like a bushranger. But
I do think the untrammelled female who cuts
an independent dash to show the superfluity of
the masculine half of creation ought not—no,
she really ought not —to fall back upon him in
the old, old way when the bill comes in.
Sydney Turf Club races, at Rand wick, on Anni-
versary Day, were a very lively episode, although
the M.S. attendance would have stood a little
thickening and the stand was overrun with
infants. “Is it a racecourse or a day-nursery?”
asked a Melbourne visitor, and really when it
comes to a baby-in-anns propping itself up on its
two bandy legs and applying a huge pair of race-
glasses to its fishy eye, one has a conviction that
“infants in arms not admitted” might have a
beneficial effect writ large over the gate—if only
to postpone the advent of the “ Baby Bookmaker”
or the “Juvenile Juggins” hypothecating his
rattle or teething-ring to “put something on the
j'Rger.”
Mrs. Harry Levien wore the most ginger dress
visible. It was a shot opal on a grey ground and
trimmed with effective linings of opal cream lace
applique ; picture bat of black velvet trimmed
with jet buckles and black feathers and a couple
of mauve orchids. Mrs. Sydney Burdekin wore a
grey-greenish “chow” costume trimmed with
cream lace and sash of black moire ; Mrs. (Dr.)
Sly got up a Dresden china effect in pale-grey
with a pink spot and trimming of pale-pink silk
covered with black lace. Miss Burdett-Smith, in
semi-mourning, came with Miss M‘Donagh in
maize mull with a pink pattern, and hat covered
with crushed strawberry feathers. Mrs. S. A.
Moss, recently returned from a trip ’Ome,
sported a well-cut black Bengaline with big sleeves
and yoke of blue silk covered with black lace, hat
cn suite. Myra Kemble had a glove-fit in ecru silk
lustre. The Misses Williamson looked natty in
brown checks, with coarse straw hats trimmed
with ribbons and quills ; but a charming society
girl turned out as yellow as an orange under a
veil of violent violet. The human visage was
never meant to be shrouded in the festive tints of
a chemist’s window, and those who do so do it at
their own risk.
“Uncles and Aunts” was revived at Sydney
“Royal,” last week, in the presence of a well-
dressed circle. There was only one artistic frock
on the stage —Mollie Browne’s tea-gown of yellow
and white. I can’t understand the dressing in
“ Uncle and Aunts ” —in one act one lady is lurid
in red velvet and satin dinner dress—another
sports a tea-gown, and another is in ordinary
morning dress ! Also Harry Hodson’s method of
eating a stage fish was an astonishment —but stage
eaters are proverbially original. They speak with
a full mouth, leave their spoons in their cups—-
and dine in two seconds. Bellew’s “ Scarpia ”
was the only naturally-deliberate feeding man I
have ever seen on the stage.
From W. H. Paling and Co. I have received
two songs in one cover—“ The Course of True
Love,” and “The Vision ’’—music by Frank E.
Down, to words by Heine, “ The Course of True
Love ” is the more successful of the two, but both
are pleasing melodies set for light tenor or mezzo-
soprano voices, and are just the length of the
ideal encore.
The interprovincial cricket-match attracted in-
spiriting crowds to Sydney Association Ground.
The gathering on Anniversary Day was absolutely
phenomenal in size, and last Saturday—the third
day—people hung on to their Members’ Stand
chairs with Melbourne-Cup-like tenacity. A
multitude of gay garments were brought out by
the beautiful day, and the bright, well-kept little
garden “wasn’t in it” for colouring with the
garden of girls—altho’ one of them did look rather
odd with her head tied up like a dumpling in
thick white gauze, and two damsels in skittle-fib
blue and pink of the crudest colour, were dread-
fully like a pair of cheap vases.
Mrs. Brough—who came with Miss Emma
Temple—looked charming in China-blue cashmere
trimmed with black and silver gimp—and black
lace and bonnet. A millionaire’s wife sported
cream silk, draped with biscuit lace and a Tuscan
bonnet—but there was nothing very new on show.
The woi’ld is now knocking down its summer
frock, which generally limp garment hasn’t much
heart in it at the best of times after a day’s wear.
The spectacle of the day was afforded by a gor-
geous male robed in spotless white right down to
his boots, relieved by a crimson silk sash and a
hat-band in three flaring colours. When you had
got over the impression that he was a Cyclorama
“ sandwich ” he looked quite fetching.
“Much Ado About Nothing ” was strictly V.R.
on 27th ult., when Gov. and Lady Jersey turned
up in the curtained square of patronage —where,
by the way, no managerial bouquets were laid on
as a shelter for weary yawning. The white satin
bills —like little bits of rag—were the only differ-
ences observable on the face of the Criterion —
except that I thought I remarked a tendency on
the part of the talented company to slightly bob
—like a devout religionist in front of a crucifix —
towards the vice-regal box on first entering. Lady
Jersey wasn’t particularly smart in pale-blue
brocade —also, she recognised nobody, despite the
fact that one or two matrons made elaborate duck-
ings in her direction and retired hot and disgusted
behind their fans for the rest of the show. If
there is one accomplishment “ M.E. J.” will leave
behind her in these outlandish parts it is the
mesmerised look of an absolutely unseeing eye. It
is rather comical, by the bye, to see the woes of
vice-regal expression pass over the features of
“Society.” When a facially-amiable woman is
lording it over us then everybody grins at you like
a hungry dingo—but when Lady Blank’s working-
day expression only wants two degrees more stoni-
ness to pass for a petrification—why, then you
have your Block peopled with Sphinxes.
By the way, that was rather a blushful accident
which lately happened to a Queensland legal
dignitary as he was publicly—oh, so publicly—
bidding adieu to some ladies who came to see him
off the other day. And the moral of it seems to
me to be —“ Beware of patent braces.”
The engagement of the attractive Miss Nellie
Hill, of Sydney, to Mr. “Jack ” Wagner, of Mel-
bourne, is announced.
Queen Victoria, I read, stood godmother to
Lady Carington’s new baby.
Yours faithfully,
SAPPHO SMITH.

“Falka” departed from Sydney Royal on
Friday night for the place, wherever that place
may be, where the unappreciated comic operas go,
and on Saturday “Uncles and Aunts ” was pre-
sented under the control of a new company. The
new company is apparently run on commonwealth
principles, for all the names on the programme
are printed in the same type, and no one poses as
a particular star in big letters. “Uncles and
Aunts ” is a shadowy and somewhat unsatis-
factory comedy ; it has bursts of wild humour, but
the motive of things isn’t so apparent as it might
be, and the bursts are disconnected, and there
aren’t enough bursts anyway. The audience is
always catching a shadowy glimpse of some-
thing that never developes, like a transient
vision of a camel in a thick fog. There
are fleeting views of a wondrously comic person
named ’Kiah who wants to marry a pretty girl for
no definite reason, and ultimately jilts her for a
swollen old woman and for reasons that are still
less definite. ’Kiah, like the comet, travels very
fast and doesn’t stay long, and for some very in-
adequate cause he tells tremendous lies which only
lead to his immediate discomfiture. There is
also a vague outline of a girl who affects to go
mad in a wildly grotesque fashion but without any
coherent obje it; a bright red uncle who objects to
a marriage trim motives not stated ; an aunt who
objects for no motive at all and who talks in her
sleep, a father who doesn’t turn up, but who is
also understood to object, another uncle who
never appears at all, and yet one more
uncle who, for some purpose that no one
even attempts to define, personates the first uncle,
who is also personated by ’Kiah. There is some-
thing particularly ungraspable about all these
uncles, and the relationship between them and
the two overgrown aunts is slippery and elusive.
Also, on the first night, several members of the
company seemed to suffer from a serious want of
rehearsal, and the cry of the prompter was heard
in the land. Mr. Tom Cannam, however, is ex-
cepted from this reproach ; his 'Kiah is one of the
most brilliant things he has attempted, and if it
was built on the foundations of a more substantial
comedy might almost take rank with the boneless
curate of the “ Private Secretary.” The want of
foundation damages it ; “Uncles and Aunts” is
a comedy that was evidently picked before it was
ripe. Messrs. Leopold and Hodson, two of the
unaccountable uncles, are always reliable and are
calculated to lend strength to any company ; and
Mr. Diver’s expressive eye shows no signs of
decadence, though his character is six sizes, or
more, too small for him. Also, Miss Alice May
fills a fascinating girl-part, and she and Mr.
Leopold share all the applause that is going.
Despite the merits of the company, “Uncles and
Aunts ” isn’t going to have an extended run. Its
one incurable fault is that it doesn’t last long
enough to allow the uncles to explain themselves,
and that ’Kiah is hustled off the stage before he
has time to offer satisfactory cause for his conduct,
while two men who might throw some light on
things never appear at all. One of them sends a

“London Day by Day,” at Sydney Her
Majesty’s, is a bulky and imposing spectacle with
many gorgeous effects, and the usual moral
that the wicked shall be suddenly cut off.
The story is reasonably new, and the characters
are tolerably ancient. There is the inevitable
villain, half-cockney, half Hebraic, who snuffles
comic observations through his nose, and perspires
profusely, and groans piteously in the upper end
of his nasal orifice. Lionel Rignold plays this
part with eclat, but all Lionel’s humour up to
date has been more or less of the costermonger
description, and The Bulletin still waits
anxiously to see him in some character that
doesn’t bear the imprint of Whitechapel. There
is the inevitable villain in evening - dress and
broken English, represented by Albert Nor-
man ; and the massive hero, who is done by
George Rignold. The latter looks in better
health than he did, and plays well, and
is as nervously anxious about his hat as
usual—Mr. Rignold’s hat always weighs on his
mind more or less. The suffering, injured, but
trustful girl is supplied by Miss Hilda Spong, who
looks as pretty as ever; and the deserted wife of
the foreigner with the battered accent and the
evening dress is played effectively by Miss Kate
Bishop. Also, Miss Watts. Phillips appears as the
best girl of that supremely objectionable person,
the comic lout with the red hair, and The Bul-
letin’s angry passions rise as he paws her about
and squints lovingly at her. The balance of the
exhibition consists mainly of J-. W. Sweeney’s
gigantic and refreshing Irishman, also the
policeman, the inspector, the coffee-stall female,
the crossing-sweeper, the big flunkey, the
brainless lord, the broken-down lawyer, and
the miscellaneous females who are out late at
night, presumably for nefarious purposes.

Shakespeare retires from Sydney Criterion
this week after a career which ought to warm the
soul of any dramatist, and “ The Times ” takes
his place on Saturday. Also, the new act-drop is
to be lowered that night for the first time. A
full account of this ravishing rag will appear next
week. The Lyceum pantomime shows no sign of
age or decay, and continues to look with a painted
front down a long avenue of prospective success.
Rickards’ minstrel-show holds the Opera House
with satisfactory results.

Coogee Aquarium made a special effort on
Anniversary Day, and held a variety of olde
Englyshe sports,'including a cigar-smoking con-
test, grinning through a horse - collar the
ugliest grin to win, picking half-a-sovereign out
of a bowl of treacle—the competitor to use his
countenance only and the winner to keep the coin,
doing ditto out of a bowl of flour, bun-eating com-
petition, &c. The Bulletin still waits hopefully
for news of the death of the successful bun-eater,
but that heavy-laden individual is reported to be
getting the better of his dyspepsia and coming
round.

Miss Clara Merivalo’s benefit at Sydney
Royal was the last visitation of ill-luck upon the
head of a lady who deserved better fortune.
The company did its part manfully, but an
execrably poor audience formed only a few
islands in the great ocean of deserted seats, and
blank misery sat heavily on them in their loneli-
ness. The Bulletin here drops a painful subject

“ Tommy” Hudson, after 11 years’ absence
from Sydney, opened yet another minstrel-show
at the Garrick on Saturday. As a rule, one
minstrel-show is very like another, and “ Tommy’
Hudson’s programme presents the same unfailing
resemblance to itself which characterises all the
rest. The company is particularly strong, how-
ever, in the musical and vocal line, and if the
murky end-men and their conundrums were
abolished, a most respectable opera troupe might
be made out of the balance. Miss May Habgoqd
is a musician of a very high order, and Miss
Isabel Webster (both ladies hail from the Royal
College ot Music) and a singer far above the usual
variety-show standard. The same may be said
of Misses Busch and Roberts, and “Tommy 1 '
himself was built for better, though, perhaps, less
profitable, things. The show was received on the
opening night with enthusiasm, almost every item
being encored, and several being demanded three
times. Even the fact that some of the conundrums
of the corner-men obviously belong to the vintage
of years gone by, didn’t make any appreciable
difference.
The Circus is pack’t, they can't cram any mere
in—
A pound couldn’t purchase a seat;
No show can attract like a lion who’s roarin’
And ready for something to eat:
Who, if in a rage with the man in the cage,
Would certainly treat him as meat.
The people keep still, as a growl breaks the
silence,
The Tamer is whipping the beast,
Perchance now he will be a victim to vi’lence,
He seems not afraid in the least;
Yet the crowd in the tent has a pre-senti-ment
That the animal’s “ on ” for a feast.
The men hold their breath, and the girls all are
trembling—
Expecting a “ horrible ” sight.
The boys, pale as death, never think of dis-
sembling
Their awe-stricken joy and delight,
And anxiously wait, as, with rod, line and bait,
Ofttimes they have watched for a bite.
The lion looked mad, but ho might have been
gamer,
His calmness the people deplore ;
They reckoned, begad ! he would go for the
Tamer
And spatter the cage with his gore.
The girls couldn’t swoon, but they’ll come again
soon
On the chance of a pleasure in store.

Fillis’ Circus, which, on its artistic merits
alone, would have repeated the Sydney success in
Melbourne, secured an irresistible advertisement
on its opening night. The boss lion, as everybody
knows, decided to “gag” his part by knocking
Cantain Russell down, after which, inspired by
the yell of excitement that greeted his new busi-
ness, Pasha made a playful bite at his fellow
tragedian, and the triumph of the new Circus was
complete. Deep down in every human breast is
implanted a desire to be present when something
happens to the lion-tamer, so as soon as a ghastly
element of uncertainty crept into this last item on
the bill the multitude began to roll up with dis-
tended nostrils, sniffing for a sanguinary sacrifice.
Pasha, a naturally peaceful beast bred in cap-
tivity, has studied mankind to some purpose, and
his nightly wink at the management, after he has
gazed around and made a mental calculation of
the money in the tent, is full of meaning. No
wonder that his salary has been raised several
ribs of beef per diem. Next to Pasha in public
estimation comes Fillis, whose joyous monkey act
seems very little short of a full-grown miracle.
The infant Bertie on the high trapeze, the senti-
mental clown, and the vision that flitted through
hoops, were likewise received with enthusiasm
during the first week of the show. This week
Madame Fillis is a leading feature in the change
of programme, and the famous Water Pantomime
looms in the near distance.

Meanwhile pantomime is going the way of
the Roman Empire which declined and fell. Even
a second edition of “ Forty Thieves ” is as naught
compared with the possibilities of a hungry lion,
and the humour of the average harlequinade pales
beside five elephants standing oh tubs. The
second edition of the Princess’s pantomime would
probably be an improvement on the first if it in-
.oluded the old original ass. On Saturday last
.another performer was wearing the skin of the
-star donkey, and the show seemed a lot worse for
>the change. Apart from this calamity there were
signs that an earlier revising of the business might
'have delayed the day of doom for the W. and M.’s
.gorgeous delusion. More use is now made of
Bnazelle, who breaks out in operatic selections
and divides a topical song with Lonnen. It isn’t a
very catchy topical song, but it takes the place of
something that was much more painful, and
arouses a feeling of gratitude accordingly. “Forty
Thieves” may possibly recover popular favour
before the final curtain-bell rings, inasmuch as the
'rival panto, promises to die at an earlier date.
Wednesday matinees are still advertissd, and on
Friday next (Feb.:3) the drama will start at seven

“Babes in the Wood” has also been im-

adds a little human interest to the festive scene.
The ancient kings of England continue to weaken

begins to let go, she usually gets there, more or

•recognised in a liberal manner before and behind
'the curtain. Frank Clark is off to America with-
out any fixed intention of returning, but he will

116th under the direction of W. A. Jinkins. It
appears that the production of babies has been in

a brilliant display of fatted calves is confidently

cases, pawning their clothes to nourish the only
'member of the family who has found a job.

Fred. Leslie left Nellie Farren a legacy of £2OOO. It is
rumoured that she has quite gone off her head with grief
at his death.
Who wouldn’t own a boxing kangaroo ? The gay mar-
supial now on show at Westminster draws large crowds
nightly and is said to earn for his owner no less than
£24,000 a year. This is more than any two-legged pugilist
can do even with the help of mammoth purses. The
no-called boxing between the kangaroo and his ovvnt r is
an outrageous piece of buffoonery; but then, English
‘people are easily pleased, arid it is necessary to play down
’to the level of their intelligence.
The story goes that after Leslie’s death Danby
ordered his things to be taken up to Fred’s dressing-room
’it London Gaiety. On being asked why he had done so
'ais reply was, “lam now the leading comedian of th’
Gaiety.” This was promptly told to the management, and
the “ leading comedian ” was requested to take his things
back again. He demurred, and demanded that he should be
considered Leslie’s successor, threatening, in case of
refusal, to leave the show. The refusal came, and Danby
thereupon ceased his connection with the theatre. But
reflection brought home to him the folly of his hasty
ultimatum ; he sought to be restored to his position, but
met with a polite refusal.
Writes The Bulletin’s London correspondentPenley
has a fortune in “Charley’s Aunt," a farcical comedy by
Brandon Thomas, which I ventured to predict in your
columns months ago would be a big success. It is cer-
tainly the best and funniest thing of the sort which has
been ever produced in London, and can give points to the
“ Private Secretary.” The first performance in London,
even though it took place at that little hole, the Royalty,
was a thing to be remembered. I have never in all my
experience seen so enthusiastic an audience, and from
start to finish they were kept in a continuous roar of
laughter. In any other hands but Penley’s there would
have been a risk that the character of “ Charley's Aunt”
might degenerate into vulgarity, but the clever little
comedian managed to steer clear of anything of the kind,
and what in other hands would possibly have been offen-
sive, was simply an admirable piece of comic acting.
Penley will probably make £40,000 or £50,000 out of it.
It will be sure to have a two years’ run in London and
the provinces, and then you may have a chance of seeing
it in Australia.
Fanny Enson has a London engagement in George

three splendid six-months-old cubs from Sydney Zoo.

bred), and are in treaty with that fetching tamer,
Madame Scherazade, late of Fillis’s Circus. The
Fitzgeralds’ lions, after a severe course of train-
ing, will presently appear on horseback and other
unlikely places, in addition to going through the time-
honoured cage tricks. Meanwhile, there is a large fortune
sticking out for anybody who can leach a crocodile to fly
a kite with his tail.
The Australasian conceived the brilliant idea of inter-
viewing Lonnen, a gentleman who, according to that
bulky organ, “discovered” the national larrikin to the
Australian stage. This statement need not wound the
feelings of Whitburn and other individuals who consider
themselves ignored in the matter. Lonnen did discover
his particular kind of larrikin—in London. He “uncon-
sciously cerebrated ” the young man from Chevalier’s
coster, and traded him off upon gallery-boys and weak-
minded journalists as the genuine Australian article.
Also, he has set a young Hebrew to reproduce the awful
hybrid thing in miniature, and the infant Hebrew seems
to have “ improved ” on Lonnen’s effort by instinct.
A certain much-travelled organist now travelling the
Australias has a habit of airing his grievances in public.
Recently he said to the “musical critic” of a paper up
South: “Look here, sir; you know nothing about music
whatever, so if you dare to criticise my performance
unfavourably, by Heaven I’ll denounce you from the
platform as a humbug.” Notices laudatory up to date.

A certain well-known comedian has now visited Aus-

In the recent racket between Captain Russell and Fillis’
big lion, Tub Bulletin’s sympathies are with the lion.
If this paper had been the lion, and the gallant Captain
had knocked it about in his usual somewhat-brutal
fashion, the possibilities are that he would have been
chewed a good deal worse than he was.
The next Savoy opera, says our correspondent, will he
by Ernest Ford, a very promising young musician
who lias, until recently, been conducting the orchestra at
the Trafalgar Square Theatre. The book is by an un-
named author, generally believed to be Justin Huntly
M’Carthy. And, speaking of the Savoy 7, reminds me that
it is said the proposed collaboration by Gilbert and
Sullivan is off. Old sores cannot be easily healed.
I often wonder, remarks The Bulletin’s Lond n corres
pondent, where dramatists expect to find customers for
their work. Their number is ever increasing. Christie
Murray has been busy collaborating with his brother
Henry—an exceedingly clever fellow, by the way—and
Johnny Shine, and the outcome of their labours is three
plays, one of which has been offered to Alexander, another
to Terry, whilst the third has been written specially
round Charles Warner, and it is thought will fit him like
a glove. I hope one or other of these works will succeed,
for Christie is fairly due for a favourable turn of
“ fortune’s faithless wheel.” Haddon Chambers, too, has
been away toiling (o complete his commissions. He has
three plays on the stocks, but he is bound hand and foot
by William Terriss to have a play for him ready before
March next, and has covenanted not to produce another
until this has been delivered. Terriss, in fact, has paid a
good bit down on account, and means to have his money’s
worth. Haddon’s three successive fiascos will, no doubt,
have taught him the lesson that if he hopes to compete
Successfully with more experienced writers he must not
do any slipshod work. Clever as he undoubtedly is, he
has not yet arrived at that pinnacle of fame which will
make a play go down by his name alone. The success of
“The idler, ’’ following so quickly upon that of “ Captain
Swift,”caused his head to swell a bit, but that is over now
The Wild-Cat Column.
The Federal Bank (Melb.) suspended payment
last Monday, and the usual liquidation is expected. The
Federal was originally one of Janies Munro’a institutions,
and the fatal influence of James possibly had something
to do vyith its downfall. At the same time, the collapse,
according to the directors’ own showing, is somewhat
inexplicable. The reserve fund, or a great part of it, has
gone in the shrinkage of securities, but the capital of
£400,000 is said to be intact. This will almost certainly
vanish in the process of liquidation—it always does —so
the directors appear to be throwing away £400,000
of their own and other people’s money without any
real effort to save it. The Federal had £400,000
unpaid capital, and although, apparently, it was suffering
from nothing save temporary pressure and withdrawal of
confidence, and only wanted time to make everything
right, yet no one seems to have dreamt of calling up this
amount to save a valuable institution from destruction.
Somehow the average Australian bank will rather go into
bankruptcy than make calls ; if anyone recollects any
Australian bank of recent years that has called up its
capital in preference to liquidating, The Bulletin, at all
events, does not. The Federal’s position, judged by its
published accounts, seems to be just this: it might have
saved the £400,000 already at stake by calling up
the other £400,000, and it wouldn’t do it—or else, for some
occult reason, it couldn’t. Further, apart from this pro-
blem, the directors’ explanation seems unaccountable.
The Federal, it is claimed, has sufficient assets, even
under the ruinous process of liquidation, to pay all its
creditors in full and leave something over, altogether
apart from the £400,000 uncalled. With such solid
security behind them the directors could have gone on
paying their depositors so long as a solitary coin remained
in the bank, without injury to anyone, and before they got
down to that last sovereign the tide of public con-
fidence might possibly have turned—at all events, on the
published statements, nothing could have been lost by
that process and everything might have been gained.
Further, taking all things into account, it seems abso-
lutely amazing that a syndicate of wealthy directors and
others did not proceed to buy up the 50s. shares when
they were abundantly available at 2s. 6d. or thereabouts,
aud then pay up the unpaid capital and keep the bank
afloat. There ought to have been £200,000 profit
in such a transaction if the Federal was anything near as
sound as it is made to look. The Bulletin suspects that
the public don’t yet quite know the worst about the
Federal Banking Co.

The new Queensland loan is being offered on
the London market at something like 85 net—a melan-
choly £B5 for every £lOO debenture. It would probably
be a lot cheaper to file the national schedule than borrow
at such a rate as this. And yet while the miserable,
stone-broke Kanaka Government is struggling to raise ij
millions on terms that a respectable three-ball Hebrew
would be ashamed of, £2,000,000 are lying unused in the
Queensland National Bank, and have been lying there for
months—or years. Several influential local politicians
are understood to he large shareholders in the Q.N. Bank.
Is there anything wrong with that institution so that they
are afraid to withdraw the money? Or does it simply
mean that is a good spec, for the Bank to get the public
funds at 4 per cent, interest and lend them out at 7 or 8,
while the Treasury goes broke? Or if this isn’t it, then
what does it mean ?
* * *
The present condition of the Balmain Steam
Perry Co. is an excellent illustration of how even the very
best of properties, dependent for its prosperity on public
support, can be smashed up by lordly pigheadedness and
offensive bluster. It is clearly to the interest of the
Balmain people that they should continue to support the
new company at whatever cost. The shareholders of the
old co. want their directors to resign. But the horse is
stolen.

The Perpetual Trustee Co. of N.S.W. forges
steadily ahead, is now more than out of debt, and has
now the management of cash and securities representing
two millions sterling. It should yet achieve the magni-
ficent success attained by its Southern prototypes. No one
should make his will without naming such a co. one of
his executors.
# * *
Among the N.S.W. Parliamentary papers
printed to the order of the Assembly is the “ corres-
pondence, &c received by the Government on the Broken
Hill strike.” Some portions are suggestive. On 4th
July ’92, labour-leader Richard Sleath (now a prisoner in
gaol) wired to Attorney-General Barton, and used this
expression : “ Thanks for services offered.” On the very
same date, William Knox, the mineowners’ secretary, in
Ms wire to “ Toby ” Barton, said : “ I am desired ” (by
the mining companies) “to thank you for your offer.”
Now, what some inquisitive N.S.W. member should do is
to move for a return of all the “correspondence, &c.,"
sent by the Government in connection with the Broken
Hill strike. What “services” did Barton “offer” to
Sleath? What*“ offer” did he make to Knox? What
was his relation to the hare ? And what his connection
with the hounds?
* * *
What has become of those tremendous steel and
iron works so boomed by a Sydney paper some months
back as if they were an accomplished fact ? True extracts
from a letter from one Albert Leahy, C.E., to one W. M.
Foote, M.E. (always), have been published, wherein we
are told how very averse the British capitalist is to any
“Colonial ” investment—all, of course, on account of the
Barrier strike. One might reasonably think the igno-
minious defeat of the miners, the gaoling of the leaders,
and glorious victory for Capitalism would have turned
things the other way about. But it is a good thing to
have an excuse for failure. It is somewhat indefinite to
hear that, bad as affairs are, some two or three firms are
ready to finance the iron-smelting, and there is a hope of
the works being established “on a small scale.” And yet
the public were led to believe that men and money were
ready.
• * *
Gann, the member for the Barrier, says that the
most fiendish thing he ever heard of is the mine-owners’
black-list of the men who took any prominent part in the
strike. “ Because you had the courage of your opinions
you shall not live if we can help it.” Such cold-blooded
cruelty is a challenge to civil war. The Bulletin re-
commends the mine-owners to bury the hatchet
like men.
# • •
The right of might. Thomas, one of the miners’
advocates in the Barrier strike, and a member of the
lead-poisoning commission, has been refused permission
to descend the mines in the performance of his duties on
the ground of the possible disaffection he might thereby
cause. Great Heavens ! has it come to this—the lessees
of the State’s property prohibit the entry of the State’s
commissioner! As the N.S.W. Government has not
insisted, we have another proof of Ministerial weakness
and of the brute force of Barrier capitalistic strength.

The banks are as largely responsible for the
collapse in Broken Hill shares as is the fall of silver. By
their freedom with money they first fanned the boom
in them to such a degree that they reached unreasonable
prices. Now, in the midst of a train of adverse circum-
stances they are practically shovelling them into the
market to protect overdrafts. There is just as much mad-
ness in one proceeding as the other, and in each case it is
the invincible big holders, the men who originally got
their shares for next to nothing, who alone continue to
accumulate money.

N.S.W. 1892 gold-yield, 144,2590z5.—an increase
on the previous ydar of about 26,0000z5. As elsewhere
the interest in the industry goes down as the yields go
up. The yield is made up by a great number of districts,
Armidale being top with 33,0000z5. The total is miser-
ably small considering the number of “ gold-fields.”

Too much has been made of a silver and gold
discovery, recently made at Peak Hill, N.S.W. Assays
showing considerably over lOOoz. gold and over 10000/.
silver were published far arid wide. A ton of the ore was
forwarded to Sydney for immediate treatment, and it was
estimated to lie worth £5OO in gold and silver. It has
been crushed —and so have the enthusiasts. £5OO ex-
pected ; about £lOO received. The return was composed
of 20oz. gold and 139 of silver—truly, a most sensational
return, if the optimistic estimates had not been so widely
published. The result of the Peak Hill Proprietary crush-
ing was much less than one-fifth of that predicted by the
local newspaper correspondents.

George Lansell, having in his 180 mine reached a
depth of 2860 ft.—we believe it is now the world’s deepest
gold mine— has determined to go down another 300 ft.
Lansell led the way to deep-sinking on Bendigo, and, as
he often predicted, he has lived to see the day when the
bulk of the field’s gold would come from greater depths
than alleged geologists predicted it could exist at.
The Bulletin hopes he will live to see the 180 down to
3500 ft.

Nambucca Heads Gold and Silver Mining Go.
has held its half-yearly meeting. The shareholders
listened to a tale of woe. The chairman admitted that
prospects of the possession of large and rich ore bodies
had been dissipated, and indicated much managerial dis-
satisfaction. Hope is now centred in the undeveloped
parts of the property. Remote hope ! Another instance
of mad mining. The sensible plan would have been to
prove the ore-bodies before spending thousands in chlori-
nation and other machinery. This was a pyritous forma-
tion, out of which a few rich tons for Sydney, Ballarat, or
any other place could always be got. In mining one diffi-
culty is to find the lode ; but after that a much greater
difficulty is to find the man. Somebody was at last found
for Nambucca, and whether one or many they are deserv-
ing of sympathy. A few 7 days ago the writer deeply sym-
pathised with a man w 7 ho, three or four months ago,
strongly advised his friends to purchase these shares at
£l, on being sadly “left” himself. The latter coolly
answered; “ Why, I sold every share !”

Mandurama, N.S.W., formerly known as the
Junction reefs, is, it is reported, being worked by Vic-
torians. The results have not been up to expectations,
but it is intended to float the property into a large co., in
England. It narrowly escaped flotation in England, five
years ago, for which the English people have, w 7 e take it,
never expressed their sorrow 7 . It has a nominal capital of
£BOO,OOO, if you please. The mine cons'sts of a series of
flat decomposed auriferous formations, plenty of ore, but
very poor in gold, the average being, by the ordinary
methods of treatment (and it is not rich enough to stand
any other), from three to four dwts. to the ton. The gold
is fine but free. The mine has abundance of water-power,
and a plant consisting of 30 head, and a Huntingdon Mill,
all driven by a turbine wheel. The owners, Sydney men
at one time, expected to make a pot of money out of the
concern, but it boomed not, and if it floats in England
they should consider themselves men of luck.
# # *
During a brief stoppage at a Western N.S.W.
railway station the writer heard something re the late
auriferous discovery in the Gordon Emery mine. An
excitable individual, conversing through the carriage-
window in tones so confidential that most of the pas-
sengers in the train could hear, declared that it was
amazingly rich, and being asked if it were intended to
float it in Melbourne or Sydney, said, “There isn’t
enough money in either place to buy it.” For further in-
formation reference was made to some men in the train
who had examined the discovery. They were consulted.
They were of cooler heads and judgment, and said
the find was rich in places, poor in others, and generally
patchy. Thus we have a glimmering of the authorship of
the reports of this pigment-mine which has afforded the
public so much amusement. By the way, what has
become of the many tons of “ brown,” “ red,” and other
“oxides” sent away from this property? Of course it
went to London and was sold. What did it realise, and
were the expectations of the shareholders fulfilled?
# * *
The writer has been shown some wonderfully
rich specimens of reef-gold from W.A. The metal is
embodied in solid quartz, and in several pieces composes
50 per cent, to the matrix. It is represented to have
come from inland Pilbarra, and the finder had to leave
the place for want of water.
# * *
Some of the stories told of W. A. goldfields
to-day eclipse those of the old digging times of the other
provinces. Here is one: A young man—call him Smith-
cam e across, away beyond the Murchison district, a rich
vein, from which, in a few days, he dollied out £BOO. He
then sold his claim for £2O, and made for the seaboard
with his money to await a steamer for Adelaide. Ere he
left, however, the purchaser turned up with the same
intention and £lOOO worth of gold. He, too, had sold out
for a small sum, and those who are left are doing equally
well, and, what seems more sensible, are sticking to it.
The fact that many W.A. quartz specimens contain nearly
one-half gold will not he regarded by many miners as
a sign of the permanent or uniform richness of the reefs
from which they were taken.
* * *
A correspondent wants to know what lias become
of the Argentine silver mine (N.Q.); why is it that no
meeting of shareholders has been held for 15 months, and
what has become of the capital subscribed ? Thus we are
pleasantly reminded of the floating of this concern, and
the reports in which the “ Jerky Jim " lode played a pro-
minent part. When the prospectus of this mine was
issued in Melbourne the public were invited to come
early so as to avoid being crushed to death in the rush for
scrip.
# * *
Reported that some school-boys recently found
in Rangaloon district, near Bowral, N S.W., some
diamonds and other gems. Since which, £5OO has been
spent by a Sydney firm in prospecting.

The secretary of a mine at Swamp Oak, N.S.W.,
is delegated by the shareholders to float a co., and he
applies to the warden for a month’s suspension of labour.
Request refused. A manager is then appointed, and he
works the concern with three shareholders, and puts
through the stone at grass, some 30 tons, for (i ozs. The
shareholders sue the manager for wages and cost of
carting and crushing. They obtain judgment; and the
manager has to pay. He fails to get his own wages
because the company is not registered.

“ Quid Nunc,” of the Mining Standard
(Sydney), is doubtful whether the reef recently struck in
the Baker’s Creek North is Smith’s reef. If he had ever
been in the mine, he would know that the reef recently
struck has been worked in the upper levels to the Baker’s
Creek boundary, and that no sensible man has any possible
shadow of doubt about it.

Ex-Premier Shiels wears his fast-greying

Lord Elgin, who, it is said, will succeed
Gov. Jersey at Sydney, is a Canadian by birth,

Gov. Hopetoun’s three months’ holiday
also preludes an early departure. He will return
to England a year before his full time is up.
Mr. Henry Parkes really did all he
could to make his book saleable. He did not
publish in it a single line of his own poetry.
Chief Justice Way (S.A.) says that the
man who does not change his opinions in the
space of two years is either a fool or a fossil.
The recent attitude of Mr. Dibbs to Gov.
Jersey was that of a Republican who had helped
himself to a cigar from the Heir-apparent’s case.
Rudyard Kipling writes of “ The Broken

A son of G. R. Dibbs, after six years in
the N.S.W. Civil Service, has £2O per annum less
salary than when he started, and not through lack
of merit.
Willis, M.P. (N.S.W.), has given Premier
Dibbs’ nephew, according to his own statement,
“a billet droving out west, at £1 a week and his

Fergus Hume says the world will persist

Why should it ?
William Myles, aged 96, died last week at
Yass, N.S.W., where he had resided for 64 years.
He was in his youth an intimate of Hamilton

Victoria’s leading Tory organ piped very
small concerning the alleged embezzlements of
Humphries. Peculations by the humble secretary
of a friendly society are usually announced in
large type, but an “ unfortunate scandal ” at the

deplored in an unobtrusive paragraph.
Two members of

Considering that all

to see what‘the objec-

grumble about. If

it was their own op-
pressive family piety—
the scoff of their com-

side with the long-

It is rumoured that an Australian Premier

J. L. Bonython, proprietor of S.A.

Funny but true. Baker and Kingston,
who would have fought a duel to the death a
month ago had the latter had his way, travelled
from Melbourne to Adelaide last week in the

Queen Victoria has refused to join an
Anti-Crinoline League. The fact is she can-
not forget that her late lamented husband
professed to admire her in crinolines, and she has
secretly resented every change of fashion since
Albert died.
William M‘Kollar, who died at Benalla
(Vic.), the other day, aged 06 years, is said to
have been the first white man to permanently
settle in the N.E. district of Victoria. M'Kellar
landed in Sydney in ’3B, and went to what is now
Benalla in ’39.

Shiels wished to be excused from repre-
senting Victoria at the Federal Council, “as the
sea did not agree with him.” This young man is
the most hopeless collapse Australia has seen in
politics. A few months ago he was a magnificent
.specimen of a politician afflicted with “big head,”
and tackled the country with sublime sang froid ;
to-day, there are none so poor as to do him rever-
ence—not even his poor self—and he is frightened
from his lightest duty by a vision of a ship’s
’-steward armed with a tin dish.
Resurrected quotation
from an old Victorian Legis-
lative Assembly debate: —
Zeal: “Go home, you pump-
kin, and grow peas and car-
rots.” Bent (the “pump-
kin ”); “ I needn’t go home.
I always know where to look
for a dirty little scrub of a
carrot.” (Zeal is small and
redheaded.) Now Zeal is
the dignified President of
the Legislative Council,
and Bent presides over the
Assembly.
Comparing the past and
present reputations of Bis-
marck and De Lesseps, who

one way or other, to write
their names across the pages
of history?” Ask Parkes.
The latest “contra-
dicted ” story about Mrs.
Langtry accused her of heav-
ing a tumbler at young
Robert Peel whilst they
were dining together at the
Savoy Hotel. Womanlike,
the beautiful Lily missed
her mark and hit a neigh-
bouring lady in the back,
whereupon arose a tumult
which terminated in the
polite expulsion of Mrs. L.
and her “ mash ” from the
licensed premises. This
story, we repeat, has been
contradicted.
Solemn fact ! A Bul-
letin man lately picked out
of the sixpenny book-box at
a Sydney dealer’s shop a
volume of the “ Breitmann
Ballads,” bearing B. R.
Wise’s autograph on the
title-page. After planking
down the sixpence, he
asked the dealer how he
came to sell at such a
price, or at all, the
book of so distinguished
a man. “Wise? Who’s he? ”
Such is fame.
Justice Bundey (S. A.) never forgets that
Colton (then Premier) promised, if he accepted
the judgeship, to raise the salary from ,£l7OO to
£2OOO. The extra money didn’t come, however.
Bundey, it is said, was previously making £5OOO
a year, and kept a yacht, which he has had to give
up.
Burke, the explorer, buried at Innamincka
(S.A.), has a very humble grave. The only indi-

inscribed—

The body is buried opposite in the sandy soil.
Edmund Mitchell’s (ex-secretary Victorian
Pastoralists’ Union) syndicated novel opens well.
Mitchell can write much better than he can
speak, like most born journalists. Like Whiteley
King, Epps, Cockburn, and others of the men
who have swapped journalism for Capitalistic
Association secretaryships, he is a democrat at
heart.
George Milner Stephen has been once
more perambulating Adelaide, S.A. as a great
healer. He simply “commands” the pains and
ailments to go, and a hiatus is here left for
prayer. In ’3B, this Stephen (who is a brother of
ex-Judge Alfred Stephen, of N.S. W.) was Acting-
Governor of South Australia —warming-pan for
Gov. Gawler.
A letter has been received by a friend of
Charles Lilley, the evicted Chief Justice of Queens-
land, stating that it is within the bounds of possi-
bility that he may be asked to resume his former
position. It is generally believed, however, that,
should Griffith by any chance not hold on to the
“good thing” he has made for himself, Pat. Real
will be the new Chief Justice, and that Bruin
will retire on his pension.
Bruin, a Queensland Supreme Court
justice, sworn to uphold the law, is a deadly
opponent of the law-cheapening Legal Prac-
titioners’ Act. A respectable but poverty-stricken
solicitor apologised for appearing in court, on the
ground that his client was too poor to employ
counsel, whereupon Bruin insolently and sarcasti-
cally referred to him as “a gentleman of poor
dress and worse address.”
. Phillip Menncll (writes The Bulletin’s
London correspondent by last mail) has now the
chief interest in the British Australasian,
which was originally founded by him. He has
bought out Nash, who goes to Sydney next month
as financial editor of the Daily Telegraph. He
is well up in figures. I hear that he expects to be
extensively consulted by the Treasurer, and to be
a sort of financial adviser to the Government.
D. B. VV. Sladen has returned to London
from a two years’ trip through the United States
and Japan, and is now located (says our corres-
pondent) in a charming flat at Kensington, where
every Tuesday Mrs. Sladen gives smart “at
homes ” to people of note in the artistic and
literary world. D.B.W. is hon. secretary of the
Authors’ Club, which is on the high road to being
the most distinguished literary centre in the
metropolis.
G. W. Rusden has turned up again in
Melbourne. Daddy Longlegs is a nickname he
chuckles over, for he is a reminder of Cruikshank’s
drawing of Nobody. He has a nut-cracker face,
or call it a crab-apple, wrinkly, crinkly. His
shrill voice, common to people of his construction,
pipes piquantly. The current praise of Higin-
botham induces theßusdenites to rake up G. W.’s
allusions to him, in that beautifully lopsided
work “ The History of Australia,” even more
bitter than the M.L. history, for which he had to
back down to Bryce.
Ex-Premier Munro : “I came to Mel-

through liabilities which I undertook, never ex-

unable to pay 20s. in the pound. I have now
returned to Melbourne, and intend, if spared, to
work hard to retrieve my position ; but I have
made up my mind never again to incur any debt
even if 1 have to starve.”
It is related how Fitz Gibbon showed Gov.
Loch over the source of the Melbourne water-
supply. From an eminence the Duke of Mel-
bourne pointed to a range of hills, saying :
There, your Excellency, in that blue crescent range is
our Heaven-sent watershed. Now, I shall show, burstimr
forth from the flood-gates, in the pristine purity in which
it wells from the heart of those everlasting hills, the
pellucid stream that supplies our city with health and
cleanliness. This way, nielud 1
Then Fitz. led on to the flood-gates, and pointed
out —the swollen corpse of a drowned dingo
caught on the grating.
Austin Brereton, late of Sydney (wrijbes
The Bulletin’s London correspondent), is now
doing Clement Scott’s work on London Daily
Telegraph, and is in great feather. He occupies
Scott’s chambers whilst the latter is away. There
is a rumour that Clement took unto himself a wife
before he left, but this is denied by Brereton. It
is certain that for a long time past Clement has
paid marked attention to a certain lady well-
known in London. But there is also another who
claims the gay critic as her fianci, and it would be
a dreadful blow to her if it should turn out that
he is married.

Shiels escapes the indignity of not being

The Brisbane R.C. organ jabs its horns

Ex-Premier Shiels told a Melbourne

The Bulletin takes exception to the

there’s inefficiency, because there’s favouritism.

What we want is a ‘ steak in the stomach.’ This

J. B. Patterson, the new Victorian Pre-
mier (he isn’t a teetotaller), once described the
hotelkeepers as a “lot of lazy loafers, who pumped
up beer to demoralise both barmaids and cus-
tomers.”
The Labour-party are quarrelling in Pre-
mier Downer’s district of Barossa (S. A.), and two
candidates will run for their vote, unless a com-
promise is arrived at. This means victory for
Downer.
About the worst disgusted man in Aus-

Harper is brutally National Ass, and would have
gambled his skin on his chances of office in the

One, at least, of the Victorian Labour

headlong into “ evening dress ” on £6 a week is a
pitiable thing.

The principal immediate object-lesson of
the Patterson Premiership in Victoria seems to
be that masterfulness, whether for good or bad, is
the quality most essential to the success of per-
sonal ambition in a politician.
The Dibbs Ministry must have been ter"
ribly scared of Parkes’alleged intention to censure
them oyer their financial proposals when they put
up their rank and file to stonewall their own
monthly Supply Bill for hours.
Glassey, Labour M.L.A. (Q.), points out
that £5OOO presumably expended in the Queens-
land shearers’ strike business still remains unac-
counted for. One officer admits having torn up
vouchers for upwards of £lOOO.
Significant slab from Premier Dibbs on
Imperialism versus Protection ; “ I felt far moi’e

The Medical Congress, lately held in
Sydney, is having its reports and papers printed
free at the N.S.W- Government Printing Office.
Iniquitous! Five hundred pounds saved a wealthy
trades-union at the expense of the People.
A great many members of N.S.W. Upper
House, including Hoskins, are in favour of the
Elections Bill because of its provision for single
electorates. They think it will cripple the Demo-
cratic vote and make elections more expensive.
Sydney newspapers could endure Dibbs
with government advts. : but directly he hinted
at economical advertising and preference for the
neutral pages of the Government Gazette they
clamored for his dismissal from the Premiership.
It is difficult to find a term to describe the
audacity, the bigoted one-sidedness, of the N.S.
Wales Ms.L.C. who denounce the class legislation
of Labour members, while belonging to a body as
purely class representative as the House of Lords,
In Adelaide, last week, a man charged
with having no visible means of support said it
wasn’t true and produced 6Jd., and the court held
it wasn’t enough and sent him up for two months.
Being content with a little doesn’t always answer.
The Melbourne (Vic.) syndicate which
owns Tindarey station, Bourke, N.S.W., the other
day gave the hands there notice of reduction of
wages to 15s. per week. A general exodus re-
sulted, and the Sydney Government Labour-bureau
furnished substitutes.
The vice-regal persons of Australia are
undoubtedly useful as instruments of jobbery,
anyhow. Lord Hopetoun delayed his jaunt to
Maoriland, in order that he might be at hand to
sign anything he was told to sign, and when the
political corpse of Shiels put an order for 98 new
J.P.’s under his noble nose, he just wrote his
name as usual.

W. R. Campbell is apparently the most
Radical member of N.S.W. Legislative Council.
He continually argues that the Upper House has
no right to reject or nullify measures passed by
the Lower Chamber containing principles held by
a large majority of the people,

It is estimated that the big Robb Arbitra*

has already totted up £25,000 worth of expenses.
Does any sane man believe that any sane con-
tractor would run all this rig it the result were
not almost a foregone conclusion?
The opening mass meeting in connection
with the Labour election campaign at the Albion,
near Brisbane (Q.), was remarkable for being
numerously attended by female workers, married
and single. The Bananalandress intends to be an
active element in future local politics.
A telegram in a London paper stated that
the Premier of Queensland, having gone on a pro-
longed tour North, had left the Ministry in charge
of the leader of the Opposition. Which is
not so unusual an in coalition
government as it appears on the surface.
The new Victorian Premier, Patterson, is
reputedly “a strong man ’’and plays the game for
all it is worth. Beetling brows, a rakish jaw, and
a habit of looking ugly when he talks, have won
him the reputation of being a devil of a fellow
amongst those who are awed by bulk and splutter.
From the form of ex-Premier Shiels’
declaration that 2| years of office have hardened
his opinion that the present system of Party
Government—Government by Contradiction—is a
failure, it is plain that Shiels is a Bulletin con-
vert, without the heart to crystallise his political
beliefs into action.
The “Year-book of Australia,” special
edition of 5000 copies—issued under the authority
of the N.S.W. Government at a cost of £250 —is
distributed, with a special cover, by the Depart-
ments. “ Mr. So-and-so, with compliments and
greeting for the New Year, 1893.” Lovely
method of retrenchment!
The N.S.W. legislator evinces an over-
powering lust for the bawbees in his country’s
extremity. Contrast his voluntary abandonment
of 5 per cent, on £3OO a year, with an expected
exemption of £2OO, with the statutory shearing of
the Tasmanian politicians’ screw by 25 per cent.,
with no exemption at all.
Premier Dibbs (N.S.W.) says that his
Government is still Protectionist, but it considers
the time is “inopportune” for dealing with
the fiscal question. As Dibbs was made Premier
for the express purpose of dealing with that
question the time must also be “inopportune”
for him to remain in office.-
It is rumoured that the N.S.W. Judges,
following George Higinbotham’s example, have
sent in a strong remonstrance to the Attorney-
General against the slur which has been cast on
their patriotism, by the proposal to exclude them
fr®m paying income-tax. The rumour is in tem-
porary need of confirmation.
Let the public keep in view the fact that
all this eable-talk about Australian public insol-
vency is the outcome of a gigantic conspiracy, in
which many local public men take part, to grab
the existing State railways. Let the electors never
forget that the control of the railways means even
more than the control of the land.
Softgoods Reid is the new Minister of
Defence for Victoria. Robert Reid, only three
months a member of the Leg. Council, is coming
to the fore as violently as did Matthew Davies.
The sudden importance of this person from “the
Lane ” passeth all understanding. The Bulletin
will watch his career with much interest.
To construct, according to the latest Griftil-
wraith proposals, the land-grab lines passed by the
Queensland Parliament, would cost Bananaland
64,000,000 acres of land, at a constructing cost of
£5OOO per mile, or 100,000 square miles of the
“ eyes ”of the country ! And the people would
have to “ buy ” back the lines in the future ! !
One thing must be said for Deakin. He
was pressed hard to accept a knighthood, and un-
like G. Republican Dibbs, he had the courage
(and the sense) to refuse. Until Australians look
for honours only to their own land their average
Parliamentarian will ever stand expectant, with
painted face, on the sidewalks of political prosti-
tution.
A certain Australian Postmaster-General
handed in a bill for cab-hire for one year : ,£2oo—
quite 13s. per day. It was paid without a
murmur by his bleeding country. But the wife of
a ganger who died on the 27th of the month
wasn’t allowed to draw her husband’s pay for the
remaining three days. Both events happened' in
the same province.
Secretary Burgess, of S.A. (bogus)
“Defence League The League is distinctly
opposed to the single-tax, progressive land-tax,
class domination of any kind, and the extremists
of the Labour-party.” Add to this that the
League goes for a “ progressive wealth tax ” alias
property-tax, and you have the Downer Ministry’s
anticipated policy.
Julian Salomons, the hysterical ex-Chief
Justice of N.S. W., remained in the Dibbs Adminis-
tration as long as there was any hope of squelching
One-man-one-vote. His ratting seemed timed for
the day when the One-man-one-vote clause was
coming on in the Nominee Council, and a motion
of censure, likely to be fatal, was expected to be
pending in the other House.
It is indeed hard to find out details
as to the salaries, etc., of N.S.W. civil ser-
vants. The late Crown Solicitor Williams was
down on the official papers as the recipient of
something like £l5OO a year. It took Lakeman,
M.L.A., years to wring from jjtlie authorities the
admission that Mr. Williams’ total official emolu-
ments were nearer £OOOO annually.
W. O. Hodgkinson, now of the Griffil-
wraith gang, wrote thus in June, 1890 :
—As for the reluctance of Queensland to inundate her
tropical territory with an alien and inferior race, are not
the consequences of such imprudence written in letters
of ruin and blood on the battlefields of the United Slates?
They are. And what has W.O.H. got to say now
that he is going to take his reward for preparing
the way for the like consequences here ?

The Argus says that a pleasing feature of
the Patterson Ministry is that only two of its
members—O’Loghlen and Richardson—support
One-man-one-vote.
Salomons and Dibbs have parted on bad
terms politically; but a public washing of minis-
terial dirty linen is postponed for the present.
This exhibition was quite expected by Dibbs, last
week, for he went to the trouble of sending a
shorthand writer into the Council gallery to take
a full note of Salomons’ statement. All this
trouble was superfluous as Salomons kept the cat
in the bag.
The Brisbane Courier’s biting article on
the disgraceful position now occupied by Griffith
as a self-appointed pluralist was evidently inspired
by The Bulletin’s paragraph in a recent issue,
having reference to Parkes’ dictum that the in-
stant a Premier decided to appoint himself to any
stipendiary Civil Service position, at that instant
his office as Premier became vacant —and all future
acts of his Ministry illegal.
N.S.W. Upper House unsuccessfully tried
to reduce the Assembly to 100 members under
the new Elections Act. Only roads and bridges
members would have objected. Nearly every
member of the Lower House is privately of opinion
that 125, like 141. is too great a membership for
a population of 1,140,000 or so. Great Britain’s
37| millions have 670 members ; France’s 38 mil-
lions, 584 deputies; Switzerland’s 3 millions, 145
members.
Let the test-vote for Australian Republi-
cans be on the question of passing a law, pro-
hibiting any Australian citizen from being recog-
nised legally under any titular distinction other
than one defining his occupation. Let anyone not
content with plain “Mister” cease to have the
privileges of Australian citizenship. If this were
so,-how many,_ if any, Australian “ my-ladys ”
would save their lords’*citizenship by graciously
acknowledging the humble “Madam ?”
W. G. Wilson, of Port Pirie, S.A., wrote
the following protest on the back of the Income-
tax return which he made under legal compulsion:
“Furnished under protest, the requirement to
furnish being an immoral one, demanded by a
Government representing an ignorant, enslaved
people, who permit the great fund of land-values,
created by themselves, to go into private pockets,
instead of into the State Treasury, thus requiring
immoral means of raising revenue to be resorted
to.”
It is alleged that there is not one Jew on
the share-list of the defunct Panama Canal Com-
pany. The Hebrew names are conspicuous among
the contractors, the financiers, the people who
supplied stores, who indented labourers, who sold
their votes and interest to the company, who took
commission in a thousand different ways from the
battered enterprise. But not one Israelite of
them all put his good red gold into the great ditch
which swallowed so many Gentile fortunes. When
the crash comes Abraham is never there.
With a look of deep displeasure on it*
intellectual face, Melbourne Age: “There is no
doubt that France has behaved in a very shabby
way to these colonies, by taking advantage of her
possession of an island in our neighbourhood to
turn it into a convict settlement.” Dear old
Hingland couldn't be guilty of such shabby
conduct. The idea of depositing her convicts in
the vicinity of free-born Australians until they,
the f.b. A.’s, began to grow restless, would never
have found standing-room in the Great British
brain.
The Queensland (1892) sugar season has
closed with better returns than in any previous
year. Who has benefited ? In the principal
centre, many men have not been able to get any
work at all, and among those who have been
employed on the plantations, the average wage
has not exceeded £1 a week, without rations.
The Times says that the Kanaka in Queensland is
better off than the English agricultural labourer.
It might have truthfully added that the Kanaka
is better off than the average white labourer in
Queensland.
W hen an article is brought forward and
all its patrons praise it, and allow that it possesses
the properties that the manufacturers claim for it,
and which possesses virtues and merits which are
universally acknowledged both by press and pub-
lic, such endorsement must really prove beyond
the slightest shadow of a doubt the intrinsic merit
of that article. Ihe unparalleled success which
has attended the introduction of Clements Tonic
to suffering mankind, and the universal praise
bestowed upon it by influential and well-known
persons in the community, conclusively prove
that this article is undoubtedly genuine. Clem-
ents Tonic has done more good in the last two
years in Australia than all the other medicines
put together can ever claim to have done, and
there is not a city, town, village, or street but
what there are people resident in who are willing
to testify to the wonderful efficacy of this re-
nowned remedy; for evidence comes to hand
proving this by every mail in letters similar to
that of Miss Trances INI. Cairns, Clengarry, Vic.,
who writes I have much pleasure in testifying
to the curative powers of Clements Tonic. I had
suffered from liver complaint and indigestion for
some years ; but the latter became so bad early in
1891 that I was obliged to get leave of absence
from my school duties for a month. I returned to
work, but was very little better. The most pro-
nounced symptoms were sleeplessness and severe
pain in the chest after eating the least morsel of
food. This pain commenced in the chest, passed
round the heart, and thence into my shoulder I
had read several of the testimonials re Clements
Tonic, and as yet I had not received any lasting
benefit from doctors, I decided to try it. By the
time 1 had taken one small bottle I was very
much better. The pain was less, I could sleep at
least part of the night, and I was not troubled
with the horrible dreams that had haunted me
when asleep. I continued taking it, and by the
tune I had taken three small bottles the pain was
gone, and the other symptoms with it. Since
then I have had one bad attack, during last
Christmas vacation. I again took Clements
lonic, and soon became quite well. Since then I
have not had any return of the indigestion, and at
this present time I feel much better than I have
done for years. I have no hesitation in saying
that Clements Tonic cured me. I was very ill so
ill that I could not have lived long in the state T
was in, and here I am to-day, well and strong
with a good appetite, and able to enjoy a good
night s rest, all of which I owe to Clements
tonic. I first took it about this time last year.
I might say, in conclusion, that I was very pre-
judiced against what some folks call “quack
medicines.” I had always called in medical aid.
—I remain, yours most thankfully, Frances M.
Cairns, Glengarry, Vic.

Lord Jersey says he did not apply for
leave of absence, because “he believed it would
not be. right to leave so large and important a
colony as N.S.W. without a Governor for any
length of time.” That’s the way with these vice-
regal gentlemen : they believe they are the gover-
nors on the national steam-engine, whilst they are
really only the brass filagree on the fire-box doors.
It was as The Bulletin conjectured. The
Governoresa sent in her resignation and the
Governor resigned himself to it.

Laboucheve says
of suicided Baron
Reinach : “Like most
financial men, he was
polygamous. In his
last letter to an ex-
director of the Opera
H onse, he begged of
him to ‘ kiss the dar-
lings of the corps de
ballet.’” Evidently,
then, Labouchere’s
experience would lead
him to believe a num-
ber of little stories
concerning A list alian
financial men, whose
polygamy is so strenu-
ously denied by their
old pals. And it is
a fact that few men
can make a rapid
fortune by shady
means without find-
ing more women than
a wife to help spend
it.

The residents of a Sydney suburb are now
getting used to seeing a “ through ” train, time-
tabled not to stop until it should arrive at a
distant station, slow down at the local platform
for the sole purpose of depositing thereon one
middle-aged matron, wife of a Cabinet Minister.
And yet we .are told that N.S.W. railway-
administration is quite beyond the reach of
political influence.
Within a couple of miles of Hall’s Gap in
the Grampian Ranges (Vic.) —the scene of the
boom-broke province’s pray-and-cuddle picnic—
live, in the heart of the hills, two maiden ladies
of curious pedigree and eccentric habits. They
are among the finest wild-flower painters in
Australia, and make a good income by painting
and illuminating presentation addresses for a
Melbourne stationery firm.

An interesting social item from the West.
A limb of the law was engaged to the daughter of
a wealthy land-owner and Legislative Councillor,
without the knowledge of the latter, who would
not on any consideration have given his assent.
The couple agreed to elope, an appointment being
made for the local railway-station to catch the
Sydney mail. The “ limb’s ” courage having, how-
ever, oozed out, he had word sent of the intended
elopement to the young lady’s father, who met
her at the railway-station and took her home to
ruminate on the fickleness of man.

The Judge at Glen Lines (N.S.W.)
Quarter Sessions, recently sentenced two men,
first offenders, who had pleaded guilty to robbery,
to three years penal servitude each, remarking
that if they conducted themselves well for ten or
eleven months they would be enabled to earn 12s.
per week for the remainder of the term. Twelve
shillings a week with food, clothing and lodging is,
in these days, surely offering a premium to theft.

Just listen. Mr. Aitken, the Sydney
Exchange Hotel Co.’s manager, the other day
advertised for a man at £1 a week and his keep to
look after the hotel donkey-engine. He had over
200 applicants, most of whom said that they were
competent, and many of whom produced evidence
of the fact. Some of them absolutely cried to be
allowed to stay and do the work in exchange for
their food and lodging only. Every day, the
manager says, he has a dozen or more men who
want to work for their food alone.

A correspondent: “As to ‘short and
natural Australian love-stories,’ perhaps the finest
is ‘ An Unseen Foe,’ contributed by ‘ Ada Cam-
bridge ’ (Airs. Cross) to the defunct Centenn'al
Magazine. It was short —it was true—and
Heaven knows, it was natural, inasmuch as the
woman was drowned a few days before marriage.
That’s the love-story that’s ‘natural.’ The fact
is, people don’tiwtn/ love-stories that end naturally.
They want’em to continue the hot, perspiring, love
business after marriage. That’s where they’re un-
natural.”

native girl from Ailinglapelap. Addressing the

HE: “That’s very sad about Mr. Brown. I wonder whatever drove him
to drink?”
SHE: “Well, I should say thirst!”
pompons missionary : “ Say, mister, can you

you won’t do the job you can go to blazes. So

with his olive-tinted lump of delight.
# * #
Yet another love story. A year and a
half ago the drunken captain of an island labour-
trading vessel, leaning over the bar of the Cafe
, in Noumea, was overheard by a Sydney
barrister hiccnping thus to the rowdy-looking
English barmaid : “ Look here, Nell, I'm a beast
and yon— -(Am?)— ain’t no better. I’ve lost my
berth, and if you’re agreeable I’ll kick my nigger-
girl out and make a decent woman of you, and
we’ll go and live where no one knows what you
are.”

The conversion of the borough of Port
Melbourne into a “ town ” (or city—the import of
either change is equally mighty) gave the local
Mayor a chance to beat the record in municipal
grovel. This happy man “alluded with .pride to
the fact that he had been his Excellency’s ship-
mate in coming to the colony, and had that day
had the honour of riding in the same carriage with
him.” The fervour of the little potentate’s utter-
ance suggested that he would willingly lay down
his life for Hopetoun if his bones might ultimately
be stowed away in his lordship’s own private box.

There is a mysterious something in the
Australian climate which causes every Governor’s
wife to suffer from “indifferent health.”
Editor Bulletin,—
In re The Bulletin’s
remarks as to the con-
fused decisions in Vic-
toria about . a wife’s
right to sue for divorce
when her husband is
not locally domiciled,
the Vic. case of Ho-a-
mie versus Ho-a-mie,
tried some years ago,
and reported in 6 Vic.
Reports, p. 113, is in-
teresting. A China-
man married an Aus-
tralian girl in Vic-
toria ; afterwards de-
serted her, went to
China, married a
Chinese woman, and
established a Chinese
domicile. The Victorian
wife followed him there,
but got no satisfaction
and returned to Mel-
bourne, where she insti-
tuted divorce proceed-
ings. The court granted
the divorce, and ruled
that although the domi-
cile of a husband is
the domicile of bis
wife, yet if the hus-
band purposely changes
his domicile to injure
the wife, the wife may
sue for a divorce in the
courts of the matri-
monial domicile. —G. A.

Most Australian city churches now issue

One of the wealthiest (as regards its con-

An assault case in Adelaide police-court
last week disclosed these facts. A Sunday-school
teacher and a choir-singer “ got mashed on ” the

morn the chorister invited the teacher out from

You don’t think what a lot of practice it takes to

Dear Bulletin, —You ask for short love-
tales. Here’s one. I once, in a Welsh farm-house,
started reading aloud to a native woman the
“Rime of the Ancient Mariner,” which contains
not a solitary word about a woman. Knowing
little English, my auditor was deceived by the

Unsavoury, but true. A N.S.W. Legisla-

was ill and his doctor made it a condition of his

Queen Victoria may shortly be repre-
sented in N.S.W. by (apt name !) John Lackey.
So far as The Bulletin remembers, no successor
has yet been named to Alfred Stephen as Lieut.-
Governqr ; and, in default of such appointment,
John Lackey will assume the vacant Governorship
under the open commission which was issued in
1879 to the President of the Legislative Council as
a sequel to the Robinson-Martin embroilment.
Lackey cannot well hold on to the President’s
chair while he is administering the Government.
How can he fill both billets without bringing one
office or the other, or both, into contempt ? How
can he, for instance, when the day comes for pro-
roguing or dissolving Parliament “in person,”
walk solemnly to the steps outside the Council
chamber and, as President of the Council, receive
himself, as Victoria’s representative, and then,
being seated in the Governor’s chair, or the Presi-
dent’s chair, or both, how can he, as Administra-
tor, order himself, as President, to send Black Rod
along for the Legislative Assembly? And,
finally, how can he, as Administrator, after read-
ing the Speech from an imaginary Throne, bow
himself off the premises, and in the course of two
seconds come back as President and receive the
Speaker’s obeisance as he leads out the Commons,
and then report to the Council that he, as Admin-
istrator, had been pleased to deliver a speech, &c.?

Humphries, the defaulting secretary of
the Vic. Employers’ Union, cut his connection
with Capital in the most suitable manner possible.
He shaved off his board and dressed himself as a
working-man—
Over two months ago, a youngster escaped
from Nudgee (Bris.) Orphanage, and stole a horse,
saddle and bridle. Hue and cry was raised, but
he safely remained in the thickly-populated suburb
of Fortitude Valley, brazenly riding the stolen
horse daily in the main streets of the city itself.
And the alert detectives would never have found
out even that much, had the boy not left his

LINES TO A NOBLE FRIEND.
Well, Jersey, if depart you must,
Financial matters to “adjust,”
We’ll grieve to say “ Good morning.”
Despite your whiskers and your hair
We learned to love you pretty fair,
And never caught you yawning.
The earl who sticks to such a hat
Doth not incite the democrat
To curse creation madly ;
And, if the tailor makes the man,
Your’s made you on a simple plan
(And cut the trousers badly).
No jingo altitudes you’ve struck,
Nor made believe to push a truck,
And seem unduly chummy ;
You seldom talked Britannia “ rot,”
You didn’t tell the people what
A friend you had in Tummy.
No old official Loftus style
Have you inflicted on us, while
In tanks you masqueraded ;
Nor with a ghastly gallows crime
(The fruit of early convict time)
Shall Jersey be upbraided.
In short, although ’tis very true,
There’s little for a Gov. to do,
And what he does is nonsense.
At seven thousand pounds a year
We (this is funny) held you dear,
Yet rather cheap, in one sense.
Lord Jersey, tell yer what it is
Our gaudy snobs do shady biz—
The fellows can’t be trusted ;
Now you deserve your noble rank
F’or being partner in a bank
Which hasn’t gone and busted.
We would we were a harmless lord
With stocks and shares and acres broad,
And agents rent-collecting.
A coronet upon our brow !
And oh !—excuse us stopping now,
The subject’s too affecting.
Have they shown great circumspection in arranging that
collection,
Or gone straight for facts, and fixed them with a legend
underneath,
To prove “ law’n order ” stifles labour troubles here with
rifles ?
Do they give a speaking likeness of the cropped and
handcuffed Sleath ?
Do they picture the Kanaka in his paradise of “ bacca ”
And rum, amongst the planters where the sugar-cane is
grown,
And the whites who’re “broke” and stranded, in the
cities grimly banded,
Or all sleeping in the moonlight, softly pillowed on a
stone?
Do they add a cartoon truthful wherein thousands old
and youthful
Who’ve been killed or badly crippled in the fall of banks
are shown ?
Have they views of arid acres that at present have no
takers,
And of green and grassy valleys that the wealthy
grabbers own ?
Not a bit! The views that suited without shades were
executed,
And show landscapes ever smiling and a prospect all
serene,
Or fat people, clean and sunny, in a land of oil and honey,
Where the skies are always cloudless and the fields are
very green.
But the British workman, seeing he is pictured as a
being
Of beauty blessed with peace himself, will, if he’s any
brains,
Treat these pictures as deceiving, and be wary of
believing
Any views of Australasia that the Baron entertains.
Whilst Humphries represented Cash
And had the Argus for a pal,
He wore the hat and garments flash
Of one whose cry is “Capital !’’
For which his ready tongue and pen
Were fighting bravely night and day ;
He scorned those “dogs” of working-men
And laughed to see them “ lose the day.”
Corrupted by the smell of wealth
(Let circumstances take the blame),
Poor Humphries slunk away by stealth,
Intending to disguise his shame.
Thought he, “ I'm going to the dogs,
I’ve done with the Employers’ elan.”
He clothed himself in common togs,
And called himself—a working-man.

At Auckland (M L.) recently a little girl
fell into the fire, and was removed to the hospital
in an almost hopeless condition. She ultimately
recovered, but it was necessary to graft new skin
on the surfaces where the cuticle had been
destroyed, and for this purpose 150 bits of skin
with occasional scraps of flesh adhering were
snipped off one of the female nurses. A local
paper started to enthuse over this noble sacrifice
on the lady’s part, and then learned, to its horror,
that it was simply part of her regular work—when
any such case occurs the doctor selects some
member of the staff and takes from him or her
what skin he wants as a matter of course. There-
fore, the lady has practically no say in the matter,
and apparently it isn’t even considered in her
wages. Presumably the staff takes turns at the
work, though if the doctor had a disagreement,
say, with one of the nurses, he could always get
level by taking more skin off her than off the
others.

Crawlalong.
(FOR THE BULLETIN.)
The “township” of Crawlalong lies “out-
back.” It is so often mentioned in stock reports
that city people regard it as being quite an
important place. The traveller, on first arriving
there, will most likely ask the coachdriver how
much further it is to Crawlalong ; and the driver
will answer, with a twinkle in his eye :
“This is it!”
The principal buildings are “The Carriers’
Arms,” the blacksmith’s shop, the “Commercial
Stores,” and a weather-board box, roofed with
galvanized iron, and called a “cottage.” The
main street is that portion of the Government
road extending from the blacksmith’s shop to the
pub.—about 50 yards. The smithy is a slab shed
with a flat, bark roof and kerosene-tin flue. The
pub. is a low, weatherboard building with a very
low verandah round two sides, and a door in the
corner. The verandah slouches down over the
door and windows like the hat of the common back-
lane variety of larrikin. The bar is low, dark,
dingy, and altogether evil-looking. The sinister
doors and windows look furtively out from under
the verandah—like the eyes of the aforesaid
larrikin scowling under his hat-brim.
The water-supply of Crawlalong is invisible.
The town’s average temperature is Sheol in the
shade. Visible population : Two men going in to
have a drink, and a drunkard lying bareheaded in
the blazing heat by the dusty roadside. Trade :
A bullock-team and a hawker’s waggonette stand-
ing outside the “Carriers’ Arms.” Politics:
Freetrade and Protection. Religion : Liquor and
horse-racing. Church : The “ Carriers’ Arms:”
Principal Imports : Beer, rum, brandy, whisky,
gin, flour, tea, and sugar. Exports: Dead
drunkards—as far as the cemetery. Products :
Jim-jams. Chief Industry; “Lambing-down.”
Principal occupation of population when not dead-
drunk : Fighting three luke-warm rounds fear-
fully, and shaking hands afterwards with great
enthusiasm.
* « *
The town is supported by a few old shearers
who come there regularly to be shorn. The
government is communistic to a certain extent, and
“liberty prevails,” but the law of the land is
represented by two mounted troopers who visit
the place about once a year, and borrow—in the
Queen’s name—a horse and dray and pick and
shovel from the local blacksmith, and bury the
remains of any dead bushmen that may be lying
round.

Dear Bulletin, —
Re the New Australia
scheme. I have just
received a letter from
Argentina, written by
a man who has excep-
tional opportunities for
observation. The fol-
lowing extracts are
worth your notice
“Like all South Ameri-
can Republics, we are
in a continual state of
muddle. Every other
day there is a bank
failure or a revolution.
At the time of writing
(April 7th, 1892), the
country is declared to
be in a state of siege,
and the leaders of the
Radical party are in
prison. This is said to
be only a dodge to get
them out of the way
while a now President
is elected. After that,
we shall either settle
down quietly or have a
revolution. Now, with
regard to business. I
would strongly advise
you not to come to this
country, as things at
present are in a fearful
state, and the railways,
etc., are on the verge of
bankruptcy. The cur-
rency is greatly depreci-
ated. With regard to
camp (bush) life, the
pay is simply wretched ;
about 30s. a month,
and very few English
fellows go to the camp,
and then only to gain
experience, with a view
of taking up land. It
is very hard to get on
with the natives, how-
ever well you speak
their lingo. Their ways
are so different, and, I
may say, dirty. Later :
I have just seen in the
papers that the leaders
of the Radical patty
are to be exiled to an
island near the Magel-
lan Straits. To-day
(April 10) the elections
took place, but only one party went to the poll
the others were afraid of a row, and kept safely to
their homes. How would that style suit the
kangaroos ? I may tell you that it is only Argem
tines who cai’e to take any part in politics, and
Argentines are only those born in the country ; so
you see foreigners cannot take any interest in the
affairs, and never talk politics. There is not much
opening, therefore, for a man like B here.
The worst thing about the climate are the storms,
or pamperos. When one of these is in full blast
you have to look out, for houses go down like
cards (the houses are built chiefly of mud), and the
wind is so strong as to stop trains. It is no un-
common thing to see the guards’ reports with
‘ two hours detained by heavy wind, as the ex-
planation of delay,”—C.R., Melb.

Our Ambassador; or, Sharp Practice on
the Darling.
(FOR THE BULLETIN.)
There is an old, furthest-out bushman who
comes to Sydney once every year and always calls
upon certain members of the staff of this paper.
He seems to regard himself as an ambassador
from the backblocks, and he lays down the law on
all bush subjects in great style. He is a bearded,
freckled old pirate, with a bald-head. His hands
are scarred with “ Barcoo rot.” There are not
many parts of Australia that the ancient doesn’t
know; and to hear him chin off the bush
names is a perfect treat. He has a slightly Scotch
accent, and he was at first suspected of being
“Scotty the Wrinkler ” in disguise, come “to take
a rise ” out of us. He always has a backblock
story or two which he thinks would be highly
suitable for publication. They never are. They
mostly consist of yarns about the things which
some renowned bullock-driver said to his bullocks
when he was fast in a river with a flood coming
down. Or else he tells how, out in the far-back
country, the supplies got low and the only flour
available was full of weevils and other live stock, and
the storekeeper used to classify the flour according
to the condition of the creeping things which in-
habited it. The fatter the crawlers were, the
better quality the flour was held to be, so that
“ prime fat flour ” sold at a considerable advance
over that which was only in “store condition.”
His great idea is to have these stories illustrated,
a process to which they do not lend themselves
readily. But when he came to town this last time
he was so genuinely distressed at none of his
previous yarns having appeared that he was
promised faithfully that “Sharp practice on the
Darling ” should be published, even if the editor
had to be knocked on the head.

said, “ with cattle. And cornin’ down in the

baker last week as I told you!”
MARY : “Well no, Mum. You see it ain’t convenient just now, as I’m
expecting him to declare himself any morning.”
way now. There’s some tremenjus funny things
in the bush, you know.”
“Yes,” we said. “What is the funniest thing
that has happened lately ?”
“Well,” he replied, “ we reckoned this was the
funniest. We talked over a crowd of things in
the camp, but we reckoned this was the best. It
would make good pictures, too,” he said, earnestly.
“We call it sharp practice on the Darlin’River
just now, and if a man has a fi’ pun’-note he can’t
get past a public-house with his life, you know.
They’ll get that fiver out of him, somehow. But
there was a mate of mine that took ’em down all
right ’’—and the old man chuckled at the remem-
brance.
“ How did he take ’em down? Did he swallow
the fiver and then cough it up after he got past the
hotel ?” we enquired.
“No,” he said. “When he went to the pub. he
had three fivers, and he gave the landlord two of
’em, and started a spree. So I come along and
was havin’ a drink with him, and he showed me
the other fiver. ‘ I’m goin’ to get away with this
one,’ says he. ‘ Does the publican know you’ve
got it ?' says I. ‘Yes,’ says he. ‘ Well, he’ll have
it off you somehow,’ I says. ‘ There’s no publican
on the Darlin’ River has let a man with five
pounds get past him this seven years,’ I says,
‘and you ain’t goin’ to be the fust man to do it.’
‘ Won’t I?’ says he. ‘ You see, now, I’ll get away
with it all right.’
“So, when he’d about cut out his ten pounds,
he slips down to the river one day, and takes the
canoe, and paddles across, and makes off down the
river to strike the coach road. The publican come
out and ‘ Where’s Hazard gone?’ says he. Hazard
was the name this mate of mine went by, and he
was a tremenjus clever fellow—a real larrikin. ‘ I
don’t know,’says I, ‘ where he’s gone.’ ‘Well,
says the publican, ‘he owes me some money and
I must have him back.’ So he calls two chaps ha
had there, and he sends one to swim the river
with a horse and go down the further side, and tha
other to go down the near side, and they was
bound to have him that way. So Hazard, he was
makin’ down the river and he saw this cove cross
over after him, and just then there was a steamer
coming up the river. And he didn’t want to go
up the river, you know, but it was any port in a
storm with him, so he runs to the bank and waves
his swag, and the steamer sent a boat and took
him off. And as he went up past the public-house
he saw the landlord standing there, and he ran to
the stern of the steamer and waved the fi-pun note
at him. ‘Ha! ha! old man,’ he says, ‘this is
sharp practice on the Darling !’ ”
* * *
We agreed that this story would appeal
strongly to bush readers. We also took notes
of another narrative about a publican and a
boozer. In this case the boozer had some pound
notes and he let them blow out of his hand in the
yard on a windy day, and then he, and the
publican, and a retriever pup, were down on all-
fours together in the dirt grabbing at the notes as
they blew about. The puppy secured the bulk of
the capital. The old man pointed out that this
would make a spirited illustration, and we
promised to have a full-page drawing made of it
when the artists had time. He went on to,chat
about things in general,
“About this Argentina scheme, now,” he said,
“ you fellows in Sydney don’t think that the bush-
men are in earnest over that.”
“Well, are they’” we enquired. “It doesn’t
look a very good game to leave this country and
go to a strange place where they’ll get potted like
’possums in the first revolution.”
“Ah, well, they’re in earnest about it,” he said,
“ I’m not going myself, but there was six men at
the last shed I was at that are going, and they
have put down their stuff, too. It seems a pity,
don’t it, for them to go away. Fine strappin’
young fellows as the sun ever shone on ! But it’s
terrible hard to get a livin’ these times.” he said,
“ if you go shearing and get one shed it’s all you’ll
do. And in the old times they was glad to get
shearers. If it wasn’t for the rabbits there’d bo
no work at all on a lot of the runs.”
“Yes, they’re too clever for men to keep out,”
he answered ; “they burrows under the wire nett-
ing, and they can’t be stuffocated in their burrows
nohow, ’cos they camp out under the saltbush
these times. And they crosses the Murray River
where it’s a quarter of a mile wide.”
“ Oh, come ! that’s too stiff. You don’t tell us
the rabbits can swim a quarter of a mile ? ”
“ In corse they don’t,” he said ; “ they burrows
underneath it! ”
After that we took him out and stood him a
drink, and sent him on his way rejoicing.

Editor Bulletin, —Captain Mackay’s re-
marks quoted in last week’s Bulletin re the
little island of Tucopia offering a field for mis-
sionary enterprise may possibly be the means of
sending some good man, eager to further exploit
the Lord’s Vineyard, on a soulless chase, and this,
no doubt, would pain The Bulletin. He, would
be too late, for both on isolated Tucopia and
Anouda (Cherry Island) there are resident native
teachers of the usual sort manufactured in the
Fijian and Tongan training schools, white-shirted,
sulu’d, and neck-tied, oleaginous, canting and
dollar - grabbing. It would be a hard matter
now to find any island where living is good
and money to be collected (or its equivalent in
copra) where you won’t find a native missionary—
especially does this apply to Polynesia. Of
Melanesia these gentry are rather shy, there being
too much club and spear and too little harvest.
Some of the teachers, however, are very good
fellows—especially the L.M.S. Samoans in the
Ellice and Line Islands—with a noted pen-
chant for filling their houses with the best local
beauty as servants, nurses, etc. When the first
Samoan teacher landed on Nanomaga (Hudson’s
Island), in the Ellice Group, a meeting was called
of the “Kaupule” (town council) and the following
rigid laws passed :
Neglecting to attend daily morning prayers, flue of
sdols. (one-half to go to teacher).
Neglecting to attend Sabbath-day service, fine of Sdols.

And so on ad infinitum. In the course of a few
months the teacher’s stipend had grown fat,
doubling his income of 100 dols. from Gospel
headquarters. Then, as most of the young men
and girls were hopelessly insolvent and plunged
up to the necks in fines (not, it is hardly necessary
to state, through any infringement of religious
observances), the teacher went back to Samoa, and
a smart, active young fellow came with a pretty
young wife and inducted some sense into the
“Kaupule,” doing away with all fanaticism and
teaching them to" live cleanly. As showing the
innate honesty of these people, a trader who lived
there nearly two years with a large stock of goods
lying about loose in a native-built house without
either doors or keys, states that he never had one
cent’s worth stolen from him. Everyone on the
island came in and went out as they pleased.—B.

It is cabled that Mr. George Goschen,'
late private secretary to Gov. Jersey, has been
married to Miss Evelyn Gathorne Hardy. By
the way, there are some queer rumours afloat as
to the amatory exploits of certain young gentle-
men in a certain Government House circle.
Blaine, whose death is cabled, illustrated
Emerson’s saying, “The more you take away
from a great man, the greater he is.” He was
foiled for the Presidency by Hayes, Garfield,
Cleveland, Harrison, and again this time. Yet
he always went one higher. He grasped the full
meaning of Gladstone’s saying, that in 1993 the
U.S. will have 500 million people. Beyond
Monroe doctrine he went, and unwisely, in trying
to annex Hawaii, Cuba, and Hayti, but otherwise
his ideas about American unity were noble —all
North and South America to be one.
N.S. VY. Treasurer See, in his financial
statement, mentioned that the revenue derived
from spirits showed a decrease of £36,000 during
the last year. Yet no one seems to know where
the shortage comes in. The old-established
brands show no falling off in consumption if we
may judge from the following statistics : During
the past week Messrs. Sandeman, the agents for
John Robertson & Sons’ famous JDR whisky,
have imported 5000 cases, equalling 10,000 gallons,
or 60,000 bottles. If all these bottles were put in
line they would reach from the G.P.0., Sydney,
to Parramatta, and the corks alone would extend
from Sydney G.P.O. to Redfern Railway Station.
When we consider that there are numerous other
brands in consumption the question arises : what
distance would they all reach if put in one line ?
No one but a profound mathematician refreshed
with the non-headache-producing JDR whisky
could tackle such a problem and come out alive at
the other end.
Dear 1 Bulletin,—l notice in Bulletin
just to hand, a letter from “Teamster,” tdbching
the camel question. Let me, as a digger, give my
views on the subject. The four teams that left
the Cross to cut the road to Gnarlbine, “120
miles,” charged .£ll2 per ton. They got to their
journey’s end in two weeks, and used neither
shovel nor axe upon the way ; and they tried to
keep up this monstrous imposition. Had it not
been for the camels taking loading from York at
4d. per lb. (300 miles), they would have succeeded,
too. The horses are a perfect nuisance : they
drink the water-holes dry, and hang over the holes
when unable to help themselves. The poor things
beg a drink from each man who bales a billy of
water. This occurred on my way down. The
teams drive tandem. One particular team had
not watered for two whole days. When we over-
took two swagsman with full bags of water, the
horses, smelling it, encircled the men, and took
not the slightest heed of the driver’s “gee-up.”
The men parted a drink for the poor nags, which
carried them on to more water. Every digger here
who can afford it, dispenses with his horse and gets
a camel. I have found teamsters (i.e., natives) the
grandest, bravest and most generous of men, but
the old Greenlander, with the harvest stubble
round his jaw, and the cockney Jew, are such
natural usurers, that they cannot recognise their
impostures, believing themselves to be the most
liberal-minded drivers on the road. — Fossioker.
Southern Cross, Westralia, Jan. 18, 1893.
IT’S GONE, ALL GONE, AND I’M GOING
TOO.
For many a year did the same man sweep a
certain street-crossing in Hampstead. Through
all seasons and in all weathers, there he was,
sweeping the crossing and taking such gratuities
as were given him. Time wore away, and he came
to be eighty years old. He appeared at his post
no more. A lady district visitor looked him up at
his lodgings. What a picture of squalid destitu-
tion. No fire, no food, no friends. Wife and
family he had none—never had. The poor old
fellow was perishing of starvation, of want. Borne
money was raised for his benefit and he was re-
moved to a London hospital. Here he lay several
weeks, sinking daily. One night he was clearly
very low. Near him stood one of the hospital
physicians and a nurse. Seeing him clutch
nervously at his pillow, the nurse, supposing the
patient desired to be raised up, put his arm.
beneath him to perform that service. In doing
so the nurse’s hand came in contact with an
object which he withdrew. It was a dirty little
canvas bag tied with a leather string. As it was
laid aside the old man perceived what had been
done, lifted his skeleton frame partially from the
bed and, trembling with excitement, said in a
shrill whisper, “Ah ! my treasure, my treasure !
It’s gone, all gone, and I’m going too !’’ and sank
back dead. The bag contained <£soo in notes —
the savings of his miserly life. And he, there,
dead of starvation, even more than of age. Well,
what of it ? you say. The wretched old man was
better dead than alive. Quite so, but most
human events have a moral, a lesson, about them,
if we keep an eye out for it.
What, for example, can we learn from the
following facts ? —One night about ten years ago a
man, whose name we can furnish, went to bed as
usual, apparently in good health and spirits. A
few hours later he lay unconscious on the floor.
In explanation he stated that he had been seized,
suddenly, with a pain of such violence that he was
compelled to rise—a pain in the chest. After
rising he lost his senses and sank down on the
spot where he had stood. His wife, aroused by
the noise, struck a light and saw her husband in
that situation. She afterwards declared he had
gone black in the face, and that his eyes looked as
if they were starting out of his head.
Restoratives were applied which brought him
to, but he was not as before. So quickly and un-
expectedly do we cross the boundary line between
two opposite bodily conditions. It is like
stepping from the broad blaze of day into a damp
cavern packed with darkness. He felt weak and
sick, with a strange “all-gone” sensation through-
out his whole system. His mouth tasted badly,
and was filled with a slimy sort of phlegm, his
head ached, he was unable to draw a deep breath,
he walked with difficulty, and went about his
business like a man who is haunted by a para-
lysing dream.
Perplexed and alarmed he consulted physicians,
who prescribed for him, without, however, pro-
ducing any noticeable improvement. The strong,
clear-headed man of previous years was gone—
changed as by the wand of a vicious magician into
the feeble being he now was. Even with this
dismal prospect before him our friend travelled
not on level ground ; his path led downward ; he
grew worse. In December, 1888, he had a dis-
tinct and bad attack, gave up business, and went
to bed. There he remained for a weary painful
month—thirty days, as long as thirty years of
power and occupation. The doctor said there was
something wrong with the stomach and bowels.
After he once more rose from his bed he still
suffered dreadful pain and could rest neither day
or night. Indeed, some nights he never slept a
moment. So weak had he become that when he
attempted a short walk he was obliged to aban-
don the effort, return and go to bed.
His own words are these: —“To give you an
idea how reduced I had become I may mention
that I lost over three stone weight and was wast-
ing away. I kept on like this until January,
1891, when Mr. Everson, of Occold, told me of a
medicine called Mother Seigel’s Syrup and the
good it had done. I tried it and in three days I
felt better. Cheered and encouraged by this I
continued to use it, with the result that I wholly
recovered from my mysterious malady. lam now
strong and hearty, and business is again a
pleasure. The Syrup did me more good in a few
weeks than all my ten years doctoring put to-
gether.” (Signed) Albert Thorndyke, Proprietor
of the “Grapes Inn,” Church Street, Eye,
Suffolk. May Ist, 1891.
What do we learn from this? We learn that
while a miserly fool like our crossing-sweeper may
starve for money, a wise man with more reverence
for his bodily temple, seeks and finds a remedy
for a tendency to starvation , induced by disease —
that the disease was indigestion and dyspepsia,
and the remedy Mother Seigel’s Syrup.


A fine constitution may be ruined by simple
neglect. Many bodily ills result from habitual
constipation. There is no medicine equal to
Ayer’s Pills for restoring the system to natural
and healthy action.

This is a business announcement, and that is
just the reason why you should read it right
through. One of the greatest
SECRETS OF THE DAY
is to successfully combat diseases and attain to a
serene and comfortable old age. Strategy is the
greatest
ART OF WAR.
By the aid of strategy you can get the enemy into
a fog and lose him there. Of course it is not con-
sidered strategy to find him again. But no
matter. A vegetarian tract recently published
imparts the cheerful intelligence that more people
are killed or disabled by
EXCESSIVE EATING
than by drink. This is, doubtless, true. Take
the tramp, for instance, who lives principally on
suction, and see how hardy he is. His excuse for
drinking is that it aids digestion. You can get
trichinosis from eating pork, he tells you, but not
from
DRINKING BEER.
About the only thing you can drink that is
really injurious to health is water. When you
move into a strange city you are generally advised
to “look out for the water.’’ The best way to
carry this instruction into execution is to inquire
for whisky at the threepenny bars.
NO SANE MAN,
however, will think of drinking St. Jacobs Oil,
because it is not a beverage for internal use. But
if he is troubled with neuralgia or rheumatism, or
is of
AN ACHING TOOTH,
a cold on the chest, or a sprained foot, reason will
dictate to him that an external remedy such as St.
Jacobs Oil, which never fails to effect a speedy
and permanent cure, is worth
A MILLION OF MONEY.
No other specific ever placed in the trade has
met with such unprecedented success, a fact which
is verified by the numberless testimonials re-
ceived proclaiming its sterling value. It is beyond
doubt the
BEST DOMESTIC REMEDY
that can be kept in the hduse, whether the home
be that of a merchant prince or the humble son of
toil.

SPORTING NOTIONS.
Eight hundred pounds taken at Sydney Asso-
ciation Ground sates on Thursday last, the opening day
of the Victoria-New South Wales match. After this, the
authorities might well think about erecting seme kind ot
shelter from the blazing sun for the “ bob-a-head ’ oontin-
jrent—a sort of a leger stand, as it were. The old Albert
Ground used to boast of a covering for the rank and file,
and, considering the tenure on which the Association holds
a portion of the people’s park, they might now give the
palatial structures for their own comfort a small rest and
put up some sort of a cowshed for the crowd who actually
keep the game going.
* * ■*
The feature of the Interprovincial match was
Coningham’s play. He obtained a splendid average in
bowling against first-class men on very good wickets. His
method seemed to be to deliver three or four over-arm
balls of medium pace, and then to suddenly whizz in a
round-armer at tremendous speed. He clean-bowled most
of his victims in this way, and several times sent the
stumps flying out of the ground. He certainly should be
taken to England with our Eleven, as he is a man of
splendid physique and an enthusiastic cricketer. His
style of bowling should suit the wet wickets of England.
* * *
Iredale was not given a chance to show his
bowling abilities against the Victorians. This is strange,
as changes in the bowling were constantly tried and he
has a good recoid as a change bowler. Can it be that the
fact of hi's not belonging to the Carlton club had anything
to do with it? His batting was first class, quite equal to
Graham’s, and if the Australian Eleven were being picked
on its merits instead of on a family basis Iredale would
certainly be selected.
* * *
Pierce holds the position of gatekeeper at the
Hospital for Lunatics, at Gladesvilie. He will have the
job of locking Coiiingham up one of these days, to judge
by the latter’s antics in the field.
# * *
Fielding is the weak point of N.S.W. cricket.
Good batsmen and bowlers are ot no avail while execrable
fielding gives the opposing eleven life after life. The good
field who saves 40 runs, but goes out for a duck, is of
more service to his side than the brilliant bat who scores
39, but gives4o to his opponents by loose fielding.
# * *
For instance, ere Bruce had scored a run in
Victoria’s second innings he should have been run but,
but Pierce and Wales mulled the chance between them.
This piece of loose fielding alone gave the Victorians 86
runs.
• • *
In the second innings of the Victorians, leaving
out the chance Bruce gave Pierce and Wales before he had
scored, he was missed by Pierce when his score stood at
eio-iit • Trott was missed by Coningham before he had
made a run; Barrett was missed by Callaway before he
scored; and Graham was missed by Pierce when he had
six to his credit. These were all reasonable chances, and
had they been taken the Victorian score would just have
totalled 50.
# * *
Pierce’s laziness in the field —or, more properly
speaking his affectation of laziness—should for ever
debar him from inclusion in a representative team.
Pierce’s general cricket is not of a sufficiently high order
to allow of him airing a fad in the field.
•. • •
The fates seemed altogether against New South
Wales. After being 70 runs behind in the first innings,
their chances were spoilt by wet weather, and in the
result “ Wales ” was defeated by 232 runs.
* * *
Bruce and M‘Leod took a lot of “pressing”
before consenting to go to Sydney. They “ didn I like to
be so often away from the bank.” Which workmanlike
sentiment getting whispered in the right quarter, a
deputation of M.C.C. officials to Frank Grey Smith,
manager of the bank and president of the club, resu Itha
in the granting of what is euphemistically called
“ accountant’s leave, ** and —‘‘ Messrs. Bruce and M Leod
were induced to alter their minds.”
* # *
A. E. Trott, brother of Harry, plays also for
South Melbourne, and generally keeps his end up while
the international min hits. Meanwhile, the proud father
officiates in the scoring-box, and follows the operations of
his offspring with snatches of soliloquy; “ Another 4 to
Harry -2 to Harry-missed that one—that’s an uppish
one I'll talk to him to-night about it—a single to Albert
Edward-4 to Harry, that boy plays as well to-day as lie
did four years ago ; Pd talk about him if he was a
perfect stranger—another single to Albert Edward—3 to
Harry.” Small hoy puls his head in: “’Ow many’s
’Any Trott now?” ‘‘Ninety-eight, my boy—another
single to Albert Edward-200 up—all the way I—4 to
Harrv— made his hundred ! Ha!”
* * *
George Giffen was once employed in the pub-
lishing department ot S. A, Advertiser.
* * *
George Giffen works in the S. A. General Post-
office and can he spared at any time without interfering
with the efficiency of the department. Walter Giffen
makes meters for the S.A. Gas Co. and cannot be given
holidays without causing inconvenience. That is why he
didn’t play in the recent interprovincial matches.
# # *
George Giffcn’s club average is, at present, 11)9
for 4 innings ; twice not out. Giffen has made 189 and
172 not out this season. Walter, the other day, made 5,
run out.
# # *
The writer gets this on splendid authority ; If
Walter Giffen does not go to England, George doesn’t go.
This settles any doubts about an understanding as to
George’s terms, which the selection committee quite
understood when Walter was picked.
# # *
“ Huge ” Trumble ran up a pair of duck-eggs in
the S.A. match—bowled third ball by Jones each innings
—but no one shrieks against his selection for England on
account of “lost form.” Yet several of the Australian
Eleven, as at present picked, have been decried because
of small scores in one or two recent matches—notably
Bannerraan.
# * *
“Jim” Barron has beaten another man in
America, and is slowly working bis way to better things.
Barron was no pick-up before be left Sydney, where he
found it hard work to find “ tucker ” for self and family,
but Barron, well nourished and trained, should make it
sultry for the best of his weight, wherever they may hail
from.
# * *
The “ respectable” press of Melbourne has at
last taken up The Bulletis’s cry that cronk racehorse
owners are “ killing the goose that lays the golden eggs.
Says the Argus; “Latterly, patrons of the sport have
become thoroughly disgusted with the questionable pro-
ceedings witnessed in connection with racing on every one
of the metropolitan courses, and the attendances have, as
a consequence, fallen off.” No habit grows upon rational
business men faster than that of stopping away from race-
meetings, and now that barefaced swindles are the rule,
even at Fkmington, the uninitiated public, which used to
get some fnn for its money whilst James White was
alive, seems to be stopping away altogether. The result of
this falling off in the supply of punters’ cash is a general
tendency towards insolvency among the rogues, who needs
must swindle more and more to earn their daily bred.

A Wentworth correspondent of an Adelaide
(S. A.) paper tells a racing yarn of the sixties, when John
Crozier had Kulnine station, on the Murray. John
wanted to time the speed of a horse named Phantom,
which he had bought and taken up from Gawler tor some
local races. One Kennedy assisted. Joe Langcake was
jockey. Crozier stood, stopwatch in hand, listening for
the voice of Kennedy. Sure enough, the latter presently
sang out: “ He’s off ! he’s off !” “Right!” called Crozier,
“I’ve got him.” “ But I say he’s off!” “Yes, and I say
i’ve got him all right.” “ I’m blessed if you have. He s

The Indian game of polo is becoming the
fashionable amusement in Sydney and Melbourne. It is
somewhat more risky than steeplechasing. So far, in
Sydney, the main casualties have been an aide-de-camp
lamed, probably for life, a lawyer severely hurt m the
eye, and a newspaper owner’s forehead laid open- In
Melbourne, one man got his nose knocked absolutely flat
with his face, and a spectator got his leg broken through
merely looking on at a match. A team of Indian ofnceis
proposes to come out and show “ the colonials all about
this wild amusement. In India, they kill two or three
men a year at it. In N.S. W., theMonaro men havefoimed
a club at Cooma, and once they get fairly going, the
“men from Snowy River ” will make the Indians ride for
their lives. There are no better ponies in the world than
the mountain-bred ponies of Monaro, and no better riders
than the Monaro men.

A Sydney Sunday paper says “the mistake

always has been. Mr. Rouse, breeder ot Little Bernie,
has a horse called Cheviot, who is by Adventurer, but
who is in mo way responsible for Little Bernie s existence.

Opinions of the Press.
Proving the Wonderful ALFALINE REMEDIES to
be Genuine.
“Herr Rasmussen’s, the celebrated Danish Herbalist,
well-known Herbal Remedies have been the means of per-
forming many great cures during the last few years, as his
numerous testimonials will prove.’’—Sydney Bulletin.
“ Herr Rassmussen has shown us some highly compli-
mentary Testimonials which he has received certifying to
important cures effected by his remedies.” —Sydney Evening
News.
“Herr Rassmussen counts the cures effected by his
Remedies by thousands, has already acquired an Australian
Reputation, and has secured the respect and gratitude of
numerous patients whom his Remedies have restored to
Health and Happiness.’’—“Centennial History of N.S.W.”
“We have been shown some excellent Testimonials of
the great cures performed by Herr Rassmussen, the Cele-
brated Danish Herbalist’s remedies.” — Australian Star.
“ Herr Rassmussen is too well and favourably known to
the Australian public to require any additional praise from
Truth. His Herbal Remedies are unequalled,”— Truth.
“Herr Rassmussen, we are glad to say, as a Medical
Herbalist, holds the highest place in the Colonies, and enjoys
the confidence of many of the leading people of N.S. Wales,
Victoria, and Queensland.”— Cooktown Courier (Q.).
“ It may not be out of place to mention that Herr
Rassmussen has now been established in the colonies for
nearly 10 years.”—Sydney Sunday Times,

established.” —S.A. Register, Adelaide.
“ Herr Rassmussen has achieved a high reputation for
his skill in botanical treatment of disease.” — Evening

(FOR THE BULLETIN.)
No. 11.
I entered the Tyson Sanatorium, Rand-
wick, Sydney, on 15th Dec,, 1892, with several
well-defined and justifiable impressions, born of
Manager Sterling’s conversation with me on the
previous Monday. These impressions may be
thus summarised: —l was to make myself
thoroughly at home and to ask for anything in
reason that I felt I wanted —alcoholic stimulants,
or beef-tea, or coffee, or tea—at any time of the
day; I was religiously to take “ the treatment ”
every hour, commencing at 8 o’clock a.rn. and
lasting until 8 p.m., or 13 doses each day, and it
was promised that I would soon acquire an abso-
lute “disgust against liquor,;’’ I would meet at
least one patient already practically cured by the
Tyson method ; Mr. Sterling would generally be
present to administer “ the treatmentbut, in
his absence, his assistant, Mr. Franklin,would be
on the premises, and in Franklin’s absence, “ the
matron ” would always be there and ready to
afford her services; that visiting physicians were
attached to the Sanatorium ; that the treatment
had been explained to and approved by Dr.
MacCarthy, of Sydney (whom I know personally);
and that I rather invited to take “liquor”
whenever I felt “so dispoged ” than expected to
fight shy of it.
As more or less of a chemist, I knew of a dozen
different means by which I could dispel existing
“jimjams,” but Sterling was confident that “The
Tyson Treatment ” would cure me permanently of
all desire for alcoholic beverages. That was a very
different result to anything I knew how to achieve.
I accepted this therapeutic challenge. I had a
disease; the Sanatorium people claimed to have a
cure for it. In three weeks I was to be turned
out as non-alcoholically inclined as I used to be in
the days of ray adolescence, before I took that
first drink of poison, which thousands of suc-
ceeding ones have failed to overtake. Alcohol
was to be chased out of my system in 21 times
13 rounds.
I underwent the test with the full sense of my
responsibility to readers of The Bulletin. It
was no easy task. On the one hand, I had to be
alert against self-deception; on the other, I
desired to give the Sanatorium every iota of
credit that was its just due. In the one balance
rested my own hopes and future prospects ; in the
other scale lay the possibilities to thousands who
might be influenced by my deliberately-recorded
opinions. The greatest danger of error, the wish
being father to the thought, lay in self-deception.
The cure must be absolute. The effort must be
made in complete obedience to the conditions pre-
scribed by my “enters.” Did they order me to
abstain from all intoxicants, I must comply. Did
they prefer that I should take whisky whenever I
felt inclined, it was my duty to drink it. The
results were not in the province of my own direc-
tion. I could merely watch and describe them.
That I personally disbelieved in taking alcohol
for the cure of alcoholic disease was not to the
point. The issue had to be decided by Tyson
views and Tyson conditions. I was entirely in
Tyson hands. As a matter of fact, I had passed
a whole day at home previously, in wretched but
heroic abstinence from grog.
Manager Sterling was away in the city when I
arrived at the Sanatorium—a fine, roomy house,
with over eight acres of picturesque grounds
attached. A lady asked me straight away if I
would “like anything an offer which I declined
nervously, being in a depressed mood from
alcoholic reaction. I was shown into an airy
upstairs room, having two windows opening out
upon two sides of a fine balcony, and containing
two comfortable single beds, one of which I at
once appropriated, the other remaining vacant
throughout my stay.
Upon one of the walls of my bedroom was
posted a printed notice - paper—“ Rules and
Regulations of the Tyson Sanatorium,” which
were ten in number. Of these I will trouble the
reader with only the following :
1. No Patient will be received for less than 21 days.
6. Patients must report themselves punctually at the
dispensing-room to receive their medicine at each hour
from 8 a.ra. till 8 p.m., inclusive, unless excused by the
physician in charge.
6. No Patient shall leave the premises without permis-
sion.
7. No intoxicating liquor shall be brought into the
Sanatorium by Patients or their friends. The physician
in charge will supply stimulants when necessary.
8. No articles of diet shall be brought into the Sana-
torium by Patients or Visitors.
No Patient shall smoke or use tobacco in any form for
the space of ten minutes before and after medicine.
Any Patient guilty of disobedience or non-compliance
with any of the above Rules and Regulations shall be
instantly expelled, and all moneys paid by him or on his
behalf shall be forfeited to the Institution ; nor shall any
Patient, having once been expelled, be permitted at any
future time to become an inmate of the Institution.
The Tyson Sanatorium Company,
H. FRANKLIN, Secretary.
Sydney.
I hereby agree to become an inmate of the Tyson Sana-
torium and to conform with the above Rules and Regula-
tions, and, in default, to forfeit all moneys paid by me.
Signed this day of 189 .
Witness,
I was not asked to sign any such document; but
I honestly complied with all its possible condi-
tions. There was no “physician in charge;”
neither was there any “visiting physician,”
though in answer to a direct question, days
Manager Sterling informed me that the doctor
already named was regarded as filling that office
in posse, but that the Sanatorium was not yet
fairly launched.
There was, I found, only one other patient in
the Sanatorium. On meeting him, I found that I
had enjoyed a slight acquaintance with him in
two other Australian capitals. He also was a
Test Patient, and may be itemised as No. 1, with
myself as No. 2. He had, he asserted, been pro-
minently connected with the wine-and- spirit
trade, and blamed drink for his social and busi-
ness downfall. He was enthusiastic over the
Tyson cure—days afterwards he declared that he
had never then meant the Tyson cure but a
mixture given him outside by Dr. MacCarthy—and
told me that he had been in the Sanatorium since
Saturday, December 3, and that he was a changed
man.
Manager Sterling arrived about 6 p.m. Accom-
panying him was a Sydney Echo reporter, who
stayed to dinner, and who subsequently “ wrote
up ” the institution. That he also was impressed
with No. I’s relation of his marvellous cure, and
that he, as I did, ascribed the cure to the “ Tyson
Treatment,” is abundantly evident from his'des-
criptive report.
As a matter of fact, up till December 15, No. 1
(on his subsequent admissions to myself and
others in my presence) had not taken one solitary
dose of the Tyson treatment until the same minute
that I took my first dose on the evening of
December 15. He had entered the Sanatorium,
per favour of a letter from Dr. MacCarthy, and
had taken a few doses of a mixture prescribed by
that medico.
I was not undeceived on this point until Dec.
19, and the Sydney press reports written between
those two dates, though some were not published
until after the 19th, show that the reporters were
similarly misled. Those reports contained abso-
lute untruths.
These misstatements were re-published as adver-
tisements in at least one Sydney newspaper, and
were quoted (possibly again as advertisements) in
a Melbourne evening paper.
To illustrate the audacity of some of the adver-
tised statements—advertised, by the way, as the
voluntary testimony of a reporter who “ dropped
in ” at Selborne, let me quote from a Sydney
Sunday paper article, bearing date Dec. 18, re-
specting No. 1 :
Now, after If days' treatment by the Tyson process, he
enjoys his meals, abhors all kinds of intoxicants, and
sleeps as soundly and as well as any person.
According to No. I’s later statements, by Dec.
18 he had only had two days’ experience of the
treatment, and not 14 days. No matter how
a reporter may have unwittingly erred, this
extract is from an advb.
The Australian Star (Sydney) of Dec. 19
blossomed out into a panegyric on the “Tyson
Cure.” The young-man reporter of that paper
had called at Selborne on the 16th, when No. 1 (as
well as myself) had only had 24 hours’ actual
experience of the “Tyson Treatment.” Iplenarily
excuse the Star visitor from misunderstanding the
unstinted praise of Tyson dealt out by No. 1.
Anyone listening to that individual’s gasconading
could form no other conclusion than that he had
experienced 12 days’ “ Tyson Treatment ” and had
become a new man. But whence the reporter
derived other scraps of information, it is not for
me to imagine :
The first ease under treatment, at Selborne ....
is being watched with a good deal of concern by a number
of medical men and others interested in the patient.
(Italics mine). Not a medical man ever visited
Selborne to my knowledge during my stay there :
He has now been undergoing the course for 13 dajs,
and a more complete change, &c.
He had “undergone the course” for one day
when the Star reporter visited us ; and for four
days, when the report appeared. Further on, the
same report refers more distinctly still to the
happy results achieved “ after 13 days’ treatment
by the Tyson process.”
In connection with the above, read the following
further extract from the same :
We have been given to understand that the managing-
director, Mr. Sterling, intends to shortly hold a public
meeting in the city for the purpose of introducing the
Tyson Cure to public notice, and on that occasion “ No.
1 Test Case ” will address the gathering. The gentleman
has done a good deal of public speaking, &c.
Yes, I know personally that he has a “ gift of the
gab ’’and is used to platform-speaking.
Now, all the Star’s precious tissue of misstate-
ments were reproduced in the Melbourne Stan-
dard. Accidentally ?
When, on December 19, I became aware of the
facts respecting No. I’s actual period of “ Tyson
Treatment,” when I remembered the preliminary
account of his admission and handling told me by
Sterling, when I recalled his own earnest assevera-
tions in witness of the good that the “ Tyson
Treatment” had effected in him (whereas he had
had no “Tyson Treatment” at all then), and when
I found that both Echo and Star reporters had
accepted and interpreted his statements as I
myself had accepted them and interpreted them—
what could I think ?
What I did think need not be stated. Sufficient
for test purposes should be my own personal
experience.
What is the “ Tyson Treatment ?” The
“dispensing-room ” at Selborne is anywhere.
The whole Tyson dispensary may be carried in
one’s hat. It consists of two small bottles—
probably 3oz. and l|oz.—labelled, as the first
test patients are styled, “No. 1 ” and “No. 2” —
and a glass-CMm-guttapereha “ dropper ” for mea-
suring “minims” or “drops.” The dose is—six
drops of No. 1, with three drops of No. 2, in
water, every hour—or 13 times a day. No. lis a
dark amber in colour ; No. 2 is greenish in tinge.
No. 1 is acrid in taste; No. 2is bitter. The
blend is of a quinine-like, or, more correctly,
strychnia-like bitterness to the palate. Mixed
together, a sediment is precipitated, so that the
two mixtures are “ incompatibles ” from a dis-
penser’s stand-point. This is evidently why two
separate bottles are required.
Upon water being added, the greasy-looking
drops cause that liquid to turn milky. This, to a
chemist, at onco indicates that both No. 1 and
No. 2 are alcoholic tinctures—it may be of essen-
tial oils that are insoluble in water, I have not
made the experiment, for the “treatment”
was not mine to play with; but I would wager
that, if tested, both No. 1 and No. 2, unwatered,
would take flame and burn to extinction of the
last drop. They present the aspect of tinctures
made with rectified spirits.
This at once suggests the debatable question—
Can strongly-alcoholic tinctures, even diluted
diffusely with water, be expected to drive all
alcohol completely out of the system ?
Otherwise Dr. Tyson’s treatment is intelligible
enough, and seemingly rational. His idea, to my
glimmering, appears to be this:—(l) To adminis-
ter, .at one and the same time, a sedative and
tonic—the combination also acting as a deobstru-
ent ; (2) to administer this remedy in one continu-
ous stream, like the drip from a curtain kept web
by capillary attraction, so that a combined effect
of uniform strength is always present.
In an ordinary 13-dose day, a patient absorbs
78 drops of No. 1 and 39 drops of No. 2 ; or 1 3-10th
“medical ” teaspoonfuls of the first and half that
quantity of the second—or, roughly, about an
average domestic teaspoonful and half-teaspoonful
respectively. Instead of exhibiting this in one
dose, which might or might not be hurtful, the
quantity is spread over the whole day.
I swallowed my first dose of the “ Tyson Treat-
ment ” before dinner on Thursday evening, Dec.
15, ’92, and my last on Thursday morning, Jan. 5,
’93. On my first evening I drank three Tysons,
three whiskies, and a sleeping-draught. Friday
saw me shaking down well to the routine—l 4
Tysons and three whiskies. Saturday I let pass
without alcohol; but made up for it by taking five
whiskies on Sunday, in honour of some Melbourne
Sanatorium visitors, among whom was the secre-
tary of the Melbourne Sanatorium, of whom more
anon.
So passed the days. The “Tyson Treatment”
was taken with unfailing regularity. Whisky
was generally accepted when proffered, and once
at lunch I had a glass of stout. There were indi-
gestion, flatulence, and diarrhoea, a bad cold,
neuralgia, headaches, listlessness,, drum-pulsa-
tions in the ears, with - dd spells of breezy cheer-
fulness of feeling; ' ut . fortnight elapsed and
whisky was not distasteful to the palate ; indeed,
at times of lowness of spirits, it was sinfully grate-
ful to the stomach.
To paraphrase a sentence in the special report
already quoted :
This new familiar 1 had taken to myself certainly did
tolerate and welcome alcohol in the form of whisky.

To Messrs. Bosisto and Co., —
lb is with pleasure that I write to _ state
my opinion of your Eucalyptus Oil. It is de-
cidedly better than any other similar oil which
can be obtained in this country.
It is a lighter, clearer and more ethereal oil
than any I have hitherto used, besides being free
from the heavy, nauseous odour oharaJteristio of
others.
This is particularly noticeable when the oil is
sprayed into the throat.
It is very palatable when taken internally,
which places it above other preparations and con-
siderably enhances its value.

I may mention that, ordinarily, there was no
official dispenser.
Mr. Sterling went to the city every business
day, and “Mr. Franklin” was never visible to
my sight.. Neither have I come across anybody
who has met him. A pressman told me with an
air of confidential patronage that Sterling and
Franklin were one and the same individual. If
that be so, I had cause again to resent a deception
practised upon me in preliminary conversation.
These incidents sharpened my roused suspicions,
and I was at once struck with the assonant coinci-
dence that Sterling’s name is “Frank,” which he
is commonly called by his friends, and the secre-
tary’s name is Franklin.
On Christmas day, I drank one whisky, but,
noticing an apparent stiffness in the rela-
tions between host and patient, I resolved to go
without until the Thursday following, and then
to see whether liquor would be repulsive. And I
may mention that, during Christmas and Boxing
days, Mr. Sterling being at home all day, he (as
he afterwards informed me) doubled my Tysons
to 12 drops of No. 1, and 6 drops of No. 2 at each
dose. Nevertheless, on the Thursday evening, I
felt comforted internally when I took three doses
of whisky.
From that date, 29th Dec., I determined to
finish my term without the aid of any alcoholic
stimulant whatever, in order to see whether total
abstinence, in conjunction with the Tyson treat-
ment, would produce better results.
I had no whisky therefrom. This change of
programme was chiefly due to the morally suasive
fact that both The Bulletin and Manager
Sterling began to think that I was treating the
test too lightly, that I drank whisky from
bravado, and that I looked upon the Sanatorium
as a huge joke.
Nothing could be more unjust to me. I will
admit that the deceptions I have mentioned had
their weight in influencing the trend of my mental
examinings, If such statements as those that
appeared in the Sydney press, to be reprinted in
the Melbourne press, were so slightly connected
with the truth, what (I could not help asking
myself) was the value of the sheaves of rattling
testimonials of which the Sanatorium proudly
boasted ? Were all its alleged feats founded on
such flimsy basis of verity? Then the unre-
strictedly generous hospitality of Mr. Sterling,
the fact that I personally liked him, and was daily
breaking bread and eating salt in his close com-
panionship, and yet was in duty bound to treasure
up, note, and weigh these blemishes, made my
residence at Selborne unhappy and my duty
doubly difficult. A letter in a Sydney evening
paper, signed by Dr. MacOarthy, contained
sufficient inherent proof that he was not “ visiting
physician ” to Selborne ; yet I had been assured
that he was.
Amongst other stretchers, Sydney Truth
asserted (Dec. 18): —
The clergy of the several denominations have paid
extended visits to Selborne.
No clergyman ever presented himself inside the
grounds while I was there! Yet this statement
was contained in a descriptive report inserted as
an ad vertisement. Clearly, then, the public were
being fooled, and on me had been cast the onus of
unfooling them. This disagreeable worry may
have acted injuriously on my health. At any
rate, I know I was mopish every time I con-
trasted my friendship’s urgings with facts. Then,
if Sterling were Franklin and Test Patient No. 1
were—but this line of tangle is profitless.
My last week at the Sanatorium was, as I have
said, grogless; and, additionally, the doses of
“Tyson” from Friday, 30th Deo. until 12 noon
on Monday, 2nd Jan., were once more of double
strength—l 2 drops of No. 1, and 6 drops of No. 2
per hour. On the 12th, owing to rather unhealthy
symptoms and a glaring loss of appetite, the doses
were reduced to 6 and 3 as before. Mr. Sterling
assured me that there had never been a previous
instance of a patient needing a “ double dose ” for
more than one day, I, it will be seen, had two
days of it at one stretch, and three days at
another. With no results but unpleasant ones.
When I left the Sanatorium on January 5 I did
nob, my friends assert, present a healthy or
vigorous or built-up appearance. Also, 1 felt
fagged. For two or three days afterwards I did
little but sleep, or rather, drowse feverishly, and
I was unable to do any work until late on the
Sunday night. The array of testimonials from
others as to the efficacy of the “ Tyson Cure ” is,
to my experience, a mockery. Still, if any con-
solation can be extracted from the admission, I
will state that, on leaving the Sanatorium, I had
no desire whatever to plunge at once into a public-
house and fill myself up with snake-juice. Still
less had I any inclination for voluntary “Tysons.”
(I have not been an absolute teetotaller since.)
I find from my diary notes that, during my
term, I imbibed 25 glasses of whisky and one
glass of stout; and swallowed nearly seven fluid
ozs, of “Tyson’s Treatment” in about as many
pints of water.

The Secretary of the Melbourne Sana-
torium favoured Selborne with a two days’ visit,
December 17 —19. He is a remarkably cool,
shrewd-looking man-of-the-world, soft-voiced and
silky-mannered an easy-going, good - looking,
blonde.
He gave me an account of how he went over to
the U.S. in search of a “ Cure for Drunkenness ; ”
how he first of all visited the Keely Institute with
an idea of driving a bargain with the Keely Co.
in respect of the Australian right of the Double-
Chloride of Gold or Keely Cure ; how he was dis-
satisfied with the results visible in the Keely In-
stitute, with gruesome touches concerning the
poisonous-looking scabs on the arms of the hypo-
dermically-syringed victims, and whispers of fairy-
tales anent inoculated insanity ; how ho heard
Keely say that the only rival he feared was “ a
fellow down in Ohio ; ” how he therefore went to
Ohio, on a purely prospecting search, and lighted
on “Dr. Luther B. Tysop ” at once; how he in-
vestigated for months the results of Tyson’s
treatment and became convinced that at last he
had got hold of a genuine cure for dipsomania,
and that, with a heart swelling to benefit the poor
slaves to drink, he had come to terms with the
Delivering Genius of the Age. His story of how
that Genius discovered the secret is in itself a
sentimental romance.
“ Will 20,000 dollars buy your recipe, Dr.
Tyson ? ”
“‘No, sirree; nor 50,000; nor any sum. The
secret is known to me alone, and shall be revealed
to my son in good time.’ And the consequence
is that Dr. Tyson is now making a big fortune a
week. Yes, a big fortune a week.”
But the shrewd blonde did not say what the
Victorian syndicate was making.
The Melbourne “ secretary ” is good company.
There are, however, a few conundrums connected
with him. He signs his name officially as “H. E. 1
Peate.” He was introduced to me as “ Mr. Peate,
our Melbourne manager,” by Mr. Sterling. I
heard Sterling afterwards familiarly address him
as “Sam.” Later on, he was trippingly alluded
to in his absence as “Mr. Freshman,” and a Mel-
bourne acquaintance of mine has known him for
years as “Samuel Freshman,”
These little matters may be explained as mere
justifiable commercial conveniences, but, in that
case, the Tyson Sanatorium Co. of Victoria has no
call to paint itself as anything higher than a quack-
medioine-vending, money-making venture, in
common with lots of other much-puffed “ benefits
to the human race.”
* * *
The curse of alcoholism is such a world-
shadowing, mankind-blasting plague that were a
really effective “cure,” or even a meritorious pre-
ventive, discovered and puffed by the arch-cham-
pion of charlatans himself, The Bulletin would
do a good act if it gave it free advertising space.
So much panoramic mirage of reality had been
given to the alleged cures by the “Tyson Treat-
ment ’’that the best results were hoped for, even
in the case of a stringent and thoroughly searching
test. The chief outcome is regret that the “Tyson
Treatment ” is not what its vendors proclaim it to
be. It does not invariably remove the desire for
intoxicants of all kinds, and it is debateable
whether it is “perfectly harmless, morally, men-
tally, and physically,” as its proprietors assert.
Therapeutically, a great deal too much emphasis
is placed upon the direct action of the Tyson
drugs, and far too little to the patient’s physique,
to the beneficial effects of regular habits, strict
regimen, wholesome and generous diet, enforced
cleanliness, cheerful surroundings, absence of busi-
ness worries and sufficient sleep. These consti-
tute in themselves means capable of completing
a physical reformation in many patients;
Estimating the recuperative value of my own
stay in the Randwick Sanatorium, I give it as
my unhesitating opinion that, had I been clapped
by authority into an ordinary gaol for three
weeks, had I been compelled to eat the rough but
wholesome gaol diet and conform to the sanitary
discipline of that establishment, I would, without
the internal exhibition of a single drug, have
emerged from “chokee” a healthier, sounder and
more recuperated man than I was when I left
Selborne.
Would I have taken a drink immediately after
leaving gaol ? Almost without a doubt. That is
quite another question. I should most probably
have immediately poured out libations in com-
memoration of my regained freedom. That is a
matter of choice, and, so far as the Sanatorium’s
lingering influence over me is concerned, I have
no inward feeling of repulsion against the exercise
of that choice.
Gaol is undoubtedly the recuperator of the
half-starved, alcoholised criminal. One observes
its patrons enter lean and gaunt, with hollow
cheeks and sunken eyes, with limpness of gait and
boniness of contour. They are washed, clipped,
shaved, hustled about, provided with regular
though coarse meals, compelled to regular hours,
disciplined in physical exertion, and are turned
out fat, rosy, clear-eyed and staunch of gait.
Only, they have no worldly incentive of sufficient
attraction to cause them to continue over them-
selves the same discipline which they were com-
pelled to observe in prison, So the dogs return to
their vomit.
* * *
My recent experiment has confirmed me
in a long-held opinion that no so-called drink-cure
can be efficacious in the absence of will-power on
the part of the patient. In other words, each
advertised remedy is merely an aid and support
to the will. Which leads to a further considera-
tion.
No lost will-power can be restored to a patient,
unless he or she has an absolute preliminary faith
in the.efficacy of the remedy experimented with.
Here, then, are opened up all the questions
embraced by the Faith Cure, of which the Echo
Farm, at Middle Harbour, is only one of many
illustrations. Faith in healing can work apparent
miracles. Once, when I was a young assistant to
a chemist, I was suddenly confronted, during the
absence of my employer, by a cabman who thought
he was going to die. He was in a bad way,
evidently from heat-apoplexy. With the “front”
of youth, I gave him—simply, 15 drops of
“diluted sulphuric acid” in a wineglassful of
water, coloured with a few drops of “ burnt
sugar.” But the wise way in which I looked at
his tongue, felt his pulse, cross-examined him as
to his symptoms, and finally told him impressively
that the wonderful draught I was about to
administer would make him “a new man in
20 minutes ’’—did the whole trick. He did re-
cover completely within 20 minutes, and would
never again let my employer serve him if I was in
the shop.
Any doctor could reel you off scores of true
anecdotes to similar purpose. With the Faith
Cure, a few drops of pure water have frequently
been hypodermically injected by a Melbourne
doctor into the arms of dipsomaniacs, who
would be told that all desire for grog would now
cease until the clock struck such an hour, when
they must be “here to the tick ” to have the in-
jection repeated. This remedy never failed with
suitable “ faith ” subjects. It is doubtless allied
to hypnotism and cures “by suggestion.”
Its converse is death by “fright,” many
authentic eases of which are extant, as,
for instance, that of the Parisian condemned
criminal who was spared the guillotine and
handed over to members of the Faculty.
These blindfolded him and punctured his arm,
telling him they had inoculated him with
cholera germs. He not only developed cholera
but he died of it. Yet he had only been pricked
with a clean needle-point, and not a hypodermic
syringe at all. Imagination and Will hold strong
sway over the physical human envelope.
# # *
W 1 lore Faith is not, and where, therefore,
a surrendered Will is not, there is nothing in the
world can cure the dipsomaniac but compulsion.
Immure him safely against the possible reach of
all liquors until iiis lit has passed—no matter
whether it be for days or weeks. Keep him abso-
lutely touch-proof from it; he will thank you
afterwards That is the sum of my experience.
[We are very sorry to say that the writer of the
foregoing has, since leaving the Tyson Institute,
relapsed into liquor, giving very strong evidence
that the treatment doesn’t cure everyone. Ed. B.]

Here at Last!
Some seven years ago a strange thing happened to the lady
whose photo, appears herewith, whereby she became
A. MYSTERY
Which no one can explain or account for so far, not even her
husband. How it happened was this ; She lay dying of a compli-
cation of diseases ; often she would faint off, and lie unconscious
as long as 30 hours at a stretch—frigid as a corpse and apparently
dead. The leading medical men of Melbourne were in attendance,
often at a cost of Five, Guineas a day, yet she sank lower and
lower. Everything that medical science could suggest was tried ;
even morphia failed to give enough ease for two hours’ sleep
daily. At last, in desperation, some said, “ Try Mesmerism.”
Mr. Harle, as a Mesmerist,
Had been very successful on the public platform, and had also
saved life by private magnetic treatment; but Mrs. Harle, being
a lady of very pronounced opinions and strong mind of her own,
never could see anything in it but a hobby of his, and so, when
urged to try it, she ridiculed the very idea ; but they said, “ Try
it far steep only you will go mad for want of rest.” For a long
lime she could not bring her mind to submit; at last, after much
prayer to God for guidance and help, she was willing to try.
After about half an hour’s mesmeric influence and passes, she
went ff into a peaceful hypnotic state, which lasted, as was
iniemhd, from eight at night till ten next morning; and she
awoke rested and refreshed. The experiment was repealed, when
Lo! Everyone was Startled
Mrs. J. N. HARLE.
To find that, whilst to all intents and purposes she was asleep, yet in another sense, the mind was far more awake,
and she commenced talking about what the servant was doing on the ground floor, what an acquaintance was doing a
mile away, Vvhat was happening in the home of a dear friend some few blocks away, and so forth, then she was
requested Id look into her own body ; this she did, and was surprised herself, and surprised everyone else, by tracing
the cause of hei* trouble, which proved to be mainly an internal cancer. She then told them how to cure her.
Crowds of Friends Came to See Her*
For she had a large and influential circle of acquaintances. She astounded all by her marvellous pow ers of vision
to see into their bodies as if they were made of transparent glass, to see the members of their families, to know all
about their commercial affairs, seemed quite easy to her ; England; America, New Zealand, etc.; seemed just like next
door.
The Sensation was Immense!
Drawing-room, Sitting-room, Dining-room and Bedroom were crowded with inquisitive people, and the invalid became
ji phenomenon. The doctors were nonplussed with their patient - she gave directions how to Soften the cancer to the
lancing state: this \Vas dohe ; th'en, as they dare not glVe. chloroforth on account of her heart, Mr. Harle put hei undei
mesmerism, whilst Drs. Tfeaghe, of Collins Street, lanced it. She awoke withbut having felt anything that had imp*
pened. Everyone said : “Start find Use yoiir powers tor doing good, you can
Save Lives by Thousands.”
But her health was too low. First, she cured herself-in three months’lime she was again taking her accustomed
drives on the Esplanade, in her phaeton, to the astonishment of the whole district. in properly tone tiie system a
change of climate was needed, and she came to N.S. Wales. For a short time she resided in Maitland ; her retreat
was known by those who were aware of her powers, and she got no peace till she agreed to start practice. File years
ago Mrs. Harle opened in Newcastle ; three years out of the five have been spent travelling in the Northern district,
and away in the bush discovering gold mines, and she seems to be able to find gold as easy as trace disease.
Seven Thousand People Have Consulted Her
In her mesmeric state ; some about business, but most about their health. Not one ban say :“I am worse for yoiir
treatment,” whilst all who have follow el the advice and treatment, rejoice in rcstoi-ed health; Mrs. Harle describes
each diseased organ, finds the cause of every Iron hie; and prescribes remedies and treatment. Her wonderful mental
vision or clear sight enables hei - to see just what medicine, and how long it will take to cure it; often giving the
medicinh three mhnths ahead, and never changing a bottle.
Warning! •„
If you wish to mortally offend Mrs. Harle, just class her along with the card-reading, palm-scanning, fortune-telling
crowd, and the task is'done. No such rubbish ! Mrs. Harle is mesmerised by her husband, and when in the hypnotic
state, she sees with her mind. She cannot open her eyes, yet she hears, talks, asks and answers questidriS, etc. When
the mesmerism is undone, she awakes, and knows no more of what has happened; thaii if she had been Chloroformed
or dead.
It Causes a Terrible Mental Strain;
Therefore, Mr. Harle reserves the right to say when she has done enough, and may refuse any hr all fit such tinies.

In view of a certain coming event the
English newspapers are busily working up bogus
anecdotage re Princess “ May ”of Teck. London
D.T. sets forth that the other day, whilst out
driving, she saw a costermonger brutally “ per-
suading ” Ids donkey. Pulling up her ponies, she
ordered her groom to take the whip from the man,
who naturally resented this summary proceeding.
A card was promptly handed to him (though a
coster he could read 1) whereupon he fell on his
knees in the dust, “ begged ’er R’yal ’ighnesses’
parding,” and broke his whip over his knees, not
necessarily for publication, bijt as a guarantee of
good faith, vowing that thenceforth ho would
treat his “ neddy ” as a brother. Through his
eontrite tears he could just see a tiny hand
extended, and holding out his own in response
found himself the happy possessor of a real golden
sovereign ; and ere he could dry his eyes the
Princess was far on the road towards home. This
is the sort of stuff with which the “largest cir-
culation” works up the diminishing loyalty of its
readers. Part of the story may be swallowed, but
the sovereign business is a bit too thick. Coins
of that denomination are not too abundant with
the poor Ticks.

and refused all preferment save the esteem of those
who knew him, which meant everybody, young and
old. He and a party of four came from Plymouth
to Australia in the fifties in a small craft. Settling
in Bendigo he worked 40 years in the mines, and
as a miner met his doom. He was trucking
mullock away from one of the upper levels of the
Catherine Reef shaft, and at his age, 02, it re-
quired all his strength to push the loaded truck to
the cage ; therefore, he put his head down and
pushed with all his might, thinking the cage was
at the shaft to receive it. A few moments before
one of the bosses had, without warning, signalled
the empty cage away. Ellis’ own son-in-law, the
engine-driver, obeyed the signal, and ere the cage
reached the surface poor Ellis had pushed the
truck into the shaft and was carried down with it
300 feet. Little wonder, under the circumstances,
that the company awarded his widow .£4OO.
Three generations wept at his grave, and
grief was felt by many miners scattered over the
gold-fields of Australia when they heard the sad
ending of an old and beloved comrade.

"Bully” Hayes : The Pirate of the
Pacific.
A CHAPTER OF SOUTH SEA HISTORY.
(FOR THE BULLETIN.)
“ Bully ” Hayes ! O, halcyon days of 70
and ’74, when the Pacific was riot, as now; patrolled
by men-of-war from lonely Pylstaart, in the
Friendlies, to the low-lying, far-away Marshalls
and the coral lagoons of the North-West; when the
Queensland schooners ran full nigger cargoes to
Bundaberg, Maryborough, and Port Maokay;
when the Government Agents, drunk nine days
out of ten (as they probably will be now),
did as much recruiting as the recruiters them-
selves, arid drew (even as they may draw to-
day) thumping bonuses from the planters sub
rosei. In those days the Hawaiian nigger-
catching fleet of Spreckels cruised right away
south to palm-clad Arorai, in the Line Islands,
rind ran the Queensland ships close in the busi-
riess. They came down froiri Honolulu in ballast-
trim, save for the liquor and firearms, and went
Hack full of a sweating niass of black-haired,
coppet-coloured Lirie Islanders, driven below at
dark, to take their chance of being smothered if it
crime on to blow. Better for them had
it so happened, as befel the Tahiti a few
moriths ago, when 400 souls sank on their
way to slavery iri San Jose de Guatemala.
Merry times, indeed, had we then in the trade
“absolutely above reproach” when Queensland
rivalled the Hawaiian Islands in the exciting
business! of nigger-catching, and when Captairi
William Heriry Hayes, of Cleveland, Ohio,
U.S.A., vulgarly called “Bully” Hayes, came
twice a year to Samoa with full cargoes of oil,
copra; and niggers, all obtained on the captain’s
peculiar time-payment system.
• • •
A few weeks ago I met an old shipmaster
coming out of Sydney Exchange. We fell to
talking of bygone days when we were both in
“ the trade,” he a past-master in the art of black-
biiding, and I but a callow recruit, or rather
recruiter, having plenty of enthusiasm and a con-
science sufficiently elastic for the peculiarities of
the business “absolutely above reproach.” Pre-
sently the old fellow —who, by the way, was a
Scotchman and accustomed to speak of the trade
as a “ varraineequeetous business,” said, with a
sigh, as he putdown his “gless”—“ Weel, Weel, it’s
nae use talkin’, there was wheeps o’ money in it
and noo that Saum Greefiths has gone on the ither
tack (the man hasna’ the guts of a shairk) I’m
thinkin’ we’ll have another chance o’ grabbing
niggers’ wool again, and it’s no so unlikely that
‘ , o’ the Hopeful ’ ” (referring to a well-known
Australian politician at one time Samuel W. Grif-
fith’s bete noir) “ willna’ hae the pluck to show his
colours, too, and send oot anither Hopeful. D’ye
mind, noo, that there was nasae lucky a raon at it
a’ than that deevil’s pup of a Bully Hayes, as ye
know weel.”
One hardly ever hears the name of the redoubt-
able Bully mentioned nowadays ; yet it is not so
many years ago since his name was a power all
over the wide Pacific from Manilla to Valparaiso.
In those days did a German trading : vessel in the
islands sight a white-painted brig with yacht-like
lines and carrying Cunningham’s patent top’sails
the Teutonic skipper cracked on all his ship could
stagger under and thanked Gott when he saw the
stranger hull-down ; for Bully, with his jidus
achates , the almost equally notorious Captain Ben
Peese, had a penchant for boarding Dutchmen and
asking for a look at their chronometers, and iri his
absent-minded way taking these latter away with
him.
And iri Sydney, too, many of the pompous;
pauncheous, grey - headed, 1-am-a-Broken-Hill-
shareholder-sir city men will remember the gay,
dashing, black-whiskered Yankee captain who, iri
the “ sixties,” came to Melbourne in a flash clipper
ship and paid also a long visit to Port Jackson,
where he spent his money royally, flirting (alas !
if he had but stopped at that) with every acces-
sible woman of high or low degree—provided she
was fair to look upon—and playing the devil
generally in every known and unknown manner;
and who then sailed gaily away to China, neglect-
ing to attend to many little financial matters in
connection with the refitting of his ship, and
leaving the affections of a number of disconsolate
beauties in a very bad state of repair.
1 knew Bully Hayes well, for I sailed with and
was wrecked with him in his famous brig, and,
after the conversation just alluded to, the memory
of those wild days comes strongly upon me. I am
not going to risk damnation of soiil by spinning a
faricifully-embroidered tale about things that did
riot happen, and wrong the memory of the defunct
pirate (whose bones lie at the bottom of the North-
west Pacific, unless, indeed, as is most likely, they
were long ago digested by the blue sharks), by
even alluding to the murders, iribst foul and un-
natriral, credited td him by his enemies. Many
of these tales are purely missionaries’ babble arid
slander the nidus formed in Micronesia, and
spread by villainous riewspaper reports all over
the United States. I will relate what I did see
and what did occur.
* # *
A man’s true character is always revealed
by sudden misfortune. I was with Hayes when,
perhaps, the heaviest Stroke of ill-luck he ever
experienced befell him. In March of ’74, the lily-
white brig Leonora ground herself to death on the
jagged coral of Strong’s Island, in the Caroline
Group, and Bully seemed for the nonce a broken
man. But I did not sd well know then that
beneath that gay, laughirig, devil-may-care
exterior there lay a whole world of dauntless
courage and iron resolution 5 that six months
after the brig was destroyed he would, by
unwearying toil and the wonderful fascination he
exercised over his fierce and ruffianly creW, find
himself a wealthier man than when he trod his
brig’s deck with a full cargo of oil beneath his
feet and ten thousand dollars in his cabin.
# # *
Let me first of all, though, speak of the
Leonora, once the Waterlily, and alias the Luna,
the Lebnie, and the Racinga. As the Waterlily
she was first known, and under that name did her
maiden voyage in the opium-trade and beat the
record. At this time Hayes made his appearance
at one of the Treaty Ports in a ship named the
Old Dominion. On the way out from New York
his crew had mutinied, headed by the steward, a
Greek. In the fight that ensued Hayes killed one
man outright by a blow of his fist, and threw
another with such violence that he died in a few
hours. An inquiry was held, and Hayes came
out of it well. The Old Dominion was sold, and
Hayes entered the Imperial Chinese service as
commander of a gunboat. Another gunboat was
commanded by one Ben Peese. The two became
friends, and in conjunction with some mandarins
of high tank, levied a system of blackmail upon
the Chinese coasting junks that brought them (not
the junks) iri money very rapidly, and Hayes’
daring attack on and capture of, a nest of (other)
pirates procured for him a good standing with the
Chinese authorities. Peese soon got into trouble,
however, and when a number of merchants, who
had been despoiled, had succeeded in proving that
his gunboat was a worse terror to them than the
pirates whom he worried, he disappeared for a
time. The Waterlily, instead of sailing for Cal-
cutta, was chartered at a big figure by some rich
merchants to take a cargo to Rangoon. Shortly
after her departure, Hayes resigned and went to
Macao. Here he was joined by his colleague, in
commandof the Waterlily. How Peese had got pos-
session of her was not known. Hayes told people
that his friend had bought her, but those intimate
with Peese knew a great deal better. Anyhow,
the merchants who chartered her said that Peese
had pirated her, landed them somewhere in the
Straits, taken all their dollars, sold the cargo to
the Dutch military authorities, and cleared out.
And then with a new ship, a new crew (many of
whom were Hayes’ arid Peese’s former Chinese
naval pirates), the partners sailed for the Bonin
Islands, where Peese was well-known and had
lived before, Two days ere making the Bonins a
ship was sighted ashore bn a reef. It Was a gun-
boat froiri Macao with an official on board bound
id the Boriin Islands to investigate the murder of
a Portuguese captairi and mate. A boat was
lowered frdm ihe Waterlily, and Peese, who spoke
Spanish well, learned from the captain that the
gunboat, which was then hard and fast, had run
ashore iri the night and.bumped a big hole in her-
self just amidships. Peese agreed for a thousand
dollars to stand by them and save all he could, in-
cluding her four guns. The guns were rafted to
the Waterlily, then the small arms and stores
followed in the boats belonging to the gunboat.
At dusk Hayes went aboard and took the brig’s
Chinese carpenter with him. On examination he
Said the ship could be got off again if she could be
canted over and a sail put over the hole. This
the gunboat captain agreed to try, and signalled
for his boats to return from the Waterlily. After
working all night the thing was done, and the
captain and officers were profuse in their expres-
sions of admiration of Hayes’s skill. As the
tide fell the carpenters got to work, and
the gunboat was made water-tight. Under Hayes’s
direction, at flood-tide, she was then hedged over
the reef into the lagoon, and anchored in smooth
water. Peese and Hayes then arranged to sail in
the brig (at next tide), lay her alongside, and put
the guns and stores aboard again, agreeing to take
the captain’s order for 700dols. and SOOdols. in
cash. But next morning the brig was nowhere to
be seen, and although the captain had his ship, he
Was minus his big guns, small arms, stores to the
value of 2000 or 3000 dollars, and his passenger,
the Corregidor, In attempting to get under
weigh he again ran ashore, and remained hard and
fast for a week. Meanwhile, Hayes and Peese
had gone off on a southerly course to the Pelew
Group (the Corregidor was put on board a German
barque met on the way), where the cannons were
sold to the chiefs, and the two captains gave a
great feast, and got rid of nearly all their crew,
taking Pelew men and seven Japanese in their
places. Here Hayes and Peese fell out—over a
woman, of course. teese , ■ bought a very
beautiful girl from one of the chiefs for AiOdols.,
which, he told Hayes privately, he did not intend
to pay. - Hayes, for reasons of lus own, insisted
on his either paying the sum agreed on or giving
her up. Peese, declaring he .would do as he liked,
drew his pistol arid ordered the girl into the boat,
Hayes tore the weapon from him, and seizing the
girl with one hand pointed the pistol at Peese and
told him to go on board. Peese was no co ward,
but he knew his man, and sulkily retired. With
all Hayes s wickedness he was not entirely heart-
less. He asked the girl to tell him if she was
afraid of Peese. She said No. and then Bully
quietly told her to follow his fellow-captain
aboard. But Peese never forgave him, and from
that day the pair were full of mutual distrust.
After cruising about the Western Carolines for
two or three months, and in some mysterious way
filling up the brig with a cargo of cocoanut oil,
and getting half a ton of hawk-bill turtle-shell,
worth (idols, a pound, the two worthies appeared
in Apia Harbour, Samoa. Here they sold the
cargo and obtained a commission from the firm of
Johann Caesar Godeffroy and Sons, of Hamburg
—a firm that in Polynesia rivalled, m a small
way, John Company to procure for them 200 or
300 Line Island labourers at lOOdols. per head. _
In those days the most respected storekeeper in
Apia was a retired mariner a Captain iurnbull
—a stout old man, slow of speech, and profoundly,
but not obtrusively, religious. People used to
wonder how it was that MisiPulu, the shrewdest
brisiness-man ill thegrbup, would supply Hayes With
a thousand or two thousand dollars worth or trade,
and merely take his I O 17; while refusing tb
give credit to any other soul. Spoken to on the
(flatter, the gruff old man replied, That s tny
business, but 111 tell you why I trust a Irian
like Hayes and won’t trust anyone here, i know
the man, and I’ve told him what none of you
would dare to tell him, that I looked upon his
course pi life with horror. He laughed at me
and said with a dreadful oath that if ever he
could do me a ‘good turn he would. I hat
pleased me, and When he came to me a week after-
wards and said that he wanted new canvas and
running-gear, but the Dutchmen woc *u t Sell
him any on credit, I said I would—and did, and
he paid me, and I 11 give him a few thousand
dollars credit any day.”
Bully and Peese sailed for the Ellice and
Gilbert groups, and soon news reached bydney
that they had been playing havoo with the traders
there. With the traders of Captain Eury, and
those of Captain Daly, of the brig Lady Alicia,
they were very rough, appropriating all their oil
and other native produce and giving them sarcas-
tically-written receipts. Hayes stated that this
was in retaliation for Daly haying visited his
stations in some of the Kingsmills, and having
been too friendly with some of the local fair,
When the brig returned to Samoa Hayes alone
was in command ; the voluble, bearded Peese had,
he said, sold him his interest in the ship and gone
to China again. People talked and said that
Hayes had killed him, but as the strength of the
big captain’s right arm was well known m
Samoa nobody talked too loud. It was on
this occasion that Hayes “ had ’ the Gorman firm
for some thousands of dollars. It seems that in
returning through the Kingsmill and Gilbert
groups he found a number of the German firm s
traders in terror of their lives, the natives having

warned them to clear out or be killed. Hayes
consented to give them all passages to Samoa
for a consideration, of course, and they agreed on
behalf of their linn to pay him each SOdols.
passage-money, a reasonable enough sum. Most
of them had large quantities of oil and copra—this
also was shipped. After the last island had been
visited Hayes called them together in the cabin
and addressed them “ Now, boys, I’ve promised
to give you all passages to Samoa, and 1 will—if
you do what i want. Now, you’ve all got money
belonging to the German firm. Well, each of you
must give me SOdols., and if you take my advice
you’ll stick to the remainder. One thing you all
know as well as 1 do, and that is, that the Hutch-
men will take your souls out of their cases if you
owe them anything. As for the oil and copra I'll
see to that. That’s ail I’ve got to say, and if any
of you won’t agree to this let him come on deck
and try and convince me.” The traders grinned
and consented to take the offer of a passage and
the privilege of annexing the firm’s dollars, and
each paid his SOdols. When Hayes got to Samoa,
Weber, the German manager, interviewed Bully,
who detailed the dangers the traders had escaped,
and genially said : “ I hardly like to makh you
pay for your traders’ passages, but as I have such
a heavy cargo for you, you won’t object to pay me
a trifle—say SOdols. each. They’ve all got money
for yoii as well as oil and copra.” Weber paid,
Hayes giving an acknowledgment. Then Weber
sent his cargo-boats to unload the brig. He was
rather surprised when Hayes sent him a note ;
Bng Leonora, Apia. Dear Sir. You have forgotten
that you have not yet made any arrangements with me
about the freight of your oil and’copra. Freight on
200 OOOlbs. copra, at 1 cent per lb., 2000d015., for the oil a
lump sura of 500dols. ; in all 2500d015. Unless the freight is
paid at once, and delivery taken forthwith, I will proceed
to New Zealand, and sell to recoup mysd’. - W. H. Hayes.
The Germans nearly went mad, but knowing
what Hayes was and fearing to lose everything,
they paid and took delivery, and Hayes, as he
paid over, told Weber that he would always have
a good opinion of him in future for his prompt
manner in settling up. Weber gasped, but said
nothing. . ,
Just about this time the U.S.S. Narrangansett
steamed into Apia harbour. It had been rumoured
around Polynesia for some time previously that
certain charges had been made against Bully by
American citizens. What the exact nature of
these charges were has never been known. Any-
how, the captain of the corvette heard that Hayes
was at anchor in Apia, and came down full speed
from Pago Pago in Tutuila. Captain Ed. Hamil-
ton (who died only last year) was then pilot, and
brought the Narrangansett in. The moment the
anchor was down, an armed boat’s crew dashed
aboard the Leonora and took possession. The
officer in command had a surprise in store for him
when, entering the brig’s cabin, he saw seated at
the table, not the truculent, piratical ruffian he
expected to see, but a quiet, stout man of her-
culean proportions, who bowed politely and said,
“Welcome on board the Leonora, sir. Have you
come to seize my ship and myself? Well, now,
don’t apologise, but sit down a while until
my steward brings you a glass of wine, and
then I’ll go and see what all this is about.”
This officer afterwards told Hamilton that he was
so struck with Bully’s cool effrontery and his
equally genial smile that he did sit down and take
a drink, and then Hayes accompanied him to the
corvette. As the boat ran alongside the officers
and bluejackets not on duty thronged to the side
to see the famous, pirate, who walked calmly to
the quarter-deck, and, singling out the captain
(Meade, 1 think, was his name) said : “How do
you do, sir. l am happy to see my country’s flag
again in these seas ; but what the hell do you mean,
sir, by putting an armed crew on my deck i By
God, sir, if you don’t give me good reasons I 11
make you repent it.” The corvette captain stood
quite unmoved, although there was a suppressed
titter heard amongst his officers.
“ I pardon you your offensive language, Cap-
tain Hayes, as” I daresay you feel excited. If you
will come below I will show you good authority
for my action. I have orders to arrest you and
investigate serious charges against you. 1 trust,
however, that you will be able to clear yourself.”
The quiet, gentlemanly manner of the naval
officer acted like a charm upon Hayes. The
fierce glitter in his bright blue eyes died out, and
bowing to the corvette captain he turned to the
group of officers, and in a bluff, sincere manner
said: “Gentlemen, I apologise to your captain
and to you for my insulting manner. I see that
I have acted in an unbecoming way ; but I am a
hasty man, yet quick to make amends when I am
in the wrong.”
The officers returned his salute, and then Bully
went below and listened with an unmoved face to
the warrant for his arrest. He was allowed to
write a letter to his wife, and given the liberty of
the ship whilst the captain of the Narrangansett
was preparing for the trial. A notification was
sent to the three Consuls of his seizure, and asking
them to verify the charges made to them by
various persons against Hayes. None but the
German Consul responded, and his witnesses
(traders whose stations had been cleaned out by
Hayes) utterly broke down. One look at those
steady, steel-blue eyes was enough for them. They
knew what was in store for them if any of them
ever crossed Bully’s path again, and slunk away
to their German protectors. After two hours’
investigation, the captain broke up the court,
and formally told those present that he would
announce his decision in writing. As the German
Consul, followed by two German merchant
skippers, rose from the table, Hayes asked the
captain if he could say a few words. Leave was
granted.
“ I merely wish to tell those gentlemen leaving
that I hate liars—especially Dutch liars.”
“ You forget your position, sir,” said the
captain, turning away to hide a smile.
Two hours afterwards the Narrangansett’s
captain wrote a brief note to the Consuls, stating
that he would not —from the unreliable and con-
tradictory evidence —be justified in taking Hayes
to the United States, and added some severe
remarks about the skulking and terrified manner
of the witnesses.
Then Hayes was .told he was a free man and
straightway the prisoner became the guest, and
Bully made a neat little speech.
“Gentlemen, I thank you for your kindness and
courtesy to me. You have done me a good service.
If I went to the States now and told hpw I had
been seized by a tyrannical American officer, it
would make me a rich man, I could run for
President. I could get in, too. I could paint you
all as a crew of piratical ruffians disgracing the
uniform of the greatest country in the world, and
the papers would back me up. They would make
me President of a big bank, and would send all of
you to serve your country in Alaska —to keep you
from getting lynched by an indignant nation.
But I am just going to be good and generous and
remain in obscurity; and to-morrow night I shall
be proud and happy if you will honour me by

Tommy’s Hut.
(FOR THE BULLETIN.)
There’s a clearing in the ranges on the old bush-
road to Yea,
Where a shanty oriefe Was running in the old and
lawless way;
It was here the splitters rallied, and the drifting
traveller soaked,
And the drover, halting; tallied, and the billlocky
unyoked.
It was here the bushman melted down the fruits
of thrift and toil
In cooling draughts of chemicals and nips of fusel-
oil;
It was here they vied in “ shouting ” till the stilly
ranges rang.
And the muffled sounds of “clouting” mingled
with the songs they sang.
It was here the strangest stories, too, were told of
mining lodes —
Of the streaming strings of waggons that were
met upon the roads,
Till listless loungers started as the wondrous tale
was told,
And, sobering up, departed for the dazzling fields
of gold.
There were evenings at the shanty when you’d see
a stranger sight,
And the sound of tuneful voices, then, would fall
upon the night—
When homeless, hopeless wanderers softly sang
some sweet refrain,
And stealing o’er the squanderers the spirit, Rest,
would reign.
They were men who once had started with the
wildest hopes and dreams
That led them from the beaten track to breast the
flooded streams;
In their pride they scorned the compass, and
struck boldly on ahead,
But they noted not the ridges, nor to where the
gullies led.
They were nearer then, those revellers, in their
soft but saddened song#
As it bore them, circling, backward past the
marks they’d blazed along,
Nearer to the well-known places drifting slowly
into view#
With the dim, reproachful faces in the faintly-
surging blue.
Drifting often back so dimly, that the bushman,
filled with doubt,
Strains his eyes to see before him, wondering
where he might “come out,”
Till, in merciless revealing, passes by each Well-
known trace,
And,he sees, with senses reeling, that he’s “made ”
his starting place.
Tommy’s Hut has gone for ever with an age that’s
passed away,
And a grassy plot tells only of a wild, advcntutous
day,
And this scene of noisy riot sleeps ill silehce so
profound
That an air of deathly quiet seems td linger o’ef
the ground.
When the moonlight floods the ranges; ahd the
bush is cast in light—
And the messmate shells are standing, “ rung,” in
ghostly robes of white,
Pale shadows, fast assembling, steal froth scrub-
lined haunts around
And blacken, as they trembling fall athwart the
open ground.
It is then the lonely traveller, should he list, at
length may hear
In faint and feeble whispering words that fain
would reach his ear,
And with the dark enleadened scrawling shadows
strive to tell
Of the men the hush has deadened with its mystic,
subtle spell.

‘ ‘ I have been ill for
‘ 4 about five years,
‘ 1 have had the best
“medical advice,
‘ ‘ and I took the first
‘ ‘ dose in some doubt. This result-
ed in a few hours easy sleep; There
‘ ‘ was no further hemorrhage till next
* ‘ day, when I had a slight attack
“ which stopped almost immediate-
“ ly. By the third day all trace of
blood had disappeared and I had
‘‘recovered much strength. The
1 ‘ fourth day I sat up in bed and ate
*‘ my dinner, the first solid food for
“two months. Since that time I
“have gotten better and
“ am now able to move about the
“house. My death was daily ex-
pected and my recovery has been
' * a great surprise to my friends and
‘ * the doctor. There can be no doubt
* ‘ about the effect of German Syrup,
“as I had an attack just previous to
1 ‘ its use. The only relief was after
“ the first dose.” J.R. Roughhead,

WHAT CURES PIMPLES
A .
Li
The only really successful prevent-
ive and cure of pimples, blotches,
blackheads, red, rough* and oily skin,
and most complexional disfigurations*
is that greatest of all Skin Purifiers
and Beautifiers* the celebrated Cuti-
CURA Soap. For irritating and scaly
humors of the scalp, with dry br fall-
ing hair* red, rough hands, chaps*
painful finger ends with shapeless
nails, and simple humors bf the skill
and scalp of infancy and childhood, it
is simply infallible;
CUTICURA SOAP
A marvellous beautifier of world-wide celebrity, CUTICURA Soap is simply incom-
parable as a Skin-Purifying Soap, unequalled for the Toilet, and 'Without a rival for
the Nurseryi Absolutely pure* delicately medicated, exquisitely perfumed, it produces
the Whitest, clearest skin, and softest hands, and prevents inflammation and clogging
of the pores, the cause of pimples, blotches, blackheads, red and oily skin, and most
coinplexional disfigurations. It derives its remarkable medicinal properties from
Cuticura, the great skin cure, but so delicately are they blended with the purest of
toilet and nursery soap stoeks that the result is a medicated toilet soap incomparably
superior to all other skin and complexion soaps, while rivalling in delicacy and sur->
passing in purity the most noted and expensive of toilet and nursery soaps. For the
prevention of facial blemishes, for giving a brilliancy and freshness to the com- 1
plexlon, and for cleansing the scalp and invigorating the hair, it is without a peer,

“TALES OF the CONVICT SYSTEM.”
Ambulanciana.
(FOR THE BULLETIN.)
They had been married several years, and having
“no encumbrance,” she Was able to devote her
whole attention to his ailments, which were
changeable as the temper of man.
She was certainly a hard-worked slave, until
her emancipation was brought about by the plucky
person who first talked of starting a branch of the
Ambulance Society, in the township, I say
“plucky,” for assuredly he or she who attempts
to instil a new idea into the minds of the dwellers
in a small country town needs a tdugh hide and
unlimited brass.
Both requisites being to hand; the said person
secured an influential committee, who started a
branch of the Ambulance Society in the town-
ship of Three Peaks.
Someone asked the slave-wife to attend thC
classes; but received the reply that “ there is not
nearly time enough in the day as it is, without
wasting two hours a week On one’s inside, which
is bother enough already, goodness knows
referring, of course, to her husband’s inner
machinery. She was too busy to trouble about
her own;
When she told him of her refusal to join the
classes; his anger knew no bounds. “What!” he
cried. “Do you carry your selfishness even so far
as that ? Here, for the last three years, have you
been ignorantly putting down my fearful suffer-
ings to ’imagination’ or ‘fancy,’ never knowing
how to ease or support me; now, when the chance
to learn something of the pains I endure and of
their remedies is offered, literally thrust upon you,
you selfishly refuse to benefit by it. I beg you
will reconsider the matter and attend the classes
from first to last.”
It was as good as done ; she did attend them.
After the second lecture she sat one evening
looking over her notes of the first one, while he,
fidgeting uneasily about the room, at length
settled upon the corner of the table nearest her,
and held forth as usual.
“ Now, I do hope you are going in for this thing
thoroughly, and not in your usual slip-shod
fashion. I shall be willing to give any help I can,
provided I see some result. That’s the worst of
you women, you are all so half-hearted,”
“It’s nice to see you taking an interest in my
progress,” she answered, ignoring his slur upon
women’s zeal. “ I hope you won’t feel bored if I
talk a good deal of the ambulance just now-
one can’t well help it when one is very much in
earnest over a thing.”
“By Jove, now, that’s something like! I’ve
never known you so roused up before. Not even
when I’ve been at my worst.”
“ These bones are pretty difficult to remember
when one comes to over two hundred ; it’s a pretty
big effort to get the name and position of each
one.”
“I should think so ! What’s puzzling you just
this time ? ”
“ Assitabulum I never can remember that
one.”
“You should resort to artificial memory—keep it
in mind by associating it with another object.”
“ How clever of you, dearest! Of course / see
—As-si -tabulum —Yes, I know,” looking up at
him, “an ass sitting upon a table. Thanks,
awfully,”
“You needn’t be so beastly rude!’’—getting
off the table and walking to the window, while she
continued poring over her notes.
After the fifth lecture of the second course, she
told him there was now no further need to call in
a doctor, in any ordinary ailment or accident at
any rate, as she was perfectly confident of being
able to do all that would be needed, and what a
heap of money they could save !
There was something about the manner and
speech now, that he did not altogether like; an
absence of that cowed deference to himself and
his weaknesses, which had existed before she
joined the Ambulance and learnt what a deal of
pain and inconvenience may be caused by a
stretched muscle or an overstrained nerve.
At first he tried to frighten her into the old
attention to his least word of command : “ My
dear,” he would say, “ fetch me a little brandy—
quick ! ”
“ Feeling faint, sweetheart ? ” and rushing up
she seized his ears, and jamming his head down
between his knees held it there until his loud cries
for release caused her to remark i “You don’t
need the brandy now, dear, you’re quite yourself
again, otherwise ”•—holding his wrist—“ the pulsa-
tion in your radial brachial would be feebler.”
He didn’t feel faint any more.
When he declared that his sciatica caused such
agony as to be unendurable, she replied : “It’s
not sciatica, darling, and though painful it
doesn’t involve the slightest danger, so cheer up.
The fact is, your assitabulum (ass on the table—
you remember) fails to secrete sufficient synovial
fluid to lubricate its socket, thus causing you
some pain in moving your leg.”
“ Some pain - 1” but he did not press the
matter.
i n< n, one night, when he complained of head-
ache and swore he had inflammation of the brain
coming on, she merely said :
“ If you will drive for hours, on an afternoon
like this was, without a puggaree, the sun glaring
down upon your medulla oblongata ”
“ My oblong whatl ”
“Gata.”
“ I haven’t a garter about me ! ”
“ Yes ! your medulla oblongata—it’s no wonder
it aches afterwards. I shouldn’t be surprised if
the arteries supplying your cerebrum and cerebel-
lum are also a good deal congested.”
Ho fled gasping for breath.
One day he limped in bemo.aning a sprained
ankle, though there was no visible swelling. After
examination she gave it as her opinion that his
tarsals and metatarsals were out of all proportion
to his astragalus, so who on earth could expect
anything but weakness of the joints—and she in-
sisted on his stopping in bed for a week.
But his last struggle for supremacy and right
to invalidism came to naught when, on his
remarking that he had a new and horrible pain
“beginning about the middle of his back and
extending forwards and downwards,” she
appeared puzzled for a moment, then said slowly ;
“It may—be—from your intercostals, but it is
more likely that your aorta or your main
carotid has got a little mixed up with your com-
mon, external, and internal tliaes. The trouble
will probably descend to the femorals, from thence
to the popliteal, and so down the tibial and fibular
until mortification of the toes will bo the natural
result.”
She loft him with horror depicted in every
line of his countenance.
That was months ago, and he has never dared
to have even one ache since.
