ATIK’S HAIR VIGOR is unrivaled for
the restoration of faded and gray hair to its
original color and freshness, and for keeping
the scalp clean and healthy. The most popular
and elegant toilet preparation in the world, all
who use it, pronounce it, also, the best hair
grower. When the capillary glands become em
feehled by disease, age, or neglect, this dressing
imparts renewed life to the scalp, so that the
hair again assumes its original
Fullness and Beauty.
Ladies find that this preparation imparts to the
hair a silken pliancy and a delicate and lasting
fragrance. Gentlemen use it to prevent bald-
ness, to restore faded and gray hair to its former
color and abundance, and to relieve the scalp of
troublesome humors and dandruff. A proof of
the superiority of this preparation over all
others of the kind is the constantly-increasing
demand for it in all civilized countries.

SUFFERING FROM
BRAIN & NERVE EXHAUSTION;
Any man who in his youth has trifled away hia vigour
of body, mind, and manhood, should consult PRO-
FESSOR CARE STINKWAY, the Eminent Specialist,
in diseases of the Genito-Urinary Organs, who is still
treating with the greatest sliill and eucces-i all Private,
Nervous, and Chronic Diseases.
Professor STINEWAY’S great success, which has
become so lirpily established throughout Australasia,
is based upon the facts : - Ist. That every case treated,
even in its most remote effects, is specially’ studied,
thus starling aright. 2nd. The Medicines and Electric
Appliances used are exactly adapted to suit the case,
thus promptly producing results without overdosing
or injury.
I SEEK CASES WHERE ALL ELSE HAS FAILED.
Young and middle-aged men and others, who
suffer from Nervous and Physical Debility,
Exhausted Vitality, Premature Decline, Sc., can
recover the same degree of health, strength,
and energy experienced in former years, by
consulting (in / erson or by letter, which is free),
Professor CARL STINEWAY, who has restored
thousands of sufferers to vigorous manhood
after all other treatment had faded. It makes
no difference what you have taken, or who has
failed to cure you. Cases that / accept for treat-
ment are quickly and permanency cured,
DO ANY OF THE FOLLOWING SYMPTOMS
OR CLASS OF SYMPTOMS MEET YOUR
DISEASED CONDITION:- -Are you a sufferer
from bad health in any of its many forms, consequent
on a lingering Nervous, Chronic, or Functional
Disease ? Do you feel nervous, debilitated, fretful,
timid, and lack the pow oof will and action? Are
you subject to loss of memory ; have spells of faint-
ing ; fullness of blood n the head; feel listless,
moping, unfit for business or pleasure, and subject to
fits of melancholy ? Are your kidneys, stomach,
urinary organs, liver, or blood in a disordered con-
dition 7 Do you suffer from Rheumatism, Neuralgia,
or other aches and pains? Are yon timid, nervous,
and forgetful, with your mind continually dwelling
on the subject ? Have you lost confidence in yourself,
and energy for business pursuits? Are you subject
to restless nights, broken sleep, dreams, palpitation of
the heart, bashfulness, confusion of ideas, aversion
to society, dizziness in the head, dimness of sight,
pimples on the face and back, and other desponding
symptoms? If you are afflicted, why further neglect
your health or future happiness, when by a single
consultation (which costs nothing) you can be placed
on the way to health strength, and vigour?

I advertise because I consider it necessary that people
suffering from Nervous, Sexual and Chronic Complaints,
should be able to ascertain which
DULY•QUALIFIED PRACTITIONERS
make these Diseases a speciality, particularly as, under
the present law, any person can call himself Doctor or
Professor, whether he is entitled to do so or nut; and these
persons exist, chiefly, because Duly Qualified Prac-
titioners have not occupied the field
Dr. PERRY invites the fullest investigation into his
credentials, and gives his Personal Consideration to
each Case, and in all cases tells the Patient the exact
nature.of his complaint, the cost of a cure, and the time
it will take. '
Dr. PERRY’S experience in the treatment of these
Diseases has been so varied and extensive, that he is able
to tell absolutely whether the case is curable or not, and
therefore is willing to
Guarantee to CURE EVERY CASE he Undertakes.

Western Australia is a much richer cuiony than is
generally supposed as regards minerals, agriculture and
pastoralism.—Sir Samuel Griffith.
. Professor Brown, of Victoria, who made a thorough
examination of the south-western portion of Western
Australia, states that not the other colonies only, but
even the people of Western Australia evidently do not
know how much there is waiting for development. He
saw thousands of acres in contiguous blocks of fine choco-
late lands, light clay loams, and peaty soils. He thinks
the important features of the district are its grand climate
and regular rainfall.

time to the study of
PRIVATE, NERVOUS, AND SKIN
DISEASES.
He has by profound research thoroughly investi-
gated their origin, traced their deadly sources and
insidious dissemination, and ascertained the surest
and safest methods by which they may be eradi-
cated, with these widely recognised qualifications
combined with unswerving faithfulness to his
patients, he has during his practice, extending
over FORTY YEARS, attained a well-deserved
pre-eminence in their treatment. His practice
embraces diseases which probably cause more un-
happiness than any other class of troubles that
afflict mankind.

may be as well to let them know that there is such
an j rticle as JOSEPHSON’S OINTMENT purely
theproductionof thecolony, composed of wild plants
indigenous to the country and nowhere else, the
principal of which is the EUCALYPTUS, now
so famed thoroughout the world.
Josephson’s Ointment is purely vegetable, and
Guaranteed Free from all Poisclnous

Green colour is extracted from the pure green
plants, which defy imitation.

when one application will relieve you?
Read this letter and Try for Yourselves
Messrs. E. Row and Co.
Dear Sirs, —I have tried your Josephson’s Oint-
ment for Piles, and have found much relief from
using it. You are at liberty to use this if you feel
disposed.

STUDY HEALTH BY TAKING ROW’S
STEANE’S BITTERS.
The great demand throughout the colony for
these pure Bitters shows they are superior to all
others and equalled by none.
Facts Speak Louder than Words.
Read this sworn testimony from a well-known
citizen: —
Statutory Declaration.
“I, George Hewett, do hereby solemly and
sincerely declare as follows :
“That I feel it a duty I owe to the public to
state that I have been suffering for many years
from weakness of the stomach, so called INDI-
GESTION or DYSPEPSIA, and have been cured
by my taking two or three glasses of ROW’S
STEANE’S BITTERS a day in a little water, and
I hope others suffering from the same complaint
will be as speedily cured.
“(Signed) G. HEWETT,
“ 215 Pitt-streeb.
Row’s Steane’s Wine
Is a safe and sure stimulant for the female sex or
children, for it raises and strengthens depressed
systems without producing a temporary excite-
ment to be followed by greater depression.
Persons suffering from loss of appetite and
general depression of spirits cannot do better than
ROW’S STEANE’S WINE.
It cannot harm you, but must do good to all
delicate persons. Young Ladies can take this
when suffering from general debility. It’s only a
pure tonic. Try it.
Teetotallers will find this newly-invented
TONIC answer all the purposes of a stimulant
without its intoxicating quality. It will satisfy
the cravings of nature and create a desire for food
instead of drink. As an anti-febrile is unsur-
passed.
ROW’S

BITTERS.
We recommea these BITTERS to be taken
two or three times a day ; a wineglassful for an
adult, smaller quantity for children.

The action of dandelion, more especially upon
the liver and kidneys, in more reliable for remov-
ing all impure secretions than any other medicinal
plant known.

these Bitters invaluable.
DIRECTIONS FOR USE.
One wineglass two or three times a day after
meals diluted with same quantity of water. For
young people about half the quantity twice a day.

about them.
Messrs. E. Row and Co.
With thanks for forwarding me a bottle of your
Row’s Dandelion Bitters, and consider them most
excellent, and superior to many others that I have
previously tried. Yours faithfully, HENRY
CHARLES CURTIS, M.R.C.S., England.
Port Adelade, October 30, 18SG.
Read an expression of thankfulness received
from the undersigned :
“I have for many years been obliged to take
medicines of different kinds for affections of the
liver, indigestion, pain in the chest, general de-
bility, feeling of nervousness, weariness, great
depression of spirits, and so on, but all without
producing any beneficial effect, till at last, being
recommended to try ROW’S DANDELION
BITTERS, which, happily, I find has produced
an unexpected and wonderful effect and change
in my system, and has removed from my mind
the horrible depressed feeling and former con-
dition of bodily ailment I have so unhappily ex-
perienced for so many years.
“ I am glad of the opportunity to make known
the excellent qualities of ROW’S DANDELION
BITTERS, that those who are atfieted as I have
been may take advantage of them.
“ I remain, dear sirs,

SATURDAY, SEPTEMBER 27, 1890.
Substance and Shadow.
Throughout the civilised and semi-civilised
world, every man, unless his faculties have
remained dormant, as in the cases of Rus-
sian serfs and British clodhoppers, or unless
his energies have been paralysed by sheer
hopelessness, struggles to become richer
than he is. There are, of course, a few
exceptions besides those indicated above.
The inheritors of great properties, especially
of real estate, are sometimes more concerned
to extract enjoyment out of their incomes
than to increase them. The general rule is,
nevertheless, as we have stated. Every man
who thinks he has a chance tries in some
fashion to become rich, and many who have
no chance crave for wealth. The fact that
so universal a tendency exists might con-
vince, and, indeed, generally has convinced,
people that wealth must be worth striving
for. Broadly speaking, everybody strives
or longs for it. Surely, it is argued, every-
body cannot be wrong. This is, however,
an exceedingly specious sort of contention.
In the first place, it is easy to show that, in the
main, everybody has been wrong, from as far
back as there are records of human existence,
—up to our own time. Until very lately,
for example, everybody was wrong about tliu
sun, the shape or the earth and a host of
other physical conditions. Again, until
about 15 or 16 centuries ago, everybody was
wrong with respect to the relations between
God and man, and if Christianity be a
divine revelation, nearly everbody is
wrong in that respect now, since
Christians are hut a small minority
among the earth’s peoples. There are, in
fact, very few matters respecting which
people have been right. Successive changes
of opinion, frequently proceeding to actual
reversals, adopted by successive generations
respecting almost every conceivable subject,
sufficiently demonstrate this perversity. But
it has to be admitted that the lust of wealth
and the lust of the flesh have been constant
at all times, among all peoples, and under
all conditions, although other things have
perpetually been shifting. It might conse-
quently be argued that these are natural,
unalterable, and, inferentially, proper ten-
dencies, based upon an instinct divinely
implanted in the human mind.
* # #
This position, however, could not be sus-
tained, on an appeal to prevalent opinion to-
day, with respect to one of these impulses—
the lust of the flesh. Modern theories,
civil and theological, insist that this passion
is unlawful and sinful, if carried beyond
certain narrow limitations. The law-giver
threatens the trespasser beyond bounds with
punishment in this life ; the theologian
commands mankind to mortify their desires
and imprecates the wrath to come if they
neglect this duty. Hence it may be in-
ferred that the universal striving after
wealth can find no certain justification either
in the argument of universality or of anti-
quity. It is as open to cavil as any mere
personal eccentricity, and is subject to the
same critical challenge. The question may
be dealt with without any reverence for pre-
conceptions. There is not necessarily any
effrontery in questioning even whether the
pursuit of wealth, although universal, is a
natural impulse at all. It is scarcely requisite
to say that the accumulation of wealth rests
under no divine sanctum. Christians find it
irreconcilable with the injunctions of their
Master, and the High Priests—those Bishops
and those Ministers who preach to monarchs,
capitalists and thriving traders—find it
mightily embarrassing to reconcile their
Scriptures with the complaisances necessary
to maintain comfortable relations with their
flocks,
* * *
Man, in this as in other instances, mis-
takes the shadow for the substance. It is not
natural for man to seek wealth. But it is
natural for man to seek happiness. The
universal error is that of imagining that
because Poverty entails wretchedness and
suffering, wealth ensures ease and happiness.
Every very poor man knows that money
would relieve his troubles. So widely is it
recognised that poverty and pain are in-
separable, that language has moulded itself
to the impression, and to speak of a man as
very poor, and as being in “distressed cir-
cumstances ” are synonymous expressions.
The poor man who knows that a little cash
would ease him a little, reasons that a good
deal would ease him considerably ; that a
competence would banish trouble from his
heart; and that wealth would render him
perfectly happy. This reasoning is sup-
ported by the observation, which is within
everyone’s reach, that loss of wealth causes
the loser instant pain ; that a millionaire
groans when reduced to the ownership of a
paltry hundred thousand pounds.
# # *
Poverty also produces vice. Very rich
men do not steal, or burgle, or cheat. Rich
damsels do not go on the streets. As
Tennyson’s “ Northern Farmer ” remarks :
“The poor i’ the loomp is bad.” These
things are mere truisms. Everybody knows
how bad the poor are—and more. It is
nobody’s interest to throw a veil over their
wickedness. Here is a family. The parents
were decent folks; the father a capable
mechanic; the mother a smart tradesman’s
daughter. She could play upon the piano,
when she was, like Mrs. Micawber, “ at
home with Papa and Mamma.” The pair
have had eight children. The father suffered
from rheumatic fever, and contracting a stiff-
joint, became an inferior workman. Dire
poverty ensued. The family of ten habited
a four-roomed “house” in a back terrace
with a pestilential backyard, as extensive as
a shoe-trunk. The evenings in this domicile
were not gay or attractive. The elder
children spent them abroad, and went into
society a good deal. Mary Anne was a
sweet babe and a nice, tractable little lass.
It was her pride and pleasure to get father’s
mid-day snack ready and to carry it to him
at work in a snowy napkin. She never
wearied and never failed. She was her
mother's joy, and it was not in the maternal
heart to insist that the girl, when approach-
ing womanhood, should pass her evenings in
the evil-smelling hovel, in semi-darkness.
So she went into society a good deal, and
her sweet temper and warm heart made her
a general favourite in the worst circles.
Everybody loved her—especially one young
mail. That is Mary Anne now in the dock at
the Water Police Court. That? Yes, that
young woman with the bloated face, the
touzled hair, the torn and unfastened frock,
who receives her seventh sentence as a dis-
orderly person with a shriek of saw-sharpening
laughter, followed by a volley of filthy
ribaldry. Her younger sister is also in
society. Her brothers are—but why con-
tinue the picture, they are “ what one
might expect.” Yes, poverty occasions
suffering and produces vice.
* * *
But turn to this picture. My Lord Earl
is exceedingly wealthy. My Lady was a
celebrated beauty. There are eight children
in this family also. Lord Luxe is the heir.
He is frank and open-handed. Money is no
object with him. His valet has opened a
bank-account, merely with the loose change
which is never missed from his pockets and
his dressing-table. That valet was honest
originally, but constant opportunity has
made a thief of him. Lord Luxe has had
affairs of gallantry. Young men will be
young men. He took a fancy to go “slum-
ming,” at a time when there was a ridiculous
fuss about the condition of the poor. It was
then that he met a young wench, very pretty
and amiable. He has lost sight of her lately.
She began to be fretful and to talk absurdly
about marriage. Her name was Mary
Anne. There was also a little milliner. But
she got to know who he was, and he behaved
handsomely to her. It cost him “a monkey.”
She went to Paris with the money and is
quite a celebrity. And there was that baby-
faced chit from the railway refreshment-
rooms. She understood that he was Mr.
Jones. Wanted to make a scene at the
railway-station one day. About her condi-
tion. Never travelled that line for months
after, till his man told him the girl had
left the refreshment-room, and that the
new girl was “ very ’andsome.” Went then,
and had some hopes in that quarter till
an infernal porter recognised him as Mr.
Jones, and told him, with curses, that the
baby-faced chit had been troubled with an
additional baby-face, and had got into trou-
ble for leaving it in a shop. Lord Luxe is
disgusted with the insolence of the lower
orders. Would get Smithers, the director-
fellow, whom they admitted to one of his
clubs lately, to dismiss that porter, only he
doesn’t care to appear in the matter himself.
Has no doubt that porter knows as much as
anybody about the paternity of the brat he
talks about.
# # #
My Lord Luxe’s sisters are highly-accom-
plished and virtuous young ladies. No one
of them was ever out of sight of her Ladyship
the Countess, of a governess, or of a cha-
perone for ten minutes in her whole life.
The Hon. Felicia is, however, in love with
Captain Hauton, who has not five hundred
a year besides his pay—a mere pauper.
Felicia knows it is useless to hope. She is
thoroughly wretched, and will become an
exceedingly sour old maid. Ambrosia, on
the other hand, has married a baronet. She
is consumed with mortification because Miss
Smith, whose father was a brewer, and whom
she would not have allowed to lace her boots,
has been married by Viscount Spoor, and is
taken in to dinner before her. Olympia had
a fit of hysterics last week because the Hon.
Augusta Noodle eclipsed her at the Duchess
of Swellingshire’s ball. The Earl himself
has gout, has quarrelled with his man of
business, and has no peace day or night
because he knows his people swindle him
and he can’t stop it. Besides, the Prince
gave him only two fingers the other evening,
and shook hands with Lord Grovel, who is
only a Baron. How can he be happy after
such a slight ? The Countess is also wretched.
She is becoming fatter. Lady Grovel dared
to condole with her. She hears that that
wretch, Snap, the literary person whom my
Lord admits to his table to amuse people
with his so-called wit, had remarked at some
of his low haunts that anyone could tell that
her Ladyship was troubled, by her dreadful
sighs. By her dreadful size the wretch
meant, of course.
* * *
In short, each member of the family has
his or her particular wretchedness. The
accessories of wealth possess for them no
alleviating influence. To drive in a splendid
carriage is a monotony. To visit entertain-
ments is a bore. A beautiful horse is a
child’s toy—a pleasure for a moment, then
forgot and unconsidered. The constant
odour of roses is sickening. The complexion
so sedulously sheltered from the sun becomes
so tender that a stray beam freckles. The
skin bathed in asses’ milk is so soft that it
chafes at a touch. The temper, petted by
constant compliances, warps at a trifle. The
things one can have at a wish lose all value
and attraction. The pampered inclination
yearns for just those things which wealth
cannot purchase, and the infant of luxury
craves for the unattainable, and “ won’t be
happy till he gets it.” “ Contentment,” says
the sage, “is great riches.” Discontent is a
sort of poverty, consequently.
# # #
Contentment and happiness are practically
convertible terms. The problem, then, is
not how to become rich, but how to attain
contentment. Yet even this is not easy of
solution. In the “Arabian Nights’ Entertain-
ment,” Alnasghar, the barber’s sixth brother,
receives his few piastres of patrimony. He in-
vests it in a basket of crockery, and ponders
on the future. He will sell his crockery for
twice what it cost him, and re-invest the
proceeds. By and bye he will open a stall
in the bazaar. The gains of this establish-
ment will enable him to give up the crockery
business, and trade in jewellery. In this
profitable occupation he will soon become
possessed of ample means. That ought to
content him. Not so, though. What is a
mere jeweller, after all. Who salaams to
him ? The vizier’s mere servants hustle him
in the street. He must have obeisances and
prostrations. He will heap up more wealth,
and make the vizier so dazzling a present
that lie will cede him his daughter in
marriage. And when the bride is brought
to him, and the twain are left alone, he will
gratify his self-esteem. What is a vizier’s
daughter, after all 1 He will deal her a
thrust with his foot—so ! And over went
his basket of crockery as he suited the act to
the thought.
* * #
Mr. Grunt has made a great fortune. He
is one of the wealthiest men in Australia. It
is so long ago since he was a sweep that he
has nearly forgotten it. He would have for-
gotten it altogether if other people would.
But they won’t—which makes him wretched.
Rich and wretched ! He will go to England
where no one will know. How is this ? He
is worse off than in Australia. There are
houses he cannot enter. There are people
who won’t know him. They are richer than
he, and talk about birth and blood. Rage
consumes him. He will never know what
happiness means because he cannot buy
“ blood ” and he cannot get himself “ born.”
He lavishes tens of thousands. He becomes
a pillar (of gold) to a great Party. He
secures a title—a peerage. He pays the
highest possible fees to the Herald’s office,
and with the polite aid of that establishment
he is actually born again. He is the male
representative in a direct line of the De
Gerounts, of whom the first, Sir Bracey
De Gerount, came over with the Conqueror.
In vain. Having quarrelled with Lord Luxe,
that infernal dandy actually remarked that
he declined to dispute with any scion of a
swine-herd, even although it were one
attached to the kitchen-department of
William I.
* # *
But if poverty involves misery and wealth
cannot endure happiness, what is to be done?
lit seems useless to turn the attention upon a
middling condition, a moderate competency
For there is no stability in these matters'
People either get poorer or richer. Besides
there are the children. A modest coin!
potency for a pair of parents makes a paltry
provision when divided among nalf-a-dozen
children. And when it comes to be further
divided among grandchildren, poverty
is reached again. The fact is that
as conditions stand, there exists no solm
tion of the problem. In order to find
the settlement, it will be requisite first to
alter the conditions. What the people of
this world need is rest —cessation of striving
cessation from struggling, cessation from
trampling, one on another. How in Heaven’s
name is this to be secured ? At this
the answer becomes plain. By substituting
Co-operation for Competition. By so im
arranging the social order, that every man
shall be every other man’s helper and com-
rade, instead of his competitor and rival.
The Law of Demand and Supply.
When those who own the earth wish to
perpetrate some new swindle for their own pro-
fit and for the further exploitation of the poor
they are always careful to explain that their
actions are directed by the “ unchangeable and
inexorable law of Demand and Supply.” When
wages go down, as they invariably do unless
forcibly sustained by the combination of Labour
this invisible and impersonal influence is alone
responsible, and when wages go up, which
happens occasionally, they always rise in d e fh
ance of the unwritten code of industry, for
which reason the organs of Capital are filled
with ominous warnings of evil to come through
the sinful unreasonableness of the aggressive
toiler. Consequently, through much vociferous
iteration the world has at last accepted the
theory that the Law of Demand and Supply is
a purely external power which, like the Deity
itself, is placed beyond human control, and it
is generally understood that sooner or later this
unseen force will have its way, and that it can
no more be stayed in its course than the stars
themselves. Very few attempt to encpiire why
it is that the Capitalist should be the high priest
and interpreter of the commercial oracle which
invariably prophesies for his benefit. When the
inspired seer Joseph Smith received divine
revelations regularly, and every revelation, sup-
ported by Smith’s evidence alone, set forth that
some new effort must be made for the further
glory of Smith himself, the devout Mormon
obeyed in wonderment, and only prayed at
times that his apostle might be inspired to keep
awake a little more, and to ease off in his com-
munion with the voice of Providence. And
similarly, when the utterance of the unseen
god of commerce informs the Capitalist that
circumstances require that wages should go
down, or that the hours of Labour should be
extended, the world too often merely expresses
its regret that the Law of Demand and Supply
should require the sacrifice, and submits more
or less reluctantly. Who or what this law is,
or where it is to be found, or by whom it was
invented, very few can tell. In common with
the Devil, it bears the responsibility of every
fraudulent action which nobody is responsible
for, and, like the Devil, is in itself responsible for
nothing, because nobody can find it or call it to
account.
# # #
The basis of this great economic force is the
desire of the privileged class to get all it wants,
and give nothing, or as little as possible, in
return. Consequently, the law of demand and
supply has always fixed the maximum of labour
as high and the minimum of remuneration as
low as the privileged classes had power to fix
them. "When capitalist was backed up by
violence and armed force, so that he could exact
labour on his own terms, then the unwritten
code of industry always reduced the reward of
labour to the lowest point. So long as slavery
was lawful, the political economist who owned
slaves was prepared to demonstrate that Nature
had so adjusted the balance, as to make it abso-
lutely necessary that a large section of the
human race should toil incessantly without any
remuneration at all, except a few precarious
rags, a shattered roof, and sundry scraps of
coarse food. The slave-owner frequently ex-
pressed his regret that the laws of economy
should render such a state of things unavoid-
able, but it was generally understood that
demand and supply was a principle altogether
beyond human control, and any individual who
endeavoured to overset it by force was a reckless
iconoclast, fooling with the immutable decrees
of Providence. Something went wrong with
the great principle at last, however, and it was
forcibly overset by grapeshot and other extraneous
agencies, and yet nothing in particular hap-
pened. The supply stopped and the demand
still went on, and there was no economic
disaster worth mentioning. A few capitalists
who had lived on their fellow-men came to grief
when they could live on their fellow-men no
longer, for the much-vaunted “demand is
merely the demand of the rich to be allowed to
plunder the poor, and the “supply” merely
arises out of the fact that the poor, through
their ignorance, generally submit to lie plun-
dered ; but when this process is suddenly sus-
pended, it involves no more disaster than would
the sudden suspension of human sacrifices in
Dahomey. There, the great annual festival oi
So-Sin creates a demand for living victims, and
the demand existing the supply naturally
follows. To the Dahoman economist, no doubt,
any interference with this natural process would
be the herald of industrial ruin anduphea\al,
but some day the process will be stopped none
the less, and Dahomey will still, in all proba-
bility, remain where it is. Even should it fan
to do so, the world wall be very little the worse.
# * *
The so-called “ law” is false and artificial in
every respect. The principle on which it is


based requires that the Australian worker shall
labour for eight hours at a certain remuneration,
a nd the Englishman and the American for ten ;
while the unhappy Hindoo in the cotton-fac-
tories of Bombay is required to toil for fourteen,
aixteen, or even eighteen hours per diem for
only one-fourth of the payment granted to his
white competitor. In each case the employer
claims that hours and wages are practically ad-
justed by an economic force which is beyond
bis control; in other words, the law of demand
and supply is founded on the fact that the em-
ployer demands the eartli and is supplied with
as much of it as he can get. In theory, the
proportion of people to capital engaged is sup-
posed to have some connection with the matter ;
but as the same law which requires that the
capitalist should receive 50 per cent, in Aus-
tralia, when he is unable to get more, demands
that he should get 500 per cent, in India under
almost identical circumstances, this explanation
necessarily falls to the ground. Moreover,
when the progress of knowledge and discovery
opens out a promising field for the perpetration
of some hitherto unknown swindle upon Labour,
this alleged economic law at once demands that
that swindle should be put in motion. When
the brass idol in the Asiatic temple sends forth
its discordant scream to affright a crowd of
servile worshippers, it always does so in repro-
bation of some insult to the privileged class, for
the simple but sufficient reason that that class
alone knows the secret of the machinery by
which the divinity yells ; and as the capitalist
runs the great principle of demand and supply,
it naturally follows that the principle invariably
calls upon him to do anything by which he can
make a rise and acquire property ; and if some
million unfortunates are ruined or starved by
the processs, the economic command is alone
responsible.
* * *
Consequently when the cheap kanaka became
available for employment on the sugar-planta-
tions of tropical Australia, the law of economic,
science at once required that the white man
should go and the low-priced nigger should take
his place, and when the cheap Chinaman in-
vaded the labour-market the same lofty axiom
was applied in his favour. The system of de-
mand and supply being simply a system by
which the employer demands everything he can
get and wants more, these two inexpensive
aliens were at once recognised as essential parts
of the great industrial machine which is under-
stood to be run and greased by an all-seeing
Providence, and when a reckless generation
threatened to eject the South Sea Islander and
the Mongol there was a general feeling in many
affluent circles that no good could come of this
impious monkeying on the part of men with the
designs of Heaven. Yet the Islander is practi-
cally gone and the Mongol is inevitably going,
and industry progresses just the same. Either
the law of supply and demand has been
strangely misinterpreted, or else that law does
not exist at all to any extent worth speaking of,
and the yell of the industrial idol is only an
empty note of war which goes forth every time
the capitalist pulls the string.
# * *
It is noteworthy, too, that the immutable
law which gets into such active operation when-
ever Labour attempts to gain the smallest con-
cession is invariably suspended when Capital
in any shape would be the loser by its existence.
The immense standing armies of Europe, for
example, exist solely for the benefit of the
privileged classes, for to the labourer it really
matters nothing whether his country is lost or
not; his country Avould lie no loss to him under
any possible circumstances. But the Capitalist
demands that his property shall be defended at
an infinitesimal cost, and so the ranks of
these armies are filled by a process which
outrages all the laws of political economy. Even
the cheapest European soldier would probably
decline to be speared and prodded and bayoneted
and shot and otherwise bruised and shattered
in the innumerable ways incident to his pro-
fession for less than 18s. per Aveek, if his wages
Avere left to be fixed by the ordinary market-
value of labour, and consequently the law of
demand and supply is set aside and conscription
and forced service take its place. The wage of
the Continental soldier is simply the smallest
sum which he can be kicked and cajoled into
accepting ; the wage of the ordinary worker is
the smallest amount which he can be starved
into accepting. The method of discovering how
much the labourer should be paid for his ser-
vices is strangely akin to the methods by which
Truth is brought to light in the Chinese courts
of justice. The mandarin of Yun-nan or Shen-
see resolves in his own mind what evidence
ought to be given under certain circumstances
and the required statements are generally forth-
coming. The demand for certain facts being
first created the supply naturally follows, so long
as the Avitness is bambooed hard enough. If it
Avere possible for the witness to reverse the order
of proceedings, now and then, and bamboo the
judge for a change, that person would doubtless
feel that the natural laws of supply and demand
had been strangely outraged and placed at
defiance, and similarly when Labour for once
applies coercion to Capital, after having been
itself coerced for centuries, the employers’ pro-
test against this glaring infringement of the
laws of economy is loud and long and intensely
indignant.
* * *
The theory of the capitalist is that Labour
should find its oavii market-value by a system of
free and open competition. Capital itself detests
open competition. The stock-jobber who makes
a corner in shares, the broker who protects him-
self by the rules of the Exchange from the
annoyance of outside rivalry, the hiAvyer whose
guild makes regulations compelling suitors to
employ his services at his own valuation in
cases Avhere they are entirely superfluous, would
all go mad with holy indignation if the rule
Avhieh they Avish to enforce upon the humble
toiler Avere applied equally to themselves. The
clergyman avlio endeavours to shut out the
unlicensed artisan in souls by insisting on the
laying on of hands or some similar ceremonial
as a preliminary qualification is in the same
category Avith the merchant avlio combines
with his fellow-traders to force up the price
of some particular staple For many months
past the Australian shipping trade has been
in a state of chaos, because almost every ship-
owner has been engaged in a frenzied effort to
ruin some rival in order that he might be free
from competition and in a position to charge the
same exorbitant rates which prevailed in the
good old past. The physician and the land-
boom liar, the Associated Banks and the
politician who is protected by a property
qualification, are all engaged to-day in an
attempt to “ corner ” some branch of industry
and to protect themselves from open competi-
tion, and they are all alike busily employed in
breaking-up the great law of demand and
supply. But the effort to make a corner in
Labour is a thing which is awful in its ghastly
iniquity. Every other section of humanity is
forming combinations to plunder the world at
large ; every one takes all he can get by force
and fraud and unholy artifice, and is for ever
compounding new schemes to take still more,
and all are as insatiable in their demands as the
daughters of the horse-leech with the original
parent thrown in. But Labour is to take what is
given to it and be grateful. The law of demand
and supply requires that it should do so, and as
Capital has already annexed the earth, how
much is left ?
PLAIN ENGLISH.
An Incitement to Revolt.
The other day the present writer saw an under-
sized man in workman’s garb being conveyed
through a Sydney street under arrest by five
muclpbarbered and elaborately-tailored persons,
apparently special constables. Two held the
prisoner’s arms, one walked alongside, two
brought up the rear, and one of these
latter could not help occasionally giving
the man, who was going along quietly
enough, an occasional and obviously un-
necessary shove to expedite his movements.
The spectacle, which elicited a loud and
spontaneous groan from several who witnessed
it, was one calculated to rouse the blood of
every man who had ever worn moleskins. It
looked like a glimpse of civil war. It seemed
a public challenge of mortal combat from the
classes to the masses. The spectacle of a man
under arrest is at no time an inviting one, but
the jar is minimised when the arrestor wears
the ordinary uniform of the Law. In that case
he is felt to represent the State, the authority
of which, even in its commission of the most
cruel wrongs, all citizens intuitively recognise.
But in the other case, when you see the scented
members of Society, with a scarcely-suppressed
air of triumph, dragging a wage-slave along
the public streets, the sight says to every fibre
of your being: This is a picture of the great
actual fight—which is about to commence—the
fight between broadcloth and moleskin,
between the men of shiny hats and the men of
battered felts, between the few men who Have
and the men who Have Not, and who are as the
sands of the sea in number. While that citizen
of low estate was being dragged through the
street by men of Good Society, several
uniformed policemen were standing about
to whom the workman could surely have been
handed over. The New South Wales authorities
say they want peace and order. If they do, let
them make to the masses no tacit intimation, or
anything which may be construed as such, that
they have placed special power in the hands of
those whose class is openly antagonistic to
the great mass of the people whom they are
deputed to control. The people will cordially
help the ordinary police, who, as a rule, do their
duty without any display of feeling ; but should
the representatives and parasites of wealth (for
such they appear chiefly to be), entitled
“ special constables,” overstep the strict limits
of their legal power by a hair’s-breadth, the
result will indeed be disastrous. A considerable
part of the influence exercised by the regular
police over the masses is due to the fact that
they are drawn from the ranks of the working-
population, and it will be well for the authorities
everywhere if in appointing special constables
this circumstance is kept steadily in view. It is
no answer to say that any reputable citizen who
chooses can be sworn in ; the prominence of the
wealthy and the cockily-attired immediate
dependents of the wealthy is calculated, in the
event of street-disturbances, to arouse the
deadliest hatred between the rich and the poor.
A Suicide’s Bond.
At Maitland (N.S.W.) the other day Mr. Denis
M ‘Can n attempted ineffectually to cut short his
earthly career, and, failing in the attempt, he
was arrested in due course and committed for
trial at the Quarter Sessions. Finally the Law,
having carefully considered Mr. M ‘Gann’s mor-
bid craving for death, ordered him to give his
bond in the sum of £200 as security that he will
continue alive for twelve months, and to find a
friend who will stake £50 on the same pre-
carious issue. Or, in other words, Mr. M'Cann’s
friend, if he can find one, is to bet the Govern-
ment £50 to nothing that the defendant will
find life worth having for one year from date,
and if that unhappy offender fails to take a
cheerful view of things and brings himself to a
sudden end, the man who backed him will be
required to pay up. These arrangements are
not supposed to be a legal penalty for the
offence of attempted suicide, for M ‘Gann’s
bond of £200 can only be collected when that
gentleman is dead or badly damaged in some
future attempt to be dead, and only a Govern-
ment with four legs and two unnaturally-pro-
longed ears can possibly hope to recover £200
or any other sum from Denis when his decease
has been successfully accomplished; while, so
far as regards the man who is required to make
an unholy bet with the Government, it probably
matters very little to Denis, either alive or
dead, whether that reckless plunger loses his
money or not. Yet, regarded as a preventive
measure adopted for the purpose of scaring the
would-be corpse off his ill-judged project, the
scheme is miserably defective. If Mr. M‘Gann
blows his brains out successfully, the State, as
we have already pointed out, will collect no
money from him, and t he State, which would
collect the deceased’s bond from his widow and
orphans — should he have any -• would be
meaner than a skunk or any other known
reptile. The fact that his reckless supporter
had £SO to lose by Denis being dead would
make no difference in the final result, for Denis
would be dead all the same. And if the second
attempt at suicide proved a failure, like the
first, and the criminal only blew his ear off, and
part of the roof of his head, and shifted one
eye, still the State could only collect the forfeit
if Denis owned the amount, and it is ten chances
to one that he does not. A man with £2OO on
hand seldom desires to meet with a violent
death before his time. Even supposing the
amount to be forthcoming, however, no reason-
able being can imagine that a man, avlio has
shot off five or six of his most important organs,
is likely to be reconciled to life, and filled with
joy and contentment through having his furni-
ture sold up and his goods auctioned on top of
his other misfortunes, and yet this is exactly
the method by which Mr. M ‘Gann’s craving for
death is to be quenched on its next appearance.
Evidently the Court went on the assumption
that he loved his furniture more than his
life ; but as he was found in a serious endea-
vour to start for a world where the furni-
ture could not possibly accompany him, this
idea is based on very insufficient evidence.
No doubt, if the defendant had any of the
finer feelings of humanity he might realise
that it would be a beastly selfish thing to die
and thereby cost another man £SO, but there is
no evidence to show that he had any finer feel-
ings at all. Possibly the idea which infested
the bench was that £250 Avas the smallest sum
which could compensate the Government for
the loss of Denis, but the reason why the State
should yearn in such an extravagant manner
over one plain citizen is not apparent, and this
explanation is too improbable for belief. The
whole scheme virtually resolves itself into a
mean attempt to extort money out of a corpse.
It matters nothing at all to the Government
whether Mr. M‘Cann is alive or dead, but see-
ing that he apparently intends to be dead, it
attempts by a base, unfeeling dodge, to bet on
what it regards as a certainty. And if Mr.
M'Cann refused to take a hand in this nefarious
transaction he would, no doubt, have been sent
to prison for declining to gamble on his own
funeral. The spectacle of a nation tossing up
Avith Death for the sum of £250 is too pitiable
for expression.
♦
The Decay of Individualism.
The Australasian, of all papers upon this
earth, has started to lament the decay of
Individualism, This is how it sets about it
The individual is treated as if he were but a small part
of a machine. Instead of being- free, instead of acting on
his own judgment and making what contracts he thinks
fit with his employers, he is but like a small wheel in a
great piece of machinery whenever the Trades-hall agita-
tors choose to turn on the steam. In the bundle of
faggots he is but one stick, and ho must submit to he
kicked, as the intelligence of a strike committee, or its
want of intelligence, may dictate. And if the much-
talked-of union of unions is to be created, his individuality
will become more and more shadowy, until it finally
vanishes. A Melbourne artisan is now liable to be
ordered on strike because of some dispute in the interior.
Even the poor dock labourers of London may be ordered
to cease work because some Riverina squatter refuses to
bow his head to the rules of the Shearers’ Union. It is
nothing to these unfortunate men that they are ignorant
of the causes of quarrel; they must obey ®r be loaded
with opprobrious epithets and be expelled from their own
unions.
Prophet of immortal hogwash! Apostle of drivel!
What is this ? Surely even the Australasian
must knoAV that the kind of individualism it
howls after is as dead as the priests of Baal
and Ashtaroth. Isn’t the Melbourne artizan
liable to be called to arms—as Avell as called
out on strike—because some unhung Czar has
trodden on the tail of a Kuzzilbash chief among
the mountains of Afghanistan, and doesn’t the
Australasian whoop for this state of things
and call it Loyalty ! Isn’t Sydney liable to be
bombarded because a Kaiser with a deranged
brain and a diseased ear—the son of another
Kaiser with a diseased throat—is raising Tophet
in Belgium, and the same soulful print calls this
patriotic fervour ? And, Averse still, is not the
Briton of to-day still paying countless millions
because the British Indian Avas hired to go out
and scalp the French Indian beside the Missis-
sippi some 150 years ago, and the Australian
Tory editor calls this maintaining the glorious
traditions of the Empire. And isn’t New
South Wales still paying the interest on the
money it cost to go out and slaughter niggers
in the far-off Soudan ? And if it is slavery
and bondage when the Avorkman voluntarily
consents that he will suffer a certain measure of
inconvenience for his own protection and that
of his brother-toiler in another land, why is it
liberty and lofty patriotism for the same
person to be bayonetted or shot without
his consent, and neither for his oavh protection
nor that of anybody else, but merely for the
profit and gratification of some imperial flunkey
abroad ? Individualism, pure and simple and
absolute, means the abolition of Irav, the disso-
lution of States, the repudiation of all national
engagements, and the handing over of the Argus
and Australasian to anybody avlio is strong
enough to come and take it, and if that paper
wants Individualism it may as Avell have the
whole of it, and not merely a disjointed frag-
ment. And if the labourer who, for his oavii
purposes, backs out of a trade combination
Avhieh he entered into of his own free Avill
should not be assailed by “opprobrious
epithets,” then there is no visible reason why
the Australasian .should heave opprobrious
epithets at the Irish Nationalist avlio seeks to
back out of an Imperial combination which he
entered against his Avill for the simple reason
that he was hanged Avhen he tried to stay out.
The Coining Race.
When the figures of the United States census
are published, it will be interesting to note hovv
much further the world lias progressed towards
that inevitable period Avhen the negro and the
Chinaman shall scramble Avith each other for
the ownership of the earth. The United States
is practically the only country where the pro-
gress of the Ethiopian can be traced Avith any-
thing approaching to certainly, and there the
results are eminently disquieting. Twenty
years ago the coloured ingredient formed one-
eighth of the population ; ten years ago they
had increased to oue-seA'enth ; to-day they
probably number at least one-sixth. The white
race has depended partly on its own natural
increase, and greatly on the enormous reinforce-
ments which pour in without ceasing from
Europe. The African population has received
no outside assistance, and yet hy its own
amazing fertility alone it is fast getting on a
level with its Aryan competitors. If emigration
had not existed, and the two nations had been
left to settle the question of supremacy on an
equitable basis, the African would probably be
already in front; as it is, the result is only
postponed, and unless the expansion of the sable
tribes can be checked by some violent means,
less than half a century will see them upper-
most. All over the world the inferior races are
beginning to crowd their more civilised neigh-
bours in an ominous manner. In Europe itself
the superior races are in a bad way. Each
decade shows that the relative increase of
the British population is smaller than it was
the decade before. Soon there will be no in-
crease at all, and then a process of decrease and
deterioration will immediately ensue. France
has already reached this turning point and
started on the downward road. Where the
Slav and the German exist side by side, as in
Austria, the Slav is rapidly elbowing the Ger-
man out. He is the more ignorant and the
more unwashed of the two ; his instincts are
coarser, and his aversion to knowledge and clean
shirts is strongly marked, and his value to the
world at large has, so far, been a minus quantity;
but with the unaccountable contrariness of his
kind his capacity for increase is indefinite and
almost illimitable. The Pole, amid the most
disadvantageous surroundings, keeps on multi-
plying joyously. Despite the poetry that has
been wasted on this notion of down-trodden
heroes the Poles are remarkable chiefly for the
fact that one man in a thousand or so is a
patriot of a noble type, and the other nine hun-
dred and ninety-nine are illiterate louts of hog-
like tendencies and unspeakable stupidity ; but
the mere fact that the alphabet and the bath
are of no use to Poland seems to keep its
vitality alive. And the Russian, apparently
because lie is several shades dirtier and more
ignorant even than the Pole, breaks all previous
European records in the matter of fertility,
while the negro and the incurable Chinaman
head the list. Apparently there is a good time
coining for the inferior races of this planet. The
Latin nations are obviously long past their
prime, and the Teutons are beginning to be
overshadowed. The European has kept his
supremacy hitherto by slavery and wholesale
massacre ; but slavery has gone out of fashion
(partly because machinery has proved itself a
cheaper institution) and the growing refinement
of civilisation, rather than of Christianity, has
created a prejudice against massacre because it
makes a hideous mess on the floor. American
statesmen, who fear that the United (States may
become another Hayti, are already dreaming of
a gigantic project for exporting the African
back to his native continent, but then the ex-
portation of ten million human beings is a
ponderous undertaking, and moreover the
European Powers which now own Africa would
probably put in their veto. As for the Slav and
the Chinaman no one even dreams of exporting
them, and in any case there is no place to ex-
port them to. And so the problem remains un-
solved, and in another half century or so it
will probably commence to solve itself.
“ The Best Governor New South Wales
Ever Had.”
Those of the New South Wales snobility who
so enthusiastically describe Lord Carington to
his face as “the best Governor New South
Wales ever had,” are solely to blame for the
open institution of invidious comparisons. Will
it be regarded as blasphemous if The Bulletin
ventures to suggest that Sir Richard Bourke
will very probably be regarded by history as
the best Governor which any of the Australian
ever had up to the present time? The Bul-
letin is quite alive to the many good social
qualities of his present Excellency, who, had
be been born untitled and in a less opulent
sphere of life than that to which it has pleased
the Almighty to call him, would have made a
faultless M.C. at a seaside-picnic, or a most
diplomatic shop-walker, or the very affable
manager of a suburban branch-bank. Lord
Carington has been a social success exactly
as, on a somewhat more limited scale, a
very large number of other people who
hold money and office are social successes;
but he hasn’t been an official success, for on the
only occasion in his vice-regal career in which
he was called upon to exercise a purely inde-
pendent and kingly judgment on a momentous
question he emphatically proved himself to be
hopelessly destitute of the feelings and percep-
tions which alone can fit a man to sway a
sceptre by proxy. And as Lord Carington,
unlike his almost immediate predecessor, Sir
Hercules Robinson, has never publicly said
anything worth remembering, or on any occa-
sion found brains for the nation, he will be
remembered chiefly, if not solely, in fifty years
by his decision in the case of the miserables
whom he sent to death in defiance of the right
of every citizen to a fair and unimpassioned
trial according to the letter and spirit of British
law. What have avc to remember in Lord
Carington’s reign? Some dances, some openings
of bottles and bazaars, and a senseless and
hideous massacre.
The Press “ Ring.”
The time has now arrived for mentioning that
the “deplorable conflict” between Toryism and
Trades-Unionism is maintained at fever-heat by
a drivelling daily press. Were it not for the
persistent publication of lurid Strike yarns and
inflammatory paragraphs, of statements that
one side is standing firm and the other will not
yield an inch, and, above all. of irritating sug-
gestions from the ass who signs himself “Pro
Bono Publico”—were it not for such incentives
to madness, the trouble would long ere this
have narrowed down to vanishing point. Tim
Employers’ Union, a pretentious group of inter-
ested shipowners and short-sighted hangers-on,
owes its miserable existence to the newspapers,
Avhieh are likewise responsible for that accursed
“precautionary” legislation represented by
Norden fcldt guns, untamed troopers, and

special-batoned bourgeoisie. Melbourne would
not have experienced a gas-famine but for
the shrill scream of journalistic terror at
the prospect of “ a city in darkness,” whereupon
450 stokers were prematurely called out, only to
find their services gradually replaced and the
Trades Hall railed upon by the great unthink-
ing public. The small, original spark of discord
■was fanned into a flame by newspapers, and as
the conflagration spreads “our special re-
porter ” works away at his stupid bellows and
enlarges upon the deplorable results of his
windy efforts. Each published “ interview ”
tends to make bad blood on both sides, each
sensational cross-heading produces further mis-
understanding. The fact that the daily liars,
one and all, hold more or less barefaced briefs
for the handful of fighting employers, is doubt-
less at the bottom of the mischief. Capitalists,
who in their calmer moments would acknow-
ledge that Unionism must go on and prosper,
allow themselves to be persuaded to the con-
trary by the ravings of their newspaper
counsel. ‘ ‘ An Abundance of Free Labour,
printed in large, triumphant type, encourages
them to forget that the “ free ” labourer of to-
day is the Unionist of to-morrow, and that any
trifling concession from the Trades Halls must
always be paid back to them with interest in
the near future. The real point at issue is
hidden from sight behind a cloud of mutual
threats and warnings suggested firstly by the
industrious pens of copy-mongers, and subse-
quently adopted by excited readers. A ring
has been formed by the press, and the com-
batants are exhorted to fight the matter out to
a finish, on 11 le sham assumption that Labour
has arrived at its full maturity, instead of being
a growing boy whose destiny is to win the belt
and wear it for all time. Fortunately, news-
papers are already beginning to suffer from a
dearth of advertisements. The storm they
have created is injuring their crops of profit.
There is some hope then that editors will see
the advisability of boycotting the strike, and
agree to ignore the fact that “Employers arc
firmer than ever,” and so forth. With no
cross-headings to encourage them, nor “latest
intelligence,” to keep the game alive, employers
and employed would soon silently shake hands,
and the course of the inevitable proceed as
usual.
The just-divorced Parson Gardiner, to whom
The Bulletin hereby awards the champion
belt for chilled-steel cheek, calmly explains in a
letter to the Sydney daily press, that the New
South Wales Presbytery’s real reason for casting
him out of the ministry, was not so much their
sense of the enormity of his offence in seducing
(or, as he appears to hint, being seduced by) a
Sunday-school teacher of his own church, but
their fear of what the public and the other
churches might say were he retained as a
preacher of the gospel. This, when you think
over it, is rough on the Presbytery and the
other churches, inasmuch as it means, if it
means anything at all, that Brother Gardiner,
having been behind the scenes, claims to be in
a position to declare that clerical morality in
general, and Presbyterian clerical morality
in particular, is all gammon. The good
shepherd goes on to say that he is “ daily
receiving from good men and women in all sec-
tions of his church letters expressive of the
warmest sympathy, and indignation at the
cruelty and injustice of the Presbytery. ’ \\ Inch,
being interpreted, must be taken to signify that
quite a number of Presbyterian ladies regard
clerical immorality with a tolerant and even
kindlv eye. Asa preacher the good pastor is
understood to have been a success, but in diplo-
macy as applied to adultery he has been a rank
failure, and as a newspaper-correspondent he is
a dismal fraud. Our adn a: to him is to return
at once to San Francisco. hen the Mormons
hear that a man of such liberal ideas has arrived
at the Golden Gate, they will lay on a special
express train to yank him to Salt Lake.
It would appear that a Sydney police-magis-
trate lias officially intimated that should any
cases of violent assault, arising out of the present
labour disputes, be brought before him, he
and his fellow stipendiaries will consider
the advisableness of using the lash. The
especial brutality of this immoral form of
punishment at a time of general popular excite-
ment is too obvious to need pointing out to any
but the privileged classes. The Bulletin has
ever contended that the lash is an instrument
designed for the especial benefit of the work-
man, and that no little heap of broadcloth duds
was ever seen stacked beside British triangles.
That contention here receives a forcible illus-
tration. To apply the cat to the back of a
brawling trades-unionist, as a trades-unionist,
will be merely to invite the most terrible re-
prisals on the part of the great democratic
organisation now so firmly banded together.
And here let us ask people to consider how it
has come to pass in a so-called free country that
at the mere word of a couple of bumptious
“beaks” a citizen may be flayed off-hand by the
common hangman ? Does not the deputing of
such a power to two in every way inferior
officers imply that trial by jury is no longer one
of the rights of Australian men ?
The poor, stupid Australasian, by some mys-
terious decree of Providence, has been permitted
to escape off the chain and publish this grotesque
effusion !
The writer of a letter to the Argus, apropos to boycot-
ting and the strike, draws attention to the following
remarkable extracts from the Book of Revelation:—
“ And they worshipped the beast, saying, Who is like
unto the beast? Who is able to make war with him?
And there was given unto him a mouth speaking great
thiiio-s. . . . . . . And he oauseth all, both small
and “great, rich and poor, free and bond, to receive a
mark: f hat no man might buy or sell
save he that had the mark or the name of the beast or the
number of the name. And the number of the beast is six
hundred three-score and six.”
Now, is it more than a mere coincidence that this
mystic number is exactly made up by the numerical
letters in the words “Trades Hall Union League of the
South”?
The meaning of the text is so simple that there'
is absolutely no excuse for this glaring ignor-
ance. The beast is distinctly the Australa-
sian, and the figures 666 were a prophetic
intimation that the price of it would be six-
pence, and that there were sixty-six columns of
excellent reading matter and illustrations in
last week’s Bulletin. Also, they contain a
hint that the proprietor of the Arhus wants to
make 666 per shent. The allegory of the seven
vials is probably a hidden intimation that the
Northern Yahoo might burst some day and
pay seven shillings in the pound. Ancient
prophecy is very interesting when it is read
intelligently. If Job’s comforters and the
twelve Apostles be added together and multi-
plied by the two tables of the law, you can even
hud an eloquent foreshadowing of the amount
of strike-pay distributed weekly among the
members of the Trades Unions.
Walter Besant, the celebrated English
novelist, moralises in his last published story on
the condition and prospects of the British
agriculturist:
In these latter days it hath pleased Providence in its
wisdom to afflict the British farmer with bad seasons and
low prices, and the prospect of worse to follow ; where-
fore, perhaps, he will soon become a creature of the
past, and the broad acres of England and Ireland will be
turned into pheasant preserves and forest-land for the
red deer, let at fabulous prices to millionaires from the
United States. As for the rustics, all except one in fifty
will migrate to the towns, where they will seek for work
and find none, and then there will be riots and risings
with murders and robbery. What will happen after that
I do not know except that there will certainly be no
recruits left for the British army ; so that unless—as
seems possible—other nations may be similar and
similarly affected, our nation will probably go under, and
be no more heard of except in history ; and someone will
write “Britannia fuit” on a gigantic slab, with
“Suicided in Defence of Freetrade” also done into
Latin, and stick up the legend on the cliff at Dover for all
the world to read.
Dear Bulletin,- —What are the West Austra-
lian people thinking about ? Now that they
have secured the right of Self-Government are
they going to allow the colony to remain under
the'rule of the Lee-Steeres, Leakes, Forrests,
and other disinterested patriots ? It looks very
like it, for as much interest is taken in the
forthcoming elections under the new Constitu-
tion as if they were being held for the return of
a school-board. Will the provinces ever be free,
if this lethargy in public affairs continues ? The
real hard work is yet to be done. The battle of
Reform has to be tackled. In the new Consti-
tution Act only the bare principle of Respon-
sible Government has been affirmed. The
property-qualification for members has to be
removed, triennial Parliaments adopted, the
new Electoral Act radically amended, or
abolished, and, above all, manhood suffrage in-
troduced. Not until then will W.A. emerge
from its cloud of depression, and shake off those
political leeches —to wit, the “ six families
who hold all the fat billets in the Civil Service
and are dragging the colony down deeper and
deeper into the mire. Up, rouse, then, ye men
of W.A., and smite the Philistines on their
hinder parts. The thin end of the wedge has
been inserted ; the power is in the hands of the
people, the way is clear, and the object is noble !
Why do ye hesitate ?—Yours, Perth. Sep-

While the daily press is bitterly opposing the

are giving a-sixth of their wages in aid of their

Hall and brazenly walking in tlie labour-proces-
sions. This is just as true as that the policemen
heartily sympathise with Labour.
Probably the most pathetic incident since
the war occurred in Oakland the other night. It
seems that in a big boarding-house over there was
an old maid of the nervous variety, that is always
looking under the bed, before retiring, for legen-
dary “man.” Being aware of this peculiarity,
some of the male boarders, who were “ whooping”
it up one night, concocted a dreadful practical
joke. They stole a life-sized wooden Dutchman
from the front of a cigar-stand, smuggled it into
the house, and secreted it under the chaste coueu
of the mature Diana referred to. When the hitter
retired, the conspirators waited on the staircase,
expecting an earthquake as soon as the bogus
burglar was sighted. They waited until the gas
went out without develop i ents. Was it possible
their victim had neglected her time-honoured cus-
tom? The idea was preposterous. They still
waited for the volcano to begin throwing up
screams, convulsions, melted lava and hair-pins.
Another hour passed by. At last the well-known

up, with its head on the old maid’s off pillow,
while with one thin arm over its manly redwood
chest, and one wrinkled cheek pressed against its
irresponsive shoulder, its companion slept the con-
tented sleep of one who had reached bed-rock at
last. She was making believe, poor thing.—S. F.

The committee of the South Melbourne Football
Club held a humorous “ enquiry,” with closed doors, into
the alleged cronk performance of Sowth against Carlton,
and were “unanimously of opinion that neither the team,
nor any member of it, was influenced by monetary or
any corrupt consideration.” The childlike faith of the
committee should be comforting to a certain staunch
backer of the Sowth, who smote his breast and swore that
he was “ well sold” on the day previous to the
match. What he “knew” others professed to be equally
well aware of, by the way. Even the name of the man
who was alleged to have squared the gallant champions
(or some of them) was heard in blasphemous whispers
before the game commenced. And yet when a body of
Sowth “barraokers” subsequently used threatening
language to this wrongly or rightly suspected party, the
press chose to attribute the row to an altogether outside
cause. The whole business smells like a dead cow.

Although the three-years-olds of this season are

A Melbourne sporting paper has recklessly
decided to “chuck away” £250 among those readers who
tip the five winners of Caulfield Guineas and Cup, Mari-
byrnong Plate, V.R.C. Derby, and Melbourne Cup at one
pop. There can be no possible infringement of any Lot-
tery Act in offering a prize under such conditions. The
element of chance doesn’t enter into the matter. The
odds are illimitable—millions to nothing—that the news-
paper can’t lose its stake.
The faithful horse, regarded as an investment,
is one of the most precarious animals on earth. Some
time ago a New Zealand sport bought an expensive
yearling, out of Florence M'Carthy, and just as he began
to congratulate himself on the prospective value of the
animal, his purchase fell over a precipice and broke its
neck. Then he bought the next yearling out of the same
mare, and this costly animal turned a sciimrsault in the
paddock and broke "its back. After this the speculator
grew tired, and concluded that the particular family of
horses in question was too much given to calisthenics to
be profitable, so he looked on while his particular enemy
purchased the next colt which came into the market, and
smiled a cynical smile as he thought of the consequences.
Only the third animal did not break its neck, and last
season it started in eleven races and won them all, and
now every time he sees it the maddened speculator opens
his mouth wide, and lets his impressions explode.

Little Bernie, at fist. 81bs. for the Melbourne

Melbourne metallicians on strike refuse to open

Bushman will be getting himself disliked by the
o-eneral public by whom he was backed, down to evens,
for the Randwick Steeple. He fell, like every horse in the

The boat-race between Matterson, who is said
to be in wonderful form at present, and Neilsen, for £2OO
a side, on the Parramatta, from Uhr’s Point to the
Brothers, was won easily by Matterson, who rowed the
little Dane to a standstill at Tennyson. Matterson is un-
doubtedly the best of the second-raters, and thinks of
having another turn with M‘Lean. Chris, was so spun
out that he turned green, stopped rowing, and had to be
assisted ashore.

An efficient appliance to facilitate swimming
seems to have been namely, swimming-boots.
The boots consist of canvr* tops and wooden soles, at-
tached to which are two blades of mahogany wood (some
are made of steel), which close with the forward motion
of the legs and open with the backward strokes. The
surface-measurements of the two blades on each shoe is
about 144 square inches, while the total weight of a single
complete shoe is about three pounds.

The Californian Athletic Club, we read, has
had in view for some time the giving of a boxing contest,
which would involve a test case, and settle for ever the
point at issue between the club and the police, but the
directors are either lethargic or apprehensive of evil, and
the affair seems to hang Are.

The match with the Players at Manchester—
variously reported, in two dailies, as with Lancashire and
All England terminated in a draw very much in favour
of Australia, which scored 234 and 186 for four wickets
while the professionals put together 176 only. In the
match immediately preceding, with the South of England
at Hastings, Australia was drubbed by ten wickets.

Megaphone has found a worthy owner in Mr,
Donald Wallace, who acquired him last week for £3ooo—a
pretty price to pay for a horse which has fully shown its
foot, and has practically no engagements. Of his scratch-
ing for the Metrop. the least said the better, as he only
had to weigh out to win, and not entered for the Mel-
bourne Cup, the fourteen pounds penalty could have had
no terrors tor his late owner. Megaphone has not changed
hands a day too soon to save him from crippledom. On
the third day of the A.J.O. meeting, after being beaten by
Carbine in the Craven Plate by a length, after a ding-
donger, in the wonderful time of 2min. Tsec. for the mile
and a-quarter, the colt was weighed out with 9st. 51b. on
his hack for the Sydney Handicap. How long would he
have lasted at that rate of going ?

The initial glove-contest of the recently-formed
Australian Athletic Club, between James Fogarty and
Charles Dunn, came off on Monday night at the Club
rooms, the late Darlinghurst Skating Rink. When they
last met Fogarty broke Dunn’s jaw—a fact which the
latter had not forgotten, as all through the first round he
sidled round with his left shoulder humped up for protec-
tive purposes. Fogarty was not to be denied, however,
and in the second round he got home on “ the point,” and
the subsequent proceedings did not interest Mr. Dunn for
several minutes. Fogarty, though not the most courage-
ous boxer in the world, is very dangerous, as he only
needs to get home once fairly, be it in the first or the
twentieth round, to achieve a knock-out, for no one neat
his weight can withstand his right-handers.

This little circumstance took out Seymours line

“ Dandy Dick ” is running to a crusher on
the flat, the grand-stand, and on the Olympian
Hill nightly, and is likely to stay the Criterion
course till wanted for the Melbourne Cup. Per-
haps the most perfect impersonation in an almost
faultless performance is Blore, and “Jimmy”
Cathcart might have been poured for this occasion
into the carefully-brushed garments of the
unctuous, hypocritical old butler. The Rev. Jedd
of George Anson is a very fine performance of a
character totally different from that of the
ecclesiastic he handled so charmingly in “The
Squire, ” and one that in almost any other hands
would have become a mere piece of buffoonery.
Robt. Brough, as Noah Topping, a stupid, stolid
village policeman with red hair, wooden features,
a lovely dialect and an enormous idea of his own
importance, has made a big hit. As the sporting
widow, Georgie Tid, Mrs. Brough is right out of
her usual line of business, but gives another proof
of her versatility by rattling through the part with
great vigour and spontaneity. By the way, when
she advises her nieces at the close of the first act
to put their petticoats on Dandy Dick, why does
she proceed to make entries in her betting-book ?
It suggests the taking of an inventory of their
under-linen—never the booking of wagers. As
Hannah Topping, late cook at the Deanery
and the “profligate woife” of the bumptious
bobby, Annie Taylor is in her element,
and scores heavily in a small part, but “Ted”
Corlesse is scarcely suited as Sir Tristram Mardon.
As the lugubrious Hussar, Tarver, with a faulty
liver and a tonsilitic top C, Frank Cates for
once gets right away from himself, and as his
fatuous, fiddling fellow-officer, Darbey, Cecil
Ward is all right. The lack of lightness which
pervades the Salome of Florence Harcourt is com-
pensated for by the lady’s personal charms, and
Lilian Seceombe was specially constructed to
pourtray the artless, ingenuous damsel of the toy-
child Sheba order. As Hatoham the groom,
Owen Harris is well-garbed, bright, and satis-
factory.

Had the opening performances of ‘ ‘ Boc-
caccio ” at Sydney Royal been equal in finish to
the later ones, the management might not have
found it necessary to sandwich four nights of
“ Paul Jones,” with Syd. Deane in the name part,
between it and “ Chilperic,” a Druidical yarn sea-
soned with Herve’s (not Hervey, nor yet Hervery)
musical sauce, that has not been played in Sydney
for a good many years. The company will doubt-
less have got “ Chilperic ” down very fine by the
time it is wanted for Melbourne Cup season.

The bottom having fallen suddenly out of
“Macbeth,” that stout, puffy, and deliberate
person with the three Cockney witches, and all
the bats, goblins, and other fearful wildfowl that
fly about ’mong coloured fires and steam-pipe
vapours, will be withdrawn on Saturday from Her
Majesty’s for “The New Magdalen,” in which Janet
Achuroh will play Mercy Merrick, Charles Char-
rington—who, like Irving, is game to tackle any-
thing—will make an unprovoked assault on Julian
Grey, and Herbert Flemming will do his best, which
doesn’t seem to be as good as of yore, with Horace
Holmoroft. After a six nights’ run, Magdalen
will give way to “The Long Strike,” a Bouci-
caltian drama last played in Melbourne some
years ago, in which William Rignold will double
as Noah Learoyd the leader of the striker-’ and
Moneypenny the lawyer.

The Charrington season terminates at Her

Alice Norton, a soubrette, G. P. Carey, A. Rolfe,

Fortnightly changes of bill, and, to some
extent, of company, enable Harry Rickards to fill

folks weep with delight. “ The Whistling Wife,”
sung by Katie and Harry Rickards and Fred.
Davys, gives the gallery that opportunity of
chiming in so dear to their unconventional and

Considering the number of times that “ As

England, it is a wonder that the piece is not

to some enterprising manager.

Take off your hat and bow your head ;
Of Irish boys the lightest-hearted
Will laugh no more —the Shaughraun’s fled
To join the ranks of friends departed ;
But though the actor’s voice be dumb
The author’s pen leaves many a token
To stir men’s hearts, longtime to come,
Where’er his mother-tongue is spoken.
We scoff, or curse, or merely yawn
At stupid, modem stage “sensation” —
Whilst thirty-years-old “ Colleen Bawn ”
Is still a theme for admiration.
Take off your hat, or even weep,
Remembrance of his laches smother,
And green his laurels only keep—
The Shaughraun’s dead, there lives no other.
* * * *
Now that cantankerous, clever, lavish old
Dion Boucicault is buried, along with his domestic
scandals, the man’s wonderful faculty for turning
out a couple of good melodramas to each indifferent
one produced by his nearest rivals, will be more
generally admitted. Of all successful playwrights
Boucicault has received least praise from the Press
in proportion to the merit of his work. “ Stolen
from the French” was a stereotyped sneer at his
plots, uttered by critics who forgot that he was
the real original father of the existing style of
Irish drama, also the first and best maker of
“sensation” upon our stage. He introduced
Derbies, boat - races, railway - trains, conflagra-
tions, music-hall scenes, slave-sales, and a
dozen other effects, regarded as startling
novelties at the time to English theatre-
goers. But round and about those vulgar
motives Boucicault sketched characters and filed
in dialogue which have given a long life to many
of his plays. The once-admired thrillers of H. F.
Byron and Watts-Phillips w r ere born and passed
almost out of recollection while those of grand old
man Boucicault have remained in strong favour.
Within the last three months no less than four of
his plays—“ Kerry,” “Flying-Scud,” “ Formosa,”
and “ After Dark ” —have been produced in Mel-
bourne or Sydney. At least eight of them have
bobbed up serenely during the year, and will cer-
tainly continue to bob up for the remainder of
this century. Some, if not all, of the credit for
“ London Assurance ” is due to Boucicault, and
his adaptations of “ Corsican Brothel’s ” and
‘ 1 Louis XI. ” are already regarded as staged assies.
But for his luxurious tastes and greed of
money to spend (by which he was induced to
regard plays as merchandise rather than as works
of art, and turn them out in the smallest possible
space of time) there can be no question that the
gifted Irishman might have left an even bigger
name. Judging him by his actual works, nor
forgetting that he was in his minor capacity of
actor unapproachable in one line of character, we
are bound to consider him the brightest fellow
identified with English drama during the Y.R.
I’eign. By the way, the cable gives his age as 08,
but the present writer’s father was at school with
Dionysius Lardner Bossancour, at Wyke House,
Brentford, in 1835, at which time the budding
“Boucicault” (rumoured to be Bishop Lai'dner’s
son) was at least Ifi years old. The writer’s pro-
genitor loved to allege that he played leading
female to D. L. Bossancour s vigorous rendering
of Rollo, at the scholastic private theatricals, but
the writer, while accepting Rollo as a great fact,
always stuck at the rest of the yarn.

All the Melbourne theatres struggled over
last Saturday night without a change of pro-
gramme, in order that three of four of them might
engage in a furious jostle of fresh attractions one
week later. There is even less sense and more
cussedness in managers than in most of their plays,
and their system of fighting for “first night”
money, instead of grabbing at it in turn, is
harassing to the general public, and ought to be
squelched under the Riot Act. Why Hubert
O’Grady didn’t run up “Crimes of Paris,” or
“Hamlet,” or anything in place of “Famine’' at
the Royal is a maddening mystery. Sinking
deeper every week into a slough of in-
telligent contempt, the Royal cannot be
hoisted back to a solid basis by O’Grady,
who dwindles away the more you look
at him, until nothing but a bag of chestnuts re-
mains. Gods assemble in fair quantities, but the
rest of the theatre being mostly empty, the youth-
ful football barracker will soon weary of finding
nobody to spit upon, and then the new star (who
comes from the English provinces and not from
America, it seems) will have to waste those Irish-
Ethiopian “ bulls ” which bored his ancestors in
days of old upon valuable space. Until “Famine”
gets shifted the exact cause and reason of Mr.
O’Grady is still hidden from view.
* -* -» *
“ School ” competes with comic-opera for
the smiles of fashion, and the Bijou (closed on
Monday night on account of the Boucicault
bereavement) continues to do big business all over
the house. “ Dorothy ” flourishes at the Prin-
cess’s until Saturday, when “ Mikado,” with
Maggie Moore as Katisha, is to take its place.
The company has lost charm, somehow —although
baritone Ryley improves on acquaintance—and
Maggie Moore arrives in the nick of time to pre-
vent a gradual decay of public interest setting in.
* * * *
“ Fun on the Bristol ” has just about
squeezed the last sixpence out of its long-suffering
supporters, and now an enterprising management
proposes to dig little Eva from her last resting
place, and resuscitate the venerable nigger and
the bloodhounds and the comic lawyer and all the
other trials appertaining to “Uncle Tom’s Cabin.”
Everybody is bulging out with disgust for Uncle
Tom by this time, and as an entertainment for
people suffering from the strike he is neither
more or less than a coloured insult in several acts.
At the Alexandra, Bland Holt intends
planking down the strongest card in his hand next
Saturday. “London Day by Day” is a title
evidently intended to cover an extended range of
plot and about twenty changes of scene. Rumour
speaks of this as a large production, and the whole
strength of the company is in training for the
event. Meantime, “Union Jack” puts in a
couple of performances.

Santley, Armes Beaumont, Mrs. Palmer,
and Madame Christian have conspired together to
give the last-named lady a eomplimentary concert
at Melbourne Town Hall on Saturday. The
chance of hearing all four artists in good voice

claims of Madame C. upon a large and soulful
musical constituency.
At Poverty Point.
The phases of Boucicault’s career began with a period
wherein he mainly tried to work off comedies, such as
“ London Assurance,” “Old Heads and Young Hearts,”
and “ The School for Scheming.” The next stamp of his
work was in conveying from the French such splendid
pieces as “ Louis XL,” “ Faust” and “Marguerite,” and
the “Corsican Brothers.” In America he wrote the
“ Octoroon” and “ Colleen Bavvn,” then in London again
he developed the sensational, with “After Dark,” “For-
mosa,” “Flying Scud,” and that genus, but the best
things are his Irish plays—the best of them, “ Arrah-na-
Pogue.” He wrote nigh 400 plays, his unfailing fountain
being the French, from whence came even “The Octo-
roon.” Some think he must have been older than 19
when his “London Assurance” succeeded so brilliantly at
Covent Garden, with Farren, Mathews, Madame Vestris,
and Mrs. Nisbett. He touched off this glorious period
charmingly in the North American Review last year.
Churchill Otton, who financed the Victorian Orchestra
trip to Adelaide, dropped £2OO over the venture, and says
he has decided not to take Madame Patey to the sacred
and alleged musical city in consequence.
Toole says that when Irving visits Sydney he will be
announced thusly : “On this occasion ‘Hamlet,’ by the
gentleman who gave Toole the snuffbox.”
G. V. Wood, one of the leading Adelaide singers, has
left that city for Sydney to teach music. He has a fine
bass voice, and much impressed Santley.
The Adrian to Mary Provost’s Camille of thirty years
ago is frequently to be seen on the Sydney Block, in the
person of Joe Raynor, now in a green old age.
R. S. Smyth waxes sarcastic. Alluding to Santley’s
announcement that he was not assisting at Best’s final
organ recital in Sydney, the Much Travelled says:—
“ Before leaving Melbourne I had arranged that, in the
event of Mr. Best consenting to have any vocal assistance,
it should be in the form of an attractive novelty !”
“Johnny” Solomon’s luck is right out. Landlord
Asche, of the Royal, has got an injunction which prevents
him shouting, ringing a bell, or playing on any musical
instrument in his auctioneering temple, which adjoins the
hotel.
Garner is getting up a matinee benefit to Eloise Juno on
a liberal scale, at Melbourne Princess’. She is a good
Queen, in “Hamlet,” but hasn’t seen too much of the
buried Majesty of Denmark lately—otherwise ghost.
Dr. Neild has a portrait in oils of Ellen Mortyn, a
splendid actress who made a Melbourne sensation 30 years
ago. The portrait belonged to G. V. Brooke. Miss
Mortyn, a Dublin grass widow, was a great success as
Hester Grazehrook, in “ The Unequal Match,” and Sylvia
in the “Two Gentlemen of Verona. She died.rather
mysteriously, but it was all cleared up by a post-mortem.
The French operatic baritone, Mons. O. Deslouis, who
came to Australia seeking health and has found it, will
sing “ Les Rameaux,” and an aria by Kowalski, next
Saturday afternoon with the Sydney Centennial Orchestra.
Musgrave, the actor who played the rich alderman so
well in the Potter-Bellew revival of “David Garrick,” is
in Melbourne Hospital suffering from a throat-complaint.
It is said that George Coppin intends to make another
bid for the possession of Melbourne Royal.
The theatrical and musical halls ‘ 1 hands ” of London have
formed a trades-union. So have the employes at the

At the conclusion of Jacques 42-days’ fast at West-
minster Aquarium he carried Mesmerist Kennedy, a 14-
stone man, on his back round the stage, and on the
receipt of a gold medal which styled him the champion
fasting man of the world, offered to bet £lOOO that he
could prolong his fast by 10 days. What next ?
It is said that David Christie Murray takes the St. Maur
Company to England there to produce his plays,
“Chums” and “ Gratitude,” while he makes his debut as
an actor to London audiences.
While Janet Achuroh was doing the sleep-walking
scene in “Macbeth” the other evening, a little black cat
trotted on from the prompt side, smelt her robe, and
walked off O.P. A similar incident happened to Louise
Pomeroy in the same scene in Melbourne.
Emma Wangenheim’s trip northward had to be aban-
doned on account of the strikes.
Julie and Bose Albu, soprani of Continental training,
are coming to Australia from S. Africa, where they have
made a name for themselves.
Mary Anderson was worth, it is said, £lOO,OOO, made on
the stage and by speculation, when she married her
Navarro.
It is said that Pattie Browne is going to London under
engagement to Toole, after all.
Sims’big hit was “The Lights of London.” Let him
now produce “The Liver of a Londoner.”
David Christie Murray’s four-act comedy-drama,
“ Gratitude,” did not create a sensation in New Zealand.
The Gaiety Co. arrive in March next. They open at
Melbourne Princess’ with “Faust up to Date,” “ Ruy

The burlesque actress, Fay Templeton, has returned to

an American paper, “ is the daintiest possible compromise

A seceded section from the Hicks combination, banded
together as Brian Darley’s Dramatic Company, were play-
ing “ Lost in London ” at Brisbane Opera House recently
when, such a vigorous demonstration was made against
one of their number, F. W. Montague, that the curtain
was dropped. At this stage Austen Eliot came forward
(with managerial sanction) and said: “I have a few words
to say. (Cries of order.) I wish to know whether you
will let the play be proceeded with or not. There is
evidently somebody in the play to whom you have some
objection. I want to know’ if all the other members of
the company are to suffer on account of that one ? (A
voice: ‘ Chuck him out.’) We can’t chuck him out, be-
cause it would interfere with the play; besides I don’t
know who it is you are talking about. I w’ant to know if
you will let the'play proceed? (Cries of ‘No,’ ‘Proceed,’
and uproar.) I want a little reason, please. If anyone is
taken out of the cast to-night the play can’t go on. and
the innocent must suffer with the guilty. (Cheers.) lam
playing for my living, not for fun. (Cheers.) I want to
know what you require. (Muffled cries of ‘ Chuck him
out.’) Will you or will you not consider people who are
earning their living, who, I certainly should say, are not
those who are causing this disturbance. (Cheers.) I
myself am here trying to earn my living, as some others
are doing, but because someone here has offended you,
are we all to suffer for the sake of that one person ?
(Cheers, and a voice, ‘ Promise to dismiss him to-morrow.’)
We will dismiss him to-morrow. (Cheers.) Whoever you
are alluding to, we will dismiss him to-morrow.” (Loud
cheers.) The lady then withdrew, and the play was
allowed to proceed with only occasional interruption, on
Alfred Woods, her hubby doubling “ Blinker ” and
“ Featherstone.” Montague got himself disliked through
making two trips as providore on the Burwah “ to oblige
Howard Smith & G 0.,” to whom he was under a debt of
gratitude. Now he’s gone, the unionists promise their

A third cablegram has come to hand concerning the
movements of Emily Fitzroy, who is not an Australian

we learn that she has made a successful debut, presumably
at the latter theatre. Who pays for those cables ? The

The commander of the German warships

the services of his marines and so on, to help

A Melbourne man has just paid £ll5 10s.
for a ten-guinea book. On Sept. 12th, before the
Chief Justice, Mr. Justice Webb and Mr. Justice
Hodges, constituting a Full Court, an appeal in
the case of the Picturesque Atlas Publishing
Company against C. C. Bentley, of Little Collins-
street, manufacturer, was heard in the Full
Court. The appeal was the outcome of an
action brought by the Picturesque Atlas Company
against Bentley in June last to recover the amount
due for the “Picturesque Atlas of Australasia.”
The defence raised by the defendant was that the
plaintiff company had broken the contract by not
delivering the work according to promise. The
Full Court held that the tender of the work was
sufficient, and that it did not matter when the
actual delivery took place, and found in the plain-
tiff company’s favour, with costs. Great interest
was evinced in this case, as it was looked upon by
many as a test one. The costs awarded the
company amount to about £lO5.
Suppose Treasurer Mac Million had left the
N.S.W. Ministry, his resignation would have
been followed by that of several other Ministers.
Then Parkes would have resigned. Then Gover-
nor Carington would have sent for Dibbs, and
Dibbs, if not altogether a born idiot and utterly
incapable of learning from experience, would have
scornfully refused the offer and left the pure-
merino-Foreign-trade party to stew in its own
gravy. Then the Mac Million would have formed
a Ministry and gone to the country, and would
have secured, you may safely bet, a very poor
majority, if a majority at all; and when the
House met, old man Parkes would have been care-
fully sitting on the Ministerial cross-benches, and
at the very first fair chance on which he could
“ conscientiously ” help Dibbs to slaughter the
Calico Jimmies he would joyfully have waded in.
Meanwhile the labour party would have become a
great block-vote power in the land, and old man
Parkes would have commenced to think about a
Coalition.

I’he third source of great wealth is manufactur-
ing on a large scale. In this case the owner or
borrower of capital plunders his employes, ,vbo
sell him their daily labour. The difference be-
tween the actual value of this daily labour, as
expressed in the price of the articles it produces
and the wages paid for it, forms the profit of the
manufacturer, allowing, of course, for raw material
and other running expenses. In most cases this
difference is out of all proportion and usuriously
exorbitant compared with the wages. It is
often spoken of as the reward of the manu-
facturer’s mental exertions. But the reply
can be made to this assertion that the mental
labour required to manage the technical and mer-
cantile interests of a large factory, bears no com-
parison to that necessary in scientific investigations
or literary productions, and at the highest can only
be ranked with that required in a public office or
the executorship of an estate. And yet the results
of the mental exertions of these latter are by no
means so remunerative as the annual income of
the great manufacturer. The profits of manufac-
turers cannot be looked upon as mere interest on
the capital employed, because no manufacturer is
content to sell his goods at a price which would
bring him in a net income of four to six per cent.,
after all the expenses and the pay for his
mental exertion had been deducted. This per
cent, is obtainable by anyone on invest-
ments without risk, even ‘by the man of
leisure. The price at which the manufacturer
sells his goods is regulated on the one hand by the
amount of competition with other manufacturers
with which he has to contend, and on the other
hand, by the larger or smaller supply of labour.
His first care is to pay his employes as little as
possible, his next to sell to the purchaser as dearly
as possible. When the supply of labourers allows
him to hire labour at the lowest prices, and the
absence of competition or other circumstances
make it possible for him to sell his manufactured
articles at a very high price, he does not entertain
the idea of limiting his income to six or ten per
cent., but he bends all his energies to making a
hundred or even more per cent, on the capital em-
ployed. 1 lie advocates of this plundering of
labour by Capital say that the division of this net
income of the factory between the capitalist and
the labourer would only keep the former poor
while raising the wages of the latter so slightly as
to be immaterial, amounting to merely a few
pennies a day, divided among so many. A noble
a modest argument, forsooth ! It is possible that
the wages-receiver might receive only a few
pennies more a day, if he were able to retain for
himself all the fruits of his daily labour. But by
what right is he obliged to present his employer
with even the tiniest share of his daily earning's
when the employer has already the interest on his’
capital and a sufficient remuneration for his
problematical mental labour ? Let us imagine for
a moment that every inhabitant of the German
Empire were forced by law to pay a penny every
year to some Smith or Meyer, not in return for
any services performed, not in gratitude for any
benefit he might have rendered to the community,
but as a simple present. The favoured individual
would thus be ensured a yearly income of about a
bundled thousand dollars \ but none of the con-
tributors would feel the loss of their penny. One
penny 1 that is such a small amount that it is not
worth the trouble of speaking about it. And yet
such a law would elicit from the entire nation a
cry of indignation, and every citizen would revolt
against its arbitrary injustice. But the economic
law which obliges the poorest part of the nation,
the factory employes, to present this same Smith,
or Meyer, a contribution of not one cent., but of
ten to fifteen dollars in the lowest cases, and often
of from one to five hundred dollars, in the course
of the year, this law seems to be quite a matter of
course to those who happen to be exempt from its
jurisdiction. The injustice is about the same in
both cases. But the world at large appreciates
but slightly or not at all the injustice perpetrated
upon the proletaire, because it has continued for
so many centuries, because mankind has become
accustomed to it by habit, and also because it has
not yet assumed that paradoxical form in which a
truth must reveal itself before it can fore* 1 ' an
entrance into unreceptive minds.
* *• #
We have thus seen that great wealth in almost
all eases is due to the appropriation of the results
of others labour, not one’s own. 13y their own
labour alone men are only able to support life from
day to day, occasionally to lay by sufficient for
times of sickness and old age, rarely 1 1 attain to
regular prosperity. Some physicians, lawyers,
authors, painters, and other artists have been able
to turn their personal efforts to such advantage as
to obtain annual incomes of hundreds of thousands
of dollars, and thus accumulate fortunes of
millions, without resorting to speculation or ille-
gitimate profits. But such persons are rare, num-
bering probably but two hundred or even one
hundred living at one time throughout the
civilised world. And even their wealth, examined
closer, has something of a parasitic character,
with the sole exception of that amassed by the
author. In his case, if he becomes a millionaire
it is owing to the fact that lie has written a book
of which one or two million copies have been sold,
wing that his wealth is the direct remuneration
0 ~,.1 S intellectual labour, paid him voluntarily and
willingly by mankind ingeneral. But when an artist
sells a painting for 100,000 dollars, a surgeon
performs an operation for which he receives
$lO,OOO, a lawyer receives the same sum as his re-
taining fee, or a prima donna is paid $5OOO for one
evening’s performance, these amounts do not re-
present the price paid by the mass of people as the
legitimate and voluntarily-proffered reward for
individual exertion. They are the mathematical
demonstration of the fact that a small number of
millionaires are living in the civilised world, with
no means of judging of the real value of any work
because their riches are not the result of their own
labour ; who satisfy every one of their whims with-
out regard to its cost, and fight among tin niselv.w
for the possession of certain things, a painting for
instance, or the song of a certain prinia donna,
the service of this physician or lawyer and of none
other-willing to pay any price to satisfy their
caprice. Aside from the rare instances of success
m the pursuit of the liberal professions above
described, the rule is without exception that a
great fortune necessarily owes its origin and
growth to the plundering of one’s fellowmen.
When the real estate inherited by a certain man
increases in value, it is not the result of his own
exertions but of the fact that the number of work-
ing-men torn from the land and soil is constantly
increasing, that all forms of industry are growing
in extent, that the cities are becoming more and
more populous, that the labour of civilised society
is being confined more and more to manufacturing
industries, thuscausing the prieeof provisions to rise
m the same proportion as the price of manufactured
articles is falling—in short, because other men are
working, not because the landed proprietor exerts
Himself. \\ hen the speculator amasses millions it
is by the abuse of a superior strength, either
°t luiormatiou, sagacity or of combination,
with which he deprives the labouring and saving
classes of their property, as the brigand relieves
the wayfarer of his purse, first knocking him down
v ith his club. When the manufacturer becomes a
wroesus, it is by systematic plundering of his
workmen, who receive for their exertions in his
behalf nothing more than food and shelter, like so
many domestic animals, and both the very scan-
tiest possible. The entire results of their labours
How into the money-bags of their master.
It is in this sense that
we must construe Proud-
hon’s exaggerated and
therefore false assertion
that property is theft.
We can only make it seem
true by placing ourselves
upon the sophistical
standpoint that every-
thing that exists is created
for itself, and from the
fact of its existence de-
duces the right to belong
to. itself. According to
this idea we are stealing
when we pick a blade of
grass,_ when we inhale
the air, or catch a fish.
The swallow is stealing
when it eats a fly, the
worm when it eats its
way into the heart of the
tree; all nature is peopled
by arch-thieves, every-
thing that has life is
constantly stealing, tak-
ing materials that do not
belong to it, eating, in-
haling, and making them
part of its organism in
any and every way. The
only instance of absolute
freedom from stealing
on this mundane sphere,
according to this view,
would be abarof platinum
which takes nothing from
other objects, not even
oxygen from the air to
form rust on its surface.
No, property is not theft
when it arises from
trade—that is, from the
exchange of a certain
measure of labour for a
corresponding measure of
goods. But an enor-
mous capital, that is the
accumulation of vast
amounts of property in
the hands of one man,
such as no individual
would be able to amass
as the results of his own
la,bour, even at its very
highest valuation—such
fortunes are due to the
robbery of the labouring
classes.
This band of robbery
for whom the whole com-
munity toils, is power-
fully organised. It has, in
the first place, the mak-
ing and administration of
the laws in its own
hands, as it has had for
centuries. At every new
law promulgated, we
might exclaim with Moliere : “ Yous etes orfevre,
Monsieur Josse !” “You are a capitalist, Mr-
Lawmaker, or at least, you hope to become such,
and declare everything to be a crime that might
injure you in the pursuit, enjoyment and posses-
sion of your capital. ” Everything that a man can
get hold of in any way by open, hand to hand
violence is and remains his own. And even when
the genealogy of a property can be traced to literal
robbery or theft (such as conquest, seizure of
church property or political confiscation of others’
goods) this crime becomes an unimpeachable title
to possession, if the owner has been able to hold
the property for a certain number of years. The
State law that calls out'the police, is not sufficient
for the millionaire. He makes superstition his
ally and gets from Religion an extra padlock for
his money-chest, by smuggling into the catechism
a sentence which asserts that property is sacred,
and envy and covetousness for our neighbour’s
property, a sin to be punished with the fires of
hell. He distorts even the laws of morality and
furthers his selfish aims by inculcating upon the
vast majority of the people, toiling for him, that
labour is virtue, and that man was only created to
labour as much as possible. How comes it that
the best and truest intellects have believed in the
reality of this fiction for thousands of years?
Labour a virtue? According to what law of
nature? No living being in the organic world
works for the pleasure of working, but only for the
purpose of self and race preservation, and only so
much as is necessary for this twofold purpose.
People say that organs only remain sound
and develope when exercised, and that they
wither when they lie idle. The advocates of
this system of capitalists’ morality who have
found this argument in physiology, do not mention
the fact that organs are much more rapidly de-
stroyed by over-work than by work. Rest, com-
fortable leisure, is infinitely more natural, pleasant
and desirable, for man as well as for all other
animals, than work and exertion. The latter is
only a painful necessity, required for the preserva-
tion of life. The inventor of the story of the
Garden of Eden in the Bible, showed that he ap-
preciated this fact with honest naivete, by placing
his first human beings in a paradise where they
could live without any necessity for exertion, and
labour, the sweat of man’s brow, was the terrible
punishment for their disobedience. Natural, zoo-
logical morality proclaims that rest is the highest
reward of labour’, and that only so much work is
desirable and commendable as is indispensable to
prolong life. But the robber band do not accept
this idea of the case. Their interests demand
that the masses should work more than is neces-
sary for them to support life amd should produce
more than is required for their own consumption
so that their masters can take possession of this
overproduction for their own use. Consequently
they have suppressed the morality of nature and
invented another, which they set their philosophers
to tabulating, their parsons to praising and their
poets to singing. According to their system, idle-
nesses the beginning of all crimes and labour a
virtue, the most excellent of all virtues.
* # *
The robber band is, however, constantly contra-
dicting itself with the most short-sighted policy.
The robbers carefully avoid even the pretence of
submitting to their own code of morality, and
thus betray the small amount of respect they
have for it in reality. Idleness is only a
crime in the poor man. In the rich man it is
“ FEATURES OF THE STRIKE.”
A LABOUR REPRESENTATIVE.
an attribute of a higher type of humanity,
the token of his exalted rank. And labour,
which his double-faced morality asserts to be a
virtue for the poor man, is from his point of view,
a disgrace and a sign of social inferiority. The
millionaire pats the labouring man on the shoulder,
but excludes him from his social intercourse.
Society, which has accepted and adopted the
morality and views of the band of capitalists,
glorifies labour in its most choice terms, but at the
same time, assigns the labourer to the lowest rank.
Society kisses the gloved hand and spits on the
horny hand of the son of toil. It looks upon the
millionaire as a demi-god, upon the day labourer
as an outcast. Why ? For two reasons. Firstly,
because the prejudices and ideas imbibed in the
Middle Ages have been perpetuated to the present
time, and secondly because manual labour in our
civilisation is synonymous with lack of education,
* * #
During the Middle Ages idleness' was the pre-
rogative of the nobility, that is, of the higher race
of conquerors; labour, the compulsory performance
of tasks by the people, that is, by the lower race
of conquered and subjugated beings. Conse-
quently the man that laboured betrayed the fact
that he was a son of the race which had given
proof on the field of battle that it had less virile
manhood and strength, while the lord, the man of
leisure, receiving his means of livelihood from his
estate or by conquest, looked down upon the work-
ing-man with the contempt of a white man for a
Bushman or Papuan, which is founded on the
appreciation of his anthropological superiority.
To-day leisure and labour have ceased to be tokens
of race. The millionaires are no longer the des-
cendants of the conquering tribe, the p>'oletaircs
are no longer the sons of the subjugated people.
But in this as in so many other cases, the historical
prejudice has survived the conditions under which
it originated. The rich man still considers !„•,
employe, who works for him and supplies him
with his luxury, merely as a kind of domestic
animal, as the nobleman centuries ago, looked on
his vassal, neither of them recognising in him a
complete human being, their equal in any way
* # #
Manual labour is also synonymous with a lack
of education in our civilisation. In fact the whole
organisation of society renders cultivation inac
cessible to those without means. The son of a poor
man can hardly go for long to the public school
much less to high school and college, being obliged
to earn money as soon as anyone can be found to
employ his services. We can admire in this case
another example of the conformity to the end in
view of the present conditions of State and society,
ihe expensive institutions of learning are sun
Ported by the State, that is, by the tax payers
working-men as well as millionaires, but they only
benefit those who at least possess sufficient income
to live till their eighteenth or twenty-third year
without supporting themselves. The factory
employe who cannot let his own son enjoy the
benefits of a higher education, because he is too
poor to afford it, is yet constrained to have the
son of the rich man study at his expense, when he
pays the taxes which are applied to the mainten-
ance of the intermediate and high schools. The
English and Americans are still consistent up to a
certain point. Their higher educational institu-
tions, even if they are not accessible to rich and
poor alike, are yet no burden, upon the community,
because they are either maintained by private
enterprise or by endowments. But on the con
tinent of Europe, in conformity to the prevailing
policy of plundering the people for the purpose of
benefiting a small minority, the institutions for
higher education are supported from the Budget
that is, from the amount of taxes paid to the
State by the nation, although their benefits
are only enjoyed by a privileged few, by
no means even one per cent, of the total
population. And who are the chosen few
for whom the State supports colleges and tech-
nical schools requiring appropriations amounting
to millions? Are they the more capable young
men of their generation? Does the State take
pains to admit to their lecture-rooms only those
persons in whose minds the instruction imparted
by the professors will surely bring forth fruit?
Does it refuse to allow blockheads to usurp the
place and opportunities for learning intended for
receptive and creative intelligent faculties? No.
The State offers these higher branches of learning
not to all but to a few, and these few are not
chosen for their special intellectual endowments
and capacity for assimilating this higher culture,
but for their financial conditions. The most
dense-headed simpleton can go through college
and absorb the mental food spread before him by
the professors, without it ever proving of the
slightest benefit to the community, if he has
money enough to support himself and pay his
tuition fees. The most talented young man on
the contrary, is excluded from the halls of learning
because lie lacks these necessary means—a matter
of real detriment to the community which may
lose by it some Goethe, Kant or Bacon.
* * «
Thus the pernicious conditions of society and
political economy in our civilisation, form a civ-
cuius vitioms from which there is no escape-
the labouring man is looked down upon because
he has no cultivation; he cannot educate
himself because education and cultivation cost
money, which he has not got. The rich retain for
themselves to the exclusion of the poor, not only
all the material enjoyments of life, but the in-
tellectual as well. The noblest blessings that
civilisation has to offer us, culture, poetry and art,
are, as a fact, only free to the rich, and cultivation
in its most comprehensive sense, is the most im-
portant and most exclusive of all their privileges.
When some young man of the lower classes suc-
ceeds in mastering the higher branches of educa-
tion by means of almost superhuman exertions,
by deprivations and humiliations, begging, if need
be, and receives a diploma in the university, he
never returns to the position of his father. Free
from the prejudices and ideas of society, which
consider a man who obtains his livelihood by
manual labour as a being of the lowest social
status, he could take up the trade of his father
and show the world one example of a day-labourer
standing upon the same scale of culture as the ink-
flourishing public functionary and the recluse
professor. But he does not do this, he strengthens
these prejudices by enrolling himself as a member
of the privileged class, by affecting to look upon
manual labour as degrading, and by getting his
support, like the other members of the upper
classes, from the labouring people. There are
many kinds of manual labour by which a skilled
mechanic or artisan can earn without extra effort
a good living, while preserving his independence;
on the other hand, nine-tenths of the situations
in the business-houses, railroads, and in the civil
service, only pay very limited salaries. And yet
the college graduate prefers one of the latter posi-
tions by far, even with its accompanying office
slavery, to the better income with liberty. As a
government employe he belongs to a privileged
class in society, to the exclusive brotherhood of
cultured Philistinism, but as a working-man, he
would stand outside of the castes with whom
society affiliates, and be looked upon as a
barbarian who did not breathe the same mental
atmosphere as the cultivated set. These circum-
stances would be all changed if the collegiate
graduate would take his place at the lathe and the
man with the leather apron be reading Horace at
his nooning, and the blacksmith or shoemaker,
with their diplomas in their pockets, after the
day’s work is finished with the anvil and last, sit
round an aesthetic five o’clock tea-table and dis-
course as learnedly as some young lawyer or clerk
in chancery. For honest labour is honourable
and dignified, whether it is applied to making
overcoats or planning the constructions of rail-
roads, and their mental culture being equal, the
civil engineer has no more claims to respect and
consideration than the tailor. But the college
graduate does nothing to bring about such a con-
dition of affairs. He prefers to starve in his
shabby-genteel overcoat rather than Jive in com-
parative plenty, wearing a leather apron. This is
the cause of one of the most threatening phases of
the social problem : the over-supply of men in the
liberal professions,

. Writing in the last Contemporary Review,
Sir 0. Gavan Duffy draws on Marcus Clarke’s
graphic description of the Eureka riots. Clarke
studied them analytically, for those dashing

about two-thirds of the novel, as published three

The Archduchess Valerie of Austria lately
renounced all her right, title and interest in the
Austrian throne, in order that she might marry
the man of her choice, and a very large quantity
of pathos has been evolved in consequence.
Valerie’s chance of the Austrian throne was just
a shade better than Battenberg’s prospect of
becoming King of England, and as the husband
of her choice is worth several millions, she will be
let down easy from her imperial elevation.
Tennyson got badly crushed by a wealthy
snob once when sitting in the travellers’ room of a
hotel, while two alleged gentlemen were dining at
the other end, sedulously waited on by an atten-
dant. As the man came from the dining-table
and passed the poet, he (Tennyson) asked “How
far from here to ?” No answer. He repeated
the question, whereupon one of the diners arose
and said, in a very imposing manner, “Be good
enough to address your observations to the domes-
tics of the establishment. This is a private ser-
vant. ”
William Furlonge, an old political and
pastoral identity, has died at Dtibbo, N.S.W.,
aged nearly 80. A generation ago he was as well-
known as Jimmy Tyson is now. The holder of
vast possessions as a pastoralist he was killed by
droughts. It is recorded of him that when he sold
his pastoral property in Victoria, with the inten-
tion of migrating to N.S.W., he was a member of
the Assembly in the former colony, and, on resign-
ing his seat, went round the' Chamber and,
having shaken in farewell the hand of every
member present, stood at the Bar, made a pathetic
little speech and bowed himself out.
Lord Jersey, according to his published
photograph, is a gentleman whose forehead flies
violently backwards from his eyebrows, as if
making a bee-line for the hinder extremity of his
head, while his chin retreats almost straight into
his chest. He has mutton-chop whiskers, and
wears his hajr flat, and there is a sad, surprised
look in his eye, as if he had just been presented
with a bag of guano and didn’t know where to
put it. It is further reported that “ his delicate
skin seems hardly able to maintain its pristine
harmony against the buffetings of England’s cruel
climate,” which seems a delicate way of saying
that his hide is out of tune.
Jenkin Coles, Speaker of S. A. Assembly,
spent his earlier years as a policeman. He is the
only policeman who ever rose to greatness—unless
we can count in that energetic special constable,
Napoleon 111. ; and many a time, as he sits in his
chair of state, his thoughts go back to the time
when he left his hoof-prints on his weary beat,
and ordered the loafer to move on, and clubbed
the stentorian drunk, and hunted for pie in souk;
cookey’s pleasant bowers, or else made love to the
housemaid over the back fence. It was a pleasant,
happy, unreflectiveera for Shenkin, and the world
was younger then, and politics did not rage so
vociferously ; and probably the brawny cop of the
past was a great deal happier than the Speaker is
to-day.
POLITICAL POINTS
John Haynes says that Protection is as
dead as Julius Caesar in Sydney. So, John, are
Foreign-trade and the Pope, also King Billy.
Duffy has an excellent paper, the first in
the August Contemporary Review, on Australian
Responsible Government. It is thoroughly Radi-
cal, as Duffy goes, and does justice to Lalor and
the Eureka.
Judging from Mr. Crick’s utterances in
the N.S.W. Assembly, in re the threat to flog
violent strikers, it would appear that he is dis-
posed to let his bias as a lawyer sit on the chest
of his alleged democracy.
The significance of the Brazilian Revolu-
tion is displayed Ipy the elections this week, for
there are only a-quarter of a million voters in a
fifteen-million population, wherefore the Republic
is affirmed by the middle class, not by the
“ rabble.”
Mr. Trenwith, M.P., dislikes “ free ”
labourers. Speaking of the recent hooting done
by the N.S.W. Volunteer Artillery, he said :
“The citizen soldiers the pthqr day showed what
they thought of the scum of the earth, the semir-
ings of the gaols—free labourers.”
A SENSIBLE OBJECTION.

When Treasurer M‘Millan intimated to the
Sydney Exchange deputation that his Government
was determined to take drastic measures with re-
gard to all strike disturbances, the wink passed
round that there was an arrangement for the land-
ing of blue-jackets from the British war-ships in
harbour.
The permutations, not to say tergiversa-
tions, of a Melbourne daily on the Strike have
been marked. First support, then opposition,
then support again. It is said to be traceable to a
row with the Kapelle Yater and his myrmidons.
The proprietary was persuaded not to be influ-
enced foolishly by private affairs.
Dr. Bowker, M.L.C., traces the present
strike to “ the absence of the Bible from the public
schools.” How many well-educated men go to
church or accept the Scriptures as inspired ? How
many well-educated medical men admit they see
any reason to believe in an after-life ?—as the
I tal ian proverb says: ‘ ‘ Three doctors, two infidels. ”
And yet —how few doctors go on strike. I
One of the uses of the recently-erected
barricades at Circular Quay, Sydney, is to facili-
tate the landing of Imperial marines and blue-
jackets. Any such foreign invasion of our country
will be simply an invitation to begin sewing at (if
not actually to complete and hoist) the Australian
Republican flag. The Bulletin is glad in this
connection to see that the Nordenfeldt and
cavalry party are cheering for Queen Victoria at
every possible and impossible opportunity.
At the“coming N.S.W. general election the
Trades-hall and not the bogus “National” Club
will be the head-quarters of the great Democratic
party which has sprung into existence in, as it
were, a single night. The leaders will not neces-
sarily select working-men candidates, but will
give such of the present members as are not
outrageously at variance with the labour-cause
opportunity of declaring their opinions concern-
ing the Radical platform to be submitted.
Minister Brunker (an ex-butcher) who is
far too big for his boots, picked up a hot penny in
he N.S. Wales Assembly last week. Walker,
M.L.A., was speaking and Brunker interrupted
him with, “You have no more principle than a
dog in a butcher’s shop.” “ You ought to know,”
retorted Walker like lightning, “for you are a dog
who is known to have been in a butcher’s shop.”
Brunker afterwards said he was “ sorry to have
—aw —noticed so insignificant a member.” We
once heard a man say something like that after
he had been fooling with our pet bull-pup.
The Bulletin does not for an instant
believe that Bruce Smith ever said he would like
to shoot down the strikers “like b y dogs”—
or _ anything of the sort. As a barrister, the
Minister has learnt to keep his temper, and he is
a man singularly and notoriously unaddicted to
bad language. When the public are asked to
believe that a calm and phenomenally-level-headed
business-man, whilst member of a Government,
confided so emphatic and startling a desire to a
parliamentary opponent, they are asked to believe
too much. The phrase smells of Bourke rather
than of the Works Office.
Hutchinson, the godly M.L.A. for Canter-
bury (N.S.W.), who has lately been divorced by a
wife he married in 1876, now calmly explains in
public that he is living with the old wife again and
“ does not recognise ” the new one. However, the
wicked Judge Windeyer, of the cruel Supreme
Court in its matrimonial jurisdiction, recognises
her and also her claims to two pounds a week out
of Mr. Hutchinson’s Parliamentary stipend.
Hutchinson’s “explanation” in the N.S.W.
Assembly, the other evening, on this point elicited
roars of laughter. The lamb-like unconsciousness
of the holy man that he had done anything not
absolutely square, or that he was not deserving of
a halo while still on this sinful earth was too much
for the assembled politicians.
Sympathy.
Sympathy is one of the noblest and most
characteristic of the human passions. Who has
not heard the expression, “It makes rny heart
bleed to hear a recital of that woman’s wrongs or
this man’s sufferings?” Sympathy is a natural
outcome of a pure, good and benevolent spirit, it
is an offering which the most lowly can pay to the
tribulations of their suffering fellow beings, which
the most exalted and wealthy can bestow on their
equals and peers in the life of this nether world.
A most wonderful sympathetic influence exists
between the human brain and all parts of the
physical being, all the nerves centre in the brain,
and no part of the physical organism can be
affected or disorganised without immediate know-
ledge being carried to the brain—the centre of the
spiritual being—immediately, not the finest point
of the finest needle can be applied to any part of
the body without the brain immediately becoming
cognisant of the fact, so perfect and wonderful is
the telegraph-like connection of every part of the
body with the brain. The nerves cover the entire
surface and ramify into every point of the
structure; a disordered liver or stomach causes
headache, rheumatism makes pain appear at the
affected part, so does neuralagia, toothache, &0.,
the pain is only felt in the brain though the
sensation appears to be in the part that is affected,
this is because sensations are only experienced at
the extremities of the sensory nerves, and by a
wonderful provision of nature enables us to locate
the position of any unnatural condition of any
organ or function. Wherever there is pain there
is a chance of disease, and one cannot be too care-
ful in giving immediate attention to such matters.
A vigorous treatment should commence with
Clements Tonic, this remedy will cause all mem-
bers of the body to resume their natural work ; it
will assist digestion, assimilation, secretion and
excretion, will restore sound and vigorous action
to all organs and tissues; this is proved in the
many cases which have been treated with this
wonderful remedy.
Mr. W. J. Markes, a gentleman well known on
the Hawkesbury, writes : “‘Dear Sir, —It is with
feelings of great pleasure that I pen these few
lines. I have been a sufferer from General
Debility and Indigestion for the last five (5) years,
and have tried almost every known remedy with-
out the slightest benefit. I had given up all hopes
of being cured, when by good luck I saw Clements
Tonic advertised in the Windsor Gazette. I
determined to try it, and after the third dose the
change was remarkable. I took three bottles,
and now feel like a new man altogether. I am a
hawker, and in my travels I shall recommend it
to all that I see.”
And Mr. E. Smilt, another well-known gentle-
man in the same locality, says : “ Sir, —I am very
pleased to say that I have taken two bottles of
Clements Wonderful Tonic, with the most desir-
able and astonishing effect. I have been a long
sufferer from loss of blood and weakness, but
after taking your medicine the change in me is
remarkable. I think it is a boon to the suffering
community. ”
When such evidence as this is vouchsafed over
the signatures of reliable and well-known men, it
proves beyond doubt the positive efficacy of
Clements Tonic. Hundreds of such endorsements
can be had on application to Clements Tonic

Apropos of Mrs. Bonanza Mackay’s recent
action for libel against a paper which said she
used to wash for her living, a Yankee journalist
alludes to her as “ the mother-in-law of a Colonna
trembling at the shadow of a washboard,” and
says that “ in the estimation of a reflective being
the story of the wash-tub would add as much to
the interest attaching to Mrs. Mackay’s per-
sonality as that which Andrew Carnegie gains
from the story of his entering Pittsburg on foot
with a loaf of bread under each arm.”

The callow critic had just been introduced
to the Beautiful Actress by the Soulful Masher
who makes love to her on the stage and is loved by
her off. The S.M. discreetly withdrew, and the
8.A., holding the O.C.’s inky paw in her burning
palm, looked straight in his blood-shot optics and
murmured ; “ You do not love me! ’ Then, while
the embarrassed C.C. strove to say that he adored
the woman though duty compelled him to criticise
the actress, she blurted out as if impulsively, “ Oh,
no you don’t, or you’d never say such things about
me; but you won’t do it again, will you ?” Then,
just as the C.C. was beginning to think he’d made
a mash, the S.M. returned, heralded by a loud
cough and a stage-stumble, and tire dream of love
was o’er. Henceforth, however, the C.C. gave her
gushing notices and hung round the stage-door at
the close of performances to press her little hand
and whisper ecstatically : “How are you?” The
B.A. knows her way about.

Sydney Exchange authorities are taking’ up
a collection on behalf of two troopers, one of
whom fell from his horse and was hurt and the
other of whom was struck by a piece of blue-metal
last Friday. It is to be hoped Premier Parkes
will give to these constables handsome compensa-
tion from the Treasury for any injuries they have
sustained, and at the same time disallow their
acceptance of money given by a political clique.
By the way, if the members of Sydney Exchange
only h?ard what the police say in confidence to the
present writer, they would think twice before
getting up any subscription—except possibly in
the way of a bribe.

There is at least one Sydney special con-

He is a member of committee of his trades-union,

who coolly told him that the time spent on duty
could be made up by working overtime without

“ Jack ” Want’s Sunday Bill submitted to
the N.S.W. Legislative Assembly has evoked a
protest from the Council of the Sydney churches,
containing eight reasons for opposition. In two
of these reasons the churches give themselves away
badly. (6.) “ Because if we don’t take a firm
stand now, we shall not have a chance again.”
(7.) “ Because we have been too sleepy in the past,
but have awakened at last.” No. 8 is a de-
lightful specimen of church humour : “ Because,
though we have many wants, Mr. Want’s Bill
meets no want of ours.” When the poor clergy-
man attempts to be funny he merely hires himself
out as a buffoon. Just imagine a big community
being ruled by a pack of people capable of pub-
lishing such samples of self-accusing imbecility !

Giammona, the almost celebrated flautist,
who arrived with De Murska, died last week in a
Sydney asylum, where he had long been confined.
His story was a tragic one. After De Murska
left, he taught music, and like many another
music-master, he made fiery love to his pupils.
Some clerks in the building wherein he gave
lessons used the auger. Giammona got to know
that they knew, then he went to the lunatic
asylum, and now he is dead.

Does Governor Carington, ere he leaves
N.S. Wales, propose to do anything in the way of
making amends for his hideous Mount Rennie
blunder? By the way, we hear that one of the
miserable young wretches now undergoing im-
prisonment for life, has by the death of both his
parents since his incarceration began, succeeded to
an income of £OOO a year. We mention this fact
in order that several benevolent politicians may
proceed to the rescue, likewise as a hint to
charitable members of the legal fraternity.
# # #
Mr. Hurley, M.L.A., of N.S. Wales,
is wrong when he says that the Americans
have “ too high an ideal of womanhood ”
to allow a woman to serve behind the bar.
The fact is that the Yankee likes fancy
drinks, and the mixing thereof involves an amount
of continuous and hurried physical labour of which
most women are incapable. In Australia, a man
and his friend walk into a bar, the barmaid puts
down before them a bottle and two glasses, they
help themselves to whisky-and-water, and when
she has received a shilling the transaction is com-
plete. In America not one man out of twenty
takes a plain drink. The preparation of drinks is
there a fine art, and the bar-tender is as deft as an
apothecary. The Yankee barman, who handles
perhaps seven ingredients in making a single
drink, is a big swell, gets high pay, and works
like a flash of lightning.
# # *
The character of barmaids is largely
dependent on the character of their employers.
A low public-house will probably contain low
women, just as a Sunday-school presided over by
a giddy clergyman will contain giddy female
teachers. The barmaid in the respectable hotel is
almost invariably a level-headed woman whose
morals are far above those of the average servant,
or of the average restaurant-waitress. The bar-
maid gets at least £1 (and often £2) weekly with
board and lodging; the restaurant-waitress, who
works at least 12 hours daily and is not allowed
lodgings, gets 12s. to 15s. What sort of life can a
girl live on 155., and how many of the employers
spare time to enquire about the domestic relations
of their day-servants? If the latter work well,
they are regarded as respectable; if they don’t,
they are sent away. And there is an end of the
matter.

Last Saturday a respectably-attired woman,
carrying a reticule, entered the Woolloomooloo
police-station, Sydney, with, “I want to be locked
up. I know very well what .will happen if you
don’t put me in. ” The officer declined. “It wor
quoite agin the reggilations.” An hour afterwards
LOVE AND RESPECT.
HE: "SO YOU REALLY THOUGHT, BEFORE WE MET, OF MARRYING
THAT OLD FELLOW?”
SHE: “YES YOU SEE HE WAS VERY FOND OF ME AND I RESPECTED
HIM-THOUGH I DIDN’T EXACTLY LOVE HIM.”
HE: “BUT YOU LOVED ME?”
SHE: “OH, YES; I DIDN’T RESPECT YOU”
she lay prostrate on the kerb at the Domain gate
opposite. “ Dhrunk is it ye are agin ?’’ exclaimed
Felix O’Flaherty as, raising the inebriate to per-
pendicularity, he shook her, and, dragging her
across the street, ran her in. This time she
vigorously protested against incarceration. The
laws of our civilisation are not designed for the
protection of people against themselves.

The Ex - Councillors, now languishing
through his little three-months’ sentence in Mel-
bourne gaol, turns out to have been such a whole-
sale robber and double-dyed impostor that there is
some talk of prosecuting him afresh. For six
long years he squandered the funds of
Rechabite Lodges in gambling speculations and
rum. When his safe was broken open the weep-
ing Rechabites found it loaded up with empty
bottles, corkscrews, and bills for liquor supplied,
while a few remaining securities were impregnated
with odours of ardent spirits to such an extent
that the committee of enquiry had to bo disim
fected before they dared return home. All of
which serves them right for allowing him to
open Lodges and snuffle temperance maxims when
all the while they knew in their hearts that the
miserable hypocrite was on the burst.

the casual assistance of Shakespeare and Verdi),
is about to quit the stage and retire to a farm.
The natural destiny of the modern tenor is a. farm,

acquiring virtuous habits. From time to time we
hear of Woodfield and Leumane relapsing into
rural pursuits and singing ballads to the old barn-
door rooster and the harvest-moon.

Sydney girls are unlikely to suffer much

The truncheon of the Sydney special con-
stable is a log of ironbark 14in. long, into which is
burnt something that looks like a crown. The
special constable’s truncheon is accepted as a sym-
bol of the most extreme respectability ; it is also
usually capable of being regarded as an intimation
that its holder, who ostentatiously shoves it up
his sleeve in the railway-carriage, lias never done
anything so vulgar as to sink a shaft or hump salt

has completely supplanted the lawn-tennis bat as
an outward and visible sign of “social position.”

For lack of turbulent masses to “ shoot
down ” or other congenial employment the Mel-
bourne army in barracks has resorted to the
extreme idiocy of christening a foal with cham-
pagne and holding athletic sports with Hopetoun
in the chair, to celebrate the birth of the little
charger. The Age, in an abjectly drivelling report
of those proceedings, mentions how Colonel Price,
of the Mounted Rifles, was ordered out of the
ring “by one of his subalterns” after having
failed to clear a hurdle, and how “ the Colonel
responded with the alacrity of one of his own full
privates.” This is apparently regarded as a strik-
ing instance of the Colonel’s devotion to the ser-
vice, or something. The whole business suggests
to The Bulletin the utter sinfulness of encourag-
ing amateur swashbucklers to play the fool in
Melbourne when they ought to be developing the
works of God up country.

By foolish friends who rave
The praises of the damsel young,
And laugh to hear her giving tongue,
Incite the critic knave
To think the wreath were better hung
Above the darling’s grave.
’Tis sad to see the snow-white rose
Before its beauty’s fled,
Adorn the bunch the dudelet throws
When grinning to his box ho goes,
At little Tottie’s head.
Upon her box it should repose,
When little Tottie’s dead.

The Melbourne police made a raid some

It has just been discovered than an old
law. dating from the year 1503, still remains in
foi’ee in Scotland whereby any woman against
whom a divorce is granted is condemned to imme-

find out whether any statute of this kind has been
accidentally transplanted to Australia. The grand
old Constitution is so desperately loose that no one

A dismantled skeleton and a little human
dust were recently found near Healesvillo (Vic.).
The head was gone, and the remainder of the
bones were dropping apart, but a pair of pants
were still decipherable, and in the pocket was a
bleached and weatherworn pawn-ticket. There is
something very enduring about the great Austra-
lian pawn-ticket. Probably, if Leichhardt’s grave
is ever found, the occupant will be recognised by
the presence of a faded document, setting forth
that some old dead Moses lent the great explorer

ago.

The Situation.
[BY AN UNATTACHED UNIONIST.)
We do not ask our masters to do other than is
right
And just;
But they must not eat rich viands and the wine
quaff while we bite
A crust!
We do not want to take from them the wealth
which they have earned ;
We do not want to take from them the knowledge
they have learned ;
We do not want their ships or mines or sheep o r
cattle-runs;
But we want a fairly good time for ourselves and
little ones;
And we’ll have it—come what must!
As far as mem’ry goes we have been ploughing up
the land
And sea,
Or cutting out the stone with powder-fuse or
hand,
To be
The steeples of great churches or high mansion-
walls ; or yet
Have been bearing bags upon our backs until eacl
sun has set;
Or been digging, digging, digging, with needle o r
with awl,
At some poor craft for the poor thing a wage our
masters call—
And we’re tired of such fee !
And why not ? Masters, one by one, or scores of
them, turn out
Each year
To trip it to old England or to trot the world
about;
While here
We, the toilers, who work hardest, cannot take a
fortnight’s rest,
Unless we pinch the mother and the baby at her
breast;
If sickness falls upon us we are forced to beg for
bread,
And if it treats us roughly we must coffin up our
dead
With money borrowed for the bier !
We say we do the hardest work, and why should
these things be ?
Say, why,
Though Labour’s curse is on our heads should
wives and children see
Nor sky,
Nor wooded green, nor ripple of the river, nor
surcease
Of weary, wearing dragging till their spirits find
release ?
Why should masters and their wives and kids sup
pleasures till they fill,
And workers and their wives and kids hug misery
until
They’re ordered off to die ?
No preaching or philosophy will ever answer that.
By rules
At present favoured by the conscience of the cult
of shovel-hat,
Or tools
Of ancient saws and apothegms which, being old,
are thought
To mean a lot of wisdom, but which really mean
nought;
If we work for the other world we’ll seek our pay-
ment there,
But for what we do for this world we must ask
our payment here ;
And we’ll force it—or we’re fools !
That’s our new rule. Your proverbs drop and
the total code of cant!
We stand
On the ground of human equity; and what to-day
we want,
The Land,
Meaning by that phrase the People—all the
workers, great and small,
Everyone who works for wages, man and wonnn,
child and all,
Boot to foot are standing with us—and we ll win,
if not now, soon,
Or the mansions and the steeples we have builded
will be strewn,
In the hour of wrath, in sand !
We do not wish extremities. We have the power
to be,
By might,
What we will to be. But rather we would wish
our masters see
The right.
We have suffered under tyrannies and rules of
bogus Law,
And when victors we want converts and not
cowards blanched by awe ;
We do not want our masters to go down upon
their knees,
But the sun sets, and we want them to give
audience to our pleas
Ere the darkness of the night!
In vino Jackass.

should know that on account of my husband I
can’t keep a domestic more than a month.”
Dear Bulletin, —Your “educated In-

which have more than fulfilled desired effect, it is

The Battle of Circular
Quay.
The other day a first-class scheme for raising a
row suddenly occurred to some genius in the mer-
cantile community of Sydney, and no sooner had
it been conceived than it was put into execution.
A lot of wool, union and non union alike, was
lying at Darling Harbour, and it was necessary to
have it carted to Circular Quay. There were
plenty of carters who would have undertaken the
job ; many of the large carrying-firms in Sydney,
such as Sanders and Horne, &0., were actually
going on with their business just as usual, in
spite of the strike. There was nothing whatever,
therefore, to prevent the wool being carted down
peaceably, as was the case with other goods all over
the city. Had any violence been apprehended, a
few mounted troopers could have assured absolute
safety to the men driving those carts. But it did
not suit the geniuses aforesaid that things should
be done in the ordinary way. They wanted to
show these striker fellows, begad, that they could
cart their own wool in defiance of them, under
their very eyes, begad ! So on Friday, 19th Sept.,
about 10 a.m., a crowd of wool-brokers, auctioneers,
squatters, bankers, lawyers, millionaires, and
so on, assembled in the city, and marched to'
Darling Harbour for the purpose of driving those
drays down to the Quay in spite of the infernal,
low, blackguardly strikers, don’t you know. They
made no secret of it, either. They simply courted
THE NEW BODY-GUARD.
GOV. HOPETOUN : “I’m vewy much obliged, but would sooner have lost half-
a-crown than that this should have occurred. I weally am not
fwightened and don’t want a body-guard, but if you will leave
your addwesses I'll telephone for you if the chimney catches fiah,
or something occurs. There may be some cold meat about if you
will step downstairs.”
a row; they let everyone know what they in-
tended doing. They, as it were, dragged their
coats through the streets and besought the strikers
to tread on them.
* # *
Well, they got their drays loaded up, and
then the extraordinary procession filed out
of the Darling Harbour yard. One dray was
driven by Mr. Halliday, a squatter of vast wealth,
especially antagonistic to the unionists; another
by a well-known Sydney attorney, the ad-
venturous “ Billy ” Cope, who has for years been
trying to get his neck broken, without success, in
various parts of the world : another by an
auctioneer, whose salary is £2OOO a year. Seated
beside the drivers (some of whom wore black
belltoppers and lemon-coloured gloves) on the
wool-bales were a job-lot of the special constables
who had been sworn in to preserve the peace. When
this wonderful cavalcade filed out of the gate a large
crowd of people had collected, and the ridiculous
spectacle of a lot of magnates, with white waist-
coats and big “ binjies,” driving wool-drays, made
them burst out into loud and derisive yells. The
special-constables made faces at the crowd,
swaggered about on the wool-bales, and one or two
ostentatiously displayed batons and revolvers.
Then one of the drivers,began “taking lunars”
with fingers outstretched from nose. These
things formed the turning-point. The ridi-
cule and the hooting gradually changed to
a fierce snarl of anger from thousands of excited
men. It was a sound that was not good to hear—
a sound that has rarely or ever been heard before
in Sydney. The unionists looked upon the whole
absurd show as a challenge and an insult, and
when the revolvers were shown blue metal began
to fly. It mint bo admitted that the sight of some
specials, very fat men with eye-glasses, belltopper
hats, and white spats over their boots dancing
about on top of a load of wool-bales offered an
almost irresistible temptation for a pot shot,
though it is to be regretted that the things thrown
at them were not a deal softer. Very little actual
harm was done by the vast crowd —two or three
men got cuts, none at all serious, nothing to what
the regular police get every day in the week from
the larrikins amongst whom their work chiefly
lies. As soon as the drays left the narrow streets
and got into the main thoroughfares, all stone-
throwing ceased, and a huge procession formed
behind the drays hooting vigorously.
* * *
When they arrived at the Quay the first dray drew
up against the wool-store and the unloading began
amidastormof hooting and chaff. “Why don’t they
take off their coats to it ?” yelled one man. “ ’Cos
they’ve got no shirts on,” shrieked another. Down
on the Quay there is luckily no blue-metal as the
streets are wood-paved, and one or two larrikins
who had thoughtfully brought some rocks along in
their pockets, and commenced to thi’ow in a feeble
way, were immediately sorted out by the regular
police and driven off to the lockup out of the very
centre of the huge crowd without the slightest
sign of resistance being made. The unloading of
the wool was proceeding amidst a great noise, but
without any attempt whatever at interference,
when suddenly, to every one’s astonishment, a
horse auctioneer appeared at one of the upper
windows of the store and began to read the Riot
Act. This very serious step, which means that all
fire-insurance policies in the city are made void for
24 hours, and which authorises bloodshed at once,
was taken when there was not the slightest occasion
for it. The drays were being unloaded as rapidly
as could possibly be wished : there was no stone-
throwing and no rioting of any sort. (It is stated
in the daily paper s that a trooper was pulled off his
horse. This is a gross mis-statement, for the fact it
that the horse fell down and the trooper was not
touched by any person.) When the horse-auctioneer
appeared at the window everyone expected him to
offer the teams, horses, wool, drivers, special con-
stables and all as a damaged lot, without the
slightest reserve, broken to saddle, side-saddle,
single and double harness, trial past the tram,
stand fire, water, or music, and carry a lady; but
when he began the Riot Act there was dead
silence—the silence of astonishment.
* * *
Then some more mounted troopers came
galloping down the street and were ordered
to disperse the people, and to show what
a fierce, bloodthirsty crowd these “rioters”
were, some twenty mounted troopers actually
drove several thousand people before them
like sheep and cleared the quay in no time.
The “ rioters ” got out of the road of the horses as
fast as they could, and there was not a sign
of resistance or animosity—save such as is
naturally engendered in a man when he is
being chased for no earthly reason by a
squadron of cavalry. The only redeeming
feature in the whole day’s pitiful display was
the way in which the mounted troopers, mostly
young bushmen, bred in the saddle, handled thair
horses. They rattled them about on the slippery
stone pavements, in and out among the carts, in
an absolutely reckless fashion. Two men actually
rode out on to a floating punt moored against the
quay, and rounded the “rioters” off it like they
would round sheep out of a paddock. The mounted
troopers are a body of which, as horsemen, this or
any country might well be proud; but nothing
else in the day’s show could cause anything but a
feeling of disgust and contempt. The drays, when
unloaded, were driven back to Darling Harbour
and left there, and the “specials” marched off
again amidst thousands of jeering unionists, and
tramped down to the Exchange, where they dis-
persed to drink long beers boast about what
they would have done if the rioters had only been
good enough to riot, and cheer for Queen Victoria.
Where she came into the question, Heaven only
knows. Thus ended the battle of Circular Quay.
# # #
The official and—we have every reason to believe
—the sincere attitude of the Labour Defence
Committee is one of complete abstention from
all violence. Ever since the commencement of
the world Might has been Right. It is quite
open for any set of men, who think that they can
take charge of the country and set up a (Jovern-
meut of their own, to do so; but such tasks are
never entered on save by fools, unless with a fair
chance of success. Physical violence is no good
unless it is intended to use it right up
to Revolution, and the workmen of Austra-
lia know that they are not now prepared
for a revolution, save, such a one as can be
brought about at the ballot-box. It is no use
to slap the face of the Government and then run
away. It is of no use to produce a revolver or a
brickbat with the intention of over aweing your
opponent, for you then merely license him to
shoot. The one thing which will surely be effected
by the present strike is the consolidation of an all
powerful democratic party which, despite the
efforts of the other side to obscure and direct
its attention from the real issue, will yet, we pre-
dict, bury in one common grave Ereetrade,
Protection, the Pope, King Billy, and every other
thing and person the discussion of which at
present divides the toilers’ vote and bars the road
to such legislation as w r ill ensure a vastly-increased
production and a more equal distribution of the
proceeds of labour.
A broth of a boy—Boycott.
A monstrous Belgian grievance is over the
monkeries and nunneries, there being about 20,000
celibates in such institutions, which Italy and
Spain have knocked on the head.
In America, way back some 40 or 50 years,
when specie was scarce, and produce, owing to
difficulties of transit, not easily disposed of, public
entertainers were often compelled to take out the
value of tickets in vegetables, corn, poultry, &c.
At that time the grandparents of an actor-family,
well known in the States, owned a floating theatre,
built upon a flat boat, which they navigated with
the current from town to town along the
Mississippi. The mother of the family sold tickets
and played heavy leads. She had an office in the
bow, with bins and compartments for receiving
merchandise, and directly over the head was a
sliding door, which opened into a chicken-
coop on the roof. One evening in the
year 1835 the theatre was tied to a stake
near the boat-landing at New Madrid. The play
was “ Othello,” and although times were hard and
money scarce, the audience was a good one, and
green corn, eggs, and chickens came in plentifully,
so that Emilia many times ere she could finish
dressing for her part had to come back, open the
trap-door, and push another fine fat pullet into
the coop. Between the acts Emilia and Brabantio
came out to reckon up the takings. There were
two dollars and ten cents in cash, about two dozen
water-melons, thirty or forty eggs, and a small
supply of sweet potatoes and green corn. “ There
must have been a big run on chickens to-night,”
said Brabantio, seeing how meagre the' receipts
were in other directions. “ There was,”
replied Emilia; “there are at least fifty in
the coop.” Brabantio rushed up on deck
to have a look at them. Lo, the coop was
empty ! The New Madridians had put off one
pullet on the old lady all the evening, employing
a barefooted little nigger boy to slip up over the
stern of the boat and steal the fowl out of the
coop as fast as she put it in, and when the whole
town had taken their seats the nigger stole the
chicken on his own account and went home to
supper. Brabantio was a good Methodist, and
spared a good deal of strong language which the
situation might have justified ; but just as the
curtain ran up on the fourth act the old man
slipped his cables, and the “Temple of Thespis”
and the play went on steadily together. Just
before the curtain fell on the last act he pushed
in shore and made fast, and that audience had tc
walk home ten miles through a swamp.— Era.

Writing from Gundy, Mr. William Grace says :
“ I received the watch safe sent to be repaired,
and it is now going as well as ever. I hawe had
it two years, and it always kept first-class time till
I overwound it. I have carried a watch for forty
years, and never found one to give me the satisfac-
tion of the Waterbury, although I have paid
twenty guineas for one.”
Mr. Arthur Taplin, Cobbitty, writes : “ I am
perfectly satisfied with the Waterbury watch I
have in my possession. I see a good many of the
watches, and it is the general opinion that they
are good, cheap watches.”
From Cowra, “E. A.” writes: “My watch
came safely to hand. It has given me great satis-
faction since I bought it, about two years ago.
Although it has had very rough usage, it has
proved a good timekeeper, and I feel confident
that now, after cleaning, it will be as good as
ever.”

OUR OWN INVESTIGATIONS
From the Daily Northern Telegraph.
Recent editorial comment by some of the most
influential papers in Great Britain, respecting the
value of an article which is extensively advertised,
has led us to make certain investigations on our
own behalf, in order that we might lay before our
readers facts which we had personally verified.
Advertisements are one thing, but voluntary
editorial endorsement of the value of an article is
quite another thing. This latter occurs so very
rarely that it becomes all the more important.
From the report below it will be observed that
we have confined our investigations wholly to
local people. The reports are from well-known
citizens, which must carry conviction to the minds
of every thinking man and woman.
Messrs. Jackson and Co., of 9, Regent’s build-
ings, top of Penny-street, being among our lead-
ing merchants, their opinion was first sought by
us. In answer to our inquiry Mr. Jackson states
that the article in question was one of the most
staple. Immense quantities were sold by him
every month, and the actual merit which it pos-
sessed was undoubtedly the cause of its being one
of the leading articles of trade in Blackburn. *
* * Among these oases which Mr. Jackson
related was that of a well-known society lady
(whose name we are not at liberty to publish),
who had been confined to her room for more than
three weeks by muscular rheumatism in the back,
during which time she was under the treatment of
one of our leading medical men ; but continued
from the first to grow worse. She was very much
prejudiced against advertised remedies, and al-
though repeatedly urged to try St. Jacobs oil she
persistently refused. Her sister, unbeknown to
her, procured a bottle of the oil from Messrs.
Jackson. The first application gave the lady
relief, and before the contents of one bottle was
used she was entirely free from pain. She felt so
grateful that she personally visited the store of
Messrs. Jackson, and told them the facts as above
narrated, and says that hereafter she shall advise
all her friends who have rheumatism to dismiss
their doctors and use St. Jacobs oil.

To 11. F. Kugblmann, Esq.
Dear Sir,—This is to certify that I, Patrick Keenan, was
taken ill about three years ago with a severe cold, which
turned into Bronchitis and became chronic. 1 considted
more than one doctor, and during that time took a great
quantity of medicine without it doing me the slightest
good, but I became worse every day, ' wasting away until
1 became a perfect skeleton. About February last I began
to spit up blood, and what with the cough and severe
pains in my left lung, and the quantity of bad matter I
was expectorating every day, I became very much alarmed.
Hearing of your professional skill I consulted you, and
you told me you could cure me for a given sum. I agreed
and went under your treatment in March last. At the
end of three months I was taken had one morning, and
vomited about two pints of blood, matter and stringy
phlegm. From that time I commenced to improve, and
was gaining in weight every day. About a month ago the
blood ceased coming, the cough disappeared, and the
lung healed completely, and thank God and your pro-
fessional skill, I am as well as ever.
P. KEENAN.

An Unusual Conclusion.
BY W. C. MORROW.
Mk. Clarke Randolph was stupefied by a discovery
which he had just made —his wife had proved un-
faithful, and the thief of her honour was his
nearest friend, Henry Stockton. If there had
been the least chance for a doubt, the unhappy
husband would have seized upon it, but there was
none whatever.
Let us try to understand what this meant to
such a man as Randolph. He was a high-bred,
high-spirited man of 30, descended from a long
line of proud and chivalrous men, educated, re-
fined, sensitive, generous, and brave. His fine
talents, his dash, his polished manner, his in-
dustry, his integrity, his loftiness of character had
lifted him upon the shoulders of popularity and
prosperity; so that in San Francisco, his home,
there was not another man of his age, a member
of his profession, the law, who was so well known,
so well liked, or wielded such a power.
He had been married four years. His wife was
beautiful, winsome, and intelligent; and she had
always had from him the best devotion that a
husband could give his wife. He and Stockton
had been friends for many years. Next to his
wife, Randolph had loved and trusted him above
all others.
Such was the situation. At one stroke, he had
lost his wife, his home, his best friend, his honour,
his confidence in human nature, his spirit, his
ambition. These—and essentially they were all
that made up his life, except the operation of
purely animal functions—had gone all at once,
without a moment’s warning.
Well, there was something to be done. A keen
sense of the betrayal, a smarting under the gross
humiliation, urged him to the natural course of
revenge. This, as he sat crouched down in a chair
in his looked office, he began systematically to
arrange, struggling earnestly to bring his mind
under control and direct his thoughts into coherent
forms. The first idea —always first in such cases
—was to kill. That, in the case of a man of his
spirit and temperament, was a matter of course.
Fear of the legal consequences found no place
within him. Besides, suicide would settle that
exceedingly small part of the difficulty.
So it was first decided that as the result of this
discovery three persons had to die—his wife, his
friend, and himself. Very well; that took a load
from his mind. An orderly and intelligent
arrangement of details now had to be worked out.
A plan which would bring the largest results in
the satisfaction of a desire for revenge must be
chosen. The simple death of those two, the bare
stoppage of breath, would be wholly inadequate.
First, the manner of taking their lives must have
the quality of strength and a force which in itself
would have a large element of satisfaction; hence
it must be striking, deliberate, brutal, if you wish;
revolting, if you are particular. Second, it must
be preceded by exposure, denunciation, publica-
tion, scorn, contempt, and terror.
That much was good—what next ? There were
various available means for taking life. A re-
volver suggested itself. It makes a dark, red
spot; the very sight of the weapon, held steadily
and longer than necessary, levelled at the place
where the spot is to appear, is terrifying; there is
a look of fright succeeded by one of pain; then
uplifted’arms, an appeal for mercy, a protest of
innocence, a cry to God ; after that the white face,
the toppling to the floor, eyes rolled upward,
bluish lips apart, a dark pool on the carpet—all
that was very good. The wretched man felt
better now that he was beginning to think so
clearly!
But there was poison, also—poison in variety ;
arsenic, which burns and corrodes, causing great
pain often for hours; strychnine, which acts
through the nerves, producing convulsions and
sometimes a fixed distortion of the features, whicli
even the relaxation of death cannot remove; cor-
rosive sublimate, prussic acid, cyanide of potas-
sium—too quick and deadly. It must be a poison,
if poison at all, which will bring about a sensible
progression through perceptible stages of agony,
so that during this time the efficiency of physical
pain may be raised by the addition of mental
suffering.
Were these all the methods? Yes —enough for
this purpose. Then, which should it be—revolver
or poison? It was a difficult problem. Let it
first be settled that the three should be together,
locked in a room, and that the two guilty ones
should suffer first, one at a time. The revolver
won.
Randolph was in the act of leaving his office
to go and buy the weapon, when he was startled
by what he saw in his office mirror. It required
% moment for him to recognise his own reflection.
His face was unnaturally white, a discoloration
was under his eyes, which had a glassy
appearance, his lips were pressed tightly together,
the corners of his mouth drawn dowiu large, dark
veins standing out on his temples. Fearing that
if, while in this condition, he should apply to a
gunsmith for a revolver he would be refused, he
stood for some time before the mirror trying to
restore the natural expression of his face. He
kneaded his lips to remove their stiffness, pinched
i his cheeks to bring back their colour, rubbed
down the rigid veins, and scraped a little of the
white plaster from the wall and with it concealed
the dark colour under his eyes. Then he went
forth with a firm step, bought the revolver
without difficulty, tried it, satisfied himself that
it was reliable, loaded it, put it into his pocket,
and returned to his office
For there were certain matters of property to be
attended to. He had a considerable fortune, all
his separate possession ; his wife had brought nun
nothing. He now felt clear-minded enough to
dispose of his estate intelligently. He drew hit'
will —a holographic instrument —devising h'“
wealth to various persons and benevolent societies,
and called in two clerks to witness it.
He glanced at his office clock. There would be
four long hours yet before the time for going home
to dinner. Fortunately for his plans, Stockton
was to dine with them that evening, and neither
of the guilty ones knew that they had been dis-
i covered. How should Randolph employ tnes 1
' weary hours ? There was nothing to do, nothing
even to think of. He tried to read a news
paper, then a book, and failed; looke
out upon the crowds which thronged the street,
counted the tram-cars awhile ; tried other things,
failed at everything, and then sat down.
Something was beginning to work m tt
wretched man. 1. ns see : His wife, while pre-
tending the warmest arfeetion for him, was re-
ceiving the guilty attentions of a traitor in 1 1
house; she had betrayed and dishonoured be
husband, had wrecked his life, had driven bun
his death. Really, therefore, she had swept aside
all the obligations which the marital relation im
posed. In essence she was no longer his wife,
a criminal enemy who, with deliberate anu

Strange case was lately tried in the London
Law Courts about a carpet. Mrs. Brunton nad
a carpet valued at 1000 guineas, and sent it to the
large firm of Maple and Co. to be cleaned. They
handed it over to a wretched employe named Ire-
land, who carried it to his miserable garret, where
he took out the stains with benzoline, which
caused a fire, burning two of his children to death
and the carpet was destroyed. It recalls the story
of Morel, the starving lapidary, in Eugene Sue’s
“ Mysteries of Paris.” In his attic, with a family
of skeletons, he worked on jewels valued at a
million.

abounding malice, had destroyed him. He could
go to the grave with a willing heart, but he could
not permit her to live and enjoy his downfall and
gloat over his destruction. But would she really
do that ? And then, God, she was a woman. A
strong man, his strength reinforced by a revolver,
employs deception to bring a woman into a room,
locks the door, insults, humiliates, and terrifies
her, brandishes a revolver, and then kills her like
a rat in its hole. Can a brave man, of mature
judgment and in possession of his faculties, do
such a thi*g ? Why, it would be not only murder
but cowardice as well. No; it could not be done.
She was still a woman, with all the weakness, all
the frailty which her sex imposed. It could not
be done.
After all, it would be far sweeter revenge to let
her live, bearing through life a brand of infamy.
That would be much better. She would lose her
high position and the respect of her friends ; the
newspapers would publish her shame to the world,
pointing her out by name as the depraved woman
who had betrayed her husband and driven him to
suicide; they would have her portrait in their
columns; her name and crime would be hawked
upon the street by loud-crying newsboys ; sermons
denouncing her would be preached in all the
churches; her shame would be discussed every-
where —in homes, shops, hotels, bar-rooms, in San
Francisco and many other cities.
Not only that, but she would be stripped of all
the property which she had enjoyed so much. She
would be turned adrift upon the streets, for no one
would help her, none have a kind word for her,
none give her even the respect which money might
command. Being thus turned out upon the world
all friendless and alone, and being naturally de-
praved, she would seek the help of fast and shady
men. Thus started, and soon taking to drink, as
such women always do, down she would plunge
into a reckless and shameless career, sinking
lower and lower, losing her beauty, becoming
coarse, loud, and vulgar; then, arriving at that
stage when her beauty no longer could be a source
of revenue, drifting into vile dens, consorting
with the lowest and most brutal blackguards,
finding herself dragged often before police magis-
trates, first for drunkenness and then for theft,
serving short terms in prison with others as low ;
finally, one night brought shrieking with delirium,
tremens to the police-station, bundled out to the
hospital, strapped firmly to an iron bed, and then
dying with foul oaths upon her lips—such a life
would be infinitely worse than death, such re-
venge immeasurably vaster than the pistol. Then
it was finally decided that she must live and
suffer.
As to the friend—as to Stockton, the betrayer,
the sneak, the coward— he should die like a dog.
That decision could not be reconsidered. He
should not be granted the privilege of a duel, for
not only was he wholly undeserving of such con-
sideration, but by such means his life might be
spared. Evidently she loved him, doubtless he
loved her. He living and the husband killed in a
duel, their satisfaction would be doubled —having
wrecked and humiliated him and driven him to
despair, they then killed him. After that, they
could enjoy each other’s society openly, unmo-
lested, and without fear of detection or punish-
ment. Besides, they might marry and both be
happy. This was unthinkable. He must be
killed, he must die like a dog, and he must go to
his death with a foul stain on his name.
These things being settled, the wretched man
re-read the will. As the woman was to live, she
niust be mentioned in the document. He tore up
the will and wrote another, in which he bequeathed
her one dollar, setting forth her shame as the
reason for so small a bequest. Then he wrote out
a separate statement of the whole affair, sealed it,
addressed it to the coroner, and placed it in his
pocket. It would be found there after awhile.
Well, why this trembling in every member, this
unaccountable nausea, this unconquerable feeling
of horror and repugnance as the draft of the pic-
ture was contemplated? Did instinct arise and
dumbly plead for mercy ? What mercy had been
shown, that mercy could be expected ? None
whatever. There was not only revenge to be
satisfied, but justice also. Still it was hor-
rible ! Admit that she deserved it all, de-
served even more, she was a woman ! No act of
hers could deprive her of her natural claims upon
the stronger sex. As a woman she had inalienable
rights which even she could not forfeit, which men
could not withhold. And then, where could be
the benefit of adding physical suffering to
mental ? One surely would weaken the force of
the other. The lower she should fall and the
deeper her degradation, the smaller would become
the efficiency of her mental agony; and yet mental
suffering was the kind which it was desired should
fall upon her.
It would be well, therefore, to leave her some
money—a considerable amount of money—in
order that, holding herself above the want which
in her case would lead to degradation and a blunt-
ing of the sensibilities, she might suffer all the
more keenly—in order that the memory of her
shame might be for ever poignant, forever a cause
for the sharpest regrets. This would be better in
other ways ; her shame published, she could never
associate with those fine characters who had
been her friends ; her lover dead and his memory
disgraced, he could not be present to console her ;
for society she would have only those whom her
fortune would attract, and they were not of a kind
to satisfy such a woman as she ; she would always
be within sight of the old life and its pleasures,
but just beyond the pale—near enough to see and
long for, but too far to reach, and for ever kept
back by the cold glance of contempt, the disdain of
the high circle in which she had been reared.
Therefore, it was better to leave her Che bulk of
his fortune. So he tore up a second will and ■
wrote a third, in which, while naming her as his
principal legatee, he incorporated the story of her
shame. He felt better now than at any time since
his discovery. He walked about the room, looked
out the window, then fell into his chair again.
How strangely alike in many respects _are all
animals, including man ! There are qualities and
passions common to them all-hate, fear, anger,
revenge, love, fondness for offspring. In what is
man superior to the others ? Manifestly in self-
control, a sense of justice, the attribute of mercy,
the quality of charity, the power to forgive, the
force of benevolence, the operation of gratitude,
an appreciation of abstractions, an ability to com-
Eare, contrast, and adjust, consciousness of an in-
erent tendency to higher and better achieve-
ments. To the extent that he lacks these does he
approach more closely to the lower orders. To the
degree that the passions common to all have
masbory over him does he lack the finer qualities
which distinguish his species. The desire to kill
when hurt, angered, or threatened is stronger the
lower we descend in the scale of the orders—the
lower we descend even among the members of the
same order. The least-developed men are the
most brutal. Revenge is the malice of anger.
It is strange that his thoughts should have taken
such a turn !
And then, the fundamental instinct which
guards the perpetuation of the species is common
to all, and its manifestations are controlled by a
universal law, whose simple Variations do not im-
pair its integrity. Love and mating—these are
the broad lines upon which the perpetuation of
the species starts. What possible abstractions
are there in them ? Is not their character concrete
and visible? Whatever fine sentiments are
evolved, we know their source and comprehend
their function. There is no mystery here.
What is this jealousy, which all animals may
have ? It is an instinctive resentment, by one of a
mated pair, of something which interferes with a
pleasant established system, the basis of which is
perpetuation of the species. Higher mankind has
the ability to dissect it, analyze it, understand it,
and guard against its harmful operation; herein
lie the distinguishing qualities of superiority. If,
when his Jealousy is aroused, he is unable to act
any differently from the lion, the horse, or the
dog, then, in that regard, he is not superior to
them. Man, being an eater of meat, is a savage
animal, like the dog, the tiger, the panther, the
lion. His passions are strong, as are theirs; but
he has qualities which enable him to hold them in
check. If an animal have a strong attachment
for his mat* j , he will fight if she be taken from
him—this is the operation of jealousy. If he
be a savage animal, he will kill if he can
or dare. Few males among the animals
will kill their desertjpg mates —that is left
for man, the noblest of the animals. The
others are content to kill the seducer. What
cause for thankfulness there is for escape from an
act, so recently contemplated, which would have
placed its perpetrator below the level of the most
savage of the brutes? In what of all that was
now proposed to be done was there any quality to
distinguish the acts from those of the most savage
brute, except a more elaborate detail, the work of
superior malice and ferocity ? Is it a wonder that
Randolph shuddered when he thought of it?
The broadest characteristic of all animals, in-
cluding man, is selfishness. In man, it reaches its
highest form and becomes vanity, pride, and a
ridiculous sense of self-importance. But man
alone is conscious of its existence, character, and
purpose ; he alone encourages its rational develop-
ment and suppresses the most evil of its abuses.
The animal Which would fight or kill from jealousy
is moved by a selfish motive only. It proceeds to
satisfy its anger or gratify its revenge without any
regard to the ethics, without any thought of its
obligations to nature, without the slightest wish to
inquire whether there may not be in the cause of
its jealousy a natural purpose which is proceeding
upon the very lines that led to its mating. A
man, however, can think of these things, weigh
them carefully, understand them approximately,
and then advance in the light of wisdom. If not,
he is no better, in this regard, than the animal
which can not so reason and understand. This
manner of thinking was bringing the unhappy
man closer to himself.
Then, having faced the proposition that he had
been considering his own case all along, he found
the situation to be somewhat like this: He had a
certain understanding which should operate to re-
move him from influences which with men of
inferior conceptions Would be more powerful; not
being a brute, he should rise above impulses which
a brute is constrained by its nature to obey. So
much was clear. Then, Avhat should he do ? He
pondered this long and seriously.
Was it possible to wipe out the past with ex-
posure, humiliation, shame, and blood? He had
been proud of her, he had loved her, he had been
very, very happy with her. She had been his
inspiration, a part of his hopes, his ambition, his
life. True, she had undone all this, but the
memory of it remained. Until this recent act of
shame, she had been kind, unselfish, gentle, and
faithful. Who knows why she fell? Who could
sound the depths of this strange mystery; who
measure the capacity of her retistance ; who judge
her frailty with a righteous mind ; who say that
at that very moment she was not suffering un-
speakable things ? And then, was there any one
so noble of character, with integrity so unfailing
and so far beyond temptation, that he might say
he was better than she? Her weakness—should
we presume to call it depravity when we cannot
know, and might we with intelligent knowledge
of our own conduct lay the whole responsibility
upon her, and none upon that which made her ?
If we are human, let us seek wherein we may con-
vince ourselves that we are not brutes. Compas-
sion is an attribute of a noble character. The test
bf manhood is the exercise of its qualities;
What good would come from this revenge bf
humiliation and exposure ? It would not mend
the wrong, it would not save life ; it would be only
proof of the vanity, the sense of self-importance
of the injured one. Would it be possible to spare
her? Yes. That finally was settled. She should
live, she should have the property, she should be
left to enjoy life as best she could without the
shadow of a stain upon her name. That were the
nobler part, the test of manhood. And then, the
past could not be forgotten !
Randolph felt so much better after arriving at
this decision that he marvelled at himself. He
walked about the room feeling strong and elastic.
He tore up the will because it charged her crime
upon her; tore up the letter to the coroner ; col-
lected all the scraps of paper and carefully burned
them; Then he drew a tteW Will, free from stale,
leaving all his property to his wife. He did not
only that, he also wrote her a letter—formal, of
course—merely saying that he had found his life a
mistake ; this he sealed, addressed, and placed in
his pocket.
Stockton—the false friend, the betrayer and
destroyer—he should die, he should die like a dog.
But not with a stain on his name—that were im-
possible, because it would reflect upon her.
Here was a new situation. The two men would
be found dead, likely in the same room—the friend
and the husband. What would people think? A
duel? For what reason? Murder and suicide!
Who had handled the weapon, and for what
possible cause? The road which suspicion would
travel was too short and wide. The fair name of
the wife was to be guarded—that had been
decided upon, and now it was the first considera-
tion.
There were other matters to bo thought of.
Suppose that Stockton had been the husband and
Randolph the friend ? God ! let us think. Have
brutes, frenzied with rage and jealousy, the
power to hold nature’s mirror before the heart, to
feel compassion, to exercise charity, to weigh with
a steady hand the weaknesses and frailties of their
kind, to feel humility, to bow the head before the
inscrutable ways of nature? Have they not?
No? Well, then, have men? If they have not,
they are no better in that regard than brutes.
Besides, would it punish Stockton to kill him?
There can be no punishment in death ; it can be
only in dying; but even dying is not unpleasant,
and death is the absence of suffering. There was
no way under heaven to give him adequate
punishment.
Nor was that all. She loved him —that must be
so. What would be the benefit of removing him
from her life? It would be merely revenge—
revenge upon both of them ; and where lies the
nobility of such revenge? If they both should
live, both go unexposed, they might be happy
together.
After all, whom would that disturb, whose
pleasure interfere with ? Surely no sound of their
happiness could penetrate the grave; violence
would be done to none of nature’s laws. Why
should they not be happy? If they could, why
should they not ? Was there any reason under
the sun that charity, compassion, and a high man-
hood could give why they should not be happy ?
But suppose that she should suspect the cause of
her husband’s suicide ; this would likely poison her
life, for the consciousness of guilt would give form
to suspicion. The result would be an abhorrence
of self, a detestation of the participant in her sin,
a belief that the blood of her husband was upon
her head, and a long train of evils which would
seriously impair, if not wholly destroy, the desired
serenity of her life. Was there any way to prevent
the birth of such a suspicion ?
Yes; there was a way. As soon as Randolph
had worked it out he felt as if an enormous load
had been removed from him. His eyes shone
brightly, his cheeks were flushed, and a look of
pride and triumph lighted up his face.
He returned to his chair, removed the revolver
from his pocket and laid it on the table; wrote his
wife an affectionate letter, in which he told her
that he had just become aware of an incurable ail-
ment which he had not the courage to face through
months or years of suffering, and begged her to
look to Stockton for friendship and advice; wrote
Stockton, charging him with her protection;
burned the last will that he had made and drew a
new one, in which he left them the property
jointly, on condition that they married within two
years. Then, with a perfectly clear head, he laid
down his pen and sighed, but his face was bright
and tranquil. He picked up the revolver, cocked
it, placed the muzzle against his temple, and
without the tremor of a nerve pressed the trigger.

846 Macquarie-street North, Sydney, September 24, 1890
My Dear Moorabinda,—
Captain Trench, A.D.C., chiefly remarkable during his
sojourn in Sydney for a taciturnity worthy of a philoso
pher and a hopeless upper-lip where never moustache
would sprout, leaves Sydney for ’Ome per first out-going
American mail. Captain Trench was a solemn, speechless
young man about six feet high, whose neckties always
matched some portion of his apparel, and who smiled as
if it hurt him. People who liked to sit and bask in his
wide, unvarying silence when the universal chatter dis-
tracted them at balls or hops will miss him and mourn
him and take to haunting the society of mutes and the
deaf and dumb and the dead to fill the great aching
vacuum caused by his departure. Miss Nellie Cox, his
pretty fiancee, shortly leaves for England direct, where
she will be the guest of her prospective bridegroom’s
father, Colonel Trench, until the marriage comes off.
And, apropos to vice-regal goings and comings, Captain
Helbert is to be retained as private secretary, not aide-de-
camp as was at first announced, by the belted Earl whose
literary countess is about to reign in the red drawing-
room, and have her cultured ear tortured by the repre-
sentative English of her leading subjects. I wonder, by
vhe way, if sassiety has duly balanced all that a governor s
wife with a happy pen may mean to it ultimately ?
nappen to know (from the other end of the world) that
the “ home ” letters written by one vice-regal lady would,
if published, have made Australian snobdom sit up and
snort for eighteen months.
Not even the most rudimentary female fresh from the
Spinifex, whose most expansive idea of fashion was a
burnt-straw hat and lasting boots would have been moved
to enthusiasm over the rags at Randwick on Graven Plate
day—the off-day of the four. The feminine attendance
wasn’t imposing, probably because the vice-regal Spring
ball on the anterior evening had been kept up till next
day, and even the pinkest face - powder cannot avail
against the fishiness of the post-festivity eye. The vice-
regal party coached out (the Countess of Hopetoun
beside Lord Carington on the box), arriving in time to see
Carbine carry his owner’s paper-ink-and-sealing wax
colours to glory. Lady Carington had donned a simple
dress in French-grey cashmere made with a straight skirt
finished at the hem with a row of dark grey velvet and a
line of pointed white lace, the bodice having Zouaves of
the lace and front of white chiffon, a girdle of grey velvet
tied at the back, bonnet in grey-dawn gauze and butter-
cups, white veil. The Countess of Hopetoun wore an
unimpressive Mary-Janeish delaine in cream figured with
green, the visite (ending short at the waist-line dorsally)
in black figured in gold and finished in front with ruffles
of black lace—black, yellow and pink were combined in
her bonnet, and her gamp was black ; Mrs. Acland Hood
escaped notice in a black gown aggravated with black
velvet made with a loose jacket over a cream vest checked
in patriotic green, black and yellow hat, a cream parasol
—and a red carnation in her button-hole; Mayoress
Rurdekin wore pale-grey bordered in grey silk, full front
of white chiffon, silver-fox boa and touches of pink in the
silver-grey bonnet.
Those women who risk the trip to Randwick should be
careful not to shuffle over the face of Nature, but to lift
their tootsies at every step in that more or less graceful
curve which is, when properly effected, reminiscent of a
fowl crossing a wet barnyard. For the truth is the lawn
at Randwick wants to be born again, and the sower of
lawn-grass seed should be set to work immediately by the
management, when a properly-grassed promenade will be
the result —if the sower has not boiled his stock-in-trade
beforehand to secure an encore job, so to speak. The
present lawn is as tricky as a dark paddockful of sur-
veyors’ pegs, for the grass is in ever-recurring bumps and
knobs, which trip you up at every step. On Derby-day a
lady in brown and yellow stripes and a poppy bonnet
(I mention the toilette to accentuate the misfortune) went
neatly head-over-tip through catching her tan toes in one
of these. And as it was after luncheon—but this is avery
censorious world.
The cachet of the toilettes on Metrop. Day at Randwick
(when yours truly was among the redeemed who had
backed the parroquet colours of Little Bernie) was that
nearly everybody wore the gladsome garments of Derby
Day. The vice-regal throne showed an exception to this
economical rule—the ladies therein all wearing something
not shown before at the meeting. Lady Carington s dress
was in sage-green fine cashmere, the skirt made plain and
edged with a band of black lace, the basque bodice and
sleeves covered with lace with plastron of the green, bon-
net in black lace, green ribbon and mignonette, with
black beauty-spotted white fall; parasol in mottled
cream and green, the ribs outlined in sage-green ribbon
Lady Hopetoun appeared in a strange evening-dress-
looking gown in black lace and moire ribbons with black
heads about it, the bodice in green velvet seams outlined
jn black jet, black bow bonnet covered with black spot
veil, and a red carnation at the throat; black moire
parasol. Lady Constance Coombe wore ash-grey sur-
mounted by a sealing-wax toque. Lady Charles Scott
(who evidently takes for her motto “ Admirals’ wives
should he seen and not heard ”) was in zinc-grey cashmere;
and Miss Achurch in cream and lilac gown and soft white
hat. Then one readily forgave the enthusiast who did the
lawn in John Mayo’s colours (blue and black), since bhu
is completely out of court this spring, and even Venus
wreathed in a cerulean scarf, would make people remem-
her the band was playing.
The chief novelty of Steeplechase Day—the final flutter
of the A.J.C. Spring meet—was the scratching of Carbine
for the Randwick Plate, since this cedar-coloured wonder
generally appears being whacked up the straight with a
towel to the starting-post whenever his name adorns the
card ; otherwise the general aspect of things showed a
repetition of Derby Day, even to bonnets and frocks. The
gubernatorial party coached out as usual, and the light-
ning change Governor Carington undergoes from the tan-
hued hard-hitter and bilious overcoat of the tooler of the
team of bays to the frock and “nail kaag ” of the lawn
confuses pebple who don’t understand the toilet-etiquette
of the box-seat and who are not cm courant with His
Excellency’s profile, so to speak. All the vice-regalities
were there, of course. Shot dark-blue and copper silk
designed in gold with sleeves and Direptoire front of pale-
blue chiffon, bonnet in gold straw and forget-me-nots, was
Lady Carington’s attire on the occasion of her farewell
visit to Randwick. Lady Hopetoun wore black lace and
moire ribbon and black passementerie, small black bonnet
with pale-blue Alsatian bow, black net veil; Lady
Charles Scott wore yellow subdued by black, hat en
mite ; Miss Hill was attired in pale-fawn cloth bordered by
a deep check, coronet hat trimmed with cream feathers ;
Miss Marks wore a very dainty gown in white, pongee
with Valenciennes insertion let in, front of frilled chiffon,
pansy toque. Carrie Swain also wore white silk with a
floral design in silvery white, white scoop hat trimmed
with white ribbons and feathers ; Mrs. Brough (who looked
terribly tired and over-worked) wore a cream flannel
get-up made with a loose jacket over a vest of white silk,
white rolled-up felt hat and feathers; Marian Burton’s
gown was a pale-blue delaine flowered in tiny carnations
fashionably frilled at the feet; the bodice ornate with
silver gimp, a soft blue sash falling from the left hip,
small bonnet in silver straw and forget-me-nots, cream
parasol glorified by a huge blue bow. And a certain
amount of interest was lent to the scene by a massive
lady with a gold-washed crop attired in purple silk and
velvet, who carried a small terrier done up in a blanket
under her left arm, with its tail hanging through at the
back. The only drawback to this interesting spectacle
was that she should have dyed the beast to match her
hair.
A local journal weeps over its own idea that the vice of
horse-betting is sapping the morals of the society female,
and the writer graphically shudders at the possibility of a
feminine Juggins. But such a thing is impossible, except
as a phenomenon. I have studied the woman who bets
and Ido not fear for her—not much. You know her by
her limp-thumbed race-book and anxious eyebrows—her
eager eye on the soratohings and the fact that she never
gets beyond a lay-out of a dozen pounds. When she is a
winner she squeals and shakes hands with her male
friends—sometimes she hops or pirouettes—but she is the
very worst loser the world ever saw. The deadest cer-
tainty at money on doesn’t tempt her —her favourite odds
are 4 to X ; she mistrusts them longer, and even when she
has a “ moral ” she seldom stakes more than five pounds,
and spends the intervening time gasping against the rail
of the members’ stand, feeling ruin staring her in the face
and wishing she hadn’t done it.
I wonder it doesn’t strike the two B.’s, with the force
of a cyclone, that variety' is the spice of life, and that in
staging “Dandy Dick” during race week the public meta-
phorically had horse for breakfast, dinner and tea, and
couldn’t escape his spectral hoofs even during the hours
dedicated to Thespis. For the person who has perseveringly
plunged On the last Beast all day doesn’t yearn to hear
tantalisingly long prices offered about a dead moral behind
the floats, and even the winner isn’t so rabid as to wish to
breathe an atmosphere of odds and horse till it is time to
go home. But every girl who loves to array herself in a
man’s “dickey” and to knot her brother’s best scarf
round her neck in an amateur bow, should be forcibly
taken to “Dandy Dick” just to show how badly the
female in a man’s coat and vest and hat looks when con-
trasted with a woman in a pale-blue tea gown and golden
frizzes. Possibly “ George Tid” (Mrs. Brough) grasps this
solemn fact, for in the middle act she comes out in a
teaser of a dinner-gown instead of the mock swallowtail
and boiled shirt which one expected from a turfy trickster
who wore yellow spots, promenaded with a riding-whip,
and alluded to the dinner-hour as “ time to get ray nose-
bag on.” This unexpected gown (highly reminiscent of
the Brown-Potter methods, by the way), was in grey silk,
the bodice and long train brocaded in darker grey, the
sides of plain grey satin shirred on the right hip and
caught by a steel ornament; the front draped in silver-
spangled gauze—elbow sleeves of net latticed with silver
and ridged high on the shoulder in grey brocade lined
with saffron and finished with steel fringe: grey Sufsde
shoes. Miss Harcourt (as Salome) wore yellow silk well
draped and finished with folds of chiffon, fan in yellow
gauze and pansies.
It is an artistically depressing fact that the British Loan
collection in York-street, Sydney, even though baited
with the allurement of gratuitous afternoon tea, was
neither a fashionable nor a financial success, so that the
promoters may leave Sydney coldly out of their booking
when next their patchy panorama stumps the country.
In other cities rows of artistically unequal canvasses were
one of the leading attractions where the “silver-tailed”
congregated rapturously, but in Sydney the audience
mostly consisted of the lantern-jawed lady with the
capacity of an ostrich, hovering hungrily around the tea-
table and devouring currant-cake as if her object was
suicide by surfeit; but at last it dawned upon her brain
that for the entrance-fee she could get a far more thrilling
shilling’s worth outside, and so even she dwindled away
until only the fulsome dead-head was left, and the
management shut up in disgust. Sydney people—like all
other savages—are rather addicted to pictures, but pro*
bably the facts that the N.S.W. Art Society’s Spring show
opened on top of the other, and that there were one or
two new and beautiful frames lately imported to the
Domain Gallery, may have had something to do with
their sudden capacity for staying away. Let’s hope so, at
any rate.
" Speaking of art reminds me that the ladies of the
N.S.W. Art Society entertained a party of people at a
conversazione in the Pitt-street rooms on 19th inst. As
invitations had been lavish and comprehensive, there was
a crowd present—the fact of the Union Club ball happen-
ing on the same evening in no way affecting the attend-
ance, which was, as usual, a crush. N.S.W. Art Society’s
capacity for crowding people like herrings in a barrel is
their pet proficiency, and they really shouldn’t be so en-
thusiastic over their invitation-cards until the thermo-
meter is restored to its four feet or the picture-gallery
wherein they festivate is less painfully suggestive of the
top-storey. The President’s talented wife gracefully offi-
ciated as the hostess of the occasion.
The literary tabbies really expect great things from
Lady J. Under the Carington regime society was top
sawyer, and literature—semi-literature of the kind that
always puts two fingers on its pen and writes over a
blotting-pad—was painfully conscious that its hat was of
more consequence than its hexameters and its figure miles
ahead of its philosophy. And since its rounded periods
and involved propositions couldn’t arouse the vice-regal
interest as could a French cook or a Paris bonnet,
literature had to take a back seat, where it remains up
to the present. But with Lady Jersey an era of essay-
reading and submarine discussion is prophesied, where
all the crowded-out females who agitate themselves in the
« conservative ” papers over thrilling questions that have
been done to death ages ago will meet and gathe*
together to discuss tea and theories or coffee and
conchoiogy in the halls lately desecrated by song and
dance. This is the millenium which semi-literary tabbies
have sketched out for themselves and which is to dawn
behind the Countess of Jersey.
The fact that several “rainbow crapes” were worn at
Government House ball on 17th inst., induces me o
mention that at Messrs. A. Downe and Co.’s Japanese
show-rooms, in King-street, these new sensations are to be j
found—faintly and prismatically hued and priced at a ,
little over five-shillings a yard. Then the silk crepes are ,
delicious at a similar figure, and in all oolouis. In ie
fantastic incense-scented room there are fans, photo,
frames, Japanese tea-gowns (the Melbourne fad just now)
in silk, and delicately embroidered, at a most moderate
price, while the girl who has a sweetheart about to have a
birthday is advised to inspect the quilted silk and silk-
lined jackets full of necessary pockets and lavishly em-
broidered with flowers, at a really “ sacrifice” price, ihe
show-rooms are full of temptation.
Almost with a shook of inspiration it has dawned upon
Australian society that the aspect of its wide, ham-hke
hands isn’t so cream-white and velvety as is the ru ewi i
Family Herald heroines and other leading models, and
Miss Baokblocks shivers audibly at the very idea of Ma
blunt fingers and hereditary chap. The newspapers are
besieged with queries as to how to sharpen flat digit-
tips or render mauve finger-nails dawn-pink, and the
heartless reply is, “Consult a manicure ’’—but as we have
no manicures, society’s outreaohing after pared fingei
nails simply withers on its stem. Why doesn’t a manicure
rise up ? The art of nail-doctoring chiefly consists of a
quantity of clean rag, a few phials of polish, free action
of the elbow, a “ professional” face and a few Latin
quotations—and there you are. And as no other diploma)
than a large brass-plate and a few long, titled names at
the head of your handbill are necessary to set you up a s
a success, it seems impolitic that society crying out foi a
manicure at a guinea a visit, should be foolishly left to the
tender mercies of its nail-brush.
One of the farewell agonies which must happen before
Governor and Lady Carington can depart in peace will be
a concert (on 29th prox.) in the Centennial Hall, when a
chorus of 1500 State scholars will give full cry to a little
thing dashed off by the poet Allen, and set to music by
Alpen. All money taken to go to the Sick Children s
Hospital Fund, in which a committee of ladies are actively
interesting themselves.
It is unfortunately fashionable just now to crowd your
guests as if they were at a free luncheon or a riot, hence
the presence of nearly 1000 people at the first vice-regal
Spring ball on 17th inst., though Sydney Government -j
House could only hold half the number comfortably. And
in such a throng the gowning only produces a hazy effect
of massed colour. When the number of cards issued was
guessed at it is no longer wonderful that lots of women
were content to reproduce themselves even to their
bouquets. The hostess of the occasion wore pale-mauve
silk tin traine, the jupe draped with chiffon, a spray of
myrtle falling gracefully from the bodice on to the skirt,
mauve shoes and diamond ornaments—and opened the
ball with Sir Frederick Darley, Lord Carington dancing
with Lady Charles Scott (in ciebblue satin and chiffon
relieved with blush roses); Admiral Lord Charles Scott
with the Countess of Hopetoun (wearing aubergine faille
Francaise, relieved with pale-mauve spotted tulle, diamond
ornaments); General Richardson danced with Mrs. Acland
Hood, who successfully combined gold-spangled tulle and
white brocaded silk most successfully. There were lots
of yellow, and several good white gowns, the most stylish
being worn by Mrs. Burdekin—of white armure with a
large floral pattern brocaded in satin worn over a ]upe ot
billowy white chiffon, a spray of scarlet berries and
diamond ornaments saving the gown from insipidity.
The second vice-regal Spring ball happens on 25th inst.
Yours affectionately,
SAPPHO SMITH.
Two well-gilt Victorian engagements have just been
publicly announced: Miss Ernestine Stevenson, of
“ Laru ridel,” Toorak, to Mr. F. W. Prell, of lona,
Toorak; and Miss Ethel Fenner, of St. Kijda, to Mr.
Percy Chirnside, son of the late Andrew Chirnside, of
Werribee.
The “ Army ” farewell dinner to Lord Carington, who is
Commander-In-Chief, is to happen at the Centennial Hal
on 10th prox., at 7.30, and is to be a full regimental
occasion, swords and all. Several ladies have secured
seats in the galleries, and, provided they dont get
hungry, the sight should be interesting.
Sydney Australian Club ball on 12th inst., in the Cen-
tennial Hall, was most successful— commencing at 9 and
terminating at 3 a.m. Lady Carington wore sunbeam-
yellow silk with folds and ruches of crepe chiffon, shoes
en suite, and diamond ornaments. A novelty in the
decorations were canaries in gilded cages, while the
rendezvous were indicated by large numbers with rather
railway-station effect. _

The Grenadiers’ Disgrace.
(FOR THE BULLETIN.)
At early morn would the Guards depart,
At six—so the papers said,
Ere break of day I was out to say
Good-bye to the lads in red ;
Yet not with my old accustomed pride
I took my accustomed place,
For it came to me I’d a witness be
Of “the Grenadiers’disgrace.”
Disgrace of the men who’d reason why,
Nay—e’en to revolt had dared,
And who could blame if a well-eaimed shame
Were not for the rebels spared ?
No cure for the soldiers “ rights ” or “ wrongs ”
Is the sentimental trash
Of the timid fool; but the good old rule
Of the good old school —the lash.
How will they march through the silent streets
That oft they have trod with pride ?
With hang-dog looks that the passer greets
With scorn and the lads deride ;
Maybe but an early, surly few
Who scatter their chaff and jeers,
Will see them off if it’s but to scoff
At “the British Mutineers.”
But stay —is the city still asleep ?
Its day can have scarce begun.
Yet, what mean the broad, dark streams that
sweep
To meet at a point—but one.
And hark —■’tis a ringing British cheer
(Fit theme for your martial bards.)
If the friends of the men but muster here
All London’s out for the Guards.
Minus the pomp of the Park parade,
Yet smart as of old they stand,
And a lane through the silent crowd is made
At the stirring strains of the band ;
As proud of their exile —“ stiff as starch ”
With glance where no “ shame ” appears.
Rat-a-tat, they’re off to the grand old march
Of “The British Grenadiers.”
“ Give ’em another, boys—here they come !”
The crowd now a voice hath found,
And the cheer that deadens the rolling drum
Has meaning beyond its sound.
Is this a retort ?—but yesterday
(Nor that could their ardour damp)
Had heard the Guards the reproachful words
Of the hero of —the “Gamp.”
And now, as an escort kings might boast,
In step with their measured pace,
A mighty crowd were heartily proud
To share in the Guards’ “disgrace.”
If such be the fruits of “ Gampridge” spleen,
Disgrace has the Guards made dear,
This parting recalls that stirring scene
When they left for the red Crimea.
The mob for the men its approval hums
While the lads, though serene you find them,
Mean not to forget the scapegoat chums
(i As “examples ” left behind them ;
“We’ll have ’em out boys—lads, well done,”
Hearty the greetings spoken,
From “ fours ” do the Guards march one by one,
Their ranks by the wild rush broken.
Look to it, England—why will you
Men of the ranks revile;
Look to the dummy, dandy few,
And not to the rank and file.
Nor forget the heroes who bayonets wield
Who made your renown to shine,
And spread on many a bloody field
The fame of the thin red line.
England, beware—mark well the day
Thus marked by the Guards’ disgrace ;
They win, who thus dared to disobey,
In story an honoured place.
Where needed reform—where due the blame ?
Will answer the coming years,
But this is how London showed her shame
For the British Grenadiers.
WILLIAM E. IMESON.
London, August 14, 1890.
Insist upon having Wolfe’s Schnapps.
The Sydney Morning Herald, in chronic-
ling strike news, persists in using the word
“ wharfs.” The Herald used one time to talk of
“ foot pedestrians. ’
Wolfe’s Schnapps—a mild stimulant.
The cable now tells us that the deported
Guards are behaving beautifully at Bermuda.
Only the other day we heard that they had muti-
nied again. The cable man should lie consistently.
If out of sorts try Wolfe’s Schnapps.
Sir Redmond Barry is credited with the
statues in Fitzroy Gardens, Melb., but Baron Von
Mueller never could abide ’em. He has been
heard to say “ I dink doze statoots are not brobber.
Look at all de nurz-girls mid de berambuladers.
Wolfe’s Schnapps for lowness of spirits.
A Melbourne paper has the impudence to
put in a contribution of ss. “ from a working-man
for the Employers’ Union.” This must be Mr.
Uriah Heep. “Brother and me’s so ’umble;” or
perhaps it is the Rev. Mr. Mawworm, “I likes to
be despised.” Show us your horny hands, dear
boy.
Wolfe’s Schnapps will do you no harm.
Longmore, the veteran Victorian ex-par-
liamentarian, watched the Railway debate from
the Vic. Assembly gallery the other night, and
doubtless thought of old timber-trolling days. He
has dropped it all now, and works on his Tambo
farm with his sons ; but what a thorn he once was
in the sides of the land-monopolists ! At last
he found that the Conservatives had their heel on
the whole country, and that the Coalition was a
fraudy farce.

A big dispute has just been settled in
W.A. by compromise. The W.A. Land Company
sued the Government for breach of contract,
damages £35,000. The plaintiffs are the owners
and builders of the railway between Albany and
Beverley (connecting the former place with the
city), the line being built on the land-grant sys-
tem. Under the contract with the Government
•the company are entitled to 12,000 acres for every
mile of railway, the company to have the selection
of the lands, which means picking the eyes of the
country. The company now complain that the
Government have been making sales of land
within the limit allowed for their selection —20
miles each side of the line—and to this they
strongly object. After a preliminary hearing in
the Court a settlement was arrived at, the Govern-
ment agreeing not to sell any land in the pre-
scribed area until September, 1891, by which time
the company will have completed their selection.
The case, had it gone on, promised some nice
revelations as to how these huge land-grant con-
cessions are worked.
Wolfe’s Schnapps will make you a new man.
When the book, now being brewed by
Rudd, Maguire and Thompson, three African
travel-liars, concerning their adventures at the
King Kraal, Buluwayo, is published, Brigand
Stanley will have to take a back seat: “ ‘ Ah, yes,
Lo Ben is cruel,”’ pursued Mr. Thompson, rnedita-
tively. I remember once, when I was waiting
for an audience, I saw a man brought in who was
guilty of having drunk some of the King’s beer.
It was at the time of the great dance, when for a
month there is special license, and when anyone
carrying beer about is liable to have it raided. But
this man had levied toll on the King’s beer, when
it was being carried by the King’s women. The
poor wretch was brought before the King. He
was horribly afraid. His eyes stuck out of his
head, and his knees knocked together as he tried
to make obeisance. The King bade them hold
him fast, then he said, looking the culprit up and
down: ‘ You have a nose and a mouth, and two
ears, and two eyes. You have used your nose to
smell King’s beer —(turning to attendants)—cut
off his nose ! ’ They cut off the man’s nose.
‘ You have used your mouth to drink King’s
beer ; cut off his mouth !’ They cut off the man’s
lips. He was a horrid sight. Lobengula waited
a moment. Then he said, deliberately : ‘ You
have heard that it is not allowed to drink King’s
beer; but your ears are no good to you.’ Off
went the poor wretch’s ears. He looked at the
King with a look dreadful to see. ‘ Your eyes—
cover up his eyes !’ shouted the King. “ But his
forehead over his eyes, that they may not see
King’s beer !’ and they cut the forehead of the
man, and turned down the flap of skin as a sur-
geon might turn it, so that it hung over his eyes.
Then the King looked at the man for a few
minutes, and the man grovelled before him in the
dung; until suddenly the King fell into a rage—
perhaps he was ashamed of himself—and bade
them beat the man with logs of wood. They beat
him within an inch of his life. Last, the poor
wretch mustered strength to crawl away, like a
broken snake, along the ground ; and he went and
lay under a waggon until nightfall. Then he
crept down to the stream to bathe his wounds.
He came close past my waggon, and you never
saw such a ghastly sight as he was. The flap of
skin hung over his eyes, but it was dried and
stark.” Next!

You really ought to drink Wolfe’s Schnapps.
Speaking of Goodwood races, says Pen-
dragon ;
The Prince of Wales wore his tall hat on each occasion,
and, though he may have changed his bucket and
roundme’s, there was so little difference in their shape
and colour that he need hardly have taken the trouble.
His barnet is (I noticed as he bowed to someone) getting
very thin on the summit; and he really ought to take a
little more exercise, as he is becoming awfully thick about
the bushel. Round about his mince pies the fly’s plates
of meat are very noticeable.
We forget of what University Mr. Sampson was
senior wrangler.
If in need of a stimulant take Wolfe’s Schnapps,
There is a wicked story current of a social
potentate who, proud of the subjugation in which
he held his wife, took a big crowd of fellows home
very early one morning to supper. Arrived there,
they found the lady had retired, leaving a boy
and a domestic in waiting, who quickly provided
the revellers with bread and cheese, devilled bones
and liquid trimmings. Not satisfied with the
apparent quietude of this reception, the pompous
host selected a very fine bone from the dish that
fronted him, and placing it on a plate handed it
to the boy. “ Johnnie, take this up to your
mother, and tell her there’s a bone for her to
pick.” On the boy’s return he was asked what
his mother had said, and the reply was, “Go
down stairs and tell your father that he’s not your
father, and that’s a bone for him to pick.”
Wolfe’s Schnapps has no rival.

Tales of “The System.”
No. XI.—“The Hanging of the Eighteen”
(Spinning the Hemp.)
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
The Special Commission began its session
©n the Monday morning at 10 o’clock, and con-
cluded by the pronouncement of the sentences at
eight o’clock on the Saturday evening. Three
distinct accounts of that Assize, during which
Justice iiot only did not weep but did not even
breathe—she was simply non-existent —are before
us as we write. Each account is independent of
the others; apparently none of the writers knew
that others were also noting the proceedings.
Least of all did Special Commissioner Gaythorpe
ass, nincompoop and potent magistrate, suspect
—as he sat on his dais, endowed with an unex-
aggerable imbecility and the dread powers of High
Justice, and twiddling with his nerveless fingers
the pen with which he usurped the functions of
the Creator —giving to this man life, and to that
one death —least of all did he suspect that there
were three men in his thronged court who were
doing their best to save him from that oblivion
which in his case would have been so merciful. A
military officer, a clergyman, and a convict —the
last being one Barber, former solicitor, alleged forger
and assured hero, whose history is the bitterest
satire on British Institutions or British Justice
ever conceived all preserved records of that fatal
Assize.
But the picture, as drawn by these three men,
we do not propose to reproduce here. A genera-
tion which was shocked to its centre when Justice
was travestied by a certain trial that took place in
an Australian capital in December, 1886, would
not tolerate the outrage on its feelings that would
be involved in a plain, unvarnished report of the
Special Commission. All that we may venture to
do is to produce an occasional vignette from the
general design as sketched by the three hands.
Monday morning, 9th November, 184—,
The court-house, a building erected by Major
Foveaux of the “Rum-selling Corps ” and odorous
memory—was under repair, and the large building
known indiscriminately as the Ration-house and
Butchers’-shop, an adjunct to the stores, and the
place whence the rations were weighed and dis-
tributed to the cooks, was appropriated to the
purposes of the Commission. How the Weird
Sisters of Fate must have chuckled as Com-
mandant Scragge ordered the erection of the
Commissioner’s dais on the spot usually occupied
by the butcher’s block !
To this temporary Palace of Justice wended, at
9’45 a.m., a procession across the Grassplot.
Twenty soldiers in the van preceded a dozen of the
Island police—good conduct “lifers” every man
Jack of them —in their neat uniform of blue jean
jackets, white ducks, and cabbage-tree hats. Six
javelin-men, temporary appointments from short-
termed prisoners, came next. Then the State-
coach, with the Commissioner, duly robed and
wigged, the Attorney-General (ditto), and Civil
Commandant Scragge You could not find any-
where more distinguished samples of officialdom;
together they formed one of the most lustrous
gems in Her Majesty’s Crown. Following the
equipage the humbler instruments of the System,
Parson Ford and Superintendent Darrell, the
Superintendent of the Cascade and the Store-
keeper, Drs. Grocott and M'Phail. And, bringing
up the rear, a full company of military, and more
prisoners temporarily acting as auxiliaries to
the Establishment. Chaplain Taylor was not
present. He had not yet returned from the grave-
yard by the bench where he had been occupied in
reading prayers over the eleven men shot down in
the Chapel the previous day.
As the procession passed by the flagstaff which
arose from the middle of the Grassplot, and from
which was flapping lazily the “Nelson flag of
England,” a flourish on a bugle sounded from the
soldiers’ barracks.
“Why, surely,” drawled Mr. Archibald Julian
Gaythorpe, the Special Commissioner, “ that is the
old ‘ Roast Beef!’ Gad, now, that’s curious !”
“What, your Honor?” respectfully asked Mr.
Scragge. Mr. Scragge was particularly respectful
to the Commissioner, in whose power it was to do
the C.O. a good turn (or the reverse) in his report.
“That tune, now ! Fancy hearing the ‘Roast
Beef of Old England ’ in a prison—ha ! ha !
twenty thousand miles away from the old land !”
“Oh, it’ll be the bugler practising the special
mess-call. Wednesday’s to be guest-night with the
officers’ mess —in your honour, you know, sir—and
I needn’t remind you that the second call on
guest-nights is the dear old ‘ Roast Beef,”’said
the Commandant.
“ Gad, I remember now,” quoth Mr. Gaythorpe,
“A great lark I had once over that same ‘call,’
by the way.”
“Yes?” said Mr. Scragge, prepared beforehand
to smile at the narrative.
“Yes, a regular jolly lark it was. I was at
Oxford, you know, and was sent down—not ex-
pelled, ha ! ha ! but just rusticated for a year—
got into some trouble over a girl who kept a
chocolate-shop on the High, and the jade kicked
up a fuss— used to come to my rooms and make a
row. So the dons heard of it, and sent me down,
as if they’d never done that sort o’ thing them-
selves ”
“ Ah ! very good !” laughed Mr. Scragge—
“ Well, my people were living near a garrison
town, and, of course, having nothing to do, I was
a good deal with the fellows of the regiment. I
was asked to mess once or twice. The last time I
went early, intending to dress in the rooms of one
of the chaps. Well, I dressed, and was strolling
in one of the corridors (the first bugle had just
gone) when the bugler passed by to blow the
second call —the ‘Roast Beef.’ So I asked him
to go and tell Lieutenant Irvine I was waiting.
The fellow hesitated a moment—was on duty, he
said ; so I tipped him a shilling, and said I’d hold
his bugle. Anyway, he went, and what do you
think I did ?”
“ Can’t say, I’m sure,” said Mr. Scragge.
“Oh, I just ran into the nearest room and hid
the bugle. Fellow came out, couldn’t find me, of
course, or his bugle ; couldn’t find, either, another
bugle with the special fixings. You know they
blow the old tune on bugles with—what d’ye call
it ? —chromatic attachments, I think’s the term.
So he blew it, or tried to blow it, on an old trum-
pet —bungled the air, of course, couldn’t do the
flourishes—and made a devil of a mess of it. It
was properly a wess-tune, that was, ha ! ha !”
The Commandant laughed heartily at the Com-
missioner’s miserable pun. The Attorney-General
asked, drily : “And what about the bugler? Sent
to the halberds, I suppose, and presented with a
dozen lashes ?”
“No,”said his Honor the Commissioner. “Not
so bad as that, by George ! They kept him in
barracks for a week, though. Lord ! It must
have been great fun to have seen the man’s face
when he came back and couldn’t find either me or
his bugle. I was deuced sorry I missed that !”
“I don’t doubt you were,” said Mr. Attorney
Waring. Into Mr. Waring’s brain had already
entered the suspicion that perhaps Archibald
Julian Gaythorpe, Esq., of the Inner Temple,
barrister-at-law, was not the fittest person to hold
a commission to do justice as between the Queen’s
Majesty and the sixty or so prisoners waiting trial
at the Butcher’s Shop.
We should like (did not we fear it would be un-
due presumption on our part) to say that we share
his suspicion.
The bugler was still blowing when the Crier of
the Court —Barber, before referred to—demanded
silence. Amid a hush of expectancy, His Honor
the Special Commissioner took his seat, and —
following a memorandum as to the order of pro-
cedure drawn up by Mr. Scragge—called upon
the Clerk of Assizes to read his commission.
This was done—and the Bloody Assize of Nor-
folk Island was declared open for its business of
slaughter. Of course, the matter wasn’t put in
this blunt way, but that was, doubtless, due to
a natural delicacy on the part of the Crown.
Even the Inquisition indulged in euphemisms;
and just as it called its torture-chamber the
“ Apartment of Interrogation,” and its roasting
at the stake an auto-da-fe, so did Her Majesty’s
Government, in authorising the establishment of
a shambles at Norfolk Island, entitle its measure
to that end “An Act to appoint a Special Com-
mission to judicially try criminal offenders.”
Wonderfully sensitive the System was, at times,
of the feelings of its subjects !”
* * *
Monday afternoon. The reading over of
the indictments, which was begun as soon as the
Court was constituted, was concluded. Fifty-
seven prisoners were arraigned, of whom nine
pleaded guilty, although they were warned by the
Attorney-General—not by the Court—that, their
offences being capital, they were simply noosing
the ropes round their own necks. One by one,
they told him they were quite aware of the fact;
that it, indeed, was the very purpose for which
they were there.
“What,” as one of the wretches put it with
respect to himself, “ did he (Mr. Attorney) think
he (the prisoner at the bar) ’ad been up to his
little game for, if it wasn’t to get ’ung? Was he
(Mr. Attorney) fool ’miff to s’pose that he (pri-
soner) was a-goin’ to put himsel’ to th’ trouble of
killin’ gang-constable Dickens, if he ’ad nothink
else in view but a longer time under nigger-driver
Darrell yonder, and ”
Here the Attorney-General, not the Court —the
Court was apparently counting the flies on the
rafters—ordered the Clerk of Arraigns to accept
the plea, and motioned the prison-constables to
remove the fellow with the other eight to await
sentence.
With these nine we have nothing to do here.
They were very ordinary offenders—killers of
warders, fellow-gangers, and so on. We shall be
present at their hanging next week, but in the
meantime may dismiss them.
The prisoners pleading “not guilty ” numbered
48. The bulk of these were the members of D.
Gang, or the tramway team, concerned in the
emeute which had occurred on the evening of the
Commandant’s Picnic Party,* when the attempt
was made to destroy the guests by dropping the
tramway waggons down the height, and with them
were arraigned two or three other convicts sus
peoted of being parties to the plot. The trial of
the Gangers and Knatchbull for mutiny and con-
spiracy to murder was to be the piece de resistance
of the week’s banquet of blood.
You remember Tappin? Tappin, the member
of D. Gang, who had foiled the conspiracy— w ] 10
had saved the lives (at the imminent risk of losintr
his own) of the Commandant and his guests, and
the scores of other lives which would have ’been
sacrificed had the convicts gained possession of the
Island. Tappin, the English ex-Mayor. \V e ]j
Tappin was indicted as one of the conspirators. It
was all very well his interfering at the eleventh
hour, but then why didn’t he report the plot in
advance?
You also remember Knatchbull—John Knatch-
bull, former Post-Captain in his Majesty’s navy’
Knatchbull, the arch-villain, who had plotted the
conspiracy ? Well, Knatchbull was also indicted
But he was quite easy in his mind, was this
elegant expert of crime. Life had still 80me
attractions for him, and would never cease to be
attractive while it yielded him opportunities to
scheme and betray. And he had determined not
to hang this time. He had a little document in
his possession which he was quite sure would pre-
vent that undesirable consummation to his career.
Tappin and Knatchbull were not ranged with the
others in the dock. Their lives would not have
been safe in the menacing company of their fellow-
conspirators. They stood by themselves—with a
soldier between them.
After the business of the indictments, the jury,
men were sworn in. Here the first hitch in the
proceedings occurred. The gentlemen available
for the jury were one short of the required number
of five.
Both N.S.W. and Y.D.L. at this time enjoyed
that inestimable blessing—-a Jury Law, which pro-
tected even the humblest citizen from being
hanged, except with the consent of twelve of hi s
peers. As, in the nature of things, there was
virtually no civil population on Norfolk Island
from which to select a jury, the Special Commis-
sion had, by Act of Legislative Council, been
authorised to fall back on the old expedient of a
panel of military officers.
But Lieutenant Budgeon, for his share in the
chapel tragedy, had been placed under arrest by
Major Atchison, and Iris confinement to barracks
had limited the officers who could be drawn as
jurors to four only. The Major-Commanding was
exempted by regulation, and besides, military
duties would absorb his attention, while his sub-
ordinates were trying the prisoners. Thus the
senior-captain, the junior-captain, Lieutenant
Browning and Ensign Chick, who had just arrived
by the brig from Hobart Town, were left to con-
stitute the jury.
Scragge, the Civil Commandant, who, of xmrse,
controlled the procedure, tried to solve the diffi-
culty by soliciting the Major to free Budgeon from
arrest. “ It’ll stop the proceedings, I’m afraid,
Major, if you don’t. I can’t go to trial with a
jury of only four. After all, the chapel business
was purely accidental.”
Now the Major was like the majority of military
officers, who hated the System—till they were
given remunerative positions on the Civil side!
At present, belonging purely to the Military
Establishment, he had no hesitation in poking a
little fun at the Civil authorities.
“ What is the annual expenditure per head on
your convict strength, Scragge ?”

bals answered, and said unto him, “ By no means,
it is delicious with salt and pepper.”

dance.” Now, isn’t the ptcropus a strict vege-
tarian? We always thought he lived solely on

A London journal points out that Bells
Like and the old Weekly Dispatch were ruined
owing to their owners leaving them charged with
the annual payment of certain fixed sums. Owing
to the “ vested interest,” they could not cope with
the opposition that cropped up, and after a time
neither paper brought in enough revenue to pay
the charges, while those to whom they were lei
were reduced to poverty.

“About £13,” replied the C.C., wondering what
the question had to do with the jury difficulty.
“ Eleven times 13 equals 143,” said the Major.
“Yesterday’s affair saves you £143 per annum,
Scragge, as it took eleven men off your ration-
sheet ; but it cost my side money.”
“I don’t understand how,” rejoined the 0.0.,
suddenly.
“ Sixty-three rounds of cartridge were fired off,
weren’t they?” quoth the Major, pleasantly.
‘ ‘ Now, if I didn’t put Budgeon under arrest for
falling asleep on duty, I should be compelled to
do so, for wasting Her Majesty’s ammunition.
No, I can’t let him out, and you must do the best
you can for a juror. You can hang ’em as well
with four, as with five, Scragge. I shouldn’t have
thought you were the man to be troubled with a
punctilio of that kind.”
The Commandant glared, but thought after all
that the suggestion was not a bad one. Why
shouldn’t a jury of four do ?
Possibly the panel would have been confined to
four, had not Counsellor Jock, a regular gallows-
lawyer, been one of the D. Gangers’ prosecutors at
the bar.
The case of conspiracy was the first called for
formal trial—and the alleged conspirators were
arraigned at once. “Lumping the lot” would
save so much time ! The four jurors were sworn,
and the Clerk of Arraigns demanded from the
prisoners how they pleaded. From about forty
throats came a hoarse “Not guilty!” From one
(that of Jock) “I refuse to plead;” Three—
Tappin, Knatchbull, and another —had not opened
their mouths.
“ Who declines to plead ?” asked the Clerk.
“Me—John Saunders. I say, yer ’Oner, yer
must hev a jury o’ foive.
His Honor the Commissioner looked at the
Attorney-General for guidance. How could it be
expected that he should, unassisted, settle points
like that ?
The Attorney whispered to Mr. Scragge ;
then ;
“The Commandant informs me, your Honor,
that no more than four jurors can be obtained. I
submit we can proceed, in that case.”
“No, yer can’t. lobjeo’; ’tain’t legiff,” ejacu-
lated the Counsellor. “If ol’ Scragge, there,
wants to ’ang uz, let ’im do it leg-wdy. I don’
min’ so lon’s ev’rythink’s done legally, an’ in
order.”
“Your Honor, I ask for the protection of the
Court,” cried Commandant Scragge. “If this
prisoner is allowed to outrage me in this way unre-
buked by the Court, the whole Island will be in
revolt to-morrow.”
“ Oh—ah—to be sure !” said the Court. “ What
would you suggest, Mr. Scragge ?”
“To have him gagged—l know the fellow, your
Honor —he’ll make my life unbearable with his
tongue, and will interrupt the Court.”
“ Well, Scraggie,” grinned Jock, “ if I did make
yer loife unbear’ble, ain’t it only wot yer’ve done
to mine ?”
After the latter grossly-insubordinate observa-
tion, there was only one thing to be done. John
Saunders, alias “ Counsellor Jock,” was gagged in
open Court. Outside the Union Jack waved, and
in its flauntings boasted of the omnipresence of
British Justice. Outside, in the deep gullies of
Mount Pitt, were still lingering echoes of the
mid-day salute which had been fired in honour of
the Prince of Wales’ Birthday. Inside, a Court
of Justice, conducted by authority of Her
Majesty’s Commission. Inside, one of Her
Majesty’s subjects on trial for his life—gagged !
Not figuratively gagged, please you, as many a
man had been before, and has been since, by
ignorance or the forms of laws, but literally and
actually gagged with six inches of iron piping.
Hardly had the excitement caused by this mode
of deciding points of law—it took eight police to
fix the tube—settled into quiet, before the Rev.
Theophilus Eord suggested a solution of the diffi-
culty.
“I think, your Honor, if you would accept me
as a juror, the prisoners won’t object.”
“Mr. Eord !” exclaimed Chaplain Taylor, ter-
ribly shocked.
“Oh, never mind, Chapl’n,” grinned Johnson,
leader of D Gang. “If the Parson wishes, let
him. He’s been beak, an’ ounst’ble, and if he’s
jury, there’ll only be two more billets for him to
fill—flogger an’ Jack Ketch !”
And Parson Ford was sworn in as fifth juror.
The Court then adjourned till next day.
* * *
Tuesday, 10th November. The Attorney-
General opened the case at length against the con-
spirators and then the evidence for the Crown was
taken. The material testimony was of the cir-
cumstantial and inferential order, and not direct.
The fact that the D Gangers had simultaneously
loosened their hold on the chains to which were
attached the trucks containing the Commandant
and his guests, and had thus endangered the lives
of Hie party, was sworn to. Such validity as the
evidence possessed rested on this point, which was
proved by Drs. Grocott and MThail.
Two convict-wardsmen of D Gang were put
forward to swear they had overheard the Gangers
plotting.
In the enforced silence of Counsellor Jock,
whose blistered jaws were still distended by the
gag, Johnson cross-examined the last witnesses.
Prisoners had been cited to appear at the Court
of Special Commission, with their counsel, but a
citation in these terms was merely one of the
System’s little jokes. Excepting Mr, Attorney,
the nearest available lawyer was 1200 miles
distant. The prison population included two or
three ex-barristers and several solicitors, but as
their names were not on the current Law List
they would not be permitted to practise. British
Justice ever demanded that the robes of its officers
should be immaculate.
“Yer know, don’ yer?” Johnson asked of
Wardsman No. 1, “that D. Gangers are all
‘Ringers ’ ?”
The man replied affirmatively.
“ Yer know, too, don’ yer, that * Ringers ’ never
talk ’bout their little games when anybody’s by
who’s not one o’ th’ sosi’ty ?”
“IbTieve so,” said the Wardsman, who, the
Counsellor” being “shut up,” had reckoned
upon going without cross-examination.
“ Well, are you a ‘ Ringer ’ ?”
Eor the man to have said yes would be to put
put himself down as a participator in the crime
who had turned Queen’s Evidence, and he would
thus expose himself to a death more fearful than
the gallows. To be Queen’s Evidence was to be-
come an Ishrnael of Ishmaels, and to have raised
against him every felon hand in the Island.
On the other hand, were he to say the truth and
deny that he was a member of the horrible organi-
sation, it would be an admission that he had lied
when he had testified to overhearing the plot.
This much was known of the “Ring ” : Its leaders
never met for “business ” without setting guards
and pickets. No man who was not a “ringer”
could get within 20 feet of the spot where the
principal demons were brewing their hell-broths
without detection—and dying the death to which
the Ring doomed all who spied on its proceedings.
The witness remained silent, and nothing would
induce him to reply to another interrogatory from
Johnson. At last he was ordered to stand down.
A salvo of groans rose from the prisoners.
His co-perjurer, having deposed with great ful-
ness of detail to the conversation which he swore
he had heard, was also asked two questions only
by D. Gang leader.
“ When did yer hear me a-plottin’ wi’ Gooch
and Jook Saunders ? How long afore th’ picnic
was it ?”
“Tuesday afore th’ picnic,” said Wardman
No. 2—one Chuckem—stolidly. He was prepared
for the question.
“What time?”
“ Afore breakfast.”
Johnson said that was all. His fellow prisoners
looked disappointed. It was just as easy to prove
this witness a liar as the former, and yet their
leader hadn’t done so. They could not under-
stand it!
Not for long, however, were they left in doubt.
Johnson’s policy was made clear to them the
next morning when the case for the defence—save
the mark ! —was entered open.
# * *
Wednesday. Saunders was without his
gag when the court opened. Nevertheless, speech
was impossible to him, so swollen were his tongue
and lips. “Three or four hours of the tube-gag
inflicted exquisite torture,” Bishop Willson said
once to a Committee of the House of Commons.
“ The Counsellor ” had nearly 48 hours of it. But,
thank Heaven ! British law never tolerated
torture!
Each of the prisoners in alphabetical order was
called in for his defence. Had they any witnesses
to call ? Most shook their heads—others looked
at Johnson —Johnson, Tappin, Knatchbull, and a
fourth whose name hasn’t come down to us—cried
“ Yes !”
“Your witnesses?” said the Clerk to Johnson.
“Super. Darrell.” “Yours?” to Tappin. “Mr.
Scragge and Mr. Taylor. ”
“Yours ?” to Knatchbull. “ Civil Commandant
Scragge.”
We should say here that it was only under pres-
sure from the military officers that Knatchbull
was charged with the crime at all. He had not
been present when the trucks dashed down the
incline, but one of the officers had got some
inkling of the truth, and had threatened that if
Scragge did not indict Knatchbull, he would refer
the matter to Hobart Town.
“Yours?” to the fourth man, whose name has
not been recorded.
“ God !” answered the fellow—not reverently,
not sadly, but jeeringly. A terrible cachinnation,
every accent a blasphemy, went up from the dock.
* * *
Darrell, Super, at Lougridge, was examined
by Johnson. Respectful unto politeness was the
manner of the Demon’s questions.
“ When a man at Longridge Barracks wan’s to
see th’ docter, sir, what time does he report sick ?”
“Your Honor, I object,” said Mr. Attorney.
“This question can have no relevancy to its
charge.”
“ You’ll withdraw thet objeeshun, Attorney, or
else th’ Ring’ll vote your death !” There was an
unmitigable defiance and certainty in Johnson’s
words, and Mr. Waring turned pale.
Perhaps the only men who, not knowing what
the Ring was, did not fear it, were Mr. Darrell
and Chaplain Taylor. One secret of the awe it
inspired was that it never issued a fiat in public
without its being obeyed, the instrument of
obedience often projecting itself from the most
unlikely quarter.
The objection was not pressed, and Mr. Darrell
answered, “ Six o’clock in the morning.”
“ When does D Gang breakfast?”
“Seven o’clock.”
“ Then, a pris’ner wantin’ to see th’ croaker ’ud
be at Outer Shed at seven o’clock, and not at
breakfast.” Reluctantly, Mr. Darrell, who now
understood the drift of the question, said “Yes.”
Then, if Convict-Wardsman Chuckem was
waitin’ to see th’ doc., he’d not be at breakfast,
’ud he ?
“No!”
“Now, Mr. Darrell, sir, where’s your list o’ men
waitin’ to see th’ Croaker on Tuesday afore the
picnic ?”
“ The book’s at Longridge, I didn’t know you
wanted it.”
“I ax th’ Cort to ’journ till thet book is got, said
Johnson, with a glint of devilry in his eye.”
“I don’t think I can,” said His Honor the
Special Commissioner; “ ah—the case has taken —
ah —too much time already, you know. You
should have given notice to produce, prisoner.”
“Not me, sir; I know a dodge better’ll that.
I wasn’t a-goin’ to give Mr. Darrell time to alter
th’ book. Yer see, yer ’Onor, I knows Darrell
and th’ System.” So saying, he opened his
jacket, and from the bosom of his shirt drew the
book labelled “ Men waiting Doctor’s call,” which
Super. Darrell thought was in his rack at Long-
ridge. How he had got it no one could say ; but
there it was. His application for an adjournment
was part of the jest.| (
“Now, Super,” said Johnson, sternly, handing
him the book, “ Wasn’t Chuckem a-waitin’to see
the doctor, thet Tuesday ?’’
“ He was.”
Mr. Chuckem, in short, being a liar, and with
all the liar’s proverbial brevity of memory, had
forgotten he had reported sick, but Johnson re-
membered the circumstance.
Even the Special Commission couldn’t accept
Chuckem’s silence after Johnson had driven home
his point.
Johnson addressed the Court. Eloquent in the
vocabulary of the gaol, and with an ample com-
mand of gallows-rhetoric, with flashes of Vol-
tairean satire lighting up a phrase here and there,
with an occasional gush of fierce invective drown-
ing his utterance, he spoke for an hour. Spoke,
in fact, till the Court (acting on a pencilled note
sent by Rev. Juror Eord —“The jury are feeling
tired, your Honor”) gave him five minutes to con-
clude.
“ So yer see, yer ’Onor,” he said, as he finished,
“ thet there ain’t no conspiracy. There ain’t been
proved no collushun. Th’ Crown evidanse as ’ud
hev proved collushun broke down. All thet th’
croakers proved was thet we all drop’d our rope-
an’ th’ chain at th’ same time. Wot’s thet worth?
It’s not as if they’d heard a word o’ command to
let go an’ us all obey it? An’ luk ’ere, sir—th’
trucks were so he’vy loaded, thet day, thet goin’
down ’ill, sir, they ran ’way from us. Includin’
’th waggons th’ tramway team is supposed to pull
only four ton. But there was more’n thet”—
“If your Honor thinks the point of any im-
portance, I’ll call fresh evidence to show the
weight of the trucks was less than usual,” said
Mr. Attorney.
“Certainly,”Mr. Attorney, exclaimed the Court
(who was dozing).
“Yes, there was more’n four ton. There was
ol 1 Scragge there—he’s a ton o’ virtue himself an’
a ton o’ intellek besides; then, there was ol’ Grocott
—a whole ton o’ lamin’, sir, an’ a ton o’ pom-
possity, also. That’s four ton. There was little
McPhail—a full half-hunderd o’ nothink, an’ th’
ladies a ton o’ b’uty each on ’em, ’cept ol’
Scraggy’s sister, an’ she had two ton o’ hugliness
all to her own cheek. How many ton’s thet, yer
’Onor ?” laughed the wretch.
# * *
Thursday, the farce proceeded. Ribaldry
in the dock, drowsy imbecility on the Bench,
played their respective parts splendidly. Outside,
a thousand voices of earth, and sea, and sky,
telling of the glory of God and the witchery of
His handiwork in physical nature ; and inside,
Death playing dice with Justice, with human lives
for counters.
It came to Knatchbull’s turn to be put on his
defence.
“ I submit, your Honor, there is no case against
me.” Indeed there was not. Not a word had
been said in evidence to show this wretch’s partin
the conspiracy. Commandant Scragge had taken
care of that.
When Scragge had set Knatchbull to prepare
for the picnic, he had given him this pass, never
thinking, of course, Knatchbull would use it for
any other purpose :
Office of the Civil Commandant,
Sep., 184—.
The prisoner named in the margin
John Knatchbull, is permitted at large, and to have
per Asia (2) No. access to all wards and gangs, for
3219 purpose known to the Commandant.
Signed Edgar E. Scragge,
C. C.
When the emeute failed, and Knatchbull’s share in
it had leaked out, he had told Scragge with un-
mistakeable plainness : “ If I am indicted, sir, my
defence will be that I planned the outbreak by
your orders, and I will produce your pass in proof.
‘A purpose known to the Commandant’—what
is that, sir, but the preparation of a plot and its
betrayal ?”
Scragge had no objection to a trap being set for
prisoners, hut to be accused of ordering one to be
laid was a different thing; so, failing to procure
the return of the document from Knatchbull, he
had arranged that though he could not prevent
Cap’n John from being indicted, yet the case
should fall to the ground.
When it became plain to the rest of the prisoners
on trial that Knatchbull would escape the fate
that was palpably overshadowing them, they
became maddened. They did not fear death, but
Knatchbull did, and they knew he did ; and they
would have died a score of times to ensure his
dying before them so that they might gloat on
his agony. Moved by a common impulse when
Gooch tried to strike Knatchbull from behind the
dock-railing, they lifted him over the bars, and in
a second Gooch’s fingers were knotted in Knatch-
bull’s throat. Oap’n John had never been so near
his end as he was that moment.
All through the golden summer’s day from ten
to five o’clock the D Gangers were addressing
the Court. A score and more of speeches ; some
mere repetitions of Johnson’a, others ornate with
obscene blooms of a decidedly original mould,
filled the dreary hours. The soldiers who guarded
the Butcher’s Shop seemed, to theinflamedimagina-
tion of Chaplain Taylor, a vidette on the out-
skirts of Hell. Once, twice, and thrice had ho
gone to the door, as though to remind himself
there was a Heaven to aspire to —for his faith
wavered as his senses sickened.
* * *
On the Friday morning they had so far
progressed that only Tappin and two or three
others remained to address the Court. Tappin
called the Civil Commandant as a witness.
Scragge went to the box and said before he was
sworn : “I don’t see that any evidence I can give
will do the prisoner any good.”
“ I’ll chance that,” said Tappin. “You know
I saved the trucks from going down hill, at the
risk of my life?” A groan from the dock.
“ I know you stopped the trucks,’’said the C.C.,
with a measured insolence, as ff the other element
of the question merited contempt:
A hiss from the dock. The D Gangers might
hate Tappin as the man whose heroism had de-
prived them of their revenge ; but they could not
riide from themselves that Scragge denied the
heroic character of his deed.
Now came a question that shocked even the
Court.
“You have my conditional pardon in your
possession ?”
The witness staged, flushed an angry red-won
dering in his mind how the prisoner knew— nn !i
stammered : “Yes.” oa
“ When did it arrive here?”
“Why? (The witness had recovered his self
possession.) Why, by the last'brig. But I con u
not issue it pending your trial for this offence ” °
“ You lie!” said Tappin. “My pardon arrived
the trip before last. Liar-thief-you stole m
liberty ! My pardon was in your possession heW.
1 was put into D Gang—before I became a devil
ion didn’t know—lll admit—but vhy? v*’
were too drunk to open your despatches,' Si— 1 ]
down.” Stung into a madness that could imt
articulate, but could only froth at the mouth th
Commandant obeyed.
“Mr. Taylor,” called Tappin, and the Chanlain
went into the box. , 1 n
“Mr. Taylor,” asked Tappin, “ would you mind
deposing to what you told me in hospital?”
Briefly. Mr. Taylor said he had received hv
the last brig (trip No. 39) a letter from recently
discharged Convict Zedekiah X , No. GOOfi
enclosing a cutting from the Hobart ' Town
Gazette of 7th August, announcing the urnnti,,!.
of a C.P. to W. E. Tappin, No. 18909, per Gowi°
nor Ready, and stating that the writer had seen
the pardon among the despatches received bv Hu,
brig, trip No. 37.
“lt :
's a lie,” shrieked Scragge, who had amm
ently lost all discretion. “It’s a put-up (him?
between the d parson and his pet Tappin.” '
Chaplain Taylor said: “It was not my inten-
tion to have the letter read, but I will now hand
it to the Court.”
“I don’t think this has anything to do with the
case,” said Parson Eord from the jury-box.
Mr. Attorney-General Waring interposed with
a grave dignity. “It is for me to object, or his
Honor. (His Honor was meritoriously doing his
best to keep awake.) The point is of importance
If the Pardon was here before the date of the
offence charged in the indictment, and the offence
was committed with a view to obtain the freedom
illegally withheld, I question much whether the
charge will stand. I may now say that I have a
distinct recollection of the Pardon to Tappin
being registered in Executive early in August-
and the document should have arrived here
anterior to the date of the alleged crime. With
your Honor’s permission I shall withdraw the
charge against Tappin, pending submission of the
circumstances to the Chief Justice.
A rolling .cheer from the dock, and cries of
“Scraggy, there’s a knock for you, ol’ pal.”
“Hello, Com’dant, how d’ye feel arter that
stiff’ner ?” and so on.
Order was restored. The Commissioner, voting
the whole thing “a demmed bor,” was smacking
his lips in anticipation over the cool claret waiting
in the ante-room, and was about to adjourn
when—
“Yer ain’t called mv Witness,” exclaimed the
nameless prisoner. “ Call on God, and arsk Him
what He thinks o’ this ’ere bisness.” Then,
changing his tone from a jeer to a bitter sincerity’
and flinging his arms out to the length of the
straps which held them to his waist-iron, he cried ;
“ God, O Great God ! If Thou art there answer!
What thinkest Thou of this ?”
His gesture, in the intensity of its passion, was
like the swaying of a sceptre. The room hushed
into a tragic silence. Every man held his breath
as though waiting a response to the invocation.
For half a minute there was no sound heard,
and then chaplain Taylor, bending his head on his
chair-arm, sobbed—heart-brokenly.
* * #
Saturday wound up the awful week.
There was a shameful—no, a shameless-at-
tempt at a summing-up on the conspiracy
case. Prompted now by the Attorney-
General and Parson Ford, the Special Com-
missioner somehow got through his task, at
the conclusion of which he directed the jury to
acquit the prisoner Knatchbull. Then, before the
verdict of guilty on the great charge Vvas announced,
three other cases involving the capital penalty
were heard, as was also the remainder of the re-
cord, consisting of a few paltry offences, such as
assaults and robberies. One of the former was
the charge against Edward Hogan for the murder
of a co-worker in the bricklayers’ gang. Hogan
was the prisoner whose order for discharge had
been altered by Prison-Writer Convict No. 6006
to secure his own release.
# # #
The sentences were pronounced after night-
fall. The Court had adjourned while the Special
Commissioner, the Attorney-General, the jurors,
and Mr. Scragge consulted as to the respective
penalties. Twenty were left for death. Tappin’s
case was reserved for the decision of the Chief
Justice.
While the deliberations were being proceeded
with, Superintendent Darrell took Johnson out
and gave him 25 lashes for “ having a volume of
official reports illegally in his possession.”
“Darrell, yer might as well hev made it fifty,
ol’ man,” gasped Johnson, as he was hustled
back into the dock, after flogging. “This lot
brings my so re up to nineteen-hunderd-an’-
seventy-five. ’Nother twenty-five ’ud hev made th’
count an even two thousan’. Yer last chance’s
gone, Darrell, for I ’ang on Monday.”
