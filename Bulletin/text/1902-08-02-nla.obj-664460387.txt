[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
Cradled in the silent night,
Life is sweetly sleeping ;
Longing makes the darkness bright,
Love his watch is keeping.
Bound about me come and go,<j|
Ghosts and spirits lonely,
Yet I linger here below,
Faithful to thee only.
Gracious maiden, hearest thou ?
Why so long delaying ?
Liest thou in slumber now,
Deep in dreamland straying ?
Nay, thou movest not in dreams,
For my spirit, yearning,
Thro’ thy curtain sees the gleams
Of thy lamp, still burning.
Ah ! so glance thou, child most kind,
From thy window bending ;
Softly ! how the evening wind
Sweet with song is wending.
And the wind shall truly hear,
Bear my thoughts above me,
And shall whisper in thine ear,
Where thou art—“ I love thee.”
When the earnest lover sings
True love listens, waking ;
But the night to morning wings,
I your rest am breaking.
Slumber till the morning light
Breaks in day the clearest;
Until morning, then—Good night 1
Good-night, thou, my dearest!
AHAU.
A Hundred Years After.
JULY 24tli was the centenary of Alexander
Dumas pere ; born at Villers-Cotterets, on
July 24, 1802. The French are fond of
celebrating centenaries. A few months
ago they solemnly made obeisance to the memory
of Victor Hugo. To-day it is the turn of Dumas.
Next year George Sand will be exhumed to be
extolled. These occasions are useful for stock-
taking ; and, when an author is not only remem-
bered but seriously feted a century .after coming
“out of the everywhere into here,” it goes far to
warrant the conclusion that he really is a fixed
point in the sky, not a meteor blazing for a
moment between nothingness and oblivion, nor a
mere rocket, ineffectually shooting towards star-
hood.
The best way of honouring an author is to read
him. Another way is to imitate him. Dumas is
both read and imitated. Millions have enjoyed
his romances; scores have copied his methods.
If he has kept many readers delightfully awake,
he has also enabled many authors comfortably to
sleep. What are the Stanley Weymans, what
were the Harrison Ainsworths, but Dumas-
ketiers ?
The genius of Dumas was the consequence of a
singular blend of bloods. His grandfather married
a negress, and his father was born in San Domingo.
He was never wholly civilised. There is a bar-
baric note in all his books and plays, whilst over
some of them the trail of the splendid savage is
deeply impressed. The Titanic energy with which
he produced is without a parallel; this, with his
utter lack of artistic conscience, his Bacchic scorn
of the conventions, his reckless prodigality and
his deep-hearted joyousness, were endowments
that, like the fluid within his veins, came of his
Equatorial ancestry. The soul of the man was
sun-burnt.
; His father was like a character from one of
Dumas’ own romances. He was a General in the
Republican army which, in face of immense odds,
magnificently held France for the French against
all Europe in the days that followed the Revolu-
tion and prepared the way for Napoleon. Promo-
tion was by merit in those days, and father
Dumas was a General 20 months after he had
enlisted as a private. At the age of 30 he com-
manded a French army in the Tyrol. His feats
as a soldier are only casually mentioned by
Alison (“History of Europe,” 11., 495), though
he acknowledges that by the successes of General
Dumas in capturing the Mont Cenispasses “ the
whole ridge of the Alps separating Piedmont from
Savoy fell into the possession of the Republican
Generals, and the keys of Italy were placed in the
hands of the French Government.'’ But D’Ar-
tagnan never did finer things in battle than did
the father of the novelist—or accQinplished mar-
vels by more novel means. He took Mont Cenis
by assault. Some defences had to be surmounted.
“Arrived at the palisades, the soldiers began to
clamber up;. but,” records the son, “ in} 7 father,
thanks to his Herculean strength, found a simpler
and less noisy plan, which was to take each man
by the seat of his trousers and by his shirt-collar,
and to throw him over the stockade.” One cannot
imagine a modern British general doing a thing
like that; it is not provided for in the Army regu-
lations. Single-handed at Clausen, the Creole
Horatius held the bridge against an Austrian
regiment.
Dumas tried hard to be a classic, and succeeded
in spite of his own efforts. That sounds like a
paradox, but it is no more than the truth. He
wanted to write tragedies like Corneille. He
might as well have endeavored to write another
“Paradise Lost.” Had Dumas attained his
ambition, and produced pieces true to pattern, he
would not have been the Dumas we know
—the original, swift, headlong man of genius,
whose pages are cataracts of incidents whipped
into the froth of passion. To imitate the
classics is an excellent occupation for second-
rate men; it is essential to fail in that
object, and to realise an original self in the
attempt, in order to be a first-rate man. M.
Hippolyte Parigot, the latest French critic of
Dumas, aptly cites a story. A monk, on a fast-
day, when fish was the orthodox fare, had a plump
pullet placed before him. It was savoury; he
was hungry. “In the name of Bacchus, Comus
and Momus, I baptise thee carp,” said he and
fell-to. The earlier works of Dumas are romantic
pullets, though he might baptise them classical
carp. He even tried to give a religious tinge to
some of his plays—he, Dumas, did ! The critics
condemned “ Caligule.” He said they did so
“ because it contained a great deal too much piety
for the rogues.” He introduced Mary Magdalene
as miraculously converting one of the young ladies
of his tragedy. That from Dumas, who, had he
known Mary, would have so injured her reputa-
tion as to put it beyond reparation, even by a
cart-load of Papal benedictions ! Dumas’ pose as
an apostle tickled Thackeray, who said: “We
have people in England who write for bread, like
Dumas and Sand, and are paid so much for their
lines ; but they don’t set up for prophets. Mrs.
Trollope has never declared that her words are
inspired by Heaven ; Mr. Buckstone has written
a great number of farces and not talked about the
altar and the tabernacle. Even Sir Edward
Bulwer . . . never ventured to say that he had
received a Divine mission and was uttering five-
act revelations.” But Dumas was capable of all
that, while his life was a prolonged orgy. In
France, it was not usual to start new religions, or
he would have done so ; and ho might even have
claimed that the D’Artagnan romances were
revealed to him by the Virgin Mary.
But the plays ol Dumas, if still read, -are no
longer a force in the theatre. They had their
vogue as part of the romantic movement in which
Hugo and Gautier figured. They fill 25 volumes,
and are full of entertainment, adultery, assigna-
tion, assassination and machination. He kills six
people in the first act of one play, after which
there is a fatal duel, an agonised death by poison-
ing, and a resurrection of the ghosts of numerous
slaughtered victims. It is all very lively, though
Thackeray found the dramas of Dumas “pro-
foundly immoral and absurd.” His plots are
marvels of ingenuity. The carpentering is su-
perbly done, but the characters are nearly all
villains. The man with a Divine mission never
converted his own puppets. Somebody once said
that Dickens never created a gentleman. Did
Dumas, whether in play or novel, ever create a
character who was not more or less of a black-
guard ? Some of them do gentlemanly things
occasionally, but that is another matter. One
admires the delicate tact of Henry of Navarre
(“Marguerite de Valois”) in pretending not to
notice anything when he knows that his wife has
a lover—M. de Mole, a fascinating rascal —con-
cealed in a cabinet in her bed-chamber. But then
Marguerite knew that he had a key to the apart-
ments of the fair Madame De Sauve on the
next floor of the Louvre, and was kind enough not
to mention that-either. There must be love and
let love in these matters.
In Ins fiction Dumas essayed to do for France
what Scott—whom he acknowledged as his master
—had done for Britain, to depict the past in a
series of vivid romances, Certainly he had imagi-
nation enough, but he had absolutely no concern
for historical veracity. Scott’s romances are the
works of an antiquary and a scholar. He knew the
periods in which he worked. It is true that in a
note to “ Ivanhoe” Scott denies that “ the author
of a modern antique romance is obliged to confine
himself to the introduction of those manners only
which, it can be proved to him, absolutely existed in
the times he is depicting, so.that lie restrain him-
self to such as are plausible and natural, and con-
tain no obvious anachronism.” But Dumas cared
no more for anachronism than a polar bear cares
for the Sphinx, whilst Scott’s departures from his-
tory are generally warranted on the ground of
giving verisimilitude to the story or the breath of
actuality to the character—just as a painter might,
in a historical canvas, represent a leading figure in
a blue cloak instead of a red one to suit the colour-
scheme of his composition. Undoubtedly Dumas
took pains to inform himself, both by original
research, and by paying—or owing—others to
search for him. He freely stole from scandalous
memoirs, aud cribbed from the chroniclers. But
all he wanted was a few pegs upon which to hang
the fabric which he spun from his own teeming
brain. Rarely does he arrest the flow of his romance
to describe, as Scott does, with such fulness of
knowledge and fond enthusiasm, a historical
scene and its accessories. Bishop Spratt admirably
said of the learning of Cowley that “it was not
embossed on his mind but enamelled.” So was
Soott’s ; but that of Dumas was just “ washed in,”
as the artists say.
In “The Three Musketeers” he makes Milady
speculate that D’Artagnan “ is going to transport
her to some loathsome Botany Bay, some infamous
Tyburn of the Indian Ocean.” As the action of
the novel takes place before the middle of the
seventeenth century —it opens in 1625 —and Cook
did not discover Botany Bay till 1770, Milady was
unduly anticipating an infliction for this country,
which has produced enough evil females of its
own. To Botany Bay likewise, in hi# play of
“ Kean,” Dumas represents the Prince of Wales
as about to transport the eminent tragedian, who
gallantly rescues an innocent maiden whom Lord
Melbourne endeavors to abduct. There is a great
quarrel between the Prince and Kean in the
theatrical dressing-room of the latter. Kean
insults the Prince, who exiles him as aforesaid,
but graciously commutes the decree to one of
banishment to New York, where the actor marries
the lady himself. Perhaps the most audacious
thing Dumas ever did in the way of turning history
Upside down, was in his account of the overthrow of
Charles I. by Cromwell, in “Twenty Years After.”
It is a delightfully hopeless mix-up; one of the
wildest pieces of invention that ever romance set
to paper. It is delirium tremens history—but it is
an exciting story. Those who want the actual
facts can get them from Gardiner, but they will
be more entertained with “Twenty Years After.”
For downright wickedness the women of Dumas
are unmatched. He did paint a few decent
women, but his gallery includes a collection of
females the most cruel, ferocious, deceitful,
lying, lustful, lewd and luxurious who ever wore
petticoats and fondled lovers. Take the women
of his “Marguerite de Navarre.” Except the
King’s mistress, Marie Touchet, who is a tender,
harmless, little figure, all the rest —queens,
princesses, court ladies and waiting wenches —
are strumpets to a woman. Shakespeare’s worst
woman. Lady Macbeth, is a saint in comparison
with some of them; and Dumas’ worst, the Queen-
mother, is a loathsome ogre, to whom torture is a
joy, murder a relaxation, and adultery a tame
device for passing away the time.
But say the worst of Dumas, and he still re-
mains the most fascinating of story-tellers. His
very recklessness is part of his charm. If one
wants sober history, there are the serious his-
torians, in their conflicting schools, eaeh accusing
the other of doing insidiously what Dumas did
without a blush. His practices were dubious. He
employed a corps of “ gentlemen ”to write scenes
which he invented, just as some of the great
artists of antiquity, like Titian, employed others
to paint in portions of their canvases. He was
the architect —why should he not have his hod-
carriers and his stone-masons? Thus, presum-
ably, he would have argued. So that the story
rushed through the volume, dodging in and out
among the side-plots, or so that the rivulets that
he started flowing in his opening chapters met
and gathered in the confluence of the narrative at
the proper point, the style could take care of it-
self. He must have enjoyed his work as he en-
joyed his life—and that was as reckless as his
work. “ They say I have been extravagant, he
said to his son in his dying hours. “ Yet 1 came
to Paris with only a Napoleon in my pocket, and
see,” pointing to the shelf, “I have one still!
With all his faults we could spare many a great
teller of tales before we could spare him who told
of Monte Cristo, and who sent swaggering across
the world the clanking figures of Athos, Porthos,
Aramis, and D’Artagnan.

“The true test of art is sincerity,” saith John
Ruskin, and proceeds to glorify some very crude
paintings and some very naive literature. Well
if sincerity is art, welcome to the ranks of men of
letters George Bradley, of Half Ounce, Grey
Valley, M.L., whose book of poems, “Richard,
the King of New Zealand,” is obviously thoroughly
sincere, full of the serene sincerity of the ancient
anchorites who lived on a locust or two a day and
a sprinkle of water once a lifetime, in the trust
that such things were for blessedness and Eternal
Life. What man, if he were not sincere (so sincere
as to have that absolute atrophy of the sense of
humor which is the test of genuine, 24-carat
sincerity) could write and publish this ;
PRAYER.
Oh, God guide and guard all those that roam,
Guard and guide our Premier home ;
Guide o’er our mighty main
To rule o’er once again.
Guard him back to New Zealand ;
Rule him with Thy Mighty hand ;
Watch o’er him where e’er he goes,
And banish all his bitter foes,
Amen!
And this again of Kingßichard’s visit to England
on the occasion of the Diamond Jubilee of Queen
Victoria ( verb, et lit.) :
Ohobas— Oh, that knelt-before the throne,
And saw the Pope of Rome
We can thank our Dick
That’s now landed home.
They talk about the Rulers—
We let them talk away,
I say we have the champion
Ruler of the day.
When I read in the papers
All seems like a dream,
That our noble Dick
Should kneel before the Queen.
Ohobas —Oh, should kneel before the Queen
It seems like a dream,
That our noble Dick
Should appear before the Queen.
“The Prayer” printed above, was sung by the
composer at a banquet given to King Seddon at
Greymouth; the poem from which we have
quoted was written to the tune of ‘ ‘ The Wearing
of the Green ”by the bard—a simply pathetic cir-
cumstance, since “The Wearing of the Green” is
the only song of which Mr. Seddon knows the
music, and he is therefore able, without the trouble
of adding to his musical education, to sing the
noble paean to himself in moments of relaxation.
This bard of Greymouth inspires us with great
hopes of poetry in Maoriland ; he has the first
essentials of great writing—sincerity and a simple
purpose. Will not the rest come in time ?

Ambrose Pratt (who is just now in Sydney) has
secured through his literary agent in London a
very good contract for a series of short stories.
“A.D.”: “Jef’s” experience with “Henry V.”
(B. 12/7/’O2) recalls a somewhat similar experience
during my Adelaide Matric. The Odes of Horace
were among the Latin text books. Our unco guid
preceptors (following the virtuous example of Mr.
Gladstone) religiously ignored the last stanzas of
the first ode (Bk, iv.). In the exam, we were set
the complete ode for translation —but we did not
share Jef’s discomfort. I think every candidate,
male and female, gave a better translation of the
last portion than of the first, so that out of evil
came good.
Henry Lawson arrived in Sydney last week,
having hastened his departure from London on
account of illness. Lawson is suffering much from
nerve trouble,- and is now under medical treatment;
but the bright skies of sunny Sydney should soon
set him up again.
Some Correspondents—
F.J.B. writes: “A.P. (Red Page, 5/7/’O2) says that
Nietzsche, in * Also spraeh Zarathustra,' evidently bor-
rowed largely from Blake, but that he had not Blake’s
sane physiological basis, so landed himself in a lunatic
asylum. What is this cant about the breakdown of
Nietzsche’s intellect? He paid the penalty of intense
over-work, just as Swift or Scott, or Paschal, not to men-
tion others, paid it before him. Blake, on the contrary,
was never sane. He was born mad. What is the mental
condition of a man who draws the picture of the soul of a
flea, and who plays at Adam and Eve with his wife in a
summer-house in ‘ the altogether’ ? But the whole thing
is absurd. Blake is hardly known to his own countrymen,
and he is certainly less known to cultivated Germany than
is Nietzsche to. cultivated English speakingdom. Lamb
was the first to make literary allusion bo Blake, and folk
treated Lamb’s appreciation of him as something not
altogether to his own intellectual credit. Swinburne
made Blake known in more recent times ; but even Swin-
burne’s wild worship has not succeeded in making Blake
known to more than curious students of the by-ways
and back-alleys of literature. Nietzsche’s attitude towards
English literature and English thought is one of pro-
nounced contempt. Also he was very honest. Of all to whom
he owed an intellectual debt he made full acknowledg-
ment. He never spoke of Blake, and probably would have
treated the mention of his name as referring to a noted
English admiral of a long-past day. When ‘ A.P.’ wants
to class Blake with any other writer, let him take
M‘Don aid Clarke, the mad poet of America."
Christopher Crisp (returning to the subject of “Im-
perialism and Democracy ”): The “ big American Repub-
lic ” is a despotism plus rings, and has no real national
existence or dignity. The “little Swiss Republic is
merely a municipalised Edinburgh: The “ great French
Republic” is at the mercy of any Boulanger on a black
horse, and it lives on its Napoleonic glories, its Legion of
Honour, and its ancient nobility. Its feverish adulation
of the Russian alliance shows how keenly it feels its
plebeian forlornness as a bar sinister Republic. Great
Britain, in spite of the banalities (and worse) of many of
its monarchs, is at the head of civilisation now, distinctly
and solely because of the beneficent and magnificent
potentiality in every corner of the world of its system of
responsible government under the Crown.
(Which is an excellent illustration of the fact that one
can prove anything—even the non-absurdity of a monarchy
—if one is allowed tfo ignore all facts. Certainly, if the
American Republic has “no real national existence or
dignity ; ” if the Swiss Republic (which has rolled back
from its borders time and again the armed hosts of
Empire, and has given to the world priceless examples in
the preservation of Liberty, and the designing of
Federal Government) is a mere municipality ; if the
French Republic (which did not fall before Boulanger
on a black horse, nor yet before all the forces
of priests and soldiers conspiring together for its
destruction) lives on its ancient nobility—its proscribed,
dispossessed and absolutely worthless ancient nobility ;
then certainly Republicanism is a failure, and hereditary
monarchy the One true principle of Democracy : also the
sun circles round the earth and is eaten up by a dragon
every night.]
To W. : None of the “ steals ” you cite has any present
interest, and most of them are not proved cases.
W.G.W. : Not a single newspaper gave the late Brunton
Stephens’ birthplace correctly. There is no such place in
Scotland as Barrowstonness, but there is a well-known
dirty hole of a place called Bo’ness, or Borrowstonness,
on the Firth of Forth. There is also a neighboring shanty
village named Blackness, both contiguous to Lord Hope-
toun’s lordly domain.

A Lesson Worth Learning
Hsepatitis and Dyspeptic Misery:
11 A BLESSING TO WORK & LIVE,”
The Case of
Mrs. B. EAGAR.
(For the 'Redfern Times.)
It is impossible to read the following
statement of the condition of things de-
scribed by Mrs. Bertha Eagar, of No. 145
Walker-street, Redfern, without being
struck by certain phases and facts in her re-
cital. Carrying her memory back eleven
years, Mrs. Eagar said :
“ It is that length of time since I was re-
leased from a complaint of such great ob-
stinacy that there was every reason to think
I would never be the same woman again.
Why I say this is because my sufferings ex-
tended over a period of six months or
more, and half that time I was under the
care of a doctor.”
“ What complaint was he treating you
for?” asked our reporter.
“ My ailments were as numerous as they
were difficult to cope with, but I am of
opinion that they were occasioned by a dis-
eased state of my liver. Be that as it may,
I know that indigestion was one of the prin-
cipal features of my illness, and I became so
seriously affected by it that before long I
was a completely helpless invalid. When I
had been taking medicines prescribed by my
physician till I knew it was useless to drink
any more I did not know what to do next,
for I was so feeble that I could not walk
across the floor. It seemed a cruel thing to
throw so much money away, and waste so
much time for nothing, but when people are
ill, you know, they will spend their last
penny, if necessary, in-buying things which
they expect to do them good. And that is
the very reason why I consider it my duty
to divulge to all mankind the fact that it
was only through using Clements Tonic at
the eleventh hour that, my awful sufferings
were checked. Through reading a kindly-
disposed person’s testimonial I started tak-
ing if, and ever since those w-ords appeared
before me I have regarded them with as
much respect as though they had consti-
tuted a message from an angel above. When
I come to consider how much agony I en-
dured I am devoutly thankful that the right
remedy came at last.”
“ Was it after eating that you felt so
ill ? ”
“ Well, if you like to call it eating, it
was, but my appetite was so very quickly
appeased that I could not take even a
moderate meal. Two or three mouthfuls of
light diet were always enough, and then the
most unmerciful pains in the chest started.
Had you beheld my anguish you would have
been moved, as the suffocating sensations in-
duced such desperate efforts to get my
breath that an onlooker would have feared
I was going to choke. A fearful state of
weakness was brought about, and I was
compelled to lie down the greater part of
the day, my household duties, of course,
being out of the question so far as I was
concerned. A dreadful aching pain settled
across my brow, as if its mission was to
destroy all the pleasures in life, and it cer-
tainly succeeded, for I felt cheerless and
careworn beyond expression. This state of
things was bad enough in the day time, but
when I hid to go through the same horrors
it night, for the want of sleep, my sorrowful
condition can be imagined. Gradually the
tlesh wasted off my bones, and in the mean-
time my skin changed to a pallid hue, while
ilia weaker I got the more my limbs ached.
My lips and hands were as white as if my
flood had turned to water, and when I
•aised my head I became quite giddy. If I
tried te walk upstairs I felt so dazed that I
•ould not go two steps alone, a strange mist
flso appearing before my eyes, which nearly
lways felt swollen and weak, as if I were
offering from a severe cold. Acute pains
truck me between my shoulder-blades, too,
while the aches across my loins were as pain-
ful as they could be. My mouth was never
free from a taste as bitter as gall, and there
was a sticky substance over my tongue
which I could never wash off, these two ad-
verse elements combined making me con-
tinually feel sick.”
“How did your nervous system bear up
against all this ? ”
“Very well for a time, and then my
nerves gave way quite suddenly. The least
excitement produced a fit of trembling, my
mind also being agitated on the slightest
provocation. But, so far as that goes, my
brain always seemed to be in a restless state,
for if I got an hour or two’s doze, it in-
variably meant that I had some kind of ugly
dream, the recollection of which frightened
me on awaking.”
“ You certainly had very little comfort in
life at that time, Mrs. Eagar.”
“ There was really nothing left for me to
live for, and the melancholy thoughts with
which I was seized through my heart pal-
pitating very badly made me heartily sick
and tired of everything ; but when I read
about Clements Tonic I thought I might at
le <st get a little better if I tried it, and I
think my present appearance speaks for it-
self. When my recovery began it was by
acquiring an appetite through the use of
Clements Tonic, and already that medicine
had done me more service than all the other
decoctions put together, because there was
an inward sense of comfort after my food
which told me that digestion was being pro-
perly performed. Ido not wish you to be-
lieve that this wonderful amount of relief
came instantly, because such a thing, con-
sidering the plight I was in, would be im-
possible, but it was certainly the speedy and
direct result of taking Clements Tonic, and,
moreover, I was soon sufficiently eased from
headaches and pains to admit of sound
sleep helping me towards the goal I desired
to reach. The medicine I was taking suited
my complaints splendidly, as the fearful
pains in my chest diminished as each dose
of Clements Tonic was taken, while flatu-
lence and giddiness were remedied quite
mysteriously. Drowsiness and despondency
were wafted away by the medicine, which
was likewise bracing together my shattered
nerves, and its regulating powers had a
beneficial effect which I have enjoyed up to
the present day. My skin soon became
clear and bright, which that
Clements Tonic had a more powerful in-
fluence over my Llood than any physic I had
hitherto purchased, and the unpleasant taste
was altogether removed from my mouth. It
did not take a great deal of Clements Tonic
to rid me of those wearying aches which had
come upon me through excessive weakuess,
and when they were gone there was nothing
tb stop me from doing my housework with
as much activity and cheerfulness as ev r.
Indeed, it was a blessing to work and live,
for before my last bottle of Clements Tonic
was finished I was well and sound in every
respect, and not one of my old ailments has
troubled me since. A lesson like mine
should be taught all invalids, so you can
publish these words in any way you
choose,”

Strength restored
after Illness
A mother’s interesting letter about
her little daughter
Here is a case of a little child who had
bean suffering with fever and a complication
of ailments which had reduced her system
to a state of extreme weakness. The way
she was restored to health and strength is
told in the following letter: —
“ Fire Station, Brooke Road,
“ Stoke Newington, London, England,
“ October 21st, 1900.
“Gentlemen, —I have great pleasure in
writing to thank you for the great benefit
our little daughter of four years old has
derived from taking Scott’s Emulsion. In
February last she was stricken down with
fever, followed by congestion of the lungs,
pneumonia and abscesses, which held her
between life and death for some days. A
4m
I
f
MARJORIE SARGENT.
(From a photograph.)
friend recommended your Scott’s Emulsi n.
which she has been taking for some mouths,
and it has certainly been the means of
restoring her to health and strength. She
is now looking well and strong.—l am, yours
truly,
“ (Signed) Agnes Sargent.”
Scoit’s Emulsion certainly deserves the
praise it receives from those who take it.
It is a standard preparation of cod-liver oil,
and has more us s in the human system
than any other remedy which is offered to
the public. Scott’s Emulsion has overcome
all of the objections formerly urged against
cod-liver oil. It is perfectly palatable, so
that it is not objectionable to the most
sensitive palate, and it does not tax the
organs of digestion.
Scott’s Emulsion gives the system strength
and vitality. It is a specific for coughs,
colds, and all ailments of throat and lungs,
and in addition to the properties of a
specific, it offers the most vital principles
of food in the easiest form for absorption
into the blood. The result of taking Scott’s
Emulsion is an increased appetite, better
digestion of food, renewed strength, and
vigour in all the vital organs.
Scott’s Emulsion must not be confounded
with other forms of cod-liver oil, for it is
peculiar to itself, and differs from any other
preparation. The only way to derive the
benefits which we are revealing from day to
day by the publication of letters from those
who have tried our preparation, is to insist
upon having the genuine Scott’s Emulsion,
which is easily distinguished by our trade
mark of a man holding a big fish over his
shoulder. You will certainly be well paid if
you will be careful to buy only the genuine
Scott’s Emulsion, for the merits of this
preparation are well known both to the
medical profession and to the public.
You can obtain a sample of Scott’s Emulsion
by sending fourpence to Scott & Bowne, Ltd.,
483 Kent-street, Sydney, and mentioning this
paper. All chemists sell Scott’s Emulsion.

Hear the whisper of hopeless things in this time
of the twilight pale,
Told by the tongues that cling to the wings of the
drowsy eastern gale,
Sobbing the story of broken life, beaten agains*
the dust,
Of eyes that dry in the lonely years, and lips set
hard to the crust.
Come out, oh, heart, from your drowsiness, and
know of the hearts that beat,
The march of the dead in the milking-shed, to the
clatter of creaking feet.
’Tis a long, long way in a cruel day over a hope
less track—
And this is the word of the driving wind, the crj
of the man out-back.
There came a lie in his golden youth ; full-blooded '
and fair he went,
And drove his strength on the eastern hills, and
dreamed in the midnight tent.
The whistling gums fell back at the stroke, ti e
slab roof dared the sun,
Till the strong soul smiled in the summer bush for
a weary work well done ; <
He took her away from the olden home to the roo f
on the chestnut rise,
And side by side thro’ the hard day tide they
labored with streaking eyes. i
Oh, the load is sore to their shoulders now, the I
hot brain heaves a wrack—
God keep a place in His halls of grace for the soul) '
of the folk out-back !
When the red cows died at the black well-side
and the locusts clanged in the ferns, i
She lay face fair to the steaming roof and gave tr
the world her bairns.
With never the soothe of a tender hand, but his
for the wrenching pain,—
Who cares that the brown mouth smiles no more ’
—for the hand’s eternal stain ?
She eats her sup with a bended head, and sips the
dregs set-faced,
And the bitterness bites her heart to dust, the late
bairn cries at her waist.
Oh, the children come and the children stay, the
dam goes black and black—
But the sword of the Lord is hard to the necks of
the folk in the toils out-back !
The gulch yawns black to the purple sky, no sign
of the dawn-stain yet,
The candle gleams from the misty panes where
the meagre meal is set.
The red chains clank in the early dark, and dry
eyes blink and stare
To the East and curse for the laggard flush to
waken the dawn out there.
And shuffling feet in a weariness go out ’neath the
morning star,
That winks white lights on the looming ridge, to
the deeps where the cattle are.
Stifle and sweat, come dawn and dark, no matter
what life may lack,
From the reeking sheds to the hungry fields go
the makers of worlds out-back !
They ravish the shrines of the olden land till the
hidden ways are plain,
Bare-breasted and clean to the summer sheen, and
wait as they may for rain ;
While the fever-limbs of a drought that swims in
the ring of a merciless sun
Writhe down and choke in scourging smoke the
last blades, one by one.
The old man hopes in a frowning Fate, and plans
in the steaming dark ;
And the old wife turns in a restless dream, ashake
from the dingo-bark.
Oh ! a twisting wrench tears out his heart, still
brave, tho’ the lean lips crack,
As he lists the sigh of the bairns near by, worn
old in the years out-back.
This is the whisper of hopeless things, of strong
souls shadow-pale—
The sorrow of people that fashion a world, told by
the driving, gale.
What would you have for the axe that led straight
in the pathless ways
By giving the best of the upland plains a gift tc
the future days ?
What for the women of faith, bowed, brown, worn
lean in the merciless years,
Who willed their lives for the sake of him and the
children they bore in tears ?
)h ! the praise is slow on the way they go, yet
the Lord God knoweth the track ;
Vtayhap He keeps in His halls of grace a rest fo>
the folks out-back.

C. L. RIVERS.
If there is any shred of truth in Queens-
land Premier Philp’s pathetic yarn about the
danger of landing the returned Kanaka on his
native island, and the necessity for bringing him
back to Queensland to save him from his savage
acquaintances, it would seem that many years of
missionary effort in Polynesia have been a failure,
and that it is time to cut off the stipend of the
useless and inefficient preacher. Australia has
suffered from vast quantities of information about
the good that was being done in bringing the
brown man to a knowledge of the desirability of
putting his cocoa-nut in the plate on Sunday.
To be told now that he is such a murderous
wretch that his own returned brother often dare
not land is a surprise; and Premier Philp’s demand
that the anti-Kanaka law be set aside in order
that the time-expired brother, after one affrighted
look at his family waiting for him on the shore
with the cooking-pot in its hand, may come
straight back to the Queensland plantations, is a
shock. Somebody must be lying. The idyllic
picture of the church with its thatch of palm-
leaves, and the native preacher, and the glossy
I brown choir, told us nothing of this.

SATURDAY, AUGUST 2, 1902.
A Lesson from Argentina.
The Argentine spectre was roused again from
its sleep, if it ever does sleep, by Sydney
Telegraph’s article of 21st July, entitled
“ A Comparison.” Argentina is, of all the
world, the one new country which presents the
closest resemblance to Australia ; therefore
it has become customary for Tory papers here
to seize themselves violently by the collar
and ask themselves in a terrible voice ivhy
the Commonwealth is almost stationary while
the Confederation is rapidly going ahead ?
And then they answer their own question
by stating that the malign influence of the
Labor party is responsible, and that our only
hope lies in developing our “national
resources”—by which the Tory paper always
means growing wheat in desert land, and
growing sheep where sheep only die of thirst,
and making railways with borrowed money
to enable people to go into the desert where
nobody w T ants to go, and to carry out there
the goods the handful of local inhabitants
can’t buy, and to bring away from there the
things they haven’t got to sell. As Sydney
Telegraph sorrowfully puts it:
Jin Australia we possess many advantages, real and
assured, over our growing South American rival. We are
far richer in minerals ; our wool is the finest in the world.
We have facilities for borrowing money and importing
capital such as Argentina cannot rival. Yet, strange to
say, while our Governments continue to borrow, the
influx of British capital is checked as far as private enter-
prise is concerned. Since the crisis of 1893 the amount of
British capital employed in Australian banking, and in
the development of the resources of the land, has been
reduced by very many millions, because the openings for
it have been restricted, and the hazards much increased.
There was a considerable advance in agriculture amongst
us after the crisis, for the reason that the JGovernments
were not in a position to compete in the labor market,
and because the country offered more attractions than
the towns. Now, Australia has once again succeeded in
making the towns more attractive than the country, and
production is on the down grade. Yet, are we differ-
ently situated from Argentina, where the President
comes forward and points _ out to the people that
they must “always bear in mind that agriculture
and the pastoral industry are their main sources
of wealth?” True, we can add mining to the list, and
mining appears to be the only point at which Bntisn
capital can directly take the field in Australia, though
there is a pause just now, and the tariff will further
check it. But where is the opening either for the immi-
grant or for imported capital at the present time . if
there is any important work to be executed, the dominant
party in the Legislatures resents anything outside
Government construction. Does that benefit labor, or
starve employment? It evidently does not offer any
inducement to the immigrant, because he does not
come ; and the present exodus to South Africa does not
suggest that the Australian himself derives much benefit
from the condition of affairs.
* • * •
“ Where is the opening for the immigrant
in Australia 1 ” It is a fair question. If the
British farmer, driven out by his country’s
Foreign-trade policy, wants to find a new
home, he might go to Germany, for instance,
where, even if he had to pay away three-fourths
of his wheat crop in rent and taxes, he would
have as much left for himself as he would in
Australia, taking the average return of all
the wheat lands of this country, even if he
got his land here fornothing. He could goto a
comparatively barren land like Sweden, and
if he paid away more than three-quarters of
his wheat crop in rent and taxes, he would
still have as much left for himself as he would
have in Australia, taking the average crop in
each instance, if l(e got his land here free
and paid no taxes whatever. He could go
almost anywhere and get better returns than
he can get in Australia —the only reason why
he doesn’t go almost anywhere more fre-
quently than he does is probably his ignorance
of foreign languages. Under these circum-
stances why should he come to Australia ?
If he wants to raise sheep and cattle—this is
the only sheep and cattle country in the
world whose flocks and herds have perished
wholesale, and which, even in good average
years, receives less than 20 inches of rain
over nearly three-fourths of its area, and less
than 10 inches over nearly half its area. In
such circumstances why should the pastoral
immigrant want to come to Australia, any
more than the agricultural immigrant '(
Even on these dry lands the agriculturist
might scrape out a decent living if he was
producing merely to supply a great Austra-
lian manufacturing population at his own
doors, but when a large portion of his scanty
crop has to pay freight and middlemen’s
charges to a market 16,000 miles away,
where is the inducement ?
* * * 9
As to why artisans don’t come here —the
workers in steel, iron, brass, tinplates,
woollens, cottons, linens, silks, machinery,
and so forth—the reason is obvious enough.
There are no great industries to employ
them, and there can’t be while the Common-
wealth States import £41,000,000 worth of
goods annually from outside, and while their
narrow cult of Foreign-traders persuade the
people that the greatness of a nation is
measured by the greatness of the amount it
imports, and, consequently, the smallness of
the amount it produces for itself. While
Australia takes pride in the sneers of its
ignorant G. Reid and its uncouth Pulsford
and Pumpkin Smith at the obscurity of the
first beginnings of its new industries, it
isn’t likely to offer any inducements that
will attract an influx of artisans. They are
no more likely than agricultural immigrants
to come here, except by the same foolish
mistake that took the New Australians to
Paraguay. As a matter of fact, Australia
never had any great genuine immigration,
except in the first flush of the gold
boom ; and in those glorious later years when
it was floating the first big loans and finding
employment for almost everybody on public
works. Here is the real record for the six
Commonwealth States:—

Thegold-boom broughtthegreatinflux of 1851
to 1860 ; also, in these days, the supply of
good land was still far from being exhausted,
and much land was still being given away to
whoever asked for it. But even in the best
of the gold days Australia bought an immense
proportion of its immigrants. The influx of
after years was mostly based on a flashy and
artificial prosperity produced by the influx
of borrowed money. Here is the beautiful
record for the last three decades :

. * * * *
Immigration practically ceased when the
alluvial gold boom ended, and when Aus-
tralia ceased to pay the passages of its
immigrants, and to present them with a
respectable estate on arrival, and when the
influx of loans wore off a little, and they were
no longer sufficient, as in 1881-1890, to sup-
port half the population. Yet all this influx of
outside money might perhaps have done more
good than harm if it had been invested in
self-supporting industries that would have
obviated the necessity for importing. If a
foreign capitalist came here with £1,000,000,
and took away £250,000 a year in dividends,
still, if his industry enabled the country to
supply itself with some much-needed article
of which it used to import £1,000,000 worth
per annum, the country would be £750,000
a year better off. But of the loans, about
£60,000,000 went merely to avert the ne-
cessity for taxation, and £150,000,000 went
in works that don’t pay interest on their
cost, and almost the whole lot dribbled back
to Europe in payment for imports, and after
all this debt had been acquired the country
was nearly as dependent on imports, and
quite as devoid of any permanent employ-
ment that could possibly attract immigrants,
as before. The insane pride of the cult to
which Pulsford and Reid and M‘Millan
and Pumpkin Smith belong, in the scarcity
of local industries, and the consequent
necessity for immense importations, blocked
progress everywhere. Even the States
which made a half-hearted attempt at Pro-
tection had the same superstition in a less
degree —the superstition that people should
be driven out into the desert at any cost to
pursue the natural industry of growing wheat
on the hobs of Gehenna, and that a huge
trade—the sending away of raw material
that we can’t manufacture for ourselves for
want of big industries to employ capital, and
the importation of manufactured goods that
we can’t produce ourselves for lack of works
to supply work and wages to labor—is pros-
perity.
* 9 * *
Capital doesn’t emigrate here now any
more than labor does, and the reason why it
should be so is very easy to find. The Free-
trade paper has a comforting illusion that
it is because the Labor party insists on
having the £5OOO job of making a new road
done by day-labor, and won’t allow private
enterprise to build a certain lone and
solitary bridge—that over Sydney Harbor
—that great enterprising millionaires don’t
settle in Australia, but, as a matter of
fact, large capitalists never go to any
country that takes such an insane joy in
imports, unless it is a country with a tem-
porary gold boom on hand. The only reason
why they should want to come here and
stay here is to start large manufacturing
industries ; there is nothing else for them to
do that holds out any prospect of permanent
profit. They can’t do that unless they sup-
ply locally some of the demand that is now
filled by imports and thus reduce importa-
tion, and when they see the Senate cutting
down one duty after another on the ground
that it will reduce importation they under-
stand that this is a country which doesn’t
want local industry—that importation is a
disease. Canada, which helps on its indus-
tries with almost prohibitive tariffs, has
between 600,000 and 700,000 workers in its
factories against the Commonwealth’s less
than 200,000, and it certainly does attract
immigrants. It doesn’t mind if it knocks
“importation” endways so long as it sup-
plies abundance of local employment. Argen-
tina began its boom with the Protective tariff
of 1878, and the factories of the city of
Buenos Ayres alone turn out as much value
in finished goods, according to Mulhall’s
estimate, as the factories of Australia,
Tasmania and Maoriland put together ! ! And
about the flow of immigrants into Argentina
there can be no doubt whatever. Argentina
supplied the work by artificial means and
the people came. Australia started at the
other end. It artificially acquired 650,000
people, dating from the beginning of assisted
immigration (they have since, counting in
their children, increased to one or two
millions) by buying them, largely with loan
moneys, under the assisted-immigration
system, but having conscientious scruples
about taking any artificial means to
supply them with sufficient permanent
employment, it keeps a great portion
of them alive out of loans. And its futile
Freetrade press finds comfort in assuring
itself that the whole trouble arises somehow
out of the conduct of the Labor party, or is
owing to the machinations of the Jesuits, or
something equally shadowy.
Local Mis-Government.
It is just as much a maxim of scientific democracy
that no constituency Bhould be wider than the
area governed as it is that no constituency
should be narrower. If in N.S.W. only
one-fourth of the adult population is allowed
a voice in governing the State, it is bad govern-
ment. Also, if in N.S.W., the city of Sydney
is governed as to many of its purely local matters
by the constituency of the whole State, it is again
bad government. Manhood suffrage (with its
coming complement of womanhood suffrage) has
now put the State Government on a fair demo-
cratic basis. But there is as yet hardly a serious
suggestion that local government should be ad-
ministered on the same sound lines. The people of
Sydney are not allowed to govern themselves as
citizens in purely civic relations, but have to sub-
mit to be ruled in part by the people of the whole
State as regards local matters ; and the people of
Bourke, and Booligal, and Bathurst and Bega are
in the same or worse plight. It is inevitable that,
under such a system, the cities and towns suffer,
and the whole State suffers. If purely local
affairs are administered by purely local bodies,
then the consequences of mal-administration and
error, having purely local consequence, will be
promptly felt and rectified ; or if not rectified the
local community continues to suffer, and deserves
to. But if Bathurst is partly governed as to its
local affairs by N.S.W., and mistakes are made,
the consequences are felt by Bathurst, but
not by all N.S.W. and the chance of prompt re-
dress is slight. Bathurst continues to suffer,
but doesn’t necessarily deserve to. The wrong,
the responsibility, the redress should be, in all
matters of Government, intimately connected.
When they are not, when one party can inflict
the wrong, which another party has to suffer,
misgovernment must follow.
* * * *
The case of the city of Sydney is just now a
good example of this. Sydney is allowed to
govern itself to the extent of sweeping its streets
and collecting its garbage. In most other matters
it is governed by the State Cabinet through
Boards, or by private monopolies through
Acts of Parliament. Its water supply, for
instance, is in charge of a Board of Water
Supply and Sewerage, which is to all intents
and purposes a creature of the Government,
and is ruled by a derelict politician of the Parkes
days, who was made its President after the electors
had found him unfitted for further public life.
And this Board, lest the process of the education
of its members by their professional servants
should in time make it a fairly effective body, is
constantly hampered and stringhalted by the
State Cabinet. The Board, even in minor
matters, merely reigns while the Owe’Sullivan
governs; and the eye of the Owe’Sullivan is
naturally fixed more on the electors of Queanbeyan
and the Labor Caucus and the chance of getting
the Premiership than on the necessities of
the city of Sydney. Hence, in part, the pre-
sent threatened water famine, which, should
it come (and there seems every prospect of
its coming), will almost ruin the city. If the
people of the metropolitan district at next munici-
pal elections could deal directly with the persons
responsible for ,the fact that a citizen can’t now
take a plunge bath or water his pet roses, and has
to think seriously of the time when he will not be
able to even flush his drains, probably some-
thing notable would happen. But they can’t.
The people responsible are Mr. G. H. Reid, who
appointed Mr. Jacob Garrard as President of
the Water and Sewerage Board, and Mr. Owe-
Sullivan and Mr. John See who add to the
inefficiency of that Board by hobbling it; and a
hundred and one other persons to whom the
municipal electors are as nothing. Similarly the
people of Bathurst suffer annual typhoid epi-
demics because the State Government persisted in
selling them a water supply pumped from a mud-
hole, and the State Board of Health insisted that
there was no harm in allowing piggeries to be
kept in the close vicinity of that mud-hole ; and
these wrongs were inflicted, not by persons who
are responsible to them and can he punished by
them, but by persons who are responsible to the
whole of N.S.W. and can only be punished by
N.S.W.
* * * *
Local Government would not cure all the abuses
of municipal government. Aldermen would still
be aldermen, and mistakes and scandals would
still occur. But this material step forward would
be gained : That those who did the wrong would
have to answer for it to those who suffered the
wrong. At present the people responsible for the
Sydney water scarcity and the Bathurst water
dirtiness are just as much responsible to
the voters of Hay and Armidale as to
the people of Sydney and Bathurst respectively.
Naturally, the man at Hay can’t work up much
enthusiasm regarding the Sydney man’s bath
limitations or the Armidale citizen about the
germs in the Bathurst water supply. So scan-
dalous misgovernment and maladministration go
unchecked and unpunished.
* * * *
N.S.W. Government will never become decently
efficient or decently honest until a comprehensive
Local Government measure has been made law.
The present system makes the citizen the victim
in his local affairs of the State’s muddling, and at
the same time makes the State treasury the prey of
every dishonest local member with a “pull.” It
is as expensive as it is inefficient, and secures the
least amount of good Government at the greatest
possible cost. The Labor party, when it comes to
recognise its duty, will have to link Local Govern-
ment with Financial Reform as the first plank of
its platform.
The Iron Bonus Bill.
Arthur Rae writes on the other side :
Under the heading of “ The Federal Anti-Labor Party ”
(12/7/’O2), you slate that party for moving the amendment
in the Bill giving a bonus on iron production. That
amendment confines the bonus to iron and steel produced
in State-owned works and completely bars the “ private-
enterprise ” syndicator. You base your denunciation of
the Labor party’s action on the grounds that the N.S.W.
State Govt, “did not intend to start iron works,” and
that the Party was well aware of the fact. That The
Bulletin is consistent in advocating Protection I admit,
but in barracking for protection to private enter-
prise, in opposition to State-owned industry, is most
amazingly inconsistent, in my opinion. Admittedly
a mere resolution, or even an amendment, in a
Bill will not create State iron-works ; but the action
of the Federal Labor Party paves the way for further
.action by the State Labor Party in the desired direction.
Apart from the constitutional point as to the power of
the Commonwealth to itself undertake the iron industry,
the fact that neither lands nor minerals are in possession
of the Federal authorities, while the States possess both,
compels the Labor Party to look to the latter to do the
work. The alleged fact that the State Government
“ does not intend ” to start ironworks need not trouble
us, if those who believe that the State should do so get
to work and force the hand of the State Government by
all possible means. The history of N.S.W. during the last
10 or 11 years is full of instances of things the State
Government “did not intend ” to do, but did all the same,
when compelled by democratic pressure to do or go. Old
Age Pensions, Arbitration Acts, and many other measures
on our statute books were the wild socialistic dreams of
a few years back, and one of the latest instances of the
things the State Government, “did not intend” to do,
but is now getting ready to do, is the establishment of a
State clothing factory. There are dozens of privately-
owned clothing factories against which the State factory
must compete in quality and cost, or be condemned as a
spoon-fed pauper industry. There are no privately-
owned iron-works producing the finished article from the
native ores. If the manufacture of uniforms worn by
State officials is a sufficient reason for running a State
clothing factory, then the tens of thousands of tons of
iron and steel required annually for our railways, tram-
ways, rolling-stock, bridges, and public buildings is an
equally good or better reason for establishing State iron-
works. If the enormous cost of the machinery and plant
of an up-to-date iron and steel works capable of supplying
the public needs of Australia, or even of this State, is
taken into account, it .rrfeans that the first syndicate to
commence, at once creates a powerful monopoly. Mono-
polies are admittedly dangerous alike to the political and
economic freedom of the people. By no Australian
journal has this been so ably and so persistently preached
as by The Bulletin.
* * * *
If State iron-works are good to possess, which is the
easier and the safer way to obtain them ? To create on
the one hand huge vested interests monopolising the
mineral wealth of the State, and subsidised by the whole
Australian people, in order to provide some labor for our-
selves and dividends for absentee shareholders, or to bend
our energies (even if the effort takes a few years to reach
maturity) in establishing State works which will give us
an equal amount of employment under probably better
conditions for the toilers, and retain the dividends in the
hands of the People, who create them ? Against this it
may be urged that to build State works by borrowed
money bearing interest is only paying dividends to
absentee money-lenders in another form, while the people
take the risk. This is only partially true, because no
syndicate will find the capital required unless it can see
its way to earn large dividends reaching probably 25 or
30 per cent., or even more. The State can secure the
money at 3£ or 4 per cent., or, allowing for all
costs and deductions, suppose we say 5 per
cent. That amounts to £IOO,OOO per annum on
a loan of two millions, which is admittedly
more than would be required to start the concern. A
syndicate starting with the same capital, obtained at the
same rate, and content with an additional dividend of a
modest 5 per cent., would drain the country of £200,000
per annum, and in spite of trades-unionism and arbitra-
tion courts, would probably pay lower wages, work longer
hours, and do much to imperil political liberty and pro-
gress by its far-reaching influence and immense wealth.
The only practical question at stake in determining which
is the better, State or private enterprise iron-works, is
whether there is a reasonable hope of getting State works,
established in the near future? I think there is. Mr.
Kingston says he will accept the Labor party’s amend-
ment and go on with the Bonus Bill. If made law, it
means that all the States will be assisting by the bonuses
paid, in bearing the risks undertaken by one State in
establishing a national industry on truly national lines.


By payment of the bonus all the Australian people will
practically become partners in the enterprise, and, through
the Commonwealth Parliament, will exercise a vigilant
interest in its management. The fact that the Taxdodgers
Union, the Chamber of Commerce, all the daily papers
and fat men, individually and collectively, denounce the
Labor amendment of the Bonus Bill, establishes a strong
prima facie case in its favor. Why The Bulletin joins
with this motley crew of Mammon-worshippers when its
weight on the other side would so powerfully assist the
party of true Australian nationalism I am at a loss to
conceive.
• • * •
To which The Bulletin replies in as few words
as possible:—
(1) N.S.W. and all Australia want some new indus-
tries very badly indeed. In N.S.W. it may be fairly
estimated that 12 per cent, of the population is just now
supported by the expenditure of loan-money, mostly on
non-payable works. The loan business, which was
originally for remunerative works, has degenerated into
a relief system which makes N.S.W. one of the boss
pauper countries of the earth.
(2) The Labor Party has held the balance of power,
and had a great say in the direction of affairs in N.S.W.,
for 10 or 12 years. that time its chief idea
in the way of finding more employment for the people
seems to have been loans and public works —more of the
old relief business.
(3) During most of that time it has been the friend and
agent of the rich absentee importing firms who seek to
restrict Australian industry because it would reduce the
demand for foreign goods.
(4) During all that time it has done its full share to
make this country the slave of the foreign money-lender.
It has been fugleman for the rich money-lending sharks
as well as for the importing sharks. It has been the
agent of foreign sweaters and slave-drivers inasmuch as
it was largely responsible for throwing open N.S.W.’s
ports to the goods of the sweater and finding him a
market here.
(5) It passed an Old Age Pensions Bill certainly, which
was a good and noble action—and it didn’t provide r
penny to pay the pensions with. It was instrumental in
procuring better wages for the railway employees—and it
left any deficit that might arise therefrom to be added to
the floating debt in the good old way. It allowed the
Reid Government to shamefully fake the public accounts,
and kept the Reid Government in power. It allows the
See Government to annex trust-funds (the rents of the
unpaid-for properties in the resumed area) as revenue,
and keeps the See Government in power. It doesn’t even
protest against these swindles. It helped Reid to cut
down the already insufficient revenue, for the benefit, in
a great measure, of a wealthy class, and winked at all the
deficits that followed. In finance it has been a Tax-
dodgers party pure and simple. And, to put the matter
shortly, The Bulletin has pretty well lost faith in the
N.S.W. Labor party as an organisation that will, under
its present platform and leadership, exert itself to run
any public enterprise on a honest basis. It hasn’t origi-
nated any swindles that this paper is aware of, but,, for
giving its support to the swindles of both parties, it is
unique.
(6) Further, The Bulletin is losing any faith it ever had
in the N.S.W. Labor party as a constructive body. It has
been, to a considerable extent, in power for the last 10 or
12 years, and the State Bank and the State Insurance
Office are where they were ; and the State Land Bank is
too small and obscure to amount to anything, and Local
Government is apparently no nearer, and so are most
other things. The idea of the Labor party doing any-
thing serious in the way of establishing great State iron-
works looked too remote to be worth gambling on. And
the chance of such works paying their way unless the
Labor party uses its influence to have them run a great
deal more honestly than the Sydney land resumptions
have been, looks still more remote. The See-Owe’Sullivan
Government would probably treat the receipts from the
works as revenue and charge most of the expenses to
loans, and the Labor party would look on.
(7) There is no proposal whatever to give any company
a monopoly in the iron business. Canada supports seven
or eight large iron and steel works. The idea of Aus-
tralia, with two-thirds of Canada’s population, being
able to support only one is ridiculous. As for the theory
that the proposed company would make 20 or 30 per
cent, dividends that is mere theory, and very improbable
theory, too.
(8) The proposed works might easily save the payment
of £l,ooo,ooo—perhaps £2,000,000—a year for imports.
If tile co. took away even £250,000 a year in dividends
(25 per cent, on a capital of £1,000,000) it would still
save Australia something between £750*000 and
£1,750,000 in payment for imports. A Commonwealth
that is borrowing about £1,000,000 a month to
keep the pot boiling, and to pay for its imports,
and to find work for its unemployed, wants to make some
saving of this kind, and to do it very promptly. N.S.W. has
waited nearly a dozen years for the Labor party to do
something towards finding work for the people in self-
supporting industries, and has found it voting most of
the time with the crowd that keeps down N.S.W. indus-
tries in the interests of English and German and
American manufacturers and foreign importers—with the
Reid Cash Basis fraud, and the See resumed area rents
fraud—and with the party that is selling Australia to
foreign money-lenders. And that party carried its point
on behalf of subsidised State ironworks by joining votes
with the importing gang which wanted to kill the
measure altogether—which is against every new industry
because it will interfere with its business as agent for
outside sweaters.
(9) As to why the Labor party should hang on to the
motley gang of mammon-worshippers which sells this
country to Cohen, the London money-lender, and sup-
presses national industries for the benefit of M'Arthur
and Co., of London and elsewhere, The Bulletin is at a
loss to conceive. For years The Bulletin has urged that
an effort should be made to shift the foreign banks, in-
surance offices, and loan corporations that take large
profits out of Australia without supplying any new
industry or new employment; to get a graduated land-
tax and an absentee-tax that would remove the A. A.
Co. and other great foreign land syndicates that have
made 30 per cent, dividends out of Australia without
furnishing work or wages for the people; to get a
State bank and a State note issue ; to make a beginning
at lifting the blighting mortgage of the foreign Cohen off
our railways, telegraphs, ’phones, water works, sewage
works, roads, harbors—our everything, in fact ;to estab-
lish our own industries and cease supporting the blood-
stained Carnegie in the U.S., and the softgoods sweaters
of London —these foreign importers who make far larger
dividends out of this country than the manufacturing
“ monopolists” of the most-protected Australian State.
And perhaps it was the N.S.W. Labor party’s blank
apathy in practice, if not in theory, as regards every
great national idea of the kind that prevented this
paper taking its State ironworks seriously. The first idea
that presented itself was that the party had gone back to
its old importing idol, G. Reid, and was killing the pro-
posed Australian industry in a devious fashion to oblige
him and the rich foreign importers who are behind him.
PLAIN ENGLISH.
M.‘Billion the Freetrader—again.
Following in the footsteps of Dry-Dog Reid, that
bounding importer, William M'Millan, has
been delivering an oration on the fiscal question at
Euroa (Victoria). The report states that Willtam
the Importer “compared the relative progress of
N.S.W. under Freetrade and Victoria under
Protection,” which is just what the cheeky little
man probably would do. M‘Millan was once an
ardent Freetrade Treasurer in N.S.W. He
heavily protected newspapers, bricks, beer,
apples, timber and woodwork of almost every
kind, bacon, hams, tongues, biscuits, blasting
powder, butter, candied fruits, candles, cement,
cheese, cider, cigars, tobacco, confectionery, corn-
flour, galvanised iron of all kinds, wire, jams,
jellies, lead-piping, preserved milk, sugar,
molasses, paints, salt, wine, and a number of
other things. He preached Freetrade, and he
gave a little Protection to almost every industry
that was going. He denounced the Victorian
protective duties, and his own protective duties
were, in some cases, heavier than those then
existing in Victoria. When his own theories
and his practice were set against each other
he was a shameless political hypocrite ; and the
fair assumption is that, either he didn’t believe
what he said when he declared Protection to be
wholly bad, or else he believed Protection was
bad, and he and Bruce Smith and others were en-
gaged in a villainous conspiracy to ruin, or at
least injure, N.S.W. In one sense he certainly
had his own reward. If he had advocated Pro-
tection he would have had to tax his own soft-
goods, and damage his importing business for the
good of local industry—and he didn’t advocate
Protection. If he had practised real Freetrade
he would have brought about such a wreck, and
brough t down on himself such unanimous execra-
tion from the heavily-protected Freetrade papers,
that he would have gone out of office, and a
Government that would have taxed his softgoocls
would have come in—and so he didn’t practise
Freetrade. He took care to have Freetrade as re-
gards his own imported softgoods, but.that was the
exception rather than the rule. Politically he was
a slanderer as well as a shuffler, inasmuch as he
denounced, scoffed at, and repudiated the policy
by which he surreptitiously made his political
living. Politically, he was also a thief, for he
stole the credit of the prosperity which attached
to his protected industries, and pointed to it as a
proof of the advantages of Freetrade. No one
man or one Government could have worked this
monstrous imposture. But the Freetrade Sydney
papers, in consideration of heavy protection for
themselves, backed up the political fraud. Thesemi-
Protective tariff, to which M'MiLLAN and Bruce
Smith lent themselves, was in force in N.S.W.
for very many years, and some of its Pro-
tective items were in force until the Federal tariff
superseded them. Many N.S.W. industries owed
their existence to that tariff.. Therefore, anybody
who points to the prosperity of N.S.W. under
Freetrade is just a plain, ordinary liar, for N.S.W.
never had pure Freetrade. The method of dishing
their opponents pursued by the N.S.W. Freetrade
leaders may have been smart politics, but it
wasn’t honorable, and the person who does such
things isn’t calculated to ornament the church to
which he belongs—if he belongs to one. Next
time M ‘Milt.an addresses a Victorian audience on
the blessings of Freetrade that Victorian audience
should ask him why he didn’t take his own
blessing when he had the chance.

A Hysterical Bishop.
Bishop Stretch of Newcastle (N.S.W.), has been
up in Northern Queensland, and has apparently
interviewed the class of people with whom bishops
and other large church dignitaries mostly asso-
ciate. He has come back full of fury at the
proposed abolition of Kanaka labor. For some
reason the Church is almost solid on the side of
cheap nigger labor. Probably its unconscious bias
nigger-wards arises from the fact that the brown
man is almost the only person nowadays to whom
the story of Jonah and the fish can be told in its
entirety without exciting laughter. He is almost
the only surviving receptacle for the complete
narrative of the ark and the deluge. He is—when
he finds a certain amount of “ religion ” —almost
the only person left who regards the preacher
man as a superior being, and who can be
patronised as my “ pore, humble brother.” At
all events, for some reason or other, the Church
has a decided cant in the brown man’s direction,
and is frantically illogical on his account. This,
for instance, is Bishop Stretch :
The nationalities of Cairns are decidedly mixed. The
Federal Government, with that rare courage which marks
truly great men, have fastened upon the most harmless
and (en parenth&se) the most unprotected for their special
fury. Chinese are there by thousands, and singularly
useful they are j Japanese also. But it is the Kanaka
that must go. These last seem singularly inoffensive.
They work hard at work no white man should be asked to
undertake (for it is deadly monotonous), are law-abiding,
quiet people, who spend their money where they earn it.
And many of them come under very distinct Christian
influence,' and live simple, pious lives. These men, many
of whom have wives and families who are really good-
living people, the enlightened Government insists upon
deporting to heathen islands where the chances are that
they will be murdered by their still-heathen countrymen.
A ‘more curious and cowardly proceeding it would be
hard to imagine. I trust that in some way Australia
may be spared the scandal of it. If not, a White Aus-
tralia will have to blush a pretty high-colored red
for very shame. It is curious that no plans for “ de-
porting ” Chinese or Japanese have yet been put forward.
It is not hard to see the reason. When we wish to play
the bully, we naturally choose the smallest boy. The
Kanaka only trashes and cuts cane, and loads it on to
the trucks. After that the work provides employment
for a large number of white men. Practically black labor
is little more than white man’s machinery, till something
directly mechanical can be invented and substituted.
Whether under these circumstances it is worth harassing
an important industry for the sake of a theory is surely
worth considering.
Bishop Stretch’s statement that he found Chinese
“by thousands” in a town which has less than
3000 persons suggests the usual unreliability of
the Church in matters of fact. His professed
inability to understand why the Kanakas were
fixed upon for expulsion great ignorance
of the subject, and a fixed intention not to study it
except from the sloppy standpoint of alleged Chris-
tian charity. The Kanaka is the most numerous
variety of colored objectionable—more numerous
than the Chinaman, and more than four times as
numerous as the Japanese —which is one objection.
He is about three times as criminal as the white
population, judged by the gaol statistics, which is
also a point against him. Also, he is much more
criminal than the Jap. Further, he came to Aus-
tralia under an agreement which provided for his
return to his native islands at the end of his term
of labor, and the Federal Government simply
proposes carrying out the agreement. It can’t
carry out any such agreement as regards the
Chinaman and the Japanese, for there is none.
The Kanaka doesn’t “only trash and cut cane
and load it on the trucks ” —not by any means.
That is an old yarn and a played-out Stretching of
the truth. But the most curious feature of the
story is that the Kanaka, when it is a question of
his remaining in Queensland to rear a half-caste
population and dilute the white race with a strain
of savagery, is “a singularly inoffensive indivi-
dual.” And almost in the next sentence it seems
that the Kanaka is a gory and howling savage, to
whom his own relatives dare not return for fear
of butchery. This is a large discrepancy. The
mere fact that the Queensland Kanaka may, or
may not, have heard, in a perfunctory way, about
Jonah, and learned to haunt the white man’s
public-house, doesn’t account for it. The Kanaka
on the islands has heard of Jonah also from the
missionary man. And there are many thousands
of Kanakas on the islands who have gone through
the Christianising process in the canefields and
public-houses of Queensland, and taken the mild
influence of the Gospel back with them. They
are all over the islands—these singularly inoffen-
sive Christians, and are now alleged to be scream-
ing on the beach, with an axe and a cook-
ing-pot, waiting for the return of their relatives.
Either Bishop Stretch wants Queensland to
take in a race of savages, whose influence must be
detrimental to the white inhabitants, or else it is
a case of sending the naturally mild, inoffensive
islander back to his mild, inoffensive friends
according to the terms of the original agreement.
Bishop Stretch can’t have both kinds of Kanaka.
Which Kanaka is he going to have ?
Tasmania’s Troubles.
A pressman on the spot (so far as there is any
spot) sums up the situation :
Tas. Treasurer Bird had not a very pleasant song to
trill in the local Assembly the other night. His deficiency
was £90,000 at the end of 1901, and is estimated at
£122,000 for 1902. Apart from the loss of customs revenue
through Federation, railway earnings have fallen off
£lO,OOO in the year as compared with 1900, producing
only o'Bs per cent, interest oncostof construction—and the
money to build the lines was borrowed at over 3£ per cent.
The West Coast lines, constructed at a cost of £350,000,
earned a profit of £13,000 in 1900, and only £2500 in 1901.
This is an eloquent testimony to the stupendous slump in
the silver-mining industry. There is also an indirect loss
through the partial squelching of “ Tattersall’s ” sweeps.
However, Treasurer Bird proposes to grasp the trouble
with both hands and square things up somehow. Expen-
diture is to be cut down by £33,000; the chief items
being the reduction of the Legislature to one House (or
two Houses sitting together), saving £4OOO a year ; the
lopping of the vote to charitable institutions by another
£4OOO ; compelling local bodies to either build their own
roads and bridges or go without, saving £13,000 ; and
“ miscellaneous ” expenditure to be reduced by £12,000.
Last year deadhead letters and telegrams cost a full
seventh (£9500) of the total postal revenue. Legitimate
departmental postages should not cost more than £5500.
So it appears that in a country where there is
no adequate payment of members the legislators
pay themselves by saving' stamps to the value of
£4OOO annually. This game, according to Mr. Bird,
has to stop. A new assessment of land is to yield £4OOO,
an increase of the land-tax on a graduated scale, £7OOO ;
railway charges are to be increased by £25,000 ; probate
duty, now collected on personalty only, is to apply to
realty and will produce £lO,OOO ; a new income-tax is to
gather in £50,000 ; a stamp duty, £5OOO. New revenue
from these sources is estimated at £134,000. With the
expenditure reduced as above by £33,000, the melancholy
Bird hopes to pull through without breaking up the
happy home to any great extent.
Bird’s proposals for future squaring of the Tas. ledger
are of a woefullv gimcrack nature. His income-tax is
really a house-tax, for, allegedly to obviate complaints
concerning the “inquisitorial” operations of the old
style of income-tax, the rental value of a man’s house is
to be taken as an index of his income. So if a citizen
with a £5OOO income likes to live in a four-roomed cottage
he will be practically exempt. How this will operate on
the building trade and allied occupations is sufficiently
obvious. The graduated land-tax is not likely to burst
up big estates or cheapen land to any extent worth men-
tioning, for nothing under £lO,OOO value is to be touched.
The scale runs: on estates valued at over £lO,OOO and
under £20,000, fd. in the £ ; over £20,000 and under
£50,000, fd. in the £; and over £50,000, Id. in the £.
As the bulk of Tas. unearned increment is in blocks of
land under £lO,OOO in value, and as the highest rate
proposed (Id. plus the present id. tax) is ridiculously
inadequate, and as the whole sum proposed to be raised
in this way only amounts to £7OOO, which a co. like the
Y.D.L. might pay all on its lonesome without a murmur,
Bird’s graduated land tax looks very small and weak.
The producer pays £25,000 a year in extra railway rates ;
the big landlord pays £7OOO ; and the absentee receives
no special attention whatever. Considering that the
landed proprietors have, within the last year or so, been
relieved of the old police rate to the extent of some
£26,000 per annum, they owe the Treasury a lot more
than the proposed £7OOO a year.
Nobody takes the Tas. Govt.’s proposal to abolish the
Upper House very seriously. The total amount of
the proposed saving by the adoption of the unicameral
system is only £4OOO a year, and as economy is the only
score on which any Treasurer would dare to advocate such
a thing in Tasmania, the chances are that the House of
Landlords will continue to flourish for an indefinite
period. To shift it there would need to be a strong
public agitation, for the Assembly is so built that it finds
it extremely handy to retain the House of Refuse as a
“ kind person to adopt undesirable infants.” The
Assembly will not, of its own motion, fight the “ other
place” to a finish, and the average Tas. citizen can
see no points in “proceshing” and agitating for
the removal of an ancient tradition when the
direct monetary saving will only amount to £4OOO a
year. If King O’Malley’s present crusade among the
Western miners extends to the cities and the apple
orchards and the hop-gardens, it may be possible to
organise an agitation for the abolition of the Upper House
on the ground that it is a useless excrescence and an
unmitigated nuisance. Failing such agitation, the House
of Adye Douglas looks like a permanency. At present it
is snorting so loudly at the proposal to incorporate it with
a reduced Lower House that the Govt, will, in all pro-
bability, be afraid to mention even that mild reform above
a whisper.
Medical Advertising 1 .
The British Medical Association (N.S.W. branch)
came to no definite decision at the meeting
called to protest against doctors giving inter-
views on matters of medicine to the “lay”
the non-medical) press, holding that
such interviews constitute “advertising” in
an indirect fashion. Those of the public who can
take an impartial and dispassionate view of the
matter will thoroughly sympathise with any
honest effort to restrict medical advertising. The
present rule against doctors advertising is
both for the benefit of the profession and for
the benefit of the public. Were it to be
abrogated no one would gain except the
newspaper proprietaries; the struggling young
doctor would find it harder than ever to get a
footing, competing against rich and well-estab-
lished men able to advertise freely ; and the
general public would ultimately have to pay the
bill for the advertising in the shape of increased
fees. Those are the practical considerations,
apart from the sentimental one of the loss of
dignity to the medical profession, and the very
substantial medical one that the better-educated
patients would have their confidence in doctors
who competed for the public’s guinea on hoardings
and in newspapers very seriously diminished (and
that confidence is the best drug in any ill-
ness). The efforts of the association to dis-
countenance advertising are good in their
aim ; whether their method is irreproachable is
another issue. The N.S.W. Branch B.M. A. has,
rightly or wrongly, got the reputation of
cliqueism and favoritism, of persecuting some
doctors with frivolous charges and of letting other
offenders do almost as they please. It hardly has
the full confidence of either the profession or the
public; and its actions, however good their object,
are sometimes met with antagonism for that
reason. In the matter of what may be called
“ indirect advertising ” much must necessarily be
left to individual good taste. At times of great
public interest in a medical point it seems too
stringent a rule to forbid doctors of high repute to
give information to the lay press. There was one
particular press incident in connection with the
King’s late illness which was altogether indefen-
sible; if the B.M. A. were to confine its censure to
that it would have the general support of the
public.
Industrial Arbitration in N.S.W.
There have been during the past week two
important industrial developments in N.S.W.
arising out of the lately-passed Industrial Arbitra-
tion Act. A deputation from the Tramway
Employees’ Union waited upon the Railway Com-
missioners to ask for the official “ recognition ” of
their union as a preliminary to the discussion of
grievances. This the Commissioners refused, and,
the point being insisted upon by the men, a
serious position threatens. It seems to be an
undignified quarrel over a word on the part of the
Railway Commissioners. Under the Arbi-
tration Act the tramway employees can
register as an industrial union, and thereby gain
a legal standing which no refusal of recogni-
tion by the Railway Commissioners can affect.
The Commissioners may say that the union doesn’t
exist; they may also say that Australia
doesn’t exist. Neither assertion will have any
material effect. If. then, the Union has any
grievance with the Commissioners it can ask
redress and, failing to get it, can bring the matter
before the Arbitration Court. What the Unions
as yet fail to recognise in full is that the Arbitra-
tion Act relieves them of all necessity of threaten-
ing unpleasantness or of “demanding recog-
nition”; they can simply formulate their require-
ments, confer about them if the other side is
agreeable, ;and, in case of final dispute, send the
matter to a Court of Justice, just as a contention
about the ownership of a piece of land or the
rights and wrongs of an alleged slander case can be
referred to judicial arbitrament. Another develop-
ment in connection with the Act was a labor depu-
tation to the Premier and the Attorney-General to
complain of the recent decision in the A.W.U. case,
and to ask for an amendment of the Arbitration
Act —(1) to prevent lawyers taking part in its
proceedings; (2) to prevent the multiplicity of
unions in any one calling, and to ensure that each
union should be a “good faith” one. The first
request opens up a very big question ; there is no
more reason, and no less, why lawyers should be
barred out of the Arbitration Court than out of
any other. Possibly, one day they will be barred
out of all Courts. As to the second request, the
Act makes ample provision in the direction indi-
cated : the A.W.U. failed in its application to
squash a rival union only because certain A.W.U.
rules made it impossible that a Court of Justice
should force all shearers and shed-hands into its
ranks. Labor advocates would be well-advised if
they waited a little while before rushing to com-
plain of the Arbitration Act. Mr. J ustice Cohen
and his assistants seem to be administering it
with an admirable impartiality, and, so adminis-
tered, the Act is certainly wide enough and well-
considered enough to confer very great benefits on
the community, and on the workers particularly.

“Pace Pry” on a white-labor experiment in
N.Q.: —
The Mosman sugar district is a very large area of
country north of Townsville. There are thousands of
acres of the finest sugar lands in Australia awaiting
settlement. Mr. Woods, M.P. for Woothakata, a practical
man and a believer in White Australia, took up the
challenge of the local farmers before the last election ana
guaranteed that he would get a gang of reliable white
men to take the place of colored labor to cut the cane
this season, and afterwards become settlers on the un-
occupied sugar lands of the Mosman. Woods, M.P.,
won his election, and kept his word. He produced the
men, and white men are doing the work previously done
by black labor. They are doing it successfully and earn-
ing good wages. The “trashing”—“the awful, soul-
killing work that would be too much for white men, in
Pastor Bevan’s opinion—is being done by white labor.
And white labor is cane-cutting, and loading cane-
trucks, and laying portable tram-lines. And this
particular white labor, according to Woods, M.f.,
reckons it the softest job it ever struck. Smith s
—(lmmortal Smith’s)— gang consists of 22 field men
and a cook. When they started they elected a leader
to have sole control of the job, and to be the medium of
communication between the Mosman Mill Co. and the
gang. And the manager of the Mosman Mill Co. seems
anxious that no obstacle should be thrown in the way of
the success of the experiment. The men work eight
hours a dav, six days a week, with the result that sugar
farmers are so satisfied that they are employing white
men to do the stripping in the fields. The men receive
4s 6d. per ton for cutting and loading cane and laying
portable tram lines, and 15s. per acre for trashing cane.
At these rates the men average £2 and £3 per week

The Bulletin notes with satisfaction that a jury
in Armidale (inquest on Trooper Edgar, acci-
dentally shot dead) has had the courage to with-
stand bounce from a coroner. Daily paper
report: —
The foreman announced that the jury wished to inspect
the ground. The Coroner declined to adjourn the Court.
The foreman insisted, and said the verdict of the jury
might be materially affected by an inspection of the
ground at the present stage of the inquiry. The Coroner
said he would not waste the time of the Court, and was
proceeding to examine another witness when the foreman
again renewed his application, and said the jury intended
to report the matter to the Department of Justice. He
considered that the jury had been insulted by the Coroner.
The Coroner, with great warmth, said the foreman could
do as he pleased. He knew his duty, and the jury would
leave the Court at their peril. He considered he had been
subjected to insult. The case was then proceeded with.
After another witness had been examined, Senior-
Sergeant Sharp renewed the application on behalf of the
jury for a visit fto the ground, whereupon the Coroner
consented to adjourn the Court till Wednesday.
When the same attitude is taken up by all juries,
each time Magistrate, District Court Judge, or
Supreme Court *Tudge attempts “ bounce, 5 there
will be fewer scandals in the administration of
justice. If, in the Mount Rennie case, a juryman
had had the courage to firmly protest against
“ all-night sittings” of the Court; if, in scores of
other cases which might be cited, jurymen had
recollected that their privileges and dignities m
Court are equal to those of the presiding Judge,
many a blood stain would have been spared to
our history.

“ Arthur Glint ” writes from Victoria: —
The Marnoo Estate, near Horsham, comprising 9000
acres, has been offered for sale to Vic. Government, and
now that farmers are leaving the district to become
tenants of Southern landlords, it will probably be
bought by said Govt, as a site suitable for a rabbit-
warren. The land monopolist knows his business.
Marnoo Estate' is about in the same position as the
pelican in the wilderness; when there are signs of
a general exodus of the people to more favored parts, the
owner offers his no longer profitable monopoly to Govt.
Transactions of this sort are bringing Vic. Govt, into bad
repute as a land-buyer, for these deals, instead of improv-
ing the condition of the people, only become burdens,
like the national drunks. The fact that there is no com-
pulsory-resumption clause in Vic. Land Act makes collu-
sion between a prospective seller and the Govt, agents
possible. As things stand, Govt, is apt to lie
victimised or the taxpayers robbed. The purchases
undertaken now can only be with the consent of
owners, and we well know what that means. In fact,
without a compulsory resumption clause in the
Land Act, Govt, is driven to buy only those estates that
owners want to sell, probably because of their partial
worthlessness ; and estates which the people want Govt,
to buy, because of their fertility and general productive-
ness, the Govt, cannot buy, for the very good reason that
owners won’t sell. Hence the Northern landlord is able
to hand his bad asset over to the State, to become the
bad asset of the people ; also, the Southern landlord is
able to gather the fruits of monopoly unmolested. If
legislators cannot be found who have no respect for the
traditions of the local squattocracy, Victoria will soon be
in a bad way. Therefore, Victorian democrats should
fight tooth-and-nail for the insertion in the Land Act of
a compulsory resumption clause, even if, in the struggle
to obtain that result, the Leg. Council has to go.

A most worthy clause in the Federal Electoral
Bill is that which restricts the election expenses
of Representatives to £lOO and Senators to £250.
A poor man can’t be expected to spend more than
that, and a rich man shouldn’t be allowed to.
The country may want to choose its politicians on
what it believes to be their merits, but it is always
liable to have its judgment unconsciously biassed
by cash expenditure,<sor to be led astray by thi
panegyrics of newspapers bought up by the rich
candidate, and disinterested admirers hired by tin
rich candidate; and the only way to give a fail
deal is by restriction all round. By-and-bye, ii
will be necessary to go further, and make it un-

Truman-Leumane Australian-made opera
‘‘ Mathis ” was presented, for first time, last
Saturday,. to an audience —principally musicians
and musician-lovers—at Sydney Criterion Theatre.
Leumane, who held up the heavy name-part on
the stage in melodious, strong-man style, is respon-
sible for the libretto, a piece of work which has
scholarly and literary attributes. “Mathis” is
founded upon Erckmann-Chatrian’s romance, “The
Polish Jew”—same story that made the corner-
stone and foundation for “The Bells,” in which
Irving played so famously as Matthias. An inn-
keeper, miller and limebumer has promised his
daughter Annette, who is betrothed to a young
soldier, the liberal dowry of 30,000 francs. The
bridal day is at hand but the dowry isn’t. The
till is empty and Matthias distractedly wonders
how he shall fill it. Sleighbells are heard across
the snow and enter atravelling diamond merchant,
a Polish Jew. He leaves his belt filled with jewels
on the table while he attends to his horse. Of
this means to do ill deeds Innkeeper Mathis takes
full advantage, drugs the Jew’s wine, burns his
body in the lime-kiln, and later settles the price
of the stolen jewels on his Annette. Rest of the
story (as told in the opera) opens a year after,
and Truman, the composer, has set forth in
music the misery a conscience may bring
its possessor, for Mathis neglected to cremate
his conscience along with the Jew’s body. His
visions, remorse, fear of hell and gradual mental
decay are also set forth in solo, choral and or-
chestral music. Grand Opera writing is an am-
bitious undertaking, and if Mr. Truman hasn’t
quite succeeded in hitching his score to a star he
—well, he can console himself that neither has
any other composer—those who did were demigods
in music. The ruby eye of Mathis is the
Intermezzo which follows the first act. In it is
expressed the delight of the betrothed pair, as
well as prevision of the fate of the conscience-
stricken man. The murder is re-enacted for the
benefit of the audience in a dream of Mathis’s.
He dies immediately after awakening from
the horror, surrounded by the wedding-guests,
whose joyous bridal chorus turns to a funereal
hymn extolling sleep and rest. Audience mostly
agreed with Slapoffski and Leon Caron’s senti-
ments as printed on the programmes, namely, that
“ Mathis ” was musically and dramatically excel-
lent and. had “fire.” Miss Annie Perry, who ap-
peared in the prima-donna rdle, gave a capital
account of herself in song, and short skirts, as the
bride with the stolen dowry an! the small feet.
Miss Bertha Paning was a too-young mother
who sings a sweet, sad song as she spins at a
wheel. Her voice, though, has sounded better
on many a concert platform. Mr. Rainford, as the
Polish Jew, intoned his small part and looked
like a not very wild wild-beast. Mr. H. Huxham,
with a big black (stage) mo. and a small, light
tenor voice, was Christian, the soldier-lover.
Baritone Edward Farley, as Heinrich, completed
the caste. The mounting was everything that the
best innkeeping society round the blue Alsatian
mountains might desire.

Sheridan (John F.) takes possession of the
Criterion next Saturday, with a new musical
comedy, “The Lady Slavey.”
&* * *
According to the Brough programme,
“Niobe” is to be revived at Sydney Royal on
Wednesday, Thursday, and Friday of this week.
The tearful Greek lady who was recalled to life
on the London premises of Peter Amos Dunn,
through having electric shocks applied to her
ancient Greek feet, has always been an immense
favorite, and her farewell ought to be a function
of great size and tonnage. After that, a new
Pinero comedy, “Iris,” follows on Saturday;
and the fact that Pinero is always worth listen-
ing to is too well-known to require repetition.
Under these arrangements, “When We Were
Twenty-one” departs before Sydney had made
up its mind whether to like it or not. Per-
haps, if it had remained a while longer,
so as to have time to soak in, it might have been a
favorite, but it didn’t get the time. The most
frequent question asked about it is how Brough
proposed to become notorious along with the red
lady with the bad temper. When Brough and
his friends discovered that their adopted Lout was
going to marry that highly-purchasable person
Brough decided to buy her himself. .He offered
her £lOOO to become such a public scandal with
him that the Lout must needs hear of it and be
too shocked to marry her. But when he handed
over the money he made it a condition that he
and the red lady were never to meet after
that moment, and how he was going to be-
come a public scandal and a shock with a
woman who was never seen along with him
passes understanding. There are women whose
characters are so white that they can be
soiled by post-card, or breathed upon through the
telephone, but the Firefly’s reputation had seen
hard service up and down Europe, and it would be
necessary to hug her in broad daylight in front of
the Bank of England to work up a really service-
able scandal. The cry of an ordinary-sized scandal
wouldn’t be heard above the roar of her past
performances. This discrepancy has been com-
mented on in nearly every hotel in Sydney ; and it,
combined with the unpleasant signs of temper
shown by the allegedly nice girl, and the Lout’s
resolve to redeem his character by going to the
war and killing somebody, were serious drawbacks.
The last item was especially behind-hand and
antiquated. The war is over now, and the Jingo
joss is dead. An up-to-date Lout would have
declared his fixed determination to become a ping-
pong champion, and thus retrieve his wasted
youth.

The “Great Ruby ” discontinues its varied
career at Sydney Lyceum this week. It is to be
succeeded by “With Flying Colors” —said to
be something about the British navy. The
chance to insert a few remarks to the
effect that Australia should also have a navy,
instead of paying an annual contribution for
the loan of a few Ark-bottomed samples of
the British fleet, over which samples it has no
control whatever, will doubtless be lost. The
British tar is a noble soul, and we should admire
him tremendously, but if we try to imitate him it
is a suspicious circumstance which ought to be put
down.

“A Little Ray of Sunshine,” at Sydney
Palace, has improved considerably since the first
night as regards the playing, the actors having
“ settled down ” to their parts. Bright acting
by Miss Eva Macdonald, as a little girl,
stands out now among the feminine charac-
ters. The play, however, still depends abso-
lutely on Mr. Thornton’s pourtrayal of Lord
Markham, the eccentric old individual whose
schemes are much aided by his luck in falling
among a nest of very clumsy fibbers, headed by
Mr. Carlton, “of the Diplomatic Service.” If
British diplomacy has to depend on such poor
rolled-gold brummagem liars as Mr. Carlton, its
failure when it tries to diplomatise against the
patient pig-tailed Chinaman is quite explainable.
The Thornton season closes on Aug. 8. After
that, Williamson’s crowd is due with “ San Toy.”
** * *
Sydney Tivoli rejoices just now in a very
strong bill. Cinquevalli, with his nimble muscles
and his almost as nimble wits, amuses as much as
he astonishes, and thus fulfills all the require-
ments of a star turn. Tom Wootwell seems to
have an inexhaustible budget of good songs ; one
of the latest, sung in “Pecksniff” character, with
its catchy refrain beginning “Oh, my bretherin,
join together in,” threatens to be whistled every-
where. Mark Anthony is another entirely amus-
ing person, and Roberti (a basso with a most
remarkable phiz), Sullivan (tenor), Miss Jennie
Opie, and Miss Ray Jones all contribute good
turns.
** * *
“The Circus Girl,” at Her Majesty’s
(Melb.), shows a commendable desire to profit
by experience, and work upwards in the estima-
tion of a kindly-disposed public. Scenes that
were heaviest on first night have been relieved
of unnecessary ballast ; the orchestra puts more
color and sparkle into the music ; the performers,
here and there, are making slight improvements
in their character-sketches. Even the Terrible
Turk, whose mountainous amateurishness was
pathetic when he first took the floor, begins to
look less unhappy. If the stage-manager could
but teach ex-Constable Kelly to appear Terrible
at the outset and intoxicated later on—if he were
sufficiently advanced in histrionics to fall with a
convincing thud when the audience was
looking—if he _ could only seem to express
the disastrous influence of 8 quarts of circus
champagne, Kelly Pasha would be a gigantic
success. The human items in Signor Drivelli’s
Circus awaken slumbering memories of “The
Grasshopper,” a drama that Jennie Lee brought
to Australia long ago. Hugh Ward introduces
his pale meditative clown to notice in much the
same way that the late Harwood used to trot out
Dismal Jimmy, or the Man with the Iron Jaw.
“The Circus Girl” is at least a notable thing as
regards make-up. Ward is a picture of an old-
fashioned showman, and if Pat Bathurst, as the
ringmaster, were to walk into Fitzgerald’s arena
and shake his whip the horses would unanimously
rise upon their hind legs and salute the splendid
vision. Lauri, on the other hand, is not at all a
striking suggestion of an American bar-tender.
He wants briskness. For no ostensible reason he
paints his face as though he had a cold in the
head. In fact, he tries to get laughs for Lauri
rather than smiles for the character he plays, and
the result is disappointing. Some pleasant allu-
sions to the ladies are held over for a week, but
meanwhile the present scribe wishes that Carrie
Moore would not act quite so effusively. Carrie
has all sorts of charms, except the charm of self-
restraint.
** * *
This is the last week of the mangle and
other foolishness at Melbourne Royal. On Saturday
a new and original, likewise a novel and realistic
drama, entitled “ The Worst Woman in London,”
will take the place of the present reckless outrage.
Miss Duggan is to reappear, after a few weeks
rest, in the libellous character of the Worst
Woman.
** * *
Certain events which had been announced
for last Saturday were postponed for different
reasons. Dolores the Delightful was to sing at
the Town Hall, and a lot of people came along to
buy the pleasure of listening to that graoious
warbler, but at the last moment mademoiselle
found herself unable to appear. Her throat was
k? suffering from a sudden attack
of Melbourne climate. At time of writing it is
hoped that Mdlle. Dolores will be able to accom-
plish her four farewell recitals during the week;
also it is known for certain that she will not take
any liberties with her valuable throat. Therefore
this journal leaves the Melbourne newspaper
advts. to state whether Dolores will appear to-
night (Thursday) and again on Saturday, and
whether the latter night will be the farewell
occasion or not.
* m *
Henry Lees production of “Cyrano de
Bergerac,” at the Bijou, was another matter-for
postponement. The play is a large, spectacular
show which must be well done if it is to go, and
as the rehearsals last week seemed short of work
-in a sporting way of speaking—“ Cyrano ” was
fixed for a week later. On Saturday (2nd), Henry
Lee will appear as the hero of 1000 duels and the
unfortunate possessor of a Nose.
** * #
™Vu Svveet T?^ ell of Drury” returns to
Melbourne Princess’s on Saturday (2nd) Which
is to say that Nellie Stewart and Charles the
Iwoth will certainly be welcomed back on the
date aforesaid if nothing happens to prevent
them accepting the ovation. And Melbourne
prays for their reappearan<?e. “A Chinese Honey-
moon has got to be widely esteemed for its
splendor, and its music, and its rampageous slavey-
girl, but the average citizen will be glad to have
something that is quite as pretty and much more
interesting.

At the Opera House the attraction of
Lydia Yeamans-Titus and the rest of the pro-
gramme is “overwhelming,” especially on Satur-
day nights. Ada Delroy and James Bell are
recent arrivals, whilst the Jacksons, the Harveys,
the Wiltons, and the eminent professor of the
saxophone retain their positions. Also Tom
Nawn is appearing in a new sketch, “The Poli-
tician.” Nawn, in a state of politics and alcohol,
is much the same Nawn as usual, but his elec-
tioneering tactics include some new ideas. He is
the first man who ever thought of forming a
Hebrew Hod-Carriers’ Association.

The second Saturday of Dan Barry and
co. at the Gaiety found a larger and better audi-
ence than before. Better because there were more
girls wearing nice hats and dreamy eyes, from
which it would appear thattheirthrifty Adolphuses
had discovered the financial advantages of dealing
at Dan’s Dramatic Supply Stores. The nice hats
and their young men were not critical. “A Ride
for Life ” was accepted with signs of gratitude.
Dan himself, in a white umbrella and a badly-
fitting wig, was an elderly person flitting about
amidst a whirl of red-shirted bushrangers and
other eruptions. Rege Rede was a welcome
gleam as the providential Australian lad who
talks about the Melbourne Cup and circumvents
the villain. So also was the prettiness of Miss
Lila Byford ; but Gladys Grant was not up to
sample as per “A Gilded Sin,” not having the
power to express violent mental agony for three
consecutive hours. Dan’s chances of survival at
cheap rates seem to be improving.
** * *
The comedy advertised as “The Wrong
Mrs. Wright ” and which duly broke out at the
Queen’s Theatre last Saturday, was nothing more
nor less than “Jane.” And the Queen’s Theatre,
when one turned into it, turned out to be the neat
little hall at the back of the busy pub. where
“The Red Stockings” co. high-kicked in days of
yore. Two of the Cosgrove brethren figured
capably in the forefront of the show that wasn’t
“The Wrong Mrs. Wright.”
* * * *
Pretty Ada Willoughby appeared as the
wrongly-used Jane, and her somewhat frisky per-
formance called for no disparaging remarks. The
charges for admission to witness “The Trans-
formation of Jane” were 35., 2s. and Is., but the
supply of patrons at even the humble shilling was
greatly exceeded by the demand.
** # #
The people—and they were numerous—
who said that Dani was a potent attraction to the
Amy Castles concerts, because he was the most
loudly-applauded performer of the crowd, are now
lying low and saying nothing. Dani has proved
to be a quite ineffectual “star” on his own
account, whereas the Amy Castles co., minus Una
Bourne and the plump Italian tenor (Neal M‘Kay
being substituted for liim) continues to do boom
business at 3,2, and 1 prices. From Tasmania the
co. returned to Victoria —Geelong and Ballarat —
thence to N.S.W., with Queensland in view. The
tour is expected to close in a fortnight from now—
but why should it? There can be no longer any
pretence of a necessity for the “Princess of Song”
to return to London or Paris within a certain
time, seeing that the original “ time limit ” for the
tour has already been exceeded by many weeks.
And, as for the nonsense talked about the danger
of over-taxing her voice, it is a fact that Miss
Castles’ voice has thriven on the moderate
amount of work demanded of it. At Ballarat the
prima-donna was a comparatively greater success
than she had been in Melbourne (judging success
by the all-round heartiness of the applause), and
those who had heard her before were the warmest
admirers. Another improved member of the co.
is Needham, the baritone. Needham sings fetch-
ingly,' and is calculated to thrill the same girls
with less effort than Dani lavished on his task.
The slim young man joins one of the William-
sonian opera co.’s at the conclusion of the Castles
concert campaign.
** * *
The Hawfcrey Co. has continued to occupy
Adelaide Royal, relying chiefly on the furniture-
moving gentleman from Mars. Winifred Austin,
of Sydney, who has much improved, now takes
Miss Ray’s part, and Adelaide’s own Heggie is
the Messenger. Holloway is announced to follow,
with something about Revenge. Manager Pol-
lock is seriously ill again. The Tivoli has got
strongly back to work, with a small but starlike
co. The Sidney Drews score heavily in a kind of
mixture of “The Taming of the Shrew ” with the
last act of “ Iris,” wherein the husband (always in
a gentlemanly way) wrecks a whole apartment in
search for a collar-stud that isn’t lost. Harris and
Walters are another American pair, of the
“ sketch ” order; Harcourt is a conjuror beyond
thecommon; and “Prof.” Macann shows a reason-
able claim to call himself the concertina “ king.”
And there isn’t a comic song in the programme !
The Wild Cat Column.
Extract from S.M. Herald report of Importer
M'Millan’s speech at Euroa (Vic.): “Out of 112 millions
of wealth actually produced per annum in Australia
manufactures represent 28 millions, and of the latter nine
millions were produced in New South Wales without one
farthing of Protection. But you may reasonably say that
I cannot expect to arouse much enthusiasm among the
people of Victoria if I cannot prove that this Freetrade
policy of ours, this ideal tariff at which we aim, is just as
good for Victoria as for the other States. If I could not
prove this I would not be here to-night. Victoria in 1899
produced or manufactured wealth amounting to about
31 millions. Of this 10 millions were produced by manji-
faoturers. But New South Wales, without any duties,
produced 9 millions through her manufactures. Unless
the people of Victoria are inferior to those of New South
Wales—a most absurd idea with people of a common race
—then out of the 10 millions produced by Victoria she
could have manufactured 9 millions without any duty
whatever. What, then, did she pay for the luxury of the
extra million ? Only one million in customs, from which
New South Wales was free.”
So M'Millan practically assures the Victorians
that, if they had followed his advice, and given up Pro-
tection, they would only have destroyed one-tenth of
their manufactures (equal to throwing 6600 people out
of work), and only sacrificed £1,000,000 of revenue, which
would have made the Treasury insolvent. And he calls
that an inducement to Freetrade ! Of course every person
of education (if M'Millan believes his own yarn, he is a
person without education) knows that N.S.W. didn’t
achieve even the results it did “ without one farthing of
Protection.” Even under Keid’s Dry-Dog,tariff, which was
the nearest it ever got to Freetrade, it heavily protected
wine, beer, sugar, newspapers, tobacco, cigars, molasses,r
jams, jellies, biscuits, confectionery, &c. And Victoria neves
collected £1,000,006 a year more than N.S.W. in customl
duties—in 1900 it collected £659,000 more. But al
the mendacity attaohed to his yarn doesn’t in any way
diminish the wild humor of M'Millan’s assurance that the
blessings of Freetrade would leave over 6000 Victorians
unemployed, and make the State bankrupt by depriving
it of £1,000,000 revenue.

These are prosperous-looking’ figures, and if the Ballarat
Trustees continues to progress at this rate it will yet he
one of the strongest institutions of its kind in Australasia.
The chief essentials arblhat it should adhere to its policy
of carrying about half its profits to reserve (even on this
basis it pays 10 per cent, dividends, which should be large
enough to satisfy the most rapacious shareholder), and
that it should invest its funds, as hitherto, mostly in good
Government securities. At present its principal invest-
ments are in Victorian State securities, and at a time
when a good many Australian State securities begin to
look rather ghastly, those of Victoria, as the least
embarrassed of the States, are probably about the best.
By way of a side issue, the fact that the Ballarat Banking
Co. and the Ballarat Trustees, Executors and Agency Co.
show such a material improvement this half-year, while
so many Melbourne and Sydney institutions do the reverse,
seems to suggest that the big cities are not bad places to
be out of, in a business sense, just at present.

After a long struggle the Equity Trustees, Executors and
Agency Co. appears to be at last building up a substantial
business. It would have been in a much more solid
position if it had not increased its dividend to 7£ per
cent, so soon, and, in view of the fluctuating character of
the trustee business, it remains to be seen if it hasn’t
raised it to 8 per cent, rather soon. Still, if the co.
doesn’t go beyond 8 per cent., which is a figure that
should satisfy anybody, and if the earnings remain at the
average rate of the last two years, progress will be
reasonably rapid. The investments are chiefly in State
and municipal securities and in the co.’s own premises,
which are unencumbered ; and if the risky mortgage
business is avoided (which it has been, to a great extent,
so far), things should go well. One fact worth noting is
that ±4501 of the assets consists of “ commissions, &c.,”
due to the co., but uncollected. This represents nearly
a whole year’s income, and suggests that the co. credits
itself with commission on an estate as soon as it comes
into its hands. A much wiser process would be to take
credit for commission only when actually collected. In
the boom days some trustee companies gaily took credit
for, and to a great extent distributed as dividends, com-
mission on estates supposed to be worth £lOO,OOO, which
shrunk to £50,000 or less before realisation. And, natur-
ally, the commission shrank likewise.

The progress made at rebuilding the lost reserve fund is
getting to be so very slow, and the fall in profits is so
continuous, that the dividend ought certainly to be cut
down to 4 per cent, until the co. is stronger.

If the Queensland Trustees can keep up the average rate
of progress of the last 18 months its prospects are good.
Its reserves are now growing on a respectable scale, and
it seems to have got over its former unwise habit of pay-
ing away practically everything in dividends, while the
urgent need to strengthen the institution was neglected.
Probably the recent boom arose partly out of the Tyson
estate —nearly every Queensland institution made a little
out of the winding up of James Tyson—and in that case
it may not be fully maintained. But a good general busi-
ness is being got together, and providing the co. doesn’t
give way fo exorbitant hunger after dividends, and the
management is reasonably careful, its future should be
prosperous.

Although the severe drought has detrimentally
affected mining, there are still many mines requiring
pumps of all descriptions, and to those we would recom-
mend the A.S. Cameron Steam Pumps. Besides these, a
much-improved Gyratory Crusher is now on the market—
viz., the “Austin”- in style on the Gates’ system, but
greatly improved throughout, and having special features
which make them superior to all others. The agents for
the above are Messrs. W. and J. Lempriere, 500 Little
Collins St., Melbourne. This enterprising firm is always
to the front with the best of every mining appliance,
which includes the unparalleled Luhrig Concentrating
Vanner.*

Very extensive alterations and improvements
have just been completed at the engineering works of
Mephen Ferguson, Melbourne. The principal item of
interest is a new Electric Welding plant, which is now in
use welding the steel-plates required in the manufacture
of the patent spiral riveted pipes which are in such large
demand for water-supply, mining and other purposes.
The new method of welding is giving very satisfactory
results, and is well worth seeing.*

that it was hard to tell the amount of the real reserves.
Real reserves are only ascertainable when such paper
items as "goodwill” are subtracted from the nominal
reserves. The present progress, however, look 3 very
satisfactory, barring the fact that the drought is a diffi-
culty which may prove even larger than is expected. In
view of that fact a 7 per cent, dividend might be a wise
precaution until better seasons arrive.

The Castlemaine Brewery Co., like many other institu-
tions, would do better if it traded to a greater extent on
its own capital, and less on borrowed money. It has a
paid-up capital of £125,000, otherwise it trades on £143,995
of borrowed money (5 per cent, debentures, £100,000;
and mortgages, £13,995) and an Overdraft of about £2600.
Interest on these liabilities swallows up about half the
profits, which, by reason of the cut-throat competition
which has raged for years among Melbourne beer-makers,
are not large at present. A Beer Trust is what Melbourne
brewers want. Melbourne wholesale beer prices are now
so very much below Sydney level, that the brewing busi-
ness is only a shadow of its old self.

In view of these results it seems almost needless for the
directors to mention in their report that the N.S.W.
Government has lately settled up with the co. for its
property in the resumed area of Sydney. Looking at the
figures, anyone would naturally assume that the co. had
been settling up with some simple-minded Government
or other kindly Juggins. The co. makes no mention of
anything extraordinary in its statement of profits—the
net earnings are put down at the moderate figure of
£5507. But the insurance reserve has increased from
±17,458 at December, 1901, to £30,555 at June, 1902—this
without any visible addition to it from any visible fund.
Presumably the settlement arrived at with the Govern-
ment has something to do with this result.

A Broken Hill M.P., talking wildly in the
Assembly on a labor-suspension matter, the other night,
said that the Pinnacles should be employing 3000 men.
The ore, it was said, was richer than that in the big
Broken Hill mines. No doubt it is rich, but it is even
inore refractory than the B.H. stuff, pyrrhotine being
present as well as sulphur and zinc. Attempt after
attempt to treat it has failed ; everybody who has tried
to work it has dropped money. Mines in the district,
containing equally good ore, though in smaller bodies,
have been open for years. Apropos labor-covenants,
much nonsense is talked. M’sL. A., in the debate referred
to, wanted to know what would happen at Broken Hill
if the Minister suspended the covenants of those leases ?
As a matter of fact, it would make very little difference ;
if the co’s kept on only the dozen or so men prescribed
in the bond and sacked the rest, Broken Hill would feel
just about as good over it as a man who has been
toasted all but his little finger.
• • * *
In the row over the reconstruction of the B.H.
South all the sympathy is with the holders of contribut-
ing shares. But that isn’t likely to save them. They
have struck the two ends of a piece of bad luck at once.
First, they are the minority ; second, the majority are
led by an uncommonly greedy crowd. Not the directors,
or anyway not all of them, but the greater than the
directors who pull the strings. The position may be
sized-up like this: About eight years ago the South,
having used up its carbonates in a silly attempt to be its
own smelter, faced a cold world with nothing but sulphides
to sell, and nobody would then take sulphides at a gift.
Its shares got down to a shilling or so, and there was talk
of winding up ; but that was saved by a reconstruction—
as a last hope a few believers put their half-crowns into it,
taking contributors’ shares. If they had had half the
greed and half the knack of driving a bargain that their
present opponents have, they would have stuck out for
preference shares and got them. Anyhow they took con-
tributors, and by the time their shares were 4s. 6d. paid
up, the next-to-hopeless mine, which had declared only two
or three divs. out of its carbonates, was actually paying
divs. out of its sulphides, and the promoters’ shares had
sailed up from a nominal value to past a pound. Since then
divs. have been regular and the value has gone up more.
Some people expected that the grateful promoters would
Want to distribute medals or something among the con-
tributors who had thus saved the situation ; but they
didn’t know these promoters who, instead, decided that
it would be a good idea to make the contributors pay for
new machinery while they (the promoters) alone took the
divs. And they did—for 18 months or so along with
every div. notice has gone to the contributor a call
notice. But that process didn’t suck the contributor fast
enough ; and, besides, there would come a time when he
would not be iiable to be sucked any more. The new scheme
is to overcomethatglaring defect. The managing director,
speaking for the directors, proposes that the contributors
(whose shares are now paid up to Bs. 6d.) should pay
is. 6d. a share and then get a 10s. share in a new co.,
while the promoters (£1 shares nominally) shall take two
10s. shares. Another 78,000 odd shares are to be
divided pro rata, not among the contributing shareholders
alone, but among all shareholders. The result of this
juggle will be that, instead of having rather more than
one-third the shares and being entitled to more than one-
third of the divs., the contributors will get less than one-
fourth of the shares, and be entitled to less than one-fourth
of the profits, even after they have paid the eighteen-
penny fine. And the co , it is to he remembered, is
not hard-up ; on the contrary, a div.-notice was issued
two days after this unspeakably greedy and cheeky circu-
lar was sent out with a snuffle to the shareholders. The
only good thing about the whole business is the purpose
for which the money (£45,000) is to be used—to sink a
new shaft and to increase the output from 3000 to 5000
tons a week. Even those ends, though, don’t justify this
bail-up. But do the directors really mean it ? Is it
bluff ? Are they waiting for contributors to say, “ Why,
we would rather pay up what is unpaid,” to get in with,
“ Well, pay up ! ”
The moral of the B.H. South “ situation ” is—
Never assume that any contributing shares are not
loaded. London Stock Exchange would not quote even
the B. 11. Prop, stock until a small liability on itscontribs.
was wiped off—which was done in ’B9 by making a call
and declaring a div. at the same time.
* * * •
B.H. Prop, to the end of its half-year (May 31)
had paid £7,408,000 in divs. and £BB,OOO in bonuses, apart
from cash and share distributions on the flotations of
“ pups.” This in 17 years, though it is less than 16 since
the first div. was paid. In the half-year when first it got
its furnaces in blast its ore was worth £l5 2s. sd.
a ton—at least it got that much out of the ore. Costs
were then £6 15s. 4d., and the profit was £8 7s. Id.
(Silver, fine, was 4s. 1J(1., and lead £l3 16s. 4d. then.)
Last half-year costs were £ll9s. l jd., and profit 3s. ljd.
The reduction of costs is in spite of the fact that the ore
cannot be now dumped into the smelter as it is broken,
but must be crushed, concentrated (for the removal of
zinc and gangue), roasted (for the removal of sulphur),
and briquetted (so that the fine concentrated stuff will
not cake in the furnace) before it gets to the smelter ;
and even then it is not a good smelting material. In silver
the co.’s most prolific year wa5’94 —14,054,3g30z., which
was between one-llth and one-12th of the world’s output
that year. Last 12 months’ was 5,238,1150 z., which is about
l-33rd. In lead the output was never before so great
as n0w —62,746 tons in the last 12 months, which is
between one-13th and oue-I4th of the world’s. A few other
figures for the past six months Products realised,
£652,005 (this includes bullion, &c., on hand); ore
treated, 308,838 tons(in ’94 it got up to 325,949 tons, which
is a six-months’ record) ; wages-sheets, approximately,
£331,830 ; freight and charges, £91,332 ; mine-timber,
£17,273 (in 1889 this item was over £lOO,OOO in six
months); coke and coal, £92,579 ; liquid assets in excess
of liabilities, £389,657 ; plant, £407,313 (after writing-off
over £560,000). The co. has an insurance fund of £6OOO,
and a reserve-fund of £l2s,ooo—counted, of course, in the
assets mentioned just now.
* m * *
B.H. North was “resting” last half-year; its
“working expenses” were £BO4, and its “expenses of
management” £64l—which seems to show that 1 ‘ resting”
pays the management better than it does the miner. The
co. has now a well-equipped and developed mine of
medium-grade ore, and an up-to-date plant waiting for
the lead market to pass £l2 before flring-up. When it
knocked off it could not pay its way at much under
£l3 10s.; but the new plant and other changes will
probably make 30s. a ton difference.

Lake George Mines (N.S.W.) to be abandoned.
Co. has £5OOO in hand with which “ it is proposed to pur-
chase some other Australian property on which to re-
erect the machinery.” London people must have an idea
that Australian mines are going a-begging, when they
assume that for £5OOO they can get a mine on which to
re-erect the extensive plant at Captain’s Flat. There is
machinery enough there to equip the biggest copper-
mine in the State. Lake George mine has been done to
death by faddists. No practical man can say that it has
been proved conclusively that the mine is a duffer. It
has a lode which for size, and persistency in length and
depth, has no equal in Australia, and, comparatively
speaking, it has been only surface-scratched. It
is true that in the deepest workings zinc pre-
ponderates, and there is only enough copper to swear
by. Zinc has gradually increased in quantity as the lode
has been sunk upon. Here is some expert advice offered
to the co., without any expectation of a 1000-guinea fee
or other reward: Use the £5OOO in hand to sink the
shaft 500 ft. deeper, and see whether the zinc continues to
increase or decrease. If the first contingency occurred,
it might be a profitable zinc-mine. The consensus of
practical opinion is that the zinc zone will be passed
through at no great depth, but Lake George controllers
have never shown any appreciation of really practical
advice.

J. H. Curie, of London Economist, who was
out here 12 months ago getting material for his book on
“ The Goldfields of the World,” has published it—nomi-
nally a new edition of an old book ; really a nearly-new
book. In their order he sets the world’s fields : Rand 1,
Cripple Greek 2, Kalgoorlie 3. The Rand is “ 10 times
greater than any other, nob necessarily because of its
greater present output, but because of its permanence.”
In ’9B, 75 Rand mines produced £15,141,376, and of these
40 paid £4,834,159 in divs. There are, he says, 124
co’s. on the main-reef banket beds, and most
of these will eventually give profits. “ For a
number of to come an average yield of
25 millions may be expected with reason, and it
is certain there is ore in sight to ensure a large
output for 30 years more.” Yet, “ in from five to ten
years from now a number of the richest Johannesburg
mines will be worked out,” and “ but few outside mines
will be added to the list of payable ventures.” Of
Rhodesia : “ It is a country of narrow reefs and short
ore-chutes.” Queensland disappointed him ; it “ needs
prospectors and capital.” Victoria has “ many hundreds
of small mines and no great ones.” Of Kalgoorlie : “ The
mines are getting both smaller and poorer in depth,” and
their London management is abominable. Murchison, on
the other hand, surprised him ; “ there are liberally hun-
dreds of reefs there, many of which carry gold.” Klondyke
has “ passed its zenith.” Mr. Curie doesn’t think much
of the average working miner, and he thinks less of the
average London director. As to the former, “ the
majority literally squander their wages on drink ahd
gambling, and live from hand to mouth all the time.” The
wages are so high that the miner should be able to save a
lot of money. Mr. Curie forgets that the metal-miner also
mostly lives where cost of living is highest, and that his
employment is erratic. And so far as it is true that the
miner is a drinker and a gambler (and in regard to
the Australian miner it is nob truer than it is of any
other big body of workmen) it might at least be con-
sidered whether his occupation does not predispose him
to it. Australia’s experience of the miner, and especially
of the gold-digger, is that he is just about as true and
plucky and staunch as anything that stands on legs.

Dear Bulletin. — Let me call attention to the
congested state of the W.A. labor market, especially on
the goldfields. There are probably 800 unemployed in
Kalgoorlie-Boulder district, as a walk round the Golden
Mile at change of shift will prove. On the out-back
goldfields, strange to say, there is always a surplus of
labor, and yet arrivals of workers from the Eastern States
largely exceed departures for same. Proportionately to
population, there are more unemployed on the W.A.
goldfields than in Sydney or Melbourne. Yet the gold-
fields are mainly responsible for sending seven Foreign-
traders to the Federal Parliament.—O.

That king of W.A. white elephants, Black Flag
Proprietary, is being set going again. A manager, with
the promising name of Solomon Israel, has arrived on the
mine, and intends, under orders from his English direc-
tors, to give the show a thorough test. This is what it
has never yet had. Although starting with the then
record capitalisation of £400,000, a large proportion of
which was actual cash, 9-10ths of the money was wasted
on the surface. A magnificent 50-head battery—the best
then on the fields—was put up. It was to have been 100
head, but the other 50 stamps were wisely counter-
nianded. Palatial residences were built for manager and
staff, brickmaking plant established, costly carriage-drive
made from the manager’s house to the mine, and—fitting
climax—a tennis-court was laid out, and a dark room for
photo-developing excavated in the main shaft. The first
crushing went either 5 or 7dwts., and the mine promptly
went bung. The main shaft collapsed shortly afterwards,
and completed the shareholders’ troubles. The exasper-
ating part of the affair is that those who know the
mine best say that it is all right—they have
endeavored to get hold of it on tribute, and have
continually opposed all labor ' suspensions. There
is a huge body of quartz outcropping for chains,
which has not, so far, been even faintly proved. The
huge share-capital that has been wasted will be a dead-
weight round the manager’s neck ; but writer will be sur-
prised if he doesn’t find something worth crushing.
Black Flag was the show which gave Henning—now a
leviathan in the London mining world—his start towards
fortune. What has become of Sam. Gifford, the Cornish
mining engineer, who reported so enthusiastically on the
property ? Has he realised that nothing fails like failure ?
Good money is being made in a quiet way by
small parties in W.A. Near Black Flag a party of four, in
12 months, raised and washed 1000 tons of alluvial, which
averaged 7dwts., the gold being worth a little over £4 an
oz. After paying ex.’s, this left a splendid return. The
party has another 1000 tons out, which, however, is not
expected to average over sdwts., and yet they are well
satisfied. The gold comes from what looks like the bed
of an ancient lake, about 100 ft. below the surface.
Vigorous prospecting has failed to pick up the lead out-
side this claim.

Gleisberg, late mananger of Half Mile Reef,
Bardoc, and of Lady Loch, Coolgardie (W.A.), has ful-
filled the predictions of the prophets by taking charge of
the Associated. Until Gleisberg gets into the run of
things, Hewitson is to remain and act as wetnurse. As
the Associated is almost on its last legs, and all known
ore bodies will be pretty well worked out by the end of
the year, the question of management is of little moment.
No pay ore has been found below 600 ft. level, but strenu-
ous efforts are being made to locate the continuation of
the Brown Hill-Iron Duke-Oroya chute. Looks now
as if the Australia East is the same lode thrown eastwards
by the upheaval of the Kalgurli Australia hill. A small
pocket of ore has been got at the 1050 ft. level, and may
be an indication of a lens. Exploration at this point is
being pushed ahead feverishly.
Ten heads of Bayley’s (W.A.) mill have made a
start on stone accumulated from recent exploration, so
that this mine, for a time at least, will help the gold pro-
duction of the State. The reef at 1000 ft. level has been
driven on for nearly 200 ft., and averages about sdwt. for
a width of sft. This is not much good, but improvement
is anticipated.

C. A. Saunders, new manager of Kanowna
Champion lode, is trying to make shareholders believe
that a leader, which yielded 22dwts. average, would pay,
if properly worked. As said leader runs nearly hori-
zontally between two duffer lodes, and entails shifting 10
tons of mullock for one of ore, and stone is hauled by
windlass, the expectation seems imaginative. Directors
blame late manager Don for crushing ldwt. ore, but the
facts are that, for two years Don refused to erect battery
bought from defunct wild-cat Carbine, and finally put it
up and crushed stone under directorial compulsion. So
far as proved, mine is an absolute cat, and was floated
to exploit mythical north lead lode.
* • * •
Manager Askin Nicholas, who retired from
Queen Margaret (W.A.), after the mine was practically
brought to a standstill, has quitted the Peak Hill, and
his place has been filled by R. Leslie Hall. Stacks of
“siller” have been spent in cabling ’Ome the great
potentialities of the mine, and this has managed to boost
scrip some 20s. The retirement of Nicholas should con-
vince the most sceptical that the time for handing over
the baby to one’s dearest friend has arrived.
• * * *
Sinking of the main shaft on the Associated
Northern (W.A.), will be resumed shortly. Developments
at No. 6 and 7 levels are still being pushed ahead, and
large bodies of rich ore are being opened up. The
accumulation of telluride ore now totals nearly 2500 tons,
and is worth at least £50,000. This lot is going to
Illawarra instead of Fremantle, as the local co. seems to
be in a comatose condition.

Ex-Mayor Tom Doyle, of Kanowna(W. A.), has
treated another 10 tons from his leader for 1720 z., bring-
ing up the total, for about three months’ work, to 1060 oz.
from 22J tons. This same leader put Doyle on his feet
some eight years ago, but he threw it up under the belief
that it had cut out, and only re-started when Dame
Fortune ceased to smile on him in business.

The licensing of gold-buyers has not panned out
up to prospects in the West, and the licences will most
likely be abolished. The Mint will, in that case, be the
sole buyer, with the banks (and it is suggested also the
post-offices) acting as agents for it.

The Anchor Consolidated, Tuckanara (W.A.),
one of the Zeb. Lane-Frank Gardner cats, was handed
over to tributors at the beginning of June, after two years
of fruitless work. Although no stone was in sight and
the workings were dangerous owing to mine being flooded,
the 23 tributors, backed by 20 wages-men, have already
got out and treated 300 tons of stone for 300 oz. Tribute
is for five years, so the men seem to have a good thing on.
The wages-men are being paid £4 13s. 4d. weekly—con-
siderably more than co. paid, but the men must work —
there’s no boss so strenuous as a working-man.

Three “seemingly valuable” discoveries have
been made in the Associated (W.A.), the most important
being at 1000 ft., where they are supposed to have struck
the continuation of the rich Northern Associated-Oroya
shoot.

The 10 cats held in W.A. by the Standard
Exploration Co. were recently offered by tender, and
(barring Hannan’s Golden Treasure, consisting of 81 acres,
adjoining the Golden Horseshoe on the south) have been
acquired by Birkbeck, Hoffmann and Jowett. Of the
litter, the Duke at Broad Arrow, Golden Crown at
Kanowna, Golden Dream and Golden Group at Kalgoorlie,
Mainland Consols at Lake Austen, Wealth of Nations and
Wealth of Nations Extended at Dunsville, and Paddington
South at Paddington have all been practically abandoned
as worthless. Paddington Consols at Paddington is
about the only mine that will be operated on by B. H.
and J. This property is equipped with a 40-head mill,
which used to treat about 4000 tons of 12-dwt. ore
monthly till it was closed down 18 months ago by the
Whitaker Wright smash. The buyer of the Golden
Treasure has not transpired, but it is probably the
Golden Horseshoe co. or Kaufman. No details of the
deals yet made public.

Golden Horseshoe (W. A.) last return of 16, lOloz.
from 1044 tons included 254 tons of 12oz. ore, despite
which the average grade showed a decline of lOdwt. per
ton. Value of yield at £3 12s. Bd. per oz., £58,500, which
should show a profit of at least £30,000, or (say) 2s. per
share. Mine still opening satisfactorily, and, so far as
one can judge, can maintain present returns for a long
time.

Golden Link Consols, Kalgoorlie (W.A.), a
rehash of four wild cats, has again come to the end of its
tether, and is in such sorry plight that directors have to
raise the wind for a further flutter by issuing £90,000 of
10 per cent, debentures at a discount of 25 per cent. This
means raising money at 12J per cent. Co. holds “ invest-
ments,” alleged to be worth £62,852, but, as these con-
sist of scrip in its offspring, Chaffers Extended, said
investments as an asset are an absolute farce. The raison
d’etre of the recent “discovery” of the 12ft. lode, worth
2oz. 4dwts. per ton on the Eclipse line, is now apparent;
100 tons of this wonderful stone is now being treated at
the Croesus battery, and the result will be awaited with
interest, if not with anxiety. Every effort will doubtless
be made to get at least one good return.

Long Reef Co., Lennonville (W.A.), first)
crushing of 915 tons from Galtee More lease, recently
acquired from I. V. Kearney for 16,600 reserve shares, and
£3400 cash, returned 45Soz. Co. previously held these
leases under option, but abandoned them, it is alleged,
on the recommendation of their engineers, only to re-
buy them at about three times the original figure. As
the stone only averages, lOdwts. the purchase does not
look a good one.

Associated Northern, Kalgoorlie (W.A.), hav-
ing resumed shipments of rich telluride ore to smelters,
some good returns may be looked for in the near future.
A specially picked parcel of 7 tons shipped to England
yielded 19760 z. gold. There is some talk of erecting *
plant on this mine, but nothing definite can be learn •
Strenuous efforts to bring about amalgamation are still
being made by the Brown Hill authorities.
Ida H., Laverton (W.A.), had a full run with
its treatment-plant last month, and produced 1028 oz.
from 850 tons, as against 7300 z. from 606 tons during May.
Cause of small May return was a break down. ims co.
has an issued capital of only £54,000, on which a 10 per
cent. div. was recently paid, and a further early discn iu-
tion is now looked for. Co. is controlled by John
Haddington, the “ Boulder King.”
Great Boulder (W.A.) is pushing on its no 8 ! 11
shaft, and very shortly exploration at 1000 ft. will be
initiated. Mine on the whole is opening well, but the
exploratiomof the continuation of thelvanhoe lodes from
Jansen shaft, on the north block, seems to be resulting
in the fiasco the diamond-drill foretold 18 months ago.
Unless the installation of the Merton furnaces materially
increases returns and reduces costs, divs. are unlikely to
show much, if any, enhancement.
v i* * *
According to its latest published return, the
Kalgurli (W.A.) cleared a monthly profit of £6OOO. This
result was, however, brought about by the practical
abandonment of development, as, out of total costs of
£6846, development figures for £237 only. As 3160 tons
were treated for 33050 z., the amount expended on de-
velopment is Is. 6d. per ton only, or one-fifth of the
Ivanhoe figure. R. S. Black, who long figured as manager
of this mine, has resigned, and Frank Moss, who really
managed the mine, now gets the sole credit or discredit.
The W.A. Mining and Oil Corporation seems to
have struck good “ile” in its 640-acre patch, Warren
River, near Cape Leeuwin. Boring operations were con-
ducted to a depth of 525 ft. through a formation said to be
very similar to the famdus Texas oil-field, But let the
discovery be as good as alleged, and what will be its
value ? Absolutely nil. Why ? Because .W.A. members
have combined with N.S.W. members in the. Federal
Parlt.,and have decided that the Standard Oil Co.. of
America shall have undisputed monopoly of the Australian
oil trade.

The owners of Payne’s (N.S.W.) process for
treating copper ores by leaching have applied for patents
all over the world. The secret of the process is in the roast-
ing of the ore—the complete sulphatising of the copper.
Patentees are satisfied that they have overcome this
difficulty, and talk about crushing and treating any class
of copper ore for less than the value of a unit of copper
per ton, with the advantage in the case of auro-cupriferous
ore that the tailings will be left in a perfect condition for
the recovery of the gold by amalgamation or cyanide.
They have arranged for the use of N.S.W. Govt, metal-
lurgical works at Clyde, and will give public demonstra-
tions of the working of the process on bulk parcels of ore.

Lord Nelson, St. Arnaud, is one of the standard
mines of Victoria. In a few weeks’ time it will get over
the £200,000 dividend mark. Zeb. Lane, sen., who has
managed the mine for nearly 20 years, assures share-
holders that it will pay divs. for years to come. Last
half-year 11,795 tons crushed for £24,421, or about £2
Is. 4d. per ton. Divs. paid £9OOO, or about 14s. 9d. per
ton. Working costs seem excessive. Cyaniding of tail-
ings does not show much profit—return, £1396; expenses,
£1309. With good equipment, mine should pay at least
10s. per ton more in divs. But an up-to-date plant would
mean a cessation of divs. for a few months, which share-
holders would not be likely to approve of.

Quartz Hill Co., Chewton, Vic., last half-year
won £3950 worth of gold at a cost of £3159. It sold
4475 trust shares for £lB7O. As stated by the chairman
on 22nd July the co. had £l2Bl 3s. 9d. on hand, out of
which it declared a 6d. div., or £l2OO. The div. is really
being paid out of capital, for had it not been for the pro-
ceeds of trust shares there would have been no div., and
the co. would have been £670 in debt. The board “in
future intends to pay a considerable sum out of the earn-
ings to a reserve fund.” The odd £Bl 3s. 9d. is a good
round sum to start with.

New Moou (Bendigo) record to the end of June :
Tons crushed, 267,345 ; gold, 104,7720 z. ; profit,
£145,075. Value of ore, £1 11s. per ton ; profit, 11s. No
call since 1890. Latterly co. has been paying better divs.
on 7dwt. dirt than it used to pay on 12dwts. Electricity
to be introduced for underground haulage to effect
further saving. Mine still in its infancy.

How little the Municipalities Act helps in
fixing the town-rate on mines is aptly illustrated by what
has this year happened to Broken Hill Block 14. The
municipal valuers assessed that mine to pay £358.. Under
threat of more law-proceedings, the council cut this down
to £215. The co. took an appeal to the local court, which
cut that down to £56. Of couree where such differences
are possible law-fights are certain.

The statue raised to the memory of the
late Baronet Clarke, of Victoria, the man who
was made famous by inheriting nearly all his
father’s money and spending some of it, has been
dumped on to perhaps the best site in all Mel-
bourne—at the main entrance to the Treasury
Gardens, top of Collins-st. The female figure in
the memorial is a fine, vital piece of work, carved
with the delicacy and strength that Mackennal so
signally possesses. It is not too great praise to
say that the sculptor has managed the drapery as
few modern artists have ever succeeded in doing.
The back of the girl is, perhaps, a trifle under-
modelled, and the figure of a boy seated at her
feet is not ideally successful. Mackennal’s effort
to secure an original pose leads to a clumsy appear-
ance from certain positions. The drapery, how-
ever, atones for all. The whole is a work of art
in the best sense of the word ; and, under the
circumstances, more’s the pity. It is a standing
jibe against Melbourne, this marble to a man who
was a man of money and nothing else. Mac-
kennal has not carved a single dollar into his
group to show that the stone is raised to the ever-
lasting glory of Spot Cash. At least, the first
baronet’s bust should have been hewn from gold-
bearing quartz.
BEFORE THE TAILORS HOARDING.
Liz.: “ Say, is there really blokes like that? ”
They put the other Clarke, the State Governor,
up to orate at the undraping of the statue of
“ Big ” Clarke 11. His Ex. knew nothing about
the deceased baronet, who died long before his
arrival here, but he dripped out what had been
Eoured into him with quite the touching air of one
ereaved, and enlarged copiously on the de-
parted’s many noble attributes —among them the
fact that he “ patriotically maintained half a
battery of horse-artillery.” Half a battery ! —how
ignoble do fractions look in a panegyric! Peacock,
K.C.M.G., also spoke a piece, mainly about the
benefioences of the gone-before baronet, whom
hardly anyone on earth knew anything about.
After which the company departed, leaving the
statue to be a marble mystery to a generation that
will never realise why so large a rook should have
been thrown at so small a man.

Re the reeent Redfern (Sydney) shooting
ease. The statement that the police have dis-
covered the identity of one of the desperadoes from
the detective office’s collection of photographs is
somewhat discredited by the remarkable readiness
of people in general to identify any photo., or
any person— for that matter. Present writer was
interested in & case in which half-a-dozen people
were shown a heap of widely-dissimilar photos.,
and, though the verdict was in no ease unanimous,
every individual photo, was identified by some
of the number as being that of the person
“wanted”—one man, indeed, thus “identifying”
every photo, of the pile.
Re the recent shooting of two policemen in
a Sydney suburb. The policeman’s revolver is a
foolish weapon. It is generally used to frighten a
man who is running away. If the law-breaker has
a pistol himself and doesn’t run off, the policeman
has no chance with his “gun,” for the criminal,
knowing what to expect, is ready first. And,
since the latter knows that, if caught, his shot, no
matter what the result, will mean hanging, he
may as well shoot to kill. It is all one price, so
long as the law idiotically punishes a constructive
attempt to murder as if it were murder itself.
Such a law, in fact, is in itself an incitement to
murder.

A pitiful sequel to the murder of Constable
Guilfoyle, by that desperate pair of coiners, was
the end of Joseph Heaps, a young fellow who,
whilst travelling the country in search of a living,
was surrounded by a party of scared bucolics,
under the leadership of Constable Madden, and
shot dead last week, at his camp-fire, on suspicion
of being Guilfoyle’s murderer. This tragedy hap-
pened in the Queanbeyan (N.S.W.) district, and
it is very hard to see how, even in Queanbeyan,
there could have arisen any suspicion against poor
Joseph Heaps, seemingly a thoroughly decent
fellow and the chief support of his widowed
mother.
He the shooting of Joseph Heaps, in mistake,
by some members of the police party, here is an
excerpt from an interview with the slaughtered
man’s mother:
. J° e was his father’s favorite, and when he was dying
in the hospital he specially asked for him. His father is
buried at Rookwood, and I would like him to be buried
there too. The police wanted me to let him be buried at
Queanbeyan, as there would be a lot of expense in bring-
ing the bodj' to Sydney. They asked me if I had enough
money to pay for it, but I said I hadn’t. I think they
ought to bring him down, don’t you ?
Tho meanness, the callousness of it! N.S.W.
owes a substantial money grant to the poor woman
as compensation for the loss of her bread-winner,
and should pay it without heckling.

The classics have provided instances of
man’s conspicuous devotion to his mother-in-law,
but a discovery of such mixed relationship in a
high circle of a certain Australian city comes as a
shock to most people. In this case the wife is
deserted for her youthful and more attractive
mamma. The husband is a leading light in his own
spheres. And now the worm turns —towards the
law-courts.

Yankee missioners Torrey and Alexander
have evidently got Hobart Mercury on their side,
and the poor old Devil is having a bad time in
consequence. Sample of Mercury reporting of
the variety-show run by the pushful gents with
the twang:
HOBART UNITED MISSION.
The Drama of Life in Three Acts.
The three meetings conducted by the American
evangelists yesterday were undoubtedly of the highest
order. At the noon day meeting in the Town Hall Dr.
Torrey continued his series of addresses on “ Why I
believe the Bible to be the Word of God.” We are of the
opinion that no more able defence of the Sacred Scripture
has ever been heard by a Tasmanian audience. ... A
magnificent congregation of men and women listened
with rapt attention to Mr. Alexander’s marvellous singing,
and.to Dr. Torrey’s clear-cut and telling discourse on the
subject of prayer. . . . The evangelists have made church-
going at all hours the most popular business in this city.
Mr. Alexander began to handle his vast choir with
exquisite skill, long before the service actually began. The
charm, and wonder, the skill and beauty of these choir
practices are things that will be for years and years trea-
sured as blessed memories in many a heart and many a hom e.
Christianity had its incarnation in the realm of music. . .
The preacher’s delineation of the desolation of a soul in
sin struck clean through into brain and heart. We saw
aged men bend their heads in confusion, as though they
had been there. We saw young faces appalled, as if by
the dreadful consciousness that they were hastening there.
Torrey’s definition of sin is “ Doing what you please.”
“ Whosoever wants to have his own way is a sinner.” The
end of that way is desolation, absolute' and awful. It is
the process that pulls a man’s coat from his back and
puts it on the publican’s back. It is the process by which
a man ultimately qualifies himself for “ A hog-tender to
the devil.” . . . The last scene was full of pathos and
beauty, representing the repentance of the prodigal; the
white-haired old man shading his eyes from the gleam of
the setting sun, as afar off on the horizon he sees the
wanderer returning ; the glad, grand embrace of love and
the kiss of peace : the smothered confession : the music
and the glorious revelry, above which sits Love in robes of
kingly splendor crowned with joy. The great congrega-
tion of more than 2000 human souls sat with bowed heads
while Alexander’s song, “ Where is my wandering boy to-
night,” thrilled, surely, every heart not yet dead to all
virtue.
For a secular paper this is distinctly not too bad.
Similar vermilion-tinted “reports” appeared in
the Mercury right through the Torrey season, all
of them more or less definitely suggestive of the
conversion of the editorial “we.” Folks were
amazed, and it was nightly expected that
Proprietor Davies (that isn’t his turf-name) would
rush to the penitent form and empty all his Bay
Eagle steeplechase winnings into Parson Torrey’s
capacious hat. But no such thing happened, and
Hobart is now divided as to whether the Mercury
has been “ pulling the public leg ” or whether
Torrey has been clever enough to jerk the
Mercury’s respected limb to make it dance like
that. As Torrey is understood to have done time
as a journalist the odds are on the latter propo-
sition.
Horrible thought! Torrey and co. are coming
to Sydney. Can the foregoing artfully-written
paragraph have been fixed up by their press-agent?
QUITS: A SALT CHESTNUT
ILLUSTRATED.
SQUAREHEAD SAILOR (throwing down a sovereign
so hard that it rebounds): “ Ya! yump, you
English one poun', yump! Das times was
many I yumped for you.”
A romance of real life that came rather
rough on the other woman. A wife from one of
the other States lately engaged a private detective
to search for the husband who deserted her 15
years ago. She had a mind to serve the long-lost
sinner with divorce papers, if he were discover-
able, but her scruples—she being R.C.—troubled
her considerably. In fact, the lady was still
hesitating at the divorce question when her agent,
after careful search, came along" with the news
that she was a widow of four days standing. The
missing man had been run to earth in the most
solemn sense of the term. He was buried the day
before. Death had dissolved the marriage, the
widow’s scruples were at rest, her husband had
died intestate, and she bore away his estate —
worth £2ooo—from right under the nose of the
unlawful relict!
* • * *
When all is said and done, the average
gentle shepherd misses a splendid lot of opportuni-
ties for getting into the Divorce Court. Probably
he is the most tempted mortal on earth, if he doesn’t
happen to be repulsively ugly. The actor, artist,
or any other sort of recognised Bohemian (includ-
ing the young man who calls for the rent) is a
particular mark for the advances of the
everyday flirty angel, whereas the parson
has to suffer the temptations of a particu-
lar tribe of Delilahs and Potiphar’s wive 3
who lie in wait for him alone. And the
women who wouldn’t think of “falling” unless
the Church were concerned in the tumble, are
probably a more dangerous class than even the
moderately serious sisterhood that inclines towards
medical men. Of course no journalist can speak
positively on this point. One must be right in
the know— i.e., in the “ cloth ” —to be an authority
re the wiles of the ladies who want their cup of
salvation tea to be sugared with a little bit of sin.

Ten years ago, on July 3, the big three-
months’ strike began at Broken Hill, and the
bitterness of it is still in many mouths. Even
now there is no party cry half so effective among
Broken Hill laborites as ‘ ‘ Remember ’92 ! ” and
every few weeks somebody or other, who has got
into a hot argument, spends half-a-crown in
asserting, in the local paper, that he didn’t “ black-
leg ” during the trouble. To accuse a Broken
Hill mine-workman of that is still to accuse him
of worse than anything which the law punishes.
• * * *
Ifc was the long arm of coincidence which
lately guided the Broken Hill Miners’ Association
to send in their claim to the Arbitration Court on
the 10th anniversary of the start of the great ’92
strike—July 3. Defeated in the strike, the con-
tract system was forced on the men, and a wage-
cut followed. The men’s application is for a new
contract agreement and a return to the wage-scale
of ’92. The co.’s have been consulting with a
view to hitting back with a petition to cancel the
registration of the Miners’ Association, on the
ground that it has rules of a character similar to,
but more obnoxious than, the political rules of the
A.W.U. Meantime the Miners’ Association is
hurrying up with a revision of its code.

T’other morning, as a Lavender Bay (Syd-
ney) ferry-steamer drew up to Circular Quay, a
boy, jumping not wisely but too soon, took a
bath ; whereupon a man cast himself—hat,
umbrella, pipe, morning paper and all-over the
side and fell in right on top of the boy as he
rose for the first time. The two disappeared,
then rose again ; and the man, whose natatory
powers were not equal to his pluck, was seized by
the boy, and towed by the hair of his head to the
wharf-side. Amidst great applause from the
spectators, the would-be rescuer was landed in
good order and condition, but very wet, and minus
his dignity, hat, paper, pipe, and umbrella.
Certain forenoon trams from

then made to realise the situation,
whimpers dolefully. “ Pooh ! that’s

“look at this ittle boy, ’e’s got to
go through a worse one.” “Wot’s th’ matter
with ’im ? ” asks Tommy’s guardian. “ Oh, ’e’s
got something wrong with ’ees bowels.” And
then follows a cheerful dissertation on entrails,
which makes two wretched kids wish they’d never

An interesting document is a circular by
Mr. F. Webster, sec. of N.S.W. “Royal” Agri-
cultural Society, appealing for subscriptions for
“ a testimonial of a lasting character to the Hon.
Sir John See, K.C.M.G., M.L.A.” Sir See is
president of the Agri. Society aforesaid; he is
also Premier of the State ; and that possibly helps
to explain why the Society is allowed to hold an
area of public park and to spend a huge public
subsidy, simply for the purpose of catering for the
public amusement in a not-too-creditable fashion.
But why should the public—already victimised
by the mis-use of its park and of its subsidy—have
the salt rubbed in by a begging appeal for guineas
for the rich John See ?

There was a very remarkable defence to a
Ballarat (Vic.) maintenance case the other day.
The girl’s yarn was that, she was a domestic ser-
vant in the house of an elderly Christian with an
invalid wife and grown-up family. He seduced
her, she said, and the intimacy continued
at his house and elsewhere in Ballarat. In
Feb, 1901, they went to Melbourne together
and occupied the same room. A year later she
gave birth to a baby. Her elderly friend had
meanwhile helped to get her into a refuge, from
whence she wrote him, under an assumed name,
but couldn’t get him to take up the responsibilities
of an illegitimate father. The girl’s chief witness
was the shepherd of the Bible Christian Church
which had brought all parties concerned into
communion. The shepherd said “he had seen
undue attention paid by defendant to plaintiff.”
Then the elderly Sunday-school teacher told his
yarn. He denied having been amorous with his
handmaiden, but admitted that she went to Mel-
bourne with him. He didn’t want to travel per
same train as the spinster. It was she 'who took
him in hand, saying “I’m going to stay where
you are, and nowhere else.” They found accom-
modation at a small hotel where there was but one
spare bedroom, with two beds in it. He lay down
on one bed, clothed and in his moral mind, whilst
the damsel lay on the other. No impropriety
occurred, and at break of day he arose and left
his persistent young friend sleeping the sleep of
innocence. Some months later, when the forth-
coming event was being talked about, he protested
to the brethren that he had been the unfortunate
victim of circumstances. The case looked sus-
picious, but he couldn’t help that. The girl got him
alone in Melbourne and refused to leave him.
So far, things looked blue for the elderly pietist,
it being a maxim of law that if two adults of
opposite sexes sleep in the one room something is
to be pr-esumed (unless they happen to beman and
wife). But the next witness, a son of defendant,
aged 21, put a different complexion on things.
Sonny deposed that once when he was walking
home from Sunday-school with plaintiff she
amorously assaulted him, and the subsequent
results were sinful. Also an elder brother testi-
fied to having susoected the last witness of
dalliance with the damsel nine months previous to
the birth of her baby. Hearing all these things,
the Ballarat East Bench decided that the paternity
of this Sunday-school child was not proven, and
they advised the police to inquire into the
mysteries of the case, and discover who had com-
mitted perjury.
* * * *
The Ballarat Sunday-school superinten-
dent’s story of how he took the female teacher to
Melbourne and she wouldn’t leave him, although,
as a shocked superintendent, he wanted badly to
get rid of her, showed that he wasn’t a man of
resource. In a large city like Melbourne, if a
superintendent finds a Sunday-school teacher
persistently walking alongside him with sinful ends
in view, and he doesn’t want to call the police,
there are plenty of ways out of the difficulty.
The most gentlemanly way is to walk straight on
till he reaches St. Kilda, then back through Prahran
to Richmond and thence to Northcote, and,
if she is still along with him, to walk from North-
cote to Port Melbourne, and next to Footscray,
and if he hasn’t lost her by that time, to walk
from Footscray to Kensington, and North Mel-
bourne and Carlton and Brunswick, and then
make swiftly into Collingwood—by which time
an utterly wrecked teacher with her boots worn
off her feet will have fainted in the roadway and
been left behind. Another idea is to go into a
Turkish bath and start taking off his clothes.
If she is waiting on the pavement when he comes
out he can go into a barber’s and get his hair cut.
If she is waiting when he comes out with his hair
cut he can go into a hotel and start drinking. If
that doesn’t shake her off, the next idea is to go
into a dentist’s, and, if she accompanies him there,
to tell the dentist to extract four of her teeth.
Someone or other of these proceedings would
surely bring about a climax. Another idea is to
ride about the city in trams, and, if the lady
follows, make her pay her own fares till she is
“ broke,” and is at last put off the tram, or run-in ;
by getting off immediately the conductor has
collected the 3d. the cost of tram-riding can
be run up to 7s. 6d. an hour. Also, a superin-
tendent can simply run for it with his coat-tails
flying in the wind, and the Sunday-school teaching
lady left hopelessly in the rear. If he wants a
good start he can take the lady into a boot shop
and tell her to select a 275. pair, and fly as soon
as she has taken her boots off to try the other ones
on. He can walk through the West Melbourne
swamp, where she can’t follow him ; in fact,
there are lots of ways.
And this superintendent says that ho did none
of these things; he allowed the lady to follow
him to a hotel, and she forcibly stayed
all night in his room. He didn’t get out
of the room ; he stayed there too, and lay awake
all the time dwelling upon the horror of the
situation. He was a woefully helpless and un-
enterprising superintendent.

Rude man is interested to observe that
the fat woman of Sydney block has ‘ ■ stowed her
bingey”—per aid of the new Yankee “straight-
fronted corset,” a high priestess whereof, with the
most lovely twang ever heard, lately arrived from
the land of wooden hams, on a fat-compressing
mission. The fat woman’s front adiposity
has mostly disappeared, but where it has gone to
is an anatomical puzzle. However, from the
queer waddle she has taken on, it would seem that
the erstwhile fat party does not feel altogether
comfortable when she tries to walk.

“H.A.M.”: Some of Sydney’s most resi-
dential suburbs abound with crumbling houses
only a few years old. I know of a man who has
gone bankrupt because he couldn’t sell quickly
enough a lot of houses built on sand. Some houses
are built entirely of used bricks, and I know of
one cottage that is being built with a half-brick
wall. Badly wanted, an effective Building Act.

Unto matrimonial cares—
Scrubbing boards and kitchen chairs ;
I never had much leaning, if you please,
But a gleam of new romance
Comes my feelings to entrance
With the crowning of the King beyond the seas.
Bugler Love goes tootle-toot,
Beats my heart a proud salute,
And the windows of my soul illuminate;
Shows my cheek its loyal red
For my own particular Ned,
And our marriage is a Coronation FSte.
He.
When I hear the joy-bells ring
For a far-off Queen and King,
They lend a grander meaning to my bliss ;
And I feel my love expand
To the confines of the land
As I greet you with a large imperial kiss.
It makes our future seem
Like a vast imperial dream
Like a Pageant, a Parade, a Grand Review !
I was happy all jpy life,
Never wishful for a wife,
But I want to own an Empire, and that’s you.

A man who evidently repented at leisure,
and left room for others to repent leisurely also,
was Charles Gilheany, who died in Melbourne in
’97. His will was only lodged lately, there being
apparently an all-round gradualness, not to say
dilatoriness, about the Gilheany family. Most of
testator’s estate consisted of a few square yards of
land right alongside Goldsbrough, Mort and Co.’s
place in Bourke-st. This is now valued at £400, but
in the boom days G.M. and Co. offered £10,000 for
it. Gilheany refused, and waited long for the
offer to be raised. The rise never came ; but even
in death he never lost hope. His will specified
that a nephew was to have the rents arising from
the block for 50 years, but was not to sell it for
less than £10,000 plus £1000 for every year since
testator’s death, so that in 1947 he can take
£60,000 for the property. Gilheany doesn’t seem
to have cared what happened to the land after 50
years.

The two Southern capitals have recently
supplied an electrocution-sensation apiece. In
Melbourne, a young fellow was aloft at 3 a.m.,
attending to an arc-light at the railway-station,
when a live wire came his way. He was found
hanging among the wires, quite dead. The
Hobart aff lir was equally startling, though the
victims were horses. One of the cross-wires of
the electric tramline broke adrift, and hung in a
loop over the roadway. The obstacle was not
visible in the dark, the coach-horses ran their
heads into the loop, and fell dead. Had the wire
hung a foot higher, it would have missed the
horses and—there were three persons on the box-
seat of the coach.

It is more than suspected that there is
often a lot of hanky-panky in
N.S. W. in connection with the
sale of property by Govt,
officials. A recent case : in
a bankrupt estate certain
goods, worth (say) £60,
were advertised to be sold.
Two persons anxious to
secure them, and ready to
bid up to £50, inquired as
to the time of sale, and on
turning up punctually
found that the articles had
been knocked down for £3
to a bidder two hours
before. There is strong
presumptive evidence there
of crooked collusion to sell
goods at much under their
real value, to the loss of the
State or of the creditors of a
bankrupt estate. The matter
should be brought before
Parliament.
Dissatisfaction with the management of
the Queen Victoria Scholarship for Women ia
raging in Sydney. The fact that the aid of mere
man was invoked at the initial meeting vexes the
soul of the New Woman. One of her speaks:
“The Victoria Scholarship which is in honor Of
a woman, intended For women, originated By
women-, by means of subscriptions From women,
should be done With the help of women only.
Speeches by a few sensible, sober women would
have been of more value than the drunken
maunderings of politicians.” The New Woman’s
efforts to reform the world are frequently inter-
rupted by a wild rush to shoo off the man who
wants to help reform. It is an illogical attitude,
betraying a consciousness of inferiority—this
jealousy of male assistance.

Adelaide is very sorry to lose the Tenny-
sons. H. E. has only made one political mistake
worth mentioning in his term of office; and his
wife has been equally at home in agitating for (and
getting) a maternity hospital, or in putting the
blue ribbon round a Derby winner’s neck. Both
have been geniality itself to all comers. Not a
breath of scandal has touched Government House
under their rule; and this (though many of the
bygone scandals were very probably unfounded) is
more than can be said of any predecessors there
for 20 years or so back.

Then he turns his attention to the catch-
ing of floating wood, and gets enough
for domestic use. Occasionally a young

rat-corpses were worth 3d. each.

The Brisbane project of a co., with £5000
capital, to run a motor-car passenger-service
between Brisbane and Rockhampton is an inte-
resting one. Present proposal is to run four cars,
each with a capacity of 16 to 20 passengers ; two
to leave each city daily. There is a vast virgin
field of usefulness in Australia awaiting the motor-
car, and, if the present proposal has any success,
other ventures will rapidly follow. A swift,
regular service of cars, of about 10 passengers and
mail capacity, running, say, from Bourke to
Moree or Narrabri via Walgett, or from Cobar to
Hay via Condobolin, or direct, would do away
with changing stations right through, and should
pay handsomely on an expended capital of £4000
or £5000.

Bishop Goulburn deprecates the Australian
habit of calling the mother “old woman.” The

our ghostly comforters ?

Edward Moore, aged 75 years, was lately sentenced
at Sydney, to four years’ “ hard ” for house-
breaking. At the outset of his career, in Victoria,
he got 10 years for highway robbery ; later on he
served two sentences of seven and eight years
respectively for robbery under arms ; after which,
in N.S.W., he, by various offences, compiled a
further gaol record of 20 years, apart from 12
months extra for attempting to escape. Early in
1901 the veteran retired to Rookwood Benevolent
Asylum, but, emerging on June 26 with an aged
colleague to view the Coronation celebrations, the
ruling passion recurred, and “ up ” he goes again.
Moore’s prison-career totals 45 years.
Vic. Acting - Commissioner of Railways
Fitzpatrick, in a recent report, proves that the
swagger military person—and, in a less degree,
the rifle-club person —have been defrauding the
State wholesale by abusing their “free-pass ” con-
cession. The Act provides that Every per-
son engaged to serve in the naval and military
forces, if in uniform, or carrying a rifle, shall be
conveyed free to and from all musters, drills,
parades, and rifle practice, over the Victorian
railways.” So whenever any unspeakable beer-
and-bluster warrrior wants to go anywhere on any
business, he first puts on his rifle and swagger,
and robs his country by travelling free. The
Commissioner shows that on such holidays as
Cup-day the fraud is at its worst.

rights for the local district. Then there was a
rush for “rights!” Next, a few trainloads of
Sydney unemployed, armed with ration-orders,
were dumped on to the spot. These had to get
work, but the others were not wanted. _ Conse-
quently, there are hundreds of men, many in actual
distress, begging for work, and the Owo’S. says he
cannot put any more on.

A WOMAN’S LETTER.
~ . Sydney, July 29, 1902.
My Dear Arini.—
Our ex-Governor Lord Beauchamp was married
last week to Lady Lettice Grosvenor, at Eccles-
ton, which, by the way, is the family burving-
place of the Beauchamp family. He will take his
bride on a long honeymoon tour to India, where
T™ r^ ther m T la f’ f° rd Am P fchill > the Governor
of Madras. Lady Mary Lygon, it is cabled, will
accompany the honeymooners. It is not usual to
take your relatives with you on your wedding
tour ; though a certain Australian M.P. took his
gilded mother-in-law to Japan with him when he
went on his honeymoon—probably as an evidence
of good faith. Lady Mary, thougli most amiable,
doesn t look as though she would sympathise with
tlie cooing neath the ivory moonlight of married
chairs’ ° r Wlt 1 tbe c l° se Proximity of their deck-
Brand, a daughter of N.S.W.’s ex-Gover-
nor Hampden, is engaged to Capt. Feildea, who
used to be her father’s A.D.C. Another Brand
girl, you may remember, also married an A.D.C.,
Gapt Ferguson, during her father’s term of office.
Ihe bridegroom was a Lifeguardsman and was
1 2 T uni f°™ a > cuirass “glittered ”so in
the oJVI. Herald s account of the ceremony that
the affair was immortalised as the Great Monkev-
iSoap Wedding.
Ada Reeve, of “French Maid’’fame, has re-
married the husband whom she divorced, Bert
Gilbert. jSow isn’t that a sheer waste of law-
expenses ? It is to be hoped that the pretty little
vital spark Ada won’t make a habit of this
divorcing and re-marrying of the same man, for
tear the decree-nm judge, who is not paid by
piece-work but by the year, may turn cranky and
put snags in the way.
Jean Gerardy with his Stradivarius ’cello
opened to a poor house at Sydney Town Hall last
week. Musical stars are having a bad time here
financially. The Angel Israfel himself, who
must be something of a virtuoso as his heart-
strings are a lute, might draw a full Town Hall
these days, but just think of the Influence he
could command. Gerardy, coming on to the plat-
form, looks much younger than the flame-tinted
portraits of him that are stuck about the city •
leaving the platform he looks years older.’
Same with Max Schliiter, who, after he has played
a lot of his own vitality through his violin, looks
forty. Gerardy’s ears are set low like those of a
cocker spaniel, and are at an unusual angle : per-
haps this means ’cello genius. He has the true
musician s face with the full lips, deep-socketed
eyes, and prominent brows.
Miss Electa Gifford’s soprano is not as beautiful
as her figure. If it were like her shoulders and
neck it would be perfect. I like the little
olumber bong she gave for an encore—poppies
in it the swaying of the cradle, the rustle of the
mothers gown m the deepening dusk, Foote’s
Irish Folk Song” she also sang. Amy Castles
gave it to us frequently, but Miss Electa warbled
it with a difference. The three notes which Amy
used to sing so staccato Miss Electa lingered over
and let die slowly Her gown, around the
lower half of the skirt, was a fresco of silver
on black, and the artist’s intention was to
suggest a woodland pool by night, reeds and
grasses on the margin, big moths and glow-worms
on the surface. The intention did not mis-
carry. Herr Gottfried Galston, the pianist,
played Schumann’s Sonata in G Minor, which is
about as easy as Chinese metaphysics, and is
three-quarters of a mile long. So, after the
audience had listened intently for the first quarter
it began to cough and scrutinise each other’s
clothes, and wonder why musicians are never
bald. Ihe professional musicians present said
a , w “ ' vell P ] , a y ed - Herr Gottfried
pedals differently from other musicians whose feet
Ive noticed. He lifts his foot bodily, or, rather
tootily, quite level and very swiftly. Miss Gif-
ford s singing of the “ Mad Scene ” from “ Ham-
let at a later concert was really as perfect as her
ligure. And her gown was champagne shade with
woven gardens of pink roses.
One of the frustrated coronators who .jas
returned, chats of dress in London: “All the
women who pay 30 or 40 (or more) guineas each
for their dresses seem to wear black. Perhaps
three or four beautiful materials, patterned and
stitched and cut into one gown, demanding a
frightful lot of needlework—but all black. Veils
—I haven t seen the sort out here yet—two layers
of diaphanous something (for instance, pinkish
chiffon one side and a net with black chenille
spots the other), run to two guineas each. But
what gives the wandering Australian a shock is
to see a leader of society dressed for motoring

awful sea-monstensh appearance. You know
how dirty you get if you stand half-an-hour
on the platform of the Sydney-Melbourne express
Well, motoring at the rate of 40 or more miles per
hour grimes a woman equally, so the motor woman
wears great grey goggles, which are sewn-in to
thick gossamer veils to protect her eyes against
wind and dust, then a visor of talc is fixed onto
her toque projecting in front of the face from
above the eyes and below the chin. Foal-skin
coats—nothing could be uglier-are worn and the
prices are from twenty to fifty guineas each,

I found a lot of her a living fact. Wealthy
women seem to have one dominant idea, and
that is to retard signs of age. The oreatest

European war I went away, as you know, in
September, and, with the exception of the week I
was out of London, we had only four days on
which we could dress without the electric light.”
An American lady visitor is just now paralysing
an Australian hotel with her splendid presence
and the gowns in which she drapes it. She is
very tall, very well-developed, about 40, with a
dead-white skin and black hair, and she sweeps
into the dining-hall with a Columbia-hails-Aus-
tralia sweep, trailing yards of crimson velvet and
priceless lace. One of her tailor-mades is a
cream cloth, embroidered with gold. But
the humor of the why of her being here:
‘‘ I spent two thousand pounds on clothes
for my wife in Paris,” explains the husband, “and
just then a relative of hers must go and die, and
throw her into mourning, so I said, ‘ Let us go to
Australia, where no one knows us, and your
clothes won’t be wasted.’”
Tempe Hospital Ball realised £250, which is
splendid, considering the competition in charity
dances. Vincent’s Hospital hop will bring in
some £5O more. One feature of the latter
affair was a wonderful overskirt, embroi-
dered with beetles’ wings. You know
the shiny metallic - green of those wings.
| ( n the very first novel I read, Charles Reade’s
‘ Hard Cash, ” mention was made of a dress
trimmed with beetles’ wings, and for the next few
years I collected the wings of dead beetles until I
had a pickle-bottle half-full. Then a brother stole
them and sprinkled them on a glued kite. One
girl made a chromatic sensation with two great
bunches of turquoise and pink chiffon on her cor-
S -u\ e ’ nearl y enough to make a gown. Tulle or

a fancy pin-cushion effect.
1 heir Excellencies Rawson and daughter visited
the P.P.C. and D. Show which His Ex. opened,
to orchestral effects of cackling, crowing, trilling
and barking. . I should imagine that it was the
first show their Exes, have visited at which the
principals, and all the rank and file, wore their
own natural feathers and hair. In one case thecolor
was not real—anoriginally-whitefowlhadbeendyed
rose-pink and labelled the “Coronation Hen.” She
was very angry-looking a-nd was quite tired trying
to wash herself with the limited means at her
disposal—her beak and that silly little nib of a
tongue with which a hen is handicapped. The
Governor bought an Australian terrier, and Lady
and Miss patted many friendly bow-wows on the
organ of veneration. His Ex.’s father was a very
ooggy man, beagles being his fancy.
Two Missus and Mary Jane stories told by the
Missus : “I engaged a maid named Pearl, and as
I simply couldn’t ask a Pearl to fill the coal-
scuttle or holy-stone the doorstep I said, ‘I would
rather call you by some other name ; have you a
second one ? ’ ‘ Yes,’ replied the damsel, brightly,
my second name is Opal.’ So I stuck to Pearl.
At one time I had all but engaged a maid named
Hernnone, but upon asking her, ‘ Have you a
black dress, white caps and aprons?’ ‘Yes, I
have,’she replied acidly, ‘but I’m not going to
wear them. Ma didn’t christen me ’Ermione for
to wear a livery. 5 55
What is the idea of the hands-behind-the-oack
pose so much affected lately by large women and
thin women ? It suits only a very good, slender
figure, and does not harm the effect of a very
thin one, but for a large woman—and we have
such a lot of large young women, in every ball-
room—with very obvious hips, it is—well, there
is something about it that makes me think of a
whale s calf standing on its tail.
Writes my Brisbane correspondent:—
“To celebrate the first visit of Admiral Beau-
mont to Brisbane waters, Vice-Royalty enter-
tained at one of the old come-as-you-please, out-
door afternoon fetes. The Governor and his
sister-in-law, Miss Webb, received the deep curt-
seys of the initiated and the little pinchbeck bobs
of the novices, on the lawn. His Ex. cultivates
an altogether charming manner, seldom forgets
a face, and manoeuvres cleverly, when there is a
lapse of memory, to put on an old-friend air.
1 here is a great race for the epauletted attaches ;
two of Brisbane’s beauties annexed officers of the
last squadron, and ‘ there’s no saying where a
blister micht licht I ’ The one discordant element
was that, at the express wish of the Governor and
Lady Chermside, no names of the guests at the
party are to be published. An excellent snob-
suppression idea. But Captain Harman, A.D.0.,
enjoyed a bad quarter of an hour in consequence
from those who like themselves well-printed.
Writes my Melbourne correspondent:—
“ Gov. _ Clarke, though a military martinet to
fookat, hides a soft heart under his buckram. In
the Town Hall, t’other evening, when he handed
the Humane Society awards to their winners, he
hung down his head and winked the tears out of
his eyes when the ‘death-roll of honor’ was read
out, including the names of two little girls, one
aged o, the other 12, who had been drowned trying
to save baby-brothers. His own only chick is a
daughter, so no doubt pa has a soft spot for
youngsters of the ‘ coaxing sex,’ especially as one
of the gallant children was named ‘ Ethel ’ —his
own piccaniny’s title.
“ This year’s winners of awards for vaior seemed'
just as shy and unconceited as those of former
occasions. The young fellow who had risked the
double horror of being drowned and crushed be-
tween ship and pier to save a stranger’s life,
writhed neath the gaze of the Town Hall
gathering ; so did a slip of a lad from Dayles-
ford (Vic.) who had made desperate efforts
to rescue the inmates of a burning house,
several policemen had turned out to be

“Mr. and Mrs. Robert Harper had the luck to
travel to Vancouver by the same boat as the ex-
Gov.-General. Some of the smartest have never
forgiven the briskly-conversational Mrs. Harper
the fact that, during the Little Duke’s visit, she
was selected for a special introduction to _ the
Duchess, on the grounds that she was the Kirk’s
most representative daughter.
“ The nervousness of the politician at a ‘ social ’
ceremony is often thought to be surprising, though
it is a recognised characteristic of his twin-brother,
the stage actor. Puthim in his congenial position of
a political performer, and your M.P. has the con-
fidence, intrepidity, and self-assurance of an
Alexander. But introduce the petticoat element,
perfume the air with French floral essences, and
lo ! Alexander trembles at the knees ; his hands,
which rule continents, lose their confidence, and
his wits go wool-gathering. This was noticeable
at the Acting Gov.-Gen.’s swearing-in the other
week. Big, burly C. C. Kingston leaned on one
foot, then the other, and ended in a wide grin
at his own sense of awkwardness. The O’Connor
threw his Senatorial chest out bravely, but fid-
getted, and wore an air of painful restraint. And
so did most of the impatient orators of the House,
Alfred Deakin alone excepted. But what could
possibly trouble that self-contained young-old
man ? He has something of the parson in his
style, and the parson is always at his ease among
women.
“The M'Eacharn clan are forward with

Chippendale furniture for the lacquered and

many homes are filled with ‘ the latest novelties ’

‘ The humor of the Japanese furnishing of our
social lights is that it delights in a profusion of
the cheap, the tawdry, and the glaring. It may
be the fashion of the Jap. bazaar in a cheap quar-
ter at Tokio, but certainly has no kinship with
the wonderfully-artistie interiors of the homes of
educated Japs. Those are marked by a restrained
aestheticism and a paucity of ornament, which, to

“ Celia Ghiloni, whose vulgar role as the
snarling * Old Dutch of the circus proprietor, is
a tremendous clnnb-down from lolanthing in
fairy splendours at her Majesty’s skittish show,
turns out in superfine style off the boards these
days. She lit upon a tea-room, the other day, in a
dream of violet glory. Her present part in the
‘ Circus Girl ’ is a strain on her voice, her wits,
and her presence of mind. The effort to sustain a
most unsuitable role is painfully visible, and
those who were rather taken with the Celia’s
fascinations, when, Aphrodite-like, she rose from
her watery bed, and waved her wand upon the
earth, squirm at the present sight of her in a
greasy velvet gown, a lop-sided island of a hat,
with flaring white feathers, and an Arriet-like
voice and harpy manner.
‘May Beatty tells interviewers and friends
that she feels sorry Melbourne gets but a vulgar
, impression of ner in the present performance.
Carmenita, ’ she says, was deep-down comedy
enough, but ‘ Fi-Fi’ is lower still, and blithesome
May prays for a really nice part to set her on
refined heights again. "Clowns—male or female-
all alike, want to play Hamlet.
“ While May Beatty’s boldness and brightness
nave grown apace with the nights of the Chinese
Honeymoon, Josephine Stanton languishes and
droops till her tired-feeling becomes positively
infectious. Even her pet warble about the ‘ Dainty
Darling Dimple ’ has waned in expression and
range. As the Princess, she bears a passing
resemblance to Ada Willoughby in the last
jewelled pantomime, but she gave us all Ada’s
effortless performances and none of the little
woman’s winsomeness. There was an indefinable
charm about Ada’s treacled tootle of ‘ My Daddy’s
a Gentleman,’ and as Josephine Stanton really
boasts a dainty, darling dimple of her own, she
should put some of its charm into her catchy
warble.
“Talking of the amateur ‘Runaway Girl per-
formance (and in stage-struck circles they are
still talking about it), the name-part was not quite
unsuccessfully grappled with by a Sandring-
ham lady, a sweet-voiced little thing. Miss
Abbott, who took Carrie Moore’s part, is also a
Sandringham product, a youngster of 17 or there-
abouts, and the best little dancer in a crowd whose
darlcing was a respectable all-round apology for
their lack of sound. Some of them couldn’t even
talk audibly. Miss L. Lugg, the pretty daughter
of a dentist, reproduced Grace Palotta on a
smaller scale, even to the cracked note m her
voice, and the accent. The notion of an imitation
Palotta straining after the foreign accent of the
original in this very English character is
surely the funniest notion that ever possessed an
amateur mummer mind.
“ Some amateur mummers scored conquests in
a recent musical show, and the engagement of one
of the leading brunettes is a result of her skittish
stage strut—in abbreviated skirts. On the whole,
the revelation afforded by the brief petticoats was
a disenchanting one, and the discovery was made
of famine calves in nearly every instance. The
only one of the co. with substantial supports used
to flaunt them before the other girls behind the
scenes, and leave the owners of the frail props in
high dudgeon. This is feminine nature all over—
vanity in excess matched by envy in excess.
“The path of a recent amateur Society show
was strewn with many thorns. The dress com-
petition was a sharp one. The frock of one dainty
Miss cost 18 guineas. This was a bad precedent,
for another good member with many physical
points was prevented wearing a serviceable but
cheap costume, on the score of incongruity.
Frocks were to be merely decorative, not practi-
cal, and all the pretty show-girls of the co. had to
scale the heights of extravagance, just because the
wealthiest girl had started off with the most
luxurious and useless chiffons.
A charmer who showed most expensive under-
frills was giving her wed ding-trousseau treasures
a preliminary airing. How does this strike the
sentimentalist ?
“Moral philosophers advance a reason for a
certain comic opera girleen, of no parts but what
the daintiest dressing gives her, securing all the
laurels of a big drum-banging show. They say
the tricky one has all her Johnnies, like so many
poached eggs, on toast, and delays her choice of
the lot to secure greater manifestations of worship
from the sighing swains who struggle for a mono-
poly of her smiles and affections.
“ ‘ Novel’ teas have broken out again badly in
Melbourne. Judge Molesworth’s wife negotiated
one the other day, at which Capt. Browning, the
tootling aide of Gov. Clarke, scored a point or
two. The chubby warrior appeared with a long
list of Argus birth-notices pinned to his coat.
All the girls stood round him, blushing and
giggling, and afraid to venture guesses over such
a delicate matter, till one rushed in with ‘The
Newcomes.’ She had guessed right the very first
time.
“Electa Gifford—the songstress of Gerardy’s
concert party—tells an interviewer that, while
visiting Samoa, she was asked by a native chief if
she and a girl companion were married. On
answering in the negative, the chief cordially and
instantly invited the two charmers to pitch their
tents in sunny Samoa. “He really wanted us to
stay,” ingenuously added the radiant Electa.
“The marriage of Miss Alice Climpton and Mr.
Clive Macartney, at St. Thomas’, Essendon, last
Wednesday, drew all the feminine flutterers of the
N. W. district. The bride is a daughter of one of
Melbourne’s rich millers, and the incidental splen-
dour was up to the high-water mark of fashion.
The pearl and ivory raiment revelled in mountings
of good lace and chiffon. Three good-figured brides-
maids showed how effectively ficelle lace shows
up on ivory silk foundations. A few blush-pink
roses peeped forth from dainty toques. Of course
the cascade dip of lace at the back was a feature of
each chic toque. All the guests sported millinery
brought up-to-date by streaming velvet ends down
the back.
“ A certain bright little comedienne does Col-
lins-st. occasionally with a wealthy American
resident whom the Society girls have failed season
after season to bait. The Johnnies of The Block
think it ‘ a case.’
“ Senator O’Connor took an affectionate farewell
of Acting-Prime Minister Deakin at the closing of
the Senate’s shutters for a month. Often o’ fine
mornings the Sydney Ajax takes a brisk walk to
South Yarra, there to enjoy his coffee-roll with
Alfred the Didactic, and chat over the day’s pro-
gramme. No cobwebs on their brains at 8 a.m.—
light consumers of victuals and viands, they revel
in sound hearts and strong nerves, and are equal,
either of them, to 16 hours’ work at a stretch,
allowing an interval for a tray-snack.
“There were ructions in a Collins-street tea-
room, t’other day, over the introduction to ‘the
staff ’of an ex-housemaid. A customer recognised
the Hebe as an old servant, and indignantly scat-
tered the news among the smart graces of the
tray. They formed a deputation to the pro-
prietress, declaring their disgust and refusal to
work with a ‘ menial ’; and, although she bore an
excellent character, she had to march off. Which
beautifully illustrates the chance that any woman,
however refined, has of rising in Society if ever
she commits The One Unpardonable Sin —that of
becoming a ‘slavey.’ That, after all, is the only
unpardonable sin in a woman.
“Talking of music. The washer-lady, the
mangier, and the multitude of stitching sisters
move Heaven and earth to have themselves or
their bairns taught the pianoforte. There is one
story in robust circulation to the effect that a
serving- woman offered laundry assistance in return
for the five-finger exercise on the Ronisch. That
about takes the palm. But everyone has personal
experience of the stitching-she who offers two
days’ needle-dodging a week in return for music-
lessons ; and the palmist, the pedagogue in petti-
coats, and the manicurist, who offer their services
for ‘ Nelly Bly ’ tunings and chromatic scalings.
An advt. in the Argus, the other day, held out
the enticing offer of poker-instruction in return
for music-lessons.

continue, male humanity is becoming

The Bulletin regrets to hear it reported
that its old friend Gentleman One is missing with

Acting-Governor-General Lord Tennyson
completes hi® first half-century of life on Tuesday,
Aug. 12; Lord Ranfurly, Governor of M.L., will

Colonel Tom Price, at just on 60 years of
age, goes to Queensland as Commandant, when
several long resident officials of Queensland are
getting the run for being at or about that period
of life.
The Tempe (N.S.W.) Refuge for Women is
rather proud of its oldest charge. When a girl of
16 she was an inmate of the original institution,
and now, at 85, the giddy lady again seeks its
shelter.
Apropos of a recent parsonical debacle,
something always happens to the man who abuses
Ihe Bulletin. That something also always hap-
pens to everybody is likewise a fact, but we ignore
that so as to argue like a parson in this case.
Two N.S.W. Supreme Court Judges
(Messrs. Cohen and Bring), on occasion, wear
hard-hitter hats. But you never saw His Honor
Mr. Justice G. B. Simpson in a hard-hitter hat,
any more than you ever saw him wearing a pipe
in his mOuth in the street.
Levy, M.L.A. for Fitzroy (Sydney), has
won an Australian record. Twenty-two motions
“ that he be no longer heard ” were carried in one
night’s sitting of the Leg. Assembly. He was
thus bowled out for two whole innings in one
night—on a wet wicket, though.
The estate of the deceased Westralian
Premier Leake shows liabilities, £14,714 ; assets,
£16,567; balance, which will probably be swal-
lowed up by realisation expenses, £1853. Once
again, politics don’t pay. A dead politician’s
chief asset is generally his widow.
Apropos President Baker’s wig portrait,
and the S.A. Leg. Council’s desire to have the
horse hair painted out, the portrait of Chief
Justice Dowling, in N.S.W. Supreme Court
building, originally had a wig, which was painted
out, as can be seen on closely scrutinising the
picture.
Interesting for the Adelaide unemployed,
whose promised winter employment was one of
the baits used by the Snow tramway crowd, to
know that all plans have yet to be made, and that,
meanwhile, Mr. Snow, who is represented as
having many private concerns, has set out for the
Harz mountains, in Germany.

Turner will be 51 on Friday, Aug. 8, Rep.
Poynton being 49 on same day.
Mr. Fuller, M.H.R., who was lately bask-
ing in the moonshine of G. H. Reid’s notoriety as
he wobbled around Victoria, was worried at every
meeting by hairy and persistent individuals, who
requested George to “sit down an’ give th’ pup a
show.” Fuller got to be known all over the State
as “ole Gawge Reid’s dry dawg.”
Just as John Haynes was shaping, in
N.S.W., for another go at his ill-starred Capital
Punishment Abolition Bill came the murder of
Constable Guilfoyle. There really ought to be
an Act to prevent John Haynes proposing a Bill
for the abolition of capital punishment, on the
ground that he thereby promotes murders.
A MAN WITH AN EVIL
STAR.
“Some men are awfully unfortunate. You re-
member Smith whose wife died last year?”
“ Yes.” "Well, he’s got married again.”
New York Herald says that King Edward
and Salisbury don’t speak now owing to the
latter’s refusal to recommend Ernest Cassell for a
peerage. Last year a similar request was refused,
but Cassell’s promotion was again demanded by
the King on the ground of his recent munificent
charitable gift for a consumptive hospital.
It was actually cabled to Australia that
J. Chamberlain had sent a cheque for 50 guineas
to the hospital in which he was treated after having
been run down by a pro-Boer cab-horse. This
exhibit is evidently meant as a startling proof of
King Brum.’s munificence, but it reads like the
meanest bit of skite that ever travelled over a tele-
graph wire. What a crawler is the cable-man !
Brunton Stephens’ description (in a letter
to Geo. Essex-Evans) of his method of poetic
production :
I produced another stanza (of “ Convict Once ”) last
night. Sydney Smith hit off my case in describing
Rogers. “ When Rogers is delivered of a couplet he is
kept in bed, and straw is laid on the street, and the
answer to enquirers is that he is doing as well as can be
expected.” That’s me to aT,or to a straw.
Apropos of John Longstaff’s luck in his
commission to paint the King, supplemented by
an order for a portrait of Queen Alexandra. By
the Queen’s expressed wish the Australian was
brought to a Court at Buckingham Palace the
other night, and a week after the event J.L. had
not recovered from the surprise of seeing himself
in a black velvet knickerbocker suit and wearing
a sword.
“ William Lewis” writes :
Dear Bulletin, —You jeer at “Sir” John Jenkins, but
how about Sir Hiram Maxim? To my mind, no more
wildly funny combination has ever been conceived.
What a name for a comic opera ! How it conjures up
recollections of Sam Slick, wooden nutmegs, pork-and-
beans, buck-wheat cakes, and nasal twang 1 Sir Hiram
Maxim, Sir David Harum, Sir John Jenkins ! Shade of
Hosea Biglow ! where shall we find to-day the American
democrat of Lowell’s verse ?
The man arrested at Broken Hill charged
with the big opal mail-robbery is a “ whip ” of
fine busbmanship and unsurpassed know-
ledge of the country. He has been in the
backblocks for years—right back into the
days when the Barrier was the favorite
refuge of the hard-pressed. When the
miner and more or less civilisation came
along he spent most of the years crossing
mobs of moving cattle over the Darling
at Wilcannia. At that risky business he
certainly hadn’t an equal in Australia,
and probably hadn’t one anywhere else.
Mrs. Campbell Praed, in her forthcoming
book of Queensland reminiscences, should be able
to describe some exciting scenes. Her young
married life was spent on Curtis Island, and squat-
ting in those days yielded sensations. She is a
Murray Prior, and her kith and kin are still rooted
there. Her uncle, by marriage—Mackworth
Praed—won the Cambridge prize poem on Aus-
tralia over the head of W. C. Wentworth, of
Sydney.
Dr. Kennion, ex-Bishop of Adelaide and
now Bishop of Bath and Wells, is to be right-hand
supporter of the King as he walks up the aisle of
Westminster Abbey on the day of his Coronation
(Aug. 9). It is difficult to disagree with the
doctors-in-charge at this distance ; but the Aus-
tralian public is inclined to look upon this early
date for the Coronation as an injudicious rushing
of things, and to think that King Ned will need a
deal of support on the day.
In Federal politics George Turner main-
tains his State reputation as a grafter ; the clerks
in his department loudly bewail their boss’s insane
craving for business. Turner’s frugal mind, how-
ever, got quite a jolt when a bill recently came in
for tea-money for the hands he had kept late at
work. In his passion for economy, Treasurer
Turner may yet introduce the “ crib ” system into
his department, and thus make cold, proud, high-
collared civil-servants carry to the office billies and
nose-bags.
A statue inaugurated at Melbourne to
William Clarke ! Who’s he ? Who knows—
without a moment’s reflection, on tagging on the
“Sir W. J. , Bart.” The first statue that
Melbourne requires is to William Clarke ! So be
it. He almost chums with Khartoum Gordon,
another gentleman to whom Melbourne was bluffed
into rushing up a memorial. If you ask a William
Clarkite why the statue goes up, he will of course
reply : “Well, you see, Clarke —the Greatest One
—was so rapidly sinking into oblivion that some-
thing had to be done.” A monument to Higin-
botham would be superfluous.
“We have had Seddon, of Maoriland*
over here,” writes a S’African correspondent
to The Bulletin-
“He came to Vere-
reeniging and ad-
dressed the M.L.
troops. I was not
much impressed. He
is very noisy and
very frothy. The
words, ‘ I seldom
make a mistake’
were used frequently
in his speech. He
went with the flood-
tide in the martial
business, and is reap-
ing his reward. He
talks at the people,
not to them; and
has kindly fixed the future
policy of this country. He freely
offered to terminate the war at
any hour if the authorities chose
to follow his advice. I wish he
could have talked with Botha,
De la Rey, De Wet, and Co.
He is full of modesty. His
oratory ranged from Maoriland
mutton to the unity of the Empire. His style is
most grandiloquent, no matter what his subject
may be. . . . Yet in Johannesburg he was very
well received.”
His Majesty King Thomas Fall-off Brassey
at the Royal Colonial Institute, 11th March, ’O2 :
I have undying' recollections of the Hinchinbrook Pas-
sage, and my visit extended to the extremest point of
Thursday Island. Many of my Victorian subjects were
deeply interested in Queensland properties, and I admired
greatly the spirit of enterprise, &c., &c.
His Majesty possesses something else which is
undying—undying impudence. Memo : Why
spell his name with an “ e ” ?
Justice Pring, latest accession to N.S.W.
Supreme Court, dealing with an appeal by the
Railway Commissioners for a new trial, dropped
softly on his brother Judges with the remark :
Speaking for himself he thought juries were better
qualified to decide matters of this kind than Judges could
possibly be. Juries were, of course, not infallible, and
sometimes made mistakes, but upon the whole, and
especially in cases of this nature, they were more likely
to do justice than a Judge, whose mind to a certain
extent was narrowed by legal technicalities. »
“ THE BLIND SINGER”: A MELBOURNE
STREET SKETCH.
“ I arise from Dreams of Thee.”
Robert Richards, of Riverstone (N.5.W.),«
who died too young (19/7/’O2), was one of the best
and straightest of the meat and horse men in Aus-
tralia. Had he given himself wholly to one thing
or the other he must have gone far. His enter-
prise and practical knowledge, associated with
thorough scientific management, would have
placed the whole home and export business in
meat on a new basis. But he was content with
Riverstone, and didn’t get much beyond plater
business in racing.
A fine stamp of enthusiast died the other
day in Walgett hospital after a tree had fallen
on him —Jack O’Brien, bush-workers’ organiser.
With 255. in his pocket (his own and last 255.)
and a bike and a blanket, he set out two months
before last N.S.W. general election to get into
every little back camp in the vast and droughty
Wentworth electorate in the interests of the
Labor man. He neither hoped for nor received a
Eenny for that labor, or for other of equal value
e had done before.
Charley Warne, a full-blooded aborigine,
died t’other day at Kempsey (N.S.W.), at the
reputed age of “at least 118 years ” ! Half-a-
dozen aborigines, aged “at least” 110 to 125,
have died in the last two years. This mythical
longevity takes rise from the fact that no nigger
is certain of his real age, and from the equally
pertinent circumstance that at 70 or thereabouts
he withers and wrinkles up so remarkably as to
look a centenarian. If the just-departed patri-
arch was anyway near his alleged age, he was a
boy of four when Gov. Phillip put up his first
tent on the shores of Sydney Cove.
A team of veteran Boers would have given
great interest to the competition for the Kolapore
Cup. Grey-headed, coffee-drinking, phlegmatic
marksmen of the old school, that lay at ease behind
cover, and picked off the advancing rooineks,
one at a time. Shooting is a sport in which
excellence-cum-sobriety has a long life. Fergusson,
one of the victorious Australian team at Bisley
last week, was the winner of the Queen's Prize at
Wimbledon 22 years ago. Three other members
of the Eight are old enough to have sons as big as
themselves, and their success suggests that the
picture of the old man Boer and his deadly rifle is
not over-colored.
B. E. Minns’ many friends on this side
will be glad to hear that, though still under con-
stant surgical treatment, the New Englander’s
health is distinctly on the up-grade. “I had an
hour’s chloroform three weeks ago,” he writes in
his latest letter, “and am due lor another soon.
The surgeon is trying to mend the hole he had to
make in my side ; I fancy he’ll make a job of it
in one more go. I hate the idea of an operation,
but am never sick after it, unlike most people. . . .
Am kept busy, notwithstanding that, for nearly
four years now, I have had to be content with
what the editors here choose to send ; however, I
hope to be in a condition to ‘ buzz ’ round more
soon.”
Little Isidor Lissner, who died the other
day, was one of the most genial and popular souls
who ever stepped into the Q. Parliament, Came
to Bendigo in the fifties, migrated to Maoriland,
and finally returned to Australia to help open up
Ch. Towers, in ’73. Returned to Parliament for the
Kennedy, he was finally made MTlwraith’s Minis-
ter for Mines prior to ’93. Labor beat him
in ’93, and though subsequently returned for
Cairns his political mana was gone. Was fond of
dubbing himself “A bad speaker but a good
Lissner.” An old Parliamentary anecdote repre-
sents Lissner- as saying concerning certain kid-
napping outrages, “they vould make your hair
cold and your blood shtand on end.”
The Baronet Clarke statue stands just at
the entrance of Melbourne Treasury gardens.
Poor old S’William’ used to pass through those
gates early on most mornings in the week, making
a bee-line for the Masonic Club and a stiff
whisky-and-soda. From the Club to St. James’
Buildings, thence to the bank ; Australian Club
afterwards and home to Cliveden or Sunbury early
in the afternoon. Nothing about him to suggest
apotheosis or statue-raising. Just kindly and con-
siderate management of inherited wealth and
consumption of as much liquor as could be digested.
A tablet in the bank would have been right
enough, for in the crash of ’93 the baronet took all
the responsibilities of one bank and a big share of
two others on his shoulder without a murmur.
The shoulders were well padded—revenues for
decades averaged over £150,000 a year. Porters
and guards on the Sunbury line say the statue
ought to have been on the station. The Bart, was
a model to all who entered there. “Shaky as he
might be, said old Mac., “his fingers could always
find the road to the right pocket and pick out half
a quid when they got there. A man of that sort
is lit for a station anywhere.”
A look-back at the most shameful time in
the police, history of Australia does not make
ghosts of Dan Kelly and Steve Hart, said still to
be in the flesh. There never was sure evidence
that either of the two was killed. Father Gibney,
of Perth, was the only one game to enter the
house after it had been fired. He saw two bodies,
and by touching ascertained that both were dead.
After the fire the skulls and parts of the trunks
only were found. The armour they had worn was
in the same room, and the supposition was that they
had removed it and shot one another. Ned Kelly
was of opinion that they were not game for that sorb
of thing. And lie himself, as is well known, gob -
out, and could have got clear after the police sur-
rounded the place. His return was about the
toughest instance of matehood in bush history.
There were upwards of 30 people in the house
throughout the “siege.” Three were shot, and
the manner of their shooting is well known, bub
about the death of the two outlaws, if they died,
there has always been silence and mystery. There
was no very accurate tally kept of those who
entered the house the day arid night before.
At a Melb. annual Orange demonstration,
the other day, one speaker high in lodge authority
announced the death of Johnston, M.P. (“Johns-
ton of Ballykilbeg ”) Grand Orange boss in Great
Britain. “Sad news awaits us to-day,” said he ;
“ we have received a cable message announcing
the death of one of the leading members of our
institution—a man whom we have all respected
for years, whose works have endeared him to every
member throughout the world—l refer to” (he
lifted a scrap of paper, tried to puzzle out the
name scribbled on it, and after a lapse of a couple
of seconds said) “I refer to Mr. Johnston—Mr.
Johnston of —er —of ” (another pause and another
scrutiny of the paper) “of Killambeg, Ireland.
Mr. Johnston occupied a seat in the House of
Commons for—er- —more than ” (the paper was
again raised) “for 40 years. It is a great blow
when a gentleman so well-known as Mr. —er —er —
Johnston is tiken from our midst.” Nobody
laughed. Anybody who laughs at an Orange
meeting is at once identified as an emissary of the
Pope.
RARE BIRDS. No. I—(PHIL MAY).
“ Pa ” Pinnock, the stately Q. Sheriff, has
retired to browse on the pension pasturage, and
his place has been taken by a brother of Home
Secretary Foxton. It is laboriously explained
that the latter had nothing to do with the
appointment, and, of course, the public believes it.

The J.P. again. “ Boyang ” writes :
Being delayed, t’other day, in a small N.Q. town, I
strolled into the local court-house and found that a Chow
was being sued for debt and that a lively argument was
proceeding between one of the magistrates and plaintiff’s
lawyer, who objected to the J. P.’s presence on the Bench
on the ground that he was an interested party. Finally
the J.P. unwillingly left the Bench, but promptly took

fendant Chow! Yet those present didn’t appear to see
anything unusual in the occurrence.

11. M. Pibfc gives S.M. Herald interesting
facts about sheep-feeding in the drought. The
work on Burrawang is prob ibly the biggest of the
sort ever attempted. More than 100,000 sheep
are hand-fed at a cost of per week each.
They would about eat their heads off at that rate
in six months. But how would it be if they were
fed on station-made ensilage, instead of hay at
£6 a ton and wheat at 4s. Cd. a bushel ? The
daily consumption now is 23 tons of hay and same*
of wheat. The wheat would be equal to four
times the quantity of hay. For 100,000 sheep, say
400,0001 b. of ensilage a day. On one big A r ic.
farm ensilage has been put down at less than ss. a
ton and more than 10 tons to the acre. A 5000-
acre farm, on that basis, would give a food supply
for 250 days at a cost of <£12,500 (ton reckoned at
20001 b.). This year, taking Mr. Pitt’s figures as
correct, it will cost Burrawang a trifle over
£OO,OOO for six months.

At Gracemere (near Rockhampton) some
hundreds of cows are kept in good milking condi-

At Daandine station (S.Q.) the cattle are formed
into camps of 400 and prickly pear is fed to them
in troughs. There are six tanks to each camp, and
three men employed at the fires. No water

Died recently at Mareeba (N.Q.), Annie
Doyle (better known as “ Red Jack ”) who had
f >r years been well-known in out-back Australia.
Constantly travelling and never stopping long in
one place, there is hardly a far-out township or bad
track in Queensland that she hadn’t visited. As
a rule “Jack ” had a decent horse or two and was
ever eager to make a match. She made one once
at Cloncurry, with a Chinaman, for £10 —one mile
—owners up. The race came off on a Sunday—all
Cloncurry attending. It was a very close thing,
and in the struggle for home “ Jack’s ” hair (red —
wh )nce “Red Jack”) came down; ditto the
Ch nv’s pigtail. The lady won by a bare half-
length. She was a good “bushman,” and would
tackle any sort of work for a spell—her fancy jobs
being droving and cooking. Didn’t drink, but
could awear like a bullocky.

to a cow lying alongside fence, and jumped on to
her. Fence was still too high, so bunny set to

A true yarn of a “tight, place ” comes
from Albury (N.S.W.). A squatter shot at a wild
bull and missed. The bull came over in great
haste to ask the squatter what he meant by it,
and the latter, seeing the case was urgent, got off
his horse, and climbed up a tree. As he did so lie
dropped his gun.. In climbing up the tree his
foot got jammed in the fork of a branch, and lie
was left there. a prisoner. The bull then prodded
the horse which had its bridle ent tngled in a
branch, and finally it stuck its horn through the
bridle and left, taking the horse with it. The
squatter had an impression that he might leave
his bones up the tree, but after a while he got free
and limped after the bull, which he demolished
with a second shot. Next day, by way of cele-
brating his escape, he accidentally cut off two of
his toes with an axe, and as he had just recovered
from an attack of blood-poisoning when he met
the bull, he doesn’t seem, taking things all round,
to be a lucky pastoralist.

“ Traveller” writes from Queensland aboyt
the prospects of that State’s “ great natural in
dustries ” :
This country is in a bad way. The dairymen from
Brisbane to Toowoomba are practically wiped out; rem-
nants of once-numerous herds still lingering on upon
straw-chaff-cum-molasses, prickly-pear and boiled sugar-
cane. If rain does not come within the next two months
there won’t be a beast left in this district, because it will
be impossible to drive them to and fro for water. The
wretched skeletons stand in the same place all day long
waiting to die. A man at Rosewood, who six months ago
had 100 cows, has now but 25,14 having died in one night.
Another, after 22 years’ farming, has now nothing to show
for it but a mortgage ! Cookies who liaoc any hay and
straw are selling at £lO and £4 per ton respectively, and
letting their own cattle take their chance.
From Ipswich to Toowoomba, thence to Pittsworth,
Leyburn, Inglewood to Goondiwindi, the country is
a mere desert of dust, misery and dying cattle.
Horses follow you and whinny pitifully ; one to which I
gave a “ johnny ” followed me for five miles. The trees
are dying, and dead marsupials are everywhere ; the
only thing that appears to flourish being the crow —which
seems to revel in all the horror. Near Goondiwindi I
met a man with 4000 sheep out of 40,000 with which he
had left Deniliquin (N.S.W.). He had sold 3000 en route,
but the other 33,000 had perished 1
Teams are now making for the stations laden with
straw chaff, but without green stuff the cattle must die,
as this kind of tucker forms a ball in the stomach as hard
as iron. With no crops this year an I the cattle all dead,

“Nobaii” : I
had got into camp
and was hobbling
out my horses when
a man came up,
wearing three coats
and two hats, one
over the other.
“Yell, I tink I
camp over dere,” he
said, pointing to a
dead leaning box-
tree. He made a
large fire on the
leaning side of the
tree, boiled his billy
and had a feed.
Then he made a
shakedown of leaves
just where the trunk
of the tree would be
likely to fall, as the
fire burnt through
it. Not wishing to
be delayed on an in-
quest I pointed this
out, and after much
persuasion he shift-
ed over towards
where I was camp-
ed. During the night
the tree fell with a fearful crash. I got up with a
start and found the other chap dancing round the
fire and clapping his hands like a Salvarmy cap-
tain. Then I noticed that the tree had fallen
within a foot of where he had been sleeping,
“You shifted back, after all,” I exclaimed.
“Yes,” he answered. “You tink you get me
over near you und rob me. I sleep vere I like.”
I cleared out as soon as I could catch my horses. I
afterwards heard that the crank was found boiling
his 'billy on the floor of a woolshed. The fire had
not quite eaten through the boards.

If there is one class who should more than
another regret the happening of “tragedies” it
is the man who carries his swag. If one such
shows up in the affected district while the hue-
and-cry is on, he at once becomes the cynosure of
all eyes; weak-minded people rush inside at sight
of him and barricade the doors, while other luna-
tics fly to the telephone and call the police in
frenzied, broken gasps. He is dogged and way-
laid and variously persecuted at every turn; and
while innocently boiling his billy under a gum-
tree he is suddenly surprised by a rush of bobbies,
“laid on” by idiotic residents, who cover him
with guns and roar at him to “bail up.” The
police cause might be materially helped if some
hoodlums could develop enough common sense to
reason that a man is not necessarily a scoundrel
because he carries a swag.

“Ham”: Re a par. (8., 28/6/’O2). I
have known men kill a beast, and after cutting
off the required quantity of beef, effectively hide
the carcase thus : First, the defunct is buried in
the usual way; then a second hole is dug close by,
presumably for prospecting purposes, the dirt
being thrown carelessly over the place of the first
hole, thus giving the locale merely the appearance
of an abandoned alluvial shaft.

At last sitting of Condobolin (N.S.W.)
local Land Board Mr. E. M. Y. Curr, a squatter,
/ties, called by the Crown to give evidence as to the
capital value of certain lands which the Board was
asked to appraise, and on which the applicants
(selectors) thought the Crown placed too high a
value. Mr. Curr founded his estimate on the
basis of having one man and a boy to look after
an area sufficient (in that district) to carry 3000
sheep—about 9000 acres. He even limited the
estimate to two rations, stating that most of the
selectors round him were running their farms by
themselves assisted by a boy at about 10s. per
week. Several well-known graziers afterwards got
together and drew up the following programme of

BUSH ASTRONOMY.
“I can undlherstand, Mo ike, how they measure the distance of thim star-rs,
and weigh them, but what bothers me is how they foind out their names.”
“ M'unga ” : Re “ Burketown citizen’s”
statements (8., 14/6/’O2). An exposure of treat-
ment the aborigines have received and are still
receiving would “stagger humanity”; but no
man really “in the know’’ would dare to show
things up. In ’93, a station-manager in W.Q.
brutally murdered a black because he thought
the man was trying to entice away one of his (the
M.’s) “stud” gins. At the request of an eye-
witness (who could not write), I wrote to the
district inspector of police, giving all particulars.
The inspector, however, merely sent my letter
back to the manager, with the result that I had
to clear out of the neighborhood. As for “Burke-
town Citizen’s ” squatter who boasted of riding
down aboriginal men and outraging the women —
that, in some parts, is quite common. One squatter
in his youth invariably cut the women’s throats
afterwards, and the only thing that this brute
cared for was a dog that acted similarly with
female dingoes. A lovely pair 1

from the time of Kimberley rush. In ’B3 or ’8413
men started overland from W.Q, with a few
horses and very little capital but plenty of what
they called “knocker.” At each station they
struck they demanded rations, and if police had
been plentiful in that part they would never have

Kuppers Elberfelcl Lager.
A Melbourne pressman, during the Royal
visit, went to tlie transport to interview one of
our dusky “fellow-subjects,” who was alleged to
be the crack rider of all India. The scribe asked
a gorgeous be-whiskered nigger on the deck if he
could direct him to Khan Mahomed. “Cer-
tainly,” was the reply; and, while seeking their
man, the suave darkie talked affably to the re-
porter in perfect English, telling him all about
their trip, and the high appreciation they felt for
Australia. Then suddenly he drew the pressman
aside, and said: “Look here; if you are writing
anything about us, I would feel obliged if you
would say that Jumbo Singh is the handsomest
man in the whole procession. I’m Jumbo Singh,
you know ; and I’d like you also to comment par-
ticularly upon my uniform. This is all real gold ;
this embroidery cost 100 rupees, and this scarf is
one of only five of the sort in all India.” “ But,”
ventured the rep., “aren’t the rest dressed like
you ? ” “Not a bit of it,” said the other. “ Their
uniforms are only bad imitations of mine—didn’t
cost a quarter a 3. much ! This belt, now, is a
masterpiece of Indian art ; but don’t forget to say
that it is the sole property of Jemadar Jumbo
Singh. Then just look at these shoes! ”
“But,” interrupted the reporter, “ I must really
get hold of Mahomed Khan.” “What do you
want him for?” asked the other. “Well, I
believe he’s the best rider in the Indian army,”
ventured the newspaper-man. Jumbo Singh
laughed with huge contempt. “Look here,” he
said, “don’t you bother about Mahomed Khan.
He’s not half the rider that I am. True, he has a
following of low-caste coolies who believe in him,
but if you are dealing with the very aristocracy of
horsemanship just you come to me ! Also, if you’re
writing anything about swordsmanship I am the
one you should come to. Not a man in the Indian
army can touch me at that! And, as for shooting
” “But,” protested the scribe, “you see, our
office in its ignorance told me to see Mahomed
Khan, and I’ve got to obey orders.” “Just as
you like,” remarked the darkie loftily. “ But you
tell them, if they put in that stuff about me, I’ll
buy a thousand copies and post them all over
India.” Kipling wasn’t far out with his “half
devil, half child.”

“Come in, old chap ! By Jove, isn’t it cold 1
Shut the door! Thanks, It is cold i I didn’t
believe it could be so cold in Sydney ; can’t get
warm except when I’m at work. Yes, I get plenty
of work in this part. It’s the heaviest part I’ve
ever played in my life, and I’m ‘Facing the
Music,’to the tune of dropping lOlbs. in weight
the past three weeks. Made the mistake the
other day of giving a matinee —to a full house—
Oh, no ! I don’t want to publish figures—but I did
open iny eves when Mayne brought round the
total. But that’s not it. The matinee knocked
me out. After it was over, I crawled home at five
and went to bed until half-past six.
“ How is it that people so closely associate
me with the ‘ Private Secretary ’ and
‘Charley’s Aunt’? T’other day I was stand-
ing in the street with a ladv, and some-
one close by said ‘that’s the Private Sec-re-
tary an’’is bloomin’ lionali ’ '1 he success of my
life was as Mousta, a humpbacked, one-eyed
monster, in W. S. Gilbert’s blank verse tragic
play ‘Broken Hearts.’ But people don’t know
that--they always associate me with the ‘ Private
Secretary.’ Irving lent me a dagger to use
in the part of Mousta, and when I was on, Ellen
Terry herself brought Irving along, saying ‘Gome
and see this little comedian play tragedy.’ After
the performance Irving said to me, ‘ You’ie wasting
your time in comic opera,’ And he asked me to
keep the dagger as a memento.
“The Australian audience is the most critical
and appreciative in the world, and the best
audience I've played to. And it’s a public that
forms its own opinion, and sticks to it. For
instance, ‘The Bookmaker’ received excellent
notices from the Australian press everywhere.
It was practically boomed by newspaper criti-
cisms, but the Australian public didn’t fancy it,
so wild horses wouldn’t draw them into the
til 'atre.
“An actor who is original, and who makes
suggestions to a manager, is a very valuable
acquisition to a company ; and a girl who has
initiative quickly rises in the profession. When I
was young I was as full of zeal as 1 am now ; and
I sometimes made a suggestion to W. S. Gilbert,
although be was apt to resent it. Here is an
instance, from the rehearsal of ‘lolanthe’: ‘I
would like to make a suggestion, sir.’ Gilbert
(savagely) : ‘Aren’t my lines good enough, sir?’
Thornton: ‘Yes, sir; but the line, “the sheet
slips demurely from under me,” is a bit awkward,
sir.’ Gilbeit (overwhelmingly) : ‘Why, sir?’
Thornton : ‘ I have to make a face like this when
I say the sheet shbllips, sir.’ Gilbert : ‘ What
would be better, sir ? ’ Thornton : ‘ The sheet
glides, sir.’ Gilbert (with loud pomposity): ‘My
id rds, if you please, sir I—my wok os ! ’

“ The ‘Private Secretary ’ as originally produced
was a failure. The star part of the piece origin-
ally was Gibson, the tailor, who wants to get into
society, and the piece was guyed and booed on the
first night. But Beerbohm Tree scored so great a
hit with • his creation of the Secretary, that
that part was made the star part and' to-day
we play it with the make-up and mannerisms as
created by Beerbohm Tree.
“Nearly all actors and actresses are content at
rehearsal, to merely speak their lines. I have the
greatest difficulty to get my company to act at
rehearsal. When I’m rehearsing I act—act to the
empty theatre. And after I’ve let myself go, I
sometimes overhear my company in the wings
saying ‘Look at the governor ; how can he do it ;
isn’t he worked up ! ’
“The opera ‘Pinafore’ is another instance of a
frost becoming a great success. It was produced
in the month of May at London Opera Comique,
and was. such a dire failure that the co. agreed to
accept two-thirds salary until the next opera
(‘Pirates of Penzance’) was ready. Shortly the
news came along from America that ‘ Pinafore ’
had caught on there amazingly, that dozens of
co.’s were playing it. With that the English
public awoke to the merits of ‘ Pinafore,’ and con-
sequently the piece ran a year and 11 months to
enormous business. A two years’ run I —yet on
the first night the English crowd jeered and
hooted, and after Josephine's song they yelled,
‘ Oh, take it away ; there’s another shop ballad.’

crying, and so would I. I’d turn to tier and say,
‘ Stop it, Lucia, you fool ! you’re blubbering ; ’
and Lucia would reply, 1 Look at yourself ; you're
tbe fool; iou began it.'
“ A recent instance of a failure being changed
into a success was ‘The Manualvres of Jane’ at
London Hay market. Jones is the author. At
time or first production, the play, ‘WhatHap-
pened to Jones’was running at the Strand. On
first night of ‘Jane' the audience oooed and
hoote 1. Jane,' played as a serious comedy, went
dreadfully flat. The gallery jeered at every turn.
‘Oh, take it away!—what’s happened to Jones.’
Maude, the actor-manager, then hit on the ex-
pedient of broadening Jane out to a tarce, with
the result that a play tnat was dead on trie first
night ran ior over a year.
“ Then tnere was Kitty Grey, a comedy pro-
duced not long ago by George Edwards at the
Vaudeville. Magnificent cast—no go . He turned
it into a musical piece, and ever since ne has been
coining money with it m London and the pro-
vinces.
“One of the very smartest things of the London
stage was done at the Comedy Theatre at a
matinee of one of Charles Hawtrey’s plays. The
audience was much taken by the leading man’s
clever burlesque of Charles Hawtrey’s acting, and
applauded vociferously time after time. At the
close the leading man pul ed of? his make-up, re-
vealing Charles Hawtrey himself laughing at the
bewildered audience. ‘ Ladies and gentlemen, I
am very glad that my imitation of myself has
pleased you so well.’
“Some actors and actresses get very big salaries
in London, but even first-class people get much
smaller salaries than one would expect. One of
the chief reasons is that so many younger sons of
swells are now turning to the stage. They look
well, speak well, and as they get an allowance
from the paternal estate they can afford to play
for next to nothing. Besides that the profession
is so fearfully overdone, although in London they
have a standing population of some six millions
and a constant floating population of a quarter
million —250,000 people always ‘doing London.’
“ Vo, I haven’t seen a doctor about my loss in
weight. For us actors there’s no tonic like the
footlights, no doctor so good as Doctor Theatre.
“I vvill tell you a story of stage superstition.
Mr.D’Oyly Carte and I had a pleasant chat one
day, each of us sitting comfortably ’in an arm-
chair, and while enjoying a good cigar we came to
a very amicable agreement. The agreement was
that I was to stage-manage and produce ‘Princess
Ida ’ for Mr. Carte in America, on terms
which we fixed to our mutual satisfaction. And
we further pleasantly agreed that the contract
should be signed on the morrow, and that I should
take my departure by the morrow’s midnight
train from Euston. Home I went, packed up
trunks, sweated, bustled, worried, grafted, got
ready. Then early next morning, with serene
feelings and a smiling face, I rattled in a cab
down to Mr. Carte’s office. Self-congratulation
rose within me as I reflected that the signing of
the contracts would occupy but ten minutes,
and that then I would have the rest of the
day to spend in the way that I liked best.
The doorkeeper stopped me. ‘ Beg pardon, sir ;
Mr. Carte is very busy now, sir, and cannot see
you.’ For a moment the news knocked me over,
then I knocked thedoor-keeperover, jumped up the
stairs and into D’Oyly Carte’s office. ‘ D’Oyly ! ’
I shouted, ‘what’s the game?’ He looked up
from his desk and said very affably “ There is no
game ; I will meet you at the train and sign the
contract.’ I answered: ‘Rats ! If you’re doing
to sign the contract why not do it notv?’ Rising
with dignity he said very solemnly and collectedly,
‘My dear Thornton, don’t get excited ; I’ll meet
you at the train and sign the contract .’
“At 15 minutes before midnight I arrived at
the railway with my bags, my trunks, my boxes,
my portmanteaux, my hat-boxes, my macintosh,
my great coat, my umbrella, my goloshes, my
orange, my biscuits, my tea-bottle, my milk-
bottle, my cushion, my fur-cap, my warm slip-
pers, my cough-mixture, my wliisky, my cigar-
box, my cook, my valet, my groom, my bootblack,
etc., etc., etc. And damme if there was one
sign of Mr. D’Oyly Carte. I began and kept at it
for ten minutes. As I stopped momentarily to
get breath, [ heard a soft, suave voice purring at
my side : ‘My dear Thornton, don’t swear ; my
wife has come with me to see you off.’
“ ‘Oh, no, D’Oyly : I’m not off ! ’
“‘My dear Thornton, don’t make a scene;
kindly get into the train and I’ll sign the con-
tract.’
“‘My dear D’Oyly, I will get into the train
after you have signed the contract, and it’s now
two minutes to 12.’
“Mrs. Carte got hold of my right arm, Mr.
Carte took mv left, and partly by entreaty and
mostly by shoving they got me into the carriage.
“ The clock began booming the midnight twelve.
“‘Sh-h-h! dear Mr. Thornton,’ purred Mrs.
Carte.
“ ‘ Sh-h-h be blowed,’ I said : ‘look here, D’Oyly,
if that contract’s not signed I’ll get out at Liver-
pool and come back. ” Bang! went the last
stroke of midnight. Shriek went the train
whistle. D’Oyly Carte whipped the contracts out
of his pocket, Mrs. Carte fetched an ink-Dottle
. and pen out of her pocket, . and we were off;
I in trie carriage, D’Oyly Carte and Mrs. Carte
running along the piatform, Mrs. D’Oyly clutch-
ing ner skirts up viitn her left hand, and
keeping stride with ner nusband. So for thirty
yards we sped along, Mrs. Carte holding tne ink
bottle m tier right Hand, D’Oyiy Carte signing the
contract, then scrambling me the pen, I signing
the duplicate. Throwing the duplicate to them I
hung out of the window and shouted, ‘Why the
devil didn’t you fix it up before?’ And D’Oyly
Carte propping at the edge of tue station with red
puffing cheeks, with Ins panting wife beside him
clutching the ink-bottle in her right hand and her
skirts in her left, mapped his hands, one each side
of his mouth, and shot oack the answer through
the distance, above the roar of the train, “BE-
CAUSE I NEV - ER SIGN A CON -
TRACT ON ERI - DAY-Y-Y-Y ! ! ! ’ ”

Thos. L. (Melb.) : No, Thomas, we won’t put
the announcement of your coming matrimonial joy in
this paper. Send it to Melb. Punch. It’s of no interest to
us, or to the world. Happy man are you if it is of
supreme interest even to her J.M.D. : You ask—
Can a woman act a part
When a lover comes to woo ?
Can a duck swim ? Love is the part of life’s drama in
which women have established by skill the right to play
the “lead,” and men are but “supers.”.. ..Sprat : The
• average age at which man marries in Australia is a little
over 2!) and woman 241.... W. J. : Have you ever met the
“clamorous lambs” of your poem? All the lambs we
have known were quiet 1amb5....8.H. : “Old Sweet-
fellow” fails badly. The mild, weak person whose
fatuous grin brings all the hawks round him to clean him
out, and who cleans the hawks out, has been done very
often and very much better Milky W. : “ Mallee
Sketch” lacks the touch of realism... .MacDonald :
Have you any idea of the size of the contract you want
us to undertake ? L. Chetwynd : “ Old Fire Horse ”is
a rather small and rather weak horse-lie. The horse-lie
should be at least 16 hands high, with big hindquarters,
and a perfect devil of a tail.... 11. M. ; We find a corner
for it here—
Hickory, Dickory Dock,
The mouse ran up the clock
Of her S-T-O-ock-I-N-G ;
Oh ! how S-H-O-ock-I-N-G
That a mouse shouldn't know
That the clock doesn’t go
A tick or a tock
On a Dickory-Dock-
ery S-T-O-ock-I-N-G.
E.L. : Both A. andß. are right. The N.S.W. National
Gallery belongs to the people and is under the control of
the Government for the time being E.P.0.: It much
impresses The Bulletin, anyhow, to see the sort of
doctors on whom the A.N.A. is conferring its patronage
as a rule. But the thing is a ghastly tragedy so far as the
poorer and the more ignorant members are concerned .
Give names'? Yes, we could give you several names....
Phil Garlic : A little incident on which you hang such sen-
tences as this : “ Gratitude for such an envious position
on such a sweltering day did not appear to be the pre-
dominant look on the old fellow’s face.” In short he sab
in the shade and didn’t look glad. And what of it, any-
how ? S. (M.): The public isn’t a bit interested in your
bliss. It won’t rejoice when you’re married (unless" you
buy drink for it) any more than it will remove the cigar
from its mouth when your funeral passes by. And tuis
paper does not now publish engagements, especially
relating to weddings which will “ probably occur in
November next.”... .E.W.A. : The gentleman probably
was never there at all. He keeps within the draught-
beer radius V.E. : Who cares about the “flutter”
which is caused in official circles by the stale
yell of a forgotten ex-policeman ? The Vic. police
force is so highly unsatisfactory that only its
newest scandals are worth inquiring into A.L." : Dr.
lientoul, as it happens, has the luck to be Professor ab
Ormond College, for he would assuredly get no pasturage
in the Kurruk. There he would be like Prof. Morris,
turned out of the Melb. C. of E. Grammar School head-
mastership for advocating Liberal ideas gleaned from
Higinbotham, calculated to poison the minds of little
Tallowfats... .E.L.L. : Not so, for in about four years
more the Act passed by Holder (in 1891) providing that
after 15 years South Australian hotels should receive no
compensation for loss of license wall be ojflkative....
James M.T.: No, we don’t want you to write letters to
us when you send MSS. No time to read unnecessary
letters G.M. (M.L.): Not interested in photos, of
Mayors, as Mayors. Mayors, and aldermen in general,
are the most prosaic two-legged objects in all the world.
Awakims : Too slight Boodler : No boodle in it.. ..
Merlin : Pardoned, First Offenders Act N.H.A. : Poem
on Kosciusko is such a very little mound of a poem....
Gerald B. : Try something less ambitious than sonnets,
which, to be at all successful, must have a fairly strong
single thought brought to a lilting climax Purples:
Work shows promise, but “ Swaggie ” not up to mark
W.P.Y. : Doesn’t scan Ottoman : Don’t see much
hope in your verse... .Justice : A copy of “ The Song of
the Shirt”—and not a very good copy... .M.E.F. : Pro-
mising, but not clear enough ; verse needs to be pretty
plain and straightforward, unless there is positive genius
to atone for a troublesome unravelling of the meaning....
Grace H. : Not brightenough MayG. : Tour domestic
verse too tame.... Ernest O. : Verse returned because it
has an unfortunate suggestion that the House of Bliss
mentioned is intended to be the sort of place to which an
all-night cabby knows the way.... R. W. B. : “ Flirtation "
would be worth a par., but no more Mi rani : Subject
anticipated... .Echo : We’ve no fondness for faint echoes
of Sarah Grand Quandong : Phosphorus story unre-
lievedly horrible ILL.N. : Metre too faulty
Die Lorelei: Too thin... .B.C.W.D. : Yes, improved;
but takes too long to come to the point for us. Try
another paper. Cadette : Doesn't sparkle enough
M.L. : Writing decidedly good, but idea improbable and
strongly reminiscent of Wilson Barrett's “ Master and
Man.”.. .Zip.: Carefully done, but over-long for Bulletin.
Have had to severely condense D.: But why so much
journalese ? Look at how it has all been cut—everything
said 10 times more forcibly in a sixth of the space
Anna K. : Will print “ Silver Maiden.” A.E.K. : Why
send sporting items of three months ag0?.... Tomtit:
Appropriately frivolous A. Borigin : Pretty fair
Broker : We’ve no use for tame little lies like that. Men-
dacities should be either monstrous or artistic T.S.A.:
From what we could make out of such a wretched
scribble, the thing has some merit, but is too pietistic for
Bulletin. .. .Chapporal : Good bit of real life, but off
Bulletin’s beat.... A.C.11. : Duly arrived... .Owl-light:
Too long and lean... M. J.M.: To hand —notyet dealt with.
... . A.W.8.: You grievously lack the story-telling gift....
Kuranda : Writing good, but “ plot ” far too obviously
from Drury Lane. Try a more natural subject.. A.C.IL :
We’re not going to approve of the waitress who upset a
pot of hot coffee over her Johnny’s grey suit because he
came in with another girl. She was a Cat....A.S M. :
Has some touches, but too thin... E.A. W. (M.L.) : Thanks.
. ...F.F.J. : No time to answer such silly questions.
Mere fact that you propound queries of the kind shows
that you can’t do anything to suit us, and that you
haven’t enough sense to come in out of the rain.
W.F.H. : No room for anything but well-compressed
matter. You are terribly long and laborious.... Pas-ing
Through: Verses as stale as the Sunday-school bun-
struggle bun... .Korati: One very good item. T’other
doubtful Lukewarm Lover : Trivial. Not a story, nor
even a strong episode.
TO ARTISTIC (AND INARTISTIC) CONTRIBUTORS.
Violet J. : Strong indications of artistic feeling and
grip of character. You should persevere and strengthen
your drawing... .Sigma : One may serve as idea....F.R. :
Only one of the lot even possible.... L.VV.B. : Too weak
for direct reproduction ; one serves as a subject
Mabel S. : All inartistically gruesome ; crow subject
especially played out J. Bres. : Possibly one
P.D.W. : Submitted to artist Gordon F. : Subject for
a character-study ; submitted to artist F.H.B. : True,
you’re not a blessed poet.. S.T. (C. H.): Rather admire
your style. “ Peace ” may do, but you must select better
subjects on the whole Transvaal Sketches (no name on
drawings): Very formal, except the equestrian item, in
which there is some go. There is much promise in you,
provided you get lessons in pen-work from a strong hand.
....P.H. : Phil May could have done that subject vi ry
nicely... .Loz :An obviously 7 unillustratable subject....

A THOROUGH CURE.
Avoca-street, RandwicL, July Ist, 1902.
Messrs. Fisher & Co.
Dear Sirs.—Without any unnecessary words or rigmarole about my case of
rheumatism, I wish to say briefly and earnestly how thankful I am for the
wonderful cure effected by the use of KILLRHEU. For many years I
suffered intense agony from rheumatic pains—sleepless nights, want of appetite,
and general weakness made life a prolonged misery. All kinds of remedies
were tried, including a belt, but no relief came, until I fortunately tried
your KILLRHEU. The result has been marvellous; after taking only one
bottleful every pain and ache has gone. The medicine seemed to reach the
whole system, and effected a thorough cure. I now sleep soundly, my appetite
is excellent, my weight is increasing, and life’s work is a pleasure. I sincerely
thank Pi’ovidence for the transformation. For the sake of other sufferers
from rheumatism, I will only be too happy to reply to letters or confirm by
word of mouth the great cure effected by KILLRHEU.
Yours sincerely,
Witness - George Beach.

POLITICAL
POINTS
erdict of the colonial division of the
Imperial Conference—Better Not.
It looks at present as if the Federal tariff
is going to be put through very easily after all,
despite the yelping of half-a-dozen “ powerful ”
dailies.
They call the Senate’s tariff “requests”
the Dobson-Fraser suggestions, for nearly every
division was carried with the aid of one or other
of t! lose two wobblers.
Action is threatened against certain
M’s.L.A. of N.S.W. who refuse to pay income-
tax. They haye nothing but their Parliamentary
salaries and contend that these are untaxable.
A study in bathos and anti-climax at the
Canada club dinner :
Laurier : Canada can be the Empire’s granary.
Barton : And Australia the Empire’s Butcher.
Seddon : And Maoriland can supply the Empire
with butter and cheese.
While Adelaide has handed over her tram-
way system to a syndicate, Chicago, the second
city of America, has, by an overwhelming vote,
declared in favor of the municipal ownership of
street railways and of gas and electric-lighting
plants.
THE OUTBREAK OF THOMAS.
RAILWAY OFFICERS.
PLATFORM UTTERANCES.—FORCIBLE STATEMENT
BY MR. BENT.
“....was most atrocious. I remarked that if the
man who divulged the figures were in the military forces
he would be shot. As to the speeches, lam not going to
bother over every whelp that likes to talk.”
If T. Bent had his way the above might, in a
slight degree , picture a Minister of Railways'
attitude towards State employees.
Why shouldn't the Australian Common-
wealth, or the States, own a line of passenger and
cargo-steamboats just as they own the railways?
Such ownership would be a safeguard against
such a Morgan invasion as that which bids fair to
cripple England’s oversea-trade.
Queensland democrats have always had
good reason for insisting on an absentee tax, but
never a better one, and never one so easily grasped
by the general intelligence as the present financial
condition of that State. The Queensland ab-
sentee is the white-haired boy of long years of
bad legislation, and it will be a crime if, in the
present whipping of the cat, he is allowed to go
free.
If N.S.W. Advances to Settlers Act be, as
desired, amended to be also an Advances to
Wtrkers’ Act, the redundancy and surplusage of
the title will weigh it down. Why not call the
nnderfaking a State Loan Office, or an Industrial
State Bank ?
Concerning the famous and smellful Sea-
forth estate purchase. It is now a year since the
property—purchased at two or three times its
value by Queensland Government —was thrown
open to purchasers, and not a soul has applied for
an acre of it yet!
The impassioned loyalty of a certain
member of the See (N.S.W.) Ministry in recent
times makes it worthy of notice that just seven
years ago, when the question before N.S.W.
Leg. Assembly was whether Federation should be
under the Crown or under a Republic, that poli-
tician voted for a Republic. Guess his name !
The finest instance of the “geographical
Freetrade” that has been so much in evidence
during the Senate’s consideration of the tariff
occurred on the very last daw, when Gould and
Neild, who pose as absolute Cobdenists, stood up
valiantly for the highly-protected N.S.W. tobacco-
manufacturing industry. The tobacco trade is an
influential one, and politicians have always dealt
tenderly with it. And hereby hangs a tale.
Crouch, M.H.R., asked in the House the
other day whether the Government would arrange
for the popular election of a Governor-General,
under section 2 of the Constitution Act, and the
Reps, roared as if it were the most absurd
paradox. This acceptance of conventions as laws
of God is the sure indication of the truly con-
servative mind, to which even a disease becomes
respectable and desirable if it is of long standing.
Speaker M‘Court t’other day dismissed,
as informal, a petition presented to N.S.W.
Assembly, on the ground that said petition was
typewritten. Parliament, generally the birth-
place of liberal reforms, is conservative to the
point of idiocy on matters affecting its own
fashions and modes of procedure. Witness the
absurd gyrations of Black Rod, the trotting-in at
the right moment of the Mace, and other similar
mummeries.
Why Minister Kingston falls in, is through
his plain, blunt idea that laws were meant to be en-
forced—not to roost for purely ornamental pur-
poses on the dead limb of the statute-book. The
law prohibiting the importation of goods made by
convict labor was approved almost unanimously,
but the first time it was enforced (in Kingston’s
own State and against his own personal friend)
quite a storm fell on his head because he didn’t
withdraw the charge.
The emphatic negative given to the
British-Cabinet proposal that “the colonies”
should provide an English army reserve, shows
how well politicians recognise that the Jingo
sentiment of the last few years is merely a surface
feeling, and that if you scratch even a Melbourne
Mafficker you’ll find an Australian beneath. Only
the blood-drunk Seddon favored the proposal;
Australia, Canada, and S’Africa said “No,” and
it was at once dropped.
Discussing the question of the Common-
wealth entering into some partnership with the
Imperial Govt, as regards the navy, Melb. Akgus
writes
The feeling of attachment and unity is growing on the
side of tiie colonies ; it has progressed wonderfully of late
years. The one thing calculated to chill and damp it
would be the proposal to seal a bond appraising the cash
value of the colonies’ fidelity to the empire.
Just so. Vociferous loyalty is one thing, and
payment in coin is quite another.
Q. Govt., in deference to the mandate of
a number of sky-pilots who have just taken a sham
referendum, has made a modification (per
regulation) in the Education Act to allow clergy-
men to give religious instruction during the first
half-hour of school time. The Q. Education Act
expressly specifies that only secular instruction
shall be given during school hours, and this new
regulation (without any statutory amendment) is,
without doubt, absolutely ultra vires.
Queensland Government seems desirous
of taking special vengeance on Hansakd. One
reporter at £3OO per annum has been dispensed
with ; £5OO per annum is to be taken off the re-
maining seven; and into the bargain a 10 to 15
per cent, reduction all round is yet to come and
then an income tax on the top of it all. Parlia-
mentary reporting (especially in Committee) is to
be much curtailed—to the great joy of certain
Brisbane dailies who ask with charming in-
genuousness—“ Why can’t people be content with
Press reporting of debates?”
Victoria cuts off the sixpence a week rise
formerly granted to its poor six-and-sixpence a
day bobby after two years’ service, but ne’er a
word about reducing the pay of its State Governor,
or extending the. land-tax—which at present only
touches properties over 640 acres in extent and
then is only levied on any value over £2500, so
that all Melbourne is exempt —in order to square
its ledger. Queensland takes 5 per cent, off the
charwoman at the public offices, takes 10 per cent,
off salaries over £lOO, and 15 per cent, off salaries
over £450 —but it exempts the Governor (<£sooo a
year and allowances for looking at half-a-million
people) also the Chief-Justice (£2500 a year) and
the Puisne Judges (£2OOO a year). And not a
word about a land-tax there either ! Australia
fools away nearly three times as much per in-
habitant on its Governors as Britain does on its
royal family and all the royal family relations.
And when hard times come it would rather
retrench the poorest charwoman than touch its
sacred mock royalty.
“HE GIVETH HIS BELOVED PEACE.”
How is India represented in this great
London Imperial Conference ? Three hundred
million ardent loyalists left out, while a represen-
tative of five millions, another of three and three-
quarters, and another of less than one, are settling
the whole hash. Is the entire Empire bent on
securing the prosperity of India, too? What a
noble aim to secure for India that legislation
which is the best for India ! But the representa-
tion in London only consists of two or three
tiddlywinking little potentates, who are absorbed
in eating, drinking, and the ballet. Not a word
about India at the Conference. You see, it is
Bull’s slave region.
King Ned’s invitation-card to a Corona-
tion dinner on sth July, 1902 (reproduced by
several London daily papers), showed, in a
finely-executed design, a sturdy black clasping
hands with a fair white woman. Unconsciously
thus was shown the aim and the weakness of his
Empire. The Black Man and the White Woman
will never unite in amity, for it is against Nature
and her inexorable laws ; when, in spite of Nature,
degraded individuals commit the sin of race-mix-
ture, the punishment is great and follows unto the
fourth generation. But the British Empire—
mostly a nigger Empire—has to either foster that
mixture or face disruption.
It was just about the time that the Corona-
tion fell through that the Boer gave up his alleged
great joy at having become a British subject and
became grumpy and unfriendly again. Edward
VII. was supposed to have had a great deal to do
with the making of peace, and it was only an act
of common kindness to persuade him that he had
made a real peace. He doubtless wanted to be
able to say and to think on Coronation day, that
he reigned over an empire that was not only peace-
ful but cordially friendly. So the ruling powers
in S’Africa, having absolute control over the
cables, supplied a friendly, not to say wildly
enthusiastic, Boer to order. He was a temporary
enthusiastic Boer warranted to last (by cable) till
Coronation day, and he fell through again imme-
diately after that date.
Victoria discovers that £150,000 of its
“ permanent and reproductive ” public debt is
represented only by a squad of worn-out en-
gines slowly oxidising in the sheds at
Newport. If each one had been broken
up when it became worn out the value
would have had to be charged to
working expenses. As working ex.’s
looked bad enough without that, the
ancient wrecks were preserved in a
corner and kept in the balance-sheet as
genuine assets, and they are there yet.
Once more the good old “ permanent and repro-
ductive ! ”
Having kicked the hated Trenwith, and
with him the rest of the Peacock crowd, out of
office, Symes Age was at latest engaged in
shaking the Kyabram incubus oft' its shoulders.
Asa preliminary it jumps on poor old ‘ ‘ Sam ” Lan-
caster, president of that belated gang of political
aspirants, and trie other “bat-eyed Conservatives
of the Citizens' Reform League.” Mr. Lancaster,
the Syme paper remarks, “has no standing as the
leader of public opinion, and any prominence he
now enjoys comes to him purely because of the
movement with which he has the good fortune to
allyshimself.” And the whole Kyabramapootra
agitation was merely run by a lot of male hens of
the Lancaster type, who thought they saw in it an
exceptional opportunity of worming into the good
graces of the mighty David, and thereby getting
a lift into Parliament. Lancaster’s nasty slap in
the eye but presages the general belaboring of
Ben Goddard, John West and co., and it is
tolerably safe to say that when David divides the
sheep from the goats next election time, those
petty schemers will all be among the goats.
A fact to be remembered always in connec-
tion with the question of land-resumption for close
settlement is that, under good management, the
merino will pay just as well as the man, and, as-
the absentee knows, he is not half the trouble.
Ercildoun and Dowling Forest (Vic.), under
respectively the late Salmon Wilson and Bart.
Clarke, showed this. On each estate is at least.
20,000 acres of first-class agricultural land. The
Wilson lot, under sheep, was run by a manager
and about six hands. Clarke had 68 tenant-
farmers, with their families and at least two
hands apiece the year through.
The shabby little faking tha~ has been
done over the N.S.W. State’s Sydney land-
resumptions is a bigger misfortune than it looks.
The political swindle by which all the rents that
the Government could lay its hands on were
treated, and are still being treated, as revenue,
while the corresponding liabilities are charged to ■
loans, will probably, in the end, burden this State
enterprise with half-a-million or perhaps a million
more debt than it should carry. That means
from £15,000 to £40,000 a year more interest,
according to the price paid for the money.
The probable result will be that the en-
terprise, which would otherwise have
paid handsomely, will show a loss, and
State - socialism will get a huge set-
back. The principle is good, but the
paltry crookedness of a Ministry whose
political systems of the three-card-trick
order would bring the best principle
into contempt. The Labor party could
have made the Ministry go straight, but
it didn’t; and there is no permanent suc-
cess for a party which won’t lift a finger
to prevent its own best ideas being thus dragged
in the gutter.
Sydney Telegraph weeps over the pro-
posed North Shore bridge : —
The Government knows all about the need for the
bridge ; no question as to the merits of the case will be
raised ; estimates of cost have been secured. But where
is the money to come from ? If that question could be
satisfactorily answered the bridge would soon become a-
fact.
Exactly. In a poor, small, commonplace spot
like England, cities just put up bridges and pay for
them out of the rates. A special rate of 2s. Or 2s. 6d.
in the £ levied on Greater Sydney for two years
would pay for the whole structure, and even while
the payment was going on the rates would be
lower than in any big English city, and less than
half what they amount to in some cities. And
the Telegkaph, which is so much excited about
following the English example in tariff matters,
never even sees a glimmer of this simple explana-
tion. True to its good old gospel of cowardice and
helplessness, it can only suggest sitting down and
wondering where to borrow the “splosh.”
Attorney-General Wise (who seems to be
the only N.S.W. Minister with any idea of reform
legislation) has personally drafted a new
State Children Amending Bill. At present in
N.S.W. mites of tender years are haled before the
beak, perhaps together with a miscellaneous lot of
drunks and vags. Three separate Ministerial
Departments manage the several institutions, run
by Govt, for their reception, and often, a child is
committed to the wrong sort of institution for its
particular case. Mr. Wise is going to create a.
board (or enlarge the powers of the present State
Children’s Board) to have the power of committing
a child direct to a place of safety or correction
without facing the ordeal of a police-court trial.
This is the most important point of the new Bill,
which deals with a class disquietingly on the in-
crease. * There is nothing novel about the humane-
scheme. Mostly, it is “lifted” from the S.A.
Act. Its realisation, however, looked hopeless
until Wise interested himself in it.. N.S.W.
politicians generally look for something more
showy than simply useful legislation.
“ Del ” : Demagogues are the tubercles of
democracies. Whether they be leather-sellers or
news-sellers it is our Cleons of whom it behoves-
us to beware. Though Athens graved Form from
Chaos, her demagogues dragged her to the
dust (for it paid them) and Greater
Greece with her. The daily news-
paper, by turns unscrupulous
in its own interests, and
flattering the people
through their pas-
sions, is the real
Cleon, the dema-
gogue of our
democracies.
QUIXOTE-SANCHO.
Steyn recalls Stein, the German patriot.
When Bonaparte crushed Prussia, at Jena, he
reduced the Prussian army to 40,000 men. Stein
invented the scheme by which this number of
men was trained afresh every year. Thus Napo-
leon laid the foundation of Germany’s military
greatness.

END OF THE “ DAILY MAIL” OFFER
The Daily Mail (London) announces in our
columns to-day the final withdrawal of its
“Encyclopaedia Britannica” offer in New South
Wales. This sale was undertaken a few weeks
ago by permission of the London Times, and the
period of the contract having been reached, no
further books can be sold after to-day.
We understand the sale has been most
successful, exceeding that even of the Times
distribution of the same work two years ago. A
novel feature of this new offer is an extra volume
compiled especially for the use of students and
others, and entitled “A Handbook of Systematic
Readings in the ‘Encyclopaedia Britannica.’”
This volume forms a 26th and is sent gratis with
all orders for the “Encyclopaedia.” Much com-
ment has been caused by the characteristic manner
in which this offer of the “Encyclopaedia Britan-
nica” has been placed before the New South Wales
public. This no doubt accounts for its marked
success. To-day is the very last day. See
announcement elsewhere.

VITADATIO
HAS CURED HIM OF
Cancer in the Tongue.
To MR. PALMER—
I, Frederick Parks, of California Gully, near Bendigo,
in the State of Victoria, do solemnly and sincerely declare
that this is my Testimonial to you on behalf of mv cure.
I have been a sufferer with Cancer in the mouth for the
past six years. I went to the hospital, and the first thing
they did was to take the tongue right out. In two
months’ time, after the operation, the Cancer grew again ;
it got larger than before. The doctors said that nothing
could be done, so I went home and was put to bed. I
asked my wife to get me a bottle of VITADATIO. I took
half a bottle that night, and in three days I was able to
take oatmeal and sago, and have had no other medicine
but VITADATIO within my mouth. I can solemnly
declare that the world does not know the power of
VITADATIO. lam the the only one living 6Ut of forty-
five cases of Cancer treated last year, and can solemnly
swear that only for VITADATIO I would not be here now,
so I think you can guarantee a cure for Cancer, as mine
was a very bad case ; there being no hope, the doctors
said, and now I can take any kind of food the same as
before the operation. And I make this solemn declara-
tion, conscientiously believing the same to be true, and by
virtue of an Act of Parliament of Victoria rendering
persons making a false declaration punishable for wilful
and corrupt perjury.
F. PARKS.
Declared before me, at Bendigo, in the State aforesaid,
this 14th day of May, in the year of our Lord one
thousand nine hundred and one.

Electricity is the life of the body, and when your system has very little electricity, it certainly cannot
respond to the demands made upon it. Restore the electrical energy, and you restore your vigor. The only
way to do this is to pump a constant vitalising stream of electricity into the weakened human storage batteries
until they are able to again show their'force, and take up their work. To do this, you must have an appliance
that will carry a continuous and powerful current of this unseen force into your body for several hours at a
time. Dr. McLaughlin’s Electric Belt is the only appliance to be had which possesses these important require-
ments. After your family physician gives you up, it cures LAME BACK, INDIGESTION, RHEUMATISM,
DYSPEPSIA, ANiEMIA, VARICOSE VEINS, assists Rupture, and restores the body to its full and normal
vigor. It is endorsed by thousands.
Could Not Walk.
The Dr. McLaughlin Co., Jamison Town,
Dear Sirs : June 6th, 1902.
I cannot speak too highly of your Electric Belt. For
17 years I have suffered from Lame Back and Legs, caused
by "carrying a heavy weight. For the last 10 years I have
been almost a cripple. I have been under several medical
men during the time, but never received any lasting
benefit from their treatment.
A few weeks ago I saw your advertisement in the Daily
Telegraph about your Electric Belts. I came to Sydney
and purchased one, and the result from wearing it four
hours a day is marvellous. I can now stoop and touch’
my boots and feet with my left hand, a feat I have not’
been able to perform for the last 10 years.
My neighbors are astonished at the great improvement
in my health. Some of them want to know what I have-
done with my walking-stick. I can attribute this great
improvement in myself to nothing else but your Electric
Belt.
You may use this testimonial as you please for the:
benefit of all sufferers.—Gratefully yours,
CHARLES SHEPHERD.
Was Unable to Work.
Galston,
The Dr. McLaughlin Go. June 19, ’O2.
Dear Sira, —
I see by the Daily Telegraph that people seem to think
you pay for testimonials, and I, for one, having been a
sufferer, feel it my duty to resent this.
I am 58 years of age, and, about two years ago, received
a fall on to my shoulders, that gave me a very bad hurt;
and, again, I got hurt about nine months ago.
I frequently used porous plasters and linaments, which
I rubbed on the afflicted parts, without receiving any
benefit, and could hardly breathe on account of pain.
It is now about four months since I got your Belt, and
it has done me a wonderful lot of good. lam now able
to work —a thing I could not do before I got the Belt.
You are at liberty to use this letter in any way you see
fit, and I shall be pleased to give all information I can to
any seeking after health.—Yours gratefully,
W. RAWLINGS.
Other so-called Electric Belts had tailed me en-
tirely ; but your Electric Belt Cured me of my lame
back, which had troubled me for years. One week’s
wear seemed sufficient, as I have no further pain.—
A. J. GREENLAND, J.P., “Launchley," Uralla,
N.S.W.
One of your high-grade Belts made a new man of
my husband. For years his liver troubled him, and he
was weak and run down. Now he takes delight in
telling his friends what you did for him, and don’t
seem to ever get tired of praising your appliance.—
Mrs. HARRIET POTTS, Hodson-street, Hurstville,
N.S.W.
£25 Reward
For Proof that
we ever

Bought Testi-
monial.
I am 72 years old, and always arose tired and
languid in the mornings, and with a bad back. After
wearing your belt for about four hours a day for a
few weeks, I feel a .young man again, and as hearty
and well in every respect.—JNO. DIXON, Bened-
meer, N.S.W., 31/3/’O2.
Your Belt is worth its weight in gold. For years I
suffered a living death from Sciatica, but a few short
months of your electric treatment cured me, and put
me right again. It gives me pleasure to recommend
your Belt to both my friends and strangers.—Yours
gratefully,
WM. OGLESBY, Kegworth-street, Leichhardt.
Worn while you sleep, our Belt pumps, a Constant, Soothing Current of Electricity into your body for
hours at a time. No burning or blistering of the skin, because the metal discs are covered with the proper
Electrodes, and the current is under perfect control by means of the regulator attachment, which permits any
desired strength of current being used. Electricity alone is the proper remedy for all organic or functional
weaknesses, arising from improper circulation and unnecessary waste of energy—absolutely restores your vigor.
FREE BOOK—FREE TEST—FREE ADVICE.
If you are suffering from any*ff the ailments we are able to cure, come in and convince yourself that the
BELT is all we claim it to be. We will be glad to explain every detail of our treatment. Don’t imagine you
have to buy because you come for an examination. You don’t. Nor you don’t have to pay a consultation fee,
either.
To the men or women who 'want to regain their health, who want to feel like they did before misfortune
overtook them, we offer one of our Books, which will show the road to happiness. They are brimful of the
things you will like to read, which will give you courage and enlighten you as to the causes and cure of your
troubles. They will point out the pitfalls, and guide you safely to a future of strength and happiness. They
are beautifully illustrated, andtell whait others have suffered, and how they have cured themselves. They are
free, and will be sent, closely, sealed, without ma'rks. If you are not as well as you ought to be, send for one
to-day.


Out of Plumb,
li
x
When the wall is out of
plumb the building is more
or less unsafe, and the more
the wall is out of the per-
pendicular the greater the
danger of collapse. It's
about so with the health ;
it is out of plum when
the digestion is impaired,
when there is the dull, lan-
guid feeling, nervousness,
irritability and sleepless-
ness. Every day that
these symptoms are
neglected they increase
the liability to physical
collapse. We have re-
ceived the following letter
from Mr. Richard Murray, of Green’s-road,
Sydney (well known among financial men in
Sydney), which speaks for itself: —“I have
much pleasure in letting you know the benefit I
have received in taking Dr. Morse’s Indian
Root Pills. I suffered many years with indi-
gestion and biliousness to such an extent that I
found life unbearable, having consulted doctors
in every State; I was at last induced to try
your remedy, and I can faithfully and truly say
that I have found them a lasting benefit, and can
conscientiously recommend them to anyone
suffering from bilious attacks. I never travel
without them, and would advise everyone to do
the same. You can use this letter in any way
you think fit, as I consider it my duty to let
people know the efficacy of Dr. Morse’s Indian
Root Pills.” Dr. Morse’s Indian Root Pills
cure diseases of the stomach and other organs
of digestion and nutrition. They purify the
blood, and cure nervousness, irritability, and
sleeplessness, by curing the diseases in which
they originate, and are a positive cure for
biliousness, indigestion, constipation, head-
aches, sallow complexion, liver and kidney
troubles, piles pimples and blotches, and for
female ailments. Put up in amber bottles, and
the full name blown thereon.
THE AUSTRALIAN GEM TRADE.
H. Newman, the well-known jeweller of 175
Elizabeth-st., Melbourne, is the largest buyer of
Opals, Sapphires, Pearls and other Australian
gems, and consignors will find it to their advantage
to send their parcels direc tto him. The firm has
a reputation for straight-dealing, extending over a
period of 40 years, which is a sufficient guarantee
that they will be honorably treated. A trial par-
cel, which will be followed by direct remittance,
is solicited.

A resourceful railway official has just been
brought to light in Victoria. Through'the negli-
gence of a subordinate at a suburban station, this
masterful individual missed his last train home.
He did not adopt the miserable subterfuge
of other people who were “had” in the
same way, and either walk or take a cab,
but instead telephoned to the depht for a
special engine, which conveyed him home at an
excellent speed and in great majesty. Of course,
the mere annoyance thus caused to the engine-
driver and his yawning assistant, prevented from
getting away to their homes, didn’t matter in the
slightest. When found out, this ready-witted
station-master pleaded that he utilised the engine
as a common home-going passenger who had been
led astray by the default of a railway servant.
But the departmental chiefs decided that as he
was only a passenger at the time he should not
have appealed to himself as station-master for
redress, but should have gone round to his own
night-porter and laid his case before that tem-
porary despot. The comic opera hero, therefore,
had to pay for his engine-ride some of £2 10s.

SPORTING NOTIONS.
Rawdon looks to have a considerable bit the
ou-r er ,° f . the wei e:hts with stable-companion Colonel
Shilmsk l in the Caulfield G. N. Hurdle Race. He beat
the Colonel by a head at Flemington, and is now pitted
against his imposing rival with another 21bs. in his favor.
Again, the fact that both horses will be so much more
Heavily burdened than before should tell in favor of the
one that is least “crushed” and has proved himself quite
’ l\ I t ? ot , B “P erior > to the other in stamina and pluck.
Still, Shilinski would look as well-handicapped as any-
thing in the crowd if Rawdon’s name were missing,
uiven good health and a safe issue out of all their jump-
ing practice up to the day (August 2) the pick of the two
cracks frpm the Miller stable will be a tempting first
favorite for the Hurdle Race. Meanwhile, this scribe
prefers Rawdon’s chance.

Kiota, the own brother to Daimio, has got 9.8
only for the G.N. Steeple, at Caulfield, run on the 9th.
this is 21b. less than he carried over the Flemington
sticks without making a mistake, and, if the promising
young beginner can put on the necessary “ condition ”
between the two events, he must have a good chance.
Two of the horses that fell at Flemington promise to be
more dangerous over the longer distance and easier jumps
at Caulfield. Royal Mail, stable mate of Kiota, is under-
stood to be none the worse for his unlucky topple ; like-
wise Mystery, an old battler that has more than ordinary
speed, and was capable of beating Royal Mail over the
V.R.G. steeplechase course, a few months ago.

The balance-sheet of the Adelaide Racing Club
shows that, for seven days racing in the year, it gave
£7425 in stakes. And, in connection with those occasions,
it received in tote commissions (7£ per cent.), £6332 ;
about £l5O more than the nomination and acceptance
fees, gate-money, catering, race-cards, &c., all put
together 1 The membership is 456, at two guineas.

f Destroying of Q. nag Monseigneur at Ipswich
t’other day, consequent upon an accident, brings to mind
that his owner, Mr. J. M'Qill, of Blacklands, has had
much more than a fair share of ill-luck lately. Bucolic,
Notre Dame and North Australian were previous losses
this season, then promising colt Buckmaster went amiss
when most wanted, and, topping it all, many valuable
brood mare 3 perished through the drought.
* * * *
M.L. winning sires’ list this season is topped by
St. Leger, whose progeny have appropriated £ll,OOO, and
Mr. Stead occupies his usual place as leader of M.L. win-
ning owners with (up to last reckoning) £12,325.
New Australian racing season begins Friday
this week. Winning owners’ list for closing year is
headed by Mr. L. McDonald with £12,322, principally
through Wakeful and Revenue’s appropriations of Mel-
bourne and Sydney Cups and Newmarket Handicap, etc.
Mr. “ J. Baron” finished second with £4223—a big fall—
and Mr. Agar Wynne (£4112) third. Trenton and Gozo
are easily ahead of all other successful sires. ’Tis nine
years since any Australian owner scored as remuneratively
as Mr. McDonald ; in 1892-3 Mr. J. B. Clark’s nags brought
him £13,421. M.L.’s biggest winner (Mr. G. C. Stead)
handled £3 more than Mr. McDonald.
• • * •
V.R.O. balance-sheet is interesting. Stakes
distributed reached £48,904, as against £44,094 for pre-
vious year, and added money was £37,295 —nearly £5OOO
over that for preceding 12 months. Biggest rise was on
Spring meet, when receipts exceeded disbursements by
£9186. Far the greatest loss occurred in connection with
Autumn gathering, which depleted the bank account to
the extent of £3601. Year’s total profits were £10,138,
and losses £3905, leaving a net gain of £6228. All liabili-
ties paid, including £lO,OOO for improvements to the
club’s property in Bourke-st., Melbourne, Y.R.C.’s credit
is now £15,000.

Mr. T. H. Smith, M.L.C., who died in Sydney
Sunday night, was among N.S.W.’s oldest racehorse
breeders and owners. Captivator, Anteros, Clayton
(especially imported) were his most successful sires.
His nags operated principally in the Clarence and
Richmond River districts, where he resided, but many of
them succeeded at Metropolitan meetings. Alderman,
Prince Edward, Prince Consort and Princess Arena were
among the best. The dead man was one of the pioneer
settlers of the Clarence, and had been identified with
pastoral interests there for upwards of 50 years.

Fourth test—England v. Australia—began
Thursday and ended Saturday last, and was a most
remarkable match. Though it rained overnight and in
early morning, weather was fine when play opened before
17,000 people. Win of toss gave visitors a big pull, as at
the outset wicket was slow and easy, but became caked
subsequently. First partnership (Trumper and Duff)
yielded 173 before Trumper was bowled by Rhodes with
104 to his credit, accumulated in exactly lhr. 50mins.,
during which the pair hit up 168. Trumper’s score
included 14 fours, 3 threes, and 6 twos. Third wicket fell
at 179, and the fourth at 183. Hill and Darling kept
going till (when 256 had been notched) former was
caught; his contribution totalled 65, made up of 5 fours,
3 threes, and 6 twos. This combination had added 73.
Seven were down for 288. Darling was next out (caught
off a skyer). Hi 3 51 were put together in 95 minutes,
and included two sixes (both off Rhodes), and 5 fours.
The rest failed badly—seven of them only aggregated 17—
and the full total stood at 299. At the close of that day’s
play five Britishers were out for 70, of which Abel,
Palairet, Maclaren, and Ranji contributed no more than
15. Next morning Jackson and Braund put a widely-
different complexion on things by bringing the figures
to 185—a partnership of 141 for the sixth wicket,
which is one run less than the record. When the tenth
fell the English team’s total was only 37 to the bad.
Australia’s second time at the wickets saw the trio
(Trumper, Duff and Hill) who, among them, had totted
up 223 in the first innings, all out for 7, while six others
could do no better than 15. Gregory and Darling made
61 of the 86 scored by the whole side. With 124 to win
England had 2 out for 68 and 4 for 89. At one stage 16
were required and 5 wickets still remained to fall, but
Trumble and Saunders got them all in quick succession
for 13, thus leaving Australia successful by 3 runs.
Several hours rain the night before and some during the
Englishmen’s second innings played havoc with the pitch,
hence the collapse. The luck towards the end was all
with Australia ; any mistake by batsmen brought about
their discomfiture for a certainty. In England’s opening
innings Trumble bowled 4 for 75, Saunders 3 for 104 and
Noble 2 for 47. Trumble and Saunders had the honors
between them the second time, for the former sent 6 back
for 53 and the latter 4 for 52.
• * * *
Triumph of Australia over England by 3 runs
in fourth test is the narrowest margin recorded for these
contests. Nearest was Australia’s 6 runs’ success against
Shaw and Shrewsbury’s combination, at Sydney Cricket
Ground, in Feb., ’B5 ; and next was at ’Ome, on the Oval,
when, in ’B2, Australia came out best by 7. The “rub ”
of present tour comes Australiawards. Four of the. five
tests have been played—two were drawn and two won by
the visitors; the result of the fifth, therefore, cannot
affect the position.
•* * * *
Up to moment of writing, Australians have
played 24 matches in England, of which they won 14,
lost 1, and 9 were drawn. Prior to the latest (fourth
test), Trumper was much in front of batting figures, with
29 innings for 1319 runs, averaging 45"48. Duff and
Hill were closely bracketed, the former having 33
innings (5 times n.o.)for 998, averaging 35'64, and the
latter 28 innings (1 n. 0.) for 934, averaging 34'59. Arm-
strong’s 8 n.o. innings kept him in fourth position, while
Gregory, Hopkins, and Darling, with larger aggregates,
were within three runs of the Melbourneite. Hopkins’
and Darling’s total compilations were 636 and 635, and
averages 25'44 and 25'40 respectively. Duff topped the
bowling averages (accidentally) with lwkt. for 0 runs.
Trumble is really the leader, his record being 39 wickets,
390 runs, averaging 10’CO. Saunders, Armstrong, Noble,
and Howell followed as named, with little between them.
Bowling feats of Australian Saunders and
Englishman Rhodes, last week, were'food for talk among
cricketing folk. Saunders’ 6 for 9 on third day of the
Surrey match—the last four of which were gathered in
without a run being scored—brings to mind Yorkshire-
man Jackson’s performance in opposition to Australia,
early this season, when he also accounted for four with-
out having a run scored against him. Right through the
Surrey match nine wickets fell to Saunders for 91.
Operating for Yorkshire v. Gloucestershire, top-notcher
Rhodes got 5 for 22 in one innings and 7 for 36 in the
other—actually 12 for 58 ; less than five per wicket.
• • * •
Latest test saw Clem Hill the first (Australian
or Englishman) to aggregate 1500 for those fixtures.
When the match began, Maclaren only wanted five to
achieve that honor, but Trumble bowled him for one,
while Hill scored 65. Maclaren’s 35 in a second attempt,
however, put him 31 beyond the required figures, which
Hill exceeded by 16. Ranji., with 1489 opposite his name
now, should be the next to gain the honor. Trumble’s
105 wickets to date equals the records of Gillen, Peel and
Turner.
• • • •
First innings of test match introduced Trumper
as a record-holder, as his 104 notched on that occasion
makes the sixth century credited to him during the
present tour, and consequently one more than the
previous best (Darling’s) created three years ago.
Trumper’s five other hundreds were—lol against Notts,
121 against Oxford ’Varsity, 105 against M.C.O. and
Ground, 128 against Cambridge, and 113 against an
English Eleven.
v * * *
His 65 runs in the first innings of the fourth
test just completed the even 1000 for Clem Hill for the
tour. R. A. Duff beat him for the four figures by about
one hour. Darling, the next man, was over 300 behind the
1000, Trumper 300 and more ahead.
* * * *
“Sprat”: In giving results of cricket matches
in which first innings has been closed (as Australian
match against Gloucester) why not credit the victors
with the actual win: “16 wickets, and so many runs," in-
stead of “ One innings and so many runs ”?
• * • *
Cable seems to delight in sending details of
English bowling feats (against English batting) by way
of glorifying the Australian batsmen, for they almost
invariably make light of Lockwood, Rhodes, Hirst, and
co., on a decent wicket. If these men have “great days"
how is it that they never do remarkable things, without the
assistance of rain, in a test-match ? Tom Richardson, of
yore, was the last English bowler who could be trusted to
“ come off ” against the Australians every time, and that
was 10 years ago.
* * • •
Australia-Surrey match, finished Wednesday
last week and hampered much by rain, resulted in a draw.
Surrey batted first, getting 296, with Abel (104), Brock-
well (39) and Hayes (37) top scorers. Howell bagged 5 for
80, and Saunders 3 for 82. Second effort brought 111,
Hayward contributing 48 and Hayes 22. This time
Saunders was sensational, bowling 6 for 9, with Armstrong
next best—2 for 34. Initial essay of Australians produced
313. Scores were topped by Hill (90) and Trumper (85).
Next best was Duff’s 57. Second innings saw 1 (Howell)
out for 11 when play ceased.

Both parents of crack bowler W. P. Howell
(with the Australian team in England) died at Penrith

The onljr amateur cricketer who ever came to
Australia with an England eleven at his own expense,
and didn’t draw a sixpence for his trouble, was, as it hap-
pened, the most consistently useful man in the team.
That was Phillipson, a wealthy Northumberland sport,
who did nearly all the wicket-keeping for Stoddart’s first
XI. and helped them to win the rubber in the tests. They
didn’t expect to want the attached amateur in the big
games. A man named Gay was engaged—as an amateur
with “ exes ” paid—for the position of boss wicket-keeper,
but Gay proved a failure from the start, and Phillipson
came to the rescue. Put in real good work behind the
sticks and made a few runs, when they were most wanted,
in a rough, confident style.
* * • «
That Australasian premier sprint swimmer,
Fred. Lane, at Manchester (Eng.) won the British
(actually the world’s) 100yds. supremacy in 60sec. was
news indeed. Prior world’s best figures were Derbyshire’s
(against time), accomplished in '9B, and Lane’s (Austral-
asian supremacy at Wanganui, M.L., in Feb. last) 1.0 1-5.
Of these only the last given had recognition through
t’other performance not being achieved in a race. For
many years the world’s swimmers have been aiming at
what Lane has done, but most of them, as well as swim-
ming writers in different parts—particularly on the oppo-
site side—voted it an impossibility without artificial aid.
Other Australian, Dick Cavill, was second by the touch
only, which means that, so desperate was the struggle,
their bodies might have been level at the finish, but the
quickest to shoot his arm out and touch the end of the
basin got the verdict. Cavill, too, was probably inside
the previous world’s figures. Derbyshire (holder of the
title and the record for several years) finished third.
Race was contested in the Englishman’s native city, and,
as latest mailed advices indicated that he was swimmim'
up to his top form, the merit of Lane’s and Cavill’s feat is
much enhanced.
* * * *
Contention that published statements attribut-
ing defeat of Australian swimmers in the Half-mile,
500 yards, and Long-distance Championships of
England to climate conditions were so much
bunkum is further borne out by Lane’s latest
feat (100yds. in 60sec.), and Cavill’s almost dead-
heat, second. As was demonstrated in the 500yds., so it
is with the 100yds., neither ever swam as well in Aus-
tralia. Another big thing of the English swimming year
(the 220yds.) has yet to be decided, and, provided all
three line up fit, Cavill, Lane, and Derbyshire should
supply an Olympian contest never to be forgotten, and
on the 100yds. form they ought to finish as named.

The brilliant win by the Australian Rifle Team
in carrying off the coveted Kolapore Cup with a record
score must be gall and wormwood to some gentlemen of
the N.S.W. Rifle Association. Those persons contracted
a severe attack of “feelings” because of some alleged
base action on the part of Victoria or Tasmania. In con-
sequence, the N.S.W. reps, in the team were withdrawn.
However, the rest of the Commonwealth rifle shooters
“ bucked up,” sent their men, and have won the Cup.
* * • *
Imperial challenge trophy, Kolapore Cup, the
big thing of international teams’ rifle-shooting, fell to
Australia last week with a record score of 770. Previous
best was mother-country’s 768, in ’99, which averaged 96
per man ; and this the Australians, at practice three
weeks before, tied. English team got away with the
prize last year, having an aggregate of 759, and amono-
them was the highest individual scorer in the competi-
tion. Canadian reps, were second, making 751 ; their
last win was in ’96. Britain has succeeded 23 times since
the Cup was given by the late Rajah of Kolapore, in ’7l.
A Victorian team annexed it in, the Diamond Jubilee
year, and Guernsey on the following occasion. In the
connection it’s worth mentioning that five of this year’s
victorious eight—all Victorians—previously lined up for
the same competition as members of the ’97 and ’9B Vic-
torian combinations. The first lot won with an aggregate
of 75, and the next team was only beaten by three points
—Guernsey scoring 744 to the colonials’ 741.

Australian rifle shots, J. T. Lake (S.A.) and
Private Ballinger (M.L.) made the “ possible ” at 200 yards
in the King’s match at Bisley (Eng.) t’other day Con-
ditions are 7 shots each at 200, 500, and 600 yards • and
seven consecutive bulls eyes at a 7in. bull is no small
-achievement. Also announced that Victorian crack W.
Sloane finished 16th in Coronation, match with 99 points!
Possible was 105. Sloane’s aggregate is therefore a very
high one and, to fill 16th place among perhaps something
over 1000 competitors, is an excellent performance.
“ Graphic ” match saw M.L. fore-front shot, Mr. Wmslade,
get the “ possible ” (35) and, in shooting off with other
notchers of “ possibles ” he qualified for 15th prize.

World’s pug supremacy wa3 contested in ’Frisco
Friday last week, when ’Murkan ex-boiler-maker Jeffries
went through old-man Maorilander, Bob Fitzsimmons, in
eight rounds. Nothing else could be expected, consider-
ing the way the match was made and the manner in
which freckled-fisted Fitz. conceded everything to the
hairy Yankee. As the Maorilander crossed the continent
to fix things, it was plainly a case of “ needs must.” Also
difference in age was much against Fitz., who is in the
40’s, while Jeffries hasn’t got through the 20’s. It’s any
odds that the fighters share a big “ gate ” and money paid
for cinematograph-picture rights, &c. Previous battle
between this pair, indicated Fitz.’s downfall, as Fitz. has
always had to make his own fight, which might be all right
with men of Jem Corbett’s stamp, but with a steam-hammer
like Jeffries it is entirely different. Peter Jackson used
to assert that if ever Fitz. and Jeffries met again, the
latter would surely win. The dead black classed Jeffries
among the best heavyweights the world has seen.

First genuine contest for Australasian light-
weight bruising supremacy will occur in Sydney four
weeks hence, between champion Jack M'Gowan and
“ Rollo.” A few months ago latter wasn’t considered
among Sydney’s third-raters, but someone gave him a
chance of a match with Mat Mitchie by posting money
and providing the wherewithal for training. The Mitchie
party, cocksure of success, went down badly, for Rollo
won all the way. rle is sturdy, steady-going, fights hard
and takes punishment as if ’twere food to him ; and is
remarkably quick with his head. Melbourne’s curly-
haired miniature giant will need all the stoush he can
gather to settle “ Rollo.”
• • * •
Wail about pugilism being dead in Melbourne
was not borne out by results of the Doherty-Felix crash
for Australian supremacy. The “gate” totalled some-
thing in the neighborhood of £l3OO, bringing big profit
to the enterprising individual who hung up the £l5O
purse and probably paid another like sum for rent and
fitting generally. Last week Armidale maintenance man,
Billy M’Coll (now a full-blown dispenser of grog at New-
castle) and champion Bill Doherty were matched to fight
in the old Sydney Exhibition Building on Sept. 3. At
least as big a crowd as the Melbourne gathering is
expected, but this time the pugilists will share the spoil
after paying exes. The throng which witnessed Felix-
Doherty struggle was probably the biggest ever brought
together by a glove-fight in Australia, bar that when
Goddard and Peter Jackson met in the Crystal Palace,
Richmond (Vic.), 10 or 11 years ago. Other enormous
crowds were those drawn by the Foley-Burke affair on
the old Carrington Grounds, Sydney, and the Slavin-
Burke match in Melbourne. Griffo and Billy Murphy
packed the old York-st. (Sydney) Club at £1 each indi-
vidual twice, while Griffo and Martin Denny and Griffo
and Jerry Marshall bruised before great houses at the old
Darlingliurst Skating Rink, Sydney. Peter Jackson and
Tom Lees (for the Australian championship) 15 or 16
years ago divided a gate totalling perhaps £9OO.

A match ’tween a Victorian greyhound not
named and the N.S.W. top-notcher, Great Heart, for
£lOOO aside, is likely to eventuate if supporters of the
latter find the money. The unknown is generally believed
to be among Tony Lumpkin, The Hermit, or the dividers
(Verse and Planet) of the last Waterloo Cup. Though
only a puppy still Great Heart will make an old man
opponent. So far he has an undefeated record, and
among his successes this season were two Derbies and the
rich N.S.W. Challenge Stakes. Not in any single course
has this remarkably good hound been led to the game,
and only in one instance (then 1J points) has an opponent
notched anything against him.

Publio interest in cycle-racing has been killed in
Sydney by the tactics of the riders. Now an effort is to
be made at its resurrection. The N.S.W. League of
Wheelmen announces a series of big meetings for the end
of this year, prize-money to run into four figures, and
“ Major Taylor ” and other big importations at vast ex-
pense, are coming from America and elsewhere. The
League will need a lot of luck to carry the enterprise
through, for cycling in Sydney seems to have slumped
past reviving. The Sydney Cricket Ground trustees have
long since repented of the construction of that eyesore of
a track round their splendid ground.

Road-race test at Launceston (Tas.), Saturday,

Melbourne bike contest, saw 18 start and eight finish.
Winner turned up in limit man, A. Harding, whose net

Sandow.
“ Fluffy ” to The Bulletin, from Perth, W. A. :
Sandow made his first appearance in Australia before
an audience which filled every corner of Perth Theatre
Royal. Sandow was in the second part of Harry Rickards’
show, Lotty being the chief attraction of the first part.
Lotty apparently represents the available best in woman
form, while Sandow is put forth as all that is ideal in
manly brawn. Sandow stood revealed on a pedestal
with a piece of leopard skin around his loins, and white
tights on his legs ; his magnificent torso, corrugated with
muscles, was in its buff beauty. There were a dozen
poses, and at intervals the pedestal revolved, so that the
serried ranks of muscles lying along his back were brought
to view. Sandow’s development is extraordinary.
• * • •
His face is intelligent and bright, his skin perfectly
healthy, his teeth white and regular (presumably
indigenous), his hair crisp and curly, and his moustache
trained skyward a Id that of William the Sudden. The
face is frequently ablaze with astonishment at Sandow’s
marvellousness. If possible, Sandow is even more amazed
at Sandow than is Perth. One was stricken into silence by
the array of muscles, at one moment in ambush, and at
another leaping to view at the will of the Strong Man.
With a great noise of breathing he deflated his chest,
then, drinking in the air in gallons, he “ expanded ’’ till
there was a united gasp from the audience at a present-
ment that might be called wonderful, but was not with-
out an element of repulsiveness. The posing in th*
limelight was, on the whole, the best part of the show.
The muscle was beyond cavil, the beauty and balance of
the man beyond praise.
• * * •
The scene changing, a counterfeit of the Coliseum was
presented. _ Half-a-dozen Romans specially imported
from Victoria Park stood in attendance, while a few girls
represented the beauty of ancient Italy. The Romans
were probably the smallest that never served in a fish-
shop. The muscles of their brawny legs—they were like
silken bands. Seeing that he supports six on his chest,
Sandow is wise not to have men about him who are fat.
For this act he came mincing on to the stage—mfncing
is the only word. Sandow takes very short, hurried
steps, appears quite stiff at the knees, and grimaces and
gesticulates all the time.
* * * *
No-.v he is going to lift the 1261b. dumb-bell. He comes
down the stage stiff-legged, and does it, clearly and deftly,
with both hands, from the floor, extending the arms slowly
overhead, and then lowering the dumb-bell slowly tf> the
floor, letting it drop the last six inches with a thump.
Then he goes behind the proscenium, so as to get one of
the 17 recalls announced in the advertising colum .s
to-morrow morning. Next he lifts the 2461b. dumb-bell
and minces down the stage. Grips with one hand this
time, bringing in the weight of the body and the leverage.
The mass of iron goes up with a jerk, is brought quickly
back, and thumped upon the floor. Cheers, and yet
more cheers. But the two-handed management of the
lighter toy is the more praiseworthy.
* » * m
Sandow was most insistent on the music being changed
for each new feat. The orchestral scores are very com-
plete and the strong man did not hesitate to give the con-
ductor very marked notice if the music did not change at
the right moment. The tearing of the card-packs, and
the dance of the biceps each had their appropriate accom-
paniment. The “dance” was done with hands clasped
behind the head so that the upper arm was raised and the
muscles in full view. Then, beneath the pink skin, the
flesh was seen to roll about, and to leap rhythmically—a
thing very weird to see.
* * * *
Some men, not very strong, can tear a pack of cards
across. Sandow does this, but he takes one of the halves
and tears that. Then he takes two packs, opening them
from what purports to be original packages, places them
together and tears them. Then he tears three packs.
The three packs are almost a cube, and it is little leverage
that seems available for the task. There is a charac-
teristic theatrical touch that comes after the actual
accomplishment. The tearing is done at the knee/ One
end of the cards is gripped between the right hand and
knee, while the left hand seems to do the tearing. Then
comes the wrench, and the thing is done. Only a few
shreds are left to be severed, but to do this the ends are
brought away from the knee. Sandow braces himself.
His muscles start. With a mighty effort his hands pull
apart, there is crash from the orchestra, and the deed, al-
ready done, is officially accomplished. Meanwhile, one
of the noble Romans has been tying the sundered packs
into bundles. Sandow throws these into the audience
for souvenirs. He throws with an awkward underhand
jerk.
• * * *
Sandow’s last acts are the Roman Column arid the
Tomb of Hercules. The six Romans stand on Sandow’s
chest in the Tomb act, and they do not subdue him. He
rests face upwards on his hands and feet, forming a table
on which platform the six Romans mount, taking with
them all the available dumb-bells and having a face-value
of, say, seven or eight hundredweight.
* * * •
The v\ hole show is a queer mixture of marvel and moon-
shine. The beautiful development of his body and his
enormous strength on the one side, and on the other side
a number of tricks that one expects to find among men
of the Samson class. But most play-actors find it easier
to win applause by bizarre effects than by genuine work.

So far, the Conference of Premiers has
made very little progress in the matter of the pro-
posed preferential duties. Things remain at this
point: That Britain wants Australia to give a
preference to its goods by reduced duties, while
Britain admits the goods of Australia on no better
terms than those of all other countries. Yet, as
we buy more from Britain than Britain buys from
us, it looks as if we had some claim for a preference
to make things square. One reason why “the
colonies” are comparatively unprogressive, and
aren’t in a position to rise up and lick the mother
country’s enemies as they might do, is that the
mother country seems to prefer buying from all
her outside enemies rather than from them.

“Alone,” re “ Galleryite’s ” criticism of
the Irvine Ministry :
“ Galleryite ” is, in one particular, manifestly wrong.
He says, “ Irvine is too haughty even to see his constitu-
ents when they come to the city. That is the way Irvine
and men like him demonstrate their superiority.” Now,
if that statement were strictly true it would be none the
less a compliment to the man, but it isn’t strictly true.
Any of Irvine’s constituents with any business worthy of
the attention of the representative of the whole con-
stituency can rely on seeing him, and getting courteous
consideration. But, whatever his political weaknesses, he
has the statesman’s abhorrence of the sneaking K.va-
bramapootra with his “political-influence” jobs, who
buzzes round the pandering “ roads and culverts ” type
of politician, till Parliament, instead of being an aggre-
gation of the country’s statesmen, is fast degenerating
into a society of glib-tongued log-rollers and mean-
spirited humbugs. In the eye of every Democrat the
comparative exclusiveness of Irvine and a few others is
at least a suggestion of honesty.
Chermside, of Queensland, is the only
Australian Governor who, on his own motion,
proposed a reduction of his yearly salary. From
the days of Gov. Phillip any suggestion (and the
suggestions were frequent) to reduce salary was
always determinedly opposed by the holders of
the office. Finally, the British Govt, laid down
what has had the effect of law since—that the
salary of no Governor is to be reduced during the
term of his office. If Gov. Chermside's voluntary
reduction proposal be accepted, the Colonial Office
may or may not interfere. It certainly will be
quotable as a precedent of a reduction taking
place during the term of occupancy ; but difficul-
ties can be avoided by the Governor accepting his
full salary and donating a cheque to the Consoli-
dated revenue. In a somewhat analogous case
Bruce Smith and other members of N.S.W. Leg.
Assembly, and others in Victoria, declined statu-
tory salaries, but in after years drew them as
arrears of pay.

When the Owe’Sullivan unfurled a banner
recently for N.S.W. railway men he gushed:
“Standards, banners, symbols, and devices have
always played an important part in the history of
humanity.” Not a doubt of it! Because human-
ity has been emerging from barbarism —from the
red-feather and tattoo stage. When men become
really civilised such things will be left to children.
The Purnim giant, the youthful 7ft. 4in.
Gippslander, who has been shown round the coun-
try as a startling natural product, has just applied
for an old age pension, although only 25. The
giant’s heart, it runs, has proved quite unequal to
the task of irrigating his system, arid the doctors
have ordered him on to his back for the remainder
of his days. The Purnim giant made his first ap-
pearance in history when his father was sued for
not sending his little boy to school. The little
boy was called into court, and was found to be
about 2£ft. higher than his father, and large enough
to overawe the Bench. Unluckily for the giant of
Purnim, Nature, in supplying his enormous bulk,
did not fit him with a pump to suit. That is very
often the way with the long man. It is his heart
that gives out first.
The death, at the age of 83, of William
Hanson, first N.S.W. Govt, printer, recalls the
early days of Sydney journalism, when S.M.
Herald had absolutely its own way, scooped in
the shekels, and kept the daily press on a dull
level of sanctimonious propriety. It was after
Henry Parkes had failed to make a success of the
Empire, as a second morning paper, that Samuel
Bennett, a good writer on the Herald staff, and
William Hanson, Govt, printer, tried their ’pren-
tice hands on the costly venture. After a
decade of wearisome and ineffectual battling,
Hanson, heavily handicapped by small means and
a large family, was beaten in the fight. By the
irony of fate, the turning-point in his partner’s
fortune arrived soon after, when the first paper of
its kind in the colony—the Evening News —was
started on the ruins of the Empire, bringing
Bennett his earliest stroke of luck. The estab-
lishment of a weekly journal, Town and Country,
combined with free newspaper postage, completed
his fortune, it being a common sight in the bush
then to see heavily-laden wagons, whose sole
freight consisted of Town and Country, being
delivered at the colony’s expense. There was a
flicker of light in Hanson’s later life, when, at the
age of 70, he compiled two books of reference,
the “ Pastoral Possessions of New South Wales ”
and a “Geographical Gazetteer” of the colony.
But he was practically ruined by the Empire, in
which he had embarked everything, and his life
petered out sadly to the end.
Civilisation largely consists of shifting great
quantities of stuff from one place to another, and the
man who takes such a contract will, if he is wise, use
light tramways to do it. With the’ordinary wheelbarrow
a man can shove about 1801 b. along in front of him. With
a tramline and a truck the same man could easily shift
about a ton. If he used a horse to the trucks he could
shift about 10 tons. Also, with the tramline wet weather
does not decrease the hauling power of man or beast as it
does on an ordinary wet, muddy road. Therefore, if
civilisation has placed you in a station of life in which it
is necessary to hump large quantities of material from one
place to another, see Mr. A. E. Leplastrier, manager of
the Central Tramway Co, 40 Hnuter-street, Sydney, and
he will fix you up with anything in the tram business,
from a wheelbarrow run on one rail up to the best patent
chaired tramline with palatial passenger carriages and
first-class steel mining-trucks.*

“HOW TO PRESERVE THE EYESIGHT.” ~
Ask your Chemist for this little book*
My Melbourne correspondent continues
“Why will the Art Gallery-girl persist in a
robe of an obsolete character ? She is ever the
same as the years revolve. Her style never alters.
She is the slave of a fixed idea—the aesthetic in
dress. Her hair is tangled till it looks like a
disreputable nest. A rose of many a
summer ago is caught in the hair-twigs above her
left ear. Her level figure, devoid of curve or any
suggestion of Vondulation naturelle, is swathed in
a faded pink or a slowly-dying blue drape. She
is anaemic and sad. So, too, is the average male
artist. After a casual glance round at the warped
brethren of the mahl-stick, it is a relief to rest
the eyes on the big, solid, healthy figure of sculp-
tor Summers. Why should Art, as a rule, put on
a lackadaisacal dying-duck-in-a-thunderstorm
pose?
“At last the secret leaks out why Mrs. Martell
sent in her resignation as the well-paid resident
surgeon of the Women’s Hospital. Mrs. Martell
was treated like a lady-help. She couldn’t take a
breath of fresh air without much detail of per-
mission. Her recreation hours were severely
limited, in consequence of the casual visits of
patients in their extremity. It was required that
she should be always on the spot, ready for all
emergency cases. She felt the strain of continuous
duty, but conscious that she had been warmly
welcomed into the institution by the Catmittee,
and received into the feminine fold with much
grateful mewing, worked on against all odds. At
last her husband interposed, offering to be on
duty while his wife took some rest, but this sug-
gestion the Catmittee squashed immediately and
put a resolute claw down on all infringements of
the most minor rules. So Mrs. Martell handed
in her notice of retirement.
“ A Melbourne August bride is preparing to
take Sydney by storm (she is wedding a well-set-
up widower of Harborville). The lace designed
for the bridal toilette has been made by a sister,
and is claimed by a big chiffon establishment to
be the most exquisite work ever turned out by an
amateur needle-dodger. Yards of this precious
cob-web finery drape the skirt; more of it forms
the vest and sleeves.
“ The dress-builders of the day are raising their
charges immoderately, on the plea of the extra
labor of the needle involved by present fashion of
dresses. The smart society girl who once ran up
her own frock is unable to emulate the elaborate
modes of the day, and the home-made dress is
no longer a possibility. So the dress despots
are making life a vale of tribulation and tears
in a depressed community.
“ A girl is doing Collins-st. these days with an
ebony cane. Every now and then a girl breaks
out with the stick craze, but finds the fashion
doesn’t prosper much. One who leads her Pomera-
nian poodle by a silver chain is a bigger draw.
“The small sister of Amy Castles is being
coached diligently in French, German, and
Italian, preparatory to starting on a singing tour.
The fair, pretty, pert young ‘ Dolly ’ is a smarter
girl than Amy —more precocious and more appre-
ciative of this world’s possessions.
“ A certain prominent official gives private
views to his friends of the golden gewgaw presented
by the Ducal Atom last year. ‘Come to tea,’ he
says, ‘and I’ll show you the Duke’s present to
me.’ The tea he gives first, and the private view
after. This has been his chief amusement ever
since this State lost the fragrant presence of
Royalty. Only womenkind go, and even they
giggle inordinately. The faded flowers of crawlty
are not sentimental —only funny.
“Both the Melb. morning papers have paid
‘An Australian Girl in London ’ the compli-
ment of copying her article, ‘ The Omnibus Top,’
from the (London) Daily Mail. The writer,
‘M.C.E.’, is Mrs. Elkington, wife of Dr. ‘Jack’
Elkington, who is now in London studying small-
pox at headquarters, to qualify for a S.P.H.
degree. Mrs. Elkington, a sister of Mrs. Norman
Lindsay, is a clever, attractive girl who talks well
and writes as naturally as she talks.
“Mr. Justice Williams’ imposing daughter
sports a most artistic winter garb these veiled
days of frost and calm. It is a cinnamon-brown,
concertina-like velvet,- made with a very pouched
blouse and the long, plain, trailing, germ-collecting
tail. With it the theatrical-looking charmer
sports a jaunty toque of plateau shape, veiled in
cinnamon tulle, with delicate pink flower borders
about the rim and spreading over the crown.
The brown autumn tint is very telling.
“The ‘kitchen tea’ is catching on like Kya-
bramapootra reform. The idea, that must surely
have orginated in a poor quarter where the ddt-
less bride was in quandary to start the time-pay-
ment home, has set smart Society by the ears,
and every swagger bride these days approves of
her friends furnishing her kitchen in this hoydenish
manner.
“A whole ball was spoilt _ the other night
through a small and trivial mistake. A box of
floor-wax, looking like the legitimate face-powder,
but really composed of candle-grease and other
slippery stuff, was left on the dressing table of the
cloak-room. Girls excitedly rushing in, and
peeling off cloaks and wraps, made a dab
at the powder-box and whitened their cold
red noses. The stuff stuck horribly. It had
a strange feeling and a stranger smell. The
girls turned to each other asking the reason,
and then commenced furiously rubbing it off—or
rather in. The effect was ludicrous. Others who
had rouged their faces before coming washed the
hateful stuff out with their vexed tears. The
dressing-room presented a strange scene, and red-
nosed unhappy girls faced the music in sulks, and
in earnest prayer that the night would pass quickly
and end their humiliation.
“ An evil form of the three-quarter coat, which
seems to be one of the possessions of every happy
home, is the latest white lustre and linen variety.
The long, loose hang of the white linen thing,
with its two side slits, resembles so closely
a certain male garment of the common or garden
variety, that even the hardy annual sort of
woman blushes at the sight of it. At a recent
race-meeting a well-advertised widow wore such a
garment in green cloth, over a gorgeous black-
and-white frock, and mere man wanted to know
in his brutal fashion why she covered such a
wealth of material with a man’s shirt.
“Letters from Alice Crawford give glowing
accounts of the happy family relations existing in
Wilson Barrett’s co. The big bouncing Alice had
one grave fault which her friends were ever
striving to correct in her. She had no ‘ applica-
tion,’ and did not (they say) ever do herself and
her talents justice. What she learnt, she acquired
in a hasty way, and was a young person much
given to lounging luxuriously and lending a hand-
some ear to the encouraging eulogies of her
friends. But her recent letters show an emulative
spirit. Alice Crawford has the necessary tem-
perament, and a rather magnetic presence.

Address —L.D.I
Cardinal Ledochowski, just dead, whose
shoes Cardinal Moran is said to have an eye on
was gaoled by Bismarck on one occasions for an
infraction of anti-clerical laws.
Emphatic attention was called to the abs
sence of means of communication with the guard'
of long-distance Vic. trains by the recent sen-
sational trouble with a suicidal madman, who
wished to jump out. The passengers right along
the tram were helpless spectators of what threat-
ened every moment to be a ghastly horror; but
the guard and the men in charge of the engine
were quite unconscious of events until a gang of
line-repairers happened in sight, just in time to
stop the tram and prevent the madman’s brains
being dashed out against a post. On some of the
Vic. lines, trains, running for full-hour stretches
without stoppage, are without any means of
drawing the attention of the guard when anything
goes wrong.
A Melbourne father appeared in the dock,
the other day, charged with manslaughter of his
daughter, aged 10. The child had been ill in bed for
13 months, and the evidence of three doctors was
absolutely horrifying. “ She was in a low condi-
tion and filthy and neglected. . . Never saw such
a number of bed-sores on any human being before.
• • •. She must have suffered untold agony for a
considerable period. . . She was extremely ema-
ciated and extremely dirty. . . Nails of hands
and feet were fully an inch long and grown into
the flesh. . . The child was covered with dirt
from head to foot, and the dirt had to be scraped
from her ; the hair was full of vermin.” At the
hospital it took four hours to cleanse her. Certain
medicos advised her removal to the hospital, but
another, since dead, was against it, and as the
child herself disliked the notion, nothing was
done until too late. The father, who was dis-
charged by the Judge’s direction, seems to have
done all in his power except to personally attend to
the little one’s physical needs ; that he left to his
eldest daughter, aged 27 (his wife was dead). The
child apparently died through dirt, neglect, and
through everybody’s business being nobody’s busi-
ness. Brethren, Brother Snufflebust will now
take up a collection for the heathens in China,
who abandon some of their new-born girl-babies.
At the Sydney Cyclorama, old Jerusalem,
after years of service, has given place to the old
Battle of Gettysburg, and the tin thunder that
expressed Hebrew alarm now comes in useful for
war effects. It is a pale green and yellow
battle, with real bottles in the foreground
and a painted haystack in the middle dis-
tance. Most people go to a Cyclorama feel-
ing annoyed because they are sure they will
be able to see through the illusion; they leave
feeling equally annoyed because they can’t. The
point where the real and unreal meet may, of
course, be distinguished by sharp-sighted persons.
Nevertheless, the pale, green hills have the neces-
sary distant look, and the misty American sky
extends far over what ought to be Redfern rail-
way station. Twice a day someone sings the
usual war-ballad about the soldier who says
“Mother,” and a lecturer makes remarks
on the leaders Lee, Ewell, &c. Jackson
wasn’t there, being unavoidably dead. Jack-
son was the Confederate leader who didn’t
shoot the aged lady for waving the wrong flag
over him. In all ages certain women have been
much praised for saying “ Shoot, if you will, this
old, grey head” (or young head), under circum-
stances when it is certain that the head in question,
being feminine, won’t be shot. These cases are
then instanced by lady lecturers as showing that
women are as brave as men. The Cyclorama con-
cludes with some ordinary illusion effects and a
cinematograph, mainly of a bucking horse, which
sometimes bucks on the top of the canvas and
sometimes plunges underneath, owing to apparent
insobriety on the part of the cinematograph.
The greatest relief has been furnsihed
mothers by the introduction of the
Baby Jumper. It works on springs,
and the slightest movement of the
child causes it to rock, and the in-
fant goes off to sleep—in fact, one
father describes it as saving wages
of two nurse-girls. It is on sale
at Lassetter’s, Hordern’s, Farmer’s,
in Sydney; at Finny Isle’s, in Bris-
bane ; and at Tye’s, in Melbourne.

New Zealand Loan and M. A. Co., Ltd., reports
—for week ended July 26th—that wool has been in
steady private demand at same old prices. At London
July sales quotations remained unchanged; merinos
firm ; crossbreds in better demand. Sheepskin supplies
are very heavy, but the majority are skins taken from
starved sheep. Market firm for fine-woolled, but weaker
for coarser and rougher sorts. No shipping inquiry for
tallow, which nevertheless maintains its prices. Strong
inquiry for kangaroo, wallaroo and wallaby skins. Swamp
wallabies made very high.’ Possums fell from6d. tolsd. doz.
Lightweight hides much neglected, supplies from starved
cattle being large. Fairly animated demand for other
descriptions and weights at about last week’s rates.
Hoofs and horns in active demand. Horsehair advanced
Jd. per lb. Wheat still ranges from 4s. 4d. to 4s. 4Jd. in
the city, while the co. has paid the Sydney equivalent of
4s. sd. to 4s. 6d. for several parcels in the country for
stock-feeding purposes. Maize still selling at 4s. lid. to
6s. per bushel, but considerable shipments from Argentina
are expected to cause a slump. Flour : On actual sales
best City Roller is worth £9 10s., and other brands
£8 10s. to £9 ss. per ton ; Manitoba, £l2 10s.
While in S’Africa, King Seddon did some
tall talking; his continual reiteration of “we
intend to present you with a fleet of steamers to
open up direct communication between S’Africa
and Maoriland,” made the Natalians espe-
cially very angry. They resented the pat-
ronising manner of. the “ great Imperialist,”
and at one meeting an old man asked
him in Taal if the steamers were to be
presented to the Govts, of Natal and Cape
Colony, and did the M.L. farmers and manufac-
turers hope to make any profit out of the presen-
tation. Dick squelched this ignorant disloyalist
by starting to belch “ Gorsave ” in his most terrific
basso, and, after that, there were no more inter-
ruptions. He made a bellowing pandemonium,
and called it approval.
At Poverty Point.
Henry Irving and Ellen Terry, it is said, have deter-
mined to undertake an Australian tour. No doubt —they
already call her Ellen Tarry in London.
“ W.K.H.”: “ Who were the three Lelliots who are now
appearing in America, and are said to be Australians ? ”
The Lelliots came from Deniliquin (N.S.W.) Several of
the sons showed great musical talent, as boys. One of
them was a clever violinist, and another was a very fine
trombone player. I heard some time ago than the
Lelliots were in America. The boys were carpenters by
trade, but all the family were very musical.
If Mrs. Pat. Campbell comes to Australia under engage-
ment to Musgrove (she is not coming under engagement
to Williamson, anyhow) what will the lady of the highly-
strung nerves produce for her trump-card ? She has three
or four brilliant successes to her name, and several
failures. Mrs. Tanqueray and Magda are her strongest
parts. There might be some money in “ Magda,” because
an artistic and whole-hearted treatment of the character
in which Nance O’Neil bluffed Australia with her huge
self-assurance would be a revelation. But “ Tanqueray ”
has been played again and again, by the Broughs, to
moderate business.
Kelly, employed as “ the Terrible Turk ” in Williamson’s
“ Circus Girl,” at Melb. Majesty’s, is an ex-policeman, and
the largest on the job. He looks quite 7ft. high along-
side Lauri, and probably weighs little less than 30st.
He is, perhaps, the nearest approach to the giants of the
fairy tales that Victoria has produced, and has taken
prizes in his time as a thing of beauty. His first appear-
ance on any stage was at a Bendigo carnival, where he
took the cake for beauty, grace, and style in a handsome-
man competition, winning on points of weight and
measurement.
S.M. Herald stated last week that Melba would cer-
tainly be re-introduced to the Australian public at Mel-
bourne Town Hall, and not at the Princess’s Theatre or
the Exhibition Building. All the Bame, S.M.H. doesn’t
know. It merely surmises.
“ Melb.” : The amateur “ Runaway Girl,” on the press
verdict, was excellent —so it was. Book Arcadian Cole’s
monkeys turned loose on the stage. All monkeyed.
Everyone of them was a mere mimic’s mimic, imita-
tor of the player at Her Majesty’s. The ghosts of Carrie
Moore, Florrie Young, Lauri, Ward, Vernon, Bantock,
and so on down to the humblest. Three months’ inces-
sant devotion to this balderdash can only come to such a
result. Fathers and mothers tearing their hair.
“ T.D.” : One thing I notide about Piddock, the bari-
tone of “ A Chinese Honeymoon,” is that he’s a genuine
worker ; it seems difficult to get tenors and baritones of
that stamp nowadays. They mostly stand round when
not actually singing or talking, strike attitudes, and
endeavor to look pretty. But Piddock, and Kenningham
of the rival show, both set good examples to their col-
leagues by keeping on the move, and for that reason they
are worth much more to the management than the help-
less personages aforesaid.
“ E.S.” : Music teachers of Melbourne are recommend-
ing their pupils to copy the American soprano, Electa
Gifford, as to methods of breathing. The sages of the
singing world say her method is perfect. No effort, cer-
tainly, is apparent. Her throat is small and graceful. It
is better to watch that than her mouth when she sings,
for her beauty is completely sacrificed in the engineering
of those artistic vocal passages, and her small mouth (its
brevity is a blessing) forms loops, and circles, and slots,
and egg-shapes as she sends out her notes.
“ Vul.”: Re Cinquevalli’s unique feat of catching a
heavy cannon ball upon his neck from a dizzy height. He
tells an American interviewer how he learned the trick.
“ I began learning with a wooden bail, weighing about
lib. Even then it often knocked me unconscious. But I
kept on practising, and gradually increased the weight of
the ball. Yes, I catch it on the back of my neck. Of
course, if I made the least mistake there would be a bad
accident. Afterwards, I throw the ball into the air and
catch it on the edge of a plate. I can do the same feat
with an egg. I practised the trick tor nine years before I
performed it in public.”
The reason pianist Lachaume could not be persuaded
at the last moment to accompany Gerardy to Australia
was that his wife objected either to part from or travel
overseas with him- a state of things that bodes badly
for Lachaume’s future as a musician and a man of soui.
Canby was lucky in picking up, instead of Lachaume, the
businesslike Gottfried Galston, probably the most un-
affected star pianist yet seen in Australia. Galston goes
far to disprove the apparent belief that the strength of a
musician, life Samson’s of old, lies in the possession of
a huge thatch.
Alfred Harding, of Melbourne, cut his
throat in the City Baths. In choosing such a
place, Alfred showed consideration and good feel-
ing, but the job was not a striking success. He
lost a good deal of blood, but did not find himself
dying as readily as he had expected. Growing
weary of waiting he tied up his neck with a
handkerchief, went home in a casual sort of way,
and after mooning about the house for a while
went to bed. This happened on Sunday, and
Harding turned up at Melb. Hospital on the
following Friday, and presented himself for -
repairs. It was found that the main artery had !
been cut half through, but that the bleeding had
been stopped almost miraculously by a little con- I
gealed blood in the wound. It took a few yards
of material to sew Alfred up again, and now he is '
fit to fell trees.

SUFFERERS.
What you ware you may never be again,
In this lies the lesson we would teach.
Perchance i
may be of benefit to those still in the flesh.
WHAT THE WORLD’S SCIENTISTS SAY-
THAT half of the nervous affections from which people suffer arise through imperfect and insufficient nerve force. Rob the body of animal magnetism, and paralysis and dis-
order of the chief functions follow. Pluck a flower —it withers. The principle is the same. It is one which involves Death. _ . .
Physicians of the widest experience and highest attainment declare that where nervous disorders arise from structural changes in the great nerve centres, the treatment
which lends itself with direct adaptability and possessing most curative results is that of Electricity combined with medical treatment. Many eminent professional medical experts
assert this fact —that where nervous exhaustion and functional disorders are present, symptoms show themselves in sleeplessness, great muscular debility, headache, backache, mental
incapacity, loss of appetite with dyspepsia, and constipation, weariness or a condition of weariness and unrest. The intensity and variety of these symptoms indicate how greatly
the system is affected.
Electricity adopted judiciously with restorative medicines have powerful reconstructive influences. An electric “ Invigorator.” worn around the loins for a few hours'
nightly will effect a great and lasting change by pouring into the nerves that necessary vitality which being absent forms the nucleus of disease.
Read the two following testimonials from persons who have suffered and tried the treatment. Then if you are ill, consult the Specialists and speak likewise.
TESTIMONY.
JOCKEYS, CYCLISTS, ATHLETES, SEND
US VOLUNTARY AFFIRMATIONS,
Mr. Joseph Megson, Champion Cy-
clist of New South Wales, declares :
_ “I suffered from nervousness for sorri"
time. I was on the point of a constitutional
break-up more than once. The merits of
your Electric ‘ Invigorator,’ as supplied to
me, are beyond question.
(Signed) “J. MEGSON, 1902.”
(There is no mistaking this striking testi-
mony.)
1 Certain Reliable
Cure for Ren.
MEN want to know where they can be
cured. This is most important to
them. THEY WANT THIS KNOW-
LEDGE STRIAGHT AWAY. Perhaps
they hear of others cured. People COME
ALL THE WAY from the Gulf of Car-
pentaria and Western Australia and GET
RELIEVED OF THEIR TROUBLES.
The SPECIALISTS of the INSTITUTE
cure, not only WEAKNESS IN MEN,
' but they TONE UP THE REPRODUC-
TIVE SYSTEMS, and so thoroughly reno-
vate the body generally that the thought of
calamity dies permanently. They have in
their' secretarial chamber OVER 10,000
TESTIMONIALS from men CURED of
EXHAUSTION and GENERAL DE-
BILITY. The system of the Specialists is
entirely new, and is in effect a combination
of Medicine and Electricity. Electricity is
Life, and an Electric-“ In vigorator ” worn
around the waist for a few weeks, instilling
into the system a gentle, remedial -current,
re-invigorates the entire nervous system.
Worn whilst a course of medicine is taken,
this* systexh- will conquer the worst case v of
“ weakness ” endured by men.
Anyone suffering from Chronic forms of
DYSPEPSIA, INDIGESTION, CON-
STIPATION, ORGANIC or FUNC-
TIONAL NERVE DISORDERS, PAL-
PITATION, EPILEPSY, NEURALGIC
AFFECTIONS, HEADACHES, BACK-
ACHES, Rheumatism, lumbago,
INSOMNIA, ENFEEBLED CONDI-
TION, GOUT, should write to the
SPECIALISTS and state fully their symp-
toms. Patients write to the Institute from
all parts of Australia, and are treated in
their own homes as well as if they had
visited the Specialists personally.

much notoriety has recently arisen in

you of disease, but our “ Invigor-
ators,” used with our medicines, accom-
plishes that , which neither electricity or
medicine alone can do. The two together
have wonderful renovative effects, and con-
tain reconstructive elements in cases of
degenerated and enfeebled constitutions
which amaze the medical Faculty. Our
“ Invig'orators ” are the only ones tested
by two of Sydney’s leading electricians.
We hold certificates of genuineness unpos-
sessed by others. We have several classes,
which vary in value according to cost of
construction. Our £lO instrument contains
the same current as those at £1 (which we
specially recommend), but it also contains
2oz. of 18ct. gold, which raises the value.
If you require a test privately it will be
given you.
We ask you to read these prices and then
give one of these instruments a trial. What-
ever you suffer from where your natural
strength and nerve power is lacking, you
will be strengthened. The desire of a man
is to be with the victors, not the vanquished.
To be strong, hearty, healthy—that is your
desire, and it is the effect of the use of this
instrument.

A COMPLETE CURE.
Mr. W. G. Hearne.—Dear Sir,—l am writing to tell you
about the wonderful cure your medicine has effected in
my case. About three years ago I began to cough. At
first the cough was not severe, but it gradually got worse,
and I became very weak and troubled with night sweats,
pain in my chest, and great quantities of phlegm. On
several occasions there was blood in the expectorated
matter. I had been treated by a doctor, who pronounced
myrease to be Consumption, and various other treatments
had been tried, but without benefit. It was at this stage
that I heard of your Bronchitis Cure, and sent to you for
a'course of the medicine. When it arrived I was too ill to
leave my bed, but I commenced taking it at once, and
gradually improved. lam glad to say that the two lots
of medicine you sent have effected a complete cure, for
which accept my very best thanks.—Yours gratefully,
J. BLAIR.

“Mr. W. G. Hearne, Geelong.—
“ Dear Sir, —
Your letter and Bronchitis Cure to hand quite safe.
I am sure you will be glad to know that your Bronchitis
Cure has quite cured me. I was very glad when it came,
as I was suffering from a severe attack of Bronchitis at the
time it arrived. I had sent for my own doctor, but had
not had one night’s rest for a week. I started taking the
Bronchitis Cure three times a day as directed, and was
very much eased at once. At the end of a week I only
took it twice a day, and then only every night for a
week, as I was so much better when, thanks to the Lord
for adding His blessing, I was quite well, and walked into
town and back without feeling any fatigue. I had not
done that, previously for 12 months—always went in the
omnibus —as walking caused me such pain and distress in
the chest. I always walk now, and never feel it, and I
am stronger than I have been for years. I thank my son
for his great kindness in sending the medicine, and am,
dear Sir,
“Yours very truly,
“M. MORTIMER.’
Extract from a letter, since written by the same lady to
her son, Mr. John S. Mortimer, Llenwellyn, ICatunga,
Victoria.
HER DAUGHTER HAD BEEN VERY ILL.
SPITTING UP BLOOD.
THE DOCTOR SAID NOTHING MORE COULD BE
DONE.
CURED BY HEARNE S BRONCHITIS CURE.
The extract runs as follows “As for myself, thank
the Lord, lam feeling stronger than I have for years. I
had an attack of Bronchitis in November, but Hearne s
Bronchitis Cure was again successful. I feel quite well-,
and walk into town feeling quite strong.
“ I must ask you to send me six bottles more ot tne
medicine, as I wish to have a supply in the house. _ I
have tried to get it made up here, and let my chemist
have a bottle to see what he could do. He tells me this
week he can make nothing out of it, he never saw any-
thing like it before, so there is only one thing for me to
do —send for more. I have never kept in bed one day
since I commenced to take it. I used to be in bed a fort-
night at a time always, and after that for months I was
as weak as I could possibly be, and was always taking
cod liver oil, so you will see at once it is quite worth
while sending for it such a long distance.
“ Something more I must tell you. Charlotte has been
very ill since I wrote you. Her cough was so bad she
never had a night's rest, and was spitting up blood
verv much. The doctor told her husband that there was
nothing more he could do for her. So on the Sunday I
sent her half a bottle of the Bronchitis Cure, and told
her to try it, and if she did not use it, not to waste it,
but send it back again. She had such confidence in her
doctor that I thought she would not try it. On the
Wednesday I sent over again, and she was much better,
the night’s rest was very good, and cough and bleeding
from the lungs better. She sent for another half-bottle,
and on the following Sunday sent over to say that she
was quite cured and did not require any more medicine.
So you see what great good it has done, and she wishes
to have some of my next supply.”

A Seven Years’ Case.
EXPECTORATING BLOOD AND MATTER.
COMPLETELY CURED.
“ Mr. W. G. Hearne.
“ Dear Sir, —Your medicine has cured me of bronchitfc
and asthma, from which I suffered for upwards of seven
years, during which period I was scarcely ever free fron*
coughs, and frequently the difficulty of breathing was so
distressing that for nights in succession I had to sit up.
I write you this acknowledgment from a sense of duty, as
in my case every other treatment had failed. For a year
previous I had been getting very much worse, and at the
time I obtained your medicine I was confined to bed
suffering from a most violent cough, expectorating blood
and matter, and apparently beyond hope of recovery.
The first dose of the medicine gave me welcome relief,
and I steadily improved as I continued the treatment,
until I became, as I am now, quite well. —Yours sincerely,
H. WALKER, Balmain, Sydney.”
Asthma.
PREVIOUS TREATMENT FAILED.
A SEVENTEEN YEARS’ CASE.
CURED BY THREE BOTTLES.
Mr. Alex. J. Anderson, of Oak Park, Charleville,
Queensland, writes : —“After suffering from Asthma for
17 years, and having been under a great many different
treatments without benefit, I was induced to try Hearne’s
medicine for Asthma. After taking three bottles of this
medicine I quite got rid of the Asthma, and since then,
which was in the beginning of 1883— 16years ago—l have
not had the slightest return of it. The medicine quite
cured me, and I have much pleasure in recommending it.”
Writing again on the 4t.h April, 1899, he states:—“l
am keeping very well now. Never have the slightest
return of the Asthma.”

A strange story of the suddenness of a,
panic-stricken Melbourne drapery firm. First of
all the firm (Foy and Gibson) sold a bag to a com-
plete stranger and took payment by a cheque for
£1 signed “Brown.” When the bag and the
alleged Brown had departed, somebody suddenly
rushed to the conclusion that the firm had been
swindled, and a young-man fled into the street to
seize Brown. He found Grim Wood instead, and
accused him of being Brown. Grimwood, in-
stead of casting the young man into the middle ot
next week, went with him to the shop, and
was there enthusiastically identified as Brown. A
detective was called and decided, on seeing Grim-
wood’s writing, that he was almost certainly the
man who wrote out the alleged Brown’s cheque.
He then arrested, the protesting Grimwood tor
“stealing a bag”—he had no bag about him, am
there was no sign of one being dropped in the
street—and ran him in. Later on, a detective
went out to inquire at Grimwood’s house, but
he was bundled off the premises. It took
Mrs. Grimwood four hours interviewing seven
different J’s.P. before she got her old man bailed
out. Next day Grimwood was remanded for
a week. And about this time the excited drapery
firm discovered that Brown was an affluent' citizen
whose cheque was quite good, and that Grimwood
was also a decent and “substantial” citizen who
couldn’t be arrested with impunity. The large
firm which made such a large row about
a small cheque is now so subdued that
either Brown or' Grimwood could buy an
umbrella there on credit any day. But as an
eSsay on the value of identifications the whole
business is instructive. If Brown’s cheque had
proved had, and if Grimwood had been a man
without property or influence, he might have got
12 months or so quite off-handedly, by reason of
the cheerful readiness of everybody to recognise
him at first sight. Many men have got more than
that under similar circumstances.
HAVE YOU
A BAD LEG
with Wounds that Discharge or otherwise, perhaps sur-
rounded with inflammation and swollen that when you
press your finger on the inflamed part it leaves the impres-
sion ? If so, under the skin you have poison that defies all
the remedies you have tried, which, if not extracted, yon
never can recover, but go on suffering till death releases
you. Perhaps your knees are swollen, the joints being
ulcerated; the same with the ankles, round which the skin
may be discoloured, or there may; be wounds ; the disease
if allowed to continue will deprive you of the power to
walk. You may have attended various hospitals and had
medical advice, and been told your case is hopeless, or
advised to submit to amputation ; but do not, for I CAN
CURE YOU. I don’t say perhaps ; but I WILL. Because
others have failed is no reason for not now being cured,

Herr RASSMUSSEM
THE WORLD-FAMED DANISH
HERBALIST & BOTANIST,
PROPRIETOR OF THE
ALFALIWE HERBAL REMEDIES
REGISTERED.
A FEW WORDS TO THE UNINITIATED.
PERSONAL AND PERTINENT. —Those who have Dot met Herr Rassmussen, and
who have not given his Alfaline Herbal Remedies a trial, may find it beneficial to become
acquainted with the good work which he has done in the interest of suffering humanity for
the last twenty years.
ALONG BACK IN THE BEGINNING OF THE EIGHTIES
Ilerr Rassmussen introduced his noxv world-famed Alfaline Herbal Remedies to the Australian public at 547 George
Street, Sydney. Australia was then flooded with American importations and proprietary remedies, manufactured
by doubtful persons with assumed names and fictitious addresses, who took the people’s money without
responsibility, and very often without giving them fair value for same.
HERR RASSMUSSEN BROUGHT ABOUT A REVOLUTION
by straightforward and fair dealings with the public, offering to stake his reputation and future if his remedies
were not as efficacious as he claimed them to be, accepting all responsibility, and willing to abide by the people’s
verdict.
THE HAPPY RESULT IS KNOWN TO EVERYONE.
Over twenty years have passed away, hundreds of remedies have come and gone—many of them were forced on
the public in numerous designing ways—thousands of pounds spent on advertising same with the assistance of the
world’s grea est experts in laying traps for the unwary ; but the public would have none of them, and they have
disappeared as suddenly as a flash of lightning.
“THE ALFALINE REMEDIES EXCELL ALL OTHERS,”
and are well known to be more popular to-day than they have ever been. They have not only obtained, but
have retained the goodwill and confidence of the Australian public, and have become famous throughout the
civilized world. The first Sydney Office not only yet exists, but offices have been opened up for their sale at
Melbourne, Brisbane, Adelaide, .Wellington, N.Z., and in West Australia at Perth, Fremantle, Italgoorlie and
Boulder City, with Agencies throughout the world.
LET THE PUBLIC JUDGE FROM THE FOLLOWING
The Alfaline Remedies have held their own for over twenty years in Australia, and Herr Rassmusscii has
been awarded the Parisian Acadamies’ Go: .I Medal and Diploma of Honour ; Gold Medal, Sydney, and several’Silvor
Medals ; honourably mentioned in almost every newspaper in Australia; received many thousands of unsolicited
testimonials—every one of the originals open for inspection at his Offices. The Alfaline Remedies have never been
known to fail to cure in a single instance.
ARE THEY NOT WORTH A TRIAL?
if they are, why not try them to day ? why leave it till to-morrow and, perhaps, lose your chance and time ? No
order so small that it is not welcome ; no order so large that it cannot be executed at once. If you first wish
evidence of the efficacy of the Alfaline Remedies,
SEND FOR HIS FREE BOOK,
and read what the experienced have to say, and what the Australian newspapers have to say—the double distilled
extracts from the Press speak for themselves.

NATURE’S TRIUMPHANT REMEDY.
Kutnow’s Powder
The Infallible Remedy for
Constipation, Stomach, Kidney
Trouble, Liver Torpor, Gout,
Rheumatism, and Uric Acid
Diseases^
i >'”»—■ W
KUTNOW’S POWDER is acknowledged to be the
proper remedy for all such ailments.
KUTNOW’S POWDER is a perfect organic cleanser
and the safety-valve of health. It has the same medicinal
curative and healing properties as the waters of the Royal
and Imperial European Spas, without their drastic and
lowering effects.
KUTNOW’S POWDER possesses the power of eliminat-
ing the poison produced in the blood from an excess of bile
and acids. The use of KUTNOW’S POWDER thereby
gives tone to the system; and, in assisting to build up
healthy tissue, becomes the first aid to a vigorous consti-
tution.
Beware of Fraudulent
Imitations.
KUTNOW’S POWDER may be obtained in capsuled bottles, of
all Chemists and Medicine Vendors. See that the Registered Trade
Mark, “ Hirschensprung ” (or Deer Leap), and the autograph facsimile
signature, “S. K TIT NOW and Co. (Ld. ),” are on the label and carton.
ONLY THESE ENSURE GENUINENESS. INSIST ON
“KUTNOW’S,” AND FIRMLY REFUSE ANY SUBSTI-
TUTES ; THEY ARE WORTHLESS AND OFTEN INJURIOUS.
Constipation neglected or unskilfully
treated becomes habitual or chronic, and
is responsible for hiost of the ills which
flesh is heir to. Most people, when sick,
whether from INDIGESTION, DYS-
PEPSIA, . BILIOUSNESS, SICK
HEADACHE, FLATULENCE, NAU-
SEA, .SOUR ERUCTATIONS,
VOMITING, or HEARTBURN, fly to
the aid of drastic purgatives, pills, salts,
or noxious oils, the use of which means a
passing relief, but which (as most medi-
cal men declare) afterwards increase the
constipation, and thereby accentuate the
ailment. Of all the innumerable reme-
dies (offered to the public) for the cure of
constipation there is only one which
absolutely meets the natural necessities
of this frequently recurring evil—viz.,
KUTNOW’S POWDER, the safety-
valve of Health.
KUTNOW’S POWDER is
used in ail the
principal Hospitals
throughout the
Universe, including
the Field Hospitals
in South Africa.
DR. BRACHET.
Head Physician at the Baths at Aix-les-Bains,
in writing, said:
“For patients suffering from disorders of the Stomach, Liver, and
Bowels I have prescribed ‘ KUT NOW’S Improved Effervescent
Carlsbad POWDER,’ and by its aid obtained the best results. Have
prescribed the powder for about a year in my hospital practice here, as
well as frequently for my private patients, and find it also efficient in
Gout and Rheumatism. I consider KUTNOW’S POWDER indis-
pensable to persons travelling.”
SIR JOHN B. MONCKTON,
Town Clerk of London,
writes :
“Guildhall, London, E.C., Nov. 4th, 1901.
“Gentlemen, —I have much satisfaction in stating that for the last
two years I have regularly used KUTNOW’S POWDER, with the
result that troublesome and frequent attacks of lumbago, with
other gouty symptoms that had troubled me for years, seem
to have entirely disappeared. “Yours truly,
“ JOHN B. MONCKTON.”

“ Entirely unsolicited, I am anxious to bear my testimony to the

CURATIVE
Your indigestion means a starved body, a
dull brain, shattered nerves, an aching head,
tired limbs, torturing pains, restless nights, a
broken constitution, and premature old age unless
you root it out at once with Mother Seigel’s Cura-
tive Syrup. This great herbal remedy exerts a unique
curative and invigorating influence upon the organs of
digestion, and has brought health and vigour to countless
thousands of half-dead dyspeptics.. It did all this for Miss
C. Halton, and it can do the same for you. She suffered
agonies for quite three years from indigestion and anaemia,
and found a perfect cure in Mother Seigel’s Curative Syrup.
Writing from New St., Brighton, Victoria, she says: “ When I
first started taking Mother Seigel’s Curative Syrup. I was a
living skeleton, pallid as a ghost, and weak as an infant. Now I
have a hearty appetite, and can go through a day s work with any
woman in Victoria.” Such testimony affords conclusive proof that

201 Bourke Street, Melbourne
Lost.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
There were three of us—Caddy the musician,
Bourke, and myself. Caddy was a thin, small-
sized man, and I was no giant, but Bourke was a
fine, big, upstanding fellow with broad shoulders
and a long black beard of which he was inordi-
nately proud. Sometimes, when in a mood of
romantic reminiscence, he would caress this fall
of hair with both hands and remark: “This is
what makes them leave their situations. ” He had
been captain in a dragoon regiment at one time
and had sold-out. That was in the good old days
when a commission had a cash value in the market.
There appeared to be good old days almost every-
where at that period, and so when Bourke arrived
in Victoria bearing introductions to the right kind
of people he found no difficulty in obtaining an
excellent Government billet. He lost it on
Black Wednesday—that Day of Judgment for so
many high-placed Victorian civil servants. Then
he went into partnership with a contractor, and,
as he knew nothing of business, and the contractor
knew more than enough for two, he lost his capi-
tal, and took to the bush. Not with a gun, how-
ever, but with a swag. That was how we made
his acquaintance. Caddy and I were sundowning
our way from Melbourne to Queanbeyan, where
we hoped to find a friend who owned a gold-mine.
We met Bourke on the other side of Albury. He
was on his way to Urana to get a job at burr-
cutting. But his heart was not wedded to the
prospect, and he agreed to throw in his lot with
us and become one of the partners in the gold-
mine, if there proved to be one.
So we found ourselves leaving Tumut with two
large loaves, some tea and sugar, and a leg of
mutton. We had to buy these, as there is a pre-
judice in the towns against sundowners. Caddy
was the smallest man of the company, but he
carried the biggest swag, because he hated to pass
by anything he saw lying around loose, and
which he thought might come in handy later on.
So it happened that when we left Tumut his swag
was increased in weight to the extent of six or
seven pounds by the addition of a shovel-blade
wfjich he picked up on the road. “ It will make a
fine frying-pan,” he said. Bourke looked at me,
but neither of us smiled. If Caddy chose to
make a pack-mule of himself by carrying luxuries,
why should we discourage him ? The benefit
would be ours also.
* * * *
I remember well the last homestead we called at
before we were lest to civilisation. It was a cattle-
station, and, from the munificent manner in which
we were treated, it was evident that sundowners
were rare birds of passage in that part of the
country. They brought us out roast beef on a
lordly dish, and home-made bread, and tea and —
O Heaven, were we awake or dreaming ? —Cake !
Then they filled our bags as full as they would hold
and we went on our way, leaving blessings behind
us, That night, as we sat before a blazing log in a
little green gully between two hills, and smoked
and yarned and felt at peace with all created
things, two horsemen rode up and asked us for a
pannikin of tea ; and, when they departed, they
left us a cake of tobacco about the size of a mile-
stone.
* » * *
We had been told that at a certain point, where
a great tree stood towering high over its fellows,
a blazed track began. We were to keep to this
track until we came to some other conspicuous
landmark—nature of which I have forgotten.
Then we were to branch off upon another track
and keep to that until a third striking feature in
the landscape arrested our attention. I forget
this feature also. This was a sign for us to take
yet another track, which would eventually lead us
to a homestead, at which we could make inquiries
for further tracks and features. We followed our
instructions exactly, as we thought. But when
you tramp to the top of one mountain to find a
higher mountain in front of you, and range beyond
range looming in the distance, and every mountain
and every range looks much alike, the results
are apt to be confusing. We met with many
mountains, many tall trees, many tracks which
all died away. Then we met many trackless
mountains, and at last, when we got to a mountain
that looked precisely like twenty-four previous
mountains, we had consumed the last of our pro-
visions. Fortunately we had tobacco. The time
was near when I would regret that I had never
learned to chew. Night fell, and we made a fire
and boiled the billy. We had tea, which was
another comfort. But we went to sleep feeling
very hungry. In the morning when we awoke the
mountains were all around—
Ohin on hand,
Like giants at a hunting lay.
But we thought of the old Scotch saying, “A
stoot hairt to a stae brae, ” and we faced them once
more. Once or twice during that long and dread-
ful day we came across something that looked like
a track, but when we followed it up it led nowhere.
The strain told first upon Bourke, probably be-
cause he was the biggest man, and had the greatest
burden of flesh and hair to carry. Moreover he
was the largest eater, and depriving him of his
breakfast meant depriving him of a great deal
more food than a smaller man would have lost
under like circumstances. As night fell again he
became taciturn and gloomy and lost all pride in
his beard. I slept soundly enough for the first
two or three hours, and when I awoke the others
seemed to be sleeping in a troubled, uneasy way.
Bourke was cursing somebody in his dreams. I
made-up the fire and went to sleep again. It took
a lot of trouble to worry me in those days. But
when the sun arose, and we saw the mountains
looking down upon us in silent scorn, and locking
us in. from the world of living men, we fully
realised for the first time that we were Lost.
Another day passed. Bourke by this time was
morose and sullen, and refused even to make re-
marks about his military career.
All at once we found ourselves standing above a
pleasant little green valley with a stream running
through it and—most delightful sight of all—-a
hut at the bend of the stream. We tumbled
rather than walked down the side of the hill. And
when we entered the hut it was empty and the
fireplace cold! The place had been, probably,
untenanted for years. We camped there all the
same, and I awoke early in the morning to find
Bourke sitting up and looking at us with a canni-
bal glare in the eyes. A cold shiver went through
me as I thought that I might be eaten by a British
officer in these solitudes, and I went out and tried
to kill a fish in the creek with a stone. I did not
succeed. Then I found a tree with congealed
gum in crevices of its bark. I ate some of the
gum, and was sorry afterwards. Subsequently
we saw a sheep and tried to catch it; but it was a
fast sheep, and left us far behind.
The day wore on, and at last we found ourselves
on a flat beside a great river. Faraway in the
distance what seemed to be smoke was rising.
“ There is a house there, or a camp anyhow,” I
said.
But Bourke was sour and unbelieving. He said
it was mist from the river, and throwing his swag
down, said he would go no further. He said he
preferred to die just there. Gaddy was more
hopeful. But I, who had said that the vapor in
the distance was real domestic smoke, felt in
honor bound to prove my assertion or fall in the
attempt. So I left Caddy to look after Bourke
in his last moments, and take any dying message
he had to give. And I pushed on.
It was real smoke—and it rose not from one
house, but from two. I went back and told .my
mates. Bourke put off dying for the occasion,
and that night I knew for the first time in.my life
that there is a pleasure to be found even in indi-
gestion.
D.
A Strike at The Golden Yell.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
The boss gazed at the typed sheet of the com-
pany’s note-paper that crackled in his fist. Then
he scowled like a walking Day of Judgment at the
approaching procession, and kicked his dog amid-
ships. “ Damn the Governor —and the directors
—and all Creation ! ”
Peters had just come up the shaft for a breeze.
“What’s up, Tom?” he queried, compassionately.
Matthews buzzed round. “What’s up! Every-
thing’s up ! Here’s the worm of a chairman
fetching the Governor and about 50 other claw-
hammered swells to inspect the show at half an-
hour’s notice — that’s what’s up ! Here’s the
poverty-stricken, Heaven-forsaken show all tails-
up with care, and that push of wasters coming to
crawl all over it.”
Peters eyed the impending array of visitors, and
blinked sadly fora minute. Then he got back to
the shaft and signalled for the “murderer.”
He got out at the 300 ft., wandered along the
drive into the underlay, and sang out to the
nearest toilers:
“Hey! you fellows! Get your hair brushed
an’ your dress-suits on ! Visitors ahead ! ”
A large man in a green-and-yellow shirt leaned
a 12-inch “ tom ” against the world, and gazed
at Peters tiredly. “Throttle all visitors,” he
said, in a foot-sore voice. Peters raked his head
with his fingers extra-thoughtfully.
“ Lessee,” he muttered in the quiet fastnesses of
an old winze. “Tom don’t want them pot-hatted
coots to get past the brace nohow. It ain’t the
show’s receivin’-day. Everythink’s in a mess,
and there ain’t been no carpets laid along the
drives for them howlers to walk on, nor nothink.
There oughter be a way o’ blockin’ them for him,
somehowruther. ”
Suddenly “’Ooray,” he shouted; “ ’Ooray !
there’s a strike on ! ”
He got out of the winze into the old drive,
where a score or more of practical geologists were
hard at work. “I say, you coves, Mr. Matthews
don’t want that buckram-shirted tribe to git below
the surface. He’s showin’ ’em around on protest
up on top now. Sling down your tools the whole
lot of yer, an’ up the shaft like lightning ! Say
you want another bob a shift. Say you want
creation, an’ the ventilation’s rotten, but say an’
do somethink ! Matthews ’ll love you for ever if
you do, an’ I’ll get him to split the difference and
make it a sprat—the rise, I mean.”
They were dumb for a minute, and Peters re-
addressed the man in the green and yellow shirt:
“Go on, Seymour; you take the lead an’ do the
spoutin’. Up the blow-hole with you ! ”
The shirt grinned loudly. “I’m your Moses!
Chuck away all them scientifik implemence, you
coves.”
The coves smiled; Peters nodded at them
gratefully, and then bounced off along drive and
crosscut to spread the glad tidings.
« * • •
Manager Matthews glanced wearily from the
clattering “30-head ” to the visitors. The chair-
man —a fat, sprawling stack of arrogant loquacity
—caught Matthews’ glittering eye, and thought
the light in it arose from gladness. “ Ah, yes,
Mr. Matthews, his Excellency will now go below.
You have everything all rights I presume?”
Matthews smiled,, with a struggle, then —
“ Hello ! what the ”
Seymour, in his W ;ird shirt, was standing by
the poppet-legs with a dozen other strange clayey
men. As Matthews spoke, up came the “delivery-
cart” with another contingent.
The manager eyed them dumbly for a second,
then his tongue slid into gear again.
“What boiled Hades game’s this? What
the devil are you doing up here? Your shift’s
not up! ”
Seymour gazed at him, a Niagara of a grin
streaming down his face.
“I know it ain’t, boss. It’s a strike. We
want you ter pay us a blanky bob a shift less, Mr.
Matthews. We all feel that you’re payin’ us too
much at present, sir, an’ the company’s gettin’
nearly old enough for a pension, an’ can’t afford
such wasteful expenditure.”
The chairman moved forward and waved his
paunch at Seymour in a dignified manner.
“You—you insolent dog ! Get off ! ”
Matthews, seeing the joke rising like a sweet,
dim star ahead, interrupted, as scores more of
dirty, mullock-marked geologists kept tumbling
up the shaft.
“Oh,” Matthews said, with intense gravity,
“you want a shilling rise, eh? Supposing you
get it under the ellr ? ”
Seymour smiled, and expectorated out across
the continent. “We’ll kick back, an’start on
him ! ” indicating the company’s chairman.
Mr. Colliber’s cheeks flamed red and his paunch
surged about like a ship at sea.
“Sack every man of them, Matthews,” he
thundered. “ Discharge every man jack of ’em.”
And the visit of inspection ended with this in-
dignant outburst.
■» * * *
Matthews stood in the Palace bar, a brandy-
and-soda in his hand, and gazed lovingly at
Peters. Peters had his hat on his eye and quoted
from the West Australian
The s’rike wish ’curred arr the Gold’n Yell mine las’
week, Whilst zexlncy the Gov’nor was payin’ the com-
p’ny’s proppery private visit, ’as—we un’stand—been
brought to a sarrisfac’ry ’elusion. All the men ’ave gone
back arr an increase sixpence shift. Mirr Matthews ”
Peters laughed hilariously and dropped the
paper heavily on the floor. “Nice li’l s’rike,
warn’ it, Tom ? ” he queried.

An interesting domestic story :
While the plague was rife in Sydney the servant of a
lodging-house keeper took mysteriously ill one morning.
Lodger No. 1 looked at her and ran upstairs to lodger
No. 2, who claimed medical knowledge. “ Oome down,
Dick!” cried he “and have a look at Jessie. I’m sure
she’s got the plague, and I kissed her only last night 1 ”
Dick investigated, and in turn sought the householder.
“ I say, Bill, you’d better look after Tom. The slavey’s
got the plague and he was kissing her last night.”
“ Great Scott! ” exclaimed the boss, “ then I’m in for it,
too ! I kissed her myself last night! ” Dick sniggered,
then suddenly grew grave. “ You weren’t kissing your
wife afterwards, I hope,” he said.
Decided by the magistrates at Millicent
(S.A.) that a man could not recover damages from
two others who had burned him in effigy opposite
his own shop-door, “the Court being unable to
see that he had sustained any damage. ”
At new London Hospital the operation-
rooms are so fitted that no speck of dust can get
in.—
The air supply is drawn from the garden by a glazed
tunnel. It is then driven by means of a large electric fan
through a canvas water screen and cotton-wool filters,
after which it passes into a heating chamber, and is
warmed by steam coils. Every operation takes place in a
kind of glass case, in which everything is sterilised.

In vain the white-armed women strove
To keep at home their seamen bold ;
They would not stay for lips of love,
They would not stay for lure of gold.
For they were of the roving brood,
Whose hearts may never anchored be—
But time the heaving of their blood
Unto the heaving of the sea.
And some were young, with sky-wide scope
Of vision, full of day-dreams rare ;
And some were old, and their last hope
Was pledged on this adventure fair.
The wind that bore them from the land
Died on the sea with heavy moan,
As one who, in the desert-sand,
Dies lost and friendless and alone.
The moon shone like a scimitar,
The banner of the sun. was furled ;
The ship was like a little star
Lost in a strange, green-water world.
Then rose a vessel on the sea,
With silver sails set falcon-wise.
Her captain cried, “ What men be ye
What is your port and merchandise ?
The captain of the ship spake free—
With cheeks afire and flashing eyes. ■
“ High hearts, and hopes, and dreams,” said he,
“ These be our only merchandise.
. “ The port to which we sail to-day,
And all days, lies below the West—
O captain, canst thou point the way
Unto the Islands of the Blest ? ”
The Corsair captain cried, “Depart 1
Follow thou still thy foolish star—
And yet an arrow in thy heart,
This hour, for thee were better far.”
The ship sailed over that strange sea— • -
The Wind of Joy her mainsail fills—
Down violet valleys of the sea,
O’er silver-plumed and flashing hills.
“ O captain, whither are we bound ? ”
A young man asked with eyes a-stare—
An old man said “ Wouldst thou be drowned,
O fool, on this adventure fair?”
Avose a splendid caravel
Upon the blue horizon’s rim,
Breast-heavy, with a milk-white swell,
And from her deck there rang a hymn.
And on her deck there stood a priest.
“ What port is yours ? ” the captain cried.
“ The Blessed Islands in the East,”
The tall, far-gazing priest replied.
The captain laughed ; the crew with smiles
Watched that vain ship upon its quest—
For well they knew the Blessed Isles
Were far and far within the West.

Big Bush Lies.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
“ The Lord sent them a strong delusion, and they
believed a lie. ” It is difficult in any other way to
account for the tales that are told of the Bush of
Australia. Begin where you will—the travelling
swagman for bedrock —and whenever people talk
about him they lie or repeat lies. Big John
O’Shanassy (Vic.) minted a long-lived lie with his
phraseaboutthem “walking about looking for work
and praying to God they may never find it.”
Governor Du Cane, of Tasmania, capped that
when he told a London audience that “on many
big Australian stations the cost of feeding travel-
lers was more than all the other expenses put
together.” “Loafing round the huts nine months
in the year and striking as soon as work comes
on ”is another big lie, authorship obscure. “ Take
up a bit of land and you’ll be independent
in five years ” has been very often said;
how often realised? “If you would only save
your money, you could be taking a trip home
instead of carrying that,” is a lie the agriculturist
has told the swagman thousands of times. “Get
the unemployed people on the land,” John See
says in N.S.W. to-day, as J. B. Patterson said in
Victoria years ago, and the one and the other, we
must suppose, under the same strong delusion.
The truth about all these things sounds just
about as strange to-day as did the tales Caroline
Chisholm told about the treatment female immi-
grants got in the bush 65 years ago. But still the
men who govern the country ought to face the
truth. How can public opinion (necessary pre-
cedent of satisfactory legislative action) be formed
on the pastoral-labor question while the delusion
holds ? Most of the authors of the classic lies are
dead, but the lies live on. What is the popular idea
of the swagman but a sordid sort of Satan going to
and fro in the land, devouring all he can and
doing nothing? The truth is, in the Eastern
States alone, there are from 30,000 to 50,000 swag-
men without whom squatting, as we know it,
could not be carried on—say 40,000 men, who do
not average three months’ work in the year each,
who cannot get more because there is no more for
them ; who, if liquor was knocked out of the land,
could not do more than keep themselves on the
plainest food and the most economical allowance of
tobacco ; who can never think of marrying; to
whom the word home has no practical significance.
Most of them drink the bulk of their earnings.
If they did not, it would be bad for the industry
with which they are associated. A sane and sober
man would hardly carry a swag the second year.
Every squatter and station-manager, clear of
delusion, must know, alt that. Yet who ever
heard a squatter speak of a swagman but as a
burden and a pest ? Governor Du Cane did but re-
Seat what he had been told in the bush. If he had
oubted and asked for evidence he certainly could
not have been furnished with proof that one station
to Australia ever spent £5OO in the year through
travellers’ rations. Think what it means. Allow
2d. for a pint of flour, 2d. more for tea and sugar,
and, to be liberal, another 2d. for meat. (Not
one station in fifty gives a ration of that sort.)
Then the cost per head is 6d., and it will take 40
every day in the year to total only £365. Is there
now, was there ever, a station in Australia
averaging 40 travellers a day throughout the
year? Half of that number would come nearer
the estimate of the biggest and most liberal, and
stations of that cut will require 100 rouseabouts
through their six weeks of shearing. In return
for rations given they have those men fit and
orderly and free of all cost at their hut doors
when wanted. What would it cost to bring them
out from town, and what would town men be
worth when brought out ?
- The farmer’s delusion is grosser than the squat-
ter’s. His harvest-work runs from three days to
three weeks. In the old hand-binding days, the
biggest chance he ever offered to a man to get “a
trip home ” was a shilling an hour, with tucker,
and that for three weeks at the longest. He does
not need much casual labor now, and a few hands
employed regularly may average £4O per year and
found. It takes a lot of years and a lot of saving
to make an independence, or even get a start, out
of that. And yet the air is thick with lies about
the farmers’ labor troubles and the fine field the
bush offers to deserving immigrants.
The politician’s lie about placing people in the
bush—planting them there by some means, and
according to some precedent never fully described
—does not merit much notice.. Nothing ever came
of it yet, and it has been tried in four States.
Nothing much has come out of it in the world:
The general order seems to be, amongst all pro-
gressive peoples, at least, that the cities snail
constantly be recruited from the country districts.
Our quidnuncs of the “sound economics” cult
would reverse all that. And they are the people
who, whether they believe them of not, pro-
mulgate the biggest bush lies of all. Theyjtell us,
bawl it at us unceasingly, that, on the bush alone,
do the cities and all citizens live. The bush is the
place where money is earned and made naturally.
They insinuate that Australian cities are warts on
the corpus of the bush, though they themselves
never get off the warts. Do they ever ask where
all the" money came from that has gone to
make the bush barely habitable, and, as an in-
vestment, one of the poorest outside Rhodesian
mines? Was the loan and mortgage money made
out of the bush or out of any so-called natural
(that is primary) industry in any land ? Is not all
the capital which goes into our bush-development
lent us by those whose revenues come mainly
from manufacturing and distributing the
raw materials we and other like nations pro-
duce ? The man in the Big Bush who grows or
digs may get enough to live meanly, and borrow
enough to carry on with anxiety. The fellow who
handles what is grown and digged will wear the
purple and fine linen always, and do the enter-
taining at home, and the pawnbroking abroad.
Poor old lied-about bushman! Master of the
sources. Lord of the springs of wealth ! Try the
searchlight on him, and he is sadly disappointing.
He knows —90 per cent, of bushmen know —that
the bush is a good place to get out of if any decent
chance offers. And the “sound economist’s”
bush —all-providing, all-supporting—is just about
as real as O’Shanassy’s pray-to-God swagman, or
Du Cane’s squatter, or the farmer’s hands, who, if
they looked after their earnings, might be all
going to the Coronation.
The truth of the matter, the facts of bush life, are
pretty well-known to men who are bred in it.
And what brings them by thousands every year
to every Australian city? Simply such convic-
tions as these. A trade, and regular work at that,
made at union wages, is worth more than the
average 640 acres of land available for selection
in any Australian State. So is a Sure billet at 7s.
a day, or a clerkship at £l5O a year. It is hard
reasoning on a cash basis, not silly hankering
after city life, that brings the young bushman to
town. Admitting their calculations to be right,
and they are easily figured-out, if one regular job
is worth 640 acres, a concern employing 3000
hands would be as good to the State as near
2,000,000 acres ; and one manufacturing city with
100,000 workers worth more than all the Crown
lands remaining in the biggest Australian State.
So our great primary-industry field dwindles
in value and prospect whenever we come to
consider it in comparison with other possibilities.
But we could treble the value of the golden fleece
if we resolutely took its manufacture into our own
hands. And why not? Because we are told
that our destiny is in the “natural industries ” of
the Bush. No other reason than that lie which,
as has already been said, caps all that is told of
the details of the life. When indeed the whole
business is dragged out into the light of common-
sense the old squatter apologists appear as
commonplace street-corner or post-and-rail liars,
while the “sound economists” show as Mun-
chausens.
F.M.
“ Melb.” : They are trying to divide this
city into Orange and Catholic factions. Infatu-
ation. The flank is turned. The bulk of the
population says “ A plague on both your houses ! ”
The poor old ostrich with its head stuck in the
sand ! Orangemen bottle themselves up by the
three thousand in Melb. Town Hall, and shout
“Great is Diana!” Then the Romans have a
similar bottling, and shout for some other Dinah.
Mayor Sam, who lets the hall to either, just about
represents the average public.
A military correspondent writes :
The real Commandant of the Commonwealth forces is
not General Hutton, but Joseph Chamberlain. Natur-
ally, the General would be prompted in every detail that
Could be imagined before he left England, but circum-
stances have arisen, that even the foresight of Chamber-
lain did not provide for, and decisions have had to be
delayed until the receipt of instructions from the genuine
Commandant. When Gen. Hutton assumed office in Mel-
bourne he apparently looked with a kindly eye upon the
rifle-clubs, and there seemed to be every prospect
that _ the excellent system that has prevailed
in Victoria would be adopted throughout Australia.
Then came a series of curious delays, and now just
enough of. the mask has been allowed to drop to indicate
that the rifle clubs will have no earthly chance of con-
tinuance under the old system. Gen. Hutton has let it
be known that he will have none of any such organisa-
tions which are not portion of the military forces and, as
such, under military discipline. In the old days the rifle
clubs of Vic. were amenable to military discipline. Then
they numbered some 2000 men; now they are ten times as
many. The. club-members’objection to being part of a mili-
tary force is plain. They desire the liberty of rifle-practice
at such times as they wish. They do not want drill or
uniforms or bumptious ornamental officers. If
they did, they could join one of the military corps.
But the rifle-club is for the man who desires to
be a good shot, without aspiring to military glory.
Gen. Hutton at first didn’t object to this. But the
local soldiery of the Commonwealth, thanks to Big.iohn
Forrest’s Defence Bill and Hutton’s administration,
exists, not for the-defence of Australia, but for England’s
purposes. The rifle-clubs (with 20,000 members in
Victoria alone), if they are not amenable to military
discipline, may, when the time comes, be Australian,
and not English. From a Chamberlain point of view,
that would be distinctly undesirable ; so the rifle clubs
must go.


Purifies the Blood
Busman Must Drink Bad Water. This Makes Bad Blood. Sickness
Follows. How to Make the Blood Pure.
Mr. Alexander Johnson, of Bourke,
New South Wales, sends us his photo-
graph and says:
“ For many years I have been en-
gaged in shepherding, stock-droving,
and other occupations so well known
to bushmen. Often the drinking-
water was very bad, and I was ex-
posed to other hardships of bush life.
I found all the men around me using
Ayer’s Sarsaparilla, so I triedit. For
cleansing and purifying my blood, and
for giving me new life and energy, I
found it the most wonderful medi-
cine I ever used. I do not see how
bushmen get along without it. I
advise all who read this to keep a
bottle of this grand medicine on hand
all the time, for it’s a great health
preserver.”
“The World's Greatest Family Medicine."
Perhaps you are not exposed to all the hardships of bush life. Yet you
have probably suffered from impure blood, great debility, nervousness, exhaus-
tion, indigestion, and other evidences of a weakened system. No matter what
your occupation, nor where you live, if you are in need of a blood-purifying
medicine and something to build up your nerves, you should certainly take
this grand family medicine.
You will make a great mistake if you try any other Sarsaparilla than
“Ayer’s.” This is the kind that has been making the cures for sixty years.
