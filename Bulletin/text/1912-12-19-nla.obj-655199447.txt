Dostoevsky
Fyodor Dostoevsky, one of the greatest of
modern Russian novelists, was born of poor
parents in 1821, and at his death in 1881
was acclaimed by the Russian people as a
king. He is still the most widely read of
Russian novelists, but his fame in England
is but beginning. He resigned his commis-
sion as sub-lieutenant in order to devote,
himself to literature. His first story, Poor
Folk, was hailed as a work of genius; but
fortune long delayed to knock at his door.
His contributions to a Russian magazine
were wretchedly paid for; and his connection
with a revolutionary society—a harmless,
non-political society—led to his arrest and
subsequent condemnation to death. With 21
others he was taken out to be shot. Writ-
ing to his brother, Dostoevsky says :
“They snapped swords over our heads, and
they made us put on the white shirts
worn by persons condemned to death.
Thereupon we were bound in threes to stakes,
to suffer execution. Being the third in the
row, I concluded I had only a few minutes
of life before me. I thought of you and
your dear ones, and I contrived to kiss the
two who were near me, and to bid them
farewell. Suddenly the troops beat a tattoo,
we were unbdund, brought back upon the
scaffold, and informed that his Majesty had
spared us our lives.”
One of the prisoners went mad as soon
as he was untied, and never regained his
sanity. The sentence was commuted to four
years’ in the Siberian mines and enforced
service in the ranks for life. But in 1857
Dostoevsky was recalled from exile. The
intense suffering of his experience upon the
scaffold, and the yeafs of misery he endured,
herded with the worst criminals, changed the
whole aspect of the novelist’s mind. He
suffered from violent attacks of epilepsy for
the rest of his life. He struggled to make a
living, but two journals which he started
were forbidden by the censorship. He was
weighed down with debt, his dead brother’s
family was dependent bn him; he was com-
pelled to write at heart-breaking speed; and
is said never to have corrected his work.
Ample confirmation to that statement is
given in his vast novel, The Brothers Kara-
mazov, published in 1881, and now trans-
lated by Constance Garnett, making the
first in the series of the novels of Dostoev-
sky, published by Heinemann. Closely,
printed, this tremendous work occupies over
800 pages.
For Dostoevsky has no idea of the prin-
ciple of selection ; he gets his wonderfully
intense effects solely by building up
laboriously, brick by brick, his tremendous
edifice. Whenever he introduces a new
character, and there are hundreds of; charac-
ters in this novel, he insists on your know-
ing all about him or her from birth. He goes
back to their youth, often to their fathers,
and paints an elaborate picture of charac-
ters that turn out, after all, to be merely
subsidiary to the main theme. And there
are whole sections, such as the history of a
Russian monk who dies early in the story,
and whose influence vanishes with his death,
which form small novels in themselves, use-
lessly clogging the action of the story. This
painting of characters with such meticulous
care, this all-envisaging eye of the writer,
this elaborate and detailed analysis of pys-
chological states, these minute realistic de-
scriptions of the most insignificant actions-
of his characters, succeed in the end in
endowing the reader with an extraordinary
insight into the minds of a whole Russian
community. You feel that Dostoevsky has
introduced you to Russia, and through him
you have made a life-long friendship with
a whole town-full of persons of remarkable
interest.
The story is, in essentials, a dramatic one,
the situation one almost impossible save in
Russia. The brothers Karamazov are the
thx-ee sons of an old sensual and drunken
buffoon. The eldest, Dmitri, was tire son of
his first wife, who committed suicide. The
other sons, Ivan and Alexey, were the off-
spring of the second wife, who died. There
was also another reputed son of this old
rascal, the daughter of an insane but harm-
less girl who died in giving birth to an epi-
leptic child. And the old drunkard of a
father had an easy way of getting rid of his
sons; he merely left them to the care of any
charitable person who happened along. Thus
each of the three legitimate sons was
brought up and educated in a different
fashion and by different persons. The
eldest, Dmitri, became an officer in the army;
the second, Ivan, was a student at the Uni-
versity and a brilliant writer of pamphlets;
the third, Alexey, became a monk, but dur-
ing the course of the story left the monas-
try, as apparently Russian monks may do.
The alleged illegitimate son, Smerdyakov,
was brought up in the household of the old
man as a dependent, and ultimately became
his master’s cook.
&
The three sons return to their old home
when they are young men, Dmitri, a reck-
less, passionate youth, demanding his share
of the old man’s jealously guarded money;
Ivan, the intellectual, watching in silence
the inevitable conflict between these two,
with the hope of snatching something for
himself from the pending fight; and Alexey,
the Christ-like monk, intent only on the
saving of the souls of all four. When an-
other factor is introduced to this atmo-
sphere of smouldering hatred, there is in-
stant flame. Dmitri is engaged to an heiress
named Katerina, but is in love with Gru-
sbenka, a woman of loose morals. His
father —here is the fuse lighted ready for
the explosion—is a rival with Dmitri for
this woman’s favors. Both are unsuccessful,
but the old sensualist’s infatuation for Gru-
shenka is so strong that he is ready to
marry her. And, a further complication,
Ivan is sincerely in love with Katerina,
Dmitri’s discarded fiancee. Only Alexey, the
saint-like younger brother, moves, untouched
by all this sensuality, through the conflict,
with forgiveness on his pale face. In the
distinct and contrasted chai-acters of the
three brothers it is evident that. Dostoevsky
means to indicate the three contradictory
aspects of that strange and half-oriental
thing, the Russian soul. There are, he
seems to imply, in every Russian some por-
tion of these three types: the sensual, the
intellectual, and the meek visionary. Or,
more probably, these three types make up the
Russian nation.
Slowly and deliberately the novelist lets
us see the growth of that insensate jealousy
of father and son, till the affair culminates
in the murder of the old man. Then Dostoev-
sky gives a Hansard-like report of the pre-
liminary investigation, with the psychology
of every actor, from the lawyers down to the
most insignificant witness, exhaustively ana-
lysed. Then follows the detailed, newspaper-
like report of the trial and its verdict, the
condemnation to Siberia of Dmitri. But
only just before the opening of the trial does
- the author let the reader know the real
murderer. Circumstantial evidence convicts
. Dmitri; but the murder was dohe by the
supposed illegitimate son, Smerdyakov, who
confesses proudly to the amazed Ivan that he
killed his master in obedience to the ex-
pressed desires of Ivan himself. Thus Ivan
knows himself the real, though unconscious,
murderer. The book closes with . the hint
that Dmitri will escape and go to America.
The characters of both women, Katerina and
Grushenka, are marvellously- depicted, the-
one the jealbus woman, the other a Magda-
lene purified by suffering. And there is a
subsidiary plot, dealing with Russian school-
boys which Dostoevsky allows in the closing
chapters to overshadow the main interest.
The death of a Russian lad and his funeral
achieves a height of pathos that has only
been equalled, but not surpassed, by Dost-
oevsky’s successoi’, Tolstoy.
<£*
Apparently when one Russian meets an-
other he immediately starts telling him all
about his mental processes, and the other
retaliates. And the Russian is vitally in-
terested in his religion. Either he is a
fervent believer, often a visionary and
mystic, or he as fervently refuses to
believe. Australians, in common with
the other European races, take their
religion without worry-; they tepidly be-
lieve, or they as tepidly don’t believe. Cer-
tainly we do not.find much pleasure in dis-
cussing religion. That is the Russian’s chief
delight, and, with drink, his chief preoccupa-
tion. Religion to the Russian is a vitally
beneficent thing, or an equally vitally malig-
nant thing. With us it is something that a
small minority of us hear spoken about in
specially apportioned buildings on one day
out of the seven. Every day in Holy Russia
is a holy day, and every tavern a church.
As one character says:—
“What have Russian boys been doing up
till now, some of them, I mean? In this
stinking tavern, for instance, here, they
meet and sit down in a corner. They’ve
never met in their lives before, and when
they go out of the tavern, they won’t meet
again for 40 yeax-s. And what do they talk
about in that momentary halt in the tavern?
Of the eternal questions, of the existence of
God and immortality. And those who do
not believe in God talk of Socialism or An-
archy, of the transformation of all humanity'
on a new pattern, so that it all comps' to
the same, they’re the same questions iiui-ned
inside out. And masses, massed of the most
original Russian boys do nothing but talk
of the eternal questions i” .
And, apparently, half Russia dreams, as
Dostoevsky and Tolstoy dream, of a millen-
nium when all the worl'd will be governed by
the ideals of Jesus. And Dostoevsky, anti-
cipating Tolstoy, teaches that in every, life,
however fallen and degraded, there comes an
ecstatic moment of self-devotion, a capacity
for acts of the most extraordinary purity and
moral courage. And the author fervently
believes that a soul can be saved only by the
purging ordeal of suffering.
All the Karamazovs are sensualists. Even
Alexey, the pure saint, is a son of his
father ; and Ivan, the intellectual, is unwit-
tingly the cause of his father’s murder. For
he knows that out of the crime he fore-
sees he will get Dmitri’s discai’ded heiress.
Dmitri, of course, with his splendid scoun-
drelism, is his father, too. But him it is
with whom tht** reader, in the end, has the
deepest sympathy.
Let us look at Gruslienka, the woman in
the case:—
It is true she was very, very good-looking,
with that Russian beauty so passionately
loved by so many men.... She had a full
figure, with soft, as it were, noiseless move-
ments, softened to a peculiar over-sweetness,
like her .voice. Her feet made absolutely no
sound on the floor. She sank softly into a
low chair, softly rustling her sumptuous
black silk dress, and delicately nestling her
milk-white neck and broad shoulders in a
costly black cashmere shawl. She was 22
years old, and her face looked exactly that
age. She was very white in the face, with
a pale pink tint on her cheeks. The model-
ling of her face might be said to be too
broad, and the lower jaw was set a trifle
forward. Her upper lip was thin, but the
slightly prominent lower lip was at least
twice as full, and looked pouting. But hex-
magnificent, abundant, dark-brown hair, her
sable-colol-ed eyebi-ows and charming, grey-
blue eyes, with their long lashes, would have
made the most indifferent person, meeting
her casually in a crowd in the street, stop at
the sight of her face and l-emember it long
after. What struck Alyosha most in that
face was its expression of child-like good
nature. There was a child-like look in her
eyes, a look of childish delight.... There was
something else which he could not under-
stand .... It was that softness, that volup-
tuousness of her bodily movements, that cat-
like noiselessness. Yet it was a vigorous,
ample body. Under the shawl could be seen
full, broad shouldei-s, a high, still quite
girlish bosom. Her figure suggested the
lines of the Venus of Milo, though already
in somewhat exaggerated proportions. That
could be divined. Connoisseurs of Russian
beauty could have foretold with certainty
that this fresh, still youthful, beauty would
lose its harmony by the age of 30, would
“spi-ead” ; that the face would become puffy,
and that wrinkles would very soon appear
upon her forehead and round the eyes ; the
complexion would grow coarse and red per-
haps—-in fact, that it was the beauty of the
moment, the fleeting beauty which is so
often met with in Russian women.
Every one of the principal characters is
afforded ample space to explain his soul:
the explanation of one’s soul seems to be the
chief duty of every Russian. The conversa-
tions are given in full, repetitions are inevit-
able, and the speeches seem almost inter-
minable. Ivan, for instance, is interested
almost solely in his religious beliefs, or lack
of belief. An attack of “brain fever” allows
him to have a delightful interview with the
devil, described with many realistic and
homely touches. And with his monkish bro-
ther he expounds himself tirelessly. Con-
cluding his tremendous monologue to Aly-
osha (Alexey), he says:-
“And so I hasten to give back my en-
trance ticket, and if I am an honest man I
am bound to give it back as soon as pos-
sible. It’s not God that I don’t accept,
Alyosha, only I most respectfully return
Him the ticket.”
“That’s rebellion,” murmured Alyosha.
“Rebellion? lam sorry you call it that,”
said Ivan earnestly. “One can hardly live
in rebellion, and I want to live. Tell me
yourself, I challenge you —answer. Imagine
that you are creating a fabric of human
destiny, with the object of making men
happy in the end, giving them peace and
rest at last, but that it was essential and
inevitable to torture to death only one tiny
creature —that baby beating its bi-east with
its fist, for instance--and to found that edi-
fice on its unavenged tears, would you con-
sent to be the architect on those condi-
tions?”
“No, I wouldn’t consent,” said Alyosha,
softly.
And the teaching of the sainted elder in
the monastery is a masterly exposition of
the mystic soul of the Russian. Here is
one of his Tolstoyan dicta: —
“Remember particularly that you cannot
be a judge of anyone* For no one can
judge a criminal, unless he recognises that
he is just such a criminal as the man stand-
ing before him, and that he perhaps is more
than all men to blame for that crime. If I
..had' been . righteous myself, perhaps .there
would have been no criminal standing before
me. If you can take upon yourself the
crime of the criminal your heart is judging,
take it at once, suffer for him yourself, and
let him go Without reproach. And even if
the law itself makes you his judge, act in
the same spirit as far as possible, for he
will go away and condemn himself more bit-
terly than you have done. If, after your
kiss, he goes away untouched, mocking at
you, do not let that be a stumbling-block
to you. It shows his time has not yet
come, but it will come in due course. And if
it come not, no matter; if not he, then an-
other in bis place will understand and suf-
fer, and judge and condemn himself, and
the truth will be fulfilled.”
But this huge book is not to be sampled
by quotation. _ There is too much in it.
lhere is, for instance, the account of the
death of a monk who was reputed to be a
saint. Not only does the author tell you all
a . I hlSt ,° l ' y ’ but gives you all his teachings.
And when all the monastery and all the
neighborhood were eagerly expecting the
miracles that would surely happen on his
death, a strange thing does happen, but
hardly a miracle. For the body of this
withered-up old man decomposes prema-
turely. In Dostoevsky’s plain phrase, it
stinks! Now, there was a legend that the
dead bodies of saints did not show any signs
of death. The monks, sure of the sanctity of
their dead elder, had not even opened the
window of the cell where the body lay. And
that smell drives Alexey from the monastery
—into life.
And the speeches of the opposing lawyers
at the trial are of the most subtle psycho-
logical texture: they are given unabridged.
And the course of the trial the reader fol-
lows with all the eager interest of a reader
of defective stories, so keenly does the author
keep you on the alert for the denouement.
Then there are an extraordinary analysis of
an hysterical young girl; the strange soul of
the epileptic murderer, Smerdyakov; the
conflicting passions of Dmitri; the intellec-
tual doubts of Ivan; the frankly Rabelasian
sensualities of the father, mixed with a curi-
ously naive affection for his sons; the series
of exposure of abnormal soul-states of Rus-
sian childhood. And there is the exciting
interest of the story itself. But Dostoevsky’s
chief “note” in this extraordinary, inchoate
fragment of realism, rough-hexyn and un-
finished, is his power and intensity. His
command of pathos is a revelation. from a
literature that to English eyes is itself a
revelation.
The One-Act Australian Play
A number of one-act plays have been re-
ceived for the competition lately announced
on this page, the winner to get tAo guineas
as author’s fees, the three repertory organ-
isations in Australia having promised favor-
ably to consider the winning playlet fox-
production. Since the competition was an-
nounced, in response to the request of sev-
eral correspondents, the directors of the
commercial theatrical firms in Australia have
been approached with a view to the profes-
sional pi*oduction of Australian plays. The
request was coupled with an offer to let the
representatives of the commercial theatre
themselves select the plays, the *‘Red Page”
offering to call for and collect the sci'ipts:
but this aspect of the question was not
touched upon in the courteous replies
recieved fi-om the managers of all the theat-
rical firms or companies in the Common-
wealth. The general tone of the replies was
wholly favorable to the suggestion that
an annual matinee should be given by_ pro-
fessional actors, at which three selected Aus-
tralian plays should be tried out; but it is
too soon yet to discuss the details or the
proportioning of the cost. When this con-
test closes —it will close at the end of this
year—the matter will be fully gone into;
and, whatever happens, the winner will
probably have his play produced by one or
more of the Repertory organisations, with
the possibility of professional production.

“Austral,” the pen-name of a well-known
inter-State lawn tennis representative, uses
his fund of expert knowledge of the game in
Lawn Tennis in Australia (Edwards, Dun-
lop, Sydney). The feature of this valuable
work —a comprehensive survey of the game
in Australasia —is the number of action
photographs of every Davis Cup and Aus-
tralian “crack,” taken in actual play, and
not posed. The evidence of the camera is
invaluable for the understanding of grips,
strokes, action and footwork; and though
the photographs are not always sharp, they
are always elucidative. “Austral” writes of
the modern game without much literary art,
but with a practical ability to instruct. His
criticisms of well-known players are always
acute. In addition, there are articles on
the Davis Cup contests, Australasian tennis
history, practical advice in the making oh
courts, and a full list of all important
matches and records. A timely and valu-
able book for the tennis-player.
Pleasant prose, masquerading in the doub-
let and hose of verse, is all that is to be
found in The River and Other Verses, by
E. C. Morrice (Aust. Authors’ Agency.
Melb., Is.). The author prattles easily of
the bunyip, of the charm of the bush, of the
Southern Gross, of “Mailboy Jim’s Ride,” of
“The Drov&r’s Christmas Eve,” and other
innocuous aild conventional subjects, and
contrives to say of each the innocuous and
conventional thing. It appears from the
author’s acknowledgment that her verses
have appeared in Mail, Town and
Country Journal, Sydney Herald, Goul-
burn Herald, WGLLONHILly Press, and
Band of Mercy Advocate.

The following 1 letters were sent
to us out of gratitude for the new
life and renewed health these
ladies have actually experienced
by the use of “ Wincarnis.”
Condemned to be life-long
Invalid.
Restored to Health by
“ Wincarnis. •’
Mrs. SABAH DE VILLE, Burton-
on-Trent, writes:—
Dear Sirs, —A few months ago
I was so dangerously ill that the
doctors said they could do nothing
more for me, and advised me to
make the best I could of life, as I
should never be well again. I was
terribly upset at the prospect of
being a life-long invalid, and when
a friend of mine urged me to try
“Wincarnis,” I applied to you for
one of your free trial bottles. I was
astonished and delighted to find that
from the first glassful your “Win-
carriis” put new life into me. I perse-
vered with “Wincarnis,” and before
long I was able to get about again.
Instead of remaining a life-long in-
valid, I was now able to carry on
business, and I owe all my renewed
health and strength entirely to your
wonderful “Wincarnis.”
Yours very gratefully,
SARAH DE VILLE.
So weak, could hardly walk.
“ Wincarnis ” gave new life.
52 Nightingale Road, Dover.
Dear Sirs, —I feel in duty bound
to write and thank you for the won-
derful benefit I have derived from
your splendid “Wincarnis.” For
months I have been depressed and
nervous, and so weak that I could
hardly walk, and felt I wanted to
be always sitting or lying down.
But your “Wincarnis” has put New
Life into me. I can now go about
my work with a new vigor, that
makes my household duties a pleas-
ure, instead of a burden as before.
I cannot properly express my grati-
tude fpr the grand health your life-
giving “Wincarnis” has given me.
It is splendid to feel so strong and
well. I have told all my neighbors
about your wonderful “Wincarnis,”
and I feel I want to tell the whole
world what a splendid tonic and re-
storative it is.
Yours very gratefully,
(Mrs.) C. B. BARNATT.
The Inky Way.
Our esteemed contemporary, King-Bao, has been
suppressed by the bosses of the Chinese Republic.
Founded in a.d. 400, King-Bao was probably the
oldest -newspaper, in the world. It was originally
printed on 10 yellow silk pages, which were bouncl
together like a book. The job of editing the rag was
often most unhealthy. During the eighth century,
owing to some disrespectful remarks made concern-
ing Fin-Mo-Ling, a royal quong of considerable ton-
nage, the editor was charged with unprofessional
conduct, and was sentenced to various tortures and
death at the stake, the sentences to be cumulative.
Away back in the twelfth century King-Bao pub-
lished an article demanding that the Government
should turn its back on tradition, give ceremony the
go-by, and “send clever men to Europe to learn
there.” The local Tories were shocked, and the
editor, the poet Gur-Nu-Tschang, was decapitated.
Also, his head with the ears torn off and the tongue
plucked out was exhibited as a gentle hint to the
Inky Way that that sort of talk wasn’t quite the
thing.

he was liberated quietly when Smith died.’ Supple
was a leader-writer, employed sometimes by Syme
with whom Smith had great influence. He had pre-
viously been Age editor. Supple fancied that Smith
blocked his contributions, hence the shot. This Smith
became Attorney-General in a McCulloch Ministry
He was a very able man—first a Bendigo draper, after
that Arcus liiw reporter. Then, going to Syme, he
got the creidt of all the slaughterous writing in the
Age though the most bloodthirsty of it was done by
H. J. Smith, who had been a Dunolly baker. This
H. J. Smith went from the Age sub-editorship to lead
the Argus reporting staff, following Charles Bright
who was turned on to smash spiritualism, but became
spiritualist lecturer.

. The National Union of Journalists has
been holding its annual dinner at the Hotel Cecil
London. Membership is restricted to working iour-
nadists, of whom 3600 are on the roll. Lord North-
cliffe, proprietor of the Daily Mail and head of the
house of Harmsworth, sent a letter of benediction.
He had watched the growth of the union with the
greatest interest —had seen “our craft,” from a
humble, haphazard and badly-paid occupation, raise
itself to the dignity of a profession, offering con-
stantly-mcreitsmg opportunities to men and women
of ability. Newspaper work was less arduous nowa-
days than when he was a reporter, owing to the in-
troduction of time-saving machinery, but it was
more nerve-exhausting; therefore, journalists should
demand longer annual holidays and better pay. Inciden-
tally. he did not think it wise or politic that news-
paper proprietors and working journalists should
belong to the same society, yet they should co-
operate when necessary to uphold the dignity of the
Fourth Estate, “as on the recent occasion when the
staff of the Sydney Daily Telegraph was expelled
from the N.S.W. Legislative Assembly.” Lloyd
George, Chancellor of the Exchequer, who was the
Principal guest of the evening, confessed that he had
dabbled a little in journalism himself. During his
early years in Parliament he had “earned an honest
if somewhat precarious livelihood” by writing a
sketch of each day’s proceedings for a paper whose
name he didn’t mention. At first he found difficulty
m collecting material to make up the column, but
he gradually “learned the portentousness of little
things in Parliamentary life.” Ever since that
struggle he had had a sneaking sympathy with jour-
nalists in search of copy, and they were always wel-
come to get as much out of him as they could.
Bennett Burleigh, the veteran war correspondent
of London D.T. at the Balkan upheaval, is said to
be the only journalist alive who went through the
Russo-Turkith war in 1877. At that time British
sympathy was, of course, with the bird that is now
being carved, and it was largely due to Burleigh’s
heroics of the defence of Plevna and other noted
unpleasantnesses that the Turk got such a boom as
a fighting man. Under the thrusts of the Bulgar
that bubble looks- as though it might burst.
THE BATTLE PENCIL.
[FOR THE BULLEITN.]
A strict censorship is being exercised over all mes-
sages from the seat of war. —News item.
Wild war arose with blood and fire,
The foemen stabbed and burned and died,
And trembling down the far-stretched wire
The news came flying o’er the tide —
The news that told from day to day
That there was nothing new to say.
Around the city cannon roared,
And someone lost and someone won,
But still the message sent ignored
The thing that really had been done,
And editors in stark despair
. Tore their long fingers through their hair.
Yet evermore the teeming press
Poured out its tale of strife and woe,
And dished up in a ready dress
The viands inky gardens grow—
Fierce hash of battle steaming hot,
0 Seasoned with shrapnel, smoke and shot.
The public in the crowded street
Paid copper coinage large and fair
To read upon the evening sheet
Of States and armies past repair,
And how heroic legions fell
On countless foes and gave them h —ll.
The censor with his pencil blue
And large, strong scissors sharp and bright,
Waged war on everything in view
That correspondents tried to write,
And merely let the plain word stay—
“ There was some fighting yesterday.”
But in their office far apart,
With pens for guns and ink for fire,
The warrior scribes arranged with art
A tale to match the day’s desire,
And battles, sieges, death and flame
Were commonplaces of the game.
They chased an army round the map,
Arranged an armistice at will,
Or fixed an ambush meet to trap -
The public to its evening thrill. ...
And all the time with pencil blue
The censor scored the plain truth through.

VARIOUS VERSE
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
A Dream of Bliss.
I do not think the moon was quite
As straight as she might be;
She leaned a little to the right,
And seemed to wink at me
Because two eyes were strangely bright
Between me and the sea.
Two laughing eyes, a wisp of hair,
A saucy hat askew,
A hint of summer in the air,
A dainty girl in blue,
I wanted both her lips to wear
On my enchanted two.
It may be rash to seize a kiss
As thirst ensnares a beer,
But rasher surely ’twere to miss
A joy so warm and near;
And this especial piece of bliss
\yas pink, and slim, and dear.
I do not know from whence she came,
Or whither I was bound,
The little wavelets spake no blame,
For all their lisping sound ;
And though I did not know her name
I knew her waist was round.
Somewhere within the pleasant niglT
We sat beneath a tree,
And five small fingers rosy white
Were yielded up to me;
Five separate joys as soft and light
As fish fins in the sea.
I do not know that what we said
Was worth the writing down;
Across the bay a light was red,
And some large shadows brown
Slept where the harbor ferries tread
The broad, wet way to town.
I thought her sweeter than a pearl,
And warmer than a star;
She made my heart-wheels spin and whirl
Much faster than a car;
I loved her better than the girl
In Casey’s private bar.
She said: “The night is very still,
And I should like to float
Beyond the lighthouse on the hill
To places far l'emote
Where our new joy might learn to fill
The whole of one small boat.”
The boat was rocking on the sea
Just as she said the word;
I called it and it came to me
As lightly as a bird
This is the point where you’ll agree
My story is absurd.
We sailed right out beyond the Heads
Where wide weed-curtains close
Above small mermaids in their beds,
Asleep in dreaming rows,
With counterpanes of water spread
Over their pale, pink toes.
And as we got beyond the world
The clocks in town struck seven;
The mists of morn were lightly curled
About the roofs of Heaven
(A place where sober folk are hurled
To Tophet at eleven).
We went ashore. Oh, it was good
To tread the pearly grey
Of streets where laughing angels stood,
All pinioned like the day, ,
With trays of gold and sandalwood
To bear my sins away.
My empty crimes they carried out
And bore the full ones in;
And none was there who scorned to shout
Me draughts of Heavenly sin—
And when the girl began to pout
I kissed her on the chin.
And all day long, and all the night
We had a holy time,
For no one ever got too tight
Or sober in that clime;
It was a place of calm delight,
Occult, remote, sublime.
We left the wharf with sigh and sob,
And words of vain regret,
A kind saint parted up a bob
To buy a final wet;
I knew that I should lose my job
Unless I went... .And yet.. . .

They crushed a star to light her eyes,

They could not find for her a soul.

The Spinner.
I spun a thread of gold
On the turning wheel of desire,
I knew that my hand could hold
A flame of the olden fire.
“Lo, this is life,” I sang,
“And the end of the thread shall be
As the first young song that rang
To the oldest melody.”
The red flame scorched my hand,
But ■-my heart was singing still,
“I am spinning a shining strand
That shall bind the great world’s will.”
The fierce flame scorched my heart,
But never a pause I made;
“The thing that I spin is part
Of a wonder that cannot fade.”
The wild flame scorched my soul,
But I sang to the flying wheel,
“Oh, glad are the hands that stole
What the young gods could not steal!”
I spun a thread of gold
From a fleece of shining fire,
Till the bobbin reel was cold
On the wheel of dead desire.

How to Address Letters.
Correspondents to The Bulletin would oblige the
paper (and, to an extent, themselves) by taking
some care as to methods of address.
ISusiness letters (with regard to subscriptions, ad-
vertisements, etc.) should in no case be addressed to
the Editor, but to the Manager. To send them to
the Editor is to invite inattention.
It is not a good thing to address editorial letters
to anyone by name. “The Editor, The Bulletin,” is
the proper superscription for “copy.” Delay, and
even loss, is sometimes caused by addressing to ver-
sons instead of officials. The person may not be
there; the official always is.

TWO YEARS’ HARD ’BUS-MISSING.
The close of the session of the N. S. Wales
Parliament found the McGowen Govern-
ment obscenely disintegrating before the
very eyes of the people, A multitude of un-
savory charges floated about its head; its
feet were dogged by battalions of burst pro-
mises ; and a pillar of fear haunted it day
and night. In a couple of dozen brief
months it had fallen from its high position
as the Great White Hope of the community
to the lowly status of a public misfortune
and a tragic joke. When the unique advan-
tages with which it started on its legislative
career are taken into consideration, its com-
prehensive failure to make good is some-
thing approaching a record. In many re-
spects the downfall is entitled to take rank
with Sedan, the Dreadnought agitation,
the capitulation of Carthage. Freetrade and
similar stupendous calamities.
* * * *
Fully to appreciate the magnitude of the
Government’s failure it is well to consider
in the first place the circumstances under
which it took office. It succeeded about the
most futile Ministry N. S. Wales had known.
The party which it ousted did not contain
one man of first-rate ability or anything ap-
proaching thereto. In the lower ranks was
a herd of political deadbeats —worse than
useless encumbrances, the products of the
machine selection system. It stood, as it
still does, for anti-Australianism, the foster-
ing of inter-State jealousy, the borrowing
mania, sectarianism, a particularly snuffle-
busting form of and a variety
of other unpleasantnesses, all of which had
gone utterly out of favor. In two respects
at least its policy was antipathetic to the
more thoughtful and progressive-minded of
its own followers. The Wade Closer Settle-
ment system, under which estates were
bought wholesale at ridiculously high
figures and sold retail at still more ridicu-
lous prices to embryo bankrupts, was
among the by-words of the backblocks. For
obvious reasons the party leaders were un-
able to accept the principle of a progressive
land-tax—the one effective means of open-
ing up desirable country for farming pur-
poses. In the jargon of the Tory who mas-
querades locally as a Liberal, such measures
amount to confiscation and robbery. So
Liberalism in N. S. Wales found itself com-
mitted indefinitely to locked-up estates,
wilting townships, city congestion and 'all
the evils that march therewith. At a time
when fish, fruit, meat, bread and a dozen
other purely State rings were briskly hoist-
ing the cost of living, secure (under the
fegis of successive High Court judgments)
from the attentions of the Australian Par-
liament, the Wade party announced itself,
in effect, as the friend of every class of
trust. There were tragic asses who en-
gineered the wire-netting steal, and at-
tempted to dower their leader with the
credit of a deed of heroism in which he had
had no share whatever; but even these could
hardly have regarded the friendship towards
the Trusts as good electioneering business.
In that event it is explicable only on the
grounds that the combines, having paid the
piper, claimed the right to call the Liberal
tune. For these and other sound reasons
N. S. Wales was ready for a change—any
old change—of Government. In fact, it would
not be over-stating the case to say that it
was aching for one. So Labor entered on
what looked like a fair inheritance; and its
friends assured each other exultantly that,
after years of comfortless wandering in the
desert, James Moses McGowen and his
associates would soon show how good was
the Promised Land, and how wisely and well
the democrats were capable of running it.
•£' * * *
The earnest Labor supporter who was also
a man of discernment had about three
months’ run for his enthusiasm, and then his
large,. honest, trusting jaw began to drop.
He found that nothing whatever was hap-
pening according to specifications. A plank
which has stood in the forefront of the party
platform for years and years deals with the
abolition of the office of State Governor and
the wiping-out of the Legislative Council —
two reforms which, especially since Federa-
tion arrived, are advocated by many an anti-
Laborite. The State Governor —what with
his salary, the rent-free residences that are
given him, his free railway passes and so
on —costs the State every farthing of £lO,OOO
per annum. Since the creation of the office
of Governor-General he has ceased to have
any signification as a strand in the silken
tie of Empire. It has been proved repeat-
edly that there is no job which he is in the
habit of undertaking that couldn’t be as well
or better performed by the State Chief Jus-
tice. Yet the McGowen Government did
nothing to remove the existing vice-regal
superfluity; and one of its last administra-
tive acts, prior to the close of the session,
was to approve the appointment of his suc-
cessor, without one word of protest. The
Legislative Council was not abolished either.
On the contrary, it was “strengthened” by
the creation of a number of new members —
members who evidenced their gratitude by
helping to throw out or mutilate Govern-
ment measures. The McGowen Ministers
came into power as exponents of the doc-
trine of honest finance. In the course of
two years they have borrowed in the neigh-
borhood of 10,000,000 sterling, in addition to
spending the Wade surplus and the boom
revenue which the State has enjoyed. Inci-
dentally, they have tried to borrow more, and
failed. And, throughout, the Labor party’s
policy of a sinking fund obligation attached
to every loan was jettisoned. They took
credit, during the last election campaign, for
being broad-visioned folk with no particular
predilections in favor of Sydney vested in-
terests. Yet their efforts in the direction of
decentralisation amount to nothing worth
talking about, as a result of which the closed
ports remain shut and the hinterlands con-
tinue to be handicapped as regards trade
outlets and inlets, while a growing popula-
tion and a vigorous immigration movement
have combined to bloat the harbor city more
than at any time in its history. There is
good reason to think that several of the
measures about which the Government
crowed loudest were not intended to crnne
to anything from the start —the Income Tax
Bill, for example, which penalised local in-
dustries while exempting from serious assault
the absentee landlord, who is one of Aus-
tralia’s leading curses; and the Gas Bill,
which, having been handled by a Minister
who was palpably unacquainted with its in-
tricacies, speedily hit the rocks. As regards
the paltry and unpatriotic business of haras-
sing the Australian Government at every
turn, the allegedly democratic McGowen
Administration has gone as far as, any Gee-
bung Government. The seizing of Federal
Government House as a lesson to the Fisher
Ministry for its disinclination to pay what
amounted to blackmail, was altogether
worthy of the Carruthers Government,
from 'which the “eviction” proposal origin-
ally emanated. So far as the Referendum
questions are concerned, the Ministry has
been equally unsatisfactory. Those members
who are not State-righters are warily laying
low and saying nothing. Yet on an affir-
mative answer to these Referendum ques-
tions depends the future of the democratic
movement in Australia. Nothing but the
passage of amendments relating to trade and
commerce, corporations, industrial disputes,
and trusts and combinations is going to free
the Commonwealth from the monopoly curse
which flourishes so rankly in every Federa-
tion. McGowen’s Ministers must know
that; but they say, in so many words, that
the trust curse is preferable to a constitutional
change which threatens State Rights. In
brief, the Labor Government of N. S. Wales
is Tory in most of the things that matter,
and in many respects it isn’t even an honest
Tory.
A study of the lamentable position into
which the first N. S. Wales Labor Adminis-
tration has got itself —the result, chiefly, of
its senseless attempts to win the regard of
those who always have detested and distrusted
it, and always will —suggests that there
is a truly glittering future in front of the
party which decides to pay no more atten-
tion to the instructions of the Conservative
press and the calico interests of Sydney than
to the yapping of so many tripe-hounds. Such
an Administration will no more think of
bringing the State to the financial situation
of having nothing save a series of good
seasons between it and repudiation, than a
reputable private citizen would think of run-
ning frantically into debt, and then calling
upon his grandchildren to settle his heroic
obligations. It will not be open to the
charge of being a purely Sydney party. Re-
gardless of the exasperated shouts of im-
porterdom and so forth, it will ‘ proceed
energetically to found new Sydneys on sites
like Jervis Bay and Port Stephens. If
through the ill-fortune of strife, its majority
disappears, this Ministry will nfot hang on
to office like a famished animal adhering to
a bone. It will go serenely into obscurity,
and trust to its achievements to put it in the
limelight again. Above everything it will be
Australian all the time. The States Rights
cry has been dead as a political asset for
years, though the caution shown by the
people in the matter of the Referenda voting
(a caution which is observable wherever the
Referendum system obtains), has recently
done something to give it an appearance of
vitality. There is not the least doubt that
the vast bulk of the electors want the New
Protection, Commonwealth control of mono-
polies and the other reforms which the
Fisher Government is seeking to effectuate,
though a vague fear of something
dreadful about to happen, as a re-
sult of handing over to the Aus-
tralian Parliament the powers which the
British Parliament has held for centuries,
oppresses those of them whose views are
formed or powerfully influenced by the Lib-
eral daily papers. The State Ministry which
is disinterested and patriotic enough to lay
itself out to dissipate those misgivings wiil
gain tremendous nudos all over Australia.
And in a little while it will gain support—
the support not only of Labor Unionists, but
of the Nationalists, a rapidly growing body
of electors who are nauseated in a fairly
equal degree with the imposture of State
“Liberalism” and the humbug of State
“Labor.”
WHEN THE FOGHORN BLOWS.
[FOR THE BULLEITN.]
Shortly after midnight the air becomes
clammy. The wind falls away to a dead
calm, with occasional light, moist puffs.
Wraith-like vapors bend themselves about
the ship, only to disperse a minute or two
later. The second officer, who has the
watch, having in mind the instructions writ-
ten by the captain in the Night Order Book,
“Call me at once if it sets in thick,” ner-
vously fingers the mouthpiece of the speak-
ing-tube to the captain’s room, uncertain
whether it is bad enough to turn out the
“old man.” He decides to wait a little. By
the time the skipper has got on to the bridge
it may have cleared away, and he doesn’t
want to be thought lacking in nerve.
The clear intervals between the patches
of fog grow less frequent; the patches them-
selves lengthen in inverse ratio. Then the
fog shuts down altogether.
The second casts his eye up to the mast-
head light and sees it blazing out on the
surrounding fog. He decides that he had
better “roust” out the “old man,” after all.
* * * *
In his room under the bridge, the cap-
tain, who has only turned in an hour pre-
viously, is sleeping the calm sleep of the
satisfied skipper. He is in the midst of that
delightful dream that comes occasionally to
merchant service captains when they are in
a contented frame of inind. This, by the
way, is rare. He is dreaming he has picked
up a large passenger steamer that has lost
its propeller, and is in imminent danger of
becoming a total loss. Being filled to the
hatches with a costly cargo, it is a very
valuable salvage prize. He has successfully
carried out a difficult and dangerous piece
of work, and has been able to retire to a
farm on his share of the salvage money. He
is the Popular Hero of the Moment, and is
just being presented with a pair of inferior
binoculars by the president of the Board of
Trade, in recognition of his services. Sud-
denly the president of the Board of Trade
changes into a malignant monster, which
springs on him, uttering piercing shrieks.
He awakes with a start to find the tube
over his head whistling shrilly. He un-
hooks it savagely. “What is it?” he asks.
A muffled voice comes down the tube.
“Getting pretty thick up here, sir.”
“All right,” he grunts, “I’ll be up in a
minute.”
He rolls out of his bunk, and throwing a
heavy bridge-coat over his pyjamas, mounts
the bridge ladder. He casts a rapid glance
around and overhead. “Been like this long?”
lie snaps. “About a quarter of an hour
since the last clear spell, sir,” answers the
second.
“Put the telegraph at ‘Stand By,’ and
keep the whistle going” ; and the “old man”
g»oes down to get into some warm clothes,
cursing his luck, for he has had a tiring day,
and knows that he is probably in for a night
on the bridge.
When he comes up again, the fog is per-
ceptibly denser. From either side of the
lower bridge the sidelights throw out dia-
phanous screens of green and red. Around
each masthead light is a pale golden aureole,
while the rays, streaming out from the
saloon and stateroom ports, are projected
against the fog like miniature searchlights.
“Buzz-z-z-z-z-z!” Every two minutes the
whistle booms out a deep hoarse roar, the
sound, curiously deadened by the fog, coming
back straight on to the ears. Overhead,
glistening in the rays thrown out from the
main masthead light, the rigging and stays
are hung with heavy beads of moisture,
which fall in large pattering drops. The fog
draws in closer still, until the after-end of
the ship becomes a mere blur, through which
the electric deck-lights gleam dimly, whilst
the forepart of the ship merges itself into
the general opaqueness. Forward of the
bridge all deck-lights have been switched off,
so that no glare may interrupt the view
over the bows. On the bridge the only illu-
mination is fr'om the binnacle, which throws
into sharp relief the features of the quarter-
master at the wheel, as he gazes steadily at
the compass card. Magnified by the fog,
every object in sight assumes a distorted
and unreal appearance, as, fold after fold,
the interminable drive of the main body of
fog rolls over the water. It is fairly low-
lying, and occasional glimpses are seen of
the stars through the drifting wreaths.
“Half-speed,” orders the captain. Fol--
lows a deep jangling of bells down in the
engine room; then a shriller jingling from
the bridge telegraph as .tha- order is an-
swered ; and the vibrations of the ship alter
their time. The wash from the bows be-
comes quieter as the ship loses some of its
way. They have been doing 15, and have
now slowed to about nine.
The second hails the look-out man on the
forecastle head: “Keep your ears open for
any whistles ahead.”
“Aye ! Aye ! sir.”
Small good to rely on the eyes in a fog
like this, for one can scarce see 20 yards
into it. Might as well try to see through a
whitewashed wall. Up on the bridge the
skipper stands in one wing, the watch officer
in the other, both craning themselves out
over the forepart, and straining their 'eyes
into the obscurity forward. This is sheer
habit, for they know full well that from their
hearing alone is safety to be had.
Presently the strain on the optic nerve be-
gins to tell. Lights appear ahead in the fog
where there are no lights, and shadowy
masses conjured up by the brain loom threat-
eningly over the bows. All imagination, of
course. Nothing is there. These are clear
waters. Not much chance of meeting any
vessels here; and, anyway, we’d hear their
whistles if we did. Might as well plug on at
full speed again—only losing time as it is.
The idea is forming itself in the skipper’s
mind, then —
“Buzz-z-z-z-z-z-z !”
From dead ahead of us comes the deep
diapason of a large steamer’s whistle. It
sounds a long way off, but one of the vagar-
ies of a fog is that you can never tell how
far away a sound is by its volume. Neither
can you depend entirely on its apparent
direction.
“Whistle right ahead, sir,” says the
second.
“I hear it,” answers the skipper. “Ring
‘Stop!’ and keep that whistle going.”
* * * *
Awakened by the change of speed, the
chief engineer has gone down to the engine-
room to see why she is slowed down. He is
grumbling about it to the third, who has the
middle watch. The chief is anxious about
his “average speed.”
“What the Gehenna (or words to that
effect) is the old blighter slowing down for?”
he inquires angrily.
“Sugared if I know,” answers the third.
“When Captain So-and-so was here, we
never slowed down. This chap’s got no
nerve at all.”
A month later Captain So-and-so, run-
ning at full speed through a fog, cuts down
another vessel. Fortunately only sailors
are drowned. Still Captain So-and-so has
his certificate suspended by a magistrate,
who takes the biassed view that some pas-
sengers might have lost their lives.. “Serves
him right,” remarks the third engineer.
* * * *
The ship has now almost stopped, and
every half-minute or so the whistle is noisily
booming out two prolonged blasts in quick
succession. This is our intimation to the
invisible steamer that our engines are
stopped, and that we are proceeding with
caution. We receive the same signal.
Gradually the sound of the other’s whistle
draws nearer. Still dead ahead.
“Port!”
The quartermaster spins the diminutive
wheel of the telemotor (it looks ridiculously
inadequate to control a 6000-ton liner), and
the ship’s head falls away to starboard over-
an arc of 90 degrees.
“Steady her 6m.that. Slow ahead!”
Slowly the ship gathers way again. Out
on the port beam our unseen friend is still
bellowing into the fog. Little by little the
sound alters its direction, until it comes
from right astern. The other has stood
straight on, whilst we have performed what
is known as the “Bight point evolution.”
The “old man” looks at the compass.
“Course aarain!”
The little black lubber-line on the binnacle
moves primly round and comes to a rest on
the original course.
“Stop !”
Again the engines cease their perpetual
wrangling, and that uncanny silence only
found on a ship with engines stopped in a
fog, settles down. From our port quarter
comes the sound of the other steamer’s
whistle, now growing fainter. The skipper
gives a little sigh of relief.
“Half-speed again!”
* * * *
The hours pass slowly. Still no sign of the
fog lifting.
Eight bells! Four o’clock. The chief
officer comes on to the bridge to relieve the
second, stifling a yawn as he climbs up the
ladder. The two confer in undertones in the
corner of the bridge for a few minutes ; then
the second goes down to the chart-room to
write up the bridge book, and turn in, bliss-
fully conscious that his troubles are over for
another eight hours. The “old man” watches
him enviously as he descends. “Who’d sell a
farm, and go to sea?” he asks himself, bit-
terly.
Two bells! Five o’clock, and still thick.
Dawn begins to appear in the east. The
blackness of the night merges itself into the
whiteness of the fog, and a uniform grey is
the result. Objects grow more and more
distinct. The masthead and deck lights grow
paler and paler, then die away altogether.
Soon it is broad daylight.
Four bells ! Six o’clock. There is a little
stir around the decks. The routine work of
the day is starting. Men appear from no-
where in particular, going nowhere in par-
ticular. A coal-begrimed fireman, wiping his
face with a greasy sweat rag, crawls up
through the fiddley grating for a breath of
fresh air. He glances shiveringly around,
and returns to the more pleasing warmth of
the stokehold. Sleepv-eyed sailors emerge
from the forecastle, shivering as the raw,
wet fog wraps itself around their bodies,
and, shepherded by the boatswain, commence


to scrub the decks. They look grey and
miserable.; Everything looks grey and miser-
able. Everyone feels grey and miserable.
No sign yet of this confounded tog lifting.
G0d!...-A dim, shapeless mass, showing
as a dark smudge through the fog, looms up
suddenly on the starboard bow. ±ne
startled yell of the look-out man coincides ; to
the fraction of a second with the ‘ old mans
sharp “Full astern!” A wild flurry of foam
under the counter as the propellers churn up
the water; a rattling of shrouds and tunnel
guys as the ship shudders under the astein
thrust of the engines; a moment or two of
nerve-racking suspense for those on the
bridge; and a topsail schooner slides across
our bows a bare 30 yards ahead, thu rust-
streaked sides showing plainly as it luts to
the swell —and is again received into the tog :
The chief officer endeavors unsuccessfully to
prevent his clean-shaven upper lip from
twitching. “Narrow shave, sir,” he remarks
shakily to the “old man.” The latter de-
livers a stirring monologue on the subject ot
small sailing vessels, commanded by sanguin-
ary tailors with dog licenses instead of cer-
tificates, who never trouble about _ sounding
their crimson fog-horns. Referring more
particularly to the flame-colored tailor in
charge of this particular vermilion schooner,
the captain waxes really elonuent. He traces
his descent with minute exactness, comment-
ing libellously on the morality of his ances-
tors, and concludes by expressing a fervent
wish regarding his ultimate end.
Seven o’clock. Is it never going to clear ?
A breeze, light at • first, then _ growing
stronger, springs up from the south’ard. _As
though touched by the wand of a magician,
the fog rolls away, and we are steaming over
a blue sunlit sea, with not a cloud in the
sky. Landwards, the summits of the hills
project through the fog, which still hidbs
their base in soft fleecy folds. “Good
enough!” says the skipper. “Give her full
speed again, sir,” and goes down for a bath
and a shave.
* * * *
An hour later he is seated at the head of
his table, spruce and well-groomed, and ex-
cept for a certain redness about his eyes,
showing no sign that he has stood out nearly
eight hours of nerve-tearing anxiety.
The passenger next to him at breakfast
has enjoyed a capital night’s rest, and is
feeling very contented with himself. “Foggy
in the night, captain?” he asks cheerfully.
“I fancied I heard the whistle.”
The “old man” stirs his coffee thought-
fully. “Um—yes. It was a bit hazy once
or twice.”

The Inter-State Commission.
The, National Government’s Bill providing
for ! the establishment of the Inter-State
Cominission, important in itself, carries
extra weight because it in effect consti-
tutes the Commission a permanent Tariff
Board also. Its three members are to hold
office for seven years, the chairman at
£2500 a year, the other two at £2OQO each,
with reasonable travelling expenses. As to
its duties, the Bill is' explicit ip. .some de-
tails, though vague in others. It is to be
charged with the duty of investigating all
matters affecting the production of and
trade in commodities; the encouragement,
improvement and extension of Australian
manufactures; the opening up of external
trade generally ; the effect and operation of
any Tariff Act in regard to Australian
trade; prices of commodities; profits of
trade and manufactures; wages and social
and industrial conditions: labor and employ-
ment or the lack of it; bounties paid by
foreign countries ; population ; immigration ;
and other matters referred to it by Parlia-
ment for investigation. In its spare time
it “may investigate all matters affecting
diversions from and works affecting rivers,
creeks, etc., and their navigability, as be-
tween the Commonwealth and States and
between the States themselves ; undue pref-
erence or discrimination by common earners,
which include the State railway services,
ferries and any other freight-shifting agencies
of the Commonwealth or a State. Within
constitutional limits the Commission may
also determine complaints of unfair discrim-
ination or preference given by any State*
authority or common carrier or other per-
son in respect of inter-State commerce. It
will have the same power as the High
Court in regard to calling witnesses or de-
manding documents, etc., and the penalties
it may hand out vary from £2OO a day for
disobeying an order, £5OO for refusing to.
give evidence, and £5OO or 12 months’ gaol
for injuring a witness (which includes the
dismissal of a witness by an employer) to
two years’ gaol for fraud on a witness, or
destroying books, and five years’ “hard” for
giving false testimony or committing bribery.
It is to be, as Deakin phrases it, the eyes
and ears of the Commonwealth ; and though
eyes and ears may be exceedingly valuable,
whether they are exceedingly valuable de-
pends mainly upon those who control the
hand and the toe after the eye and the ear
have reported to those members.
The Essential Iron and Steel,
Labor-member Hickey writes :
Re the attitude of N.S.W. Government in passing
the Newcastle Iron and Steel Works Bill to assist the
Broken Hill Prop, to establish iron and steel works
there. Contrary to the view The Bulletin puts for-
ward (21/11/T2), I hold this no dereliction of that
plank of the Labor party’s platform which proposes
to establish State iron works. As far as. one can
penetrate the future, the present Government has no
possible hope of establishing anything of the kind ;
in the meantime the Broken H. Prop, is said to have
£3,000,000 going begging; so why should we be the
dog in the manger ? The chequered career of the
Lithgow iron works goes to show that there is still
pioneering and experimental work to be done, which
might just, as well be carried out by money from private
sources as from the State Treasury; anyhow it is
safer to go into something that has been proven than
into something that has not. With its railways and
shipbuilding yards, the Government probably utilises
three-fifths of the iron consumed in the State, so one
day when this plank becomes law this trade will
represent a nice little bit to go on with, no matter
what private cos. may be doing business in the line.
There is nothing strange in the idea of assisting a
new industry. A Bradford-tops industry at Botany
(N.S.W.) is assisted by a bonus on every lb. of wool
exported. Hundreds, perhaps thousands, of industries
are assisted every day by a beneficent Protectionist
tariff. The assistance on this occasion means a little
dredging, on the original cost of which the Prop.
Co. will pay 5 p.c. p.a. for 50 years. I would like
to here point out that in the opinion of Percy
Allan, Chief Engineer for Public Works, Newcastle
district, _ the dredging should be done by 'the State
for nothing, as a port improvement. The chances are
that some leagues will make a row at the coming
Labor conference, but it would be nothing to the
row that the North would make, with its unswerving
support for Labor from the first gong, if such good
business were turned away. Anyhow, row or no row,
the question is which is the best for the country? I
think (in the language of Mr. Willis) the ayes have
On which The Bulletin drops a few ob-
servations :
(1) The Broken Hill Prop, has no £3,000,000
“going begging.” It has to raise the money for the
new enterprise. And it is a dreadful reflection on
somebody if the State of N. S. Wales can’t raise the
money more easily and on far better terms than a
mining co., whose chief asset—its mine—is just about
worked out.
(2) It may be the N.S.W. State Labor party’s way
to permit and encourage Private Enterprise to do
costly experimental work with the idea that, when
that work is done, the State shall step in, boot P.E.
out, and collar the proceeds for itself. But it isn’t
The Bulletin’s, way. And The Bulletin doesn’t
believe it is the majority of the Labor party’s way
either.
(3) Anyhow, the talk of pioneering and experi-
mental work is mostly rubbish. Compared with
much of : the metallurgical work now being done in
Australia, iron and steel making is a very simple
process: It is quite safe to say that the Hoskins
firm has made big money at Lithgow, notwithstanding
the handicaps there. The experimental work has been
already done.
(4) Iron and steel are the basis of the most
vital industries of the country—of the industries H
has and those it ought to have. Therefore it is most
necessary that the production of what is practicallv
the raw material of the most vital industries should
be in the hands of people whose one desire will be,
not to make dividends, but to supply the raw material
at the lowest possible price. \
(5) The Government certainly does give help to the
private manufacturers of wool-tops, and does not
think of making wool-tops itself. The difference
between that and the iron-and-steel case is that the
State isn’t a buyer of wool-tops to any extent at all,
while on Simon Hickey’s admission it takes three-
fifths of all the iron and steel consumed in N. S.
Wales..
(6) If Simon Hickey doesn’t know that Vested
Interests are the tallest obstacle in the Labor party’s
path, and that the Labor party’s latest decision merely
helps to create another great Vested Interest, he can
only be unaware of the fact because he is the
youngest member of the party. Which, by the way,
may be some excuse for Hickey. For other mem-
bers of the party there is no excuse whatever.
Socialistic Tortoise-races; likewise State-
aided Musical Chairs.
Year by year the State-aided A., H. and P.
shows ge,t closer and closer to the pure-
vaudeville line. For example, the following
is an extract from a local newspaper account
of the last Lismore (N.S.W.) Show:—
The motor events created considerable interest, and
the sight of about 20 cars parading the ring was much
appreciated by the onlookers. , The events resulted
Tilting at the ring. Once round. First prize, £2 ;
second, 10s The exhibition Was a good one, con-
sidering the little practice many of therii had.
Slowest Oar Around the Ring, otherwise the Tor-
toise Race Eight competitors, but the contest did
not create any excitement....
Musical Chairs. First prize, £2; second, 10s.—
There were seven competitors, and the event created
much amusement. The result was: G. Simmons 1-
F. J. Board, 2.
Already the folk's who patronise these alleg-
edly instructive exhibitions are offered in
return for their modest admission money a
vast collection of “ring events.” comprising
high-jumping competitions, engaged in mostly
by aged and spavined animals that would be
better employed in a" circus; “hunting
events.” contested by steeds that have never
hunted in their lives'; tandem matches and
buckjumping turns; trotting races, and a
dozen more ludicrouslv irrelevant items of
the sort. At certain Queensland A., 11. and
P. shows the Yankee aviator Stone was en-
gaged to give a series of flying exhibitions,
and the Australian aviator Hart had been
booked to fly at a number of forthcoming
Western (N. S. Wales) shows at the time of
his accident. There was actually a proposi-
tion on foot recently to stage a boxing con-
test as a special line for the third day of one
big A., 11. and P. show, but, unfortunately
for the gaiety of the nation, it fell through.
The side-shows at most of the bigger insti-
tutions of this sort grow in number and
variousness every year. And none of them
have any more connection with the agricul-
tural or pastoral businesses than the J. C.
Williamson Co. has. The paper,
above-quoted, disclosed the point of view of
the typical A., H. and P. Society commit-
teeman in these appallingly frank words: —
As long as the society can offer an interesting pro-
gramme for the third day, there need be no fear of lack
of public interest. Year by year the three days Show
becomes more popular, as shown by the increased
gate receipts' on the third day. The programme yes-
terday was not strictly one which would he embraced
under the heading oj an Agricultural Society's pro-
gramme.
The inwardness of the absurd business is to
be found, of course, in the £ for f subsidy
arrangement, under which the societies get
20s. from the State for every sovereign they
extract from the public by way of payments
for “side-show” stands, entries, gate money,
etc., etc. If the squandering of the tax-
payers’ money in this way did any real
good ; if it taught the anti-Socialistic farmer
to grow two hogs where but one grew before,
or helped the rabidly individualistic hus-
bandman to produce better mangels or
onions, there would be no kick coming from
anyone. But it does not. It only causes
him to lose his money betting over the trot-
ting events, or to get drunk, as a surcease
from the boredom of watching old, old
horses loping, with senile deliberation, over
the tall timber. In fact, the whole system
amounts to a confidence trick and a swindle.
The N. S. Wales Minister for Public In-
struction has already made a move in the
right direction by regulating the conditions
governing the payment of subsidies to
Schools of Arts —institutions which have
hitherto been little else, in many cases, than
State-assisted billiard saloons. The time is
likewise ripe for Governments to similarly
exercise their discretionary powers in con-
nection with the A., H. and P. Societies.
Nobody minds paying-up to help the sturdily
anti-Sosh agriculturist learn his business,
but when it comes to the State weigh-
ing in with half the cost of his variety
entertainments, there is a general sentiment
that the brotherhood of man business is
being overdone.

Irrigation in Victoria.
Water Commissioner Elwood Mead, the
one-armed Yankee who for £3OOO a year takes
charge of the watering of the Victorian
cabbage-garden, is fast covering the North-
ern and Western provinces of the State with
a network of irrigation channels. The total
area now artificially supplied with water
for stock and domestic purposes is 13,000,000
•acres. Of this only 215,333 acres are under
irrigated culture, though even that is 50
per cent, more than it was a year ago. A
scheme for watering some 6000 square miles
of the thirsty Wimmera —the Victorian
granary—is also on the point of comple-
tion. Some of the main channels here are
160 miles long, and surveys for still further
extensions are being made. Into this job
£4,319,032 has already been sunk. The big
Waranga reservoir, on the Goulburn River,
just above Murchison, alone cost £731,201,
and it isn’t half big enough. One of its
main channels carries water 92 miles to
the Tragowel plains. But there is a sharp
limit set to this irrigation expansion; and
the Victorian experts are even now in sight
of it. This limit is the water supply itself.
The entire annual outflow of the Murray,
including the contribution of all its tribu-
taries, such as the Darling and the Mur-
rumbidgee, is but six million acre-feet a
year. In practice, 70 per cent, of this is
lost in evaporation, seepage and other forms
of waste, leaving a bare two million acre-
feet for actual use. Divide this again by
three, and Victoria will be seen to be pretty
well up to the limit of its share. N. S.
Wales and Soustralia have most of theirs
yet to take ; but the fond idea that irriga-
tion is going to work anything like a
universal transformation of the Never Never
country makes a rather poor showing, in
face of these figures. On the other hand,
Mead has adopted the natural remedy for
the scandalously heavy deficits'that followed
past misuse of State irrigation works, and
which made it necessary to write off a mat-
ter of £1,268,912 from the ratings a few
years ago. That remedy is the principle of
compulsory charges, whether the water is
used or unused. This is almost a notice to
quit to the big loafing landlord, who has
now to either put his broad and empty acres
to intense cultivation, or else subdivide and
sell out. Hence the exceedingly pathetic
cry for the instant abolition of State con-
trol. and a return to the bad old system of
local trust

The Maligned ‘Asiatic.
Some people have a vague idea that the
allegedly foolish folk who insist on exclud-
ing the Japanese from Australia do so in a
spirit of blind prejudice and ignorance. As
a matter of fact, they object to the Japs
most who know them best. The Austra-
lians who first advocated alien exclusion
laws knew what they were doing, and so do
the people who stand out for the continu-
ance and strict administration of those
laws. It is invariably those who have never
come in close association with the Jap—
clerics, untravelled politicians, suburban
Empire-leaguers and the like—who babble
about his virtues. The Caucasians who
have studied him on his native heath all
have the same tale to tell. For example,
U. G. Murphy, of Nagoya, is an American
Methodist who has been missionising in
Japan for the past 20 years. The other
day the Methodist Publishing House, of
New York, issued a book of his which, in
a couple of hundred pages, presents the
White Australian’s whole case against the
brown man, with a bit over for luck. To
illustrate the attitude of the race in regard
to social matters Murphy tells of a man
who had been employed for years, in con-
junction with his brother in Seattle, ex-
porting Jap women to America. He was
arrested for faking the passports of the
human wares he dealt in, and this letter
from his brother was found on him:—
The last lot is giving trouble, and I am afraid
I shall not even get the bargain money out of them.
They are too common. I intend to work them a
while and then cast them off. Of the lot before the
last, Koto has a good face and takes well with
white men—Americans. Smzu, of the same lot, is
weak and is in the hospital at present. It may be
necessary to give her some rough treatment and
settle her case. It is best to make Seattle or Vic-
toria the place of landing. Vancouver is no good.
“Rough treatment,” the author explains in
a footnote, means “kill her”; and he goes
on to remark :
After serving a sentence of 20 days in gaol for
violating passport regulations, the man was released
and is probably plying his trade again.
A few observations which Murphy drops
casually at the beginning of his book con-
stitute a whole sermon in the difference be-
tween the Asiatic’s attitude and that of the
white man, as regards social matters. Says
Murphy :
Very few crimes of violence against women are
ever reported by the victims. As a rule, prosecution
comes from some member of the family. The police
pay very little attention to attempts at seduction,
outrages and insults to women on the streets, or in
their own homes. This is another way of saying that
such things are so common as to cause little com-
ment. Th.s disrespect for the virtue of women is no
new thing. The religious and moral teachings preva-
lent in all the East tends to place women on a very
low level. The consequence is that the sanctity of the
person is not regarded in the same light that it is in
so-called Christian countries.
These are among the reasons why the Aus-
tralian dislikes the Jap. If he were other-
wise the most honest, truthful, law-
abiding and humane of mortals (which he
isn’t) the possession of such qualities, so
the Australian holds, renders lum an un-
desirable inhabitant of a white man’s
country.
Facing the Facts.
Richard Arthur, M.L.A., writes: —
It is almost incredible that my views on Aus-
tralian defence should have been so distorted in the
press as to evoke The Bulletin article last week.
I have been for years, and am now, a consistent ad-
vocate of an Australian army and navy. Only I
want a real army and a real navy; and so I assail
with fury the statements of a Fisher who says that
our cadets are equal in discipline to any troops he
has seen, of a Pearce who tells us that the battle-
cruiser Australia will be the most powerful ship
in this part of the world, and of a Colonel Foster
who alleges that 600,000 tons of shipping would be
needed to bring 25,000 men to our shores, and that,
therefore, Australia cannot he invaded.
My position is this. Japan is the enemy, and
when her moment comes she will strike as she struck
at Russia. But the moment is not yet, nor will be
unless conflict arises between England and Germany. -
Were the British navy shattered either by victory or
defeat, the moment would have arrived, and of what
avail would one Australia or two be against the
Japanese fleets? Next year she will have four super-
Dreadnoughts, each of which could blow the Aus-
tralia out of the water, as well as four Dreadnoughts
and innumerable other ships. Now, I say, press on
with the Australian navy, order more ships of the
highest class at once, and enlist more men. As to the
army, make it an army by giving the lads at least four
or six months’ continuous training in camp. The
men of that impoverished little Balkan State which
drove the Turk to the walls of Constantinople were
not drilled for a few hours in the dark, and for eight
days in a camp. It needed two years of training
to make them fit to face the carnage round Adrian-
ople.
The fate of Australia for many years to come is
bound up with that of the Empire. The chief danger
point of the Empire is therefore also that of Australia.
At present that point of strategic necessity lies in the
North Sea. There, therefore, our battle-cruiser
should be, but manned by Australians. And there
also our new battleships should go until the tension
eases. We can keep our smaller ships here to. de-
velop our sea sense.
And in the precious years of peace we may thus
secure we should go on pumping in population, thus
strengthening our garrison and increasing our
revenue. And for this purpose, and to create a real
army and navy, we should be ready to shoulder any
burden of taxation, and make any sacrifice. When
we have 10 million people we can hope, joined with
Maoriland and Canada, to have a Pacific fleet that
will defy any Yellow Peril. But, most important
of all, let us face the facts.
And The Bulletin’s point of view is some-
thing like this. It is admirable to have a
Health Department and bacteriological lab-
oratories, etc., to try to suppress disease.
And it is good to have inspectprs oi scaffold-
ing, etc., to minimise the risk of broken
limbs. But it would be folly not to have the
local doctor available in.case Dad is brought
home with a shattered leg, or little Willie
gets the measles.

“Fax”: The gentle ways of Private Enter-
prise again ! Last year, owing to the hor-
rible understanding amongst buyers of pigs,
the Vic. cockies got such starvation prices
for their grunting goods that they screwed
up enough courage to start a co-operative
bacon factory at Dandenong (Vic.). An
English expert bacon-curer was imported,
with an eye on the export market, and for
a time all went swimmingly. The co-op. co.
now finds itself with £lO,OOO worth of cured
pig on the premises, for which it can get no
outlet, the private curers having evidently
ordered the retailers not to stock Dandenong
bacon. The co-op. co.’s capital is exhausted
to its last bean, and it has had to refuse
consignments from its shareholders for lack
of the needful to pay for them. The direc-
tors now put the position to the share-
holders that they want £20.000 of new trad-
ing capital to fight the “honorable under-
standing.” or else up go the shutters. The
co-op. co. ceased to receive supplies on the
26th November, and, three days later, the
bottom fell right out of the pig market,
baconers dropping from 107 s. to 655. This,
audacious squeeze will go a long way to make:
the Anti-Sosh cocky put up his cash and:
stay in the game. Also, it may whisper in
his ear that it wouldn’t be a bad thing to
give a strong National Government the
power which it asks for to deal with trusts,
combines and other bandits.
Vida Goldstein’s Women’s Political Asso-
ciation (Vic.) has unanimously carried this
mnstly-sensible resolution: —
This association empliaticallv protests against the
hideous crime committed in the name of morality
against girls, by compelling them to marry their
seducers, and considers that there should be a legal
age of marriage, and that it should be 21 at least,
so that girls may have a chance of obtaining s6me
knowledge of life and its responsibilities before enter-
ing upon marriage.
But what about the baby? Of course there
shouldn’t be any baby, and the State that
doesn’t discourage the infant who arrives
without a wedding doesn’t know what is
good for its health. But the young woman
who isn’t old enough to marry because she
doesn’t know much about “life and its re-
sponsibilities,” also, as a rule, doesn’t know
enough to keep off the grass when the grass
looks inviting. So the infant will arrive,
Before Armageddon.
[FOR THE BULLEITN.]
Watchman, gazing down the night,
Are the fires of doom alight?
Will the dawn come red with blood
Where the navies ride the flood?
Is the shroud of battle spun
’Neath the black lips of the gun,
Where with pallid brow and cheek
Men are dumb till death shall speak?
And thfe watchman, gazing a-down the nighty
Flung back an answer for all to hear:
“The lamps of the world are trimmed and
bright,
But the hearts of the nations are cold with
fear.
The linstock is lighted, the feast is spread.
And the battle eagle is fierce for prey;
Tbe song is sung, and the prayer is said,
While the white stars tremble to greet the
day.”

Who may land to our sorrow In Sydney
to-morrow. And cut up the wicket With

Or sit out by the sea With our girl on

To be true and exact, Unless someone
shoots well, May play all sorts of hell
And spoil the whole Commonwealth

O’er the meadows of the dead ?
And the watchman, gazing against the dawn,
Flung back an answer for all to hear:
“The!' clouds are thick and the stars with-
drawn,
And the world is cold with the elder fear;
And a vibrant silence in all the air
Draws tense the cords of the statesman’s
heart,
While a people’s sob that is wordless prayer
Would tear the darkness of God apart.”
(And all the while, With an easy smile,
Alfred Deakin and Joseph Cook: Are
Trying their best by hook and crook To
play in a lame Sort of way the game Of

wards it —and its mother. If the mother,
a voungster mostly, is going to get the cold

“Sturdy Loyalist” demands a hearing:—
I see that our leader, Mr. Arthur Macarthur,
spoke as follows, on Saturday last, in re the seizure
of Sydney Government House by the lower orders :• —
“Regarding the necessary funds required for the
legal action being taken against the Government, I
am confident these will be forthcoming at once. We
naturally prefer that the contributions should come
from a number in a national matter of this kind, rather
than that the whole of the work and expense should
be borne by a few patriots ; thus the appeal is made
to the people of New South Wales, city and country,
with every confidence.”
Every true Imperialist will agree with those
spirited remarks. It is contended by the disloyalists
that no one, barring a few Liberals in search of
political capital, cares much what happens to Gov-
ernment House. It is a libel on a loyal community,
and the surest way to rebut it is, plainly, to give the
people a chance to prove their detestation of
McGovven’s action by providing the money to fight
it in a court of law. To that end, a shilling sub-
scription fund should be at once opened by the
newspapers. It will, of course, be largely oversub-
scribed by the thousands of King’s men and women
who are yearning to demonstrate their affection for
the throne. After the few hundreds sterling needed
by the lawyers for their services have been expended,
the surplus might go towards the founding of a
Home for Distressed Knights, or something Imperial
of that sort. In any event, whoever subscribes the
money, and whoever handles it, everything should be
open and above board. N. S. Wales has a right
to know its patriots, and the patriots have a right
to know iust how their cash is being spent. As a
loyal business-man, I trust that full accounts of all
the financial details in connection with the legal
flagellation of this pestiferous Administration will
be supplied.
By the way, I should like, as a self-respecting citi-
zen, to lodge a protest against the misguided en-
thusiasm in the cause of Empire that was displayed
by various loyalists during the demonstration of Sat-
urday. A stout, elderly lady-imperialist, in a lace
coat and glasses, speaking in the cultivated tones of'
Upper Tooting (England), expressed scandalised
amazement that the crowd did not “tear McGowen
to pieces.” The hooting in which we were persuaded
to indulge as soon as the Ministerialists appeared
was a mistake. It provoked the Socialists to re-
prisals, and as there were, apparehtly, about 40
Socialists to every loyal gentleman or lady, our
spokesman, Mr. Henley, had a poor hearing. A
small Loyalist, with a purple face and a ruined
bowler hat, would have been better at home—for
several reasons. However, much was atoned for by
the splendid spectacle of Field-Marshal Ryrie, M.H.r!,
his strictly honest, if slightly unintellectual, coun-
tenance aflame with Imperialism, chanting the
National Anthem entirely without assistance.
Color-Sergeant Everington, accidentally
shot at Fremantle (W.A.) the other day*
was the first of Australia’s young citizen
soldiers to die in uniform and on duty, and
to have a military funeral. The fine young-
ster, a crack shot, had been one of Westra-
lia’s two representatives to visit Canada,
and the boat in which he was returning had
just come alongside the home wharf when
the accident happened.
( If the worst happens to the McGowen
Government, Premier Jim, who can still sing
a decent song, should be able to get into the
burnt-cork business. A lullaby on these
lines might be popular:—
Oh, my Beeby ! Kv curly-beaded Beeby !
Who's gone an’ lef’ de dear ol’ home an’ gwine far
1 away—
Aw-ay! Aw-ay!
Oh, my Beeby! My wand’rih’ little Beeby !

Harry Jackson, who was Speaker of S.A.
Assembly from Jenkin Coles’s death until
the present Peake Government came in and
collared the _ “spoils,” achieved a record last
week. He is the first man whom the As-
sembly has ever resolved shall be “no longer
heard,” though the Leg. Council did it once
long ago. Ex-Treasurer Waddell (N.S.W.)
may take it as a compliment (or the re-
verse) that a persistent quotation of his
remarks on immigration was responsible.
The Chairman twice ruled Waddell’s ideas
to be “not relevant,” and then Premier Peake
brought out the gag. It was carried by 18
to 15, accepted fairly quietly, and removed
a little later, “the authority of the Chair
having been vindicated.”
Defence-Minister Pearce, standing hatless
in the rain, spoke brave words to a little
band of Australian cadets at Malvern
(Yic.). Said he:—
They must learn the duty they owed to their
country. They were the most favored nation, in that
their soil had never been drenched with bloodshed in
war. How long would that immunity last? They
would be tempting fortune if they shut their eyes to
what was going on around them, so the Parliament
and people of Australia had determined to train the
rising manhood of the country, so that it would be
properly equipped to do its duty.
Just so! But is the Parliament doing its
duty ? The cadets are all right; the trouble
is they will be no good where they are when
the day comes to be busy. The invasion
won’t begin at Malvern or any other suburb
handy to the snapshotter and the film-manu-
facturer ; it will happen on some, no doubt,
already-selected bay, inlet or creek between
Darwin and Cairns. And Australia’s prob-
lem then will be how to get there to bid
the visitors good-morning.

The most delightful play that has recently
drifted to Australia is “Milestones,” by
Arnold Bennett and Edward Knoblauch,
given its first representation at Sydney
Criterion last Saturday. There is no'prob-
lem in it, no sex appeal, no thrill, no moral,
no “star” ; the thing is merely atmosphere.
The authors have taken three periods in the
lives of a few persons and shown the evolu-
tion in human life and human ideals. Thus,
the dashing young hero of 1860 becomes the
stodgy father in middle age, and the dodder-
ing wreck in old age. “Milestones” heaves a
heavy brick of common sense at the matinee
flapper who believes that the matinee hero
remains always young. The play is really
an essay in Darwinism, with Mendel thrown
in. One sees the rise of a go-ahead man to
fortune and social position, and his unavail-
ing efforts to cement his new title by inter-
marriage with the aristocracy. The result of
all his strivings is that his daughter, after
the death of the futile lord she was com-
pelled to marry, takes for husband a Labor
M.P., while his grand-daughter marries the
descendant of a capable typewriter girl from
Yorkshire.
“HARBOR LIGHTSAT." SYDNEY
ROYAL.
The Resure. Hero descending the wobbly
cliffs during a storm (the spray and thunder
may be observed at work).
The plot shows John Rhead, a progressive
ironmaster, risking his fortune to build ships
of iron ; 25 years later he has become Bruce
Smith, and considers that the time is not
yet ripe for steel ships ; and 27 years later
he is still more Brucesmithish, but his senile
prejudices are swept aside by the younger
generation, and he learns passively to sub-
mit and even delightfully to philosophise on
his defeat. “Milestones” is a sermon, and
its text is “The time is always ripe.”
The production marks the emancipation of
Julius Knight from the obsession of his
calves, and, now that the calcium no longer
dogs his footsteps, discloses that Julius
Knight is a brilliant and artistic producer,
and an actor, sound and (in parts that are
no longer young) almost great. In this play
he consistently refuses to step one inch out
of the picture ; and the almost perfect cast
emphasises his self-sacrifice in the interest
of art. As John Rhead of the first act
he was obviously not youthful enough,
but in the succeeding acts his work was con-
vincing and delightfully artistic. Especially
was his old man a triumph of demeanor and
accent. The end of the play, showing the
two old grandparents sitting over the fire,
joined by the placid acceptance of old age,
was not marred by the slightest false note.
As there is no hero, so there is no
heroine. Miss Eily Malyon, as the crinolined
maiden, all swooning grace and meek sus-
ceptibility, made an instant artistic appeal;
and the note of vapid sweetness she retained
in the difficult later stages of her life. This
impersonification ranks with that of Julius
Knight. Miss Malyon gave to the first act,
with the assistance of Miss Maggie Knight,
as the old-fashioned Mrs. Rhead, its atmo-
sphere of sweetness and placid decorum that
remains the chief note of the play. Miss
Grace Armatage Noble, in the difficult part
of the rebel, Gertrude Rhead, of the first
act, who becomes the old maid and the still-
rebellious old woman, just failed to suggest
the full import of this pivotal character. In
the second act, however, she gave full value
to the pathos required. Miss Irene Browne
made in the second act a delightful and
attractive picture in the hideous dress of 1885.
In modern costume she showed that the
evolution of the corset does give the figure of
the modern woman a chance. Her dramatic
ability was rather harassed by the great
strain put upon her in the third act. Miss
Mary Goulden, as the modern girl, could
have been as self-assured as the authors
meant her to be without giving, what the
authors surely never intended, that sugges-
tion of tartness. Of Miss Emma Temple in
a character part it is unnecessary to do
aught but commend an assured actress. One
expects artistic . acting from Leslie Victor,
and his picture of the exquisite Ned Pym,
of the first act, and his modish foolishness
of the second was another of his growing
triumphs. Arthur Greenaway made a fine
figure in the picturesque attire of the Vic-
torian era, and was equal to the impersona-
tion of childish old age and doting father-
hood in the second act. As the youthful
inventor, Herbert Ford hardly suggested the
ingenuous youth, but age matured his acting,
and as the Labor member he showed assured
ease and manliness. Martin Lewis was suffi-
ciently fatuous as a modern lord ; and Ronald
Macleod was admirably in the picture in the
little he had to do as young Richard Sibley.
“Milestones” is the sort of play that people
will want to see more than once. It will not
be necessary for the management to invite
a horde of parsons to guarantee its respec-
tability.

Little Willie has been dying 'every evening
this week at the Adelphi. The Bulletin
mourns for Willie, as in duty bound; still
when it remembers that Willie’s father takes
hold of the poor six-year-old youngster, and
commands him to form himself into a
prayer meeting in the middle of the draw-
ing-room and “pray for mercy on this dis-
honored house,” it realises that, if he had
lived, he would probably have had a poor,
dull time. East Lynne,” of which Willie
was the hope and heir, will fill in time till
Saturday, when something entitled “The

The Beni Zoug Zoug troupe of Arabs at
the Tivoli is the nearest approach to a tor-
nado that Sydney has experienced since the
early days of Mr. Willis’s Speakership. The
turn opens with a grand march headed by a
band —or something that is more like a band
than a lot of other things. This acts as a
sort of preliminary whirlwind. Then the
double-Zougs get busy on a series of amaz-
ing pyramids, with one Zoug as base and
anything up to 10 other Zougs standing on
top of him. When Benjamin Z.Z. gets tired
of acting as a foundation-stone, the troupe
resolves itself into various brands of circu-
wi. .°P era t e d by a runaway engine.
When it is all over one can’t help asking
the Lord to have mercy on the soul of any-
one who meets an army of Arabs that means
to be unfriendly. Fanny Powers is putting
in a short farewell season prior to imitating
a number of other nice girls she has seen
and heard. Then she retires from the stage.
She is to be tendered a complimentary

and the rest of the programme is much the
same, except that there seems to be more
sameness about some of it than there was
previously.

In the forefront of the National Amphi-
theatre bill stands Fred Curran, comedian.
Despite his almost frenzied protests (for he
is one of the most self-effacing jesters un-
hung), his employers insist on mentioning
that he is “a sterling artist,” and “has had
the honor of appearing before the King and
Queen at a command performance.” No-
thing but kindly consideration for his feel-
ings has prevented them from also disclos-
ing the fact that the King was so delighted
with Frederick’s turn that at the conclu-
sion of it he presented him with a Bible —
the identical one of which he has (vide last

andra. read a chapter daily ever since ht
was first invested with trousers, Marta
Golden, character artist, Newman and
Hughes, The Dual Dixies, and Armstrong
and Verne are others who add to the gaiety
or gloom of the entertainment, as the case
may be.

When General Public gets tired of
looking at the pictures in the Crystal Pal-
ace, the old fellow has only to drop in next
door and view La Something-or-other (pos-
sibly Maria .Tones) amusing herself with
snakes. Not that he will get a barrow-load
for his money. Snake “charming” is, at
any time, an unexhilarating business, and
Maria doesn’t tend to make it otherwise. In
the picture department “The Clown’s Re-
venge” is a mixture of legs, love, hate and
revenge, with a dual funeral as a finish.
The circus scenes and the general get-up of
the film are good, but the plot doesn’t break
much new ice. “Williams’s Weekly” has
some good snaps of the “eviction” fiasco,
as well as a fine series of views of the ISft.
yacht championship in the harbor.

A machine-made play by Baddon Cham-
bers, “The Awakening,” was more or less
butchered by amateurs at Sydney Palace
last Friday. “The Awakening” is not one
of the author’s successes ; it is too thin and
too unreal. In the interpretation, Leslie
Casey brought experience to bear on a diffi-
cult part, with quite satisfactory results, and
Miss Dorothy Cumming showed decided signs
of temperament in an exacting rble. Her
work and the charmingly naive simplicity
of Miss Lily Titheradge made up for the
rest of the cast, who managed to give
nothing better than a surface rendering of
their parts. The staging was unimpeachable,
likewise the society audience.

At the King’s, on Saturday night, a com-
paratively small house witnessed a revival
of “The Prince and the Beggar Maid.”
But, if small, the gallery, at any rate, was
noisy, especially when Roy Redgrave re-
appeared in his old part of Prince Mike, the
blue-blooded hunchback. The story of how
Hildred, the bad boy of the Sylvanian royal
family, made war on Monica of Illyria, as
a token of his undying affection for that
lady, is not lacking in absurdity; neverthe-
less it makes one of the most picturesque of
Andersonian bellowdramas. Monica does
not look with favor upon Hildred’s sanguin-
ary courtship, and for his sins that mis-
guided royalty is hustled off this planet in
the last act. And though Freedom squeaks
when Illyria falls, joy quickly supervenes
when it is known that Monica intends to
commit matrimony in company with bonnie
Prince Olaf. Roy Redgrave wins a good
deal of moist sympathy for Mike, the royal
hunchback; Cyril Mackay makes Olaf as
beauteous as a hairdresser’s model: Rut-
land Backett is very satisfactory as Hil-
dred the Hotstuff ; Miss Olive Wilton repeats
her pantomimic representation of the inci-
dental beggar-maid; Miss Eugenie Duggan
again stands for the last hope of the Illyrian
monarchy; and Temple Harrison appears
as a dumb servant, who wanders about
wearing a joyless expression. The banner
of Romance will fly from the flagpole at
the King’s until Boxing night, when “The
Girl of the Never-Never,” a brain-child of
which Jo Smith blushingly acknowledges
the parentage, will set out to win love and
lucre.

McMahon’s Repertory Theatre commenced
its seventh season with “Man and Super-
man,” at the Melbourne Athenaeum. The
Schopenshawan comedy was presented
without the Tophet act and the brigands,
but John Tanner’s motor-car made an im-
posing appearance, and appropriated a good
deal of limelight and an excessive amount
of stage space. The story of how Ann
Whitefield went husband-hunting, and was
a Tanner to the good when the chase ended,
was followed with an interest which the
longest of Shaw’s speeches failed to dissi-
pate. The cast was scarcely inferior to
the one which gave a good account of
itself in “John Gabriel Borkman.” Gregan
McMahon, made up to look rather like
Pshaw himself, supplied good value for his
Tanner. The pint pot of praise may also be
handed, almost full, to Thomas Cletus(’Enry
Straker) and Gerald Carr (Ricky-ticky-
tavy), and the teacup of approbation, with
two lumps of sugar, to Miss Isabel Handley,
Miss Maud Jolliffe and Miss Fannie Fowler.
Kingsley Norris made Roebuck Ramsden
too much like the heavy father of bellow-
drammer, and the Hector Malone of Arthur
Wrixon suffered from an impediment in his
elocution, and was a rather dreary jest all
round.
* * * *
The new item on the second Repertory
bill was Shaw’s “The Dark Lady of the
Sonnets,” previously produced in Adelaide.
W. Shakspeare is represented in conversa-
tion with a beefeater, what time he waits
outside the royal palace for Mary Fitton.
Certain phrases spoken negligently by the
beefeater are duly noted by William, who is
thereupon rebuked as a snapper-up of un-
considered trifles—which observation also
finds a place in his notebook. Queen Liz
appears and furnishes Bill with more
phrases with which to tickle the ears of
posterity ; notably the remark about the per-
fumes of Arabia, put into the mouth of Mrs.
Macbeth, which many a suburban alderman
has since fired off when advocating the re-
moval of the local boiling-down works. The
playlet is unsensational, although it con-
tains many gleams. McMahon’s Shakspeare
was not always certain of his lines, and
Miss Rose Seaton’s Liza was inclined to
scamp those of hers which contained pointed
references to the Virgin Queen; however,
the regal female was . fairly good, as roy-
alties go. Mrs. John Sanderson made a
brief (yet not too brief) appearance as
William’s Mary, and John Fowler’s husky
beefeater is hereby fined Is. Bd. for exaggera-
tion and asthma. Galsworthy’s “The
Pigeon,” which was put on during the
theatre’s last season, followed the Shavian
trifle, and the various passers-by and look-
ers-in were performed, except in a couple of
minor instances, by the same people as pre-
viously.
“ GET-RICH-QUICK WALLINGFORD ,”
AT MELBOURNE ROYAL.
The Bus Driver
(Robert White ,
junior).

(Janies H. Manning).
“Her Forbidden Marriage,” at Melbourne
Princess’s, is largely the story of Lucy,
sweet and doleful, who marries George
Maddison, the great inventor, and endures
four or five acts of tribulation, darkened by
the doings of the comic relief. As befits the
hero of Marlowdrama, George has to suffer
many vicissitudes. His troubles begin with
a semi-sultry invitation from Lady Lucretia
Lancaster at a midnight hour, and after he
has repelled her with virtuous language, he
becomes the victim of a robbery charge
arranged by the lady’s accomplice, Charles
Devereux. Thereupon George is shoved into
prison; but in Act 111. he escapes to save
his wife from the designs of C. Devereux,
who has turned one eye on her beauty and
the other on her cash. After that, the hero’s
fortunes visibly improve, and when he comes
into money and discovers, that the husband
of his would-be seductress is his pa, there
is nothing to do but play out the audience
to a lively air.
* * * *
People accustomed to the genial insanities
of Marlowdrama will find little in the pre-
sent effusion to excite their astonishment.
The play is a sort of tour de farce with a
medley of commonplace incidents that offers
the company no incentive to decent acting.
Under those circumstances, Hugh Buckler
is excused for practically bullocking through
an heroic part. The Misses Jennie Pollock
and Violet Paget are passable as Lady
Lucretia and Lucy respectively; and llii-
liard Vox’s wickedness (he is Devereux) is
at least a gentlemanly business. D’Arcy
Kelway is admonished for apparently em-
bezzling some of the antics of Bertie
Wright; and P. V. Scully (Sir George Lan-
caster) must do something else to earn
immortality. One or two other persons
patter or gargle their lines, and the scenery
is so careless that qne gets the impression
that stagecraft is moribund at the Princess
Theatre.

The Lancaster opera company, which
arrived at the Opera House on Saturday,
consists of three male persons, made up to
look like wicked brigands, and three ladies,
attired as Spanish gypsies or Norwegian
flappers or something of the kind. The six
warble attractively and dance energetically.
Another dancer is My Fancy, a light-footed
performer who, according to the programme,
recently shuffled her toes before Geo. V. and
his missus. Lest this paper should be sus-
pected of disloyalty or a desire to “cut the
painter,” it hastens to assure the lady of its
undying respect, and to express regret that
it is unable to become excited over her turn.
Welch and Carbasse have blown in with a
sketch, “The Call Boy and the Actress,”
which is so utterly banal that the sooner
it blows out the better. Will Whitburn and
the Rallis and Wilson acrobatic trio are
fresh revivals, and Alberto Marini and
Claire Romaine may be classed as welcome
survivals.

The casual frailty of \yoman was quaintly
depicted in “Ostler Joe,” a feature of the
bill at Melbourne Majestic on Saturday.
Joe’s missus levants after presenting him
with a bouncing babe; yet Joseph has only
a hug of forgiveness for her when she turns
up at his premises to die at great length,
and make him responsible for the undertak-
er’s expenses. “Two Cinders and Two
Eyes” was a different story, rather mushy
in sentiment, but containing the hugger-
mugger that pleases the flapper and encour-
ages her best boy to giddy emulation.
“Petronilla’s Steeplechase” , and “Disap-
pointed Mama”- were comedies in the A 1
class; and there was also a brilliant study of
the antics of the Dytiscus, a water-beetle
that is seemingly the champion pug in its
moist little world.

Though the recent weather has only been

of the co. warbled their lays or burbled their
gags to the evident satisfaction of their con-
gregations.

“The Wheel of Destruction',” which whizzed
at Melbourne Olympia on Saturday, will give
the average citizen palpitation of the emo-
tional centres. The picture was a real
thriller, with heaps of love, lots of wicked-
ness and a big helping of sensation. “A
Double Danger” was something of a domestic
drama, the chief figure being a penurious
papa, who raises the cash to cure a dying
ehe-ild by snaring a convict and annexing
the reward for his apprehension. “Blossoms”
was a charming horticultural study; and
“Three to One” was a fairly acceptable
comedy, in which good acting compensated
for the age of the plot.

Shows at Adelaide have been very various
during the past fortnight. The Royal is
filled by Hugo’s American minstrels, brisk,
noisy and unusual. They are the real thing
in coons, and they enliven the city streets
with a noontide parade every day. Cold and
wet weather has hampered the outdoor
shows, but a touch of summer now gives them
their chance. This same warmth helped to
boom Henley-on-Torrens, a regatta in the
heart of the city, decorated by day and
illuminated by night. Clement May, formerly
well known in Ballarat and in Maoriland,
but now settled in Adelaide as dramatic
coach, has given a successful evening of
Dickens and other impersonations; and
Edward Reeves has weighed in with his
usual, seasonable “Christmas Carol.” At
the Tivoli are the jovial Florence Baines,
Bert Bilton as piano-entertainer, and the
sisters Macarte, mildly pretty as Japs, but
effective when walking a wire. John Fuller
has brought his tenor voice back to the
King’s “after an absence of 20 years,” and
it is still in good working order. Wonder-
graph has worked off its beauty competi-
tion, the winner getting the handsome testi-
monial to her good looks of 17 guineas. It

is now going to the Pole, or thereabouts,
with Captain Scott. West’s rely mainly on
Rip Van Winkle, and the Empire on a horse-
drama. Of concerts, many and good, those
of the Orpheus (100th appearance) and the
University Conservatorium are most notable.
Twenty feet of land, short one inch, in
Swanston-street, Melbourne, has just been
sold for £23,500, or at the rate of £1175
per foot —the record price for Swanston-
street. The allotment is opposite St. Paul’s
Cathedral, and is occupied by a cafe, for
which the tenant pays £lOOO a year and
taxes. On November 1, 1837, at Melbourne’s
second land sale, John Batman and Thomas
Winter gave £173 for the whole of the
frontage between Flinders-street and Flin-
ders-lane, with a depth of two chains. About
the spot where the just-disposed of cafe
stands, the big business of John Connell
and Co. was founded by John Connell in
1853. A picture is still extant of the very
modest, premises—a two-storeyed building,
with one window,' illuminated with the
Royal Arms and the intimation that the
proprietor was the specially appointed grocer
to Governor Latrobe.
“Stargazer” : Melbourne playgoers who take delight
in the literary drama have reason to be much obliged
to the Repertory Club, which makes Gregan
McMahon’s quarterly seasons possible ; but this feel-
ing is producing rather mushy criticism. “Super-
man” was spoken of as a masterly performance, leav-
ing nothing to demand. Truth to tell, it was miles
short of that, and is only to be •commended as the
best possible in the circumstances. It means some-
thing attempted, something done; but to applaud
it as everything gives the judicious patron a stiff
neck. The Repertory Theatre is a new and deserving
movement, and an honest one ; and in the name of Art
and common-sense let us give it honest criticism.
The effort is to beat away from commercialism, yet
the notices all read like a succession of puff para-
graphs. Let the honesty extend to Repertory criti-
cism, too, though the galled jade wince. No char-
acter in “Superman” was excellently done,' and one
was done so foolishly as to call for unanimous pro-
test. It would have been better to have had, Hector
Malone played by. a phonograph—or even a Jew’s
harp.
From London: George Rignold and the Rev. George
Walters, who collaborated on “Joseph in Egypt,” may
be interested to hear that a Mrs. Percy Dearmer
has written what she calls a “poetic drama”
on the same subject and with the same title.
It was to have been produced for the first time on
November 28, with Henrietta Watson, Otho Stuart,
Harcourt Williams and Robert Farquharson in the
east. The prison scene is to be “an exact reproduc-
tion of a room in one of the pyramids.” George
Rignold’s play had a run in Sydney and Melbourne,
but when he brought it to London the Lord Chamber-
lain refused to give it a license, and so its produc-
tion was barred. Present writer, who was in the
House of Commons, asked for reasons why, and the
then Home Secretary, Sir Matthew White Ridley, re-
plied that it was the “invariable practice” not to
license any drama derived wholly, or in part, from
Biblical sources. But the practice has been modified
during the last few years. Saint Saens’s “Samson
and Delilah,” after having been barred for a long
time, is now permitted, and draws large crowds to
Covent Garden. And several thinly-disguised Scrip-
tural dramas have also been licensed, so that if the
play were brought to London now, it would probably
get a hospitable reception.
EXIT GEORGE RIGNOLD.
In the first hours of the week the curtain
fell on George Rignold, the most picturesque
figure the Australian stage ever saw. Of a
Huguenot family (the name was Rignald
originally, but changed to Rignold by a prin-
ter’s error), his father was an actor and his
mother, Patience Blaxland, a star stock-
actress, noted for her performances in “Ham-
let” and “Virginius.” The two sons of this
union, George and William, were, in boy-
hood, orchestral players, first and second
violins respectively ; but they were trained iu
elocution by their par-
ents, had the run of
the stage from baby-
hood, and were “handy
men” from an early
age. George actually
managed a circuit the-
atre (Wolverhamp-
ton) for his father
when he was 14 years
of age, and in addi-
tion to the cares of
management, was
crossed with hopeless
love for Marie Wilton
(now Lady Squire
Bancroft), who was
playing “The Little
Asmodeus” at his
father’s theatre. After
experience as a second
violin in Dublin (where
he nearly died of ty-
phoid fever, and saw
the home-coming of
the Crimean War vet-
erans), he returned to
his parents’ place in
Birmingham, and got
a chance as “utility”
in Mercer Simpson’s
theatre, with provisos
in his contract that
he was “not to object
to go on in crowds,
and to play in the
orchestra when re-
quired.”
The brothers, Wil-
liam and George, grew
to handsome youth
and maturity, and
were passed on to
James Henry Chute’s
famous Bath and Bris-
tol circuit, where they
were contemporaries of a galaxy of youthful
geniuses, such as the Terrys (Ellen, Kate
and Marion), Madge Robertson (Mrs. Ken-
dall), Henrietta Hodson (afterwards Mrs.
Henry Labouchere, and aunt of our George
Musgrove), Tom Robertson (author of
“Caste”), Charlie Coglilan and others. This
circuit was the conduit pipe to London, and
Tom Taylor took George Rignold up to play
in his “Sense and Sensation” —a failure.
Back to the provinces, George Rignold lived
the hard, red-herring life of the provincial
actor, married a charming actress, Miss
Marie Braybrook Henderson (known in Aus-
tralia as “chorus” in “Henry V.”), and got
to London again with Labouchere at the
Queen’s Theatre, Longacre. Here he played
obscure parts, till the famous stage mana-
ger, “Jack” Ryder, “discovered” him and
made him the star in such parts as Glaucus,
in “The Last Days of Pompeii,” Romeo,
Caliban (a sensational performance, which
gained him great fame in London), Colonel
Challis, Amos Clark, Cromwell, and Claude
Melnotte (that and Romeo to the famous
Adelaide Neilson). When Bateman failed at
the Lyceum, with his daughter as star and
Henry Irving as support, Rignold was offered
Irving’s place, but refused it on the advice
of Labouchere and Ryder.
In 1875 he was engaged to tour the
United States in “Henry V.,” and captured
the Americans from the jump. He became
a “matinee idol,” and shared the devotion of
New York Society women with Harry Mon-
tague, another English actor. Pactions were
formed, with floral emblems —roses and vio-
lets. He twice toured the United States, and
came on to Australia on both occasions.
After the first Australian tour an Adelaide
syndicate was formed to put Rignold into
Drury Lane in “Henry V.” The season was
a huge success. His “Henry V.” was thus
the rage in three continents. It is still the
standard.
On his second visit to Australia he opened
Her Majesty’s Theatre, Sydney, and gave
Australians many fine productions, Shak-
spearian and otherwise, including Gilbert
Parker’s “Faust” version, and the Rev. Geo.
Walters’s “Joseph of Canaan.” His Othello.
Henry V., Marc Antony, Paolo Macari and
Master Ford are most remembered. His last
appearance in drama was three years ago
in Melbourne in Hall Caine’s “Bondman,”
and his last stage appearance was at the
Titheradge matinee, a year ago.
Rignold was greatly respected by the play-
going public, and loved and esteemed by his
friends. He was one of the most hospitable
of men, and frequently entertained visiting
celebrities at his home, Braybrook, Middle
Some years after his first wife’s
death he married Miss Coppin, daughter of
the late George Coppin, comedian and poli-
tician. She also predeceased him. He was
an unequalled stage manager, a most enter-
taining companion, a ripe Shakspearian
scholar, with a phenomenal memory for fine
poetry, and a clever raconteur—on the
whole, a man of wisdom and personal mag-
netism. He never neglected to “lift a lame
dog over a style,” if he could, and his char-
ities were widespread. No more genial,
kindly, unspoiled human being ever lived.
And possibly no one who ever came on earth
had a better time or a happier life.

From an educational point of view, the idea is all
right. To fit your conversational step to those of

choose topics which may be dealt with m 10
minutes or less—these are things that call for some
brushing of brains. Truly the times are strenuous.
“Looking Backward” : The alleged at-
tempted invasion of Australia, in 1813, men-
tioned and inquired about by “Kuscobin”
(B. 5/12/T2), is a myth. While Jorgen
Jorgensen was imprisoned at the hulk at
Chatham, he is said to have learned of the
projected invasion from a Count Dillon.
This Count was a Frenchman, and a fellow
prisoner. Jorgensen’s story to the Foreign
Office was that Dillon had revealed to him
the plot between France and the United
States. The Government reckoned that
Jorgensen was lving. and had invented the
yarn in order to gain his liberty as a reward.
But, as a spy was wanted, Jorgensen got
the billet, which he kept until he gambled
himself out of it. It was in 1826, some
years after this, that the ex-Iving of Den-
mark was transported to Van Diemen’s
Land. Whaling was then in full swing.
When Jorgensen wrote an account of his
adventures, he invented the story about the
looting and sinking of 17 whalers off the coast
of V.D.L. in 1813, his object being to bol-
ster up the yarn he had spun to the Foreign
Office. There was no invasion, and no
attempt. No whalers were sunk. I doubt
very much whether, in 1813, the island had
anything like a total of 17 whaling craft.
It was not till 1816 that the fishing started
on any scale in Frederick Hendry Bay. Jor-
gensen quotes the record price of oil in
London in 1813 as being the result of the
invasion. The fact is that it had been
going up for years, as the demand for light-
ing oil increased. But about this time gas
began to be generally used, and the demand
decreased, and went on decreasing for about
HO years. So much for the invasion. About
the adventurer himself, he wrote a little heap
of books, including “The Religion of Christ
the Religion of Nature.” This was written
in the intervals of spying and gambling on
the Continent. While in Hobart Town he
became editor of “a colonial newspaper,” but
the proprietor insisted that everyone in the
house should attend prayers three times a
jay. “Those prayers,” says Jorgensen,
“were unusually long, and delivered in a
tone and dialect extremely disagreeable.
They proved too much even for the author
of “The Religion of Christ the Religion
of Nature,” and he left. Late in life he
married a lady who was somewhat of a
heroine in the campaign against the bush-
rangers. This venture was one of the most
disastrous of Jorgensen’s undertakings. It
is said that the Conqueror of Iceland was
“often seen flying from her fury through the
streets.”
Those misguided enthusiasts who rush
about the country administering medals for
life-saving will be sore put to it when they
come to reward those concerned in a recent
Riverina tragedy. The trouble commenced
with what looks like the attempt of a young
girl to commit suicide in the waters of the
Murrumbidgee. Finding the immersion
colder than she bargained for, she cried, for
help, when, according to the press and police
reports, a brave young mantnamed) plunged
in and rescued her. The following issue of
the local rag, however, contained two indig-
nant epistles from two other people, who
each claimed to be the sole hero. The cor-
respondence has since been warmed up by
a report from the original hero, along with
the comments and descriptions of eyewit-
nesses. So far, the only person who re-
mains quite calm and perfectly sane is the
damsel, and she preserves a taciturn silence
on the whole episode. Meantime the busi-
ness is giving rise to domestic dissensions
and street rows ; and a police court prosecu-
tion over an alleged breach of the peace pro-
mises to add a Gilbertian finale to the play.

Another testimonial offered to the Jap,
this time in his capacity of ally. It is from
the lately-published private diary and jour-
nal of Melton Trior, long-time war corres-
pondent for the Illustrated London
News :
And these people (the Japs) are our allies! Of
course there are gentlemen among them, but my ex-
perience tells me they are smiling, deceitful liars. I
am angry at the insults offered me. I am an Eng-
lishman and their ally. In all my campaigning ex-
perience of 25 wars, never have I had such indig-
nities and insults thrown at me as I have in Japan.
Rabbi Cohen, speaking recently at the Syd-
ney Synagogue, is reported to have “severely
reprimanded Australians for their derision
of the Asiatic races. He hinted that it was
a confession of inferiority, as showing that
we were secretly afraid.” So far as The
Bulletin is concerned, it doesn’t deride the
Eastern Asiatic, races. It simply says that
the ways of Asia are not the ways of Aus-
tralia, that its morals are not ours ; and, be-
lieving that the white man’s ways and
morals are the better, it is going to unceas-
ingly struggle to keep the two races anart.
The’ Jap’s ways and morals may be right,
and the Australian’s may be wrong, just as
the Christian may be right and the Jew
wrong; but that probably doesn’t alter the
fact that Rabbi Cohen would rather lose an
eye than be a party to the union of a Jew
and a Gentile under one roof.
Adelaide has had an unusual sort of per-
jury case the accused being Asker, a big,
popular constable. During the burglar scare
last June, he brought in a sleepy peison
whom he had caught, he said, making a hole
in . warehouse door. There were two of the
desperadoes, but one had escaped. Ihe
policemen at the watch-house noticed that
the prisoner seemed rather tipsv for burg-
ling ; also the alleged burglary-outfit brought
PLANS AND SPECIFICATIONS.
THE NEW MAYOR OF MOOKI: “Now I want you t' paint me life-size all exceptin' me
ear's and me nose. Make them three-quarter .”
in with him seemed hardly up to the job, and,
finally, another constable dropped in and said
he had not many minutes before stirred the
identical drunk from a heavy sleep in a
lane round the corner. Straightway the
whole fotce, instead of standing by Asker,
began to work in the interests of what seemed
to them to be justice. The matter went on
so far that Asker swore to his statements;
then the Crown dropped it, awkward ques-
tions began to be a sued, and Asker cleared
out. After that, it was merely a question ot
time to bring him back and give him four
years for perjury. It was a rotten was to
trv to earn glory? and promotion, of course ;
but what show would the harmless drunk
have had in (say) Chicago?
“De Yid”: “Haresfoot” (B. 21/11/’l2)
speaks of the good humor of the Jews con-
cerning caricatures of themselves on the
stage The Jew is able to laugh against his
collective self because he has a rare
sense of humor. But, all the same,
he is subconsciously proud ot being
a Yahid. The female of his
species, however, when young, is
generally foolishly ashamed ot her
ancient race. She grins frantically
at any old skit on Abraham s pro-
geny and the most brutal repre-
sentation of Shylock has her entire
approval in public. But in middle-
age she becomes rabidly and ag-
gressively Hebraic- —far more so
than the man. Still, when all s
said, only one thing annoys the .
Hebrew —any Hebrew —more than being
taken for one; and that’s to be mistaken
for anything else.

“Undergrad”: This question was* asked
in the 4th year Laws Exam, at Melbourne
Uni. (Procedure and Evidence paper)
State, with reasons, your opinion as to the admis-
sibility of the evidence in the following case. On a
trial for murder, the deceased, with her throat cut,
came suddenly out of a room m which she left the
prisoner, and said something immediately alter
coming out of the room shortly before she died.
I guess evidence of that robust chaiactei
simply couldn’t be choked off. _ Imagine
Madden, C.J., and a panic-stricken jury
watching the deceased female bouncing out
of .the jury room (there’s no other room
about the court that I know of, although
why the prisoner would be in there I don t
know), and yelling out: “He’s cut me
throat,” just before dying a second time.
Gosh, what a trial scene! I understand
George Marlow and William Anderson are
going to toss up for it.
About the most severe thing ever said
about the S. M. Herald was printed in the
old paper’s own In Memoriam column the
other day (7/12/T2) :• —
In loving memory of my dear husband and- our
father, William (say) McSmitli, who departed this
life Dee. 7th, 189 S, aged 29 years. For many years
employed on the Sydney Morning Herald staff. Lord
have mercy on his soul.
However, Mr. James has, at least, the com-
pensation of learning that the Deity sub-
scribes to the Herald.
“Hamer”: Unionism has grown during
the last few years like the public debt, and
the Sydney Trades Hall is its monument.
HE KNEW HER WEAKNESS.
YVONNE: “ Dora's husband allows her a pound a
week as pin money. ”
LETTY: “ Well, it's none
too much—she never
sews a button on any-
thing."
Twenty-four years ago the first hall was
built, a single-storey affair, with five or six
rooms and a dismal outlook on Dixon-street.
Some years later the beginnings of a new
hall arrived, and answered fairly well until
four or five years ago; then the clatter
of newly-born and growing unions demand-
ing accommodation necessitated the comple-
tion of a wing along Goulburn-street. Even
that is not sufficient, however, and a simi-
lar wing along Dixon-street is now being
fledged. Four storeys high, with about 50
good-sized rooms and two big halls, the hall
marks the growth of unionism in a manner
calculated to make the selfish Tory weep.
It is a pity that the old hall could not have
been preserved as a relic, but it had to
make way for the improvements. The hall,
by the way, also illustrates the growth of
industry under Protection, for most of the
new unions which have demanded the. in-
creased space are the outcome of the birth
of new industries, since something resem-
bling a tariff came into force.

“G.V.W.” from across the Tasman Sea:
The arch blunderers of the Waihi (M.L.) strike fiasco
(Semple, Web’#. Glover and a few others) eclipsed
even Coyne, of Brisbane strike notoriety. Like most
strikes, the one in Northern Maoriland (against a
gold mine, of all things) was doomed to failure from
the start, and had there been any sense in the miners’
executive it would never have been started. When
it was started, financial weakijess forbade the calling
out of the whole Federation, and for seven months
there was maintained a sectional strike, which, for
four years previously , the hysterical and futile red-ray
advisers had denounced as suicidal. Tired of the miser-
able business, several unions have withdrawn from the
Federation, and at time of writing that body looks
as if it had just crawled out of a threshing machine.
Various trades and labor organisations in Australasia
have been bled to the tune of £30,000, and all I can
see for it are about 400 miners employed in watching
others who have taken their jobs. It is a trifle
expensive at that. Had the money been expended in
organising for next general elections and in establish-
ing a sound weekly newspaper for all workers, mental
as well as manual, it would have proved a powerful
lever in getting Labor off the rocks. As things stand,
Labor in M.L. appears likely to remain on the rocks
until blown off with gun-cotton.
SHE: “ Father says we must break off our en-
gagement.”
HE: “But why, dear?”
SHE: “Well, it's a month since we were en-
gaged, and you haven't given me a ring yet.”
HE: “But that’s your fathers fault. His
name's not good enough at the jeweller's to
help me get credit.”
NOTHING IN HIM BUT DOTH
CHANGE.
"Have you lost that beautiful little kitten you
had, the last time I was here?”
“ Nope .”
"Did it die? ”
“Nope."
“What happened to it, then?”
“It growed into a cat.”
Melbourne papers tell the stirring story of
a patient who made a break from a private
mental hospital in a little short shirt; but
they jibbed at the incident of his evening’s
adventure. He was getting over the north
wall in his little short shirt, when an ener-
getic nurse swung on to him, and tore away
the most elfective portion of an already brief
item, leaving the poor wretch possessed of
nothing in which to face a censorious world
but a slight rag round the shoulders. In
this state he arrived at a professional man’s
front door, and knocked in frenzy with one
hand, while ringing madly and incoherently
with the other. Before the attendant who
opened the door to the excited caller had
time to go into convulsive hysterics, she
heard the undraped visitor say: “For mercy’s
sake, madam, lend me your hose; I’m on
fire!” It was the escapee’s fixed opinion
that he had been burning for seven days and
was wholly uninsured.
From the Oldest Inhabitant: —
Another bit of old Sydney is marked for imme-
diate demolition. This bit consists of three shops in
King-street, near George-street. The site' formed
part of the original “Moore corner,” on which, in
1799, Anthony Fenn-Kemp, of the old Rum Corps,
lived and “trucked,” he being one of the officers
who carried on a storekeeping business while in the
army service. A sergeant of the corps, after Kemp
went to England re the court-martial on Colonel
Johnston, sold the allotment for £5O. \V. H.
Moore, Crown Solicitor, came into possession'under
the quit-rent system ; but early in the ’3o’s his quit-
rent was commuted for a cash payment of about
£6O. Moore had the land surveyed and cut up into
12 allotments, which, being sold by Sam Lyons, the
auctioneer, in 1834, brought the tidy sum of
£10,318. Some of the shops now to be demolished
were built before John Batman had visited Port
Phillip, and before John Pascoe Fawkner had built
his mud hut on the banks of the Yarra. Another
ancient building, in what in early days was known
as Upper Pitt-street, has just been demolished. In
the 40’s of last century it was occupied as a school-
room by Mr. J. H. Rucker, who therein birched
many notables—among them D. H. Deniehy, John
Bennett, James Fairfax and G. R. Dibbs.
“Bull Ant”: It’s my trade, and I’m afraid
(or glad—you can have it either way) that
I look at everything with on eye to the
defence of our continent home. And this
is what I find in a senior cadet co. in one
Cow district of N.S. Wales. No! 1 cannot
open his hands to their full extent; No. 2
cannot extend either arm from the shoulder
and face the front at the same time; No. 3
could not, if he were offered a field-marshal’s
baton, bring his knees into a proper align-
ment with thg rest of his body. You may
possibly think these defects due to natural
causes, but Cow is, to my positive know-
ledge, the one and only cause. Perhaps
the Peace Society cranks, when they read
this, may see some good in compulsory
training, even if it only gets the lads away
from the devastating animal for a few hours
a month.
“De Yid”: A standard of honor is a
wobblesome article. I set one up the other
day, and a Dane breathed heavily on it and
it fell. He was telling me of a typical
fo’c’sle-head fight. “Id was a mix-up,” he
said, “and den dat Norwegian shap I tole
you ’bout he drew a knife —on a nigger, too
—an’ our shaps sailed in an’ dere was
merryell for ’bout 10 minute.” I looked up
at the six-feet-and-something-over Viking be-
side me and pictured the rough-and-tumble
with an unholy joy. “Suppose you drew
your knife, too,” I suggested, to encourage
him in his narrative. His blue eyes, with
the Northern ice-glint in them, flashed re-
proof down at me. “Nevare,” he said.
Then, with emphasising forefinger—“Dat’s
a d —d rotten Norwegian trick, dat is. I
would’n’ draw a knife for annyding.” And
then he set up his standard. “I cracked
two of dere heads open wit’ a bottle,” he
told me, simply and very seriouslw
“I slander”: The
cattle trade between
King Island (Tas.)
and the mainland is
large and growing.
On one trip of the ves-
sel which does practi-
cally all the trade, the
writer was a passen-
ger. There was a full
load of store cattle in
the hold and on deck,
packed as tight as the
sardines you may have
heard of. Heavy
weather was encoun-
tered and the vessel
took four days to do a
passage which in or-
dinary circumstances
would have taken only
18 hours. During
these four days the
animals did not have
a drop of, water to
drink. On arrival in
port four of the poor
beasts were dead,
others were at their
!a»st gasp, and many,
on being landed on to
the wharf, could
scar c e ly move, s o
weakened were they
b y their sufferings.
On another occasion I
saw slung into a
steamer, at Ki ng
Island, a cow that had
broken one of its legs.
The animal was tied
to a stanchion in the
hold of the vessel, to
be jostled and knocked
about by the other
cattle. Such cruelty
is scarcely credible; but then kindness or
consideration of any sort is not one of the
shining virtues of the average cow-dealer or
shipper.

Australia’s Pie Commissioner keeps up
George Greid’s best traditions in Canada
and the United States. The most interest-
ing remarks he made in a recent report to
Minister for External Affairs Thomas on
his visit to those countries were:—
Arrived in Chicago on the morning of the 11th
ultimo, I was that day entertained by the Merchants’
Association at luncheon (1), next day at a dinner
(2) given by the British Empire Association, and on
the following day by the Press Club at luncheon
(3) ... .Proceeding to New York, I was the guest at
a luncheon (4) given by the Merchants’ Association,
and at a dinner (5) given by the chairman of the
Anglo-American Committee arranging for the cele-
THE MAIN CHANCE.

bration of the Hundred Years of Peace. .. .1 went next
to 805t0n.... The summer residence of President Taft
is not many miles away, and he was there. I met
him at luncheon (6)... .Returned to New York....
delivered two addresses, preceded in each case by a
most hospitable entertainment (7 and 8).... 0n the
3rd I was entertained (9) by the Chamber of
Commerce, and on the 4th the Director-General of
the Pan-American Union invited a number to meet
me at dinner (10)....0n the 7th I was the guest
of the Pilgrims of the United States at luncheon
(11) at the Waldorf Astoria Hotel. .. .In the evening
I was the guest of the Canadian Club (12).
But the most admirable remark in Gorge’s
report is this: “ Those who cannot take their
attention from the culinary aspect of the
matter see in these habits room for ridi-
cule.” By a printer’s error, no doubt, the
words, “loud and prolonged applause,” have
been omitted at the close of the sentence.
S.S.M. : Last month the Department
arranged a conference of commanding officers
of the militia infantry regiments, the idea
being to find out the weak points disclosed
by time and experience in the Comonwealth
Defence scheme. The conference met,
talked, and then put forth its suggestions,
some of which flabbergasted all practical
soldiers. Take two :
No. 1. Box spurs to be taken into wear again.
I wonder how the Jap laughed at this sug-
gestion, coming from a conference of com-
manding officers, met together to fix up the
weaknesses of a very slack Defence scheme.
No. 2. The Service shirt to be abolished.
I have had seven years in the Force, and
have done a little “gravel-crushing” in the
various States in that time, and I know
which uniform I prefer for field work. For
comfort there is no comparison between the
old tight tunic and the present loose, com-
fortable shirt. In marching, especially on a
typical Australian country road during any
old summer s day, a soldier got very little
comfort from the old-pattern uniform —stiff
collar, tight sleeves, tight other things. But
in the present-pattern uniform, with its soft
woollen collar, there is none of the old
agony. Roll the sleeves up, undo the neck,
and you feel as though you could do a bit for
your country. The secret of the whole
trouble is that the new uniform does not
look showy enough on the militia officer. He-
(or some of him) cannot stand being in a
plain drab uniform, especially when the per-
manent forces turn out in a dream of red!,
yellow or blue. With compulsory service the-
days of pretty soldiering are over, and the
heads should wake up to the fact. I am a
permanent soldier, and I know that, on a
warm day in Vic., I envv the men I have to
instruct, when I am wearing a stiff cotton
tunic, while they don the shirt that the
millinery bosses want to supersede.

The annual report of Victoria’s Indeter-
minate Sentences Board makes unsatisfactory
reading, chiefly because of the Government’s
apparent lack of interest in the matter. The
necessary authorising Act was passed over
two years ago, and a Board was appointed—
and that is about all. Seasoned indetermin-
ates are confined in Pentridge, where they do
little good for themselves and less for others,
and juveniles are held (till they escape) in
Castlemaine gaol. There is no reformatory,,
no farm, no effort to employ the probationers-,
at reproductive work, no genuine attempt to.
fit them for the uphill struggle that awaits:
them. The Board just does what it can for-
them, and gives them a chance as it thinks:
advisable. Of the 106 persons who have
come under control 22 have been released on
probation—l 9 juveniles and three old offend-
ers;—while seven were released without the-
Board being consulted, i.e., by the Governor
in Council, which probably means that some'
persons have been pulling strings. Of the-
63 who have come under the Probationary
Officers’ regard—including 39 committed
direct from Children’s and other Courts —24
had proved themselves well-behaved, and are
now wholly free, 26 are still being tested,,
seven have been reconvicted and returned to.
gaol, and six have passed out of sight.

What the kirk wants is “energetic, enthusiastic,
highly-trained young clergymen, with plenty of com-
mon-sense, men who will not encumber themselves by
marrying early.”— Professor Rentoul (Melb.).
He was a little parson man ;
He wore a. little hat,
Which, like his coat, was black and tan,
And also stale and flat —
In which it bore a semblance to
The sermons that he made.
He had a fam'ly, not a few —-
In fact it might be called a crew.
There were some twins ; he hardly knew
How many, I’m afraid.
He had a little, tired wife,
A dusty little church,
And made an endless fight, but life
Had left him in the lurch.
The husband’s and the father’s roles
With him had greatest weight.
His time was spent in chasing doles,
In quest of clothes, and grub, and coals.
He’d left the saving of old souls
These new ones to create.
The grim Professor sniffed, and glared
Upon the crowding kids.
“And this is how* your work’s impaired I
And thus your light is hid!
For shame!” he said. “You are in debt!
Most grievously you err
Encumbrances like these to net.”
Then said the little parson : “Yet
This is the surest way to get
A congregation, sir.”

NABOB BOOT PASTE,
the Waterproof
Boot Polish.
ONE APPLICATION WILL LAST A WEEK, A BRUSH UP
BEING ALL THAT IS NECESSARY IN BETWEEN WHILES.
LEWIS Jc WHITTY, Makers, Melbourne and Sydney. tl
ABORIGIN-
ALITIES
“Kimbolton”: The combo {Combo Aus-
tralis) is to be found anywhere between Burketown
and Broome. There are many species of combos,
but they may be roughly divided into two classes.
Class I. has no home hut the bush, scorns the yoke
of servitude, and obeys no laws, not even Nature’s.
Brumby-trappers, buffalo-shooters, gold-fossickers,
copper-gougers and tin-scratehers are to be found in
this class. Dry-shellers (men who gather pearl-
shell at low tides), beehe-de-mer fishers and beach-
combers in general are ruled out. The beach-combing
combo pigs-in with Malays, Javanese and Chows,
and is a person to be avoided or destroyed. The
brumby-trapping combo generally has a “turn-out,”
two or three saddle-hacks, and some pack-horses.
He mostly woos his lady after the fashion of the
old raiders of the Scottish borders. A few buy
their brides, the same as folk in civilised countries,
but these are in a minority, and are generally hen-
pecked. A strong arm is held in respect by all
primitive people; and, anyway, women like being cap-
tured. A trip once, maybe twice, a year to some
“settlement,” like Pine Creek or Borroloola, is the
extent of his experience of civilisation. He does
not go in, like most back-country men, and start on
a coruscating jag. The horses must be attended to
or they stray, and out-back publicans are notoriously
sympathetic towards horses afflicted with wanderlust.
Being experienced, the combo gets his order made
up as quickly as the storekeeping publican can be
induced to do it, straps on a couple of cases of
whisky, or whatever liquid sunshine his immature
soul hankers for, and makes for some secluded water-
hole, where he and the darling of his heart can enjoy
their jamboree, secure from the rapacity of the bush
Bung. Class 11., the wages combo, is an altogether
different type. He mostly 'works on cattle or sheep
stations, or drives a team on the roads. Sometimes —
if he is a cattle man, pretty often —he has a couple
of horses, but generally he travels per boot. Writer
once camped near a couple of these combos at
Fitzroy Crossing." A feeling of coldness was notice-
able in the publican, a sure sign that their spree was
tapering off. They started discussing jobs. “Hear
they want a man at Gol-Lol,” I said. “Lasy place
to work.” “Aw, yes, but the boss keeps all the
young gins ’round the house.” Gol-Lol was turned
down” the boss evidently being a fellow-combo and
a monopolist. “They’re puttin’ on men at Balla-
warry.” “Yes,” interestedly, “I wuz up there one
year. Gins not bad there. But wages is not too
good; tucker either.” Ballawarry held over for
further consideration. I happened to pass through
Ballawarry a few weeks later, and saw a large, red
man, evidently the boss, despatching four white men
to a distant part of the run, yard-building. Ten or
12 buxom gins, squatting in the shade near by, were
interestedly watching proceedings. After the usual
amount of profanity the dray was loaded, and the boss
turned to the young fellow in charge of the party.
“Now, sure you’ve got everything?” “Yes, I think
so.” “Well, how many women are you going to take?”
“Oh,” said the young chap shamefacedly, “I don’t
want any women.” He must have been a new hand
in the North. “Nonsense,” said the boss impatiently.
“Here Judy, Nelly, Maggie, Polly, you go out
alonga this one white fellow.” Turning to me, as
the cavalcade moved off with the hastily selected
brides following, he said: “They’re handy about the
camp in the bush. And, besides, they keep the men
more contented.” Which they do.

“D.L.M.”: Permit me to say a word on
the Dawson River (G.Q.) barramundi. Strange as it
may seem, this fresh-water fish belongs solely to the
Dawson. It can be found in no other river in the
world, and, despite all efforts, has obstinately re-
fused to thrive when transferred to other waters.
Barramundi weighs anything up to 101 b., often mea-
sures 2ft. 6ip- in length, and his body is decorated
with scales of various hues rivalling in splendor
those of the wild rainbow. He makes a most delici-
ous dish, but is difficult to entice ashore. Some
fishermen secure him with a piece of red cloth at-
tached to the hook and drawn along the surface.
Others pass the hook through the skin of a frog’s
back in such a manner as not to prevent greenback
from swimming. Another plan is to tie three hooks
back to back with a small bait on each. When the
river is flooded barramundi follows the clear water
up the creeks and gullies, where he may easily be
taken with a short net. While the river is low and
the water clear you can see shoals of this beautiful
fish paddling gracefully within three inches of the
surface.
TWO OF A TRADE.
SIGNOR HURDI DE GURD : “ Grazia! One
penny! Times are indeed bad with us
musicians!"
Gouger .. Ever seen the crows after
P°or bunny? I’ve often watched them cruising along
tb e hig wire netting fences on the great plains,
their strong wings beating rhythmically, little black
e Y es searching the long dry grass beneath them, all
silent, until one made the single remark, “Quark!”
Which simply meant that he had seen a rabbit
crouching under a tuft of grass near the fence,
Then down would come the crows, and sit in a
bri ef council on the tops of the posts. Everything
arranged, up in the air again was the command,
while one made a single, vicious swoop straight at
bunny. Of course he left cover and made for
the open plain. The crows were after him in an
instant, swooping and striking with beak, claw
and wings. Usually, bunny can’t stand the buffet-
ing for long, and he makes back straight along
the fence, and, once there, the crows keep him
going, flying a few feet overhead and occasionally
making, a vicious sweep from the rear, until the
quarry is run into a corner. Then the real execution
commences, the black brutes swooping at him from
all points, striking and tearing and flapping the
little chap’s face with their strong wings. I have
seen the rabbit get so numbed and cowed that he
would crawl right up into the corner as far as he
could, and lie there flat, trying to bury his head
in the loam out of reach of his foes. After that
his fate was mighty sudden. The crows would
settle on the fence, while one of their number flew
a little above ground, and then dropped with one
straight, terrific swoop for the back of bunny’s
head. In every case where I conducted a post-
mortem I found that deceased had been pierced
clean through the skull to the brain by a single
blow from a crow’s strong bill.
THE RETORT OBVIOUS.
HE: “Bai Jove! Meg, I’ve just thought of something awfully good. As you stand there
you remind me of a charming actress. Now, who do you think
SHE (promptly): “Oh, Margaret Attglin’, I suppose."
“Splodger” on temperaments :
David came from the Flying Angel Push in Mel-
bourne, and lobbed on to the rabbit-proof fence when
it was going through Lake Nabbaroo (W.A.). They
made him oft'-sider to a camel-puncher named Jim.
lie had had no experience with smellers; but he took
to the .job like beer. Tiger, the man-killer, was in
his team. Tiger killed a ’Ghan and tore the arm off
another, so was traded off to the Government as a
treasure. What eventually became of him I don’t
i know, though I heard he was shot as useless; but all
the time I was on the fence he knocked about with
Dave. I’ve seen Dave driving him in a dray on his
lonesome. Dave had the camel temperament.
Old George had the bullock temperament. The
senior teamster had the pick of the bunch, and left
George the no-goods. George never swore, hit, or
ill-used his bullocks, but somehow his team always
led the way. Half his time he was pulling the other
team out of creeks and mud-holes, and then he got
home an hour or so before the other bloke. They
changed about. George then started to get home a
dav in front of Jack. I’ve seen him bail up and
milk a cow that no one else could go near. This
same cow nearly killed a man one day, and would
have finished the job if George hadn’t mildly shooed
her off. I know this of my own knowledge. I was
the man. Yet George could do nothing with horses.
A mad bloke near Springsure (Central Queensland)
got the loan from Fernlea station of eight unbroken
horses. He shoved them into a waggon straight away,
took them down to the line, and brought back a load
of flour without accident. The Nagoore was a banker
at the time, and that made tucker short. The mad
bloke took his excursion quite as a matter of course.
He owned the horse temperament.
I saw a lad of about 20 (he had one leg shorter
than the other, and was very lop-sided) go into a
stockyard near Bloomsbury (N.Q.), bridle, saddle and
mount an unbroken horse, and then ride away with the
musterers.
Personally, I have not got the horse temperament.
Some horses have an aversion for me that I cannot
understand. I never was cruel to a horse in my life,
and I’ve had charge of stables and handled all sorts.
Strange to say, black horses that show the whites
of their eyes take a particular antipathy to me with-
out any apparent reason. The last one of this kind
was good enough to break my leg with a kick while
I was taking his hobbles off. I prefer camels; we
always get along peacefully.
And there are men with the motor-car tempera-
ment in the cities, aren’t there —fellows that can
coax the racketty things to do almost anything.
* * * *
“Reka”: The traveller who wanders on
the Fiji beaches in soulful meditation is apt to
pause abruptly under the impression he is seeing
things when he suddenly perceives all round him
shells of every size, age, color and pattern sauntering
casually over the sands. The first time these ap-
paritions stalked before me I suspected the tropical
sun of having used me unkindly, and sat feebly
on the nearest rock to recover. It was on the
beach at Naitonitoni (Navau), and as far as
eye could see the shell population was strolling over
the countryside. Suddenly along came the head of
a china doll, strutting by with the shells with an
uncannily human air about it. I picked it up to
investigate and two sharp pincers snapped savagely
at me, as the fierce inmate defended his home. He
was a hermit crab, who had mistaken the doll’s
head for a new and roomy kind of shell. This crab
makes its home in the empty shell, grows in and
fills the cavity, and roams the beaches in search
of food, with his house on his back. Later on I
met some more crabs which had chosen even more
curious places to reside in. One walked about with
a small teapot for a roof, and I reckon that a full-
dress parade of hermit crabs who have had the
run of a marine rubbish tip would beat a pantomime
display.
“Moona” : Before the curlew migrates from
the “Abo.” page, lemme relate, a few facts about him.
For the last 15 years a pair have spent six months
each 3'ear in one spot in this district (Watchem,
Vic.). I’ll not swear it is the same t\v<f; but, any-
way, year after year, one pair and no more put in an
appearance about September and depart towards
March. I have searched for and several times found
their eggs (I won't say nests, because they haven’t
any), but have only twice seen the young. One [
took home and put in a chicken coop ; but the blood-
curdling wails it emitted all night induced me to re-
turn it next day. When anyone approaches the spot
where the eggs are, the birds dart off in opposite
directions; and when the supposed danger is past,
they dart back again in stages of about a chain at a
time.
ANOTHER LAND SCANDAL.
YOUNG H OPEFULL: “ What did father mean
when he said to Mr. Way lack that he'd got
a good figure?”
MAMMA HOPEFUL: “Oh, he meant he'd got a
good price for that paddock he sold."
Y.H. (reflectively): “Urn! Has cook been sell-
ing some land, too?"
“J.T.8.”: “Yarrurn’s” statement (B.
7/11/’l2) that the curlew doesn’t build a nest is
quite correct; but when he mentions that Mrs. C.
doesn’t hatch her own eggs, leaving that job to
the sun, he is talking through his panama. The
writer has seen dozens of curlews sitting on their
eggs. The mother bird carries out this wifely duty
while her lord is on guard close by. On several occa-
sions in Victoria I have known the pair to fiercelj
attack children who went close to their abode, and
once the mother bird absolutely refused to leave her
eggs, even when threatened with violence.
CRAYFISH PICTURES.
[FOR THE BULLEITN.]
In a quiet place of oysters
When the midnight hour is near,
And disordered gladness roysters
Filled with plenitude of beer,
It is good to sit a-dreaming
While the magic crayfish draws
Clear-life visions, lush and gleaming,
With the scarlet of his claws.
For the crayfish is a painter,
And the canvas of the night
Glows with pictures subtler, fainter
Than the works of day’s delight,
Till the eyes of Kate and Nancy,
Looking o’er his ruined shell,
Through an atmosphere of fancy
Weave anew their broken spell.
Nancy, with the laughing dimple,
And the blue eyes windy clear,
Winsome as the morn, and simple
As the bud that drops a tear
When the wind is in the roses,
And the milkman in the street
Shouts to wake the house, and closes
Clanging gates in his retreat.
Nancy, with the soft arms clinging
As her laugh to memory clings ;
Nancy, with the pure voice singing
Like a nai’d of the springs;
Nancy, as the cray can draw her,
Sweet and light as air and sky,
Blushing as at first I saw her
Ere the cask of life went dry.
Kate, with dark eyes full of wonder
’Neath a tress of errant hair,
Like a storm-cloud bearing thunder
And the ready lightning flare;
Kate, with the twin flaming blisses
Of her full and scarlet lips,
Framed, as she for love, for kisses—
Stinging joys of passion’s whips.
Oh, the crayfish is a painter!
Kate upon his canvas glows
Full and splendid, nothing fainter
Than the heart of some red rose
By the rivers of Damascus,
Burning in its scented fire,
Set by Allah’s hand to task us
With the flame-toil of desire.
Crayfish, that in scarlet hummeth
Nasal music to the night,
Lo, the sleepy Dago cometh
Giving pause to my delight;
Over us the hour is chiming,
And the time is ripe to part
Even while thy song is rhyming
With the music of my heart.
From the quiet place of oysters
Lone I go into the dark,
Shutting, as in silent cloisters.
Visions care can never cark;
Dreams of Kate, and thoughts of Nancy |
Thou hast wakened for an hour,
Sleep with memory and fancy
Till a brother cray has power!

“Then I saw Chamberlain’s Tablets advertised, and

“Scaphoid” : “Sir Octopus” (B. 21/11/’l2)
has evidently made but a hasty examination of himself
and relatives, or he would not be so ready to take
the word of his friend, Victor Hugo, whose know-
ledge of zoological mysteries was subjugated to the
beauties of Romance. Could anyone seriously call an
octopus a lump of slime? Quite the other way.
Would he only submit himself to the moulding
process (vulcanising would be unnecessary), the
octopus would make an ideal motor tyre, as those
know who have tried to hack off a tentacle. Now,
then, the cephalopoda, which include the cuttle-
fishes, squids, octopi and nautili, are marine mol-
lusca of a high-grade organisation. There is a head,
bearing a pair of highly-developed eyes, which is
surrounded by the anterior portion of the foot (pro-
podium), modified into arms or tentacles. The
body is bilaterally symmetrical. The posterior part
of the foot is modified to form a funnel, leading out
from what is called the mantle cavity. A shell is
sometimes present, sometimes absent. When present
it is usually internal (remember the cuttle-fish), but
sometimes external, and in the nautili is capable
of retaining the body of the animal. These, then,
are, roughly, the distinctive features of the cephalo-
poda, which are further divided into sub-classes, and
in the sub-class dibranehiata (two gills) the octopus
family finds a resting-place as the order oetopoda.
In the same sub-class dibranehiata are also the de-
capods, which include the cuttle-fishes, squids, etc.
The alimentary tract of the octopus can be summed
up in a few lines. The mouth is placed on a defini-
tely-shaped head, and is provided with a pair of
horny jaws. The visceral mass is symmetrical, and
not coiled. The mantle encloses posteriorly and
ventrally a large mantle cavity, in which are situated
the plume-like gills, and the excretory, reproductive
and anal apertures. In this same mantle cavity
there is also an ink sac, opening by a definite duct
into the last-mentioned aperture. So “Sir Octopus,”
on the world-wide authority of Parker and Ilaswell’s
“Text-book of Zoology^’—a delightful book—is a
more highly respectable beastie than he thought, and
he must look a long way lower down the scale for the
weirdity with inlet and vent in one. You’ll find
him in the case of the liver-fluke, for one example.
Even the poor old cungevoi, which we see as an
adult on the rocks at low tide, though of lowly
origin, being meat inside and vegetable outside, is
built on the same principle as the octopus regarding
the excretory function. To show there is no ill-
feeling, I’ll take the risk of shaking one of “Sir
Octopus’s” flippers.
“Tiaki”: There are many Maori proverbs
which have not yet seen the light of print. Some
of Henare’s sayings are very subtle, and, in some
cases are synonymous with the shearer’s “back-
chat.” F’rinstance, “The man’s talk is from the
back of his head,” was a common saying of many
generations of brown brethren. Another of Henare’s:
“He isn’t a crayfish that he becomes red so soon.”
This applies to a person suspected of being guilty
of something, who blushes when the act is men-
tioned. Here is one which anti-militarists may pin
in their hats: “The spear which, being thrown, is
parried, means death to the thrower.” It’s equal to
“Get your blow in first.” In the old days Henare
usually lived in a fort on a hill. His mailin'/akai,
where the leumara (sweet potato) and other edible
root-crops were cultivated, was generally on a flat
some distance away; and the lazy warrior, secure
THE NEW FANTOD.
THE SUNDOWNER: “ This cursed drink!"
hi a peace of many moons, would build himself a
residence near the kitchen garden in order to avoid
the night and morning climb. The Te" Ngipona,
from the neighboring tribe, would drop in casually
on some dark night, and then all would be lamenta-
tion, long-pig and burnt villas. Hence Henare’s
saying: “Gables standing in the cultivation plot are
food for the flames.” Here is another applicable to
governments which borrow and squander: “If you
spit on the soil, will the spittle again moisten your
dry mouth?” It also applies to the land-selling,
motor-buying Henare; but he won’t understand it
that way.
MAKING THINGS RIGHT.
PROMINENT CITIZEN OF BUNGARER: “ Look ’ere, Jimmy, the boys ’as told us ter say they
ain't goin' ter paterinise yer blanky pub, because yer ain't satisfied with employin'
a Chow rouseabout, but yer’s porn an’ took on a blanky black cook."
JIMMY: "All li'—you tellem bloys me sackem blanky black cook—me do cookin’ meself.”
“Pennib”: Dave was brought into the
township to identify his mate, who had been muti-
lated in a railway accident. At the door of the pub
where the corpse was housed, he was met by Kelly,
the John in charge of the case. “I suppose there’s
somethin’ yer’ll be able to recognise ’im by, eh?”
“Oh, yes,” drawled David, “I’d know ’im anywhere
be a narsty corf ’e ’ad.”
* * # *
“Reigle”: Re “Chloe’s” par on the tragic
disappearance of the male spider (B. 7/11/’l2), the
drone bee also fails to survive his
matrimonial entanglement. The
queen leaves the hive on her
nuptial flight 10 days after her
birth, and is accompanied by all
the drones who have inside infor-
mation, or obtain knowledge of
the event by accident, bribery or
wireless. The lady, however, is
no polygamist, and one drone only
plays the r6le of husband, paying
for the distinction with his life.
The mating is done on the wing,
and the drone dies immediately,
his body, shrivelled to half its
original size, dropping to the
earth. The queen returns to the
hive with the rest of the drones,
and has no further use for the
male bee during her career. She
lives for about four years, and,
during each season, lays from
2000 to 4000 eggs per day. The
drones, on the other hand, are for-
tunate if they live through a
single, season. On the slightest
slackening of the honey flow
they, receive l notice to quit,
and, if they' don’t quit, they
are slaughtered, and the dead
bodies ejected from the hive. I
have seen them piled up 3in. high
towards the cloje of the season. A drone has not the
necessary headgear to collect nectar from the blossoms
for himself, nor has he a sting wherewith to defend
himself, so that he usually prefers a sudden death
to starvation outside. It amounts to Hobson’s choice,
and the ants get him either way.
“Speargrass”: Although it may be news
to many Abos. it is none the less a fact that the
ordinary hawk will tackle a snake. It was news to
me until one day when, resting after 14 rounds, with
a bush fire, I saw the billed beast arguing with
something beside the creek. On closer examination
the something proved to be 4ft. of annoyed serpent,
which, after side-stepping the point for a minute or
two, suddenly remembered an important appointment
and, grabbing his hat, proceeded up stairs into a
tree. The hawk leaped after him and undoubtedly
would have done him an injury if I hadn’t rushed
up with a sapling and chased the bird away. Fear-
ing, however, that it might return I carefully re-
moved the inducement with one swipe. After that
the proceedings were as dull as a Legislative Council.
“Expert”: I’ll grant the keen sense of
smell possessed by the fox, but I’m rapidly coming
to the opinion that his sense of hearing is even
keener. The other day I saw a dog fox, after mak-
ing a preliminary skirmish over a rabbit warren,
suddenly start to sink a shaft at the rate of a mile
a minute or so. Examined the place later, and
found a depth of 4ft. from the roof to the dining-
room.
“Ginger” : Are there aip- members of the
Israel Cult in Abostralta? If so, I can give them a
lead that may be worth a bit of prospecting. The
aboriginals of the south and south-west of W.A.
follow the ancient Hebraic custom of circumcision.
Which is the reason one port on the coast was
christened by the discoverer Israelite Bay. So far
as I know this is the only part of Australia where
the ancient rite is practised.
BUSH OCCUPATIONS—RUNNING
SCRUBBERS.
McNortli” : YV lien Bill Smith, trader, of
St. Agnin s (Papua), threw in the towel after a few
rounds with fever, the residents of the lonely island
decided to purchase a tombstone to commemorate
Bill s virtues. The tombstone arrived, engraved and
ready; but in landing it on the beach it was broken
in halves, and was, therefore, useless for the purpose
intended. The camp smoothed its disappointment as
much as possible with the aid of firewater, and,
during the process, the genius of the crowd got an
idea. The tombstone need not be wholly wasted,
after all. We could lay one half of the slab face up
and use it as a baking-board. We did it, and
thereafter every damper in St. Agnin’s was liable
to bear the whole or part of this inscription:—
SACRED
TO THE MEMORY
OF
WILLIAM SMITH.
Speargrass”: I agree with “Warrum-
bucca’s” contemptuous remarks (B. 14/11/’l2) on
the suggested co-operation of farmers in the owner-
ship of implements. The lurid, profanity of the
backbone, who had tossed up with a neighbor for the
first use of a reaper and binder and lost, would set
alight to the adjoining crops. The co-operation that
the cocky needs most is the sort that will get his
produce into the consumer’s hands without the fat of
it sticking to the fingers of various agents and other
get-a-bit middlemen. If that sort w’ere jn vogue the
consumer would get the stuff much cheaper, though
farmers would have a good deal more. At present
the fat middleman holds on to about half of the
cocky’s profit, and thd consumer is howling about
the increased cost of things in general. It is,
however, a wearisome job trying to ram into
cookies the means by which they can work out their
own salvation—almost as wearisome as trying to get
adequate Protection, a railway through the Territory,
and about half a bushel of other screaming necessi-
ties. If they would only pull their socks up and get
going, they would soon have the fat parasites weep-
ing—and getting work.
* * * *
‘‘Douglas T.”: The invocation, “Send it
down, Hughie” (B. 14/11 /’l2), originated, I believe,
in the strenuous efforts of the late Hugh McColl in
the cause of irrigation in Victoria. McColl was an
old-time M.L.A. in that State, and fought with Cale-
donian persistency for great water-conservation
schemes. The Bulletin, many years ago, contained
frequent allusions to “Hughie” and his “canawls,”
and as these “canawls” or channels ultimately took
the place of Providence in drought seasons, “Hughie”
gradually drifted into the position of a sort of
deity in the business. (Thor and Wodin and a good
many more of the gods of auld lang syne got into
the catalogue on evidence of an equally shadowy
nature.)* Only a few days ago, after a very heavy fall
of moisture in this district (Wakool), I heard a
boundary-rider remark: “My oath, good old Hughie
has been on the job.” Senator McColl is a son of
the “rainmaker.”
* * * *
“Billy T.” : This is a story of heroic de-
votion and reckless daring on the part of the hired
man. His name was Davy Davis, and he was a
drifting, slipshod object, with a hacking cough
when he put in at Palmer’s, Quandong, and neg-
lected to go away. Then Wills, being
removed to Dimburra with two bushels
of one-homed tarantulas in his whis-
kers, Davy Davis automatically suc-
ceeded to the office, and was minister-
ing angel at Quandong, his duties
being to fetch and carry, to scrub
and polish, and dig, and hew, and
mend. He was a poor rouseabout,
but the pay was worse, and Palmer
kept him on for the lack of a better
man who wouldn’t want more, or a
worse one who would take less. Davy
had been in office perhaps two months
when the great fire occurred at Quan-
dong. The big, rambling, Wooden
building was old, the weather had
been dry and hot for three weeks, and
flames went through it as if it had
been liberally oiled. In the scramble
and excitement of the first 15 minutes
after Palmer got out, with the rear
of his pyjamas ignited, nobody knew
exactly what was happening, or the
extent of the mischief. There was no
certainty that two or three people
were not going up in smoke with the
squatter’s old home. Then Davy Davis
came charging up from the hut,
dressed in somebody else’s boots and
another man’s hat. For seven seconds
he stared at the conflagration; then,
ducking his nut, he dived in. It was
just like a hero taking a header into
a troubled sea of flame. Davy was
absent two minutes, during which the
stricken crowd gazed with horrible
expectancy. “Who’s he after?” wailed
Palmer. Nobody seemed to know.
“Who’s missing?” asked the distracted
pastoralist. It was impossible to say
who was within besides Davy Davis;
and as the moments passed, it seemed
that the rouseabout’s absence must
be permanent. Then Davis rushed
from the door he entered, with his
whiskers burnt off and his hair aflame,
and with just enough sense and strength left
to seat himself under the tank tap. Davy recovered
in a few minutes. Then he stood up,' a singed,
blackened and blistered hero, and shook a grilled fist
at the crowd. “Who shifted that whisky?” he
roared.
Another example of how the
child in the Cow country (N.S.W. North Coast)- gets
saturated with the beast. The sth class was having
a lesson on abbreviations in common use. The
letters “P.C.” were reached. “Now, boys, what
does P.C. stand for ?” Quick as lightning came the
answer, “Poddy Calf.” And can you wonder when
you know that the youngster probably spends 16
hours out of the 24 in Cow atmosphere? One at
least of that class is dragged into that atmosphere by
an alarm clock at 3.30 a.jn. Certainly he’s a man
nearly—he’s twelve.

PERSONAL
ITEMS
Monsignor Phelan, of Melbourne, attains
the dignity of Bishop of Gippsland. He has
been marked out for it ever since Bishop
Corbett died —that is to say, failing his ap-
pointment as Coadjutor-Archbishop. The
uew Bishop is a Kilkenny native, who came
to Melbourne as a young priest in 1888, and
has had the luck never to be sent out of
Melbourne’s sight and mind. After 12 years
he became Dean of St. Patrick’s and right-
hand man to Archbishop Carr, just as Arch-
deacon Hindley is to Archbishop Clarke. In
1908 he was made Vicar-General, and ad-
ministered the Archdiocese for 13 months,
which gave him some claim to become Coad-
jutor-Archbishop. The choice lay eventually
between him and Dr. Mannix, President of
Maynooth; and the latter got the prize.
Very shortly Archbishop Carr may settle in
Rome as general Australian adviser, a post
which, it is said, Cardinal Moran desired.
THE PARTY MACHINES.
The people of Australia had begun to realise that
they had to deal not with what was on the political
platforms, but what was behind those platforms.
—Recent HA NSARD report.
Ballarat, which knows how to sound the
tabor, is preening itself over the perform-
ance of one of its youngsters, Gordon Gum-
mow, who has just passed the final barris-
ters’ exam, at the mature age of 19.
The S. Aus. Public Service got the shock
of the year a week or so ago when it heard
of the plain, unfrilled dismissal of W. H.
Cherry, one of its senior inspectors of
schools. Starting as a pupil teacher, Cherry
jumped to the front, rapidly became first
assistant under Neale (ex-Direetor of Edu-
cation f in Tasmania) at the Sturt-street
‘ model” school, and presently was one of
the two inspectors who ran the S. Aus.
Department while the Director was away.
Then the_ over-ripe fruit thought it felt itself
melting in the mouth of a girl-teacher in a
country school, and a charge of “improper
behavior” did the rest.
The Earl of Liverpool, who goes as Gov-
ernor of Maoriland, received a Maori wel-
come on the arrival of the Malwa at Circu-
lar Quay, Sydney, last week. The new
Excellency is a son of Cecil George Savile
Foljambe, who served in the Maori war
(1863-4), was at the storming of Rangiriri,
and was a member of the Commons from 1880
to 1892, when Gladstone raised him to the
peerage under his grandfather’s expired title,
Earl of Liverpool. His ancestor was a
patron of Governor Phillip, who named the
Hawkesbury after his then title. And, still
later, Macquarie named the little town on
George’s River, Liverpool, after Ilawkes-
bury’s son, Lord Liverpool.
“Kong” takes another view :• —-
lie the screed of “G.” (B. 28/11/’l2), concerning
F. Tate, Director of Victorian Education. That
functionary has not made the Uni. free to all
teachers. It is free to 20, whom the Department
(the particular officer is not known - ) selects from
applicants. A “free
track’’ has been
“opened from
school to Uni.,”
certainly ; but it is
a sinuous, ill-
. cleared, desolate,
deserted byway,
covered by ruts and
pits. It has sev-
eral branches,
mostly leading
from metropolitan
schools. The brand
of the academician
is too visible on
most of Tate’s
. acts. Four years
ago I heard him
express the hope
that, within his
time, the Depart-
ment would be
staffed by gradu-
ates of a Univer-
sity. May the Lord
have mercy on
primary education,
shop Id his desire
be fulfilled. The
root of the matter
is this. Tate is
neither the tin god
“G.” thinks he is,
nor is he the com-
plete rotter depict-
ed by the “decent
duffers” of whom
he often' talks,. As
a man, he is to (ally

tion, particularly

a figurehead or rubber-stamp. The trouble is, that
he attempts to make rubber-stamps of ao many below
him.
Artist Strutt, identified with Australia
and Maoriland over 50 years ago, is still
living; his home is in Wadhurst, Sussex
(Eng.). He has acquired some distinction,
especially in theological subjects, since he
left in 1862 ; but while his Australian work
is technically inferior to what he has done
since, it is infinitely more interesting in this
quarter. His best-Known
painting is “Black Thursday,”
a rather cramped picture of the
peerless Victorian scorcher in
1851. He was in Melbourne
then. More valuable than
“Black Thursday” is his draw-
ing of the Melbourne St. Patrick’s
Hall Parliament, with portraits
of Fawkner, O’Shanassy and
all the notables. Yet the most
remarkable thing he ever did is
a painting, founded on fact, of
bushrangers sticking up over a
dozen peonle on St. Kilda-road,
near Melbourne. The thing
actually hanoened in 1852.
This and “Black Thursday”
ought to be in the Melbourne
Gallery. At present they are
held by individuals in England,
and maybe £250 would buy both.
Dead, at 47, O. P. Law, editor of the
Hobart Daily Post from its birth 44 years
ago. Up till eight davs before lie went
under from meningitis the kindly and cap-
able pressman was in his usual health : but
that health was never very robust, and the
strenuous time incidental to the teething
period of a not too-well nourished daily,
took a great deal out of the willing worker.
Though a native o f Ware (Eng.), Mr. Law
spent most of his life in Australia, and was
a loyal lover of the new country.
THE MODERN MINOTAUR.
A representative of the American Beef Trust stated
in England that, since the Trust commanded 50
millions, sterling, there was nothing to prevent its
success in Australia if it desired to 'buy up the meat
interests of the Commonwealth. — Cable.
Some personal recollections of the founder
of Melbourne :
The J. P. Fawkner reminiscences, contributed by
“W. ’ (B. 21 /11 /’ 12), coincide with my own recollec-
lections of the garrulous, egotistical old man. He
was a good hater, but withal genial and tolerant of
the views of others, though extremely jealous of his
claim to the title of Forrader of Melbourne. Not of
Victoria, by the way; he freely admitted the prior
claims of the Hentys as pioneers of the western por-
tion of the . State, and by his own order the inscrip-
tion on his. coffin read: “John Pascoe Fawkner,
bounder of Melbourne.” Though a member of the
\ ictorian House of Fat Landlords, he held views that
were considered Radical. Witness his strenuous ad-
vocacy of the cause of the Ballarat miners in 1855,
and also his aid to the cause of unlocking the lands
in the following decade.
The flogging .incident rankled in his mind through-
out his life. Though but a youth when it occurred —
I think .abtfut 17 or 18—lie felt it so much that years
later me voyaged to Sydney to obtain some measure
ot redress, but failed. When it was suggested in his
later years that he should visit London and pay his
respects .to Queen Victoria, he remarked bitterly that
he could never bow the knee to ,the representative of
a Government that could inflict upon him such a
Cruel indignity,
Dying ..without issue, he personally did nothing to
populate the empty spaces of Australia. His sister
Elizabeth, two or three years younger, did much
better in that respect. Marrying first one Green, at
the remarkably early age of 14, she was left a widow
a few years later with one son, who died in early
manhood. Her second venture (her husband this time
being a scion of one of the old Norfolk Island no-
bility, who were deported to V.D.L. in 1808 to make
way for the convict hell which afterwards made that
delectable isle so notorious) resulted in six sons and
two daughters, all of whom, with but one exception,
married and had families ranging from seven to 13 in
number. These again multiplied, and are now in the
third and iourth generation, scattered pretty well
throughout the Commonwealth and neighboring
Dominion. .# Elizabeth died in 1851, near Hobart.
About 1860,, and two following years, “Johnnie”
paid several visits to his southern relatives, after an ab-
years or so. They were mostly members
ot tne cocky persuasion. Writer, a grand-nenhew
then a nipper remembers being the grateful recipient
ot sundry shillings on these occasions. On the last of
the visits our big relative was stricken with a serious
illness, which detained him for some weeks. His aged
brother-in-law, in driving home after seeing him off
to Melbourne, met with a fatal accident: and I re-
J° hnnie ” hoping that his relatives
would not connect him with the unfortunate occur-
rence. whether it was owing to that event or to the
giowmg infirmities of age, he did not visit Tas. again
during the remaining eight years of his life.
The old man displayed considerable generosity on
/these occasional visits, liquidating doctors’ bills etc
for. the more impecunious of his relatives. But he
must have, had a mean streak in his composition
spipewhere. On ope of his visits he made a lavish
distribution of cotton print dresses and iewellerv
amongst the younger female relatives. When the
iewellerv was discovered to be “Brum.” I remember
his popularity suffered a serious decline. Though not
possessing the abounding wealth he was popularly

“5.0.”: Sam Gopley, pictured
by Low in The Bueletin
(5/12/T2) as Westralia’s cattle-
king, has had a quick rise. Only
about a score of years ago he was
running a barber’s shop in Fre-
mantle. With the proceeds of the
lather pot and “a skinner on the
Perth Cup” be bought sand. South
Perth was the name of the sand,
which went begging in those days.
Cottages were dotted here and
there; then Samuel got the ferries
ready, and the land sale followed. It
was a gold mine. By this time
Copley had become firmly estab-
lished as the bank clerk’s and civil
servant’s monthly friend. Next,
he took to drink, as Tykes will,
and wasn’t content till he had
mopped up a brewery. A craving
for his native pudding carried him
back to Yorkshire in company with
Fred D. Good. They had a letter
of introduction from an English-
man in the West to his people, and
took advantage of it to select a
wife each from the household.
Apparently it was an accident
that Sam did not see the light of
day in Jerusalem, as he has ever
taken kindly to the finance in-
dustry. He has never struck a
duffer yet, and it is said he
averred that he would be a
millionaire before 1910. Lately he sold
the barge concern across the. river to the
Government for “a fair thing,” and is
spending his declining days ruminating upon
the possibilities of ticks or Japs up north,
and the vagaries of City Antonios down south.
From a friend of the family:—
Mrs. “Charley” Kingston has got into the courts
at last, and made big scare-headings for the papers.
It is all part of a tragedy. Charley Kingston, who
wasn’t a Wowser, had the bad luck to live in a
Wowserish community, and when he married there
was much shaking of heads. The lady was “beneath
him,” and the Wowserish three-quarters of S. Aus.
settled down to the idea that she was an uneducated,
“impossible” creature. As a matter of fact,
Charley saw to it that she didn’t remain unedu-
cated ; and her correspondence is worthy of that
master of terse composition himself. But she was
ostracised. She saw her husband also cold-shouldered
in a social way. He didn’t care tuppence, but she
probablv did, for she was full of pride of her great
man. Becoming a rebel, she treated herself badly—
and became more rebellious, as S. Australia’s shoulder
grew colder and colder. But she clung to Kingston:
all through his long illness she cared for him, and
oersonallv did the greater part of the little law
business that was left to him. When he died she
retired to the quiet outskirts of Brighton, where the
Kingston home used to he. and lived in the lonely old
place where Sneaker “Pat” Kingston, Charley’s
father, used to reign. There her eccentricities grew. No-
body having wanted her she now wanted nobody, and
emphasised it by mostly carrying a revolver, a razor and
a bludgeon. Finally, a friendly doctor tried to dis-
suade her from the revolver habit, and when he
failed (tasting the bludgeon in the process) he thought
it best to put the law at work. So Kingston’s old
friend Varley had the sorrowful iob of fining the vic-
tim of strong emotions, and binding her over to keep
the peace. It is a pathetic business which need
never have been had S. Australia owned a little
more real charity.

Died the other day, at sea, between Col-
ombo and Fremantle, William Kiddle,
brother of the better-known Lewis, who
died earlier in the year. There were five
big Kiddle brothers, most of them sheepy,
and most of them interested in the Riverina.
William of late years had, however, gone
on to Wallbundrie, near Albury, which he
bought originally in partnership with Balme,
the big London wool-broker.
H. H. L. A. Brose, the new S. Aus.
Rhodes Scholar, is 22, the son of a local
hairdresser, a Jb.Sc. of Adelaide bniversity,
teacher of French at Prince Alfred College
(his own old school), one of the best
pianists in Adelaide, and a brilliant runner

captain of tne University end Y.iu.O.A.

TERRIBLE BILL.
[FOR THE BULLEITN.]
His persistent inaction during his tenure of office,
now extending to nearly three years, only tends to
strengthen the belief that the party does not desire
to suppress or limit the operations of the trusts and
combines. It wishes to preserve them as the theme
for excited rhetoric. — Argus, on Attorney-General
Hughes.
The only possible course for the electors who do
not wish to give an unrestricted charter to those
who would unify and socialise the government of
Australia is to vote No to each and all of the party’s
proposals for the suppression or limitation of trusts
and combines. — Same Argus, same leader.
'E’s a terrible bloke is this Hughes, Bill Hughes;
You can tell by the glint of ’is eye.
O lor, ’e’s a savage! ’E’ll plunder an’ ravage
An’ knock lor-an’-order sky-high.
Ho, ’e kicks up a dust when ’e goes for the Trust,
While the people ejaculate “My!”
But there isn’t no ’arm in ole Hughes, Bill Hughes—
If yer listen I’ll tell yer for why.
Though you’d think be the look of this Hughes, Bill
Hughes,
That ’e’d cat. the monopolist band,
It’s only ’is gammon; he’s really a-shammin’ ;
’E’d let ’em eat out of ’is ’and ;
’E’d let ’em lie down be ’is side, though ’is frown
When ’e torks is an ’orrible sight;
But if they was slaughtered be Hughes, Bill Hughes,
Why, ’e ivouldn’t have nothink to fight!
But still he’s a terror is Hughes, Bill Hughes,
An’ ’e looks sich a vierlent bloke;
is Socialist notions is raisin’ commotions
’Mid all of us right-thinkin’ folk.
When ’e starts fer to rouse on our friends in the
’Ouse,
Oh, you take it from me, ’e’s a sight,
An’ the things that ’e says to ’em—Hughes, Bill
Hughes—
Well, I tell yer, ’e isn’t perlite.
But you needn’t be frightened of Hughes, Bill
Hughes,
Fer ’e doesn’t mean ’arf wot ’e says.
All ’is glarin’ an’ starin’ an’ blazin’ an’ blarin’,
They’re only ’is quaint little ways.
Why, ’e'd not ’urt a mouse, an’ is tork in the ’Ouse
It is jest wot ’e does' cos ’e must.
Them Combines ain’t frightened of Hughes, Bill
Hughes,
An’ ’e’d never do ’arm to a Trust.
But still ’e’s a puzzle is Hughes, Bill Hughes,
To a Tory like me or like you.
With ’is plottin’ an’ schemin’ an’ darin’ an’ dreamin’,
You never know wot ’e might do.
So it’s plain that you must, if you cherish the Trust,
Vote a “No” to all six of ’is schemes.
For I ain’t very certain of Hughes, Bill Hughes;
An’ he mightn’t be quite wot ’e seems.

1912.. 1,284,364 520,249 174,664 2016 587,435
The year’s figures show an improvement all round.
The weak feature has hitherto been the expense rate ;
and as the next little lot of figures show, there has
been a steady and very marked change for the better
in that connection too: —
Expenses Compared with Total Income.
1903 .. £l7 14 1 p.e. 1908 .. £l6 14 6 p.c.
1904 .. 18 1 5 „ 1909 ~ 15 1 1 „
1905 .. 18 2 9 „ 1910 .. 15 0 3 „
1906 .. 17 13 9 „ 1911 .. 14 14 4 „
1907 .. 17 10 8 „ I 1912 .. 13 11 11 „
Nor does that exhibit the whole improvement, because
the shrinkage in the percentage of outgoings has been
accompanied by a rapid growth of business, due to
an energetic canvass for new risks. Following The
Bulletin’s practice of charging 7 p.c. on renewals
and 3 p.c. on single premium and annuity busi-
ness, it will be found that the new busi-
ness cost 104.2 p.c. of the first-year premiums
collected during the 12 months. There are offices
which make a better showing than that, notably
those which got in early and established Industrial
branches to serve as kindergartens and feeders for
the Ordinary business; but, though the National
Mutual’s costs are still comparatively high, they are
moving the right way, and moving fast. In 1911
the new-business cost 110.6 p.c. on the same basis of
calculation.
Certainly, in comparing the two years, one small
point has to be noted; in 1911 the society had its
triennial investigation, which cost £1770, while in
the past year only a few pounds went that way. A
more doubtful economy is in the matter of medical
fees. These were £7265, as against £7844 in 1911
and £6628 in 1902, though in the last-named year
the new premiums collected were only about one-
fourth as great. Or take this comparison:—

Premiums. Fees. Income.
A.M.P £208,529 £26,884 12.9 p.c.
National Mutual . . 120,389 7,265 6.0 ~
The exact value of medical examination is in dis-
pute. It can hardly be denied, however, that it has
some value. The National Mutual evidently believes
that it can be dispensed with profitably in a good
many cases, and that, if the society has to pay a trifle
more through earlier death claims, that trifle doesn’t
amount to as much as is saved by dispensing with
many of the examinations. It is merely a difference
in office policy, but it has to be taken into account
in comparing the expenses of various societies or
companies. Those people who think there is too
much red-tape about insurance office methods, and
that money is wasted in preliminaries, will, of course,
favor the National Mutual’s plan. Those who think that
it is best for an office to eliminate as many bad risks
as possible by insisting on practically universal medi-
cal examination (among other things), will, of course,
not favor the National Mutual.
In other respects the National Mutual is prepared
to back its judgment—which mostly means taking a
chance. The next comparison illustrates that; it
shows the disposition of the assets: —
1900. 1910. 1911. 1912.
Public securities.. 3-4p.c. 5-1 p.c. 5'3 p.c. 6‘2 p.c.
Mortgages .. 50‘5 „ 55T „ 58'4 ~ 60'6 ~
Foreclosures .. 4-4 ~ 1-3 „ 1-0 ~ 0-9
Freeholds .. 12'7 „ 12'8 ~ 11 '8 ~ 10-8 ”
Loans on policies. 14'3 ~ 9'B ~ 9-9 ~ 9-6
Other assets .. 14-7 ~ 15-9 ~ 13‘6 ~ 11'9 ”
Thus, while some offices have from 40 to 60 p.c. of
their assets in public securities, which may be re-
garded as the safest of all investments, the National
Mutual has only 6 p.c. It prefers mortgages, and
while others are rapidly increasing their holding of
Government stocks, it lends out more and more on
the security of real estate. Whether this is wise is
also a matter of opinion. This much is indispu-
table: property values in Australia are liable to
violent fluctuations, and many mortgage cos. have
lost very heavilv through over-valuinv and over-
lending in periods of boom. Admittedly, this class
of security gives a higher gross return than the gilt-
edged Government stock.. The following shows this
society’s figures, after deducting rates and taxes:—
Interest Earned on Average Funds.
1903 .. £4 13 11 p.c. 1908 .. £4 11 8 p.c.
1904 .. 4 13 9 „ 1909 .. 4 12 11 „
1905 .. 1 13 7 „ 1910 .. 4 13 3 „
1906 .. 4 12 8 „ 1911 .. 4 13 0 „
1907 .. 411 6 „ 1912 . . 413 4 „
No regular amount is taken from these earnings and
put to the credit of the Investment Fluctuation Fund.
That reserve now amounts to £68,896, which isn’t
much considering that the loans on mortgage total
£4,527,642, while foreclosures represent £64,482
and freeholds £813,643. Higher interest is required
on mortgages than on Government stock, because
(for one thing) there is more risk of depreciation ;
and it, therefore, seems only a fair and proner thing
that a portion of that higher interest should be paid
regularly into a contingency fund, seeing that ab-
solute safety is the first essential in an office doing
life-insurance business.

The tide of profits has run out a bit further from
the 1910 high-water mark under the influence of
the drought which happened in the early part of
this year. And next year also the same drought
will bite a bit out of the profits, because the lamb
that wasn’t born last autumn won’t yield any wool
worth mentioning’ next spring, and the wheat crop
that wasn’t planted, because the land was too dry,
won’t take up much room in the grain stores. How-
ever, things, so far as the past year goes, might
easily have been a great deal worse. Prices
have been excellent: wool brought Id. to 2d.
more than in the previous year, and things were
reckoned good even then. And it is, of course,
easier for such a co. as this to earn its commission
when wool and other prices are high than when
they are low, and a great deal of the stuff is held
over to be either offered again locally or shipped
for foreign sales.
When this co. bought the old firm out it gave
£40,000 for goodwill. The capital paid up was
and still is £lOO,OOO. Circular Quay then had the
undisputed command of the wool trade, so H., J. and
D. had to follow the pioneers, and build huge
stores alongside. This property account ate up
nearly £180,000; and that meant a big mortgage.
This mortgage for years kept the co.’s nose to the
grindstone; still it probably did some good—if it
hadn’t been for that brake the co. most likely
would have plunged further into a lot worse securi-
ties in the early ’9o’s. These figures show the
thing pretty clearly:—
1895. 1900. 1911. 1912.
Debt on mortgage ..£97,000 <78 ( 000 £45,000 £45,000
Other debts .. .. 77,383 115,605 60,93 S 102,978
Freeholds (cost) .. 179,514 179,514 190,626 190,626
Total written off free-
holds 9,514 26,014 47,514 47,514
Advances, etc.. .. 121,770 173,082 136,481 186,541
Or we can put it this way:—
1895. 1912.
Advances and other assets apart
from premises .. .. £121,770 £186,541
Liabilities 174,383 147,978
Deficit .. £52,613 Surplus £38,563
Thus in 17 years the co., besides paying its divi-
dend, has improved its position to the extent of
£91,176, and in addition has spent £11,112 on
premises. Of this profit .£38,000 has been used to
write down freeholds. But that doesn’t mean that
the money has been thrown into the sink. It
probably means that too much was paid for or
spent on the property in the first place; but that
doesn’t alter the fact that the surplus profit shown
above has been actually made, and used mainly to
reduce the co.’s mortgage or increase its assets, and
thus improve its future net earnings. Those assets
apart from premises consist mainly of advances, and
there has been a big jump in them during the year.
That’s the trouble with this sort of business. The
profits are so fine when things go well that when
they don’t go well the co., or firm, is inclined to
make advances to its temporarily hard-up clients,
in order to keep the business. Then it develops into
a game of back up or forfeit —or occasionally back
up and forfeit, which is a very painful game indeed.

This is the amazing Melbourne building society
which didn’t have to write off any of its capital
after the burst of the bubble in the early ’9o’s;
hence the div. is paid on the original capital. Cer-
tainly there were losses, but they were made good
out of either accumulated reserves or current profits
—the latter, of course, being impinged upon at the
expense of dividends. The next table shows what the
foreclosures amounted to so recently as 10 years
ago:—

1912 .. 33,234 119,905 4,158 Nil
Practically the co. has thus now a clean sheet. Ex-
cept for less than £5OOO the assets consist exclu-
sively of new advances or other business on building-
society terms. From the fact that nothing has been
written off during the past year, it may be assumed
that -in the opinion of the management all these
assets are worth 20s. in the £. Nor is there anv
likelihood of any such sudden and serious slump in
values as would throw a society like this on its
beam-ends. The Vic. wheat harvest is turning out
from fair to good, and, though there was a bad
autumn lambing, exceptional prices are being got for
wool —the best for years past. The stoppage or
shrinkage of the borrowing boom will inevitably
affect property values, because a good deal of Aus-
tralia’s abnormal prosperity in the last few years
has been artificial, the result, * not of raising crops,
but of raising loans; but, so long as borrowers are
not thrown out of work in wholesale quantities, the
well-managed building society can generally get its
advances reduced faster than the value shrinks. The
trouble in the ’9o’s was that it wasn’t a shrinkage ;
it was a sudden collapse. On the other hand, though
building-society investment ought to be reasonably
safe, there is not much prospect nowadays .of a very
sweet return, because the State rather lays itself out
to help people supply themselves with homes; and
the State isn t out after a profit, so it is a cold com-
petitor to bump against. Victoria certainly hasn’t
done as much as some others in this respect; but the
movement is all the one way—for the State to give
more and more help to thrifty people to get homes of
their own.

paid to 335. Theoretically the foregoing means that,
besides this capital of £585,000, the co. has other
assets valued at £145,763, after paying the current.
dividend. But obviously everything depends on the
valuation; and in assets of this kind, consisting
largely of standing timber, there is room for a very
wide difference of opinion. This is illustrated by the
fact that a little below the equator of the table
printed on top of these remarks there occurs the line ■
Assets written up, £227,458.” Land, with standing
timber, had in 1907 been reckoned worth £382,510-
m 1908 it was re-valued at £547,112. Practically’
of course, this meant that profits had previously been
under-estimated. And that is a point, too, which has
to be kept in mind in connection with this co.:
Su P ro^s can be little better than guessed at.
When the co. chops down a tree that tree is gone
for good; and though the co. knows how much it
gets for the timber, it must be pretty hard work to
say how much the assets have been reduced by the
removal of the vegetable, partly because the land
may be made more valuable, and partly because
other vegetables may have been increased' in value.
Apart altogether from the construction boom of the
last few years, and the consequent high price of
timbers, the tendency in the M.L. kauri market must,
it seems, be upward, because of the fast-diminishing
supplies. Many calculations have been made as
to the further period the forests will last, and the
calculators—official, mostly—-put it- down variously at
from 15 to 35 years. As supplies get shorter prices
will almost for certain get higher, and then there
will be a more or less sudden stop. But that won’t
be this year or next; and the cleared land will still
be a valuable consideration.
On present appearances the co. will own a good
deal more than the land when the end conies. Con-
sider this movement:—

Deficit ..£179,268
Surplus .. £85,741 £164,385 £218,164
The liquid assets consist of cash deposits, etc.
( £104,807),-book debts (£78,136), shares in other
cos. ( £72,862), and a trifle or two. Thus, besides
paying its dividend and buying plant and probably
odd pieces of timber land, the co. has in the past
11 years put itself £397,432 to the good. . In the
past three years alone there has been an increase of
£140,885 in the liquid assets. Whether the book
debts and shares in other cos. are more conservatively
or more generously valued now than they were, this
paper doesn’t know, though it observes that consider-
able sums have been written off; and the general
impression left is that the assets are worth all of 20s.
in the £. But though the figures just given are very
enticing, it must be remembered all the time that
the co. is eating its own head off —or most of its
head, anyway—and that in course of time there
won’t be any more to eat. Nevertheless it seems
to be making better provision to replace its wasting
assets than any other co. in a similar position in
the Commonwealth and Maoriland. And there are
plenty such cos., though unfortunately the public
doesn’t always recognise them till too late.

This’ little co.’s reserves now exceed the capital, and
it celebrates with a 10 p.c. dividend. Seeing that
its investments bring in over 8 p.c., the advance is
probably justified. The risks are, however, a bit
bigger than some trustee offices take, three-fifths
of the funds (capital and reserves) being in mort-
gages. A very profitable business has been done
for many years past; and nothing but the establish-
ment of a State monopoly in the trust business
(which is highly improbable) or very bad manage-
ment, is likely to seriously interfere with it. For
the trustee co. has come to stay and to grow, though
it is quite likely that sooner or later it will have
to do more for its money, although many others
(auctioneers, for instance) do less.

Of the past year’s profit £12,703 appears as an ad-
dition to a special fund, composed of profit “on
portion of properties sold and reserved pending com-
plete realisation.” As the remnants of these proper-
ties are got rid of the profits now reserved (if they
still exist) will be transferred to the profit and loss
account. Assuming that the remnants have been
fairly valued, the profit now put to reserve is as
much real profit as any of the rest of the £27,886.
Still, it is a good and wise thing to pour at least
portion of such profit into a special pot. A man has
a block of land fronting two streets. For the lot he
has paid £BOOO. He sells half of it, the end front-
ing one street, for £5OOO. Now, if the two streets
were equally fashionable and the two ends of the land
equally valuable, that man could fairly say he had
made £lOOO on the land sold. But supposing he
had an idea that the land he had hung on to was a
heap better than the other, and was worth £6OOO,
then he might reckon he had made a profit of £3OOO
on the sale of the other block. So the profit which
you suppose you have made out of the sale of a por-
tion of a property depends upon the value you put
on the portion that remains unsold ; and as you may
be quite wrong in your estimate, the safe thing is
to reserve part, at least, of the profit to cover con-
tingencies.
Like every other building society in Melbourne, this
one got into trouble when the wild borrowing of the
early ’9os stopped with a jerk, and the dreadful
boom burst. Very few, however, escaped as well
as this Fourth Victoria. It merely sustained shock
and bruises. And it pulled itself together rapidly.
Having done this, it saw that there was a good open-
ing for an undertaker at the scene of the wreck.
In past years it took over the remains of the Lygon
Permanent, South Melbourne, City of Prahran,
Premier and Planet building societies; in 1911 it
took over the Universal; in the past year the Eco-
nomic and the Melbourne Permanent were committed
to its charge. This means that it takes over the
assets and pays, or undertakes to pay, the share-
holders so much in addition to liquidating all lia-
bilities. The assets are usually a sediment, and not
very saleable ; but a big concern has a much better
chance of getting rid of them than a small one.
Also, of course, there is a saving in administration.

This little State bank was almost suffocated at its
birth. It looks as though it wasn’t at first in-
tended that it should do much good, or interfere to
any extent worth mentioning with the private banks.
At the end of 1910-11, after nine years’ operations,
it had a wretched little £206,998 lent out. And it
is doubtful whether even the customers it had were
getting much, if any, benefit from dealing with a
State institution. Anyway, accounts were being con-
stantly transferred to private hands. The trouble
was the same old centralisation and the same old
circumlocution and the same old red tape. A farm
in the Downs district was to be put up for sale, and
a young fellow who wanted to “chuck” banking and
go on the land fancied it. The State bank had in-
spected and valued the property just previously. The
young fellow applied to the State bank for a trifle of
money to go with his own. But there must be an-
other inspection; and as it hadn’t been made or
couldn’t be made in time, the customer turned into
a private bank and was welcomed. It hadn’t just
made a valuation ; yet it got the business through
in time. To improve things an amending Act was
passed last year, and a managing director takes the
place of the old Board of trustees. Also, to try to
make up for not having branches in the country,
local inspectors are being appointed, and agencies
will follow. This is all right. But what with Com-
monwealth Savings Banks and State Savings Banks
and semi-State Savings Banks and Agricultural Banks,
we are going to have just the same old waste that
we have had hitherto, and probably just the same
old indifferent service and the same old poor pay
for the too-numerous servants.
Meantime the new Act is evidently doing some
good. This shows that advances have jumped along:

As the turnover goes up, the rate of expenses comes
down ; and there is plenty of room yet for shrinkage.
When the expenses amount to about ss. p.c. of the
advances, things will be fairly satisfactory. But for
the fact that the State Treasury lends the bank the
money at 3 p.c., it would have been impossible for
the bank to have offered reasonable rates to settlers.
For the State to lend money at 3 p.c. means that it
subsidises the institution; and that shouldn’t be so.
Anyhow, if a subsidy is given, it should be called a
subsidy. Helped by this low rate of interest the
bank has made very fair progress in the matter of
reserves. But it needs them, for Queensland is a
place of booms and slumps—a place where flocks
multiply with amazing rapidity, and then die from
drought. Even in these good times 13 small pro-
perties are in possession, though three were got rid
of last year at a small loss. As a matter of fact,
up to now it hasn’t usually been the best security
or the best customer that has gone to this bank.
Hence, no doubt, the rather numerous foreclosures,
and the loss on realisation in even a pretty good
season.

From an old insurance man: “It must be
over three years since the Commission (Justice Hood
and G. 11. Knibbs) presented its report to Parlia-
ment on the subject of life assurance. That Com-
mission having done its duty (and done it very
ably), there the matter rests. No legislation has
arrived, though a former Attorney-General was sup-
nosed to have had an Insurance Bill in hand. One of the
features of the report that called forth glad acclaim,
and met, it was understood, with the almost unquali-
fied approval of the actuarial profession, was the
substitution of the actual reserve value of a life
policy for the entirely arbitrary and always unjust
surrender value that an office may formulate for the
victimisation of such of its policyholders as are
overtaken by misfortune, and for the increase of its
own surplus profits. During the last three years
thousands of policies must have lapsed owing to the
unfortunate circumstances of policyholders, i.e., the
surrender values have been exceeded by moneys bor-
rowed, interest thereon, and unpaid premiums; or by
accumulations of unpaid premiums and interest
thereon. Had the suggested legislation been enacted,
the larger surrender values (the full reserve values)
would have been available; and, possibly, very few
.of the thousands of lapsed policies would have had
their increased margins exhausted. Deaths, possibly
by the thousand, have ensued in the last three years,
and claimants under the life policies concerned have
been informed that the ‘surrender value was ex-
hausted and the policy lapsed before death.’ Then,
again, for want of the increased margin, borrowings
on policies—of vital moment, perhaps, to individuals
—have been limited to 90 p.c. of surrender value,
instead of 90 p.c. of reserve value, as should have
been the case, following the report of the Commis-
swn. We are sitting quiet while foreclosures upon
policies are actually taking place every day, when,
as a matter of fact, instead of suffering foreclosure,
borrowers should be entitled to larger advances. Who
is responsible for this cruel neglect of a splendid
duty—-the duty of helping an unfortunate man to
protect the most unselfish investment of his life and
the duty of safeguarding the interests of dependent
women and children?
I .,“ An< ?! :h . er as Pect of the case. Very many men effected
Hie policies when they were young, and their policy
moneys would have meant much in providing for

“It is quite possible that the Federal Parliament,
when it makes up its mind to deal with this matter,
will bungle it and play into the hands of harpies,
unless it accepts a few words of advice. When a
Bill is introduced, whatever the fate of its general
terms, the section relating to the reserve value being
made the surrender value is certain to be passed.
The moment the Bill is introduced harpies will, there-
fore, be let loose upon the public, and we will find
that policies will change hands for their low sur-
render values, with a small bait added. Thus, a
harpy may purchase for £3OO a policy that he could
draw £5OO for from the office a few weeks later. Or,
still better, he might then draw £3OO of the reserve
value in cash, and thus recoup himself for the pur-
chase of the policy, purchasing a fully-paid policy
for the remaining £2OO at absolutely no cost to him-
self. The necessary measure of protection to the public
may be provided by a short Bill enacting that,
pending the introduction of the general Bill on the sub-
ject of life assurance, the reserve value of policies
shall be the surrender value. That preliminary Bill
might be passed in the shortest time on record; and
if it could be passed for the protection of the public
against harpies, why not for their protection against
the insurance companies in respect of their arbitrarily
low surrender values, and why not also before the
House terminates the present session?”
The E., S. and A. Bank, having reached
the 8 p.c. dividend point, proposes to in future make
an interim (half viarlv) distribution ; but for the
present the little Jot to be sent out in May will be
3 p.c. only, leaving 5 p.c. to go out in November.
The Standard Oil and Coal Co. of Aus-
tralia is being formed in Melbourne to promote cos.
in every Australian State to prospect and bore for
oil, and otherwise prepare likely oil fields for develop-
ment. The prospectus claims that boring for petro-
leum oil has never been done properly in Australia,
although oil shale has been successfully treated. The
co. has secured options over eight likely-looking areas
in various States, and is‘in treaty for more. George
D. Meudell is the local author of the scheme, for
which The Bulletin has a benediction to spare. But
the prospectus would look better if the promoters and
vendors didn’t swallow half the shares. It seems an
excessive proportion. Still it would be far worse
if. they collared any of the capital, and they don’t
do that.
Shareholders in Great Britain tin
(N.S.W.) get a 34th div. (As.) for a Christmas box.
This will make £17,683 divided on a paid capital of
£5OOO, of which only about two-thirds was put up
in cash. Last half-year alone the profit rrn to £5903.
The exceptional price of tin has put a heavy coating
of gilt on the co.’s gingerbread. The average value re-
covered for the six months was 1.951 b. per yard, and
the profit was £12,873; so about 9s. in the £ was
available for dividends and depreciation. The latter
is, of course, heavy, partly owing to the excessive
wear and tear of the machinery, partly owing to the
short life of the tin ground on which the plant works.
As one area has been eaten up, it has hitherto been
possible to secure another; but there is a limit to
that sort of thing. Moore’s ground, the first of the
co.’s additions, will be worked out by about March.
The co.’s surplus of liquid assets over liabilities, as
at the end of October, was about £4500.

Recent developments in Baker’s Creek
(N.S.W.) have been a trifle more interesting, and the
northern end, from No. 11 downwards, is expected to
provide profitable crushing stuff from Smith’s and the
middle reef. Further south a branch vein off Smith’s
reef into the footwall is also attracting attention. In
No. 15 level there is a narrow, but rich, streak of
golden stone for 77ft. Such patches are characteris-
tic of the mine. A few months since, tributers
crushed 133 tons for 14440 z. from blocks that had
been missed in the old workings. The clean-up from
the two reefs at the north end and • the footwall vein
and from the cyaniding of tailings may enliven the
gamble, which has been very dreary while the 6d.
.calls have been on tap. No one can say whether calls
will not have to go oh, but anyhow shareholders will
; have more heart to pay up.
Though the Radium Hill Co.’s year ended
.on June 30, accounts are only just issued, and the
annual meeting is fixed for the 24th inst. Fortu-
nately the co.’s interesting history is brought almost
.up to date. On November 26 the co.’s chemist and
■works manager, S. Radcliff, submitted 21 milli-
grammes of radium bromide to Prof. Pollock, of
(Sydney University, and got a certificate that it pos-
sessed “a radio-activity equivalent to that of 1.38
milligrammes of pure radium bromide,” according
to the standard sample in the professor’s possession.
This sample is part of 305 milligrammes, more or
less extracted from 95 tons of concentrates. The
process is a long and tedious one, and the product
will only arrive at absolute purity (or as near thereto
as the co. will get it) at the rate of 30 milligrammes
per week. But what the co. is going to net for the
interesting substance is a matter about .which the
report is silent, though the managing director makes
his calculations on the basis of £l5 per milligramme.
Costs are put at about £3O per ton of concentrates,
whereas the latest samples showed a gross value of
£l2O to £145 per ton. Meantime, the fact that radium
can be produced from the co.’s ore having been
demonstrated, a scheme is to be submitted “to place
the financial position of the co. on a sound basis.”
Another £BOOO is wanted.

A Sydney metallurgist has produced an
aluminium alloy, of which great things are ex-
pected. Pure aluminium has many virtues, but it
has this bad defect —you can’t weid it. The alloy
retains the virtues of the metal, and, it is alleged,
gets over the other trouble, besides being exceptionally
hard. # * *
The Rockvale Wolfram Co., Torrington
(N.S.W.), has been marking time for a long while
now. It spent £ 13,000 on concentrating plant,
etc., with practically no ore opened out. About
70 tons of wolfram were won, but results were
just what might have been expected, and the show is
now let on tribute. The co.’s only hope seems to
be to develop sufficient ore to keep the concentrating
plant going on a full feed ; and even then the bad
arrangement of the plant will be a handicap.
* » * *
Associated Northern (W.A.) reports that
oxidised ore has been exposed in the No. 3 level of
its Ora Banda mine. The lode is 15ft. wide in the
crosscut, and assays 40s. for the first sft., 20s. for
the second, and Bs. for the third. The first 20ft. of
driving, has averaged 325. 6d. The difficulty with
the carbonates in the water is being overcome, and
future returns are expected to show a substantial
increase in yield and profit.
« * * *
Marvel Loch (W.A.) is persevering with
development, and results are stated to be “encourag-
ing.” By-and-bye, when the mill is again running
solely on the co.’s ore, a much better showing is
anticipated.
* * * *
On September 30 South Kalgurli (W.A.)
was estimated to have 252,400 tons of 235. lOd. ore
in sight, compared with 279,500 tons of 265. 9d.
stuff six months previously. During the interval
57,188 tons were treated for a recovery of £71,015,
at a cost of £58,869. This shows an extraction of
93 p.c. and a gross profit of £12,146. Should the
same recovery be maintained during the current six
months, and costs remain about the same, the profit
will average a little better than Is. per ton. At that
rate the present dividend cannot be maintained.
* * * *
Before 1910, Tindals (W.A.) was going
to make shareholders wealthy in no time. Then
chairman Dawson hedged a bit and stated that there
were 55.000 tons of lOdwt. and 35,000 tons
of sdwt. to Bdwt. ore, besides a probable
11,000 tons of Bdwt. ore in sight. In addition, driv-
ing was alleged to be going on in a big body of
lOdwt. ore, future returns were estimated at lOdwt.
per ton, and directly “a few dividends had been
paid” another 20 head of stamps (making 40 head
in all) were to be added to the plant. But alas!
returns for the ensuing 12 months averaged only
21s. Id. per ton, the big lOdwt. lode appeared to
have evaporated, and, after allowing for the 21,120
tons of ore extracted, there only remained, including
what had been developed in the interim, 21,175 tons
of a supposed value of 7dwt. per ton. What became
of the remainder of the reserves was not stated.
About the middle of this year the chairman went
to the West, and talked about great possibilities, and
tried to get a Government subsidy. Now he con-
fesses that the co. is on the rocks. It only re-
mains to be reiterated that, with the best of man-
agement, the show is a very doubtful speculation,
and with the present control it is hopeless.
* * * *
Greenmount (W.A.) has asked for ex-
emption so that it may realise on assets and let the
mine on tribute. The co. has worked some leases
near Southern Gross continuously since 1905, and
altogether has extracted and treated 67,000 tons for
a recovery of 18s. 2d. per ton. It is now without
funds, and as shareholders refuse to stump up any
more cash liquidation appears to be unavoidable.
* * * *
Golden Ridge (W.A.) is trying to better
itself. Values have gone from bad to worse in
depth, and, as the management is a bit pessimistic
about the future, a new show is being looked for.
Two have already been inspected, but results did not
warrant purchase. The co.’s financial position is
still satisfactory, cash assets aggregating nearly
£12,000.
* * * *
Gwalia Consolidated (W.A.) is flying an-
other kite. This time it proposes to raise £40,000'
either by loan or by a shilling assessment on the
800,000 issued shares. As previously stated, labora-
tory tests carried out on ore from the co.’s refractory
show at Wiluna indicated that, by roasting at a
comparatively low temperature and subsequent
cyanidation, “a very good extraction was obtained.”
This, it is alleged, has since been confirmed by re-
sults from an experimental plant. A lot of money
could be earned for shareholders if only the treat-
ment problem could be solved; but there have been
so many failures and so much money lost that nearly
everyone interested is a bit dubious about the success
of the present attempt.
Twelve months ago H. C. Hoover said he
saw no reason why the newly amalgamated Lake
View and Oroya Exploration should not have a net
income of between £125,000 and £150,000 per
annum on a subscribed capital of £360,054, on:
which £llO,OOO would provide a 30 p.c. div.
Hoover was not present at the shareholders’ meeting
held in London the other day, but the other manag-
ing director, F. A. Govett, proposed putting the co.
on a 10 p.c. basis, which means only 5 p.c. for those
who joined the amalgamation, as shares were reduced
from £1 to 10s. Govett estimated the revenue for
the current year at £90,000, and as a 10 p.c. div.
will only take £36,000, exactly £54,000 will be
kept back from shareholders. This policy of hanging
on to profits in order to amass a big reserve for
speculative purposes, has been adopted for some years'
past by Govett, first in the case of the Ivanhoe and
then with the Lake View; and, owing to losses in
foreign wild cat ventures, the result has not usually
been to the benefit of shareholders. A shareholder
argued that out of a revenue of £90,000 share-
holders should get considerably more than £36,000,.
but Govett only shook his head and would not pro-
mise more. All he said was that as soon as the de-
velopment in the mines in which the co. is interested
justifies a different allocation, “then we can treat the-
matter from a different point of view.”
* * * *
Values have righted to some extent in the
bottom workings of Sons of Gwalia (W.A.), and but
for reasons which can’t yet be put into print, shares:
would be valued at a bit more than they are.
Manager Jack McDermott has, after six years’ service,
been retired, and is off to London to shake things up.
* * * *
Bullrush (W.A.) and its protegd, Kyarra,
held meetings at Adelaide the other day, when the-
heads expressed satisfaction with the outlook and
hoped to see prospects improve. The mill on the
former co.’s Royal Standard mine was stated to be
doing well, and ore treatment was declared to be
leaving a small profit. As regards the Kyarra, a re-
port furnished by the manager stated that good
crushing results would be obtained from the start,
and that there was every reason to believe that the
co. possessed a mine of considerable value.
* * * *
Mount Elliott’s annual report shows that
39,933 tons of ore gave an average of 13.12 p.c. cop-
per and 4.7dwt. gold. The net profit, after writing
off £14,770 for depreciation and £9983 for develop-
ment, was £158,443, which is less than £4 per ton
of ore. Reckoning future net profits at the same £4
per ton, the reserves are absurdly weak, for 70,000'
tons at £4 give £280,000, against a market value
of £1,200,000 (£8 per share). This weakness of
reserves in the parent mine explains Mount Elliott’s
undisguised anxiety to pick up good-looking shows.
The management has adopted a plucky policy, but it
is well to remember that the development of new
copper mines mops up a lot of money, and the cash
resources are for that reason not as big as they look.
Brilliant Deeps, Charters Towers, crushed
389 tons for £2724, an average of £7 per ton, com-
pared with £5 13s. lOd. from the previous crushing.
This improvement, together with the assurance that
larger crushings will soon be sent to the mill, has
put a little more heart into the share market, albeit
it is still far less enthusiastic than it used to be.
The general rule that a reef gets poorer as it goes
down is so far reversed in the Deeps, for the upper
crust above No. 4 gets poorer as they rise above
the level, and No. 2 has not so far. proved to be
much good. The horizontal extension of No. 4 to
the south-west is limited to 300 ft., for the end of
the level is close to the Brilliant Blocks. What
length the pay shoot will have in No. 5 level re-
mains to be proved, and the future depends very
much on the development of this level and the ground
below 2600 ft. The strong shoot of stone proved
below No. 2 on the hanging-wall reef also awaits
development; and it is quite possible that this sec-
tion will turn out well. It was a hanging-wall reqf
90ft. or more from the main reef that stood so well
to Mills’ United, and the Freehold ; but these rich
shoots are always fragmentary at the Towers.
* * * *
As the year closes Mills’ United, Charters
Towers, shells out a sixpenny, costing £7500. There
are 300,000 shares, and the cash in hand amounts to
over £30,000, or 2s. per share. Unfortunately
prospects are not what they were, and deep sinking
below 2600 ft. (vertical) is expensive.
* * * *
Brilliant Extended, Charters Towers,
made a profit of £4552 last half-year. To get that
the mill had to treat 16,700 tons of stone, so the
average is poor. After wiping off the overdraft the
half-year closed with a credit of £1716. Costs aver-
aged £1 17s. 2.4 d. per ton. Prospects depend on
uncertain deeper developments and the extension of
the eastern levels.
Papuan Brilliant and Victoria, Charters
Towers, pays Out 3d., and has also wiped off the £5OO
loan received from the State. This good turn of for-
tune comes from the Moonstone reef and branch
veins. Next year both the Papuan and the Queen
Cross, next door, are expected to shake things up on
the Moonstone.
“Northern Shareholder” : If, as no doubt is
the case, the Mount Oxide is short of money, I would
suggest a revision of the salary list. There are now
25 workmen, including 10 contract miners, three
other miners and an aboriginal or two. To boss this
little lot costs, I should judge, quite one-half as much
as the wages; I run management exes, out at about
£5OOO a year, of which more than £3OOO is spent
on the mine. The ore being broken is wonderfully
rich (there are now 150 tons of 50 p.c. and 4000
tons of 20 p.c. ore at grass, and the bottom winze
is in 6ft. of 40 p.c. ore) ; but the co. isn’t in a con-
dition to waste money.
Great Fitzroy (Q.) has got its nose
around the corner; the estimated revenue for Novem-
ber was £17,333, while working exes, were £15,818.
But there are a few pieces to come out of that small
surplus before any morsel is available for share-
holders.

The overloaded and overwatered Hydro-
Electric Co., of Tasmania, has been allowed two
months in which to get in the further capital that is
necessary for its salvation. Debenture-holders applied
the other day for the appointment of a receiver, and
the foregoing was the reply. The directors don’t ap-
pear to be very hopeful, though Gillies, the optimistic
promoter, still has an idea that all is not lost.
Paul Northey and Langford’s Briseis Ex-
tended, which flashed meteorically during the tin
boom of 1905-6, is being resurrected as the West
Briseis. Tom Brannon, assisted by Hobart financing,
is boring the ground, which has been held for a
long while by a Derby syndicate. Fuel cost the
Extended about 7s. per ton, and worked with steam
the proposition must be an utter failure, but the
idea of a hydro-electric scheme is under considera-
tion, the power to be drawn from the Forester
River with an available 210 h.p., less induction and
loss in transmission. The ground, some of which is
unbottomed at 110 ft., will, however, require far
snore power than that. And, anyhow, it isn’t at
all certain that the property contains a lead really
worth having.

The old Weldbrook (Tas.) was a counle
■of years ago refloated under the name of the Rio
•Grande, the money being put up in Launceston. The
(CO. has now closed down after an expenditure of some
£l5OO for a recovery of about two tons of oxide.

The vacuum-filter slime-treatment plant
<of the Australian Tailings Co., on the Magdala-cwm-
Moonlight slimes heap at Stawell (Vic.), has been
sold by auction for £2OOO, the co. having tired of
the attempt to make bulk results come up to labora-
tory tests. As the 200 h.p. suction gas-engines
cost more than the £2OOO, and as there is a com-
plete filter plant, with vortex mixers, tube mill, and
pans for treating the material before it goes to the
agitators, the price is not likely to make the share-
holders wildly jubilant. It is understood the plant
was purchased by the Magdala-cum-Moonlight Co.,
in order to try another fall with the slimes. The
co. has at any rate got a very complete and up-to-
date plant to tackle the problem with, and got it
at something like a quarter of the actual cost. There
is plenty of gold in the slimes. The only trouble is
to get it out.

A Melbourne co. sports the name of
Infusorial Earth Co., with a capital of £7500. Ob-
jects are to acquire 49 acres of diatomaceous deposit
near Portland (Vic.). Diatomaceous earth is wrongly
called infusorial, but in this instance it is truly
Fuller’s earth. For the benefit of those who might
interpret the co.’s formation as a prophecy of a large
increase in population shortly, as the result of the
Maternity Bonus Bill, it may be as well to explain
that there are other, and far more important, uses.
Diatomaceous earth is used in the manufacture of
pottery and statuary, gold edges, papier mflche, dyna-
mite, putty, fertilisers, soap adulterants, caoutchouc
and carbolic acid preparations. Being a non-con-
ductor of heat and electricity, it is also employed
for insulating purposes. In Germany it is used for
■water purification. In America its chief use is as an
abrasive or for polishing, powder. The largest de-
posit in the world is probably in California. The
Californian production, last year, of 2194 tons, was
valued at $19,670, or about 375. per ton. To be
valuable it needs to be pure. The Victorian deposit
has been proved for 25ft. deep, and driven on for over
■6oft. ; it is going strong in both faces. Samples are
said to contain 90.4 p.c. silica, and to be free from
-potash and soda. But whether the deposit has an im-
mediate local economic value remains to be proved.

R. L. Jack has reported on the Cowell
(S.A.) silver discovery. The ore is rich, but the
■deepest hole is only a few feet down on a vein
•claimed to be up to 3ft. wide. The field was origin-
ally unsuccessfully opened for copper; the silver lode
was an afterthought. And as might be expected on
a field within 1000 miles of King William-street,
“pegging is active.”
Subscriber: Can’t answer in a general
way like that. For instance, the metal recovery at
the B. H. South is 57i p.c. of the silver and 70 p.c.
of the lead, while at the B. H. Block 10 it is only
42 p.c. of the silver and 68i p.c. of the lead. And
costs are equally divergent.... Bullion: (1) Take too
much space to explain here; it was dealt with in B.
l/2/’l2 and l/8/’l2, and will probably be touched on
at the next post-mortem in February. (2) Think so.
... .K.R.: The views may be all right; but we’re shy
of the opinions of admitted stock-jobbers.

“Inquirer”: Can anybody tell me anything
of the present position of the Iron, Steel and
Metals Manufacturing Co., Ltd. ? It has an office
(nominally) and a secretary (nominally) ; but the
office, if it exists, neither answers nor acknowledges
inquiries. For two years no word of the co. has ever
reached me or any other shareholder or debenture
holder that I can hear of, and no information can
be obtained. It is believed here that the co. is
dead, and no longer exists. If so, it would surely be
only decent on the part of the directors to bury it
in due form, and advise the sorrowing share and
debenture holders, so that they might at least have a.
chance of attending the funeral.
A great mistake, when erecting new works or re 1
arranging old ones, is often made in constructing the
building and installing machinery ere looking round!
for means of transport of the raw material, half-
manufactured and finished goods. Messrs. Adolf
Bleichert and Co., of London, have issued various
catalogues and leaflets, illustrating and describing a
few of the many transport systems and plants which
they have supplied, and which show the solution of
the transport question and the advantages of em-
ploying such appliances. W. and J. Lempriere,
Melbourne and Sydney, are the Australian representa-
tives, and would be pleased to hear from those in-
terested. A specially trained engineer is retained to
consult and advise.*


Charles Heidsieck Champagne. —With
the approach of Christmas a call for “Charlie”
is on the increase, and the well-known ham-
pers in which the champagne is packed are
much in evidence at picnic parties both on
land and water. The wine is a favorite, and
everyone drinking it knows that they are
drinking a wine of the only Heidsiecks now
in the business, the firm, M. Charles Heid-
sieck with his brother Henri, being the only
male descefldants of the original Florens
Heidsieck who are now in the champagne
trade. We recommend all our readers not to
let the festive ’season pass without quaffing
this sparking liquor (the produce of Rheims)
which keeps up to its motto of “ne plus
ultra.”*

A
WOMAN'S
LETTER
Sydney, December 16, 1912.
My Dear Arinx. —
All the elements of melodrama were pre-
sent when the State Government resumed
formal possession of old Government House
on Saturday. A small regiment of police
guarded the openings in the fence that were
later to admit the People with a wild rush.
AVaiting for the magic hour when the chief
conspirators should take to the stage inside
the grounds, Domain orators addressed
mixed gatherings of plain citizens and cave-
dwellers from Mrs. Macquarie’s Chair. “If
this thing,” yelled one of the cave-dwellers,
‘‘hadn’t er been done” (loud applause),
“we’d er had a slave market on ther Circ’lar
Quay.” Yells of frantic applause, inter-
larded with furious remarks about the pre-
sence of the police. Another orator held
forth on the crime of owning polo ponies.
An interjector of the cave-dweller species
hurled a bitter remark at this speaker. “If
Holman hadn’t kicked ’im out, we’d be told
to eat grass same as the polo ponies.” “I’m
blowed if I know what the row’s about,”
said a plain citizen.
When the rope fell and a man in the
crowd suggested a hanging, Ministers of the
Crown, beaming with smiles upon the People,
made a dramatic entry. When they reached
the little wooden stage under the shade of a
huge tree, neither friend nor foe would give
the Benefactors a chance of speaking. A
derisive yell of laughter greeted the toy
Union Jack—the size of a penny-dip flag—•
which Premier .McGowen waved in one
hand. “Down with kings and aristocrats,”
bawled the Marat of the crowd—“chuck
that rag away!” Here and there, the
Domain orator could be seen gathering his
followers for mighty cheers to drown the
opposition hoots.
In a fnifly peaceful moment, Premier
McGowen explained the sentiments which
had urged his Government to “evict” the
Governor-General. Messrs. Holman and
Griffith, standing side by side on the little
plank of execution, chuckled and chatted to-
gether. “You’ve cooked your goose this
Christmas, Jimmy,” was the post-mortem
remark of a long, thin citizen who forced
his way to the edge of the plank. A rush
towards ex-Government House followed.
But the doors were securely closed, and the
white cotton gloves of the Law were ready
to seize any patriot who smashed the glass
panes thereof. Then the oratory fizzled out,
and the melodrama became as flat as yester-
day’s pancakes.
Gentle Mayoress Florence Clarke, who
was beginning to put away her fears of the
awe-inspiring billet, had rather bad luck in
being pushed off her throne so soon. Her
papa, Mayor Clarke, who is now passing
into the chrysalis or alderman stage again,
had only six months or so of office. In this
brief reign he stopped our incidental at-
tempts to stab total strangers with the ends
of our hatpins, he put a brake on the muni-
cipal coach, which was dashing downhill in
pursuit of borrowed money, and he nearly
worried us to death in the matter of com-
mitting used tram tickets to rest in their
official bunks at every street corner.
Mrs. Cocks, the Mayoress-to-be when the
old. year has breathed into its last penny
whistle, has been more or less turned inside
out in voluminous interviews. We now
know most of her personal habits. She runs
well in double harness, has no trouble with
her servants, had relatives who were once in
“public life” (a late uncle is mentioned as
having been a Victorian Minister of Cus-
toms), and has been bitten by the germ that
incites our species to run up and down the
face of the earth. When she doesn’t want
to travel, she likes fancy-work and the do-
mestic hearth, and is somewhat given to
gardening. I hope she hates snails,
which, eat up most of the amateur gardener’s
green feed in suburban grass plots. If she
will hand out a really reliable recipe for
snaring domestic help for humble homes that
are so careless as to encourage the presence
of children, she will be forgiven for saying:
“The chief reason for trouble with servants,
is that they are not treated properly.”
The handmaiden who would stay for longer
than the time required to put on her best
hat where she was not properly treated is
as common as speckled bunyips these days.
Above the squeak of the breaking-up
school fiddle and through the orgy of
speeches by distinguished persons, rises the
wail of the rebellious parent. Most of the
more expensive private schools give three
months’ holiday in a year, not to mention
the odd days that fall into the lap of youth
between tiie regular breaking-up seasons.
Every Christmas fierce rumors of a Parents’
Protection Society, or something of the
kind,- rush round the outskirts of the noble
sentiments which a titled visitor hurls at
the breaking-up boy. This year a League
of Indignant Mothers was beginning to
materialise when the price of potatoes fell
suddenly and saved a financial crisis. Until
that happened, the thought of paying for
Johnny’s meals at a boarding-school, while
feeding him at home for eight weeks at a
stretch on the uppish mutton chop and
almost priceless fruits of the soil, made the
maternal brow as black as ink.
The breaking-up of most consequence
this year was at Argyle School. Miss
Baxter, who practically pioneered in this
city a higher standard of girls’ education,
nearly 40 years ago, has been a kind of
feminine monument of fixed purpose. She
dared to take hold of a school for “young
ladies,” in an unfashionable suburb, in an
era when fancy-work, the dates of the Eng-
lish kings, and an intelligent acquaintance
with the life of Charles XII. of Sweden <in
the French language) made up the bulk of a
young lady’s instruction. The Baxter pupils
leapt to the front with a profound know-
ledge of all those things the girls of that
period were supposed to know nothing about.
Other private schools had to scramble to
line. Now the famous Argyle School is
closed, and the great teacher sits back to
rest.
A Sydney patriarch looks over his spec-
tacles and tells me this:—
A ladies’ school, which had been in existence in
Sydney for nearly 60 j'ears, closed its doors with the
Christmas vacation. In the ’so’s Mrs. Frost conducted a
“seminary” in Crown-street, between Fitzroy and
Foveaux streets. She continued there until 1873,
when Miss E. C. Baxter took up the running, and car-
ried the work on in the old house until 1876, when
she removed to Albion-street, and stayed there until
Thursday last. Then she finally gave up teaching.
In the large assembly-room—crowded to excess by
“old girls” and “young girls”—Miss Baxter, in a
speech replete with memories, pathetic and heroic,
took leave of her pupils and friends, and bade them
show their loyalty to the old school in honorable and
useful lives. After prize-distributing there was a
meeting of “old girls” to form a union, mainly for
the purpose of endowing a cot in the Children’s Hos-
pital, to be named “The Emily C. Baxter Cot.” In
the room £lOO was promised, much of it subscribed
there and then. About 1800 “old girls” have passed
through the school, and these will be asked to interest
themselves in the excellent memorial.
Bowral, Moss Yale and Burradoo are
gathering up the summer-boarder and the
country cottager who salaams before the
vice-regal camp at Sutton Forest. Far
from the limp north-easter which takes the
curl out of your collar, the Woolocracy will
chase the golf ball and follow the mild
flutter of picnic races. Most of our local
nobility have already decamped to their
summer eyries in the southern highlands.
In another week or two we shall be able to
read what the Dangars, Osbornes, Allens
and Stephen tribe did or didn’t wear while
the Bong Bong Cup winner met the judge’s
eye. And if the cup were a mere pannikin
it wouldn’t matter so long as the Sydney
lady can absorb, with starting eyes, the
thrilling news that Mrs. Fat Mutton wore
pale white relieved with dark black and a
streak of lean in her lingerie.
There has been the usual Christmas out-
pouring of wrath among the musical tribes
of this city. The cause is the swollen charge
for the hire of the Town Hall on special oc-
casions. H. N. Southwell chanced to be the
successful tenderer for the municipal hall
on the coming Christmas night—a streak of
luck which will cost him £65 for rent and
incidentals.
The Highland Society, which hands out
the proceeds of its annual rally to charity
(with a Scotch accent), has been bumped
out of the Town Hall on New Year’s night.
Not to be bumped too hard, the Society
has seized New Year’s Eve as an alterna-
tive, and will give a “Hogmanay” in the hall
on that date. After circumventing this wild
animal, it will double its efforts with a
screech of the pipes in the Exhibition Build-
ing on January 1. On January 2 the com-
mittee will be taken home on shutters, for a
day of Highland Sports is sandwiched be-
tween the Hogmanay and the other out-
break.
The Sydney Phil., which used to look
upon the Town Hall as its own on Christmas
night, has now transferred “The Messiah”
to an afternoon performance on that day.
Some long-headed member thought out this
plan last December, observing that the civic
claw had not, as yet, reached out for pro-
hibitive rent for a Christmas Day matinee.
The Symphony Orchestral concert in the
Town Hall last week had no luck with the
weather. J. Pluvius descended heavily on
the water-proofed and the merely-wet pedes-
trian. Proceeds of the concert were to go
to the Mount Lyell Disaster Fund, and
deserts of empty chairs were a bleak response
to the call for cash. Conductor Bradley
placed Chopin’s “Marche Funbbre” first on
the programme. The prelude to “Lohen-
grin” (Wagner) was a fine performance, fol-
lowed by a snack of Good Friday music from
“Parsifal.” Etta Gibson, the soloist of the
afternoon, stepped in at this juncture, and
sang the aria, “Softly Awakes My Heart,”
which had been recently on the lips of Kirkby
Lunn. Miss Gibson ought to keep off this
aria till she attends to the tremolo in her
lower register. Wagner was supplied in
liberal helpings, and the famous Tschai-
kowsky overture, “1812,” completed a con-
cert which was successful in everything but
cash receipts.
The recent fete in aid of the South Syd-
ney Hospital introduced hot coffee gratis as
a special attraction. It was given away by
nice-looking damsels as the Town Hall
entertainment was about to be locked up for
the night. Men are so accustomed to be
vigorously fleeced for charity that one or
two youths nearly swallowed the cup when
they were told the coffee was to cost exactly
nothing. Workers belonged, like most of the
buyers, to the districts of Waterloo, Alex-
andria, Botany and other parts in which
the South Sydney Hospital cares for those
who fall by the way. The fete was not a
financial boom, though there’s likely to be a
solid helping of cash left after the trimmings
have been paid for.
In consequence of the weeping skies, New-
town had to wear goloshes on the chief
show-day in its jubilee week. The Chelms-
fords took a hand, and the oldest inhabitant
trotted out her reminiscences of the bad old
days. Our sex can note with a stiffening of
its backbone that the oldest inhabitant is
often a sprightly dame of 90 winters or so,
and very active on her feet.
Mrs. Windeyer, the widow of the late
Judge of that well-known name, died the
other day at Tomago, on the Hunter River.
She lived to see the platform woman become
a daily habit in this State. Though her
earlier efforts in public speaking were always
in the cause of charity, Mrs. Windeyer had
none of the aggressive virtues which often
make a modern committee room hum with
the throb of biting personalities. She stood
with mild and unobtrusive manner for all
that was best in the mid-Victorian dame.
Mrs. Mark Albery, who died last week at
Stanmore in her 91st year, was a very old
colonist, whose husband was well known in
the commercial life of Sydney. He was a
member of the firm of Hodgson and Albery,
importers of carpets and floor coverings,
whose place of business was in George-
street, on a site now covered by David Jones’.
Mrs. Albery left two sons, one the well-
known ritualist cleric, attached for some
years to Christ Church, and now in Eng-
land ; the other a bank manager.
Dorothy Dix, of the large, black, velvet
eyes, is off to try her luck in Uncle Sam’s
dominions. For a young woman who isn’t
old enough to have a vote, Dorothy’s luck
has had a silver lining. At the precocious
age of 17 she was leading lady with Lewis
Waller. Since then, a slim, willow-wand
figure and a handsome face have helped to
push the youngster into well-paid billets. A
ray of intelligence is a minor asset compared
with the Importance of Being Beautiful.
Irene Browne, the brainy youngster who
came back to Sydney to play in “Mile-
stones,” is another instance of the triumph
of youth. This girl, who likes an “e” at the
end of her Brown, but doesn’t worry about
it if it isn’t there, has walked swiftly into a
fat part while still an infant in the eyes of
the Law.
Mrs. Slapoffski, who knows the vocal art
from A to Z and back again, was engaged to
play Marguerite in a Quinlan production of
“Faust” in the English provinces. I hear
she has tried to lure Slap, from these parts,
but he swears by Australian sunshine, and
refuses to budge. Slap., by the way, swears
(for a musician) very little, and has the
reputation of being the most patient conduc-
tor who ever dragged a chorus on to the
right note. As a boy, he was an infant
prodigy, and toured with Sims Reeves as a
solo fiddler in knickerbockers.
Singer Andrew Black and his wife went
off to Auckland in the Makura. A few con-
certs will be mingled with the summer holi-
day.
A. B. Hector’s next public experiment in
“color-music” will be chained on to the organ
in the Town Hall on December 21.
Lawyer Freddie Wood marries the very
dainty Elsie Goodyear this week, and last
Saturday a selection of his friends —incur-
able bachelors, married men and grass
widowers —dined him at Paris House. I
am told they also wined themselves, but
don’t believe it. Even if men do sit at
dinner for five hours it must be on account
of the speeches and the inability to tear
themselves away from the guest of the even-
ing. The Woods go to Tasmania, leaving
here by the Orama.
Dr. and Mrs. Wallace Weihen have been
honeymooning in Tasmania, with the aid of
a petrol chariot. She was the graceful
bride, Elsie Barbara Macadam, whose wed-
ding finery caused such a flutter in the
feminine breast a few weeks ago. The
Weihens return to this town before Christ-
mas. By the way, the Lady Martin from
whose husband. Sir Theodore, the Macadams
got their wealth a few years ago. was before
marriage the celebrated Helen Faucit, per-
haps the greatest Shakspearian actress of
all time.
Dr. G. A. Marshall’s eldest daughter.
Dorothy, is engaged to a fifth-year medical
student at Sydney Uni. His name is Bet-
tington Moore, and he hails from. Tasmania,
where the Moore family own Maria Island,
once upon a time a military outpost.
“Florodora,” a few years older, is illus-
trating the perpetual youth of Grace Pal-
otta. As Lady Ilolyrood she is as pert and
pretty as she was 10 years ago, and to all
appearance not five minutes older. And her
clothes to-day are as impossible to imitate
as they were when “Florodora” was a
youngster a few weeks old. Have you
noticed the touch of black that she uses with
a cunning hand in all her rag creations? A
vision in rose drapery (Act I.), she perches
a daring black hat, turned up in front at an
angle of about 114 degrees, on her saucy
head. In an elaborate garment, later on, she
is up to all kinds of sartorial dodges with
hlmy black lace.
Her Majesty’s was full to the skylights on
( liff’i 111 spite of the counter-attraction
or Milestones at th.e Cri, Between nets
opera glasses were trained on to the frock
or a dark-haired woman in a stage box.
lhere wasn't too much material about the
neck but elsewhere there seemed to be
nearly everything, including a chain of dia-
monds, the heart of woman could desire,
lhere was a tiny lace pinafore, and elab-
orate mixtures of rose and indeterminate
shades of contrasting silk, and a black vel-
vet waistband, and a slender swathe' of skirt,
and a pair of white arms, and an ermine
wrap on an adjacent chair. Mrs. Suburbs
can only ache all over in silence when she
gazes at these luxuries of life.
The British sword is beginning to jingle
fairly often in the Dominion forces. Cap-
tain C. Collins, of the Berkshire Regiment,
a passenger in the Malwa from London,
went ~o n i oin th e fighting strength of
Maonland. He carries with him, as excess
luggage, the prefix of “The Hon.”
M.L. Minister of Finance Allan, with his
wife and daughter, put up at the Australia
before hurrying on to Melbourne by express.
The Minister is hard on the trail of our
English Uncle, who is rather coy just now,
and needs courting in person. Private Sec.
F. Matthews accompanies the financial ex-
plorer.
Ex-Attorney-General John Findlay arrives
here this week from the Dominion. He,
you’ll remember, was the Maoriland poli-
tician who achieved a knighthood when
Ward fished in the “Home” waters and
landed a baronetcy.
Admiral Ross, a veteran U.S. tar, is
another visitor who steps ashore in this
port as I write. A daughter navigates her
Saratoga in the wake of papa.
Mr. and Mrs. Essex R. Picot (he is man-
aging director of Wm. Docker, Ltd) are
due back in Sydney by the end of this
month. They have had a year’s interesting
wander through Egypt and Europe, and
when last heard of were at the Hotel Man-
hattan, which is one of the places where
Uncle Samuel charges you about two-dollars-
fifty for the most splintery slice off his
woodenest ham.
Mrs. Stout, wife of Maoriland’s Chief
Justice, passed by recently on her way
from London to the Dominion, where she
has a solid reputation for good works. She
seems to have had a severe attack of suf-
fragitis during her long stay in the Thames •
vilage. During a holiday scamper through
Geyserland, I once had a few words in the
benign dame’s ear-trumpet (she used to be
moderately deaf), and only dragged forth
a few inquiries re the morals of Sydney and
the methods of the Y.W.C.A. in this port.
However, she always found time to cultivate
a thirst for female franchise, in sDite of the
M.L. domestic problem, which occasionally
compels a Mrs. Chief Justice to personally
interview her own saucepans.
Early in the coming year, Captain Rol-
leston, R.N., who looks like an understudy
of Wellington of Waterloo, hands over his
little kingdom at Garden Island to Captain
Henderson, of H.M.S. Penguin. This tame
sea-bird is mostly a marine surveyor, and
has crept warily along all the foreshores of
Australasia, to plumb the secrets of the
depths. So Captain Henderson ought to
know as much about the length of a mer-
maid’s tail as any other “salt.”
P. W. Marony has been showing a very
mixed assortment of his artistic wares in an
upper room opposite Paling’s, in George-
street. Water-color, pastels and oils are
“amongst those present.” The water-color
section is much the best. A few really
charming impressionist sketches reveal a
brush very different from that which perpe-
trated “Falls at Katoomba,” yet all are the
same man’s work. “By Tuggerah Lake,”
“Mountain Saplings,” “The Hillside Even-
ing,” and others in the same soft mood, are
worth a better chance of meeting the public
eye than their present unlovely abode af-
fords.
An interior of an old house at Norfolk
Island is interesting for its story. It is the
home of the John Nobbs family, whose roots
have grown in that Isle of Pines for half a
century or more. In doing up the old house
a while back, the paint and plaster were
scraped off the walls ; and Mrs. Nobbs, the
“Aunt Sarah” of the island, told Marony
that deeply cut in the stone was the name
“Rufus Dawes.” Hidden for years under
the lick of paint, it suddenly met the eye as
a possible lurid link with the murky past. The
story is so good that one hopes it happens
to be true. If so, Marcus Clarke’s hero
may have helped to build the room in which
to-day a lady is depicted amongst her sauce-
pans. Potatoes have been peeled before now
on the threshold of tragedy.
Mr. E. A. Llughes and his pretty wife
and infant have come back to town after, a
snack of Blue Mountain scenery inlaid with
golf. Be recently bought Carthona, which
used to be the Willie Mitchells’ abode on the
water-lapped edge of Darling Point.
Yours affectionately,
VANDORLAN.

1,000,000 COPIES SOLD OF THE POPULAR
“BOOKSTALL” SERIES of AUSTRALIAN NOVELS
Written, Illustrated and Printed in Australia.
THE TRADER.
Adventure in New Guinea.
By CECIL ROSS-JOHNSON.
With Six Full-Page Illustrations.
PRICE 1/-; POSTAGE Id.
“The Trader” is one of the most fascinating books of adventure yet . published, and some
of the chapters would be hard to beat for tense dramatic situations and vivid word-painting.
The young Australian explorers who invade New Guinea in search of pearls, copra and
rubber meet a series of adventures, or misadventures, sufficient to satisfy the most voracious
appetite. The description of the man who keeps the last bullet for his mate, who has been
captured by cannibals, is worth the money itself, and the story of the trader who has been
dynamited beyond recognition, and who prays his comrades to put an end to his suffering, opens
up some fine points regarding legal murder and common-sense humanity. Altogether a book
out of the common.
The Dawsons’ Uncle Georg'e
By SUMNER LOCKE, Author of “ Mum Dawson, Boss.”
Illustrated by G. C. Pearce. PRICE 1/-; POSTAGE Id.
When “Mum Dawson, Boss,” appeared about nine months ago, it was apparent that
Australia still had some clever writers left, and the reading public endorsed _ that view by
buying up the first edition in record time. This new book runs on similar lines, and fully
maintains the author’s reputation for keen insight into our Australian bush life, and for that
happy, rippling humor and genial fun that delighted us in the first book. In many respects
“The Dawsons’ Uncle George” shows the improvement that comes from experience, and ought
to be heartily welcomed by “Mum Dawson’s” admirers and the rest.
BASE BRANDS.
By H. M. SOMER. With Eight Illustrations by Lionel Lindsay.
PRICE 1/-; POST FREE 1/1.
Mr. Somer is the popular secretary of the Royal Agricultural Society of N.S.W., and a man
who is recognised as an authority on the horse and the bush, a combination in which most
Australians take a keen and abiding interest.
In “Base Brand” he has produced a book of uncommon merit, full of the dashing adven-
tures that accompanied sheep stealing and cattle duffing in the early days, yet not wanting
in the threads of romance that are always interwoven with the episodes of human life. His
portrayal of Captain Rundall, the daririg hero with the dual personality, is an admirable piece
of work that will appeal strongly to lovers of bush romance.
Are now obtainable at all Branches and Bookstalls of the
N.S.W. BOOKSTALL CO. LTD.,
476 George Street, Sydney; and all Booksellers.

MELBOURNE CHATTER.
Melbourne, December 16, 1912.
My Dear Yarrie, —
The Fuller lady made an informal but
triumphant progress through Gippsland into
the Lake Country, where placid sheets of
water, networks of river, rich flats and high
mountain jumbles make magnificent scenery.
It is not exactly a motorist’s paradise, and,
after getting bogged a few times, his Ex.
turned back to Melbourne. But his lady went
gaily on, even unto distant Dargo, where she
helped to install the new Bush Nurse. With
her, in the mud-crusted motor, went Dr. Jean
Greig, Dr. Edith Barrett, and the charitable
Miss Dalie Michaelis. The installation cere-
monies included a church service, and two
new Dargonians were christened ip the vice-
regal presence. Her Ex. stood godmother to
both the pink young Australians, cuddling
them in motherly fashion at the font. Dargo
is still seething with excitement over the
great doings, and people are rushing up and
down mountains to try to work it off. The
new nurse meanwhile looks on and waits for
one of them to fall. She is Miss Amy Brown,
a newly-arrived Englishwoman who was in-
duced to venture this way by Dr. J. W.
Barrett. The brief fortnight or so she had
in Melbourne was spent in learning how to
steer and navigate a horse.
The Fullers intend spending the summer
holidays at the vice-regal refuge at Upper
Macedon. Gentlemen Helps Wheatley and
'Curwen go with them, but Secretary Wil-
Iberforce stays behind to keep house and
•wave off wandering bottle merchants. They
•return in February, when Auntie Phipps
leaves for India, to take up the job of house-
Skeeper to brother Charlie, who is a subal-
tern in the Old Hundredth, or some equally
well-known regiment.
Gaud Mayor Hennessy gave a little mid-
day party at the Town Hall to welcome the
cadets from the Belgian training ship. Mrs.
Hennessy, surmounted by a bird-of-paradise
hat, helped receive in her blue and gold
rooms, which were decorated with wonderful
purple iris from the Alexandra Avenue beds.
The hostess speaks French fluently, and she
had thoughtfully gathered all her French-.
chattering friends so that the visitors could
exercise tongues as well as hands. When the
time came to respond to the complimentary
speeches, Captain Corneille proved that his
English was seaworthy. Defence-Minister
Pearce and the Mayor had both referred to
Belgium as “that little nation across the
Channel.” The captain worked this
into his graceful reply: “You call
us a little country. We are a small
country; but we number 8,000,000, and we
can all fight.” Then everyone looked
thoughtful. The cadets . are fine-looking
youngsters, who cheer vimfully whenever
they hear their king. mentioned—or see his
name on a cigar box.
Mrs. Bonython, the newly-married May-
oress of Adelaide, was a charming presence
in g-ev bridal toggery. Her quite-youthful
liL‘-'iand had returned thanks for his unop-
posed re-election on Monday, and the wed-
.ding happened on Wednesday.
There was a strong flow of society to the
Hast Repertory Theatre season and a parti-
■ cularly fierce inrush of vice-royalty. The
Denmans (who were billed officially for
Tuesday) dropped in unexpectedly on Fri-
• day to see “Man and Superman,” while the
Fullers occupied the padded seats on Satur-
• day. On Tuesday, the G.-G. household, with
■the visiting Islingtons and other guests, came
: along, as arranged, to see “The Pigeon.”
'They all wore parade dress, and the diamond
[glare in front was so fierce that the per-
iformers were almost forced to get behind
isnow-goggles. The club now wants to fix up
tthe membership again (minimum 400 at a
guinea) for the New Year. The
theatre plays only 12 nights a year;
yet even if every night sees a full
house, the cashbox yawns for more. So
the membership must go up. As the last
shows were a distinct success, the outlook is
bright. The Repertory co. leaves this week
for Tasmania. Hobart is to have a two-
weeks season and Launceston one week. The
box-office baits are “Chains.” “Makeshifts,”
“The Pigeon,” “Man and Superman,” and
the rollicking “John Gabriel Borkman.”
The Shakspeare Society indulged in prize-
giving last week, when the Denman lad.v sup-
plied a honeyed smile with each reward.
The G.-G. was to have done it, but he was
unlucky enough to be caught bv a cold, and
so had to take his gruel at home. Dr. Deeper,
Henry Gyles Turner and Sugden. of Qiieen’s
College, acted as supers during the presenta-
tion scene. Ardent Shakspearian students
played portions of “The Tempest.” and other
fanatics filled the Athenaeum Hall with rant
attention. Some maidens, coached by Mrs.
Green, appeared in The Masque, and Amadio
melodiously fluted .Vie accompaniments to
Ariel’s songs. William has been nearly 300
years dead. The tercentenary occurs in
three years, and the society is just dying to
give the deceased a statue in Melbourne.
The Alliance Frangaise turned its most
recent soiree into a Christmas prize-distribu-
tion. Eileen Starr, Mamie Roach, and the
little O’Shaugnassy girl prattled pleasantly
in. the foreign tongue and were suitably re-
warded. John Madden, C.J., the old-
established butter merchant, handed round
neat sample pats, and several mammas
would have burst with pride if they had not
been securely hooked up the back.
The annual caper of Mrs. and daughter
Green’s dancing pupils was the usual stylish
triumph, among the noticeable effects of the
evening being the appreciative noises of a
National Government House party which
reconnoitred the proceedings from a special
pen. The dancing, which began soon after
seven and continued breathlessly _ until 11,
was a brilliant blend of the “dinky” and
the useful—ballroom hops and glides min-
gled with novelties and delightsome pas
seals. Probably Coral Whiteway registered
the hit of the entertainment. The young
damsel belongs to the Sinuous School of
Motion, and, indulging in a sort of Oriental
hip-wag as Cleopatra, left boyish admirers
panting to be her Antony. In “La Cham-
pagne” Miss Mollie Wall and Dave Devitt
gave away a surprising amount of informa-
tion about fancy dancing; and the small
Winnie Rossiter, four in age and 40 in con-
fidence, cleverly twirled her toes in “Fleur
de Soleil.” In “L’Oiseau de Feu” Nellie
Moloney was a small, animated vision; and
the “Imps” dance revealed Reggie Green’s
talent for eccentricity.
The Grey-Egertons have treked to India.
Before leaving the lady dispensed tea and
cake at Fairlie House. Her cousin, little
Miss Cumming, follows her, in charge of
the late Judge Chomley’s widow; but that
won’t be till March.
Willie Harper, who tried to drive his
motor through a cottage during the Fleming-
ton race week, is out of hospital and has
bought a new car. It used to be one of the
Denmans’ purple fleet. For a few days the
new owner ran the car about with the golden
crest glittering on the panel.
The rich Pearsons, of Kilmany Park, have
rounded up their growing family and started
out on a two years’ wander. The Frank
Maddens gave them a farewell dance the
night before the Osterley rolled them out
through the Heads. Son Roy. a good-luok-
ing boy of 19 or so, had been sent up to
Bananaland in order that he m_ght escape
the distractions of city life; but, in the end,
mamma collected him for the long jaunt.
Herbert Syme and his wife have bought
an entire island in the Gippsland Lakes. A
beautifully grassed and wooded scrap of
green solitude, it now supports a 17-roomed
palace, or bungalow, or bungapalace, with
steps on all sides for visiting motor-boats.
Inside it is mostly hardwood polished walls,
and floors strewn with rugs. Summer-
weight furniture has been going down in
waggonloads, and astonishing the natives.
Mr. Syme is even thinking about getting a
hydroplane, so that he may rush across the
placid face of the waters like a disturbed
waterfowl.
Mrs. Gunn, of “We of the Never-Never,”
is now travelling in England, and working
on another book which is to a sheltered
life-chronicle full of hedged fields and sheep-
trimmed downs—the antithesis of her Back-
block jottings.
Hugh Buckler and Mrs. Hugh (Violet
Paget on the bills) have been feted furiously
by Toorak since the discovery was made
that Mr. Buckler’s papa was a viceregal
personage, and his wife a member ofV*he
Anglesea family, which contains a Marquis,
my dear.
The Chester Manifold chick Marian, who
has been on a visit to England, has returned
to the family mansion in the Western Dis-
trict. She blushfully displays a diamond
ring, slipped over the third finger of her
left hand by a P. and O. officer.
Una Bourne, the fair-haired pianist, has
departed for the Cold Country, in search of
fresh chords and masters new. Laurie
Abrahams, the liberal purchaser of horne-
grbwn works of art, has also left for the
Hub, accompanied by ’cellist Louis Hatten-
hach, who hopes to find a market in the
Fog for some melody of his own manufac-
ture.
John Amadio, Melbourne’s sweet flautist,
has become engaged to Consul Gunderson’s
daughter Sara; thus adding further to the
discredit of the Notorious Mrs. Rumor, who
knew—“on the best authority, my dear”—
that the lady in the case was a certain
earnest damsel with a yearning, for Art.
Veronica Bedford, the 18-year-old daugh-
ter of Randolph, shines at Marshall Hall’s
Conservatorium. Mrs. Weiderman predicts
a great future for her as a contralto, and,
meantime, the indefatigable girl puts in 16
hours a day plucking harmony and counter-
point and other wild annuals of the pleasant
art. A beautiful little madrigal of Miss Bed-
ford’s composition was charmingly sung at
the Conservatorium concert at Melbourne
Town Hall the other night.
Jack Baragwanath, whose father is
Mayor of South Melbourne, has induced
Miss Dakin, the beauty girl of the Valaze
people, to murmur “Yes.” The young man
is a smart dresser whose clothes enrich the
Block. There was a deluge of congratula-
tions at the recent South Melbourne may-
oral reception, where a thousand people
struggled for refreshments in the approved
fashionable manner.
A childless dame in the Very Best circles,
who worked hard to get cash for the Babies’
Home, was lately invited to take one of a
choice bouquet of chubby foundlings. They
were so dimpled and adorable that hubby
felt certain she would take at least one, and
started to think out a pension scheme for
the lady’s pet dogs. The matter was still
in the balance when the management of the
fashionable flat where they shelter weighed
down the scale with an intimation that they
would not be tolerated as tenants if they so
far forgot themselves as to acquire an En-
cumbrance. So the ownerless babies remain
in the Home, and the pet dog’s lease of the
cushions has been renewed indefinitely.
Unless Heaven intervenes, there will be
a large Easter bazaar in the Exhibition in
aid of the Women’s and Homoeopathic Hos-
pitals. The new city Mayoress is working
up a Melbourne stall, and Mrs. Baragwan-
ath, Mayoress of South Melbourne, is lead-
ing her devoted suburbans into the razzle.
Some theatrical stars swept out of their
orbits to help the Sisters of Mercy with an
al fresco entertainment in the tropical gar-
den of the Oriental Hotel on Saturday after-
noon. Sybil Arundale danced and Talleur
Andrews spoke a piece; Hugh Buckler,
beautifully tailored, and Violet Paget, his
fashion-plate wife, also contributed a turn.
Dorothy Brunton, Violet Collinson, Percy
and Sherras were other stage people who
lent a hand. Tenor Kirby, farewelled, but
not yet departed, lifted up his silver voice
in the good cause; and pretty chorus girls
sold tea and light refreshments on the sunlit
lawn. The cause is expected to benefit by a
tankard or so of cash.
On a recent afternoon, the time-defying
Austral Salon gave concert room to harpist
Barker and violinist Gertrude Summerhayes.
The programme was a dainty slip all sky-
blue and gold, which burst into quotation
like a delicately-tinted rocket: “David took
an harp and played with his hand : so Saul
was refreshed and was well.” The audience
took the poetical hint and murmured rap-
turously directly the rippling music ceased.
Miss Violet Loraine, our latest consign-
ment of principal boy, recently arrived by an
English mail boat. The beauteous stranger,
who is to dance and warble in “Puss in
Boots,” has been much in evidence, accom-
panied by a mamma who chaperones her dar-
ling with eclat and a gliding tread. Miss
Loraine was noticed in a box at the Theatre
Royal the other night, and a glass turned
upon her place of concealment revealed a
glacier expanse of neck, a diamond star, a
pair of blue eyes, and a quantity of bright
blonde thatch.
Luna Park has added another distraction
to the sea front of St. Kilda. The gateway
is a huge, silver moon-face, which swallows
the crowd in large gulps and roll- delighted
electric eyes. Girls sit in Roman chariots
outside the countenance, and sell tickets to
those who want to push through the turn-
stiles, which clatter like metallic teeth. The .
mile-long switchback railway is the principal
joy. A white bandstand, crammed full of
scarlet brass blowers, is one of the most
noticeable and deafening features of the
show. “The River Caves of the World” is
fearfully popular with the sentimentalists.
It is a covered gutter, which offers, for quite
a negligible sum, a limited amount of quiet,
darkness and seclusion. The queue waiting
outside this attraction demonstrated how
easily money may be made by getting a
crowd together, and then offering the lovers
a way of escape for a few brief moments.
Before the public opening, J. D. Williams
collected the Gaud Mayor, the local Mayor.
Josiah Thomas and other people, and took
them upstairs to dine and speechify on the
terrace which overlooks the bay. The real
moon generously shed its light* on the pro-
ceedings, and spilt its surplus silver on the
lapping sea beyond.
The Newman Society of Victoria had a
brain-stormy party in the Cathedral Hall.
Eastern Hill, last week. Carefully distilled
music was sandwiched in at intervals. The
society has no : member without some intel-
lectual feather, and the clash of contending
minds was like the clatter of a night-gang
mending a tram-line
After the death of her actor-husband, Mrs.
Frank Lincoln put her fair shoulder to the
wheel of the estate agency run by Mrs.
Stewart Anderson, while the boss wandered
off to calm her overworked self by gazing <
the soothing slowness of old China. Mrs.
Anderson has now come back to Melbourne
a refreshed. woman, and made the discovery
that the little widow Lincoln cannot be
spared. So she has been added to the firm.
Doris Cumming and Judge Chomley’s
widow leave early in March for the Riviera,
where they are to join the Grey-Egertons.
. Fashionable women are hard put to it to
circumvent the men-made laws regarding
ospreys and other adornments. The sweet
barbarians have discovered that a crane
that haunts Lake Charm grows the beauti-
ful feathers, and various people are under-
stood to be thinking out a way of getting
the unfortunate bird’s crest without collid-
ing with the law.
“Rosna’s” line or two from London:—
When young Edward of Wales finishes his brief
stay at Oxford probably next year—he is to be sent
off on a tour of the world ; and r according to present
intentions, will include Australia in his travels. He’s
a handsome and very solemn youngster, who looks as
though he already had the cares of 40 kingdoms on
his shoulders.
„ Qrainger has been giving a party in honor
oi Madame Grieg, widow of the composer who took
such a kindly interest in yellow-haired pianist Percy.
Percy himself couldn’t be there, because he was busy
playing pretty tunes to Holland and Germany, and
getting more laurels hung upon him.
The Australian trophy at this year’s Lord Mayor’s
Show made the rest of that ancient procession look
cheap. It was a trolly draped with Australian flags
and drawn by six fine Australian horses, one for each
State, with the State’s flag waving (more or less)
on its rump. Fruit and wheat sheaves were festooned
about the equipage. A red-shirted bush-gentleman
drove the show, with a stuffed kangaroo and emu to
assist him. And a magpie defied the world from a
shield that announced to gaping London—“ Australia,
the Land of Sunshine and Success.”
The Sydney fiddler boy, Godfrey Ludlow, had an-
other concert on November 14. His patronage list
began with Mary Queen of England, included the
Royalties of Greece and Austria, and finished
with mere dukes and agents-general. The lad is be-
coming quite familiar with the Royalties of Europe—
has played before the Queen, not to mention the
Sultan of Turkey and strings of arch-dukes and Im-
perial Highnesses. The concert drew a good and
kindly house, and the fiddler had some good and
kindly press notiecs.
From my Adelaide correspondent:—
Mr. Samuel Braund, who died at Prospect a few
days back, arrived in South Aus. in ’54. He started
farming in Hindmarsh, where the smells, smoke and
factories now are. After 12 years of pioneering he
was able to let his land and settle down in Adelaide
and affluence. He was 86 when he died, and he re-
mained a brisk, cheery youth to the end. His eldest
son married a daughter of R. Barr Smith, and is now
in England.
The death of Mrs. Boucaut, the wife of S. Aus-
tralia’s great and vigorous ex-Premier and ex-Judge,
came as something of a shock. But what death
doesn’t? She was the eldest daughter of that A.
McCulloch who made money out of sheep at the
Princess Royal station, near Kooringa.
A big squatting circle also mourns} the death of
Mrs. J. F. Cudmore, whose husband died only a few
months back.
The A. E. Martins have sold their station in the
Far North, and are advancing by forced marches on
Civilisation.
St. Peters won the shield at the cricket match.
Proceedings were more restful than usual. There
were no fights, or if there were I missed them. Any-
how, no dead bodies, or even wounded small boys,
were borne off the field. The barracking died of
something that looked like senile decay on Wednesday.
Evidently youthful enthusiasm cannot stand a four
days’ strain.
I have several weddings and engagements to record.
(How, my dear, would we fill up these screeds of ours
were Cupid to suddenly relinquish business?) Miss
Jervois, she whose people recently vacated their
station at Wellington, has presented herself to Mr.
Newland (a step-nephew of “Paving the Way” New-
land), while Miss Langhorne has yielded to the im-
portunities of Mr. Windser. I hope I haven’t mixed
the pairs up, but if so the thing has been done in
good faith. Mr. Windser is mostly on the land, near
Blackwood.
Mayor Bonython was married to Miss Warren on
Wednesday, at St. John’s Church, Halifax-street. The
bridesmaids were Miss Kathleen Warren and Miss
Schomburg, and Mr. Frank Moulden interpreted the
rSle of Best Man like a Master. Downers and Bony-
thons were there in force, and the presents were gor-
geous. I will not disclose the movements of the
newly-weds further than to say they have gone east.
On the previous day Mrs. Edwin Crozier was married
at St. Peter’s College chapel to Mr. Way Campbell.
It was a “quiet” wedding; that is to say, brass
bands, cannon, feu-de-.ioies, steam sirens, hooters
and non-relatives were barred. After the ceremony
the company foregathered (still with a total absence
of uproariousness) at East Terrace, the residence of
Mrs. C. T. Hargrave, the bride’s sister. The bride
wore a frock of soft grey and a be-plumed hat, and
was given away, more or less, by her sister, Mrs.
Julian Ayers.
Mrs. H. P. Gill has returned from England. She
went straight to Sydney in order to be present at the
marriage of her son, Lance, to Miss Moore.
Mr. Langley and his daughter are back from
foreign parts. Miss May Beresford, who has been in
Maoriland for the last year or so, is here for three
months. She is staying with her sister, Mrs. A.
McCulloch. On the other hand, Mrs. John Bagot has
gone, and a Fog-bound mail-ship is the richer.
The burglars, those sturdy individualists whom we
have always with us, made a foolish error last week.
Actually they were ill-judged enough to rob lawyer
Angas Parson and his father-in-law, S’Langdon Bony-
thon. Of course, the ’Tiser has gone well-nigh de-
mented over the infamy, and it is throwing ink at
the police SO copiously as to render them almost un-
recognisable. If within the next few years a genuine
burglar is really apprehended, the craft may safely put
it down to the fact that the Law was stirred to a
condition of unnatural energy and perception by the
mad conduct or frolic of these reckless ones. Mem.
for burglars: Never rob a newspaper man.
The T niversity students made public asses of them-
selves this week, as is their annual custom. Most of
their symbolic wit and satire was directed at the
practice of mixed bathing. And yet it endures, as
witness the shocking state of Glenelg and Henley
beaches on anv hot afternoon.
Died at Millicent on Wednesday, S. J. Stuckev,
who was born at Glenelg in March of ’37, and used to
claim to be the first native-born South Australian.
Every time he did so all the other old men in the
room used to infuriatedly dash their hats on the bar
counter, and sav, in effect, that he was a shameless
er—Liberal. The few who didn’t claim the honor
for themselves mostly nominated one W. J. Black,
who was born in February of the same year, and died
in 46. Mr. Stuckey’s lamented decease will mean
the loss of much enjoyable controversy.
Miss E. D. Proud, the first winner of the Spence
scholarship, has left for M.L., where she intends to
study social and industrial problems. It sounds
festive—but one never knows. And, anvhow, I under-
stand that there are very few public ’ houses in the
I O U islets nowadays.
_ A gentle Indian hawker cut his horse’s tongue out
the other day, and was nuite overcome when the Law
seized him by the scmff of his discolored neck and
ran him in. The Bench at Jamestown sent him on to
cr£ Criminal Sessions. Which proves that the
o.P.G.A. is sometimes of more value than an Empire
League or two, after all.
Sincerely yours.
JOHANNA.

POLITICAL
POINTS
THE INTRUDER.
We are told that a third party is required to rid
the country of machine politics....The evil that it
might do is manifest; no one has yet shown in what
way any good might outcome from it. —Party Press.
Being the story oƒ some undelivered goods, and
another boy locking for a job.
The Bill for electrifying the Adelaide-to-
Glenelg suburban railway has been almost
contemptuously thrown out by S. Aus. Par-
liament. The Tramways Trust desired it,
and so did the Railways Commissioner, but
members who want things done for them-
selves couldn’t stand the idea of spending
£40,000 on altering a system which works
pretty well. The chief trouble is that for
the last 600 yards the trains run up King
William-street. It is a quiet semi-suburban
road, two chains wide, and one party says a
slow train is no worse in it than a fast
tram, while the other says that any sort of
train in a street is a laughing-stock and a
relic of barbarism. It is now proposed to
stop the train outside the city, in which case
the trams will have to take the people on;
but if that scheme is persisted in the little
seaside town, and all the townshins in be-
tween, will probably rise in a terrible rebel-
lion.
Verran, in the S. Aus. Assembly, moved to
reduce the State’s Immigration vote by
£5OOO, avowedly with a view to handing over
the business to the Commonwealth. The
motion was not very strongly pressed, and
was lost—l 9 to 13. The discussion pro-
duced one neat retort. Soutliwood : “Do you
think all these newcomers will continue to
be farm laborers?” Lands Minister Young:
“No. We expect them to become farmers.”
Trenwith, one-time Laborite, one-time
Liberal Minister, one-time top of the Vic-
torian Senate poll, a man who if he had
held politically straight would probably have
been Australia’s Prime Minister by now,
has been selected by the “Liberal” ladies
and leagues of Hobart to contest Denison
against Laborite Laird Smith at the next
Federal elections. After being dropped
decisively from the National Parliament,
“Trenny” looked round for another job,
and picked out McLachlan’s Gippsland State
constituency as an easy battle-ground. But
the eccentric McLachlan walloped him, and
now he moves along to Tasmania for an-
other Waterloo.
“Larrakeeyali” from the North : —-
Dr. Gilruth announces that lie expects to have 50
farms on the Daly River (N.T.) open for selection
by Christmas. A few months ago the figures stood
ait about 100. But consider the futility of it all.
Australia wishes to see a thriving agricultural popula-
tion along the valleys of the Daly, Victoria, Roper
and Adelaide 1 Rivers. But if these localities were as
the Garden of Eden for fertility, they would be use-
less to settlers under present conditions. There is
practically no local market,', and the means of trans-
port are much the same as in the days when Jacob
imported corn from Egypt. In addition to these han-
dicaps, the cost of labor will be every penny of 13s.
4d. per day. Obviously the first duty of the Govern-
ment, pending the extension of the railways, should
be the creation of a local market for produce. The
Territory looks to the mining industry to create that
market. Mining is the country’s first and supreme
hope industrially, agriculture being helpless without
such a leg-up. Yet, after nearly two years, the
mining ordinance still hangs fire, and while £20,000
per annum is . voted to demonstrate what can be
grown' by settlers who will never come till they see
a market on the horizon, mining—the first industry
in the country—is expected to prepare the way with
a vote of £11,750, of which £lOOO goes to Arl-
tunga and £7OO for incidentals. The old pauper
system of help to prospectors ife to be persisted in,
while the case calls for regularly paid, organised and
disciplined parties of experienced men. The latter
would, however, be a Socialistic idea, and there
seems to be nothing Thomas, the Minister in charge,
so much fears as Socialism. In the development of
the N.T. the Government must make its choice be-
tween two alternatives—cheap alien labor and cheap
development on the one hand, or white labor and
costly development on the other. Australia is pre-
pared to pay the price, but Fisher and party are
trying to get a white North cheaply, shirking the
Transcontinental railway and mining development, and'
vainly hoping for farmers in a country remote from
markets. Every man in the Territory recognises
that development here will, and must be, costly, but
what all gird at is the waste of money on futilities.
When the motion authorising the electrifi-
cation of suburban railways came finally
before the Vic. Assembly, Premier
Watt intimated that defeat meant
the advent of Opposition-leader
Prendergast and his hopeless
minority, with the certainty of a
consequent dissolution. Neverthe-
less, when Prendergast moved that
no tender be invited or accepted
for traction without Parliamentary
sanction, Watt forgot all about re-
signing—he just caved in, , and the
resolution was carried by 3S votes
to five. The five comprised coun-
try Laborites McLachlan, McGrath,
and Plain, Tory McCutcheon and
lawyer Mackey, member for the
district where the Morwell shindy-
kit lias its home. The seven who
paired “against” consisted of the
more reactionary country M’s.L.A.
The House of "Fat has now to have
its say ; and. though it would like
its friend Private Enterprise to
have a finger in the pie, it will
doubtless conclude that a bite off
someone else’s bun is better than
no loaf at all.
Nielsen, who, a year ago, threw up his
Lands portfolio in the N.S.W. Ministry, and
was scandalously given some sort of a for-
eign mission with £4 a day for “expenses,”
will very likely not return. His troubles are
not wholly political. McGowen is alleged
not to have known what was the matter till
the other day, whereupon that confirmed
Sunday-school superintendent became very
angry. Probably that accounts for the
Government’s sudden demand to know of
Nielsen when he proposes to end the £4-a-
day mission and come back to his Parlia-
mentary job.
Wood, the ' Acting leader of the N.S.W.
Opposition,Ts out to put.a spoke in the wheel
of Beeby’s coach, by declaring that the ex-
Labor man is an arch-enemy of the “Liberal”
cause. It looks as though Wood scents an-
other possible claimant for the “Liberal”
leadership. After all the noise Wood has
made, and his fierce conflicts with Mr.
Speaker, it did look as if his grateful party
should hand him the laurel, or wet towel, or
whatever it may be that binds the brow of
Wade. But narties are ungrateful cattle.
Here is McLinen in the field, and —now,
possibly, Beeby! Naturally. Wood feels
hurt; but it is always open to him to go out
and form a seventh or eighth party—to be
known as (say) the Biffbashites.
The N. S. Wales agitation against the
“eviction” of the Governor-General is de-
veloping into a jest. This is apart from the
fact that any public movement in which
weird characters of the McLinen, McArthur
and Henley stamp take star parts is bound
to become steeped in broad farce. The
recent presentation of petitions “on the floor
of the House” from the “loyalists” of the
State was a particularly absurd feature of
the uproar. Twenty-three of the documents
were gravely brought forward by 14 different
members. It was quite impressive. Then
someone thought of counting the number of
protesting “loyalists.” Seven of the peti-
tions were found to contain less than 10 sig-
natures apiece, while three more carried
exactly 10 each. If these monuments of
bucolic idiocy are sent to London there
should be some hard smiling in that cheer-
less spot about Christmastide.
CONCERNING WARLIKE PREPARA-
TIONS.
It was terrible to contemplate that the Federal
Government had spent over £5,000,000 on defence,
involving the country in that mesh of military expen-
diture out of which the older nations had been for so
long striving to disentangle themselves.
—Recent Peace Society utterance.
SHORT-SIGHTED PARTY: “Now, there's a lesson
for you, young man. See how you poor
fellow-nation Is vainly endeavoring to
escape from that overwhelming"
THE OTHER P ARTY: “Rabbits! He isn't trying
to escape; he's only dragging the thing
into position.”
THE EXHUMATION.
Labor Ministers have opened the second Referendum
campaign. The Liberal press has called on the
various Liberal bodies to combine and formulate
another campaign in the manner so successful before.
—Recent news item.
The man hit hardest by the resignation
of George Beeby from the N.S.W. Ministry
and the Labor party is his own particular
friend, Attorney-General Ilolman. Holman
has had his heart set on London for quite a
long while. The first time he had his arrange-
ments in train, trouble arose with Dunn and
Horne, and his plans had to be changed.
Now when he makes final arrangements,
when his sister-in-law has been nicely settled
in a London billet, and his wife has blos-
somed as a London contributor to the Syd-
ney Daily Telegraph, and he has the whole
of the recess in which to find out how lie
likes the hub of empire, his bosom friend
smashes the project.
Seemingly those naicest women who nomi-
nally boss the Victorian Women’s National
League suffer from a plentiful lack of tact.
Recently, their secretary, Miss Grace Wat-
son, could stand it no longer and resigned;
now the chief organiser, Miss Eleanor Cam-
eron, follows suit, the alleged cause in her
case being the use of the word “union,” when
she might have equally well expressed her-
self by the word “co-operation,” “union”
being a common term mostly employed by
tradesmen and the—er—working classes.
Being asked to apologise for using the word,
Miss Cameron declined, so the committee
apologised to a sub-branch in her stead —
and that ended the contract.
Tasmania has chosen its official Liberal
and Labor candidates for the Senate. The
Liberals are Keating, Clemons and Bak-
hap ; the Laborites, Ogden, Dwyer Gray and
Hirst. Cameron, one
of the retiring Sena-
tors, refused to submit
his name for selec-
tion, and threatens to
run as an independ-
ent. Clemons is also
a retiring Senator.
Bakhap, a new aspir-
ant, is one of the
members of the State
House. He knows
something, about tin,
but nothing worth mentioning
about politics. Of the Labor
three Ogden is an old Mount
Lyell miner, by no means a
brilliant speaker, but hard-
headed and honest. Dwyer
Gray is a new-comer from Ire-
land, where he did good work
as journalist and platform
speaker for Home Rule. His
barracking for the Hobart
Labor daily no doubt helped
him to a rather lucky selection.
There are the makings of an orator in him.
Hirst is having a second try—he was just
defeated for Darwin at the last State elec-
tion.
From “10-2-4”
Blayney (N.S.W.), where ex-Minister and ex-
Laborite Beeby is to engage his old foe Withington,
in addition to an officially-selected Labor candidate,
is a queer sort"of constituency. At the behest of the
late AY. P. Crick it once partially disfranchised itself.
Crick instructed his supporters not to vote for anyone,
as a protest against the Labor party’s action in run-
ning Beeby against him shortly after the land scan-
dals. Beeby was beaten, because the men who might
have voted for him stayed away from the poll so
enthusiastically that in fairly populous centres, like
Duckmaloi and Irishman’s Corner, only two and
three votes were .regis-
tered. These places
were Crickite to a
man, woman and child,
also dog, and the re-
calcitrants who had
dared to vote were
treated a s traitors.
Blavriey has a way of
taking its member to
its heart —provided he
is a man of some per-
sonality. Crick con-
stantly announced in
the most public
fashion that he only
went on representing
the place because it
was a long way from
Sydney, wherefore h e
was rarely expected to
visit it and hardly
ever had to put up
with a visit from a
constituent. Once, in
the House, Norton
mentioned that he had
had a letter from one
of Crick’s supporters.
“It’s a lie,” said
Crick, cheerfully,
“None of my support-
ers can write.” On
another occasion li e
told a hushed Blaynev
audience that he would
presently tell the m
something which would,
cause them to shudder
in their socks—“those
of you, that is to say,”
he added, ' genially,
“who hanpen to wear
socks.” None of these
injurious remarks
alienated Blayney from
Crick in the least de-
gree. This habit o f
steadfast affection may
stand to Beeby; in-
deed, if it doesn’t, his
cake is mud. Nothing
but a powerful per-
sonal vote can save him.
DREAMS OF LIBERTY.
[FOR THE BULLEITN.]
In those days statesmen like Henry Parkes,
John Robertson, George Reid and others were in
harness. Greater ructions occurred in the House then
than now. Fourteen lion, members were put out by
the Scrgeant-at-Arms at one sitting. —Evening paper.
The clock had stopped, the trams had ceased to run ;
I guessed that it was past the midnight hour,
For silence had a little respite won,
And all the ghosts of other days had power.
The sleeping town was quiet as a cow,
Save for one cab that rattled down the street,
And one faint cat that made a distant row
On some far roof where feline lovers meet.
It was the solemn middle of the week ;
I dreamt of joyous hours now past and dead,
When pleasure had a thousand tongues to speak,
And gladness walked with roses round her head.
I did not muse of loves, romance or wine;
No pub obscured the landscape of my dream,
Nor parson murmuring of things divine,
Nor maiden deft absorbing frosted cream.
No memory of lucky times gone by,
Of Israel humbled for his parted odds,
Pursued my soul; no pleasant thought had I
Of gifts bestowed me by the wealthy gods.
I did not dwell on days when as a boy
My truant fancy saw the world at play,
But in my heart was recollected joy
No aftertaste of pain could steal away.
For I remembered in the splendid past.
When freedom burned with large and holy flame,
The bright aspersions politicians cast
Ere order woke or Henry Willis came.
Then stirred with righteous zeal the fearless breast,
Then with reverberations of glad sound
A member might be suitably addrest
As hog or traitor, liar, skunk or hound.
Dull is the daily round, the common task ;
The fretful parties spar for points in vain,
And only bitter memory wakes to ask,
When shall the muzzled push he free again?
y.s.w.

SPORTING
NOTIONS
The end of the sixth round of first-grade
cricket in Sydney on Saturday was, on the wholes
regarded as unsatisfactory. Of course, it is all.a
matter of point of view. The clubs which gained ad-
vantages, such as University, saw the finger of P
videnee in the wee wickets and horrible conditions
which made plav impossible, and saved the struggling
clubs from defeats. The finger gets strangely libelled
at times. North Sydney is still at the top, but as it
was unable to play out its match with Redfern, in
which it was a certain winner, it remains stationary.
University, by putting down Middle Harbor by 201
on the first innings, crept two points closer to the
arrogance of the top-dog', and supplanted Redfern for
the second place on the list. North Sydney has nine
competition points, University seven and Redfern six.
Waverley and Paddington have four and two re-
spectively; of the clubs below, feelings of common
humanity demand that no mention be made. Peter-
sham, having accumulated 176 to Paddington’s 140,
won by 36 on the first innings ; Sydney simply dazzled
itself by putting up 339 for the loss of five wickets
against Balmain, which in reply timidly tendered a
miserable 120, and left Sydney with 219 to the good
on the first innings. Gordon smacked 362 at the
first attempt off Central Cumberland, then put the
Parramatta team out for 160, and went home with
the balance to spare in its pocket. Waverley had a
moderately pleasant time with Glebe, scoring 271 to
198 in the first innings, and so winning by a margin
of 73. It was a bowlers’ day absolutely, and any
good scores that were made did not affect the results,
which were in every case decided by the first innings.
The first perfect Saturday for cricket
this season invited Melbourne batsmen to hefty deeds ;
but that steady, methodical bogger-in, Fahrenheit,
got nearer the century than most of them, stopping at
87° n.o. Carlton took strike against ’Wood, and had
laboriously compiled 199 when the relaxation was dis-
continued! East did somewhat better against Rich-
mond, arid had raked together 303 for nine wickets
when the scorer closed Iris book. Northcote. which
against P’ran had the best chance of a win it is likely
to get for a while, put together 202 for seven wickets
during three hours’ play. ’Varsity’s victorious
career threatened to end with a sudden jerk when St.
Hilda’s bowlers had captured seven wickets at a cost
of 60 runs, but the valiant Tlartkopf got into the
breach, pasted the Saintly bowlers, and left the total
at 232 when stumps were pulled. North collided with
the redoubtable ’Rov, and scraped together a paltry
173 on its own ground and a fast, true wicket. Cer-
tainly, these cricketers are earnest young animals,
and their efforts to amuse themselves by sprinting
about and perspiring in flannels, are more or less to
be commended ; but this writer reckons the better
part lay with those who loafed round the Bayside
camps in old duds, and lounged in and out of the
water, and flirted and fooled as the fit took them.
Marylebone Cricket Club mav be run by
earls and princes, but it’s as keen after the boodle
as any Jew dealer in Shoreditch. Warner’s last team
in Australia took back, among other things, a deficit
of £B3O and some odd silver and copper. The M.C.C.
is sending the Board of Control a bill for the last,
least ha’penny, and also asks for £lOO for all country
matches played in this continent. The Board will,
presumably, pay or compromise; but next time it
makes a contract with the M.C.C. it had better get
the document reviewed by somebody who has had ex-
perience in dealing with horse-copers.
The outcome of the “Imperial Cricket
Conference” puts the Triangular Tussle ihuswise.
England falls on the land of Kruger in 191.3-’l4, Aus-
tralia does likewise in 1914-’l5, and England swoops
on Australia in 1915-’l6. Australia calls on England
in 1916, and S’Africa in 1917. So Australia will not
see the Springboks for the next four years. It’s a
great game, cricket —a great amateur game !
* * * *
It is most regrettable that certain mem-
bers of the last Australian XI were not put through
a preliminary examination as to their knowledge of
how to bo decent although away from home. Most
of them were gentlemen; but as a very small pro-
portion were hooligans at heart, the whole team lias
to suffer in reputation for the doings of the scally-
wags. A - sub-committee has been appointed by the
Board to inquire into the matter and deal it out to
hogs who put both feet in the trough and squealed
while eating. The Board has announced that hence-
forth all players asked to make the trip shall be
medically examined—presumably as to their general
character and manners.
* * * *
E. E. Bean is the first delegate to be twice
elected to the chair of the Australian Board of
Cricket Control, and he is eminentlv fitted for the
job. He was for 20 years hon. sec. of North Melbourne
Club, and for the past eight years has been chairman
of the executive committee of the V.C.A. As a player
he had an average of 45 for 10 inter-State innings,
his highest score being 103 n.o. against Tasmania.
He was also for several years captain of the North
Melbourne Football Club, prior to t-be formation of
the League, and received hon. life membership of both
the North Melbourne cricket and football clubs. As
regards his fighting abilities, as shown in the battle
to establish the supremacy of the Board of Control —
well, one of these days when there’s a page to snare,
this paper will deliver its paean of praise. Nothing
but a paean, ai;d nothing but a page, will do the sub-
ject justice. Which probably explains why the great
dailies, all supporters of the M.C.C., refuse to publish
a word about his performances.

“Xox”: The one thing harder than getting
into the Queensland XI is getting out again after you
have been there a while. Colts bred on the premises
lose heart, enthusiasm, form and youth while waiting
on the threshold for the ancients to die or become
stricken with senile decay. And if bv chance an
ancient is dropped, he frequently, like Lazarus, rises
again. This year McLaren and Jennings were away ;
Polev Evans and Barney Cook were unavailable
(thank the Lord!), and a team had to be picked to
meet Ma without them. This was done, but still the
names of Rowe and Sheppard were not to be seen.
They did not even peep over the horizon. Then
Hayes became tired or angry, and threw in his lot
with the other unavailables, and Law filled the
breach. He and Oxenham later bolted to join Evans,
Cook and Hayes, and at last Rowe and Sheppard
crawled into the team. Sheppard banged 60-odd, not
out, and Rowe pasted 21, out of Queensland’s total
of 159. Then Rowe skittled the timbers of six of
Ma's batsmen for 15 runs, and Queensland had the
Old Lady thinking. She thought to some purpose,
however, and eventually galloped home, a winner by
eight lengths, or eight yards or eight drinks (I forget
which). Now McLaren has returned, and when the
trip to Sydney is poking its nose into our other busi-
ness, Evans and the rest of the unavailables will be
verv much in evidence. Who is to be pushed over
the brink into obscurity to leave room for Rowe and
Sheppard is a problem which will give the three
selectors an attack of brain fever.
* * * *
The Six Days bike race in N’York is
generally a strenuous affair, and this year’s is said
to be tougher than usual. Falls have been frequent,
no less than a dozen occurring in a day. Grenda,
the big Tasmanian cyclist, was last week accused of
foul riding, and the hostile portion of the audience
proceeded to deal out punishment without waiting
for a trial, bombarding the Australian with ginger-
beer bottles. Fortunately none of them hit him. A
ginger-beer bottle isn’t a nice bouquet to throw at
a man; still, perhaps it was kinder of the Yankees
to try to hit Grenda with the hide of the thing than
to make him drink the contents.
Some time ago the English crack cyclist,
Leon Meredith, set up a new 100 miles out-and-home
unpace'd world’s record by slithering over the dis-
tance in 4hr. 52min. 5.1 4-ssec. A prize of £2O
and a five-guinea gold medal was immediately offered
to the Australian who could go one better. Several
wheelers made an effort but failed, and then Vic-
toria’s mighty pedal-twirler, Don Kirkham, an-
nounced that he was on the war-track. He went
about his arrangements leisurely, and while he
leisured young Tasmanian F. T. Keefe rose up early
and did it, thereby annexing the cash and the bauble
—4hr. 50min. I7see. Kirkham immediately an-
nounced that he would lower the new record, and he
did it, in 4hr. 36min., finishing with a splendid
sprint in which he covered the last 12 miles in 36
minutes. Then, feeling good, he went forth and fell
on Harry James’s long-standing record of 61min. for
25 miles unpaced road ride. He smashed it badly,
reducing the figures to 50min. 304 see. This huge
reduction may have been assisted by the fact that he
had the benefit of a good following wind, which
James did not have in the long ago.

Motorists and motor-cyclists are expected
to ante up £20,000 towards the Victorian revenue
next year. Motor-bikes are hit with an annual regis :
tration fee of ss. each, while cars pay on an ascend-
ing grade: those not exceeding 64 h.p., 21s. each;
64 h.p. to 12 h.p., £2 25.; 12 h.p. to 16 h.p.,
three guineas; 16 to 26 hp., four guineas ; 26 h.p. to
33 ditto, £5 ss; and anything above 33 h.p., £6
6s. each. Motor lorries, waggons, etc., nay £3 3s.
There are 4683 motor-cars and 3127 motor bikes in
Victoria. It is regarded as heave taxation, but in a
wav the owners will get the money back, as the
£20,000 the tax is expected to yield is earmarked to
pay interest on the £40.0,000 which is to be spent annu-
ally bv the Board till the roads of Victoria are
properly restored. Re-created would be a better word
for some of them.
A one-armed boy lias just made some
dust in Yankeedom bv riding from New York to
’Frisco on a bike in 81 days. The" distance is .3875
miles, and the actual ridin«- time was 63 days—•
which is over 61 miles per day. Query: Was he
watched the whole way ?
J. A. Fair’s scamper from Sydney to
Melbourne in 29hr. 43min. has raised the question
whether it is possible to cover the 572 miles on
a motor-bike in the 24 hours. Harry B. James, who
knows the trip well, and has 'done it more often than
he cares to remember, is distinctly of the opinion
that it can be done, but only under most excellent
"management. Feeding arrangements must be fault-
less, for a man’s last ounce of strength will be re-
quired to stand the strain. Fair was nearly starved
on his run, otherwise it is certain he would have got
through in less time. Then, there is the matter of
railway gates, which are always locked during night
hours. Prompt opening of these would have to be
arranged for. Also, the 24in. tyre is not large
enough. One requires a motor-bike whose forks will
take another inch of tyre, and thereby avoid the
bumping and knocking about. Finally, the rider
should have company over the whole distance. But 1
it is doubtful if the empty honor of the achievement
is worth the trouble and the risk. To maintain 24 ,
miles an hour for 24 hours in pursuit of a name is.
a vain thing ; nevertheless, Newcastle rider Yee, who
held the record before Fair, is going out to try to
do it.
There is talk of another Inter-State Re-
liability Test for motor-cars between Sydney and Mel-
bourne, to be promoted by the automobile clubs of
the Ma State and Victoria in co-operation. Cer-
tainly, the time is ripe for another test, and if the
competitors were divided into two State teams the
excitement would reach boiling point. It would be
advisable to choose a new route, which would place
the old hands who took part in previous tests and
the new men on the same footing. For an all-round
test, , the South Coast route, as far as Nowra, then
across to Moss Vale through Kangaroo Valley, would
be hard to beat. It would test.’em, sure!

Beck soon lost his grip on the N.S.W.
half-mile amateur bike championship. Last week, at
Sydney, he met 18-year-old outsider Aubrey Taylor,
and when the dust cleared Taylor, had gathered the
medals and the glory, with Australasian champion
Burtinshaw chasing him hard.

As far as is known, no team of brothers
has ever competed in a six days bike race, but quite
a number of family concerns will be raging in the
Sydney fixture at the end of the month. P. J. and
R. Hird, F. D. and A. C. Walcott, and R. G. and
J. T. Honeyman will supply a world’s -record to the
Sydney race in this respect if no other, with three
sets of brothers out of a total of 19 teams.
Mr. Albert (who, when he is not yachting,
sells music for a crust), having presented the Prince
Alfred (Sydney) Club with a. new cup, to be won-three
times, eight yachts turned up on Saturday to get first
leg in. The wind came strongly from the south at the
start, but slowed down for drinks towards the end of
the game. The start, was a putrid one, only Thelma
getting away without loss of time. Aoma, the win-
ner, was 70sec. late in crossing the line. Then thev
streaked away for Bradley’s Head. Thelma had
hoisted a topsail at the very start, and before the
Head was reached Sayonara had let hers fly. Once
outside, things began to happen. Magic’s ballooner
fell overboard; Thelma’s extra was rendered useless
by the clew carrying away; and some other boat’s
iib got tangled round the sail or something, and
..there was much cursing. Aoma led back through the
Heads and got a clean break on the squadron. The
other yachts did wonderful things among themselves,
cutting one another out in marvellous fashion, but
none of them seriously threatened Aoma’s lead,
which offered the best practical demonstration of a
monopoly seen for a long while. When the handicaps
were worked out it was discovered that Aoma had
won with lmin. 59sec. to spare.

The N.S.W. Rowing Association’s regatta
on Saturday afternoon, on the Parramatta River, was
a decided success, in spite of adverse weather condi-
tions. It was feared that the water would be so
bumpy as to swamp the regatta; but it turned out
to be less hilly than expected. All the same, the
hummocks were quite enough, thank you. A mild
spasm of extra excitement was added by the presence
of four Olympians (Parker and Amess, of Balmain
club, and Middleton and Heritage, of Sydney club),
who were to be opposed to each other in the Cham-
pion Eights. This, of course, was the event of the
day, and provided a great race. Its chief feature
was the tremendous effort made by Leichhardt—a
featherweight crew, comparatively speaking—- who
struggled in a very respectable third, when, accord-
ing to all the rules of the game, they ought to have
been donkey-licked. Their lack of weight was in-
tensified by the rough water they struck for the
first three-quarters of a mile, which was when the
heavier teams got the fatal start. From the time
they entered smooth water the featherweights gained
steadily all the while; but the distance was too
short. Sydney went to the front at the start, with
Balmain a good second. The race quickly resolved
itself into a duel between these two, with Leich-
hardt always hovering near enough to make anything
possible. Balmain e-ot level with Sydney and then a
length to the good, but, struggle as it might, it
could not shake Sydney off any more. Then it was
conjectured that the astute Sydney boss was letting
Balmain make the pace, and intended to just hold
on till the time to strike arrived. But when the
time arrived Sydney couldn’t strike, and Balmain
came home a length and six feet to the good.
“The Pariah”: “D.” (B. 2S/U/T2) de-
rides the alleged payment of agents by Tatt.’s sweep
people. I may suggest that “D.” does not know
everything. Nor do I : but here are two things I do
know: (1) There are in Sydney at least two agents
who will procure tickets for ss. Bd. As these men
do their business through a bank, to make
a fair profit, and are not, in all probability, paid by
Tatt.’s. (2) I forward to one or another of three
agents in Tasmania, who probably are paid by Tatt.’s,
for I send only the bare ss. 2d. Each ticket costs me
ss. 74d., made up in this way: Ticket, ss. 2d., poundage
lid., postage 2d., two stamped and addressed en-
velopes 2d. I only make a saving of lid., but I have
the satisfaction of doing the business direct.
Hugh D. Mclntosh had a mighty narrow
squeak of being tied up with Johnson in a hard-and-
fast agreement when Johnson’s egg burst. The
Smellful One was working some point or another
with an Amurkan maanger. and wished to keep the
Mclntosh offer open, or dangling like a whip over
the other fellow’s head. To gain time he made im-
possible conditions regarding a deposit, and a big one
at that, with some person quite unknown to Mclntosh.
Then the egg broke, and when Johnson groped his
way out of the odor he found the Mclntosh offer had
made its escape. It would have been a predicament
for Mclntosh had the money been deposited before
the smell got loose.

John L. Sullivan, sometime mighty man
of ring war, has gone on the land near Boston,
Massachusetts, and cultivates beans, cucumbers and
prize spuds for consumption in the home of Ameri-
can culture. He declares his farm is the loveliest
spot on earth, and that the garish lights and gor-
geous sea-coast of Bohemia are not in it with that
farm. Quite apart from his farm, though, Jonel is
said to have quite enough “socked” away to keep
him in quiet comfort for the rest of his allotted
span. Another immortal who talks of retiring into
the shell of obscurity is Frank Gotch, the wrestler.
He declares that training is such a hideous process
to him that it harrows his innards and even the
thought of it melts his heart. He has won much glory
and made many fat purses at the deadliest of games;
but the horror of training outweighs everything—
absolutely everything. Gotch will probably retire to
a pub—called in the States a saloon, but a plain,
unvarnished, beer-reeking pub notwithstanding.
A few years ago there were 36 pugilistic
clubs in Greater New York. There is now only one,
“The Gentlemen’s,” where everybody is expected to
wear evening dress, and fancy prices are charged from
the outermost fringe to the best inside seats. So,
apparently, boxing is dying a natural death in the
Gomorrah of Eastern U.S.A. It isn’t that the
popular appetite for stoush has died out- —in fact, it
is generally admitted that the public are more in-
terested than ever. It was the exorbitant greed of the
bruisers themselves that killed the geese that laid
the golden eggs. The bruiser head had become
swollen, and he was unable to talk in anything but
thousands. The public had got accustomed to the
best, and would have nothing else. Prices sogred
up till they reached a point at which the fight-fan
shied and turned him away in great grief. The
Best were a very limited crew, and they demanded
prices which left the promoters and clubs nothing.
While they fought on percentages it was all right;
but the trouble was the Very Best demanded guar-
antees instead of percentages—and got them. Now
the guarantees have got the promoters; and the boxer,
as far as. N’Yuk is concerned, is out in the cold.
The same tendency has been noticeable in Aus-
tralia.

James Flynn, who made such an unhappy
showing against .Johnson in New Mexico, recently
got another paternal walloping from a' rising sprig
known as Luther Macart.v, at Los Angeles, the place
where the roses grow. Flynn now rises to explain that
the walloping was more or less undeserved, as after
the eighth round one of his seconds spilt a bottle of
ammonia in his face, so that when he rose to resume
he was blind as a bat and in great pain. And
during this interval Macarty seems to have improved
the shining three minutes for all he was worth.
Incidentallv, he improved the size of Flynn’s coun-
tenance. The latter demands another fight. May he
get it.

After the scrap at Sydney Stadium be-
tween Hock Kevs and Frenchman Poesy on Saturday
night, referee Scott called upon the judges to hand up
their verdict, and when they did so it was found that
the Gaul had it. It was an exciting battle. The
Australian was cool, skilful and dazzling in his de-
fence work; and had he the physical force of his
opponent to put behind his blows, a badly-battered
visitor would have been carried out of the ring be-
fore the battle had gone half the 20 rounds. Com-
pared with Kevs, the Frenchman knew nothing about
boxing. But he took all the punishment Keys could
ladle out —and it was ladled out right loyally—and
bored in to get home his rib-battering wallops. Keys
would have been reduced to pulp but for his magnifi-
cent defence. Yet Poesy could not knock him out. On
'the other hand, many of the blows Keys landed would
have scored a knock-out if Keys had had such a thing
about his armament. It is almost unfair to call upon
Keys to fight—a boxing match or a sparring contest
is the fair thing for him. But as it wasn’t a sparring
contest, it is hard to see how the judges could have
given any other verdict.
The fight that England was mad to see,
between Australian Mehegan and Englishman
); el . s b> is a thing of the past. It took place at the
National Sporting Club, and went the full 20 rounds.
At the end of the mill the referee intimated that
Mehegan was licked on points; and then Welsh went
down and collected the money, and Mehegan sat down
and knew what it is like to be beaten. It was his
first defeat in England.
The Ma capital sat up with a start last
week, when word went forth that the famous East
Sydney Swimming Club had decided to commit hari-
kari. Jt was not a matter of money, but a ease of
being unable to find young blood. The officials had
grown weary of combing the highways and by-ways
u er them in. It would not have been so bad
it 7u Cre een P lent y concealed among the hedges;
but there were not. And then the club’s heart
broke.
Barry, the Sydney swimmer, got loose
again on Saturday. It was a club 100 yards handi-
starting from scratch he streaked through'
the distance in 56 l-ssec., which chipped 3-ssec. off
Longworth s Australian record for the distance. But,
fast as it was, it was not fast enough for the oc
easion, and got him only second place in his heat.
Adelaide has just acquired a second water-
fall—or rather, the S. Aus. public has, J. Sv
Reid having presented the State with one
that tumbles into a gully on his Hills
property at Magill. The surrounding
scenery is, of course, included in the hand-
some gift. It is only in the last 20 years
that Reid has had any waterfalls to give
away. For years and years he was toiling
on country newspapers, mostly on new min-
ing fields, and at last found himself at
Silverton. The Barrier turned up trumps.
He made some money out of the Silver Age.
(long since defunct), and a lot more out of
the Broken Hdl Prop, and other mining
ventures. Then he plunged in Chillagoe (he
had spent some dry vears in North Queens-
land), and seems to have made money out
of even that disaster.
The president of the N.S.W. Arbitration
Court is henceforth to be “Mr. Justice,” the
same as a Judge of the Supreme Court; and
the salary is to go up to within £lOO of the
Puisne Judge’s £2OOO a year. Years ago
Frank Rogers, K.G., afterwards a District
Court Judge, insisted that the president of
the Land Appeal Court should have the
rank and dignity of a Supreme Court
Judge; but he didn’t have Judge Heydon’s'
luck. The Government sat down hard on
the claim, whereupon Rogers resigned.
The engineers have been puzzling their
brains again about the right gauge for Aus-
tralian State railways. They might have
spared themselves the labor, inasmuch as
they have already settled that the two
Commonwealth transcontinental lines shall
be 4ft. SJin., and sooner or later that deci-
sion must bind all Australia. When the
system to which they must finally grow is
completed, the Commonwealth lines will be
the national trunks, while the State systems
will merely be the branches to feed them.
Meantime the engineers have gone back to
their States for orders, as they must have-
done in any case, since the question is purely
one of money—whether Victoria and South
Aus., on the one hand, or N. S. Wales, on
the other, shall re-lay their lines. It is:
just about certain that the States will say
that trade doesn’t demand the big expendi-
ture, wherefore nothing will be done until
the Commonwealth takes the job in hand and
decides what is necessary in the interests of
public safety.

The South Aus. Government has one fine
point about it— —it is good Australian when
it comes to encouraging industry. Recently
the Wheat State decided that it would like
some light passenger trains; but instead of
sending to the Yankee, it wrote to Sydney
with a view to ascertaining if any of the
Australian engineering firms could supply
the goods. The Caldwell-Vale Motor Trac-
tion Co. faced the music and produced a 60-
passenger car, with two 70-h.p. reversible
petrol-driven motors. The chassis and
motors were constructed at Auburn (Syd-
ney) and shipped to Adelaide, where the
carriage has been built to the company’s
design. The Yankees were kept well in-
formed as to what was happening, and
promptly threatened a legal action for in-
fringement of patent. It was pointed out
that the Australian firm could not possibly
know anything about motor traction; and
that, anyhow, it Avas impossible to make
motor trains without infringing some Yankee
patent. The Australians requested the
Yankees to send along particulars of the
infringement, and added, coldly, that,
although they had searched all available re-
cords, they could find no trace of a rever-
sible Yankee motor. In fact, they were im-
pudent enough to hint that the reversible
internal explosion engine was their own par-
ticular invention. Since then the foreigner
has been strangely and unusually silent.

In Melbourne the Grocers’ Association has been
squealing about the practice of giving “Christmas
boxes” to customers. Of course, the practice is in-
defensible, but the only person to whom the sand and
sugar man owes a vote of thanks in connection with
the matter is himself, just as Bung only has himself
to thank for inaugurating the counter lunch, which
now causes him so much pain. The “Christmas box”
habit, like the tipping nuisance, should not exist in
a country where the workers receive a fair wage.
There is no reason whatever why the Government
postman, the municipal dustman and various other
; people should be presented with alms in December, in
recognition of services for which they are paid all
the year round. The practice is a rotten one, from
all points of view ; but perhaps the very worst thing
for which it is responsible is the sight of the White
Australian slavey ogling the vegetable heathen for
what she may be about to receive,- in the form of a
pot of preserved ginger.
The statement made at the Sydney Labor Council
by E. Bennetts, of the Cycle and Motor Cycle Em-
: ployees’ Union, that the public is being continually
victimised by the sale of tin for gold and silver,
seems serious- enough to call for strict, not to say
fierce, inquiry. A delegate from the Jewellers’ Union
also asserted that employers could in some cases pay
all wages from the profits of fraud, and it was further
alleged that the 18- and 22-carat and “solid silver”
marks are svstematicallv misused to deceive and
swindle purchasers. If there is one thing Australia
ought to be able to make better than another it is
the little trinket which Evangeline loves to wear
against her heart. All the materials are here to hand,
yelling at the top of their voices for a local market.
Employees in the jewellery trade have, however, been
dismissed in wholesale batches lately, allegedly on ac-
count of insufficient Protection; but if the things
stated at the Labor Council can be proved true, the
first and foremost protection should be afforded to
the trade by the police. With that end in view re-
cent purchasers of the dazzling brooch and the flash-
ing bangle might have their ornaments tested by some
reliable burglar in order that the boots of the law
mav be turned in the right direction.

“Splodger” : Re cost of living, harken back to the
roaring early ’9o’s. Returning from the coast to
Coolgardie, we found the head of the line at Reans
Soak. On the train, among others, were Julian
Thomas (“The Vagabond”), a photographer for the
Leader (Melb.), G. H. Kingswell (who came from
Newcastle to set the press going on the goldfields),
and one or two more —two coach-loads altogether.
Julian’s lot went right through; our lot, including
Kingswell, stayed the night at a wayside bag shanty.
Kingswell would insist on having a bath. You
should have seen his face when he got his bill next
morning—supper, 3s. ; bed, 3s. ; breakfast, 3s. i
bottle of whisky, 125.; bath, 3 55.: the lot 365.
That jaunt about finished “The Vagabond” ; he did
not live long after it. #
A year or so back when the Jap, in mad defiance
of Cobdenism, McLinenism, etc., was raising his
tariff wall, and topping it off with broken glass and
spikes, he noticed that foreign soap was pouring in
at a rate that he considered over the speed limit. A
blistering duty promptly stopped the rush, and just as
promptly a foreign co. (English) with a capital of
£150,000 established the first considerable soap fac-
tory in Japan. If it’s true that the Jap washes him-
self seven or eight (or is it 78?) times a day, there
should be fat dividends awaiting this co.
“E.A.E.”: I left a suit to be cleaned, and this is
the letter I received about it: —
Dear Sir,—l wrot you letter to T— but you give
me now undresses cept to Railßoad Station. I dres
the letter to Railroad station wich you tole me in
the letter to send the suit when you close the 7s.
but you dont in close the railroad for the sending of
it i tole vou would be 6d. to A— now you gorn
to Brisban it will be more an 6d. evervbodie always
send the pastajre or the railroad. I write for you to
send the sending of the clothing. No letter no
nothin, wher i send the sending, respeck. P-A. i
tole vou my prize is 7s. in the shop an thot staff you
get on the clothing wasbo hard to get of and one
spot was rooing the cloth I had 3 times so much
work whit that suit.
I haven’t received the suit yet, but I’m enclosing the
railroad on the off-chance.

Trouble threatened lately for the poor million-
aires etc., who consume caviare. Apparently the
poor millionaire has been getting more numerous or
cultivating a larger appetite; anyway, the sturgeon,
from which the stuff is made, has been disappearing
out of Russian waters, and the price has been J? o "™;
ing ahead. Consequently the Hamburg firm (Stuhrs)
that handles most of the European caviare crop, ,
had to find something else to put on the millionaire s
plate, and lceta caviare has been evolved. So the
milPonaire can still have his titbit without going
utterly broke. # *
“H.W.C.”: My plain, unclothed opinion of 'the
manner in which stock is handled on the N-S.W.
railwavs cannot be set down here, but I will for-
ward it to any address enclosed in a box free from
observation. Cattle and sheep are still loaded into
the sides of trucks instead of at the ends, and in
order to make them face the journey, are whaled and
jabbed with sticks and poles until their bruises are
as plentiful as Anti-Australian politicians. It is
the only way it can be done under a system which
would have 'raised ribald laughter in the age of the
stone axe. When the animals are lulled and chilled
and put on the English market, the results of the
train-gang’s handling are promptly manifest. 1
reckon stockbreeders lose in the aggregate per
annum enough money to construct a railway or two
for themselves. *
“Hamer” : There is at least one industry in Aus-
tralia which wants Protection but doesn’t dare to ask
f or it—-namely, the manufacture of moving pictures.
There are seven or eight firms at work. A request
for Protection would amount to asking for an in-
crease in price of the majority of the foreign films
purchased by their customers, the picture showmen.
So thev have to lie low and say nothing. Yet they
need Protection as badly as the next concern if
not worse. #
“Melb.”: The Vic. Licenses Reduction Board has
just closed 16 pubs north of Bourke-street and east
of Elizabeth-street. Compensation amounts to about
£740 per owner, and £2OO per licensee. Chairman
Barr mentioned that the rent of existing hotels in
parts where others have been knocked out has
trebled, which justifies the lucky escapees being
made to pay for the unlucky. The Board pointed
out a few swindles for the benefit of those who are
thinking of going in for the hotel business. Owners
had no qualms about letting hostelries on long leases
in districts where, on account of an over-supply of
these popular resorts, the extinguisher of the Board
was bound to be applied. Thus, strangers to the con-
ditions had been taken in and done for through
failing to stipulate for a rebate in case of closure.
The chairman stated that in one case a large sum
was paid for the lease of an hotel bearing a convic-
tion which made its doom certain. One motto for
intending publicans in Melbourne is: Put not youi
trust in agents ; they are in the same class as princes
and widows. #
“Pick”: The contract system, under which many
of the big shearing sheds in Australia are now
handled, is responsible for the speeding-up that will
gradually eliminate all but the fast shearers, "he
'“'ntractor tenders to get through with the wool har-
vest at so much per jumbuck; and because a long
shearing means increased weekly wages and tucker
bill, he has no time for slow men. Also, he has no
time for wet weather, which would delay operations,
and his daily pravers against rain are the cause of
much drought in the land. At Currandooley (N.S.W.)
shed, this season, a contract gang of 16 ringers, who
had shorn shed after shed all the way through from
Queensland, made things hum. On one day their
slowest man knocked the coats off 198, and the fastest
chopped it off 253. Throughout the shearing, which
lasted the shortest time- on record for the station,
they averaged over 200 per man per day.
A Napier (M.L.) firm recently advertised for a
junior clerk (male), salary 10s. per week. When the
applications came to hand the firm was staggered to
receive a ribald reply from a caitiff who signed
himself Smith Jones. Wrote the ruffian: “Seeing your
advertisement for a JUNIOR MALE CLERK, at a
salary of 10s. per week, with previous experience
of ari Insurance Office, I beg to hereby present mvself
as a candidate for the vacancy. Before going further,
however, I should like to explain that, should you
decide to offer me the position. I should not feel
justified, in accepting more than ss. per week for the
first six years, until I had become accustomed to the
routine of your office. Although I am only 56 years
of age, I am almost a married man and have a large
famil'% who, unfortunately, inadequately support me
—so I hope my youth will not be the cause of your
declining my services, for I seem to be growing older
and older every day.” The firm ! replied in kind,
but Smith Jones had' all the best of it; and, come to
think of it, a firm which offers 10s. per week for an
experienced clerk deserves to get the -nobby end of
the stick, and get it hard.
“Kohu”: According to W. G. Crane, of Sydney, who
has just been looking into the matter, there is little
hope of developing an export trade in Australian
marble. Blocks for cutting up would require to be at
least five tons in weight, and freights would be pro-
hibitive. And the men. employed at the famous
Carrara quarries are paid only 3s. per . dav. But
why always this fearful anxiety to ship off this
country’s raw material —especially when the raw
material is limited? What’s wrong with developing
the Australian marble industry for Australian uses?
AVe may not be able to compete with Carrara, but
there seems no very good reason why Carrara should
be allowed to beat us on our own ground. Australia
has any amount of the best marble, as well as other
ornamental building stones, and Australia’s own
wants should, under a proper Protective tariff, be
sufficient to develop a big industry. No doubt the
average landlord prefers bricks, until municipal ar-
rangements become elastic enough to allow him to
use bark or hessian ; but luckily there are people who,
building for their own uses, want the best that is to
be had.
* * * *
“Horsefeathers” : Re the tangle resulting from the
High Court decision in the Toorak adverse-possession
case (B. 10/10/’l2), there is the chance of another
law suit, unless the bank sells the strip to Craine.
Craine can’t get in, or, if in, can't get out. He may,
therefore, claim that he is in the same position as
a farmer who purchases a piece of land in the centre
of another man’s block. That farmer would have
what is called a right-of-way of necessity. The
pending wrangle is as to whether Craine is in the
same category as a purchaser. If he gets the right
advice he’ll strip for the fray—or be stripped in it.
“Platman”: Some three years ago a settler in a
North Queensland district, hearing of fine returns
got from tobacco, planted a small area. In due
course he garnered his harvest, a small one, and sent
it to mark.et. The leaf realised Is. per lb., which
he considered a fair price; but accompanying the
remittance was a letter advising him to give up
tobacco-growing, as the Bowen district could supply
all the cigar leaf that was required for Australian
consumption, and intimating that if he persisted in
his endeavor to grow leaf, he need not look for the
writer’s particular company to be a buyer. To use
the mildest of terms, the letter was upsetting; and
the recipient sent it to the local press, and it was
duly published for the discouragement of the others.
The tenor of the letter was so diametrically opposed
to the policy of the Queensland Government, which
employs an’ expert, who advises agriculturists to
devote portion of their time and land to tobacco,
that the present writer was moved to investigate the
matter. Although recognising that imports were
taking the tariff wall in their stride, so to speak, he
opined that the 3s. 6d. and Is. 6d. duty on manu-
factured and unmanufactured tobacco, with a bonus
of 2d. per lb. on approved locally-grown leaf, was
sufficient to give the Australian farmer a show.
But he evidently opined wrong. In the Common-
wealth Year Book for 1911, there are some figures
dealing with the industry which take a good deal
of chewing. »The statistician shows that in 1888-9,
when the population was much smaller than it is
now, there were 6641 acres under tobacco in Aus-
tralia • in 1909-10 the total area was 2080 acres, or
less than a third of wlmt'.it was 23 years ago, though
now we have 25 per cent, more people. A hasty
thinker would perhaps conclude from these figures
that the work of social reformers had borne fruit,
that the homely pipe, the fragrant cigar and
the deadly cigarette had been cast aside, and that
Young Australia was growing up into the perfect
being. Such a conclusion would be utterly and hope-
lessly wrong. The consumption has been steadily
increasing, the importation and value of leaf has
been steadily increasing, and local production of leaf
has been persistently declining. In 1896 there were in
N.S.W. alone eight factories employing 641 persons.
The production was: Tobacco, 1,857,6161 b.: cigars,
16 5531 b ; cigarettes, 169,5201 b. ; total, 2,643,6891 b.
Of’ that total, 1,349,7761 b. were Australian leaf, the
balance of 693,9131 b. being imported. In 1910, for
the whole of the Commonwealth, out of a total of
10,951,0001 b. of leaf manufactured, only 1,399,0001 b.
were Australian grown. It looks as though some in-
fluence is at work to wet-blanket tobacco-growmg in
Australia. A suspicious person might jump to the
conclusion that a Trust was at work ; but in view
of the High Court’s opinion that Trusts are
characterised by ’’laudable intentions,” that cannot
be the reason. The Queensland Government might
very properly put the official figures before the
State’s tobacco expert, and ask him to report what
is the matter. I want to see the fly in the ointment
before I risk my own million (or less) in the busi-
ness.
OUNCE A TON.
[FOR THE BULLEITN.]
Hear the tale the stamps are telling, as they beat the
ore to sand;
’Tis the tale that tugs the heartstrings of the care-
less, roving band —
Of that band that haunts the rainbow, in a restless,
reckless race,
For the bag of gold that’s buried, so ’tis rumored,
at its base.
It will draw them like a magnet, whereso’er by Fate
they’re hurled,
For its “Ounce a ton or over! Oh, it’s ounce a ton
or over!”
Is the tale the stamps are telling to the world.
With the Austral sky above us, and the golden reef
below ;
And the old ten-header dancing at the best pace she
can go,
With a hundred drops a minute, hitting up a giddy
gait,
And the ridges of amalgam showing heavy on each
plate;
Can you wonder that it brings ’em overland and
oversea ;
For it’s “Ounce a ton or over ; oh, it’s ounce a ton
or over !”
Is the song the stamps are singing in their glee.
Then to Hell with recollections that are qualified to
vex,
The store will take our orders and the bank will cash
our cheques ;
There’s, plenty where it comes from, virgin gold from
virgin ground,
And we’ve all the world to play with, so let’s send
the metal round ;
Never fear a dull to-morrow ; all the world is blithe
and gay,
For it’s “Ounce a ton or over ; oh, it’s ounce a ton
or over!”
Is the hymn the stamps are roaring night and day.
VICTORIA.

SWEETHEART.
I’ve met sweet girls with different ways
And loving attractive figures,
There’s many girls with bright blue eyes
But few with the eyes of Mary.
She’s plain and she’s pretty
And attractive in her gait.
She’s a soul full of happiness
You can see it in her fac°.
Her home is just an ordinary one
A garden in the front
There’s creepers around the verandah
She loves the picturesque.-
At night I go to see her,
But gossip with her Dad
Her mother knows the secret
But fears to tell the Dad
And oft times when I’m lonely

I always think of Mary
Her laughing face that’s never sad.
.... A.N.: Spring trickles nleasantlv to the basket.
M. McD.: Verses unsuitable. Will consider prose
sketch. .. .J.M.8.: Looks like the average beginner’s
work. Musical, but has no particular claim to print.
... .R.C.: Your post-card poem will probably madden
all loyalists, but here it is:—
When the Crown Prince of Spain
Became intoxicated
And fell down a Royal drain
His mother was not elated.
It seems a mystery to me
And others who do guzzle
Why people such as he
Should guggle, guzzle, guzzle.
Throwing sixpences down the throat
Is an unseemly pleasure
Yet many do this deed and gloat
About it without measure.
Aiteca: Poor stuff of its kind, and you fo’-got
to attach your name and address. .. .AV.R. (Q.) :
Story needs oiling Myall: Feeble verse
Claude W.: Did you cut out that poem with your
little hatchet? Serva Jugum: Glad to hear.
First idea, or something like it, has, however, been
frequently put forward in the B. : the second is
already the law in N.S.W W. 8., Narromine:
Will try to help you if you can give approximate
date. . . .Clarence Fitz: No. 1 trouble about “Theatri-
cal Rhymes ” is that they don’t rhyme. For in-
stance, “Princess” wouldn’t match with “romance”
under anv circumstances. No. 2 trouble is that the
Rhymes wouldn’t be worth rhyming anyhow.

G. Ah Yes: No, they won’t gee, Ah Yes. Some
humor, but drawing impossible. .. .J.W.G.: The gag
is better than the drawing. And the gag is too much
like one that the late George Lauri exploited—“ Are
you singing or lodging a complaint?”... .Nat: You
want our opinion. Well, you’re a young lady, and a
candid one wouldn’t be polite, while a candied one
would do you no g00d.... Togo: Sorry to say we
can’t see any promise in it.... 11. C. Timaru: Some
distant hope in the drawings ; but the gags are im-
possible.


The Message of Sanatogen
No preparation of its kird has ever achieved such
a reputation as Sanatogen.
Many causes have contributed to this unpre-
cedented result.
Pre-eminent among them is the constant prescrip-
tion of Sanatogen by the medical profession which,
as a body, has awarded it the highest praise. More
than fifteen thousand doctors have written in the
most enthusiastic terms to describe the benefits they
have obtained from the use of the preparation
which The Medical Press and Circular states “has
strengthened the physician’s hand a hundred-fold.”
Everyone knows now that it gives
To the Sick —Health
It does this by its power of revitalising the
nervous, vascular, muscular, and digestive systems,
which it rapidly restores from a condition of depression
to one of normal action. By virtue of its composition
—pure milk casein in chemical combination with
organic phosphorus, an essential constituent of the
brain and nervous system —it feeds the brain and
nerves, it improves the condition of the blood, it helps
the stomach to digest other food, and it thereby develops
and strengthens the muscles. In this way it gives
To the Weak —Strength
and that delightful feeling of returning vitality which
tells the sufferer that he has conquered the disease
which had conquered him, and is once more on the
road to health, and the possibility of taking up his
life again where he had laid it down.
Sanatogen, however, does even more than this.
It has its message for those whom disease has not
touched. Everyone is capable of increased vitality and
vigour. By feeding the vital centres Sanatogen gives
To the Healthy—Vigour
so that work becomes a pleasure, toil becomes enjoy-
ment, and the whole system takes on a feeling of
•uoyawry, alertness and energy which is as delightful
as it is unusual.
Sanatogen’s merits have not only been eulogised
by the medical press, and by the medical
but have also been endorsed by hundreds of the best*
known men and women who have testified to the
cures it has wrought in their cases.
Sanatogen may be obtained from all chemists.

Odol does njore
than cleanse and beautify the
teeth; it preserves them from
decay,
Odol refreshes the whole mouth to the point
of exhilaration keeps the gums healthy and
free from tenderness, and delightfully perfumes
the breath.
And by a remarkable property, peculiar to
Odol alone, it permeates the lining membrane
of the entire oral cavity with its protective
antiseptic elements, leaving the mouth proof
for hours afterwards against the attacks of
injurious bacteria, which, if not guarded against,
inevitably destroy the teeth.
Odol is the most economical of all denti=
frices, for, owing to the concentrated
strength of the preparation and the
absolute purity of its ingredients, a few
drops only are sufficient for use at a time.

Throughout the long year Martell’s plays
its useful and pleasant part. When the need
arises for a powerful, medicinal spirit —the wise
use Martell’s. When friend meets friend, and Custom
and , Amity are honored —the warm-hearted use
Martell’s. When, at the close of a happy, convivial
meal, the liqueur is sipped —the refined use Martell’s.
When Christmas throws its mantle of festival over
all, this generous, time-honored spirit is particularly
appropriate.
For nearly two centuries Martelhs has stood
for all that is desirable and delectable in brandy.
Sun, Soil and Skill unite in producing that
triumph of brandy-distillation—MAßTELL’S.
KARTELLS
DRATNDY
“Platman”: It will, I’m sure, be a con-
solation to my distinguished fellow-country-
man, Mr. W. H. Kelly, M.H.R., to know
that, even in a remote mining camp of North
Queensland, where the shadow of the pon-
derous Age never falls, or the eye of the
inquisitive Argus never penetrates, liis
advt. “Misrepresentation corrected” (B.
28/11/T2) caused profound interest. It
may be also a satisfaction to him to learn
that the reading thereof stimulated in quite
a number a curiosity to consult Hansard.
There were six people at the same time in
our little backblocks School of Arts want-
ing the loan of the sacred volume. And
when we’d found it we discovered that the
terrible storm arose over a question of vast
national importance—just such a question
as Mr. Kelly would be sure to be an
authority upon; po more and no less in-
deed than over the reduction of the time
allowed lion, members to discuss their lun-
cheon. The shameless proposal was to cut
it down from 90 to 75 minutes. The shift
to which I have the honor to be platman
devoted portion of the 30 minutes allowed
us for crib (we are working miners, 'who
neither dine nor lunch, but merely eat) to
a discussion of the subject. On the motion
of Cousin Jack, of leading stope No. 1
level, it was decided to send our sympathy
to Mr. Kelly. In the words of the mover,
“Damme, boy, they Labor party no right
cuttin’ down men’s crib-time.” From which
our distinguished cobber—if he will permit
us to call him so —will see that one touch
of nature makes the whole world kin.
It is now fairly plain that the armed
camp of Europe is liable to be set going by
a goat falling over a kerosene tin in the
dark. A French brigadier at Nancy re-
cently got a telegram instructing him to
parade his men and have a look at them, or
do something equally unimportant. But:
the hurried man read it to mean that trouble
was at hand. Thereupon, having opened
his sealed instructions and spread out the
plans and specifications for the defence of
his section of France, he set things going.
Thousands of men were howled and hauled
out of bed; myriads of wives (and others)
wept to the jangling of church bells ; posters
calling all men between 25 and 45 to the
colors were dabbed with paste and slapped
on walls in the dark; and uniformed men
swarmed all over the place taking possession
of telegraph offices, railways, frontiers and
all the things worth having. The country-
side fairly boiled over for about five dark
hours. Then, with the cold light of morn-
ing, came the frosty news that the hurried
brigadier had made a mistake, and that
Germany had spent an excellent night un-
disturbed by the rumble of artillery wag-
gons. The brigadier was arrested on a
charge of nerves or jumps; weary reser-
vists plodded home cursing thankfully; the
posters were hosed off the walls; and the
wives and otherwise powdered their noses
and came down to breakfast wearing radi-
ant smiles. Still the joke wasn’t lost; it
served to show how ready “conscript”
France is. A nation, having its potential
enemy next door, can’t afford to muddle
along on the Australian kindergarten sys-
tem, or with the British territorial bur-
lesque.
thrope*^ 6 r ° m l )a l >er ’ s official misan-
outrages of the women maniacs who profess
to be striving for the franchise in England are tak-
™K h a new fo ™i. The idea of burning letters
with corrosive acids, and inflicting loss, inconveni-
ence, and possibly serious suffering on friend and
foe indiscriminately, seems to be about the high-
water mark of brutal incapacity to consider the
interests of others. I agree with Tennvson that
woman is not undeveloped man.” In some in-
stances she seems to be pretty highly developed devil.
‘■Joebusli” on a salty grievance:—
Another rotten decision was lately dished up by
a Marine Court and handed to an unfortunate skipper.
This time it was after an inquiry, held at Newcastle
(N.5.W.)., into the circumstances of a collision be-
tween an inter-State steamer and a sand-barge owned
by the Department of Works and controlled by the
Depaitment of Navigation. The collision took place
on June 11 last. A preliminary inquiry was held by
the Department of Navigation ‘a few davs after the
trouble, when the master and officers of the inter-
state steamer were required to give evidence. After
hearing this, the Department was able to buiid up a
pretty solid case, out of which the master had Buck-
ley’s chance of crawling with his certificate un-
marked. An inquiry was fixed for October 1. Then
something went wrong with a member of the Court
so the inquiry was postponed sine die. After a lapse
of nearly two months another one was opened on
November 21. This time the Court decided that the
skipper of the inter-Stater was guilty of reckless
navigation, and his ticket was suspended. The most
unjust part of the business—with the exception, of
course, of the decision—was the inordinate time that
was allowed to elapse between the occurrence and
the inquiry. Six months passed in this case. Many
of the skipper’s witnesses had meantime left the port,
and those that happened to be on hand had got their
memory so muddled that the prisoner might have been
better without them. A Court is just as liable to
make an error of judgment as the average skipper ;
but the Court never has its ticket hung up, though
probably five out of every six nautical men around
Newcastle would say that the decision in this case,
for one, was altogether wrong. At the best, the
master had a poor chance when up against two power-
ful departments at the same time; but what little he
did have was destroyed by the shocking delay in
dealing with the matter.
Under the new Commonwealth patents
law, patents agents and attorneys are in
future to be licensed only after examination.
The agents and attorneys at present in prac-
tice can, however, register without examina-
tion, and they also appoint two members of
the new board of examiners. There was a
heap of trouble over the election of these
members. The foolish law permits solici-
tors to register and vote even though they
never did a patents job in their lives and
never intend to. Three candidates were
nominated, and to get his particular man in
one agent whipped up 50 lawyers and regis-
tered them. That practically ended the
matter; W. J. Spruson, the Sydney nominee
of the Institute of Patents Attorneys, was
elected, but the Melbourne nominee was cast
out in favor of the man in whose interests
the 50 lawyers had been roped in. The
humor of the situation lies in the fact that
Fred Walsh, the Sydney agent who did the
roping-in on behalf of his office assistant,
says that the provision permitting lawyers
to be registered, whether they do patents
work or not, is rotten, aftd he took an effec-
tive way to prove it so. In these circum-
stances the law will probably be amended —
even though it is a good deal like turning
the key after the motor-car has been stolen

The Standard, Bananaland’s pioneer

consisted of 12 pages, and the indispensable
advts. ran to a too-brief 33 columns. It
proposes to offer its readers two meals a

the evening.
AN INCURABLE FULL STOP.
THE LITTLE O NE: “ Yes, you doctors may get
plenty of patients, but you don't get me. I
always doctor myself from medical books."
THE TALL ONE: “Yes, and one day you'll die
of a typographical error."
“Politicus”: Premier Denham demands
that the next conference of State Premiers
shall take place in Queensland. ' Queens-
land, of course, means Brisbane. Now, if
Denham could only contrive that these
southern statesmen should hold their cor-
roboree at Bowen. Atherton or the Evelyn
tableland he would do a real service to Aus-
tralia by educating the South on the poten-
tialities of the North.
“Boswell”: Certain Queensland politi-
cians moved out of their ruts during the
closing nights of the Session. Premier
Denham sneaked in a Bill guaranteeing 10
years’ tenure of office to the Commissioner
of Police, whose sacrosanctity must, it was
alleged, be maintained by Act of Parlia-
ment. Several Denhamites couldn’t swal-
low the pill and voted with the Opposition ;
and afterwards in Committee the 10 years
period was whittled down to five, even that
being only agreed to on the chairman’s
casting vote. The truckling of the Denham
Government could be discerned right through
the discreditable and unparalleled business.
The law can make any old thing a vegetable.
Thus the Eacham Shire Council the other day
proclaimed that henceforth Scotch thistles
and Scotch lice were to be noxious weeds.
By the way, and apropos of nothing whatever,
the Queensland Government a while back
declared St. Andrew’s Day to be a public
holiday, and the Brisbane public was so
enthusiastic over the concession that busi-
ness went on just as usual, and not a soli-
tary bagpipe skirled from one end of the
city to the other. St. Pat is the only saint
who gets a decent celebration in Banana-
land.
A Charters Towers (N.Q.) paper tells
how three local girls, out for a holiday,
missed the train to Macrossan, 10 miles
away, and set out to walk the distance.
They did it in three hours,, although the
temperature ran to 1201 deg. in the shade, and
drinks were unobtainable until the journey’s
end. Also, a Rockhampton journal narrates
how the Baptists of that town, having de-
cided to build a church', and lacking funds
to pay for labor, called together their young
men and erected a very decent sanctuary in
three hours. That damnable Northern cli-
mate again, sapping the energy of every-
body !
The attempt to give Police Commissioner
Cahill fixity of tenure for 10 years nearly
broke Premier Denham’s political neck. The
Labor party had threatened Cahill during
the Brisbane strike, and the Government
deemed it advisable to secure him, if possible,
against future danger of summary dis-
missal ; but the Denham following waxed
so mutinous that the Cabinet was glad to
compromise by cutting down the proposed
term to five years, and it only got that
through on the Chairman’s casting vote, and
after, it is said, a warm conversation among
Ministers themselves.
“Kuscobin”: The fact that only 47 stu-
dents were posted as nassing their exams, at
the Brisbane University out of 160-odd en-
trants is being held up against the authori-
ties, who are warned that the standard is
too high. The real explanation is that,
under the regulations, students may take a
number of subjects in one year and the re-
mainder in the next, but their names are
not published as passing until they complete
the full year’s list of subjects. A big pro-
portion of the undergrads, are night students
who extend the year’s course over two years.
The Uni. has done well to get a student
roll of 160 within two years of its birth;
its teaching staff is a particularly* good one ;
and to suggest, as is being freely done in
Brisbane, that students are ploughed for
the sake of the two guineas they have to
part up on re-examination in March is to
heave an undeserved and dirty brick at a
really good institution.
At last Toowoomba is to have its long-
delayed trams. Away back in the dust of
last century the local municipal council
gave an option to a syndicate to construct
trams. The affair traded on the option as
long as it could, and then went to sleep
until the council rummaged in! its pigeon-
holes and discovered that the time w r as ripe.
It then notified the syndicate and advised
it to get a move on. The surprised syndi-
cate hurriedly bought some new paper and
pens and signed a constructional agreement
a few days ago. Within six months there
should, consequently, be some sort of a tram
system in the old town; after which the
populace will slowly begin to feel the syn-
dicate’s heel and start to wonder, why it
was fool enough to let Private Enterprise
come in and squeeze an utterly unnecessary
profit out of what is essentially a public
service.
“A. Shark, K.C.”: Denham’s last Bill
was an Articled Clerks’ Protection Bill. It
arose thus. A certain Lethbridge was
articled to a Toowoomba solicitor. In the
agreement of indenture was a clause pre-
venting the clerk from ever practising in
Toowoomba. When 21 the clerk ratified the
affair, but later appealed to the Court tq
set it aside. After sundry barneyings the
Supreme Court held that it was valid.
Lethbridge appealed to the Full Court and
won. The respondent solicitor then took
his papers to the High Court, which allowed
the original judgment to stand. Denham’s
friends prevailed on him to bring in a Bill
to stop such one-sided articles; but after
feeling the pulse of the House and especially
of his six legal Cabinet colleagues, he with-
drew the proposal. So things are now as
they were before, and many similar vexa-
tious articles stand firm in the strength of
a High Court decision.
The Paradise of Fools.
[FOR THE BULLEITN.]
It lies a mile beyond us in the land of Go
it Blind ;
It waves a crimson banner with the motto
“Never Mind.”
Its folk they dawdle, dawdle in the sum-
mer’s ruddy glow,
And go around a-cadging when they feel the
winter snow;
Their fields are mostly weedy and their
crops are scant and small,
And why they’re not all millionaires they
can’t make out at all;
They run a braysome Parliament where
Jaw the Jackass rules,
And people call their settlement the Para-
dise of Fools.
They look upon the ploughshare as an in-
sult to the soil,
To strip the branch of fruitage is a grievous
kind of toil;
Bach house has got a leaning-post outside
the window-sill,
And ev’ry eve they hang thereon, and call
it “doing drill” ;
In case the land is overrun by brutal foreign
foes
They’d bid ’em collar all they could, but
, leave ’em in repose.
They have no time for armaments, for battle-
ships and schools.
Oh ! Life’s a loony picnic in the Paradise
of Fools !
They’re always on the borrow and they’re
seldom on the pay;
They’re feeble in the brain-pan, but they’re
mighty on the bray;
They feel, each one, this Universe is cen-
tred in himself.
They know that they are Porcelain while
you are common Delf;
They muddle down a lazy lane of foetid slime
and sludge,
Despising him who labors as a spineless
sort of drudge;
And if the Devil’s looking round in search
of stuff or tools,
He always finds them handy in the Para-
dise of Fools.
QUEENSLAND.
PHILANDER F.
QUEENSLAND GOSSIP.
Brisbane, December 14, 1912.
My Dear Thargomindaii,—
Two of the biggest crowds ever seen at the
Auchenflower tennis courts gathered yester-
day and to-day, to watch the British Isles
team show Queensland how the game is
played. Amongst the multitude was the local
representative of the Australian Union of
Overworked Governors. Like the mere
human beings present he was washed from
his position at the playing ground by a
casual hail-storm, but waited in shelter,until
Providence thought lit to behave itself, when
he returned- to the front and watched the
volleying with ardent interest. He re-
mained until the end, which was about
7 p.m., and then went back to the sub-regal
camp for tea and damper.
The new Governor of the Apple Isle, W.
G. Ellison-Macartney, is first cousin to our
ex-Minister E. 11. Macartney. Mrs. Ellison-
Mac. is a sister of Captain Scott, of Ant-
; arctic fame, and, judging by her photograph,
is tall, slim, dark, and distinctly good-
looking. Speaking of E. H. Mac., you
have no doubt heard that he has withdrawn
SISTER ARTS.
BILL: “Did yer eve?- see that trick
before — makin' a puddin ’ in a
hat?"
JIM: “No; but I've read about
paper bag cookery."
himself from Digby Denham’s Cabinet. He
was one of the very few popular Ministers,
and his loss will be considerable to a team
that may have to take the count at any
moment.
Major and Mrs. A. J. Boyd celebrated
their golden wedding last week. Girls’
Clubs. Friendly Societies and the Anglican
Synod all rolled up with their little remem-
brances, and the National Council topped
the heap with a vdry beautiful Maltese lace
scarf.
Rachel Brunton Stephens, youngest
daughter of the late Queensland poet, is to
be married shortly to one Calow. This
afternoon Mrs; Stephens and her four popu-
lar daughters gave a send-off tea at Eschen-
hagen’s.
Miss Wilkinson, who has been headmis-
tress of the Girls’ Grammar Schol for almost
13 years, is leaving, to the deep regret of all
the girls. The reason of her retirement has
not been given, but it is generally understood
that things were intolerably unpleasant for
her. She came to the school when it was
regarded w r ith a doubtful eye by fond parents
and careful guardians, and has ever since
been the good friend to all girls who came
under her desirable influence.
Fanny Durack, from your bit of Aus-
tralia, gave an exhibition in the Government
docks here last Saturday, which showed how
liuman-like are fish when it comes to swim-
ming. Fanny won the laurel crown or some-
thing for being the best barracouta at the
Olympic games recently, and I don’t wonder
at it after seeing her in the water. As a '
side show, the Barry Cup was competed for,
and the marine drill of three teams of girls
was of a high class. Also, there were some
other splashings, but Fanny was the Phryne
of them all.
The races, last Saturday and to-day, were
of the dullest. No best gowns were seen on
the lawn, which was sodden with rain and
disarranged by hailstones on both occasions.
One of our daily papers, the other day, in
its report of a concert, let itself go in ad-
°f hat was Panted as “that noble
e°T’ Rum t f or the Leper.’ ” After all, life
even on a lazaret has its compensations.
Queensland Irish Association went
i to its annual, picnic last Saturday, the
1 rn, uclnc * a being the means of convey-
.„ce' . Jhose who didn’t enjoy themselves
flax en t mentioned it so far. Another picnic
on the Lucinda, last Wednesday, was not so
ortunate. A violent gale and hailstorm
arose, and 000 seasick children (it was a
school picnic) and their agitated teachers
were swaying in a congested heap about the
none-too-roomy saloon.
Yours affectionately,
AUSTRALIA JANE.
I.B. : Shearers out this Longreach way
are complaining that they can’t make big
tallies this year owing to exceptionally
heavy fleeces and a peculiar “glueyness” of
the wool, due probably to the abundance or
quality of the green feed. Last year’s clip
was a record, over 34,000 bales being railed
away from this terminus, and it looks as if
the current year will easily beat that. From
all appearances contract shearing will soon
capture every shed in the Central West.
Aramac and Corinda have decided to start
on the system next year, which will leave
only Wellshot, Barcaldine Downs, Bowen
Downs and Isis Downs to do their own bar-
bering.
On the first day of each month Barnes,,
Bananaland’s Treasurer, receives a postal
note for £l. No name is given, no address
is enclosed. The only word that accom-
panies the remittance is “Conscience” ; and
to further impress the pangs the individual
suffers, that word is printed in with pricks
as of a pin. On receipt of the document,
“Bishop” Barnes, it is said, utters words of
thanksgiving for one sinner that repenteth.
The resignation of Minister for Lands
Macartney, owing avowedly to a disagree-
ment with Home Secretary. Appel, lends
color to the current gossip that the Denham
Cabinet is anything but a happy family. The
elevation of John White, President of the
Farmers’ Union, to. the position of Minister
for Agriculture shows the increasing domi-
nance of the ultra-Tory bucolic element in
the counsels of the Government, for White
has never shown much sympathy , with Demo-
cratic progress. When the Labor party cut
adrift from its Democratic allies, it little
realised what a lease of power it was giving
to its bitterest enemies.
River trips are an institution in Bris-
bane, and several steamers cater for the car-
riage of Bill and his donah up and down
the river. Announcement is just made by
the authorities that they intend to make
these boats comply with the Board of
Trade regulations as regards safety appli-
ances and the number of passengers car-
ried, not at once but when the present
licenses expire. Good old Le;t-it-slide!
When they have another Pearl disaster and
the river has to be dragged for a week to
get the bodies of the drowned together, it
may begin to dawn on the men in office that
prevention is cheaper than compensation.
Even the municipal-owned rowing-boat fer-
ries that do a large inter-suburban traffic
carry no provision against drowning in case
of accident or capsize.

SEPARA-
[ -TOR
The keen farmer judges by results
Here is a
Proposition
The Melotte
Separator is
placed on the
market at a cost
slightly above
that of the
average cream
separator.
The
Result
The Melotte
has the largest
sale in the
British Empire,
and an annually
increasing one.
The
Conclusion
If the price
|s above the
kverage, the de-
sign, materials,
workmanship,
and construc-
tion, must be
incalculably
above the aver-
age; otherwise
this enormous
sale would be
impossible.
The
Secret
lies in the fact that
once installed,
the Melotte
produces an
increased yield
of the best
cream and butter
throughout a
lifetime of con-
stant use with
practically no
further outlay
for upkeep.

The “MAN-IN-THE-RUSH” needs a
powerful weapon, combining the
qualities of lightness, strength, ac-
curacy, power and reliability. The
revolver which has all these qualities
is the WEBLEY .360. Although very light
(weighing only lib. 30z.), it makes a big hole, and
is exceedingly suitable for killing injured or danger-
ous cattle. For Station defence it lias no equal,
and is specially adapted for, and used by all the
principal banks, as a “Gold Escort” revolver.

ARE YOU
DEAF?
If you are deaf, or going deaf, you will be glad tc
near of a simple and scientific device which restores
hearing, no matter how old you are. No mystery or
secrecy about it; we describe it fully, and explain
just how it acts. You use spectacles as sight magni-
fiers, and in the same way you use this round magni-
ner to hear better. Unlike spectacles, the Wilson
Common-sense Ear-Drums are invisible and comfort-
able. No one can tell you are wearing them. They
rest the ear nerves by taking the strain off them—the
strain of trying to hear indistinct sounds. What a
relief to have done with that tiring strain. Being
made of the softest Para rubber they cannot be felt,
even when the head rests on a pillow. For the same
reason, a blow on the side of the head will not hurt
the ear. They protect the tender inner parts of the
ear, that are so sensitive, from cold winds, dust, sud-
den and piercing sounds.
So that you may clearly understand how the Sound
Magnifiers restore hearing, we give an illustration of
one as it lies in the ear. You will notice that the
Sound Magnifier is shaped like a trumpet, and so con-
veys even the faintest sounds right to the natural drum.
Being of the softest rubber, it cannot hurt the ear.
It fits the orifice of the ear
with precision and comfort.
The division that runs
across the mouth is to al-
low the removal and inser-
tion of the Ear-Drum, and
to brace it.
The shape of the Wilson
Ear-Drum has been chosen
after years of experience as
the best adapt-
ed to carry the
faintest sound.
Of course, if
you have lost
the h e a r i ng-
nerve com-
pletely, or were
born deaf, we
cannot pretend
e<?
fW
to cure you. Only a miracle could
do that, in spite of some of the
absurd claims made to-day. But
of you can hear the faintest sound,
do not despair. You will never
regret trying the Wilson Ear-
Drums. We have letters to show
you from deaf people in Australia
and New Zealand, who have been
cured, and you can be cured, too. You may wear
the Ear-Drums day and night, and take them out
whenever you . wish. Children can wear them (we
have special sizes for children from six to twelve).
Even a child can insert and remove them without the
least danger.
The price is £1 (the fee for a doctor’s single
visit). This includes a pair of drums (they are only
sold in pairs), a fine nickel remover, and also an
inserter. After the first pair is bought you may pur-
chase a single drum at any time for Bs., but the
pair you get at first will last quite two years. Do
not ask for a trial pair. We do not send them out
on trial, and so they are never secondhand. Use the
Order form below, and the Outfit will be sent you
at once, with the fullest instructions. Don’t delay,
but have the comfort of good hearing as soon as you
can.

By Cuticura Soap and Ointment.
Doctor Called It “the Itch.” She
Could Not Sleep and Used to
Scratch Herself to Pieces.
v *\ had a young baby left In my care about
two years ago, and the child caught a very
severe form of skin disease. She was only
a few months old when the skin disease
first appeared on her body just like little
water blisters under the skin, and it used
to irritate the child that much, that she
could not sleep night or day, and she used
to scratch herself to pieces. Even in her
sleep, she would scratch. So I took her to
the doctor after trying a patent ointment,
and he told ine it was a very contagious
tiiseash’, called, the itch. I kept going to
thC tidKWi”, but nothing he gave me seemed
td 'dd the child any good, so I took her to
Si&dtn&r doctor and he gave me every possible
kind of ointment that he could prescribe, but
it all did no good.
“Then I saw one of the Cuticura adver-
tisements and I at once sent for a sample
and applied it. I found that it seemed to
cool the affected parts at once, so I procured
a pot of Cuticura Ointment and a cake of
Cuticura Soap, and bathed the child all over
with warm water and then applied the Cuti-
cura Ointment. In a few days I was aston-
ished at the difference, the more so, because
the child had been suffering so long, for
twelve months, and such a state she was in.
The whole of her body and even her head
was affected. It is six months since I left
off using the Cuticura Remedies, and she
hasn’t had a sign of the trouble since.
“I had tried everything for it. but nothing
seemed to ease or cure it, till I tried the
Cuticura Soap and Ointment. Then she
seemed to get ease directly it was applied
and T continued to apply it till the trouble
disappeared entirely and she was entirely
cured by the Cuticura Soap and Ointment.

An Interesting
Experiment.
If you would like to see the alteration Grey
Hairs make, just lay a piece of paper over each of
the two halves of the above portrait. The Grey
<« half ” will then be seen to have the appearance
of 45 years of age, whereas the other half looks
only 30. Dr. B. Allen’s (U.S.A.) Mexican Walnut
Stain will make all those years of difference if you
are grey or prematurely grey. It is perfectly
harmless, easy to apply, and will quickly restore
the hair to the natural shade of youth, or younger
years.

The above clearly shows Results from a Short Course of my True Hair-Growing Compound.
10,000 FREE TRIAL BOXES.
Those who are troubled with falling hair, dandruff,
baldness, itching scalp, etc., know full the
humiliation that they cause. There is no need, how-
ever, of such conditions. These troubles can be
quickly overcome by my True Hair Grower.
I am not an advertising quack, but am a business
man. My hair began to grow thin about the time
I reachla the age of thirty. When I had reached the
age of thirty-five the top of my head was quite bald.
I had considerable pride, and sought for something
to cause renewed growth. I invested in every pre-
paration that I could see or hear of, and here let me
say that not only did I try all the English so-called
restorers, but those of Continental Europe. I also
visited specialists. My experimenting cost me many
sovereigns and considerable time —-yet the hairs came
not. I had given up the idea of ever growing hair
again. One afternoon, while enjoying a brief busi-
ness respite by an Alpine trip, I fell in with an old
collegiate chemist, whose hair was particularly plen-
tiful. I jokingly remarked that I wished he could
spare some of his hair for my benefit. This lead him
to tell me that he understood the human hair as well
as a good dentist understands teeth. He wrote out a
formula, and suggested that I have a quantity of the
compound prepared. I did this a few days later. I
was astonished to see the hair coming forth after
several applications, and within six weeks my head
was covered by a firm, yet soft, black growth of hair.
Since then the hair on my head has been as luxuriant
as when in my school days. Having arranged for
the legal right to do so, I have for some time been
privately selling this marvellous hair-growipg com-
pound. I hold over one thousand letters from people
who have actually grown new hair through the
medium of my true hair grower. I do not pretend
to say it is the only hair grower in the world —I am
not interested in decrying others —but I do assert
that it is the most reliable, and in the end by far the
cheapest.

New Slums for Old.
From “Mary McCommonwealth” i—
. The Sydriey City Council is out to solve the HiAiS-
}iig problem, by replacing the £lum of
Chippendale with brick tenements. The plans have
been published, and Show three-storeyed mansions oi
many flats, which are to have drying grounds on the
roofs, and grass plots and gardens several mches
wide in front. They contribute very, little to the
solution of the housing problem and, considering
the value of the ground on which they are to be
erected, it is pretty certain that, if they are all they
prb.fbss tb be in thfe matter bf air space, sanitation
hhd convenience, they are going to be precious bad
business for the city from a flriancial point of view.
In plain fact, the city cannot afford to let Suites
of moderri, up-to-date rooms, in a centre of dense
population, at rentals which the dispossessed sium-
dwellerg can afford to pay. Further, each flat m
the new buildings is supposed to consist of a living-
room, two bedrooms, kitchen and bathroom; and as
the rents must in any case be comparatively high, it
may be regarded as certain that bedrooms and liv-
ing rooms will very soon be overcrowded. The big
familv (or two or three families, as the case may
be) will, as of old, try to squeeze itself into .the
narrowest possible space. A couple of the. bov.s
camp on the kitchen table; Mary, aged 12, will
have a stretcher in the bathroom; and no system
of inspection, or protest on the part of the public
landlord, will be of any avail to remedy matters in a
perpetually growing and always overcrowded city.
The citv' authorities will thus have suppbed new
slums for old, and the deficit on the absurdity will
be made up by taxpayer John Smith out of his
wages, with nothing gained except a more ornate
frontage to the street, and the inches of grass plot
and garden previously mentioned. Ihe housing
problem is not going to be solved in this way.
Many of London’s old mans’cns are to-day numbered
among its worst slum-dwellings, and a big building
is no sort of guarantee of comfort for those who
live in it. The citv must spread out in the sunshine
if it is to be a place worth living in; and if it
can’t snread to suit the convenience of its people, it
had better stop spreading, and let some other places
which have room and scope for 50 years of wholesome
growth take up the running.

“Die Mini” on the Freetrade paradise: -
One Cole Bentley, a Victorian football vice-
president, has been to England after 36 years in
Australia, and, returning, lias been reported as- say-
ing this: “We used to pride ourselves that Australia
was the land of the free, but I am satisfied that for
freedom and general happiness there is nothing to
compare with England.” That is the fustian; “what
are the facts? Professor Bowley, in the Contem-
porary Review, estimated lately that there were
about 8,000,000 men employed in regular occupa-
tions In the United Kingdom, Of whom 33 per cent.,
or one-third, do not get more than 255. weekly, 42
per cent, get between 255. and 355., and the rest get
from 365. to 465. Of agricultural laborers, 956,185
earn frotn 9s. 3d. to 20s. 9d., and feed and keep
themselves. Can these men be free and happy ?
Why, most British industries are based on sweating
and low wages, and those things do not usually make
for freedom and happiness, can any country refus-
ing a vote to every woman be called free in the full-
est sense? But while refusing women the "vote,
England still permits the employment of women
and young children in the most strenuous occupa-
tions. Are the women chain-makers of Crad-
ley Heath, or the white-lead workers of Swan-.
sea, the quarry Workers of Denbigh, or the
coal miners of South Wales, or the poor devils of
London dockers who receive 6d. an hour, free ana
happy? Over two millions of paupers were relieved
last year, of whom one million were entirely sup-
ported by the State. Again, an infantile mortality
of 109 deaths under a year old per every 1000 births,
doesn’t prove an enormous amount of enjoyment
amongst British matrons. Crime has increased
enormously. The number of indictable offences in
1909 was 67,149, compared with an average for
1894-8 of 52,208. Britain imports nearly four-fifths,
of its food, having turned its farms into deer parks
and game preserves. It has only three weeks’ sup-
ply of food on hand, and, therefore, it would take
exactly three weeks to starve 45,000,000 of
people to death. If the poodle dogs, Persian cats
and canaries, etc., were eaten, they could last an-
other week. Then—chaos! No! Any country
which allows, 360.,000 of its best, healthiest and
strongest people to emigrate every year, and' per-
mits 250,000 low-class aliens to immigrate, is not
so free nor so happy as the ungrateful Cole Bentley
would have us believe. Why is it that it is usually
the most prosperous immigrants in Australia who
are the first to run down this country, its people and
its laws?
“Overseas” from a Yankee hub: —
Time, .was, and may be even yet, when in Aus-
tralia certain sections of the press, and not a few
public men, were continually telling Australians that
the progressive legislation (only they didn’t call it
“progressive,” “idiotic” being their pet word) was
making Australia the laughing stock of the world.
The Australian felt properly ashamed of himself —and
enacted more “idiotic” legislation, causing more
whoops of disgust. And the world didn’t laugh—
not that you could notice. . Now comes the Ameri-
can Presidential election and the consequent building
of platforms; and the legislation that some folks
would have Australians believe is “the laughing-
stock of the world” is incorporated in those plat-
forms as main planks ! Say the platform builders:
“These things are not experiments, but are in actual
operation among some of the foremost peoples of the
earth—Australia, Germany, England,” with Australia
mentioned first. So America learns the lesson that
not in all things is it the “pathfinder of the peoples”
—-and the Australian in America holds his head an
inch or two higher, and looks around.
At the last N.S.W. General Election the
vote of the pen-pusher did something to beat
the Wade party by a nose. It was the atti-
tude of Wade towards the clerk that caused
thousands of men to vote “to give Labor a
show.” Ever since it got its show the Labor
Government has been promising to bring
clerical workers into line with other toilers
in the schedule of the Industrial Arbitra-
tion Act. Now the Leg. Council has turned
down for a second time the resolution tc
bring them where they would fain be, and
the Government seems to take the leek with
the utmost calmness. If the Wharf-laborers’
Union had formulated such a demand, the
Government would no doubt have waded in
to the Council tooth and claw; yet there are
probably 1000 clerks to every wkarf-labore]>,
and the clerical votes are much more doubt-
ful.
The sooner 1 a strong, earnest, enthusiastic,
Australian is put at the head of the Public
Instruction Department the better for
N. S. Wales and the service. At present
the Director of Education also has the job
of Under-Secretary, and the two billets can’t
reasonably be filled by one man. In a recent
question asked before Parliament it was
stated that 40 male teachers who had held
the IB certificate for from 10 to 20 years
could not gain the coveted 1A certificate
because of the red • tape which prevents the
Chief Inspector visiting their schools. In
this way a few pounds may be saved in
salaries, at the expense of cruel injustice
and widespread dissatisfaction. 1 Yet lately
16 mistresses of infant departments were
promoted from 2A grade to IB grade for
good service; that is, transferred from
second-class to first-class schools without ex-
amination. Inequalities like these, and, in
fact, the stupidities accompanying the
whole system of promotion, simply yell aloud
for the appointment of a strong man to ad-
minister things. Peter Board is no doubt
an excellent educationalist, but an excellent
educationalist isn’t necessarily even a mod-
erate administrator.

THE NEW WAY.
How Any Meal Can Be Thoroughly
Enjoyed by Any Stomach.
Men, as a rule, are first discovered by their enemies. Their antagonists turn,
on the searchlight, and the proof of merit will lie in being able to stand the flash.
nr l* ° nly m thlS , way that Ml ‘--Jones ever knew that dyspepsia was one of
Mr. Smith s worst enemies. Sitting face to face at a two-by-four table he handed
his afflicted friend the bill of fare:—
Oyster Cocktail.
Stuffed Olives.
Boston Clam Chowder.
Strained Gumbo.
Sirloin Steak, with Mushrooms.
Roast Beef Hash.
MENU.
Boiled Ox Tongue, with
Sauerkraut.
Pineapple Fritters.
Lobster ala New burg.
Baked Pork and Beans.
Combination Crab Salad,
Hot Mince Pie.
Mr. Jones ordered a “little of each.”
i Mr. Dyspepsia Smith ordered biscuits and a glass of milk. “I had such a big
bieakfast this morning, he said,, “that I’ll just take a bite to keep you company.”
ut Mr. Jones could not be deceived. “I’m afraid you can’t stand the gleam, Mr.
Mmth. Why don t you say you have dyspepsia, and be done with it 7 You’ll
always have that hungry look, anyhow, as long as you have dyspepsia. Now,
listen. My stomach was in just as bad condition as yours at one time, but now I
can eat anything at any time.
For instance, this clam chowder, or sirloin steak, or even the lobster, would bo
just as welcome to. my stomach, as your biscuits and milk. You don’t realise how
this dyspepsia business is robbing you of your spirit or your energy and ability
to think quickly. I can’t help notice it. You haven’t the cheer and sociability
you had three months ago. Now, I’ll tell you what to do,” and thereat the cheerful
Mr. Jones took a tin from his pocket, and, extracted a wee Tabule. “There!
there is a tabule that contains an ingredient, one grain of which digests 3000
grains of food. For even the worst dyspeptic it’s the only thing that really gives
relief. The reason.is, it relieves the stomach.of nearly all the work it has to do,
digests everything in. the stomach, and stimulates the gastric juices. I can’t get
along without them. They are
Dr. Sheldon’s Digestive Tabules
These TABULES are sold everywhere at 1/6 and 2/6 a tin. Buy a tin, eat
a good, square meal, and then take the TABULES according to directions, and
note the result. You will forget all about it if you are not careful, for there will
be NO PAIN or disturbance, and the food will be DIGESTED just is it used to be
when your STOMACH was .WELL and STRONG. Furthermore, your stomach
will soon be restored again if you keep on taking them, just as thousands upon
thousands of other stomachs have been by the sole and exculsive use of DR.

Fat.
[FOR THE BULLEITN.]
Fat vanishes. True success at last. Double chin
disappears.— From, a recent advt.
HE Millennium approaches. And Ac-
I cumulated Fat
• 1 Shall no longer smear Creation from
beneath a shining hat;
For Rotundity and Adipose, in overlapping
rolls,
Shall be absent when the question is decided
at the polls.
Many years we tried to scotch him with our
unions and our boards ;
Tried to separate His Fatness from his
, badly-gotten hoards;
Many nights our wise men pondered ; hours
of sleep our leaders lost —
All to see their dreamed Utopias on Dead
Sea waters tost.
We have searched in dusty archives; we
have turned the faded leaves;
We have sought the Grand Solution that
the loom of ages weaves.
But the gods laughed with derision, and they
dipped our dreams in slime —
And Lord Adipose, the corpulent, got fatter
all the time!
Chubby chins, that caused us torment, in the
wrack of fatted years,
And the collar’d clutch of fashion, shall be
gone like childhood’s tears —
Till the paunchy, panting person, with his
wobble and his gout,
When the agitators seek him, will be per-
manently out.
For his hours are notched and numbered ; he
shall vanish in a day—
Like the Arabs’ tents at morning, all his fat
will , steal away.
Trusty tablets shall be taken, and a pill
shall intervene —-
And, lo presto! as by magic, will the whole
wide world be lean !
Fat will vanish —where, I know not. But I
know that he will flee—
Let us hope to give them plumpness who are
not so plump as he.
For the scales required adjustment, and that
shiny, towering hat
Was vociferously loathsome with the bilious-
ness of fat.
Pack away the spacious waistcoat; cut each
collar into two—
The Millennium approaches, and Utopia
passes through!
But our politicians failed us, and our wise
men .schemed in vain,
Till the chemist in his wisdom made the long-
sought answer plain!

The Shepherd Kings of
Canterbury.
THE ESMERELDA DIARY.
[FOR THE BULLEITN.]
I FOUND it when I was in my teens,
during a visit to the old Esmerelda
homestead, long before I had the slight-
est inkling i would one day toil on the Inky
Way. At the time I had not even heard of
that steep and dolorous path, and my sole aim
in life was to master the art of running a
number of vehicles in opposite directions
over the same set of rails without having
collisions. Otherwise I would have stolen
the diary, or at least have made copious
notes from it. Instead of which I took it
out into the old walled garden and read it
from cover to cover, absorbed and fascinated.
That was 20 years ago, and memory is uncer-
tain, but no record of the Shepherd Kings of
Canterbury would be complete without some
account of the life and loves of Victoria
Weydon, for many years the richest woman
in Australasia.
It" seems to have been the habit of Victoria
to write down the plain, unvarnished record
of the things she did and the thoughts that
arose within her at least half a dozen times
a day. When anything happened, or an idea
came into her mind, she just wrote it down,
and the habit seems to have develooed a
pretty style of writing and a great capacity
for it, for the diary, I afterwards learned,
ran to 42 volumes of 500 pages each, all
written in a small, close hand in what was
known as the Italian style, with the letters
sloped excessively and large loops above and
below the stave. The volume I discovered
was an intermittent one, and told of her girl-
hood and the affair of the metal worker. It
was bound in green vellum, and stamped
across the face in letters of faded gold:
“VICTORIA WEYDON.”
“My father ate whale’s blubber, and my
pores were correspondingly large, my skin
rough, and my face unlovely. Fortune had
balanced the enormous wealth it gave me,
with a plainness as overwhelming. I brought
skin foods from Paris, cosmetics from
Vienna, and bought me a herd of she asses,
in whose milk I bathed twice daily, but
without avail. My house was full of girls
whose fathers hadn’t two coppers, who had
never had a moment’s care expended on
their complexions, and yet they had faces of
cream and roses, arms and bosoms of ala-
baster.” That was how this extraordinary
l’ecord commenced.. .But after that memory
fails to recall the wording, and I tell the
story in my own language.
The details of this supposed overwhelming
“plainness which can only be truthfully de-
scribed as ugliness of the most pronounced
type,” were given with morbid thoroughness.
It was Victoria Weydon’s one grievance
against Providence, and it was made the
most of. Her hair was lank, and though
the maids brushed it till they dropped ex-
hausted, it stubbornly declined to take any
polish. Her nose she described as being
“like a kea’s beak,” and her chin a bony
point. Her arms were thin, and of an un-
lovely brown tint; her fingers thin and large-
jointed ; her limbs devoid of roundness, and
her feet long and thin. That was her idea
of herself.
Her frantic pursuit of thp beauty she
thought she had not aroused the derision of
her servants, and their scorn cut her to the
quick, till, becoming obsessed with a sense
of her physical defects, the girl shrank from
the sight of even her own household, and
built the walled garden wherfc she might
hide from human kind generallv. And there,
amidst a wilderness of wallflower, holly-
hock, pansies and lilac and laburnum, she
lived in an atmosphere of romantic fiction.
Some of the literature was an unhealthy
type which dilated on the joys of drugs and
opiates, and Victoria, who hated to indulge
in the pleasure of society, proposed to fiiid
solace in hasliisch or something of that sort.
This decision was only arrived at when
she discovered that the reason Canterbury
society avoided her was that her father had
died of some hideous skin disease, said to
be Maori leprosy. Thenceforward Victoria
Weydon was seen no more —till after the
metal worker appeared. The recluse life
she led in the walled garden caused a rumor
to spread that she had developed the same
dreadful disorder. The gardener, toiling
among his flowers with his assistant, would
be warned to leave by the boom of a bell,
and sometimes, as he vanished through the
gate in the wall, he would see a girlish figure
emerging from the glass-fronted apartments
that formed one side of the garden close.
Even the maids who attended her table never
saw her, but received instructions in writing
on little tablets, left her various courses in
hot-water covers, and then quitted the wing
till the bell signalled that their mistress had
retired from the dining-room.
Then the drugs that had been ordered
from far lands came to hand, and Victoria
Weydon gave herself up to hashisch, and cig-
arettes of mountain tea, heavily charged
with opium, while her lucid hours were
solaced with decadent literature.
A great desire for splendor came over her.
She became firmly convinced that her time
on earth was to be very short, and she was
the richest woman in Australasia. So she
would make the best of that limited time,
and build herself a palace, and fill it with
colored people who should be slaves in all
but name.
But, after all, what could be more beauti-
ful than that old rambling Esmerelda House.
All it required to fulfil her dream was in-
terior decoration. She would make it like
Nero’s Golden House. In an unsteady hand
she wrote to her agents in England to send
out the best metal worker for her purpose,
and described exactly what she required.
When he arrived at Esmerelda homestead
he found himself installed in a suite of rooms
looking on to the garden. There was a white
and gold dining-room, a green and gold bed-
room, a smoking-room fitted up at one end
as an office or studio, one side of which was
glass with a top light, and the other three
sides were in peacock blue and old gold. A
small, delicately-inscribed tablet instructed
him to order whatever he required from
Mitchell.. Mitchell, he discovered, was the old
manservant who waited on him, and who had
spent his life in the service of old Ben* Wey-
don, afloat and ashore, and had continued in
the service of his master’s daughter. Mit-
chell was good company, and, as he seemed
to do as he liked and had the run of the
cellar, Ingram Morris, artist, designer and
metal worker, had no necessity to leave his
own apartments in his search for entertain-
nient. Mitchell would take the easiest chair
in the room, ring for whisky and ale, place
a seltzogene on the table, and then, lighting
a long-stemmed churchwarden, let himself go
on the stirring days of the wild times round
the Sounds, of fearsome whale-hunts, of pira-
cies, of Maori massacres.
And Ingram Morris, leaning back in his
chair, smoking his pipe, deeply interested,
would whisper softly to himself, “What an
artistic old liar it is!”
He spent the best part of a week roaming
over the house with Mitchell, working out
his designs and committing them to paper.
When at last they were completed he sent
the papers with estimates of the cost to
Miss Weydon for choice and approval.
He filled in the time till the chosen de-
signs should be returned to him in selecting
copper. One morning he was turning over
some sheets when there was a tap at the
door, and a slight, girlish figure glided into
the studio.
At first he thought it might be Miss Wey-
don, and then he realised his blunder. He
had been told that Miss Weydon was ugly,
and this timid girl who was carrying the de-
signs under _ her arm was decidedly distin-
guished looking. She wore a white dress of
some coarse cloth, a blue silken scarf was
thrown carelessly round her neck ; a battered
straw sun-hat was pinned negligently on her
unruly hair; and her long, slender fingers
were entirely ringless.
“I thought I would like to watch you while
you worked—if you did not mind'. I’ll be
careful not to get in your way. Here are
the designs.”
“Well, I’m not going to work in copper
till 1 get the designs to Miss Weydon’s taste,
but you can stay just as long as you like. 1
like pretty girls for company.”
And the girl in white looked at him with
sudden amazement, but: behind the amaze-
ment he caught a flash of keen scrutiny that
startled him.
“You are the first man who has said I
am pretty!” she said suddenly, relapsing into
simplicity.
He looked at her critically, and then plac-
ing her in the light, stepped back and looked
at her from a professional and impersonal
point of view.
“If I’d seen you before I’d have worked
you into the design. I think I’ll do it now,
and get Miss Weydon to reconsider it.”
“I am commissioned by Miss Weydon to
tell you that the matter is left entirely in
your own hands. You are to do as you
choose, and alter or amend the design as
you think fit. She wants you to do the best
that is in you, and nothing else.”
“Will you let me work your face into the
design?”
“Yes, and I may stay here just as long as
I, like?”
“Certainly ! I suppose you are Miss Wey-
don’s companion?”
“Yes, and secretary!” she added suddenly,
her eye falling on one of the tablets.
“And what am I to call you?”
“Miss Esmerelda —I’m called after the
station.”
* * * *
Back in her own apartments she thought
over the ludicrous situation that had arisen.
It appealed to her imagination. He had mis-
taken her for a servant; he had expressed
admiration for her face. And this man was
an artist —a man whose profession it was to
seek out beauty and commit it to paper, can-
vas and metal. To reveal herself would
spoil it all. She rang for Mitchell, and the
old servitor was aghast when he heard what
had occurred.

Colic, Diarrhoea, and Dysentery
Are diseases that require immediate attention. In almost every neighbourhood
someone has died from these diseases before medicine could be procured or a
physician summoned.
Those who rely upon physicians often find that they are away from home when
most needed.
Every family, and especially those who reside in the back blocks, should keep
at hand a bottle of Chamberlain’s Colic & Remedy.
No physician can prescribe a better medicine for the purpose for which it is
intended. It is invaluable for both children and adults.

“ For eight long years Chamberlain’s Tablets have been the
means of keeping from me those terrible bilious attacks to
which I was a martyr. For years before your wonderful
tablets were recommended to me I lost many hours of rest
with vile attacks of biliousness, but now when an attack is
apparent one to three tablets ward off the horrible suffering
and restore me to perfect health again. My doctor told me
I could only obtain genuine relief by taking a sea voyage, but
thanks to Chamberlain’s Tablets I was saved the time and expense
of this trip and now need no other medicine to keep me well.”
MR. WM. E. GOODE, 107 Victoria-st, Christchurch, N.Z.
“The captain would kick him out, Miss.
Why, when you was a little baby on board
the ship, and Mrs. AVeydon or the nurse
brought you on deck to take the air, we had
to salute you every time we passed. I must
tell him what a dreadful mistake he has
made.”
And the daughter of the captain stamped
her foot and threatened him with eternal
displeasure if he even hinted at such a thing.
“I can get better work out of him, Mitchell;
and I want to eclipse the Grevilles and that
wonderful place that Fernleigh has built for
the selector’s daughter. Am I not mistress
here, Mitchell?”
“Yes, Miss,” said the crushed Mitchell,
backing out, shaking his pink and grey old
head.
After lunch she went back to the studio
and informed the delighted artist that Miss
Weydon had placed her entirely at his ser-
vice. He asked her to resume the silken
scarf and sun hat of the morning, and then
with a variety of spikes and a little mallet
he beat and punched the copper, taking short
quick glances at her the while. After a
while he dropped the mallet, pushed the
copper from him, and called to her to take a
rest.
She stepped forward and looked at what
he had done.
She saw a quaint, elfin face with hair
blown free.
“Is that really like me?” she gasped in
astonishment.
“The very likeness !” he whispered, bring-
ing his head close to hers as he bent, over the
copper.
She looked at him with eyes full of sudden
joy.
He drank in the look, and then hurried to
the other end of the room, and worked fever-
ishly at the desk.
“I had to take it while T remembered it—
for you could never look like that unless you
felt it, and you may never feel exactly
that way again,” he explained, coming hack
to a chair near where she stood.
She was still gazing at the relief, over-
whelmed with the sudden discovery that she
was not hideous. Then she looked up and
saw the artist watching her with an amused
expression. A sudden shyness rushed over
her, and, suddenly dropping her eyes, she
ran out of the room.
That night, while Morris worked hard on
a background and setting, Victoria Weydon,
drugged into a state of ecstasy, played' soft
music on her piano, and repeated over and
over again that this artist had declared her
beautiful. She wanted to go out to him,
but her tottering reason was still sufficiently
in charge of her to forbid it.
Day by day the great panels grew, and
Morris rang the changes on her face. lie
arranged her hair differently, he beat and
twisted and burnished bands of copper to
twine it. over, and he pictured her as many
varieties of simple maiden.
The afternoon when the great panels were
finished they sat out in the walled garden,
and talked of Maoriland, and then of Rome,
Paris and other places. He was astonished
to find her familiar with them all, till she
explained that she travelled through them
with Miss Weydon. As the sun went down
beyond the great blue rampart of the
Southern Alps she rose hastily.
“I have to go now, but as Miss AVeydon is
away for the night 1 have the privilege of
asking you to dine with me. AA’ill you
come ?”
“Certainly—you are very kind!” he re-
marked, suddenly realising that this woman
was more than a servant.
The dinner was over, and they had both
imbibed much champagne. The nor’-west
wind, the sirocco of Canterbury, was blowing,
and the fervent heat seemed to penetrate all
barricades. She pushed across the box of
drugged cigarettes. Her face was hushed,
her eyes were dancing—for after the wine
had gone to his head, his admiration for her
had got the better of him, and he had praised
her without restraint. The fact that he be-
lieved she was wearing her mistress’s jewels
and clothes had at first filled him with con-
temptuous amusement, but as they both ap-
proached the centre of the vortex he had for-
gotten that presumed fact. It was well that
Simplicity panel was finished, for it had
dawned on Ingram Morris’s drink-inflamed
brain that there was more than one side to
her character. But the brute was in all
things an artist, and for the life of him he
could not get away from the picture she made
in her supposedly borrowed finery. Miss
AVeydon might not go away again, and he
wanted to reproduce her as he saw her then.
“Look here, I’m going to make the next
panel a huge etching on copper, and in it
you are going to be a C'_een. This is glori-
ous.”
“It is glorious! I’ve never lived till to-
night—and 1 feel like a queen. I am a
queen.”
“I’ll sketch you while you are in the
mood —to-morrow you will be Sweet Sim-
plicity again.”
His pencil glided over the paper, and at
every rest he reached for the champagne
bottle, while she lit cigarette after cigarette.
The artist sang as he worked, the girl as she
posed. As he finished the impressions the
sheets fell to the floor, and then he stag-
gered to his feet, and slipping one shoulder
out of her evening bodice, pulled down her
hair, covered her tiara with the table
flowers, and sketched her as a youthful
bacchanalian.
Suddenly the air seemed to blow chilly
through the open windows from the walled
garden. The great weight clock boomed four.
He looked at the clock dazedly, and then at
her.
“Are you going?” she whispered.
“Come into the garden, for just five min-
utes,” he whispered, taking her by the arm.
But she took him to the conservatory in-
stead. The heavy perfume intoxicated them
afresh. She sank down on the rustic seat,
dragging him with her, and, hardly knowing
what he was doing, he took her in his arms
and found the face she was holding up to be
kissed.
# * * #
The work was done. Miss AVeydon was
to return home next afternoon and pronounce
her verdict. Then he would collect his
cheque—the biggest he had ever drawn, and
the next day would find him en route for
England.
They went over it all together.
“It’s the best work I have ever done, Es-
merelda, and I have you to thank for it.
I only hope Miss AVeydon will not think I
faave worked you into it too much.”
‘•I will answer for that!” said “Miss Es-
merelda.”
“I'll have to pay you a percentage, you
know !” he laughed, "for it is really as much
yours as mine; and but for you I could
never have made those frightful contrasts—
the atmosphere of musk and murder, and the
Roman touch.”
“And to-morrow you will leave me?” she
said, looking at him with eyes that pleaded
harder than any words. “You have made
life so different to me that I do not think
I shall ever be happy again.”
“It is inevitable, though. That’s the worst
of these sort of love affairs —they’re so
beautiful while they last, but they last so
little time.”
"Why should they?” she asked, with a
catch in her voice.
“Well, you couldn’t come with me, could
you?”
They were hand in hand, and her fingers
tightened on his as she whispered:—
“Yes —if we were married.”
Ingram Morris released his hand.
"Oh. I say, little girl!” Then he stopped.
“Well, ivhat do you say?” she asked after
a long pause.
“You don’t want me to marry you, do
you ?”
"Not if you don’t wish to. Do you not
desire to marry me?”
“Esmerelda, how could I? You know, my
mother lives with me in England, and she
would want to live with us afterwards,
too.”
“I am sure I would love your mother!”
said Esmerelda.
“Of course you would —but that isn’t the
question. You see, little girl, well, you
know, well —you’re a drug fiend, and some-
times you take too much champagne. And I
couldn’t afford champagne.”
“I do not want champagne, Ingram.”
“Well, it’s quite impossible,” he said
suddenly, with decision.
“You don’t think I’m respectable enough
to live with your mother, Ingram ; is that
it?”
“That’s it!” said Ingram gloomily. “Be-
sides, I’m engaged to a girl in Kent.”
“lias she been to you what I have been?”
“Good heavens, no! Her people are very
respectable—her father owns two ships.
They’re moneyed people. Look here, Esmer-
elda, I’ve been very reckless, and I’ve been
cruel. I saw where this was leading to, but
I hadn’t the strength to draw back; and
I’ve been dreading this ever since that first
time we dined together.”
“I have been looking forward to it, also.
You are going to throw me over because this
girl is very respectable. Do you know that
no man had as much as kissed me till you
came? My father owned ships, too, and was
a leader of men. But because I’m a ser-
vant. although a favorite one, she must take
precedence. Or is it that you hope to gain
money by this marriage. 1 thought it was
only women who sold themselves for money.”
"I never said I would marry you, did I?”
“No. you never hinted at it. I thought
so well of you that I made no bargains. But
I would not marry you now if you went on
your knees to me, and there is not the
slightest chance of your doing that, is
there?”
“No-—but look here, I’m going to divide
this cheque with you. I’ll treat you as
decently as I can. Esmerelda. Now, how
much shall we say?—remember, I’ve got my
mother to think of.”
“And the ship-owner’s daughter, who is
very respectable!”
“Well, iff you are going to talk like that,
T shall not discuss the matter further with
you. I’m not going to say unkind things
to you, because 1 suppose I’ve treated you
badly. But I shall just go to my own rooms
and stay there till Miss Weydon comes
home and passes the work.”
“And gives you your cheque! Well, Miss
Weydon is home, and I must go. Good-bye,
Ingram. I don’t know whether I’m broken-
hearted or overcome with joy—bjit it hurts,
whichever it is.”
“Good-bye, Esmerelda. I’m sorry! Now,
how much shall we say for your share?”
But Esmerelda shook her head. A curi-
ously hard look came over her face, her eyes
flashed, she stepped towards him.
“Now, Esmerelda, don’t say it —don’t say
it. I will not have any of your brutal cyni-
cisms thrown at my mother and intended
wife. You’ve read too many bad books.”
“I am not going to say a word about them
—I pity them too much. All I wish to say
is that I believe that had I been Miss Wey-
don instead of her maid Esmerelda *you would
not have given the respectable daughter of
the gentleman who owns two ships a second
thought. I feel sorry for her. and I trust
she may never find you out, as I have done.”
And before he could reply Esmerelda had
vanished through a door leading to Miss
Weydon’s rooms.
Morris stood thinking. The prospect of
this scene had haunted him for days, and
now it was over. She had not played up as
much as he feared. It would have been
awful if she had screamed and brought Miss
Weydon, and blurted out everything before
her. He had got out of it very well.
And ho was still standing there when
Mitchell, whom he had not seen much
lately, approached and handed him a cheque
payable to order. He glanced at the
amount.
“Doesn’t Miss Weydon wish to see me.
before I go?” inouired Morris.
Mitchell shook his head and walked
away. Suddenly he stopped, faced about,
and with a hostile expression said icily:—
“The waggonette is waiting and wiil start
immediately you are ready. The groom will
put your traps on board.”
Morris walked to the window and looked
out. As far as he could see all the land be-
longed to Miss Weydon.
Highly disgusted, he walked down to his
late rooms, muttering that Miss Weydon was
a snob. Arrived, he looked round, took hfs
overcoat over his arm, grabbed his stick.
Then he deliberately walked down the long
corridor walled with his masterpieces, look-
ing at them one by one. Arrived at the
end he took the cheque out of his pocket and
looked at it again. The writing in the bodv
was Esmerelda’s, and, good God, so was the
signature.
The truth burst upon him, and, staggering
with the weight of bis dismay, Ingram Mor-
ris, fortune hunter, blundered out on to the
verandah, down the steps, and into the
waggonette.
He had thrown away the richest woman
in Australasia.
