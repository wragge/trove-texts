THE BULLETIN.
SATURDAY, FEBRUARY 5, 1887
Parkes—The Wilkins Micawber of
New South Wales.
Slit Henry Pakkes, apart from his fanatical
devotion to Freetrade, and the worse than
weakness of his ragged regiment tailed off by
Clark Eand Roberts, must stand condemned
in the sight of the country by reason of his
utter inability to comprehend the true state
of the public finances, and by his nonchalance
with respect to the enormous deficit, now
aggrtigating £2,700,000, and increasing at the
rate of £120,000 per month. He dilates on
the “ deplorable state of the public ac-
counts ” only for the purpose of scolding the
Administration which allowed this burden to
accumulate, and the futility of his quack
remedies of land-selling and pastoral rent-
raising sutticiently proves that he feels not the
necessity of immediate and vigorous action
to redeem the floating debt of the colony.
The sale of land formerly was a powerful
means of covering deficits, but that mis-
chievous expedient has lost its etiicacy, not
only because squatters cannot now be forced
to buy, as was the case in 1878-83, but also
because there is so little land in the colony
which buyers would care to secure. Mr.
Copeland, in 1880, was unable to sell the
public estate by auction even up to the limit
of £200,000, and to prevent a recurrence of
similar failure in 1887 ordered the land
ollicers to allot £500,000 worth for sale in
the hope of quitting two-fifths of the amount.
And further it is a matter within our know-
ledge that land has been offered by circular
to pastoral lessees for purchase in virtue
of improvements six months after such
privilege was by the Act of 1884 allowec,
and yet the offers were in most case
refused. These facts should show the ab-
surdity of expecting a large increase of pro
ceeds of auction sales except at greatly re
duced prices. With theirpresentfixedtenure
which Sir Henry promises to confirm, th
squatters will not buy the land, and pastora
rents are now as high as can possibly be paic.
But Sir Henry has other expedients ; h
will purify the Civil Service, and remove th
railways from politieal influence. Possible
if these reforms are really carried out some
£•'’>00,000 annually may be saved, but that i
a mere trifle oompared with the amoun
necessary to be obtained to bring the expen-
diture within sight of revenue. Beyond
these visionary proposals Parkes also advo
cates the introduction of Local Clovernment
but it is certain no saving will be effected bo-
such a measure for at least two years- afte •
its enactment. 3 hat he should be unawam
of this latter fact is not marvellous, for wliei
he introduced a bill for the same purposi
throe years ago, he knew so little of the
measure that he was totally unable to answe -
simple questions as to its proposed open
tion. Viewing the public financial nccessi
ties and Parkes’ vague and utterly inade
quate remedies, even his devoted Free-Trade
admirers may well credit him with having
sustained his reputation as the Wilkins
Mk-awber of New South Wales politics. Or
ratlmr as we should say he appeals as
another Nero, for while the evei -increasing
deficit is blasting the reputation of the colony
abroad, and paralysing it 3 enterprise at home
he sits on an eminence of presumption and
pride, and sings an empty ode—a Murmur
of the Stream of political buncombe—in
praise of Free-Trade.
To realise the grave condition into which
the colony’s finances have fallen it is
necessary to go back to the former rei»n
of Sir Henry Parkes, which lasted
till January, 1833. In the four years
from 1878 to 1882 inclusive, land to the
amount of £3,783,103 was sold by auction or
other means, being at the average yearly
rate of £1,950,620 ! This, it will' be freely
admitted, was not 11 revenue” in any fair
sense of the term, but it was used by the
Parkes Administration for the purpose of
paying current expenses, and Sir Henry
now has the impudence to claim it as a con-
spicuous virtue that he retired from office
leaving a surplus of nearly £1,800,000 ! But
what of the other £7,700,000 1 That
had all been wrongfully, or at least in-
judiciously, applied in liquidation of the
ordinary expenses of Government. During
these five years the total revenue from all
sources, including the public estate, was
£28,488,197, of which only £7,673,991 was
obtained by taxation. From all sources, ex-
clusive of laud, the revenue of those years
amounted to £18,705,094; so that if the
capital of the country, the land, had not
been applied in payment of current obliga-
tn ms, the reign of Parkes would have ended
with a deficit of £8,000,000 ! It was only,
and this is the important point to notice now,
the proceeds of land sales tha f enabled Sir
Henry to delude the country with a Fool's
Paradise of surpluses. But with the advent
of the Stuart Ministry to power, auction
sales were limited, and receipts from the
Department of Lands fell to such an extent
as only to reach a total of £5,501,147 from
’B3 to ’B6 inclusive, a total decrease for that
term of £2,325,333 on the average of the
previous five years. Hence it is clear that
the present deficit is not the creation simply
of the last year or two, but is the result of
the wrongful application of land “ revenue ”
under the Parkes reifitne and the subsequent
decrease of that “revenue.”
* * *
But this decrease of land-receipts only
partially accounts for the deficit and its pre-
sent rate of growth. Another cause of this
natural phenomenon is discerned in the rail-
way returns and the growth of the public
debt. At the end of 1882 the loan-ledger
showed a debit of £18,700,000, on which the
interest was £797,000, and the net earnings
of the railways paid all but £77,000 of this
annual charge ; but at the present time the
national debt is £41,000 000 and the annual
interest £1,070,000, ofwhichamount less than
£700,000 is furnished by the railways,
leaving very nearly £1,000,000 annually to
be borne by the taxpayers. And with re-
gard to the increasing inability of the rail-
way's to clear their cost there is the ominous
fact that this arises chiefly from the heavy
losses on several of the recent extensions.
In 1882 there were only 1041 miles of rail-
ways running through settled districts, but
in 1885 the mileage had increased to 1732,
and most, of the added length is not likely to
clear working expenses for the next 20years.
There are more such lines to be opened now,
and it is almost a certainty that Parkes’ re-
trenchment, if effected, will not more than
cover the loss on these additional vote-bought
branch railways.
* * „
It is useless now to blame Sir Henry
Parkes for having scattered the land sale
millions of 1878-82, and idle to upbraid the
succession of wasteful, incapable, and in some
instances corrupt Ministers who have frit-
tered away the public moneys since the latter
date. The point of importance now is that
the colony is £2,700,000 in debt, and is in-
creasing that floating debt at the rate of
£30,000 per week. Our review of the past
nine years was made, not to show that
Parkes, the prodigal, is unfit on account of
past political sins to be again entrusted with
power—although we admit that to be ai
irrefutable inference—nor to prove that the
voter who supports Dibbs is either a traito
or a fool—also a fair inference—but to prove
that the present deficit is the result o
enduring causes, and must be treated a.-
such. Mr. Dimis, w hen reluctantly acknow
lodging the £1,000,000 deficit at the end o
1885, threw,’ the blame of its existence oi
Providence the drought, lie said, had causei
it, the advent of a favourable season woult
wipe out the debt—but Providence has been
merciful in the seasons vouchsafed, and yen
the deficit has increased by £1,700,000 since
Mr. Dibbs declared that no more taxatior
was necessary—a sure testimony to his unfit-
ness for the office he held. He could net or
would not recognise the far-reaching causes
of the deficit the drought was all the reason
he would admit for the national shortage.
Nor ca» Parkes admit the operation of the
causes wo have shown. “A wave of depres-
sion,” “return of public confidence,” “the
more favourable seasons now set in,” —theso
are the phrases he uses to explain the present
debt and the means of its liquidation. So
confident is this political Wilkins Micawber
of getting his promissory note bearing
the alleged endorsement of Providence
discounted that he is willing to at once
renounce Customs revenue to the probable
extent of £400,000 per annum, thus adding
£3.i,000 per month more on to the deficit.
Nor would this be the only result of ad
valorem duties’ repeal. Undoubtedly the
impost of 5 per cent, has had an effect in
stimulating local industry ; more capital has
been invested in manufacturing ; more em-
ploy men t for the working classes provided ;
and a slight stimulus thereby given to every
branch of trade. To repeal these duties
would be to bring about a stagnation in trade
sufficient to influence the public revenue to
an appreciable and unwelcome extent, unless
Providence is prepared to prohibit thoopera-
Ition of natural causes in this matter for the
special benefit of the political reput at ion
such as it is, of Sir Henry Parkes.
Even if we allow that Sir Henry Parkes
is able to save, say, £500,000 by docking ex-
penditure in the railway and other depart-
ments, and to raise even £500,000 more
from the land, this, after the repeal of ail
I‘n^^ dutieS ’ will onl y leave a net gain of
£OOO,OOO, and the depression intensified by
retrenchment as well as by the paralysing of
native industries will subtract a large portion
of this gain from other sources of revenue.
The proposed property-tax will then by
hampering trade and industry still further
add a new factor to the distress, and even if
we exercise imagination to a still greater
degree by supposing this impost to yield
£BOO,OOO, there will not even at that be suffi-
cient cover for the curtailed expenditure,
much less reduction of the existing obliga-
tion. Aggravation of distress, impaired
credit abroad, and an issue of greenbacks at
home are the necessary incidents of such
political quackery as Parkes proposes. We
say Parkes advisedly ; the Hon. J. F.
Burns is Treasurer in name, but he is only
the shadow of his chief. Where Robinson
Crusoe Parkes leads, Man Friday Burns
must silently and submissively follow. A
property-tax when stocks are booming and
business is good, is an infliction, but when
stagnation and industrial disaster prevails it
is a national calamity.
The alternative of the Parkes programme
is as attractive as the latter is repulsive. If
a tax of 10 per cent, were levied on imported
articles of necessity, including agricultural
produce, and 20 per cent, on imported
luxuries, the Customs revenue would benefit
to the extent of fully £OOO,OOO, and other
State receipts would, by the stimulus of
trade and encouragement of industry, largely
increase simultaneously. Then to make up
the revenue still required for current expen-
diture, as well as to provide for the extinc-
tion of the outstanding debt, a land-tax
could be profitably and easily levied. Land-
owners whose property was advanced 20 per
cent, in yearly value by the extension of
manufactures and the advance of agriculture
might reasonably be asked to give 10 per
cent, of that adventitious increment to the
state by whoso policy it had been awarded.
The advantages of such a tax, over a pro-
perty-tax, have been too frequently proved in
The Bulletin columns to need further de-
scription in this article. With a protective
tariff the retrenchment in the departments
capablo of enduring curtailment of the staff',
would not necessarily entail any hardship
Dismissed clerks would find their services in
demand because of the revival in business
circles ; the victims of retrenchment under
the scheme of Sir Henry Parkes would re-
ceive their notes of dismissal at a time when
the gloom of depression was gathering more
darkly round the commercial world.
.» * *
For the sake also of retaining the confi-
dence of the British investor it is absolutely
necessary that a financial programme more
vigorous than that of Sir Henry Parkes
should be exhibited without delay, otherwise
the probability of floating another loan at
reasonable rates is, at the least, very remote.
To stop loan expenditure all at once—and
there is now but a small balance of the last
loan remaining—would, especially under a
Free-Tiade regime , be a cruel blow to the
numberless workers and business-men who
in late years have been induced to look to
that expenditure for their means of life : but
loan expenditure will certainly be stopped
unless a policy more vigorous, and less de-
pendent upon Providence than that of Sir
Henry Parkes, be at once initiated.
Forty Pounds por Head.
Editor Bulletin. —Sir, —A schoolboy can figure
out the following New South Wales is in ilebt
40,000,000 of sovereigns. The population is
1,000,000. Therefore, every man, woman, and
child in tho colony is this day £lO in debt. We,
the elders, will have to pay our proport ion, and our
children will not only inherit the balance, but such
further debts as coming necessities may dictate.
Tho fact, however, is manifest that every married
man in tho country with three children is, to-day,
committed to a debt of five times £4O or £2OO.
And there is no get out of it but by paying it.
But, again, we must omit the bachelors, the
women, and the children. Taking the figures
that way, we shall find that the average wage-
earner or interest-earner is not far from £750 in
debt, and the question is worthy serious consi-
deration whether it would not be cheaper and
more satisfactory to the British capitalist and the
citizens of New South Wales for the whole of the
latter to fix on next Anniversary Day, file their
schedule as one man, and give the Insolvency
Court something like a howling time of it.
Let us press this consideration on Sir Henry
Parkes, who has some knowledge of such
matters:—(l.) The first source of wealth is
the land surface and the sea-depths. Prom
these only is food obtainable. (2 ) The second
source of wealth is in exchanging w hat has coat
one worker less in procuring than it would cost
another worker. And that is measured by the
quantity of certain rare metals discovered under
the surface of the earth—at the present time by
gold and silver ; in ten thousand years hence
possibly by iron, or by chunks of coal. This is
what is meant by wealth obtained by dealing, or
as the economists put it, "wealth gained’ by
shrewdness and brains in seizing the best oppor-
tunities for advantageous dealing.” Wealth ob-
tained by gambling, by special artistic endow-
ments, literary or otherwise, are only adispensible
fraction, and may be omitted in calculations of tho
bulk wealth of the world. (3.) The final measure
of all value whatever is the worth in food, clothes,
moral, physical, and intellectual training, for one
honest civilized man working a reasonable number
of healthful hours out of every twenty four. .
These propositions are not stated in that fashion
in any treatise on political economy that we have
yet consulted; but they are, in outline, pretty much
the conclusions of every man who has the leisure
and capacity to turn from thebabble and jargonof
self-seeking men, and find out for himself what
are really the wants of the time. , . (4) Wealth
here means "weal”—the welldoing of honest
healthy workers. Tying ourselves down to these
definitions, we ask : Why does Sir Henry Parkes
now turn up as an old man, and propose to sell the
surface of the earth for cash, when that oash has
to bo raised by loans from usurers 1 Why does ha
desire to mortgage the future of our children by
finding for a continent, so far only fringed with
population, a market, helpless in face of slop,
pauper, and Chinese and Indian labour, when
with our almost compulsory centralisation in
cities, we dwell on a territory capable, after a
while, of swallowing up any number of foreign
millions and making them the useful ragpickers
Nature so far has murked them out for l A fre
port means nothing else than undue facilities fo
such traders. As surely as the sun shines, ther
are leading laces as there are leading men. Then
if the lands go by auction, they go to the higlies
cash bidder in to-day's usury market. The mus
cles, or brains, or future necessities of ou
children, have nothiDg to expect from this far
seeing statesman. Who knows ? Through som
ass in power, purchasable by a gewgaw title
some Federation “ gag ” may be made binding
and we may tind ourselves pounded to death by
handful of those iqfernal Kussian, German, o
French over-grown larrikin nations, and not have
the means of producing a pound of powder, a gun
a strip of blanket for our men, a pit ugh, a reaping
machine, a steel rail, or a locomotive by which t(
send mon to meet a few regiments of the scum o]
Europe, come down here for plunder, and to get
the first square meal of beef and mutton they ever
knew in their livos. And we shan't have a home
made boot or a saddle, because the importers ol
shoddy from old-world slave factories control the
market and will have their piofics although the
rest of the people who make their property safe
may have to go to the devil in consequence.
There is only one way open to an henest
man or a community to pay debts. It is to
reduce unnecessary expenditure and add to in-
come. Sir Henry l’arkes proposes the pawn-
shop solution of pledging land at a ruinous
interest for the ultunate redemption, and of crip
pling the manufacturing interests just struggling
into life. This is certain'y an old way of paying
new debts, and one discredited in every leading
nation of the earth. It is the way that has landed
New South Wales over head and ears in debt.
The land will increase in value with increased
population. We have no guarantee whatever that
the world’s market is to remain open to us. We
must find our market higher for a time, and such
moderate Protection as may now be granted will
prove infinitely cheaper than a free port that means
deprivation of freedom to all inside, and helpless
dependence on outsiders for our immediate wants.
Our lands, our foreshores, our river frontages,
and our mechanical resources within our own
boundaries are (he only means we can rely upon
for squaring our forty pounds per head, and no
land auctions and no Civil Service cheese-parings
can ever do it. Nor can any other l’arkesian
“ fake,” fake he never so wisely.
JOHN SMITH.
PLAIN ENGLISH.
A Freetrade Confession.
Tiie stock argument of Freetraders against Pro
tection is that it increases the price of com mod
ties to consumers without giving any correspont
ing advantage to them. The fallacy of this theor
has been clearly shown by the experience o
count ries which have adopted t he protective pol icj
but either through blind perversity ur interests
motives the advocates ol Freetrade adhere to the
theory with us much tenacity as a limpet does t
a rock. Let anyone road the addresses of th
N.B.W. Freetrade candidates for the presen
general election, and the articles in the Freetrad
newspapers, .and he will see that the burden o
their song all t hrough is that Protection necessarily
overburdens the poor man, and that the only per
son who benefits by it is the manufacturer. The
Protectionist has a complete answer to the asser
tion, but we will not trouble ourselves to state i
here; we prefer ta give a crushing refutation 01
the theory on the authority of a newspaper which
a few months ago nibbled at Protection, but now
advocates ultra Freetrade. In the Sydney Daily
Telegraph of Saturday last we find under the
heading '' Commercial” the following paragraph .
Not much doing in candles, though cable advices repor
an advance ot id. i-i England. With lighter stocks, owina t,
the low prices „/ Uwal malts, it now lemains to bo >eci
I Whither the pj.sible repeal of [.resent duties, as promised b»
the present Government, will, by checkin „ local supplies give
au increased impetus to the imported article, umler which cir-
cumstances values miphl be expected to advance."
The duty on candles is one of the incidental/!/
protective items contained in the existing Now
South Wales “free-trade” tariff, and according
to this paragraph the accidental honesty of which
is calamitous to the D.T.—it has had
the effect of so stimulating local production as to
load to a considerable fall in the price of a com-
modity which is a requisite in every household,
but more so in that of the “ poor working man ”
than in that of his better-favoured fellow. Repeal
the duty, close the local factories, and then we
may expect an increase in the price of the im-
ported article ■ This may be very sound policy to
pursue in the interests of the “ mammoth mono-
polist"—the importer—and the foreign manufac-
turer who has no interest in the colony beyond a
desire to draw its treasure from it; but what
about the interests of the thousands of consumers
into whose pockets they will dip their fingers, and
those of the hundreds of men employed in the
manufacture of candles in the colony and the
leeal tradesmen who benefit by the circulation of
their wages i The statement contained in the
paragraph which we have quoted will doubtless
apply with equal truth to many other commodities
which are manufactured locally. The rich in-
terested importers—the M'Mjllions if Sydney—
who have everything to gain by Freetrade, the
political charlatan who will advocate any cause
on which he thinks he may force himself into
place and pay, a*d the superficial individual who
reads musty books dealing with but one side of the
question—the arguments being based on oondi-
tions which do not exist in New- South Wales
and closes his eyes to the actualities of life which
surround him, may write columns of high sounding
phrases in favour of Freetrade, but they will fail
to refute the reasoning of this ten-line paragraph
which we now commend to the serious attention of
the electors of New South Wales.
Mr. M‘Millan, Gentlemen !
Or him the Sydney Herald says ;
"He did net wish to enter political life at the present
juncture; but he has yielded to the solicitation of his friends
from a sense of duty, believing that in the e° t0t1.2 ,£!ta of
men who have any capacity ac all for pu-lic work
should hesitate for a moment—no matter what the strain
be ~ in I)lacing them selves at the disposal of
H ® W ‘ U , therefore appear on the hustings as a
political hero, a kind of Free-Trade Cuimus who
5L I®" o ,ar "'i? g sacrifice ” is Prepared to leap into
the cavity in the* national finances. He is worthy
of special notice, for, being a partner in the huge
importing firm of Messrs. M‘Arthur and Co. he
may be taken as a representative of the class of
foreign manufacturers’ agents commonly called
importers. They as a class have always been
considered the most selfish although the most
h'ghly-fuvoured in the country. No such
repiescntative importer has ever figured


I at the hustings before in N.S.W. ; it is only when
Mr M’Mili/on's capacious pocket is touched by
ad valorem duties that lie concerns himse’f about
the political salvation of New South W ales. tie
is, of course, a “staunch Freetrader, just as
every gcebung politician is a “loyalist,’ and yet
according to his own statement, the ad valorem
duties are a source of proilt to him, for he pays
that if 10 per cent be imposed the importer s-o
per cent, (moderate profit th:'s 'or a foreign manu-
facturers’ agent !) must be charged against the
retailer, who in turn will add 20 per cent, more,
making the extra cjst to the consumer at least lo
percent. This is the argument also adopted by
Henry George, but known facts overthrow this
contention completely. It is, for instance, a
known fact that the 5 per cent, recently imposed
in New South Wales is borne by the importers ; it
is a fact that foreign golds now do not cost the
consumer more, unless in a very few exceptional
lines than they did before the duties were im-
posed ; it is certain that every importer in Sydney
is violently opposed to ad valorem duties at all,
and it is beyond doubt that Mr. M Million
has at great “strain” to himself been an-
nounced as a candidate for East Sydney. It is
time that this pretence of patriotism was stripped
from such Ereetrade candidates; it deludes no
one not even the applauding leader writers of the
morning papers. Let Mr M'Mill.on announce
himself as an opponent of the importers bane
the ad valorem duties—and dila e on the fact that
the foreign goods depots, the Sydney importing
houses are made to renounce part of their huge
profit for the benefit of the State revenue-let him
do this and the magnanimity ot his sacrifice in
going to Parliament to oppose those duties will hs
at once apparent. As it is now he doesn t got all
the credit that he is entitled to for his noble action
in thus sacrificing himself on the altar of- Im-
porters profits.
Dibbs a Freetrader.
Till'. Sydney Ereetrade press, in order to dis-
credit the Protectionist cause at the coming elec-
tion has done its level best to saddle the party
with Mr. G. H Dibbs. Because he is opposed to
IParkes thev assume that he will he the Premier
of any future Ministry formed under the auspices
of Protection. This is a clever dodgo The
alliance, while Mr. Thompsons acc saLon of
estimate-co iking is still unanswered, would be
enough to damn the best political cause on earth.
Bat it must he remembered that Mr. Dibbs is, and
always has been, ‘ a Freetrader to the hack bone,
and if ever returned to Parliament again is much
more likely to be a colleague of bir Henry
Pahkes than of any other leader. That the two
have reviled one another lately is not the slightest
reason why they should not become colleagues
if such a companioaship assists either of them to
obtain cr retain ortice for a single dan. I’akkes
now has,ashis Mi nisterof Lands, t he same Garret i
whose continuance in the House he once
asserted to be “ a red-hot brand of shame that
would “ never be wiped out,” while his Treasurer
is the same “ Cocky ” Bprns wr li whom he abso-
lutely refused to be associated less than a year
„,o ' “ The dog that has returned to his vomit
twice will feel no shame in repeating the perfor-
mance a third or even a thirtieth time. \V hen
the Pakkks Ministry meets Parliament there
will be several portfolios, notably that of Justice,
and probably of Lands also, to be re-allotted, and
?„ the remote event of their bemg enctuh idiots in
the Murrumbidgee electora e to give Mr Dibbs a
seat he will be about the most likely man to ac-
quire office. Still, for all that, any Protec-it mat
would be worth ten seats to tbe cause who would
go to Wagga as a professed opponent of Mr.
Dibbs. The lie has been told, and has be-
lieved and therefore should be effectually dis-
Droved. Not alone among Freetrader?, but among
sincere Protectionists also has the feir ob ained
that Dibbs will lead the party w.-en victorious
into office We believe in men who vote accord-
ng to principle, but could forgive a man who
threw away his vote on a freetrader evenjn
Pahkes himself, to prevent G R Dibbs from
again assuming office in New South Wale..
Carlyle and Country Newspapers
THE Melbourne Age quotes wi ll approval the
following passage from Carlyle:
“ Thprp * no church, sayest thou? The voice of 1 . ophecy

humour when he wrote this or else he knew as
much about country newspapeis as a shovel-footed

thing about country newspapers. W e purcha.ei

Li3t Me Alone!
It may not. bs genera’ly known that the Prince cf
Darkness once owned a penny newspaper. It was
a highly moral little prior, too, and whoa it filled
up with gentlemanly garbage trimmed with gal-
lows it did so with a view of inculcating a valu-
able lesson, and not from any sinful intent. The
proprietor rightly considered that the public could
not avoid committing the most atrocious sins un-
less they knew precisely what these same sins
were, so he described them in full, and at the
same time he denounced them with slimy unction
and cursed all those who in sheer wantonness
taught such wickedness. Tnis journal, we regret
to say, is long since defunct, but we may note
that the sulphurous publisher was not forced to
file his red-hot, cast-iron schedule—he grew rich
instead, and sold out of the venture and built a
new Goh°nna with the profits. We quote this
I little story apropos of nothing in Heaven above
or in earth beneath, or in the other place which is
more beneath still, but somehow it was recalled
to our minds on reading in the Sydney Echo the
following criticism on " Neck for Neck” as pro-
duced at Sydney Gaiety:
'’lf to pa-der to the very lowest tastes of the very lowest
class, to provide it with sensationalism of the most revolting
kind, and to feed to the very utmost that craving for the
morbid which seems to be inhtrent in boys of a certain age—
if this be to confer a benefit on the theatre-going public,
then the Vivians, who have just commenced a season at the
Gaiety, may fairly claim to have excelled all previous com-
petitors in that particular line. The most revolting thing
about “ Neck for Neck/' however, ] s the gallows-scene. In
this diabolical piece of realism the whole painful scene which
was recently enacted at Darlioghurst with such terribl9
reality is gone over again.”
We would ask by what mortal right the Sydney
Echo objects to the Gallows and the Gaiety l The
drama is understood to be the picture of exis-
tence as it is, not merely as it should he, and
though there are tome things in this world too
hideous to be depicted on the stage, surely the
Ecailold and the nocse cannot ho among them—
else why did the Echo vote for their retention?
Only a few days ago tint journal called for the
gallows to ireuleate a great moral lesson and
strike terror into the hearts of the vilest of the
vile, then why should not Mr. Vivian bring the
lesson and the terror home to the vile, noisy, and
unkempt ruffians who swarmed in the gallery cf
the Gaiety* to witness a hideous drama in
all its loathsome and disgusting details?
In this ease the actor and the journalist are
travelling in the same path, but the journalist
runs amuck at the actor because lie wants the
path all to himself. His position is identically
lit of the individual regarding whom a homely
et wro.e :
1 At everyone who went by that road
A stick or a stone that old cove throwed,
ALd venever he threw his stick or his stone
He raised up a cry of * Let me alone!'
‘ Let me alone, for I loves to shy
Them bits cf things at the passers-by.
I'm a quiet old cove,' he d say with a groan,
‘ All I axes is that you let me alone.'"
ie Bcli.etin has a right to denounce Mr.
ivian’s blood stained realism, for it has always
aintained th> gallows to be a curse and a dis-
■ace, whether in the gaol-yard or on the stage,
rie Echo, hi wove', can only throw its stick and
5 stone at the actor, because he has borrowed
3 gallows, and intruded on its private road to
irdition, and its cry is, therefore, “ Let me alor.e!”
er, when the dramatist desires to show the
inrse of retributive justice what would tho
cho have him do ? He cannot crucify his vie-
m in Homan fashion, or £ mother him with
shes in the old Persian style, or impale him after
ie manner of Belesis and Tiglath-Pileper, or
reak him on the whtel as the good old German
mperors did their victims; all these modes
ould outrage the probabilities and expose him to
jntempt. If lie insists on depicting crime and
s punishment he mast follow the customs of the
ay. The Echo ha 3 helped to build the gallows ;
:t it stand by and admire its work.
The Etiquette of Flogging.
he Brisbane Telegraph has built a new
hudder in the realms of journalism by its late
ssay on the etiquette of floggiDg. It is a parson-
idden sheet with a profound regard for vested
atereots of all kinds, and ihis is the way it cislo-
ates itself over one of the most atrocious and dis-
raceful perversions of law ever known under
leaven :
•' Not a word was uttered by Norton during the whole
roceedings, and when lie was unstrapped and removed from
he triangle his conduct icasjvst as it should have been ■
Ve admire that sentence. If 10,000 cretins,
Irunkards, morphia-fiends, and incurable maniacs
lad worked ceaselessly since the commencement
>( the Christian era they could Ii xrdly have
ivolved anything more striking. H ■ conduct
oas just as it should have been." T ere is an
itiquetto and a conventionalism, then, even in
loggirg. A man who is stripped to the waist and
triced up in order that the skin may be cut from
lis back in ragged strips, should never forget his
Jhesterfieldinn courtesy even in that exciting
juarter-o’-an hour, and however important tho
mbject under dheussion may teem, he must not
make rem ,rks that are unfit for Sunday-school.
We arv not in'oimed whence that cold blooded
gospel-frog, the Telegraph writer, culled his
words of wisdom on this subject, but we aro pre-
pared to admit that if he had been flogged himself
even unto seventy times seven, he crald not have
better explained the situation. But the individual
who was ■“ whaled ” amid this atmosphere of high-
toned courtesy—this piiioner who was tied up and
took his skinning like a gentleman instead of like
a wild beast, was entitled to a little sympathy
on other grounds. He was working out a sentence
of 14 months’ imprisonment ; he was set to labour
outside the gaol ; and then he yielded to an irre-
sistible love of litKiiy- that love of libcrly which
at least under alio her circumstance i 3 the loftiest
and noble3t sentiment implanted in tho breast of
man-and made his eserpe. He was brought
back, however, by a warder, who said he had
been'kicked by North k in the struggle which
preceded his capture. The ease was also said to
have been afterwards tr ed by two justices, but
ai the proceedings were strictly private there is
nothing to prove that it was tried at all, and the
prisoner was ordered to receive 25 lashes which
he look—let us once more mouth that memorable
srntciice ’* just as he should ha.ve done.
Years ago a Chief Justice of Queens-
land pointed out that escaping from cus-
tody was not a crime, there bsiDg no statute
aga’nst it, so the punishment was awarded under
a gaol regulation which allows cf the cat as a
penalty for assaulting a warder in the prison.
Norton, as it happened, assaulted him outside, so
the regulation was of no effect, and the decision
of the two justices was a disgraceful and ap-
parently illegal act, but that doesn't seem to matter
much in the old convict-ridden city of Brisbane.
The code law of Queensland recognises that if gaol
officials, by negligence and bull-headed stupidity,
allow eonttnees a chance to escape, the latter have a
right to avail themselves of it in obedience to the
noblest instincts with which God has endowed
mankind ; but, unluckily, the same code hands
the prisoner over to the tender mercies of these
same gaol ofticia’s, with their triangles, their
scourger, and their cat. On a similar principle, we
presume, if Norton had killed the warder—or,
perhaps, if the warder had said that he had been
killed—the escapee would have been hanged by
the same irresponsible tribunal, and the Brisbane
Telegraph would have testified that the attitude
of the obliging and gentlemanly corpse was “just
as it should have been.” That parson-trodden
journal seems to be satisfied all round —with the
two unaccountable beaks for ordering the punish-
ment, and the hangman for administering it, and
the prisoner for taking his allowance with such
refined dignity :
For tl ey were light to so decree,
And you were right,
And I was right,
And all was light as right can be.
It is a blessed thing to be contented—even when
the subject for contentment is another man’s
fioggiDg.
A Nowtown Outrage.
The offence recently committed at Newtown
must be described as heinous in a high degree.
The offenders are the police and the stipendary
magistrates offic'ating at that place. A woman
of notoriously disreputable character charged a
number of men with having criminally assaulted
her. She allowed over a week to elapse after the
crime was alleged to have been perpetrated before
making a complaint. Her story on the face of it
was evidontly a pure fabrication. Nobody be-
lieved a word of it from the first. Yet the ac-
cused men, to the number of six, were arrested,
detained several days in prison, and then brought
before a magistrate and reirandcd for a week
without a tittle of evidence being adduced. Nor
is this all. On the prisoners being ar-
raigned a second time, a further remand
for four days was granted, again without
taking any evidence. Finally, when the
police did condescend to go on with the charge,
the case at once broke down by reason cf its own
inherent rottenness, and the defendants were dis-
charged from custody. For about a fortnight
these men, while p:rf«ctly innocent of the in-
famous crime attributed to them, were incarce-
rated at the request of policemen who, if they did
not know they were assisting to bolster up a false
charge, assuredly must be condemned as fools.
The conduct of the police in this matter calls for
careful investigation at the hands of the Govern-
ment. As for the conduct of the bench, that
seems to require that an example should be made
of the functionaries responsible. The stipendiary
magistrates are in the habit of “ supporting the
police” in an wholly unwarrantable style. The
way in which remands are granted cn the simple
application of constables is monstrous, and would
not be tolerated for a moment in any community
save Sydney. The present instance is too glarir g
a piece of maladministration, however, to be
passed over even by the Sydney public and a
Sydney Government. If the latter fail to call
these n ugistrates to account, surely the former
will not neglect to remember the dereliction of
duty. If Parliament were sitting, no doubt the
case would be made the basis of an interpellation
with a view of securing the iDflict : on of proper
punishment cn the officials concerned in this out-
rage upon the administration of justice. But the
Government should need no spurring on from
Parliament where the underlying right of citizens
accused of a crime to have the charge investi-
gated without a moment's unnecessary delay has
been thus flagrantly violated by well-paid and
ostensibly not ignorant functionaries.
Another New South Wales railway fraud has
I been discovered, and, marvellous to iclate, it is the
Department itself that has “ sprurg ” the swindle
this time. And, by a strange coincidence, it was
the said Department that was unconsciously work-
ing the swindle also. From the evidence before
the Court it seems that whenever a new truck is
purchased it is at once weighed and the weight is
legibly painted on either side, so that the “ tare ’
can be easily ascertained. These trucks are built,
at the start, of Oregon or some light timber, and
in course of time repairs become necessary. Those
repairs are often considerable, and hardwood
being used for them, the trucks, after a couple of
visits to the repaiier’s shop, soon come to weigh
nearly twice as much as they did at first. Some
astute official (who will probably he disrated for
his trouble) found this out and reported it, the
result being that every truck is now being
weighod afresh. In some instances a difference
of nearly a ton between the actual and the marked
weight has teen discovered, and farmers, wood-
men, and the like are now beginning to under-
stand how it was that two trucks, which ap-
parently conUined the same quantity of stuff,
should differ so mysteriously in weight. No
arrests have been made —excep' in the manu-
facture of light-timbered trucks.
Perhaps the most cutiously-mixed case ever
heard in a police court was that of the Cornish
farmer against the local preacher in Melbourne
last week. The Cornish farmer was God-fearing
and pious, albeit he was living with “a strange
woman.” This is the first anomaly ; the next is
that he had £5OOO in the bank, and yet went to
work in a quarry at Bs. a day. Both statements
arc absolutely true, however inconsistent they
may seem. The next episode in the narrative is
more intelligible. The farmer was staying at the
Victoria Coffee Palace, Smyth also. They were
both waikintr through the hall, and were simul-
taneously stocked by the sight of men playing
cards. It was Sunday evening. They exchanged
look 3 and words and shortly after purses. The
preacher went through the farmer like a knife,
hut in marvellously clean aid artistic fashion.
First he plumbed the farmer’s pocket, then with-
out admitting any testing-rod, disclosed the capa-
city of his own. He was a man worth £ll,OOO,
hut had so overmasterieg a call to’ religion
that he permitted his capital to lie loosely around
and received Gon as the interest. He was going
to put £2OOO out to interest in Sydney at 8 per
cent,, a heavy rate which he had scruples about
taking, but it would all go in God’s service.
Amen, said the farmer, and a week passed. Then
said the preacher in a casual manner. ” 1 do not
think I can take up that investment in Sydney—
would your conscience permit you to take 8 per
cent 2 ” Farmer—we are now giving his
story—strained his conscience to the re-
quired extent, and drew a cheque for the preacher
to invest as desired. Then they prayed together,
and went to chapel together, and rebuked the un-
holy card-players, and by-and-bye the preacher
took a wood and coal business and sent the farmer
out to manage it, and all things went nicely
enough till “ the strange woman” discovered that
her farmer’s bank account was reduced by £3700,
and that the preacher wasn’t round as often as he
usod to be. Then the man who had been working the
steam-saw in the yard and striking the drill in the
quarry wished that he had all his tools together
and the body of the preacher at his disposal for
half-an-hour. The police got the preacher last
week, and this week Mr. J. L. Purves is dilig-
ently engaged in proving that all the moneys the
farmer paid over were for services rendered or as
subscriptions to established philanthropic funds ;
and the chances are that the farmer will work in
the yard in future and the “strange woman”
write all cheques, while the preacher will take a
run round the world, looking out for farmers in
every port, and thanking Goi> for making good
barristers and saving poor preachers from the u i -
righteous orgies of the wicked.
If Parkes, after travelling so long on his hair,
cares now to travel on something useful instead, h'o
might invite his followers to hold a solemn gabble
over the mining laws of New South Wales. Half
thegcldfields of the colony are now of service only a 3
’possum-roosts because of the vast areas held by
“companies” andother swindles —areas on which no
work is done, or ever will be done, until a chance
is found to sell the property at a high figure to
one of those fools who go about at times of ex-
citement howling to be taken in. The working
miner prospects for the present generation of
haughty loafers, and a aristocracy is
gradually rising in the colony, whose claim to dis-
tinction will one day rest on the fact that their
ancestors have shepherded the same claim for so
many centuries. If gold syndicates holding, eay,
12 men’s ground were compelled to keep six men
constantly employed, under pain of forfeiture, and
so on in proportion, there would be a boom in New
South Wales mining such as has not bem known
for a goed many years. The present method is
about as sensible as would be a system of leasing
out the atmosphere in chunks to be held for sale
at a high figure on some future day when the
whole human race is choking.

Hon. J. White’s horses at Flemington ar

statement that Trident goes very short in hi

Geelong Racing Club had fine weathe
for their summer meeting last week. The Caul
field-trained mare, Camerine, was successful
without an effort, in winning the Cup, her im
mediate attendants being Sheet Anchor, Impulse
and the very much in-and-out, or else rank duffer
Recall. The ever popular Mick O Brien rode the
little mare, and thus had his revenge on Martin
LaughliD, who, at Caulfleid, a few days pre
viously had O'Brien before the stewards for strik
ing his horse Britisher over the head in the race
for the Victorian Club Cup. O’Brien unreservedlj
aimitted thathe had struck the horse—
— and apologised to Fallon directly they pulled up
This, however, was not sufficient for Longhlin
who insisted that O’Brien should be brought up
before the stewards ; they dismissed the case after
30 seconds’ sittmg. The Geelong Club takes the
cake for blindly permitting the most diabolica
swindles to pass unnoticed. The events operate!
upon were the two selling races, in which almost
the whole of the competitor s were “ dead to the
world ” Bookmakers and the oldest of racing
men were heard to state that during the whole oi
their experience such barefaced proceedings had
never previously come under their notice. Mr J.
Harper, the owner of Phoebe Walton, winner of
the first selling event, was unaware that nearly
everything was “ stiffened ” but his filly, and he did
not fail to let those present in the enclosure know
it either. However, she won, but it would have
served the undertakers rightly had she run inside
a post. It has been done cn many occasions.
The motion respecting six-ball overs which
was brought before the Victorian Cricket Associa-
tion at its last meeting, is to be made an inter-
colonial question later on. l’he change must
come, and the sooner it come 3 the better. An
extra two balls will suit alike bowlers “ on the
spot,” and batsmen “on the ball,” making the
game faster either way.
Major Wardill, who took charge of “ Our
Boys ” in England appears to have benefited by
the trip. Playing for Victorian Artillery v.
Infantry the gallant warrior made top score for his
side in a style which was a happy coxibina* ion of
Grace and Shrewsbury. Major Wardrop (sugges-
tive name !) totted up 50 runs for the Infantry, so
between them the Majors did the major portion
of the work. This joke is quite new.

No previous intercolonial cricket match
between Victoria and NSW. has been marked by
such “ sick ” cricket as the one just decided in
favour of N.S.W. In the second innings of the
Victorians the board showed five wickets for five
runs. But for the sturdy opposition of M’Shane and
Worrall the extraordinarily small score of nine
runs made by the Marylebone team against the
first Australian Eleven would have been cast into
the shade. It looked as if the whole team would
not get 10 runs.
* * *
The victory of N.S.W. was mainly due to
the superb bowling of Ferris and Turner. The
Victorian batsmen could not look at the young
left-hander. His “ break ” from leg to the off was
a caution. The way he sticks up the veteran
Blackham, notably a good batsman on a sticky
wicket, was most amusing. He morally bowled
him half-a-dozen times before the batsman retired
“ 1.b.w.” Blackham says Ferris is the best bowler
in the world. Phillips, the Victorian umpire,
gave it as his opinion that the English Eleven does
not embrace two such splendid bowlers as Turner
and Ferris. Tableau : Retire Spofforth and Evans.
Enter Turner and Ferris.

What a fizzle was Mr. Andrew Towns’
annual yearling sale 1 Are the low prices realised
indicative of the badness of the times, or to the
fact that buyers considered it hopeless to compete
with the Hon Jas. White, who seems to have a
lien upon all the classic events in both colonies ?
Mr. White was not among the buyers. He is
breeding largely himself. 'Hie bloodstock as far
as size and appearance went, were much inferior to
those offered at former sales at Hobartville, and the
form shown by many of the high-priced youngsters
sold last year was of such a disappointing charac-
ter as to frighten a good few believers in running
blood. The outcome of the sa'e must have been
» decided loss to the enterprising squire of Hobart-

Sydney, is the luckiest man in Australia. The
first two pounds he sent down drew him the
winner and second of Tattersall’s sweep. A
second time he drew the winner, and has never
subscribed to the consultation without drawing a
horse. But that’s nothing. At the recent S.T.C.
races he backed five winners, and, great Scott! he
backed Soldier’s Wind for the Handicap. What
a mozzle!

The Janet and Waitangi made a splendid
contest of the ten tons and over yacht race at the
National RCgatta, but it was really pitiable to see
the erstwhile champion, the Magic, jogging along
like an old tub in the rear. That the old boat was
too much by the head there cannot be great doubt,
and the writer is still of opinion that the Magic
in o her hands could be brought out to beat the
Waitangi.

“Bill” Slaven, brother of the “coming
champion,” was the first to face the music at
Foley’s on Saturday night with Snow, who at
times landed him rather heavily, although asked
by Slaven to play light. Burgess and Fuller had a
slashing four rounds, the latter getting all over
Burgess with scarcely a return. Mulholland
showed his tremendous hitting power on a gentle-
man from Wollongong whom he knocked out in a
round and a half with a slashing right-hander on
the point of the jaw. Mulholland says he is
anxious to meet Jack Hall, but should he do so
he will find John a remarkably different man to
the run of cattle he has been facing lately. Hall
is a tricky and hard-hitting fighter, and Mulhol-
land’s “boring-in” tactics should suit him to a
nicety. We have heard of some strange “ crosses ’’
amongst the boxers, but perhaps the strangest was
that acknowledged by Williams, a coloured man,
on Saturday night. He stated that Nixon, his
opponent, had promised net to hit him in the face,
but if this was true, then Nixon put the “double
cross ” on him ; anyhow, he brought the claret
pretty freely.

a 20-mile race, and the third run-off was only won
by a yard.

“Man overboard!” was heard at least
twire on the N.S.W. National Regatta day. The
Sao lost a lot of time in picking her man up, and
the Dreamland nearly came to grief when her man
went. The tiller broke, and Doran, who was in
charge of the pickhandle, went plump into the
water, the boat running up into the wind and
nearly filling. The Aileen was close up, but it is
stated she went on her course and left Doran to
his chance of being takem down by his wet clothes
or a shark until the Carlotta’s crew picked him up
and placed him on his boat. The Aileen’s skipper,
however, did not gain anything by his alleged
Levitical conduct, as the Carlotta passed him com-
ing home, and won without her time-allowance.
It would bs well for regatta committees to lay
down a law that any boat passing a man or boat
in distress shall be disqualified.
The decisive victory of the Auckland-built
yacht Waitangi has caused rejoicing among the
inhabitants of the city on the pleasant waters of
the Waitemata. WaitaDgi—“ weeping water
is the name of a river in the Bay of
Islands locality, and on its banks the
celebrated treaty beariDg its name was
signed. The late Judge Maning
(“ Pakeha Maori ”) of the N.Z. native
land court, gives a most graphic
account of the signing of the treaty in
hii “Tale of the War in the North."
Largesse, in the shape of food and
clothing, was freely bestowed by the
British representatives on the natives
assembled to sign away their indepen-
dence by the side of the “weeping
water.” The innooent-minded Maori
naturally became possessed of the idea
that the raiment and eatables were pay-
ment for his signature, and hastened to
put down his name that he might
quickly share the good things going.
If ever a treaty was made to be torn up,
that treaty was the treaty of Waitangi.

Prior to the start for the January Handi-
cap at Elsternwick Park, an owner enquired of a
bookmaker what he was betting on. “I’m a

owner’s reply ; “and you are a blanked fool to

Bookie gave a negative answer. “ Well, said

The five-style wrestle between Cannon
and Donald Dinnie, brought off a week earlier
than was originally intended, resulted in a square
win for the younger man. Dinnie won the collar-and •
elbow and side-hold by the aid of his remarkable
legs, while Cannon downed the braw if cot in
catch-as-catch-can, Cumberland, and Grrnco-
Roman. The catch-as-catch-can bout contrary to
expectation, was the shortest and liveliest of the
evening. Cannon had his man fairly round the
waist in two or three minutes, and flung him in
the good old-fashioned schoolboy style. In a
general way, catch-as catch-can resolves itself
into Grieco-Roman pure and simple. The impres-
sion carried away by spectators (who tilled all
parts of the Melbourne Bijou Theatre, bar dress-
circle) was that Dinnie succumbed to Father Time
and that Cannon is a good deal below the form of
poor Clarence Whistler. A match bet ween him and
Connor would be worth seeing.

SUNDRY
SHOWS
That godless individual who wears the
outward garb of man has had a bad time in the
Sydney theatres this week. When the rain kept
coming down in drops as large as a shilling, and
some of them as large as Is. the places of
amusement were like Turkish baths, and now by
way of variety, they are hot and parched like a
dry north wind blowing across a salt desert. The
too solid flesh of The Bul'e>in representative
has been melting from his bones, and he has on
more than one occasion been compelled to swab
himself up with blotting paper. As regards the
shows themselves, though they hardly belong to
the domain of the Higher Cultchaw, they are le-s
murderous than usual, and are not calculated to
sow wild oats on the human reputation. They are
attractive but not desperately so, and as they are
mostly known by heart the auditor does not re-
quire to organise himself into a committee of two
fools and a lunatic with power to add to their
stupidity, and examine the managers on oath to
find out what they are all about.

“Lady Audley's Secret” has been per-
mitted, by a blessed dispense* ion of Providence,
to take the place of “East Lynne” at Sydney
Royal Standard. It makes a tolerably good
drama, but the moral is turned upside down with
its feet sticking up in the air, and for this reason
we would love to smite the author with a shark’s-
tooth club, and spread her cerebral matter over
the footlights. Her heroine is a pretty and in-
teresting girl, with a drunken father and an in-
sane mother, and this lady gave her heart in early
life to a fellow with an oiled head and a corpsy
c nnplexion who promised to be her guide and
guardian thenceforth and for ever. There was a
brief honeymoon era of plenty, and then the
deceiver informed her that he would have to
scavenge, or bowl a cat’s meat barrow for a living,
and drew a pretty picture of life in a back court
paved with deceased dogs and such, where they
would bill and coo in clumping boots and cor-
duroys, and seated on a brick apiece instead of a
sofa. At the end of this vista of life the swindled
wife saw herself, a wrinkled, dried-up old hag,
mumbling over a cheap pork-sausage for her Sun-
day dinner, and in her (le -pair and misery bhe
uttered some plain English to the wind-galled
child of wrath who had brought her to this pass,
whereupon that insolvent thief fled to India and
left her penniless. Naturally enough, in the
course of a few years, she coacluded that he must
be dead. If Providence was capable of hitting
anything smaller than a desert any woman would
take it for granted that this degraded gorilla
would have been btruck down by lightning, and a
whole lunatic asylum hired to pile hyaena skulls on
his grave as-a suitable monument. Consequently
she married again, and then to her immeasurable
disgust her rampant lord and master turned up
once more.
He had not improved in his exile. He
was mean enough tow to cajole a guileless hog in
the hope cf being allowed to borrow its dinner,
and after the lady had tried in vain to bla .t some
shred of kindness out of his doggy little sou), she
threw the shrieking brute down a well. We would
have liked to throw him down 20 wells, and then
to have hauled up his wretched carcase a dozen
times over out of pure malignity and thrown mud
on it and dropped the hashed goblin down again,
and asked him if his mother knew he was out,
and our only regret would have been that we had
gone and polluted the well. From this point,
however, the lady was haunted by a fiendish pub-
lican who exacted hush-money, and a friend of
the departed who smoked in her "boudoir and
made allusions every now and then to the gallows,
and when in her despair Bhe set .these two ruffians
on fire we felt it served them right. But in
another moment a fishy-eyed mule clove his way
through the flames dragging the publican after
him ; the pair were saved, and their unhappy
victim committed suicide in her helplessness and
despair. And at the last moment her husband
turned up for the thiid time like an evil spirit
rising out of a bog ; the miserable burlesque on a
humsn being had been fished out of the well, and
had been going about with a broken skull and a
porous plaster on his back ever since. This
arrangement is called poetic justice, but it seems
to us that the torpid old slab who was so mys-
teriously resurrected should have either been
thrown down the well again or sentenced to
snovel mud for 47 years. Nothing less would
have met his case. His part was filled by Mr.
Boothman, while Mr. Dampier took the character
of Robert Audley, and exerted all his talent in
making a success out of that thankless and venge-
ful lout. The interest of the piece, however,
centred in Lady Audley, who w r as represented
by Miss Dampier. She looked and acted the part
well throughout, but the theatre would fill better
if she would come down the chimney armed with
a log and brain her persecutor,; in the hour of
their triumph

The ever popular “Bohemian Girl” is a
success at Sydney Criterion, It commences ant'd
a lurid pomp of crimson rocks which ought to go
at least 2oz. to the ton, and behind these is the
splintered cld pine forest where the Count’s rude
forefathers are supposed to sleep. The after
scenes in Presburg show some ancient and badly
dra'ned but very picturesque city property
which ought to command a good rental, and the
view of the Count’s mansion convinces us that
Arline is not blowing when she speaks of dwelling
in “marble halls.” Signor Verdi has the part of
Count Arnheim, a character who is evidently
meant to be attractive, though his exasperatirg
dulness would justify a scavenger in snubbing
him on a very short acquaintance. No one but a
born fool who has been brought up to speak the
most crackjaw language known in Central Europe
would stand braying prayers when he knows his
little daughter is being stolen; a rational being
would hire a Chinaman to do the praying for him
while he piled his benighted intellect on top of a
horse and went off in hot pursuit, and though
Signor Verdi poked the slow old animal into a
certain amount of melodious activity, he couldn’t
redeem him from the suspicion of being the very
last possibility in the way of an ass. Mr. Forde
made a spry and amusing blackguard out of
Devilshoof, and dodged within three feet of the
Count while the latter was conducting divine ser-
vice ; and Mr. Beaumont as Thaddeus achieved a
success He was not our beau ideal of a Polish
patriot, for those whom we have known were all
artists who reeked of bad tobacco ; they suffered
very much, too, from scars on the legs which they
always declared were caused by whole kegs of
bullets shot into them by the Tartar liar who
bosses their native land; but Mr. Beaumont, de-
spite the want of bullets, tobacoo-reek, and scars,
was an attractive object, and his rendering of
“ The Fair Land of Poland ” was worth hearing.
Miss Colbourne-Baber made a lovely
Arline She looked as fresh as an angel in a
shower bath, and her rippling song flowed forth
like curses from our head compositor when the
longed-for screed is not forthcoming. Miss Fanny
Liddiard had the thankless part of the Gipsy
Queen, a character which we are inclined to think
was modelled from the author’s fierce old mother-
in-law; and Florenstein, under the fostering care of
Mr. Johnston, became a seething ocean of comic
stupidity. Something really ought to be done
with Florenstein.

Minnie Palmer’s last week at Sydney
Opera House is being signalised by the tears of a
mashed and stage-struck city. A good many in-
dividuals who look as if they had never before
entered a theatre in their lives
sneak in to have a look, under pre-
tence that they thought the place
was a church, but as the perform-
ance goes on each meek looking
Wesleyan cuss absent-mindedly
drops the bundle of tracts which
he was flattening against his nar-
row chest and applauds like an
ordinary sinner. On February 7
the uncrushable George Darrell
comes along with an entirely
original Australian drama. Is
it we or our fathers who have
sinned that this should come upon
us ?

That great horsey drama,
“ The Flying Scudd,” continues to
meet with a certain amount of
success at Sydney Gaiety, and
i.i judiciously supported by many
sciatic old baldheads, who are ob-
viously charmed at the way the
wicked captain waits and wobbles
for the virtuous heroine. This
scaly customer and the horse keep
the play going. Without them
even Mo Davis’s lurid nose would
fall flat, and considering its pre-
sent sharpness and the way it
pokes into other people’s business,
that is saying a good deal.

The Buffalo Minstrels have
now taken possession of Sydney
Academy. Their show has im-
proved considerably since their last
visit and a little scenery helps it out.
According to the bill their company
consists of 35 artists, but in spite
of the most vigorous and vocifer-
ous counting we could not lift the
number above 12. Some of the
items are new and some are as old
as Parkes’ hair, but the perform-
ance goes pretty smoothly and the
house fills well. No human being
could well ask more than that.

The “ Theatre of Varieties ” at Newtown,
Sydney, opened on Anniversary night, when a
whole mass of talent appeared before a tolerably
clean-faced audience. (N. B.—lt had been rain-

highly-decorated structure, and among the artists
were some whom we hope to see again, and many
whom we will never see again if we can help it.
The audience, however, appeared to be pretty
well pleased; perhaps they didn’t know any
better.

In Melbourne several managers have been '
fined for allowing their theatres to become over-
crowded, and with fiendish sarcasm they ask why
the police don’t look after the churches as well
and stop the frenzied crush there. In this respect
the bobbies certainly neglect their duty. We
have ourselves seen a church so disgracefully
overcrowded that a man was compelled to uleep
sitting up—there was no room to stretch himself —
and many places of worship are in a dilapidated
state and have no decent bar attached.

is proprietor of the Hoffmann House, and it will be remem-
bered that when Lord Lonsdale and his fair charge put up at

The Queen, in order to mark her womanly
sympathy with the poor and starving, will en-
gage all London theatres for a “Jubilee” week
and throw them open to the public. This arrange-
ment will be distasteful to the half-dozen or so
managers whose shows draw full houses on their
merits, but the rest of them will regard it as a
godsend. Every theatre will be paid for, pre-
sumably, according to its licensed seating capacity
at list prices ; there will be no deadheads, for even
the newspaper men (who are sure to get in before
time and jump the private boxes) will be charged
in the bill to their Sovereign Lady. When we re-
member that Drury Lane comfortably holds about
£540 per night, the thought occurs to us that the
royal “ greed” might be laid out in something
more filling at the price than this dramatic fare.
A man who hasn’t tasted food for 48 hours
can’t satisfy the pangs of hunger with an
opera bovffe, nor is such a play as
. “ Money ” likely to soothe the minds of those
who haven’t got any. But this is the sort of
tinsel benevolence with which kings and queens
have courted popularly ever since crowns were
invented. The unthinking mob, doing the theatre
on the cheap, will encore the National Anthem
and “ God Bless the Prince of Wales,” while the
dailies duly gush over these “outbursts of
loyalty.” Meanwhile, with the exception of a few
shaky theatrical managers, who stick up “stand-
ing room only ’ for the first time in their lives,
nobody will be any the better off. The same
dodge was practised on the night of the Queen’s
cjroxation, and the story is told of an old lady
protesting against an operatic “trio,” on the
ground that the artists were imposing on the
Queen’s kindness by singing all together, instead
of one at a time. But we believe this story par-
takes of the character of a lie.

The Lonsdale-Cameron Opera Company
burst up ingloriously, the peer and his partner—
we mean, of course, “business-partner”—being
compelled to compound with the company for the
immediate termination of their engagements. We
really pity Lonsdale. He has declared that his
only object in organising the company was a
desire to make money, and instead of raking in
dollars he has lost very heavily. He may yet find
that there is more money to be made out cf
curates than cantatrices, and more solid profit in
his 41 church livings than in 241 opera companies.

-“ Reliable authority ” asserts that Gilbert
and Sullivan’s new comic opera relates to the time
of George 111., and has for its chief characters two
noble brothers, the last descendants of a family
distinguished for assorted atrocities. Their
estates are held on condition that they live up to
the family reputation, and the elder of the two,
feeling a distaste for such performances, runs
away and mashes a village maiden. This is only
the fiftieth time we have had the plot of this piece
described upon “reliable authority.” Good ex-
cuse for an ad., doncherknow Sydney play-
goers will regret to hear that Miss Nelly Monta-
gue (Mrs. W. Andrews) is lying ill in Mel-
bourne of paralysis. It is doubtful whether she
will regain the use of her right arm......
We regret to hear that Signor Pietro Luisetti has
died at Christchurch, N Z., leaving his wife and
five children but poorly provided for. Luisetti, who
was well-born, was an accomplished musician and
a gallant gentleman who bravely faced terrible
misfortunes....l.M’Mahon and Leitch’s New Zea-
land tour was, we hear, most successful. The
lucky pair have accepted invitations to spend a
few weeks at the Bay of Islands and in Fiji
Dur edin papers have fallen in love with G W.
Anson’s impersonation of Mr. Poskett.
“ If they took Sir Henry Parkes name
out of the statute book of the colony it remained
a blank,” said Mr. Garland, at Carcoar. (Tremen-
dous applause). After all the statute book would
look better as a blank than as a smudge.
Sir Henry Parkes, in his St. Leonard’s
address, spoke of “ that strange, curious-looking
creature, Mr. Luscombe.’ Luscombe effectually
retorts by satirically challenging Parkes to shave
his beard and let people have a look at his moutjh.
This is a queer world.
N.S.W. has spent about £200,000 a year
in assisted immigration. In 1884, 7000 people were
brought out, but so many of these were forced to
take refuge in Protectionist Victoria that N.S.W.
got only 184 more than the sister colony as the net
result of her outlay. 184 people for £200,000 !
Mr. M‘Millan, the East Sydney aspirant,
has found a new reason for the N.S.W. deficit.
“ Its cause,” he says, “ is a certain want of moral
tone throughout all the institutions of the
country.” Isn’t that queer, now ? We have .all
along been thinking that it had someth'ng to do
with revenue and expenditure.
“ Never mind what Mr. Abigail is per-
sonally,” said Sir ’Enry in the course of Ms famous
apology for his colleagues, “ he is -a man of large
and fast developing mental capacity.” This is
very good in point of theory, but wouldn’t it be as
well to get a man whose mind is already full
grown ? Goodness knows how much he may cos.t
the country for mental grub while he is growing.
The Freetrade party are already preparing
a policy in view of the time when they are to hold
the reins of power. Mr. Wise, President of the
Free-trade Associ <tion, says : “ I will advocate a
measure for the better housing of the poor. ” If
Free-trade triumphs there will be a lot of poor and
they’ll want housing tadly. We hope to see Mr.
Wise get in. He is a statesman who looks ahead.

Mrs. T. P. Hill, a lady who gives “reci
tals ” (under superior patronage) and drops into
poetry in the penny papers, lias found a grievance
Mrs. H. is naturally anxious to put a little thing
of her own upon the tombstone of her late son
but the secretary of the Melbourne Cemetery
Trustees has rejected the gem in question as
heathenish nonsense.” Thereupon the indig
nant lady “ invites the opinion of Christian ant
literary men ” on her latest —
‘ ‘ Whom the gods love die early,
Our Father knoweth best,
And it is wrong to murmur
At his high behest,
Sleep gently blighted blossom.
Sleep and take thy re3t.”
As an old established Christian and literary man
we must point out to Mrs. Hill that there are
Deities and deities. She seems to have mixed
’em, and that’s what worries the secretary. This
will placate the monster —
When the gods admire a creeter,
Then they take him straight—
Take him up to see St. Peter
At the Golden Gate —
Turn his gas off at the meter
Early —(Name and date),
or this is a Christian pome without any nonsense
about it—
Alfred Brandon Hill,
Death presents his bill,
And the debt of Nature must be paid ;
Blossoms bees have suck’t
Wither and are pluck’t—
Children in their little graves are laid.
Three score j ests and ten
rave a lot of thou—
Such are not the chosen of the gods.
Early called, or late,
Quarrel not with fate —
When, or why, we wither makes no odds.
“ Bodies of men attended the churches at
Battersea, St. Pancras, and Bermondsey, and
hissed the prayers for the Queen.” —
Hiss the prayers for the Queen —
What a shocking story !
To vent their lawless spleen
On their Sovereign Victoree 1
Clear it appears to us
Times must be disjointed,
When men like this presume to hiss
Tho name of God’s Anointed.
But perhaps there’s some mistake—
What seemed like sibi lation
Was intended for to make
A loyal demon-stration ;
For we cannot well believe
That Socialists (tho’ shady),
Could have the cheek last Sunday week
To hiss a Royal Lady.
Yet if it should be true,
This very shocking story,
It proves the dif. anew
’Twixt Radical and Tory ;
In this year of Jubilee,
When Tories would be kissing
The royal toe, these Rads., you know,
The royal name are hissing.
A few drops of slush squeezed from the
“ London correspondence ” of the Argus : —“ The
fact is, the Prince of Wales has inherited from his
father a love of bard work, which makes the cate
and idleness of English Royal life very distasteful
to him. He seems ever restless in seeking and
finding fresh work for his hands, while his brothers
have congenial occupation in their professions.”
Let us burst into a hymn of praise—
The nimble Bertie, in the purple horn,
Abhors a life of idleness and ease ;
He's up and doing at the streak of dawn,
And sniffs the fragrance of the morning breeze;
When the wee, witching hours of night are sped
He rises—from his chair, and goes to bed.
His restless Highness ever seems to seek
Fresh occupation to beguile the day
And night—the theatre twice a week,
After the theatre, possibly the play ;
And, chief among his most athletic feats,
Consider all the many times he eats—
The morning calls on interesting friends,
The “ taking chair” at regulation feeds ;
Ye gods ! How many hours Ilis Highness spends
In stern accomplishment of doughty deeds
Here, there, in half-a-dozen places—
Ball, garden party, soiree, or the Races.
Denied the solace of congenial toil—
Like Sailor Alfred, or the bold Connaught;
Bert, keeps bis kettle always on the boil,
And scorns to squander useful time in thought;
The round of labour never seems to cease—
His duties with his waistcoat girth increase.
Oh, happy land! rejoicing in a Prince
Who stands upon a pedestal alone.
The world has never seen his equal since
Great-uncle George was Regent on the throne ;
We would continue, but that language fails
Hip, hip, hooroo ! God bless the Prince of Wales!

It was one sultry night in Melbourne about
a fortnight ago. The water had been turned off
for about 36 hours, and luxurious people who
wanted to wash themselves had to do it in the
manner permitted by the Prophet when water is
scarce —that is to say, with sand —or go about in
an armour-plating of dirt. The writer live 3 in a
quiet street in a quiet suburb. Opposite him
dwellsanoisy Hebrew-miscreant whohasa continual
thirst you could heat a flat-iron at. He never
comes home till the last hotel is shut, and then he
sits on the verandah with a two-gallon jug of
water between his knees, and curses at large.
Imagine a hippopotamus going for a stroll among
the rice-fields and returning to find the river in
which he lived dried up. If you can you may
arrive at a pallid notion of the way in which that-
chosen lunatic carried on when he came home on
the night in question and found the water turned
off. He tore up and down the verandah the whole
night long, cursing everything from an inch high
to an hour old, and now and then varying the per-
formance with a dismal and hideous bellow. o.:e
by one every window opened and bitter maledic-
tions were hurled at him. It is not too
much to say that, since the days of Gomorrah,
so much, and such varied, blasphemy was never
heard before in a given time in one block cf
houses. A frenzy of profanity seemed to have
seized upon every immortal soul in the terrace.
Highest among the vituperative voices was that of
a preacher, a good man and a pious, who has fre-
quently reproved the writer for using strong lan-
guage. But the son of Shansi across the way
paid no more heed to it all than if it were the
buzzing of gnats. The writer, while this terrific
racket was going on, was calmly writing the
following address to the gnashing Hebrew, and as
soon as there was a lull in the storm, crossed the
street and sang it to him, playing an accordion
the while:—
O, festive He-e-brew!
Thou art not in the Ju-u-den Strasse
Nor in the Ghet-to—so we pray thee pass
On this in-fer-nal riot.
For To o-pheb’s sake ke-e-p qui-et :
For Abra ham’s sake too-oo
We are distressed.
So we beseech thee, O, most noble Jew-ew !
Give us a re3t!
Gi-i-ve us a r-r-est!
0, son of Shaitan !
Why cursest thou ? What have we done tothee ee
That thou dost make the night an agonee-ee ?
O, gentle Jew, we’re not thy debtors ;
We are a peaceful man of let-ters.
Mayhap as well as you-oo
We love our lit-tle jest.
But this is too much —therefore, gentle Jew-co,
Give us a rest!
Gi-i-ve us a r-r-est!
That fetched him. He said no more. He has not
been seen outside the house since. The people in
the street say that it gave him his death-blow—
not the song but the singing.

would hare to take some light stimulant with his
principal meals. He supposed he was one of those

If Sir Julius Vogel’s
two uncertain leg * would
freshen up sufficiently to
car. y him into the golden
realms of the Evenno: c,
before his glory has tinre
to grow dim, his name
would go down to future
ages as that of the one
great Australian who suc-
ceeded in paintirg a whole
colony red at the expense
of an English railway
syndicate. His last grand
coup— or kcop, as some of
his followers call it—has
been to arrange for the
building of the N.Z.
and West Coast railway
on the land-grant prin-
ciple, a million and a half
acres being the bonus
awarded to the sons of the
iron-horse-leech for doing
the job. But somehow
Julius seem 3 to have got
the horse-leech family to
sign a contract without
seeing the land—a fact
which conclusively proves
that the N.Z. Treasurer
does not think with his legs—and when they do
see it the chances are that the syndicate will soon
have rot one solitary hair left on its betrayed
and deluded head. Mo3t cf the affotrnents are
unsuited for pasture, for they are so steep that a
sheep would have to hold on to the grass with its
teeth to avoid sliding into the plains below, and it
is impossible to grow potatoes on them for the
vegetables would fall out of the ground. Where-
ever there is an unusually hungry mountain-peak
the syndicate gets it, and the treasurer seems to
have gone mile 3 out of his way to hunt up bare
rocky patches that look as if they had been
grubbed out of Tophet, and to search out glaciers,
and precipices, and scorched and blasted areas, where
the foul fiend has scraped off every vestige of soil,
and then put an old volcano on top to hold the
territory down. On fully half their property the
members of the syndicate would require to
haDg on to a rope to save their lives, and then
when the rope broke they would go down and
fly through space for a billion years before striking
against the other half. Sir Julius has done his
level best, it must be admitted, to fill up the co m-
pany’s frenzied craving for natural scenery. He
has thrown in every kind of magnificent spectacle
and gorgeous parorama that he could lay hands
on, to say nothing of every description of split and
crack and abyss that rends the surface of this
mortal earth, but this does not seem to be quite
what was bargained for, and the syndicate now
I want Vogel to move the cliffs and chasrrs and
mountains off their land, and let them sea what it
is like.
The truth of this story is vouched for by a
N.S.W. Minister. One Cramp, a country publican,
was nominated for a J.P.-ship, and the larky
phonetic wretch accepted the billet thusly :
“ Dear Sir, This comes hopping it will find you quite well
and I liar grate pleazure in ackceptin the position of Justis
of the Piece, and shall endeiour to coh'.bit kordially with
my brother nagietrats.’’
There was a signature attached like a fried gob-
lin in hysterics. On receipt of this a great effort
was made to shunt Cramp before it was too late,
but, alas ! Cramp had been sworn in, and was al-
ready “ cohabiting." Of course he meant “co-
operate.”
“Town Hall, Prahran. Friendly discus-
sion. ‘ Conditional Immortality.’ Geo. A.
Brown (G.A.8.) affirms; J. P. Peppercorn re-

tality. We would also like to hear the opinions
of a cockroach upon the Copernican system :
Rather, 0, rather, let U 3 be
Wiped out! Rather, much rather, let us drown
In black oblivion, th an that we
Should share our immortality
With Peppercorn and Brown.

Referring to the late annual meeting of

people will not give to the church as a whole, but
only to their particular congregation’s funds, and
this even in jubilee year. ’Tis as if a man cele-
brated his wife’s birthday by buying himself a
new hat.” This is a beautiful and touching speci-
men of the wordings of the childlike heart, as un-
derstood by the religious reporter of the Daily
Telegraph. The Wesleyan Church, after paying
his own particular congregational dues (which
you would think should be enough toeave his own
soul and the soul of at least one benighted nigger

if he does not further 1 ' part ” to the “ church as

In all the marts,
At scooping coin ;hey’d beat you blind —
“These childlike hearts.”
Coin is a good thing, life a span,
Their little dart’s
To pile the coin in while they can—
“ These childiike hearts.”

Freely. He's the saved Wesleyan—

Two “ oldest residents ” of Taripta (Vic.),
Messrs. Tanner ard OShea, returning from the

logical and conclusive. . Without waiting to

BISHOP MOORIIOUSE.
Of Moorhouse, the bishop, we sing,
A song that will ring through the ages;
His name and his mem’ry will cling
Like limpets to History’s pages.
The future for ever will ken
A Bishop so great and so good
Who suffered a martyrdom when
“ Digesting great masses of food.”
He did his devout level best
To abstain from all drinks alcoholic,
Blue ribbon he wore on his breast,
Though it doubled him up with the colic ;
For weeks and for months did he strive
To abstain as a Good Templar should,
But he found himself scarcely alive
“ When digesting great masses of food.”
The spirit was willing to ban
All spirits in wood or in bottle,
But the flesh, that frail portion of man,
Wasn’t game to continue teetotal.
His doctor decided he must
With his grub some light liquor include
(Alcoholic, of course), or he’d bust,
“ When digesting great masses of food.”
“ Long-sleevers " he ne’er could abide,
Nor nips at odd time 3, nor refreshers,
Indulgers in these would be chide
In sermons that thumped them like threshers.
And never, so help him, did he,
That Bishop so holy and good,
Drink wine, ale, or spirits, ye see,
“ Except with great masses of food.”
Oh, Britain, Great Britain, in thee
While Bishops are guzzling and carving,
The poor in their hovels we see,
In millions, repining and starving.
But never let anyone dare
Complain or be ever so rude
As to hint that a bishop should share
With these his ‘ 1 great masses of food, ”
A GOOD WIN FOR GOODWYN.
Ah ! Goodwyn, now we understand
Why you wouldn't cross the water—
Twelve pounds a week in a distant land
Is naught beside the heart and hand
Of a mighty prelate’s daughter.
A Bathurst bishop’s road is rough
Compared with wbat y ou’ll travel ;
E’en though the lady brings no “ stuff,”
Promotion to r> is sure enough—
A billet snug you’ll snavel.
Good Goodwyn, you have chosen well,
We guess you’re more than seven ;
The Bathurst folks may go to H—r-,
While you at home in comfort dwell,
And book a place in Heaven.
The fever is raging in Melbourne town,
As is often its horrible wont,
The strong and the weak are alike stricken down,
Some of ’em die, and some don’t;
The Board, which should tackle such matters as
this,
Is scratching its head in dismay,
For’tis painfu’ly certain there’s something amiss—
The deuce of a dickens to pay.
Microbes and germs are careering abroad,
They are scattered all over the place,
But (like flowers that bloom in the springtime) the
Board
Has notbiDg to do with the case ;
Any evidence touching the wherefore ard why,
To accept it is properly loath,
For a witne3S is certain to tell ’em a lie
If he can’t be examined on oath.
The trouble increases with every hour,
The Boai d is still scratching its head ;
Alas and alack ! bu>' it hasn’t the power
To ask how the fever is spread—
To take evidence touching the wherefore and why
With a view to arresting iis growth;
Oh ! the whole of the people will probably die
Before they’re examined on oath.

Sir Henry Parkes has shunted all the
“private secretaries” of former Ministers. He
should at least have allowed his colleague, Mr.
Abigail, one. It will look so bad ia the Depart-
ment to see “refuse” spelt with two “o’s” and
an “i.”
A Mr. Garrard, writing to an Auckland
paper on the land scheme and the Lands Minister,

In the appointment of Mr. John Suther-
land to the N.S.W. Ministry of Works, a suburban
paper sees the “ direct intervention of Provi-
dence.” This is the v* ry first time we have heard
of the Bennett family being confounded with the
Almighty.
Judge Docker denies that he ever secured
Mudgee Taylor of corruption, and says that all
he told the N.S.W. Attorney-General was that a
witness had sworn in court that Mr. Taylor had
accepted money to procure the release of a con-
victed prisoner.
According to Lord Harris, the Primrose
League, which started in January, ’B5, with G 637
members, had in October, ’B5, 34,205 ; in January,
’B6, it had 102,289 ; in February, ’B6, it had 155,354 ;
in April, ’B6, it had 276,283; and in October, ’B6, it
had 455,865 members.
Happy N.S.W. ! Her Parliament will
low assuredly loose one of the most sottish
of its drunkards. However, there seems to be a
chance that the “ boczsr” who takes next place
on the ladder of glory—he is a person who drinks
about two bottles of spirits daily—will next session
inflict his odious presence on the Home.
The innocent Sydney D.T. affected, not to
see the point of Mr. Tcohey’s dramatic flourish of
a cheque-book at a meeting of his, and talks about
the insolence of flaunting his wealth before the
electors in that fashion. Mr. Toohej’s accompany
ing remark, “I might have been in the present
Ministry had I chosen—cheque-books are very
useful things,” explains the full meaning of his
action.
The easy virtue and extreme accessibility
of the Sydney D.T. is displayed in the fact that
that paper s[ calcs of Mr. Sutherland's “ fussy im-
becility” be 'ause he “ reversed eveiy progressive
al oration determined on by his predecessor”—for
example, the tunning of a morning mail-train
which would admirably serve the intereits of the
morning newspaper proprietors as against those
of Mr. Alfred Bennett.
Henniker Heaton, in a recent speech, at
which Mr. Service was p esent, declared that he
had been assured by several members of the
I French Cabinet that the ex-Premier’s New Heb-
ridean outpourings were causing great indigna-
j tion on the Continent. Great Scott! Fancy dear
old Henniker being on speaking terms with the
French Cabinet! And nobody ever thought he
had got beyond, “ Avez-vous vu le dog de ma

“The State carriage of the dethroned
King Thcebaw of Burmah has been presented to
the Queen. Her Majesty graciously acknowledged
the present.” “ Mary Ann O’Rourke, an old
woman of 74 yeai*3, was yesterday sentenced at
i Bow-street to six months’ imprisonment for re-
ceiving stolen goods valued at 2s. 6d The magis-
trate regretted that crimes of this class so rarely
were detected and punished.” These two items
are from the same issue of one of our English
exchanges.
According to an article in the London
Economist, Freetrade is upending the agricultural
industry of England. The average annual value
of farm products for the 10 y. ars ending 1875 was
£124,000 000, but the next ten years reduced this
average to £105,000,000, and 1885 showed a further
shrinkage to £90,000,000. These figures dovetail
nicely with statistics recently published in The
Bulletin proving the migration of men from the
rural districts to the cities of England. In less
than five years Britain will levy duties on imported
grain, in order to prevent the whole country from
becomieg a picturesque desert.
Behold another twist by the Sydney D.T.
Referring to Sir Samuel Griffith’s poor apologies
of his Imperial-Conference-cwn-Mount-Morgan
trip to England, the Daily Twister cagac'ously
remarks, “ Nothing could more fully illu?tra‘e
the peril of entrusting plenipotentiary powers to
politicians sont to represent the colonies on the
other side of the globe.” This is right down on to
Imperial Federation, for under any such system
politicians “ sent to represent the colony ” twelve
thousand miles away, must have “plenipotentiary
power,” or else be about as useful as a D.T. intel-
lect, and as dignified as a D.T. leader.
The absolute necessity for the adoption of
the payment of members system in N.S.W. is
clearly demonstrated in connection with the rend-
ing elections. There are in every electorate
capable, intelligent men who would make gcod
members of Parliament but they cannot afford the
expense which is linked with the honour of being
an M.P. When payment of members becomes the
law there can be no doubt that the Protectionists
will be victorious, and that the people will no
longer be misrepresented by a pack of selfish soft-
goodsmen and a set of unscrupulous lawyers—the
only persons who can now afford to spend their
time in Parliament.
The latest application of Freetrade in
England has been very warmiy opposed. Ihe
mails for America hitherto have been carried
entirely by Eoglish steamers, but the Postmaster-
General effected a swing of £25,000 a year by
employing North German L’oyds vessels as well.
This is a consistent Freetrade action. The Ger-
man vessels may be manned by paupers and sub-
sidised with German money, but as they can for
these reasons carry the mails cheaper, the Eoglish
Government by using them buy their services in
the cheapest market. But the most blatant Free-
traders object to so fair an application of the doc-
trines of Mill and Cobden.
More “ bluff” ! “An apolooy for absence
arising from Parliamentary bus'ness was received
at the annual meeting of the Local Option League
from the lion. J. Inglis.” At the time the “ tiger
slayer of the Punjaub ” was not a member of Par-
liament. We can imagine the guffaw which fol-
lowed the announcement at the Bagman’s Club
that the champion yarn-teller “ on the roads” had
associated himself with Henson, Hutchinson,
Madgwick, Knapp, and Co. Mr Inglis’ bogus
apology is particularly interesting when read in
the light of his election address in which he says :
—“ The country is sick of chicanery . . . and
the prostitution of place and power to subserve
private and personal ends.”
The Gippsland Times is looking hopefully
forward to a bright and happy future, when
“Australia, with her sister Canada, her elder
brother America, and the parent Great Britain,
will form an Anglo-Saxon confederal ion to put
down oppression, to protect humanity and ad-
vance the cause of freedom, and to rule the world
in righteousness and peace.” Ic is satisfactory to
reflect that we are all working in that direction.
Great Britarn is investing a few more mil ions in
ironclads to put down oppression, Canada recently
s*rung up Louis Riel in the sacred cause of free-
dom, cur other sister, Sou'll Africa, pants to
let fly some more righteousness and peace among
the Zulus. Oh ! we are a Happy Family.
Sir Henry Parke s confesses that he has
formed an opinion extremely unfavourable *o Dis-
trict Court Judge Docker. This announcement is
exactly in keeping with Sir Henry’s previous per-
formances. He, like the S.M. Herald, waits
until the public mind has become thoroughly pos-
sessed with an idea, and 1 hen cautiously notifies
his approval of the unanimous sentiment of the
community. Everyone else in N.S.W. had formed
an opinion *• extremely unfavourable to District
Court Judge Docker” months and years ago
Parkes is getting on. lie wiil voice the public
sentiment next by saying that Judge Windeyer is
just about as well fitted to preside over a Criminal
Court as Frarncis Habigal would be to engineer
the Education Department.
The Balniainites ought to deal summarily
with Mr. Garrard at the forthcoming election.
Hitherto during his political career he has been a
consistent advocate of a discriminating system of
Protection, but now he says: ‘ Sometimes it is
better to lav one’s views on one side in view of an
important crisis, and, therefore, if returned, I
shall go in a supporter of Sir Henry Parke 3. ’
And yet the issue put before ilie country by Sir
Henry Parkes is Freetrade v. Protect on ! In place
of direct Protection, such as Garrard has hitherto
advocated, he talks about assisting industries by
bonuses rather than by “ a dangerous experi-
ment.” In other words, ho wsll throw overboard
his old political creed rnd support the man who
helped to kick him out of office a little over 1
months ago!
In Freetrade England women are paid
a penny a thousand tor cutting out and making
paper bags of assorted sizes. Match-boxes are
paid for at the rate of two-.pence farthing per
gross, the women who make them at that price
finding their own pas e. Good cabinet-makers arc
rather better paid. By working about 15 hours a
day every day in the week they sometimes make
as much as Bs. 9d. for 105 hours’ work. But it is
not every workman who can rake in thatsum, and
none of them can do it every week. Under the
peculiar and lop-eared blessiDgs of Freetrade,
N.S.W. mechanics will be afforded an opportunity
of competing with these industrious Londoners ;
but as they already have to compete with China-
men, the competition of these Londoners can
hardly be noticed.
If there is one thing which the hairless

Mr. E. Valentine Brown, who made a
little pile of money out of a libel action he took
against Melbourne Punch and then rubbed in his
revenge (much to the glee of the proprietors of
that journal) by publishing a Punch of his own—
which was received with rapture in the sausage-
shops—has now got into more trouble, out of
which, we have no doubt, he will again emejge
covered with glory ar,d stuffed with bank-notes.
He has been suspended for “sas3iDg” the Pre-
mier’s secretary. Mr. Brown is a long, thin, yel-
low young man, who looks as if he wrote a good
deal of bilious poetry in secret and regarded his
present environment as a prison in which his
seething genius had no room to werk. Let him
take heart. He is not alone in his illusion. Mil-
lions of young men have similarly caracoled into
the arena of existence, and after being spilled and
trodden in the sand two or three times have come
to think in a similar way, but have generally
ended as contented citizens keeping a wood-and
coal-yard or a little public-house. 1$ is only
foolishness for him to launch his little earthen
pipkin on the river among the metal-pots. Let
him keep with his kind, and who knows but that
one day fie may become a C.M.G.

Parkes’ announcement of the N.S.W.
Ministerial policy last week was the Dictator’s
method of exclaiming, “Alone I done it!” By this
early disclosure of the programme is proved the
fact that the only shire Sir Henry’s colleagues
had in that policy was giving a mute approval as
the price of their portfolios. The Hemperor’s
policy may change to suit the times, but his con-
duct is ever the same. Bo has already taught his
colleagues that they meekly follow him, but his
effort to make the House learn the same lesson
was attended with conspicuous failure.
A South Melbourne man took a touch of
religious mania, brain-softening, uorequitted love,
and the D.T.’s, so he painted himself blue, hung
out his tongue, and started round town as a
crank. By and bye, the police were sooled on,
and the eccentricity betook himself to a house-top,
and, enthroned astride the smoke-stack, he bom-
barded the force with bricks. An audience of
5000 soon collected, and the maniac amused him-
self by picking off his enemies with scraps of
chimney. The force lit a little Hades below,
and endeavoured to smoke him off like a ’possum,
but he dropped bricks upon them with a wild sad
laugh, and gibed at their high office A daring
young policeman went aloft at last, and, sneaking
along the slates, grabbed the demented des-
perado from behind, and some spirited ground-
wrestling ensued out on that slanting rcof. But
virtue triumphed ; the daring young policeman
clapped the darbies on his prisoner and handed
him down by his ear. The wrongheaded man s
name was Parks. The gentleman who lately ac-
cepted the onerous office of forming a Cabinet in
N.S.W. spells his name P-a-r-k-e-s. We mention
this to prevent misunderstanding.

Society
The snobbery of the “loyal” Australian
public is indeed unfathomable. It is taller than
the gallows and meaner than leprosy. One Sun-
day, a littls vrhile ago, Lord Carington condes
cended to attend a certain N.S.W. church, and
the man who directed the “box o’ whustles,”
though he had been lounging negligently on his
seat in the presence of his Maker, straightened up
immediately he discovered that he was also in
the presence of the deputy of the biographer of
John Brown’s legs, and at once thumped out the
old dirge. “ God Save the Queen !” Having wor-
shipped Carington first, the congregation went on
to worship God second. If the preacher bad pos-
sessed any sense of humour he would have started
with: “Oh, Lord! I hope we haven’t kept you
waiting,” or have exclaimed, “Excuse us, Lord,
while we do a little grovel!” but he didn’t even
offor up lhat half-hearted apology, and no one
seemed to think it necessary. If Carington even
saunters round incognito ia flannels to a cricket-
mau’h—a? he did last week—the attendant brass
band must needs bang out their obeisance on the
gizzard of the drum, and toot their bowed-down
admirati n on the cornet, and they always spot

the great man the instant he appears. Appar-
ently they keep an abject toady on the look-out
with a binocular so that they may not lose a chance
of showing their own vaulting snobbishness. We
don’t know the name of the insect who thus
shadows the Governor, but we havo no hesitation
in telling him or anyone else who may be respon-
sible for this perpetual outpouring of cornstalk
gush that a squashed and troddon-on frog is a
nobler animal than any of them. It doesn’t try
to be nobler, but it was born that way and can’t
help it.

Still more Krismish ! An Anglican clergy-
man in one of the Sydney suburbs was bidden to
perform the marriage ceremony over two of his
flock on Christmas eve. Well, the wedding party
drew up at the sacred pile only to find the said
pile enveloped in an awful gloom, no gas having
been lit for the occasion. The minister ex-
cused the oversight by confessing that he had
“ forgottm all about them as it was Christmas
time! ”
The friends and admirers—particularly the
feminine admirers —of Mr. Burdett Smith, M.P.,
should at once endeavour to possess themselves of
a copy of a record lately published in London “ at
the suggestion and request of frieods at present
in England, for private, circulat’on only.” Ex-
cept that this remarkable vdiime does not men-
tion the hour of Mr. Smith’s advent into this vale
of tears, and omits all mention of his boyish
sccentricities of genius, it is as a biography a
marvel of completeness. How the distinguished
gentleman gracefully adorned the Commission of
learly every Exhibition which the mind of living
nan can recall, is fully expatiated on ; the famous
>anquet of April 3,188 G, with the illustrious
lames of the committee printed on the menu,
tands out prominently ; and the speech of our
legal Bob when he responded to the toast of the
vening, is far too brilliant and impressive to be
read all at once. And when Robert warms up
over the Soudan campaign and tin prominent
part he had in dispatching the Goat-Brigade, a
thrill of pride and joy passes through every loyal
and well-ordered mind at the thought that Aus-
tralia will ere long be able to receive once more
in f o its social and political bosom “its legislator
of 10 years’ standing,” one of the most remarkable
men of the age.
Says N.Z. Public Opinion : — A man of
70, named Charles Herrock, who had recently
mari ied a young woman of 20, drowned himself

even.
An elaborate Sydney personage lias given
much offence in ADglo-Australian circles in Eng-

A fascinating Government official in a
N.S.W. country town has just been invested with
the ancient and honorable Order of th e Sack for
having attempted to kiss a girl in a coach. Many

the mighty breakers of morality that now sweep
over the land, and will be carried out to sea and
drowned by the undertow.
Cooktown (N.Q.) has washed itself and is
now hung out to dry. The new baths were
opened the other day by the Mayor in the presence
of about 60 men and boys and dogs,
and his Washup, after solemnly taking
off every rag that had hitherto disguised his
manly figure, jumped in, while an ill-bred pup o£
low instincts tried to grab a mouthful of him dur-
ing his flight through the air. He swam across,
and then, hanging on to the steps wet and shiver-
ing, he commenced the inaugural speech with the
usual “ Ladies and Gentlemen.” Of course this
was a mistake, and considering the condition the
great man was in it was just as well.

Sir W. J. Clarke, Bart., and Dr. James
George Beaney, surgeon, have entered into gener-
ous rivalry in the erection of their Melbourne
domiciles. The town house of the former, for the
want of taste in outline that it already exhibits,
bids fair to rival in ugiines3 the “ Home of his
Ancestors,” Rupertswood, at Sunbury—which
estate, by the way, should have been
named Rupertsuioof . The festive Beaney deter-
mined that when the Russians bombard Mel-
bourne they shall have a good mark to fire at.

while the elders of the church cut Sir Anthony as

comfort; he is about the only Governor in these
colonies who could edit an invoice for turnips

There are complaints that certain of the
Wellington (M.Z.) Civil servants are untidily
dressed. The manager of railways lately sent a
memo, to two or three of them with a polite
request to wear ties, lace their shoes, and sport

facetiously passed the memo, round to the swells
of the service, who, annoyed at the insinuation,
threatened a strike.

A man afflicted by mosquitoes recently
euchred his torturers by getting into bed and
making in the curtain a whole through which all
the ’skeeters followed him. Then he jumped
nimbly out of bed, fastened up the hole, and slept
elsewhere. It has been related that by turning
suddenly in bed, that is, putting the feet on the
pillow, and vice versa —all a man’s vice is gene-
rally in his head—the insects will be for a long
time bathed until they discover the trick. This
feat must be performed in the dark, and it would
be as well to sleep with boots on, as hoof-boxes
serve to protect the sleeper’s extremities and to
disgust the mosquito. Kancid pork fat is also
recommended ; it is not to be rubbed on the mos-
quito, but should be smeared over the would-be
sleeper’s face and neck, and, if neco33ary, squirted
up his nose and into his ears during peaceful
slumber. Some of our readers would oblige by
trying these two last recipes and letting us know
the resuß. They can write ; they needn't ca'l, as
we are always very busy.
To illustrate the bad effect of sensational
novels, the following is apropos. A boy in the
N.S.W bush spent all his time—spare or other-
wise—deeply buried in books of the “Jack Hark-
away” and “ Robert Macaire ” school. One day
lately a neighbour met him perambulating
the bush attired in an abbreviated shirt and carry-
ing a tomahawk. When interviewed (a 1 : a respect-
ful distance) our hero averred that he was Bloody
Hand ’ and thirsting for scalps. The local r.'edico
discovered that his brain had turned through too
much sensational reading. Fact!

years ago.
A “banker ” lias got disliked in a certain
Northern (N.S.W.) township. There were thea-
tricals on, and our manager was to take a part.
He studied it up and attended rehearsals until the
day of the performance when he sent word that
“ as Mrs. B. was ill he ceuld not,” &c. Now,
here was a how d’ye do ! The performauoe was
to be a public oue and the “banker’s” part could
not possibly be cut out. Well, the final rehearsal
eventuated at 3 p.m. and the stage manager was
in despair. Down he sent to the bank with an
urgent message. No, Mrs. B. \yas too “ind’s-
posed.” Things being so, a fellow in the town
vowed he would learn the part, and did so. At
the performance that night the manager came
forward and said, " Ladies and gentlemen, one of
our actors has been compelled to relinquish his
part owiDg to the illness of his wife, who is so
sick that he does not feel justiticd in leaving her.”
(Immense sensation amongt the ladies) “But,
ladies and gentlemon, as one of our company has

throwing up his part.” He has never been popu-

Among tho mo3t effective dresses shown

Here is a pretty specimen of an obituary
back-handtr. We take it from the Melbourne

to refer to her mother, who had married the
second time before dying, in these lines
“ Our home was once a happy one :
Her children all together :
But when Mother took her place
Her children all did scatter.”
The rhyme here may not be all that.a refined ear
would wish, but the sentiment is remarkably
limpid. Too limpid, probably, for the bereaved
stepfather.

It has been a subject of general remark in

ladies ” who want gentlemen to share rooms
should be more careful how they frame their ad-
vertisements for the Herald.
Mr. Charles Metcalf, of Exeter, Macleay-
s reet, Potts Point, is engaged to be married to
Miss Ada Rodd, of Five Dock ; marriage to take
place shortly.
Mr. W. Mitchell, of Eltham, Darling
Point, is engaged to be married to Miss Edith
Gore, of Manly Beach.

Mr. Chief Justice Darley, of N.S.W., is

whom, on tte whole, wo profoundly respect, is
rather fond of this kind of thing.

A Melbourne medico says : “ This corset-
squeezing is really a mo3t stupid practice. The
flesh, pushed away from its natural place, is
bound to settle in and abnormally swell some
other part.” Perhaps this accounts for the abnor-
mally large feet of the Cabbage Garden belles.
Mr. Foster Palmer, of Queensland, is to
marry Miss Annie Grant, daughter of the late
Hon. J. M. Grant, of Victoria ; and Mr. Kiddle,
of Itlverina, is to be united to Miss Halliday, of
Brookong.
The worshippers at All Saints’ Church,
Parramatta, are afraid of becoming idolators. A
cross, candlesticks, and other emblems which
adorned the chancel have been exorcised from
their place. A banneret and some vases are to
follow suit.
They eay in Sydney that it’s quite worth
while breaking with a Queensland squatter for the
bare shadow of a chance of becoming an English
countess.
At St. John’s, Darlinghurst, on 24th ult.,
Mr. E. Vallack was married to Miss Martha
Walton, daughter of Captain WaltoD, of Glenmore
Road. The bride wes attired in ivory gros gram,
richly trin med with crystal embroidery and
duchcsse lace, and was accompanied by four
bridesmaids, all costumed alike in cream Indian
muslin, lacc-trimmed. In the evening a number
o guests were entertained at a dance at Ki hs-
dale.
At St. David’s Church, Surry Hills,
Sydney, on 25th ult., a very quiet wedding took
place. The bride was that talented musician
Miss Eva Thompson, R.A.M., daughter of Mr.
Robert Thompson, Surry llilis, and the bridegroom
Mr. G. F. Mason, of llraidwood. The bride wore
a travelling costume of navy-blue cloth Bnd velvet
with tiny tulle bonnet of the same colour. The
hn eymoon is spent at Katoomta.

At the “ Hermitage,” Woollahra, on
Thursday evening, the 27(h ult., “A surprise
party” (consisting entirely of genllemen) was
tendered to Mr. G. E. I abcrtouche. Contrary to
the usual custom the “ surprises ” arrived singly,
but were effusively welcomed by their gue«t,
whose health was warmly drunk by all. A good
musical programme was gone tlrrough.
Two representatives of well-known Vic-
torian families were united in the holy bonds at
Geelong, on Tuesday, February 1, when Miss
Dennys consented to share the name and fortunes
of her cousin, Mr. Lascelles (Dennys Lascelles).
The wedding was remarkably quiet.
The very latest from the salon (at the
“ Point”) wherein reigns the Madame Adam of
N.S.W. politics : “ Mrs. Blank is gomgto send 'er

“ Counterfeit Charms” (the “ make-up ” of
the fair sex) is the subject which has been agitat-
ing the minds of numerous correspondents to a
Melbourne daily. We know one young person
whose beauties are the cause of gloomy doubts
and sore misgivings to us, but she cannot count
her feet charms —they are over-grown nines.
A French girl, daughter of a rich man,
loved a poor suitor, but her father would not put
down “ the stamps.” So, despairing of ever being
able to get married, they locked themselves up in
a small room and paid their passage to eternity
with a charcoal stove. There is a lot of sentiment
about this incident, but a general impression pre-
vails in the neighborhood that the ttirl would have
shown more i eal grit if she had put the charcoal
stove in the room where the stern parient
slumbered.
Parisian and London society is said to
yearn for a style of dancing just a trifle less Clon-
tarfy than that recently prevailing, and conse-
quently the pavane, a dance said to have been
originally modelled from the movements of pea-
cocks, is rapidly coming into fashion. Tin's dance
was in great vogue a few centuries ago, when
mail-clad knights used to indulge in its maddening
ecstasy, without removing the saucepans from
their heads or the belted sheet-iron from their
bodies. Similarly, we suppose, the silver-tails of
this present year of grace will undergo its deliri-
ous de'ights without removing their ulsters or
bell-toppers.
The author of “ Lovers Five and Maidens
Four ” says that if a girl's nose is cold when her
lover gives her his first kiss it is a sure sign that
her yassion is 18 carat ; otherwise, trust her not.
Would that we had remained in ignorance. Let
The Bulletin Bard yowl:—
Miss With, the latest fasting-woman, is a
New Yorker, and was a lyric artiste until corpu-
lence interrupted her career in that direction.
She has, like Succi, a mysterious nutritive fluid.
She says that she discovered it while travelling
in .Australia, where she was exposed to hunger,
and found that she could live a long time on a few
drops of the liquid without losing flesh. An
Australian lady who has kept a boarding-house

“Mr. J. C. Neild said that he would have to take time to consider whether he

wants to fast also, we hear. She says she has gone six
weeks with only a liitle tea in the mornings. She
has no mysterious fluid, but relies solely, no
doubt, on the training she got in the regular
course of her business.
We are told that Lady Colin Campbell
“gave her evidence, attired quite after the
modest manner in which French ladies appear in
Court when they are anxious to fascinate the
jury.” This reminds us that the police and the
lawyers everywhere are keenly alive to the force
exercised by costume in court. Jurymen are ter-
ribly human—and so are Judge 3. The Sydney
police, for instance, are to be much congratulated
on the correctness with which they, the other day,
dressed Miss Mary Jane Hicks for her. part; and
our felicitative vocabulary would utterly fail were
we to try and give utterance to the admiration we
felt for the millinerial acumen of the foorce on
beholding that artful young bundle of hysterics,
Miss Grace Porters, in the witness-box at New-
town the other day. A red feather will often
damn the evidence of a woman who otherwise is
the very parsonification of the lilies and langour
of virtue; but just you let Policeman X or the
Crown Prosecutor substitute heliotrope for scarlet,
comb back Anonyma's bangs, and plaster the result
flat on to her forehead with bandoline, and you
can safely leave the rest to Anonyma’s modest
voice, downcast eyes, and shapely shouMers. We
once saw a Sydney barrister —he is not in
Parliament just now —“fake” the court-
toilet of a lady who, after spending half her hus-
band’s fortune in fizz for “ the boys,” and the
other half in diamonds and sealskin for herself,
wanted to get a divorce. This little dress re-
hearsal all took place in the chambers of the limb
of the law. “Ah, Mrs. , good morning—how
do you do ?” said the eminent counsel. “ Pray
take a seat. Ah, by the way, please stand up for
I moment and face me. Um ! I must say that I
on’t much like your hat. It’s too high and your
eil is a shade too dark. You have a very clear
omplexion and good eyes, and while your navy-
>lue tailor-made dress fits you nicely and looks
nodest but appetUante, you completely spoil the
vitness box effect by that atrocious brown fall,
vhich, I may tell you, is in any case too long,
fou must go at once down the street, and get a
diver-grey silk veil—acd now, listen to me, only
wo-thirds as long as the one you are wearing.
And I don’t mind telling you that you’d better
3ut a quieter bird in your hat, for fl.'s Honour ”
And so cn. But to return to La r y Colin :
“ She was dressed entirely in black, with a most becoming
French bonnet. She eat square to the front, facing the
30unsel, and had her feet ccquettishly encased in patent-
leather boots—which were well “gummed,” and she kept
them alwajs cn evidence. She is a swarthy-skinned woman,
with a good deal of the Jewish tjpe about her, and wears
her black hair combed over her forehead. She had a nasty
hacking little cough, and sipped occasionally from a glass of
water at her elbow, besides every now and then sn ; ffing at
her bottle of salts. Whenever the judge made a remark she
turned her large dark eyes on him ; at other times she looked
at the bodv of the Court, and occasionally cast furtive
glances at the jury.”
A pretty woman who wants a divorce a? a rule only
has to “ turn her large dark eyes on the judge. ’
Lady C. evidently knows her way about.
Some girls, at a little party, recently, got
up a new order, and wished to initiate the young
men into iis mysteries They took possession of
the front parlour and closed the folding-doors,
leaving one of their number on guard. The gentle-
men found one youth had di-appeared, and won-
dered what had become of him. The lodge being
in readiness for candidates, one of the young men
was escorted into the room. He found four
blushiDg maidcDS standing in a row in a corner of
the room, with a chair in front of them. Upon
this he was seatei and blindfolded, and then tola
that one of the girls would kiss him. If he could
guess her name he would be privileged to repeat
the osculation. Of course, he made a miserable
failure; but instead of being allowed to retire, he
was compelled to occupy a seat on the opposite
side of the room. Just imagine his feelings, when
the next victim was led in and had been prepared
for the sacrifice, to see the missing beard'ess youth
rise up, ghostlike, from behind th@ girls, imprint
a good, sound smack on the uplifted and expectant
lips of the candidate, and then dodge back to his
place of concealment. One after another the
young men were victimised. The fun of it was,
though, to hear some of them demand more than
one trial before the removal of the hoodwinks —
one, a well-known physician, not being content
with less than three kisses. He was enthusiastic
over their sweetness, until the sweet was turned
to gall as he saw the hoy salute his successor on
the throne of mystery.
At Birmingham, some months ago, a
cataleptic Methusahih took unto himself a young
girl of the period, and in the Deautiful language of
the Scripture they became one flesh —though one-
half the flesh was almost extinct from old age.
Before the marriage ceremony the grey-haired
gorilla told his adored one that his habits had got
kind of fixed, and he could hardly alter at his age,
and she assured him she wouldn’t dream of asking
such a thing. But when lie took two cats and a
dog to roost with him she turned pale, and asked if
they were among the habits that had become fixed,
and when he answered in the affirmative she
broke the back of the wild beast show with a
poker, and threw it out of the window. The old
man sat up in his bunk and sobbed all night, and
the bride got what slumber she could on the table.
She woke up in the morning to call him a hydro-
phobiated old fool, and the aged one, who was quite
sloppy with grief, only wailed out, “ Boohoo, ro, /
poor ca a-a-a-ts !” Then the young lady became
irresponsible ror her actions, and walloped the
old man with the tongs, and a divorce case is pro-
ceeding.
There seems to hare been something
crooked about ihe curious Scott-Sebright divorce
case. Miss Scott’s tale wa3 that Sebright—after
involving her in money muddles—terrified and
tricked her into a marriage. Sebright’s counsel
offered no real defence and the contract was de-
clared invalid. It i 3 now hinted that Miss Scott
was not quite such a little silly as she represented
herself to be, but that Sebright accepted a divorce
in lieu of prosecution for fraud. Under these
circumstances the Queen’s Proctor i 3 likely to put
in his spoke.

Shortly before Justice Windeyer left

Dr. Russell, of Christchurch, N.Z., who
has been arrested for procuring abortion, and who
has since attempted to commit suicide, has been

He has been an enthusiastic advocate of tcetotal-

The editor of the Gladstone (Q.) Observer
requested his readers in a recent issue to excuse
errors and omissions. He was laid up, he said,
with a bad ulcer and was also suffering from ague

years. It was generally considered that he should
be excused.
Dullard—Thomas James Dullard—is the
name of the printer and publisher of the Mel-
bourne Daily Telegraph. He must have been
born expressly for the purpose of printing and
publishing that paper. There is no accident in this
appropriateness of name. It is a solemn and awe-
inspiring example of the eternal gravitation of
like to like.
According to the Sydney D.T., Lord
Augustus Loftus has been doing Australia a good
turn by drawing attention to the Parnell gold-
smelting process, with a view to getting it adopted
in the Kaboonga mine, recently floated in the
London market. Perhaps the D.T. will modify
its raptures, however, on learning that the de
parted henologist is, or was until recently, a share-
holder in the no doubt very excellent process
aforesaid, and is only looking after his own
interests after all.
Sir Robert Stout, of New Zealand, did a
long agnostic preachment at Dunedin on Christ-
mas Day, in the course of which he said he didn’t
believe in heaven, and was prepared to eat Pur-
gatory with the hair on it, the remarkable result
being that the locel Catholic bishop has written
seven letters to prove that the Premier may be
saved after all— thanks to his invincible ignor-
ance. We have since laid the matter before an
eminent sky pilot with a clean shwe, and he in-
forms us there are two kinds of ignorance, the
first being divided into three sub sections of cada»
verous stupidity. The following is the analysis :
“ * Ignorance ’ is, in Roman theology, the absence of know
ledge in one capable of acquiring it. It is of two kinds: 1.
Vincible (a) Simple, when some, but not sufficient, pains are
taken to remove it; (b) Crass, when scarcely any means are
used : and (c) Affected, when a person wishes to be ignorant
in order to sin more freely. 2. Invincible, which is held to
excuse altogether from sin, since no moral guilt cm be in-
curred without an intention, direct or remote, of violating
the divine law. ’
Sir Robert Stout is therefore to go to Paradise
through his abyssmal, hopeless, incorrigible ignor
ance, and will be announced at the gate as
hopeless idiot from New Zealand.” Strangel;
enough, however, he is enraged at f earing tha
he will be saved, and is preachiDg sermons t<
prove that if there is a Shcol he is going ther<
I straight.

At Taree (N.S. W.), on a rac )nt Sunday, a

The lowest depth of grovel ha 3 been bot-

an incurable idiot, who signs himself “ Litteras,”
(he missed one “s”) advises the Queensland Post-

ducing stamped envelopes, as he considers it dis-
respectful, in a measure, to “ lick the Queen’s

In Australia when a man burgles your

foil —not necessarily for publication but as an
evidence of good faith—and a note from the de-

[ Carlton (Vic.) Bench the other day on a charge of
£ stabbing another man. It is a curious thing that
oystermen seem to be so peculiarly truculent.
Perhaps it is something in the oysters. Oysters—
and bottled porter—have been intimately asso-
ciated with wickedness time out of mind. How
many bright spirits have taken their first step on
the road to ruin at an oyster-supper ? The oyster
is wicked and nocturnal by nature, and fills those
who swallow him with similar villainy. On the
other hand, you will notice that he is not a popular
esculent at feasts, where good people gather to
gorge piously on all other dishes They have a
healthy terror of him. One sack of oysters would
be enough to demoralise a whole churchtul of in-
cipient cherubim.

The Sydney Evening Noose, the “ work

”It is time the opprobious term ‘black'eg,’ as applied t
men willing to do honest labour, we e abolished.”
Hi-yah ! Wouldn’t the Noose like also to abolis]
the term “ Chinaman ”as well. He’s anothe
man who is willing to do honest labour ant
doesn’t care who suffers by it. Same remark ap
plie3 to the kanaka. Let’s abolish the name ant

The logic of the N.S.W. Freetrader is
indeed fearfully and wonderfully built. Mr. Wise
speaking at South Sydney, said that “ excepting
hone3t Mr. Luscombe, they would scarcely find a
native gentleman who was a manufacturer here.’
Evidently the Freetrade system does not grow
manufacturers, and when any of the species do
find their way to N.S. W., they are men who have
brought the brains and the capital from a pro-
tected country. After a few years they have only
the brains to take back again.
Mr. Griffin, a candidate for the Hawkcs-
bury electorate, says the D.T., “calls himself a
Freetrader, bat favours import duties on agricul-
tural produce. He is an ardent supporter of Sir
Henry Parkes.” This is a “ non-independent ”
man after Sir ’Enry’s own heart. He favours
what Sir ’Enry mrst emphatically condemns, yet
if he is returned he is to be an “ ardent supporter ”
of the new Government. Perhaps Mr. Griffin
will tell some of the “ old boys” at Windsor and
Richmond that he and Parke 3 are in favour of the
flogging law. If he does he will require the
strength of a Griffin and the agility of a Samuels
to enable him to return to Manly with a whole
skin.
In the Compbell divorce-case it transpired
that Lady Colin Campell and her husband we' e so
hard-up when they married that her ladyship had,
in order to get furniture for her house, to go rouod
and pick up bit by bit at auctions. This forms an
admirable illustration of what was saitbin the
article by Adam Badeau. lately re-printeoin The
Bulletin, about the meanness of tho British
aristocracy. Here is the brother-in-law of an
English Prince 3?, the son of a m6st wealthy I)ake,
compelled to let his wife scour round among the
rale-rooms, and write London letters for Austra-
lian papers, simply because he happens to be a
younger son. The elder brother is “hung with
diamonds” ; the younger is kept in pauperdom
merely in order that the head of th 9 house of
Argyle may glitter.
Improved Street Architecture.
Tiie citizens are indebted to Mr. J. E; Reading,
the well-known, old-established dentist of this
city, for a new and most attractive introduction
to our domestic architecture. On a fine block of
land in Elizabeth-street, one door from Park-
street, and right facing Hyde Park, the grandest
domain in Australia, Mr. Reading has had built
to his order two n«w city residences whose ap-
pearance is a decided improvement to the eye 3.
The edifices are of a composite Gothic style of
architecture, and, as far as we know, aic the only
buildings of the kind which have been put up in
Sydney. The facade is romantic and pictur-
esque, and while possessing a rich simplicity
of design so to speak are as free from overpower-
ing detail as the most aesthetic mind could desire.
Tre buildings stand in from the street level some
distance, and even then stand in behind their
Gothic dornments. Within, the whole design is
four d to be free from basement to topmost floor,
anc there is comfort, light, refreshment, and room
or every hand. In erecting such buildings, Mr.
Ptading, who by the way is very largely interested
T city property, has signally gauged an improved
>• iblic taste, and he is to be complimented on his
enterprise. The architects, Messrs Humphrey
and Cracknell, whose originality and ability are
shining in a great deal of our city architecture,
have made a decided hit in working out the
whole plan of these buildings, and it
would be satisfactory if Mr. Reading had
many followers in the new line he has with
the aid of his architects struck out for the city.
The contractor for the work is Mr. W. Baker, one
of the best-travelled and most experienced men
we have in the trade in this country. The edifices
have gone up without a flaw, and are sound and
solid from the very bedrock. We give a sketchy
view of the new buildings, and will give this
domestic architecture generally a little more
consideration than has hitherto been shown to it.*
Mr. John Nobbs.
Ove of the candidates for Parliamentary honors
at the Central Cumberland election will be Mr.
John Nobbs, of Granville, and doubtless on the
strength of his past yeara of services to the dis-
trict he will be returned. There can be no ques-
tioning the fact that Mr. Nobbs has done huge
service to the most populous part of this elector-
ate, distancing even the Parliamentary represen-
tatives in a watchful effort on behalf of the people.
Few men stand better with the public, a 3 in addi-
tion to being a man of active public spirit he
is second to none in private and commercial enter-
prise. Mr. Nobbs was the founder of the Cumber-
land Independent, which paper he ran
purely in the public interest on a very
heavy private outlay. At Granville he has
been the soul of that most prosperous centre, and
there can be no doubt that it was his activity here
which caused Parramatta to awaken from her
slumbers to become as she is now —a go-ahead,
prosperous inland town. This work should stand
Mr. Nobbs in good stead. Nor should his per-
sistent work on behalf of the interest of the
Cumberland fruit-growers be overlooked. Mr.
Nobbs is a Freetrader and a staunch Liberal.
In the season of Sir Henry Parkes’ unpopu-
larity he had a staunch supporter in
Mr. John Nobbs, and Granv'lle, Parramatta,
Liverpool, and, in fact, all parts of the Cumber-
land constituency were always true to the veteran
chieftain, mainly through the fidelity of the pro-
minent men of this constituency. Mr. Nobbs has
been a persistent opponent of the Dibbs- Jennings
Government, and holds them and their supporters
responsible for the present financial danger of the
country. Mr. Nobbs is one of the leading Free-
masons of the metropolis, and one of the founders
of the Grand Lodge of New South Wales *
ANOTHER GREAT TRIUMPH BOTH IN
EUROPE AND AMERICA.
The famous St Louis Lager Beer, pronounced
by the best analytical chemists, both in Europe
and America, to be the puiest and most whole-
some Lager Beer extant. ,4.
The shipment of this Bottled Beer to Europe
has astooished the people of the >old World, as
wiii be seen by the following extract from the
Continental Gazette of Paris :
“ The most surprising triumph for an Ameri-
can product at the Palis Exhibition was the
succ- i s of the Anheuser Busch famous St. Louis
Lager Beer, which eclipsed Bass, Barclay and
Perkins, Allsopp and Guinness, the world re-
nowned English brewers, as well as hundreds of
rivals from Austria and Bavaria. It is surprising
that a great sensation was produced when it was
understood that the experts reluctantly pro-
nounced the St. Louis Lager Brer superior to any
malt liquor ev' r drunk upon the Continent, and
that all Pa is is now seeking to quaff the Ameri-
can nectar. ’
The merits of this Beer are now becoming so
well known by the Australian public that its im-
portation in Sydney Melbourne, Brisbane and
Adelaide is rapidly exceeding in quantity all other
well known brands.*
New Zealand Insurance 'Company. —One or
two errors occurred in the report of the New Zea-

£lO 000 stands at £135,000 ; and the re-insurance
fund stands at £235,000 The latter great fund is
invested in first class securities yielding str ady
profits to the Company. Altogether the New
Zealand Insurance Company takes the form of a
national csnce n, and must continue to develope in
wealth and importance. At the annual meeting
held in New Zealand the general manager, Mr.
J. P. Pierce, who recently visited Sydney, Mel-
bourne, &c., spoke in most eulogistic terms of
the management of the Australian branches.*

JN CHARLOTTE-PLACE.
Among the many prominent names in connec
tion with the wine and spirit trade ia this colony,
few are better known and none more highly re
respected than that of Messrs. D. Allt and Co., o'.
Charlotte-place, Sydney. Situated in a compara-
tively quiet thoroughfare, and in an unpretentious
building, so far at least as outside show is con-
cerned, the extent of the business carried on by
this firm is not measureable by the external
appearance of their premises. The store, though
somewhat narrow, is of great depth, and cot tains
three floors of large area in addition to extensive
cellarage. The business itself was established iD
1859, but the premises now occupied by the firm
were only erected about five years ago, and con'
tain all the mo3t modern improvements and con.
veniences, The stock is not only a large one, lut
it is very varied, for, to quote Mr. Allt’s words,
“ We keep every description of wine, beer, and
spirits of every brand worth having, for we don’t
believeinbeingunableto supply any order that may
come in.” And an inspection of the premise-
amply supports Mr, flit's statement. The very
slight acquaintance with stimulants of any kind
possessed by the average reporter is not sufficient
to carry him through this inspection without ask-
ing a lot of questions as to the contents of this or
that tier of casks or pile of cases, representing
everything drinkable, from the homely beer to
the appetising liqueur, the democratic rum to the
delicate claret or the ducal champagne. Every
known brand is apparently there, including, of
course, everybody’s favorite, Clausen’s C hampagne
Lager Beer, of which Messrs. Allt and Co., dispose
of a large quantity annually, and with regard to
which they are pleased to say I hey believe it to be
the best Lager Beer in the world, being absolutely
free from any intoxicating or deleterious proper-
ties, highly invigorating and perfectly pure. It
leaves no unpleasant taste in the mouth, as is the
case with so many other so-called Lager beers
and customers who have c nee had it, order it in
preference to any brand in the market. The value
of such testimony fiom such a source is at once
apparent, as the class of business so successfully
conducted by Messrs. Alt and Co. during the last
eight and twenty years is of itself a guarantee
of their intimate knowledge of the wants and
opinions, the likes and dislikes of their long list of
customers.
•• A PIPE! It is a great comforter, a plea-
/V sant soother; blue devils fly before its
honest breath. It ripens the brain, it opens the
heart ; and the man who smokes thinks like a
sage and acts like a Samaritan.” So, evidently
thought Bulwer Lytton when he put the word*
into the mouth of one of his best drawn charac-
ters. But in addition to this, he meant —what he
did not actually say—that the tobacco itself must
be of the very best description Disinterested tes-
timony of the highest character will prove that
“BLACKWELL’S BULL DURHAM
TOBACCOS
Are superior to any tobacco ever before offered to
the Public.
Dr. AUGUST VOELCKER, F.R.S., Consulting
Chemist to the Royal Agricultural Society of Eng-
land, after making a thorough analysis of the
organic and inorganic parts of various samples of
L*af Tobacco, says : —“ With regard to the Leaf
Tobacco from which ‘ BLACKWELL’S BULL
DURHAM’ is manufactured, I find in this mag-
nifioent Tobacco merely traces of Nitrates, which,
perhaps, is one of the reasons this tobacco has a
very mild taste, for in all biting, strong Tobaccos
I find, invariably, that Nitrates are present in con-
siderable proportion. Another and still more im-
portant fact which my analysis has brought to
light is that this Tobacco contains so little Nico-
tine, which I am inclined to regard as a good fea-
ture. Strong and inferior Tobaccos are found to
contain much more Nicotine, some as high as
three or four times as much as I find in this.”
The section of the country koown as the Golden
Belt of North Carolina, to which Durham is the
natural outlet, is specially adapted to the growth
of this leaf, and the pick of this growth is secured
for the manufacture of the “Bull Lurham ”
Tobaccos.

An Autophone costa but 30s. and is a joy for ever.
II
The Autophone is a wonderful little instrument
which, while it weighs less than three pounds has
the lungs of a full sized parlor organ, and executes
its music with absolute precision and perfect
effect. It has twenty-two reeds, plays in three
keys, and all the paits of most difficult music. On
it a child can correctly play, without instruction,
any of its music, wmch at present consists of over
300 selections from hymns, oratorios, operas,
waltzes, polkas, marches, popular songs, &c. It
is best adapted to the kind of music which suits an
organ best, but also has wonderful power in exe-
cuting very lively pieces. &3T It is pitched for the
voice , and has a little card holder for convenience
in singing. It is entirely well adapted for country
churches, Sunday schools, the family circle, and
also for dancing. The music is compact, and far
cheaper than that which is made for any organette.
The Autophone is like every other good thing, the
longer you have it the better you like it, and as
new music is being published every week it has an
endless fund of amusement in it.

“ Elgin National Watch Co., Chicago,
“ Gentlemen, —It gives me pleasure to state
that the performance of the Watch manufactured
by you, and marked ‘B. W. Raymond No. 19,201,’
which I have carried in my pocket for a period of
six months, surpasses in excellence that of any of
the fine watches I have hitherto tested. Tt main-
tains its rate even better than a fine box chrono-
meter by Negus, belonging to this observatory.
I have intended, when I shall have leisure, to
make a complete test of the isochronism of the
balance for poise and temperature. So far as I
can judge by the performance of the watch, these
adjustments appear to be nearly perfect.
“ Permit me to congratulate you upon the

equal in performance to the pocket chronometers

European makers.

Cottages Ready Built.
A RARE opportunity i i now offered to people of the
artizan community to procure a ready-built cot-
tage for the purpose of residence in the suburbs of
the city. The Mercantile Building. Land, and
Investment Company, whose now olliees havejust
been opened at the corner of Park and Cast ler eagh
streets, have had erected several neat and com-
fortable coitagcs on the very be3t situated land at
the marine suburb of Rockdale. These cottages are
faithfully and well built, and having five or six
ro )ms, with balcony, neat front garden, afford
ample accommodation for a family. The attrac-
t'on of the thing is that on the payment of the
snail deoostt of Five Pounds, any person
becomes the owner, and enters into possession,

company as rent at the very low rate of from 11s.

liberal arrangement ever made, and ought to put
numbers of men into “castles” of their own.
Anyone who knows the locality will say that the
situation is capita). It is within a few hundred
yards of Lady Robinson's Beach, and Saywell's
tram runs past to and fro between Rockdale
station and this glorious watering and bathing
place on Botany shores. Plans of the cottages
with full particulars, are procurable from the

Extensive Brick and Timber Enter-
prise at Newtown.
A very extensive timber and building enterprise
is carried on at Newtown by the well-known firm
of Messrs. Tubrett and Draper, whose manufac-
tures embrace the whole requirements of the
building and contracting trades. The two
branches of manufacture are carried al.ong on
different sides of the main road, yet in close
proximity to each other, and they both have the
advantage of first-class position. The timber
works occupy an area of nearly t vo acres, having
a frontage of just 200 yards to the Illawarra rail-
way line adjoining the St. Peter’s station, with
facilities for a siding when required. The works
themselves comprise a lofty and extensive edifice
specially designed and built for the purpose,
affording splendid engine and machinery room.
The basement lias a separate department for an
engine room, which is furbished with a splendid
2oh.p. horizontal engine (supplied from a 35b.p.
boiler) fitted with huge fly-wheel and governing
appliances to ensure an even speed whether the
break down or the tennoning saws are in operation.
The break-down and large circular saws arc
situated so a3 to conveniently receive large logs of
timber from the yard. After boing operated upon
here the lengths are passed along to other benches
on the same floor, or overhead to the extensive
joinery and finislm g dopaitments. Here the
capacity of the works is found to be great, the
machinery being of the very latest description,
including turning, planing, mortising, and mould-
log appliances, and the entire work of wood-
working manufacture is carried on, including
doors, sashes, mouldings, archi'rives, staircases,
show windows, show cases, mantelpieces, &c.,
&c. There can be no doubt that a
better equipped or better designed establishment
is hot to be found about Sydney, and there is every
room for its extension if required. At the southern
end of the works arc a fine range of stables for
the horse teams. 1 he brick-works arc situated
bn the opposite side of the St. Peters-road. and
are known as the Ashford Steam Brick Works.
(fas*
1 -M
%
They occupy over four acres of land, and have an
enormous depth of about 70 feet of clay shale par-
ticularly suited for first-class bricks. The exca-
vations are deep and extensive, showing a magni-
ficent face, and the material is hauled on a truck
by steam machinery to the mouth of the mill,
where it- is operated upon and treated in the usual
way. The brickmaking machines are fine ap-
pliances, anti do grand work, keeping five large
kilns in full work: The engine is a fine 25 h.p.
vertical engine supplied from 30 h.p. boiler. The
capacity of the works is over 100,000 best hard-
pressed hard-baked bricks, and the average has
been 90,000 per week; working eight hours per
day. Upwards of 30 horses for the teams arc
kept in constant work, and the whole system
and order arc first-elass. It will be seen from this
that Messrs. Tabrett and Draper have a large
enterprise in their hands capable of enormous
development as the metropolis-extends. Their
position on the lllawarra Railway line gives them
command of the entire area of this glorious new
suburb, which is fast being built on. For the
brickmaking work the firm have material enough
for 40 or 50 years’ operations. Messrs. Tabrett
and Draper were the firm who, at the first re-
quest, granted their men the eight-hour system,
with the result that their staff of men in all
branches are the most willing and most prosperous
fellows that could be found in any employ in
Sydney. Both partners give close personal atten-
tion to the business, and are both well known and
well liked by the building trades community of
Sydney and suburbs. *

ness, for this improvement the citizens are in-
debted to Mr. John Solomon, or as he is coloquially
known “ JohnDy Solomon,” the well known
theatrical and sporting man. Some few months
ago this corner was an ugly unoccupied block, but
by the plucky expenditure of a ‘'few ” thousands,
Mr. Solomon has given the city a handsome, neat,
and comfortable theatre, which is always bound to
be a paying concern. No man de'eives more to
succeed than “ Johnny Solomon,” as he is a
genuine liberal man. When the foundations of
the theatre were being made a fatal accident oc-
curred, whereby a man lost his life and his family
left destitute. In a few days Mr. Solomon had the
woman released from want by liberally subscrib-
ing him.elf and collecting a considerable sum be-
sides among his friends. In hundreds of other
ways “ Johnny Solomon ” has made his reputation
with the citizens as a real good sort. Some years
ago he made a ton of money with his Egyptian
Rail business ; and then became a krnght of the
pencil. One or two events at Randwick cleared
him right out, but “ Johnny” sold everything he
possessed, and showed up at Tatt’s squaring every-
thing. Then he went inland, coined the golden
doubloons again, and now he is to be found in his
old position among the sporting men, and proprietor
of one of the best paying thea’res in the colonies. *
Great Sucoess in Life Assurance.
OVER A MILLION STERLING BY THE AUS-
TRALIAN WIDOWS’ FUND LIFE ASSUR-
ANCE SOCIETY.
One of the best proofs of the progre33 of the Aus-
tralian people is undoubtedly the increased popu-
larity of life assurance. There is evidence on
every hand, that the old prejudices against life
assurance scarcely even linger in the mind3 of
the Australian people ; and it is a fact that this
making of provision against death or the helpless-
ness of old ago is on every hand being recognised
as a first duty. No man can lay claim to a repu-
tation for providence whe is not insured, for both
old age and death are certainties, and few, if
any, of us are free from responsibilities that
must be looked to. The latest instance of
the steady growlh of this wise and humane
principle of life as3urance is the remarkably
cheering report of the Australian Widows’
Fund Life Assurance Society (Limited). De-
spite the admitted prevailing dulness, this
sound and economically-managed institution has
for the past year done new business to the amount
of £1,140,047, giving an annual income of
£39 630 14°. 9d. The first three years (ending
1874,) the Society issued 1001 policies for £244,140,
giving a nett annual premium of £8113, since
which time the business has so increased that now
for the last three years in succession it has
reached over a million sterling, the last year (end
ing 31st Ootober) giving 4854 policies for
£1,140,047. Quite legitimately do the directors
congratulate the Society on its success, and
this means something where the whole
business is done on the purely mutual sys-
tem. The investments of the Society’s funds
have produced the satisfactory amount of
£23,865 6s. 2d., being at the rate of over 7 per
cent, on the average funds. The accumulated
funds have b8cn increased by £78,329 10s. 7d., and
now totals over £375,000. That care is exhibited
in the issue of policies is proved by the fact that
claims on policies with bonus additions amounted
to £34,392, being an increase of only £3272 over
last year, which figures are rightly regarded by
the actuary as considerably below the expectancy.
NEW BUSINESS OF TIIE SOCIETY
for the three quinquennial periods—
The whole of this business is exceedingly satisfac-
tory, more especially as it is the end of the third
quinquennial period, and clearly indicates that
the Australian Widows’ Fund Life Assurance
Society is in the highest popularity with the Aus-
tralian people as a sound and economically-
managed Life Assurance Society. The Sydney
office of the Australian Widows is the
line handsome structure in George-street,
No. 263. The Board of Directors are
the following well-known men : —The Hon. Dr.
Ren wick, late Minister for Education ; Mr. Sydney
Burdekin, M.P. for East Sydney ; and Mr. Henry
Gorman, of Messrs Hardie and Gorman. The re-
sident secretary is Mr. G. F. Murnin. The vigorous
style in which the business has been conducted by
the Sydney office explains much of the remark-
able success of the institution in New South Wales.
From the resident Secretary the New South Wales
people can obtain all particulars as to life assur-
ance in this solid and prosperous Australian Life
Assurance Institution.*
A Gre*t Repository of Scientific In-
struments, &c. —W. M Donnell ano
Co.’s.
One of the treats of Sydney is undoubtedly an in-
spection of the establishment of Mes rj. W.
M‘Donnell and Co., the well-known electricians,
surveying and general scientific manufacturers
and importers, George and Bond Streets. For
years past this firm’s show-window was the at-
traction of George-street, when situated mid-way
between Hunter street and the Post-office. But
now their new establishment —corner of George
and Bond Streets—is the first house of the kind in
the Southern Hemisphere. In fact, it ma/ be
questioned if there is any more important estab-
lishment in London. Here are gathered the latest
designed or invented sc’entific instruments of the
day for electricians, surveyors, medical men,
“eye,” the “ear,” &c., which illustrates in a
splendid manner the intricate parts of these
organs. Another important branch of the busi-
ness is that devoted to photographic app'iances,
cameras, lenses, &c , and all paraphanalia, in
fact, for the gallery and the field —volunteer
officers' s vords, dress swords, gold and silver
watches only of the most valuable description are
likewise included. With regard to optical appli-
ance?—magic lanterns as they are better known—
the Messrs. M'Donnell stand as the house of the
colonies; tlmir collection is most extensive and
most interesting, and we venture to say that if
the variety and cheapness were known to the
whole public there would be thousands more in
use. They are extremely simple in use and afford
both enteitainment and instruction to the home
and the school. The very catalogue is worth
perusal as indicating what a wide range of work
is accomplished in th's department of science.

watchmaker?, or nautical men, the names of the
makers being those renowned in every quarter of
the civilised globe. An inspection of these various
instruments is a’most bewildering and gives some
idea of the huge advance made in the application
of science to the purpose of practical requirements.
Here are deposited a most valuable collection of
astronomical and landscape telescopes, micro-
scopes, barometers, rain-gauge3, &c. With regard
to surveying instruments, this house is the depot
of the colony, having a most valuable collection
of theodolites, levels, chains, steel tapes, levelling
staves, &c., and, in fact, every requirement for
surveyors. Next we find electrical appliances,
medical and portable batteries, galvanic chain
bands, &c., electric-light apparatus, telephonic
apparatus warranted to convey a message over 100
miles. An interesting and most valuable collec-
tion of “physiological models," the “ heart,” the
The firm have elaborately illustrated catalogues
of the various branches, and these are forwarded
post free to any address. Another branch of the
business we must not omit to mention. Messrs.
M'Donnellhave for the past 35 years been the sole
agents for Mr. John Tann, of London’s celebrated
Anchor Reliance Fire Proof Safes and Strong
Room Doors. It is needless to speak of the quality
of Tann’s sa'es, as they are matchless. Messrs.
M’Donnell keep a large stack, an inspection of
which in the cellars is well worth making : they
vary from 24in. high for private houses to 7ft. for
banks, &c. Pamphlets and full particulars of all
the lines specified above are promptly obtainable
post free, on application. People visiting Sydney
should make it a special duty to inspect this
splendid scientific repository, for the creation of
which in this city great credit is due to the
founders.*
The Be3t Cigars and Bsst Tobacco.
It may fairly be stated that there is no firm in the
colonies who should stand higher in the estimation
of tobacco and cigar smokers in Australia than
Messrs. Heyde, Todman, and Co., of Wynyard
Square, Sydney. In the interests of pure articles
and genuine brands, these men have fought im-
portant battles in ths law courts of this country
involving the issueof some thousands of pounds and
the health of the general community. There are
brands of cigars, cigarettes, and tobacco, which
have justly won a high reputation all over the
world, and to pirate these brands and deceive the
public with injurious rubbish has bsen the aim of
unprincipled people for a long time past. But as
far as these colonies are concerned Messrs- Heyde,
Todman, and Co. have “ scotched” the pirates by
obtaining costly injunctions at law, and it only re-
mains for the public themselves to complete the
good work by exercising their ordinary caution
and always go’ng for the best. Through the in-
strumentality of this firm we have had secured
for Australia the two foremost of the world’s
brands of cigars, the Henry Clay and the Flor de
Murias, which are a make of Havannah
cigar pronounced to be the purest and
finest yet manufactured. The brands are
worth hundreds of thousands of pounds, and they
arc jealously guarded by houses of reputation in
every part or the world. Mcjers. Heyde, Todmaa,
and Co. are the agents for the Australasian
colonies, and a hugely growing trade is done.
Large shipments are recently to hand of qualities
ranging from £1G to £50 per 1000 wholesale. Thus
with regard to cigars, the Australian public have
an absolute guarantee through this firm of their
being able to obtain the purest and best cigars
ever made, and no toboconist or cigar-dealer or
club with any c'aim to position can be held blame-
less if they are not able to supply the best. A no
less important announcement can be made with
regard to tobaccos. It is known that the firm just
mentioned have confined their main business to
world-celebrated Cameron Virginnia tobaccos.
When Cameron’s great works were destroyed by
fire some time ago, considerable inconvenience
arose as to supply, but the cable was used, and
the celebrated Virginnia brands came direct from
the Camerons’ works in America. Now, however,
the Sydney branch house has again got to work,
by stupendous effort, and Messrs. Heyde, Tod-
man, and Co. are now able to supply all kinds of
flat tobaccos, including the celebrated Lion,
signet, Venus, Two Seas, and early in February
they will be able to supply their constituents with
the Itaven and Navy Twists, Two Seas, and Lion
Nailrod. For the production of these celebrated
tobaccos the Camerons have got into their new
works, the finest michine y yet iavented, and
he article turned out is really superb. The busi-
ness done by Messrs. Ilcyde, Todman, and Co. in
Cameron’s locally-made Virginnia tobacco exceeds
£500,000 annuallv, and in Cameron’s American-
made over £250,000 annually. With regard to
tobacconists’ goods generally, it will suffice to say
that this firm s great house in Wynyard-square is
really ihe depot of all the best makers of the
world ; and their business is so extensive, their
prices for all lines—tobaccos, cigars, and general
good —is as cheap, and in manycases cheaper, than
the inferior goods placed on the market. The
firm do a wholesale business only, and will fur-
nish the public when required with the names of
the tobacconists and cigar-dealers who are sup-
plied with the superior lines mentioned by them.
Where trade is not done by retail men, Messrs.
Heyde, Todman, and Co. will supply samples to
any applicant. The firm invite communications
from all parts of the colonics, and, we observe,
cordially ask the assistance of the Australian pub
lie to build up a genuine business in these most
important articles of human consumption.*
TO THE ELECTORS OF THE COUNTY
OB' GLOUCESTER.
Gentlemen, —On my return from Europe on tho
21st instant, whither I had gone for the benefit of
my health, I was not at all surprised to find that
a dissolution of Parliament was inevitable, owing
to the inadequate measure3 of the Government to
curtail the public expenditure.
A dissolution having since been proclaimed, it
was my intention, although renovated in bodily
health, to retire from public life being grievously
depressed by a severe family affliction.
The present state of our public affairs requiring
great exertions][and unremitting attention in the
expenditure of the public funds, coupled with tho
urgent request of many friends, I am induced to
offer you once more my services as your re-
presentative.
Since you did me the honor of placing me in
Parliament some five years ago, you must, I think,
admit that my be3t endeavours have been suc-
cessfully used for your benefit and the welfare of
the district. Your roads have been greatly im-
proved, your postal conveniences extended, your
schools increased, and not a single petition from
various parts of my electorate which has been
placed in my hands in any way neglected, but, on
the contrary, has received my fullest considera-
tion and support; and I intend to pay particular
attention to have the important timber trade of
your district placed upon a better footing.
When I found that my absence from my post
was imperative, I placed your interests in the
hands of a friend who promised the same attention
to your requirements and wishes as I should have
devoted had I been present.
Without reflecting upon the actions and omis-
sions of tho Government which lately ruled the
destiny of the colony, I must acknowledge I found
public affairs in a most lamentable condition, and
it behoves every future representative of the
people to curtail the public expenditure by the
strictest measures of economy without interfering
with the efficient conduct of the Civil Service, to
cause imposition of fresh taxes without militating
as far as possib e with the poorer classes, and if
practicable to raise a revenue from the lands
without injury to the squatter or the free
selector.
These are measures which will require great
consideration, and can be carried out only by
unanimous action on the part of the various re-
presentatives.
The extreme urgency of remedial operations be
ing enforced upon me at so brief a notice entails
serious consideration on my part, and if elected
once more, you may rest assured that I sha‘1 be
daunted by no difficulties, nor turned aside by
any private feeling in dealing with so momentous
a question as the reduction of the enormous deficit
in the public Treasury.
1 have the honor to be,
Gentlemen,
Your obedient servant,

formed by Sir Henry Parkes, and believe that you
regard with favour the responsibili’y I have thus

ment, prepared with a liberal and progressive
policy, for relieving ( he colony from the difficul
ties in which it has become involved, and I think
you will recognise in the address of Sir Henry

dence that this Ministry is prepared to carry out
a policy which is both liberal and progressive.

sire again to offer myself a 3 a Candidate for the

Fkw people are aware of the alarming prevalence of
Kidney and Liver diseases, especially among those who
have arrived at or are past middle age. It is declared
on good authority that fully one-half the deaths in
this country are either directly or indirectly the
result of Kidney or Liver disease of some sort.
A great majority of men above 40 vears of age are
afflicted with some sort of affection of the Kidneys or
Bladder, and those diseases are on the increase. Per-
sons are often seriously affected before they know of
it themselves, and thus these insidious disorders get a
good foothold before anything is done to dislodge
them.
Dropsy, Gravel, Diabetes, Bright’s Disease, Incon-
tinence, Debility, Catarrh of the Bladder, Albu-
menuria, &e., are tteCrg the many forms of these
diseases. Most of these are very difficult to cure,
defying the powers oftentimes of the best physicians
obtainable, and are pronounced by many to be
incurable.
Physicians state that many forms of Kidney and
Liver disease are very difficult to detect, as in diseases
of this form oftentimes there are no eymptsms of a
marked nature. This is one of the fuasons why they
are so difficult to cure.
Dr BELL’S (Kidney and Liver Bitters) is a Specific

Diseases, Dropsy, Gravel, Diabetes, and all of that
class of disorders.
