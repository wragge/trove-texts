The Red Pa ge
The Psychology of the Powder Puff
Lester Way’s attempt to brand all woman-
kind as instinctively wanton is a pot-pourri
of false assumption, bad logic, shallow
science and doubtful history, with a meagre
garnish of commonplace truth. His opening
remark, “Male humanity finds an undeni-
able attraction in the highly-colored and
flagrantly camouflaged female,” is typical of
his method of reasoning throughout—that of
generalising for the whole of mankind from
what a portion may think or feel. Perhaps
the larger, and certainly the more discrimi-
nating, part of mankind, although it may
find ornamentation artistically done not un-
attractive, is revolted by it£ more obvious
and flagrant forms. Only to the unobser-
vant, too, will paint and powder convey the
“plain message” that the wearer is for sale.
Thirty years ago it may have been roughly
true; but with the passage of time these
female arts have become fashionable, there-
fore respectable, and are no more indicative
of “professional wantonness” than trans-
parent blouses and stockings, sleeveless
dresses and other freakish fashions, which,
pioneered by the fast women, have been imi-
tated and respectabiliscd by the slower ones.
Lester Way admits this later: “They do
these things because it is fashionable and
adds to their appearance.”
It is hard to see how I,ester Way deduces
from the fact that a certain profession has
been called “the most ancient” that “the
practice of the arts of that profession has
become instinctive in womankind.” He
surely does not hold that that profession at
any stage in the world’s history embraced
the majority of women, a premise which
liis conclusion seems to necessitate. Be-
sides, its members are noted for barrenness,
and only through offspring could they hand
on their traits. Furthermore, that “pro-
fession” is known to have existed only in
the historic period, a stretch of about 10,000
years, whereas our fundamental instincts
were formed in the prehistoric and animal
periods, lasting, on a moderate estimate,
500,000 and some hundreds of millions of
years respectively. It is questionable also
whether any outside the wealthy minority
amongst men could in past ages have “fre-
quently resorted to women of that sort.”
They certainly cannot afford to do so to-day.
as Lester Way, if he knows his subject, will
be aware; and it is improbable that they
could have done so in past ages, when the
mass of men could much less afford luxuries.
The attempt to trace the origin of our de-
sires and nature from the meagrely-recorded
history of humanity and its obscure pre-
history must 5 be largely guesswork; but
Mr. Way’s guesses are not shrewd enough
to. carry conviction, and appear to have a
misogynistic basis.
The ,desire to make oneself attractive in
appearance seems to need no more’ explana-
tion in women than in men. who possess it
almost as keenly, though exhibiting it more
furtively. The sexual instinct, with no
definite motive of pecuniary reward or actual
sexual. intimacy, will account for it. Nor
when, in women, it takes the form of powder
and paint, is it necessary to insist on a
mercenary motive. A woman of 40, a
mother of children, will decorate her face in
perhaps the worst of taste; but her motive
is. nb more mercenary than that of the
middle-aged man who shepherds with infinite
care his remaining two dozen front, hairs.
To be loved, to bear and rear children and
to be respected—these are and must through-
out history have been the central aims of
the vast majority of womankind.
James “Mowbray.
As for woman’s camouflage—well, one
can only, with absolute certainty, d|raw
upon one’s own experience. Let me follow
Mr. Way’s example, and tell mine. When
I look ip the mirror and find pale cheeks
and lips where youth but lately waved the
banners of rampant health, then I am de-
pressed almost to the point of tears. So I
get out powder, lipstick and rouge, do my
best with them, and am straightway cheered,
though no whit deceived by the result. But
now, thanks to Mr. Way’s enlightening doc-
trine, I shall get them out with a chuckle
instead of sighs, and listen for the feet, of
the pursuing male, as I jazz round my mirror
to the strains of
O Gee! O Gosh! O Golly, I’m in love!
OPHELIA.
The Text-book as Literature
When Charles Lamb compiled his cata-
logue of “Books that are No Books” and
consigned to it such diverse items as “The
Decline and Fall of the Roman Empire” and
the “Whittaker” of his day, he was light-
heartedly airing a personal prejudice, but
incidentally propounding a good general prin-
ciple. But every general principle exists as
much by force of the objections to it as by
any virtue inherent in itself. And down at
bedrock has the question of subject any-
thing at all to do with literature, the art? If
rules of moral conduct, as in the Sermon
on the Mount, may be literature, why not
man’s legal relations in the shape of an
Act of Parliament or a text-book? Litera-
ture, after all, is written language. Lan-
guage exists quintessentially for the expres-
sion of thought, and it is the quality of that
expression which constitutes literature.
Augustine Birrell’s short treatise on “The
Duties and Liabilities of Trustees” is as
much literature as anything in ‘“Obiter
Dicta” or any other of his purely literary
works. So, on a greater scale, a fair claim
may be made for recognition as works of
literary art of “The Law of Torts,” “Juris-
prudence” and (to name his masterpieces of
draftsmanship) the Native Land Act, 1909,
and the Samoa Constitution Order, by John
William Salmond. whose death the other day
wneant Maoriland’s losing perhaps its great-
est claim to intellectual distinction.
His two law books have become legal
classics, and both they and the Native Land
Act show Salmond as the creative artist.
He came to the subject of Native Lanid Law
late in 1908 with no previous knowledge of
it. What exactly or even approximately
the whole law was no one knesw. He was
confronted with the task of creating order
out of a welter of native custom and a host
of miscellaneous statutes. No mere legal
learning could have helped in his task. The
mere volume of the navvying work in the
statutory quarry alone is shown by the
schedule of 70 repeals in the finished Act.
In a few months, however, Salmond not
merely settled the law by the sheer force of
his miraculous faculty of assimilating facts
and of his logical reasoning, but further by a
supreme effort of constructive imagination
and an equally supreme artistry of expres-
sion gave it such a form as to create a true
work of art.
In all that he ever did, as professor of
law, as law draftsman, as Solicitor-General,
as Judge and as author, Salmond was as
well the artist as the profound jurist. His
prose style was that final Simplicity of ex-
pression which is the rarest achievement in
literature. His subjects required not only
deep thinkipg but clear thinking; they de-
manded for their life in writing a clear ex-
pression in a fair form. He gave all that.
But what made his work great was his Olym-
pian detachment from the mere combat of
the forum. Altogether impersonally, as the
expositor of law, he sought for and pro-
pounded general principles with a final belief
in the philosophic dignity of law. The
practice of law was, too. the scientific appli-
cation of principles. He would with all the
fine, edge of his incisive logic assail a
hundred years of accumulated precedent with
the rapier off one sound principle. Always
precedent impressed him only so far as it
was the flower and not the weed-growth in
the garden of principle. He viewed his own
work with the same detachment. In the
interests of legal truth he would ruthlessly
expose his own mistakes. He knew not
vanity.
His felicity of phrase and his essential
sanity of outlook are well exemplified in
the slightest of all his writings—the preface
to a summary of his “Torts” produced in a
hurry to forestall an Indian piracy. The
task —or, rather, the intellectual slackness
that rendered it necessary—was anathema to
him, yet he could give the Summary to the
world in this mellow fashion: —
My larger work'on the Law of Torts hasii alfeady
been used by many students ' (I hope not without
profit to them), but I recognise that a shorter and
simpler treatment of the subject may better suit the
requirements of certain classes of readers. I publish
this abridgment accordingly for the use of such
students as fear to venture upon the work at large.
Nevertheless, in general and within reasonable limits,
no man who can read a long book should read a
short one. I trust, therefore, that the abridgment
will not be regarded as intended to supersede the
earlier treatise as a work for students. These two
books are offered as alternatives, and every one
should choose between them in accordance with his-
capacity and energy. ‘‘For one believeth that he
may eat all things; another who is weak eateth
herbs!”
Salmond’s last days were a race between
death and the completion of another book
that would have taken classic rank with his
other works—a treatise on the Lqw of Con-
tracts, the subject of all legal subjects crying
aloud for his clarity of thought and expres-
sion. Death won by two chapters.
O’H AONIAN.
Human Thinking
The most deep-rooted of man’s lapses into
unreason and fallacy, as the ancients long
since perceived, is the appeal to ignorance—
the stump-orator’s vade mecum, and the
prime mover of mob-action. Between the
fear-inspired imaginings of the savage, which
form the historical basis of all religion, and
the dispassionate, methodical procedure of
the scientist, there appears to yawn a gulf
as wide as that which separates Einstein
from Billy Sunday. Yet the truth is that
they rest ultimately on a common founda-
tion —the calculation of the possibilities of
the Unknown. This simple fact, easily com-
prehensible when pointed out, leads on to a
psychological study of more than ordinary
interest. Almost every department of human
endeavor reveals, when subjected to critical
examination, instances of the very convenient
practice of relegating the mystery of the
moment to the capacious maw of the latest
theory. Scientific thought is fundamentally
hypothetical: having collected his facts, and
in the process discovered the reluctance of
some of them to fit into his preconceived
scheme of things, the scientist has to cast
about for a new hypothesis which will serve
to co-ordinate satisfactorily the old data with
the fresh and unclassified. The weak vessel
of theory is constantly discarded as its in-
adequacies become apparent. Rational
enough as this empirical method appears, it
is nevertheless closely analogous to the
modus operandi of the simple savage, whose
fear of unknown or half-comprehended forces
drives him to deify the sun and worship in
image the gods of the harvest and war and
death. Displaying that caution which is
such a feature of scientific inquiry, however,
the wily heathen, knowing not whether his
calendar is exhaustive, is careful to propi-
tiate deities that possibly he may have over-
looked, paying tribute, in a speculative way,
to a vague Being he calls Moira, or Mani-
tou, or Jehovah, according to his tribe and
generation.
With the rise of philosophical thought the
mysterious x of primitive man assumed the
more majestic trappings of the Absolute—
Mr. Wells’s portly old professor spent his
holidays there—and when investigation
reached the impasse in which all transcen-
dental speculation seems to end, it was easy
to talk profoundly about a concrete univer-
sal, or a unity in difference, or a reconcilia-
tion of opposites, as though the coining of
a new term could resolve an old enigma.
Even modern idealism is not altogether free
from this reproach; witness F. 0- S. Schil-
ler’s unkind description of the system of his
fellow-academician, Bradley, who lately
earned the 0.M., as a course of dialectics
terminating in an asylum ignorantice mis-
called the Absolute. As apposite a case, and
one that troubles the average citizen a good
deal more, is provided by medical science.
When the patient’s unusual symptoms set
the practitioner to scratching his head, he

truly every object which is presented to thee

BRIAN C. FITZPATRICK.
The Philosophy of Laughter
The saying of Aristotle which is inscribed
over the curtain of the Palais Theatre m
Paris, “Laughter is better than tears
cause laughter is the specialty of man, is
at once bad logic and bad science. A quality
is not necessarily superior because it is
peculiar to man, otherwise wife-murder by
poisoning would have to be classed among
the virtues. Nor is man the only animal
capable of laughter. Sir Ray Lankester tells
us that he has seen the chimpanzees at the
London Zoo “laugh like children,” and lias
often made them roar and roll over m excite-
ment by tickling them under the arms.
Laughter is probably older even than the
anthropoids. According to biologists, the
dog and the hyena are capable of laughing.
Sir Ray suggests, and the suggestion is rea-
sonable, that the human smile, which is
effected by drawing back the corners of the
mouth and displaying the teeth, is a sur-
vival of the playful movement of gently bit-
ing or pulling a companion with the teeth
used by our animal ancestors to draw atten-
tion to their joy or communicate it to others.
In man, of course, the handclasp has taken
the place of the bite, but the display of the
teeth, which is the essence of the smile, still
remains the sign and symbol of good nature
and goodwill.
Both the smile and the laugh, which is but
the development of the smile, are intimately
associated with pleasure, just as tears are
intimately associated with pain. We smile
and frequently even laugh a little when we
meet those we love, particularly after a long
absence. *
But iaugliter is not merely the expression
of pleasure, nor can our pleasures be mea-
sured by our laughter. For example, a man
does not roar in convulsive laughter when
he backs a winner at the races, although he
is immensely pleased; while he laughs up-
roariously at a good story, although no-
thing outside the story has occurred to in-
crease his happiness. The greatest laughter
of all is the laughter associated with the
comic, and the great laughter problem isi:
Why does the comic make us laugh? Of all
the answers Herbert Spencer’s is by far the
most satisfactory. His great essay On
the Physiology of Laughter” is a master-
piece of philosophic insight and scientific
analysis. He holds that laughter at tho
comic is due to the overflow of energy which
arises when consciousness is suddenly trans-
ferred from great things to small—when
there is what we call a descending incon-
gruity. Why, he asks, does a whole audi-
ence in a theatre explode in laughter when,
just as the hero and heroine, long separated,
meet and are about to rush into each other’s
arms, a tame goat comes from behind the
scene and begins leisurely to sniff at them?
His reply is that the rising tide of emotion
and nervous energy has been suddenly
checked by the entry into consciousness
of the goat, and that, as the new conscious
state, because of its insignificance, cannot
absorb the massive emotion of the one it
has supplanted, there is an overflow of
energy in the shape of convulsive laughter.
“There results an efflux through the motor
nerves to various classes of the muscles, pro-
ducing the half-convulsive actions we call
laughter.”
Strong evidence in support of Spencer’s
theory is found in the fact that laughter is
purposeless. Actions, as a rule, have some
objective. We run to escape danger.
We use our hands to perform some kind of
work. But laughter has no such end. As
soon as it has taken place its purpose has
been fulfilled. The overflow has been
effected. But a question remains. Why
should this overflow of nerve energy take
the form of laughter? Why should it not
take some other form? Spencer is ready
with his reply. An overflow of nerve force,
undirected by any motive, naturally takes
the most habitual route, naturally uses the
nerves and muscles most habitually associ-
ated with the expression of our emotions.
That is exactly what takes place. When the
laughter is moderate, only the muscles of the
mouth are affected; but as it becomes more
and more convulsive, an ever-increasing area
of nerve and muscle is brought into action,
until eventually a man may be said to laugh
with his whole body.
That the sudden passing from the great to
the little causes laughter is confirmed by
the fact that the sudden passing from the
little to the great causes results of an en-
tirely opposite kind. I will never forget the
afternoon when, at a sudden turn of the
dusty road. I found myself face to face with
Ashopton Valley, one of the most beautiful
in the world. I was speechless, motionless.
The greatness of the scene was such that all
my nervous energy and more was needed to
feed the overwhelming sense of wonder that
possessed my soul. Just as in the pass-
ing from the sublime to the commonplace
there is an overflow of nervous energy result-
ing in movement, so in passing _ from
commonplace to the sublime there is a deficit
of nervous energy necessitating and producing
muscular relaxation. There is m all humor,
in all good stories, in all comic incidents, a
combination of two elements a sudden and
unexpected transition in consciousness from
the great to the little, and it is this sudden
transition that produces laughter. I DOt
go so far as to say, as some do, that there
are only half a dozen good stories m the
world and that all the rest are but variants
of these, but I certainly contend that al
really good stories when subjected to caretu
analysis will be found to have this one
quality in common —thev transport us from
the great to the little, from the romantic to
the real, from the stupid pomposity that
struts to the wise humility that laughs even
Jt Professor McDougall publishes what he
calls “a theory of laughter.” It is not a
theory of laughter; it is really a theory ol
the beneficence of laughter. As such it is
a valuable contribution to the subject. Mr.
McDougall has no difficulty in showing that
laughter is wholesome. It is, as he points
out, good for us physiologically and psycholo-
gically. It is good for the mind, but it is
also good for the body, for it stimulates the
respiration and the circulation, raises the
blood pressure, and gives a tone to the whole
organism. It does more. It provides an
escape from the miseries of life. If the
more sensitive types of men did not learn
to laugh, the miseries of the world would
drive them mad. Nature has saved the situa-
tion by inventing laughter. Man’s ability to
laugh at the little misfortunes of life enables
him to retain his sympathetic sensitiveness
for its more serious calamities. Man laughs
that he may not weep, or that lie may not
weep too much. Byron, as Mr. McDougall
admits, expressed the same truth when he
wrote: “If I laugh at any mortal thing, tis
that I may not weep.” And Nietzsche in
one of his lightning flashes of insight said:
“Man alone suffers so deeply that he had
to invent laughter. The most unhappy and
melancholy animal is, as is reasonable, the
cheerfullest.”
When the gods made man they said to
him, “Thou shalt go along the path of suffer-
ing to the bed of death.” And man cried,
“I cannot bear it.” So the gods took pity
on him and gave him the gift of laughter.
WALLACE NELSON.
The Great Frederick
writing a little while ago an en-
tirely truthful account of Prussia’s national
hero, overlooked the worst slander that some
enemy has cast upon him —that he died of
syphilis. In reality he died of a “lingering
ailment born with exemplary fortitude. I
have recently had occasion to look into the
death of Frederick the Great, and I think I
can cast some light upon it. About a year
or so before he died he reviewed his troops
in Silesia, which he had stolen from Maria
Theresa, Queen of Hungary, and such was
his sense of duty that he persisted in the
review even though it came on to ram
exceedinglv hard. Frederick, who could not
afford to buy himself a great-coat, though
he could afford to keep up the largest army
in Europe, was drenched to the skin. He
went home rather feverish and afflicted with
a harsh cough. In due time he got better
of the slight chill that had troubled him,
and, as he persisted in over-eating himself,
he remained unwell; so he got rid of the
Court physician, one Dr. Selle, who had
been attending him, apparently because that
unfortunate man had happened to hint that
if Kingly Majesty persisted in eating so
much he would soon suffer from dropsy.
Kingly Majesty wrathfully wrote over to
Hanover, where there resided an eminent
physician of the name of .Zimmermann.
Zimmermann hurried to the king, but when
he arrived was obliged to tell Frederick all
about the health of Catherine the Great,
whose surprising immorality was probably
to Frederick’s Prussian taste. The only
way Zimmermann could keep Frederick
quiet was by making him promise to read
through Gibbon’s “Decline and Fall of the
Roman Empire.”
The trouble about Frederick was that Ins
greatest glory was gained in a war against
three women —Catherine of Russia, the Em-
press Marie Theresa and Madame de Pom-
padour of France —and that, like other Huns,
he carried on the war as much by the arts
of slander as by gun and bayonet. Catherine
was in no fit state to answer his slanders,
because she did not live in a glass house her-
self. Madame de Pompadour, no doubt,
gave as good as she received, only the Eng-
lish would not listen to her; and poor
Maria Theresa was probably so utterly hurt
by the Roman Catholic saints forsaking her
in her hour of need that she was compara-
tively quiescent. But Marie Theresa’s
daughter, Marie Antoinette, had no scruples
about holding her end up; and it is quite
probably through her agency that the in-
famous slander about Frederick, that he
died of syphilis, may have arisen. As a
matter of fact, he died because he consis-
tently ate too much and never washed him-
self. Owing to his disgusting over-eating,
which even Dr. Zimmermann could not pre-
vent, his blood pressure grew too high;
Zimmermann expressly commented on his
high-pressure pulse, just as if he had been
feverish. Then, as his heart failed, because
it could not pump the blood against the
pressure of his arteries, his legs became
dropsical; and once, after an unusual orgy
of eel-pie, he felt so angry with Zimmer-
mann that he sent him packing. Zimmer-
mann promptly threatened him with bleed-
ing piles; and on the day that the doctor
went away, Frederick duly suffered from
that loathsome complaint. Then, Selle
being recalled, he tried to get rid of the
dropsy by incisions in the skin of the
thighs, whereupon the dirt, of years began
to take a hand. Frederick immediately began
to suffer from erysipelas, or cellulitis, or
some such complaint, and thus ultimately he
died, of that natural end of man, a slow
pneumonia. The account of the trouble that
he put those to whose unpleasant duty it
was to get his body clean enough for the
grave in that hot August weather is far too
repulsive for a chaste paper like this; and
I refuse to go into details about it.
To put it in a few words, Frederick died,
not of syphilis, but of filth and guzzle, like
so many men in the eighteenth century. The
filth of the eighteenth century was tremen-
clous, and it is a wonder that anybody ever
reached old age. But the proper thing to
say about Frederick the Great is that he
died, after an illness contracted while re-
viewing his troops in the rain, and that he
bore that illness with true soldierly forti-
tude. That is to say, of course, that he
was a friend of England, and that England,
as usual, was on the wrong side.
His was the most disgusting death of
which I have record; and I should have re-
spected him more if he had had manliness
enough to catch the “certain loathsome dis-
east'’ of the morning papers.
C. McL.
Compton Mackenzie’s Trilogy
Compton Mackenzie has. completed the
continuous novel upon which he has been
engaged during the last three years, and the
publication of the concluding volume, under
the title of “The Heavenly Ladder,” sup-
plies an opportunity to survey the work as
an entity, the obvious viewpoint being a
comparison with “Sinister Street,” since both
books are novels dealing with the procession
of boyhood, adolescence and early manhood.
“Sinister Street” was a straggling chronicle,
full of perverse irrelevancies, but so luminous
with its revelations of youth that the book
appeared to have a subtle form underlying
its outward shapelessness, a form profoundly
suited to the matter, so that even the florid
and decorated prose seemed to be the inevi-
table medium for a portrayal of the years of
puberty. That acute and fastidious critic,
Henry James, became an enthusiastic ad-
mirer of Mackenzie’s style, and in an essay
published shortly before his death gave this
novel rare but calculated pra-ise.
After the first wave of laudation had spent
itself the world of criticism began to observe
in Mackenzie’s novels a futility and lack of
serious purpose, which was increasingly de-
nounced. He was urged to leave the transi-
tory enthusiasms and morbid passions of
youth, and devote his imaginative powers to
the creation of responsible men and women ;
and as the trilogy just completed is his first
serious work done since the war, we may
presume that it contains an answer to that
insistent criticism.
The aspect that lays hold of the reader
is the book’s dynamic purpose. Gone
utterly are the longueurs and meanderings of
his previous works, and in their place there
is a continuous and consistent march of
scene and character, passing through each
successive volume with such a rigidity of
purpose that the work will not escape the
label of propaganda, in spite of the author’s
express denial of this intention. His amaz-
ing memory of childhood has never served
him better than in the first volume, where
the story of a boy’s growth in religious
experience is told with fond insight and
meticulous care. He is here profoundly
capable where most others are constrained,
self-conscious, sentimental or even banal; no
other writer in this generation except Mar-
cel Proust has explored these fantastic coasts
so profitably.
The expectations raised by this volume
(“The Altar Steps”) are thoroughly disap-
pointed in the succeeding parts, which are a
barren panorama of the confusion and divi-
sion that is the present Church of England.
All the charm of narrative and. penetrating
subtlety of insight are gone, while the story
drives on through a sterile waste of incident
signifying nothing to our conception of the
characters and often unescapably dull, de-
termined to exemplify his aphorism, given in
the preface to “Sinister Street,” that boy-
hood makes the instrument, youth tunes the
strings and manhood plays the melody, he
ploughs an arid field deserted by that imagina-
tive insight which would have made his nar-
rative revealing. At the urgent solicitation
of his critics, Mr. Mackenzie lias gone in
search of a buried treasure, and in so doing
he has sold all that he had. There can be
no profitable employment for his gifts in
serious studies of adult life, and we can only
hope that he will realise that the transfigura-
tion of youth is his sphere, and the grave
record of adolescent ardors. There he can
work with a talent peculiarly his own, and
recapture the first love of those among his
admirers who have never ceased secretly to
cherish “Guy and Pauline” and “Sinister
Street.”
F. H. Thurston.
“J.L.K.”: Touching the Scottish tendency to attri-
bute every bit of Scott’s verse to Burns (R.P.
25/9/’24). A few years ago the programme of a
“Bums night” was published in advance by one of
the Brisbane dailies. Every item was claimed as a
Burns production, one of them being “Robin Adair.
I wrote to the paper to point out that the poem was
written by a Scottish earl’s daughter, but my correc-
tion was ignored. Robin himself was not a Scot
at all; he was a young Irish medico [Adair is an
Irish name] who eventually became a court physician.
“Sierra”: R. L. Stevenson did a rare disservice to
Cockney seamen when, in “The Ebb Tide,” he created
a fiendish Huish and set him, with his malevolent
mind and his bottle of acid, afloat in the South Seas.
Conrad followed suit three years later with his Cock-
ney of the Narcissus, a cringing incompetent, in his
maliciousness almost the counterpart of Huish. Natu-
rally American authors were not slow to seize upon
the type so authoritatively fixed, and the depraved
Cockney has become the chief item in the sea-writer’s
bag of tricks. In Norman Springer’s “The Blood
Ship,” which recently received favorable notice in
the British reviews, the stereotyped treacherous Cock-
ney plays his stock part under the Stars and Stripes.
And in Yankee magazine fiction scarcely a ship sets
sail without its inefficient Cockney, consumed with
spite, dropping his aitches and whining his slang
amongst the contemptuous, red-blooded American
crew. Yet I recollect, when the barque Derry Castle
butted into Auckland Island and disintegrated in the
raging surf, it was able seaman Logan—the only
Cockney among the survivors—who, by exploding the
castaways’ solitary cartridge, kindled the fire that
preserved them through the winter. Similarly, 20
years afterwards, when the four-master Dundonald
charged into the same obstacle, another Cockney,
Charles Eyre, A.B., shepherded the 16 castaways (of
11 nationalities), made fire, constructed dugouts,
built a coracle, and eventually reached the main island
and the Government stores. The ingenuity, cheery
optimism and dauntless spirit shown by Eyre during
those seven dreary months were common attributes
of the London seaman in days of sail, and there is no
reason to suppose that the breed has altered. Un-
doubtedly Huish has much to answer for.

The figures shown in the above table convey their own significance to any experi-
enced farmer. Yet this is not all. Look at the economy in labour costs. A
CASE F5/37 Tractor will do the work of two 8-horse teams, yet it can be
operated by ONE man, and all the work associated with horse teams eliminated.
Moreover, horses must be fed whether they work or not. With the CASE
Tractor —no work, no fueL
Then, again, see the reserve of power you have always at command, and
advantage of being able to use that power just when, how, and where it is neede *
Not so with horse teams-they must be rested after heavy work, perhaps when
conditions make it almost imperative to follow on with the job.
The CASE can be worked day or night—in hot
or cold weather, in very heavy soil, wet or dry,
on heavy grades and stiff rises. It offers numer-
ous advantages over other tractors oi sirdar
power —it is specially adaptable for ploughing,
discing, harrowing, seeding, etc.; it delivers
maximum pull at the drawbar, and, as shown
above, is very light on oil and fuel.
For easy manipulation and general usefulness on
the farm, it excels in all classes of work.
Investigate the CASE Tractor proposition. It
is power you need to ensure better results,
bigger crops, and larger profits.

HERB is much evidence to prove that the existence of music is
coeval with mankind. It has come, through a slow, slow process
of evolution, from the crude percussion or rhythmic state of primal
times, to the modern art we know. As man’s intellectuality increased,
so his finer feelings expanded. His emotions became more complex
and demanded a greater means of expression. Many formal struc-
tures of sound-concords were reared, only to be swept aside by advancing civilization as
circumscribed and unworthy. A high degree of intellectuality was reached before our
modern scales were evolved, but now music rests on a sure base. It is a universal tongue
of civilization, capable of expressing the most profound emotion of the soul.
The love of music is an age-old inheritance. It made possible the development and
manufacture of an instrument like the New Beale. Here is an exquisite technique, in a
golden-voiced instrument ; an interpretative combination with which the heights of the
most lofty musical conception can be scaled. It enables anyone to release all those surges
—aeons old that clamor in his being for outward expression. This interpretative qual-
ity of the New Beale is possibly its greatest attribute. It is certainly the feature which
appealed strongest to the many musicians who have so enthusiastically endorsed it.
Interpretation and Style! These are better than mere notes and rhythm. And it is because
the New Beale is capable of personal and individual expression to a greater degree than
is very often contained in a course of arduous manual effort that it so surely appeals to the
true music lover. Sold on a liberal extended payment plan; used instruments accepted
in partial exchange. Regular encasements include rosewood, mahogany and walnut.

Ishmael.
The drunken fences stagger past
Across a haggard plain as vast
And dreadful as eternity;
Flame-walled with white
And blinding light,
It burns beyond the reeling sight,
A dead and desert sea!
A wraith there is who wanders there,
Pent near that iron sky, as bare
As hell of any hope or ruth;
In some dim wise
Doom on him lies;
A dream is dying in his eyes,
A dream that once was Youth.
His lips are carved with mockery;
By life’s most subtle irony . .
‘He walks where naught is fair or green,
With strange sad glee
He smiles at me, ....
This wraith of mine, for this is he,
The man I might have been.

When the long darkness shall lift up
To show the bottom of my thought,

Spilled into time and gone for nought.
I tell you that in very truth
There is in me no more than this:
A wine-flood of adventurous youth .
Which seeks to drown you kiss by hiss.
For, Imogen, it is my boast
That I have suddenly grown wise
And poured my strength out m a toast
To your dark eyebrows and strange eyes.

The years like grey-cowled monhs O o
pacing slow, . ,
Chanting tlieir orisons and telling beads,
Tears of a woman loved so long ago.
Here in the shade of Death I wait alone
Watching the ghostly host with silent
Pass from the deep’ning dusk to dark beyond,
Where lies the cypress garden of the dead.
And, as they pass, in their lack-lustre eyes
Dead dreams arise, and long-forgotten
White arms that beckon, tremulous with
Soft clinging lips, bright eyes grown dim
with tears.
I strive to speak, my parchM lips are dumb;
I turn to flee —Death softly bids me stay.
The dusk is falling and the night is near;
I, too, must follow in the wake of Day.

The Glenelg River.
Oh, Glenelg River, far and far away
Dear world of green and gracious wonder-
Far sweeps the amber flood where rushes
shiver,
Pools weep their quiet where the laced beams
Cream. 11 drift of ti-tree falls on shelving
sand — , .
I dream of you throughout the drowsy day.
And dreaming so, forget that I no m ° r °
Shall find the aisles of she-oak and biown
Leading 6 ™ where the wild drake calls his
mate,
Forget that I am tired and desolate,
Now that my lagging steps no longer turn
To where the waters whisper to the shore.
Singing the old, old song between the hills—
The low brown hills beside the crossing
and surging o’er the sheepwash
stones,
Laden with gathered spoil of red-gum cones,
By mimic fall and crystal gleam and glide
The broken rainbow glory strikes and spills.
Hear the great south winds where the green
boughs lift
Take up the tune all the long afternoon.
Where bee-farms nestle in the hollows lonely
Comes the clear carol of the magpie only
Across the vaster melodies that croon
In chords majestic through the grey gums
rift.
Oh. Glenelg River, far and far away, j
I know your sombre stream no Lethe s
flow;
And yet I think I could be young again
If I could walk where fretted sunbeams ram
And dream the dreams of long and long
At thereat close of some November day!
No more, no more! When westward skies
are stained
W T ith the red death of day, and afterglow
Creeps up to meet the stars, the ghostly
shades .
May. greying, gather oer the ti-tree glades,
" Purpling to eastward, but I shall not
know —
’Twill be but as a vision that remained
’Mid greater things forgotten. Yet to-day
From hour to hour these memories I keep
Of grass-tree plains and quiet hills of haze,
The fadeless garnering of other days,
To hold against the endless night of sleep.
Oh Glenelg River, far and far away!

THE DEMOCRACY THAT ISN’T.
The parody on the democratic system of
government which is presented by the Bri-
tish elections might well turn the eyes of
the allegedly free nations towards the need
for reform in the machinery of representa-
tion. When a machine is required to make
bricks and will only turn out fantastic
figures in porcelain, it is in need of change;
and all the results of recent elections have
been fantastic rather than solid. The Bri-
tish elector at the moment has the choice
of three parties. He may vote for the
Conservatives because they are more or
less inclined to P’rotcction against cheap
foreign competition; but to do so he must
swallow all their ideas of privileged classes
and scores of other matters far more im-
portant in most Conservative eyes than any
fiscal question. He may vote for the Lib-
erals because in the past their party did
at certain times for short seasons stand for
real reforms which are even now bearing
fruit; but to do so he must sacrifice his
desire for tariff reform and help to bolster
up the alleged Freetrade which produces
half the national evils. There remains the
possibility of recording a Labor vote; buf-
fo do this he must set his seal to an extra-
ordinary programme of explosive-looking
proposals, as well as to all the public acts
which Labor leaders may be suddenly im-
pelled to by a shout from one faction or
another of the composite party. Moreover,
on the fiscal issue, to support Labor is as
bad as to support Liberalism; for while
Labor adopts a sort of I-dunno-and-what-
does-it-matter attitude to the whole thing
which is particularly aggravating, there is
little doubt that most English Labor lead-
ers are Freetraders. So the fiscal-reform
advocate who is progressive in his views
on general questions is disfranchised by
the triangular arrangement of the British
political machine. The same is true of one
holding strong views on any other vital ques-
tion. There is no political power in England to
which a Salisbury, a Gladstone or even
a Chamberlain could give whole-hearted
and honest support. The noise and spleen
of the conflict throws men into certain
camps and groups them into certain asso-
ciations, but in their sober moments they
recognise that they have been giving their
support to things which they abhor. To
say that England possesses democratic free-
dom is, under the circumstances, absurd.
The English elector possesses the right to
record a vote which in nine cases out of
ten cannot get him the things he most wants.
So Parliamentary elections become a mere
game, played furiously, but meaning less
than the clatter of tongues at a bishop’s
garden party.
What is true of England is largely true
of Australia. The bulk of the people find
no party platform w r itli which they can even
largely agree; and the questions that are
most vital to the nation as a whole are kept
out of sight by every political organisation.
The old Protectionist party died on a weak
compromise; the old Freetrade party, instead
of being driven to the wall hopelessly outnum-
bered, and in the shadow of the scorn of
all good national thinking, has been allowed
to maintain a secret life and keep its false
reasoning out of sight, while the results of
that reasoning still remaiii to work evil.
No man who wishes to think in full terms
of Australia can find a party at the elec-
tions wdiich shares anything of his vision.
The matters which have for 20 years and
more been most urgent mean nothing to the
existing parties, which are merely anxious
to shirk consideration of them lest they
should be forced into serious action. In
State politics there is a village outlook;
Federal leaders have a parochial horizon.
Men in office who fear to look at a ques-
tion in a continental way turn to vague
moutliings about Imperialism. . Unable to
see the margins of their own job, they fade
off into obscurantism about the bigger work
of Empire, exactly as the churchman who
finds his creed too practical in its abnega-
tion of self to suit the afternoon teacups and
the tennis lawn falls back on vague refer-
ences to Heaven. Yet, while Australia has
no party platform to suit the views of the
majority of thinking Australians, it is per-
fectly clear that the creation of a new
party to embody those views in its demands
would bring little in the way of result. The
organisations which exist have their party
machines and tlicir control of party funds;
and long before a new party could grow up
sufficiently to make its full weight felt in
politics, it would have been warped by com-
promise and twisted from its purpose by
the desire to succeed at the cost of some
loss of principle. It is the party system
itself which is at fault and which is in all
its workings the direst enemy of democracy.
»•* ' «
When an association of well-intentioned
people comes to the task of framing its joint
view of the whole complex and difficult field
of national life, compromise immediately
enters in. Very soon the private member
of the association discovers that he has
compromised on so many matters that the
general platform is far more in accord with
that of the people he regards as political
enemies than with his own individual con-
victions ; but by that time he has generally
become so attached to the association’s name
and so keen on its success that mere things
like opinions and principles have ceased to
take the central place. Much has been said
about uniting against Communism and sink-
ing all other issues; but the futility of such
action is very plain. No party based on a
mere negation and compromising on all prac-
tical matters could possibly remain a force.
The most that such an effort could do-would
be to give a constant and striking adver-
tisement to Communism. The outsider would
naturally argue that a party so lacking in
definite opinions . and so futile in action—
as any party without opinions must be —
was inferior to the Commiyiixm about which
it constantly grew hysterical. The essen-
tial falsity of party being the evil, it is
clear that a remedy cannot be found by
intensifying the falsity. What does seem
quite obvious is that all party organisations
are attempts to disturb the atmosphere of
clear thought in which democracy is in-
tended to do its voting. Compulsory voting,
compulsory registration as an elector and
all similar devices are quite foreign to the
democratic spirit. If all party organisa-
tions were made illegal associations, and all
party names and badges were forbidden, we
should get nearer to the heart of the pro-
blem.
MALTHUS AND THE BRITISH
ELECTION.
According to Pliny, the touch of a woman
at certain periods turned wine to vinegar,
blighted the crops, rusted iron and brass,
blunted razors, dimmed mirrors, drove bees
from their hives and made mares barren.
Present indications seem to show that the
sinister influence of the eternal feminine, so
dreaded by the ancients, still operates in
Europe, with as dire effect in the human
sphere as formerly in the animal. In the
multitude of the people is the King’s glory,
but in the want of the people is the destruc-
tion of the Prince. When Maltiius (1798)
opened the national—and international —
cupboard and disclosed the dehydrated
skeleton of over-population, the thinking
world gave itself up to blackest pessimism.
If, jis in those days appeared obvious, pro-
duction increased only in arithmetical pro-
portion while population forged ahead geo-
metrically, the true symbol of government
should be the bludgeon, and Herod’s mas-
sacre of the first-born was a measure of con-
structive statesmanship. The timely arrival
of the age of steam saved the situation, and
the skeleton was hastily thrust back into
its receptacle. Europe went blithely ahead
developing its industries and sending its
most enterprising sons across the seas to
open up new lands; and the mothers of the
race responded to the stimulus by increasing
the population till it reached a point it had
never reached before. The misanthropic
Maltiius was forgotten. Never had Europe’s
' prosperity seemed so well founded. Food
was cheap. There was an increasing demand
in the New World for the finished products
of the Old, and these products helped the
pioneers to open up more and more acres
of the territories yet untouched by the
plough. Before the earthquake of 1914
Europe was as full of food and complacency
as a pampered bull-pup.
The organisation that kept the prodigious
beehive buzzing worked like a charm. At
the centre of it was Germany, which was
the best customer of Russia, Norway, Hol-
land, Belgium, Italy, Austria-Hungary and
several smaller States; and the second-best
customer of Britain, Sweden and Denmark.
She was the universal provider for Russia,
Norway, Italy, Austria, Roumania and other
small fry, and the second largest supplier to
Britain, France and Belgium. Her coal out-
put, which kept most of Europe’s factories
going, had increased from 30 million tons in
1870 to nearly 200 millions in the year of
war, and with her foreign investments of
1250 millions she had peacefully penetrated
the organisation of every European country.
We have almost forgotten in these days
what a pleasant place to live and travel
in pre-war Europe was. There were no
passport vexations, except in Russia; Cus-
toms barriers were reduced to a minimum,
and the nightmare of exchange, which makes
a million marks worth Id. to-day and less
than. a farthing to-morrow, was unknown.
The incorrigible female of the race was, how-
ever, secretly but strenuously engaged in
undermining the imposing structure, and
even without the war would doubtless have
succeeded in severely shaking it. Germany’s
population had increased from 40 millions in
1870 to nearly 70 millions in 1914: her
annual increase was 850,000. Austria-Hun-
gary increased yearly by half a million.
European Russia, the most prolific of the lot,
was adding to her illiterate and ill-assorted
mob at the amazing rate of 2,000,000 per
annum. But the U.S.A., with a population of
110,000,000; had reached the point where
she required most of her harvest to fill her
own multiplying bellies: in 1913 only 10
per cent, was available for export. The
price of food was rising in Europe, and the
poorer classes were feeling the pinch. If
left to itself and the ministering-angel touch
of the Marie Stopeses, the situation might
have righted itself: but the war came and
upset the beehive.
* * * «
When Europe emerged f-rom that upheaval
her course was plain—to clear away the
wreckage and get busy on rebuilding. But
her nerves were shaken and she was in that
abnormal state which makes dreams seem
true. Each country chased impossibilities.
Russia staged an impossible social .experi-
ment, France an impossible military adven-
ture ; Britain attempted the impossible job
of holding the scales between the warring
factions. To-day the sinister operations of
the incorrigible feminine aforesaid are ter-
ribly obvious. They have created Bolshevism
in Russia, where the pressure of population
on the means of subsistence had become so
great that famine and disease were no longer
effective and a sterner despotism than the
Czar’s was needed to compel the people to
starve peacefully. They have curdled Italian
politics and produced Fascism, which was
invoked because America had restricted immi-
gration and a strong Government was needed
to induce the people to suffer in silence. They
have reduced the German people to the
status of Asiatics willing to work for 6d.
an hour and for 60 hours a week, and whose
industry, instead of being a valuable factor
in the restoration of normal conditions, is
now a menace to every country which still
artificially maintains self-respecting stand-
ards. And in Britain there are 1J mil-
lion unemployed, which means over-popula-
tion to the extent of perhaps 4,000,000, and
that means political instability, as evidenced
by the present election fought over a faked
and idiotic issue: for nothing is more certain
than that, whether the Glibs or the Blabs
or a Glib-Blab coalition or a Conservative
majority is returned to rule the country, the
same old skeleton of over-population will roll
iin to the empty banquet table, whether the
Communist Campbell is punished for print-
ing hot air or not. France is the only Euro-
pean country that has succeeded in exorcising
the blighting influence of over-population;
but even there the Frenchman’s reluctance to
maintain the birth-rate has forced the Govern-
ment to fall back on negro mercenaries for de-
fence against overcrowded neighbors. Alto-
gether, Europe is due to adopt temporarily the
advice of St. Augustine, who for theological
reasons recommended that all men should live
the sexual lives of anchorites: much more
speedily would the City of God be filled and
the end of the world hastened. Until they
do so and the effects are felt, Mussolinis
and Lenins will continue to arise and elec-
tions will continue to be fought on such
piffling issues as the Campbell case.
HOW PARLIAMENT DOES ITS JOB.
As a result of the Senate’s rejection of the
Lessee Tax Bill, the Commonwealth Treas-
urer has been obliged to admit that persons
who, prior to the financial year 1922-23,
paid income-tax on proceeds of the sales of
leases—pastoral, mining and so forth —were
subjected to an illegal impost. But, according
to his reading of the law. only those “whose
tax was due and payable less than three years
ago,” and those who lodged formal objec-
tions within three years after the depart-
mental gun was pointed at them, and that on
the specific ground that the tax was unwar-
ranted, are entitled to get their money back.
In tins cases of victims who paid up more
than three years ago, and didn’t protest, or
who disputed their assessments on grounds
other than that mentioned, there can be no
reimbursement. For “the Income Tax Assess-
ment Act specially provides that a refund of
any tax found to be overpaid shall not be
given if the application has not been made
within three years after the tax was due.”
Doubtless the High Court will be asked to
determine whether this saving clause holds
good as regards a tax that was never due.
And the Commonwealth Income-tax Commis-
sioner has had poor luck in the High Court.
In the Cameron case he was drily informed
(with costs) that the departmental regula-
tion under which owners of live stock were
assessed, not on market values, but on so-
called standard values differing in the various
States, was invalid and unconstitutional.
The effect of the judgment is that stock-
owners throughout Australia may demand a
revision of their assessments for seven years,
and the Lord only knows what this will cost
in administrative expenditure, or how much
will have to be refunded. In the Dal-
rymple case the Court ruled (also with
costs) that the Commissioner could not ex-
tort income-tax in respect of a lease included
in the sale of a pastoral property. Which
ruling made hash of all the assessments
issued to vendors of leases under the Income
Tax Assessment Act 1915-21.
* * * *
The Lessee Tax Bill was a consequence of
the Dalrymple judgment. Its Parliamen-
tary history throws a flood of light on the
scandalously hurried and slipshod fashion in
which important measures are handled in the
Australian Legislature—in fact, all Austra-
lian Legislatures. Although the bill was
mentioned in the Budget speech on July 31,
it did not arrive in the House of Represen-
tatives until October 1, by which time the
Government was engaged in a struggle to
get 20 new Acts hurled on the Statute Book
in six sittings. And the thing was not
tackled in earnest till October 9, when the
last sitting began. On that day the House
of Reps, assembled at 11 a.m., asked 19
questions, which were duly answered (Aus-
tralian politicians have a mania for asking
pointless questions), reviewed the Senate’s
amendments to the Income Tax Assessment
Bill, took the Export Guarantee and Super-
annuation bills through all their stages
(Export Guarantee provides for an expendi-
ture of £500,000 and Superannuation largely
increases the burden imposed on the tax-
payer by Hughes’s pre-election Act), and
dealt similarly with the Lessee Tax Bill
after a desultory discussion in committee of
ways and means. By this time it was mid-
night, and there was an adjournment to
stoke up. Returning in 37 minutes, the
House disposed of the Immigration and
Meat Industry Encouragement bills in 40
minutes, approved of Supplementary Esti-
mates amounting to four millions, said what
it thought of the Public Service Board—
that body had timidly observed, among other
things, that “Parliamentary returns are re-
sponsible for much of the overtime worked in
Commonwealth departments”—passed six
Supplementary Appropriation bills, agreed
to the Senate’s alterations in Immigration.
Superannuation and Meat Encouragement,
but disapproved of its amendments to Income
Tax Assessment, and whisked through the
Zoological Museum Agreement and Statis-
tical Bureau (Tasmania) bills without
amendment or debate. Then it adjourned till
next year, having sat for 29 hours and six
minutes, less brief intervals for meals. In
the circumstances, it is easy to imagine what
sort of consideration the Lessee Tax Bill
got. Yet this measure, in addition to validat-
ing a swarm of illegal assessments, intro-
duced the dangerous principle of retrospec-
tive taxation. Profits on the assignment
or transfer of leases were made taxable as
from July 1, 1923. Another debatable clause
exempted leaseholders engaged in mining for
gold, silver, oil and base metals, though not
for coal. There was also the question (it
was raised in the Senate by Deputy-Presi-
dent Newland) as to whether the bill, as
drafted, was constitutional. In short, if
there was ever a measure that called for
mature deliberation this was one. Yet it
was hurried through a jaded House at the
fag-end of a confused session in a few hours.
* * * *
The bill reached the Senate at a few min-
utes past one on the morning of October 10.
Excluding intervals for refreshment, the House
had been sitting for 13 hours, during which
time it passed the Grafton-Soutli Brisbane
Railway Bill, which involves the Common-
wealth in an expenditure of two millions for
a start, the Export Guarantee Bill, a Loan
Bill for £BOO.OOO, War-time Profits Tax
Assessment and Pensions Appropriation, be-
sides putting the finishing touches on Income-
tax Assessment and Public Service. There
were II other bills on the notice-paper and
the last day of the session had arrived. The
Treasurer had stated in another place
(Hansard, p. 4958) that “acceptance of the
Dalrymple judgment for application to all
past assessments would involve the Treasury
in refunds exceeding £lOO,OOO. in addition
to the heavy expense which would be incurred
in amending the assessments.” Pearce’s
version in the Senate (he gave the Commis-
sioner of Taxation as his authority) was that
£250,000 would be nearer the mark. The
remarkable difference between these esti-
mates escaped the notice of the Senators
present, but they were sufficiently critical on
other grounds. Some agreed with the Presi-
dent that the constitutionality of the pro-
posals was at least doubtful. Others objected
to the retrospective incidence of the tax, to
the indecency of asking them to deal with it
at. 1 o’clock in the morning, and to the
inexplicitness of Pearce’s explanation.
“First we pass a bill in a hurry, and then
we find that the job is unfinished and must
be done again,” was the just comment of
Findlay, the Victorian; “much of Parlia-
ment’s time is occupied in amending existing
legislation that has been rushed through.”
Hays, of Tasmania, maintained that it was
monstrous to single out the leaseholder
“when a man who buys a freehold property
for £20,000 and sells it for £30,000 isn’t
liable for income-tax on the £10,000.” And
“Pompey” Elliott amused the House by
giving examples of how the impost would
work if adopted in its original form: —
Suppose a leasehold with 20 years to run was
sold for £20,000, and the vendor had no other
income in the ;> r ear of the sale, and was paid in
cash; the tax then would be £1340. But if he
accepted £5OOO in cash and three annual instil-
ments of £5OOO each, the tax would be £4668. If
a leasehold with 14 years to run were sold for
£14,000, and the vendor had an income of £3OOO
in the first year, and no other income in succeeding
years, and if he took an instalment of £6OOO in
the first year and the balance of £BOOO in the next
year, his tax would be £1758. But if he accepted


, rmn a year for three years, and the balance of
£2OOO in the fourth year, the impost would be
£9992.
The Senate rejected the bill on the second
reading by 14 to 9. Therein it was justified;
•ind if it repeats the performance in every
case where it is asked to legislate in a hurry
—unless a great emergency occurs like war
or pestilence—it will render Australia a
service. Laws passed in a hurry and
••amended” in the same way have become a
curse to the Commonwealth. The income-tax
laws in particular, are a mass of complexi-
ties and technicalities incomprehensible to
the average man. Yet they could be made
simple and intelligible without great diffi-
culty if politicians thought more of the
duality of their legislation and less of the
quantity—more of the public’s convenience
and less of their own.
JAPANESE AMBITIONS.
Before the close of this year, so I read in
an Osaka paper, the Japanese Fleet will
execute general manoeuvres in * conjunction
with the Army, the estimated expenditure
on the full-dress rehearsal being five million
yen. According as many or few faults are
found, and according as these require minor
or radical alterations to equipment and per-
sonnel, so can we date the eruption of the
pseudo Japanese-American war.
Why pseudo? Of what avail the occupa-
tion of the Pacific Coast of the U.S.A., pre-
suming a naval predominance for the
Japanese? Japan cannot hope to more than
take a precarious perch on the seaboard,
until such time as the Republic’s resources
of men and munitions are put to the supreme
effort. The Jap is no fool; why, then, the war?
Certainly the Philippines are his for the
taking. There is already a huge Japanese
population there. Manila is many miles from
the States, but only a few days’ steam from
Japan. He will certainly take the Philip-
pines, and leave the States to oust him —if
they can. But still we have not got to the
meat in the egg. Occupation of the Philip-
pines, Yap, etc., does not justify an expensive
and hazardous naval warfare. Under cover
of this turmoil, Japan’s real plan is to get
into holts with China.
I discussed the situation recently with a
professor from one of the universities in
(fiiina. a keen student of international affairs.
He said that the consensus of opinion as to
the feasibility of a Japanese invasion was
that the lack of transport facilities and the
vast distances involved are China’s protec-
tion. He was wrong. With the present
large passenger-carrying aeroplanes, and the
practically unarmed condition of the Chinese,
the rapid occupation of key-towns, fortresses,
railways, etc., throughout the country can be
carried out speedily and thoroughly. Bombs
and machine-guns would in almost all cases
be ample armament to clear spaces for unin-
terrupted landings. Many may crash from
lack of landing space, but war always entails
some losses, and Japan has the replacements.
Further, note that the armament-limitation
agreement ignores aircraft, and aircraft rela-
tively to big guns and naval craft are cheap.
Japan has, moreover, not the problem of first
obtaining a footing on the mainland. She
has a thorough grip on Manchuria, Kiau
Chau and Shantung, and she has troops in
Siberia nominally fighting the Reds. She
also, in return for financing the Northern
Army in China, keeps 400 staff-officers with
that army in the field —nominally to super-
vise the expenditure of her loans; obviously
to gain knowledge of local conditions, etc.
The Japanese are a clever people.
The next point is the action the Japanese
would take with regard to the protests of
the neutral Powers. The only two that count
are Britain and France. Both are vitally
concerned in China’s trade. She will ignore
them. France is too fully occupied with a
depreciated currency. Britain is still in a
sorry state from the last war; her most
prominent pacifist is Prime Minister, and of
her available man-power half at least are of
the Great War, and these are in the main
bitter, disillusioned men. Very well, then:
suppose we say that we can do without the
China trade. Unfortunately it is not a mat-
ter of the China trade at all. It is the up-
rising of India that matters. Now, I know
the Indians, and I am prepared for those who
say India is a nation of unarmed, ignorant
coolies, crippled with castes that prevent
unity of action. Indians cannot and will
not agree with Indians; but Indians and
Indians of whatever caste or creed will co-
operate under the leadership of the Japanese,
whose main slogan in the propaganda is
“Cast off the British yoke, and you’ll rise
as we have done!” Count Oktjma in a
speech in Kobe said: “There are three
hundred million natives in India looking to us
to rescue them from the thraldom of Britain.”
Bertrand Russell says that the only intel-
ligible motive for the Japanese alliance was
that it somewhat mitigated the intensity of
the Japanese anti-British propaganda in
India.
Japan is not war-weary. The earthquake
was but a ripple in the tub. Why should it
wait ten years, or even five? Look at the
situation now, and think of it in 1929.
France will have had time to stabilise the
franc. She will have collected her indemni-
ties from Germany. Britain will have had
time to get her trade on much the old footing.
She will have had enough of Ramsay Mac-
donald, probably. China may be farther on
the road to unity, or peaceful autonomies.
Beyond these is yet another point. In 1929
most of those who fought in 1914-15 will be
beyond the army age. The army of 1929 will
in the main be new blood, eager to show what
the younger generation can do. Will the
Jap wait for that? Bertrand Russell, in
the “Problem of China,” published in 1922,
speaking of Japanese ambitions, says: “In
the long run Japan will dominate the Far
Hast or go under.... Many unforeseen events
lmve happened in the world. America has
risen and Russia has fallen. China has
become a Republic, and the Great War has
shattered Europe. But throughout all these
changes the leading statesmen of Japan have
gone along the road traeed out for them at
the. beginning of the Meiji era, and the
nation has followed them with ever-increasing
faithfulness. One single nurpose has ani-
mated leaders and followers alike. The
strengthening and extension of the Empire.”
Now is their time. Th§ longer they wait the
poorer their chances, and they know it.
SINGAPORE. “
P. P.
PLAIN ENGLISH.
A Protectionist Country in Which There
Are No Unemployed.
It has been remarked in Freetrade news-
papers that, whereas Yorkshire purchases
of Australian wool have fallen off during
the last two years, the French have bought
vigorously in both seasons. “French opera-
tors,” said the S. M. Herald the other day,
“though they have not dominated the auctions
as they did at the early sales of last season,
have certainly been the most active pur-
chasers in Sydney to date.” The explana-
tion is offered that “woollen manufacturing
continues to be one of the most.prosperous
industries in France,” and that “many in-
vestors have great faith in its future. As
evidence it is recorded that a company with
a capital of 1,200,000 francs has been formed
in Roubaix to engage in worsted spinning;
that another (capital, 4,000,000 fr.) is going
in for wool-combing and spinning at Daours,
in the Department of the Aisne; that a new
mill in Alsace (capital, 4,700,000 fr.) is
expected to turn out 1,000,0001 b. of yarn
p.a.; and that there is 10,000,000 fr. behind
the latest textile enterprise at Tourcomg.
The respectable old Cobdenite journal also
mentions, on the authority of London
Engineering, that there is no unemployment
in France. On the contrary, labor is so
scarce that thousands of workers are being
imported from Italy, Belgium, Spain and
Poland —in one week 6000 of these immi-
grants were counted at the frontiers, and
neither coalminers nor agricultural laborers
were enumerated. Testimony to the same
effect has been given by J. R. Cahill, who
holds a high commercial post at Britain’s
Paris Embassy. A year ago, in a report on
economic conditions in France, Caiiill noted
that there were no unemployed in the Re-
public. On his last month’s report the
Daily Chronicle comments :
In essentials his picture is unaltered. There are
still no French unemployed; there is still the
rapid development of France’s industrial resources.
By re-equipping her industries and pushing on the
utilisation of her natural resources, France is meeting
the requirements not of the short view but of the
long. She is fast making herself, industrially and
commercially, a stronger nation than she has ever
been, with more permanent avenues to expanding
wealth.
The Daily Chronicle is Lloyd George’s
paper, and Freetrade to the marrow. For
that reason it does not mention the fiscal
policy without which the French achieve-
ment would not have been possible. There
is no unemployment in Protectionist France;
there is none' Marks, M.H.R., reports, in
Protectionist Germany ; none in Protectionist
U.S.A. But on October 6, after four years
of the greatest industrial slump in the his-
tory of the nation, there were 1,215,000 regis-
tered unemployed in Freetrade Britain.
What else could be expected when two of the
three political parties are wedded to a super-
stition which forbids them to interfere, when
the British manufacturer is beaten in his
own market by highly-protected foreign com-
petitors whose Governments take good care
that he does not beat them in their own
market? If Australia followed the French
example there would be no unemployed in this
country either. But there is still a lingering
prejudice against scientific Protection, and
the Commonwealth tariff is only a half-
hearted affair. Wherefore France buys
more and more of the wool that should be
sent to our own mills, and our textile in-
dustries decay.

Dulness in the Public Service.
The Public Service Board of N. S. Wales
has decided that original research shall count
for nothing at its examinations. It would be
interesting to know by what process of
reasoning such a decision was arrived at
or on what grounds it can be justified. The
Board controls the field of opportunity of
a very large number of people. Many men
of science are included among these, and
many more whose daily work throws them
into touch with vast fields ready for investi-
gation. Yet the mere memory tests of the
ordinary examination are alone to count, and
no one is to get any credit for moving out
of the rut and trying to do anything off his
own bat which might be of advantage to the
State and his fellow citizens. In these days
when the examination system is being more
and more condemned, idiotic seems alto-
gether too mild a term to use in describing
this amazing lapse. The tendency of people
in any public service is to get into a groove
and stick there. Their outlook is narrowed
by the opportunities afforded; their zeal is
bounded by the knowledge that their safest
course is to please some minor official who
is their immediate superior; their leisure is
a thing to be wasted in the easiest fashion,
because no possible employment of their,
spare time can do them any good. As a
result the business world speaks with a
ready contempt of the servants of the State,
and shows very little sympathy when some of
their perfectly real grievances are brought to
light. Apparently the N. S. Wales Public
Service Board gives its full sanction to this
state of affairs and indirectly records its appre-
ciation of it. It is not exactly a “go-slow”
policy for which it stands, but a “keep-dull”
policy, which is even worse. A great amount
of potential enthusiasm for investigation in
fields of practical value to the community is
going to waste. The Board has decided that
it is right that it should go to waste. Why
should a public servant spend his leisure
working at the chemistry of our native flora
or seeking for simpler means of handling a
mail service when there are plenty of knots
to tie in the pink tape during office hours?
Why should an employee of the State worry
over some discovery which might form the
basis of a new industry w r hen there are plenty
of printed forms to be filled in which are of
no use to any human creature? In fact,
why should anyone who drawls a salary from
the State do anything at all except come to
the office at the right time and try to look as
stolid as the P. S. Board contrives to make
itself appear? N. S. Wales has suffered a
good many things at the hands of its officials,
but the ban against original research seems
to be intended as a direct insult to the public
intelligence.
Thisyer Currency Trouble.
Dear Bulletin, —The cause of it is as plain
and simple as the cure. Money has been,
and is still being, borrowed abroad and
shipped to Australia in the form of whisky,
cigars, pleasure-cars, American films, mil-
linery, opera-singers and superfluities of
many sorts. Up to, and including, opera
these would be well enough if the quality
were right and if we could not produce them
ourselves. The Freetrade press, with fatu-
ous unanimity, declare the remedy to consist
in expanding such imports. In other words,
we ought to call a general strike, knock off
all productive work, have a six months’ jam-
boree, and at the end of it we should awake
from our headaches to find accounts squared
by the necessary imports and everyone better
off. It is a lovely remedy and far more
attractive than the sturdy but jejune doc-
trine of The Bulletin : Keep sober, don’t
borrow, pay your debts. Also there are
other quack remedies: circulate Bank of
England notes, or diffuse a new Empire cur-
rency with a broad and liberal hand. The
objection is that neither would in fact be
accepted. Anyone who desires the former
can have the notes against his good cash, but
no one else will touch them with tongs. And
what discount would sell the latter, by the
time the State Premiers had pushed off their
first cargoes as legal tender, must be left to
guesswork. The only safe procedure is to
acquire gold and to issue notes against it in
such proportion as is provably safe. America
acquired gold and forbade its export. Ameri-
cans wanted American currency as payment
for their goods. Australians want Austra-
lian currency and no other, but it must be
backed by gold, as aforesaid. Australian
currency of course cannot be shipped abroad
(which applies to all national currencies),
but then nobody wants to do it. Last month
South Africa produced a record yield of gold.
Australia can buy there, at a proper price,
and here, and elsewhere. Australian gold-
producers do not receive a proper price
because the State is practically the only
market, and therefore that industry withers,
as every State-controlled industry will wither
until the planet is a shrivelled cinder. It
must be repeated: Americans get payment
for their goods in their own currency and
will have nothing else. Australian pro-
ducers also want sound local money,
but nothing else. To transfer London
funds to Australia, gold must be bought
wherever purchasable—say here and in Africa
.—and notes issued here as above stated. It
can be stored in London as being the most
central and convenient place. The owner-
ship of the gold is the essential thing, not
its place of storage. Importing is the cause
and not the cure. Foreign borrowing is
importing. Productive work, facilitated by
real currency based upon gold, is the only
cure. So it ought to be, and so it must ever
remain. Schemes of any kind are wild-cat.
Industry is the sole salvation, and gold-pro-
duction'is a part of it. —Yours, Octavius 0.

Seven Thousand Stepping-stones.
The attempt made by the simple Filipino to
solve his economic problems by massacring
the Chinese population of Manila the other
day is not the first effort in that direction.
In 1603 the Spaniards, resenting the com-
mercial dominance of the Chinese, slew
them to the number of 23,000. Their Em-
peror sent a mission mildly to inquire into
the murder of his countrymen, but was satis-
fied with the explanation offered, and inter-
course was resumed on the old footing. In
1662 they were as plentiful as ever, and the
Spanish Governor ordered them all to quit
the islands. In 1757 they were once more
expelled. By 1762, however, they had come
in again at such a rate that the Spanish
military commander ordered them all to be
hanged, which order was very generally
carried out. The fact is that, whereas in
Australia the Celestial is objected to because,
for one thing, his ability to live on the smell
of to-morrow’s breakfast threatens the three-
meals-a-day standards of white workers, in
Malay countries his wonderful business capa-
city, which makes him the Armenian of
the East, earns him the envy and dislike of
the unsophisticated native. The Malay never
has shown much capacity for either com-
merce or government. Rizal, the Filipino
patriot whom the Spanish executed as an in-
convenient critic of their rule, is the only
outstanding figure the race has produced, and
wherever it has had to meet the competition
of the subtler tribes of Asia on equal ground
it has invariably gone under. Even in Brit-
ish Malaya, with the British Government
to back it up, the race has been almost com-
pletely submerged, and the F.M.S. has nowa-
days more the appearance of a Chinese pro-
vince than a Malay country. The Malay
displays his talents better on the football-
field than in the mart, and the Sultan of
Johore —the potentate with the bejewelled
teeth who engaged the six Australian typistes
to conduct the business correspondence
of his harem —is a typical example. Never-
theless, when Uncle Sam succeeded Don Des-
perado in the control of the Philippines, he
announced his intention, with true demo-
cratic optimism and ignorance, of handing
the group of 7000 fertile and sparsely-
populated islands back to their Malay
owners so soon as the said owners had
learned the art of government as understood
at Washington. After 25 years of pains-
taking nurturing the Filipino has been
allowed to take over the control of his own
internal affairs, with the prophesied result
of a wholesale loss in efficiency; but, not
satisfied with that, he has been clamoring
for some time for the immediate removal
of every trace of American tutelage, includ-
ing navy, army and supervision over foreign
policy. The most vociferous advocates of
independence claim friendship with the
Japanese, who are also of Malayan origin,
but very distant. Should Uncle, in a fit of
impatience or idealistic frenzy, abandon the
islands to their fate, commercial dominance
by China and political control by Nippon
are bound to follow. The Democratic party
in U.S.A. is tentatively pledged to provide
these 7000 fresh stepping-stones for Japanese
expansion in the direction of Australia’s
empty North, so that this country has a new
angle from which to view the contest for
Uncle’s Presidential chair.
The Policeman and His Job.
The difficulty of obtaining suitable recruits for
the police force has been again before the N. S.
Wales Assembly. It drew forth, on the one
hand, the usual references to police grievances
and low pay, and, on the other, the sugges-
tion that the police standard is physically
and mentally too high. If the latter idea
should gain ground the results might be seri-
ous. The N. S. Wales police do splendid ser-
vice to the public; and, though short-handed,
it is to their credit that they have dealt
with the after-the-war crime-wave far more
effectively than it has been dealt with in most
other places where a sparsely-settled country
finds its focus in an overgrown city. To re-
lax the standard because the force is a few
recruits short would be to start on a down-
ward course. On the other hand, there should
certainly be relief for officers from some of
the minor duties piled upon them. The local
sergeant who is asked to prevent and detect
crime, to preserve an atmosphere of general
decency, and to advise and help the public
in a thousand ways, should not be compelled
to compile statistics and attend to electoral
rolls. All such duties divert his attention
from his real work. The fact that a country
constable may be kicking his heels in semi-
idleness for months is of no consequence as
against the fact that he is on the mark and
ready to sprint to the point where he is
needed the moment the occasion calls. But
the question touches matters far deeper than
those raised in Parliament. Only in times
of stress and much unemployment has a police
force been easy to raise and keep efficient in
any modern country. For half a century or
so England, the United States and most
British countries drew the bulk of their
police from the ranks of young Irishmen or
Highland Scotchmen, who readily supplied
the necessary combination of brawn and
brain, and to whom the police pay looked
like affluence when judged by the standards
of their own poverty-stricken countries. This
supply is not likely to be longer available;
and politicians and so forth are hardly alive
to the fact that they are unlikely to draw an
adequate supply from other sources which
never did imicli to furnish it in the past. The
truth is that the men raised locally who are
fit to be policemen of the best type are fit to
be something else which is much more profit-
able to themselves. The sterling qualities of
steadiness, endurance, ready resource and in-
telligence, muscular fitness, tact, courtesy and
unfailing good temper, which are required of
the best type of constable, are not those of
an underpaid hack in the public service.
The need which the civilised lands must face
is the elevation of the policeman to pro-
fessional rank. Study and special training
will be necessary for the job, and it must be
made attractive by sufficient salary and pub-
lic honor. It is quite impossible that the
people who act as the guardians of civilisa-
tion and law shall continue to be classed with
navvies and odd-job men in the scale of living
and in the public regard. Japan got a very
effective and amazingly polite police by turn-
ing the job over to a section of the old
nobility who lost their rank in the change
which placed the Emperor on an undivided
throne. A commission in the army or navy
should have no higher value than a commis-
sion in our own police, with the difference
that all police officers should be commis-
sioned. A separate force of lower standard
might be employed to regulate traffic, do the
clerical work, and attend to some minor and
routine matters; but the policeman who is
capable of acting alone in the serious affairs
which may at any time be thrust upon him
should be no raw or half-trained recruit, but
a qualified professional man. Such a change
would be revolutionary and its cost would be
heavy, but it would be likely to improve the
tone of civil life; and where revolutions are
probabilities it is a wise thing to prepare for
them.

Immorality and Disease.
“C.McL.” on man’s worst enemy:—
“Q.E.D.” rather chides me because I did not
mention chinosol tablets in referring to the pre-
vention of venereal disease. The reason was simply
this: we know exactly what calomel ointment will
do, because scientific experiments upon man and
the anthropoid apes have been made with it that
prove its absolute efficiency as an anti-syphilitic
preventive. But so far as I know, no such experi-
ments have been made with chinosol in the living
body. It has been largely used as a contraceptive,
a birth-controller, and as such no doubt it fulfils
all that its friends claim for it; and there are those
who say that what women are really after is, not
the prevention of V.D., but the right to “sin” with
immunity to the natural physiological consequences.
Of course this is nonsense, but that is what they say.
Let us first understand exactly what the two
great venereal diseases do to society. Syphilis de-
stroys the brains of a man and his children to the
first generation. About three times more men die
from syphilitic disease of the brain than women.
This may, of course, be due to the fact that men
have three times more brains than women, but I
doubt if “Q.E.D.” in her enthusiasm would admit
that theory. (You see, I dare to guess a “she” !)
More probably it is because syphilis is commonly, in
spite of what some people say, transmitted by the
prostitute, and one prostitute can infect many men
while she is contagious.
But if we are to introduce the subject of birth-
control into a purely medical question, at once the
wowsers will rise in their might, and nothing at all
will be done. “914” (B. 23/10/’24) is quite right
in saying that to protect a woman from V.D. is
anatomically impossible, and surely it is better to
protect one sex alone than none! In two genera-
tions without syphilis the human race would acquire
brains enough to see that contraception is absolutely
necessary, and that a woman should have the say
in' the matter as to whether she shall bear children
or no. Therefore, although I am fully alive to the
devastating effects of gonorrhoea upon women, its
deadly power of causing misery, pelvic pain and
sterility, I still think that syphilis is by far the
more important of the two, if only because it takes
away the brains of a man and his children, whereas
gonorrhoea sometimes prevents babies from being
born and makes them blind. If “Q.E.D.” can refer
me to any experiments on the living— not in the
laboratory —in any way comparable to the great
work of Metschnikoff and Calmette, I unreservedly
withdraw in her favor; but until it has been proved
that chinosol tablets — i.e., chinosol in a watery
solution—are an effective preventive of both syphilis
and gonorrhoea, I shall be content to hold that it is
wiser to aim at what is practicable and not stir the
wrath of the wowser so that we shall get nothing.
And does “Q.E.D.” think that a Customs Department
that would not even allow the importation of “Boc-

caccio” would ever allow the open importation
of contraceptive tablets? You can get calomel oint-
ment at any chemist’s.
I fully agree with both “Q.E.D.” and “914”
that the prevention of V.D. is the most important
problem before modern civilisation, if it is to remain
a civilisation; but surely it is better to aim at
what is practicable than, by grasping at too much, to
lose all.

A Mugs’ Game.
The London representative of Sydney Sun
was told the other day by “a leading autho-
rity on international exchange” that, “de-
spite official quotations, it is costing from 4
to 5 p.c. to transfer to Australia money
urgently needed there.” And, in a burst
of candor, the expert added that this nation
is “too much occupied with horse-racing and
politics and too little with business —that
is the fundamental cause of the present
crisis.” His theory is as good as another
and better than most. This much is certain
—that Australians are excessively interested
in trivial features of party and factional poli-
tics, that they have drifted into a demoralis-
ing habit of depending on legislators for
things they should do for themselves, and
that their passion for gambling on horse-
races has become dangerous to the nation.
Ridiculous to other nations also. Recently
an eminent Australian, perhaps the greatest
living anthropologist, returned on a visit
to N. S. Wales, his native State. But his
stay in Sydney coincided with that of Cor-
teen, a Melbourne plunger, and Godby, the
trainer who prepares Corteen’s coups; so
the man who really mattered was ignored
or dismissed in a few lines by newspapers
which devoted column after column (with
portraits) to the two gamblers. Last week
another distinguished Australian, now asso-
ciated with Vickers, Ltd., announced that
his firm was willing to combine
with the Broken Hill P'rop. in
manufacturing armor-plate and
other important steel products
at Newcastle. But about the
same time Corteen and Godby
were disqualified over the run-
ning of Purser, the Caulfield
Cup winner, and in the fierce
light that beat upon this im-
portant intelligence the Vickers
item, and the simultaneous re-
port that Henry Ford had de-
cided to establish five assembly
plants in Australia, shrank into
obscurity. For the decision of
the V.R.C. stipendiary stewards
involved all the horses racing
in the great Corteen’s colors,
one of which was Heroic, until
then favorite for the Derby and
Cup; in short, it “paralysed the
Melbourne Cup market.” The
Bulletin was glad to hear it.
This paper would rejoice to
learn that the Melbourne Cup
market, and the Sydney Cup
market, and those on the Aus-
tralian, Caulfield, Perth, Bris-
bane and Queensland Cups, and
on a swarm of Derbies and
handicaps, had been “para-
lysed” for all time. Of all the
follies to which amateur punt-
ers are addicted ante-post bet-
ting is the most stupid. Im-
mense sums are fooled away in
this fashion on horses which
the great majority of the back-
ers have never even seen. The
average ante-post punter gets a
false price about his fancy—
false, because the professional
gentry have got in ahead
of him and because the
embargo on the publication of prices plays
right into Mcßook’s hands. He has no
means of ascertaining at first hand whether
the animal is in a satisfactory condition
(there are trainers who can’t tell whether
a horse is short of work or has done too
much) or what its barrier position will be;
whether it is meeting steeds that have been
stiffened in previous races, and are there-
fore advantageously handicapped, or will be
stiffened itself. Such information as he
possesses is furnished at second hand by
horse-scribes who, in the nature of things,
can’t see everything that goes on in the
races they report, nor is what they are told
in betting clubs and elsewhere always true.
In effect, the mug-punter backs his ignorance
against the knowledge of the Godbys and of
Corteens and that of T. Mcßook. And if
his steed falls lame, or is scratched or rubbed
out, or belongs to an owner who is disquali-
fied over another quadruped’s performance,
he doesn’t even get a run for his money. It
is a pathetically futile business, but a multi-
tude of Australians engage in it to the detri-
ment of real business and real industry.
The manager of the Commonwealth shipping
line dropped a warning the other day that,
if the Labor bosses continue to mark out the
fleet for special annoyance, merely, it would
seem, because it pays the best wages and
conforms to the Labor ideal of national
ownership, said fleet will probably sell out.
It would be better, as no improvement seems
possible, if it sold out right off. A new fleet
could always be obtained if'some expert found
a way to make such a thing pay. There is
nothing more democratic or meritorious
about the maintenance of a Public Enter-
prise fleet merely to make billets for sea-
going men than there is in the maintenance of
a Public Enterprise (or Established) Church
to make jobs for men in black clothes. The
question is whether the fleet and the
church yield a profit, or render some service
which can’t be secured at least as cheaply
and of as good quality without adding ship
or church ownership to the State’s worries.
And there is nothing more to be said for
preference to unionists than for preference
to Anglicans unless the preferred persons
take the trouble to deserve their advantage.
The position as regards the Commonwealth
line is that it causes great loss, and gives
opportunity for much vexation, and yields no
promise of improvement in either respect—
in fact, as regards the vexation, the job-
control party expresses every hope that it
may manage to make the position much
worse. The latest unseemly jest is to the
effect that, in the hope of reducing the loss
somewhat—
It has been found advisable to tie up vessels in
Australia and charter British vessels for the out-
ward voyage from tlxe United Kingdom.
If a man owns a horse which is so expensive
that it is better to leave it idle in the pad-
dock and hire another man’s horse, it is
time for him to sell his horse.

hsiang’s seizure of the Chinese capital—
at an inducement of 2,000,000 dollars—re-
vives once more missionary hopes of the mass
conversion of China by imperial edict.
Asoka did it for India and Constantine
for Rome; so why not Feng for the feckless
millions of China? The Taiping revolt of
1850 was a similar attempt, which only
failed because the British Government in
the interests of British business lent to the
pagan Manchu rulers an extremely able sol-
dier, General Gordon, who huffed at the
proselytising rebels a couple of times and
blew them over, but not before they had
spread devastation over 13 provinces and
swept into eternity about 20 million people.
In Feng Cromwellian traits are uppermost.
His Ironsides, probably the finest troops in
China, mingle psalm-singing with machine-
gun practice, and get short.shrift when caught
looting. Feng lops bandits’ heads with the
nonchalance of a child pulling the legs off
grasshoppers, and he shocked the party poli-
ticians by beheading a rival general whom
he had defeated in one of the innumerable
campaigns of the present war. Not that the
Christianising of China, even if it were pos-
sible, would result in the inauguration of a
reign of peace around the shores of the
Pacific. The real inwardness of Feng’s
move from the Chinese viewpoint is that it
checks Japanese encroachment, threatened
by CnANG’s advance from Manchuria. The
rushing of a Japanese division to Tientsin,
the port of Peking, shows that Nippon’s states-
men appreciate this. In the meantime, Wu
Peifu, the Chihli general, is not yet disposed
of, so that the coup d’etat at Peking solves
nothing, and China, with Russia looking over
her shoulder, remains the most dangerous
powder-magazine of international politics—•
which is mostly built on powder magazines.

The proposal to widen George-street West,

expensive street widenings are to the advan-
tage of pedestrians. English law has always
regarded the person on foot as having the
right of the road; in theory it is the
business of a driver to hold back and give
him time and opportunity to cross. As, how-
ever, the police have forgotten this, the
ancient theory does not greatly help the
pedestrian. Nominally the motor-car is still
not allowed to run him down; but it does
not matter very much what is or is not
allowed when he is under the wheels. The
effect of street-widening has invariably been
to increase the speed of the wheeled traffic;'
and the wider streets give the pedestrian less
chance than those which are narrower.
Oxford-street, Sydney, has become a death-
trap since the wider space gave the chance
for faster driving; Pitt and Castlereagh
streets, though narrow and congested, are
comparatively safe through the rule which
keeps all vehicular traffic moving in one direc-
tion. The remedy, if widening must be
done, lies in doing the job so thoroughly that
a safety zone—planted with trees, if pos-
sible—could be left in the centre, with the
wheels divided into two streams. London,
with its innumerable “islands,” has adopted
a modification of this plan, with the result
that it is safer for the average person to cross
the big city’s Oxford-street than Sydney’s ex-
panse of the same name, though the latter
carries certainly not one-twentieth of the
other’s traffic. But the chances are that
when a city has grown up as crooked in shape
as a Freetrade argument it may pay better
to make new streets than to widen old ones.
Birmingham tried it many years ago and has
had no cause to regret it.

A curious turn has been given to the dis-
cussion of the N. S. Wales Nc Temere Bill
by certain remarks of the Presbyterian
Moderator which show what a very long
arm is sometimes behind the dead hand of
the past. On the ground that the West-
minster Confession—a seVenSeenth-century
document which the English Puritans framed
—is opposed to certain clauses in the mea-
sure, the Moderator throws the chief sec-
tarians of the Fuller party into the wrong
camp! With their whole thought centred
on what they are pleased to call the Scarlet
Woman, they have forgotten the old blue
dame that once walked with tight-drawn
lips and has never ceased to say her say in
English lands. The Westminster Confession
is a remarkable document. It was an at-
tempt made in a mathematical age to reduce
the creed of Calvin to such accuracy of
storm-proof logic that it never could be
assailed; and, considering the premises from
which it works, it does hang together, state-
ment and Scriptural proof, very much like
a book of Euclid. But does modern Pres-
byterianism really live upon that old creed?
Does its Moderator still cling to all the
theory of an arbitrary God damning the
greater part of mankind for His mere good
pleasure? Do practical Scotchmen, who
write “Presbyterian” on their census cards,
hold that it is a sin to marry a deceased
wife’s sister or a deceased brother’s wife?
Is it not rather a fact that Presbyterian
ministers in signing the Confession do so
because there is a conscience clause added
which enables them to interpret—that is,
explain away—the whole book according to
their own views ?

The Commission which is to govern Can-
berra has been appointed, and has had its
portraits in the papers, and has taken off its
coat and got to work. It has powers to builds
to dig, to drain, to borrow, to tax and to
hustle, and organs like the S. M. Herald
hope, in a rather lugubrious and perfunctory
way, that its labors will be so blessed that
the next Federal Parliament will meet there
before its life is done. This is the orthodox
thing to say, for the capital represents the
last faded laurel of the old Freetrade
parochialism, and the old gang hardly cares
to say righj; out that it was a durned fool
of a laurel even when new. ’Berra stands
for Ma State’s victory over the hated Pro-
tectionists of Melbourne, who had “en-
trapped” Ma into the Federal movement, and
in those days, when the Sydney Telegraph
used to specifically curse Victorian perfidy
14 times in one issue, any small success
counted. Now the Telegraph and Herald
would as soon wear crinolines in the street
at noon as write any of the silly old articles
about the abstract beauties and divine origin
of Freetrade in which they once revelled, and
the special Melbourne-curser which each
paper used to keep on the premises has been
pensioned off. There was some truth in
somebody’s recent remark that “nobody
really cares 2d. for Canberra now except
Austin Chapman, and lie lives
at Maroubra.” The idea of
there being somehow a large
profit for Ma in the business
(Ma being understood to mean
Sydney) has mostly flickered
out. Sydney lost its chance of
being the Federal metropolis in
the complicated manoeuvres
which brought the new place
on to the map, and that is
about all.

Apparently the luck of the
Lee Government has descended
to Tasmanian Labor. In the
unexciting debate on Premier
Lyons’s Budget the only faults
of administration alleged by the
Opposition were imputed to
Albert Ogilvie, Attorney-
General. One was that he had
advised the Government to
square for £l2OO the £3OOO
claim preferred by ex-Railway
Commissioner Wishart Smith
without fighting the case out to
the bitter end. The other was
his suspension of police-magis-
trate Turner for “insubordina-
tion” or something. Ex-Trea-
surer Lee, now the only knight
in active Tas. politics, roundly
declared that it was common
knowledge that Smith, on
exalted legal opinion, was
anxious to come to terms be-
fore the case had been before
the courts more than a few
days, the inference being that
the Government would have
won the suit hands down.
Ogilvie merely says: “I know
all about that.” And as he is the
only lawyer in the Plouse it is to be pre-
sumed that he does know whether a law-
suit looks healthy or otherwise. Anyway,
he considers the £l2OO was a cheap settle-
ment for the Government. As to the police-
magistrate affair, Ogilvie’s case is that he
gathered from Turner’s letter to him that
lie (Ogilvie) was charged with using his
position as head of the Law Department to
screen or assist certain criminals, and he was
dashed if he would stand that from anybody.
Hence the suspension and the reinstatement
of the magistrate after he had assured his
chief that lie hadn’t meant the imputation.

This is the record of the U.S.A. Inquisition
for the Suppression of the Demon Drink
for the past years: 30,000,000 gallons
of liquor seized; 177,000 persons arrested,
94,300 convicted, and fines amounting to
18.000,000 dollars imposed; 95 people killed
during the past four years; wounded, so
many that count has been lost. Mrs. Wille-
brandt, Federal Assistant-Attorney, admits
that the thumb-screw and the stake have
failed to instil a respect for prohibition as
the one true god even into the inquisitors
themselves. Federal Attorneys and officials
who are too lukewarm in their persecutions
can’t be sacked, she says, because powerful
politicians protect them. Altogether, while
liquor in the old days undoubtedly debauched
a few weaklings, wholesale restriction seems
to have corrupted the civil service, degraded
the political life and debauched the society
of a whole nation.

POLITICAL
POINTS
Ramsay Macdonald’s Russian friends, the
uncouth men who run the Soviet show,
weren’t helpful to him during liis election
campaign. The warm-hearted fool who
made himself a world’s jest by proposing
to waste his country’s money in subsidising
savages might have at least expected grati-
tude and politeness in return, but he got
neither. Whether Zinovicff urged the Bri-
tish Communist party to wliite-ant the army
and navy or not, the exultant jeers of men
like Litvinoff must have made many non-
Bolshevik Laborites feel that they had
acquired strange and beastly bedfellows.
Four parties in Britain put up a single
Parliamentary candidate each, and the hum-
blest was the “Christian Pacifist” who stood
for the smallest constituency of all, the Uni-
versity of Wales. It is characteristic of the
decentralising ideas they have in the Cold
Country that Wales has colleges at Aberyst-
wyth, Bangor, Cardiff, Swansea and Lam-
peter, with, in three cases, cheap male and
female residential quarters attached. Yet the
place isn’t one-third the size of Tasmania.
Australia hasn’t got beyond the idea of one
seat of learning to each State. If a young
man or woman wants knowledge it says
“Flock to the city,” and that is only one
of the many ways that people are urged to
flock. Yet the wail about the evil of flocking
goes up to Heaven like the smoke from a fried
offering.
It is quite possible that Australia could
have settled the British elections, for its own
benefit and for Britain’s, if its Government
had been less long-suffering. If, when
Flimsy Macdonald declared that all prefer-
ence was dead-off at liis end, the Australian
Government had promptly replied “Same
here,” adding that it would gladly renew
negotiations with a Cabinet which had some-
thing to offer, J. Bull would have already
discovered that the Mac Ministry’s policy
didn’t pay. Latest figures showed that Aus-
tralia, as a buyer of Bull’s goods, was worth
Russia 13 times over, which is something to
argue with.
Another great Australian factory has gone
out of business—the hosiery mills at Red-
fern. Sydney—and 400 workers are idle.
Ever since the rush of finished or nearly-
finished goods from countries with depreci-
ated currencies swamped England, and Eng-
land began to pass oceans of the stuff on to
Australia under the absurd “preference to
Britain” law, concerns like this have been
in difficulties. The Government has negoti-
ated politely with Britain, and got no re-
dress. It was too polite to take redress by
abolishing the preference. And when at last
it reduced the preference it was too polite to
apply the reduction without long notice, lest
the fellow at the other end should be annoyed.
A Cup Week crisis is now a possibility
in Vic. State politics. The three Opposi-
tion sections are getting closer together, and
once an agreement is fixed up they will soon
send Prendergast about his business. The
main obstacle to an understanding is E armor
Allan’s hankering after the Premiership.
Then the Cockies and the five Liberals won t
have Argyle and Eggleston in a Composite
Government, though they wouldn t mind Law-
son as Treasurer or Attorney-General. How-
ever, Lawson is not an office-seeker 311 st
now. The matter of an indictment against
the Government will present 110 difficulty.
There are half a dozen counts in the pro-
McSliortodds Budget alone.
Nothing is so old that somebody won’t
discover it anew; consequently there appears
on the business paper of the Inter-State
Labor Conference at Melbourne a proposal to
issue notes secured on the assets within Aus-
tralia for all productive works.” Russia
and Germany lately repudiated paper curren-
cies of the sort and started new ones. There
are other samples, not quite so rickety as
the one proposed here, for they have some
fragment of gold reserve behind them, in
addition to being secured, in a general way,
on every object in the country. They have
a fluctuating value of sometimes Id. in
the shilling—that is to say, Is. worth of
them will buy a penn’orth of productive
works.
Not for many a day has there been such
a muster of members of Vic.’s Upper Cham-

out the Labor-cwm-Cocky Compulsory Wheat
Pool Bill. The whole 34 were accounted for.
Thirty votes were recorded—l 3 for and 17
against. Beckett (Honorary Minister), who
was away on a health trip, paired with
Davis, who is blind; Austin was ill, and
Frank Clarke sat in the chair. The only
hope for the bill was a thin attendance.
When McNamara, who was sponsor, saw the
drearies and wearies trooping in with the
regulars he lost heart, and went through
his task like a £4O-a-year curate who de-
spaired of a rise. I’rendergast’s oration over
the legislative corpse was not quite up to
the Mark Antony or Abraham Lincoln stand-
ard. but his party seemed satisfied.
In South Aus., as in Victoria and Queens-
land, there is to be less taxation for Labor’s
supporters (or those who are supposed to
be Labor’s supporters) and more for the other
side. The S.A. income-tax exemption is to
be raised to £2OO (from £150), with the
allowance for each child at £5O (formerly
£3O). The super-tax- goes up to one-third
(from one-fourth), and the £2OO exemption
vanishes as the income increases. Premier
Gunn, who is his own Treasurer, confesses
to “absorbing, a portion of the income-tax
affected by the Commonwealth remissions,”
but claims that anyone with' income up to
£750 p.a. (that is, anyone suspected of voting
for the right ticket) will be in a better posi-
tion than before. Taxation ought to be a
science, and in some countries it is. But
in Australia it is becoming a coarse method
of dispensing favors and, distributing punish-
ments.
From the Brisbane gallery:—
The Queensland Labor daily, which is never quite
certain whether its right (political) •or left (indus-
trial) boot pinches, has again, after a few weeks of
“being solidly behind all sections of the party,”
opened up the question of Premier Theodore’s true-
blue Laborism. It’s a matter of good and bad meat
this time. Abattoirs are demanded for Brisbane,
and the paper is “faced with the amazing fact that
our real obstacle is the Premier.” Not that Theo-
dore objects to abattoirs, but he ' does object to his
Government being ordered to find “immediately"’
money that can’t be found. ■ The Premier’s attitude
has delighted the Oppositions press, and is alleged
to have enraged his opponents in the “movement. "
but the rage of these gentry must have subsided,
or they are not really so influential as they thought
they were. At all events, Theodore boat their man,
Ferricks, for the Herbert pre-selection by a majority
much bigger than that of Fihellv 'in Brisbane or
Sharpe in Oxley, and both were regarded as cer-
tainties, whereas the big man’s contest was thought
to be in doubt.
Just 10 years ago, when the Westralian
wheat crops failed, the then Labor Govern-
ment appjinted an Industries Assistance
Board with instructions to give the distressed
cockies everything they wanted, wages in-
cluded. Now another Labor Government is
in office, and it has made the gloomy dis-
covery that, although capable farmers have
repaid the advances, a lot of the original
beneficiaries are still “on the Board.” But
the patience of that body ,is wearing out.
In its 1923-24 report it notes that 141 of
its clients were required to liquidate their
accounts by June 30 (a decision afterwards
modified), that 170 accounts involving a loss
of £52,614 had been finalised, that 202 pro-
perties “carrying a liability; to the depart-
ment of £145.616” had b§en left on its
hands, and that 15 selections on which £6204
had been lent “were found on inspection to
possess no security value.” The amount
owing by sundry debtors is £1,923,540, and
£1,109,531 advanced during the year is cost-
ing the country 6J per cent. All of which
proves, if proof were needed, that stupid Gov-
ernments which feed the land-fever of men
with no vocation for farming and with little
or no money spoil a multitude of lives and
disorganise their own finances.
The Queensland experiment of day sittings
is voted a success. It has resulted in more
work, less talk and much relief for press-
men, Hansard reporters and attendants.
There are a few “stalwarts” who haven’t
quite given up their bad habit of taking
hours to say dully what could be better said
in minutes, but as the memory of old times
fades even they are expected to improve.
By casting out Farthing’s Riot Damages
Bill the Vic. Leg. Assembly showed that it
had no sympathy with the attempt made by
some of Melbourne’s merchant princes to
screw £18,700 out of the Treasury for the
wild and woolly doings of last Derby Night.
That was the occasion when the J. Hops
went on strike, and the red fool-fury of the
Yarra broke loose. At first the claimants
suggested that £lOO,OOO would be a fair
thing, but gradually the amount got down
to £18,700. Prendergast, Peacock and Allan
joined with 23 other members to reject
the bill in which this sum was mentioned.
The agitators in the gallery looked as glum
as they felt; their whip must have been an
appalling amateur.
The conduct of Minister Pearce rises at
times to the status of an insult to the Com-
monwealth. Lately it was forced on the
public notice that the home for half-caste
children at Alice Springs (N.T.) is a shack,
with 30 young people huddled in one room
and 20 in another, with surroundings to
match. It was added that the grievance
was an old one and had been reported often.
The official reply came in due course: —
The bungalow is under the control of an experienced
matron... .It is proposed to erect a new bungalow
in a more suitable position. An amount was to be on
the Estimates last year, but difficulties arose and it
was not submitted to Parliament. Every care is
taken to see that the girls are properly cared for.
The evidence was that, as the doors couldn’t
be fastened and tile sleeping-rooms were open
to the street, care was out. of the question.
Anyhow, what were these “difficulties” which
arose to block a simple matter like this, and
how high did they rise, and what is the
absurdly overpaid Pearce paid for except
to put down difficulties?
The abolition of the position of Director
of Forests and the appointment of a Fores-
try Board should have good results in
Queensland. The Board has been appointed
provisionally for 12 months, and consists
of E. H. Swain, formerly Director of For-
ests ; A. Staines, an inspector of the Public
Service Commissioner’s Department; and
C. Paterson, the Forestry Engineer. This
Board will control the State forests and
national parks; but there is not even talk
of doing what U.S.A. proposes to do with
regard to private forests. As in Australia,
nearly four-fifths of Uncle Sam’s dwindling
stock of living timber is privately owned,
and the knowledge that famine is only 25
to 30 years away is forcing public opinion
towards coercive measures of development.
Some attempt should be made to get the
lotteries legislation of the States into line.
Victoria forbids a number of things that most
other States sanction, and yet there are some
stunts accounted legal in Victoria that even
Queensland would not tolerate, although its
Government openly conducts “art unions”
that are tabu in the Cabbage Garden. Only
the other day the Bananaland Government
fined two innocents £2O for conducting a
raceliorse-tipping competition similar to sev-
eral in Melbourne that are flourishing and
bringing in big profits to the promoters. A
Victorian newspaper may not publish an
advertisement about any of the art unions
or “caskets” run by or with the approval of
Governments in sister States, yet papers com-
ing into the State from outside, and circulat-
ing in every corner of it, are under no such
disability. The present absence of uni-
formity creates confusion, manufactures
criminals and brings law into contempt.
For the first time on record a non-Labor
Prime Minister has been praised, after a
fashion, in a Labor paper. Commenting on
the Parliamentary list of attendances for the
session, Sydney Worker acknowledges that
Bruce, by being present at every sitting, set
an example to some Labor members, one of
whom was the A.W.U.’s own Lambert,
M.H.R. for West Sydney. In the same issue
of the Worker Massey’s statement that the
White Maoriland policy will be maintained
in spite of a million European conferences
is quoted as an example to “many Australian
employers.” But the employer who opposes
the White Australia policy is a rarity nowa-
days. And his opposition is trivial compared
with that of the imported Gardens and
Walshes. and of those home-grown Labor
delegates who came under the fatal influence
of Tom Mann. llis latest outburst, by the
way. is an appeal to Moscow to Bolshevise
the Kaffirs.

“Mrs. Lance Rawson” : Swift courtships?
I once knew a station-overseer who undertook
to oblige a married neighbor by meeting a
lady-help coming by steamer and escort-
ing her to her destination. They had
27 miles to drive, and started from the
wharf at 9.30 a.m. Fifteen miles out they
were married by a travelling parson, and
continued the journey. The husband is still
satisfied that it was the best day’s work he
ever did in liis life. Again, I knew a widow
who went to the funeral of an unknown

three-weeks-old infant) on the way home.

“Hamer”: The genial atmosphere which
has enveloped this year’s Anglican Synod
in one Australian capital was spoiled to-
wards the end by a damp cloud of suspi-
cion. It was really an excellent Synod, at
which the remark of one parson that people
would be better Christians if they drank
more wine was greeted with applause, and
someone else remarked, w'ithout evoking a
protest, that he enjoyed having a financial
interest in a game of cards. But when one
of the two typewriting-machines which had
been lent to the Synod mysteriously dis-
appeared, the uncomfortable feeling that
someone had been carrying broad-minded-
ness too far fell on the gathering. The
gloom deepened when the accommodating firm

sent along a hurried request that the re-

plication being that the lenders had lost all
their faith in black-frocked gentlemen, and

“C.G.th”. tells Of a military Operation
•Where no V.C.’s wefe won
The Sefliissi bampaigii which
disturbed the tranquillity of the
Libyan Desert during 1916 gets
scant notice from the war his-
torians. Early in that year a
rabble of undisciplined desert
nomads had wandered in from
Tripoli and congregated at Dackla
oasis. For the most part they
were Haza Arabs, Siwans and
Soudanese deserters. Accompany-
ing them were a few mules, about
a thousand more or less diseased
dromedaries, a couple of antiquated
fieldpieces, and a heterogeneous
assortment of rusty shotguns.
Over this quaint outfit there pre-
sided an ambitious Mussulman
named Sayed Ahmed, who, muster-
ing his ragged army of 1400,
announced as his immediate objec-
tives (1) the invasion of Egypt,
(2) the extermination of the Brit-
ish Army of Occupation. To
counter these amiable aspirations
the Egyptian command proceeded
to erect a barricade of barbed-wire
and to establish a defence force of
infantry, flying corps, cavalry,
artillery and cameliers, most of
whom were assembled at lvharsa
oasis. At various points along the
Nile Valley other troops were
stationed, until nearly a quarter
of a million men were engaged in
resisting the projected advance of
Ahmed’s tattered warriors. I won-
der if military critics and com-
mentators will ever tell us why
the British troops were tied to a
policy of laissez-faire for nearly
12 months, with the enemy not 209
miles away, or what was the cost
to the country of this defence force
in rations alone ? Anyhow, the
fact remains that the Senussi were
left unmolested among the date-
palms of Dackla when a single
company of cameliers would have
scuttled them in 12 hours. Late
in ’l6 we received orders to attacK,
but when, we reached the Senussi
stronghold those of them who had
not dispersed appeared to have
perished of ennui, ’they left nothing but a collection
of garbage and a harem of hideous-looking females.

“True Bill” : Soon after the Common-
wealth’s first Tariff Act was passed, a johnny
presented himself at the inquiry counter of
the Customs House, Melbourne, and in-
quired the duty on lenses. The clerk
asked what kind —photographic, microscopic,
spectacle or n.e.i., which last stands for
“not elsewhere included” in the tariff. The
would-be importer eagerly caught at the
last. “That’s it,” he said, “ ‘n.e.i.’ ” He was
told to make up his entry, and returned in a
few minutes w'itli a document which read:
“One case lenses, any eye.” That amazing
scrap of paper went round the office, eventu-
ally reaching Charley Kingston, the Min-
ister. Those who knew him can imagine his
roar.
“Jake B.”: A parachute
descent from a burning
captive balloon was a more
frequent necessity than
“Be.aconsfield’s” par. (B.
9/10/’24) would suggest.
If everyone who had safely
accomplished the feat had
been given six months to
recruit his shattered nerves
half the Balloon Corps
would have been transferred
to England. Some parachu-
tists had the cruellest luck.
I remember one observer
who w y ent overboard after
his sausage had been fired,
and had almost reached the
ground when a puff of wind
carried the whole outfit into
the middle of Dickebuscli
Lake. He failed to extri-
cate himself from the tangle
of gear, and was drowned.
The sausages were more
often the prey of marauding
Fokkers and Albatrosses
than of the Hun artillery.
In the absence of effective
ground defences, our balloon
line was fairly easy money
for Hun scouts. Having
done the damage, they would
sometimes turn their atten-
tion to the descending para-
chutist, but more often they
were too intent on regaining their own lines.

“Ex-Englishman” : The controversy about
the eldest son often being physically the
feeblest of the family has a big and obvious
importance in England, from the bad custom
of giving him the title, all the land and most
of the money, while the stalwart juniors have
to go out and work. John Buchan’s “Path
of the King” is all on that theme: “The
things we call aristocracies and reigning
houses are the last places to look for master-
SEEING’S BELIEVING.
ARDENT SUITOR: “Let me prove by deeds that my lore
is genuine.”
MISS CAUTIOUS : “Have you got them with you?”
ful men.” But sex doesn’t matter, of course;
it is the eldest child, the pioneer, that suffers.
And chance—or Providence, if you please —
has so had it that to the throne of Britain an
eldest child singularly seldom succeeds. The
cause of the disability of the eldest? Obvious,
I think. Of the three possibles, the inexperi-
ence of the mother in caring for the child
can fairly be dismissed, as not likely to have
much result, in the case of royalty or wealth.
On the psychological side, the child of pas-
sion ought to be finer, not less fine, than
the child of custom (the old Greeks, who
regarded the subject with the unprejudiced
eye of a stock-breeder, were confident on
that point). There remains the physical
side —and it is sufficient. Any married man
will tell you that his wife was more fitted
to produce big children any time after the
first.
“Verri”: Speaking of surgical operations
by amateurs, a Sydney doctor will tell you
that the pluckiest he knows of was per-
formed on herself by the wife of a Sydney
sea-captain. She was on an extended honey-
moon tour in her husband’s schooner, which
put into one of the small islands of the
Friendly group to obtain a new mast. The
only passenger was a young medical student
recruiting after a nervous breakdown. All
hands except the cook had gone with the cap-
tain to help carry the mast several miles
over trackless country to the coast. The
lady, seeking shells on the reef, cut her great
toe, and realised, after several days of agony,
that mortification had set in. She appealed
to the student to remove the toe, and when he
funked the job, she borrowed his razor, re-
tired to her cabin, and without any anaesthetic
performed the operation herself. Three days
later the ship’s company returned. Mac.-
quarie-street eventually completed the re-
moval of the toe and congratulated the;
plucky patient on having saved her own lite..
“Double Up”: Since railway-manager
Clapp started sloganising (it is said that he;
puts aside all other business and wraps his.
head in a wet towel while lie thinks out
ear-tickling phrases), the habit lias caught
on throughout Victoria. Even a little sweet-
shop near my St. Ivilda habitat appeals for
custom with the sign “Melancholy t Try a
Lolly!” The “Eat More Cheese” week has;
been followed by noisy exhortations to all
and sundry to devour an increased quan-
tity of all sorts of things. But the
boosters of our great primary industries
aren’t having it all their own way. A Mel-
bourne publican has got in early with Are
you gloomy—short of cheer l Take advice
and Drink More Beer!” And I hear of a
suburban church committee which has re-
ceived an offer from one of the members of
the tabernacle, a painter, to put up free of
cost a signboard :
The Devil will leave you in the Lurch,
Be on the safe side —Come to Church.
“Blink Bonnie” : If the persons concerned
didn’t exaggerate, the undertaker called dur-
ing 1923 for 25 Australian centenarians, of
whom 13 were men. Only one was native-
born ; 10 came from England, and nine from
Ireland; Scotland, Germany, the Canary
Islands, Greece and China contributed one
apiece. Three of the men died bachelors,
but all the ladies had been married. All the
men save one had followed arduous occupa-
tions ; and with three or four excep-
tions all had lived and died outside
the big cities. The statistical departments;
of the different States do their best to verify
allegations of exceptional longevity, but
as the compulsory registration of births and
deaths dates practically from 1874 (the 1836
Act was faulty) it isn’t always possible to
do much in that way.

“Jcobb”; When I was an assistant at
the Working Men's College in Melbourne,
Frank Anstey. now deputy-leader of the
Federal Opposition, was an attendant whose
duties included sweeping the classrooms and
showing the knowledge-seekers to their
apportioned spheres. Our present King,
then Prince of Wales, was due to open the
Commonwealth’s first Parliament. The city
was gay with bunting, but the huge flagstaff
on the Bowen-street building poked a bare
head skywards, the rotten rope having been
carried away as the caretaker attempted to
unfurl the flag. Director Campbell was
frantic over the mishap, and Anstey with 1
his nautical knowledge was besought to hoist
the necessary symbol. He agreed to get an
old sailor-mate and tackle the job for a
stated sum. Half a dozen of us raced up
the tower to view' the proceedings. At the;
first attempt Anstey got up some 10 of the 40-
odd feet that stood above the fancy ironwork
THE SETTLEMENT.
“The young cub wanted me to settle a thou-
sand pounds on him for life.”
“What did you do?”
“Weighed myself and promised to go and
live with him.”
which supported the huge stick —a slip on
to those spikes would mean instant death.
Gazing Heavenwards, Frank decided that
the risk was worth an addition to the con-
tract price; and a hasty conference conceded
the demand. Another 20-foot climb brought
him into the view of the prisoners in the
old labor yard, who greeted his ascent with
a lusty cheer, in which the guards joined.
By this time the Ophir was in the bay ; but
there was another liold-up for an increase
before the pole was topped and the flag
waved its welcome. Frank Anstey has
climbed a lot since then, but I doubt if the
pay has ever been better or the cheering
more spontaneous.

“Schnorrer”: There is one Jewish festival
which the kiddies who live in the neighbor-
hood of devout Hebrews have learnt to
appreciate. The Feast of Tablernacles, or
Succotli, now just past, celebrates the wan-
derings of the Israelites in the wilderness,
and in every synagogue, and in the gardens
of most Jewish houses, a “succah” is erected
7 —a kind of arbor of greenery, decorated
inside with flowers, palms and fruit, and,
in these modern days, with balloons. On
Hosha’anna Eabba the children are enter-
tained in the succah with reminders of the
plenty the Israelites found even in the wilder-
ness. Last year the communal succah in

“ Darling, what is it?”
WIFE: “Oh, Harold, you're too late! Baby had its big
toe in its dear little mouth. It did look so funny.”
the yard of the Eastern Suburbs Synagogue
at Bondi Junction (Sydney) was raided;
and the marauders left little for young
Rachie and Issie. This year the succali of
a private Jewish family in Melbourne suf-
fered in the same way. But the climax
had a touch of humor about it. The house
of a policeman was handier to the ransacked
place than the police-station; so an urgent
message was sent to him. It failed, how-
ever, to bring him to the scene. He was
a Cohen, lie explained, and having obtained
leave of absence to observe a religious holi-
day, must not do any ordinary work.
Newlywed”: The other day I had occa-
sion to produce our marriage certificate to
the Had in the presence of Sophy. The
old man, having examined the formal docu-
ment, said: "So that’s what they give you
nowadays—humph!” and then toddled off
to Ins bedroom and returned with a little
silk envelope. On _____
the ' address side
was embroidered a
heart enclosing two
entwined initials.
I recognised the
fine needlework of
the dear old mater,
dead many years.
“That’s what your
mother and I got,”
he explained as he
drew out a time-
discolored docu-
ment. “S h e
always kept it in
the camphor-box.”
So these were the
“lines” of olden
days! An ornate,
heading with many
florid scrolls an-
nounced that it
was a “Marriage
Certificate.” In
the centre was the
picture of a church
with a very high
steeple and a wind-
ing pathway lead-
ing to the Gothic
door: to the left of
the document a
heavily-lettered in-
junction from Holy
Writ: “Husbands,
love your wives
and be not bitter
against them.” To
the right: “Wives, submit yourselves unto
your own husbands as it is fit in the Lord.”
“Well, I never!” said Sophy—“the impu-
dence !”
“Myall” : Apropos the recent passing of Cobb
and Co.’s coaches (B. 2/10/’24). On the occa-
sion when the last of these historic vehicles
started with its last mail from Surat to
Yeulba (Q.), with Fred Thompson handling
the ribbons, a little group of old hands came
along to bid farewell to the coaching days.
On the road to Yeulba the coach passed the
dwellings of two of Cobb’s old-time drivers,
Jimmy Davidson and Dave Teys. What
memories must have awakened as they
turned out for a last inspection of the
team and heard the final crack of the whip
as the lurching old vehicle faded away in a
cloud of dust!
“C.G.C.” : Not all balloon-
ists took to their parachutes
with alacrity in time of peril
(B. 9/10/’24). In the Sal-
onika war-zone a number of
captive sausages were em-
ployed for artillery observa-
tion. One morning a highly-
placed official, corpulent, dig-
nified and on his first visit to
the Front, essayed an aerial
trip in company with two
observers. They had not
been up long when a Fritzie
’plane sailed over, and a few
spurts set the sausage
aflame. All three occupants
were equipped with para-
chutes, and the blazing gas-
bag above was a strong
argument against procrasti-
nation. But the passenger,
terror-stricken at the pros-
pect of a plunge through air,
resolutely declined to drop
over. Promptly the observ-
ers picked up the portly
gentleman, attached his para-
chute and unceremoniously
heaved him into space. All
three alighted safely.

“Henry Pannikin”: Among
determined methods of sui-
cide the one adopted by a
navvy on the Tweed-Lismore
(N.S.W.) line will take some
beating. He had been drink-
ing hard, and looking around
for a way out of his troubles
saw a pile-driver at work on
a River wharf.
u , ~ After gazing at the huge
monkey, a ton in weight, dropping
about 30 feet, he took his decision and placed
his napper on top of the pile as the “driver”
was about to descend.

“Clifford S.”: A story told lately in a
criminal court at Bendigo suggested the
doings of some small but double-dyed Rhine
baron in the days when barons were a law
unto, themselves. The parties were “on the
land in the mallee. James Stephens mar-
ned one of the Murfin sisters when she was
-Lu. feiie lett nim after seven years owing to
various acts, one of which consisted in mak-
ing her lie down while he drove a cart over her.
The other sister alleged that she was Ste-
phens’s mistress, having been terrorised into
assuming that position at the age of 15. Ill-
feeling of a high-handed and baronial sort
on the part of Stephens pervaded the scene.
One of the Murfin boys died through a fall

off liis horse, the local legend having it that
he was really pushed off by his brother-in-
law. The Murfin house was burned, and it
was generally believed that the brother-in-
law held the match. The remaining boy
lived in concealment, more or less; but a
time came when he was 19, and being rushed
by his relative on horseback, and happening
to have a gun, and the gun happening to go
off, and the hostile relative happening to
linger too long in front of the muzzle, there
was an end of the one-sided feud. The jury
acquitted right off. During the years over
which these happenings spread there was
doubtless a policeman in the vicinity, and an
elderly J.P. or two, and a certain weight of
public opinion ; still the people on the land
fended for themselves very much after the
style of the Middle Ages.

"Douglas Drinkhard”: The Rev. A.
Harris, a Melbourne Baptist, has been de-

ing that “so many people fell into it that
it was a wonder the authorities.... did not
fill it up.”

We’d dive and leap in merrily ;
The gardens would become a surge
Of millions swarming to the verge.
Oh, image of celestial cheer!

“Sturt”: The Art Gallery of Adelaide has
had a scare over perhaps its finest picture,
"Love and Death,” by Watts. A slight rot
developed a year or two ago in a corner of
the canvas, and on expert advice the pic-
ture was sent to London for treatment, which
was in due course reported to be effectual.
It has now returned, having acquired on the
voyage a healthy growth of fungus all over
the back, and to some extent on the front
also. Prof. Osborne, who looks after botany
at Adelaide Uni., describes it as a mildew
very familiar to him in his Manchester Uni-
versity days, when he found it constantly
affecting fabrics shipped to India. Warmth,
moisture and darkness help its growth, and
it is hoped that the dry air of Adelaide will
put a stop to it. The plants—for that is
what they are—could be killed outright, pro-
bably. with some form of absolute alcohol;
but that would be too great a risk to take
with the picture.

“R. Duppe”: A deputation that com-
plained to Vic. Premier Prendergast of the
methods of registry offices instanced the
case of a man in the country who asked to
be supplied with a young and capable house-
keeper, and received an elderly person who
was subsequently found to be insane. Some-
how I am reminded of the new cook who
arrived in our boarding-house with excellent
credentials. The boarders had just decided
that she was a dashed fine cook, when a
flying plate, which only just missed the head
of a passing aristocrat who occupies a front
room, gave us our first introduction to her
peculiarities. For two days culinary uten-
sils were dodged by the excitable lady’s co-
workers, and even we boarders who have
to traverse the vestibule between the kitchen
and dining-room found the course perilous.
The cook was removed for observation on
the third day; and then a wave of horror
swept over the household—an excited ’phone
message arrived that she had claimed to
have put poison into all the food in the
house before leaving. The boarders had
only just concluded dinner, and we spent an
unhappy evening awaiting developments, or
seeking to forestall the same by obvious
methods, and comparing symptoms. But I
suspect it was only the mad lie of a slightly
deranged female seeking to be revenged on
the establishment that had failed to appre-
ciate her: anyhow, there were no fatalities
—I am almost sorry to say.

“Bildad”: England’s alpine enthusiasts
propose to try their luck with Mount Everest
once more, next year or in 1926. The great
mountain can’t be visited by aeroplane and
made a regular calling place, as may happen
with the North Pole, for a vessel which
landed in that rarefied atmosphere would
have no lifting power to get away with. The
whole tremendous effort is to enable one
party to pay one momentary visit, after
which the subject will presumably drop. If
the matter is really worth while, which I
doubt, it might be better to attack the
monster by internal spiral staircase. The
stair would wind up and up till a hole like
an eye appeared overhead, and the topmost
argonaut would put his head through and
see the world at his feet. Air-holes would
have to be bored at intervals through the
side of the mountain, but though these would
add to the expense they would improve the
atmosphere. This sort of conquest would be
permanent unless the spiral road collapsed;
in fact, picnic parties might be able to go to
the top daily.

“Quiz”: A big, burly man, obviously a
Cup visitor, laboriously stuttered an in-
quiry to the smaller chap, a stranger, seated
in the train beside him, as to how many
stations it was to Elsternwick. The other
made no answer. After the big individual
had left the compartment at Elsternwick
somebody curiously asked the unresponsive
one why lie hadn’t supplied the desired in-
formation. “Der-der-yer th-th-ink I-I-wus
1-1-ook-in’ fer-fer tut-tut-trub-b-ble?” was
the illuminating answer.
“Buttinsky”: “Mepliisto’s” par. on per-
sonal auras and their visibility through a
screen of dreyanin (B. 16/10/’24) has left
me wondering if some genius has discovered
a variation of a certain revealing ray I was
introduced to in my youth. This consisted
of a secret substance between two glasses,
carefully masked off and leaving an aperture
of about a quarter of an inch. A hand or

lead-pencil viewed through it showed bones
or lead quite convincingly. Unfortunately
I tried it on a poker, and that, too, had a
skeleton. The scientific aspect immediately
faded; the “secret substance” between the
two sheets was a feather.

Doubtless helps him to acquire his
Fascinated avian love.
Poet souls may thrill at viewing
The cravat he wears for wooing
But he bores me with his cooing,

His ingratiating capers let him cut;
Eminence he must surrender
In the glad sartorial splendor
Calls of Spring (and sex) engender
In the knut.

Fragrantly assert the season,
And I’m quite aware it’s treason
To the Bible, unconcealed,
Hinting kings in robes the frilli-
est (or bucks in Piccadilly)
Are a patch upon the lily
Of the field.
What if Solomon the thesis couldn’t rebut,
Anil his clobber failed the eye to fill and glut,
Those are times remote and hoary ;

Now the tailor’s crowning glory
Is the knut.

All about you of the vernal
If you tread your round diurnal
’Mid “the love of wind and wing” ;
Where the flower in evidence is
And the creeper on the fences
To impress upon your senses
That it’s Spring.
But the prettiest pansies from parterres

And the verdure of the greens where

And the courting dove’s displayment
Tell me mating ties are clamant
No more clearly than the raiment

A week or so ago the directors turned the
key in the factory door; and now there are
only two questions for those interested: (1)
What are the prospects of re-opening? (2)
What will he got out of the wreck? As to
the first, the wheels may turn again; but
other people will be on the box seat. The
co., which was an amalgamation of four
milling concerns, wanted the public's money
for expansion, but apparently didn't want the
public to reap the harvest of success. So.
instead of share capital, debenture capital
was raised; and presently the A.B.C. got
in ahead even of the debenture-holders. The
position on June 30-was:
A.B.C.’s Ist Debentures .. £111,037
2nd Ditto, with interest . . 108,333
“C” Ditto, with interest . . 109,167
The 2nd and “C” debenture-holders were a
rather sympathetic lot; and a few months
ago they made large concessions. But it
was no good. The business wasn’t showing
profits, and the debenture-holders saw their
good money going after the bad. The assets
will therefore be realised. And that brings
us to the second question. First, the bank
wants its £111,037. To pay it there are:—
Stock £121,847
Book debts .. . . . . 36,263
Cash etc., less current accounts 4,220
Freeholds . . . . . . . . 85,979
Leaseholds .. . . . . 12,346
Plant, etc 213,669
Stock may bring in £70,000 and book debts
£35,000; total 105,000. The cash, etc., is
mostly etc.; so the three lines will hardly
pay off the bank. That will leave the
plant, freeholds and leasehold for the other
debenture-holders (£217,500). On paper
these things are worth £311.994. What they
will fetch is a gamble. This paper’s in-
quiries don’t lead it to expect that more than
one-fourth of the book value will be netted
if there is a breaking-up sale. And there is
a lesson in that for people who think the
only goodwill in a business is the amount set
out under that heading. Suppose this page
got an idea for extracting gold from cucum-
bers, and floated a £lOO,OOO co. for the pur-
pose, £25,000 of it being goodwill—the
precious idea, to wit. And suppose the co.
then spent £50,000 on special plant. When
the thing smashed most of that £50,000
would be goodwill, too. In fact, it would all
be goodwill but for the scrap value of some
of the plant. Somebody may in this case
take over all or some of the plant and run
it. The people who are most concerned about
that are the 2nd and “C” debenture-holders.
They might easily make ado of it. With
the whole of the share capital gone, and
with the bank burden lifted (although it might
be necessary to get some concession there in
order to hold on to some of the stock), the
risk should be worth taking. For there is
a market; and things are going to be bettor
for such cos. than they have been under our
old appalling system of preference to
j-British goods. The old failure is no cri-
terion. It was a bungled business from the
start. The people who ran it didn’t even
know how to,sell their goods. There is a
distinct chance for the debenture-holders —a
far better chance than will come from sell-
ing the concern piecemeal.

From the point of view of security the inves-
tor has just about all he can ask for here.
Two things that might ordinarily disturb
him don’t count in this case. 1 irst, the
comparatively weak reserves: second, the
prefs.’ comparatively small backing ot ordi-
nary capital. (There are £200,000 of 6 p.c.
first profs., £400,000 of 7 p.c. second prefs.
and £394,415 of ordinaries.) But reserves
are not always put in the show window. lor
instance, this co. acquired a large part of
its city property when Sydney was little
more than a good-sized village, with land
values to match ; and its freehold and plant
must be now worth far more than the
£627,950 at which they figure. All the
extra value is not only so much more re-
serve, but also so much more backing for
capital of both sorts. Though written out
of the accounts, goodwill is also worth more
than any collection-plate will hold in Sydney
next Sunday. After providing for mortgages
and other debts there are liquid assets
(including stock) almost equal to the pref.
capital. This leaves nearly the whole of
the value of the freehold to the good. As. to
the capacity of the business to earn the divi-
dends, prefs. now take £40,000 a year; and
even before the war, when the capital was
less than half wdiat it is now, the profits
were more than £40,000. There is no great
margin of disclosed profit after paying the
ordinaries their 10 p.c.; but almost every-
thing depends on the stocktaking. If there
isn't anything to be gained by showing a
large surplus, a vigorous blue pencil can do
a lot on stock sheets running into half a
million ; and probably it has been busy
here. Every line of the balance-sheet sug-
gests solidity and a long run of prosperitv:—

The stock valuation is lower than it has
been for several years past; cash and invest-
ments are steadily climbing; liabilities are
very small in comparison with stock, and
suggest that buying is done on the best pos-
sible terms; and the increase of book debts
is no greater than one would expect in times
when many a customer has an expensive
motor-ear and a bank-manager who has lost
some of his old geniality. Concurrently
there is vigor in the management: the energy
with which it went into the wireless business
showed far-sightedness, too.

The decision of the South Aus. Irrigation
Commission to abandon its programme on the
Murray owing to the collapse of the dried-
fruits market hit this co. hard. Anticipat-
ing contracts aggregating £3.000,000, the co.
established in 102.1 a huge pipe-making plant
at Cobdogla. Now, after having handled one
lone contract —in connection with the Love-
day scheme—amounting to £255.000, the
plant has had to be pulled down and the
useful parts sent to other working centres.
The accounts show a year's net trading pro-
fit of £3B,SOS: and the difference between
that and the figure given in the table is
mostly accounted for by the under-estimated
cost of the -Lovcday contract. £13,439, and
repairs to contracts from the original co.,
£7635. The year simply bristled with
troubles. The Maoriland business, re-pur-
chased in 1923. was expected to show quick
results; but, although £60.000 of business
had been contracted for, work was not ad-
vanced sufficiently to benefit the accounts, and
£2038 of the establishment expenses have
been capitalised. Another co. had acquired
the Hume rights outside Australia. Maori-
land, S’Africa and India; but as this Eng-
lish co. apparently hasn’t the energy of the
Australian co. the latter has made certain
arrangements for handling the business in
America and other “unhypothecated terri-
tories.” Meantime, the co. is, on the other
hand, negotiating to buy back the Indian
rights with a view to floating an Australian
co. to work that territory. Efforts are also
being made to buy back the N. S. Wales
rights from the State Government, or to
operate the process on a royalty basis. The
Singapore subsidiary gave the parent a div.
of 12* p.c.: its holding in this is 10,000
fully-paid £1 shares. During the term Hume
Steel, Ltd., was floated to hjandle further
patents of W. R. Hume’s connected with
improved steel pipes. The £50,000 of pref.
capital asked for was subscribed by Hume
Pipe shareholders, and the co. was given
165,000 fully-paid £1 ordinaries. A contract
of £lOO,OOO was signed before the co. was
floated, and now the report is that so much
work is available that additional capital will
be necessary. The parent co. also expects
to do a good deal of business in concreting
steel pipes: it claims that this process will
indefinitely prolong the life of worn mains,
such as those of the Westralian Goldfields
service.
The following comparison is from the com-
mencement of the business:—
1921. 1923. 1924.

Cash, etc 17,178 25,868 27,499
Shares in other cos. 46,825 60,504 57,170
Altogether on June 30 there were tangible
assets £410,811 in excess of liabilities; add
£16,939 for calls since got in, making all
the shares fully paid, and bringing the capi-
tal to £500,000. That would give each share
about 17s. But half of it is in plant and
other fixtures whose value depends upon its
capacity to make profits; and the extent of
that capacity is at present in some doubt.
Their very merits are in one way a demerit.
When Snips builds a suit of clothes for a
man, he has a fair chance of building another
in half a year. But when this co. has fitted
a customer with a Hume pipe that's practi-
cally the end of the business.

Just an ordinary man may make one girl
happy; but it takes something like genius
to make a dozen happy, one after another,
under vastly different conditions. Wright,
Heaton’s management has that genius. One
change after another has occurred in the
country life of N. S. Wales, and this co. has
reorganised itself to meet the movement. Once
it was merely a carrier and in a small way a
produce salesman. But its country branches
are no longer perched in railway yards with
a shed somewhere in the vicinity for storage
purposes. They are mostly housed substan-
tially in Main-street now. The co. has so
many hens laying for it in so many nests
that pretty often when it has counted the
eggs the total has seemed too numerous to
be true. “No. they can’t be good,” _ the
cautious management has said, and has quietly
slipped a few handfuls into cold storage to
provide for the contingency. But such a
surprisingly large number have turned out
good that repeatedly the management has
had to do something to prevent the cold store
bursting. The table which began these re-
marks shows more than one of these opera-
tions ; and if you could look into the store
now you would probably find it pretty full—
four years ago it was admitted that there
was £40.000 tucked away, and, since then,
only £20,000 has been brought into the
accounts.
The co.'s position on paper has varied as
follows during the past 10 years:—

This co. owns all the shares in the McCul-
loch Co., which carries on the same sort of
business in Victoria. Book debts can be
accepted as superfine; when the directors
say that “as usual all ascertained bad debts
have been written off and ample provision
made for any doubtful debts and contin-
gencies.” one can be sure that not much in
that lot has been left to chance. Perhaps
the real question in a case of this sort is:
Can it go on? And to that one can only say
that of course any business can go on indefi-
nitely—if it maintains a management that
knows how to adapt the business to ever-
changing conditions. But it is not the sort of
business that can go very far without man-
agement. In other words, it is not a business
whose goodwill should be valued highly. But
of solid assets there is £5 4s. worth for every
50s. share; and the best recent buyer in the
market has been £5 ss. Tie wasn’t allowing
much for undisclosed assets.

Foggitt and Jones began in a small way in
Brisbane; and, partly by binding their work-
people to them with something stronger than
a pay-sheet, they made such progress that
three years or so ago they had to look for
outside capital to make the plant and other
extensions which orders called for. And
then Foggitt and Jones did a perfectly char-
acteristic thing: they set a value upon their
name and their undertaking less than the
circumstances justified. Hence the foregoing
table, showing that of £140,692 profit made
by the business in the past 34 years no less
than £55.150 has been left in the concern after
shareholders have had a shade over 9 p.c.
p.a. The capital got in upon flotation (the
office is in Melbourne) allowed the directors
to greatly reduce the liabilities; but busi-
ness expansion has eaten up a lot of money,
and it looks as though some more share capi-
tal wouldn’t come amiss :

Shareholders have, however, got hold of such
a good thing that not much in the way of a
plum is likely to be thrown to the outsider.
Everything seems to be favoring concerns
of this kind—even the disposition of the city
to live in flats, where it is so much more
convenient to buy something ready to eat
in a tin.

There has been a much larger addition to
general reserves; but £132,770 of it is an
amount spent on new plant prior to June 30.
1922. This paper won’t swear, though, that
either the £749,000 or the £736,000 is true
profit. No man living knows how much
(if any) of the net revenue of a mining co.
over any particular period is true profit. All
that can be said in this case is that there
are 336,185 tons less ore in the mine than
there were when the year opened; and no-
thing that the Baillieus can do in Melbourne,
with Clark and Robinson helping them in
London, can put back one ton of it. An
astonishing fact, nevertheless, is that the
ore reserves have not shrunk during the
year. Twelve months ago the directors esti-
mated that there were 824.000 tons in the
then newly-acquired British, and general-
manager Geo. Weir figured on 2,500,000 tons
in the North —the former above the No. 12
level; the latter above the 1400 ft. level.
Since then much work has been done below
1400 ft. in the North; and “the ore reserves
proved to date may be safely estimated at

years’ time. The volume of flow from Pioneer Wood
Pipe is initially some 15 to 20 per cent, greater
size for size than from metal pipes, and this flow
remains constant. While metal pipes rust and
tuberculate, and gradually choke up with accumula-

PERPETUAL TRUSTEE COMPANY (LtJ.)
33 TO 39 HUNTER STREET, SYDNEY.
Directors: Hon. Reginald J. Black, M.L.C. (Chairman) ; T. H. Kelly, Sir Samuel Hordern,

HAVE YOU MADE YOUR WILL?
THIS COMPANY is Specially Qualified
to Act as EXECUTOR AND TRUSTEE.
Among its advantages arc SECURITY, CONTINUITY OF MANAGEMENT
(it does not die), ACCESSIBILITY (it is always available to its clients),
EXPERIENCE (it, has handled almost every class of asset), its CHARLES*
ARE MODERATE.
Trust Funds' now under the Company’s control exceed £23,683,000.

3,750,000 tons, which figure should be materi-
ally increased as development of the looUtt.
level proceeds.” That is m the North. There
is a body of ore there which runs the diction-
ary out of adjectives. Where it has been
stabbed by a crosscut it is 191 ft. wide-
very nearly wide enough to lay down three
cricket pitches, if the directors feel like put-
ting it to a new use—and the average value
is 15.3 p.c. lead, 9oz. silver and 12.6 p.c.
zinc. The past year’s profit was made out
of ore averaging 14.3 p.c. lead, S.loz. silver
and 11.5 p.c. zinc. Without finding any more
ore (and that is an absurd proposition, of
course) the mine could feed the plant for
more than 11 years, running at last years
speed.
Frankly, it is not much use taking notice
of the figures showing the financial reserves
given ab0ve—£1,299,051. The share capital
is now £700.000, and the debenture debt
£92.400; and £850,981 of that and the re-
serves is represented by mine, property and
plant, and £427,945 by shares in other cos.;
and the latter is largely plant, too, depending
for its value upon this and other mines. Still
the position of the co. in hard cash or as
good as cash is wonderfully strong. Not
counting in shares as liquid (for the good
reason just mentioned), and excluding the
debenture debt from the liabilities, the sur-
plus of liquid assets on June 30 was
£799,148. as against £532,454 12 months pre-
viously. Since June 30 a dividend of £105,000
has been paid; you can please yourself
whether you count that in with the year’s
dividends or not. If it is included it makes
the return for the year 55 p.c. Those
figures are worth far more than the others.
As a matter of fact, though the mine at the
moment is worth much more than the book
value, the plant is in at cost, and these
plants live pretty fast lives even under the
most respectable management. From that
point of view the profit is over-stated; some-
thing must be written off against deprecia-
tion.
If anyone can tell The Bulletin what
tlie future of the metal markets will be, it
will be able to offer a much more definite
opinion about the future of the B. H. North.
There was a time when the mine was prac-
tically abandoned; Hal Sheppard and his
friends got it for as many thousands as
this co. now makes in a week. Certainly no-
body guessed then that there was 200 ft. or
so of ore at 1550 ft. But just as certainly
there would have been a strait-jacket for the
man who guessed that in 1924 lead would be
worth £37. silver 2s. lid. and zinc £33 18s.
9d. Of course you can read reasons why
those prices arc realised ; but they are not a
bit convincing. The only sure thing is that
they exist; and the quicker cos. like this get
out their ores and sell them the surer they are
of getting those prices. It almost makes
one shudder to remember that in the half-
year before the war, when metals were sup-
posed to be booming—and really were —lead
averaged £lB 145., silver 2s. 4d. and zinc
about £2O. How much a variation of £1 per
ton for lead alone means to this co. it is
hard to say, but it can be set down at
£40,000 per annum at least.
* * * •
The high charge for transferring proceeds
of sales from London to Australia is caus-
ing the Gold Producers’ Association much
anxiety. The directors report that the ex-
penses are now dangerously near the point
at which it will be unprofitable to export the
metal.
Great Boulder has not had the best of luck
lately. Its search in Canada for something-
good has proved unsuccessful; developments
in its old producer at Boulder have been
scarcely worth noting, and its recent pur-
chases —the Hannans North-Golden Zone
mines at the north end of Ivalgoorlie—have
proved not nearly as valuable as anticipated.
These properties were bought on the supposi-
tion that they would crush an ounce, but it is
doubtful if the ore will yield a third of it.
* * » *
Pilbarra Copper Fields (W.A.) announce
that Copper Separation, Ltd., Perth, has
agreed to instal a treatment plant on the
Whim Well mines and divide the proceeds.
Copper Separation adheres to its original
estimated profit of £BOO,OOO based on “reason-
ably probable ore reserves, and subject to
changes in the price of copper.” So far a
lot of money has been put into, and a lot of
copper taken out of, the ground without
shareholders in the original or subsequent
cos. getting any return. If Copper Separa-
tion, Ltd., succeeds in making the profit it
anticipates, the age of mining miracles will
not be past.
* * * *
Ivalgoorlie-Boulder miners have rejected
the Chamber of Mines offer of an all-round
shift increase of Bd. for surface and Is.
for underground hands. They are holding
out for the return of the Is. 6d. which was
cut off by the State Arbitration Court re-
cently, and say they will take nothing less.
At least two London directors who recently
visited the mines and studied working condi-
tions have said that they are not averse to
the rates asked for being paid; but a few
diehards at the Chamber of Mines, who seem
more concerned about low wages than cheap-
ening production in other ways, are against
giving more than they can help.
Dr. Clapp left Westralia after inspecting
some areas in the Nor’-West, but he did not
set foot on either the Freney or Okes-Durack
concession. 11 is report on the possibility or
finding payable oil in the regions visited
will be handed to A. E. Broue in Sydney.
His remarks before leaving were not en-
couraging.
* * * *
Daisy Queen (W.A.) has had another
reverse. Just as it was becoming hopeful a
former manager upset its financial arrange-
ments by lodging a winding-up petition
which, although subsequently withdrawn, put
a damper on call-paying. As a result the
co. is again short of funds, and has been
obliged to abandon its option on the Vivien
Gem, which a recent circular described as
good.
* * * *
To date Ives Reward (W.A.) has received
£22,937 in calls and expended over £45,000.
Now it owes £3OOO to directors and over
£2OOO apiece to the bank and the Govern-
ment. The Board claims that there is suffi-
cient ore in sight to keep 10-liead busy for
three years, but a Bulletin man who knows
the mine doubts it.
* * * #
Rare metal mining in Queensland has been
out of fashion since war prices dropped. A
little is being done now at Wolfram (N.Q.)
in the Avoca and Victory mines, but there
is not much in it at present prices. The
Victory is carrying a lot. of wolfram, but
this has to be left on the dump while it only
brings 10s. 6d. per unit. The low price of
molybdenite is the only bar to Queensland
becoming again one of the world’s leading
producers, for the ore is there.
* * * *
Fluorspar mining is active round Chilla-
goe (N.Q.) ; the product is going to B. H.
Prop, at Newcastle. The Almaden mine is
operating on a lode of pure ’spar 4ft. wide
assaying 95 p.c. calcium fluoride. The
mineral is also being worked at Mungana
and Dargalong.
* * * *
The cobalt show near Mungana (N.Q.) has
been dropped. It was discovered shortly after
the Mt. Cobalt lode and, like it, is in diorite.
But there the resemblance ends. The Mun-
gana was prospected to a depth of 70ft., and
the vein of cobalt petered out to a knife-
edge. Anyway, the demand for cobalt at
present is not too keen, high-grade concen-
trates excepted.
* * # *
The Black Rock lode, which has so far
proved the highest values on the Isa Mines
leases, was located in the Isa Prop.’s Out-on-
Iler-Own lease in the No. 2 shaft, and this
has now been pushed down to 110 ft. Assay
values to that depth went as high as 60 p.c.
lead and a high return for silver, and G. J.
Rodda considers it the most promising de-
velopment thus far on the Prop.’s leases.
* * * *
The Marvel tin-mine at Emuford (N.Q.)
is Fred Reid’s latest float, and £lO shares
were taken up like hot cakes. It is capitalised
at £6OOO, and although the shaft is down only
25ft. ore in sight is considered to be worth
£3OOO to £4OOO. The lode is Bft. wide and is
bulking 10 p.c. tin. and if it lasts any dis-
tance profits should soon pass back the cash
invested. The 70 tons already out of the
shaft, bulking 10 p.c., is worth about £l2OO.
The lode has been traced for over a mile, and
although scratched before has never yielded
anything like the present prospects. Evi-
dently the present body is a lens, but it will
take only a couple like this to make a mine of
it. For its bulk it is one of the richest
shoots found in N.Q. to date.
* * * *
The coal struck at 500 ft. at the State-
owned Hartley mine, Styx River (Q.), was
not good enough, but samples taken recently
at 700 ft. stand the test.
* * * *
North Queensland tinfields, with 70 p.c.
concentrates touching £155, are more than
holding their own. Herberton leads, but its
figures include 'Stannary Hills, where the
Arbouin is the standby. For September a
fine crushing from the Wild Irishman yielded
17 tons of concentrates from 135 tons, value
£2S9O. After the Arbouin. Vulcan tri-
butors are turning out most tin. Great
Northern crushings are not yet up to expec-
tations. Something better than 31 p.c.
metallic values are looked for from it,
although on the present market it is paying
comfortably. Dereks, Ltd., is in the melting-
pot. Reconstruction is in the air, and pro-
bably another mine will be given a trial.
St. Smith, lately with Mt. Isa, has been
advising on the group. The general idea is
that there are no fireworks in the bunch, but
that the Lass o’ Gowrie has a good chance
at present prices.
* * * *
The anxiety on Mount Isa (Q.) due to the
shortage of water has disappeared. In a
Government well near the Leichhardt River
water was struck at 80ft.; and two soaks
in the river are holding out very well.
* * * *
The Nightflower, Chillagoe field, after
bursting into bloom, faded away for some
time. But developments during the last two
months have been good. The deepest shaft
is down 70ft., and is in Bft. of ore, and in
two other shafts the stone is averaging 4ft.
thick. As the shafts are well spaced the
mine looks to have a considerable ore body.
As to values the average of 850 tons mined
was 290 z. silver, 24 p.c. lead and ldwt. gold,
a gross value of about £ll ss. per ton. The
values are, however, not as good as they look,
for, much of the ore is zincy. and the spelter
is not likely to be saved unless it increases
considerably. The Queensland Government
holds a section of the lode, but has done
little with it.
Twenty-four feet of good crushing ore is
reported in the bottom level of Barclay’s
mine ht Mt. Coolon (Q.). At the Coolon
mine, at 130ft., the lode is lift, wide, and
samples of the sands from the milling of
ore from the bottom workings are worth £7
a ton. The lode in the Sydney claim is said
to be big and rich. These are the three
shows over which Bill Clark has taken an
amalgamated option with a view to a float
in Sydney.
* * * *
In 1S96 the N.S.W. Mines Dept, offered a
reward of £500 to the prospector of a new
metalliferous field, and the amount, though
since raised to £1000, remains among the
unclaimed prizes. Conditions attached include
the proviso that the new field must be more
than 10 miles from any existing mining-camp,
and that within two years from the date of
discovery not less than 250 men are employed
on the line of lode. As a matter of grace
£200 was voted to Keogh, the discoverer of
Ardlethan ; but he failed to substantiate his
claim to the reward, owing to insufficient
development during the first two years and
other informalities. Just now no claimant
with a chance catches the eye.
* * * *
The Commonwealth Analyst has examined
“a sample of oil said to have been obtained
from Wakip River, Mandated Territory, New
Guinea,” and states that the crude oil
“closely resembles in properties certain types
of Borneo petroleum, arid, without treatment
of any kind is suitable for use as a liquid
fuel oil.” Which is taken as something to
go on with by the Mandated Development Co.,
Ltd., from whose prospecting bore it came.
* * * *
“Gouger” sighs for olden, golden days:—
The first four and a half years on the Palmer
(Q.) yielded 53 tons of gold valued at £5,088,000,
and that included little of the metal recovered by
the Chinese, whose numbers, according to one
authority, reached 20,000. Numerous pockets on
the river bars gave as much as lOoz. to the dish.
It required an ounce a day to pay, as prices of
provisions were sky-high, flour touching £20 a bag.
A Maytown crushing which would make the mouths
of present-day reef men water was 12,000 tons for
36,000oz., worth £4 per oz.
* * * if *
Sulphide Corporation expects to start
cement production at the beginning of next
year, by which time £200.000 will have been
spent on construction. The plant, which is
alongside the old smelting works at Cockle
Creek (N.S.W.). will have a capacity of
30,000 tons p.a., but at comparatively little
cost may be enlarged to double or treble
tbat figure.
* * * *
“Talpa”: With regard to “Oil Zany’s”
suggestion of foul play as the cause of the
block in Orallo bore, in the course of 20
years’ experience I have known of only one
authentic instance of material being malici-
ously dropped in a well by an outsider. But
I know of several where suspicion pointed to
the principals themselves. Difficulties were
encountered which they could not surmount,
and, to save their reputations, they “fixed”
the wells, attributing the damage to rivals or
outsiders. Explosives were used to render the
Roumanian wells useless during the war, but
Fritz got quite a number producing again.
The recovery of a piece of material dropped
down casually should not present many diffi-
culties to a man who knows the game and has
the equipment. Nobody appears to know
what has happened at Orallo. but local
opinion is that the drill-stem is “sanded up.
which is probably correct, and the only
method of tackling it would be by a “wash-
over” job, necessitating an extra string of
pipe. Electrical fishing tools are of no ser-
vice where a heavy pull is required.
* * * *
“Radio” : Mine-managers of certain copper,
lead, tin and even iron pyrite shows may
have to take precautions on similar lines to
those adopted at “specimen” gold-mines of
the old days. Crystal wireless sets arfc in
such demand at present that likely-looking
ores can be sold at from 15s. to 40s. per
pound. The “billy” of every man employed in
a mine will hold from 21b. to 51b. of “crystal
ore, for which there is a ready sale. The
prices paid by the public for a “crystal”
appear ridiculous, no doubt, but a conscien-
tious dealer will only sell tested material,
and it has been proved that in some cases
less than 101b. weight of such may be con-
tained in one ton of ore. Present wholesale
prices for “crystal” material range from £2
per lb. for bornite (sulphide of copper and
iron), £1 per pound for galena, 15s. for
pyrite and £1 for cassiterite, but the last
is scarce. Molybdenite is also a winner, but
hard to procure. Sellers had better get busy,
however, for not only will the market soon
be punctured, but mine shareholders will
want to know why this source of revenue
does not figure in the balance-sheet.
* * * *
Statistics of the last three years’ oil-well
drilling in the U.S.A. point a lesson for Aus-
tralia. Less than 1 per cent, of the wells
drilled started at 2000 barrels daily or more.
Of SO.OOO wells completed, 25 per cent,
were dry holes, S per cent, were of un-
certain value, and 35 per cent, were gas-
wells or wells of less than 25 barrels per
day. This was in a time when some of the
country’s biggest fields and pools were de-
veloped, and when geology had made pros-
pecting something more than a gamble. A
few failures should, therefore, not discourage
the huiliers in Australia. At the same time
it ought to be realised that our lack of suc-
cess has been mainly due to boring without
proper geological advice.

“FaiTeigh”: George Pearce is the only
survivor in the States House —or what was
designed therefor —of W.A.’s first Senate
team. But all the other five are alive, and
four are pretty comfortably fixed in other
spheres of utility. Stanifortli Smith is Com-
J. H. BUTTERS, general manager and chief
engineer of the Speck’s hydro-electric
department, who has been appointed
chairman of the Canberra Commission
at £3000 p.a.
missioner for Lands in Papua. Alex.
Matheson succeeded his brother in a Scottish
baronetcy four years ago. Norman Ewing
is a Tasmanian Judge. Ned Harney is an
English K.C. and M.P., who has doubtless
been employing his gift of florid eloquence
this last week or two to retain the second
distinction. Only Hugh de Largie, who
held liis Senate seat up to last election, has
disappeared from public view.
As S.A. will celebrate its centenary in
12 years, it is surprising that any of the
original passengers on the Buffalo, which
brought Governor Hindmarsh from England
to start the infant colony, should survive;
yet Miss . Fisher still lives, and the last male
pioneer, 11. W. Breaker, lias just died at 93.
He was old enough to remember the voyage,
the call at Port Lincoln (whose harbor so
attracted Hindmarsh that he wanted it for
the capital) and (the landing at Glenelg.
As a young man he went fossicking at Bal-
larat, Spring .(’reek and other diggings in
Vic. and Gympic (Q.)., The last half-cen-
tury he spent' among the Methodists of
Moonta.
The chairmanship of the Canberra Com-
mission lias gone to John Henry Butters,
manager and engineer of the Speck's Hydro-
Electric Department. A native of Alvcr-
stoke (Eng.), Butters graduated in engineer-
ing at the University College, Southampton,
and served his apprenticeship with Thorn y-
crofts. Siemens Bros, took him from the
warship-builders and made him their design-
ing engineer, and after some years sent him
to their Australasian branch. In 1909 he
joined the co. that was formed to liarness-up
Tasmania’s water-power, and when the Gov-
ernment took over the work in October, 1914,
he went on the State’s pay roll. He will
be 43 next birthday and his screw is £3OOO
a year.
T. J. LEY, N.S.W.

Col. George Somerville, Commandant of
the 3rd Military District (Vic.) and a
Brisbane Grammar old boy, gets the late
Monty Somer’s job as secretary of the R.A.S.,
Sydney. A son of J. B. Somerville, one-time
manager of the Royal Bank at Brisbane, he
was born at Gouiburn, and was with the
Bank of N. S. Wales for a while. He left for
the other side!as Adjutant of the 6th Light
Horse, later quarter-mastered the Ist and
2nd Divvies in turn, and was A.Q.M.G. to
the. Australian Corps , under Birdwood and
Monasli. On returning home he occupied a
number of big staff jobs in Vic. Six years
on the land in the Hunter River District,
plus his bank! and army experience, should
help him to handle Sydney’s big Easter
Show. He is only 45.
Sir Percy Scott has gone to join the de-
parted souls who in the guise of seagulls are
supposed to haunt the sterns of British men-
of-war. Tale upon tale could be told of the
departed Admiral, but none of them suggest
any great degree of personal popularity. The
six-inch guns fit Ladysmith first brought him
to the fore and led also to the writing—Sir
Alan Everett, lately First Naval Member in
Australia, has been accused of the authorship
—of the famous “Percy Scott Creed,” which
started: “I believe in one Percy Scott, Cap-
tain übiquitous, maker of gun carriages and
of all things useful and marvellous.” Never-
theless, his name will always be associated
with progress in naval gunnery; he was the
inventor of the “director” which enabled all
guns to be laid, trained and fired from one
central position, and that the best one for
purposes of observation.
R. IT. Cambage retires from the position
of N.S.W. ■ Under-Sec. for Mines on Nov. 7,
after nine years’ pseful service. Born at
Milton (N.S.W.) in 1559, he was articled
to a surveyor ; practically the first job at
which he assisted was the survey of the
National Park (1879-80). In 1882 he
entered the Government service as a draughts-
man in the Lands Department, and went on
to the Mines in 1885. He has carried out
surveys on practically all the fields of the
State; over two years were spent in under-
ground surveys in the Newcastle coal-mines,
and the valuable experience gained there
enabled him to give most important evidence
in regard to the Mount Kembla colliery
disaster in 1902. His hobby is botany: lie is
a high authority off the influence of geologi-
cal formations on flora. He is at present
president of >the N. S. AVales Linnsean
Society, and is a Fellow of the Linnsean
Society of London.
William Thorley Loton, who died in Perth
the other day at the ripe age of 85, was best
known to the present generation as a solidly
successful business man. His political acti-
vities were left behind with last century,
when he had a seat in the old Legislative
Council before responsible government
arrived in ’9l; and he put in terms in
both Houses in the ensuing decade, when
Bigjolin Forrest was supreme in W.A. poli-
tics. Also he was a member of the Federa-
tion Conventions of ’Ol and ’97-98; his death
must leave Sydney’s William McMillan about
the only survivor of the former gathering.
Loton was a native of Staffordshire, and
arrived in Australia in ’63.
“Macquarie Street” on a flight of stars :
For the first time in history Australian medical
practitioners have had front seats in a surgical con-
gress in America; and great interest was taken in
the motion pictures exhibited by Dr. Royle and Pro-
fessor Hunter, showing the improvement in locomo-
tion of cases of spastic paralysis after section of the
abdominal sympathetic nerves. It is gratifying that
these two young wonders should have had a chance
of demonstrating their epoch-making discoveries be-
fore such an audience. Mr. H. B. Devine, a Melbourne
surgeon, showed his methods of operating upon the
stomach, having the use .of the famous Maj r o clinic
at Rochester for the purpose. Amongst the Maori -
landers at. the Congress was the distinguished ophthal-
mic surgeon Lindo Ferguson, of Dunedin, who will
be the President of the Medical Congress to be held
in M.L. in 1926. The doyen of the Australasian
contingent is Dr. Ralph Worrall (Sydney), who began
his gynaecological work in the early ’eighties, at the
Sydney Hospital, as assistant to Dr. Thomas Cham-
bers. I know something of the extent and range of
the latter’s practice, for I had to keep his “admis-
sions” book; patients came.to him from all over the
continent. Dr. Worrall made full use of his oppor-
tunities as assistant to such a distinguished chief,
and after the latter's death became senior gynaeco-
logical surgeon, and held the position until he
reached the retiring age of 60. Together with two
other visiting surgeons, Mr. Devine and Mr. Hamil-
ton Russell, he was the recipient of the greatest

The Barossa seat in the S.A. Assembly,
rendered vacant by the death of ex-Minister
William Hague, is generally safe for a
Liberal. Therefore it has attracted old
Richard Butler, lately Speaker, and a fre-
quent member of Cabinet before that; also
Homburg, who was once Attorney-General.
But the Liberal Union has passed them both
over for H. B. Crosby, now of various motor
firms in the city, but . originally of Gawler.
He was junior for Barossa from 1917 till
last April.
Though many of those who cut up Jimmy
Tyson’s £1,280,000 had a brief and merry
time, physically and financially, his nephew,
Albert Prince Edward Tyson, was a careful
man in both senses, lived out his allotted
span and left a tidy £304,809. His family
gets what is not taken by the capital levies
made by Commonwealth and States.
There may not be much honor among
thieves, but there is a very rigid discipline.
The criminal who turns informer —no matter
how heinous the crime he helps the police
to sheet home —is a marked man, and knows
it. According to evidence given in the Mel-
bourne Practice Court last week, Sydney
Harding, the gaolbird who evidence
against Colin Ross and earned £250 reward
and his liberty thereby, found it necessary
to get out of the Commonwealth in a hurry.
As he has never been heard of from that
day to this, it is by no means certain that
he evaded the vengeance of the underworld
from which he fled; if he is alive he has
covered his tracks well. His wife, seeking
a divorce, had no trouble in convincing the
Judge that she had no clue to the where-
abouts of her missing spouse. Hence, ser-
vice of the usual papers was dispensed with
absolutely—an unusual and sweeping dispen-
sation for the Court to make.
Passed out at Ballina, Northern Rivers
district (N.S.W.), Charles Moss, who
crowded some queerly diversified architec-
tural jobs into his 94 years. He designed
the hands of the clock for St. Paul’s, Lon-
don; the pulpit and reading-desk of St.
Andrew’s, Sydney, and the King’s palace in
Fiji.
Archie McLean, one of the pioneer selec-
tors of the Gulf and Central Q. Districts,
passed out recently in Cloncurry Hospital.
He joined with his parents in one of the gold
rushes, and went across to the Diamentina
with his wife to take up country, but drought
sent him back again. In ’S4 he went to
Cloncurry, and was the first to carry copper
ore to Normanton for Ernest Henry. He
selected subsequently on the Williams River.
Laboring to put out a bush fire a few years
ago he got a stroke from which he never
completely recovered.
The set-back he got over his badly-sub-
mitted proposal to keep war heroes out of
school books, plus an attack of ’flu, seems to
have effaced Lemon, Vic.’s Minister for Edu-
cation. He administers his department
with such diligence and modesty that he and
his background are scarcely distinguishable.
Lionel George Macarthur has been killed
in a motor accident on Maxwellton, a run
which he was managing for the Australian
and N.Z. Land Co. His was the oldest
pioneering family in Australia, and his son,
aged 13, is now the last of the line. Lionel
George was the son of Capt. George Hanni-
bal Macarthur, R.N. He was born at
King’s School, Parramatta, where his grand-
father, the Rev. George Fairfowl Macarthur,
was headmaster. His great-grandfather was
Governor Philip King; and his great-grand-
uncle Macarthur was the first to introduce
the merino into Australia.
The ’plane is becoming a familiar sight of
the Western Queensland country. The other
day W. Coode, a Longreach sheep-buyer,
flew from Longreach to Terreck station, on
the other side of
the Barcoo. in-
spected and bought
some thousands of
sheep, and re-
turned to Long-
reacli the same
afternoon, doing
the 260 miles !n
two hours and a
half. A few years
ago it took three
days, with good
horses and fine
weather, to do the
journey. If it was
wet, and the Doug-
las Ponds on the
Barcaldine - road
were running a
banker, the trip
might take three
weeks —or three
months.
T. B. MOLOMBY.
Victoria’s newest
Commissioner of
Railways.
J. P. .Tones, Vic. Labor Minister for
Works, who leads the Upper Chamber, is
persona grata with members, and they would
have had more reluctance in throwing out
the Wheat Pool Bill had he been in charge
of it. He has a persuasive style and a way
of playing on weaknesses that some of the
old boys find hard to resist. As a successful
business man, he was probably not sorry
that he was not identified personally with
the wild-cat bill.
Laborite McAdam has been confirmed in
his membership for Ballarat East. Bob
McGregor, who held the Assembly seat for
80 years, applied for a recount three months
ago, which after many sittings of the com-
mittee disclosed that McAdam was a winner
by four votes, and not by eight votes, as the
returning-officer had declared. The nice
point whether McAdam’s mother, since dead,
had a right to vote, was even raised. The
proceedings must have cost McGregor apd
his friends twice as much as an ordinary
election. ; ‘
Died at 80, Margaret Mcßrydo, a sister ,of
Donald Gordon, who sold his 640-acre home-
stead block to the. Morgans, who found the
Mt. Morgan mine on the site. Margaret
Mcßryde landed in Brisbane during the
Crimean War, went to Rockhampton in ’6l
and had lived there ever since.
Gone aloft, Cap’n William McDowell, another
of Sydney’s League of Ancient Mariners and
one of its founders. A Scot out of Glasgow,
he came this way as a youngster before the
mast on an immigrant windjammer, and
never after left the Australian coast. Work-
ing up to a master’s ticket, lie took over the
collier Duckenfield for J. and A. Brown, but
after that packet went to Davy Jones’s on
Long Reef he linked up with Howard Smith,
finally quitting blue water for a shore job.
He was 66 when the flags were half-masted.
“Hamer” : Just dead Allan McDougall made
the Sydney Eight Hours Art Union the big
affair it is to-day: it had formerly had a
mere city scope. It at last grew so big
that the old “bob” tickets had to be re-
modelled in order to keep the revenue inside
the bounds allowed by law: only 3d. of eac.i
ticket was ostensibly for the Art Union, the
other Od. being for admission to the sports.
McDougall also helped to bring the N.S.W.
Rugby League into existence, and his son
Charlie was the manager of the team which
went to Brisbane last season.
E. J. H. Knapp, of Beecroft (Sydney),
had the joy of reading his own obituary
notice the other day. An “In Memoriam’
of his father, who died at Braidwood in 1875,
and who had the same initials as the son,
was sent to a Sydney newspaper office, and
somehow got among the death notices. That
started the trouble: the next thing was the
production of a long obituary article (of the
son) for the same issue. The: really-dead
E.J.H. arrived in Sydney in 1825 in the
Sesostris. It was his son, the still-living
E.J.H., who wrote out, at Wentworth’s re-
quest, the petition to Queen Victoria to
grant a Constitution for the colony. Fol-
lowing in his father’s footsteps, Edward was
the first licensed surveyor under the N.S.M.
Real Property Act. Ivnapp, jun., is 90, and
enjoys good health.
THE LAMENT OF THE CITY FATHER.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
“By a small majority the suggestion that train
and tram passes should be issued to Municipal Coun-
cillors was rejected. ‘The whole of the State and
Federal Legislatures have this right,’ said Cr.
Hayes. ‘Why shouldn’t we ? They get a salary;
we get nothing but glory.’ ” — Age.
When the new drain is safely laid,
The water-channel firmly set,
What does the Council, stern and staid,
For all its heavy labors get?
Just glory! The impulsive cheer
A passing dustman idly gives;
The hiccup of a man in beer
Who on a Council pension lives!
No sculptor cuts, with zest superb,
Its members’ names upon the kerb.
What is such glory, after all—
This pomp of supervising drains,
Or saying how the rates shall fall,
Of fixing roads and laying mains?
A barren thing! An empty fame,
Passing when next election comes.
Though dingy street may bear the name
Of him who for such honor “hums,”
What shall it profit when it’s got—
A tramfare quite outweighs the lot!
VICTORIA.

“The Overlander”: In S.-W. Queensland
recently three horsemen were riding abreast, about
20 yards separating them, when a blinding flash of
lightning claimed the centre horse and man as its
victims, knocking the other two horses down, and
hurling one of the riders 10 yards—he was para-
lysed for two hours, but recovered. The uninjured
man was the father of the lad of 16 who was killed:
the lad was pinned underneath his horse; both were
killed instantaneously. The poor dad endeavored
frantically to free his son from beneath his dead
burden, and had all but one leg clear when assist-
ance arrived. Some people will tell you that light-
ning will strike the highest objects; yet there were
trees all round where this happened. Years ago, on
Isis Downs, Upper Barcoo, Bill Smith one evening
was trudging home with a chain flung across his
shoulder, one end trailing on the ground, when a
flash of lightning hit the chain and stripped Bill
of all his clothing, yet left him uninjured. He was
“Lightning Smith” after that; perhaps you knew
him as a champion axeman. By the way, is there
any foundation to the theory that motor-cars are the
safest refuge in a lightning storm?

“Cartot” : The Marshall Islanders’* custom
of making string charts, which were oriented by
turning one side to the east (B. 2/10/’24), is one of
many circumstances which suggest a connection
between the peoples of the Pacific and those of the
ancient civilisations of the Mediterranean. The
Phoenicians had charts which were drawn on a kind
of parchment made from the skins of animals; they
were stretched upon wooden frames and oriented by
placing them so that one side was parallel with the
eastern horizon. And before these parchment charts
came into use there were others which, from refer-
ences in the writings of early Greek authors, were
probably similar to those described by “Bouragi.”
There are many resemblances of this sort, and it
seems plain that either the islands of the Pacific,
especially in the north-west portion, were peopled by
migrations from the west, or else the races of the
Mediterranean and those of the Pacific had a com-
mon origin.
* * * •
“Loco”: As to magpies building low down
(B. 2/10/’24), a mate working on a branch line in
our Western Vic. district has a lot of young maggies
coming on. They are in a tussock of grass on the
ground alongside his pair of rails, and are doing
quite; well, thank you. The country is not treeless,
so Mrs. Magpie’s excuse for her conduct is not known.
Perhaps it is that among the mags, a really smart
young matron has got to do something to attract
attention, just as she has to among the humans.
* * * *
“Wiremu”: “Te Pana” (B. 21/8/’24)
writes about the old Maori belief in incantations to
procure successful voyages. My aged friend Haimona
told me that an old-time tohunga of any standing
could invoke fair wind and weather at will. Many
years ago he, with a canoe load of his brown brethren,
had occasion to cross the turbulent water of Cook
Strait from Queen Charlotte Sound (South Island ).
The local tohunga, being
ordered to provide a fair day
for the voyage, produced the
goods, and all went merrily
until they neared Terawhiti,
at the southern end of the
North Island, 17 miles from
their port of embarkation.
Then they came up against it;
the wind changed and the
waters boiled and seethed
against them, and they had
perforce to turn tail and run
home again. The cause of
the trouble turned out to be
a tohunga of a North Island
tribe, who had been commanded
to provide a fair wind and
tide to enable some of his
crowd to make a trip to the
South Island. Haimona, who
was a tohunga of sorts him-
self, was a firm believer in the
saving powers of an invoca-
tion in times of peril. When
quite a young man he was one
of a party fishing for hapuku
some miles off shore. Owing
to the party failing to propi-
tiate old Tangaroa (the Maori
Neptune), he spitefully sent
three heavy- waves, which cap-
sized the canoe. Haimona
was the only one to reach
the shore. When he was
about all in, he remembei’ed
a never-failing invocation to
old Tangaroa himself. On re-
citing this, he found himself
taken up by a shoal of herrings and rushed ashore. I
suggested that the three heavy waves were caused by
an earthquake. Haimona replied; “No, it was Tan-
garoa who was offended, and he didn’t deal in earth-
quakes.” The waves were caused by one of his
henchmen, a marine monster, who lived at the
bottom of the sea, inhaling and exhaling the water
at the command of his boss.
* * * *
“Cwrw Bach”: “Leo Lear” (B. 2/10/’24)
must be careful not to confuse the 28-spotted leaf-
eating ladvbird with the 18-spotted aphis—or scale-
devourer. They are unfortunately very much alike.
The best way to distinguish friend from foe is to
remember that the latter has all her spots entire;
on the friend the central black spots are divided one
half being on each wing-cover.
* * * *
“Pfella”: At Black Range (W.A.) the
abo.’s maternity hospital is his camp, with a Dig
fire and a heap of black ashes as accessories. The
father is midwife and doctor together, and the young
black is ushered into the light of Australia -to the
accompaniment of subdued chanting from the throats
of invited niggers, who sit ringed around the fire
to keep the devils off. The moment little Binghi is
born he is rolled in the black ashes and left to
dry, while firesticks are waved above the mother to
warm her. Half an hour later she is expected lo
get on her feet. As soon as she stands up her man
places the new black atom of humanity on her
back, and the ceremony is over.
“Akram”: Has any Abo. ever been chased
by a snake? I have, and was nearly captured, too.
I had been trying to settle that idiotic statement
made by someone that circling a rope round the
reptile will prevent his escape while the would-be-
executioner is hunting up a weapon. I came across
one of the black variety', about sft. of him, on a bush
track near Ballina (N.S.W.). He appeared to be
asleep. I was fishing at the time, and was carrying
about 30 yards of half-inch hauling rope. No sticks
being handy, I unrolled the rope, and had almost
got him in a circle, when he suddenly woke up and
made a bee-line for my leg. I made a bee-line for
a weapon. He was intent on having a lap at me, and
the rope didn't, stop him. He cleared it in a

second. Instead of making for the undergrowth, he
kept at me. He must have come 50yds. and was
gaining when I picked up a tea-tree pole and went
back to meet him. He was just congratulating
himself on his catch when his back struck something
a bit hard.
* # * *
“Adamascus”: In a deep lagoon outside
Ayr (N.Q.) there were recently found a pair of
bullocks in good condition with their horns inter-
locked, and the forelegs of each resting on rhe
shoulders of the other. They had evidently been
fighting on the bank of the lagoon when their
horns locked, and in struggling to free themselves
they had fallen into the water. Here, unable to
rise, they drowned. In death the horns were not
freed, the bullocks being disposed of as they were
found.
* * * *
“Wanimo”: Even rarer than the blue
bird-of-paradise is the Psiridochora alberti, of which
there is a good specimen in the Brisbane Museum.
This seems to be a kind of missing link, or argu-
ment in favor of the reptilian origin of birds. It
has two long “wires” curving down over its back,
and on them are what look like scales. Microscopical
examination shows that these are really of the same
composition as feathers, but to the eye they are
scales, and nothing else.
* * * *
“Fana”: Tell “C.M.” that the collie is
foully slandered by those who say it is treacherous
(B. 9/10/’24). After an acquaintance with the breed
extending over years, 1 can say that I have never
encountered nor heard of a single incident that would
lend support to the charge. It is doubtful indeed, if
any kind of dog—with the possible exception of the
Pomeranian —is unfaithful or treacherous, because
of a streak of that kind in its nature. The Pom.
is frequently inclined to be spiteful, usually because
of bad temper, due to lack of proper exercise and
feeding.
“Two Seas”: Re “C.M.’s” inquiry, “Are collie dogs
treacherous?” (B. 9/10/’24). I have on two or
three occasions found them held by their legs in
dingo traps, and when trying to release them I have
been bitten severely for my: pains. One slut I had
owned and worked for years had to be laid out with
a waddy before she could be released. I dunr.o
whether it should be called treachery or just plain
idiocy. The gentle Strawberry invariably attacks
the good Samaritan who hauls her out of a bog ; so
perhaps it is idiocy.
“Chloe”: In Fremantle (W.A.) about 1904, Dr.
Lotz, a well-known medico, was playing with his
comrade and pet, a splendid-looking Scotch collie.
Suddenly, and with no provocation, the dog sprang
at the doctor, biting off his ear, and badly tearing
the face. While I was on the goldfields an fid
Scotch shepherd was brought in to the Southern
Cross hospital to be treated for a lacerated wound in
the arm and another in the thigh. Again a collie
pet seemed to have gone suddenly mad and cruelly
attacked his best friend. The old fellow died from
the combined effect of blood poison and shock. A
reason *nr the savage freaks of the collie in Aus-
tralia may be that, being a cold-climate dog, the
conditions of life in semi-tropic areas unsettles his
digestion and his mind; for ordinarily he is very
affectionate, and has the manners of the days of
chivalry.
“Mephisto”: Insectivorous plants (E.
25/9/’24) generally grow in poor, swampy soil, which
is usually deficient in nitrates and other available
nitrogen compounds. So they depend for their
nitrogen on captured insects. “Borom” is incorrect
in saying that the flower does the eating, for in
all such plants capture and digestion are done by
means of modified leaves. The chief insectivorous
plants are the butterwort (Pinguicula), sundew
{Drosera rotundifolia) , bladderwort ( Utricularia .),
Venus flytrap ( Dioncea muscipula ) and the pitcher
plants ( Nepenthes and Sorracenia). In the butterwort
the insects are caught by a sticky secretion and
washed by the rain to the edge of the leaf, which
cutis over, exudes digestive ferments, absorbs the
products and unrolls again. In
the sundew, common in Queens-
land, the insects are caught cn
leaf tentacles, which bend over
and pour a digestive fluid on to
them, rendering soluble albuminous
and proteid substances- —the same
process as in animal digestion.
The tentacles may be stimulated
to movement by continued contact
with any solid substance, but no
digestive fluid is secreted unless a
suitable organic substance is placed
on the leaf. The bladderwort is
a submerged water plant with
bladders containing valves which
open inwards only. These serve as
traps for water-mites, etc. The
Venus flytrap is a native of Caro-
lina. The leaves are two-lobed,
and the midrib acts as a hinge,
so that when an insect alights .he
lobes snap together and capture it.
Digestion occurs as in the sundew
In the pitcher plants the whole
or part of the leaf is developed
as a pitcher containing water and
pepsin, so that insects falling in
are first drowned and then digested.
The lids are often brightly colored
to help in attracting insects. Most
insectivorous plants have enough
chlorophyl to enable them to make
all the organic food they need,
and can grow quite well without
a supply of insects. However,
when fed with insects, raw meat or boiled egg,
they become stronger, flower more freely and produce
stronger and more numerous seeds.
* * * *
“Caesar”: The red deer is becoming a pest
in Queensland as well as in Maoriland (B. 2/10/’24).
Years ago the Bananaland Government and J. H.
McConnell each imported five, which were liberated
on the reserve at Gregor’s Creek (S.Q.). The progeny
now number some hundreds. They are very thick
along the Brisbane Valley, and have been seen as
far north as Mackay.
“Regnis”: “Smilax” and “Jimmy Pos-
sum” have discoursed on the virtues of Flindersia
oxleyana, and “Jimmy P.” states that a big milling
firm has turned the timber down on several occasions,
the excuse being that it was too oily. Having as
a sawyer cut Flindersia in several districts, let me
tell James that the oiliness is no drawback, but that
every Flindersia which has passed middle age becomes
brittle, the defect starting at the heart and extending
towards the sap as the tree ages. I have cut logs
which turned out 70 per cent, waste, the bulk of
the timber falling to pieces as it went over the
running-out bench. In ’B5 I sold to a wheelwright

a stick he picked from a stack and which he
declared was the best he had seen. The stick was
to be used for a bullock-waggon pole, and when
fitted it looked a beauty, having a beautiful and
perfectly straight grain. Seemingly, it was fit for
any strain. Yet the first gully saw it snap, and
this with no load on the waggon.

“Wandi”: A shrewd old pioneer of the
Richmond (N.SAV.) was Daddy Fawcett. He was
squatter, M.P., chemist, doctor and general adviser..
On one occasion, while he stopped at Dean’s Hotel,
in Lismore, there was a rumpus over a pair of ear-
drops that had disappeared from Mrs. Dean’s bed-
room.. Suspicion pointed to one of the servants.
Then Daddy took a hand. He asked Mrs. Dean if
there were any large green tree-toads about the
place. “Yes,” she told him. “One is often about
m.v washstand.” “Well,” said Daddy, “vou catch
that toad, and you’ll have the thief.” A hunt at .
once commenced for tree-toads, which have a habit 1
of swallowing bright objects, and eventually the bed-
room visitor was caught, and the ornaments were
recovered from his interior.

“Two Seas”: That yarn of “HerodotV’
vB. 9/10/ 24) re the youth who, “hearing a sß°ht
rustling behind a log, fired a bullet at the spoV’
reminds me of a kangaroo-shooter who had accident-
ally shot himself, and was crawling to his camp , n
the Gwydir, being murdered by a similar blind /shot
How many have lost their lives through the. idiot
with a gun who fired at “something behind a hush”
that he couldn't see? Such “sportsmen” shqrjld be
given six months’ hard and debarred from, holding
a gun license. °
SIGNS OF SPRING.
“A bathing-costume, please—for walkinlg in”
Wewak”: I doubt whether Rfobin, Hootd
and the other great archers of mediaeval EnglarM
would have made much of the bows a'nd arrows useld
on the mainland of New Guinea a> JO ut Aitape arid
Madang. The bowstring is not a string, but a
flat strip of cane or bamboo, h» if an j nc h or g 0
in width. Then the arrows are not notched; you
simply press the end up agaiir.st the “string” and
keep on pressing till you are ready to let go.
The arrows are mot feathered ; they have a head of
hardwood 18 inches leng fitted into a reed two
oi' three feet longi The bows are from five to six
feet long, and as far as I have noticed there is no
regular custom of unstringing them when they are
not in use. Yet an expert can make some wonderful
shooting with them, and even an amateur can soon
learn to make a fair showing.
“Vanikoro”; Parallels have been drawn
between certain aspects of Polynesian life and the
customs of the ancient Greeks. But has anyone
pointed , out the remarkable resemblance between
the lava-lava of the Polynesians and the “scalloped”
loincloth worn by the Minoans of Crete, whose
empire, based on sea power and the control of the
AN OPTIMIST.
c. 'eastern Mediterranean, went down about 1400 b.c.,
S probably as a result of the assaults of the Greeks
1 coming in from the north? Judging by the
» fragments of their art that have come down to us,
the Minoan men usually wore nothing but this loin-
-cloth and a bracelet or two. The costume of the
£ ’classical Greeks was quite different; they wore
Ji either a great deal more clothes, or, when they
were exercising or hard at work, even less. When
i Cnossos fell and their power was broken, the Cretans
) swarmed down on Egypt. Perhaps some of them
j got into the Red Sea and kept moving eastward.
“Ancient Tramp”: I don’t agree with
‘ “Fana” (B. 9/10/’24) that two miles an hour, with a
1 few minutes’ rest each hour, is the best gait for
:a daily 20-mile pleasure walk. Such a pace is more
itiring than the natural one of at least three. Per-
•sonally—and I am over 60 —I do 10 miles in three
hours with comfort, and I map out my trip so that
/Jie chief point of interest is half-way each day.
& Mart at 6 ; breakfast on road at 7 ; finish first half
at 10. Picnic till 2 ; this with tea interval allows
pl< inty of time to clean up before dinner. My
daughter accompanies me, and I carry sufficient
chrfcige of clothing for three days for both in a bag
con trived from the swagging experience of my early
day S. She carries the billies, etc. Clean clothing
(fov.*' lots) is sent on ahead before we start, and I
send 1 the soiled stuff home by parcel post. As we
walk along we plan our next jaunt, and if there is
any 1 letter way of appreciating the land we live in l
have y r et to learn it. •
“Morob": Although burial customs in New
Guinea .vary considerably (B. 9/10/’24), there are
many' p/hYs where the dead are planted in cemeteries
just as in more or less civilised countries. At the
back of a V. ill age in the Morobe district of the Man-
dated Tdrrifiiry, there is one of these native grave-
yards which,, judging by the numbers of bodies it
contains, must have been in use for a very long time.
As elsewhere, , the corpses are buried only a few
inches beneath V,the surface, and there is no attempt
at orderly arntn gement, one body sometimes being
thrown across another. Village pigs and dogs often
disinter a corpse,! and it may be days before what
is left of it is agiliin covered. The only custom that
seems to be regular*. 1 v observed in the burying of the
bodies is to wifcip tVem in mats before putting them
in the ground,/the body then presenting the appear-
ance of a long/'cylinclpr.
* ’ * * *
“Two Serte” : Ort, the trip round the west
coast of the ! Speck a favorite amusement consists of
tying pieces 'Of meat to* the rigging for the molly-
hawks to wrcfctle, with. They are tolerably success-
ful until the bait us fixed*where the up-draught from
the funnel strikes' it, and the frantic birds are
blown backwards. fThen tike betting starts, and the
strongest bird! wins. Not too exciting, but a change
from bullboai*! (whiVt a game!) and deck-quoits.
* ** * *
“F.A.L.”: Innitsfail (N.Q.), claimed by
“EAV.M.” (B. 25/9/’: 14) as the wettest town in Aus-
tralia, has been suffering from a drought compared to
Babinda, situated bf tween Cairns and Innisfail.
During the first eight months of the year the local
rain-gauge measured inches. Its top score
was in 1921, 273.27 ii tches.
* * * *
“Boronia”; The old saying that lightning
never strikes twice in tl te same place may be true;
but I know of one case where it went darned close
to it. About seven miles south of Bridgetown
(W.A.) there is a jarrah-tree which, though no taller
than its surrounding mates, bears two deep lightning
scars on opposite sides of its trunk. These originate
from two points about 15ft. apart on large limbs
at right angles to each other; and as one of the
scars is obviously the more recent, the two jolts
were not sustained during the same disturbance.
“Troophorse”; Recently some member of
the Council wanted information on the methods em-
plo37ed by Black Brother in making his bark canoes.
Round the N.T. side of the Gulf of Carpentaria the
niggers select a stout string.vbark-tree and remove
the big vegetable’s overcoat in long, broad strips.
One canoe I watched in the making measured 17it.
long, with a beam of over 2ft.
and was constructed on the fol-
lowing lines. One long sheet froin
bow to stern formed the port side,
then two strips were sewn together
to form the bottom and the star-
board side. Having proceeded to
this stage, the two sides of the
canoe were sewn together. At
each end and along the sides a
small strip was added to form the
bow and stern, which are also
raised, the bow being made higher
than the stern. Along each side
a thin, long branch of mangrove
wood is tied securely to the bark.
To prevent the sides from collaps-
ing outwards, the natives place a
couple of turns of native-made
rope across from side to side. Rope
is also used' to pinch in the bow
and stern. To prevent the sides
falling in, stout mangrove waddies
are arranged under the ropes from
side to side. After all the sewing
has been done, a sort of wax, pre-
pared from the roots of the iron-
wood-tree, is smeared over the
seams, and this, when it hardens,
is waterproof. All the rope and
twine used are made by hand from
various barks or pandanus leaves.
The natives will go out in any
weather in these bark canoes, and
on account of their lightness they are very handy in
a dugong hunt.
* * * *
“Tang-Aloli”: Talking of riding brumbies
barebacked, I wonder how many Abos. remember
that dare-devil rider, Sandy Cameron, of the Upper
Hunter away back in the early ’fifties? Sandy was
rather suspected of appropriating other people’s calves,
and one day while he and his brother were at their
stockyard they saw two police riding towards them.
There were a number of wild horses in the yard at
the time, and Sandy, mounting a gate-post, told
his brother to drive the brumbies out into the
open ; then as the horses rushed out, he leaped on to
the* back of one and went sailing off with the mob
into the bush, his presence among them causing a
most vigorous stampede. There were many miles
between him and the police when Sandy’s mount
steadied down, and he threw himself off.
* * * *
“P. Gee’': Mrs. Lance Rawson writes (B.
2/10/’24) that, judging by her own experience of
Fraser Island and Wide Bay natives of 40 years ago,
if white women ever were held captive after the
wreck of the Douglas Mawson, “the gins would not
have tolerated them
for more than one
day, and the men
would have killed them
for peace sake in the
camp.” Past records
show that Black Bro-
ther greatly prized,
and in some cases re-
vered, the white
stranger or captive,
and strongly objected
to him or her being
rescued. Oxley found
this out when in 1823
he rescued Pamphlet
and Finnegan, the first
white men to set eyes
on the Brisbane River,
from the Bribie Island
blacks. It was also
Andrew Petrie's ex-
perience in 1842 with
“Durrumboi” Davis.
And Mrs. Barba’/a
Thomson, who was
with the blacks 4 h
years, had to bribe her
captors with promises
of axes, knives, etc., to
row her from Eastern
Prince of Wales Island
to Cape York, where
H.M.S. Rattlesnake was
anchored, in 1849. So if the women from the
Mawson have landed there is a fair chance of their
lives being spared by the natives.
* * * *
“Centre”: One more for the foster-mother
debate. A small female monkey from Japan was
given to a friend of mine in Toowong (Q.). The
little lady was lonely, and howled mournfully for
companionship until the cat had kittens. Then, in
spite of Ma’s watchful eye, she managed to kidnap
one of the family. The kitten was rescued from the
branches of a peach-tree, up which the monkey could
go with her chain, and returned to its mother. Ma
sniffed it suspiciously, but gave it a wash and sup-
per. A week later the kidnapping was repeated,
the same kitten being taken. The lonely one kept
it for the greater part of the day, actually suckling
it, with apparently satisfactory results to both. The
matter was righted in the evening, but Ma would
have no truck with the wanderer after its second
vanishing. One sniff at the little beggar, and it
was clouted out of the basket, and refused both
bed and board. The outcast was promptly claimed by
the ladj' monk., who reared it to full-grown cat-
hood, with a taste for ripe bananas and a trick of
standing up on its hind legs when trying to see any
distant object.
“Morob”: Black Brother of the North
possesses a fairly useful pharmacopoeia of vegetable
origin. Amongst his most valuable preparations is
one employed for the treatment of bronchial com-
plaints ; it is made from the exudate of a tree grow-
ing in those parts. Another is used for the relief
of pain. The latter owes its properties to the pre-
sense of an alkaloid which closely resembles
the Duboisine found in certain other plants. The
preparation employed by the New Guinea natives
for the treatment of gonorrhoea is also known to the
North Australian natives, who make it in exactly
the same way.
“X.E.V.”: The lad who is lucky enough
to have me for a boss w T as going into town on his
usual week-end, and I asked him to get back early
on Sunday. He protested—he had to go to church.
My incredulous laugh brought a confession. “You
see, it’s Nellie. She says we oughta go ter church
Sunday—ter make up for the night before!’’
“Gouger”: A grim old witchdoctor of my
acquaintance possesses a line of reasoning which
reminds me of his more civilised white brothers.
When asked why he had “pointed the bone” which
caused the death of a villager utterly innocent of
stealing another man’s pig, he replied in lingo:
“Someone had to suffer for the real culprit’s sin.
Custom and the -tribe demanded it. I did not know
the swine who stole the pig. The man who suffered
was the most unpopular in the village. Nobody loved
him. Also many owed him of taro, fish and pigs.
Therefore there was not one to kick up a row when
he died. He eared least of any, because now he
sleeps. Everyone is satisfied except the strange mind
of the white man, and that does not matter at all.”
* * * *
“Akran” : The customer who has blewed his
cheque and has nothing left but a raging thirst
and a dilapidated appearance is no ornament to a
pub verandah, and various methods are employed
by the out-back Bung to shift the shiftless ones.
The strangest mode of persuasion I’ve ever seen
was that devised by a N.Q. publican. He kept a
couple of alligators in a pool at the back of his
joint, and when a shearer or drover had spent his
last sprat, Bung would take the dingbatty one round
to the pool and give him an introduction to the
saurians. The sozzled chap would nearly always
hit out for the bush without looking behind him.
* * * *
“Herodot”: While old dingoes always
howl when communicating with one another, or when
they feel the urge to express themselves, the younger
ones, especially those that have just grown out of
puppyhood, give utterance to a bark which is exactly
the same as that of the, tame dog. Of course they
howl too; but I should say that they bark or yelp
as often as they howl.
THE APPEAL TO CJESAR.
MDM: “Dad, speak to Dave! He won’t say grace.”
DAD : “Now, Dave, what’s this blanky nonsense? Give thanks,
dammit!”
“Cwrw Bach”: I haven’t heard of any
saw-millers objecting to “Flandowsia” (B. 25/9/’24 ),
but I do know Bananaland halls where roller skating
is allowed on floors of this wood. Is there any other
kind of wooden floor that will stand this and remain
fit for dancing? ■*.
*** * '
“Xenophon”: Does this happen often ? A
Plymouth Rock set on 15 eggs at Goodna (Q.) and
hatched out 16 chickens, all well and strong. A
black cne and a white one had shared a shell in
which there must have been an extra supply of
chicken-food to keep both going.
THE OLD-TIME SHEARER GUNS.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
I sat to-night with the old-time guns who eat with
the rousies now—
The grand old men too good to dine in the riff-raffs’
meal-time row.
Their backs are stiff, but they made the game in
the years not long ago;
They smoothed out things for the young speed-kings
who’ve mastered the longer blow.
They sit there now at the shed-hands’ mess and
hope for a twelve-quid shed;
And a smile lights up their fueled eyes when the
rain shows overhead.
And yet they have spun for a thousand sheep when
the ring man called out “Set,”
And tramped away, as a ringer could, stone-broke,
but never in debt.
They have flung good quids in an offhand way to
their fly-blown gambling pals;
They have written their names for healthy subs, to
the local hospitals.
But they paid no heed in their palmy days to the
older men’s advice,
And now they sweep outside the gate of a shearer’s
paradise.
There are some won’t work with the motor-hogs
who shear in the contract teams,
Mho “bange” long days on billabongs, or camp on
the clear bore-streams,
To eat out cheques that they drag away from the
filth of the marking-pen ;
And some strain wires on the boundary lines for a
paltry three-pound-ten.
But these who eat with the “bag-boot mob” and
sweep for the youths who shear —-
Who break all union rules and “chin” in the
organiser's ear—
They can t live far from the slick machines, the
call of the smoke-oh bell.
The sheds are the homes of the old-time guns—they
live on the great yolk smell.

THE RED PAGE’S OFFSIDER.
Why Am I so Clever?
That question has been puzzling me for
some years. At one time I was quite certain
that it was because I was so good. I was
young and saintly then, and would not allow
myself to do any of the delightfully wicked
tilings that humanity is so prone to. I had
never smoked a cigarette, or drunk a glass
of beer, or cuddled a careless maid. I
had not even uttered a damn, or kissed a
sweetheart. I was good and was assured
that all my cleverness was but a reward for
my goodness. But after a time I met other
people who were clever, too. Many were
almost as clever as I was; some were more
so; and none of these people were at all
good. It seemed to me that the most clever
of them were the most wicked. It made
me a little ashamed of my goodness, so I
experimented in sin. I found sinning not
quite so satisfying as I had been told it
was, but it left my intellectual brilliancy
undimmed.
Then I went to College and decided that
I was clever because I was studious. I
certainly was studious, but there were other
studious people, and some of them were
painfully dull. In fact, I noticed that the
most studious people were most dull. I
also noticed a number of men who scorned
studious or industrious pursuits and were
yet puzzlingly clever. So I experimented
in laziness. This experiment lasted a long
time, and my cleverness grew apace, not
seeming to be at all retarded by my ever-
increasing indolence. I never studied. I
read only for pleasure, and only what was
easy to read. I decided not to do any work
also, and managed to avoid it for quite a
long time. In fact, I became so lazy and
so surpassingly clever at the same time
that I decided I was clever because I was
lazy, and that cleverness could be deter-
mined in direct ratio to laziness. There is
something to be said for this view, but
nothing to be said for its practice. Laziness
does give one more time for cleverness, but
it tends to keep one rather hungry, which
is unpleasant. Eventually, I was forced to
cease my pursuit of clever laziness, and I
then found that industrious cleverness was
quite as interesting, and far more remu-
nerative. But I had not found out why I
was clever.
I asked a friend once, and he tried to
explain it all to me. 110 made it sound so
simple and so plausible that it was unbe-
lievable. He told me that I had lived many
lives, having passed through innumerable
incarnations. In each I had developed a
certain amount of cleverness, and this kept
adding up, so that now I had come into
this life with all the cleverness of many
lives ready to my hand, or mind, or pen,
or tongue, or whatever else seems most fit-
ting. I wondered how he knew all that.
He just said that he knew, and that I would
know, too, when I had progressed as far
as he had. That sounded more like explain-
ing and revealing his own cleverness than
mine, so I was set against him and his
explanation immediately.
Some people to whom I have told this
worry have assured me that I inherited it
all from my parents. They were people who
did not know my parents. My parents were
not clever —showed no sign of ever having
been, and no promise of ever becoming so.
My father never did or said or thought a
clever thing in all his life. He will not
contradict this, for he never reads This
Bulletin —which proves my statement.
My mother is a thoroughly conventional,
drab little person whose only clever act
consisted in giving birth to me. That one
magnificent burst of brilliancy seems to have
exhausted her store of originality. So I am
sure I did not inherit my cleverness from
my parents.
It may be thought that I have acquired
it; but who was there for me to acquire it
from? In the last few years I have cer-
tainly read some books written by very
clever men, but my own cleverness had been
astounding me for years before these men
wrote their books. I had been treated as
a genius by my playmates in cbildbood,
lionised as an intellectual giant at College—
all before these other Great Minds were
known to me. I may have become a little
more brilliant since reading their books, but
I think I would have made about the same
triumphal progress in any case. Genius is
not acquired.
There is only one explanation that seems
to bear the confirmation of science. It may
be that I am clever because I am conceited.
I seem to have commenced life with the
firm conviction that I was “a monstrous
clever fellow.” That conceit could well have
become auto-suggestive, and may have oper-
ated so powerfully on my sub-conscious mind
as to actually account for the phenomenon.
But where did the conceit come from?
Some misguided readers may say that I
am not really clever, and that all this fuss
and worry is over nothing. I will not argue
over the obvious; but, even admitting that I
myself am not clever, surely someone is.
It may be the reader. Well, then, why are
you so clever? Why are the other illustrious
men of the world so clever? What is it that
condemns a few people to a life of transcen-
dent intellectuality, while the rest of human-
ity moves on its even way. undistressed by
the disquieting contemplation of distinctly
salutary qualities? I really want to know.
Is any one clever enough to tell me?
LESTER WAY.
An Almost Forgotten Epic
In 1872 there appeared a striking epic of
Maori life written by Alfred Domett. Born
in 1811, Domett entered Cambridge in 1829,
but left without graduating. A wanderer
always, he visited America and the Conti-
nent, writing largely for magazines, and in
1839 he published a poem, “Venice.” Then
lie returned to England, settled somewhat to
study and was called to the Bar in 1841.
The wandering spirit stirred again, and in
the following year he left his friends in a
most abrupt manner. This we gather from
Robert Browning, his intimate friend, who
in the poem “Waring” apostrophises the
absent one:—
What’s become of Waring
Since lie gave us all the slip,
Chose land-travel or seafaring
Boots and chest, or staff and scrip,
Rather than pace up and down
Any longer London Town?
In Maoriland Domett entered the Govern-
ment service and then politics, and was Pre-
mier from August, 1862, to October, 1862.
In 1871 he returned to England, taking with
him the M'S. of his epic, “Ranolf and
Amoliia.” He died in London in 1887.
The epic is of the romantically idyllic
type:—
If, weary of mists, you will roam undisdaining
To a land where the fanciful fountains are raining
Swift brilliants of boiling and beautiful spray
In the violet splendor of skies that illume
Such a wealth of green, ferns and rare crimson-tree
bloom,
Where a people primeval is vanishing fast,
With its faiths and its fables and ways of the past—
Oh! with reason and fancy unfettered and fearless,
Come, plunge with us deep into regions of day,
Come away ! Come away !
It deals with the meeting, the courtship and
the love of Randolph (Ranolf), a castaway
Highland sailor, and Amoliia, the beautiful
daughter of a chief, Tangi-Moana (The Wail-
ing Sea). The scene is laid around Rotorua,
and by a piece of good fortune it has en-
shrined for us the delicate loveliness of the
Pink and White Terraces and all the neigh-
boring marvels swept away in the upheaval
that destroyed so much beauty in June, 1886
-—the year before Domett’s death. When
it was first published, Browning, Tennyson
and Longfellow wrote in eulogistic strain.
Tennyson thus summed up: “Intellectual
subtlety, great power of delineating delicious
scenery, imaginative fire —all these are
there; nevertheless, I find in it an embarrass-
ment of riches which makes it a little diffi-
cult to read—to me, at least.” Tennyson
was right: there is a redundance of good
things and it is difficult to read, but the de-
scriptive power and beauty are unassailable.
Longfellow was equally eulogistic—“ You have
sent me,” he wrote, “a splendid poem. There
is ample space in it to move and breathe.
Your descriptions of scenery are very power-
ful and beautiful.” All this is true, but the
metres make the reading difficult. The many
changes and the cropping up of rhyming lines
in the midst of blank verse make for con-
fusion.
The first canto traverses the many religious
forms and faiths met by Ranolf in his world-
wanderings as a sailor. Then, shipwrecked,
he effects the rescue of Amoliia from two
young Maoris of another tribe and is taken
by her to her father, the great chief. Domett
limns him strongly:—
Such was this Tangi—-The Wailing Sea;
Of form almost gigantic he,
Bull-necked, square-jawed, firm-lipped, bold-eyed,
broad-browed,
His looks proclaimed his character aloud;
And When he stood forth in full height and pride
In flowing robe of silky flax, undyed,
But crimson-spotted with round knobs of wool,
Its skirt’s broad rim tan-hued ; his snowy hair
Crowned with a jet-black arching crest
Of hoopoe’s feathers stuck upright,
Their tips a crescent of pure white;
And in his hand, to order or to smite,
The greenstone batlet broad of war or rule,
Green, smooth and oval as a cactus leaf,
Did he not look aye every inch a chief?
Did not each glance and gesture stamp him then,
Self-heralded, a God-made king of men?
Almost coincident with Ranolf’s arrival
comes news of the death through a land-
slide of Te Rehu, Amohia’s betrothed, on
whose account she has been tabu from child-
hood. Ranolf and Amoliia sit side by side at
the feast and are watched by Kangapo, the
priest, who already contemplates marriage
for Amoliia with the son of a powerful chief,
Pomare. Leaving the feast, Ranolf is am-
bushed by Kangapo’s orders and thrown,
bound, into the tribe’s great council cham-
ber, the Whare-Kura, hall of justice and'wor-
ship. A voice rouses him, and Amoliia, with a
whispered “Make no sound but come,” cuts
his cords and leads him out. They part, but
he is joined by Amoliia, who, returning to
her father, had overheard Kangapo’s sugges-
tion of a fresh betrothal. Dreading the con-
sequent tabu, she determines to throw in her
lot with the attractive stranger. In their
wanderings the pair come to the Hot Springs
district, and here comes in Domett’s descrip-
tion of the Terraces :
From the low skyline of the hilly range
Before them, sweeping down its dark-green face
Into the lake that slumbered at its base,
A mighty cataract—or so it seemed
Over a hundred steps of marble streamed
And gushed, or fell in dripping overflow.
All rosy-liued it seemed with sunset’s glow.
But what is this? No roar, no sound
Disturbs the torrent’s hush profound.
The wanderers near, and nearer come
Still is the mighty cataract dumb!
They paddle past, and on the right
Another cataract comes in sight,
Another broader, grander flight
Of steps—all stainless, snowy white.
They land, their curious way they track
Near thickets made by contrast black,
And then that wonder seems to be
A cataract carved in parian stone.
And, as they gain a rugged road
And cautious climb the solid rime,
Bach step becomes a terrace broad,
Bach terrace a wide basin brimmed
With water, brilliant yet in hue,
The tenderest, delicate hare-bell blue
Deepening to violet....
Having “passed tlieir wild honeymoon, home-
ward to Rotorua came the pair.” Kangapo,
unable to stir Tangi Moan a to revenge,
leaves the tribe and, calling together
Amohia’s disgruntled lovers and their follow-
ers, makes war upon the old chief. Tangi’s
pah is stormed. Kangapo’s forces, led by
Wheteturi (Angry Star), take the first palis-
ade without enticing Tangi forth ; but when
they, seemingly carrying all before them,
reach the second palisade,
Then out! unable to restrain
His pent up wrath, his fierce disdain,
Or patient wait his foe’s attack,
With’all his bravest at his back,
Just as the glorious sun again
Slipped silvery from the, mountain’s black
With panting disc upfloating free,
Out rushed at last the Wailing Sea
In wild, ferocious majesty,
His battle cry resounding loud
Above the tumult of the crowd:
“Now forward! now my sons with me!”
Ranolf leads the final sortie and would have
been slain by Angry Star had not Tangi
come to his help, and together they gain the
shelter of the pah. As a last resource the
pah is fired; but the women, led by Amohia,
carry water in gourds and a canoe, and the
flames are subdued. The foe is defeated, but
the old chief never rallies from his wounds,
The lovers, fearing each to bind the other
in bonds that may be irksome, attempt to
hide the emotions that possess them. Amohia
feels that Ranolf ought to be free to return
to his own people. When she hears of a
rising among a northern tribe, friends of her
father, she determines to go to them and
thus set him free. She goes, and is reported
drowned. Going to the north to seek a ship,
Ranolf comes across a tribe who hold her a
prisoner. The lovers decide to hoodwink
the tribe by pretending to be strangers. The
stratagem succeeds and Ranolf goes openly
to the coast, Avliile Amohia follows secretly,
and, with the captain’s connivance, is rowed
to the \ r essel: —
So with its loving freight to scenes untold
As daybreak wrapt her in its rosy fold,
As down and down, beneath the horizon’s brink,
Hull, sails and masts, did that lone vessel sink
And melt into the flood of morning gold,
The husband-lover and the lover-wife
Dipped down into the chequered deep of life.
So vanished, gliding down the blue hill-slope
Of ocean, into an abyss of hope.
WINNIE FAIRWEATHER.
The Trade of Fiction
I have hated books.
All my life I have had to read the things,
and write about what was in them, and get
paid for it. Occasionally I have written
some myself, just to see how it feels. Now,
however, I am free from my shackles and
enfranchised from the pains and penalties of
being a reviewer. In these days I can read
a book for the mere pleasure of reading it;
and gradually, very gradually, I am getting
to like books again.
The sensation is akin to that of a theatri-
cal critic. He has to sit out two-tliirds of
a play that nobody has warned him against;
he has to make notes, in the darkness of the
auditorium, on his programme—and later on
finds that he can’t read them because he has
scribbled them all in the same place. He
has to take the last act for granted, hoping
fervently that nobody will dynamite the hero
at the final curtain, a deserving case though
he be. Then he hastens to his office and
feverishly turns in a “notice” about the show,
and has to cut it down to oue-tliird of his
allotted space to make room for a murder.
Dramatic criticism, like literary criticism,
is just yakker—a job to be done without any
let up.
Occasionally, however, I happen into a
theatre to see a play that I haven’t criti-
cised ; and there is a rare delight in sitting
comfortably back in the stalls, forgetting to
look at my programme, caring nothing for
the expertness or the charm of the actor or
the cleverness of the author, and letting the
play, with all its faults and its surprises,
just soak in.
That is the happy position in which I find
myself to-day with the world of books. I
haven’t to “do” a big book in a hurry ; I
haven’t to “do” a book at all. I can idly
pick up any book and read it, as all books
should be read, with my alleged critical sense
dormant. It is surprising to me how delight-
ful some books are when I haven’t to praise
the good things in them or detect the faults.
And I feel that I am gradually getting to
that felicitous state of mind when a book is
a book to be read for the pleasure it will
give. It is astonishing when you let your-
self go, at the author’s pleasure, how delight-
ful mere reading really is. I am rediscover-
ing a lost joy.
All this literary criticism, in magazines
and in papers, is, I feel now, an immense
mistake. People don’t regal’d books, as we
critics and ex-critics are apt to do, as the
product of artists doing a rather clever and
difficult job. All the brilliance and artistic
construction of the author does not matter, to
the generality of readers, a row of safety-
pins. The lucid language of the work, the
beauty of the descriptive passages, the con-
struction, the theme, the character-drawing,
the dialogue, and the commentary of the
author’s philosophy behind it all, count for
nothing with the book-reading public. For
them a book is only the printed word, and
possibly the picture on the cover. What does
it matter to the public whether a book is
well or ill written? Fiction-hounds read a
book for its story; and their ultimate judg-
ment on the novel depends solely on whether
they liked or didn’t like the story.
All human lives end in death. Every-
where and in every period of the world’s His-
tory people come to an end by dying. But
the novel-reader refuses to allow his hero
or his heroine to die—as he or she ulti-
mately must. These characters in books are
left suspended in the last chapter, stationary,
unchanging, unsusceptible to humanity’s
common end. Thus it is that, though the
logical ending of any character in a book is
death —and only by a complete working out
of the personality until it ends can a genuine
and just estimate be made of any character
—the public delights to leave the heroine
gazing ecstatically up into the eyes of the
big strong man, and being tremendously and
thoroughly hugged. Poor girl! She doesn’t
know that when he tells her he loves her and
has always loved her, and will always love
her, she is going to settle down into the
dulness of matrimony, and have children, and
have to bring them up and see them go out
into the world on their own concerns.
The public has been through all that;
that is why it turns to the novels that guar-
antee at least two imaginary characters in
fiction perfect bliss for ever. That is why
the public, which has an unhappy ending,
insists on something so much better.'
No; it is for the story, no matter how
badly told, or how false to life, that the
novel-reading public reads fiction. If a story
has got a punch in it, a nice girl in it, a he-
man in it, a romance in it, adventure in it,
you can shove your Conrads and your Arlens
into their hands, but they won’t have them.
The obvious fact is that the great novel-
reading public buys or borrows books just
as it buys or borrows lawn-mowers. To the
public a book is merely a commodity, some-
thing to be consumed in the shortest possible
time. The public eats novels just as it eats
eggs. Eggs are just eggs, and novels are just
novels. Novels have brands upon them;
and the public goes always for the best-seller
brand. The novel-digesters do not listen to
anybody who analyses the insides of the
books they feed on. They know that if they
stick to a recognised brand of fiction they
will never get ptomaine poisoning. The public
gulps novels as it gulps aspirins. Fiction
is a sedative, not an art. And its chief
value is that it passes the time away. In
this modern life of ours time is the one thing
that must be got rid of.
ARTHUR H. ADAMS.
The Art of Wooing
This is the age of formula. Life has be-
come so complex, so exacting, that origi-
nality has to be eliminated and formula:
substituted. One might have thought that
the tyrant of modern pressure, the god
Hustle, might at least have left to the lover
a little leisure to adjust his wooing to such
ideals of love-making as his own tempera-
mental make-up might suggest. No, there
is no time for such dalliance nowadays.
There are so many other things to -worry
about —such a continuous buzz of human
activities, of scientific tortures, ’phones, wire-
less and the rest —that the young man has
no time to sit down and write verses to his
love or coin pretty phrases about violets
and her eyes. He can buy all the sentiment
he wants for a florin at a bookstall, and the
complete voyage to the harbor of matrimony
is charted out for him at the price of an-
other coin. That is the one thing he need
not worry about—“ How to get married.”
Everyone is out to help him; all the vices
and the virtues combine to get him there.
A gentleman by the name of Robin Wise
has written a book, chastely bound in a
white cover, entitled How to Make Love, in
mix Easy Lessons (T. Werner Laurie) *
and “it is with no little pride that he offers
this little manual to the public,” says the
preface. The Professor is at one with Mr.
Bernard Shaw, tvho bluntly declared that
Diana has always been, and always will be,
the huntress. “He [poor fox]* has been
the hunted since he was chased out of the
Garden of Eden, but rarely before in the,
history of the world has liis ignominious
position been so manifest as to-day. He has
merely to take the same girl twice to the
cinema for the horn to be sounded.” Nature
for her own purpose has cast a dazzling veil
over the eyes of youth, hiding from him the
obvious truth. It is only to-day he is pull-
ing it aside. “It is, then,” observes the
learned Professor, “no matter for wonder
that the modern male, astonished and
alarmed, should retire within himself for
contemplation.” Poor, sensitive male, wilt-
ing at the touch of the aggressive she! He
becomes dubious, hesitant, suspicious of nets
and gins and traps, till soon even in the
chocolate-box. he looks for some insidious
snare. “He is so bemused with being loved,”
says the Professor, “that he forgets to love.”
Why he should worry about it when Diana
is prepared to do the lot is not apparent.
But we must postulate she does expect
something in that way, or there would be
no need for text-books. “In bygone, days,”
he says .with a suppressed sigh, “the modest
maid with a sweet and trustful simplicity
prayed for love. Her more sophisticated
modern counterpart preys for it.”
The Professor then demonstrates “how it
is possible to play pleasantly with love with-
out either getting burnt or acquiring cold
feet in the process.”
Lesson I.— The Material: Consider your girl. Is
she short or tall, fat or thin, jolly or glum, pretty
or plain? Much depends on this. “A plump girl
usually is placid; a thin —or shall we say slender ? —-
girl not infrequently is passionate. A girl who
turns her toes in is almost invariably very passionate.’’
Koto: The jolly girl, usuallv plump, is :i heaitv
eater. Consult your purse. The glum girl “casts
a gloom all round her,” but seemingly is not so
voracious. The fast girl is an adventure—with the
Divorce Court in the distance. But the slow girl
doesn’t always stay slow—don’t think it.
Lf.ssox TT.— The Kiss: “The springtime kiss should
never—well, hardly ever—be passionate ; it should
merely be the promise of better kisses in store, ft
is in winter that the kiss calls for the greatest art
and abandon. A fool may kiss in the springtime
and catch the pleasure of paradise; in winter (if
he be a fool) he may catch nothing more pleasant
than influenza.”
Lesson lll.—This lesson is really very unfair, for
it puts the female up to a lot of dodges that may
not be in every woman’s armory; indeed, at this
point the Professor seems to have stumbled into the
net himself and have gone over to the enemy. Even
he, the fount of wisdom, has not escaped Diana.
However, as few students will have eluded
capture beyond Lesson 11, the balance may
be regarded as negligible.
T. B. C.
A Satchel of Books
11. G. Wells, by Ivor Brown (Nisbet). One of
the “Writers of the Day” series, which will meet a
want. Brown’s book is for hero-worshippers; and
after all these fan the flame of Betters. His sub-
ject is treated biographically and critically; the best
bits are in “The Hope That Is in History.”
The Canon’s Dilemma, by Victor L. Whitechurch
(Fisher Unwin). Short stories, the title serving
as an index of the contents. The Canon has his
dilemma, the Vicar his legacy, the Archdeacon his
visitation, the Minister his bargain,, and the Bishop
his sea-dip. All this ecclesiasticism is tempered
by a flow of genial humor which makes the' secular
reader feel less an outsider than he otherwise might.
Quite a good book for odd moments.
The Lyre-birds of Mount Buffalo (Robertson and
Mullens). A beautiful long-octavo album of nine
photographs by “Guide Alice,” with delightful anno-
tations by her and an introduction by Charles' Bar-
rett. “Guide Alice” is herself attractively pictured
in mountaineering costume. “She has fame as a
guide ; as a Bush Naturalist she deserves praise, too,”
says Barrett. The photos were not obtained without
risk, and the male lyre-birdwas particularly hard
to “bag.” In a crevice on the edge of a cliff 1700 ft.
high the birds nested. You are shown the gorge
and the nursery, and the birds in poses that ravish
the eye. The explanatory “notes” make reading as
fascinating as fairy-stories. The whole atmosphere
of the portfolio is romantic. Tried on the family
circle there is warrant, for believing that “Guide
Alice” and her lovely friends would get right into
good Australian hearts.
Equality and Fraternity, bv Douglas Macleane
(Allen and Unwin). The author, a canon of Salis-
bury Cathedral, has collected a large body of material,
secular and religious, to illustrate his thesis. The
conclusion he draws is that “Brotherhood cannot
emerge from atomic confusion, but only exists as
involved in a divinely ordered family life—a home of
discipline, duty, and common devotion; a place of
security in which each has his or her assigned
ministration, work and office; a body wherein head,
hand and foot supply what is lacking to each other,
without pretending to equality of function.” The
Canon lightens the heavier matter of his pages by
illustrative anecdote, and has, on occasion, a good-
humored thrust at his fellow clerics. He quotes the
case of a poor negro who was excluded from a select
sanctuary and advised to bring his trouble before
God. He did and reported that the Almighty said in
reply: “Nebber mind, Sambo, I have been trying
myself to get into that there church for 10 years,
but I nebber had no luck.”

THIS TUDOR BATTERY, comprising 314
cells and capable of delivering 5832
amperes for one hour, was supplied to
the Sydney Municipal Council in 1915 for
their Phillip Street sub-station. The Council
has now placed a further order with the Tudor
Accumulator Co., Ltd., for the supply of a
still larger battery, comprising 300 cells and
capable of delivering 6696 amperes for one
hour, to be installed in the Castlereagh Street
sub-station.
This is another of the many cases all
over the world where Tudor Accumulators
have been chosen on account of their proved
reliability.
5832 Amperes per one hour.

“Marko”: Moving with the times, or ex-
pressiveness up to date? A firm dismissed
one of its salesmen the other day because
the sales manager had reported on him that
he “couldn’t sell a sandbag in Fitzroy.”
* * * *
“Two Seas”: It’s an ill wind that blows
no coppers into the collection-boxes of the
Salvation Army. Down south some of the
hard-up sports clubs dodge the amusement
tax by charging Hid. instead of the usual
bob for admission, and the patient Hallelujah
lassie stands between the ticket-office and
the gate gathering in the odd ha’pence.

“H.H.”: Australian industry scored a
point when the Footscray (Melb.) Council
was forced by a public outcry to reconsider
a decision to buy an imported steam road-
roller. An Australian roller, oil-driven, was
given a demonstration to show its quality.
It is £lOO dearer than the English
juggernaut, but the trial showed that the
Australian was much cheaper to run.

“Yardley” : The G.P.O. deserves an occa-
sional bouquet among the bricks that ily
at it. To-day I received a letter from London.
My name and street were correctly set forth
on the envelope, but not the name of the
town—merely that of the State, Victoria.
I might have expected the letter to reach me
sooner or later, perhaps, but inclusion in the
first delivery of the mail suggests unex-
pected resource on some sorter’s part.

“Cartot” : Both “Nux Vomica” and “Mag.
Sulph.” are wrong when they deny in general
terms that counter-prescribing is forbidden
by law in most of the States of Australia
<B. 16/10/’24). In Victoria the V.D. Act
imposes severe penalties on
chemists convicted of treat-
ing venereal disease in any
form. In Queensland an
amendment of the Health Act
has prohibited anybody not a
registered medical practitioner
from prescribing the drugs of
the British Pharmacopoeia
and its addenda, and in
N.S.W. chemists are forbidden
to prescribe for certain dis-
eases. Diagnosing and treat-
ing disease is no part of the
chemist’s job; in the course
of instruction which he is re-
quired to undergo no provi-
ison is made for such things.
He is given no instruction con-
cerning the human body,
symptomology, therapeutics
or anything of this sort; his
work is simply to compound
medicines. Of his four years’
apprenticeship the first is
spent in washing bottles and
learning the names on them,
the second and third in an
intensive study of soaps, per-
fumes, face powders and the
like; the fourth year in at-
tending a short course of lec-
tures on simple chemistry,
botany, materia medica and
pharmacy, In N.S.W. these
are certainly delivered at the
University, but only because
there is no separate College of
Pharmacy in this State, as
there is in Victoria and
Queensland. There is only
one place where medicine can be studied,
and that is in the wards of a hospital, sup-
plemented by instruction in a medical school;
the pharmacist has no more access to these
than a linendraper has.

“Sturt”: Adelaide detectives stated that
accused ‘for about three months had fol-
lowed no lawful occupation, and had fre-
quented the streets in the company of con-
victed persons; he said he had been clerking
for a couple of bookmakers.” Counsel sub-
mitted that liis client’s occupation was “to
acquire and dispense information to punters
in connection with horseracing.” The Court
held that accused had a lawful "occupation.

“Clerk”: Vic. Railways Commissioner
Clapp is manifesting a laudable desire to
help Australian industries. At his direction
a letter was recently sent to Hume Cook, the
secretary of the Australian Industries Pro-
tection League, asking for a list of Austra-
lian manufacturers who might be able to
furnish some of the departmental require-
ments. The idea calls for imitation in other
States and departments. Further, it sug-
gests one advantage, anyhow, of getting men
who have been trained in Uncle Sam’s
country.

“Marko”: On one of the most heavily-
loaded transports that left England for Aus-
tralia after the war, a muster of gambling
apparatus the first day out revealed only one
set of “House.” This was in the possession
of Private Robinson. That night Robbo
operated and scooped £80; next day he was
offered £5 for _ the use of the set. and
accepted ; the third day competition started,
and eventually Robbo was sitting back and
doing nothing but rake in £25 per day, Sun-
days included, merely for the use of his outfit.
He played only once himself.
“The Deacon”: A better proposition than
putting the boy on the soil would be to
apprentice him to the trade of those who
eventually put him in. Among unforeseen
N.S.W. expenditure last year was £7S3 for
the State funeral of late Governor Davidson.
The State funeral granted to Senator E. D.
Millen cost the patient taxpayer just £400;
and it is common for private interments to
pass £lOO. There seem no limits to which
Ghoul is confined; and I suggest that he be
put on the same footing in this respect as
his brother Shark, LL.B., who at least
always has a taxing-master in his mind’s eye.

“Moonah”: When P. J. Conlon went to
Tasmania a dozen years or so ago he found
the local dairyman a most unwilling pupil.
His mixed breeds of cows were good enough
for him, he had no doubts about the cleanli-
ness of his methods, and he didn’t want in-
spectors poking about his dairy. However,
Conlon continued to preach better herds and
cleaner methods, and now Minister of Agri-
culture Belton tells the Assembly that last
year the butter produced in the Speck was
<7 per cent, choicest, whereas only 20 per
cent, of it had been so graded five years ago.
* * * *
“Harold Hardupp”: The Vic. railway
authorities have an uncomfortable feeling
that a leak only just discoverer! may have
much to answer for. A porter was recently
convicted of having made out a waybill for
an imaginary parcel despatched to a relative
at Bendigo; he subsequently claimed, and
obtained, £7 10s. compensation when the
non-existent goods were not delivered. The
suspicion has been awakened that this inci-
dent may explain the rather alarming in-
crease in the claims for undelivered parcels,
which have been vanishing lately in large
quantities. The solder for the hole is to be
a closer watch on the officers who make out
the waybills.

The shipbreakers are to have
the Aramac, which has made 507 voyages on
the Australian coast since she left Denny
Bros, yards, Dumbarton, Scotland, in 1889.
On her maiden voyage, carrying mails from
London to Brisbane via Torres Strait, she
beat the contract time to Thursday Island
by four days and to Brisbane by eight. In
the same year she took up the Melbourne to
Cooktown (Q.) run, and later went to Cairns
only. She left this service to flog between

came to serious trouble was in 1904, when
she struck Breaksea Spit, and a full comple-
ment of passengers had to be transferred to
the boats.

n : temperance drinks have their
perils, too. At a recent conference of S.
Aus. fruitgrowers and market gardeners ; t
was decided to ask the State Government for
an analysis of some of the alleged fruit
products. Victorian analyst Wilkinson selec-
ted 44 various makes of raspberry cordial
and found only one, unadulterated with coal
tar dyes or cochineal (for coloring), salicvlic-
acid (for a preservative), or saccharine '(for
sweetening purposes). Yet the single un
adulterated sample was pronounced far better
than all others m color, flavor and aroma!
S Were used in cordials
labelled with fruit names, and chemicals
eschewed, it would be better for both grower
and consumer. 61

Morehead”: The radio boom is respon-
sible for the creation of a new profession.
The man who booms out the concert pro-
grammes, market reports, sport results,
weather forecasts and other news broad-
casted by the wireless companies is called
an “announcer.” The field is restricted as
yet, for there are hardly half a dozen
stations in Australia giving broadcast-
ing entertainments; but it is growing,
and there are plenty who want to hop in
early. A Sydney company recently adver-
tised for an “announcer,” and the first mail
brought close on a hundred applications.
The candidates included an actor, a picture-
show . spruiker, a parson, a well-known
Domain orator, a motor-’bus-conductor, a
hawker and a hopeful young man who prof-
fered as his credentials the assurance that
lie had done a lot of football barracking.

“II.H.”; Although Melbourne lacks the
soaring blocks which cut oblong chips out
ot the Sydney skyscape, it lias been thinking
largely in flats; and some comfortable in-
vestments have been made in this type of
building. A South Yarra woman has eight
suites that bring her £24 per week for an
outlay of £5OOO. But since she hopped in
the business has been overdone, with the
usual results. Aspiring builders on St.
Ivilda-road fondly thought to keep one pile
select by charging 12 guineas. The price
has already been almost halved, and the
flats remain so empty that the owners may
presently be inclined to accept something
in reason—say, £3. The fact is Melbourne
is already full of empty flats, and many
speculators who have rushed to convert old
buildings are likely to see tlieir dreams of
big rentals shattered.

T. Cymbal” : I don’t know whether the
garnet deposits at Cape York, referred to
in recent pars., are of any present commercial
value, but I do know that there are thousands
oi Australian users of garnets in a manufac-
tured form. Nearly every woodworker runs
a so-called sandcr ’ for putting a finish on
ms jobs, and the principal part of a sunder
is a cloth or paper belt encrusted with gar-
nets of various standard “grits”—an im-
proved form of the old-fashioned sand-
paper. Similar cloths and papers are largely
used in the bootniaking trade. For instance,
nearly every “wliile-you-wait” boot-repairing
mitfit lias a garnet-covered wheel for finish-
ing heels, etc. Uncle Sam supplies practically
all our requirements in this line, but there
are English and Continental manufacturers,
also. .By the way, Henry Ford owns a gar-
net mine and 111 bet he doesn’t keep it to
look at.

The Traveller”.: The whole system of live-
stock traffic by rail in Australia needs revis-
ing. The present method is not suitable in
a country of such big distances. Even in
little Victoria live stock are often too long
m the trucks without food, water or chance
of getting off their feet. The sheep sales are
conducted at Newmarket on Tuesdays. Fre-
quently sheep for these auctions are loaded
at long-distance stations on the Saturday
previous, and are in the yards on the Friday
afternoon. They may get to Newmarket on
Sunday morning, and be unloaded into bare,
stone-paved yards; and they are not out of
them, in most instances, until they go to the
abattoirs. It is considered a good thing in
some slaughter-yards to have the stock come
in empty. There is not so much offal! Isn’t
it possible to practise economy without being
brutal?
* * * #
“Adamascus”: I agree with “Nitric” (B.
—O/9/ 24) that land balloting should be re-
stricted to qualified applicants. The competi-
tors . for the Ilosedale block, recently drawn
for in Queensland, numbered over 6500, 597
of them women. Almost every occupation
was represented; there were 350 clerks, 682
farmers, 1987 graziers, 140 publicans, 22.1
shearers, 54 public servants, 375 laborers,
132 railway employees, 124 drovers, 98 bank
clerks, 138 motor mechanics, 35 policemen,
50 postal officials, 193 commission agents, 103
carriers, 20 bookmakers and 18 jockeys. Ages
ranged from 18 to 81. Only about half
knew anything at all about the grazing
business. As the result of this ballot, Mini-
ster for Lands McCormack says the system
is to be reviewed and new legislation intro-
duced. As Queensland has about 4,000,000
acres of sheep land falling due in 1927, it
is just as well to prepare for the rush of
speculators and dummies.

“Cliloe”: After a four years’ slump the
pearling industry is looking up. The button
mills of Europe and America are again in
operation, and New York is a keen buyer of
nacre or shell. There is brisk competition
in Broome amongst the French and the
American buyers, and it is interesting to
hear some of the comments of these people,
fresh from Java, with its close and scientific
cultivation and its splendid cities, on Broome,
equally favored by Nature, but scarcely
marked on the map, and unknown except for
its pearling industry. It is a good port, with
a back country full of possibilities, and in
the main a good climate; yet during the past
20 years little, if any, real progress has been
made. “Gawd.” said an American visitor
to me after a day in Broome, “don’t tell me
after this that ole J. Bull can occupy the
tropics. Why, this spot ought to be a winter
resort for all Australasia, and what it’s like is
an Injun fishing-village where all the fish
have petered out. Say, you won’t keep it
long if your Government isn’t slicker.”
<, * * *
“P.P.” : Federal Public Service Commission-
ers have complained about the large pay-
ments for “the performance of higher duties’
when heads are absent. Some dav a suspi-
cion may strike them that the ease with
which the highly-paid heads can be absent
from duty indicates an overloading of the
departments. My own brief service experience
was in a department with half a dozen heads,
and often the absence of a couple did not
make any difference. But one day when I
(at about £7 per week) was absent a motor-
car and a typist were sent with an urgent
appeal to me to drag myself to the office if
possible; and, that failing, the same forces
supplemented by another officer (at £450
per annum), returned to repeat the entreaty
When I recovered I thought that if I was
so indispensable I should be paid for it;
but an application for a rise was endorsed
by the £450 officer “Not recommended ; but
iii view . of good work case might be re-
viewed in six months”; which was duly
endorsed by other officers on £5BO, £720 and
£9OO. Yet nobody would have thought it
necessary to send a motor-car delegation
after a single one of that expensive tribe.

“Midford”: Pity the Sydney City Council
couldn’t inculcate some ideas on personal
hygiene into our multitudinous Dago shop-
keepers. The most pretentious establish-
ments are in some respects as bad as the
dingiest. At three of the busiest hives on
Circular Quay the other evening I sought to
buy sixpenn’orth of acid drops. Each of
the obliging aliens to whom I indicated my
DOMESTIC CONFIBENCES.

body shot here last Saturday—is that

wants dragged down the glass jar with the
goods and cheerfully dug his fingers into
the sticky sweetmeats to separate them before
up-ending the bottle over the scale. The first
two merely looked aggrieved when I refused
to complete the contract: the third—my
temper was going by this time and possibly
I didn’t point out his shortcomings to him
as politely as I might have—cursed me in
the language of lovers, or it may have been
Greek or Syrian, for what he clearly re-
garded as unnecessary sqeamishness. In
any decently run shop, of course, some sort
of a fork would be kept for this work; these
Mediterraneans, who seem to have captured
the _ retail fruit trade of the city, if they
don’t know better ought to be taught better.

“Topee” : A couple of years hgo I came on
a Bulletin par., evidently written by an old
salt, telling of three steamship hands who
couldn’t raise one knife between them to
cut a gripe-lashing, and had to borrow the
mate’s pocket-knife, which snapped at first
attempt. The incident returned to my mind
on the well-deck of a large coaster in Dar-
ling Harbor last week. The old bos’n had
told one. of the hands to cut the stops on
some new gear just put on board. When
the man started to walk for’ard I heard the
following dialogue: “Where’re you off to?”
“To get a knife.” “What? You a sailor
and don’t carry a knife?” “Naow!” The
old ’un pulled out his own bleeder and
grunted: “But I’ll wager a month’s pay you
carry a founting-pen to figure out your over-
time !”
* * * *
“Emgee” (London) : The Aussie apple re-
ceived a good advertisement at Wembley
when 27 tons were sold on Whit Monday.
It got an extra advt., free of cost, when an
elderly couple appeared at the inquiry-office
and explained to the officer in charge that
while eating one of those Australian apples
the husband had lost his teeth. It appeared
that he was so obsessed by the lusciousness
of the fruit that lie was unconscious of his
loss for a few minutes, but on returning to
the spot where he tliour/ht the accident must
have occurred he could find no trace of his
missing property. Some hours later, how-
ever, the teeth were sent along to the inquiry-
office by some honest finder, and there they
lay on a shelf grinning at the passers-by until
they were claimed by their owner two days
later.
* * * *
“Feng-Sliui”: The Chinese post-office, of
which I wrote to The Bulletin a year ago,
remains a thing of magic and mystery. The
number of articles posted in the past year
was 473 millions, an increase of 47 millions
over the previous year. Honan, which has
been in a chronic fever of brigandage and
civil war for years, recorded an increase of
three millions. The bandits, while showing
no reluctance to waylay even foreigners, obey
the old unwritten law with regard to mails
which exists for the silk trade —it is allowed
to proceed without interference whatever the
political conditions. General trade indeed
shows much of the same tenacity. Canton,
which has been in a state of continuous
upheaval, showed an increase last year of
11 per cent. A little more civil war, with
assistance from a Bolshevik revolution and
an earthquake or two, should put the coun-
try completely on its feet.
* * * *
, “Gregory”: The acquisition of the exclu-
sive rights to sandalwood north of the 20th
parallel in Bananaland by a Fremantle
(W.A.) firm has stirred up the cutters and
traders at Thursday Island. China was
always ready to take all the wood offering,
and the output has been as high as 2500
tons per annum. To prevent this stripping
of the country the Government a while ago
set a limit of 600 tons p.a.; in this latest
contract the maximum allowed is 500 tons
and the minimum 200. Prices rose when
the 600 limit was imposed, and a cutter
could sometimes get £63 per ton in the 1922-
23 season; later £45 was a fair average. The
new shippers will pay only £4O per ton plus
a £4 royalty to the Government, which pre-
viously got £1; hence the discontent of tin
cutters. There are complaints, too, that
tenders -were not advertised locally. The
justification for the new arrangement ad-
vanced by E. 11. F. Swain (Director of
Forests) is that the minimum of £4O will
protect the cutters, who have sometimes been
compelled to accept as little as £l6 per ton ;
also it is pointed out that the annual ex-
ports in 1922-23 were on'g 994. nnd Pis tnn«
USEFUL EXERCISE.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
Whenever I’m “out” with the world—and that’s
often—
I polish my boots;
And during the task my mood seems to soften,
My bad humor scoots.
I start in a desperate way with the brushing,
Hard thoughts of the human race through my head
rushing ;
But soon for myself I can feel myself blushing—■
I polish my boots.
Take light exercise, friend, when your temper is
rising,
And polish your boots ;
It's a simple receipt, the result is surprising
For grumpy galoots.
Just tackle six pairs of large foot gear assorted ;
Your features reflected, with anger contorted,
Will shame you. Accept the rebuke you have courted
And polish your boots !

Sniping.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
CURIOUS how at times, when a man is
steadily working, some utterly ran-
dom thought will carry his mind in
a flash back years ago.
So it was with me this morning. I was
back in the galloping squadrons as we swung
under cover behind some low hilly rises dur-
ing the Gaza-Beersheba stunt. Our squad-
ron hastily dismounted at the extreme end
of one of those rises. A man immediately
collapsed to his knees with a bullet through
the lung. There was a rush to pull the pant-
ing horses as close under the sheltering rise
as possible. The dreaded thought “sniper”
flashed through every mind. The enemy
were lining the low hills in front of us, but
our man had been shot from away on the
right flank.
“Crack ! Thud !” A horse crashed on its
belly as a higli-veloeity bullet whistled into
its flank. “Crack! Thud!” A good-look-
ing chestnut reared surprisedly in the air,
pawed frantically in an attempt to regain
its balance, then crashed backward to earth,
the soft brown eyes growing pitifully big
as it struggled gamely to rise and couldn’t.
The trooper-owner stared down at it, in-
tense feeling spreading over his hard, drawn
face. A mate rushed out from cover and
jerked the man’s arm ; even as he did so a
vicious crackling whistle had come and gone
through the air. The emu feathers on the
trooper’s hat fell to his shoulder, sheared
clean off to the hat-rim.
The anxious squadron crouched close
against the rise, each man with his precious
horse pulled well in. The sniper evidently
could see partly around the extreme corner
of the rise, judging by the angle from which
the man and two horses had been shot.
I know of nothing that got more quickly
on the nerves of the troops than a sniper.
Under many conditions a thousand men
within the range of one solitary sniper could
not hit back. Each man simply had to
crouch low wherever he was, while the hidden
sniper systematically picked his helpless tar-
gets one by one. That sort of thing on the
nerves is. ghastly; compared with it heavy
sliell-fire is merely in the day’s routine.
So it was with us that morning. Our brigade
was in reserve. At any moment we might
be called upon to join in a galloping charge.
On the other hand we might have to remain
totally inactive for long hours, perhaps all
day—with, as far as our squadron was con-
cerned, that searching sniper banging at our
extreme right flank.
Very gingerly I looked from the side of the
rise through a pair of splendid field-glasses,
‘souvenired” from an Austrian officer of
artillery.
I possessed the reputation of being a sniper
myself. Now, every man knows that when
lie has built a repu>ation, or has had a repu-
tation thrust upci/: him, something forces him
to try to live flp to the wretched thing, no
matter what his heart may be whispering
within. So I nonchalantly examined the field
of barley on our right flank, whence, appa-
rently, the shots had come. But, inside, I
knew.
It was a beautiful, sun-kissed field. Emer-
ald-green. The crop just about a foot high.
As level as a billiard-table. High in the
clear air above the centre of the little field a
brown lark of Palestine trilled shrill and
exceeding sweet. But of life in the field
there was not one sign. I knew there would
not be. Over every yard of greenness, then
every foot, I searchingly played those high-
powered glasses. No slightest depression in
the ground, no almost invisible green mound
anywhere where green mound ought not to
be; absolutely nothing whatever behind, or
in, or between which a man could hide. But
I well knew that a trained man can lie per-
fectly still facing you riot a hundred yards
away on hard, brown earth without even a
grass-blade on it. and you can stare at the
muzzle of his rifle for ten minutes without
seeing him. Away back at Enoggera in peace-
ful Australia we had been taught this, months
before the Landing. And somewhere within
that field of a million barley-stalks a highly-
trained sniper lay easily concealed.
Between us and the edge of the barley-field,
just at the foot of the gentle slope which ran
down from our sheltering rise, and only a
hundred yards away, was a narrow wadi, or
gully in our own good language. Throwing
off haversack and water-bottle, I suddenly
jumped from behind the rise and tore down
the slope in a crouching run, jerking from
left to right, not for three seconds keeping
to one straight line. The crackling hisses
as the sniper tried rapid fire made a man
imagine the breath of white-hot iron.
I landed sprawling in the sheltering wadi-
bottom, and gasped in long, thankful breaths.
The first point in the game was won, any-
way. I filled my pipe, lit it, and commenced
slowly walking up the wadi. The banks
were about eight feet high, and I blew the
smoke upward so that its dying spirals just
cleared the bank and drifted into the air
above. When the bank became very high I
pocketed the pipe, and doubled quickly back
to where I had first sprawled into the wadi.
Pulling barley from the edge of the bank
was the next thing; then arranging the foot-
long stalks in a row around the hat-band,
and carefully spreading barley in flat sheaves
over my back under and over the bandolier
and bayonet-belt. Then the stealthy climb
up the wadi-bank and into the barley-field.
Only inch by inch, just inch by inch. " First
the length of the rifle (how heavy the fami-
liar weapon quickly became !) poked gently
on ahead, full-length of the arms, through
the barley stalks, then rested gently on the
earth, palms of the hands cupped protect-
ingly around the firing mechanism. Then
careful craning forward of the head, chin
pressed to the ground, then dragging of the
entire taut body along by leverage of the
elbows. Just one foot advance for each com-
plete drag, just one inch at a time, chin,
chest, belly and toes held tight against
the earth. The ribs held the thumping heart.
. A man’s mind could feci when any one
single barley-stalk among which he crawled
quivered the slightest little bit more than
it should. Then one long breath, and slowly,
very slowly, on again.
But what a . strain on the ears! For it
was the ears and not the eyes which might
mean the next point in the game. Somewhere
in that field lay the waiting sniper. Where
READY TO RECEIVE THEM.
“What’s that thing on your head, Auntie?”
“My mob-cap.”
“‘Mob,’ Auntie? Do you think they’ll be
game to come?”
I knew not. He would not move. But he
would fire.
My mates back on the rise would go
through all the old tricks to draw his fire.
A gently-moving hat held just above the sky-
line with a stick. A rifle poked above a
sand-mound with a hat slanting on the butt.
If this had no effect a man would dash from
cover, then back again, lively—anything so
that I might locate the sniper by the crack
of his rifle.
So on I crawled, and slowly on and on.
The further in the barley I was when his
rifle cracked the better chance of locating
him correctly. He wouldn’t move. From
his position the movement of his eyes alone
would naturally show him all up the gentle
slope of the rise and around the corner where
the squadron was crouching.
If he raised his head the least bit
too high above the barley to look for me he
would fall to my rifle, just as I would fall
to his should I raise my head.
He would simply wait, every instinct, every
nerve, every sense tuned to the uttermost with
the thrill of longing to put a bullet through
my brain. How I understood the feelings
of the hidden man, because they were my
own !
But his rifle did not crack, and I knew he
was too cunning a bird to fall to the tricks
of my mates. * He was waiting for me.
High in the cloudless sky the lark still car-
olled. From away on the right came a spas-
modic crackling, drowned by the fierce con-
centrated roar as a brigade burst into sudden
rifle-fire. Machine-guns butted in with a
harsh metallic chattering. A battery of
eighteen-pounders; then two more batteries
roared in with a thundering crescendo of
earth-shivering crashes.
“The En Zeds are into it again,” the mind
subconsciously told me. High in the air
came the drone of 'planes. “Our ’planes are
going to lay some eggs,” the mind said in
response to the familiar drone. Then came
splitting crashes away up in the heavens.
“Turkish anti-aircraft,” said the busy brain.
But I saw none of these things, and heard
them only as in some other, far-away world.
The whole battle to-day, the battle forever
for me or for him. lay waiting in this peace-
ful barley-field. Though one nation rose and
one fell by this evening, it would matter
not at all to one of us.
Without lifting chin from the ground, my
eyes would naturally rise slightly to the sky
on each pause for breath. Each time they
would alight on the carolling lark, as it
hovered so wonderfully balanced in the air,
only to rise almost out of sight in an appa-
rent attempt to sing its way to Heaven, to
reappear with miraculous rapidity, and hover,
shrilly singing—it seemed as I wormed fur-
ther and further into the field to hover con-
stantly over one particular spot!
I watched the lark for what seemed a long
time; then a breath-catching feeling gripped
my stomach and slowly ran up until it taut-
ened at the roots of the scalp. I felt my
mouth quickly open a little and eyes sud-
denly widen as I pressed back the rifle safety-
catch and gripped hard the splendid weapon.
Then twisting very slightly to the left, so as
to be in line with the hovering lark, I crawled
off again carefully, so very carefully no
mother ever nursed her first-born more gently
than I nursed my way through those tender
barley-stalks that were so easily bruised and
swayed—that swayed to a man’s hot breath.
Sound ! What a medley of sound there
was! Each stalk harbored life that continu-
ally hummed or hissed or chirped. And
things to see! There were countless live
green things in that barley, some of them
swarming over the stalks, so minute that I
never dreamt anything but a microscope
could have seen them. And as for the stalks
themselves they had all taken on individual
shape; some were tall, some were short, some
were bent, some were straight. But it was
very wonderful how far a still man. chin
pressed to the ground, could see through that
dim, green maze of stalks.
Actually some had wee tufts of grass
growing around their butts, and an odd wild
flower or two. One scarlet poppy of Pales-
tine pushed up its crimson cup in the fight
for sunlight and life among those million
struggling stalks. And over all the song
of the lark.
I raised straining eyes. In the air the
lark was hovering now, not so very high. At
any other time a man could hardly have
distinguished that little brown head point-
ing towards me, but held a little sideways,
looking straight down.
With open mouth, so that the outgoing
breath made no slightest whisper, I wormed
a little further on. Slow, tense minutes
passed in withdrawing the field-glasses and
carefully raising them but a few inches
above the ground.

WHEN the spark jumps across, what happens? Do you get instant response from the
motor spirit you are using? Does your engine accelerate smoothly and pick up
quickly ?
If your engine is in good mechanical condition the answer depends upon the
volatility of the motor spirit you use.
Plume, a highly volatile motor spirit, gives smooth acceleration, a quick pick up and
big power. It responds instantly to the spark, every drop is converted into gas for power.
There is no waste.
Use Plume and note how readily it responds. Note its all-round good performance.

HOME TRUTHS
For the Plain and the Pretty.
There are far more pretty women in the
world than women themselves realise.
Nearly every woman is potentially pretty:
in nine eases out of ten all that is needed is
a little care or some simple remedy to turn
a plain face into an attractive one.
THE SHORT SLEEVE QUESTION.
The new vogue of the ultra-short sleeve
is either charming or ridiculous, according
to the arms of the followers. Most of us
possess more or less shapely arms, but the
color and texture of the skin usually leaves
much to be desired. Red elbows, rough
hands, and discolored skin are not lightly
exposed by a wise woman. Of course, you
have only to think a minute before hitting
on a remedy. There must he few women to-
day who do not know the blessing of mer-
eolized wax for a bad complexion. Obviously
the only thing to do is to treat the skin of
the arms in exactly the same way as that of
the face. Before going to bed, wash the
arms thoroughly in hot water. When they
are dry smear them all over with mercolized
wax, sponging it off in the morning. After
a few days the rough discolored skin will
have been absorbed, leaving the smooth new
skin exposed. This treatment should be
used fairly frequently, as the skin of the
arms soon becomes red and coarse when
exposed.
FREE SHAVES!
Did you see in the paper the other day
that a lady won “three months’ free shaves”
in a tombola? Some of us might not have
laughed so much had we drawn her ticket!
How often one sees a girl, otherwise pretty,
ruined by a growth of superfluous hair on
her face. It is a fact that some women do
shave; but it is very foolish to do so, for it
only stiffens and encourages the growth of
the unwanted hair.
The subject of short sleeves has been
mentioned, and a word must be said about
the sleeveless frocks which our dressmakers
provide for the evenings.
It cannot be said too often that the only
safe and reliable way of getting rid of
superfluous hair is to do it at home with a
little powdered pheminol. The whole pro-
cess will only take about ten minutes, and
the result is really astonishing.
THE LITTLE MORE!
“The little more....and how much it
is!” might be exclaimed with some point
on the question of eyelashes. A quarter of
an inch more, and a pair of ordinary eyes
are transformed into “fringed magical pools.”
Very few people seem to realise that the
lashes can be lengthened and gradually
darkened by the occasional application of a
little mennaline to their roots. No, it isn't
a dye, and it’s absolutely harmless! Get
an original package from your chemist.
DOES WAITED HAIR SUIT YOU?
Wavy hair is more becoming to the
majority of faces than straight locks.
Unhappily, most of us are not blessed with
naturally curly hair, and the “icily regular"
waves of the hairdresser are a very poor
imitation of the fascinating natural “kink.”
Incidentally the use of hot tongs is murder
and suicide to the color, silkiness and
strength of the hair. Have you any sil-
merine? If not, you can get some from
your chemist. The proper way to use it
is to comb the hair in the way you usually
do when you are going to put it up. When
you have decided where you want your
waves, damp just those parts of the hair
with silmerine, and put a small slide in each
place where you want a wave to appear.
Be careful not to use too much silmerine,
and only damp the places where you want a
wave. Gather as much hair as possible into
the slides, so as to make the wave more
definite. Having placed your slides, fluff up
the hair between them with a comb. If
your hair is very lank and straight you may
have to persevere for some time in this
treatment. It requires patience and coax-
ing, but the results are delightful, for the
| waves produced by silmerine tend to last
longer and longer until they become really
natural to the hair.
SOME VICTORIAN HEROINES.
The very plainest face is redeemed by a
graceful and cleverly dressed figure. You
will doubtless remember that Wilkie Collins’s
most famous heroines were not remarkable
for handsome faces, but for perfect propor-
tions of body. Fatness, besides being
slightly ridiculous and really dangerous, is
a great foe to beauty, but it is unwise to try
to reduce it by violent methods. Try taking
a few elynol berries after each meal. They
are perfectly harmless, and they really do
have a wonderful power of reducing super-
fluous flesh.

How the barley stalks leaped into promin-
ence ! How much further a man could see!
The distance but a few yards ahead had
before merged into vague greenness; now,
far beyond that, one could make out spaces
between the barley-stalks, and where they
entered the red earth the minute pellets of
sand around the earth-worms’ holes looked
like big brown clods.
Then something moved. It was only the
turn of his cheekbone, but it allowed me
to focus right into the eyes of my man.
Great, blazing black eyes that had gazed
into the haze of the desert horizon for the
silhouette of the camel caravans many and
many a time. Only partly could I see the
big brown nose, liawk-shaped, for two twisted
barley-stalks grew right before it. The regu-
lar hot breath from his long, thin brown lips
swayed them to an almost imperceptible
rhythm. His jet-black beard was pressed
to the ground among the stalks, and threaded
barley-stalks camouflaged his black bour-
dons. The perfectly-shaped tiny black dot
of his rifle muzzle I could see, and below the
telescopic sight the bony brown finger-
knuckles that gripped around the weapon.
A Bedouin of the desert, with the piercing
eyes of a hawk.
As carefully as myself he brought some-
thing towards his face. Tilting forward
the barley-covered hat, I lay for long minutes,
eyelids pressed to the rough earth.
“Field-glasses—best German make for
sure,” flashed through the racing brain as I
lay there utterly motionless and—waited.
At last I brought the glasses up again.
His eyes now were continually moving in a
motionless face, from left to right, from
left to right, and I could almost hear him
listening.
Very patiently I marked between all the
many barley-stalks those two stalks which
still crossed his nose. With craning neck
I aligned them perfectly, put the field-
classes down gently, and never for the
faintest breath of time let my eyes miss his
eyes.
Then the calculation on which one life
would depend. Dearly I would have loved
to level the rifle foresight fair between those
two black eyes—the desire was almost over-
whelming. But many barley-stalks besides
the two crossed ones were in the way. Such
a tiny thing might deflect a bullet when a
man had only one shot.
I could see the butt of the two stalks
as they crossed down his nose in a straight
line past the centre of his chin where the
black beard hid them.
Aim right at the butt of the stalks
exactly where the beard covered them. The
bullet then should strike that little hollow
below the throat at the base of the neck
between the two bones, and go right down
through his body. He should never move.
Settled.
Then the indrawing of a deep breath, the
raising of the rifle, the easing of the racing
nerves as the familiar weapon settled its
iron-shod butt reassuringly into the hollow
of my shoulder, the absolute steadiness as
the trigger finger took the “first pull” and
the foresight lowered on the barley stalk
down past the eyes, past the mouth, past
the chin, and, engaging in the rear sight,
stopped dead where the beard hid the butt
of the barley stalk.
“I shall cut the stalk dead in two,” I
thought in that last fraction of a second of
complete steadiness.
“Crack!”
I bounded out of the barley and was on
the spot even as lie rolled over. He was
dying.. His flashing black eyes fastened on
mine in a gaze of instant realisation and
undying hate. He attempted to raise his
arm, and the sinews tautened in the thick
brown wrist as he tried vainly to clench his
list. I knew—he was beseeching all the
curses of the Prophet upon this Christian
dog who had taken his life. But as his
wordless lips bared back in the last of the
choking gasps of death I only thought: “I
wish I had your splendid teeth. Blackbeard.
They are no use to you now!”
Looking down at him, like a great fallen
brown hawk in the crushed barley. I felt no
remorse; only hot pride that in fair warfare
I had taken the life of a strong man—Lot
pride that this man, older and far stronger
physically than I. brought up from baby-
hood to regard warfare as the life of a man
and splendid sport, and knowing every inch
of the country, had fallen to a stranger from
a peaceful land who knew only three years
of war!
Quickly I looked him over for the inevit-
able souvenirs. Strung on a camel sinew
around his neck were 38 identification discs,
mostly those of British troops, but with
a sprinkling of Australian and one Maori-
Jand badge. A Mahommedan goes to Paradise
if he can kill a Christian. So this good
religionist had 38 keys to the pearly gates,
llicre was a special silver medal also, and
a parchment deed of recognition from the
Sultan.
Presently I turned and examined the barley
r r°r\i C ose nt was uot un til a couple

over that we found what we sought. Within
a toot of the Bedouin’s body, cunningly
interwoven between four stalks of barlev

The Haj and the Oof.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
IF 1 two million hayseeds who had never
heard of the three-card trick or the
pea and the thimble, and who wouldn't
know an uncle from Fiji if they saw one,
descended on Sydney annually, the secre-
taryship of the Spielers’ Union would be
a job worth faking ballots for; and this is,
in a manner of speaking, the prize for which
tlic- various parties in the Ilejaz are at
present contending. Husein Ibn Ali, the
chief pickpocket whom the British Govern-
ment put in charge of the business after the
war, is a vain and pompous person whom
much subsidy hath driven mad. His pos-
session of Mecca, where the pilgrims go,
made him the envy of all the neighboring
bandits, and when he proclaimed himself
Caliph in succession to the Sultan, lately
pushed out of Stamboul by the Very Young
Turks, all Islam stood on end.
Islam is not the happy family Lothrop
Stoddard and other literary bogey men
would make us believe. Even in Malaya
there are many sects, including the Hanifi,
Sliafiee, Maliki and Ilambali. The Shafiee
when praying press their hands on their
hearts to signify that they subdue the
thoughts of this world; the Hanifi hold their
hands across their stomachs to indicate the
same thing; the Maliki fold their hands
across their breasts. I don’t know what
the Ilambali do, but it is probably some-
thing different from all the others. Mahomet
ordered all the sects to raise their hands
above their heads because idolaters were in
the habit of hiding idols beneath their arm-
pits. Each sect declares Mahomet adopted
only its one particular style, and there is a
lot of ill-feeling about it.
My authority for all this is my friend
Haji Mohammed Sa’aid, of Penang. As his
first name indicates, he has been to Mecca,
the pusat bumi or navel of the world; so he
knows all about it. Burckhardt, Burton,
the Blunts and Baron Noldc have also been
there, I think, but I know only Burton’s
account, which is interesting reading, but
tinged_ with European scepticism. " Moh.
Sa’aid's story makes the truer picture. When
he went to Mecca with his wife to see if the
Prophet could do anything to cure her of the
modern prejudice among Malay women
against bearing more than ten children, there
was no railway, and they had to walk from
Jeddah to Medina and the Holy City. They
were duly robbed of what money the German
steamship co. had left them, stripped stark
naked and sent back to the protection of the
nearest Governor, who was, of course, in the
robbers’ pay. Some of their goods having
gone on by caravan, they were allowed to pro-
ceed to Mecca, where they performed all the
observances required for the completion of
the haj. Eor the due number of days they
prayed in the Bait A 1 Ilaram, through whose
roof the devout of heart, by looking up, can
see the wonders of Heaven ; but the priests
have lately hung a cloth below the ceiling,
because many who looked were struck dumb
or driven mad by what they saw. They
walked seven times around the Ivaaba and
ran seven times between the mountains Safa
and Merwa. They licked the rock called
Sheep’s Heart, which gives clearness of sight
and is so filthy that even the dogs will not
touch it. They passed successfully between
the two pillars that are only a finger’s breadth
apart, and between which the true believer
can walk but the infidel sticks, and they
threw seven stones at the Devil. After this
they proceeded to Medina, where are the
tombs of Mahomet, Adam and Ilawa (Eve),
One hundred orang pUntong watch over the
Prophet’s sepulchre. They are called pun-
tong because they are free from wordly pas-
sions. The pilgrims placed a kettle full of
water and an empty spittoon in the tomb;
in the morning the kettle was empty and the
spittoon was full; for this miracle the orang
puntong collected what was left of the tra-
vellers’ wealth in kind.
The story of the tomb being suspended in
mid-air, however, is a garbled version. The
fact is, Moh. Sa’aid says, there is a rock
ouside Mecca which floats about 2ft. from
the ground. Mahomet in an ascent to
Heaven took off from this rock, which fol-
lowed him upwards to the extent of a yard.
Since then it has gradually sunk closer to the
earth. When it makes contact the world
will come to an end. The mosque authorities
some time ago placed two stakes under it
because the sight of so heavy an object sus-
pended from nothing shocked the nerves of
pregnant women and caused miscarriages.
Even a special offering to Fatimah, the
Prophet’s favorite spouse had failed to effect
the determination of his wife not to have
any more children ; so he took a new wife
aged 14, but that is another story.
I witnessed the start of a pilgrimage
from Batavia, in Java, the other day. Each
pilgrim was equipped with a thousand
guilders (£80) or so, which is an astounding
fortune in a country where children work
in the tea factories for 3d. a day, plus id.
for five hours’ overtime. The big steamer
was cleared as if for the reception of cattle,
and 400 devotees were packed in her; then
she went off to other ports, to pick up more
pilgrims. Last year 4700 went from Band-
jermassin, 800 from Lombok and 30,000 from
Java, altogether taking about a million
guilders out of the colony. I have many
times seen them come back, and so holy
have they become that their sacred feet are
not allowed to touch the ground until their
admirers have carried them several yards
up the strand. A new house has to be built
for their reception, and they are too holy to
be permitted to go in unto their wives until
40 days have elapsed.
The trouble about the haj, from the Euro-
pean imperialist’s point of view, is that it
takes a lot of money out of needy native vil-
lages and returns in exchange a swollen-
headed spiritual potentate, with aggressive
ideas about the future of Islam, mixed up
with undigested odds and ends of communis-
tic doctrine which have filtered down from
Moscow, via Batoum and Angora. The re-
sult is very clearly seen in Java and its more
or less revolutionary societies. The Tan-
gerang affair, which frightened the Dutch
early this year, had this genesis. Forty-two
Malays, consecrated to death but wearing
talismans that conferred invulnerability,
started a march to Buitenzorg to induce the
Dutch Government to place their leader,
Kaiah, a tall fanatic, on the throne of the
ancient Javanese sultans. The police met
them, and to avoid bloodshed decided to walk
the frenzy out of them. After a few miles
the band were tired and ready to lay down
their arms; but a woman bade them do or
die. They charged the police with primi-
tive weapons. One officer killed seventeen,
including the leader, with his Mauser pistol.
It was over in two minutes. One white and
one native policeman were killed, and of the
fanatics twenty-seven were killed and the
rest disabled.
The pious pickpockets who control things
at Mecca, however, do not concern them-
selves with these things. Their main con-
sideration is who is to share the loot.

WAX Your Linoleum
Your linoleum will last longer—look better and clean easier if polished occasionally
with Johnson’s Paste or Liquid Wax. It prevents cracking and blistering—brings
out the pattern and colour —protects linoleum from wear —and makes cleaning easy.
Wax is the ideal finish and polish for all of your floors. It will make them beau-
tiful —easy to care for —they won’t be slippery—and will not heel-print.
Johnson's Polishing Wax
WAX is, by far, the most economical
finish and polish for floors and linoleum.
With waxed floors expensive refinish-
ing is never necessary, for walked-on
places can be easily and quickly rewaxed
as worn spots appear without going
over the entire floor.
J ohnson’s Polishing Wax is conveniently
put up in three forms. Use the Paste Wax
for all floors —wood, linoleum, tile, etc.
We recommend the Liquid Wax for
polishing furniture, phonographs, wood-
work, linoleum, leather and motor cars.
Johnson’s Powdered Wax will immedi-
ately put any floor in perfect
condition for dancing.
The easy way to wax floors and
linoleums is to use a Johnson
Weighted Polishing Brush.
It spreads the Wax evenly—
polishes the Floor easily—
and is an ideal floor duster.
Ď
You can give every room in your home
that delightful air of immaculate clean-
liness by using Johnson’s Polishing Wax
occasionally on your furniture, wood-
work, floors and linoleum. It imparts a
beautiful, hard, dry, glass-like polish
which will not show heel and finger prints
or collect dust and lint. Johnson’s Wax
cleans, polishes, preserves and protects
—all in one operation. It is easy to apply
and polish.
ThrougKall their centuries the beautiful
interiors of famous European castles and
palaces have known no finish but wax.
Perfectly preserved —the
waxed wood mellows and
glows with the years.
This same beautiful finish
can be easily duplicated on the
floors, woodwork and furniture
of any Australasian home with
Johnson’s Polishing Wax.

Out on Her Own.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
RAIN and the green hills from the
Border north to Gympie and be-
yond ; jungle and sugar-cane; by St.
Lawrence a long grassy plain with a black
tide in it like the salt meadows about Long
Island Sound; further north a sodden world.
The flood of the Burdekin lapping the rails:
100 feet of brown water that by night ap-
pears only a few inches deep; and at the
northern shore a saturated man bearing a
lantern and crying to the midnight train
“Paper!”
Five hundred and forty miles north-west
of Townsville, between the Burke and the
Wills rivers, is Duchess, which I first saw
as a run of malachite and calcite flush with
the alluvial surface nearly 20 years ago.
The Duchess grossed a millioQ and is
finished.
Horses suffering the curse of the good
season—the fly plague, that makes their
eyes running sores. In this divine air once
the flies are gone breathing has the plea-
sure of wine, and always the nights are
paradise. In the long plains of Mitchell
and Flinders grass and the rolling lime-
stone country almost all the cattle are
young, drought having kindly wiped out aged
beasts that could not find a market. And
so to Bushy Park and the Potholes; and
in 64 miles from Duchess, Mt. Isa. The
highest hill of the lode-channel of five miles
long and a mile wide has for backbone a
black outcrop of manganiferous iron, and
this spine is named Out on Her Own.
There is in this field, unknown till a
year ago, although within half a mile of the
road on the eastern bank of the Leichhardt
that has borne men to Commoweal and the
Territory for the last 60 years, something
of a parallel with the country that holds
it—Australia. Of the oldest geologically, it
was hidden safe for a few thousand years
while India sweated and Babylon fell to a
dustheap and Egyptian civilisation became
Greek and then Roman, and moved north
to the savage of Germany and the painted
kernes of Britain. For so long hidden from
the errors of Europe, it was at last settled
by the nation that had as many capital
offences on its statute-book as there are
days in the year. And then Australia found
itself and made itself with gold that brought
the best of the world, liot-foot to adventure
and romance. From these adventurers we
have derived a greater independence of
thought than any other nation, and our
clean land, that did not have a pest until
dullards brought them, has given the best
Australians the physique of athletes. For
such a people such a country can make a
golden age; for Australia has genius. But
there can be no genius without works.
Genius without industry is a dumb oracle;
the indolent genius can be outstripped by
near-mediocrity that has the divine faculty
of work.
In the failing afternoon I sat on the back-
bone of the Out on Her Own. its blackness
on the eastern ridge blacker in sunset. Be-
hind me a sky of flame and before me a
firmament of turquoise; the eastern plain
in shadow, and, beyond, the river gums graci-
ously green; the flies hidden in the spinifex
or descended to a lower level; the masses
of iron and manganese and adamantine jas-
peroid already darkening to night; a tent
far below glimmering—the little calico
house of hope sheltering a prospector with
the courage of Alvaro, beginning a labor
APROPOS.
THE NUT: “By Jove, you look ripping to-day! I could eat you."
THE WAITER : “ Would you like anything else, sir?"
as ambitious as that of a beetle trying to
pierce a cannonball. And beyond, north
and south, concentric hills and serried ranges
putting on their covers for the night; and,
west, concentric hills and serried ranges
glowing in their bath of flame.
A hundred men who were a few months
ago without hope beyond the next meal have
now the chancre of the prizes of mining, or,
at least, a front seat in the game of it;
and except to the huckster and the grubber
the game is always greater than the stake.
For 60 years of white man’s occupation this
field has waited for to-day—mostly because
its surface is black, and most men who saw
it before its effective discovery were copper-
prospectors looking for rocks efflorescing
perialistic Freetraders who beg ns to con-
tinue importing commodities rather than
manufacture them, and relying on the Bri-
tish Navy rather than on ourselves, are our
wor ,t ■ enemy. For the British Navy hur-
riedly called upon at this distance may
prove to be not much more than a tradi-
tion of Trafalgar.
It is hard to believe that Britain, which
has learned so little by war that it still
makes a fetich of Freetrade and closes its
own factories so that Germany shall again
save the money to fight us with, can belong
to the year 1924. In the most recent war
the German started off with the wrong foot;
he is now engaged in an easier conquest of
Britain, and his ally is the British Custom
copper salts and outcrops that look like
maps of Ireland.
This field looks as if many men will take
fortunes out of it. What is Australia her-
self to get out of it—except records and
statistics? To the north is the gulf of Car-
pentaria, and beyond the Gulf the only
enemy. To it we may send the lead that
shall be mined here, receiving again the metal
manufactured into pipes and sheets—and
bullets, as many a German shot Australians
with small pieces of exported Broken Hill.
Neither this nor any other gift of Australia
can be good for us i'f it confirms us in our
casual habit of trusting to luck. The Im-
Houses that do not function. The ambition
to keep white a continent —the first of the
kind since white man’s greed told him to
carry the blessings of commerce and the
gospel to the simple nigger—calls not for
the Australian’s casualness, but for an
egotism almost English. It is impossible to
maintain White Australia unless Austra-
lians are one-eyed for their country. With
prohibitive Protection we can increase our
population and keep the possible enemy
poorer than if xve buy goods from him so
that he may fight us with his traders’ profits.
High Protection, with even a sumptuary
law against the importation of dispensable
luxuries as if we were in war-time—which,
indeed, we are, because war menaces until
we are strong enough to make the menace
empty. We cannot grow wheat to compete
in Europe with America or Russia —then
why grow wheat for export? The world must
have Australian wool; then make the world
pay for it here, and so give Australian wool-
growers the extra two million pounds now
taken in exchanges. Almost all our wool is
exported unscoured; answer that with an
export duty on greasy. Prohibit the export
of stud sheep; else we may one day find
much of the foreign trade departed—just as
we now import Australian wattle-bark grown
in South Africa, and just as we may soon
4mport Australian eucalyptus-oil grown in
South Africa and California. Cut out all
preference to any other country, including
Britain, which loves us so much that our
export meat-trade is ruined for the sake of
the vested interests in Britain of Argentine
meat. It would buy wool elsewhere, too, if
it could.
The other day I tried to cross the Cooper,
in the far west of Warrego. Some diffident
person named the Cooper a “creek” —after
it has received two rivers, the Thompson and
the Barcoo. When I was last there the
conditions were of drought, and Cooper’s
Creek was only 17 miles wide. In very
wet seasons its span can be 40 to 50 miles.
A dam at Oontoo would back it up a hundred
or more over a soil that will grow anything,
given water. The hundred millions neces-
sary to lock the Riverina system would be
the money of Prudence, and gotten as easily
as the 400 millions Australia found for war
—more easily, indeed, if we warned off most
of the foreign imports that now thank God
for a country of wealthy fools.
And these things done, then work and
more work; better service than any other
people can give, and better citizenship than
any other country knows. Warn off the
loafer immigrant and the unemployable im-
migrant and the immigrant who preaches
loafing on the job (more fatal to the fibre
of the man than to the job itself), and the
loyal importer who talks of Freetrade and
the Dear Old Empire in the one breath, and
says “God Save the King” when he means
“Low duties on the foreign manufactures of
cheap labor.”

Night burgeons and the north blackens!
May it not blacken with enemy smoke be-
fore we are prepared. But Australia the
Ready can maintain the name of her excel-
lence—“ Out on Her Own.”

at the Opera !"
IF you live in the city, perhaps once or twice in a season you
may have the opportunity of seeing grand opera, of listening
to a few world-famous artists; if you live in the country per-
haps such an opportunity may never come to you.
Yet any evening, in the comfort of your own home, if you own
a Rexonola you can conjure up at will the music of your
favourite opera —the songs or instrumental music you love best —■
not once only, but as often as you wish ; not only the living but
those who, like Caruso, have passed, yet live again in the records
they have handed down to us.
This priceless heritage of music would be of little use were it
not for an instrument like the Rexonola, which will interpret it
faithfully—play for you as the artist intended.

The Importance of Coned: "Tone Focus”
Just as, in a camera, the light rays must be correctly focussed, so, in a talking
machine, correct “ tone focus” is of the utmost importance. The special
construction of the Rexenola Patented Reflector Sound Chamber has solved
this difficult problem ; every Rexonola is built on these correct principles,
making the tone full and rich, and entirely free from distortion. Listen to a
Rexonola playing, close your eyes, and you will find it difficult to realise that
the living artist is not in the room.
REXONOLAS for Tone
Every Rexonola is constructed to play all makes of disc records ; whatever your
musical tastes, there is an almost inexhaustible repertoire from which to
choose. There is a Rexonola for eve r y home from the simple and sturdy
Rexonola Number 17 to the richly carved and beautifully finished Console
models —the Jacobean and the Louis.

The Ballad of a Grey Thought.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
AS I went down to Mary Town
I saw an old grey man;
His hands were wrinkled, thin and
brown,
But his bi’oken slippers ran
With a wheezy creak from tree to tree,
From oak to elm and ash to beech;
And he bowed to them with a crooked knee
And spoke a word to each.
“Old man,” I said, “the ground is sweet,
The cloves of lilac fall;
There is barley bread and honey to eat
And milk enough for all.
But why would you wear your slippers out,
With the leather creaking dry,
When the day is done beyond a doubt,
With a slip of moon in the sky?”
He said : “I served a bearded king
For three score years and ten ;
And I have walked in evei’y Spring
With high, tall men.
But never I met with men like these
Below the sun and moon ;
There is great heart in the green trees
And a song late and soon.
“There is Moses here and Joseph there
And Justin in between,
Since the great priest that walks on air
Baptised them good and green ;
There is crooked Peter and straight Paul,
And Matthew old and brown ;
And I must come to their low call
At the gate of Mary Town.”
His hands were wrinkled, brown and thin,
His slippers old and red :
And he looked like a man who would take in
Strange thoughts to his head.
“There is gentle Alice,” I heard him say
To the willow-tree below,
“If she would call from far away
What could I do but go?
“ ’Tis long since she and I were wed
And we have children five:
The Thought of Milk and the Thought of Silk
And the Thought of Bees in a Ilive,
And the cosy Thought of a Warm Turf Fire
And the Thought of a Soft Green Road—
They all are children of desire
That i*eap where they have sowed.
“The bearded king is a heavy man
And sleeps on a black wood bed;
And what he can by any plan
With small words may be said.
But the high trees have a song to ci-oon
That makes a magic fair;
And they walk every night with the moon
On a l’oad of fine air.
“So surely I would serve the trees
That are my good wife’s kin,
And speak them true of the young breeze
That fell to deadly sin,
To the prayerless sin that has no name
On the mouth of any man,
But takes a widow’s curse and blame
Under an orphan’s ban.
“The breeze came down from the mountains
seven
And blew on a lone shore,
Till every angel in God’s Heaven
Shut it out of the door;
And I would run in my red shoes
With the sure word in my mouth
To carry the trees the great news
That the north said to the south.”
I knew not what his words might mean ;
But were he mad or sane.
There was one breeze that blew between
The corners of the plain.
It came in at a small door
And went as a thin ghost;
And we that wept had speech no more
With her we loved the most.
A great sin was on that air,
A sin of murder done
By a thin breeze that was past the prayer
Of all below the sun....
I went my way to Mary Town ;
And the belfry tower stood stark,
Mourning up and mourning down
For the sorrow that goes in the dark.
N.s.w.

Twin-bed Dialogues.
BABETTE AND THE BURGLAR.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
f I THROUGH my dreams I grew conscious
of a voice whispering, “Wake up,
dear! Wake up!”
“Wassmatter?” I drowsily muttered, as I
felt the softness of Babette against me,
warm and cosy. What had brought Babette
into my twin-bed in the middle of the night?
Frightened, pei’haps? I woke up.
“It’s all right, darling,” her voice whis-
pered, “a burglar!”
I confess that I did not leap valiantly
from the bed, and in the heroic defence of
my wife and family confront his revolver.
When you’re only half-awake in the middle
of the night, you don’t feel as courageous as
you ought to be. Two-o’clock-in-the-morning
bravery is not in the line of a humdrum
and placid householder. Still, with Babette
clutching me in her nervousness I had to
do something desperate. I hated leaving
the warm sheets and safety for a midnight
struggle with an armed desperado; but I sat
up and sti-ove to pierce the darkness of the
bedi’oom. Not a sound! Was he waiting to
spring upon me? When would that revolver
go off?
Babette clung to me. Women always do
that sort of thing when a man is all strung
up to do battle for his home. Flow can a
man prove himself a man, no matter how
much he dislikes doing it, when a delectable
female is clinging to his pyjamas? I shook
her off, and
“It’s all right, dear,” cried Babette. “He’s
gone, cleared out!”
“No,” I muttered, my coui’age rising; “lie’s
hiding in the room. I’ll show him!”
Babette’s clutch tightened. “I saw him
leave five minutes ago. Really truly! But
I had a terrible time!”
“You’re sure he’s gone?” I asked the
frightened thing that clung to me for her
protection. She moaned her belief. Never
had I felt the instinct of protection so strong.
What would I not do to shield this feeble
feminine thing from harm? To think that I
had calmly slept through the awful experi-
ence Babette must have had, while I should
have been pei’forminsr pi*odigies of valox*,
with Babette, the sheets over her head,
waiting for the blow that would have felled
the brutal intruder! And I had missed pro-
bably the only chance that would come to me
to show myself, in Babette’s adoring eyes, a
Man !
“But you haven’t told me about it?” I
anxiously asked. “Why didn’t you wake
me when you heard the noise?”
“I didn’t hear a noise,” Babette replied.
“I woke up suddenly in the dark. Some-
thing had flashed on my face. I suppose it
was an electric torch. And then I heard
something moving in the room. I wanted
to call out to you in’your bed, dearest, but
I didn’t dax - e.”
“But why didn’t you?” I indignantly
asked.
“Yes,” said Babette, “and if I had, you
would have waked up and sprung at him,
and he would have murdered you. I know
how fearless you are, dear; but I would
rather have you in bed with me now than be
the widow of a hero. Though I know that
you can fight—though I’ve never seen you
light—l told myself that against that ruf-
fian, with his revolver, you wouldn’t have
a chance.”
“Perhaps not,” I grudgingly admitted;
“but all the same”
“I thought of that in a flash,” Babette
continued; “and I never made a move.
Scared? Of course I was. Too scared to
do anything. But 1 knew enough not to
PUT AND TAKE.
BILL : “Mean to tell me yer believe in equality for ther sexes?”
LIL: “I do.”
BILL: “Then, buy yer own blanky ticket.”
scream. Oolx!” she whispered, with a
shudder, “what was that?”
I confess that I felt creepy in that silence.
It was nice to feel Babette’s arms round
me. But there was no sound. It wasn’t
worth while to get up and investigate, or to
turn on the light. Never turn on the light
with a burglar. You know the nasty corners
where you might bark your shins, and the
burglar doesn’t.
“Nonsense!” I bravely reassured Babette.
“There’s nobody there. You’re so nervous
that you’re imagining things. Women always
do.”
“Yes, dear,” she penitently said. “I’ll try
to be brave, like you.”
“But tell me,” I urged, turning on the
light, and finding, as I expected, nobody else
in the room, “what happened.”
“Well,” said Babette, snuggling closer, “I
saw a dark figure, with his back to me,
bending over the dressing-table. There was
a little light playing over the things on the
table. He had an electric torch, of course.”
“So you let him pick and choose, Babette,”
I sighed; “and now I suppose all your
jewellery’s gone. Oh, why didn’t you wake
me in time?”
“I thought it better not, dear. What are
a few bits of jewellery compared with your
life? I didn’t dare look at him too much,
in case he turned round and flashed his torch
on me; but I made out that he had some-
thing black over his head. Once he looked
quickly round, and flashed his light on me,
but I was sound asleep. When I ventured
to peep again, he had gone into your dressing
room.”
“My wallet!” I cried. “With ten —no,
twelve pounds in it! Oh, well, we ought to
be thankful that it wasn’t worse.”
“Yes, indeed!” said Babette. “But I
haven’t told you the worst. I knew that it
wasn’t any use trying to wake you up before
the burglar came back —you know how hard
it is for me to get you up in time for break-
fast. You’d be so dazed that you wouldn’t
have had a chance with that magnificently-
built burglar. There was only one thing
for me to do. So I waited, frightened to
death, and back he came into our room,
slipping something into his pocket.”
“My money!” I said.
“Of course, dear. I’ve always told you not
to leave your money about just where a bur-
glar would look for it. Well, there he was,
and when he flashed his light on me, there
I was, frozen in terror, sitting wide-awake
up in bed! I never saw a man more sur-
prised in my life —and I have found that it
is pretty hard to surprise a man nowadays.”
“But, dearest, you didn’t do anything
rash?” I anxiously asked.
“Oh no, dear,” Babette reassured me.
“When he stopped like a cat he was quite
taken by surprise. Admiration, too, I’m
sure! There was a look in that burglar’s
eye that plainly said, ‘Snice!’ I’ve seen the
same look in other men’s eyes, though never
when I was sitting up in bed in my airiest
nightie. Still, a burglar is much the same
as other men, don’t you think? He’s just
as good a judge of a woman as any other
male. Well, I did not raise my voice—l
didn’t want to wake you. I just said in what
they call a tense whisper: ‘lf you come an
inch further I’ll scream and wake up my
husband, who’s got a revolver under his pil-
low and is horribly careless in the way he
handles it. And he’s got a dirty left that
is even rpore deadly. And if I scream I’ll
wake up the children, and their yells will
l’ouse the whole neighborhood, and your
chance of slipping away with my jewellery,
a wedding present from my husband, will
be a very slim one; and I’ll not get the
children to sleep again, and you’ll never hear
the end of that!’ I know that isn’t the sort
of speech that the heroine says on the stage,
but he understood it all right.
“All the time I could see that he was
thinking whether lie could risk leaping upon
me and gagging me before I could scream.
Of course, I hadn’t the remotest intention of
screaming. You would spring from your
bed; thei’e would be a terrific struggle, and
you’d get your name into the papers, but
I would be a widow. So we looked at each
other warily, and he didn’t move. No, dear,
he wasn’t fascinated by my beauty, though
I know he admired me.”
“How did you know that,” I asked, “when
you couldn’t see his eyes?”
“A woman’s instinct, my deai%” smiled
Babette. “But I could see a flash in his
eyes behind his black mask. I don’t know
how long we stared at each other—it seemed
ages. Then I said I wasn’t going to scream
if he would only go away quietly, and leave
the things he had taken. And if he pro-
mised I’d promise not to move or make a
sound for at least ten minutes.
“Then in quite a thrilling voice he said,
‘Yes, my lady; and the minute I’m out of
the room you’ll wake up that husband of
yours and rush to the telephone.’
“All I could see of him was the lower
part of his face, though there was an excit-
ing glint in his eyes. But I rather liked
his chin —such a dominant chin! I wish
you had one, dearest. I could see he was
in trouble, but he soon made up his mind.
“‘Sorry to disturb you, lady,’ he said;
‘but you’ve got to come along with me.’
“I smiled at him, and asked him if he
wanted to elope with me; but I don’t think
burglars have a real sense of humor. He
said he wasn’t going to leave me in the room
to wake up everybody; and told me to hurry
up. Fortunately I wasn’t in one of my
nicest nighties; so I slipped out of bed,
grabbed my dressing-gown and got into it,
put on my boudoir-cap—the pink one—-and
felt for my slippers.”
“I see,” I said to Babette, “you were play-
ing for time, in the hope that I would wake
up. That was very clever of you, dear.”
“Oh no,” said Babette. “I certainly didn’t
want you to wake, with that man standing
over you with a revolvei*. But I wasn't
going to be seen unattractively dressed and
without my hair in order by any male per-
son, even though he was a burglar. So we
went downstairs. ‘Ladies fh'st,’ lie politely
ordered; but I knew the reason for his good
manners. He didn’t trust me.
“And just as we got into the hall there
was a loud kuock on the front door, and the
doorbell rang! Before the burglar could
stop me—l was in fx-ont of him, you know —
I got to the door and opened it. And there
was a policeman !
“Don’t interrupt, dear,’’ Babette hurriedly
said. “The policeman told me that a sus-
picious person had been seen by one of the
neighbors in our garden, and seeing the light
at that time of night he had called to make
sure that everything was all right. All the
time I knew that the burglar was waiting
just round the corner; but I didn’t give him
away.”
“But why not?” I asked my wife. “He
wouldn’t have dared to shoot you, with a
policeman at the door.”
“Of course not,” said Babette. “I could
have called in the policeman, and that would
have been the end of the burglar; but all
the time I had an idea in my mind. So I
explained to the policeman that there was
no sign of any burglar, and that I had
come down to get some medicine for Babette-
kins. So off the policeman went, satisfied;
and I turned round to tell the burglar that
it was all right. He couldn’t understand
why I had saved him, and I didn’t tell him.
“ ‘Now,’ I said to him —he was looking
quite dazed —‘you must be dreadfully hun-
gry. I know I am. You burglars must
be accustomed to irregular meals. Why
shouldn’t we have a nice little supper in
the kitchen? Come along! Or if you’re
afraid of the policeman coming back, I could
let you out by the back door. It ought to
be quite safe by now.’
“Just as I expected, the burglar didn’t
like my suggestion that he was scared of
the policeman. In the presence of a lady,
too, though that lady had precious little on.
< “ ‘All right, lady,’ he said. ‘Thank you.
I’m on’; and I got out that cold chicken and
a bottle of beer. I didn’t like to offer him
your whisky. I could see a look in his eye
that warned me that whisky might be dan-
gerous—to me. Well, we had quite a plea-
sant little supper. It’s no use your being
angry, darling. You’ll see what happened.
“We got on famously together, and the
way the poor man ate that chicken and drank
that beer told me that he must have been
almost starved. And when he had finished
he sat comfortably back in his chair, and
we talked of all sorts of things. He had
had a most interesting life, with all sorts
of thrilling things happening to him at night.
But he rather nicely said that he had never
had such a delightful evening as this. I
said that it was rather awkward for me to
keep up the spirit of the evening when I
didn’t even know what sort of face he had.
‘Why don’t you take that black mask-thing
off?’ I asked him. ‘l’m sure you’ve got nice
eyes.’ I said.
“That seemed to touch him ; and he let
me take his mask off.”
I was rightly indignant as I listened to
Babette’s story. “So you took off his mask
for him?” I expostulated.
“Well,” protested Babette, “he seemed to
enjoy it. We were like old friends by then—
the beer and the chicken and the talk. I
never knew beer was so nice. And, do you
know, dear, he was thrillingly handsome!
Such attractive eyes, and quite a good nose.
I’ve told you about his dominant chin,
haven’t I? He was all the Sheiks in one
that I’ve ever seen at the movies. I really
felt afraid he’d make love to me, or catch me
up in his muscular arms—his nails were
quite clean —and carry me off to —to his den.
I suppose! And when in a mournful tone
he told mo that he had always been mis-
understood. I felt that I’d like to cheer him
up by sitting on his knee. Of course, I
did nothing of the sort, dear; though it
would have been a wonderful experience to
be kissed by the only desperado I have ever
met in my life. What girl wouldn’t? What
wife wouldn’t? If yoxx had only been a des-
perado I wouldn’t have wanted another; but
it isn't every wife who has the chance to
go desperadoing with a handsome burglar.
“And then lie told me how nice I had
been to send the policeman away, and then —
we were both leaning over the little table —I
asked him if he would do a little thing for
me in return for the way I had treated him.
“ ‘Anything you like to ask.’ he said with
a look that made me feel all shivery with
delight and a teeny little bit of fear. I
can manage most men ; but I wasn’t quite
sure about burglars.
“ ‘Well,’ I said, ‘give me back my jewels
that you’ve got in your pocket and the money
you took fi’om my husband’s dressing-table.’
“lie was surprised all right; but he was
a sport. ‘You’ve beaten me, my lady,’ lie
muttered. ‘So that’s why you didn’t give
me away to the policeman ! I might have
known that I was dealing with a woman.’
“ ‘Here’s your jewels,’ he said, handing
them over. ‘lt’s a present for you; but I
need that money badly.’
“ ‘No,’ I smiled at him ; ‘be a sport and
give me the money, too.’ ”
“He looked at me for a while, and then
he said, ‘You can have the money back. too.
if you seal the bargain, my dear.’
“Yes, dearest,” Babette went on with a
sigh, “he called me ‘my dear,’ and he meant
it. So there was nothing for me-but to carry
out my share of the bargain.
“I meant it to be only a butterfly kiss,
dearest; but he rather took a mean advan-
tage of me.”
“You kissed him, a man like that!” I
indignantly cried.
Babette mused for a few moments. “1
told you about his dominant chin and his
adorable eyes, didn’t I, dearest? But it was
such a thrilling kiss ! I never get one like
that nowadays, do I? Of course, I hated it;
but I simply had to get your monev back.
But he was rather mean, as I told you.
There were twelve pounds, and he handed
them over in twelve separate instalments,
with a kiss between each of them. Still. I
told myself that I was sacrificing myself
for you; and I learnt something about kisses
from him. So that’s that, darling; and I’ve
saved you pounds and pounds. You ought
to be deeply grateful for all I’ve done for
you; and I washed my face immediately I
had seen him out of the back door. Dar-
ling, you seem annoyed? Won’t you come
to me and thank me for all I’ve done?”
I wouldn’t.

FOX
The fine West ofEngland Cloths
of Fox Bros, are demanded to
the exclusion of all other cloths
by those who have once worn
them.
Fine cloths call for fine yarns,
finely spun from finest Australian
wools.
To produce a light-weight Fox
superfine cloth it is necessary to
spin the yarn to such fineness
that a mile weighs less than an
ounce.
Look for the Fox Trade Mark
which gives entire satisfaction
because it is backed by this
guarantee
Fox’s Cloths are all pure wool
and will not shrink or fade by
land, sea or air.

The Matter of Taste.
[WENT behind a waddling woman,
Whitewashed and rouged and scai-cely
human;
The dame was young, though by her tread
She seemed most vastly overfed ;
And also, if it must be stated,
Both overdressed and overweighted,
While round her, hot and crudely scented,
The atmosphere seemed quite demented.
The perfumed savage held the street,
And rolled along on shuffling feet,
Permitted thus to walk by law
And hurt the sense of all who saw.
A crippled soldier stood aside
And watehed the mass of beef and hide
And silk and jewels till the smell
On distant kerbs and woodblocks fell,
Then murmured that it seemed amiss
That men should win the war for this!
A gleam, a light, a means of grace
Crowned by a living, laughing face—
All l'isks of death, all risks of life
Seem fair when watching Jobson’s wife!
Her fairy step, her rhythmic motion
Lightly embroidered with a notion
Worked out in something sweet and simple
As the pink satin of her dimple—
I think the whole world would concur
The war was rightly won for her.
Both Paradise and Hell may be
Observed across our cakes and tea.
There fashion’s loud and heavy slave
Links George-street with the primal cave.
Out of her hut the waddling woman.
Painted and draped and scarcely human,
With shark’s-tooth bead and fur and feather
Links all degraded time together,
Proclaimixig in the latest style
That life is clearly not worth while.
But, as if morning’s lips had kissed her,
Here comes her dainty, tripping sister,
Proclaiming by the height of fashion
The hope of great years of compassion
When the good gods shall let us be
The best-dressed folk beneath a tree
In the new vales of Arcady.
If women with no taste and pride
Would promptly turn to suicide,
A perfect woman nobly planned
Would note the fact and undei’stand;
A more imperfect one than she
Would sigh and let the problem Be,
Saved always from the wish to doom her
Dull sister by her sense of humor.

Oh, La!
LET Sniffkins snuffle, but, gadzooks!
There’s more in life than’s writ in
books:
Such earnest of God’s gracious gifts
As wenches drest in dainty shifts,
Snug damsels slick and unafraid
And many a lithe, seductive jade
Whose cosy elbows lisp and croon
Enticement to the peering moon ;
Slim, twinkling ankles exquisite,
And bosoms eloquently bright
As wine whereon the bubble is,
(Gee whiz !)
Neat, nestling ears that plead and woo;
Shoulders that yearn, and calves that coo;
Plump peaches with hut bloom upon ’em;
Rich curves for those who love to con ’em;
Delicious nymphs; cute, dimpled knees,
And ardent insteps sure to please
Chaste, simple souls like you and me
\viio still take muffins with our tea;
Swift dames adorable with legs
(Like Julia’s) smooth as new-laid eggs,
And sweet young things that cling and coodle
Down where the ocean wavelets croodle.

His Amendment.
’ J j WAS on a Sunday afternoon I listened
1 to the views
Of one who fulminated on the foolish-
ness of Booze.
He seemed an earnest Christian soul, to give
the man his dues.
No in personam arguments came from his
fluent tongue;
I never heard him advocate that brewers
should be hung,
Or doubt if Hell were punishment sufficient
for a Bung.
He cursed no wobbling Governments for
blowing cold and hot
Regarding local-option polls, nor did he urge
a lot
Of politicians should be stacked against a
wall and shot.
No jaundiced Pussyfoot, I mused; no
venomed bigot here —
A sturdy Prohibitionist, but temperate, ’tis
clear;
He keeps his animosity for rum and gin and
beer.
For whisky and the ills it brings in its be-
muddling train,
For pinkie, port and creme de mcnthc, for
absinthe and champagne—
All these and more did he condemn that day
in the Domain.
His clarion voice rang out like that of some
crusading monk,
Old Omar Khayyam’s easy creed he stigma-
tised as punk.
“There is no pleasure.” he averred, “no fun
in getting drunk.”
An aged man beside me stood in an indif-
ferent hat,
And as he chewed the thesis o’er impartially
he spat
As one -who mildly hesitates to go as far
as that.
It seemed that this unspoken doubt the
Reeliabite had read.
He fixed us with a glittering eye. “You
question it?” he said
With scepticism in his tone. My neighbor
shook his head.
“I wouldn’t go into the box and kiss the
Book and swear
No pleasure lies in getting canned; but if
you should declare
There’s none in getting sober. Boss —by
Gripes, I’m with you there!”

Herself.
AS I sauntered out this morning,
Oh, my heart was all my own!
And a wholesome heart it was,
Having neither grief nor groan.
But the Fates they were against me,
And to fight the Fates is ill,
And ’twas they that sent Herself
Dressed to capture or to kill.
And ’twas they (a plague upon them!)
Sent the fever to my head,
And the folly to my tongue,
And the foolish words I said:
“And where would you be going,
And what would you be at,
With the sunlight on you glowing,
And your fine cloak and hat?”
As I sauntered out this morning,
’Twas the wholesome heart I bore,
And that heart was all my own,
But ’tis mine, alas! no more.
For the Fates were dark against me.
Though the skies were bright and gay.
And ’twas they that sent Herself,
Knowing just what she would say.
Though her throat was round and snowy,
And her eyes were sweet and clear,
And her face was like a flower,
Yet her words were ill to hear.
She spoke, and at her laughter,
My heart went pit-a-pat:
“’Tis Himself, not you, I’m after
With my fine cloak and hat!”

The gospel true:
That you really must be careful what
you eat.

Shun the hot and tempting scone.

Doubting Thomas you may be,
But this creed appeals to me;
Yea, these tidings I most ardently believe,
For T know that all our ills.
More than those allayed by pills—

THE flowers of Spring are praised in song
By sentimental folk who won't think:
But oh ! the gardener's woes and wrongs!
“The Sweet o’ the Year!” Not half! I
don't think!
Spring butterflies so light and gay
Inspire to verse our lyric thrillers,
Forgetful that the rotters lay
The eggs that hatch out caterpillars.
My lawns are pert with yellow heads
Of dandelions defying slaughter;
In gravel paths and pansy beds
The grass grows where it didn’t oughter.
What though fat woolly lambkins play,
The woolly blight its fluff discloses
On leafy twigs, and day by day
The aphis fattens on my roses.
What though the warbling dicky-birds
Are nesting in their merry millions?
The slug and snail and beetle herds
Bring forth in billions and in trillions.
While prisoned, helpless, through the panes
I watch the garden’s foes destroy it- —
In Spring it rains and rains and rains,
And all the little brutes enjoy it!

And greaves and glaives! ’Twere better
done
If Brute had pricked me years before;
My Gallic Wars were not so fought
If beery bottles I had sought.”
And Arthur pines, a kingly shade,
And lays aside his cherished blade:
“My knights were bold and worthy, too,
In knightly . skill and practice pat. .
Immune from points that shrewdly prick
At sheeted tin and such as that;
But Mordred would have veiled his sneer
Had they been armed with bottled beer.
And so there dawns a direful day
When commandants will live to say:
“Away with guns and blades and pikes
That pierce or puncture, slice or tear,
And get each man (choose each his size)
A vessel that has held its beer:
And list on every dress parade
A corked and stoppered Bottle Brigade.

[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
THE air of well-being of the little cot-
tage had enticed him. He had
observed it before.
A gibbous moon humped itself moodily
near the western horizon, Antares trembled
redly overhead, and a large brilliant planet,
Jupiter for choice, burned over the east. It
was really too light for such as he. Like
spiritualistic phenomena and the wonders
of wireless, his profession prospered, more
exceedingly in times of twilight than under
the glare of any orb whatever.
But he was far from the beat of the
homely John, and even the orderly mind of
an honors crook owning a methodical engage-
ment-book has occasional impulses. The
nocturnal stroll, therefore, deviated from the
rough road, and he walked with a business-
like stride, but noiseless, through the natty
garden to the well-kept cottage, assuming
by this means, as the song says, “to look
like what he ain’t!”
The door yielded to his touch, and he en-
tered a small square hall. A light which
had been dimly observable through a bed-
room blind guided him now on the right, and
he tiptoed to the door which, standing ajar,
allowed some beams to escape.
Pushing the door the least bit, he was able
to catch a view of part of the interior.
It was lit by a shaded lamp which he could
not see, but which probably stood on the
mantel. The warmth of the atmosphere float-
ing outwards was assurance of a fire burn-
ing in the grate, and the room appeared cosily
if not grandly furnished.
He could see portion of a double-bed and
a cot standing beside it. The place had appa-
rently been wrapped in slumber, but imme-
diately on his arrival developments occurred
rapidly.
A small hump in the cot suddenly became
animated: a child’s frightened cry cut
through the stillness, terminating in a stran-
gled gasp, and two little hands clenched into
convulsive fists shot up, the body stiffening.
With an exclamation of alarm a young
woman lying on the edge of the big bed
flung off a coverlet and slipped to her feet.
She had a white skin, blue eyes and short,
fluffy fair hair like a child’s, and a warm
scarlet gown enfolded her small form. She
leant over the child, and a cry of terror rang
from her.
“O God, what shall I do? He’s dying!”
The door was pushed a little farther into
the room. She flew to the toilet-table in dis-
traction for a bottle, which, however, was
cast away in doubt, and she stood with dis-
tended eyes, clenching her hands —“Oh, dear
God, help me!”
“Where’s ’er fool man ?” the onlooker
growled indignantly to himself, and shoved
the door a little wider to assure himself that
the fool man was not in the hitherto con-
cealed portion of the double-bed.
The action disclosed the visitor, and like
a distracted whirlwind the young woman in
the scarlet gown descended on him. “My
child —my baby! Save him!” she cried.
That the entry was irregular and the
being addressed a man she had never before
seen carried no weight at this juncture. It
was the child’s safety which was the essen-
tial thing, not explanations and the lack
of a formal introduction.
He saw the point, and like the cool-headed
man of action that he was, in a step he was
at the side of the cot and bending over the
rigid little form.
“Got any lemons?” he jerked out. “Get
some juice—smart now.” Then with a
stride he was at the mantel and had snapped
up a little jar of vaseline his keen eyes had
assimilated. With a supple forefinger he
scooped out a generous lump, and almost
in the same motion had it thrust well down
the throat of the child, following it with a
second application. Taking the tumbler and
spoon from the mother’s trembling fingers
he poured down the raw lemon-juice she had
squeezed out. But the vaseline had begun
tlm work of melting through the phlegm
which had risen in the child’s throat, and
the lemon-juice now cut it away and cleared
the passage.
The little fingers unclenched, the body
turned, the purpling face paled, and the
little boy began to cry hoarsely, his arms
outstretched to his mother. Throwing a
large woollen shawl round him she clasped
him to her breast with kisses and caresses,
her fair curls mingling with his, so like in
texture and hue.
It was the stranger’s unobtrusive retreat
which recalled her, and she looked up with
eyes shining with gratitude.
“How can I ever thank you enough!”
she exclaimed. “You’ve saved my baby’s
life. His father’s away working overtime —
I expect him at any minute now”—with a
glance at the clock. “Bonnie’s been unwell
all day, and I get just terrified when he’s
that way. Thank you so much, so very
much.”
She followed him to the door, anxious to
do or say something that should prove the
joy and gratitude filling her heart. “I don't
know how you knew what to do —every-
thing I’ve ever heard of flies clean out of
my head. I’m a fool; but you”
“Aw, it’s jest practice, lady. I’ve eleven
of me own—kids is all alike. Give ’im a
warm drink and stow ’im in ’is bunk, and
’e’ll be all right. I was just passin’—
workin’ late meself —seen your light and
’eard the nipper cry. Good night, lady. No
thanks —I’ll be off. Good night.”
With each word lie was a step further
out.
“Don’t you come out in the cold or you'll
do in ’is chances. I’ll let meself out.” And
he firmly closed the bedroom door in her
face, and walked to the front door, opening
it noisily. Then, turning like an eel, he
slipped through the opposite door into the
dining-room. The light of a torch _ disclosed
the simple and inexpensive furnishings of a
worker’s living-room—comfortable, tidy, but
cheap. The trained eye ran keenly round
it, coming to anchor on a small pile of
silver left on the end of the mantel to be
convenient for the tradesmen. He took a
step forward, hesitated, then swung round
As he marched down the road bitter objur-
gations on his own spinelessness passed
through his mind, countering with the last
passionate asseveration of ‘ I lulty- air
(thus he identified her) —“If ever I can do
anything on this earth to help you m any
way I will.” And that *‘l will” carried more
power than any marriage service ever put
into it.
To little Fluffy-’air herself the memory of
the strange man brought nothing but anthems
of praise and thankfulness, whatever con-
struction “ ’er fool man” may have put upon
the actions of the party who was just passm
by, workin’ late, like himself. The fool man
was, however, wise enbugh to keep his doubts
to himself.
But a day or two later, as Mrs. Heywood
sat sunning herself in the side verandah,
scanning the daily news, with young Fluffy
playing joyously in the sandy path, she gave
a little gasp and sat staring into the inscrut-
able countenance of the Strange Man looking
at her from the broadsheet.
“Oh!” she said. “Oh !” and hastily read
the accompanying statements regarding her
friend, the saviour of her baby. “I’m sure
he didn’t do it—sure! Those reporters will
say anything.”
The mendacious gentleman stated that
John Arthur Freeman had been arrested on
a charge of being implicated in several smart
burglaries which had been brought off in the
district at different stations up and down the
line, and one on the very night of her intro-
duction to him. Not that he had been caught
in the act—the evidence was entirely circum-
stantial, but strong. It was stated that he
had been seen in the neighborhood of the
last exploit shortly before it had taken place
at 11 p.m., though he himself denied this,
declaring he had been on his way home miles
away at the time. He was to be brought up
before a magistrate on the following day.
Unpicturesque and ordinary law courts
stuff, with an extremely un-Itaffles-like pro-
tagonist, yet the Freeman case provided an
unexpected and rather intriguing incident
for the reporters’ pencils on the morrow.
Police evidence had been given in the last
and most noted of the robberies. Counsel
for the defence then called on its one and
only witness, and a young and pretty person,
clad .in her most becoming raiment, stepped
into the grimy stand to do battle for her
hero, the saviour of her baby.
“Fluffy-’air!” murmured the prisoner
admiringly.
Her evidence was that, as Mr. Freeman
had been in her house upon that particular
night, ministering to • her baby at the very
time, 11 p.m., when he was said to have been
seen some miles in another direction, the
only deduction to be made was that it might
have been his double, but could not have been
Mr. Freeman himself, who had thus been
observed.
No amount of badgering «ould shake her
evidence. She distinctly remembered look-
ing at the clock which had just registered
11 and saying to her visitor that she expected
her husband home at any time. Therefore
it could not by any possibility be John A.
Freeman who was seen at 11 p.m. some miles
south on the line. Even had he possessed a
motor-car he could not have eaten up some
rather bad bits of road in a few minutes,
and with a push-bike—which it was shown
he did possess—it was entirely out of the
question.
Mrs. Heyw.ood’s evidence remaining un-
shaken, the case for the whole series of bur-
glaries. being based on the last, thus fell to
the ground. Freeman was discharged, and
outside the courthouse a lucky camera caught
Fluffy-’air shaking hands delightedly with
a well-known crook, while a baffled detective
viewed the drama ruefully.
It was only when Fluffy-’air, in the secu-
rity of her own bedroom, was drawing off her
gloves that she allowed herself the relaxation
of a heavy sigh of relief as she glanced up
at her old clock on the mantelpiece.
“Well, old dear,” she said, “it doesn’t
matter, does it, that you were a whole hour
fast that night when he saved our little dar-
ling’s' life!”

The Return.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
Love, light as a swallow.
Came on a shining wing
And called me to the hollow
Under the ledge of Spring
Where the green ferns follow
The song the waters sing.
Love, strong as the burning
Of great trees in the wind,
Held my steps from turning
With dear eyes and kind;
For I was full of yearning
And all my heart was blind.
I heard the mountains quaking,
I saw the torrents fall;
And the sudden echoes waking
Sent call on call
To the place of my forsaking
Where the silver trees were tall.
Love, fair as the gleaming
Of pearls in an agate bowl,
Wrapped the hair of her dreaming
Round and round my soul
Till I knew not sense from seeming
Nor the part from the living whole.
And we came back walking,
Who went on swallow wings,
Love with love talking
Of unimagined things,
And our tall shadows stalking
Through infinite pale springs.
Love, soft as the greening
Of moss on a grey stone,
To happy love was leaning,
Brave on the magic grown
From the heart of the heart of the meaning
Of a word spoken alone.

[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
NEVER having inherited anything my-
self except cacoethes scribcnd% I do
not know exactly what Eve’s sensa-
tions were when she opened the packet con-
taining the particulars of the land that had
been unexpectedly left to her; but I noticed
her fingers shook. At first sight the con-
tents of the packet were disappointingly
prosaic. There were some old accounts,
brown at the edges, with details of moneys
expended on clearing, ringbarking, making a
road and building a bridge. There was a
miner’s right and an assay that some for-
gotten optimist had obtained from the De-
partment of Mines. It stated that the
samples submitted consisted of green-stained
ochreous rock —which sounds rather hand-
some—ferruginous sandy clayshale, calcareous
clayshale and just ordinary, common or gar-
den clayshale; but of the precious metals
there was “nil” or only a “trace.” There
were several official notices, rising rapidly
to a crescendo of imperativeness, concerning
non-payment of rates and non-fulfilment of
the conditions of improvement under which
the grant had been made; and there was a
bundle of letters.
As we picked our way through these the
story of the inheritance began to take shape.
Many of the letters, addressed to people from
people Eve had never heard of, were unin-
telligible. Even the most intimate were writ-
ten in a style that nowadays we associate
with legal documents. Many links with that
past of nearly a hundred years ago had long
been broken ; but slowly out of the phrases
of that inexpressive correspondence between
dead great-aunts and great-uncles who always
seemed to be on their very best behavior, the
picture formed, an atmosphere of romance
began to thicken round the faded sheets and
the characters to step out of them and move
about the stage.
“I feel the pecuniary weight,” writes the
father of Eve’s ancestor from Sussex to his
sister in N. S. Wales under date July 30,
1828, “of a large family of eight children
and fifteen grandchildren. Thank God,
though not in affluence, yet I am still in easy
circumstances. The placing of our children
in the world has certainly required on our
part strict economy and great deduction of
income. I have now to recommend to your
good advice and friendly attention my second
son, Charles, ivho is going out to Port Jack-
son to take up the grant of 2560 acres. I
have remitted for him £2OOO. It is there-
fore not any pecuniary aid he requires, but
solely good advice. If his conduct is good,
though not very successful he cannot very
Avell want.”
Armed with this not too optimistic recom-
mendation, but in his pocket £2OOO and a
grant of Crown land, obtained through some
personage of sufficient influence. Charles
’came out,” presumably to try his fortune
“in the colonies.” His first letters are from
Sydney; but whether it was a romantic
spirit, a love of gain or adventure or a rest-
less desire for change that brought him, his
formal phrases do not show; certainly two
years later the grant of 2560 acres was still
lying virgin in the bush. In 1831 he writes
to some unknown person from Sydney: “I
have been revolving in my mind the kind
offer contained in your last to exert your
interest in my favor should anything turn
up in the way of an appointment in this
colony. I have been consulting an intimate
friend of mine who fills a high situation here,
and lie concurs with me that there is nothing
decidedly at present open in that way, nor
do I think there will be anything I could
with proper respect to myself accept of. all
minor situations in the gift of the local
Government being filled by a set of people
a few degrees removed from convicts.... As
for settling, it ap-
pears to me a ruin-
o u s speculation.
You must invest the
whole of your capi-
tal without deriv-
ing any return to
enable you to
carry on. This
leads, of course,
to borrowing, and
from thence to a
sheriff’s execution
.... and there ends
t h e unfortunate
settler.” Whic h
suggests that
things in those
days' were much as
things are to-day.
Nevertheless, by
1830 such city life
as Sydney could
offer had lost its
charm for Charles.
“I expect in a few
weeks,” he writes,
“to retire into the
interior, where I
shall be the best
part of 100 miles
from the nearest
post office. I have
lately bought a
flock of sheep, and
with them I shall
go to the distance 1
mentioned outside the lines and stick to
the thing five or six years, and then see the
condition lam in... .1 shall come into head-
quarters once or twice a year for supplies,
and that is all I shall have to say to Sydney.”
Regretfully he adds: “Had I done so six
years back I should now be in the receipt of
my three thousand a year.”
By 1837 he had repented his precipitation.
“If I possibly can,” lie says, “I shall make
my way to the New Settlement. It is time
some of us should migrate, for we are get-
ting crowded in this country, and people are
squabbling and fighting for land.” In 1837!
Troubles began rapidly to close upon him.
“We have within these few months,” he says
in a letter to his brother in 1838, “witnessed
nothing but a scene of bankruptcy, and wlie-
ther it is now drawing to a close or we have
only seen the commencement of it, Heaven
only knows... .We hear our convict servants
are to be taken from us in a year or two. I
would gladly get some of your laborers out
and give them each £2O a year and feed them
besides, were I not sure they would be
seduced from my service by a promise of
much higher wages before three months had
elapsed.” Apparently Eve’s ancestor sur-
vived the financial crisis, for the following
year he writes again : “The country has for
some time past been in a very disturbed
state. Gangs of armed felons have been
roving about, robbing and murdering wher-
ever they went. My station has been sacked
(to use a cant word) as well as the rest,
and property (valuable at this distance from
Sydney) to a considerable amount taken and
destroyed.” It was the last of the letters,
and the suggestion of a sudden and disastrous
THE DIFFERENCE.

MR. BACHELOR : “May be; but he’s not reminded of it so often as
the married sort are.”
ending to the enterprise invested it with an
atmosphere of mystery, and made us eager
to inspect what remained of the property
in “the interior,” “a hundred miles outside
the lines.”
To-day it lies only a few miles from the
railway between Sydney and Newcastle. The
stationmaster of the little wayside station
that was nearest to it had never heard of it.
“Unless it’d be over M way,” he re-
marked reflectively. Eve thrilled to hear her
kinsman’s name attached to an Australian
township. Following up that clue we walked
into the undulations of the hills. The red
road wound between sweet-smelling orchards
of oranges and lemons —a red road whose
floor was carpeted with tiny yellow flowers,
and sloped up out of the fat valley on to lean
hillsides backed by l-olling leagues of bush.
A track led up over a spur. We came on a
hut standing in the ruins of an orchard and
a house, gone cold many years ago, but not
so long ago as to have had any dealings with
Charles M . Further on we came on a
little house in a clearing, with smoke com-
ing out of the chimney and a little old
woman chopping wood. At our approach she
lifted a wrinkled face as brown as dead gum-
leaves and called to her husband, who was
mending a fence near by. They were both
crippled with rheumatism, but they straight-
ened their old backs as well as they could
and invited us on to the verandah. They had
given up growing anything long ago—kept
a cow or two, but that was getting too
much for them; almost too much to chop the
firewood necessary for cookiug and heating.
We wondered what becomes of the pioneers
of the bush after they have beaten the bush
back and age creeps on them and the bush
returns. It was creeping now under the
fence and closing round the house.
Yes, this block was part of the old M——
grant. Beyond there in the valley, full of
houses and orchards, and across over the
main ridge, were the old boundaries of the
grant. What we stood on was all that was
left after the Government resumption—lo(l
acres 3 roods. Just this ridge and the three
gullies below us, alive with murmuring
streams, converging into a basin in which
great wliite-trunked mahoganies, blackbutts
like giants with their sleeves rolled back
shaking defiant arms at the sky, and huge
sombre ironbarks stood ankle-deep in a
jungle of tree-ferns, bungalow’s, supplejack
and lawyer-vine. And up to the crest of the
stony mountain opposite, from which over
rolling hills one could see the Blue Moun-
tains and a crescent of ocean between two
crumbling headlands.
Eve stood momentarily enjoying the lust
of pure possession, just as Charles M
may have stood nearly a hundred years ago.
A bullock-team with three great logs on the
jinker crawled slowly over the ridge aud dis-
appeared like a brown serpent into the bush
beyond. They had been pulling timber out
of that valley, off and on, the old man said,
for the past twenty years.
Returning to the railway station Eve in-
dulged her parental fancy. She cleared the
bush off ten of the fattest acres —being care-
ful. however, to preserve the natural beauties
of the place—erected a neat cottage with an
aerial attached and a smooth run at the west
corner for an aerodrome, and placed her son,
still an infant, in possession. At the station
we met the stationmaster.
“Did you find what you were lookin’ for? - ’
he asked. Eve answered in the affirmative,
and expatiated on the wonders of the place.
“Don’t know of any block around here an-
swering to that description,” he said dubi
ously.
We explained more explicitly its situation.
“Oh, that section!” he ejaculated, as he
turned to shift the points for the Sydney
train. “I don’t like to hurt your feelings,
missus, but to be frank with you, if you’re
thinkin’ of {/rowin' anything—well, I wouldn’t
have it on me mind!”

The sun, shining out joyously for Ilenley-
on-Yarra, beckoned the crowds m their thou-
sands to the oak-shaded sward which
stretches for miles along either side ot the
river - and even the grey water did its best
to look blue. The decorated craft were more
numerous, if less ambitious in design, than
last year’s lot; and while every river girl
had dressed the occasion with her summer
hat, the wliite-flannelled males blotted the
landscape with felt tiles or courted sunstroke
with college caps. Never has the Melbourne
flapper flapped more decorously. Not 1 pei
cent, had bared arms to the sun, and fewer
still had hitched their skirts above the calf-
line —perhaps because the artificial silk hose
of to-day thickens to cotton well below the
knee Instead of the usual houseboat flotilla
a fleet of beflagged and beflowered two-
deckers rode at anchor along the gravelled
terrace walk.
Among the few philanthropists to spread
tea and hospitality were the Mayoral Brun-
tons, the lady becomingly frocked in navy
silks. Tea, cakes and something with a stick
in it were on tap during afternoon and even-
ing; and Mr. Dewar, head of the Town
Hall staff, saw that all was shipshape. A
wireless on the upper deck added to the
gaiety of the top-side crowd. The G.-G.
dropped in for a time, but otherwise vice-
royalty was busily engaged in seeing Night
Patrol do his dash. The prize for the best-
decorated craft went to a Mah .Tongg crew
rigged up as Chinamen, who nobly dropped
the ten-pound prize money into the Incapa-
citated Soldiers’ Fund.
Henley banks and lawns were hidden by
trampling feet on Saturday night, when the
admission fee fell from 3s. to a modest bob.
The place had been lighted up into a great
white way, and Chinese lanterns outlining
the houseboats moored by the river-brim, and
bobbing Peter Pannishly from the lighter
craft, added to the dazzle. Fireworks
assaulted the dumbfounded heavens, while
couples jazzed below on a specially shaven
grass plot. Despite Henley crowds and
crammed playhouses, the city streets were
congested with motors and humans, and
getting home would have been a perilous
problem but for the general good humor of
the crowd. Alexandra-avenue must have
offered a heart-throb to homesick emigrants
with its suggestion of a London bank-
holiday beanfeast, with lads and lassies whirl-
ing on the green and making merry with
ticklers and packet ice-creams.
Brilliant sunshine woke the roses and
drew the biggest crowd on record to Moonee
Valley for the Spring Meeting on that well-
appointed course. Even the horses did their
best to make the afternoon a memorable one,
and Lady Stradbroke arrived in a cocoa-blue
(■ape frock just in time to see the Governor s
Night Patrol win his race. The favorite
Stand By and the Very consistent Gloaming
were also among the winners. Well-tailored
coats and skirts were most favored by the
female throng. Admiral Hall Thompson’s
dame w-as there in navy blue, and Mrs. Non
Niall in black marocain. Mrs. J. G.
Purves’s black hat glittered with silver, shad-
ing a gown of black crepe romaine, and
Mrs. Leslie Macdonald flaunted tangerine
and bramble wool, with a vivid little hat
that looked like a drift of autumn leaves.
Hundreds of music-lovers found the Town
Hall doors shut on them on Friday night
when the grand-opera stars gave th,eir fare-
well concert. All the musical chiefs had
turned out, and half St. Ivilda Jewry emptied
itself into the hall. Granforte, who topped
his dress shoes with a dashing pair of white
socks, and Phyllis Archibald, who twinkled
in a grey beaded gown, had to work over-
time in response to the hungry encores.
Laurel wreaths lassoed the male singers, and
flowers bombarded the ladies —Phyllis Archi-
bald was equipped with enough stock-in-trade
to open a florist’s shop.
The King’s Theatre was packed from
attic to cellar on Saturday night for Irene
Vanbrugh and “Aren’t We All?” and every
woman in the audience levelled green rays
of envy on the succession of heavenly frocks
released by the star and other mem-
bers of the company. At the final curtain,
after the ladies of the co. had crawled
from under the landslide of flowers, a speech
was demanded of Dion Boucicault, who
jestingly described the house as “rude” _in
dragging-out a tired mummer to talk, a thing
once done only on last nights. All he said,
however, was “Thank you, and thank you,”
so the effort did not cost him much mental
strain One of Irene Vanbrugh s _ trio ot
Paris creations suggested an academic robe;
another was a wrap-over affair ot black,
trailing a train.
Another group of those one knows were
over at the Royal for “The Silent Witness,
wherein Muriel Starr airs several smart
frocks, and one delightful little pull-on lid m
black velvet. Jessie Page, being the rich girl
of the piece, wears some even more attractive
frocks. One evening-dress in rose-colored
velvet, weighted with brown fur nt the hem,
earned approving stares.
The balmy air of a glorious week-end
thawed the pockets of the frostiest-hearted
citizen, and lifted the figures of the Hospi-
tal Saturday and Sunday appeal in connec-
tion with the Mayor’s fund to a record height.
After the officials of the Bank of Victoria
had worn their fingers to the bone counting
the threepences, the result was announced as
f 18,802, which is six times the total of IS <S,
when the fund was started. E. G. Hicks,
who organised the highway robbery, pro-
mises to do even worse next year.
The Caulfield Boy Scouts turned out joy-
ously as a guard of honor for Lord Forster
when he opened a floral fete at St. Cather-
ine’s, Caulfield, one day last week. Vicar
Schweiger had the help of his wife, local
Mayor Morris and the fete sec., Mrs. Flewel-
lin, in welcoming the G.-G., who apologised
for his lady’s absence owing to her daugh-
ter’s illness, praised local patriotism and
made a dignified exit with an unembarrassed
smile and a presentation box of sweets especi-
ally made for her Ex.
Admiral Hall Thompson’s wife, who con-
voyed daughter Valerie, presided over the
Seamen’s Mission meeting on Friday in the
Fred Paynes’ South Yarra drawing-room.
The welfare of the Ladies’ Harbor Lights
Guild, which helps to keep Jack ashore from
taking the wrong path, was the business of
the afternoon. Literature in the tongues of
many lands is urgently required, and more
members are needed to help dispense hospi-
tality at the Guild cheerios; the general
public can assist in one way by buying the
Christmas Calendar, jointly designed by Mrs.
Daryl Lindsay and Mrs. Drought.
The Best dame brightened the Alexandra
Club drawing-room on Thursday afternoon
with a cheery tea-drinking, pleasurably punc-
tuated by music and elocution. Roses
nodded fragrantly from every angle of the
big parlor where the popular lady, flanked
by daughters Margot and Phyllis, welcomed
the invited. Her black dress carried an
upper stratum of magpie effects. Golden-
haired Phyllis dimpled above a black frock
and hat, while Margot colored the family
group with Tuttishly-patterned black and
yellow. Mrs. Broinowski fiddled delight-
fully, Yvonne Deschamps warbled, and
Biddy Allen provided a piano solo. A trio
of recitations revealed that Phyllis Best’s
voiee and artistry have increased out of all
knowledge since she crept into the profes-
sion as maid to Emelie Polini in “My Lady s
Dress.” The advance has been made under
the tutelage of Gaston Mervale.
This is Broothorn’s idea of Mrs. Thorald
Harper, the Toorak lady who has helped so
strenuously to lift the Mermaid Repertory
Society on to
the high road
of success.
Mrs. Harper
was an Eng-
lish girl, who
left her native
land about
A rmistice
time to marry
her A n z a c
major and
settle down
as a good Aus-
tralian. Keen
on any liter-
ary movement
she linked up
with the Mer-
maids soon
after landing
in Melbourne,
and for some
time varied
her committee
work by serving as the society’s unpaid
secretary.
A matinee at the Palace Theatre last
week will thrust a cheque for nearly six
hundred into the R. C. Children’s Charities
money-box. Both vice-regal houses came
along to smile appreciation, the G.-G. and
Lady Forster supported by Miss Carleton
and a gent.-help, and Lord Stradbroke with
daughter Helena. A packed house hung
breathless on the whiskers of “Old Bill,”
who later discarded his walrus outfit to
appear in a smart sketch. “Waiting for a
Lady,” with Ellaline Terriss as the lady.
During the grand-opera season in Mel-
bourne a Federal M.P. who did not miss a
production Avas Frank Anstey, whose white,
professorial hair caused him to be mistaken
by many of the uninitiated for some leading
musical light. Frank sings a good song
himself, and can produce memories of every
opera staged for decades past. Ou the
Melba night one of the quaint features of
the evening Avas the fraternisation of Stan-
ley Bruce. Frank Anstey and the übiquitous
Percy Deane in the manager’s room.
Meet one of Melbourne’s most talented
musical composers, Mabel Down, here pre-
sented by Buskin. The modest little writer
keeps out of
the limelight,
but several of
her songs and
mon 010 gues
are old familiar
friends of the
public. Thou-
sands of An-
zacs, at home
and abroad,
have tramped
to the inspirit-
ing strains of
her “Soldiers’
March,” writ-
ten during the
first months of
the Hun inva-
sion ; and as
many more
have whistled
her patriotic
song, intro-
duced to the
Diggers by George Cowley. But her best-
seller was her setting of Bernard Cronin s
Bulletin verses, “The North Wind,” which
the late Howard White added to his reper-
toire. It was with one of her compositions
that Eileen Pascoe-Webbe scored first prize
for the best Australian song at the Bal-
larat competitions a few years back.
Hobart Sassiety. which had been drows-
ing for weeks, woke up brightly the other
day to an amateur performance of ‘ All
of a Sudden, Peggy,” put on by the “Coax
Company to swell the slender resources of
the local Girls' Guide movement. The big
thrill of the production, a society mannequin
parade, drew crowds from miles around.
The Administrator headed the list of those
present, and modestly scurried away after
the last curtain without waiting to be God-
saved.
Tasmanians feel they liaye a proprietary
right in the cruiser Dunedin, now in Aus-
tralian waters on loan from Britain, the
Dunedin’s Commander Beale being husband
of an ex-Apple Islander, May Youl. Her
sister is ex-Premier Elliott Lewis’s lady, and
a relative was Dr. Youl. who sat on Mel-
bourne’s corpses for many years.
Bridge-plaving, which has quite a lot to
do with the' heavy shrinkage in music-and-
chatter parties, is threatened by the rival
mania for Mali Jongg, which is now shaking
Toorak. Bridge experts, of course, snort
contempt at the Chinese game with its pic-
turesque formalities, as one which calls for
luck and a good memory rather than skill,
one critic describing it as a glorified edition
of “Old Maid.” Naval-Surgeon Gayer
Phipps, who became intimate with Man
.Tongg during his years in Asiatic waters, is
initiating groups of the Best Known into
the mysteries of the East Wind, Dragon and
Great Wall; and an American woman now
visiting this city is showing us how the game
is played in her home town —which is not
at all the Chinese way. However, every-
body is doing it some way; and soon the
cherry-lipped flapper will be heard moaning
over her Mali .Tongg debts instead of her
bridge liabilities.
Again the delightful consistency of the
sex! A member of Melba's Limbless Sol-
diers’ performance committee, and one of
our smartest matrons, strongly objected to
a sweet-stall being set up on the great night,
because she dreaded that Melba’s voice, might
be swamped in the uproar of masticating
chocolates and rustling paper-bags. Despite
her protest, however, the ayes had it. And
then on the auspicious night she made an
effective entrance to a front-circle seat bang
in the middle of the diva’s “Cliiami Minn.’
If looks could have killed she would have
dropped dead in her tracks.
After all, our Medical School’s average
of passes in the final M.B. examination for
1924 is about 30 per cent, higher than that
of the Sydney school. In March there were
long faces when only a beggarly 40 p.c.
of the candidates squeezed through, and de-
jected talk amongst the “ploughed” of be-
coming lawyers or parsons or going on the
land. But the wind has been tempered to
the shorn lambs, for at the deferred examina-
tion in September 67 of the 91 presenting
themselves (including 11 women) were suc-
cessful. so that the pass-average got a big
lift. From 40 p.c. it was increased to 80
p.c., which is extremely high.
The Frank Dobson pair provided a
brighter Sunday for some of their friends
with a tea-drinking in their new South
Yarra home. The popular young matron
hostessed in slinky black crepe with
red georgette streaking down the side and
bold Oriental embroideries on the front
and back panels. Among the throng was
Bowes Kelly, feeling very pleased with the
prize sheep he had reared on his Tasmanian
playground. They had just carried off vari-
ous first awards at the Apple Island show.
TJie inter-State conference of the National
Councils of Women of Australia finished its
arguments this week, and at the final meet-
ing Lady Forster threw a bouquet to the
veteran Mrs. Henry Dobson, of Tasmania,
a founder of the movement and an inter-
national vice-president. After which, of
course, the ladies showed their subservience
to mere man’s ideas by getting up and sing-
ing “For She’s a Jolly Good Fellow!”
The dapper Norman McCance, who drives
an Argus pen, will soon cease to be num-
bered amongst the irresponsible unattached.
The other day he made a confession of in-
tending matrimony with the Malvern Joel
Foxes’ lamb Dorothy, and is now modestly
fielding an avalanche of congratulations.
Another announcement of the same kind
is sounded by James Macartney, son of the
late Edward Macartney and grandson of
the late Dean. He has persuaded the late
David Alsop’s fifth daughter, Vera, to make
him happy.
The John Turnbull widow, who died at
Toorak the other day, will be missed in
philanthropic and social circles. She was
an active and generous committee woman,
and did great work as president of the
Children’s Hospital. Mrs. Turnbull, who
was a Geelong Wooley, leaves one daughter
and a quartette of sons. One of the latter,
John, is married to a daughter of Westralia’s
ex-Chief Justice Parker.
Scobie Mackinnon, with his wife and
young son, is crossing to England shortly.
They will take the lady’s cousin, Mona Offi-
cer, with them. Mrs. Mackinnon’s sister,
Mrs. Cecil Hake, has just been widowed.
Her husband, who died in England a few
days ago, was for some years Inspector of
Explosives for this State.
Judge Norman K. Ewing, of the Speck,
who had been looking for health for some
months on Flinders Island, theother day
returned to duty, apparently fit and well.
But a couple of days in his office wrestling
with arrears of work discovered an unsus-
pected weak spot and sent him hurrying
back to his island. Not the least earnest
of the general regrets expressed are those
of Chief Justice Nicholls and Crisp, J., who
have been for months running the whole
Supreme Court business of the State.
Little Lady Pat Blackwood is not follow-
ing up her stage career in England, after
all, but is going to try her luck in her
mother’s native America. Sister Ursula,
like many other daughters of Mayfair’s new
poor, has plunged into trade as a shop lady.
Iler store is near Londonderry House, where
she is usually to be found behind the per-
fume counter.
Adelaide’s social occasions :
The S.A. Orchestra finished the season, as it com-
menced it, in the Exhibition Building, and had a
bumper house to give a final round of applause.
Grand opera filled most of the programme, with
Hilda Gill and Richard Watson as the soloists and
Harold Parsons’s ’cello to assist. Under W. 11.
Foote’s inspiring baton the orchestra has done
wonderful work, and even if the Government doesn’t
hand over the assistance) it is being asked for some
other method of keeping it alive should certainly
be found.
The Glovers had better weather luck for their
mayoral garden party than the Amateur Turf Club
had for its meeting at Cheltenham. For the latter,
clouds and a keen wind drove woman back to
tailor-mades and heavy coats, but for the former
there was a definite enough hint of summer to
bring her out in the flimsiest and best. The
Glovers was a gargantuan affair; five thousand
invitations had been issued. It was staged at
Victoria Park, where arches and trellises were aglow
with roses, and the way from gate to reception
dais was flanked with towering palms and shrubs.
The mayoral lady’s black frock was .veiled in filmy
lace with a touch of blue and henna at her waist,
and her black hat was circled with vivid leaves.
Colds (every one has ’em) kept Lady Bridges and
Mrs. Glover away from the Amateur Turf Club meet-
ing, but his Ex. was there with Lieut. Brooke and
there was a big muster of feminine racegoers. Mrs.
F. W. Whyte (her husband is this year’s president)
hostessed a lunch party that included Mrs. C. H. Angas,
Mrs. R. E. H. Hope, and the wives of other Club
presidents, and the committee scattered a vast
number of invitations for afternoon tea, where the
Whytes again did the honors —she in grey with
fur at her throat and a knot of bright ribbon tucked
into her black velvet hat. On the same afternoon
the bowling season was declared duly open by the
Adelaide Oval Club, whereat Mrs. Lance Addison
smiled over the teacups. Garden-lovers have no
grumbles for the wet Spring. Everywhere there are
lawns of emerald green and velvet softness and
such roses as would make their grower’s fortunes
if they could be transported to London or N’York
shops.
Heather, eldest daughter of the A. J. McDonalds,
has engaged herself to Grant Matheson, of Nalpena
station. Through her mother she claims kin-
ship with the Murray clan, which means that she
is related to half the families of this State.
A steady trade is done at the Red Cross shop in

give the wounded Diggers’ enterprise her benediction
and promise new models to be copied when she
came back from her jaunt to London, whither she
sails in November, with his Ex. following in
February.

WOMAN'S
LETTER
SAY
Kayser
GIOVES
Every woman in Sydney who is educa-
tionally somebody jambed her hat on a bit
tighter if she were shingled, or skewered
it with another pin or two if she retained
a back knob, and hasted to the Women s
(’ollege one day last week. Here, in a cold
wind that ruffled everything but the tempers
of the devotees, Lady de Chair flung wide
the hall that commemorates Louisa Mac-
donald, first principal of the College, and
later on unveiled a Janies Quinn portrait of
the same pioneer of higher education for
women. Her Ex., who had passed some days
at the College when in Sydney 20 years ago,
made one of her happiest speeches, that was
to the mind as potpourri to the senses.
Indeed, the whole afternoon was fragrant
with memories.
Another Sydney school has the proud feel-
ing these days. Sydney High wall next year
have a new chief, the mathematical Saxby.
This will mean that botli Sydney Grammar
and Sydney High will have old Sydney High
boys as chiefs; and when the just-appointed
1 >r. Winston takes over his new job at the
Sydney Hospital, Sydney, Prince Alfred and
North Sydney' will all have Old Boys of the
same school as superintendents.
The Arts and Crafts show this year might
be a setting for Elroy Flecker’s “Hassan,”
so vividly does it bring the bazaars of “the
East” to one’s doorstep. Even the poet
sweet-seller would have revelled in the glow-
ing tapestries and scarves and the vivid
dyes of the cloths. There were fierce-looking
short swords such as Hiram of Tyre pro-
bably disembowelled a mutineer with; but
instead of being of Damascus steel they
turned out to be wooden, their purpose paper-
cutting. Rlioda Wager’s art jewellery rav-
ishes the eyes, and Mildred Creed’s spoons
would make medicine-taking a pleasure. The
painted china burns grass-green or ruby-red
against the mellowness of brass trays. There
is polished woodwork, and there are raffia
baskets luscious as fruits; and through all
the permeating smell of worked leather. Lady
de Chair blessed the show on Monday and
sped it on its way, standing up to the deed
in black-and-white frocking from which a
cape effect of black lace and marabout
flowed. With her was Mrs. Grant; and the
society’s president, Florence Sulman, did
the honors.
According to the girl just back from the
Clothes Orchard, women will have to glisten
like a goldfish or the tail-part of a mermaid
to be smart during the next dancing season.
The new just-below-thc-knee dance-frock is
gold-splashed, gold-embroidered or else
crusted with mother-o’-pearl. If your new
straight, sleeveless evening frock is not gold-
hued, it should be flesh-pink embroidered all
over, either with beads arranged in designs
like winter-bound leafless shrubs or in lead-
light effects. No draperies or sashes, anyway,
fur London, where they are dancing mad, and
nothing but the tiny intimate cabaret or
night club is popular. The Town Hall dur-
ing an Artists’ Ball would seem like an un-
populated area compared with some of these.
When the Sydney woman left there were no
new dances, and the waltz had refused to
be revived. The newest handbag is the Mon-
sieur Herriot, and is a reproduction of a
white French poodle whose little inside will
hold almost everything for a week-end ex-
cept your golfsticks. There is another hand-
bag—a rainbow-effect affair—to be carried
with tub frocks. It is made of colored cotton
crepe, and lined with strips of cloudy grey.
This is -the Kid Boot Bag.”
It isn’t often that you creep into a theatre
of a morning and realise that you are listen-
ing to a voice among hundreds. That’s
wbat happened last Thursday at the Palace,
when the corner-stones of musical Sydney
heard the coloratura songburst of Ethel
Sagassgr, from Bendigo. Ethel is an ambi-
tious, self-reliant young woman w r ho lias
been touring Australia with her own com-
pany, receiving everywhere good notices and
getting good houses. She ivas a pupil of
I.ucy Atkins, Melba’s protegee, wflio after-
wards married Melba’s nephew. Some con-
certs in Sydney will be followed by the in-
vasion of Maoriland and America.
Mrs. Pitt Rivers is taking a rest-cure
in St. Luke’s after the strenuous going of
the New Guinea jaunt. She can almost be
said to lie in a bed of roses these days—her
room is simply massed with the beauties. It
looks as though Maonland will have to post-
pone the joy of seeing the Governor-General s
daughter as a real actress. There was talk
some time ago of her starring m a group
of Milne comedies and repertory plays from
Auckland to the Bluff.
Phyllis Palmerston Wheatley, only daugh-
ter of the headmaster of Jervis Bay Naval
College, duly married Lieutenant Cyril
Arthur Boy Sadlier, of H.M.A.S. Brisbane,
in the College Chapel last week, and breathed
the necessary vows from the depths of two
veils —one of pale pink and the other ot
white tulle. Below this her attire was of
silk lace mounted on accordeon-pleated chit-
fons, the whole ballasted by a tram of beaded
silver tissue. Janet and Helen Harvey and
Frances Blaxland ’maided in a shimmer _ot
pale pinks and blues, enriched with Spanish
lace. There was an arch of steel, ancl mid-
dies to draw the bridal car an’ everything.
Bride’s mother had laid the wedding feast in
the College wardroom, where she hostessed m
cruiser-grey frocking and feathery millinery.
The chapel at the King’s School, Parra-
matta, provided the setting for the wedding
of one of its old boys the other afternoon.
Bridegroom was Norman Taylor, who grows
wool in Queensland and whose father sells
law in Sydney; and the bride was Merle
Cory Hunt, only daughter of the Hunts of
Warwick. Reverend Morgan Baker, head-
master at King’s, tied the knot. Gold bro-
cade formed the bridal raiment, and a family
heirloom in lace and an armful of yellow
roses gave the finishing touches. The toast
was given at the historic Woolpack, where
bride's mother hostessed in a garment of
black Spanish lace topped by black ospreyed
millinery. The honeymoon is to be spent
in Europe.
One night last week Jean Osborne Wil-
shire glittered up St. Stephen’s on father's
arm in ivory softness, with rhinestone em-
broideries, to keep tryst with John Kinross
of Inverell. A billowy tulle veil, orange-
buds and yellow roses were other ingredients
in the bridal finery; and three bridesmaids,
whose frocking was a souffle of skyey blue
and silver lace, finished off the color poem
with bouquets of deep red roses. Padre John
Ferguson blessed the vows and Neville Body
best-manned; and, later, family-friend Mrs.
McDougall hostessed a reception in the Went-
worth.
Popular Muriel East, of Rockdale, is
wearing a high-powered diamond circlet these
days. The hapny man who slipped it into
place was Dr. George Elliott, of Carlton.
Muriel has a singing voice of alluring quality,
and hands that can fashion anything artistic.
Her father is The Bulletin’s oldest inhabi-
tant : as a lad he helped to make its first
number.
Colonel Cox-Taylor had to say “Bless you,
my children,” again the other day. This
time it was to only son Noel and Heather
Cramsie —she is of Glen Innes. They con-
template matrimony in the near future.
From this photograph gaze the steadfast
eyes of Charlotte, widow of the poet Henry
Kendall. Last week, forty-odd years after
his death, she
was buried be-
neath the same
monument at
Waver ley. A
belle of the
early ’sixties
and a great
musician, Mrs.
Kendall r e-
tained to the
last that
vivacity and
brilliancy
which had
made her an
intimate of the
literary group
of her hus-
band’s time.
Gordon, Har-
pur, Marcus
Clarke, Brun-
ton Stephens,
Archibald.
Parkes, Barton—she knew them all and
had a fund of stories about them which to
the end she could tell in an inimitable man-
ner. But one likes best to think of her as
the pioneers of Kendall, on the North Coast,
recall her (her husband was then Inspector
of Forestry)—-a young, slim thing, riding,
fishing and boating with the poet, who was
then composing his “Songs from the Moun-
tains.” The lady, who was a daughter of
the Dr. Rutter famous in the ’sixties, in-
herited from her parent the gift of making
and keeping friends. One of the deepest
mourners at her funeral was Mrs. Eliza
Long, now 80-odd. who in the golden long
ago was Mrs. Kendall’s bridesmaid.
There’s a big Society push behind a
matinee for the Sydney Day Nurseries. It
is booked for November 18 at the Royal.
After that many of the helpers will begin to
thin'k in trunks, for there is to be another
great after-Christmas exodus to Europe. The
wise committee is enlisting the assistance of
professionals in the programme, with a side-
line of tableaux for our best buds to blossom
in. At one memorable concert given by
Society amateurs last year some of the per-
formers repeated the numbers they had sung
and danced at a show three years before.
Capable Mrs. W. P. McElhone is president
of the Day Nurseries matinee; and the
equally capable A. E. Hughes and. Stuart
Macphail matrons are the secretaries.
At the general meeting called with the
intention of forming a committee to work
up public interest in the picture-show for
the Limbless Soldiers, Mrs. George Vivers
presided in place’of Lady de. Chair, who
was unable to be present. Bertie Kelly and
Commodore Wardle gave a helping hand,
and the facts and figures were read by
soldier-secretary Owen. The pictures are
unique and will be shown for seven days at
the Town Hall, and as the initial expenses
are high everybody is asked to give a hand.
A ball on Armistice Night will beckon the
vice-regals, the Navy and the Army to the
Palais Royal.
This is Lynda Paul, an Orange girl—that’s
her birthplace, not the color of her politics—
who is a reincarnation of the hand-printing
and boo k-
ilium mating
monks of old.
She can copy
any sort o f
script, and is
ca p a ble of
f o r g i n g Tu-
t a n k hamen’s
signature i f
any modern
wants to send
a brickbat in
his name. Some
exquisite speci-
mens of her
work have been
on view in the
loan exhibition
for the Caril-
lon Fund; a
whole book of
poems, h an d-
printed and
decorated by .....
her, was one of the most fascinating things
in the show. The- more intricate the letter-
ing the better she likes it. And the curious
part is she has never studied drawing and
doesn’t know whether the script she is using
is Roman or Double Dutch; but following
some innate law of righteousness she never
mixes her lettering. She is already widely
known among connoisseurs who want “some-
thing different” on their book shelves.
The Sacred Heart Hospice again sends
out a call. Will you help to make a
dance at the Wentworth on November IS
a great success? And after that will you
take the children to a big Christmas-tree
at the same address —it’s to be early in De-
cember? Both efforts are in aid of the admir-
able Darlinghurst institution.
If marble were substituted for the tier
upon tier of concrete, the new Star of the
East headquarters at Balmoral might be
mistaken for a temple of ancient Greece.
From the level of the beach flights of steps
lead past the floors where such mundane
things as the swastika cushions are housed:
for even a Star-of-tlie-Easter is human and
concrete is cold. ' Then the amphitheatre
proper is reached. This is almost semi-
circular, and. rises tier upon tier till, it
tops the hill at its back. At a little dis-
tance it has all the effect of having been
hewn out of granite. On a level with the
low r est tier of seats is the shallow altar or
stage. This is pure Greek, its pillars lonian,
its natural backcloth the sublime North
Head which stretches an arresting arm be-
tween the Pacific and Balmoral Bay. In
this ideal open-air theatre a play is to be
produced next month by Ethel Eorimer and
her pupils. She had picked on one of Frois-
sart; but Dr. Mary Rocke* who is a big
chief in the church movement, says “No
play, be it ever so classic, can be produced
in the ampitheatre if the plot harbors a
courtesan.” So the players are now rehears-
ing “The Other Wise Man,” from a novel
by Van Dycke. Allan Wilkie was out the
other day, and is thinking of producing “The
Tempest” and some pastoral plays in the
ideal surroundings.
Last week the Made-in-Australia Prefer-
ence League, continuing its good work, led
Minister for Education Bruntnell and a
group of Country’Press Conference delegates
to the wilds of Anpandale, where the piano-
making Beales showed how an Australian
musical instrument is made. The output
of the factory is now over 3000 yearly, and
Scott Fell, who was the loud speaker of
the party, said he hoped they would soon be
producing 10,000. Quite right, of course.
But, all the same, it’s plain Scott Fell doesn’t
live in a flat.
Mrs. England, back in Sydney after leav-
ing the first C.W.A. ambulance at Nyngan,
has a story that would fill a day and a night
of her tour through the western towns.
Everywhere the ambulance was received with
cheers, and everywhere the fatted sheep was
basted and served to the visiting lady, with
red, red roses. One of, her resting places was
Canonbar —the Goldsbrough-Mort station
that was gilded and marcelled for the
Prince’s visit. The suite was put at the
traveller’s disposal—electric lighting, beauti-
ful baths; everything but the Prince.
A group of Lily Juncker’s friends met at
the Australia to tell the clever pianist how
glad her own bit of Australia is to see her
home again. Lily sat behind a monster
bouquet, in a sleeveless Worth gown of
black, heavy with bead embroideries, and
her hat was the last word in feathers and
dimensions. Study with Matthay was her
chief occupation while abroad. Mrs. Annie
Perry made a charming welcome-home speech ;
and Mrs. Harrie Vale looked handsome in a
Paris model the shade of lager and buttoned
to the last word.
When Caroline Sharp passed over the other
day a very accomplished Braille expert and
an unselfish worker for the blind went hence.
A sister of the well-known musician, she
was superintendent and teacher of the blind
at the Deaf and Dumb Institution in Sydney
for many years, afterwards transferring to
Brisbane in the same capacity.
Iris de Cairos Rego’s piano and Eliso
Steele’s violin kept Rita Kirkpatrick's
soprano company at the Con. on Friday
night. It was really Rita’s show, with Iris
and Elise billed as assisting artists. Rita's
voice was at its best in the arias from
“Bolihme” and “Tosca.” The artistic Iris
was brilliant without being hard, and Elise
Steele’s music was of a golden smoothness.
That tireless twain who write as one,
Neville .Toske and Margot Goyder, have had
a new book published by Hodder and Stough-
ton. It is named “Safety First,” and is a
thistledown bit of madness. But the Sydney
sisters look like making money by it, as
a big firm of American publishers has also
taken it up.
The Allan Wilkie Shakspearean players
are booked to give three open-air perform-
ances in the grounds of the Girls’ High
School, Moore Park. “As You Like It,”
“Midsummer Night’s Dream” and “The
Tempest” are the pastorals chosen, and
November 15, 17 and IS the dates. The gate-
money will go to Prince Alfred’s.
A P.S. from Brisbane: —
Sir Matthew has returned from his bird-hunt up
north, and has been giving parties at Government
House. Red lilies, red cannas and deep red carna-
tions decorated the dancing-room for a shivoo
on the 21st, and roses filled the supper-room. Jack
Turner and H. M. Saunders helped Sir Matthew to
entertain, and among the handsome gowners were
Mrs. George Nathan, in black and gold brocade;
Mrs. H. 0. Mort, in her wedding-dress of ivory tulle
and satin; and Elizabeth Dods, in pink and blue
striped taffetas.
The social service scheme of All Saints’ got a
nice financial fillip from the cabaret arranged by
Mary Cameron at the South Brisbane City Hall.
Josie Melville slipped across from “Sally,” at llis
Majesty’s, to warble “Look for the Silver Lining’’ ;
and “The Wages of Sin” company, at the Royal, con-
tributed Gracie Savieri, Robert Purdie and Conway.
Bridge and Mali Jongg were features of Mrs. Leonard
Turner’s party at Montpelier, amid sweet-scented
carnations. Black marocain, with touches of grey
sheathed the hostess. Mrs. George Nathan, daughter
Pamela and Mrs. Ted Theodore (whose husband) has
just had to undergo an operation on his ear) were
amongst the pack shufflers.
Mrs. George Nathan, who has come from China
to visit her brother-in-law at Government House, and
Mrs. Turner were guests of honor at the Women’s
Club for the welcoming back of Martha Burns, Mrs.
Matthew Goggs and K. Baynes. Martha Burns gave
a graphic account of her jaunt, painting alluring
pictures of Nikko, Pekin and Hong Kong.
An “auction of girls” was announced in connection
with an appeal for funds for Market-square, and a
vast crowd assembled with anticipations of something
just a little bit queer, you know. The sky-pilots
arose in their wrath in the city pulpits, however,
and the fixture was postponed. What was really
intended by the “auction” nobody knows.
Southport roused itself to help along the Queens-
land Ambulance with a fancy-dress ball in the
School of Arts. Palms, gay paper lanterns and
sportive butterflies adorned the hall. “Dad” and
“Mum” were among the prize-winners.
At St. Stephen’s on Sunday Ethel Osborn sang
Gounod’s “Ave Maria,” and also soloed at the Ann-
street Presbyterian Church in the evening—a
gold watch was clasped to her wrist after the
service. On Monday she left for Sydney, carrying
her sheaves with her.
A big crowd trundled to tne races on Saturday.
Mrs. Stuart Tait sported almond-green, Irma Dear-
den was in cinnamon and cherry-red, Mrs. Ewald
Gross in black, Mrs. Tyrwhitte black and green.
Other's on the lawn were the Cadell Garricks, Wallis
Hoares, Covedales and Blumes.
“Honey” Thompson, daughter of the Brisbane eye-
man, has promised her fair young hand to Neil Jack-
son, younger son of E. S. Jackson, another Brisbane
medico. Pretty Honey’s mother was formerly Mabel
Hodgkinson, whose father’s name is written so often
in Bananaland' history.
Roses and gerberas decked the Golf Club-house
for the dinner dance of the R.Q.G.’s after the mixed
foursomes. Fireworks brightened things up.
Brisbane orphans and poor children had the day
of their lives when some 1300 of them from 21
homes, kindergartens and missions were conveyed
to Sandgate in 275 cars, supplied by members of
the Automobile Club. The line, when standing,
covered over a mile, and Brisbane believes it was xhe
biggest roll-up of tin Lizzies yet seen in Australia.

NOTIONS
“ON TOP” WITH
MICK SIMMONS
SURE CATCH TACKLE
After last works Bulletin went to press
r' e -n V ;, R ’ o ’ stipendiary stewards—W. H. Johnston,
‘' T - Gre ™ and Dr. Heslop, with R. H. Frew to help
tnom took a hand in the Purser argument oy
•nquinng into the horse’s running in the VATC
Coongy Handicap. In that race the Sea Prince
gelding started at 20 to 1 and ran accordinglv,
whereas in the Caulfield Cup, three davs later af'Ur
T" f L a ’ lnounced as an ™likely starter and quoted
ir 3 ? 1 > ho was . backed for a fortune down to
10 to 1 (The Monk, his stable companion and alleged
stable fancy, having been scratched on the course)
and won on the bit. Deciding that the noble animal
Ft n t been allowed to do his best in the Coongy,
the stewards disqualified him for 12 months and in-
cluded in the sentence J. R. Cort.een and George
Tye, the owners; C. T. Godby, the trainer; and it.
the jockey. The accused appealed to the
V.R.C. committee, who met on Monday and, after
considering a volume of evidence for the defence
decided that the disqualifications should stand This
means, among other things, that Heroic will Aot bo
able to start in the Derby or the Cup, nor can he
be nominated for the 1925 Cup unless he changes
hands. It means also that those who backed him for
either of the races for which he ruled as favorite until
the thunderbolt fell, insiders and mugs alike, will
lose their money. The stewards are to be con-
gratulated on doing their duty, as they saw it, and
the committee on backing up their officials, regardless
of the effect of their decision on the pockets of ante-
post punters and on the attractiveness of the Spring
meeting. Their resolute stand will do a power of
good. It is to be hoped that the committee will go
further and refuse the nominations of “battlers ”
bookmakers, ex-tote-shopkeepers, s.p. merchants and
the like, and renew their attempt to get the totalisa-
tor established in Victoria. Perhaps they are not
ready for such a reform as interdicting the publica-
tion of handicaps until 11 o’clock on the morning
of a race-day would be, but if they took that step
they would do their country a good turn.
With Heroic out of the wav, the V.R.C.
Derby looks merely a matter of Spearfelt’s retaining
his condition and being decently ridden. And if he
doesn’t go off in the meantime, or if the jockey
doesn’t let him down, the colt will take no end of
beating in the Cup. Generally speaking, there is no
better proposition for the great two-miler than a
good staving three-year-old, and Spearfelt has given
proofs of quality, gameness and stamina. In the
Rosehill Cup on September 20, with 1 41b. more than
his Flemington weight, 7st. 51b. (it will be 7st. 61b.
if he wins on Saturday), he was a close third to
Polvcletan and Purser, after striking all the bad
luck imaginable, and was finishing faster than either.
He was another close third in the A.J.O. Derby, and,
fls the race was run, he would probablv have been
first had his rider been of some assistance to him over
the last furlong. There is stout Carbine blood in
Spearfelt, _ and he looks a Cup horse every inch.
Others with unquestionable chances are the well-
tried four-year-olds, Stand By, Lilypond, Drongo and
1* ranees Tressady, who will all carry considerably
less than weight-for-age, and if Lilvpond hasn't gone
off he may prove the best of the bunch. The Westra-
lian is one of the few horses in the race that have
ir 0 ? ?" wo m des, ar >d Feathernest’s fourth in the
Aletropolitan and second in the Caulfield Cup show
that the Lilyveil gelding’s Perth Cup form was
good. But this page expects Spearfelt to win both
Derby and Cup.
“H. Hardupp”: All going well, Bobby Lewis will
make a great effort on Saturday to beat Tommy
Hales’s record of riding seven V.R.C. Derby winners.
Bobby, who must be 50 if he is a day, has the
mount on Versine. He scored his first Derby win on
Malster in 1900, the other six being Hautvillers
(1901), Sylvanite (1904), Alawa (1908), Wolowa
(1912), Carlita (1914), and Furious (1921). Inci-
dentally, a Versine victory would give E. E. D.
Clarke his third blue riband. He owned Wolowa
and Furious.
“B.B.”; The Godbys, Cecil, Charlie and Norman,
are natives of Armidnle (N.S.W.). Their father was
Harry Godbv, one-time editor of the Armidale
Ciironiclk ; he married Doll.v Oliver, daughter of the
district surveyor. Harry’s father was an archdeacon,
rather distinguished in his day, and he, in turn, was
a son of Admiral Godby, who, so runs the story, was
one of Nelson's favorite captains. When Harry
Godby died there was poverty in the little home,
and his widow opened a milliner’s shop in Armidale.
Cecil and Charlie determined to become jockeys, and
found in Dick Wootton an excellent mentor and a
generous patron. When old enough, Norman followed
them to Sydney. Their careers since have been of
unbroken success, and their banking accounts are
solid. It is to their credit that the best they could
procure was never considered good enough for their
mother.
Stand By has done very well since he came
from South Aus. and went into Scobie’s stable, and,
with Lewis aboard, punters rushed to take threes
about him in the very good field that ran for the
£l7OO Moonee Valley Cup. Bobby didn’t bustle
his mount in the first furlong, but the Lanius —
Comedietta, horse was in a handy position with
seven furlongs to go, and his black head was
showing in front at tho turn. There the race was
over, but Lewis was content with half a length’s
advantage at the finish, Acearak being second and
Wallaralc, who w r as running on, third. It was an
impressive display, considering that the black horse
beat, off two representative performers in Acearak
and Easingwold without difficulty, and occupied
only 2min. 27see. for the 114 furlongs on a dead
track, and he immediately became a short-priced
favorite for the Melbourne Cup. He escapes a
penalty for the two-miler, in which he has Bst.
81b.—411). less than on Saturday. Good money came
for Feathernest (6’s) and Polvcletan (B’s) but
both galloped disappointingly. Dempsey rode Wal-
larak, who was a good way back at the turn, and
there was a bit of chaffing at his expense in the
jockeys’ room. For he it was who said, in explana-
tion of Stand By’s defeat in the Adelaide Cup,
that the hope of South Oss. was an over-rated horse.
Young was given the* mount on The Night Patrol
in the IV. S. Cox Plate, and the Maoriland jockey’s
magic touch —-or phenomenal luck—was in evidence
again. AVhittier was a 5-to-4 favorite with The.
Night, Patrol pressing him closely, until backing for
Lilypond caused both to ease, one to 6 to 4 and
the English stallion to 7 to 2. Leading all the
way, the imported horse beat Whittier just as
decisively as Claro beat him at Randwick last
April, and there is no gainsaying the fact that
English form is much superior to Australian, up
to 10 furlongs at any rate. The Night Patrol
galloped the 91- furlongs in lmin. 59-}sec. without
being fully extended. He is owned by Gov. Strad-
broke, and great was the cheering when his number
went up. The aged son of Steadfast—Dark Flight
has Bst. 101 b. in the Cup, but he has never won
beyond the Cox Plate distance, albeit he ran
second in the 12-furlong Doncaster Stakes as a
three-year-old, and the chances are that he will be
reserved for w.f.a. races against Gloaming, whom
he will probably down. Demades ran a decent race
for a colt used to galloping in welter company;
though two lengths behind Whittier he was clear
of The Hawk and Lilypond. Another to perform
creditably was Frances Tressady. Last into the
straight, she ended up fifth. She has Bst. 41b. in
the Melbourne Cup, and considering her respectable
performances last year—first in the V.R.C. Derby,
CORTEEN, TYE and COBBY, sketched
before the earthquake.
fifth in the Cup, fourth in the Australian Cup,
second in the A.J.C. Leger, and first in the 13-
furlongs City Handicap, beating The Cypher a
pretty good horse that day—she would be a fair
Tote bet if there were a machine handy, although
she may not be quite brilliant enough to win.
* * *
“Quiz” : Is the owner of any horse in the
Melbourne Cup as sure of victory as was the late
John Mayo that Lord Cardigan would win in 1!>03 ?
A few minutes before the start Mayo wrote a telegram
addressed to a near relative in Randwiek, stating
simply “The colt won,” his object being to ensure
its immediate despatch after the race. Barely had
Lord Cardigan flashed first past the judge when
Mayo breathlessly handed the message to the receiving
official.

“H. ITardupp”: A well-known Melbourne
sportsman, whose lead is watched and followed on
the course, has a yarn ,to tell of Caulfield Cup day.
He was approached ‘ for a tip on the last race by an
agitated man who said that he had had a bad time
and wanted to get square. “I know nothing,” said
the big man, but the agitated person refused to take
“No” for an answer. He was so persistent in his
attentions that the other rapped out an impatient
“Oil, back King Pan,” and turned away. To the
sportsman’s office on Monday morning a box of
excellent cigars and a gold cigar-case were brought
by a man who was profuse in his gratitude. “If
HIS LUCKY DAY.
JACK: “A bloke’s picked me pocket, and took
the little I had left.”
MOSES: “VOT a lucky fellow you are you
didn’t vin a boultice on the last race!”
King Pan hadn’t won,” he explained, with emotion,
1 would have been short in my cash, and then I
would have done myself in.” It startled the sports-
man to know that a mere careless chance suggestion
should have meant so much; but the believer in his
acumen insisted on regarding him as a white-souled
benefactor in spite of his own depreciation of the
tip—which, by the way, he didn’t back himself.
The Wild Goose is made of much more
durable stuff than, most of the English horses that
have come this way. Four or five races have been
enough for numerous importations, and too many
for some; but the grey son of Royal Canopy—Wagtail
has been at it every month since March, and he has
had few idle Saturdays during the last quarter.
There was a notion at Canterbury Park that he
had grown weary of the business, and for that reason
Sardine was preferred to him for the 11-furlongs’
handicap at a difference of 201 b., but Orrell took
the solid grey to the front early, slowed the field
down, and landed him a nice winner from Irish
Flower and the favorite, who started at 3’s; the
(loose was half a point longer. Picardy broke a
leg when going well, and had ’to bd destroyed. He
earned his oats in Queensland last year, but Mat-
thews, the Randwick bookie, found him a horrible
disappointment, as he did Royal Howard and All
Gold. Followers of Bartle must have had a good
day, for the industrious lad rode five winners—
Curban (evens), Coleus (6 to 4), Torbellino (10’s),
Melia (9 to 2) and Nygee (5 to 2). But Bartle
hasn’t many followers. He is not one of the fashion-
able jockeys, although he is bidding for a place
among them.
“P. Pawnticket”: The latest Melbourne
golf story concerns a parson who has only lately
taken to the game. He was matched with a player
possessing a reputation rather for his language than
his ability on the putting green. The event created
a great deal of interest, but there was disappointment
in the clubhouse when it was found that there was
no breach between the two; on the contrary, they
came back rare good friends. ‘‘His language!”
echoed the parson, when the question was directly
put to him. “Oh, yes ; I noticed it. But then, golf
is a very, er—difficult game for a clergyman to
play. I found it very convenient, when Mr. Brassie
rose to the height of his—er, argument, as it were,
to, er—say ‘Heah, heah.’ ”

The ancient Waddy retained his heavy-
weight title after a strenuous 20 rounds with Albert
Lloyd. Staged in the Exhibition Building, the match
brought the largest crowd Adelaide has ever seen at
a fight; there were 4000 in the house at 155., 10s.,
55., 3s. and 25., plus taxes. Very different from the
Saturday “gate” nowadays at the Sydney Stadium,
where, thanks to the idiotic i method's of the Wren
syndicate, the game has gone from bad to worse.
Waddy and Lloyd are old opponents. Too old, in a
sense, but there are no good young heavyweights
coming on.
* * * #
The Yarra was a swollen stream on
Saturday, as a result of recent rain, and a strong
ebb tide contributed to the breaking of many records.
The Maiden Eights went to University No. 1 in time
which was a whole 15sec. faster than Albert Park
had set up in 1920. Richmond were level 120
yards from home, but Uni. just got there in a
ding-dong - finish. In the Grand Challenge Cup, the
other University crew, stroked by R. L. lyeon-Cohen,
who is having an impressive run of successes, beat
Mercantile by a length and a quarter, the time
(4min. 52sec.) being 16sec better than Merc.’s previ-
ous best, established in 1920. In the Yarra Chal-
lenge Cup, for scullers, a record made in 1912 by
Ted Kirby went by the board when J. Barton,
of Richmond, comfortably defeated Cambridge, of
Sandhurst, in smin. 38sec. Mercantile accounted
for Essendon in the Stewards’ Challenge Cup; and
the Maiden Pours were easy for the Tamar crew
from the Speck. A bright feature of the
was the way in which the officials kept to the
time-table. Secretary Kenny is a stickler for punctu-
ality, and the rule that provides for a penalty of
£2 or disqualification in the case of competitors
who are not at their posts when they should be
might be advantageously copied in other sports—and
enforced, as it is at Henley.
“Hamer”: One of the Henley spectators started his
travels on the vinous track early on Saturday morn-
ing, and, getting outside the wire fence, went to
sleep on the sloping bank. Probably he travelled
the world whilst he slumbered, but the cheers of
the crowd as University forged ahead in the Maiden
bights \yoke him up. “Hooray!” he yelled, stagger-
ing to his feet. “Who won ?” A bystander informed
him that University had the victory. “Damn it!”
he cried, “I know that! But which university—
Oxford or Cambridge?” Then he fell into the
iarra, and was fished out and left on a lighter to dry.
Henley-on-the-Leiehhardt-Canal is not yet as big
an affair as the one on the Yarra, which is 18
years older, but it is growing. It is estimated that
16,000 Sydneyites saw it on Saturday. As antici-
pated, Mosman, stroked bv C. B. Callaghan, were
too strong for University in the Senior Challenge
Eights, but Uni.’s junior crew reversed positions in
the Maiden Eights. S. Pye, of Leichhardt, was
1J length ahead of W. Robertson at the finish of
the Challenge Sculls, but he had lOsec. start. Now
that Bull has retired, Robertson must be accounted
the State’s best amateur sculler. The two Cran-
brook crews were first and second in the School
Fours. This college is battling hard for a place in
the G.P.S. regatta, and on its showing against
boats from King’s School and St. Joseph’s College,
it is certainly entitled to inclusion next year.
*** ‘ *
“Rubicon”: The distribution of Melbourne
University blues, referred to by “O. McKay M.” (B.
23/10/’24), has left the majority of undergrads pros
trate. The equality, from a blue standpoint, of
cricket and rifle-shooting and of rowing and hockey
is questionable—at all events the Melbourne Uni.
authorities differ on this point from those at Oxford.
Actually II football blues were awarded to a wiii-
ning XVIII, and seven cricket blues to a winning
XI, while a losing rifle team gathers in six for its
eight members. I can see no justification for this
exaltation of rifle-shooting, a pastime which demands
no physical qualities beyond good eyes and a good
finger or so, nor any mental ones beyond patience—
and, the same might be said of “Aunt Sallv.”
* * * '*
Arthur Spencer (15st. and mud-fat), Ray
Eaton and Mario Antenucci, from abroad, and George
Dempsey, Wally Coppins and Gerald Halpin were
among the competitors on the Sydney Sports
Ground when the professional-cycling season began.
Halpin collected most cash during 1 the evening. He
was the Australian cycling rep. at Antwerp in 1920,
as Coppins and Dempsey were at Paris this vear. The
next Olympic committee will have to consider whether
it is worth while paying the considerable expenses of
bike-pushers, who are so apt to turn professionals and,
in the case of Dempsey and Coppins, to whine bit-
terly that the allowances they received abroad were
not as royal as they expected.
* * * *
“.T,qeky Roo”: The All Rlacks arc still
knocking spots off English fifteens; Cumberland
went down by 41 to nil. But the , Maorilanders are
due for a. struggle next month when they meet
teams from Oxford and Cambridge. The Daft
Blues should extend them, as there are seven inter-
national three-quarters available, including our own
A. C. Wallace and Dr. R. L. Raymond. Oxford is
still using Raymond as a full-back, which is a
mistake. As a winger the man has few equals, and
I can never see the wisdom of turning a naturallv
attacking player, into a defensive one. But English
Rugby selectors are notoriously pig-headed in this
respect.
* * * *
“Paemako”: On a recent Saturday Reg
Collier, crack wing-threequarter of the Taihape
(M.L.) team, found himself unable to catch the
train with the balance of the team for Ohakune,
where they were to play a match against Ruapehu.
Loth to let side down, he saddled his horse and
rode the 25 miles to ’lCune, arriving 20 minutes
before the game was to commence. He scored and
converted Taihape’s first three tries, and converted the
other try registered, thus compiling 17 of the 20 points
b Y .® e team—it won 20—6. After the match
Collier joined the boys at the smoke concert, and
when the rest had left for the railway station, he
set off on horseback again for his solitary ride
home. , wo, d<i have possibly gained a place with
the All Blacks had it not been for a war injury to
Ins leg, which sometimes lays him lip.

“S.T.S.”: Curious how little it. takes to
convict a writer of ignorance of his subject, when
that subject is sport. D. H. Lawrence, in his new
Westralian novel, “The Boy in the Bush” (a title
'’“'■rowed’ perhaps unknowingly, from another visitor
of the long-ago, Henry Kingsley), makes the hero
render an account of his athletic experiences. At
school he had been captain of the “first” football
team, which is the way a maiden aunt might put it.
but no man ever would ; also, he had been considered
‘ not bad in front of the sticks,” whatever that may
mean. Later, this youth took part in a Westralian
cricket match, and was out in a remarkable way:
“a terrific full pitch came down crash over his head
on to the middle wicket”—one wonders just where he
was standing. The very man who bowled it “stumped
him. out in the second innings,” which is just
possible, but not likely. No wonder they had “eight
men out for 26 rounds.” This last might be the
printer’s fault; but after the others, one feels dubious.
* * * •
“G.0.R.”: The great fault of the Vic-
torian . selectors is their weakness for finding
places.in their teams for cricketers with a past, while
they ignore, the claims of players with a future.
Witness their repeated selection of Ransford after
his form was gone, and their prolonged blindness to
Ponsford’s ability. And now they have chosen the
43-year-old Frank Tarrant, who has been out of the
game since 1914, to play against South Oss., coming
to this decision when his only recent performance
was a stodgy 40. With bowlers so scarce, it was
surely their duty to give one of the youngsters
a trial. Rayson, Sindrey and Ebeling are consistent
colts, and Gamble is always good and occasionally
unplayable. Surely the selection of one of these
boys would be better policy, and his success, if he
came off, would reflect greater glory on Victoria
than the triumph of a veteran who played most of
his cricket abroad.

[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
Dr. Ferguson (M.L.) pointed out at the American
congress of Surgeons that the human eyes were not
meant for reading, but were intended for use in
jungles, looking out for wild animals and searching
for food. Reading was responsible for most modern
eye troubles.”

Barring for the sporting papers, Miller’s, and, of

Little else 1 put my eyes to. And the reasons now

Hear the doc! Our orbs for ages never pored o’er

There I lurk, alert for danger, there I prowl to

Figures others’ brains may addle. Just the numbers

No binoculars’ assistance I require at any distance
To acquaint me where the tartan or the blue-and-

Bill the Bos'n turned liis quid.
“If I could spin a tale,
I’d tell you what that Dago did
Off Flattery in a, gale,
When the tops’l pulled out all his teeth,
Which is monkey tricks, I say,
And he fell on a coaming underneath
And we sank him deep next day.
If I could tell a tale,’’ said Bill,
And he shook his head and chewed on still.
Tales ? ’ said the tough old engineer.
“If I’d ha’ learned to write,
I’d tell you the story, true and queer,
How we lost our chief one night;
And when we blew the boiler down
We found his blackened bones.
He’d treated Chinks as dogs to drown
And the yellow gang ain’t stones.
But T can’t write and I can’t talk.”
And he rolled along on his morning walk.
“Here were we and there she lay”—
The coastguard’s thumb-nail drew
A near-beer chart of a fateful day
When the bootleg craft got through—
“ And six' w r ere killed in that merry fight
And we lost the cargo, too.
Oh ! I can’t talk and I can’t write,
Or I’d spin the yarn for you.
It’s a merry game we play,” said he—
“ To-day it’s them, to-morrow it’s we.”
The poet’s pencil and paper lay
Idle before his eyes.
He’d tried to write true verse all day,
But his fancies would not rise.
The stale old scenes had tired h-is head
The same old rhyming tricks.
“I’d like to be down by the sea,” he said,
“Where the roughnecks meet and mix.
I’ve written the longshore stuff right out;
’Tis the sea that I want to write about.”

CONTROLLING
GAS UNDER PRESSURE
ALL industrial gases, such as Oxygen, Acetylene, Coal Gas, etc., when
under pressure need to be fully controlled. Control is only possible
with a Pressure Regulator which is absolutely reliable for accuracy, has
the minimum of working parts and at the same time is extremely sensitive.
That such a regulator can be obtained
entirely Australian in design and manu-
facture is something to be proud of.
Comox Endurance Pressure Regulators
are as serviceacle as they are sensitive.
They are fitted with safety valves of
ample capacity and also Comox Pressure
Gauges the most efficient type that is
obtainable. Two types of Comox Regu-
lators are supplied for Oxygen.
Standard Regulators for Acetylene, Coal
Gas, Air, Hydrogen or Carbonic Acid.
Prices are moderate and will be supplied
on request.

The audience which rolled up at Sydney
Grand Opera House on Saturday to see
“The O’Brien Girl” renew her burglarious
entry into the circles of high snobbery had
evidently all attended before, and were ready
with their applause before the jokes were
half out of the speakers’ mouths. Mamie
Watson, as the adventurous stenographer who
steals a husband, displayed a well-moulded
form and face and an equally well-moulded
voice to the susceptible eyes of Leyland Hodg-
son, who broke all conventions by falling in
love with her. There was a lot of extraneous
Red Indian and much flourishing of toma-
hawks and a canoe upset off stage which this
Sundry Showman failed to fit into the general
scheme; but the measured dancing of Hazel
Harris and Westley Pierce Avas a rest cure
for dazzled eyes, and was good enough to
fit into anything. Mark Daly and Belle
Bellchambers, as Mr. and Mrs. Drexel, inter-
preted the domestic drama in terms of the
suburban fowlyard in their inimitable Dance
of the Henpecked Husband; and .Tune
Roberts exploited a N’Yoik accent with effect.
The chorus has restored public confidence in
the destiny of the feminine figure by bringing
the waistline back to normal —with the curi-
ous result, however, that they all look shorter
by several inches.
*
“The Tempest,” presented by the Wilkie
Co. at Sydney Palace, is a scathing indict-
ment of modern methods of dealing with
native races, and when Shakspeare wrote it
he must have had his bright prophetic eye
on a recent controversy on the subject be-
tween Cant. Pitt Rivers and the Rev. J. G.
Wheen. The scene of the play is a romantic
tropical island, and the time, judging by the

amount of weather about, is the beginning
of the wet monsoon. When Prospero, the
exiled Duke of Milan, arrives with his.
daughter on this unspoiled paradise, he finds
it in the possession of Caliban, an uncouth
but, according to his lights, capable savage.
Prospero, using book-learned magic, proceeds
to subjugate the unsophisticated creature,
whose own primitive sorceries are impotent
against him. He punishes his revolt by re-
ducing him to the status of a slave. (“Any
native who practises or pretends to practise
sorcery shall be liable to imprisonment for
any period not exceeding”—Commonwealth
Government Native Ordinance, section 72.)
Prospero is followed in due course by those
other standard-bearers of civilisation, Trin-
culo and Stephano, who are thrown upon the
island in company with a hogshead of grog.
'Caliban falls down and worships them as
new gods, possibly more powerful than his
master, and is rewarded with draughts of
the celestial liquor contained in the hogs-
head. They plan to murder Prospero. Pros-
pero discovers the plot and administers more
punishment to Caliban, who, having had his
own gods taken from him and been de-
bauched and exploited by the new ones, loses
interest in life and sinks to the condition
of a spiritless Avorm to Avliom anyone is at
liberty to apply liis foot.
* * # *
The final stage, which the playwright
leaves to the imagination, is racial extermina-
tion. This is really the Aital problem of the
Avhole, and the transparent manoeuvres of
Prospero to get a wealthy husband for his
daughter, the flaccid love-making of Miranda
and Ferdinand (unconvincingly portrayed by
Miss Hunter-Watts and Ellis Irving), and
the slioddv intriguing of the shipwrecked
noblemen only serve as foils for it. It
a pity Allan Wilkie failed to emphasise the
nobler attributes of the natural man in
Caliban, with his love of music and of
the woods; they make him a pleasanter per-
son, on the whole, than the treacherous
Antonio or the sottish Stephano.
Australian manufacturers ought to turn
eagerly to the N.S.W. Society of Arts and
Crafts exhibition at the Education Gallery
in Sydney. The goods on show are, at any
rate, the germ of a national culture which
in these days of mass-production can only
be made generally accessible with the aid
of factory machinery. Such delightful things
as the native-bear vase of Vi Eyre, the big,
strongly-designed frilled-lizard vase of E. P.
Finlay, the casserole dish and the flannel-
flower brooch of A. I. Newman and the gum-
leaf tea set of J. Warburton illustrate the
decorative possibilities latent in the flora and
fauna of this land. If but one of our cap-
tains of industry would seize his imagination
in both hands and substitute; some of these
gumtrees and kookaburras for the tired old
willoAv pattern on his cups and saucers he
would do a great service to the Common-
Aveal; suburban homes, stuffed as they are
Avith the rubbish of alien bazaars from
Petersham to Peking, might begin to open
their doors to the quaint and beautiful em-
blems of the bush. The Japanese can show as
a lead in this: the commonest utensil is not
too mean to have art lavished on it; and
it is as easy to reproduce a beautiful teapot
or a decorative spittoon as an ugly one.

Some of the embroidery of Bertha Max-
well has been purchased by the National Art
Gallery. An interesting exhibit is the gay
and effecti\ 7 e hand-painted furniture designed
by Byram Mansell, but the society would be
wise to hurry out of sight the inaccurate and
ungrammatical notice which decorates the
same gentleman’s display of Javanese batik
work. The complacent statement that this
art has only just been “revived” in America
and France, and that “those countries have
done much to improve on the native method,
also in color and design,” left this Showman
breathless. Anyone who knows the sober
taste in color and rhythmical beauty of de-
sign in the traditional patterns of real batik
(still being executed in a thousand villages
in Java) will find the imitations here dis-
played. clever as they are, altogether crude
and shocking.
“The year’s at the spring,”
The day’s at the end,
The night comes apace,
And Avhere would you go—Avliere?
The play is the thing,
If one might recommend,
And the Royal the place

Five more nights will terminate the John
D. O’Hara season at Sydney Cri. and bring

And merry maids “Whirled into Happiness”?
Then hit the evening breeze
For where the frivolling of Alfred Frith
And Willie Collins make dull care a myth—•
At Sydney Majesty’s.
With a couple of minor exceptions, the
Sydney Tivoli bill remains unchanged. Harry
Weldon is still making humorous comments
oil the vicissitudes of a bullfighter’s existence,
and his boxing turn puts anything the
Stadium can offer into the shade.

Sydney Lyceum is the temporary abode
of “Babbitt,” Sinclair Lewis’s dull and portly
suburbanite, who takes a night ride with a
manicurist and then goes home to his wife
and forgiveness: “The Lone Wolf” is prowl-
ing about the Lyric’s silver sheet. The ani-
mal is none other than Jack Holt as a crib-
cracker w-lio doesn’t believe in sharing his
loot with others. At the Strand a love-
crazy college student is hanging his hat up
to a cabaret dancer, and they call it “Daring
Years.” “Strangers of the Night” are mak-
ing the pace at the Globe, and a bored young
man who cries aloud for excitement receives
the goods by quick despatch. The Crystal
Palace is whispering about “A Society Scan-
dal,” and on the same bill “The Bowery
Bishop” is a parson who does his one kind
deed a day and more in the slums. The Em-
press is screening “Western Luck,” and flut-
tering at Hoyt’s is “The White Moth,” a
giddy little lady with theatrical connections
and a magnetism that millionaires find them-
selves unable to resist.
. Something better in its class than any
Melbourne audience had been given for a
long time was presented when “Aren’t We

Margot Tatham (Janet Eccles), returning
unexpectedly from a holiday in Egypt just
in time to catch her husband (Ronald Ward)
embracing Kitty Lake, is not unnaturally
annoyed; and her annoyance may have lasted
indefinitely but for a reminder that she

of a lover’s protestations. A romantic East-
ern garden with a violin sobbing passionate
music in the distance seemed to her to make
excusable the temporary indiscretion; after
which, frightened of herself, she fled back
to her husband. The likeably cynical old
Lord Grenliam, her father-in-law, fancies
that the seclusion of the British Museum
is the best place for his little philanderingfs.
A well-constructed play, filled out with dia-
logue in which the humor is never forced,
provides a great opportunity for an ex-
tremely well-balanced company. The agree-
able oid cynic presented by Dion Boucicault
is a star characterisation, although there were
moments on the first night when he was too
palpably acting. Irene Vanbrugh, as the good-
natured, commonsensible Lady Frinton, who
is determined to marry the ancient rake,
was very natural; and Janet Eccles, Avitli

ings of an outraged wife, showed dignity as

The one-night-only show of the grand-
opera artists as concert performers at the
Melbourne Town Hall attracted a packed
house, which got good money’s-Avorth for the
cheap prices. Nino Piccaluga showed to
rather better advantage as a concert per-
former than in any of the operas, in which
his acting was weak: the purity of his upper
notes showed to great advantage in Tosti’s
“Ultima Canzone.” But Granforte was still
the outstanding personality. His “Largo al
Factotum” (“The Barber of SeAulle”) was
followed by cascades of applause. It seemed
an affectation on Phyllis Archibald’s part
to sing “Softly Awakes My Heart,” which
has quite good English words, in Italian. The
audience was better pleased by the songs she
subsequently sang in English. Augusta Con-
cato was in good voice, although it seemed
rather a thin organ • the concluding item, a
trio from “II Trovatore,” in which she was
joined by Piccaluga and Granforte, was par-
ticularly fine.
* *
To make way for the Boucicault-Vanbrugh
combination. Muriel Starr and Frank Har-
vey switched over from the King’s to the
Royal on Saturday, and will there finish up
the last ten nights of their season in “The
Silent Witness.” That the melodramatic
throb of the Amurrican-made play, in a
prologue and three acts, has not yet lost
its power was demonstrated by the frequent
use the full house made of its nose and its
palms. Frank Harvey,, as Richard Morgan,
dominated the production from the moment
he turned up in Act I- as the successful
laAvyer on the eve of his nomination as Gov-
ernor; and that is 20 years after he had
been misreported dead by fire in the prologue,
having treated his best girl v y ery badly a
few months before. Harvey’s artistry almost
blinds one to the comic-opera workings of
American justice. The young woman was
rather a toneless feminine as Muriel Stan-
pictured her. Even in the most sobful
moments her voice lacked the needed cres-
cendo. But the Starr “technique” is “nice,”
and the lady was beautifully frocked. As
the son Reg Long was without distinction.
J, B. Atholwood gave a neat sketch of old-
man Rigsy, and Jessie Page was charming
as the lawyer’s prospective wife —she who is
turned off when Morgan gets the chance to
make his old love an “honest woman.”
Another co-optimists’ show :
There are always artists who, having made a
reputation, are willing to spoil it while easy money
can be got; yet there are only a few pictures in the
present collection at the Melbourne Fine Ait Society’s
Gallery which are liable to cause annoyance. The
most; ambitious canvas is a large David Davies sea-
scape in which you can almost feel the fresh breeze
crisping the small waves. George Lambert’s one
offering, a landscape—a bit of Monaro—is more
sincere than most of this artist’s later work. Pen-
leigh Boyd’s two paintings show good treatment of
foreshore, but the water is flat. The “Portrait of
a Lady,” by Hugh Ramsay, is cne of the show's
distinctive features. When Miss Gladys Owen does
not see Sydney outlined in a dingy mood, as in “City
Silhouette,” she goes to another extreme and gives
Hyde Park an astonishingly green sward. Ethel
Stephens, rioting in color, has some good still-life
paintings. There is a flatness in the painting of
some pears in No. 26, however, which gives an
impression that some hungry person has taken a
bite. Harold Herbert shows very conscientious work,
of which “Spring Shadows” is the best. But nis
cows in “Milking Time” won’t hurt you. Although
there is a good treatment of light in Hans Hevsen’s
“The Quarry,” the subject is uninspiring; “Red
Gums” is better. Arthur Streeton has obtained some
nice effects in “Chestnut in Spring” and “Cocoa-
nuts, Magnetic Island,” but his work conveys the
impression of hurry; and H. Septimus Power, pre-
senting some pictures with horses in them, seems
satisfied that Australia will appreciate the privilege
of buying the things he paints, whatever they are.
His “Monte Carlo,” which has no horses, is clever.
Carlyle Jackson is one of the surprises of the show :
there is inspiration in his “Countryside, Spring.”
Vigor marks most of the work of B. E. Minns; his
“The Outlaws” is full of life, and “Sydney from
North Shore” gives an impression of life in the
background. R. Fizelle’s “Autumn” is nicely done,
but Muir Auld’s four contributions are tame. There
is a Fred McCubbin painting of “The Old Brick-
kiln, South Yarra,” in which the tree in the fore-
ground is the most pleasing feature, in a rather
reckless use of strong color. Amongst the others
Leila Bothroyd has some painfully morose views of
scenery; John D. Moore, some unattractive items;
Albert Collins, impressions of a visit to Tasmania
which don’t count for much; and J. R. Eldershaw,
attractive work, of which the best is “Old Mill in
the Midlands, Tasmania.” John Banks’s “Sym-
phony of Green and Gold” is rather painful; there is
a nice exhibition of miniatures by May Butler George,
and Tom Roberts tries to sell a postage-stamp im-
pression of “A Grey Day” for £l5.
MELBOURNE PRINCESS’S—
“THE RISE OF ROSIE O’REILLY.”
Ray and Decima McLean in a specialty
dance which includes some dirty work
with a stockwhip.
Scott and Whaley have been farewelled
with great regret at the Melbourne Tivoli,
where they established themselves as favo-
rite purveyors of good, clean mirth. Maidie
Scott stepped into the gap. Her turn, good
in its way, fails to live up to the big advance
talk. The programme, nevertheless, remains
a good one, with Cardini getting more laugh-
ter and applause than might be expected of
a card-manipulator.
WirtKs’ Circus continues to draw the
madding crowd to the seat slopes of Olympia.
A side-show is supplied by the eager Mel-
bourne kiddies on the outer who want to get
there, and levy small contributions on
passers-by to make up the admission money.

One of the pirates had his cap on the pave-
ment. “Yes, I know there’s enough there,
he told one patron, whose hand paused in
its plunge into his punts’ pocket: but I
want to shout me little sister in.” lhat was
an appeal that could not be dodged.
The “Suburban Society” has its show
The coolness of a number of the leading artists
in Melbourne tow.v’ds the Y.A.S. is based upon their
objection to the “promiscuous” hanging of amateur
work; yet the same work gives more than one
blow in the eye at the exhibition opened at the
Society’s own galleries, Kast Melbourne, on Mon-
day. The Society welcomes the subscription of any-
one claiming to be an artist, and members naturally
expect to be hung ; and hanging in some instances is
too good for them. Two studies by W. B. Mclnnes
outclass the other entries in the large section devoted
to portraits and libels. Esther Paterson’s picture
of Mrs. Frank. Brown stands out amongst several by
the same lady; Charles V heeler has a gracefully
posed study of “Mary and Betty Reid ’; “A Brown
Study,” by Hall, is charming; and “Miss Mollie
Agnew” shows Miss Bale at her best in portraituie.
The landscape section is uninspiring, but “A Golden
Hillside,” simply and conscientiously produced by
Walcot, shows a nice touch. J. J. Collins succeeds
with “Loneliness” ; and the “Evening” of Walter
J. Armstrong conveys a pleasing atmosphere of peace.
There is good composition in a small landscape by
T. W. Dewey, in the “Quarry” of Buckmaster, and
in work by Taylor McGhee, Victor Zelman and V.
M. Griffin. A good deal of the rest is neither con-
vincing nor pleasant. Harold Herbert’s conscientious
respect for detail, allied to artistic feeling, is
easily the most pronounced feature of the water-
color section ; but John Hennessy, Miss E. L. Spowers
(in No. 268) and Guthrie Grant earn a word of
approval; and 0. J. Orme, though timid, shows pro-
mise. Mrs. L. E. Reid pictures some gums surrounded
by nice atmosphere. There are wanderings into other
branches, “The Amazon” by Marguerite Mahood being
an excellent contribution to the sculpture section, in
which Douglas Richardson also does well. The
miniature and woodcarving branches are passable.
The elections in Britain have not caused
“Old Bill, M.P.,” to enunciate any more
definite policy than heretofore; but lie still
draws a houseful of voters to the Melbourne
New Palace. “The Lady of the Rose,” at
His Majesty’s, still wears her bloom; and at
the New Princess’s “Rosie O’Reilly” goes on
the clieerful way to her rise.
Miss Elise Steele was not in so good a
mood at her second concert in the Melbourne
Assembly Hall as she was at her first; her
handling of Mozart’s Concerto in D major
showed an advance in technique, but other-
wise there was a lack of grip on the theme,
the result being an unequal performance. In
the Sonata in G major of Guillaume Lekeu
the violinist was more successful. Indeed,
that was a delightful interpretation. And
some of the later items in the programme,
notably Rimski-Korsakov’s “Hymn to the
Sun,” earned more than polite applause.
£ t'f *
Fritz Hart presented for the approval of
the Melbourne Music Club, with its patron,
Melba, looking on, his setting of J. A.
Symonds’s translation of St. Bernard’s hymn,
“Salve Caput,” at the Melbourne Assembly
Hall; and it was duly approved. The ap-
proval was as much captured by Hart’s
clever arrangement as by the work of his
assistants, fine though some of it was. Dr.
Rudall, who as a volunteer did great work
with his English horn in the Grand Opera
Co. orchestra during its Melbourne season,
did some more in the St. Bernard perform-
ance ; Gertrude Healy, with her violin, added
to her rapidly accumulating laurels, show-
ing a depth of spiritual expression ; and Miss
Lilian Stott, although her voice lacks the
strength which might have brought out the
full value of the work, sang with distinction.
The Conservatorium Ladies’ Choir did reason-
ably well.
sjs v : !*
Leon Heron’s show:—
Leon Heron’s exhibit at the Sackville Gallery in
Melbourne can hardly be judged by ordinary stan-
dards of art. It is a quaint display of decorative
work in color in which the creatures of Heron’s
bright fancy are no more than first cousins to human
beings. The best effect of the cult the young
artist is trying to develop is in “Montmartre,” where-
in the shadow of the pair of Apaches—male and
female created he them —looms ominously.
-!- * * *
Pictures in Adelaide are nicely varied-; —
nominally, at any rate. The York is Asiatic,
showing India in one story and China (or
the American idea of it) in the jolly but im-
probable “Thundergate” yarn of a white
adventurer who could not be told from a
Chinese nobleman. West’s has a Yukon
story, with the usual dogs and the attrac-
tive Eva Novak. Wondergrapli comes nearer
home, trying to realise, the Pacific in “Where
the Pavement Ends.” The Pav. alone is
confessedly Yank, with an exciting hook-and-
ladder story of city firefighters. In variety
the Majestic has exchanged Con Moreni’s
pleasant little co. for the very similar one
of George Wallace; and Albert Whelan is
just coming in at the Royal.

“OR, OY; VOT A BITHNESS!”
“Ikcy, Ikcy! Der vet paint—mind der pcautiful Rembrandt! Dot's der second Old
Master you've ruined in a reek!"
“S. Gumm” : There will be an exhibition
of British films in Sydney Town Hall on
November 15, arid the show will run for a
week. The Limbless Soldiers’ Association
will get the profits, and for that reason
alone there should be “capacity” business
every night; but if the pictures maintain
the standard set by recent British films they
will be worth seeing on their own account.
I asked half a dozen film-fanciers, by no
means prejudiced against the American
article, to name the finest plioto-play they
have witnessed-in a twelvemonth. The an-
swer in every case was “Fay Compton’s
‘This Freedom’ —best I have seen for years.”
Bert Levy writes :
I question the report of Mario Majeroni’s death,
chronicled by “N. Importa” (B. 23/10/’24). On
the day I left New. York for Australia (July'23),
Mario bade me good-bye on Broadway and gave me
the sad news • that there was no hope for his
brother George, who was fighting consumption at
Saranac Lake. Both Mario and George are my
lifelong pals, and we are fellow-members of the New
York Greenroom Club. Our friendship dates from
the time when their father was the matinee idol of
Melbourne in “Jealousy” and “Fedora”, at the Bijou
fully 35 years ago. I was a boy on the paint frame
with George Gordon then. It has been rumored that
George Majeroni has lost the fight, and passed on,
but I am hoping that this is not so, for none of
the New York theatrical papers to hand have men-
tioned it. Another hopeful sign is. that I have not
received a notice from the Greenroom Club of the
death of a fellow-member. At any rate, I feel
certain that Mario is alive and well.
“Ctesar’s Gliost”: Let me assure “Cen-
turion” (B. 23/10/’24) that I am prepared
to allow cavalry officers to take their riding-
whips into ladies’ drawing-rooms, just as I
am prepared to let them take their noses;
but circus-tricks amongst the vases are as
unallowable as ostentatious buglings with the
nasal organ. And it was over Worster’s habit
of flaying the atmosphere in the lady’s house
that the argument started.
“A.P.”: “Centurion” (B. 16/10/’24)
omitted “Please Give Me a Penny, Sir,”
from his list of lachrymose ballads. It is a
good deal older than the tear-compellers he
mentions —it was brewed in the ’seventies
—but it has never lost its hold on the great
heart of the nation. AVith what pathos did
Beaumont Read pour it out when the song
was in its youthful prime! Armcs Beau-
mont, too. I have heard Beaumont give
“Please Give Me a Penny, Sir,” after a
thrilling solo ftom grand opera. And the
audience greatly preferred the maudlin old
whine.
“Cflesar’s Ghost: The disclosure in a Mel-
bourne court case that Howett AVorster was
getting £5O a week started a controversy
as to actors’ salaries, past and present.
Gladys Moncrieff is credited with drawing
£ll2 per week; and in the course of Emelie
Polini’s argument in the N.S.AA r . Supreme
Court it was stated that Emelie paid income-
tax on £4OOO a year. Yet Julius Knight, at
the zenith of his Australian popularity,
was satisfied with £4O per week; returning
subsequently, he contracted for a share of
the profits, and it didn’t pan out nearly so
well. Rignold was once interviewed about
an important member of his co. who had
drifted into a domestic dispute like Howett
AVorster, and raised the same plea—that his
weekly salary had to provide for contingen-
cies, such as “resting.” The scribe tried to
draw George into a general discussion on
actors and their incomes, but Rignold was
not to be drawn. “I pay this man eight
quid a week,” he said, “and as long as he
suits, that’s all that concerns me.” The
reporter was nonplussed. “But, Mr. Rig-
nold,” he suggested, “however big the salaries
they receive, actors are always poor, are
they not?” “Damn poor, most of them!
replied George.
“D AV.” • Maurice Rosenthal’s company,
which . each week at Manly produces somv
thing hew and up-to-date in the way or
drama, is doing very well, financially and
otherwise. Maybe the trend m Sydney will
be the same as it is in London, I here the
high rents of AVest-end theatres make experi-
ments too risky, except for millionaires; so
the man whose ideas embrace something out
of the way, in matter or in manner, must
perforce go to the suburbs. To see Shaw.
Tchekhov or Eugene O’Neill, you leave St
James’s for ’Ampstead, where a drill-hall has
been converted into the Everyman Iheatu.
Likewise, Shakspeare, Ibsen and mediaeval
moralities are not casual visitors but stay-
at-homers in the “Old Vic.” across the river
in Slumland.
“R.K.D.N.”: One loses count of the num-
ber of irrevocable and absolutely final fare-
wells that have been bidden to the Australian
stage by popular performers. lbe gentle-
men mostly desire to get to London, quite
laudably anxious for a footing there. *he
ladies, almost without exception, are dead
tired of the footlights’ glare, the hectic life,
the unrestful touring, the notoriety, man-
agerial dictatorship and a hundred and one
other botherations. AVhat salary can com-
pensate them for the lack .of home life? They
long for the rest and peacefulness of retire-
ment. Oh, for a little farm, miles from
anywhere, where they can quietly breed a
few pigs and keep a few ducks! (Always
the “few ducks” are mentioned. AAHiy? AVliat
is there so restful and retiring about ducks?)
They blow us their farewell kisses. They
weep a little, but the parting had to come.
The usher throws the last bouquet, and at
length down comes the curtain. Gone for
ever. And in less than a year the discon-
solate pigs and the despairing ducks are
farewelled, and the fair creatures return, by
special request, to the scene of their former
triumphs, to be received (sometimes) with
rapture. It’s all very affecting. You can’t
keep a good musical-comedy girl down —on
the farm.
“.Teune Premier” : Australia used to be
far better served with dramatic fare than it
is to-day. Two managements now share the
catering between them, whereas a decade or
so back there were at least five theatrical
firms giving us assorted plays. In addition
to the Williamsons. Bill Anderson was run-
ning drama, with Eugenie Duggan and the
late Cyril Mackay in the leading parts :
Hugh Buckler and Violet Paget Were put-
ting up some excellently-acted comedies (in-
cluding Shaw and Arnold Bennett pieces) ;
the Hamilton-Plimmer crowd was doing ditto,
the mummers including Titheradge. 11. R.
Roberts, Styan, Lizette Parkcs and Beatrice
Day; and George Marlow was giving bellow-
drama lovers good value.
“B.P>.”: I thank “Hambone” (B.
23/10/’24) for confirming my statement that
“Dick AA'liittington” was played in Sydney
in 1897. There were three Sydney pantos
in that year. Her Majesty’s staged “Babes
in the AVood,” with Ada Reeve as principal
boy, Alice Leamar as principal girl. George
de Lara as the Dame, and Bert Gilbert as
the wicked uncle. Carrie Moore and Lily
Titheradge were the babes. At the Lyceum
“Dick” was the bill. The McMahons were
in management there, and had for principal
boy Fanny Liddiard and for principal girl
Celia Mavis; the dame was Harry Shine.
Also Rickards ran an excellent panto., the
name of which has escaped me, at the Royal.
His. principal boy was Addie Conyers, though
through her indisposition Edie Hayter nlayed
for the first few nights. It was in the “Babes”
panto, that Sydney first saw Ada Reeve and
Bert Gilbert, who set the town laughing with
liis “How dare you, you blackguard?” But
Ada had already appeared in Melbourne in
“The Gay Parisienne” and “The French
Maid.” The “Babes” performers I have
mentioned were the original ones. There
were subsequent alterations in the cast; for
instance, Carrie Moore took Alice Leainar’s
part when that volatile lady boiled over, or
bubbled over, or something. By the way, the
“book” for “Dick Whittington” was by
Frank Myers, Bulletin writer of aforetime.
From an Adelaide critic:—
Blamire Young has a show at the Society of Arts
Gallery. It is a strange collection, with blues,
greens and reds over-brilliant in landscape; with
trees sometimes showing an edge as definite as that
of a thunder-cloud, sometimes vague exudations that
recall. the ectoplasm Conan Doyle delights in, and
sometimes again touched in with delicate fancy that
is yet . real enough. Elsewhere are tree backgrounds
letting in light through definite, shaped loopholes.
Certainly a great painter for the stage was lost when
Blamire Young turned his attention to the smaller
canvas. His figure studies are not less characteristic ;
it seems likely that when analysing Goya lately he
got some useful hints from that Spaniard for his own
•work. It is understood that Adelaide Art Gallery
would look favorably on this show but for already
having its statutory limit of three paintings by this
artist. Mr. Young himself says that Adelaide was
the first city really to recognise and encourage him.
THE MINOR ACTOR.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
Croak was an actor, middle-aged,
Who al..ays played a minor part,
Though hotly • all his being raged
To do a thing distinctly Art.
He came on when the stage was thronged,
And to play Hamlet ever longed.
Croak played the hind legs of a mule,
Ur as a flunkey bore a plate,
For simple servants as a rule
The boss considered “just his weight.”
He said “The carriage waits ; below,”
And thirsted to play Romeo.
He bore a table on the stage,
And he arrayed a meal or two,
The sanest actor of his age,
.Who wanted something fine to do
To prove his Caesar would amaze,
And set the rivers all ablaze.
He came on with the ribald crowd
Of rustics in their smocks bedight,
Who knged to play Othello proud.
You’ll , see one in a smock to-night.
Do not regard him as a joke,
But sympathise—lor he is Croak.

OBJECTS OF THE COMPANY.
The Company is being formed for the purpose of acquiring from the Vendors, viz., Mandated
Development Company, Limited, the whole of its undertaking in the Mandated Territory of New
Guinea, and for the purpose of developing and turning to account its property there.
INTRODUCTION.
The prospect of this Company obtaining oil in commercial quantities is exceedingly bright, in
view of the fact that the Vendor Company has, by its operations, already proved, at a depth otutt., tne
existence of oil of high quality and in quantities which indicate the presence of large accumulations.
While it is admitted that all oil ventures are highly speculative, the directors feel justified in
taking the view that the discovery of oil in payable quantities) is more a probability than a possimmy
' n Should’those expectations be realised, the reward to the Company’s shareholders should be of no
ordinary character, for, as the history of the oil fields in the United States of America so amply
illustrates, no form of speculation offers such wonderful returns to the investor.
OPERATIONS OF VENDOR COMPANY.
In February, 1924, Mandated Development Company, Limited, was granted a License to prospect
for oil and coal over an area of 1000 square miles, which area includes the Matapau oil seepages and the
boring site selected by Professor Schlenzig in 1913. , , , , , ~
A prospecting expedition, under the leadership of Mr. J. A. Spencer, was despatched to the area,
arriving there in May. This expedition included Mr. E. A. Briggs, B.Sc., M.Sc. of Sydney I niversity,
as geologist, and Mr. W. Ross as driller. Mr. Ross was formerly employed by the Anglo-1 ersdan
Company, in Papua, and he has had 25 years’ experience on American oil fields (including 10 yeais
with the United Oil Company in Colorado, two years drilling contractor in Wyoming, and four years
with the Magnolia Petroleum Company in Oklahama and Texas). The expedition took with it a suitable
prospecting drilling plant, and operations were at once commenced to prove the existence of mineral
These operations speedily met with success, as early in June, oil was struck at a depth of 42ft.
A bulk sample of the oil obtained, amounting to about of) gallons, has been brought to Sydney,
and analysis has proved it to be of excellent quality, the benzine and kerosene contents amounting
together to over 55 per cent.
ANALYSTS’ REPORTS.
The Commonwealth Government Analyst’s report, dated 14th October, states:-
The completed examination of the oil indicated the presence of a heavy benzine fraction; boiling
range 130 deg. F. to 150 deg. F., specific gravity at 60deg. F.:—0.781 and flash point 82.4 deg. F.
The principal components of the volatile fraction of the oil would appear to be unsaturated cyclic
hydrocarbons (naphthenes) as indicated by the high formolite number and aromatic hydrocarbons. This
data confirms the opinion expressed in the preliminary report that this ciude oil closely resembl
in properties certain types of Borneo petroleum.
The crude oil corresponds in its properties generally to a solar oil, and, without tieatment of any
kind, is suitable for use as a liquid fuel oil.
Messrs. Dixon and Byrn, of Reiby Lane, Circular Quay, report:— , , vaY
We find it to be a paraffin base oil, containing very little sulphur and only traces of paraffin wax.
It compares very favorably with other crude oils in yield of product, approaching most closely the
Russian (Baku) field in character, showing only a small percentage of benzine and volatile oils, but a
hio-h percentage of both kerosene and lubricating oil fractions, and very little wax and residue.
° ' GEOLOGIST’S REPORT.
The following extract from Mr. Briggs’ report summarises his findings:—
1. All the conditions essential to the occurrence of oil are present in the Matapau field.
2. There is definite evidence from the surface indications that oil-bearing strata occur in the
Matapau field. The principal surface indications are:—
(a) Oil seepages or oil springs.
(b) Gas-pools.
(c) Occurrence of salt springs.
3. The most important geologic system, from the standpoint of the occurrence of
throughout the world, is the tertiary. Tertiary rocks yield over 50 per cent, of the world’s
of oil The beds in the Matapau field belong to the tertiary system.
4. The test bore has proved indisputably the occurrences in the Matapau field of oil-bearing strata
which are first met with at a depth of 42 feet on the side of the Wakip anticline.
5. On bailing this test well, 40 gallons of oil per day have been saved. The well is now
tempoiarilv plugged, but the drilling plant has been left in position
6. This is the first well to be drilled and the first oil to be obtained in the Mandated Terntoiy
7. The bore, though plugged, can be speedily opened and the production of oil proceeded wdth
within a few hours after the working party reaches the field. u ....... ...
8. The analyses of samples taken from 50 gallons of this oil show that the oil obtained from the
Matapau field is very similar in its composition to certain types of oil from the Borneo and Baku
(Russia) fields. ___
V DRILLER’S REPORT.
Mr. Ross reports as follows: , .. , . , .
“I claim no technical geological knowledge, but from 25 years’ practical experience and personal
observation in the development of the various oil fields of America, I would state that I have never
seen any better or more favorable possibilities for the development of a large and profitable oil held
than the area over which this company holds a license. .
“To mv mind after having been on the ground and having obtained oil of the quality and quantity
which this proved to be, and at such a shallow depth, there is little doubt of the future success of
development with equipment large enough to go to any depth required. Although it should not be
necessary to go to more than 1500 feet, we must be prepared to go to 3500 feet in the event of that
licinsr necessary. . ,
‘‘The preliminary wmrk has proven the formation to be uniform and favorable for the accumulation
and retention of oil in large quantities. .......
“The sands in which we found the oil prove to be of a soft and porous nature, which is favorable
for a large production, as it furnishes natural storage for the accumulation of oil and gas. While we
had very little gas in the present bore, more could not be expected at so shallow a depth, as there
was prtfcticallv no overburden to retain any pressure.” , ...
Professor Sir Edgeworth David, at a lecture given to the Millions Club on 16th September by Mr.
Briggs on the discovery of petroleum in New Guinea, after paying tribute to Mr. Briggs ability as
geologist, is reported in the Daily Press to have said: . , , ...
“Tho Matapau area of the Mandated Territory had previously been examined bv representatives
of the Anglo Persian Oil Company, whose report was not very encouraging, but he could not believe they
had seen much of the country, and they certainly had pot seen the bore Mr. Briggs’ party had put
down Mr Briggs acting as geologist for the Mandated Development Company of Sydney, had examined
the district in greater detail, and had succeeded in locating a site for a bore, near the summit of an
arch in oil-bearing strata. This bore (four inches in diameter) had struck oil bearing sand at a
denth of 40ft and oil worked its wav into the bore at the rate of at least 40 gallons a day. With the
crude appliances at hand, about 50 gallons of oil had been obtained. He regarded it as significant that
the very first bore the party put down had yielded a promising flow of oil. The samples which nad
been brought back for examination were at least of distinct commercial value, and apparently there
was a great area of oil-bearing formation.” CONCLUSION
The net results of the operations of the Company to date are, that the existence in the area of oil
of high quality has been proved, and the prospects of a large supply are, judging from the geological
report and the opinion of an experienced driUer,^ excellent.
The only agreement affecting the Company is as follows: ;
Agreement dated the 28th day of October, 1924 between the Mandated Development Company
Limited of the cne part and Charles Alfred Jaques on behalf of the proposed company of the
A copy e of P the above agreement and of the draft Memorandum and Articles of Association may be in-

The Rapid Healer—
The Reliable Remedy.
Never a day passes but that Rexona scores another triumph
over those serious troubles of life—Sores, Bad Legs, Piles, Eczema,
Pimples, Blotches, Burns, Nasal Catarrh and Rheumatism. The
dainty little triangular pot of Rexona, the Rapid Healer, contains
a combination of the most curative, antiseptic, soothing and healing
properties known to science.
Rexona is the Skin Remedy of the Age, because it destroys
the harmful germs that may be present in a sore, pimple, or any
abrasion of the skin, thus preventing any contagion of the blood
and at the same time causes a new, healthy skin to grow. Rexona
immediately reduces the inflammation and pain; it acts as a distinct
stimulant to the pores of the skin, and sets up a healing action
immediately that increases day by day.
Bad leg sores that have resisted every other treatment
succumb almost immediately to its wonderful influence, while for
Piles there is nothing its equal.
Rexona—Best for Bad Legs,
Piles, Eczema and Ringworm.
You cannot afford to take chances with any of these serious
troubles. What you want is a real, reliable remedy which is easily
applied and can be depended upon to heal quickly. Rexona fills
this need. There is no better treatment than to get a tin of
Rexona, and apply this antiseptic healer night and morning. First
wash the parts affected with warm water and Rexona Medicated
Soap, and then apply a little Rexona, binding with a soft cloth
when possible.
Rexona is a specially-prepared product, made especially to
overcome such serious troubles as these. Those who use Rexona
will not be disappointed, for Rexona heals rapidly and absolutely.
Rexona Heals Rashes, Sores
and all Skin Eruptions.
Sometimes when you are at your wits’ end and feel that your
efforts are a failure, a friend can make the right suggestion and
pull you through. Obstinate sores of long standing reduce some
unfortunate sufferers to despair. Remedy after remedy fails, and
it seems nothing will help, but you cannot have tried Rexona, for
Rexona does not fail. All sores should be cleansed once or twice
a day with warm water and Rexona Soap. Rexona Medicated Soap
destroys germs and encourages the skin to healthy action. Then
apply a dressing of Rexona, the Rapid Healer. Inflammation
will quickly subside, healthy new skin will form, and the body begin
to build up new flesh again. You have not given yourself a fair
chance until you have tried Rexona Soap and Rexona Ointment.

than “SPEEDICUT” Tools.
The fine quality of the famous
“SPEEDICUT” steel from which
SPEEDICUT
High-speed drills, milling cutters,
reamers, slitting saws and centre
drills are made, coupled with
highly-scientific manufacturing
methods, has given to every
“SPEEDICUT” tool a big cutting
power, and a unique capacity for
standing up to hard work. Thos.
Firth and Sons produce the
“SPEEDICUT” tools through-
out, from the ingot to the final

This little £lO,OOO medical benefit-cim-
insurance co. now closes one phase of its
. career. Its purchase tu- the young Austra-
lian Federal Life was recently announced.
It is to carry on as a separate concern, but
the retirement of Dr. Bolirsmann and F.
Sparrow, the old directors, is the first visible
change. In this the last balance-sheet issued,
under their management, the features which
have marked the co. are reiterated : “No inter-
est whatever overdue,” “no second mortgage
among the company’s securities.” For years
it lias paid its shareholders 10 p.e., w r ith an
additional 10 p.c. every third year. The
nature of the business handled is indicated
by the following comparison :

The price paid by the Federal has not been
disclosed. It has got a good little business.
But whether it is good at the price the
Federal has paid for it this paper doesn't
know. All it knows is that a law which
allows life-assurance policies to be trafficked
in in this way is very rotten ; for, of course,
the poor policy-holders had no say in the
matter —wouldn’t have had a say even if it
had been proposed to transfer the business
to a syndicate of Long Bay or Pentridge
capitalists.

This year, for the first time, the C.F.S.
declared no dividend. A dry spell in the
dairying areas was the chief cause; another
doubtless was that the big North Coast
Co-op. Co. —of Byron Bay and elsewhere—
which hitherto had marketed chiefly through
the C.F.S., handled its Sydney business itself.
While these things cut into gross earnings,
exes, were hardly affected:—

The growth of certain outgoings is a very
serious matter; and N. S. Wales co-operators
ought to seriously consider whether the in-
crease cannot be met in some way. Look
at this rise in the past four years:—
Total Expenses per £lOO

1923.. 4,004,157 147,248 3 13 6
1924.. 3,570,291 148,722 4 3 4
Of course, in such a business you can’t re-
duce your overheads to meet a bad year; but,
even making allowances for that, it is clear
that the producers are paying more than twice
as much for the handling of their goods as
they were a little while ago; and the ques-
tion is whether the multiplication of hand-
ling agents (there are now three co-operative
wholesalers in Sydney) is the right way 1o
get low figures. If three are better than
one, why not 30 instead of three? For the
rest, the co. is, as usual, financially all right;
and —one thing to be thankful for —its book
debts have not increased as a result of the
greater competition:—
Due to Sundry March
Consignors, etc. Debtors. Turnover.
1920 .. £156,687 £221,135 £377,573
1921 .. 192,156 260,596 467,681

1923 .. 159,606 236,281 389,363
1924 .. 154,746 178,960 279,996
A co. that can keep its purchasing customers
so well up to the mark that they owe for less
than three weeks’ supplies is doing very well
—on that side of the business, anyway.

Alligator River Syndicate has acquired
100 acres on the new Yemelba (N.T.) gold-
field, and calls it the Eumelda group. Five
tons of ore are to go to the smelters to test
bulk values. George Laurie, who discovered
the field, estimates that this ore will return
between £3O and £4O per ton. The syndi-
cate has also acquired the Flora Belle silver-
mine and 80 acres surrounding it. Old re-
ports show rich yields, but the mine ceased
work 25 years ago when water was struck.
Walter Colley has been chosen by the syndi-
cate to report on these mines, and to inspect
a dredging area on the Collia tinfield. also
under offer to the syndicate. He has left
for Darwin, and expects to report by Christ-
mas.

The tyre you’ve been waiting for—
Goodyear Supertwist Balloon
An achievement extraordinary!
This new and remarkable feature of
Goodyear Balloon Tyres—SUPER-
TWIST. An extremely elastic new
cord material, perfected by Goodyear.
This new construction of cord material
gives to the individual cords as much
as 50 per cent, greater elasticity.
It has the ability to withstand the
constant flexing required of balloon
tyres, and to resist severe road shocks
—a feat of vast importance.
Numerous tests showed that tyres
built of this enduring new material
delivered more than 100 per cent,
greater service than tyres made of an
equal number of plies of standard
cords—truly a remarkable accomplish-
ment.
SUPERTWIST used exclusively by
Goodyear is now in regular produc-
tion, and is built into Goodyear Bal-
loon Tyres of both types —to fit new
small diameter wheels and rims—and
to fit present rims on the majority of
cars now in use.
Goodyear means Good Wear .

“YOUR HEALTH, M’ DEAR!”
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
“Mr. Spielvogel said some American cities paid
a bonus for flies —so much per pint. Dr. McNeil: ‘They
have no other use for their pots.’ ”
“Go, bring to your love a pint o’ wine” —
No U.S. poet repeats that order ;
Banned is the blood of the grape divine;
In another fashion he now looks toward her.
“Go, bring me a trusty swat,” he cries,
And his only use for the silver tassie
Is to measure how many pints o’ flies
He slays for the health of his bonnie lassie.
victoria. SYD. C.
Gone on his last prospecting trip, Steel
Traill, one of the pioneer prospectors on the
Speck’s wet west coast —he discovered and
pegged the Hercules, the parent of the group
now held by the Electrolytic Zinc Co.; but,
too trustful, he allowed the section to become
forfeit, and it was repegged by others.
In the period traversed by the last
railway report N. S. Wales opened 12 new
lines. They covered 441 miles, and almost
all finished at dry dead-ends. They were
all guaranteed to send their trade to Sydney,
and they all started at once to lose money.
They cost millions, and the group lost,
for the year, their whole interest bill
(£182,710) and £3352 of working expenses.
Dr. Mollison, who is mostly known to the
public through giving evidence in Victorian
murder trials as to how the deceased came
to be a corpse, will shortly reach the
age at which he should retire from the staff
of Melbourne Uni. However, as there are
no other specialists in forensic medicine
available for his job, he has been asked to
carry on. Which he can do very well—he
is no yellow autumn leaf.
“Plimsoll”: Has the flag of Dantzig, the
free city with the long corridor created by
the Versailles Treaty, appeared in Sydney
Harbor yet? It has a red background with
yellow crown and two white crosses, And it
turned up in Singapore the other day on aHugo
Stinnes steamer. Which suggests that the
Paris peacemakers’ efforts to cut the Te«-
ton’s claws were as successful in the case of
Dantzig as in that of the rest of the world.
An oldster who deserved well of his country
was John W. Russell, who, at 82, closed his
last volume at Bacchus Marsh (Vic.) the other
day. His father, a Church of England par-
son, brought him to Australia when be was
16. Both were bookish men, strong forces
in culture and education at a time when such
forces were badly needed; and as an educa-
tionist John made his mark. His son is the
traffic superintendent of Vic. railways.
“X2X” : The medical inspection of immi-
grants from foreign countries ought to be
stricter than it is. Recently there have been
treated in the hospitals of N. S. Wales and
Queensland several cases of skin-complaint
which, up till then, had been practically un-
known in this country, and in at least two
instances the sufferers were immigrants from
the Mediterranean. In addition, there are
infectious eye-complaints known to be rife in
the Balkans which ought to be guarded
against. America’s Ellis Island system has
come in for a good deal of attack, but at
least it has the virtue of reducing to a mini-
mum the risk of the introduction of disease;
and a modification of it should be adopted
here.
Went on his last exploring trip the other
day, at 93, Duncan Ourrie, of Lismore
(N.S.W.). Duncan came to Australia 67
years ago from Dunoon, in Scotland, and
the village of Dunoon, on the N.S.W. North
Coast, was named by him. He never married,
but roughed it to the end, and a fortnight be-
fore he died made a trip alone to Brisbane.
“Bay Webb” ; In the days of old-time
clippers, when canvas was making its last
struggle against steam, the City of Luck-
now unexpectedly sighted on the homeward
voyage the City of Corinth, whose skipper
had boasted in Melbourne of how he would
show us the way if he ever got the chance.
She sailed to leeward, whilst we hugged the
wind; consequently the ships were soon hull-
down apart. Whenever force of wind would
allow us to hunt for disaster, we hunted
after it with spread of canvas which pressed
the vessel more under the water than out
of it. What she would not sail over we drove
her through. By this means we forced our
vessel along until a glow upon the horizon
told of a ship on fire. Race or no race, we
could not leave men to be roasted to death
in mid-ocean, and we turned from our course
to rescue. By the time we had lost about
ten miles, and practically the race, our
glasses revealed that we were sailing to a
whaler, whose crew would ask nothing more
than to be left alone to continue boiling the
blubber they were stripping! Our master
was ordinarily possessed of a rich and
variegated vocabulary, but he could find no-
thing in it to do justice to this disaster.
A Sydney radiographer has been experi-
menting on scientific lines for some time in
an effort to locate metallic ore-bodies by
the use - of wireless. Success is now claimed.
The basic principle is that, while wireless
signals can be transmitted directly through
the earth on the beam system, they will be
intercepted and deflected on encountering a
metallic ore-body. That is to say, a beam
can be picked up direct by a receiver unless
intercepted by a body of metallic ore, but
will only be received by deflection should
such a body intervene. Trigonometrical
principles are made use of, and by this means
a series of triangulations are carried out
with the object of locating and actually map-
ping a body of metallic ore. Theoretically
the idea appears sound, and recent experi-
ments on the Yerranderie silver-field indi-
cate that there may be something in it. If
there is it will mean a great deal to mining
companies; for although it is not claimed
that the nature or values of the bodies so
located can be determined, still it would
save driving where there was no ore. The
deficiencies are obvious. One station must
be situated so that the beam can pass to it
through the earth. Which means that level
country (unless already worked at some
depth) is ruled out. It is too soon to ex-
press an opinion, but the invention has one
thing at least in its favor —it is Australian.

Tusitala.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
DEAR Tusitala, with the heart
So gentle yet so leonine,
I would some mariner might chart
Your last long voyage o’er the brine
To where your barque now rests embayed,
With Allah’s wild woods lending shade.
Maybe with morning hand in hand
You walk along the blue lagoon
That curves within an island bland
Like the keen sickle of the moon,
And hear, subdued and satisfied,
The low lap-lapping of the tide.
And yet, if so, your tuned ear still
Must note upon some landward breeze
The storm-vexed cordage wailing shrill
Unto the blown innumerous seas,
And rouse your soul to dare the flood
Like a tame lion roused by blood.
That viking soul would hear in sleep
The Tempest’s quick intaken breath,
The broken sobbing, and the deep
Bull-roarings from the throat of Death,
And see the sheeted cyclone driven
By the mad charioteers of Heaven.
The wide sea called you, but the calms
Are netted round you where you sleep
Beneath the grave bird-haunted palms
On Vaea’s crown, tabooed and steep;
And lips that were so eloquent
Are sealed in great and dumb content.
I often muse on your last day
When, tired of thinking of strange things—
Patents of thought for work and play—-
There came to you the Shape that brings
The sandals for the journey and
The Palmer’s staff that rests the hand.
The day was done; the surf beat white
Upon the keen-toothed outer reef;
One ghost-like star forewarned of night,
Together slumbered wind and leaf,
And broad and far outrolled there lay
The sea and the Samoan Bay.
The ink was wet upon the page
Where all the household of your brain —
Wraith, elfin, merryman and sage—
Each as accustomed, spoke so plain
You scarce could hear, through all the stir,
The coming of Death’s messenger.
Until the hour a priest revealed
With Sacred Host and Golden Dove,
Who under the last unction sealed
Your soul for the fair place of Love,
Warm as the summer when it fills
The vales between Illyrian hills.
Here where Night’s wheeling legions pass
And peer into the jungle gloom,
I see as in a looking-glass
The soul of you within the tomb;
And thus I find what here I seek —
Delos, and her Immortal Greek.
MAO BILAN D.
DABIUS.
The Club.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
ALEC MONROE, Bachelor of Medicine
J\ (Ed.), beloved by his professional
"" brethren —a somewhat severe test of
worth where criticism is free and sometimes
not devoid of personal prejudice—had his
sign up in Macquarie-street. He was 67
and for ten years had given up general prac-
tice to specialise as a consulting alienist —
the mentally abnormal had always fascinated
him. His son had followed in his footsteps
but had graduated at the local Medical
School. As an only son he had been brought
into closer touch with his father than is
usual in the average paternal relation.
Though the son was better versed in the
modern developments of medicine, he found
in the shrewd and experienced father a wis-
dom to which he frequently appealed.
One winter evening, in the son’s study, the
two sat in comfortable saddle-backs before
the fire. ... .. ,
“I think,” said Ronald, the son, ‘she
might pull through if only I could rouse her
to an effort —make her hopeful, knock it into
her that she must do something for herself.
As it is, she simply drifts, with a sort of
fatalism; says, ‘You know, Doctor, it’s no
good,’ and smiles complacently. You’ve met
that sort of thing?”
“Yes, and not once or twice, Ronald.
There’s really very little in the prescription
business —any effect is probably on the men-
tal side. I would back Nature and the per-
sonal factor all the time. I’m no psycholo-
gist, as you know —all that came after my
ti me —but I have noticed that when some
men are down with worry, and their will
power has practically gone, the primitive
instincts seem to range at large; somewhere
in the sub-conscious fatalism lurks—and
then comes up. Many years ago now, when
the Queensland sugar-plantations were
worked by Kanaka labor, I paid a visit to a
friend who had been a student in my year,
and who was in charge of a Kanaka hospi-
tal at Mackay. Of course I dodged in and
out of the place; sometimes went the even-
ing round with him, and he told me-—and
showed instances to prove his words—
that with many of the cases lying in the cots,
mostly enteric and phthisis, it was useless to
do anything, as they had a fixed idea that
they would die, and die they did. That’s
primitive man, the fatalist; and primitive
man often comes to the top when your civi-
lised being is down with disease. Your lady
may be a case of that kind. She perhaps
has this fixed idea, and if so I’m afraid there’s
nothing much to be done for her. Christian
Scientists have, after all, a root fact at the
bottom of their overlay of rubbish. There
is something in holding out against disease;
the man who persists in thinking there isn’t
much the matter with him, and that he will
pull through all right, goes far, if the trouble
isn’t organic, to make it a fact, and probably
does came through.”
“I believe you’re right—it helps im-
mensely. It’s the real virtue in ‘the good
bedside manner’ —keeping the patient’s pecker
up.”
“Probably! I’ll tell you an odd thing that
once happened to me. You had just started
at Grammar. In my day, as you know, there
were no Australian Medical Schools, and
most Australians intending to qualify went
to Edinburgh. There had grown up a tradi-
tion about the Edinburgh School of Medicine,
and a very worthy one, dating back from
the early part of the eighteenth century. It
was quite the thing to go there, and we went.
I’m thankful it was so, for there I learned,
beside medicine, that there is something in
the Scotch character, its earnestness and its
thoroughness, which makes great surgeons and
fine physicians; and I got some of the bene-
fit of it. We worked hard, but had our share
of fun. Edinburgh has been a centre, since
and before Scott’s time, of literary and art
interests. We used to form clubs and societies
for discussing these subjects, though fre-
quently they were just a mask —what now-
a-days they call camouflage—for having a
good time. Well, there were seven young-
sters, Scotch and ‘Colonial,’ who formed one
of these little sets and called it ‘The Septern
Club.’ They were rather idle dogs as stu-
dents, and explained the title as a learned
reference to the seven sa.pientes of Greece.
Their wisdom was a philosophy of letting the
other man do the work. Some called . them
‘the seven sages,’ others ‘the seven swine’—
the latter the more popular. It is on this
set the story turns. They were in their first
year, I in my third.
“The next act was this. A friend of mine
who had graduated at Edinburgh about three
years later than I had (and after some diffi-
culty, by the way) returned to Sydney, where
he had been born. Both parents were dead,
and the family scattered. He picked up a
country practice, and married. Soon after
that he came back, having received an ap-
pointment at the Coast Hospital. One
evening I had a call from his wife, who
said Tyndall—that was his name—was down
with pneumonia and wished to see me. You
understand, I was not called in profession-
ally ; just sent for as an old friend. Of
course, I went at once, and then and there
he told me this extraordinary story.
“He was quite clear and calm. He said
to me, ‘You remember the Septem Club? It
used to meet on Saturday nights at Ruther-
ford’s Pump.’ I said I did.
“ ‘One of the seven,’ Tyndall went on,
‘was a man named Chalmers, a Scot,
a heavy drinker, whose people gave
him more money than was good for
him. He got through his first year, and
there he stuck, though he remained on for
nearly two years; then he chucked up the
sponge. Had to, in fact, for he was rusti-
cated—women, I suppose, and certainly wine.
After he left I lost sight of him till one day
he turned up at the hospital. That was
nearly three years ago. It appeared that
he had jumped from the balcony of a house
let in apartments and smashed himself on
the pavement. He was badlv injured in-
ternally, and nothing much could be done
for him; it was only a matter of time. I
saw him almost daily, and shortly before he
died he said there was something he would
like to tell me. Then he spun a long yarn
about his doings since the old days in Edin-
burgh. Soon after he had left there his
father died and the estate was found to be
so involved that little remained for the
family. He came to Australia, drifted about,
a bit of drink-wreckage, and did no good.
Just before the smash he had come in from
the back, with about £3O in his pocket, to
have what he called a good time. This was
about Christmas, he said. On the night of
the accident he was drinking solus —he was
a taciturn, inoffensive fellow, seemingly
without a friend but myself.. That night
he had a vision, so he called it, and, as he
told it, the thing sounded too —er —er —epi-
sodic, connected —you know what I mean —
to be the sort of thing we associate with
D.T.’s.
“ ‘This was Chalmers’s vision as he told it.
It was dreary weather, cold and gloomy. He
was alone at night in a room lit by a single
gasjet when suddenly the door of the room
opened and in trooped five of the men who
had been his associates in the Septem Club.
They seated themselves round the table.
Their faces were flushed, and they seemed
to be in a merry, boisterous mood. The
whisky-bottle went round from hand to hand
filling the old-fashioned glasses we used to
have. The one real chair in the room was
vacant, for Chalmers had risen as they en-
tered and withdrawn to the bed in the cor-
ner. He saw no change in the faces of his
old companions, and missed only one. Of
course, he himself was not there; he stood
apart. With these exceptions it was an
exact reproduction of one of the old meet-
ings. With the last round of the whisky
they rose and, seemingly, toasted the vacant
chair. They remained standing, with raised
glasses, and th'en, said Chalmers, they under-
went a rapid and terrible change. The
glasses fell noiselessly from their hands—
the whole scene was carried out in absolute
silence. Each figure changed from youth to
maturity and thus slowly to the end. That
end was loathsome —horrible! Their eyes
sank in and became dull and glazed ; their
clothes fell in mouldy rags from their bodies:
the bodies themselves changed into masses
of corruption. The air of the pent-in room
was filled with the taint of death. With a
shriek Chalmers dashed through the flimsy
French door opening to the balcony, and
threw himself into space. So repulsive was
the memory of this scene to him that he
covered his eyes as he described it to me,
and the picture he called up is burned into
my own memory. I wish to God, Monroe,
that I could blot it out. Now I am
here, sick and helpless, it haunts me. That
was the last time I saw Chalmers alive. He
died two days later. I probed into the facts
as far as I could go. I made inquiry about
the other members of the club, and found
that four were dead—these beyond doubt.
The fifth I traced to Kalgoorlie; he was
reported dead, but I could never verify
the report. One day, looking over the mem-
oranda I had made, I noted an odd coinci-
dence that had escaped me. The four who
certainly were dead had died at intervals
of three years. Odd. wasn’t it? I looked
up the date of Chalmers’s death, and assum-
ing that the unverified death had followed
the rule, found that his also did so.’

Have you suspected
your Kidneys?
Are you dragging along day in and day out with a dull,
throbbing backache?
Do you feel lame in the morning, tired all day; suffer sharp,
torturing twinges at every sudden move? Then there’s something
wrong!
You may never have suspected your kidneys, yet often it’s
the kidneys that are at fault. A cold, strain, or overwork congests
the kidneys and slows them up; poisons accumulate in the system,
and many mysterious aches and pains result.
You may have headaches and dizzy spells, too, with perhaps
some annoying bladder irregularity. Don’t wait for more serious
trouble. Use Doan’s Backache Kidney Pills. They have helped
many Sydney folks. They should help you.
SYDNEY TESTIMONY,
Mr. A. B. Cowell, who lives at the corner of Park Road
and Hardy Street, Mascot, Sydney, says:—“Some months ago I
was suddenly seized with a terrible pain across my back, just
above the kidneys. It did not go away, as I thought at first it
would, but, on the contrary, it got worse, and I was soon so bad
that I was bent almost double. I was completely crippled and
even at night I got very little rest from the constant pain. I
could not turn over without suffering acutely, in fact, no
position was comfortable for long. My secretions were affected,
being thick and cloudy, with a red sediment. I tried different
remedies, but they gave me no relief whatever. One day a
friend suggested I should take Doan’s Backache Kidney Pills,
and it proved to be good advice, too, for three bottles cured me
completely. I feel splendid now, and my recovery is due solely
to Doan’s Backache Kidney Pills.”
Four years later Mrs. Cowell says:—“My son is still well,
Doan’s Backache Kidney Pills having completely banished all
signs of kidney trouble.”
DOAN’S BACKACHE KIDNEY PILLS are sold by all chemists and stores
at 2/9 per bottle, or from Foster-McClellan Co.,
15 Hamilton Street, Sydney.

A WOMAN’S WORD.
Mrs. W. Membrey, Como, 79 Sim-
mons Street. Enmore, says :—“For
three years I was a martyr to Piles,
and I don’t think any ailment causes
more suffering and loss of sleep. I
used Pile remedies, and was treated
by a doctor, but nothing gave me any
relief. After so many failures I
thought there was no cure for this dis-
tressing complaint, but I was mis-
taken, as a treatment with Doan’s
Ointment proved. A short course of
this wonderful preparation cured me,
and I advise sufferers to give it a
trial.”
Eleven years later Mrs. Membrey
says :—“Doan’s Ointment cured me of
Piles over eleven years ago, and I
have been free of the complaint ever
since.”
A MAN’S WORD.
Mr. A. H. Francis, 192 Union Street,
Erskineville, Sydney, says :—“I used
Doan’s Ointment for Itching and Pro-
truding Piles, and I am pleased to tell
you it completely cured me. Previously
I had tried all kinds of Ointments, but
they gave me little or no relief. I was
suffering terribly when I first applied
Doan’s Ointment, and had little hope
of it doing me any good, but its sooth-
ing and healing effect was noticeable
almost at once, and by the time I had
used one pot I was completely cured,
all signs of Piles having disappeared
entirely. I am a great believer in
Doan’s Ointment, and consider it the
best Pile remedy known.”
Twelve months later, Mr. Francis
says:—“l have not been troubled with
Piles since Doan’s Ointment cured me.”

“Strange, father, very strange. But
Chalmers’s ‘vision’ may have been only a
throw-up of the past, a jumble of club, post-
mortems and so on. We know how chaotic
and fantastic these alcoholic delusions are.”
“That may be so, Ronald, but as a rule
there is very little cohesion in their detail.
In this case, Tyndall said, Chalmers’s
account was clear, held together and included
a number of consistent details he did not
give me.”
“I’d rather like to meet your friend Tyn-
dall, and talk it over with him.”
“Impossible, my son. He had a relapse
and never rallied. I remember when I last
saw him saying, ‘You’re doing fine,’ but he
only shook his head. I’m rather of the
opinion he was like your lady patient with
the fixed idea.”
“By the way, he traced only four of the
men, and couldn’t get anything decisive
about the fifth. Chalmers made the sixth.
Anything known about the seventh?”
“Yes, the seventh man was Tyndall.”

Louey Yen’s Tarantulas.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
LOUEY YEN was of the boat people
and lived on the Grand Canal. Though
he had never seen the sea, he had lived
on the water all his life, and had an inherited
contempt for men who dwelt on land and
scratched in the dirt for a living.
Though citizens of China, the boat people
were as a race apart. Born on the crazy
hulks and sampans which littered the mighty
waterway, they mostly died there, often going
ashore for the first time on the day of their
burials. From their least to their greatest
want, the boat people were independent of
the shore. In need of a bag of rice, the
boat dweller had but to wait a while and
the provision hawker would be alongside in
his little boat, every inch of space crammed
with something to meet the wants of his
customers. Hard in his wake came the
seller of vegetables, who could also supply an
occasional pot-plant were one wanted to be
hung with the hencoop out over the stern
of the boat. The fisli-hawker, his fish alive
and floundering in shallow tubs in the
stern of his tiny craft, would open and clean
the fish while his customer waited, making
way alongside for the seller of the utensils
in which the fish were to be cooked. Re-
tailers of wearing apparel, oil for cooking or
lighting, crockery to eat and drink out of,
hot-soup kitchens—one and all plied their
trade up and down the street of water, even
to the seller of hot sugar-cane, who on cold
winter nights sent his weird cry echoing up
and down the dark waters.
In one detail only did the boat folk give
precedence to the land dwellers; their morals
Avere of a lower order. Though a detail
hardly worthy of note, it was the direct cause
of Louey Yen forsaking the water after forty-
five years of strenuous endeavor thereon.
Louey’s wife had proved faithless, and
Louey was in sore distress. Not that he
objected to his wife running away with an-
other man if she felt so inclined. That was
her affair. And he could get another wife
any dark night. The trouble was that she
had taken Louey’s son with her. And that
was serious. Differing from the land dwellers
in most things, the boat people agreed with
them in one —that a father must, at all costs,
have a son to worship at his grave when
he was dead. Left sonless, the life of a dead
Chinaman was too fearsome to contemplate
with equanimity. And there was no cer-
tainty that if he took another wife Louey
would have another son. He might not
have even a daughter, though that would
not matter.
Failing completely in his endeavors to
secure the return of his son, and suspecting
that his supplanter in his wife’s affections
desired to keep the hoy for the same reason
that he desired the boy’s return, Louey had
decided on the use of strategy to secure his
ends.
Once only in all his forty-five years had
Louey previously been away from the Grand
Canal. It had been a great adventure, lead-
ing ultimately to the farthermost ends of
benighted Manchuria, where anything was
likely to happen and most things happened
all at once. Journeying in the company of
a band of fur thieves, Louey could never
afterwards be induced to talk of his adven-
tures. But for one thing of all the things
he had learned he now thanked his joss, and
with the knowledge that was peculiarly his
own he again deserted the Canal and sought
admittance to the home of his supplanter.
To be near his son was all Louey asked.
His wife’s preference being for the other man,
he sought no share in her affections. But he
would work for his keep, doing whatever was
to be done, if allowed to live under the same
roof as his boy. Had the defiler of his home
known what Louey knew, his objection to
the arrangement would have been both em-
phatic and forceful. But Lum War had not
journeyed to the farthermost ends of be-
nighted Manchuria, and his knowledge of the
things Louey understood was no knowledge
at all.
Louey kept strictly to the letter of his
agreement. In 'eturn for two scanty meals
per day he did what was to be done, inter-
fering not at all with the domestic arrange-
ments of the house. To be near his boy
was all he asked —during the day. At night
he sat in a miserable bag shelter behind the
house, chewing hashish and dreaming—of
Paradise, because of the hashish; of all the
horrors of Hell and damnation, because of
Lum War. Between the dreams he trapped
tarantulas —big hairy-legged horrors that he
attracted to him by the aid of captive flies
held under the light of a small opium lamp
on a stool against the bag wall. Pinning the
fly to the stool to make it buzz. Louey would
sit back, his face, generally stolid and expres-
sionless, assuming a look of fiendish deviltry
in the pale light of the little lamp as the
tarantula, attracted by the buzzing of the
fly, advanced in quick runs and long pauses
upon its intended victim. As it made its
final spring, and the buzzing ceased on a
the hand landed it in a ready tin. and Louey,
a step nearer the consummation of his ends,
put out another lure.
Sitting back in the shadow awaiting a
fresh catch, Louey glowed with a deep satis-
faction. He knew exactly what lie would
do with those tarantulas. Unbidden, his
mind reverted to his apprenticeship among
the fur thieves. Raw, naked murder of the
legitimate owners had been the means at
first adopted to secure the mucli-desired furs.
But after a time, and because of the ever-
increasing risk of detection, the crudeness
had worn off. subtlety taking the place of
vicious clumsiness. Louey could recall the
first victim of the new order of things. Sta-
tioned outside a trapper’s hut, shivering and
dejected because of the two feet of snow on
the ground, he had waited while three of his
companions entered to fraternise with the
trapper. Two mortal hours of frozen agony
he endured before a scream from within
brought him to the torn parchment window
of the hut. For years afterwards Louey
often peeped through that window again in
his sleep. Standing birth-naked in the middle
of the floor, frothing at the mouth and
screaming demoniacally, the trapper, a black-
bearded giant of a man, literally tore himself
to pieces with his own naked nails. A half-
empty bottle of wine rested on a bench in
front of the fire. When, ripped and ragged
and bloody, the trapper finally collapsed,
the wine bottle was placed on the floor be-
side him, the furs he had garnered were care-
fully gathered up, and Louey’s companions
departed, leaving nothing in the hut except
a crazy trapper who had drunk himself to
death. It was potent wine, and when next
it was being brewed Louey understood the
reason for the giant tarantulas which went
to give it tang.
Six long months it took Louey to collect
his tarantulas. They were all good taran-
tulas. Louey’s process of eliminating the
unfit guaranteed that. To get the best re-
sults with tarantula wine you must first
catch your tarantula. Louey knew. For
nights on end he had sat without catching
one, and for many more nights on end he
discarded those he did catch because they
did not come up to specifications. Bulk of
body and viciousness of both bite and inten-
tion were essential. To get the maximum of
poison from each insect it was essential that
life should be prolonged to the last second;
and for every second of all the little seconds,
the head of the tarantula, the only part left
showing above the liquid, was pricked and
poked and delicately singed, until the insect
finally collapsed and sank to the bottom, a
soluble ball of seething venom.
Three dozen tarantulas Louey used to the
bottle of wine. And it was good wine—the
best procurable. Three bottles of it used up
almost the whole of Louey’s savings. But
Louey was no niggard where his revenge was
concerned. And, moreover, he would drink
some of that wine himself—from the bottles
in which the tarantualas had not been dis-
solved.
Louey knew his work. With consummate
cunning he wormed himself into the good
graces of L«m War until Lum, far from
objecting to his presence in the house, came
to look for him at night. He is a smart
man who, within a few months, can convert
a teetotaller from the error of his ways. But
Louey did it. With his three bottles of
good wine he did it, giving Lum just suffici-
ent each night to cause him to want some
more. To a fluid dram Louey knew how
far to let Lum go. When the drinking was
finished he would place the bottle between
Lum and the light, intoxicating his victim
with its alluring contents.
Then one night Louey unostentatiously
left a nearly empty and a nearly full bottle
of wine on the table and went out. He had
a headache and was not drinking. Not with
Lum. But in a dirty little shop down the
street he drank, more by far than was good
for him, to celebrate the final consummation
of his revenge. Without drawing much upon
his imagination Louey could qjcture what
would happen when the nearly empty bottle
of wine on Lum’s table was quite empty.
Also he could picture what would happen
after that. It was well he should not be
present then. The most incautious magis-
trate might well become suspicious of a
man whose friend died, raving mad, while
drinking his guest’s wine. But if that guest
was not present....
* * * «
Back at the house Lum War’s conscience
was pricking him. The nearly empty bottle
of wine was now quite empty, and the
sparkle of the liquor in the nearly full bottle,
sitting on the table between Lum and the
light, maddened Lum’s palate until he itched
to take it up and drain it in one great, glori-
ous draught. But there was Louey to be
reckoned with. Perhaps Louey had not in-
tended him to touch the second bottle. Cer-
tainly the cork was loose, offering a ready
means of access to the delectable liquor. But
perhaps Louey was thus testing him, trying
to ascertain if he could be really trusted.
Lum’s integrity was undeniable. But so
was his thirst, which the liquor in the nearly
empty bottle had but whetted. Intrigued,
afire with desire, Lum arose and shuffled
out to Louey’s bag shelter. Perhaps Louey
possessed another bottle; in which case the
broaching of the tantalising bottle on the
table would not be such a heinous offence.
So Lum reasoned, and it was with a grunt
of satisfaction that he descried a half-full
bottle on a stool beside Louey’s bed. In a
moment his mind was made up as to what he
should do. A drink he must have. But he
would not leave it for Louey to chide him for
his greed. He would drink of Louey’s pri-
vate bottle, returning the nearly full one to
its owner. In a minute it was done, and
Louey’s wine, Louey’s satanically-brewed
tarantula wine, rested invitingly on the stool
beside Louey’s bed.
It was after midnight . when Louey got
home. Drunk. Very drunk. But not so
drunk that he could not see the bottle of
wine on the stool where he had placed it
against his return. It was to be Louey’s
last great spree. On the morrow, his revenge
satisfied and his son his own again, he would
forswear drink for ever. But to-night—well,
it was a shame to waste it. Rocking un-
steadily on his feet and winking knowingly
at the bottle, Louey lifted and drained it to
the last chop.
