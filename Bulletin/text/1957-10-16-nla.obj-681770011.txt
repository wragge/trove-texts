BEDFORD'S STATELY HOME,
WOBURN ABBEY
'VVT'OBI RN ABBEY, country seat of the Dukes
W of Bedford and one of the great stately
homes of England, stands in twelve hundred acres
ol parkland in Bedfordshire, nine miles from
Dunstable. The estate has been in the possession
of the same family since the middle of the 16th
century, when John Russell (1486-1.553) rose to
high office under Henry VIII, who made him a
baron. Later, in the reign of Edward VI, he was
given the Earldom of Bedford and the grant of
Woburn Abbey.
It was Francis, the fourth Earl, who, in 1626,
fleeing with his wife and children from the plague
in London, reached Woburn and decided to build
a home on the site of the derelict Abbey, which
had been founded in 1145 as an offshoot of
Fountains Abbey, in. Yorkshire. There is now no
trace of the original monastic buildings, but the
existing house, remodelled by the architect Henry
Flitcroft in 1747, almost follows the lines of the
old foundations.
Eighteen of the ninety rooms in this great
mansion are open to the public at certain times,
and here visitors can see the splendid State apart-
ments filled with treasures that belonged to an
elegant and magnificent age. Mantelpieces by
Rysbrack, the panelling of some of the rooms with
damask and Mortlake tapestries, and the richly-
decorated ceilings are only a few of the outstanding
features of Woburn which attract attention.
The Queen s Saloon commemorates a visit of
Queen Victoria in 1844, and is linked to the series
of State reception-rooms, which are of a sumptuous
mid-Georgian character. The series of historical
portraits cover a wide range from the time of
Henry VIII to the present day, and include a
Holbein of Queen Jane Seymour and a remarkable
portrait of the first Elizabeth, symbolising in the
background the defeat of the Spanish Armada.

OLD BUSH SONGS
When Old Bush Songs (an anthology
compiled as a companion to “Aus-
tralian Bush Ballads,” by Douglas
Stewart and myself) was first considered
early in 1952 there was, with the excep-
tion of Dr. Percy Jones in Melbourne,
virtually no one in Australia engaged
in the systematic collection of “folk-
verse.” Nor, since “Banjo” Paterson
edited his “Old Bush Songs” in 1905,
revised in 1930, had any book of it
been published. Today an astonishing
number of people have entered the
field: writers, historians, musicians With
tape-recorders, American Fulb right
scholars.
Possibly an explanation for this
awakened interest is to be found in
the fact that we are now far enough
removed in time to view the colonial
period objectively: we are no longer,
as a nation, ashamed, or even very
much aware (except as a vein for
romance), of the convicts; or exercised
about bushranging, cattle-duffing, gold-
digging, free - selection of land,
squatting, exploring and so forth as
burning political or social questions.
We recognise, without prejudice, that
these bush songs are an interesting
part of our social tradition and an
important part of our literary heritage.
We do not have to be perturbed
about the literary quality of the old
songs—which is sometimes, for all its
simplicity, a very rich poetry of the
Australian earth; and at other times
so crude and naive as to be valued
only for its earthiness —but we can
accept them all as the folk-poetry, the
first authentic voice of this new
continent. Humble as they may be,
these songs are, in a sense, the stones
upon which all the later edifice rests.
As to the intrinsic literary merits of
the old Australian songs, no one would
make very, high claims for anything as
naive as: —
There’s a bloke on the board and I
heard him say,
“I couldn’t shear a hundred sheep
a day,”
But some fine day I’ll show him
the way
And prove I’m ' a ryebuck shearer.
But, on other hand, it is impossible
to deny the authentic poetic nostalgia
of: —
And just now I’m longing to see the
old places,
I’m longing to visit old Sydney
again—
For I’m “full” of the Snowy’s white
hills and wild graces ;
I’m a broken-down digger on
Kiandra plain.
The problem was admirably
summed-up by A. G. Stephens, who,
like the Greeks, so often had a word
for it, and said, writing in “The
Bulletin” in 1901:
Come to the bushman’s rhyme of
today. The songs that are sung in
the huts and on the camps have little
to do with Literature with an L;
but they are often racy, often
graphic, and always close to the
aboriginal emotions.
Of a verse of the folk type Stephens
further says: “That is a piece of verse
to be treasured beyond many of the
prettily-pranked artificialities of our
literary popinjays. Why? Because it
holds the writer’s virile Force: it is
muscular and massive: if rough-hewn
it is hewn from rock . .
As between the true Australian bush
ballad, with a definite story and written
usually later and at a distance from
the events described, and the old bush
song—sometimes telling a tale but
incidentally to its vocal qualities—my
own preference is unequivocally for
the song. As with so many personal
preferences, this “feeling” is difficult
of definition. It is partly a matter of
“atmosphere.”
Farewell and adieu to you, Brisbane
ladies,
Farewell and adieu to the girls of
Toowong:
We have sold all our cattle and
cannot now linger,
But we hope we shall see you again
before long . . .
For the first camp we make is called
the Quart-pot,
Caboolture and Kilcoy, then Colinton
hut;
We pull up at Stonehouse, Bob
Williams’ paddock,
And early next morning we cross the
Blackbutt . . .
and
I’m a broken-hearted shearer, and
ashamed to show my face,
The way that I’ve been treated is a
shame and a disgrace;
I raked a cheque together, and I
thought that it would do,
So I went down to Sydney just to
spend a week or two . . .
and
I once fell deep in love, sir,
In a true Colonial way,
With a German girl who played and
sung,
In the Union bar all day ;
I’d just arrived, was green as grass,
Not badly off for tin.
So this German girl first, drew me
me out!
And afterwards took me in . . .
all have, for me, this kind of
atmosphere. It does not make any
difference that the first is an obvious
adaptation or parody of the old English
sea-chanty:—
Farewell and adieu to you, fair
Spanish ladies,
Farewell and adieu to you, ladies
of Spain,
For we’ve received orders to sail for
old England,
But we hope in a short time to see
you again . . .
or that the second is a piece whose
authorship is quite unknown that was
popularly sung to the air of “The
Wearing of the Green”; while the third
is the product of a witty goldfields
entertainer.
Alongside the bush ballad, too, I
feel more certain of the bush song.
Here there is no possibility of a
confusion of literary values: there is
not the occasional instance of truly
and intentionally poetic writing (as
opposed to almost fortuitous poetic
effect), such as one finds in some of
the balladists —writing which causes
one to wonder: was so-and-so merely
a literary balladist or, perhaps, in
reality a true, if minor, poet whose
gifts were stultified because he made
too easy and convenient use of a
popular form?
I suppose Edward Dyson’s “The
Old Whim Horse” is one of the most
popular of our “ballads of the
’nineties,” and it exactly, in its manner,

SATELLITES AND SENSE
THE Russians have scored early
points over the talkative Americans,
who have been conceded the leader-
ship of the Western world, and that it
is a propaganda rather than an actual
victory hardly matters in present cold-
war strategy.
It also seems to be plain fact that
the science and technical skill and
particular knowledge which made the
phenomenon possible came from the
West, partly from Germany and partly
from one of the ungrateful renegades
who received shelter and were honored
in Western scientific circles and then
sneaked off, prepared to give the
secrets which were not theirs to the
coterie in the Kremlin, whose actions
negate every ideal the mad scientists
profess to embrace.
Now the Kremlin, which professes
to have adopted the dove as its emblem,
peace as its objective and “Ban the
atom-bomb” as its slogan, says, in
effect, that the' satellite is a sort of
last warning to the world that if it
does not knuckle-down to the maulers
of Hungary, the subverters and
armament-suppliers of any country
which is prepared to shed the blood
of those who stand in Russia’s way,
the end is not far off and civilisation
will be blown to bits by courtesy of
Comrade Khrushchev’s inhumanity to
the man who does npt agree with him.
It is a supposed advertisement that
Russia can rule the world at will and
must not be resisted or else.
Khrushchev’s interviews are couched
in the language of the gangster, which
comes naturally to him.
Very little that is authoritative has
been said in the West about the
Russian “moon” save to acknowledge
that it is a very great technological
achievement.
The press has drawn for its advice
on its standard panel of wonder-boys
—the noted experts, anonymous spokes-
men and “famous” scientists, some of
whom are almost as good in the
scientific field as the war-time experts
who used to go into ecstasies about
Russian Cossack regiments which
wiped out whole mechanised German
armies with swords overnight.
Reduced to proper perspective, the
launching of the satellite is not as
significant an achievement as the
splitting of the atom by New Zealand’s
Lord Rutherford, the basic nuclear
work of Cockcroft and others in
England, the development of the VI
and V 2 by the Germans, of the atom-
bomb by the mixed team of Westerners,
or the harnessing of nuclear power on
an industrial scale for the first time by
■the British. It is certainly not as
significant in war as the development
of radar by the British, whose silence
about that important matter is a fine
object-lesson for the Khrushchevs and
their American rivals.
It does not mean that the Western
world has been defeated or need fear
defeat that the Russians, apparently,
have developed a technology in the
field of warlike science which they
certainly had not developed in peaceful
industry if their exhibits at recent
international shows is any guide. What
they have done, however, is a warning
that they have learned to apply modern
technology on a large scale, even if
the basic ideas which they use have
virtually all originated in the West.
Professor Messel has probably put
the matter as accurately as anybody—
he is a trained professional soldier
apart from being a scientist. He
declared that the “satellite had no direct
military significance at present, but its
potential is enormous.” On that every-
body in the military world would agree,
while at the same time nobody would
agree that at the present there is
anything to suggest that it could be a
definitive factor in a world-war.
He said that “the launching of the
satellite has probably made a fighting-
war more improbable by making it
more frightening.” But here his
reasoning probably goes astray, for
there is only one country liable to
make war on the world and that is
now boasting of its ability to beat the
rest with one hand tied behind its
back.
However, the professor returns to
full truth when he says that we must
take action to see that “ballistic inter-
continental weapons of the satellite
family are never used in war by
matching the Russians’ scientific
progress... .Unless we match Russian
technology it will be the end of our
present social and economic structure.”
He is one scientist who has no illusions
about Communst intentions.
The Western world is as rich in front-
rank scientists as Russia —on the
record of the past decade, infinitely
richer. There is certainly no need for
panic on the score of originality in
research and invention. In that Russia
is apt to be the adapter rather than
the originator. But there is no doubt
that the Western world lags in the
output of working scientists, tech-
nologists and engineers in proportion
to its means and needs.
Metal-production, both as to quality
and quantity, is the measure of the
capacity of a country or group of
countries.
Russia, however, makes few of the
amenities of peace. There are fewer
motor - vehicles, for instance, for
peaceful use in Russia than there are
in Canada. There are few, if any,
of the luxuries which Western tech-
nology now provides universally for
the ordinary people refrigerators,
washing-machines, radios, large houses
and apartments and good clothing
reasonably cheap, abundant and varied
food.
Russia is concentrating its science
and technological training on heavy
industry, the basis of war-production,
while starving the rest. And it is
certainly making headway in heavy
industry with only about a quarter of
the metal and fuel production of the
United States and only a small fraction
of that of the civilised West.
Security in the West depends on the
channelling of more technicians into
heavy industry, which is difficult
without reducing standards or the
production of a great many more
technologists, engineers and scientists
in heavy-industry fields in particular.
Also, on a recognition, that at a certain
stage the Russians may be able to
carry the war into the industrial fields
of peace, if we are not ahead of them.
This is an engineering age, but it is
also an age of propaganda in which
sanity is needed in press and public to
withstand the impact of intimidation
and suave persuasion aimed at under-
mining our will to defend ourselves and
to confuse Western thought on defence.
Already this insidious propaganda
emanating from the Kremlin has
become as dangerous as Russian
strength.
Australians in particular have been
quick to adopt the shibboleth that
conventional methods of war are
outmoded because the moment any-
body goes to war with Russia in the
old way he will be blown off the earth
by Russian satellites or H-bombs or
ballistic intercontinental weapons or
something.
There is almost as much danger in
overestimating the military value of
Russian technological attainments as
in underestimating it.


ONE-WAY RIDE
“You first, Khrushchev, of course.”
“No, no —YOU first, Bulganin, I insist.”


PLAIN ENGLISH
The Contrast
In all the flurry of conjecture, combined
with alarm, over Comrade Khrushchev’s
only satellite not acquired by virtue of
Red Army conquest, the other perform-
ances of Russia during the past few
months appear to be forgotten —as,
indeed, is the fact that the new Red
moon was apparently brought to the
point of practice by a scientist who
learnt his nuclear and other physics at
Cambridge under New Zealand’s Lord
Rutherford, aided by modern Western
research.
Every suave interview by Khrushchev
with the American papers, which are
proud to be his first-line of mouthpieces,
is intended as a step towards the under-
mining of the freedom of thfc West. The
head of the Red Army, Marshal
Zhukov, is at the moment touring Yugo-
slavia, his objective subversion of the
Mediterranean countries linked with the
West.
Turkey is being bullied, the United
States accused of attempts to plunge
Syria in 'war, even though it must be
plain that this could not be done without
also plunging the whole world into war.
After the events connected with Suez
this kind of propaganda speaks for itself.
The Scandinavian countries had their
bullying a few months ago. The results
have been evident in the Danish elections,
at which the two or three Communist
members were wiped out, and at the
Norwegian poll last week, when two out
of three Reds disappeared from the
political scene with great suddenness.
Behind all the suavity of Moscow and
eagerness by the Western press to use
Russian sensational propaganda as a
medium to sell papers, irrespective of
the harm done by the slimy propaganda
issuing from Moscow, are the permanent
realities which were stated firmly by Mr.
Macmillan in London last week, though
his voice was scarcely heard above the
excited hubbub of the moon-fans.
He said that Communism had been
checked in Europe and the Far East,
and so was now congentrating on the
Middle East; and though Britain was
ridiculed only a year ago for attributing
the agitations of the Middle East to
Communism, ‘‘few could have any doubt
about the analysis today.”
Only possession of the hydrogen-bomb
(he said) deterred Russia from open
aggression, and so long as we possessed
retaliatory power he did not believe that
there would be a mass-assault by Russian
force, though Russia, thwarted in that
direction, would turn to subversion,
“which we must try to meet in all its
various forms.”
Most of the world’s publicists are
“meeting” it by helping it in some of its
present forms, which are designed to
spread fear and awe of the supposed
Russian supernatural genius that is
almost entirely evident in war-type
projects.
The nation which produced the Red
satellite has not yet found means, of
worried to find means, to feed and clothe
its people according to standards of living
which would have been considered
reasonable in the West a century ago.
It is too busy producing scientists for
war to do more than pay lip-service to
the theory of the Welfare State, which
its agents have been spreading as an
ideal among Western nations with a view
to undermining their will to defend
themselves.
Sport Pays in the A.8.C.!
[From M. F. Dixon!
Another former sporting-commentator,
Talbot Duckmanton, has skyrocketed to
the third-highest administrative post in the
Australian Broadcasting Commission.
Less than 10 years ago Duckmanton was
a rank-and-file announcer and sporting-
commentator in the national service.
Duckmanton’s first job with the A.B.C.
was in its dispatch department, and from
there he graduated to the announcing
staff, with periodical assignments as
sporting-commentator. His first real step-
up came a few years ago when he was
appointed assistant-manager for Queens-
land, but he barely had time to warm that
seat before the managership of Tasmania
came his way. Then followed quickly
a trip to London to assist in the broad-
casting of the Coronation celebrations.
Back home again, he was appointed
co-ordinator of television and broadcast-
ing programmes, which involved another
trip overseas to report on films and other
material offering for national TV. A
few months ago, when the third-highest
administrative post in the commission’s
service, controller of administration,
became vacant, Duckmanton continued
his upward climb by winning it against
a number of inside and outside applicants.
Former occupant of the post, Eric
Sholl, who at one time was also a sporting-
commentator, is transferring to Perth next
month as manager for West Australia.
A knowledge of sport appears to be the
open-door to rapid advancement in the
national broadcasting service. The
general-manager, Charles Moses, who is
now on a six-months’ world tour, joined
the A.B.C. less than 25 years ago as a
sporting-commentator ; and his next-in-
charge, Huck Finlay, was sporting-editor
for N.S.W. when 1 joined the service in
1936. Finlay’s next step was manager for
Queensland ; and soon after his discharge
from the army at the end of World War
II he was appointed assistant general-
manager at head-office in Sydney
The post of controller-of-administra-
tion, which was created about 10 years
ago, is recognised as one of the toughest
in the service. The first holder of it,
A. L. Flolman, retired some years ago
because of ill-health, and was succeeded
by Eric Sholl, then manager for Queens-
land, who also had a distinguished legal
and sporting record.
The Petrovs
[From Canberra!
The “Get Petrov” hunt which E. J. Ward
started soon after the Russian ex-M.V.D.
man and his wife were disentangled from
the espionage royal commission received
a bad setback when it was revealed that
the couple are no longer being maintained
by the Commonwealth.
It has always been Ward’s hope that
some figures would come to light to show
what drain the Petrovs were on Treasury
funds and that these would extend from
1954, when Vladimir Petrov defected,
until now.
Fie has persistently sought the cost to
the Commonwealth of financial grants,
maintenance (including transport), the
provision of guards and the like.
He still doesn’t know the details, but
his main line of attack —that they are
still a charge on the Government —has
failed.
Prime Minister Menzies has informed
him that they are not being maintained
by the Commonwealth.
Menzies pointed out that the infor-
mation supplied by the Petrovs was used
as a basis of attack against Soviet
espionage by most, if not all, of the free
countries. To date they had identified
522 Soviet espionage cadre-workers
throughout the world.
Petrov had proved fo be the most valu-
able single defector-source to have come
out of the Soviet State Security Service
since 1937.
It was in 1937 that the late General
Walter Krivitsky, who had been Chief
of the Red Army Intelligence Service in
Western Europe, defected to the demo-
cratic world.
And as the world will not forget,
General Krivitsky was found shot in a
New York hotel in 1941.
Satellites and Patents
[From Canberra!
Twenty-five applications have been
received in the current year at the
Patents Office, Canberra, for inventions
relating to rockets, guided-missiles and
launching-platforms—but none was for
artificial satellites.
Of the 10,000 applications made so
far during the year, however, a number
The Earth-satellite
Earth’s not been our home yet,
But it could be now.
You’re full of promise, little planet!
Thanks, jugglers, for balancing it there.
All honor. But is this not
A victory all men may share
And, looking upward, grow
Somewhat more affectionate
Toward all on earth here below ?
Could be this metal bead
May provide the extra-
Terrestrial focal-point we so badly need.
Till now earth’s been the earth,
Centre of the Universe;
Perhaps a new conception s had its birth
With this achievement. When we roam
Out there in future, earth won’t be earth
Merely, but o’ur beloved home.

W. HART-SMITH.


were indirectly concerned with communi-
cations, maintenance and manufacturing
techniques involved in sending-up a
satellite.
If satellites aren’t a popular field for
inventions, chemistry and electronics are,
and to such an extent that the Patents
Office gets more work than its 80
examiners can deal with.
Not exactly a satellite or a patent, but
almost as interesting, the Australian
Atomic Energy Commission has arranged
a display in King’s Hall, Parliament
House, featuring a robot which could
easily be mistaken for a Senator.
It is fitted with gadgets and mechanical
parts which will make it react in almost
the same manner as most Senators during
divisions.
It will be interesting to see what it does
when members attend the official inspec-
tion late this week after Prime Minister
Menzies’s opening-speech.
Free Enterprise and A.N.A.
The facts about the demise of Australian
National Airways, Ltd-., as set out by
P. W. Haddy, the former chairman of the
company, must give members of the
Commonwealth Government some un-
easy moments if their “free-enterprise”
consciences are working.
Mr. Haddy says that, after the
Chifiey Government’s attempt to
nationalise A.N.A. was frustrated by
the Privy Council, every route
operated by A.N.A. was given a dupli-
cate T.A.A. service, the latter services
being equipped with machines through
grants of dollars, which were then at their
tightest, while A.N.A. was refused even
sterling, which was then plentiful, to buy
new aircraft.
. The T.A.A. competition was inaugur-
ated even on developmental routes on
which there was not even enough traffic
for a single service, while T.A.A. did little
or nothing to develop new routes, having
only three not previously served by free
enterprise.
Members of the present/ Government
were vastly indignant both at the Chifley
Government’s methods and purposes, and
some of them solemnly pledged them-
selves to undo the wrong when returned
to power. Their indignation was in-
creased by the fact that the T.A.A. had,
apart from unfair advantages, no capital-
structure and no obligation to earn a
profit for anybody.
T.A.A. never has to look for subscrip-
tion of private capital to buy aircraft.
It has no need for reserves —the taxing-
power of the Commonwealth provides
them, and it can invest its superannuation
funds of million in its own business
because of the backing of a Government
guarantee. It has virtually a monopoly of
public-service business, and its offices
were provided by the Government,
through resumption, on most favorable
terms.
In all the circumstances the present
Government has scarcely played the game
with A.N.A. any more than it has with
other partly socialised industries deeded
to it by Labor. It certainly gave back
to A.N.A. an equal share with T.A.A.
of the carriage of mails ; but its reduction,

benefited T.A.A. as well as the private
companies, and the undertaking to give
A.N.A. equal access with T.A.A. to Gov-
ernment passengers and freight on routes
on which both concerns operated never
became really effective ; neither has the
agreement to rationalise services of the
two companies, since T.A.A. has flatly
refused to co-operate, and the Govern-
ment has given its resistance policy tacit
support.
It is true that a loan of £3 million to
buy new aircraft was guaranteed for
A.N.A. by the Government, but this still
left A.N.A. at a disadvantage beside
T.A.A., which did not have to pay bank-
interest on the money it received for the
same purpose froiji the Treasury, or even
think of returning the public money which
it thus acquired.
In fact, all the Government did, as Mr.
Haddy says, appears to have been to make
some half-hearted “patchwork repairs”
to the private-enterprise structure and
continue to pile advantage on advantage
in the lap of the Socialist-line competitor.
Blood-fests Will Tell
Some of the latest statistics compiled by
Dr. John Birrell, the Victorian police-
surgeon, in collaboration with the Vic-
torian police traffic branch, on the effect
of drink on motorists’ driving and judg-
ment, are salutary ; and since most of the
figures relate to the interval between
6 p.m. and 8 p.m., when most accidents
occur, they are also a condemnation of
the six-o’clock swill in Victoria.
A day after Dr. Birrell published his
findings, the Government introduced into
the Legislative Assembly a bill to establish
a 24-hour voluntary blood-test service in
the city, the appointment of a full-time
doctor to the force, and a clause in the
bill enabling courts to accept as evidence
certificates relating to the blood-tests, if
the case is not being contested.
The Government’s bill was belated,
since it has been an open scandal
in courts of petty sessions for years
that the police could seldom get blood-
tests taken in the public hospitals because
it involved the hard-worked medical staffs
in attendance at courts, sometimes for
hours, followed by close cross-examina-
tion by the defence.
Dr. Birrell found that 64 p.c. of road-
accidents were caused by alcohol, which
he described as a greater killer on the
roads than speed.
He devoted four weeks to a survey of
police reports on accidents; and in
those four weeks 70 out of 72
motorists charged with driving under
the influence had been in acci-
dents before they were arrested; and
in the last fortnight of the survey 135
drivers who had been pulled-up by the
police for breaking the law had been
drinking.
The 1955-56 figures showed 582 people
killed and 13,483 injured on the roads,
and, of them, 375 deaths and 8200
accidents were the result of alcohol.
Blood-testing is simple. Except in rare
cases it is reliable and gives the court
a positive fact on which to convict.

“Bannon”: It is customary for visiting
Servicemen to swap items of kit with our
Digs., the main attraction for Yanks
being, of course, Hats Khaki Fur Felt.
The latest beats the band. After a night
out a few young Digs, decided to swap
complete uniforms with some visitors, and
after further fun in town all headed for
their respective cots. About 1.30 a.m.,
Sunday, a group of young soldiers with
a “Yank” in tow were seen by the proper
authority quietly heading for their
barrack-room. The hour being late and
we being host country, the blind eye was
turned, but I would have given quids to
have witnessed the sight of the two Los
Angeles “Digs” trying to establish their
identity as liberty-men to an officer of the

“Digs” were successful, but finished their

London “Encounter.” Blasting middle-

he says there are now “detectable signs

knocked back his month’s quota: “Got

tions to suspending a manned spotlight-

platform ready for hoisting and called in
George, the local-government knowall.
George gave technical advice ; approved
the structure ; even approved the arrange-
ments for suspending—with a few minor
alterations, of course. While the others
hoisted, George ably supervised, and
went home with the praise and gratitude
of the company ringing in his ears.
Being indispensable was his greatest joy ;
he was even indispensable on the council
itself. When the appropriate authority on
the council told Cyril the platform con-
travened certain regulations Cyril looked
up innocently and said, “Oh, that! That’s
George’s idea ; better see him about it!”
The platform is still in use.

AN OVERDUE IMPROVEMENT
Sergeant: “What did he say then?”
Witness: “He gave me a wharfie’s farewell.”
Sergeant: “Not a sailor’s?”
Witness: “No, a wharfie’s —it’s much better.”
When those who’ve toiled on wharf or ship
Hang up their billhooks for the day,
To valedictories they give lip
As mates depart on homeward way.
And rather varied these would be,
With rich use of hyperbole,
And calling on a wide vocabulary,
Full use of which, one rather fears,
Might noj be fitting for the ears
Of sensitive souls in the constabulary.
Crude may be some adieux, and yet
Others could be, oh, quite genteel.
I heard one bloke, departing, get
A most refined: “God speed you >
Neil r
And three big burly blokes who, when
A fellow-wharfie had a yen
To leave (this caused no controversy )
Before his turn came round to shout,
Stand up and bow as he walked out
And cry: “Auf Wiedersehen, Percy!"
Yet might there not be times when those
Who toil on wharf side find the need
To call upon some gem of prose,
Some specially pungent phrase, to speed
The guest who’s worn his welcome out?
Of this.you can’t have any doubt:
They’d mint it without inhibition.
Hot and explosive it would be
Far more than any T.N.T.,
Approaching nearer nuclear-fission.
Who sail the bounding main have coined
A potent, salty-tanged farewell
Which the wide world with glee purloined.
Attention keen it must compel.
But what the jolly sailors do *
In terms of verbiage tinted blue
The wharfies can do better — easily.
Enlisted in the phrase’s ranks
Must be some of the choicest “blanks ” —
Well, wharfies, let us have it, breezily !

FOR MY DAUGHTER
Lie here, my love, and let soft light
Outline your lines to a lover’s sight.
Uncle Charles has a Berkshire boar,
Retrousse of nose, and tail in a coil;
The hot sun shines on his pimpled
back .
And his bristles gleam {with olive oil,
But the gold on his back glows not
more red
Than the curling down of your resting
head.
The gargoyle at the Maori pah
Is a smoothly carved invertebrate,
Lean and long and vermicular.
Its seamy face and its nose dilate
Betray a high intelligence,
Yet it lacks your lambent innocence.
Cool, in a pool of mud all day,
The leech is tubular in form.
It knots and coils in the oddest way,
With none to say if in work or play:
Its curves and swerves show some less
grace
Than those discreet beneath your lace.
Sleep now, my love, your future holds
Splendid lines, and reds and golds;
Splendid form portraying sense,
And splendid years of innocence.

THE TITANIC
A still chill night, a shudder shakes
the ship;
The jarring crush of ice on wood and
steel
Attracts a cautious few, and even these
are calm.
“Ladv, not even God could sink this
ship.”
No fear, but great dismay.
No haste to lower boatloads —ladies
first;
Or ride the ice-chill wave until return
To the Unsinkable.
“Lady, not even God can . . .”
No haste to ride the ice-chill wave;
we know
We shall be back aboard, because —
“Lady, not even God . . .”
“Lady, get the Hell into that boat.”
The glacial digit submarine has floated
on;
Seven hundred symphonies now near
the close —
The tempo of the piece increases; for
the few
A rest until the end. The Lady of the
ocean glides
With unconcern in her majestic plunge
to death.
“Nearer, my God, to Thee,
Nearer to Thee.”
“But, lady . . .”
The baton falls.

TWO POEMS OF VOYAGING
1. Donna Felipa
Donna Felipa Muniz
de Perestrello,
whose dowry was a rock
and a box of maps and manuscripts—
where are you ‘now?
Porto Santo, relic of Atlantis,
outpost in the unknown,
safe refuge, gale-swept islet
where one might dream alone,
Europe behind, Antiilia before, v
an island out of sight of either shore.
The quest in thought and feeling
realised.
The deed itself to do.
If I had known how ill-prepared I was,
would I have sailed?
Fate answers Yes, but even so,
one might have spent one’s life
living it in imagination only.
What titles then?
Not Admiral of Ocean Sea, or Don,
but “babbler” maybe, “eccentric,”
“garrulous one.”
And oh, above all,
Master Christopher, good citizen!
2. The Death of Columbus
That isthmus which he failed to cross
before
he will not traverse now,
for Mercy placed it there to stop his
mind
sailing a Pacific of despair.
Beside his bed a sailor’s chest contains
those relics which revive
his several treacheries, but tears for
these
are other tears than those he sheds for
chains.
You think these iron links bespeak
self-pity?
It is not so. They are
the chains of pride that fettered so his
soul.
Now freed from them he’s found hi*
tloly City.

THE EVOLUTIONARY
The darkness feeds within my mind,
Like a great beast it crops and strays
Upon that scanted pasturage;
Its shadow crosses all my days.
i
The keener arrows of the moon
That fall like sharpened silver rain
Are turned against the monstrous shape
Of darkness brooding in my brain.
And not the brilliant, splintering crack
Of daybreak’s lash upon his hide
Can quicken into brute response
The creature always at my side.
Old brontosaurus-like despair,
Mute monster of a darker age!
How shall I rid me of this beast
And quit me of his lumbering rage?
How make most absolute escape
From fume of Mesozoic slime?
Oh wit be quick, oh thought be sharp,
I must grow wings against the time.

Beyond the impatient tongue impatient
mind

test fact with a rap of hooves in mulish

blind
subservience to the accepted. Yet

seeming unteachable arrogance no
fool flouts
instruction with the instructor when

it up with “They’re all a whole lot of

“You don’t mean that, Gus,” and from
Liberal member Lawrence, an active

withdrawal. Under direction from the

him for a definition of ratbag.

will arrive in Hollandia this week for a
month's inspection tour of all parts of
Dutch New Guinea. Has any invitation
been issued to him to visit the Australian
half of the island? The opportunity for
discussion with administration officials of
problems common to both territories
should surely not be missed.

Speaking at the annual conference of
N. S. Wales health-inspectors Major-
General Dougherty, Director of Civil
Defence, said that our cities would need
more roads in the event of war in order
to be able to evacuate people. In addi-
tion to the dangers of radioactivity the
difficulties of mass-evacuation included
supply of fresh water and food ; provi-
sion of sanitary- and garbage-services;
control of the increased number of
vermin and insects. Country towns
would face the kindred problem of
absorption.
Apart from the uneasy knowledge that
beyond*the appointment of a director
little has been done about civil defence,
the most disturbing thought suggested
by this is that apparently vermin and
insects have a greater survival-potential
than man in atomic warfare.

“Becks”: Sydney’s evening papers
thrust rape, murder and sudden death
off their front pages last week to make
room for the satellite. On Tuesday the
“Mirror’s” poster promised “How to See
Red Moon.” This affected me in two
ways: (a) I handed my fivepence over
to Ezra Norton for the first time in
months and ( b ) I missed seeing the
satellite through following his instruc-
tions. Ezra is no sky-pilot.


Reported that American experts have
now decoded the radio-messages from
the Red Moon. Common men decoded
them long ago. Over most of its orbit
the R.M. says “Beep, beep, beep.” Over
it says “Burp, burp, burp.”

Ansett Transport Industries, Ltd.,
which has acquired control of A.N.A., is
having difficulty in getting complete con-
trol of Butler Air Transport, Ltd., in
which it owns 59 p.c. of the paid-up
capital. Another (anonymous) bidder is
in the market for Butler.

Reg Ansett says that the people respon-
sible for the weekend offer to buy all
the shares in Butler Air Transport are
silly and should be put in the asylum.
What he means is they’re BATS.

Federal Labor has abandoned its
demand for a royal commission on the
St. Mary’s project. Perhaps Dr. Evatt
has remembered what he said about royal
commissions during the Petrov inquiry.
It has also abandoned its plan for a
censure-motion. That would mean open
debate of the reasons for the rise in
costs, which might bring up issues which
Labor has -decided, having done some
fact-finding, that it doesn’t want publicly
aired —such as loaf, pilfering‘and obstruc-
tion, and sabotage by Communist-led
unions supporting Labor in politics. The
latest scheme is for a Parliamentary select-
committee which might be held in
private—but perhaps that will go, too,
when Labor remembers what it has said
about select-committee methods in the
past, not to mention how it has used them
itself, as in the Blain “gold-pass” case.

T. L. Lewis, a 35-year-old farmer from
the Castlereagh district, has been chosen
as Liberal candidate for the N. S. Wales
Assembly seat Wollondilly, formerly
held by Blake Pelly, who retired from
Parliament last month. The Labor party
has also picked a farmer —E. W. Seager,
of Campbelltown, who was the party’s
candidate at the general election last
year, when Pelly retained the seat by
11,675 votes to 6220. There’ll also be
an Independent in the field—M. E.
Sweet, a Picton sawmiller. The by-election
will be held on October 26.

At the Conservative-party conference
at Brighton last week U.K. Defence
Minister Duncan Sandys again made an
offer to America for a pooling of scien-
tific knowledge and research. He said
that because of U.S. refusal to co-operate
in the past the two countries had been
duplicating the efforts of rare scientific
brains. Possibly the unexpected winning
of the satellite race by Russia will con-
vince American leaders that aloofness in
scientific research is an expensive and
risky luxury.
ADULTS SHOULDN'T PLAY WITH THEM. EITHER
It seems Westralian Railways are not
always appreciative of bouquets. In the
proceedings of the recent royal commis-
sion to investigate the workings of the
men in control of the system, a very
unusual endorsement of a letter came to
light. It appears Commissioner R. E. B.
Lee (suspended since the investigation)
endorsed a rail-passenger’s letter of appre-
ciation to the department with a cryptic
“Bulidust.”

With sterling at its highest point since
January, Chancellor Thorneycroft told a
meeting of London bankers and mer-
chants that in the year ahead money
would be “scarcer and more expensive to
get hold of.” Under the policy that moti-
vated the rise in the bank-rate he expected
it to be harder to earn profits and harder
to get wage-increases—but “profits and
wages would be paid in honest pounds.”
The Government’s objectives, now that
dollar-parity had been regained, were “a
sound currency and stable prices at home ;
expanding markets abroad.”
These were objectives, said Thorney-
croft, for which the nation should be
prepared to sacrifice and struggle.

Civilisation is about to descend on New
Guinea. From January 1 there is to be a
capitation-tax of £2 a year on all males
over 18. It was probably thought unwise
to call it a poll-tax for fear some of the
men from the mountains assumed it had
to be paid in kind. As it is the wags are
already calling it the decapitation-tax.

The Rural Committee of the N. S.
Wales Liberal party has urged several
changes in soldier-settlement policy. It
recommends that no farm should be
allocated without a home, or a loan to
build one ; that money should be made
available to enable settlers to improve
their farms and for machinery and
pastures; farm-leases to be convertible
into conditional-purchase tenures ; loan-
repayments to be used to buy more land,
not paid into Consolidated Revenue.
Other recommendations are that resump-
tions should be at a “just price” and that
land under proclamation for settlement
should be limited to the amount that can
be resumed and settled in three years.

Vic. State Savings Bank has announced
a new housing-scheme under which loans
will be made up to two-thirds of the
bank’s valuation, with a maximum of
£4OOO. Interest, varying from 5 } per cent,
to 6| per cent., is on a fixed mortgage
basis, renewable every three years. The
bank has also increased its credit-foncier
limit from £2500 to £2750 and has
advanced £250,000 to the Victorian Gov-
ernment Home Finance Trust.


PERTONAL ITEMS
Passed on in Sydney, at 79, Sidney
McCure, of Angus and Robertson’s
Sydney Book Club, that remarkable insti-
tution started by a number of legal men
•—barristers A. Newham, A. Nugent
Robertson, Julian Salomons, R. Colonna-
Close, J. H. Want, and a few others —
which, over the years, became a famous
meeting-spot for people of bookish
tastes ; William Dixson and Billy Hughes
were regulars; and so were scores of
others, whose names would take a pro-
minent place in a history of the period,
in different fields —artists, writers, medical
men, lawyers, businessmen, politicians.
Sid McCure, who started with A. and R.
as a boy of 14, and retired in 1954 after
40 years in charge of the Sydney Book
Club, knew them all and was the friend
of all.

“D.R.”: We each of us have our own
ideas as to what an archbishop should
be like, but one cannot help feeling that
the Anglican Archbishop of Brisbane, the
Most Reverend Reginald Charles Halse,
M.A., D.D., has most of those traits which
everyone would look for in an arch-
bishop : A keen sense of humor, shrewd-
ness, kindliness, a sense of justice,
wisdom, sympathy and understanding,
learning, and, perhaps most important,
he “shows forth his praise not only with
his lips, but in his life.”
Born in Luton, Bedfordshire, England,
in 1881, he was educated at St. Paul’s
School, London (at the same time as the
late Sir Leslid Wilson, one-time Governor
of Queensland, and Field-Marshal Lord
Montgomery), Brasenose College,
Oxford, and Kelham Theological College.
Ordained in 1907, after serving in two
English parishes he came to North
ARCHBISHOP
Queensland as Warden of the Bush
Brotherhood of St. Barnabas in 1913. In
1920 he founded and became first head-
master of All Souls’ School, Charters
Towers. In 1925 he was appointed Bishop
of Riverina, and in 1943 he succeeded the
Right Reverend J. C. W. Wand as Arch-
bishop of Brisbane and Metropolitan of
Queensland.
He has a great love of young people,
and was one of the prime movers in
bringing the Order of the Comrades of
St. George, the youth group attached to
the Australian Board of Missions, into
being. His see is a large one, but this
76-year-old Archbishop is no stay-at-
home. Typical of his journeyings is the
16-day, 3000-mile tour he has just
concluded. Travelling by plane, train and
car, the Archbishop conducted 24 con-
firmation services and averaged four
‘"talks” a day—63 in all—attended 21
parochial meals, dedicated a church, and
set a foundation-stone for another. Not
bad for an “old fellah.”

“Uramao”: The balance of New
Zealand’s war history will be edited by
Brigadier M. C. Fairbrother, who was the
late Sir Howard Kippenberger’s associate
editor in compiling the volumes already
completed. Instead of an associate-
editor, a small advisory panel will be
appointed to assist the new editor.
• •
Charles W. Brazenor, new director of
the National Museum in Melbourne,
came there from England in 1924 as
“Bones” —officially, osteologist-articula-
tor. He has since been curator of
mammals, and assistant-director. An
affable chap, he tells the story of his
nearly momentuous discovery near Deer
Park, on Melbourne’s outskirts. Bones
were discovered in a deep cavity, and a
geologist who accompanied him to the
scientifically exciting job dated the
deposit at 20,000 years. They dug hope-
fully, and in the prescribed careful style,
but it wasn’t long befoTe they were
brought back to present-day reality by the
unearthing of the teeth of a horse in a
stratum dating from a much more recent
(say a century ago) geological disturbance
of the river-bank.
• •
“Sydneysider”: Alec Chisholm,
journalist and naturalist, is celebrating his
50th birthday—as a contributor to The
Bulletin. Having recollected recently
that he broke into the “Abo.” page as a
youngster of about 17, he went to the
files for the relevant period and searched until
he found his basic par. It appeared on
October 10, 1907, at which time its author was a
b'ush-worker —and already, it would seem, a bird-
watcher of some years’ experience—in the bush
of Victoria.
Since then, Chis has written, under an
assortment of pen-names and his own name,
countless pars and numerous articles in various
sections of The Bulletin ; but, tv ue to parental
AUTHOR-NATURALIST
tradition, he regards that modest firstborn as
the pride of the pack. It gave him a special
kick at the time, he says, because its appearance
staggered an elder brother (who had ridiculed
the idea of anyone younger than himself scoring
in The Bulletin), and, moreover, because
it gained a hearing ahead of other letters on the
subject, which were dismissed in an editorial
footnote.
As might be guessed, the topic of that early
par. was birds. The same topic has engrossed
its author ever since: he has lectured freely
upon it both here and abroad; has written at
least a dozen open-air books and about the
same number of introductions to books by
colleagues; has edited natural-history journals
in three States, served as president of various
natural-history societies, and gained honors
from societies of the kind in various countries.
Among workaday jobs he has edited daily
and weekly newspapers in Sydney and Mel-
bourne, also Who’s Who in Australia (1947); he
now is chief editor of The Australian
Encyclopaedia, the national work of 10 volumes
which is to be published by Angus and Robert-
son early next year.
At present Chisholm is suffering something of
a “hangover”—from surgical treatment for what
is usually regarded as a journalists’ occupational
disease —and so is undergoing the rest-cure in
the Victorian bush where he wrote his first
Bulletin par.

“A.”: Roger White, the 21-year-old
organist and choirmaster who died at
Marley Beach (Sydney) trying to save a
youth from drowning, was a brilliant
musician. He had recently been awarded
a two-year scholarship to the Royal
School of Church Music, and had planned
to leave for England in February. He was
organist and choirmaster at St. Thomas’s
Church, North Sydney ; only two weeks
before his death he had arranged an organ
and choral recital as part of that muni-
cipality’s spring festival.

Calling it a day at the end of the year,
after 44 years in the Westralian public
service, Herbert E. B. Smith, who has
been Public Service Commissioner since
February, 1955. He entered the service -
in 1913, rose through the various grades


until he became Under Secretary for
Lands in 1946, holding that post until
appointed P.S. Commissioner. His term
of office was extended twice pending
Parliamentary approval for the State
Government’s proposed Public Service
Board to replace the present system of
administration by a sole commissioner.
An old 16th Bn, man, he has been a
member of the R.S.L. State executive.
Another of his jobs is that of chairman
of the State Gardens Board, which he
has run as a hobby.

Up Darlinghurst way, at the big
teaching-hospital of St. Vincent's,
Bulletin artist Bill Prior caught visiting
surgeon Sir Russell Brock in action, so to
speak: not actually performing one of
his spectacular heart operations —he’s
done 14 major ones at
St. Vincent’s since he's
been here —but lectur-
ing ; which, taking into
account the place
Brock fills in tUe
medical world, must be
as typical an activity
as any.
He has been in Aus-
tralia at the invitation
of Royal Melbourne
and Alfred Hospitals
and St. Vincent’s Hos-
pital, Sydney; left
Sydney the other day
for Melbourne, will go
from there to New
Zealand, then on to
America. When
Prior sketched him he
was talking about post-
operative lung compli-
cations. The audience
was professional (all
associated, either as
honoraries or residents,
past or present, with
St. Vincent’s), the
language technical, the
opening remarks diplo-
matic. Something like
this: Well, gentlemen,
you probably know as
much about this as I
do, but let’s run
through it again, any-
way, and perhaps we’ll
raise a point here and
there that might be
useful . . .
Sir Russell is 54, and has been sur-
geon to Guy’s Hospital (where he had
been a student) since 1936. He won
the Treasurer’s Gold Medal for clinical
medicine, the same for clinical surgery,
the Golding Bird Gold Medal for
pathology, and the B.M.A. Prize Essay in
1926, and has continued likewise, col-
lecting distinctions, higher degrees, honor-
ary degrees, top-level appointments: to
take a few out of the hat —Jacksonian
Prize Essay, R.C.S., 1935 ; Hunterian
Professor, R.C.S., 1938 ; exchange Pro-
fessor of Surgery, Johns Hopkins Hos-
pital, 1949. He lists his recreations as
“reading, writing, antiquities, and the
topography of London.”
Due in Melbourne late this month,
Lancelot Spicer, chairman- of Spicers,
Ltd., Britain’s largest firm of paper mer-
chants ; with him is his wife, who duriiig
War II ran the Lion Service Club in
London, well known to R.A.A.F. men
serving in the U.K. The Spicers are on a
world tour, and will visit the major cities
here and in New Zealand. The
company, established in 1796 by one
of the present chairman’s ancestors
(who wanted to become a Noncon-
formist preacher but was handicapped
by a speech impediment, so went into
the paper trade instead),- has branches
in Australia, New Zealand, South
Africa and the Middle East, and
holds the Heidelberg printing-machine
and linotype agencies in the Far East.
Lancelot Spicer’s “extra mural” activities
include church # work, prison-welfare

Accountants and of the Chartered Insti-
tute of Secretaries. He has had experience
as a senior executive in various fields,

An unpaid, unobtrusive job was done
well at the Perth Royal Show by former
politician, Geraldton businessman and
farmer, 72-yearv-old Edward H. Hall.
Sitting at the entrance of a tent provided
for lost children, he kept tally of strayed
nursery stock, directed the lost ones
inside, and passed the word on to anxious
parents. Born in Geraldton, he helped a
brother to run a store there, took-up land
outside the town about 25 years ago, and
then established the record of haying
represented his district in both Houses of
the Westralian Parliament, fie went to
the Legislative Council as a representative
of the Midland Province in 1928, and held
the Council seat for 22 years. Then,
when former Premier the late J. C.
Willcock was compelled by failing health
to vacate the Geraldton seat in the
Assembly, Hall won it for the L.C.P.,
thus giving that party the bare majority
needed to form a Government. Long
interested in child welfare, Hall, in 1943,
helped to organise the royal commission
into child delinquency. He has also
served on the board of the Royal Society
for the Protection of Children.

Into the Silence:
In Melbourne, at 68, Robert Cuthbert Grieve,
V.C. As a captain in the 37th Battalion, he
wiped-out, single-handed, two German machine-
gun posts at Messines in June, 1917.
At Birmingham (Eng.), at 77, Lord Bennett
of Edgbaston, who, as chairman of the British
Automatic Gun Board in World War 11, was
responsible for producing the Sten gun. Created
a baron in 1953, in 1940 he became a Con-
servative M.P. at a by-election after the death
of former Prime Minister Neville Chamberlain.
In Melbourne, at. 76, Sir John Behan,
Victoria's first Rhodes Scholar (1904). Lecturer
in Law at Oxford (1907-18), from 1918 to 1946
he was warden ot trinity College, University of
Melbourne.
At Menangle (N.S.W.), at 64, Major-General
Sir Reginald Stanham, who served in the
British Army in War 1, came to Australia in,
1918 as private secretary to the Governor
of N.S.W., Sir Walter Davidson, married a
daughter of Major-General J. W. Macarthur-
Onslow, of Camden Park, transferred to the
Royal Army Pay Corps in 1920, and was
Paymaster-in-Chief at the British War Office
between 1943 and 1948.
In London, at 80, George Goodhafrt.
Adelaide-born, he began work with Elder, Smith
and later became a member of London Stock
Exchange.
In Adelaide, at 60, C. A. W. O'Neill, director
of the Adelaide firm of D. and J. Fowler, Ltd.
In Melbourne, at 74, Leslie F. Aldridge, stud-
master at Kismet Park, Sunbury (Vic.). Horses
he bred won in all nearly £1 million in stakes,
and captured almost every important race
(notable exception, the Victoria Derby).
Among the horses were Lawrence, Pistol, Man-
olive and The Trump (winner in 1937 of the
Caulfield-Melbourne Cup double).
At Wellington (N.Z.), at 52, Hubert Emile
Barber, chief construction-engineer (hydro).
During his quarter of a century’s service with
the Ministry of Works, the Dominion’s major
hydroelectric schemes were brought to fruition,
including the greatest of all, the gigantic Rox-
burgh engineering project. He had been
preparing the larger part of the plans for the
Benmore work on the Waitaki river, a stupen-
dous undertaking to produce 480,000 kilowatts
and having the greatest earth dam in the worlds


ABORIGINALITIES
WHEN the three shearers, clobbered
accordingly and cutting-out their
cheques in Blenheim (N.Z.), heard the
dinner-gong from the bar of the best pub
they presented themselves for more solid
sustenance, but were turned back by the
head-waiter, who tactfully suggested
clothing more in keeping with the reputa-
tion of the house. -Temporary exit of the
trio, to return in faultless evening-dress
for an unimpeded dinner. Moreover,
they remained thus apparelled for the
rest of the spree, not troubling to reclaim
the discarded clothes parked at the out-
fitters’, and it was in the same rigs
that a smaller town up-country knew
them for some time after —in fact, until
How is that , sir ?”
the boiled shirt and tails wore out. Thus
they acquired the sobriquet of “The
Gents.” —“Mossie.”
* *_ * *
“V.G.W.”: I had left two kerosene-tins
of milk outside the dairy. Returning
later to give the milk to the pigs, I found
both tins empty, and Hard Case, my
newly acquired light chestnut, dreaming
contentedly near by, a tell-tale high-
water-mark of milk o’n his chin. He’d
swiped eight gallons at one go! Couldn’t
ride him that day, otherwise he might
have churned it into butter.
“Ophir”: Many men make the vital
error of going to the help of a dog fight-
ing a snake. There is only one way to
help the dog: distract the snake’s attention
and then break its back. To encourage
the dog vocally is dangerous, for it tends
to divert his concentration, the very thing
for which Joe is waiting. Nature has
already taught the dog how to handle the
situation.
* * * *
“Tootroo”: Neighbor came over to
compare notes as we were shifting the
stock from a paddock, denuded by a
terrific hailstorm. “How did you fare?”
we asked him. His reply was a doleful
drawl: “You could flog a flea all over
our place.”
* * * *
“Pallamana”: A hurdle-race for
bullocks was staged 99 years ago near
Wattletree Hotel, a hostelry (long since
departed) in Wattletree Road in the Mel-
bourne suburb' of Malvern, General
unruliness at the “barrier*’ by the 10
starters held up the race for a time. Only
three bullocks completed the course, in
which they had to clear seven hurdles
made from 2ft.-high saplings. Remainder
of the field ran off the course or came
croppers at the jumps. “Jockeys” rode
the animals bareback. Bullybeef was the
winner.
# * %. *
“Sevenelms”: Fifty years ago our local
fire-brigade usually had half-a-dozen
“plum-pudding” hounds dozing on the
footpath. My nephew has just received
from the U.S. a story-book picturing the
hook-and-ladder unit scooting firewards
with a proud Dalmatian riding with the
driver. The local fire-chief, to a question
about these dogs, explained that the
association is primarily equine, as origi-
nally these “carriage dogs” slept in the
brigade horses’ stalls and alerted them
when a call came. In the U.S., though
more distant in time than Australia from
horse-drawn firefighters, they nevertheless
maintain Dalmatians in their fire-depart-
ments as a sentimental tradition.
* * * *
“Noore”: Tom says his new sheep are
too plain. “Not enough belly-wool to
fill a gin’s stocking.”
* * * *
“Harbel”: The abo.’s method of making
fire by twirling a stick on a piece of dry
wood is the simplest of operations—to
read about. I tried it, with the slight
assistance of an electric-drill. A stick
of wood in the chuck, its other end
roughly pointed and placed in a shallow
hole bored in a scrap of dry Oregon, I
started the drill. Soon smoke wisped
from the revving point. I filled the hole
with paper and thin shavings, and drilled
on. More smoke, but no fire —not even a
smoulder. After eight minutes there was
a very fine sediment, like black sawdust,
in the hole, a beautifully polished mush-
room-shaped end on the stick ; no fire.
That drill’s speed being 500 revs, per
minute, the stick had revolved 4000
times. Now I’m wondering whether any-
body has actually seen fire made by the
method, or is it another Indian rope-
trick?
* * * *
“Tabba”: After three inches of rain
the bush road was a quagmire ; wagging
along like a tipsy snake, the car took
all my skill to keep it on the raised crown.
I braked as I saw something stir in the
mud right ahead ; it was a big blue king-
fisher bogged just where my offside wheel
would pass,. With his cold blanket of
muddy feathers hunched around him he
looked the most miserable bird I’d seen,
and when I tried to pick him up he put a
bill like a steel grab into action. I offered
him my boot, and while he nibbled the
toe, I got him, washed him in a roadside
drain, and dried him off. He didn’t seem
to be injured ; how then did his anti-
wetting feather-mechanism fail?
* * # *
“Pingo”: Pardon me, “Splodger” (B.
18/9/’57), but the one-horse tip-dray did
have a brake. Set at the back —so that in
lifting the load with the rising movement
of the wheel the levering force was as
much minimised as it would have been
aggravated if set in front to take the
downward movement —the brake was not
the quickly applied foot-brake type, but
the wagon type, which needed a fair
amount of hand-turning to bring it into
operation. The load was always a bit
“heavy on” to overcome any tendency to
tip backwards ; the saddle of the dray-
harness was a massive thing that ensured




the wide spreading of the load on the
horse’s back. Normally the breeching, a
good four inches or more in width, took
the load on the downhill track, and the
huge buttocks of the typical dray-horse
looked fully capable of holding the load
against any force of gravity. For steady-
ing a restive horse while the load was
filling, that brake was a safeguard, and
on a steep downward pinch a nice adjust-
ment of the brake would share the load
equally between the saddle and the breech-
ing, and so reduce the chance of the onset
of stringhalt.
• * * *
“Abi Tonus”: For population and
proximity to the Equator, Port Moresby
must have the greatest proportion of white
residents without hats. Add in those who
also expose the greater part of their body
to direct sunlight day after day,
and the amount of skin-cancers
they are storing up for themselves
is really frightening. Skin-cancers
constitute a large proportion of all cases
of sickness in Queensland, even though
people there take much more care of
themselves than do those in Port Moresby.
And it is safe to bet that the person who
derides the effect of the sun has never
seen an advanced neglected case.
“Kaydee”: The oxalis which Nancy
Cato refers to (B. 2/10/’57) as soursob in
its South Australian habitat is known in
Victoria as soursops. Sops was the name
given to bread-and-milk or broth, or any-
thing soft eaten by children—and children
often ate oxalis. Name-variation such as
this, however, is not uncommon. “Prickly
Moses” is a corruption of prickly mimosa,
and the children’s game “Here we go
gathering nuts in May” was originally
“knots in May,” knots being old-
fashioned English for bouquets of flowers.
“You don't expect your mother and me to take you along in that rigout!"
“Reb”: D’Arcy Niland (B. 25/9/’57)
suggests that “shiralee” could be either of
Irish origin (“It sounds Irish”) or a cor-
ruption of a foreign phrase. As a shiralee
is a swag —also known as a “bluey”—l put
it that the word is a corruption of the
Latin cceruleus, meaning blue.
* * * *
“Kelms”: A grey teal, banded about
100 miles north of Perth, has been shot
in North Queensland, and the flight—
the points are over 2000 miles apart,
straight-flying—is being claimed as a
record. I’d say it was only one stage in
what was intended to be a much longer
flight. Banding in Australia is vigorous
and progressive, but it hasn’t been going
long enough to give a clear picture of bird-
movement. Still, some sort of a pattern
seems to be emerging, at least as far as
the duck tribe is concerned. A teal banded
at Darwin was shot 12 days later at
Meekatharra in inland W.A., about 1400
miles away; another Darwin duck
reached Cunnamulla, on the S.A.-
Queensland border ; one banded at Mil-
dura flew to Darwin and one from
Griffith (N.S.W.) graced a table at Man-
durah, south of Perth. It’ll take more
data than that to give a pattern, but it
suggests that the duck family, particularly
teal, are wanderers, following rain and
feed rather than any inherited route, with
the entire continent their stamping-
ground.

“Macquarie”: At last the industrial
chemist and inventor are being welcomed
to that erstwhile most conservative of
industries, the building-trade. Cement-
mortar (cement and sand without the addi-
tion of lime) was once hard and slow to
use because of its inelasticity ; today a
patent compound similar in appearance to
powdered-milk can be added in the meagre
proportion of an eggcupful to a bag of
cement, and the resultant mixture is as
creamy and “fatty” as any brickie could
wish for. Lumping tiles up ladders is out
—the modern tiler can use a conveyor ; a
cottage-size one is not much heavier than
a ladder and is powered by car-batteries.
Several patents make the fixing of bolts
into brick or concrete walls a simple and
immediate operation, without cement and
consequent drying-time. And now from
Western Germany comes the super-nail
which can be driven directly into a brick
or concrete backing. Case-hardened, it is
fitted into a tube with a protruding
piston; the piston is struck with an
ordinary hammer and the nail is driven
home. Kipling’s “There is little change
in the building-trade” is as outdated as
cedar plugs.
LAST POEM IN AUSTRALIA
Eucalypt scent disperses in blue smoke.
Tree-shadows stretch into the afternoon;
Under this clear, half-wintered sky,
Breaks but the steep gears of a truck,
hauling
North out of the town, out of the valley.
To the man walking that road my hillside
smoke
Signs life among the trees, as he for me
Is patterned at this distance with the land,
Who daily perhaps passes me in streets
Unnoticing, unnoticed. So now the town
Heavy with sunlight on its yellow leaves
Becomes, in beauty, a place unknown to
me.
Always the present blurs with opulence —
This rough slope with its fierce, gesturing
gums
Living and dead, its rocks and stubble
grass
Burned brown by sun and frost, its sagging
wires
Strung out with brilliant parakeets like
beads ;
And smoke dissolving up where whip-
birds wait
To crack the silence, while the black soul
of a crow
Flaps on slow wings into the downward
sun.
Only what lies behind falls into shape,
Orderly, quiet—and is not the truth.
Two years that hovel town has weathered
me
(Neither here nor there, neither alive nor
dying );
Now on its fringing hills, close to
departure,
I grant it, in this autumn afternoon,
That grace which nothing owns except in
loss.

ACCORDING to pundits in the Vic-
torian Wimmera two omens combine
to point to drought conditions: the sight
of the aurora australis on three occasions
within a few weeks, and the fact that
swans in the district have laid no eggs
this spring. The birds laid none in 1938
and 1944, both exceptionally dry years.

“Mowree”: “Eureka” (B. 11/9/’57) is
right when he expresses doubt about
Moree (N.S.W.) meaning in abo. lingo
“a spring.” It is doubtful if the abos had
any knowledge of the artesian water
nearly 3000ft.' underground; and there
isn’t a natural spring within 30 miles of
the town. As a matter of knowledge to
the old pioneers, Moree, in the Kami-
laroi tongue, meant “rising sun.” The
late John Cameron, the first Mayor of
Moree, cOuld speak the language like a
native, and thought no better recognition
of the abo. word’s meaning could be
recorded than by adopting the symbol as
the council’s seal; this was done, with
the addition of the waratah—the colony’s
national flower. My father, who came to
Moree in the ’sixties, knew the Kamilaroi
tongue as well as Cameron, and in their
day no one would question these two old
pioneers’ knowledge of the language of the
local blacks. The town’s seal remains a
tangible record of the meaning according
to the local tribe.

on the edge of the wings, but these can’t

MANGANESE IN W.A.
/ F '\VER the last 12 months Western Aus-
tralia has seen a mineral-rush com-
parable to the great gold-rushes of the
’nineties, but because the mineral lacked
gold’s romantic associations the drama
of this rush has hardly been noticed.
The mineral is manganese, and the
finds could do more for Western Aus-
tralia than gold has done. Like the gold-
finds, they’ve been made in semi-desert
country, and, like gold, manganese has
a ready sale both at home and abroad.
But manganese has the advantage that
there’s a use, and a vital use, for every
ounce of it. It will help to build Aus-
tralia’s heavy industries, and if the finds
are half as good as they look it could
bring in considerable dollars —immedi-
ately. There’ll be no question of digging
it out of one hole in the ground and bury-
ing it in another.
Western Australia is the only State in
the Commonwealth that has commercial
deposits of manganese, and because of its
comparative scarcity and its vital role in
steel-making, electric-battery production,
and more recently in the production of
atomic power, the Commonwealth Gov-
ernment has prohibited its export except
under special licence, which is granted
only when production and reserves of
ore indicate that Australia’s own needs
are not endangered.
This export ban has provided the in-
centive for an intensified search for man-
ganese. The price in Australia is be-
tween £l2 and £l4 a ton, f.0.b.; the pro-
ducers can get £2l a ton f.o.b. from
foreign sources, and the demand is prac-
tically unlimited ; but to be able to export
they must be able to show big reserves of
ore. They believe they’ve done that now,
after one of the biggest prospecting
battles in Australia’s history.
It began last year when a chap at
Mt. Sydney, about 200 miles south-east
of Port Hedland, found an extension of
an ore-bod} that’s being worked near
there, pegged a claim at Skull Creek, 30-
odd miles from Mt. Sydney, and notified
a company interested in the mineral.
Another big company heard of the find,
and the two rival groups began a leap-
frogging prospecting-drive which revealed
a very extensive series of outcroppings in
a line roughly from Mt. Sydney south-
west towards Balfour Downs homestead.
All fold, in about three months 200
mineral claims were pegged.
Since then money has poured into the
area. Roads have been built, machinery
carried and installed; and production
will start any time now.
But that’s just the beginning. There are
manganese deposits in Western Aus-
tralia which have been worked during
the past few years. One is at Mt. Sydney,
in the Pilbara district; the other is at
Peak Hill, roughly 400 miles away.
The new finds are practically in
a line between them, and extending a
considerable distance. The big question
now is, do the outcroppings extend over
the whole of that 400 miles? In other
words, has Western Australia got one of
the biggest deposits of this vital mineral
in the world?
That’s the sort of question on which
the fate of a nation could hinge. And
the answer to it is being sought to the
accompaniment of complete silence in
the daily press.

A HEAVY SHAKING
nnHE year 1957 started-off on
the Stock Exchange with
investors, as predicted here at
the beginning, in a “vigorously
selective” mood. But after half
the year had run selection had
developed into bonus-issue
mania. Yields were forgotten,
and even the Bank of N.S.W.
was rumored to be thinking of
capitalising its share-premium
reserve. Though this js a
comparatively small reserve,
the rumor, apparently un-
founded, had the effect of
running the shares up to nearly
£42. At this figure the yield
was still more presentable than
in most other cases, but it was
market speculation, not invest-
ment strength, which sent the
scrip to that peak.
TTie bonus-issue bellbird led
speculators into strange country
indeed. So far British Tobacco,
Mercantile Mutual Insurance,
Colonial Sugar and B.H.P.
have “gone-off,” but without
any appreciable income
advantage in the two last-
mentioned cases. A.C.l.’s
figures for 1956-57 were down
slightly, suggesting to the
prudent that the time was not
considered by the board to be
ripe for increasing dividend-
commitments through bonus-
increased capital. Henry Jones
has already given a shake of the
head that should have been
obvious to anyone.
As is usual in these cases,
a combination of factors was
responsible for the reverse in
the market that began in earnest
on September 24. Low yields
offering in Australia, higher
interest-rates overseas, drought
threat, lower wool-prices, more
competitive trading in Australia
and overseas all, plus a
normal reaction from over-
speculation, combined to give
the market a severe jolt indeed.

On October 10 and 11
there was a tendency for the
market to steady. But at
525. 6d., ex Is. div. and still
cum bonus-issue, B.H.P. was
down 6s. (or ss. net) on the
Sept. 18 price, and 7s. 6d.
(6s. 6d.) on the year’s peak.
The crash in A.C.I. was even
greater—from 675. to 575.
Most of this fall can be attri-
buted to previous overpricing.
Tooth has dropped 55.,
though the yield of 5.4 p.c. is
now favorable compared with
that offering from B.H.P.
(3.8 p.c.). Burns Philp (595. on
Oct. 10) has fallen ss. 6d., with
the yield still only 3.5 p.c.;
Henry Jones slipped 35., to
yield 3.3 p.c. C.S.R. fell £4;
Bank of NrS.W. dropped
£4 12s. 6d.
Woolbroking concerns, with
the emphasis now on dry
pastoral conditions and the
price of wool down somewhat,
suffered comparatively heavy
falls. From a smaller peak
Goldsbrough, Moit dropped
ss. 3d., Winchcombe, Carson
ss. Master - butchers F. J.
Walker and Co. slid 3s. 9d. (ex
div.), Tancred Bros. 4s. 9d.
A.R.C. Industries slipped
from 31s. 9d. to 295. 3d.,
Cyclone from 31s. 6d. to 30s.
Both these concerns have had
record years.
Reichhold shares have dipned
from 265. 6d. to 245. The
market was a little disap-
pointed with the year’s result.
A crash from 545. 9d. to
475. 6d. has occurred in price of
Australian Cement. The dip in
Kandos has been smaller—
from 48s. to 445. 3d.
Steady after recent rises was
John Mcllwraith Industries,
still yielding 5.6 p.c. G. J.
Coles and Woolworths, among
a number of retail stocks,
showed little variation during
the very severe shaking-out.
The sharemarket has
undoubtedly taken a severe jolt
in a short time in Australia —a
jolt that was justified in the case
of some of the market-leaders
where yields, present and
prospective, had fallen to a
miserably low level.
As The Bulletin pointed
out just before the big shake
occurred, too many people
were “living on the market,”
not basing their expectations on
dividend-yields; and such
boom conditions were bound to
burst.
The bursting has now been
in process for three weeks, and
"I'll be back when the thirty minutes are up."
the pieces have by no means
sorted themselves out.
Inactive stocks take longer
t<> go up and down than the
leaders, and second-line shares
have been following a course
of their own. The sorting-out
take time; some
June 30 balance-sheets are not
yet to hand.
Particular stocks, like the
woolbrokers and F. J. Walker
and Tancreds, are thought by
the market to have had their
prospects directly affected by
wool-prices and drought.
At the same time, drought
and wool-prices are expected
to have a general but less severe
effect over the whole economy ;
while sharemarket support
from the pastoral areas is
expected to show a sharp
reduction.
The investor, in the circum-
stances, will therefore be wise
to buy shares on their
individual merits, and to take a
lesson from the difficulties into
which the elusive bonus-bell-
bird has led the more specula-
tive spirits supporting the
boom market of a month ago.
The background to Aus-
tralian industry continues to be
one of great expansion; but in
that expansion capital, and
particularly overseas funds,
will remain at a premium, and
it would seem foolish, in the
circumstances, to accept too
low a yield on capital invested j

[From 1,. OwenJ
T ATEST press-release from
Wapet reports that Lear-
mouth No. 1 well, on Exmouth
Gulf, was drilling ahead at
4160 ft. in dark grey siltstone.
The previous weekly report
gave the depth at 1280 ft., so
that the rate of deepening has
been above 400 ft. a day—a
creditable performance, even
for “slim-hole” drilling.
It is unfortunate, however,
that the petrographic descrip-
tion of the stratum (“dark grey
siltstone”) at 4160 ft. has so
little significance—a matter
probably due to lack of cores.

In my opinion—and I am
nor alone in it —coring is a
“must” on a site such as this,
which “was selected to evaluate
new geological interpretations
of the Exmouth Gulf area.”
On the meagre information
available, the siltstone is
possibly a member of the basal
Cretaceous “Winning” group,
of which the Birdrong sana-
slone is the lowest bed. If that
assumption is correct, it should
be confirmed very shortly by
onlling. On the other hand, it
is probable that the well was
already in the Jurassic at
4160 ft.
In that case, the bit will be
below the Birdrong sandstone
horizon, and it is remarkable
that the event has not been
reported. Its absence in Lear-
month 1 might be due to a
number of causes —non-deposi-
tion, change of facies, con-
temporaneous erosion or cut-
ting-out by faulting, for
instance.
Geophysical-survey data are
not, usually, a reliable guide for
differentiating between such
causes, particularly where the
sub-surface structure is as
complex as it is known to be
iii the Exmouth Gulf area.
Adequate cores, however,
particularly when coupled with
properly carried-out intensive
outcrop-research, can give very
valuable information.
In its latest “News Digest,”
Wapet is rather belatedly stress-
ing the importance of the field-
geologist in oil-finding. Suc-
cessful correlation between out-
crop and core, and the adapta-
tion of such correlation
to the elucidation of tectonic
history as it affects the search
lor petroleum, demand long
oilfield experience and a degree
of patience which it is rare to
encounter in today’s young-
man-in-a-hurry.
N.Z. Forest Products
IUEW ZEALAND Forest
1 ~ Products’ four-year
expansion plan is now expected
to cost up to £5 million. An
earlier estimate was £4 million.
The chairman of the com-
pany, Sir David Henry, return-
ing after six months in Europe
and North America, announced
that the first instalment of the
programme will be a £2-million
project consisting of a paper-
pulp bleaching-plant to pro-
duce white kraft-paper, a plant
to produce chlorine, the chief
bleaching chemical, and a
glazed-paper-making machine.
This part of the scheme will
be in operation early in 1960.
With the new bleaching
equipment, Sir David said, up to
£1 million a year would be
saved in overseas exchange. At
present the company was con-
cerned with filling N.Z. require-
ments for bleached paper. Once
this was done, overseas markets
would be exploited.
When completed, the £5-
million programme would
increase the company’s produc-
tion by 12,500 tons a year to
nearly 40,000.
The white paper at present
being imported could be satis-
factorily produced in N.Z.
from radiata pine, if it were
bleached, Sir David said.
“Now the company has
decided to install a chlorine
plant, it will become steadily
more interested in the produc-
tion of all sorts and weights
of bleached paper,” he said.
“Both internal and export
trade will have to be exploited
to the utmost. The Government
has granted us a licence to
provide for the fullest expan-
sion of the pulp-and-paper
industry, and that is what we
aim to do.”
Tasman Paper
TV/fOST of the Tasman Pulp
and Paper Company’s
teething-troubles at Kawerau
mill have now been overcome,
according to the director of
operations, L. S. Dougal.
The big newsprint machine
has been running above rated
capacity periodically over the
last few months. The machine's
record daily run produced 242
long tons of paper—about 20
tons above rated capacity. The
co. hopes it will produce close
to its rated annual capacity of
75,000 tons of paper next year.
Newsprint produced by the
machine has been tested suc-
cessfully on Australian high-
speed presses printing 57,000
copies an hour.
Plant producing sulphate
pulp for export is running
from five to 10 tons above
rated capacity daily.
The company, now the largest
N.Z. exporter of timber to
Australia, is reported to have
made good progress with pro-
duction and sales, considering
the restricted market at present.
It is generally considered,
however, that, in spite of the
progress made, the company’s
accounts for the current year
are certain to show another
loss.
It has been confirmed that
Albert E. Reed and Co., Ltd.,
London, which originally held
£1.5 million, or 25 p.c., of
Tasman Pulp’s share-capital,
last year increased its holding
by buying a “relatively small”
quantity of additional shares
on the open market. This
buying-up no doubt helped to
hold the shares at a premium.
Recently they have been down
to 18s. 6d. (N.Z.).

Faith in th e
Future
A man-made satellite is projected around the
Earth in this year, 1957, and people scan the skies
in renewed wonder at what the age produces.
It is an occasion for wonder, but not, I believe,
for fear—provided we are able to see the material
marvels of our time as a challenge to Man’s ability
to match them in spiritual belief.
“To believe with open eyes”: that is the
essence. And let our belief be simple in this
complex world. Personally, I have never been
able to see any real conflict between science and
religion; between the continual revelation of what
physically surrounds us, and belief in an Infinite
God as the Author of it all.
And I am convinced that many of the
problems of our civilisation will be solved when
men have the humility to acknowledge" that
enormous truth,
At the same time,- the launching of
instrument-laden satellites points up for us the
rapidity with which human progress is racing. It
can serve to remind us, here in Australia, of the
danger that lies in “habits of thinking.”
It is easy to fall into a rut of living; to avoid
thinking of things that are different or disturbing
or even uncomfortable: easier still to imagine that
we can be carried along on the tide, and that the
mere passage of time will necessarily operate in
our favour.
But if everyone were to stand aside on the
assumption that the world is going to be a better
place as the result of others’ work, there would be
no progress; only deterioration and backwardness.
In the context of these times, of all they have
produced and that will follow from this again, the
tesson stands plainly before us:
A higher standard than ever is going to be
•equired of us: nationally and individually, as
guilders of a continent; and that implies not only
but a strong determination to get on with
he many works which should go hand-in-hand

discount when it pays the
investor p.c. on the face-

It was emphasised here that
8.3 p.c. was not out-of-the-way
from finance-companies; in
fact, the investor could sell his
bond on the Stock Exchange
and invest the £9O elsewhere at
a rate of interest better than
8.3 p.c.
In all cases, of course, the
investor should make perfectly
sure of the security behind any
such investment, and should be
satisfied with nothing less than
an up-to-date balance-sheet and

indicates the necessary security.
National Minerals Holdings
YV7HILE the almost complete
collapse of the “spot”
market for Australian rutile has
blighted the hopes of several
newcomers to the beach-mining
industry, well-established pro-
ducers, holding firm contracts
for future deliveries, continue
to prosper. National Minerals
falls into the latter and more
fortunate category, but the
sharemarket, which priced its
ss. ords. at 30s. 9d. a year ago,
currently offers only 13s. lOd.
for the scrip.
Formed early in 1956, the co.
exchanged 605,535 ss. shares
for the paid capital of National
Minerals, Ltd., which has been
successfully mining rutile,
zircon and monazite fin the
Newcastle area) for almost 10
years. A second and smaller
subsidiary. Beach Mining (Aus-
tralia) Pty. operates near
Wollongong (N.S.W.).
Last term (to June 30) the
operating cos. produced
approximately 7300 tons of
rutile and a similar quantity of
zircon, roughly 20 p.c. above
the previous term’s effort.
However, plans for a further
increase in production have
been suspended in view of the
state of the rutile market, and
output over the next two years
is likely to remain at the present
level unless further contracts
can be obtained or there is an
improvement in the “spot”
market.
Reflecting the higher pro-
duction figures the consolidated
net profit jumped from
£140,047 to £183,714 after pro-
viding an extra £23,035 for
taxation (£91,801) and £46,364
(up £34,299) for depreciation
and amortisation.
Following an initial 25 p.c.
(tax-free) distribution for the
four months to June 30, 1956,
the co. sent out divs. totalling
80 p.c. from last term’s earn-
ings—Is. 6d. of the 4s. div.
being tax-free.
The balance-sheet shows
total liabilities of £197,663 and
current assets of £75,510, but
amounts on deposit and in
Commonwealth loans, deben-
tures and mortgages are lumped
together at £201,552 under
investments which, with

A.N.A. Postmortem
/COMMENTING on the
remark made by Senator
Paltridge, Minister for Civil
Aviation, that the net value of
T.A.A. assets was £3.5 million
more than those of A.N.A.,
and that formation of a
holding-co., as proposed by
A.N.A., would have meant
“destruction of competition
and creation of a monopoly,”
P. W. Haddy, former chair-
man of A.N.A., said that what
Senator Paltridge did not
mention was that A.N.A.’s paid
capital was £1.5 million,
whereas T.A.A.’s capital-
advances from the Treasury
amounted to £4,370,000.
Mr. Haddy said that when
T.A.A. required further money
for aircraft it obtained the
necessary funds from the
Treasury not as a loan but as
additional capital.
Had T.A.A. been forced
to find finance on the same
basis the value of its assets
would have been similarly
reduced, said Mr. Haddy. He
added that A.N.A. had not
received a fair share of Gov-
ernment business where services
were comparable.
Senator Paltridge later stated
that A.N.A. had borrowed
£1,500,000 from the Com-
monwealth Bank in loan
No. 1, the same amount from
the same source in loan No.
2, and £1,350,000 from the
A.M.P. Society in loan No. 3.
In loan No. 1 £600,000 was
outstanding and £150,000, plus
interest, was overdue.
In loan No. 2 £1,019,000 was
outstanding and £150,000, plus
interest, was overdue.
In loan No. 3 £1,350,000
was outstanding, of which
£135,000, plus interest, was
overdue.
The total value of A.N.A.’s
assets was substantially in
excess of the amount of the
loans still outstanding, said
Senator Paltridge.

SHOWS
Stage and Music
“La Boheme”
Puccini has a lot to answer
for. If he hadn’t set Henri
Murger’s novel to music there
would probably never have
been a modern movement. His
music glorified the characters
in Murger’s novel out of recog-
nition and elevated Mimi from
an ordinary streetwalker to a
beautiful, pathetic creature
with a voice like an angel.
As for those ineffectual
no-hopers, Rudolph the poet,
Marcel the painter, Schaunard
the musician and Colline the
philosopher, they were similarly
transformed by the magic of
his music. Instead of expres-
sing themselves in bad poetry
and worse pictures, Puccini
made them express themselves
in magnificent song. It is these
creations of Puccini which
modern young men emulate
when they go round in velvet
trousers, beards and scarlet
berets and starve in garrets,
deeming themselves to be
artists without bothering to
paint pictures, learn an instru-
ment or write a poem.
These thoughts were more-
or-less thrust upon one in
listening to the current excel-
lent production of the opera
by the Elizabethan Trust at
Melbourne Princess. It was
even better if one shut one’s
eyes to the proceedings on the
stage and merely, hearkened to
the music. Max Worthley as
Rudolph, Neil Easton as
Marcel, Alan Light as
Schaunard and Neil Warren-
Smith as Colline were reason-
ably good, and Joy Mammen
as Musetta was quite charm-
ing, but Elsie Morison as
Mimi was as near perfection
as it is possible to be in this
world. Her melodious sobbing
turned self-pity into a shining
virtue, and her demise was a
tragedy not to be endured.

Ricci and Woess
American violinist Ruggiero
Ricci, soloist in the Mendels-
sohn Violin Concerto with the
Sydney Symphony Orchestra
under Kurt Woess, brought a
beautiful singing tone in the
andante to this most lyrical of
all the works in the form, and
a technique which smoothly
negotiated the lavi s h by
embellished material.
The symphony was the
Tschaikowsky Fourth, that
curious mixture of joy and
despair. Woess made the Fate-
motif by the wind-section in
the opening bars strongly
portentous, going on to an
effectively theatrical develop-
ment. The slow section was no
better than it should be —the
over-repetitious second subject
is none-too-inspired. But he cer-
tainly gave full value in the
scherzo, the work of the three
choirs—strings, woodwind and
brass, separately and in concert
- -being quite worthy of the
charming material. In the
emotionalism of the final move-
ment the brasses supplied a
highly effective and melo-
dramatic touch in the
recapitulation of the opening
fanfare.
Contemporary Austrian com-
poser Theodor Berger supplied
the “Rondo Ostinato on a
Spanish Motif” —a combina-
tion of squeaks, howls,
screeches, snarls and yawps
bent into rhythmical form.

“The Lady’s Not for Burn-
mo”
ing
Ever since the war, poets and
playwrights have been warning
us not to expect too much from
politics, or all those dreary
schemes the planners and the
economists churned out during
the war. They have dinned into
us the lesson that purely
secular objectives are shallow
and do not touch the deeper
problems of life. All very
salutary—especially in Aus-
tralia, where the secularists
looked like imposing their own
brand of conformity.
But anyone tilting at the
planners, or the secularists,
must have something to say ;
and that is the trouble with
Christopher Fry’S “The Lady’s
Not For Burning”: the writer
had nothing to say, except a
few platitudes about toleration,
resignation and mystery. So
he has used all his verbal gifts
and tricks —the similes, the
metaphors, puns, plays on
words —to conceal the underly-
ing nihilism.
Canberra Repertory did their
best to bluff the audience that
there was something there —
the play was effectively
mounted and the players were
marvellously dressed. There
was one almost breathtaking
error in acting when Bernard
Freedman hammed the part of
the Mayor with such devotion
that it looked as though only a
miracle could save his scenes.
Still, the others did well,
particularly Bob Brissendon,
Harold Schmidt, Jocelyn Juliff,
Terence Juliff, Nita Park and
Graeme Hughes.
Ric Throssell, as Mendip,
was the test-case for Fry.
Throssell was playing the
central role in the play:
Thomas Mendip, who has had
all the experiences, all the
moods of mankind from joy to
anguish, from delight to disgust.
And, of course, Fry wants the
woman to show Mendip that
love can convert the most hope-
less case of life-denial to life
affirmation. And if this were
so —if Fry could show this to
us —that would be something.
But it is simply not there, and
all Throssell’s talent and
sympathy and compassion
could not conceal the nothing-
ness behind the verbal deluge.

Jean Derrin
In a good many of Jean
Derrin’s watercolors at Sydney
Grosvenor Galleries the tech-
nical effort, made more diffi-
cult by trying to cope with a
trip to England, seems to have
become the painter’s chief con-
cern, at the expense of mood
and feeling. It is the most
estimable of faults; but the
resulting watercolors are some-
times flat, sometimes too
meticulous, an d sometimes,
even allowing for the softer
English light and colors, pretty-
pretty.
Nevertheless it is an attractive
exhibition and marks a con-
siderable advance. Previously
it was always obvious that
Jean Derrin was a pupil of
G. K. Townshend ; now, though
doubtless his example still helps
her with the clean washes and
the effects of massed foliage,
the influence is imperceptible.
She has felt most free to
capture a fleeting mood in the
delightful group of very small
paintings, such as “A Soft Day,
Sussex,” “Pool Near New-
bridge” and “Stream at West
Ashling”; but sometimes she
has also been able to preserve
this freshness over a larger
area, as in “A Kent Farm” and,
especially, “Perthshire Lane.”

Melbourne Invasion
A lively and compact show
by some Melbourne painters
invading Sydney makes it
worth while to visit even so
hopelessly suburban a locality
as King’s Cross.
The painters correspond,
roughly, to the Contemporary
Group in Sydney, being at
once experimental and reason-
ably solid.
The solidity comes from
such long-established prac-
titioners as Arnold Shore
(silver light through the bush)
and William Frater (a very nice
piece of hot rock). The experi-
ments chiefly from Arthur
Boyd, Arthur Boyd and Arthur
Boyd—or, rather, Boyd and the
painters who are following him.
Boyd shows one of his wild,
ragged landscapes in shiny
paint, decorated with crows
(not a new work), and a more
recent nightpiece painted in
lozenges. There is not much
new to be said in lozenges,
but what can be said, in attrac-
tive blues and pinks, he says.
John Perceval’s forceful but
turgid “Disaster- Bay” has also
been seen in Sydney before,
and it is perhaps a tribute (or
something) to the New South
Wales landscape that two other
painters find their subject-
matter here: Kenneth Jack with
his stone buildings in a formal
blue storm at La Perouse and
Fred Williams with a flat, clean
watercolor of Mittagong in a
style distantly influenced by
aboriginal art.
George Colville with sheep-
yards on a hot day, Charles
Bush with “Evening in Canton”
and V. G. O’Connor with boats
and blue water after Cezanne
and looking rather like a tidier
John Passmore are other
painters represented. They are
at the Terry Clune Gallery.

An Apple Island trio are

training under Henry Moore in
London. He is interested in
shapes and contours, as a
sculptor should be, and only
gives perfunctory attention to
tone and color. Max Angus, on
the other hand, appears to be
divided —he provides a tenderly
impressionistic sky with a
fiercely drawn foreground, and

Films
li Around the World in 80
Days’*
Few books could offer a
film-producer # better oppor-
tunities for * color, spectacle
and action than this Jules
Verne story, and Mike Todd
certainly hasn’t let the chances
slip through his fingers.
A measure of the film’s
attraction is that its running-
time of three hours is scarcely
noticed. At no stage is there
any sense of dragging, and
even the bullring sequence in
Spain —the only one which
might have been shortened —
has expert clowning and crowd-
movement to sustain it. Most
important, however, Todd has
kept the many well-devised
and colorful spectacles always
incidental to his chief concern,
which is to tell a good story full
of subtle satire and Chaplin-
esque situations. ' .
And it is good, this tale of
wealthy London clubman
Phileas Fogg, who impulsively
accepts a wager to circum-
navigate the globe within the
prescribed time in such trans-
port as he had at his command
in 1872—by balloon, elephant,
ostrich, sail, train, sail-borne
rail-trolley, paddle-steamer —
and overcomes a host of diffi-
culties and frustrations,
generally by large tips and
modest bribery, to win with 15
seconds to spare.
One fascinating aspect of the
film is its challenge to the
audience to recognise the 50 or
so famous actors and actresses
who come and go through it in
bit-parts. In a San Francisco
dive George Raft hurls a knife
to discourage attentions to his
girl-friend Marlene Dietrich;
a pop-pianist swings round on
his stool in the same joint—
Frankie Sinatra; Sir Cedric
Hardwicke takes refuge behind
a handle-bar mo. as a pukka
English Army type in an
Indian jungle ; Jack Oakie and
Victor McLaglan are members
of the crew of the paddle-
steamer which is stripped to
the bones as its superstructure
and fittings are fed to the
stokehold to carry Fogg on
the last few miles of his
Atlantic crossing.
Fogg, coldly correct and
never at a loss, is in the sure
hands of David Niven ; Passe-
partout, the manservant of wit
resource who accompanies
him, is admirably clowned by
Mexican comedian Cantinflas ;
Robert Newton is the tenacious
bloodhound who follows the
wrong scent around the world,
his Cockney accent rather too
accented; and the Indian
princess who is saved by
Passepartout from the horrors
of suttee is rather colorlessly
played by Shirley McLaine.
A new kind of American
film. At Sydney Paris.
❖ ♦> ❖
Sydney Film Festival
Faced with a programme of
no fewer than 60-odd films
from 20 countries this com-
mentator spent, some time
choosing his field for the three-
and-a-half-day orgy at .Sydney
Uni.; and with five theatres
screening simultaneously, each
showing a different film or set
of films, compromise was
inevitable.
The French fantasy-film
“Entr’acte” recalled Dali and
Cocteau with its welter of
kaleidoscopic movement a
ballet - dancer seen from
beneath a glass floor, trick
shots of an upside-down Paris,
a funeral-procession shot in
fast-motion, stomach-twisting
rides on the Big Dipper, etc.
It was impressionistic, but not
disjointed ; the scenes were
linked compactly together by
their very incongruity.
“Un Jardin Public,” another
striking French opus, had
Marcel M.arceau miming eight
or 10 people in a park, his sole
aids a couple of hats and a
cloak. Last in this batch was
“The Magic Fiddle,” Norway’s
only contribution to the festi-
val : classical ballet, in color,
about a peasant-boy violinist.
One arrived at the Teachers’
College Hall after the Japanese
film “Twenty-four Eyes” had
started. The eyes belong to
a group of 12 Schoolchildren,
and their fortunes are traced
from around the ’twenties to
the end of the war. The
Japanese always seem to add
another dimension to their
characterisations, and if, in a
generally outstanding film,
with Hideko Takamine as the
school-ma'am, there was a
trifle too much sobstuff, at
least they were dinky-di tears.
France’s “Farrebique”—an
account of the season-by-
season routine of life on a
peasant farm —was treated
with careful observation and
naturalness ; the glimpse of a
rabbit scudding across a snow-
quilted field was delightful, as
were the harvesting scenes.
Then to the Wallace Theatre
for an Indian documentary,
“The Life of Buddha,” with
the camera flashing over scores
of bas-reliefs and statues to a
spoken commentary.
The Swedish film “Frenzy”
dealt with a schoolboy’s
deterioration under pressure
of his sadistic teacher ; it was


directed by Alf Sjoberg, with
Mai Zetterling convincing as
the slut who motivates the
Traill-like lad to action against
his Perrinic persecutor. Aus-
tralia got a look-in with “Late
Winter to Early Spring,” a
genuine if slender documentary
on Melbourne’s Fitz r o y
Gardens. Next, America’s
mercifully short “Jazz Dance,”
wherein a coven of hepcats
cut the rug to the jungle-
strains of a five-piece band.
Spain was strongly repre-
sented by “Marcelino,” the
story of-a boy who, when his
mother dies, is brought up in
a monastery and sees an effigy
of Christ come to life. Pablito
Calvo, the 11-year-old in the
title-role, is little short of
brilliant, and there are good
touches of the simple life of
the monks.
“Windfall in Athens,” the
only Greek offering, was
disappointing; for a comedy
it was far too long and diffuse.
Despite some breezy work by
Helle Lambetti, as the girl who
loses a prize-winning lottery-
ticket and finds a husband,
the acting was too often
amateurish.
Russia’s only film was “The
Grasshopper,” an adaptation
of a Chekhov story. The
melodramatic, culture - crazy
wife has an affair with a noted
artist; her meek, brilliant
doctor - husband (whose
function is to wander in and
say, “Supper, gentlemen,” and
who is described as having
“the face of a Bengal tiger
and an expression as mild as
a doe”) saves a youth from
diphtheria but contracts it
himself. It is then, while he’s
gasping out his life, that the
Chekhovian Madame Bovary
sees him, through the eyes of
his colleagues, as a person and
not as a mere inartistic figure-
head. “The Grasshopper” got
a Silver Lion award at the
1955 Venice Film Festival; in
many ways it is a triumph for
director Sergei Samsonov, who
catches Chekhov’s bitter-
sweetness perfectly.
Australia’s films, except for
the 1920-produced “On Our
Selection,” were all docu-
mentaries ; and one had the
feeling that, in a festival of
this type, films on aboriginal
art, coalmining and the like
must take a distant second-
place to inherently dramatic
European films.
But, paradoxically, a lush
Australian film plugging some-
one’s asparagus raised even
more laughs than the Yank
slapsticker “Safety Last.”

CHAIRMAN'S ADDRESS TO SHAREHOLDERS
SECOND ANNUAL MEETING
Ladies and Gentlemen,
The Statement of Accounts for the year
ended 30th June, 1957, together with the
report of the Directors, has already been cir-
culated to all shareholders, and before moving
for their adoption I would like to amplify the
report, and in due course answer any questions
covered by the accounts.
The satisfactory result of last year’s opera-
tions, as disclosed ih the accounts, constitutes a
record for the Company in output, gross earn-
ings, and net profit, and needs very little
explanation except to add that these results
were obtained since December last from con-
tracts entered into in 1955/56 for forward
delivery. These contracts are current for the
next two years and therefore substantially the
same as we are now fulfilling. (September
shipments 1247 tons.)
As a great deal of publicity has been given to
the fall this year in the price of rutile, some
apprehension will exist in the minds of share-
holders as to the future of the mineral which is
our main source of income, and it is our duty
to pass on to you whatever knowledge we have
on this subject, but it is difficult for anyone
to' accurately predict its future.
The substantial decline in price and demand
which has been evident to all during the past
nine months has resulted primarily from the
extraordinary interest and activity taken in
1955 by those attracted by the high prices
and subsequent endeavors and offers by
many producers and others to sell overseas, their
future estimated production running into astro-
nomical figures. Consequently, from what has
been published as an acute world shortage of
Australian rutile there suddenly arose the
immediate prospect of over-production as early
as 1957.
Naturally, buyers became cautious and almost
overnight from a strong rising market only a
nominal receding market remained, which has
operated ever since.
Synchronising with this local over-production
problem, the rutile market was shaken by three
factors: (a) the periodical decline in the
world’s metal market; (b) the decrease in
American Defence demands for Titanium
metal due to the change over from Jet planes
to Guided Missiles, and the hesitancy in accept-
ance of the new metal still in its testing stage;
(c) the increased use through improved tech-
niques of Ilmenite in most countries in com-
petition with rutile, and the development of
rich deposits of Ilmenite which were capable of
being produced at low cost.
In view of the above and in the absence of
any positive evidence of an early improvement
in the position, your Directors were reluctant to
enter into any heavy capital commitments to in-
crease production such as we contemplated last
year, and therefore we did not proceed any
further in this direction for the time being.
We felt, however, that until some stability
returned we should preserve our liquidity and
conserve our mineral resources by scaling our
production down to current demands, which
will ensure a satisfactory result, plus any
further material we can sell profitably during
the years 1957-58-59.
With this object in view we are embarking
on a vigorous sales programme with, a view to
exploring every avenue which will help to in-
crease our output to plant capacity, and we
have already achieved some success in this
direction.
Nevertheless,® we are optimistic about the
future of the industry ultimately. Our costs are
competitive in what now promises to be a com-
petitive industry. Our standing in the industry
is comparable with any other producer as
regards £ quality and dependability which has
been proved during the ten years we have
operated successfully.
Whilst boom prices may now be a thing of
the past, it must be remembered that any
success we have achieved was built over the
years on average rutile prices ruling at the time,
and the very small fraction of our output last
year sold at high prices had no material effect
on the general result.
Our rutile production last year was 4% less
than our estimate given at the last meeting,
but, as we had earmarked our Wollongong out-
put for the supply of the “spot” market which,
whilst it lasted, was very remunerative, we did
pot continue our increased production there
when we found this market had collapsed,
which accounts for the slight drop in pro-
duction above mentioned.
Zircon prices and demand have declined in
sympathy with rutile, but the other circum-
stances are not similar, and we have reason to
expect that we will be able to dispose of our
full production in future at satisfactory prices,
particularly as our close proximity to shipping
eliminates the main cost item common to our
competitors.
The export of monazite is now prohibited,
but arrangements have been made to sell our
normal production to the Australian Atomic
Energy Commission at a price to be mutually
arranged.
During the year we have consolidated and
proved several areas taken up by us previously
and also acquired others, which more than
replace the mineral reserves used during the
year.
In conclusion, I would like to express our
sincere thanks to all employees of the Company
who have worked so loyally and enthusiastically
for its success, and the Directors congratulate
all concerned on achieving record production
for the year just ended.
I now wish to formally move the adoption of
the Directors’ Report and Balance Sheet, and
call on a shareholder to second it.

Mercantile Mutual Insurance Co.
"EARNINGS of the 79-year-old Mercan-
tile Mutual continued to climb last
term, and since the accounts were ruled-
off the co. has handed-back the share-
premiums it collected in 1951, distributing
bonus-shares last month on a one-for-
four basis. The new shares will miss-out
on the next interim div., but, with the
growth of investment-income over the
past few years (it has doubled since
1953), there seems to be a good chance
that the current 123 p.c. div.-rate will be
maintained or, at least, that an early
restoration will follow any cut made in
the rate.
■Writing fire and accident business
throughout the Commonwealth and hand-
ling marine risks through a world-wide
chain of agents, the Mercantile Mutual
has made considerable progress over the
last decade, net premium income increas-
ing by almost 500 p.c. The co. has 40
branch offices (31 in the eastern States)
and additional branches are planned.
Paid capital was doubled by a one-for-
one issue at a 50 p.c. premium in 1951,
but the increase did not affect the well-
covered 123 p.c. div.-rate adopted in
1949, a 23 p.c. jubilee bonus added in 1953
bringing the average rate over the past
10 years to 12.7 p.c. Last month’s bonus-
issue lifted paid capital, all in f.-p. £1
ords., to £1,250,000. Deriving a high
earning-power from the co.’s sizeable
reserves, the scrip last sold at 575. 3d. to
return £4 7s. 4d. p.c. from a 123 pc. div.,
the bonus-scrip changing hands at 565.
Premium-income rose by approxi-
mately £300,000 during the year to June
30 last, reinsurances leaving net premiums

all departments, claims made-off with an
extra 245. p.c. of net premium income,

Expenses, including taxation, also in-'
creased at a faster rate than premium
income (adding 20s. p.c. to the expense-
rate), but with a smaller (down £50,000
at £100,000) transfer to the reserve for
unexpired risks the co. was able to show
an underwriting surplus of £145,855, or
£8937 better than the previous term’s
figure.
Net income from investments, which
for the past four years has exceeded
the amount paid in divs., rose by
£10,913 to £140,025 (or only £625 less
than the cost of«*a 123 pc. div. in the

advancing by £19,850 to £285,880:

Government securities remain the largest
single item on the asset-side of the
balance-sheet, but, in common with many
insurance-offices, the co. has considerably
increased its shareholdings in recent years
(with consequent benefit to investment
income), an additional £159,618 invested
in this fashion last term raising the pro-
portion of total assets represented by
shares, etc., from 19.9 p.c, to 21.3 p.c.
Provisions for claims and reinsurances
outstanding make up most of the amount
shown against sundry r creditors (up
£114,944), book-debts (up £146,213),
which grew a lot faster than income last
term, relating mainly to agents’ balances.
Including scrip issued in the current
term, net tangible cover for the co.’s £1
ords. is 58s. 4d., of which 18s. 7d. is
represented by the reserve for unexpired
risks.
H. C. Sleigh, Ltd.
/COMPETING successfully in markets
once regarded as the preserve of black
coal, petroleum products now provide
nearly 30 p.c. of Australia’s fuel require-
ments, as against 18.6 p.c. in 1947, sales
of motor-spirit alone doubling in the eight
years to 1956.
Making good use of the opportunities
offered by this rapid growth in demand,
H. C. Sleigh, Ltd., has lifted its turnover
more than fivefold in the 10 years since
the public obtained a share-interest in the
co., raising the ord. div.-rate over the
same period from 7 p.c. to 123 p.c. despite
a sevenfold increase in ord. capital.
Earnings have more than matched the
growth in turnover, and, following a
big jump in the preceding year, last term


saw a spectacular 76.9 p.c. leap in net
profit.
.Primarily an importer and distributor
of motor-spirit, kerosene, lubricating- and
fuel-oils, etc. (marketed under the Golden
Fleece brand), the co. also controls a
fleet of oil-tankers and coastal vessels,
conducts an extensive shipping-agency
business and, through a merchandising
division operating mainly in the export
field, handles a large range of primary
and manufactured products. In 1954
740,000 £1 ords. were exchanged for the
N.S.W. and Queensland interests of Purr-
Pull Oil Industries, Ltd.
Considerable expenditure on seaboard
terminals, storage-depots, tankers, etc.,
has been required to enable the co. to
keep pace with the expanding (but still
competitive) market, shareholders being
invited to put up fresh capital in four of
the past fiv? years.
The last three issues have been on a
one-for-five basis and have been made
at a premium of 25 p.c. When the 875,928
£1 ords. issued early in the current term
are fully paid (January, 1958), paid
capital will total £5,722,908, of which 5
p.c. prefs. (now carrying 6y p.c. when the
ord. div. exceeds 10 p.c.) account for
£600,000 and deferred ords. for £742,340.
Rights attaching to the deferred shares,
issued to the co.’s “principal petroleum-
supplier” in 1956, have not been dis-
closed, but are stated to be “most favor-
able to ord. shareholders.”
Supplying over 1700 retail selling-
points throughout the Commonwealth, of
which approximately 1100 are owned or
controlled by the co., H. C. Sleigh sold
an additional 15,935,000 gallons of various
petroleum products last term (to June 30),
the total gallonage reaching a record
109,283,000. Both the shipping- and
export-divisions also operated success-
fully, and, although tanker-freights rose
sharply following the blocking of the
Suez Canal, any effect on earnings (and
none is mentioned) was probably favor-
able, as the co. owns two tankers and has
others under charter.
Combined sales of the parent and its
subsidiaries climbed by £3,112,000 to
£19,251,000 over the year, but net profit
rose at an even faster rate, jumping from
£608,590 to £1,077,054, to represent 5.59
p.c. of sales as against 3.77 p.c. in the
1956 term:

Claimed after providing £805,186 (up
£379,522) for taxation and £510,595 (up
£99,532) for depreciation of fixed assets,
the profit covered the larger pref. div.
and 32.3 p.c. on average ord. capital
(26.2 p.c. on ord. and deferred capital
combined), compared with 23.1, 18.2,
23.5 and 21.6 p.c. in the four preceding
terms. When all issued scrip is fully-
paid a 121 p.c. div. would call for
£547,571, or £490,483 less than the profit
remaining last term after payment of the
pref. div.
Despite the substantial increases in
share-capital over the past few yeare and
the retention of a large slice of the earn-
ings, the rapid expansion of the co.
appears to have left it rather short of
working-capital. The position should
have eased somewhat in the current term
with the receipt of fresh capital, but at
June 30 last current liabilities exceeded
current assets by £1,137,866:

Eight new bulk-distribution or storage
depots and an undisclosed number of
service-stations were constructed over the
term, while a new office-building was
completed at Adelaide and a property
acquired adjacent to the existing Sydney
office, total capital expenditure exceeding
£2,000,000.
This outlay took care of the £959,300
of new capital and share-premiums as well
as a large part of the funds provided by
retained earnings and a £596,343 increase
in liabilities (mainly to trade. creditors’).
Depreciation left the net addition to fixed
assets (shown at valuation or cost, less
depreciation) at £1,570,490, an extra
£574,589 going into stocks and debtors.

G. & R. Wills (Holdings), Ltd",
'THE variety of its business interests
A has helped the G. and R. Wills
group to give a very good account of
itself since the public obtained a share-
interest in the undertaking 11 years ago,
latest accounts disclosing an increase of
11.7 p.c. in group-profit during the year
to July 19 last.
Developing from a business estab-
lished in 1849, the G. and R. Wills cos.
are now active as merchants, manu-
facturers and shipping-agents, and hold
numerous export and import agencies,
including the Australian agency for the
Bombay Dyeing and Manufacturing Co.,
one of the largest cotton-spinners and
-weavers in the world.
Headquarters are in Adelaide, with
branches of one of the two major
subsidiaries in all Australian States,
factories (turning out shirts, pyjamas,
underwear, etc.) being located in Adelaide
and Perth. Large shareholdings, including
scrip in Union Carbide (Australia), S.A.
Portland Cement, T.S.I. (Australia),
Goldsbrough, Mort and Co., Davies
Coop and Co. and Courtaulds (Aust.)
also provide a handy contribution to
earnings.
The present parent co., G. and R.
Wills (Holdings), Ltd., was formed in
1955, the transaction linking the group
more securely and involving, in effect,
a one-for-two bonus-issue. Gift-scrip
was previously handed-out in 1948 (one-
for-one), 1950 (one-for-two) and 1954
(one-for-six). A one-for-three par-issue,
soon after formation of the new parent,
increased paid capital to £1,150,000, of
which £150,000 carries a fixed 6 p.c.
The 13| p.c. div.-rate adopted in 1956
was maintained with ease last term, divs.
averaging 20.1 p.c. over the past 10
years, despite the frequent bonus-issues.
Although import-restrictions limited
activity in certain sections of the business
last term, both operating cos. (G. and R.
Wills and Co. and George Wills and
Co.) reported higher earnings, group-
turnover increasing by approximately £1
million to £l7 million. However, a
higher investment-income (up £24,420 to
£93,346) appears to be responsible for
most of the £25,189 increase in net profit
which, at £239,319, covered the pref. div.
and represented a return of 23 p.c. on
ord. capital, compared with 23.4 p.c.
and 20.5 p.c. in the two preceding terms:

Kia-ora Industries, Ltd.
HTRADING in an intensely
competitive market, Kia-
ora Industries, Ltd., reaped
some benefit last term from the
heavy capital-outlay of the two
preceding years, greater produc-
tion efficiency helping the co. to
show a small improvement in
net earnings, despite much
heavier provisions for both
taxation and depreciation.
Registered as 0.T., Ltd., in
1909, Kia-ora Industries took
its present name in 1951,
following-up the change with a
one-for-one bonus-issue in
which both pref. and ord. share-
holders participated. In the
same year divs. on the enlarged
pref. and ord. capitals were cut
from 8 p.c. to 5 p.c. and from
10 p.c. to p.c. respectively,
while a further £175,000 of
pref. capital was raised, taking
paid capital to £600,000 in
200,000 £1 prefs. and 1,600,000
f.-p. ss. ords.
A holding-co, Kia-ora has
four operating subsidiaries,
three of which are concerned
with the manufacture or distri-
bution of canned foods, sauces
and cordials, the fourth turn-
ing-out corrugated- and solid-
fibre containers, paper-cups,
etc. Following reorganisation
of production procedures in the

, tut, despite the fact that the
Bendigo cannery operated at
niaximum capacity throughout
the tomato season, the co. was
unable to supply several of its
best selling tomato-lines for
almost three months of the year.
As a result, total domestic sales
increased by only 3.8 p.c., as
against 15.3 p.c. and 18.2 p.c.
in the two preceding terms,
export sales being “maintained
at a satisfactory level.” There
was a further improvement in
the turnover of the container
division, and, with some
stabilisation of production-
costs in all sections, the con-
solidated net profit rose by
£5534 to £73,015:

build-up reserves of tomato-

MAORILAND FINANCE AND INDUSTRY
J>LANS for the formation of
a new Ministry of Trade
and Commerce, -to pursue a
policy of expansion of
industry within New Zealand
and vigorous trade-promotion
overseas, have been announced
by the Government.
The Ministry will consist of
three divisions: (1) A Division
of Overseas Trade which, in co-
operation with the primary-
producer organisation and
manufacturers, will give special
attention to developing over-
seas markets ; (2) a Division of
Industries, which will have the
specific duty of assisting in the
development and diversifica-
tion of industry in New Zea-
land ; (3) a Division of
Commerce, which will assist
commerce and also administer
the Government’s regulatory
functions in respect of
commerce for example,
import-licensing.
All three divisions will be
responsible to a Minister of
Trade who will be answerable
to the Government for the
smooth functioning of an over-
all trade and industrial drive.
The Minister will also be
responsible for the Board of
Trade, which the Government
will reorganise to bring it into
day-to-day. consideration of
the problems of industry. The
board will complete its present
comprehensive general review
of tariffs! and will then move
into the new field of advising
the Minister on tariffs and
import policy and hearing
appeals on those matters.
The Government has ex-
plained that multilateral trading
overseas is still its policy— to
sell exports in the best markets
and to buy goods in the .best,
not necessarily the cheapest,
markets.
,It supports the principles of
Empire preference set out in
the Ottawa Agreement, but
believes that revision of the
agreement is necessary because
of the great economic changes
which have taken place in the
25 years since it has been in
operation.
Wider Trading
In appropriate circumstances
the Government will negotiate
trade arrangements with
foreign Governments in order
to promote the sale of the
Dominion's products both
primary and secondary.
It has given an assurance that
N.Z.’s manufacturing industries
will be adequately protected
for the local market. In the
main protection will be by
means of tariffs, talTing fully
into account such factors as
differences in the cost of raw
materials, differences in wage-
and variations in
standards of living. But quanti-
tative restrictions will be used
where necessary for the protec-
tion of essential industries.
It is to be hoped, however,
that a realistically cautious
attitude will be adopted
toward appeals for protection.
One of the main reasons
advanced by businessmen in
favor of the formation of a
new Ministry of Trade was that
the Department of Industries
and Commerce, which for 20
years has had the job of
restricting overseas trade to
protect local industry, was not
the department to formulate
N.Z.’s trade policy for the
future.
This viewpoint was summed-
up by an Auckland business-
man.
Increasing Exports
“If our standard of living
is to be maintained for an
expanding population, then our
export income must be in-
creased,” he said. “The United
Kingdom is nearing saturation-
point at payable prices for
some of our principal exports,
and other markets are required.
“The securing and holding of
business in other markets is
going to be largely dependent

on our willingness—or other-
wise—to trade both ways with
such countries.
“A fundamental change in
outlook is needed on overseas
trade, and, for this reason, its
promotion and the control of
our overseas trade-representa-
tives. should be divorced from
a department whose tradition
lies in the protectionist rather
than the trading field.”
The Government has made it
plain that it recognises the
urgent need to seek and develop
new markets.
N.Z. —not a rich country in
raw materials —lives by trading.
Therefore the most important
and complex' of N.Z.’s
problems were in the field of
marketing, the new Prime
Minister, Mr. Holyoke, said
recently.
Britain’s Self-reliance
For 75 years New Zealand
had sold the overwhelming
proportion of its exports to
Britain. But Britain was rely-
ing more and more on her own
resources.
Between 1951 and 1956
British butter-production in-
creased more than four times,
her cheese-production more
than doubled, and her milk-
powder production increased
two-and-a-half times.
In those five years N.Z.’s
exports to the United Kingdom
of dairy nroduce decreased
from 291,800 tons to 288,900
tons.
In meat, too, the British
market in recent years had
been increasingly dependent on
domestic production, but a
marked increase in consump-
tion in Britain had caused New
Zealand meat exports to the
United Kingdom to show a
slight increase over this period.
Though emphasis at present
is on the development of new
markets, Britain will, of course,
remain N.Z.'s most important
customer.
The N.Z. and British Govern-
ments will hold joint dis-
cussions in London in
November on agricultural
production and marketing
policies. Agreement to hold
talks of this kind annually was
one of the achievements of the
New Zealand trade delegation
to Britain in April and May
of this year.
The N.Z. team going to
London in November will be
led by Mr. R. B. Tennent,
deputy Director-General of
Agriculture. It had been hoped
to send a Minister of the
Crown, but, with the elections
at hand, none could be spared.
A Pigiron Industry?
Within five or six years
N.Z. may have an industry
producing 250,000 tons of pig-
iron a year. That is the hope
of a group of business and
scientific men who have formed
a private company, New Zea-
land Development Corporation,
Ltd., to carry forward the work
of W. R. B. Martin, research-
fellow at Victoria University
College, who for the past eighr
years has been engaged in
investigations of N.Z. iron-
sands.
The company has a capital
of £5OOO, spread among 15
shareholders, but the chairman,
W. J. R. Scollay, has stated that
it will increase capital to as
much as £250,000 as circum-
stances may demand. At
present the accent is on investi-
gation and research.
A tentative plan envisages
using the Lake Taharoa iron-
sand deposits near Kawhia and
taking them to a manufactur-
ing-plant situated at Port
Chalmers.
It is expected that the plant
would, by smelting 500,000 tons
of iron ore, produce 250,000
tons of pigiron to be made
into steel worth about £l4
million annually.
There would also be by-
products of industrial gas,
titanium-dioxide and vanadium.
The by-products are estimated
to yield another £l2 million
annually. New Zealand, by
producing vanadium, would
become a significant world
supplier of this metal which is
essential in building atomic
reactors.
The ironsands to be smelted
are known as titanomagnetite.
They should yield approxi-
mately 60 p.c. iron, 5 p.c.
titanium and 0.3 p.c. vanadium,
apart from other ingredients.
A successful industry would
result in a big saving in over-
seas exchange. At present
New Zealand imports about
340,000 tons of steel in all
forms annually and 7500 tons
of pigiron.
Commenting on the forma-
tion of the company, Mr.
Scollay said it was becoming
apparent that the possibilities
for more development of
primary production, using
known techniques, were limited.
Nor was it certain that profit-
able markets would be avail-
able for any sharp increase in
N.Z. surpluses of primary pro-
duction. An iron-and-steel
industry, even on the small
scale proposed, could make a
valuable contribution.


The End of Olaf Ruhen
By GAVIN CASEY
IT was sad news for all
friends of Olaf Ruhen
when they learned that he
had gone to the United
States, because it will be the
end of him almost for sure.
Not that Olaf doesn’t like
Americans, or that Americans
don’t like him. They got along
very well together when he
invaded the U.S. occasionally
as an Empire Air Scheme
trainee in Canada during the
war, and they have done so in
other places since.
But Olaf is allergic to editors,
and there are too many of them
in America. They’ll outnumber
him hopelessly, and though
he’ll go down fighting like a
wildcat he has very little chance
of survival against such a
horde.
About 10,000 miles is the
proper gap between Olaf and
any editor who uses his
material, except, perhaps, the
editor of The Bulletin. To
reduce so drastically the
distance between himself and
the editors who now pay money
for most of his writings is an
act of frhe kind of reckless
heroism that wins posthumous
decorations.
Editors don’t make Olaf
sneeze, or turn his eyes watery,
like most people’s allergies do
to most people. They just make
him begin to smoulder with
indignation at the memories of
all the wrongs he has suffered
at the hands of their kind until
he joins battle with them. Then,
for single or small groups of
editors, it is time to be careful,
for over 6ft. of craggy Norse-
New Zealander with a seared
soul and a copious vocabulary
is a force to be reckoned with
in a newspaper-office.
In the years we spent work-
ing together I knew one editor
who almost used to hide under
his desk or in a filing-cabinet if
he heard Olaf’s . footsteps
coming along the passage.
Another —a more warlike man
—used to start stropping a
metaphorical razor and gritting
his teeth. But the only way
they could win over him was
to sack him, or irritate him so
much he’d finally tell them to
go to hell, and leave. The
latter method wasn’t at all
difficult, for editors.
I’m not much of an editor-
lover myself, but I have felt
sorry for one or two when
they were torn between respect
for Ruhen’s excellent work and
terror of his personality. In a
profession by no means short
of bush-lawyers, Olaf stands
out as a vivid and tireless
debater on the stupidity of the
assignments he gets, the idiocy
of the paper’s policy, and the
moronish incompetence of all
the sub-editors who murder his
copy.
Tp)E RSONALLY, I never
** agreed with him about any-
thing important except that we
both like beer and have,
I hope, a grudging but
genuine respect for each
other. We’ve shouted and
snorted at each other
happily for hours, but since
I’m not and never was an
editor, there was never any
real hate in anything Olaf
said. We had great times
—or I did, anyway—when-
ever we got together pnd
he gave voice to those
ufra-conservative views of
his that somehow often
turned out to be a darned
sight more radical than
my own Left-wing Labor
opinions.
Many's the time I have
bawled at Olaf that he is
so conservative that he
ought to be his own grand-
father ; but I was lying, of
course, and knew it. You
just can’t hang any such
labels on a bloke like
him, who is a passionate
individualist, but who looks
clear-eyed at the circumstances
of any case, influenced only by
what facts he can discover and
not by how they fit into any
dogma.
For instance., a few years
back this mighty believer in
individual freedom and effort
was, for a while, half-
condemned by the silliest of
the Sydneysiders who knew him
least well.
It came about because the
newspaper for which he then
worked had sent him to the
Northern Territory to investi-
gate and write about the case
of a native who had been
removed from his tribal terri-
tory by the authorities. The
Communists had, as they so
often do, enthusiastically taken
the “agin’ the Guv’mint” side,
and that had made almost
everybody else race to the
respectability of supporting
what had been done.
The native himself had
become the forgotten man in
the dispute until Olaf had a
close look at it, and made up
his honest mind that the
presence of the Communists
on the bandwagon didn’t alter
the fact that the native had had
a very rough deal. He said just
that, forcefully, and in a
twinkling the simpler souls
among the anti-Communists
had him “set.”
OLAF
This enraged Olaf just about
as much as editors, and nearly
got some citizens a handful of
New Zealand knuckles on the
nose. He survived it, of
course, just as he has survived,
during a rugged half-century of
life, everything from the
hazards of the depression, to the
ack-ack efforts of the Germans
to bring him down out of the
sky during the war,
‘\\X\/ITH the laws of libel the
v v way they are, and human
nature what it-is, it is rather
hard to write about even the
closest friend until he is safely
dead ; but, since the American
editors are practically certain
to claw old Ruhen to pieces,
perhaps I can take a risk or
two, and reveal his basic
secret.
This is that, like the Scots,
the Norsemen, the New Zea-
landers, and various other tribes
without the law, from which
he is descended, Olaf is just a
bit over-influenced by the hair
on his own chest. Real men are
tough, emotion is private,
editors are b—-—s, disappoint-
ments in larger fields are taken
with a smile, like defeat in a
game. These are not bad ideas,
either, but living up to them
imposes certain strains.
Olaf is tough enough, but his
emotions are powerful. When
things go wrong he grins con-
vincingly, as long as the
trouble is only his own. If the
trouble has hit somebody else,
it might be different. These
emotions surge up, his indigna-
tion reaches the point of no-
return, and he acts like an
enraged Irishman instead of
the dour super-Scandinavian
(with Southern Hemisphere
improvements) that he looks
like. Olaf’s good-humored face
can really get grim, and when
it does, beyond the set of
indignant expressions he wears
for editors, it means he has
found a nasty smell.
T7N plain fact, Olaf, as you
" may have guessed, is
thoroughly likeable and enter-
taining, in a difficult sort of
way, and just what American
editors will think of him is a
field for conjecture at least as
interesting as that of where
nuclear physics goes next.
Without having been there
when it happens, you could
write a Sherwood Anderson
sort of play on the meeting
between Olaf and Ben Hibbs,
editor of the “Saturday Evening
Post,” which now rewards him
magnificently for stories much
easier to write than those he
has been doing for The
Bulletin for years.
Mr. Hibbs is a character who
very much resembles Ruhen—
physically, at least. He is tali
and gaunt, good-natured and
patient, and, in the tradition of
the more literate eastern
Americans, most courteous in
an informal way. He talks with
a slow deliberation which, if
it didn’t originate in the South,
seems to have spread from
there.

••THE MASTERPIECE IN OILS”


A Bohemian Affair
By RAY MATHEW
THE trouble with girls like
Sally is that they have
no trouble. They look
well, they think well,
they have healthy minds in
active bodies. They know
what they want, and what they
are for. When they think at
all they think about that.
They play parts, of course ;
they take up painting or talk-
ing or motherhood, but they
are only parts and they tire of
them. Creative activity bores
them when its results are not
immediate and inside of them.
They are animal-women
without trouble of their own.
They cause nothing but trouble
to others.
They want to be.
The trouble about men like
Nicholas is that they have
nothing but trouble. It begins
when they are called Nicholas
and not Nick. They get ideas,
they become sensitive, , the
sound of the syllables fasci-*
nates them. They begin to
think they are like their names,
not simple and uncomplicated
like an animal tag, but melli-
fluous and full of meaning.
They become poets or poli-
ticians or lovers, though not
necessarily achieving any
poetry, politics or acts of love.
Creative activity thrills them ;
its results disgust or frighten
them. They admire straight-
forwardly animal men and
women, but have no approach
that can cope with them. They
are a trouble to themselves.
They cause nothing but trouble
to others.
They want to be something
Nicholas had known Sally
for a long time as a character,
a person to nod to, but it was
at a party that he first really-
saw her. It was the sort of
party that you might call a
bohemian affair: there were
painters and models, writers
and women, odd bodies with
highbrow interests; most of
them would-be’s except for a
lucky, unhappy few who were
might-be’s. They were all
employed at something or
other, every now and then, just
to make money, but they vtfere
all poor: they drank too much,
lived too much, the money
went. They thought outside
of nine-to-five society, and
were verbally contemptuous
of it. If it had not been
an old-fashioned word, they
would have called themselves
bohemians.
And their parties were sorts
of affairs. They were a re-
shuffle. Everyone knew who
went with whom and who paid ;
what man was steady with what
woman ; which painter had
slept in the Domain on Friday
night, and which girl was with
him holding the rum.
The parties confirmed or
denied these impressions. Their
nominal purpose was drink-
and-talk —always the possibility
of meeting the right person,
the intelligent one, the one who
understood you ; man or
woman, disciple or lover —but,
in real-life fact, the parties were
a reshuffle and the real purpose
was to see who left with whom,
and who didn’t leave at all.
The party was at Marion’s.
CHE had a party every Friday
and a new boy-friend too,
if she felt like it, but she denied
that her parties were regular
or her life promiscuous.
Her clockwork parties were,
she swore, the inspiration, of a
moment (“Let’s have a party!
It’s Friday, thank heaven!”)
and her men were, all of them,
new-loves, true - loves, the
passion-to-end-all-passions. She
was perfectly sincere, and her
parties were regarded with
approval.
Everyone lived in rooms, but
Marion had a place where
noise, late hours, screams in the
garden, guitar- and recorder-
music, never troubled the land-
lord. She had plenty of room,
too ; if you missed the last
train or your pockets were
empty or you happened to have-
struck the jackpot, you could
stay there all night. It was a
house in the suburbs, the bush
really ; because of the children.
Marion had children; an
illegitimate one that she had
had because she thought it was
the brave thing to do, two
others that were not brave but
careless, and a legitimate one
whose father she had mislaid.
At any rate, no one had ever
seen him, although pre-
sumably—he kept her. It was
rumored that he was “no good”
or “in clink” or even, by some
association of rhymes, in
Communist China working for
the Chinks.
It was possible to make
Marion cry about him, but then
Marion often cried at her
parties. It was a way of getting
attention, and it did relieve her
feelings. It depended, though,
on the amount she had drunk,
the state of her love-life, or at
what moment the children came
in to say goodnight.
They, of course, were adored
by everyone for five or ten
minutes and well on the way
to being thoroughly spoilt,
before Marion, misty-eyed but
brave, would shepherd them
off to bed. This performance
gave her parties an element of
wholesomeness that impressed
the more philosophically -
inclined guests most favorably.
They would sometimes make
speeches about it. “Here’s
Marion, a real woman, who’s
fulfilled her natural functions.
All you trim little bits sitting
in corners and yapping about
art, what have you done? What
are you? What are you for?”
The trim little bits felt it, too.
They hated Marion. They
fought to kiss the kids, tried to
bribe them to show 15 affection
with olives or a sip of vodka,
stole as much of .the scene as
they could or dared.
CALLY didn’t. She was
coming back from the
bathroom and was trapped
against the door by the sheer
weight of numbers as trim little
bits, bored children and
motherly Marion staged a
touching Isn’t-lifc-wonderful-
the-race-goes-on sort of scene.
The philosophers looked on
admiringly. Alfredo was
sketching the scene on a wail.
Peter the Painter, lying on a
broken-down bed that did for
a divan, rolled Black Sue to
whom he’d been practically
married for donkey’s years
away from Kim with his foot.
He didn't actually kick her, but
he made it look as though he
had. “You,” he said with
loathing. “You’re useless.”
Sue looked haggard and
hopeless no doubt she felt
useless; but her expression
won her considerable interest
and sympathy - of - a - sort
from the more think-
in - terms - of - seduction types
who littered the room. Marion
gave her a pitying look.
“I think,” said Sally, seeing
this, “that I am going to be
sick.”
She was. The incident
caused a sensation, the children
escaped, and Sally’s action
passed wittily into group folk-
lore as “Sally Criticising Life.”
It had quite a different effect
on Nicholas. Half-drunk on
vinegary claret, he was lying
on a mat being talked to by one
of the silly women with views
about big questions who were
always attaching themselves
to him. There was no doubt
they were his kind of woman ;
he could never escape them,
he encouraged them, he loved
them, they drove him mad. He
watched Sally. She was the
kind of a woman he wanted,
the kind he had been going to
Tahiti to find, the animal, un-
civilised, the honest; the real
woman.
“Yes,” the woman beside him
was saying, “but all great art
is basically simple after we
have been educated to it. Take
Matisse, for instance. Take
abstract-expressionism”
“You take Matisse,” said
Nicholas. It was the sort of
remark that had made him
famous as a wit, bitter and
devastating. “When she is


thirsty,” he quoted to the sur-
prised girl as he thought about
Sally, “she drinks. When she
is hungry, she eats. And when
she”
He got to his feet, swayed
over the glass in his hand, and
walked with determined steadi-
ness over to Sally. He had
known her and never known
her; talked to her, but not real
talk; admired her, but not
wanted. It was all changed.
He was, he supposed, in love.
Till then he had been careful
never to become emotionally
involved with anyone he
couldn’t get and get over
quickly, or if that weren’t
possible he managed to fall for
someone so far from him that
he had no need to worry about
it. He had developed an in-
spired habit of being hope-
lessly, madly, attractively, in
love with women who had just
left for Europe or Alice
Springs. His unhappiness and
despair made him interesting
to other women and kept him
safe from their worst excesses.
His poetry flowed from his
contact with them, but he
labelled it for those a long way
off. It was, he thought, a kind
of genius. It could not possibly
last.
He reached Sally, who was
leaning against the wall. She
was the type of girl to whom
he had nothing to say,
nothing that would interest
them. His scenes with natural
women had, he knew, bored
them to departure. But now
he had a theme.
“Come and I’ll wash you,” he
said.
“It’s that bitch, Marion,”
said S a 1 l,y. “She’s after
Alfredo.”
Sally was Alfredo’s woman.
She had been with him a long
time, longer than anyone had
expected. He never kept his
women long, but Sally had
stayed; no one knew why.
Everybody knew why the
others left: they tired of
Alfredo’s masterpieces that
kept them in excruciating poses
for hours ; they became bored
with his habit of finding them
casual jobs while he worked
for posterity ; they became fed-
up with a passionate Italian
who was a third-generation
Australian from Mosman and
as passionate, apparently, as a
Mosman millionaire.
His name was a mystery,
although one girl who spent
a week with him at Kiama
came back swearing that he
must have been named after
Tennyson. If so, he was
ashamed of it; he had been
Alfredo for as long as anyone
remembered. He was not liked,
and Sally was regarded as a
fool to put up with him.
She didn’t care. She didn’t
mind the casual jobs. For
some reason of her own, she
wanted him, and that was that.
She treated him with contempt,
of course ; she knew what he
wajs worth. But she put on a
tigerish display when rivals
appeared. She had torn at a
girl’s hair in a pub once. Like
an animal, everyone said.
Exactly! A healthy animal.
Nicholas was enchanted.
He dabbed at her dress with
a damp washer. “Do you love
him?” he said.
“What’s that got to do with
it?” said Sally. “He’s mine,
isn’t he? I’m not going to let
any fat little trollop like Marion
grab him just because she feels
like it. Am I? You saw her
act tonight. Am I?”
Confused, Nicholas began his
usual approach: talk of life,
love, death.
“I must get back to the fun,”
said Sally, while he was still
talking. “See you.” She went
back into the party and
watched Alfredo.
T)UT she did see Nicholas
again, often; he made a
point of it. He went to the
coffee-shop where Alfredo
liked to talk, to the. parties
where she might appear; he
questioned people about her,
he looked pale and stricken
when her name was mentioned.
And despite these antics it
was obvious he was sincere ;
it was the real thing. In the
circles in which he moved it
became a sensation, a scandal
in its seriousness, a matter
almost of envy. “Is she still
with Alfredo?” he’d ask. “Did
she mention me?” And then
the final degradation, “Will you
mention me to her next time?
Promise?”
Those he questioned left
him with the feeling that they
had never really lived, noth-
ing had ever brought them so
low.
When he met her he tried to
talk to her—in his old way,
but a little differently.
He tried to be down-
to-earth, honest, her
sort, healthy. It was
not an edifying spec-
tacle, but ' everyone
could see that it was
sincere. At last he got
to the point. “I want
you” he began.
“Do you?” she
said without much
interest.
“I mean —I mean I want you
to —come and have a drink
with me sometime, or some-
thing.”
“Or something,” she said.
“Well.” She laughed at him.
“Well, I’d have to ask Alfredo.”
Later he asked her again,
drunk on vile sweet sherry,
more directly and urgently. He
got his answer more shortly. It
was no.
He made friends with
Alfredo, actually sought him
out, actually listened to him ; it
was real passion. The small
circle interested noted it with
wonder: Nicholas gone. His
silly married women and his
first-year uni.-students tried not
to see it at all: their guide,
philosopher and more-than-
friend behaving like a character
in opera, serious about a
woman like that.
They disapproved of opera ;
it was not a real synthesis.
They said so.
Alfredo liked Nicholas. He
liked anyone who’d listen and
was devoted to anyone who’d
shout. Nicholas did both;
Alfredo regarded him as a

ALL MANKIND CAN CLAIM
EARTH’S FELLOW-TRAVELLER
TN one sense the Soviet earth-satellite
took the world by surprise ; outside
Russia it had been more-or-less taken for
granted that the American model would
be the first to take a moon’s-eye view of
the earth. But apart from the nationality
of the new moon the news that a man-
made globe no bigger than a large water-
melon had actually been fired-out 560
miles into space and then made to circle
the earth at 18,000 miles an hour, sending
out radio-signals the while, was accepted
by most people as quite normal and
proper.
Compared with earlier generations ours
has become rather blase about scientific
wonders. It doesn’t believe in miracles,
but it accepts as a matter of course things
its forefathers would have deemed
miracles. After all, to a public nurtured
for years on space-travel comics in which
quick flits to Venus and Jupiter are routine
stuff—one strip-story in the super-
circulation class currently has its heroine
winning a beauty-contest organised by the
emperor of a million planets—an earth-
satellite is in the hansom-cab class. When
the news of Sputnik broke, the scien-
tists of the Western world seemed more
surprised than the general public—which
suggests that in a world indoctrinated with
pseudo-science the scientists who were
once regarded as living in a kind of
dream-world are really the only people
with their feet on the ground.
“Gosh!”
The excitement of the scientists
expressed itself in different ways. The
most unconventional was the reaction of
Dr. Lovell, Professor of Radio-astronomy
at Manchester University, whose first
reported word was “Gosh!” An un-
named official of the U.S. earth-satellite
project commented, “Frankly, it’s enough
to scare the hell out of me. If they can
do that, they can drop 1.C.8.M.s [lnter-
continental Ballistic Missiles] on us.” A
similar thought seemed to be in Professor
Messel’s mind when he said (for the
benefit of a TV audience) that the news
“means life or death for us —freedom or
extinction of civilisation... .1 have a
horrible feeling that we are nearing the
end.”
Sir lan Clunies Ross, chairman of
C.5.1.R.0., remarked that it was not a
pleasant thought that countries under
Russian domination were becoming tech-
nically and scientifically ahead of us, and
other Australian scientists had the grim
satisfaction of saying that the launching
of the satellite bore out alHhat they had
been saying about the necessity for Aus-
tralia and the Western world' to train
scientists and technologists in far greater
numbers than were being produced at
present.
In America it was reported that
President Eisenhower, with a Francis
Drake touch, “stayed at his Gettysburg
farm and played golf.” His score was not
recorded, but his nonchalance was
matched in Moscow by that of Khrush-
chev, who told an interviewer that when
the chief official in charge of launching
operations had phoned him to announce
the success of the venture he “congratu-
lated him and then went to bed.”
The different reaction of the two
leaders is possibly explained by the fact
that Khrush. heard the news in the middle
,of the night and Ike in the middle of the
day.
Sour Grapes
The comment of Rear-Admiral Rawson
Bennett, U.S. Chief of Naval Operations,
that the satellite was “a hunk of iron
almost anyone could launch” smelt very
much like sour grapes. It could well
be that when the U.S. Vanguard swings
into its orbit next year it will prove to be
a more advanced type of moon than
Sputnik, but the point is that no one has
ever before succeeded in launching a
hunk k)f iron, a bunch of sour grapes or
anything else into space and making it
stay there. There will doubtless be plenty
more man-made satellites, but the
. Russians have won the race to put the
first in its orbit and there is no sense in
underrating the performance.
While on the subject of “firsts” it
seems likely that two Australians—W. W.
Watson, of the Overseas Telecommunica-
tions Commission in Hobart, and his
friend, D. H. Fisher, a radio amateur —
were the first people in the world to see
Sputnik (or its rocket-casing) streak across
the sky. That was on Sunday, October
6. Since then hundreds of thousands of
Australians have caught a glimpse of the
tiny impostor which for the moment out-
shines in importance all the normal in-
habitants of the heavens.
The Australian daily press, faced sud-
denly with the fact that the new moon
was a reality, gave the event excellent
coverage, roping-in scientists (qualified
or otherwise) to give authoritative, if
somewhat conflicting, versions of what the
satellite was composed, how it was
fired, what was keeping it up and when
it would come down. Most of them also
published maps showing the paper’s calcu-
lated orbit of the satellite.
Melbourne “Herald’s” chart showed a
course passing through Adelaide and
Cairns, but the astro-navigator of the
“Age” wasn’t prepared to bring .Sputnik
any closer to Australia than the Solomon
Islands. Brisbane “Courier-Mail” had the
satellite shooting across Indonesia and
New Guinea not far below the Equator
and also taking a Great Circle route from
Leningrad to Kalgoorlie, but safeguarded
itself by saying that these were “two of
the fourteen estimated paths.”
Adelaide “Advertiser” sent it across
Australia four times a day, twice from
NE to SW and twice from SE to NW.
This seemed the most unlikely of
the lot until one tested it by
revolving a suitably marked orange
inside a' schoolgirl daughter’s hoop.
As a matter of fact most of the
maps were probably more-or-less right
for one or more of Sputnik’s 15-a-day
journeys which enabled it to put a girdle
round the earth every 96 minutes.
But the course that was of most interest
to Eastern Australia was the one that
took the satellite across Sydney’s night-
sky at 7.39 p.m. For several days
last week it was a nightly ritual for
Sydney to turn out en masse and gaze
fixedly in the direction of the Southern
Cross. And, clear skies permitting, bang
on time the tiny star showed up, a little
further to the west each night, but with
a punctuality railway and tramway
authorities can only dream of.
There have been conflicting reports
about the military significance,of the satel-
lite. Professor Messel’s comment that it
is merely whistling in the dark to say the
thing has no military significance is quite
sound. It certainly isn’t going to drop
bombs on us, but a writer in the “Journal
of the Royal Artillery” pointed out some
months ago that the problems involved
in placing an earth-satellite in its orbit
are precisely those encountered in the
military use of guided-missiles.
Mass-research
There is no need to assume from the
success of Sputnik that Russian scientists
are supermen in their profession. The
Russian success is due to a variant of the
Nazi guns-before-butter policy. The
Soviet has thrown a large part of its
resources into scientific development and
the bulk of its scientific endeavor into
such things as nuclear-weapons, guided-
missiles and satellites. Massed-research
has paid-off with success —as well as with
an enormous dividend in propaganda
value. Even Khrushchev does not claim
that the lead is absolute or permanent,
and in two other fields —the atom-
powered submarine and the nuclear
power-station—America and Britain are
decidedly ahead of all competitors.
Although Russian brains and Russian
technicians were responsible for the suc-
cessful launching of the satellite the credit
is not theirs alone To the mass of pre-
liminary work and research that made it
possible scientists of all countries—and
not only of this generation—contributed.
The success of the venture is a triumph
for all mankind. Despite nuclear weapons
and stark prophecies of final disaster few
people really believe in their hearts that
it is Man’s destiny to destroy himself.
And of those who watched the satellite
last week they would be dull souls indeed
in whom the moving pinpoint of light
failed to kindle a tiny spark, of pride at
the thought that this new wayfarer among
the stars was made and put there not by
Russians, Americans or Hottentots alone,
but by Man.

YOUR SHOUT!
AND IT'S
RED MILL RUM.
First of the Cups
Given fine weather, there’s
certain to be a huge crowd at
Caulfield for the clash between
Tulloch and Syntax for the
£12,350 Caulfield Cup.
Selections are: Syntax, 1 ;
Tulloch, 2 ; Top Fred, 3.
On Saturday (first day of
the Cup meeting) Tulloch gave
further evidence that he has
developed into one of the
greatest colts seen in this
country. His effortless win in
the Caulfield Guineas lifted his
stake-earnings by £3500 to
£32,182, more money than any
other three-year-old has ever
won in Australia. Sailor’s
Guide’s £30,194 had been the
best.
Showers during the day had
taken the sting out of the
track, yet Tulloch coasted over
the mile journey in lmin.
37fsec., one second worse
than the race-record set when
Attley and Royal Gem dead-
heated in 1945. Consistent
Gay Saba ran a distant second
to the champion colt, with
Famed (who finished on) in.
third place.
Tulloch is in such superla-
tive form that few people
believe Syntax can give him
291 b. and a beating. Still,
Tulloch will have to set a
weight-carrying record to win
the Cup. Highest winning
weight ever carried in the race
by a three - year - old was
Poseidon’s 7.7 in 1907. In that
year Poseidon won both
Derbys and the Caulfield-
Melbourne Cups double.
Syntax has treated all opposi-
tion with disdain in his four
weight-for-age wins this season,
and if Tulloch can beat him
the colt will certainly rank
with the great.
• • • •
Syntax is due to have his
Caulfield Cup wind-up in the
Caulfield Stakes (today, Wed-
nesday). The only runner
likely to give him any opposi-
tion is Adelaide sprinter
Matrice. Some lesser Cup
lights will start in the £2OOO
mile-and-a-half Coongy Handi-
cap.
• • •] •
The enigma of this year’s
Caulfield Cup is Top Fred,
whose brief racing history.was
outlined here a week or so
back. Since then the five-
year-old gelding has won the
Ballarat Cup, in the same
effortless fashion that he has
won his last six races. He has
still to beat a field of real
class, but he could scarcely
“Which of you gentlemen is Mr. McHoop , the jockey?"
have won his races more easily,
and as a five-year-old with
only 7.6 he has a tremendous
weight advantage.
Add Sailor’s Guide (and one
or two others) to the field and
it can be seen that this year’s
Caulfield Cup should be worth
going a long way to see.
Five-year-olds have the best
record in the Caulfield Cup,
with 28 wins ; four-year-olds
have scored 20 times; six-
year-olds 14 times ; aged horses
and three-year-olds nine times
each. It’s reckoned to be the
hardest mile-and-a-half handi-
cap in Australia.
Perhaps no important race
in the calendar has proved so
kind to punters as the Caulfield
Cup. In the past 20 years no
fewer than 10 favorites have
been successful. Heavily
weighted horses, however, have
generally found it a hard race
to win: in the 80 Cups so
far run only nine winners have
carried over 9st., two of these
in the last two years. In 1955
Rising Fast set a short-lived
weight-carrying record when
he lumped 9.10 for his second
win in the race. Last year
Redcraze shattered that record
when he won with 9.13.
• • • •
“Scobie” Breasley, now top
rider in England, had a wonder-
ful record in the Caulfield Cup,
with five winners. Frank
Dempsey, now starter to the
V.R.C., won the race three
times.
Last year the Caulfield
Stakes had a striking bearing
on the Cups. Redcraze won the
Stakes from Rising Fast and
Evening Peal. Rising Fast
didn't start in the Caulfield
Cup, and Redcraze won it,
from Evening Peal and Prince
Delville. And then, in the
Melbourne Cup Evening Peal
beat Redcraze half neck.
The £3OOO Caulfield Stakes
(nine furlongs) highlights the
third day (today, Wednesday)
of the V.A.T.C. carnival.
• • • •
From 1930 until Redcraze’s
double last season, horses that
won both the Caulfield Stakes
and the Caulfield Cup were
Amounis (1930), Tranquil Star
(1942), Columnist (1947),
Peshawar (1952) and Rising
Fast (1954).
• • • •
With the Caulfield Cup in
mind, it’s perhaps worth noting
that Sweet Nell (1903) has been
the only winner of the Caulfield
Guineas-Caulfield Cup double.
Not many Guineas winners,
however, have had a shot at the
Cup/

On a day when visiting
horses took most of the honors,
Mac’s Amber, one of Victoria’s
best gallopers, pleased local
racegoers when he started

too much for him. Mac’s
Amber has a w.-f.-a. success
over Redcraze to his credit.

than the winner’s was that of

was at a disadvantage in start-
ing from No. 1 barrier, and,
after being one of the tail-
enders into the straight, flew
home to run second. He could
be a place chance in the Cup
with only 7.6.

at the New Zealand sales for
the Faux Tirage filly out of
Ada Fox, who races as Princess
Tirage. In the fillies division of
the Debutante Stakes she scored
her third win of the season. In
two starts in Adelaide she
proved too good for her own
sex, and at Caulfield she had
no trouble to defeat Posh, who
had won at Flemington the
previous Saturday. Princess
Tirage races in blinkers, the
first two-year-old in Australia
to win with that aid. Today
(Wednesday) she is due to meet
Gimcrack Stakes winner
Andabri in the Mona Nursery.
Adelaide trainer Colin Hayes,
who prepares Princess
Tirage, made it a double
when Pandie’s Sun scored a
convincing win in the mile-and-
a-half Herbert Power Handi-
cap. Last spring, the five-year-
old Valognes horse won the
Moonee Valley Cup and the
Olympic Year Cup, and was
one of the triple dead-heaters
in that famous Hotham. My
Hero and Rising Fast, in recent
years, were two Herbert Power
winners that went on to take
the Caulfield Cup. But it’s
a hot field this year.
Colts division of the
Debuta/it Stakes went to Mist-
ing, whose smart trial was
noted here a few weeks ago.
The colt is out of Play Maid
by Meadow Mist, and, like
most of his sire’s stock, is a
grey. He was bred by V.R.C.
chairman Sir Chester Manifold,
but when he was put up for
sale Lady Manifold and her
daughter Sally bought him
back for 650gns. Misting
showed amazing speed out of
the barrier, and was four
lengths in front before the field
had covered half a furlong.
From there on, he coasted to an
easy win. Garnet Bougoure
rode the winner, his first success
since his return from Singapore.
Speedy Sydney filly New
Light proved the good thing
betting indicated when she
scooted away with the Maroona
Handicap (5| jfurlongs) for
three-year-old fillies.
“Postilion”: Can champion
colt Tulloch match Poseidon’s
1906 record of taking the two
Derbys and the two Cups? If
he does his performance would
have to be rated better than
Poseidon's, because, with the.
penalty he would carry in the
Melbourne Cup, Tulloch would
be weighted well above
Poseidon’s 7.6. As a three-year-
old Poseidon had the remark-
able record of starting 14 times
for 11 wins and three seconds
—and was also responsible for
his owner changing his sur-
name! As a yearling he was
bought for 500gns. by Hugh
Dixson, a rising young tobacco
magnate. When his tally of
wins mounted, the resulting
publicity embarrassed and
infuriated his owner’s rich
uncle, who bore the same name
and had strong anti-racing
convictions. Poseidon con-
tinued to win, so Dixson took
the easy way out. He legally
changed his name to Hugh
Denison, under which he was
ultimately knighted and accu-
mulated a local press-empire.

—and Randwick
New Zealand-bred two-year-
old Gabonia (a 2000gns.
yearling), who won the First
Canonbury Stakes at Randwick
at his first race-outing, is a
smart-looking son of Gabador
(imp.) and Levonia, a Balloch
(imp.) mare from Princess
March by Vaals. Gabonia is
related to Limarch, winner of
the A.J.C. St. Leger and other
top races. Another relative,
Te Kara, was a crack New
Zealand stayer whose successes
included the Brisbane Cup and
the Auckland Cup (twice).
M. McCarten has got away
to a fine start with his two-
year-olds, Mighty Kingdom
having won the Breeders’ Plate
and Gabonia and Foison the
First Canonbury and the
Widden Stakes respectively.
Foison is by Damtar (Fr.)
from Deposit. Sellwood, who
rode Gabonia and Foison in
the opening events at Rand-
wick on Saturday, made it a
treble for the stable when Lord
Cortauld proved too solid at the
weights for Turkestan in the
Clibborn Handicap. Turkestan
was giving him over a stone,
and was only just pipped. On
the other hand, Lord Cortauld,
a plodding type, could improve.
Sir Sydney Snow and Allen
C. Lewis, for years successful
partners in horse-ownership,
added a further win when
Meerut proved too solid for
opponents in the Second
Canonbury Stakes. Meerut is
a half-brother to Peshawar,
who sported the same colors
and won, among other good
races, the 1952 Caulfield Cup.
The partners also raced Con-
naught, 1954 Epsom winner.
Meerut was having his second
start. The colt is by Jarnbo
(imp.) from Recaste by Revela-
tion (imp.) from Caste by
Posterity (imp.). Fred Allsop
trains the youngster, whose
family-lines include Veilmond
and The Monk. s
At time of writing, plans for
three-year-old Prince Darius,
easy winner of the A.J.C.
Craven Plate (his second
success at w.f.a., the other
being the Chelmsford Stakes,
in which, too, he defeated Red-
craze), include a run in the
Moonee Valley W. S. Cox
Plate, one of Australia’s richest
w.-f.-a. events (£5500), to be
run next Saturday week. After
that the Victoria Derby, and
the C. B. Fisher Plate are in his
list.
The Chester Handicap, main
sprint event on the final day of
the A.J.C.’s spring meeting,
proved an easy thing for the
brilliant Gay Port (brother to
Gay Vista, who’s now in
America). Gay Port, an easy,
free galloper, and a front-
runner, covered the six furlongs
in l.lOf, which was close to the
Randwick record. A week
earlier he had won at seven
furlongs in 1.22}, which went
close to Australia’s best.
Owned by Rosebery trainer
Leo O’Sullivan, the Port Vista
gelding could be a force in Jthe
next Oakleigh Plate and the
Newmarket.
Jack Thompson told an
unusual story to the stewards
when they questioned him
about Sea Hound’s erratic run-
ning over the final stages of the
First Canonbury Stakes.
Thompson said the gelding
“rocked and rolled” down the
straight. The strong wind got
under his mount towards the
finish, up to which stage Sea
Hound looked like being in the
stakemoney. The wind cer-
tainly was strong at Randwick.
Anyway, the explanation was
accepted by the stipes.
McGrowdie—he makes this
sort of thing a habit added
another A.J.C. Metropolitan to
his list of big-event wins when
he landed Straight Draw
(9 tp 1) a very narrow winner
over Gallant Lee (8 to 1), with
Book Link (7 to 1) a distant
third. Noel had already won
the Metrop. on Murray Stream
(1945) and Nightbeam (1944 L
He missed winning the recent
Epsom on Grenoble by a nose!

thought the siren must have
gone and blew his whistle to
signify the end of the match.
After five minutes’ pande-
monium, during which half the
players reached the dressing-
rooms, officials made it clear
to the umpire that the full time
had not elapsed. A handful of
harassed policemen finally
cleared the ground, the missing
players were recalled and the
umpire whistled play-on. But
there was no ball! More shout-
ing and arm-waving before the
ball was produced and the 45
seconds played-out. There was
no score in that period, how-
ever, and East Fremantle won
by four points after being eight
goals five behinds in arrears at
threequarter-time. How they
kicked 10 goals to one in that
final term made the game one
of the most thrilling tussles
seen in the West. The inci-
dent of the false siren - call
imbued the exhausted crowd
with enough vigor to stand and
scream anew.
“R.A.C.”: Steve Marsh
“the little man” East Fre-
mantle’s current playing-coach,
must rank as one of the all-
time greats of the Australian
Rules code. In his 11 years
with South Fremantle (1945 to
1956) he was a member of the
brilliant post-war teams that
beat all-comers (including Vic-
torian club-teams) and won six
pennants. He has won W.A.'s
top award the Sandover
Medal—and several newspaper
awards. He actually retired
from the game three years ago,
until South patrons urged him
to return. He has great pace
and courage; and a great
knowledge of tactics and
powers of leadership. Any
player not pulling his weight
will soon get one of his famous
“blasts.”

Sydney G.P.S. athletic meet-

events (open 100yds., 220yds.,
broad - jump and 120yds.
hurdles) and ran a flashing last-
leg of the 440yds. relay, to help
Joey’s win in record time. Me-
Cann, who set three records last
year, broke his own records in
the 100yds. (9.65ec.) and the
broad-jump (24ft. 4^in.).

McCann in the other two
sprints (in McCann’s 100yds.

specialises in foil-fencing, com-
peted in the championship, but
failed to reach the final. Graham

“Farinmail”: Though the
highly-industrialised north is
the traditional home of English
Rugby League football, “Old
Rep.” is wrong in saying that
the code is not played in
England outside that area
(B. 25/9/’57). In his History
of Football, published a year
or two ago, Morris Marples
remarked that there had been
a fair-scale development of
amateur Rugby League since
1945 in southern England and
that the code has also made
progress in the schools. In
neither case has its advance
been at the expense of Rugby
Union, but of Soccer. Its gains
in the schools have been in
primary, junior technical, and
similar schools, not at grammar-
school level. In Australia
Soccer is finding Rugby Union
a serious rival.

And Cricket
“Kejokada”: Footscray
cricket-coach George Murray,
who is also sportsmaster at
Melbourne’s University High
School, claims a record for the
school—five members of its
first XI played in district first
Xl’s in the first round: Foster
and Beissel (Essendon), Leigh
(Footscray), Leydin and Evans
(North Melb.). Another,
Shearn, was also originally
selected with Northcote but
did not play.
Three English Test-cricketers,
all on and around the 40-mark,
retired after the just-ended
English season. Most famous
of the trio is Denis Compton,
at his top one of the most dash-
ing of batsmen. With Sutcliffe
and Hammond, he is one of 4he
three Englishmen who have
made two centuries in the one
Test against Australia; he
made five Test-centuries against
Australia in all, and recalled
for the fifth 1956 Test against
Johnson’s team he hit a brilliant
94. Kent spin-bowler Douglas
Wright, of the long, hopping
run, holds the record (seven)
for number of hat-tricks in
first-class cricket; he was
not particularly successful in
Test-cricket, though Bradman
and other Test - batsmen
expressed great respect for his
bowling. Eric Hollies, of War-
wickshire, had a poor trip to
Australia in 1950-51, but in
county-cricket took wicket after
wicket. To Australians he is
best remembered for having
bowled Bradman for a duck,
with his second delivery to him,
in the Don’s last Test-innings
(at The Oval, Aug., 1948).
“Atala”: S.A. pace-bowler
John Drennan and fiancee
Eril Homberg are both over-
seas with Australian teams.
Drennan is in South Africa with
the cricket-team, while the girl-
friend is over in South America
with Australia’s women’s
basketball-team at the world
championships in Rio de
Janeiro.

List of opening-dates of some of
(1) the earliest, (2) the most
important, road and railway bridges
m Australia ?
(1) and (2) Available information
is sketchy and unreliable; conflicting
dates and facts can be cited. Some
bridges have been built and rebuilt.
Also, there is space here to mention
only one or two. The first viaduct
begun in Australia is given as that
over the Duck River, on the Sydney-
Parramatta road, begun in 1796.
Meehan’s plan of Sydney of 1807
shows two bridges across the Tank
Stream, one marked “stone bridge,
fell down, but now rebuilding.”
. (However, Lapstone bridge, on the
main Bathurst road, built by David
Lennox in 1832-33, is described as
the oldest stone bridge in Australia,
while being “the first stone bridge
in N.S.W.” is also awarded to the
Duck River bridge, opened by
Governor Bourke on Jan. 26, 1836.)
The Ross Bridge (Tas.) was com-
pleted in Feb., 1822. The Lansdowne
bridge, over Prospect Creek on the
main southern road (N.S.W.), was
opened by Governor Bourke on
Jan. 10, 1836. Here are some
others, mainly road-bridges, with
accepted dates of opening:
Prince’s Bridge, Melbourne
(opened Nov. 15, 1850); City
Bridge, Adelaide (1855); Albury
Bridge, over the Murray (Oct. 3,
1861); Angaston Bridge (S.A.),

(1) Who actually conceived the
idea of the International Geophysical
Year? (2) Is this the first-ever
1.G.Y.?
(1) According to the recently
published Once Round the Sun, by
Ronald Fraser, administrative
secretary of the International
Council of Scientific Unions (which
is sponsoring 1.G.Y.), it was the
brainwave of Lloyd Berkner, a
U.S. radio-scientist who in 1928-30
was radio-officer with Byrd in the
Antarctic. In 1950, “during an
evening of informal talk among
fellow-scientists in the Maryland
home of James van Allen,” Berkner
first suggested a co-ordinated effort
among the nations to study man’s
environment. “Among the com-
pany was Sydney Chapman, and
these two men sparked the begin-
nings of an undertaking that has
surprised them.” Chapman,
president of the organising com-
mittee for the 1.G.Y., has during his
career made important contributions
to such fields of study as the
behavior of gases, geo-magnetism
and the ionosphere. Berkner and
Chapman put the idea to the Inter-
national Council of Scientific
Unions (of which Berkner is also
president), and the I.C.S.U. in 1951
sanctioned the Year, and set the
project in motion. (2) Yes.

(1) Were Kingsford Smith and
Vim the first aviators to fly the
Tasman Sea ? (2) Were they the first
to try? (3) Did Jean Batten make
the first solo-flight across the
Tasman ?
(1) Yes. With H. A. Litchfield
(navigator) and T. H. McWilliam
(wireless-operator), they flew across
fiom Richmond (N.S.W.) to
Wigram, near Christchurch, on
Sept. 10-11, 1928. The flight, which
took in all 14 hours, was, of course,
made in Smithy's famous “old bus”
the Southern Cross, now nearing
Brisbane airport, where it is to be
housed in a memorial building.
1 he flight was postponed for several
days of bad weather; then a severe
electrical storm was encountered
on the way, and, said
McWilliam, only Smithy’s expert
handling got them through. (2)
No. The first attempt to fly the
Tasman was made by two New
Zealanders, Lieut. John Moncrietf
(pilot) and Capt. George Hood, in
a single-engined Ryan monoplane on
Jan. 10, 1928. In the flight, opposed
by both the N.Z. and Australian
Governments as being too hazard-
ous, both men lost their lives. The
last wireless-signal from the plane
was heard just over 12 hours after
take-off from Richmond, and no
trace of the plane or the flyers was
ever found. (3) No. The first solo-
flight was made by Guy Menzies
(1909-40) on Jan. 7, 1931, in the
Avro-Avian aircraft Southern Cross
Junior, in which Kingsford Smith
three months earlier had reduced
the England-Australia record to just
under 10 days. Jean Batten was the
first woman to fly over solo —on
Oct. 16, 1936, in a Percival Gull on
the last stage of a flight from
England. Her time (10| hours) was
the then absolute record for the
Tasman crossing. (Information
from Wings Across tjie Tasman, by
Leslie Jillett.)

FOLLOWED THROUGH
A Swagman tramped down a dusty road,
His condition was manifest.
A blue dog followed close at heel,
On that lonely track out West.
He knew where the friendly settler lived,
That handed them life’s chief need.
He also knew where the miser dwelt,
Who refused to give them a feed.
Year after year he had tramped those
roads,
And the dog was his closest chum.
He made his bed when the sun sank low,
At the foot of a spreading gum.
But death lurked near and with clutch-
ing hand,
It gathered him to it's fold.
The old dog woke at streak of dawn,
To find his master cold.
He licked the hands that had once
carressed,
But his sad heart know no peace.
He scared the caller who made report,
And he challenged the local Police.
He ignored their pleadings and scorned
their bounce,
And challenged their stern command.
With brissels raised and teeth ail bared,
He still had a job on hand.
But he forced a slug from the Oflicer’s
gun,
It ended a friendship true.
He sank in the sand close by his pal,
lie had followed his master through.
REICHHOLD CHEMICAL INDUSTRIES
(AUSTRALIA) LIMITED
CHAIRMAN'S ADDRESS ANNUAL MEETING. 1957.
In moving the adoption of the
Balance Sheet and Accounts
before you, with the Directors*
and Auditor’s Reports thereon,
it is pleasant to note that the
consolidated Net Profit for the
year, after providing for all
charges, including £72,700 De-
preciation and £132,763 Taxa-
tion, amounted to £245,349.
Total Dividends absorb
£130,670 which will leave
£114,679 as undivided profits
available to further expand the
Company’s operating capacity.
These figures are very grati-
fying in spite of the slight de-
crease in profit occasioned by
the recession in the industries
consuming the Company’s
profits.
After allowing for the cost of
the bonus issue of shares and
incorporating the re-valuation
of assets, the reserves and un-
divided profits of the Company
and its subsidiaries amount to
£458,137.
During the year, the Paid Up
Capital of the Company was
doubled by the issue of bonus
shares of £351,521 and a par
issue of a similar amount
making a total issued Capital
of £1,406,084.
Developments during the
year. Three major installa-
tions which have been under
construction during the past
year are now completed, but
obviously will not be fully
effective for the whole of the
current year.
1. The Phthalic Anhydride
installation at Botany has been
duplicated, and will become
fully productive at the end of
this month, as planned.
2. The New Zealand plant
was completed on 3rd July last,
and is described in detail on the
back page of the Annual
Report and Balance Sheet.
Already indications are that
additional equipment will be
necessary at an early date so
that production may keep pace
with demand.
3. At Springvale, Melbourne,
Victoria, a new Synthetic Resin
plant was completed last month,
and is now a going concern,
complete with spacious storage
buildings to carry stocks of raw
materials and finished goods for
the manufacturing and trading
requirements of the R.C.I.
group in .Victoria. A modern
office building has been com-
pleted and occupied on the site,
and adequate space for future
expansion is provided, both for
amenities and production.
The present Capital has been
adequate to finance these de-
velopments.
And now, Ladies and Gentle-
men, I want to say a few words
about the magnitude and im-
portance in this country of the
Surface Coating and Plastic
Industries, both of which are
closely integrated.
From a very modest begin-
ning, the growth in the last
decade has been phenomenal.
Plastic products are to be
found in many factories in the
form of pipe lines, roofing, pro-
tective clothing, electrical cables
and switch gear, containers for
corrosive liquids and drum
liners for an extensive range of
products. Our own manufac-
tures cover, in addition, paints,
varnish, lacquer, and printing
inks to mention only a few of
them. Some indication of the
potential is evident when it is
realised that the American con-
sumption of plastic raw mate-
rials is approximately 301bs.
per head of population. The
Australian figure is approxi-
mately one-third of the Ameri-
can on a population basis, and
it is increasing each year in line
with the general high growth
of the Plastics industry as a
whole.
Every new plastic material
opens up fresh avenues for
fabrication, and often leads to
the creation of new industries.
The Australian Plastics industry
is young and vigorous, geared
to an increasing number and
diversification of products, and
is certainly a challenge to
chemists seeking new and
widening horizons.
I am pleased to report that
business is continuing at an
increasing tempo since the close
of the year under review, and
that present trends indicate that
the Company should achieve
very satisfactory results during
the current year, particularly
in view of the greater produc-
tion we are now obtaining from
the new plants already de-
scribed.
It is with regret that I have
to report the death of one of
my esteemed colleagues Mr.
Cardiff Evan Lewis who was
one of the Company’s original
Directors. I would ask you to
stand with me for a few
moments in tribute to his
memory.
The Company has also lost
the valued services, through
ill health, of Mr. Charles
Frederick Broadhead, who was
also one of the original
Directors. Both vacancies have
been filled by the appointments
of Mr. John Adrian O’Neil-
Shaw and Mr. John William
Sadler, each of whom has
occupied a senior executive
position within the company for
some years.
Our Managing Director, Mr.
A. C. Hatrick, accompanied by
Mr. J, W. Sadler, Director, will
be leaving within a few days
for a business visit to U.S.A.,
Japan, China and the Philip-
pines, and it is confidently an-
ticipated that the knowledge
they will thus gain will prove
of great value to our Company.
As Chairman of the Board, I
take this opportunity of placing
on record appreciation of the
efforts and loyalty of the Man-
agement, Staff and Employees of
all the Companies within the
Group.
I have much pleasure in
moving the adoption of the
Balance -Sheet and Accounts
before you, and the Directors
and Auditor’s Reports thereon,
and call upon our Managing
Director—Mr. A. C. Hatrick—•
to second the motion.
E. S. WOLFENDEN.
Chairman of the Board.

/CUTTING through the con-
siderable and varied
comment on the increase
in the British bank-rate to
7 per cent., London “Econo-
mist” dismisses many of
Britain’s financial problems
as “consequential” to “one
recognisable and eradicable
root-cause —in the sense of an
internal disability which, if
removed, would bring the
solution of our other main
economic problems fairly easily
into reach”:
“That immediate cause —let
it be stated as a criticism of
nobody except the Government
—is wage-innation. If increases
in wages far in excess of
increases in productivity were
not annually secured by the
trade-unions, then the other
elements of cost-inflation could
be brought under control; and
if cost-inflation could be
brought under control, there
would be no flight from the
pound, and the problems of
the current and capital balance-
of-payments could be solved
by quite minor adjustment. If
income-inflation is not brought
under control, minor adjust-
ments —or for that matter
major ones —will be of no real
avail.”
It is now obvious, the
“Economist” adds, that
exhortation to the unions is
of no use, and that a solution
to the problem must be looked
for in making money more
scarce, “so that it becomes more
difficult for employers to grant
wage-increases,” and in making
unemployment less rare “so
that it becomes more difficult
for trade-unions to demand
them.”
This, though “they may not
admit it in their statements,” is
the aim of the „ disinflation
methods sponsored by both the
Labor and Conservative parties,
the main differences being in
their proposed way of bring-
ing it about.
Labor’s policy, summed up
by Mr. Bevan in “Decide the
sort of goods you want pro-
duced and stop other goods,”
is dismissed by the “Economist"
mainly on the grounds that
“even Mr. Bevan’s well-known
imagination ought to boggle at
the thought of any Parlia-
mentary assembly debating, let
alone deciding, what to do
about even a limited proportion
of the several hundred thousand
items that appear in any census
of industrial production.”
On the second suggestion—
“keeping down demand by
higher taxation and other non-
monetary means” , the
— N. Y. “Herald Tribune”
INFLATION—U.S. VIEW
“Economist” comments that it
has already been tried with
results which were “rather
disappointing, indeed mainly
deleterious”:
“There remains, then, resort
to a classical monetary policy.
One reason for hoping that
this may work better than the
other two policies is, no doubt,
merely the rather desperate
feeling that it can hardly
work any worse. But there is
also practical evidence to sup-
port the hope. Perhaps the best
course for those who have to
defend bank-rate as a method
of disinflation [is] to borrow
the favorite catchphrases out of
the mouths of their critics.
Stood on their feet instead of
their head, these criticisms are
often really the most effective
arguments for a classical
monetary policy:
“There is the argument that
the rise in bank-rate will ‘in-
crease the foreign interest-
burden on our balance-of-pay-
ments.’ What this means is
that it will make it more profit-
able for foreigners to hold
funds in London and thus sup-
port the pound. You cannot
reasonably say at one and the
same time that it is very
important for Britain to attract
foreign money, and then that
because Britain must have so
much foreign money it cannot
pay attractive interest-rates on
it. Foreign sterling-balances do
not grow on gooseberry-
bushes ; in a hard commercial
world they have to be enticed.
“There is the argument
that the high bank-rate could
‘lead to the break-up of the
sterling area if continued for
any length of time.’ What this
means is that it has now
become more expensive for
India and some other Com-
monwealth countries to borrow
here, in furtherance of their
over-hasty development plans.
Good ; this is the feature of the
sterling area that most needs to
be broken-up.
“There is the argument that
high interest-rates will cut
investment rather than con-
sumption. This is not quite as
self-evident a proposition as it
may seem. What a credit-
squeeze does is to cut expendi-
ture from before-tax funds
rather ‘ than from post-tax
incomes. Left-wing politicians,
who have always been most
critical of wasteful expenditure
on business expenses and from
untaxed capital gains, should
take note of this ; no capital-
gains tax they have ever pro-
posed could have such a
massive impact as the capital
losses imposed [by the
increased bank-rate] upon the
City [London’s financial
centre]. Undeniably, and un-
fortunately, capital-formation
is one element which is met out
of borrowing or before-tax
liquid funds ; but so are wage-
payments.
"There is the argument that
high interest-rates ‘will hit the
weaker industries and the
smaller firms hardest,’ presum-
ably driving the more marginal
of them into bankruptcy. It is
a fair point that the firms
which are most vulnerable to a
credit-squeeze are not
necessarily always those which
it is economically most desir-
able to cut off ; frost sometimes
nips first the growing plant.
But, to a considerable extent,
this weeding-out of the weakest
firms is again precisely what
the economy needs.
“These arguments must not
be pressed too far,” the
“Economist” concludes. “At
most, they imply that a 7 per
cent, bank-rate, by its more
direct effect in attracting
foreign money and in whittling
down the liquid funds from
which the wage-increases are
paid, is the best of the alter-
native restrictive policies for
defending the pound. But it is
still restrictive policy to be
resented, to be deplored, but
also not to be avoided. The
inescapable fact is that restric-
tion—of some sort, by some
method cannot be avoided
until the root-cause has been
tackled. How can the steady
increase in money-incomes—
not limited to wages, but with
wages unquestionably in the
lead be brought within
bounds? Anyone who refuses
to face that fact is simply
objecting to the thermometer
rising when the patient has a
fever.”
London “Time and Tide,”
which also prefers the increased
bank-rate to higher taxation —
“the planners of the Left seem
incapable of seeing any normal
difference between taking away
a man's own money and pre-
venting him from borrowing
somebody else’s money”—also

traces Britain’s financial
troubles back to industry and
unions:
“Britain’s lines-of-communi-
cation run through the City to
the international money-
market ; but the ultimate
battlefield is industrial. There
is no use blinking the fact that
there will be a battle. In a
genuinely free economy this
might not involve the Govern-
ment directly, but in an
economy which has been half-
socialised the Government
must take part both as the
country’s largest employer of
labor and as an influential
adviser to other employers. The
skirmishes which are now
taking place show that here,
too, profound moral issues are
involved.
“The dispute at Stephen’s
shipyard on the Clyde and the
dispute in the De Havilland
factories both feature one of
the problems which are bedevil-
ling British industry: the
inability of British firms, due
to the erratic behavior of the
unions, to quote the same kind
of firm delivery-dates which
their foreign competitors can.”
After quoting other industrial
conflicts and condemning the
unions’ “strange double
standard” which “insists on
the worker’s right to leave his
job but denies an employer the
right not to take him back, and
which regards a strike as a
legitimate vindication of the
rights of man but condemns a
lock-out as wickedly immoral,”
“Time and Tide” concludes that
“for several years now there
has been growing up in
Britain a disenfranchised class”:
“It consists of those people,
qnce thought the most useful
because the most industrious
and thrifty section of the
community, who feel that they
have been abandoned by the
Conservatives but have nothing
to hope for from the Labor
party. This is a dangerous situ-
ation as well as an unjust one. It
would be no mere act of class-
discrimination to pay rather
more attention to the interests
of these people; it would
simply be a belated recognition
of those values and habits of
life without which our economy
has little chance of reviving.
“Anyone who travels in
America or Canada immedi-
ately notices a wholly different
attitude. Hard work, success,
the accumulation and inheri-
tance of money are there con-
sidered creditable rather than
shameful activities; they are
rewarded rather than penalised.
These are the very activities
which both political parties and
that new estate of the realm, the
trade-unions, still seem to dis-
courage in Britain. Unless this
attitude changes really
changes, not as a mere matter
of lip-service—-no mere fiscal
device can save us in the long
run, however useful in itself.”
" Antimissile Missiles"
Since the Russian announce-
ment of successful development
in the field of intercontinental
ballistic missiles the search for
defence against such weapons
has taken on fresh urgency.
Earlier in the piece, U.S.
authorities considered them
unstoppable ; later .thinking is
more optimistic, as indicated,by
the following interview with a
“highly qualified authority,”
reprinted from the “U.S. News
and World Report,” an inde-
pendent weekly news-magazine
published at Washington
(Copyright 1957 United States
Publishing Corporation). The
interview was, of course,
published before Russia's
successful launching of its
satellite and subsequent
announcements of revision in
U.S. defence-programmes.
Is there a defence against
the intercontinental ballistic
missile?
Yes. All studies show it to
be technically feasible and
within the foreseeable state of
the art to provide a defence
against the 1.C.8.M. Russia’s
missile can be stopped.
Is the defence available
today?
No.
How many years away is it ?
The exact availability is, of
course, classified. However, the
date of initiation of develop-
ment and the normal course
of surface -to - air missile
developments indicate that an
effective defence can be
deployed and available in the
mid-1960’5, if adequate support
is given the programme. The
Army is assigning high priority
to this project to assure the
earliest practicable date.
What is the so-called anti-
missile missile ?
It is the Army’s Nike-Zeus, a
high-performance surface-to-air
missile that can defend cities,
vital installations and specified
areas from ballistic-missile
attack. The system will destroy
enemy missiles, including the
1.C.8.M., before they reach an
altitude dangerous to our pro-
tected ground installations. It
will destroy 1.C.8.M.s and
their lethal load regardless of
where or when they are
launched. That includes any

missile that Russia may
develop.
The Army feels that a point-
defence missile-system will be
required for an effective defence
against the 1.C.8.M., indicating
that the anti-1.C.8.M. weapon-
system will be within the
Army’s responsibilities.
When was the defence con-
cept developed ?
The Army has been studying
defence against ballistic
missiles since 1946. When the
U.S. ballistic-missile effort was
accelerated those studies were
likewise accelerated. In fiscal
year 1957 basic studies were
completed and the Army started
work on an anti-1.C.8.M.
system. Hardware results to
date have confirmed the Army
studies.
Has the cutback programme
affected the development of an
antimissile in any way ?
To date it has not. The Army
still intends to fund anti-
1.C.8.M. programmes in fiscal
year 1958 [started July 1, 1957]
at the rate planned prior to
recent Budget cuts. This, how-
ever, is for fiscal year 1958
only. If funds for future years
are not available in the amounts
required, the operational-
availability date will be delayed
by a span of time proportional
to the cuts.
What other phases of the
missile-programme have been
affected by economy cutbacks ?
All phases of the Army’s
air-defence programme are
affected. The Army’s troop-
programme for units of the
Army Air Defence Command
is geared to the budget for
Nike-Hercules equipment. The
cutback will mean that the
Army cannot modernise our
air defence as rapidly as it
considered necessary—that is,
replace Nike-Ajax [present air-
defence missile] with Nike-
Hercules and Hawk [more
advanced missiles] at the rate
permitted by technology and
the Army training programme.
The cutback in research and
development funds will mean
that future modernisation will
likewise be delayed.
But contracts for developing
the defence-system against the
1.C.8.M. have not been cut ?
No.
And U.S. industry already is
at work on the problem of
designing and building the anti-
1.C.8.M. missile ?
Yes. Bell Telephone Labora-
tories and the Douglas Aircraft
Company and Sylvania Electric
Products, Inc., are three com-
panies working on this project.
Are military leaders confi-
dent that the antimissile missile
M’ill be a success ?
This is what Lieutenant
General James M. Gavin, Chief
of Army Research and
—London “Time and Tide”
“ONE MORE WORD OUT OF YOU AND I’LL
SEVER OUR CONNECTIONS”
(Fred Shilling, freelancing in London, was formerly on Melbourne “Argus”
and South Africa's “Cape Times.”)
Development, recently told
Congress:
“One of the most significant
things... .is that the defence
against a surface-to-surface
missile, including the 1.C.8.M ,
is entirely feasible. One reads
all the time about this weapon
being an absolute weapon. We
know it is not at all. There is
a defence against it. We must
get on with getting such a
defence for our country.”
General Gavin added: "I
was very disturbed that
one of our most distinguished
military analysts.... wrote an
article on that subject and he
stated there was no defence
against it.... This is techni-
cally absolutely wrong. People
should not believe these things.
It is very damaging.”
Later, an official statement
from General Gavin was
released by the House Appro-
priations Committee, stating:
“The Army is responsible for
developing, procuring and
operating surface-to-air missiles
to be employed against enemy
piloted aircraft and missiles of
all types... .This responsibility
includes the acquisition of
tracking radars and other
equipment required.... Pro-
gress to date in the fulfilment
of this mission has been excel-
lent and we know now that
the job can be accomplished.”
Disarmament
The six “general objectives”
of the West’s disarmament
proposals, as put to the
United Nations Disarmament
Commission by U.S. repre-
sentative Henry Cabot Lodge:
“The first general objective
is the early cessation of pro-
duction of fissionable materials
for weapons purposes, under
effective international control,
and the complete devotion of
future production of fission-
able materials to peaceful
purposes. We propose that this
cessation of production take
place as soon as an inspection-
system capable of verifying it
has been agreed and put into
effect. Acceptance of this pro-
posal would mean an immedi-
ate end to the build-up of
nuclear-arms stockpiles. It is
a progressive proposal, entirely
feasible and in line with the
resolutions adopted by the
[U.N.] Assembly.
“Second, the cessation of
testing of nuclear weapons,
under effective international
control. We propose that, at
the outset of a first-stage dis-
armament agreement, nuclear-
weapons tests be suspended for
a period of 24 months while
arrangements are being worked
out to ensure the cut-off of
fissionable production for
weapons purposes. The second
12 months of this suspension
depends only upon making
progress in this direction and
on the installation of an inspec-
tion-system to police the test
suspension. Nations would be
free to resume testing if, after
two years, a fissionable produc-
tion cut-off had not been put
into effect.
“Third, we seek reciprocal
reduction of armed forces and
armaments. We have proposed
a practical start in this direc-
tion. Our approach to the
problem of reducing conven-
tional armaments avoids many
of the difficulties which we
would otherwise face. We
propose that specified and
agreed modern armaments of
land, air and sea be deposited
in storage depots under inter-
national supervision. We are
prepared to begin negotiations
at any time on the specific arms
for deposit. At the same time
we have expressed a willing-
ness to accept for ourselves a
first-step ceiling of 2.5 million
armed forces. We have agreed
to specify second- and third-
stage ceilings of 2.1 and 1.7
million. We hope and believe
that a first-stage agreement will
result in progress toward the
settlement of a number of the
outstanding problems which
create international friction,
and make feasible the attain-
ment of lower force-levels.
“A fourth objective is the
progressive establishment of

systems of open inspection
with ground and aerial com-
ponents. We have proposed
that a beginning be made in
areas in which protection
against surprise attack is of
greatest importance.
“The fifth principle foresees
the beginning of the elimipa-
tion of nuclear weapons by
transferring an equitable and
agreed basis stocks of fission-
able materials from previous
weapons-production to inter-
nationally-supervised peaceful
uses. This proposal is in
accordance with the ' objective
set by the United Nations. It is
a logical and feasible step
toward meeting that objective.
“Finally, we seek agreement
on measures to control the
newest threat to peace: the
outerspace missile. This weapon
is too new for us to be able to
present precise and detailed
proposals to deal with it. But
it Is potentially so dangerous
that it cannot be ignored. We
propose as our next objective
that means be designed to
assure that the sending of
objects through outer space will
be for exclusively scientific and
peaceful purposes.”
Russia, Israel and the
West
The “ancient _ and bad
tradition” of anti - Semitism
which, fortified to some extent
by Lenin’s dictum that
Zionism and Communism were
incompatible, has waxed and
waned in Russia according to
circumstances and leaders—it
reached terrorist proportions in
Stalin’s last years—has been
given a new political purpose
with the Soviet’s venture into
the Middle East.
“Since. Khrushchev took
over,” comments London “New
Statesman,” “there is every
reason to believe that the
element of terror has gone.
“But the anti-Semitism
which has bedevilled politics in
the Slav countries since long
before 1917 continues, and is
exemplified in many of Khru-
shchev’s personal attitudes.
Moreover, anti-Zionism' which
ought to have become a dead
letter in Soviet politics, has
been actually increased by the
Soviet conviction that Israel is
an island of Western im-
perialism in the anti-colonial
sea of the Middle East.
Thus the obvious solution,
that those Soviet Jews who
have not been successfully
assimilated —and who thus feel
a tug of loyalty to another
State —should be encouraged
to emigrate to Israel, is politi-
cally objectionable, and the
distribution of harmless Israeli
propaganda is regarded as an
anti-Soviet act.”
“Manchester Guardian” also
notes that “Communists have
special reasons, beyond the age-
old ones, for encouraging anti-
Semitism” :
“Judaism is’ based on
religious faith, and all religion
is a rival ideology [to Com-
munism]. It favors an -inter-
national outlook, and ‘cosmo-
politanism’ became a sin when
Stalin harnessed the force of
Russian nationalism to that of
Soviet Communism. And with
the establishment of a Jewish
national home in Palestine it
provided a rival focus for
loyalties which Jews could be
accused of harboring no matter
how patriotically Russian, or
indeed fanatically Communist,
they might be. *
“Today anti-Semitism, with
so many domestic advantages
old and new, turns out to be
an invaluable instrument also
of foreign policy. For the
Soviet Union has gained access
to the politics of the Middle
East by claiming to be the
champion of Arab nationalism
in its struggle against the
Western ‘colonialists’ and their
tool the State of Israel.
“The more vituperative the
Russians are about the
Israelis the more popular they
become with the Arabs. It is
most doubtful whether they
want to see Israel invaded, with
the risk of a world war ; they
can make trouble more effec-
tively more cheaply. The
Russians know that in this
game they have the field to
themselves ; the Western Powers
cannot compete. The Western
Powers should not even try.
Sooner or later they will have
to come to terms with Arab
nationalism ; there is no future
for them in the Middle East
Unless they do. But they must
not do it at the expense of
Israel.”
Writing in London “Sunday
Times,” Aidan Crawley also
comments that “in the last
analysis Britain and America
must either shoulder the burden
of their Zionist experiment or
lose the Middle East.”
Crawley, supporting the
“Eisenhower Doctrine” for the
Middle East, notes that,
while - there may be “some-
thing ludicrous about a great
[U.S.] armada steaming up and
down [the Mediterranean],
offering help to Arab rulers who
are too afraid to accept it,
there is really no logical
alternative.”
First he dismisses three
popular suggestions:
“One, which is canvassed
privately by many civil servants
and politicians, is that we
should deliberately have no
policy at all. When in doubt
leave the initiative to others
and hope for the best. It was
this policy which led to both
the world wars.
“A second, which has been
openly supported by the Left-
wing of the Labor party, is of
a condominium with Russia
throughout the Middle East. In
a sentence, this means that we
should ask the Russians to
help in the development of
Middle Eastern countries and
trust them not to introduce
Communism.
“A third solution, for which
theoretically there is much
more to be said, is to persuade
the Arab States to share
between them the income from
oil which at the moment is
enjoyed only by those on whose
property oil is found. But since
no existing Arab Government
which possesses oil is ready to
agree to such a scheme, it
can be brought about only by
fomenting revolution in Irak,
Kuwait, Bahrein, and Saudi
Arabia.
“The truth which President
Eisenhower has at last recog-
nised,” Crawley concludes, “is
that, having destroyed British
power In the Middle East, he
can hope for no solution of the
problems in this part of the
world which does not involve
the risk of a clash between the
United States and the Soviet
Union. Instead of throwing up
our hands in horror that the
President is prepared to run
such a risk, we [Britain] should
be glad.”
Britain’s contribution,
Crawley continues, must recog-
nise that “the crux of the whole
problem is Israel. So long as
the Arabs retain any hope that
they one day will be able to
destroy Israel there will be no
stability in the Middle East.
And that hope will live until
Israel’s frontiers are decided
and guaranteed. This 'is the
one problem on the solution of
which all else hangs. To con-
tinue to sell arms to Jordan,
Israel, Syria and Egypt while
Israel’s frontiers are undecided
is simply to ensure that the
next Arab-Israel war will be so
big that it will be more than
ever difficult to localise.
“And since agreement over
Israel’s frontiers, either between
the Arabs and Jews or between
the United States .and Russia,
is impossible, the only policy
is for the United States, Great
Britain and France to decide
exactly what frontiers they will
guarantee.
“They must then make it
plain to the Arabs that if
Israel infringes them sanctions
upon Israel will immediately be
imposed, and that if the Arabs
infringe them Israel will imme-
diately be supported. If the
other Nato PcAveps could be
induced to support this policy
it would be so much the
stronger. Nothing less than
this will convince the Arab
world that the State of Israel
is there to stay ; nothing less
will check the spread of Russian
influence.”

THE OTHER FELLOW'S MIND
Local Government
One night last week I did
what a good many other com-
plaining ratepayers might do
with advantage—attended one
of the monthly meetings of the
local borough council.
Criticism of such bodies is
almost a national characteristic,
but much of it springs from
ignorance of what is involved
iu local-government and a clear
idea of what councils are per-
mitted to do within the powers
of the Local Government Act.
In our local council the
mayor is a progressive chemist
conducting two shops ; he came
up the hard way through the
depression and has some
respect foi the value of money
and its prudent spending.
Round the council table were
a successful contractor who has
established a solid local
industry from scratch ; a civil
servant who takes a keen
interest is all manner of local
activities ; a plumber with long
years of service to the council
and an intimate knowledge of
local problems; an officer of
the State Electricity Commis-
sion, with 13 years’ council ser-
vice and keen on all move-
ments for the town’s progress ;
a guest-house proprietor, a
shrewd Scotsman who would
not see the ratepayers’ money
wasted if he could help it; a
butcher, latest recruit to the
council table and carefully feel-
ing his way; a doctor of
dentistry with a good grip on
things other than teeth ; and a
hotelkeeper with other
important interests and progres-
sive ideas.
They were as representative a
lot as you could want. In
attendance was the town clerk,
ready and able to answer any
question shot at him by the
councillors of course
“through the Mayor.” I was
reminded of the teacher in “The
Deserted Village” whose one
small head could carry all he
knew. Also presefit, in case he
was needed in any of the
“Going far ?"
discussions, was the borough
engineer. '
Subjects on the agenda paper
included: installation of town
sewerage ; ferry terminal for
Bass Strait service ; the usual
finance headache; camping-
and caravan-services; provi-
sion of new council chambers,
footpaths, roads and drainage ;
and building-permits. There
were many other matters aris-
ing from correspondence and
odds and ends of business. It
was noticeable that, although
councillors held very divergent
views on some subjects, a fair
compromise was reached after
sensible discussion.
The meeting began at 7 p.m.,
and it was well after midnight
when some business had to be
postponed to a later meeting.
I could not help comparing
those public-minded men and
their voluntary unpaid service
with the professional type of
politicians. The time they
devote to borough affairs, nof
only in council but on various
committees, would represent a
large amount of money, even
at basic-wage rates. Ceg

Standard Gauge
It is good‘news that standard-
gauge is at last being brought
to the Albury-Melbourne line,
but most people will want to
know why the standardisation
of that vital link, the Broken
Hill-Port Pirie railway, has not
been undertaken at the same
time.
First brought to the notice
of the Commonwealth Govern-
ment on September 20, 1940,
the project has been nearly
started, ouiy to be put aside, on
at least three occasions. On
March 10, 1944, the link was
given first priority for strate-
gical reasons by the Defence
Department. On September
14, 1950, the Minister for
I ranspo. t announced another
postponement, saying that
housing and coal-production
were more important than rail-
way-gauge standardisation.'
At Marree (S.A.), on July
27 this year, Acting Prime
Minister Sir Arthur Fadden
opened the new 216-mile
standard-gauge railway from
Sterling North to Marree. At
the accompanying dinner, P. J.
Hannaberry, Commonwealth.
Commissioner for Railways,
said that, considering standard-
isation from a national view
point and as a long-term
project, it was obvious that the
Broken Hill-Port Pirie-Adelaide
project should come first, the
Kalgoorlie-Fremantle section
second, and the Melbourne-
Albury section third. He added
that if the Commonwealth
allotted £5 million a year for
standardisation it would only
amount to 2s. 6d. in £lOO on
the national income for 1954-
55.
No further time should be
lost in making a start on the
Broken Hill-Port Pirie link.—

Parliamentary Time-saver
When, a couple of months
ago, Westralia’s Labor Premier
suggested that a member of
his Cabinet would introduce a
certain measure a member of
his party assured him that the
proposed bill was certain to
be defeated. The Premier
asked for more definite proof
and the member prepared a
statement which he invite 1
members to sign, irrespective
of party. Three-fifths of the
members of the Lower House,
including the entire Country
party, signed, and the state-
ment was given to the Premier.
The bill was introduced and
debated heatedly for five
weeks, while more newspaper-
space was devoted to the
subject than to any other since
the secession issue. Finally,-the
bill was thrown out by 29" votes
to 14.
That result was obvious from
the start, and any experienced
reporter who was present when
the bill was introduced could
have said so. But for some
obscure reason that bill, which
was unimportant to 90 per
cent, of the population, had to
occupy a great deal of time

matters.
Why couldn’t that statement,
signed by 30 members of a
House of 50, have scotched the
bill right from the start? If
it comes to that, why couldn’t
the practice be extended to
other non-party matters? If a

is certain to be rejected, that
should be accepted as sufficient
reason for dropping it. —

Hoarded Relics
Something surely could be
done about the amount of
material uselessly lying in the
Army base ordnance depots
of the States. A great per-
centage of this material is
obsolete and can never be used.
At Moorebank (N.S.W.)
there are roughly 20 acres of
huge storehouses stacked to
bursting with outdated equip-
ment in which there is little or
no movement. All this has to
be watched by flocks of store-
men and guards, checked by
gaggles of stocktakers, and re-
checked by prides of auditors
With defence becoming a
matter of pushbutton wallahs,
stocks for potential armies are
redundant and should be
disposed of, particularly when
new designs are coming all the
time and outmoding the out-
moded.
The same applies to the anti-
quated tanks and other heavy
equipment lying about. No
doubt they have been canni-
balised of engines and inter-
changeable parts, but scrap-
metal is'Stili worth a few bob,
and the use of tank-tracks for
garden-kerbing at depots is a
quaint way for specially and
expensively hardened steel to
spend the evening of its life.
Cannibalism, incidentally, is
rnore of a war-time convenience
for emergencies. Today, when
a part can be got from Ord-
nance with little delay, to
cannibalise it from a complete
article of mechanism starts a
ball rolling that ends in com-
plete gutting and eventual dis-
appearance, much to the
distress of an outgoing C.O.—
Col. Puce (N.S.W.).
Bank Salaries
The general secretary of the
Australian Bank Officials’
Association says that “there was
a time when banking jobs were
sought, but today salaries are
inadequate.”
Bank jobs were sought, and
sought pretty keenly, when the


commencing salary for junior
clerks was in the region of £5O
a year. As for inadequate
salaries, I live in a small town
where there are two branches of
trading-banks, each branch
with a staff of three. As I pass
their offices each day I note
the manager’s large sedan-car,
the accountant-teller’s small
single-seater, and the junior
clerk’s large twin-cylinder
motorbike. If that sort of
display is not evidence of
adequate salaries then I’ll eat
a money-box.
Not so long ago Tma
Bulletin, reviewing the bal-
ance-sheet and profit-and-loss
account of one of the trading-
banks, commented that pay-
ment of dividends was depend-
ing more and more on “the
investment portfolio” and less
on actual banking operations.
The rec e n t hire-purchase
investments by two of the
trading-banks supports The
Bulletin's comment, and I
don’t doubt that satisfactory
dividends could be paid by the
banks if they wound-up their
businesses and dumped all the
proceeds into Commonwealth
Government loans or, better
still, first-class industrial shares.
Collecting interest on Com-
monwealth bonds, or dividend-
cheques, would require a
skeleton-staff employed mainly
in posting out dividend-
warrants to the bank’s share-
holders. Then, where would
the present staff and the 8.0. A.
find themselves? — Harry the

Music
Through the initiative of a
member of the Federated
Music Clubs of Australia
re g U i ar programmes of music

Performance. The success of
tbe music-making has been
enormous and raises the ques-
tlon of musics therapeutical
value ’
In our day we hardly accord
music the importance attached
to it by the ancients. Plato, for
instance, warns against altering
the prevailing type of music ;
if this is done, he insists, then
the existing institutions of the
State are overthrown. Aristotle,
too, maintains that music has
the most profound effect on
the moulding of character —
one kind encourages desirable
qualities, another, undesirable,
Pythagoras and, later, Francis
Bacon also had something to
say concerning the influence of
music on human beings. If
there is anything in such
theories we may well ask
ourselves whether some of the
discord which passes for music
today may not be responsible
for much of the discordancy of
modern life.
The therapeutical use of
music has been the subject of
experiment for quite a time,
and excellent results, particu-
larly among mental cases, are
said to have been achieved.
Certainly the beneficial reac-
tions at Callan Park concerts
suggest that psychiatrists and
others concerned with the
mental health of the nation
might investigate more care-
fully the potentialities of music '
as a healing force for those in
mental distress. The ever-
generous members of the
musical profession will be
ready, as always, to assist a
worthy cause. Maitri

Motor-car Design
This high cost of servicing
modern cars (B. 4/9/’57) has
already been noted by the
Institution of Auto, and Aero.
Engineers (Aust.), the figures
showing that it is absorbing too
great a portion of the national
income.
Men who develop and design
cars seem to attach no import-
ance to the low-cost servicing
of their vehicles as a selling-
point. What is needed to cut
service-costs is a car designed
with a lift-off body, so that the
chassis and the three main
units engine, gearbox and
rear axle—are all exposed and
can be worked on with ease
and with adequate light.
The design would allow for
the dash instruments and panel
to be attached to the chassis,
so that with a small improvised
seat the vehicle could be driven
on its .testing after repairs.
Such a design would cheapen
motoring and make a lot of
people connected with the
motor-trade much happier.—
Tiddles (W.A.).
Tobacco
From “P.O.M.C.’s” remarks
(B. 25/9/’57) I would say that
he has long since passed th“
point where anybody could
convince him of the excellent
smoking qualities of Aus-
tralian leaf. He claims thai
expert opinion holds that the
best Australian leaf lacks the
quality of imported leaf. I’d
like him to name his experts,
either grower or manufacturer
—I don’t doubt that he would
find a consensus of lay opinion
to condemn Australian leaf.
The biggest manufacturer of
cigarettes and tobacco in Au>-
tralia, while naturally
haggling over prices to be paid
for Australian leaf, has never
sweepingly condemned its
quality, as has “P.0.M.C."
Rather, he has made public
statements to the effect that the
company will do all in its
power to foster the growth of
the industry.

hard put to keep production-
costs down. Tobacco is one of
the most looked-after crops in
agriculture, and America uses
mostly cheap black labor, as
does South Africa. I don’t
suggest that Australian wages
should be lowered ; we must
simply develop greater effici-
ency through further
mechanisation and other means.
The whole point is that any
company will buy overseas leaf
at a more attractive price if
there is no Government legis-
lation to prevent it doing so,
and it will justify its actions
with statements similar -to
those of “P.0.M.C.”
To say that Australian leaf
does not retain the moisture
necessary for good smoking,
however, is absurd. I have seen
only reasonable - quality leaf
retain its moisture content for
six years without any
proctorising whatsoever. Proc-
torising is necessary to avoid
over-conditioning, and the
process is not peculiar to Aus-
tralian leaf. Imported leaf goes
through the same process for
the same reasons. In one
country the farmer does the
proctorising, in the other
the manyfacturer does it. —
R. G. V. (Q.).
More Education, More
Scientists
For several years the cry has
been regularly heard that the
West, to survive, must produce
more and more scientists ; and
there are frequent warnings of
the number of scientists being
turned out each year in Russia.
The launching of Sputnik has
redoubled such cries and warn-
ings.
To me it is no real wonder
that the West is falling back
scientifically, if (and 1 think it
is) the approach to education
generally by Government and
the press is the same in other
parts of the free world as in
Australia. That approach, in
short, is one of pinchpenny
meanness, the ignoring of the
needs of education, and
the branding as Communist-
inspired of any attempt to get
a better educational deal.
On June 1 this year, in
Sydney Town Hall, an “Educa-
tion Conference” was held, with
schoolteacher delegates attend-
ing from all over N.S.W.
I was there, and can vouch that
the hall was absolutely and
enthusiastically packed-out.
Organisations supporting the
conference included the
Country Women’s Association,
N.S.W. Council of Churches,
N.S.W. Trades and Labor
Council, Central Committee for
Handicapped Children, Legion
of Ex-Servicemen and Women,
Civilian Maimed and Limbless
Association, N.S.W. Police
Association, Australian Journa-
lists’ Association, Young
Women’s Christian Association,
United Bank Officers’ Associ-
ation of N.S.W. none of
which, and few of the other
supporting bodies, are
“Communist-controlled”!
Several important educa-
tional decisions were made by
the conference —on the need to
remedy school-accommodation
deficiencies, to train more
teachers and staff, and to pro-
vide more finance for educa-
tion.
Barely one reference to this
conference and its decisions
appeared in the Sunday
papers next day or on following
days. The most important
Sydney daily ignored it com-
pletely.
Yet the first step to the pro-
duction of more trained
scientists —experts in any field,
for that matter —is an adequate
and efficient primary-school and
secondary-school system. Aus-
tralia certainly does not possess
such an educational system at
present. In order to catch-up
to the Russians more money
simply must be found for
education.
As for the implication that
those who advocate better
school-facilities must, willy
nilly, be Communists well,
surely the Communist would
prefer to see Russia stay in the
scientific lead and would
therefore be hardly likely to be
advocating what, if carried out,
would tend to reduce that lead?
—K. R. (N.S.W.).
It is not altogether surprising
that Russia is beginning to lead
the world in scientific develop-
ment. It is one of the few
countries which have con-
sciously fostered the conditions
most suitable for experiment
and research.
We naturally expect our best
intellects to remain at or con-
nected with our. universities.
Indeed, any other system
requires expensive duplication
of facilities, and also deprives
smaller groups of research-
workers of the salutary
criticisms and assistance of
their colleagues.
Yet advertisements calling for
university tutors at an annual
salary of £9OO are still common.
Moreover, anyone so unwise as
to accept such an appointment
will find that the teaching staff
is so inadequate that he must
either abandon any hope of
individual research, or skimp
his teaching obligations.
Research-scholarships uncon-
nected with teaching activities
are very rare.
Nobody expects Australia to
lead the world in research ; it
lacks both the men and the
resources. But there is increas-
ing evidence that we are not
even keeping pace, and this has
important implications in both
economic welfare and defence.
A competent scientist should be
at least as valuable to Australia
as a senior Army officer. —

By “LOWANA”
Beef-cattle
T OOKING at the condition
■*-' of the 800-odd high-quality
beef-cattle circling the rings on
the opening day of Melbourne’s
1957 Royal Show, it was hard
to believe in the extremely dry
autumn and winter throughout
much of southern Australia.
Under almost perfect con-
ditions, after a few days of
wet, squally weather, the
judges selected the winners
before crowds whose interest
was maintained until it was
almost too dark to see.
This year the parade was
led by a record entry of Aber-
deen Angus cattle, which were
judged by A. Beddie, of Aber-
deenshire, Scotland. The other
judge from oversea was A. F.
Paton, of Somerset, England,
who sorted out the Devons.
Outstanding features of the
beef-breed competitions were:
• The unusual success of
young cattle, which gained
several senior championships.
In other cases, the junior

champion filled the senior-
reserve position.
• The notable influence of
imported sires, especially in the
Aberdeen Angus breed.
• The marked progress of
several breeds, notably the
Polled Hereford, towards the
modern low-set type, without
any loss of walking ability.
• The fact that, in only a

few cases, did one owner
dominate the prizes in his
breed. Most awards were well
distributed.
Aberdeen Angus
The main Scottish
judge found in the "black cattle
were a tendency to weakness
in the head, and some legginess
—the last, perhaps, not very
surprising in a country where
conditions are very different
from the fields of mid-Scotland;
some of the preparation was
overdone, with consequent loss
of soft-handling qualities, and
the judge found a “tail” in
some of the larger classes, but
he was very pleased with many
of the younger cattle.
In fact, he raised many ring-
side eyebrows when he picked
a youngster to carry both the
senior and junior championship
sashes for bulls. This attractive,
well-put-together sire, Suther-
land David, was exhibited by
John Jackson, of Romsey
(Vic.), a comparative newcomer
to open competition.
Sutherland David was sired
by Gwedor of Addington,
which Mr. Jackson imported
after spending several months
studying the breed in the U.K.
The senior reserve-champion-
ship went to Mt. William
Trumps, which was exhibited
by Mrs. W. J. R. Wilson, of
Lancefield, not far from the
Jackson property.
The junior reserve-champion,
Woolamia Black Envoy, also
had imported blood. Owned by
E. C. and B. L. Hawkins and
Sons, of Tocumwal (N.S.W.),
the youngster was sired by
Black Sailor of Broomhall.
The champion cow, Terri-
nallum Gem 111, exhibited by
V. and R. McDonald, of Caven-
dish (Vic.), was bred 'by
Terrinallum Pastoral Co.; she
is by the famous imported sire
Black Idol of Mangatoro.
Mr. Jackson again scored
'Well with Sutherland Fancy
(also by Gwedor of Addington),
which captured both the junior
championship and senior
reserve-championship.
The junior-female reserve-
championship went to Home-
wood Gail, paraded by T. H.
Wood, of Moolap, near Gee-
long (Vic.).
Other Aberdeen Angus
breeders to win blue ribbons
included Reynolds Investments
Pty., Ltd., of Ballarat; L. J.
and A. L. Graves, of Battery
Park, Mansfield ; Lindsay H.
Drake, of Terang ; S. G. Green-
slade, of Tatura, and W. B.
Boothby, of Peechelba East.
Poll Herefords
G. E. Kirkby, of Moree
(N.S.W.), who owns the largest
Poll Hereford stud in Aus-
tralia and who adjudicated at
Melbourne, said the parade was
the best he had ever seen in
Australia.
He was particularly pleased
with the progress towards the
modern type and the way in
which the tops walked. The
entry was also characterised by
evenness.
Another pleasing feature was
the fleshing, with no evidence of
the preparation being over-
done. Major awards in this
breed were well distributed.
The champion bull, Bre-
warrana Gallant 111, exhibited
by W. J. Lenehan, of Nar-
randera (N.S.W.), had a beau-
tiful head, body and thighs, and
was an excellent walker.
It won narrowly from the
junior champion, R. L. Mc-
Eachern’s (Strathdownie)
Ardno Barrister, which was
carrying some of the well-
known Wantabadgery blood,
which scored so well in Mel-
bourne several years ago.
The junior reserve-champion,
Springfield Belle Boy, was
another promising youngster
shown by S. T. Hawkins, of
Finley (N.S.W.).
Mr. Hawkins also scored in
the open female-championship
with Springfield Maritana 111,
which had a beautiful breeding
body, typical female head, and
well-placed udder.
Again the reserve open award
went to the junior champion—
Mr. Lenehan’s B. Bluebell,
which, like the champion bull,
was sired by B. Domino. The
reserve-champion heifer ribbon
went to Deepfields Empress
IV, from K. G. Luke’s stud at
Romsey, which has been one
of the outstanding centres of
the breed during the past few
years.
Other successful Poll Here-
ford breeders included J. A.
and D. J. Hansen, of Mac-
arthur, T. R. Trewin, of Tally-
garoopna, and Dookie Agri-
cultural College.
Herefords
Another “best ever” display
was given by the Herefords.
The judge, S. B. Reynolds, of
Rosalie Plains (Q.), said that
the entry compared very favor-
ably with those normally seen
at Brisbane and Sydney. He
was specially impressed by the
youngsters of both sexes.
Jim Allen, of South Boorook,
Mortlake (Vic.), continued his
remarkable record by exhibit-
ing the champion bull for the
sixth time since 1950. This

N.S.W.) into reserve place for
both senior and junior cham-
pionships.
Major awards among the
Hereford females also went to
the junior champions. Although
a little light in color, C. R.
Malseed’s (Dartmoor, Vic.)
Ascot Winifred IV, by Bramp-
ton Do-a-Bit (imp.), showed
great squareness and fleshing
to beat R. L. McEachern's
(Strathdownie, Vic.) Ardno
Gladiola, by Tarrington
Spokesman (imp.), into second
place for both championships.
Other successful Hereford
breeders included F. M.
Mac Diamond and Sons, of
Queanbeyan (N.S.W.), William
Peatt Pty., Ltd., of Coleraine
(Vic.), and J. E. de Little, of
Caramut (Vic.).
Shorthorns
Young classes were also in
evidence among the strong
showing of Shorthorns. The
judge, C. H. Bennett, of West-
bury (Tas.), praised the quality
and evenness of the Shorthorns.
As with the Herefords, the
junior-champion and reserve-
champion bulls also took the
major honors. The champion,
Kyalla Pty., Ltd.’s, Greenwich
Iron Monarch, from Towrang
(N.S.W.), had all the qualities
of a leading sire.
Although outstanding, he
was not very far ahead of the
reserve winner, ICIANZ,
exhibited by 1.C.1.A.N.Z., of
Deer Park. Among the females
the main award-winners also
came from the junior ranks.
Many people thought that the
champion, Kelso Broadhooks
Rose—an 18-month-old red
roan sired by the imported
Erimus Horatio —was the best
female of the breed ever to
appear at Melbourne. She
showed all the promise of
developing into an outstanding
quick-maturing Shorthorn.
Although outstanding, this
youngster was little ahead of
the reserve champion, Wongala
Pancake, exhibited by J.
Kemelfield, of Woodend.
Among several other successful
breeders were Sir Rupert
Clarke, of Clarkefield, Thomas
Falls, of Dingee, G. L. Barker,
of Woodend, and Alberni
Bros., of Ferntree Gully.
Poll Shorthorns
After an excellent showing in
Sydney before a U.S.A. judge,
Poll Shorthorns were very
disappointing. Only 14 entries
faced the judge, George
Starritt, of North Mooroopna.
All major awards except one
went to Merryville Pty., Ltd.,
of Murrumbateman (N.S.W.).
Kyalla Pty., Ltd., of Towrang
(N.S.W.), won the ribbon for
the heifer reserve-champion-
ship.
Merryville’s champion bull,
Merryville Laddie 111, sired by
Woomargama Quiberon,.had a
splendid head and displayed
gieat substance and fleshing.
The reserve senior-champion,
which was also the junior
champion, Merryville Monarch,
was a very well-developed
youngster.
Devons
Although also small
numerically, Devons displayed
excellent quality which pleased
the overseas judge, A. F. Paton,
of Somerset (Eng.). A very
successful exhibitor was Mrs.
Janet M. Officer, of Warrnam-
bool, who paraded the junior-
champion bull, Kilmorey South
Servant XIV, and the
champion and reserve-
champion heifers, K.S. Gentle
and K.S. Cowslip—both of the
same age and by Havilah Civil
Servant XXVIII.
Table Top Estate, Table Top
(N.S.W.), captured both male
reserve - championships, and
A. A. Laidlaw, of Ararat (Vic.),
exhibited the champion and
reserve-champion cow and the
champion bull.
Imported blood was evident
in several of the major prize-
winners in this breed, which is
making definite advances at
Melbourne.
Dual-purpose Breeds
The Red Polls showed
definite strength in the breed,
despite a slight numerical
decline. The females main-
tained their - high standard
particularly well.
The champion cow, Plymouth
Kodaklass, entered by Wilson
G. J. Beer and Sons, of
Nanneella South, had a nice
breeding body and good
balance, while retaining the
desirable dairy qualities.
In reserve position was the
typey Burnwood Mary, bred by
John Mclntosh and Son Pty.,
Ltd., of Merrigum, who can
boast a long list of successes
with this breed at Melbourne.
The champion and reserve-
champion heifers were shown
by T. and W. McDonald, of
Kyabram, and Wilson Beer and
Sons, respectively.
Outstanding feature among
the bulls was the victory of the
famous Bundaleer Bombproof,
bred by Perry Bros., of
Goul b u r n (N.S.W.), and
exhibited by W. J. Craig, of
Kerang, which won its fifth
Melbourne Show champion-
ship in six years.
As last year, it beat into
reserve position Larkhill Imper-
turbable, bred by Brigadier
G. S. Hurst and paraded by
Mr. T. E. N. Payne, of
Kilmore. Mr. Craig won the
junior championship and
reserve championship with
Ilomelea Broadwood and
Drumclog Stuart II respectively.
Dairy Shorthorns
The display of Dairy Short-
horns was the best that the
judge, Harry Sutton, of Boort,
had seen in his long association
with the breed. Heads, fleshing
and evenness impressed him
particularly.
It was notable that the
champion bull, Willow Park
Gay Lord XXI, bred by
Atkinson Bros., of Swan Hill,
and exhibited by I. and R.
McDonald, of Castlemaine,
beat two imported bulls, includ-
ing its own sire.
The champion’s sire, Kelm-
scott Gay Lord 73, bred by Mr.
R. R. Hobbs in England from
K. Gay Baron XXIV, and
exhibited by Atkinson Bros.,
was reserve champion. This
beautiful animal was also sire
of the junior champion and
reserve champion and of the
teserve-champion heifer and
several other class winners. He
seems to be having a similar
beneficial influence on the
breed in Australia to Churchill
Paradox. The latter is getting
on, but his influence Can still be
seen; and, among this year’s
entries, he was sire of the
reserve-champion cow and the
best group of three females,
The junior-champion bull,
W.P. Gay Lord 49, was very
compact, had a beautiful head,
and was smaller than the older
reserve champion, W.P. Gay
Lord 44, which had the sub-
stance but not quite the quality
of its victor,
Although it missed a major
placing, Orma Statesman, bred
by D. Jopson, of England, and
exhibited by John Muir and
Sons, of Bacchus Marsh, caught
the judge’s eye and won a blue-
ribbon in its class,
The champion cow, Nara
Moonbeam, paraded by Phillip
Callahan, of Barwon Downs,
had a beautiful head, breeding
body, vessel and teat-placing.
The reserve champion, W.P.
Rosebud, bred and exhibited by
Atkinson Bros., had the dis-
advantage of being in
production.
The chunky white Green
Meadows Nora, by the
imported Parsenn Viscount
Wildeyes, and exhibited by
McCombe Bros., of Horsham,
carried too many good points
for the rest of the field in the
heifer championship,
Reserve champion was W.P
Blush, from Atkinson Bros.’
stud. L. E. Paddle,* of North
Fitzroy, T. Gass, of Koyuga,
and Kerr Bros., of Bacchus

Marsh, were among the other
successful exhibitors.
Mr. Sutton said that he was
very impressed with the under-
lines as well as the toplines of
the cattle which paraded before
him.
Dairy Breeds
Again, there was little evi-
dence of the dry season to be
seen in the dairy cattle at Mel-
bourne ; in fact, many of
Victoria’s dairying districts
appreciate a dry winter, especi-
ally after the particularly wet
conditions of 1956.
The two outstanding cows
were the Friesian champion,
A. W. Pitt’s Robinlyn Joyce,
which won the “Best Cow in
the Show” award, and King’s
Vale Jessemia, which won the
Jersey championship for J.
Anderson and Sons, of Lynd-
hurst, whose stud is the oldest
of the breed in Victoria.
Although showing a lot of
white color, the “Best Cow,”
which grazes at Mooroolbark,
had enough excellent qualities
to be the best of a number of
good females.
Jerseys
The champion Jersey cow
was one of the best of the breed
to .appear in Melbourne for a
long time.
With 588 entries, the Jerseys
again had by far the strongest
representation, and com-
manded keen interest from the
ringside in what a long
day of judging for E. W.
Flower, of Binnaburra
(N.S.W.).
Although many big classes
came before him, he often had
difficulty in picking out the
top six or seven for the final
selection, so good was the
quality right down the line.
Beautiful type and quality,
plus an almost perfect vessel,
won the reserve championship
for Berry Bank Love Kiss 11,
exhibited by W. S. Dreschler, of
Swan Hill.
The final line-up of bulls was
also a very attractive offering,
from which Mr. Flower selected
for the championship award
the typey, smooth-walking
Kameruka Mistletoe’s Draco-
nian, bred on the Kameruka
Estate (N.S.W.), and exhibited
by K. Grant, of Drouin (Vic.).
Good depth and type won
the reserve sash for the com-
pact, younger, Bermersyde
William, exhibited by G. and
R. Cox, of Murraydale, near
Swan Hill. This bull was sired
by Belgonia Noella IV's Noble
Jester, from one of P. J.
Maloney's (Tongala) famous
dairying families.
Other prizes in the Jersey
classes were well distributed
among Sylvia Askew, of Sale,
and F. W. Ducat, of Ardmona ;
P. J. Maloney ; R. C. Broad, of
Sutton Grange ; F. A. Burg-
man, of Katandra West ; F. M.
Swift and Sons, of Malmsbury ;
and W. J. Clark, of Mono-
meith.
Guernseys
The Guernseys put on their
best display for several years.
As an aged cow, the cham-
pion—Avon View Dot’s ll’s
Glory, paraded by Dr. F. G.
Stephens, of Vermont —•
exhibited wonderful stamina in
maintaining such excellent all-
over conformation in spite of
a heavy production record.
The reserve champion
champion last year—was under
the disadvantage of being dry.
It was R. G. Watson’s (Frank-
ston) Overport Viola, which
was sired by the imported
Worthy Robert VIII.
H. Pilgrim, of Horsley
(N.S.W.), who adjudicated, also
selected an aged entry for the
bull championship. This classy
sire, Vermont Ideal, bred by
Dr. Stephens and exhibited by
1. R. Fitzgerald, of Nunawad-
ing, has a remarkably good and
consistent record in the Mel-
bourne show-ring.
It won this year’s honor from
Claremont Enchanter, which
was paraded by the Claremont
stud, of Rochester.
Other successful Guernsey
breeders included C. E. Sach,
of Doreen; H. W. R. Troutbeck,
REPORT FROM CROHAMHURST
(3/10/’57)
Queensland should get light to moderate, patchy rains
during November, although reasonably good rains may
occur on part of the south coast and Darling Downs. Good
general rains are likely in December.
N.S.W. should also get patchy rainfall during November,
although moderate rains, mainly below normal, should occur
on the coast, tablelands and north-west slopes and plains.
Good general rains are indicated during December, with
heavy falls in the northern areas of the State.
Moderate to reasonably good rains likely in Victoria
during November, although part of the northern division
and Mallee confined to light rain. December should be a
month of patchy rainfall, with the best falls occurring in
the southern half of the State.
The central agricultural areas of South Australia should
receive reasonably good rains during November, but the
Murray Valley, west coast, interior and upper north may get
only light, patchy rains.
Moderate to good rains likely in the south-west corner
of Western Australia during November. Apart from fair
rains in the East Kimberleys, rainfall likely to be poor else-
where in the State.

Friesians
In addition to providing the
Best Cow in the Show, the
Friesians maintained good con-
formation right through most
classes. For the reserve-
champion cow, A. S. R.
Shearer, of Singleton (N.S.W.),
selected the attractive Gala-
view Political Rejoy, exhibited
by J. V. Plattfuss, of Finley
(N.S.W.).
The bull championship went
to the well-known V. J.
Lamond (Nowra, N.S.W.) four-
year-old Brun d e e Lunla
Romeo, whose best features
were its head, depth, and good
flank. J. J. and N. M. Dawson,
of Pearcedale, won the reserve
championship with Willandra
Pioneer.

G. L. S. Cowan and Sons, of
Bacchus Marsh ; A. K. Ashen-
den, of Strathmerton, and Jack
Burgman, of Katandra West,
also won blue-ribbons.
Ayrshires
After breaking their remark-
able post-war run of successes
with the Ayrshire bull cham-
pionship last year, A. Facey
and Sons, of Millicent (S.A.),
recaptured the sash with Glen-
gowrie Baron Willie 11, who
just failed last year to J. H
Goddard and Son’s good-doing
Scottish Hero from Cora Lynn,
which filled the reserve position
this year.
The Goddards captured the
female championship with the
six-year-old Inverurie Countess
11, which had great balance and
an excellent topline. Like
Ayrshires in general, this
champion had an excellent
vessel.
The judge, C. J. Clark, of
Minto (N.S.W.), was specially
pleased with this feature. The
reserve champion, Mill Springs
Lady Marie, was exhibited by
J. M. Robertson, of Shepherd's
Flat. Glengowrie blood con-
tributed to this typey dam's
performance.
In a very even showing, other
successful exhibitors included
J. M. Buchanan and Son, of
Flinders ; G. V. Bingham, of
Lardner; Flanagan Bros., of
Melton; W. S, Skinner, of
Heidelberg; L. Battley, of
Trafalgar; J. M. Drane, of
Traralgon ; and V. T. Canobie,
of Dandenong.
Mr. Clark’s amplified
comments on each group were
very helpful.
A.I.S.
As last year, there was an
excellent line-up of Australian
Illawarra Shorthorns. Young-
sters were prominent, but the
judge, H. W. Gray, of Alston-
ville (N.S.W.), found a “tail”
and inadequate preparation in
some classes.
Although a little on the small
side, the champion cow, Good-
woode Park Pearl, exhibited by
B. A. Goode, of Coldstream,
had an excellent vessel and was
of the good milk-producing
type.
In reserve position was A. E.
Story’s (Emu Creek, near
Bendigo) Elsandale Lottie.
Nice quality and soft handle
were major features of the
champion bull, Nandowra
Butter King, paraded by A. M.
Chambers, of Warrnambool,
which forced a promising three-
year-old, Yelgdim Big Shot,
entered by R. G. Newman and
Sons, of Pirron Yallock, into
the reserve placing.
The judge forecast a great
future for the latter bull, which
had an excellent head and
wonderful balance.
Good successes were recorded
also by Mrs. J. Hill and Sons,
of Streatham; Bott Bros., of
Dingwall, near Kerang; H.
Andrew, of Numurkah ; J. M.
and L. D. Barry, of Mortlake ;
and N. M. Newton, of
Whorouly.


Women’s Letters
MELBOURNE
Doris Margaret, eldest daughter of
Archbishop J. J. Booth and Mrs. Booth,
was a lovely bride when she exchanged
vows with Dr. Harold Norman Tucker,
of South Australia, at a fully choral ser-
vice in St. Paul’s Cathedral, at which her
father officiated, assisted by the Rev. G.
Kircher. Her gown, of ivory satin-brocade
woven with small sprays of flowers in
silver thread, featured a scalloped neck-
line and a very full skirt extending into a
graceful train. A plaited circlet of ivory
satin-brocade held the waist-length veil,
and she carried a bouquet of stephanotis
and gardenias. The bride’s sister Patricia
attended her, wearing blue and silver
brocade fashioned on Empire lines, with
a scalloped neckline to match her sister’s
gown. She also wore a circlet of the
dress-material, hers being finished with
a spray of leaves across the back. Mr.
Howard Tucker was best man. Recep-
tion was at 9 Darling Street, South Yarra.

Wearing her clothes as only a French-
woman can, slim, attractive, auburn-
haired Madame Helene Burollaud was
the centre of attraction at a cocktail and
buffet-dinner party at the Hotel Australia.
As style-manager and director of Harriet
Hubbard Ayer, of Paris, Madame is here
as part of a six-weeks’ flying trip around
the world, on which she is launching a
new beauty-preparation. Two special
guests were the Director of the National
Gallery (Mr. Eric Westbrook) and the
Keeper of the Prints (Dr. Ursula Hoff),
for Madame Burollaud is a notable art-
collector. The guest-of-honor wore a
Pierre Balmain cocktail-dress of dark
anthracite-grey silk-faille, the bodice cut
high at the front, the round neckline cut
in a deep back V. With it she wore a
small cap of black-tipped white feathers,
designed for her by Claud Saint Cyr.

40 friends at her parents home last Satur-
day celebrated the engagement.
Brighton Town Hall featured a snow-
theme when the Arlberg Ski Club from
Mt. Buffer held its annual ball. There
were ski-motifs on the walls, and on each
table were candles and “snow”-covered
pine-trees. The 250 guests were welcomed
by the principal of the ski-school, Max
Otter, and his mother, Mrs. E. Strolz, and
ticket-secretary Mrs. J. Young and her
husband. The ball served also as a fare-
well for Peppi Gramshammer, a ski-
instructor for the recent season at Mt.
Buffer, who returns home to Austria this
week to prepare for the world ski-
championships to be held next January.
As a parting gift, members of the club

A frock created by English designer
Frederick Starke was flown from London
for the mannequin-parade held at the
Hotel Australia by British Nylon Spinners
(Australia). Elegant and formal, the frock
was of white nylon coin-spotted in black •
the fichu-draped bodice was new, and
floating panels gave movement to a skirt
cut on sheath-lines. There were also
nylons in floral designs (all made in Aus-
tralia) suitable for women’s and children’s
wear. A three-piece play-suit of stretch-
nylon featured tapered slacks which
buttoned to modified bloomer-type shorts,
and a casual top —all of striped stretch-
nylon.
This stretch-nylon is ideal, for it will
not sag or bag, yet allows complete
freedom of movement. Silicone-treated
brushed-nylon was used to make a
striking emerald-green Parka, suitable for
ski-wear or after-ski lounging. Silicone-
proofed nylon was also used for a
reversible raincoat ; as well as making the
fabric water-repellent silicone gives an
added “feel” to the soft and velvety
fabric. Tycora nylon and Ban Lon nylon
are among the new textured yarns. They
give an opaque fabric the soft, luxurious
feel of cashmere. Very attractive was a
“brunch”-coat of pale-blue floral quilted
nylon-tricot, a material which launders
excellently and is soft and supple.

CANBERRA
The Prime Minister and Dame Pattie
Menzies were among the many guests
received by the Minister for China and
Madame Chen Tai Chu at a late-
afternoon reception at the Hotel Canberra
in celebration of China’s National Day.
The muted blue-and-gold decor of the
reception-rooms, newly completed, was
enhanced by massed arrangements of
gladioli and delphiniums, and a huge
Chinese flag lent an appropriate
atmosphere to the occasion.
Among the diplomats present were the
High Commissioner for New Zealand
and Mrs. Alderton ; the High Commis-
sioner for Canada and Mrs. Mac Dermo t;
and the German Ambassador and Mrs.
Hess. Other guests included Mr. and Mrs.
P. S. McGovern; Senator Agnes

Tony Inmans (who were accompanied by
Mrs. Inman’s sister, Mrs. F. R. Fay, of
Hobart); and Mr. and Mrs. E. K. Geach.
“The Satellite” was, inevitably, a topic
of conversation, and one diplomat caused
amusement by asking what the Depart-

about it, and whether Australia intended
to establish diplomatic relations with our
new asteroid neighbor,


SYDNEY
The Black and White Ball stands out
among the many lively happenings round
town this week. Over 1400 people
trooped along to it, and the decor
practically took the sight out of their
eyes. There was scarcely an inch of
the Trocadero unadorned by such
sumptuous items as enormous white
swans in marabou with silver crowns
and flowers on their heads, glittering
silver birds in ebony cages, hanging
baskets of black-and-white ostrich-plumes,
huge black-and-white disks suspended
from the ceiling (satellites?), and specially
painted screens featuring Australian
birds. One woman went round early
in the piece saying in an awe-stricken
way: “But think of the work that has
gone into this, the work!” Mrs. Noel
Vincent and Mrs. Dick Allen were in
charge of the decor, by the way.
There was much also to note in the
beauteous dresses worn. The dress of
the president (Mrs. Marcel Dekyvere)
was soft white chiffon, floor-length at
the back and floating to ankle-length in
front. Mrs. Colin Ryrie looked chic
and Edwardian in a strapless sheath-
gown of black chiffon. Judy Barraclough,
in a short black Dior model, was the
only woman game enough to w'ear a hat to
a ball (but, then, it was only a very little
hat). Madame Rene Peix’s beautiful
draped white jersey had a neckline that
plunged to the waist, Mrs. Bob Mclnerney
glided by in a white swanlike confec-
tion, Mrs. A. Joris had intriguing little
ermine shoulder-caps on her white satin
dress.
Mrs. Michael Jones, in white chiffon,
won the prize for the most beautiful
dress (married ladies) and Genelle Hinch-
cliffe, in white satin, that for single
girls. The proceeds from the ball will
go to the Royal Blind Society.

Hyde Park has been very gay during
the week with a merry-go-round, jazz-
bands, mannequin-parades, folk-dancing,
cooking demonstrations, etc. —something
happening all the time. It was all part
of the Waratah Spring Festival, which
seems to be very successful with those
who take part in it, and to be quite
unknown to those who don’t. The
procession drew large crowds into the
city and was a very fine spectacle three
miles long. There were 62 floats and 90
other units, including Chinese-dragons,
vintage-cars, New Australians in national
dress, as well as 30 bands, 600 troops
from the Army and Air Force, mounted
police carrying lances, Girl Guides, Boy
Scouts and the Waratah Princess, pretty
17-year-old Colleen Pike, wearing
£50,000-worth of jewellery and riding in
a golden (painted) sports-car.

Mr. David Condon, Information
Officer for the U.K., enlightened many
of us on the subject of social services in
England when he spoke at a luncheon
at the Y.W.C.A. on Wednesday.
Apparently the Welfare State is quite a
good state to be in, and the thought of
those three-million houses built since
the war (the local councils will lend you
95 per cent, of the cost if you want to
build) made our own effort seem very
meagre. A questioner asked whether it
was not unfair that visitors to England
(from France or Ireland, for instance)
should be given the same free services
that the English themselves received, but
Mr. Condon pointed out that it was
cheaper to give the same services to
all-comers than to have two types, which
would necessitate many more records.
“Besides,” he added, “it’s a good
advertisement!” Mrs. Neville Harding
introduced Mr. Condon. Director of
Education Dr. H. S. Wyndham was
present, and Miss Joyce McMillan moved
a vote of thanks to the speaker.
Seventeen-year-old Pamela Ingleby set
off during the week by B.O.A.C. for
Fribourg, Switzerland. She is to be in
residence at Villa Beata Finishing School
for the academic year due to begin
yesterday (October 15), and will take an
Arts course at Fribourg University. Her
plans include a skiing holiday at
Christmas, a visit to Rome at Easter and,
at the close of her university year, a
month in London and a month in Paris.
Pamela is the granddaughter of Bernard
Ingleby, who contributed regularly to
THE BULLETIN (as well as the “Lone
Hand”) about the turn of the century;
his poems, published in the ’twenties, are
practically all acknowledged to The
Bully. The purpose of Pamela’s travels
abroad is to perfect her languages —
French and Italian.
Dame Flora MacLeod of MacLeod has
returned for her second visit to Aus-
tralia (she was here in 1954), and was
greeted at a “Welcome Ceilidh” by 500
of her clansfold at the Trocadero on
Saturday. The official table was decorated
by clan-member Mrs. A. E. Bailey
(Ashfield), who combined thistles
(specially grown in the country) with
wattle as the chief motif, and in the
centre of the table was a replica of
Dame Flora’s home, Dunvegan Castle,
on the Isle of Skye. Dame Flora
interrupted her Victorian tour to attend
this gathering, which is part of the clan’s
annual MacLeod Week. Her only
private engagement while in Sydney will
be a buffet-tea at the home of Mr. and
Mrs. Bruce MacLeod at North Sydney.

Richard Beynon, author of the play
“The Shifting Heart,” was guest-speaker
at the fifth Literary Luncheon arranged
to aid the N.S.W. Society for Crippled
Children. Mr. Beynon suggested that
Australians had a special quality to offer
the world in their artistic efforts —the
quality of virility which we have
developed because of our closeness to
pioneer times, when everything had to
be sacrificed to the sheer need to exist.
There was a very good attendance at
this luncheon —apparently the committee
has built up a regular group of people
who keep the second Tuesday of each
month as a special luncheon-date. The
speakers so far have been very stimula-
ting and the gatherings very enjoyable.

It was celebration-week for the Chinese
community in Sydney with the Double
10th —i.e., the 10th of October, which
commemorates the overthrow of the
Manchu dynasty and the establishment of
the Chinese Republic 46 years ago. All
through the day it was open-house at the
Chinese Consulate, and many called there
to congratulate Consul-General S. H.
Sih and Mrs. Sih on the celebration. The
previous evening the Consul-General
and Mrs. Sih had been present at a dance
at the State Ballroom, when they were
welcomed by Mrs. W. Oong, and on the
10th itself they gave a reception for
nearly 500 people at the Cairo Inter-
national Restaurant in Macleay Street.

Noted that “Limbo dancing” was a
part of the daily festivities in Hyde
Park. It reminds one of the horse in
the Black and White Derby, which was
called Rock ’n’ Roll (by Limbs out of
Control).

Air-Vice-Marshal A. L. Walters and
Mrs. Walters, who have now left Sydney
to live once more in Melbourne (the
A.-V.-M. has been appointed Air
Member for Personnel on the Air Board),
were at the Black and White Ball, Mrs.
Walters handsome in white lace. The
following day they were guests-of-honor
at a luncheon at the Overseas League ;
and on Friday, at a cocktail-party held
at the officers’ mess, Glenbrook, they
said good-bye to a number of the wide
group of friends that they have made
during their stay here.

Of course, all the talk during the week
was about the satellite —it was hard to
get a word in edgeways about the “sack”
or the sou’wester, or even the price of
tea (which defies the law of gravity
because it goes up but it doesn’t come
down). The satellite has brought a new
verb into the language, “to orbit,” which
presumably means to go round and round.
It should be useful in describing how one
feels sometimes.


disciple; he opened his heart
to him.
“I’ve never loved anyone,”
he said. “No one has ever
loved me. Love doesn’t exist.
Greed, selfishness, desire to
possess another, to make it part
of yourself —that exists. Call
that love if you like, and what
have you got? Sally and me.
Love 1”
murmured Sally’s
praises.
“You’re a f o o 1,” said
Alfredo with a frankness he
rarely showed to paying-
drinkers. “You’re my friend,
and a fool. She’s a woman,
that’s all. They’re all the same,
but they have different shapes.
Some pose better than others.
Some suit your mood. That’s
all you can hope for. Now,
there’s a girl at the Tech. —
big thighs, pin-head, almost
symbolic. If I could get her
to pose ... I’d like to do a
nude. Sally’s made me conven-
tional.”
“Why don’t you paint Sally?”
“I’ve painted Sally.”
“Well, get on to Pinhead.”
“Sally won’t let me. And
Pinhead talks marriage.”
“Do you want to marry
her?”
“Want?” said Alfredo.
“What has my want to do with
it; I’m a man, not a woman.
If I hadn’t my art they’d have
crushed me by now.”
“I thought you were
interested in Marion. What
about her?”
“All primary colors! I
couldn’t do it. She started to
pose, but Sally put her foot
down —right in my mouth, the
bitch! I didn’t even know she
was in the house. But I bit it.
I bit hard. She had to put
some peroxide on it. Serve her
right!”
“Would you —would you
marry this Pinhead?”
Nicholas was thinking of
Sally with naked feet.
“I’ve married others,” said
Alfredo gloomily.
“Then, why don’t you?”
“Sally.”
“You could go away. You
and Pinhead.”
“Where?” said Alfredo.
“Tahiti?” he suggested Sarcas-
tically. “Like Gauguin?”
But his tone had changed.
He leant on the bar and looked
like Gauguin.
“Yes,” said Nicholas, seiz-
ing the moment. “Like
Gauguin.” He thought about
Alfredo and Pinhead and
animal women, like Gauguin.
“Why not Tahiti?”
“Money,” said Alfredo, back
in Sydney and reality.
“I could” Nicholas
stopped his eagerness. “I could
give you your fare to Brisbane.
It’s on the way north.”
“Give?”
“Lend if you like. You could
pay me when you sold a
picture. It’d be a sort of invest-
ment,”
“Of course,” said Alfredo,
“you’d have to wait. All the
money I made at first would
have to go towards my fare to
Tahiti.”
“Of course,” said Nicholas.
TIE was working at the time
as a cleaner, seven to
twelve, three nights a week,
and it gave him enough money.
He married Alfredo and his
Pinhead off at ten on a Tuesday
morning in the Registry Office.
He paid the fee. He went with
them in a taxi to the station.
He saw them safely on the
train. He paid the fare. He
made Alfredo promise to write
to Sally from Brisbane. He
waved good-bye.
The following Friday he
turned up at Marion’s party.
Sally was there.
“Where’s Alfredo?” he asked
her.
“Bastard,” she said. “All
men are the same. He’s
married some art-student
floozie and zoomed her off to
Queensland. All men are
cowards.”
“Have a dr i n k,” said
Nicholas.
“You’re nice, Nick,” she
said.
No one had ever called him
Nick before. She might never
call him Nick again. He had
to make the most of his chance.
He gave her a gin-and-whisky.
“I’ve liked you for a long
time,” she said. “You’re a
good friend.”
A nineteen-year-old with a
pony-tail and an intense accent
steered towards them. “Oh,
Nicholas, dear,” she was say-
ing, “I want to talk to you
about the new Camus.” He
ignored her and poured Sally
another drink. He stared at
her as she drank it.
“I’d have done anything for
him,” she said. “You should
see the letter he wrote me.”
“Nicholas,” called Marion
from somewhere in the crowd.
“Come and say good-night to
little Kerry. You know how
fond she is of you.”
“Nick,” Sally was saying.
“Nicholas, Nick.”
Nicholas stared at her,
frankly, appraisingly, as
obviously as he could. He
stopped himself from saying
that he loved her.
“I want you,” he said.
“Why not, Nick?” said
Sally. “All men are the same.
Look at them.”
He didn’t turn his eyes. He
knew what Marion’s parties
looked like. He went on
staring, and—really—now that
the game had started, the
barrier was down, he felt
animal, indifferent, sure of
himself.
“All right,” she said. “Come
on.”
THEY lay on Marion’s
A double-bed and smoked
cigarettes. Sally was drawing
deeply at hers, but Nicholas
was gasping quickly and
timidly at his. The effort of
pushing the smoke from his
mouth exhausted him, but
pleasantly.
He lay there, watching the
smoke, thinking in a sort of a
way about Sally, and hardly
listening to what she was say-
ing:
“The animal! Shacking up
with a kid like that! He’ll come
bouncing back. She’s too
young to wipe his nose. Good-
luck for me if he doesn’t! I’ll
leave work tomorrow.”
“Why don’t you move in
with me?” said Nicholas. “The
place is big enough for two.
It’ll be cheaper.”
“Platonically?” she said.
“As platonically as we like.”
“Do you want me to, Nick?
You do want me to?”
“Yes.”
Sally moved in and Nicholas
got a full-time job as a service-
station attendant. He had to
wear a uniform. He had to be
there on time. He had to call
car-owners “sir.” He wasn’t
allowed to say, “How much?”
He had to say, “Fill her up,
s : r?” and look keen. They
were very strict about him
looking keen. “I can’t stand
it,” he used to say. Ail day he
seemed to be saying that he
couldn’t stand it.
He’d go home to the flat—
a small room with a small
balcony, small for two —and it
was Sally’s clothes lying
around the place and Sally sit-
ting on the floor among the
cigarette-butts painting her toe-
nails that made it not matter.
“Hi,” she’d say with no
excitement and he’d jump at
her to force her to be interested.
“Animal,” he called her, and
as he said it he wondered at
himself and was glad.
But it could hardly last.
There were people he wanted
to talk to, places he wanted to
go, and Sally didn’t care to go
with him. He could hardly
have talked to his cultured
women if she had. But she
just didn’t care whether he was
in or out. She never asked him
where he had been, wasn’t corn
cerned. It was nothing to do
with her.
He came home to her every
night, then, and stayed there.
He tried to work, to write.
“Don’t talk to me,” he’d say.
Sally didn’t. “I can’t discuss it
with you.” Sally didn’t try.
“Don’t you love me?”
He knew the answer.
“I’m fond of you, Nicholas,”
she said once. She called him
Nicholas, now. “I must be a
mother at heart, after all.”
He told her how he’d bought
her from Alfredo, bought her
for two tickets to Brisbane. He
wanted her to be interested in
him.
“He’d have taken less,” she
said. “A ferry-ride to Mosman.
You should have beaten him
down.”
He changed jobs ; became a
clerk, regular as Marion’s
parties. Pay-fortnights he’d
bring her a surprise—peaches
to soak in brandy, a mechanical
train that they played with and
laughed about, some French
dance-records that they moved
to. She accepted him and
everything without fuss.
He bought her a dress that
he chose himself. He was
proud of it. “Aren’t you
pleased?” he kept saying.
“Aren’t you pleased that I
thought of you?”
“You are a baby,” she said.
“Come here.”
“1 think of you all the time.”
“Don’t talk,” she said.
“Why don’t we get
married?”
“What for?” said Sally.
'THEY heard that Alfredo
was back; had left Pin-
head and a baby in Brisbane;
was living in a cave or a posh
weekender at Palm Beach with
a society blonde.
“A blonde,” said Sally.
“Some cry-baby blonde.”
“Come to bed,” said
Nicholas.
“I don’t want to.” She wan-
dered half-naked round the
room. She lifted clothes and
cushions up with her foot, very
carefully. Suddenly she lifted
the table on one hand, high
above her head. “I’m strong,”
she said. “1 could beat you.”
When she came to bed she said
no.
The next pay-night Nicholas
brought his surprise wrapped in
fancy paper.
“Open it,” he said.
“Yes, baby,” said Sally. Her


Hibbs would say something
like: “It’s nice to meet you at
last, Mr. Ruhen. We like your
stories very much.”
Olaf would grunt, eloquently,
implying by a mere nasal-lung
noise that the “Saturday Even-
ing Post” would be half-witted
if it didn’t like his stories. At
the same time, he’d be wonder-
ing what the hell they found
to like about them.
There’d then be some ex-
change of small-talk probably
about the weather, which in
Philadelphia, where the “Satur-
day Evening Post” lives, is
sometimes superb, but generally
vile.
“Well, sir,” Hibbs would ask,
affably, “is there anybody else
right here you’d like to meet?”
At that stage Olaf would lean
forward with the Lutheran
look in his eye. He’d have
remembered that Hibbs, despite
his charm, was an editor.
In quiet but sinister tones,
he’d say: “Yes. I’d like a word
with the man who subbed that
story I sold you in 1952. He
altered a dash into a semicolon
on the second page of the copy
—that was the third paragraph
of the fourth column in the
magazine. Where I said, on
page nine of the manuscript,
‘l’ll clock you, you cow,’ this
animal altered it to, ‘l’ll clobber
you, Mac.’ That’s the cove I’m
dying to meet around here.”
Some little time after that
the mighty Gurtis Publishing
Company building would
probably rock a little on its
foundations.
That evening it would be
noticed that various editors and
other executives, leaving to go
home, looked pale and shaken.
Next day armed guards
would probably be posted in
the entrance hall, and all
editors and subs in the
country would take out addi-
tionai life-assurance.
To)UHEN is not, of course,
different from other
writers in disliking being
“subbed.” He’s just tougher
about it, less inclined to admit
that after much labor and
thought he has still used too
many words, or chosen the
wrong ones to tell his story.
He’s a perfectionist who
spares no effort to get every
syllable as right as possible,
and he refuses to acknowledge
that any clerk-like gentlemen at
subs -tables know better about
~, , .
He s right, too ; but his
attitude is too exhausting tor
most people. After a first fine
flush of rage it all seems less
and less important as the hours,
or even the minutes, pass.
Particularly on daily news-
papers, one is likely to reflect
that the life of the whole thing
is just a day, so why worry
about it tomorrow?
Olaf is one of the few m
whose mind that thought is
followed immediately and
automatically by the idea that
they’ll muck him up tomorrow,
too-and for an endless succes-
sion of tomorrows unless he
fights back as hard as he can.
best stories have
all appeared originally in
The Bulletin, in which
subbing is both cautious and
highly intelligent, • and into
which actual ideas are admitted
from time to time.
His “Saturday Evening Post”
stuff, though above the average
in that publication, is patterned
for its particular market, and
pretty much confined to New
Guinea and similar back-
grounds which, fortunately for
each of them, both Olaf and
Mr. Hibbs thought interesting,.
His stuff about Australia
and his native New Zealand,
the fishermen, the natives, and
the vigor of life in the places
he knows most intimately and
loves best, are not to the
American taste, in the judg-
ment of the American editors.
Which is, no doubt, a reason
why he’ll probably be even
more hostile to editors in the
United States than he was to
most of the breed in Australia.
How they’ll deal with him,
goodness only knows, but, as I
said, there is a mighty multitude
of them. They’re a powerful
race of men, too, used to con-
tributors who touch their fore-
locks as soon as one of them
appears, leer ingratiatingly, and
never contradict. Our Mr.
Ruhen would rather tear his
forelock out by the roots than
touch it to anybody, his .leer is
either genuinely friendly or
threatening, and he contradicts
everybody about everything.
If he ever manages to get
back, he’ll have some fine old
tales to tell. And if he’s found
at the bottom of some North
American river with his feet
set firm in a bucket of con-
crete it will certainly be news.
It would be the first time in
history that editors had con-
spired together to commit a
crime of violence, and it should
rate the biggest headlines ever.
voice hid no contempt.
“Sardines?”
It was a ham-knife —long,
thin-bladed, sharp.
“For you,” he said. “If
you’re naughty.” he laughed.
“You are funny, Nicholas,”
said Sally. “You are funny.”
They went to Marion’s. Sally
insisted. She wanted to go out.
The usual crowd was there, the
usual games; Alfredo didn’t
turn up.
“You broke his heart, Sally,”
said Marion. “He still talks of
you. But he seems to be
devoted to Vera, so I suppose
that’s all right.”
Nicholas followed Marion
into the kitchen to question her
about Alfredo.
“Oh, darling,” she breathed
at him. She had been drinking
rum. “It’s no good making a
pass at me. Think of Sally.”
Nicholas began to mumble
in his old way.
“It’s not that I’m not fond
of you,” she said. “It’s just
that I like Sally so much.”
‘look, darling,” she said in
her managing-men tone. “Let
me go now. 1 have to serve the
beasts. Ask me again after
Sally leaves you.”
“She wouldn’t do that.”
“Oh, I’m sure she’s fond of
you, very fond of you in a way.
But Alfredo will make her.
He’s a forceful brute, roars like
a bull. Quite an animal, and
Sally”
“I’d kill her.”
“Nicholas, dear! This is the
twentieth-century art, life,
freedom, votes for women, and
so on. See you later,” she
said.
“I've got a knife,” he called
after her.
Peter the Painter heard him.
“Done your good deed for the
day?” he said.
came home from
‘ work one day and found
Sally gone. There was a note:
See you, baby. * Thanks.
Sally.
That was all. It was enough.
“Good-luck for me,” he said.
“I’ll leave work tomorrow.”
He started going to Marion’s
regularly. A fresher attached
herself to him; she was
emancipating herself. “I'm
tired of being a child,” she
said.
Sally was there sometimes,
with Alfredo. “Hi,” she said.
Nicholas avoided talking with
either of them.
He spent his nights with the
student. He didn’t talk to her
much but she rattled on —life,
freedom, what are we for —the
way he used to talk. She

moved in with him and gave up
her uni.-course, Everyone
treated them as settled. He got
a job in the public service.
He went to see Sally. She
was living with Alfredo at the
’Loo. “I call it Potts Point,”
he had heard Alfredo saying.
“The rent’s fantastic but the
room’s big and there’s plenty of
light. You can paint all day.
Sally’s working, of course.
Brisbane has altered my whole
approach. Nobody’s white
there. It’s just like Tahiti”
And so on.
Sally was in. She was lying
around. There were clothes on
the floor, not only hers. There
was a nude of her on an easel.
“Why don’t you come back
to me?” he said.
“I’m all right,” said Sally.
“We’d get married.”
Sally laughed.
“I’ll kill you if you don’t.”
He had hidden the knife in the
arm of his coat. He pulled it
out.
“Don’t be a baby,” said
Sally.
“No,” he said sadly. “I won’t.
Did you think I had a stiff
arm?” She just looked at him.
He walked over to the easel.
“Are you coming back with
me?”
“Be nice, Nicholas,” she
said.
He slashed at the canvas with
the knife. The blade went
through but he couldn’t rip at
it. The canvas was tough. He
had to make tearing tugs all the
time. “Look,” he said. “Look
at this —you! ”
“He’ll have to do it again,”
she said. “I sat for hours.”
He lunged at her with the
knife and she tried to dodge.
It’s very hard to pierce the
breast-bone, and he thought he
hadn’t hurt her. They stood
looking at one another. She
pulled her dressing-gown open.
There was some blood. He
felt sick.
“It’s only a scratch,” she
said. “It shouldn’t scar. Now
go away, Nick.”
“All right,” he said.
He went. She had called -him
Nick.
A FEW months later he was
promoted at the office. He
spent the raise marrying his
fresher. They had a church-
wedding. Peter the Painter
gave away the bride; her
family wouldn’t come. Marion
was matron-of-honor.
“Won’t Sally be furious?”
she said. “Missing all this
champagne! ”

instances this difficulty. Its last verse
goes:—-
In a gully green, where a dam lies
gleaming,
And the bush creeps back on a
worked-out claim,
And the sleepy crows in the sun sit
dreaming
On the timbers grey and a charred
hut frame,
Where the legs slant down and the
hare is squatting
In the high, rank grass by the
dried-up course,
Nigh a shattered drum and a king-
post rotting
Are the bleaching bones of the
old grey horse.
That is so nearly lyric poetry—
Dyson’s ballad so often almost stops
being a ballad —that I find myself
thinking: is this a gain or a loss to our
literature? But “Wallaby Joe,” another
faithful equine skeleton —the bones of
a strayed stockhorse found by his
owner, years after his loss, wedged in
a gully—poses no such problems and
arouses much the same emotions: —
Now as years flew by, and Bill
grew old,
It came into his head to go looking
for gold,
So off he went, with his pick and
his spade,
For digging, says he, shall now be
my trade.
It chanced as a gully he happened
to cross,
He Came on the bones of his poor
old horse ;
The hobbles were jammed in a root
below,
Which occasioned the death of old
Wallaby Joe.
Oh! poor Wallaby Joe,
Old Wallaby Joe of Bellagaroo.
The origins of the Australian bush
song were obviously varied. There is
the convict verse, some of which was,
even if written in Australia, printed
and sung, too, overseas.
‘ Then, from the number of songs
which directly derive from British
originals (variants of such old favorites
as “The Banks of the Nile,” “The
Tarpaulin Jacket,” “The Fine Old
English Gentleman” and, later, from
various popular songs of the later
nineteenth century “Ben Bolt,”
“Sweet Belle Mahone”) it is apparent
that alert parodists were at work.
Other songs were composed expressly
for the amusement of the writer’s
fellow-workers. Such an author was
A. W. Davis, who wrote “The Drovers’
Cook” —“on my first trip from Forest
Vale in 1892,” and who also, on the
authority of R. C. Lethbridge, the
brother of Davis’s late employer,
wrote “The Maranoa Drovers.”
We discovered one apparently
definite instance of how a literary
ballad of inferior quality became trans-
muted into the stronger metal of a
bush song: “The Shanties by the Way,”
altered and improved from an
original version by a certain E. J.
Overbury, whose poems were pub-
lished in Creswick, Victoria, in 1865.
The opposite process also occurred.
We have found several fascinating
examples of direct borrowing from
bush songs. A most obvious instance
was Louis Esson’s well-known “Black
Fish: A Swaggie’s Song,” first
published in “The Bulletin” in 1916.
Comparing Esson’s verse with the
older, anonymous “Shearers’ Song”
with its chorus:—
With me four little johnny-cakes
All nicely cooked,
A nice little codfish
Fresh from the ’ook,
Little round flour-bag
Sittin’ on a stump,
Little tea and sugar-bag
Lookin’ nice and plump . . .
there can be no doubt of Esson’s
direct debt, or of the superior qualities
both of atmosphere and interest of the
original.
The question of which songs should
be included in the anthology (it is to
be published this month by Angus and
Robertson) was closely linked to the
origin and classification of the songs
themselves. A shearer’s ditty such as
“Goorianawa” posed no problems. It
is an authentic bush song which
Paterson, who said his examples were
“Composed and Sung in the Bushrang-
ing, Digging and Overlanding Days,”
would no doubt have used if he had
known of it.
But can one fairly describe “The
Daly River Oh” as an old bush song
by this definition? We felt that we
could—present-day songs from the
Northern Territory and the remoter
parts of Queensland and the other
States being, even if of recent composi-
tion. still the product of a genuine
pioneering background.
Then there were a number of songs,
especially from the goldfields, which
were composed and sung by such
itinerant strays from the music-halls as
Thatcher, Coxon and Small. Paterson
must surely have known of Thatcher’s
books, but he did not include any of
his songs—should we? We decided to
do so for the following reasons: firstly,
Paterson had used such works as
“Billy Barlow” or “Paddy Malone in
Australia.” which had comparable
origins; secondly, in recent collections,
often taken at first-hand from elderly
people who still delight to sing many
of the old rhymes, the Thatcher songs,
frequently half-forgotten or imperfectly
memorised, crop up again and again;
and a third reason was that it has
been categorically stated that goldfields
balladry did not exist.
Another problem that faced us was
to decide what to do with a fairly
extensive body of convict verse and
broadside material. Some of these
songs are still sung; one in particular
—“The Convict’s Lament Over Captain
Logan”—sounds exquisitely dreary set
to an ancient dirgelike tune and is
reported to have great currency at a
certain stage of sprees in Queensland.
We found fragments by convicts
which fitted fairly comfortably into a
bush-song collection. Others seemed
to have virtues more in their quaint
interest than because they really
belonged here. We decided, however,
that readers might be as fascinated
as we had been to find rhymed
requests for new boots, or for the
remorseful condemned-cell repentances
of John Weachurch, first published in

MARRIAGE AND THE FAMILY IN AUSTRALIA
edited by Professor A. P. Elkin, the eminent anthropologist. Chapters discuss:
a statistical picture of family structure and stress; studies of the family and
marriage in relation to Australian class structure; changing social and person-
ality-building function of the family; causes of strain and failure in marriage as
they have become apparent to the Marriage Guidance Council of N.b.W. and
the deprivation suffered by children in unsatisfactory homes.
In a final summing-up Professor Elkin gives a general description of the
present position of marriage and the family in Australia, emphasising the trends
at change. 27 / 6 <P ost 7d >

Such broadsides as we included are
a small sample of the many to be
found, and we were guided by their
interest in “setting the scene” for the
works to follow and, too, by the fact
that many of them are true songs.
While Paterson’s collection is still
the nucleus of this book, much more
new material than was contemplated
has been added —a great deal collected
by Russel Ward and by John Meredith,
Peter Hellier and other members of
the Australian Folklore Society, who
have interviewed old-timers and made
tape-recordings of their songs.
The tape-recorder, indeed, promises
to alter and simplify future methods
of collection of folklore. It seems to
me that in Australia at present our
folksong has arrived at a curiously
paradoxical stage. With the passing
of the genuine “pioneering atmos-
phere,” with improved communica-
tions and, above all, with the advent
of the film and radio, folk-singing and
folk-tradition ceased.
But overseas in recent years those
very media of film and radio which
formerly made the newest popular
song-hit a substitute for this tradition
of home-spun balladry are rediscover-
ing and re-presenting such material,
both directly and by using it as a
basis for popular “hit tunes.” During
the depression of the ’thirties in
America the folk-material of that
country was exhaustively collected
under “writers’ projects.”
Here we are coming to realise much
later what treasure we have nearly
lost. Many of the people who can
still recall our songs are very old—
they find it difficult to write down
words, and unless someone expert can
transcribe the music it must vanish.
Use of a tape-recorder preserves not
only words and music but also
preserves, in a most fascinating way,
nuances of inflection, comments made
by the singers and even transmits a
great deal of their own pleasure in
singing. However, collecting and
printing the music is a separate field:
it was the words of the songs, for
their literary and historical interest, we
gathered for this anthology.
A revival of interest in Australian
folklore has already been remarked:
these songs and stories are being
recognised as one of the true and
traditional constituents of a genuine
Australian mythology.

Now Seek My Bones: S. H. Courtier
(Hammond and Hammond). Seems
like this Rann McGorrie has been
killed by a crocodile on his island off
Port Crosby—you go by air from
Brisbane—but Jeffrey Galloway gets a
telegram on his way there that confirms
his suspicions of murder. He finds the
beautiful dark-haired daughter, the
seemingly easily - kissable medical
blonde, the old aunt, the old snake-
tamer, etc. Then there is news of a
black cult of men who wear crocodile-
heads; and later of buried treasure . . .
if most of it is a bit too much, at
least the scenes with the snake-tamer
and the scene where the man and the
girl go out in the garden to shoot at
three hundred escaped snakes are
worth while.

. over ok y° : P- Marquand
(Collins). After twenty years of taking
upper - class American businessmen
seriously, Mr. Marquand has returned
to thrillers and his famous Mr. Moto.
An American secret-service man has
gone to Japan to investigate an
organisation of “do-gooders” m„ from
America which is suspected of efforts
to Communise the Japanese. He is
accompanied by a beautiful secret-
service girl and is dogged by plotters,
death and the mysterious Mr. Moto. It
is very well written. and the ending
is sad which, in thriller-writing argues
a weakness in the author. A thriller-
author should always extricate his
leads from the difficulties into which
he ensnares them: otherwise he should
be court-martialled and his licence
revoked.

Papa’s Wife: Thyra Ferre Bjorn
(Hutchinson). Papa was a parson in
Lapland and Mamma had been the
maidservant in his house. Although
she determined to marry him the
moment she heard him preaching it
took her many years to get him to the
altar, and even then he said “No”
instead of “I do.” However, the
marriage turned out very well indeed,
and the author, one of the eight
children bom to it, tells its story with
humor and charm, though senti-
mentalising at times,

Wasted lives. Year after year our bad roads are contributing to accident after accident.
Scores of Australians are being killed or permanently injured. To cope with the ever-
increasing flow of modern fast-moving traffic, today’s roads must be straight and wide
so that both pedestrian and motorist can enjoy greater safety.

Wasted time. Bad roads cause costly delays. Frustrating
delays in congested traffic, at rail crossings, on long slow
hauls up steep narrow inclines . . . these and many other
faults in our road system help push up the prices of
goods and services which are ultimately passed on to
you forcing up your cost of living.
YOU ARE PAYING millions of pounds a year for
Australia’s thousands of miles of crumbling, out-moded
roads and congested city streets. Lives are lost every
day through unsafe rail crossings, narrow bridges,
dangerous crests and other hazards. Don’t you agree
it’s time we did something about it?
Australia has the engineers, the manpower, the
ingenuity and all the means to build good roads. Now
we need a blueprint for further action.
An Australian National Roads Authority, a single
body backed by the necessary powers and funds, could
be the first step in bringing bur roads into line with
today’s . . V tomorrow’s requirements. Such an
Higher food bills. 76% of all freight is carried by road
of which food is a major item. It is estimated that the
cost of freight is 6/- in every pound you spend on con-
sumer goods. Good roads would substantially reduce this
freight cost even by half.
Authority could co-ordinate the plans of existing state
and shire road-making bodies who are doing their
best under great difficulties to keep our roads open —-
so that our road construction programme keeps pace
