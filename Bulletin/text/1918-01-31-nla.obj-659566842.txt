Socialistic Verses
The Red Page
THE LAND SALE.
Behold, upon the wind-swept ways they rear
The tattered ensign of the hosts of greed,
Who batten on their brothers’ homing need.
Across the moorland echoes far and near
The jargon of the loud-tongued auctioneer,
Bewildering the birds that build and breed
Upon their Makers moor sans title-deed.
Ye timorous things! what is it that ye fear?
What though men sell this flower-filled land,
arid mar
Thy heather ed havens with unverdured
street,
And hide the gracious grass with sand and
tar
To pave a way for rent-collecting feet, *
Be comforted, ye freedom-nurtured things,
For God hath other moors, and ye have
wings.
RAIL AND ROAD.
Adventurous weeds upon the railroad stray
Among the sleepers, vagrants that reveal
How swiftly Nature such a hurt could heal,
Clothing again with bough, and bud, and
spray.
And fragrant flower, this hard metallic way,
Where thrust of crank and mad revolt of
wheel
Thrush out the wanderlust of steam and
steel-
Tivir ties that rule our world to-day.
Give nr a road that winds among the hills,
Some mountain myrtles in a cloudy slcy:
And be not niggardly with wayside rills,
And cool retreats for all things moist and
shy:
And let me hear the lyre-bird’s luscious
notes
Thieving the bullads from his neighbors’
throats.
ROOMS TO-LET FOR SINGLE MEN.
Kerb and pavement, street and wall,
And this hangs staring out at all.
O Woman ipith unrounded breast,
Poor little dream-child uncaressed.
O callous City, bending cruel,
With brutal breath, o’er phoenix fuel.
O smouldering rooms, blaze up, and then
Build on those ashes homes for men!
A WEALTH CENSUS CARD.
My meed, of Beauty—
'Though 1 but glean
Tardily, here and there ,
Just a faint gleam,
Only a chord or two,
i\ ! ot the full theme.
My meed of Poesy —
Though I belong
Not to the highways
That aspirants throng,
But stumble at times
On a sheep-walk of song.
My meed of Faith —
That ( when Self is laid bare,
Showing the evil
And good that is there),
In spite of the strife
Beckons Hope, not Despair.
My meed of Patience ■ —■
As daily I plod
Over the plough-lands
So many have trod;
My feet in the furrow,
My face towards God.
From “-Verses,”
by R. H. Long.
Happily, It. H. Long, whose Verses are
published by Stone, Adelaide, does not
always harness his Pegasus to his socialistic
cart: sometimes he allows the nag to graze
by the roadside. For the moke runs stiffly
between the socialistic shafts. There is a
sonnet to Adela Pankhurst, in which the
poet asks
What theme more fit for story or for song
Than fearless youth oppressing ancient
wrong ....?
But when he asks the world to twine laureate
wreaths around Adela’s brow, “wreaths for
the maid of Peace, this seer of ours,” the
sentiment may be all right, but the poetry
isn’t. And when he remarks: “I cannot see
how goodwill will arise by bashing out
brains'or by gouging out eyes,” this is sheer
polemics and sordid prose. And though we
agree with the author’s sentiment in refusing
to believe’ that “when Christ preached his
sermons he made reservations excluding the'
Germans”—though we are open to argue
that if there had been any Germans in those
days Christ would have felt inclined to
qualify his remarks—-yet the argument is
shallow and the manner of it uninspired.
But when R. H. Long forgets his politics
and gives his Pegasus its rein, when he
treads “the quiet country roads of God,” he
finds such treasures as. “The Skylark’s
Nest”: —
Here Nature holds as in a holloiced hand
For keen and loving eyes alone to see,
The larks and lyrics that are yet to he....
and learns that 1
From simplest nest may soar the sweetest
song ....
or sees
The flying-foxes swoop from tree to tree,
The ’possums scamper up the messmate’s
hark
In shadowy spirals, and. the wallaby
Goes thumping down the gully in the
dark. ..„
or finds the Acheron Valley
Gleaning the quiet afterglow of day.
There is genuine poetry here, the product of
a self-contained and original mind.
Fiction
William ,T. Locke can always be depended
upon. The'lied Planet (Lane, pec George
Robertson, Melb.) is, of'course, a war story,
but, wisely, the scene is not set on the
battlefield. “Thus over the sequestered vale,
far away from the sound of the shells, even
off the track 'of marauding Zeppelins, rode
the fiery planet Mars. There is not a
homestead in Great Britain that in one
form or another has not caught a reflection
of its blood-red ray. No matter how we may
seek distraction in work or amusement, the
angry glow is ever before our eyes, coloring
our vision, coloring our thoughts, coloring
our emotions for good or for ill. We cannot
escape it. Our personal destinies are inex-
tricably interwoven with • the fate directing
the death grapple of the thousand miles of
battle-line, and arbitrating on the doom of
colossal ships.”
It is a charming story, with heaps of plot.
The old Boer-war warrior, a cripple, who
tells the story, offers enough puzzles lor the
reader. “I felt myself being drawn into a
fog-filled labyrinth of intrigue in which
already groping were most of the people I
knew. What with the mysterious relations
between Betty and Boyce and between Boyce
and Gedge, what with young I lucre’s full
exoneration of Boyce, what with .young Ran-
dall’s split with Gedge and his impeccable
attitude towards Phyllis, things were com-
plicated enough; Sir Anthony’s revelations
regarding poor Althea and his dark surmises
concerning Randall complicated them still
more; arid now comes Airs. Holmes .to tell
me of Randall’s mysterldiis disappearance.”
B.ut it is more than a detective story ; it
is an incisive study of Fear—-the sort of
Fear that practically for the first time we
have heard of in this war, the Fear that
attacks even the bravest man, and by a tem-
porary paralysis of his brain leads either to
disgrace or. possibly, to the Y.C. And the
whole Story is so delightfully English, so
gentlemanly in attitude, so pleasantly suave !
Locke knows the public taste: it is to his
credit that he always gives the beast a little
better food than it needs.
When a novel opens gaily with a seasick
bishop, and when that bishop is the Bishop
of Bampopo, and when we learn that he is
bound for the Mediterranean island Nepen-
the, “famous for its girls and its. lobsters,
but also for its sirocco,” and we note the
genial wit of Norman Douglas, we feel that
South Wind (Seeker, per Dy mock’s
Library ) is going to do us as much good as
it is going to do the Bishop of Bampopo.
And it does. Indeed, Nepenthe is a delight-
ful Everybody goes there, and
everything happens there; but somehow
nothing seems to matter.. . .perhaps it is due
to the lobsters, or, maybe, the south wind,
which seems to have a steadily disintegrat-
ing influence upon the Bishop’s morals. You
see, he had just come from the Equatorial
Regions of Africa, and .lie was a little run-
down.
Nepenthe seems to be populated chiefly by
gossipers and scoundrels; both are charm-
ing. It is. an amazingly varied assortment
of characters to which Norman Douglas in-
troduces the Bishop. And life is so sunnily
pleasant on Nepenthe! Listen to the
Nepenthean philosophy; “We have only a
certain amount of energy at our disposal.
It i*fe not seemly to consume every ounce of
it in a contest with brute nature. Man is
made for better things. .. .Consider the- com-
plex conditions under which a Northern
European family is obliged to live. Think
of the labor expended upon that unnecessary
duel with the elements—the extra clothing
and footwear and mufflers and mantles, the
carpets, the rugs, the abundant and costly
food required to keep the body in sound
working condition, the plumbing, the gas,
the woodwork, the paintings and repaint-
ings,. the tons of fuel, the lighting in winter,
the contrivances against frost and rain, the
daily polishings and scrubbings, and those
thousand other impediments to the life of
the spirit! Half of these are non-existent
in these latitudes ; half the vitality expended
on them could therefore be directed to other
ends. At close of day, your Northerner is
pleased with himself. He has survived ; he
has even prospered. His family is adequately
housed and clothed. He feels, presen table, as
he calls it, in the eyes of those who share
his illusions What has he done? He
has performed certain social and political
duties—he knows nothing of duties to him-
self. . . .It is not enough for us. Living in
our lands, men would have leisure to culti-
vate nobler aspects of their nature. They
would be accessible to purer aspirations,
worthier delights.... In the Mediterranean
lies the hope of humanity.” Perhaps we
should restrict that sweeping assertion to
the island of Nepenthe.
In this delightful island once lived the
Good Duke Alfred. He built a mountain
stronghold—a symphony in emerald and
coral, since lie insisted mat every building in
it should be painted a uniform pink. He
also fixed by law the number of inhabitants,
thus solving for all time the congestion pro-
blem. 11 is method was simple: the town
must contain 500 souls, neither more nor
less. “If in any year the population ex-
ceeded that figure, the surplus was taken
away, from among the adult males, to work
as galley-slaves in his fleet; a deficiency in
the requisite number was met by giving new
husbands from the lower town, often three
or four at a time, ‘with a view to ensuring
good results,’ to those of the native women
who had hitherto failed to produce offspring.
The system worked well.” A historian
recorded that “never have the generative
capacities of mankind shaped themselves
with more success to the shape of an un-
necessary wall.”
In this charming vein of cynicism Norman
Douglas describes the evolution of a
Russian saint who. after triumphs and
vicissitudes that shame those of Rasputin,
came at last with his band of converts to
the haven of Nepenthe; and with a touch of
Anatole France he dilates upon the many
fountains of Nepenthe. Indeed his descrip-
tion of the various fountains makes an ideal
guide-book. “The Fountain known as ‘La
Salina’ of arsenical nature, was frequented
chiefly by women who found in its waters
an alleviation for troubles which Monsignor
Perellf does not specify. It was recom-
mended, moreover, as a sheep-dip. . . .The
Fountain of Saint Feto had, by virtue of its
smell alone, applied to her nose as she lay
in her coffin, raised from the dead a certain
Anna da Pasto. . .. The Fountain of . Saint
Elias, sulphurous and saponaceous, was re-
nowned for its calming influence upon all
who suffered from abuse of lechery or
alcohol, or from ingrowing toenails.”
The good old Duke was an ideal despot.
His taxation methods were a marvel of sim-
plicity. Each citizen paid what he liked.
If the sum proved insufficient he was
apprised of the fact next morning by having
his left hand amputated. In a period when
all Europe was convulsed in savage warfare
he remained immune. He conciliated his
more powerful neighbors by timely gifts of
local delicacies—the Nepenthe lobsters and
the Nepenthe girls, “both items of the finest
quality imaginable.” Even minor sovereigns
he supplied with periodical consignments of
pretty maidens and well-flavored crayfish,
only of somewhat inferior quality—the crus-
taceans often too young, and the damsels
occasionally over-ripe. His habit of cub-
ting off portions of the features of his sub-
jects gave rise to one of his blithest watch-
words : “Nose after ears!”
Exquisite fooling, this, delivered with a
mock-gravity that heightens the dry humor.
Rut Norman Douglas does not lose himself
i'n his quips. He provides a breathless plot
and a host of curious character studies. At
Nepenthe there is good , company for the
fastidious reader. The dear bishop is
affected by the prevailing south wind-—and
the ' prevailing morals. He found himself
condoning what elsewhere he would have
termed vice—but then he had just come from
Rampopo. He had to puli himself up.
“The whole question is plain as a pikestaff.
Am I becoming more of a Christian, or
less,?” In that fortnight on Nepenthe—a
fortnight including a murder, several scan-
dals, a miracle or two, a volcanic eruption
and a continuous torrent of conversation —
the Bishop wilted.
“A kind of merry nightmare. Things hap-
pened. . There was something bright and
diabolical in the tone of the place, something-
kaleidoscopic—a frolicsome perversity. Puri-
fying, at the same time. It swept away the
cobwebs. It gave you a measure, a stan-
dard, whereby to compute earthly affairs.
....His values had righted themselves. He
had carved out new and sound ones; a work-
able, up-to-date theory of life. He was in
fine trim. His liver -he forgot that he eyer
had one. Nepenthe had done him good all
round. And lie knew exactly what he
wanted.... And how would England com-
pare with the tingling realism of Nepenthe?
Rather parochial, rather dun. Everything
fireproof, seaworthy. Kindly thoughts ex-
pressed in safe, unvarying formulas....
Ships tossing at sea; minds firmly anchored
to the commonplace. Abundance for the
body; diet for tlie spirit. Horror of the
tangent, the extreme, the unconventional.
God save the King.”
And, characteristically, we take leave of
the Bishop when he is on his way home
from the tavern, and he notices that the
moon is behaving queerly, almost as if it
were drunk. And sometimes there were two
moons. ...
Perhaps you have to get into the
Nepenthe mood before you enjoy South
Wind. The serious reader would never dis-
cover the - way to Nepenthe—or if he did, he
would never realise that he was there. But
once you relapse into the Norman Douglas
mood, you will enjoy yourself as much as the
dear Bishop did.
Gone to Earth, by Mary Webb (Con-
stable), is another Gloom Novel. It is set
in one of those gloomy counties of gloomy
England, a fox-hunting county peopled by
dour religionists, stolid peasants and dull
fox-hunters. Miss Ciombers rode “with so
grim a mouth and such a bloodthirsty ex-
pression that she might have had a blood-
feud with all foxes. Perhaps, when she rode
down the anxious red-brown streak, she
thought she was riding down a cruel fate
that had somehow left her life vacant of
joy; perhaps,' when the little creature was
torn piecemeal, she imagined herself tearing
so the frail unconquerable powers of love
and beauty. Anyway, she never missed a
meet, and she and her sister never ceased
their long silent battle for Reddin, who re-
mained as unconscious of them as if they
were his aunts.”
Hazel, the ignorant daughter of a bee-
keeper, coffin-maker and harp-player, is, how-
ever. a niece of lush and pulsating life,
doomed, in that environment, to come to
grief. She is wanted by two dramatically-
contrasted men, Edward, the young neutral-
tinted minister, and Reddin, the crude horse-
breeder. Edward gets her,- simply because
Hazel told her father that she would marry
the- first who asked her. When Edward
proposes she asks, “Will you buy me a green
gown with yellow roses onV’’ and “Will you
gi’ me pear-drops every day V” But Edward
fatuously errs in making this vivid, wonder-
ful thing his wife only in name—a mistake
which husbands make more frequently in
novels than they do in real life. Still,
Edward was that sort of chap. Of course,
Reddin gets her —by methods simple and
direct, The reader cannot feel much sym-
pathy for Edward—Reddin was -obviously
the mate for this beautiful wild thing. After
the catastrophe Reddin and Hazel “regarded
each one another mistrustfully, like two
creatures taken in a snare. They both felt
as if they had been trapped by something
vast and intangible.... Reddin had imposed
a deeper change on her than the change from
maid to wife. He had robbed her of a thing
frailer and rarer than maidenhood —the sac-
ramental love of Nature. It is only the fair-
est, the highest and fullest matings that do
not rob the soul of this, even when it is an
old, tried joy. lie had wronged her as deeply
as one human being can wrong another. Ilis
theft was cruel as that of one who destroys
a man's God. And. the strange part of it
was that never, as long as he lived, would
he know that he had done so, or even guess
that there had been any treasury to rifle.
He would probably, as an old man, long past
desire, repent of the physical part of the
affair. Yet this was so much the lesser of
the two. Indeed, if he had been able to win
her. love, it would have been, not wrong-
doing, but righteousness. That a woman
should, in the evolution of life, cease to be
a virgin and become a mother is a thing so
natural and so purely physical as hardly
to need comment; but that the immortal
part of her should be robbed, that she should
cease to be an entity in a world where per-
sonality is the only rare and precious thing
—this is tragic.” i
Still, as the- author says, though Reddin
could not help his over-virility, it did seem
a pity that “after so many centuries, so
many matings and births', all his emblazoned
and crested ancestors should have produced
merely—Reddin, a person exactly like them-
selves.”
So each of these men attract one side of
this beautiful girl; and all she wanted was
herself. The final tragedy is in keeping with
the sustained sombre beauty of the tale, and
yet, though hinted at in the first chapter, it
comes as a shock to even the hardened
reader of Gloom Fiction. Mary Webb can
write.
Much is Life, by Tom Collins (Joseph
Furpliy), was published 14 years ago by
The Bulletin. A second edition, accord-
ing to Vance Palmer, is. now called for by
“weight of critical opinion rather than the
importunity of the booksellers.” Hence this
new edition, published bv The Specialty
Press, Melb. Vance Palmer, in a weighty
preface, claims that this work, apart from
its intrinsic literary quality, registers a
faithful picture of life in the Riverina a
generation ago. The author, born at Yering
in 1843, was a fitting chronicler for that
period; and Such is Life is essentially Aus-
tralian in outlook and atmosphere. “The
value of Such is Life lies in' the extraordi-
nary richness of its philosophy and charac-
terisation, in the vitality of its style, and in
the whimsical humor with which it is
saturated.” And Vance Palmer claims that
■ this work will become a classic for the next
generation.
Such is Life is the sort of book an Aus-
tralian should keep on his handiest shelf, to
dip into. Occasionally he’ll draw a blank;
but usually he’ll find something well worth
thinking over. A multifarious and stimulat-
ing mind, that of Tom Collins! Vance
Palmer might consider the question of a
concentrated extract of Tom Collins of the
essence of At dralianism in literary tabloid
form. Sacrilege, no doubt, to Vance
Palmer. but a been to the tired Australian.
The tenth part of Muirhead Bone’s note-
worthy drawings of The Western Front
( Country Life, London, 2s.) deals with
ship-building; without which there could
be for England no Western Front. It is a
remarkable series of pictures, conveying an
overwhelming impression of the vigur and
the magnitude of Englands desperate race
against the U-boat. The standard ships are
shown in every stage of their construction;
and the drawings are brilliantly done.

HOPPING at Anthony Horderns’ Sale will
prove a profitable investment to all who
are wise enough to purchase their future
requirements during the currency of
Anthony Horderns’ Famous Sale Prices.
Prices of almost every commodity are still rising
many lines in daily demand are almost unprocurable’
cottons and woollens are becoming extremely scarce!
and there seems no likelihood of relief from the
position of higher costs and restricted supplies.
The pages of the Sale Catalogue enumerate many
thousands of lines that have been genuinely reduced
in price; in many cases to below to-day’s costs in
London. It will be noted that the quantities avail-
able are set out, therefore the wisdom of early buying
is apparent. Write for a copy, posted free on request.

Self-Poisoning
IT is easy to get constipated. It is easy to let
yourself stay constipated. It may seem a matter
of little consequence to you.
Yet any doctor will tell you that the poisoning of
the system by the products of constipation is one of
the most dangerous conditions to which mankind
is subjected.
Dull headaches, listlessness, sallow complexion,
intestinal troubles —all of these are signs of self*
poisoning, which weakens the system and exposes
you to the inroads of disease.
You can prevent and relieve constipation by the
use of Nujol, the natural laxative which is now
recommended by leading physicians the world
over as the safe and sure treatment for constipation.
Nujol is not absorbed by the system but acts as
an internal lubricant.

VARIOUS VERSE
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
An Old Love Story.
[When Shah Jehan was deposed his treatment was
kinder than that meted out to most Oriental despots
who throw the dice with Fate and lose. The victors
did not put out his eyes. Instead he was permitted
to sit on the balcony of his prison at Agra and regale
those mournful eyes with the vision of the Taj
Mahal, that truly Imperial tomb which he built for
Arjumand Banu, the wife of his youth.]
By the Jumna’s tide is 'the marble flower
That Jehan fashioned from love and tears
When Arjumand died in the Jasmine Tower
And joy lay slain for all after-years.
In the time-worn tower on the city wall
Her face like a star at the casement shone
When she heard the sound of his footstep
fall—
O Allah ! Allah ! The joys that have gone!
If the mouldering walls took voice and told
Of the passioned things in that dark room,
Of her flower-like breasts, as pale as gold.
Her dark eyes flaming through incense
gloom,
Of tense brown faces and scarlet lips,
The mating glory of life at its noon —
O Allah! Whatever the years eclipse,
This love outlasteth both sun and moon !
Now the lizard may bask on her window-sill.
And the night-bird hoot where the lady
laughed—
What does it matter? They had their fill,
And of life’s good measure they drained
their draught!
The silken couch where they laid their heads.
And drowsed to sleep in the Indian night.
May be dust of the desert or shameful shreds.
But their soul-fires flame in the years’
despite.
When Arjumand, called from the Jasmine
Tower,
Like a leaf went down on the Shadow
Stream,
In marble, moon colored, for tomb and dower,
Her Lord upbuilded his Dome of Dream.
Together they rest, the sheath and the sword
Sleep side by side, as they slept of old.
In the guarded chamber, the wife and her
lord,
When the counted hours dropt like beads
of gold.
When the judgment comes to the hosts of
the dead
It is written that love shall be more than
prayers;
When their flower-dome falls and their dust
is spread
O Allah ! what boon for such love as
theirs?
N.S.W.
P. E. QUINN.
The Journeying.
My words go by the railway, but my heart
goes by the sea.
For the mail van and the engine they are
all too slow for me !
My written word can loiter, packed away in
bag and crate,
But my gypsy heart goes singing, as a bird
sings, for its mate !
My words go by the railway, over Wallan-
garra’s fiats,
Up to ranges and the fern-growths, spread
like genii’s praying mats,
To the paddocks near Glen Innes, and to
little Loehinvar ;
To the great and dirty coalfields where the
long grey waters are.
And grumbling up the hillside, and shrieking
o’er the bridge.
With a sliding to the hollows and a puffing
up the ridge,
And into Sydney suburbs with their flower-
trimmed diadem.
My words can bide the pleasure of the train
that carries them !
My words go by the railway, but my heart
goes by the sea.
And it flings the fine foam from it in an opal
ecstasy.
And it drives beyond the shipping, and it
races steam and wind.
For there never was a funnel that could
leave my heart behind ;
And it treads forbidden places where the
waves curve clear and green,
But the searchlights cannot find it, for a
heart goes by unseen !
All in a wild rose morning it will come
between the Heads,
When the lazy mists are rising from the
sleepy garden beds;
And though the words come later, coyly
fashioned to deceive.
You will smile and never heed them —-tis
my heart you will believe !--
QUEENSLAND.
M. FORREST.
Buttercups.
Once you held my childish kisses, happy
kisses, warm and red;
In your golden bowls I dropped them that
the fairies, dainty fairies,
When at dawn they climbed dance-weary to
their satin-petalled bed
There might find my friendly offering, take
my kisses, childish kisses,
And. perhaps, leave theirs instead.
Now you hold my woman’s tears, bitter
tears, stinging tears —
No fit gift for dancing fairy, should one
venture down the years.
But one day my love may see you, o’er your
beauty bend his head,
Find my tears, woman’s tears, and leave
perhaps his own instead.

THURSDAY, JANUARY 31, 1918.
NOW WHAT ABOUT WINNING THE
WAR?
Though this paper willingly admits that
the proposal for compulsory military service
has been defeated, it does not admit that
the poll of either last year or the year
before inflicted any serious damage on the
Germans. Nor does it believe that the
war can be won by Australia frequently
registering majorities for No. A preponder-
ance of negatives leaves unaltered two grim
facts. The first is that the struggle in
which the people of this country became
involved three and a half years ago is still
raging. The next is that unless the
western democracies frame the peace which
must some day come, the world which they
and Australia have known will pass into
eclipse. Wherefore, though a substantial
number of the Australian people were in
December against conscription, the problem
before them and all the Allies has still to be
grappled with. Stripped of irrelevancies
that problem, so far as Australia is con-
cerned, is crystallised in two questions: (1)
Where are the men and the means to carry
on the fight 7 (2) What is the war policy
of the Commonwealth 7 It is no use blun-
dering on in the belief that as the Conscrip-
tion issue was negatived there remains
nothing for the Parliament to do except to
sit around the Mace moaning and groaning
part of it over the iniquities of compul-
sion and the others about the futility of
voluntaryism. If the Legislature can do no
more than this it will have gone a long way
towards proving that the Commonwealth has
failed at the first critical test.
As it was never claimed by even the most
embittered opponent of compulsion that if
the Referendum was defeated the enemy
would be annihilated, nor asserted by the
most ardent conscriptionist that rejection
meant defeat without further protest, the
theory that Ministerial billets remain the
sole bone of contention can only be sup-
ported on the assumption that the war has
become a mere rumor. So long as a
majority of the community does not dispute
that there is an Australian army in the
field, the obligation upon the Legislature to
bend its mind to the business of war is as
heavy as when, before the electors, its mem-
bers individually declared their anxiety to
get busy in that direction. The essence of
the situation before Parliament is that there
are in this country thousands of men eligible
for military service, that enlistments are
negligible, and that it has been denied
authority to employ compulsion. Australia
knows what this Parliament will not do. It
will not raise reinforcements by conscription.
What Australia should know, and know
"quickly, is what the Legislature ivill do. The
obviously sane proceeding is to get itself
into a condition to look squarely at its duty,
and then, having decided what it wants to do
and what it can do within the limitations
imposed by the Referendum and the capacity
of the country to pay the bill, to proceed
with the job.
It is not a long job nor one of much diffi-
culty. Conscription being out of the
question, the country has to rely on volun-
taryism. The first questions for Parliament
to determine as a preliminary are these: —
(1) Is the Ministry in office the one best calcu-
lated to get the best results from the voluntary
system ?
(2) What, additional inducements can be held out
to men to enlist?
(3) What organisation of effort will bring more
men into camp?
On whether these questions are answered
in a spirit of narrow partisanship—other-
wise, of rank dishonesty—all that follows
wall depend. If there is a Ministry in office
that has antagonised the great bulk of the
population, there will be not only a failure
of voluntaryism, but a gross failure of Par-
liament. Then when the Commonwealth
has devised a policy that is a policy for
reinforcing the army, there is the other job
of considering the bill. This has been studi-
ously dodged by sucessive Ministries ever
since the war began, and the State Govern-
ments have given great assistance in sup-
plying imitations of Micawber. To speak
about either the Commonwealth or the
States having a financial policy for to-day
or even a shadowy comprehension of finan-
cial policy for to-morrow would be to perpe-
trate a jest. Yet, though there is an inti-
mate connection between war policy and
preservation of the public credit, it is the
bitter truth that Australia has neither
achieved the first nor shown any regard for
the second. If we are to escape the pitiful
experience of having to confess our armies
beaten, not by the German but by the failure
of our own Legislature, the Commonwealth
Parliament will have to get down to bed-
rock promptly and knock off playing the
goat.
SOME SCATTERED THOUGHTS
ABOUT MONEY.
One of these days ill-mannered people will
describe the political situation in Australia
as plain, unvarnished corruption, and will
add insult to injury by proving the charge.
In fact, some people are saying this sort of
thing already. The evil isn’t equally distri-
buted throughout Australia—some . States
have it worse than others, and the Ma
community takes a high place as usual —but
it is practically everywhere. It isn’t exactly
the crude corruption of other days and other
lands, where the price of a vote was handed
out, naked and unashamed, in visible cash.
Yet the manufacture of highly-paid Trade
Commissionerships, so that men who know
nothing about trade may live at ease in
pleasant places where there is no trade to
do, is crude enough. The same may be said
of the six State Agent-Generalships and
many other devices whereby dangerous oppo-
nents or equally dangerous supporters are
bought off. The business of putting returned
soldiers on the land opens up possibilities
for the future, there has been a sudden dis-
covery that a drove of extra Federal Under-
secretaries -w T ill soon be wanted, and it is
indeed a cold day when somebody isn't
appointed to specially inquire into something.
But these are cheap scandals at the worst.
Also they are humorous in a way. When
an aged and humble but consistent supporter
was once made Inspector of Scaffolding in
Sydney he didn’t cost so very much, and he
made the community smile for a full week.
His whiskers became almost historical, he
being a man with a flagrant jungle of hair
hanging at the root of a desolate counten-
ance.
Another form of public dry rot is less
tangible and vastly more expensive. It is
called “the development of the great natural
resources of the country” by means of “per-
manent and reproductive works” paid for
out of loans. Everybody knows that the
works aren’t permanent in the true sense of
the term, for nothing is—only some works
have a temporary immortality while some
are built to-day, and opened with a Minis-
terial lunch to-morrow and shut up as a
failure next year. And they aren’t repro-
ductive in any complete sense; nor are they
meant to be or expected to be. The first
essential of a public work built out of loans
is that it-mustn’t be something so large and
patriotic and far-seeing as to be beyond the
Ministry’s brain capacity. It must be some-
thing easy. Something easy and useless that
won’t pay has much more appeal in it than
something big and necessary that will pay.
The construction of a new r Zoo. at Sydney,
with enlarged accommodation for the bear
with a sore head, was a matter that any
gardener could have devised with the aid of
an intelligent dog, so £lOO.OOO or more was
spent on the job without the sanction of the
Public Works Committee, as provided by
law—the Public Works Committee has long
been a well-paid place of refuge for politi-
cians—and this at a time of stress when the
bear should have been boiled down for soup.
It was typical of a hundred other jobs which
there is no space to enumerate, but it was
a small one by comparison, and the bear is
an object of mirth, udiich is something to
its credit. The business is rotten in the
aggregate, and most of it isn’t mirthful. The
huge loans for “development” don’t develop;
consequently the two most populous States
are steadily losing population save in a
small area which in each case is more or less
closely attached to the bloated capital. There
are ports as capable as Sydney or Mel-
bourne which remain closed because the rail-
ways shy away from them like a startled
horse, and take long, costly detours to avoid
them because the big old cities hate competi-
tion. So the people who should be served
by these ports either fail to arrive or arrive
and get away, and the profitable _ centres
which should arise there don’t arise any
more than they did in Captain Cook’s day.
It would pay to have some new big cities,
but it takes something of a mind to upset
the deep-rooted congestion policy, and it is
less mental strain to run up houses for
returned soldiers on' pocket-handkerchief
suburban allotments. This device is in keep-
ing with the One Big City policy, for it tends
to draw to the crowded old spots population
which was. in part at least, a country
population before the war and to raise a
new generation of hardy bushmen close to
the tramline. #
The people have grown used to this sort
of thing, and the politicians who spend the
high-priced loans on small profitless deeds
because they lack the mental furniture for
big ones are kept in office by folk who have
grown used to the policy of small things and
plenty of them. The Holman species of
politician is partly the product of the times
and partly the cause of them, and the resem-
blance is so remarkable that it is hard to
say which is more like the other and which
isn’t. The system pays high wages and
plenty of them to supporters and possible
supporters, and that is the whole gospel of
politics. Of course, as the yearly expendi-
ture on the “reproductive” work increases
the works grow less reproductive because the
few which pay their way have to carry
the huge dead pauper of those which don’t,
and the pauper grows larger and deader
every day. In proportion to the resources
of the people the pension system of Australia
—or most of Australia —is one of the world’s
marvels, but the bulk of the pensioners aren’t
human —they are railways and dams and
land-resumptions and such-like. Many a
ravening Grand Duke is cheaper than a
permanent and reproductive work, and he
hasn’t to be renewed at a steadily-increasing
interest rate. In N. S. Wales’s most enthu-
siastic years it has probably taken £2,000,000
or £4,000,000 of costly loan money to keep
Premier Holman on his throne. That is to
say, when £7,000,000 or £9,000,000 of loan
outburst —allegedly reproductive—only yields
interest on £5.000,000, there is nothing to
show for the balance except that Premier
Holman and his colleagues retained their
jobs. They had to do something to justify
their existence, and they did the only thing
they knew of. When the present public
works system goes bankrupt, some other jus-
tification will have to be devised, and then
somebody will have to take to real hard work
or else turn Bolshevik and repudiate the past
and start afresh. It is only a question of
extending the scope of the moratorium and
making its operation permanent like the
reproductive works.
THE SHOW THAT FAILED.
War being a diversion, something devised
primarily to entertain and use up surplus
energy, any particular performance may
fairly come under criticism with regard to
its artistic excellence. Thus as to the Nor-
man Conquest of England—an entertain-
ment provided for restless Normans and
their friends who were feeling bored by life
in their own land, and in their boredom
were becoming dangerous—the experienced
eye simply cannot help noticing first the
excellence of the setting. The sensational
landing at Hastings, the repeated charges up
the hill at Senlac, the sudden death of
Harold, the swift collapse of the Saxon
kingdom—all these were dramatic events
which thoroughly interested both actors and
onlookers. William knew that his fol-
lowers wanted to be kept from dull mo-
notony. Kings are never in such danger as
when their fighting men eat up the surround-
ing air with yawns. There were no picture-
shows in the conquered territory, so Wil-
liam had to think out something for his men
to do. He managed it very cleverly.
Nobody got a big enough share of land in
any one part of the country to allow of his
raising an army on a single estate. The
valiant knight who had 2000 acres given
him in Norfolk got his next allotment of
spoil in Berkshire, and his third in Devon.
As a result he was kept riding backwards
and forwards from Norfolk to Devon by
way of Berkshire, in order to see that his
nossessions stayed in their places. This
gave him fine exercise, afforded him fre-
quent change of air'and left him very little
time to think about killing the king. But
as time went on and the novelty of keeping
Saxon churls in their place wore off, the
danger re-asserted itself and monarchs had
to think up new wars. Richard’s cru-
sading expedition, the attacks on Scotland
of Edward I. and Edward 11., the inva-
sions of France by Edward 111. and Henry
V. were all of this nature. Foreign wars
were the entertainment provided by the
king in return for his throne; and the kings
who didn’t prove good “producers” got into
trouble.
While war is stili tolerated by civilisation
and great military and naval establishments
are kept up, there is always the danger that
the modern king will follow the old line of
least resistance. Nothing rouses enthusiasm
like a good international bout of killing; and
though the real kings of these days may not
be the ones who wear gold hats, the tempta-
tion to let armies loose is still very great.
Government is a difficult business; and the
more autocratic it is the greater are its
dangers. Democracies —or the things that
wear the label —are ticklish things to handle;
but the results of failure to manage the
affairs of a more or less free people are
seldom serious. The autocratic boss, on the
other hand, has no minor difficulties to con-
tend with ; all his troubles are on a tragic
scale. He can steal, perpetrate injustice,
play the traitor, and do all manner of iniqui-
ties in a general way: but in blocking re-
forms and denying freedom he is in constant
dansrer of knife and bomb. To the simple
minds of the people who groan under auto-
era tic rule the first of all reforms is tne
murder of the autocrat. The peril is not
active at all times; but the moment the cry
becomes urgent for reform the astute tyrant
has to cast about for something to divert
public attention. Nothing lies so ready to
his hand as the old entertainment of war.
Give the people a fair-sized spectacle or
international bloodshed and they forget most
of their personal wrongs until long after the
curtain has been rung down on the last
charge. The present war probably owes its
magnitude and circumstance to the fact that
three tremendous despotisms were all in tne
same fix at the same time. Russian bosses felt
that they were on a volcano, and that nothing
but a grand fanfare of cannon could save
them; Austria’s Imperial dodderer felt the
same thing; Wilhelm of Germany weighed
the growing power of the Socialism he had
pretended to pet and foster, and saw a choice
between a revolution that left him shamed
and helpless and a war that might main-
tain the dynasty for years. So the guns
were wheeled out; and the terrific entertain-
ment began that was to arouse all onlook-
ers to a pitch of excitement under cover of
which the kings could keep on doing exactly
as they pleased.
# * * *
Viewed critically between the acts, the
performance thus far has not been a success.
Never before was a war staged with such
properties, dressed at such lavish cost and
played with such a numerous cast; yet the
spectacular triumphs aimed at have been so
poor that again and again the principal
actors have been hissed. The single battle
which William the Conqueror staged for a
few hours on the hill at Senlac had more
dramatic power about it than all that
Wilhelm and the Austrian actor-managers
have been able to display. The little war
in the Crimea, which provided England and
Russia with loud cheers for a short season,
had more striking situations than the whole
of the great Teuton effort. The fact is that
in the present war far too much attention
has been given to the mere mechanism of
the thing; every spectacle has been on so
exaggerated a scale that it has been impos-
sible to see the battles for the fighting; and
there has not been nearly enough comedy
element to relieve the utter gloom of the
tragic passages. The nations have not been
entertained; they have been bored and
wearied ; and there are probably not half a
dozen people on earth —outside the profiteers
who take the money at the door —who re-
gard the show as having been in any way
worth while. How far Wilhelm’s reputa-
tion has sunk in Germany it is impossible
to know; but Russia has already hooted the
principal performers off her end of the stage
and Austria appears to be hurling the dead
cat at her boss showmen. Summed up, on
the appearance of things at the close of the
fourth act —or is it only the third?—the
whole performance points to the certainty
that war as an entertainment provided _by
kings has lost its charm and popularity.
Bear-baiting might revive; the Roman
gladiatorial contests might be the natural
sequel and evolution of modern boxing ; but
war cannot come again. It has blown itself
dead with too many fireworks and spoiled
its pathos with too many graves. And if
that is so, what is to become of kings? An
attempt to solve the puzzle is probably keep-
ing more than one of them awake at nights.
THE BRITISH SOLOMON ISLANDS
AND THEIR ADMINISTRATION.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
Until this century the Solomon Islands were
commercially of no value. The haunts of
savage and unfriendly nativefe, they had never-
theless become the richest recruiting grounds
for Queensland sugar fields, where the mon-
strous inhumanity of white men, calling
themselves Britishers, caused wholesale
devastation and, what is a hundred times
worse, passed on a curse in the form of
sexual disease which in more cases than one
has recoiled upon our race. That was
20 years and more ago; and the laws made
then for fiends who never settled in the
islands are still in force, and, what is more,
have been added to, not because white men's
crimes have increased, for it is quite the
contrary, but because British officials have,
through the gross ignorance of British states-
men who have added neglect to their ignor-
ance, been permitted to set up an official
autocracy.
In these days the Solomons are of incal-
culable commercial value ; immense cocoanut
plantations are scattered far and wide, no
longer clinging to the coastal lands, but
running away to the hill tops, and as vigor-
ous in theit growth there as those sucking
the sea waters; British and Australian
Capital has been invested to the extent of
millions; white population is rapidly increas-
ing, and hundreds of white women now
reside there. Copra that sold 20 years ago,
a rough, crude commercial nondescript, at
£S per ton, is selling to-day in France and
America at sometimes over £IOO per ton,
and frequently at £BO per ton; hardly a
steamer leaves the islands these days without
a cargo worth nearly £50,000.
Here we have on the one side well-
directed private enterprise striving to achieve
its laudable ambitions, and on the other a
Government that has in the most deliberate
manner set up every obstacle to commercial
progress—a Government that has openly
boasted, through its leading officials, that
it would prefer the Chinaman to the white
man at any time. Yet the white man to
be found in the Solomons is a keen, straight
goer, there for the purpose of working and
spending his money for the development of
the islands, and intent upon their progress.
There is little wonder that such men are in
almost open rebellion and for the second time
are petitioning the Imperial Government for
relief and a suitable administration. Within
the whole British Empire there will not be
found in any possession such a bitterness of
feeling, such an open aggressiveness towards
an administration, as now exists here.
The administration is responsible to the
Government of Fiji. The High Commis-
sioner of Fiji draws a good part of his salary
from the settlers. Yet not once in the whole
term of his office, which ends soon, has he
visited the islands. And why? Because there


is not at liis disposal any vessel of sufficient
comfort and of a class suitable to the
dignity of his position ! Official aggression
has had full freedom in the Solomons, and
there is little wonder that disloyalty to the
empire is heard from many settlers, who are
suffering tyranny hard to believe possible in
British territory.
This Administration gives native employees
bank holidays, when there is no such thing
as a bank in the whole of the Solomons, and
the natives don’t know what a bank is; it
demands such a dietary scale that every day
the waste on plantations of such foods as
rice, tinned meats, biscuits, etc., is posi-
tively wicked; it pampers the native and
makes him what he is, a loafer, and as cun-
ning as a racecourse sharper. And all the
time there is a grievous waste of public
money. For instance, the Government
steamer in 1916 cost for upkeep no less than
£4OOO, though for 290 days out of the 365
she lay idle in Tulagai harbor, a big item
for island finances to stand.
But there are features worse than these
that call for prompt inquiry by the Imperial
Government. Not only planters, traders
and recruiters, but missionaries, are con-
stantly appealing to the Administration for
protection from the natives, whose depreda-
tions include human life; and human life to
be taken not by bows and arrows, but by
the modern rifle. In the land of the head-
hunters, every plantation, every trading
station, every mission must have its armed
guard, day and night, to enable work to go
on and to keep stores safe fram raiding.
This is the meaning of British protection in
the Solomons—that the natives are allowed
to carry on tribal warfare, to burn, to mas-
sacre and to destroy; and then it is pro-
claimed there is a shortage of native labor !
And what does the Administration say when
taxed with this? “It is no . business of
ours!" Britishers made it their business to
stop the burning of widows in India. Why
cannot they stop tribal warfare in the Solo-
mons? The atrocities committed by the
natives upon women are almost unbelievable.
They are unspeakably horrible.
Confirmation can be given from an official
report which reads as follows: —
The native population has been estimated to be
150,000, including the natives of the outlying islands
of Santa Cruz and Lord Howe. Owing to various
causes the native population is said to be decreasing ;
during the past 18 months a large number has been
carried off by dysentery; the island of San Cristoval
appears to have lost more from this cause than other
islands, whilst in some districts whole villages were
wiped out. Malaita remains the most densely popu-
lated, but dysentery and the continual fighting among
themselves must have greatly reduced their num-
bers. On Choiseul, where there has been incessant
intertribal fighting during the past year, it is
reported that numbers of men, women and children
have been killed. In the Shortland district the
decrease is very marked.
On this confession alone it is time these
islands were put under more suitable admin-
istration. A continuation of what is going
on in the Solomons is impossible, unless we
are to leave Britain and British ideals, open
to misinterpretation and ridicule.

PLAIN ENGLISH.
When Billjim Is Done With.
Dear Bulletin, —It is surprising how little
is heard in this country about War Pensions.
Certainly it is not because everyone is satis-
fied, and it can only be attributed to Bill-
jim’s cheerfulness and his casual way of
putting up with things. The story has been
spread, too, that the Australian War Pen-
sion is the highest in the world. This is
by no means the case. The Australian full
pension for a private (single) is 30s. per
week. In England it is 275. 6d., but there
a provision is made that, where a disabled
man can show that his minimum pension,
plus any allowance for children that he may
have plus the average earnings of which he
is still capable, make a sum less than his
average pre-war earnings, he may be granted
a pension which together with average earn-
ings of which he may be deemed capable
shall not exceed his pre-war earnings up to
a maximum of 50s. per week, plus half any
pre-war earnings between 50s. and 100 s. This
provision may best be understood by a con-
crete case. Take a man who was earning
£4 per week before the war and is now totally
disabled. For his total disablement his
weekly pension is £1 7s. 6d. Presuming he
can now earn nothing, he can claim a pen-
sion of £2 10s. plus half his former earnings
between £2 10s. and £4 (viz., 155.), making
a total of £3 ss. per week. It will thus be
seen that a man’s pension in England can
be considerably higher than here, though the
cost of living is lower there. Now in regard
to married men. In Australia a wife is
granted a pension in her own right of half
the amount her husband is receiving, and
pensions are also granted for children, if
any. In England a wife does not receive a
pension of her own, except when her hus-
band is receiving treatment or training, and
then she is granted what is there called a
separation allowance. Children are granted
pensions as here, but on a slightly iower
scale. It wouldjippear that in the granting
of pensions to wives in Australia some regu-
lation is required, for in a number of cases
wives on being granted their nension have
immediately left their husbands. A provision
is required enabling the cancellation of a
pension under such circumstances. Again,
should a single pensioner marry, his wife is
granted a pension of half her husband’s.
Now, there is no wish to prevent the man
who has fought for his country marrying;
but when cases,.are seen of men suffering
from tuberculosis and other infectious com-
plaints doing so immediately on their arrival
home it would seem that there is a class of
woman willing even at personal risk to
marry these poor fellows, sometimes, unfor-
tunately, solely with a view to obtaining
pensions for themselves. There is a class of
men who are laboring under a manifest in-
justice, i.e., men who are receiving treatment
and are in receipt of less than full pensions.
It would be impossible for these men to live
and continue their treatment if it were not
for the Patriotic Funds which supplement
their pensions; but is it right that the funds
should be called upon to do what is
undoubtedly the duty of the Commonwealth?
The class that presents the greatest difficulty
is largely the product of our voluntary sys-
tem of enlistment. It consists of men who
have been returned for some complaint or
injury which existed prior to their enlist-
ment. In some instances they have seen
active service; in many they have never
reached the firing-line. What is the posi-
tion ? Is the Government responsible for
having enlisted them and sent them away,
and are they entitled to be granted a pen-
sion on their present condition or to the
extent to vshich their complaint or injury
has been aggravated by service? This class
includes the old men who have mis-stated
their age on enlistment in order to get away.
Thev have had a few weeks in the trenches
and have been robbed of all future useful-
ness in life, and, though unemployable, are
discharged with a pension of 7s. 6d. per
w r eek, the result being that they must become
a charge on the patriotic funds, and, later,
on the State, which has had nothing to do
with wrongfully enlisting them and sending
them away. When it is said that a large
percentage of the men returned up to the
present are within this category it will be
realised how serious the position is. What
is the remedy? Pensions and Repatriation
should be merged into one. Pensions when
granted should be assessed on the permanent
incapacity, provision being made for the
automatic supplementation of the permanent
pension, if less than full, while the men are
in receipt of treatment or training and until
employment is obtained; provision also
being made for a reduction in the case of a
man refusing treatment or training when
certified as in need of and fit for the same.
Regulations governing the granting of pen-
sions to wives of pensioners should also be
drafted. And, finally, military and civil
doctors should be represented on the pen-
sion boards, which should consist of three
members, preferably one military and two
civil. —A Voluntary Worker.
We Can Do It as Well as Uncle Sam.
From a progressive Australian manufac-
turer :
After spending three months in the U.S.A. visiting
such cities as New York, Chicago, Boston, Cincin-
nati, Pittsburgh, Dayton, Detroit, Los Angeles and
’Frisco, I feel there are several things I want to
let Australians know.
Australia is the better country to work and live
in. The climate in the eastern States of America is
too cold —so cold, in fact, that it becomes a hard-
ship to be out of doors in winter. The cost of living
in Australia was, when I left about six months ago,
just about half what it is here, and rents in
Chicago and New York are very high. The living
conditions of the great bulk of the workers in the
big cities are wretched and cainnot be compared
with ours.
Most of the industries here work 54 hours per
week in summer and 60 in winter. There is little
or no Government control or regulation of either
wages or hours ; but in some States there are laws
about heating and ventilating factory buildings, and
certain restrictions are placed upon child labor.
In many of the large plants a very high state of
efficiency is reached, and it is in these plants that
the highest wages are earned, shortest hours worked
and the best conditions prevail; and in almost every
instance the product is so low-priced that it com-
mands a world’s market.’ I want to impress this
fact upon the employers as well as the workers in
Australia: It is the product of the up-to-date, well-
equipped, highly-paid factory that holds the markets
for the U.S.A.
A very large proportion of the workers here are
Italians, Hungarians, etc., and they cannot be com-
pared with our Australian workers, who are their
superior in every way. After having seen and
studied the American workman at work, I am con-
vinced that our Australians are quicker and better
workers, and if Australian employers could only
realise what magnificent material they have, as
compared with the American employer, we would
have more industrial peace.
One thing that has struck me throughout has been
the courteous way the big American employer speaks
to his employee, whether manager or laborer. Very
often, it is true, the one addressed cannot under-
stand English. Some of the factories have notices
posted in a dozen different languages. Australian
employers possess a great advantage in having
workers who can read and write English; it sim-
plifies management so much.
I have studied my own particular business very
carefully in America, and am proud to be able to
say that, generally speaking, our Australian workers
are producing as much per week as American workers,
working under like conditions, and are doing it in
six hours less. The wages earned are practically the
same in both countries.
What we want in Australia is more confidence in
ourselves, bigger ideas and more constructive
thought. When I see the wonderful business that
America has built up, both at home and abroad, and
the poor class of labor that she has done it with, l
have to take my hat off to her Captains of Industry.
They are truly big men with big ideas. They think
in continents. And I say to the employers of Aus-
tralia : Have confidence. Acquire the big outlook.
And get to it.
Re Hughes v. Watson.
Dear Bulletin, —When the settlement of
this action first took place I refrained from
disclosing the terms to the press, believing
that it was no part of my duty as a solicitor
to publish abroad my client’s affairs. In
view, however, of the statements made by
members during the recent no-confidence
debate in the House of Representatives, I
now feel it incumbent upon me to set out
the truth concerning the matter in justice to
the defendant, David Watson. In the course
of the debate it was asserted by members
sitting on the Government side of the House
that Watson had withdrawn his charges
and that Hughes had emerged triumphant
and covered in glory. The fact is that the
action was settled on terms favorable to my
client both in honor and from a monetary
standpoint, and the negotiations for settle-
ment were commenced, not by Watson, but
by or on behalf of the Prime Minister, 'mere
is no vestige of truth in the allegation that
Watson withdrew one single word of what
lie said either in the House or at the party
meeting. From first to last he stood firm
in the assertion that every word he had
spoken was the unvarnished truth, which
attitude he still maintains. Shortly before
the action was to come to trial overtures
were made by certain friends of Mr. Hughes
for a settlement, and proposals were sub-
mitted and discussed, the action being
adjourned pending the discussion of these
terms. Watson refused to entertain the
terms of settlement offered on behalf of
Hughes, but made two counter proposals,
and in September last I informed the other
side that unless they accepted one or the
other of those proposals without further
delay the action must proceed to trial. This
brought forth an immediate acceptance of
one of our offers, and the action was settled
on these terms-—that while Watson did not
withdraw anything that he had said either
in the Senate or at the party meeting, he
stated that his intention in making those
statements was not to charge Hughes with
bribery, but to protect his own and his
party’s interests. This offer, which was sub-
ject to the payment of Watson’s costs by
Hughes, was agreed to, and the costs were
ultimately paid.—Yours faithfully, Gordon
J Holmes, solicitor for David Watson.
If John Bull Votes No.
It is mentioned with regret that so far no
buyer has appeared for the new Australian
wheat crop. The State and Federal autho-
rities are, of course, pledged to buv the crop
at a cost of £16.000,000 or £17,000,000, but
if they can’t sell the goods the promissory-
note given in payment is likely to be a very
pathetic and depreciated document. And if
the goods can’t be exported, even the pro-
missory-note may not be forthcoming in
another 12 months. So far the British
Government has been the principal buyer—
at its own price of course; for when the
helpless Australian can’t deliver his wheat
in the world’s markets he is wholly at the
mercy of the rare purchaser who is willing
to take delivery here and be his own sea
carrier. Now, even Bull's immense mercan-
tile fleet is kept so busy in one way and
another by the war that he hasn’t managed
to get more than a fraction of the wheat he
has paid for away to his own hungry land.
Even if the price paid for Australian wheat
is not very high Bull therefore made a poor
bargain, and it is quite possible that when he
has finished paying up on the present con-
tract he may think hard before renewing it
.on the old terms. He may simply vote No.
Britain may be hungry, but over 9,000.000
bags of provender stacked at N. S. Wales
railway stations —which is over 20 times as
much as was similarly bogged at the same
places two years ago—make it no less
hungry, and N. S. Wales isn’t much worse in
this respect than its neighbors. Our valued
old parent may quite logically remark that
there is an almost unlimited and high-priced
market for foodstuffs delivered in London
or Liverpool or Glasgow, and that if the
seller will deliver there the old man will
be so glad to see him that he will nearly
blow off his waistcoat-buttons with applause.
In a country where it is quite common for
a loaf and 41b. of bacon to be delivered at
the buyer’s door this attitude—if our leading
customer should adopt it —will he quite
understandable. Australia has had one
referendum and another referendum, and it
has a hopelessly unfinished Sydney city rail-
way, and a practically uninhabited Federal
capital which has been a sink for money, and
a scheme for State life insurance in Queens-
land. and a dream about the N.S.W. Govern-
ment buying up all the Cornstalk coal-
mines and paying for them with its lOTJ,
but nothing has been done to provide for the
grievous possibility that the Bull Govern-
ment may be driven to pay for wheat and
wool and meat and copper only on delivery.
Yet when that handy old cargo-carrier the
Gabo, of 2000 tons, came on the market the
other day she was sold to a Chinaman instead
of being acquired as a wheat-ship. Not that
one Gabo would make much difference, hut
the ancient sea warrior was one of the
straws which show how the wind blows.
The Struggle in the Bush.
“R.F.W.” FKOM the Dorrigo big timber: —
“Mookumwh'YßEßa” (B. 3/l/’18) makes out a
good case for the increased timber royalties in N. S.
Wales, the apparent uselessness of the Forestry Com-
mission and the shameful waste of timber, especially
of the fast-disappearing hoop-pine; but when he
leaves such obvious facts and deals with the alleged
huge profits made by sawmillers, he gets
bogged. His statement that “the main factor in the
huge increase in the cost of pine is the practical
elimination from competition of Baltic Oregon’’ is,
as far as this part of N. S. Wales is concerned, totally
wrong. In three years we have seen the cost of
logs, labor, transport, saws, oils, etc., practically
doubled. “Mookumwhybera.” reckons that there is
a wide margin between 9d. per 100 ft. (presenc
royalty) and 255. to 30s. per 100 ft. charged for their
output by the millers. There is ; but the following
figures have to be crowded in:—‘
Cost per 100 ft. (in log) up to December, 1917 6/3
Deduction for waste, 20 p.c. (say) .. .. 1/-
Cost of milling, docking, stacking, classing, etc. 4/8
Freight to Bellingen .. .. . • ■ • 47-
Freight to Sydney .. .. .. •• 4/0
Total 20/3
To these charges must be added wharfage and insur-
ance and (from this month onward) a further 9d.
per 100 ft. increased royalty.
*Kven then a margin of profit is shown; but, often,
special conditions butt in. For instance, our Dorrigo
timber must be carted 20 miles over one of the worst
roads in the world, including seven miles down the
blastiferous Dorrigo mountain, while the ends of our
cherished 18in. boards bang an accompaniment. If
“Mookum, etc.,” could see some of the deductions
for “split ends,” he would not mind if I slipped
another shilling into the expense account. The
miller “glutton” quoted by “M.,” who made £3OOO
in six months, was not up against these conditions.
I strongly suspect him of being a liar, anyhow.
“Mookum’s” reference to the harassed toiler who
cannot make the price of bowyangs and dungarees
at cutting and hauling logs will bring a grin to the
dial of many a miller as he hands out the monthly
cheques. A pine-faller in this district would turn
the glassy eye on any proposition that did not yield
him £1 per day; and if the bullocky, after a full
month’s toil, does not average about 30s. per day he
proceeds to embalm the atmosphere in his time-
honored way.
Every miller with the interests of the industry at
heart must agree that the waste of the heads of trees
is horrible; but would “Mookumwhybeka” like to
cut box timber and broom handles at a price that would
not pay for haulage? Those lines are probably pro-
fitable to men in the business who are alongside a
railway, or who can take contracts with a reasonable
prospect of being able to fill them ; but we on the
Dorrigo cannot make forward contracts while our
timber is likely to lie at a bar-bound port for
months, and then, as frequently happens, be washed
out to sea by floods.
If a percentage of the increased royalty could be
retained in the district that earns it for the build-
ing of decent roads it would prove a blessing to a
sorely-harassed industry. Two mills, within 10 miles
of Dorrigo, have been unable to get a load of sawn
timber out of their yards for weeks, the track being
impassable. Our hopes of rail have vanished with
the lately-removed buildings that housed the Norton
Griffiths smell, so we must continue to battle with
the primitive conditions that obtained when the first
settlers, deluded with promises of a railway, began
to belt a living out of the scrub with axe and fire.
Within a five-mile radius of where I write timber
valued at £5,000,000 has gone up in smoke for the
lack of decent roads and transport facilities. And
there is a lot more to go up yet.
»
The Possibility of Talking Ships into
the Water.
As a general rule nothing is finished until
after it has been commenced, and acting
upon this principle a busy little Sydney citi-
zen has managed to achieve results while
other people were merely displacing the
atmosphere. Dr. Arthur, M.L.A., seized
with the notion that homes should be built
for returned soldiers, long ago began calling
upon his fellow citizens to help him build
the chimney, or put -on the roof, or deposit
material for the verandah on the section, or
supply a few nails. No matter what may
be said about all this, there is the inescap-
able fact that houses have materialised —that
where before was only air are now dwellings
composed of material previously lying about
the continent. Of course, Arthur has talked
a lot. He had to. But he talked bricks into
walls, and his conversation put timber on
carts and nailed windows in and put a handle
on the kitchen door. Now The Bulletin
earnestly implores another busy little man
to talk a ship into existence instead of talk-
ing Australia to death. For nine months W.
Hughes has been holding conferences about
shipbuilding, announcing that something
was going to be none, making final arrange-
ments, explaining that another conference
would be held shortly, bringing matters to a
head, getting everything into working order
and ensuring success for an industry which
unless firmly established would lead to the
disruption of the Empire. Why not appoint
Arthur as publicity-agent and get down to
plain business? Arthur, this paper takes it,
would at once proceed to waylay all the
reporters, with the result that to-morrow
every citizen would be reading something like
this: —•
SHIPS TO BE BUILT AT ONCE!
PRIME MINISTER TAKES ACTION.
FOOD FOR THE ALLIES.
It has been decided by Mr. Hughes that a begin-
ning shall be made on Saturday with the construc-
tion of ships to carry Australian produce oversea.
Flag of the Stars.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
The flag of the Southern Cross was hoisted on
Eureka Stockade, Ballarat, 63 "years ago in Decem-
ber, 1854, to the accompaniment of the oath of the
rebellion: “We swear bv the Southern Cross to be
true to each other, and to fight to defend our rights
and liberties.”
Flag of the Stars! The azure gonfalon
That is the sign and symbol of our land,
Shot-torn and bloodied, when it lost it won
For us a destiny and high command —
Firm as our granite, deep as sky and sea,
The stainless faith that bows no craven knee!
Flag of the Stars ! Eureka’s sun still burns
The old-world draff, the old-world craft
and lies;
Steadfast we hold the quality that spurns
The quibble and the traitorous surmise.
Dare we forget the duty that you made
Ours when you floated over the Stockade?
Flag of the Stars! Spread nightly in our
skies,
Covering our Mother, body, foot and hand,
Nor king nor kaiser, nor their swords nor
lies,
Shall bear our banner from its high com-
mand ;
Nor baulk the destiny that gives thee wings
Above the bloody banners of all kings.
Flag of the Stars! Of our white continent
The shield, redemption, promise and the
sign ;
Depth of the sea, height of the firmament,
Be in our love for thee, and all of thine !
Emblem of wide content, of bale and barge ;
Hope of the white man’s world from marge
to marge.
Flag of the Stars! That sees old shibboleth —
Catch-words from old-world lands—grow
weak and die;
Old-world beliefs become but empty breath,
And kings as phantoms, myths and
mockery.
Land that did make us, take us, break us
when*
Thou, as our Mother, shall demand thy men.
Flag of the Stars! Height saves thee from
the mire
As distance saved when shame the lands
defiled ;
Fate held our white isle sea-walled from the
fire—
No tyrant piping our free ears beguiled.
So let our height and distance be from
wrong—
Till faith grow vocal in Australia’s song.
Flag of the Stars! Wave message to our
men,
To tender wife and old and failing sire,
To give, with gladness, life and courage, when
Come storm and stress ashore with steel
and fire ;
Giving our Mother, loving, loved and blest,
The life she gave back to her gracious breast.
Flag of the Stars ! Clean as thy high-swumg
field
Shall be our love for thee, our sacred land :
The brightness that the Cross of Stars can
yield
Be in our souls to make-pure our command.
Flag of the Stars! As aspirant and high
As thee, be our desire for thee to die!
QUEENSLAND.

All that is wanted is material and men. Mr. Hughes
therefore invites every citizen willing to lend a hand
in this great national work to assemble at the Town
Hall at 6 a.m. on Sunday, bringing with him his
lunch, a hammer and some nails, and any spare
timber available. The citizens who answer this
summons will be conveyed on lorries to the water-
front, where immediately on arrival a start will be
made laying the keels of as many vessels as possible.
Donations oi material will be thankfully received,
and it is the particular wish of Mr. Hughes that
the ladies will take the opportunity of witnessing
the proceedings and providing additional refresh-
ments.
By the.se methods Arthur has achieved
houses. It is obviously within the compe-
tence of Hughes to achieve ships by the
same system if all other means fail to
assemble a single packet of bolts and a
crosscut-saw at any identifiable spot. It may
be that in a democracy all national under-
takings should be carried on by voluntary
effort, and that by this means we would ail
be inspired with a higher sense of citizenship
and common brotherhood. Hughes in asso-
ciation with Arthur might be the standard-
bearers of a new evangel. The Bulletin
does not know. It only knows that jawing
about ships is inexpressibly wearisome, and
that until somebody gets to work no ships
will be launched. Will Hughes do some-
thing? Or get out of the way and let some-
body else do something?
Cheese and Mites.
Woodrow Wilson having spoken again and
Lloyd George having delivered another
speech, the German Imperial Chancellor has
made a few remarks. And if anyone can
read into Von Hertling’s observations any
indication that the Kaiser is anxious to talk
peace except upon the basis of a substantial
swag for Prussia, then such person has an
advantage over this paper. The German
Chancellor says in effect to the Allies: “We
are ready to discuss bringing the war to an
end provided you are ready to give us what
we want. If you are not prepared to do this
—well, God is with us, and through Von
llindenbubg and Ludendorf will compel
you to.” No matter how this ’speech may
be discounted nor what ridicule is thrown
upon the German claims, there is no getting
away from this —that there is a confidence
about it which gives no support to the
theory that the German’s tail is down.
There has been no qualification, apparently,
about the German demands on Russia
either. Whatever differences there may be
between Berlin and Vienna concerning the
dismemberment of the Bear are in all pro-
bability being much exaggerated ; in any case
Germany and Austria are not likely to come
to loggerheads so long as both parties can
sit back and watch the Russian cut his own
throat. This he seems to be doing with
increasing thoroughness, to the great satis-
faction of Potsdam. Meanwhile though
General Rain has enforced a stay of pro-
ceedings in France and Flanders, the
enemy’s activities elsewhere have been fairly
extensive. The announcement that 1350
tons of bacon and 1800 tons of cheese had
been sunk during one week in December on
the way to John Bull is a reminder that
this country’s leg has been pulled about the
solving of the submarine and torpedo pro-
blems. The food difficulty is, indeed, begin-
ning to reach the stage to which the Ger-
man had counted on bringing it, and even if
it .be not. possible for him to starve the
Allies out it is a long way from being certain
that, after a time, there will be much more
in British kitchens than there is in the
German’s; and it is not at all certain either
that the British will stand an empty stomach
more stoically. Maybe this has something
to do with the development of a campaign
in London to secure a change in the higher
command of the British forces with a view
to pressing matters forward. Whether there
are better men available than those in com-
mand—how can we know ? We cannot even
know how bad (or good) those in command
are: for operations during the past two
years have been heavily camouflaged. So
much has this been so that in at least three
important instances there has be,en gross
distortion. That, of course, is not Haig’s
fault. It may not be his fault that distor-
tion was deemed necessary. But it may be.
Considering the school in which they were
trained, it would be almost miraculous if
Haig and Robertson could do their job in a
plain, business-like way. Already changes
have been initiated for co-ordinating the
strategy of the allied forces. Alterations
have been made in commands in Italy and
France and Germany. The Bulletin is
not going to be surprised to see something
of the kind occurring soon in connection with
the British armies, both at the War Office
and in the field. But it will be neither
elated nor disappointed, mainly because it
doesn’t know even a fractional part of what
there is to know about the matter. What
it does know is (1) that if the German can
be pitched out the time is ripe for someone
to do it, and (2) it is by no means certain
that, unless the American can push in very
quickly, Time is fighting with the Allies.
This makes it urgently necessary that we
should make our own utmost effort quickly.
The deplorable fact is that, our little tinpot
political crisis being past, we are making
practically no effort at all. Two months
ago the country was overrun with politicians
canvassing for votes. We shall be surprised
if there are in the whole continent six
politicians who at this moment are canvass-
ing for recruits.
No man ever started a job under more un-
favorable conditions than those that faced
S. A. Pethebridge when he was made
Administrator at Rabaul, German New
Guinea. The whole truth about the matter
will probably never be told; but it is
admitted that the very early Australian
“administration” left a stain which needed a
lot of wiping out, and Pethebridge, till then
secretary to the Defence Department, under-
took the job. The Bulletin’s contributor,
Tiios. J. McMahon, impartially summed-up
the results (B. 17/1/’18) after recent per-
sonal inspection and inquiry :
On his arrival in German New Guinea Samuel
Pethebridge found chaos such as might and would
have dismayed many a capable man; found revenues
and their channels destroyed; found the Germans
sullen, treacherous, and attempting risings almost
every day for months ; found trade smashed, and the
whole prospects of the territory so blighted that it
did not seem worth an effort to restore it. When
these tilings are remembered and the position to-day
is considered, there can be no question that good
work has been done. Not only has every previous
channel of revenue been restored, but new ones have
been added, until the annual revenues are practically
double what they ever were in the German days.
These revenues carry on the territory and entail no
direct charge on the Commonwealth for administra-
tion. By tact, combined with firmness, the Admin’s
trator has settled definitely the restlessness of the
Germans; they admit they are getting a fair deal,
such as they might expect under British military
occupation.
But the man has had to pay the price : he
contracted malaria and died of heart-failure
last week while on furlough in Melbourne.
Now, his work done, over his grave Aus-
tralia may well say her thanks to him for not
only retrieving her good name in the German
colony, but for demonstrating Australia’s
capacity to administer a captured territory
with tact and justice and all those other
qualities of which success is compounded.
The rumor that President Wilson has at
last taken a hand in Irish affairs does not
exactly snatch the breath away; for as the
U.S.A. are more Irish than the British Isles,
it seemed inevitable that sooner or later
America must speak. Like Hellas of
ancient memory, Ireland has no territorial
boundaries. Where the Hellenic language
was spoken and the Hellenic institutions
prevailed, there was Hellas. In the Crimea,
in Sicily, and in the south of Gaul there
were Greek colonies—they were all Greece
to the man in Athens or Corinth. So it has
come to be with the Irish race. Good
enough colonists under any flag, they still
have the passionate attachment to national
ideas and ideals ; and in numerical strength
the world-wide Ireland is pretty well as big
as England. So, this vast Ireland outside the
land betw’een Donegal and Wexford having
at last become articulate, there is a great
thrill of hope running from Moyle to Kerry,
and from Sydney to New York, that the
seven hundred years war between Celt and
Saxon is very nearly over.
-♦
“Phthisis” : Of all the farces being staged
by the Defence Department the Mont Park
(Vic.) Sanatorium is the saddest. Young
men’s lives are being thrown away there.
Anybody who understands tuberculosis
knows that most early cases can be cured if
given a prolonged, uninterrupted course of
good food, fresh air and rest, with gentle,
graduated exercise; but anything in the
shape of dissipation, over-exertion or excite-
ment is fatal to progress, and a few hours’
indulgence may undo the work of months of
patient treatment. Yet to people living
near Mont Park it is a common thing to
see unfortunate men coming home at all
hours, dead tired, apparently well under the
influence of alcohol, some obviously in a
high fever, and with a long uphill walk
before them. Even in the sanatorium itself
life seems to be a round of billiards, cards,
concerts and visitors —all very enjoyable,
no doubt; but things which no State or pri-
vate sanatorium would tolerate. The suf-
ferers also travel up and down in the sub-
urban trains, and do not appear to be sup-
plied with sputum flasks. In a private in-
stitution four or five guineas a week would
be charged for treatment and board alone.
At Mont Park clothes and Red Cross com-
forts of all kinds are given in addition to
treatment and board, many extras are pro-
vided, and, to cap all, the men are on full
pay or pension. Surely, then, it is not too
much to expect the recipients to submit to
the necessary restrictions in their own in-
terests ! If they were incurables no one
would mind them having a short and merry
time of it; but hopeless cases are sent to
the Austin Hospital, where they lead a
much quieter life. Most of the patients at
Mont Park with six months’ careful treat-
ment would be well on the way to health.
The present methods mean death or relapse
to the sufferers and menace, to the public,
while the expenditure, judging by results,
is a shocking waste of money.

SUBJECT: TREATMENT OF MEN SUFFERING
FROM PHTHISIS —MONT PARK SANATORIUM
ARTICLE SUBMITTED BY The Bulletin.
“A few cases of irregular conduct have occurred
amongst the patients at Mont Park Sanatorium. The
statements made in the article are grossly exag-
gerated.
“It must be remembered that most of these men
have been discharged from the Service, and, there-
fore, cannot be brought under the regular military
discipline.
“When a discharged man does not prove amenable
to the proper control demanded by his physical con- •
dition and Avill not obey the orders of those responsi-
ble for his welfare, he can only be discharged from
the Institution. This action is taken whenever neces-
sary, but in the best interests of the men themselves,
it is only done as a last resource, because undoubt-
edly such cases will usually be placed in a much
worse position as regards their prospects of recovery
when left to their own devices, than when retained
in the Sanatorium.”

It seems pretty hopeless, this attempt to get
the opinion of the people upon any given
subject. A general election can’t do it, of
course; and under present conditions a
referendum isn’t much better. For in-
stance, Australia tried the other day to get
the verdict of the country on Conscription;
and since then The Bulletin has been
endeavoring to find out why various people
voted as thev did. And this is a character-
istic letter on the subject:—
As a reader for the past 20 years I thought it
might be interesting for you to know why I voted
No. 1 am in the three-ball business in this city
[Adelaide]. A few weeks after the war started the
Commonwealth Government announced that all who
owed money to people ip the same line of business
as myself and went into camp would be relieved of
their obligation to pay. Naturally that regulation
taken advantage of, and when we made applica-
tion for payment we were told to go to . Over
that we lost hundreds of pounds. One case: I lent a
man £B5. He paid off £lO. War broke out. An
English reservist, he enlisted. He is still here, and
has never been away. He is a staff sergeant-major
earning 14s. daily, but I have never had a penny
piece from him for 3% years. Principal security,
motor-car. Puzzle now, find the car.
A few months after the war started I awoke one
morning to find that a civilian moratorium had also
sprung into existence, compelling us to g;et consent
of court before taking possession of our security.
More people defied us. I went to law with one who
owed us £24, and had not paid anything for 18
months. We won the day, of course, got a verdict
(without costs). It left us £9 9s. out of pocket.
Most of the customers who take advantage of the
moratorium were never so well off in their lives
before. What, then, becomes of me? The bank calls
up its overdraft. Every penny I can get in goes
out that way. No moratorium for me, no nothing!
So another vote —probably Rebecca’s vote
as well as Abraham’s —went against Con-
sciiption, though, frankly, Abraham didn’t
consider the merits of compulsory versus
voluntary service at all. It becomes more
and more evident that, while democratic
sentiment insists upon the free use of the
referendum, safety and commonsense equally
insist upon a strenuous effort at the politi-
cal education of those who are to do the
voting.
Mitchell, the Adelaide S.M., declared the
other day that there wasn’t a man living
who knew all the War Precaution regula-
tions. Yet besides those regulations the
newspaper is supposed to know about 5000
Censorship instructions, which have been
dribbling in ever since the war started. Ot
course nine-tenths of them are most of the
time in tho dust-bin. If they were not, our
esteemed contemporary The Hen is about
the only paper that wouldn’t be liable to
have half its matter thrown out. And
even The Hen would have to be careful.
An announcement that eggs are plentiful at
Warwick (Q.) might be construed as preju-
dicial to recruiting in that district. More
idiotic things have happened. A paper was
warned once, for instance, not to make
the Fat man so fat and contented. It was
prejudicial to recruiting.
Nobody ever poked into the affairs of the
Defence Department without holding his
nose as he came away. Auditor-General
Israel is the latest. In his 1916-17 report
he mentions, among other things, a trifle of
£177,391 alleged to have bifcn paid to sol-
diers, but for which there are no vouchers.
In the Ordnance branch the stock sheets are
not worth the paper they are written on ;
and in Queensland stock has not been taken
since the beginning of the war. Naturally,
with business run on these lines, “receipt
vouchers are defective and serious irregu-
larities with regard to the issue of cloth and
other stores were disclosed.” Still, Par-
liament assumes that it would be a
national calamity if the men who are Min-
isterially responsible for this state of things
were superseded. So does the Argus. So
does the S. M. Herald. Presumably they
approve of this state of things.

A delicate fantasy is “The Willow Tree,”
presented at Sydney Criterion last Saturday.
The plot is slight, being merely the incar-
nation of an ancient legend of Japan. An
Englishman lapses to Japanese ways and
thought, living as a Japanese, and writing
poems to the rain-god. So occupied he falls in
love with a life-size image of a tree-spirit of
olden time, buys it from the ancient image-
maker, and places a mirror in the wooden
doll’s bosom. Naturally the image awakens
to life, and her charm infatuates the Eng-
lishman. But there is an English girl in
the background, and she arrives at the Gar-
den of Happiness. Just then comes the call
of the war. But the Englishman cannot
give up his princess. She, however, learn-
ing that his love for hej.’ is holding him back
from his duty, saves him from himself by
deliberately renouncing her brief life; and
as the willow-tree, of which she was the
spirit, is cut down by her orders, she sinks
back into the wooden effigy carved by the
old image-maker. The fantasy depends
solely on the beauty of its idea and upon the
atmosphere. Since the whole story takes
place within a tiny, one-apartment Jap-
anese garden house, there is little room for
action: the romance is practically static.
This effect —a legitimate effect in drama,
provided that it is sustained by the statu-
esque poses of the actors and the atmosphere
of unreality—is heightened by the fact that
the image even on awakening to life remains
fettered in her movements by the costume
and ceromonial of old Japan, and even at
her pathetic gayest is restrained by her
ghostly inheritance of immobility. Even
the man cannot break that calm, for drama
is heavily handicapped when it is horizontal
instead of perpendicular. The most impres-
sive moments pass while the two recline on
mats on the floor. And in the end move-
ment entirely ceases: the girl slowly freezes
back to wood, and the man lies at her feet
as if dead. On Saturday the beautiful stag-
ing and the romantic lighting of the
garden and its tiny house made the difficult
illusion more than possible. The play moved
with a solemn beauty from morning to
moonlight, the little stage in the garden
being thrown into an unearthly prominence
—a beautiful Maeterlinck effect. The only
jarring note was the unlikeness of the prin-
cess to her image. Even the image’s hair
was done in a different fashion.
With one exception the play was excel-
lently cast. Evidently there are two George
Barnums: the efficient producer and the

focussed. Kathlene Macdonell adds another

coyness, her quick tempers, and her naive
sincerity are exquisitely suggested. The
rather too modern humor with which the
fantasy is peppered falls without offence
from her lips. It happens that this actress
has also to take the part of the downright
English girl, her rival for the man’s love;
and Miss Macdonell’s versatility is easily
equal to the task.
To an audience deliberately trained by the
Firm to appreciate Broadway humor and
dollardrama, fed for years on an unvarying
diet of crook-plays, this quaintly beautiful
fantasy came naturally as a surprise. The
audience, especially the gallery-girl part of
it, found the transition from crookdom _to
delicate romance too much for its equili-
brium : and Kathlene Macdonell had to pay
for the Firm’s past foolishness. It was too
much to expect a whole holiday audi-
ence to get immediately into the neces-
sary mood ; and titters in the wrong place
led at last to an interruption which was too
much for the star. She flung down the
mirror she was carrying and fled from the
stage. Thus the curtain fell on the play
unfinished. The American crook-plavs had
come home to roost. On Monday evening
the widespread sympathy for an actressj
whose long season
in Australia has
allowed her no
holiday, and whose
versatility has im-
posed a tremendous
strain on her
health, resulted in
a crowded house.
From the rise of
the curtain to its
fall the play was
witnessed with ap-
preciation ; there
was never a hint
of disapproval, not
a solitary giggle in
the wrong place;
and at the conclu-
sion of each act

was only a hint of weariness in the actress’s
face that made the house desist from express-
ing its sympathy and appreciation. By the
fiasco on Saturday evening the audience
missed seeing the fascinating artistry with
which the actress, as the Princess, faded, as
it seemed, into the immobility of the wooden
image. “The Willow Tree” is for a dis-
criminating audience; but how large that
audience is in Sydney is for the Firm, after
so many years of crook-drama, to discover.

“The Bing Boys,” at Sydney Majesty’s,

“Parentage,” which is now enticing the
sentimental type of citizen and citizeness
to Sydney Royal with the promise “It will
stain your cheeks with tears,” is true to its
dismal word. It is built on the plan of the
old temperance chart which showed two
equally nice infants, and then contrasted
them, stage by stage, until one had developed
into a bleak, side-whiskered wowser of
purest ray serene and the other was a cheery,
beery ruin. A comedy film helps the long-
drawn sermon out, and the Australian toni-
cal pictures are interesting.

tone Peter Dawson, and the managerial ad.

turn, the Creole Fashion Plate and eomedi-
onne Etnel Vaugn fill in the rest of the
evening.

“Hashimura Togo,” a story based on the
Japanese conception of honor, holds pride
of place at Hoyt’s and the Haymarket in
Sydney. Sessue Hayakawa makes Togo a
convincing and attractive character. Added
to the exquisite Japanese settings and the
quaintly-phrased sub-titles is an all-round
excellent production.
Dorothy Kelly and Montagu Love make a
big appeal from the Crystal Palace screen.
As Marguerite and Jacoues they find and
nearly lose love again amid the color-tubes
and brushes of the Latin Quarter. How
the fair canvas of their romance escapes
smudging-out by the villain makes an effec-
tual and human story ; and for the rest of
the week Jack Livingston goes through
seven reels of adventure at the btrand
‘‘Because of a Woman.”
“Winnie Brooke, Widow,” the little musi-
cal comedy that Ada Reeve brought to Mel-
bourne Tivoli last Saturday, seems all the
more a success because it finishes with a fast
run after a somewhat sedate beginning. The
comedy has a plot from which there are no
wild departures —a plot founded on Ada’s
sweA resolve to burst up a mock-monastic
brotherhood” at Dunfield’s Priory, with a
view to marrying the celibate brother-in-
chief. The fact that two young girls of her
acquaintance are pining for minor members
of the futile brotherhood broadens the in-
terest in her matrimonial designs on the
establishment. “Winnie Brooke, Widow,”
is, in fact, a light and frivolous suggestion
of Glory Quayle planning to lure John Storm
from his “monkery” and make a harmless
man-of-the-world of him. To which extent
it confirms tliis writer in his suspicion that
somebody ought to get hold of Hall Caine
and turn him into a musical-comedy satirist
of his own gloomy melodramas ere he dies.
Nothing that happens in this whimsical
comedy is irrelevant to the simple narrative.
The musical items are incidental, rather than
accidental, to the dialogue, and the dances
are legitimately related to it. Also, the
characters are fitted to the co. The per-
formance is good stuff quite apart from the
re-introduction of some of the popular ditties
that Miss Reeve and Talleur Andrews in-
cluded in their vaudeville programme of
vore. Their duet towards the end of the
show is charming • all the concerted pieces
that occur thereabouts are catchy and full
of go, and the finale is a happy idea.
* * * *
Ada Reeve’s way of managing the affair
is inimitable, of course. An artist in all she
does, she has the rare knack of carrying her
audience with her all the time. She
naturalises the proceedings. She lends im-
portance to Clarence Blakiston (who can’t
sing or dance w r orth tuppence) because he is
supposed to be the cranky object of her
affections, and she gives an air of reality to
other people’s love-affairs which might be
profoundly unconvincing if she were not
there. Talleur Andrews walks easily
through the part of a solicitor, Ashton Jarry
and Jacobs are two lovesick novices from the
wondrous monkery, Allen and Miss De Lara
are an all-right couple of grotesque wowsers,
and Charles Albert and Lucie Linda are
distinctly valuable as a pair of humorous
menials who can dance. Everybody already
knows that Albert can be funny, but the
low-comedy talent of Lucie Linda comes as a
joyful surprise. A limited chorus does its
bit neatly, and is remarkable for never being
allowed to sing out of its turn. The chorus
in most musical comedies seems to come on
and sing whenever it likes.

At Melbourne Princess’s the Prince of
Sax-Steinberg (who is Wilkie in drunk’s
clothing) continues to swank into the toy
kingdom of Lividia, and demand the hand of
Princess Marie Ney in unholy matrimony.
Prince Edwards of Calvaria continues to
thwart his puvpose, but whether the three
Kingdoms mentioned call out their respective
invisible armies and fight to a finish is not
stated in the drama. Probably they go to
war and all the dynasties are obliterated b.v
Bolshevik revolutions, or they perish of food-
shortage. Anyhow, the play is called “The
Lifeguardsman,” and it will be performed as
before until further notice.
** * *
“Whittington,” at Her Majesty’s, is still
resisting the temptations to turn back to
London and be beguiled by Maggie Dickin-
son. The exact nature of the temptations is
still open to argument. They either come to
the young man in a dream, or else Arch-
Fiend Arnold conjures up visions of fair
women for Whittington’s undoing. In
neither case can the temptations be very
strong, seeing that the principal boy is a girl
to whom the glad eyes of the syrens will
hardly appeal.
“Aladdin,” too, is sticking to business at
Melbourne King’s. Here they have a harle-
quinade at the matinees, and the clown’s
awful thefts of meat from the butcher remind
one that clowns can hardly be doing the
same old felony in London just now. The
joke would be too cruel —even in panto.

At Melbourne Royal comes a change of bill
on Saturday. “The Easiest Way” displaces
the “Bird of Paradise.” Muriel Starr
appears as tlie New York stage-lady who
chooses the easiest way, and the public has
sad misgivings that the way in question is
something young women are expected to feel
sorry for afterwards —especially in drama.
An emotional actress is rarely permitted to
sin with impunity unless the other culprit is
a king, as in Nell Gwynne’s case.

People are getting an unauthoritative
view of the war through the lens of the
Vitagraph camera at Melbourne Majestic
this week. The story is ■ entitled “For
France,” and is a study of that Yankee
heroism which grows towards invincibility
as the opposition increases. The valiant
Sammy in this fable makes a large Hun
regiment look like an epidemic of infantile
paralysis. “The Stainless Barrier,” also at
the Majestic, is about that “Southern
pride” which is one of the principal raw
materials of the American movie industry.
The Southerners in the present effusion
possess so much pride that they swallow a
lot of it when there is nothing else avail-
able. One of them also swallows his honor
and his sister's and smudges a family record
about 1000 years long.

Hoyt’s Melbourne supporters had their
first glimpse of the Jap screen actor, Sessue
Ilayakawa, on Saturday. Sessue floats
into the film, “Hashimura Togo,” and makes
a valid claim for the front place in a
dramatic equipment that suits the Japan-
easiness of the story. , Sessue does not
belong to the gesticulatory Yankee school.
He acts with his eyes and a half-size smile;
when he uses his hands he does it daintily,
as if he were fingering porcelain. Fanny
Ward idles away the time of a tame ten-
derfoot in the extra feature, “On the Level.”
Fan is the giggling Western heroine who
has to prove to the hero’s ma that some-
times all is gold that titters.
Samuel Houston, who carried a gun for
the Stars and Stripes in Texas and else-
where. is the photographer’s darling in the
Fox film called “The Conqueror,” at Mel-
bourne Auditorium. The picture fills in
gaps in Samuel’s history with fictitious par-
ticulars and credits his success to the
impetus of an amorous feeling. Eliza Allen,
the damsel whom he originally married and

MELBOURNE ROYAL.

left within three months, appears intermit-
tently on the screen as a banal blonde who
goads the hero to celebrity with her scorn-
ful laughter. The second part of the yarn
is mostly devoted to Samuel’s struggle with
a crudely-manufactured villain for a life-
interest in Eliza. Samuel has to shoot his
way to the lady, and here and there leaves
a doubt whether he can reach his objective
before his ammunition gives out.
The clever, all-round Anderson Co., which
has been playing melodrama of various quali-
ties at Adelaide Tivoli for over a year, is
going to take a spell and make room for
pantomime. Its closing effort is “For a
Child’s Sake,” which gives a good chance to
the clever young Gladys Gaul. The Royal
gets in first with a panto, on the screen—
with a real giant and hundreds of kiddies
enjoying themselves. A line and exciting
turn is that of Delmore and Lee at the
Majestic. They have moved on now, and
Ruth Budd is in their place; there’s a good
supporting co. —notably Percival in his
plain and fancy work on the piano. Roast-
ing weather has given a great chance to the
English Pierrots at the Exhibition Garden,
all rivalry of a similar kind being now at
an end. Elsa Langley is a pleasant circum-
stance, and the old St. Ivilda (Vic.) favor-
ites are winning a steady public in Adelaide,
too. Pictures are many and good. At
West’s, the bedroom door is smashed nightly
in "Bought and Paid For,” and at Wonder-
graph Douglas Fairbanks teaches a crowd of
formerly useless peop.e to live the Simple
Life.
“D.F.” : The wonderful story of the suc-
cessful operation—a world’s record in long-
distance surgery—which Dr. Holland of
Perth carried out by telegraph with the
patient at Hall’s Creek, near the border of
the Northern Territory, over 1500 miles
away, had a tragic sequel. After the post-
master at Hall’s Creek had carried out the
delicate and difficult operation under the
doctor’s telegraphed instructions, the pati-
ent’s brothers telegraphed to Dr. Holland
offering him a fee of £3OO to come up ana
see the case through. The doctor took the
boat to Derby and then started out in a
buckboard to meet someone who went down
from Hall’s Creek with horses. The man
who was to meet him camped too soon, and
there was some delay, with the result that
when Dr. Holland got to Hall’s Creek the
patient had been dead six hours. It wasn’t
anything to do with the operation that
killed him, though, but a severe attack of
malaria.
From the Gallery:—
Customs Minister Jensen is naturally annoyed at
having his motah expenses questioned. And when
you realise Jensen’s enormous services to the Empiah,
it really does seem ungrateful to deny him a few
hundreds for a limousine and etceteras. Indeed,
recognising that Parliamentary privilege is so vast
and the cashbox so easy, one ought to be delighted
with his moderation. But Jensen’s case is not pecu-
liar. He is only one out of 111 who endure the
painful perquisites of their position with stoical
suffering. The Commonwealth, which crowds £6OO
a year into their unwilling paws, tries to destroy
their independence with a free library, free billiards,
free games and free travelling. They are also
threatened with free food; but the fact that the
refreshment-room has been run at a loss of a mere
£lOOO a year show's that the threat hasn’t been
carried into full effect. As for the travelling, every
member and his family is condemned to immunity
from rail fares all over the Commonwealth. The
other day a member who is barely kept from the
brink of starvation by several thousands p.a. found
things so arranged that he and his human belongings
were, for all practical purposes, overlooked by the
ticket-collectors between Melbourne and Sydney. No
doubt this freedom from trouble in travelling, which
has been devised to prevent small worries annoying
minds full of Empiah problems, makes members
careless about the limits of their charitable relief.
The consequence is that they develop lifelong attach-
ments for soap, nail and hat brushes, boot blacking,
stationery, O.S. stamps and other trifles provided for
their convenience. There is now a movement on
foot to furnish free groceries, free vegetables, boots
and cloches for each M.P. Considering that almost
everything else is on the free list, the omission of
those items seems a rank injustice.
“GGG”: Anyone know why returned Bill-
jims refuse to light three men’s cigarettes
with the one match? I recently asked
several, but none was able to give me a
satisfying answer. One mentioned that it
was a recognised superstition among the
Aussies that the third man would find a
bullet.
From the Gallery :—•
The spectacle of William Irvine sitting in isola-
tion in a corner of the Heps, is an indication of his
unyielding attitude to the force of circumstances.
If Iceberg would only suspend his talk about Con-
scription and settle down to be a “good party man,
he might be allowed to contribute the force of his
intelligence to the Cabinet’s exclusive job of Win-
ning the War. But lrVine stays in his little corner
and looks down from the Himalayan altitude of a
“safe seat” on- those who are not so fortunately
circumstanced. Junker-like in his contempt for the
popular vote, his obstinacy on the question is either
tenacity or stupidity, according to your fueling for
the man; but there is no doubt that it is hardening
the personal hostility towards him without serving
any good purpose. When Maxwell, M.11.R., turns on
his legal brother with the straight tip to bury the
subject, one can see Iceberg losing his deposit in a
Popularity Contest. If he persists in calling for
Compulsion, there will surely be a free fight, and
the frozen dignity that has endured for 20 years
will suddenly disappear in a flood of boiling language.
Once or twice lately I have suspected that he was
very nearly losing his temper. We have seen him
grow pinker and pinker under Opposition attacks,
, and up here we have started to wonder how pink he
can get without exploding.

"one should always keep one’s powder dry.”
“True; but I believe in a fresh application
after each engagement.”
Queensland was busy last week doing
things which, so far as preliminary evi-
dence goes, will make the best previous
known deluge blush with shame on a back
seat. The evidence is scrappy as yet, for
telegraphs and telephones and railways are
crippled, and towns are cut off, and Mackay
is a sodden ruin, and isolated stations and
farms and hamlets will be a long time before
they send in their list of dead. As for the
solitary nomad w r ho was overtaken on the
track, he won’t send in any list, and pro-
bably the sludge will get his bones and keep
them. But a flood in Queensland leaves
behind it something besides sludge. In
addition to innumerable records of unobtru-
sive heroism the debris is glided with lavish
subscriptions for the homeless; for they are
a generous lot in the Land of Big Things,
and even such stodgy folk as “our respected
fellow townsman” and “a widely-esteemed
resident” do good deeds which almost excuse
their existence. The bush concert blows
forth much music in the good cause, and
the thud of boots at the charitable dance is
loud in the land. Then the broken bridges
are repaired and the surface of things be-
comes a brighter green, and the grass in
the main street of Port Douglas grows so
high that a small horse is liable to suffocate
amid the foliage. And Queensland presently
goes on its way rejoicing as a good, stalwart
white man in the tropics is always liable to
do.

The padre vouches for this yarn:—
I was cycling through the dark from Poperinghe
to Ypres when an obstruction in the middle of the
road blocked me. Blessed if it wasn’t one of our
heavy guns on a traction wagg;on, and not a soul
near it save myself. ’Twas a mystery to me, and I
went on wondering what part in the scheme of things
that big lone gun was destined to play. I’d pedalled
about three miles further when I heard the rumble
of a big traction-engine in front. I ranged along-
side and hailed the driver and his mate. “What’s
up?” said the driver. “Have a look behind,” T
chuckled. Bill looked back and then hopped down.
For a full minute he gazed in wonderment. Then
lie turned and shouted to his mate: “.Jim, me
if we ain’t gone an’ lost the —-- gun!”

A snort from France: —
I see that back home in Australia the defenders of
machine-militarism have been explaining that it is
the uniform that the soldier salutes, not the man.
You can tell ’em from" me tha,t that is rot.
We’ve got to salute the man even if he’s in pyjamas.
“Try Fluke”; Russell, Bay of Islands
(M.L.), scared itself into a panic when it
got news of the bolt of the German prisoners
from Motuihi Island. One of the boss bum-
bles of the old township, imagining that the
Huns were sure to call and turn the place into
a second Belgium (with a special eye to the
women), established a system of patrols and
refuge-places in the scrub. The dread alarum
was given at two o’clock one morning, and
the whole female population rose from its
blankets as one woman and made tracks for
the tall tea-tree. It was a wet morning, and
there weren’t many dry nighties when the
ladies were tracked to their lairs and led
shivering home to breakfast. It was a fish-
ing-boat coming home from the hapuka
grounds!
“Pull-through”: There is an estimable
sergeant-major, one of the good old bulldog
sort, in a M.L. camp, who has his troubles
in the matter of the letter aitch. At the
morning drill he called out the raw non-coms,
in turn to put the company through. There
must have been a ’orrible conspiracy afoot,
for one after another of the budding ser-
geants laid special emphasis on the “ ’Alt.”
The instructor dropped to the game in a
jiffy. “Look ’ere,” he said ferociously,
“there’s only two men in the regiment who’re
allowed to say ‘ ’Alt!’ One’s the Colonel, the
other’s me. All the others when they want
to say ‘ ’Alt’ must say ‘ ’Alt!’ with a haitch.
“Kola” : A few weeks ago a small army of
blacks, under a smart half-
caste, had the job of putting
up a big set of stockyards for a
station beyond Meekatharra
(W.A.). They finished the job
and were paid. Then they had
a confab as how to spend the
money. As a result the whole
tribe, men, women and kids,
trooped down to Meekatharra.
But not to the pub. Instead,
they called on the local motor-
garage boss, hired his cars, and
for the next w T eek Meekatharra
had the joy of seeing loads of
assorted nigger scooting over
the landscape. The women and
kids seemed to enjoy the fun
best, and the way they squealed
at a sharp turn was something
to be remembered. When the money gave
out a band of blacks, penniless but happy,
took the road to the bush again.
He had shyly dropped in at the office pass-
ing through to the Front, and when he got
there he reported progress:—
I’m doin’ well so fur. Rains have bin interfering
a good deal with the war lately. I haven’t put in
full time one week since I bin here, but it don’t
matter—they don’t stop nothin’ off, no matter how
much you don’t work. This is the only job I’ve had
where they don’t take time off fur wet wether. All
the same, they’d save a lot on this war if they let it
out on contrack.
A MATTER OF THE MOMENT.
THE BOY : “We’ve been engaged fully ten minutes, and you haven’t let me hiss you
yet.”
THE GIRL : “Oh, I'm afraid if I did that you would think that I—that I meant it.”
“Tourniquet”: There is fine dignity in a
letter written to the Melbourne press by
Ilobert O. Tucker, of Belgrave, who uses the
death from overwork of his daughter, Nurse
Hazel Tucker, as a plea to the Melbourne
Hospital committee to lighten the duties of
its nursing staff. Someone wrote to The
Bulletin the other week pointing out that
the Royal Red Cross was an inadequate
reward for the nurse whose life is broken
on the edge of the battlefield. But what of
the nurse in a civil hospital who has not
even the hope of a Red Cross to decorate
her tombstone? Tucker has the support of
medical men in his contention that the
present four years’ course is not necessary
for effective training, and that it is cruel
to compel girls to rise at 5.30 a.m. and
w T ork 10 hours a day at high speed, often
without reasonable time for meals. His
daughter was admittedly a most efficient
nurse. She started her training in January,
1914, and began to break dowm early in her.
fourth year. She refused to ask for sick-
leave, however, being eager to finish her
training. Six weeks before she died, a ton-
silitis operation was followed by vomiting
and hemorrhage. Seven days later she was
sent home with myocarditis. She was
ordered to rest, and to report to the hospital
in a fortnight for medical examination. She
was in bed almost throughout her leave.
When she reported herself she was not
examined, and was sent on duty at six o’clock
next morning. That evening she broke down,
and nine days later she was dead. Those
who saw her die consider that her father has
made out a case which demands an answer.
And every nurse who knew she was dying,
and watched the plucky fight she made, is
waiting to hear w r hat answ r er the Melbourne
Hospital committee can give.
Truth can still give fiction a few' points.
Eric Crofts was a Dunedin medical student
when the war broke out, but a month ago
he was Captain Crofts, twice wounded, and
wearing the Military Cross. Also, he was
engaged to marry Miss Jardine, daughter of
Jardine, M.P., owner or iron-mines and
things. His career had been a sufficient
plot for a sentimental novel up to the even-
ing before the dav fixed for his marriage in
London. The novelist would, of course, ring
in a rival suitor possessed of all the virtues
save heroism, and this poor fellow' would be
eating his heart out. But even the novelist
would jib at the suggestion of bringing the
hero to a violent death on the eve of his in-
tended marriage. Fate didn’t jib, though.
It simply collared young Crofts, threw him
down a staircase and fractured his skull.
“Jim Carew”: One of our Gippo inter-
preters having outstayed his leave was
written to officially, and this was his reply :
My absence is impossible. Someone has removed
my wife. My God, I am annoyed.
It doesn’t take much to irk some of these
natives.
* * * *
There is a professional man who gave up
a couple of thousand a year to go into camp
well over six months ago and is there still.
“Well, what have you learned. ’ he was
asked the other day. He thought a moment.
Then: “Well, to tell you the truth, nothing
much except how to dress for the job.” It
recalls the story told in “Suvla Bay and
After” of the major who, with buttons,
badges and leggings gleaming out like helio-
graphs in the sun, stood bolt upright on a
knoll with his field-glasses fixed firmly at
his eyes, complaining with bitterness that
“those ruffian Turks were turning out half-
naked to meet the Fusiliers.” The
ruffians now hold Suvla Bay and the major
is dead.
NOT DOING II IS BIT.
HE: “ I— er — say, we can’t all go to the
Front. Some of us fellows must stay at
home, y’know.”
SHE (bored to screams): “Well, that
wouldn’t be so bad—but you don't.”
THE WAR GOES ON.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
“ft is unlikely that any development will follow
for at least a fortnight. Now that the House of
Representatives has disposed of flic business before
it, Ministers intend to take a short rest before seri
ously attacking the politico 1 situation.”
The breeze upon the mountain-top is calling, soft
and low-;
Cool zephyrs from far gullies bid us pack our
bags and go ;
The weary spirit weakens in the battle for the Right,
The soul cries out for something that will help it
in the fight ;
The trout leaps for its breakfast in the sparkling
mountain-stream,
And of baked fish and coffee our drooping patriots
dream —-
Of rest upon the mountain-top, with new-laid eggs
and cream.
The blue sky and the drifting white of downy
clouds that crawl
Above the farthest ranges; ribbon-roads that rise
and fall
Across the summer landscape in the sunshine; and
the rare,
Rich perfume of ripe poultry in the kitchen, roast-
ing there—
These are kind Nature’s tonics for the one with
faltering feet:
A green and grateful pleasaunce where square meals
and Nature meet;
Blue, peaceful skies and gracious bush and stacks
of things to eat.
The fragrance of the blooming gums is like a voice
afar
That bids the glum, down-hearted one gets out his
motor-car,
Leaving the cares of office to the office-boy, and take
The old bush-track once more, to loaf for his dear
country’s sake;
To rot around awhile and view some fair and placid
scene
Where he may find the means to keep his wits and
courage keen,
With snoozes underneath the gums and snacklets in
between.
Yet all the while the blessed war goes on, alacka-
day!
And hour by hour good mates o’ mine proceed upon
their way
To death and glory, scars and slush, chill nights
and roaring morns,
While in Australia’s cool retreats her saviors rest
their corns
And give their brains a holiday. Ye patriots,
hearken where
The nation’s voice, or some of it, speaks from an
easy-chair
Upon the grass, whereon reclines a figure pale and
wan;
“Ah, yes, the war goes on! Alas, this awful war
goes on !....
Well, yes, just half a cup this time —and one more
buttered scone.”
VICTORIA.

The 500 free insurance policies for £2OO
each offered by Sam McGaughey to recruits
have now all been taken up. Over 90 per-
cent. of the applications came from married
men, and 1500 dependents are getting a little
extra shelter under the scheme, which is
costing £2O per policy per annum. Two of
the insured soldiers (both of them married)
died before they climbed aboard the trans-
port, and the benefits come tyj their people.
About 30 applications froui married men
arrived too late, and the N.S.W. Public
Trustee is listening for the footstep of

“Murknh”: For the fourth time within
10 months the futility of the postal registra-
tion scheme has been advertised by a big
loss —£1000 worth of banknotes this time.
The fact that the Department has no idea
where the parcel of notes disappeared and
doesn’t even know that it left Sydney is
proof of the rottenness of the system. The
registered articles for (say) Brewarrina are
slung into a. bag in Sydney mail-room and
PLENTY THERE.
THE BLOKE: “ They’ve all got so bloomin’
tame since the war that there’s nowhere
a bloke can find a bit of excitement on
Sunday afternoons now."
THE DEAR THING: “Oh, yes, there is. They
don’t stop fighting on Sundays, you
know."
enclosed in another bag containing the ordi-
nary mail. Both bags are sealed. There-
after, from Sydney to Brewarrina, the vari-
ous officials merely sign for a bag, without
reference to, or inspection of, tne contents.
That the point of loss is not even approxi-
mately known can thus be easily understood.
The seals afford no protection. The wax is
so brittle that a broken seal never excites
suspicion. In any case, the mark left by
a shilling is plenty near enough to pass
the. casual inspection of a straw official or
mail-contractor. The old registration-of-
contents plan with a chain of signatures is
urgently needed. Under this method the
clerks accepting letters from the public
examined the innards and issued a receipt
therefor. The nature of the contents was
marked on the envelope, which was then
scaled. Thereafter each man in the chain
signed for the articles themselves instead of,
as at present, for mere bags, the contents
of which are not even specified and into
which the articles may never have been put
The present method merely provides a heavy
fog (in this instance: 518 miles long) for the
detectives to lose themselves in.
The Melbourne Age has been making
allegations about the use of publicly-owned
motor-cars by certain Federal Ministers and
their female belongings for wholly private
purposes. It may be difficult to make out
a case against a Minister except jn very-
glaring instances, for when he goes joy-
riding in the nation’s vehicle he can at
least allege that he took his documents with
him. and bent his_ gigantic intellect on
public affairs while" speeding through the
scenery. But if it is true that the contrap-
tions which the nation pays for are used by
Ministerial wives .or sisters or cousins or
aunts or flappers to go shopping in. there
ought to be a plain case against the ladies for
misappropriation of petrol. Also there is
a law somewhere about using a car without
the permission of its owner. When plain
Bill Smith employs the railways without
authority he is arrested for not paying his way.
and it is called “travelling without a ticket.”
Yet Bill at his worst doesn’t order that a
train shall be brought out at 10.30 exactly
for his convenience, and tell the driver to
take him to Mordialloc or Parramatta and
there await his convenience. He lacks the
splendid effrontery of some people in higher
walks of life, which may be one reason why
he remains Bill to the end of his days. As
for his wife—well, there is many a hard-
worked washerwoman who might be affluent
if she had learned the art of saving her
boots in her youth.
“Bion”: Our sick transport had
some invalids confined to cots. One
was a young Billjim with home
and parents in Melbourne; but to
suit a whim of General Bed Tape
he was being carried on to Syd-
ney. His father, determined to
get aboard and see his boy, in spite
of regulations, borrowed a post-
man’s coat, slung a bag across his
shoulder and carried some enve-
lopes and papers in his hand. When
the first excitement of being along-
side had died down a bit, we
noticed an old postman coming up
the gangway. He casually nodded
to the watchman, then to the
guard, and made his way on deck.
When in a safe quarter, he sought
his son’s whereabouts. Luckily he
struck somebody who knew and
who guided him to the bedside.
There was a gale of laughter and
cheering when the joke flew round,
and the send-off the “postman” got
when he decided to return home

His friends had been writing dolefully;

Kenneth H. Brock, erstwhile mercantile
broker in Melbourne, in these days 0.0. a
trench-mortar battery :
We have never been afraid of Fritz, man for man.
All we wanted was artillery, and at last we have it.
Things like this happen now. Within the area of
our first objective at Polygon Wood was a sandy
mound giving command of all the country round for
some thousands of yaj’ds. This was immediately
seized by our people for an O.P. for artillery and
machine-guns. I had the pleasure of being there
when the troops for the main counter-attack were
endeavoring to form up about 1000 yards away. They
never had a dog's chance. The F. 0.0., directing his
batteries from the mound, poured salvo after salvo
into the assembling troops. The machine-gunners
had the target of their lives. In the excitement of
the moment, I wished I was a machine-gunner
myself as they sat behind (irony of Fate!) captured
German guns and literally mowed down the grey
masses. The attack, needless to say, never developed.
Those who escaped the artillery were caught by our
rifle and machine-gun fire. Fritz's casualties must
have been enormous.
None of us look forward to the winter with
great joy. We will, however, endure it as we have
done before, but now with a certain moral superi-
ority, derived from the occupation of positions and
certain high ground, intended by the Boche for his
winter quarters.
The game is not won yet, but we are bn the
winning side. We know it, every man, from the
General to the humblest private. So cheero, Australia !
“Billy T.”: My friend Carmichael, being ;i

He does not run it particularly well, but be

day he was called to a case, and as there
was some danger of the patient getting well,
time was the essence of the contract. Dr.
Carmichael drove hard, and feeling a bump
of unusual assertiveness looked back long
enough to discover a dog in his last agonies
on the road, and a person with red whiskers
and his braces suspended starting out of a
doorway with the air of a man who means
business. With his patient at health’s door,

“Cudgewa”: “F.C.” (B. 10/1/18) refers
to lodge doctors and their charges for opera-
tions; but at present I’m more concerned
with a Pills who is unfettered by lodge laws
and his staggering mileage charges. In a
recent case in my own home, calculations

went astray, and the little Austialian was
signalled some weeks ahead of schedule. Ihe
Bush Nurse was tim-
ing her holidays in
order to be present for
his reception, so Pills
had to be called by
’phone from his den,
32 miles away. He
arrived promptly, and
everything passed off
happily, until I asked
for the Stork’s bill.
Pills: “Sixteen guin-
eas.” “Cripes!” I
gasped. “Hot, isn’t
it!” “Not at all,” he
assured me. “We
usually get half a
guinea a mile for these
cases.” Now. any
garage, anywhere in
Australia, will take
anyone anywhere, any
distance, and at any
hour of the day or
night, for one shilling
per mile. Does the
B.M.A. value the
touring time of its
members at 9s. 6d. per
mile (roughly, two
minutes by motor) ?
By the time the mid-
wife was paid I had
parted with rather
more than “F.C.’s”
estimate of £2O. I’m
working overtime now
trying to patch up that hole in my slender
banking account, and viciously cursing the

“Wart”: Launceston is losing its queer
old Cataract mill chutes, which cling to the
rocks on 'the side of the Cataract Gorge. In
the old days the mill was driven by a
picturesque overshot wheel, but about 20
years ago this was replaced by turbines:
now they give place to the electric motor.
For a generation the chutes were all that
Launceston had to depend on for fresh
water. Wooden pipes carried the liquid to
elevated tanks, and water-carts used to back
under and obtain a fill for a shilling. The
mill itself w r as built by Andrew Sibbald. His
tombstone, which is still to be seen in the
Presbyterian cemetery in High-street, has
this quaint inscription:—-
Sacred to the memory of Andrew Sibbald, miller,
who departed this life 19th of March, 1842, aged 45
years. This inscription is intended to perpetuate the
memory of his valuable services to the inhabitants
of Launceston, having, after a period of two years,
accomplished the arduous undertaking of erecting the
trough which conveys the pure water to the tanks
and now supplies the town. What was he? He was
a man and what a man should be.
No man could be more, could he?
The members of the Australian Women’s
Service Corps in Sydney considered last
week how they could do honor to Billjim
returned. They decided, after meditation,
that they could not very well do it by taking
off their hats, because that would necessitate
halting the soldier while the hatpins were
drawn. Also they didn’t feel equal to throw-
ing. Bill the glad eye, because that might be
“misconstrued”; and they guessed a plain
military salute would get them rushed into
Callan Park. The idea of standing still as
the wounded hero passed was mooted but
was viewed as impracticable in a place
where everybody is in a hurry and walks on

the wrong side of the footpath. Really, when
you come to think of it, there seems no
alternative but to do something practical for
Bill. If they have any glad-eye to spare the
members can also throw it in an unofficial
capacity, so to speak. William might, in
fact, like it better that way.
FOUR ROADS.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
There runs a road in Flanders
Through meadows to the sea,
A long white road, a good straight road,
As all the world may see.
There runs a road in Flanders
Made dusty by men's feet,
And tramp of marching' soldiers
Rings through the noontide heat.
There runs a road in Flanders,
A broken thing of mud,
Where holes yawn wide and cannot hide
The dull red slime of blood.
There runs a road in Flanders,
And long and straight it goes,
A great white path of glory—
How great, the whole world knows.

s - A. Pethebridge, the Queensland-born
Administrator of German New Guinea, died
in Melbourne last week of malaria, aggra-
vated probably by cigarettes. His father
was formerly Inspector of Works in Queens-
land ; and h£ himself got into the Common-
wealth public service via the Queensland
Marine Board and the Queensland Naval
Brigade; he was secretary .to one and com-
mander of the other. The Bulletin knew
him as an ardent Australian and a fine jour-
nalist wasted.
Bigjohn Forrest was electioneering in the
West. Ilis wife was pushing the barrow for
the old man before a meeting of females,
and John, overcome by the weather, slum-
bered peacefully in a chair on the platform,
“fie said,” exclaimed the dame, dwelling on
the apathy of the woman-voter in the electo-
rate, “that you were made of wood.” The
sleeping statesman awoke with a start.
“What did you say, Margaret?” “I was
tolling them that when you came home after
addressing the ladies’ meeting here previ-
ously you said they were made of wood.”
“Never said anything of the sort,” growled
John, full of confusion. But his better half
persisted and the candidate subsided until
the feminines hilariously dispersed to spread
the joke. The Bulletin doesn’t’ know what
happened after that.
“The Oldest Inhabitant” discovers the
Oldest Water-waggoner:—
The Rev. AV. P. Crook, of the Congregational
church, whose portrait is in the Mitchell Gallery,
founded in Australia the first temperance society.
Crook was one of the original missionaries to
Tahiti, 1796, and is described later as a “gentle-
man s servant.*’ He got back to England somehow
and reappeared on the Australian coast as chaplain
or schoolmaster to the Collins expedition, which
rested awhile at what is now Sorrento, and three
months later sailed across the Bass to found Hobart
Town. He was certainly an itinerant. During the
Johnston-McArthur regime he was appointed chap-
lain and conducted services at old St. Philip’s;
but when Macquarie arrived that potentate refused
to allow him to administer the Sacrament. It was
on September 10, 1832, that he projected the N. S.
AVales Temperance Society. The first public meeting
was held in the house of cabinet-maker Hunt, in
.Tamison-street, premises not long demolished. Chief
•lustice Forbes presided, and Captain Sir Edward
Parry, the Arctic explorer, was one of the speakers.
Crook subsequently went to Port Phillip and died
in 1847. His body is in the Old Cemetery there.
Dead at S 3. Robert Haden Smith, who
came to Victoria 65 years ago and took the

Thomas Williams is entered for the

The death of “Buffalo” Robinson, “King”
of Melville Island (N.T.), brought to light
a chapter of romance in the family history
of the Umphelbys. of Melbourne. Edward
Umphelby came from England to Melbourne
by way of Van Diemen’s Land in 1828,
bought land from John Batman now valued
at £132,000. and in 1838 sold it for a mare
in foal. Then he purchased 7500 sheep and
drove them from Mount Alexander (Vic.)
to Adelaide, a three months’ journey. Part
of the goods he got in payment for the sheep
was the schooner Lulworth, in which he
carried buffaloes from Timor to Port Essing-
ton as food for the mainland military settle-
ment. But a quarrel arose, and he landed one
lot of the animals at Melville Island, where
they bred with the stock originally there, and
years later provided Robinson with his life’s
job.
Lieut. Geake, recently awarded the Order
of the British Empire for carrying out risky
experiments in bomb-making, used to follow
the peaceful Sydney rag-trade for a living.
As a drummer he offset his teetotalism by'
a free distribution of cigars. Later he
became buyer for the mercery department of
a York-street house, but was found to be too
fond of doing what he is now rewarded for,
viz., carrying out risky experiments. He
was always wanting to give new ideas a
chancy Ten years ago a few Sydney firms
pooled £2O find handed him a buying
authority which made a run through the
Cold Co tntry and America possible. This
ended his fluff-trade notions. Coming back
to Australia he drifted into the motor-car
business and finally became, it appears, “con-
sulting enginee-.”

JOEY’S JOB.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
lii days before the trouble Jo was rated as a slob.
He, chose to sit in hourly expectation of a job.
He’d loop hisself upon a post, for seldom friends
had he,
A gift of patient waitin’ his distinctif quality.
He d linger in a doorway, or he'd loiter on the grass,
Hdgin modestly aside to let the fleetin’ moments
pass.
Jo’d beg a bob from mother, but more often got a
clout,
And settled down with cigarettes to smoke the devil
out.
The one consistent member of the Never Trouble
Club,
He put a satin finish on the frontage of the pub.
His shoulder-blades were pokin’ out from polishin’
the pine;
But if a job ran at him Joey’s footwork was divine.
Jo strayed in at the cobbler’s door, but, scoffed at
as a fool,
He found the conversation too exhaustin’, as a rule;
Or, canted on the smithy coke, he’d hoist his feet
and yawn,
His boots slid up his shinbones, and his pants dis-
playin’ brawn;
And if the copper chanced along ’twas beautiful to
see
| Jo wear away and make hisself a faded memory.
Then came the universal nark. The Kaiser let her
rip.
They cleared the ring. The scrap was for the
whole world’s championship.
Jo Brown was takin’ notice, lurkin’ shy beneath his
hat,
And every day he crept to see the drillin’ on the flat.
He waited, watchin’ from the furze the blokes in
butcher's blue,
For the burst of inspiration that would tell him
what to do.
He couldn’t lean, he couldn’t lie. He yelled out in
the night.
Jo understood—he’d all these years been spoilin’ for
a fight!
Bight into things he flung himself. He took his kit
and gun,
Mooched gladly in the dust, or roasted gaily in the
sun.
“Gorstruth,” he said, with shining eyes, “it means
a frightful war,
’N’ now I know this is the thing that Heaven meant
me for.”
Jo went away a corporal, and fought agin the Turk,
And like a duck to water Joey cottoned to the work.
If anythin’ was doin’ it would presently come out
That Joseph Brown from Booragool was there or
thereabout.
He got a batch of medals, and a glorious renown
Attached all of a, sudden to the name of Sergeant
Brown.
Then people talked of Joey as the dearest friend
they had ;
They were chummy with his uncles, or acquainted
with Mg dad.
Jo goes to France, and presently he figures as the
best
Two-handed all-in fighter in the armies of the West,
And men of every age at home and high and low
degree,
We gather now, once went ,to school with Sergeant
Brown, V.C.
Then Hayes and Jo in Flanders met, and very proud
was Hayes
To shake a townsman by the hand, and sing the
hero’s praise.
“Oh, yes,” says Jo, “I’m doin’ well, ’n’ yet I might
do more.
If I was in a hurry, mate, to finish up this war
| I’d lay out every Fritz on earth, but, strike me,
what a yob
A man would be to work himself out of a flamin’
job!”
Now Jo’s a swell lieutenant, and he’s keepin’ up the
pace.
The Record says Lieutenant Brown’s an honor to the
place.
The town gets special mention every time he scores.
We bet
If peace don’t mess his chances up, he’ll be Field-
Marshal yet.
Dad, mother and the uncles Brown and all our
people know
That Providence began this war to find a grip for Jo!

The WILD CAT
COLUMN
So, after all, there was an imitation of the
crayfish. The contract entered into by the
Victorian Government to take coal from the
Brown mines at Newcastle differs materially
from the one into which the N. S. Wales
Ministry was discovered to be in a hurry to
rush the two States. Premier Holman has,
of course, been since talking about the readi-
ness of the Victorian Ministry to “recognise
the binding nature of the understanding pre-
viously arrived fit” and the baseness of indi-
viduals in Sydney who had been looking at
the business with a cold eye. Unfortunately
for Holman, Bowser of Vic. has been giving
reasons for not recognising the binding
nature of the understanding which Holman
and co. alleged to exist. Instead of agreeing
to take 1,000,000 tons of coal annually for
five years from the Richmond and Relaw
Main mines at 15s. f.0.b., Bowser has under-
taken to accept delivery of 200.000 tons a year
at 235. 7d. delivered in trucks at Melbourne
or 235. sd. at Geelong. And he has done this
in order to “please the N. 8. Wales Govern-
ment.” Further, a clause has been put into
the contract providing that if the coal can-
not be supplied from the Brown mines the
X. S. Wales Ministry shall supply cpal from
other mines. Which isn’t a bit like the
original deal the Government tried to work
off. What is still shrouded in gloom is why
it should “please” N. S. Wales if Victoria
agreed to take Brown coal without calling
tenders for other coal and why N. S. Wales
should derive great satisfaction from dis-
posing of coal with a proviso that such coal
shall be “free from royalty.” And the mys-
tery about the nature of any preliminary
agreement or contract with Brown in which
tiie State had become involved rerjiains as
deep as ever. There may be a simple expla-
nation of the secretiveness of the Ministry,
of the mysterious flittings about of two or
three Ministers, of frequent conferences with
Brown, of the complete abandonment of one
proposal and the adoption of another. It
ought to be made, and in the Assembly
this week members should insist upon
the lid being lifted. The policy of winning
wars by converting Ministers into scouts for
John Brown is open to the mild objection
that Brown is liable to get someone by the
nose.

Previous to 1917 this co. issued half-yearly
accounts; now there is only an annual publi-
cation, and in the foregoing table the figures
for previous terms have been grouped for
convenience of comparison. The public, if
it is paying higher fares, has gained at least
one thing during the year: by applying to
the Government for a Commission to in-
quire whether higher fares were warranted,
the co. conceded the right of the public to
have a word to say in regard to the control
of privately-owned public utilities. F. N.
Yarwood, the Commissioner whom the Gov-
ernment appointed, reported :
(а) That the need for increased revenue has been
proven;
(б) That the additions to the fares now proposed
by the co. are under all the circumstances fair and
reasonable.
The increases came into force on September
9. “and,” the directors say, “these have been
the means of placing the eo.’s affairs in a
more satisfactory position.” The Commis-
sioner—F. N. Yarwood is a front-rank public
accountant and auditor—determined the
capital in the material assets used in the
business as not less than £585,000. The
share capital at the time was £466.667.
Thus, besides the visible reserves, there were
internal reserves £115,000. Of the £466,667
no less than £146,373 consists of undivided
profit distributed as capital during the seven
years prior to the sitting of the Commission ;
and there were distributions before that.
Thus of the material assets valued at
£585,000 less than half was paid for with
money provided by the shareholders. The
balance—more than half—consists of profit
in excess of the dividend of 10 p.c. or more
made a few years ago. Looking at the whole
position it is obvious that the interests of
the shareholders have been much better
attended to than the interests of the public.
In the days when the co. was making 15 p.c.
or more on its capital, as it obviously must
have been doing, no notice was taken of the
frequent demand for an inquiry into the
business of the co., with a view to determine
whether a reduction in fares was warranted
But as soon as the co. was pinched a bit,
there was a yell, and the Government
promptly listened, to ascertain whether an
increase wasn't called for. However, as
mentioned above, the co. has now conceded
the right of the public to look into its affairs;
and that is a right which will certainly be
insisted upon when costs are reduced.
“Taking the 1013 basis,” the Commis-
sioner reported, “the increase in wages costs
between that year and 1010 is 40 p.c., and
there has also been an increase between 1010
and 1017 of 0 p.c.” The Bulletin is, how-
ever, unable to find in the report anything
at all to justify these startling figures.
Appendix A shows that wages paid in 1013
were £84,275: in 1010 £100,132, and that is
an increase of no more than 20 p.c. Mean-
time, however, the services—or, at any rate,
the revenues—had increased ; so that actu-
ally the wages in proportion to gross earn-
ings increased only from 45 p.c. to 40 p.c.—
that is, by 4 p.c. The attempt that has been
made to show, or at least to suggest, that
the increase of wages to the wretchedly-paid
employees, from captains to deckhands, was
responsible for the impoverishment of the co
is wholly without warrant ; as a matter of
fact, wliile the wages in proportion to gross
earnings increased by only 4 p.c., the amount
paid for supplies, rents, etc., increased by 7
p.c. on the same basis.
The published accounts show that, after
making provision of an unspecified amount,
for depreciation, the net profit for the past
year was £28,(588. To this, however, must
be added £10(52 which has been put to an
insurance fund. Considering that the largely
increased fares came into operation only in
September and that the coal strike not only
added to costs but deprived the co. of the
new Zoo traffic (the Zoo being closed for a
couple of months), the figures are quite
satisfactory from the shareholders’ point of
view. The directors are apparently satis-
fied, too. because, whereas they paid only
24 p.c. for the first half, they put the rate
up to 34 p.c. for the second half, making
(5 p.c. for the year. The Commissioner, it
is true, considered that “at the present time
....a minimum of 8 p.c. to shareholders is
a fair and reasonable expectancy to share-
holders in this venture.” On this point,
however, the Commissioner’s opinion can be
worth no more than that of any other intel-
ligent person. And it is quite clear that a
very large number of people don’t agree w r ith
him, because at the present moment, while
only 0 p.c. div. is being paid, the shares are
above par in the open market—the 10s.
shares were sold at 11s. 6d. on the day the
present report was issued.
A couple of months back the co. took over
the Balmain New Ferry Co., paying 50,000
£1 shares for the undertaking: hence the
lew' hundred pounds additional required to
pay the past year’s dividend. The purchase
gives the co. not only some boats but also a
considerable estate at Middle Harbor. Landed
property is now valued in the books at
£168,222, as against £133,871 a year ago.
ship property at £323,283, as against
£301.800 (there have been sales as well as
purchases) and wharves and waiting rooms
at £40,141, as against £35,603. The move-
ment in the past four years has been this
way:—

South Brisbane Gas Co. —For three
years past applications for the accounts of
this co. have met with no response. It was
a fact, certainly, that previous accounts had
given The Bulletin no pleasure and little
satisfaction; and finally on Feb. 12, 1914.
shareholders were urged to find out whether
they were not living in a fool’s paradise and
to insist upon a competent accountant being
brought in from outside to overhaul the co.’s
affairs. Apparently, however, the share-
holders were content to live in the fool’s
paradise; and it was not until an investiga-
tion had to be made under the Queensland
Gas Act 1916 that the rotten condition of
things was exposed. Actually, it seems, at
the end of 1914 the directors had made what
purported to be a revaluation of assets and
thereupon issued to shareholders £lOO.OOO
worth of debenture stock free of cost. The
result of this revaluation of assets and issue
of bonus stock is seen in the latest balance-
sheet, which claims assets £318,588. For the
purpose of determining the price to be charged
for gas it was necessary for the Gas Referee
to value the assets. This was done upon evi-
dence, and the best the co.’s own expert could
do for it was £1<35,020, although he con-
sidered that something should be added for
expenditure not represented by tangible
assets. On evidence the Referee fixed “the
present value of the amount invested in the
undertaking” at £160,051.
Either the co.’s own expert and the Gas
Referee are thus hopelessly wrong, or the
issue to shareholders of the £lOO.OOO of de-
benture stock, as a bonus, was not only un-
justified but highly improper. Now. what
could have been the object of the transac-
tion V Early in 1014, it may be recalled, the
N. S. Wales Parliament got to work on a
Gas Bill; and there was good reason to sup-
pose that similar legislation would follow in
Queensland. Is it a reasonable thing to
assume that when the assets of the co. were
valued at a preposterous figure, and when
bonus stock was issued to shareholders, the
directors did not have this probable legisla-
tion in their minds? In that connection,
what is the meaning of this from the report
of the Gas Referee:—
On November 14 Mr. James Hurll, managing
director of the Ann of James Hurll and Co.. Ltd.,
called on me and informed me that Mr. Arthur
A. Tourney, one of the directors of his co., had
been notified by the South Brisbane Gas Co. that
he would be required to give evidence at the hear-
ing of the Reference supporting , the valuation he
made in November, 1914, and that as such valua-
tion had been made by him simple to agree with
an amount which had been furnished to him and
on the understanding that it was not in anv way
lor public use, and that as lie (Tourney) was quite
unable to justify the valuation, he "desired that
Mr. tourneys evidence be dispensed with.
Apparently Tourney’s valuation wasn't a
valuation at all. What happened, possibly
ami judging by Hurll’s remark, was that the
engineer was given a total and asked in
etiect; “If the assets arc in the aggregate
worth so much, what are the items worth?”
The questions are: Did the directors know
that the so-called valuation was not a genu-
ine oneV D.d they procure or assist in mak-
Hig a bogus valuation? If thev did. with
what object did they do it? Did they know
that the assets were not worth what they
were valued at when the bonus stock was
issued? If so, why was the bonus stock
issued? On the answers will depend whether
the directors or some of them should be pro-
secuted for conspiracy. The case certainly
demands .a searching inquiry.

The C. B. of A. made a colossal splash dur-
ing Melbourne’s big boom of the ’eighties and
early ’nineties; and the smash was in the
same class. Most of the old share capital
was then written off as lost: all that remains
of it (and _this and more was supplied by
colls) is £95,659 in 191,818 ordinary shares.
The depositors were, however, invited to take
4 p.c. pref. shares, and, though they knew
they were only likely to get 8 p.c. for many
years, they took £2.117,850 of this capital in
the bank. Unfortunately there had not been
hard enough writing down, and term by term
ever since a large part of the profit has gone
to reduce the estimated further deficiency.
The nursing and marketing of the old
flock of lame ducks was given over to an
Assets Trust, which, though nominally sepa-
rate. was for all practical purposes part of
the bank. Combining the figures of the two
we get these results :

Until two or three years ago there was among
the assets a gradually diminishing amount
representing “estimated value of the assets
of the old bank.” Then that item disap-
peared. and it looked as though the last of
the assets of the old bank had been realised ;
nevertheless this half-year the directors say:
“Recoveries in connection with old depen-
dencies have increased the actual capital to
the extent of £10.000.” It would be amazing
if the recovery was an exact £10,000; it is
much more probable that astute general-
manager Heron protected his valuation and
his subsequent realisations by a contingency
account, into which lie now dips for a round
£lO.OOO. In the past seven years the capital
deficiency has been made good to the extent
of £.‘>Bo.ooo, and £OBO,OOO is still to he pro-
vided, less whatever inner reserve may exist;
and on past performances that looks like a
12 years’ job. True, the more profit that is
accumulated the bigger the earnings should
he: another £300.000, for instance, should
easily earn £17,500 a year. And that should
reduce the period required for shifting the
dead horse. But it has to be noted that
for four years past the pref. capital
has been getting its maximum 4 p.e.
instead of the 3 p.c. with which it was
starved for many years while the deficit was
being made good (for the benefit mainly of
the ordinary capital) ; and, moreover, it is
highly probable that, as soon as the world’s
pulse is normal again, a proposal will be
revived to give the ordinaries a taste.
The Commercial of Australia has a well-
marked policy of its own ; it is a pioneering
bank, with no less than 272 branches and
agencies, or 40 more than it had four years
ago. And it will get 12 or 15 more in a
lump by absorbing the little National of
Tasmania. This, no doubt, means heavy
overhead charges—for salaries, etc. But a
bank of this character performs a big public
service. Also it has excellent chancds of
building up a very big business with the
development of the country. There are
many disappointments, no doubt; but now
and again there are surprises like the Malice,
which must have yielded a fine addition to
the C. B. of A.’s revenue. From the creditor’s
point of xuew there is one big thing to be
said for the cocky : lie nearly always pays.
The city man. if misfortune hits him and he
can’t pay within a few months, very often
thinks it, a fair thing not to pay at all. Thg
cocky, if he can’t pay this year, hardly ever
thinks that he shouldn’t pay next year; and
if he can’t do it then the chances are he will
turn up the following year with a smile and
the money and an invitation to his creditor
to come and have a drink on the strength of
it.
So the hank’s figures go on growing:—

Liabilities now total £5,(557.351; and liquid
assets represent nearly 48 p.c. of that
amount. Deducting liquid assets from the
liabilities, there is £4,540.762 of debt not
thus represented ; and against that there is
£5,703,834 of advances (after providing for
doubtful accounts) and premises written
down to £456,060. The position seems to
be thoroughly sound ; and it is steadily im-
proved, of course, by the excellent propor-
tion of profits put by. Some day, consider-
ing the huge proportion of capital which
carries' a maximum of 4 p.c., and in view of
the prospects of the business, the ordinaries
will get something worth having.

(ills the demand for a motor of more rugged mechani-

Elbert Hubbard correctly described the word
“failure” when he said “An opportunity to say T
told you so,’ ” There should be no opportunity for
anyone to say “1 told you so’ after you have
chosen the roofing for your homestead, dairy, barn
or outhouse. Choose a roofing that has been tried
and its success recognised—a roofing that will resist
the elements —that will neither rot, rust, sweat,
crumble nor pinhole—that will not affect drinking
water, .vet at the same time be waterproof—that is
cheap to buy, cheap to freight and easily handled.
“Adarnax” Roofing answers these points most per-
fectly. It costs one-third less than galvanised-iron
and reduces freight charges by a. proportionate
amount. The various Governments of the Common-
wealth have agreed that “Adarnax” Roofing is the
“ideal” roofing, for they have used it in large quan-
tities with great success. All interested in roofings
now or in the future should write for free booklet—

For grinding all classes of material in Ball Mills
and Tube Mills it is necessary to have a suitable
grinding medium. The mines in West Australia,
also numerous cement plants, are using balls of forged
tyre steel, and find that they give excellent results.
These balls may be obtained in various sizes from
the Austral Otis Engineering Co. of Melbourne, who
have put in a special plant for forging them, and
can give delivery of most sizes from stock. This
company also manufactures forged steel shoes and
dies for battery work. — Advt. [3

l'he reserves of £668,867 are made up in this
way:—•
Premiums on shares .. £558,330
General reserves . . . . 34,230
Meter renewal fund . . 9,991
Unappropriated profit . . 66,316
But in addition to those visible reserves
there is a large internal reserve consisting
of works paid for out of revenue. During
the past seven years £398,342 of profit has
been spent in extension and improvement of
plant. Only a small portion of this money
has been for replacements; most of it has
been for works that could fairly be charged
to capital account. One consequence has
been a very large increase in the, profit shown
in proportion to the total outlay charged to
capital:—
1907. 1917.
Total outlay charged to
capital .. .. •• £2,171,745 £2,472,540
Half-year’s revenue .. 224,428 472,228
Revenue p.c. of capital outlay 10.3 19.1
'thus, though only £300,795 of new works
constructed during the past 10 years have
been paid for by dipping into the share-
holders’ pockets or pledging their credit, the
half-year’s revenue has increased by £247,800.
In addition to providing shareholders with
their dividend, the co.’s customers are
being requireu to supply it with new revenue-
producing property to the extent of over
£50,000 a year. It seems a bit more than a
fair thing.
The past half-year’s profit has. however,
been a good deal less than usual for a July-
December term. The coal strike “compelled
us to purchase from other sources supplies
of coal at greatly enhanced prices.” Appar-
ently coal cost the co. about £35,000 more
than the quantity required to produce the
same quantity of gas would have done in the
corresponding half of 1916. Cost of coal
has, however, been steadily increasing for
many years

Cost of coal p.c. of
revenue . . . . 22 p.c. 27 p.c. 30 p.c. 37 p.c.
A still bigger advance would be shown if the
cost were taken in proportion to gas sales
only: a remarkable increase in the revenue
from by-products has helped the figures very
materially. In the latter half of 1907 these
by-products realised £42,818; in the past
half-year £105,294. In the next little com-
parison the total gross revenue is divided
among the contributors .

The by-products now may be said to provide
the profit. In fact, last half-year’s gas revenue
was £20,000 less than total costs, including
interest on borrowed money. But it is
doubtful whether by-products will show any-
thing like such figures after the war.
The next comparison makes an attempt to
trace, not only the increased earnings, but
the increased outgoings:—

While revenue has thus increased in 10
years by 310 p.c., outgoings are 162 p.c.
higher. These outgoings are exclusive of
interest on capital and a few odds and ends
—bad debts, etc.
Still, when all this is said, there has been
a profit on the new business; and even last
half-year, after paying out over £85,000 for
repairs, renewals and replacements, and pro-
viding interest on debentures and other bor-
rowed money, the profit was 11J p.c. p.a. on
the share capital, including premium capital
paid on shares. If the profit (at £375,000 a
year) were capitalised at 7 p.c. it would
amount to £2.500.000, equal to a shade over
£l3 per share.

ic had heavy losses. In 1884 the manager of the
Beaconsfield branch was stuck up by armed men,
his keys were taken and about £3OOO w r as stolen.
Some suspected persons were put on their tiial
but discharged. They afterwards brought an action
against the bank and were awarded damages. One
of them was, later, convicted of circuiting the
stolen notes; another was convicted of perjury and
turned informer, incriminating those who had pre-
viously been on trial. Two of them were again
tried, but without a conviction. In 1885, after
receiving a report on the position of the bank from
a Melbourne accountant, George Horne, the man-
agement decided to reorganise. A new co. was
formed and called the National Bank of Tasmania,
Ltd., and George Horne was appointed manager.
Since then things have gone pretty smoothly, and
the shareholders have got in dividends twice the
amount of their capital. It is interesting, by the
way, to recall that both the Union Bank of Aus-
tralia and the Bank of Australasia had their genesis
in Launceston.
“Blue Geebung” : The co. which supplies
the city of Sydney with gas gives the whole
of its coal contract to one firm (J. and A.
Brown), with the result that it is unable to
accumulate a reserve stock of coal. It had
during the late coal strike to cease the
supply of gas to consumers several, weeks
earlier than the co. which has to get its coal
carried 000 miles further to supply Mel-
bourne with iiluminant; and which, dividing
its contract between two firms (Hetton and
Caledonian Collieries), got a more regular
supply and was enabled to accumulate a
a rv necessary reserve of raw product.
What position will Sydney be in when the
coal-miner next refuses to go below, since it
will be getting only the remnants of coal the
Brown firm can spare after satisfying ttie
large wants of the Victorian Government ?

Melbourne-owned Adelong Creek (M.S.W.)
wound up its December half-year with a
working profit of £5672. This was a record
for the co., and was due to No. 1 dredge
sluicing 2110 oz. gold out of 338,900 cubic
yards of ground. Costs were low at 2.93 d.
per cubic yard, and a profit of £4OlB was
earned. No. 2 plant, on almost as good
ground, put through 260,600 cubic yards,
but with costs at 4.20 d. the ' -orking profit
was only £1655. Enough cash was earned
to pay a couple of Is. divs. and bin £lOOO
of war bonds. Yields for this month have
not been so good, but they will improve
again as the No. 1 dredge gets into the bet-
ter ground ahead.
Amalgamated Hill End (N.SW.) is stak-
ing almost everything on the deepening of
the Star of Peace shaft another 150 ft. or
so. In the early ’7o’s this shaft contributed
largely to the 17.1430 z. of gold got from the
mine in four years; but the bottom has not
been explored for over 40 years. Substantial
Government aid is said to have been granted
to help the co # test the deep levels. Mean-
while. the Reward, to the north, is running
the 14-head stamp one shift and keeping the
drills going on*the stone below. The Central,
between the Reward and the Amalgamated,
continues the drive that will unwater the
Reward to 900 ft. Several attempts Lave
been made on the field lately to locate some
of the rich stone that exists in tradition, but
nothing favorable has been reported.
Mount Boppy, Cobar (N.S.W.), intends to
resume production; the works were hung up
early last year for want of development. In
plain English, for want of void in the stone
available. In recent times the output has
been from 70,000 to 80,000 tons a year, but
values w'ere lately under 10s. per ton, though
the treatment was the most elaborate in
the State. Lateral development has time
after time proved ore bodies parallel to the
main lode, and this has induced the directors
to resume wmrk. In normal times costs
amounted to 225. Od. per ton of ore.
Great Britain sluicing (N.S.W.) is to
hand out another Is. on its modest little
10.000 shares. This makes 63 distributions
or more than six times the capital.
Justice Neville, of the English Chancery
Court, has sanctioned the payment of £1
per share (£68,659) by the old E. and A.
Copper Co., which ceased smelting at Wara-
t.ah f N.S.W.) last year. The authorised
capital is £105,000, in 70,000 shares of 30s.
each, and 68,659 shares are issued. The
S.A. Government took over the wharf owned
by the co. at Port Adelaide, and that was a
lift. Most shareholders will consider them-
selves lucky to get £1 per share by the
liquidation of a business that in recent years
lias paid only Is. per share p.a.
Boyd, general manager of Mt. Morgan,
has been reinforced by the appointment of
Horsburgh as assistant g.-m. This ought to
turn out good business. Boyd is weakest on
the metallurgical side, and Horsburgh is
strongest there. After taking a course at
Sydney Uni., where he impressed the men
he was working with, Horsburgh went north,
and was metallurgist at Molloy in its divi-
dend days. From there he went to Chillagoe
as metallurgist, and lately has been manager.
Queensland Mines Department has made
a start at opening up the arsenic deposits
outside Stanthorpe. The Government has
reserved about 150 acres, and contemplates
erecting a large treatment plant if results
justify it. Sample ore has given 30 p.e.
arsenic. The eradication of prickly-pear
with cost-price acid is one of the ulterior
objects of the enterprise.
Did Edna May Deeps last half-year crush
only 3760 tons from the 566 ft. level, or was
the yield of 545G0z. reported by Bob Stuckey
inclusive of gold got from 480 tons which he
says was drawn from the 4<oft. level? That
dirt is stuff, so he might explain whether
it went to the battery. On November 6 the
co.’s cash position glittered with bank credits
of £11,400, but that included £6OOO from the
sale of reserve shares and from calls. Things
would have been even better if costs hadn't
soared. Wages, stores, fuel, timber, repairs
and water amounted to over 675. per ton,
and, if the expenditure on plant is added, the
whole of the mine charges aggregated
£16,653. That sum divided by the tonnage
reported gives 89s. per ton as costs, apart
from head-office expenses. Stuckey estimates
ore reserves as follows:
Tons Value Total
Level. Ore. per ton. value.
480 ft. .. 9,520 40/- £19,040
506 ft. . . 20,000 80/- 80,000
29,520 £99,040
There are also 5060 tons valued at 205.,
bringing the total up to £104.040. Stuckey
plans to leave as much of this ore as he can
while he shoves the winzes down 250 ft.
These must act as blind shafts, and will
furnish pay dirt while finding out the
behavior of the reef underfoot. If the shoot
pitches north, he can convert the present
shaft into an underlie ; it it makes more to
the south, as he indicates, he may keep
the shaft vertical. Incidentally, he will also
get evidence on the water problem ; but his
penalty for working like this must be to
keep up costs. And while costs are at or
above the £3 mark profits will be about
£2OOO per month, winch won’t give enough
to maintain the present 6d. div. However.
Stuekev reckons (1) that he has locked out
the Edna May water ; (2) that even if some
gets in. his plant will keep it under: and
' that with cash in hand, and returns
from workin"' in ore and reduction in costs,
he can pay at least the 6d. divs. His gamble
is to be in the western ground, where he is
driving and boring.
* * *
The Olonbinane Gold and Antimony Co.,
near Kilmore (Vic.), one of the wild cats
brought to life again by the war-demand for
antimony, snuffed out recently after a few
months’ work. The other day the £5OOO of
plant, which is under 12 months old, was
put up for sale by auction, but £4OO was
the best offer. The whole outfit is said to
have been sold privately since for £5OO, so
the mostl.v-Melbonfne shareholders have
dropped £4500 on the machinery alone.
Failure was due to excessive cost of ore
treatment, owing to technical difficulties.
The mine was worked years ago for gold,
but the cheap antimony refused to be sepa-
rated from the gold. The new co. was after
the antimony, the gold being considered
merely as a side-line.
* * * *
The Sutherland regime at Tasman and
Crown I .veil is over. The co. is now in W.
B. Arnold’s office, and a call or two will be
made to do some more finicking with the
ore and to link un the new power. Then if
the war keeps metals up. profits are to come.
Thus talk the optimists. The bears lick
their chaps in anticipation.
“Karaji”: What’s the use of having great
natural resources, anyhow? One of the
great wants of Westralia is coal. Collie
coal-measures are of the same age as the
Clarence River CN.S.W.) beds, and cannot
be regarded as better than second-class: but
in the Irwin River district, not far from
navigable water, the permo-carboniferous
formation is largely developed, and in those
beds are found the glacial deposits which are
associated with the rich coal seams of the
South Maitland field, also of permo-carbon-
iferous age. Yet no attempt has been made
to prospect those deposits, although a tithe
of the money lost last year in the States
agricultural implement factory would suffice.
The Consols, owned by Mount Elliott,
Clone urry, is on fire «it the deepest lev el
(480 ft.). This mine adjoins the, Hampden,
where such encouraging developments have
occurred recently at the 500 ft. and 600 ft.
levels. Bursts of carbonic-acid gas have
been frequent in the Consols, indicating in-
tense chemical action. Elliott had arranged
to commence another smelting campaign, so
the outbreak falls very awkwardly. _ And
these mine fires are the very mischief to
handle. #

BEAUTIFUL COMPLEXIONS
WITHOUT ROUGE.
Ladies who dislike rouge and “make-up”
—and what lady of refinement does not?—
often ask what they can do to restore the
natural velvety bloom of childhood to faded,
sallow, wrinkled cheeks. All such ladies, as
well as those who now have good com-
plexions and wish to preserve them, can
realise their hearts’ desire by getting their
chemist to prepare a lotion composed of 2oz.
rose water, 1 dram tincture of benzoin and
2oz. flowers of oxzoin. Before using shake
thoroughly, and then apply with a soft cloth
or sponge. When dry brush lightly with a
soft cloth or piece of chamois leather. If
you will do this whenever you go out you
will be astonished at the absolutely natural
and refined improvement in your appearance.
This lotion is also exceptionally beneficial in
relieving and preventing chapped faces and
hands as well as redness due to exposure to
weather.— Advt.

A WOMAN'S
LETTER
Sydney, January 28, 1918.
My Dear .Akim, —
Anniversary Day brought the usual fea-
tures, served up on ice, or with merely tepid
ginger-pop, as circumstances dictated. Judge
Backhouse stepped out of the regatta com-
mittee’s best chair this year—as a protest
against sport in war-time. But most of the
sports at the Harbor party were well over
fighting age, and, wuii A. G. Milson as act-
ing-president, told mild tales of tubs of long
ago. Q. L. Deloitte, an amateur mariner of
great form in the ’sixties, discursed on bygone
battles of the sculls. The racing events of
Saturday were mere pale ghosts of the gam-
bols of pre-war days, the committee’s object
being merely to keep this oldest regatta in
the world alive.
Under the shade of an uncertain umbrella
R. J. Black, M.L.C., read several pages of
ancient Australian story. The spot was
close by the soft splash of the fountain which
has the bold figure of the indomitable
Phillip, in bronze, as presiding deity. From
that green terrace on the summit of the
Palace Garden lawns the skipper of the his-
toric First Fleet keeps eternal vigil, with
the thin hook-nose turned towards the
Pacific. As president of the Pioneer Club,
Black, M.L.C., held the sward for some time.
Then came the breaking of the Jack on an
adjacent pole, after which the company
trotted off to Hunter-street, where the club
sandwich lay in waiting.
Pipes skirled around the statue of Bobbie
Burns on Saturday afternoon. Prof. Andy
Stuart, after composing his features for the
camera, broke out into interesting details of
the poet-ploughman’s life. Under his arm he
carried two ancient calf-bound tomes, and
awe-stricken silence followed his dramatic
opening of both volumes. The Scawtcli chief
of the Sydney medical school was a lad in
Dumfries years ago. Near that old town
in 1791 Burns wrote immortal verse and
farmed his land; and in Dumfries young
Andy saw tiie funeral of the poet’s last two
sons, Colonel Nicol and Colonel James
Burns. In the old books, given to the Pro-
fessor in the long ago, is the original “Auld
Lang Syne”—it was afterwards altered and
added to by Burns —also the Jacobite li>t,
‘ ocots Wha Hae.” So the crowd that gath-
ered round the statue got more than it ex-
pected, and one ancient Caledonian went off
in vocal fireworks that sounded like “Hech !
Hoot! Hey ! Hi—h-s-s-s-h !”
The Davidsons bring two little girls,
Diana and Daphne, aged seven and eight,
to old Government House in Macquarie-
street. Possibly a wounded Coldstream or
two will come on sick leave as part of the
staff. Lady Davidson’s brother, Colonel
Feilding, is in command of that gilt-edged
regiment; hence the chance of its sending a
hurt-in-war sample or two of manly beauty
to cheer the local belle. But this is all
guessing. The new Governor maintains a
masterly reticence as to who or what comes
in his train from Newfoundland.
St. Vincent’s Hospital Nightingales wore
the heroines of a Roll-of-Honor gathering the
other moonlit night. The party began with
euchre and bell-ringing—the latter by a
model of industry who brought belated
players to the tables. A huge crowd —
tickets at ss. each represented the spoils
which go to the Nurses’ Home building
fund —sauntered into the garden space. Here
the four walls of the Home, built in Spanish
quadrangle style, shut out the dust that is
Darlinghurst. Entirely surrounded by re-
freshments, visitors listened to the remarks
of Surgeon Howse, not so long back from
the Front—it was he who pulled aside the
white-and-blue drapery to show the hand-
some honor board. On it are the names of
St. Vincent’s nurses who have tended the
wounded wherever the Allies’ soldiers march
into battle. Returned healers, in red capes
and grey gowns, sang “God Save” so softly
that it sounded like a gentle lullaby to those
who had fallen to sleep under alien skies.
Harley McLaughlin was master of cere-
monies.
Justice Chubb has been spending the long
vacation in this State. With a married
daughter (Mrs. North) and her pretty chick
he’s been doing Jenolan Caves—which take
seme doing—and seeing the cream and roses
of the South Coast.
A very quiet wedding took place at St.
John’s, Darlinghurst, when Olive Cunning-
hame, of Bayswater-road, said she would to
Montague Chubb. He’s a son of the Queens-
land Judge. The bride was in foamy white,
with a large white hat over her piquant face.
With her hand tucked in the arm of Mr.
Harry Abbott, who handed her over to her
new husband, she looked like a little school-
miss beside the big guardian. Dorothy Per-
rins, sole bridesmaiden, was in ivory and
azure finery. Leonard Stephen was second-
best man. Justice Chubb was in the party;
so was the youthful-looking mother of the
bride. The toasts were drunk at the Aus-
tralia.
Ilendy-Pooley, of a well-known N. S.
Wales family, heard the bugles call. He
was then in a comfortable job in the Regis-
trar-General’s office, and there were seven
good reasons—a wife and six youngsters—
to keep him there. But he put them aside ; and
“Killed in action” is his brief epitaph. But
his mates won’t let it rest at that. They’re
formed into a Building Fund Committee to
help the little things this citizen-soldier left
behind him; and the State War Council
approves of th,eir concert in St. James’s Hall
this Friday evening. The programme is so
good that you’ll have five shillings’ worth for
the 2s. asked for a reserved seat.
Mrs. Lewis, a war widow who used to be
Gertrude Tait, daughter of the old Arch-
deacon of Parkes, has gone north again,
taking her baby with her. She was matron
of Pt. Darwin Hospital when she married
Captain Lewis, a permanent military man
there. He was killed; and so miserable is
the Australian military pension that the
widow bows her head and takes her precious
infant back with her to her old job.
Captain Archie Collins, one of the latest
batch of Australians to win the Military
Cross, took his medical degree with first-
class honors at Sydney Uni. a couple of
years ago, and was acting-superintendent at
Prince Alfred Hospital for a while before
enlisting. His work in pathology and micro-
biology brought him tbe first travelling
fellowship under the Walter and Eliza Hal!
foundation for research abroad ; but he did
his travelling in a troopship instead, and
left scientific research to wait till a press-
ing job in Flanders is completed. A brother,
who also wears three stars, was wounded
at Passchendale, and is being patched
up in an English hospital. Their father,
now deceased, was headmaster of the State
school at Manly.
You will remember painter Gordon Coutts,
one-time instructor at Sydney Royal Art
Society and represented in the Gallery by
a portrait of The Bulletin’s old friend,
George Reid, and other canvases. One of
his promising Sydney students was Miss
Alice Hobbs, whom he afterwards married
in ’Frisco. They were in Paris when the
war started, but hurriedly packed up
and returned to the U.S.A. After
living in Piedmont for two years,
Coutts returned to Paris, but his wife
refused to risk the U-boats. Then the artist
decided to do his bit, and was with the Bed
Cross in France for some time. Becoming
ill, he went to Tangiers to recuperate, and
was glorying in that country’s color when
he was astounded to have divorce papers
served on him. He flung his brushes and
palette aside, and hastened to Beno, where
Mrs. Coutts had become domiciled, to con-
test the suit. The lady alleged that her
husband’s artistic temperament was too
much for her and constituted cruelty.
Coutts tried to effect a reconciliation, but
failed, and finally filed an answer, mention-
ing an ex-Maoriland lawyer (who had
already secured a Beno divorce) as co-re.
Coutts’s solicitor, however, advised him to
drop the cross-suit. “You will get the worst
of it,” he said; “a woman has only to shed
a few tears on the stand in a Reno divorce
court, and the best case in the world is
lost.” So the case was uncontested, and
Beno decided to free the lady from the
cruelty of an artistic temperament. “When
I was 21,” writes Coutts bitterly, “I thought
I knew women; now I know I don’t know
them and never did.” Here is the lady,
from a charming portrait by her husband
hung on the line of the Boyal Academy last
year.
The Bev. Mother of the Sacred Heart
Convent, Sydney, who died last week, was
sister of the once well-known Monsignor
Weld, of London, and niece of Frederick
Aloysius Weld, once Governor of Maoriland,
Tasmania and Westralia. The Welds are
closely related to the Vaughans, most emi-
nent of English B.C. families. The deceased
nun had worked many years in Australia,
chiefly in Sydney.
Sydney violinist Donald Mcßeath sends a
line. His training—he’s in the Canadian
Flying Corps—took longer than he expected,
and his wings were slow in growing. But
“nearly fledged now,” he says, “and leav-
ing soon for France.... The American girl
I leave behind me is Eileen Miller.”
Governors come and Governors go, but the
Official Secretary, like the perpetual curate
in Trollope’s tales, goes on for ever. The
individual is gathered to his fathers. The
office remains. The name of Budge has
been associated with the N. S. Wales Pub-
lic Service for the last 00 years. Budge
pare came from England while we were still
a Crown colony, cold-shouldered by the
Titus Barnacles
o f Downing-street.
After many years in
the service, he was
appointed Official
Secretary and Clerk
of the Executive
Council. ’Way back
in earlier years
Edward Merewether,
Charles Cowper and
othe r well-known
men held the billet.
Possibly the oldest
in the Public Ser-
vice, it is the nearest
approach there is to
a link between the
Crown, as repre-
sented by a Cocked
Hat, and the Man
in the Street. When Sir Harry Baw-
son, inexperienced in gubernatorial ways,
arrived, the Official Secretaryship had
become a shadowy thing. The plain-
spoken old Admiral asked for a new
man—the best for the special task of keep-
ing a strange Governor off the shoals.
Critchett Walker, then Principal Under-
Sec., named H. C. Budge, son of that
former able official who reigned long in the
billet, and he has cultivated a charming
manner and a silent tongue in the office ever
since. He grew a few lines in his face
while he sat at the elbow of the ever-restless
up-at-dawn Governor Strickland. Private
Secretaries came and went. The confiden-
tial Australian nib plodded on. In spite
of many difficulties —for the Chief was hard
to please—relations were never strained.
The Strickland family left Australia with
regret; and they continue a friendly and
frequent correspondence with their old Offi-
cial Secretary, whose loyalty, courtesy and
tact appealed to them all, as it has to so
many of us who have come in occasional
contact with him.
Popular Lily Lyon, daughter of the late
John Lamb Lyon, of Long Nose Point, was
wed in Brisbane to engineer William Chap-
man, a son of that skipper whose forefathers
have gone down to the sea in ships for gener-
ations. Daddy Lyon, of Lyon and Cottier,
was one of this State’s leading stained-glass
decorators. A year or so ago, at the age of
80-something, the old gentleman retired from
the business, leaving his two sons and daugh-
ter Lily to take joint charge. The “firm”
didn’t like to part with her, but her husband
and the butcher and the vacuum-cleaner
demand her time.
Leon Gellert, tall, fair-haired and the
owner of a sensitive face, has been over
from Adelaide, holidaying with Norman
Lindsay. You can find his poetic fancy
floating free in Norman’s post-referendum
drawing, “Only the Ghosts of Yes” —shamed
phantoms marching to the trenches, instead
of a cohort of flesh-and-blood reinforce-
ments. Leon wears the returned soldier’s
badge, and is, as you know, the aesthetic
warrior who wrote the exquisitely melodious
“Songs of a Campaign.” He spent an even-
ing—a genuine poet’s hour —in Premier W.
A. Holman’s home on Bellevue Hill. A flat
roof that overlooked a moonlit harbor and
the honeyed voice of W.A. reading Gellert’s
verse to the little party of three literati gave
one of them (so he says) a Persian-garden
feeling down his spinal marrow.
The new Voluntary Workers’ Cafd is
comfortably housed in McNaught’s base-
ment, Pitt-street, thanks to the kindness of
the lessee of the premises. That’s where
the A.B.C. used to be, you remember?
There was a very solemn gathering at
the Mitchell Library the other afternoon.
Never a joke could come anigh as Deputy-
Governor Cullen handed over the stamp
collection, valued at £15,000, presented by
11. L. White, of Belltrees. Philatelists
spoke in soft whispers, and advanced with
hushed steps towards the Shrine. A hand-
some affair made of Australian wood, with
layers of tiny drawers, houses the treasures
under glass. Carefully penned, like prize
sheep, the distinguished guests have had
their pedigrees drawn out by philatelist
Fred Hagen. On behalf of the trustees
Arthur Dowling rambled amiably round
stamps in general and the H. L. White
gift in particular. A. C. Ebsworth spoke
up on behalf of the owner, who was too shy
to receive in person the welter of oratory in
his honor. C. F. Williams, who presides
over meetings of the Sydney Philatelic Club,
talked waterlines, laureates and diadems;
and Cullen, C.J., broke into such passionate
patriotism—skirting carefully round Aus-
tralia’s status after the war —that a volley
of “Hear, hears” shattered the solemn
silence of the good philatelists.
Beg Wykeham (Hugh Ward’s and Grace
I’alotta’s r,ght-hand man in the days before
Hugh had joined J.C.W.) writes from
France (20/13 /’l7) to say cheer-oh :
I’m still alive, and although we’ve had a pretty
tough time lately I’ve managed to dodge any serious
hurt. A high explosive shell lifted me up the other
day and gently but firmly dropped me on the back
of my neck, but, bar a shaking up, I was none the
worse for it the next day. I’m hoping to get some
English leave in January—l've had 14 months in
France without a break, and am suffering a bit
from “waritis.” With luck, this time next year
should see us all home again.
Died suddenly, at Brisbane, Stephen
Itussell, iiged 03, well known some 15 years
ago in Sydney commercial circles, and an
occasional contributor to The Bulletin.
The immediate cause of death was shock
on receiving news of the death of his only
surviving son, on active service. Mrs. M.
Lalor, a prominent N. S. Wales Labor sup-
porter, is a sister.
“Bosna” still regards the war as a matri-
monial bureau :
Poor old Hymen has been heavily engaged with
Anglo-Australia as usual. lie has had jobs from the
Charles Maclcinnons’ son, of Derribong (N.S.W.),
a sub. in a Reserve Household Battalion, and Alva
Gertrude, daughter of Lt.-Col. Miller, of Alberstone,
Hants; from Major Ilore, of Albury, and Sybil
Smith, of Sydney, who were reinforced by Chaplain-
Major Green at Marylebone; Charles Austin Leigh,
o p Inglewood (Vic.), afid Beatrice, daughter of the
lute Joseph Fell; Capt. Stanley McMaster, of Wari-
'■'n (N.S.W.), and Aileen Courtney, of this Isle;
Colin Gilray, son of Maoriland’s Professor Gilray,
arid M'ss Ethel Standish, also of the Maori Isles;
and Lieut.-Col. Cook, D. 5.0., whose parent was a
Christchurch professor, and Agnetu Haynes, of Read-
ing.
Mrs. John Fell is gathering her friends —
they are mostly tired city girls—round her
in the South Coast bungalow with the
unique name. “No llurri” broods over the
sea on the edge of a little headland. The
wild waves’ chatter is so intimate that one
visitor with an imagination expected them to
walk in as soon as the lights went out.
David Stead, F.L.S., president of the Wild
Life Preservation Society, pleads for a
keener public interest in saving the feath-
ered loveliness of the bush. The IV' >-1.7
report, just out, comments on the pass ? _ .of
the birds o’ paradise and osprey plume as
fashionable gewgaws in the Best Hat. But
lovely woman gets no credit for angelic
desires to save the white heron from extinc-
tion : it is the war that is credited witli
putting the osprey and ofher showy plumes
away in a handbox. However, the infant
population is being duly sworn in as mem-
bers of the Don’t-Kill-Cockrobin Society, and
50,000 kiddies have taken the pledge not to
burgle the bush songster’s nest.
April 26 is to be the grand climax of a

PLAYER PIANO
THE PLAYER THAT PLAYS WITH A SOUL
THE INSTRUMENT YOU WERE BORN TO PLAY.
♦
IT IS THE LATEST AND BEST.
The one who wants to hear the Piano for what it is (A MUSICAL INSTRUMENT) can now have at his
disposal ail that is really musical and artistic.
THIS WONDERFUL INSTRUMENT
has completely revolutionised the musician’s idea of the Player Piano. It is uncanny, and plays with as much
expression, as much soul, as any pianist, and it does many things better than any human being could do them.
Those Avho seek in a Player Piano much more than a mere automatic machine, will be interested in the special
proposition now being made by us.
MR. E. F. WILKS,
General Manager.
IMPORTANT.
The inventor of this world-famous instrument has in the LATEST MODELS (a huge shipment of which
has just arrived) eliminated the wind chest, thereby giving the player 50 per cent, greater repetition with one-
third of the amount of pumping, and at the same time has so simplified and perfected the mechanism that it
enables him to give a 10 YEARS’ FACTORY GUARANTEE, which we pass on to our purchasers. It has the
lightest and smoothest air-motor ever designed, and is practically frictionless, with indestructible, rotating metal
valves instead of the usual cumbersome wooden slides, and, in addition, has a transposing device which enables
you to play a song accompaniment in any key to suit any voice.
YOU OWE IT TO YOURSELF TO TEST OUR STATEMENTS.
♦
We can also convert your own Upright or Grand Piano into
an up-to-date 88-note Player Piano by inserting this wonderful
*2)ucs&vncefld
MECHANISM
without mutilating the case or in any way interfering with the
ordinary hand-playing of the instrument. We will give you a
written guarantee with every installation, also a list of our
clients who have had their instruments converted.

Melbourne, January 28, 1918.
My Dear Yaurie, —
The State Excellency motored to Bol-
warrah on Thursday morning for a day's
fly-fishing in the Moorabool reservoir; but
owing to the heat fishing was voted too
strenuous until evening, when several trout
were landed, including a beautiful four-
pounder—aide Conant is prepared to swear
an affidavit as to the weight, or, if neces-
sary, go so far as to make a wager. On
Friday morning his Ex. and Conant were up
at the milkman’s hour and managed to land
a few fish before dashing back to Melbourne
to resume toil at the old address.
The story goes the rounds that the Ranee
of Pudukota, being white and not Indian-
born, connot keep the wonderful State
jewels that hubby showered on his bride.
They’ve got to be gathered up and held over
for some princess of the blood. This, if
trhe, will give you some idea of how mixed
marriages of this kind are regarded in India,
not only among the whites, but among the
upper-crust natives.
That social dynamo, Mrs. Charles Fair-
bairn seems to have tired of trunks itnd
travel, for hubby has bought her the spin-
ster Payne’s South Yarra house. The Fair-
bairn lady is just back from her sixth trip
to England since the war began. Her last
errand was (1) to see daughter Esther
married to her Argyll Highlander, Major
Wheatley, D. 5.0., and settle the bride in her
Khightbridge flat; (2) to inquire after son
Jim of the R.F.C., wounded and in the hands
of the Boches • and (3) to tend to flying-son
Osborne, also wounded after a gallant piece
of aircraft work. Now she will give some
time to her girleen Betty, who will equal if
not out-distance sister Esther in good looks.
Poor old Bigjolin Forrest has to endure
some more head surgery. He is in a private
hospital again while Mrs. John is within
cooee at the Grand.
You’ll remember pretty Nellie Porter, who
used to live out St. Kilda way and look like
a Madonna in modern clothes. She is now
Mrs. Norman Parbury—and she and her
husband have been quietly growing apples
and kiddies near Hobart. They have gath-
ered their crop of pippins, and are putting
the little Parburys to school. That done,
Norman goes off to worry the War Office
for a job.
There is a strange warrior bird on the
Block at present. He wears a blue-grey
frieze coat with a flying-corps wing on his
arm; but atop of Seawtch red hair and
freckles is a Glengarry cap marked with
brass figures and hieroglyphics. No, not
kilts—just trousers.
The elder of the Como Armytage spin-
sters hopes to reinforce her banking account
with the squab-pigeon industry. The family
acres at Beaconsfield, which she acquired
after they had been auctioned by the Army-
tage trustees, are now white with birds at
feeding-ume.
President Mrs. Hughes, of the N.W.L.,
has just got back from Bananaland, where
her elder hope was ordained. Odd that he
didn’t get his collar fastened front to back
in his native city.
The Henry Cornish pair, lately at Tahiti,
stayed with Sir Robert Walker and his wife
on a tiny island with an unpronounceable
name. Administrator Walker was concerned
in the exciting capture of the German
raider’s crew and the armed launch. His
wife, a young and alarmingly beautiful Eng-
lish girl, was Thursby Bellamy, a niece of
Admiral Farquhar and a relative of Jellicoe.
She is in her early twenties and is an exqui-
site type of English blonde.
Those who remember her as Leah Ilalin-
bonrg will be sorry to hear that Mrs. James
Gillies has lost iier soldier husband. He
went to France as a sergeant-major and was
wounded ; then while he was being carried to
a casualty station a shell exploded that wiped
out the stretcher-bearers and their burden.
Mrs. Gillies, a handsome young Jewess, was
seen on the stage, both under repertory
auspices and with the Firm. She was
married just before her soldier left Australia,
and Leah followed him to England. She is
now with his parents in Glasgow.
Hal Gye has news of Trooper Waller,
his brother, who has been shot through the
elbow. Another warrior brother was killed
some months ago; a third (Percy) is
still in the field. They all started out early
in the whr.
Mrs. Forrest is in Melbourne with her
new daughter-in-law. Her son, Captain
Forrest, is working at Caulfield Military
Hospital for the present. They all hail
from Charters Towers. Mrs. Forrest’s sis-
ter is married to the fighting Dr. Huxtable
who was lately D.S.O.’d.
From a soldier brother, now drearily con-
valescing in a French hospital. (He has
been on active service since Christmas,
15)14) :
I suppose this business must come to an end some
day, and maybe I shall sail into Port Melbourne
again, but I don’t, seem to realise the possibility.
Civil life seems so far off —a separate existence.
Those who have been out here a while sometimes
discuss “after the war” and the wonderful things
they will do when peace is declared. They don't
really mean it; they speak as small boys speak of
what they would do if they had a million pounds.
Shell-shock won’t knock over as many men as peace-
shock.
Lieut.-Colonel Angus Fraser, D. 5.0.. who
has just come back to Australia three
years abroad, is a son of Samuel Fraser,
who had charge of the Scotclibyterian flock
at Terang for many years. Colonel Fraser,
who won his decoration as a surgeon with
a Light Horse field-ambulance, returns in
company with another war-veteran —his
wife, who did hospital work while her Angus
was in the firing-line.
The Electrical Engineering School at the
Melbourne Uni. has a handsome war-record.
The only student to complete his course
during ill]7 was Fred. Ewart Moreton, who
is now a busy B.E.E. The other advanced
men are all at the Front. The new elec-
trical bachelor, who is a son of Dr.
Frederick Moreton, is an original Anzac.
having been one of the earliest ashore during
the Landing.
Miss Adelaide’s assortment: —
The hot January that Inclement Wragge promised
us arrived. Last week the thermometer bubbled well
over the century and reduced US’ all to pulp. A pro-
mised change at the week-end was fulfilled, but it
amounted only to a brief squall that flooded and
unroofed a house or two in the hills and made the
plains steam like a Turkish hath. If February is
going to be a repetition of January you will pro-
bably hear of the collapse of most of our patriotic
workers, because next month sees the renewal of
button days, carnivals, etc.
For 1918 the Vvar Council has adopted a new
method of settling the claims of rival societies for
dates. It has mapped the year’s programme and
allotted to each fund a consecutive fortnight or
month for its brigandage. The Soldiers’ Home
League at Fullarton leads off with the first fortnight
in February; then comes the Trench Comforts Fund
to end the month. In March there will be a War
Savings appeal, and for April the Returned Soldiers’
Association is arranging for a strenuous fortnight.
The Master of the Supreme Court, W. L. Stuart,
who is also president of the Rejected Volunteers’
Association, and was for some time in command of
the Mitcham Camp, is to fill the late Commissioner
Russell’s place on the Teachers’ Superannuation,
Fund. While he is busy with the Pethick Board of-
Inquiry (another offshoot of the land scandals in-
vestigations) his work at the court will be done by
E. M. Sabine.
Distinctions have come thick and fast to the
Swifts’ two sons at the Front. Three weeks after
their youngest son,, Neville, was awarded the Military
Cross came news of the same honor going to the
second son, Brian, who is a captain with the
R.A.M.C., and now the youngest boy has a bar to
Ms medal. The eldest son had the bad luck to be in
Germany when war broke out, and has been interned
in that devil-spawned country ever since.
Lady Galway is still at Victor Harbor, though she
put in a few days in town during the past week.
Ilis Ex. has gone to Melbourne to pass the time o’
day to the Munro-Fergusons.
Cpl. Pitts, a South Australian by adoption, who
before he enlisted was an A.B. on the Governor Mus-
grave, has escaped from Germany. He and another
Australian broke through the bars of their prison
windows, slid down a steel rope from the third;
storey, managed to get to Dusseldorf by train, and
then walked three nights to the frontier. Their
imprisonment dated from 1916.
There is to be at least one returned soldier
amongst the candidates at the State elections on
April 6 —Capt. Blackburn, V.C., who has been nomi-
nated by the. Nationalists for Sturt. Major Smeaton
stood down in his favor so that peace might prevail
between two factions. Also, we are to have at least
one woman candidate. She aspires to be one of the
members for Adelaide.
Something unusual and French happened at
Gawler when the wife of the retiring mayor at-
tended upon his successor to avenge a fancied in-
sult paid to her husband. Not being quite Parisian,
she did not shoot or rffhb his Worship; she merely
smacked his face hard. In Court a good deal was
made of an “open letter” put in the loeal paper by
the new mayor. It claimed that Gawler was
“approaching a state of things common in Tibet,
where the holy men abode outside the city, and
'lived on the bodies of the dead.” The Court said it
was satisfied that this mysterious insult referred to
the ex-mayor, and “admired any woman who upheld
her husband,” though it had no sympathy with the
assault. Claimed, £49; suggested as sufficient, Is.;
£3.
Rex Syme, the youthful editor and manager of
Adelaide Sunday Mail, has been congratulated by
his staff (with a few solid objects as a side-line)
on his marriage. Syme left the Register, with
Clarence Moody, to start the Mail, and on Moody’s
dropping out of the management, succeeded to it.
Our Returned Soldiers' Assoc, is to' have an
attractive home. The Repatriation Minister has made
a deal for a place in Grenfell-street, now occupied
by Dalgety’s, who are building in Currie-street and
will move there about next dune. The Government
has undertaken to pay £750 a year for five years,
plus rates, insurance and repairs. But “no liquor,”
says the Minister; “and no politics.” What are
politics, though? For instance, does this mean that
the assoc, isn’t to squeal no matter how badly its
members are treated?
Big Bill Baillieu’s second daughter, Bertie,
has agreed to risk it with Bob Ramsay, son
of the Brighton Ramsays. Their engage-
ment is just announced. He is a Royal Field
Artillery lieutenant, who has been gassed
and wounded on land and torpedoed—in the
Mongolia—at sea.
The sporting Miss Creswick, of Yarrien, is
linking up with Dr. Martin. To equalise
this and the Ramsay-Baillieu engagement
on the society card, the remaining daughter
of an impressive-looking Toorak widow has
scratched with the returned soldier of Scotch
parentage; and the buxom, fair and popu-
lar daughter of a lately-deceased Banana-
land squatter has discarded her naval fiance.
Two Melbonrnites will marry two
Bananalanders in March.. Both weddings
are booked for the Grammar School chapel.
Gwen Warnock weds with young Wharton,
son of mining-man Wharton, and will be
carried away by her bridegroom to Clon-
curry. Nan O’Hara is the other bride;
her home also will lie in the far North, but
very close to sister Mrs. nowan. Name of
Nan’s bridegroom? Good gracious, I’ve for-
gotten it 1
Benedict Michael Ivlatchko, the handsome
Russian doctor, sends a humorous word of
warning from a Japanese boat outward
bound. “Never marry a lady with a big
trousseau.” he writes. “The roomy cabins
of this ship are sufficient for my Billie and
her boxes, but not for me and my big black
boots. Such a life!” Ivlatchko married'
Billie, daughter of iron merchant Duckett.
The lovesick bridegroom, with his metaphors
rather mixed, adds that his sweet little
wattle-blossom will try her wings in Japan
before settling down in Russia. But can
anyone settle down in Russia? Or perhaps
it’s easier to settle down than settle up.
A girl-friend back from Sydney says she
saw Norah Dantoine’s twins and found them
very nice pink babies. Mrs. Dantoine was
one of the squatting Fields, of the Apple
Island, before she married one of Melbourne's
best-looking bachelors. Norah yearned to
possess a girl baby, but her patriotic con-
science hoped for a boy ; so Providence sent
her mixed twins.
The newlywed Winter-living pair have
lied to the Apple Isle for their honeymoon.
The bridegroom’s Military Cross announce-
ment got here the Very week of the wending.
This flying Captain is suffering from shat-
tered nerves. Matrimony seems to be the
fashionable cure for nerve-shatter.
The excellent Pimple Cross Service of
Victoria, which latterly has been somewhat
neglected by the public, has been making
another attempt to rake in funds. What the
Red Cross does for the soldier the Purple
Cross does for the warlnrse; but it can’t be
done without cash. Wherefore the manage-
ment has been reaching out into the country.
A “patriotic carnival” has been held at
Dandenong, a big-stock centre where the
Montgomery sisters helped to put the Purple
Cross girls through their capers, while some-
where in the background, calm but persist-
ent, the Purple Cross "ioneer. Maud Harvie,
attended to the labelling of the bags of coin
for dispatch to the service abroad.
Red Cross workers in Melbourne are re-
marking that the wives of politicians in
general, and of one politician in particular,
are no longer figuring prominently in the
monotonous business. You see, the State
election is just over, and the danger of an
early Federal election seems past. It’s a
nice’ degrading business, this politics.
Regarding the thickness of the German
national skin, here is a yarn from an up-
country health resort. Two Melbourne girls,
staying at the principal boarding-house,
were pestered by the companionship of a
young German. If they evaded him on the
premises they were bound to find him on the
verandah, watching for their out-going. The
young girls have "boys” and brothers at the
war, so the pertinacious attentions of the
enemy alien hurt them. But snubbing was
wasted on the smiling bounder. Their
endeavors to get him to take a hint were a
failure every time. Then they carried their
grievance to a tall, heavyweight Melbourne
solicitor who was rusticating at the house.
The German person was spoiling their holi-
day, they said, and if they couldn’t shake
him off they were going back to town at
once. The verv smirk of him made them
sick. The huge man-of-law went along to
the German person and told him to stop his
persecution at once or have his head knocked
off; and then, for the first time, the young
nuisance understood that he was not popular
with the fair sex. His hide was penetrated.
The threat of personal violence did it.
On Satuiday night Lois and Cacialli
began a series of operatic concerts at the
Town Hall. Melbourne, grilling and stew-
ing in sweltering heat, could not send a
good house. It was the city’s bad luck, for
the artists were in fine form. Lois especially
was in tremendous voice and very fit after
his successful eye operation. Dr. Ryan sat
proudly in the front rows and gazed on the
case he had saved from blindness. Lois
excitedly noticed him, and also signalled the
beloved matron of the hospital and his pet
nurse. Mrs. Pohlman motored up from her
seaside place. She wore filmy black lace
and some diamonds. Mrs. Lois showed a
long swan-like neck out of a sea-green dress.
Gertrude Johnson, a Melbourne operatic
artist who has been touring Bananaland,
gave extracts from some little-known things
by Donizetti. Her dress was amber-colored
tulle, and she wore diamond earrings and a
gilt laurel-wreath on her hair. Elsie Davies,
working wonders with lyric opera, was an
astounding presence. She wore a cap and
chin-strap of pearls, a breastplate of dia-
monds and a white satin gown with a top
decoration of pearl strings. If the pearls
had been real, some brave bushranger would
have abducted the large singer and floated
her into a company. Ann Williams, show-
ing smart fawn ankles under a black glacd
spread of skirt, was another decorative item
on the platform. Lois was groomed to per-
fection as usual. Cacialli wore gorgeous
waistcoat buttons and had his coat braced
across his chest with straps—possibly to
save his garments in the stress of the deep
lower notes. The season goes on at intervals
during the fortnight, and the programmes
are worth stewing for.
On the first-night of “Winnie Brooke,
Widow,” at the Tivoli. Ada Reeve somehow
contrived to look fresh and cool. Dr. Mar-
garet McLorinan was with a party in the
front row of the circle, and Major Charley
Cunningham, lately back from London, put
in an appearance. A bunch of returned
soldiers in the stalls gave Anzac Ada the
reception she deserved. But the beaches
were calling, and there were many vacant
pens.
Some Melbourne girls are fussing over
the Hawaiian men of the Muriel Starr eo.
in the same mad way as they rushed the
Fijians. They take them for motor-rides
and tea-parties, and generally sit at the
feet of the brown visitors.
Authoress Kathleen Dearden is down
from Bananaland looking for a cool spot
to rest in. She has with her an IS-year-
old son who is so terribly Stage-struck
that he would even take tickets at the door,
so as to be in the “atmosphere.” This
comes of having a brilliant mother who
writes plays. Young Charles has some-
thing to work on ; he gained a good deal of
approving comment with his amateur
theatrical work in Brisbane.
Bert Bailey is beginning to pick up his
shattered health again. He suffered simul-
taneously from gastritis, lumbago and ten-
shows-a-week—and the worst of them was
ten-shows. He is somewhat thinner now,
but almost as cheerful as ever. As a panto,
dame he wins the envious admiration of
the woman because of his neat footwear and
ankles. His outfits are weird but exquisitely
fitted.
Incidentally, there’s a riddle going around.
If Bert Bailey, a hardened, mature man,
breaks down under the unaccustomed strain
of 10 panto, shows a week, how much good
do 10 panto, shows a week do the growing
youngsters of a children’s panto.?
Yours sincerely.
JOHANNA.

ABORIGIN-
ALITES
“F.Y.7”: “Ses” need not worry —the
carpet-snake is not disappearing from our midst,
but is flourishing in the land. Likewise, far from
being restricted to a narrow strip of Ihe East Coast,
it is found all over the west, particularly in forest
country, where its bosom friend and chief ort,
the ’possum, has his habitat. “Ses” is right in
commending it as a ratter. The Graziers’ Butcher-
ing Co. had a big carpet for years in its skin
store in South Brisbane, and curious visitors were
often taken to inspect it w’hile it was sleeping
curled up on the roof beams. Billy Hancock, who
6onie years ago ran a store at Tamata, on the Gira
(New Guinea) goldfield, had a carpet, and fre-
quently got into trouble with miners who happened
to come on the streak unexpectedly. Like “Ses’s”
friend who wallowed in the milk vat, this fellow
had a passion for cow-juice, but preferred it
well mixed with rum. This led to it occasionally
seeing imaginary human beings, with distressing
results. The poor thing's end was a shocking one.
It woke up in the night with a fearful thirst and
making its way to the bar coiled itself about a
bottle of rum with the idea of constricting it.
Unhappily, owing to the state of its nerves, it over-
did it, with the result that Bilty found it in the
morning cut into neat sections by the broken glass.
Billy’s native carriers, who held the serpent in
great esteem, despite its failings, wept bitterly at
its funeral—which was also their breakfast.
“Karee”: “S. S. Severn’’ (B. 20/12/’l7)
says that pourri-pourri' exists in England. Ireland’s
got her share, and so has Brittany, where “charms”
are sold for many things, and there is a practice
savoring of “pointing the bone.” Should you wish
to get rid of an enemy, you give the sorcerer a piece
of his clothing, hair or nails, which he’ll affix-to a
wax doll, duly christened in the enemy’s name. A
fortnight after the doll will be stabbed, and your
friend will go west suddenly. Should you prefer for
him a lingering death the doll is slowly melted in
the sun. I saw a woman in Bejgium rush out when
a mob of sheep was passing and bump her scared
four-year-old on the back of the jumbucks as fast as
she could before they scattered. To the outraged
shepherd, wh'o pointed out the error of her ways in a
firework of ( Flemish expletives, she replied that it
was a sure way of preventing croup, and I have no
reason for doubting her veracity, though she did
charge me two francs for one “eggs-cook.”
“Jimmie Pannikin": What’s the best time
to get playtpus skins? Most of the Muddybiclgee
whalers, hunters and fishers with whom I discussed
the matter held that, “of course, winter is the time
to get furs of any kind” ; but the men of the abo.
station at Brungle, very keen hunters and fishers,
contended just as strongly that, though winter was
the time when most furs were at their best, the
platypus’s coat is an exception. It is in its finest
condition, they said, during the summer months.
For myself, I obtained skins both during summer and
winter and found little difference in the quality of
the fur.
* * * *
“Pick”: “Wart” (B. 3/l/’3S). in quoting
from Surveyor Hodgkinson, opines that the latter,
in referring to “bush biscuit,” had never heard of
damper. “Wart” is on the wrong spoor. The
flat cakes baked on the coals are, to the polite,
known as johnny-cakes; bushmen know them better
by a name that a religious paper wouldn’t print.
Damper is a loaf of unleavened bread, cooked in the
ashes. Johnny-cake is the hurried expedient of
the breadless wayfarer on trek ; damper the more
leisurely preparation of the established camp.
SCIENTIFIC ADJUSTMENT.
JONESIE: "'Ow is it yer Jive a beer, then a
gin, then a beer, then a gin, and keep it
goin' like that?”
BROWNIE: “ Well, ole man, if I stick to beer
I git fall before I'm shirk, an’ if I stick
to yin Cm shick before I'm full.
THIS way I yet shick and full at the
same time!"
“Cocky-tjuack” : Send “Jimmie Pannikin”
to the bottom of the class for his foolish disserta-
tion on gillbirds (B. 3/l/’18). 1 am ready to admit
tiiat the honeysucker’s- usual complaint is as raucous
as the voice of Ikey proclaiming the odds, but the
fowl has another tune for eisteddfodau. It com-
mences with a high, sweet, prolonged whistle, fol-
lowed by notes descending in pitch. The call would,
m a competition, lose anything that the leatherhead
has in his repertoire, and is no doubt the one
applauded by “Bunyip” recently.
MEASURE FOR MEASURE.
"Who are those two actor-fellows glaring at one another!”
"One's Hamfat Bumlet, the film-actor; the other chap’s got 94 yards more film than
Ham. in ‘The Doomed Sundowner, or a Life's Revenge.’”
“McNorth”: A Papuan planter had a
thousand-gallon galvanised-iron tank made and landed
on the beach nearest his place. There were 15 miles
of bush-track between the plantation and the sea, and
no vehicles, and as the tank was too bulky to be
carried on poles the planter was puzzled. At last
he sent a gang of niggers and told them to do the
best they could. Those coons rose to the occasion.
Two of their number roughly cleared the track of
bushes and other obstructions, and the mob rolled
the tank along the ground. At
the end of a week it arrived little
the worse for its bumpy journey.
Some years ago half a dozen abos.
carried a 10ft. dinghy through the
bush from Cape York to the spot
where the telegraph-line crosses
the .Tardine River. Distance,
30-odd miles; time, five days. A
traction-engine attached to a pair
of loaded waggons got caught by
a phenomenally early wet season
in the Gulf country. There were
20 miles of greasy mud ahead and
a flooded river astern. The boss
didn’t want to camp there for
three or four months till the end
of the wet, so he made a shot at
getting out. As the engine’s
wheels would not grip in the mud
he fastened the winding-rope
which is attached to all such
craft to a tree ahead and set the
winding-gear going. The engine
slowly dragged its lumbering self
up to the tree. The waggons were
■ then hooked on to the rope and
brought up to the engine. Then
the rope was taken ahead again
and the whole manoeuvre repeated ad inf. The boss
reckoned that 20 miles the longest he ever covered.
It took a month.

“C. direction”: The egg-mines of
“xMcNorth” at Cape York (B. 3/1 /’ 1S) are all very
well for bloated proprietors of Binghis ; but there is
too much uncertainty about the fowl-berry mined
from the scrub-hen’s dump. This scribe prefers,
when the egg-madness comes upon him, to make for
one of the reef-islets north of Cooktown, Two Isles
for example, about August. Eggs there outcrop on
the surface, so that the trouble of putting down a
shaft is saved. The only tools needed are a twig
broom and a bucket. Selecting a well-egged area in
the low scrub, the ground is swept clear for a space
corresponding to Jthe appetite. This is best done in
the afternoon when the birds are away fishing. Next
morning another call allows the outcrop to be col-
lected, all fresli and ready for the ' pot, and the
ground is prepared for the next day. The genuine
egg-enthusiast can fill in the weary hours of waiting,
on the first night, by selecting likely samples and
examining them over a candle in a kerosene-tin until
he has enough for supper.
“Barcoo”: “McNorth’s” black gin’s catch
of 48 scrub-turkeys’ eggs in a day’s forage in
North Queensland (B. 3/1/78) isn’t much com-
pared with what can be done around Lakes Galilee
and Buchanan. The former is one of Australia’s
sanctuaries for waterfowl of every description, from
the black swan to the insignificant dab-chick. It is
90 miles in circumference; and in the reeds and
undergrowth which go right round it the fowl-fruit
is deposited in uncountable quantities. The locality
is periodically visited by kangaroo-shooters and
selectors, accompanied by numerous empty petrol
tins, some mutton fat and coarse salt. The eggs
are smeared with the dripping, packed in layers in
the tins and covered with the salt. In this way the
spoil will keep for 12 months at least. Dozens of

JACK VALIANT.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
Jack Valiant’s left the ring at last —
Through forty years he fought unshamed.
The stress is o’er, the struggle past—
Jack Valiant stands with soul untamed.
The odds were great, yet great his will ;
And evermore, though sent to ground,
lie beat the count, and, smiling still,
Came back to fight another round.
Gaunt Drought and Ruin, savage foes,
Through year and year with brutal power
Beat down his guard, blows thick on blows;
And yet he did not cringe nor cower.
«
A hero he; no wise akin
To those whose deeds are cried aloud—
The petty mannikins who win
The plaudits of the gaping crowd.
He met such odds as well might break
A lesser strength with iron nerve,
Watched over by the gods who take
Account of those who truly serve.
A fighter and a builder too !
Beside his life-work, sure and sound,
How stand the windy, wordy crew
Who make a mountain of a mound !
As boy and man he tamed and hewed
The tree, the rock, the stubborn soil,
And every dawn beheld renewed
His life of stern and searing toil.
Afar from city lights withdrawn
He chose his ground and made his fight;
The sunset knew him and the dawn,
The midnight and the stars of night.
Day in day out, in glow and gloom,
He strove as slaves and heroes strive—
Dug dams to make the desert bloom,
Made grass to grow and flocks to thrive;
Built fences, miles and miles of fence ;
Rode leagues and leagues of route and track,
Green dawn at hand, or noon intense,
With stirless heat, or midnight black.
Hot days and breathless nights he knew,
Red realms that ached and ached for rain,
Where duststorms, blotting out the blue,
Fierce-scourged the landscape, ridge and plain
And many times, his pastures parched,
With praying lips and yearning eyes
He watched, while cloud-battalions marched,
A rainless host, across the skies.
And many times false mirage-gleams
Shone like the hopes of youth and age—
Far lures, far fantasies, far dreams
That drew him on from stage to stage.
And many times rough-riding Fate
With iron jaws and brows of strife,
And nostrils breathing smoke of hate,
Came thundering down his track of life.
And yet, withal, his heart was such
That, ste.el at times, at times light air,
It yielded straightway to the touch
Of Pity and the cry of Care.
Ah, nights of sweetness and of calm,
Wide nights of gloom and starry thrall,
The earth outbreatliing cooling balm—
Jack Valiant, how you loved them all!
And how you loved the song, the jest,
The lifted glass, the toast, the prank,
The mirth and play that kept the West,
With all its cares, so glad and frank 1
For years that sought to bow and bend
May gracious years of peace atone !
For you, Jack Valiant, were my friend,
My country’s friend, her very own !
True pioneer, you served her true —-
Gave all you had, your strength, your years,
To make her great; and great are you,
And great are all her pioneers!
And though the lights no longer glow
Around the ring, where all is night
Corona, Netlev, Momba know
The fine endurance of your fight!

That will depend mainly on the lubricating oil

Motor-wear is not accidental. It results from friction.
Excessive friction is bound to follow the use of an

whose quality is of a low lubricating efficiency.
Motors differ.
No short-cut method can determine the oil best suited
to your feed requirements.
The construction of your motor must be analysed and
carefully considered.

Dear Sir. —When I
returned to Australia
from active service
abroad I was in-
formed that, in addi-
tion to the other in-
juries I had sus-
tained, my nerves
had been affected by
the strenuous condi-
tions under which
I had worked at the
front, and by the fact
that I had been so
constantly in the
midst of the roar of
our own puns and
had so frequently
been subjected to the
bursting of enemy
shells about me. Hav-
ing. previous to my
enlistment, had ex-
perience of the good-
ness of your Heenzo
for colds and sore
throats. I deemed it
advisable to try a
course of Hean’s
Tonic Nerve Nuts for
m.v nerves, before
taking on an aerial voyage, as I did not feel quite as I should,like to. I had only been
taking them a few days when the benefit of their influence became apparent, and I felt
that 1 was getting into m.v usual stride for air-work, and when I made my first balloon
ascent, since returning from France 1 had every confidence in myself. As I rose above
►Sydney I was in my full aerial skill, and though not fully fit physically for other
work I enjoved the exhilaration of being up in the region of the birds, and was glad
to know that I could again undertake aerial engagements, thanks to Hean's Tonic
Nerve Nuts. With appreciation, I remain, yours truly.

“P. Winkle”: After a long spell (about
seven years) locusts are again devastating the green
grass areas of Northern Vic. Where do the pests
come from ? Do their eggs take seven years to
hatch out ? Round Lake Cooper trees and stumps
are covered with sheaths from which the devastators
emerged to attack the settlers’ patches. I always
thought that locusts laid their eggs in tlTe earth.
Anyhow, there is no doubt about their appetite. A
mob stripped a 20-acre paddock of lucerne in a day
at Nanneella, close to the Mallee-Waronga channel,
which they crossed. The same paddock carried
about 40 head of stock for three months without
showing any diminution of growth. A paddock of
similar extent adjoining was saved from the
invaders by being flooded.
* * * *
“Bill R.”: When the Abo.-quacks have
written their prescriptions for treating a dog with
a tick, let me remark that all will be futile if the
animal is allowed a sun-bath. I had assisted many
valued tykes to their happy hunting-grounds by
administering unto them the so-called unfailing
specifics until an Irish setter of mine that had
been missing for 10 days crawled out of an aban-
doned miner’s tunnel in the convalescent stage
after tick fever. I gave the poor fellow a drink
and drove him back into the dampness and shade.
He recovered. Since then I have cured many dogs
and cats by simply pulling off the ticks and keeping
the patient on wet bags in a dark place. Feeding or
lying in the sun is invariably fatal.
* * * *
“Machete”: “ Jas. Hyde,” in a recent
Bulletin, says he never heard of cannibalism among
Queensland blacks south of the Johnstone River
(N.Q.). It seems to have been pretty common, all
the same. Stewart Russell, in his “Genesis of
Queensland,” a standard work on the early days
of the State, mentions it as being a regular feature
at the great meetings of the darkies of
South Queensland at the Bunya Mountains on the
Darling Downs. Every four years, when the Bunya
nuts ripened, the tribes laid aside their old feuds
and met in a sort of truce. They feasted fat on the
nuts, and, according to Russell, included human flesh,
usually that of old and infirm people, in the menu.
In the North, of course, the practice was general.
Late Chief Inspector Douglas, of the Native Police,
had many a yarn about the cannibal propensities
of the Palmer blacks. But I doubt if any Aus-
tralian abo. ever ate his brother man in the fashion
of the Papuan cannibal, who was (and is) accus-
tomed to look on his brother as kai first and man
afterwards.
HIS CONTRIBUTION.
“ Ain't that ’ulkin’ feller doin’ no work yet?
Don’t ’e even ’elp yon at ’ome?"
“Well, ’e cleans out the cupboard.”
“Merrigal”: The Too demolishers cited by
“45/90” (B. 3/l/’18) were evidently hot pots, but
Frank Pressy, a Riverina product, and his wife and
two others named Bannerman composed a gang
that had little to learn. Of 22,000 longtails accounted
for at Buttabone station (Warren, N.S.W.) in one
year in the ’eighties, by yarding and shooting, more
than 12,000 answered to their guns. They used
treble F black powder, behind BB shot. They drove
their quarry into a corner of any paddock and
downed them as they broke back. At stripping the
jackets Pressy was a blitherer. He could average
one a minute all day, and once he knocked the boss
of the station bandy by removing a blue flier’s pelt
in 16 seconds. He was a topper with any sort of
shooting-stick, and several times have I seen him
shy two cartridge-cases skywards and well apart, fall
on his back and get one with each barrel. The
boss mentioned was also handy with a musket. I
saw his eight consecutive bullets stop an octave
of grunters ambling across a plain—that was the
day he and Barry, of Benah station, Canonbar
(N.S.W.), shot 212 ’roos with the rifle. By the way,
who knows a better one-day kangaroo drive than
the 9000 got at Trinkey, Warialda district (N.S.W.),
some 30 years ago ?
" » » »
“Snell”: I went to Pibrock for my
Christmas debauch of fresh air, rest and recuperation,
and stayed with the Canty family. In the course of
social peregrinations I fell in with the Holts, a mild
little man and a mild little wife, and was told
later that no one could be a friend of the Holts who
abided with the Canties. “We’re not speakin’ nor
doalin’,” said old man Canty. “When the Holts
got married and came here they set to work ’n’
poisoned two of the best cow dogs man ever had.
They said the dogs was savage, ’n’ swore in court
that the dogs ’d worry their dear little baby.” “And
did the dogs ever offer to touch their baby?” I
asked. “That’s 20 years ago,” Canty replied, “ ’n’
they haven’t had a baby yet.”
**• * *
“J.G.”: Not all circus riders are such
mugs at riding buckjumpers as “S.S.” (B. 3/l/’18)
tries to make out. At a horse-sale at Ballarat about
25 years ago a fine-looking bay prad was led into
the ring, and in a few minutes he proved to be the
primest bucker ever I have seen in action. All the
hard-case riders about Ballarat were sent for rocket-
flights ; but he found his boss in a little foreign
circus-rider, who stuck to him long after the saddle
had gone. Then the showman made the outlaw fly
the gate, took him for a trip round two or three of
the centre blocks of the city, hopped him over the
gate again and re-entered the ring.
* * * *
“Te Whare”: A boss destroyer of the
pond-snail (host of the liver-fluke, abhorred of
mutton merchants) is the straw-necked ibis, which
, occurs about inland marshes and surface
pools of the south and west of N. S.
Wales in immense flocks. Of course, the
white ibis and the glossy ibis help, but
both these birds are rare, the glossy
variety especially so. The three species
are nomadic in habits, appearing occasion-
ally in unexpected quarters. Writer has
only once seen the white ibis on
the Monaro (N.S.W.) plains, but
the straw-necked species comes
ocasionally in wet seasons. The
solemn birds stand in small com-
panies around springs on the
black-soil plains, probing the soft
mud with their long sickle bills
in quest of yabbies and
water insects, or hunting
around in damp grass for
snails. They never breed
on the Monaro highlands,
but out west the untidy
stick nests, built on swamp
gums and other small tim-
ber, occur literally in
“rookeries,” and the beau-
tiful greenish-blue eggs—
very elongated and rounded
at the ends —may be gath-
ered by the bushel. Pass-
ing coastwards over the
ranges the straw-necked ibis sometimes
reaches the flats in the Bega district in
fair-sized flocks, abides there perhaps for
two or three months, and again wings its
way westward. The ibis travelling formation is
peculiar. The birds fly head to head in one long,
wavering line, extending for many yards across the
sky; black swans, on the other hand, fly in two
lines in angle, the apex of which is the leading swan.
* * * *
“Kila” : Which is the largest sheep-station
in Australia —I mean the one that shears the greatest
number of sheep ? Away back in the ’eighties
Brookong tN.S.W.) had a board of 104 at shearing
time, and as about three men are required to each
shearer this meant a little township. I know that
amongst the fraternity Brookong was reckoned to
be the boss shed out back. I fancy that famous
Kilfera, near Clare, ran it a good second,' with 100
shearers. But the bunny has put the kybosh on the
old-time glory. I know of one station near the
Murray that had 80,000 sheep before he appeared;
now it is down to 30,000. Besides the rabbit, over-
stocking did a lot of harm. In many places the
saltbush, that famous old standby, has vanished.
Some paddocks that were masses of cotton bush and
other edible scrub are now as bare as the N.S.W.
Treasury. I don’t think they will ever recover, either.
A FOUNDATION OF LAW.
EXCITED OLD PARTY: “Help! Help! Call the police! Where’s the police?"
BYSTANDER: “Get out, per ole goat—the police is underneath!"
“Edward Barbor” : We’ve had it out about
strange places for birds to camp; now what about
the queerest place for bees to nest? At the Balook
(Vic.) post office a swarm lately took possession of
the letter-box, and are now busy preparing comb.
The postmistress intimates that anyone may have
the lot as a going concern on application.
* * * *
“S.L.E.W.”: Passing through Linville
(Q.) I dropped into a pub. On a table were two
deer-heads with full-grown antlers. These antlers
were so firmly interlocked that to separate them
without breaking them was impossible. They told
their own tale. The stags had fought for a bride,
and, their main weapons becoming linked, the antago-
nists lay down together and gave up the ghost. Thus
they were found by a bullpcky in the scrub. Deer
are very plentiful among the hills of the Brisbane
River Valley.
“Hoplocephalus” : Without desiring to east
any slur on Arizona (B. 3/l/’18), a hair rope, not
a tarred one, was the orthodox snake-repeller in
Texas in the good old days of no fences and cheap
cartridges, celebrated in the pictures. The rattler,
provided that "he was a real rattler and not a pro-
duct of boot-leg whisky, was supposed to be too
annoyed by the hairs getting under his belly scales
as he crossed to recollect his intention of biting the
sleeper.
* * * *
“Hard-up, Esq.” : Squatters by destroying
timber near water are helping to increase the
blowfly pest. No tree should be allowed to be cut
or ringbarked within three miles of the bank of any
stream, because in hot weather if there is green tim-
ber near water the flies collect upon it during the day
and don’t trouble the sheep. The jumbucks, as a rule,
keep right away from the trees during the heat.
Planting belts of shade trees will further help to
defeat the fly curse. It was a terrible mistake to
whack down the big gums near the Murray. Here’s
another thing. Why isn’t proper investigation given
to the tiger-fly ? It is a deadly enemy to other flies,
including the “blow,” which is making such big
trouble for the squatter.
“Fanuela”: A farmer argued into my
attentive ear that sheep generally feed with their
rear-ends to the breeze and that cattle generally face
it. Always understood that the reverse was correct.
Anyway, whichever it is, why is it?
* * * *
“H.V.E.” : It is through no fault of any
wild bird that its species shows a declining birth-
rate. If the first clutch of eggs or nestlings comes
to grief the pair lose no time in building another
nest, and the female produces the nucleus of another
brood. A pair of white-shafted fantails .(“cranky
fan”) plastered their ethereal wineglass-shaped nest
this season on the low twig of a laurel bush. Chicks
arrived in due course, but a laughing-jack (I think)
scoffed the lot. The fans promptly built again in
another laurel bush a few yards distant from the
first. Three eggs hatched out safely, and the chicks
qualified for the flying corps. But the morning fol-
lowing my last inspection I found two lying dead
beneath the nest, one with a crushed skull and the
other with a broken neck. The third chick escaped
injury and flew about with its parents. Still these
fantails are not satisfied. They are determined to
deliver the full quota of goods, and have built a
third time, in the same bush. (The second nest, by
the way, swarmed with lice.) The same thing hap-
pens if the nest and eggs are destroyed in exception-
ally heavy rains, or the nestlings drowned. The
yellow-throated scrub-wren (“devil-bird”) hangs its
enormous nest from the twigs of sassafras and wild-
willow about secluded coastal gullies- If heavy rain
comes the nest gets soaked through, breaks its cob-
web attachment and falls to the ground. But the
devils either build a new or renovate an old nest —
the latter a habit of theirs. I have found the nest of
this bird with eggs as late in the season as the
middle of May.

“Jwosp”: L. Villa recently shore 343
sheep in a busy day at a Southland (M.L.) shed, and
the Maoriland record is claimed for him. The pre-

whereas Villa’s lot were heavy sheep.

View of Jetty and
Dunlop Conveyor "Belt
at Hummock Hill, S.A .
This is the loading Station
at Which ore .{brought doWn from
Iron Knob Mine, 34 miles distant) is
shipped by steamer to Newcastle, N.S.W.
In all big Industries the question
of economic handling of huge
quantities of material is of vital
importance. In this direction the
use of Dunlop Conveyor Belting
saves money, labour and time.
The shipping of iron ore at Hummock Hill
(S.A.) is a case in point. Here an extensive
system of Dunlop Conveyor Belts (some 5,464
feet in length) carry ore at the rate of 1,000
tons per hour, and fill a steamer in almost
as many hours as it took days BEFORE ITS
INSTALLATION. The cost of such handling
is reduced to the minimum, and owing to the
durability of the Dunlop Belts the upkeep
is infinitesimal when compared to the work
lone. THE INSTALLATION IS A COM-j
PLETE SUCCESS, AND MORE DUNLOP
BELTS HAVE SINCE BEEN ORDERED.
Dunlop Conveyor Service pays in Econ-
omy and pays in Satisfaction.' When you
have a Belting proposition shall be
pleased to quote and
submit samples, also
facts that prove the
undoubted superiority of
Dunlop Belts for hard ser
vice under all conditions.

Over 30 tons of Dunlop Conveyor Belting is already doing good work at the Broken Hill
Propty. Co.’s plant at Hummock Hill, and two move huge Conveyor Belts have just been
® to their order for use at the same place. The illustration depicts one of them—it is
820 ft. long, 36 in. wifle, % in. thick and weighs 4 'A tons. The other belt is 1,120 ft. long
with a width of 26 in., and weighs about the same as the one illustrated.


Do Your Meals Fit?
Did your last meal taste deliciously good to you,
and did you eat all you wanted? Could you
have patted your rotundity in glee and felt
proud of your appetite and of your good, strong
stomach? Do you feel rosy now because your
last meal gave you no inconvenience whatever?
If not, you have Dyspepsia in some form, and
probably never realised it.
If you have the least trouble in your stomach
after eating, no matter how little or how much
you eat, there is trouble brewing, and you must
correct it at once.
Most all stomach troubles come from poor,
weak, scanty gastric juice, that precious liquid
which ought to turn your food into rich, red
blood.
If you have Nausea, your gastric juice is weak.
If you have sour risings or belchings, your
food is fermenting; your gastric juice is weak.
If you have loss of appetite, your gastric juice
is weak. If you have a bloaty feeling of aver-
sion to food, your gastric juice is weak.
You need something in your stomach to supply
the gastric juice which is scanty, and to give
power to the weak gastric juice. Dr. Sheldon’s
Digestive Tabules do this very thing.
Bo you fed snug and comfortable
around your waist-line after a
hearty meal ?

Now, think, one grain of one of the ingredients
of these wonderful little tabules digests 3000
grains of food. They are several times more
powerful than the gastric juice in a good,
strong, powerful stomach. They actually
digest your food for you. Besides, they increase
the flow of gastric juice—just what you need
to get all the good possible out of everything
you eat. You will never have that “lump of
lead” in your stomach nor any other stomach
trouble after taking Dr. Sheldon’s Digestive
Tabules. Then everything you eat will be
digested; they will give you strength, vim,
energy and a rosy disposition. You’ll feel good
all round your waist-line after every meal, and
they will make you feel good all over.
Dr. Sheldon’s Digestive Tabules will make
you feel happy after eating a good hearty meal.
Take one or two after eating. You’ll feel fine,
then your meals will fit, no matter what or when
you eat. You should always have a tin of Dr.
Sheldon’s Digestive Tabules on .your dining-
table. They will make you get all the good
possible out of everything you eat, and you'll
enjoy it.
MaKe Your Stomach Strong' and Healthy
Dr. Sheldon’s Digestive Tabules are sold everywhere at 1/6 per tin of 36 Tabules, and 2/6 per tin of 80 Tabules. there wfflbe

Business, Robbery, etc.
“Cape Wollomai” : The mutton-bird (sooty
petrel) in November becomes Australia’s
champion egg-layer, and is responsible for
quite a flourishing industry in parts of
coastal Victoria and the Barrier and Fur-
neaux Groups in Bass Straits. The egg—
usually one per bird —is laid in a burrow in
the sandy soil, which extends for a good
many feet underground in some cases. The
birds arrive in immense flocks with the first
of the equinoctial gales—known locally as
“mutton-bird gales”—and proceed to clean
out the holes with great vigor. The mutton-
birder then takes his faithful hook, made
from a piece of doubled fencing-wire lashed
to a stick, and burgles the home. Usually he
gets the egg alone; sometimes the egg and an
indignant mother mutton-bird; sometimes
one or both of these and a snake; sometimes
the snake only; sometimes nothing at all.
The eggs at ordinary times are worth a bob
a dozen, and are largely bought by pastry-
cooks. There is a tale of an enthusiastic
poultry-fancier who bought a very cheap lot
of duck-eggs in November and incubated
out a fine family of sooty petrels. The
mutton-bird of commerce, beloved by the
more robust variety of late drunk, is the
young bird taken from the burrow, fried in
its own oil and packed in barrels. The
Straits Islander gets his light, his bedding
and most of his living from the mutton-bird ;
but the industry is being destroyed by pastur-
ing sheep on the rookeries.
“ivlurkah”: Some of P.M.G. Webster’s
telegraph regulations urgently require revi-
sion. For instance, why prohibit the use of
figures in the text of private messages? They
are permitted and largely used in M.L. and
U.S.A.: also they are used in railway tele-
grams, where correctness is very necessary.
Further, the convenience of figures is per-
mitted in Government telegrams. From the
public’s point of view the regulations re-
garding liability are outrageously unfair.
The addressee of a telegram, doubting the
correctness of the message, can get a repe-
tition thereof by paying the cost of two tele-
grams—one the official advice requesting the
repetitipn and the other the repetition itself.
Should, however, events prove that both the
original and the repeated copy were incorrect,
Article 34(5 of the current Postal Guide pro-
vides that “no responsibility shall be under-
taken nor any claim for compensation enter-
tained, for any errors or mistakes in trans-
mission or delay in delivery of telegrams,
whether repeated or unrepeated.... from
whatever cause” such hash-up may have re-
sulted. This reservation, be it noted, also
refers to the charges for transmission, though
a footnote to this article states that if,
through Departmental blunder, a message
has been rendered useless, “the P.M.G. may,
as an act of grace and not in consequence of
any legal liability, refund the amount paid
for transmission.”
“Tropical Druid”: Somebody was lately
holding forth on the goodness of tinned rab-
bit, and demanding that more of it be sent
to our troops in France. They can have it
all if it’s the same as is supplied to the
Pacific forces. Experience has shown that
if there is any hard yakker to be done rabbit
is no good unless helped out by a meat ration.
Many a time I have seen tins of it left on
the roadside by disillusioned patrol parties.
Even niggers sometimes refuse it. Brown
Brother calls it “meat belong pussy,” liis
only knowledge of bunny being got from the
labels.
* * * *
“Fax”: It is seemingly impossible to get
the Vic. State War Council to move in the
matter of a certain deficiency in the
accounts of the former sec. of one of the
soldiers’ comforts funds. From the outset
the excuse for hushing it up has been that
the shortage was only £5O, and that a prose-
cution would do the Cause more than £5O
worth of injury. 'This compounding of a
felony—if it was a felony—might have been
sound diplomacy had everybody kept silent.
But there seems to have been so much shrug-
ging of shoulders that the scandal has been
magnified; and, in consequence, action would
probably be taken now if it weren’t that
other people’s carelessness would be exposed.
“Carburetted Hydrogen” : The big Sydney
gas co. pleads that in the month when 22
tests out of 53 showed that it wasn’t giving
its customers full measure it was using-up
unsatisfactory strike-coal. No doubt the
Government will be bluffed; but it shouldn’t
be, because all the time there was in N. S.
Wales, and handy to Sydney, the finest gas-
enriching shale in the world. Why was it
not used? Scores of thousands of tons have
been exported to enrich the gas in German
towns, which paid more than four times the
price per ton that our gas pirates pay for
best gas-coal.
* * * . *
“F.C.” : The fact that an ejectment order
was lately granted in Melbourne against a
soldier’s wife who owed 20 weeks’ rent and
firmly declined to either pay or vacate the
premises, reminds me. Outside the suburb
of Oakleigh a citizen built a cottage on an
allotment he owned, lie bad got it all fin-
ished, and was tidying up one evening pre-
paratory to putting up a ‘‘To-let’’ notice,
when a casual person with a horse and cart
and a few duds occurred and asked if he
might camp there for a day or so—he was
travelling to GippslancT and his horse was
knocked up. The kindly cit. consented. A
week later he came along and found the
casual person comfortably installed, with a
wife, a daughter and two upstanding sons;
also a discourteous dog and a dozen fowls.
The cit. inquired about rent, but the other
failed to understand him. The casual person
had been allowed to occupy the house, and
nothing had been said about rent, and he
proposed to dwell there permanently. He
was a hefty man, with two hefty sons, so the
kindly citizen went to the law, and was
advised to remove the roof. He removed the
roof, luckily of iron, and the stranger
departed. Then the owner put the roof on
again. But nobody gets into that house
again without paying the first week’s rent in
advance.
* # * *
“Barcoo”: Last year when Clermont
(C.Q.) had been nearly blotted out by a
flood the survivors woke up. After years of
neglected warnings they started to shift
back from the death-trap on the lagoon to
the near-by high and dry ridge. The build-
ings that would stand the strain were re-
moved intact on rollers. In this way
Peterson’s pub, the Grand, wended its way
to its new resting place, taking a fortnight
to do the 880 yards, business being con-
tinued as usual right through the operation.
“A.M.J.” : Now that the Broken Hill Prop,
is installing rolls in the Newcastle Steel
Works for making steel plates, Australia has
a chance to start on building steel ships.
Even yet we don’t seem to have grasped the
fact that the earning power of a steel vessel
for several years after the war will more
than compensate for its present high cost.
While we were hanging round the pawnshop
door Japan was getting even busier than
usual in the ship-building line. In addition
to using the output of his own rolling mills,
Nippon was paying as much as 6d. per lb.
for Yankee plates delivered in Japan. Even
at this price his ship-plate imports increased
from 3275 tons in 1914 to 138,565 tons in the
first 10 months of 1917. Nippon is not keen
on importing, as the low figures for 1914
show, but he was sufficiently seized with the
wisdom of getting his ships on the water and
in among the big freights to buy what his
ever-increasing blast-furnaces couldn’t turn
out. What Australia has done in the same
time will not bear thinking about; but if
we gagged the politicians and got to work,
we might even yet have something more to
live on than Billjim’s reputation and the
blessing of Cohen.
“Copabella”: A Victorian metropolitan
shire notorious for its neglect of ordinary
sanitation was suddenly bitten with a desire
to administer the Pure Foods Act. It
therefore hauled to court a couple of very
petty traders who had been guilty of selling
cream of tartar that transgressed to the
extent of one part in 322500! Then it
rammed the lesson home by charging in its
“costs” Is. 9d. for the sample it had bought,
and which, after analysis, it did not return .
Nothing, of course, was done to the whole-
saler who supplied the widow. He might
have fought the case.
* * * *
“E..T.K.”: If F. W. Ledger, of Yarra-
wonga (Vic.), isn’t a good entry for the best
Australian odd-job man I’m content to lose
my deposit. Firstly, he is a hairdresser, and
is able to use the blade with either hand. He
makes a specialty of massage. He is a
chiropodist. He is a gardener. He can milk
cows with anyone in the business. In his
spare time lie goes in for pig-jobbing and
cattle-dealing. He is a tent and tarpaulin
maker, and supplies the local demand for
water-bags. All the waggon hammocks in
these parts and for miles around are manu-
factured by him. Itope-splicing is one of bis
fine arts. He runs the only jewellery estab-
lishment in the town, and mends watches
and clocks. As a judge of poultry and bees
his services are always in demand. He con-
trols a musical-instruments business, and, of
course, runs the usual tobacco emporium.
Finally, he is a strong temperance advocate.
• * * *
“Wandi” : I was in a store in Caboolture
one day when an aborigine, who was em-
ployed by a timber-getter, came in with a
slab of pine, three-feet long by a foot wide,
which lie dumped on the counter with the
explanation that it was a letter. On one
side of it was written in charcoal: “Please
send me one pound of tobacco and a tin of
golden syrup. Money enclosed. Yours truly,
Robert Breeze.” “Where’s the money ? ’ the
bearer was asked. “No money,” was the
answer. “Your boss says ‘money enclosed
here,” said the storekeeper tapping the char-
coaled lines. Muni repeated that no money
had sent; nothing, in fact, bad been
said to him about money. Surmising that
the boss had not trusted his boy, I care-
fully examined the slab, and in one end dis-
covered a plugged auger-hole. The slab was
split with an axe, and the enclosed cash, in
shillings, was revealed, to the amazement ot
the blackfellow who had brought it.
* * * *
“Snowy” : If Egypt is a “gift of tbe Nile, ’
the 30,000 acres of fat alluvial land about
Orbost (Vic.), which produces more maize,
pigs and pumpkins than any other equal area
i,. the world, is certainly a Christmas-box
from the Snowy River. The washings from
a hundred different kinds of soil have been
laid down in the old estuary to a depth of
no one knows how much, and the process is
still going on. There are places where three
fences, one on top of the other, have been
built in the last 30 years. The river has
buried the first in mud and then repeated the
process with the second, and an extra-big
flood or two have started to put a blanket
over the third.

[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
Foul eggs my giocer sent to me,
A pound of execrable tea.
(A man of good repute is he.)
The butcher to my home convoyed
A pound of steak, and I enjoyed
A hunk of changeless ruberoid.
(My butcher has a foremost perch
Among respectables at church ;
No rumors his good name besmirch.)
A dozen peaches next I had,
And they were dangerously bad.
(The fruiterer’s a worthy lad.)
1 paid good coin wool socks to get.
They're cotton. (To my great regret
The draper is looked up to yet.)
To each, some little thing to buy,
I gave a bad half-crown. Now I
In gaol for one whole year must lie!

LOSING YOUR NERVE.
Everybody has some store of nervous
energy. When work or worry without suffi-
cient rest exhausts this store, a condition
results that medical men call neurasthenia.
It is commonly met with in those who
have cared for sick relatives, and business-
men who worrv over their affairs and neg-
lect to take proper rest. Women who work
beyond their strength, anyone who has too
much excitement and too little rest may
show the symptoms.
The signs are clear. Your complexion
becomes pale, you imagine unpleasant
things, your brain insists on working when
you want to go to sleep. Sometimes you are
melancholy. Things that used to please you
no longei; do so. Constipation is usually
present. You worry about yourself and your
work and cannot forget your anxieties.
No doctor • can cure neurasthenia; you
have to do it yourself. First, worry less and
don’t overtax your strength ; then begin Dr.
Williams’ Pink Pills for pale people, for
they supply new blood to feed your worn-out
nerves and so steadily build up your health.
Never accept any substitute at shops.
The Dr. Williams’ Medicine Co., Box
594 G.P.0., Sydney, has published a free
book on nervous disorders that contains a
chapter on neurasthenia, in which the symp-
toms are fully described and the correct
treatment given.— Advt.

REMARKABLE HAIR GROWTH
FOLLOWS USE OF SIMPLE
FORMULA.
During the last few years a simple hair-
growing formula has appeared on several
occasions in leading publications, and has
aroused a great deal of interest, not only on
account of its simplicity and inexpensive-
ness, but also because of the remarkable
results so uniformly reported from its use.
Increased growths of from one to three
inches a month, disappearance of dandruff
in one to three days and the stopping of fall-
ing hair in the same time, making harsh,
dry, brittle hair soft, luxuriant and glossy,
etc., etc., are quite frequently reported. The
tonic is prepared from the following
formula : 3oz. bay rum, i drachm menthol
crystals, and loz. Lavona de Composee, and
we understand that the ingredients can be
obtained at small cost from practically all
chemists, many of whom have also arranged
to hold a stock of the complete preparation.
This is supplied in convenient sprinkler-
topped bottles, under the name of Lavona
Hair Tonic, and doubtless many readers will
prefer to obtain the hair tonic in this com-
plete form. — Advt.

POLITICAL
POINTS
The object of the Censorship is to keep
information from the enemy. The enemy is
any person who would vote against you if
lie knew the truth.
Last Commonwealth Parliament had a
majority in favor of Hughes going to the
Cold Country. This Parliament seems to
have a majority in favor of Hughes going to
the hottest place you can think of.
There are things like the report of the
commission of business men which was
appointed to inquire into the Defence i e-
partment administration that the Censorship
can’t very well deal with. But, thank
Heaven, in the interests of Muddle and
Inefficiency, there are still some pigeonholes
in the Department.
The Argus, realising that if a majority in
the Federal Legislature cast a dinkum vote
the Hughes Ministry would be tossed into
the garbage tin, calls upon the alleged
Nationalists to do nothing rash, lest the War
Precautions Act be not administered with
prudent restraint and raids be made on
Wealth. Ah, note we’re getting it. Hughes’s
job, then, is to Win the War for the Fat
Man ?
While we are demanding that German
colonies in the Pacific shall never go back
to the Hun, we might spare a yell or two
hi demand decent treatment of fhe terri-
tory we have in those parts. We are sup-
posed to be developing the tropical indus-
tries of Papua; yet, though Papua forms
part of the Commonwealth, the other part
exacts Customs duty on goods imported
from Papua. It is a weird way of giving
help—more like a big brother stealing the
baby’s pennies than anything else.
THE NEW ARRIVALS.
BILL AND JIM, JUN.: “KAMERAD!
KAMERAD!!”
Colonel Repington, London Times’ mili-
tary correspondent, nas left the paper be-
cause, he says, Northcliffe is “attacking”
some more generals. The impudence of!
those military people is sublime. They
muddle; they waste; they fail. But there
must me no criticism of their precious
actions. On the trumpery pretext that it
is bad for discipline, or that it will be
giving away something to the enemy, they
frame regulations making it an offence for
their employers, whose lives are in their
hands, to adversely comment on their admin-
istration. Seeing what the failure of in-
competents means to him, John Bull might
well thank God every morning that he has
got a Northcliffe big enough to attack this
cheekiest confidence trick of all times.
Putting the Bendigo pledge out of the
question, is there one single reason why
Australia should hang on to the Hughes
Government? Its most important job was
to get reinforcements. It has failed so
miserably that the country is disgraced;
and nearly every speaker at the conference
of recruiting agents in Sydney last week
declared that the failure was due to wretched
Defence Department administration. Its
handling of the finances has been shocking.
Its one piece of war-finance legislation is
the War-time Profits measure; and that is
HIS CHANCE—AND HERS.
HE : “Haw, with — er—my money and influ-
ence, y’ know, you could have all that
you desired.”
SHE: “Oh, really! Could it get you into the
army ?”
a weird jest, and is bound to be repealed.
Its handling of the wheat business lias been
a scandal; and, though there has been less
trouble over wool, every man in the busi-
ness knows that there has been muddling
there, too. It has simply piffled with the
subject of shipbuilding: who doesn’t believe
that if the whole thing had been handed
over to the Broken Hill Prop., for instance,
50 times more would have been done? Its
one definite performance has been the
appointment of a crowd of superfluous
Commonwealth police at. great expense when
Australia can’t afford to waste a penny,
and all because a hobbledehoy threw an egg'
at a politician.
Something which shows he can “think in
continents,” if necessary, is being done by
Vic.’s new Works Minister, McWhae. Most
Vic. politicians regard the
East Gippsland-Ma State
border as being at the back
o’ Beyond, and leave it at
that. However, Monaro is
only a few miles over the
dividing line, so McWhae
has agreed with N. S. Wales
to join up with Vic. by a
new 14-mile track from the
village over the border, con-
necting with the main East
Gippsland road, and capable
of carrying any sort of
traffic. Mac finds himself
in progressive company in
these negotiations, since J. D. Fitzgerald,
Minister for Local Government, is at the
N.S.W. end of the arrangement.
It was bound to come. The Argus calls
upon the country to loyally support Hughes
because he “undertook to reassume the bur-
den of administration at the request of the
Governor-General.” Also let no man, least
of all Tiie Argus, pass unfriendly remarks
about Ryan, of Queensland, for he. also
undertook the burden of administration at
the Governor’s request.
It transpires, almost as a matter of
course, that the recommendations which
Professor I.efroy, imported at considerable
expense, made re the murder of the weevil
in wheat : (he made them after three weeks’
study of local conditions) were almost
exactly the -same as those made by local
scientists more than a year ago. These
weren’t acted on, as a matter of course. It
is common enough for a prophet to have no
honor in his own country, but in Australia
the locally-grown prophet is lucky not to
get six months without the option.
Ryan, Nationalist M.L.A. for Essendon
(Vic.), who took Laborite Blackburn’s seat
at the State elections, nas not lost his con-
fidence in Ryan, Nationalist M.L.A. for
Essendon. Speaking at a Drowsy Sabbath
Afternoon in Wesley Church, he showed Aus-
tralia the way out of her industrial troubles.
It is quite easy. First you catch your
organised boss or employee.
Then, having proved him
guilty of a lock-out or a strike,
you proceed to improve him by
imposing penalties to meet the
case. These include disfran-
chisement, Federal, State and
municipal; also deregistration
for five years under the Com-
panies Act in the case of the
boss, and in the case of the
toiler exclusion from the bene-
fits of the Workmen’s Compen-
sation Act. Ryan seems deter-
mined to save his old Labor
pals from themselves, no mat-
ter what it costs them. He is
shortly to introduce an Indus-
trial Peace Bill on these lines,
without asking the permission
of Premier Bowser or anybody
else; and then we shall see —
another fly crushed in the party
machine.
“Country Ped”: What’s the
game—is the returned soldier
to be merely used as a pretext
for buying out the big squatter?
Anyway, the Vic. Board has
just bought £40,000 worth of
Purrumbete land at £l7 per
acre from a Western squatto-
crat. Yet three months ago a
Billjim, who was a practical
farmer, begged the Board to buy
for him a 60-acre irrigation
farm. A start there could be
made at once. The place is
well subdivided, with irrigation
channels and drains all through
it. There are 26 acres of
lucerne and a good six-roomed
house with all necessary out-
buildings ; in fact, everything
for a cow-farm bar cows and plant, and
only four miles from one of the largest
northern towns. The owner ‘ offered it at
£l6 an acre. But the Board wouldn’t
budge, and the soldier has gone on to
Bananaland.
It might be a good idea for Prime Minister
Hughes to hire a disinterested political friend
at £2 a week —just that he might have a
political friend.
An Australian who last year couldn’t net
4s. for his wheat has just got this letter
from his brother in Saskatchewan, Canada:
Crop good ; round here we are averaging 40
bushels to the acre and the fixed price works out
10s. 2Jkl. a bushel. So a farmer with 500 acres
under wheat gets over £lO,OOO for his little lot.
It won’t all be lifted this winter, but the mills are
going ding-dong night and day turning the grain into
(lour. Every farmer in the country now owns an
auto., and out on the trails on Sunday a horse
looks strange, for the farmer for once in his strenu-
ous life is. making big money and spending it.
The Australian, by the way, bought a sulky
on time-payment last year, and has just
written to the maker telling him to renew
the bill for another 12 months.
The Minister for Defence has repeated the
old prattle that wherever possible returned
men are being employed for preference in
his Department. Well, for a start, what
about the Staff Officer for Invalids and Re-
turned Soldiers in S. Australia? This posi-
tion is held by Capt. Campbell, who is also
starter for various racing clubs. There is
a good salary attached to the turf job; yet
many returned men, including officers, can-
not get one position, let alone two. More-
over, this is essentially a job for a returned
man; yet Campbell is not even an old
S’African soldier.
“The Ratcatcher’s Daughter”
The habit of saying “Arrest that man!” seems to
be catching. At a Voluntary Workers’ Assoc, meet-
ing in Sydney during the week George Fitzpatrick,
organising secretary, declared that the Federal
Government had blocked that little crowd of toilers
in a disheartening manner. “Mr. J. C. Watson had
even threatened to arrest Dr. Arthur and himself if
they went into the country to open branches.” Now,
how does ,T. C. Watson come to this goda’mightyship?
Incidentally, just to ascertain how much voluntary
work this son of the proletariat does, I move for a
return of the moneys paid from the Commonwealth
Treasury by way of salary, expenses, commissions,
etc., to J. C. Watson.

At present Uncle Sam is talking hopefully
about a couple of million enlistments. Aus-
tralia will, of course, have to maintain rein-
forcements for the men it has sent; but if
its Government had been better advised it
would have been content to make its army
less. Then, at any rate, Billjim wouldn’t
have been shaken up out of hospital to go
back to his trench job.
The “malcontents” of the Federal National
party are to be invited “to say whether they
are followers of the Hughes Government or
not.” That is all right in theory; but if
followers are elected on a teetotal basis and
the leaders are always going into the pub,
following becomes difficult.
“If I am in the way of union,” Hughes
told the warring parties in the House of
Reps., “I will stand down.” Whether he is
in the way of successful recruiting appar-
ently doesn’t matter.
The Phewsion must have learned its busi-
ness from Mark Twain. “In statesmanship,”
said Mark, “get the foi’malities right; never
mind about the moralities.”
HE COULD RUN THAT.
THE LADY ( rapturously): “Oh, those hats!
I could spend hours looking at them."
THE MAN: “Well, as long as you only
spend hours—go ahead.”
NOW OR HEREAFTER.

“The chief difficulty of the Germans, in the event
of their gaining a world-wide victory, would be with
those embers of freedom which would be constantly
liable to break forth in flame.” —English magazine.
Would ye rebel before or after?
Here is the choice that ye all may see!
Where were the harvest of love and laughter
If never a meadow or wood were free?
If these should triumph with flame and thunder
j And waste the homes that ye love so well,
Would ye be silent that black rule under -
And drudge as slaves in a man-made hell?
No, by the beard of a pirate father!
No, by the souls of the outlaw dead!
If their flag flew here ye would turn you rather
To slay and be slain than to eat their bread.
Then were ye rebels to law and order,
Hissing your scorn on their purple pride,
Raiding the farms on their scattered border,
Robbing the ships on their guarded tide.
Now, while the scales of the doom are falling,
Now may the weight of your blow, be known,
Now,- while the guns- guns are calling
And a tempest ,of death is on all winds blown.
Would ye be rebels before or after?
Here is the choice that ye all may make.
Strike; for the harvest of love and laughter
Truth.from the steel of their hope may take!

WORMS.
ONE NINE INCHES LONG AND ANOTHER FOUR
INCHES PASSED BY CHILD AFTER TAKING
COMSTOCK’S “DEAD SHOT” WORM PELLETS.
Mrs. A. E. Bade, of 203 McKillop Street,
East Geelong, Vic., writes : —“I have great
pleasure in writing to you to let you know
the satisfactory results I had in using your
‘Dead Shot’ Worm Pellets for my young son,
aged 14 years. He had been ailing for some
time and complained of pain in the spine and
a very sore stomach, and often in the night
would start vomiting without any warning
whatever. He also had several fainting
turns. I became alarmed and took him to
the doctor, but the treatment did him no
good. I then thought I would try your
Worm Tablets, as to me he had every
appearance of worms. I procured a bottle
of them, together with a bottle of Indian
Root Pills, and commenced the treatment.
The second day after taking them he passed
a stomach worm nine inches long, and the
next day one four inches long. Since then
he has picked up wonderfully and is twice
the child he was. If he shows any signs
again I will not hesitate to try them, as I
was so pleased with the results. I am most
grateful to the proprietors of these tablets,
as my husband is away on Active Service,
and the worry of our boy being so ill nearly
drove me mad. Thanking you again.”
STOMACH WORMS.
A MENACE TO CHILDREN.
Stomach worms are undoubtedly the most
invidious kind of all. They inhabit the
stomach and inflict great havoc upon their
victim. They deprive the victim of half the
nutriment he consumes, and when the
stomach is empty gnaw the sides of the
stomach, causing such terrible sensations as
to often cause faintness. Aperient medi-
cines have no effect upon them, for when
any purgative is taken they fasten them-
selves to the walls of the stomach by a
groove running down their side. The best
method of dislodging stomach worms is to
starve the system and take Comstock’s
“Dead Shot” Worm Pellets. The worms are
weakened by the want of food, and are
induced to take whatever is taken into the
stomach. Comstock’s “Dead Shot” Worm
Pellets contain the properties which sicken
and disable the worms, and a dose of opening
medicine will clear them out of the system.
Comstock’s “Dead Shot” Worm Pellets
are a purely vegetable medicinal preparation
for the eradication of worms in children and
adults. For sale by all chemists and store-
keepers, price 3s. 6d. per- packet, or will be
sent post paid at the same price by The
W. H. Comstock Co., Ltd., 23 Lang Street,

APOLOGY.
'V' HE action brought by Mr. R. D- Ba^ r - 'J h
1 im me is prominent in Sporting Uncles as
“Snowy” Baker, in respect of articles appearing last
rear in Truth, which dealt with the visit
America of the late boxing champion Les Darcy, has
been amicably settled.
AV'e have been afforded by Mr. W. IT. Drew, Mi.
Baker’s Solicitor, a perusal of all Mr. Baker s corres-
pondence and records dealing with the matteis
which were criticised in Truth and some of its
American contributors, and have made exhaustive
independent inquiries in the United States. We are
now convinced that the articles and criticisms ol
which Mr. Baker complains were based upon utterly
misleading information and wholly unmerited, and
that he acted throughout not merely in accordance
with the highest standards of ethics and honor, but
with signal generosity towards the late Champion
Boxer.
W'e, therefore, unreservedly withdraw, and apolo-
gise to Mr. Baker for, the publications complained
of, and agree to pay his legal expenses as between
Solicitor and client.

SPORTING
NOTIONS
The good thing comes off sometimes, and
there was no mistake about the A.J.C. Anniversary
Handicap. When Kctinaqualiair won the January, a
mile and a quarter, with Bst. 21b., and did it in
2min. sJsec., it seemed reasonable to expect that he
would be able to seriously argue the point over
another quarter-mile with 1111). less on top. But
weight and distance were not the only points ot
difference between the two events. In the longer
race the colt had to meet a better-class field than lie
beat on the shorter journey. Among them '' eie
Hitachi, who ran second to Poitrel in Tatt. s Cup,
Mehi King, Ulva’s Isle, the ancient Cisco and Chante-
merle,- though as the last of these arrived on. the
course with a leg that was not much use io him lit
didn’t matter very much. In all probability only
the tact of Dempsey having been brought across
from Melbourne to ride Kennaqualiair kept the colt
at the top of the betting, for there was solid course
backing for Hitachi, whose connections were nughty
confident. At the death—9 to 4 the favorite, 9 to
2 Hitachi, 10 to 1 Mehi King, the rest drifting away
from 12's to 100 to 2 for anyone who wanted a bit
on old Scoutmaster.
It was a race with only one in it. Hitachi, as
usual, slipped into the lead and stayed there 101 in
the journey, with Cliantemerle and Lady Liege, the
favorite making a leisurely trip in seventh place. At.
this stage Dempsey appeared to think the time was
ripe to start jogging along, and, drawing his whip,
persuaded the eolt .to hurry up. Within a furloii,,
he was up with the loaders, and Hitachi was done
with. Shaking off Ghantemcrle and Lady Liege
round the turn, lie landed clear into the stiaight,
and then Dempsey set out for the line. Biero was
nothing to seriously trouble him afterwards, though
had a waiting race been ridden serious trouble would
certainly have been provided by Wedding I)a\. She
came from a long way back, and with Ulva s Isle
was doing best at the finish. Mehi King got into
second place, but was beginning to falter towards
the end. Chantemerle was well up, but without a
punch. The winner stayed it out splendidly, and mil
be heard of again. But lie seems to want a lot ot
riding. * ■ *
With Bst. 71b. aboard, Bonnie Plume, get-
ting advantage of an early break on the field and a
mix-up behind her, ran out an easy winner of the
A.J.C. Challenge Stakes. For the Flying on the
second day she went up to 9st. 01b. and ' l,( ln t get
a break or anything else. The race went to Eulacre,
a useful Linacre mare in Booths stable, who thus
won twice in three starts. Hem, winner of the
Christmas Mile, who 1 had not been sighted _m the
Challenge, was next best, and the Rung Rosedell
was again beaten out of place. Rosedell is an
except ionallv fast animal, but seems cursed with a
great capacity for dropping the festive punter into
the soup. # »
Expectations of a set-to between the hurd-
ling champions Jack Rice and Greek Fire under in-
creased tonnage at Randwiek last week wei e like
unto those of peace. They didn’t come off Cieek
Fire being sore. But Jack Rice had a go with 13st.
41b., and, though not at his best, w-as making the
rest look as cheap as 2d. over the last bit ot the
two miles. Basil K, who has won three times out
of four starts, just staggered in with lOst. 101 b. a
neck ahead of the top weight.
* * *
One of the imported horses running at
Svdney has not won as often as he might if he took
ail interest in the proceedings a little earlier. This
is Rebus, a four-year-old by Radium. He isn t much
to look at, but at the business end of a mile can get
over the ground at a rare pace. The trouble with
him is that he begins as slowly as an elephant.
After winning at Rosehill in March Rebus was spelled
until last month, when he ran unplaced at Canter-
bury Park. At the A.J.C. Anniversary meeting lie
was given two runs, each over a mile, arriving third
and second respectively. Each time he was firmly
backed, persisted in viewing the proceedings from
away behind, and then, suddenly waking up, streaked
for the pole—arid showed everyone that he had com-
menced a fraction of a sec. too late. Perhaps
having been born in the Cold Country he wants to
be warmed up a bit to begin with.
* * * *
After n long sequence of seconds the
Charlemagne colt Woorawa got out of the Maiden
two-year-old class at Randwiek on Saturday by win-
ning the Phillip Stakes with 9st. 41b. from a smart
field in which he was giving away a heap of weight.
Earlier in the season Woorawa was being counted
on as likely to grow into a three-year-old above the
ordinary. He looks good enough still. But the next
thing to find out will be how much good all the
galloping he has had has done him. Having had a
win he ought to be entitled to arrest. *
Sport was so much curtailed in Sydney on
Saturday that there was only a meeting at Randwiek
with seven events and one over the road for ponies
at Kensington with 14 scampers on the programme.
As the seven events were over first there was natu-
rally a rush in the direction of the other seven.
Totalisators —at Randwiek, £19,000; at Kensington
£7OOO. The mania for “curtailing” everything but
Israel seems more rampant than ever.
* * * *
ilesert Cold dropped into Sydney at the
beginning of the week. The lady had a good trip
and was quite well, thank you. After resting a day
or two she goes to Melbourne to get ready for next
month. She was stripped for a walk-about at Rand-
wick on Tuesday, and what the little crowd saw was
a stronglv-quartered mare, of good height,
clean, firm-looking legs. There nothing te.mnme
about this nag. She is very dociie. Davis, Desert
Gold’s trainer, was at one time leading jockei fo
J. D. Ormond. Understood that N. McLaughlin wil
ride the mare in Australia. * * ■
Talking about Tatt.’s. Not man? cen-
turies ago a Sydney hotel manager and three friends
drew £lOOO and cut up the remittance. Ihe ticket
had been taken out in the name of Rowley Syn,
care of the aforesaid manager. Of course congratula-
tions were numerous. “I see you won a thou., the}
all commenced, and then the lucky one would ex-
plain “1 wish it was me, old man. Funniest thing
in the world! One night I was in the office when
some half-sozzled stranger pushed his bead -in. with
an apology for intruding. Oh, its all light I
<aid, Tin onlv writing for a few sweep tickets.
With that he produced some money, begged me to
g«R him one, signed his name on a piece of paper
and lurched off. That was three months ago arid
I haven’t seen him since and don’t know who be is
or where he is.” After the yarn had been told two
or three times the crop of hopeful triers began to
arrive—all strangers. They came briskly and con-
fidently. “Ah, boss, how are you ? Remember send
ing for a ticket for me when I was down in Sydnej
three months ago? I’m just wondering, what it
was ” “Yes, and you re on a thousand. 101
don’t say! Well, you’re halves.” Righto, thanks.
Just come in and sign your name for comparison
with the winner’s fist.” Some of them had a shot
at it and wrecked their hope this side of Eternity.
A daisy specimen of ‘ Rowley s penmanship

Dr * Arthur, who has heeu flicking Sydney
sports for failing to lift a hand at the returned
soldiers’ settlements, has at last got a bite. La.t
week 50 bookmakers challenged the medico to hr ng
along 50 M’s.L.A. to do a day’s work with them at
vr.,.i.,.,i (Sydney). The ink w'asn t drv on this
offer when another' lialf-hundred trainers and jockeys
proposed to put in eight hours with the politicians on
[became area. Dr. Arthur accepted both challenges.
It will he the strangest sideshow Sydney has seen
for many a day. But it will mean a roof over some
hard-u"p 'warrior’s head. And that is worth moie m
a storm than all the speeches that all the politicians
could make if they stayed away.

The owners of Lavendo. with a decent-
sized string of horses in training, have had little
luck at the game of late. They were, however, equal
to annexing the Geelong Cup, a handicap of 200
sovereigns, the other dav at the fust attempt. At
the subsequent drinking of the owners health Alan
Tve for himself and brother, confessed that then
connection with racing had certainly been a bit
cbstlv, but so far they had been able to stand the
pressure. That “so far” sounds ominous. A thou-
sand pities if the Tyes retire from the sport. They
arc of tlie clean type which does it honor.
* * * *
The guid Scotchbyterian proprietor o’ the
Geelong (Vie.) Advertiser has no time for racing
business, but does no’ mind if- the sinful punter
sends a brown bis way. There was a meeting at
Geelong last week, and Brother McTavish rose to
the occasion magnificently. He solemnly announced
that “we discourage gambling and do not publish
tins ” but in order to show how useful or useless
the art of prophecy might be a. few selections would
be made. The “selections” followed —and by the
sacred sporran, out of six shots he rang up four
bull's-eyes! They were 9 to 4, 6 to 1, o to 1 and
6 to 1 'chances! Looks as if it would be a dour day
for tlie s.p. merchants if McTavish staited liito the
game for keeps., It recalls the time when a Broken
Hill man, who .wrote a column of news-notes, said
at one Cup-time that he didn’t know the name of a
horse i’l the race and he reckoned Austialia would
be better off if it backed the grafter. Nobody
believed that he wasn’t a pious fraud, addicted to
companionship with stable-boys and pedigree experts,
when The Grafter won. # »
“Harrison O.” : I wish to warn Bulletin
readers, so that the blow will not fall too suddenly,
that they may miss my clever verses and para-
graphs in the future, as I am thinking of abandoning
the Inky Wav for the Primrose Path that awaits the
punter in the only Australian State to which the
totalisator has not penetrated. Ihe other day I
invested £2 in four bets at s.p. in connection with
the Aspendale meeting, backing Marehand both
ways for the first race, and Dhuldul, also win or
place, for the second. Marcliand won at 7 to £ oil
and Dhuldul came second at 3 to 1. As a result ot
Marchand’s victory I separated MacShortodds from
3s 6d., of which sum 9d. represented my dividend
from the place bet. By running into a place
Dhuldul enriched me to the extent of 7s. 6(1., and
by failing to win lost me 10s. So that the net
result of my four wagers—three of which I won —
was to tear from Ike.v Mo the sum of one shilling
sterling, which amount I propose to utilise as the
nucleus of a Fund for the Purchase of Champagne
for Impoverished Bookmakers.
“Cherokee”: “Let’s go round to Paddy
Reynolds’s,” said a returned Billjim of my acquaint-
ance ; and I could have sworn I saw a softening of
his face when I told him that Paddy had gone west.
He used to run the Cathedral Hotel. Melbourne, and
was a great pal of Jack Wren, lorn Bent and other
notabilities. “Bint?” he would say when anyone
disparaged that bluff bale of beef. “I’ve known Bint
sin’ be was a h’v, an’ him as phwhite as the dhrivel-
lin’ snow!” Paddv married one of his barmaids, and
at the wedding breakfast be rose to respond. “Oi
t ank you, gintlemen,” he warbled, in his quaint
falsetto. “It shows phwhat a young woman can do
f’r hersilf in Australia. Lasht week she was a
per gur-rl behind me ba-ar: an’ now she’s til’ wife
iv tlie prisident iv th’ Licensed Victuallers’ Associa-
tion!” (Thunders of applause.) He and Jack Wren
were interested in a horse of some celebrity, Solu-
tion with which thev intended to capture the Flying
Stakes at the 1906 Cup meeting. Paddy wanted
Jack to lav £7OOO to £2OOO on. “ ’Tis pickin’ up
the money 1” said he. Jack wasn’t having any, and
the horse, starting at 3 to 1 on, ran fourth in a
field of eight. Paddy saw black and blue. He lost
no time in finding Solution’s jock, and the question
he put to him has hardly been equalled, even at
Flemington. Outwardly calm, but with his grey
eyes flashing fire, he looked at the miserable rider,
and in a polite squeak, like the preliminary warning
of the break-up of an ice-floe, he asked, “And phwhat
detained ju ?” Besides following the turf, he was
a patron of boxing, and one noted pug, whom he
backed heavily, stayed at “the Cathedral” prior to
his match, it came off at the Richmond racecourse
and ended disastrously. At two the next morning
came a knock at the door of the pub. Paddy put
his grey head out of a first-floor window.
“Who’s dhere?” he asked. “It’s me, Mr. Reynolds
—Fitzbiff.” “An’ who’s Fitzbiff?” “Why, you
know me, Mr. Reynolds—Fitzbiff, the boxer. I’m
staying here.” “You did. You’re not now.’ And
down went the window.
“Jacko” : Someone in a recent Bulletin,
writing of John Skillicorn’s horseback trip from
Bathurst to Sydney in the early days, said that it
was done within 24 hours. The actual time was less
than 20 hours. Here are the facts. In September,
1860, Job Manning, a well-known Bathurst publican,
laid Skillicorn (who was a butcher) £l5O to £5O
that he couldn’t cover the distance on his horse,
Poor Man’s Friend, under 20 hours. Skillicorn set
out amid much excitement from Bathurst at 1 a.m.,
and wasn’t heard of till he had reached Hartley at
9.20. Odds were then freely laid against his success,
but Skillicorn bobbed up at Parramatta before 3 p.m.
and finally landed in Sydney at 8.50 pan., thus hav-
ing 10 minutes to spare. Despite the drizzle, crowds
gathered on the road at the points mentioned.
Skillicorn, who went nearly 12st., reckoned that he
exceeded the distance by 16 miles through taking
the wrong track and having to double back. The
horse stood the test well; Parkes’s paper, Empire,
said the animal looked as though it had come only
from Parramatta. In'the settlement Manning took
the point that Skillicorn had broken the terms by
not riding the whole distance, as he had walked the
prad a distance of 20 yards at Penrith for a drink
before mounting! He won on the protest, but his
pub was boycotted.
Bob Herring, who lias got into khaki,
holds the aggregate runs record (1987) in Melbourne
schools cricket. X. O. Dean (1706) and brother E.
F. Herring (1496) are next on the slate. Bob’s
biggest innings was 238—his contribution to the
schools’ record score (961) put up by Melbourne C.
of E. Grammar :V. Geelong College in 1915. In
that match J. C. Sharp notched the schools’ indivi-
dual innings record of 506. Behind the sticks
Herring is as quick as a cat. •

The Inter-State v. International two-day
cricket match, played on Sydney Cricket Ground
last week in aid of the War Chest, showed how
little interest is left in the game. The “gate”
panned out at £94 Bs. The Inter-Statesmen began
well by knocking up 413 (T. J. E. Andrews, 100;
A. Punch, 88 ; W. Berry, 82 ; A. Ratcliffe, 77 ; and
J. D. Scott, 82). The best the Internationals could
do was 276 (Noble, 106; S. E. Gregory, 58; R. B.
Minnett, 35 ; B. J. Folkard, 22 ; and Iredale, 19.
Burdsley was an early failure with 1). To use up
the balance of Saturday afternoon, the Inter-States-
mep went in again and added 114 runs to their
lead of 137 (E. L. Waddy, 4'l ; and E. A. Dwyer,
40 not out). Hordern with 6 for 117 did best
bowling for the Internationals; Mailey (4 for 77)
was arch-destroyer for the Inter-State team. The
least-dull minutes were the Xoble-Gregory and
Noble-Minnett partnerships. The dear old English
game (it is a better sedative than bowls) really
belongs to the leisurely age that closed with the first
cannon shot of 1914. ’ The pulse of the 1918 crowd
beats fast and the old-style torpid barracker who
would growl if any batsman took a sporting risk is
extinct. The Noble-Gregory interlude was a fine
exhibition of carpet driving and elegant cutting,
with the scoring brisk as a careful partnership
could make it. But the turn that roused the
crowd was Minnett’s livelier 35, made mostly by
ruluting out and lifting ’em. If the game is to
live on, someone will have to devise a way ot get-
ting the batsmen to do it often.
In the International-Interstate match in
Sydney wicket-keeper old Jim Kelly gave away only
two byes in a total of 413, and in the second innings
stumped Berry in great style. Kelly was wicket-
keeper in the .’96, *99, *O2 and 05 Austiftliiin XI. s.
In the triangular deaf-and-dumb matches
at Melbourne recently, Emerson, of Sydney, scored
110 against South Aus., and 42 and 124 not out
against Victoria —the tall average of 139 per mpings.
\gainst S Vus., Emerson also took nine wickets tor
HO runs. The triangular matches go the rounds
and will be in Adelaide next time.
Governor Galway, an old soldier who frets
at not being allowed an active part in this war, and
keeps himself fit by playing all kinds of games,
has toid a meeting of Adelaide sportsmen that it is
“absurdly stupid and wicked to sit down and grow
fat, simply because circumstances will not allow a
man to take an active part in the war.”

V. R. Bradbury, a Methodist chaplain who
has been handed the Military Cross, was at one
time a well-known oarsman in Vic. He stroked
Wesley College eight and afterwards the first win-
ning crew at Queen's College. lie also found a
place in the University crew. Bradbury had been
away from water for some time previous to going
to the war, and this led him into the bad habit
of breaking motor-cycle records along the roads in
the interior of the Speck.
• * * *
H A. Parsons, the Vic. motor crack, fled
up a’section of Wheeler’s Hill (Vic.) the other day
at 61 miles an hour. The stretch of road measures
1158 yards, or a trifle over six-tenths of a mile, and
has a grade varying from 1 in 5 to 1 in 7 over
every inch of the journey. The youngster scattered
J. Booth’s previous record for the same declivity on a
7-li.p. Indian bike shod with Barnet Glass Boomerang
tyres. # *
South Aus. Education Department has a
school-swimming scheme going at full pressure.
Besides following the lines of the Eastern States,
the Department proposes to erect concrete baths
in districts where there are neither swimming en-
closures nor handy creeks.
**• * *
The intended-to-be-annual swim from
Henley to the Grange, one mile 350 yards from
jettv to jetty along the Adelaide beaches, was spout
bv the over-handicapping which seems bound to be
a feature of any long swim nowadays. The first
batch were all men with from six to eight minutes
start and F. Bradley came home alone. The scratch
man,’ Spencer Major, from Wallaroo, took 28min.
24sec. to cover the distance, and as Bradley did it in
30rain. 38sec., and had a generous six minutes start,
the best man (and those near him) had not much
hope. You don’t find anybody in a fiye-mile race on
land given over a mile start, let alone real good
performers who would be only two minutes behind
the scratch man in a half-hour run.
Some of the amateur athletes of \ ictoria
are kicking against the controlling body because it
refuses to allow war eligibles to compete at meetings
or in events sanctioned by the Council unless they
show a passable excuse for not taking a sprint to
the trenches. Grumblings from the kickers have
been heard since St. Patrick's sports a year ago, unu
as St. Pat’s have another celebration due in March
the clash has commenced again. Sparks were begin-
ning to fly last week, and there was wild talk about
forming an amateur athletic union—a scheme ot
neither use nor ornament to the amateur, since it
would debar him from competing in Inter-State anil
Australasian championships, as well as the \ic.
championships. But it would seem a fair thing toi
the Vie. Association to come down the ladder a pit
and submit the question to the Australasian Jmon
(which is principally Dick Coombes, of Sydney), an
get at least a neutral award. The Associations 1
X.S.W. and Queensland, by the way, have not cealt
out a similar stringent regulation.
An a bo. named Note had a busy day up at
Charters Towers lately. In a three-standing-ju p
match with a paleface he did 30ft. 10in. without
effort winning by Tin. Then he was put against
horse. The animal, being a well-known show- ring
performer. Both did up to sft. 10m. T icn ‘
was raised to 6ft., and there it beat the pair, " e
abo was really not in form. When trained it >■
said tTbe 1000 to 1 on him doing 6ft. and covering
39ft. in the three-jump stunt. He is a lean,
chap about sft. Bin. from end to end.

smart. But in the absence of a decisive clout weig t

up dropped him some more. That was the
“Observer”: That par of D^ ei ( B
about a fox-terrier being afraid of a tox ( •
27/12/T7) makes me smile. The three ter .
referred to by “Quill Driver” must have been ot
many breeds and colors. I have often seen a drain-
pipe with a fox in it stopped at one end and a
terrier put in at the other, and every time the dog
brought the fox out by the throat. W hen a lad I
worked in the late Earl of Portsmouth s hunting-
stables in Devonshire and the terriers there would
run all day with the pack, and when the fox went to
ground would go to the earth and lug him out ihe
English badger is a far worse opponent than the
fox, yet I have seen a fox-terrier put a badger
lights out after a tussle lasting for over two houis.
The pure bred tyke doesn’t know what tear is.
“Burnsie”: The oldest inhabitant of More-
ton Bav (Q.) admits that he never saw so many
sharks before. There have been some terrible en-
counters with the brutes. One, after being plajed
for a long time, was dragged to the surface. It
was a lady and her husband was hanging on to hei
good and hard. Both were gaffed. Theie mjs
fft of her and 6ft. of him. A post-mortem on a
9ft. specimen produced eight youngsters each 18in.
A 12ft. specimen yielded a fully-formed bull-cal .
Was the meat tossed overboard from a passing ve.-
S or had the shark been ashore letting the slip-
rails down somewhere? # *

“L.S.” JUDHPORES, 22 16
TAILOR-MADE TO ORDER
TTHE Judhpore is a combination of the ideas responsible
JL for the production of Riding Breeches and Riding
Trousers of the usual design. With Judhpores you get
the fullness at the thighs and almost the same close fitting
at the knees as are features of Riding Breeches of regu-
lation pattern. No leggings are needed. The design
obviates the necessity of using laces or buttons at the
knee. The garments can be pulled on as quickly and
easily as ordinary Riding Trousers. You therefore get
also the commendable features of the latter.
There is no doubt as to the handiness of Judhpores, and
they have more than justified their great popularity in
Australia.
We quote our “L.S.” Special Judhpores in Military
Drills at 22/6, tailor-made to order. Other materials are
obtainable up to £4.

THE thing that the people should have
been allowed to realise from the outset
is that WE MAY GET A LICKING. We
still may get a licking. Are you going to
let the Ravisher of JJelyiur *» win without
lifting a hand?
A Warrak (Vic.) pub, The Live and Let
Live, has been delicensed. What s in a
name, after that?
Talk about rotten luck! W. Bahl. a \ ic-
torian loco.-driver, after spending 40 years
at his whizzing job without getting so much
as a scratch, was inveigled lately into a
motor spin. He had his doubts about it;
but he stuffed them away, settled himself
down comfortably—and then found liimselt
in bed nursing a few broken ribs and other
injuries which have since driven him to
resign.
Ormonde Birch, chaplain in the Indian
Army, who got the M.C. in Mesopotamia
lately after being twice mentioned in
despatches, is a Tasmanian, and took a hand
with a contingent from the Speck in the
S’African scrimmage 18, years ago. For
some time he was an Anglican parson, but
got a chaplaincy in India before the war.
He went to Mesopotamia with the first
Indian expeditionary force, and has been
there ever since.
Ivyabram, where the Reform fowl that
laid the still-born eggs came from, has been
making a better name for itself lately. Its
Methody parson has two sons, Capt. J. S.
and Captain J. 1). Rogers. Both have risen ,
from private, and both hold the Military
Cross. J.D. used to pull a good oar in Mel-
bourne Uni. boat, and was Ormond College's
fourth M.C. He has been in the trouble
since the Landing. J.S. was a science
teacher at Ivyneton High School, and has
not been off duty since he enlisted.
Eric T. Roberts, formerly of the,Austra-
lian Flying Corps in Palestine, was; changed
at Hawthorn (Vic.) with whizzing too fast
on a motor-cycle. He played his hand thus:
First card, he was not driving at 35 miles
an hour, as alleged ; second, his speed was
25 miles; third, he was a good judge of such
matters; fourth, as an aviator he' could
naturally control a motor-cycle better than
a groundling could do it; and fifth and
highest trump—he was the first Australian
aviator to fly over Jerusalem. The Bench
threw in its cards.
“O.”: The home-made motor-car built by
the late Geoff. Wall, author of “Songs of an
Airman,” was made out of four kerosene-
tins, six kerosene-cases and various odds and
ends of machinery. But the young Aus-
tralian made it go. His partner in the ven-
ture was a Wesley College chum, Harry
Rigby, now of the It.F.C. The pair actu-
ally motored from Malvern to Mount Martha
(about 35 miles), and felt that fame was
theirs when a pompous Hop bailed them up
for their license. , Last yeay they met in
France, and it was Harry Rigby who took
Geoff for his first flight.
Old John Morley, in the House of Com-
mons for 25 years, and Secretary of State in
turn for Ireland and for India, in his new
book of recollections gives away the whole
show of Party politics :
Much of Parliamentary debate is dispute between
men who in truth and at bottom agree, but invent
arguments to disguise agreement and contrive a
difference. It is artificial, but serves a purpose in
justifying two lobbies and a party idivision.... I am
sometimes amazed, and a trifle horrified, when I
contrast the loose, free-and-easy way in which poli-
ticians form their judgments, with the strict stan-
dards observed by every conscientious critic or his-
torian. So little evidence goes such a long way
when once your mind is made up.
Dookie (Vic.) Agricultural College is
hoeing its row very well. Over 300 students
have enlisted, and 46 have been killed. Be-
sides sending old boys to the Front, it takes
new ones when they return, and Lieut. L.
Searrott, who went from the trenches to the
furrows, speaks highly of the training.
Among, star pupils are (or were) Lance-
Corporal F. G. Hamilton, a Port Mel-
bourne boy who won the M.M. at
Bulleeourt and a Bar later on; and
Lance-Cofporal P. L. Nihill, who has
both-H>.CyAI• and M.M., and has been three
times iiVdespatches; Nihill was one of three
who rushed 30 iiuus and harvested them.
Then there is Capt W. J. T. Guilfoyle, M.C.,
of the R.F.C., son :of Botanic Gardens
Guilfoyle. He has brooded over Jerusalem,
outed "a Fokker in Egypt and rescued a
stranded airman whom he found in the
desert. Others are Capt. J. A. Lambden,
M.C;; one of four brothers on service, and
a plucky trench raider; M. F. Cockburn,
MM.; Trooper H. F. Pillow, M.M., of the
Light Horse; and L.-Cpl. R. C. G. Greig,
M.M., of the machine-gunners, killed in
action a few months ago. Greig’s brother
went west as a lieutenant in Gallipoli.
“Bauragi”: “John McL.’s” yarn (B.
3/(p318) about Papuan churches recallsjone
of winch I was senior-warden, architect,
master-builder, verger and general custodian.
That was on the Mambare, when Le Hurt to
was “Garbament big fella.” The Anglicans
had there two white missionaries, a hospital,
two white nurses and a string of South ,f)ea
sundries. Something special was called ;p>r.
and a stately tabernacle arose with walls of
split nipa and a real iron roof. There was
also a chancel with a raised floor and an
altar with reredos complete, made chiefly of
whisky-cases from Billy Hancock’s store.
There was also a belfrey outside with a
ship’s bell hung thereon. It was the only
chapel in a Government compound in Papua,
and the moral tone of the field rose notice-
ably. Soon afterwards the mission shifted
further south, and the house of prayer was
forgotten. Then one evening the old Bulldog
came up the river with the Bishop himself on
board. In spite of my attempts at dissuasion
lie insisted on inspecting the church at once, as
he had to start away early next morning. We
went down through the inky night, escorted
by two police boys carrying lanterns. As
we reached the door his Gaiters tripped over
the belfrey, which had fallen across the
porch. Uttering a benediction, he fell
through the front wall of the building, and
when I followed to the rescue I was felled
anu the pair of us were trodden into the mud
by a flight of evil-smelling fiends who pursued
the terrified police into the blackness with
dreadful noises. I explained to the Bishop
that an" unregenerate henchman must have
been using the sacred edifice as a shelter for
my herd of goats. He took the explanation
very badly, and the Mission put me in the
same class as my live stock. That was
umpteen years ago, and when I bowed to
the Bishop—now an ex-bishop—the other
day his acknowledgment was still frosty.

Announcement.
, The Goodyear Tyre and Rubber Co. of Australasia Limited are
pleased to intimate that arrangements have been concluded with that widely-
known Australian Company —Messrs. Elder Smith and Company Limited -
whereby the latter, on and after the ist February, 1918, will be the sole
distributors of Goodyear Mechanical Rubber Goods throughout Australia.
* "The whole of the large and varied stocks of Belting, Hose, Packing,
Valves and other Mechanical necessities held by Goodyear in Brisbane, Sydney,
Melbourne and Adelaide are being transferred to the stores of Messrs. Elder Smith
and Company Limited in those cities, from which immediate delivery can be given
of practically every mechanical rubber equipment necessary in Australian industry.
In addition to large shipments already on the way to Australia, further
extensive orders have been placed with the factory for all Mechanical
Goods, so that ample supplies will be arriving regularly to replace sales and
augment reserves.
The Mechanical Experts on the staff of Goodyear in Australia have
joined the sales force of Messrs. Elder Smith and Company Limited, and their
advice will, as heretofore, always be available on all matters connected with Mill,
Mine, Factory and Power Plouse equipment.
Before concluding this announcement we desire to assure present and
prospective users of Goodyear Mechanial Goods that the high quality standard
of these productions will be inevitably maintained —and probably enhanced by
ceaseless research and experiment.
Goodyear Mechanical Goods may cost more, but they are invariably
worth more.
The same selling prices which have been in operation for a considerable
period will continue until such time as it may be found imperative to make
alterations on account of market fluctuations.
' If through increased cost of raw materials it is ever necessary to raise
prices we will certainly do so rather than lower, by even the smallest fraction,
the Goodyear quality standard now 7 established and acknowledged throughout
the world.

Work on.
There was a time when the then mostly-
imported person didn’t reckon this country
could produce even its own lawyers. A Syd-
ney politician’s diary of October, 1840. con-
tains this entry:—
George Robert Nichols, the Colonial Attorney,
has been petitioning the Council to introduce a
clause into the Supreme Court Bill authorising the
Judges to make rules for the admission to the Bar
of Colonial youths; but the proposition has been
knocked on the head.
Matthew -uiry Stephen, the first “colonial
youth” admitted after the rash experiment
was made, is still living.
Thus the Government’s imported stipen-
diary weevil-killer, Professor Lefroy :—
It was even feared that a large portion of the
French army would have to be withdrawn to culti-
vate land for wheat. Every bushel of wheat that
Australia could grow would ultimately have a very
high value. .. . Just what the value would be at
the end of the war no one could say, but it would
be sound policy for Australia to accumulate the
greatest possible quantity of wheat.
Quite so —provided the Government can
borrow the gigantic sums required to enable
it to buy up and store the wheat, and pro-
vided the tear ends the right way. But if it
ends the wrong way the learned bug-smasher
should note that Germany will probably get
this country, and take the wheat and the
bugs for nothing. It may even soundly flog
the farmer for not keeping the wheat clean
till Fritz could come and steal it.
If Conscription is a political matter, then
they lie who tell the public that there is no
political censorship: for returned men are
not allowed to say in print whv thev voted
“No.”

on which you can correctly out all the rhythm

It is an instrument of extreme sensitiveness and so
utterly responsive that you express your musical
emotions almost without volition - instinctively
And at ary time it mey be converted tor hand -
pWind-when it is practically impossible to tell
it from a straight Piano.
We know you will appreciate the superiority of

STRENGTH —AND HOW TO GAIN IT.
INSTEAD OF EXERCISES, PATENT
FOODS AND MEDICINES, TAKE
PHOSPHATE WITH YOUR MEALS.
The demand to day is for men and women
who are strong in every sense of the word —
possessing the physical strength necessary
to endure hardships and fatigue; the mental
strength to grapple with difficult problems ;
the nervous force which endows the body
with vigor and vitality; the will-power to
triumph over adversity and turn defeat into
victory. But such glorious strength is
impossible so long as your nerves are weak
and exhausted, and therefore if you would be
really strong you must first care for your
nerves. Weak, exhausted nerves need food,
and it has been proved in numberless cases
that the only food element they can or will
absorb readily and naturally is phosphate in
the well-known form of bitro-phosphate.
which most chemists stock in 5gr. compressed
tablets, so that if you feel your strength is
failing from any cause, you > should get a
supply of these bitro-phosphate tablets and
take one with every meal. Practically all
of the minor ailments afflicting mankind, as
well as many of the more serious maladies,
can be traced to nervous exhaustion and
lowered vitality, and probably this explains
why such a remarkable improvement in tin-
general health is invariably noticeable when
bitro-phosphate is taken as directed, and the
nerves are thereby revitalised and made
strong.—Advt.

“C. Ockney”: The London Punch con-
tributor widely known as “F. Anstey” may,
as “F.N.T.” affirms (B. 24/l/’18), be a
cousin of Frank Anstey of the Reps. But
the “F. Anstey” of the books and plays
happens to be a pen-name. His other name
is Guthrie —F. Anstey Guthrie.
This appeared on the programme of a
patriotic concert at a N.S.W. Northern
Rivers town last week: “God savee the
King.” We piously hope so.
“B. J.” ; A decorative Australian who has
made a good start in the U.S.A. is Margaret
Linden. Here she was in the chorus of the
CHARLIE CHAP-
LIN, as he looks
when he isn’t earn-
ing his living.
Clarke and Mey-
nell comic opera
co. and scored an
ornamental success
as a postillion
attendant upon
Marquis Tom
Walls in “The
Belle of Brittany,”
incidentally pulling
off an ad. during
the Melbourne run
of the piece by
fainting one night
in the centre of the
stage. Upon arriv-
ing in the Wilson
republic Margaret
stepped almost at
once into a part in
“Anthony in Won-
derland,” on tour,
and was booked to
play the same
character in
N’Yark at the beginning of this year.
“8.J.” : George Treloar, who was playing
with Oscar Asche in London when he en-
listed with the Artists’ Rifles f subsequently
he was transferred to the Coldstream
Guards), has both the D.S.O. and the Mili-
tary Cross. George was a St. Pat.’s Col-
lege boy—he came from Ballarat and
acted with Julius Knight and later with
the Bailey-Grant co. He was playing the
younger Carey in “On Our Selection” when
he received an offer from Asche. Now he
is Captain Treloar.
This is a troublesome world for the Musi-
cal Soul. While he was rhapsodising
amongst the high C’s and drinking sonatas
with the gods, the time for furnishing com-
mon, earthy income-tax returns expired
like the Lost Chord. Then the Soul of
Albert Goossens, Belgian singer-, had to be
hauled down and fined £5 with 6s. costs m
Sydney Water Police Court. The outrage
happened last week.
“The Exile”: Londoners assume in their
patronising way that Australians are theat-
rically starved, and it was with much joy
that I was able to casually remark to very
prominent first-nighters in the Big Smoke
that “High Jinks”
—a current craze —
bubbled in Sydney
long before it
achieved its Lou-
don success. Few
Londoners know
that people like
Oscar Asche,
Madge Titheradge,
Rosina Buckman,
and the more re-
cent arrivals Fred
Leslie and Ivy
Shilling learnt
their trade “down
under.” About six
months ago, by the
way, I saw Sey-
mour Hicks trying
to be an American
in “Broadway
Jones”; but I had
had the delight of
hearing Niblo and
Hamilton in Aus-
tralia, and the com-
"The Lifeguardsman,”
at Melbourne
Princess’s.
The Plotting Prime
Minister
(H. W. Varna)
parison was not
nice. About one theatre-goer in 10 thousand
over here has ever heard of Niblo or Hamil-
ton.
“William Devine”: The Pointer who sup-
plied the original cast of “The Silver King
at Melbourne Theatre Royal was wrong in
one particular. He gave the iname or
Blanche Stammers as playing the part of
Olive Skinner, the Spider’s wife. \ oo j
Blanche (Mrs. Arthur Garner) was dead
and buried before the production. The part
was played by Jenny Watt Tanner, a re-
markably fine actress with a striking per-
sonality. Jenny was a well-known figure
on the Australian stage in the late ’7o’s and
’Bo’s, graduating from the ballet at the
Theatre Royal under Harwood, Stewart,
Hennings and Coppin. She became leading
lady to George Rignold in ’7B-9, her two
most notable successes being Chorus in
“Henry V.” and Lady Clancarty in Tom
Taylor’s “Clancarty,” while with William-
son, Garner and Musgrove she created the
part of Mrs. Beresford in the first perform-
ance of the delightful comedy, “Impulse.”
She was Mrs. Posket in the original Aus-
tralian production of “The Magistrate.”
Afterwards she was with Brough and Bouci-
cault, and was the Original wicked Countess
in “A Village Priest.” By this time she had
become somewhat mature, and was in great
request for “grand dame” parts. Later, she
dropped out of sight, and was understood to
have gone to London to push the fortunes of
a daughter who had displayed some signs of
talent. Two or three years ago she was
playing Mrs. Braey’s old part in a London
production of “The Geisha.”
“Arjacee”: Re “Nosey’s” wail (B.
17/1/T8) about the poor manager and the
sordid musician. To make ends meet quite
a lot of first-class artists have to endure a
day’s ill-paid teaching drudgery, and finish
up at the theatre in the vicinity of midnight.
Some of them have family responsibilities.
(My own niob are responsible for 20-odd.)
Four of my lot in pre-war times invested
in homes. Four years.ago the Musicians’
award said £3 per week. It is still saying
so. Any man who undertook responsibilities
before the war and hasn’t had his pay in-
creased is doing some hard thinking nowa-
days. Breakages often reduce the earnings.
A case within my knowledge cost the unfor-
tunate in one week 50s.' for new drum heads.
This man was an artist on his instrument,
too. (Yes, there are artistic drummers.)
String instruments suffer worse. This is
especially the case at waterside picture-
houses, where recently one basso had, after
paying fares, etc., a whole ss. to hand his
missus for his week’s work. The weird
noises complained of by “Nosey” are more
often than not introduced at the request of
alleged managers. Only a few weeks since
one of these asses bobbed his head over the
rail and suggested, “Play some Manly boat
stuff; there’s some people from there in the
house to-night, and they’d like it.”
“Jwosp”: Don’t call Guy Bates Post a
“new” American actor. He’s a renewal,
rather. Starting with Brown Potter and
Bellew in 1895, he got to New York in 1901.
After being first support for a few years
he reached the leading role in “The Heir of
the Hoorah” in 1905, was principal man to
Mrs. Fiske in 1907-8, and in 1909 became a
star in “The Bridge” and scored heavily
with the public straight away. For a few
years he fell off; but he seems to be
scintillating brightly again in “The Mas-
querader.”
One of Guy Bates Post's biggest Yankee
successes was scored in a dramatic version
of Omar Khayyam ; but there is no hint of
Australia seeing this.
The burning of the Town Hall at
Wallaroo (S.A.) has brought up again the
question of the picture-show run by that go-
ahead mining town. Private Enterprise in
the picture business has made all sorts of
handsome offers to the Municipal Corpora-
tion ; but the answer is just that other
arrangements have been made. The last
meeting of the Council had to consider a
letter from an Adelaide lawyer, giving the
opinion that running pictures is no part of
a Corporation’s functions, and threatening
proceedings on behalf of a rival showman.
But the letter was only “formally received.”
“Peter”: The amount of daring credited
to little Fayette Perry, who is one of the
minor features of “Aladdin” in Meloourne,
would make the late air-crack, Guynemer,
seem like an organiser for the Curates’
Union. According to communiques issued
from the King’s Theatre, Fayette has already
defied Death in balloons and aeroplanes and
once dived into a fire-brigade net from a sky-
scraper window. Also, she was once sus-
pended on a wire as a fairy in a panto,
when, suddenly losing her means of support,
she got a reserved seat in a stout man’s lap.
Fayette’s proximity to fat men at critical
moments is rather remarkable, by the way.
Iler modest biographer mentions that she
recently grabbed a capitalist by the scruff of
the ear and lifted him out of the way of a
tram. Tiny Fayette, who can make the
scale shudder up to 7st. aud a bit over, is
evidently a reckless character who is con-
tinuall- encountering dangers that are not
her size. One of these days we shall get the
truth about her, and it will be something
anent her falling into the inkwell through
sliding down the pen.
Bryceson Treharne, piano-teacher at the
Adelaide Couservatorium and founder of the
Adelaide Literary Theatre, has emerged as
a song composer of the first rank. It was
all due to the Hun. Treharne was at Berlin
when the war came, and for 18 months
resided at Ituhleben Prison Camp. There he
composed 200 songs, several orchestral pieces
and the score of a Japanese opera. War

spired him. (The
straw was added
for bulk, and the
sand was necessary
for weight—where-
by the Hun ingeni-
ously complied with

Treharne remarks:
“One becomes very
active mentally on
a limited diet. It
really seems to act
as a spur; one’s
head becomes clear,
and the amount of
mental labor which
can be performed
under, such condi-

harne out, and he
was exchanged and

He liked her figure neat,
And so he spread himself to kill,

Simple and Effective Methods.
By Olga Amsdell, Special Correspondent,
London, Eng.
Why Have Grey Hair?
Few people know that grey hair is not a
necessary feature of age—that it can be
avoided without resorting to hair dyes. A
very old, home-made remedy will turn the
hair back to a natural color in a few days.
It is only necessary to get from the chemist
two ounces of concentrate of tammalite and
mix it with three ounces of bay rum. Apply
this simple lotion to the hair for a few nights
with a small sponge and you will soon have
the pleasure of seeing the greyness disappear.
This recipe is perfectly harmless, is neither
sticky nor greasy and has given perfect satis-
faction for many generations to those in
possession of the secret.
Blackheads, Oily Pores, etc.
• The new sparkling face-bath treatment rids
the skin of blackheads, oiliness and enlarged
pores almost instantly. It is perfectly harm-
less, pleasant and immediately effective. All
you have to do is to drop a stymol tablet,
obtained from the chemist, in a glass of hot
water, and after the resulting effervescence
has subsided dab the affected portions of the
face freely with the liquid. When you dry
the face you will find that the blackheads
come right off on the towel, the large pores
contract and efface themselves and the greasi-
ness is all gone, leaving the skin smooth, soft
and cool. This treatment should be repeated
a few times at intervals of several days in
order to make sure that the result shall be
permanent.
The Magnetism of Beautiful Hair.
Beautiful hair adds immensely to the per-
sonal magnetism of both men and women.
Actresses and smart women are ever on the
look out for any harmless thing that will in-
ci’ease the natural beauty of their hair. The
latest method is to use pure stallax as a sham-
poo on account of the peculiar glossy, fluffy
and wavy effect which it leaves. As stallax
has never been used much for this purpose it
comes to the chemist only in Jib. sealed origi-
nal packages, enough for 25 or 30 shampoos.
A teaspoonful of the fragrant stallax gran-
ules, dissolved in a cup of hot water, is more
than sufficient for each shampoo. It is very
beneficial and stimulating to the hair apart
from its beautifying effect.
How to Remove a Bad Complexion.
Cosmetics can never really help a poor com-
plexion; often they are positively harmful.
The sensible, rational way is to actually re-
move the thin veil of stifling, half-dead scarf-
skin from the face, and give the fresh, vigor-
ous and beautiful young skin underneath a
chance to show itself and to breathe.
This is best done in a very simple way, by
merely applying inercolised wax at night, like
cold cream, and washing it off in the morning.
Good mercolized wax can be obtained from
any well-stocked chemist. It absorbs the dis-
figuring cuticle gradually and harmlessly,
leaving a brilliant natural complexion. Of
course, this also takes with it all such facial
blemises as red blotches, tan, moth patches,
sallowness, liver spots, pimples, etc. As a
freckle remover and general complexion beau-
tifler this old-fashioned remedy is unequalled.
The Powder Puff Passes.
Every normal woman is always interested
in any plan by which she can quickly enhance
her beauty, provided the plan is perfectly safe
and simple. Ever since the discovery that
ordinary cleminite, such as any chemist can
supply, is an instantaneous and harmless
beautifler, there has been a growing demand
for it from smart women everywhere. They
usually get about an ounce and add just
enough water to dissolve it. A little of this
perfectly harmless lotion gives a beautiful
complexion to any face instantly. It renders
face powder quite unnecessary. Moreover, its
use cannot be detected. The skin is instantly
beautified but appears perfectly natural
under the closest scrutiny. [3

THE LARGEST STOCK
in Australia we carry of Spoon and Fork Cabinets,
Canteens and Cases.
Our output of them is so large it pays us to stock
So large a turnover? Presumably because a very
discriminating public realises that we lead in
quality, in price, in style with them.
We really do lead with them.
Because we put our best brain efforts back of them.
Because our Spoons and Forks are made by the
latest machinery, which saves enormously and

The “PLUM”
Razor.
It isn’t only the lads who have a fancy
for the Flying Corps. A recently-accepted
candidate was John Henry McLochlan, and
he served in the S’African war under Gen-
eral Munro, the man who planned and con-
ducted the mysterious Evacuation from
Gallipoli.
“Murray” : There’s a pretty fair collection
of old “tokens” in the Albury Museum, of
all places in the world. There are penny
and half-penny bits issued by business houses
in Melbourne, Sydney, Ballarat, Goulburn,
Hobart and elsewhere and in divers towns
in Maoriland. The habit of issuing tokens
was kept up late in M.L.; there’s one issued
as recently as 1874 by an Auckland pub.
“Araminta”: Another thing Australia is
able to make better and cheaper than the
imported blessing; and that’s sand-soap.
Most of the overseas soap seems „o be made
on the principle that the sooner each block
is used up the better for trade. The Aus-
tralian-built product is hard and lasts twice
as long as the crumbly imported stuff, while
having all its advantages. Yet there is hardly
a grocer who will supply the local goods
unless they are specially asked for.
The 12th Battalion has been keeping the
Speck’s end up. At a dinner in France on
October 20 to celebrate the third anniver-
sary of the day on which the battalion sailed
from Hobart the following list of honors
won by members was reeled off: Two V.C.’s
(Captain J. E. Newland and Sergeant J. W.
Whittle); one C. 8.; one C.M.G.; four
D.S.O.’s (one of which belongs to the com-
manding officer, Lieut.-Col. C. H. Elliot, the
first Australian to get that award in this
rumpus—he has a bar to it now) ; 13 Mili-
tary Crosses; 14 D.C.M.’s; 98 Military
Medals; one Croix de Guerre; one Cross of
Karageorge (Serbian) and a Serbian silver
medal.
J. M. Lamborne, just appointed boss of
Sydney fire-brigades, started life as a com-
positor in Northern Vic.; he passed out of
the Barrier Miner office 20 years ago to
take charge of the Broken Hill brigades,
and has had that job ever since. A fine
organiser, with the knack of handling men,
he would probably have been out of Broken
Hill long ago if he had known less about the
special business of dealing with mine fires —a
more ticklish job than handling an outbreak
in a 10-storey building because of the deadly
gases that smouldering timber generates
underground. There was one fire in the
Broken Hill Prop, that beat off every ad-
vance upon it and lasted for ' close-on 20
years.
George Meudell’s yarn :
The utterly uncalled-for misuse of the Honorable
Randolph Bedford's name by the Warwick (Q.) bell-
man recalls an incident of one of my many attempts
to serve my country for three hundred a year and a
golden railway pass. At Queenscliff (Vic.) I tackled
the late Jonas Felix Levien, who had been re-elected
without a contest for 28 years. The local campanolo-
gist was a fisherman by profession, and carried on
campanology as a sideline. For half a crown an
hour this is how he announced my first election
meeting in the Town Hall: “To-night, to-night, at
hate o’clock, the right honnerible Mr. Bluebell will
address the helectors, and to-morrow mornin’ at nine
I’ll be round with fresh barrowcooter.” I’ve since
heard Swiss goatherds yodelling to their flocks, but
the Queenscliff bellringer excelled them with his
long-drawn-out “cooter.”
“Bad Australian” ; Passing the toniest fur-
rier’s shop in Buenos Aires 1 saw a muff and
collarette which reminded me of old bare-
footed days when I shooed cockatoos and
crows off the wheat and chased the nimble
Opossum out of the corn patch. I went in
and asked the price of the set, which was
made of seven silver-greys—not the big,
black-pointed silver-grey of the blue-gum and
messmate forests; just the ordinary little
cuss of the white box and apple-tree country.
The effusively-polite son of Old Castile behind
the counter informed me that he was sacri-
ficing that line of chinchilla at $l2O (about
10 guineas) ; and when I pointed out that I
had pursued the chinchilla in his native
haunts in Bolivia and Upper Peru, and that
these furs didn’t seem to belong to those
wily beasts, he explained that these were not
that kind of chinchilla, but Chinchillas Aus-
tralianos, which, although not quite so fine
as the Chinchilla Sud Americano, was about
20,000 per cent, more durable; that, as a
matter of fact, you simply couldn’t wear the
nap off the tough-fibred Australiano. Then
I thought of the thousands of Chinchillas
Australianos I had recklessly wasted in
those old days, and it occurred to me that if
I had only put those pelts in cold storage or
safe deposit, instead of trading them off to
Sam Lee, the Pong hawker, for 2s. 6d. per
dozen, I would now be known and respected
as the Chinchilla King.
“Jacko”: The present training of such
special units as the A.S.C. in the Citizen
Forces is a painful :nd expensive farce.
During the past few months the members of
the absurdly-inadequate eight companies
that are sprinkled over N. S. Wales have
been dragged into Liverpool camp for eight
days at a time. But in actual fact the
training period has been reduced to about
five days—three are spent in getting fixed up,
a Sunday is lost, and the breaking-up day is
negligible. Even the ridiculously brief time
is not employed in real training. The
trainees, who should be instructed in the
technique of the game (and Heaven knows
there’s enough of it to learn!) are given the
highly-specialised job of carting wood to the
circular-saw that the Department has in-
stalled at Liverpool, after discovering that
thousands of pounds had been paid away
unnecessarily for sawn fuel. As a relief
from this monotony, these specialist trainees
are put on to cleaning stables. The nearest
they ever get to A.S.C. work is carting sup-
plies from the station to the camp and thence
to “Germany,” otherwise the Holdsworthy
Concentration Camp. The wretched sham
costs about £5 per head. We still have uni-
versal service for home defence. A blind
man can, however, see that an attack upon
it is coming; and if it is turned down, to
the awful peril of Australia, it will be
because thousands of busy men, like myself,
are convinced the present scheme gives hardly
any value in training for a great deal of
money.

Permanence
When an institution, almost from its in-
ception, takes the commanding position in its
field—
And when that institution maintains the
commanding position without interruption
over a series of years —•
Then you may be assured of that institu-
tion’s integrity—both as to its product and
its dealings with the public.
From an annual output of 465 motor cars
nine years ago The Willys-Overland Com-
pany has grown steadily, and this year its
dealers have contracted for more than 200,000
motor Cars.
Its net resources have grown m that time
from a little more than £lO,OOO to more than
£13,600,000.
This year the Willys-Overland factories
are building the most comprehensive range
of models ever'produced by any. one motor
car concern.
If yours is a family of average size, you
will be particularly interested in either the
Big Four-cylinder Overland touring car, fin-
ished in a rich brown, or the Light Four
touring car, finished in gray. These two
models exemplify the remarkable values char-
acteristic of the entire group.
When you buy any motor car in the Willys-
Overland group you are assured by our com-
manding position in the industry—by our
unequaled facilities and resources—of integ-
rity of values in your motor car throughout
the whole period of its performance in your
service.

The Inky Way.
“Copy Boy”: A writer who left a news-
paper in which he had for some years run a
column under a pen-name, recently obtained
an injunction in the Philadelphia Court of
Common Pleas to restrain the rag from con-
tinuing to publish stuff under the nom-de-
plume. Seems to me it might be well worth
the while of an inky-wayfarer who has won
a reputation pseudonymously to register his
brand under the Trade Marks Act. In Aus-
tralian journalism it is customary for news-
papers to appropriate pen-names which have
acquired a reputation; writers come and go,
but the same old pen-name goes on for ever.
A weekly topical column still appears in
Melbourne over a nom-de-plume that was
used by Marcus Clarke and his half-dozen
successors. “Oriel” in Ihe Saturday Argus
has covered a score of identities, and for a
good many years the column has loafed on
the reputation given to it by Johnny Sandes.
Died at Sydney, Mrs. Josephine Bennet,
relict of B. J. Bennet, aforetime proprietor
of the Burrangong (N.S.W.) Argus. She
was born in Dublin in 1840, and came to
Australia in 1562. That Henry Flood who
was so prominent a member of "the old Irish
Parliament before the Union (1801) was her
grandfather; and her father was Chief Clerk
of the Court of Chancery in Dublin.
The ARGUS was in a frivolous mood on
the 14th inst. when she printed, over an item
about the meat-shortage in England, “The
Meat Pinch” ; and, underneath that, “Mayor
Seizes Mutton.”
* * * *
Eighty this month, Robert Chaffer, of
Adelaide, who came from London to Mel-
bourne in 1852 and put in nearly 30 years
as Argus printer. The family meant to go
to Sydney, but all the sailors deserted in
Melbourne to pick up nuggets, and the ship
Deborah became a prison-hulk. Since 1882
Chaffer has been a S. Australian ; he built
up the Modern Printing Co., now run by his
son.
* * * *
Fred Cutlack, who has been appointed
assistant war-correspondent under Bean, is
only 3L He was a Renmark boy with a
literary father, and took various honors,
chiefly literary, during his education in Adel-
aide.' Then he went on to the Register, as
secretary to editor Sowden, but presently
took a fancy to try his luck in London. The
luck was various, and he spent much of his
time in reading for the Bar. He enlisted
early, and has been wounded twice. Some
of his articles have been widely published
already, for he was allowed to come out on
the Australia on her first voyage and write
an account of it.
* * * *
“75”: Some time ago, in connection with
the Hughes-Watson libel action, it was
announced in the Melbourne press that the
matter had been settled and that Hughes
had paid the costs of both sides. A para-
graph in London Sunday Siironicle, to
which Hughes recently contributed some
windy articles, reads: “Mr. Watson has
withdrawn the charges, and will pay the
costs of both sides.” Anybody know who is
the Chronicle’s xYustralian correspondent?
Perth Press Club was hesitatingly allowed
to go into voluntary liquidation the other
day. The sworn declaration of the officials
that it was unable to pay its debts passed
muster all right; but what puzzled Justice
Burnside was how a club with a wine, beer
and spirit license came to be incorporated
under an Act which was only intended for
chapels, churches, pious bodies and associa-
tions which do not have a bar or sell booze
and never want to go . into liquidation.
Then counsel stated that some of those who
originally formed the club had religious
leanings and quoted Scripture between
drinks, and his Honor granted the applica-
tion.
* * * *
About a friend of the family:—
He nodded pleasantly as he came abreast, and 1
invited him to beer and a sandwich. He waxed
poetical on the view, and reeled off yards of Words-
worth. I was interested. Had he seen better
days? He sighed and admitted it. The drink was
his trouble. He had disgraced his family and was
sent out to Melbourne, where he took a job
as dramatic and literary critic for the Argus to
augment his “miserable pittance.” (He hotly denied
having ever written any of its leaders.) The" respect-
able journal could not stand his constant backslidings
and passed him out. He referred to his own “little
things” for The Bulletin, and produced clip-
pings of some of the most delightful verse of Mabel
Forrest. I looked the query, and he modestly ad-
mitted to being “M, Forrest, of The Bulletin.”
Then I brained him with the empty beer bottle and
shoved his carcase in a hollow log.
THE LITTLE WOODEN BELL.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
When the weary day is over and the high white
stars look down
On the maze of lights and shadows that compose the
sleeping town,
When the pen can go no further and the hot eyes
seem to swell,
Comes the sweet and cheerful chiming of the Little
Wooden Bell.
“Time to douse the light and chuck it!” sings the
Little Wooden Bell.
There are vesper bells for Christians, there are
temple bells for lnd,
Sending out their soothing message on the soft and
scented wind ;
But for me there is a summons of a less pretentious
type—•
Just the hurried clink-clonk-clitter of my neighbor’s
final pipe,
And it tells its message clearly does that little
tapping pipe.
“Praise your God for good tobacco that will see you
through the day,
Till it’s time to spill the ashes and put your pipe
away.
It is sleep and good tobacco that makes Heaven out
of Hell—
Good-night, all; see you to-morrow,” says the Little
Wooden Bell,
Says the singing and the ringing of the Little
Wooden Bell.

Just as Mr. Edison’s first phonograph astounded the music-world,
so has his newest invention —The NEW EDISON —astonished
music-lovers.
This is altogether different from, and superior to, ordinary talking-
machines; it is in a higher class—-a class all by itself. There is
no other instrument in the world that will Re-create music but
The NEW EDISON
Miss Julia Heinrich, prima donna of the Metropolitan Opera Company, and
also an Edison artist, recently stated : “When I first heard the Edison Re-
creation of my voice, tears came into my eyes, I was so thrilled. It seemed
uncanny. I knew I was listening for the first time in my life to the real
Julia Heinrich.... I have noticed the fidelity of the orchestral Re-creations
supporting a Re-created voice.... Mr. Edison has certainly done something
that nobody else seems able to do.”
You ought to get The NEW EDISON for YOUR home.
The latest model A-85, illustrated, is a grand instrument, and is wonderful

Sapper Haineswood, H.R.F.,
left for “Somewhere in France”
during February, 1917, with
the 25th Reinforcements of the
Ist Divisional Signal Co. He
had already seen service in
Egypt and Gallipoli, and wrote
to us before leaving : —•
“Just a word of praise for
a truly good remedy, Laxo-
Tonic Pills. I think they are
splendid. In this climate
everyone needs a pill now
and again, and Laxo-Tonic
Pills are so easy to take, and
leave you feeling so well
afterwards. They gave me
an appetite and made me
relish my food. I used to
suffer from headache and
pimples occasionally, but
now, if I feel that either is
coming on, I know that
Laxo-Tonic Pills will fix me
right at once and prevent
any such trouble.”
Yours sincerely,
SAPPER HAINESWOOD, H.R.F.

BOOTS are the smart wear for the season
—Dame Fashion has cast that die most
decisively—and this white poplin boot,
fashionable, short-fronted, with a trim,
military heel, will look uncommonly well with
the short white skirts of this season. Then,
better still, like all the short-fronted models
in the Bostock range, it is quite amazingly
comfortable, and will suit all types of feet. In
fact, most women will get a pleasant surprise
when they try it on, and see how nice it looks
and how delightful it feels. And it will con-
tinue to feel delightful in wear, since all
Bostock soles are specially treated so as to
extract from them those chemicals used in
tanning, which are apt to make the feet hot
and tired. So, in this boot one will be
dainty, cool and fresh, able to enjoy walks,
picnics and excursions in the most blazing
weather.

IMPORTANT.—LOOK TO YOUR TEETH.
There are no teeth like those furnished by Nature. For service, comfort and good
health, artificial teeth cannot be compared with a natural set.
Sensible people will accordingly try to preserve their teeth as long as possible by
keeping them clean. Cold water and soap and water are useful, but somewhat
ineffectual. Rough powders, such as cuttlefish, crabseyes, crude chalks and chaicoal
are too severe on the enamel.

When the Eels Gome Down
the River.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
DREAM pools and whimpering willows,
and sweet beside the bridge
The prattling of the rapids over
many a shallow ridge,
Bright Avators gaily swinging down betAveen
the quiet shores,
All golden-voiced like radiant girls in muslin
pinafores;
Like little laughing girls who romp adoAvn
some oaken hall,
The rapids gleam like muslined girls, the
river voices call.
The AvilloAV Avands are musical; the reeds
sing weird and low ;
The breeze takes up the harp of Earth ; the
river draws her bow,
And from the platform of the hill, the stage
of slope and glen,
There rings the wonder-message for the ears
of simple men ;
For simple men who hear the hymn of
Beauty chanted loud
By flowers and pearl-grey butterflies and
tinted wisps of cloud.
And now the warm earth slowly tilts its
fretted edge and spills
A deep day-draught of mellow sun behind the
lifting hills,
And, tilting, dips Avith thirsty rim within the
fount of Night,
Brimming Avith stars and mystery before the
charmM sight;
AVhile lisping ’round the pebble-place the
silvern ripples run,
And the eels come down the river at the
setting of the sun.
The eels come from the reeded beds and
every shadowed place ;
Like fleeting thoughts of sombre things,
they cross the Avater’s face.
The eels come from the willow-shades when
all the Avorld is still,
And here you’ll see a coil of green, and there
a yellow gill,
And here you’ll find a gleaming eye, and
there a shining fin ;
For the eels come doAvn the river when the
night is drawing in.
Grim regiments of forest-trees are standing
rank on rank;
The beeches gleam like nickel rods upon the
further bank.
But every tune the river plays now holds a
sorrow-note;
A tui wakes a wistful song which dies within
her throat;
For joy walks with the twilight out to Avhere
the sun has gone ;
For the eels lead down the rh T er and the
darkness follows on.
And the river, oh the river-tide is harsh
upon its bars!
The gaunt eels leave the haunted shades to
hunt beneath the stars ;
Dark shadows deep within the deep, they’re
passing, passing by,
Like echoes from the moaning trees or flecks
of wintry sky;
And the Night is stealing, stealing o’er the
weary heart o’ me,
While coil and coil the river Avrithes in
darkness towards the sea.

“Predestination, Faith and
Works.”
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
CAPTAIN ARCHIBALD McALISTER,
master and owner of the schooner
Bird of Paradise, set sail from the
Trobriands for Samarai. He had traded
long in the Solomons, and his crew were
mostly bad men of Malaita—doubly bad
because they had been the last returned
Kanakas from Queensland under the White
Australia Act, and had a grievance
against white men; trebly bad because they
had been half-Christianised. That which the
missionary begins with adult Kanakas the
Devil finishes.
These deportees had returned from Queens-
land to Malaita with much “trade,” and the
trade ivas not hymn-books. Rather was it
extraordinary loud lingerie for dark ladies
previously clothed in a suit of cocoanut-oil,
and these ladies kicked through the filmies.
the madapolam, the Swiss embroidery and
the torchon in two hours by a fast clock.
The trade, furthermore, included accordions,
mouth-organs, walking-sticks, spectacles for
eyes that could look at the sun by noonday;
white suits that became as cheese-cloth with
the first rain; tobacco, and tobacco, and
again tobacco; canned goods and things of
which the Australian Government made ex-
port penal—shotguns, rifles, revolvers,
ammunition and dynamite. Yet, there are
always mean whites to supply the black,
brown or any other sort of enemy with
weapons for the killing of white men or any
other sort of man ; for as a nail sticketh on
the joints of the floor, so doth roguery stick
between buying and selling.
They had fired off all their ammunition
on Malaita, had pawned the last gun for a
little food and advertisement, had exploded
their dynamite to the damage of many fish
and one village. And at long last they had
been signed on before the Government Resi-
dent by McAlister, and driven to sea as
white men and better men than they have
been by the whips of poverty on the land.
Off watch they gambled all day and sang
hymns at night, dolorous howls of Moody
and Sankey replacing the harmony of the
songs of their villages; sailing on and under
and through beauty they could not see; San
Cristoval and Guadalcanal-; up the splendid
channel to Nedrai, where grass-tree, jungle,
lawyer-vine, palm and creeper grow from sea
edge to the blue black mass of forest on the
foothills. They threaded little straits between
patches of palm-covered sand, with surf
breaking lazily in long sluggish curves;
black-green islands came to them and went
astern; black canoes, graceful as the gon-
dolas of Venice, floated up to golden beaches
as if they had volition and intelligence; and
the long-tailed bosun-bird flew over all.
Past all these islands went the Bird of Para-
dise —a sulky ship. Convolvuli, croton and
celandine charmed them not, nor the sight of
electric-blue fish on pink and grey coral. The
loveliness and the divine air called for drift-
ing ; the pigeons in the island woods cooed
drowsiness; yet the Bird of Paradise sailed
through it all, Gavutu to Gizo and the Short-
lands and on to the Trobriands.
Such of the crew as were returned boys,
and they were many, seduced the unsophisti-
cated ; lectured them against giving a fail-
deal to the master; told them stories of the
wages they had known in Queensland plan-
tations before deportation—thirty shillings
a week and food and lodging; sneered at the
standard island rate of ten shillings a month
as a half-loaf, worse than no bread. They
found the native labor content and taught
them, in the manner of the travelled, the
damnable doctrine of “Ca’ canny”; for to
Australia and the Coral Sea agitators are
not indigenous, and have to be imported.
Glibly they told the untravelled native of
the missionary’s promise: “Missionary boy
be go longa top side; white man he go down
alonga fire altogether too much.”
Atta, the ringleader and bush-lawyer of
them all, a big, ugly, black .and brown man,
slippery with cocoanut-oil, his skin smelling
as if his daily diet were shark long deceased,
and made more brutal of appearance by
reason of the triangular piece cut out of his
upper lip. was almost openly mutinous. Once,
receiving an order from McAlister with open
contempt, McAlister, for the sake of disci-
pline and the safety of the ship, at the
moment practically in irons, knocked Atta
down and booted him up again. Atta was
afraid to show open resentment; he merely
went to his duty muttering: “White man he
no savvy alonga Malaita man; Malaita man
he savvv everything too much.”
McAlister did not care to follow up the
insolence, being a man who knew well how
to let sleeping dogs lie. He but said aloud to
himself: “An ugly countenance yon, but I
ken they’d a’ run a dead-heat for the ugly
stakes.”
So up to the Trobriands went the Bird of
Paradise', a sulky ship; and Archie McAlis-
ter was glad to find another schooner, the
Crest of the Wave, his friend Foulmouth
Binns master, ready to be his consort south
to Samarai.
“’Tis a feckless crew I got yon, Foul-
mouth,” said McAlister, “an’ I’m verra glad
o’ a consorrt; forbye ma black sons o hell
are deporrtees fra Bund.vberg,. an’ the dam’
mishinries ha’ leffit them their ain devilry
an’ taught them the white man’s, tew. Mon,
there’s a great muddrer leaden’ ’em —a g’rilla
of a mon wi’ a scollop earmarked _oot o his
tope lup an’ twa big buck teeth itchin’ for
bluid on them. Foulmouth Binns, mon.
fower times atween Gizo an’ Kulamadau I
see him grinnin’ at me ahint the mast; an’
fower times I quelled him wi’ the carrm glint
o' a Gallowgate eye. But when I turrn ma
back I can feel his devil’s een tryin’ to burrn
a hole atween ma shoulther-blades; an’ I
ken his fingers itch to slip a wee knife atween
ma rubs. So it’s gude to hae a consorrt,
though he mightna be able to help me; it’s
comfortin’ ta think there’s a frien’.on the
high seas wi’ ye, even tho’ ye see him on’y
whiles on the tope o’ a sea to wind’ard. ’
Mainly in adjectives did Foulmouth Binns
state his solution of the difficulty, of Atta.
It included such exercises as putting a fist
down Atta’s throat and turning him inside
out, then leaving him in that darkness and
discomfort to turn his own skin to the out-
side again. Further, Foulmouth Binns
offered for two bottles of squareface to force
Atta’s feet into his own mouth and make him
eat himself from the toe upwards. But
McAlister rejected these extreme methods
for the settlement of disputes between Labor
and Capital; he inclined to Arbitration
(with a handspike) and Conciliation (with
a rope’s end and a heavy square-toed
Cossack boot administered with great force
to Atta’s ribs). He did not wish to damage
him too much, he said, nor lose him, as Atta
when in the humor was a fine worker.
Foulmouth considered McAlister soft-
hearted, and stated his belief in slang as
vivid as it was obscene. But when they left
Dobu, Foulmouth kept the Crest of the
Wave close on the course of the Bird of
Paradise, and McAlister was comforted by
his nearness; and. always kindly to his
crew except in the defence of discipline and
his own skin, he was that day more than
usually so.
All day they sailed together steadily
south; and ><:en the thick violet moonless
night closed in on them, McAlister saw the
masthead-light of the Crest of the Wave, and
it seemed even more friendly than a con-
sort’s light at sea. Foulmouth Binns saw
the stern lantern of the heavily-laden Bird
of Paradise gleaming as a wave lifted her
stern, and waited for its reappearance when
it sank as the ship’s counter thundered the
seas in the night. The night became filled
with stars; planet on planet, galaxy and
constellation, light without haste, heat or
passion falling softly to the sea like dew
upon the land. Fore and after masts cut it
with two spearpoints of black ; the full sails
blotted it like clouds. The immensity of it
all, the ruffled liquid plane of blackness torn
to phosphorescence by the rushing forefoot,
uplifted the heart of McAlister, still with
the religion of his ancestry—deep down, but
there. He stood by the wheel and watched
the wavering light of his consort; turned
and saw ahead the forefoot of the Bird of
Paradise rise like a rearing horse as if to
paw the sky, and the schooner slide down
again with her dirty weed-grown bottom
out of the water and her old stern lifting
for a look at the stars.
Something of childhood came back to
him as old and seemingly forgotten happi-
ness comes to the miserable when most
weary of life—which is when a disillusioned
man finds himself so strong that he almost
despairs of dying. He found himself mut-
tering the words of an old hymn as if he
were back in Sunday-school at Parkhead
or on the Kelvin side. He began very
reverently:—
“Code imives in a masteereeus weey
His wunners to perform.

Pills Give Lasting Benefit.
Sydney People Say So.
14 YEARS CURED,
Mr Lewis Williams, 602 Botany Road, Botany,
Sydney, says:—“l was a great sufferer with my
back, and the pain was at times so bad that I have
had to leave my work and go home. I also had
to walk about in a bent position, and I could not
straighten without increased suffering. I used
vaiious preparations, but only got slight temporary
re v V., dhlg of cures effected by Doan’s Back-
ache Kidney Pills, I decided to try them. One
bottle Gftsed the pain, and the second c >mpleted my
cure. I his did not happen yesterday, but about
seven years ago, and I have had no sign of back-
ache all that time, so it is not mere temporary re-
M, but a perfect cure. I am always advising
my friends to use Doan’s Backache Kidney Pills.
„ 5e this opportunity to publicly recommend
them.
Seven years later Mrs. Williams says:—“My
husband is still well, and has been free of backache
since Doan s Backache Kidney Pills cured him
fourteen years ago.”
5 YEARS CURED.
Mrs. W. Goldsmith, 47 Sutherland Street, Pad-
dington, Sydney, says :—“A member of my family
suffered a lot from kidney trouble, but a course of
I)oan s Backache Kidney Pills completely banished
the ailment, and there has been no return of any
distressing symptom since. The kidneys being
seriously disordered, caused violent pains in the
small of the back, and these were at times so bad
that it was almost impossible to move without
suffering agony. Dizzy turns and a tired and
weary feeling were other signs that proved the
kidneys were not working properly. Doan’s Back-
ache Kidney Pills w T ere brought under our ndtice
iis a reliable remedy, so we got a bottle without
delay, and they did so much good that we bought
some more, six bottles making a perfect cure.
Three years have elapsed since then, so the cure
has been well tested.”
Two years later Mrs. Goldsmith confirms the
above:—“The cure referred to still holds good, a
fact that speaks volumes for Doan’s Backache Kid-
ney Pills. Their curative powers are wonderful.”

He walked the deck of his ill-balanced
empire until the four bells of ten o’clock
sounded; then he put Sualefatoi to the
wheel, showed him the course by telling
aim keep a star —the lower pointer of
le , Cross dead ahead and to hand the star
and the wheel over to his reliefs; and then
he went to the little cabin, got into very
tun pyjamas and turned in and slept the
sleep of that good digestion which produces
an easy conscience.
He awoke an hour or more after midnight
leeling that all was not well. A mist had
come up on the sea and flattened it; the
yellow smoke curled forward. McAlister
took a glance astern for his consort and saw
not the masthead light of the Crest of the
u av ?j ! nit Heta Centauri astern when it
should have been ahead. Then the yellow
curtain of the mist dropped behind the ship
at aVi last star was smudged out.
McAlister went to the wheel and found it
pendulismg to the pull of the rudder now
helpless to the sea—two spokes to port, two
spokes to starboard, and back again. By
the sick glimmer of the binnacle light he
saw a black mass at the foot of the wheel
stanchions—Atta, the relieving steersman,
asleep. McAlister kicked the big Malaitan
ii.'to sensibility; then demanded why the
ship was off her course.
I losem that one star,” said the sullen
inaii. Then I been takem another.”
And leave the star asturrn and turn the
ship, right round, dom ye! ’Tis luck we’re
no in pilot wathers to hit a dom island.
Why you do that one?”
Sail one way all right—sail ’nother way
at a i 1 , re Pli e d Atta insolently, and
McAlister drove at the grinning face with
both fists and dropped Atta to the deck.
Ihen he turned and leaned over the stern-
rail trying to guess position.
The warm fog shrouded the world and
made him seem the ghost of himself; the
lsird of Paradise became a shadow ship,
made of black lace and crape; the schooner
had no way but that of the sluggish cur-
rent, the very ghost of a vagrant tide;
there was no motion of air or sea; the fog
was soft _ and opaque as silk—the world in
euthanasia, in an air like that of the room
ot a man a-dying!
As McAlister leaned over Atta moved

MnAr? 1 ' i S '! (ldon,y he arose, lifted
overboard' <IG tlllglls and beaved him
McAlister, in his haste to cry out to the
others as he fell, sank far and drank deeply
f.f tlie 1 5 ,0ra l k ea - As he came to the sur-
nnff’ „f he ? 1 f ht ’ as if to annoy him, sent a
s?® S f wind—short and irregular as light-
nng-flashes—to tear the fog curtain and
show him for a moment the Bird of Para-
dise, her sails hanging limply and blackly,
drawing away from her master, borne in the
hands of the hidden tide. McAlister called
for help, and saw Atta’s arm raised as if to
strike him down to the sea-floor. The Bird
of Paradise drew away as if the current that
bore ship and man sped the ship faster than
the man could drift. Then the yellow cur-
tains of the fog closed again, and McAlister
was alone, a white-bearded, bald old man
made of steel wire and whipcord, and so far
from fear that all he could feel was a blind
rage against Atta, not for attempting to kill
him so much as for the insolence of jettison-
ing him from his own ship as if he were a
rotten bunch of bananas. Mechanically he
had been swimming after the Bird of Para-
dise now vanished in the fog, and, feeling
that he must husband his strength for the
unknown number of hours that were to come
before- death or rescue, he turned over on
his back and floated on the almost imper-
ceptible rising and falling of the sea.
The fog came within less than a foot of
the water, so that it seemed to rest an inch
or two above his face; he could see nothing
but the deep mist covering him lightly and
warmly as a quilt of eiderdown. Its near-
ness became oppressive; as h e stared up at
the fog it seemed to settle closer to him ; he
turned on his breast again, glad that the
fog was on the back of his head and not so
immediately before his eyes. He felt no
danger of cramping, for the tropic sea was
thick and warm; but suddenly he thought
of sharks, turned in the water to meet the
treacherous, sneaking enemy face to face,
and suddenly remembered that in the deep
there is neither back nor front, nor east nor
west, but only an element producing an
offence more mobile than the eagle in the
air. The hair on his neck bristled ivith
horror. He had been overboard often in
shark waters, but never without an ark of
refuge to swim to; and now his ark had
drawn into the fog and he was hopelessly
alone. lie thought of praying and seeking
to end the suspense; welcoming death, as
the man who sees it inevitable and fears it
less than the torture that must come first.
I hen he put prayer from him as cowardice,
seeing the ways his life had known, and. in
that mind, began to fight again for life,
swimming as if in a race and calling loudly
to the mist.
Something brushed past him in the water.
He resigned himself to death, and swooned.
* * * *
Foulmouth Binns listened to McAlister*s
story and grinned. Atta, with a bleeding
back from the rope’s-end wielded by Capt.
McAlister, had been cast off from his com-
pulsory embrace of the fore-mast and now
lay in the fo’c’s’le of the Bird of Paradise,
his jellied flesh still twitching to the pun-
ishment that had passed.
T™ as earl y trainin’,” said Captain
McAlister, that was nigh makin’ me a wee
cock-angel, an’ no man. I swooned at the
ouch o drowned seaweed in the wather;
but twas no’ for long. I came to mysel’ an’
iound ma bones hadna been broacht
by any sharrk, an’ the weariness o’ the mist
was on me; an’ ma lungs seemed to breathe
the foggy air as thick as wather. Ah, Foul-
mouth! Foulmouth Binns! Had ye been
theyah, Gode w’u’d ha’ washed yeer wee
words clean an’ stoppit yeer damnin’ an’
blastin’ an’ bulgruddery in the clean hearrt
he had pit in yeer breast wi’ the fear of the
sharks cornin’ to tak’ a three-pund piece oot
o’ y’.”
Said Foulmouth Binns: “Get on with the
tale.”
“I trembled there before the Lorrd in the
fog; the breath came oot o’ the mist an’
clammy it was an’ the wind o’ death in it;
an’ strange uncanny movings in the wather
below as if the blind de’ils o’ the slime o’
the sea-floor reachet up to tak’ me by the
heels. I couldna’ swim—could only" float
there like a dynamited fish, belly up, alive
an’ swowning. In my half-daft thochts I
thocht o Sun’ay-schule an’ me mither mould-
erin’ in the kirkyard by Castel Cary. I
thocht o’ ma kirk an’ the preacher’s worrds
Predestination, faith and worrks.’ I
hadna ony faith, an’ ma worrks before the
Lord haena been anything to brag aboot,
an’ I wudna like tae see mony o’ them in
the Scotsman or the Glaisgie Herald; an’
for what I was predestined on’y Gode an’
the sharrks might ken.
Then I tried to say a wee bit prayer.
Mon, I couldna be humble! I could on’y
think of the gran’ idea o’ Gode; I could
on y remember : ‘Praise Him all ye hills,
and piaise Him all things that live; praise
Him ye seas an’ all that therein are’ (in-
cludin, o’ course, the dom sharrks) ; ‘praise
Him ye mountains an’ all the threasures o’
the snow.’ Whiles I said to maseP :
(lode muves in a masteereeus weev
His wunners to perforrm!
An’ then I forgot the third wee line; but
maybe the Lorrd doesna’ know any better
liimseP, and the fourth line is ‘An’ rides
u P° n storrm.’ Then the wather was
couldther, the bluid left my feet; I felt I
was slippen oot o’ life like dead wrrack
gangin’ to sea in a spring tide. So I said
to masel : Airchie McAlister, I wilna bear
anither pang; I’ll just say ma wee bit
prayer and pit ma hands ower ma heid, an’
gang doon an’ suffer nae mair.’
“I couldna’ think o’ a prayer, but Gode
cam to me in the wather and brought me
shame. An’ ’stead o’ prayin’ I said to
mysel, oot loud, speakin’ to the fog that was
now toimentit by little winds that stayed
but a minute and were gone: ‘Airchie
McAlister! Ye’re sixty-fower year old. an’
for fifty-eight o’ them y’ haena thocht o’
Bode. Yeve walked yeer ain wild way, an’
had yeer fun an’ yeer wee drammie, an’ yeer
by-drinkin s, an’ never a flower o’ spring-
time passed ye by. Ye’ve walked the worrld
an made the South Seas obscene wi’
screechin an square-face gin; an’ ’twasna’
yeer fault, but a good mither, that made ye
no so bad as Foulmouth Binns.’
- !” said Foulmouth.
“b oulmouth, but cleanheart—an’ Gode
will foigie yeer swearin’ becos ye never
turrned awa’ from a friend. An’ I said:
‘Airchie McAlister, shame to live as ye ha’
done, an’ then greet an’ whimper as soon’s
ye’re, in a wee bit trouble. Die if ye wull to
save torrment, Airchie McAlister, but dinna
think ye’re a marthyr. Dinna pray; Gode
has forgotten the soond o’ yeer voice. Swim
an’ fecht as ye ha’ done all yeer life. Ye

Mon! wi’ that my hearrrt tightened up its
strings, an’ ma’ sinews steeled, an’ the bluid
ran sweetly to ma feet. Gode knew that
every crupple has his ain way o’ walkin’, an’
that bletherin’ a lot o’ prayer isna’ ma way.
The fog foldet before ma eyes; all the little
gauzies o’ the mist lifted like the eurrtains
o’ the play-actors; an’ a big gowd eye in
the sky to ma left showed me the east. A’
the mists sneaket awa’ before the honest
sunrise; and there was yeer ship, Foul-
mouth Binns, searrchin’ for yeer consort an’
found her masther in the wather.
‘‘Before eight bells we had ma ship again,
an’ Atta has had the flesh cut off his back to
make him a gude bairn. An’ that was
betther than prayer for the resignation to
sink wi’. Better than dein’ ’twas to see the
gowden sunrise, an’ ma mate Foulmouth
Binns; an’ praise God whiles I was cuttin’
to pieces wi’ a rope’s-end the dirrthy
mudderin’ black carcase yon !”
“ !” said Foulmouth Binns.
“ ’Twasna’ that! Faith I had in mysel;
worrks was in my swimmin’ till the dawn ;
an’ predestination brot me back to ma own
ship,. praisin’ God an’ listenin’ to yeer
damnin’ an’ blastin’ and bulgruddery.”
“I’d ha’ gone crook if I well
hadn’t picked you up, Archie,” said Foul-
mouth Binns.

[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
IN one glorious, gleaming hour,
I pluckt Life, the passion-flower
In a musk-rose scented bower.
Prest it to my naked soul,
Felt its sepals round me roll
Like a seraph's aureole.
llow I scorn the world’s derision,
I, who’ve seen Love’s splendid vision!
Gazing in her veiled eyes
I beheld the twilight rise,
Drank the truth beyond the skies !
Holding her dear hand in mine
Humbly knelt at Godhead’s shrine,
Found the Trust and Faith divine.
One with the eternities,
When upon my lips her kiss
Made me free of all that is!
I have drawn from Death the sting ;
I have lost Time’s reckoning;
Love has crowned me. made me King!

BcechamsPills
may be relied upon, at all times, to exercise a tonic,
cleansing, healing influence upon the digestive organs.
A sensible use of this well-known specific is generally
all that is needed to relieve and remove those disorders
of the stomach liver - and bowels, which are always
associated with dyspepsia in any form. Beeeham's Pills
are unfailing as a corrective and invaluable as a safe
stimulant of that important organ, the liver, upon the
efficient action of which so much depends. As a cure
for constipation and for removing its attendant discom-
forts and dangers there is no more reliable remedy. In
fact, as an aid to health generally, the judicious use of
Beecham s Pills is strongly recommended. They are
