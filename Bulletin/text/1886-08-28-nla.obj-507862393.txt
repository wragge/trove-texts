Drink.
The Bulletin .
SATURDAY, AUGUST 28, 1886.
The Sydney Morning Herald has recen - .ly
compiled a good many facts relating to the
drink traffic of the world, and generally
they seem to bear out the idea that tfce
world drinks too much. The w-rid drinks
to drown its sorrow, perhaps, but by a
strange perversion of effort the world makes
its chief, it deepest, its most shameful sor-
row by its drink. Drink to all men of
Scandinavian or Teuton blood is a greater
curse than kings; drink, settling down in a
cold and comfortless climate, is a ten thou-
sand times worse and more enduring enemy
than cholera. And the drink habit bred in
the cold climate, incorporated with the
nature of the oold-ollme man, brought with
him to this genial; south, and indulged here
more freely, and with large opportunities, is
the direst plague he knows. Drink in Aus-
tralia is the Devil.

About five millions a year the two colonies
of New South Wales and Victoria pay for
drink. That quantity comes through bond
and is what gets the name of “honest
liquor.” How much is brewed in shanties,
what;per oentage is added in watering, we
have no statistics to show. The statistics of
shanty-poison are for the most part under-
ground, or in the maws of the crow or the
eagle or the dingo, or in lunatic asylums or
gaols; and of judicious waterings, in the
puffed and ephemeral prosperity of the land-
lord, and the jewellery and gaudery of his
good wife and worthy widow. The value of
all these have to be added on to the price of
the wholesale estimates, and the legiti-
mate profits made by the retailer a hun-
dred per cent, might cover all. If we double
the five millions we shall probably come
somewhere near the price paid by the two
colonies for liquor, and, indeed, working by
a very fair system of average, and allowing
nothing for adulteration, the Herald makes
the annual drink bill of New South Wales
millions.
« ■ «
Take that sum as the actual hard cash
paid by New South Wales in every year for
drink. The philosophical bottle-a-day man
may say ; “ It is in no way startling—how
much do wo pay for food and raiment ?
Drink is the second, if not the first, neces-
sity of life. It we could live on air we might
keep all our millions.” We must look into
such a reply as this ; we must get on solid
ground as to the actual necessity for drink,
and the service rendered by drink before we
proceed to attack that most ungodly sur-
plus to which hangs the great tail of our
national and individual woe.
* * *
The general result of drink is summed up
tersely in the phrase, “ Dutch Courage.”
The zest, the hilarity, the bombast, the riot,
are not exactly your own. In vino veritas
is a foul slander; for it is not the whole man
who speaks, but a part of him. Like the
“ wicked broth ” Luoillia brewed for
Ltjobbtius, alcohol tickles the brute brain
within the man, giving him at the first
touch, the frolic, the abandon, the whole-
hearted joy which characterises the merrier
moments of creatures in whom is no sense
of responsibility. And there is little harm
in this. The brute predominates in the
great majority of men. The doctor uses
alcohol to soothe, to cneer, at times to feed
the brute. And if alcohol were kept in the
pharmacopoeia and out of the house-cup-
board it would serve many and waste none.
If every man, indeed, would be his own
physician in the matter it would be well;
but that is just what he cannot be. He 1
does not know himself, he does not under-
stand the drug: and so comes madness and
suicide. “ But not at first and not without
benefit,” says cur philosophical toper. And
we answer by no means. We know, and are
prepared to admit how sad the world would
be if there were were no more “ glorious
vintage of champagne,” nor more “ Health
to all good lasses,” or “Jolly good fellows,”
or “Auld Lang Syne.” The world would
not be so very well then, but these need
only be the results of the medicinal doses.
Four per cent, of the total cost would pur-
chase them all. And what is bought with
E. W. O’SULLIVAN, M.L.A.
fd
the balance ? The man who once opens his
eyes, and in intelligent and unprejudiced
fashion seeks an answer to this question, is
startled ere his quest is done. The 95 per
cent, of four and half millions sterling
annually invested by one million of people
is but the stepping-stone to enquiry. The
dreary, the horrid landscape broadens as he
ascends. He looks across a field of battle,
he sees a thousand he knew as acquaintances,
and hundreds of thousands he knows as
fellow-men, bound by imbecility, fettered
by crime; bodies rotting, bones bleaching,
hangmen and doggers busy, years wasting,
homes ruined, the abomination of desola-
lation with vulture-like beak and talons
tearing at the vitals of humanity, and in
letters of blood from tip to tip of its sable
pinions the word—Drink!

Well! The pause is natural as necessary, for
If this blaoK bird appears so foul and so
plain, what is to be done but up with the
total abstinence gun and shoot? There
would, indeed, be no other duty, if, by shoot-
ing, the creature migh tbe slain; or if slay-
ing him, mankind should be released. But
how long has the shooting by really capable
marksmen been going on ? How frequently
from pulpit and from platform have we
seen great guns firing; how with trumpet
and drum, and banner and uniform, have
armies paraded all the streets of all the
cities of the world ? What oaths have been
registered against him, what pledges given
to exterminate him, and yet how absolutely
unmoved, and immoveable he sits upon his
prey I

Really pitiful, when seriously oontem-
plated, are the long rows of figures, the
bloodless, passionless, deadly statistics, ar-
rayed against all the fanfarronade of the
teetotal crusades. A little more prosperity
in any year, and a little more drink, and
also a considerable increase in the crimes
which come through drink. A little de-
pression and a little curtailment. Through
both periods the temperance drum beats, as
through the drought and the flood time the
parson prays; and with a similar non-effect.
What then ?
• * *
Matthew Abnold, in the grandest sermon
layman ever preached, tells how a religious
newspaper, “giving an account or the crowd
at Epsom on Derby day and of all the vice
and hideousness of that crowd, turned sud-
denly round to Professor Hcxunr and
asked him how he proposed to cure all this
vice and hideousness without religion ?” “ I
confess,” he says, “I feel disposed to ask
the asker this question : ‘ And how do you
propose to cure it with such a religion as
yours ? How is the ideal of life so unlovely,
so unattractive, so incomplete, so narrow,
so far removed from a true and satisfying
ideal as is the life of your religious organi-
sation to conquer and transform all this vice
and hideousness ?’ " In somewhat similar
fashion do the total abstinence people turn
upon us as advocates of none but liberal re-
forms; and in precisely similar terms do we
begin our reply, and, indeed, can find no
better way of completing it than to join in
the advocacy of the apostle for “ sweetness
and light.” Give us sweetness and light,
teach us from the beginning to love sweet-
ness and light, and we shall have no desire
for the biting zest, the lurid glare, of the
curse of drink.
* * «
We cannot follow the teacher line upon
line fitting his sermon to our cause in this
matter. He deals with a general, while we
have to do with a particular matter. It is
not the sweetness and light which are to re-
form mankind we desire, but that portion
of each which, suiting our nature and our
circumstances, will help to render this drink
desire innocuous. Now to begin at the be-
ginning, it may be said that we drink be-
cause in drink we find satisfaction. Some
want or other is appeased by drink, any
want from the dulness of an unoccupied
moment to the last pang of a ruined life.
And will the want cease if the means of
satisfaction are taken away ? Total absti-
nence advocates assume so much, and on that
rook make shipwreck of all their plans. The
want is part of the human nature, and will
only be satisfied by wholesome food. The
craving of the want is the expression of the
natural human desire for the human heri-
tage of sweetness and light.
* * •
Ana how vainly it craves, and how con-
stantly, how madly, do those who should
satisfy it, offer it stones for bread, or vinegar
mingled with gall, for drink? The boy wants
vent for the boyish life that surges through
his veins, and he is offered the text-covered
walls of the “Young Workman’s Club.” The
youth and the maiden desire to dance to-
gether through the twilight and the evening
hours, and the voice of authority to them is,
“Sunder; get you to your School of Arts,
and you to your Young Woman’s Christian
Home or to your garret.” The workman de-
sires to quench his mighty thirst, to stretch
his brawny limbs, to rest amid such genial
influences as his coarse nature can appre-
ciate and enjoy. What’s for him? There is
nothing in the world for him but the four
walls of his cottage and the foul air of his
slum. The usages of society provide for him
a horse’s life-work and sleep—and for his
wife, for the young mother so fast growing
old, such hopeless joyless slavery, that ’tis
everlasting marvel to men who look into the
essential facts of life, that in multitudes of


oases she is not driven to despair and to—
drink.
* * *
What hope have they of the slightest in-
stalments of the meanest elements of sweet-
ness and light ? Their lives are all dark,
and for their enlightening, they are offered
by their betters some few caverns where
they may creep and hide.
m m 9
There is no hope in the caverns or the cur-
tailments of life; both arise in the minds
of men who know not man, but some of
his infirmities. Hope will only dawn when
the whole breadth of being, and envi-
ronment of circumstance are seriously
and practically contemplated by those
whose positions of leadership enable them
to shape the destinies of their fellows. You
drink, do you? and why do you drink?
That is the way the question must be ap-
proached. “You must not drink,” is absurd
as “ you must not die.” What am Ito do if I
do not drink ? is the question the moderate
consumer puts to social reformer and legis-
lator, and gets for answer —What? Some-
thing just about as reasonable as the “ Pro-
testantism of the Protestant religion, and
the Dissidenoe of Dissent” which the most
cultured Nonconformists offer the world for
“sweetness and light.”
« * •
We have already alluded to the stones
which are given as bread to the hungry
people, but if it be asked what should be
substituted for them we are not prepared in
a single article to supply an answer. This
much, however, we know and freely say:
Those people, guilty of no excesses, who
drink moderately and live wholesomely, do
not fill up the vacuum of their being with
Bible-olasses, or evening science lectures,
or diligent study. They do not recreate
within whitewashed, text-plastered walls.
They, young and old, youths and maidens,
solace themselves with music, dance in
their gay saloons, lounge on their balconies,
wander about their gardens, take all the
pleasures which “society” affords, and —
just imagine!—we pay a Governor £lO.OOO a
year to make, before all things, a focussing
point or a radiating centre for that
“society.”
• * *
“And do you propose,” asks self-satisfied
cynicism, “to admit the whole of the un-
washed dram-drinking multitude into so-
ciety, to give them all balconies and gardens,
dancing-saloons and ices and champagne?
And do you think that when so provided,
they would quit the corner pub. and the
gutter?” Our answer is: We would en-
deavour to give them all that is their own.
In the first place, all their earnings, the full
results of their own labour; and, in the
second, all the sweetness and light of life
they were able to enjoy. Yes, we would
burn a good many state candles and brew a
good deal of State lager, Bun®, the brewer’s,
protest notwithstanding. We would pro-
vide a good deal of State music, and make
that glorious breadth of garden ground from
Mrs. Macquabie’s Chair to Mount Rennie
bright and beautiful as any Potts Point
estate for three hours of every fair evening
in the year. We would endeavour to get
the useful 4 per cent, of the liquor so mixed
as to be innocuous as agreeable, and gra-
dually weaning the people from their
brutal excesses and so saving for them and
to them the millions now flung actually as
pearls to swine we would hope to see them
a little cleaner, a little purer, a little freer
in every year ; more inclined to co-operate
for their own good, and less inclined may
be to support Potts and Darling Pointers
and the select shows of Government House.
* * •
And do we really expect this sort of thing
to take place ? Are we not convinced by
repeated failures of attack, of the fallacies
we advance ? We tilt against the humbugs
of the time, but the humbugs still flourish.
We satirise the follies of a Governor, but
the flag Hies, and the multitude roars
applause as he passes along the street. We
denounce the lash, but the lash still
swings : the gallows, but the hideous black
beam still projects; the court’s impotence
and the laws delay, but impotence still sits
in the place of power, and hearts are broken
while lawyers wrangle and grow fat!
■ ■ ■
We must answer with our apostle, and
say that “this, our sentiment for beauty
and sweetness (and our hatred of hypocrisy
and fraud) have been at the bottom of our
attachment to so many beaten causes, of our
opposition to so many triumphant move-
ments. . . . We have not won our battles
—we have not carried our main points—but
we have told silently upon the mind of the
country, we have prepared currents of feel-
ing which sap our adversaries’ position
when it seems gained, and we have kept up
our own communication with the future.”
And these, after all, are the great boasts
and the sure foundations of practical re-
form. ’Tis the opening of the human mind
that kills the human vice, and the granting
of the full human heritage that sates the
craving which, fed with vno liquor amid
foul surroundings, becomes madness, surely,
if not quickly, as the shipwrecked mariner’s
thirst temporarily relieved by the brine of
the tea,
PLAIN ENGLISH.
The Gold Tribute to China.
A Chinaman never changes a sovereign. He gives
silver for gold, and from the date of the exchange
the sovereign is withdrawn from circulation and
withdrawn also from the currency of the colony,
to be no more used until it rings on the counters
of the money-changers, or mingles with hundreds
of others in the melting-pot of some Chinese town.
That is if it be an Australian-coined sovereign. If
it be the product of the English mint it is hoarded
and exchanged for a Sydney or Melbourne sove-
reign, before its Mongolian owner sails for his
native land, for Australian sovereigns being
alloyed with silver instead of copper, bring
a higher price in China than those of English
coinage. Prior to the departure of the Chinese
mail-boat, the Chinamen who have determined to
desist from further plunder of Australia and re-
turn to their own homes, go to some of the banks
or Chinese merchants, and, handing over their
hoarded notes and “dragon” sovereigns, receive
good Australian gold instead. No Chinaman leaves
Australia—except as a oorpse-without taking
heavy tribute of coin of the realm with him. And
these various sums reach a huge total dur-
ing the year. One Sydney bank hands over
5000 Australian sovereign per month in this
way, while another estimates its monthly ex-
change at 3000 sovereigns. From the other banks
statistics are not obtainable, but, presuming that
their transactions in this particular line only come
to 4000 per month in the aggregate, there would
then be a monthly total of 13,000 and a yearly ex-
change of 156,000 sovereigns. But this sum, huge
though it be, does not represent one-half of the
colony’s loss, for during the jwhole time of his
stay the Chinaman has been laying by all the
Australian mint sovereigns he could obtain,
and, as these latter form the major part
of the gold currency, the sum of the
sovereigns thus secreted must be greater
than the amount of those changed. It may, there-
fore, be fairly estimated that 300,000 Australian
sovereigns are thus taken annually from N.S.W,
It would saem that our colonial mints are run in
the special Interest of the yellow-skinned misers.
Australian coinage is made .more pure than Eng-
lish, that the Mongol may profit thereby. And if
it be asked what equivalent the Chinese render for
this yearly tribute, the answer would be impossible
to find. To take away money without rendering
equivalent, is a State robbery—legal though it may
be. It is time that this looting of this nation were
stopped, whether by export duty on gold or other
sterner and more effectual means. Think of it,

The Cat at Home.
One of the cases which plumb the abysmal depths
of our national depravity was that of the
Reynolds family, heard in the Sydney magis-
trates’ court last week. A child had been
fouly and vilely done to death, and when
her poor body was exposed to the 13 In-
telligent gentlemen of the jury, such marks
were found as usually follow the judicial torture
of the " eat.” The child was about 13, and on her
sides were scars, “ as of flogging,” the doctor said,
and the father, being examined, admitted that a
cat-o’-nine-tails was part of the furniture of his
house. He denied, of course, that it had been
used in this particular instance, but that he
possessed such an instrument and used it
foi the discipline of his family was not
disputed. What a light the admission sheds on
the far-reaching influences of our advanced legis-
lation! “ Am I not right in following the law ? ”
says the judicial parent, as he knots the whipcord
and cuts the flesh ? And, by-and-bye, when
grosser brutality is bred by his brutal punishment
he may set himself to build a gallows in his back-
yard, and with all order and ceremony carry out a
private execution. The man does but follow
Illustrious examples, the teaching of his betters,
as he might say. Or is it possible that he is not
exactly this brute, but a man profoundly im-
pressed with all the posibilities of life, and
determined that his children shall be well pre-
pared for them all ? It was held by great
teachers of the Middle Ages that all children
should be disciplined by corporal punishment
because it was amongst the chances of life tbat
they would some day be required to undergo " the
torture,” boot or rack, or scourge ; and it was
well that they should suffer with dignity. Our re-
markable laws, which really place men in the
hands of any plotting strumpet or lascivious brat’
bring the possibility of our modern torture of
whipcord-flogging to every man’s door, and this
disciplinarian who made the regulation-cat a
household implement may have been only desirous
of training his offspring to a familiarity with a'l
the chances of life in New South Wales.

The New South Wales Army.
Mr. Barley, in the house of the Ancients, pitches
down a bombshell filled with charges against
“ Our Army.” Our army is not at all what it ought
to be, says the learned gentleman. Our artillery
are not equal to the honourable company of Eng-
land, and ’tls doubtful if we could blow a half-
dozen Russians out of the water if they should
take a notion to run up our open channel, keeping
well under the guns of the forts. We were to have
had the nucleus of a splendid flghtlng-foree out of
that Contingent. Seven hundred perfectly-trained
me», with the smell of powder in their nostrils and
a splash of black blood on their clothes, were to
hare been real fiery leaven to all our military
organisation for ever. But all that remains of the
Contingent now is the meek little donkey at the
Zoo, and the army is no more leavened than Pass-
over cake. What shall we do ? Start another Con-
tingent ? Send a thousand men to Russia to teaoh
the Czar that he will have Australia to reckon
with if he meddles too rashly with those princi-
palities? Mr. Barley does not suggest any-
thing of that sort; he seems to want a Roy*i
Commission, which means a few thousand
pounds spent in deliberation, some hundreds
in recording and printing, and as result a
document to grow mouldy in the lumber-room
of the Colonial Secretary’s department. We
1 want men. not commissions, Qood, trained, and
experienced butchers—if we seriously intend to
ight, and not whipper-snappers and dunderheads
who chance to be related to families well placed
in “ colonial sassiety,” and there has never been
any difficulty in obtaining such men as these.
Dozens of them have dropped down from India
and China, and gone out of sight in divers ways*
Nobody was to be propitiated by setting them to
do their own work, and so they were pushed aside,
and the scions of the old stock got in. And how
do we stand now ? If the Royal Commission
Is appointed, and if its report Is a truthful declara-
tion of actual conditions we shall find our Per-
manent Force the most costly and least efficient in
the world, and our torpedo system a matter of luck
and chance. With all our cockorowlng and fili-
bustering, our playing with Imperialism, our ac-
tually menacing and insulting great nations, we
are absolutely naked and helpless, and if our loud
and silly words ever lead to blows we should be
crushed in the grip of any Power as jelly-fish In
the arm of an octopus. We do need reform
if we mean fight, and the best reform
would be the abolition of “our army;”
and then the drilling of every boy at school
and the training of every man to use arms
well enough to stand by and defend his own. Not
to fight for fads. The position of a good Australian
should be: “Island for Australia, do you what
you will with Eastern questions and African
troubles, balances of power, and Teuton or Sclav
dominations; those are your affairs; the good
government and security of this continent are
mine, and he who comes here against me comes
not as a foeman, but as a thief, a murderer, a
burglar, and as such we shall regard him.” We
shall not require much gold laco or society polish
for that sort of battle, the proper condition of
preparedness.for which is the best guarantee that
it will never be fought.

Sunday Concerts and Sunday Traffic.
A renewal of the conflict between Sabbatarians
and Secularists in Sydney seems to be rapidly ap-
proaching, and, if the former party does not shun
the collision, must inevitably take place. We use
the cant terms to designate the parties. Both
names are incorrect, but there are now no other
terms with which to replace these. The cause of
conflict Is found in the increasing popularity of
Sunday-night concerts within the city. Legally
the Secularists are entirely in the wrong. Ancient
statutes, passed in times when the Church was
paramount, forbid in the plainest of terms the
holding of such entertainments on Sunday, and
more recent enactments prescribe penalties to be
visited upon those who take part in, as well as all
who attend such performances. According to
clear law, there is hardly a theatre in Sydney of
which the license could not be rightfully can-
celled, while the audiences, by the same laws, are
liable to be classed as “ rogues and vagabonds.”
Therefore the Sabbatarian party, in desiring to
stop these concerts, are legally right. But a
power higher than law is as clearly against them—
the power, public epinion, which makes the law.
L-iws are only potent so long as they are sustained
by public approbation. So far back as the time of
Henry VII., Judges have been found who re-
fused to enforce Statute law because, as they said,
“the practice is, and ever hath been, to the con-
trary.” The case is similar with regard to these
concerts. The law against such performances is
practically obsolete, and could only be enforced
despite-not with the assistance of-public opinion.
To enforce the law would be to raise up new
enactments to expunge those now bearing on the
subject. The colony has forged ahead of its
Statute-Book, and as the people will not and can-
not go back, the next thing will be to make the
law harmonise with the results of that progress.
Divested of side issues, the question is simply
whether all men shall have liberty to follow each
the dictates of his own conscience, or whether
coercion shall be applied for the purpose of mak-
ing men holy. The Sabbatarians plead for the
suppression of Sunday concerts because the latter
are “ an offence to a Christian community,” but
apparently forget that a church may be equally
an offence to mm whose consciences lead them to
look upon modern sectarian religion as an empty
sham. Bach soction of the oommun.ty may be
right, but neither is justified in an attempt to coerce
the consciences of the other. “ Let every man
go to Heaven his own road,” must be the national
motto regarding this matter. And in connec-
tion with this subject, it is worthy of notice that the
churches, having sown the wind, are now reaping
the whirlwind. The Anglicans and Romanists pos-
sess magnificent churches and cathedrals within
the city, and these buildings cannot be filled unless
the suburbs contribute their quota to the attend-
ance. To do away with Sunday trains would
mean insolvency to these places of worship, there-
for the Sabbatarians cannot urge that Sunday
should be regarded as a day of complete rest.
Their request is that the Secularists should be
prevented from any “ Sabbath desecration,’*
while they, the petitioners, are unmolested in
tbeir own particular line of Sabbath-breaking.
Had it not been for the Church people no subur-
ban trains need ever have been run on Sunday,
but the religious ones obtained trains to attend
churches, and then secularists were wicked enough
to use those same trains as a means of attending
lectures and concerts. If the Sabbatarians were
sincere, they would agitate for the abolition of
Sunday-passenger traffic, but this they dare not
do lest the cathedrals should run short of
revenue, and aristocratic Sydney churches be left
empty and desolate.

Another King 1 Gone.
Another European Sovereign is gone. The
hard-fighting Prince of Bulgaria, the only orna-
ment of the “cheeky” house of Battenberg, and
almost the only monarch In Europe who deserved
to be anything better than a hodman, has been
dethroned and ejected from his principality,
without even a chance to strike a blow in his own
defence, and the nation of slaves whom he was
trying to raise to the dignity of free men are re-
ported to have “ implored the goodwill of the
Czar on bended knees,” Prince Alexander has
held his precarious dignity for seven stormy
years. In 1879 he was elevated to the Crown,
which, under Simeon and Samuel, had been one
of the greatest in Eastern Europe, but. which the
1 feeble barbarians who succeeded them lost to the
conquering Turk. He was appointed that he
might be the bondman of Russia, and thus keep
the road open to Abdul-Hamid’s capital, but he
astounded the whole Continent by throwing off
this yoke, and governing Bulgaria for the sake of
bis own people instead of for the sake of the Czar.
For some time it seemed as if he were to succeed
in the mission which he had assumed. The Sultan,
despot as he is, recognised the great good
whicn his rival was trying to accomplish, and even
when Alexander annexed the province of
Eastern Boumelia he refused to draw the sword
against him, while the Prince of Bulgaria laboured
hard to establish a free nation in the midst of bar-
barlsm and tyranny. Russian influence for a
time went down to zero in the Turkish peninsula*
and then the Austrian Kaiser, thinking the oppor-
tunity a good one for plunder and usurpation*
hired Milan Obrbnovitch, the murderous King
of Servla, to be his prophet in Macedonia, and
made a feeble attempt to conquer the little Balkan
principality by proxy. The tyrant of Belgrade,
already known as one of the vilest cowards In
Europe, opened a campaign which is now a matter
of history. Commanding the largest army that
ever followed a Servian King since the days of the
gallant Lazarus, he burst like a torrent into Bul-
garia, only to see bis array beaten small and seat*
tered like chaff by Alexander and a mere handful
of soldiers. This was the crowning achievement
of the German prince, and bad his people been
worthy of him, he bade fair to create a free and
powerful nation in Eastern Europe, and build up a
great state on the ruins of the effete Ottoman
power. But Russia never forgot or forgave the
loss of her vassal, and Muscovite intrigues have
been carried on without ceasing, in order to com-
pass his downfall. To a’l appearance, they have
now been successful. Prince Alexander, the only
sovereign whom Europe can ill spare, has been
arrested in the presence of his own army, deposed
without a struggle, and ejected from his princi-
pality, while the people whom he set free from
their chains—the people whom he raised only a
year ago to the pinnacle of glory, and who cried
“ all hall ” to their deliverer, now send a deputa-
tion to a Russian agent to beg on bended knees
for the favour of the Czar. Yet the Bulgarians
were once a nation of heroes, the bravest and most
free of European races. But centuries of Turkish
despotism have broken their spirit. They can no
longer stand without their familiar chains; they
miss the fetters to which they have so long been
accustomed; and, being freed from the yoke of
the sonS of Othman, they hold out their hands to
the Russian bonds, which will shortly be riveted
on, unless some one interposes to save this de-
graded nation from accomplishing its own destruc-
tion. If anyone desires to know how low man can
sink when brutalised by a long and atrocious
tyranny, he has only to look at Bulgaria to-day,
and he will And his answer there,

T he Yellow Pnp Again.
“ The Education Act in dangerl” was the rallying
cry of the Orange faction in the New South Wales
Assembly on Friday night last, when a motion
was submitted by Mr. Stokes to allow children
attending schools other than State schools to
travel free on the railway-lines. But that cry has
lost much of its force, although Messrs. Foster,
Rbnwiok, Lloyd, Abigail, Neild, and Parkbs
(the same old lot) worked it for all that it was
worth. In. reality, the motion did not endanger
the Act in the slightest degree—it simply was
designed to remove a glaring anomaly now exist-
ing. At present the State accepts the teaching
obtained at private' and denominational schools as
exempting the parents and guardians of children
attending such schools from the penalties pre-
scribed by the compulsory clauses of the
Public Instruction Act. The existence and use-
fulness of private schools is acknowledged, but
the State places them under a disability by handi-
capping them to the extent of the railway fares.
If a monopoly of education is claimed by the
State, it should be enforced; if, on the contrary,
other schools, controlled either by private persons
or corporations, are recognised, facilities similar
to those conceded to State schools should certainly
be allowed. To do otherwise is to apply limited
coercion to the consciences, or at least in-
clinations, of a portion of the community. This
motion, if passed, would have removed existing
inequality and relieved the disability referred o,
that it has not passed is chiefly owing to the fact
that a Dutch King once ruled over a _ B “ ali
and distant group of islands called the Fnite
Kingdom.

Miss Adele Grant, the American lady who

Mr. George Urquhart, a pioneer squatter,

The Queen’s appearance at the late Aider-

It being of the eleven-three-farthings’ descrip-

Queen Victoria “commands” Patti (who
has been publicly living in a state of adultery for

seems to be but an inconsistent sham after all.

A London society writer announces that

Queen Victoria is trying to get up a match
between the Duchess of Albany, widow of tne

Duke Louis of Hesse, who, it will be remembered,
after burying Princess Alloa married Madama de

The Mayor of Sydney, as the universe
knows, has received an “acknowledgement” from
Queen Victoria of the Council’s congratulations
re Jubilee Year. We forgot to remark last week
that this Is only another proof of that womanly
sympathy with all classes which has made her
Majesty’s name loved and respected, in cottage
and palace alike. God save the Q ueen!
Everyone has, or ought to have, heard
that most famous of all English hunting songs
whose refrain is, “D’ye ken. John Peel? ” Well,
John Woodcock Graves, the writer and composer
of “John Peel ” died in Tasmania last week, aged
100 years. He was a native ot Cumberland,
England. Let us hope that, with a sense of the
eternal fitness of things, they sang “ John Peel ” at
the old man’s grave.
Hon. B. R. Beliliost, of Hong Kong, has
risen to sudden fame. He covered a card—the ace,
we presume—with tearful Primrose gush, and sent
it to England, requesting that it might be gummed
on Beaconsfleld’s empty pew in Hughenden
Church, and now Truth asks who this distant out-
pouring soul may be. And the card was not
gummed, after all. They did not want Hong
Kongese gush in the sacred edifies.
Poor Battenberg has reached the lowest
depths of degradation. Queen Victoria is going
to promote him to the rank of an Asiatic nigger,
and as he is tired of being a white man, he bails
the prospect with joy. Mrs O'Guelph wanted to
pitchfork him into the Guards, but there was so
much opposition that he is now to be made
colonel of an Indian regiment instead. Nobody
expects Bat. to sniff the battle from afar—he is
only to sniff the salary.
The Illawarra (N.8.W.) Mercury has as-
certained that Mr Quong Tart, the Chinese philan-
thropist, of Sydney, is of Scottish descent. An
ancestor of his, who wore the Caledonian petticoat,
fled to China after breaking somebody's head, and
astonished the natives by his attire. His name
was M'Pherson, equivalent in Chinese to Hong
Chew, but ne was immediately dubbed “ Tartan,”
and the second syllable being afterwards worn
away by friction against the Great Wall, the name
has ultimately been reduced to Tart.
The Rev. John M‘Neil, of Waver]ey, re-
potted to the Melbourne police the other day that
a Gladstone bag belonging to him had been stolen
from the Spencer-street railway station. Among
other things the bag contained, were some ser-
mons. This at once points out the culprit to
have been a brother clergyman. These Victorian
ministers are sharks for stealing sermons. We
hope the publication of this fact will be a warn-
ing to other Sydney clerics to leave their ser-
mons at home when they go to Melbourne.
J. L. M‘Galium, who originally put the
N.S.W. authorities in possession of information re
the great railwav frauds, complains that, despite
repeated solicitations, he has been unable to get
even his actual travelling expenses from the
Government, though he is so poor as not to be
in a position to pay for the medical asiistance of
which he is sorely in need. M'Callum, it is under-
stood, wants neither Government employment
nor other reward; his grievance seems to be that
he is actually a loser through having done the
State a service.
Mr, n. J. Buobland, of Sydney Exchange,
might, had he chosen, have made some coin out of
the Sydney D.T., which the other day Inadvert-
ently confounded bis name with that of another
Mr. Buckland who has just now a small financial
misunderstanding with the N.S.W. railway
authorities. Which recalls the fact that a long
time ago one F. J. Buckland was charged at Mel-
bourne with stealing sausages, out of which pan-
tomimic Incident the friends of another F. J.
Buckland (who manages a bank at Mansfield)
evolved much humour.
“ Mr. Frederick Young, of the Royal Colo-
hinl Institute, proposes a roving commission to
visit the colonies and report on the question of
Imperial Federation.’’ Mr. Frederick Young afore-
said is an effeminate, well-moaning, md-maidlah
person with a squeaky voice. He used to be a
coppersmith in the city of London, never was in
Australia in his life, and. notwithstanding all this,
he is, or was, honorary secretary of toe Koyal
Colonial Institute. Like a lot of other fossils, he
is permitted to air himself in the Times as an
aut horlty on all matters colon lal. Mr. Y.. u ng is an
excellent specimen of the " representative Aus-
tralian.”
The question, “Shall B-rtrand be re-
leased ?” is bring extensively argued. The Bul-
letin, which has ever constantly opposed the m-
aioiioii of capital punishment, holds that Bertram
should not be released. It the N S.W. Ministry do
not find themselves bound to act otherwise, in
consequence of promises made by predecessors
In I'fflco, they should keep Bertrand in gaol
so as to show that, after all, there con be
B l? c r^ a thing as life-long punishment, and that
that barbarising institution, the gallows, need not
be retained on the plea that sooner or later the
most deliberate murderer is hound to be cast
loose upon society.
The medical man who looks after the
health of the Hobart people is a gentleman of a
somewhat vigorous turn of mind. A new arrival
by one of the home steamers relates that when
the ship reached Hobart the health officer came
alongside In a boat, and enquired after the health
of the passengers. “ All well,” replied the cap-
tain; wo had only one case of smallpox on board
and the patient is now fully recovered." “ If that's
the way with you,” roared the medical moo, “ get
up steam 'at once, and to with you out of
this.” “ And did the captain obey the order ? ”
“He did.” replied the new chum, sadly; "he
took us right on to New Zealand.”
Mr. David Blair, who never misses an
opportunity of giving bold advertisement to his
reputed book-learning, has been humbly praying
the Victorian Legislature to grant him free access
to the Parliamentary library ‘‘for the purpose of
prosecuting his literary studies and researches.”
This request is worthy of David’s reputation for
modesty. People are getting somewhat sceptical
about those literary studias and researches. There
is a prevailing idea that David is not what the
“pros.” call a “quick study.” No matter, let his
prayer be granted so long as he keeps his wisdom
strictly to himself. The fear is that he may let
some of it loose upon the world in the form of
another book.
The proposed colonial testimonial to the
Prince of Wales has “gone bung.” Despite the
fact that in each Australian capital the subscrip-
tion-list was headed by the local Governor, the
snobs, however much they would have liked to
be in the swim, dared not face the ridicule
attendant on the publication of their names in
connection with so monstrous a grovel. Well,
well I Has our boasted loyalty come to this at
last ? Wales cannot find an Australian soul to do
him two-guinea reverence, while a whole crowd of
people, who are too modest to allow their names
to appear in print, yearn to testimoniallse and
banquet a Sydney solicitor who has been sus-
pended by the Judges for overcharging his client!
Mr. William Green, a teetotal crank of
Highgate (Eng.), destroyed liquor, value £6OO, by
pouring it into a sewer. To dispose of Sydney
whisky in this way would be to confer an un-
merited slight on the sewage. By the way, ever
so many years ago, John Tawell, the Quaker mer-
chant (who built a Friends’ meeting-house in
Macquarie-street, Sydney), in a fit of virtue pub-
licly emptied many casks of grog into the beauti-
ful harbour. John (who had originally been
transported to N.S.W., but who while in the
colony had always seemed a perfect model of
piety) soon afterwards left for England, where he
poisoned a young mistress of his and was carefully
hanged. He was the first criminal caught in Eng-
land through the instrumentality of the electric
telegraph.
The proprietor of the—well, let us call it
the Alligator Creek (N S.W.) Chronicle has had
rather a rough experience of late. His editor,
compositor, accountant, and horse-power, all got
drunk, and ho was. therefore, compelled to dis-
charge this star variety combination, and send the
customary order to Sydney for “ a man with some
journalistic experience,” <fco. The aid horse-power
when leaving, however, asked for a testimonial,
and he got one that would have fitted a bush
angel. A few months more passed, and the new
Sala began also to get demoralised, and it became
necessary to get another new man to turn the
machine. The order for a literary hack was
therefore repeated, and to the disgust of the pro-
prietor he straightway got back his old bal bar-
gain, engaged on his own gushing certificate as to
sobriety.
Mr. Shepherd Smith, general manager of
the Bank of N.S.W., is still very ill. and his friends
are anxious regarding his final recovery.
“ Lord Carington will unveil the Kendall
monument.” We wonder whether they’ll manage
the general resurrection in N.S-W. without the
presence of Lord Carington ? ’* Under the special

the occasion.
The S.M. Herald's special correspondent,
writing from “en route to the Kimberley,” says
‘‘food la unobtainable, and the roads are bad.”
At the time of writing he had eaten his pack-
saddle, and was stewing his stirrup-irons for
mock-turtle soup. As he intends pushing on, he
will probably eat his mates in the interests of the
paper.
At Melbourne, some alleged “unem-
ployed ” waited on the Minister for Works, who
offered them stonebreaking to keep the wolf
from the door. They indignantly declined, where-
upon the Minister showed the sons of toil to the
door, and remarked, “Well, try hands are not
hard, but If my little wife wanted bread, I would
have It for her within an hour, blister or no
blisters.”
Violet Cameron, who played leading lady
in the latest English scandal, is engaged to appear
with her comic opera company, in New yorx, on
October 4. It seems that her tour had been ar-
ranged by the Earl of Lonsdale, and was—quoting
a London paper—“ merely a bond-fide business
speculation on his lordship's part ” Judging from
that Biddy cablegram we should say that Lonsdale
and Violet's notion of "bond-fide business” was
rather elastic. Anyway Miss Cameron’s American
tour will excite a good deal of interest. The story
of her Indiscretion has, doubtless, been powerfully
told in every Yankee paper. She will be received
with either a virtuous frost or a voluptuous wel-
come -probably toe latter. In that case the Karl
of Lonslale will participate la Violet’s triumnh,

Te Whiti, the Maori prophet, lately
“ Jugged ” for inciting bis followers to tresspass on
private property at Hawera, N.Z., has got his

Some years ago h« gave the then Governor and
the people of Maoriland a touch of brain colic by
his darn and inscrutable statement to the effect
that the “potato was cooked.” When in gaol In
Wellington, a week or two ago, he conceived and
brought forth a still more unfathomable mystery.
He sent, by the hand of a trusty unlettered fol-
lower, an empty egg-shell, addressed like a letter
to,one of the head ehibfs of Parlhaka. On the
receipt of this globular despatch at headquarters
we are told that great excitement and wonder
prevailed among the natives as to its meaning. A
pskeha, to waom it was shown, translated the
ovlcular message thus: “ The egg is blown.” This
probably refers to the condition of the N.Z.
finances.
Alf. Joseph, the well-known Sandhurst
bookmaker, has ahankering after civic" honours."
As Alf., the “ bookie,” he attends to the wants of
his townsmen with a little book and pencil—as
Mr, Joseph, the councillor, he throws his great
soul into the task of reducing rates. When not
knocking out a stiff ’unhe is enquiring into the
condition of Sandhurst roads. But we are wan-
dering from our point. The mayoralty has just
been offered to Mr. Joseph, on condition that he
pledged himself to retire from bookmaking. This
placed him in a position of extreme delicacy. The
flattered councillor reflected that it was wondrous
nice to be a mayor and wear a chain of office
round his substantial shoulders. He also reflected
that it was exceedingly pleasant to “ skin the
lamb,” and scoop in the " quids” of the Gentiles.
Further, he reflected that mayoralty only lasts a
year or so, while bookmaking endures for the
term of one’s natural life. Taking one thing with
another, Mr. Joseph stated that he had intended
to renounce his volume, but at the same time, he
thought it would be “ humiliating ” to give any
pledge. Then the Council elected somebody else.
Most people will agrje with Alf. It would indeed
be humiliating—to become a mayor. Fancy a
man who has spent the best years of his life in
shouting “ the field a hundred I ” sinking so low as
to read an address of welcome to a Governor I
Worse still—he might have had to entertain
“ Wales ” at luncheon.
The Age furnishes an artless explanation
of the fact that three English clerics have declined
the Bishopric of Melbourne. “ What is obvious,”
says the Age, “is that a man of self sacrificing
enthusiasm would commonly not be attracted by
labour among a decorous and wealthy community.”
According to the journal of advanced liberal
principles, this Bishopric which is going begging
Is such an easy billet
That none wants to fill it.
Our respect for lawn-sleeves and gaiters has In-
creased ten-fold since reading this. Surely it is
only in the hoard’s vineyard that such labourers
are to be found—men who shrink from under-
taking duties which are too light. Who but a
Bishop would protest against'receiving too many
half-pence and not enough kicks ? But there is an
“ obvious ” remedy for this difficulty. That the
community must remain decorous and wealthy is,
alas! unavoidable, but things might be equalised,
as far as the Holy Church is concerned, by making
the billet of Bishop a purely honorary one. The
oath through the Melbourne See is not very
thorny or briery. Yet if some self-sacrificing
enthusiast likes to come over and travel it for his
bare tucker he will be doing his Master’s work in
his Master’s way. If it hurts a Bishop s feelings
to offer him a “ soft thing ” why not alter the con-
ditions? For our part, we would like to see
Bishop Moorhouse’s successor working for notmng
and paying a royalty on all the brands he snateoea
from the burning. A Bishop (or hia
generally has a private fortune.
The popular Victorian idol of the Hour is
E. Valentine Browne. Like Benjamin Disraeli, he
hai triumphed against ridicule, and lived to put
his proud foot upon the men who once reviiea
him. Some 13 months ago Valentine was a ciera
in the General Post Office, at Melbourne. Bis
genius must have been unappreciated at tnai iwa,
for the question was asked in the House whetn
Mr. Browne sat on a stool all the week, daing
nothing but draw his salary.” As a h aa ‘‘‘f r + u B

who leads the Highland crofters, has published a
fleroely-worded manifesto threatening local land-
lordism, ana concluding thus:—” Unless reasonab.e
justice be done to the Highlanders, we shall
agitate not only for a Crofter Bill but lor Scottish
Home Rule. Men who are driven desperate by
oppression are driven to desperate remedies. If
we cannot get an inch let us demand a yard. It is
far more important that the oppressed go free
than that any modern Pnaraoh boast of Imperial
solidarity.”
If Abbott will declare himself and
lead the N.S.W. Protectionist party, that party
will sweep the country at a general election, for
Abbott is a strong man, and has so far played his
cards excellently. Squatt rs and selectors alike
know that he would give them fair play, and as he
is not a bigot he could be objected to on religious
grounds by no one, save the Orangemen, more than
naif of whom—listen, Parkes-are aggressive Pro-
tectionists. But even should Abbott remain on the
tenoe, the Protectionist cause will prosper. Mr.
F. Heydon’s review of the progress of Protec-
tion in N.S.W. has Induced reflection on the part
thousands who never previously thought
about the matter la their lives

Shade of the Commercial Bank of South Australia,
just think of that I The S.A. Parliament Is a con-
gress of dry rot and Dry Creek gaol saints. The
members are grumbling because the Speaker does
not pray daily, and yet an alllgator-hlde female
says she cannot sit there without losing her
character. When the female parliament is estab
llshed morals will surely go up. The ladies, of
course, will have the Upper House, and rank as
Peeresses, and we presume they will legislate in
lull dress’—a menagerie of skin and bone, the
prospect of viewing which ought certainly to
tempt Wales out here to open the Jubilee Ex-
hibition, if nothing else will. Then when he visits
the council they can put the plump peeresses in
front, and the old, gaunt, blue-nosed, and angular
ones behind, and make the naked museum look as
gay as possible. The idea is worth considering.
Jar Northern Australia, as yet unoor-
rupted by the meretricious influence of glittering
governors and scented C.M G.-dom, has got a Arm
grip of the eternal truths which the busy agents
°f Imperialism and their obedient flunkies ate
striving to hide from the gaze of the people of the
pore “civilised ” but less virile South. Just listen
to the Carpentaria Times:— “The time has not yet
arrived for Australia to ssk for independence, but
?o ope with common sense can close his eyes to
the fact jthat these colonies must, before many
years have passed, become a great federated re-
public, untrammelled by the politics of the old
world, unmoved by the petty jealousies of the
different European nations, and indifferent to
their wars. Glorying in our own unity and
brotherhood; stroagln every sense of freedom;
happy in the knowledge that we have a grand
future before us, we can go on steadily,
unswervingly, prepared for the great event
which must come sooner or later. All Aus-
tralians should keep this thought always
before them, * Independence is our right, and this
we must have.’ The grown-up sons of this beau-
tiful continent should ever strive to impress upon
their younger brethren, the rising generation, tbe
fact that Australia owes nothing to England. Why
should four millions of enlightened people, in-
habiting a country 10,000 miles from Europe, and
out of the range of its dynastic influences, t e
alarmed at a war between England and Russia or
England and Prance I If England chooses to go to
war with either of these powers why should the
commercial, peace-loving Australians be drawn
into the quarrel ? Are our harbours to be block-
aded, our cities bombarded, and our commerce
ruined for love of England—the country which has
thrown us over several times to oblige Germany
and Prance 'i Let Australians be prepared to de-
clare their independence, for assuredly we can
only gain by severing the slender cord which
binds us to that distant land. At present
we pay for the maintenance of a volunteer
force; truly not a large sum, hut should
war be declared between England and Russia
our expenditure during the time of war would
be enormous. Canada, a British possession, keeps
up an active force of 40,000 men, besides a reserve
of 600.000, The United States Republic, with 10
times the number of inhabitants, maintains an
army of only 35,090, and these are mainly employed
In keeping down the wild Indian tribes. Our posi-
tion is just tbe same as that of Canada, for as long
as we are attached to Britannia's apron strings w@
shall have to keep up a military force. The money
voted for defence purposes would be far better
employed in improving the condition of the
fieople by education or other means, and by carry-
ag out important public works, to do which at
present we are continually borrowing money. We
pay our Governors a large annual salary, the sum
total being nearly £50,000. What do we get in re-
turn for it ? Some of tne old colonists, especially
those who have returned to England, are con-
tinually howling for Imperial 'Federation, and
an Imperial Parliament in London. No Aus-
tralian could dream ,of such a thing. An
Imperial Parliament would mean a House
in which colonial members would have as
much chance of obtaining their rights as the Par-
□ellltes have at the present time. Besides, Imperial
Federation would not take away the dangers of
being drawn into a European war. Let us, there-
fore, throw away this Idea and strive, first, to
bring about Australian Federation, and then in-
dependence. All members of cricket and football
clubs, and of young men’s associations throughout
the land, should range themselves under the starry
banner of Australia. There will be no need for us
to fight for independence like tbe Americans.
When England’s Ministers know that we want
separation, they will assuredly give it. Let Aus-
tralia strike out for herself aad show to the world
a flourishing&nd po werful|Republio, together with
a peace-loving and industrious people, who, have
no interests in the old world, and who are
powerful in their prosperity without requiring
the aid of a large military torce to prop up that
power.” Are your lordships listening ?
Sweets to the Sweet. Farewell!
The testimonial-mongering mania ia fast becoming
a disease, against which it behoves every true man
to apply such remedial agencies as he can. Booted
in the strong soil of self-interest, and top-dressed
with personal vanity, it defies alike the withering
heat of invective and the cutting winds of sarcasm.
The thorough testimonial-monger is as impervious
to the scoffiog laugh of satire as to the silence of
contempt. Long association with mean men and
calculation of mean motives has thickened his
hide to a rhlnocerine density, from which the
shafts of censure and of ridicule glance off un-
heeded. That there should be aught unmanly,
fulsome, or degrading in this habitual beslavering
of ordinary, mostly negative, merit with extra-
ordinary laudation, he is unable to comprehend.
We all know how conventionality deadens the
moral sense, even to the significance of those
awful truths which deal with the mystery of mail’s
being, temporal responsibility, and final destiny;
nor can it be deemed strange if the constant con-
templation of a despicable species of tribute
through conventional lenses ends at last by making
it seem respectable and even praiseworthy. Granted
that occasions may arise on which the collective
voice of society clamours for an outlet to Its ad-
miration of some transcendent merit, ia it wise, or
even honest, to vulgarise what should be a
rare exception into a routine compliment to
every decent mediocrity? There are colonial
towns in which the abuse has reached
such a pass, that every resident of a few years’ or
even months’ standing, whose local career has been
free from gross scandal, and who may be induced
by interest, neoess ty, or inclination to pull up his
tent-pegs and migrate else whither, considers
himself to have a prescriptive claim on this form
of public adulation. He may be the very type of
commonplace, may be shallow, vulgar, stupid,
mean, vain; let him but manage to maintain an
outward show of respectability, keep his fingers
out of his neighbour s till, and his own person out
of gaol for all offences save drunkenness, go to
church now and then, and contribute the quota of
his insignificance to the local institute or hospital
committee—and these shining services shall have
their reward in the inevitable purse of sovereigns
or service of plate.
♦ * •
It is curious to note how, on the approaching
departure of one to ha testlmonialiaed, old enmi-
ties soften, acrid Jealousies cool down, grudges of
long standing are forgotten in the delightful ex-
citement of planning an envoi that shall be re-
corded in the papers, together with the names of
all who contributed by purse or presence to the
success of the “ pleasing ceremony.” The latter
point is one of special importance, for the well-
known definition of gratitude as “ a lively sense of
favours to come ” is in a peculiar sense true of
the testimonial-mongerlng fraternity, and the
organiser of to-day’s testimonial may be the reci-
pient of to-morrow’s. Hence the necessity for
keeping the names of all likely parties well
before one another and the general public, from
whose ranks the close guild who make it their
life business to arrange and receive pre-
sentations,- are from time to time recruited.
The primary responsibility for the establishment
of this fretting sore, which is eating more widely
and deeply Into society every year, rests in no
small degree with the “ religious ” world, and in a
minor degree with their guides and idols, the
clergy. In the absence of any State-supported
church, the normal atmosphere breathed by minis-
ters of religion in Australia is one of genteel men-
dicancy, From year’s end to year’s end their wits
are, as a rule, quite as much exercised in raising
the wind as their faith is in sowing and tending
the good seed in the stony soil of money-grubbing
hearts. This incessant wide-awakeness to the
main chance necessarily breeds a callous indiffer-
ence to certain worldly scruples that worry the
mere layman. A kind of manly instinct—for it
can hardly be said to reaeh the dignity of a prln-
ciple-is constantly prompting the latter to assert,
as far as he is able, his independence of outward
help, to accept no gift without rendering some
equivalent, and to feel himself humiliated, in
some sort, by an obligation that he cannot re-
quite. Nor is this feeling confined to men of
strict probity. It Is found, sometimes in an
abnormal degree, among those who live by
fleecing society generally, to whom post-nuptial
settlements and compositions of half-a-crown in
the pound are familiar expedients, and in whose
moral phsrmaey a certificate of discharge counts
as a sovereign salve for a cracked reputation.
They see no inconsistency in this. To them the
business of money-making is an encounter of wits,
in which the victor claims the spoils as a tribute
to his superior keenness. The common herd, in
short, even in their mo?t rapacious mood,
view the receipt of alms as derogatory to
their manhood. No such unreasonable prejudice
is found in the priestly caste. Whether the habit
of self-sffacement and continuous brooding over
the hopeless state of mankind in general is un»
favourable to perfect manliness, as evidenced in
the co-existence of certain feminine attributes
which have caused the unregenerate to class
priests and parsons as the “ epicene gender,” or
whether the traditional practice of begging for
“charitable objects’’-always remembering that
“ charity begins at home’’—engenders what may
be termed the “ mendiemt diathesis” in the eccle-
siastical character, certain it is that very few of
that order disdain even the smallest contribu-
tions, whether in money or in kind, from anybody
whose liberality takes that particular form.
♦ ♦ »
It has, through long usage, become generally
understood that in the matter of giving and re-
ceiving at least, the unwritten code to which lay
society conforms, has no application to minis-
ters of religion. They will be regarded
as above or beneath it, accordingly as people’s
estimate of “ the cloth ” is high or low,
but in this both the elect and the scoffers are
agreed, that long conformity to current usage
virtually disfranchises the clergy from the privi-
lege claimed by every self-respecting man, that of
resenting the sort of compulsory patronage that
is implied in unasked favours. If this be doubted,
let the “rector” of a country parish dare to
politely decline the tide of (probably unmarket-
able) bacon, that is sent round with Mrs. Church-
warden Hodge’s ‘ beat respeeks:” and see what
will thence ensue. Or let the spiritual ruler of a
fashionable city congregation, who pride them-
selves on appearances, but venture on the faintest
protest against the movement that has been set on
foot for presenting him with the orthodox buggy
and pair that are destined to eat him cut of
house and home, and then, hazard a guefs how
long he will retain the esteem of bis flock. It
must be this habit of clerical submission to the
unreasoning Impulse that prompts men to do
something that shall make them “feel good,”
whether the deed be really beneficial or otherwise;
this willingness on the part of clergymen to offer
themselves up as villa corpora on the dissecting
table of experimental munificence, that must, we
think.be regarded as the princary source of the
testimonial plague. There is good circumstantial
authority for concluding that among the colonial
clergy of every denomination the professional re-
pute, If not the actual gain accruing from fare-
well presentations, is as confidently reckoned on
as if it had been the subject of previous stipula-
tion. And when the salt of the earth are thus
yielding, and permit their flocks to turn what, if
defensible at all, ought to be a strict business
transaction, and conducted in corresponding
privacy, Into an occasion for offensive self-glorifi-
cation and mutual baek-scratohing, can we wonder
if the small fry of bank clerks, civil servants,
third-rate politicians, club and lodge secretaries,
and the like, follow suit ? Where the path has
been so clearly marked by holy men and their ad-
mirers, who shall blame the unregenerate olt, to
whom notoriety is as the breath of life, if he en-
deavour to copy so illustrious an example 7

Cure. Fi r nearly five years I suffered excru-

greater part of that time I scarcely knew what it
was to have a good night’s rest, and on several
occasions while performing in California, had to
obtain the services of others to take my place. I
consulted the beet doctors in San Francisco and
Sydney without avail, until a friend advised me
to try Warner’s Safe Cure. After taking the
second bottle, a complete change took place, and
lam now quite well. You may make use of this

spine, attended.with headaches, and my legs and
ancles were much swollen and broken out In many
places; my eyes were also much inflamed. I was

“Stony Creek, Lane Cove, Sydney, NS.W„
18tn March, 1886.—“ I nave been a sufferer for the
last eighteen years, and have seen many doctors
without their being able to agree as to my com-
plaint. One said 1 had had sunstroke, and treated
me accordingly. I was then advised to go to the
Sydney Infirmary, but after a few weeks’ trial
left, feeling very little better. I suffered from
pains in the back and spine, with dreadful head-
aches and palpitation of the heart. My urine was
not natural, being muddy. I have not been able
to work, and Indeed scarcely able to stand, for tne
past seven years. I was Induced to try Wabnbr's
Safe Cure and Safe Pills, and have taken three
dozen bottles. I do not grudge It, as 1 am satisfied.
No one need suffer who will persevere with
Warner s Safe Remedies. After taking three
bottles, my palpitation disappeared, and has not
returned.

About 8 o’clock on Saturday evening a
graceful figure, surmounted by a refined am In-
tellectual countenance, might have been seen
plunging through the eager multitude at the
circle entrance of Sydney Royal Standard. The
figure was ud, the multitude was the other man.
One or two more came in later, but still the dreaj-
clrcle did not present a very animated appear-
ance. “ The Lyons Courier,” however, seemed
highly aceeptable to the crowd beneath. The
whole sensation consists of a murder—the most
stupid murder ever yet committed, but the crime
is delicately shaded off with beer, and the lighter
touches are filled In by a portly Infuriated demon,
in the preliminary stage of snakes, smashing two
chairs and a table, and kicking a packing-case Into
matchwood. The needful mystery Is brought
about through the resemblance between the
demon with the snakes and a saint of considerable
corpulency, and It Is not till the last act that the
saint gets uppermost. For our own part we
have grown so tired of poetic justice that
we would much rather have had the good
man hanged. Of course the stout fiend
might have been killed off afterwards, but even
here a little novelty would have been agreeable.
We would have liked, for instance, to see that
beer-soaked criminal standing on the balcony
watching his victim's execution, and then, while
a grin of demoniac glee overspread his counte-
nance, a two-yard kangaroo might have come In,
and crossing the room at the full hop. have dis-
embowelled him so suddenly, that he would have
kept on smiling even after having got the “ Happy
Despatch.”
♦ * *
The story commences with a red-headed
horsey man, and a rusty black froggy individual
with thin legs, watting for someone to come and
explain everything. A depraved dude Joins
them, and Is followed by a useles* old fogey, who
seems to have been butted into the drama, so that
another man may tell him that he wishes he could
lend him a horse. A happy man comes next, with
his daughter and future son-in-law, and the old
fogey explains distinctly that he has sold his horse.
Then a drunken ruffian rolls in, and a woman
goes down on her knee-pan and calls for ven-
geance on her betrayer, who calmly swallows glass
after glass of brandy, and uses the thin man
as a slop-basin. The woman says a time
will come; the ruffian says he don’t care if It
does, ana we pass on to a scene where a white-
headed individual Is keeping a pub. His son
comes along on a borrowed horse, leaves some
money on the table, and then makes an effort to
walk round the corner In the shortest time on
record. Next a party of assassins appear, and
after liquoring up they murder a courier and
embezzle 75,000 franca. The gaffer of the gang after-
wards proceeds to search the pocket* of the not-
lost-but-gone-before, and while so doing the white
headed man comes In and Is *hot. He falls yelling
‘‘My son,” which Is, of courie, a mistake In
Identity, and the murderer responds with a wild
hyena laugh, and finds tuppence on the corpse.
At this point the moon goes mad and throws a blue
light on the scene which makes the landscape
resemble rotten cheese, while the bad man under
the same Influence appears to be overgrown w.th
furgus.
* • *
The third.hot is filled with cursing, but the
old man wjfh the pub. curses the loudest. Three
criminals sQb arrested, and the saint with the bulgy
stomach is also run in by mistake. Then there is
more bad language, and the party of four are
scruffed off to gaol by a French policeman with red
legs, and the atmosphere Is filled with wailing.
The ruffian goes on an atrocious drunk, and the
woman who said the time would come resolves to
save the Innocent victim. There is a burglary
committed about this time, and somebody stabs
somebody else, but at length we meet the dude
and the horsey man going to the scaffold, and
showing a remorseful tendency to flop at the last
moment. Their leader hires a room to watch the
execution, and perpetrates a terrific shlvoo amid
the furniture, throwing a table at the head of his
accomplice and playfully knocking down that in-
dividual and sitting on him. Then suddenly the
heavens and the earth are rent asunder; the room
is filled with policemen and agony; twenty people
yell at once; the criminal kicks two men In the
wind simultaneously and knocks down two more,
but Is squashed at last, and the portly saint smiles
In the doorway while the sinner is out off like the
grass which perisheth.
Death shied a cold potato at him,
And he slept,
• * •
Mr. Dampier makes a good figure in the
double part of Dubose, the villain, and Lesurques,
the well-developed saint, but his work Is very
heavy, especially In the last act. He stands on the
balcony In his capacity as a drunken flend and
watches himself in his other capacity mounting
the scaffold, and then he howls and shakes his fist
at himself, and wants to see himself guillotined.
But a movement In the crowd—a general rush,
and a burst of execration, tell him that he is to be
released and himself arrested instead. He attempts
to escape, but Is overpowered, and then he comes
In smiling, and standing in the doorway looks
scornfully at himself pinned down on the floor,
and thanks Heaven for hi* escape, while he kicks
and yells in his frantic endeavours to get free and
fly at his own throat. We have only once seen
Mr. Dampler’s effort outdone, and that was by a
gentleman who filled three parts at once, and after
fighting with himself all over the stage, he rushed
In and separated himself, and finally kicked him-
self out. Mr. Holloway, as a white-headed man
who sells grog, Is very good; so is Mr. Pompey
—we mean Mr. Cfeiar—who plays the magistrate,
while Fouinard the philosopher shows consider-
able talent in his legs. In conclusion, we can only
urge Mr. Dampier once more to have Dubose
killed by a kangaroo. We want to see some novelty
tor once, and “ The Lyons Courier,” though well
Played, is merely a murdered hash, or rather a
hash of murder, and, like many others, we are
growing weary of stage slaughter.

“ The Great Divorce Bill ” at Sydney
(J P e , ra House Is another essay on the well-worn
subject of mothers In law, and seems to have
been written for the purpose of showing what
may come to when she gets to be
middle-aged and strong-minded, and Jives, too,
exclusively on a diet of vinegar. O’Gorman s
parent-ln-law is obtrusive all through the piece,
and she is “that aggrawatln’ she would disturb
the d*ath-bed of a hoyster,” while Pllkie’s rela-
STf’tnoughnot actually visible, casts a shadow
like that of a vicious cow-eleohant over the scene.
Moreover, the wife’s mother la absolutely übiqui-
tous. bhe has a countenance like a post-office
carving, and when she has made up h»r mind to
be particularly disagreeable she shuts her mouth
with a snap as if she held a Hebrew mortgage

e kicks of this life, and decide to dine out. On
the same day O’Gorman gets his first client, being
employed by the jealous Lady Hamerton to get un
a divorce case against her husband who flirts with
Mrs. Graham In a reprehensible manner, and under
the Inspiriting influences of dissipation and pros-
perity the pair of friends get into a joyous condi-
tion and follow two ladies home to their hotel.
Here the unconscious lawyer flirts with Mr
Graham herself, while his own detective, em
ployed to watch that lady and Sir Francis Hame
ton, shadows him, and industriously gets up a oas
against his employer. Sir Francis also arrive
end the decpalrlnsr O’Gorman psssei himself off ai
a doctor, and prescribes a aeton and a tourniquei
to be taken infernally twlae a day, while Pilkle, 1
the character of a homoeopathic praotitlone
dodders about in a profuse perspiration, and pin
his shifting faith to 1 globule*.” But more visitor
arrive, and the lawyer, already heartily weary o
his enjoyment, has to retreat into Mrs. Graham
dressing-room, where above the buaz of converse
tlon can be heard a fearful din as he engages 1
single combat with that lady’s lap-dog. Provl
denoe, which watches over the sick, lame, anc
lazy, brings him off victorious, and he nex
appears as a good subject for Pasteur
arrayed in the ghastly mockery of what was one
a dress coat, and carrying a stiffened carcase, on
which he returns a verdict of ‘‘Justifiable dogi
2, °* bis crowning misfortune falls upon
him. He has taken off his rent garment, and laid
it reverently on a sofa, when his peppery house
keeper, who has been shadowing him all the even
ing, embezzles the derelict swallow-tail, and
carries it off to his mother-in-law.
• • v
Amid these accumulated sorrows, O’Gor
man gives up his case. He dare not face his own
detective, who has got up a mass of evidence
against him; neither can he encounter Sir Francis
who wishes to know the effect of a tourniquet
taken in a glass of water twice a day; and he
spends the morning in telling his friends of the
preceding night that he is ill with bronchitis o
the brain, or some such ailment, and is present in
his medical capacity, to attend on himself. Fit!

between Lady Hamerton and her husband, stand
ing uneasily on oae leg the while, and gets
friend, with unsteady joints, to marry his mother
in-law, after which he embraces his wife and the
slavey in an ecstasy of joy, and the curtain falls
amid a roar of laughter.
• • a
The piece depends entirely for its success
on Mr. St. Maur, who takes the part of O’Gorman
and that gentleman's ability as a comedian woulc
make even a corpse interesting. If a piece ooulc
be written in which he would appear as a deac
body and lie in the middle of the stage througt
three acts, we are inclined to fancy he woulc
create some genuine amusement o ut of the grad ua
process of stiffening. Mr. Alfred Maltby appear!
tor the first time in Australia in the character ol
Weathersley Grandison, and makes a success oui
of that limp, knock-kneed, sleepy-headed indl-
whlle Miss Brooke, as the lawyer’s wife,
and Miss Annie Taylor, as that Frankenstein mon-
ster, O Gorman’s progenltor-inrlaw, are both ex-
ceedingly good. Pilkle, whose, name very appro-
priately rhymes with “ Milky,” is played by Mr.
Redwood, who fills the bill well, and looks like a
South Australian bank apostle. The comedy in
the present hands is Intensely amusing, though if
badly played It would degenerate into a blank and
aimless farce.
*» * *
Id other circumstances Leitch’s version of
His Natural Life” would have enjoyed a con-
siderable run at the Theatre Royal, Sydney, A
number of persons suddenly awoke to the fact
that Marcus Clarke’s novel abounds in interest.
Consequently, both author and work were all at
or * ce shot Into the face of the public with deter-
mined persistency. To listen to the clamour at
theatre doors and to read the harangues In news-
papers a stranger would suppose that Marcus died
just a few weeks ago, and that the city population
was in the first agony of bereavement, clothed in
the gloom of newly-bought sables and crape. It
would startle him to hear that the man everybody
was talking about had wasted and worn out hla
life many years ago; rejected, defected, an intel-
lectual Ishmael, but weak-armed and weak-willed,
because Foverty, the long-beaked vulture of
civilisation, sat daily pecking at him. The stranger
would likely call it characteristic that the rssur-
reotlon of the man at the present time has been
wholly due to the enterprise of a couple of show-
men.
* * *
Mr. George Darrell will succeed Marcus
Clarke. This also is characteristic. New South
Wales is unmistakably in the show age. To the
present public the faculty which perceives the
Incongruous is wanting. That lack is discovered
in the career of all peoples. The mind springs
into huge growth in some directions, leaving
others undeveloped. The result is that unrelated
things are placed together without any sense of
difference or contrast. By the way, down in Mel-
bourne, at the present time, Joe Brown is running
Bmelie Melville in opera-bouffe, and simultane-
ously a panorama of the N.Z. volcanic eruptions.
That shows a son of the time. But unconscious-
ness of the difference between the real and the
seeming-real, the good and the seeming-good, the
fact and the show-fact, the thing and the display-
thlng, leads by a steep and slippery gradient to
national lunacy.

Mr. Darrell’s play has for its hero an Irish
priest. Next to a stick of dynamite, an Irish priest

This soggarth, too, will hear confessions.
Diou Bouoioault used to keep his soggarths drink-

be playing into the hands of Edith O Gorman to
Set a sacredness on the auricular business. She is
sure to come out with a play in reply. But, after
uh ®il9 uld „ n °t one actor give an Inspirational
lift to another ? Nearly a year ago we enquired
whether It was Darrell or Dailey who originated
the idea of a belligerent expedition. Strickland
we threw overboard. But Darrell told us that five
years ago he had written a drama lu which the
sending away of an Australian contingent in a
dark hour of England’s need is a prominent fea-
ture. This throws light on the recently-announced
approehe between Dailey and Darrell. The dreamer
of dramatic dreams and the hero of the glittering
goat-killing falchion meet. The Idealist and the
realist embrace. How long is George Darrell to
be left untitled ?

We made our best salaam before the
Or rand Duchess ” at the New Masonic Hall,
sycney, toe other evening, and nearly broke off
short at the waist in the effort to do proper
homage to that charming lady. As a rule, we do
nst affect” duchesses, and the majority
wo save seen have excited only the same degree
of reverence that we generally pay to a olothes-
snrsa, but Miss Florence Seymour presented so
marked a contrast to the majority of over-fed
German aristocrats that we made this exception
In her favour. Her Highness of Gerolstein, too,
is aa orphan, and we remember with sympathy
that she has grown up without the fostermg care

General Boom, played by Mr. Farley, was
PJ fa £i best of the male characters, and the
huge C.M.G. medal which he wore on top of the
place where he had put the cold fowl at dinner-
time t excited general admiration. His singing
and anting were both admirable, and he Infused a
vast amount of original stupidity into the part,
which, added to Boom’s original ox-beadedness,
made the buifcy veteran intensely amusing. His
army, about 14 strong, wore bulbous pants to
pover their martial ardour, and looked strikingly
like the famed Soudan Contingent. Mr. Harry
Power acted as Baron Puck, and owed a good deal
te the excellent orchestra, though the latter cer-
tainly owed him nothing. We lost his best song,
thanks to an agricultural clod who sat near us,
and who kept making remarks about a badly-
greased cart-wheel, which seemed to prey on his
mind very much. He also talked about a frog
croaking In & swamp, and about a particularly
hoarse terrier which he keeps In his vegetable
garden to frighten away cats, a combination of
domestic details which, he seemed to think, had
some connection with the Baron’s operatic per-
formance. Mr. Walshe, as Fritz, sang In excellent
style and acted much oetterjthan usual; while Mis*
St. John, In the part of Prince Paul, was almost
perfect, and looked the character admirably.
Baron Grog's make-up was one of the features of
fke performance, his baronial countenance looking
iike the label of a whisky bottle; and Miss Lovell,
as Wanda, deserved a better part.
♦ ♦ *
The gentleman who throws ill-directed
bouquets was again to the fore. On this occasion
“® hibernated somewhere on the front seats,
and then waking up a moment too late, wildly dis-
charged his lioral trophy at the scene which was
already down. Apparently, however, he was not
qualified even to hit a mountain with a brick,
for, with the whole scene for a target, he only
succeeded In lauding on the muzzle of one of the
wind instruments In the orchestra, and drove
kbout 12 inches of music down the performer’s
throat. The Chinese must go, and this man must
go with them, for he threatens to become a public
nuisance. Lastly, the two supers who dodge
across the stage, perpetrated an outrage on
anatomy, for they wore their chests behind, and
were perfectly flat down the front. We would
like to dissect these men.

The Federal Minstrels, at Sydney Academy,
are drawing good houses with another new pro-
gramme, the principle novelty being “ Phaluo
Capltas,” a series of shadow-pictures of well-
known characters, from Battenberg’s female boss-
in-law down to Hublgle, of the N.B.W. Haas-embly,
and the Jawbone of Paddington. Most of them
are exceedingly good likenesses, and several look
considerably more intelligent than they do In the
flesh, though Victoria, by the grace, &c., was
rather disappointing, the grace bolog too thin to
oast a reflection. “The Rivals” was better than
ever, and Raynor Brothers have introduced a
number of novelties, among them a duet between
a pair of bellows and a tin whistle which is a great
favourite with the audience. But we must really

The performance was good enough but the very
name is too much for us, for we loath the whole
tribe of Israel-beaked songsters. We a’so have a
parrot, a saintly bird, Imported from Adelaide,
which wails solemnly every five minutis, “Let
us swindle and pray,“and we can’t get rid of him.
We once hired a game cat at 30j. a week to put a
head on the bird, but after 49 rounds, the lelino
was reduced to oat rags, and the cheerless fowl re-
sumed Its perch, and snuffled out the first re-
corded variation on Its usual doxology, saying
calmly, “Let us cuss.” Beaumont Read as the
lawyer, and Alf. Moynham as the launder or
washerwoman, or whatever he should be termed,
were very amusing, and the other performers
were good throughout. There was also a new
Joke; we have forgotten tho point of it. but we-
ar© quite certain It had a point of some kind.

Various Yankee papers profess to believe
that “Wales” will accompany Mrs. Langtry on

good business for the Lily, but we don’t think it

be expected to take a hand In the show, but’he
might just hang around enough to raise a suffi-
ciency of good advertising scandals, which Mrs.
Langtry knows how to work for all they are
worth.

The revelations made by Mr. Creed,
M.L.0., in the N.S.W. Council, regarding the
storage of war material at Bsrry’s Bay, are hardly
of a kind to reassure the public at a time like the
present when half-a-dozen European potentates
seem ready at any moment to create a destructive
war, A struggle in which Britain requires to take
part would certainly Involve these colonies in
strife, and being dragged into a quarrel from
which we could reap no profit, we would
also require, la all probability, to trust at
the outset to our own resources. And a
great portion of these resources, it appears*
are stored in an old, stone-bullt, shingle-
roofed building at Berry’s Bay, protected only
by an open gate, and the customary handbill
on its front-doer stating that no one Is admitted
except on business. Per the sake of consistency
this notice should certainly be headed “ To Rus-
sians and ether Foreign Enemies,’’ though It
is to be feared that an enemy on mlsohief
bent would hardly stay to read the intimation.
Mr. Creed says that he walked into the build-
ing without question or hindrance, and
found the live defenders to consist chiefly
of an obliging labourer, from whom he
gathered sufficient information to qualify him
to blow the colony's military stores to atoms, and
perhaps to wreck half Sydney as well. Inside
were open torpedoes and open cases; four tons of
gun-cotton was also in store, and the actual safe-
guards were nil. There were also 400 or 500 detona-
tors on the premises, which may one day assist to
send the whole betiding and Its contents to king-
dom come even without outside aid. The roof, too,
is rotten and inflammable, the doors are feeble,
the fence is a sham, and the solitary guardian of
the place—when he is at home—lives some
50yds. away. Moreover, these ill-defended stores
are said to be deteriorating through sheer
carelessness, and may prove useless in time
of need. The' gun-cotton requires damping;
the armoured torpedo cable la not kept in water
so as to preserve it; and even at the best the war-
machines will probably break down on an emer-
gency for want of sufficient trained men to work
them. Duringthelast warsoare more than six weeks
were required before one line of defence was laid
down across a single channel In Port Jackson, and
at the same rate of progress months would pass
before the capital would be safe. Ultimately
Newcastle, Botany, and the Eastern Channel at
Sydney were left undefended, so that the fortifi-
cations were the weakest of shams after all. These
are a few of the points of Dr. Creed’s Indictment,
and they are quite sufficient to show that some-
thing more than skeleton reviews and mock fights
are wanted to Insure the public safety.

Australia t —
I A new Zealand paper is giring way to
considerable excitement because a cow backed a
farmer up Into the corner of a stable, and then
seized bis hand In Its teeth and ate it, and the
journalist describes the affair as “ a most singular
accident.” For our own part, seeing the cow
committed the outrage deliberately, we fall to per-
ceive where the accident comes in, and we are even
doubtful about the singularity of the occurrence.
If the man had backed the cow up into a corner
and then eaten the stable, the affair would have
presented some surprising features. The same
might have been said if the cow had backed the
man up and then eaten itself, or if the stable had
run them both into a corner and then devoured
the cow, or if the cow had driven the stable Into
an angle of the man and then chewed up both
Houses of Parliament. Or supposing the cow had
eaten the stable, and peacefu.ly munched the
rafters, and the galvanlzed-iron roof, it might
have justified a little temporary alarm; or, agaln t
the animal might have eaten the man with its hind
leg instead of i‘s teeth, which would have been
also a departure from the customary routine; or,
further, the man might have eaten himself, and
the cow done likewise, and then both might have
gone out and eaten the horse. As the matter
stands, however, it Is the very weakest kind of
sensation, and If the New Zealanders can do no
better than this, they would do well to give up
cows and Journalism altogether.
berg of the Assembly were a bad lot, and then,
with tears and perspiration running down his
childlike face, he said that “ he felt at times like a
fish out of water amongst them, and would not
have been there unless he realised it was the will
of the Lord. He urged them to elect Christian and
not Godless men If they wanted good and pure
laws, and entreated them to pray more earnestly
for members of Parliament.” Hobbs, it will be
seen, did not associate with the wretched sinners
in the House of Baal, because he lusted after
the wages of sin—which, by-the-bye, in N.Z. are
not death, but £310 per session-but because
it was “ the will of the Board.” Yet the Assembly
went on Its perverted way and recked not of its
Hosannah Hobbs, and, in the beautiful words of
Shakespeare, “ he felt like a fish out of water.”
Whether Providence would have yelled at Hobbs
and told him to go into Parliament if there had
been no salary is doubtful, and it Is also question-
able whether Hobbs would not have put cotton in
his ears and become deaf had he been asked to roll
up as an honorary Hobbs. But he is there 11 by the
will of the Board," and the only pity is, that he is
not at Adelaide Instead.

The Queen’s taste in literature is pretty
well understood by this time. She degraded Ten-
nyson to the peerage, not because he was a poet,
but because be beslavered the German mediocrity
whom she conducted to the altar. She knighted
the editor of the Morning Post In recognition of
his gorgeous talents as a descriptive reporter of
her daily walks and drives. Now Her Majesty has
discovered a most bea-u-tlful poem, “ She noddit
to me,” in the columns of an obscure Scotch jour-
nal. Her enthusiasm is easily accounted for. The
“ gem ” under notice is a four-verse ballad detail-
ing the drivelllngs of some other old lady to
whom the Queen is supposed to have noddel.
Here’s a chip off the gem
“ But I’ve aye been unlucky,
And the blinds were aye doon,
Till last week the time
O’ her veesit cam’ roon’.
I waved my bit apron
As brisk’s I could dee.
An’ the Queen lauohed fu’ kindly,
An’ noddit to mel”
When Victoria read that poem, she felt happier
than she had ever felt since poor Brown died. The
pathos lurking in the “ noddit ” (last line of each
verse) went right to the royal heart. By request
of Her Majesty the name of the immortal bard was
promptly communicated to her, and she sent him
something handsome. Her blessing, or something
like that, we believe. Yet The Bulletin has
published Innumerable poems about the Queen
and other members of the Royal Family, without
ever getting one word of thanks

Poor old John Kennedy was taking a walk
up EDzabeth-street, Melbourne, when he was ob-
served to totter and fall. It was rather Incon-
venient that John's body should be stretched
across the pathway, but save by a gentle kick or
two, the old man’s misdemeanour was not com-
mented upon. The crowds of people passing br
treated John with marked respect. In a generaj
way, they walked round his body, occasionally
they jumped over it, but they were never, never
so unmannerly as to touch it. The rude hand of
a policeman was the first to turn John Kennedy
over on his back, and then they discovered that
he was neither drunk nor in a fit. No; John had
merely been a corpse for two hours.
The professional humourists of all coun-
tries have, when short of matter, written a funny
story (it is much the same in all the languages we
are acquainted with) of a burglar breaking into
the house of an editor, and, being moved to
pity by the poverty he saw there, leaving a half-
crown on the washstand and going softly away
with a tear in his eye. Other versions have it that
the editor wakes up, and, discovering t r .e burglar,
greets him as his preserver, and borrows what
loose cash he hai about him to provide the family
breakfast. But we looked upon all these stories
as pleasant but improbable inventions up till now.
We were never able to picture to ourselves a
burglar so lacking in worldly knowledge and
savoirfaire as to waste his time in trying to rob a
pressman. Such a burglar has, however, been
found. We copy the following paragraph from
the Melbourne Hbbald s—“ Messrs. Cameron,
Laing, and Co., of Flinders-lane, report a case of
store-breaking at their premises. During the
night of the 14th the burglars effected an entrance
to the place by bursting open the trap-door.
Everything was ransacked, but nothing has been
missed.” Nothing has been missed I We should
think not. Cameron, Laing, and Co. are gentle-
men who publish a supplement for the country
papers. The stock on their premises chiefly con-
sists of manuscript poems.
A too-ardent lover was Mr. Rowdon,
gentleman, of no-where-ln-particular, England.
He conceived a violent affection for the Hon.
Violet Lane-Fox, and, not having the honour of her
acquaintance, strove to acquire it by “ mashing ”
her whenever she took her walks abroad. Unable
to obtain any return for bis affection in this way,
he attended a garden-party given by Lord Salis-
bury, although uninvited, and climbed to the
apex of assurance by asking his host for an intro-
duction to the Hon. Violet, whom he knew to be
present But the lady, seeing her tormentor
approach, erected a voluminous scowl upon her
aristocratic features and departed with muoa
haste. Foiled in this strategic effort, Mr. Rowd >n
precipitated a climax by inserting in the Morning
Post an announcement of his engagement with
Miss Fox, whereupon he was made to lojk ov‘r
the spikes and explain why he should not be
up for criminal libel. He will probably have to
go, and pay the penalty of having loved not wisely
but too well, what magnificent amatory poetry
he could write 7 Love is never so luminous in
verse as when it is aimless, hopeless, and an ever-

ney Lancers are a naval force—a sort of horse
marines, or dugong cavalry— after all. On Satur-
day, the citizens of the N.S.W. metropolis were
expected to believe that an enemy had landed
near Bondi for a dash at the city, and among them
ware the Lancers, who appear to have galloped
over the brine, and formed themselves into hollow
touares on the top of the sad sea waves. Last year
this gorgeous brigade were in a very similar
position, and they rode calmly along under a ter-
rific fire while General Fremantle, late of .the
Soudan, said with a groan:—“Oh, these are the
Lancers, are they ? They, of course, are to con-
sider themselves slaughtered to a.man. A Sydney
Lanceah, It seems, doesn’t even know when be is

A petition has been presented to the
Governor of Victoria praying that Britain should
gobble up the New Hebrides lest the
should be overrun with bad Frenchmen. The
document b?ars about 130 crosses, each of which
is supposed to represent the autograph of a cater.
As a rule, when the New Hebrideans want to dgn
a tr< aty or anything of the kl “ d
toseth- r in solemn conclave and subscribe tne
agreement ay cutting a notch in a tree, oi: gnawing
off one joint of a cow’s tail, or sitting down in a
bag of flour, or drinking a gourd full of whisky
and then eating the gourd, but we presume the
petition la authentic ail the same. But even witn
120 niggers to back up federated Australia in this
matter, it is rather too late to think of embezzling
the New Hebrides.
I The Christian conference, which sat last
week at Melbourne, has come to the conclusion
that Victoria is going to the dogs through ungodly
dancing, and appeals to Christian mothers to pre
vent their daughters assisting in a half-olothea
condition at this unbishopllke amusement. A oer-
talaMr.Paton, from the New Hebrides,evenas
serte that his catechised and £ibllsed savages
would blush right down to their shins at the sig
of a Victorian baU-room, and anyone who knows
how much bare nigger and how little clothes go to
make up a South Sea savage will understand the
size of this emetlon. Also he thinks the same
heathen would faint if he saw busses and tramoars
running on Sunday, and it would be necessary to
bang him on the head with a tract to bring him to.
But we fear the dances and the tramoars will go
on all the same, and the cocoa-nut Idolater may
faint If he pleases.
The Town and Country Journal states
that an Auckland merchant has “ committed sui-
cide by apparently discharging the contents or a
gun Into his mouth, as he was found sitting on a
chair with a gun between his knees and a 'wotmd
in the hack of Ms ntek." This Is the most remark-
able suicide on record. If an Auckland man takes
an apparent gun between his knees a ° d
his mouth, yet shoots himself in the back of the
neck, he must either have worn the back of his
neck In front, or his knees must have been behind.
In the latter case he would have to scratch tne
small of his back with his an d.ln the
former, we presume he would hoist his tea-cup
over the top of his head, for his jiw would be
behind. Very few men, too, die through appa-
rently ” shooting themselves, but after viewing
the apparent corpse the fiends of the man with
the remarkable neck have concluded the job has
been done successfully.
A Melbourne hotelkeeper has been most
unjustly fined for Sunday trading. It happened
In this way. Mrs. Klrkham has a loved and only
daughter, the jov and comfort of her mother s de-
clining years. Sickness overtook the poor gin,
and last Sunday week she seemed like to die. The
agonised mother bent over her daughter s pnlow
and enquired If there was anything Bha could get
to soothe her last moments, ihe invalid raised
herself upon one elbow and whispered colonial
beer.” Quick as thought, Mrs, K. hurried off to
the nearest hotel upon her sacred mlsdon. Dor a
while the landlord’s wife was obdurate, but finally
the mother’s pleadings prevailed. “ Give me them
I two bottles, and save my child s life, she said.
The landlady yielded, and was lost. A policeman
spotted the transaction, a summons was issued,
and a£s fine Imposed. This teaches hotelkeepers
a lesson. Never sell colonial beer for healing pur-
poses. Merely dispense it like other liquors-as a
pizon.
“W. H. B.” is permitted for some un-
fathomable reason to write a snuffling letter in
the Sydney D.T. on “Music as an Aid to Devo-

grand effect the wooden houses of the colonies
have on improving sound; In fact, they act like
sounding-boards.” Yes, “W. H. 8., they do. In

cursed land there Is a jerry-built time-payment

A Poem
(Published in a London Mngaziae by Mr. Day, of
Lincoln’s Inn Fields, April, 17871.
Ye favor’d Botanists, permit a muse
Whose eye enraptured your importance views
In friend ly numbers and with truth expressed
To raise unceasing transport in your breast;
On England turn your permanent esteem
And make her bounty your applauding themel
What throne, but her’s, to so untaught a race
Could send such peerless ministers of grace?
Equip so blest and competent a fleet,
And scarce reduce one vlllam in ner street ?
Export such cargoes of her choicest ,
And still retain such unexhausted stores ?
No latent scheme her charity controls.
Her heart expands in pity for your souls!
And urged by motives splendidly sublime.
Which dare the keenest scrutiny of time,
Her noblest arts and artisans exports
The very soul and essence of her courts I
In these her villains in a low estate
Behold a model of ter pampered great.
Who, without poverty s excuse to plead.
Are but grandfathers of this poorer breed I
Completely vile, deliberately base.
Without the fear or knowledge of disgrace.
They spread as locusts—titles their defence.
Gained without honour, rectitude, or sense.
Sold as a license in this peddling clime
For every sneaking sin, and every giant crime!
In this, her present, unimpaired you see
The Infant foetus of a grand levee.
Which the State midwives from the mother drew
And sent them pickled and preserv ed, to you 111
The scripture’s volume this command extends,
If thou hast plenty, share it with thy friends;
Obedient Britain the command receives.
And kindly shares her plenty in her-thieves;
And to confirm she’s read the Bible through.
She shares her plenty in her harlots too.
How shall my muse such philanthropy tell.
To prove her zeal for God, she leads you all to—Hell 1
Hall native land, where arts of every kind
Are nurtured, honour’d, patronis’d' refin’d.
On our approach, ye natives of the Bay,
Welcome your saviours with a loud huzza;
Your toi resign—your holiday begin,
And with chaste carols hymn your prophets in:
Bow down, ye elders, and ye matrons too,
Embrace their knee—bring saeriflee in view;
Nay, be more meek, and, with approaches low,
Treat them as Popes, and Hiss the sacred toe,
Whose dire impression on your luckless shore
Millions shall mourn, and curse for evermore;
Disease shall reign (her baleful flag unfurl’d),
And breathe contagion through your little world;
Rapine and lust uprear their hellish yoke,
And peals of blasphemy truth’s God provoke;
Unheard transgressions howl their horrid birth
And fly malignant o’er the blasted earth—
Till even Britain, with an humbled mind.
Resign perdition’s path, content to walk behind I
Botany Bay
In the month of December, 1786, the following
verses were published in an English magazine
Away with these whimsical bubbles of air
Which only excite a momentary stare;
Attention to plans of utility pay,
Weigh anchor, and steer for Botany Bay.
Let no one think much of a trifling expense.
Who knows what may happen a hundred years
hence ?
The loss of America what can repay ?
New colonies seek for at Botany Bay.
O’er Neptune’s domain, how extensive the scope,
Of quickly returning, how defiant the hope.
The Canes must be doubled, and then bear away
Three thousand good leagues to reach Botany
Bay.
Of those precious souls who for nobody care
It seems a large cargo the kingdom can spare,
To ship off a gross or two, make no delay,
They cannot too soon go to Botany Bay.
They go of an island to take special charge.
Much warmer than Britain, and ten times as large,
No custom-house duty, no freightage to pay,
And tax-free they live when at Botany Bay.
This garden of Eden, this new promised land,
Ihe time to set sail for will soon be at hand;
y ® worst of land-lubbers, make ready for sea,
.there s room for you all about Botany Bay.
As scores of each sex to this land must proceed

Some ide-Lights on the Indo Colonial
Exhibition.
London, July 7.
Dear Bulletin,— l have attained no fame
by the Exhibition so far, but then I am not a Com-
missioner, and Mr. *van Jones, of Sydney, Is.
Apart irom the advantages natural to that ap-
pointment, the Hunter-street (Sydney) jeweller Is
a man of push. What the HS J. falls to get by
persuasion he effects by coercion. His energy
was so pronounced that the late Sir A. Stuart was
wont to amble off r und the nearest and biggest
exhibit when his confrere from Hunter-street
hove In sight, and poor Sir Saul is now obliged to
resort to similar tactics, it was too bad of the
authorities in Sydney to “sool ” the jeweller on to
the Commissioners here as a private citizen,
Evan might have been defied with impunity, and
with the assistance of the police like any ordinary
colonial visitor, but bis commlsMonershlp is—in
cricketing parlance—a ball that Isstmpiy unplay-
able. The result is that the N.S W. court is Mr«
Evan Jones’ court. Including the huge medal-
Btamping press, which covers a large area, and
wntre a roaring trade la done in "Exhibition
medals ’’struck off before your eyes, he ho'ds two
other stands, at one of which he is also permitted
to sell photographic views. Now, considering
that the last-named privilege was denied a Sydney
photographer—which K.J. is not—the affair cer-
tainly requires explanation.
* ♦ *
As you will readily gather from the fore-
going remarks, Mr. Junes is socially übiquitous.
If he makes up his mind to be present at a fete or
a dinner, it’s a thousand pounds to a shirt-button
that he fa present. And he usually does make up
his mind. The Agents-General do not love him,
but they ask him to their houses, and they see that
he is included In the Invitations to all the big
Anglo-Australian grub-wrangllegs, no matter how
many royal dukes are to be present. -Although
his name was not published in connection with
the Windsor affair. I’m open to take reasonable
odds that he was there, and that he had as much to
say to the Queen as anyone else.

Would you like to bean intimate friend of
the Prince of Wales—so intimate as to De permitted

like to boss huge exhibitions, having all the con-
tracts, etc., etc., etc., passing through your hands?
Would you like but why go on ?Ot course you
would like to be Sir P. C. Owen, and so would I.
Sir Philip is a clever man. Here is his latest
move, put simply, and “in the original ” “ Wales,
old boy,” he said, “tell you what we 11 do. We’ll
get these colonist fellows to make us a present of
ail the exhibits Then we'll get the Government
to make us a handsome grant, and we’ll put up a
huge building, stuff the exhibits into it, call it a
museum, and there you are, don’t you know.”
“And you will boss it, at a thumping big screw, for
the rest of your days,” remarked Walts, with a
knowing smile. “ Well, yes, that’s about it,” as-
sented Owen, frankly; “you see I’m getting old
and grey, and it’s time I settled down.” “All right.

r One thousand pound* was placed in the
hands of the Executive Commissioner for the
purpose of entertaining the colonial visitors. Sir
Alexander Stuart gave one or two lunches, I be-
lieve, but about £970 of that “ thou.” must still be
left. Who’s going to spend it I wonder ? And
what is to become of that £lOO a month ? If Sir
Saul Samuel is to do the work I should think he
ought to get the coin. By the way.it seems to me that
the harder people work the less money they get,
and vice versa. Listen- Loftus gets £BO per month

monthly. Mr. H. B. Hardt (an exhibition hand of
great experience) bas done more work in connec-
tion with the N.S. W. court both before and since the
opening than most ot the others put together.
He was first appointed Clerk of Works by Sir Saul
Samuel, and he is now called superintendent. He
is always tbeie. from early morning till last thing
at night. He is the only man who “knows all
about it,” and he is always ready to share his
knowledge. And his salary is £l2 los. per month.
For his services up to the opening day, Mr. G. C.
Levey received £2OO, a very moderate figure in-
deed, for it may almost be said if there bad been
no Mr. G. C. L. (with his boundless experience,
energy, and enthusiasm), there would have been
no N.S W Court. I am very glad that Levey has
been appointed Secretary to the Commission (in
London) of the South Australian Jubilee Exhibi-
tion, and that our hard-working Hardt has good
offers both from B.A and Victoria.

“Editor Bulletin, —Sir—l am afraid I
am not a very good Christian, but I am, alas, next
door to one, and I am also next door to a public
house, In other words, I am wedged in between
as hotel and a cburob, and after a long experience
of the two, I want to know If I can’t suppress the
house of prayer, and get another godless hotel
there instead. Even if perdition could be shifted
next door it would be a trifling nuisance compared
to the church, with its eternal bell and Its eternal
services—lts singing, chanting, and howling. For
some weeks my brother’s wife, poor little woman,
was lying very ill at her house, and the ceaseless
booming from the adjacent sacred establishment
—the church, I mean—aggravated her malady.
At last, one Sunday morning, a crisis arrived, and
quiet being essential, 1 appealed to the parson
next door to give the patient a show for her life
by keeping his infernal belfry silent for one day
at least; also to pound the Word in a lower key
than usual, and take the higher notes of his ser.
mon as read. He gazed on me with mute astonish-
ment as I made this request, and then solemnly
responded that his mission was to dispense the
water of life, and that he had been called,
&0., &c. That evening he preached with
the windows open, and every now and then
he would boom out something about • salvation,’
or hell, or redemption, at the top of bis Stall-fed
voice, which made the sufferer start from her
uneasy morphia-begotten slumbers. His bell, too,
was as loud and vicious as ever, and that same
night my unfortunate sister-in-law had to be
taken away from the little home which held her
and her paralysed husband and removed to the
hospital, where, I grieve to say, she seems to be
slowly dying. She is an honest, patient, little
woman, as truly Christian in spirit as any one of
the many self-denying clergymen I have known,
and I ask you, sir, whether it is not outrageous
that she should be subjected to such hideous tor-
ture in order that the alleged Christian gentleman
next door should conform to this worn-out fetish
of bell-clanging ? I would like to know whether
the same law which allows a parson to ring a bell
for half an hour as a sign that he is going to pray
would interfere with me if I beat a big drum in
the street for 30 minutes just to let my neighbours
know when lam going to bed. I suppose it would.
- Yours truly, Jacob Ed, Fowler.” [ Why doesn’t
our correspondent “go” fjr the clergyman by
prosecuting him at law for a nuisance ? If that
course prove ineffectual, he will have the sym-
pathy of all honest citizens when he is tried for
contumeliously breaking the reverend one’s head
or sacrilegiously cutting the bell-rope.— Ed. B.j

tables.
“If,” says a Sydney daily, “Sir Alfred
Stephen’s Divorce Extension Bill had passed a
year ago, the murdered Mrs. Bhoda Catherine
Reynolds would be alive to-day, with her children
about her, and a long career of happy usefulness
before her.” Yes if she had had enough money
to pay the Coonans.
The latest thing in London is the “ revival
masher,” a kind of aristocratic Salvationist in
evening dress. The "saved” masher habitually
wears a swallow-tail as a sign of Inward grace, and
men who do not possess these garments are. of
course, not eligible to be saved in this way. The
ladles, when they find religion, adopt low-necked
dresses, and the more cuticle they show, the more
religion they are supposed to have found. Among
the leaders of the band, the religion extends all
down the spine.
THE PRIMROSE DAME.
“She sheddeth her fragrance around you in
showers;
It was wrung from the lives of oiir human
flowers.
Without thought of shame or blame;
And the rose of health, that was ruthlessly torn
From the children’s cheeks, is wantonly worn
In the robes of the Primrose Dame.”
—Gerald Massey.
The keystone to the whole Australian
pyramid of asses seems to be an individual who
signs himself “ Algernon ” in the Sydney Evening
News. He has reached, he says, the age of 34, and
is still so much alive that he Is anxious to settle
down to “marital bliss,” and would correspond
with a young “ demoiselle,” with a view to the
“ inevitable matrimonial result.” He has excellent
prospects, is good-looking, “ and is altogether an
extremely Interesting young gentleman.” “ Al-
gernon,” we should say, is “in the drarery,” Any
alleged man who is “interesting,” must be in the
drapery.
At a pow-wow of Indians, on Columbia
River, the subject of white women’s “bustles”
was discussed by chiefs, squaws, and medicine
men. One squaw took a bag of feathers, tied it
behind her, and imitated the way in which the
pale-faced women walk with them on. A warrior
guessed it was to catch insects. Another thought
it had something to do with the perspiration. At
last the old doctor—the medicine man—from
whose decision there is no appeal, gave the signal
for silence, and then said, “ That the white women
bad not so good forms as the Indian women, and
that the white men were very fond of good forms,
and that the white women wore these bags to
make the white men think they were well
formed.” He then sat down amid repeatec
grunts.
Queen Victoria abhors flirting. When her
eldest daughter was a coquettish and wayward
miss of 13, she, on one occasion, showed, as the
Queen noticed, a disposition to be rather familiar
and to flirt with some young officers of the escort.
Her Majesty gave several reproving looks; but
they were lost upon the high-spirited “ Vicky,”
who was thoroughly enjoying herself. At length,
in dangling her handkerchief over the side of the
open carriage, she dropped it—too evidentally not
accidentally. Instantly two or three young heroes
sprang from their saddles to return it to her fair
hand; but the awful voice of royalty stayed them.
"Stop, gentlemen I” exclaimed the Queen;
"leave it just where it lies. Now, my daughter,
get down from the carriage and pick your hand-
kerchief up.” Which she had to do.
The Moruya (N.S.W.) Cottage Hospital
seems to be an expensive place to die in, and even
the toughest and most dignified of worms would
turn when pecked at by the hon. secretary of that
institution with his little bill. According to
the local paper a poor woman was recently re-
moved there, and during the six days she spent in
dying she ran up an account for £8 3a., in addition
to which she cost £4 for medical attendance, and
£4 for burial, or £l6 3s in all. At this rate, if she
had lived 13 months in the institution, and been
burled only once a week during that time, the
damage would have been £839 16s. It is fiurther
reported that she was unconscious during the last
three days of her life, and as she is debited with
Ihree bottles of brandy and one of wine, all pre-
sumably consumed during 72 hours, this circum-
stance will not excite surprise. She is also sup-
posed to have eaten 10s. worth of groceries, these
being probably required to keep the liquor down,
and to have cost the wardsman, in bother and
anguish the sum of £3 145., and the matron £1
“ Wood and water lls ” is an item which is about
equivalent to a ton of the former, and IfiOO gallons
of the latter. Djiag at the rate of nearly £B4O a
year is a luxury that very few could afford. It
would be considerably cheaper to remain alive.
Melbourne, August 11.—Editor Bulletin,
—1 daresay in your lifetime you’ve received a
great many complaints from females, Just as a
aoctor is troubled often with female complaints ;
and now I come to add my grain of sand to your
burth*i. lama large woman—“a big woman,”
as the world says—and what I want to know is
why should a big woman be judged to be able to
take care of herself in the smallest degree more
than a small woman ? I measure five leet seven,
and am built stout in proportion, and if a remark
ii passed it is, “Oh, so-and-so, she is quite able to
take care of herself.” Now why should that be so ?
Why should a woman with all a woman’s weak-
nesses, and a woman’s heart beating inside of a
woman’s corsets and body, because she has en-
croached a little on a man’s inches be judged by
the world to be specially able “to take care of
herself,” while a woman of five feet three, if in
danger or difficulty, is helped on all sides ? " Poor
little woman I” is what you will hear everywhere,
and every masculine face expresses the sympathy
It feels for tbe subject. Why, sir, may I ask,
should this injustice continue ? Is a mere matter
of inches to keep a female from meeting that sym-
pathy of soul which should spring spontaneous
irom every manly bosom. . . . My husband has
just come to tea. He is five feet four, and raises
Gain if it’s net ready,-so concluding in haste, I
xemain, dear Editor, yours, &0., Susan.
A governess writing to Health on “ Wasp
Waists,” gives her experiences of tight-lacing.
Here is a specimen;—" Miss , who was ‘coming
out about a month after my arrival, was bent upon
reducing the size of her waist to an inch less than
that of a young lady whose figure was very much
admired just then. Of course, to do this, new stays
were necessary, as those she was then wearing
were laced close. I went with her to the corset-
maker with whom the family dealt. Miss
ordered the corsets to bo ‘ very strongly boned,
and made long in shape.’ Every woman knows
that long stays mean more pinching. In a few
days the stays were sent home, and I was asked to
assist the maid In putting them on. When they were
fitted, tbe difficulty was to lace them close. They
were two inches smaller than the ones she usually
wore. At last they were drawn close, and my pupil
was an inch less than her rivals—namely, fourteen
inches. She fainted twice during the first day,
and did not go down at all, for she informed me,
begging me not to tell any one, that she was *in
an agony of pain.’ In about a fortnight, she
began to feel insensible to the pinching, and, as
for her mother, she was delighted.” And after
giving some more instances, she says:—“l could
give more instances, but your space will not per-
mit. I believe there exist but two remedies:—!.
The attacking of corset-wearing when young. A
grown woman who ‘laces’ will seldom give up
the practice 3. The adoption of a freer and
more sensible costume for girls. This last ought
not to be a difficult matter. I cannot understand,
I must confess, the opposition to the introduction
of‘dual garments,’when many mothers let their
daughters wear such short dresses that three or
four inches of very pronounced, if prettily frilled,
knickerbockers are to be seen.”
The wife of the President of the United
States deserves, if ever woman did, th* thanks
and praise of her sex forever. But unfortunate
males will neither praise nor thank her; or, if
they do. it will be in tones of gloomy sarcasm.
She has completely shattered that soothing theory
of lord-and-mastershlp which husbands held so
long. When it came to that part of the marriage
ceremony where she had to say that she would
“love, honour, and obey” her husband, she re-
peated the “ love” and “honour” without hesita-
tion, but there she stopped for an instant, and
then, in accents of decision, substituted "com-
fort ” for “ obey.” It is now open for all brides
to follow her Example. We hardly know whether
we are doing our duty by our own sex In making
this pernicious precedent public. Wives have, be-
fore now, made the vow of obedience sufficiently
elastic to do what they pleased without appearing
to break the letter of it. What, then, may we ex-
pect them to do with the promise to “ comfort ’’ ?
Bach will act according to her own idiosyncrasy.
But we may make up our minds that the meaning
will be her own comfort 1 As thus—she wishes to
go to a ball, and she knows tha„ her husband dls-
LOUIS, THE MAD KING OF BAVARIA.
Louis, who was drowned in a pond some weeks ago, has been succeeded on the
Bavarian throne by another madman, Otto, who is trying to starve himself to death.
approves of balls. She also knows that if she asks
his permission he will refuse it and that she will
get mad and tell him that he is a tyrant, reproach
Elm with his change of conduct since the days of
their courtship, threaten him with her mother,
refer in sneering terms to the number of dresses
she has had in her married, as compared with what
she had in her single days, and finally wind up by
going to the ball anyway. She knows that it
would bo great comfort to him not to hear all this
and—goes off without asking him. The masculine
mind would probably call this conduct casuistical,
but the feminine conscience wftuld hold it to be
strictly permissible, and even virtuous. There is a
nice time in store for young men about to marry.
Thank the gods we have planted the memorial
shells of affection upon the grave of our third, and
—ne more for us I
For years religionists have cherished the
story of Queen Victoria’s having told the envoy
of a dusky potentate who was desirous of knowing
the reason of England’s greatness, that the Secret
lay in England’s devotion to the Bible. Alas and
alack! we have the word of Sir Henry Ponsoaby
—the same Sir Henry who conveyed to Jubilee
Young, of Sydney, the Queen’s thanks for his
congratulations on the forty-ninth anniversary of
her accession—that the anecdote has not a grain
of truth in it A Sussex gentleman wrote to the
Castle on the subject, it appears, and in reply the
Queen’s right-hand mao, by one stroke of the pen,
showed that the favourite Sunday-school story is
merely the product of the imagination, and has no
foundation in truth. If things go on in this hor-
rible way, there will be nothing left for us to
believe in soon.
Here is another melancholy proof of the
weakness and depravity of human nature. The
real genuine converted Chinee, who paraded at
the head of the Salvation Army in Bogolong
parades no longer, anu now that town has not got
the bulge on any other portion of the globe. The
conversion was not so deep in as it might be, and a
big chunk of old Adam still clung to that heathen
Chinee, in spite of his knee-drill and other reli-
gious exercises. Jimmy Ah Chow, after a spasm
of outward piety, started a campaign on his own
Celestial hook, and rapidly gravitated in the direc-
tion of rum. When last observed, after lowering
down several inches of the local tanglefoot, he
could just articulate: “ Blme by, allee same get
long’em pen’tent form, save ’em again, good as
ever. You shout lum ?” And the pride and glory
of the Go belong Salvation Army—to whom
Jimmy was as the billy-goat to the Soudan Con-
tingent-staggered off to lay in a larger stock of
rum and subsequent repentance.
The Jubilee of Sewage.
The public health seems to be carefully studied
n Sydney. At Forest Lodge, a road and a plateau
—the latter, presumably, to bo used as a founda-
tion for dwelling-houses—are being made with
eight feet of nlghtsoil, ashes, dead cats, dogs,
fowls, and pigs, and miscellaneous garbage, all
cemented together with typhus and small-pox,
and disguised by six inches of earth on top. This
rubbish is said to be brought in Corporation carts,
and dumped down in its present situation under
the direction of Corporation savagery. Dr. Ash-
burton Thompson, who has Inspected the place,
reports that the use of the land for building pur-
poses should be rendered a criminal offence, but
we presume it will be built upon none the leas,
and then the owner will go into Parliament, be-
come a churchwarden, and die of drain-fever,
respected by all who knew him. A great many
people, no doubt, wonder why such things should
have been permitted so long, but the explanation
is simple: the chief municipal authorities who
gorge themselves at civic banquets and go mad on
the question of bull-headed imperialism, appear to
care not one solitary jubilee curse whether people
are murdered by this atrocious system or not.
When the noxious and offensive Trades’ En-
quiry Commission was sitting in the early part
of 1883, Alderman (now Mayor) Young gave
evidence that would have shocked the finer
feelings of a Hottentot, and made even a Kim-
berley nigger feel bad. The following ques-
tions and' answers will give a slight idea of the
civic esteem for that cleanliness which in Sydney
comes next to perdition;—“Dr. Mackellar: ‘Can
you tell us whether the Municipal Council exer-
cises any control over the noxious business of
nightmen?’ Mr. Young:‘Well, they ought to.’ Dr.
Mackellar: ‘ Have they any powers with regard to
it?’ Mr. Young: ‘lt Is one of those things that they
ought to do, but unfortunately they have no place
toputthenightsoil.’ . . . Dr.Mackellar:‘Where
do they put it ?’ Mr. Young: ‘That Ido not know.’
. . Mr. Fremlin: ‘You (meaning, we sup-
pose, not Mr. Young Individually, but the
Corporation) *do not care whom you injure so
long as you get rid of itV Mr. Young: ‘No.’
Dr. Mackellar: ‘The men engaged in this business
of removing the nlghtsoil carry it on, I suppose,
for their own sakes as cleanly as they can ?’ Mr.
Young: ‘ I cannot say.’ Dr. Mackellar; ‘ Do not the
Corporation see that it is done properly—is there
no officer of the Corporation who has anything to
do with it?’ Mr. Young: ‘ I have never heard of
one.’ ” Up to this point, It will be observed, Jubi-
lee Young knew nothing, but the next question
elicited the first item in his store of know-
ledge, and his knowledge proved to be
considerably more filthy and malodorous than
his former dense ignosanoe. Mr. Young’s sewage
lore may be summed up thus: There is noplace
near Sydney to deposit offensive refuse, and, con-
sequently, it is dumped down “surreptitiously;”
“ I have heard of it being thrown by the side of a
road,” added the witness, apparently as calmly as
If he were merely asking the Commission to have
a jubilee drink; avast quantity of refuse is de-
posited in cesspits, the suburbs being even worse,
in this respect tnan the city; three-fourths of the
sewers run into the harbour, and at Darling Har-
bour, Dawes Point, and Woolloomeoloo Bsy the
place is saturated with sewage-matter. Mr. Young
next admitted that the sewerage was proba-
bly at times more deadly than the system
connected with noxious trades of the city,
but he suggested no remedy, and then he
drifted off into a number of disagreeable
disclosures about slaughter-bouses and boil-
ing-down establishments, which served to show
how many horrible things one alderman could
know without his appetite being spoiled thereby.
Before his evidence was finished he proved con-
clusively that Sydney takes the cake for filth
among the great cities of the world, and that the
citizens are pre-eminent among the unsightly
crowd who regard dirt with pig-like complacency
as an unavoidable condition of things. The N.S.W.
metropolis is qualifying to the beat of its
ability for a visitation worse than the
cholera or the Black Death, and when the visita-
tion comes, if Providence can aim straigh enough
to hit a pup with a hop-bitters bottles, the “city
fathers ” will be among the first to go. After that
it will be time enough for the skeleton with the
scythe and hour-glass to look after the rest of the
dirty saints of Australia. When some fearful
pestilence reaches us there will, of course, bo
weeping and wailing and prayer, and days set
apart for national humiliation, and good men will
Inform us that It is a judgment because of too
much sin and too little psalm and collection-plate,
and bad men will get drunk and die drunk, but
none of those who whoop up the Bible-gang in
times of peace are likely to tell the honest truth—
that the pestilence is from the sewers below in-
stead of from the heavens above. And, for our
part, when that time comes, as it inevitably will
unless a great reform made, we will kneel down
amidst piles of unburied corpses and rejoice that
the only event which could inculcate cleanliness
in Sydney has come to pass, and that our clvlo
apostles of filth stand a chance at last of being
hastily removed to a land where cleanliness is
reckoned of more account than jubilee.
The O’Sullivan.
wh B m^w SULLIVAN * member for Queanbeyan
in the N.S.W. Assembly, a pencil-sketch of whom
appears on the first page of this week’s Bulletin
is, in many respects, a very remarkable man. Ho
has helped to run more newspapers, has led more
political reform agitations, and delivered more
democratic exhortations than any other man who
ever looked upon the Southern Cross. Ho was
born in Launceston, Tasmania, but an early love
of adventure prompted him to emigrate to South
Australia when only three weeks old. Subse
quently he returned to his native laud and served
his apprenticeship as a printer in the office of the
Hobart Mercury. At the expiration of hisap-
f" en 1 t 0 1 ° eBhl P he viBited Sydney, where he remained
till 1870, when he returned to Tasmania at the
mature age of 30, started the Tasmanian Tribune
which flourished under the auspices of its founder!
and sold out In 1873. Mr. O’Sullivan then went to
Melbourne, organized a co-operative company,
and started another paper, the Evening Tribune
which did not enjoy a very prosperous career.,
for it faded quietly out of existence when
it had conspleted its thirteenth month. As editor
of the St. Arnaud Mercury, Mr. O’Sullivan took
a strong hand in the agitation which ended in the
triumph of the Berry party in 1877; and the victory
of J. L. Dow, now Minister for Lands in Victoria
was in great part owing to the influence of this
paper and its editor. Mr. O Sullivan returned to
Melbourne in 1879, and was immediately elected to
the presidency of the local Typographical Society,
where his aggressive genius found lots of scope
and led to several useful social Innovations in
matters pertaining to the craft. In 1881 Mr
O’Sullivan returned to Sydney, and has been act-
ing the part of a Democratic agitator ever since.
He was the founder of the Democratic Alliance
an organisation which at one time threatened to
raise political Cain, but ultimately was not Able.
Co-operating with Mr. Heydon.the O’Sullivan was
instrumental in founding the Land and Industrial
Alliance, under whose auspices the conference of
1855 was held, when Land Reform, Protection, and
Payment of Members were adopted as the present
objects of N.S.W. Liberalism. In 1883 Mr. O’Sullivan
stood for West Sydney, but the joint efforts of the
living and the dead were too much for him, and
he suffered a defeat, repeated in South Sydney at
the last general election. Better fortune met him
at Queanbeyan, for which constituency he occu-
pies a very safe seat. He is a prominent figure in
the Assembly, where his uncompromising attitude,
vigorous, if not elegant, oratory, and quosi-pugi!
Ustio appearance and determination, earn him a
considerable amount of respect. At present he
is agitating about a lot of reforms, especially of
shipping abuses, which are under Investigation
by a committee of which he is chairman. He is
about 35 years of age, and may be roughly de-
scribed as a combination of Samuel PUmsoll,
Cicero, John L, Sullivan, and Caius Gracchus. He
is the kind of man whom one would rather be
fighting with than against, which is more than
can be said for the majority of members in the
New South Wales Assembly.
Thus a London writer “ Prince Albert
Victor, it appears, is not much smarter at trout-
fishing than he is at other things he attempts. The
nation would like to know what this young man
can do, and it is really important that it should
have proof of his ability in some direction, as in
the ordinary course of things he will be King of
England later on. His Royal Highness would be
an ornament to a draper’s counter, but as to
whether he would equally adorn a throne we have
our doubts.
At Cooma (N.S.W.) when anyone steals an
egg. or shifts a howling midnight dog with a half-
brick, the local paper is invariably equal to the
occasion A Cooma settler was, the other day,
feloniously deprived of half a loaf, and, after
ascribing the act to "an organised gang”—of
brigands, we presume—the Express tears its free
ana enlightened shirt over the incident akd says:
• Sheltered by the almost inaccessible, hideous
solitudes of stupendous mountains and forests
primeval, they fear not the prying eye of that
inexorable func ionary-our senior constable,”
Prom this it is evident the gang fled into the
wilderness with the half loaf. If Cooma had been
a sea-port they would no doubt have carried the
plunder on board their blood-stained bark, and
then started on a wild buccaneering cruise over
the raging main.
When the Queen opened the Holloway
College for Women, the service in the college
chapel was, curiously enough, addressed rather to
the Queen than to God, a state of things that the
Archbishop of Canterbury apparently saw no im-
propriety in whatever. Th prayer beseeching
Heaven’s patronage of the institution followed
the ode complimenting Her Majesty. “This upside-
down arrangement,” says a home paper, “shocked
nobody, for toe reason, perhaps, that scarcely a
soul pretended to pay the least attention to any-
thing, except the elaborate decorations of the roof
and walls of the chapel, and the bald head of the
Duke of Connaught, which a number of ladies ap-
Pk r «utly took the greatest interest in, most of
them knowing, no doubt, that early sparseness of
hair is a mark of goaly living. The Duke, all un-
conscious of the attention that was being bestowed
upon him, was staring upwards in rapt contem-
plation of the florid pourtrayal of ‘ The Creation
of Eve,’ that lady being represented as a plump
and pleasing person, with limbs of alarming pro-
portion. This same artistic effort was a matter
of some uneasiness to the Archbishop, who re-
garded it disapprovingly upon his entrance. The
chapel being intended for the use of women, the
picture will prove harmless, but it would have a
most distracting effect upon any males who at-
tended to worship there.”

H. E. and Lady Canngton were present
at the first representation of “ The Great Divorce
Case,” on Saturday, the Slst Inst. They were
accompanied by the Hon. John Bsring, and
attended by Captain Wallington, P.C. Lady Car-
ington was very becomingly dressed in a light
gown of Indian tussore, trimmed with laoe. She
held a very beautiful bouquet In her hand, the
gift of the management. The house was crowded
in every part, H. ®. draws better than locomotive
engines. The dresses worn by the ladles were
mostly cut low—so busts were in plenty, and bare
arms—some rather red—in great profusion The
piece Itself consisted chiefly of the old busi-
ness of broad allusions and embarrassing situa-
tions-the gentleman in the lady’s boudoir busi-
ness—Lonsdale positions—outraged husband, &c
but there was one new thing, and it was in a
gentleman’s feet being put under the lady’s dress
and made to appear like her own. At first he suc-
ceeded, until a detective saw the fraud- you can’t
take in a detective; and as the lady’s dress rose,
the house oame down. It was altogether a deli-
cate and well thought out situation, and likely to
become popular in “ society.”

Some of the Victorian bigwigs took part
In a new and original farce last week. The per-
formance was none the less slde-ppHtting because
its fun was unintentional. His Excellency the
Gov., with Lady Loch, the two little Loohs, the
Ministry, and a myriad of minor lights, went down
to Footsoray to launch the new screw-steamer
‘‘Lady Lcn ’ The building of this boat-tha
la rgest yet turned out from a Victorian dockyard
—has mused a good deal of delirium; her launch-
ing was to be a function of exceeding brilliancy.
But the Fates were unKmd. In the flm place,
the intended ceremony had the weather “ agin it ”
Secondly, the boat which conveyed a distinguished
company down the Yarra, kept sticking in the
mud. But worst of all, the grand sorew-nteamer
“Lady Lnch” refused to be coaxed into toe
water. Little Miss Loch was told olf for the lead-
ing part. With papa and mamma looking, 01 so
proud and happy, the young damsel duly touched
a button, and waited for the vetsel to slither down
the slips. In vain. Tne shipwrights used bad
language in a low tone, little Miss Loch looked
distressed, Master Loch sniggered derisively, the
Governor and his Lady tried not to appear ridicu-
lous, the Ministry darkly hinted that “ the
Russians were at the bottom of it”—but the good
ship “Lady Loch’ held her ground bravely. The
assembled population of Footscray began to make
merry at the expense of their Governor and bis
satellites. “ Wnat was to be the second part of
the programme?” said Sir Henry. Duncan
Gillies winked his eye, and cleverly simulated the
popping of a champagne-cork. ‘Exactly,” said
his Excellency, “ If we can t have the launch, let
us at least have the launcheon ” The Ministry
doubled itself up in counterfeited glee at the wit-
ticism, and the distinguished company betook
themselves to a marquee. There the dreary fizzle
was speedily forgotten under the influence of
sparkling fizz.

The Sydney Evening News records the
Invention of “a new covered salad-bowl, with
separate compartment for cucumber and onion,
which many people dislike mixed.” Which some-
how or other strongly reminds one of a modern
marriage, and looks like a cruel attempt to apply
the judicial separation and married women’s pro-
perty systems to the odoriferous onion and its
bland and succulent mate.

Taree (N.S.W.) boasts a reverend brother
in tne flesn, who, like many of the black-coated,
black hatted h st, objects to dancing. A week or
two ago he received an invitation to a bail, and
on the ensuing Sunday he rose in the pulpit to
make a long cherubic protest against such sinful
amusements, concluding thus: Unfortunately, 1
or fortunately, whichever way you like, my little
son (a mere infant) got the letter, and threw it into
tne fire, and when I saw him do it, I said I hoped
God would give mm sense in years to came to do
the same with ah such invitations.” This was a
cheap way of advertising the podgy little saint,
but we snould think a clerical iniaut who has
taken to thieving and incendiary ways at so early
an age should have been spanked with a board
rather than held aloft, like Moses brazen serpent,
for public admiration.

A reminiscence of the Indian and Colonial
ball at London Mansion House. Said an Indian

In our country we hire people to dance for us,

For two mortal hours on a recent after-
noon excited thousands were pushing, panting,
and perspirl g round the entrances to the Mel-
bourne Town Hall. Tin* side door in Collins-street

pavement and far into the roadway. They were
mostly ladies, clad in apparel of surpassing new-
ness, and evidently bent on business. In short, the
Mayoress was holding a reception, and every other
woman in Melbourne was going to it. A super-
cilious cao-drivsr, waiting outside the To vn Hall

Mr. L. F. Heydon, at his meeting in
Sydney on Friday night, gave Protection a useful
lift. His retrospect of the phases of the fiscal
struggle was strong and effective. Pour years ago,
when he entered parliamentary life, there was, as
he cleverly pointed out, no need for the contro-
versial labours of a Pulsford, nor for the fervid
oratory of Messrs. Held and Wise, for Free-trade
was then the established and prevailing belief, but
now oven Sir Henry Parkes compares the situa-
tion of the Oobdenites to that of the old woman
who from her bedroom window waved impotent
defiance at Stonewall Jackson’s army. The simile
was well chosen by Sir Henry, especially the old
woman part of It. A wondrous conversion has
been wrought during those four years, and a big
Share of the resulting credit is due to Mr. Heydon,
and should be the more cheerfully accorded on
account of the fierce uphill battle he had to fight
In the cause of Proseotlon, and the violent, un-
measured abuse It was once his lot to bear for the
sake of the cause which seems now to be almost
won.
The stray Ministerial lamb has returned
to the fold, and Mr. Bibbs Is once more at peace
with his colleagues. Perhaps, however, It Is hardly
fair to allude to the Colonial Secretary as a lamb
In this instance, for he answers more properly to
the designation of a tough old wether, but we do
not want to put his gristly qualities too promi-
nently before the public. Neither can he be cor-
rectly described as a fatted o»lf, for unlike that
grass-fed animal In the parable he has tscaped
•laughter, however much he may deserve it, so he
must continue to pass as a lamb for want of a bet-
ter term. So far, very little is known, except that
the Prodigal Son of Politics has resumed his port-
folio, and whether he has caved In with regard to his
appointments In the statistical department, or
whether the Cabinet has withdrawn the obnoxious
minute which led to so much trouble, doesn’t
matter much. A series of explanations are said
to have been made, and probably It Is now under-
stood that all unpleasant remarks on either side
are to be taken In a purely Pickwickian sense, or
else that they wore merely typographical errors
The question whether a Minister is j ustified In mak-
ing a number of Important appointments without
consulting his colleagues, is not likely to be settled
after all, for, If the law on this point Is laid down
In the Assembly, It will involve the necessity of
admitting that some one has been in the wrong,
and as a result of this humiliation, either Mr. Dibbs
might again quit the fold, or if he has been the
winner he might grow unduly bumptious and en-
deavour to run the entire Government machine on
his own account. The public are, therefore, not
likely to receive any really reliable explanation,
and all that Is known with certainty is that Mr.
Dibbs, after sulking for a while in his corner, has
oome out and la a good boy once more.
*» Editor Bulletin,— Sir—Tha Bulletin,
as all Australia knows, Is opposed to the Infliction
of the lash, and I claim that it speaks with the
voice of all genuine Australians. Tne average
narrow-minded politician, possessed of less brains
fhan a half-grown wombat, falls to understand
that the lash not only degrades and brutalises the
wretch who receives the punishment, but
brutalises and degrades the whole community.
Now, sir, I wish The Bulletin to know, I wish
Australia to know, and I wish the world to know,
that Sir Patrick Jennings, at Coonamble, In Octo-
ber last, when seeking re-election, denounced this
odious clause of the N.S.W. Criminal Law Consoli-
dation Aotand promised to use his influence in hav-
ing It erased from the Statute Book. On that occa-
sion, in reply to questions put by me as an elector
of the Bogan. Sir Patrick saidl do not consider
that the flogging clause of the Criminal Law Con-
solidation Act is ‘ necessary or essential to the
well-being of the community.’ lam and always
was opposed to the infliction of corporal punish-
ment. I opposed the clause when it was before
Parliament. The lash is a relic of barbarous ages
-a standing disgrace to this oolony-and If elected
I will use my influence to have the flogging clause
swept from our statute-book.’ I am not and never
have been a political admirer of Sir Patrick Jen-
nings, but though hostile to him I considered, and
still consider, that his views on this particular
subject are both manly and Christian-like, and
ought to be widely known. Now Is the time to
remind Sir Patrick Jennings of his promise, and
now is the time he is In a position to fulfil that
promise.—Yours truly, A. J. M‘Coobt, Trangle,
Aug. 31.”
The are between 70 and 80 ex-students of
the N S W. Training-school at present “ tempo-
rarily” employed la the schools of the colony.
The majority of these are temporary assistants In
'the city and suburban schools, and have been In
the service of the Department of Public Instruc-
tion for periods varying from five to seven years.
Many of them entered the service as pupil teachers
lathe country districts. The authorities appear
to admit that the salaries paid to pupil teachers are
insufficient for their support, and require the
parents or guardians of every pupil teacher to
guarantee to support them during the pupU-
teacher term. After four years spent in this capa-
city, they are admitted to the Training School, and
on leaving that Institution, are recommended
for certain classifications. These
■entitle them to salaries ranging from £l5O to £250
iper annum. But the department, Instead of ap-
ipointlng them to the positions to which their
■ classifications entitle them, employs them as
temporary assistants for indefinite periods, and
makes to them while thus employed “an allow-
ance” varying from £T to £lO per month.
The teachers of the schools to which they are
•‘temporarily ” appointed are tofurnlsa monthly
reports on their general conduct, and they are to
maintain discipline without appealing to corpora 1
punishment. Dissatisfied with their status, these
ex-students held a meeting, at which they decided
to lay their grievances before the Minister. Tnis
revolutionary conduct has caused quite a storm
amongst the highly-paid officials of the depart-
ment, who regard the conduct of the temporary
staff as “a menace to the department and a breach J
of its discipline.” Of course, it never entered into I
their simple minds to see that as long as the de-1
partment can retrench by making Its assistants I
work for half-pay, the largo-salaried men will get I
off soot free. The only thing the officials object to j
is that the ex-students did cot go the right way to I
work. This Is the right way for them to get their I
grievance redressed: A petition embodying their
complaints should have been sent to Mr. Inspector
Morris or Mr. Inspector Thompson. Either of
these gentlemen would pass the communication
on to Mr. Dlstrlot-Inspeot >r M’Oredle. It would
then be sent on to Mr. Deputy-Chlef-Inspeotor
Bridges; from him. to the Chief Inspector, Mr.
Maynard; Mr. Maynard would pass It on to Mr.
Johnson, the Under-Secretory, and be, if he
thought necessary, would submit the matter to the
Minister. Whether Doctor Renwlok will reoelve
the deputation or not remains to be seen.
The Perth (Western Australia) Inquires
says:—“ The first time that Sir Henry (then Mr.)
Wrenfordsley had aboriginal native prisoners
brought before him as Chief Justice of the colony
fer trial, he emphatically expressed his shocked
surprise at seeing the poor wretches placed in the
dock chained together like so many wild beasts.”
BEFORE AND AFTER.
“ Will you have a plate of Icecream, dear? he
asked. “ No, thank you, I never eat cream In the
winter,” she sweetly replied. “ Well, do try a dish
of thoie delicious Oysters, won't you, pet, ’ he
continued. "No, Alfred, they are so dear.” ” I
thought I was the only thing that w#s dear.” ‘ Oh,
Alfred i must go homo.” "I am fbeorry,” he saw
"Oh, pet, I know whac you want. Let me order a
bottle of that famous St. Louis L«g«r Beer?’
Her beautiful blue eyes lighted up. Just a tint of
orlmion appeared upon her ioveiy face. When
she could breath easy, she said, ** Oh, Alfred, do.’

would have been nearer this critic s capabilities

able In judging the merits of pottery. The decora-
tions of the lovely fruit-services, banqueting-

justice at such hands, and the efforts of the pro-

IT behoves every thrifty housewife to
look to the future, in order if pos-
sible to
SAVE MONEY.
It is a well-known fact that a large in-
crease has occurred in the price of wool at
home, and it is only to be expected that
prices of Woollen Goods will be higher
next winter than they are this ; so that if
any of you will be requiring
NEW BLANKETS
next winter, how much better to buy them
now, and save the inevitable increase in
price,
Those who have bought blankets from]
this winter know what excellent value we
have been giving, and we feel sure that if
you do so also you will never regret it.
OUR PRICES ARE—

“ DEMOCRAT’S ” CREDENTIALS.
Extract from Sydney Sunday News
“ In onr advertising columns will be found the
public notices of 1 Democrat’s ’ Consultations on
the Caulfield and Melbourne Cups for 1886, which
promise to be most popular undertakings on the
part of the spirited and enterprising promoter of
those wonderful ‘ fortune-making ’ lotteries. It is
not often that we have a good word to say of racing
consultations as a rule, but in ‘ Democrat’s ’ case
we can strongly recommend them to the public, as
we happen to know the moving spirit—one of the
right sort, and who is proverbial in racing circles
for honest and square dealing. One of the best
features of ‘ Democrat’s ’ consultations is the fact
of the drawing being conducted by a committee
of influential gentlemen, whose names are above
suspicion.”
Several other newspapers have borne similar
testimony to the genuineness of “Democrat’s”
consultations.
D EMOCRAT’S mammoth consultation.
MELBOURNE CUP of 1886.
7500 subscribers at £1 each.
First Horse £5OOO
Second Horse 1000
Third Horse 500
Starters divide £5OO ; Non-starters divide £5OO.
Immediate application for tickets invited, so
that lucky drawers of horses will have time to
hedge.
All “Democrat’s” consultations are drawn in,
the presence of a committee of well-known, reliable
a nd respected leading public men of Sydney.

Hardened Uver.
Five years ago I broke down with kidney and
liver complain!, and rheumatism.
Since then I have been unable to be about at all.
My liver became hard like wood ; my limbs were
puffed up and filled with water.
All the best physicians agreed that nothing
could cure me. I resolved to try Hop Bitters ; I
have used seven bottles ; the hardness has all gone
from my liver, t lie swelling from my limbs, and it
has worked a miracle in my case; otherwise I
would have been no w in my grave.
J. W. Morev, Buffalo, Oct. 1, 1881,
Poverty and Suffering
“I was dragged down with debt, poverty and suffering for
years, caused by a sick family and large bills for doctoring.
I was completely discouraged, until one year ago, by the
advice of my pastor, X commenced nging Hop Bitters, and in
one month we were all well, and none of us have seen a sick
day since, an<td want to say to all poor men, you can keep
your families well a year with Hop Bitters for less than one
doctor’s visit will cost. I know it."

If when you call for American Hop Bitters (see green twig

A WONDERFUL MEDICINE.
BEECHAM’S PILLS
Are admitted by thou-
sands to be worth a
Guinea a Box for bilious
and nervous disorders,
such as wind and pain
in the stomach, sick
headache, giddiness,
fulness and swelling
after meals, dizziness
and drowsiness, cold
chills, flushings of heat,
loss of appetite, short-
ness of breath, costive-
ness,scurvy, blotches on
the skin,disturbed sleep,
frightful dreams,and all
nervous and trembling
sensations, &c. The first
dose will give relief in
twenty minutfes. This is no fiction, for they have
done it in thousands of cases. Every sufferer is
earnestly invited to try one box of these Pills, and
they will be acknowledged to be
WORTH A GUINEA A BOX.
For females of all ages these Pills are invaluable,
as a few dos’es of them carry off all gross humours,
open all obstructions, and bring about all that is
required. No female should be without them. There
is no medicine to be found to equal BEECHAM’S
PILLS for removing any obstruction or irregularity
of the systcc-n. If taken according to the directions
given with each box they will soon restore females of
all ages to seund and robust health.
For a weak stomach, impaired digestion and all
disorders of the liver, they act like “ MAGIC,” and a
few doses will he found to work wonders upon the
most important organs of the human machine. They
strengthen the whole muscular system, restore the
long-lost complexion, bring back the) keen edge of
appetite, and arouse into action with the ROSEBUD
of health the whole physical energy of the human
frame. These are “ FACTS ” admitted by thousands
embracing all classes of society; and one of the
best guarantees to the nervous and debilitated is,
Beecham’s Pills have the largest sale of any patent
medicine in the world.
BEECHAM’S MAGIC COUGH PILLS.
As a remedy for Coughs- in general, Asthma, Diffi-
culty in Breathing, Shortness of Breath, Tightness

any of the above complaints need only try One Box
to prove that they are the best ever offered to the
public for Asthmatic and Consumptive Coughs,
Hoarseness, and Oppression of the Chest. They
speedily reprove that sense, of oppression and difficulty
of breathing which nightly deprive the patient of rest.
They give almost instant relief and comfort to those
afflicted with the above distressing and, when neg-
lected, dangerous complaints. Let any person troubled
with any of the above complaints give Beecham’s
Cough Pills a trial.
• The most violent Cough will in a short time he

The Redfern Bicycle Club brought off
their first annual meeting on Siturday, oa the
Association Cricket Ground, in the presence of a
moderate attendance. H. H. Lambton, the much-
imnroved Burwood man, made a win of the slowly-
ridden live-miles Invitation scratch race, although
he nearly lost It through losing bis pedals in the
final spurt, and he only lust recovered himself in
time to beat Brown, of Victoria. The mile tricycle
championship soon resolve! Itself Into a match
between E. W. Quirk and J. F. Rugs'. the former
winning rather easily in 3min. F. J.
Biohler (80yds) won the mile maiden bicycle
handicap; Salway (80 yds) won the mile open
handicap; Ballird nroved himself the mile cham-
pion of the club; Vonnard showed himself ihe
best schoolboy at a mile; and 4. Kinnlnmont won
the three miles open handicap from Thomas.
Kinnlnmont must be a glutton for work, as he
had previously won two heats in the mile maiden
and a like number in the open mile.

A big muster of Cook’s River lads put in
an appearance at Foley’s lull on Wednesday night
when the much-talfced-of glove fight between
Sparkes and Wilkie was brought off. Suffice to
say the men were tbe worst bands at the game It
has ever been our misfortune to witness, and
Wilkie gave in after five rounds of fighting that a
schoolboy would have laughed at. Sparkes comes
of good stock, being a son and nephew of Tom and
Bill Sparkes respectively—both of whom, by the
way, were In the hall—but he is scarcely a chip of
the old block, who fought such a gallant battle
with Nat Langbam, Tom Sayers’ only Victor. On
May 4, 1847, Bill Sparkes ana the celebrated Eng-
lish middleweight. Nat Langbam met at Woking,
England, and bad Sparkes not had the small bones
in hla right arm br ken In the 67th round, the
fight might have had a very different termination
The fighting was of lightning rapidity, no lest
than 67 rounds being fought In 63 minutes. In
tbe second round Sparkes knocked Lang ham clean
off his feet with a right-handed spank in the ribs,
and he repeated tbe performance in the Bth, 13th.
38th, and 50th rounds. It was in the 62nd round
that Sparkts had the arm broken, but It was not
till tbe 67th that bis second threw up the sponge,
and even then muoh against Sparkes’ will.
For right down slogging matches, Satur-
day night at Foley's equalled anything yet seen
at that popular School of Arts. The opening bout
between Gorman and Burgess was worth the
money in itaelf. Both men gluttons at taking
punishment, they stood up to their work, and at
the end of four ding-dong rounds they oould not
be divided Tom lav lor, Jackson’s pupil, faced
the scientific Peter Newton, and made a better
show than wo expected of him. Favours were
very equally distributed until the third round,
when Taylor went weak, and had Newton followed
up the Jacksonian, it looked all over with him.
In tne fourth round, Taylor came again, and
when the men were ordered to “ shake bands,”
there was nothing to choose between them.
Taylor is a fine powerful young fellow, and shapes
like a tradesman, but tne bigh action of his left
arm when sparring, something after the style of a
high-stepping carriage horse, will, without doubt,
prove tiring when he is called upon to make a
prolonged effort. Perhaps the best box of the
night was between Murphy and Stewart. To look
at tbe men it looked a whiteman to a Chinaman
on the clean-built Stewart, who has thrashed
everyone yet opposed to him in the field. So
soon as time was called for the final round,
slim-looking Murphy, weighing but Bst. 51b.,
landed four blows such as few 12at. men oould
deliver, and knocked his opponent “ groggy,” but
Stewart stuck to his man, and when time was
called both were tired, with Murphy a bit the best
of it. Tbe champion Foley, as usual, showed him-
self a master of the art in his bout with the clever
Victorian Molloy. Lees found a chopping-block
in novice somebody or other, and Steve O’Donnell
and Meadows went through five rounds of what
would not have brushed the powder off a lady’s
cheek.

Sydney Rowing Club regatta afternoons
are proverbial for their windy character, and at
noon last Saturday it looked as if the usual rule
would obtain. But after luncheon the wind
moderated, and the S.R.O. people experienced
the novelty of calm water for their races at
the Branch. H. H. Massie (" The Deer ”of the
cricket field), C. A. Gadeo, J. E. H. Kennedy,
and G. A. Bros made an easy win of the senior
fours; W. H. Stuart made ditto of tbe maiden
sculls; and trial and scratch sights filled In a
good aquatic afternoon.

In their second match, Neil Matterson
made as great a show ot Perkins as the Englishman
had made of him at their first meeting. Some ex-
planation of the reversal of form may be found in
letters from home, whieh state that on the day
when Matterson was defeated, he pulled a boat
weighing fully 371b5.. the work la which was
lowered on the day of the race. Beach’s “ grip ”
of tbe water and command over big boat may be
attributed in a great measure to the manner he is
perched up in his craft, and should the report be
true that young Matterson was at the last moment
squatted down in his boat, a further cause of
defeat seed not be looked for. Gaudaur, who is
now in England, is stated to be a finished sculler,
in great contrast to Teemer, who, if one paper at
least can be depended on, is a sculler of the main
strength and brutality sort.

A certain English jockey, who favoured
these shores with a visit last year, appears to have
come over very much “on the make.” There
was a lot of talk shout his starting an extensive
training establishment and so forth, but it would
seem that nobody ever saw “ the colour of his
money ” from tne day of bis landing till that of
his hurried departure. Furniture, food, saddlery,
drinks, clothes, ana ci» ars-all were procured on
thi “ never ” system. The departed one must have
been wortb a nice bit of money at one time, and as a
jockey stands—or stood-high in bis profession.
Evidently, though things have gone amiss with
him in England, and he tried Australia on the “ off
chance ”of striking oil. His want of success la
much deplored by several creditors.

After being 41 knocked out’ ’in the Melbourne
Cup betting, Trenton has be come again as good
a favourite as anything. Lots of things will
happen between now and November, hut all going
well with him in the meantime, the N.Z. horse will
take a lot of beating lor the big event. That
Trenton was unlucky In being bealeu last year his
i übfcequent performances proved. If he were
matched against Sheet Anchor to-day over the
same course and at the same weights, good judges
- ■ -
would lay 3 to 1 on him reversing last year’s run-
ning. Misguided mortals who win speculate might
do worse than to take a fancy bet about the next
Melbourne Cup falling to a son of Musket.

The tardy settlement of that cricketing
squabble between the Melbourne Club and Messrs.
Shaw and Shrewsbury, has given general satis-
faction. By abandoning a grab-ail policy the
M.C.C. Is not likely to be muoh out of pocket In
the end, for the terms arranged with Shaw’s agent
are that all Melbourne matches must be played on
the M.C.C ground, the Club taking 25 per cent, of
tne grand-stand receipts, and 10 per cent, of the
gate money. Under favourable weather conditions
these receipts are likely to be considerable. Tbe
professionals* team should prove a muoh surer
draw than any which the Club could have Im-
ported, as it will include the backbone of the “ All
England ” Eleven which has won back those his-
toric “ashes.” The prejudice which existed
against gate-money enterprises has been consider-
ably weakened by recent cricket developments.
Murd®oh’s crowd of 1884, who played for the r own
pockets, made a vastly uetter she w than the present
Eleven, which is merely upnoldlog the “ honour ”
of Australia and the Interests of the Melbourne
Club. And of the English teams visiting Australia
none left with such a good record as the Staaw-
Shrewsbury combination. They worked for the
“gate,” and they did it uncommonly well. With
the one exception of Ulyett, they showed a
sitUl and determination in the field quite un-
precedented among English professionals, and
the fact that the forthcoming lot will be
under the same management is a guarantee
for all-round efficiency. If the .“amateurs”
Shrewsbury brings with him were superior
creatures of tbe Lord Harris pattern, things might
not work always smoothly. But tbe Nottingham
man understands his business. The “amateurs”
he engaged will be either in the swim themselves
or—granting their claim to tbe title—gentlemen
who will conscientiously study the interests of.tbe
business. There promises, however, to be too
muoh hippodrome about the next season’s
arrangements. The * Australian Eleven,” it
seems, is to be hired out by the Melbourne Club, and
will meet the Englishmen in each big town At
that rate, the towns will have to keep scoring
game and game, and then playing off the rubber,
or else the weaker side must get beaten with
wearisome monotony. Neither alternative looks
pleasant from a sporting point of view. The
Fubllo get disgusted with a “ you throw me and
’ll throw you*’ programme, nor will they roll up
to see one lot invariably beaten. And the present
Australian Eleven doesn't look like Invariably
winning. It is impossible to blink the faot. If the
Melbourne Club is bent on farming the Eleven,
they will do well to irrigate it with a little fresh
blood.

Here are some interesting figures from the
last England v. Australia match. The following
seven men made an aggregate score of 22 runs in
the first innings and 30 runs in the second innings;
—Jones, Soott, M‘ll wraith, Blaokham, Garrett,
Evans, Spofforth; 52 runs for 14 innings—average
soore per man, 3 5-7 runs. Of the Australian
bowlers, Spofforth took 4 wickets for 65, and
Trumble 3 wickets for 80. The remaining 3 English
wiokets cost 279 runs, against the bowling of
Palmer, Evans, Garrett, Jones, Giffen, and Bruoe.
As the ground is represented as being very heavy
on the two last days, it Is a remarkable faot that
only 1 English wicket (Sootton was out on the first
day) and 3 Australian wiokets were clean bowled.
Lohman and Briggs secured 18 wiokets between
them, at an average cost of 9 runs. Both these
men have been engaged for Shaw’s Eleven,
together with Barlow, who accomplished a best-
on-reoord against the Australians in the first of
the test matches at Manchester. On turf in splen-
did condition he toek 8 wiokets for 63 runs, caught
3 other men, and played innings of 38 (not out) and
30. By the way, as Spofforth was Interviewed by
the Fall Mall Gazette, perhaps someone will
interview Lehman and Barlow about the “ secret”
of their trundling. We notice that Briggs, who
bowled with such uniform success at Lord's and
the Oval, was never tried at all in the Manchester
match.

•The grand aquatic puzzle is intensified by
Nell Matterson’s easy defeat of Perkins for the
“ championship of England.” At a first glance
it looks as though Matterson may be just rowing

By cable we leara that colonial sculler

prove.
The results of last Saturday’s Sydney foot-
ball matches did not materially alter the position
of any of the Gardiner Cup competitors, as the
clubs well to the fore scored fresh wins. While on
the subject of the Gardiner Cup, we would suggest
to the Union tbe desirableness of altering the
rules under which tbe trophy is competed for, for
although they acted very well while only
some six or seven olubs were on the list,
they are not suitable under the circumstances
of the largely-increased number of senior
clubs. The first rule says the club winning
most matches during the season shall be declared
the winner, and, as the respective olubs arrange
their own lists, it is an incentive for them to oram
as many and as “ soft ” matches into tneir pro-
grammes as possible. One club, A, may
arrange,say 15 matches, 11 “soft” things which
they win, and the remaining four against the
cracks, which they lose. Another club, B, may
arrange 11 matches end win 10. Including a couple
of contests against A, but as A have won the most
matches they are deemed the winners. Such rules
are absurd and require revision.

Amongst the relies of the good old days
of the colonial P.R. now on view at Foley’s flstlo
academy, Is the champion-belt of N.S.W., pre-
sented to Ike Reid, 39 years ago, in recognition of
the scientific way In which he knocked the
“seasoning” out of George Hough, at Middle
Harbour, April 6, ’47. The belt Is a work of art in
Its way, ana was manufactured by J. J. Cohen.
The “mill”la question w?s a rattler, 87 rounds
being fought In Ih. 38mir\ In those days Hough
was a man of might, having, amongst other
“brushes.” knocked Bliley, who was a good’un,
out in 1843, at George’s Kiver, in eight rounds, and
subsequently “dressed” Ned Cbaiker down for
£2OO and the championship, in a fast fought 43
rounds, in 1846. It is not generally known, even
amongst the talent, that the veteran Hough Is at
present residing with Mr. A. Turnbull, Emu
Plains, Penrith, and with the exception of having
partially lest his sight, appears to be as bale and
hearty as he was when he pitched his “ castor
on the grasiy sward, and put up hts “ dukes
nearly half a century ago, to the best men who
oould be brought before him.

GLIMPSES OF THE STAGE.
Under this heading a writer In a recent number
of the Whitehall Review gives a pleasantly
readable account of a visit behind the scenes or a
theatre in London, at which Mr. Wilson Barrett
and Miss Eastlake are now delighting large! audi-
ences with Greek tragedy, as “ Clito’ Mr. Bar-
rett had received an ugly stab In hi: left arm dur-
ing the performance of ono of the terribly realis-
tic scenes in the tragedy, and Miss Eastlake, who
hrs covered herself with glory for her terrioie
creation of “ Guile,” was, at the same time, only
just recovering from a painful acoldent In tne
sbspoof a recently sprained foot. As an incident
of the visit, both these artists were loud in their
praises of what the lady called “a newly-dis-
oovered cure, a sort of charm,” and it Is needless
to say that this was none other than the world-
renowned fit Jacob’s oil. Neither of them could
say enough in praise c f the great pain conqueror,
and the writer of the article (which is contained
in the Review of Jut e 17 1881, but is too long for
publication) winds up by saying:—
“ In eonoludiag'thls article I will diverge for a
moment and say that, wbl e it Is neither my incli-
nation nor business to proclaim my opinion re-
specting the merits of a mediomtl discovery, the
proprietors of Bt. Jacobs Oil are certainly welcome
to every benefit the publicity of the above state-
ment of facts nay I ring to them. Wherever one
goes he learns almost dally how the marvellous
powers of this wonderful nil are becoming recog-
nised by all classes. Meeting a prominent physi-
cian the other day, whoso wife had for two years
been a perfect martyr to rheumatism, I was told
that Its magical curative properties had fairly
mystified him. After only using this remedy one
week, every trace of tho terrible pains from which
she so long suffered left her, and had never re-
turned. I notice, also, that the champion oarsman
of the word, William Beach, of Australia, is
among the many notables who publicly endorse is
as a really wonderful discovery."
