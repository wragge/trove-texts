Lysaght Colorbond provides
manufacturers with a new concept
in steel sheet and coil. Paint first.
Fabricate later.
Colorbond is a premium quality,
factory applied coating onto cold
rolled or zinc coated sheet steel.
No conventional spray or dip process
could ever match its uniformity and
finish at a lower cost. Paint and
labour costs alone could be greater.
Colorbond is versatile. It can be deep
drawn, roll formed, stamped, press
braked or hot stamped. The result,
a more attractive product at a lower
cost. A great idea. Use Colorbond
to supplement your own finishing
facilities. Or to raise out-put without
further capital outlay. Colorbond
can save dollars all down the line.

REVISED VERSION
THE MELBOURNE “HERALD”
recently published a piece, “Pope Paul
the Man.” In its first edition it
described the author as “famous St.
Kilda-born author Morris West” and
in its second edition as “Australian
author Morris West.” Perhaps the
“Herald” doesn’t support the St. Kilda
football team.
WHAT IS "TRUTH?"
WITH a sidelong glance at topical
events which is about as subtle as a
banner headline, the Paramount Pictures
people in Queensland have retrieved
Cecil B. de Mille’s production of “The
Ten Commandments” from the vaults
for a “mammoth, State-wide splash re-
lease.”
Just in case any picturegoer misses the
point, Brisbane “Truth” last week ran a
supplementary story which began: “Re-
ligion has become front-page news in a
world shaken by controversy inside and
outside the churches. But in a world
accused of cynicism and lack of faith
the Bible is still a best-seller, and bibli-
cal films remain as popular as they were
half a century ago.” Maybe. But
Catholics revisiting de Mille’s nine-
yen r-old epic are not likely to learn any-
thing they don’t already know from
Charlton Heston’s Moses.
SIGNIFICANT MOMENTS
AUGUST is Exhibition time in Bris-
bane. It is also the time when people
converge on the Queensland capital.
Hobart and Canberra may be fine in
February, Armidale and Melbourne
might be sufferable in May, but in
August only Brisbane offers any hope
of comfort or warmth.
This vacation more than 2000 people
are at the Queensland University for
conferences, including the National
Identity one which Denis O’Brien
writes about on page 33. However, the
opening sessions of the Society of
Authors’ first Queensland professional-
writing seminar drew fewer than three
dozen people.
The sparseness of his audience could
have been what set novelist Thomas
Keneally talking of the lonely business
of writing. Certainly the message came
through clearly that writing is a lonely,
lonely thing. “You’ve got to sit down
on your own and do it (write). It’s
no use moving in literary circles and
thinking that creation is round the
comer. Writing’s a lonely business . . .
a monstrous life,” he said.
And it’s risky, too. Eager note-takers,
there to learn the magic “how-to” from
the winner of two Commonwealth
Literary Fund Grants, were told that
“the most dreadful thing of all is when
someone gives you a little time.” Accord-
ing to Keneally, sitting down to write
becomes even more risky when you’re
being paid to do it. What if you never
write anything new? What if you fail
and waste the taxpayers’ money?
Defining the short story as “a signi-
ficant moment,” Queensland short-story
writer Bill Scott quoted David Forrest
on “split-level culture” in connection
with this writing form. In the final
analysis the choice for the short-story
writer appeared either to be “lowbrow”
in the boy-meets-girl, boy-loses-girl, boy-
gets-girl pattern and sell by studying
the market or to stick to the limited
market of “upper level” stories and
rely (apart from hiring an agent) on
“the impetus of sheer genius” to force
your work before editorial notice.
Scott, who greatly admires William
Saroyan—“the voice of America in the
’thirties,” said that Saroyan really be-
came famous as a writer after he was
punched on the nose by James Mason.
Definitely a significant moment.
THE LONG VIEW
CATHOLIC HISTORIAN Patrick
O’Farrell has the advantage of the long
view in evaluating the current crisis
in his Church.
From his research for his just-
published book, “The Catholic Church
in Australia,” he says the Church
weathered a far tougher time in this
country during the 1850s.
“It boiled up because the laity
wanted to share in the authority,
basically what today’s issue’s about —
but in 1857 the radicals really created
a song and dance. They accused the
Vicar-General of being mad and the
Archbishop of being doddering. The
Archbishop reacted by threatening them
with excommunication — and very
grudgingly they gave in.
Dr. O’Farrell, senior lecturer in
history at the University of New
South Wales, researched his book for
four years, although it’s a by-product
of a larger study he’s tackling on Irish
influences in Australia. That, he says,
is a 10-year project.
“I decided to do the book on
Catholicism because there was a crying
Dr. Patrick O’Farrell ...objective
need for it. There’s so much plain
ignorance, pious rubbish, and blindness
as well about it. I think this book is
the first attempt made to settle the
contradictions. I’ve tried to give the
picture of the Church as it is — not
to make judgments. Many people here
see the Church’s facade — issues like
the DLP, Mannix and conscription,
and the Pill — and I've included chap-
ters on those. But I’ve tried to get
inside, too, because the fact is that the
business of the Church is to save souls,
not to set up schools.”
Dr. O’Farrell says Australia’s group
of liberal Catholics is small but strong
— you can discern a sort of liberal
syndrome. If someone has one view on
the education system, you can predict
their opinions across the whole spec-
trum.
“The unfortunate thing is that there’s
a tendency toward polarisation — you
get pigeonholed into two opposing
camps, labelled either a reactionary or
a liberal. I’ve been called a liberal
among the reactionaries and a reaction-
ary among the liberals. And often the
two groups can’t talk to one another.
They ought to be big enough and Chris-

tian enough to include a wide range
of opinion.
“Since the 19505, extremism has
become marked, and it leads to bitter
disputes and antagonisms.”
In pursuing his research, Dr. O’Farrell
has had to plunge into a seemingly
endless mass of material. He began in
Ireland, where he spent a year teaching
at University College, Dublin. The
Church was co-operative, except that
the Archbishop, in disapproval of the
way an American historian had used
the records, had placed a ban on docu-
ments before 1866.
In Rome, predictably, information
was copious, but some of it, the collec-
tion housed in Propaganda College,
was in Latin and in Italian. “My Latin
is so-so, but my Italian doesn’t go
beyond ‘prego,’ so I only used Irish
College. But probably it was 'better,
because the stuff there is more informal
and gives more of an insight into what
people were like.”
Dr. O’Farrell says the Australian
hierarchy has fallen under three separ-
ate influences: the English Benedictine
influence, weakened by Irish-based
authority, which in turn disappeared
by the 19405. The Church, he feels, has
now become Australianised with strong
Roman links. Any rebellion among the
Australian hierarchy against the Pope’s
encyclical on birth control would have
been highly unlikely. Doubt about papal
infallibility has never been a character-
istic of the hierarchy in this country.
In treating the ALP-DLP split, Dr.
O’Farrell has aimed at objectivity, so it
will be interesting to see if he provokes
objective reactions.
Dr. O’Farrell makes no overt judg-
ments in his book about the Church’s
place in or out of politics, but he
believes his feelings are probably
implicitly stated. “The Church is con-
cerned with the whole of people’s
lives, so ought to be involved in every-
thing including politics. But as for
priests taking an active role in politics,
I think they should be involved in their
priestly business, not politics for the
sake of politics.”
If history does • repeat itself, the
lesson of the 1850s’ crisis in the
Church, as outlined in Dr. O’Farrell’s
book, is a grim one for liberal Catholics.
The outcome of that rebellion was the
dawn of a time of more stringent
authority.
MONUMENT
ADAMS’ MARBLE BAR incorporated
in a $ 10-million, 40-storey commercial
and residential complex on the site of
the old hotel in Pitt Street, Sydney, is
probably not exactly what the National
Trust of New South Wales had in
mind when it put the bar in “A” class,
must be preserved, recently, but it is
better than nothing.
Stocks and Holdings announced de-
tails of their Adams Hotel-Palace
Theatre redevelopment last week. The
project, which should get under way
next year, will be carried out in co-
operation with Lanray Industries’ re-
building of the adjacent Royal Arcade,
which should start taking shape by the
middle of next year.
The Adams site plans, soon to be
submitted to the City Commissioners,
show the demolition of the Palace
Theatre, which throughout its 72 years
has served as a theatre-cum-cinema and
at present is housing the Noel Coward
Festival plays. Although by today’s
standards it is not ideal as a theatre,
its disappearance will not only deprive
Sydney of a stage but also a unique
piece of architecture which includes
two intriguing chimney stacks, the
► remnants of the city’s first independent
power station built to provide electricity
for both the theatre and the adjoining
hotel.
However, the ornate Adams’ Marble
Bar, with its masses of marbles and
stained glass and its Julian Ashton
murals, will rise again on the first of
two floors of shopping arcades in the
new building. To be called Marble
Bar Tavern, “it will probably be
featured among some other type of
activity, but will certainly be more than
just a monument,” Mr. Mclnnes, of
Lanray, said. The cost of dismantling,
storing, and re-erecting it after recon-
struction of the site was calculated by
Stocks and Holdings’ managing direc-
tor, Mr. Erwin Graf, at “tens of
thousands of dollars” a lot of money
compared with the reported $40,000
total it cost Mr. George Adams when
he threw caution to the winds during
Australia’s post - gold - boom financial
slump to add it to his already-popular
hotel in 1893.

WE HAVE just survived another Edu-
cation Week. Schools everywhere were
open for inspection and even Barry
Humphries returned to his old Alma
Mater. He was photographed in the
school cap and reported as saying: “It
is indeed a daunting experience to
return to these hallowed precincts. I am
glad to say they are no less hideous
than they ever were.” And turning to
the Headmaster, Mr. Hone, he asked:
“Are they allowed to smoke now? No?
When I was at school we were not
allowed, either. I just used to knock on
the master’s common-room door and,
when it opened, breathe in quickly.”
Humphries was not a happy schoolboy,
but the mystic atmosphere of the old
place, combined with the aroma of pies,
sandshoes, chalk, and ink, cast its spell
and he said: “I am glad to see that the

down so the people could have a clearer
view of the Shrine.”
Yet, apart from tours by Ministers
and distinguished old boys, this has also
been a time for publishing books, and
the most fascinating book on education
for many a day came on the market,
“Our Troubled Schools,” by John
McLaren, published by F. W. Cheshire.
John McLaren lectures in English at
Melbourne’s Secondary Teacher College
and he is education writer for “The
Australian.” The book has much on
modem systems and aims of education,
but the section which interested your
correspondent was about the old agony
which worries us all, where do you send
your child to school? do you send
him to the State school down the road,
or do you impoverish yourself keeping
him at one of the snob public schools?
McLaren himself describes it as the
intolerable dilemma. He says parents
“may not believe in the principle of
being able to buy a superior education,
but by sending their child to a State
school they condemn him willy-nilly to
at least the possibility of an inferior
education. On the other hand, should
they decide to pay the fees for an inde-
pendent school, they are not only risking
their child becoming tarred with the
worst of brushes, but they are also help-
ing to perpetuate a pernicious system.”
There’s no question, public schools in
Melbourne still have their snob value.
A young man with brilliant qualifica-
tions and nice manners may get the
job that is offered. But, if all is equal,
the public-school boy’s chances would
be better.
The reason for this is obvious
ex-public-school boys still have a grip
on so many top jobs, still have a grip
on the membership of all the top clubs.
McLaren even describes the pecking
system: the student whose parents can
afford public-school education looks
down on those who go only to the
smaller independent schools, and these
“Mind you, the old school tie still
helps!”
look down on the better high schools,
whose students look down on those
attending ordinary high schools, who in
turn look down on the unfortunate ones
attending poorer high schools in beaten-
up or run-down areas, who are still able
to scorn those at the very bottom of the
ladder, the junior technical school
students.
All this varies a little from State to
State. McLaren finds that the atmos-
phere of the greater public schools in
Sydney is every bit as dignified and
stuffy as the associated public schools
of Melbourne, but they don’t enjoy the
same social prestige as ours. Many New
South Wales businessmen and politicians
have come from high schools and are
content to send their children to the
same institutions. Yet, in Victoria, even
successful Labor politicians send their
children to the public schools.
And, he says, in Sydney the public
schools have deigned to let the senior
high schools into their ranks, but not so
in Melbourne. He gives this quick run-
down. For the landed aristocracy,
Geelong Grammar, “which has never
claimed academic distinction, and King’s
School, Sydney, remain the ultimate,
with Oxford and Cambridge a more
fitting locale for tertiary education than
one of Australia’s provincial redbricks.
Victoria’s Scotch College and Melbourne
Boys’ Grammar are the meccas for the
commercial and professional elite, while
St. Peter’s, in Adelaide, confers the
special accolade of the South Australian
establishment.”
McLaren never quite gives the
answer to the intolerable dilemma. He
makes it very clear that he believes
the independent schools take the cream
of the best teachers, that if you want
a good classical education or a good
science education for your child, your
chances are far better at a public school.
There the playing fields are broad,
the science laboratories are good, and,
except for the select elite of high
schools, the pass rates are far superior.
Most of the gentlemen with brass plates
in Collins Street are ex-public school.
But at the same time he never hides
his contempt for these establishments.
He says they were fashioned on the
antique model of Dr. Arnold’s Rugby
and have never changed much. Here
are some splendid quotes on public
schools:
“Beneath their varied and progres-
sive surfaces, the independent schools
remain depressingly uniform and con-
formist ... we find in them no
experiments with true collegiate con-
trol, or with community integration.”
“At the head of the hierarchy the
principal combines the attributes of
European god-professor, English milord,
and American tycoon, while somewhere
on the fringes a chaplain operates the
spiritual dispensary, which, like the
best metropolitan hotels, combines the
most elegant traditionalism with the
slickest of service.”
Public-school “loyalty can be relied
upon to open cheque books during
building appeals and office doors when-

On television McLaren went further:
he suggested the way to make the
public schools more human, more of
a reflection of the community, would
be to turn them into co-educational
institutions.
So far the idea has not caused any
profound reaction. Perhaps even Barry
Humphries would be startled at the
sight of girls in Melbourne Grammar
caps.
OUT AND ABOUT

HIS EXCELLENCY

ON HIS OWN
MABEL, the St. John Ambulance nurse,
is in two minds whether she should be
here at all. They said to come to the
East Wing of Government House,
Sydney, for the Australian Medical
Association garden party, and here she
stands. In a fizzing draught, miles from
anywhere, with a stretcher, two screens,
a waterjug and bowl, and her own
personal first-aid kit. She’ll have to ask
John who’s in charge when he turns up.
Meanwhile, Mabel is asking passers-by
if it’s the toy-lets they want, then?
Actually, no. These eminent medical
gentlemen and their wives, here for the
Third Medical Congress, are seeking a
glimpse of the swimming-pool in which
His Excellency, the Governor of New
South Wales, disports himself. Because
if it is the toy-lets, persists Mabel,
they’re there. And waves a white-cotton-
gloved hand toward two hand-painted
notices nailed to Sir Roden Cutler’s
trees, which say MEN: HOMMES.
LADIES: FEMMES. Major James
Henningham, one of half a dozen hon-
orary ADCs detailed to answer any
question the 1000 guests care to put, says
he thinks it’s in French because, well,
dammit, the Congress is international,
isn’t it?
It is 2.15 p.m. i Guests are parking
cars on Sir Roden’s lawn and handing
entree cards to police at the gate, with-
out which positively no admittance is
given. The form is to either sit and
listen to the N.S.W. Police Pipe Band
playing traditional folksy airs, or wander
around the garden inspecting Sir
Roden’s wildlife and get acquainted
with other guests. For this purpose,
everyone wears large identity labels
pinned bosom-high, and instant chest
inspection sets in. So round the flowers
and shrubs, back past Sir Roden’s tennis
court . . . “It’s a bloody jungle,”* says a
doctor’s wife, referring to foreign parts
. . . “Guts everywhere,” says a doctor,
“otherwise the picnic was a great suc-
cess” ... “I say, did you know, Flo’s
gone into nursing?” Ecstatic news.
Everyone is busy photographing every-
one else in their garden-party clothes,
which are rapidly, as the temperature
lowers, becoming unsuitable. Except for
Mrs. Leon Carp, from Melbourne, who’s
rugged up for outer space in screaming
turquoise and shocking-pink with sort
of matching goggles, hat, and cling-cling
leather zip-up boots. Dr. Carp looks
kinda embarrassed by the whole outfit.
And at exactly 3 p.m. a command
trickles through the loudspeaker that
tea is now being served in the tents,
where Norma, who’s been slaving over
the food since 9 a.m., prays the 125
dozen scones, 150 dozen petits four,
1201 b. assorted biscuits, and all those
85 loaves cut into wedgy sandwiches
will be demolished.
What everyone hopes for is the
appearance of Dr. Christiaan Barnard.
Doubtful, really, after that journey
from Rome and Sophia Loren. What
no one knows is that at this very
moment Dr. Barnard is inside Govern-
ment House taking tea with Sir Roden,
Mr. Askin, Premier of N.S.W., and
others. His appearance on the dais for
God Save the Queen is, therefore,
nothing short of dramatic. “Now they’ll
mingle,” says Major Henningham. They
have to. The only tent free for private
conversations, which Sir Roden usually
prefers, is full of rope.
Out they come and Dr. Barnard,
smiling like a toothpaste ad and wear-
ing a brown-and-mustard-striped suit,
has the doctors’ wives swooning in
seconds. Actually, says John Otter, de-
tailed from Canberra to watch over
Barnard, actually, he’s jolly good at
this sort of thing. And he’s never bored
answering the same old questions which
are: (1) how did he find Sophia Loren,
(2) what’s all this about mortality, and
(3) please expand on baboon hearts.
In that order. So Dr. Barnard is say-
ing for the umpteenth time that Sophia
is beautiful and intelligent, and so, by
the way, is Princess Grace, and Premier
Askin rushes off to repeat it to the
Press. There’s a little par for you, he
tells them, should make a few lines.
And the crowds round Barnard grow
bigger and Sir Roden mingles quietly
on his own in the background, and
everyone says isn’t it marvellous, we’ve
met him. How does he stay so fresh?
Well, he’s a good sleeper and never
takes pills. A girl shakes his hand. It is,
she reports, hot. Mr. Askin turns his
best profile to camera. OK, boys,
shoot. “. . . and then,” says Major
Henningham, “VIPs will go in for a
drink and the whole thing will wrap
up at 4.15 p.m.”
It rains before then. There is a rush
to the tea tents. “I tell you what,” says
Norma, “the food’s shifting.” “I tell
you what,” says the pipe-major to a
girl, “if you’ve gotta request we’ll play
it.” “I tell you what,” says Mabel,
who has left the East and shuffled
South, “I’m cold.” The “Last Donegal”
plays out. And Mabel says she was in
the right place. Good thing, too. With-
out her help they’d have missed the
toy-lets.

WHY MUST BUDGETS BE SECRET?
Comment by ‘Observer’
ONE BIT of the British tradition we
would be better off without is all the
nonsense and flapdoodle of Budget
secrecy. We do not make quite such a
drama of it as the British. At least we
are spared details about what our
Treasurer has to drink while he makes
his Budget speech; but we have the
same old baloney in which the nation’s
economic policies are huddled together
in secret as if they were none of our
business, and then revealed to us in
one gulp when it is too late to do any-
thing about it, apart from the rituals
of parliamentary debate.
As with other parts of our British
tradition, we do not fully realise how
odd our Budget procedures are. It is
the normal practice for the kind of
matters that a Budget is concerned
with to receive considerable public dis-
cussion for some time before they are
settled. In America they hang around
Congress for months of public debate;
in France all kinds of business institu-
tions are brought into a general public
discussion on the details of economic
planning; in Sweden the whole com-
munity is invited to participate in the
debate on what Government policies
should be.
Consider what our kind of Budgets
are supposed to do. They have three
main functions. One is the Govern-
ment’s own housekeeping: how much
money each of the departments will
spend, and what it will spend it on.
The second is the question of what
money is dished out into the com-
munity in the form of social-service
benefits, or as subsidies for various
kinds of activities (from fertilisers for
farmers to grants for writers). The
third is the use of the Budget as an
instrument of overall economic policy,
affecting the level of demand, and so
forth.
How much of the discussion on these
matters has to be secret? For that
matter, why do these matters have to
be lumped together in this arbitrary
way?
More public debates on the Govern-
ment’s own housekeeping (by parlia-
mentary committees, perhaps, certainly
by a great deal more documentation)
would almost certainly bring to light
the antique, inefficient, and sometimes
quite senseless methods by which it is at
present carried out. We don’t yet seem
to have emerged from the argy-bargy,
bluff and counter-bluff stage of
government budgeting. Departments
put in for more than they hope to get
and then fight it out in a context of
non-meaning, as if cost-benefit analysis
had never been thought of and the
possibility of exercising intelligence did
not exist. The most disgraceful example
of this was the panic ordering of
military equipment when the Govern-
ment decided to increase the proportion
of the GNP to be spent on defence.
Bits and pieces of this and that were
bought with the thoughtlessness of a
lottery winner on a spending spree:
decisions were not made within a con-
text of any policy, with the result that
the Air Force and Navy that are now
emerging from this senselessness are
incoherent, so that there must be some
years more of trying just to put them
together properly in relation to what
has been already bought, irrespective
of whether what emerges will be related
to policy. (In any case, we haven’t yet
got a policy.) But, beyond muddles
within the spending of particular de-
partments, allocation as between depart-
ments will also remain unintelligent
until the Government learns to declare
its policies and priorities, so that
rational decision can then be made
between alternative ways of achieving
policy.
So far as the dishing-out of the
Budget goes, isn’t it time that we
divorced both the social services and
activity-subsidising from the Budget
altogether? Instead of making social
services dependent on political decision,
in the British way, we could turn them
into self-adjusting national insurance
systems, in the Continental European
way. Why on earth can’t we just pinch
the Swedish system which seems to
be the best of them amend it where
necessary, and install it in Australia?
And since the enormous mess of our
activity-subsidising is now very largely
carried on outside the Budget (by the
Arbitration Commission, the Tariff
Board, the Premiers’ Conference, and
in other ways), why not chuck out this
side of the Budget altogether and try
to get a bit more coherence by unifying
areas of decision. Couldn’t we have an
education policy, an agricultural policy,
an industrial policy, and so forth, so
that sustained intelligence could be
applied to using money to implement
these policies and to establishing pri-
orities between them?
Even the use of the Budget as an
economic instrument can be overdone.
Although, from this point of view, if
stability is the test, the Treasury has
done a good job since the mess-up at
the beginning of the decade, it is never-
theless obvious that things can go wrong
with the kind of corrections to internal
demand, or to the external balance of
payments that are made by Budgets—
because Budgets guess about the future
on necessarily insufficient evidence.
They can sometimes deflate a deflation
or inflate an inflation (this has hap-
pened regularly in Britain) because
guesses were wrong. A greater readiness
for running repairs seems a good idea.
It would also seem a good idea if more
were known in detail about the
economy.
OUT OF UNITY, DIVISION
Comment by Alan Reid
BOTH IN itself and as a symbol of
anti-Communism, defence has been a
unifying influence upon the Liberal-
Country Party Government in Can-
berra in the past 20 years of its exis-
tence. But at the moment defence is
dividing the Government’s ranks, and
could divide them further.
For 20 years the Government has
operated in glorious certainty. The
southward thrust of Communist China
required Australia to take defence
measures. The Labor Opposition would
not take the same measures; it even
seemed ready to undermine the Aus-
tralian-United States alliance, the key-
stone to Australia’s defence thinking.
Consequently, the Government had to
maintain unity to prevent Labor win-
ning office and wrecking the Australian
defence structure.
The advent of John Gorton as Prime
Minister and changed international
events have eroded this glorious cer-
tainty. Mr. Gorton can see no direct
threat to Australia within the next ten
to 15 years. Should these ten or 15
years be used to build up Australia’s
development, so that if a threat emerges
after that time Australia would be in a
far better position to mount a defence
effort than it would be if it divided its
resources between development and
defence and concentrated upon neither?
Or should those ten or 15 years be used
to build up regional and other defence
associations which give promise that, at
the end of the period, a future threat
would still be far from Australia’s
shores?
These are the basic questions to
which Mr. Gorton has to find answers.
His answers have varied. Influenced to
some extent by the audiences he has
been addressing for example he has
been hawkish speaking to Australian
troops in Vietnam, while talking like a
dove in Cabinet he has in turn
inclined toward one viewpoint and then
the other. This divergency of view-
point has, in part, been responsible for
the uncertainty which now surrounds
defence policy and about which Gov-
ernment parliamentarians complained
at the joint Government Parties’ meet-
ing in Canberra last week. The un-
certainty is also having a divisive in-
fluence upon the Cabinet.
Yet, it is hard not to feel sympathy
for Mr. Gorton.
It is the kind of momentous decision
that cannot be made in a hurry, except

in a moment of crisis, and, though
worrying to those involved, this is not
a moment of crisis. Just to add to the
difficulties, superimposed on the basic
questions, are such imponderables as
who is to be the next President of the
United States, his policies, the uncer-
tainty about the role of Japan, and the
outcome of the present negotiations in
Paris for peace in Vietnam.
Some of the uncertainty could be
removed by the strategic assessment
now being prepared for the Govern-
ment and to be considered by Cabinet
probably next month.
Defence Minister Allen Fairhall has
stated that the assessment is being
done in a depth never before attempted
in Australia, and there are suggestions
that the Government has gone outside
the normal Service organisations in its
search for the most experienced and
brainiest personnel. The assessment
could remove for Mr. Gorton some of
his own uncertainties, and produce the
more definite line that would be re-
flected in decisions on whether Aus-
tralian troops should be maintained in
a forward posture in Asia, either in
Singapore and Malaysia or South Viet-
nam, the form of their equipment and
armaments and general logistics.
Mr. Fairhall and External Affairs
Minister Paul Hasluck are clearly pre-
disposed toward retention of the
forward-posture policies of the Menzies
and Holt eras. They clearly see Aus-
tralia as having a responsibility for the
maintenance of stability in the South-
East Asian area and believe that this
is in Australia’s long-term interests.
There was more than a hint of con-
flict with Mr. Gorton or, more acur-
ately, with Mr. Gorton’s likely view-
point, after he has come to a con-
clusion on the assessment, in Mr. Fair-
hall’s statement in the Party room last
week: “The Minister for External
Affairs and I have the same views on
this matter.” His exemption of Mr.
Gorton from this statement suggests
that he believes that Mr. Gorton has
not the same views or may finally come
down on the other side of the fence.
There was an element of politics in
last week’s criticism by backbenchers of
the Government’s defence plans. A
number of backbenchers are against
an election being held this year. They
say frankly that there is no issue for an
election and no need to go to the
people. They refuse to accept the argu-
ment that Mr. Gorton needs to be con-
firmed as Prime Minister by the vote
of the people as well as the verdict of
his fellow parliamentarians.
There is also genuine feeling that
Australia’s defence efforts are insuf-
ficient for the needs of the time, though,
even among the Government critics,
there is some measure of uncertainty
about precisely what at this stage Aus-
tralia is preparing to defend itself
against. But passions are aroused and
the subject could prove as divisive for
the Government as hitherto it has been
a factor in uniting the Government
parliamentarians.

Turning the tables on John Gorton
AUSTRALIA
CANBERRA WASN’T really as paro-
chial last week as it sounded. In the
open forum of Parliament, the Budget
having been read, MPs climbed into
buses, toured the surrounding hills and
returned to debate the great issue of
where their new residence should be
sited. Was the new Parliament House
to be beside the lake or up the hill?
Despite his suntan and the previous
week’s holiday in Queensland, Prime
Minister Gorton looked tired and worn.
(He picked up the flu in Sydney on the
way back.) There was nothing in the
meeting of Government Parties on
Wednesday to cheer him up.
The subject was foreign policy, and
the occasion a concerted assault on the
Prime Minister for his lack of leader-
ship and his confused line of thinking.
In the official privacy of the Party room
one member after another rose to speak
his mind. And for the first time Defence
Minister Fairhall and External Affairs
Minister Hasluck joined critical back-
benchers in an attack on Mr. Gorton’s
“Little Australianism.”
“Australia’s defence planning,” Mr.
Hasluck declared, “must be based on
co-operation with the free and inde-
pendent nations of South-East Asia. We
have a position of greater influence in
the area than any other country. Asian
Foreign Ministers are constantly seeking
to ascertain the Australian viewpoint,
and are influenced by our policy.”
Speaking later, Mr. Fairhall said that
in his view the defence of Malaysia,
Indonesia, and Australia was indivisible:
“Australians are most welcome in this
part of South-East Asia.” Speaking of
the British withdrawal, and the uncer-
tainty of American policy, he said:
“Australia now faces an absolutely new
strategic situation.” He ended, pointedly,
by saying that “Mr. Hasluck and I
have the same view on these matters,”
leaving Mr. Gorton’s name unsaid.
Having no one come to his defence,
the Prime Minister ended the meeting
by saying that all these matters would
be “dealt with in the proper and
appropriate way,” and that when the
Government’s new strategic assessment
was ready the Parties would be
informed.
The nature of the challenge to Mr.
Gorton was indicated in another line
of argument put by Mr. Hasluck. He
said that Australia’s ambassadors and
diplomatic personnel were extremely
able and well-trained men who knew the
situation in the countries where they
were stationed. This was, of course, a
view which Mr. Gorton has repeatedly
questioned, having often pronounced
sweeping condemnations of the External
Affairs Department. It had even been
said on his behalf that one of the
major purposes of his American trip was
to check out the External Affairs assess-
ment of American attitudes to Austra-
lia’s South-East Asian policy.
Mr. Hasluck said that the great bulk
of Australia’s diplomatic talent believed
in the necessity of regional co-operation
and had the welfare of the region at
heart. While not yet fully mature, co-
operation in the region was developing.
This debate was sparked off by former
Navy Minister Don Chipp, sacked by
Mr. Gorton and understandably sore
at him. But, ironically, Chipp appeared
to have crossed right over from the
Fairhall-Hasluck regionalist position to
the Kent-Hughes-Wentworth retraction-
ist “Fortress Australia” concept. He was
convinced, he said, that Laos and
Cambodia would be taken over by the
Communists immediately after Vietnam,
and that Thailand would “go with the
strength.” Australia should withdraw
from Malaysia-Singapore, partly because
its position was likely to become unten-
able with the dominoes falling. He pre-
dicted that Australia’s presence .in
Malaysia was going to cause severe
trouble with the Philippines. He cited
the secondment of Australian Navy
officers to the Malaysian Navy as a
potential troublepoint. Some, he
claimed, command Malaysian ships
and their presence could involve Aus-
tralia in any fracas which might develop
between Malaysia and the Philippines
over Sabah. Australia should withdraw
its military forces from Malaysia and
Singapore and adopt a self-defence
policy styled on Israel’s methods of “hit
first and ask questions later.”
Mr. John Jess talked, too, of the
need for Australia to rely more on its
own resources, but, as a regionalist, he
added that Australia must assist others
as a matter of mutual defence. “We will
get more support from the United States
if we do something ourselves instead of
talking.”
New South Wales Liberal Mr. Tom
Ministers Fair hall (left) and Hasluck
(right) “agreed on these matters” but
left Prime Minister Gorton’s name unsaid
Hughes argued against the assumption
that Asia was finished, saying that it was
even wrong to write off Vietnam, let
alone the other countries of the region.
Mr. Harry Turner was most outspoken
in criticism of the Government for its
“dithering” on policy. The people of
Australia deserved to be given an
indication of where the Government
stood in relation to the dramatic
changes of the last year, he said.
Most of the things which would
affect future defence policy were now
as clear as they would ever be. The
Government should make its decision
and stand by it. Whatever the decision
on the defence posture, he was sure
that Australia needed greater military
strength now.
One or two speakers attacked the
simplistic nature of past Government
propaganda on foreign policy. The con-
cept of a “downward thrust by China”
was picked out for special attack.
The meeting saw only the weakest
advocacy of retraction into a “Fortress
Australia,” the regionalists appearing to
have gained the ascendancy. Which
suggests that the Fairhall-Hasluck team,
once in a minority, has now turned the
tables on Mr. Gorton.
THE BUDGET
TOO MANY STOP-GAPS
ANY PROSPECT of an early election
began to fade last week with the intro-
duction of -the Budget and the begin-
ning of a strong DLP campaign.
Whether intended that way or not,
the Budget was judged by most obser-
vers to be politically ill-constructed.


Pensioners and friend...only one of the disappointments of Budget week
Its unexpected tax increases might
dampen the Liberal Party’s election
chances, and business firms, who might
be expected to provide the bulk of
Party funds for electioneering, were
hit by a rise in company taxation.
Middleclass swinging voters were left
contemplating a wide range of sales-
tax increases.
Neither of the two principal gainers
from the Budget, the farmers and the
sick, are really likely to switch votes
on account of their better deal. Aged
pensioners are understandably, not
ecstatic about their extra dollar, an
amount they regard these days as a
necessary annual cost-of-living adjust-
ment. They had been expecting $1.50
or $2 more.
Education did better, with grants for
school libraries and for pre-school
teachers’ colleges being made for the
first time; Commonwealth tertiary
scholarships were increased consider-
ably, and the grant to the universities
for capital purposes shot up from $l6
million to $26 million (which suggests
that the universities have not suffered in
Government estimation on account of
mock crucifixions or battles with the
police).
But there were weaknesses in key
items. Untied grants to the States, for
example, increased by only six per-
cent, an amount which will hardly per-
mit them to deal with higher costs, let
alone population increase or demands
for better State Government services.
The theme of many State Treasurers in
their Budget speeches is going to be
the meanness of the Commonwealth.
And in development the Govern-
ment did not shine brightly. Although
many big development programs
the Snowy, rail standardisation, and
the equipment of the airlines with jets
are coming to a halt these three
items are costing the Government $75
million less this financial year than
last —• virtually no worthwhile pro-
jects have been adopted to take their
place. Projects such as the development
of nuclear power or assistance to State
Governments with metropolitan trans-
port improvement, although the sort of
measures which might have consider-
able electoral appeal, are not being
encouraged. There was some specula-
tion in Canberra, however, that Prime
Minister Gorton might have something
of this sort up his sleeve to announce
in an election campaign.
Defence is another stumbling block
which Mr. Gorton must surmount
before an election. DLP leaders have
been taking every possible platform to
tell the Government that it must have
a clear and firm defence policy before
an election if it is to get the support of
the DLP. On Monday, at a Press con-
ference, the four DLP Senators said
the Government could not rely on DLP
preferences automatically. Asked
whether a redirection of preferences
wouldn’t put the Labor Party into
power, Senator Gair said there was no
risk of that. “The risk the Govern-
ment faces is a drastic reduction in their
majority.” The DLP was prepared to
implement a flexible policy on prefer-
ences, and might not field candidates
in some electorates.
The 1968-69 allocation for defence
was a stop-gap figure, awaiting the new
defence program which Mr. Gorton
has promised for November. Leaving
aside the F-11l project, the defence vote
remained almost unchanged at last
year’s level. Many large defence items
showed diminishing expenditure—naval
construction, aircraft purchase and
manufacture, accommodation and tech-
nical facilities for the Army, and
defence research and development
and Mr. Fairhall announced the
gradual closure of the Government air-
craft factory. The DLP is likely to
want something better than that.
DEFENCE
SHOPPING FOR HARDWARE
“SORRY, WE DON’T have any
Admiral Crabb, sir. No one here
knows of any Navy man of that name”:
said the telephonist at the Navy Office
in Canberra. The Minister, Mr. Bert
Kelly, must have felt last week that
he wished he could answer Parliament
in the same way.
It was generally agreed that his
initial handling of the affair was ex-
cellent. “The affair had been blown
up out of proportion,” he said, and
we must realise that “admirals always
want more ships.”
But unlike the situation in the United
States, where such comment by service-
men is taken for granted and accepted,
it moves Australian politicians to a
rage. Under instructions from Defence
Minister Fairhall and the Prime Minis-
ter, Mr. Kelly took a hard line against
the Admiral. He had allegedly con-
travened Naval regulations by his com-
ments on Naval policy. Implausibly,
Mr. Kelly argued that the Admiral had
appreciated his error of judgment about
the non-viability of the squad of three
destroyers: this, said Mr. Kelly, was
not the opinion of the Naval Board,
which has to advise the Minister.
Implicitly, this seemed to acknow-
ledge the validity of the Admiral’s
other criticisms of the Navy namely
his advocacy of a strike aircraft-
carrier, his statement that one or two
more logistic supply ships were needed
to keep the present Australian fleet at
sea, now that the British fleet was
departing, and his suggestion that, to
protect Australian fishermen, another
20 or 30 new patrol boats were needed.
Naval experts quickly, if privately,
confirmed the correctness of Admiral
Crabb’s comments. They said that the
force of three guided-missile destroyers
failed to be viable because one des-
troyer, and sometimes two, would


always be unavailable for action, since
the ships are out on maintenance and
repairs a considerable number of
months each year. For a further period,
they are required off station for training
purposes. In addition they have to
spend time steaming to and from their
battle positions. As a consequence it is
impossible to guarantee that a pair of
ships will be able to be kept on station
all the time. And a pair is necessary
for mutual defence and for a com-
patibility of fire-and-control systems.
Admiral Crabb said that there was
now little possibility of getting a fourth
missile destroyer, but that the Navy
was considering a light version. Pre-
sumably this could be fitted with much
of the same equipment as the Brisbane,
Perth, and Hobart, allowing it to oper-
ate in conjunction with them.
The existing 20 patrol boats of the
Australian Navy could probably be
kept very busy in New Guinea waters,
let alone in providing some surveil-
lance of the 12,000 miles of the Aus-
tralian coastline. Admiral Crabb sug-
gested the need for another 20 or 30.
A total of 50 would see about 40 avail-
able for patrol work at any one time.
This would provide one boat every 300
miles on average around the coast,
meaning that nowhere would be beyond
Navy Minister Kelly...Admirals always want more ships
an eight-hour call. At present it can
take as long as a day and a half to get
a boat to a trouble spot.
The Crabb affair was a reminder
that, with the Australian forces hav-
ing to be more self-sufficient under
j. . r 13 «.• i , , j
conditions of British withdrawal and
. . . , r
American uncertainty, a number of
other hardware purchases will now have
, ~ j ,-r, .
o e consi ere . ere is increas
ing talk that the force of 24 F-llls
do not constitute a viable deterrent
force of themselves. It is argued that
to deter, Australia may need to be able
to threaten three or four major tar-
gets at once and be able to convince
an enemy that we are likely to get a
reasonable number of our bombers
through their interception defences.
On this basis, there is speculation
that the Government may at some
stage buy another dozen of the air-
craft. The Air Force will almost cer-
tainly have to be given more trans-
port aircraft if the Army is to oper-
ate as a viable self-sufficient force. In
Vietnam it relies almost as heavily as
the Vietnamese Army on American
helicopters. And for fire support it
depends on American heavy artillery.
Whether the Government adopts a
retractionist or a regionalist approach to
defence following its current defence
review, the development of greater
self-sufficiency and balance within the
Australian Armed Forces seems essen-
tial.
THE VAN GOGH
"BATTLELINES"
AUSTRALIA’S PRIVATE cold war
entered a new phase last week when
the “Russian 'bully,” the 6000-ton
trawler Van Gogh, reappeared in the
Gulf of Carpentaria while our master
strategists were basking in the belief it
was refuelling at Singapore.
Although Australian newspapers car-
ried the story of the return of Van
Gogh on Thursday morning, the cus-
todian of Australian prawning, Primary
Industry Minister John Douglas
Anthony, was still telling the House of
Representatives just after midday The
latest report is that it (the Van Gogh)
, , * , , r , . c . ° '
has unloaded or refuelled at Singapore
and wi|l bc comi back jnto the 6 G^lf ...
TT ~ , ctA , . .
He added, As soon as that boat
comes into the Gulf of Carpentaria it
win be under surveillance by our patrol
craft and by aeroplanes. If it breaches
the i avv by coming inside the 12-mile
fishing limit it will be prosecuted—
action will be taken.”
An hour later, Anthony was sounding
the call to arms. At last, the Australian
Government had received official con-
firmation that the ship was back in Gulf
waters. The interdepartmental com-
mittee conceived during the Van Gogh’s
first ravishing of the lush prawning
grounds of the Gulf, comprised of senior
officers of seven Departments—Defence,
Air, Navy, External Affairs, Attorney-
General’s, Primary Industry, and Prime
Minister’s—hastened to External Affairs
to draw up battlelines to curb the
activities of the Russian invader.
Doctor L. D. Thomson, Assistant-
Secretary in the Economic Relations
Branch of External Affairs, was put in
charge of planning operations (later
reports indicated the balance tipped his
way because his branch has communica-
tions with Thursday Island) and the
Navy and Air Force was placed on
standby. Meanwhile, the Van Gogh
remained annoyingly in international
waters, peaceful and serene, not bother-
ing anyone.
But lessons have been learned from
that earlier visit. The Russian Embassy
in Canberra this time decided it has
nothing to do with the Van Gogh.
Just as sure that he wants nothing
to do with the Van Gogh this visit
is our Prime Minister, Mr. Gorton,
whose impetuosity during the first visit
—the immediate dispatching of a patrol
boat to the area—gained him the tem-
porary sobriquet of “Gunboat Gorton.”
A wiser man, he left things to his
lieutenants this time.
The only question now remaining is:
what happens if Russia follows the same
tactics adopted by the British when
their trawlers run into trouble around
Iceland, and sends some of its Navy to
look after its own? But at this stage
it appears the Van Gogh is doing quite
well unassisted.
Canberra has gone coy on its inten-
tions, and information is classified —
requests to Primary Industry are re-
ferred to External Affairs, requests to
External Affairs are referred to Primary
Industry, Air and Navy know nothing,
and Attorney-General’s is still trying to
find out whether the 12-mile limit can
be applied to islands as well as the
mainland.
ADELAIDE
MR. HALLS WINDS
OF CHANGE
THE WINDS of change which have
lately been disturbing the political
arbors on Adelaide’s North Terrace, last
week blew a sudden squall. The clouds
gathered as the Premier, Mr. Hall,
spoke frankly to delegates at the open-
ing of the Liberal Country League
annual conference, saying that the
Party would never be the same once
the Government’s electoral proposals
went through, that it would never
again hold office with 43 percent of
the vote, and that, as the public
demanded change, so the Party should
initiate it. For the LCL, the political
wing of South Australia’s old yeomanry,


these were strong words indeed, but
more was to come.
In closed session, the conference was
asked by the Premier to vote in favor
of a general adult franchise for the
Legislative Council, which at present
is elected on general head-of-family
lines by property owners, occupiers of
dwelling houses, and some returned
servicemen. It is not compulsory for
eligible persons to either enrol or vote
for the Council, and with five four-
Member districts, three of which are
in the Country, an LCL majority of
16 has been a permanent feature of
South Australian political life. The
Council has almost unlimited powers
to amend legislation, and was a con-
tinual harassment to the past Labor
Government. Even Sir Thomas Play-
ford found the Council obstructive
when, in 1946, he initiated moves to
nationalise the old electric supply
company; and then in the ’fifties, when
some members of the Council endea-
vored to have Price Control abolished.
In supporting moves for a general
adult franchise, the Premier was aided
by the Attorney General, Mr. Robin
Millhouse, who, as the Member for
Mitcham, must have been one of the
prime movers —the motion being sub-
mitted by that district’s committee.
The move clearly disturbs the old LCL
order for which the Council is more an
article of faith than a branch of the
Legislature. The Chief Secretary and
Leader of the Government in the
Council, Mr. Degaris, clashed sharply
and strongly with the Premier on the
issue. Mr. Degaris, who last year
fatuously described the Council as “the
permanent will of the people,” and
thus implied that somehow the
Assembly was the impermanent will of
the people, argued to conference that
if the motion was passed it would mean
that the Council would become merely
Hall...LCL should initiate change
a rubber stamp, that its house-of-review
functions would degenerate, and that
the present franchise adequately repre-
sented a cross-section of the State. The
motion was lost when 60 percent of
delegates voted with Mr. Degaris,
though Mr. Hall must have some satis-
faction in knowing that a significant
and influential group were in favor of
a less grossly distorted pattern of Upper
House representation.
Another Legislative Councillor was
in the news last week when the Minister
for Roads, Local Government, and
Transport, Mr. Murray Hill, again dis-
played his flair for a ministerial
dominance of South Australian media.
Stringing the process out over a number
of days, he presented what is probably
one of the most ambitious city-trans-
port plans introduced in Australia. At
a cost of what will probably be some
$6OO million, Adelaide is to have (over
the next 18 years) an underground
railway, six new freeways, a city traffic
tunnel, and a wide variety of bus,
bridge, and parking projects, all de-
signed to give the city rapid access to
a greatly expanding metropolitan area
with a projected population over the
million.
The plan has taken some three years
to complete and has involved top Aus-
tralian and American consultants. In
its scope and detail, its analyses of
economic factors and its respect for
parks, gardens, and integrated residen-
tial areas, it is the kind of professional
planning approach Australian architects
and town planners have been demand-
ing for decades.
BRISBANE'S STRIKE
TRADE UNION VERSUS
LABOR LORD MAYOR
ABOUT TEN years ago the Brisbane
City Council, then controlled by a
municipal Party now in Opposition (the
wanted to convert about half
its tram services to one-man bus ser-
vices. After a short strike, the State
Tramways Union agreed to the move,
and manned the 350 new buses as well
as the Council’s 300 or so trams. The
service continued to lose money, as most
public transport services do; but none
of the Tramways men lost their jobs.
Those who couldn’t or did not want to
transfer to bus employment stayed with
the trams.
But this year it became obvious that
the Tram and Bus Union would soon
have a new cause for concern. Bris-
bane’s Labor Lord Mayor Jones wanted
to get rid of the remaining trams and
tramlines, and, against fairly widespread
public opposition, he finally named a
doomsday for the trams. The rundown
would begin with a switch from trams
to buses on the city’s Grange line on
August 12, and finally the last tram
would stop by March 31, 1969.
While the Civic Liberal Party tried to
oppose Jones’ move by a poll which
claimed to find public opinion running
Jones ...withdrioew his offers
four to one in favor of retaining the
trams, the union threatened strike action
unless conductors were employed on the
buses—at least in peak hours. But it
was ten years too late to press that
point, and the Lord Mayor quickly
rejected it.
Trying to bargain, the union asked
for 15c an hour for one-man bus
drivers, and severance pay for the 300
conductors who might become redun-
dant. While Jones postponed the
Grange switch to buses, first for one
day and then for one week, State
Industrial Commissioner Pont stepped
in to call a series of compulsory con-
ferences. The first two drivers had been
suspended, and the union had then re-
fused to man any buses or trams. On
August 8, a mass meeting heard a
report on the bargaining, rejected the
Lord Mayor’s latest terms (1£ weeks’
pay for each year of service for the re-
dundant and 12|c an hour for drivers)
and decided to fight on.
At that point, other trade union
men’s views began to veer between
sympathy for the strikers and amaze-
ment that they had not only been able
to extract such a redundancy concession
from an employer, but were demanding
more —two weeks’ pay for each year of
service. This was far beyond anything
that Queensland railwaymen, for in-
stance, had been able to win when some
of them became redundant during the
change from steam to diesel loco-
motion.
Brisbane’s annual Show opened on
August 9, and, despite emergency pri-
vate bus services, lost more than half
its normal attendance and takings (rain
undoubtedly contributed) during its
run.
Last week, as the strike continued
and the public went busless and tramless
there were increasingly anxious moves
to compromise from either end. On
Tuesday the Lord Mayor offered to find
City Council jobs for the 300 redundant

men, but stuck to his guns on one-man
buses. The union said it was not good
enough; a great many miscellaneous
tramwaymen, other than conductors,
had not been mentioned. It wanted the
conductors employed for two-hour shifts
during peak hours, making up the rest
of their week selling tickets at bus
stops.
Last Friday, as the strike went into
its 11th day and the City Council losses
passed the $lOO,OOO mark, the Tram
and Bus Union demanded a flat guaran-
tee that no man would be dismissed
before or after March 31, 1969—and
Lord Mayor Jones withdrew all of his
offers, pointing out that patronage could
fall off as a result of the long strike,
some of the present services might have
to be curtailed, and he could not let
the union tie his hands.
It seemed that, whatever happened
toward the end of the strike, the Tram
and Bus Union had pushed too hard
because its adversary was a Labor Lord
Mayor. For this, the strike would be
remembered long after redundancy
issues had become commonplace.
PADDINGTON
FINAL VERDICT
SYDNEY NEWSPAPERS’ correspon-
dence columns won’t be quite the same
now that Paddington residents have won
the war against the N.S.W. Department
of Main Roads’ plans to tear down 400
houses to send two arterial highways
slicing through the area.
It’s been a nine-month battle —people
vs. planners —and the victory seemed
assured in Paddington’s favor last March
when Walter Bunning, an architect
appointed by the Government to con-
duct an inquiry into the proposals,
offered his verdict.
Paddington, he said, could be to
Sydney what Chelsea is to London, the
Morton...no more dithering

Village is to New York. And it should

character.
Anyone less vigilant than the Pad-
dington campaigners might have
relaxed after that. But they didn’t, since
they were uncomfortably aware that the
Government was not bound to the
recommendations in the report. Two
months after its release, the letters began
reappearing, and a week ago they
were sounding new tones of urgency and
anxiety.
One complained that all the proper-
ties along the proposed roadways were
“frozen” as a result of “bureaucratic
dithering,” and continued, “we are led
to believe the delay is due to failure of
the State Planning Authority to submit
its comments on Mr. Bunning’s recom-
mendations to the Minister.”
Two days later, the Minister for
Local Government, Mr. Morton,
announced the Government’s decision
in an answer to a question in the
House, a question prompted by the
letters.
One imagines there are a few
nostalgic reminiscences mixed with the
sighs of relief echoing round Padding-
ton’s wrought-iron, and winding streets.
After all, it’s been a stirring time, with
some memorable bits of oratory at all
those emotion-filled meetings. There
was the colorfully conspiratorial get-
together at Rudy Komon’s art gallery
one rain-swept Sunday (Mr. Komon’s
gallery was earmarked as one of the
projected casualties), and the climactic
gathering of 400 at Paddington Town
Hall in mid-January.
And then there were the hearings
before Bunning. Two thousand people
requested representation, and cam-
paigners organised “The Battle of
Paddo” fighting fund, in which they
hired a QC to appear at the inquiry.
The hearings themselves were all-star
cast occasions, with local identities, like
artist John Olsen and the übiquitous
Mr. Komon, on hand to give graphic
descriptions of Paddington’s qualities as
artistic colony and haven of Victoriana.
But the day outdoors was best
when Bunning decided to walk through
Paddington, sample residents’ reactions
and savor the atmosphere of the place.
Accompanied by officials of each side,
and a secretary clutching maps of the
endangered area, he proceeded, each
movement and comment recorded by
cameras and reporters.
After such drama, one can under-
stand the Paddington people’s appre-
hension when the months of silence after
Mr. Bunning’s report continued.
But, as Mr. Morton explained last
week in the House, the State Planning
Authority was not the bureaucratic
villain in the last act of the piece. The
delay was caused by St. Vincent’s Hos-
pital, who have never been very happy
about the alternative proposal Mr.
Bunning’s plan adopted the widening
of Boundary Street. However, the Gov-
ernment has reached “an amicable
settlement” with the Hospital, and
Paddington will live on.

What hope
is there for
the lbos?
Ibo leader Colonel Ojukwu
at the abortive peace talks at
Addis Ababa, where he main-
tained Biafra’s right to secede
from Nigeria
NOW THAT the long-feared invasion
of the Ibo heartland has begun, and
even if, as is likely, the Federal troops
cannot be held back from taking the
last three Ibo-held cities Aba,
Umuahia, and Owerri a cease-fire
could still avert the worst of the dis-
aster if it meant that the fall of these
cities would not simply be the prelude
to prolonged guerilla warfare. This
would lead to endless slaughter; it
would inflate the already huge num-
bers of starving refugees; it would pre-
vent relief agencies getting adequate
help to those dying of famine and
disease; and what is most to be
feared if Ibo guerilla resistance
should turn out to be as tough as Col.
Ojukwu promises, it is likely to result
in just that kind of decimation the
Ibos most fear.
The Federals don’t take very seri-
ously the risk of prolonged guerilla
resistance once Ibo supply lines to
the outside world have been cut. They
might well be proved wrong: it is
possible that the Ibos, genuinely be-
lieving they are engaged in a war of
survival, will fight on and on and on.
In fact, there is really no way of
foretelling the Ibo capacity for guerilla
resistance. All the experts are merely
guessing. But, however long and sangu-
inary the denouement of the civil
war, the really important question to
be faced is: what does the future hold
for the Ibos?
If the Ibo struggle is, indeed, “a war
of survival” as many believe it is
the question of deciding on the right
policy would be simple: to encourage
Ibo resistance and to mobilise world
support for their cause.
But if the Ibos are not threatened
by genocide, and if there is a possibility
of getting a sensible political settlement,
encouraging them to resist will only
produce a situation in which mass
killings will continue indefinitely.
So the first question to be answered
is whether Nigerians are fighting a
limited civil war or whether the Ibos
are fighting a war of survival.
Most Ibos, at the start of the war
over a year ago, were convinced they
were a people chosen by their enemies
to be the victims of genocide a state
of mind easily explained by the ghastly
massacres of Ibos in the north in 1966.
Yet, horrible as the war has been, there
is no evidence of any attempt to kill
off the Ibos systematically, as happened,
say, to Armenians in Turkey or to Jews
in Occupied Europe.
By no means all Ibos believe the
Federals are engaged in a massacre of
their own people. Some of them are
associated with the Federal cause
not simply quislings, but men of repute
and with ideological conviction. There
are Ibo officers fighting with the Federal
forces and the police; Ibos in the
Federal civil service and administrators
of the captured areas of Biafra; a rep-
utable Ibo academic is one of the 12
commissioners in the Federal Govern-
ment. Nigeria’s most prominent radical
leader, Mr. Sam Ikoku, heads a com-
mittee of Ibos which believes that “the
security, liberty, and advancement of
Ibos as an ethnic group or as individual
citizens are attainable within the con-
text of a united Nigeria.”
Of course, these men might be wrong
in trusting the Federal authorities. One
looks for evidence of the way ordinary
Ibos are treated when they are under
Federal control. And a striking fact is
that there are now almost as many Ibos
living in Federal territory as there are
in the besieged Ibo heartland.
Of the estimated 14 million Ibo
people, just under seven million are in
the heartland. Almost six million are
in territory controlled by the Federal
Army well over a million never, in
fact, left their homes or jobs in other
parts of Nigeria. These Ibos suffered
harshly at times from military and
police harassment, but these incidents
mostly occurred when the Ibo military
threat was at its height.
The six million Ibos living in army-
occupied territory suffered cruelly when
the actual fighting was going on. They
still suffer whenever Biafran counter-
attacks are made in their area. But,
although there are still too many
occurrences of brutal behaviour by
troops “enjoying” the rights of occupa-
tion, official policy is to encourage a
return to normal life. Abakiliki one
of the heaviest populated Ibo areas, now
wholly in Federal hands is perhaps
the best argument against the idea that
I'bos are 'being exterminated wholesale.
But there is still the question
whether the Federals intend to adopt
policies in future that would subjugate
the I'bos politically and economically.
Certainly, there are strong anti-Ibo
feelings, even hatred, which are bound
to persist. Anti-Iboism is nothing new.
But the Ibos were, of course, better able
to deal with it when they formed one
of the three dominant groups in the
country.
But there is no way, at this point,
of saying definitely what kind of treat-
ment the Ibos might expect in the
future. A great deal would obviously
depend on a new constitution to be
agreed upon. The capacity of Ibos to
influence its shape would depend on
how strong their forces are by the time
they reach the negotiating table.
What of an independent Ibo State?
It would, at most, consist of the present
heartland and of the Ibo parts of the
midwest, and, unless it were established
by agreement, it would be an enclave in
a hostile region. It would be deprived
of a large part of the oilfields and it
is difficult to see how 13-14 million
Ibos could survive in it.
They would be denied freedom of
movement: their trade, on which they
must live, would be subject to tariffs;
communication would be severely cir-
cumscribed. Such a homeland could
not be viable. Unlike Israel, the Ibos
cannot look to a worldwide community
to sustain them through difficult years
of enmity.
The best hope for the Ibos may,
therefore, be to find a political agree-
ment through negotiations with their
neighbors. Whether such an agreement
gives them full independence or only a
measure of autonomy would depend on
the negotiations.
Ironically, if they were to enter into
negotiations now, they would no longer
be isolated in the Nigerian community.
They would find strong support among


the Yorubas and the Hausa States for
a confederal type of solution which
is what Colonel Ojukwu has favored
in the past. By fighting to the bitter
end the Ibo leaders may be leading
their people into the very desert from
which they need to escape.
MALAYSIA
HANGING IN THE
BALANCE
From HARVEY STOCKWIN
in Kuala Lumpur
AT A TIME when Malaysia is faced
with the possibility of another Con-
frontation, the old one is being allowed
to cast an unduly long shadow. In
Pudu Jail, in the centre of Kuala Lum-
pur, 11 men are awaiting execution.
In effect, they are to be hanged for
treason, but they have not been tried
or sentenced for that crime there
would be no issue if they had. Instead,
they have been condemned to death
under Section 57 of the Internal
Security Act, under which the carrying
of firearms or ammunition is punish-
able by death.
In the days of Confrontasi, the 11
also “consorted with the enemy”; some
of the condemned men took part in
the Indonesian landings at Labis in
Johore in September, 1964, after train-
ing in Indonesia. Some, if not all, the
condemned men are adherents of the
Labor Party, then, as now, opposed to
the concept of Malaysia. Even though
the emergency powers given the Gov-
ernment during Confrontation were
meant to hasten the Government’s
capacity to make examples of disloyal
elements, numerous appeals ending up
at the Privy Council have delayed any
“example” being made. Partly as a
result of all the delays, the 11 men look
like doing more damage to the concept
of Malaysia as they await hanging than
they ever did as infiltrators into their
own country. That this is so stems
A demonstrator (r.) in an unequal struggle with police outside
Kuala Lumpur’s Pudu Road prison last week before 11 Malaysian
Chinese were given a stay of execution. The picture above is a
flashback to Labis, Johore, in September, 1964, where the 11
detained men took part in illegal landings from Indonesia
from the fact that they are all Malay-
sian Chinese.
Had the emergency powers in fact
operated to minimise legal delay, then
the hanging of the 11 would almost
certainly have passed off unnoticed,
especially if Confrontation had still
been going on when it happened. Now,
of course, Confrontasi is already only
a memory, and was concluded amidst
much Malay brotherly feeling. The
Indonesian soldiers with whom the 11
consorted have been returned to Indo-
nesia. In these circumstances had the
Malaysian Government’s mercy quickly
operated to commute their hangings
to life imprisonment before or as soon
as the 11 became the object of political
agitation, then that, too, would have
passed off virtually unnoticed except to
the gratification of a few.
But the issue has been allowed to
bump and grind itself across the com-
munal face of the Malaysian body
politics. As a result, the Alliance Gov-
ernment would appear to have so boxed
itself in on this issue that now, while
commuting the sentences to life im-
prisonment, may offer some slight
political advantages, more likely, what-
ever the Government does, it will be
the loser.
If it commutes it will appear to be
giving in to Opposition (largely pro-
Chinese) agitation. If it hangs, then
it will appear or be made to appear
heartless and anti-Chinese. Again, if it
hangs, it gives the Malayan Communist
Party an issue, while if it doesn’t it
possibly gives them recruits. There
are many, many more ins and outs, all
of which stem from the fact that a
question of hanging has become a
question of politics.
It must be stressed that such a
question is highly complicated, with
more twists and turns to it than there
are hairpin bends on a mountain road
in the Swiss Alps. To simplify, in a
multi-communal society, few, if any,
issues are seen purely on their merits,
but become distorted as they are seen
through each community’s looking-glass.
To put the matter at its crudest, for
the Malays there is a natural tendency
for the guilt of the 11 to be assumed
on the grounds that they are “Com-
munists” and Chinese; for the Malay-
sian Chinese there is the converse
tendency to assume innocence. Such
attitudes quickly translate into politics.
If the sentences are commuted, the
ruling United Malays Nationalist
Organisation (UMNO) will lose out,
since the Malays will regard it as being
“soft” on the Chinese. If the hangings
take place, then the Malayan Chinese
Association (MCA) will be adjudged
as having once more failed to “stand
up for the Chinese.” Put another way,
the UMNO-MCA Alliance dilemma
was well described by the comment
of one neutral observer “What sad-
dens me about this whole matter is
that within my limited experience and
contacts I haven’t met one Malay who
insisted the 11 should not be hanged,
and I have yet to hear a Chinese say
that they should.”
Thus, by being both firm and legal,
and at the same time dilatory, the
Alliance Government has given the
appearance of trying to get the best
of both worlds and looks more likely
to get the worst of both.
The issue first came to the fore
about tw r o months ago when the Sec-
retary-General of the new Gerakan
Rakyat Malaysia, Dr. Tan Chee Koon,
started to campaign on behalf of the
condemned men. Dr. Tan made it quite
clear that had the men been tried and
convicted for treason he would not
have pleaded their case. But since some
of the condemned were under 21 when
arrested, since Confrontation is long
since over, since to hang them will be
portrayed as revenge —the Mentri Besar
(Chief Minister) of Johore had pub-
licly spoken of the hangings in relation
to the 15 Malays killed on the border
by the Malayan Communist Party in
June —and since they were convicted
under the emergency regulations, of


which he has been a foremost opponent,
Dr. Tan who as a Christian
Socialist might have done better to say
straight out that he was against capital
punishment in the first place pleaded
that the sentence should not be carried
out.
As a result of his stand various
Opposition parties followed Dr. Tan’s
lead and were naturally far less fussy
in arousing communal emotions as they
worked the issue over. With the Prime
Minister, Tunku Abdul Rahman, still
absent in London, the Government paid
little heed to Dr. Tan’s appeals. All
the condemned men are subjects of
the State of Johore, which, by some
quirk of the Malaysian constitution
processes, leaves the last word not with
the Yang di-Pertuan Agong acting on
the advice of the Prime Minister, but
with the Sultan of Johore acting on
the advice of the Johore’s State
Pardons Board.
So far the Board has rejected all
pleas and appeals even when made
by the Tunku upon his return. Some-
where along the line it was discovered
that two Malays were awaiting the
same punishment for the same crime,
but since they have pending appeals to
the Privy Council there is no possi-
bility of the rougher edges of the issue
being smoothed by members of both
communities hanging together.
The 11 were due to be hanged last
Friday, August 16. Demonstrations and
arrests took place in Kuala Lumpur
and Penang on Wednesday and Thurs-
day, though they were predictably con-
fined to supporters of the Labor Party.
What is unpredictable at this point is
whether communal tensions have been
aroused to the point when, as with the
devaluation riots in Penang last year,
the few can light the fuse to a wider
conflagration involving many. Against
this, while there are emotions and ten-
sions, there are also Malaysia’s very
tough riot squads.
At the eleventh hour the Tunku inter-
vened. He sent a special message of
appeal to the Sultan of Johore, who
convened the Pardons Board once again.
The Board ordered a stay of execution.
Said a Prime Ministerial statement:
“The Prime Minister is not prepared to
say anything more about this matter
at this stage, but appeals that everyone
should keep calm.” Said Dr. Tan: “The
Tunku has done it again by his
humanity ... he has shown he is really
Baba (father of) Malaysia.”
But what this move means is not yet
apparent. Maybe the Johore-Federal
Government-Agong-Sultan dichotomy
will be unravelled, with face saved all
round. It would now seem as unlikely
as it would be unwise that the 11 will
be hanged. For what this issue means
is painfully obvious. Communal sus-
ceptibilities have been aroused. Hanged
or unhanged—there will be a kickback
for the Alliance either way. Having now
postponed the executions, the best way
of getting out of the bind, largely of
their own making, would seem to be
to hope that magnanimity in politics is
still the truest wisdom.
The four for Chicago
America/The Presidency
DEMOCRATS, ALL SHADES
Hubert Humphrey
Lester Maddox
Eugene McCarthy
George McGovern
GOVERNOR Lester Maddox last week
announced his candidacy for the Presi-
dency. The first-term Georgia Gover-
nor thus became the fourth contender
for the Democratic nomination. His
entry into the race was good news for
Senator Eugene McCarthy, though
probably not good enough for him to
shake Vice-President Humphrey’s
seemingly assured hold over the
majority of the 2622 delegates due to
assemble in Chicago on August 26.
Whatever convention votes the
segregationist Governor manages to
attract will come from Humphrey
backers in the States of the deep South,
though even there his support is not
likely to prove widespread. A former
restaurateur who went out of business
rather than submit to a court order
inhibiting him from refusing service to
Negroes, Governor Maddox is probably
too extremist a figure seriously to chal-
lenge Mr. Humphrey’s overwhelming
command over the allegiance of the
broad mass of Southern delegates.
Although published delegate counts
continue to give the Vice-President a
sum total of only just over 800 con-
vention votes, it is understood that a
recent private .“hard-nose” count of
his pledged supporters yielded him
over 1600, or more than 300 above
the 1312 votes needed for convention
victory. According to the calculations
of his staff, that total could rise to
more than 1900 if “favorite son” candi-
dates continue to withdraw, as two
have done in the past few weeks.
By contrast, the upper limit of
Senator McCarthy’s strength is con-
cluded, even by his own staff, not to
exceed 700 (in terms of publicly com-
mitted delegates, it currently stands at
436). Even given the expected accretion
of the bulk of the 172-strong Cali-
fornian delegation, support for Senator
McCarthy is unlikely to rise above the
700 mark, unless his campaign man-
agers achieve an unexpected success in
challenging the credentials of various
State delegations (most of them from
the South, including Georgia) that they
claim have been “packed” by pro-
Humphrey elements.
The last-minute effort of the second
anti-war candidate, Senator George
McGovern, of South Dakota, seems so
far to have made little headway. By
no means fully backed (as he had
clearly hoped) by former Kennedy sup-
porters, Senator McGovern now
appears more and more to be placing
his emphasis on getting an anti-
Vietnam War plank into the Party
platform. The battle on that began this
week at platform hearings in Washing-
ton, and could yet place Mr. Humphrey
in an embarrassing dilemma between
his loyalty to the present Administra-
tion and his obvious desire to unite
the Party.
Mr. Humphrey’s own confidence,
however, appears complete. Obviously
encouraged by the nature of the Repub-
lican ticket selected in Miami two
weeks ago, he has already announced
the date and place for the opening
of his own Presidential campaign
against Mr. Richard Nixon a vast
trade-union rally to be held in New
York on Labor Day, September 2. The
choice, a variation on a Democratic
Presidential candidate’s traditional first
appearance in Cadillac Squaire, Detroit,
seems designed to emphasise Mr. Hum-
phrey’s belief that union votes will
see him through, both at the Demo-
cratic Convention and at the actual
election in November.
A yet more reassuring announce-
ment even to his trade-union supporters
would have been some indication of
whom he proposes to select as his
running-mate. Growing hopes are now
being expressed that the Vice-President
may feel prepared to leave that choice
open to the convention. Mr. Humphrey
is said to be not unsympathetic to this
argument, if only because he persists
in believing that it could yet provide
the way of getting his heart’s desire:
Teddy Kennedy as his running-mate.
Most of his campaign advisers are
nothing like so sanguine about that
particular prospect.


GREECE
THE POLITICS OF PAPA
Papadopoulos unscathed ...“God is a
Grecophile”
PREDICTABLY, an attempt has
been made on the life of Mr. Papadop-
oulos, the Greek Prime Minister; and
almost equally predictably Mr. Papa-
dopoulos has emerged unscathed and
has thanked the Almighty for his deliv-
erance. “God is a Grecophile,” he said,
and “has protected Greece once more.”
After some confusion, the would-be
assassin has been identified as Alekos
Panaghoulis, a militant leader of the
Papandreous’ youth organisation which
whipped up frenzied demonstrations in
Athens three years ago. On hearing the
news in Stockholm, Professor Andreas
Papandreou immediately hailed the
attempt as an “act of heroism.”
Whether it marks the beginning of a
concerted guerilla campaign is any-
body’s guess. The odds are that it does
not; but some of the more militant
resistance leaders want to destroy the
Papadopoulos regime now before it
gets some degree of public endorse-
ment in the plebiscite on the constitu-
tion next month.
The danger is that last Tuesday’s
melodramatic event will make the
whole situation seem much more simple
than it in fact is. The resistance groups
are appallingly disunited, in the best
Greek tradition; and Professor Papan-
dreou’s attempts to nobble the leader-
ship of a unified resistance movement
have only bred distrust and disunity
among the groups he is trying to co-
ordinate. It is not inconceivable that
before this tragic and lunatic interlude
in Greece’s history is over they will be
fighting one another rather than col-
lectively fighting the junta. Similarly,
the junta itself is far from being the
monolithic entity it appears on the sur-
face; Mr. Papadopoulos has had to dis-
play some modicum of political skill
to hold the disparate groups together.
For all his faith in divine provi-
dence, Mr. Papadopoulos is obviously
a worried man. The assassination
attempt looks like being the pretext
for a policy of brutal repression of
“Fascists” and “Communists” alike;
within a matter of hours, many emin-
ent and obviously innocent people were
rounded up, including retired Right-
wing officers, Centre Union politicians,
and journalists. If the colonels have
any sense at all, they will act with
restraint, allow next month’s plebis-
cite to be carried through as normally
as possible, and proceed to the holding
of elections. But this may be wishing
for the moon.
The pivotal question, however, may
be the role of Mr. Karamanlis, the
former Radical Union Prime Minister.
He has denied that he plans to return
to Greece at this stage; but he is
obviously waiting to see which way the
cat is going to jump. According to
reliable reports, he was secretly con-
tacted in Paris where he has been
in voluntary exile since 1963 by a
quasi-official representative of the
junta and was told that if he would
return and accept the new constitution
the way would be paved for his re-
emergence as a national leader. How
much confidence Mr. Karamanlis has
placed in this assurance is unknown;
but he has been significantly silent
about the junta’s misdeeds for a long
time. The Americans are in touch with
him perhaps too closely in touch
and would be delighted if he would
go back to Athens and make the junta
respectable.
If he should decide on this course
he will automatically alienate himself
from Professor Papandreou and the
other resistance leaders. Athens would
become the scene of fierce political in-
fighting, from which the strangest
alignments might emerge. But this
would be better than prolonged dic-
tatorial rule, or civil war.
CZECHOSLOVAKIA
SHUT UP, MOSCOW!
RESUMPTION of attacks last week
from Moscow has been a shock to the
Czechs. It has put the Czechoslovak
leaders in a difficult position. They
have succeeded so far in persuading
Czech editors to refrain from open
ddbate with the Soviet Union and its
four loyal allies, but this understand-
ing was reached only on a basis of
reciprocity.
Czechoslovak editors met in Prague
last Friday night to discuss the new
situation, which they consider intoler-
able. They sent a letter to their leader,
Mr. Dubcek, immediately after the
meeting urging him to make representa-
tions to Moscow and warned that, if
he did not, they would feel free to
answer back. The Czechoslovak Foreign
Minister, Jiri Hajek, met the editors
at the weekend to discuss their request.
According to one editor, Mr. Hajek
asked the journalists for further re-
straint.
The resumption of polemics co-
incided with a widespread campaign
throughout the country by conservative
supporters of former President Novotny,
using the old-guard officials still in
key positions to intimidate the 1500
newly elected delegates to the Extra-
ordinary Communist Party Congress,
which is to open in Prague in two
weeks’ time. Two-thirds of the new
delegates are men and women with pro-
gressive views who are expected to rid
the Central Committee of the Con-
servative elements.
Czechoslovakia and Rumania last
week pledged friendship with the Soviet
Union and its allies but, at the
same time, called for the development
of relations with all countries, regard-
less of their social systems.
Meanwhile, from Moscow it is re-
ported that Russia in turn is angry
with Czechoslovakia for failing to carry
out its part of the agreement thrashed
out at the Warsaw Pact summit in
Bratislava. This is thought to account
for the new wave of criticism of Czecho-
slovakia in the Soviet Press. But there
is no evidence in Moscow to suggest
that the Czech crisis will flare up again.
Details of the Bratislava Accord have
remained a mystery. But it is thought
the Czechs gave the Soviet leaders
three assurances, which made a suc-
cessful compromise possible.
The Czechs apparently undertook to
strengthen the primary cells of the
Communist Party in order to give it
new vigor at grass-roots level. They
agreed to discipline the Press and elim-
inate from it criticisms of the Soviet
Union and the fundamentals of Com-
munist ideology.
Finally, they are believed to have
agreed to curb the non-Communist
opposition and prevent the emergence
of any alternative to the official Party.
This analysis of the reasons behind
the resumption of verbal hostilities is
hinted at in a long article by Yuri
Shukov, one of the most authoritative
political commentators in the Soviet
Union, which “Pravda” published last
week.
Moscow, impatient to see these
undertakings fulfilled immediately, is
irritated by the apparent willingness of
the Czechs to permit anti-Communist
criticism in their own newspapers.
But the Russians are proceeding with
caution. The opposition they encoun-
tered within the Communist movement
over their Czech policies has had a
restraining effect.
Stories are being retold in Moscow
of how President Tito of Yugoslavia
told the Soviet leaders that if they in-
vaded Czechoslovakia he would go to
the United Nations Security Council
personally to indict the Russians of
aggression.
Similarly, the Italian Communist
Party is believed to have informed Mos-
cow that it would be obliged to organise
an international brigade to help
Czechoslovakia.
Although some of these stories may
be apocryphal in form, they reveal the
firm opposition to Soviet moves ex-
pressed by Communist leaders and
Parties outside Russia. The fact that
these stories are circulating among the
Russian public is also significant and
helps to explain Soviet restraint before
the crisis exploded.

A
look
at the
beauty
business
By SANDRA HALL
Packaging is a big part of presentation and price
FIVE O’CLOCK, and the women’s
washroom in the city office block re-
sembles a backstage dressing-room.
Make-up bags sit precariously on
narrow shelves or spill over into wash-
basins; faces, newly creamed and free
of make-up, stare with strange bland-
ness into the mirror; and hair is teased
and contorted in its tortuous path to-
ward shape.
It is metamorphosis time time for
the hairpiece to emerge from its dust-
free plastic bag, the false eyelashes to
be carefully put on, and the darker,
deeper shadows to be drawn around
the eyes.
In a day so far devoid of change,
this is the time for it. Perhaps the job
is dreary and the evening’s escort prom-
ises to be even drearier, but this half-
hour is something apart from all that;
it is time for the construction of a
fresh face and a little pretence about a
new self.
Beauty is no longer a gift which
bestows itself upon some women and
ignores others. It’s a skill, a duty, and
a science, depending how seriously you
want to take it, a kind of geometry
which splits a face into a set of dia-
grams to be filled with color like the
blank figures in a child’s painting book.
Today, a woman with the time,
money, and the inclination has the
means to turn her appearance into an
absorbing hobby, remaking herself each
morning or evening with a dazzling
array of tools. Magazines are quick to
convey shifting patterns in the art, and
cosmetics houses, attuned to each trend
before it happens, are ready to supply
the means to comply with the latest
decision on matt or gleam, lip, eye, or
cheekbone emphasis. Followed to its
extremes, it can all turn into a hideous
rat race, of course. No sooner have you
mastered the delicate process of apply-
ing false eyelashes than some kind
friend informs you that those in the
vanguard are now cutting up their sets
of false eyelashes in order to apply
them singly between their own lashes.
“So much more natural, dear.”
Models are the high priestesses of
beauty, easily observable as they pro-
ceed through town carrying those
capacious bags which hold their col-
lection of pots, potions, pastes, and
hairpieces. And from time to time we
are told admiringly of their cosmetics
experiments in interviews which reveal
facts like the marvellous effect so-and-
so is achieving by using her brown eye-
shadow on her lips.
One might expect all this clinical de-
tachment about beauty to rob it of
something of its illusion. But that’s
not so. The beauty people are still
among the most high-powered of to-
day’s image purveyors. Cosmetics manu-
facturers spend a substantial percentage
of their overheads on promotion and
advertising, while packaging accounts
for more than half the cost of their
materials.
According to the Commonwealth
Statistician, manufacturers in Australia
must charge an average of $6.50 a
pound for foundation cream and cake
to make a profit after normal factory
expenses plus promotion and advertis-
ing. Deodorants average $2.80 a pound,
while cream hair-rinse in small
amounts, individually packaged, works
out at $1.50 per pound. Paradoxically,
we pay a lot for beauty because we
must first be convinced of the necessity
for each new ramification of it.
No one quite knows how these things
happen, but between 1962 and 1966 the
production of nailpolish increased, the
manufacture of hair-rinses and hair-dyes
almost doubled, yet that of home per-
manent-waving kits dropped. Almost
three times as much eye make-up is
being made, while the manufacture of
lipstick and rouge has fallen slightly;
pressed face powder has doubled and
loose face powder has dropped. The
tastemakers, whoever they are in the
beauty business, exert a potent influ-
ence.
At present, this influence is centred
on hair on its control, coloring, and
embellishment. In one year, from the
end of 1965, the production of hair-
sprays, creams, and fixatives shot from
4.8 million pound weight to 7.4 million
pound, and the value of the output of
aerosol hairsprays was $3,420,000 at the
end of 1966.
In a development which provokes
disgusted sounds from the executives
of the larger cosmetics firms, hairspray
has become involved in price-cutting
practices. The brands are numerous,
and they’re on sale everywhere.
Napro, a wholly Australian hair-care
company, stopped marketing trans-
parent hairspray two years ago be-
cause of price-cutting competition.
“Twelve components go into one hair-
spray formula,” says Napro’s chief
chemist, Alfred Langsam, “because you
have to get so many properties into
it sheen, quick drying, control with-
out tackiness. And you can’t tell me
they get all that at such cheap prices.
We’ve kept producing color spray and
we will go back into the transparent-
spray market, because we’re going to-
work on new materials, so we can
compete in a different way.”
Not too long ago, a new hat was
thought to be the thing for “taking
one out of oneself.” These days it’s
new hair, and if you want to forget
who you are for a while a wig is
one way of trying it. One manufacturer
says that within the next five years
the average woman will own six to
eight hairpieces, buying them as she
does shoes.
“Sometimes I think every business-
man who passes through Hong Kong
buys a few hairpieces to sell back
here,” he says, adding that he believes
it’s the biggest thing since the plastic
flower craze. “A few people ’are going
to fall on their faces, of course.”
One person who looks as if he’s
going to avoid any face-falling is Jack
Kohane, a Melbourne 'businessman who
switched from hats to hairpieces to
establish Tovar in Australia. Tovar is
an American company which was
started by Madame Tovar and her
partner, Jack Rogers, an ex-actor and
ex-Army colonel, 20 years ago, when
Madame Tovar became interested in
the idea of using synthetic fibres for
dolls’ hair. Later, Union Carbide de-


What is available for men and being used by
them in increasing numbers
Pause for reflection in the wig-shop
veloped a fibre called Dynel, in 30 basic
colors, which could be mixed by “hack-
ling,” the flax-blending method used
in the manufacture of linen. And in
the late ’fifties Madame Tovar and
Jack Rogers took the idea to Macy’s,
the department store.
Girls trained in the technique of
hackling were installed in the store
to make up hairpieces for customers
while they waited, the business spread
through the U.S., and now has outlets
in Europe, Canada, Mexico, and
Scandinavia.
In Australia, Kohane had made a
tentative and unsuccessful attempt to
introduce human hairpieces to the
Australian market in 1958, but two
and a half years ago he made a trip to
the United States and met Jack Rogers.
“First of all, I met someone at a
party who told me about hackling and
said he’d teach me to do it. I said
that wasn’t exactly what I had in
mind although I did want to learn
Full splendor of wig and false eyelashes
more about the whole thing. So I rang
Union Caribide, and they introduced
me to Jack Rogers. We got on pretty
well together and signed a rough sort
of agreement. Then, later on, he came
here for two and a half days and we
finalised things.”
Dynel is sent to Australia in five-
ounce packs, in which the colors have
been blended, then it’s sold through
about 50 retail outlets throughout Aus-
tralia by girls trained in hackling (a
practice which apparently attracts
almost as many viewers as buyers).
Kohane also imports hairpieces from
Hong Kong, which are sold in hair-
dressing salons, and this year will be
introducing special wig-cleaners, one
for Dynel and one for human, hair.
He’s also launching a new fibre called
Excelon, which is shipped from Japan,
where it has been formulated, to
Manila, where it is made into hair-
pieces. “You can’t color-blend it, but it’s
finer than Dynel and, so, closer to
human hair. And you buy a full
stretch wig in Excelon for $3O as com-
pared to $57 for one in human hair.”
So far, hairpieces for men are not
included in this sort of mass production.
“Tovar tried it,” says Kohane, shaking
his head, “but they didn’t catch on. It’s
still necessary to maintain a certain
amount of privacy when you’re dealing
in men’s hairpieces.”
Traditionally, cosmetics advertising
is lush, other-worldly, and larded with
euphemisms. Faces don’t age, they
mature, they don’t develop pimples,
they become troubled, and preparations
moisturise, lubricate, nourish, refresh,
cleanse, highlight, and color-control. Up
until the past few years, packages have
usually been in pastels, white, or gold,
discreetly whispering prestige or being
a little more blatantly sentimental,
especially at Christmastime. For
example, Avon’s new line, “Unforget-
table,” comes in a gold box adorned
with a pink ribbon and hand-written
fragments of poetry —“My heart is like
a singing bird
Whose nest is in a watered shoot” . . .
and so on.
But when Mary Quant decided to
bring her determined modernism to the
beauty industry, she did it with new
Britain’s straightforward style, and it
contrasted sharply with all the exciting
faces of beauty in the marketplace. Her
packages were black and white, their
only decoration the Quant flower
symbol, radiant adjectives were ignored
for no-nonsense colloquialism (one
product’s called “Starkers”), and con-
venience became the main criterion for
packaging, with units like “Mary
Quant’s Paintbox” and a new fold-over
plastic kit made to fit unobtrusively in
a handbag.
And Miss Quant announced that the
most important thing about any make-
up should be that it stay on—in and
out of bed. The Quant beauty, all this
implied, had fun and moved fast.
Quant products have been selling in
Australia for the past 15 months,
although they are still fully imported
by an agent, along with other English
brands which include Miners and
Rimmel. These two, which are much
less expensive, are aimed mostly at the
teenage market. Miners has been selling
in Australia only for nine months,
although Rimmel has been on sale here
for the past 12 years. Another fully
imported newcomer to the Australian
market is the American brand Estee
Lauder, one of the most expensive of
all and acknowledged in the trade to
be “in . the Bentley class,” according to
one executive with a feeling for cars.
The Cosmetic and Toiletry Manu-
facturers’ Association said recently that


an average Australian family of five
spends $5O a year on toilet preparations,
adding up to a retail sales volume of
$l4O million a year. One store executive
said the cosmetics market is now
“almost saturated” and that his store
would hesitate about accepting new
brands (“except for two or three
American names”). But as nobody’s
saying just how well his business is
doing it’s hard to estimate which brand
is the biggest seller.
Avon, which sells best world-wide
and in America, is the most communi-
cative company when it comes to the
touchy business of figures.
Since it was set up here in mid-1963,
its profit figures have rocketed. In the
first year of operation, it lost million,
and in the year ended December, 1967,
it had a profit of $860,978. The
accumulated profit since 1963 has been
$1,091,709.
Avon attributes its success to direct
selling, the company’s unwavering
policy since it was established in 1886
by a Californian bookseller named
David H. Connell. Connell used to
peddle books in small Californian
towns, giving away free samples of per-
fume to his customers. But the perfume
proved more popular than the books,
so he moved to New York, rented a
loft in downtown Manhattan, had a
druggist make up batches of perfume,
and with a $5OO loan from a friend
formed the California Perfume Com-
pany.
His products were sold door to door,
although his agents weren’t the tra-
ditional itinerant salesmen but house-
wives recruited to sell only in their
own communities. Customers, Connell
reasoned, would feel more confident
about buying from someone who had
a respectable reputation to uphold
rather than from a stranger unlikely to
be in the neighborhood the next day.
And he was right. Avon now sells
door to door in 13 countries, and
through retail outlets only in places
like Hong Kong and parts of Africa,
where there aren’t established suburbs
able to support the practice.
The staff here are all Australians,
although the department heads have
each spent a year working for Avon
in the United States. The company
already manufactures here, but its
large and elaborate new factory and
office block at French’s Forest, in Syd-
ney, is not yet completed.
Avon representatives, the company’s
advertising and sales-promotion man-
ager, Christopher Humphry, stresses,
are not “beauty experts, just Australian
women interested in cosmetics.” And
so Avon markets no medicated prod-
ucts, hair-dyes, or hormone creams.
Treatment stops at “standard care of
the skin.”
But saleswomen do attend a beauty
class shortly after they’re appointed, to
teach them, first of all, the finer points
of applying their own make-up. While
they are certainly not required to peer
into a customer’s pores and announce
an on-the-spot diagnosis of her particu-
lar “skin problem,” they are expected
Mary Quant ...her idea of beauty is to have fun and move fast
to look as if they know how to use
the company’s product. Then the rest
is left to the customer, who is able to
choose her make-up from a chart the
saleswoman carries in her demonstration
bag.
This bag contains a few samples of
Avon’s newest line (there’s an addition
to the range every three weeks), to-
gether with a lavishly illustrated cata-
logue. Along with cosmetics and men’s
toiletries, Avon has what it calls its
family needs and children’s products,
which run from mouthwash, tanning
lotion, air-freshener, and smokers’
toothpaste to “Avon’s Good Habit Toys
good grooming products for the
tots,” which come in plastic containers
decorated with clowns, firemen, and
policemen and fitted with stoppers
made from toy whistles.
It seems it’s all part of Avon’s
determination to take advantage of its
chosen sales environment, the home.
Even the beauty products are packaged
in what Christopher Humphry calls
“a decorator concept.” In other words,
they’re made to look good in the bath-
room.
Apart from Avon, “the big four”
among the cosmetics houses here are
Revlon, Max Factor, Helena Rubin-
stein, and Elizabeth Arden, and while
the fact is difficult to substantiate it’s
thought that among these four Revlon
has forced itself into the lead position
in recent years with increasingly
persistent promotion. Revlon products
have been on sale here since 1947, when
David Jones’ was the Australian agent
for them. Revlon Australia was estab-
lished ten years ago, and “about four
years ago we started to pick up
momentum,” says the company’s
managing director, Fred Kovaleski.
Revlon had its American beginning
in the bathtub of Charles Lackman, a
chemist who used the tub to make up
batches of nailpolish for the Revson
brothers to sell to beauty salons. The
company was formed in 1932, lipstick
followed nailpolish and after the war
came Revlon’s famous “Lips and
Fingertips” promotion.
In Australia, the company now manu-
Elizabeth Arden ...the “nastiest
business in the world”
factures 1300 different products, most
of which are spread across four separate
make-up ranges, varying in price
from the standard and teenage lines
to the prestigious “Ultima” products,
all discretion and gold-leaf lettering.
Despite the euphemisms in its ad-
vertising and the mellifluous voices of
its demonstrators, the cosmetics in-
dustry, in America at least, is hardly
cosy. Before her death two years ago,
Elizabeth Arden called it “the nastiest
business in the world,” and while she
and Helena Rubinstein were not
friendly rivals, they were united in their
dislike of Charles Revson. “I never
really liked that man,” Miss Arden
said once, while Madame Rubinstein
liked to refer to him as “dot nailpolish
man.” Estee Lauder is reported to
share their animosity, and he apparently
reciprocates her feeling.

not so much at odds with one another
as at pains. None of the “name” cos-
metics houses is a public company,
and although most belong to the
Toilet Preparations Association and are
prepared to act in concert on a num-
ber of matters, they are careful not to
reveal too much to their com-
petitors. Sales figures, for instance, are
never released.
Except for Max Factor, who main-
tain unlimited distribution, they are
similarly careful about their retail out-
lets. Before opening an account with
an agency, they make sure it is in a
lucrative location and that it is not
already carrying too many competition
brands. (One Sydney chemist knows
other pharmacists who have been asked
to sign an undertaking not to stock
certain rival brands.)
There may be little evidence of
brand loyalty among customers, but
most companies insist that each prod-
uct in their make-up lines is formu-
lated to team with the rest and that
you cannot expect optimum results if
you deviate from their particular co-
ordinated beauty plan. Revlon demon-
strators are trained to suggest to cus-
Helena Rubinstein...not exactly
friendly with her rivals
tomers that they buy all their make-
up within the same range rather than
switching from “Demi” to. “Ultima” or
vice-versa. And according to Elizabeth
Arden’s publicity officer, “If you’re a
good girl and follow through with our
products using our moisturiser, day
cream, and night cream with the right
strokes you shouldn’t have prob-
lems.”
Elizabeth Arden has been known as
a “skin-care house” since 1904, when
Miss Arden, a Canadian, decided skin
care was more important than make-up
itself and marketed a complete range
of treatments. The company is proud
of the fact that people with particular
skin troubles, allergies for instance, go
to their New York laboratory to con-
sult their chemists.
Yet even they don’t manufacture
hormone creams, since these are classi-
fied as a drug, subject to the United
States Food and Drug Administration’s
licensing and labelling rules, and so are
banned from use in significant quantity.
Instead, Arden’s has “Creme Extraor-
dinaire The Bloom of Youth in a
Single Jar.”
Most cosmetics sold in Australia are
formulated at the head offices of the
companies, and samples of products
manufactured here from the original
formula have to be sent back to the
United States or the United Kingdom
for checking. A few companies are
equally fastidious about packaging,
which is all done here.
At Max Factor’s factory in Sydney,
the manufacture and packaging of the
Christmas perfume and cosmetics range
is already under way. On one floor,
cases of talcum powder stand ready for
incorporation into Creme Puff. Every-
thing is covered in a pink, powdery-
film, and rows of overalled women put
caps on bottles of perfume or pass lip-
sticks over bunsen burners, whose flame
gives them that look of glossy invitation.
The floor above is stacked from floor
to ceiling with packaging. All this
Christmas gilding means the company
has to rent extra space to accommodate
it.
Christmas also means increased sales
in men’s toiletries, now making a sub-
stantial, if not spectacular, impression
on the Australian male’s prejudice
against such artifice. According to the
Commonwealth Statistician, almost two
and a half times as much after-shave
lotion was manufactured in Australia in
1966 as in 1962, while the manufacture
of deodorants has increased by the
same amount.
In Australia, the pursuit of beauty
doesn’t yet take in the specialised re-
finements flourishing in America and in
Europe—there are no beauty farms
where devotees retreat for expensively
masochistic programs of repairs and
regeneration, although there are beauty
clinics offering the more esoteric treat-
ments like skin peeling and electronic
facials.
In Sydney, one salon uses for facial
massage a German brush treatment,
which reportedly simulates the effect of
a dozen hands, another beautician
swears by the effectiveness of her
“marine philosophy” of beauty based on
seaweed, and somebody else advocates
turtle oil.
George Korn e r , a gregarious
Hungarian, whose family has been in
the beauty business for more than 50
years, has, perhaps, the best advertise-
ment for his establishment. There are
three generations of KCrner women
living in Sydney—George Korner’s
mother, Madame Korner, who has
retired from taking an active part in
the business, his sister, and his niece,
each of whom has skin to render all
euphemisms irrelevant.
But if all women were similarly-
endowed there’d be no room for hope,
and a little less room for the beauty-
business.

Endless ly
asking, “Who
are we?”
By DENIS O'BRIEN
Dr. Grace Perry makes a
point
Mr. John Pepper Clark, of Nigeria, and
Dr. Miriam Dixon, of the University of
New England, at a conference on the theme
of national identity in Brisbane last week
Conference secretary, Air. Ken
Goodwin, with Professor A.
Norman Jeffares, of the Univer-
sity of Leeds.
BRISBANE’S extroverted Lord
Mayor, Alderman Clem Jones, a civic
fireball who virtually runs the city
with a skilful blend of cold business
efficiency, autocratic ruthlessness, and
man-of-the-people charm, was cheer-
fully confused. “I have just, ah, been
talking,” he said, with all his public-
speaking pauses in the correct places,
“I have just been talking with four
of your delegates and I’ve had four
different explanations as to what this,
ah, conference is all about.” (Much
loud laughter and splashing of
municipal beer.) A Queenslander
standing with a group of visiting
Africans reddened with embarrass-
ment, stirred his foot around a City
Hall carpet, and hissed, “Stupid
philistine!” But Alderman Jones’
waspish irony wasn’t altogether mis-
placed.
By its third day last week the con-
ference on “National Identity: Litera-
ture and Language in the Common-
wealth” seemed to be in need of clear
definition, and although the Lord
Mayor’s civic reception for the 105
Australian and overseas delegates
didn’t release a sudden sense of en-
lightenment there was, subsequently,
a noticeable thaw in the ice which
protected some delegates’ private
doubts and confusions.
The conference was held on the
spacious Queensland University cam-
pus at St. Lucia where it had, as
neighbors, a vacation school on English
for external students, and an Arts
Council school of creative arts.
(Downtown, meanwhile, the Austra-
lian Society of Authors was conduc-
ting a seminar on professional writing.
It was a heavy week of abstractions in
Brisbane; by comparison, the cool
science of the medical congress in
Sydney seemed enviably comprehen-
sible.)
When referred to by its short title,
the National Identity conference
sounded like a grouping of people who
were either unsure who they were or
unnecessarily and belligerently certain;
by its full title the conference had an
anachronistic ring, suggesting that the
Commonwealth was still an unaltered
entity if not quite the same thing any
more as the British Empire. In fact,
there was enough evidence of British
motivation and support to see British
diplomacy usefully at work helping to
keep Britain’s political options open and
continuing to extend a maternalistic
influence around the bits and pieces
of her bygone Empire. What it all
amounted to was a gathering of
novelists, poets, dramatists, and
academics (a thick layer of academics)
from most English-speaking countries
to consider how a country’s writers
reflect and determine national identity;
whether writers help to establish a
sense of nationality or whether “the
writer must free himself from the
restrictions imposed by a sense of
nationality.”
In prospect and retrospect it seemed
to be a largely academic exercise, and
was aptly summed up by a heretical
Australian delegate who confessed, “All
this talk about literature seems deter-
mined to take the pleasure out of read-
ing books, and whatever little pleasure
there might be in writing them.”
The conference was sponsored by the
Association for Commonwealth Litera-
ture and Language Studies, an organisa-
tion almost single-handedly brought
into being five years ago by Professor
A. Norman Jeffares, of the University
of Leeds, who, on his way to Brisbane,
“carried out missions for the British
Foreign Office,” whatever significant
meaning that was supposed to have.
Professor Jeffares quite obviously is
a smoothly forceful administrator and,
from an accounting he gave, the
Association seems well, if not over-
generously, endowed. The inaugural
conference was held in Leeds in 1964;
the next one will be in the West Indies
in 1970 or 1971. Canada will organise
the West Indies conference under a
policy which seeks to keep interest in
the association vitally alive by spread-
ing a responsibility for its affairs
among as 'many member-countries as
possible.
Paradoxically, Britain sent only two-
delegates to the Brisbane conference.
Others wanted to attend but couldn’t
afford it, said Jeffares. Canada sent 11,
India five, Pakistan four, and there was
representation by Uganda, Nigeria,
Singapore, Ceylon, New Zealand
(four), Malaysia, Hong Kong, and the
United States. Australia had around 40
delegates at the conference, the most
notable of them being Professor James
McAuley.
But it was more fascinating to count
the egg-heads than merely the heads.
Professors predominated; misters were
in the minority. And, although the dele-
gates had turned out an impressive
amount of writing between them, there
was no feeling that they represented
'much more than a very marginal part
of the life-force of literature they were
discussing.
Australia, for instance, fielded the
poets James McAuley, Thomas Shap-
cott, and Rodney Hall, but no prose
writers of stature. The Canadian pro-
fessor-poet Earle Birney, elderly-
statesmanlike in Nehru jacket and long,
grey side-levers, came closest to getting
guru status at the conference.
On my first night at the conference
I was introducd to a group of delegates
one of whom, a young woman, asked,
“Are you an academic?” When I
answered, “Good God, no!” she pealed
a cry to a nearby group and said, “I
say, he’s not an academic.” For several
days afterward I was an object for
distant curiosity, although I was not
alone. At one conference session I sat
alongside Mr. James Goonewardene, of
Ceylon. He introduced himself by
saying, “I’m a novelist, not an
academic.” Identity often seemed less a
case of nationality than a summary of
scholarship.
The conference yielded a great many
scholarly papers (amounting to more
than 200,000 words by my count) but
not much stimulating thrust and parry
in discussion. By the time of delivery,
attitudes often were set too hard to be


moved. “We should have had Max
Harris here,” said one Australian dele-
gate. “Him or some other dancing
bear,” said another gloomily.
Thomas Keneally (who didn’t get a
mention at the conference) was in town
but not on campus. He was addressing
the seminar on professional writing on
what seems to have become one of his
favorite topics —• the agonising difficul-
ties of authorship.
Mr Keneally, one of Australia’s best-
endowed writers in the last decade, was
presumably being ironic when he
warned, “If you have a good job and
superannuation, do not write profession-
ally.” But what he called a “burst of
disgusting frankness the life of a
novelist is lonely and monstrous,” was
thoughtfully reported by the Brisbane
“Courier-Mail,” which followed up his
remarks with an editorial, tense with
sympathy at the plight of the Australian
writer.
“For every successful Morris West,”
the editorial said, “there are dozens of
authors of a standard who, in the
United States or Britain, would make
a reasonable living from their writing,
but who, in Australia, cannot live by
their books alone.”
The intention was good but the equa-
tion was unfortunate. After all, the
Morris Wests of the world can look
after themselves, and Mr. West himself
is hardly representative of Australian
literature or, in the definition of the
National Identity conference, literature
at all. His name wasn’t even whispered
there.
But then again, national identity in
literature is not always seen as an
entirely worthwhile aim. In the same
editorial, the “Courier-Mail,” continu-
ing its quick analysis of problems of
authorship in Australia, said: “Many
Australian novelists tend to create
characters in their books who are so
emphatically Australian that they cease
to be people. And so their books are'
harder to sell abroad.”
National identity in those terms
wasn’t at all what the conference on
Commonwealth (or English-language,
for the sake of better understanding)
literature was all about. Yet, by the
end of the first day’s barrage of papers
It was apparent that there were many
divisions over the necessity either to
saddle a. writer with national identifi-
cation responsibilities or the real
value in looking for them anyway.
Theory began pushing against theory,
and contradiction against contradic-
tion until the theme began to have
difficulty surfacing above the seman-
tics
The Canadians, a brotherly delegation
intent on substantiating each other, did
produce one piece of passionate heresy
a paper by Miriam Waddington
entitled “Canadian tradition and
Canadian literature.” Summarily, Mrs.
Waddington said: “There is no real
Canadian literary tradition but only a
social matrix, an accumulation of his-
torical events, full of contradictions,
forces, and counter-forces. We live in
a sort of vast cultural chaos upon
which we are all free to draw. We
possess a promiscuous history which
contains not just abstract patterns but
specific items. There will be perhaps
even now there are poets and
critics who will not only acknow-
ledge but accept this promiscuity, this
randomness, without having to make it
glorious or even mythic . . . but the
lack of a guaranteed outcome in the
matter of national identity is no reason
to lose hope. When Canadian writers
become willing to examine the denied
realities and admit them back into our
national life, then, and only then, will
we be able to speak of the Canadian
tradition.”
Unfortunately, Mrs. Waddington
hadn’t arrived from Canada to deliver
her paper and it was summarised with
no little alarm, if not distaste, by a
Canadian academic.
James Goonewardene made a feeling
point about Ceylonese writing even if
it did seem to contradict the essence
of national identity. He referred to a
review of his recent novel, “A Quiet
Place,” which had said, “In spite of
150 years of English culture in Ceylon
—-or maybe because of them—Ceylon-
ese creative writing in English has been
largely derivative and insincere.”
Goonewardene’s own novel was hav-
ing good sales, but what was of greatest
importance to him was that the interest
in the book had come mostly from
“the common run of people,” particu-
larly those nursed on Sinhala writing.
The greatest resistance to it had come
from “the small coterie of the middle-
class people, who had dominated the
scene until recently.”
“The point I am trying to prove,”
said Goonewardene, with no great suc-
cess, “is that what had stultified writing
in English earlier was not so much
English culture as denationalisation and
the denial of nationhood.”
By now, delegates were beginning to
talk around the theme rather than to it.
Discussion periods began to reveal an
aridity of deep interest, even, some-
times, of understanding.
Dr. Grace Perry, of Sydney (she
edits “Poetry Australia”), almost invari-
ably animated the discussions with
merry rhetorical charges through the
rhetoric, and was a great favorite of
the Indian and African delegates. But
after she’d dropped the limp witticism
that national identity was like the
human face “You don’t go around
talking about your own, and if your
neighbor doesn’t have one you don’t
mention it” it became more and
more difficult to take the conference
seriously.
And when Rodney Hall produced a
chart from his desk, as poetry editor of
“The Australian,” revealing that only
three of 293 manuscripts submitted to
him during a year exhibited a con-
scious national language identity, and
that 154 of the poems had exhibited a
“search for a non-national identity,”
the theme looked like a very naked
contrivance.
However, the conference was valuable
for personal contacts, not to mention
the opportunity to make hurried addi-
tions to reading lists. Also it stood
strangely as both a confirmation and
contradiction of McLuhanism as a phil-
osophy in the one sense because such
high-minded scholarship must surely
have difficulty surviving in an audio-
tactile age, and in the other because
McLuhanism can’t possibly support
such intensive academic study of nations
and their literature.
Professor Marshall McLuhan was
even mentioned at the conference. In a
paper on national identity in English
Canadian writing, Professor Roy
Daniells, of the University of British
Columbia, said:
“Northrop Frye and Marshall
McLuhan, in Victoria College and St.
Michael’s College, a literal stone’s
throw from one another these two
critics offer us two widely divergent
stances in which to face the future
events now bearing down on us. For
McLuhan the future means commit-
ment to mass media, self-determining
their messages in a global village where
instantaneous communication reduces
all phenomena to the same value, as in
the pages of the “New Yorker” maga-
zine or the screen of television’s world
news. For Frye, the future, if there is
to be any, must concern itself to recog-
nise and reinterpret the fundamentals
of traditional belief. It must revitalise
a coherent, if flexible, mythology . . .
My own sympathies are all with Frye,
whose latest book says, “We are moving
toward a post-national world, and . . .
Canada has moved further in that
direction than most of the smaller
nations. What is important about the
last century in Canada is not that we
have been a nation for a hundred years,
but that we have had a hundred years
in which to make the transition from a
pre-national to a post-national con-
sciousness.”
Without his meaning to, I thought
Mr. Edwin Thumboo, of the University
of Singapore, contributed the most apt
summary of the whole conference in a
paper on Malaysian poetry in which
he said:
“The poet’s position in the con-
sciousness of his society is fluid. He is
seldom the norm, working out of what
is ‘doctrinal to the nation.’ Nor does he
reflect the ethos of his community for
either our convenience or as a primary
purpose of his poetry. While we may
use his work for isolating a national
identity, that would be our undertaking,
not his.
“Indeed, we should be surprised if
he were not wise enough to avoid
dealing with national identity. To take
to it would be to risk his personal
identity, his own image of himself. For
national identity implies a summing up
of attributes, a levelling off.
“And what profiteth a man if he
gaineth national identity, but loseth the
power of his poetry.”

Very little left unsaid
BONE-WEARY, elegant in a suit
which must have been designed by
Cardin, long, tapering, traditional
surgeon’s hand, and long, tapering feet
in beautiful Italian boots, the man of
the hour, Dr. Christiaan Barnard,
arrived in the Greek Room of the Uni-
versity of Sydney. Some university wit
obviously chose the Greek Room for
briefing journalists on the latest in
medicine since most of the sessions
were Greek to us all.
Flanked by other eminent doctors
who had also spoken during the morn-
ing’s plenary session, Dr. Barnard
seemed almost luminously magnetic
to them. Old hands at transplanting
kidneys leant along the table toward
him, and his flashing smile was re-
peated along the line. Alarm that the
Press would ignore other famous
doctors in their pursuit of the news-
maker had forced an alteration in
the initial public-relations scheme to
let each doctor meet the Press in-
dividually after presenting his paper
and panels were arranged.
However, just as the Press was about
to unleash a series of questions to
Doctor Barnard, quite probably about
Sophia Loren, one of the Congress
officials reiterated that only the sub-
jects discussed during the morning’s
session were to be topics for question-
ing. As these had 'included “Applica-
tion to Autoimmune Diseases”
“Prophylaxis of Foetal Damage” and
a discussion of the disease kuru found
in New Guinea, as well as the trans-
plantation papers, there was a distinct
feeling of nonplussedness among the
questioners. So much so that Dr.
Barnard himself asked his colleagues
why Australia was lagging so far be-
hind in heart transplant when she had
been so far ahead in kidney trans-
plant.
Schedules must be maintained in a
congress of the magnitude of last
week’s at the University of Sydney.
Two thousand doctors milled around
the campus, suitably labelled and all
clutching green attache-cases provided
by Qantas. For the first time the
British Medical Association and the
Australian Medical Association were
holding a joint annual meeting, and
the current President of the Austra-
lian Medical Association, Dr. C. O. F.
Rieger, CBE, was also to be installed
as President of the British Medical
Association.
A notable scientific program had been
set up under the chairmanship of Pro-
fessor John Loewenthal, Dean of the
Faculty of Medicine, University of
Sydney, to which had come, as well as
Dr. Christiaan Barnard, Lord Todd,
Master of Christ’s College, Cambridge
University; Sir Macfarlane Burnet,
joint Nobel Prize winner; Sir Brian
Windeyer, Dean of Medicine at the
University of London; Mr. Robert V.
Cooke, president of the British Medical
Association; and Sir Leonard Mallen, of
the World Medical Association, to name
only a few.
There were 260 papers to be read in
three days, all complete with slides and
graphs and models and time out for
questioning. And the 2000 doctors mill-
ing around and industriously registering
for social and other arrangements had
to be cared for in a co-ordinated split-
second effort. They were invited to
attend a Government House garden
party, an official reception and a ball
and, probably very suitably for a group
so absorbed at the present time with
death, to an organ recital. Tours of
the Opera House could be arranged.
There was a rather salutary comment
in the notes on social events that “every
effort has been and will be made to
ensure that Congress members and
associates will be wined and dined”—so
that anyone who was not wined and
dined would know that every effort had
been made.
But even without wining and dining
the doctors had every advantage to
enjoy themselves within the scientific
program. The films projected for them
throughout the Congress were a festival
to end all Sydney film festivals. “Bullet
Embolus,” for instance, has a most grip-
ping precis: “This film illustrates an
unusual surgical case in which the
patient was shot in the left buttock with
the bullet passing through the rectum
and coming to lie tetroperineally. The
bullet subsequently moved to the heart
and at a successful open-heart operation
was found beneath one of the papillary
muscles to the tricuspid valve.” And
there was one film called “Thromboe-
dendartherectomy for Femoropliteal
Obstruction.” Another was “The Acute
Abdomen”—“this film deals with the
problems associated with diagnosing
acute abdominal pain and includes
some interesting scenes from resulting
operations.” Australia weighed in on
Wednesday .with “Birth of the Red
Kangaroo,” “The Mallee Fowl,”
“Where the Pelican Builds Her JMest,”
and other nature films.
Some of the papers might have been
better named for the lay reader.
“Miscellaneous Surgery” has a rather
alarming connotation. This chill, scien-
tific detachment is alarming for non-
doctors to (meet, particularly on such
unprecedented scale. When hundreds of
doctors inspect a trade exhibition of
rather macabre possibilities, discuss the
finer points of cut and thrust, and laugh
merrily at medical jokes, the prospective
patient feels the wind of insecurity.
Professor Henry G. Miller, of the
University of Newcastle, England, drew
hearty laughter from his colleagues
when he said that mortality had fallen
at his hospital. The sight of doctors
laughing gaily at this sally was quite
sobering but, no doubt, it is a happy
thought.
The papers delivered during the
Congress covered a very wide range of
subjects. The four main plenary ses-
sions were on “Research The Grow-
ing Edge,” not only concerned with
organ transplant but with research in
general practice; “How Many Doctors?”
which discussed student selection, stu-
dent training, the disappearing GP,
and specialist training and distribution;
“The Advantages of Modern Techno-
logy,” which ranged widely from iso-
topes through spare parts, the Pill, to-
allergies and childcare; and, finally,.
“Back to Work,” discussing everything
from laboratory and forensic medicine
to sunlight and the skin, and the health
of Aboriginal children.
The paper of Dr. A. I. Adams, a
lecturer in the University of Sydney’s
Department of Preventive and Social
Medicine, was on “Research Methods
in Community Health.” Dr. Adams said
there had been little or no attempt to
assess the health needs of Australians
as a whole, and as a result too little
was known of the basic distribution of
chronic disease. In the United States,
the National Health Survey, through
studies of health records, surveys, and
examinations, was able to provide re-
search workers and health planners with
a continuous picture of the health of
the nation. But here conclusions were
too often based on poor data and im-
properly selected samples in surveys.

tion’s Congress in Sydney last week


BY APRIL HERSEY
Professor John Beveridge, the pro-
fessor of pediatrics at the University
of New South Wales, who spoke about
“Prophylaxis of Foetal Damage,” said
the list of agents known or suspected
of causing damage to the’' unborn child
was growing steadily, but the agent in
which interest was concentrating was
cigarette smoking. Women who smoked
heavily were far more likely to abort
or have stillborn or deformed children
than non-smokers. Unsuccessful preg-
nancies were also higher among
unskilled and semi-skilled social groups
and among women who had illegitimate
babies. This is the knowledge that
gives us more shame,” he said.
The growing popularity of skindiving,
and the attendant risks, were the subject
of Surgeon Lieutenant - Commander
G. Bayliss, who said that in Australia
since 1961 there had been 56 deaths
among civilian divers using snorkel or
compressed-air apparatus. Knowledge
of safety techniques had not kept pace
with the popularity of diving as a sport.
Mr. A G. R. Shiel, Senior Lecturer
in Surgery at the University of Sydney,
who talked about organ transplants, said
Sydney had become the first city in
the world to offer a complete “cover”
of kidney transplants to suitable
patients. Sydney results were well above
the world average. In the past year,
two transplant units had implanted new
kidneys in 60 patients, and were treating
a further 51 by artificial kidney. It was
reckoned that in a city the size of
Sydney an average of 105 patients a
year would need such treatments.
Dealing with drug addiction in young
adults, Dr. C. M. Rosenberg, of the
Psychiatric Research Unit at Callan
Park Hospital, Sydney, reported on a
clinical and psychological survey he
made of 50 hospitalised alcoholics and
50 drug addicts, all 30 years or under.
It showed drug addicts tended to be
more intelligent than alcoholics, also
more sexually deviate, and more artistic.
The absence of “father-figures” seemed
to be the main causative agent in both
groups.
Dr. R W. Hornabrook talked about
kuru, a disease few of his colleagues
at the Congress are ever likely to
encounter first hand. A fatal muscular
condition which affects New Guinea
highlanders, he said it had been traced
to a virus transmitted by cannibalism,
one which is passed on when the flesh
of a sufferer is eaten. He said it had
appeared every ten years in the Goroka
area since 1910, but had been declining
rapidly since cannibalism was stamped
out in the 19505.
The nee d to attract more graduating
doctors to general practice was the
concern of Professor Clifford Jungfer,
President of the Australian College of
General Practitioners. “Every patient
in Australia is entitled to the services
of a general practitioner. I promise he
will get one,” he said.
Another view of the GP’s role, how-
ever, came later from Professor Miller,
from the University of Newcastle, Eng-
land, who said the GP, along with the
honorary doctor, and the present style
0 f hospital buildings, was “a historic
relic” and must be scrapped. In their
place must come hospitals with 2000
beds for each million of population,
employing specialists without private
practices who would be based at the
hospitals.
A determined effort was made to
have a competent discussion on Abori-
ginal problems, particularly those of
the 70,000 Aboriginal children in Aus-
tralia. Speakers included general prac-
titioners, an anthropologist, a profes-
sor D f psychology, and a staff sister from
the Darwin Health Department. Which
one let the AMA publicity department
issue the following statement on his
behalf, fortunately no one knows, as
he is unnamed:
“As to intellectual development
the doctor’s impression is that the
children, given a reasonably good family
environment, are not at all inferior on
the average to white children. ‘Many of-j
them are pretty smart,’ he says. ‘They*
do well at school, and some go from
primary to high school.’ ”
However there seems to have been
very little left unsaid at the Congress.
Someone touched on venereal disease in
Vietnam and Wing-Commander P.
Howard of the RAF held forth on the
physiological implications of weight-
lessness. The profile of an Apollo moon
flight was an Australian contribution
and “A Statistical Review of 500,000
Cervical Smears” using computer
analysis was also on the agenda,
After long exposure to the Congress,
one either began to feel rather poorly
or radiantly well. But even this is
suspect as Dr. P. J. White asked sig-
nificantly in his paper: “Who Are the
Well People?” Who, indeed?

The real cost of the Opera House
By SANDRA HALL
THERE IS fine symbolic irony in the
contrasting events of those two sagas
of the N.S.W. cultural scene: “The
Opera House: Will It Ever End?” and
“The Art Gallery of N.S.W. Faces
Life.”
They typify so well the mixture of
ignorance, caution, and suspicion that
has for so long characterised bureau-
cracy’s attitude to the arts in this
country. For years, Government admini-
stration has felt that culture is not
quite practical, something to be en-
couraged, of course, but as one of
life’s fringe benefits to be emphasised
only on special occasions like royal
visits.
Now the Opera House has turned
the tables on bureaucracy in N.S.W.,
making a gigantic and expensive black
joke out of its painstaking consideration
of practicalities. It is as if all vague
fears about that slippery, not-to-be-
trusted world of the arts had come true
in one terrible nightmare, because by
the time the Opera House is finished
we will have paid for little more than
beauty.
We knew, long ago, that we wouldn’t
be getting our money’s worth; then we
found out we wouldn’t even be getting
an opera house. Instead, there’ll be a
concert hall of hardly imposing dimen-
sions, an opera hall too small for
opera, and a theatre which isn’t large
enough for professional drama.
Meanwhile, the last Government’s
plan to build a new wing on to the
Art Gallery has been shelved by the
present Government, and the staff of
the Gallery struggle to conserve and
exhibit valuable pictures and sculpture
in an old and increasingly inadequate
building, a large part of which has
remained unfinished for about 60 years.
The Government’s neglect of the
Gallery is doubly ironic, because Aus-
tralian art has achieved the respect-
ability of being regarded as an invest-
ment.
The present Government allocates
$40,000 a year to the Gallery for its
purchases, a sum made ridiculous by
the fact that a Sydney dealer, Barry
Stern, recently placed two Australian
paintings on the market at $45,000
and $35,000. These prices were hardly
realistic, assisted as they were by
judicious publicity, but a highly
regarded Nolan or Drysdale does fetch
between $5OOO and $6OOO ordinarily,
while important pictures by inter-
national artists are well out of the
Gallery’s purchasing range.
“And, of course, it’s impossible for
us to buy an old master,” the president
of the Gallery’s Board of Trustees, Sir
Erik Langker, says, “so we have concen-
trated on trying to build up a good
Australian collection.” This becomes
increasingly difficult, he adds, as
prices on the Australian market con-
tinue to rise.
But the problems of acquisition are
minor alongside the Gallery staff’s
most difficult job, taking care of the
works already there. Dampness and
lack of exhibition and storage space
have become even more potent
enemies since the Government dropped
the plans for the new wing which
would have given the Gallery twice as
much hanging space as it has now,
together with new offices and storage
rooms.
The Trustees have led three depu-
tations to Government Ministers to
protest against the scheme’s abandon-
ment, gentlemanly confrontations in
which the Ministers assured the Trus-
tees that they understood the situation
very well and would do their best.
So far, the Minister for Education,
Mr. Cutler, who is also leader of the
Country Party, has given the Gallery
the means to re-establish its country
exhibitions and to employ an education
officer, a mixed blessing since more
exhibition space has been sacrificed
in order to accommodate his office.
The last deputation to the Minister
of Public Works, Mr. Davis Hughes,
was only a month ago, and the Trustees
are “still living in hope.” Sir Erik
says he believes the Government real-
ises the building “has got to come.”
“At the moment,” he said, “the
Gallery’s the poor child of the cultural
scene. The public library has had
additions, and so have the Museum and
the Conservatorium.”
Perhaps the Trustees’ strongly
critical annual report which has just
been published the first shot fired
in anger in the previously polite war
of words will have some effect,
but it’s doubtful.
Except for the Labor Government’s
approval of plans for the new building,
direct action on the part of any
government has hardly figured largely
in the Gallery’s complicated history.
It was pushed laboriously into
being in 1884, after 11 years of
wrangling over whether or not to
build, where to build, and, finally, what
to build. The building was completed
in 1909, although “completed” is a
euphemism, since half of it is still
in the condition then regarded as
“temporary.”
Dust and dirt accumulate in the old
“sawtooth” roofs, the timbers of which
are rotting, while the Gallery’s position,
overlooking the harbor, means there’s
a twin threat to the paintings from
moisture and ships’ fumes, which
change into damaging sulphur dioxide
on hitting the damp air.
Twenty-three years ago, when the
Gallery’s director, Hal Missingham.
took up his post, the lower courts,
then floored with cobblestones covered
in a composition material, regularly
filled with water whenever it rained.
At least that doesn’t happen any more,
but the cement floors laid by the
Department of Public Works began to
crack immediately they were finished.
A request for new equipment means
a sortie into that Kafka-like maze of
requisition forms familiar to employees
of any public department, and the
Gallery staff have learned never to

The lighting, number one considera-
tion in any self-respecting gallery, has
a hybrid quality (fittings of various
shapes and sizes mixed with fluorescent
bars) which reflects its Topsy-like
origins. A broken bulb may mean a
wait of several weeks for a replace-
ment via requisitions, so some bulbs
are always dark.
In an effort to bypass the red tape
of the requisition form, the Gallery
has, over the years, built up its own
workshop where showcases, cabinets,
and partitions are put together. Some
courts have been partitioned in an
effort to increase the exhibition space,
which is now so short that the Gal-
lery’s comprehensive collection of prints
and drawings can rarely be shown.
But storage is the ’most serious prob-
lem, since lack of room has actually
caused the ruin of some paintings. They
should be hung on wire racks in the
low-ceilinged storage rooms beneath
the exhibition courts, but the racks are
full, and rows of paintings are stacked
face to back against the walls. Dobell’s
portrait of Sir Robert Menzies rates
a place on a rack, but Sir Robert seems
to be surveying his surroundings with
long-nosed disdain. And well he might.
In these conditions, mould and fungus
flourish among the stacked pictures,
and, although the Gallery has gradu-
ally acquired a formidably equipped
conservation laboratory, some paintings
have become too severely pitted to be
saved.
The gallery conservator, Bill Bou-
stead, has been dealing with the effects
of mould on paintings for so long
that he was one of the most valuable
members of the team of restorers who
went from various countries to
Florence to try to save art works
damaged in the floods. Two de-
humidifying machines installed in the
storage rooms a few years ago suck a
constant stream of moisture out of the
atmosphere.
The Art Gallery is New South
Wales’ most spectacularly neglected
cultural building, but is not the only
one.
The Museum of Applied Arts and
Sciences was once promised a new wing,
for which it’s had a Godot-like wait.
It began in 1936, when there were plans
to give it extensions adding up to a
total of 200,000 square feet of exhibi-
tion space.
It still has its original 27,000 square
feet. In fact, the only direction in
which it has spread is to a warehouse
in the industrial suburb of Alexandria,
where horse-drawn buses, steam loco-
motives, and electric trolleys are shut
away with valuable textile exhibits
that have never been shown. Whether
they ever will be shown is another
imponderable.
In the business of culture, practical
people like the New South Wales Gov-
ernment seem automatically to become
ineffectual. Perhaps it’s their unfam-
iliarity with the medium.

IF ONE CAN BELIEVE
THE MOTORING EXPERTS
(AND WE DO) EACH OF
OUR THREE DIFFERENT
ROVER 2000'S IS THE
FINEST CAR IN
THE WORLD.
DOES THAT MAKE YOUR
CHOICE HARDER OR
EASIER?
You now have a choice of three Rover
2000’s: single carburettor (S.C.), twin car-
burettor (T.C.) and Automatic. Of our S.C.
model, “Wheels” says: “A magnificent
motor car that stands as the world’s finest
argument against the people who would
eliminate fast cars.” Of our T.C. model,
"Car and Driver” says: "We believe that
the Rover 2000 TC is absolutely the best
sedan that has ever been presented in the
pages of this magazine.” Of our Automatic
model, "Road Test” says: “Our previous
consensus that the Rover 2000 is amongst
the finest cars in the world is enhanced by
the addition of the Automatic.” At first sight
this plethora of praise may tend to make
your choice more difficult. But in fact it's
fairly straight sailing if you think of it like
this: The S.C. model costs the least and has
enough power (0-100 in 45 secs.) to keep
all but the most ardent enthusiasts purring.
It has so many safety features (about fifty)
that it consistently takes out the top safety
awards around the world. It has bucket
seats (both front and rear) which have been
called the most comfortable in the world,
with particular regard for the small of the
back. Other creature comforts include
genuine leather upholstery, wall-to-wall
carpeting and a virtuoso heating and ven-
tilating system. Plus, of course, typically
Rover-ish touches like an electric clock
and a steering wheel that adjusts up and
down to suit you. The road-holding and
braking of the 2000 SC are legendary, so
much so that the motoring writers of the
world are still inventing superlatives to
describe them. The T.C. model has all the
above plus an 18% lift in horsepower that
makes it a very hot motor car indeed. (It
also has a tachometer of the hero-driver
genre for the benefit of enthusiasts like
Jack Fury.) The Automatic, likewise, has all
the features of the S.C. model with the
added advantage of clutchless driving. (In
fact, you can drive this one either auto-
matically or manually.) Well, there it is. Now
all you need is an hour or so to test drive
the one that is you.

The sick Republic
ALL THE TALK one hears nowadays
about South-East Asia, and of regional
co-operation, helps obscure the fact
that it is an area of wide and some-
times incredible contrasts. There could
hardly be any greater contrast, for
example, than that between the tiny
sole surviving substantive sultanate of
Brunei and the sprawling effervescent
democracy of the Republic of the
Philippines. The first is physically, and
increasingly, a colony, but mentally it
obviously possesses a very independent
view of the world. Brunei is Brunei is
Brunei. The Philippines, on the other
hand, while way back at the turn of the
century it was the first Asian country
to struggle for, and after World War II
the first Asian country to receive its
independence, still shows clear signs of
being psychologically a colony. From
being first in the freedom struggle, it
has fallen back and back, until today,
with many of its Asian neighbors, it
scarcely counts at all.
The Filipinos have yet to clarify and
impersonalise to a greater extent
than other ex-colonies their relations
with their former colonialists. As a re-
sult, the rest of their relations with the
outside world are similarly indistinct
and nebulous. Filipino uncertainty as
to their Asian identity has produced,
as in the case of the Sabah claim dis-
pute, numerous aberrations in the
search after it. In short, the Philip-
pines is not yet the Philippines. Worse
than that, since the problem of
identity bedevils many other States, it
is difficult to see any clear and pat-
terned development toward such an
identity.
If arriving from Brunei stimulates
comparison, then departing from
Manila for Kuala Lumpur is similarly
provocative. After the constant and
frequent noise of political battles in
the Philippines, the general absence of
turmoil on the Malaysian political
scene is deafening. Filipino politics may
be almost certainly are full of
sound and fury, signifying nothing. The
only time there was some real sound
and fury in Malaysian politics, the
culprit, Singapore, was quickly ampu-
tated from the body politic.
Beyond that, Malaysia is sedate, the
Philippines mercurial. Malaysia was not
only the last Asian country to become
independent after World War 11, it
was also the only one wherein, after
the war, the colonialists firmly and
emphatically re-established themselves
and their concepts of law and order.
The Philippines became independent
before the ravages of the war had been
repaired, the Americans preferring,
unlike the British, to remain true to
their anti-colonial professions rather
than to any more prosaic calculations.
Curiously, and as an example of the
fact that for the Americans in the
Philippines it is quite difficult to do
anything right, this failure has been the
subject of resentment ever since, in that
the Filipinos contrast what was done
to put the Japanese on their postwar
feet with what was not done for them.
But whether colonialism reimposed
would have been either practicable or
acceptable in 1946 is doubtful. Whether
it would have made any difference to
the Philippines’ development is like-
wise questionable. The point is that in
the Malaysian experience, the imposi-
tion and maintenance of law and order
has been a central fact. In the Philip-
pines both colonialists and colonised
concentrated more upon the imposition
and maintenance of the democratic
values.
For both the United States and the
Republic of the Philippines “peace and
order” is now a central unsolved prob-
lem in the Philippines it is, curi-
ously, but perhaps significantly, “peace
and order” which is dreamed about,
not “law and order.”
There can be no argument about the
Philippines being, with the possible
exception of India, the most articulate,
the most eloquent, the most verbal
democracy in Asia. One has to experi-
ence the flow of words to believe it,
and after that experience countries
like Malaysia and Singapore seem ter-
ribly quiet all of a sudden.
The first impression one gets in the
Philippines is that there are no prob-
lems which are not discussed avidly
and forcefully. The columns in the
newspapers, the speeches in -the Con-
gress, the Press statements of the
politicians in a country where there
are plenty of them the pontifications
of the columnists ... all these immedi-
ately produce a very favorable effect.
But as time goes by one begins to
wonder. Democratic theory has it, after
all, that the availability of freedom
means that problems freely discussed
will be the sooner solved. It does not
take long to realise that in the R.P.
there is no such correlation. Cynically
one begins to wonder if words have,
instead, become a means for creating
the illusion of action or even for avoid-
ing it altogether. Certainly in the end,
lest the words confuse, one looks the
more warily at them. Slowly but surely,
it seems that the Philippines is sinking
beneath a plethora of words and a
paucity of deeds.
If the eloquence seemingly solves
few problems and may even be
counter-productive the fact remains
that they very often well describe the
reality. Two and a half years ago,
upon his inauguration, President
Ferdinand Marcos electrified 34,000,000
Filipinos with words that still seem
very apposite today. So much so that
one can only wonder if Marcos
occasionally has sleepless nights won-
dering how devastatingly his inaugural
could be used against him when he
comes up for re-election next year.
Some progress has been registered since
then, to be sure, but insufficient to
alter the broad outlines of the reality
the President then described.
“. . . we must hasten our social and
economic transformation. For today, the
Filipino, it seems, has lost his soul, his
dignity, and his courage. We have come
upon a phase of our history when ideals
are only a veneer for greed and power
in public affairs, when devotion to duty
and dedication to a public trust are to
be weighed at all times against private
advantages and personal gain, and when
loyalties can be traded in the open mar-
ket. Our people have come to a point
of despair ... I know the face of des-
pair and I know the face of hunger,
because I have seen it in our barrios
“We are in crisis ” Marcos
told the nation when he was
elected (r.) on a platform
of reform. Today the situation
is no better
(village) huts and hovels all over our
land. We have ceased to value order as
a social virtue. Law we have learned
successfully to flaunt. We have become
past masters at devising slogans for the
sake of recorders of history, but not for
those who would live by them in terms
of honor and dignity ... we cannot
even guarantee life and limb in our
growing cities. Prosperity for all, we
promise. But only a privileged few
achieve it and . . . parade their com-
forts and advantages before the eyes
of an impoverished many . . . our Gov-
ernment is gripped in the iron hand
of venality, its Treasury is barren, its
resources are wasted, its Civil Service
is slothful and indifferent, its Armed
Forces demoralised, and its councils
sterile . . . We are in crisis.”
The President then went on to detail
the crisis even more fully the
Government’s indebtedness and im-
poverishment, industries at a standstill,
rising unemployment, rising prices,
conspicuous consumption. “One of the
most galling of our inherited problems


By HARVEY STOCKWIN
is that of lawlessness . . . the demo-
cratic rule of law has lost all meaning
. . . since all men know that public
officials combine with unscrupulous
businessmen to defraud the Govern-
ment with absolute impunity . . .
the lawless elements, the smuggling
syndicates and their protectors, disavow
the power of laws and of our Govern-
ment over them. This is the climate for
criminality. Popular faith in the Gov-
ernment deteriorates. We must there-
fore aim quickly at the establishment
of a genuine rule of law ... we shall
have to restore into our life the vitality
which has been eroded by our com-
placency . . . This nation can be great
again . . .”
Mere rhetoric? Devised itself more
for history and effect than as a state-
ment of cause and purpose? Certainly,
it had impact at the time, though one
suspects more in American magazines
than it had at home. But today it
would merely seem to have taken its
place in the bulky volume of Filipino
oratory. Columnists refer to it cyni-
cally as “that great-again speech” and
the cynicism itself seems to indicate a
belief that the situation the President
then described not only continues, but
is greater than the capacity of the
system to correct.
To be fair to Marcos, he was speak-
ing at a time when an outgoing ad-
ministration had made the most of its
last few months in office and after a
period when there had been a few
scandals sufficient to boggle even the
Filipino imagination, inured as it is to
scandal. Since then a degree of effec-
tiveness has been restored to govern-
ment, some stability to the finances
(largely due to the old friends, the
Americans), and Marcos has tried hard
according to some sources, success-
fully to make the Republic self-
sufficient in rice.
First and last, democratic politics in
the Philippines serve to divert the nation
rather than to direct it. In a speech to
a university audience last year Marcos
claimed he had diminished politics “in
the conduct of the affairs of govern-
ment.” He then went on to describe
the situation which, for this observer,
continues to exist. “By politics I mean
the petty bickerings, the senseless power-
plays, the currying after favors that
occupy most of the waking hours of our
legislators, Government officials, and
even Government employees.” The
President confessed himself to being
“tired of this kind of politics,” and
knew “our people are tired of it, too.”
The hard fact remains that even in and
around Malacanang (the Presidential
palace) such politicking abounds, as
everywhere else, despite the Presidential
description of it as “a meaningless and
wasteful pantomime.” And abounds to
the exclusion of constructive work and
activity—lest you point out that in the
Australian club pr office politics also
play their part. Whereas one would
expect a Government department’s
function to continue alongside whatever
politicking is considered necessary by
individuals, in the Philippines it appears
that whatsoever action there is is the
result of political manoeuvring. The
Sabah-claim dispute for example relates,
in part, to the jealousies and manoeuv-
rings within the Filipino Department
of Foreign Affairs rather than to any
hard and straight thinking on whether
or not the claim was worth pursuing in
the light of the Philippines’ national
self-interest.
So whether or not the participants are
tired of politics or not —it would appear
not since the" game is played with such
zest the pantomime continues. Take
the preparations and calculations
already under way for the 1969 Presi-
dential election. While Marcos fought
and won last year’s Senatorial cam-
paign on the basis of “let us continue,”
the underlying reality was, and is, “let
us continue to seek re-election.”
On the surface, the President scored
a sufficient victory for him to be able
to rest assured of re-election and there-
fore to be able to put politicking aside
for the time being. But Filipino poli-
tics doesn’t work that way. The
political atmosphere is heavy with in-
trigue and manoeuvre largely devoid of
any ideological or constructive con-
tent. This atmosphere would seem to
ensnare all Filipino politicians within its
grasp, making the capacity for detach-
ment or detached action all but im-
possible. Certainly, Marcos hasn’t got
it. His saving grace is that he is a
better intriguer than most.
Theoretically President Marcos ob-
tained control of the Senate last year
and succeeded in getting many of his
Nacionalista followers elected as pro-
vincial governors and local mayors. As
things have turned out, the advantage
was more apparent than real. So far
this year it has been tough sledding
for Marcos in the Senate, and even a
special Congressional session has not
yielded very positive results. The
President has talked about calling yet
another additional session, but even that
would get only a fraction of his pro-
gram passed. This program, notably the
Presidential proposals for increasing
and changing the taxes, has run foul of
the fact that in practice the Senators
and the Congressmen either represent
the interests of the wealthy few or are
seeking to become part of the wealthy"
few. They are, therefore, scarcely
attuned to programs, however well
meaning, that may benefit the under-
privileged many though Bills which
increase their pork-barrel capacity
usually get passed even if the
projects are sometimes of dubious
economic merit. And, again, while
Marcos was undoubtedly more suc-
cessful with the gubernatorial and
mayorality results than his immedi-
ate predecessors at Malacanang, the
difference was only of degree. At
midterm there is only one place to go-
— on to the Presidential bandwagon
and into the Presidential pork barrel.
Marcos’ “victory” may yet be a liability,
despite his undoubted capacity for
handling power and power seekers,
simply because he has the more “fol-
lowers,” to placate, themselves only
governed by opportunist criteria. Their
support, come 1969, is far from assured.
In short, the Filipino political pro-
cess would seem to stagger on from
expediency to adjustment, from calcu-
lation to conspiracy, which makes it
virtually impossible for the problems
outlined by Marcos in his eloquent
inaugural to be rectified. Politicians
work to satisfy, with favors, their rela-
tives and their constituents usually
in that order. But this scarcely helps
Filipinos to “rise from the depths of
ignominy and failure.”
Perhaps the ease with which Marcos*
inaugural (unlike Kennedy’s) has been
forgotten is accounted for by the fact
that what he then insisted must be
done was seen by the majority of this
very cynical population as something
the system could not do.


BUSINESS
AND THE ECONOMY
Psychological manoeuvres
and economic nonsense
IN CANBERRA last week Treasury
officials readily admitted that the
Budget was framed as much for its
psychological, as for its direct economic
effects. It is certainly much more
deflationary than the state of the
economy justifies.
The Treasury in its annual pre-
Budget survey of the economy had
said: “Although demand gained
strength through 1967-68 it has not
caused serious strains in the labor
market or on domestic resources gen-
erally.” On this basis it was predicted
that the Budget would be rather neutral
in its effect, allowing growth in the
private sector to run on smoothly by
putting as much into the spending
streams of the economy as it took out
in taxation.
But the Treasurer, while introducing
the unexpected tax rises, pointed out
that it seemed “prudent to modify a
little the stimulus flowing from the
increase in (Commonwealth) expendi-
ture by seeking at least a modest addi-
tion to our revenue resources.”
In considering how best to achieve
these additions, the Government has to
bear in mind the psychological game
it plays with two independent, unpre-
dictable groups of people if its economic
policies are to work: the members of
the Arbitration Commission and foreign
money market speculators. It is
unanimous in its belief that the Arbi-
tration Commission has been contribut-
ing heavily to inflation by awarding
wage rises far in excess of the produc-
tivity performance of the economy. So
the Treasurer wanted to impress the
Commission with his seriousness by
making the Budget a tough one. But to
demonstrate that the Government is not
on the side of business and against the
workers, it placed the great burden of
extra taxes squarely on companies. It
is determined to avoid the accusation
before the Arbitration Commission that
by opposing any increase in wages, it is
thereby on the side of the employers.
The overseas investors are a large
but as yet unmeasured force in the land.
Only the preliminary figures for capital
inflow have been issued so far by the
Commonwealth Statistician (The Bulle-
tin, August 10) and these put “port-
folio investments and institutional
loans” at $4OO million and a “balancing
item” at $493 million.
From such figures some supposedly
informed sources have been suggesting
that much more than $4OO million of
foreign capital could have been brought
into Australia and put into shares—one
source puts it closer to $BOO million.
That is an exaggeration. But such
capital inflow is potentially “hot money”
which could flow out rapidly if there
were any crisis of confidence in the
Australian dollar.
The Government is optimistic about
the balance of trade next year: a gigan-
tic wheat harvest is well on the way,
and, together with increased mineral
exports, our earnings abroad should, in
the Treasury view, improve by $5OO
million. “On this kind of reckoning,”
said the Treasury in its survey, “exports
and imports should be much closer to
balance than in the year just past,” and
the deficit on current account should
be “significantly below” the 1967-68
level But the Government isn’t taking
any chances with the balance of pay-
ments. And that was another unexpected
factor in Budget thinking.
The actual mix of tax measures is
probably better explained by these psy-
chological and political factors than by
economic needs. The actual state of the
economy would suggest that any spend-
ing restraint should be imposed on the
motorist and the housebuilder. Both
motor-vehicle sales and housing con-
struction are at an extraordinarily
high level, and it would have
made economic sense to increase
sales tax on cars or petrol and
to use monetary measures to cut housing
activity back somewhat.
Certainly the increased tax on com-
pany income doesn’t make any sense
at all, in economic terms. One of the
few lagging sectors of the economy is
business capital spending, and retained
profits are an important element in
financing this. To hit company profits
is to hit business capital spending,
which is the basis for economic growth.
CARGO HANDLING
EFFICIENT STEVEDORES
ANNUAL REPORT season is about to
burst on us once again. The first report
to be tabled in the Federal Parliament
was from the Australian Stevedoring
Industry Authority.
The Authority reported that the ton-
nage of cargo handled by Australian
ports increased by 12 percent, while
man-hours worked fell by 5 percent. If
this is not quite the phenomenal increase
in productivity which simple arithmetic
suggests —some of it was due to a shift
in the cargo mix toward bulk-handled
Treasurer McMahon — prudent?
goods it does suggest a good increase
in efficiency.
Man-hours lost through strikes num-
bered 99,336, a vast improvement on
the 500,000 to 1,200,000 which was
common before permanency of employ-
ment was introduced. It appears that
Mr. McMahon’s reforms have been tre-
mendously successful in reducing indus-
trial strife and increasing productivity
into the bargain.
The report says it has been shown
that marginal improvements are pos-
sible with conventional vessels by
rationalising services to major ports and
by the use of more efficient stevedoring
techniques. However, freight rate
increases can only be retarded but not
halted by these means and the only
adequate counter to rising costs is for
substantially improved rates at which
cargo is handled, thereby reducing a
vessel’s stay in port, which, in turn,
would enable a greater number of
voyages to be made.
With new methods, says the report,,
berth utilisation will increase greatly.
Where a conventional berth today may
handle between 100,000 and 150,000
tons of general cargo per year, a unit-
load berth can increase this to 500,000
tons and a container berth to one million
tons. It can be seen that an annual
trade of, say, 5 million tons at present
requiring 50 berths may be accommo-
dated by one container berth plus six
unit-load berths or two container
berths and two unit-load berths, if we
take these figures to their logical
extremes.
It is also apparent to the stevedores
that the waterfront labor force will be-
subjected to drastic change. Conven-
tional vessels require five gangs of 15
to 21 men to handle about 500 tons
of cargo in each shift. Unit-load ships,
when used efficiently, need five gangs
of eight or nine men to handle up to-
about 1500 tons in each shift. While,
based on overseas experience, container
ships will need two smaller gangs to
move up to 6000 tons per shift.


U.K. BRAINS
NEW DRAIN?
PHYSICALLY and technically the Aus-
tralian mining industry is undergoing
unprecedented expansion. At the sa!me
time, the mining engineers, whose skills
carry the boom, have swelled their
ranks by a remarkable nine men to
a current 450 since 1961.
Speaking at the annual conference
of the Australasian Institute of Mining
and Metallurgy at Broken Hill last
week, Professor Morgan, head of the
school of Mining Engineering at the
University of New South Wales, put
the current national requirement at
3000 mining engineers. The plea was
once again for more training facilities
at least six university schools for
training and research in mining engin-
eering, and at least three centres for
specialised training.
But that is for the long-term. To
help satisfy immediate needs Professor
Morgan wondered whether recruit-
ment through immigration couldn’t be
doing more. It probably could, par-
ticularly now the change in U.S.
immigration policy has turned from
skimming the cream off the U.K.
immigrant sources, giving preference
to “blood relatives” rather than “needed
skills.” That is, at least, what London’s
“Sunday Times” believes as it pre-
pares to issue a recruitment supple-
ment on Australian industry, mid-
September, intent, as it were, on sup-
porting the U.K. “brain drain” at pre-
vious levels.
From the U.K. last year 84,000
migrants came to Australia, 64,000
went to Canada, 34,000 to the U.S.,
and 15,000 to New Zealand. Of the
209,000 souls involved, 6200 were in
the scientist - engineer - technologist
group, and although the statistics do
not elucidate the matter any further,
it is reasonable to assume that the U.S.
received more than its share of those.
Although some with “blood relatives”
there, will still be going to the U.S.
and a few others will be prepared to
join the estimated waiting
list to be accepted under the “needed
skills” classification, a considerable
number will remain to be channelled
off elsewhere. Will Australia provide
the major outlet?
According to the “Sunday Times,”
it will, provided the extra recruiting
efforts are made: Australia has a grow-
ing economy compared with varying
degrees of recession in both Canada
and New Zealand; cost of living is
reasonably comparable (it is said to be
cheaper to live in Melbourne than in
London); and potential salaries in many
fields are much higher.
Assuming the theory of supply and
demand, the comparative salary figures
give some interesting insights into Aus-
tralia’s particular professional weak-
nesses, the biggest gaps being in man-
agement and work studies, where
consultants in Australia can hope for a
salary at the £6500 level, compared
with £2525 in the U.K.; medicine,
MEN AND MATTERS
PRINTING IS MORE of an art in
Australia than the manufacture of print-
ing machines, whose supply over the
years has been furnished mainly from
overseas companies operating here on
an agency basis. Probably the best
known of these is Seligson and Clare,
originally controlled by a South African
group of the same name and now the
main subsidiary of Aldus Ltd., whose
present chairman, James Cook, got hold
of it just before the war on the death of
the South African partners. Before that,
Cook had been at Melbourne Gram-
mar and had followed his father and
grandfather into Alexander Cowan of
which his grandfather had been the
first general manager in Melbourne.
(His great grandfather was the pub-
lisher of a provincial newspaper in
Scotland, so the print business was
clearly in the blood.) The war, in which
he was ultimately major commanding
the 172nd light anti-aircraft battery in
New Guinea, rudely postponed Cook’s
plans for the development of Seligson
and Clare, and at the end of it, his only
aide in the agency was a secretary-
typist.
Mr. Cook worked hard and fast, and
in favorable conditions for the rapid
growth of the business. The excellence
of the equipment, for which he had
agencies from leading British, European,
U.S. manufacturers, helped, and Selig-
son and Clare became a byword in the
trade in Australia. Mr. Cook’s expan-
sionary bent found further expression
in the formation of a holding company,
Aldus, in 1954, and this was floated four
years later. Since then the group has
branched out in several directions, both
in new agency business and manufactur-
ing, two of the biggest acquisitions in
recent years being Royal Engineering
and Tumely Photo Process Equipment,
both engineering proprietaries. Through
the subsidiary Herbert Osborne, a big
agency business is conducted in machine
tools and general merchandise.
This build-up has seen Mr. Cook well
through his tasks as chief executive and
he relinquished this job six years ago,
since when he’s been chairman only.
One of his main interests is to improve
the standard of printing in Australia and
he has seen to it that most of the print-
ing schools here are provided with the
latest equipment. His annual award to
Victoria Press Association for work
based on production merit is highly
prized by its winners.
THE NEWS THAT Playtex (Aus-
tralia) Pty. Ltd. will spend $1 million
in advertising in 1968-69 makes it a
historic year for softgoods, and should
make the other makers of bras and
girdles sit up and take notice.
Playtex spent about $1,375,000 total
in the previous three years, which was
more than the entire industry had spent
on advertising before. Its usage of tele-
vision for almost the whole budget,
despite the nature of the apparel adver-
tised, was so successful that other foun-
dation-garment makers had to follow
suit, use television, and expand their
budgets. Berlei has launched its biggest
advertising campaign recently with 3300
TV spots from July through to Decem-
ber, but Playtex already uses TV at
the rate of 12,000 spots a year.
Though 1968 figures for Playtex are
not yet filed with the companies office,,
managing-director Jack Detlefs reported
a 24 percent increase in operating profit
before tax and licence fees to the U.S.
parent. This was from a 16 percent
turnover increase, and the result was
the first fair measure of progress of his
company in the four years of its Aus-
tralian operations; for 1967-68 was the
first period in which there was no terri-
torial expansion. Playtex is looking for
a 25 percent sales increase this current
year from its heavier advertising.
Only slightly embarrassed by the 14-
James Cook
Jack Detlefs
foot bra which workmen had engin-
eered and playfully erected in his
Auburn (N.S.W.) office, Detlefs, an
American, said the latest year’s profit
progress was restricted by production
limitations. The company is thinking in
terms of a new plant and fresh ware-
house space by 1970. Already the pro-
duction is separated into die cutting at
Silverwater and sewing and make-up at
Auburn, about a mile away,
Australia is Detlefs first permanent
assignment overseas for International
Playtex, a subsidiary of the Glen Alden
Corporation, and he does not know
how W , h . is term wlb be - After f ° ur
years in this country he can say that
the bl §S est frustration in business and
domestic affairs was to adjust to long
delivery times. Although he finds it
difficult to get things done here in the
time he allots, Playtex (Australia) is,
after years’ operations, where the
company expected to be in five years,
Detlefs has been with International
p laytex for 20 years since he was
demobbed from the U.S. Army after
service in the infantry in Europe. He
began in the finance end of the firm,
and went over to distribution and manu-
facturing, then into sales and marketing,
He worked with the company in New
York, Delaware, and Missouri.


£7466 and £4000; barristers £5600 and
£3000; town planners £2283 and £1250.
Most classes of engineers, physicists,,
agricultural scientists, geologists, metal-
lurgists, and land surveyors all have
greater monetary recognition in Aus-
tralia. But civil engineers, dentists,
pharmacists, and quantity surveyors
would all do much better by staying
away.
Mining engineers, geologists, and
metallurgists receive £2274 in class I of
the Public Service Board compared with
£l5OO for an equivalent grade in the
U.K. The difference is substantial. But
considering the somewhat desperate need
pointed out by Professor Morgan, and
the relative scarcity of the species both
here and in the U.K., the salary is
probably not attractive enough.
The estimated stock of qualified min-
ing engineers in the U.K. is put at about
4100, of which only five emigrated
last year. With or without a change in
U.S. immigration policy, the potential
for attracting more of them to Australia
seems very small indeed. Much more
attractive salary scales would, no doubt,
help a little to fill the present gap. But
immigration policies and brain drains
are only essential expedients. And the
problem is how to fill the mining and
any other industry with home-grown
professionals.
Speculator’s Diary
TAKING A TIP FROM
THE MINISTER
ON PHOSPHATE ROCK
THE STOCK EXCHANGES in
O’Connell Street and Collins Street last
week were about as active as the finan-
cial pulse of London, which was on holi-
days over the bank-holiday season.
Many brokers I know heaved more than
a sigh of relief when London buying
resumed with a punch and our markets
accordingly took heart.
In fact, it was interesting to com-
pare thoughts on Wednesday as to the
relative effects of “London buying” and
the Federal Budget on the stock mar-
ket. The former won hands down as
being considered the most influential.
Almost obscured by the mass of
material on the Budget in the Press
on Wednesday morning was a state-
ment by the Minister for National
Development that Australia had to im-
port $285 million worth of minerals,
including petroleum and phosphate
rock, in 1967 because supplies were not
yet available in Australia. Continuing,
Mr. Fairbairn listed the main minerals
yet to be located in Australia to make
the country less dependent on imports
as asbestos, diamonds, petroleum, potas-
sium, and sulphur. Missing was phos-
phate.
This was good enough for me, and I
immediately added 100 Broken Hill
South to my portfolio. South’s
announced its extensive North Queens-
land phosphate discoveries some time
ago and its comments on the eventual
commercial exploitation of the deposits
have grown increasingly optimistic in
successive announcements. The chair-
man, Sir Lindesay Clark, a man with
good reason for an optimistic coun-
tenance yet not prone to overstatement,
said he believed the project would
eventually be of Hamersley dimen-
sions. A perusal of the “Positions
Vacant” columns a month or so back
would also indicate that South’s was
serious.
One vital factor for the project will
be the cost of capital, and it may be
that the Australian Resources Develop-
ment Bank can show its value to Aus-
tralia in this exercise. It may also be
one reason why South’s has kept its
hand well covered. I’ll even be sympa-
thetic to a substantial premium on the
company’s promised issue in the near
future in view of the long-term nature
of the project.
I believe South’s is another example
of a top-quality stock in the specula-
tive area still available at attractive
levels, as I commented last week with
reference to BHP and Western Mining.
The mining scene continues to blos-
som in the West. Whilst they will never
be in the high-flying class the shares
of the two Collie coal miners, Griffin
Coal and Western Collieries, look
rather anomolous on the Perth mining
boards showing the generous dividend
yields that they do. I’ve settled on
Western for my money, with a dividend
yield of over seven percent twice
covered by profits, and, unlike Griffin,
the company has been paying near
“normal” taxation.
Collie coal is sub-bitumenous and of
reasonably low calorific value, not suit-
able for coking purposes. However,
continued expansion of the Muja power-
station has guaranteed the two oper-
ators increasing markets. Moreover,
they have expressed optimism of gain-
ing a share of markets for such pro-
jects as Western Titanium’s ilmenite
beneficiation plant and even for pro-
cessing of iron ores in the North-West.
The most exciting prize that Western
Collieries is seeking is a doubling of
production by exporting up to half a
million tons of coal per year to Japan.
A formal agreement was recently signed
with Sumitomo Shoji Kaisha Ltd., of
Japan, to make a joint feasibility study
for the purpose of establishing such a
trade. Samples tested over a twelve-
month period had proven chemically
suitable, although a number of prob-
lems remained. These developments
demonstrate the fascinating variety of
uses of coal, as the principal interest is
understood to be for use as a fertiliser
and soil conditioner, after nitrogen
enrichment. Another use is in the pro-
duction of carbon after reduction of
coal at low temperature to char.
The shares seem an excellent each-
way bet. I bought a thousand.
To pay for my two new purchases
I decided to take my profits in Trade
Credits, which yielded a profit of $l5O,
the Brooker rights I had left over $3B,
Waltons $9l, Frigrite $23, and Nock
and Kirby $3B.
This leaves kitty at $252.

THE BUDGET
BUSINESS CHEER
BUSINESS NEED NOT be despondent
about the Budget. It contains a number-
of features which offer encouragement.
For one thing it may not turn out to
be quite as deflationary as its simple
arithmetic of the $lB9 million reduction
in the deficit suggests. What the Govern-
ment is spending this year will probably
find its way into the economy more
quickly than last, and it may have
larger multiplier effects because of its
welfare orientation.
One stimulating factor should be the
higher migrant intake which the
Government is confident of achieving—
the budgetary vote for migration is uj>
30 percent this year. The Department
hopes to attract 160,000 settlers.
Its efforts to revive flagging European
migration have already shown good
results, the number of assisted passage
migrants rising from 15,535 to 26,657
last year and an expected 33,500 this.
But it is the British who are arriving
in droves.
Applications for migration to Aus-
tralia have been rising steadily through-
out this year and the Department hopes
for at least 70,000 assisted Britons, com-
pared to 56,000 in 1967.
About 55,000 fare-paying settlers are
also expected to arrive.
Since migrants in their first years
contribute more to spending than they
do to production, they are a stimulating
factor in the economy. So if success-
ful, the Government’s expanded
immigration program will be a bullish
factor for business.

The economy: Mr. McMahon’s Budget was mildly
expansionary, with payments to industry up 21 percent,
8 percent more for social services and repatriation,
7 percent more for the States’ and the Commonwealth’s own
expenditures, 14 percent more for external aid, and
9 percent more for defence. Company tax rose 2J percent
to 45c in the $, sales tax 2£ percent to 15 percent.
Pensioners get about $1 more. Air travel will be more
expensive, and broadcasting and TV licences. Farmers score

Associated Securities, Mr. L. Patterson.
The markets: Australian share markets emerged quietly
confident from Budget week. Industrials strengthened,
some nickels zoomed, and the oil market looked healthier
than for weeks.
Front-runners among the nickels were Norseman (up $3
to $11.50), Ravensthorpe (up 60c to $3.40), and Great
Boulder, which gathered $1.60 to finish at $17.20. Vam moved

THE LAND
More handouts for farmers
Dairying: from bad to worse since devaluation
WHILE NOT SAYING precisely how
far the Goverriment has got with the
much-trumpeted review of its rural
policies, the Budget certainly shows that
farmers and their viability are much
on its mind. Altogether, its handouts
to them increased by 25 percent to $179
million this financial year. This is a
bigger percentage rise than to any other
section of the community. On top of
that, farmers are to have a Government'
security all of their own in the shape
of drought bonds. Against this, of
course, farming co'mpanies will, like all
other companies, have to pay the extra
2\ percent on company tax, and also
will be hit by higher (up from to
15 percent) sales tax on commercial
vehicles and spare automotive parts.
The latter tax increases stem partly
from the Treasurer’s estimation that,
prices and quantities permitting, there’s
going to be a substantial rise in farm
income this year. He argued that this,
coupled with expected buoyancy in
spending and investment generally, will
require so'me fiscal braking to prevent
an overspill of demand on to prices
generally, leading to higher demand for
imports, with possible adverse reper-
cussions on the balance of payments.
The farmers’ appetite for drought
bonds has yet to be tested. At this stage,
when precise details about them have
yet to be announced, it seems their
main attraction will lie in their initial
income-tax-deferment facility. This
should be a great boon, for instance, to
Victorian "and South Australian farmers
scraping the barrel for funds to finance
restocking, now the drought in those
two States is over. The other side of
this is that the tax saved in the year
of purchase will have to be paid on
the redemption of the bonds, and this
could cotae at the most awkward time
for the holders. Naturally, as the
Treasurer stated in the Budget speech,
the bonds will carry interest, though
the rate itself will be all-important, as
will the period the bonds must be held
before redemption. The rate and the
qualifying term before redemption will
have to be geared to the overall yield-
structure of Government and semi-
Government securities, despite the fact
that there will be no market in the
bonds, which will, as at present en-
visaged, only be transferable on the sale
of the holder’s property to which they
are tied.
If the bonds prove attractive to
farmers (and especially big agricul-
tural and pastoral companies), this
should provide a useful supplement to
other Government loan-raising media
in a year when the Treasurer has again
been obliged to rely heavily on the
banking system to bridge his overall gap
between revenue and expenditure.
The Budget’s revelation that $43
million, or aibout a quarter of the $176
million it provides for the rural sector,
will be needed to meet deficiences in
the wheat-stabilisation fund this year
underlines the importance of the stand
taken up by the Government to de-
liberalise the guarantee arrangements
in the new wheat-stabilisation agree-
ment. This amount is over and above
the $23 million payable to the wheat
industry via the Australian Wheat
Board in compensation for devaluation
losses. The $23 million is part of the
$57 million that the Government is
providing rural industries for devalua-
tion losses. The sugar industry was
awarded $6.8 million of this last week
to compensate its losses on 1967 and
1968 export sales, while the week
before $14.3 million was allotted to the
dairying, canned-fruit, egg, and honey
industries for the same reason. Put
alongside the mere $2 million Mr.
McMahon announced in the Budget
to compensate manufacturers for their
devaluation losses, these are handsome
sums.
Clearly the rural industries are being
well looked after in actual budget hand-
outs. For the dairying industry these
include, of course, the unchanged rate
of subsidy on top of devaluation losses.
However, the dairying industry, for one,
has gone from bad to worse since the
devaluation of sterling. The signs are
that slashing its prices on the British
market in whirlwind selling campaigns
is not likely to provide the answer to
its troubles. This was obvious from the
remarks of the chairman of the Dairy-
ing Committee of the Victorian Farmers’
Union last week when highlighting the
present crisis and long-term problems
of the industry.
For farmers generally, the Treasurer
has also gone out of his way to help in
increasing the subsidies on fertilisers
despite, in some instances, their prices
having recently been reduced by com-
panies of their own accord (in July the
price of superphosphate was cut by
ICIANZ, Cresco, and Pivot, and last
week Pivot also slashed the price of
sulphate of ammonia), and despite the
general intensification of competition on
all sides of the fertiliser industry. The
subsidies on superphosphate, first intro-
duced five years ago (now increased
from $6 to $8) and more recently on
nitrogenous fertilisers, have greatly
increased consumption of both, but at
high expense to the Treasury, whose
bill for them this year goes up by $l7
million to $5l million.
AGRISEARCH
MANY MOUTHS TO FEED
ROME HAS SPOKEN and the con-
troversy surrounding contraception,
population control, and food supply
and demand has broken out with re-
newed vigor. Paul Vi’s pronounce-
ment primarily concerns the moral
aspects of the “pill” and other artificial
methods of contraception. Out of this,
professional and amateur theologians
have been able to raise up a rich crop
of casuistic issues. But the farmers,
faced with the serious business of filling
stomachs from silos, must heed only the
facts and to hell with the sophistry.
One school of protagonists in the
debate seems to equate contraception
and population control. This piece of
foolishness will amuse farmers, who
often use contraception for the express
purpose of increasing the reproductive
efficiency of their flocks. Their use of
sterilised rams is one example that
comes immediately to mind. It should
also be noted that demographers have
shrewdly refrained from entering the
fray. A year or so ago, Professor W. D.
Borrie, Demographic Department, Re-
search School of Social Studies at the
National University, Canberra, ex-
plained that Australia’s declining birth
rate could not be attributed to artificial
contraception, despite the fact that
Australian women were the world’s
greatest consumers of the “pill.”
Bombay City has had an energetic
birth-control program for many years,
with free supplies of contraceptives
and certain rewards offered to partici-
pants, but the birth rate at 34 per
1000 is now higher than it ever was.
South Korea provides another example.

After pursuing an active birth-control
policy with government sponsorship
for almost a decade, a stock-taking study
of progress was carried out last year.
Its conclusion was that the effort so
far has been to delay rather than hasten
a decline in reproduction which various
social and economic forces are tending
to induce. Such seemingly contrary
consequences cause farmers no surprise.
They have long appreciated that they
must first exercise close control over
breeding if their animal enterprise is
to be successful. The notoriously low
productivity of our northern cattle
industry is due primarily to the uncon-
trolled mating resulting from lack of
fences and the large number of cattle
that have avoided muster and subjection
to contraceptive measures.
Taiwan is usually presented as the
showpiece in Asia to illustrate the
effect of family planning, as the
misguided efforts to attain population
control are euphemistically called.
Birth-control clinics dispensing free
contraceptives and advice were set up
about a decade ago. The campaign
has managed to contact and secure
the co-operation of a surprisingly high
proportion of the island’s young women,
and some decline in the average size
of the families has been achieved. But
once again the population increase has
not been checked.
Studies of a related type conducted
in Tunisia, Java, India, and several
Latin-American countries show that
women in all these places want 4 to
4.5 children. Only in the largest cities
are they inclined to settle for less. Where
contraceptives are readily available, the
number of children born invariably
exceeds the desired number. Thus, in
seven South American capitals the
women aimed at having 3.4 babies, but
ended up with 3.7. Families of this size,
sustained by ever-improving health ser-
vices, ensure that the world’s total popu-
lation must continue its upward spiral.
Clearly, our farmers and their sons
and their sons’ sons can close their
ears to a lot of silly talk and must bend
to the awesome job before them. A
first task to push on with all possible
speed is the development of rice growing
in the Burdekin Valley in Queensland.
An FAO study group on rice, looking
ahead until 1980, concluded recently
that the market demand for rice will
continue to outrun supply. Accordingly,
it forecasts a steady upward trend in
world prices for this cereal—the staple
food of one-third of the world’s people.
The price rise is already under way and
the value of rice on the international
market has changed its competitive
relationship with other cereal grains.
Two years ago the value of a
ton of brown rice was equal to
that of about two tons of wheat;
today, it is worth nearly three tons of
wheat. Pilot-scale plantings of Blue
Bonnet indicate that this is a reliable
and high-yielding variety in the Bur-
dekin Valley, and suggest that Queens-
land could ultimately eclipse New South
Wales as Australia’s major rice-growing
State.

THE HIDDEN WEALTH
WHO WILLTAP IT ?
...rural ‘cost squeeze’ will be beaten by
‘The Law of the Minimum’
The magnitude of the cost problem fac-
ing the man on the land is illustrated by
the fact that, although rural production
rose by 25% during the 1950’5, net in-
come actually fell by 20% over the
same period. These are official figures
for the Commonwealth of Australia.
To simply say that this can be altered
by increasing yield per acre is to under-
state the dramatic possibilities now being
disclosed by some emerging and startling
facts about plant growth—facts which
will trigger a revolution in agriculture
expansion.
Instead, we now know that if care is
taken to obtain the maximum use of the
resources—soil and water—yield will be
greatly increased and costs substantially
reduced.
The key to the situation is in a simple
but little-appreciated fact of plant
nutrition.
This fact is called ‘The Law of the
Minimum’ and states —‘The growth of
plants is limited by the most deficient
plant nutrient element present, all others
being present in adequate amounts.’
This means that an apparent abundance
of water and soil nutrient elements is
wasted if one of the elements is in short
supply. The plant will only progress to
the maximum ‘ceiling’ set by the most
deficient element, and it is a fact that
most Australian soils are deficient in
one or more of the vital elements of
nutrition.
If we can identify, in each particular
case, the elements which are limiting
plant performance and supplement them
readily, the plant (be it crop or pasture)
will use the full contribution to growth
made by all other elements present.
1
FERTILIZERS:
KEY TO FARM
PROSPERITY
It is immediately obvious that the extra
‘bonus’ in yields will be more valuable
to the man-on-the-land than increased
acreage—fixed costs will not be increas-
ed. He will tap the surplus capacity of
his land at present being wasted.
The process of supplementing the limit-
ing elements of plant nutrition is best
undertaken by the application of chemi-
cal fertilizers containing the elements
vital to plant growth. The most import-
ant of these are nitrogen, phosphorus,
potassium and sulphur, because these
are required in large amounts. Second-
ary and trace elements, notably cal-
cium, magnesium, molybdenum, zinc,
boron, are also necessary.
Today, Greenleaf is manufacturing fer-
tilizers containing these elements in the
varying proportions required for the
balanced nutrition of our crops and pas-
tures.

It's only 50 years ago that Electrolytic
Zinc Company produced the first high
grade zinc in Australia now each
year Australia uses more zinc per head
of population than any other country
in the world. Around twice as much in
fact. In that time E.Z.’s experience,
its attention to product quality and
service, and its development of valuable
overseas markets have made it a great
earner for Australia and Australians.
E.Z. plans to keep it that way.

PRESERVING THE PEACE
OF MIND OF
OVERSEAS INVESTORS
MINING • SECURITY ANALYSIS • BEHIND THE BALANCE SHEETS • THE MARKETS • OIL TABLE
IT MIGHT NOT have been a particu-
larly exciting Budget, but for investors
it was an extremely sound one.
One key consideration for Mr.
McMahon was the $4OO million port-
folio-institutional loan item of capital
inflow last year. Neither he nor any-
one else may have been particularly
clear just how much of that came
under the volatile portfolio classifica-
tion. But his brave, confident words
that such inflow would be main-
tained at an equally healthy rate this
year demanded a Budget that would
in no way disturb the peace of mind
of overseas investors.
Any sign of inflationary weakness
in the Australian economy could have
precipitated a nervous withdrawal of
overseas funds. And if Mr. McMahon
chose to dish out a little deflationary
discipline it was all for the good. Aus-
tralian industry may be grumpy about
the measures taken, but London has
allowed the 1968 Australian Budget to
pass into history with hardly a murmur.
The shine of the Australian dollar has
been preserved.
The Australian stockmarket, thank-
fully, did not take the small increase
in company and sales tax more
seriously than it deserved. Industrials
mostly firmed, nickels and gold im-
proved, and London, of course, led
the way. There is still time for second
thoughts.
The market’s first thoughts that
the rise in company tax can probably
be absorbed reasonably comfortably by
most companies may, of course, be
reversed should the Arbitration Com-
mission present another bill to industry
as a result of the total wage case com-
mencing this week.
It is not the Commission’s custom
to take much notice of warnings put
out in Federal Budgets on the dangers
of aggravating demand and cost pres-
sures. .i .
Here it must be remembered that
although the various industrials indexes
are pretty well at their all-time peaks,
they are heavily weighted with mineral
influences (as in the case of BHP and
CSR), and outside the range of first-
class industrial shares there are legions
of second- and third-raters, many of
whose prices have singularly failed to
reflect the buoyancy in the economy
which prompted Mr. McMahon to take
his precautionary action to prevent a
boilover.
In any review of the possibilities for
these less popular market fry it should
be borne in mind that it is the more
marginally profitable company that will
feel the impact of the rise in company
tax hardest, whereas the giants will
hardly notice it.
Whatever deflationary impact the
Budget may have will not come until
the second half of the financial year
when the company tax imposts begin to
bite —unless, that is, the risk of a
psychological impact is not yet past.
Though the scaling down or postpone-
ment of some expansion programs may
already be under consideration.
If no particular branch of industry
will suffer much from the increased
taxes, benefits from the extra spend-
ing powers injected into the economy
will be equally marginal. From the
$57 million provided in higher pen-
sions, the retailers should be able to
maintain their recent rises in sales;
the breweries, confectioners, food
trades, and cigarette companies
may gain a little. The overall in-
creases in grants and subsidies for
the rural industries should provide
better business for those who deal in
that area, particularly so in a year of
drought recovery.
All in all, the Budget demands of
industry a little more self-discipline,
a little more efficiency not much
to ask for a continuation of sound
economic growth.
NICKEL
JOIN THE RUSH
FEELING IS STRONG in the mar-
ket and among the better-informed
members of the mining fraternity
that Conzinc Riotinto of Aust. Ltd.
will announce at the end of this
month that their nickel prospecting
operation in Western Australia (they
are junior partners in a 60-40 arrange-
ment with America’s Anaconda) is
ready to change from prospecting to
mining. With this change will come a
change in the status of CRA’s nickel
interests, from speculation to invest-
ment. And since this is the first time
such a transition has taken place in
the nickel market, it will be interest-
ing to watch.
CRA’s chairman, Sir Maurice
Mawby, has said that the company
expected to be able to announce the
extent of the Widgiemooltha-Higgins-
ville nickel by the end of the year,
but added that it was hoped this might
be done for the half-yearly report this
month. Anaconda have made optimis-
THE CHARTIST SAYS: BOOTH INDUSTRIES LIMITED have a chart
which, since 1961, suggests that this stock has been undergoing a recessive phase
but is now showing technical signs of a promising recovery situation. A top
formation developed during the area of trading in 1962-63 and several selling
signals would have been indicated purely on a break of trend. A false breakout
occurred toward the end of 1965, but prices soon receded to lower levels and
the rate of decline accelerated to a final low of 24 cents in January, 1968. A
type of head and shoulders base formation now indicates that prices could rise
in the short term to about 60 cents, which would be a major resistance level.
The overall base suggests a minimum probable move for the longer term to
another important resistance level of about 95 cents, where the situation would
again call for reassessment. Last sale price on 15/8/68 —37 c.


tic noises also. This, with the length
of the area of contact and the realisa-
tion that Anaconda-CRA have been
in the area longer than Western Min-
ing on nickel seeking, all adds up to
a bullish atmosphere.
The focus has been on Anaconda-
CRA and on Great Boulder-North
Kalgurli, whose Scotia intersections
have now given rise to a minable
proposition; Great Boulder last week
discussed railway plans with Western
Australia’s Minister for Railways, Mr.
Ray O’Connor, and are busily plan-
ning a township and a road beyond
Scotia to Carr-Boyd Rocks, to the east,
where they have another bundle of
nickel tenements.
Meanwhile, two significant develop-
ments have been taking place quietly.
The first is an extension of “the nickel
belt.” Intersections around Higgins-
ville and Scotia are 115 miles apart.
But far beyond these limits promising
signs of nickel are being discovered
and experienced mining companies are
exploring actively. Marble Bar, 720
miles from Kambalda, is being
thoroughly raked over, as is Esperance
to the far south-south-west, and such
areas as the Murchison goldfields on
the boundary of the Pilbara.
The other change is a continuing
process the arrival of new mining
giants, so many now that the fanfare
trumpets have been put away. The
latest of them is Kennecott Copper
Corporation, whose Australian sub-
sidiary has started pegging north-east
from Kalgoorlie near the ghoulishly
named Carnage Lakes. Union Miniere,
Cominco, Grace Ore, and Mining
Cox and Amax are among the latest
on the growing list that started in
the pre-Kambalda days with giants
like Newmont, Anaconda, Pickands
Mather, and Anglo-American.
Another newcomer is among the
handful of big exploration companies
combing the Kimberleys, an area about
the size of Tasmania, at Western Aus-
tralia’s far north as far from Perth
and Kambalda as Sydney is from
Cooktown. The Australian company’s
name is Serem (Aust.) Pty. Ltd., and
it is a subsidiary of Le Bureau de
Reserches Geologiques et Minieres, of
Paris.
REAL ESTATE
LANDALL COMES EAST
THOSE WHO WISH to share in the
Western Australian boom but who have
a preference for real estate rather than
mineral stocks should seek out Landall
Holdings shares when they join the Syd-
ney lists this week.
Currently quoted in Perth at $2.45,
the shares yield 4.9 percent on the
augmented dividend of 12 percent, and
1968 profit gives an earnings yield of
12.2 percent. Earlier this month 500,000
$1 shares were placed at $2.15 with
Australian and U.K. institutions, bring-
ing capital to $1,144,000. (Previous
growth was financed by par issues in
October, 1967, and December, 1966.)
The builder and estate developer has
concentrated to date on designing and
building homes and flats in Perth and
Kwinana. It expects to build over 800
dwelling units in the current year com-
pared with 571 in 1967-68. It has a
London office to assist migrants with
their housing.
Landall is currently building a new
factory costing around $200,000 to pro-
duce up to ten transportable homes a
week for use outside Perth. The rest
of the proceeds of the recent placement
will be employed in purchasing more
land for development.
Perth’s population is expected to
grow from 600,000 to one million by
1980, and Kwinana’s to 150,000, so
there is plenty of market growth for
Landall and its competitors, Realty
Development Corporation, Hooker Cor-
poration (since January in W.A.),
Plunketts, and General Agency. And if
Western Australia’s boom busts, Lan-
dall, with its new connections, could
always move east.
WOOD-CHIPS
SIGNIFICANT HARBOR
SHARES IN the Western Australian
timber-merchant company Bunning
Timber Holdings Ltd. have been pushed
up from $2.25 to a record high of $3.35
this year, largely on the strength of
hopes that the company will win a two-
way tussle and be granted rights to set
up a wood-chip industry in the south-
west.
The scheme is to provide partially
processed timber for the Japanese paper
industry, with the eventual aim of using
the same materials to feed a home-
grown paper industry. The first set of
proposals went in nearly a year ago,
with Bunnings and Hawker Siddeley
Building Supplies the last two in the
pre-selections from several groups. A
decision is expected any day; Bunnings
were told they would know the result
of the Government’s selection in mid-
August.
One of the reasons Bunnings are being
favored in the market book is that the
State Government has recently made a
politically bold decision in selecting
Western Australia Development Corp-
oration to submit plans for redeveloping
the northern end of Perth (The Bulletin,
August 12). Hawker Siddeley were
handed the State Building Supplies
organisation when the Liberal-Country
Party team was first elected. The British
group has out-performed the old State-
owned enterprise, but the Government
has not been forgiven for handing the
industry over on such lenient terms; to
hand Hawker Siddeley another profit-
able industry ahead of Bunnings, after
the selection of WADC, might be hand-
ing over too much political ammunition.
Even without the wood-chip industry,
Bunnings are moving ahead soundly.
They have moved into more efficient
premises, have set up a highly successful
home planning and home improvement
service, and, despite the already high
operation level from the boost given the
company by supply of sleepers for north-
west rail projects, the half year to
December 31 was one of a “substantial”
increase in profits. The Western Aus-
tralian building industry is being spur-
red into a remarkable advance. Last
year the number of houses built
increased 22 percent (compared with
14 percent the previous year), clay-
brick production was up 30 percent
(16 percent the previous year), roofing
tiles 16 percent (8 percent), sawn
timber 5 percent (compared with a
3 percent decline the previous year).
The State Government has under-
taken to increase the building of State
Housing Commission homes 50 percent
this year. Already the impact of this
is being felt in permits and approvals,
up an average of 46 percent on the
previous year’s figures; for May-June
of this year, permits and approvals
(currently being translated into bricks
and mortar) are up 36 percent on 1967
and 82 percent on 1966. Bunnings are
hitched firmly to this rise.
But a decision on the wood-chip
industry will have important effects on
other Western Australian stocks. It is
planned to rail the material to Bunbury
for export; where it will be railed from
was the issue of the second proposition
put up by the companies, but Bunbury
will be the shipping-out point. Here
the State Government in March out-
lined a plan to improve the harbor
with $6.2 million development initially
and a S2O million scheme eventually.
Bunbury’s harbor bottom is basaltic,
which cannot be deepened economic-
ally. Despite the stepped-up activity
in the south-west of the State, notably
with beach sands and associated in-
dustries, Bunbury’s overall growth rate
slowed down in the past few years,
from 4.8 percent between 1954-61 to
3.4 percent 1961-66. The harbor has
28ft. 6in. of water at three of its seven
berths, but these cater only for con-
ventional ships of 13,000 tons, not
nearly big enough to break into export
markets. Geraldton, with similar
problems, had the Geraldton Maru
and Margaret Maru built specifically
for the Western Mining-Hanna-Home-
stake iron export project, but even
these ships are only 26,000-tonners.
Coal export hopes of Western
Collieries Ltd. and the Griffin Coal
Mining Co. flounder in Bunbury’s
shallow harbor. Western Collieries’ coal
has been accepted for export to Japan
if “certain problems” can be overcome
—the chief of these Bunbury’s shallow-
ness and costs. Griffin have been trying
for many months to make a break-
through with exports to Japan.
Western Collieries in July announced
a joint feasibility study with Sumitomo.
Stalemate has been reached in the
past because it was felt that exports
should be established before expensive
changes could be made yet exports


could not be established until the
harbor capacity, calling for expensive
changes, was increased. The wood-chip
industry is likely to clear this bottle-
neck. The success of Griffin’s coal in
the Western Titanium ilmenite bene-
ficiation operation gives hope that it
may also be used for the technically
similar technique of metallising. So, one
way or another, there is a great deal
swinging on the Western Australian
Government’s decision on wood-chips.
POST-BUDGET
TWO PROSPECTS
NARROWING DOWN the post-
budget prospects of shares, two that
should attract more attention in the
market are fertiliser companies and
book publishers. The former should
benefit considerably from the continu-
ance of the fertiliser subsidies, especially
the superphosphate one, which has been
increased by $6 to $8 a ton and made
inclusive of compounds containing trace
elements. True, competition is rife in
this industrial field and threatens to
become even more intense, especially in
nitrogenous fertilisers, as a result of the
increasing supply from petroleum-based
plants. But at any rate the higher
subsidy on superphosphate makes
ICIANZ look an even more attractive
heavyweight investment than it did after
the latest results, which demonstrated
beyond all doubt that the huge invest-
ment expenditure of the group in recent
years is paying off in a big way.
Book publishing company shares are
few and far between on the Stock
Exchange lists, but one with possible
attractions (despite the folding-up of its
big contract to publish Life Inter-
national’s Australian edition) is Wilke
and Co., which in the past few years
has gathered three of the leading local
book publishers, Cheshires, Lands-
downe, and Jacaranda, under its roof.
The 50-cent shares have swung between
$1.25 and $1.98 this year and are now
around $1.50, at which the yield is 5
percent on the 15 percent dividend,
which last term’s earnings covered 2.6
times.
STEEL
DOMESTIC REVIVAL
SHAREHOLDERS OF William
Adams must have listened to their
chairman with rather mixed feelings at
last week’s annual meeting. No doubt
it is all part and parcel of the reli-
ability of this old company that Sir
John Hurley should pitch his remarks
in such a low and ultra-cautious key.
On the strength of a 5.2 percent sales
increase for the first three months of
the current year, all Sir John could
find to say was that “we will be able
to maintain the current rate of divi-
dend.”
And shareholders, too, had to swallow
a blunt statement dispelling any hopes
of a speedy share issue. The company’s
sights at present are set on adding
long-term funds and seem to fit into a
pattern of utilising bank overdraft and
loan moneys.
Still, after last year’s good recovery
(especially obvious over the second
half) directors are budgeting for
higher sales in all divisions. Some slight
worry is expressed about industry’s
slow rate of investment in machine
tools and suchlike productive items.
Yet some of the obviously coming im-
provements in the rural sector should
seep through to the metal-working
industry and bring a fillip to investment
in 'new plant.
Perhaps the best news for Adams
came from an outside prediction at the
end of the week. BHP has been able
to report a “decided upswing” in orders
for steel and steel products. Sir lan
McLennan sounded quite positive about
a revival in domestic demand. Adams’
steel merchandising must benefit ac-
cordingly. The aluminium side looks
quite favorable as well.
All in all, shareholders may be in
for a somewhat sedate year. But new-
comers may find present price levels
around $2.20 and a yield of 5.7 per-
cent reasonably attractive. The shares
could fairly soon get a good deal closer
to the present year’s top of $2.35.
NATURAL GAS
ASSOC. BOUNCES BACK
AFTER THE KNOCK-BACK from
Pickands Mather, the Zinc Corporation,
and Kaiser Steel on the option over the
Bluff coal deposits, the Associated
Group earns fresh market appreciation
with its accelerated oil exploration in
Queensland. The aim is to improve
profitability on the Roma-Brisbane pipe-
line —which can cater for 2\ times the
volume of present contracts of only 20
million cubic feet a day—by finding
more fields.
A two-rig program of seventeen new
exploration wells by December was
tabled this week. The first is Wallum-
billa No. 4, south-east of Roma, now
in progress.
The Wallumbilla South prospect was
first drilled in 1967 when the No. 1
well recorded flows of 4.6 million cubic
feet of gas on Jin. chokes in May. The
No. 2 well was a major discovery of 8.1
million cubic feet of gas on Jin. bottom-
hole choke in July. This well was re-
ported to have the greatest. open gas
flow potential of any in the area to
date. The No. 3 well, one mile east of
No. 2, failed to encounter hydrocarbons
in August last.
Most Roma gas wells have been com-
pleted in Jurassic sandstones, but the
strong flows from the No. 2 well were
from the underlying Permian formation,
suggesting that a second major gas-
bearing zone exists in the area.
A second well is planned on the Glen-
tulloch structure to 3100 feet, and four
more targets may be drilled in the
environs while the rig is there.
The group is also taking another look
at Westgrove, where gas was produced
in 1963 at the rate of 1J million cubic
feet a day from an interval around
12,300 feet. Subject to additional seis-
mic confirmation of structure at depth,
Westgrove may be deepened to 15,000
feet.
Other wells being considered are six
low-cost shallow wells on the Roma
shelf and four to the east in sediments
of 7000 ft. thickness, a well near Moura,
and one near Brisbane on St. Helena
Island.
If Westgrove stands up to drilling,
the six months’ program may be three
times as costly as in recent half years.
Shareholders of Associated Freney,
Associated Continental, Associated Aus-
tralian Oilfields, Papuan Apinaipi, and
even Interstate might expect an
approach for funds. The group must
make the most of the current stock-
market interest in oil and minerals.
OIL POLICY
REMARKABLE PROFIT
THE GOVERNMENT’S “scandalous
and inept” policy on oil will be adding
more than $lOO million a year to costs
by 1970, according to economist Alex
Hunter at a meeting last week of the
Canberra economics society.
It was a meeting at which officials
in the Departments of Trade and
National Development who administer
the policy were conspicuous by their
absence, more evidence for the asser-
tion by Treasury and other economists,
that they have simply given up any
attempt at defence.
Dr. Hunter estimates that Esso-
BHP can produce oil from Bass Strait
at 80 cents a barrel and get a 15 per-
cent return on funds employed. Having
incurred the 37.5 cents State Govern-
ment royalty and 12.5 cents transport
charge, the company can sell oil at
the Westernport refinery for $1.30. But,
as a result of Government policy, laid
down in 1965 and not yet altered, the
company will, in fact, get paid $3.50,
providing a straight profit of $2.20 a
barrel. By 1970, when production will
be 240,000 barrels a day, this will mean
$2OO million a year.
Dr. Hunter doesn’t begrudge the
firm all of this. But he argues that
the import parity price of $2.40 is
the sensible figure. It would provide
a return of $lOO million in addition
to the normal profit of 15 percent
on funds employed, and it would
allow prices of petroleum products to
be maintained at their present level.
The second hundred million dollars
is a sheer giveaway, at the expense
of consumers and industry, he says.
The policy of forcing local refineries
to buy all Australian crude produc-
tion was also criticised. Extensive
modifications will be needed for most
refineries to switch over to the lighter

THERE'S SOMETHING
FOR YOU IN THE

Bass Strait crude, costing between
$lO million and $l5 million each.
There are other disadvantages. The
Australian crudes are so light it is
impossible to get any bitumen out of
them, and they will yield only six
percent of the heavy fuels which con-
stitute 25 percent of the Australian
market. Almost a half of current
heavy fuel production from Australian
refineries is exported or goes into
ships’ bunkers, earning foreign ex-
change. This would be lost in a
switch to Australian crude.
He presented figures showing that
the Government’s oil policy would,
if adhered to, increase the cost of
petroleum products by an absolute
minimum of 12 percent in 1970, with
further rises each time new oil deposits
were discovered. An increase of 12
percent means three or four cents a
gallon extra for petrol.
The alternative advocated by Dr.
Hunter is virtually a free-trade policy
under which producers and refiners
could do what was cheapest and most
profitable. He estimates that, anyway,
between 10 and 20 percent of Australian
crude would be used by Australian
refineries, which are designed to take a
blend of crudes from different fields.
The remainder could profitably be sold
in Japan, on the West Coast of the
U.S., and in South-East Asia, where
there is a strong demand for light
crudes. Dr Hunter reckons it would
fetch between $1.60 and $1.90 a barrel.
This way, the improvement in the
balance of trade on petroleum products
would be slightly less than with the
enforcement of local usage of all-
Australian crudes, as currently proposed
by the Government. But it would save
us the 12 percent increase in the cost
of petroleum products; and it would
save expensive modifications to Aus-
tralian refineries, the cost of which
would also be passed on.

NEW BROKEN HILL'S
COPPER WITH
A HINT OF NICKEL
AT CURRENT PRICES around
$lB.OO, New Broken Hill shares are
selling for around 13 times prospective
earnings in the mid-19705, according to
the London stockbroking firm of Myers
and Co. The bulk of these earnings will
be coming from the company’s 26 2-3rd
percent interest in Bougainville Copper
Pty. Ltd., which is confidently expected
to become a commercial operation pro-
ducing at least 80,000 tons of copper
per annum with 300,000 ounces of gold
per annum as a by-product, commencing
in 1972/73. New Broken Hill has a
one-third interest in the exploration
program of Conzinc Riotinto of Aus-
tralia Limited, which is the holder of
the Bougainville leases, but under the
agreement with the Administration of
the Territory of Papua and New Guinea
20 percent of the capital of Bougainville
Copper Pty. Ltd. has to be offered to
the Administration of the Territory,
which can then either retain this holding
or invite residents of the Territory to
purchase shares. Should this offer be
taken up in full, CRA’s share would
fall to 53 l-3rd percent and New
Broken Hill’s share to 26 2-3rd percent.
Following statements made by the
chairman of both the Rio Tinto-Zinc
Corporation Ltd. of the U.K. and
Conzinc Riotinto of Australia Ltd., the
confidence held in the project by Myers
and Co. is well founded. By last Decem-
ber, ore reserves had been established to
contain 230 million tons assaying 0.63
percent copper and 0.45 dwts. gold per
ton. There has been no increase in these
figures since then, but further explora-
tion on the island can be expected to lift
this tonnage considerably.
The profit figures estimated by Myers
and Co. are based on the profitability
of the huge Palabora copper project
in South Africa, which produces 80,000
tons of copper per annum from ore
assaying about 0.8 percent but, Myers
go on, the Bougainville project is likely
to be considerably larger, costing per-
haps $2OO million and producing
120,000 tons of copper per annum,
which would also contain 450,000 ounces
of gold. At this higher rate of produc-
tion Myers suggest that with an average
copper price of £stg.4oo, pre-tax profit
could be in the range of £stg.4.B million
to £stg.B.o million. For the first three
years of operations, the company would
pay no tax, but from the fourth year
taxes will become payable, increasing
from 25 percent to 50 percent over four
years. (Royalties payable to the Terri-
tory Administration are 1 £ percent of the
value of copper.) When the highest tax
rate begins to apply the project should
show a fall in earnings, but Myers sug-
gest that by that time (1975/6) other
new projects should be contributing sub-
stantial profits. However, the consider-
able amounts of capital expenditure
necessary in order to make the project
commercially feasible will no doubt be
written off over perhaps 20 years and
could well mean a sizable reduction
in the incidence of taxation, depending
on the extent to which capital expendi-
ture is allowed as a deduction from
taxable profits.
The other new projects to which
Myers refer are the Company’s interests
in the nickel exploration activities of
the CRA group in Western Australia
and the increasing trade investments
held by New Broken Hill in Sulphide
Corporation Ltd. and Greenleaf Fertil-
isers Pty. Ltd. Myers suggest that pros-
pects for the fertiliser interests, which
include an interest in the new Eastern
Nitrogen Ltd., are excellent. The West-
ern Australian nickel interests are those
at Widgiemooltha and Higginsville
where it has a 13 l*3rd percent interest
with CRA holding a 26 2-3rd percent
interest and Anaconda a 60 percent in-

terest. At Widgiemooltha, low-grade
mineralisation of an average one percent
nickel has been established over a length
of 350 feet with an average width of 35
feet in one location and at another
location high-grade sulphide ores were
intersected over a narrow width. At
Higginsville a little south of Widgie-
mooltha, diamond and percussion drill
holes and trenches have exposed ore
with a strike length of 1000 feet within
which three drill holes assayed four per-
cent to 11 percent nickel with some
copper, over widths of four to ten feet.
At another location near Higginsville,
Anaconda also announced the existence
of high-grade nickel sulphides, but no
details of this other find have yet been
given.
At present, however, CRA group
exploration has been concentrated at
Bougainville and in Western Australia,
and the existence of commercial quan-
tities of nickel ore on a scale likely to
interest the CRA-Anaconda group is by
no means a foregone conclusion.
On the other hand, by the time that
earnings from Bougainville become
liable for maximum tax rates, it is more
than likely that CRA’s exploration
activities will have turned up some in-
teresting deposits in other areas, even if
the nickel strikes in Western Australia,
turn out to be limited in size.

PLENTY OF HOPE
FOR
ADELAIDE CEMENT
STIFF COMPETITION is un-
doubtedly the rule among cement
makers, for the industry has to live
with a considerable over-capacity.
This, and the lethargy of the South.
Australian economy, has been notably
overcome by Adelaide Cement Hold-
ings Ltd., whose latest profit is markedly
better than its predecessors. And the
result has been achieved on tonnage
sales 0.7 percent lower than the pre-
vious year’s.
Certainly a price increase of 50
cents a ton in November, 1966
(effective for only half of 1966-67
but for all the latest year), must have
accounted for much of the improve-
ment. To explain the rise, the com-
pany stated that cement prices had
risen only seven percent since 1954,
compared with a 75 percent lift in
the average weekly earnings of its
male employees.
The problem of over-capacity is
endemic to most States and follows
heavy investment in new plant. A
and K Cement and Associated Port-
land provide clear examples. A and

gon, in Victoria, and at Kandos in
N.S.W., worked at about 56 percent
of capacity last year and had to lay
off men. Associated Portland, at
Waurn Ponds in Victoria and Maldon,
Portland and Charbon in N.S.W.,
used about 66 percent of its capacity.
Adelaide Cement, too, has excess
capacity. Its No. 6 cement grinding
mill, installed in 1967-68 at a cost of
$BOO,OOO, alone could handle the supply-
ing of the two cement kilns (the first
commissioned in 1953, the second in
May, 1966). The company has two other
cement grinding mills and no clue is
given as to how close it has worked to
kiln capacity of 460,000 tons.
Apart from some traditional incur-
sions of Geelong Cement into the south-
east corner of South Australia, Adelaide
Cement does not have much interstate
competition in its home State. The only
other producer there is Brighton Cement
Holdings, which markets its production
jointly with Adelaide Cement. The com-
pany has never considered extending
into the ready mixed concrete business,
as it supplies cement for nearly all this
market in South Australia anyway.
The substantially lower price of bulk
cement ex works, $17.10 in the Adelaide
metropolitan area in contrast to $2O in
Melbourne depots, $22 in Perth, $25.48
in Sydney, $lB in Brisbane, protects
South Australia from much interstate
invasion and allows Adelaide Cement
to make significant and growing sales
in adjacent areas of New South Wales
and Victoria. Adelaide Cement thinks
that this lower price has contributed
largely to the higher per capita usage of
cement in South Australia than in other
States.
The company transports its raw
materials some 50 miles limestone
from company quarries at Kleins Point
on York Peninsula, and gypsum from
company leases at Lake Fowler, 15
miles from Kleins Point to the Bir-
kenhead plant, whereas most Australian
cement plants are located at the site
of the raw materials. The price of power
and fuel (oil, next year to be replaced
by natural gas) is higher in South
Australia than most States. The com-
pany runs its own $1 million bulk lime-
stone carrier, which went into service
on May 1, 1966.
There has been some success in selling
partially processed material clinker to
Ceylon in 1967-68 and to Suva in the
current year. Clinker is the product of
approximately three-quarters of the
cement-making process (limestone and
rocks finely ground and heated in the
kilns make clinker). Certain countries
with no local limestone find it cheaper
to buy clinker, the price of which is
relatively low on world markets, saving
the major part of capital expenditure
for cement manufacture.
Adelaide Cement spent $300,000 on
new plant in 1968, making a total $5.3
million since 1964, all funded inter-
nally except for $490,000 from a one-for-


five par issue in September, 1965. Apart
from normal cash flow of retained
profits and depreciation, much of these
funds came from liquidating invest-
ments, a practice to which most con-
servative companies resort most
unwillingly. In 1964 investments totalled
$1.7 million; by 1967 these had been
run down to $375,000. The latest
accounts show some building up of the
portfolio to $547,000; this is where the
company will place spare funds in
future.
Shareholders have done very well in-
deed since the renaissance of the com-
pany in 1947, when a complete recon-
struction of the works began. Formation
of the holding company, in January,
1960, gave shareholders a virtual two-
for-one bonus. Since then they have had
two bonuses in the ratio of one-for-three,
in April, 1963, and February, 1967.
Dividend in 1967 was a six percent
interim before the bonus of a five-and-
a-half percent final on bonus-enlarged
capital. In the year under review the
company had no trouble in lifting divi-
dend to 12 percent.
Declared profit for 1968 of $812,836
was after $58,176 loss on sale of fixed
assets, mostly from the sale of the ship
Maltara, for which there was very little
demand. The operating profit of ap-
proximately $871,000 is after providing
$416,000 tax at old rates of percent
in the $. No adjustment may need be
made for the higher rate brought down
in the Federal Budget, as this provision
could be generous enough. It is after
some investment allowance, though
nothing like as significant as in prior
years, and seemingly includes some pro-
vision for reassessment of previous years’
profits. The company’s liability for de-
ferred tax of $139,980 was mostly from
previous excess provisions, and some
from current provision.
The Bulletin profit figures below are
adjusted for later underprovisions and
overprovisions inasmuch as they have
been specifically ascribed to the previous
year. The 1967 profit is therefore cor-
rected to $696,000 after $457,000 tax,
and after exceptional expenditure of
$135,000 for overhauling number three
kiln, which had been in continuous
operation save for three to six days
stoppages to renew refractory brick lin-
ing, since installation in 1953. Revised
earning rate for 1967 is thus 17.7 per-
cent on final post-bonus capital.
None of the company’s plant is
more than 20 years old. And even
plant purchased in 1948 is still modern
by today’s standards, with perhaps
only Perth’s Cockburn Cement having
newer facilities.
Building is still depressed in South
Australia, yet the company sees some
signs of an upsurge toward the end
of this year. With no major expendi-
ture to be made this year and no run-
ning-in of new plant, the company is
set for an even better year than last.
Although at $2.25 the shares are
only a cent lower than this year’s
peak, and at least 50 percent above
the 1967 low after the watering
of capital, they are not necessarily
overpriced. They should certainly be
held by present shareholders. This
company should survive the period of
over-capacity in the industry better
than the giants in the major States.

WATTYL PAINTING
A PATH TO
GOOD CAPITAL GAINS
WATTYL is a medium-sized Aus-
tralian-owned company which is truly a
David among Goliaths in the paint and
protective-coating field but which in
terms of profit return to assets em-
ployed leaves its competitors for dead.
Wattyl’s rate of pre-tax profits to total
assets (22.5 percent in 1967) is about
double the average rate of return earned
by the top 500 companies in Australia.
Wattyl does not depend on overseas
know-how for its technical formula-
tions but relies entirely on its own re-
search and development, and, in an
industry where chemical background
experience is vital, tranis its chemists
to be not only researchers but also more
effective salesmen and administrators.
With 60 percent of its total employ-
ment of 180 with tertiary qualifications
in chemistry, Wattyl is destined for a
very bright future. Capital gains in the
market place should be commensurate.
At first sight, the paint and protective-
coating industry does not seem a very
inviting background from which to
expect a rich harvest in profits or to
become excited by any outstanding
growth potential. The annual rate of
growth of paint over the past decade
has averaged only 4 percent. The paint
industry in Australia tends to be domin-
ated by four companies, which produce
about 75 percent of the industry out-
put, whilst another 200 paint companies
share only the balancing 25 percent.
The big boys are Balm (70 percent
owned by IGIANZ), Taubmans (55
percent owned by Courtaulds, U.K.),
Lewis Berger (wholly owned from the
U.K.), and British Paints, which is now
owned by Celanese Corporation, U.S.
These four companies are particularly
strong in the fastest-growing sector of
the paint market, namely industrial
primers and undercoats and finishing
coats, which account for about one-
third of total paint sales and contribute
perhaps 50 percent of total industry
profits. Despite the already high level
of concentration in the industry, it is-
quite on the cards that plans for a
new big paint company in Britain, which
might embrace Taubmans’ parent com-
pany, along with International Paints,,
and even include Bergers, could, if it
comes off, spill over to Australia, forc-
ing new mergers here. Most people tend
to be over-impressed with bigness, but
there is always room for the smaller
company which is more enthusiastic,
more keen to succeed, and has plenty
of marketing vitality.
Wattyl is Australia’s largest producer
of specialist wood-finishing products:
for the furniture and woodwork trade,
the home handyman, and the do-it-
yourself and hobby enthusiast. The
company is also a substantial producer
of industrial pigmented surface coatings
and its “R 109” house paints are mak-
ing a good run in an admittedly over-
crowded field. On a composition of the
company’s business, wood-finishing-
products for the furniture and wood-
work trade and industrial pigmented
surface coatings are about equal in size
and combined contribute over 50 per-
cent of the group’s sales volume; next
in importance comes the hobby and
do-it-yourself market, followed by house-
paints and timber-flooring products.
The company had its origins in 1915
when H. R. Walters commenced to-
make “Crystal Veneer,” a household
furniture polish, in a small factory in
Sydney. During the 19305, the com-
pany extended its operations into fur-
niture-finishing products and in 1952
came “Estapol,” a polyurethane plastic
which first came into public prominence
as a surface coating on timber floor-
ing. H. R. Walters died at the age of
82 in 1956. At the time of the public
float in 1959, his son M. B. Walters
(now 64), a chemical engineer by train-
ing, became non-executive chairman,,
and A. J. Berry (now 52), a chemist,,
became managing director. The Walters:
family still take an active interest in
the company, holding about 10 percent
of the stock. The average age of the
senior executives below the level of the-
managing director is about 40.
Today, the company operates two-
factories in Sydney (at Lidcombe and
Fivedock) and three factories in Mel-
bourne, but the Melbourne operations
are to be consolidated on a four-acre
site at Moorabbin in a new factory
to be occupied in February, 1969. The
total factory space of the Wattyl group
when the new Melbourne unit is in
commission will approximate 270,000
square feet. In addition to sales offices:
in Sydney and Melbourne, the company
has a branch office in Adelaide and
sells in other centres through agents.

This is one section of Sydney's skyline which owes much to the use of
coppermetals in unusual and interesting applications. The buildings
concerned are the State Government Block and Qantas’ new Wentworth Hotel.
Over 900 tons of copper and copper alloys were involved in the State Office
Block, including 200 tons of pre-oxidised brass used in the cladding of its
exterior columns. About 250 tons of bronze sections were used in the window
frames and electrically-operated sliding doors. Another interesting feature
seen in the left foreground is a 56 ft. diameter copper-clad fountain. This
also doubles as a cooling medium for the massive air-conditioning system.
The Wentworth Hotel's two storey copper awning is unique in the world. It
has a surface area of nearly 4,000 square feet of smooth copper, with vertical
ridges and recesses 8 inches wide for its full width of 130 feet. This is matched
with a copper parapet around the front top of the building and there is also a
copper fascia above the Bligh Street entrance to the rear.
Both these fine buildings are splendid examples of the potential for copper-
metals wherever beauty and originality of design must combine with perma-
nence and practical utility.

for the furniture and woodworking
trades is very wide, including stains,
wood fillers, and putties to treat the
undersurfaces, and an equally wide
range of top-coat finishes, including
nitrocellutose lacquers, clear polyesters,
and modified urea formaldehyde
finishes. I was told that furniture
styles are changing dramatically, which
is increasing the volume of lacquers
and finishes used. The main trend is
away frqiji glossy finishes to satin
finishes, from dead-flat to off-gloss.
For the home handyman, the com-
pany has a comprehensive range of
products in well-stocked bars at hard-
ware stores. With the slogan “Wattyl
makes wood finishing easy” the com-
pany encourages the enthusiast to
experiment and provides a complete
technical service along with point-of-
sale material and extensive advertising.
For example, “Estapol” liquid plastic
enamel, available in 16 colors, can be
used on furniture, kitchen cupboards,
and built-ins to create an antique look,
a period enamelled look, or a modern
enamel look. “Forestwood” fence and
timber finish is for the “natural” finish-
ing of exterior timber; it both decor-
ates and protects the timber while
allowing it to retain a natural flat
“non-painted” appearance.
With the acquisition of Kaylo
Paints, Melbourne in 1968, Wattyl con-
siderably expanded its production
volume of industrial pigmented surface
coatings and here the range includes
various formulations of synthetic
enamels such as thermosetting acrylics
and melamine alkyds with specialised
finishes such as those with a wrinkle
look, a hammer finish, and in satin
finishes. In 1962, Wattyl acquired Taf-
felshone and Possum Paints, producers
of “R 109” house paints and “Possum”
paving paints. The company does not
sell house paints through retail out-
lets but sells only to painting and
building contractors and concentrates
on offering high quality with an
extremely fast and efficient service.

and this was followed up by a bonus

five in June.
Summary: At $2.12 the shares com-
mand a dividend yield of 3.8 percent
and the price-earnings ratio is 9.1. A
price-earnings ratio of 9 for this com-
pany gives plenty of scope for future
share-market gains.

THE ARTS
AND ENTERTAINMENT
Designing for the theatre
EXPERIMENTS
IN AUSTRALIA
By SANDRA HALL
ALTSTRALIAN designer Kenneth
Rowell has spent most of the past 18
years working in London, but, para-
doxically, his designs of the past year,
here in Australia, have been his most
experimental.
“By a series of happy coincidences,
I’ve had some of my most interesting
work in Australia,” he said, fingering
a model of the starkly arresting set of
the Australian Ballet Company’s pro-
duction of “Threshhold,” in which
rows of metal chains are suspended
from the ceiling against the blackness
of the rest of the stage. “I’m interested
in mixed media in theatre design in
construction, as well as painted
designs—and my commissions here have
enlarged my vocabulary as a designer.”
He came back to Australia last year
to design Balanchine’s “Ballet
Imperial” for the Company and to do
his first Wagner opera, “Tannhauser,”
for the Adelaide Festival, a production
in which he wanted to break away from
the traditional stylised presentations of
Wagner the symbolic oratorio mode
of Bayreuth.
And when his work on “Tann-
hauser” ended, Sir Robert Helpmann
already was thinking about his new
ballet, “Sun Music.” It called for the
maximum in visual experimentation,
and “Threshhold” has followed suit by
offering Rowell the same chance for
freshness in the creation of a particular
mood.
Rowell thinks of himself primarily
as a painter, and in between “Tann-
hauser” and “Sun Music” he has been
to New York for an ill-fated exhibition
of his paintings. “It opened on the
day of Robert Kennedy’s assassination,
from which it never really recovered.
But I’m going back to New York after
I leave Australia, and perhaps I’ll work
there for a while instead of in London.”
Almost every costume in “Sun Music”
is adorned with painted designs, a pro-
cess which employed three people for
the best part of a month. After the cos-
tumes were completed, they were then
placed in a special oven to bake the
colors so they could be laundered safely.
But the acquisition of two 3ft. rubber
balls, which are used in the “Energy”
movement, caused most trouble.
“They had to be strong but light
I couldn’t get them made here and I
tried everywhere in England. I finally
got on to Dunlop in the north of Eng-
land, who’d made some for a para-
plegic clinic, so they made up some
more for us.”
Rowell’s success as a designer has de-
manded a good deal of drive and deter-
mination over the years, but a kind of
good-humored sensitivity goes with his
seriousness about his work. Since he
first went to England 18 years ago on a
British Council scholarship, he has been
back to Australia several times, so that
to him the state of theatre in Australia
has now become a continuing story, the
later episodes of which are more
optimistic.
“For a long time before I left, I didn’t
expect to be paid for anything I did in
the theatre here,” he says.
Now, a handful of Australian theatres
have resident designers, although Rowell
feels designers’ opportunities are still
limited in commercial theatre because
“too many productions are brought from
overseas in toto. And it’s a great mis-
take. There’s no Equity for designers
either here or in England, although
there’s a strong one in the U.S. I think
it would be a good idea if there were
something of that kind to protect de-
signers’ interests and ensure they’re reas-
onably paid. Another thing I’d like to
see is the establishment of a department
of stage design at one of the art schools,
perhaps the National Art School.”
Rowell is by now a confirmed expa-
triate—London has become too familiar
and too exciting to give up, and there
are opportunities in the American
musical theatre yet to be explored, but
he is managing to balance proficiently
the best of both worlds.
SHORTCOMINGS
IN SYDNEY
By REX CRAMPHORNE
AFTER FREQUENTING Sydney
theatre for some time, I have become
aware of what looks like a remarkable
lack of original designers. Every pro-
duction I have seen credits someone
with “design” or “decor,” and only one
or two have betrayed the slightest hint
of freshness or originality. For a while
I used to comment on this, until I
became aware that what I was seeing
was not so much the work of a designer
as an expression of the atmosphere of
the theatre concerned. This works in
two ways: first, the theatre executes the
designer’s work; second, an experienced
designer will not go to the trouble of
designing something that he knows a
theatre will not be able to execute.
Which of Sydney’s theatres, then, has
the means to execute a design which
calls for more than flats and stock
Kenneth Rowell . . . optimism
windows and doors? The Independent
has a one-man workshop which has dif-
ficulty in producing good new flats, let
alone anything more complicated.
Moreover, the Independent’s stage
imposes important limiting factors on a
setting, including a raked floor and the
on-stage remnants of a former pros-
cenium arch. In-the-round Ensemble
has no need of flats, and finds
impromptu labor to assemble such slight
variations to the periphery of the stage
area as may be required. Should a
design call for any extensive new struc-
ture at the Ensemble, it would be
impracticable.
The New Theatre, whose simple
“America Hurrah” set was one of the
most pleasing I’ve seen this year, has
no possibility of large-scale experiment
in a theatre that must boast the smallest
stage and auditorium in Sydney.
Only the Old Tote, among Sydney’s
straight theatres, has a workshop
capable of producing an original
setting. This is a recent innovation,
and such a successful one that the
Tote is now able to build sets for
other theatres. Moreover, the original
Old Tote is eventually to be replaced
by a great new theatre at the
moment the company seems to be
“between theatres.” However, even if
the Tote can make it, a large-scale
new setting involves a great deal of
money. And so we come to the core
of the problem despite pretentions
about the use of designers, no theatre
can really afford the kind of facilities
needed to execute a creative new
design: “King Lear” will probably be
the only thing of this kind this year.
Commercial managements, such as
Williamsons or the Phillip, are not
involved in productions likely to re-
quire anything radically new in the
way of setting.
Ultimately, the only haven of com-
parative freedom for the designer is
the Trust, whose workshop is the only
thing of its kind in Sydney (i.e. big),
and whose financial situation, in re-
gard to opera and ballet, seems to
warrant a certain amount of originality
on the part of its designers. Though
even here the very size of the financial


undertaking imposes a degree of
“middle-of-the-road” commercialism
on the standard required.
So reluctantly one is forced to
treat design in Sydney theatre with
a measure of tolerance realising
that the dullness of what one sees on
the stages is only one symptom of
a widespread problem.
THEATRE/DUNCAN GRAHAM
FILLING IN THE GAPS
Die Brucke Company. Playhouse
Theatre, Perth.
THE CHARM OF the Goethe Insti-
tute’s Die Brucke (The Bridge) com-
pany, now visiting Australia for the
second time in two years, is that the
audience has only to be theatre-loving—
and not necessarily German-speaking—
to enjoy the performances.
The 12-member touring company has
two plays, Gotthold Ephraim Lessing’s
five-act comedy “Minna von Barnhelm”
and Franz Kafka’s drama “Das Schloss.”
The plays are staged on separate nights,
and the all-capitals Australian season
opened at Perth’s Playhouse Theatre
on August 9.
“Minna” tells of a Prussian Army
officer, Major von Tellheim (Chrstian
Rode), who is involved in a law suit
with the military when the Seven Year
War ends in 1783. While employed as
a tax collector, the major gave his for-
tune to save a town being plundered,
but his motives are misconstrued. Bereft
of both money and honor, he believes
he is no longer worthy of his fiancee,
the rich and lovely Minna (Antje Weis-
gerber). The problems are resolved and
the play develops its richness when the
ultra-feminine Minna, who has fought
for her love, shows her fiance that his
noble attitudes had other undercurrents.
Miss Weisgerber, one of Germany’s
best-known actresses, handled her part
as the contriving female with delicacy,
while Mr. Rode exactly epitomised the
fictional military hero with impeccable
motives. The acting was precisely pro-
fessional, faultlessly crisp. Acted against
a backdrop of the dark inside of an inn,
the talented cast gave an interesting
story color, movement, and a life of its
own.
Even the few Australians in the audi-
ence laughed spontaneously and seemed
untroubled by the language barrier. But
in retrospect this was not surprising, for
the inflections, gestures, and movements
filled in most gaps.
Kafka is another matter. Those who
are not students of his writing or who
have not attempted to unravel “The
Castle” are likely to find themselves
adrift in the same sea of frustration
as the play’s central character, “K.”
This is not meant as a reflection on the
acting, which is as faultlessly profes-
sional as “Minna,” with the cast
demonstrating the virtuosity and
fluidity of their talent in two totally
different plays.
“K” (Peter Liech) was played in a
convincing and powerful manner and
was strongly supported by the other
cast members, doubling in some roles.
Acted against black, grey, and white
screens, multiple lighting effects, and
electronic music, the effect created was
of an abstract, vacant atmosphere on
which the symbolic philosophy of Kafka
was etched for the individual playgoer’s
own interpretation.
Die Brucke played to medium-full
houses in Perth. They deserve full
houses elsewhere.
THEATRE/PHILLIP ADAMS
SPLIT-LEVEL HUMOR
Happy Days. Samuel Beckett. Arts
Theatre, Melbourne.
Say Who You Are. Waterhouse and
Hall. St. Martin’s Theatre, Mel-
bourne.
“HAPPY DAYS” is full of the same
capricious Irish humor that prompted
Bishop Muldoon to say: “I think
Catholics will heave a great sigh of
relief” when he spoke at the Pill Press
conference. For Beckett presents us
with a woman who, despite being buried
up to her neck in hot sand, remains
as pert as Pollyanna. A lesser heroine
might have moped in this symbolic
desolation, but Beckett’s Winnie is
appreciative of any small or even
microscopic mercy and is forever beam-
ing gratefully into the glaring and
unconcerned heavens.
But she is not entirely alone.
Although he is hidden from sight for
most of the play, she has her Willie.
One of Beckett’s most sparkling conver-
sationalists, he emits a total of 50
words at widely spaced intervals
throughout the evening. Like those
other irrepressible pessimists, Vladimir,
Estragon, Hamm, Clove, and Krapp,
Winnie is utterly isolated from life. To
keep the terror at bay she clings to
little rituals, chants cliches, and talks
non-stop. Only the sound of her own
voice prevents the terrifying silence
from destroying her.
The remarkable thing about this
play, like most of Beckett’s, is that its
atrophied humor works. The words may
fall like clods upon our coffin, but they
remain irresistibly funny, even if one
theoretically detests the author’s
cankered philosophy.
This is just the second production
at the new Arts Theatre, and it proves
again that the master of anti-theatre
can be relied upon to attract an anti-
audience. A few years back the cast
out-numbered the patrons at a presen-
tation of “End Game” I attended in the
Melbourne Town Hall which was
no mean feat, as that play has just four
characters. And on the second night of
the Arts Theatre season only half a
dozen seats were filled. Yet it’s worth
a visit to see Leila Blake and Stanley
Page at the end of Beckett’s tether.
They are both very good indeed.
It has been a time of ups and downs
for St. Martin’s. While controversy
sputters (it refuses to rage) about Sir
Henry Bolte’s rejection of the theatre’s
subsidy plea, J. C. Williamsons have
agreed to take their production of “Oh
What a Lovely War” to Sydney. Mean-
while, Irene Mitchell is presenting one
of St. Martin’s more familiar enter-
tainments in the form of a formula
bedroom comedy.
Fortunately, “Say Who You Are” is
a lot more inventive than most, hav-
ing been written by the authors of
“Billy Liar” and many of David
Frost’s better sketches. A seething hot-
bed of extremely complex pre-marital
and extra-marital couplings, it’s cleverly
played by Byron Williams and Marie
Redshaw with immoral support from
Nancy Cato and Joseph James.
It is not the sort of play I would
subsidise, as it’s the sort of play a
theatre without a subsidy is forced to
play. But if you would like to give
your refined sensibility an evening off
I’d heartily recommend it.
THEATRE/REX CRAMPHORNE
TRANSFORMATION
Private Lives. Noel Coward. Palace
Theatre, Sydney.
I CAN ONLY assume that the
sustained presence of Rosemary Martin
is what transforms this production; she
brightened the previous one with inter-
mittent appearances, but in “Private
Lives” she is on stage most of the time.
Her performance animates Amanda,
as a person, with such total success
that she automatically generates the
period (and style) in which the charac-
ter was created, as well.
“Private Lives” is a very good play—
richly varied in tone from outright
farce and verbal wit to accurately
observed nuances of emotion and char-
acter, which are extremely involving.
And Rosemary Martin can do it all at
once: the reunion scene in Act 1 is like
a high-wire act she takes the scene
along a thread of pathos with an ease
that would be remarkable in a straight
play, let alone 60ft. up in a comedy.
Of the other three actors in the
play’s quartet, only John Unicomb
(Victor) seemed a little insecurely
perched on caricature. Helen Morse
(Sybil) and Stuart Wagstaff (Elyot)
both seemed efficient and unobtrusive
• or perhaps I just had difficulty in
looking away from Rosemary Martin.
Two front-of-house aspects of this
season deserve passing notice: the first-
night audiences seemed to be the subject
of casting as careful as that of the plays
the cross-section of theatre and
Double Bay producing a hot-house, in-
group atmosphere which made it diffi-
cult to gauge normal reaction to the
play. More important, it is said to be
the last live season in the Palace. The
demolition of the only beautiful theatre
left in Sydney ought surely to be
opposed.

FILMS/BEVERLEY TIVEY
TWICE REDEEMED
Albert Finney and Liza Minnelli
between scenes of “Charlie Bubbles”
Charlie Bubbles. Director, Albert
Finney.
Reflections In A Golden Eye. Director,
John Huston.
AFTER HIS explosive screen appear-
ance in “Saturday Night and Sunday
Morning,” Albert Finney seetned, from
the filmgoer’s viewpoint, to go into a
decline. We read a lot about his stage
successes in London and on Broadway,
but although he visited Australia full of
plans about “Ned Kelly” (again?) we
only saw him in a bit part in “The
Victors” (one hopes, well paid) or in
movies like the catastrophic “Night
Must Fall” or “Two For The Road,” in
which he fought a losing battle against
astounding miscasting.
Now he redeems himself twice over
with “Charlie Bubbles,” an unusual and
memorable film in which he is both
director and star. His performance in
the title role —a perfect piece of casting
this time—is effectively understated;
and, despite a couple of lapses in its
early stages and a fantasy ending which
is imaginative but doesn’t really come
off, this is a striking debut for a
director.
Charlie, whose life and nature aren’t
nearly as effervescent as his name, is a
lowly born North of Englander who has
won fame as an author, losing in the
process his family, his old friends, and
his capacity for enjoyment. We meet
him first at a deadly business lunch in a
smart London restaurant, where he spots
an old drinking companion and tries to
recapture the careless fun of former
days. (This sequence, which degenerates
into foolish and improbable slapstick, is
the really jarring bit of the movie.)
Charlie then sets out to revisit his old
home town, where former acquaintances
greet him with a mixture of gush and
envy. He has a brief and joyless sexual
encounter with his hero-worshipping
secretary, and an unsatisfactory meet-
ing with his divorced wife and their
son, and in the final shots cuts himself
adrift from his life. Although it’s easy
to understand Charlie’s wish to cut
loose and throw out all the ballast he’s
collected, and though the sequence,, like
the whole film, is delightfully photo-
graphed, the sudden switch from realism
to fantasy is too awkward to be com-
pletely acceptable.
Still, this is a remarkable and curi-
ously haunting movie, beautifully cast
and acted, particularly by Billie White-
law as Charlie’s ex-wife, who makes
the best of things but is not in the
least resigned, and by Liza Minnelli as
Charlie’s American secretary. Roman-
tically in lovg with all things English
(she resolutely breakfasts on kippers and
toast and marmalade), she is funda-
mentally tough and determined to get
just what she wants from the Old Dart
and then go home. The actresses, and
Finney, both as star and director, are
greatly helped by a sharply perceptive
script by Shelagh Delaney.
The best advice to be given about
“Reflections in a Golden Eye” is to
read Carson McCuller’s novella, which
is a beautiful piece of writing, and stay
away from the movie, which may well
turn out to be the worst of the year.
A lot of money, a famous director, and
a cast of big names don’t, unfortun-
ately, add up to a good film when the
whole conception is wrong.
John Huston (who really should give
up directing in favor of acting • he
was very good in “The Cardinal”) at
first had the color print of the film
treated so that everything looked
golden; a literal approach which is the
measure of his lack of understanding
of the story. The .result when first
shown caused such derision that the
picture was hastily put back into normal
color photography, which is now as
variable as Elizabeth Taylor’s Southern
accent.
The script, which has been evolved
from McCuller’s eerie, lyrical story,
now sounds as if Frances Parkinson
Keyes had tried to write like Tennessee
Williams. So, perhaps it’s unfair to
blame the actors for poor perform-
ances Marlon Brando’s is just awful,
and indeed the only one who comes out
of the disaster well is Brian Keith,
who has the advantage of playing a
character presented as it was written
in the original book.

THE APPEARANCE of the lesser

of the new recording of “La Clemenza

it is lesser Mozart. It is not a question
of a. juvenile work awaiting the mastery
of later years. “Tito” was actually the
last opera Mozart wrote, and some of
its music is eminently worthy of the
composer, who is so rightly revered.
When it first appeared (1791) it was
rated by many as superior to “Don
Giovanni” and “The Magic Flute.”
But this was before the static traditions
of Handel and Gluck were superseded
by the integration of music and drama,
which Mozart himself did so much ta
bring about.
In “Tito,” Mozart fails to become
involved with his characters, they never
come to life. Clemency may be an
admirable quality, but Metastasio’s
libretto carries it to extremes. Surely
no Roman emperor was ever as clement
as this, and obviously the absurdity
of it all was crystal clear to the man
who explored the depths of Don
Giovanni and the Almaviva menage.
“Tito” was written for the coronation
of Leopold II of Bohemia (in spite of
Erik Smith’s interesting theories to
the contrary) and this may have
prompted Mozart to take the easy way
out by falling back on the obsolete
form of opera seria, its static set pieces
and even its castrato hero.
There is a great deal in common
between the many concert arias which
Mozart wrote for inclusion in other
people’s operas at the request of various
singers and the music of “Tito.” As
music much of it is quite superb, but
dramatically there is very little rela-
tion between text and score. There
are a number of fine ensembles alter-
nating with set arias, but by and large
it is a matter of: now I sing, then you
sing, and afterwards we both sing
together. The genius of Mozart makes
a lot of the singing most enjoyable
and the performance Decca offers could
hardly be bettered.
The producers have wisely refused to
compromise on the 'matter of transposi-
tion to attain dramatic effect in a work
singularly devoid of drama. This results
in three contraltos-cum-mezzo-sopranos
playing key roles, two of them male!
Teresa Berganza (Sesto, originally sung
by a contralto) is at her usual best.
Her partners are less well known, but
almost as good. The title role is
scored for a typical Mozart tenorino
(the first Tito was also the first
Ottavio) and Werner Krenn not only
sings well, but adds a degree of dignity
to the music of the Emperor which
could easily have been missed.
The whole operation is guided by
Istvan Kertesz, who seems a little at a
loss when treating the interminable
recitatives, but comes to admirable life
as soon as the big numbers come
around. Fortunately, the opera abounds
in these, and any Mozart lover (as
opposed to any opera lover) would do
well to investigate this set. The record-
ing is uniformly good and the analytical
notes are most explicit—a great asset
in the case of such a neglected work.


ART/ELWYN LYNN
QUALITY ENTERPRISE
Survey ’6B. White Studio Gallery,
Adelaide.
THE WHITE studio gallery has
mounted a show of 28 artists under the
brave title of Survey ’6B. It is not
a survey of the ’sixties or of the latest;
not even the Victorian Cultural
Centre’s huge temporary exhibitions’
court, where the New Abstraction shows
from August 21, could cope with such
a survey, for the ’sixties are proving to
be one of the most fertile and varied
eras of Australian art. The White
Gallery has assembled works by artists
whose influence has been direct or per-
vasive or both, but the Molvig comes
from 1951, a tiny Dobell looks as Imme-
diate as it did in 1943, and the large
Hodgkinsons, superior to what he
showed this year, are from 1966.
Yet the cross-section is wide enough
for some formulations about the style of
the ’fifties and early ’sixties to be made:
there is more similarity between the
dappled softness in a Ray Crooke and
loose, floating areas in Daws, Hodgkin-
son, and Williams than one suspected,
and Arthur Boyd’s and Perceval’s lush,
turbulent, expressive paint is closer to
the early dark Olsen and to Rapotec’s
golden visions of Spain than to their
starker, realistic confreres, Tucker,
Dickerson, and Brack; and Brett
Whiteley’s White Sacred Baboon,
despite its slightly foetid air and
aluminium gate, has a light, dashing
charm that associates it with the
diaphanous, powdery Williams.
As John Baily, Director of the South
Australian Gallery (which has a 'misera-
able yearly purchase fund of $8000),
notes in his introduction to the presti-
gious catalogue, the commercial gal-
leries play an important role in showing
works “that are creating the climate of
art,” for the State galleries, compared
with Victoria’s, are in a truly deplorable
state. When artists of repute are
attached to various dealers it is most
difficult, as the Director of White
Studios, Andris Lidums, is discovering,
to stage any kind of survey, and it is the
neutral role of the public gallery that
makes them the natural conveners, had
they the cash and facilities.
Mr. Lidums has attempted a quality
survey that is generally successful with
some good and so’me splendid works
like Albert Tucker’s Intruder Attacked
by Parrots (48in. x 60in., $3500) which,
with its dun, angular head and body of
the explorer backed by melting mauve
and screaming reds and yellows, so
epitomises the hostility of the interior
that Tucker remains the most uningra-
tiating of Antipodeans. (He detests
this label, incidentally.) An early
interest in surrealism still informs his
work and it is this, too, that saves
Perceval’s Veronica and the Con-
spirators (48in. x 54in., $5000) from the
dangers of decorative accumulation, for
amid the lush, joyous, and vibrantly
vital surface of grass and flowers lurk
trolls, Ensor-like heads that, but for
their gay color, could have co’me from
Bosch’s Christ Mocked. In comparison,
Rapotec’s The Awesome Cathedral
(72in. x 54in., $800) has a gracious
verve bathed in fading sunlight rather
than in awe. Certainly Tucker, Perceval,
and Boyd are infusing their works with
more psychological significance than the
emotive abstractionists; indeed, the
symbolism of a string-bag gourd sus-
pended over a gloomy land in Daws’
Death of the Tribe 111 (48in. x 58in.,
$600) looks theatrical compared with
the comic unease in Perceval. If Daws
sets the stage and waits for action, Dick-
erson’s Figure in the Wilderness, with
the long sharp fold in the garment and
the horizon cutting across the eyes, mak-
ing it rigid with tension, reveals the
angst of waiting for the action.
The action in Fred Williams’ Lyster-
field Road (46in. x 52in., $2500), in
his oriental mode of wispy notations,
is subtly dispersed by using treetrunks
as minute focal points. Sibley’s Homage
to Paul Klee No. 1 (50in. x 50in.,
Dickerson’s “Figure in the Wilderness”
$600) is a similar, but not so complete,
record of formation and dissolution of
flowing forms; but Klee, a miniaturist,
hardly submits to such inflation as do
the Cubists, as evidenced in the
tremulous-edged, free-floating, autumnal-
hued shapes in Franz Kempf. Guy Grey-
Smith in his Deserted Landscape (36in.
x 48in., $260) employs a flat, encrusted
cubism to achieve what he is best at:
a temporary monumentality, enhanced
by solid forms with scratched surfaces.
There is much more that should
commend the show to Adelaidians; and
elsewhere the following should not go
unnoted: the gossamer grey stains of
Royston Harpur, who lets them grow
naturally from white expanses at
Gallery A, in Sydney, and at the survey
at Sydney’s Blaxland, where Bill Brown
dashes his paint around collages with
fine exuberance. Among the New Zea-
landers at Bonython’s, Sydney, Milan
Mrkusich’s Ambient Gold (68in. x 68in.,
$750) beautifully blends severe geom-
etry and a vast fog-like area, and Bill
Gregory, an Adelaidian, shows gay
ceramics and a glass structure on
artificial grass, to show that Duchamp,
who, by fateful coincidence, is now
showing in Adelaide, is far from irrele-
vant. Gregory has a fanciful, even fan-
tastic, imagination and Adelaide should
be alert to him as they must now be to
the efforts of the White Studio.
MUSIC/KENNETH ROBINS
SURPRISES AND BONUSES
THERE WAS little to associate Ben-
jamin Britten’s “The Turn of the
Screw” at the Science Theatre of the
University of New South Wales with a
university production. In fact, it was
in many ways the antithesis of what
we have become accustomed to expect
from our tertiary-education establish-
ments in this field, for on the musical
side it was a splendid example of
technical expertise and on the produc-
tion side it lacked imagination and
revealed a remarkable ineptness, par-
ticularly in lighting.
Musically it was a totally professional
effort, Roger Coveil bringing erudition
and devotion to the business of con-
ducting a group containing some of
the best freelance players in Sydney
and on stage a group of intelligent
and vocally superb adult singers with
the addition of two commendably
accurate and decorative children.
Among the singers Robert Gard was
probably the most impressive in the
roles of the Prologue and Quint. Be-
latedly revealed in a brutally hard-
edged spot, he put everybody firmly
into the picture with a splendidly sung
Prologue, which was a model of
exemplary diction and at variance with
the rest of the night’s vocal offerings,
much of which could have well been
in Sanskrit. As Quint he was responsible
on at least three occasions for evoking
chilling terror, although undoubtedly
much of the credit for this must go
to Benjamin Britten. It is one of the
facts of life that any singer who is
cast in a role originally created for
Peter Pears will, if he can sing the
notes adequately, finish up sounding like
him. Despite this hazard, Mr. Gard
retained a fair modicum of originality.
The central part of the Governess
is by far the most taxing, and visually
and vocally Marilyn Richardson’s per-
formance was a virtuoso piece. Strong
and vital, she was a- dominating figure
throughout, moving beautifully and
meaningfully and singing her music
with her customary elan. This very
sureness, however, was inclined to
cushion the impact of the escalating
shafts of fear and to obscure the gentle,
warm, and timid aspects of a person


becoming numbed by terrifying isola-
tion and mounting horror..
Vocally Pearl Berridge and Rose-
mary Gordon as Mrs. Grose and Miss
Jessel were first-class, and Pearl Berridge
handled her minor histrionics well; but
the two children remained over-
healthily extrovert throughout, suggest-
ing no undercurrent of depravity and
making one doubt the too, too solid
presence of Mr. Quint and Miss Jessel.
The excellence of the singing was
matched by the work from the pit, and
despite the complications of parts of
the score there were very few instances
of untidiness. Mr. Coveil held things
together very well indeed and gave
point to considerably more than the
main facets of what must be one of the
most resourceful scores of all time.
This is music for musicians; every part
is full of stimulating passages for the
players, which can be the only reason
for taking the cello, for example, up
into regions where it is indistinguish-
able from the fiddle; these sections,
incidentally, were handled immaculately
by Barbara Wooley. But there were
plenty of explosions of virtuosity all the
evening, with probably the most memor-
able being a spectacular scramble all
over the bass by lan Farr. If Mr. Covell
intends to mount more of these
chamber operas professionally, more
strength to his elbow.
Should Benjamin Britten decide to
reduce his thirteen-piece orchestra in
“The Turn of the Screw” to two pianos
and a set of bongos he is likely to
finish up with a travesty on a par
with Stravinsky’s reduction of his
“Soldier’s Tale” to a trio composed of
violin, clarinet, and piano, which con-
cluded the recital of the Bath Festival
Ensemble for the Musica Viva at the
Town Hall. Admittedly the work is
likely to have a greater sale and conse-
quently more performances in this
version. On this occasion the Suite
received an excellent reading, with
Thea King getting some remarkably
aggressive sounds from a clarinet, but
this could not dispel the feeling that
Stravinsky had made a blunder.
In the Mozart G Minor Piano
Quartet, which opened the program, we
were treated to the best ensemble in-
cluding a keyboard instrument, that has
been heard here for some time. Piano
with strings is always a tricky com-
bination, but here the keyboard was
thoroughly at home texturally and
stylistically. The players, Robert
Masters, violin, Walter Gerhardt, viola,
Charles Tunnell, cello, and Joel Ryce,
piano, totally subjected their technique
to the music, and even the virtuoso
elements in the piano part were never
made an occasion for display.
Brahms’ Clarinet Trio got off to a
splendid start with a ravishingly beauti-
ful sound from Charles Tunnell’s cello.
The three-part fantasias of Purcell
which followed are hardly concert
music, but they are great music never-
theless and an important rung in the
aesthetic ladder, which, when fully
explored, will undoubtedly place Purcell
up with the mighty.
Communicating
THE DEATH OF LIFE
FREELANCE photographers are likely
to be the only Australians who’ll mourn
the imminent death of the Australia-
New Zealand edition of “Life” maga-
zine. In the 17 months it has been
publishing here the magazine en-
couraged utopian dreams among
photographers as a publication which
would splash their pictures handsomely
and pay generously (the rate was
around $150-$200 a page). Yet it has
been the magazine’s pictorial representa-
tion of mostly routine features of Aus-
tralian life that have contributed to
its increasing dullness in the terms of
the sort of publication it was supposed
to be. Illustrated features about surfies
and Hunter Valley grape-growing were
just not strong enough substitutes for
the vicarious pleasures offered by most
American glossy magazines.
The fact that “Life-Australia” was
always run from America (despite the
stream of mail advertising that came
from Amsterdam) didn’t help its
understanding of the Australian market.
The last Audit Bureau of Circulation
figures in March gave it a circulation
of 24,000 in New Zealand and 144,000
in Australia —not enough to meet its
costs and more than it is likely to have
when it dies on September 2.
INSOMNIACS CORNER
IT IS now reasonably certain that the
ABC’s long-running public affairs series
“Four Comers” won’t reappear in its
present form after the end of the current
season. Some viewers believe the pro-
gram already has been laid to rest. Its
recent lengthy survey of Western
Australia was so studded with boredom
and so totally unreflective of a boom
in minerals or anything else that it
should be preserved as a prize example
of insomnia therapy. Not even the most
extreme political pressure (the sort that
is the private burden of “Four Comers”)
could possibly have frightened the ABC
into producing such a completely dull
and technically inept program.
WAYSIDE INNOVATIONS
SYDNEY’S Wayside Chapel theatre in
Kings Cross has tempted many theat-
rical experiments in the past couple of
years and, unfortunately, defeated a lot
of them. The small, open stage is wedged
into a comer of the cramped, two-level
auditorium and productions there have
often been overwhelmed by technical
problems. Actor-producer Peter
O’Shaughnessy is the latest to take on
the Wayside’s challenge. On August 29
he will use it to accommodate what he
is calling “9 O’Clock Theatre.”
O’Shaughnessy’s opening show will
contain two short two-handed plays —
Ionesco’s “Frenzy for Two,” and Mar-
guerite Duras’ “La Musica.” O’Shaugh-
nessy will be partnered in both plays by
Christine Bartlett, a young Sydney
actress whose style impresses him. As
co-producer, he has recruited Aame
Neeme whose ingenious work on Syd-
ney’s theatrical fringe suggests that he is
well qualified to cope with the Wayside
Theatre’s difficult shape and size.
The set for the Ionesco play will be
the work of painter Charles Blackman,
an innovation which O’Shaughnessy
hopes will lead to more painters being
attracted to work for the theatre.
Painters have nothing to lose by such
an idea: if a show fails they can frame
the sets and sell them.
WHERE WE'VE LIVED
THE first full history of Australian
architecture will be published at the end
of the month. Written by Professor
J. M. Freeland, author of “Melbourne
Churches” and “The Australian Pub,”
the book surveys personalities, problems
and changing tastes in Australian
building design since 1788. Freeland,
now professor of architecture at the
University of New South Wales, took
a number of the book’s 230 photographs
himself.
Cheshires will launch his book,,
appropriately, at “Como” in Toorak*.
the showplace of the Victorian National
Trust.
HATE RATING
WITH America’s political arena cur-
rently in a froth of image-making and
gimmickry, political journalism over
there is having to turn more and more
to psycho-analysis to explain it all.
Washington columnist Stewart Alsop-
must surely get the silly season prize
for a “Newsweek” piece explaining
Richard Nixon’s “high hateability
quotient.”
“Nixon is the most totally self-
controlled politician of the generation,”
he wrote, “yet one senses churning
emotions underneath. My theory is that
there are two Nixons beneath the sur-
face and they are often at war with
each other.”
“That curious combination of Nixon’s
genuinely held moral convictions and
his instinct for the jugular makes him
a formidable politician,” wrote Alsop.
“He can fight when the situation calls
for fighting and he can preach when
the situation calls for preaching, and he
does both with great earnestness and
conviction. But living with two Nixons
in one body is a strain which accounts
for his total inability to relax. There is
something pathetic about the man:
Richard Nixon in all his life has never
really had any fun.”
But then after reading a piece like
that, one feels a loss of the simple
pleasure in just hating Richard Nixon,
anyway. J

AN ANTHOLOGY
OF OLD IMPULSES
IN NEW POETS
By ALEXANDER CRAIG
New Impulses in Australian Poetry.
Edited by Rodney Hall and Thomas
W. Shapcott. University of Queens-
land Press. $2.75.
THE APPEARANCE of this anthology
is an important literary event. It ought
to have been a momentous one. How-
ever, it isn’t quite that. The book’s
mainly valuable because it offers the
reader, for a reasonable price, at least
eight poems each by half a dozen of the
best Australian poets born in or since
the 19205: Vincent Buckley, Gwen Har-
wood, Francis Webb, Chris Wallace-
Crabbe, R. A. Simpson, and even Ran-
dolph Stow (I say “even,” because his
inclusion by these two editors is some-
thing of a surprise, though certainly a
pleasant one). Jacaranda Press’ attrac-
tive “Eight by Eight” of 1963 (still in
print) has comparable selections by
Buckley, Wallace-Crabbe, and Simpson,
but here the reader gets 22 poems for
his money, not eight. He also gets
Buckley’s “Eleven Political Poems”
sequence entire, which can be called a
bargain enough in itself. Though these
impressive poems of Buckley’s had much
influence among poets, they’re far from
being just poets’ poems: their concen-
trated intensity, recalling Robert
Lowell’s, isn’t so wholly, personally con-
fessional. Buckley, anyway, is very much
his own man. Only a couple of these
pieces are in any way adventurous
metrically: all possess a tense, alive,
contemporary quality and, though indi-
vidual, a sort of general intuition and
awareness which all men can share.
Simpson’s poems are now usually “tradi-
tional” in shape (it wasn’t always so),
but their forceful self-portraiture and
their modern, urban preoccupations
often reverberate beyond the formal,
physical limits. It’s good to find this
unique, incisive poet fairly substantially
represented.
Bruce Dawe can be seen at his col-
loquial best in much of his large group,
particularly in “The Flashing of
Badges” a personal favorite of mine
among Dawe’s poems and in the
powerful “And a Good Friday Was Had
by All”
Bruce Beaver’s bluff, slightly discur-
sive but engaging verse deserves a better
selection than these editors manage:
only “A Falling Sickness” and the three
small “Aquarelles” really do him
justice.
There’s a good poem by Andrew
Taylor, one of the finest of the younger
poets (he’s only allowed one). Evan
Jones seems to be slighted with a single
poem, and though Jones wouldn’t let
two of his earlier pieces be used, this
may, in fact, be so. It’s his later poems
that are so often both concrete and
moving. The two poet-editors gener-
ously give one another nine and ten
poems apiece!
Rodney Hall’s earlier poems those
into the early ’sixties were certainly
among the most exciting and promising
to appear in this country: Judith Wright
correctly characterised their “whiplash
swiftness of visualisation and percep-
tion,” their “refusal to verbalise and
approximate.” Now, Hall has become
an attenuated, mannered poet, more
modish (at times, like a less-gutsy Ted
Hughes) and, unfortunately, a good
deal more diffuse. The typical Aus-
tralian poet writes a good line, then
adds three or four lines explaining it:
not trusting the reader, he dilutes any
poetic force with a watery, discursive
prosiness (R. D. Fitzgerald is often a
poet of that kind, Les A. Murray, a
talented newcomer, similarly weak-
Hall...a mannered poet?
ened). Hall has become typically Aus-
tralian in this respect.
Also, even Hall’s ocassional better
poems (as well as his worst) can be
too frequently flawed by sudden lapses
in tone, by digressions into a wholly
inappropriate diction. Three of his ten
poems, “Tree-Children,” “Dark After-
noons She Spent,” and “The In-
vaders,” are relatively less crippled by
his usual faults.
Hall shares with Thomas W. Shap-
cott a desire, now and then, to make
classical statues walk (and in modern
dress!), but their thick overlay of dust
stays on them, and they don’t
move (in any sense). Nor do the
historical poems come to life. More
often, Shapcott will start a poem very
well and end it badly: the initial im-
mediacy’s dissipated in commonplace
ruminations or by a highly unoriginal
ending; the pace is retarded or
the rhythm trite (e.g. his “Aubade” in
this book). His seems a pleasant, poetic
personality: however, he’s not afraid
of “a full look at the worst.” He per-
forms most successfully over short
distances. His three best poems here
are sonnets, two of them charming
but slight, yet the third, “Flying
Fox,” is one of the best poems in the
anthology a taut, dramatic piece
with a flexible rhythm and strong,
functional imagery.
I’ve taken the editors at their own
valuation, as far as space is concerned.
Others deserve more. That excellent
poet Gwen Harwood and also Wallace-
Crabbe (whose Audenesque “A Wintry
Manifesto,” however, the editors over-
praise) I’ve commended previously,
while Webb’s rich, untidy, original,
and profound poetry has long been
fairly widely known: the anthology
serves all three well enough (though
it avoids Gwen Harwood’s few experi-
mental poems).
Hall and Shapcott make a presump-
tuous, unsupported assertion that the
close friendship between Jones and
Wallace-Crabbe “hindered rather than
helped their own individual talents”:
other writers happen to think the as-
sociation was a mutually fruitful one.
The tone of the introduction and the
“biocriticisms” (an idea borrowed
from “The Penguin Book of Australian
Verse”) is, to say the least, unfortunate.
Ignore the prose and read the poetry,
to get the most pleasure from this
book. Also, try to disregard the title.
The title can only be called mislead-
ing, particularly since the epigraph
taken from Gwen Harwood dis-
parages those “fitting old shapes to
old ideas, rocked by their classical
harmonies in living sleep.”
The editors contradicted this by dis-
daining “surface . . . experiment”:
however, they also talk about “break-
ing fresh ground,” “developing in a
fresh direction,” “new excitements.”
When Hall and Shapcott aren’t kidding
themselves, they’re fighting a battle
that was won overseas long ago. A
better title for much of this anthology,
in fact, would be “Old Impulses in
New Poets.” Except for the presence
of Stow and a handful of poems by
other poets, this is generally a “main-
stream” anthology, quite conservative
as far as a world poetry in English
is concerned. The editors even give
four pages to David Rowbotham (who
wrote to The Bulletin, some time ago,
claiming that he doesn’t know what
such lines as pentameters and tetra-
meters are: this is unfortunate, because
he uses them a lot particularly the
pentameters). Rowbotham’s actually
something of a poetic reactionary,
affecting a “plain man” approach to-
ward poetry and criticism: to bor-
row the words of Dennis Donoghue in
another connection, he “deals with the
problems of modern language by buy-
ing a plot of ground and keeping them
out.”
Certainly, much of this manifesto and
documentation of “the rising ortho-
doxy” (Hall’s and Shapcott’s own term)
isn’t likely to hearten such poets as
the one who wrote to the present critic


last year, saying: “most . . . poetry
published reinforces the idea that poems
must he ‘regular’ in order to be printed.”
There’s a close relation between a
new form and a really new subject-
matter. Also, the editors, to a large
extent, equate “new impulses” with a
sociological subject-matter which
they prescribe. They attempt to fore-
stall honest and pertinent criticism by
boasting about “editorial bias,” by dog-
matic pronouncements, arrogant or
complacent assertions and counter-
assertions.
They’re patronising about Simpson’s
period as a Poetry Editor of The
Bulletin, comparing him to his disad-
vantage with Buckley: he simply edited
in a different way from Buckley, achiev-
ing variety and flexibility surely as.
important as a “firm sense of ... an
inter-relationship between all the poems
used”? Simpson printed some of Hall’s
best poems and, without making a t
feature of it as Hall does in “The
Australian,” was more successful at dis-
covering “new poets.”
Stow almost seems to have got into
the anthology by accident or to have
been included (along with Taylor) to
give a touch of catholicity to the con-
tents, a sort of poetical window-dress-
ing. Hall and Shapcott allow Stow
almost as many poems as they do one
another, but appear to have no notion
of what he’s about in his later work.
Some of his “poems,” they say, “. . .
tend to disintegrate into an almost hys-
terical emotionalism, at the same time
losing any precision of imagery.” Pre-
cision, indeed! Stow’s poetry, I think,
is irrational by choice, without being
at all surrealistic: it has its own
emotionally charged sort of precision:
. . . the tribes, like smoke,
seep campward.
Stow’s images, though they certainly
“derive . . . from his own soil” (the
editors’ words), take on an inwardness,
because he’s concerned with a shared
subjectivity: this requires a different,
more-intuitive manner of seeing and
feeling from the objectively presented
framework of individual experience
that’s the basis of most of the other
poems in this book. It isn’t really an
autobiographical, particular subjectiv-
ity but pertains to everybody, which is
why I call it “shared” in the same
way as we can know and share life in
our objective environment. Stow is the
anthology’s only wholehearted represen-
tative of this truly “new impulse”: now
part of a cosmopolitan English-language
poetry, it’s also a spontaneous growth
from within our intricate Australian
humus. Taylor has a touch of it,
Murray occasionally shows it strongly
(in some fine parts of “Spring and
Hail,” which, however, he spoils with
a childish two-line refrain and a super-
fluous closing verse-paragraph).
Although it also carries a few passen-
gers for friendship’s sake, this is in many
respects a very good anthology, as I
began by saying. However, new im-
pulses of the kind I’ve tried to describe
made much of it old before it went to
the printer.
THIS TIME, NO FIRE
Left, James Baldwin ...above, LcRoi Jones
By JOHN BAXTER
The Furious Passage of James Baldwin.
Fern Marja Eckman. Michael Joseph.
$4.90.
Home: Social Essays. Leßoi Jones.
Macgibbon and Kee. $4.25.
THE NEGRO “thing,” like the Viet-
nam “thing,” is very big in publishing
at the moment, a fact on which both
Leßoi Jones and James Baldwin com-
ment in these two generally dissimilar
books. Bearing this in mind, one
wonders if it occurred to them that
their opportunity to be heard has more
to do with fashion than literary worth.
To the detached reviewer, it is difficult
to see why either book was published.
Such material by or about any white
writer would be returned within the
week with some scarifying reader’s
comments.
Fern Marja Eckman’s ambitious tome
is an attempt to get under the skin
of a man whom, it is obvious from her
approach, she considers to be equal
parts literary phenomenon, social critic,
friend, and saint. Adapting the tech-
nique of the television documentary, in
which an extended interview with the
subject is juxtaposed with outside com-
ments, flashbacks, and editorial obser-
vations, Miss Eckman attempts to con-
trast Baldwin’s present eventful life with
the tangled childhood, tortured ado-
lescence and brief literary career which
preceded it. The experiment is a failure.
What she really gives us is a grotesque
parody of the American personality
cult with Baldwin as her chief victim.
One would have to be made of stone
not to find much of the book hilarious,
especially the curious disparity between
Baldwin’s early life and his memory of
it.“lf he says so, it must be so,” he
says of one, Carpenter’s recollection.
“Carpenter, Carpenter . . .” He shakes
his head and says without conviction,
“That name sounds familiar . . .” And
after a former associate has mentioned
Baldwin’s devotion to a favorite Eng-
lish teacher, . . . the writer greeted the
story with a blank stare. Struggling to
place her, he asks, “Was she a Negro?”
This conflict continues throughout the
book, making one wonder just how
much of the remaining material is
similarly suspect. Miss Eckman does
not, however, share our doubts. Pausing
only to remark that “Baldwin’s memory
plays tricks on him,” she races on in
the wake of her idol’s “furious passage.”
Baldwin’s life in Europe, where he
retreated after his difficult adolescence,
gets little attention, mainly because he
obviously found it a useful but un-
comfortable experience. Miss Eckman
has little comment to make, and for
the first time one has a chance to see
Baldwin without the rose-colored aura
his biographer constructs round him.
These chapters probably bring us closer
to the real Baldwin, a new writer un-
sure of his talent and himself. It isn’t
hard to picture the ugly young Negro
sharing grubby apartments in Mont-
martre, finding that la vie boheme is
largely a matter of hunger, vermin,
and despair. Nor does one have to be
a writer to appreciate the irony of walk-
ing miles in the rain to pick up a long-
awaited parcel from home, only to find
it containing a few dozen lamentably
non-negotiable copies of his new book.
But Miss Eckman is not concerned
with this aspect of her hero’s life. She
has manufactured a persona for him
which must, under all circumstances, be
retained, no matter how much it con-
flicts with the facts. The subject of her
portrait is Baldwin the revolutionary,
the unflinching critic of a corrupt social
structure. Variously described as “salt
rubbed in the wounds of the nation’s
conscience,” “the shriek of the lynched,”
and “a fierce, brilliant light illuminat-
ang the unspeakable and the shameful,”
the real Baldwin makes a brave attempt
to reach her high standards, but fails
miserably. At best, he seems a moder-
ately talented writer who has been
forced into the untenable position of
Negro leader by a combination of well-
meant outside influence and amiable
ignorance within.
Leßoi Jones is in no such doubt as
to his role in the Negro struggle. He
is the hammer of white men, the raging
symbol of Negro hatred and rebellion.
Formed by roughly the same pressures
as Baldwin, he has emerged as an
entirely different sort of man, a direct,
forceful, often profane polemicist, whose
street speeches and fiery magazine
pieces have kept him continually before
the public. In jail on charges relating
to the recent Negro riots, he can be
heard in good voice, nevertheless, in

“Home,” a selection from his sparse
output of articles and public addresses.
All this said, it must also be recorded
that Jones, despite his quality as a
speaker, is no writer, although his
rhetoric is blunt and colorful, reminis-
cent of Lenin in both style and con-
tent. “If you want a new world, Brothers
and Sisters,” he says, “if you want a
world where you can all be beautiful
human beings, we must throw down
our differences and come together *as
black people. And once we have done
this, you know for yourself, there is no
force on earth that can harm or twist
us.” Not bad for a soapbox in front of
a New York hotel. But this is Jones’
peak. In his meagre literary output he
never achieves even a shadow of this
vitality. His comments deserve to be
recorded, but not as they are in this
book, in the form of pseudo-essays
which demand consideration as litera-
ture. Frankly, they are just not good
enough.
What I find most interesting and
alarming about these two books is
the total failure of both to put forward
any coherent argument on the present
white/black confrontation in America.
Fern Marja Eckman quotes Baldwin at
length on the problems of his people,
most of it in wearisome epigraphs to
each chapter, but on analysis his views
resolve themselves into a series of
empty slogans. “I don’t think people
go around looking for sexual fulfilment.
They go around looking for love.” Or
“My own apprehension of my own life
is that it’s up to me to do it, to live
it, to discover it . . .” Despite Miss
Eckman’s indefatigable italicising, these
pronouncements can usually be boiled
down into the simplest form of senti-
mental sophistry. Of course, other
views are possible. One American
reviewer suggested recently that Bald-
win should never forgive white men for
making him write as he does. Or, all
sophistry is not necessarily simple.
In his essays, Baldwin has raised some
provocative questions, but most of them
stem from an exaggerated response to
white hatred and discrimination. It is
easy to recoil from this into the sort
of philosophy expressed by Baldwin in
“The Fire Next Time” as “Who wants
to be integrated into a burning building,
anyway?” And while the point of view
expressed by both Baldwin and Jones
that the Negro has become for white
male Americans a walking phallic sym-
bol and threat to his masculinity is
somewhat more subtle, its source is
still in ernotion rather than logic.
Their assertion may be true, but the
sexual attitude of Negroes to whites
betrays weaknesses of a related kind.
We are none of us immune from
charges of turpitude in this matter,
except perhaps Miss Eckman’s saintly
Baldwin.
If one ignores the feeble contribu-
tions made by Jones and Baldwin to
social commentary, the bulk of their
work seems meagre indeed. Jones’
violent play “Dutchman” is unremark-
able by modern standards, while Bald-
win’s novels and plays are, with the
possible exception of the early, deeply
felt “Giovanni’s Room,” pale carbons
of other men’s work. One wonders if
the idea of a Negro novelist or essayist
is not impossible per se. Both forms
are, after all, patterned closely on the
linear “print culture” thinking which
dominates Western life. If Negro
writers choose to work in these fields
they can hardly expect to do anything
but fail.
Jones seems occasionally to hold this
view, and “A Dark Bag,” his essay on
modern Negro poetry, both American
and African, hints at an acceptance of
the Negro as being motivated by a
different impulse to the white, but anger
at his oppressors obscures what truth
this assumption may have. “Only a
united Black Consciousness can save
the Black People from annihilation at
the white man’s hands,” he says. May-
be. But surely it is a corollary that only
a united Black Literature can keep
alive this Black Consciousness. The
works offered by Baldwin and Jones,
feeble attempts at aping the white
traditions of style and attitude, are less
than a halting step toward this.
JANUARY 27, 1837
Shattered, a shot rabbit,
He fell kicking in snow,
Lost consciousness, came to,
Dragged himself up on his cloak,
Ate snow to clear his head.
Fainted again. Quick
As ink on blotting-paper
The nibbling bloodstain spread:
Raised himself on both arms,
Steadied the pistol, aimed,
For two full minutes, they say.
Waiting, D’Anthes stood
Sideways, arms over his heart.
A long time it must have seemed.
To watch the barrel sway,
Wavering, steadying
The shot knocked D’Anthes down.
Pushkin cheered, threw up
The pistol, fainted again.
“Have 1 killed him?” “No.”
He lived another two days
After they got him home.
Toward the end he shrieked
Without stopping, all the time.
Two pounds of clotted blood
And many pieces of bone
(His pelvis being shattered)
Were taken from his groin.
Next day by word of mouth
All the city knew of his death.
He was buried in secret
For fear of rioting.
Yellow, monkey-faced
He developed his chest with weights.
Knowing how to hate
He practised recklessness, will,
And lived in passion, straight on
An arrow, all bent to one end.
His wife was a fashionable fool.
He himself provoked the duel.

NEW 'TIMES" ATLAS
By FRANK ROBERTS
The Times Atlas of the World. Times
Newspapers Ltd. $29.50.
THE PREVIOUS, Mid-Century Edi-
tion of The Times Atlas ran to five
volumes, which had certain obvious dis-
advantages. This new, one-volume Com-
prehensive Edition, only a little larger
and heavier than a well-stuffed briefcase,
is manageable in size, weight, and price.
It has 122 double-page maps showing
every country in the world in detail, so
that its readers can see the essential
geographical layouts immediately.
The publisher’s claim that it “is indis-
pensable to the understanding of world
events” seems accurate in that a “gazet-
teer” of perhaps a quarter of a million
place names enables one to locate the
centre of interest on the appropriate
map (of, say, Africa, China, Vietnam,
the U.S.A.) within seconds, see at a
glance the related topography includ-
ing ocean surrounds and then, by
reference to earlier maps, details of
climate, vegetation, population density.
Some of the front-of-the-book maps
have their own special appeal, showing,
for instance, the world in maps which
show food production and consumption
breakdowns, water resources, power and
energy, minerals, climate, and food
potential. Star charts, maps of the moon,
sections about satellites and space flight
enrich the information.

ISABELLA, THE
FRAUD OF
ENGLISH COOKERY
STERLING devalued . . . withdrawal
symptoms (east of Suez) ... a sagging
Union Jack feebly blowing in the
breeze, incapable of intimidating an
aging de Gaulle . . . Harold wilting at
the helm . . . the Ashes once again
beyond recall . . . and, finally, the idol
of the British kitchen establishment,
Mrs. Isabella Beeton, is proved to have
feet of pastry!
The Empire is crumbling, indeed.
An English cookery expert, Fanny
Cradock, after reading Nancy Spain’s
“The Beeton Story,” did some serious
research on this best known of English
cooks. To her horror she discovered
that instead of being a middle-aged
Victorian wife and mother, well
upholstered and starch-aproned, work-
ing away in a vast kitchen, surrounded
by gleaming pots and pans, iron stock-
pots, and brass jam kettles, her (and
our) heroine was in fact in her early
twenties when she wrote her now-
famous cookery book, and died in her
28th year, in 1864.
It has been established that she had
a sheltered, comfortable upbringing,
and devoted most of her studies to
music lessons given by the famous
Sir Julius Benedict, “probably the most
fashionable (and certainly the most
expensive) music master of his .day.”
At the age of 19 she was betrothed
to publisher Sam Beeton, whose health
was not the best, which caused her
some distress. The records show that
“she set her extraordinary talent to
learn everything she could about the
management of houses, cooking, and
sick-nursing she even took lessons
in pastry-making from a confectioner
in Epsom.”
This move met with scant enthusiasm
from her family, as it “was considered
ultra-modern and not quite nice.”
Her family clearly had no inkling at
this crucial time of the conception of
any book, or that Isabella was interested
in anything more than a little hurried
cookery tuition, of the kind taken by
so many millions of intending brides.
In fact, it is recorded that “she filled
her days with concerts, piano practice,
visits to the Crystal Palace, and a local
round of dinner parties . . . these
and a keen interest in racing positively
overshadowed her life.”
So, while still apparently absorbed
with the racing calendar, the arbiter
elegans of home-making was known to
dash off a note to her fiance, pleading,
“don’t call me untidy, pray,” and left
him to buy and prepare their future
home.
Sam thus moved in with gardeners
and furniture while Isabella merely
wrote, “I have no partiality for any-
thing in particular except mignonette
55
The Bride’s Best Friend left him to it,
hard pressed as he was with the
demands of his publishing business.
He wrote her a pathetic little note,
saying, “what with pots and potatoes,
Grates and Greens, Fenders and
Scrapers ... I am thoroughly
exhausted.”
When all was ready the marriage
took place, and, after a honeymoon in
Europe, they took possession of their
house, complete with cook, kitchenmaid,
housemaid, her sister Lucy, and a plur-
ality of gardeners (Sam Beeton subse-
quently published a very authoritative
work on gardening).
In the first year of her marriage,
while giving birth to, and burying, her
first child, it is assumed that she laid
the foundations of the book that was
to enshrine the history of English
Cookery.
These “foundations” become increas-
ingly suspect when we assess the
evidence.
The Beetons once stayed with a
Mr. and Mrs. English at Newmarket.
Mrs. English, when asked, considered
that Mrs. Beeton was not competent
to write a cookery book; and later went
so far as to write her a letter: “. . . I
see difficulties in your way as regards
Publishing a Book on Cookery. Cookery
is a science that is only learned by
Long Experience and years of study,
which, of course, you have not had.
There, my advice would be to compile
a Book of Receipts from a Variety of
the Best Books Published on Cookery,
and Heaven knows there is a great
variety for you to choose from.”
From that day on Mrs. Beeton had
two years and one month left in which
to create, test, and write 2751 pages
of small, closely spaced print, and to
commission 500 wood engravings, and
50 colored plates an unlikely possi-
bility.
The fact is that Sam Beeton then
launched an appeal in his “English
Woman’s Domestic Magazine” for
recipes. “We shall,” he wrote, “be
exceedingly obliged to any lady who
will spare us a few minutes to write ,
out for us some of her choice recipes
and thus make the ‘English Woman’s
Domestic Magazine’ a means whereby
her knowledge and skill may be com-
municated to the world.” We learn
that the response was amazing, and the
bulk of his wife’s book obviously came
from this appeal.
It is not recorded whether Mrs.
Beeton ever visited Australia, though
it is more than improbable. However,
she assures us in her book that her
Australian dishes Kangaroo Tail
Soup, Roast Wallaby, Parrot Pie, and
Pumpkin Pie are quite authentic.
I wonder which famous lady in our
land found time to send the recipes to
poor old Sam and how the lady in
question managed to get a kangaroo
tail, a wallaby, and a dozen parakeets
to the kitchens of Isabella, enabling
her to “personally create and test each
recipe before publication.”


Letters
Petrol prices
In “In Defence of ‘Profiteering’ ” (8.,
July 27), Peter Samuel said “petrol has
not, since 1949, been subject to public
price controls . . .” The fact is that
price control on petrol was maintained
throughout Australia until December,
1954, and since then has continued
without interruption in South Australia.
In New South Wales it was reimposed
in February, 1959, and is still in force.
Petrol prices in Queensland were under
control up to February, 1967. Unifor-
mity of petrol prices from brand to
brand in most States reflects the con-
tinued existence of price control rather
than what Mr. Samuel called “private
collusion” by the oil companies.
His reference to 1949 suggests that
he was thinking of petrol rationing,
which was successfully challenged in
the High Court in that year, reintro-
duced under new legislation in October,
and finally abolished in February, 1950.

Melbourne's Underground
In regard to your article on the city
undergrounds (8., July 27), I would
like to correct some of the information.
Firstly, “The Melbourne proposal is for
a loop line within the central business
district to improve delivery and pick-up
of passengers from the existing suburban
network, on which no extensions are
planned.” The Victorian Railways
“Newsletter” of March, 1964, outlines
the Commissioners’ plans in regard to
extensions of the electrified suburban
service. As housing development
proceeds outward four sections will be
electrified. Plans have also been pre-
pared to extend the Altona line by two
miles to a new station at Westona, and
to build a high-speed railway from
Glenroy to the jetport at Tullamarine.
Secondly, the author says, “The
heavily trafficked southern and eastern
lines just don’t have the capacity to
carry more trains. This is because over
most of their length they are only two
tracks.” The Victorian Railways Com-
misisoners have made it quite clear that
they will provide additional trackage
at the same time as the underground
is being built. To provide this trackage
now would only be using funds which
can be used elsewhere to better advan-
tage, as in most cases the existing
number of tracks can handle the traffic.
When the underground comes into
operation the traffic will rise and only
then will it be necessary to have the
extra tracks. In the VR Newsletter of
March, 1964, the Commissioners out-
lined their 'many proposals in this
regard.
Thirdly, in Mr. Samuel’s article is a
statement saying that the clearance at
Flinders Street station is the only
obstacle preventing the operation of
double-deck cars on the Melbourne
suburban system. A headroom of 6’3” is
desirable on both decks and the VR
loading gauge height of 14 feet does
not permit this, without raising the
height of the cantenary (electric wires)
over the entire system. Also tracks
would have to be lowered beneath
bridges, and in the tunnels on the lines
from Princes Bridge. As an alternative,
the VR are increasing the length of
suburban trains from seven to eight
cars, and extending platforms. Tenders
have been invited for the construction
of new suburban trains to be of six
75-foot cars.
Melbourne has a first-class suburban
rail system, which, when linked to the
underground loop, will be able to
handle double the number of passengers
it now carries. The underground will
open up the whole northern area of
the city for more intensive redevelop-
ment. To build Melbourne’s 16 track-
miles of underground railway will cost
$BO million. The same amount would
build only twenty miles of freeway.
Also, experts point out that one single-
track railway can carry more people in
one hour than eight lanes of freeway.

Stockbrokers
As a member of what your Brian
Hoad describes as “the affluent club,”
I read with interest and amusement
his article “Stockbrokers Your money
in their hands” (8., August 3). In
the first place, basing an aggregate
of $25 million on a turnover of $B6O
million is sheer rubbish. How much
of this comprises Commonwealth Loans,
on which the maximum brokerage of
25 cents per $lOO reduces to a mere
3 cents per $100? How much represents
arbitrage and interstate business, oper-
ated on very low margins and at never
more than l-3rd of 2 percent on a
broker-to-broker basis? Probably 50 per-
cent of Sydney’s industrial and mining
turnover is covered by these categories.
With few exceptions, we do not re-
gard ourselves as commission agents
with an eye to encouraging business
for the ’mere sake of increasing income,
but as a way of life. All of us, with the
exception of non-member partners
recently admitted to operate in the
South, were in comfortable circum-
stances before being admitted to our
Exchanges.
Competition is the life blood of the
industry. Amalgamation, of the Ex-
changes would produce restricted
bidding with more dominance, already
too heavy, by the larger firms. Other
Exchanges, not mentioned by Mr.
Hoad, are doing a very fine job and
we do not want any further concen-
tration of financial dominance in either
Sydney or Melbourne.
During the past six months all
brokers have experienced difficulty in
obtaining deliverable transfers, but,
where it has been due to the brokers’
staffs being unable to cope, it emanates
from the larger houses that Mr. Hoad
champions. The greatest bottleneck
has been caused by the Companies’
registrars, who just could not obtain
the trained staff.
The Rules of my Exchange are
strictly policed and I could be
accused of and penalised for advertis-
ing if my name appears to this letter,
so I will ask you to refrain from
publishing it.

What is a degree worth?
As a third-year student in the combined
Arts-Law course at Sydney University,
I would like to make a few comments
on your article “What is an Arts degree
worth?” (8., July 13.)
I think the whole approach of assess-
ing the value of an Arts degree by see-
ing what people do with it is wrong.
A course in this faculty, obviously and
intentionally, does not prepare men
and women for any particular profes-
sion. But it still gives them something
of inestimable value a liberal educa-
tion and a training in how to think
which will stand them in good stead in
whatever field they work.
My advice to those who do find them-
selves part of the highly educated un-
employed is to do what they would
have done if they had not gone to
university. If necessary, seek profes-
sional or technical training after doing
their Arts course. But do not dispense
with that invaluable first degree, if
time and finance allow it. To my mind,
it is a great pity that all members of
our community cannot have this
experience.

National development
I must congratulate Mr. Samuel on his
handling of a reputedly esoteric and
complex topic in “The High Art of
Anti-development” (8., June 29). But
to be effective, Australia’s develop-
ment policies should be more integ-
rated. The left hand should know what
the right hand is doing. Not neces-
sarily by means of a master plan com-
piled by “technocrats,” for to some this
has irrational socialistic connotations.
Admittedly such a body may be econ-
omically more efficient, but given the
existing political framework and cur-
rent philosophy of those holding power
makes any such thoughts idealistic.
When the Vernon Committee suggested
this idea in 1965 it was conveniently
pigeonholed, under the pretext of lead-
ing to a “society of government by
technocrats.”
The numerous existing policy-making
bodies, such as Cabinet, the Reserve
Bank, and the Arbitration and Concilia-
tion Commission, are not in a position,
individually, to formulate an integrated
economic policy, for obvious political
and legal reasons. These and similar
bodies undertake policy decisions with
only minimal consideration of the

impact each has on the other. The
dichotomy between Commonwealth and
State policy bodies only adds to the
confusion. The establishment of regional
planning bodies may be one solution,
but this may lead quickly to excessive
bureaucracy and gross inefficiency.

ALP's heritage
“The racial heritage of the (ALP)
movement . . .” on which Mr. Clyde
Holding was misquoted (8., August 17)
should have been, of course, “the
radical heritage.”
Pharmaceutical benefits
The article headed, “Pharmaceutical
Benefits Certain Excesses” (8.,
August 17) contains several inaccuracies.
It is completely incorrect to say that
research involved “flooding the market
with something like a hundred new
drugs each year.” In the 28 years from
1940-1967 a total of 848 new drugs
was introduced.
Since 1962, the numbers each year
have been 1962 —24; 1963—16; 1964 —
17; 1965—23; 1966—12; 1967—25.
Of the new drugs introduced during
the 28-year period, 531 have come from
the United States; 57 from Switzerland;
41 from Germany; 39 from the United
Kingdom; 22 from France; 11 from
Denmark, and ten each from Sweden
and Mexico. Other countries’ new drugs
are below the figure of ten.
We must also disagree with your
statement that drug prices have escal-
ated. In 1962 the average price per
prescription in Australia was $2.01
in 1967 the average price per prescrip-
tion in this country was $1.94.
I would point out further that in its
evidence to the Sainsbury Committee,
which the British Government set up to
inquire into the relationship of the
pharmaceutical industry and the British
National Health Service, the Council of
the British Medical Association stated
that pharmaceutical advertising was
necessary and emphasised that advertis-
ing to doctors was directed to an
informed readership whose medical
training had “developed a critical and
inquiring attitude.” In its evidence the
Council stated that in a survey among
3535 doctors practising throughout
London, Scotland, and Northern
Ireland replies showed that 86 percent
of the doctors saw medical representa-
tives “almost always.” Only 0.4 percent
replied “hardly ever.”
Referring to new preparations, 81
percent of the doctors surveyed stated
they preferred to get this information
from medical representatives.

It only took about 5000° F to
'weld' this meteorite into shape.
That's the temperature reached by
meteorites, missiles and machines entering
our atmosphere. But let's get down to earth.
Arc welding requires a lot more heat.
Around 10,000°F. And it's a lot more
convenient. Arc welding has modernized
thought and action. See how it has caused
changes in design and manufacture in every
phase of engineering. Today's oil finds, for
instance, are being stored in tanks of all-
welded construction. Pipelines and ships,
bridges and automobiles—EMF arc
welding makes it happen. Improved EMF
arc welding electrodes are also on the job.
In giant manufacturing plants and small
factories ...used by tradesmen and handy-
men. With new metals and new techniques
appearing every day, we are engaged in a
continual programme of testing and
research. And if ever the day comes that
some new process replaces arc welding
...you'll hear about it first from us.
