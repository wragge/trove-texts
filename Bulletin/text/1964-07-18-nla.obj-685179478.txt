TO THE
EDITOR
THE COMMUNIST CONGRESS
Sir,
In the report by your Sydney corres-
pondent on the 20th Congress of the
Communist Party of Australia (4/7/64)
it was stated that Mr Yasnev and myself
had been “standing in for” the absent
Soviet delegation. Being foreign corres-
pondents, we covered the proceedings of
the congress as we are used to report
on other political developments in Aus-
tralia to the Soviet Press. We, as well
as some correspondents of Australian
Press, radio and TV, attended only the
opening sessions of the congress. Natu-
rally, we in no way stood and could not
stand in for the absent Soviet delegation.
It is difficult to comprehend why a
correspondent of such a reputable maga-
zine should resort to the apparent absur-
dity of trying to depict two foreign cor-
respondents fulfilling their professional
duty as a foreign delegation.

THE JEWS IN AUSTRALIA
Sir,
I fear that Alan Crown (4/7/64) has
either misread my article, “The Jews in
Australia” (20/6/64), or he is trying to
score some points. He claims I offered
“barely-polysyllabic” judgments (“con-
tradictory”, “ritualistic”) on an ancient
tradition. I offered no such judgments.
I did describe the kind of attachment to
that ancient tradition by many Austra-
lian Jews. I think it is “contradictory”
if a Jewish father insists that an ortho-
dox rabbi should perform his daughter's
wedding ceremony but then does not
mind if oyster patties are served at the
wedding breakfast. I think it is “ritualis-
tic” for a Jew to attend synagogue once
a year to recite a memorial prayer in
Hebrew which he can barely read, let
alone understand. This has nothing to
do with what I think of the “ancient
tradition” itself. Contradictory and
ritualistic are both in the dictionary.
Can Mr Crown say the same for “barely-
Polysyllabic”?
I should, I suppose, be heartened that
Mr Crown feels I have “demonstrated

that Australia’s Jews are normal people”.
I am concerned, however, that he feels
I should have stated this “explicitly.”
Why? I never intended to prove or
“demonstrate” anything. If Mr Crown
gets the feeling that Australia’s Jews are
“normal people” that might be good or
bad, depending on what he thinks “nor-
mal” means. My own belief is that
many Jews are not “normal” if by that
Mr Crown means the “same” as migrant
Italians, Germans or Slavs.
I know the word “grotesqueries” is
misused. Mr Crown could have been
charitable enough to assume that I used
the word as it is defined in the dictionary
—“embodiment of the whimsical”. As
it is he implies something sinister in my
use of it. There is something “whimsi-
cal” in the way many Jews who consider
themselves completely emancipated go
about “choosing” their friends and asso-
ciations. Somehow they nearly always
turn out to be Jewish. Mr Crown must
be jesting when he says this is “consider-
ed choice.” My whole point was that
for all sorts of reasons many Jews do
not “choose” their friends. They are
“chosen” for them by virtue of their be-
ing Jewish.
Finally, Mr Crown asks whether I
“seriously maintain that there is a Jewish
community in Australia any more socio-
logically homogeneous than the Christian
community”. Ido not maintain that at
all. I wrote an article for The Bulletin
in which I went to some pains to point
out that there was a very wide range
of diverse expressions of Jewishness in
Australia—so wide that I pointed out
that to speak of a Jewish community was
really an abstraction.

THE RADIO SERIALS
Sir,
Re the article headed “Soapless”
(“National Notebook,” 27/6/64). Your
correspondent has said that the removal
of Sydney’s last serials is not the end of
the world, as suggested by me when I
stated that it would be a death blow to
the whole industry, affecting production
companies, actors and script writers,
Certainly it won't be the end of the
world—there is a world outside that of
production companies, actors and script
writers. Certainly Sydney is not the
whole of Australia, but I repeat that if
production companies cannot find a Syd-
ney market for their programmes they
will be forced out of business—especially
as sales in other capitals are also difficult.
It is true that locally-made pro-
grammes are still sold overseas, and as
such are acceptable exports, but these
sales alone are insufficient to keep pro-
duction houses in business. Writers and
actors receive no additional payments
when radio programmes are sold over-
seas. Local actors are close to the bread-
line now. If local production of com-
mercial radio drama ceases entirely most
of them will have to give up being actors,
as television and stage do not provide
them with a living. The same applies to
writers. In this way, then, the removal
of Sydney’s last serials can be said to be
“the end of the world” for us—as actors
and writers of drama, unless local tele-
vision stations heed their obligations
under the Broadcasting and Television
Act, which directs them to provide “ade-
quate and comprehensive programmes”,
and “as far as possible to use the ser-
vices of Australians in the production
and presentation of broadcasting and
television programmes.”
I would also point out that “the
eternally ruminative soap operas” have,
of recent years, occupied less and less
space in the time devoted to radio
serials. The bulk of these serials for
several years now have been dramatisa-
tions of novels.

THE ASLF CONGRESS
Sir,
Your correspondent at this year’s
Australian Student Labor Federation
Congress (20/6/64) isolates two oppos-
ing groups: the “sensible social demo-
crats” and the “classical Marxists.”
Those in neither group are described as
politically immature; and the fact that, in
spite of the life and death struggle be-
tween Left and Right, students from
Canberra, Adelaide and Monash did not
always support the Right-thinking Mel-
bourne ALP Club is said to show “the
general poor state of Australian student
politics.”
This type of view is currently quite
prevalent on both the Right and the Left
at Australia's larger universities, and has
led to student politics becoming a com-
bat school for dogmatic, subjective and
vindictive factionalism, instead of an
apprenticeship in intelligent consideration
of political issues.

THE BEATLES
Sir,
Amongst all the pages, columns and
semi-columns written by the daily,
weekly and monthly Press about the
Beatles, your pen-picture (27/6/64)
comes about closest to portraying them
as they most probably really are. Whilst
not unduly critical of our century’s Pied
Pipers, your staff reporters nevertheless
were penetratingly analytical in report-
ing the Mopheads without being influ-
enced by mob hysteria.

fresh. Bright paint looks nice . . . but will it do
the job?
The John Deere “4020” Tractor illustrated above

green and yellow paint. But underneath John
Deere paint and polish is power . . . for maximum
productivity; reliability . . . from 127 years of

years of versatile and trouble-free operation. Power,
reliability and economy add up to performance.
Performance will do the job . . .

JEAN BATTERSBY
Brighton (Vic.),
Sir,
Congratulations to your magazine on
a wonderful, humorous report on the
Beatles, the high standard of which was
unfortunately lowered in the final stages
by the contribution of one Charles
Higham. Did he attend the concert
solely to knock the Beatles? He seemed
disappointed that the crowd behaved in
an orderly manner, and likened the at-
mosphere to an “old-folks’ benefit”.
His obviously predisposed critique was
tolerable until he stated that they evoke
“the loudest screams when they make
deliberately sexual gestures with their
phallic guitars”! To me it seems as
though Mr Higham suffers from a highly
over-imaginative mind.

AUSTRALIAN FILMS
Sir,
In his review of the Sydney Film Fes-
tival (27/6/64) Martin Long asks, “Why
can’t we (Australians) make films that
are at least half as good as those from,
say, Denmark?” Royal Commissions in
1927 and 1934 failed to find useful
answers to this question. One does not
need a Royal Commission, however, to
appreciate these facts: (a) The film is
the most cash-consuming artistic activity
yet developed by mankind (opera house
construction possibly excepted); (b) Aus-
tralian film production has never enjoyed
either sufficient or sustained capital in-
vestment —of more than a hundred film
companies formed since 1905 almost all
went out of business after making one or
two films; (c) the lack of regular employ-
ment suffered by our film-makers has
given them no opportunity for technical
or artistic development—even the few
overseas companies to make films here
in the last ten or twelve years have
brought out their own directors and
technical personnel; (d) there are only
three or four film-producing nations in
the world (Japan, India, the USA) that
have the populations to enable producers
to pay their own way; in all others
production is government-subsidised
except in Australia.
Some of the Australian shorts at the
Festival were made possible by enlighten-
ed sponsors that included such public
bodies as the ABC. That intermittent
sponsorship, however generous or en-
lightened, will never establish a film in-
dustry here was made clear at the forum
session, where an expert panel of four
(two film producers, a film critic and a
Senator —V. S. Vincent) discussed the
1963 Senate Select Committee Report on
Australian film production for television.
The Committee, of which Senator Vin-
cent was chairman, recognised in the re-
port that without regular feature-film pro-
duction there can be no real film indus-
try here, and, therefore, no hope of
Australians expressing themselves con-
fidently in this most powerful of all
communication media, let alone of pro-
jecting a vital Australian image before
the eyes of the world. In recommending
sustained government aid, along the lines
of the British Film Finance Corporation,
this report offers our film-makers a
new chance—the best in more than a
generation, and, perhaps, the last in this
century. The sad truth, however, is that
not one of its recommendations has yet
been acted upon. The Vincent Report
costs 4s. 6d. at Government Printing
Offices. Over a thousand copies of it
were published. My own check last
week showed that there were hundreds
of them still unsold.

JUDO
Sir,
Basically I agree with the sentiments
expressed in the article “So That's Judo?”
(13/6/64). I agree that Judo was not a
spectator sport as seen at the champion-
ships at the Stadium. The Australian
championships were run on a points sys-
tem, difficult if not impossible to follow
by spectators. Hence the dullness of
• the contests.
Judo is a spectator sport. It is exciting,
spectacular and fast. Not, I admit, when
organised on “Round Robin” lines as it
had to be for the championships. In
most other tournaments, we use the
ordinary elimination system, as in tennis,
when the loser in any contest is elimina-
ted. This puts every player on his mettle,
For the information of readers and
“Discus” I would like to state that Judo
is not a self-defence method as such.
It is purely a body contact sport, not
designed to maim, to render defenceless,
to kill—nor to be used as a defensive
measure against an attacker.
Finally, “Discus” is “not proud of an
Australian Olympic Squad, 200 strong,
mostly without a ghost of a chance of
winning . . .” Has he ever heard of the
founder of the modern Olympic Games,
Baron de Coubertin, and his “motto” for
the Games —that it is not important to
win, but to take part?

National Notebook
'Random Note
Mr Rupert Murdoch’s national news-
( paper, “The Australian”, makes its
(first appearance this week. We noted
with some fascination that “The Austra-
lian” has promised its readers: “If a
'fiddler plays a wrong note in Boston or
Bristol, ‘The Australian’ will know about
jit, If he does it twice, ‘The Australian’
will tell its readers.”
As Australia’s first national newspaper,
we would like to take this opportunity
of telling our readers that if a fiddler in
'Boston or Bristol plays two wrong notes
l'we don’t give a fig. And we don’t think
they do either.
Mediaeval Maiden
Miss Anna Volska has the distinction
of being the only student in her
pr at the National Institute of Drama-
tic Art to be earning, even approximately,
[a living at acting. Some of her fellow-
students, Miss Volska said, had had occa-
sional parts, others were teaching, or
(doing television commercials (“and prob-
ably are earning much more than I am”)
& working in shops.
\ But Miss Volska has led something of
a charmed life. Last year it was “The
Cherry Orchard”, “The
Fire Raisers” and Ophelia
in “Hamlet” at the Old
iTote. This year she was
(fa enchanting Katharine
<|i “Henry the Fifth”,
Een went into Robin
ovejoy’s lunch-time “A
resounding Tinkle”. Now she is appear-
ing in Brecht’s “The Caucasian Chalk
jCircle” at the Old Tote. In any language
Hand in any country this would be
Substantial professional experience for a
fi9-year-old actress in so short a time.
Unfortunately, the net result is that
Miss Volska intends to go to London in
pecember. She would like to stay in
London for four or five years, then come
Lack here. But —then Miss Volska be-
lies infected with the current depres-
sion affecting her fellow-actors.
L "I would like to come back —but not
f° a ‘nothing’ play,” she said. She talked
[ or a moment of Zoe Caldwell coming
jj ac L to a disastrous “St Joan”, and now
j e *th Michell coming back to a fairly
“The First Four Hundred
years”.
/
&ut when you are 19, pretty, talented
ai, d busy, decisions four or five years
jjiseem very remote. For the present,
"Lss Volska is simply delighted to be
0,1 stage at all. “I love the idea of
changing myself,” she said. “In ‘The
Caucasian Chalk Circle’ we’re all
peasants stamping around in the mud.
It’s a totally different world. And I
loved being Ophelia and Katharine.
Katharine, particularly. It’s wonderful
to be a princess, and be treated as a
princess, even for two hours a day.
And I have a special feeling for
mediaeval maidens.”
Girl Next Door
pV>R a singer, one of the disadvantages
of having a “girl-next-door” image
is that you are never quite sure what the
girl next door to the people in your
audience is like. Or so we were told
by Miss Leslie Uggams on her arrival in
Sydney for a three-week season at
Chequers.
She said she had no real complaints
about the cut of this suburban cloak
with which Mitch Miller had decked
her for his now near-defunct “Sing-
along” TV show. “The only thing is
that people who come along to my live
shows are often surprised that I can
sing songs other than the folksy ballads
I do with Mitch,” she said.
The 21-year-old Negress already has
12 years of show business experience
behind her. Starting at
the age of six with a part
in a family television
show, she made a number
of other television and
live appearances until, at
the age of 12, she retired.
Three years later she
made her comeback and it was not long
before she joined “Singalong”.
Miss The - name - doesn’t - make -
you - famous - you - make - it famous -
Uggams said she could not explain why
the “Singalong” show was being taken
off the air while still getting a fairly
high rating. “They said they wanted
to replace it with something a little new
and different —so they brought on
Alfred Hitchcock,” she said with a wry
smile.
When she finishes her current tour,
Miss Uggams will start rehearsing for
the first of six appearances on the Ed
Sullivan Show. Did she ever give herself
a holiday? “Occasionally; I had a day
off in Los Angeles last week.”

“The Pill”
rpHE Sydney “Catholic Weekly” declined
-*■ a Bulletin advertisement featuring
last week’s article “A Catholic Case for
the Pill”. The same advertisement was
accepted by “The Advocate”, Melbourne,
“The Catholic Leader”, Brisbane, “The
Southern Cross”, Adelaide, and “The
Record”, Perth. The “Catholic Weekly"
has accepted previous Bulletin adver-
tisements.
Opera House
rpms week’s cover is by Sydney artist
Mr Jim Phillips, who, so far, has
done between 30 and 40 paintings of the
Sydney Opera House. However, Mr
Phillips told us that “like most Sydney
people he is losing interest in the pro-
ject”. This painting was done mid-June,
the Australian Radio, Television and
Screen Writers’ Guild president, Richard
Lane. He assured us the prospects for
writers aimed at the viewing and listening
public was not so dark as one might
think.
“More than 80 professional writers
have joined the guild. To qualify they
need to be earning a substantial portion
of their income from radio, TV or
screen sources. Our dues are high, £l2
a year, but 1 think we have the majority
of writers enrolled with us. Of course
that doesn’t include those who are
primarily copy writers.”
Lane said he had been writing scripts
since the early days of radio. “Of course
I’m sorry to see the serials go. Not that
most of us who wrote them were so in
love with serials, but they did provide
continuity of income.”
What prospects were there for budding
script writers? “Well, the guild can help
by its support. We’ve been in existence
for three years and last year, on the
advice of Ted Willis—he’s Lord Willis
now —we registered as a trade union.
This gave us the right of affiliation with
the International Guild and reciprocal
agreements with the British and Ameri-
can bodies. We’ll be sending a delegate
to the international conference in
London this November.
“The guild’s existence has given us
status. Now TV producers can notify
the guild of their requirements. We can
notify our members that a certain studio
will be needing scripts of such and such
a length on such and such a subject. I
think the producers appreciate this.
Anyway, they are co-operating in the
seminar. TCN’s Bob Raymond and
David Cahill of ATN both addressed
the opening session. We've also man-
aged to raise payment. Of course the
‘Jonah’ serial fell through when we
demanded residual payment for over-
seas sales and replays. The actors
spearheaded that, but we supported
them.”
Lane agreed that the number of
experienced local writers was not
impressive. “But our writers can only
enter world class when they are able to
write continuously and gain experience.”
Did he think it was justifiable for them
to use local listeners and viewers as
guinea pigs on which to learn? He
smiled and said that this was “a curly
one”, but stoutly maintained that there
were sufficient experienced local people
to justify development of local writers.
The ABC had proved that, he said. A
recent children’s serial dealing with
outer space had been bought by Screen
Gems.
“We have plenty of people interested
in developing their know-how,” Lane
said. “Besides our active membership
we have a large associate membership
comprising people with script writing
ambitions. The seminar (at £6 6s. to
non-members) has been a sell-out— most
of them new faces and at least half of
them women.”

PLAIN ENGLISH
The London Conference
rpHE most pungent comment on
the Commonwealth Conference
was the picture of Sir Robert Men-
zies and Jomo Kenyatta together—
the elder statesman, Parliamen-
tarian and Queen’s man with the
bearded African who, not so very
long ago, was described by a
colonial governor as leading Ken-
yans “to darkness”. And yet for
all that such a contrast implies it is
not enough for “A Conservative”
in the now famous London “Times”
letter to describe the Common-
wealth as a “gigantic farce”.
This is the language of the dis-
enchanted romantic who believes
that it would be a very good thing
if we were, once and for all, done
with the idle pretence that the
Commonwealth is an entity or that
it has force, power and cohesion.
It never did have or, if it did, it
vanished with the passing of the
“Old Commonwealth”.
It is now a loose structure of
independent nations comprising five
white States, seven African (with
more to come), four Asian and two
West Indian which do not form a
single trading area, have no col-
lective military power, do not and
cannot seek it, and which can in
no direct or imperative way bring
any force to bear on world prob-
lems. It is at the mercy of economic
and political strains of considerable
variety.
Divisions abound. Australia and
New Zealand look increasingly to
the United States while trying to
maintain their own national iden-
tity. Canada is already part of the
United States, however reluctantly.
India is non-aligned but virtually
at war with Red China. Judged on
its military budget, Pakistan is
virtually at war with India.
Malaysia, fighting for its existence
as a nation, looks vainly for support
to the African nations whose pre-
occupations are almost solely with
dwelling on the past sins of
colonialism and the racial inequities
of Southern Rhodesia and South
Africa.
And yet the Commonwealth has
managed to survive despite the
sudden weariness with it which has
become newly fashionable es-
pecially among British Conserva-
tives who, taking a good, hard
look at it during the Common
Market negotiations, found it ex-
pensive and expendable. It has
probably only stood positively for
one thing and that as a matter of
necessity, rather than as a matter
of idealism. It stands for multi-
racialism and must do so if it is not
to fall apart. The 1961 crisis over
South Africa proved that and if
South Africa had not left the Com-
monwealth it would have foundered.
It may still founder on the question
of apartheid and sanctions against
South Africa as Mr Albert Margai’s
bitter attack on Sir Robert Menzies
showed. Mr Kenyatta’s softer re-
joinder to Sir Robert over white
supremacy in Africa and his
ironic offer of troops and facilities
for British use in enforcing a “one-
man-one-vote” political democracy
in Southern Rhodesia was much in
the same vein. And yet if threatened
race war is potentially the most
explosive issue now existing in the
world, the London Conference
seems to be the ideal place to dis-
cuss it. Why? Because, to a sur-
prising extent, despite a diversity
of governments and conditions, the
member States share a common
language, common political institu-
tions and the rule of law. In some
the rule of the law and parliamen-
tary democracy do not run as far
as had been hoped years ago. But
they are still part and parcel of a
common experience which enable
the premiers to descend on London
for a week on an informal, uncom-
mitted basis to exchange ideas and
information, views and convictions.
If this is not valuable it is hard to
see why it is not so.
TN terms of hard cash benefits the
Commonwealth cannot offer
more than the facilities of a large
consultative body. But between the
member States there is an un-
rivalled flow of diplomatic and
other information which—as non-
members they would otherwise
find it expensive and difficult to
obtain. Trade preferences between
member States are not what they
used to be but are still substantial.
For all members there is relatively
easy access to the London loan
market and for the underdeveloped
members of the club there are the
facilities and resources of a score
of highly technical Commonwealth
Committees on subjects ranging
from Industrial Science to Agri-
culture. There are many who stoff
at these as being little better than
the facilities afforded by a superior
club.
But what is wrong with this? The
Commonwealth does not pretend
to be a force. It is not a power
bloc. It is not a little UN. Com-
posed of nations both wealthy and
poor, politically aligned and non-
aligned, of East and West, it is
not a strong institution and would
quickly fracture under the strains
imposed by trying to make it a
strong one. But until something
better comes along it remains a
very useful one.


THIS AUSTRALIA
THE COMMONWEALTH CONFERENCE
The Lonely Task
of Sir Alec
Being all things to all men?
From Alan Reid in London
DOUGLAS-HOME
Extraordinary meeting
At the end of Pall Mall, heart of Lon-
don’s clubland, stands Marlborough
House, massively impressive and redolent
of an era when Britain ruled the waves
and imposed the Pax Britannica on most
quarters of the globe. Last week it
housed what must be one of the most
extraordinary club gatherings in the
world—the meeting of the British Com-
monwealth Prime Ministers.
Through the imposing entry filed the
representatives of seven African nations
(Ghana, Nigeria, Sierra Leone, United
Republic of Tanganyika and Zanzibar,
Kenya, Uganda and Malawi); four
Asian nations (India, Pakistan, Malaysia
and Ceylon); two West Indian nations
(Jamaica and Trinidad); one Mediter-
ranean island (Cyprus); and four seg-
ments of the ethnic group that once rul-
ed the lot (Britain, Canada, Australia
and New Zealand).
The club had no common denominator
politically, geographically, or racially.
President Nkrumah of Ghana, complete
with the trappings of a bodyguard reput-
ed to number 20, a dictator and bene-
ficiary of a leadership cult, arrived with
two police outriders to pass through a
line of Ghanaian exiles protesting against
his authoritarian rule, to rub shoulders
with the representatives of long-estab-
lished democracies. Inhabitants of one-
time British-controlled gaols shook hands
with adherents of the regime that had
put them there.
The conference divided into three dis-
tinct sections, and as proceedings got
under way the sections became more
marked.
Firstly, there was Britain, the host
country, with its Prime Minister, Sir Alec
Douglas-Home, and its Government try-
ing to make some much needed mileage
with the British electorate in election
year with a revitalisation of the Com-
monwealth concept.
Britain’s role was rather pathetic.
Where once it thundered and others
quailed it now had to seek to be all things
to all men. It wanted to avoid discus-
sion on Southern Rhodesia in case a
section of the Government’s backbench-
ers in the House of Commons got the
impression that it was prepared to aban-
don the white minority government in
Southern Rhodesia to neighboring Afri-
can-ruled wolves. On the other hand,
it could not oppose holding such a dis-
cussion because to do so would be to
antagonise the African majority at the
conference and disregard the realities of
a situation which existed and could not
be ignored.
Secondly, there were the countries still
fighting the old imperialism, or believing
that they were, even though they them-
selves had thrown it off and were fully
independent. These were headed by
Africans, of whom Ghana was the most
vocal, and in the main represented the
poorer countries to whom colonial op-
pression was only yesterday and develop-
ment a hope of tomorrow.
Thirdly, there were the countries who
believe it is necessary to oppose the new
imperialism of confrontation and Com-
munist aggression Malaysia, India
(whose representative, Finance Minister
Krishnamachari, warned of the dangers
to the non-Communist cause in the pos-
sible loss of Laos), Australia, New Zea-
land and, to a lesser extent, Canada.
Significantly, these countries, with the
exception of Canada, are located either
in or adjacent to South-East Asia, where
Communist China is the unmistakable
colossus of the future.
To the superficial eye there seemed re-
markably little common ground between
section one and section two. Malaysia’s
plight indicated this. The Malaysian
Prime Minister, Tunku Abdul Rahman,
and Sir Robert Menzies tried to evoke
African sympathy for Malaysia’s diffi.
culties. The Tunku insisted that Indo-
nesia’s confrontation could end Malay-
sian independence. Malaysia was ex-
periencing a jungle war launched against
a people numbering only 10,000,000 by
a neighbor State ten times as large.
Menzies said that Malaysia had been
set up under constitutional and demo-
cratic procedures. The newly indepen-
dent Commonwealth countries all had
.something at stake in Malaysia’s future.
A newly independent State should not
be left to fight for its new-found inde-
pendence against a threat just because
the threat was from a new quarter. He
asked that Malaysia’s fight be fought by
Commonwealth action, not only in the
jungle where actual fighting was taking
place, but diplomatically at UNO and
in all the councils of the world.
There were very few signs that either
the Tunku's or Menzies’ words produced
a reaction of any consequence among the
Africans. Their preoccupation was with
the old imperialism, not the new one.
It is known that Menzies had reserva-
tions about the political sagacity of Sir
Alec Douglas-Home in balling such a
club meeting at this particular moment
of time. Sir Alec may be able to squeeze
out of the conference a face-saving final
communique that may conceivably be of
some value in his election struggle. But
from the outset it has been obvious that
the division of interests between the
diverse club members goes deep.
THE COMMUNISTS
The Defence Plants Strikes
Echoes of the Sino-Soviet split
FROM A SYDNEY CORRESPONDENT
Communists failed to stop work in
A all defence establishments in NSW
and Victoria on July 7 as was their
clear aim, but one disturbing conclusion
emerges. Their partial success should
alert the Commonwealth Government,
the trade union movement and the pub-
lic to the dangerous penetration of Com-
munists into our defence industries at a
time of international tension, especially
to the north of Australia.
The trouble started to brew last month
when the Communists proposed a four-
hour strike in Australian defence estab-
lishments, ostensibly in protest against
Public Service Board delay in meeting
ACTU-sponsored claims for increased
wages and other benefits in the Com-


monwealth Public Service and Common-
wealth instrumentalities.
The strike was called off after the
ACTU secretary (Mr H. J. Souter), in
8 strongly-worded directive to the 33
unions involved in negotiations, branded
the proposed stoppage as a defiance of
union policy. Mr Souter reminded the
unions that they had rejected proposals
for industrial stoppages in favor of
pressing the claims by negotiation.
Meanwhile, the Public Service Board
replied to some of the claims, but the
scheming continued and plans were laid
for the July 7 stoppage. Late last month
the ACTU president (Mr A. E. Monk)
condemned the proposal, and five
moderate unions told their members to
stay at work. The Ironworkers’ Laurie
Short wrote personally to his 500 mem-
bers at Garden Island naval dockyard
in Sydney telling them not to be hood-
winked. On the eve of the stoppage
Short sent urgent telegrams to six shop
stewards at Garden Island directing
them not to stop and to inform iron-
workers of this direction.
Federal Conciliation Commissioner
T. C. Winter, a former Federal secretary
of the Municipal Employees’ Union and
one-time member of the ACTU inter-
state executive, backed these union
moves by directing the nine metal unions
with members in defence establishments
not to stop.
Dut strike they did —or most of them,
U unwillingly for the most part. At
day’s end the strike scoreboard in NSW
read: Garden Island, 1500 out, 500 in;
Neutral Bay torpedo factory, all in;
Spectacle Island naval plant, all in;
St Mary’s munition filling factory, all in;
Lithgow small arms factory, 900 in, 100
(all Amalgamated Engineering Union)
out; Lucas Heights, about 20 in, 100 out.
In Victoria, 4000 workers in 12 estab-
lishments took the afternoon off.
Commonwealth defence establish-
ments, especially naval dockyards, have
either a poor screening system or none
at all, because Communists with long
records of industrial sabotage have
worked there for years.
Shop stewards’ jobs being what they
are—often thankless, sometimes un-
wanted—it is not long before Commu-
nists, always ready to seize any oppor-
tunity, have themselves elected to these
key positions at job level. Once there
they make little pretence of working.
Meanwhile, Communists have been
either denying that they are involved or
are laying the blame for the trouble on
the shop stewards. But the fact is that
the spearhead is the Communist-
influenced Amalgamated Engineering
Union—working in conjunction with
Communist shop stewards.
Significantly, more members of the
AEU participated in the July 7 stop-
pages than members of other unions.
This was not accidental, because the
strike had been planned for weeks at
secret meetings in AEU premises in Syd-
ney and Melbourne.
Communist activity must be viewed,
also, in the light of the current war be-
tween Mr Sharkey’s Moscow-tied Com-
munist Party of Australia and Mr Hill’s
Peking variety. The Moscow boys, fol-
lowing Khrushchev’s line, would like to
operate behind the united front camou-
flage, hoping thus to assume leadership
of many unions and even sections of the
Australian Labor Party. But they are
haunted by the inroads on their members
and supporters by the Hill group, whose
hard line strikes a responsive chord in
many old Stalinists in the party.
UNIVERSITIES
Mercy for Benn
Out next year?
FROM A PERTH CORRESPONDENT
MAURICE BENN
“No animal”
fThiE University of Western Australia
-*■ has shown by words and deeds
where it stands in the matter of mercy
killer Dr Maurice Benn, former head
of its German language department. It
has announced that it will re-employ him
as soon as he is released.
Scottish-born Benn (49) is serving a
sentence of 10 years’ hard labor in
Fremantle gaol for the murder of his
mentally afflicted 4i-year-old son. One
night last February Dr Benn brooded at
home over his two great fears —that his
increasingly uncontrollable little boy
might have to be taken away soon to
spend a lifetime in mental institutions,
and that his wife might suffer a nervous
breakdown because of the boy. Benn
reached a decision that at the time
seemed to him the only solution. He
wrote a letter and left it in his study for
his wife to see later. Then, aware of the
consequences, he got a rifle and shot the
sleeping boy.
In the Criminal Court Dr Benn was
frank about his actions and motives.
The Crown Prosecutor told the jury
that nobody had the right to take life,
even if the child was a raving lunatic.
Dr Benn's counsel said that WA law on
murder applied to a killing that was not
“justified or excused by law”.
The judge advised the jury not to be
swayed by sympathy, and its quick ver-
dict of guilty of wilful murder, with no
recommendation for mercy, was followed
by the judge’s mandatory sentence that
Benn be hanged.
After the trial Maurice Benn’s wife
Irene (35) refused an offer to sell their
life story to the Sydney “Mirror” and
its Perth newspaper, the “Sunday
Times”. But for no payment she spoke
frankly to a representative of the Perth
“Daily News”: “Maurice is no criminal;
he did it because he loved both of us.”
The university lost little time in
writing to the Government to seek com-
mutation of the death sentence. The
Chancellor, Sir Alex Reid, said: “The
university has every sympathy for Dr
Benn and his wife. It will do everything
it can to help them.” Other Australian
universities, organisations and hundreds
of individuals throughout Australia and
in overseas countries joined in with
pleas of mercy and condemnation of the
savage sentence.
Then, if any public complacency re-
mained, it was destroyed by an account,
in the Perth newspaper, “Weekend
News”, of the appalling confusion
among the jury members who had con-
victed Benn; one of them had announced
that he made up his mind two days
before the case was over, others believed
they were not allowed to bring any
verdict other than guilty of wilful
murder or murder.
Several days later, the State Cabinet
dealt with the Benn case and reduced
the sentence to 10 years’ imprisonment
with hard labor. The university helped
Mrs Benn by giving her a job as a
tutor in German. Educated in Germany,
she was well qualified.
Meanwhile Dr Benn has accepted pri-
son life and decided to make the best of
what he had. He is able to study about
three hours daily and about seven hours
on Sundays, and does clerical work in
the store.
Now the question is: When will he
be released? At most, he could expect
to serve only li of his 10 years, be-
cause of remissions for good conduct.
But Mrs Benn hopes to see him out next
year.


OIL—I
R. W. Miller and the
Seamen’s Union
A honeymoon turns sour?
FROM A BRISBANE CORRESPONDENT
R. W. MILLER
More tankers, more jobs?
A number of interesting points are
emerging from Mr R. W. Miller’s
recent efforts to increase his tanker fleet
from one to three. Primarily it means
that all Australian tankers will eventu-
ally have Australian crews, and it is an
economic fact of life that this will result
in increased petrol and oil prices.
As Miller’s tankers increase so his
uneasy honeymoon with Seamen’s
Union secretary E. V. Elliott becomes
less and less a thing of joy. In the first
place this strange alliance was good tac-
tics on the part of each. If Miller suc-
ceeded in getting his tankers, there would
be more jobs for Australian seamen. On
the other hand, the industrial support
that Elliott mustered through the ACTU
and the Communist Party was no small
factor in Miller’s ultimate triumph.
But Miller is in the game for profit—
and seamen want more jobs and higher
wages. This is the rock on which the
Miller-Elliott axis must founder. Before
his second tanker had even arrived in
Australia the Seamen’s Union had begun
to put pressure on Miller to increase the
crew of the first tanker, Miller’s Cano-
pus, by an additional three ABs. In
terms of cash this item meant well over
£6OOO a year. Miller fought this pro-
posal strenuously. A compromise was
finally reached, and one extra AB was
engaged.
Behind this high-level dispute between
Miller and Elliott was a little-known
difference between Elliott and the sea-
men. In a report on the first dispute in
the seamen’s journal it was stated that
“the emphasis by the Miller’s Canopus
crew was that the greatest need was for
the union to negotiate a tanker bonus”.
In other words, the seamen wanted more
money, and increased manning ran a
bad second. Either way was of little
comfort to Miller. He would have to
pay.
Seamen also grumbled because Miller
had been allowed to bring his new tanker
to Australia with a foreign crew. They
maintained that Elliott should have stuck
to the union principle of insisting that an
Australian crew be flown to the port of
delivery to bring the tanker home.
In any case the lesson (for Miller)
will be well learned, and the future
Australian-built tankers will doubtless be
so constructed as to need fewer crew
members than the second-hand ships
purchased overseas. Already crew re-
quirements on 20,000 tonners can be
cut by 25 per cent by the use of self-
tensioning winches.
Elliott, too, is caught in a cleft stick.
For he must prove to the court and the
shipowners that he can supply crew
members (whom he claims have left the
industry for better-paid jobs ashore) for
these tankers when they are constructed,

80 Years Ago: July 19, 1884
*TPhe amazing proposal made by the
Rev. Mr Willis to the effect that
in the text of the prayers for rain,
authorised for use in Anglican
Churches, provision shall be made
for mention of the particular locality
for which rain is supplicated, and
the almost equally amazing adoption
of the proposal by the Bishop of
Sydney, appear to have been con-
sidered topics too sacred for com-
ment by our contemporaries. It is
true that the Bishop, while assenting,
reduced the flagrant quality of the
proposed blasphemy by suggesting a
generalisation of the terms of
supplication. But this amendment
was nearly as bad as the absurdity
it seemed designed to tone down.
The Rev. Mr Willis’ suggestion was
apparently based upon the idea that
the ALMIGHTY is so deficient in
sense and discretion, that, if appealed
to by a duly authorised petitioner to
send rain, He would be apt to provide
it where it wasn’t wanted. If Mr
Willis’ idea had been carried out
with strict attention to exactitude, it
would have become requisite to
frame prayers for rain so that they
would read like schedules in a land-
bill, or pages of a deed of title to
real estate; and the Divinity would be
instructed, to prevent mistakes, that
the wished-for moisture was re-

OIL-II
Internationals
Strike Again
But inhere are the
Australians?
FROM J. C. FLORSFALL IN MELBOURNE
Australian oil search effort, or at
A least its international oil company
component, was given a timely shot in
the arm last week when that paragon
of patience, Wapet, and the successful
Moonie group, Union-Kern-AOG, en-
countered strong oil flows at wells 2400
miles (as the crow flies) apart at Barrow
Island, off the north-west coast of WA,
and Alton, 55 miles west-south-west of
the successful Moonie field in Southern
Queensland.
Not so many months ago oil search
leaders were bemoaning the rundown
in drilling activity, idle rigs and con-
sequent “unhealthy” price cutting in the
contracting industry, and the failure of
geological and geophysical exploration
to get safely ahead of the drill. Worse
still, the first discovery at Moonie in
1961 was beginning to look pretty
distant; and in the interim oil finds in
only two other areas, Sunnybank and
Richmond, both in Queensland, had
given clues, but hardly strong ones, to
possible further commercial develop-
ment.
Indeed, the oil scene looked dismal,
and searchers were beginning to turn
their thoughts more towards natural gas
as wells in a number of widely-scattered
places Yardarino (WA), Gidgealpa
(SA), Menindee (NT) and Central
Queensland —gushed it forth in tantalis-
ing streams. But this was only a poor
second best to the main quarry, oil
itself.
The new wildcat strikes change all
that, at least so far as the overseas oil
companies who dominate the groups
which made them are concerned un-
fortunately, the Australian public’s
interest in them is very small. Ampol

of Ampol Exploration’s own capital, 70
per cent is owned by Ampol Petroleum
Ltd and only 30 per cent by the public.
Moreover, although AOG is a public
company and all its shares are listed on
’Change, its share of the Union-Kern-
AOG group’s net profits is only 20 per
cent (however, it doesn’t have to con-
tribute to the group’s operating ex-
penses). In these circumstances one
couldn’t expect the new discoveries to
set oil shares alight on Australian Stock
Exchanges and, apart from a flare up in
AOG, which seemed to be undervalued
before the strike at Alton anyway, price
movements were small (even general)
through the oil search list.
Of course, if the follow-up informa-
tion from Barrow Island and Alton is
favorable, this slow reaction could well
accelerate and re-energise interest in
providing much needed capital for Aus-
tralian - owned oil search companies,
which, apart from the Associated group,
have yet to put a score on the oil board.
But gone are the days when even well
substantiated and big strikes, such as
these two are, appear to whet the in-
vesting appetite of the man in the
street.
BUSINESS
A Rebuff for
Mr Rylah
And a trick for Mr Testro
FROM A MELBOURNE CORRESPONDENT
Mr A. RYLAH
...judicial advice
Mr Rex Testro was sharply rebuked
by Mr Justice Sholl in the Vic-
torian Supreme Court last week for
being “at least over-sanguine, if not
reckless, in the purchase of Garrisson
Industries”, one of the reasons for the
parlous condition his main company,
Testro Bros Consolidated, fell into a
couple of years ago.
But at least Testro had the satisfaction
of the court saving this company from
extinction, thus winning his drawn-out
battle with the official inspector, Sir
James Tait, QC, and Mr Rylah, who
put him in. Mr Justice Sholl dismissed
the Attorney-General’s petition to wind
up the company and gave Mr Rylah a
little judicial advice for good measure.
This was all the more galling for
Mr Rylah because in the judge’s view
there is a good deal of evidence to sup-
port the claim that the really critical
event which made the company’s failure
inevitable was not the purchase of Gar-
risson Industries in 1962 but the Govern-
ment's appointment of an inspector to
investigate the affairs of the company
in January, 1963. It will be recalled
that Mr Testro protested strongly at the
latter, especially as he was refused legal
representation at the investigation.
“There is no doubt that the immediate
effect of the appointment of the inspec-
tor was quite disastrous,” said the judge.
The Crown’s case, that liquidation
Would be in the public interest, appar-
ently didn’t impress Mr Justice Sholl as
much as the argument that the wishes of
creditors and shareholders, which were
unanimously against it, should prevail.
Given that view, liquidation was obvi-
ously very nearly lost. It collapsed com-
pletely when the court came to the
conclusion that the company could stay
on its feet. Mr Justice Sholl believed
that, thanks to a possible £2 million pro-
fit he thought could be made on the
company’s big real estate development
in Queensland, it would eventually be
able to pay off all creditors and even
leave something over for shareholders
(nearly all the shares are held by Rex
Testro and his brother, Mr K. R. Testro,
who started the business with their war
gratuities in a backroom in Fitzroy).
As to the purchase of Garrisson In-
dustries, the court found that a pros-
pectus statement issued by Rex Testro
claiming it to be a “growth” of assets
was not false, as the Crown had claimed.
Mr Justice Sholl said he could find no-
thing to show that Mr Testro knew the
assets to be worthless and “that what
I have heard makes me think it is at
least probable that Mr Peter Garrisson
and perhaps someone associated with
him may have been much more worthy
of censure than the directors of Testro
Bros Consolidated Ltd.”
If the Garrisson companies have not
yet been the subject of an Attorney-
General’s investigation, “the evidence
very strongly suggests they ought to be,”
said the judgment. However, Mr Justice
Sholl went on to say that it might not be
desirable to do this until the pending
fraud action by Testro Bros against Mr
Peter Garrisson and Garrisson Holdings
had been decided. The action had been
held over until after the Victorian State
elections, in which Mr Peter Garrisson
was an unsuccessful candidate for re-
election to the Assembly. So as well
as having his petition dismissed, Mr
Rylah got some gratuitous advice from
the judge as well. After Mr Justice
Raptke and all, it was a poor start to
Mr Rylah’s new term as Attorney-
General.

Emerson and
the
LTAA
Banning the
rebels
From “Discus” in Sydney
In a world short of good laughs there
will be a universal one this week if
Canada’s Davis Cup team happens to
beat Australia’s in Montreal, after all the
high drama of the past few days. It
would be a healthy upset. The LTAA
would lose the £40,000 (an American
estimate) it might expect from the chal-
lenge round gate and TV receipts—a
sobering price to pay for the right to
control players as if they were children.
They are not. They are businessmen,
working at a business called, for some
strange reason, amateur tennis.
As I remarked two months ago, the
players who are good enough to hold
or challenge for the Davis Cup contri-
bute large sums of money to tennis in
Australia. They also play in the National
and State championships. When that’s
done, they want to be off to foreign
parts. The LTAA wants to keep them
at home for minor tournaments and
exhibitions.
This year the LTAA fixed March 31
as the deadline. The top players left
in February; and became “rebels”. The
LTAA had no rule to cover their de-
fiance but it had the right to say who
could play in its Davis Cup team. So
it banned the rebels, and cut a big hole
in its own pocket.
After he had won at Wimbledon, and
our Davis Cup selectees, Newcombe and
Roche, had failed badly, Emerson offer-
ed his services—with a promise to remain
in Australia until the third or fourth
week in February. The LTAA’s “men
of principle” then indicated they were
willing to lose face by one month, but
not by five weeks, no sir! Roy must
promise February 28, and get on over
to Montreal, or else.
To most minds Emerson has emerged
from the fracas as a person more con-
cerned with Australia’s reputation than
the sport’s administrators, whom he fed
a bitter pill in his letter: “I think I realise
even more than you do how serious this
Position is hurting Australia as well as
Australian tennis.”


OUT AND ABOUT
The Unfinished Symphony
Or how we learnt to stop worrying and love the opera house
By PATRICIA ROLFE
Tvvo years ago this month The
Bulletin published a progress
report on the Sydney Opera House
with a cover by Mr Jim Phillips. This
week's cover, also by the fine hand of
Mr Phillips, shows the opera house look-
ing to the casual eye not greatly differ-
ent. However, there have been some
changes. In that time the cost has gone
from £12,500,000 to £17,400,000 and
the date of completion from “early
1965” to March, 1967.
In this time, too, the leading role
which Mr Heffron, as Premier, inherited
from Mr Cahill has now fallen to a
somewhat reluctant Mr Renshaw. The
Leader of the Opposition, Mr Askin,
has made strenuous efforts to enlarge
his own part as the conscience of the
king, meanwhile casting the Building
Workers’ Industrial Union in the role
of villains. The union, in its turn,
has denounced the contractors for
Stage 2, M. R. Hornibrook. Although
Mr Renshaw has the leading role his
has become virtually a non-speaking
part, the Minister for Works, Mr Ryan,
acting as the bearer of evil tidings. The
president of the executive committee,
Mr S. Haviland, who at one time re-
lentlessly occupied the centre of the
stage, has now retired to the wings,
perhaps until the action is a little less
crowded. The architect, Mr Joern
Utzon, continues in his role of prima
donna.
As well, there are noises off from a
number of architects, journalists, writers
of letters to the editor and just general
overall experts, each with his own par-
ticular theory on what went wrong and
what is likely to go right. All in all,
the opera house is providing the people
of Sydney with a fascinating plot and an
all-star cast. But the price of admission
is high.
At this stage the general feeling (the
sort of general feeling that is gauged
by talking to a few friends, a couple of
people in the office and one or two
Sydney taxi-drivers) is that we are now
committed to the project, the money is
forthcoming from lotteries and that it
is better to go ahead at any price than
stop. From this point on the question is
what are we going to put in it when it
is finished.
What the people of New South Wales
have now accepted is that it was a con-
sidered decision of Mr Cahill as Premier
to proceed with the opera house without
waiting for detailed plans. This deci-
sion took account of the vagaries of
Government finance and the shifting
priorities of politicians. It was not
“political ’ in the sense that Mr Cahill
hoped to gain popularity from it;
apparently, in a dedicated but devious
way, he hoped only to gain an opera
house. If Mr Cahill had waited we
would now have had complete plans
but no opera house,” said a senior
engineer on the project, and that might
be engraved on a dedication plaque
when the building is finished.
But it seems unlikely that the people
of New South Wales will ever have any
exact idea of why costs rose from
£3,500,000 to at least £17,400,000. The
Premier, Mr Renshaw, has refused a
Royal Commission, but will meet Mr
Utzon and Mr Ryan this week,
The story on costs is pretty much like
the woman who suddenly finds she's put
on a stone; it's gone on all over and
she can't blame the eclairs for afternoon
tea any more than the buttered toast for
breakfast. A spokesman for Horni-
brook’s was inclined to allot priority for
factors causing delays and increased
costs, to the present moment, as follows:
# Industrial. Strikes have been a
characteristic of Stage 2 in a way they
were not f or stage 1 the preliminary
structure work carried out by Civil and
Civic under a lump-sum contract. Civil
and Civic paid above-award wages. This
is part of the company’s general policy
and is related to productivity, and has
been adopted after consultation with
trade unions.
However, a condition of Hornibrook’s
contract with the Government was that
they should not pay above-award rates,
On-again, off-again strikes have made
Hornibrook’s somewhat philosophic,
They feel these are part of a pattern to
force the NSW Government to agree
to higher wages on the opera house site,
and that they, Hornibrook’s, are merely
the ham in the sandwich,
« Weather. Sydney’s" 1963 rainfall
wou i d not have been bargained for,
although it would have been known
that costs on a building without a roof
and built substantially of concrete could
soar.


• Additional complications to the
work. The breathtaking site proved more
expensive than was hoped. Faults
necessitated 500 piles and concrete
foundations go 70 feet below water
level. In some places faults had merely
been filled in with rubble, perhaps by
convicts, and extensive work had to be
done before the site could support a
building the size of the opera house. The
cost of excavation went from £1,147,000
to £2,580,000. Delays in Stages 1 and 2
have meant that items which come under
Stage 3, which comprises stage machi-
nery, electrical equipment, furniture and
fittings, are now more expensive, the
estimate of £500,000 for stage machinery
now being three times that sum.
What remains most baffling about the
Sydney Opera House is not what it is
costing but where responsibility lies.
Cabinet could, of course, order work to
cease, but short of that it is hard to see
how effective curbs can be applied.
Neither the contractors, nor the Public
Works Department spokesman, nor the
Executive Committee seems to be able
to give one simple, concrete example of
how a small or large saving could be
made. Everything is a matter of deli-
cate negotiation with Mr Utzon.
The Public Works Department has,
since the 1960 Opera House Act, been
the statutory construction authority. The
Department on the opera house site has
far fewer powers than it would on a
normal job, but the Minister, Mr Ryan,
has lately volunteered, or been pressed
into making, statements on overall cost,
which might have come from the Pre-
mier.
Arrangement of convenience
The Local Government Department still
A looks after the day-to-day accounts
for the opera house, but has no control
over expenditure. This arrangement is
one of convenience, because Mr Havi-
land, when appointed as president of the
executive committee in 1954, was under-
secretary of the Local Government De-
partment. He is now chairman of the
Sydney Water Board and, one would
think, in a fairly delicate position. He
is president of a committee building an
opera house for £17,400,000 and of a
board which is putting up a multi-storey
building in Sydney when much of the
city is still unsewered. Mr Haviland has
a reputation for accessibility, probably
based on the fact that he answers his
own telephone.
The Opera House Executive Commit-
tee meets monthly for a morning, or
Part of a morning. In spite of its name,
the committee, since the Public Works
department became the building author-
[ty, has acted mostly as an adviser. It
bows what is happening about costs,
bt can’t do much about it.
The executive committee exists and
meets concurrently with the Opera
House Trust, which was set up in 1961.
Membership is in common except that
the Premier and the Lord Mayor of
Sydney are ex-officio members of the
trust but are not members of the execu-
tive committee. The Lord Mayor at-
tends meetings but can speak only on
trust matters. The question of the
Premier's position at meetings hardly
arises, as other duties make appearances
rare occasions.
The committee comprises Mr Havi-
land; the Dean of the Faculty of Archi-
tecture at Sydney University, Professor
H. I. Ashworth; Dr Cobden Parkes,
former Government architect; Sir
Charles Moses, the retiring general
manager of the Australian Broadcasting
Commission; the Director-General of
Education, Dr H. S. Wyndham; the
principal of the Conservatorium of
Music, Sir Bernard Heinze; Dr Lloyd
Ross of the Australian Railways’ Union;
Mr B. Freeman, of Metro-Goldwyn-
Mayer; Mr Stefan Haag of the Eliza-
bethan Theatre Trust; Mr Neil Hutchi-
son, of the Australian Broadcasting Com-
mission; Miss Doris Fitton, of the Inde-
pendent Theatre; Mr H. E. W. Arthy,
who retired as managing director of Ber-
lei, corset manufacturers, last year; Mr
E. W. Adams, a former Town Clerk of
Sydney; Mr Eric Langker, of the Art
Gallery of NSW; and Mr J. D. Kenny,
MLC.
As can be seen, some have already
grown grey in the service and are no
longer in the position they held when
appointed. Under the Act of 1961 the
members of the executive committee re-
main as trustees until two years after the
opera house is finished. There is an
age limit of 70 for trustees. A certain
number of trustees will retire each year
but are eligible for reappointment, with
the proviso that one of the three trustees
newly appointed or reappointed each
year shall “be knowledgeable and ex-
perienced in the theatre”. The Act says
theatre and not music so it will be inter-
esting to see whether working for the
ABC will be regarded as near enough.
The fact that members of the trust
are now appointed ex officio has already
led to some disparity. Mr Hutchison
was appointed when he was on loan
from the ABC to the Elizabethan. In
1962 he went back to the ABC, leaving
the Elizabethan with no representation
until Dr Nicolai Malko’s death created
a vacancy, filled eventually by Mr Haag.
Mr Haag is at present the only member
of the trust working in the theatre (it is
hard to see much relationship between
Miss Fitton’s theatre at North Sydney
and an opera house).
Waiting for Stage 3
executive committee has three sub-
A committees. One is the technical
advisory panel, another the traffic sub-
committee, which, incidentally, has
existed since 1958, making it difficult to
believe that it was “The Sun” newspaper
which first considered the question of
parking for the opera house. The third
is music and drama. This comprises Sir
Bernard Heinze, Sir Charles Moses, Mr
Hutchison, Mr Freeman, Miss Fitton
and Mr Haag, as well as Mr Harald
Bowden from J. C. Williamson’s, Miss
Dorothy Helmrich, of the Arts Council,
Mr Justice Macfarlane, representing
Musica Viva, Mr William Orr, of the
Phillip Theatre, Professor Donald Peart,
of the Music Department, Sydney Uni-
versity, Mr Joseph Post, of the ABC,
Mr Robert Quentin, of the National
Institute of Dramatic Art and Mr John
Sumner, of the Union Repertory Theatre,
Melbourne.
The trust now has its first permanent
employee, the first of what may even-
tually be a staff of about 300. He is
Mr Kevin Turnbull, who took over a
few months ago from Mr R. Thomson,
now deputy director of the new State
Planning Authority. Mr Turnbull had
six weeks as assistant to Mr Thomson
and then was handed the opera house
files to do some homework. Mr Turn-
bull has been sharing an office with
about 20 other people in the Local
Government Department. Mr Turnbull’s
duties specifically include public relations
although he is not a professional public
relations officer. Most queries are re-
ferred to him although, as a public ser-
vant, he is not able to make official state-
ments or, in fact, to be anything except
amiable and intelligent, both of which
he, fortunately, is.
The trust will come back into the pic-
ture when Stage 3is announced. It was
expected that Stage 3 would be an-
nounced at the same time as an estimate
of cost was given. This, however, did
not happen. But when Stage 3 is an-
nounced, Mr Haviland has said in the
past, steps will be taken to advertise for
a manager and to make arrangements
for the opening night and subsequent
season.

HOW TO AVOID MISTRAKES ds? ERRERS
Well, the obvious way is to use a calculator.
But isn’t it true that you can make mistakes as you feed
information into a calculator?
Not with a Facit. It’s almost impossible to make a mistake
because you see each number displayed immediately, as you
enter it. And both the first number and the multiplying
number are permanently on display for checking during the
calculation.
This virtually mistake-proof characteristic is the main reason
Facit Calculators are used in all Australian banks and
universities.
You can learn to operate a Facit in 14 minutes. You can
have a free trial for 14 days. And in 1966, the Facit Calculator
will also become an excellent adding machine—without
decimal conversion.
There are six high-speed models to choose from, and a
demonstration is always available at the sole Australian agents:

There is no doubt that J. C. William-
son's opera season with Joan Sutherland
next year has somewhat taken the wind
out of the sails of the opera house. The
Sutherland-Williamson company will, it
is expected, be everything that the open-
ing season of the opera house should be.
The Sutherland-Williamson company
could be substantially Australian, al-
though Williamson’s say, as they always
do, that they will “import” the finest
overseas singers for the season. (Some
of these may be Australians who slip in
under Williamson's screen.)
Monster concert
tPHE opening of the Sydney Opera
-*■ House, if the building is not to con-
tinue as something of a joke, will have to
match or better this standard of pro-
duction. If the date of completion is
March, 1967, it seems unlikely that Miss
Sutherland, our most distinguished
singer, could return to this country so
soon after a major tour. However,
thinking on the opening ceremony, if
there is much thinking, still seems to be
along the lines of a monster concert.
And a monster concert it may very well
be. Could Miss Sutherland, having
made one spectacular return to her
homeland, be expected to plumb the
depths of loyalty required to come back
for a monster concert?
However, there are reassurances about
the Opening Ceremony, as it is called
with reverent caps, in the Opera House
Trust’s report to June 30, 1963. The
trust agrees that a minimum of two
years would be needed to make arrange-
ments for the Opening Ceremony and
subsequent operations of the opera
house. The trust is quite certain (as
well it might be at the present rate of
building) that this period will be avail-
able.
“Much has been said,” the report
says, “in the Press about principal
artists having commitments several years
ahead and the danger that such artists
will not be available for the opening of
the Sydney Opera House unless immedi-
ate action is taken to book them.
“Such statements, although undoubt-
edly made in good faith, ignore the fact
that the trust has within its own ranks
and in the ranks of its expert advisers,
local and overseas, a source of expert
knowledge and experience in these mat-
ters and while it is premature to indulge
in any detailed prognostications at this
stage, the trust considers that it is rea-
sonable to expect that reliance be placed
in its capacity to do what has to be done,
in time and in good fashion.”
So far, reliance placed in the capacity
of those entrusted with building the
opera house —and that includes the exe-
cutive committee —to do what has to be
done, in time and in good fashion,
appears more than a little misplaced.
The question of a manager is not a
large one. He will merely be a superior
sort of letting clerk and the job will not
have the crucial importance it would
have if the opera house were to be run
as a European one with full opera and
ballet companies under its roof.
Whatever happens on the opening
night the Elizabethan Theatre Trust
seems full of confidence in its ability to
make generous use of the Sydney Opera
House. The director of the Elizabe-
than, Mr Stefan Haag, says that much
of the Elizabethan’s activities are now
directed, if somewhat obliquely, towards
the day when the opera house is finished.
The Elizabethan regards the Sydney
Opera House as the third State theatre,
with, of course, the Theatre Royal,
Hobart, having the distinction of being
the first and Canberra following next
year. Melbourne’s Cultural Centre
theatre is not likely to come* into the
Elizabethan’s plans until around 1970.
The Elizabethan confirms that the
Opera House Trust has already inform-
ally told the Australian Broadcasting
Commission that it may have the Major
Hall for approximately 100 nights a
year, or averaging four concerts a week,
for six months, for the Sydney Sym-
phony Orchestra, visiting orchestras and
some solo artists.
Mr Haag expects that most Elizabe-
than opera and ballet will be confined to
the Minor Hall, seating 1200. Opera
and ballet will occupy the Major Hall,
the seating of which does fluctuate be-
tween 2900 and 1800, for special large
productions, such as, perhaps, a Suther-
land season. However, the Minor Hall,
as Mr Roger Coveil, of the “Sydney
Morning Herald”, has pointed out, has
provision for an orchestra of only about
40. Mr Haag conceded this point and
admits that this is, in his view, “the
only real flaw in the whole opera house”.
The orchestra pit can be enlarged at the
sacrifice of audience seating.
However, on present expectations the
Elizabethan feels it will be able to make
use of the Minor Hall for anything up to
six months of the year for opera and
ballet. Mr Haag admitted that the
ABC’s use of the Major Hall for six
months and the infrequency of the
Major Hall’s use for opera and ballet
would mean that vastly expensive stage
machinery would get very little use.
“But,” he said, “we are building the
opera house for the next 100 years, not
for the next ten years. Who knows, in
10 years’ time we may have to build a
concert hall elsewhere and use the Major
Hall for opera and ballet for most of the
year?”
Mr Haag is equally confident that the
Elizabethan will be able to make use
of the Experimental Theatre, which
seats 430, for dramatic presentations for
most of the year. According to the
Opera House Trust, the prime purpose
of the Experimental Theatre is to stage
“amateur theatricals”. However, “ama-
teur theatricals” will go into the Sydney
Opera House over Mr Haag’s dead body.
The Elizabethan hopes by 1967 to have
found a suitable theatre on the North
Shore (if they could find one they would

open it tomorrow) to add to the Old
Tote at Kensington, making with the
Experimental Theatre a theatrical tri-
angle. The Elizabethan would then be
able to support a nucleus of about 30
players, on contract (to actors in 1964,
this must sound like the millennium),
who might play at any one of these
theatres and some of whom might also
visit other States.
This is all on the assumption that the
Elizabethan is permitted a big stake in
the opera house. Williamson’s have said
they envisage the possibility of staging
opera there. Other commercial manage-
ments may be like-minded.
One of the facts about the opera
house which came to light during the
cost controversy was that it is still cost-
ing less than the launcher for the Blue
Streak Rocket. Whatever comparisons
can be made between the Blue Streak
and the opera house, the opera house’s
security arrangements are entirely
superior.
The Opera House Trust employs no
public relations officer. This does not
mean that the trust is unaware of the
need for publicity. It says in its re-
port to June 30, 1963: —
“Public interest in the opera house is
continuing to mount. At the present
time, most of the limelight is directed
upon the actual construction with its
many unique and complex features, but,
as the building proceeds, more and more
attention will focus upon the functional
aspects.
“It is known that the construction
authority proposes to develop publicity
media in respect of the opera house such
as by production of models, brochures
and films and this will undoubtedly do
much to inform the public mind. How-
ever, the developing interest in the pro-
ject will create a need for authoritative
publicity covering the subject more
comprehensively than is possible from
a merely construction point of view.
The trust proposes accordingly to pro-
duce appropriate publicity.”
Nobody could get much out of that
verbiage, but, apparently, the trust is
proposing to counter the endless bad
publicity the opera house has had, and
still gets, with a brochure, the sort of
thing, presumably, that lands on your
desk each morning and never gets out of
the envelope.
The Public Works Department has
built a viewing-station above where the
recorded voice of Professor Ashworth
of the trust explains the main features
of the construction work. Professor Ash-
worth, so far, is the trust’s star per-
former. Sydney cartoonist Bruce Petty
says his favorite nightmare is Sydney
demolished by an atom bomb and out
of the ashes rising the voice of Professor
Ashworth talking about the opera house.
The immediate and damning com-
parison with the Opera House Trust
approach is the Snowy Mountains
scheme. This scheme has undergone
changes, criticisms and crises. However,
when it began, its head, Sir William
Hudson, decided that as it was public
money being spent the public should
know what was happening. The SMA
has always had a superb public relations
organisation and Sir William has rested
sure that whenever the progress of the
scheme was threatened the public would
be on his side.
The executive committee of the opera
house, however, decided that there was
no point in selling a product until it
knew that it had a product to sell. This
implies (and this information came from
someone near the trust) that it would
not be for some time yet that it would
be known for certain that Mr Utzon’s
design was feasible. This is certainly
the most surprising thing that came out
of some weeks of mostly fruitless fos-
sicking for facts. If there is even a
slender chance now that the opera house
roof may not work, the executive com-
mittee was brave indeed not to have tried
to secure for itself whatever bulwarks
it could against the overwhelming wave
of public anger and dismay.
A major breakthrough
YI/Bile one must accept as valid the
" viewpoint that you don’t sell a
product until you have one, it seems sur-
prising that the State Government, for
political reasons, and the Executive
Committee, which might be expected to
take the long and optimistic view, has
not had skilled public relations, both to
counter the poor existing impression and
to encourage the people of New South
Wales in a belief in their opera house.
If the executive committee is so careful
about spending a few thousand a year,
how did the cost of the opera house ever
get to £17,400,000?
The inescapable and dazzling thing
about the Sydney Opera House is that
to see it is to believe in it. What
now looks from Professor Ashworth’s
little platform, or from the harbor, like
the aftermath of a bomb from the inside
is inspiringly beautiful, even now. One
can understand the dedication of Joern
Utzon, to whom this has become a life’s
work. One can understand what the
consulting engineer Ove Arup means
when he says that the Sydney Opera
House will be a major breakthrough in
modern architecture. One can under-
stand how impatient and contemptuous
people close to the project get of criti-
cism. If only they didn't forget that
criticism is really the only sign of any
continuing interest. And if only those
near to it didn’t forget how remote they
have made it from the people of Sydney,
to whom it will one day belong.

Protest on
France’s
Bomb Tests
“A hostile act ”
From MAURICE SHADBOLT
In Auckland
Direct actionists are likely to drop
a political hot potato into Prime
Minister Keith Holyoake’s lap.
There appear to be at least two groups
of people planning to sail yachts into
France’s Pacific H-Bomb test zone. At
the head of one group is well-known
author and yachtsman Adrian Hayter,
whose two one-man voyages from Eng-
land to New Zealand (the first was the
subject of his best-seller “Sheila in the
Wind”) made him something of a
national hero. Hayter has recently been
appointed leader of the New Zealand
team in the Antarctic. Whether he will
forgo this appointment in order to sail
into the French test zone remains to be
seen.
The point is that these yachts will
have to sail from New Zealand territory
(in the Cook Islands) into the test area.
Asked if he would support such a pro-
test, in view of his own reiterated opposi-
tion to the French tests, Mr Holyoake
said the question was still hypothetical.
Since he has been under some pressure
to stiffen New Zealand’s protests on the
French tests —it has been suggested that
he might dispatch a ship or two of the
RNZN into the test zone—it is unlikely,
anyway, that he would block Hayter and
others. But how, in this event, would
France react? The chances are that
even a policy of non-interference with
the protesters would be regarded as a
hostile act by France. So far, Holyoake
has strongly resisted suggestions that
New Zealand break off trade with
France. The French may yet do this
for him.
So it looks as if demonstrators will be
right on the spot for the first time in the
20-year history of nuclear protest. Says
the Auckland chairman of CRAFT (the
Committee for Resolute Action against
French Tests), Mr Richard Northey:
“We plan to keep the boat there as long
as we can. If the boat and crew aren’t
forcibly removed they will be there when
the bombs are dropped.
“We hope our stand will force the
French Government to cancel its nuclear
tests. There will be serious consequences
if the French attempt to remove our
boat. If they do they will be interfering
with a New Zealand vessel in interna-
tional waters.”
The CRAFT craft will have the bless-
ing of the Mayor of Auckland, Mr
D. M. Robinson. More than 50 people
—including two Australians —have so
far volunteered for the job.
Apartheid and sport make a more
explosive mixture than ever in this part
of the Pacific. The argument about
exclusion of Maoris from the 1960 All
Black team for South Africa, which led
to demonstrations in many cities and the
odd fracas on football fields, has never
really simmered down. On the defen-
sive ever since, Rugby Union admini-
strators have thrown out pacifying hints
that Maoris may not be excluded from
the next team for South Africa —in
1967. But they continue to hedge when
challenged to call off the 1967 tour
rather than once again exclude Maoris
at the request of the South Africans.
One event in particular has sparked
off the new row. After prolonged nego-
tiation with their South African counter-
parts, New Zealand rugby men announc-
ed enthusiastically that two Maoris would
be invited to attend the international
rugby jamboree in South Africa this
year. It seemed—for a moment —quite
a coup, and a major breakthrough in
the apartheid curtain. Then it was
learned that the two Maoris were to be
strictly non-players. Moreover the two
selected, Ralph Love and Pat Walsh,
were in complexion almost as European
as their names. Interestingly enough,
Ralph Love, a rugby administrator him-
self, was the only prominent Maori in
New Zealand to approve of the All-
White All Blacks in 1960. The coup
began to seem very dubious. Soon it
had a very sour taste indeed.
On his arrival in South Africa with
the New Zealand party, Auckland rugby
man Tom Pearce declared: “This cuts
the ground from under political agita-
tors in New Zealand.” Presumably by
agitators he meant every leading church-
man in New Zealand, most trade union
leaders, and all Maori MPs.
Walsh and Love were, of course, given
honored guest treatment in South Africa;
at one stage they were even introduced
to rugby-loving members of the Ver-
woerd Cabinet. In a cabled report from
South Africa (they later denied its
accuracy) they praised apartheid, and said
they had been astonished to see black
people everywhere—“in the streets, in
shops, in lifts, and even looking after
white children”. On their return home
they continued to insist that South Afri-
can whites were greatly misunderstood,
and that apartheid was really for the
benefit of the colored people. One thing
was clear: the South Africans have never
done a better public relations job—in
this part of the world, at least.
Prominent Maoris were quick to pro-
test, saying that the views of Love and
Walsh should not be taken as those of
the Maori race. But by then the picture
had become thoroughly confused. And
it is still not at all clear whether Maoris
will be welcome as players on the 1967
tour. Questioned on his attitude, Prime
Minister Keith Holyoake announced:
“It is purely a rugby matter.”
That was the attitude of Labor Prime
Minister Walter Nash back in 1959 and
1960 too. It is fairly well known in
Wellington that, at the height of the con-
troversy, Nash prepared a statement cri-
tical of the Rugby Union and then lost
his nerve before he could deliver it. (It
was election year.) Shortly afterwards
this longtime critic of South Africa be-
gan denouncing student demonstrators
and others who wished the 1960 tour
called off; he even got around to apolo-
gising for apartheid. “If I were a South
African,” he said, “I would not know
what to think.”
There the affair rests. The chances
are that New Zealand will see wide-
spread protest and demonstration again
before 1967. Since 1966 is election
year, it is most unlikely that politicians
will come off the fence. More serious,
though, is the possibility that there will
be active sabotage, perhaps even vio-
lence, during the Springbok tour next
year. The first hint of this came a few
months ago, when direct actionists in
Wellington dug up some of the pitch on
which the South Africa-New Zealand
cricket Test was to be played. A student
was tried and acquitted in a Wellington
court; the damage in fact was negligible.
Commented a columnist in Auckland’s
“Sunday News”: “A pity they didn’t
make a better job of it.” The same
newspaper has recently denounced New
Zealand sportsmen who are “helping
South Africa whitewash its fascist poli-
cies” —among them, sadly enough,

CPS 34
Arthur Lydiard, numbei one athletic
coach in New Zealand, and trainer of
Olympic champions Murray Halberg and
Peter Snell; he also has recently been
an honored guest in South Africa.
“Auckland Star” columnist Noel Holmes
has suggested that since Lydiard is em-
ployed in a public relations capacity by
a firm with strong South African inter-
ests, he would do well to remain silent.
Few New Zealand writers volunteered
for their appearance in a collection of
short stories published in Moscow earlier
this year; most of them had never heard
of it, until a bulky book with Cyrillic
title arrived in their mail. The first
shock was in Moscow’s selection. Many
of New Zealand’s best writers were ex-
cluded—presumably they did not qualify
as “progressive contemporary writers . ..
honest humanist artists”. And many
complete unknowns were featured as
New 7 Zealand's leading writers. It turned
out that these unknowns—one of them
had six stories against Katherine Mans-
field’s three —were contributors to Com-
munist Party journals. People like my-
self who had fondly imagined that this
kind of misrepresentation of national
literatures had gone out with Stalin were
rudely surprised. This anthology, any.,
way, harks back to the time when
Howard Fast was proclaimed by Mos-
cow to be the great American novelist,
A typical comment: “While holding
to bourgeois liberal views, he criticises
the class prejudices of New Zealand
landlords and their militaristic strivings.”
Another, on novelist Janet Frame: “The
democratic sympathies of the writer are
evident, but the influence of modernism
lowers the accusatory force of her
works.”
On myself, I found the fascinatingly
cryptic note: “In recent years, Shadbolt
has not taken part in public life.”
The Russian editors did not seem at
all handicapped by the fact that in New
Zealand—unlike Australia —there is not
one Communist writer of note. No
Frank Hardy, no Judah Waten, not even
a near equivalent; no one that is not
totally unknown outside a small, self-
admiring Auckland Communist clique.
According to the editors, New Zealand’s
leading writer appears to be one Murray
Gittos, born in 1920: “Gittos,” we are
told, “writes only for organs of the
Communist Party in New Zealand.”
The introduction, when finally trans-
lated, proved to be a witches’ brew of
inaccuracies and downright lies about
New Zealand. We learn, for example,
that there is a strong move afoot to pen
the Maoris up in reservations, “specially
set aside and equipped with various
exotic attributes which can attract the
attention of tourists.” It would all be
very funny, if the book hadn’t been pub-
lished in an edition of 55,000 for circu-
lation throughout the Soviet Union.
Perhaps the only pleasant thing one
can report about this sad piece of cold-
war bookmaking is that, after protests
to the Soviet Embassy in Wellington, all
writers in the collection were paid for
their pirated stories —sums ranging from
£2O to £7O. The system of payment
was unclear, however; presumably
writers were paid according to the ideo-
logical weight of their work.
On another literary front: After clear-
ing Baldwin’s “Another Country” for
general circulation, the Indecent Publica-
tions Tribunal set up by Attorney-
General Ralph Hanan last year is now
to look at Nabokov’s “Lolita”—declared
indecent four years ago in a case that
went to the Supreme Court. Meantime,
such works as Jean Genet’s “Lady of
the Flowers” and John Rechy’s “City of
Night” are openly on sale in Auckland
bookshops.
The Baldwin verdict appears to imply
that there is no longer any objection to
a frank treatment of homosexuality.
“Lady Chatterley”, though, is still for
burning.

“A Pretty Realistic Person”
Mary Dixon makes up her own mind
By PATRICIA ROLFE
Mrs Dean Dixon, wife of the new
musical director of the Sydney
Symphony Orchestra, has a warm
humor which enables her to rise above
being dubbed “the lonesco of Scandi-
navia” on the strength of plays she has
written under her name, Mary Mandelin,
and a frank intelligence which skids to
a stop just this side of tactlessness. For
example, Mrs Dixon doesn’t care for
opera, which she considers outdated and
outmoded.
“Of course, a full-scale presentation
at the Vienna State Opera is a very
elegant occasion,” she said. “But I
don’t think opera can say anything today.
I’m afraid I’m a pretty realistic person.
I don’t like poetry either.”
Mrs Dixon’s tastes in music ran
through Bach, Mozart and Beethoven.
She has a great respect for her hus-
band’s interpretation of Brahms, but is
prepared to forgo most romantic music.
Above all, she does not feel that because
she is Finnish she should profess to a
great admiration for Sibelius. “I like
him somewhat,” she conceded.
On the difficulties or, rather, impossi-
bilities of her husband ever conducting
in the United States, Mrs Dixon is very
frank.
“I have never been to the United
States and I don’t think I shall ever go,”
she said. “Imagine us having to go in
through separate doors. And I am so
arrogant, I would be forever having
arguments with people. I realise there
are many well-intentioned people in
America, but the feeling is still very
strong. For example, I know that on
occasion my husband’s name has been
left off the programmes of European
summer festivals, when the programmes
are issued by American tourist agencies.
They will have, say, Monday, conductor,
Ansermet; Wednesday, von Karajan; and
Tuesday, when my husband is conduct-
ing, nobody. Just a blank.
“Of course, some of my husband’s
racist friends feel he has deserted the
cause, but what could he do? He could
not conduct in America. He could not
work there. And my husband is com-
pletely unacceptable because he does not
think of himself as a Negro every min-
ute of the day, any more than you
wake up each day and think of your-
self as an Australian. He is a musician
and he thinks of music. They are quite
happy with someone like James Baldwin,
because he remembers constantly that he
is a Negro. And he makes himself an
outsider in every possible way. That
fits him into an acceptable pattern. But
my husband is not an outsider.”
But in Sydney’s winter sunshine and
in what both the Dixons feel has been
a warm welcome here, Mrs Dixon’s
mind was not particularly on race prob-
lems in the United States.
She said she didn’t mind the “lonesco
of Scandinavia” tag, but had been a little
alarmed when one young reporter started
talking about her plays in the same
breath as Strindberg.
“The plays were mostly written to fill
my days while my husband is working,”
she said. “I don’t consider myself a
full-time, professional playwright. But I
had worked as a journalist for a long
time and I found it hard to give up writ-
ing altogether. So when a friend who
has a Swedish-speaking theatre in Fin-
land asked me to write a play I did so.
They are really spoken short stories.”
Mrs Dixon said that she has written
five one-act plays and two longer ones.
They have been performed in Sweden,
France, Belgium and Denmark as well
as Finland.

“They are slightly surrealistic, I sup-

rather than follow a logical plot. The
best known is probably ‘The Onions’,
with three characters who peel onions
amid tears on stage. My last one, ‘Small
Opus about Us’, was produced in Fin-
land last May. However, once I’ve seen
a play produced I’m satisfied. I don’t
expect to make a great name or a lot
of money from them. I know lonesco
well and he was extraordinarily lucky.
He struggled for years writing his plays
and working as a concierge to earn
enough to eat. Then, suddenly, his plays
were the right thing at the right time.

surd will last. We will probably go back

pretty realistic. Even pretty sentimental.

shown that you can treat any subject in

End of a Legend
Success produced imitators
By C. J. BAXTER
A name from Australia’s literary p ast
came up in Queensland’s Supreme
Court recently Arthur Hoey Davis
67, better known as “Steele Rudd”’
author of “On Our Selection” and father
of the “Dad and Dave” legend.
The will of Davis was lodged in the
Supreme Court for grant of letters of
administration. The sad note of the
story is that his estate, according to
official documents, consists of only £5Ol
gross personalty.
Davis, born at Drayton, near Too-
woomba, Queensland, on November 14,
1868, was the eighth child in a family
of 13. His father, Thomas Davis, was
a blacksmith who had emigrated from
Wales. He was the original of the later
famous “Dad” of his son’s stories.
On their selection the Davis family
lived in poverty. His father had to bor-
row a hoe to work his land.
At 18 Davis had finally had enough
and, landing in Brisbane, he passed an
examination for a clerical position in the
Government service.
Under his new name of Steele Rudd,
Davis was soon bombarding Australian
editors with stories. The Bulletin
editor, J. F. Archibald, asked for more
and Davis later recalled: “Stories came
charging into the office like a herd of
wild brumbies. There was no stopping
them.”
Tn 1899, 26 of The Bulletin stories
were gathered together in a book
called “On Our Selection”. It was the
first of Davis’s major works.
New “Selection” books poured from
Davis. They included “Back at Our
Selection”, “Sandy’s Selection”, “From
Selection to City” and “Granpa’s Selec-
tion”.
A bon vivant, piquant story-teller and
clubman, he never missed startled looks
when he appeared in dinner clothes.
“What did you expect? A man in
moleskin trousers and a cabbage-tree
hat?” he would roar.
Davis lived until 1935 and as the
vogue for “Selection” stories waned he
was often in financial trouble.
Although his grave in Toowong Ceme-
tery remained unmarked for 18 years
until a headstone was erected by public
subscription, Arthur Hoey Davis was not
forgotten by the proud citizens of
Toowoomba.
A fine memorial cairn was erected
near his birthplace at Drayton. It
praised him for having given Australian
literature “the rich gift of honest laugh-
ter, with undertones of the struggles and
sorrows of the pioneers.”


OVERSEAS
The Man in the White Suit
Grivas returns to Cyprus
From a Special Correspondent
ITnder the blistering Cyprus sun the
man in the white suit, who looked
as if he had dropped in from Monte
Carlo, acknowledged the tumultuous
welcome and began to declaim “My duty
towards Cyprus . . . my duty towards
Greece . . . my duty towards Hellen-
ism . .
His rally in Nicosia last week was a
red-letter day for General George Grivas
though, as so often during his histrionic
career, it proved to be only a qualified
triumph. About half the people who had
turned out for his first-ever public ap-
pearance in Cyprus viewed him as their
own special leader. The rest viewed him
as a curiosity.
After three quiet years writing his
memoirs and books on military strategy
somewhat like one of his heroes,
General de Gaulle in a modest villa
26 miles outside Athens, Grivas was
back in Cyprus. A couple of weeks pre-
viously a delegation of enthusiastic Eoka
supporters had visited him in Greece and
it is thought that his return is in answer
to an appeal from them. There is no
reason to suggest either that Archbishop
Makarios invited him or that the Greek
Government suggested the move.
The Grivas story begins in 1898 at
Trikomo, in eastern Cyprus, where he
was born, the second son of a moderately
prosperous seed merchant.
George Grivas was sent to school, to
the Pan-Cyprian Gymnasium in Nicosia,
a nursery of militant Hellenism. He was
a serious youth and not a particularly
good mixer.
While Grivas was there, Greece was
preoccupied with the 1912-13 Balkan
wars and several Cypriots went to Athens
to enlist.
Grivas decided to forgo a proposed
medical career and become a soldier.
After taking Greek citizenship he was
commissioned into the Greek Army.
In 1943, encouraged by friends who
were alarmed at the way Communists
were dominating the resistance move-
ments, Grivas started up his private
army, known by the Greek letter X
(khi). It came to be concerned more
with fighting Communists than Germans
and was, inevitably, branded as Fascist.
In 1946 Grivas turned his movement
into a political instrument. Its ultra-
Right-wing programme included Enosis
(union of Cyprus with Greece) as part of
a new Pan-Hellenism campaign. He
finished near the bottom of the polls,
tried again in 1950 but did little better.
Now an embittered and frustrated
man, Grivas turned his thoughts increas-
ingly to Cyprus. Here, it seemed, was a
vehicle for self-fulfilment. Gradually he
developed a Messianic complex about it.
The war years had seen two other
notable events in his life. He married
an attractive Athenian girl, Kiki Dekas,
who has been a source of strength
through more than 20 turbulent years.
Also he met a young Greek-Cypriot
priest then in Athens, Michael Mouskos.
They had then broadly similar views on
Cyprus and the need for Enosis. Less
than 10 years later Mouskos was en-
throned as Archbishop Makarios. When
it came to selecting a military comman-
der for the Cypriots’ resistance move-
ment he chose Grivas.
Grivas’s tight centralised control of
Eoka’s purely military activities was
astonishing. Every incident, whether an
ambush, sabotage or a killing, was direc-
ted by him. His influence was almost
hypnotic. On hedonistic Cypriots he im-
posed the ruthlessness of his own semi-
puritanical code.
In Cyprus his closest friend is a
middle-aged businessman, Socrates Eli-
ades, with whom he has been staying.
Then there is a hard core of extreme
Right-wing Eoka fighters who from the
outset never accepted the Zurich con-
stitution. Another layer of potential sup-
port comes from the Democratic Union
Party members, who are basically anti-
Makarios but whose opinions cover the
political spectrum from far Right to far
Left.
But, as everyone knows, enormous
ugly question-marks are looming in the
background. What of Makarios? Grivas’
mere presence is a challenge to his
authority and the Archbishop is not going
to allow the leadership to go by default.
Bitter words have passed between them
in the past five years—in 1961 Makarios
accused Grivas publicly of distorting the
truth in his memoirs. And there are basic
differences in their approach to the cur-
rent crisis: Grivas stands full square for
Enosis, Makarios would prefer indepen-
dence. Grivas represents a swing to the
Right at a time when Makarios has been
lurching to the Left. If they can work
effectively together it will be a miracle.
The Turks see him as the arch-apostle
of fanatical Hellenism and do not trust
the fair words of reconciliation of his
recent speeches. If Grivas can by action
prove goodwill towards the Turks, a lot
of other things may be forgiven him.
United Nations officials are optimistic
and some Western diplomats in Nicosia
are clearly batting on his side. Undoubt-
edly Grivas will prove a bulwark against
Communism, but whether he will be a
bulwark that makes for stability or for
hate remains to be seen, (ofns)


Red China’s
Fourth
International
Taking over from Trotsky?
From LAJOS LEDERER
in Warsaw
T>eking has decided to formalise its
A quarrel with Moscow. It is under-
stood here in Warsaw that the Chinese
are preparing to announce the founda-
tion of a Fourth International of Com-
munist Parties.
This would be first to challenge, then
to supersede, the Third International
founded by Lenin in 1919 and thereafter
dominated by Moscow.
The importance of this radical move is
believed to have dominated the talks be-
tween Marshal Tito and Mr Gomulka,
the Polish Communist leader, which
ended here with a short, cautious joint
communique.
In an all-out effort to prevent unity
behind the Moscow line, Peking embark-
ed on the eve of the Yugoslav delega-
tion’s arrival in Warsaw last week on
a new tactical move. The Chinese dip-
lomats and their agents began discreetly
suggesting here and in other East Euro-
pean capitals that the Chinese Commu-
nist Party had decided to launch a break-
away new international movement.
Its aims are supposed to be a truly
revolutionary international of the prole-
tariat based on the original conception of
Marx and Lenin. It will seek the support
of all Communist parties of the have-nots
both inside the Soviet bloc and outside.
In effect it is basically in full accord
with the aims of the stillborn Fourth In-
ternational proclaimed by Trotsky in the
late ’thirties for which he had to pay
with his life. Informed circles in Warsaw
are not disposed to discount the pos-
sibility that Peking’s threats will be put
into force.
One of the main reasons why the
Polish and Yugoslav leaders continually
oppose the world Communist conference
is the fear that if the Chinese are for-
mally condemned they will be forced to
break away from the world movement.
Mr Khrushchev is due to arrive here
on July 22 with a strong party delegation.
It is now expected that the other East
European Communist parties will also
be represented by their leaders.
They are coming here ostensibly for
the celebrations of the twentieth anniver-
sary of Poland’s liberation, but it looks
very likely that this gathering now will be
overshadowed by this new ideological
tactical challenge of the Chinese. (ofnsJ
Indonesia and the
One-Party State
A consistent attack from the PKI
By FRANK PALMOS
(An earlier article on this subject appeared in The Bulletin of July 4)
Discussion in Indonesia on the one-
party system in the last fortnight
has reached “an unprecedented
level”, according to the conservative In-
donesian Christian newspaper “Sinar
Harapan”.
The debate coincided with reports that
Communist-led peasant groups were
gaining influence in Central Java at the
expense of the two other mass parties.
All three main parties, the National-
ist (PNI), Moslem (NU) and Communist
(PKI) have agreed that parties should
not be abolished—but disagree on what
should happen if they are.
There are indications that the PNI
has been offered the “leading role” in
the proposed Vanguard Party in this
event. Its line to date has been “no
change”, or, if there is one, “PNI as
leader of the merger”.
The PKI “People’s Daily” has con-
sistently attacked other Djakarta dailies
for either their lip service to the one-
party idea or their failure to oppose it.
This has brought about a clear split
in the Press, with one side claiming that
support for parties means furthering the
revolution, the other saying a one-party
system would be undemocratic and un-
constitutional.
On June 16 Information Minister
Ruslan Abdulgani visited Attorney-Gen-
eral Kadarusman to discuss the “storm”
over party “simplification”.
This was only four days after the
Moslem party, Nahdatul Ularna, had
issued a five-point “hesitant rejection”
of the plan.
Ruslan Abdulgani, with Defence Min-
ister General Nasution and the Minister
for the Interior, Ipik Gandamana, make
up the committee which will inspect the
lists of membership, financial details, and
assets to be submitted by all parties.
(The order to furnish these details was
issued earlier this month, with the re-
minder « It cai p t 5e postponed again » }

Thls grou P sa y s that Wlth the reten-
tion of parties unhealthy symptoms that
were noticed in the libera! period have
appeared.
“The jostHng for influence (sometimes
with crooked tactics) shows that the
parties still undermine national unity,
and on ]y f avor those skilled in the art
0 f agitation.
“ They feel that simplification to three
parties—the PNI, NU and PKl—would
not be right because many other revolu-
tionary groups are not in these parties,
“The merger should be of ALL
nationalist, religious and socialist groups.
(The proposed grouping includes the
merger of the PKI with Murba, a
National Marxist party.)
“The Nationalists, Moslems and Com-
munists say that if there must be a
simplification, their parties must remain


intact, and there are signs that each of
these parties would want to be the lead-
ers of such a Vanguard Party!
“In Central Java recently, action by
Communist-led peasant groups have
caused anxiety in the ranks of the two
other big parties—so now they face
two challenges.
“On one side they face burial, on the
other a radical movement by the ‘ally
of NASAKOM’ (PKI) which is no less
dangerous.”
The Nahdatul Llama (NU) Party’s
six - point statement was a “hesitant”
rejection:
• The principle of democracy is taught
by Islam, and is one of the five prin-
ciples of PANTJASILA.
• Democracy (guided) can work as
well through the medium of political
parties, which improves Government
by channelling opinion.
• At this stage of the revolution, parties
are an essential component.
• NU cannot agree with the abolition
of the party system because it means
stopping an outlet of public opinion.
• Because there are political parties,
the National Front is able to carry
out its task of leading revolutionary
elements.
• If it is absolutely necessary to
simplify the parties (to NASAKOM)
there must be a guarantee to the
parties that they may still fulfil their
roles as instruments of the revolution.
Meanwhile President Soekarno’s wife,
Hartini, countered this at the newly-
formed INSTITUTE for the NATION’S
UNITY by saying that the revolution
“couldn’t move without unity”, and
Djakarta’s District Commander, Major
Arifin Sugianto, reminded people that
the Political Manifesto had not been
introduced to “allow groups to continue
fighting for their own interests, and creat-
ing disunity”.
“Berita Indonesia” (Indonesian News)
in its editorial on June 6 supported her
by saying that as an “instrument of the
Revolution” it must expound the ideas
of President Soekarno.
Berita attacked the PKI paper,
“People’s Daily”, for criticising those
papers and leaders supporting the one-
party campaign.
The one or Vanguard Party was
necessary, it said, because ever since
the Proclamation of Independence on
August 17, 1945, the idea of one party
has always been with Bung Karno. “It
has not been extinguished, and is in-
extinguishable. IT IS INEVITABLE.
“We are all followers of Bung Karno.
‘Berita Indonesia’ is a tool of the Revolu-
tion led by Bung Karno, and, as an
instrument of the Great Leader of the
Revolution, must voice his ideas. We
must promote, advertise and defend
those ideas.
“The ‘People’s Daily’ can’t courage-
ously face the one-party issue, so it
launches an attack on those who have
been supporting it.”
(“Berita” has pointed out the parties
have always been a failure in Indonesia,
and any current arguments for their
value is lost after any thorough exami-
nation.)
“Warta Berita” (Newscast) ran a more
balanced editorial on June 4:
“With the celebrations of the 19th
year of Pantjasila came the polemics on
the concept of merging existing parties
into one.
“Naturally the big parties are frighten-
ed —and suspicious.
“But the idea isn’t as ‘mad’ as some
people think, though there are problems
as well as benefits.
“In nearly every country which need-
ed to get things done quickly, a one-
party system was used. Russia, China,
and the developing countries like Burma,
The United Arab Republic and several
African States, used one-party.
“But history has taught us a lesson
that one-party systems like the National
Socialist parties of Satans like Mussolini
and Hitler should not be repeated.
“Their trouble was that they had not
one to advise or criticise them.
“It must be admitted that Pantjasila,
the ideal basis for our State, has been
used by certain groups (i.e., the Com-
munists) for alternate aims. For in-
stance, the slogan ‘Agree with Pantjasila
and you must agree with NASAKOM’
is often heard.
“The parties aren’t satisfied. One
asks why it is not in power, though it
has 2i million members. Another says
because 90 per cent of Indonesians are
Moslem, why is it not given more atten-
tion. A third nationalist progressive
says it should have more power with its
2i million membership.
“The one-party concept should at least
be given a chance to develop. The
objections of the parties should be
shelved, and the idea studied thoroughly.
“Bung Karno has reminded party
members that their loyalty to the party
ends where loyalty to country begins.”
On June 2, “Merdeka” (Freedom)
countered Communist criticism of the
Vanguard (or Unity) Party idea by say-
ing the idea was Soekarno’s.
“The concept of one party, or at least
thinning out the parties, should be con-
sidered. We are convinced that the
Revolution could be stepped up if we
fought with greater unity.”
The one-party fight is only just gath-
ering steam. Much will now depend
on the return of General Nasution from
his arms-buying trip from abroad.
Asians
Go Home!
When a Burman tells an Indian
FROM A NEW DELHI CORRESPONDENT
A second wave of nationalism seems to
be moving across this part of Asia,
aimed at inducing foreign Asians the
brown and yellow settlers who have left
their own countries to go home, as
the white rulers did 17 years ago.
Soon, three ships chartered by the
Indian Government will start plying
across the Bay of Bengal between Ran-
goon and Madras.
The service will be kept going until
at least 30,000 Indian nationals de-
prived of their assets and means of liveli-
hood in Burma have been evacuated
by this route.
The fare will be 75 rupees about
£5 10s. As this is all the Burmese will
allow an Indian to take out of the
country the evacuees will be penniless
when they step ashore in Madras. It is
expected that they will go back to their
family villages in South India, though
most of them haven’t lived there for
years, if at all.
Meanwhile, 200 Indians are leaving
Burma by air for Calcutta almost every
day. An Indian Government official told
me that 200,000 Indian Nationals will
probably have to be evacuated from
Burma within the next nine months.
It is evident that laws recently enacted
by the Burmese Government are forcing
them to leave. This week the Govern-
ment of Ceylon promised to introduce a
precisely similar set of laws.
Large numbers of Indians have always
lived in Burma, which used to be an
Indian province. Since Independence, the
total has been halved, and is now thought
to be 500,000. Of these about half are
qualified to become Burmese citizens,
under stringent rules requiring continuous
residence for several decades. Few of
them, however, seem to be snapping up
this opportunity.
The latest Burmese law now persuading
Indians to go provides for the nation-
alisation of retail shops, wholesale ware-
houses and their stocks. A good deal of
this business has been in the hands of
Indians and Chinese.
Treatment of Indians who decide to
leave is evidently harsh. Compensation
has been promised, but none has been
paid; indeed, no legal provision has been
made for its payment. Nor is there any
arrangement for the safekeeping of valu-
ables the Indians are compelled to leave
behind, (ofns)

And Now
Malawi
A Free, Discreet Press
FROM A SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT
VTyasaland has become Malawi, the
’ thirty-seventh independent State in
Africa and the nearest yet to the South.
Malawi (meaning “flames”) was the
name of a Bantu empire 300 years before
Livingstone: but at -62 Malawi’s first
Prime Minister, Dr Hastings Kamuzu
Banda, is not snared by dreams of a
golden past.
The present is too much with him in
the form of a £4 million budget deficit,
no exploitable minerals, and 90 per cent
illiteracy.
On the credit side he can show a
stability which in his lifetime at least
is no illusion, and a five-year develop-
ment plan which Whitehall has com-
mended for good sense.
No Opposition voice has been heard
from a public platform since 1961, when
Dr Banda’s Malawi Congress Party took
95 per cent of all votes cast. At this
year’s general election no one at all
came forward to challenge his personal
nominations.
Dr Banda’s three main lieutenants,
Masauko Chipembere (Education), Kan-
yama Chiume (External Affairs), and
Orton Chirwa (Justice), say that they
have “laid down their stones.” No rivalry
is evident but neither is an obvious
successor.
Significance has been seen in Dr
Banda’s choice of 24-year-old Aleke
Banda as his sole companion at the Com-
monwealth Prime Minister’s Conference
three days after independence, but Aleke
who runs the party newspaper, the
radio and the youth league may have
been chosen to avoid a contentious deci-
sion among the other three.
The trade unions, the Army, the youth
leagues, are firmly in control. The Press
is free, if notably discreet. Tribal feeling
is not visible.
A recent 10 per cent cut in pay for
African civil servants brought out no
hostility.
Malawi has rich, though undeveloped,
soil and depends heavily on outside in-
vestment for the £44 million her five-
year plan requires. For the time being,
Britain will balance the budget, back the
currency, and keep an eye on where the
money goes.
The British-backed Nkula Falls hydro-
electric scheme comparable in prestige
if not in scope with Ghana’s Volta River
project and Egypt’s Aswan dam is
under way, and will speed industrial
development. At present more than half
the gross domestic product comes from
the soil, the economy relying chiefly 0 n
European-grown crops of tea and
tobacco.
The benevolence of Dr Banda’s des-
potism is accepted by most of the
country's 8000 whites, and the pre-in-
dependence flight of capital, mostly
Asian, seems to have stopped.
The number of genuine settlers with
roots in the soil is less than 1000. Only
814 came forward to register on a
European voting poll. The rest are civil
servants, missionaries, teachers, or com-
mercial people on short contracts.
As a result there is no settler problem
to compare with that of Kenya. In Nyasa-
land’s 73 years as a British protectorate
the settler has never ruled, so there is
none of the racial bitterness seething
south of the Zambezi.
The anti-colonial fire of Dr Banda’s
supporters is directed at Sir Roy Welen-
sky and the Federation of Rhodesia and
Nyasaland. which Dr Banda broke last
year, leaving Britain’s reputation un-
tarnished.
Mr lain Macleod, who as Colonial
Secretary released Dr Banda from gaol
in 1960, was present with the Duke of
Edinburgh when the red, green and black
flag of Malawi rose over a cascade of
fireworks, and beacons were lit on all
hills and along the palm-fringed shores of
Lake Nyasa.
Independence was timed to coincide
with the sixth anniversary of Dr Banda’s
return from 40 years’ exile in Britain.
Nine months after his return he was in
gaol. Three years later he was Prime
Minister of a country with three million
people and no obvious means of support.
Tn his 17 months as Prime Minister,
Dr Banda has given his people
universal adult suffrage, the 11,000
Asians a vote for the first time, and the
“Coloreds” (people of mixed blood) a
measure of self-respect. He has allowed
Europeans three seats in the 53-member
National Assembly.
The realities of Malawi’s land-locked
situation limit his choice of friends. He is
on good relations with the Portuguese in
Mozambique, who control Malawi’s life-
line to the coast. Relations with Southern
Rhodesia are, as he puts it, “in a state
of freeze.”
But even if Mr lan Smith were to
plunge Southern Rhodesia into indepen-
dence, “boycott” is a word which Dr
Banda’s position does not allow him to
use.
An element of isolation is called for
in his foreign dealings from Pan-
African as well as Iron Curtain influence
to which his temperament is admir-
ably suited. For him, at any rate, the
white man’s burden holds no hidden
terrors, (ofns)

Asia’s Population Explosion
In 20 years Red China may have 1,600,000,000 people
By E. J. DONATH
Nobody knows the population of
Communist China—by far the
most populous country in the
world. This puzzles students of Chinese
affairs, especially as it is difficult to un-
derstand why the size of the population
should be kept secret. It is possible that
during the Communist regime the popu-
lation of mainland China has increased
by about 200,000,000 people, and might
be close to 800,000,000; many demo-
graphers think that China has an annual
increase of about three per cent. This
would mean that China puts on at least
two Australias in population year by
year.
Professor S. Chandrasekhar, director
of the Indian Institute for Population
Studies, was invited by the Institute for
Foreign Affairs in Peking to study
China's population problems and poli-
cies, and spent two months in China in
1958. He is a demographer of world
renown, and his book on China’s popu-
lation (census and vital statistics) makes
very interesting reading.
At the end of 1954 the State Statistic
Bureau of the Ministry of Internal
Affairs of the People’s Republic of
China announced that the “first com-
plete scientific census” of China had
been conducted and that the nation had
583,000,000 people on June 30, 1953.
Chandrasekhar believes that the figure
is on the whole correct, although only
450,000,000 people were “estimated - ’ to
live in China by nearly all China ex-
perts. For 1953 the crude birth rate was
officially stated to be 37 per 1000 and
the crude death rate as 17/1000; that
means a natural increase of two per cent,
or that China would double its popula-
tion in about 35 years—well before
1990! Chandrasekhar was informed
that the natural increase in 1957 was
2.3 per thousand, and many demogra-
phers think that China's natural increase
might have risen to three per cent. That
means that China would double its
estimated population of perhaps
800,000,000 in about the next two
decades!
/Chandrasekhar writes that the Chinese
Government embarked on a vigorous
nationwide birth control campaign for
nearly three years between 1955 and
1958. The census results, the food
shortage, the general low levels of living
and the overall inability to provide
everyone with basic social services had a
sobering effect on the authorities. This
resulted in the decision to launch a
national campaign for birth control. But
before the family-planning movement
could get under way the blind loyalty to
Marx, contrary to all realistic calcula-
tions, asserted itself and the birth con-
trol campaign was called off in the
middle of 1958. All over the country,
everyone I met assured me that China
was not overpopulated but actually
underpopulated. That was, of course,
in the period of the “Great Leap For-
ward”. However, the reaction against
birth control was not as strong as in the
period before the census of 1954, when
population growth was taken as proof of
the beneficence of socialism, as a source
of power and a cause of dismay to
China's enemies.
In April, 1953, the import of contra-
ceptives, including those prescribed by
physicians, was banned and abortion
was prohibited. The official stand during
this early period of the Communist re-
gime was strong anti-Malthusian Marx-
ism. Then the revealed that in
1953 some 41 per cent of the population
was aged 17 and under—a phenomenal
“baby bulge” that was likely to have
sharp cumulative effects in the next de-
cade. During discussions at the Tenth
Anniversary Celebrations in 1959, Polish
delegates were supposed to have been
told that there would be no real birth
control drive until the country reached a
population of 800,000,000. Then,
according to the reports, the Chinese
would make birth control as much a
patriotic duty as swatting flies or killing
sparrows.
During the birth control campaign of
the middle ’fifties public health cadres
in Shanghai were making public pledges
not to have another child during the

What is the position today? It appears
that birth control has again the support
of the Government. Schools in China
give extremely frank sex education to
pupils and a wide range of birth control
methods are advocated for adults; cheap
male contraceptive devices are mass-
produced, but birth control tablets are
not yet manufactured and are not im-
ported.
A recent report stated that the “Chi-
nese Press reflected a good deal of con-
cern over the birth rate, and though
there was no campaign to parallel that
of 1957, there was still a
drive to raise the marriage age and to
instil into young men and women —
especially students—that their teens and
early twenties were for studying, not
courting. The Press recommended
sterilisation for men rather than for
women and praised couples who pro-
duced only two or three children. A
woman cadre, for example, with only
tw'o children was pointed out in the
magazine ‘Women of China’ as the
possessor of a happy married life as
compared with another woman with five
children . . . the general trend of the
Government seems to be toward a
muted drive for smaller families”.
By the early 1980 s the continent of
Asia will have a population larger than
the world population of today, and
China alone will have more than one
billion people! As an Asian demogra-
pher put it recently: “We are afraid far
more of the results of sexual energy than
of atomic energy.”
Soekarno’s optimism
Come Asian countries have halved their
death rate within the last 20 years
without any real decline in their birth
rate. So, it is not surprising that Ceylon
has nearly doubled its population since
1937, the Philippines has more than
doubled its population, and so has Thai-
land and Brunei. Sarawak is supposed
to have a natural increase of five per
cent, which means it will double its
population in the next 14 years.
Neighboring North Borneo or Sabah has
an annual net increase of four per cent,
and Cambodia and Laos of over three
per cent.
However, Dr Soekarno does not seem
to worry. He recently declared that
Indonesia could easily support
250,000,000 people, although the vast
majority of its 100,000,000 impoverished
people might think differently. Nobody
really knows Indonesia’s population, as
since the “revolution” the administration
has been so poor that no properly orga-
nised census has been undertaken. How-
ever, there is no doubt that birth rate
is extremely high there and the popula-
tion is fast increasing.
In Latin America, too, the current rate
of increase in population growth is un-
precedented.
Many countries will again double their
population in the next twenty years, such
as Ceylon, Philippines, Thailand, South
Korea, Cambodia, and most likely In-
donesia, too. What chance do they have
to raise the standard of living of their
millions in the face of such a fantastic
increase? Since the beginning of the
Colombo Plan, only a little more than
ten years ago, the Asian Colombo Plan
countries have increased their population
by nearly 200 million. Truth and fiction
are mixed in some of the current disr
cussions on the likelihood of “standing
room only” on this planet of ours or that
of the approaching shortage of food by
the end of this century when the world’s
population might be close to
7,000,000,000,000.

the possibility of a nuclear war and the
continued unprecedented increase in
world population were the two greatest
dangers to mankind in the remaining
years of this century. Eugene R. Black,
former President of the International
Bank for Reconstruction and Develop-
ment, wrote recently that “unless popu-
lation growth can be restrained, we may
have to abandon for this generation our
hopes of economic progress in the
crowded lands of Asia and the Middle
East”.
Death control
ironic aspect of the really tragic
-*• population increase in the poorest
parts of the world is that it was brought
about by one of the greatest of man’s
achievements the amazing decline in
mortality rates.
Into these underdeveloped countries
where birth rates have always been high,
and where they still remain so, modern
medicine has entered with its latest
knowledge of epidemiology and its pano-
ply of disinfectants, insecticides, vac-
cines and antibiotics, and has thereby
succeeded in suddenly and drastically re-
ducing their death rates. Death control,
to an amazing degree, has been success-
ful over large parts of our globe, at a
time when birth control has hardly com-
menced there. In many of the so-called
backward countries, infant mortality has
been lengthened by many years; how-
ever, most of the women still bear as
many children as they physiologically
can. Reductions in the rate of deaths,
which took 100 years in Europe, are
now taking place in neighboring Asian
countries in a few years. A high birth
rate, only very slowly declining in some
of the “crowded countries”, and a fast
declining death rate sustained over a few
decades must certainly lead to a “popu-
lation explosion”. About a hundred
years ago, population growth in Asia
was at the rate of about 0.4 per cent
a year requiring a period of 175 years
for numbers to double, but today, in
most parts of Asia, the increase is well
over two per cent which requires only
about 30 years for doubling the popu-
lation.
Here are a few examples: India’s birth
rate is still 40 per 1000 as it was 20
years ago but its death rate has declined
from 28 to nearly 20! over the last 20
years, death rate has declined in Ceylon
from 20 to 9, in Malaya from 20 to 10,
Thailand from 17 to 8, and Taiwan
from 20 to 8. Most of these and other
Asian countries have still a birth rate of
about 40 (as compared with 22 in Aus-
tralia, and well below 20 in most Euro-
pean countries and in Japan) but their
death rate has been reduced from over
30 to under 20, and many are right down
to Australia’s death rate of nine per 1000.
Here lies the clue to the “population
cyclone” that is fast developing not very
far from this continent.
The Indian authorities were astounded
when the 1961 census revealed a popu-
lation of 438,000,000, about 10,000,000
more than was estimated in their Five-
Year Development Plan. Currently,
India’s population increases by two and
a half per cent a year (as compared with
one per cent in the ’twenties!) and so
there will be about 470,000,000 people
in India by now. Every year India puts
on more than one Australia in popula-
tion, and by 1974 there will be
120,000,000 MORE people to be fed,
clothed and housed. One hundred and
twenty million is more than double the
total population of Britain, and that is
what India is going to add in the next
10 years to its undernourished millions.
Mr Chagla, India’s former ambassa-
dor to the United States, said last year
that “we are facing a volcanic eruption
—if we can check our population it
would make all the difference between
poverty and plenty”. And Sir John
Crawford, a leading Australian econo-
mist who knows India well, said two
years ago that “if India does not make
the break-through economically in this
early period, the probability that econo-
mic, social and political disruption on a
wide scale will occur before 1980 will be
high”. A Ford Foundation agricultural
team visiting India in 1959 drew the
alarming picture that by 1966 the food
gap would be 28 million tons and no
conceivable programme of imports or
rationing could meet a crisis of this
magnitude. India has received massive
food aid from the United States in
recent years, and nevertheless, recent
reports about the current food situation
are disturbing.
In order to stem the “population
explosion” the Indian Government
established nearly 10,000 family plan-
ning clinics in rural areas where sheaths,
jellies and foam tablets could be
obtained free of charge. In addition
sterilisation has been encouraged by the
payment of a small sum. Sterilisation
is allowed only if there are three child-
ren in a family, and about half a million
have volunteered. About 40,000 sterili-
sations are carried out each year, and
in the current Five-Year Plan about
£50,000,000 has been allotted for birth
control measures. The Government of
Thailand recently sent a team to Japan
to study methods for organising a
family-planning programme. Japan is
the only Asian country which has suc-
ceeded in reducing its birth rate —to
even below that of Australia. Japan’s
annual increase in population is only
about one per cent, as compared with
Australia’s natural increase of 1.3 per
cent. In addition to India, Japan and
Thailand, Pakistan, Fiji, Singapore,
South Korea and Egypt have established
programmes for slowing down the in-
crease in their population.
Anovulants
progress has been made in
efficient methods of birth control,
especially the recent introduction of
anovulants; research is well advanced
for the manufacture of a once-a-year-
pill. In the laboratory stage are a num-
ber of other methods, including im-
munisation or vaccination. The famous
English biologist, Julian Huxley, recently
made the interesting suggestion that “a
group including both underdeveloped
and developed nations say, India and
Pakistan, Norway and Australia —should
introduce a resolution into the United
Nations Assembly calling for concerted
thought and action on world population”.
If nothing is done, Thomas Malthus will,
after all, be right; 160 years ago he
foresaw that in a race between produc-
tivity and reproductivity, reproductivity,
if unchecked, would win out in the end.
Between 1900 and 1950, the world
population increased from 1,550,000,000
to 2,550,000,000 but it will take only
20 years to add another 1,000,000,000,
and at the end of the century it will
take only one decade! Asia’s population
increased in the first half of this century
by 450,000,000 but it will increase by
2,600,000,000 in the second half! By
the year 2000 the continent of Asia
might have to feed 4,000,000,000 people
—about one-third MORE than the
world’s total population today! A Cana-
dian television lecturer said recently
that “not the bomb but the womb is the
greatest danger to world peace”!

Exit with Laughter
Stanley Kubrick ' s nuclear comedy
By BEVERLEY TIVEY
Doctor Strangelove, Or How I Learned
To Stop Worrying And Love The
Bomb. Director, Stanley Kubrick.
Victory Theatre. Sydney.
T firmly believe that there should be
some sort of law passed compelling
everybody to see “Doctor Strangelove”.
As well as being a dazzling technical
achievement in film-making, this is one
of the most forthright and honest exposi-
tions of just what we’ve got ourselves
into.
There are those who will avoid the
film because they prefer to turn their
backs to any unpleasant subject (just as
the honest citizens who lived within sight
and smell of the smoking chimneys of
the extermination camps “didn’t realise”
what was going on there). Others may
feel uneasily that the ultimate weapon
is not a thing to be funny about.
But Kubrick shows genius in choos-
ing a comic treatment. Laughter is the
only way to face the concept of man’s
self-destruction. Consider it seriously
and your mind can’t help veering away
into more comforting channels. So
Kramer’s “On The Beach”, an eminently
sincere film, turned into a rather encour-
aging picture of the noble way people
meet inevitable death.
We’ve got so clever now that most
nations possess an ultimate weapon
which they hope never to use. This
extraordinarily witty and exciting film
shows us just how easily we may finish
ouselves off. All you need is a top-
level military man who has gone quietly
mad. The machinery is set in motion,
and just try to stop it!
The excruciating part is that no one
event in the film is really outrageously
improbable. Kubrick has merely point-
ed out how dependent men are on each
other’s foibles —how in fact the world
may end because of the obsession of
one man in command, the ill-timed in-
sobriety of a political leader, or lack of
change for a public telephone.
But though the film never loses sight
of its cataclysmic subject, it’s a fine
piece of entertainment, imaginative,
funny and with genuine suspense. Tech-
nically it is a prodigious achievement,
and the casting and acting (Sterling
Hayden, George C. Scott, and Peter Sel-
lers playing three roles) beyond criticism.
From his earliest days Kubrick has
been an original and interesting director,
and “Doctor Strangelove” is his
greatest achievement both in technical
skill and in the expression of his par-
ticular thesis. He is not overtly anti-
religious, but there is a basic denial
of religion in his total negation of the
idea of a Higher Authority. All his
films show man’s destiny governed by
other men and by his own weaknesses.
In “The Killing” a group of failures
plans the perfect crime that is to free
them from their own miserable lives; but
even before its commission they have
destroyed its chance of success by their
own envy and greed.
In “Paths Of Glory” the three scape-
goats in World War I are victims of the
mere fact of being human, and even the
officers who condemn them are under-
mined by their execution.
“Spartacus” has a similar argument
with a secondary Kubrick theme (also
seen in “Lolita”) —the destruction of a
dream when the dreamer tries to fit it
into ordinary life, which inevitably
involves the other people who cannot
help but destroy it.
Qo Spartacus’ slave rebellion fails and
he is left crucified and dying (the
faintly “inspirational” tone of the ending,
which implied that the work would go
on, was not Kubrick’s choice (I believe).
So, too, in “Lolita”, Humbert Humbert’s
romantic dream (“forever wilt thou
love, and she be young”) is doomed
first by feared social disapproval which
forces him into a life of flight and
deception, second by Lolita herself, who
grows out of the situation and wants to
take her normal place in the world.
Now comes “Doctor Strangelove”,
with its frightening and beautiful final
sequence, when mushroom clouds blos-
som lazily to the bitterly ironic accom-
paniment of Vera Lynn singing “We’ll
Meet Again”. How, it may be asked,
can the pessimistic Kubrick be so light-
hearted? No problem: it’s the optimists,
who live in a state of continual dis-
appointment, who are the gloomy ones.
THEATRE
Poverty and
Goodness
The Caucasian Chalk Circle. Bertolt
Brecht. Old Tote Theatre. Sydney.
Teased on a medieval Chinese play
called “The Chalk Circle”, Brecht’s
play is set in medieval Russia, in the
Caucasian province of Grusinia. During
a revolt Georgi Abashvili, the Governor
of Nuka, is murdered by the Palace
Guards and his wife flees for her life.
So concerned is she about packing her
favorite dresses that she leaves behind
her baby son Michael, the heir to the
Abashvili estates. When everyone else
has fled, the abandoned baby is
rescued by the kitchenmaid Grusha, who
takes him into the Northern Mountains,
pursued at every step by the Ironshirts,
for the infant has a price on his head.
After two years, order is restored and
the high-born mother returns to claim
her child from the kitchenmaid. But
Grusha stubbornly maintains that the
child is hers. The case is decided by
the witty Azdak, a disreputable village
intellectual, who has been made judge
in the topsy-turvy conditions following
the revolt. A kind of Don Quixote and
Sancho Panza rolled into one, he sits
on the Statute Book, which he uses as
a cushion, and dispenses rule-of-thumb
justice rather than the law. By fleecing
the rich to succor the poor, he con-
stitutes a sort of one-man Welfare State.
To determine who is the true mother of
the child he applies the test of the chalk
circle.
Using this simple folk-tale as a basis,
Brecht has created a play which has
both simplicity and richness, the time-
lessness of fable and the immediacy of
today’s weather. Because of its mixture
of homely detail and high seriousness, its
condemnation of the rich as proud and
cold-hearted, and its celebration of the
poor as good and simple-hearted, “The
Caucasian Chalk Circle” is strongly
reminiscent of the New Testment. The
atmosphere of the play is more Christian
than Communist. But of course Brecht
did not believe in God. Instead, the
conventions of the folk-story prevail:
the good triumph by virtue of their
good wits and their courage, while the
bad are confounded by their own
stupidity and wickedness.
But, if this description makes the
characters sound abstract or lifeless,
nothing could be more misleading.
Brecht’s realism is Shakespearian in its
liveliness. And, like Shakespeare, he
manages to combine realism and poetry.
Because he is not stuck with naturalism,

with exactly copying everyday life, he
does not have the problems of realist
dramatists who have to try to get a
poetic largeness while preserving the
appearance of ordinary life. Brecht uses
a narrator to comment upon the action,
he inserts songs, he has half his actors
wearing masks, and yet still has more
naturalness and vivid realism than the
realists.
According to his theory, all these
devices are supposed to alienate the
audience from the story: to stop them
from feeling and make them think. But
this is not what happens at all. This is
a highly romantic and emotional play,
though Brecht’s humor and realism save
it from being sentimental. My com-
panion on the first night, who was seeing
the play for her first time, wept copiously
throughout the performance. So much
for alienation!
What gives this play its wonderful
vitality is the liveliness of the two central
characters Grusha and Azdak. Both
are familiar, traditional figures. Grusha
is elemental: down-to-earth, patient and
strong, she is the eternal mother-figure,
born to suffer for her children. Azdak
is a kind of father-figure: witty and
sharp-tongued and iconoclastic, he hides
his pity for his fellow-sufferers beneath
a rough unceremoniousness.
Neither Anna Volska as Grusha nor
Ron Haddrick as Azdak, although each
gives an attractive performance, quite
succeeds in getting these characters right.
Anna Volska is a girlish Grusha, a little
too highly-strung. She conveys very well
Grusha’s passionate indignation against
cold - heartedness, but she does not
capture her patient strength, her trans-
parent simplicity. Ron Haddrick also
emphasises indigation: he is a harsh and
angry Azdak, but he does not do justice
to the benign pity underneath.
The supporting cast (an impressive
assembly) play their dual and triple
roles with great liveliness and each little
characterisation is a delight.
Richard Campion, assisted by Wendy
Dickson’s sets, gives us a busy, colorful,
Brueghel - like production which is
thoroughly enjoyable and should not be
missed.

Tall Story
The Golden Legion of Cleaning
Women. Alan Hopgood. Union
Theatre Repertory Company. Rus-
sell Street Theatre. Melbourne.
Alan Fopgood’s new play (if that is
not too strong a word) is very
similar in shape and style to last year’s
model, “And the Big Men Fly”—that is
to say. it is a dramatised tall story. The
setting purports to be the world of big
business, and the idea is to show what
might happen if the cleaning women in
our office buildings ever thought of ex-
ploiting the opportunities for scavenging
and eavesdropping which come their way
in the course of the day’s unobtrusive
work. Financial empires might fall, we
are (more or less) persuaded; betting
plunges come unstuck; even the nation’s
parliament might be shaken.
Mr Hopgood develops his idea with
considerable inventiveness, and the even-
ing passes pleasantly. There are some
clever visual effects as the women’s
basement cubbyhole is transformed into
the nerve-centre of a vast secret enter-
prise, complete with electronic gadgets,
illuminated map, and so on; and plenty
of local and topical jokes are worked
in along the way. The best thing in a
generally good performance is the
laconic, side-of-the-mouth comedy of
Diana Bell.

fThiE long-playing record has been a
A mixed blessing for jazz. Ideal for
preserving the best work of an individual
or a group, it too often allows musicians
an excess of wax on which to repeat
themselves. The discipline imposed by
the time limitation of the old 78 r.p.m.
record was generally beneficial to jazz
performances: only rarely are jazz com-
positions worthy of longer treatment
and those jazzmen capable of sustain-
ing interest over a prolonged period are
few. The concentrated effort plus the
greater enthusiasm which prevailed in
pre-tape days more often than not
resulted in better recordings.
For this reason the anthological LP
which collects together these otherwise
unavailable performances is always
welcome. Asking a dozen of America’s
best-known critics to pick their favorite
records from the CBS catalogue is a
reasonable excuse for such a collection
and, in this case, has furnished the
mature jazz-lover with a stimulating
and varied recital. Men like John Ham-
mond, Nat Hentoff, Leonard Feather
and Willis Conover know their jazz and
it would be pointless to criticise their
preferences, especially as, confronted by
a choice like this, nostalgia rather than
careful reasoning would inevitably be
the deciding factor.
It is significant that, of the twelve
tracks, 10 are by Negro groups and,
with the exception of Bessie Smith’s
“Baby Doll” and Miles Davis’ “So
What”, all the selections fit best into
the mainstream category.
Three pleasing, but nevertheless puzz-
ling, selections are Jimmy Lunceford’s
“Baby, Won't You Please Come Home”,
Claude Thornhill’s “Portrait of a
Guinea Farm” and Martial Solal’s “In-
ternational Blues”. There is fine music
on all three, but it is difficult to discern
the qualities which lift them into the
first preference class.
Not surprisingly, Duke Ellington is
the only musician to be the choice of
more than one critic. He is represented
by “Happy Reunion” (featuring the sen-
sitive tenor-sax of Paul Gonsalves), an
atmospheric blues called “Blue Light”,
and an exhilarating “Downtown Uproar”
which, as its selector, John S. Wilson,
comments, is “a definitive illustration of
the meaning of the verb ‘to swing’.”
Four choices which I heartily endorse
are Lester Young’s “Lady Be Good”
(with the 1936 Basie band and one of
Young’s first and finest recordings); a
little-known Armstrong masterpiece from
his most fertile period, “Lord, You Made
the Night Too Long”; Goodman’s
“Benny Rides Again”, an Eddie Sauter
arrangement with the clarinettist at his
peak; and the unique “Blues in C-sharp
Minor” by a Teddy Wilson group in
which all the elements of truly great
jazz recording are present.
The Miles Davis track, “So What”,
comes from an important and influential
session, one which, as well as establish-
ing the melancholy lyricism of the Davis
horn, revealed the artistic possibilities
of modal playing in jazz.
I find less over which to enthuse in
“The Jazz Greats of Modern Times”,
but this may be more the fault of ears
attuned to an earlier period than that
of the music offered. Even though many
of the great innovators are missing, there
are enough progressive musicians of good
reputation present to justify the album’s
title.
A delicate piano and guitar duet by
Bill Evans and Jim Hall establishes a
reflective mood that John Coltrane (on
track two) immediately destroys with a
piece of anti-jazz entitled “Double
Clutching”. I react violently to this

avant-garde saxophonist. He may be
breaking new ground, but I would
prefer him to break it where I can’t
hear him. More knowledgeable critics
than I are convinced of his sincerity but
there are times when it is difficult to
believe he is not playing with his tongue
in his cheek; the ugliness of his tone
suggests that he has it half-way down
his mouthpiece.
“Main Theme from ‘Odds Against
Tomorrow’ ” introduces an augmented
Modern Jazz Quartet which, dominated
as usual by Milt Jackson’s vibraphone,
sounds, not unpleasantly, like an under-
water church service. In contrast,
“Money Jungle” by Duke Ellington,
Charlie Mingus and Max Roach has the
muscular vitality one would expect from
this mingling of talents and the 65-year-
old Ellington once again impresses with
his adaptability.
That greatest of jazz singers, Billie
Holiday, is at her expressive best in “I
Cover the Waterfront” and seems un-
daunted by a stodgy accompaniment that
makes one pine for the Teddy Wilson
pick-up groups which once supported
her to perfection.
Gerry Mulligan and Herbie Mann
both contribute typical performances,
Mulligan armed with baritone-sax and
a big band, Mann with his flute and
Latin-American percussion. “When
Lights are Low” and “Fair Weather”, as
played by the combos of Art Blakey
and Art Farmer respectively, are full
of the jerky phrasing, meaningless tech-
nical exhibitions and disrespect for
melody which makes difficult listening
of so much modern jazz. Last and, in
my opinion, least is a gentleman who
calls himself King Pleasure offering a
dreadful distortion of the old ballad,
“I'm In the Mood For Love”.
This would be a reasonable purchase
for the impecunious collector who
merely wishes to have the modern school
represented in his record library.
TOM PERKINS
ART
Kmit in America
Michael Kmit. Dominion Galleries.
Sydney.
jpEW art enthusiasts will have forgotten
Michael Kmit’s work during the
years spent in California. On the odd
occasions when a few paintings were
shown they indicated a tenacity of style
in the face of what must have been a
considerable onslaught of contemporary
US art. That this inevitably has had its
effect is revealed in one or two transi-
tional abstracts, rather impulsive things,
all drips, spatters and rich enamelled
color.
However, the bulk of these thirty
paintings might conceivably have come
from any one of the last six years. One
of the best, entitled “The Protagonist”,
has some of the enigmatic appeal be-
longing to the more subtle “St Mark”,
of 1953, in the NSW Art Gallery. Where
once Kmit’s color harmonies trilled
brilliantly through a gamut of childlike
vivacity, sombre chords of deep blue
sound as constant bass notes. Gone is
the incredibly-complex mosaic of color
touches, though the remnant of the old
geometry shines through simpler areas.
Form is simpler, more directly appre-
hended, more attuned to reality and, of
course, less magical. The reminders, the
echoes of unalloyed wonder have retired.
Kmit has, over many years, created
his own unique portrait gallery. They
are of girls, identical in basic face struc-
ture though as variable in slight ways as
moods change. A three-quarter face,
nose half in profile, a swept-back mop
of rich dark hair greet us from a dozen
pictures. In one or two instances there
has been a transformation of an actual
sitter. They charm, they delight yet
partake of their author’s unease.
“La Rencontre” shows a painter and a
girl, their sharply differentiated heads
create a mood of surprise as if the girl
had just materialised out of nowhere.
The religious works do carry a greater
inner tension than before in the more
decorative phases of Kmit’s oeuvre,
though he has never strayed far from
decoration. Byzantium, Chagall, the
fantasies of childhood, have all contribu-
ted to this development; all have re-
ceded as Kmit has matured beneath the
surface of a talent that has gained him
a place in Australian art equivalent to
Campigli’s in Italy.

Rubinstein’s
Greatness
Piano Recital. Artur Rubinstein.
Town Hall. Sydney.
llThereas most pianists would be court-
” ing disaster in presenting a pro-
gramme consisting of Beethoven’s
“Moonlight” Sonata, Schumann’s “Car-
naval”, and some short pieces by Debussy
and Chopin, Artur Rubinstein at his
first Sydney appearance was able to turn
such a programme into one of the most
engrossing recitals heard in years. Only
a Rubinstein could have done this with
material so familiar, and it was worth
while hearing it done; nevertheless, it
is a pity that Rubinstein was not heard
in a programme that would have made
more demands on his audience’s powers
of comprehension than on their
memories.
Rubinstein excelled in the Debussy
and Chopin items, with their refined
temper, suave finish, and superb ex-
ploitation of piano sonorities. As a
Chopin player he is in a class of his
own, combining virtuosity of the highest
degree with great sensitivity and direct-
ness of presentation. Under his hands,
even a work as well-known as the
Scherzo in C sharp minor had the fresh-
ness of something being newly per-
formed. The maudlin, rather effete
Chopin of some other pianists sfeemed
never to have existed.
Rubinstein’s greatest virtue is the
spontaneity and lack of affectation of
his playing, even in the most hackneyed
encore piece. It was this that con-
stituted the major attraction of his
account of the “Moonlight” Sonata, and
which compensated for his tendency to
exaggerate and dwell on the romantic
character of his work by slight and brief
variations of volume, tempo and attack.
These variations, however, were never
merely wayward (as they might have
been had the pianist been, say, Lili
Kraus), but were founded on a clear
and consistent view of the work. Even
when one did not agree with this con-
ception, it was impossible not to respect
its genuineness, and impossible not to
admire the artistry and integrity with
which Rubinstein executed it.

Genius of the Inland
The threat to Aboriginal art
By JOHN HENSHAW
Australian Aboriginal Art. Editor
R. M. Berndt. Ure Smith. 117 s. 6d.
Roland M. Berndt has edited this
handsome volume, with chapters by
A. P. Elkin, F. D. McCarthy, C. P.
Mountford, T. G. Strehlow, J. A. Tuck-
son and 73 color plates to illustrate the
text. The idea has been to do two
things as well as possible: to provide
short informative chapters by leading
anthropologists which won’t be too dif-
fuse, with a contrasting viewpoint of an
art critic-historian, and to present a good
selection of bark painting, sculpture, and
a few photographs. By Australian
standards the plates are excellent, the
whole production going far to substanti-
ate the publisher’s claim that “this is the
richest, most comprehensive, most beau-
tiful book ever published on the tradi-
tional art of the Australian Aborigines”.
The contributors make a formidable
list, all of whom have made valuable
efforts to penetrate the barrier which
separates the white from the Aboriginal
mind, sometimes with startling results.
Most are well known through their
books. This deep concern for a culture
and way of life which has surprised and
delighted everyone who takes the trouble
to look, is fittingly expressed by
T. G. H. Strehlow in his chapter on the
art of the central Australians: “The close
ties between Aboriginal art and religion
throughout inland Australia —ties which
constituted the great source of its inner
strength and deep emotional appeal in
pre-European days—inevitably led to-
ward its rapid eclipse when alien settle-
ment began in the interior. Cattlemen
with their stock desecrated the sacred
sites, if they were close to permanent
waters (as they frequently were), and
drove out the guardians of the sacred
storehouses. Many missionaries, espe-
cially in the early days, refused to allow
their converts to take any part whatso-
ever in any ritual. In our own days
many Government officials are adopting,
in the name of assimilation, an equally
hostile attitude toward Aboriginal cul-
ture, religion, and art. In the face of
so much active European antagonism,
Aboriginal religion, art, and culture are
rapidly dying in inland Australia. In my
view this is nothing less than a national
tragedy.”
The content of the book is largely
anthropological. R. M. Berndt discusses
in broad terms the nature of Aboriginal
art, stressing its unity with mythico-
religious and other forms of social life.
A. P. Elkin links it with the totemic
ritual of the “dreaming”. C. P. Mount-
ford analyses the shaping, through its
various technical stages, of the bark
painting of Arnhem Land. He provides
interesting diagrams explaining the forms
of two paintings reproduced in color.
F. D. McCarthy sweeps fascinatingly
through the world of the painted gallery
and the engraved rock while T. G. H.
Strehlpw deals with the more abstract
forms of Central Australia.
A basic assumption underlies the an-
thropological attitude which views Abori-
ginal art through its social, mythico-
religious background. This attitude is
the academic Aristotelian one. Aesthetic
satisfaction resides largely in the recog-
nition of the subject as such and such a
being or event. Anthropology states
meanings in verbal concepts. This know-
ledge certainly does not necessarily
diminish one’s appreciation, but it may
be a substitute for it.
As Aboriginal culture diminishes, white
curiosity increases. To the lay
person a full understanding of mytho-
poeic thought is extremely difficult. It
presupposes a pushing back into a kind
of picture-thinking, non-intellectual and
entirely lacking in the sharpness, clarity
and analytic skill which we take for
granted. When we buy an Aboriginal
painting and hang it on the wall it has
been removed completely from its con-
text, artistic or social. The problem is
one of how far it can be appreciated.
Aesthetic quality implies a direct
experience, not a secondhand one. In
all art there lies the attempt to bridge
the gap between the personal and the
universal. Since Aboriginal culture is
deeply reflective of nature with its
seasonal events, there will be corres-
ponding evidence in its forms. If art
participates in religion, painting, dance,
carving, ritual, music and song will for
the most part belong together. Paint-
ing will not strive intentionally for
realism but will remain two-dimensional.
(Sculptural effect in art only came into
being with increased intellectual and
self awareness.)
Let us look at this space. Imagery is
supported by it as though the surface
itself is treated as a kind of active
“field”. This hints at a very direct
sensuous experience where everything ii
“alive”. Regional styles indicate this
sort of thing with masses of hatched
line which surround human and animal
form. Others concentrate on the rich
complement of hair, nails, skin, fins,
bony plates and so on, as well as a fine
array of internal organs. Surfaces are
always respected and the blank spaces
in such images become part of the com-
position, because of their placing. Paint-
ings are not cut dead rectangular but
follow the natural, “organic” geometry,
the shape dominates the treatment of
motif.
With the viewpoint from any angle
one expects imaginative use of subject
as a tableau of successive events seen
together. The fact of having to turn
a bark around on the ground removes
us from the fixity of viewpoint which
dominates our own art. Space unfolds
here as a panorama. Multiple view
implies the seeing of objects from above,
the side or below and making a compo-
site flat image as in a head seen profile
with two eyes.
Structural expression is implied
through an interplay of linear tensions,
the use of transparencies heightens
rather than reduces our impression of
an object. In cave art the images are
multiplied, related perhaps to one
another but not necessarily composed
within a given area. Roughness or con-
tour can suggest a form.
If we begin with concrete things, line,
space, we can gain some insights into
how the artist “sees”. Usually gesture,
acutely observed, summarises animal
form, together with its richness of tex-
ture. Human movement, on the other
hand, is sensed from within as in the
case of the elongation of a spear-throw-
ing arm. Inner tension becomes out-
wardly projected, an indication of a
deep physical awareness. Disembodied
spooks are graphically treated as bone-
less entities whose forms writhe like
rags on a clothesline. Demons may be
sketched on as dark or smoky grounds
as the great creative Wandjina spirits
appear to radiate light. Even wholly
abstract compositions have their rela-
tion to the way line is used in other
kinds of painting. If the meaning is so
completely separate from the graphic
image that it bears no relation to it, one
suspects our anthropologist friends are
on the wrong track in their explanations.
Mr Berndt takes J. A. Tuckson to
task in the epilogue for just such an
aesthetic approach as I have briefly sug-
gested here. I believe it to be a realistic
one in view of our position; however, it
is heartening that the two viewpoints
can be printed together in one volume.
It is also heartening to notice the keen
interest shown by these writers in the
future of our last big centre of indigen-


ous art, in Arnhem Land, which is
rapidly crumbling under pressures from
outside. When, for instance, one sees
barks cut to fit a packing case, at a
mission, the end is near. Outside de-
mands have dictated subject matter and
an actual improvement in draughtsman-
ship in some cases actually means a loss
of quality! Hermansburg “white” art
is not enthused about, as being the work
of the detribalised artist.
With its well-chosen end papers, firm
binding, good layout, excellent annota-
tions and plates, this book is our best
introduction to Aboriginal art yet pub-
lished in Australia.
Golden Boy
Rupert Brooke. Christopher Hassall.
Faber & Faber. 635. 6d.
T>upert Brooke's fame rests on his
symbolic beauty and on half a
dozen poems: the five war sonnets and
“Grantchester”. He belongs to that class
of Englishmen who are loved because
they embody the longing of a whole
nation for a lost youth and innocence.
The play that made the most lasting
impression on him was “Peter Pan”.
Brooke was in love with boyhood and
death, and there are things in his life
which make one believe that he would
have approved of the time and mode of
his dying. But it is not his fault that
he has been chosen to stand for ever
as the Marvellous Youth. Had not a
mosquito given him a fatal bite on the
way to Gallipoli he might have deve-
loped into a brilliant pessimist—he had
all that goes to make one.
To us he is one of the last poets of
Beauty, a chivalrous melancholy sensua-
list. It is strange to think that con-
temporary critics once chided him, on
rather slender evidence, for his cult
of ugliness. It would have been more
just to single out a far graver defect in
his work; a certain clever childishness
which it took the war to rid him of.
In “Grantchester” and a few other
poems this is transmuted into genuine
feeling strengthened by wit. Yet the
flaw seems inherent in his altitudes and
only a profound patriotic emotion,
which at the same time promised a solu-
tion to individual problems, helped him
to overcome it. Whether the victory
would have been permanent no one can
say.
He apparently saw little fighting in
Belgium with the Royal Naval Division
and was spared the grim reality of the
Dardanelles. There is nothing in his
poetry before the war nor, for that
matter, is there much in any other
English poetry —which contained a fore-
boding recognition that an age was
ending. Almost all the poets of the
holocaust were lyrically backward look-
ing, in marked distinction to the war
poets of the next generation. It was
left to the European painters and nove-
lists to give warning in their work. The
sense of loneliness that we get from
Sassoon and Owen and, more muted,
from Brooke reflects the isolation of the
artistic Englishman in general, but at
an historic juncture it fused with the
national mood of regret. It is ironic that
these melancholy and gifted young men,
among whom the survivors became a
truly lost band, were hailed as the
voice of the finest hour. Theirs was a
ritual sacrifice.
Rupert Brooke emerges from Christo-
pher Hassall's biography as a sensitive
and cheerful rebel whose joy deserted
him before he could come to grips with
his cause. He regarded himself, of all
things, as a Fabian. Two influences
were competing to shape his outlook at
Cambridge and already at Rugby: the
aesthetic anti-Victorianism of Wilde and
Beardsley and the political optimism of
Shaw and the Webbs. Material fortune
favored him. Between the afterglow of
fin de siecle “constructive decadence”
and an artless enthusiasm for Poor Law
Reform he strove to find his authentic
self. But essentially and by instinct he
was a Tory, and it is fitting that his
greatest admirer was Winston Churchill.
His most productive teacher was St John
Lucas and the well-known young radi-
cals of the period were his friends, James
Strachey, Hugh Dalton and the Keynes
brothers, but as soon as he encountered
unconventionality he was repelled, and
blamed the disintegrating force of
modernism. Uncritically he welcomed
the war, and it is surely fair to say that
it saved him from having to make an
important choice.
One gets the impression that, rather
like T. E. Lawrence, Brooke would
always have found it hard to integrate
his personality. The reasons may have
been similar too: an inability to cope
with the feminine element. His father,
a house-master at Rugby, played no
great part in his life but his mother, the
“Ranee”, dominated it in a complex way
which Mr Hassall does not care to in-
vestigate closely. Brooke was barely
out of his teens when he underwent a
crisis which is common in middle-aged
men. Suspended between two women,
one a school girl, Noel Olivier, and the
other the demanding Ka Cox, he tried
to have both by escaping from each.
With Ka Cox he worked a clinically
perfect projection, down to the point of
bombarding her with letters to assist her
to break free from him ... At the age
of twenty-five he looked with envy at
fond lovers. His devotion to Cathleen
Nesbitt was safe because he could not
see himself the husband of a career
woman, an
This is an ample, engaging book, if
too rich in secondary detail from the
pre-Cambridge days. It is well illustra-
ted. Brooke died, of course, too early
to make a good subject for a reflective
biography, but his social and literary
background is extremely interesting. It
was sunny and sheltered to a degree that
today is hard to imagine, yet he can
hardly be said to have been happy. What
frightened him most was the thought of
ageing. His birthday letters are highly
revealing in this respect.
In 1910 he produced a plan which
tells us a great deal about him and
which would make good raw-material
for a novel. He desired his friends to
pledge themselves to reassemble on a
certain Sunday in 1930 on the railway
station at Basle. To what end? To
throw off the deadening bonds of adult-
hood and to start again their splendid
youth.
Brooke was twenty-eight when his
song was cut off, approaching the years
which young heroes dread. He might
have become an important poet, but
1930 would have offered him an unkind
rendezvous.

Man Behind the
Image
A Day in the Life of President Ken-
nedy. Jim Bishop. Heinemann. 17s.
‘TFhe President prefers a tub to a
-*■ shower. He bathes as he does every-
thing else: purposefully and forthrightly.
He treats time as though he has been
told he has a week to live. From the
first waking moment to the last, the
President moves at flank speed. He
comes out of the bathroom, bathed and
shaved and brushed, in a terry-cloth robe,
and he moves towards his breakfast tray
as though this too is a task to be
accomplished in stride.”
This passage of purposeful, forthright
and slightly breathless journalese was
written by Jim Bishop at a time when
President Kennedy did only have a few
weeks to live. Pierre Salinger was
giving the MSS a first reading, in Hono-
lulu, when the President was assassinated
in Dallas. Jim Bishop “asked to have
it published as it was written . . . when
the world was bright for him and the
future held the warm promise of good-
ness and victory.”
The little book of 111 pages is valu-
able, despite its author’s prose, because
it does give some insight on the man
behind the image, in its procession of
present-tense observations during a com-
posite day in the life of President Ken-
nedy. The President on whose mind
the world had to depend during the


Cuban crisis was also a husband, a parent,
a man with relatives, and a man whose
office and person had to be checked
daily with geiger counters, because of
a modern technique of killing political
figures with a minute amount of
uranium.
He is also a politician. In among the
discussions, meetings, Press conferences,
family moments, phone calls, there are
contacts —the book's present tense is
contagious—between the President and
members of his “team”, including Theo-
dore Sorensen, who writes his speeches.
“Sorensen and the President feel that
two terms is a short time for attaining
national goals . . . and devise hard-
hitting ‘shake-em-up’ speeches. Sorensen
can tailor-make the speech depending
on the group to whom the President will
address it.”
Bishop’s reportage does justice to its
subject, a day in the life of President
Kennedy. It is not a Life of President
Kennedy. Its analyses are a reporter’s,
off the cuff and on the surface, but no
doubt Bishop is a good reporter and his
observations were accurate. In his book
you can gain an impression of how the
Kennedy family lived. With pictures, it
would have made an interesting issue of
“Life” magazine.

Travelogue
A Passion in Rome. Morley Calla-
ghan. Mac Gibbon & Kee. 255.
Ttaly seems to occupy a special place
in the North American literary ima-
gination. The writers of the New World
have habitually gone to Paris to learn
about art and the life of the senses; to
Rome to learn about art and the life
of the spirit. Morley Callaghan’s new
novel, “A Passion in Rome” continues
an element in the pan-Atlantic relation-
ship which goes back at least to Haw-
thorne’s “The Marble Faun”.
Callaghan himself entered the world
of letters in the 19205, under the tutelage
of Ernest Hemingway. In 1923 both
men were on the editorial staff of the
Toronto “Star”. The already-published
American (“Three Stories and Ten
Poems”) urged the Canadian journalist
to commit himself full-time to serious
writing. Before long Callaghan followed
Hemingway back to Europe, met Fitz-
gerald and other expatriates, lived
through the experiences he later set
down in “That Summer in Paris”.
It is tempting to see some of the skills
of “A Passion in Rome” as having been
learnt all those years ago from the very
lips of the master. There is, for instance,
the same acute awareness of place that
Hemingway could infuse into all his
writing about Europe. Callaghan, too,
knows his Rome; the sense of a city
known as well as the back of one’s own
hand is one of the fundamental virtues
of his novel. There is further evidence
of a practised professionalism in the
management of dialogue, in the compo-
sition of individual scenes, in the adroit
transitions from scene to scene.
If Callaghan served his apprenticeship
to fiction in the 19205, he certainly does
not speak with the voice of any mustily-
sentimental past. “A Passion in Rome”
is as slick and up-to-the-minute as the
latest headline. It is the stuff of head-
lines, indeed, which provides the narra-
tive framework of the novel. Sam Ray-
mond, a news-photographer in his late
thirties, arrives in Rome to cover the
death of the Pope. On his first night
in the city he meets an extremely curious
young woman, Anna Connel. As the
months wear on —through the Pope’s
long illness, eventual death, and the
election of his successor —the affair be-
tween Sam and Anna runs its own tor-
tured course.
The affair, clearly enough, is intended
to have more than ordinary significance
for Sam, Anna, and the reader. Sam is
not only a news-photographer; he is
also a failed, frustrated painter, who at
the time of his assignment to Rome is
experiencing complete spiritual desola-
tion and collapse. One of his earliest
actions after arriving in the Eternal City
is to visit the Sistine Chapel, where
Michelangelo’s great paintings provide
him with both refreshment and challenge.
His situation is further complicated by
the illness and near death of his father,
an internationally-renowned “art” photo-
grapher.
Sam has his troubles; they pale
almost into invisibility alongside Anna’s.
A briefly-successful singer on American
television, when Sam first encounters
her she is masquerading as a Roman
prostitute under the name of Carla
Caneli. The irrational renunciation of
her American heritage in favor of what
she takes to be Italian civilisation is
only one manifestation of total psycho-
logical collapse. Anna is also given to
long bouts with the bottle; is involved
with a minor Italian film-maker; most
remarkable of all, retails all the scanda-
lous gossip of antique Rome with the
same slangy relish as if it were hot news
from the dolce vita. A good deal
(though not all) of this deranged be-
havior can be put down to the fact that,
as a child, she was raped by her adoptive
mother's brother—an incident which
stirs vague memories of Nicole Diver in
Fitzgerald's “Tender is the Night”.
Indeed, the relationship between Sam
and Anna bears a strong resemblance to
that between Dick Diver and Nicole in
Fitzgerald’s novel. Sam discerns
genuine talent and purity of spirit in
Anna. In seeking to restore her integrity
of being, he weakens his own grasp on
life. In the end, by restoring Anna to
health, he loses her; yet sees in Anna’s
new hold on reality a kind of tribute
to himself, a triumph for his own spirit.
A consistent pattern emerges from these
juxtapositions of theme and motif. The
ailing father, the death and election of
a pope, the search for personal salva-
tion, Michelangelo’s “Last Judgment”:
all these are apparently intended to lift
“A Passion in Rome” into a complex
investigation of the continuity of the
spiritual life, of personal rebirth and re-
generation. Unfortunately, the novel
cannot be said to achieve the end which
it seems to propose for itself.
The reason for its failure is plain
enough, and lies with the principal
characters. Underneath their contem-
porary trappings, Sam and Anna are
made up of little more than some of
the most over-used of our cultural
cliches and assumptions—those con-
cerned with the sentimentalisation of art
and the artist, suffering and talent. To
endow such figures as Sam Raymond
and Anna Connel with any kind of fic-
tional validity would have been a task
of considerable magnitude. To imagine,
to bring home, the special significance
that is posited for their relationship
seems to have been pretty much beyond
Morley Callaghan. To simulate signifi-
cance, he is driven back on to some
calculatedly “vibrant” prose and a good
deal of pseudo-profound dialogue. I
think it not unfair to offer the following
exchange as a characteristic example:
“My God, and I’m just a tourist.”
“Maybe everybody in the world is,
Sam,” she said thoughtfully.
“What?”
“Maybe here on earth we’re all just
a bunch of tourists.”
“You say the strangest things, Carla.”
When one can ignore such remarks
and simply respond to Sam as a news-
photographer and to Anna as a confused
and attractive girl, one can find in “A
Passion in Rome” the elements of a
well-observed account of a brief and
bitter-sweet liaison. On the side, the
novel offers the pleasure of some neatly-
etched minor characters and some color-
ful set-pieces. But since, overall, “A
Passion in Rome” is what it is, one can
all too easily imagine it being made into
a bad Hollywood film, of a special kind
of badness: the kind which combines
adult treatment, mature passion, and the
Technicolor joys of a Roman travelogue.

London Pride
The Old Man and Me. Elaine Dundy.
Gollancz. 225. 6d.
The White Father. Julian Mitchell.
Constable. 31s.
Oix years ago, Elaine Dundy’s first
novel, “The Dud Avocado” made a


sensational London debut, causing the
Press to break out in superlatives and
the publisher to lose his head with joy
and to admit it. Now, when everyone
had given it up, here at last is her second
book, and a worthy fascinating successor
it is, racily written in that type of
sparkling, pungent language which owes
something to both sides of the Atlantic.
It would be tempting to say that if
Elaine Dundy's first was about a young
woman who was in love and in Paris,
“The Old Man and Me” is about a
young woman who is in love and in
London. And in one sense it would be
true. But the “Me” of the new novel,
the American Betsy Lou who tells the
story is age-old in experience despite her
twenty years of youth, and whether she
is actually in love with the lecherous old
Englishman C. D. (“Seedy”) McKee or
simply with what he represents does not
emerge entirely clearly either for her
or for us.
Baldly, the plot concerns the girl’s pur-
suit of her own inheritance. Her late
stepmother has willed it to her second
husband, McKee. Only on the death of
this complete stranger will the residue
from Betsy Lou’s father's estate revert
to the meanwhile penniless Betsy Lou.
Laying her plans like a Borgia, she
arranges an accidental meeting with
“Seedy” on purpose, posing as Honey
Flood, her own best friend. McKee pro-
ceeds from ogling her in progressive
stages to pursuing her about London
like a rotund satyr pursuing a sprightly
nymph around a Greek vase. When she
allows herself to be caught, she steps
up the pace, dragging poor old CD with
her. She tells herself she is going to
kill him and means it, and does not
realise that it is not in her to succeed.
She tries hard enough, rushing him
from night-club to night-club, from
doctored coffee to too much drink to
drug-taking to near-murder. When
“Seedy” finally collapses, Betsy Lou
hysterically confesses all at what she
supposes is his death-bed and gains as
absolution CD's quiet counter-confession:
he has known who she was for quite
some time and had been a willing vic-
tim, ready to die a beautiful martyrdom
in the womb-like hell-holes of Soho.
By way of revenge, he recovers com-
pletely, both from his illness and from
Betsy Lou. He buys her off forcibly by
giving her half her fortune; and buys
himself off with the condition that she
must return to America at once and
leave him alone. His is the victory:
“Bland. Brand-new. As if none of it
had ever happened”, hiding suavely be-
hind an impenetrable wall, he packs her
back to the aridity of a New York apart-
ment and a terrible emptiness and
nothing to fill it with but all those dollars.
Diverting as it is, this is only the basic
blueprint on which Elaine Dundy builds
her real ideas. You do not have to be
an astute symbol-spotter to identify the
Old Man with England itself and the
Me with America, and if there are any
sceptics, the author puts an admission
into “Seedy’s” mouth in the last pages.
While most readers will accept a lusty
blonde as America, there are many who
even in this post-Profumo era will shy
at old fake Georgie Porgie McKee,
whose last hour of glory was during the
war, as the personification of England.
However, I submit that this is precisely
the reaction he is intended to arouse.
The dialogue becomes a battle between
the two points of view, the two uses of
language and of manners, underlining
what the Atlantic has done by dividing
the one Anglo-Saxon species into two.
It is a criticism of the English way of
life, breezy, astringent and good-
humored all in one. The country house-
parties at Lady “Something’s”, all the
rules of the mannered game of English
society (e.g., gossip must never be told
back to the person it is about, only to
someone else), the sham rituals of the
Antique Dealers’ Fair, the chilling well-
bred rudeness which English ladies cul-
tivate so exquisitely along with their
roses ... it is all fake, but a marvellous
artistic fake which must be admired for
the smoothness of its traditional facade
and for the ingenuity of its design.
too, by inference, comes off
even worse: everything is preformed,
prefabricated—the women, the families,
the apartments “tasteless in the real
sense, the food sense ... no flavor”, no
identity. Young Betsy Lou herself is
ruthlessly, refreshingly honest with a
lack of even any normal fantasy for pro-
tective self-deception. She looks at her
own image and is depressed by what she
sees and drugs herself in many ways so
as not to remember it. And in the end
she probably knows that she has really
grown to love bad old CD and bad old
England just because of their faults. Her
ultimate despair is caused by her final
banishment from them both and the
realisation that now she will never be
able to convince either of them that she
does love them and need them . . . not
in a month of English Sundays.
“The White Father” takes a related
theme, life in England to-day, but tells
it straight with a few obvious symbols,
if one excepts the bottle-top of a übiqui-
tous soft drink called “Free” as a re-
curring heraldic device for our civiliza-
tion. Its conclusions are both less terse
and less concise but, in their own way,
no less remarkable.
This England is seen through the eyes
of two men who feel strangers in their
own country: Hugh Shrieve, a middle-
aged district officer from Central Africa,
and Edward Gilchrist, a young Univer-
sity student.
Shrieve has just arrived back after
spending years being a White Father to
an almost extinct, anachronistic Stone
Age tribe, the Ngulus. He has come to
plead for protection for his minority
group after independence, otherwise they
will be literally swallowed up by their
hereditary tribal enemies. He is puzzled
at the polite indifference he meets, the
influential men who feel their role is
finished after adding their names, on a
roster basis, to mild letters of protest
to “The Times”. He finds that no one
seems to have a real sense of values or
a desire for involvement and his loyalty
and devotion to a cause have become
quaint old-fashioned virtues to be smiled
at politely and called obsessions behind
his back. He finally gets the assurances
he wants, not so much through normal
channels as through a brief meeting with
an African leader.
Edward Gilchrist, too, is looking for
a purpose and a sense of values in a
world his parents’ generation has suc-
ceeded in making into a thorough hash.
The only activity in which he finds any
satisfaction is playing cool jazz, but
even for this he has no true sense of
vocation. He is auditioned by the
Brachs agency but just misses out on a
contract. He takes a casual holiday
job helping Shrieve deliver letters and
gradually recognises in him at least one
man who has found complete fulfilment
through his selfless dedication to some-
thing he genuinely loves. Through
Shrieve he understands that life does still
have something of value to offer . . .
it is only harder to find.
Shrieve, in his turn, gains through
Edward a unique entry into the closed
secret society of the young. In one of
the most significant moments in the
book, his world and Edward's unexpect-
edly meet head-on in a club in Soho
where the youngsters are dancing the
latest craze, The Sway, and Shrieve
suddenly recognises in the stomping the
identical steps of the ritual rites of his
own tribe of Ngulus.
Looming in and out of the story is the
sinister figure of Mr Brachs, a kind of
master business mind who is shown to
intrude his many fingers into every com-
mercial pie in London. He it is who
tells people what they shall wear, what
they shall eat and how they shall spend
their leisure. Edward himself narrowly
escapes being made into another of those
teenage singing insects through a whim
of Brachs. This man is perhaps less
convincing than the rest of the book
but not so much because he appears an
exaggerated invention as because he is
probably far too true to life, where
anything is possible, to be readily
accepted in fiction, where not everything
is.

BUSINESS AND FINANCE
Imports on the Rise
Australia achieved a trading surplus of £197.5 million
for 1963-64—a big improvement on the £9.Bm. deficit
of the previous year. As warned previously by The
Bulletin, this apparent trading surplus will be wiped out by
invisible items. The final result still will represent a sharp
recovery from the current account £223m. deficit of 1962-63.
It is as well, though, to talk of the net figures instead of the
apparent surplus which invariably rates joyous headlines.
The year 1963-64 was a good year on which to look back,
but June import figures of £110.7m. —second highest for the
financial year—cast a sobering shadow. Industrial activity
is not only eating into the unemployment figures. It is also
nibbling away at Australia’s overseas reserves, as import re-
placement and general expenditure on imports (including
luxuries) bring a higher volume of goods to Australian
wharves.
Australia did well in the six months to March, 1964, when
the excess of exports over imports each month ranged between
£lsm. and £3lm., January being the only month when the
margin fell below £2om. In June, the margin of exports over
imports was only £5.3m., not counting those invisibles, which
would drag the apparent surplus into deficit.
There’s no question that Australia can afford a few imports.
Were not paupers and we've had a good season. The danger
exists, however, that the good season could encourage a sharp
lift in imports in a year when Australia might not be so for-
tunate with her exports. Import costs are rising and there is
steady agitation for freight and insurance increases.
The signs were apparent to Treasury officials some time
back; hence Government anxiety to increase the Australian
content of motor vehicles to 95
p.c., and so reduce reliance on
imports of automotive equip-
ment. Imports of vehicle parts
and accessories totalled £ll2m.
in 1962-63, jumping to an an-
nual rate of £l26m. in the six
months to December, with a
further lift since then. When
freight and insurance is added,
it becomes a major item.
Any wonder that some note
of caution should be sounded
when, after what has been a re-
markable season, Australia
ends up with a deficit on cur-
rent accounts? It’s not hard to
fathom if you look up the in-
visible items in the previous
year (1962-63) and discover that
Australia paid out £492m. for
such things as freight and insur-
ance (£157m.), travel (£45m.).

royalties and copyrights (£l6m.), interest on loans and invest-
ments, undistributed profits, etc., but got back in return only
£236m. in invisibles.
Timber Industry Still Struggling
Towards Rationalisation
oft-proclaimed goal of rationalising and reorganising
the Australian timber industry still looks very far off.
None of the bigger companies appears ready or willing, yet,
to begin the integrating task.
Certainly, the prevailing building boom keeps many sectors
of the industry happily at full stretch. But the boom also
serves to mask many areas of cross-purpose and inefficiency.
Two of the moderately-sized companies, though, have de-
cided to give a lead in the pursuit of greater efficiency. By
forming the jointly-owned Lumber Services Pty Ltd, Booth
Industries and Timber Investments are taking a worthy step
towards avoiding uneconomic processing.
Lumber Services will bring together hitherto separate re-
sawing, processing and importing operations. Best of all,
the joint company permits a much-needed plant modernisation.
Its new £120,000-£ 150,000 waterfront unit in Sydney is
planned to attain an early capacity of 25,000 super feet a
day. Lumber Services thus becomes one of the bigger Sydney
importers.
Most significantly, for an industry which is too widely
diffused and which has lagged technically, the new plant can
cope with work for outside timber merchants. Timber cut-
ting genuinely calls for economies of scale and up-to-date
equipment.
Meanwhile retarding divisions
within the industry are once
more being emphasised by two
opposing tariff requests now be-
fore the Department of
Customs.
One section of merchants has
requested the abolition of duties
on clear grades of imported
sawn timber used for joinery,
finishing and furniture. The
increased duties, principally on
Pacific maples, clear Oregon,
Californian redwood and
Canadian red cedar were im-
posed in January. They are
alleged, together with increased
supplier prices and higher
freights, already to have affect-
ed housing co^ts.
The Australian Timber Pro-
ducers’ Panel straightaway op-
posed the case for by-law ad-
mission of the above-named


timbers, claiming that vast quantities of imports would be
detrimental to the Australian industry.
Whatever the merits of these particular applications, it
should be remembered that the Tariff Board in January did
not see the hardships of the local timber industry coming
basically from import competition.
Indeed, the Board remarked that “regulation of timber
imports, according to estimates of demand, could destroy
competition and reduce initiative in timber promotion and
merchandising”. The house can be put in order from the
inside.
Putting Australia’s Overseas
Reserves to Work
While Australia enjoys its current high level of overseas
™ reserves, the Australia and New Zealand Bank Ltd
suggests that the money could be invested to better purpose.
The bank urges a relaxation of exchange controls so that the
funds could be put to work and help bolster Australia’s
earnings. At present, the available funds are invested in the
short-term money market in London.
There is something in the argument that, while funds remain
liquid, earn only small interest at short-term deposit and are
available to be drawn upon, there is always a threat of
inflation because such funds suddenly can be put into circula-
tion. If the funds are tied up and kept out of circulation —
by longer term fixed investment, plant investment, or portfolio
investment—they could earn a better return and sustain a
high level of overseas investment.
This argument has merits, but not everyone would like
the suggestion that a similar object could be achieved by
freezing the funds or imposing some tax penalty on them if
withdrawn.
There are long-term national advantages if, after having
built up overseas reserves, Australia nurtures them and helps
them to grow, thus bolstering the economy against inevitable
changes of fortune. After all, the more sophisticated nations
have developed overseas investment to a fine art, with a
careful eye on interest returns. Such an accretion to reserves
is equivalent to export income. The process involves a little
bit of restraint in overseas spending. It also means curbing
the urge to bring funds home and use them for local develop-
ment in opposition to overseas investors.
Undoubtedly, there could be some advantages if available
funds were invested for a higher return. Yet the first essential
remains one of curbing unnecessary spending on imports. It
is better to worry about excess liquidity in overseas reserves
than to see them frittered away.
Reserve Bank May Not Hurry
With Bill Market
HHhere is still a fair amount of mildly excited talk about the
A foundation of a commercial bills market in Australia.
Some well-informed and cautious financial sources, however,
believe it may be anything between six months and a year
before the Reserve Bank resolves to confer an official backing
to dealings in commercial paper.
Certainly the Reserve has kept silent (and is not to be
drawn) since the Treasurer empowered it to investigate possi-
bilities a few weeks ago. Applications from interested parties
have included syndicates of sharebrokers as well as the pre-
sently recognised short-term money market operators.
In The Bulletin last week “Croesus” suggested that a
crucial consideration would be estimates of the volume of
“fine” bills available for discounting. Any necessary testing
of this volume might initially be left to the nine authorised
money market dealers, who now give the impression of being
able to take commercial paper in their stride.
London requires only 12 discount houses to handle total
borrowings approaching fstglOOO million. Perhaps it would
also be signified that the Radcliffe Report on the British
monetary system remarked in 1959 that for these houses “the
business in commercial bills is vestigial”, their main hold-
ings comprising Treasury Bills and short-dated Government
bonds.
So a multiplication of facilities may not receive official
encouragement in Australia.
How far a bill market could be used to bite into the exist-
ing, unofficial system of inter-company borrowings must be
closely engaging the Reserve’s attention too. Interest rates
might conceivably become decisive here, though a reluctance
to substitute paper for direct money interchange will need to
be overcome as well.
One anticipated hindrance, a high stamp duty on bills
(fundamentally promissory notes), shouldn’t finally prove much
of an obstacle. The various stamp duties acts could, wholly
or partially, exempt those bills on which the Reserve Bank
was willing to furnish ‘‘lender of last resort” backing.
Shipping Freight Standstill
Could Be Brief
/Contrary to wide expectation, shipping freight rates from
Australia to UK-Continental ports are not to be raised
during the 1964-65 export season. The breather gives wel-
come relief to exporters who must be wondering how to cope
with threatened cost increases, notably those which may stem
from the recent basic-wage decision.
The pause, though, will most likely be quite short-lived.
It represents an extension of a two-year “standstill” agree-
ment between the Federal Exporters Oversea Transport Com-
mittee and the UK-Continental Shipping Companies, the latter
a “conference” group.
Perhaps an indication of future freight advances is conveyed
by imminent negotiations to take place among fruit exporters
and the shipping lines. These are to cover rates on “cartons,
pallets and unconventional packages” carried in the 1965
season.
In any case, a number of separate commodity freight agree-
ments formally expire over the next few months—wool on
August 31; general cargo, meat and dairy products on Septem-
ber 30; and fruit itself on January 31, 1965.
FEOTC and the conference propose to meet together to-
wards the end of this year to review the overall formula deter-
mining freight rates. Both parties apparently wish a thorough
re-examination. On current prospects an increase in rates
appears inevitable.
Actually, lacking the “standstill” arrangement, a one per
cent rise could have come into operation for 1964-65. That
was the suggested conclusion of the joint accountants’ investi-
gation into 1963 adjusted voyage results, to lift shipping com-
pany earnings up to formula level.
The increase in rates to Australia, effective from March 1
last, moderated the demand for higher charges on the reverse
route. Transporters’ continuing complaints about turn-round
times and cargo-handling costs suggest later pressure for freight
increases.
Freight discussions always bring to the forefront the role
of the “conferences”. The United Nations Trade and Develop-
ment Conference even went so far as to demand some kind
of international control of their operations. Between 250
and 300 different “conferences” are active in international
shipping, assuring profitable regularity of service and —pre-
venting rate wars!


ECONMICS ANONYMOUS
The 1963-64 Export Miracle
And the sun is still shining on us
A s the favorable trade balance has been
narrowing in recent months, it is
probably not quite proper to gloat over
the export miracle which took export
income up 30 p.c. to an unprecedented
£1383.9 million in the year just ended.
The achievement is nonetheless re-
markable for all that.
As the recent Government Economic
Survey noted, this unheard-of increase
in exports has been derived about fifty-
fifty from rises in volume and prices.
Prices, as we are painfully aware, can
just as easily go down for most of
Australia’s major export commodities.
Some markets, such as mainland China,
are perhaps a bit chancy. At least
the Survey thinks it safe to say that
“ground has been gained, particularly in
the volume of exports, which it should
be possible to hold, and further advance
over the next few years may be feasible”.
However, the survey is not too con-
fident in its optimism on the score of
volume. For, after drawing the con-
clusion that “output performance has
established a high current level of pro-
duction and export industries have de-
monstrated their capacity to step up pro-
duction as and when market opportuni-
ties occur”, it becomes hesitant lest this
be tempting providence. There is the
spectre of drought. Though drought is
“not as great a hazard as it used to be,
it could cause a withering and pro-
longed setback to rural industry”. It is
just as well to keep that in mind.
Some of last year’s increases in export
volume are impressive. Taking the
eleven months’ figures (details for the
full year are not yet available) wheat
was the star performer, 6.3 million tons
being exported in the eleven months as
against only 3.6 million in the same
period of 1962-63. The main increases
occurred in sales to mainland China and
the USSR. Between them these two
took more than half the total. While
China may take at least as much as last
year, sales to the Soviet this year are
unlikely to be nearly as big as last year’s
1.2 million tons, unless, of course,
Russian crops fail again. The only
other countries to import substantially
more Australian wheat were Britain
(674,621 tons) and Japan (472,947 tons).
Of the other important export com-
modities, the biggest volume increases
last year were in copper ore (from
214,627 to 2,907,904 cwt), coal (from
2.4 to 3.4 million tons), metals and metal
manufactures (from 7.7 to 11.5 million
cwt), beach sands (from 6.8 to 10.1
million cwt), wheaten flour (from 977 to
1219 million lb), butter (from 157.9 to
187.7 million lb), beef and veal (from
534 to 572 million lb), and cheese (from
54.5 to 60.3 million lb).
Some other volume increases were
substantial in terms of the bulk involved,
but not so much percentage-wise. For
instance, the quantity of wool exported
increased from 1313.3 to 1383.4 million
lb and sheepskins from 169.7 to 172.2
million lb. Again, exports of unwrought
lead rose from 2,980,587 to 3,289,251
cwt.
Against this list of volume increases
have to be weighed some important
exports whose volume was reduced last
year. Thus, exports of sugar for the
eleven months dropped from 1,100,484
to 1,053,719 tons, zinc ore from 5.1 to
4.2 million cwt and zinc metal from
1,811,648 to 1,631,315 cwt, mutton and
lamb from 184,096 to 180,691 million
lb, and sultanas from 107 to 100 mil-
lion lb.
JTlhe export miracle couldn’t have hap-
pened without prices rising for so
many of our export commodities, in-
cluding the most important of them.
Referring back to the Economic Survey,
the Government takes the view that, al-
though we have shared in a world-wide
change for the better in commodity
prices, we have also been among the
most fortunate, particularly in respect of
wool, sugar and minerals.
In fact, the Government states that
“after several years of decline, or stag-
nation at low levels, world prices of
primary products made a good recovery
during 1963. On the average of such
prices for the world as a whole, there
was an increase of about 10 p.c. over
the average of 1962. The rise has
continued in 1964 and, again taking an
average throughout the world, a level
appears to have been reached not much
below that of 1957, the year before the
general downturn in prices of primary
commodities began. Prices of sugar,
cocoa and wool have risen furthest but
various minerals have also shown con-
siderable increases. On the other hand,
the prices of some major commodities,
such as rubber and tea, have continued
to fall, while those of other commodities,
such as wheat and rice, have not
changed much”.
Apart from cereals (down 0.2 p.c.),
hides and tallow (down 0.08 p.c.), aver-
age index prices of our main export
commodities for the eleven months to
the end of May have all registered useful
and in one case, sugar, very substantial,
increases. Of course, these average
prices don’t reflect the peak levels and
except for sugar are not spectacular.
The main feature is that so many have
risen in the same year, ranging from a
rise of 75 p.c. in sugar, 16.8 wool, 13.4
metals and coal, 8.2 dried and canned
fruits, 6.2 dairy produce, and 4 p.c. for
meats —making an average increase of
14.1 p.c. for all commodities in the in-
dex over the eleven months.
Coupled with the general increase in
export volumes, these price movements
made the miracle, though being average
prices for the eleven months, they are no
guide to the current position. Indeed,
one finds that in the cases of sugar and
wool, the two commodities showing the
biggest increases in average prices for
the eleven months, they are grossly mis-
leading. For instance, wool has lost all
its gains made over the eleven months
and more, as the wool export prices
index for May, 1964, is 1.8 p.c. down
on the previous May. For sugar it is
only 29.7 p.c. higher than in May, 1963,
as against an average of 75 p.c. higher
over the eleven months.
If both wool and sugar have weak-
ened considerably, and this applies to a
lesser extent to dairy produce (up only
2.2 p.c. between the two Mays as against
an increase of 6.2 p.c. averaged over
eleven months), all other May to May
comparisons of prices in the index were
substantially more favorable than their
average increases over the eleven
months. Thus, taking May this year
against May last year, metals were 23.3
p.c. higher (the metals average over
eleven months was up only 13.4 p.c.),
hides and tallow were 16.2 p.c. higher
(average was down .8 p.c.), meats 13 p.c.
higher (average only up 4 p.c.), dried
and canned fruits 12.5 p.c. higher (aver-
age 8.2 p.c. up), and cereals up 3.8 p.c.
(average down 0.2 p.c.).
Because wool prices have slipped away
and this commodity bulks so large in
the export picture, one cannot say from
the strength of other commodity prices
that another miracle is in the making
this year. At least going on the export
figures for June, which at £ll6 million
were £22.7 million higher than in the
same month 1962-63, the sun is still
shining on us.


“CROESUS”
Mr Holt’s Public Works’ Harness
Maintaining some control on effective demand
Tt is all very well to jibe that “What
goes up cannot come down”, but
do critics seriously contend that the legi-
timate requirements for State public
works this year could conceivably have
been any less than the amount conceded
by the Commonwealth?
Surely it is unrealistic to call the
Federal Treasurer a softie who turned
the Loan Council meeting into a public
relations exercise because he gave the
States £7 million more loan money than
the £283 million he first intended. To
get this matter into perspective, thoughts
should go back to last year’s meeting,
when the States got £3 million more
than they asked for. This year they got
£46 million less than they asked for.
What is more, the Treasurer refused to
take the £1 basic wage rise into account
in the final allocation of £290 million.
Ask any of the Premiers. If Mr Holt
was engaged on a public relations exer-
cise to the neglect of the economic re-
quirements, it was a miserable failure.
The matter must be looked at in the
economic broad. The fact that the
£lB million increase in loan allocations
was in effect nearly equivalent to the
£2O million special allocation to stimu-
ate employment the States got in 1963-
64 is irrelevant. So, largely, is the fact
that the Federal Treasurer has come up
with a £27 million surplus against his
budgeted-for deficit of £58.4 million for
that year.
It is certainly right to argue that no
special assistance to the States to stimu-
late employment is necessary at the pre-
sent juncture. It was hardly necessary
last year, when only £9 million of the
£2O million special grant was spent on
works and the remainder was used by
the States for ordinary revenue pur-
poses. But this has nothing to do with
the States’ needs for public works ex-
penditure in the current year. These are
governed by the targets they have set
themselves for expansion of basic com-
munity services in a setting of accelera-
ted population growth. Maybe the
figure of £336 million the States put on
their needs for works and housing this
year was a bit more consciously inflated
than usual and they didn’t expect the
Commonwealth’s offer to get within sight
of it. Yet the Premiers have to be taken
seriously when they say that the alloca-
tion is insufficient to carry out as much
work as in 1963-64.
Again the flush cash position of the
Federal Treasury, shown in the achieve-
ment of a surplus of £27 million for
1963-64 against an estimated £58.4 mil-
lion deficit, is only obliquely relevant.
Admittedly it must be slightly embarras-
sing for the Treasurer to have to pinch
the States for loan money when Can-
berra’s revenue coffers are overflowing,
and when, this year, there would seem
to be good prospects of his getting pretty
nearly as good a loan response as last
year. Then, his expectations of around
£3OO million were bettered by £27.7
million (of which the States themselves
raised £IJ million, not included in the
estimate).
No, it was probably not any lack of
money which dictated the parsimonious
attitude of the Treasurer at the Loan
Council meetings. It was more likely
dictated by factors outside the favor-
able fiscal position and the good loan
prospects. The main considerations,
which are interdependent, seem to have
been fourfold.
One was certainly the shortage of
labor, which prohibits the effective
spending of more than a limited amount
of loan money. In arriving at a figure
for the limit the Treasurer has to take
into account not only the allocation to
the States, but also the Commonwealth’s
own capital expenditure and the level
being attempted by the private sector.
A second factor arises from this com-
plex of investment expenditure, to wit
the abundant evidence that private fixed
investment is mounting to a pitch which,
as the Treasurer stated recently, would
require some cutting back of fixed in-
vestment in the public sector to make
more room for it and thus obviate an
uneconomic scramble for available re-
sources, notably of labor.
A third reason for caution in loan
allocations to the States would be the
prospect of having to meet and pro-
vide resources to back substantially
higher outlays on defence. Provided
the Treasurer takes appropriate steps in
the taxation field, there should be little
difficulty in finding the necessary funds
involved in higher defence expenditure,
especially in a year when the natural
rise in revenue will benefit from rising
economic activity and perhaps a degree
of inflation.
Indeed, one would suppose that the
bulk of any increase in defence spend-
ing would initially be made overseas,
so that while counterpart funds would
have to be raised by the Government
here, the weight of the expenditure in
the first instance at any rate would fall
largely on overseas reserves, which at
present heights would be well able to
bear it, and only gradually make heavy
calls on local resources.
However, looking well into the cur-
rent year and if the extra defence effort
matches the hour, one would expect
local resources to feel a considerable
impact. With States having their head
in public works and housing expenditure,
this could well make a resounding and
most uneconomic clash.
given these prospective cir-
cumstances, the Treasurer was also
probably thinking of the effect of a high-
er allocation of loan money to the States
on the general level of effective demand
in the system. There seems to be room
for argument whether, £ for £, the
multiplying effect on incomes, and thus
on increasing effective demand, of in-
come generated through the expenditure
of loan money by the States is greater
than from other sources of income
generation.
Some of this money is of course spent
overseas on capital equipment, just as
in the case of outlays by other avenues
of investment. But a guess would be
that at present, when such a big propor-
tion of it is going into social investment
(schools, hospitals, etc.), roads and other
works where the local expenditure con-
tent is high (power, which accounts for
about 20 p.c., is the main exception to
this), increases in State loan expenditure
have a particularly strong effect in lift-
ing effective demand.
If this is correct, then the rise in the
basic wage would exacerbate the effect
on demand because, although the loan
allocation to the States doesn't take into
account the increase in the basic wage
(as with tax reimbursement no allow-
ance is to be made for the rise until
1965-66), the States will have to pay it
all the same.
Thus, although loan expenditure by
the States is probably no different in its
impact on effective demand than the
Federal Government’s own capital ex-
penditure, it is a source of supplement-
ing effective demand the Treasurer
would want to see in his own harness
and not bolting away under the whip of
the Premiers driving towards their own
targets. It must be presumed that the
Treasurer has the same sort of harness
ready to contain the pace of the Federal
Government’s own capital expenditure
this year, though one can never be cer-
tain about that.

Brewers Hit New Records
Catering for a necessary luxury
The well-known Australian thirst has
provided brewers with yet another
record year of production. There seems
to be no valid reason why this should
not continue.
Although final figures are not yet
available, the Commonwealth Statisti-
cian’s monthly production bulletin shows
that for the 11 months to May this
year brewers had produced more than
250 million gallons of beer. Even if
production for June, 1964, only remain-
ed at the same level as June, 1963,
when 15.5 million gallons were produc-
ed, it would mean that 265.5 million
gallons would have been brewed, break-
ing the previous year’s record of 256
million gallons by 8.5 million gallons.
The increased beer production has
meant higher output for the maltsters.
In 1960-61 they produced 9,164,000
bushels of malt. In 1962-63 their output
hit 10,488,000 bushels and for the first
ten months of 1963-64 9,863,000
bushels, foreshadowing a record year.
Brewers expect that the upward trend
in production will continue. One com-
pany, in fact, plans to expand its
capacity by one-sixth in the next 18
months.
While production has been increasing,
Australia’s consumption of beer per head
of population has shown a downward
trend. From the peak year of 1954-55,
when 24.3 gallons were consumed per
head, the figure has dropped to 22.7
gallons in 1962-63, the latest available.
The forthcoming Budget for 1964-65
is a talking point for brewers, since they
expect it to contain an increased excise
on beer. They say the effect it will
have, if raised, will depend on the size
of the increase but do not expect it to
have as marked an effect as increased
excise in March, 1956, had on produc-
tion for 1956-57.
In that year production dropped
26,768,000 gallons to 200,728,000 gal-
lons from 1955 - 56’s figure of
227,496,000 gallons.
Before Federation in 1901 each State
applied its own excise on beer. With
Federation came a Commonwealth duty
of 2d. a gallon or id. a 10-ounce glass.
Since then gradual increases have been
applied. The increase in 1956, which
drastically reduced production, raised
the excise from 7s. 2d. a gallon (5.37 d.
a 10-ounce glass) to 9s. lOd. a gallon
(7.38 d. a glass), where it remains today.
Beer prices over the bar are controlled
by the Australian Hotels Association
(formerly the ULVA). At present
Melbourne and Sydney over-the-bar
Prices are the lowest in Australia —a 10-
ounce glass sells for Is. 3d. The recent
price rise in NSW of id. a glass does not
seem to have affected brewers’ sales
since most drinkers left the id. on the bar.
Despite higher labor costs, increased
costs of distribution and higher-priced
raw materials, breweries in Australia
have been able, to a large degree, to
contain their costs. This, of course, has
reduced profit margins. It, therefore,
seems only a matter of time before the
price of beer is raised to meet this
situation.
The tight-lipped brewing industry will
say neither yea nor nay when asked
about a price rise, though it is known
that it is in favor. The chairman of
Tooth and Co. Ltd, Mr R. J. Vicars,
in his last annual address to share-
holders, pointed out that competition
from other hotels had made many hotels
uneconomic trading propositions.
NSW brewer, R. W. Miller
(Holdings) Ltd, in the report of its
half-yearly activities to December, 1963,
said net profit per gallon had been
adversely affected by increased wages
and distribution costs. “These increases
in costs over the past few years have
been partly offset by the last wholesale
price increase in 1960 and by improved
technology and other economies.
“It is difficult to forecast how these
rising costs can continue to be absorbed
other than by an adjustment in the price
of beer throughout the industry,” the
report said.
Millers echoed the feelings of all brew-
ers when it said: “In the hotel sector
the trade is constantly being faced with
increased assessments for rates and land
tax, continually increasing wages costs
and, for this year, a 20 p.c. increase in
licence fees. Unless prices are adjusted,
these ever-increasing charges can only
depress profitability.”
Australian brewers are not in favor
of bulk deliveries by tanker. Apart from
the high capital cost of scrapping the
present kegs, building stainless steel tan-
kers, buying prime movers and adapting
hotels to take bulk beer, brewers feel that
it is an unhygienic system of delivery.
One said Australian beer had a very low
bacteria content and that the present
system of bulk delivery used overseas
would affect this.
Another drawback of bulk deliveries
is the Beer Excise Act of 1901-1957.
It decrees that beer may be delivered
only between the hours of sunrise and
sunset. Consequently traffic already bad
in the cities would become even worse
if the roads had to carry huge tankers.

The swing from draught beer to pack-
aged beer (in cans and bottles) is becom-
ing bigger every year throughout Aus-
tralia. This is due, no doubt, to better
promotion and an increasing young
market. Several breweries have imple-
mented plans to increase their packag-
ing facilities. Tooth’s, for instance,
says it is now in a position to meet any
demands for packaged beer. It opened
a second canning plant during its 1963-
64 year.
Popularity of canned beer is evinced
by Swan Brewery Ltd, of Western Aus-
tralia, which now produces 100,000
cans of beer a day, although its canning
plant was not opened until April, 1962.
Swan, which exports 1000 gallons a day
(5 p.c. of its annual production of 20
million gallons), made a record profit in
the year to March 31 of £749,000.
Most Australian brewers have record-
ed excellent profits for their latest finan-
cial years. South Australian Brewing
Co. Ltd turned in a record profit of
£601,000 for the year to February 29
compared with the previous result of
£534,000. S.A. Brewing is the sole
manufacturer and distributor of draught
beer in South Australia. It also has the
right to brew and distribute Guinness
products throughout Australia.
Victoria’s Carlton and United Brew-
eries, of which Ballarat Brewing, Carlton
Castlemaine, Cohn Bros, Foster, Mel-
bourne Co-op. and Shamrock are hold-
ing companies, reports a satisfactory in.
crease in sales for the six months to
December. Its annual report is not
expected until October.
In NSW the R. W. Miller group as
a whole (the company is a brewer, hotel-
owner, coal-owner and transporter and,
lately, oil-shipper) reports better sales
for the half-year to December 31. Tooth
and Co. Ltd disclosed a profit of
£2,289,437 for the year to March 31
compared with the previous year’s result
of £1,911,231. Tooheys is expected to
report increased profits.
It is unlikely that Australians will ever
drink beer brewed in Australia by a
foreign-owned company. Charringtons,
the UK brewer which tried to break into
the Victorian market by buying Rich-
mond Brewery, was smartly rebuffed by
Carlton and United who bought Rich-
mond before Charringtons had a chance
to really get stuck into negotiations. It
seems probable that brewers in other
States would strongly resist takeover
offers from abroad, although one obser-
ver has pointed out that the report of the
Liquor Commission in Victoria could
change thinking in that State.
Unless the next Budget contains a
steep increase in beer excise, brewers
should contnue to turn in good profit
stories. To Australians, beer is a neces-
sary luxury.

Keeping the market on its toes
Tf nothing else, the threat of a takeover
(or the unending rumors) keeps the
industrial share market on its toes. With-
out such spice, it would be dull, routine
investment. There has been plenty to
keep the market guessing lately and
turnovers have risen sharply.
The mining market also has become
more active and the two oil strikes an-
nounced last week are a double dose of
what the speculators hope for.
Where were some red faces when
A British Tobacco shelled out for
Shelley’s Drinks Ltd. There had been
rumors in previous weeks about a pos-
sible takeover of Marchant in Melbourne,
but no one suggested British Tobacco as
a likely bidder.
Jaws dropped when the well-kept sec-
ret came out and British Tobacco burped
that it was a 15 p.c. holder of Shelley’s.
Even so, it was hard to justify the
remarkably high price of 355. paid to
the Shelley family for their shares.
But one thought remains. The mar-
ket for Shelley’s shares will be very
tight after the public sells 75 p.c. of its
holdings back to the Shelley family.
There is no doubt that the price of the
ss. shares could remain very high, thus
giving British Tobacco a wonderful
takeover weapon if it wants sweets, soft
drinks or other diversification.
A round the current market price of
41s. 6d., which yields 6 p.c. from
the 12i p.c. dividend rate, the 20s.
shares of Thompsons (Castlemaine) offer
handsome returns and the prospect of
capital growth in the near future. The
price is historically low, following profit
setbacks in 1962-63, but some observers
are predicting a return to the 1962 15
p.c. dividend rate when the 1963-64 re-
sults are announced late in October.
Production has increased this year with
the ironing out of labor troubles which
hampered proceedings last year. The
resultant higher wage costs have been
absorbed or passed on to customers.
Current shortages of skilled labor have
been no worry, as the transfer of steel
foundry operations at Williamstown
(Vic.) to two new subsidiaries (which
have now accumulated a back-log of
orders) created some “surplus” staff, who
are now being fully utilised. October’s
results will undoubtedly reflect a year of
recovery.
HHhe experts who predicted that Union-
A Kern-AOG eventually would make
another strike were not always strong in
their convictions. Many of the profes-
sionals divested themselves of AOG
shares when the market drooped and
dropped and urghhh!
Now, with high gravity oil found in
a separate structure at Alton, the Union-
Kern-AOG group has achieved what
many shareholders were hopeful they
would a year ago.
But having seen AOG shares dip to
around 21 s. 6d., there are many who
welcomed the opportunity of getting out
when the market sparked up again.
Drilling success always seems to have
a sobering effect on speculators. Evi-
dently they prefer to anticipate in the
dark.
AOG now comes closer to being an
investment proposition—if sales of local
oil are maintained at profitable levels.

INVESTMENT SECTION
Newspapers Off the Beam
Robert Hutchinson results in perspective
reports which Melbourne’s daily
newspapers ran the consolidated
results of Robert Hutchinson for the
year to lune 30 were all somewhat off
the beam.
The figures released by this flour
miller, stock and poultry feed miller and
merchant were, in the first place, applic-
able as a consolidated result and not just
to the operating subsidiary.
The whole business was very, very
confusing. So The Bulletin rang the
company. With the assistance of the
secretary, Mr D. A. Roach, the figures
which had been confusing shareholders
and investors alike were brought into a
truer perspective.
Apparently the most misleading fea-
tures were headlines, which talked of
41 p.c. profit increases for the year.
This calculation was based on last year’s
result (before turning public) of £66,250
and that of the 1964 year, £93,583.
These two figures are completely incom-
parable.
One look at the prospectus shows that
the company estimated profit in 1963 at
£85,094 if it had been under public
status. This figure is arrived at after
adjustments for public company tax rates
and after adding back an interest saving
on some deposit money which would be
paid off with the proceeds of the public
issue.
So, comparing this more relevant
£85,094 with £93,583, the increase for
the year is more correctly just under 10
p.c., not 41 p.c.
The papers also mentioned an ordinary
earning rate on year-end capital of 21.7
p.c. This figure is not based on the
£93,583 but on £81,333 —the amount
left for ordinary shareholders after
deducting £12,250 for the preference
charges. This profit for ordinary shares
was not mentioned at all. It compares
with the £72,844 in 1963 (on a public
company basis) which equalled 20.5 p.c.
on capital in that year.
However, there are two reasons which
show that the company did better than
to lift earning rate by only .9 p.c. First,
1964’s 21.7 p.c. is based on year-end
capital, not average capital which is
more relevant. This figure would be
22 p.c. if calculated on an average basis
from the time the company turned public.
Secondly, the proceeds from the public
issue were not at hand until about six
months after the financial year had
started. This means that only a six-
months interest saving was made on those
deposits which were paid off.
In the current 1964-65 year, the re-
sult will be augmented by a 12 months’
interest saving—the company estimates
that it will be about £lO,OOO more than
in 1963-64.
The company will be obliged to create

records in 1965-66 and 1966-67 also if
earning rates are to be maintained. In
another two years, £250,000 of deferred
capital will become eligible to rank
equally, with the present £375,000 of
ordinary capital, for dividend payments.
However, even if these deferred shares
ranked equally now the earning rate
would still give a fairly adequate cover
for the prospectus-predicted 10 p.c.
dividend.
And whatever happens in the next
few years, shareholders can be assured
of being fully informed. Robert Hutch-
inson has established itself as one of the
most prompt and informative reporters
of progress on the Stock Exchange.
A Lick at Taubman’s Reserves
Tn February of this year, when Taub-
A mans Industries Ltd obtained share-
holders’ approval to double authorised
capital, directors gave more hints of
takeovers and even cash issues than
bonuses.
So the bonus just announced came
rather as a surprise, although it is only
in the relatively small ratio of one-for-
ten.
It will absorb just £234,607 of
the £931,479 share premium reserve
and take issued ordinary capital to
£2,580,678.
Bonus shares rank for dividend for
the second half of the current year to
December.
Only in the last two years have earn-
ings been anything to write home about
since the four-for-five issue at Is. pre-
mium in 1955-56. Last year’s earning
rate was 19.2 p.c. on capital.
Dividend rate was accelerated to
15 p.c. in 1962, showing the company’s
willingness to be more generous with
shareholders now that the period of
great capital expenditure is over.
There could be more handouts in the
nature of the current gesture if the paint
market continues buoyant, although
Taubmans will be anxious not to over-
capitalise.
A current purchase at 16s. sd. would
average down to 14s. 9d. after the bonus,
to return 5.1 p.c.
Long View on Martin Wells
promotion in financial circles
seems to be responsible for the high
price (245. 6d.) of the ss. shares of
Martin Wells Holdings Ltd.
A 2 p.c. yield and such a market
premium from a stock which achieved
public listing roughly eight months ago
must be almost unprecedented in Stock
Exchange annals.
The company is spending £45,000 to
increase its productive capacity by 50 p.c.
This expansion, and the interim report
of higher sales and profits, suggest that
the 1962-63 earning rate of 20.8 p.c.
will be well exceeded in the financial
year just completed..
As Australia’s largest maker of oph-
thalmic spectacle frames, Martin Wells
has stepped into overseas markets and
last year won the Hoover Merit Award
for export marketing.
Consent, and the Reverse
"Oecognition of the limitations of the
cigarette market has motivated
British Tobacco Co. (Aust.) Ltd in its
entry to the soft drinks field via Shel-
ley’s Drinks Ltd.
Strong local competition and the
threat of cancer to cigarette smokers
limit British Tobacco’s scope for growth
in its traditional field.
The price of 355. paid to the Shelley
family for their majority shareholding
in the company was a magnificent one
in relation to pre-negotiation levels of
around 16s. 9d. The £1.5 million cash
involved is a trifling sum for British
Tobacco, whose assets total about £5l
million.
Members of the public who were
allotted Shelley's shares at 6s. Bd. early
in 1963 participate in one of the biggest
bonanzas on the Australian stock mar-
ket, outside oils.

The Shelley family, which is offering
to acquire 75 p.c. of the public's hold-
ings for 355. cash, could end up with
more than 16 p.c. of Shelley's issued
capital of £348,875.
Pursuing a similar course of action,
British Tobacco offered 6d. a ss. share
for the £783,750 paid capital of Mar-
chant and Co. Ltd, the Melbourne soft
drink manufacturer.
Marchant directors have not taken the
offer seriously.
British Tobacco put a value of about
£2.5 million on the Shelley company
and only £78,375 on Marchants.
The tobacco company’s diversification
(either direct or indirect) now covers
printing and packaging (including a new
interest in Dodge Consolidated Industries
Ltd), bread baking and ten-pin bowling
equipment, vending machines and pas-
toral properties.
But its interests beyond cigarettes and
tobacco are still relatively minor.
Killing Strikes
Prolonged strikes at the Brisbane Can-
non Hill abattoir have been blamed
for the unprofitable trading of Ama-
graze Ltd in the year to June 30, 1964.
Directors will not know the extent of
the loss until final accounts have been
drawn up.
In 1962-63 profit fell some 34 p.c.
from the 1961-62 level of £107,246.
For the two years prior to that, in which
Amagraze has been publicly listed, losses
were also incurred.
Amagraze, a meat processing and ex-
porting company, discussed a merger
with Huttons Ltd in September, 1963,
but could come to no satisfactory agree-
ment on terms.
Maybe, now, Amagraze could be more
easily satisfied. Its ss. shares are now
Is. below par.
Why Wurcker Favors Nash
There seem to be two basic reasons
why the directors of Sydney's Max
Wurcker are recommending the take-
over offer from England's William Nash
rather than the theoretically higher bid
from Melbourne’s Ozapaper. First, be-
cause the Nash offer represents 38s. 6d.
cash for each share, whereas Ozapaper’s,
although higher, represents only 6s. cash
for each four shares plus nine Ozapaper
units.
Cash is usually better than shares,
especially in this case. Ozapaper’s move
would involve big increases in paid
capital on top of further increases which
will result from a new issue which
directors may make later this year.
This, although few integration problems
Would arise, could well mean reduced
earning rates and possibly reduced divi-
dends.
The Bulletin, July 18, 1964
Then again, if the strong Nash organ-
isation entered the Australian scene
through some other channel, Ozapaper
could be up against rather strong com-
petition. This factor cannot be dis-
regarded, especially as Nash is already
exporting some of its fine paper to
Australia.
But the second basic reason for the
recommendation probably carries even
more weight. Nash and Wurcker have
been linked before, mainly through
machinery which the former supplied
to the Australian company. Un-
doubtedly the directors of the two have
some personal connections —these, under
any circumstances, are hard to combat,
and rightly so.
Turning the Title
F'ohn Bros has finally turned the tide
which has been eroding its earning
rate in recent years. The company holds
shares in Carlton and United Breweries
and manufactures and distributes soft
drinks, cordials and tomato products
under its own name in Bendigo and
Swan Hill (Vic.). It also has interests
in Coca-Cola bottling factories at
Bendigo and Wangaratta.
In its latest year to April 30, earning
rate recovered from 12.1 p.c. to 13.6
p.c. This follows steady annual declines
from the 19 p.c. earned in 1960. The
change will be a welcome one for share-
holders who could see that their normal
12 p.c. dividend was in considerable
danger.
Last year, a £60,000 dividend was
received from CUB. However, due to
price cutting and bad weather the
company’s other operations reduced this
result to £58,114. This year’s result
seems to indicate that the non-brewery
interests are now under control and
producing profits. Perhaps a steady
growth will now be made toward the
buoyant levels of 1960.
A Birthday Gift, op More?
Shareholders in Draffin Everhot, the
Melbourne-based manufacturer of
hot-water services and slow combustion
heaters, will receive a bonus 21 p.c.
dividend on August 5 in celebration of
the company’s 40th year to March 31
last. This means they will collect a full
121 p.c., compared with 10 p.c. last
year and 8 p.c. in 1962.
The payout will be the highest ever
since public listing in the 1950-51 year.
The problem now is to decide whether
the new rate will be continued in 1964-
65 or prove to be nothing more than a
birthday gift. Earning rate for the year
rose from 23.4 p.c. to 27.8 p.c., so there
is every reason to assume that such a
well-covered payout would be main-
tained, even if earnings slipped back.
However, in the past few years the
directors have made sure that any dis-
tribution was covered at least twice by
earnings, so it is probable that the
maintenance of profits at the 1963-64
level will be the main criterion in de-
ciding the 1964-65 dividend. The in-
terim report, due early in December,
will be the most valuable indicator of
the group’s performance. Until then, we
can merely speculate on the future.
Performance is tied primarily to the
home-building industry. In last year’s
annual report, the chairman, Mr A. R.
Draffin, said positive steps should be
taken to bridge the deposit gap, particu-
larly to assist young people in building
a new home. This, of course, has been
attempted by the Federal Government
and, in addition, general prospects for
the home-building industry are still point-
ing up. So the company should go on
to new heights in the current year.
The extent of improvement will de-
pend on how well the group can absorb
extra costs from the basic wage rise and
changes in long-service leave conditions.
New problems will probably arise, too,
from the planned moves into gas and
electric cookers. All these fields are
extremely competitive. Costs were held
down in 1963-64. This year they must
rise and the extent of this rise will deter-
mine the extent, if any, of further im-
provements in profit.
Unfimctional
Holdings Ltd, which
floated in 1962, is not paying a final
ordinary dividend as profit for the year
to March 31 showed a severe reverse.
An interim payment of 6L p.c. had
maintained the 121 p.c. annual rate
established the year before.
Profit fell from £19,340 to £9606,
earning rate from 18.6 p.c. to 7.4 p.c.
The company carries on business in
NSW and Queensland in furniture manu-
facture, real estate and drive-in restaur-
ants.
The ss. shares sell for about 3s.
Good News, and Early
news travels fast, so Sydney en-
gineer Brooker Holdings Ltd
checked in early with its preliminary
profit results for the June year.
Profit recovered to pre-recession
levels. It rose from the 1962-63 figure
of £12,355 to £20,190 after providing
£12,698 for tax and £9716 for depre-
ciation.
Conversion of notes on November 1,
1963, increased capital by 50 p.c. to
£168,125, but the earning rate still rose

Bonus Prospects?
Annual result of Sydney Holden dis-
tributor, John A. Gilbert Holdings
Ltd, for the year to March 31, was up
to expectations and echoed the GM-H
prosperity for the year to December.
Net profit rose from £192,352 to a
record £212,869, a return of 40.8 p.c.
on capital. Dividend continues at 15
p.c. for the ninth year in succession.
An income return of 4.4 p.c. can be
obtained from a current purchase of the
ss. shares at 17s. 3d.
Under the terms of the convertible
note issue, John A. Gilbert will not make
a bonus before the end of this calendar
year.
Although the conversion of these
notes on December 31, raising paid or-
dinary capital to £612,188, will detract
from future earning rates, there will still
be plenty of scope for a bonus.
Abel Lemon’s Maiden Form
Burning in its first result since going
public, Abel Lemon Holdings Ltd
reported a profit to March of £67,378,
slightly lower than the previous year’s
£69,563.
Earning rate is 19.2 p.c., and the
forecast dividend rate of 10 p.c. is paid
in one lump.
The company is an importer and mer-
chant catering for iron and steel foun-
dries and everything to confectioners.
The ss. shares are at 10s. 3d., about
Is. below an earlier peak. They yield
4.9 p.c.
Geo. Lewis Attends to Liquidity
A dividend cut from 10 p.c. to 7 p.c.
by George Lewis Ltd, Sydney prin-
ter and cardboard box maker, is a hard
blow for shareholders, who, until 1962-
63, were accustomed to a 12i p.c. rate.
The company appears to be paying
belated attention to conservation of
funds for development.
Last year competitive pricing and
higher raw material costs reduced profit
in relation to capital from 15.9 p.c. to
12.4 p.c.
Directors now report improved pro-
fit and turnover for the half-year to
April 30.
The ss. shares last brought 6s. 3d. on
Sydney Exchange.

SPECULATOR’S DIARY
A Brace of Takeovers
British Tobacco on a prickly hunt
TVevelopments surrounding the take-
” over of RMC may have been un-
usual, but they almost pale against
British Tobacco’s moves into the take-
over field.
Shelleys is a relative newcomer to
the Stock Exchange. A parcel of 300,000
ss. shares was placed at 6s. sid. in
January, 1963. Some thought must have
been given to the placement price and in
view of the company’s record and future
prospects this must have been considered
fair. As is normal with established and
profitable companies, the shares came
on the market some shillings above the
placement price.
The profit of £68,700 for the first
listed year of operations was fractionally
above the adjusted profit for the previous
year. If we look at adjusted profits
since 1958, we find that profits have
been as high as £99,600 (1960) and as
low as £13,700 (1959). Ironing out
these fluctuations, average profit in the
last six years works out at £60,000.
Profits would appear to be on the up-
swing, yet the compound growth in
profit would certainly be no more than
10 p.c.
Should the earning rate rise by 10 p.c.
this year, then the rate would be 24.5
p.c. If, for argument’s sake, we were
in the same mood as British Tobacco
and paid 355. per share, the earnings
yield is a very low 3.5 p.c. Applying a
maximum growth rate of 10 p.c. it
would take three years before this yield
even caught up to Commonwealth bond
interest rate.
Going to the other extreme was the
6d. per share takeover offer of Marchants
when its shares were selling at 2s. on
the market. One would imagine that a
company is either worth buying or not
worth buying. This bid would seem to
indicate that British Tobacco directors
were most uncertain as to the worth of
the business at the beginning.
It’s understandable that a tobacco
company should attempt to diversify at
this stage. However, as history has
proved, it is more difficult to diversify
successfully than to expand within one’s
own organisation. I don’t think I’ll be
going long in British Tobacco this week.
Instead, I decided to concentrate my
funds on Ardlethan Tin. Only formed
hi 1963, the Ardlethan Tin open-cut
mine is just coming into full production.
Prospectus estimates showed an earning
f ate of 19.3 p.c. based on a world tin
price of £stgBso per ton. At the present
world price of over £stgl2oo, the
estimated earning rate would be close
to 50 p.c. Provided that the estimates
of the quality of the ore are correct,
it would now prove a very profitable
venture.
The present share price of 10s. 9d.
reflects the very hopeful outlook for
a mining company with virtually no
past record. Provided that nothing un-
foreseen happens, it should prove to be
a cheap entry.
Newly-listed companies seem to be
the theme this week. Thus it was that
I purchased 500 Smith and Miles at
21s. 3d. The prospectus for the place-
ment of 162,000 10s. shares was issued
in May. Following reconstruction, asset
backing was still 12s. per share and
this appeared to be conservatively stated.
Profits seem to be steadily going up
and should be a record this year. After
the earlier exercise on Shelleys, the earn-
ings yield of 10 p.c. appears abnormally
high.
Ardlethan Tin and Smith and Miles
took the place of Waugh & Josephson
and James Hardie in the portfolio. Both
these stocks had moved up in the general
rise. There could be some reaction
before the Budget and I’m quite happy
taking a combined profit of £Bl.
Transactions for the week were:
SOLD
200 James Hardie, 135/- .... £1333
400 Waugh & Josephson, 23/6 £462
BOUGHT
1000 Ardlethan Tin, 10/9 £552
500 Smith and Miles, 21/3 £543
This brings the account back to a
credit of £378. With a rise of over
£4OO, the week has been one of the
best for the portfolio. Stocks in the
30s. range led the way, followed by
last week’s acquisitions.

MUD Launches Into
Car Parks
IVtuTUAL Underwriting and Development Ltd, 75 p.c.-
owned by Fairway Holdings Pty, the family investment
company of Mr S. E. Leighton, has bobbed up in the news
again.
It has acquired 97 p.c. of the issued capital of a Melbourne
car-park company, 565 Lonsdale Development Co. Pty.
This operates a freehold multi-storey car-park for 390 cars,
and has a 75-year lease over a site on the corner of Russell
and Little Bourke Streets. MUD plans to develop the site as
a car-park for 632 cars, an office block of 28,000 square feet
and a restaurant theatre.
The cost of the project is estimated at £BOO,OOO and MUD
claims it has the best car-park site in Melbourne with a high
day and night potential.
Work will commence this month and should be completed
by October, 1965.
MUD has paid capital of £300,000. The ss. shares have
recovered to a few pence above par since the Leighton interests
purchased their holding for 3s. lid. cash in February.
Ardlethan Mine Opening
Boosts Shares
Cince the official opening of the Ardlethan Tin NL mine
on July 2, market price of the company’s ss. shares has
strengthened from 9s. 3d. to as high as 125., with some relapse
to 11s.
Enthusiasm seems mainly based on the upward move-
ment of tin prices on the London Metal Exchange.
For the last three years world consumption has exceeded
supply. The USA, which stockpiles tin for strategic reasons
because it has no domestic reserves of tin concentrates, has
been meeting the deficit. The world price therefore hinges
very heavily on American behavior.
On the other hand, deterioration of the political situation in
Malaysia, which accounts for approximately one-third of free
world production, could throw tin buyers into a panic.
When Ardlethan’s prospectus was issued in February, 1963,
for the issue of 2,820,000 ss. shares, financial estimates were
based on a tin price of £stgBso a ton.
Recent spot prices have been in the region of £stgl2ss.
Another assumption in prospectus estimates was that annual
production would be 250,000 tons of ore. Now that mining
operations are to be carried out six days a week instead of
five, output should be 300,000 tons.
The Aberfoyle group, which was responsible for the
redevelopment of the Ardlethan field, is the leading tin-
producing group in Australia, with other interests in Mount
Cleveland, in Tasmania, and Greenbushes, in W.A.
As tin is the major metal in which Australia is not self-
sufficient, and the Ardlethan mine will lift Australian pro-
duction by 22 p.c., both Ardlethan and Aberfoyle deserve
investors’ consideration.
Paton’s Beehive Yields
Less Profit
rVNE of Australia’s largest knitting-wool and yarn makers,
Patons and Baldwins (Aust.) Ltd, earned 7 p.c. lower
profit in the year to December, 1963.
Profit fell from £802,156 to £748,025 and was equal to
33.2 p.c. on paid capital of £2,250,000 and 11.5 p.c. on
shareholders’ funds.
The company is wholly-owned by Patons and Baldwins
Ltd, of the UK, which merged with the cotton-thread manu-
facturers J. and P. Coats in 1960.
No dividend will again be paid to the parent, all profit
being ploughed back for local expansion.
For instance, the Launceston factory is being expanded at
a cost of £340,000, continuing the programme whereby
Patons and Baldwins (Australia) Ltd has spent over £2.5
million on plant and buildings since 1957.
Timber Merchant Lifts
Dividend Rate
Tmproved trading conditions and the economies resulting
A from consolidation of operations at Glebe allowed D.
Hardy and Sons Ltd, Sydney timber and plywood merchant,
to raise its dividend rate.
Profit for the six months to April 30 was satisfactory.
Interim dividend is 3 p.c., indicating a 6 p.c. annual rate.
In the year to October 31, 1963, Hardy omitted the interim
dividend but paid a final 5 p.c.
A capital profit of almost £200,000 was made on the sale of
the Balmain yard during 1962-63. In consequence, Hardy
repaid its £75,000 5 p.c. preference capital, while holders of
the 20s. ordinary shares received a ss. return of capital.
The 15s. shares are now selling about Is. below par. They
could show some gentle improvement by next January, when
the 1963-64 results are known.

SECURITY ANALYSIS
Higher Dividend on the Way?
Chemical Materials 9 fairly steady growth
/"fcvER the last two years, Chemical
Materials Ltd does not seem to have
attracted much publicity. Prior to this
period, the company appeared to be
frequently in the news, firstly for the
ingenious shareholder benefits resulting
from the sale of Purr Pull Oil to
H. C. Sleigh; secondly for its takeovers
of Alderson Products, Chronol Indus-
trial Chemicals, Decol Detergents, Alex
Minter and finally Maclac; thirdly for its
prompt revelation of the problems in
Maclac; and fourthly for the disharmony
which arose when Mr Sanford left the
company.
The report of last February said
“. . . the directors are confident that
results for the full year to June, 1964,
will be significantly better than for the
last year”. The report of February,
1963, said, inter alia, “. . . the result for
the full year to June next should sub-
stantially exceed the £97,844 before tax
earned for the full year to June, 1962”.
While there is some difficulty in put-
ting some arithmetical connotation on
words like “significantly” and “substan-
tially,” it might be assumed from the
choice of words that the increase in net
profit before tax will not be as great in
1963-64 as it was in 1962-63. One
wonders whether the increase will be
significant enough to bring the earnings
(net profit after tax, less £359 preference
dividends) to the level of the 1955-56
year, when the bulk of the income came
from dividends on H. C. Sleigh shares.
If this could be done, then the share-
holders would certainly have most of
their cake and have eaten it, too, because
the bulk of the H. C. Sleigh shares have
been handed back to Chemical
Materials’ shareholders in proportion to
their holdings. However, this achieve-
ment would mean an increase in net
before tax of about 40 p.c. as compared
with an increase of 20 p.c. in the “sub-
stantial increase” year of 1962-63.
Over the next few years, a fairly
steady growth can be expected in pre-
tax earnings and the level of after-tax
earnings, which depend to some extent
on the rate at which the 1960-61 losses
of Maclac are absorbed. Increasing
sales and profits should arise in the fatty
acids and surface active agents fields.
To the outsider, the fact that the
various activities are widely separated in
the Sydney area seems an impediment
to growth in earnings through the cost
savings which are normally expected in
amalgamations. Factories are situated
at Northmead, Campsie, Granville and
Glebe. From the annual reports it would
seem Glebe acts as the centre and pro-
vides marketing and sales control as well
as management and administration. It
may well be that most products are
made against firm orders and it is also
likely that they do not form the major
proportion of total sales. In this event,
it is possible that the additional costs
of this geographical diversification may
be very small.
For those interested in history, the
original company was known as Smith
Wylie (Australia) Limited and was in-
corporated in Sydney in 1926. Accord-
ing to the Investment Service of the
Sydney Stock Exchange, this company
was formed “to carry on business as
underwriters, company promoters, mana-
gers and agents, and to undertake
financial undertakings of all kinds”.
From this it would seem that it might
have been a forerunner of a number of
companies formed approximately 30
years later with similar objectives. But
Smith Wylie (Australia) seems to have
had its genesis in New Zealand, since it
acquired nearly 96 p.c. of a company
known as Smith Wylie & Co. which then
had an agreement with NZ Perpetual
Forests to act as broker and sole mana-
ger up to the end of 1932. So far as
it is possible to gather from the same
source, Independent Oil Industries Ltd
(which handled “Purr Pull” motor spirit)
was the only venture of Smith Wylie
which survived the “Great Depression”.
A British company acquired an interest
in 1934. Twenty years later H. C.
Sleigh acquired the “oil” business and
left Purr Pull Industries Ltd (as the com-
pany was then named) with 740,000
H. C. Sleigh shares, £lOO,OOO in cash,
the oil terminal at Glebe Island, a wholly
owned subsidiary named Chemical
Materials Pty Ltd and a 50 p.c. interest
in Dussek Bros (Australia) Pty Ltd.
TjVoM this date, the company has gradu-
ally built up the present business.
The success of the venture can only be
judged satisfactorily from the end of the
1959-60 year, as it was in April, 1960,
that the final distribution of H. C. Sleigh
shares was made to the Chemical
Materials’ shareholders. The first year
(1960-61) produced the Maclac loss, so
the earnings for that year were perhaps
unduly depressed, but the recovery has
been quite dramatic in terms of per
share earnings (as our summary shows).
For those who may feel some con-
cern that the consolidated tax provision
of 1962-63 represented less than 32 p.c.
of the consolidated net profit before tax
the following may help to allay this con-
cern. Firstly, of the £115,943 of net
profit before tax, £4594 represented divi-
dends on H. C. Sleigh shares which
would not be subject to tax in the com-
pany’s hand. Secondly, the seven com-
panies in the group, which all seem to
have traded profitably in the 1962-63
year, would have paid tax at the lower
rate on £35,000 of the taxable profit.
Thirdly, it seems that some £46,000 was
spent on additions to “Plant, Cars, Fur-
niture, Fittings, Equipment, etc.”, some
of which would presumably have quali-
fied for the investment allowance.
Fourthly, the taxable profit of Maclac
could have been reduced by past losses.
Very roughly, it would seem that the
latter two factors mentioned may have
resulted in £11,000 of the total pre-tax
profit being free of tax. From this, one
would judge that no great advantage was
taken last year of past losses and it is
likely that they will be spread over the
seven-year period fairly evenly.
Through June and July, 1963, the
shares were rarely sold above 15s. but
the improved result announced in mid-
August seems to have taken the shares
up to 17s. 9d.
After this they declined until the end
of the calendar year but then rose
steadily until mid-March, when a peak
of 21s. 3d. was reached. On this price,
if we assume that per share earnings will
be up 15 p.c. in 1963-64, the price/
earnings ratio would be 14 and the im-
mediate dividend yield from a 15 p.c.
dividend would be 3.5 p.c. Unfor-
tunately we have no established pattern
of dividends in relation to earnings, yet
with a dividend covered twice and
“bonus potential” reserves exceeding the
issued capital by nearly 140 p.c. the
prospects of an increase in the dividend
payout must be regarded as good. At a
price of 19s. 9d. (current last sale at

BEHIND THE BALANCE SHEETS
Battling the Overseas Giants
Cottees ' profit margins suffer
As an Australian-owned company,
Cottees Ltd, the food and soft
drinks group, has found the competition
keen from companies under overseas
control. Profit margins have suffered.
Cottees’ directors make the point in
their annual report accompanying
accounts for the year to March 31,
1964, that these companies have the use
of considerable capital resources, which
their principals invest sometimes with-
out seeking an immediate profit return.
Margins have been pared to achieve
increased sales volume and maintain
business progress under the changed
marketing conditions.
[Overseas-owned companies, Kraft
Foods, Unilever, and Schweppes (which
is controlled by an overseas parent)
compete with Cottees.]
Cottees each year manages to top its
previous profit record, but the latest pro-
fit advance was much smaller than usual.
Result was £209,281 after tax of
£105,000 and depreciation of £119,643,
compared with the 1962-63 profit of
£202,673.
The company produces jams and fruit
spreads, jelly crystals, instant puddings,
peanut butter, packet soups, sultanas,
frozen vegetables, poultry, and frozen
concentrated orange juice and milk bar
flavorings. Foodstuffs represent 60 p.c.
of turnover.
The other 40 p.c. of turnover is from
soft drinks. In addition, Cottees soft
drinks are produced by about 84 fran-
chised bottlers throughout Australia and
New Guinea (with particularly heavy
representation in NSW and Queensland).
Directors declared that if these sales
of soft drinks and cordials bearing the
Cottees label were taken into account,
sales volume would approximate that
of Cottees’ foodstuffs.
A relatively minor proportion of
group sales is made in export markets.
An export division has recently been set
up to examine further prospects.
The frozen foods and convenience
foods section of the business is also to
be developed.
Cottees traces its origin as a company
to 1927 and the passionfruit industry.
The product range has been enlarged
over the years and factories set up in
Sydney, Melbourne, Brisbane, Adelaide,
Perth and Mildura (Dyasons). It has
583 acres of citrus orchard (400 acres of
freehold) at Kulnura, near Gosford
(NSW).
The Passiona Bottling companies in
Sydney and Brisbane were acquired in
1959 and Cottees Passiona (New
Guinea) became a wholly-owned sub-
sidiary. In August, 1961, Cahills Quick
Freezers Ltd was taken over for a cash
consideration.
A small food manufacturing company
was acquired after the latest balance
date, which will strengthen winter
trading.
Fixed assets increased over the year
by £150,904 gross. Otherwise the only
significant balance sheet change was the
transfer of a provision for stock fluctua-
tion, which was previously deducted
from stocks, to current liabilities, and
the decision that this should also cover
long-service leave.
Paid capital of £656,000, including
£25,000 in redeemable preference shares,
is supported by reserves of £1,154,000.
The company is not troubled by
liquidity problems. It has not made a
cash issue since 1955. In July, 1959,
shareholders received a one-for-two
bonus.
The advent of overseas giants to the
Australian food scene has taken much
of the opportunities for growth away
from the local independents.
Progress is now being made at much
greater cost, as demonstrated in Cottees’
latest returns. However, their growing
scarcity will maintain investment inter-
est in the Australian-owned food con-
cerns.
Only adventurous investors impatient
for quick capital growth would abandon
Cottees.

LONDON STORES LTD
Recovery Continues
Tn the year to February 29, the profit
A of London Stores Ltd continued to
recover toward the buoyant levels of
1959-60 and the dividend payout was
actually lifted to the same figure as in
that year. The various facets of the
company’s performance have been rather
clouded, however, by the fact that a
one-for-one bonus, coupled with a share
split, doubled ordinary capital last
November.
It is quite an occasion when this Mel-
bourne-based retailer of men’s and boys’
wear issues to shareholders. The previous
issue was a one-for-two bonus in 1950-
51. Since its inception in 1911 only
three other capital moves have been
made —in 1920, 1923 and 1925.
It will take some time for this sound
and steadily growing organisation to re-
build reserves and re-establish its earn-
ings to around the 25 p.c. level. Mean-
time, nothing can be expected apart
from a healthy yield from dividends
each year.
The soundness of the group, and the
conservative outlook and planning which
it undertakes, are well illustrated by the
activities carried on to this end during
1963-64. Two possible amalgamations
were discussed, but nothing came of
them. Sites for new stores were in-
spected at Sunshine, Shepparton, Nid-
drie, Ballarat and Colac. All were
deemed unworthy.
Finally, a site at Geelong was pur-
chased and trading should be under way
in 1965. Once this is achieved, a decent
boost should be given to group profits.
Meantime, a ray of hope has turned up
for the Prahran shop—the council and
the Flousing Commission have com-

bined to start work on a large housing
scheme. Construction has already begun
and some trade should be restored to the
area by the time the company’s Geelong
site is in operation.
The net effect of these two items
should be a rise in profit during the
1965-66 year to February 28, and an
even bigger jump in 1966-67. In the
current year, performance will depend
entirely on how well the barrage of
competition is met by the company.
It was obviously handled satisfactorily
in 1963-64 as the profit for ordinary
shareholders rose, in round figures, from
£62,000 to £67,000. This represented
another step in recovery to the 1959-60
figure of £76,000. The low of £55,000
was touched in 1961-62. However, as
ordinary capital was doubled in Novem-
ber, earnings on the average figure came
back from 20.7 to 15 p.c.
On year-end capital the figure was
11.1 p.c. So, in effect, earnings for the
year on the old capital were 22.2 p.c.
and the company cannot be criticised
for losing profitability as a bonus issue
involves no money raising but merely
book entries. This figure again rep-
resents recovery toward the 1959-60
figure of 25.3 p.c., from the 18.3 p.c.
low of 1961-62.
More important to shareholders’
pockets, however, was the dividend pay-
out which rose, although the actual per-
centage rate came back from 16i p.c.
to 8f p.c. On the old capital, this rate
would have equalled 171 p.c. — the
payout made in buoyant 1959-60.
So in reality 1963-64 was a bumper
year for the shareholders. They received
bigger dividend cheques. They received
a bonus and, when dividend rates rise
again as they undoubtedly will, the
cheque will grow even larger. In
addition their 20s. shares were split to
5s. units, so their holdings are much
easier to handle and a much more
active market can be created for their
scrip on the ’Change.
The balance sheet indicates that the
stage is set for further steady expansion
in line with the directors’ decisions on
diversification. Working capital is at
its highest since 1959-60.
Although the gradual growth in fixed
assets stopped, the Geelong centre will
take this figure to a new height in the
current year. (£1.3 million of the figure
comprises entirely freehold land and
buildings which have not been revalued
since 1956.)
Probably the most encouraging long-
term feature of all is the fact that,
despite the bonus issue, reserves at
£871,000 are still far in excess of paid
ordinary capital at £600,000.
In summary, then, at the current price
of 9s., London Stores scrip offers an
attractive dividend yield of 4.9 p.c.
which will undoubtedly rise in 1965-66,
if not this year, and it should rise even
further through the long term as share-
holders await the next capital move.

geo. FIELDER AND CO. LTD
Decline in Last Five Years
Tamworth flour miller Geo. Fielder
and Co. Ltd had mildly comforting
news for shareholders in the interim
report on trading for the six months to
March.
Profit of £58,569 was about 4 p.e.
ahead of £56,161 earned in the first half
of 1962-63. Last year’s 8 p.c. annual
dividend rate, which was only just
covered by earnings, has been continued
with an interim 4 p.c.
Geo. Fielder is at least holding ground.
Once considered an excellent second
rank stock which paid regular dividends
of 12i p.c., it has had its ups and downs
in the last five years, and investors may
not again enjoy the same confidence in
the stock.
The year 1958-59 brought a severely
reduced profit because the NSW wheat
crop failed and the company had to im«-
port from other States. Moreover, Tam-
worth operations were being reorganised,
and there was an unexpected demand for
special starch products before the auto-
matic processing was completed.
The company encountered further
difficulties in 1960-61 in the integration
of companies acquired, and unsatisfac-
tory trading conditions in the stock feeds,
gluten and glucoce industries.
Geo. Fielder has traded profitably
throughout, but the dividend paid has
fluctuated between 10 p.c. and 3 p.c.
over the last five years, and reserves had
to be drawn on in 1958-59 to pay 8 p.c.
Profit from trading in 1962-63 was
£98,677 (including investment income
£45,473) after providing £36,737 for tax
and £150,916 for depreciation. Reserves
were augmented by £234,731 profit on
the sale of fixed assets.
The business dates back to 1907 when
flour-milling was begun in Tamworth.
Wheat Industries Pty was formed in 1938
to process cornflour, gluten, starch and
other by-products extracted from flour.
During 1962-63 capital was increased
by the issue of 225,000 5s. shares to buy
the outside interests in Starch Sugars,
and of 423,184 shares as part considera-
tion for 7 p.c. convertible notes. These
notes were convertible half in cash and
half in shares.
There are still £279,996 of 8 p.c. notes
which convert fully to ordinary shares
at par on May 31, 1965. Other loan
capital at last balance date, September
30, 1963, was £239,132 repayable within
the next year.
As export flour markets have shrunk,
Geo. Fielder has joined the scramble for
bakeries and other means of diversifica-
tion. The competition is keen and pro-
fit margins on bread are.small.
In view of the company’s decline in
fortune in the last five years, it would
be a brave investor who bought a big
holding of Fielder shares at the present
price of around 6s. (income yield
6.7 p.c., earnings yield a shade higher),
but those who are already in this stock
might hope for some mild price improve-
ment.

BENEFICIAL FINANCE CORPORATION LTD
A Bank-backed Future
VTow that the National Commercial
Bank of Scotland has taken out a
25 p.c. share interest in Adelaide-based
Beneficial Finance Corporation (see The
Bulletin, May 16, p. 62) the future
undoubtedly holds great prospects for
growth and benefits for shareholders. If
the growth can be anything like that so
far then it will certainly be outstanding.
Since balance date, March 31, 1961
(the company was listed in February,
1961), fixed assets have grown fourfold,
ordinary capital has done even better
than this, reserves have been multiplied
nearly 40 times and net profit has in-
creased from around £14,000 to just on
£96,000. Admittedly, this record was
aided in that it came from very small
beginnings.
Beneficial’s main activities have been
in financing for first and second mort-
gages and also for home improvements.
This type of business has a compara-
tively low loss ratio. Hire purchase is
also an important activity, though the
company has steered clear of motor
finance in the main.
So the directors’ policy has obviously
been one of conservatism. This is fur-
ther evidenced by the borrowings, which
have been kept in the long-dated cur-
rency field. The bank-backing will now
enable Beneficial to enter into the
shorter-termed field, however, where the
cost of borrowing is cheaper, and also
to reduce borrowing rates at a time when
they are generally rising throughout the
rest of the economy.
On July 3, a new £300,000 debenture
issue was announced, with reduced in-
terest rates. As with most finance com-
panies, the raisings will be available to
pay off any maturing debts, yet it is
notable, in this case, that funds from the
issue “will be used to finance the bud-
geted expansion of the company’s acti-
vities” as well.
At present, subsidiaries are operating
in NSW (five), Victoria (three) and WA

(one). As a group, these and the hold-
ing company in Adelaide should see
substantial benefits from the bank link
apart from those already mentioned. The
most obvious, of course, is the increased
market status which the scrip must en-
joy.
The new connections which will be
available through the link, and the
immense amount of expert financial
knowledge which Beneficial must now
have some access to, cannot be sniffed
at either. The bank is the biggest in
Scotland and was the first in the UK to
enter the hire-purchase field. In addi-
tion, it owns half of Lloyd and Scottish
Ltd, the second largest finance group in
the UK.
As the gains from this link will be
small for a year or two in comparison
to their full effect once the connection
has matured, shareholders should not be
too disappointed if the current year’s
result sees no improvement in the earn-
ing rate. Mediocre earning rates have
been the main criticism of the company,
and the limiting factor on share prices,
ever since listing. This, however, is the
price of expansion through ordinary
share issues.
If an investment for more than one or
two years is being considered, then cur-
rent prices should prove to be “bar-
gain” buys. Once the bank link gets
into full swing, the benefits will be enor-
mous. As it is, The Bulletin has been
told there are no problems in employing
the extra capital immediately.
In the meantime, the company will
undoubtedly keep shareholders in mind.
Already, in its listed history of three and
a half years, three par issues have been
made at two-for-five, one-for-four, and
one-for-five.
The general solidity of the company is
evidenced by the fact that more than
40 p.c. of the issued capital is in insti-
tutional hands. The SA Farmers’ Co-
operative Union and the MLC hold
share interests as well as the Scottish
bank.

THE MAN
ON THE LAND
“Pies” and “Get-Togethers”
Arguments for and against them
The word “pie”, which is used to de-
scribe a grouping of buyers, is very
old and is probably not slang.
A pie to be eaten is a mixture enclosed
in pastry. A piebald horse is one of
several colors. A magpie is a bird of
different colors.
Pie, therefore, quite aptly describes a
group of buyers operating as one.
At just about every meeting of farm-
ers, from the branch level up to the
national convention, somebody has
something to say about buyers’ pies.
They operate at livestock auctions mostly,
and sometimes at wool auctions.
The language some farmers have used
to describe these goings on (or alleged
goings on) is sometimes just a little too
colorful. Instead of being taken seri-
ously, the farmer sounding off about pies
is likely to be termed a headline hunter.
Here is an example taken from a re-
cent national meeting of a farmers’
organisation. One speaker said: “You
see them (buyers) giving each other the
wink, getting their heads together, and
cheating the farmer who is only trying
to make a living. They manipulate the
market as they please. The pie is mon-
strous and it stinks.”
llThen motions resulting from such
" allegations are passed and sent on
to this Minister or that, the language is
broken down, of course. But nothing
much ever happens.
One might reasonably assume that as
long as there are auctions there will be
pies. The farmer can always sell in an-
other market. And it should follow that
the bigger the market the less chance of
buyers depressing prices by organised
bidding.
It stands to reason that all the buy-
ers could not work together all the time.
If they did they would put each other
out of business.
But this is merely one point of view
and should not necessarily be taken any
more seriously than the farmer orator
who claims the “monstrous pie” is every-
where.
The buyers usually dismiss such allega-
tions as nonsense.
Therefore, it comes as a shock, and
a pleasant one, to discover one of the
biggest buyers in the meat business hav-
ing quite a lot to say about pies.
Actually they don’t use the word but
refer instead to “get-togethers”. They
are one and the same thing.
The buyer is Thomas Borthwick and
Sons Ltd and the mention of “get-to-
gethers” comes in a handsome volume
entitled “A Century in the Meat Trade”.
It is not for general sale.
book traces the beginnings of the
A business (one shop in Liverpool in
1863), the trials and travails along the
way (failure in the Argentine), and the
growth to the present huge undertaking.
In Australia the company kills four
million sheep and 140,000 cattle a year;
in New Zealand, 2i million sheep and
135,000 cattle; and in the UK there are
33 wholesale branches.
In Australia it owns six meatworks
and five cattle stations. In New Zealand
it has five meatworks and killing arrange-
ments at nine others.
An American branch of the company
was set up in 1960 to handle much of
the boneless beef and mutton imports to
USA from Australia and New Zealand.
The really interesting part of the book,
however, is the chapter devoted to
“Points of View”. Some extracts follow.
“Until very recently the directors have
felt that, theirs being a private company,
the way it was run, and the reasons why
they thought this was the right way to
run it, were their own affair. But in re-
cent years these matters have been at-
tracting more and more public interest.
“Statements have been made by poli-
ticians, in the Press, and elsewhere that
seemed to call for an answer; and some
of the things that were said were not in
accordance with the facts. So Borth-
wicks felt for the first time the need to
explain the facts, and themselves, to the
world.
“It (the meat trade) is in general an
affair of small units. There are, of
course, some very big farmers and some
companies owning chains of retail shops.
But these are exceptions.
“You can be an exporter without own-
ing a freezing works because you can
have your stock killed at someone else’s
works.
“The effect of this is that in the meat
trade the ordinary healthy forces of
supply and demand really work. If a
farmer does not like the price one buyer
offers he can go to another buyer. If
he cannot get the price he wants from
any buyer he probably has a false idea
of the ‘right’ price.
“The price may be lower than usual
one year; but with free competition
working all along the line it is fairly cer-
tain that this will be a reflection of
economic conditions which no one can
help.
“If the market is being unfairly con-
trolled by some kind of ‘get-together’
that is another matter.
“But ‘get-togethers’ have never lasted
long in the meat trade. Borthwicks have,
in any case, as a matter of principle,
always refused to have anything to do
with them if they mean agreements on
either buying or selling prices.
“True, the market may be sometimes
over-sensitive. Prices may go up or
down more than is reasonable in re-
sponse to prospects of good or bad
weather, strikes, revolutions, wars, finan-
cial crises and so on. Here individual
firms who know their business can do
much to cushion the effects of undue
optimism or pessimism by taking a
longer view.
“Tf anyone thinks that farmers, or deal-
A ers, or exporters or butchers are
making excessive profits, he can, at least
with a few supporters, start up in com-
petition himself.
“Further, a farmer can dispose of his
stock in various ways. There is com-
petition not only between different firms
but between different methods.
“Meat production, processing and
marketing are carried on by individuals
and concerns, some of whom are fairly
large, but most of them small, all in com-
petition with each other.
“Their numbers are big enough to
ensure that the forces of supply and de-
mand really work, and that anyone who
tries to make an excessive profit, or
cannot make a reasonable profit at the
prices established on a free market, will
soon be out of business.
“Governments, the watchdogs of the
people’s rights, can intervene to check
abuses and to ensure that conditions are
favorable to free and honest working.
“If they try to do more than that they
are interfering with a sensitive mechan-
ism, a living mechanism, that has grown
up in response to living needs, and
answers those needs remarkably well.
Such interference, except, of course, in
times of national emergency, will prob-
ably do more harm than good.
“Whatever may be said of other trades,
the meat trade is one —perhaps the one
above others —in which free competition


allows the laws of supply and demand
to work. Monopoly is impossible.”
What is the alternative?
In all fairness it needs to be stated that
Government intervention, such as we had
in the war, with coupons and a black-
market, is not the only alternative.
For 12 years France has had a “target
price” system for all meat. And, from
all reports, it works well.
A controlling authority sets a price
(the target) for every grade of meat.
Intervention prices are set 8 p.c. below
and 8 p.c. above each target outside
which trading is not allowed. This is
for meat. Livestock prices adjust ac-
cordingly.
The controlling authority takes over
the storing of all meat which fails to
reach the bottom intervention price and
feeds this stored meat back as soon as
the price reaches the target for the grade
concerned.
Farmers do not have to accept un-
reasonably low prices; but by the same
token buyers do not have to pay un-
reasonably high prices.
Whether Australian farmers would
settle for such a system is open to debate.
Protection from low prices is one thing.
Denial of high prices is another. Also
the French are mainly concerned with
a home market—not exports.
But one thing is sure —most Australian
farmers would favor selling by weight
and not by the hoof.
Why this country is so far behind in
this matter remains a mystery. “On the
hoof” in the US went out with the
Longhorns. Many buyers have declared
that they would be in favor of weight
selling. These days even the most ex-
pert buyer with an eye for a beast is
hard put to accurately gauge the weight
of an animal on the hoof. There are
so many more breeds, semi-breeds,
types and animals from different types
of pasture than there were 50 years ago.
Scales would be a relatively cheap
installation at saleyards. Professional
skill would still have its place. The
buyer would still have to ascertain the
proportion of fat, lean and bone contri-
buting to the liveweight of the beast.
Test for Dried Fruits Pact
Prices set " dangerously high "
Tt is less than two years since Turkey
-*■ started a flurry of undercutting that
took prices for Australian dried fruits in
the United Kingdom to the lowest ebb
they had seen since the slump of 1954.
Now Turkey and Greece, bound by a
three-way pact with Australia, have
caused prices for the coming season to
be set at a level thought in some quarters
to be dangerously high.
The agreement under which the figures
have just been announced was reached
to prevent a recurrence of the price-cut-
ting that dogged the Australian industry
in 1962 and which contributed to the
conditions on which the industry based
its case for the stabilisation plan that was
accepted by the Commonwealth Govern-
ment last year and by a poll of Austra-
lian growers last March.
It was said that some growers were
making less than £5 a week; that most
were under lien to packing companies
and were being given dockets to show
that their payments had been deducted
from their debts.
The stabilisation scheme, of the give-
or-take variety, will serve as a safeguard
against extreme privations, but will still
allow growers to receive £5 a ton less
than cost of production before entitling
them to compensation. The plan can
stabilise, but only within the context of
world prices, and it was about them
that something had to be done.
The answer was the three-way pact
reached last year between Australia,
Turkey and Greece.
The agreement provides for the set-
ting of prices by negotiation between
the partners at the start of each season,
and they can be revised within the sea-
son if the situation warrants.
This year’s values have been based on
Mediterranean rates equal to about £147
Australian for four-crown sultanas and
£l5O for five-crown—which means sell-
ing prices in the United Kingdom of
about £l7O a ton for four-crown and
£175 for five-crown, ex warehouse.
By comparison, the main grade of
Australian sultanas in 1962 was bring-
ing just over £lOO a ton.
On the face of it, prices fixed at this
level suggest fat rewards for growers
recently haunted by thoughts of penury;
but while fixing may have solved the
problem of price it has only aggravated
that of disposal.
Despite the growth of world popula-
tion, demand for dried fruits is declining
as people turn from sweet to savory
foods.
In an attempt to reverse the trend,
the Australian dried fruits industry, in
collaboration with Australian Govern-
ment trade promotion authorities in Lon-
don, has recently spent record sums on
pushing its wares in Britain, which takes
most of the 80 p.c. or more of its dried
fruit production that Australia exports.
This spending last year exceeded
£70,000, compared with nothing at all
just after World War 11.
Australian officials in Britain have ex-
pressed concern that the first lot of prices
to be set under the new three-nation pact
Is so high that it might undo much of
the good that has come from this pro-
motion.
Having been dissuaded from bleeding
each other, Australia’s Mediterranean
pact partners seem bent on using the
new solidarity to bleed the market itself.
The danger is that the veins may run
dry.
The Australian negotiators wanted
prices to be considerably lower than
those set, and would have preferred a
minimum price constituted under a
simple agreement rather than one sub-
ject to constant adjustment. In putting
prices too high, they say, there is a risk
that what is intended as a minimum price
will be accepted by the trade as a maxi-
mum.
In asserting their majority will to de-
feat the Australian case for moderation,
Turkey and Greece no doubt felt justi-
fied by the fact that world production
of dried fruits this year is considerably
down —a fact from which Australia,
with its all-time record crop of 82,000
tons of sultanas, can draw some con-
solation. What worries the moderates is
that when production rises again, de-
mand may not rise with it.
Worrying as the new pact prices might
be, if Australia’s dried fruits industry
must accept extremes, the odds are much
more in favor of success at the top of
the price ladder than the bottom.
In addition to wage levels that set her
economic waterline much higher than
that of the Turks or Greeks, Australia’s
dried fruits are acknowledged to be so
superior that in any luxury class com-
petition her produce would be the last
to go under.
It is recognised that the success of
the Greco-Turkish-Australian pact will
depend on whether the signatories can
refrain from being too greedy and put-
ting stresses on it by trying to use it for
national benefits at the expense of col-
lective ones.
Already there are some doubts as to
whether these rules are being observed.
For Australian producers, failure
could mean an early dependence on the
Federal Government for funds to prop
up the stabilisation plan—a wrong-foot
start that would depress the morale of an
industry already bruised by reverses and
proud enough to repudiate any sugges-
tion of a likeness between its stabilisation
scheme and a subsidy.
For the Greeks and Turks, failure of
the pact could mean the creation of yet
another area in which the two nations
do not quite hit it off.
Which way the verdict will go should
become clear before the year is over.

Difficult Times Ahead?
Analysis of world wheat markets
Australian wheatgrowers, riding high
wide and handsome in the last
couple of seasons, may have more diffi-
cult times ahead. There is news that
Russia has bought considerable quan-
tities from Argentina for 1965 delivery
and the US is likely to have big sur-
pluses again.
US wheat farmers are reported to be
unhappy about the emergence of the
Argentine as a major wheat exporter.
Russia took only half the quantity from
the US that was expected following the
decision to permit US sales to Russia.
It would be unlikely, of course, that
the US itself would consider entering
the Red China market—Australia’s great
standby—but there is no telling about
the Argentine now that she has entered
the wheat exports race.
The US will undoubtedly be looking
for somewhere to dispose of her expected
surplus, and much would depend on the
presidential election. Even if Red China
is out of the question for the US there
may be pressure to sell to some of the
Communist satellite countries which have
made useful purchases of Australian
wheat in recent years.
Argentina, like Australia and Canada,
seems prepared to sell wherever the mar-
ket offers. Unhappily, for Australia, the
Canadian and US price is likely to be
lower.
North America has improved crop
prospects following rains in the “hard
winter” wheat area, particularly Western
Kansas. Canada expects to export 550
million bushels for the season ending
July 31. This is easily a record. The
US expects to export 850 million com-
pared with its previous record of 720
million.
A Russian delegation was recently in
Canada negotiating purchases for ship-
ment in the last quarter of this year.
In Western Europe, farmers are opti-
mistic and there seems little likelihood
of sales of Australian wheat to Europe.
France expects a crop of 475 million
bushels compared with 350 million in
1963.
Italy expects to harvest 330 million,
which is enough to make her independent
of imports.
Greece expects a surplus of home
grown wheat for the first time in many
years. (Greece uses 70 million bushels
a year.)
In Ottawa the Canadian Trade Minis-
ter, Mr Mitchell Sharp, said recently that
prospects for Canadian wheat were excel-
lent whether Russia bought any or not.
He informed the Opposition Leader,
Mr John Diefenbaker, that the Canadian
Wheat Board was in constant touch with
Soviet authorities. He admitted there
was “great uncertainty” about further
Russian purchases.
What are the Australian crop pros-
pects?
The chairman of the Australian Wheat
Board, Mr J. V. Moroney, said good rain
was badly needed in many areas to give
the crops a good start. If the weather
was favorable, Australia was probably
on the way to a new record harvest.
This being so it looks as if all the
wheat producers of the world are look-
ing forward to good crops; possibly
record crops.
Some astute bargaining, therefore, in
the disposal of surplus wheat may be
expected. But there should be no reason
for despondency. Even with record
wheat harvests in all countries the needs
of the world for wheat far outweigh the
supply.
It seems a pity that the GATT talks
appear to have bogged down somewhat
in Geneva because in principle, as envi-
saged by the late President Kennedy, the
idea was to enable a wider distribution
of the world’s wealth in goods and food-
stuffs.
A tremendous world glut of wheat,
therefore, might not be a bad thing—in
principle. Huge surpluses on one hand,
and millions of empty mouths on the
other, might get GATT cracking.
Victorian Department of Agricul-
ture reports that grass tetany pellets
recently tested at Benalla now offer the
easiest way to control grass tetany in
cattle.
The pellets, which contain 25 p.c.
“Causmag” (magnesium oxide), can be
fed to cattle in the bail or in the pad-
dock. No mixing or spraying is needed,
nor is it necessary to feed hay at the
same time.
In the paddock the pellets are put out
in little heaps so that all cows can get
at them. The cattle quickly develop a
preference for them over hay, as they
contain bran, pollard, oats, molasses and
salt and have a considerable feed value.

A new herbicide called Propazine has
shown considerable promise in rais-
ing the yield of shelled peas, according
to a field officer of the Victorian Depart-
ment of Agriculture. In tests at Glenor-
miston the yield was increased by 800
lb an acre.
The tests with Propazine will be con-
tinued this season before the department
will make a definite recommendation.
Showground for Sugar
T>roserpine Show Society has de-
cided to plant six acres of its show-
grounds with sugarcane for eventual sale
of the plants to local farmers.
The idea —to raise money for the
Society—has been under consideration
for a long time. Voluntary labor will
be used for ploughing.

United Graziers’ Association in
A Queensland has protested to the
Sugar Board over what it calls the “ap-
parent lack of measures to control the
spreading of the cane toad” in the
State.
The toad was introduced to control
cane beetles in the sugar cane areas on
the coast, but it was claimed that instead
of doing this they have migrated 1000
miles inland from Rockhampton and
their rapid increase is causing concern
to graziers.

Republic of Sudan is being helped

erected a mill with a capacity for crush-
ing 5000 tons a day.
