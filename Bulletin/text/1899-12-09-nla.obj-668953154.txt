For Australians.
in Temple Bar maga-
\ \ zi-ne for October, a son of Daniel
O’Connell tells how he was
struck by the fact that the universal
adoration of Irishmen never seemed to
stimulate his father to personal vanity or
to disturb his equanimity. To his son’s
question how this might be, O’Connell
answered simply, “ I pray very often.”
Nor is it likely that the answer was sug-
gested by a mere religious pose. O’Con-
nell’s hereditary piety was sufficiently in-
tensified by life-long habit to make sin-
cere prayer both natural and necessary.
And doubtless his character was strength-
ened by the religious faith which to him
meant so much—and to Australians, on
the whole, so little.
* * • *
For even the clerical party is forced to
admit that every year religion and reli-
gious observances have less hold upon
Australia, and exercise less influence
upon the development of the national
character. Our fathers brought with
them the religious habit as they brought
other habits of elder nations in older
lands. And upon religion, as upon
everything else, the spirit of Australia—
that undefined, indefinable resultant
of earth, and air, and-conditions of climate
I and life—has seized ; modifying, altering,
ncreasing, or altogether destroying. In
;he case of religious belief the tendency is
dearly to destruction —partly, no doubt,
because with the spread of mental en-
ightenment the tendency is everywhere
jO decay of faith in outworn creeds ; but
partly also, it seems, because the Aus-
tralian environment is unfavourable to
the growth of religion, and because there
is in the developing Australian character
a sceptical and utilitarian spirit, which
values the present hour and refuses to
sacrifice the present for any visionary
future incapable of rational guarantee.
O’Connell prayed, and was benefited by
prayer, because prayer belonged to his
temperament —he was fitted to pray.
Doubtless there are still in Europe many
similar individuals in whom heredity has
not yet been ousted by the progress of
thought. But, except as adherents of
O’Connell’s creed, or among women—
with minds more slowly moving, there
are very few of his temperament in Aus-
tralia. In the religious sense, pro-
bably nineteen-twentieths of Australians
are heathen. In this country the rudi-
ments of religious faith have been up-
rooted or were never rooted ; we cannot,
if we would, derive from daily prayer
O’Connell’s daily stimulus and solace.
Our fathers went regularly to church and
chapel as a matter of conscience, and
were none the worse for it; we go chiefly
as a matter of custom, and are none the
better for it in any vital sense ; most of
us do not go at all. The holy Sabbath,
degenerated to the formal Sunday, has
become the weekly holiday in city and
bush. Beyond the perfunctory obser-
vances associated with it, the day is
meaningless : it has lost for us the essen-
tially sacred character which it had for
O’Connell—which it still has for men
of O’Connell’s temperament. No one
who knows Australia can doubt that
these statements are generally true.
! Our fathers, or their fathers, or some of
I them, had the kernel of religion : we in
Australia have little more than the husk,
i and we shall have less and less husk as
the years go by.
i * • • •
| The loss of religion is not a thing to
deplore, yet it may seem sometimes a
! thing to regret. With Emerson,
I I like a priest, I like a cowl,
I I love a prophet of the soul;
And on my heart monastic aisles
I Fall like sweet strains or pensive smiles :
Yet not for all his faith can see
Would I that cowled churchman be.
The downfall of geocentric philosophy
necessarily implies the ruin of geocentric
religions.' If their relics linger for a
thousand years or five thousand, that is
little more than a moment in the probable
history of the human race ; and assuredly
humanity will find a rational stick to re-
place the irrational crutch. Our present
difficulty, and it is not Australia s diffi-
culty alone, is that for many people the
influence of reason upon character is not
yet so potent as has been the influence of
faith.
We stand between two worlds, one dead.
The other powerless to be born.
We have lost religion, and we have
not yet adapted ourselves to the loss.
Like a drunkard suddenly deprived of
his dram, we are ill at ease, uni’eady for
emergencies. Whether religion did or
did not do more harm than good is a
profitless question. The religious stage
was one stage in human evolution, as
natural as the irreligious stage which is
superseding it. Religion gave to all men
what they were in their day and genera-
tion fitted to receive. To the weak it
was an opiate or a maddening draught,
but to the strong a magnificent stimu-
lant. In many of the most memorable
episodes of history it infused into the
veins of nations a courage and a strength
which we have not yet quite attained
without it. For the Covenanters, for the
Puritans, for the little Dutch republic
fighting for its life against overwhelming
Spain as that other little Dutch republic
is to-day fighting for its life against
overwhelming Britain, it edged the
sword of patriotism and sharpened
the pike of liberty. Lacking religion,
one cannot but think that some of the
most inspiring national contests and re-
sistances of the past would not have been
continued quite so strenuously or quite so
long. Horatius fought all the better for
the ashes of his fathers because he had a
sincere reverence for the temples of his
gods.
• * * •
And here in Australia, we have no
temples, no ashes worth the name. We
have still to make the history and create
the legendary associations which are such
a powerful binding force in national
life. The Murray to Australians is still
only a geographical label ; but think
what the Thames means to an English-
lin ! Think how Nelson was nerved by
e thought of Westminster Abbey ; of
iw his sailors were nerved by the signal
England expects . . .” ! What a
ass of record and tradition, of song and
ory, of memorable life and love and
;ath, presses behind that England /
usWalia is meaningless by comparison,
eking the inspiration of the past,
ut is it not possible to catch mean-
Lg and inspiration from the future 1
At not better to be of those who make
t. Crispin’s day worthy remembrance
xan of those who look back to remember
, ? This country has still for us few
allowed associations ; but if we choose
, may have them for our children.
£ we are not History’s legatees, it is
ecause we have the chance to be
listory’s founders and stablishers. And,
ven already, there are many who see in
bis vast virgin land a brooding charm
ot to be exchanged for England’s
hequered story. There is even already
nostalgia for the breadth of the bush
nd the breath of the gums which yields
othing in intensity to the nostalgia for
he green turf and the hawthorn-buds in
Peasant Warwickshire lanes. Even
Iready, how few Australians would ex-
hange for England’s glowing national
unset —or if you will, her splendid noon
—our own intimate and fragrant dawn 1
* • • *
It is the duty and should be the pride
>f every father and mother and teacher
>f Australian children to intensify the
xatural love of Australia, and to point
>ut in how many ways Australia is
;minently worthy to be loved—both the
ictual land and the national ideal. Good
md evil are mingled everywhere ; but
bhere is no land with more beautiful
aspects than Australia, no ideal with
greater potentialities of human achieve-
ment and human happiness. Australia
may never be a great country; but it will
be the fault of the people, not of the
land, if it is not * one of the best
countries in the world to live in
and die in given that we are
free from foreign aggression until we
are able to resist foreign aggression.
The grotesque English prejudice against
things Australian, founded on no
better reason than that they are
unlike English things, still remains
to vitiate the local sense of local
beauty ; but every year is teaching
us wisdom. We are gradually learning
that there are no more beautiful trees in
the world than Australian gum-trees—
particularly if seen against the sky,
when amber days or purple nights play
hide - and - seek among the wayward
branches. We have learnt to laugh at
the ridiculous and reiterated fiction that
Ir flowers have no scent and our biids
* song. Why, the whole bush is
ented ; in no land is there a greater
3a lth of aromatic perfume from tree and
rub and flower—making the daisied
eadows of England, as honest Eng-
hman Charles Kingsley avers, tame
id suburban by comparison. And if
>u go up beyond the tropic-line, and
5,1 k out of your tent at dawn, the air
literally weighed down with the frag-
,nce of a hundred brilliant flowers.
r hat would they not give in England
r ten acres of wattle - blossom on
r imbledon Common? and how many
ghtingales would they exchange for a
ght of crimson lories at sunset —a
tower of flaming rubies ? If the
stle brown English birds sing better
tan our many-plumaged parrakeets, is
)t the strife at least equal ? Does not
ae colour yield as much pleasure to the
•tist eye as fine song to the artist ear ?
/"hen will Englified city critics realise
lat Australia is a vast country which
ctends through forty degrees of
titude and thirty-five of longitude,
id comprehends all climates, all
senery snow - capped mountain and
>rrid desert, placid lake and winding
ver, torrent and brook, charm as well as
randeur, garden and field as well as
lence and solitude ?
* * * *
It is heredity and custom which again
etray us. The rose is a beautiful flower,
ut the most beautiful only because thou-
mds of years of care and cultivation
ave been lavished to bring it to perfec-
ion, because thousands of lovers have
reathed its perfume, thousands of poets
ave apostrophised its exquisite form,
rive the same care and cultivation to a
undred modest bush flowers, draw
hem from obscurity as the rose
ias been drawn from the parent wilder-
iess, let them be worshipped and adored
hrough centuries of sentiment and
re have here the rivals of the rose her-
elf. Cluster the associations of the oak
md yew round the yarran or the cedar
and all the cedars of Lebanon were not
nore stately than those of the Herberton
icrub), and the oak and yew will shrink,
lot indeed into insignificance, but into
iheir proper proportion as regarded from
Australia. In a word, let us look at our
lountry and its fauna and flora, its trees
md streams, and mountains, through
dear Australian eyes, not through bias-
bleared English spectacles; and there is
ao better or more beautiful country in
the world.
« . * *
But it will never be a great country,
they tell us; “it has no great rivers. 1 '
Well, there have been great nations with-
out great rivers, as there have been great
rivers without great nations. Probably,
if the Eastern Dividing Chain could be
bodily shifted five hundred miles west-
ward, extending the coastal rainfall to
the interior, and sending a score of
considerable rivers and their tributaries
tumbling to the sea, Australian develop-
ment would be easier and Australian
prosperity more assured. Practicably,
were Lake Eyre connected with Lake
Torrens, Lake Torrens with Spencer
Gulf, and the ocean restored to its old
home in the central basin of Australia,
the clouds evaporated from a vast inland
sea might rise to increase the interior
rainfall and permanently mitigate the
severity of summer climate. But, leaving
the impossible and the dubious, what,
is the measure of national greatness ?
A vast population or an extended empire
does not necessarily make a great nation.
“ The great city,” says Whitman, “ is the
city with the greatest man or woman ;
and the great country is not that one
where millions of people toil squalidly in
order that comparatively few may live in
idleness and luxury. With a hare ten
thousand families, or less, Australia
might still be the greatest country in the
world, if only every individual had the
opportunity of living the best and most
enlightened life that was possible to him
—of fulfilling to the utmost his capacities
Ir development and happiness.
H * * *
It is the false standard of “ greatness ”
lich vitiates many published inferences
im the decreasing Australian birth-rate,
le European nations desire to increase
eir birth-rate because they are military
.tions, and because every son is a poten-
il soldier, every daughter the potential
other of a soldier. And, until our
unbers are such that we can defy aggres-
jn, similar reasons have weight in Aus-
alia also. But they are not the only
asons which have weight. The question
too large to discuss fully at presentbut
le may point out that, in the struggle for
itional ideals, the quality-standard is by
,r the most important, national exist-
lce being ort.ee assured. There is no
ational profit in the multiplication of
lildren destined to live and dm miserably,
.nd the decreasing Australian birth-
ite might be as much the token of a
ise restraint as of a weakening national
itality. Probably it is not; but it
light be. There is little occasion for
nxiety were the criminal aggregation of
le people in the coastal cities ended. It
i in the cities, not in the bush, that the
ational fibre is being in a hundred ways
lackened and destroyed. No one ac-
uainted with the every-day heroism de-
layed by our agricultural and mining
ioneers can have the least doubt of the
tability of the nation if the Men On The
jand are helped and encouraged as they
eserve to be helped and encouraged
s it is imperatively necessary for the
uture of Australia that they should be
elped and encouraged.
* * * *
The making of Australia proceeds,
according to the previous argument, with-
>ut the binding influence of religion. All
he more reason, then, to encourage the
growth of the nascent patriotic senti-
ment, and to pay attention to the develop-
nent of individual character. Patriot-
sm may have little or no logical warrant,
Dut while it remains a natural instinct
,t justifies itself. Yet the future
Australia depends in the last
resort neither upon the lessening re-
ligious force nor upon the increasing
patriotic force : it rests upon the charac-
ter of Australia’s inhabitants. If it be
the pride of every Australian boy to
become a better man than his father, of
every Australian girl to become a better
woman than her mother, of every Aus-
tralian father and mother to rear chil-
dren better than themselves, both the
individual and the nation will surely
have their reward.

THE Australian Public—who are
generally under the impression
that their native tongue is not
understood on board these
magnificent steamers—will doubtless
be gratified to learn that English
Stewards are carried on all steamers,
and that all officers are acquainted
dth the English language. Many
people look at the Overland Journey
from Marseilles to London with a sen-
timent of dread. They fancy that the
trip by train is tedious, that their
native tongue on foreign soil may not
be spoken or understood. All this is a
great mistake. The overland journey
from Marseilles to London, far from
being long and tedious, may be accom-
plished in 20 hours, as compared with
the 6 days’ sea trip by Gibraltar and
the Bay of Biscay. Again, the passen-
ger who has no special reason for
hurrying through the Continent may
leisurely travel over France during U
days, for which time his ticket is avail-
able. He is thus afforded an oppor-
tunity of visiting Paris, about which
city any praise would be almost out of
place. It may also be advisable to add
that in all Hotels of any standing
throughout the Continent, and espe-
cially in Paris, English is spoken as
well as French by all waiters.

Dorms of Application can be obtained from the Brokers.
It is proposed to form a company for the purpose of
Acquiring certain valuable auriferous areas, Containing
one hundred and twenty-five acres of land, situated on
Cudgegong River, at Yamble, and Morowolga, Two-
Mile Flat, for the purpose of dredging for gold, diamonds,
ttnd other precious stones.
This portion of the Cudgegong River has yielded very
large quantities of gold, and where the heavy water con-
tention has been temporarily surmounted, so that the
bottom wash could be lifted, some exceptionally rich
patches of gold have been obtairied. All miners who have
carried on developments in the viciriity universally admit
the uniformity of tlje gold-bearing gravels and drifts
from the surface down, also the fact that as depth is
attained the heaviest gold is found.
Outside the river bed and extensive beaches a very
large area of virgin country exists, which has been
proved to be of a general auriferous character, having a
good depth Of wash, which is not available to the ordi-
nary mining operator oil account of watet cbntehtions.
The famous Gulgong goldfields record is well known,
16 tons of gold haviiig been won from the field ; and as
the watershed of this field traverses through the whole of
the area now offered, this in itself should warrant the
assumption that heavy deposits exist.
Large numbers of diamonds have also been obtained,
a few of which have realised high prices, ranging up to
£l2O for a single stone. Recently diamonds of lustre
and brilliancy have been recovered from this portion of
the river bed by miners with ordinary appliances.
The following are extracts of statistical records con-
tained in a pamphlet on “ Diamonds : Their Occurrence
in New South Wales*” lately issued by the Department
Of Mines and Agrictilture j-f-
-“ Messrs. Taylor and Thompson give the iargest found
at ft§ carats, a perfectly colorless octahedron, discovered
in the Cudgegong River, below the Two-Mile Flat ; also
another of 3J carat. Two very excellent stones were
exhibited in the New South Wales Court of the Colonial
and Indian Exhibition, by Mr. R. H. D. White, weighing
respectively in the cut form 3 and 3J carats.” A basaltic
hill, situated on Mr. R. J. Hassell's property, on this por-
tion of the river, yielded in 1867 some thousands of dia-
monds, ranging from 1 to 15 to the load, by a primitive
sluicing hydrant.”
The diamonds, sapphires, and other precious stones are
a valuable adjunct, and will materially enhance the re-
turns. Other notable features of advantage are as follow:
—lst. The friable nature of the wash. 2nd. Its shallow-
ness, which, at the outside, does not exceed 20ft. in depth.
3rd. Absence of heavy boulders. 4th. Bed-roc.k, being of
a decomposed and chippy nature, easily worked with
buckets. sth. Abundance of firewood. 6th. Mudgee
railway terminus within 26 miles of the property ; splen-
did main road for hauling of material. 7th. Water ample
for all requirements. Bth. The economical mode of work-
ing, which costs Under 2d. (twopence) per yard for com-
plete treatment. The vendors are prepared to take the
whole payment in paid-up shares in the company.
The only agreements now affecting the company are an
agreement dated, the lBth of August, 1899, between
Richard James Hassall, Richard Rouse, Charles Martin
Lowe, and Charles Edward Hilton. Copy of which can
be inspected at the offices of the brokets, upon appli-
cation.
Reports upon the property by John W. H. Piper, Esq.,
C.E.M., A.1.M.E., and M.A.M., Inst., M.E., the well-
known New Zealand dredging expert, and by Mr. Geo.
Rush, are herewith appended.
Equitable Buildings, George-street, Sydney, October,
16th, 1899. To the Yamble Gold Mining and Diamond
Dredging Syndicate, Gulgong. Gentlemen,—ln compli-
ance with your request, I visited and examined your
dredging areas on the Cudgegong River, N.S.W., and
have the honor to report as follows :
The properties are situated about 26 miles from Mudgee
railway-station, and embrace about 125 acres of the river
bed and banks, extending for a distance of two miles
above and two miles below the bridge on the main road
between the first-named place and Wellington.
The river is one of the rich feeders of the Macquarie,
and has its confluence with the latter at Burrendong,
running through the same class of auriferous country as
the Macquarie.
The old lead has been worked in many places for good
results; as much as loz. wash, I believe, has been treated
on the two-mile flat adjoining the river. This lead has
been worked for a considerable distance, but great diffi-
culty has been experienced in coping with the water;
however, the field at one time, I believe, supported a
great number of miners. The lead crosses the river in
several places. The country rock is slate, running at
right angles with the river between bands of diorite.
The slate, where it has been exposed in the river bed,
has been found to be mostly decomposed and “ chippy.”
The wash to be worked consists of free water-worn gravel,
which may be easily dredged.
I would recommend the operations be commenced in
the river bed and beaches, and such of the banks as is
found profitable and economical to work, as there are
many years of work in the present river channel in sight.
The higher banks, where there is 9ft. or 10ft. of loam,
may be successfully dealt with later on, as with the march
of improvements in dredging devices the difficulty of
overburden will doubtless be easily overcome.
Evidence still exists of attempts that have been made
to work the river by wing dams, pumps, etc. Some years
ago, I understand, a party of Europeans attempted to
work Inders' waterhole, on your lower area, by damming
the river higher up and taking the water away in races on
each side of the waterhole, but a flood put a stop to
operations.
Two or three parties are at present profitably working
some of the beaches on your areas. I found, on inquiry,
that the beaches have been surfaced over and over again
for many years. It appears that after every flood a fresh
supply of gold is deposited, and the diggers are able to
earn a livelihood by cradling the previously-worked
ground over again. It is thought that the gold is thrown
up from the water-hole immediately above the beaches—
a not unreasonable conjecture.
Numerous prospects were taken from end to end of
your leases, in some cases under one or two feet of water,
and the results were highly satisfactory. On your upper
leases nine dishes of wash taken promiscuously over the
whole length of the lease yielded 2.28 grains ; counting
120 dishes to the load, this is equivalent to, say, 30 grains,
but, allowing 50 per cent, for boulders, etc., it totals, say,
to the load.
On your lower lease, 10 dishes of stuff yielded 1.62
grains, or at the rate of 19 grains to the load. Dividing
this again by two, means 8 grains to the load.
Another sample of three dishes yielded 2.845 grains.
This was taken from an unbottomed shaft on the river
bank above what is known locally as Hassall’s bss,ch.
Although this prospect goes to prove • the highly aurifer-
ous character of the ground, it would hardly be fair to
base any calculations upon it, as the prospect was taken
from the lower wash, of which there was about sft. of
auriferous wash showing, over which about 9ft. of over-
burden existed ; however, I fully expect the same class of
wash will be met with on the adjoining beach.
The gold is of good quality, and valued at, £4 per oz.
Some valuable diamonds have been found in the river.
The diamondiferous wash chiefly occurs where the basalt
crosses the river in several places on your areas.
I made several inquiries at to the depth of the ground,
but could get no definite information. However, judg-
InfT from appearances, I am of opinion that a dredge
working to a depth of 20ft. below the water level would
recover the deepest wash.
I would recommend a dredge of a capacity of about 100
tons per hour. A dredge of such capacity and capable of
working to a depth of 20ft., and stacking the tailings
about 16ft., with provision made to lengthen the elevator,
should it be found economical to work the high banks,
would cost about £6OOO. Your working expenses, includ-
ing tear and wear, should not exceed £56 per week.
As far as I saw, there were no large boulders to deal
with. Firewood and cartage are cheap, and there should
be no difficulty in getting machinery on to the ground,
as your best building site is only a few hundred yards
from the main road.
You will gather from the foregoing remarks that I am
favorably impressed with the property as a whole, and I
am of opinion that, should you equip the ground with a
suitable plant, it should pay handsomely.—Yours faith-
fully. JOHN \V. H. PIPER,

Gulgong, 16th August, 1899.
To the Shareholders of the Yamble Gold and Diamond
Dredging Syndicate, Gulgong.
Dear Sirs,— l have much pleasure in submitting a report
of tfiy inspection of your dredging area of 125 acres, situ-
ated on the Cudgegong River, between the junction of
Cudgebegong and Goolrtia Creeks with the said river, in
the parishes of Blragahbil, Yarrobil, and Wiadere, in the
counties of Wellington and Bligh.
I have every confidence in placing my report before you,
having had a practical mining experience of this locality
extending over a period of 26 years. The area applied for
embraces a length of over four miles on the Cudgegong
River, traversing the freehold properties of Mr. Charles
M. Lowe, Mr. Richard J. Hassail; and Mr. Richard
Rouse, Junr., and, from my own experience, and thor-
oughly reliable information obtained from other sources,
I can assert without fear of contradiction that the whole
of this poriion of the Cudgegong River has been
practically proved gold-bearing, and has yielded excep-
tionally heavy deposits of gold afld a large number of
diamonds.
The country rocks consist of diorite, slate, and sand-
stone formations, chiefly of a decomposed character, un-
der the alluvium. The wash is an ordinary river gravel,
of a friable nature, and devoid of very heavy boulders, and
I believe, thoroughly adapted for dredging purposes. I
estimate the average width of auriferous country to be
five (5) chains, with a good depth of gold-bearing gravel
and drift. The waterholes are extensive, and have Only
been partially worked, man3'attempts of expensive opera-
tions being ineffectual on account of the heavy water
contention and river freshes.
The banks are chiefly of a low-lying character, the
highest portion being about 10ft. above ordinary water-
level, and are auriferous the whole length of area applied
for. Go‘od, payable gold exists in many places, but is
not available to ordinary mining methods through the
treaeheroiis nature of the country Ufid heavy inflow of
water. There are no engineering difficulties to overcome.
Rock-bound bars, four in number, exist, but are not Of
serious dimensions. The country adjacent to the river
is well timbered and easy of access, firewood ample for all
contingencies being dose at hand.
The property is situated about 27 miles from Mudgee
railway station. The main Wellington road trends the
whole way to the river, thus offering splendid facilities
for the carting of dredging material.
The Cudgegong River, gold is noted for its good quality,
its Value being £4 per ounce. Shotty and flakey-body
gold preponderates, and I feel quite assured very little
gold will be lost during dredging operations.
To my knowledge, a number of valuable diamonds of
great brilliancy and pureness have been found in this
portion of the river, two, of beautiful color, having
realised £l2O and £49 respectively. Herewith I have
pleasure in showing for your inspection samples of gold
obtained last week, also 15 diamonds, which have been
unearthed from the river by cradling, &c., during the
past few months, and a sample of gem sand.
I prospected the river bed and banks, where practi-
cable, by dish washing-, and in every instance obtained
gold from the surface down to 9ft. in’ sufficient quantities
to pay handsomely by dredging operations. A paddock
was also put down 3ft. deep to water level on the bank of
the river, and I cradled a yard of the alluvium from sur-
face down, and obtained 13 grains of gold. In two other
places, about half-mile further down stream, I washed a
yard Of alluvium to a depth of 4ft., and obtained 17
grains of gold, and 9 grains from half a yard. These
prospects are herewith tendered for your inspection.
During my 26 years’ residence, from the large quantity
of gold that has been won from this piortion of the river
and adjoining locality, I have purchased several thousand
ounces, and a large number of diamonds, many of a Valu-
able character.
I feel convinced that, with the present approved dredg-
ing appliances, the above property will yield good pay-
able results, both in gold and diamonds, for many years
to come.—l aril, dear sirs, yours faithfully,
GEORGE RUSH, Mining Expert.

TESTIMONIALS.
“To the Davlesford Mineral Water Co.
“ Dear Sirs. —The Machine purchased from you is
perfect. Tub Stuff turned out is splendid. It is the
best speculation I have entered into since I joined the
Licensed Victuallers.— Geo. Nicholls, Royal Hotel, Swan
Hill.”
Mr. Klug, Hotelkeeper, Charlton, says “It is worth
its weioiit in gold.”
Mr. P. Kennedy, Hotelkeeper, Coolgardie, W. A., says:
—“ Profits saved by making my own supplies of Aerated
Waters with the Machine purchased from you, pay the
RENT OF MY HOTEL.”
Mr. Lewis, of Old England Hotel, Heidelberg,' says':—
“ I have now had one of your Aerated Water Machines in
use for three years, and have made thousands ok dozens
of the best Aerated Waters with it, and it has not
required sixpence worth of repairs. No Hotelkeeper
should be without one of these Machines.”
Mr. W. Atkinson, Hotelkeeper, Wentworth, N.S.W.,
says :—“lt is the greatest money maker yet discovered
for hotelkeepers.”
Mr. Burk, Hotelkeeper, Yalgoo, W.A., says:—“My
Aerated Water account was formerly £3O per month.
Since getting one of your Machines, and making my own
soft stuff, I have saved the price of the Machine ten times
over.”
A profitable business awaits pushing men in many
small centres of population, where a deeply-felt want
exists for a good quality of Aerated Waters. Observe
the profits. Call and see these Machines, or write for

CURED BY ONE BOTTLE OF HE ARNE’S
BRONCHITIS CURE.
THE DOCTOR SO INTERESTED THAT HE
CARRIED OFF THE EMPTY BOTTLE.
“Orange, N.S.W.
“ Mr. Hearne.—
“Dear Sir,—l enclose for your own private perusal
portion of a letter received from my mother, Mrs. ,
of London, England, from which you will glean that
your medicine has been a perfect God-send to a martyr to
colds and bronchial asthma. Ido not wish any names to
be mentioned, but you are at liberty to make use of any
portion of this letter you choose, and you can confidently
refer anybody to me.
“ I heard of your excellent remedy, and sent it to Eng-
land. You can see for yourself v.hat an immense success
it was. —Yours faithfully, .”
Extract from letter alluded to above :
“You will be interested in hearing that I think the
Bronchitis Cure realty excellent. I was very bad when it
arrived, and I immediately flew to it. That was last
Friday, and it has quite cured me. Dr. is very
much interested in it. He came yesterday, and carried
off the empty bottle to find out if he could get a full one
from a chemist who is in a large way here.”
The names are withheld from publication, but will be
supplied privately when desired.
AGONISING COUGH.
NINE MONTHS' TORTURE.
RELIEVED BY ONE DOSE OF HEARNE’S
BRONCHITIS CURE, AND CURED BY
TWO BOTTLES.
“ Dergholm, Victoria.
“ Dear Sir, —I wish to add ray testimony to the won-
derful effect of your Bronchitis Cure. I suffered for nine
months, and the cough was so distressingly bad at nights
I was obliged to get up and sit by the fire. I had medical
advice, and tried other ‘ remedies,’ without avail. I tried
yours, and never had a fit of coughing after taking the
first dose, and though I have had but two bottles I feel I
am a different man, and the cough has vanished. You
may depend upon my making known the efficacy of your
wonderful remedy to anyone I see afflicted.
“Yours faithfullv,
“JAMES ASTBURY.”
We, the undersigned, have had occasion to obtain
Hearne’s Bronchitis Cure, and we certify that it was per-
fectly and rapidly successful under circumstances which
undoubtedly prove its distinct healing power. Signed by

CHRISTMAS & NEW YEAR HOLIDAY EXCURSIONS
TO THE
SNOWY MOUNTAINS, THE LAKE COUNTRY, THE JENOLAN CAVES, THE HAWKESBURY RIVER,
KURRING-GAI CHASE, THE ILLAWARRA DISTRICT.
.QTHE advent of the Christmas Holidays is as heartily welcomed in New South
Wales as in England, and its value locally is greater, in the opportunity it
affords the metropolitan or the inland resident of taking a rest at a time when
climatic conditions cause a respite from labor to be most enjoyed. The former has
every facility for escaping for a time from the routine of city life to the cool atmos-
•phere of the charming mountain region that lies so close to Sydney, or the more
distant, but still easily-accessible snow country —“down by Kosciusko.”
Bowral or Moss Vale, the Fitzroy, Belmore, Meryla, Loddon, and other singu-
larly picturesque waterfalls may be visited, and a descent effected by way of
Kangaroo Valley, the Bulli Pass, or Macquarie Pass, into the richly fertile
Illawarra District.
Prom Goulburn, Holiday Eoccuvsion Tic7eets can be obtained for
Lake Bathurst ; Bungendore, for Lake George or Cooma, for the Yarrangobilly
Lakes, the most extensive in Australia, fairly rivalling the beauty of those at

THE WILLOWS.
The inland dweller finds the change equally pleasant in leaving his wide and
silent areas to seek pleasure in the many holiday attractions piovided in the metro-
polis, or to enjoy the charms of the sea-side. All are well provided for by the
extended railway facilities arranged for at Christmas time.
Sydney forms the main starting point
for holiday-makers, most of the leading
pleasure resorts being readily and cheaply
accessible from the metropolis, but the
system of Holiday Excursion Tickets en-
ables country residents to visit the prin-
cipal beauty spots in their own districts.
Thus, pleasure-seekers living in Goulburn
can enjoy the beauties of the lovely
country in which the Fitzroy, Meryla,
and other falls are situated, or make a
trip to the summit of Mount Kosciusko ;
while others residing in Bathurst may
proceed to the JENOLAN CAVES or
the BLUE MOUNTAINS, without the
trouble or cost of a journey to Sydney.
Special Excursion Tickets
from Sydney enable most of the pic-
turesque localities within easy reach of
the metropolis to be conveniently and
economically visited. On the Northern
Line is Kurring-Gai Chase, the new
National Park, in the heart of which is
Cowan Creek, with its unlimited facili-
ties for boating and fishing ; the Hawkes-
bury River, queen of Australian streams,
on which delightful trips may be made
by the commodious steamer, “ General
Gordon;” Brisbane Water, the Tug-
gerah Lakes, and Lake Macquarie,
where boating, sailing, fishing, bathing,
and other sports may be enjoyed to the
uttermost, alternated with delightful
rambles among the ferns and flowers of
the surrounding country.
To the west is the Nepean River,
with its lovely surroundings ; the Blue
Mountains, with their magnificent pano-
ramic views, glorious waterfalls and beauti-
ful scenery, each stopping place having,
its own special attractions; while from
Katoomba or Mount Victoria a visit n„'ij be made by coach or on horseback to
the JENOLAN CAVES, the great natural marvels of Australia, and said to be
equal to anything of their kind in existence. The Government have also recently
provided excellent accommodation convenient to the Caves, while the road journey
to them alone is worth the trip, even if the subterranean wonders did not exist.
Southwards is the charming tourist district between Mittagong and Goulburn,
which is rapidly becoming a fashionable summer resort. From here, either by way of

sunshine, where, on the summit of Mount Kosciusko, the visitor may enjoy the
refreshing coolness of an Alpine climate during the hottest months of the year, a
pleasure unique in Australian tourist travel.
On the Illawarra or South Coast Line is the National Park, the grand and
picturesque area reserved for the people, the lower waters of Port Hacking River
with the Park being much frequented by lovers of boating and fishing. Beyond

SAVES ONE-THIRD OF
THE COAL BILL and does
25 Per Cent. MORE WORK-
It works without water. Heats the iron in one-third less time.
The air peaches the iron in a heated state, and there are no black spots.
By means of a movable air director the blast can be directed to either side.
It can be adapted to any type of forge, and can be placed at any part of the forge, consequently
any size or shape of iron can be heated. It cannot choke or burn.
The iron is heated from 6 to 8 inches above the air chamber in a clean fire.
The ashes and small slag drop out on the floor without disturbing the fire. ,
It will last many years, and requires no skilled labour for setting in position. It is not recom-
mended for charcoal.

GIBRALTAR CON. GOLD
MINES, Ltd.,
Adelong, N.S.W.
Replying to your favor re the Billett’s Patent Tuyere, I have pleasure in
informing you that the five we have in use here have given unqualified satis-
faction. We have two blacksmiths’ forges and three drill-sharpeners’ forges
fitted with these Tuyeres, and, after a trial extending over some months, we
find that they effect a saving in coal of fully 30 per cent. Since the introduction of the Patent Tuyeres, our
men can sharpen 25 per cent, more drills than with the old style. They work equally well with either bellows
or compressed air, and I can recommend them most highly for any class of work.

Having- had a trial of the Patent Tuyeres we decided to use them as occasion
required, and up to the present have replaced twelve others by yours, and as
others require taking out intend to do the same until the whole of the fires are
fitted with them. The twelve now in use give every satisfaction ; they give a
greater blast, need less attention, save the smith’s time in keeping fires clean,
and one other advantage is that no water is required; therefore there is no danger of being burned out by
neglect. ( Signed ) W. 0. BARTON, Manager.

We have much pleasure in recommending Billett’s Patent Tuyere. We had

that we got two more of a larger size which have given every satisfaction,
both in small and heavy work. ( Signed ) OVERALL & OVERALL.
R. SPENCER,
Coach and Trolly Builder,
Adelaide.
I have given the Billett’a Tuyeres a good trial, and find, after carefully com-
paring them with the old style of Water Tew Iron, that they effect a saving of
30 per cent, in coal and about 25 per cent, in labour, when they are in the hands
of intelligent smiths. My head smith says they don’t burn half the coal, and
says he can do twice as much work, but you can take it from me that my estimate is about correct.
( Signed ) R. SPENCER.
WILLIAM KNIGHT,
Farrier,
UO Kent Street, Sydney.
I have used your Tuyeres lor over two years, and fitted up another fire with
one the other day. I don’t know how much coal they save, but Ido know that
I nan make eight more sets of shoes in a day than with the old style, and I am
well satisfied. '(Signed) WILLIAM KNIGHT.

About twelve months ago we had our forges fitted with your Billett’s

the fires being always clean. I have great confidence in recommending
them in every instance where forges are used. ( Signed ) JAS. CARROLL, Mine Manager.

The direction of the blast is shown by the arrows in Fig. 3. The arrangement by
which the Tuyere and the blast mutually serve each other is admirable. The
blast keeps the Tuyere cool, while the Tuyere makes the blast hot. The result is
a marked economy of fuel. All that heat which, with the water tuyere, is used boiling water for no useful
purpose, with the Billett’s Tuyere is used in doing useful work, and likewise the heat which under ordinary
circumstances would burn the hottom out of the forge, with Billett’s Tuyere heats the blast and saves the coal

GENUINE “POT-STILL” WNISKEYS.
The London Daily Telegraph of
September 28, 1899, in referring to the
great demand for the pure “ Pot-Still ”
whiskeys of the Dublin Distillers in
England, says :
“ The Irish Distilleries hold great stocks ol
“ whiskey which many people fancy is better
“ matured than that imported from Scotland.
“ There are two kinds of spirit, ‘ Pot ’ spi "t and
“ ‘ Patent ’ spirit, which are very different in cost
“ and quality. The first named is the natural
“ whiskey made from pure malt. The ‘ patent ’
“ whiskey is pure alcohol without what distillers
“ call ‘ body or flavor.’ It can be made from the
“ cheapest raw grain or Indian corn.”
The Dublin Distillers Co. Ltd.
guarantee that all their whiskeys are
genuine “ Pot-Still ’’ whiskeys.

WILD-FLOWER BY THE WAY

11HE sun-rays burnt like brands a-flrp,
And with a half-mile spread
In blue-grass to their heart’s desire
The big windorahs fed.

I rode the wing—oh ! frail pretence—
What trick doth Love disdain ?

She stood before her cottage home,
A maid of dimpled charms,
And churned the suds to snow-white foam
Across her nut-brown arras.

She flashed those splendid orbs of brcrwn
And whispered soft and low:
I’d love to see this Sydney Town
Where all the cattle go ! ”

And half believed it true :
“No lady there has lips so red,

To pass dull time away ;
But Brown Eyes of the Barwon laughed:
“ So all you drovers say 1 ”

I had no longer need to speak 5
Chained by those eyes, of brown,
I kissed her once for Barwon Creek

The wild flowers by the way ! ”

[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
Yes, she would do it, for the Mother’s sake.
The Mother, who lived on hope, and ate the
stalks of the cauliflowers, and the children’s crusts,
and said she liked them, The Mother, who had
borrowed from the Angels a gleam of such eternal,
exquisite kindness that her brown eyes mirrored
always the million departed tendernesses she had
given away to her children. The Mother, with
her figure going into flesh now, and her hair yield-
ing its brown uncomplainingly to grey, and her
hands showing the toil of years, the stitches, and
the cooking, and the pitiless plunging into hot
water and cold water, through forty years. The
Mother, whose mouth was sweeter than ever in its
smile, but was sad now when she was sleeping.
The dear, dear Mother, great, small woman. . .
Yes, for her sake.
And the lump we all know would rise in Alison’s
throat, and that stinging sharpness would make
her eyes ache suddenly, and it would seem to her
that her heart stopped beating for a moment, as
the words formed themselves- obstinately on her
mind, “When she dies ” . . . and it was the
Mother she was thinking of. That lump in her
throat again. . . We all know it. . . Every
day the hearts of strong men and quiet women
throb and ache, facing the thought for the first
time that the woman who is mother to them will
be dead some day.
Always poverty. Always a struggle. Always
failure. And always the crusts and the stalks
going quietly to the Mother, while the children
grew strong and noisy on the flower. They were
grown up now, all of them. Married and scat-
tered. Only Alison, the youngest, remained.
The boys had all married poor girls. The girls
had all married poor men. The sickening struggle
had only been extended. It spread its branches
further even than before, and Alison watched her
mother, and knew that all poor George’s troubles,
and poor Clara’s, and poor Edith’s, and poor
Jem’s, and poor Alfred’s, were crushing her, body
and soul.
One evening the Mother dropped to sleep over
her sewing. Mosquitos came and buzzed around
her. Alison flicked them noiselessly away. The
Mother’s mouth changed in her sleep. She
smiled. Then the lips fell apart, and all the story
of the woman’s toil, and anguish, and disappointed
hopes was written in the grieving, despairing
droop of her mouth. Alison could not bear to
look. She touched her mother gently oil the arm
and woke, her.
“The chestnut-trees, ”said the Mother, drowsily.
“Oh ! I thought I was in Paris, and it was
Spring.”
She sighed, but she smiled presently, and went
on making trousers for Edith’s youngest boy. She
had never been out of Australia.
What did she know of Paris and the chesnut-
trees? Nothing, except what she had read. Only
what her ardent, fervid, joyous imagination, al-
ways desiring, always denied, had pictured for her
mockingly all these forty years.
The Tower of London; Windsor Castle; if she
could only see them before she died ! And the
Downs of Kent, and the Lakes of Killarney!
Surely it was never meant that she should die
without seeing them. And London, and the
English lanes, woven in her dreams, all real and
close to her. She had always believed she would
get there some day, and had never wholly stifled
the ache because of the belief.
This year a man had fallen in love with Alison
who could take the whole family to Paris ten times
over, all the big and little Georges, and Claras,
and Ediths, and Jems, and Alfreds, and everyone
was holding his breath, or hers, and praying that
Alison would marry him. He was a frightfully
wealthy man. He was kind and a bore, and good-
looking, and conceited, and stupid, and Alison
was always weary after five minutes conversation
with him.
“ I feel as if I had done a day’s washing,” she
always said to herself when he had gone.
And yet she had made up her mind. To-night
he was coming for his answer, and she was going
to tell him she would marry him—and soon, as
soon as possible.
There was only one condition. She wanted to
take her mother with them for a trip round the
Continent he had spoken of.
The Mother in Paris ! The Mother in London !
She dropped her face into her hands and leaned
down on the table, and thought of that short, stout
figure, at last—at last —having its fill of earthly
happiness, travelling to the desired and dreamed-
of countries that had always allured and fasci-
nated her, even in her hardest, bitterest working-
times in a dull little Australian township. Little
imaginative woman, with her immense capacities
for happiness, she would see them all at last, and
it would be Alison who had taken her to them,
aided by a sacrifice, no doubt, but what was one
sacrifice beside the thousands the Mother made,
and smiled over!
He would be here in an hour.
She got up and walked round the room, and
looked at the photographs on the walls and little
tables. There were photographs everywhere.
“Our only furniture,” she had often said, “and
only ours because they were given.”
There were photographs of girls, and women,
and children, and a few men. She wandered
about looking at them, as she had looked for years
at most of them. The fevered condition of her
mind drove sharp fancies into her head. How
miserable all these people looked ! Who looked
happy ? Not one.
What would they all think about her marriage?
Tennyson there, in the panel-frame beside
Kipling ; what would he say ? Could he offer
anything better ? She looked long into his face,
and smiled sneeringly. Eor the first time she
had read his deep-worn eyes, and discovered there
was no happiness there. His face was gloomy,
thoughtful, full of problems, not radiant, not joy-
ful. And Kipling, from his spectacles, looked at
her quizzically, but gave her no assurance that
life was jolly and illumined. Then there were all
the married women, with that anxious married
look about their eyes, and all the pretty white-
shouldered girls in evening frocks, looking wist-
fully, in spite of their poses, for the good time
they believed would be theirs in the future.
There was the photograph of a young singer who
had made a great name suddenly, and gone on
adding to it ever since. She looked worn and
worried. It was taken just after the name came.
And the married men, men she had known as
boys, some of them, their eyes had nothing to tell
but toil after money, toil after pleasure ; which-
ever way they had taken, it was still toil that
crowned them and chained them. One look was
stamped on every face, when you came to notice
it. Her young poets, and her old poets, illus-
trious men and women in the flower of youth, or
in the reddening leaf, or the decaying— all the
features seemed to grow towards a point, to strain
towards it—their eyes sought something, their
mouths cried for something. There was no hap-
piness written on any of them. Whatever it was
they looked for it was not theirs yet; even the
oldest of them had not got what they wanted.
Looking at these photographs was like peering
behind the masks of all these people. Those who
wore smiles did not deceive her, for the photo-
graphs betrayed the unsmiling state of the eyes.
She looked and looked slowly at them all, and
looking, wondered how anyone dared be photo-
graphed to give a fellow creature the chance to
read the truth about him as she was reading it
now.
She would marry this deadly wearisome Rogers,
because nobody was happy, whatever was done]
and she was not losing anything after all.
And, on the other hand, if she refused to marry
.Rogers, and the struggle with the children’s chil-
dien went on, and the Mother died, never seeing
the Tower of London, or the Paris chestnut-
flowers well, to see them might not have made
her happy after all
And then she picked up a little cheap portrait in
a plam white frame, taken five years before. Out
of the white frame looked a grey-haired, furrowed
old woman, with lines across her forehead and
lines running down either side of her mouth, and
crossed and intercrossed lines around the corners
of her tired eyes. The photographer had “touched
iier up but little ; his prices were too low for that.
It was the mother, indeed; not wearing the
mask of a smile that had become a habit, but look-
ing straight out with the pale despair of her over-
worked body and soul engraven on her face.
It was the only one she had ever had taken:
that was why they had not burnt it.
And Rogers came into the room.
“ fwas looking at the photographs, ” she said
feverishly, ‘ and they all look so miserable.”
What makes you think so,” said Rogers
heavily. Anyway, this doesn’t.”
1 drew out ■of his breast-pocket a portrait of
herself at sixteen in a white frock and a pigtail,
lie was facetious. It was too much, she would
not marry him. She seized it and stared at it.
It was twelve years since. . . The big blue
eyes were dancing with fun and light-hearted
happiness, and the lovely girlish mouth was turn-
ing a laugh into a beaming smile. A careless ex-
,U«?Tie . seem °d f° radiate from every feature.
I stole it,” said Rogers ; “don’t be angry.”
Rut she was looking into her own face, not his.
1 1 the only happy one of all the photo-
graphs—the only radiant face of all the lot. My
trod !it was she who did that for me. How did
she manage ? At what cost did she make me look
like that? Yes, yes, the Tower of London—l
niean 1 mean, yes, when you ask me ! ”
LOUISE MACK.
Father Riley’s Horse.
(FOR THE BULLETIN.)
’Twas the horse-thief Andy Regan that was
hunted like a dog
By the troopers of the Upper Murray side;
They had searched in every gully—they had
looked in every log,
But never sight or track of him they spied
Till the priest at Kiley’s crossing heard a knock-
ing very late,
And a whisper, “Father Riley—come across ! ”
So his Rev’rence, in pyjamas, trotted softly to
the gate
And admitted Andy Regan—and a horse !
Jsow, its listen, Father Riley, to the words I’ve
got to say,
For it’s close upon my death I am to-night ;
With the troopers hard behind me I’ve been
hiding all the day
In the gullies, keeping close and out of sight.
But they’re watching all the ranges till there’s
not a bird could fly,
And I’m fairly worn to pieces with the strife ;
So I’m taking no more trouble, but I’m going
home to die—
’Tis the only way I see to save my life !
“ Yes, I’m making home to mother’s, and I’ll die
a Toosday next,
An be buried on the Thursday—and, of course,
I m prepared to meet my penance, but with one
thing I’m perplexed,
And it’s—Father, it’s this jewel of a horse !
He was never bought nor paid for, and there’s not
a man can swear
To his owner or his breeder, but I know
That his sire was by Pedantio from the old Pre-
tender mare,
And his dam was close related to the Roe.
“And there’s nothing in the district that can
race him for a step ;
He could canter while they’re going at their top.
He s the king of all the leppers that was ever seen
to lep
A five-foot fence—he’d clear it in a hop !
So I’ll leave him with you, Father, till the dead
shall rise again ;
’Tis yourself that knows a good ’un, and, of course,
You can say he’s got by Moonlight out of Paddy
Murphy’s plain,
If you’re ever asked the breeding of the horse.
“But it’s getting on to daylight and it’s time to say
good-bye
I or the stars above the east are growing pale.
And I’m making home to mother; and it’s hard
for me to die !
But it’s harder still in keeping out of gaol!
You can ride the old horse over to my grave across
the dip
Where the wattle bloom is waving overhead.
Sure he 11 jump them fences easy; you must never
raise the whip
Or he’ll rush ’em ! now good-bye ! ’’—and he had
fled.
“So they buried Andy Regan, and they buried
him to rights,
In the graveyard at the back of Kiley’s Hill.
There were five and twenty mourners who had five
and twenty fights,
Till the very boldest fighters had their fill.
There were fifty horses racing from the graveyard
to the pub.
And their riders flogged each other all the while.
And the lashins of the liquor ! And the lavins of
the grub !
Oh ! poor Andy went to rest in proper style.
Then the races came to Kiley’s—with a steeple-
chase and all
For the folk were mostly Irish round about,
And it takes an Irish rider to be fearless of a fall
.They were training morning in and morning out.
But they never worked their horses till the sun
was on the course,
For a superstitious story kept ’em back,
That the ghost of Andy Regan, on a slashing
chestnut horse,
Had been training by the starlight on the track.
And they read the nominations for the races
with surprise
And amusement at the Father’s little joke,
For a novice had been entered for the steeplechas-
ing prize,
And they found that it was Father Filey’s moke !
He was neat enough to gallop, he was strong
enough to stay,
But his owner’s views of training were immense.
For the Reverend Father Riley used to ride him
every day,
And he never saw a hurdle nor a fence.
And the priest would join the laughter—“Oh,”
said he, “ I put him in,
For there’s five and twenty sovereigns to be won.
And the poor would find it useful if the chestnut
chanced to win,
And he’ll maybe win when all is said and done ! ’
He had called him Faugh-a-ballagh, which is,
French for “Clear the course,”
And his colors were a vivid shade of green.
All the Dooleys and O’Donnells were on Father'
Riley’s horse,
While the Orangemen were backing Mandarin !
It was Hogan the dog-poisoner—aged man and,’
very wise—
Who was camping in the racecourse with his swag,
And who ventured the opinion, to the township’s,
great surprise,
That the race would go to Father Riley’s nag.
“You can talk about your riders—and the horse
has not been schooled—
And the fences is terrific, and the rest!
When the field is fairly going then ye’ll see ye’ve
all been fooled,
And the chestnut horse will battle with the best.
“For there’s some has got condition, and they
think the race is sure,
And the chestnut horse will fall beneath the
weight,
But the hopes of all the helpless, and the prayers
of all the poor,
Will be running by his side to keep him straight.
And what s the need of schoolin’ or workin’ on
the track
Whin the saints are there to guide him round the
course !
I’ve prayed him over every fence—l’ve prayed
him out and back !
And 111 bet my cash on Father Riley’s horse! ’’
* * * *
Oh the steeple was a caution ! They went tearim
round and round,
And the fences rang and rattled where they struck.
There was some that cleared the water; there was
more fell in and drowned,
Some blamed the men and others blamed the *
luck !
But the whips were flying freely when the field;
came into view
For the finish down the long green stretch of;
course,
And in front of all the flyers-jumpin’ like a,
kangaroo,
Came the rank outsider—Father Riley’s horse!:
Oh the shouting and the cheering as he rattled I
past the post!
For he left the others standing in the straight;
And the rider,—well they reckoned it was Andy;
Regan’s ghost,
And it beat ’em how a horse could draw thei
weight!
But he weighed it—nine stone seven, then he-
laughed and disappeared
Like a Banshee (which is Spanish for an elf),
And old Hogan muttered sagely, “If it wasn’t for
the beard
They’d be thinking it was Andy Regan’s self ! *
And the poor of Riley’s Crossing gave their
thanks at Christmas-tide
To the chestnut and his jockey dressed in green.
I here was never such a rider, —not since Andy
Regan died —
And they puzzled who on earth it could have been.
But they settled it among ’em—for the story got
about,
Mongst the bushmen and the people on the course
That the Devil had been ordered to let Andy Regan
out
For the steeplechase on Father Riley's horse !
THE BANJO.
The Boer, when you come to consider him,
carefully, seems to be mainly a bitter satire on,
religion—the ordinary parsonical kind ;or else a
shining credit to religion, just as you care to take
him. He is just about what the Briton and the
Australian would be if they took their religion as ;
seriously as he does. He is brave, like the Israelite
aiid the Philistine of old, and as every man is;
who is dead sure that his God is on his side. He is,
bitteily ignorant. Like the average parson, he'
holds that a thorough knowledge of the Bible is;
the biggest part of a liberal education, so he;
knows the Bible, and he doesn’t know much his;
tory, science, geography, or anything else. He
has no art, partly because he takes literally the
Biblical command against graven images. He is
dubious about everything in the way of progress,
because, when a new idea comes along, he looks to
see if it is mentioned in the Bible—and it isn't.
He is hospitable, because the Bible preaches hos-
pitality. He is none too clean, because the Bible
isn’t very strong on cleanliness, and there is no
eleventh commandment :—“ Thou shalt take
a bath.” He is proud—intensely proud—because
he is one of the Chosen Race ; every nation which
takes its religion very seriously regards itself as a
Chosen Kane. He rises, 80,000 of him, to face
the 300 millions of the British empire, and is not
afraid, because he has read about Gideon, and be-
cause he takes in resolute earnest the scriptural
promises-that on the day of battle God will be
with those who believe in Him, and he knows that
he believes with a whole-souled earnestness. He
is just a primitive believer going out with hisß bli
to batter the Assyrian. He has already battered
the Canaanite who previously owned the land and
in his treatment of him he had good scriptural
precedent as set down in the case of Joshua And
when he is licked, and his country gi\en over to
the wealthy, and bejewelled, and bear’s-greasul
worldings of Johannesburg, it will be so much the
worse for the primitive variety of religion.


JUST A MINUTE, PLEASE!
Tired men, whether suffering from physical or
mental fatigue, delicate women, growing girls and
little children find Dr. Tibbies’ Vi-Cocoa a unique
beverage of inestimable benefit. The nauseous
drugs and disagreeable medicines associated with
ill-health are, in Dr. Tibbies’ Vi-Cocoa, replaced
by something which is plea a t and nice, with a
distinctive flavoring of its own which will appeal
to the fastidious and over-nice palate of the
invalid, and its soothing effect renders it an ideal
“Pick-me-up.”
Dr. Tibbies’ Vi-Cocoa, by taking the place of
stimulants of an ardent nature, has made, happy
many a home which otherwise to-dav would have
been wretched, and the ultimate effects of which
it is impossible to foresee. For breakfast, dinner,
supper—indeed, at any hour of the twenty-four—
Dr. Tibbies’ Vi-Cocoa will be found light and
refreshing ; it leads the way among all beverages,
and nothing can equal it.
The unique vitalising and restorative powers of
Dr. Tibbies’ Vi-Cocoa are being recognised to an
extent hitherto unknown in the history of any
preparation. Merit, and merit alone, is what is
claimed for Dr. Tibbies’ Vi-Cocoa, and the pro-
prietors are prepared to send to any reader who
names The Bulletin (a postcard will do) a dainty
sample tin of Dr. Tibbies’ Vi-Cocoa free and post-
paid.

Mystery.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
“ This isn’t built for galloping, Jorrocks.”
Jorrocks left his racer and waddled over to me,
leading his fat cob. “ Wot’s the matter with
him? He ain’t too bad. Can’t stay with that of
mine, which is a bit of a flyer, of course ; but my
’oss only wants a start.”
* * * •
As I ranged alongside the racehorse, Mystery
gave a wicked buck and then reared, and when I
eased my hands, took a bound forward. I wheeled
him and lined witli the other. Jorrocks grinned,
dropped his red handkerchief, and we were off!
Mystery, with a leapt, his head Up, flew clear of
the other from the start. Before four furlongs my
horse was leading anyhow, going like a typhoon,
and I realised I had never sat his sort before,
though I had ridden ramping Kattiwar stal-
lions in wild, whooping, cavalry charges. He
seemed to have swollen to twice his normal girth,
to be bigger every way. Unsuspected mighty
muscles churned under me like steel piston rods.
He was difficult to sit at speed. I pulled
hard and found his fault. He reared, even in
the middle of his enormous stride—another ounce,
on the snaffle, and he would have come over
backwards. I gave him his head, kept my hands
low, and let him thunder on. Two-thirds of the
way down the bay I glanced astern : the jockey
was flowing viciously ! Looking ahead, I sighted
something I had forgotten—a stream crossing the
track to the sea ; the take-off, for feet, wicked
quicksand ; a well-known trap, possible only to a
great jumper in hand. While I pondered, Mys-
tery flew the rotten banks, and devouring the re-
mainder of the bay, 200 yards ahead of the foun-
dered racer, and still aflame with pluck and glory,
took the bush. There the deep sand hove him to,
and he soon slept, snoring.
Back on the beach he wanted to bolt. I dis-
mounted. Jorrocks rolled off his cob.
“ Good Gord ! where did ye get that ’oss ?
What ’oss is he ? ”
The jockey clothed his reeking mount, and
leading it close, stared sulkily at Mystery.
As he gazed, a look, part befogged, part scared,
came into his tomahawk face. Mystery’s saddle-
cloth had rucked. Unbuckling the girths, I was
putting it straight. The jockey, passing the
bridle of his horse to Jorrocks, said quickly,
“ Here, let me, boss ! ” and elbowing me aside,
whipped off the saddle, dropped it, and lifted the
cloth.
Then I saw—l had never noticed it before-
right in the centre of Mystery’s back, on near
side, a queer little white patch, either natural ora
saddle mark. It formed, with but little imagina-
tion, the word DON.
The jockey shot a glance at the mark. “ Gal-
lop ! —why why its I’’ But here he
shut his unpleasant mouth with a snap, and
picked up and girthed the saddle.
“ It’s what ? '’ I asked.
“ A dandy galloper, no arrer, boss,” he grunted,
his head under the saddle-flap. >
“ Tell ye what,” said Jorrocks, “ that ’oss don’t
belong to this country. Leastways, he never
raced here, or I’d know him. More the cut of a
Australian ’oss. Goin’ to race him—a dark un,
eh ? ”
“Not much. Good-day, Jorrocks.”
* » * *
As Mystery became domesticated, he evinced
ingenuity and dry humor. No fastening of the
stable half-door kept him prisoner. He soon
wandered at will all over the place. Once, he
stumped up five wooden steps into the kitchen,
and had to be led, triumphantly on his part, a
large forked carrot between his teeth, through the
house and out of the front door. When he
wanted company, he would rear, put his fore-feet
on a lower window-sill, and glower into the room,
intensely pleased if he scared the occupants. He
did these and other things with the oppressive
melancholy of demeanor of your true humorist.
Hk was a Maoriland mystery, and happened to
me, Thomas Dona, in Dunchureh (M.L.).
m * * *
“An’ what d’ye think of that?” asked the
Vicar-General.
I didn’t think much of it—a hairy, unkempt,
sad-eyed thing, about 15.2, aged, and wearing an
aspect of disrepair and languor, possibly resultant
from early disappointment. Though, taking the
horse in detail, there seemed little fault—bay,
with black points ; legs, flat, clean and strong ;
good head, shoulders and hind-quarters; well
ribbed-up, if slightly puckered. But it was deadly
somnolent, opening its eyes when handled, but
quickly relapsing into torpor. It appeared to be
hybernating.
“ Fit ye like a glove, an’ dir-rt chape,” said the
Vicar-General.
“Y-e-es, father; but it looks—well—laded,
don’t it ? ” I remarked.
“ Been running in the bush ; belongs to a light-
house man, transferred; I’m the keeper of his
conscience. The horse has lived on sand, late
days ; but a trifle corn, a bit av a wisp, and he’ll
shine like the morning glory. Sivin pound tin’s
all the man’s askin’ for him—can gallop and
jump.”
He didn’t look it. He looked like a horse that
could sleep promiscuously, without provocation.
“ Here, Mick ! ” shouted his reverence, “ whip
a saddle on this one; “shore Mr. Dana’ll try
him.”
Mounting, I woke the animal, and with per-
suasion he slouched, gaping, to the high road. I
tried his paces. He was fuller of condensed bump
than a camel —I have ridden commissariat camels.
He didn’t trot, but sprawled and shambled—a
mixture of Parsee run and locomotor ataxy ; can-
tered false and disunited, wouldn’t gallop, had no
mouth, carried his neck stiff as a bowsprit, was
utterly unresponsive to the leg, and less supple
than a butcher’s block.
I took him, however, to please the Vicar-
General. At worst I could sell the thing. And
he appeared sound —if only sound asleep.
Bob, a youthful Ishmaelite stuffed with guile,
who called me “ boss,” took charge of the horse,
and we gave him a loose-box with fattest oats and
sweetest hay money could buy, and expected him
to be astonished at such unwonted richnesses.
He wasn’t. He picked at his rations in a b’as6
way, impertinent in a beast just off sand-diet.
He cast aristocratic glances round his stable as if
disappointed with the absence of marble manger
and silver hayrack, and when clothed at night
yawned with the ennui of a pampered Cup-winner.
He was the most disdainful four-legged thing I
ever met.
Next morning before grooming, the lad, sus-
pecting the horse had never had currycomb or
brush on him in his life, and might play up,
racked him up short. The animal glanced at us,
as one who observes, “Kindly watch me!” reined
back, squatted on his haunches, pulled, burst his
head-stall, stood free, and, smiling faintly, fell
asleep. When the boy took water and hoof-pick
to the horse’s feet, we anticipated further trouble.
But the creature raised his hoofs delicately, as to
the manner born, scrutinising them, when washed,
to see if they were clean. The currycomb
snatched lumps off his dirty coat. He merely re-
garded his groom with chill severity, presenting
such portions of his person as had not received
satisfactory attention. He showed complete
familiarity with every stable implement and with
the profane observations horses of the higher
circles hear from grooms. Bob, who had reckoned
to astonish him, was chagrined.
“Ho ! yaas ; you’re a toney bfoke of a ’orse,
you are ! Bin fed off of gold plate, you ’ave —
you and your bloomin’ old lighthouse man ! But
don’t you put on jam with me, yer darned old
sand-rat, you ! ”
The horse, in reply, simply bit the boy.
“S’elp me, boss, but that ’orse sabees what ye
aye to him, and puts on side, same as if he’d won
the Canterbury Cup, He’s a mystery, that’s wot
,he is ! ”
As “Mystery ” we accepted him, thenceforward
and for ever.
* * • *
Until Mystery’s coat was off, Bob exercised
him, and was not enthusiastic. “ It’s a ’earse,
not a ’orse. There’s more go in a tree-stump.
Thought I’d ’ave to hump ’im home on me back,”
was his vulgar comment.
When I first rode him, he slouched two miles,
then, unasked, turned dogmatically for home. I
slewed him round, rammed both spurs in, and he
went down hill at an alleged trot. At foot thereof
was a sharp turn, and a small white thing,
squatting. I never classified Mystery’s succeed-
ing evolution. It was compounded of buck, shy,
pirouette, pig-jump, cow-buck, and villainies un-
known. When I awoke he grazed superciliously
near my ear—a white poodle (cause of the woe)
barking at his heels. We reached home eventually.
The doctor stuck as much of me together as he
could find.
When repaired, days later, I persuaded Mys-
tery to crawl to a sandy sea bay three miles out.
Thrice, en route, he seemed to desire to die. Im-
mediately, however, he touched hard sand, a
quiver as of electricity went through him, and, to
my astonishment, he danced a stately minuet.
Surprise intensified when he volunteered a springy
canter and actually exhibited a tendency to
gallop. Such agility seemed to signify change
before death -a unique effort, resembling the
swan’s funereal song.
At the head of the bay "old Jorrocks, the trainer,
handled the legs of a raoehorse—a jockey up.
“ Mornin’, Mr. Dana; you’re just in time to
trive this little ’oss o’ mine a gallop down the
bay.”
It was evident he had not always run wild in the
bush, but had been in society.
His strongest suit was a vast inconsistency.
Ordinarily, to ride him on a road was to fore-
taste Sheol, so wooden and sluggish was he.
Despite spurs and whip, he continually halted to
indulge in introspection. Yet, when a party of
us rode twenty miles to a razzle-dazzle at
Tawhai station, he, of his own free will,
lunged into a sweeping rythmical trot,
compelling every other horse to gallop, and
was as silken-mouthed and velvet-paced
as a fat colonel’s first charger. Returning
alone next day his gait was so fiendish that I took
him back to the station and asked them to truck
him home lor me, and went back myself by rail.
The owner of the station kept him a week, and
declared him the cleverest and fastest horse after
stock, and the very vilest roadster he had ever
crossed. Subsequently I lent Mystery to Tim
Hegarty, finest cross-country rider in Maoriland.
Tim hunted him, and made me a big bid for
him—“ Though God help the man who tries to
pull him, once he’s going,” said Tim. But I had
refused even better offers. I’d got interested in
the old horse, and he was something to lie about
while the trout season was off.
“ You know that jock as you ryced in the bay,
boss ? ” said Bob, one day.
“Well?”
“ He’s uncommon chummy with me —shouts
drinks and smokes.”
“ Thought I told you not to smoke and drink,
you young cub ! ”
“He’s got some game on,” said Bob, evading
the side issue.
“ Game ! —how ? ”
“ He’s a Cornstalk; thinks hisself rorty ; wants
me and him to get hold of Mystery and ryce him
on the sly, when you goes away for a holiday.
Thinks he has me on a 'ook. But, boss, he knows
somethin’ about Mystery.”
It had struck me that the jockey and Mystery
had met before, but I didn’t take much stock in
Bob’s yarn. I merely promised to make life ex-
tremely gay for him if I caught him debauching.
Later, Jorrocks told me, incidentally, his jockey
was “ a darned spieler,” and he had sacked him,
and the man had returned to Australia.
* * * *
Weeks after Bob thundered at my bedroom door
at daylight.
* * * •
“ He’s gone—clean gone, sir ! ”
I came out. “ What in thunder are you mak-
ing that racket for, you painful young ass ? ”
“ Mystery’s been stole, boss ! ”
“Be hanged for a yarn ! He’s got out of the
stable on to the road.”
“ No, he ain’t; the door was locked and the key
’ung outside.”
The horse ivas gone. His clothing and head-
cover weiv carefully hung on a peg. In the
manger was a packet—a letter wrapped round a
roll of Bank of New Zealand notes :
“Mr. Dana—Sir, lie was the finest horse in Australia —
no offens hut your a mug as don’t no what to do with a
hors: 1 like that—you won’t Sell, he coss you seven ten,
we pays you 150 pound. We aint Gonopps, we are
strait -we are goin’ to Race Him. if we wins we’ll send
yon a fair divi. If you puts the traps on we shoots your
horse and clears. His Name was young don. You arsk
any speeler or bookie what voung dotyflone.
“ YOung don and co.”
There were fifty good notes in the packet.
* * * *
“Do? Why, nothing,” said Jack Peek, the
lawyer. “The horse cost you seven-ten, and
you’ve got fifty for him. You wouldn’t race him,
and a ten pound hack will serve you better. If
you lay an information the thieves will cook the
horse. You’re well out of it. Young Don won
the big steeplechase at , Victoria, under a
false name. H", his rider, anjl owner were dis-
qualified for life. It is suspected he was run
again under a false name at Dunedin, fifteen
months ago. The owners, probably, after that
sent him to grass to lay dark for a time; he
strayed, and the lighthouse man possibly annexed
him. You can’t prove ownership ; the man you
bought him of and the Vicar-General are both
dead. Keep quiet! Six-and-eightpence, please,
for helping to compound a felony.”
* • » •
Some months after Peek and I took holiday and
went to the great sporting event of the North.
The day of the steeplechase '.ve reached the course
late, and went straight to the tote. Seven
starters ! A pile of lucre on the favorite and
much money on five of the others. Only one,
“ Sluggard,” unbacked. Jack took five tickets on
him. He always hacks one rank outsider for a
steeplechase. Just as he got his tickets a man in
a flurry rushed up and planked a roll of notes—as
he snatched up his tickets and bolted I recognised
him as Jorrocks’old jockey, he of the bay. When
next the machine operated there was .£55 on
Sluggard.
“ That’s queer. Let’s go and see the horses,”
said Jack.
Six horses filed out —a grand lot; the favorite a
magnificent black, of renown.
A roar of laughter ! The jockeys, brilliant of
plumage, on satin horses, were doing preliminary
canters. At tail of all, vainly trying to coax his
sorry-looking mount out of a walk, rode a shabby-
looking fellow in old black silk jacket and cap
and stained cords. His horse, long-haired and ill-
groomed, a seedy bay with three white stockings.
The spectators freely aired their racecourse wit on
horse and rider—the latter described on the card
as “owner.” He looked uncomfortable and
scared,buthumped his back, affecting indifference;
the horse yawned unaffectedly. He was “ Slug-
gard.”
Even as I grinned came enlightenment. “ Holy
sailor! Jack—it’s Mystery.”
“You make me tired!” he said; “Mystery
had black points; that beast has three white
legs.”
“ Can’t a coper bleach a horse’s legs ? Look
here, if he plays up at the post, and I see him
jump, I can swear to him. Come down to the
big jump; there’plenty of time.”
We hurried down, the starter getting his horses
together. The big jump was a terrific affair, of
solid timber. Jack swept the starters with his
field glass. “By Jove ! Sluggard is bucking and
rearing, Dana.”
* • * *
“ They’re away ! ”
In the first few strides Sluggard bounded clear
of his horses, and a roar- part surprise, part con-
temptuous—followed him. “What’s he making
the running for? ” said one of a crowd around the
jump.
“ By the hokey ! but he can lep,” said another,
as Sluggard flew his first jump with feet to spare,
and raced, well ahead of the field, to the next.
“Jumps not too bad, but no horse can last at
that pace; he’ll tail off once-round,” someone
remarked.
But at the same speed and increasing his lead
he took the second jump—the next '.—the next !
and roars of applause came down the wind to us.
And now Sluggard, far ahead of everything,
reached the big jump. The crowd around jab-
bered : “Why don’t the fool collect him?”
“What’s he cracking on like that for ? ” “The
blooming horse has bolted!” “ S’elp me, he’ll
come a cropper ! ”
While they chattered the horse went clear and
high over the timber and, unhandled by his rider,
slowed a little, as one knowing his business and
knowing he had the race in hand. Two things I
noted—the rider was afraid of his horse, and the
horse gathered his legs as I had seen but one horse
do in my life.
“It’s Mystery !” said Peek and I, in one breath.
By this time the field—bar the favorite, going
strong and splendidly ridden, though far astern of
Sluggard—were nowhere. Three had come to
grief, and were out of it, cracked by the tre-
mendous pace.
* * * *
They came for the second round. Sluggard ahead
of the favorite, who was jumping beautifully.
Until just before the big jump, this second
time round, Sluggard had collected his own pace.
Suddenly, however, the favorite, let out, began to
shorten the interval with a great rush. Whether
Sluggard’s rider completely lost his head, or
thought his horse could not last at the pace, he
began to try to hold him. This, and the nearing
sound of the favorite’s hoofs, seemed to madden
Sluggard, who threw up his head and bolted, but
bolted straight. He cleared the jump next before
ours at headlong speed and tore towards the big
timber. As he neared, we saw the rider was
deathly white, could almost fancy we heard his
hard breathing ; his eyes, fixed and staring, were
those of one who sees Death ! Just ere his horse
rose at the leap he swayed back in the saddle and
sawed Sluggard’s mouth with the snaffle.
“ Don’t pull ! For God’s sake let him go!” I
howled.
As I spoke, the bravo horse—was it fancy ?
it seemed that he baulked in the air, turning his
sad eyes in the direction whence came my voice.
The next moment horse and rider lay, an un-
distinguishable mass, on the ground. The horse
rolled over once, the man moved an arm. Then—
both were dead.
No one ever claimed either. Jorrocks’ jockey
disappeared. When the saddle was taken off the
gallant beast, I saw, as I knew I should, the tell-
tale mark, Don, in white hairs upon his back.
That tobacco-box with silver mounts is one of
the horse’s feet—all that is left of one who,
whether Young Don or Sluggard, was, to the last
—Mystery.

[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
Stumpy and I were nigger-punchers on a planta-
tion near Cairns, and as luck would have it we
got the sack on the same day. So we agreed
to chum-in and hump bluey together. Stumpy
was a sailor, and had never been along the track
before. So he was glad to have a mate who knew
how to make johnny-cakes. He was a married
man, too* was Stumpy, and when he said good-bye
to his missus his voice was husky. “ Well, so-
long, old girl; don’t grizzle,” remarked Stumpy.
But she did grizzle, for they had just buried their
youngest child, and they weren’t broken-in to
parting.
The first part of the road from Cairns to Gerald-
ton is right enough. You pass deserted selection
after selection, and in all you can most likely pick
plenty of pine-apples and guavas, or oranges and
limes, according to season. Twenty miles out of
Cairns you get into the scrub, and the road is worse
than the road to hell. That is paved with good
intentions, anyway; but the road through this
scrub is mud from end to end, and ankle-deep at
that. One doesn’t bog in it, though, as in black-
soil mud ; it is too slushy for that.
• * * 9
When we got into the scrub it was raining, but
then it is always raining there, except at rare in-
tervals when there is sunshine for half-an-hour or
so. When the sunshine does come filtering through
those lofty trees, and shines on the lawyer-vine
and stinging-bush, quandong, and wild banana,
lighting up the glories of the multicoloured foli-
age, it makes a scene for gods to gaze at. We
had no time to play at being gods, and anyway
there was too much rain to give our aesthetic
tastes a chance, so we thought of the mud, and
the wet, and the smell of the rotting leaves, and
wished we could change the scrub for the ugliest
stretch of blacksoil plain, or the most hideous
patch of good dry brigalow.
After Stumpy and I had walked the first half-
mile through the scrub, we looked about for a
moderately dry log to sit on, because we wanted
to pull the leeches off. We averaged 15 leeches
apiece for the first half-mile, and kept up the aver-
age fairly well throughout the day. There is no
dodging the leeches. They get on the tips of the
blades of Russell-grass, and sit up on their hind
legs, and stretch out their long, ugly necks, and
feel for you.
It wasn’t long before we came to a gully, six
feet across and four feet deep, with a forty-horse-
power current running. We wasted a lot of time
and bridged it elaborately. Then we crossed, and
wanted to sit down and have a smoke and con-
gratulate each other ; but the tobacco was like
wet blotting-paper, so we gave it best. A few
hundred yards further on we met another gully,
and we bridged that ; but afterwards we let them
rip. We were wet enough as it was, so we splashed
bang through. Gullies seem a bit superfluous on
that road. Some capitalist ought to dig them up
and plant them afresh in the droughty West.
• • • •
We turned out for dinner when we felt that
way, and tried to boil our quarts ; but after using
up a box of matches and much blasphemy they
seemed as much inclined to freeze as boil, so we
gave that best too. The sooner you drop down to
it and give most things best in that country the
better for your peace of mind.
While we were having dinner another swaggie
came along. He was a Frenchman, who told us
that he had run away from his ship in Sydney and
walked overland, but could get no work. “I’m
cook,” says Frenchy, “ I cook in Paris ; one man
tell me he give me job cook at public-house. I
say, ‘What you give?’ He say, ‘Fifteen bob.’
I say, * Sapristi! fifteen bob ! I walk two
tousan mile, and, mychrise ! I walk another two
tousan mile before I work for fifteen bob.”
Then Stumpy told him that we had come from
Burketown, and had been offered a job droving
at three pounds a week apiece. “Think I’d go
droving for three notes a week?” said Stumpy,
“ Not me ! ” Stumpy did not know a horse from
a poley cow, and knew as much about droving as
he knew about French cookery. But it comes
natural to lie on the track.
» * * *
We made thirteen miles that day, and we kept
going too. When we turned out for the night we
made bunks of rotten wood to keep us off the mud.
But we couldn’t get away from the rain. We had
no tent, and perhaps if we had we shouldn’t have
rigged it; we were so utterly and desperately
wretched. While we were rigging our bunks an
angel in disguise appeared to us. He was rather
effectively disguised as a very big blackfellow in a
very small shirt, doubtless intended purely for
ornament, for it made no concession whatever to
decency.
The nigger wanted to cadge some tobacco. So
we told him to chuck himself about and make a
fire. (We could not have made a fire if we had
had ten tinfuls of kerosene and a hatful of
matches). Then we knew that the nigger had been
appointed by Providence to keep us from suicide.
He emptied a tin match-box ; struck.a light; and
laid the match back in the box again. Then he
split a piece of lawyer-cane into thin,strips and
laid them transversely across the flame. Then he
put the box on the ground and piled bigger bits of
cane on. He got a fire at last that was 98 per
cent, smoke ; so we gave him a square feed and
enough trade-tobacco to last him a week.
• '* » »
We crossed the Russell River next day.
Stumpy, being a sailor, knew how to make a raft;
so we got our swags over dry—or, at any rate, as
dry as they were before, which is not saving
much. From the Russell to Goondi the road is
pretty thick with deserted selections. It is no
wonder the poor cockles chuck ’em up. One un-
fortunat6 woman, condemned for her sins to live
i r °fV old us , thafc she had not been able to
j lirLr ° t « l « e xr ln open air between Ootober
w , Ye ?» she said, “ it’s a bit off. We
naa J 65 inches of ram last year. But we’d get
used to it if it wasn’t for the ague, and the John-
stone River fever.”
I got fever-and-ague myself next day. We
camped m a deserted humpy on the strength of it,
anC i*. US i spare slabs for firewood. I was
pretty bad—couldn’t kneel up straight to mix the
dough for the johnny-cake—had to lean against
le wall while I was doing it. Of course there
wasn t any table.
Stumpy walked back four miles through the
mud and rain to get me some quinine from the
woman who couldn’t dry clothes. She had run
out of quinine, but recommended painkiller.
Stumpy brought me back a bottle, and I took a
~A n h « ur afterwards I felt my pulse and
then threw the painkiller as far as I could see it.
xet the advertisement said it was good for fever
and ague ; but then the advertisement cracked it
up for anything from cholera and snakebite to
seasickness and delirium-tremens. Stumpy said
we had better save the advertisement sheet and
use it for an umbrella; he reckoned it might per-
haps be good for rain.
* * • *
We went on to Goondi as soon as I could travel,
and asked for work. I didn’t get put on, but
Sturnpy did We turned out all our pockets, and
u V 6 j d a shilling between us. So we went
and had a drink, and Stumpy swore he would keep
me till I got a job.
There was a steamer at the Goondi wharf, un-
loading machinery. I walked on board and took
the precaution to ask the skipper where his next
port was. Dungeness,” said he. “Thank
God . said Ito myself. Then I put my swag
down on the deck and sat on it. As soon as we
had sheered off the wharf I went and told the
captain I was “stiff,” and asked him to let me
work my passage down to Dungeness. He
played the deuce at first, and swore he’d put me
in gaol as soon as he got to Townsville. I told
him he would lose by it, and he rather thought so
too. At least, he knew he’d nothing to gain by
it ; and he wasn’t a bad sort ; so he started me at
work, and kept me at it for 15 consecutive hours.
Considering the fare was half-a-erown, I reckoned
1 earned my passage.
There were three steerage-passengers besides
myself two Malays and a Chow—and we had
tucker with the sailors. It was an informal
meal. Ihe cook put before us a loaf of bread, a
bucket of tea, a dish of salt beef, and a fistful of
pannikins, and said, “ Now then, chaps, wire-in !”
There weren’t enough pannikins to go round, and
the Chinaman was the first to grab one. One of
the sailors knocked it out of his hand and said,
xou get some manners, will yer, yer yeller !
and wait till a Christian’s finished.” At night we
spread out our blankets on the deck and slept the
sleep of the hard-up.
Dungeness is not the largest seaport town in
Australia. It is built on a sand-ridge sur-
rounded by mangrove-swamp. There are three
houses in the town, one of which is a pub. and an-
other the Custom House. The third is probably
the Town-hall. There used to be a wharf at Dun-
geness once, but it was swept away by the flood,
and the residents never had energy or influence
enough to get another built. When the steamers
get near enough to the shore they hook a rope on
to a tree and pull themselves up with a winch
unless the tree comes up by the roots first.
• * * *
Two opposition river-boats were waiting to take
passengers up the Herbert. The smartest man
got aboard first, and seeing I had my swag ready,
lequested me as a personal favour to accompany
him. I conceded the favour. When he landed
me at Halifax, and I told him he would have to
wait for his five bob because I was stone-broke, he
wanted to fight me. I gently reminded him that
it was at his special request I came in his boat.
Then I saddled up Matilda and started along the
track. I got a job next day, and on the same day
heard from Stumpy’s missus. The first day
Stumpy went to work he dropped down and was
carried out from the mill into the hospital. John-
stone River fever.

The Cradle of Blue.
Eyes alight and young gold hair,
Dimpled chin and cherry-red lip !
Little pink-fisted mariner,
A-rock and a-rock in your cradle ship,
Where do you think you’re sailing to ?
‘Goo,” the mariner says, and “ Goo,
Goo, Goo, Goo, ” with a merry lip,
A-rock and a-rock in her cradle ship.
O, the seas are calm and blue
And the skies with light aglow
Down in the land of Goo, Goo, Goo,
Where the baby captains go;
A cradle fleet’s upon the sea
Sailing on with gurgling glee,
By Isles of Nod and Lands of Rest
North by South and East by West.
But at times ! at times ! at times 1
(Still your sobs and dry your eyes)
And (’tis best) forget the rhymes,
Baby rhymes that cling and rise,
A small .blue craft with gilding sweet
Winds slowly through the cradle fleet,
And all the babies cry “ Goo, Goo,”
But that’s not the port it’s sailing to.
Why did she leave her cradle ship
All for the sake of a craft of blue ?
Who stole the red from the baby’s lip ?
Stilling her song of “Goo, Goo, Goo.”
Only this : She danced her curls,
Said “I’ve heard of a Land of Pearls,
And I’ll steer my cradle North by South
And get some pretties to put in my mouth. ”
She set a-sail on a perilous main,
East by West and North by South,
Through Sleepless Straits and Isles of Pain,
And strong Thirst Winds that scourged her
mouth,
And dank sick dews that deadened her curls,
Till she oame at last to the Land of Pearls
And took two tiny ones—only two —
When her cradle gave place to a craft of blue.

Dead Roses.
They lie in dim corners with dust on the leaves,
Each withered brown bloom with the story it
weaves
Of sweethearts and sorrow, of doubt and despair;
A gift from her girdle, a prize from her hair;
The rose that he gave her the night they first met;
Her rose, when they parted, with warm tears all
wet—
Dead roses ! Dead roses ! of grief and regret.
Some carelessly clustered, some twined with silk
thread
Where dear hands have bound them, brown
wreaths for the dead.
No dew-fall to reach them, no sunlight to cheer,
But the warmth of a hand or the rain of a tear;
And some, and the saddest, the lorn and the lost
Of the loves long forgotten, the spiders have
crossed ...
Dead roses ! Dead roses ! the tears ye have cost!
They wait in dim corners, and vainly they wait—
These blossoms of Sorrow, these garlands of Fate;
The oldest but yearly laid bare to the sight,
And the new ones kissed madly each morning and
night;
Wild whispers unspoken ; rash loves unconfessed;
The end that was bitter, the end that was best.
Dead roses! Dead roses ! Lay mine with the rest!

On the Cliff.
Come, let us rest, and watch the flowing ships,
Here, where your foot has touched a shivering
stone
To leave the merry sunshine for eclipse;
Down, down for ever, darkened and alone,
Beneath the cozening ripples, smooth and cool—
What’s Life, but a poor stone flung in a pool ?
The lying waves have lapped it—oh! poor stone,
Earth has no dearer sight than a warm sea,
Braided with isles, forgetting the far moan
Concealed in the mid-ocean’s agony.
But. dear, there lie beneath these shallow waves
Christ knows how many unattended graves.
The waves are all about us, we are one
With the unstable waters and the tides,
Symbols of ever wavering threads bespun
By Fate that never in a mood abides.
We leave a fretful image here, or go
Without a fateful scion—better so.
We know the measure of a molten star,
We weigh the rapture of the rushing wind,
Unweave the light—but know not what we are,
Nor whose the fetters that intently bind;
Why we do sorrow, joy, or smile, or weep,
Scatter a little fragrance, then a sleep.
If I were as a shell upon the beach,
The virgin calyx of voluted flowers,
The utter magic of a song to teach
Sorrow a solace in belated hours,
I should be more than I can ever be ;
Beggared of doubt, nor wistful all to see.
So be it ! Dearest, watch the great sun die,
In marvellous thunder to our ears unknown,
Music of equal planets that do lie
In the full plane of knowledge—we are thrown
By a capricious hand —the wise, the fool —
Like a poor stone that’s flung into a pool.

Pain-girt she stood and cried aloud —
I heard the sea.
In agony her strong head bowed—
Dew sprinkled me.
Night’s red lips turned to east from west,
Her right hand drew them to her breast,
Her fair full breast —again the dew :
(I thought of you).
She sighed content—l heard the breeze,
Its rustling banners all unfurled.
Below a wanderer’s smoke upcurled
And amorous sought the quivering trees.
She smiled, Morn-Mother, victory won,
And oped her eyes—l saw the Sun.

To-morrow ?
Nay, I shall not fear —this is to-night—
Nor sorrow.
Beside thee kneels thy son—first mine, then thine.
Amid the gloom thy face gleams white,
Nor need we light
If thou but ope thine eyes—so shall mine shine.
Ihy lips shew not where, moaning, mine have
pressed.
The arms that folded lie upon thy breast
Stretch forth, Beloved 1 for thou thou art not
dead . . .
Yet still, so still! Thy restless head
Burrowed the pillow ere but one hour sped.
Beloved ! ever didst thou love the night ....
Sleep on ! I will not sorrow—
This is to-night—nor fear to-morrow.

I Was Afraid.
I.
How could you, Love, accuse me in such wise,
That I was cold and loved myself the best !
When all my life was leaping toward your eyes,
And all my body ached to be caressed
By your strong hands and supple, clinging mouth;
O hot fierce fire that needs must be denied !
0 bosom-hills that suffer in the drouth
Of dry cold solitude, but would be bride
Of his breast-heaven that should be over you !
O longing limbs and passionate red rose
That is my heart—are ye not lovers true ?
Is the pain tenser that his body knows ?
Nay, ours is greater—with an added pain,
His bitter coldness, bitterer disdain.
ii.
Yet I denied you. In the sudden thrill
Of passion, waked beneath your burning kiss,
Before my strength all left me, my quick will
Cried, Halt! rash girl, remember only this—
The love thou cravest he will never give,
Who loves thee easily and without care.
Remain still lonely, or in future live
i Remote from him who is thy sweet despair,
lliis is a man, and though his heart is white
And his life stainless, and his eyes as clear
As the twin stars thou prayest to at night,
He will not love thee, finding that more’dear
He is to thee than all thy treasures. So
Women will tell thee—surely women know 1
in.
And I 1 listened, though my pulses leapt
And the blood cried to reach you and make,
known
The flame-filled life in it that forward swept
From heart to brain and quivering fine-wrought :
throne
Of sense and fire that burned to welcome you.
Though my skin tingled and my muscles tense-
Shouted their Aves, and wild lightnings through,
My stretched nerves tore. The overwhelming
sense
Of you, and naught but you, made my heart fail.
nd then—the ghastly fear of losing you
Gripped, as a frosty hand a rose, the frail
And passion-broken heart of me. There blew
Winds of will through me, so that I had strength
Even to resist you strongly and at length.
IV.
And did you think, Love, that I loved you less
Because I thus withheld my wealth from you?
Seemed it your mouth had wasted the caress,
The flame-edged kiss ? Ah, surely, Love’ you
knew
I love you with my heart and mind and soul,
My sense and spirit! But I love you so
I could not live without you, for the whole
Of life lives in you and with you would go.
And surely, Love, my love for you is good
You would lose faithful worship, losing me I
Then say not I am selfish, I who would
Spend all my life to serve you worthily.
This thing alone to lose I cannot bear—
Hope of your love, the Flower my heart would
wftar.

A Difference of Four.—A Sketch
from Life.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
Zack Greentree had been born in the district.,.;
had never been 20 miles away, had not wanted to;
go. “What was the good?” When the. gold"
fever of the fifties had caught his neighbors, arid
drained away the scant population, he had con-
tinued contentedly to split shingles and draw
them to Goree ; and when, in later times, the use
of iron spoiled the shingle - trade, he took to
fencing; and, that work slack, cultivated two
acres of orchard and garden. He was counted the
smartest hand at mortising a post in those parts,
and he felt great pride in the fact. He owned
half-a-dozen mortising-axes of different sizes and
as sharp as razors, that he guarded and tended
jealously and would lend to no man. Yet, the
total of his work was small; a job had to be within
walking distance, and the timber must be good,
and so much time was lost sharpening his tools,
for at the least bluntness of saw or axe work had
to wait till it was remedied. Then there were
days set apart for cultivating his garden, and in
no case to be trenched upon ; and he must be paid
every week for the work done, even if the amount
was but a few shillings. All these causes, acting
together, hindered progress. His father had left
him the humpy of bark and slab, with doors for
windows, stools for seats, and the good hard earth
for carpet. He made no change. It is true, when
he married Sarah Greentree, his cousin, he pur-
chased two chairs ; but he was never comfortable
Beated on them, and their buying was a lasting
regret.
There were six children, and he met theircoming
without a welcome; certainly his eyes never
brightened to them as they would at the sight of
his mortising-axes. The wife was a thrifty woman
with some of his own peculiarities. Their court-
ing had seemed strange to others, not to them-,
selves. Wichout preliminaries, he had stopped
her one day as she passed and he was leaning over
the fence.
“ Sarah ! ”
“What’s the trouble, Zack?”
“ I’m thinking we’d best make a match of it?”
“ I don’t care if I do, Zack.”
“Well, go home and put your bonnet on, and
I’ll harness up the mare.”
And straightway they drove into Goree and
were married ; but housekeeping together was
deferred for a month till Zack had purchased the
chairs before-mentioned.
For years their life was as monotonous as their
bush surroundings, save a storm of words at each
meal, he finding fault and she repaying him three
words to his one. The children, as soon as they
could run, took to the scrub like rabbits, and, at
the rare time a stranger passed that way, would
peep out from behind stumps and bushes, staring
open-mouthed.
One memorable meal-time the customary dis-
pute had for text a pound of tea Zack had brought
thome from town.
“I’m sure it’s not a pound,” said the wife;
‘you ought to have known better.”
“ It’s a good twelve ounces.”
“Well, twelve ounces ain’t a pound; any fool
knows that.”
“ I say twelve ounces is a pound ; I see it in a
book.”
“ Rubbish ! Ain’t I weighed butter ever since I
was a girl ? Sixteen ounces, I tell you, you obsti-
nate man.”
“Twelve ounces; I see it in a book. How
should you know—you can’t spell ? ”
“Sixteen ounces before the world. Why, you’re
daft, man! ”
“ I’ll never speak another word to you till you
say it’s twelve.”
And he never did, from that time forth, and
there commenced in the four-roomed humpy a
strange housekeeping. Zack occupied two rooms
with the three boys, Sarah two with the girls;
the kitchen was common property, fire-place and
table being divided. Each cooked meals on
half the fire, spread them on half the table, and
for 20 years faced each other in silence. When
they had occasion to speak to each other, the man
might say, “ Jabe, ask your mother for half-a-
pound o’ sugar, and here’s the money"; or the
WON BY A PIMPLE!
The biker educates his chin forward so that he may, on emergency, be like the
horse which won by a tongue.
“I’LL GIVE YOU A DROP, OLD MAN, IF I NEVER GET THERE!”
woman would say, “Lesh, take this sixpence and
ask your father to cut some wood.” And, like as
not, both parents would be present during such
speaking.
The purse was divided with the utmost strict-
ness, and, according to returns, not unfairly.
Zack’s earnings from fencing were not large, nor
did his garden add greatly to his income, though
he sold fruit and vegetables to his wife. Sarah
was a clever needle-woman, working regularly for
a store in Goree; and she had well-tended cows
and poultry. On her weekly journey to the town-
ship she drove one cart, Zack another. There was
a fixed tariff for the making or mending of the
male clothes, terms strictly cash. And they so
far respected each other that there was never any
haggling over the heap of wood chopped for six-
pence or the patches and darns put on for three-
pence.
After some years, a new parson came to Goree,
and, hearing of this strange household, with the
energy of untarnished zeal ventured to drive over
to the Greentrees’ on a mission of peace. Zack
was in his garden.
“Good-day, friend ! Are you Mr. Greentree? ”
“I’m Zackriah Greentree,” said the man, look-
ing up suspiciously.
“I am the new minister in charge at Goree; I
hope you will be able to come to our service. The
distance is long, I know ; but for bush residents
that can hardly be helped.”
“ That means money, don’t it ? I never seen a
stranger come round here speaking civil but what
it meant money. And I ain’t got none to spare?”
“No, friend, believe me, I am not after money;
it is my simple duty to my Master to strive
to promote piety and friendliness amongst
those commit-
ted to my
charge. You
have, I hear,
a sad estrange-
ment in your
household ;suf-
fer me to say a
word in season
to you and to
your wife, so
that, God will-
ing, peace may
return to you
and yours.”
“ Why, she
says there’s 16
ounces to a
pound, an’ I
know it’s 12—I
see it in print.”
“ There are
16 o unces, ,
friend. Your
wife is right—
that is, accord-
ing to com-
mon weight.
There are also ;
12 ounces to a
pound apothe-
caries’ weight
—that is the
chemists’—so
yon are right
also. You are
both right.”
“Ah ! I see
the sort o’man
you are— a
kind o’ Mr.
Facingbothways. I’ve heard tell o’ your sort
—run with ther dogs an’ hop with ther wallaby.
No you don’t! I may be a Bushee, but I’m not a
greenhorn. An’ you expect me to believe, if Igo
to ther store for a pound o’ soda, I gets 16 ounces,
an’ if I goes ter ther chemist’s I gets 12 ! It’s not
sense, man ! Go away with ver foolishness ! ” and
Zack. turned resolutely to his digging.
* * * *
The years passed. The children, growing-up,
drifted away, only one girl being left to act as
transmitter between her parents. The old man
sickened, and would neither go to, nor, later on,
when going was past question, send for a doctor.
“ What’s ther good o’ trying ter cheat ther
gravedigger ? When ther slip-rails is down I’ll
go straight through, I’m not ther sort ter dodge
along trier fence trying ter find er broken panel.”
At his last extremity, Granny Stiles, who had
come to nurse him, strove to make peace between
the old couple, and brought in Sarah to her hus-
band’s bedside. “Now, do ’e make it up, like
sensible critters: it’s just terrible to be dying with
ill-feeling.”
“Well, I’m willin’: I’ve alius been willin’,”
said the wife ; “ but foolishness I can’t abide.
He’ll never make me say what’s not true.”
_Zack was speechless, but he seemed to hear, for
his eyes turned to his wife defiantly as he feebly
held up his spread fingers, making ten, then fold-
ing his hands, two further fingers, making twelve.
“ Lord a mercy on us, Granny, did yer see
that ! Is there any fool like an old fool ? ”
Even as she spoke, the old man’s fingers were
spread again in last and final protest.
In less than a month Granny Stiles and a neigh-
bor were called in to perform the last sad rites for
Sarah, the wife, whose end had been sudden and
unexpected.
“ I says as much,” said Granny reflectively,
“ when we laid ther old man out: she won’t be
long er following him—yer see, there was no one
left ter aggrivate her, so she just moped about an’
died.”
HENRY FLETCHER.
“Bobdick.”
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
That was his English name; I don’t mean his
early-English name, for that had long been lost.
At “ the tunnel,” one white man had called him
“ Bob,” and another, “ Dick,” and the clever
savage welded the two into “Papatiki,” from
which the pakeha adapted “ Bobdick.”
He didn't care if they called him by a dog’s
name. He had lost his identity, although he had
still ditn recollections of another earthly existence
purified by baths, and music, and pictures, and
good clothes and good women : in places smirched,
perhaps, with little dirt-spots of bad women.
He was a virile fellow then, and his virility, his
red corpuscles, his animalism, hiselmZ, had driven
him from anaemic society to herd witli savages.
He was still herding. He herded with Polly, when
family relations were not strained, and he had,
under her influence, and various other, become a
splendid specimen of the “ terrible example a
dumb preacher of damnation to profligacy. His
old virility had oozed out of him in unscientific
debauchery, till at the age of forty he was the
possessor of a wasted body (wobbling near paraly-
sis), and of a soul guttering-out like a tallow
candle—with dirty, smoky flickers and bad smell.
His eyes were red with whare smoke and whisky
and Polly, and the muscles of expression in the
lower part of his face had grown lax till the
mouth had got an irresolute look, like the furtive
eyes and the trembling hands.
Pie was lying on a flax mat on the whard floor,
occasionally drinking bad whisky from a dirty
pannikin ; between whiles cursing, and between
whiles sighing, all in the glimmering light of his
candle. For Bobdick didn’t like the dark.
He was in his bush residence. The trees, spread
all around him, strove to say unutterable things.
Stupid owls were crying ** moke-poke,” “ moke-
poke ” with devilish persistency.
When he was at home with Polly, Bobdick
lived in a board-built house with an iron roof—a
roof he could hear the rain falling on, and yet
dream lascivious dreams to the sound of it. But
here ! Bobdick cursed the muted toe-toe thatch
that killed the sound. It is awful to know that
it is raining, but not by the hearing of the ear.
Bobdick wanted the rain-sounds, but the night
only gave him moke-poke and frog-music. How
the frogs did chant ! Some of the loud-voiced
almost startled Bobdick. Several times he
fancied they were indulging in a mad haka before
invading his whare, to kill him with the toma-
hawk he had left sticking in a stump just outside.
He was wishing hard now that he had brought it
inside, when a bullock floundered into the swamp
and the frogs shut tight. But the bullock got
out —and the frogs began their horrible din again.
Polly, he thought, was asleep in the board built
house. And the child ? Yes, Polly had a child !
—a dear little girl-kiddie. Bobdick often
claimed an interest in her, and as often disputed
his parentage. The fact is, Bobdick was
jealous concerning Polly. She had that treacher-
ous black blood that is beyond understanding in
its moral or immoral or non-moral pulsations.
Bobdick guessed he would watch Polly, and
drank more whisky; and the more whisky he
drank the more he guessed he would watch. So
the night passed, and the next day, and the
watching time came.
* * f t
Bobdick was outside the board-built house.
It was still dark, and it rained. There was a
light, and Polly’s shadow occasionally crossed the
window-blind as she unrobed. Bobdick fancied
he saw another shadow, which was not the shadow
of Polly’s child, nor the shadow of any of Polly’s
feu-ale friends.
They say a pakeha can become just as jealous of
an unwashed, ill-shapen, black-skinned woman as
he can of a woman with a nice, white, sweet-
smelling, well-washed, not to say scented, skin.
It still rained. Bobdick was sure of the
other shadow. Around the house ran a high wire
fence the wires close together. Bobdick
started to climb it, wire by wire. At the top, his
foot slipped, and caught between the first wire
and the second. He fell back, and hung. It
still rained, and a little stream ran down Bob-
dick’s leg, and swelled, and spread itself like an
irrigation system. Bobdick had his back to
the window now, and could not see shadows. But
he imagined them ; and saw snakes occasionally
darting across, his field of vision.
Somebody snicked a wire through in the gray of
the dripping dawn. Bobdick stole cautiously
into the house. Polly was, to all appearance,
sound asleep. Bobdick picked up Polly’s
child, and carried it out. He laid its head on a
wood-block, and, with one chop, cut it off. He
didn’t look to see that there was only sawdust
where there should have been blood He had for-
gotten about the big doll he had bought for Polly’s
child, on the occasion of one of his rare trips to
town, when distance had made him charitable.
Something must have alarmed Polly, for she
now came out with a blanket about her. Bob-
dick proceeded to finish his morning’s work. He
called Polly sweet Maori love-names until he gob
near enough to rush at her with his axe. But
Polly had guessed things. She darted off, and
just succeeded in getting inside the door when the
axe lit deep into the wood of it. Then a fighting
Hebrew came from somewhere and sat on Bobdick’s
chest.
lie rallied sufficiently only to be able to tell us
that it was not the rain he minded, or the cold, or
the hanging, but the thought of Polly chumming
with a shadow. He tried to connect the shadow
with the Hebrew, and thought seriously of getting
up an anti-Semitic movement, but he was too tired.
Bobdick is now sleeping or squirming in his
place beside the immortal damned—the black, un-
washed damned—and Polly is another man’s
Polly.

Margaret.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
Margaret Olsen’s Sea-love was a legacy from
Norse forbears. Day and night she haunted the
great beach on the northern coast. The sands
and foam and pale grasses linked her to a race of
sea rovers. The tide talked to her as she went
barefoot on the sands, and the wind played with
her long hair. The waves crashing on the rocks
or sluicing in the weeds hinted far, familiar
things. Her soul had celled the music of the sea,
and salt was in her blood.
She bathed often, and the waves played about
her like amiable dogs. Cooper, of the saw-mills,
glimpsing through tea-trees, saw her one sunset
on a shoal, and the sight spelled him. Margaret
came on shore and dressed. Till she went away
swinging her hat he kept his place—silent and
thrilled with a sweet sense of guilt. He returned
home with drowsy, splendid eyes, and kept a
secret for many months. At length an artist
came to the district, and Cooper gave him a sub-
ject. Cooper’s eyes, however, said so much more
than his tongue that the story seemed pale beside
the teller. The artist said he would do his best.
But, when he returned to town, he did not paint
the ivory figure standing in a curve of pearl, with
purple sea for a background. He painted Cooper’s
face, and called the picture, “ When a Man Sees
God.”
* * * *
One day, Violet, the daughter of Cooper, sat
with Margaret on a rock. Margaret’s feet were
in the cool water.
“How brown your feet are, Margaret!” said
Violet.
Margaret splashed the water till the sand
churned up and colored it to cream.
“ I like them so,” she answered.
“But no one will marry you with feet of that
color, ” said Violet.
Margaret laughed.
“Men do not see our feet till it is too late,” she
replied.
“ And the salt has made your hair coarse,” said
Violet; “ your hair that was soft as silk.” Violet’s
fingers played with her friend’s hair as gently as
little breezes.
“I love swimming,” said Margaret.
POINTS OF VIEW.
THE MAN: “I say, hasn't the new model a jolly
fine figure? ”
THE WOMAN: “I don't know; I have not seen her
with her clothes on !”
Then they were silent, and Violet’s mind went
to please itself with a dream of dresses, of delicate
laces and silks with a sheen in them to cheat the
gaze at every movement. But Margaret turned
her "face to sea, and the vision made her eyes
large.
* » • »
One night, as Margaret lay abed, a great south
gale knocked at the walls of her home. The wind
came up in gusts that drowned the Sea’s song.
Between the gusts she heard the Sea.
She turned on her side and tried to sleep, but the
change had brought restlessness. The night was
charged with clamour; and she desired to cry out,
to add another note to the many noises. The old
Sea worked in her blood.
Suddenly heavy boots sounded outside, and
someone knocked at the door. Sitting up, she
listened. Cooper talked to her father :
“On the outer shoal—breaking fast! ”
“ Good God ! ” said Olsen, “I’ll be with you in
a second.”
Margaret had never seen a wreck, though she had
many times desired the sight. Mariners were
careful and ships kept far a-sea. She rose and
dressed, and followed the two men, stepping
stealthily and trembling. Where the street
met the sand they were joined by others.
Some carried ropes and some lanterns. Mar-
garet did not mingle with the group, but
came after at a safe distance. Her father was a
stern man and might order her to go home. Then
. the strange yearning that was in her to see the lion
rend the lamb would be disappointed.
The sand whipped up and cut her face. She
lowered her head, its crown to the wind, and her
hair blew all about her. It was high tide, and
Margaret knew that on the hither side of the shoal
the undertow would be running mightily. It
would net the legs of the strongest swimmer in
green meshes and take him under like a sponge.
Then he would go out—out —out—and presently,
at turn of tide, come in again and roll over and
over in the white turmoil like a cedar log which
had slipped from a ship at sea. And when the
tide tired of the body, it would say to the land,
“Take this dead thing and bury it.”
* * * *
At length they neared the Sea. It had arisen
to a white wall that fell and rose and tumbled.
The dark was intense, and the water raged so that
the men nearest the breakers shouldered those
farther away, fearing the fury near their feet.
They walked in a level line, the timidest keeping
well inshore: those next the sea alert, with
nervous, sidelong looks. At times one would turn
his lantern on the waves and go closer, because it
was easier walking at the sea-line. But this posi-
tion was seldom held long. A white mass that
hurled itself landward would send the venturer
hying across the track of his fellows like a startled
hare. A sense of uncertainty as to the Sea’s
power, as to the length of its wet arm, troubled
them all.
They came to the north end of the beach and
paused. They grouped close, and a man pointed
out to sea, indicating the scene of wreck. Mar-
garet came nearer and looked too. She saw
nothing but white-breasted waves ; heard nothing
but the Sea’s roar. A man in the group cried out.
The Sea thundered. The man, feeling ashamed of
the little noise he had made, turned to a neighbor
to see if he laughed. He might have spared him-
self the trouble ; his neighbor had not heard him.
Then Olsen shouted to Cooper that they should
all bellow in one voice. Cooper wondered why
Olsen had whispered, but agreed. Together they
shouted and waved their lanterns in the wind. It
seemed to each man that his voice went no farther
than his lips, and a sense of impotence fell upon
all. They stood with uplifted lanterns, pale and
a-shiver, and listened to the overbearing Sea.
Cooper went forward and peered in the surf. A
wave washed in and he ran back, but when the
wave retreated he chased it and trod its white
skirts. A moment after a second wave pursued
him to his former position. Then he beckoned to
the group, and all together, as opportunity offered,
they hurried forward and saw a great beam black
in the foam. It had been torn from a ship’s side,
and told
all.
A ft e r
this they
moved to
and fro
restless-
ly, like
lions be-
hind bars.
One man
shook his
fist at the
Sea, and
did not
care who
saw him.
A second
sat upon
the sand,
his hands
clenched about his
knees, and chewed
his underlip. A
third put his fingers
m his ears and cried
out, deeming that in such
manner he could shut other
ears to all noises but his own.
At length the Sea’s insolence
became unbearable, and Cooper
and Olsen moved away. “It is
of no use,” they muttered, “we
will come at morning.” One by one,
in dejected succession, the rest strung off
behind them. In this wise they moved home-
ward ; and they might have seen Margaret stand-
ing a few paces to one side had not the blown sand
lowered their eyelids, making them stumble
blindly.
• * * *
When they were gone Margaret bared her
throat to the rude wind and walked the beach.
Now that she was alone she thrilled strangely.
Her eyes filled with sights; her ears heard many
noises. She saw white ships, with every canvas
set, sailing to their doom. Nearer, these were
changing to flying breakers. She heard noises as
of strong men swimming, as of drowned men
gurgling, as of dead men soughing. But again
she was disappointed, for the Sea has many under-
tones.
* * * *
The dawn showed Margaret looking in amaze on
a still figure at her feet. It'was a man half-naked,
with arms outstretched to their full length. This
was the Sea’s gift, she thought; a great gift sent
for her delight. His curls were yellower than the
wet sand. Margaret felt half sorry that he was
dead. Then on a sudden she bent down and her
hand sought his heart. Her own heart reddenod
with hope. She beat his hands and rubbed his
bare chest, and when the Sea sent a wave to feel
about him she lifted him beyond its reach. Then
she ran to tell men of her find and to bring help.
When he opened his eyes Margaret saw deeper
blue than the Sea’s blue. He talked to her, and
the Sea’s voice sounded far-off and faint. All in a
moment Sex had effaced Heredity ; the Sea had
given place to the Man.
•* * » •
Thereafter the man dwelt in the district, and
worked at the saw-mills where Olsen was overseer.
By day he fed the spinning circle that hummed
like a great bee ; at night he went to Olsen’s house
and played cards with Margaret.
She was changed now, and walked no more
barefooted. The Sea saw her seldom. She washed
her brown hair free of salt till its silkiness re-
turned. Her cheeks that the sun had browned
ADULTERATION IN BOORIOBOOLA GHA.
INDIGNANT CUSTOMER: “Look here! You sold me this for genuine
tinned Missionary, and see what I found in it—the hack tooth
of a horse! And you had the cheek to charge me two dog's
teeth and six boars' Lusks for it! ”
she made pale with powder. Her splendid form
that the Sea had moulded, rolling her in its arms,
she cooped in studied garments.
A west wind blew the shoal away, and she did
not notice. A north wind heaped it high again,
but that was nothing to her. The sea’s face might
change as it listed; it was another face which
Margaret watched. At the close of a wild day
news went through the town that a vessel drifted
towards the rocks at the south end of the beach.
In old days this would have filled Margaret with
a fierce yearning. Now, all night she prayed for
the schooner’s safety, and did not sleep till it was
told her that the lamb had eluded the lion.
* * * *
“ You are quite a lady ! ” said Violet Cooper, as
they walked from church one Sunday.
Margaret blushed, remembering her hoyden
days.
“ You do not go barefoot now, Margaret! ”
The blush deepened, and Margaret tilted her
chin.
“ One cannot be young always,” she said.
Violet laughed lowly—a wise laugh that inti-
mated many things.
“ Then it is because you are getting older, and
not through Mr. . . . ? ”
“ Hush ! ” said Margaret; “he is coming ! ”
He paused before them and looked at Margaret’s
brown face, and at the pale face beside her. But
on which his eyes rested longest, Margaret, full of
faith, did not notice.
* * * *
She visited the great city in the summer, and
realised that she was not kin with its people. The
pale, perpetual smile that she met pained like a
falsehood. Women talked; and she looked into
her own heart, marvelling at their artificiality.
Men smiled and sought her, but she thought of
the half-naked, yellow-haired, young giant the sea
had given her. And thus things went till she met
a friend from her native place.
“ Have you heard the news ? ”
“ No ” —Margaret had not heard any news.
“Well, just think! Violet Cooper is to be
married! ”
“ Married ! ” said Margaret. “To whom ? ”
“I forget—a romantic match—quite romantic
they say, but I forget his name.” And she bade
good-bye.
“ Married ! ” thought Margaret. “To whom ? ”
She stood in the street by a window, and the
people went up and down, one man staying to
look with longing eyes in her face. Suddenly a
suspicion swept across
her brain. All the pale
and painted faces in the
street rushed back from
her as when a mirrored
door swings wide. The
rattle of the traffic
dimmed as if by distance,
and for one moment it
seemed to Margaret that
the Sea sang on a beach.
She left the city on the
following day, and the
little vessel which carried
her home carried also a
woman who told her all
she cared to know. The
blood left Margaret’s
cheeks ; but she did not
faint or weep. She
brooded and turned her
face to the Sea, asking
questions. And it seemed
to her that the Sea an-
swered truly.
* * *
It was evening when
she reached home. She
hardly spoke. Her father
said she looked tired,
and sent her to her bed-
room. She lifted her
window and looked out
upon the Night. The
Sea sang in the dis-
tance a low, deep song—
a wooer’s song it seemed.
Stars were everywhere.
Their light was on the
water in flakes and silver
trails; on the land in a
luminous mist ; and in
the wetness on Margaret’s
underlashes.
She did not sleep that night, yet she was not
restless. The murmur and starriness filled her
with a dark calm. At length the dawn came in
a red rubble of cloud, and seabirds clamored on
the beach.
Later Margaret dressed and went out. The
northern headland was afire, and a westerly wind
drove the flames seaward. Margaret came to
Violet’s home, and entered.
“ When will it be ? ” she said.
Violet was dressing her hair; she looked over
her shoulder and nodded.
“ I am glad you came,” she said.
But Margaret did not smile.
“ When will it be ? ” she repeated.
“To-morrow,” said Violet.
Margaret turned and walked to the door.
“ I wish you joy ! ” she said, and with a sob
passed out.
On her way up the street she met Cooper. He
saluted, and made as if to stop. She went by
without a notice. He said afterwards that her
large eyes betrayed no recognition, seeming to
look down strange distances.
* * * *
That night a red headland burned on the coast.
To the captain of a passing vessel it seemed a
veritable phalanx of fire wedging the dark. For
Cooper it was a valuable lure attracting the fish to
its neighborhood. Therefore he went down to
the rocks and cast his lines in the glowing Sea.
An hour afterwards Margaret came along the
beach. Her hair was loose and her feet bare.
She walked slowly.
The Sea was wine-tinted. The surf spread along
the beach like damask silk. The breakers were
red and splendid.
A snake that had been burnt in the brush
crawled along the pink sands to the waterside.
At the edge of wetness it flickered a small head to
and fro. The motion was weak and wavy, pitiful
to see.
Margaret passed, and it darted a forked tongue
at her, but made no attempt to strike. She did
not heed it. Her hands were dropped at her sides
like those of one who is very tired. Her footprints
on the sands filled with water and grew red, as
though she trod a thorny way. The surf splashed
about her ankles, about her knees, about her
waist. She lifted her arms that it might clasp her
well.
“ The undertow ! Take care, Margaret! ” cried
Cooper from the rocks, as she passed beyond his
view.
She turned her face, and a crimson glow suffused
it. Twice or thrice she shook her head in desola-
tion. A wave reared itself in front like a ruby
wall. Then in that scene of rich gleamings and
wonderful lights the undertow took her gently
down.
“ Good-bye, Margaret! ”

A Fantasy of God’s End.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
When Edward Irving, who was a sort of glorified
stock-rider and assistant super, at Restdown, and
who lived at “ Government House,” instead of in
th" men’s hut, chose to run counter to that fine
old Briticist, Andrew Hurst, owner of Restdown,
chairman of the Centralian JVlcat Preserving Co.,
and member of the Executive of the Pastoralists’
Union, he lost a very fine girl, and what is more,
he lost the chance of the position of son-in-law to
Hurst aforesaid.
Hurst was a big authority on meat-freezing,
lamb-marking, irrigation-grown grapes, and'
shearing-strikes ; and he furthermore held a
patent over such phrases as “ right-thinking
people ” (who are always the people who agree
with oneself); “the silken bonds,” “the great
country from which we sprung,” and others of the
kind. But he had neither the quick wit nor the
slow anger necessary for argument, and, there-
fore, as he cut up for half-a-million, most people
agreed with him. But Irving didn’t, which is
why his account had to be closed in a hurry.
Old man Hurst suffered from ch'onic Briticitis,
and had it badly, as people have any disease
which has no alternative symptoms. If old man
Hurst had been able to think, he would not have
had chronic Briticitis. To do him justice, he had
tried to think and had failed. He had developed
callosities on the interior of his skull in his
attempts to think without the possession of
thought’s machinery. But he could prophesy
the lambing accurately, and could top the market
in wool and frozen mutton; and therefore he
filled worthily the station he had been called to.
Irving had been sent to Restdown to get him
out of the way, whatever that may be. Irving,
senior, is a partner in a big wool-house, and when
he read that his son had addressed meetings in
favor of Republicanism, and worse, he felt like
Lear when his family went back on him. So he
sent his son to his old mate at Restdown to be
cured, and Hurst made the mistake of under-
taking the work himself, instead of leaving it to
his daughter.
So the natural end of it was that Irving became
engaged to Alice Hurst, after seventy or more
distinct disagreements with old Hurst, through
falling in the dark over his British prejudices.
One night he said something or other which
roused that gentleman to almost incurable in-
dignation.
* * * *
Two evenings later a tucked-up horse loped
PER CONTRA.
SHE: “ Ah! you’d think more of me, Nellie, if
only I were six feet high!”
SHE: “ Yes, dearest! But then you wouldn’t think so much of me!!”
wearily through the powdered saltbush towards
the boundary rider’s hut at God’s End.
Irving had been bound by an unwritten agreement
to old man Hurst for two years ; and now, acting
with the telegraphed consent of Irving senior,
whom the son would not have worried for a great
deal, old man Hurst ordered him to boundary-ride
the fences of the out-paddocks of the station.
“You’re going to take up pastoral pursoots
some time, Edward,” he said, with a malicious
smile, “ and a pastoralist ought to be able for all
his men can do. I had to learn, anyway.” And
Irving acquiesced sullenly, and with a dull grief
in his stomach.
He rode away north west from the river into
the land of dryness, and its drought entered into
his mouth and became ashes there —dryness with
a pain in it. In his two days’ ride over the vast
possessions of old man Hurst—vast enough to
make a dozen German principalities —he had time
to pity hiimself —and Alice ; but himself mostly.
And the “ distressed masses ” not at all.
It was all so awesomely sudden. He was a
man of the cities—horn to and horn for much
human companionship —and here he was riding
wearily along a powdered saltbush track on a
despairing, sobbing horse, the pungent dust in his
nostrils, as if he were already dead on the
track and the crows circling for an appetite.
Rightly they had named the back station of Rest-
down. You leave the river flats and the gracious
green fringes of white gum and peppermint, and
travel in the eye of the sun into dusty sage-hued
saltbush, with ghastly claypans lying in the dust
like livid wounds, and on to sand and barb bladed
spinifex, and then more saltbush, and more sand
and spinifex. In the sky a sun with a cynical
face, dull gleaming —the only winged life a little
energetic devil of a fly, who prefers feeding on the
nostril to surveying the land, and likes the eyelid
better than either. And, by-and-by, the fly leaves
you, and you cross the waved and billowed ridges
of sand in absolute silence. Verily, it is the End
of God —the condemned-cell of all creation.
This “ Devil-devil ” country throws out as
many hands as civilisation you find little
streams of sand running after the good country,
as if to drown it.
One of the plain-men once told me that every
year this sand really does move, that it really does
grab a foot or so of the good country before it;
the good country behind closing up on it in the
attempt at self compensation.
On the further edge of the Big Sand is a hut,
now unused, except by the occasional Ishmael on
the track, and the saltbush country begins again,
and goes on for quite 40 miles. The loneliness of
the region to the imaginative bushman —and that
includes nearly all—has a wonderful influence for
hallucination, especially when it is mixed with the
unspeakable damper-and-mutton habit, which is
like the worm that dieth not for fixity of tenure.
And one bush hallucination is this : A mile or so
from the hut is a belt of pines, and from the
centre of this, dull, ruddy flames pour into the
sky, like a furnace in blast. But, when you get
within thirty yards of the pines, the flames are not
—they vanish. I have seen this myself—the light,
the dull glare, and the vanishing of the lire.
* * * *
Irving did not see this as he rode towards the
out-station of God’s End, because he had a
stomach used to cookery, and he had not yet lived
the loneliness long enough to imagine such things.
He rode on for half-a-dozen miles deeper into the
better country, and at about nine o’clock his horse
grunted at the light in the hut at God’s End, and
changed his sore-footed lope to a clumsy amble.
A few minutes later the of artesian water
gushmg over the
cracked earth from
No. 3 bore came on
the air, which had
now the softness of
damp in it, and the
horse sprang to the
trough and drank
greedily in the spray.
The young man
wetted his drouth
also, and, having
turned his horse out,
carried saddle and
bridle to the hut.
He entered, and saw
in the side of the
chimney, and under
its dangling, cruel-
looking pothook, an
old, seemingly blood-
less man, of a clay-
colored complexion
and livid ears—ears
which pointed and
lifted like the ears of
a dingo.
“ I heerd yer a
mile back,” said the
hut-keeper, turning
his great, far-seeing
eyes on Irving, “ an’
I put a couple av
chops in the pan.”
Irving thanked
him, and examined
his new mate more
closely, as he bustled
about for a clean
tin - plate, and set
before the visitor a
pannikin whose dis-
colored sides told too
plainly that Hurst
bought the worst
kind of ration-tea.
The hut-keeper
had the imbecile look
of the sheep he tend-
ed, mingled with the
sagacity of the dogs
who were his daily companions. God help
him, poor wretch ! they were many and he was
but one, and now he unconsciously imitated them.
When an unusual sound came along the plain—a
rare thing, alas ! —his nostrils would dilate, snif-
fing the wind like a patriarchal ram in charge of
wild sheep. Should a dog steal a chop, the old
man’s beagle-sccnt found its whereabouts, and
then he beat the hut for it like a pointer, and
showed all the pointer’s satisfaction as he came
on the find.
After he had served Irving’s supper, the strange
old clay-faced animal sat himself on a low box by
the fire, and looked up into the visitor’s face with
a dog’s glance of mingled curiosity, friendliness,
and sagacity. Next he took some fearful vege-
table production from his pocket, charged his
pipe, and filled the hut with smoke, acrid and
oily as the smoke of acacias. Irving, half chok-
ing, proffered his pouch, which the man took
greedily and grinning. Not for many days had
there been tobacco smoked in that hut. The very
dog was used to the fearful sheep-wash the hut-
keeper burned, and when the first whiff of the
long-cut struck his nose, the animal started as if
in pain, growled, and lay down again.
* * * *
The life knew no change. Irving rode the same
fences week after week, occasionally camping at
an out-hut for the night, but nearly always mak-
ing for the habitation of the clay-faced man, even
if it meant riding corners off one of the three
horses allotted him ; for the loneliness and the dys-
peptic diet were beginning to tell, and he became
childishly afraid of the dark. He had a letter
from Alice with the monthly ration-man—letters
with many des-
pairing adjec-
tives in them
and much re-
dundancy o f
spoon-talk for
the first month
or so, and after
that breathing
a gentle air of
resignation
which would
have

THE MAN : “ Phat are yer looking at?”

shown
him, had
he been
e xp eri-
enced in
such things,
that Alice was
attempting to con-
sole herself —with
great success. So
Irving had these letters, and the great grey
plains, and the unspeakable damper, and the
willow-tea, and the clay-faced man to live on, and
they didn’t represent one per cent, of the life
necessary to him.
He hadn’t anyone else near to care for, so he
cared for his horse and his dog, and he grew to
love old George, the clay-faced man. As for the
sheep—he hated them. The dogs keep a man
from going mad quickly in such surroundings
but God help the man who sees sheep every day.
No man, least of all an imaginative, heart-
diseased man like Irving, could live long on God’s
End and stay entirely sane. And one night
Irving galloped back from the hut on the edge of
the Big Sand—queachy and clammed—riding in a
s raight line blindly—off the track and on the
track no matter where, and casting frightened
glances behind him.
Old George stood at the door, and saw his new
mate tremble ; but old George’s eyes did not look
surprise, nor anything else —his far sight was the
sight of a man who had looked all over the world
at a glance to And a friend, and had failed, and his
look never changed.
Irving staggered into the hut and sat by the
Are, where simmered the everlasting chop in the
eternal frying-pan, and old George followed him.
“I’m going mad all right,’’ said Irving, in a
dull, satisAed tone. “Just at the edge of the Big
Sand I saw the pine belt on Are, and myself walk-
ing in it, and when I got near the belt the Are
went out.”
Old George nodded. “You’ve seen Bryney’s
Fire,” he answered. “ Most of ’em sees that some
time. You’ve been pretty slow.” “ Why? he
looked round and whispered —“ one time I used to
see red snakes in that Are, and I hadn’t been to no
shanty neither.”
He looked round again and concluded, his voice
full of pride at his own cunning : “ That’s why I
always wear my pants inside my boots. I don’t
take no risks now, not me.”
“ What is the cause of me seeing this ? Am I
going mad with the loneliness ?
“Not you,” said the clay - colored lunatic.
“Them things are on the plains right enough,
’s much as you an’ me ; but, if yer a noo-chum,
yer eyes ain’t good an’ yer can’t see ’em.”
Irving took this explanation, drank his un-
speakable tea, and lay down in his hunk, still
trembling. Old George cleared up, and seated
himself outside the hut, smoking his sheep-wash
tobacco.
The night was rather dark, but starlit, and the
slush-lamp on the table sputtered and dickered in
the rich sheep-fat—trying for Aame as an apoplec-
tic old man tries for breath —and the hut lay in
half-shadow. Outside, the only noises were from
the sheep drinking at No. 3 and the dull, rusty
croak of the only frog God’s End ever knew—a
foreigner, who had come there a fortnight or so
after the bore had begun to Aow—a pathetic
foreigner, who never had a mate. Listening is
the sublime sense at night, and Irving strained
for the sounds that were not, until his ears
creaked.
The voice from the bunk : “ This loneliness is
dreadful, George.”
The voice from outside : “ Loneliness ! No
fear. Why, damn me eyes, I’ve seen a bigger
crowd on this ’ere plain than Adeled and Melb’n
Cup.”
“ How could you ? ” said Irving.
“Well, when I feel lonely, I jist sit ’ere an’
I wish, an’ wish, an’ wish to see somebody I
knoo; an’ wen I wish enough, by Christ, they
come ! ”
The lapping of the sheep merged into no
sound, and the water gushed more freely from
No. 3, as a drift, a thousand feet below, gave
way and became sand.
The man in the bunk trembled, and struggled
to get up, and at last joined the old man at the
hut door.
George’s eyes were mania-lit, and, in that half-
dark, shone like a cat’s.
“ An’ now you’ll see, Mr. Irving,’’ he said, “ 111
wish an’ wish, an’ they’ll come—fur ye’ve lived 'ere
long enough to have yer sight ”
And Irving had eyes to see, for he had lived a
twelvemonth at God’s End, and the aftermath of
the tea and the mutton knew him.
Old George stood up with a new air and a new
dignity, and commanded the sky and the stars,
and the ruffled plain and the gushing bore.
“ I wish, an’ I wish, an’ I wish,” he said, an
I wish ter see my wife an’ the cove she run away
with; an’ I want ter see Super Hordern,
for he was a man, and no bastard ; an’ I wish to
see the red-bearded, cow what took me down last
Hungerford races ; an’ I wish to see my little girl
what’s dead, an’ the sheep I’ve drafted off God’s
End for thirteen years, an’ the ’orse what broke his
’eart takin’ me to Milparinka for the doctor for
Flash Carrie’s kid, an’ I wish all my frien’s, and
all my enemies, an’ I say —‘ Come !’ ”
And then to both of them came the seeming of
a new world —the bore sunk into silence, and the
ground heaved very gently and warmly, like a
woman’s breast. And the saltbush surrendered to
the trampling of many feet, and there came a
great host, and the plain was peopled with absent
souls.
In the van an army of men and women and
children, and these old George called on by name,
blessing or cursing them as he had done when
they were substance, but taking the edge off his
blasphemies by giving the shadows of his wife and
her new man more than the ; r average share.
Then came a big, fair-boar led man on a bright
bay, and old George threw his hands abroad
with cries of welcome, and told to Irving, who sat
there interested and unhorrified, the names and
deeds of his shadow-men.
“That’s Super Hordern on the bay, an’ he u>as
‘ white.’
“That’s the cove what cleared with my wife.
Ah ! Jim Douglas! blast yer ! If yer only had a
NATURE'S FORESIGHT.
MRS. CHUBBS : “That there Mrs. Mugg does
nothin' but tork ter men all day."
MRS. SLIMWALLOW : “ Yers, I was only saying
ter my ’usband last night—I do take a drop of
ale for my ’elth no’ and then, en I’ll admit it;
but thank ’evens 'e won't never come 'ome and
find no man ever tor kin’ to me.”
neck to squeeze and eyes to start I’d squeeze and
start ’em.
“ That’s my little kid—which she died.
“ That’s the cove what welshed me at Hunger-
ford.”
The men passed and the horses came, and
among them the horse that broke his heart at
Milparinka, saddled and bridled, foam-flecked
and blood-eyed, near his last gasp and going
strong in his gallop to the end. And then mil-
lions of sheep—a plain flush of moving wool from
horizon to horizon, closely packed and half-dying
of fear, and the ghosts of many dogs harrying into
weird, awful rushes of small hoofs the shadows
of the sheep drafted from God’s End during
thirteen years.


And then came more men, and among them old
Hurst.
This fired Irving. He rose with some of the
madness of the clay-faced man, and said, ehok-
ingly, and half-hoping that his wish would not be
gratified.
“ I wish and I wish. I wish to see my father ! ”
And instantly there came through the salt-bush a
dapper business man, florid, clean-cut and of im-
maculate linen and acme of polished hat and
boots, and under his arm the journal of the
Imperial Federation League, which last is the
truest ghost of all.
The clay-faced man tunied in his joy. “ That’s
yer father, isn’t it? An’ you can see as well as
me. At last I’ve got a good mate !”
Irving did not heed him —he was about to take
a plunge. And he said, slavishly and supersti-
tiously adhering to the formula of old George :
“ I wish and I wish. I wish to see Alice
Hurst.” And then a miracle happened, for the
sense of the ear stretched itself as the sense of
the eye had done in obedience to their wish, and
this coming ghost they heard.
There came horse-hoofs at a gallop—the klop-
klop of hoofs on a patch of iron slugs, the spurn-
ing of a pebble-belt by the flying feet, the creesh
of the coarse granite sand, the rattle of sapless
salt-bush twigs—and the sheep from the hut to
the western horizon parted like water for a ship
and closed again as a ship’s wake.
Then the breaking from gallop to trot for a
yard or two, the swift urging by the rider again,
and a big roan parted the ghosts and bore Alice
Hurst into the light.
Irving looked at the new apparition for a
thought—screamed and fell dead !
And then the ghosts melted, and Alice Hurst
and Old George carried Irving’s body into the hut
and laid it in the
bed-place.
She tearfully bullied
the clay-faced man for
having taken such little
care of Irving, and he
answered sulkily :
“ ’Ow di’ know he ’ad ’eait di-ease. You
shouldn’t alowt ’iin come away from Restdown.
It wants a man with a stomach like a bottle to
stand this, I tell yer,’’
And as sulkily did the old shadow-raiser obey
her commands to ride to the pine-belt with her,
as her father lay there with his back broken, his
intended visit of inspection to God’s End having
ended that way.
“ Why did the boss want to go sneakin’ out to
a back stashun without tellin’ us ? ” said George.
“If we’d expected yer Mr. Irving wouldn’t a
been cold meat now.”
Alice did not answer him except in the way of
tears, which may mean anything, and in silence
they reached the hut on the edge of the Big Sand,
to find her father ready to be carried back to
Restdown. The fall from that accursed shying
horse had broken his back, and he would never
move again. On the way to Restdo wn by easy
stages he heard her story, and could only foam—
his rage at his mistaken courses in regard to
young Irving and his own helplessness taking
away speech. Arrived at the homestead on the
river flats, he issued instructions for somebody to
go out to God’s End to look to the young fellow’s
grave, and then, like the brave old dog-fox he
was, he died cursing his own broken back and the
clay-colored hutkeeper and the cure that killed
Irving, and the Briticitis which sent him to God’s
End. For old-man Hurst loved the boy.
Alice wept for some time over her father as a
matter of duty, and over Irving because she could
weep for two hours as easily as she could for 20
minutes, and then she incontinently loved another
fellow, vociferating to her friends, and to herself
most of all, that she loved George because he had
Edward Irving’s eyes.
* • » •
The clay-colored man at No. 3 Bore, God’s
End, still sits, in the half dark evenings, be-
fore his hut, and gives human form to the
air and souls to the dust. And he has a new

The Brown Baby.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
Four lint-locked, pale-eyed, freckle-faced children
sat on a bench in the shade of the open cart-shed
abutting on the two-roomed slab-hut which was
the homestead of “ Arundel, ” the large-sounding
name of Joe Smith’s small selection. Never lively
children at the best of times, to-day they were re-
duced to an awed silence, for over the bark-roofed
dwelling the Angel of Death was hovering for the
first time, and the brown baby was fighting for
life and playing her losing game bravely.
The mailman used to say the brown baby was a
freak of nature. Certainly she looked odd amongst
her white-haired brothers and sisters ; and her
olive skin, vivid lips, and tangle of bronze-brown
hair, and her abundant animal spirits, contrasted
sharply with their phlegmatic listlessness.
“ She don’t favor neither of you.” So strangers
were wont to remark when they looked from the
child to her anaemic, dull-eyed mother and fair-
haired father —though Joe was of a stalwart type,
despite his pale covering.
“I’ve heard tell that my grandmother came of
the gipsy Gordons—all as black as your hat,” he
often said, and his heart had gone out to his
youngest born, the brown baby, from the moment
her black eyes smiled up to his grey ones. Joe
loved her as he had loved no one else on earth
since he was a very young man, long before the
advent of “Mrs.” Smith, in the days when a pair
of dark eyes used to brighten at his coming. He
had reason to be proud of her, too, as the years
went on, for she was the prettiest, merriest,
cleverest little maid in the district. The ‘ ‘ finest
four-year-old on the Barwon.” This, again, was
the mailman’s verdict, and he knew every squat-
ter’s or selector’s child on the river.
He brought a letter soon after the brown baby
fell ill, and Joe took him in to
see her tossing restlessly on the
corn-cob mattress.
He advised sending for the
doctor at once, and suggested
taking a spare horse to the half-way pub.
for him. “ There were several cases of diph-
theria down the river,” he said, and he added that
it was “a kind of sore throat that chokes ’em in
the end, unless a doctor was by to stick a breathin’
tube in their necks, ” and he also said that he had
heard that only clever doctors would do it, as the
least slip meant “cut your throat.”
And so the bay mare was sent, and Joe counted
the minutes and hours until he should see her
white star again. He fixed a tin tube on to the
kettle, and boiled young gum-leaves in the hope
they might yield eucalyptol; but there is little
enough one can do on a lonely selection, bare of
half the necessaries of life, especially when the
dog-eared medical guide has all the pages torn
put that deal with throat-affections.
His wife was a helpless sort of person at the
best of times—an emergency at any time simply
paralysed her; and so it was that Joe spent the
days sitting before the big ant-bed fireplace, with
the brown baby wrapped in blankets in his arms,
while the'child’s mother wept herself limp, with
her apron over her head, in a corner.
The four children outside watched the road
continually. It wound like a snake of no par-
ticular color over the yellow, sun-dried plain, and
disappeared in a lake of shining mirage water,
along whose’ shores the heat danced in a silver
haze. “ He’s cornin’, Dad ! —lie’s cornin’!” The
cry brought the woman to the door. She looked
at the distant horseman, and than went in again,
carefully pulling down the bagging after her. Joe
had nailed old wool packs over the worst cracks in
the unlined slab-walled building to keep out
draughts when the. westerly winds should come
prowling Over the plains. But there were no
draughts abroad to-day in the still midsummer
noon.
“He’s coinin’,” Said the woman. “How does
she seem ? ”
“ Worse. If he don’t hurry she’ll choke before
your eyes. What in hell has kept him so long !
He could have been here two good hours ago.”
“Oh, Joe!” wailed the woman. “You’ll never
let him go cuttin’ my poor baby’s throat —lie’ll
kill her, sure as life, and murdered ohildren can’t
rest easy. Let her die natural ”
“ Who’s talkin’ of dying, you fool 1 ” shouted the
man, irritable from grief and despair. “He saved
Burton’s kid by stickin’a tube in its throat, and
if he can save this one he can do it any road' he
likes. Go out and get more wood, the steam
makes her easier, and send him in at once.
Go on ! ” «|
The woman slunk away.
There was a new light of hope in the
man’s sullen face as he brushed back the
tangled brown curls lying against his j
shoulder. i
When doctors come perhaps but once
in a life-time, and can charge what they
like, irrespective of mileage, faith in their
powers is apt to be boundless. A few
minutes afterwards he heard the hoof-
beats on the main road, which ran
close to the house, and he listened
eagerly for their cessation at the slip-
rails.
In vain. The hoof-beats broke
into a sharp canter and died
swiftly away.
“Oh, childer ! ” cried the
woman, collapsing in a heap
on an upturned bucket—
“ I’m scared to go nigh
him if he calls me.”
But the man did not call
her. Passing travellers
were few as a rule, yet Fate
had sent two to-day to torture him
through the whole gamut of hope
to despair.
The four children were disap-
pointed, too. Things were out of
joint, and they were hungry. No
one seemed to think of meals, but
they hoped for better things when
the doctor had been. Like the good,
dull little souls they were, they com-
plained not, but turned their eyes to
the road again and awaited developments.
“ He’s cornin’ this time.”
“Don’t tell Dad till you are sure,” cautioned
their mother.
But she knew the bay mare’s white blaze as
horse and rider approached at a break-neck pace,
and she ran in to tell her husband.
“ He’s here—at the rails,” she said.
But now that the supreme moment had come
Joe felt afraid with a strange doubt. He drew
down the blanket and looked long at his baby’s
plump little throat. “ But he couldn’t hurt her,”
he muttered. “She’s the prettiest kid from here
to Bourke.”
The doctor was in a cheerful mood. His hand-
some, sensual Celtic face beamed good-nature.
He shouted to the children, and smiled at the
woman, and hurried along so fast that he struck
the door-post instead of the door-way, and then
rubbed his head so comically that the four lint-
locks shook with silent laughter. Then he went
in, leaving the door wide open.
“What’sthis! What’s this!” he cried cheer-
fully. “A child ill. You bush people alarm
yourself over nothing.”
The father lifted his head in dull wonderment
at the doctor’s hop-o’-my-thumb manner. Then
he said, slowly—“ She’s real bad; I think it’s the
diptliery. ”
The doctor looked earnestly at the tiny face and
listened to the whistling breath that all the cheer-
ful hissing of the kettle could not drown. His
trained eye and ear mechanically served him.
He knew that it was tracheotomy, or—and per-
haps, even then!
He rubbed his head and swore at the heat of the
room. “Makes me feel quite giddy.”
He said: “H’m, a bad case, a very bad case,
but we’ve something here that may . Hi,
where’s my bag—ah ! And we’ll all go a-hunting
to-day, all go a-hunting to-day. I’ll tell ye a good
yarn by-and-bye, Joe—a real, tip-top yarn.”
He rapidly, took out various instruments and
laid them on the table, passing his hand across
his eyes every now and then as if to keep his
thoughts unclouded ; and Joe, watching sullenly,
held his child tightly to his breast and said, “You
are drunk, or half-way there—so that’s what kep’
you from a dyin’ child.”
IT FLEW UP AND HIT HUT!
IRASCIBLE BUT KIND-HEARTED BOSS (often swearing at office-boy): “There, there, boy; don't
mind what I say."
BOY: “ No, sir ; we never do! ”
FOCUSSED!
PATMAN: “ I can see no depression.”
UNEMPLOYED : “I can feel it though.”
PATMAN : "How?”
UNEMPLOYED: “In the pit of me stummick! ”
“ ’Sure you I’m not; here’s everything—chloro-
form, tube, and all. Ticklish job, Joe, very.
Tracheotomy—there, now, what was I sayin’—
confound this steaming room, it’s confusing me—
yes, tracheotomy—hard word that, couldn’t say it
if I was drunk now, could I ? Off with the horse-
rug, Joe, and we will fix her up in no time ! ”
But Joe drew the blanket tighter.
“Child will die in an hour, if you don’t,” said
the doctor. “ Say lam drunk, do you ? No man
ever told Pitz O’Brien that he was drunk. Why,
you’re drunk yourself, man—blind-drunk ! ”
Joe looked long at the excited face, and remem-
bered all he had heard of this man’s cleverness.
Then he glanced down at the shapely hands
moving amongst the bright instruments—they
were shaking badly. He could give life to the
“brown baby ” by his skill. He had given the Bur-
tons back their child from the brink of the grave—
but there was no pub. on the way to Burton’s.
The child struggled feebly in his arms, and a
wave of passion swept over the man’s brain.
“ Get out o’ this ! ” he shouted, “ or, by the
God that made such swine as you, I’ll kill you ! ”
And Pitz O’Brien, M.D., had enough of his
fuddled senses left to know the truth when he
heard it.
The waiting children were amused again, watch
ing the doctor trying to mount his horse. He
seemed to have some difficulty in knowing how
to begin operations, but their amusement was
short-lived, for the woman ran out and, holding his
stirrup, helped him into the saddle.
“Make tracks!” she whispered. “He is that
mad, if the child dies while you are here he’ll kill
you. I’m glad myself that you are goin’ to let her
die natural. Por God’s sake, go ! ”
An hour afterwards the “brown baby” was
dead, and Joe Smith had lost his faith in all
things, human and divine.
ETHEL M[?]S.


Sam’s Wife.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
“Another five years ought to see us through,
Wife.”
“Tell me, 0 Sage, why it is that the years in
front are so much longer than those behind, ” she
answered.
“Because human beings are given to making
false quantities. Which do you think will make
the bigger sand-hill—all the sugar that we shall
buy in the next five years or all that we have
bought in the past? Let’s have a look at the
bank-book ! ” It was brought from a wonderful
little hiding-place in the kitchen, and the three of
us read the story again. There were half-crowns,
shillings, and even sixpences in the first part of
the book, always dated on a Monday. “Do you
remember this sixpence, dear? It was all we
could spare for the bank that week, and on the
Saturday night we considered whether we should
break our rule and put nothing iri the bank or
have a milk-cake for tea on Sunday, as usual.
You needn’t laugh, Father Francis; you know
you liked to drop in just in time for tea.”
That was quite true ; I did. And she laughed—
the cheery laugh that had carried the years on its
shoulders with such fortitude.
“Sam, do you remember the Mark Twain 3s. ?”
That reminiscence I considered quite my own
property, and not Sam’s at all.
She had that the sordid, uncongenial
surroundings of the mining township were depres-
sing, and the demon of silence was gaining a
mastery over her ; so she made a resolve, in my
hearing, to say “something funny, really funny,”
every day for a week. I bet sixpence against each
“really-funnyism,” and lost every time; hence the
title.
“Ah! this is the Christmas bonnet-l Os. You
were deluded that time, Sam.” Sam looked
puzzled, as he had looked puzzled over the same
item before. “Would you like to know how?
You thought that I should have a new bonnet for
Christmas because everybody in church had a new
one. But I didn’t see the force of that and took
my old bonnet to pieces and trimmed it up again,
AN UNAPPROPRIATED BLESSING.
MISS OLDUN : “ Can’t that baby walk yet? Why,
when I was half his age I could go alone quite
well.”
YOUNG MOTHER: “Yes; and you've managed to
go alone ever since! ”
only spending Is. for the strings, and—there you
see the 10s. you gave me—it means wifely dis-
obedience. You did admire that bonnet, Sam.”
And the stories went on. I had often heard
them before, but it was very pleasant to me to
watch these two people; the man with his intense
earnestness, and the woman—ah ! she was a puzzle
indeed. Her refined merriment was the first
peculiarity that I had noticed, and next her
worldly wisdom. Her opinions were eagerly
sought on any critical matters. Intellectual
equals she had none in the township, and yet she
was the friend of all. No one took a keener inter-
est in everyday trifles, but she was alone. It was
my 40 years’ experience of God’s creatures that
told me what no one else knew. And I dared not
intrude my sympathies. However great might be
her loneliness of spirit, I knew of no better salve
than her brave life in everyday matters; and pity
I could not feel. One does not pity the mighty
rocks that steadfastly resist whilst being eaten
away by the ocean.
And while I wondered at the great life mys-
teries, these two good friends of mine were still
consulting the bank-book, Sam listening with ad-
miration to the merry exaggerations of his wife, as
she so aptly mixed fact with fancy that we got
confused in trying to extract the former from the
latter. And yet we had helped in our clumsy ‘ ‘ man’s
way ”to make the facts. Here is one instance —
Sam pointed to a =£l deposit and said with a groan,
“That tobacco pound is the joint noble action of
our lives. Father and the wife are responsible for
the absence of a good many more tobacco pounds.”
“Or joint noble actions,” I added.
“Or continual misery,” triumphantly added
Sam’s wife. The last was the greatest truth,
because we had been considerably comforted by
her edict against our deprivation of tobacco.
“ Do you want that river-home as much as ever,
Wife ? ” asked Sam.
“Oh, yes. More than ever.”
Then I noticed a peculiar twitching of the hands,
which was the only outward sign she ever gave
that she was not the “ happy body ” that someone
had nicknamed her. “Don’t you want it?’
Sam’s slow-moving brain was quick enough then
to dissemble and say, “By all means, Wife.”
That was Sam’s little weakness ; I never saw
him enthusiastic over anything. He would jog-
trot for ever if left to himself ; which has its
virtues, but I confess to an admiration for mis-
directed energy rather than for sloth.
Hard, incessant toil and drinking were the
main features of our town, and Sam’s wife had a
sweet, healthy sense of the beautiful. She ex-
tracted sweetness out of everything. Her husband
said she was like a child over flowers and insects.
Possibly, and no harm in that either, but in her
wisdom and tact she was that highest of all God’s
creatures, a good woman. No one had benefited
more than Sam, and he knew it. I think that
is why he was so fond of the place. Who would
not love the place that was the scene of his re-
generation ?
Then the five years were completed, and Sam
and his wife were leaving—leaving their home of
twenty years. There was grief that day in the
township. The old men and women would miss
their comforter, and the young ones their inspira-
tion, and the little ones would know the loss of a
wise counsellor, because the childless woman had
more of motherliness in her heart than anybody I
ever knew.
Perhaps the saddest of all was a coterie of about
thirty girls—“ The Ramblers” they were called.
Having interested herself in the flower and animal
life of the surrounding country, Sam’s wife had
begun by taking the girls for excursions in the
bush, and now they were losing their guide.
A young wife said, “ If I succeed in making my
life a quarter as useful as you have made yours,
people may still bless the store.”
“Good-bye, Father. Don’t scorn me for the
crowning selfishness of my life. If lam so useful
here I ought not to be seeking happiness else-
where. ”
Without feeling a fraction of the scorn, I said,
“ Your girl-friends alone will have benefited by
your struggles against difficulties. My child, no
one deserves rest and peace more than you.”
For the first time I saw fear in her face. She
thought I meant to tell her that I knew , and I
added, “ Man’s highest aim is to be happy. My
interpretation of that is that no one could be per-
fectly happy unless they made others so.”
Then we lost sight of them, because they went
into the sunbeams and our eyes were
dazzled, and we talked of them
as we talked of the dead.
I had no word of con-
solation, and joined in
with the sad reminis-
cences.
In a few weeks I
had a letter, and
with my good news
came back my
power for good.
How many eyes
feasted them-
selves on that
letter I can’t ex-
actly say. I know
one of the Ham-
blerscopied itinto
an old exercise-
book, and learnt
it off by heart.
Then, in a few
years, I had a holi-
day. I’m not going
to say what gymnastic
exercises I took when
I heard the good news.
I left two days after.
A week later I was hir-
ing a boat to row up
the river. The owner
seemed to think he had
better row, so in the ex-
uberance of the moment
I told him I had once
rowed in the University
eight, and, tucking my
coat in the bow, I pushed
off over the glinting
waters, past a childish-
looking island with sea-
gulls gathered in scores on
a partly-covered rock.
“Well done, Mr. Searl,” called a
youngster as I leant on my oars and the tide
drifted me backwards. Even a mild old man is apt
to exert himself under such circumstances, and I
bent to theoars again. The river and bank werecon-
versing in gentle windy whispers. On asandy little
beach some lads were undressing for a swim, the
llesh-color showing exquisitely against the bushes.
Fairy flower-beds and gracious human homes
passed in a glad procession. At one of them a
flower in white rolled and tumbled down the
lawn towards the boat-shed, there to be caught in
somebody’s arms, and the two tumbled and
laughed in earnest. Oh, yes, I should know the
place without any telling, and would just walk in
at tea-time as though I had seen them yesterday.
There it was ! Masses of sunflowers were bending
and swaying in the breeze. The sun dazzled my
eyes. 1 would wait, as it would be gone in a few
minutes. Strange that I should hesitate now,
and I had been rowing up the river at great
speed. A boat of merry girls and boys rowed past;
then a racing crew, and their noisy happiness was
the pleasantest thing I had seen on that pleasantest
of rivers. I landed near an old she-oak, and it
sang in swishing tones, “Just in time, just in the
nick of time.” Yes, truly—just in time to see a
hideous square-shaped board with “To Let”
painted on it—painted a royal blue on white !
* * * *
“To Let ! ” It was no use going any further
now: the notice told me all. The inevitable had
happened. They were no longer the good com-
rades they had been. I was not surprised. It
seemed the only possible ending. Even after
twenty years the woman had found that the un-
congenial companionship of an uncultured man
was unbearable.
Then someone called “Coo-e-e!” Sam’s voice
answered, and—to the everlasting confusion of my
evil surmises—Sam’s wife came out of the house
to meet him as he came from the bush, and hers
was the same cheery voice and Sam’s the same
solemn old face of old.
My confusion was great. I looked stupidly at
the sign-board and said I had not expected it.
“Tell him, Sam,” said his wife. “He is our
oldest friend.” And Sam explained in a few
words: ‘‘ My wife inherited a tendency to in-
sanity. Her best chance was a calm, equable life,
with no great mental strain. We led such a life,
you know, at the old place. She misses her work.
It had grown to be part of ourselves. We propose
going back.”
* * * *
And my sentimental, hackneyed twaddle about
her superiority and Sam’s unfitness was the
nearest approach I had been able to make to the
patience and nobility of these two lives.
They are back in the township now, and the
“Ramblers” are learning some more of Life’s
lessons.

The Reward of Virtue.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
“That was right, what you said to-night,” re-
marked George, the cook, sitting to windward of the
fire. “You do a man a good turn, and
you’ll always get a stroke of luck after it. I
was going to say so at the time, on’y for
them,” pointing over his shoulder at the
sleeping camp; “they’d on’y sling-off at
a cove. Tell you what happened to me.
It was when I lived in Brisbane, seven
year ago. My people was all re-
spectable, but me. I was a
pretty bad egg, I tell you.
Used to sneak cash from the old
woman; an’ I got away with a
baker’s bag off ’is cart once.
I guess it was about time
I cleared out. But I
done a good turn once,
an’ got a stroke of
luck through it. It
was a holiday, an’
they was races at
Eagle Farm. I start-
ed early, to walk
out through Lut-
wyche. There was a
girl there I was runnin’,
an’ I wanted to see ’er,
so I ’ad my best suit
on; but, as I was jump-
ing a paddock-fence into
the road, my collar-stud
broke. So I starts to look
for a shop to buy a stud. I
sees a little bit of a place with
fruit in the window. I goes in
an’ knocks, but nobody comes;
so I knocks again, pretty loud. I ’ad
to knock two or three times, an’ then an old
woman come in from the back with ’er sleeves
rolled up, an’ there was suds on ’er arms. I buys
a couple of bone studs and some apples, and says,
‘I suppose, mother, you couldn’t change a
sovereign?’ ‘Oh, yes, I can,’ she says, an’she
dives under the counter and fetches up a cash-box;
an’ when she opens it I see it was stuffed full of
notes an’ gold. She give me the change, an’ I see
’er put the box back under the counter again. I
goes out of the shop, an’ I sees ’er go through the
curtain an’ out into the yard like. Well, I went
up the street a bit, an’ I thinks of that cash-box
an’ ’ow easy it could be shook. Then I goes back
an’ ’as a look in the front of the shop. There was
no one there an’ nobody in the street; so I sneaks
into the shop, shoves my ’and over the counter,
out with the cash-box, shoves it under my coat,
’ops over the fence an’through the paddock into
some ti-tree scrub. I opens the box, an’ there was
twenty-seven quid in it an’ some silver; so I
shoves it in my kick, an’ plants the cash-box in the
scrub; then I out of the paddock an’ off ’ome.
I ’ad a plant there, an’ I puts the stuff in, all but
a quid an’ the silver. ’Twas a sight more ’n I’d
ever ’ad, an’ all the time I was drinkin’ with some
mates I kept wanting to go back an’ count it, just
to feel it was real like. But I got squiffy, and
when the chaps got me ’ome I lay in the yard
nearly all night. I dodged me mother in the
mornin’, an’ sneaked the paper, an’ off to a quiet
place to see if there was anything about the old
woman’s cash-box. It was there all right; said
as ’er ’usband ’ad pegged-out a fortnight ago, an’
this was money she’d saved up, and she was
terrible cut - up. Some cove ’ad been in an’
changed a quid, she told theD.’s, but she wouldn’t
know ’im again. I was in a funk when I read
about the D.’s, but when I see they ’adn’t no trace
I felt a bit better. But I couldn’t help thinkin’
of the old woman. I felt real sorry for the poor
old girl, an’ I ’ad an awful ’ead on me ; so, take
it all round, I didn’t feel too lively. And when I
went into town some of the blokes was talkin’ of
the affair. Some of ’em knew ’er, and reckoned
she was a real good sort, ’cause she used to stand
’em tickin’ things. Made me feel a bit off, so I
sneaked away ’ome ; an’ though I ’ad a good few
drinks that night, I couldn’t sleep a wink for
thinkin’ of the D.’s an’ the old woman cryin’.
Next morning I was out early to get the paper,
an’ it said ’ow the old woman was in a fix ’cause
’er daughter at Toowoomba was ill an’ she couldn’t
get to ’er, an’ that there ought to be a subscription

got up for ’er. Well, I couldn’t suffer it no longer.
So I waited till it was about 5, an’ gettin’ darkish.
Then I puts on some old clothes, with an ’anker-
chief round my neck, an’ got the twenty-six quid
what was left, an’ off out Lutwyche way. When I
got into the street the shop was in I has a good
look round, an’ then dives in an’ knocks. The old
woman come out, an’ I buys some lollies ; an’ when
I was paying ’er I says, speakin’ thick, ‘ I see
you ’ad a bit of bad luck the other day, mother-
lost some money ! ’
“ ‘Yes,’ says she —‘ all I had in the world; ’ an’
she starts cryin’.
“‘I see where a cove come in an’ changed a
quid just before you missed it, ’ I says. ‘Would
you know ’im again if you seen ’im ? ’—an’ I gets
the stuff ready in my ’and.
“ ‘ No,’ she says, shakin’ ’er old ’ead, ‘ I wouldn’t
know ’im from Adam ! ’
“ ‘Then never you know ’im again,' mother,’ I
says ; an’ I leans across the counter an’ shoves the
twenty-six quid in ’er two ’ands, an’ out of the
shop an’off! ~ .
“I never stopped runnm till I was through
the Albion. I felt so fine I couldn’t keep
still till I seen some fellows looking. When I got
home I felt such a lot better that I thought I’d
go into town, and while I was waitin’ for a tram
I see some Deadwood Dicks as I ’adn’t read in a
shop-window. So I goes in an’ knocks. It was a
pretty big shop—books on one side, an’ tobacco
an’ pipes an’ things on the other. No one come,
so I knocks again. I ’eard a bit of scuffling up on
top, like as if there was a row on, so I goes through
the door to the stairs an’ knocks again ; but they
couldn’t ’ear for the row upstairs. So I climbs
up, an’ there was the two kids, as ought to ’ave
been looking after the shop, with the gloves on,
’avin’ a go. I was goin’ to sing out, when I
thinks: the boss must be out, or they wouldn’t be
larkin’. So I goes down quietly, an’ out to the
front of the shop an’ ’as a look up an’ down.
There didn’t seem no one coinin’, so I sneaks
behind the counter an’ gets at the till. I got
away with the blanky lot, an’ out an’ home to my
plant; an’ when I counted it, there was forty-
three quid, not counting stamps and two cheques.
So you see what a good turn does for you ! If I
’adn’t give that old woman back ’er twenty-six
quid. I’d never ’a got that forty-three quid from
the other place.”

A Bit of Old Sydney.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
"AFTER HER OWN HEART."
"SHE: "If you do cull , you'll have to leave very
early, 'cause pa always turns the gas off at half-
past nine.”
HE: “Ah! then I won’t come round until nine
thirty-five!”
He boarded the train at Kelso, entering the car
in a deprecatory way, and looking around with a
wistful smile. ‘‘ I believe, ”he said, hesitatingly,
“ thet this kerridge’s bound for Sydney ?”
Being assured upon that point, he sat down,
took off his slouch hat, and wiped his forehead
with a large handkerchief. He sat opposite to me.
“Phew !” he said, “hot, ain’t it? Got a pig
on the train. Took a lot o’ persuadin’ t’get him
onboard. Ain’t used ter it. Like me, ”he added,
apologetically, “never travelled by rail before.”
He was a small, thin, war-worn-looking man,
seemingly about 70 years old. If he had never
travelled by train before, he must have been hidden
away back for many years. I hinted as much.
“Yes,” he assented, “that’s so. More’n forty
year sin’ I fust come up here. No railways then,
I tell you. Pour weeks we was, with the drays
from Sydney. Dunahoo stuck us up. He was
out then. Heard o’ Dunahoo, mebbe ? But not
likely. Long afore your time. More ’n forty year.
Never been ter town sin’. Wouldn’t go now, only
I got a pig to show at ther Agreecultooral Exhi-
bishun. A stunner—my word ! ”
Here the whistle sounded shrilly. The old man
poked his head out. The train started with a
jerk, and he fell back on his seat.
“Well,” he gasped, “it’s wonnerful !” All
through the journey he simmered with suppressed
excitement. When we shot into a tunnel he
howled, “Ere —there ! lemme out !”and when we
passed into light again he said, staring impres-
sively at me, “ It’s amazin’, ain’t it —real
amazin’?”
But when we ascended the Zig-zag, the old chap
gave in. A glance through the window somi-
paralysed him. He sat back, closed his eyes, and
appeared to pray. I gave him a nip from my
flask. Then he said: “I spose there’s speshul
insurance on that bit of th’ road? Now, if it’s a
fair question, how often do they do it without
breakin’ up?”
He evidjntly did not believe me when I told
him that, so far, there had been no serious mishap.
But he was too polite to say so. And during the
time we ran along the mountain-track he was
busily engaged in endeavors to recognise the land-
marks of his journey forty years before. Now
and again, when the old coach-road could be seen,
he worked up into a kind of ecstasy; but as a
general thing he seemed to conclude that the
mountains, like everything else, had changed
altogether, and were not those he had toiled over
forty years before.
He was gravely concerned when we descended
by the zig-zag method on to the Emu Plains. “If
I’d ha’ knowed, I don’t think I’d ha’ come, ”he
said. “ I wonder what that there pig thinks of it! ”
Next day I met the old man in George-sfcreet.
‘‘Howd’ye do ?” he cried. “I’ve been roun’ th’ole
diggins. It’s wonnerful, the changes. Butlrecker-
nise a good many o’ the ole shops. Had a drink
this mornin’in a pub. I used to use fifty year ago—
fif-ty year ago ! And there’s the markets, same
as ever ! Yes. But, I say, what’d they do with
the bones o’ them as was planted in the ole
buryin’ groun’ up Mmor, whpru they’re buildin'
a town ’all—hey? I knowed a many on ’em.
What’d they do with ther bones? An’the grave-
stones?”
I told him that I had seen many cartloads of
bones taken from the old grave-yard off Druitt-
street, and that my impression was that they
were converted into charcoal to refine sugar. He
, . , , .
looked at me curiously.
“Now, you’re fakin’ a rise outer the ole man,”
said he. “They wouldn’t do sech a thing in the
ole days, much less these times. They was very
pertickler in the ole days with the dead—dam
~,,. , , . ,
sight more pertickler with the dead than the hvm.
An’a lot o’free people was buried there. Anthony
Brady—he was grave-digger. Yes. Why,” and
here he became quite animated, “there was a
, i. ~ ~„ , ,
vault there—yes. B longed to a soljer officer.
They’d never turn his bones into charcoal ter fine
sugar. Oh, get on ! You’re laying it on, sonny,
An’that’s the noo post office as they’re buildin’,
hey? Well, it’s wonnerful. Margret Catchpole
had a cottage just there—yes. She was a stunner,
Hurn ! An’ that’s where the Parramatta coach
and the Windsor coach used to start from—see !
jest where that public-’ouse stands. Why, I do
b’lieve it’s the same. Reg’lar English style, them
days. Tour orses, English coach, coachman, and
guard in a red coat and blowin’ a ’orn. Some-
times the officer swells’d drive. They used ter be
stuck up sometimes. More’n forty year ago. ”
We had got as far as Bridge-street, when he
stopped suddenly and laid his hand upon my arm.
“I do believe that there’s where the ole Guard-
’ouse was. Yes. An’ now I’ve got my bearins
w “ w,,er e thcb 7
was the bank that was cracked m a wonnerful
way.
He drew a long sigh, as of enjoyment. He
might have been an artist gazing upon some
glorious scene—sav Venice touched Tw the
glorious scene say Venice, touched by the
golden shafts of the rising sun—so ecstatic was
the gaze he fixed upon the building he referred
to.
“Yes,” he presently murmured, “ it’s th’ idem
tuckle spot. An’ right acrost th’ street from where
we’re standin’, young feller,” and here he hushed
his voice, “ was the ’ouse (next t’ a blacksmith’s
shop it was) where—er—them as did the job
, ' , _ , .. , , ~ , ,
started from. I hey drove right under th street,
an’got inter th’ bank, and collared such a swag
as was amazin’.”
The triumph which glowed in his blue eyes
might have animated some hero of battle or
r ...
splendid self-sacrifice.
“ And you were here then ?” I asked.
He glanced at me resentfully. “ How’d I know,
if I wasn’t?” he returned. “ I was here in 1812.
mi t i -i •, , u at ; •
Oh! I was lagged, right enough. No’casion to
make no bones ’bout that. That’s nothink ! Dam
good job, too, fer me an’ lots o’ others. Why—
but there, never mind. As I was sayin’, they
drove right under the street. An’there was the
guard-’ouse, not a hundred yards off. After it
was all over, some o’ th’ sodjers seemed ter remem-
ber they’d ’eard a tappin’ at nights. He ! he !
Oh, yes. An’ as I was sayin’, I was—l was in
Sydney at th’ time. Yes, I seen the tunnel they
drove— right acrosst th street! There was,” and
here he counted on his fingers, muttering the
while, “there was seven on ’em. Wonnerful!
They was that patient an’ careful, nobody sus-
pected them Worked night-time. One drove,
another ’anded along th’ dirt. That was the
worst gettin rid of th dirt. They used to carry
m % eir P o °ket-’andkerchers, sometimes
When they got inter th’bank there was no trouble.
The manager an clerk slep’ all through the time
they was collarnr the stuff. There wasn’t no
saf es them days. Ihe swag was m a sort o’strong
° Up board or closet, m boxes, easy opened. My
word ! such a heap o’shiners ! An’all took away
as easy as drinkin’ yer ’ealth ! ”
“Yes, but hold on,” I said. “How about the
person or persons who lived in the house they
started from ? ”
“ Nobody lived in th’ house. It was one of
them old whitewash cottages —fust built, you
know, in King’s or Collins’s time. You may see
the like, maybe, in up-country towns. An’ next
door was a blacksmith’s shop. The blacksmith —
well, he didn’t sleep on the premises. Besides —
well, anyway, he wasn’t suspected. He was a
’onest man. He was respectable. Founded one
o’ the fust fam’lies, he did—yes. And, o’ course,
he was reg’lar stunned when the thing was dis-
kivered. My word ! wasn’t there a talk ! An’
wasn’t the orthorities mighty brisk over it !_ All
the tickets in the distnck was mustered —me
among ’em. But nothin’ come of it, though a big
reward (.£5OO, I believe) was offered, and a free
pardon. They was all good men. There was only
one doubtful feller, and he died —fell inter the
water, or somethink; I forgit now. ”
Here he became silent for a few minutes, his
eyes slowly traversing the site of the adventure.
“You say they were all good men?” I observed.
“ Oert’nly. True as steel they was.”
“ Then they were known ?”
He looked up quickly. “Hum ! —ah ! —well, I
suppose so. Anyways, I knowed’em. They say
as stolen money never prospers them as takes it.
That’s a lie. There was seven on ’em. One died,
as I said before—he used to drink ; and drinkers
talk, don’t they ? The other six got on well with
the start the money give ’em. Some on ’em
founded fam’lies—first fam’lies. Yes. One on
’em started in the—well, never mind ; he started
in bizness. I seen him standin’ at his shop-door
this mornin’, looking as respectable as a bishop.
He didn’t know me —he, he ! eh !■ —hum ! —but why
should he ? Though I’d known him, o’ course.
We all knew each other in them days. Yes, yes.
It’s a long time ago. More’n forty years ! ”
“ That’s about the time you crossed the moun-
tains and went farming ? ”
A quick gleam from the blue eyes. “ Well,
yes; little time after. It’s a long time ago.
More ’n forty year. But, I say ” —this with quite
a new manner—“let’s have a drink, an’ then you
come out along o’ me to the Show’, an I’ll show
you my pig ! ”
OLD JACK.
THE LAST MUSTER.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
ALL day we had driven the starving sheep
to the scrub where the axes ply,
And the weakest had lagged upon weary
feet and dropped from the ranks to die,
And the crows flew up from the rotting heaps and
the ewes too weak to stand,
And the fences flaunted red skins, like flags, and
the dour drought held the land.
And at night as I lay a-dreaming, I woke, and a
silver moon
Shone fair on a dancing river and laughed to a
broad lagoon,
And the grass turned over the fences and rippled
like ripening grain,
And clouds hung low on the hill tops and the earth
smelt sweet with the rain.
And in at the open window the lowing of cattle
came—
A mob that had never a laggard and never a beast
that was lame;
And wethers, a thousand thousand, and ewes with
their lambs beside
Moved over the green flats feeding, spread, river
to ranges, wide.
And horses whinnied below me, and, leaning I
watched them pass,
Lusty and strong and playful like horses on spring-
tide grass
When they whinny one to another, strong-voiced,
and a gallop brings
Foam to the flank, be it only from paddock to
stockyard wings.
Slowly they moved in the moon-mist, heads low
in the cool night-dew,
Snatching the long bush grasses, breast-high, as
they wandered through;
Slowly they moved in the moon-mist, and never a
horse on the plains
Was red with a gall of the collar, or marked with
a chafe of the chains.
And behind them a hundred drovers rode slow on
their horses white,
All brave with their trappings of silver that flashed
in the silver light,
Buckle and stirrup and bridle and spurs for their
better speed—
Singing behind the cattle like drovers on royal
feed.
And I coo-eed and one came over that rode on the
nearest wing,
And I called to him, “Ho! there, drover; say,
whose is the mob you bring ? ”
And he reined his horse by the window, all silver-
bitted and shod,
And he spoke, and his words rang sadly : “ These
are the cattle of God. ”
So I said to him, “ Where are they bound for?”
and he raised his hand to the West :
“ They are bound for the star-fenced pastures, on
God’s own rivers to rest.”
And I asked him, “Where did you muster ? ” and
he answered me sadly again :
“From every sandhill and gully, from every
valley and plain,
From the swamps of the green Kapunyah, from
the reeds at the red oreeksido.
From the thickets of twisted mulga, from the clay-
pans furrowed and dried,
From the tracks to the western goldfields, from
the ruts of the great North Road,
Where the dingoes go and the crows fly low, we
have gathered the beasts of God. ”
And I said: “ Then has God repented because
that He sent no rain ?
And has God looked down in His pity on the poor
dumb beasts He has slain ? ”
But the drover turned in his saddle and answered,
his eyes in mine,
“ Not so ; for the beasts were slaughtered by man
of his greed’s design ;
God gave to them feed and water and pastures so
wild and wide
They had fed him a thousand million from here to
the Ocean Side,
And man in his greed came after and fenced them
bn hill and plain,
And cursed their God in His heaven that would
not send them His rain ;
And man’s be the blame of the bleaching bone and
the shame of the rotting hide,
And the pity of lorn lambs crying alone on the
windswept mountain-side,
Of the weak horse down in the harness of tlm
bullock dead by the dray,
Of the moan of the thirsty cattle for ever and ever'"
and aye ! ”
And he spoke to his steed and left me : moved out
on the mist, it seemed,
And 1 woke to the red burnt acres, and knew that
T had but dreamed.
WILL H. OGILA[?]E.


The Soul of David King
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
All eyes were on him, the young preacher, hope
and mainstay of the Tarna branch of the Exclusive
Christians. His face was a peculiar one of the
type that looks masculine on a woman, feminine
on a man. His cheeks were perpetually flushed;
his eyes blue, and rather full. His whole aspect
had a brightness that seemed to lighten up the
grey, dingy room, and its common —very common
occupants.
A HORTICULTURAL ITEM.
THE HARDUP LODGER : “I have already told you that I have not
yet received my salary.”
LANDLADY: “I knows nothink about your celery —wot I wants is
my beans!”
Elate—as muoh an anomaly in her way as he
seemed in his —Kate, with the small, keen face,
eyes wide-open, mouth a-line, watched him with
more interest than her evident intellectuality
would seem to warrant. But Kate was not
looking at the preacher. It was the man that
interested her.
Catherine Bartleman was a comparatively new
auditor at the meeting-house. She was a journalist
plus music-teacher, and came, on her “ off ” days,
for “copy.” They were certainly amusing, these
Exclusives. The ten minutes before service had
been beguiled by listening to the round-faced girl
behind telling her companion how the Lord had
chastened her. She had been a little proud in her
heart that morning, but on her way to meeting a
little boy had “cheeked” her.
She had immediately burst into
tears and acknowledged the Lord’s
chastening hand. The humour of
this sort of thing was evident, but
somehow Kate could never include
David King in her laughter. She
could not listen to his raptures
without an unaccustomed wonder
and awe. This was even before
she thought of loving him. She
did not know whether she loved
him now or not, but she was glad
she knew him personally. She
was pleased to think that he
would soon be seeing her home in
the sweet windy twilight of that
Maoriland township.
She knew his story. Who did
not ? The only child of a Metho-
dist mother and a drunken father.
The father was, happily, dead;
the mother, still living, lived also
again in her son. When Kate
thought of pruning her future hus-
band’s religiousness, she always
expressed it mentally as “educa-
ting the mother out of him. ”
But not too much! She must
be careful of that. She had heard
—as many of the Exclusives had
not —that, of a considerable legacy
left him, David King devoted the
interest to Dr. Barnardo and the
China Inland Mission. Kate had
all the intellectual woman’s scorn
of the China Inland Mission, also
all the ordinary woman’s admira-
tion of the man who could do a
thing like this and say nothing
about it.
‘ ‘ I like your meetings—-better.
She was out in the street now
with him, followed by the envious
glances of divers Exclusive
maidens. ‘ ‘ But, there, what does
it matter? I know what these
small communities are at heart”
she shrugged her shoulders
‘ ‘ the quarreling gossiping
public exhortations of one an-
other !”
“But we are not ruled by one
another’s opinions ! ” His bright
face grew vivid with enthusiasm ;
his clear, bell-like voice rang out
incisively. “Not by any law;
not by anything except that inner
voice which speaks to every child
of God. There is nothing of eccle-
siasticism in our faith, Miss Bar-
tleman.” .
She looked at him musingly,
translating his id i. /ins into hers.
“Each to be guided by his own
conscience!” she said slowly;
then, decidedly: “Yes, that is
what we want nowadays.”
they paused at the gate she held out her hand
“ Good-bye, Mr. King.”
“Good-bye,” he answered; his bright, quick
glance rested on her a moment, and he was gone.
He was feeling very happy that evening, but the
happiness had nothing to do with Kate Bartle-
man. Happy he always was, with that boyish
gaiety and vigor which the Salvation Army has
engrafted on modern Methodism ; but there were
times, in solitude —of such periods he could never
speak—when his soul seemed to lose itself in a
maze of spiritual rapture. These were his feel-
ings now.
He sat in his room, half study, half bedroom.
On the other side of the wall the sweet-faced
mother was tidying-up the
homely kitchen. He could
hear her humming “Rock
of Ages, ” while she worked.
As the dark threads of
twilight were woven closer
David awoke from his re-
verie. The white - globed
lamp was on the bare table
before him. He lit it, and
then walked absently across
the rough matting to the
bookcase. This was a new
importation. It had come
with William Johnson’s
legacy to “my esteemed
young friend, David King.”
But David was no reader ;
not even of religious works.
As he casually took down
a volume of Josephus, he
smiled to think they had
never been touched since his
mother had arranged them,
unopened, on their arrival
some months ago. Softly
whistling, he flicked open
the yellow-brown leaves, and
as he did so a thin sheaf of
blue foolscap fell to the
ground. All unwitting, he
picked it up. The super-
scription ran “ Last Will
and Testament of William
Johnson.”
David’s whistle broke off
abruptly. The will by which
he had received his legacy
was written towards the
end of 1895—he remembered
that —and this (he looked at
it as if he could look the
words away) was dated
February, 1896.
Little time was needed to
read this will. It left to the
“friend and companion,
David King, two hundred
pounds ; ” the remainder to
Catherine Bartleman, the
young cousin of whose exist-
ence the testator had but
lately heard. The will, duly
witnessed and signed, had
lain hidden by some strange mischance all these
months.
So the bulk of that little fortune, the in-
terest of which went to God’s work throughout the
world, was not his at all, but the property of Kate
Bartleman —a stranger ; a girl of doubtful re-
ligious convictions, who would spend it on worldli-
ness.
“ Cast thy burden upon the Lord ! ” The words
came to him with healing calm as he stood there,
shaken and irresolute, in the dim lamplight.
“What shall I do?” burst from him as he
threw himself on his knees beside the bed. What
was the Lord’s will in this matter ? With sincere
faith he asked it. Was he to give up this for-
tune to the rightful owner, or keep it for God’s
work ? A long time he wrestled, listening for a
voice—a sign. At last he rose, took his well-worn
Bible from the shelf, and,
having uttered a brief
petition, opened it at hap-
hazard.
“Ye shall spoil the
Egyptians ! ”
He said the words aloud,
softly shutting the volume.
His face grew serene.
With a word of thanks-
giving that all had been
made clear, he passed out
to rejoin his mother in the
other room.
* * *
“I found this in one of
the books you lent me.”
Catherine Bartleman’s eyes
burned with passion, but
her voice was calm. “Wil-
liam Johnson’s will ; my
cousin’s will. No; don’t
say you didn’t know of it.
You did know. You
have used the back page
to scribble notes about a
Bible-class meeting!”
Her lip curled.
“I wasn’t intending to
deny it,” he answered,
softly, his bright eyes
meeting hers.
She gave a little sob.
“You, of all men, to
yield to such a temptation,
David ! And I was so
happy ! ” She touched the
engagement-ring on her
finger, as if to tear it
off. “A temptation like
this—such a mean, hor-
rible temptation ! ”
She cried bitterly, yet
not with absolute hope-
lessness ; her idol had
fallen, but it could be
raised once more. He had
yielded to temptation, but
she was too experienced not to know how little
that might have to do with his real character.
Yet the blow was severe. “ How could you,
David? How could .” Then she stopped, for
she had looked up, and his face, she thought, was
like the face of an angel. ,
Then he poured out his soul to her. He told
her, in low, earnest tones, of the discovery of a
few months ago; he painted, in graphio words,
that long hour’s wrestling with God, till the sign
was at last vouchsafed. He would not say he
might not have acted mistakenly. He supposed,
with a note of dreaminess in his voice, that the
Lord sometimes permitted even His own to fall,
that they might more fully realize their depend-
ence on the Spirit. It was all a mystery.
And, as Kate listened, she understood, and her
heart sank. This had been no yielding to sudden
temptation; it was the outcome of a nature in
which the moral was so utterly rotted by the
theological that recovery was all but hopeless. He
could not even see the meanness of his attempt
as the commonest worldling would have seen it
to rob her, a woman! His fault was to him
simply a “chastening,” a “dispensation.” In so
far as it was a sin, it was against God —God only.
No thought of her !
And this was the man she loved ! Must she
give him up; give up the bright young manhood
so appealing to her more reserved nature ? For
one dizzy moment the answer came —Yes ! Then
the straight forehead and the linelike mouth
asserted themselves. Give him up ! Never ! She
would fight with God for him —and win !
“David!” she said, “listen. You must give
up God. You must! There’s no hope for you
otherwise. He’s—He’s having a bad effect on
you. Most men aren’t safe away from Him ; but
it’s not so with you. Oh ! David, can’t you see .
He has no right to give you dispensations from
common honesty !
“ IGNORANCE—NOT BLISS. ”
HE (a cockatoo): “ What’s the matter with the little fellow? ”
BARRABOGIL MARYANNE : “Baal mine knowit.”
H E: “ Just give him a little drink of kerosene .”
B.M. (after pause): “Baal mine knowit how you lightem!”
“ David ! ” —she came nearer to him, her gaze
steadying as it met his. “I know you love me
now, though you did not at first when I began
to love you. You would not like to lose me.”
His eyelids quivered. “ But ’’—her voice rang out
with sudden clearness of contempt—“ I will never
marry the thing you are now ! I am going away,
David—quite away from here. Thank heaven I
have money to do that, now. And you will not
see me again for a year. You will never see me
again until you have dropped the priest and
become the man. David, keep from praying for
a single year, and you will be safe.”
* * * *
She searched him out; she, the comparatively
rich woman, newly returned from her trip to Aus-
tralia. That she had to seek him out she felt was
a hopeful sign. He had moved from his old house,
and was living in quite a different part of the
town.
She had wondered how he would meet her. Ihe
reality was one of her wonderings, yet she won-
dered at it all the same.
He turned away from her almost roughly.
“ Why did you come?” His eyes did not meet
hers. “I beg your pardon; it’s only too good of
you to take notice of such a cad as I am.”
“ Oh, David ! ” The virile tone roused in her a
mingled joy and pain. Her gaze wandered over
his face. His color was deepened ;he had grown
a beard. There was strength in his bearing.
“I’ve no right to let you speak to me. You
ought to have gaoled me, Kate. But I haven’t
been to meeting for a year—give you my word for
it!” He laughed. “Funny, a wife making her
husband swear off church instead of the pub. !
I’ve no right to speak of you as my wife; but
you’re the sort of woman that would rather marry
the meanest scamp she did love than ”
They were married a month later, and went to
Auckland for their honeymoon. Kate was very
happy, and in the new life of little services David
was happy, too. But when they were home again,
his interest slackened. The old fund of brightness
and energy was gone. . i r , ,
Some stimulant seemed to be lacking. He had
never cared for intellectual pursuits, and now the
world was flat, stale, unprofitable. Sometimes
the broadened, coarser-tinted face seemed strangely
unfamiliar to his wife. Then her thoughts would
go back to the bright-eyed fellow of more than a
year ago. And she would wonder,
Then a second change came over him, and at
times he was his old, bright, animated self. He
talked and laughed like one that felt no moment
a burden, and she laughed with him, glad at
heart, and proud also. For had she not won ?
But the victory was another’s.
She was sitting in the drawing-room one even-
ing, waiting for his return. She started when she
heard his footsteps; he was noisier than usual.
He stumbled against a footstool as he entered ;
his face flushed, his lips curved smilingly, his
voice . .
‘ ‘ David 1 ” She broke in on his speech with a
frightened cry.
He held a bottle towards her, and laughed
loudly. “ I’ve—got the —shtimulant —wanted.
Been doing—me lotsh of good—theshe —lasht four
five days—my— ” Then he knocked against the
sofa, and subsided on it in a heap.
And Kate sat by the table, motionless, like a
figure of stone. Before her stood two photos.—
one of David’s mother, the religious enthusiast,
the other of his father, the drunkard.
She had vowed to conquer the mother’s here-
dity, and she had succeeded.
But it was the father’s that had him now.
“ Rum—or true religion ! ”

THE N.S.W. PARCELS-POST SYSTEM. -A BUSH POSTMAN.
(From, a suggestion by an indignant country storekeeper.)


Two Points of View.
[FOR THE BULLETIN. ]
I. 1 )’ the beginning of his life there was one ever be-
side mm with an infinite energy for tenderness.
She had fanciful, pretty ways, too, wore loose
curls upon her forehead, and delighted in dainty
fripperies. bhe knew love-songs and lullabies
and crooning stories of fairies and imps, and
would sing him to sleep of nights, holding his feet
in her hands, and tripping it lightly in her rock-
ing chair.
She slipped away from him before his tongue
Inid mastered the intricacies of “ th ” ; in the days
whep she was only “muvver,” and he her “laddie.”
While yet he was crying over her long delaying
in answering his nightly calling ; while yet he was
wondering over the words they, the wiser ones,
were telling him—which varied amazingly and
according to the moods of the speakers—from the
graceful ones of a girl, “ God wanted another angel
to sing to Him and beckoned to muvver,” to the
chill-striking ones of his father, “Mother is dead.
Put-away :n the cold ground.” While yet he was
thinking upon these tilings, there slipped into her
place, another.
a theory about the dead girl-mother,
to ° —“ lam your mother come back to you.” So
that it passed into the child’s mind that after
singing to God his mother had undergone a meta-
morphosis whereby all songs and lovely ways
had left her.
He asked her pathetically, and at different
times—“ How she got up through the ground ?
“ if she had sung God the story about Pat-a-cake,
Pat-a-cake ? ’ ; “if she had left the rocking-chair
in Heaven?”
For it, like many other things, had slipped from
his sight. The fripperies he missed the most, so
that, at times, his heart ached sorely for the little
old man in the gay hat who lived by the clock on
the mantelpiece ; the silver angel who swung from
the chandelier over every meal-table ; the brown
shell which held the sound of the sea within it—
and used to stay close beside the old man and the
clock.
This new mother who came from God, in all
essentials different from the one who went to Him,
brought back wonderful things with her ; as, for
instance, woolly mats, birds and butterflies and
flowers under glass shades, some new dresses for
the drawing-room chairs, and a very large Bible.
She had rigid words and ways—“ A place for
everything, and everything in its place”; “little
boys should be seen and not heard”; “work
first, and play after”; “spare the rod and spoil
the child.”
And he grew up under the light of her counten-
ance—which was a very dusky light indeed—and
the ache went out of his heart and the wonder-
ment out of his mind. And he learnt that God
sends others than those He has taken, to fill the
dear empty places, and that, of all the singers He
has summoned to sing to Him, He has never sent
one back again, even though rocking-chairs gape
for ever and small hearts break.
And he grew up and called it a very good
arrangement of Providence to save the world from
topsy-turveydom.
He was thirty-three Deiore tenderness came
again into his life.
He found her ; a bright woman, half-bird, half-
flower, with sunshiny hair and eyes and laughter.
She had been astray in the world just long enough
to make her love the glow of a hoine-fire. She
was twenty-one when he found her, trying to fill
her heart with love for small pupils, who were
given to-day and taken away to-morrow. She
had been to three dances, one matinee, two con-
certs and fifty-seven school-breakings-up.
His father and step-mother shook disparaging
heads over her.
“A bit of a frivolous, flighty school-girl.”
“Flirty—without religion or principle or common-
sense,” were their respective verdicts.
And she, lacking knowledge of other ways to
win them, made soft eyes at them both. One
older in diplomacy might have urged her to
speculate in down-dropping mouth corners, and a
jrunes-and-prisms expression of countenance.
She told them confidingly—“My name is
dreadful! You couldn’t guess it, could you?
Well—l’ll tell you. It’s Martha I Doesn’t it
make you shiver? I’m called Mimi. That’s
better, isn’t it? Wouldn’t you have hated to be
saying Martha ? ”
“ Your baptismal name is good enough forme,”
said the stepmother. “It is a sensible name. Do
you know anything of cooking, or housework,
or plain sewing, Martha ? ”
Martha knew nothing ; not even the names of
the different brooms and brushes ; the soaps which
wash clothes, and those which clean silver and
boards ; the stuff they put on stoves, and the stuff
they put on steps.
And her husband only had £250 a year ! People
pitied him.
His stepmother found him one day cleaning out
the kitchen stove, the servant having departed
the previous day. Martha, otherwise Mimi, was
sitting upon the table telling him the servant’s
love-story. He was laughing over it, certainly, as
his stepmother entered, but as she declared after-
wards, his forehead was all “puckered up.”
Martha’s smile was serene and unashamed.
“ I’ve been learning all about flues and dampers
and things,” she said, “and why a stove won’t
burn, and where soot accumulates. Haven’t I,
Nick?”
His name was Nicholas, and it may be cited as
a proof of her absence of nice feeling that she had
been heard to call him “ Old Nick.”
Frequently he went to office with forehead-
puckers. His little girl-wife had ear-ache, or
toothache, or headache ; sometimes she had sore-
throat, sometimes shooting pains in her limbs ;
frequently she was feverish, with scarlet lips and
brilliant eyes.
He would come home again, with a dread in his
heart that someone would meet him with a warn-
ing, upraised finger; that a doctor would be wait-
ing for him with a grave face —and she would
spring out from behind a bush or a tree or the
half-opened hall-door, bubbling with laughter, to
wind her arms round his neck and cry, “My old
Nick ! ” She never learned to cook, although she
drew up elaborate menus, and tried very hard.
She said she “ hadn’t cooking fingers.”
Her servants had frequently even less culinary
knowledge than she herself. She chose them for
their faces.
“ Such a sad-faced woman, Nick, dear. She
looks as though she has suffered. But she shall
be happy.” Or: “Such a nice-eyed girl, Nick.
I’d never be afraid to ask her to do anything. She
can’t cook —-but she’s willing to learn.”
At last it was arranged that Nicholas should
dine in town—one dozen tickets for 7s. 6d.
But, previous to that, she gave one dinner to her
father-and-mother-in-law. Ribbons, mirrors,
flowers, fairy-lamps and fantastio-looking ser-
viettes were on the table—the waiting-maid wore
flying streamers and walked jauntily. The menu
consisted of julienne soup, oyster pates, roast
chicken and green peas, pine-apple sponge and
almonds and raisins.
And Martha wore a blue silk blouse and called
her husband Nick openly. Moreover she told
them the shocking story of the little boy (“ a
pupil of mine,” she said) who at table with a
bishop, and hearing “No, my lord,” &c., wished
excessively to be polite. “And he said,” said
Martha, bubbling with laughter: “ ‘Father, God
wants some more potato.’ What do you think of
that, father-in-law ? ”
Only Nicholas laughed. Mimi, seeing the
ominous mouth-corners and gloomy faces, grew
grave, and changed the subject.
“ Have you a good stove ? Have you ever no-
ticed how many sorts of brushes there are?
There’s the carpet-broom and the millet-broom.
The crumb-brush and the blackleading-brush.
The scrubbing-brush and the—would you call a
mop a broom? (I’m getting on—ami not? To-
morrow I’m going to learn-up about tins.) ”
But in spite of her new knowledge the dinner
was a failure, only the oyster pates being eatable.
And they were bought—“ ready made.”
She grew terribly frivolous when a tiny Nicholas
came to the home She tripped about the house
like a dancing sprite, twittered away like a small
ground-sparrow, and dressed and undressed her
tiny plaything fully half a-dozen times a day.
Nicholas the elder learned nursery rhymes.
He told the story of the five little pigs ; he knew
exactly what to do when his small son choked,
and what not to do when he cried. He got up
and jerked him in the middle of the night; and
he came home mid-day on Saturday and gam-
bolled on the verandah with him.
And people pitied him vastly. Others smiled at
him.
When little Nick was two, another tender
woman was called to “sing to God”; another
rocking-chair stood empty ; another home gaped.
She was twenty-four and frivolous and flighty
when she died. She had never learned to walk
sedately. She never ceased her singing till death
beckoned—even in her last solemn hour she made
soft eyes.
* * * *
Nicholas was 37 when he took unto himself a
second wife (a distant connection of his step-
mother’s).
She was small and sad-looking, with pathetic
eyes and a square chin —and her name was Nellie.
In every way she was different from Martha.
She knew all about brushes and soaps, and ser-
vants, and dinners, and stoves. All about hus-
bands and children. What to do in emergencies,
and what not to do. She was never ill to need
tending ; she never gave him a badly-cooked
dinner. And she never needed his advice. She
made splendid Home Rules —instituted family
prayers ; never chose a servant for the sake of her
face ; never coaxed, or danced, or twittered, and
never made soft eyes.
She walked by her husband’s side to church ;
called him, consistently, Nicholas ; and had toys
and rhymes and stories “kept in their place in the
nursery.”
He lived up to her for a long while, and in their
first year together he saved thirty pounds. He
might have saved more, and
climbed high up to the dais
whereon she moved -only for
a Sunday that fell into his
life—and a Sunday sleep.
In the morning he had
been to church with his wife
and child, his father and
step-mother. In the early
part of the afternoon he had
read aloud the regulation
Bible story. Home Rules
set out that after the story
he should don hat and coat,
and take his wife and child
for a walk. Instead, he
leaned back in his chair and
his head fell forward.
His wife regarded him
critically.
“You have a nervous
headache coming on,” she
said. “You must have a
powder, and put your pipe
away.”
He fell listlessly in with
her ways. “Then you must
go to sleep,” she said. “I
will pull the blinds down
and no one shall disturb
you. To-night you will be
ready for church as usual.”
So he went to sleep. And
in his sleep she came back
to him his little, flighty
wife who had slipped away
to “ sing to God.”
She nestled up close,
leaned her head on his
shoulder, and whimpered
that she had “ such a dread-
ful ear-ache and had come to
be cured.”
His memory instantly sug-
gested warm-oil and tobacco-
wnoke- -and he rose.
The room was dim, and
he was alone. He looked
round for the small com-
plaining woman whose very
ear he had seen distinctly.
He caught, his breath, remem-
bering her pout of pain,
and a groan burst from him
and he stretched out his
arms. Could he never wait
on her, soothe her, help her,
any more?
"Wild thoughts surged in
his mind. He remembered
he had a “ nervous headache
coming on,” and was shut-
up to be ready for evening
church—by his wife.
Then a strange smile settled
upon his face. He took out
a piece of paper and scrawled
upon it, “Tired of Life,”
and went to his bed-room.
* * *
“ He never had a home-
worry,” said his weeping
widow. “We never quar-
relled. We had no debts . . .
there were no business
troubles. I think his first
wife unhinged his brain.”
And people pitied him—
and remembered afresh the
manner of woman she had
been.

COULDN’T KISS HER.
(FOR THE BULLETIN.]
It was the place, the hour,
The music's dreamy strains within were failing
To tkeir soft close ; sweet perfumes were exhaling
From ihc dark daphne's flower.
It was the time, the spot.
Her lifting breast betrayed her blood'sguich movin ’
Her drooping lids could hide no glance unloving
And yet I ventured not.
It was the hour, the place.
Why did 1 not avow my stormy passion !
Why did I sit, in such a foolish fashion,
With an averted face ?
It was the spot, the time,
A nd any synonym that you can think of.
Why was it that I lingered at the brink of
A certain joy sublime ?
Ah, why ? It's no use bluffing.
When at the Spanish cafe I had dined, '
flow could the waiter know that I would mind
The garlic in the stuffing ?

The Stranger’s Friend.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
The strangest things, and the maddest things,
that a man can do or say,
To the chaps and fellows and coves Out Back are
matters of every day ;
Maybe on account of the lives they lead, or the
life that their hearts discard—-
But never a fool can be too mad nor a “hard-
case ” be too hard.
I met him in Bourke in the Union days—with
which we have nought to do
(Their creed was narrow, their methods crude,
but they stuck to “ the cause ” like glue).
He came into town from the Lost Soul Run for
his grim half-yearly “bend,”
And because of a curious hobby he had, he was
known as “The Stranger’s Friend.”
It is true to the region of adjectives when I say
that the spree was “grim,”
For to go on the spree was a sacred rite, or
a heathen rite, to him ;
To shout for the travellers passing through to the
land where the lost soul bakes —
Till they all seemed devils of different breeds, and
his pockets were filled with snakes.
In the joyful mood, in the solemn mood—in his
cynical stages too—
In the maudlin stage, in the fighting stage, in the
stage when all was blue —
From the joyful hour when his spree commenced,
right through to the awful end,
He never lost grip of his “fixed idee” that he was
the Stranger’s Friend.
“The feller as knows, he can battle around for
his bloomin’ self,” he’d say—
“l don’t give a curse for the ‘blanks ’ I know—
send the hard-up bloke this way ;
“Send the stranger round, and I’ll see him
through,” and, e’en as the bushman spoke,
The chaps and fellers would tip the wink to a
casual, “ hard-up bloke.”
And it wasn’t only a bushman’s “bluff” to the
fame of the Friend they scored,
For he’d shout the stranger a suit of clothes, and
he’d pay for the stranger’s board —
The worst of it was that he’d skite all night on the
edge of the stranger’s bunk,
And never get helplessly drunk himself till he’d
got the stranger drunk.
And the chaps and the fellers would speculate—by
way of a ghastly joke—
As to who’d be caught by the “jim-jams ” first—
the Friend or the hard-up bloke ?
And the “ Joker ” would say that there wasn’t a
doubt as to who’d be damned in the end,
When the Devil got hold of a hard-up bloke in the
shape of the Stranger’s Friend.
It mattered not to the Stranger’s Friend what the
rest might say or think,
He always held that the hard-up state was due to
the curse of drink
To the evils of cards, and of company: “But a
young cove’s built that way,
And I was a bloomin’ fool meself when I started
out, ” he’d say.
At the end of the spree, in clean white “moles,”
clean-shaven, and cool as ice,
He’d give the stranger a “ bob ” or two, and some
straight Out Back advice;
Then he’d tramp away for the Lost Soul Run,
where the hot dust rose like smoke,
Having done his duty to all mankind, for he’d
“stuck to a hard-up bloke.”
They’ll say ’tis a “ song of a sot,” perhaps, but the
Song of a Sot is true.
I have “battled” myself, and you know, you
chaps, what a man in the bush goes through ;
Let us hope when the last of his sprees is past,
and his cheques and his strength are done,
That, amongst the sober and thrifty mates, the
Stranger’s Friend has one.

Three Men and a Woman.
AN ESOTERIC TRAGEDY.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
“The sun!” was the hypothesis to which the
doctor found himself compelled by the difficulty of
otherwise accounting for this sudden collapse of an
unlaborious brain, backed by rude health and an
undamaged nervous system.
“No sensitive plant, this,” he said to himself.
“A lusty, large-muscled, small-brained, coarse-
fibred, magnificent young animal. Therefore, it
must be the sun —and a bad case, too.”
But it was not the sun.
• * * *
Gloomily—amidst gloomy surroundings—the
three sat by their cooking-fire, not far from which
the charcoal-furnace, neglected for to-day, smoul-
dered sullenly and black, with only here and there
a small red eye of incandescence that was fiercer
for the greyness of the day. The wind made
dismal, intermittent pipings amongst the black-
wood and messmate that thickly clothed the
slopes ascending on every side from the hollow m
which worked the brothers, who had, till yester-
day, been four.
The eldest—he was Ercole, of 40 years or so—a
very tall man, massive to hugeness, and with skin
not much less swarthy than the tangle of beard
that grew almost up to his gloomy eyes. With
black hair also, but with trimmed and pointed
beard—the smaller Steffano, lean, fierce, and
strenuous, made powerful contrast with the plump
and oleaginous third brother —Baldovino, by name
—beady-eved, with shaven chin, skin of sickly
olive, and the imprint of a customary sneer about
the wings of a shapely, aquiline nose.
Baldovino was the first to catch a sound which
next moment announced itself also to the others
as the footfall of a horse. It was a sound not
common there, and all three turned their heads
and looked, until round the curve in the track
appeared a woman on horseback —a tall young
woman, high-colored and assertive-looking, on a
showy, long-tailed chestnut. Instantly they re-
cognised her —but only a single word was spoken.
“ Diavolessa ! ” Steffano muttered as he half-rose
from the log and sat down again.
“She-devil!” Well, to the acuter student of
mankind, possibilities of something in that way
would doubtless have been visible in the degree
to which this young woman’s lower jaw prepon-
derated over features otherwise rather insignifi-
cantly small, and in the over-proximity to each
other of eyes which it could not, for all that, be
denied were “deeply, darkly, beautifully blue.”
Her figure—like the red-gold hair—was pleasingly
abundant, and, altogether, the unascetic Baldo-
vino, as she rode boldly up to the fire, was in-
clined to wonder much less than his brothers at
the infatuation which had done to death the
youngest of them all. But, for all that, it was he
—unctuous tiger that he was —who meant, for this
woman, the greatest danger of the three.
“ Yes, Miss Hockheimer, I have enjoyed myself so
much. I almost feel inclined to embrace
Judaism.”
“ Well, Mr. Dickie, you are embracing it.”
“ Ahem! shall we try the balcony? ”
But not of danger was she thinking, as, dis-
mounting with the celerity of the bush eques-
trienne, she tucked her habit-skirt over her arm
and stood up before them—cool, determined and
business-like.
“ I eanfe,” she said, “to get back my ring.”
In-n'iringly the eldest brother turned towards
the others.
“ Yes ! ” Baldovino said, in Italian—nodding
towards the hut—“ there is a ring on his finger.
I .suppose it’s hers. Is she to have it ? ”
“To have it?” put in Steffano, with rapid
passion. “ She gave him a ring! She led him
on ! She betrayed him !—murdered him !—our
poor young Luigi ! And, is she to have the ring ?
—you ask ! I know what she should have !I ”
lie ceased with the abruptness of a man putting a
violent check on violent emotion, and Ercole,
tugging at his portentous beard, nodded twice or
thrice.
“She shall have what she deserves, he answered,
in slow, bass tones. “ But not in haste. She has
brought destruction upon ” —his big voice trembled
for a moment —“our youngest —our far-off old
mother’s favorite ! But she shall have a chance to
say what she can for herself. She may not be so
much to blame, after all. Luigi, poor boy, was
ever ready to take fire, and this girl is very fair to
look upon. , ,
“ She is ! ” said Steffano— ■“ ma, la bellezza e la
crudelita vanno spesso in compagnial The more
beautiful, the more cruel ! ”
Then the woman—unconscipus of the atmo-
sphere of grim tragedy that was gathering
about her —made a point against herself.
“Look here!” she said, in a voice that
curiously combined with the high Aus-
tralian aridity the deliquescent paternal
brogue—“l’m in a hurry! I came for
me ring! Just let me have it, will ye,
without any more palaver ! Ye all
speak English well enough; so
it’s no use pretendin’ ye don’t
understand me.”
Baldovino, with a deadly
smile which would have
warned an acuter woman,
stood up and spread
out deprecatory
hands.
“ Oh, yais, young
ladee ! ” he said,
in suavely - in-
flected English
—“ we unner-
sta n’ you
verree well.
But, z e
reeng—zis
reeng you

DECEIVED!
“ An ’ only to—to think that
yesterday ’e said as we was made for
each other !"
brotSdait —vat for you vant it back again, now,
eh ? ”
“ That’s my business ! ” —-with an angry flush
and a firmer grasp of the whip.
“Excuse me,” Steffano put in, with no pecu-
liarities in his English worth indicating—“ you
gave the ring to —to him” —and he pointed
towards the hut. “And what was his is now
ours; therefore it is right that we should know
why you want this ring back again.”
The words were civil
enough, but something
contemptuous in the
man’s eye stung her into
the facile Milesian exas-
peration.
“Oh, well,” she said,
with an insolent laugh,
“if you’re so mighty
anxious to know—l want
it for the other fella ! ”
The eldest brother, who
knew the least of Eng-
lish, looked for elucida-
tion to the others, and
Baldovino translated.
“ Ha ! ” the giant said —
got up slowly, and walked
ponderously to the hut—-
the woman, who had
never seen him close at hand before,
taking to herself, for the first time,
a vague uneasiness at the sight of his
immense proportions. “ He’d make
six of Luigi ! ” she said to herself. “ I
suppose he is in there ! ”
He was; brought thither immedi-
ately after the inquest ; and reverently,
now, the eldest brother was raising the
covering from the suicide’s slight form.
The ring was there, upon the pallid
left hand —a little thing of turquoises
and garnets —and for half-a-minute
Ercole stood, thinking, in the darkened
hut. Then, with a flood of early
recollections, his heart hardened sud-
denly and desperately against the soul-
less creature whom this boy had loved
even to death, and who now, before
the earth had covered him, had the
callous brutality to demand, for another
lover, the ring with which she had be-
trayed him. But the big man’s face,
as he stepped outside again, was a
blank the others could not read. He
would be just, he told himself. If this
woman deserved any mercy she should
have it. If not —the ferocity that
lay deep down in him surged for
an instant up, and a red mist
blotted for that instant from his
sight the face of the girl upon whom he now,
for the first time, turned full his sombre, un-
fathomable gaze.
“ Signorina you give—my broddair—von
reeng,” he said, pausing at every second word to
select his English. “In my con tree—dat mean—
you marree him ! ”
“Marry ? ” the girl repeated, with an appalling
unconsciousness that she was having a last chance
for her life. “ Look here, me good man—both
your brother an’ yourself was makin’ a mighty
big mistake if ye thought me father’s daughter
ever dreamt of marryin’ into a lot of beggarly
cinder-sifters from God-knows-where. Luigi was
a nice boy enough—but, as for the rest of ye
How far Miss Rafferty’s inherited vituperative
abilities might have carried her cannot be known,
for at this point Steffano, white with fury, inter-
rupted her with a rapid translation for the benefit
of the uncomprehending Ercole. “Is this
enough ? ” he concluded, with fiery natural elo-
quence—“ or shall we wait until this she-devil has
reviled the mother that bore us, as well as the
land that could never have produced such a thing
as she is ? Blood for blood, I say ! Ercole !
Baldovino! —the blood of this woman for the
! ilood of our brother ! ”
The woman took alarm at last. The impas-
sioned, “ Sangue per sangue / ” though she under-
stood not the words, had dashed suddenly in
upon her soul the conviction of her supreme folly
in wantonly outraging the feelings of these fierce,
outlandish men —already strung to dangerous in-
tensity by the self-murder of the brother she
had—well, she supposed she had led him on a bit.
At all events, it was time to get away from such
company. But, as she stepped hastily towards
her waiting horse, Baldovino’s voice—tuned to a
deceptive equanimity—made her pause.
“Signorina,” he said, suavely, “if you choose,
you may yait take ze reeng avay vis you. Aftair
all, it vould on lee be bury vis my poor brod-
dair. Ve no take it off ze fingair ourselves.
Dat is vy ve refuse you so mainee time.
But, if you like to take it off—dat is quite
aunozer thing. Ve not care ! ”
And then—while the woman stood hesi-
tating—like lightning a few words in Italian
flashed from brother to brother. If she were
capable of this crowning infamy, even Ercole
agreed, there should be no more talk of
mercy !
And the woman, marching blindfold
upon her fate, said presently that she
was ready, but that one of them must
accompany her into the hut.
“That will I!” Steffano said, grimly—and,
with a curious whiteness about his nostrils, he trod
softly after her into the gloom.
Even she, insensate as she was, stood shrinking
for a moment before she could lift the covering
from the dead man’s hand. Then a faint sparkle
showed her where the ring was. She set her lips
—took hold of the finger—and in an instant was
clutched fiercely by the throat and dragged out-
side again.
The giant, with his eyes aflame, stood savagely
expectant —Baldovino had seized upon the plung-
ing horse and the woman knew at last that
nothing less than her life was at stake ! The
sudden conviction reinforced her naturally unusual
strength, and for a brief space she held the man
with a grip that kept him from his knife. Then
Steffano’s right wrist wrenched itself loose, and
the steel had flashed out —when, with a growl of
“Not so !—not so ! ” the giant suddenly dragged
the pair apart as if they had been infants. But he
had not now any thought of sparing. His sluggish
blood had taken fire, and ho had determined that
the woman should die —though not by the knife.
Pipe in mouth, and seated on a log, he looked
stolidly on, while Baldovino, having secured the
horse, assisted Steffano to make fast the woman’s
ankles with a greenhide strip.
“ It is but a squeeze,” Ercole said to himseif, as
he looked from the round and milky neck to his
own colossal hand—“and the thing is done!
What is that for?” he called out, as Baldovino
set about replenishing the charcoal-furnace. “We

burn no more till he is buried ” —pointing to the
hut.
And Baldovino, with a horrible malignity in his
averted face, made answer that they would pro-
bably be obliged to burn something presently.
“ The body, he means,” the elder man told him-
self —uncomprehending, yet, how far in diabolical
savagery himself and Steffano were out-distanced
by this smooth, plump, silvery brother of theirs.
“And how then do you propose to do it?”
Baldovino asked, as, wiping the sweat from
his forehead, he came over to where Steffano was
vainly arguing with Ercole in favor of the use of
the knife.
“I would strangle her!” growled the giant-
“ That makes an end quickly.”
“ Not as quickly as a well-planted thrust in the
throat,” Steffano maintained ; and Baldovino
shook with laughter of the lowest hell.
“ Was not Luigi your brother as well as mine .
he said—“that you both talk of making an end
of this woman quickly. Not so mercifully would
I see her perish. But let the dice decide. Let
the highest thrower have his way in the matter •
that’s fair, at all events! ” _ t
“Bastal ” said the giant, impatiently. As
you will. Let us get it over ! ”
The fat fiend, as he returned from the hut witfi
the little cubes of Fate, paused beside the woman,
who had never, all this time, ceased to implore
mercy. (
“ Thair is no maircee for you !” he said, xou
mus’ die ! —but not, if I have my vay, as queeck
as my broddair who you make shoot heemsailf.
Ercole, he vant to shoke you ; and Steffano, he
say, stab you —so ve go play dice for see who have
his vay. And—if I vin ” —his horrible eyes, as he
pointed towards the rejuvenated furnace, told her
that he meant what he said —“you be bur-r-n
a-live 1”
With a shriek that echoed far away amongst the
tree-trunks, the miserable creature flung herself on
her face and lay moaning. Baldovino laughed
gently, and took the dice over to the other two.
“Come on!” said the giant, again. “Let us
get done with the thing ! A single throw, each ?
The others nodded ; Ercole rattled and threw.
“ Quattro 1” they oried together, as the four
turned up. “ A good throw ! ” added Steffano, as
he took the box in turn and threw only a two.
“It won’t be the knife, at all events ! ” said
Baldovino. “Let us now see whether strangling-
wins, or ” he threw a five.
“ Or what ? ” asked Ercole, as the winner paused!
upon the word.
“Or— fire/” said Baldovino, with a hideous,
smile.
“ It shall not be ! ” said Ercole.
“No!” Steffano added. “We are men, who
seek a life for a life —non diavoli incarnati! ”
“In questa cosa,” answered Baldovino, coolly 5
“in this matter, lam a ‘devil incarnate.’ And I
ask you, was it a bargain, or was it not, that
whichever ” —he stopped and turned hastily round,
for the woman was laughing.
Not hysterical laughter, nor any hollow Simula-
lx 1 -1 4- fl>n lie r»f \r
crum of merriment, but the hearty,
ringing peal of intense amusement.
The three men stared amazedly at her,
as, despite thedisableinent of her ankle-
bonds, she rolled ecstatically upon the
ground, and laughed and laughed again.
“ Cospetto! ” said the big man, at last, “ she has
escaped us all.”
In what way, Baldovino had no need to ask.
He had all the traditional Italian awe of
the mentally - afflicted—as being under
special Divine protection and this
woman’s mind, beyond all ques-
tion, had collapsed under the awful
strain to which it had been sub-
jected.
“It is God,” Baldovino said, in a
horrified half-whisper, “who has inter-
fered in her behalf. ”
IT' JLCJLCU. 111 lic-l MC-.IACHI.
“Or the devil ! ” said Ercole. Least cruel of
the three—he was also, almost as a necessary
corollary, least superstitious.
‘ I will put her on her horse and let her go,
Baldovino said, and, drawing his knife, he walked
over to the woman and severed the fastenings at
her ankles. She got up immediately, and looked
at him as if she had never seen him before.
“Have ye come to see me burned alive? ” she said
cheerfully, and, with another peal of laughter,
walked briskly over towards the furnace.
And then —such a curious animal is Man— it \va*,
Ercole and Steffano who sat still, while Baldoviw),..
with a frantic rush, was only just in time to (Lag
the lunatic away from the flames into which she,
was on the point of stepping..
“Take her to the horse,” Ercole said, “The-,
sight of him will change the turn of her thoughts.’’ -.
He was right. Placed beside the animal, the,
woman stood stroking his neck for a few moments*,
and then, suddenly gathering up her habit,,
climbed nimbly into the saddle, and rode slowly-
away up the track, bursting every half-minute or,-
so into a fresh convulsion of laughter.
The three men watched her out of sight, and!
then, as the last audible peal of mad merriment
came faintly back to them, Baldovino said—
“ Remember, we know nothing of this; we
haven’t seen her.”
“Fool! ” said the giant, “she will be tracked
hither. But all we have to say is that she came
here as mad as she went away.”
It turned out as he expected, and it was not till
several years later that this Ercole Arnold! —the
only one of the three brothers who appears to have
felt any lasting regret —put the case to me as a
supposititious one. “To what punishment would
the persons concerned be liable?” he wanted to--
know.
“To none,” I said, “ except for the assault in-
volved in the binding and detaining of the young
woman. The law could take no cognisance of a
man’s assertion that he had at one time entertained
certain criminal intentions which he took no steps
to carry out. Therefore as the story, I have no •
doubt, concerns yourself and your brothers, you ,
might as well let me have it in detail.”
“I’ll, write it out,” said the giant cautiously, ,
“ and leave it for you to read after we have sailed
for Europe. ”
He did, and here it is—unaltered, save for
names.

The Old West Side.
(** The West Side,” alias Heaven. The country w est
of the Great Lakes.)
[For The Bulletin.]
In the East are glowing cities, running etreams,
and fertile lands;
In the West you chase the sundown over barren,
billowed sands ;
And a month or two of travel may not show a
fence or track ;
In the East, the engine whistles in the busman's
“ way out back.”
There the towns are full of riches, but with hun-
ger in the street;
In the simple West, the poorest gets his damper
and his meat,
And I’d swap the eastern grandeur—all its gleam-
ing wealth and pride—
For another trip with camel* on the Old West
Side.
In the East, the towny bushm.*i sighs for cities in
the scrub,
And “ no horse can ever thro* • him ” —when he’s
safe inside a pub.,
And he talks of outside country where the myall
blacks abound ;
Yet a cocky’s paddock slews hii. —and he cooeys
till he’s found.
But the Western man is grimly short of speech
and slow of skite,
Though he crosses—and with horses —from Mount
Eba to the Bight.
Eighty miles to water —trackless—is esteemed a
trifling ride
By the lusty breed of bushmen on the Old West
Side.
There’s a multitude of crawlers in the hungry,
bitter East;
Every one will eat his fellow and will glory in the
feast.
Of the “dignity of labor,” he will talk and come
again;
But he smooges to the bosses, though he growls
amongst the men.
There is gritty independence in the bushman of
the West,
For he knows his solid value, and he gives his
tongue a rest;
He’s a comrade keen and kindly—he’s a friend
that’s safely tried—
O, there’s whips and whips of mateship on the
Old West Side 1
THE EXCLUSTYENESS
OF THE SAILOR'S LYDY-LOYE.
1.—Civilian accosts her and is repelled with scorn.
2.-Three minutes afterwards.
In their crowded lands the choking Easterns
ever stew and seethe —
Ev’ry twenty miles a station, till a man can
hardly breathe;
And a cocky-crowded seaboard, with its shipping
ever black —
But I love to face the ocean with a desert at my
back !
O, the solemn West and soothing, gives the helot
brain release,
And the races’ ready babble never penetrates its
peace.
O, a spell was flung upon me to endure until I
died —
By the subtle desert breezes of the Old West Side!
Now, the East has cultivation of the shallow,
bookish kind,
But the West sinks mighty furrows in the sub-
soil of the mind ;
And it sometimes gave me glimpses of the greater
things that be,
As I swayed, within its stillness, like a dead man
in the sea.
O, the everlasting silence of the grey and dreamy
West !
O, the thoughts I bred within it of my deepest
and my best !
Eor I snatched at Truth, elusive, and I knew her
as a bride,
When I brooded in the vastness of the Old West
Side.
Should I die in roaring London, ’mid the glare of
rival marts ;
’Mid the chilly city faces and the stony city
hearts ;
Where the strumpet air an >und me has been breath
for thousands more ;
And the hireling eyes that watch me witness
death-beds by the score
Then, I shall not lack companions, haunted by
each ghostly thought
Of the ruddy sin connnittid and the great work
left unwrought:
But, beyond its ruined temple ere my vagrant
soul has hied,
It will flash a moment’s rnem’ry on the Old West
Side !

[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
COLONIAL EXPERIENCE AT ANDAMOOKA.
The unfortunate Jackeroo who left the city six
weeks’ ago—portmanteau to follow.
“Something would have to be done.” Father
said so, but he had made that remark so often
that it had lost its significance. Mother bemoaned
the fact that none of the girls could “get homes
of their own, ”as she put it. Things were as bad
as they could be. Father always had some “life”
nearly fixed up, and was frequently on the point
of “writing new business,” but, somehow, people
will not insure nowadays. “Too many little
doubles, ” Father said.
Mag was a waitress in a tea-room in the city.
The other two girls were too young to go out.
After tea, Father asked why Mag was not home.
Bert said he supposed she had gone to another
“ Gipsy Tea. ” Father growled out some-
thing about “ always gadding about,” and
relapsed into gloomy silence. Mother
sewed on.
About eleven o’clock Mag came home,
and much to our surprise, brought a
young man with her. She introduced
him to us as “Mr. Slayman.”
Father was always on the look-out
for business, and soon had found out
that Slayman was insured. “ Heavily,
in the A.M.P. ; a fellow never knows
when he may be thrown out
of his drag,” Mr. Slayman said.
After our visitor left, Mag packed the younger
ones off to bed, arid then said, “ Well, what do
you think of him ? ”
Father, disgusted with his non-success in the
Insurance line, said “Not much.” Mother,
having seen at a glance how things were, kissed
Mag, and said that he was a fine young fellow,
and that she hoped to goodness Mag had got him.
Mag said, “ Rather ! He’s snared ! ”
Father brightened up a lot now, prospective
loans of a few “ bob” —perhaps even a fiver “till
Monday ” —flew across his mind.
Mother asked Mag what Slayman was. “A
squatter,” Mag replied; “a rich squatter—got a
big station out from Bourke.”
Bert, who had once had six weeks with a wool-
classer, in a New England shed, and consequently
thought himself an authority on the bush,
reckoned that Mag should be able to get him a job
on the station. He always spoke of employment
of any sort as a “job,” much to mother’s, disgust.
She said “ position ” was the correct word.
Before putting out the lamp, father asked Mag
to find out if Slayman had any hay-sheds, huts,
stables, out-houses—anything that wanted in-
suring.
* * * *
Mr. Slayman had to be back at the station in
three weeks, so things were hurried up, and Mag
and he were married a fortnight after
the time they first met at Mosman’s
Bay. Slayman said he would take
Bert up with him.
We all went to Redfern to see them
off. Just before the train left, father
asked Slayman for the loan of ten
shillings. His son-in-law had nothing
less than a five - pound - note, which
he offered, but, much to our sur-
prise, father would not
take it.
* * *
We heard nothing of
them for about ten
days.. Then Bert
wrote: —
Dear Alt.—l’d have writ-
ten sooner only I
couldn’t get a stamp.
What do you think ?
We have all been
taken down. When
we got to Bourke, one
of the station-hands
met us with a spring-cart.
The man looked at S. and
said : “ Well, gorblime, if
you aint a strong joint!
The blokes ’ave dropped to

the time wot you broke
the school, and Jimmy
the Whisperer swears
that he is dead to give yer

for a blanky monkey, and
the boss says that ’e’s a
darned good mind to give
yer the break for stayin’ over
yer time. Who’s the tart yer
'ave with yer, anyhow?” May fainted. I asked S.
what the blazes it all meant. He said, “ Now look here,
sonny, you wanted a job, didn’t you? Well, I'll get the
boss to put you on as cow-boy—five bob a week and
tucker. It’s no use kiddin’ any more, I’m the hut-cook
and Mag’s the new housemaid.’’
I’m staying on till I earn my fare up and down (S. got
the boss to charge me with my fare up). Mag up to-day
for the first time since we’ve come here —she was too ill
to work before.—Yours, Beet.
I showed father and mother the letter. Mother
followed Mag’s example, and fainted. Father
put on his hat, and as he went out the door I
heard him say, Struthl why didn’t I snap that
fiver 1”

Lots in a Name.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
My name is Dent—Cornelius Benjamin Dent.
I’m an unassuming traveller for a well-known
whisky firm, and am known, if not to fame, at
least to a great many famous whisky-shifters as
plain “Con.”
I had often heard of Cowbail from an old school-
mate, Jack Parker, who ran the only pub. in that
village. Among other things, Jack had told me
that although the many big families of little
Paheys, O’Dowds, and M‘Spuds quite warranted
the establishment of a public-school, the parents—
not one of whom knew B from the track of a
milker—fought “ hand and fut ’’ against it. “Luk
ad us,” they’d say. “Luk ad Maloney! Cud he
be anny betther if he’d been to shcool all the life
av him?” Jack couldn’t possibly have lived
among them, only that he’d married “ wan o’ the
Mulcaheys.”
I struck Parker’s shanty one morning just as he
was leaving Cowbail for the day. We had a
drink, however, and Jack was going
off in a hurry when the longest
Irishman I ever want to see
entered the bar.
“Con, old man,” said Parker,
“I : ll leave you in good
company—Mr. Maloney,
Con; Mr. Dent, Mr.
Maloney ; ” and Jack left
us.
“ Have a drink, Mr
Maloney? I’m travelling
in the interests of this
stuff ” pointing to my
glass, still half-full of whisky-
and-milk.
Maloney eyed the glass sus-
piciously. “ I’m obligated to
ye, Misther Dint; but, Minnie”
(to Parker’s little girl) “I’ll thry
a thimbleful av Ould Irish.”
“Try my brand, Mr. Maloney—
White Horse”—
“ The divil a sup av white shtuff—
horse or cow —l’ll tashte. The Ould
Irish, Minnie.”
After vainly trying to draw Maloney
out on the weather, horses, crops and
cattle, 1 concluded that Parker’s re-
mark about the “good company”
must have been meant for a joke.
The only subject that Maloney
seemed to be even faintly in-
terested in, was “Cows and the
Milkin’ Industhery.” He ap-
peared to be thinking hard.
He’d squint at me over the
tail - board of his eye, pucker
up his lips, wipe the bridge of his nose with
knitted eye-brows, and finally, slapping his thigh
as though he had thought the thing out, he left
me without a word.
Half-an-hour later, while stretched on the
parlor sofa, I heard Maloney’s voice in the bar—
the words rolling out like potatoes from a sack.
Wondering what could have interested him, I
listened. “I tell ye, Monaghan, the milkin’ indus-
thery is at shtake. It’s as plain as the nose on
Nolan’s face there. I’m thravellin’ in the in*
therests av milk,’ sez he. ‘ln your own dirty
intherests,’ sez I. ‘ls your cows goin’ dhry?’
sez he. ‘ Dhry as chalk,' sez I. Phat is id that
brings the dirty Turk here, but that same ‘goin’
dhry,’ an’ the convanienoy av the chalk-pits ? An’
are oo goin’ to sit down an’ let him take the bread
out av our mouths, wid his blashted tins o’ ohalk-
mflk wid the hussy av a milkmaid on them ? Are
we goin’, I say, to let this dirty Swish blaggard
depriviate us of our industhery ? ”
“ Hear Maloney ! Hear Maloney ! ” in three or
four different keys of brogue.
“ But, Maloney, who is the shpalpane?”
“ Aren’t I tellin’ 00, Mulcahey, that it’s Con
Dint, no less ? An’ isn’t his milk ruinatin’ our in-
dusthery all over the worreld ? ‘ Con Dint’s
Milk.’ it sez on the tin—‘none genuine ’ceptin’
the Milkmaid brand.’ But neow, me boys, we’ll
drink his belt in Ould Irish—an’ then t’ give
him the father av a batin.”
I’m a modest man—l left. I have since thought
it advisable to drop my first handle, and be satis-
fied with the second. Bor the future I wish to be
known as Ben Dent. It’s safer. The country’s
full of Cowbails.

PIPES O' THREE
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
Oh, well I remember the
Pipes o’ Three,
Pipes o’ Three;
Blasphemous, devilling Pipes o’ Three.
Sweet nights soft-clouded of burning weed,
When we brimmed-up the goblets with steaming
rum,
And read the lust of a Scotchman’s screed
Who is sooping his parritch in Kingdom Come.
Nights when three glasses sang to three men
In the clink of their meeting. When fleshly joke
From lips wet with liquor gave an Amen,
And the voice of the banjo laughed thro’ the
smoke:
God save ye, Pipes o’ Three !
O God, in His goodness, save ye,
Save ye !
Oh, well I remember the
Pipes o’ Two,
Pipes o’ Two;
Sorrowful, thoughtful Pipes o’ Two.
Pictures and candles, an empty chair,
A paper of dottle, a half-written verse,
A stolen ribbon from Maisie’s hair,
A bangle, a garter, a book, and a purse ;
And twain with wet eyes, and glass to lip,
Ere drinking their measure most rev’rently
spoke:
“To the pipe that is broke —here’s a nip !”
Then the voice of the banjo sobbed through the
smoke:
O, Pipes o’ Two, I pity you;
God can’t save three,
So who’ll save two ?
Oh, cheer me, oh, cheer me, oh,
Pipe o’ One,
Pipe o’ One!
Solitary, peaceful Pipe o’ One.
Lone in the shadowy picture-room
I sit with my banjo asleep on my knee ;
A pipe-star floats on the edge of gloom
And I fancy I’m seeing the stars of three.
It’s only the fume of steaming rum
That is swirling my brain. And I soak and soak,
And beatings of hammers in both ears hum,
And the voice of the banjo fights thro’ the
smoke:
Oh, Pipe o’ One,
You’re done !
You’re done ; you’re done —
Done ! Done !

Ice Virgins.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
Pale virgins of the Arctic,
They pulse across the tides
To meet the lords Antarctic,
Who fain would make them brides.
The wicked White Fox spied them
Beyond the Frozen Sea,
With but dim Night to hide them,
Still sleeping nakedly.
A woman-seal, bewailing
Her dead cub in the floe,
Saw one tall wanton sailing
Out South’ard through the snow.
Down by the Crozets lying—
Storm-stricken on the waste —
In weedy seas slow dying
Her twin berg bids her haste.
A man-seal strangely bleeding
Beneath the midnight sun
Beheld him proudly speeding
Towards far Septentrion.
Long, long he fared and sought her
From realms of Night and Fire,
The gray North’s gracious daughter—
His lily of desire.
The clumsy cow-whale, giving
A great dug to her calf,
Breaks surges unforgiving
That built his cenotaph.
The petrel heard him groaning,
The penguin saw him die,
The dovekies mock her moaning,
The daft auks watch her by.
Now, in their bride-robes biding,
Throng down her sisters tall,
Whose lords-elect are chiding,
Whose waiting bridegrooms call;
In vain their mad dams stayed them —•
The painted glaciers these,
Who on their cold breasts laid them
Through aching centuries.
Once came the Vikings sweeping—
Red fell the clean snows then—
Once came the long ships leaping
Of swart Basque sailor-men ;
Once came John Cabot, sailing
Nor’-West for rich Cathay ;
Once Baffin’s tub turned, trailing
A-leak to Melville Bay.
Came Ghosts—of Hudson steering,
To skirt the Middle Ice ;
Came Shades—of Franklin, Behring,
First Sons of Sacrifice.
What heed these white maids, burning,
Who sweep by Cape Farewell?
What heeds the Earth-maid, yearning,
Doomstruck ? —Love legends tell.
The ice-blink fadeth faster
From strange green water-skies;
Each berg her lot has cast her
Where now her love-lot lies.
Fierce Southern Seas enfold them,
Torn from their glacial shore,
And strong-armed breakers hold them
A-dreaming evermore.
Yon wings the fond she-eider,
Yon creeps the lone white hare,
And with her cubs beside her
Slow hunts the Polar bear.
Bejewelled charms revealing,
Pink harlots they at noon,
But sinless ladies stealing
Soft homeward in the moon.
So comes the King-berg Nor’ward
To seek his love again ;
So goes the Queen-berg forward,
Amort and all in vain.
She at the Grand Bank dieth,
Who thus the Sun-god dares;
Me, worn and wasted, lieth
A -dying at the Snares.
He may not kiss his rover,
The warm blue seas between ;
She may not clasp her lover,
Nor be his Boreal Queen.
They greet not, meet not ever ;
They touch not mouth to mouth,
Who still go North forever,
Forever who go South.

It was in the height of the drought. Tom,
Andy and the old woman sat discussing the
various features of the dry spell, when the boss
came in and said, “ Banner’s down.” Andy rose
and shook himself in anticipation of some hard
work. And we all filed out to the stable, preceded
by the old woman with a light. There lay Ban-
ner, a huge, blotchy, flea-bitten grey, with sad
eye’s and a drooping under-lip. He was down
right enough. Andy and Tom each seized an ear
and with a mighty effort lifted Banner’s head on
to Andy’s shoulder. Meanwhile the boss and the
old" woman had shoved a sapling under Banner
and raised his hindquarters, when Andy shouted,
“ Look out; Banner’s going ! ’’and rushed. Ban-
ner fell, a confused mass, head underneath him,
and legs everywhere. Then the boss twitched a
wire on to Banner’s tail, swung it over a beam
and all hands hung on to it except Madame, who
took off her boot and pounded Banner’s backbone
with the heel of it by way of refreshment. Banner
had a look at himself and groaned, Having
secured the wire they grabbed various parts of
the forequarters, and. with a “ Yer ho! ” from the
boss, lifted Banner, very groggy, but able to stanc.
with the help of a prop placed under each side.

GROWING EXTRAVAGANT.
“ We'll get a good ’un next time if we ’ave ter pay thirty bob fer it! ”
There were three of us—survey hands and we
sat smoking in our tent, and watching the bright
November day draw near its end. Our door
faced Westward toward the sea,, which, beyond
the low sand ramparts, lay weltering in broken,
glancing lights. To the sou’-west a sudden rocky
bluff bit largely into the long-drawn sky-line, and
close under its lee a needle upon the sand dunes
cut sharply into the purity beyond, marking the
grave of a long-dead stockman. A mouldering
board still set forth in faint letters that the
underneath had been named M‘Guire.
And it was here, in the light of the sunset,
when all was still except the wind in the trees,
and the moan of the sea, and the skurry of the
kangaroo dog’s four dishonest feet as he fled with
a piece of beef, and the voice of the fatted cook
cursing helplessly in the rear, that Phil drifted
into a story.
Cockney had just remarked with a shudder that
these sand-hills were a lonely place for any “ pore
cove ”to be buried. Cockney was a sociable gin-
and-pipe man and loathed solitude.
“It’s splendid isolation, Cockney,” replied
Phil. “ You wouldn’t have a right bushman,
such as Paddy was, laid in fellowship with smug
shopkeepers, and dear departed sisters, in a
crowded city cemetery. I used to know him. I
was over this side years ago, you know. Shuter
had the run in those days.
“ Shuter wasn’t a bad chap, as I remember him.
He was merely a young ass, that thought himself
wise ; he had yet to learn that working knowledge
must be counter-signed by experience. Shuter
pointed this moral by marrying a certain barmaid ;
DIFFERENT SYMPTOMS.
MR. MONTAGUE HAMMER: “ Don’t you find
that our new leading lady gets on your
nerves? ”
MR. FOOTTITE : "Not at all. In fact, she
generally gets on my knees! ”
if he had been as wise as he thought he was, he
would have married a wiser barmaid.
“ Well, he brought home his gaudy, cigarette-
box bride, and proceeded to be unreasonably
happy. He little thought that Mrs. Shuter and
handsome Paddy M'Guire, the stockman, were
old acquaintances —not that he would have cared,
for Shuter was an ass, as I have already said.
“ It wasn’t long, in the narrow atmosphere of
station-life, before the delighted hands began ex-
changing nods and winks, together with much sin-
ful speculation concerning the coming eruption.
“I think Paddy was even happier than Shuter
—certainly, he ought to have been —while Mrs.
Shuter was happier than either of them ; the lady
being as great an ass as her husband, with the
added advantage of being charmingly vicious.
“The end of the comedy came unexpectedly,
after all. Paddy was camped over at this hut,
and when Shuter, coming ashore from an unex-
peeted ketch, after a roving mission for
stock, threw open the door, the first thing
his glance fell upon was the flushed face
and frank deshabille of his pretty
wife.
“ Paddy M‘Guire, who was loung-
ing on his stretcher, with a bottle
at his elbow, jumped up with an
oath.
“The woman turned white, and,
putting her hands to her face, began
a frightened whimpering. Shuter stood
a moment, a picture of unbounded
astonishment. Then he sat down upon
a stool and laughed—a frightful laugh.
“‘Shut up, you!’ said Paddy,
turning savagely upon the frightened
woman.
“‘Soothe her, M'Guire, soothe her,’ said
Slmter, still laughing, his soul in hell.
“Mrs. Shuter, her craven heart dying
within her, rushed forward and threw her-
self at her husband’s feet, endeavouring to
kiss his hands.
“ ‘ Oh, forgive me ! ’ she sobbed. ‘lt
was not my fault,’ and she poured forth
her justification in an incoherent babble.
“Shuterlistened patiently until she had finished,
and was crouching over his hand, mumbling it
with her soft red lips. Then he began, quietly.
“ ‘ A man usually makes one grave mistake in
his life. I have had my opportunity early and
have taken it; my folly has been so great that it
is almost a crime. When I have made atonement
all that has occurred shall be forgotten, and the
written pages of my life turned down.’ He
spoke so calmly that the fool brightened, and
began protesting afresh. Paddy’s hand stole
about the neck of the bottle. ‘Pity
you; forgive you. Why, ay, you shall be for-
given. Never again ; so help you God ! Good !
A righteous mood ! ’ he repeated, as if self-com-
muning ;‘ a righteous mood ! ’ Then he sprang
furiously to his feet.
“‘A righteous deed, by God ! ’ he shrieked,
with reversed hunting crop swung back, above the
fair, upturned face.
“ But Paddy was a man prompt in emergency ;
before the blow fell the heavy champagne-bottle
struck Shuter under the brim of his hat and felled
him. He rolled half over and lay like a dead
man.
“When he came to himself he was in his own bed
with a shaven, bandaged head. A little later he
learned that his wife had disappeared ; also that
he was minus the services of his best stock-rider.
Paddy M‘Guire was dead. He had got drunk
with a hawker who visited his hut, and had gone
to sleep in the open, frosty night. When he
awoke in the morning every breath he drew
seared bis tortured lungs. Three days
later he occupied the grave down
yonder.”
Phil stopped.
“ O'v did Shuter git on?” said
Cockney, greatly interested in the
story.
“Shuter! Oh, resorted to riotous
living after the good old formula, and
went stone, motherless broke. Then
he plunged around with the bridle
off until he got tangled up in a sort
of Gordian knot, which he cut ex-
peditiously, changing his name aftei
the feat. Took turns at droving,
mining, horse-breaking, and such like
diversions, drinking industriously the
while, until the inevitable fever
arrived ; lay in hospital with plenty of
time for reflection, and left it a
philosopher—Hello ! here’s the cook
foul of the guys.”
A violent agitation of the tent,
with many flowers of diction from the
invisible cook.
“ I say, cook, I wish you’d tie up
that damned dog ; he’ll be at those
skins again.”
The cook came in cursing us for
sitting in the dark “ like a lot o’
mopokes. ”
I lit the candle, and we all turned
in ; the light was doused, and soon
the camp lay silent and lonely in
the black night. Drifting into a
fathomless slumber I was re-called to
life with a start. Cockney, the irre-
pressible, was speaking.
“Isy, Phil.”
“ Hollo ! ” In a cross, sleepy voice.
“ Did Shuter ever come acrost ’is
missis agin ? ”
“What? Yes. Shut up and go to
sleep.”
“ Did ’e spread ’er aout ? I would.”
“ Ay, but you’ve no sense of propor-
tion. I remember the day you dealt
it out to big Grainger, after the best
traditions of ‘The Noo Cut,’ you
fiery atom. When Shuter met her he gave her a
sovereign ; she wanted it even worse than he did,
poor devil! ”
“ Gam ! But ’e must a’ felt narked ? ”
“Didn’t I tell you that he had learned philo-
sophy ? ”
“O, that—be—bio wed ! Ther’s on’y one man as
can sy for certain wot ’is feelin’s wos, an’ that’s

“ Just so ! And I’m Shuter ! ”

A Break in the Clouds.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
An old, bent, hairy, shrunken man; the long bony
fingers of one hand twining themselves round a
stick on which he leaned heavily ; his other hand
resting on his arched back; sighing and moaning ;
full of complaints, full of laments: a querulous,
churlish old man. “Old Dad” Tremayne. The
fine weather, he whined, brought to him only a
crucifixion of “rheumatics ” ; the damp, a torment
of asthma. And nobody wanted him. He had
sons ; yes, and daughters. But they didn’t want
him. Nobody wanted him. And nobody, he
believed, would even be just enough to him to
remember that he was more in his own way than
in anybody else’s. Poor “ Old Dad ” Tremayne.
So, firmly believing that nobody wanted him, he
had growled himself into refuge in an old-people’s
home.
Six months afterwards, when I saw him again,
“Old Dad’s ” back was straighter. His left hand
had come from off his spine, and the lamentations
from off his lips.
“My boy,” he cackled cheerfully, “ha, ha!
I’m doing splendidly. Splendidly ! You know
James, my son James —he’s a changed man, he is.
Why, bless me, I’m beginning to think I didn’t
know my own boy. The old dad—ha, ha ! —why,
he can’t do without the old dad. Splendid,
splendid ! —think of it, James wanted me all the
time. You never saw anybody so delighted as
James and Alice —that’s James’s wife—were to see
me. Happy ? Ha, ha, ha ! Why, they caYt do
without me. I keep the books.”
And as he made the last announcement the old
man’s back was almost straightened. But he
winced a little, and his hand crept back to the
tortured spine as in the old unhappy days; yet in
a moment he was chuckling again.
Then Tremayne, who was “shipmates” with
my father, told me how James kept a store ; and
he volunteered much information as to James’s
customers and the extent of their dealings. But
James’s virtues were the main theme; and not by
any means the least of
them was his discovery
and admission of the
old man’s indispensable-
ness.

EUROPEAN WIFE OF CHINESE PUBLICAN (who ha.

daughters? Who’d marry them slant-eyed
thines?”
BYSITTER : “ Take no notice of him, missus.
There’s men in this back country that’d marry
anything!”
“Now,” he said, suddenly, “I must get away.
There’s my ledger not half posted yet. Why,
bless me ” (and he thought of it with a start), “ I
haven’t copied-off into the day-book yet either.
So you won’t keep me gossiping now, will you—
you see the position I’m in ? ”
And the bow went out of his back once more.
» • • *
It was only a few weeks afterwards that we
met again. He came to me in the early morning.
“ You’re honest, I think,” he said with startling
suddenness; “you showed sympathy with me
once when I needed it. You must help me now,
for I’m in deeper trouble than ever I was before.”
Something had evidently excited him thor-
oughly, yet he had himself in control, by how
great an effort I could only guess. For myself, I
could not find a word that seemed suitable. So
he ran on :
“My son is—my God, but it is true !—my son
is a rogue ! ”
James ?—ana he was the hero of the old
man’s story when last we met.
“A rogue, yes. A swindler, a cheat, a thief !
And—Oh, my God, to think of it!—l have got
people to trust him.”
This was serious. Of course, I could only say
that he must have made a hideous mistake ; why,
all the town, I said, spoke of Tremayne’s honesty.
“ Ay, the town. What does the town know —
yet ? Listen. On Monday night my asthma was
so much better that I walked down to the shop
after tea. There was no light on my own desk, so
I went to James’s office. And there—my God,
it’s true! —there I found another set of books.
Another set of books, I say. A day-book was
open in front of me. I rushed for my own. Item
after item was in his that was not in mine. And
it was from his book, with these false entries, that
the monthly accounts were being made. Then I
knew why he insisted that I shouldn’t be troubled
with the bills. ‘That’s just a clerk’s work,’ he
would say, ‘ not an accountant’s ; I’m fit for
things like that.’ And he my son ! ”
“It’s a bit queer,” I said. “But look here.
Have you asked your son to explain it ? ”
“ Explain it ? I challenged him on Tuesday.
He shuffled. He shuffled. He shuffled, I say.
My son shuffled. No ;he lied. Told me it was
all right. All right ? False entries all right ?
Lying, swindling books all right ? And he
brazens it out. I set myself to watch him on
Tuesday night ; and he copied from that black,
infernal book again. . . . This is my happiness.
I am brought here to throw people off the scent of
a rogue—and him my son. ‘ Indispensable ;
Can’t do without the old dad.’ Don’t you
see what he meant ? He couldn’t swindle
without me—that’s it. Oh, my God ! ”
As the flood increased the old man’s calm was
broken down and swept away.
I confess I am not used to such awkward situa-
tions. James’s peccadilloes certainly were not in
my mind; I was just thinking that an old man
like this couldn’t stand much of that excitement.
“You say nothing!” he exclaimed. “You—
you don’t think this honest ? The world is different
now, I know, but surely not so different. lam
an old man, and my head swims ; I lose my
thoughts ” (and he rapped his forehead viciously).
“ That is why I came to you. But just give me
shelter while I can think —give me no more help.
That is all. I know my duty. A thief —my God,
my God ! ”
The old man shook his head as if to throw the
torturing thought out of it, and covered his face
with his hands.
* * * *
I went into town at once, and to Tre-
mayne’s store. Tremayne was out;
no one knew
where he had
gone. On
the assur-
ance that
he would
be in short-
ly, I wait-
ed a weary
hour.
Then h e
came.
“ M y
father;
have you
seen him?
Ah, that’s
good.
Well, he’s
led me a
dance. Ex-
cuse me
for one mo-
ment. Evans, ”
—this to an as-
sistant —“ step down
to the station, and tell
the officer that the old
gentleman enquired-for has
been found. You see ” (this to
me again) “ how anxious we’ve
been. ”
We soon were in the midst of the story.
“ It’s a deuce of a mess—the very deuce. Look
nere. You know the old gentleman. You know
his fixed idea that nobody wanted him. Well, we
couldn’t stand him being in the asylum—we
always call it that—so we got him here. He was
moping about, with nothing to do, miserable him-
self and making everybody else miserable, and
really it was a rest when he left for the asylum
>nce more. But then the missus got the idea of
giving him some books to keep—and, why I
thought he was as happy as a sandboy ! ”
“Yes, but—you’ll pardon me—about the two
sets of books ? ”
“Oh ! My dear fellow, haven’t you dropped
to it? Why, surely you know what the old
man’s memory is like? You really can’t suppose
he could be trusted with the books ? We had to
find something for him to do, and we found some-
thing. It cost a sovereign or so for stationery,
and the little trouble (which didn’t count) of
giving him something to enter. That’s all. So,
of course, if there was a rush on—well, he wasn’t
troubled with all the slips. Now, d’ye see ? But,
I say, it’s rather awkward to explain to him, isn’t
it?”
It was. James clearly didn’t like the job.
Besides, it occurred to me that it would be easier
for someone else to make the explanation—some-
one who could insist upon the filial' virtues
which underlaid the whole scheme. So I under-
took it.
And I really thought I was going excellently,
too. He did not speak a word until I ended
triumphantly—“ Now you understand it all, don’t
you ? And I congratulate you on having such a
son.”
“Thank you, thank you,” he said, very gently,
and very slowly, “I understand. Yes, I have
wronged James again—wronged him again. ”
“Then let us go to him. They are anxious for
you. lam not busy ; we will go together. ”
“No; wait a little,” he answered. “I am
tired. My head still swims. Let me rest a little ;
this excitement is not good for an old man, a very
old man.”
The white-bearded chin sank upon his chest.
The back was bent again. The tears that came

were not brushed away. There was a lump in my
throat that warned me not to speak.
He helped himself to his feet with his stick as
he used to do.
“ Good-bye,” he said; “ I will go alone. Good-

What a mistake—what a mistake ! Why, I was

“I dislike working in the wind.”
I reined-up. The man stood on the road bank,
looking down on me with friendly benevolence.
He was tall, soldier-like, fair-whiskered and mou-
stached, with clean-shaven chin; flannel shirt,
embroidered smoking - cap, moleskin pants,
patent-leather shoes; he rested his hand on a
spade lightly as on a walking-cane.
“What do you think of that, for a new
chum ? ” he enquired airily, as though we
were old. friends, and pointing to a
partly-erected fence. There might have
been four rods of the zig-zag work,
the posts leaning at all angles like
drunken men; the rails up and
down like steps, the skin of sap
still on them, with no pretence
of shouldering at the joints.
I replied, warily—“ That
never before had I seen such
a fence.” This seemed to
please him mightily.
“Now, that shows what
a man can do if he is put
to it. You may be sure
1 did not learn fencing at
Rugby or Oxford. But
there! My tutor said many
a time: A man with a

to offer you a seat ? ” He
took a silk handkerchief
from his fob, and care-
fully dusted a stump.
“ This wind is deuced un-
pleasant, don’t you know;
makes work an effort. I dis-
like effort; so unpleasant,
you know ; yet I have not
done so badly this morn-
ing; two panels ; it’s pretty
tough, but better than
sheep-farming. Did you
ever keep sheep ? ”
I shook my head.
“ Then you ought. Now
let me advise you. No
man knows life, or rather
death, who has hot kept
sheep. Tried it for two
years—l was single then—
no company but sheep
and my own thoughts.
Terrible place, that bush, for thinking.
Most men, I fancy, have second thoughts, job
lines; but back there,” and the speaker waved
his hand towards the West, “a man makes his own
ideas as he makes his own damper; and the out-
look differs from that on the park hack in Rotten
Row. You ” He was checked by the sound
of the banging of a tin-can in a tent close at hand.
“ Allow me to offer you some slight refresh-
ment. Positively, I will accept no denial. You
must see my wife —a remarkable woman—a woman
in a million. Native grace, natural freedom,
beauty unadorned ! —you understand. We are a
little cramped for room. ‘ Love in a tent.’ Quite
primitive, classical, and all that sort o’ thing.”
“ Hurry up, Jim ; the taters is getting cold ! ”
a strident voice called from the calico.
We hurried.
“My wife, Mrs. Ponsonby. Mr. pardon, I
did not catch the name. Yes, certainly—Mr.
Dickson. ”
A woman, with the form of a girdled sack be-
neath a face of red dough, stood at the tent-open-
ing, and shook my hand laboriously;.
“That’s she ! ” the husband whispered to me,
impressively. “ Isn’t she splendid ? Racy of the
soil. Sound as a bell. Fourteen stone. Gives
the sense of repose.: Latent force ; infinite power,
and all that sort of thing. A true artist, too, in a
modest way. I always upheld the grill till I
married ; but her frying is superb—a poem—it
converted me. You see the pan is the source of
all gravy. Now, what is life without gravy?”
He put the proposition seriously, without a
smile, as self-evident, calling for no reply.
“You must just take
pot-luck, Mister,” said
Mrs. Ponsonby as she
handed me a plate of
corned-beef; “helpyerself
ter taters. When the billy
biles we’ll have some tea.”
Ponsonby listened to his
wife approvingly, look-
ing to me for responsive
thrill. I noticed that,
before eating, he went
through the mechanical
process of unfolding an
invisible serviette and
spreading it on his knees.
“Do you like it sweet
or dry ? ” lie enquired, as
he carefully til ted the hi ily
of black tea, pouring it
gently, as though not to
disturb a possible sedi-
ment. “Pardon me.
Your horse ? I had
nearly forgotten. ”
I assured him the mare
would do well- enough;
that a fence-post to gaze
on for five or six hours
was the normal refresh-
ment of a bush brumby;
but he would not have it
so, declaring, with hos-
pitable persistence, that
after a ten miles ride a
horse should be baited,
and hurried out to find
some corn.
“Now, tell me straight, what do yer think of
him. Mister Dickson?” enquired Mrs. Ponsonby.
“Ain’t he enough ter make er woman dotty?
English he calls hisself, but Lord knows where
they make ’em ! ” She did not pause. for answer.
“ There ain’t much style about this place, a bit
rough ; you should see Dad’s house; there’s stairs.
My word ! and the room on top. You must come
and see us when Jim gets the slabs and we put up
something comfortable ; but, alas ! Jim’s no help
ter a woman, can’t graft somehow; not like my
cousin Jack—there’s a man for yer—shear his 150,
or split his five-score rails a day. If Jack had
only said the word you’d not have found me in
this camp. My colonial ! ”
Before I left, I had to admire the fence again,
as Ponsonby walked about it lovingly, shaking the
posts to show that they were not so very loose
Months later I met him in the city, this time
faultlessly dressed, but his manner knew no
change.
“How are you, dear boy? A wine with me?
Positively, I will take no refusal. ” I asked how
life had fared with him. We were in the bar of
the Australia, and it was with a choke in his voice
that he answered, as he filled my glass—
“ A great ]oss ! You will
feel for me,” (Here
he paused to wipe
his moustache with
a silk handker-
chief.) “My

fore my luck turned, too.” He looked over the
rim of his glass silently for a while. Presently,
he brightened up. “ By-the-way, lamin a bank
now, you know—9 till 4—three hundred a-year,
and all that sorb o’ thing.”
I asked him when she died.
“ Not that, thank God! She lives, but there was
a cousin Jack —perhaps you heard her speak of
him —old flame, twin souls, hearts that beat as
one, and all that sort o’ thing. She left me.” He
sighed reminiscently as he emptied his glass with
slow deliberation; but, looking up, his eyes
brightened and the shadow passed.

“How cam there be any sin in looking at and
admiring God's creatures on the first day of
the week? "—Daily paper.
The Wai-tohunga-utu (literally, “ the Waters of
the Necromancer’s Vengeance) is a quiet, well-
behaved little river as you see it whimpling over
its grey boulders through the pleasant level coun-
try near the town of Whakarongatai— just as
though it is conscious that its journey to the sea is
about ended, and that a sober demeanor is
demanded by the solemnity of the occasion.
But away up in the ranges behind the town, one
would not go to its banks for pastoral inspiration;
though here the tragic muse might not be wooed in
vain. Every hill-top shows the remains of some
ancient Maori fortification, and has its accompany-
ing tradition of gallant defence or deed of ruth.
Every c ascade is peopled from the Maori Olympus
and every pool is the home of a taniwha, of prow-
ess that quite overshadows the mediaeval dragon so
fortuitously slain by the patron saint of England.
It is at Devil’s Elbow that Wai-tohunga-utu is
in the plenitude of majestic terror. Here the
valley, bastioned with precipices, widens some-
what, and the river swirls round a cliffy promon-
tory of milk-white quartz. A road practicable to
sledges or pack-horses winds painfully round the
bend of the torrential stream. This is a detour of
nearly two miles, though on foot, if one[s nerves
be good, it is possible to crawl along a giddy tree
bridge high over the foaming, tumbling water and
so pass from the “ wrist ” to the “shoulder ” of the
“ Devil’s Elbow ’’ in a few seconds. By doing
this, the long journey round the “Elbow” is of
course avoided, and the distance between the
township and the mines at the head of the Wai-
tohunga-utu is lessened to foot-passengers by
nearly an hour.
This awesome crossing-place is known to the
miners and gum-diggers as MTntyre’s Leap. Poor
Mac ! —a sickly, wizened Scot—is strongly sil-
houetted against the background of my goldfield
recollections. He was a pioneer on every gold-
rush in Australasia —Ballarat, Bendigo, Otago,
West Coast, Thames, the Palmer—and he died of
thirst at the White Feather a year or two back
while still hot-foot on the trail of the golden calf.
• » * *
One morning in the seventies, though it was
raining as it only knows how to rain amid the
heavily-timbered gullies of Whakarongatai,
MTntyre and five other drenched and mud-be-
spattered individuals had assembled round the
entrance to the No. 9 level of the Hibernia mine,
nigh to the Devil’s Elbow. Most of them were
shareholders, and they were all awaiting with in-
terest the news from the face of the drive. For,
the night before, the news had reached the town-
ship that the Hibernia reef had suddenly and un-
expectedly developed extraordinary richness—and
in the words of the manager’s bulletin, showed
“ specimen-stone from wall to wall.” And to this
was due the gathering of moist speculators at the
mouth of the drive on this wet May morning.
Presently the heavy boom of the explosion was
aiid in a few minutes was known to the
waiting group what the blast had disclosed. The
reef it appeared, had been intercepted by a slide,
and’in all probability the quartz beyond the
annoying seam of clay would be worthless. In 99
cases out of 100 on the Whakarongatai goldfield
this had proved to be the effect of slide
intrusion. There was thus, in the judg-
ment of the shareholders, nothing more
to wait for; it was every man’s imme-
diate aim to get back to town and
unload his shares before the inevitable slump.
The first to reach town might, with luck,
succeed in selling without awakening sus-
picion that all was not well at the mine;
as for the slower pedestrians—well, it would
be a case of the devil take the hindmost.
Down came the whole pack of disgruntled
shareholders at a run to the narrow crossing of
the Elbow. Even so early in the six-mile
race that was to be run, the first to get over
the tree-bridge would have an advantage—a
slight one—but still worth striving after.
When they reached the crossing - place
they looked blankly one at the other, for
the bridge had been swept away since their
crossing earlier in the day. Thirty feet of
roaring water separated them from the
short-cut to the township, unreachable now
except by the circuitous road round the
Elbow. With one accord, but without spoken
word to indicate their intentions, the men
tackled the roundabout sledge-road—all
but MTntyre; him they left panting asthma-
tically at the foot of a giant puriri tree which
overhung the torrent. When the runners had
travelled perhaps 300 yards in their headlong
race, “ Bully ” Byrne glanced back at MTn-
tyre and saw something that made him shout
aloud and brought all his comrades to a
standstill. Then they took in the situation.
There was MTntyre holding in his hands a
rata vine, dependent from the lofty puriri.
This parasitio creeper often grows to the
thickness of a man’s leg and is strong enough
to tow an ocean liner. The rata at Devil’s
Elbow, however, was comparatively small—
perhaps an inch in diameter. As Bully
Byrne’s shout echoed through the gully
MTntyre ran down the siding and swung
himself into mid-air. His first attempt to
cross the river failed by a hair’s-breadth, but
it was so apparent to the onlookers that a
passage by this means was quite practicable
that with one impulse they raced back to
the puriri tree. As they ran along MTntyre
again “took off” for his 30-feet “giant’s
stride,” and this time he easily accomplished
the feat, and stood smiling on the bank
with the end of the rata rope in his fingers.
“ Hurry up and sling it back. We don’t
want to stand here all day,” yelled Bully
Byrne, commandingly, and holding out his
hand for the vine,
MTntyre, however, had no such amiable
intention. He tore a strip from his shirt and
proceeded to tie the rata to a punga stump
with the evident intention of preventing it
from swinging back to the upper side of the
chasm.
Five sets of teeth clenched hard, but it
was clearly an occasion for the suaviter in
modo, and the baffled men, with ill-simulated
ease of mind, sought to make terms with
MTntyre.
“You were askin’ me what I’d take for
that greyhound pup, Mac.? ” said Pat Doran,
insinuatingly. “Take it for nothing; my
boy. And if you’ll come along wid me now,
you can take it along wid you, brass collar
and all.”
Mao. smiled grimly at Doran’s seductive
blarney, but vouchsafed no answer. Many
other blandishments were tried, but all proved
futile.
Then Bully Byrne elbowed his way to
the front and called out, briskly, “Come
on, Mac.; no more fooling ; send the rata
back. You ought to know it is a breach
of the law, to say nothing of the minin’
regulations of this here goldfield, for you
to be a-blockin’ up the Queen’s highway.
If any on us liked to be nasty, and squeak
to the warden, you’d be in for a sixer at Mt. Eden,
sure. Boys,” said Byrne, turning to his fellow
unfortunates, “shall we all, here and now, agree
not to divulge the heinyous croime of which
MTntyre has been guilty, vizely blocking us from
taking a lawful walk, provided he at once, and
without further delay, puts us in possession of the
necessary manes of transit, which he is trayson-
ably, feloniously and of malish aforethought
widholding from us? ’’
Byrne’s companions assented to his proposal
with the greatest eagerness.
MTntyre laughed a dry, sarcastic, little laugh
and called out, “ Na, lads ; na. Aw cudna find
it in ma hairt tae let ony o’ ye risk your lives on
that wee bit ropie. Just tak’ a nice, quiet bit o’
walk roon’ th’ road an’ I’ll gang aff doon toon
whaur Aw have some must important business
tae transact not awthe-
gither unconnekit wi’
the sellin’ o’ sorup.”
Then he waved his hand
and moved briskly town-
wards.
Some of Mac. ’s hearers
laughed, despite their
chagrin; Micky Nolan
formulated his celebrated
aphorism which has now
beco me classic that
“ All’s fair in love, war,
and mi n i n’.” Bully
Byrne, who held a
thumping parcel of shares
at a pretty high figure
and who would be
heavily hit by a fall
in price, was unconsol -
able. He shook his
fist after the rapidly-
diminishing form, of
MTntyre, and said in a
tone of concentrated rage
and hatred, “ The Scotch
devil! ”
* * *
MTntyre’s ingenuity,
however, didn’t benefit
him as much as he had
expected, and his excus-
able selfishness proved to
those he left disconsolate
at Devil’s Elbow a bless-
ing in disguise. For,
contrary to all prece-
dent, the reef did carry
gold through the slide,
and those who had to
keep their shares because
they were unsaleable by
the time they reached
town, were next day re-
joicing at the misfortunes
of yesterday, for the
scrip had doubled ir
value.
At any rate, that’s
the true story of how
this part of the Wai-
tohunga-utu came to be
called MTntyre’s Leap.

Miss “Grease.”
A STAGE REMINISCENCE.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
I WAS late for rehearsal, and was surprised, there-
fore, to see most of the company in the passage
as I entered by the stage-door.
“Here he is ! ” cried someone, as I approached
the group. “ Mr. Williamson, this lady wants to
go on the stage. Allow me to introduce Mr.
Williamson—Miss Reece.”
I looked at the lady and bowed with the dig-
nity I thought meet for one representing, if only
for a moment, so great a personage. She was
worthy of contemplation, and I
paused before I spoke.
Nearer fifty, I should think, than
forty-five, but the air of juvenility
on the smiling countenance suggested
a youthful mind. About middle
height, stout, with pale hair, from
which the peroxide brilliance had
long since vanished. Neatly dressed
in a grey coat and skirt, with a silk
waistcoat of sorts, and a black hat
trimmed with vellow feathers.
“Good morning, madame,” I said,
at length. “ Always delighted to
meet a talented amateur —I like the
young enthusiast —yes ! What, may
I ask, is your particular line ? ”
‘ ‘ Go in for a specialty, Miss Reece, ”
whispered one of the boys, in an
audible aside to her. “You get better
pay, and Mr. Williamson wants them
just now.”
“ I didn’t know this was Mr.
Williamson’s theatre,” remarked the
lady, with a wondrously shrewd wink
round. “ You don’t kid me ! ”
I gazed blandly at her, while Miss
Gertie explained.
“It isn’t really,” she said, “ but, of
course, Mr. Williamson’s always on
the look-out for new talent. He s
eternally around the theatres. ”
“Of course I am,” I acquiesced.
“Now, my dear, your special line ?”
“Iplay on the comb,” she answered
with a smirk.
I was taken aback, but I tried not
to show it.
“You could do a turn between
the acts, ” I said meditatively. “ Yes,
it ought to take. About what’s your
salary ? ” .
“I’d come for ten pounds a week,
board and lodging paid, and cabs to
and from the theatre.”
“ Very moderate, indeed 1 And you won’t
object in the meantime to give us a specimen of
your art. Somebody please fetch a comb and
paper. I couldn’t, of course, engage you without
judging of your ability first.”
“ I’m ready ! ” she said promptly.
“Here’s a comb,” said Mason, rushing up.
“ Now, Miss Grease, fire away.”
She played an Irish jig on that old comb till the
passage was filled with dancing maniacs, and the
comedy-man was doing a turn on his own on top
of an empty barrel.
“Stop 1” I cried, at last. “ Let me have audi-
ence for a word or two. Is this the extent of your
accomplishments?” I asked, when things had
quieted down a bit.
“ Oh, no ! I recite. Little things of me own.”
“Recite, then,”commanded the red-haired boy,
whom someone introduced as George Rignold.
“ A speech, a passionate speech ! ”
The lady’s elocution was wonderful; her ges-
ticulation was more so. First the right hand was
shot out from the shoulder; then the left; then
both together, punctuating the lines —which she
said were her own, and we believed her.
“Oh, Sydney, it is a very nice place,
The girls are young, and like a taste—”
is as far as I can remember of the drivel.
There was vociferous applause when she finished,
and the comedy-man offered to buy the lines from
her, if she would allow him to recite them in the
next piece.
“Not me ! ” she replied, knowingly. “They’re
worth more than you could ever afford to pay.”
“ Can you dance—step-dance ? ” asked the red-
haired boy.
“I s’pose I could learn,’’ answered the lady,
haughtily. “It’s never took me long to learn
anything yet.”
Of course they offered then and there to teach her.
PRODIGAL.
PARSON : “ That lady, sir, is most valuable as a helper in
the work of the church. She has a great deal more
influence over those young prodigals yonder than
I have."
B OUNDER: “ I can very well believe it I One generally
associates prodigals with calves !”
“ All you have to do is to hit the floor with your
toe first, and then your heel; just go on doing it
quickly, in time; that’s all. Now, try.”
She wasn’t shy, And before long they had her
on a chair patting away for all she was worth, to
the accompaniment of the comedy-man’s im-
promptu violin.
When the dance was over, they took her into the
property-room, and made her up with lamp-black
and red paint.
I was called away to the stage before the opera-
tion was over, but I heard a little later from the
red-haired boy that, when he left, they were
measuring her for . But there 1 I don’t know
if that was true.

Polynesians are fond of jollification, and
some of the more kindly planters in the sugar-
districts give their boys a Xmas picnic every
year—with roast bullock and baked potato trim-
mings. Tommy Tanna goes in for style, too. At
a recent Bundaberg kanaka festivity the “ boys ”
ran up a big piece of bunting and attached
thereto 30 one-pound notes —in token of their
affluence. Two hundred S.S. Islanders were pre-
sent, but not a note was stolen.
MY SELECTION.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
Oh, *lx sun may burn and blister when the Drought King holds
his sway,
A nd the gold light of the morning may deepen into gray;
A nd the promise of the Spring-time be a promise till it dies,
Yet the sight of my Selection is a cure for sun-baked eyes;
As cool it is and smiling as the Promised Land of old—
And I fenced it in securely with a little hoop of gold.
I fenced it in securely, I stocked it well with Love,
Unwithcred by the fiercest sun that ever burnt above;
And though the grass be shrivelled, and waterless the tanks,
T hold my sweet Selection unmortgaged by the banks;
When 1 ride as rides the Dervish to his oasis of palms,
My Selection comes to meet me with the baby in her arms!
G.P.Q.C.


Investigating- Flora.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
WAS in scientific circles
That the great Professor
Brown
Had a world-wide reputation
As a writer of renown.
He had striven finer feelings
In our natures to implant
By his “ Treatise on the-Morals
Of the Red - eyed Bulldog
Ant.”
He had hoisted an opponent
Who had trodden unawares
On his “ Reasons for Bare
Patches
Oil the Female Native Bears ”
So they gave him an appointment
As instructor to a band
Of the most attractive females
To be gathered in the land.
’Twas a “ Ladies’ Science Circle ”
Just the latest social fad
For the Nicest People only,
And to make their rivals mad.
They were fond of “ science rambles ”
To the country from the town—
A parade of female beauty
In the leadership of Brown.
They would pick a place for luncheo
And catch beetles on their rugs ;
The Professor called ’em “optera”—
They called ’em “ nasty bugs.”
Well, the thing was bound to peris l
For no lovely woman can
Feel the slightest real interest
In a club without a Man—
The Professor hardly counted :
He was crazy as a loon,
With a countenance suggestive
Of an elderly baboon.
But the breath of Fate blew on i,
With a sharp and sudden blast,
And the “Ladies’ Science Circle”
Is a memory of the Past.
There were two-and-twenty members,
Mostly young and mostly fair,
Who had made a great excursion
To a place called Dontknowwhere,
At the crossing of Lost River,
On the road to No Man’s Land.
There they met an old selector,
With a stockwhip in his hand,
And the sight of so much beauty
Sent him slightly “ off his nut ” ;
So he asked them, smiling blandly,
“ Would they come down to the
hut 1 ”
“lam come,” said the Professor,
In his thin and reedy voice,
“ To investigate your flora,
Which I hear is very choice.”
The selector stared dumbfounded,
Till at last he found his tongue :
“ To investigate my Flora !
Oh, you howlin’ Brigham
Young !
Why, you’ve two-and-twenty
wimmen—
Reg lar slap-up wimmen, too !
And you’re after little Flora !
And a crawlin’ thing like you !
Oh, you Mormonite gorilla !
Well, I’ve heard it from the
first
That you wizened little fellers
Is a hundred times the worst !
But a dried-up ape like you are,
To be marchin’ through the
land
With a pack of lovely wimmen
Well, I cannot understand ! ”
“ You mistake,” said the Professor,
In a most indignant tone
While the ladies shrieked and
jabbered
In a fashion of their own—
“ You mistake about these ladies,
I’m a lecturer of theirs ;
I am Brown, who wrote the
£ Treatise
On the Female Native Bears !’
When I said we wanted flora,
What I meant was native flowers.”
“Well, you said you wanted Flora ,
And I’ll swear you don’t get ours !
But here’s Flora’s self a-comin’,
And it’s time for you to skip,
Or I’ll write a treatise on you,
And I’ll write it with the whip !
Now, I wants no explanations ;
Just you hook it out of sight,
Or you’ll charm the poor girl some’ow ! ”
The Professor looked in fright :
She was six feet high and freckled,
And her hair was turkey-red.
„ the track *
if or the hapless old Professor
rr , , ,
Hasn t sense to guide ’em back ;
Alld they clutch at one another>
And they yell and scream in fright
As they see the gruesome creatures
The Professor gave a whimper,
And threw down his bag and
fled,
And the Ladies’ Science Circle,
With a simultaneous rush,
Travelled after its Professor,
And went screaming through
the bush !
At the crossing of Lost River,
On the road to No Man’s Land,
Where the grim and ghostly gum-trees
Block the view on every hand,
There they weep and wail and wander,
Of the grim Australian Night ;
And they hear the mopoke’s hooting,
And the dingo’s howl so dread,
And the flying foxes’ jabber
"From the gum-trees overhead ;
While the weird and wary
wombats,
In their subterranean caves,
Are a-digging, always digging,
At those wretched people’s
graves;
And the pike - horned Queens-
land bullock,
From, his shelter in the scrub,
Has his eye on the proceedings
Of the Ladies’ Science Club.

THE BEST RIM IS
THE DUNLOP /
.WELCH-IRIM/
Tlxe most enjoyable
part or Cycling
Is to go away touring with a party of friends during your Xmas
and New Year’s holidays with a reliable machine under you,
fitted with Multiflex
DUNIOP Tyres
knowing that you can safely take you machine over the roughest
of country tracks without fear of tyre troubles. This feeling of
security can only be ensured by having Dunlops fitted —as no other
tyre will give the same com-
fort and speed, and yet have
the strength and durabi-
lity to withstand successfully
12 months’ knocking about on
the roads : a statement we en-
dose by guaranteeing all our
roadster tyres for that term.
Nothing will Spoil
a Cycle Tour
more effectively than for one of the party to be
riding a cycle fitted with unreliable tyres, which
are continually causing trouble, thus upsetting
the pleasures of yourself as well as your com-
panions. To guard against such remedies as
coming home by rail or cab, every tourist should
make a point of riding nothing else but Dunlops,
and they can then rest assured that they will be
free from troubles caused by faulty tyres.
BEWARE OF IMITATIONS!
As imitation tyres, purporting to be Dunlops, are sometimes foisted
upon unsuspecting cyclists, we beg to warn all cyclists that no tyre
is a genuine Dunlop unless the cover and tube is embossed with'

A Twisted Idyl.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
Charteris, the artist with the lovely wife,
A casual friend of mine, told me the story
In a chance mood of careless confidence . . .
Among the privileges of my youth,
Two girls I knew. One of them loved me ; one
I loved. So very comely were these two ;
So fair, so young, I was half-pitiful
And more (I think) than half-contemptuous
Of my poor heart that could not shelter both.
Madge (who loved me) was tender, trustful, true,
Bewitching in her modest grace ; and Nell
(She whom I loved) was petulant, self-willed,
Feigning no fealty to Love, no care
For those Love vanquished. So it came that each
Was natural foil to the other.
Madge was fair —
Fair as a harvest morning. Her sweet eyes
Suggested shaded corn-flowers touched with dew,
Or that cool corner of the dawning’s sky
Remotest from the jocund sun. Her hair
Was like the sun itself, or like the sun
Seen through a crystal cup of amber wine.
She neither bound nor braided it; it fell
In a soft-rippling wealth of fleeciest gold
Careless about her shoulders, here and there
Touched with a coppery tint that brightened it
And made its gold the richer. At her neck
And round the wee pink ears, more dainty than
Shells of the Happy Islands, vagrant tresses
Curled crisply into ringlets which (although
Dear modest Madge had blushed to dream of it)
Were olamorous for kisses. Her soft lips,
Fresh as the bloom on early dewberries,
Were sweet and maidenly, nor skimp nor full;
Her teeth’s pure ivory peeped demurely through
them—
Ah, God ! the kindest mouth in all the world,
And quite the purest! Then the dear girl’s head
(So wealthily adorned) was finely poised
On perfect shoulders. Even in her teens
Madge was full-bosomed ; even in her teens,
She had a certain gracious motherliness
Which made all children love her, and all men
Love children for her sake, and her for theirs.
And when men saw her, natural desire
Of the fair girl’s bright beauty straight was
crushed
Back, as a something in its essence base,
So sweetly pure and purely sweet she was. . .
And this girl loved me, though I loved her not,
Save as a decorative incident,
As men love charming women within their reach
And yet respected. Had she hidden her love
Beneath some guise of scorn or coquetry,
It might have won me, perhaps; one never knows.
But though she ne’er by conscious sign or glance
Revealed it, it lay plain. I recognised it
By many infallible signs. I pitied her;
And loved myself the better, pitying her;
And by that double pity loved Nell more.
Nell was a wisp of girl—tall, willowy, slight;
What the keen French call svelte : no other word
So well describes her. Dark as Night she was,
And bright as noonday. Her disturbing eyes
Were wells of inky blackness, but aswim
With all the poisoned light of all the world.
Her mouth ?—it seemed that ages of desire,
Legions of lovers’ heats, had blossomed there
Into the perfect flower of passion and
All ardours concentrate. Her lips were full,
And curled like those of Walter Crane’s ideal;
Always a little apart, as though they feared
To touch each other’s fires. Her nose was small,
Wide at the nostrils, just a shade retroussi ,
As Love would have it. Hair a trifle coarse,
But lustrous and abundant, odorous of
Herself : herself, whose every charm combined
To make her matchlessly desirable.
Her every line breathed passion and allurement,
From the proud head to the small, high-arched
feet,
Piquant and most provocative.
I saw her
For the first time (the night she maddened me
To such a love as shook me half to death)
In evening-dress —that wanton garb in which
Our modest women ape immodesty,
And so wield weapons which they wot not of ;
Trick-out their charms for market, as it were :
Our curious modern women ! . . . But, of Nell.
Her arms were bare to the shoulders. Exquisite
arms,
As lithe as Hebe’s, dimpled at the elbows
And at the wrists, ending in small, ringed hands —
Small tyrannous hands which straightway clutched
my heart
And sealed my thraldom. Her small breasts were
bare
Almost to the nipples, in the modern way :
Impertinent breasts jutting to right and left
As though in cool derision of beholders ;
And as her lissom form swayed in the dance
I stood and watched her. Then I danced with
her
(Five minutes introduced), and at the end
Of that first dance I told her that I loved her.
She was not shooked nor in the least surprised,
But laughed quite frankly in my face, and laughed
My hopes to soom with queenly-soft contempt.
So I (no babe with women) set out to win her,
And put my soul into the chase. I played
Relentlessly on all her nerves, her moods,
Her dormant passionateness. I studied her.
And whetted her caprices to appease them.
I marked her tastes ; I wooed her mind to paths
Where maidens’ minds may feed on dangerous
sweets.
I stirred her blood with tales of war and death.
I stirred her pulse with tales of life and love.
With such success did I conduct the siege
That presently she thought she loved me;
And I observed her thought, and counted One!
So I went on, with all the Bubtle art
That men learn —from the Devil, possibly ;
But from the modern world, at anyrate.
I, who was godlike in my plans, was still
Doglike in my devotion. Thus the days
Passed quickly, and I saw that every day
Her eyes grew brighter at my coming, and
Her voice thrilled to a new note, tremulous,
Half-timid, all unlike herself; and then
I knew she loved me, and I thought she knew
I knew she loved me; and I was content.
For, when I spoke my love again, she flung
Weeping into my arms ; but in a little
Turned up that glorious mouth to my first kiss.
Dear man ! some moments make it worth the
while
To live, though life end in the bitterness
Of Hell and an eternity of pain.
The story ? That’s the story. Just, you see,
The ordinary idyl, somewhat twisted,
In just the ordinary way.
The sequel?
Oh, in the end of course I married Nell.
And in the end of course I loved dear Madge,
Who is not married yet.
And Nell, my wife ?
Oh, she loves me—(what is the vulgar phrase ?) —-
Worships the ground I tread on. . . Just, you see,
The ordinary idyl intertwisted.

[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
“ Well ! it’s like this,” said the sailorman to one
of the passengers who had found him splicing
wire-rope to leeward of the smoke-stack. “Aboard
deep-water wind-bags, providin’ the stores is good
in the fust place, an’ the ship is well-found in the
second place, skippers an’ mates doesn’t matter
muoh —it’s the oook kin either make ’er or break
’er, as the sayin is.
“ Yes,” went on the “ shell,” reflectively, “ I've
bin shipmates with a lot o’ cooks in my time, sir
all colors, too —an’ it’s suprisin’ _what a diff rence
it makes in the voy’ge if yer a bit chummy wi’the
cook. I was onct very chummy with a oook. On a
starvation-ship it was, too. The skipper ’ad ’is
missis aboard, an’ what she didn’t know that cook
mebbe might ha’ teached ’er. It was di’mond cut
di’mond, and no mistake. She took a set on the
cook from the fust; an’, as she served the cabin
stores out ev’ry mornin’ —never allowin’ the cook
no margin to work on —’e ’ad to brace mighty
sharp up to get to win’ward of ’er, I tell yer '
“Me an’ the cook liked that ship, though. E
used to tell me ev’ry day about ’is gettin’ the stores

Sunday mornin’; ‘ one side o’ bacon to last this
ship’s cabin a whole voy’ge ! No wonder none kin
be spared for the cook. Three rashers for the
capting’s ’er orders; two for the mate, two for
the second, an’ ’—after hesitating a bit— for
’erself; an’ there they are, the ’ole eight of em.
I believe,’ he Bays, workin’ away with a thin-
bladed knife on ’is razor-strop, ‘ that she oounted

“Well, sir, what do you think ’e does? ’E

the cabin; an’ me an’ you, Cockney, ’ill only : ave
two apiece; but they’re thicker nor the cabin
ones, so we ain’t agoin’ to make no complaints.’
“It was the same with everythin’ else. I used
to break up biscuit in a canvas-bag till it was fine
enough to make the cabin duff iugrejents more
nor the missis’s puddin’-mould would hold. Me
an’ the cook felt we couldn’t live without real rich
plum-duff of a Sunday.
“ Onct, wen the missis was measurin’ out some
currants for the cabin ‘ strike-me-blind ’—‘strike-
me-blind’s ’ rice, sir—the cook ’e picks a currant
up off the deck, wipes it very careful, an’ blows
the dust off it like, an’ then ’e drops it in the cup
along with the others. O’ course the missis seen
’im, an’ she sez, sharp—‘You might ’a’ kep’ that
one for yer trouble/ Cook, ’e drops ’is voice a
bit, an’ sez ’e was feared the mate might miss it.
‘lt wouldn’t be the only one that was missed,’
snaps she. ‘ I dare say,’ sez the cook, mysterious
like. ‘ I heer’d about it.’ ‘ What do you mean ? ’
she asks, gettin’ curious. ‘Oh! only somethin'
about navigation,’ sez cookie, like’s ’e was tryin’
to pass it off. ‘ Somethin’ the second-mate’s been
sayin’, I suppose,’ she sez, tryin’ to draw ’im. ‘ I
won’t mention no names,’ sez the cook, an’ I
dunno what they was talkin’ about, but I hears
’em sayin’ that another current would ’a altered
the course ; ‘ an’ I thought that might ha’ been it
you dropped, mum, so I picks it up,’ sez he,
smilin’.
“ Well, I suppose she must ha’ told the skipper
about this, for after that he was alius pokin’ about
the galley, tryin’ to find fault. But cook, ’e
never lets on to be nettled, an’ was alius very
respectful.
“ Onct, w’en the skipper was foolin’ aroun’ of a
Sunday mornin’ —bacon mornin’ that was—the
cook, ’e pretends to be lookin’ all roun’ the deck
very anxious like. ‘What’s wrong with you,
now ? ’ says the skipper. ‘ I’ve lost a rasher o’
bacon, sir,' says the cook. ‘ The wind must ha’
blowed it out o’ the galley. I can’t find it no-
where.’ The skipper looks a bit puzzled at this,
an’ the cook, goin’ back to the galley, sez, * Oh 1
it’s all right, sir, I’ve found it —two on ’em was
stuck so close together I thought it was one, sir,’
an’ cook whistles a hymn, while the skipper still
looks a bit puzzled.
“It ’appened that very day that me an’ the
cook was savin’ our bacon till nex’ day; an’ after
bre’kfust, the missis’s cat smells out where it was.
The cook seen her startin’ to chaw a rasher in the
weather-scuppers, an’ ’e made up very cautious
an’ coaxin’ to get it back. But pussy she knows
too much, an’, as ’e gets near, she Btands wi’ the
rasher in ’er mouth lookin’ sideways at ’im, an’
w’en ’e makes a grab, she makes a spring an’ away
into the cabin with ’er tail stuok up like the
mizzen, an’ the rasher in ’er mouth.
“ Well, sir, when the missis tumbled to ’ow
she’d be’n done, you bet it was ‘All hands
shorten sail,’ an’ I noticed that the skipper hisself
kep’ more out o’ 'er way than usual the nex’ few
days. Lucky we was soon in port after that. Me
an’ the cook left, an’ I hear ’e ’as a slap-up
resturong in Sydney now. Good luok to ’im, sez
I. He was a good shipmate.”

FOXS’ PURE INDIGO.
As the result of many years of experience, FOXS’ PURE INDIGO DYE is recognised as the best in the Market. The superiority of Pure Indigo over other
dyes may be briefly summed up as follows ... ..
FASTNESS OF THE DYE.—lndigotine, the colouring principle of Indigo, is insoluble in water, alcohol, ether, and dilute acids, and alkalies eitner nor o
cold, hence its extreme fastness for all conditions of ordinary wear and tear. It is also quite fast to. Sunlight, and for an allround dye there isnothing: supe
it. There is no need to point out there is m a jerfectly fast dye, as comparSTwith one which may be fast to light, but will not stand perspiration, o
washing, or vice versa. . , ~ . • t
<?TRRMr,TH Awn H ANDLE.—CIoth dved Pure Indigo is stronger and tougher than the same cloth dyed in other ways, owing to the dye-bath being
a comply 7ow temp” atee anl ie absence* of chemiclls or mordaunts. In almost all other dyes the cloth th“”ndLo Vat
then in the dye for some hours altogether. This always impoverishes the wool fibre, and destroys much of its natural lustre and softness, feeds thfdoth
with its soft, mellow liquor, adds to the fulness and richness of the fabric. Indigo Dyeing being a mechanical process rather than a chemical one, actually feeds tne__—_•
BU their standard cloths are stamped every two yards on the back,
and without this stamp are not Genuine.
These Celebrated Serges can be obtained from the leading Tailors and Drapers throughout the Australian Colonies.
See for yourselves that the Serge is stamped -FOX PURE INDIGO r as many dealers for the sake of an
extra profit try to sell inferior-dyed cloths, remarking “that they are just as good as Pure Indigo.”
The word FOX is a GUARANTEE of Soundness of i
Material and Quality of Dye of all Worsted Coatings, V

Mr. C. J. A. NIELSEN.
A Living Witness of the virtues of the
Alfaline Herbal Remedies.
Kalgoorlie, September 12, 1898.
To HBRR RABSMUBSBN.
Dear Sir.—l feel it my duty to write and tell you how
your remedies have cured me.
I suffered great agony with WEAK NERVES and
RHEUMATICS, and I sent for some of your ALFALINE
REMEDIES, which completely cured me, and I have felt
as well as I could wish, although it is two years ago.
I also tried your ALFALINE UNIVERSAL PILLS,
which completely cleared my skin and purified my blood,
and I am now using your ALFALINE HAIR RESTORER,
which has thoroughly cleaned the scalp and made the
hair grow again, and it has gradually turned the hair
from being grey to that of its original color. I have also
recommended your Remedies for a number of different
complaints and I have never known them to fail, but to
do all that was claimed for them. I have great pleasure
to recommend these remedies to all sufferers, as I know
they can be depended on.
You are at liberty to publish this as well as my photo.
Yours truly, O. J. A. NIELSEN.
Sciatica Cured.
Parliament House, Sydney.
To Hbrr Rassmussen.
Dear Sir.—l can truthfully assert that since using your
Eucalyptus Oil and Alfaline Rheumatic Pills I have ex-
perienced an immunity from my attack of sciatic. I have
recommended the Alfaline Remedies to a number of my
constituents, and I will do the same to all whom I hear
complaining of rheumatic attacks. With kind regards,
I have the honor to be, yours truly,
E. W. O’SULLIVAN, M.L.A.
Nerves, Liver, and Kidneys Cured.
175 Young-street, Annandale, Sydney.
To Hbrr Rassmussen.
Dear Sir,—Having suffered for some time from a com
plaint of the liver and kidneys, for which'l took medical
advice, with no effect, I one day was fortunate enough to
pick up one of your books in the bush. I was thus in-
duced to try your Alfaline Remedies, ana their.effect was
magical. I have often since recommended them to ray
neighbors, all of whom have felt the oenefit as well as
myself. I cannot express how glad lamat my recovery,
as several doctors had given me up, as my husband can
testify.—Yours truly, (Signed) Mrs. H. SMITH.

- Sth. Murwillumbah, Jan. 4, ’99.
Herr Rassmussen, Sj'dney.—Dear Sir,—Having just
finished the course of Alfaline Blood Pills and Alfaline
Liver and Kidney Pills, I have pleasure in stating- that
they have effected a complete and permanent cure, al-
though previous to trying them I had tried three different
doctors without effect. For the benefit of those who may
be suffering in a similar manner, and as a proof of my
gratitude, you are perfectly at liberty to publish this short
note in the interest of suffering humanity.—Yours Grate-

I, THOS. MUDIMAN, Master Tailor, of 327 Elizabeth-

hereby solemnly and sincerely declare as follows:
Whereas I suffered severely from a very troublesome

several doctors and many remedies, but all of no avail.
Whereas I, as a last hope, obtained some of Hkrr Rass-

this is over five years ago I have remained well ever since.

this solemn declaration conscientiously believing the same
to be true.

The City of Dreadful Thirst.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
The stranger came from Narromine and made his
little joke—
“ They say we folks in Narromine are narrow-
minded folk.
But all the smartest men down here are puzzled
to define
A kind of new phenomenon that came to Narro-
mine.
Last summer up in Narromine ’twas gettin’
rather warm—
Two hundred in the water-bag, and lookin’ like a
storm—
We all were in the private bar, the coolest place
in town,
When out across the stretch of plain a cloud came
rollin’ down,
And each man, simultaneous-like, to each man
said ‘ I think
That cloud suggests it’s up to us to have another
drink ! ’
There’s clouds of rain and clouds of dust—we’d
heard of them before,
And sometimes in the Evenin’ News we read of
‘clouds of war.’
But—if this ain’t the Gospel Truth, I hope that I
may burst—
That cloud that came to Narromine was just a
cloud of thirst.
It wasn’t like a common cloud; ’twas more a sort
of haze;
It settled down about the streets and stopped for
days and days,
And not a drop of dew could fall and not a sun-
beam shine
To pierce that dismal sort of mist that hung on
Narromine.
Oh, Lord ! we had a dreadful time beneath that
cloud of thirst !
We all chucked-up our daily work and went upon
the burst.
The very blacks about the town that used to
cadge for grub,
They made an organised attack and tried to loot
the pub.
We couldn’t leave the private bar, no matter how
we tried ;
Shearers and squatters, union-men and blacklegs
side by side
Were drinkin’ there and dursn’t move, for each
was sure, he said,
Before he’d get a half-a-mile the ‘thirst would
strike him dead ! ’
We drank until the drink gave out, we searched
from room to room,
And round the pub, like drunken ghosts, went
howling through the gloom.
The shearers found some kerosene, and settled
down again,
But all the squatter chaps and I, we staggered to
the train.
And, once outside the cloud of thirst, we felt as
right as pie,
But while we stopped about the town we had to
drink or die.
But now I hear its safe enough, I’m going back to
work
Because they say the cloud of thirst has shifted
on to Bourke.
But when you see those clouds about—like this
one over here—
All white and frothy at the top, just like a pint
of beer,
It s time to go and have a drink, for if that cloud
should burst
You d find the drink would all be gone, for that’s
a cloud of thirst ! ”
* * • »
We stood the man from Narromine a pint of half-
and-half.
He drank it off without a gasp in one tremendous
quaff;
“ I joined some friends last night,” he said, “in
what they called a spree ;
But, after Narromine, ’twas just a holiday to me.”
And now beyond the Western Range, where sunset
skies are red,
And clouds of dust, and clouds of thirst, go drift-
ing overhead,
The railway-train is taking back, along the West-
ern Line,
That narrow-minded person on his road to Narro-
mine.
THE BANJO.
D.G. : Was in Dannevirke (M.L.),
when there chanced that way a pug. who, in his
day, was not altogether unknown to fame. He
had dropped into Dannevirke to train for an
approaching scrap. A prominent railway-officer
was the pug.’s bosom friend, and in an evil hour
the railway man proposed that his friend should
take the local hall, and turn over a little honest
coin by showing the local talent how many pounds
of meat he could knock off them in a given time.
The pug. declared that it was a heaven-sent idea,
and accordingly the hall was engaged, the town
deluged with dodgers, and when the eventful
night came a score or two had to be turned away
from the doors and accommodated with boxes and
ladders at the windows at half-price. The pug.
and the railway-man (the latter was a bit of a
slogger himself in a quiet way) appeared on the
platform in pink fleshings and invited the local
talent to step up and be laid out. The locals
responded gamely and in a few minutes the plat-
form was littered with them. When the local
talent and its appetite for punishment were both
exhausted, the genial pug. informed the admiring
audience that he would proceed to show them the
way it was done. If some gentleman would
kindly step up on to the platform the pug. would
demonstrate how, without striking a blow in
return, the scientific fighter could prevent him
getting one blow home, simply by shifting his
head and twisting his body. Several responded
immediately, among them an old plate-layer. The
pug. eyed the old plate-layer suspiciously for a
second and then, apparently satisfied, commenced
his explanation with: “Now, you ‘job’ me in
the eye.” Said the old man, in a dull, monoton-
ous voice : “ I’ll job you in the eye.” Replied the
pug. : “No, not you; I’ll take the young ’uns
first. They’re more active than you.” Theoldman
replied in his dull way : “ Yes, you take the young
’uns first; they’re more active. Then I’ll job you
in the eye.” But the young ones didn’t manage
to do the pug. any real harm. He jerked
his head about as though it was on an indiarubber
band. He twisted his body as though it was an
animated spiral spring inside his fleshings, So
the young ’uns retired disgustedly. Then the old
plate-layer stepped up, swinging his fist about in
a clumsy fashion, and said in his dull, level, mel-
ancholy voice: “Now I’ll job you in the eye.”
The pug. poked his face forward for the old man
to stoush at. Next moment there was a yell, a
whirl, and the pug. shot out, right off the plat-
form, among the audience. Then the old plate-
layer flew at the railway man and chased him
round the platform, caught him in the corner,
and threw him also down among the audience, a
bashed-up wreck. The meeting went wild, and
streamed out to drink the plate-layer’s health.
There was a strange twinkle on the old man’s face
as he walked off the platform, chewing a straw,
and remarking, it was only a question of “hittin’
’em with both hands at once ; it kinder bustled
’em. That’s how I came to job him in the eye.”
And while we had the drinks the jobbed one fled
to an adjacent butcher’s for steak.
“ Steele Rudd ” : From 1850 to ’55 sta-
tioned at Surat, then the Never-Never and
furthest outlying settlement of (now) Queensland,
were Harry Whitty, Crown Lands Commissioner;
Thomas Davis (and wife), assistant; Lieut. Ful-
ford, Sergts. Graham and Skelton, and a black
‘force.” Of this pioneer party, Davis still lives,
and of the blacks and their ways in those days he
has something to say. Hear him from out the
depths of half-a-century :
The blacks a noble race? They were then ; also, brave
‘Y' ‘ h'ee and happy. See them, in hundreds, roaming
the rolling plains—naked, massive, athletic men and
women, carrying their camp-gear, their hunting and war
a F°xr S ’ fcheir ando ° (child), and —their hoary, helpless
old jathers and mothers, teaching a lesson in gratitude
and affection to much of our alleged civilisation ! See
them—again in hundreds-hunting the kangaroo; the
leaders leaving the main body and stealing on hands and
toes through grass and timber to locate the griemnn.
then the mob, gins, girls, howlah (boys), and men, divid-
ing into two sections, one moving adroitly to the right,
the other to left, and dropping out every hundred yards
or so, forming a huge circle around the’roos, then closing
in at a run, the bewildered marsupials bounding first one
way then another, some falling at the point of the spear,
hunt* 8 k rea king‘ through the circle of yelling, joyous
Before the blacks of the Maranoa and Balonne became
degraded and confused by the whites—even before they
were rounded up to walk in the ways of the Great White
Chief, Mestonei a unique kind of society prevailed
among the tribes—a set of class-distinctions regulated
and kept pure by strict observance of peculiar marriage-
laws. this social bidder consisted of eight classes, or
four sets, called—Males : Combo, Hippie, Murray, and
Cubbie. Females : Martha, Cabbatha, Bootha, and Hi.p-
jntlia. A Combo could only marry a Martha, Hippie a
Cobbatha, Murray a Bootha, and Cubbie a Ilippitha.
When a man lost his wife, another of his own rank was
supplied him ; or, if he achieved an act of bravery, he
would be rewarded with one, perhaps two, but the class-
breed was stringently observed. As a consequence, in
build and stature they had few rivals—mobs of clean,
healthy, muscular men, with hardly a diminutive one
among- them—never a piebald, and never an emaciated
mongrel. And not until the ’6o’s —not until the white
man, in all his vice and villainy, and civilised savagery
appeared did these class-distinctions become corrupt
and rapidly begin to disappear, and those manly, simple,
free, and independent people that roamed those torrid,
silent plains of the Maranoa become degraded and dis-
united.
The present proprietors of Clifton Gardens
—the place that used to be Chowder Bay—have
drawn attention to certain aspersions on that pic-
turesque spot contained in “ The Banjo’s ”
verses, “The Bottle-oh Man” (Bulletin,
18/11/’99). The bad associations of Chowder Bay
are dead now—in fact they have been dead some
years ; and the allusions were a bit of ancient his-
tory, The present generation of larrikins know not
Chowder ; the bottle-oh man who used to go
there is respectable and wealthy now—ot else
dead ; and the bottle-oh man’s donah is married
and has a large family. Chowder turned respect-
able in a single night, so to speak, and now it is a
place where one could invite the Governor to
dinner with perfect confidence. In fact, so abso-
lutely decorous has Chowder become under the
present management, that it is constantly the
scene of school and other picnics conducted under
the auspices of the clergy.
“ Hermes ” tells The Bulletin something
about Napier, in Maoriland :
The glory of Napier (M.L.) is its Marine Parade. The
Marine Parade is fenced off from the vasty deep by a
high concrete wall, and behind it the road, or street, has
been built up almost level with the top. On the seaward
side are seats and scraggy trees in coops. On the land
side are houses, and when tidal waves come, or great
gales blow (gales often blow on M.L. coast), the South
Pacific piles itself up against the wall and at last sweeps
right over it. Then the people who live on the Marine
Parade take to the upstairs rooms and drag all the move-
able furniture after them, and look anxiously at the
raging ocean and wonder if the trouble has reached a
point that justifies retreating through the back door into
the next street and thence to the hills that Captain Cook
called the “Isle of Scinde.” Altogether there is
a delightful spice 'of uncertainty about life on
the Marine Parade. Writer lived there once and
woke up one dark night with bristling hair. Had heard
a sound in his sleep, and the waking memory of it caused
the cold perspiration to trickle down into hi’s ear. Thera
is no more nerve-wrecking sound in the world than the
low, grating grind of the ocean against its bed when
shaken by an earthquake. Then a far-off rumble, like
distant artillery, from the volcano 90 miles away. Then
again the low “ ghar-r-r-r-r-ring” sound. Through the
window could be seen an expanse of brown in the pitchy
blackness. The brown was the ocean. Suddenly a streak
of white stretched right across it, and then—wough!
something had struck the front door, burst it in, and swept
right through the house. Then the night was filled with
shrieks and cries, “A tidal wave!” “Another’un like that
an’ the whole place’ll go ! ” said the master of the house.
We fled downstairs, and, guided by a bull’s-eye lantern
(everybody on the Marine Parade keeps a bull s-eye
ready for such occasions) plunged into the water, strug-
gled through some backyards, and started up White-
road for Shakespeare Hill. Suddenly the water poured
from between the houses, and someone caught writer by
the shoulder to keep himself from falling. It was an old
friend, who had recently got married, and the first ques-
tion writer asked him was, “Where’s the wife?” Said
this interesting party, “Gad, I forgot all about her ; she’s
down the other end of the Marine Parade, sitting-up with
Mrs. . I’d better go back for her—d’ye think another
buster’ll come before I can get there?” And he trotted
back after his forgotten bride. As it happened, the lady
and Mrs. had both taken to the hills, and Mrs.
increased the population under a tree 15min. later.

THE
“ Peooy-10-tbs-Slot ”
(aranj-o-pboo?-
The Horn, Sound Box, Travelling Arm, and Discs are JUST AS
ACCESSIBLE as in the ordinary well-known type of Motor, and any-
one desirous of adjusting the machine or CHANGING THE DISC
before starting it, may do so with perfect ease. Before the winding
mechanism can be released, it is necessary to put a penny in the slot
provided for the purpose, when the machine may be wound and started,
after which it will run for ONE TUNE ONLY, and then automatic-
ally lock itself. The person using the machine may then change the
needle and replace the record at will, and on placing a SECOND
penny in the slot the machine may be rewound. This operation may
be repeated any number of times.
I need hardly point out the great advantages of an automatic
machine in which the RECORDS or TUNES can be FREELY
CHANGED with absolutely NO TROUBLE or SUPERVISION.

COMPLICATIONS ,ALL YIELD TO CLEMENTS TONIC
An Influential Cure Worthy of Careful Perusal.
The Case of
Mrs. JOHN GEDDES.
[Reported for the JYeivtoivn Chronicle.)
When the tram cars pass by Enmore they
speed with a rush down a gentle incline,
skirting a park, over which the traveller
catches glimpses of the distant sea. Pre-
sently the tram gives a sudden swerve round
a bend, and the guard shouts, “ Victoria
Road ! ” It was here our reporter descended,
almost at the door of Mr. Geddes, a well-
known storekeeper of the Marrickville
district. He inquired for Mrs. Geddes, who
was, fortunately, at home, yet who answered
the reporter’s enquiries with some little
hesitation, as she does not like publicity ; at
the same time her feeling of thankfulness for
a remarkable recovery from dire sickness
was so great that she thought it only right
to others, placed as she had been, to put
her hesitation on one side, and make known
the true facts of the case.
“We were living at Bundanoon at that
time,” said Mrs. (leddes, “and owing to
some unknown cause I got into a bad state
of health, continued to get worse aud
worse, till my plight was quite pitiful.
This lasted for two years.”
“ How did your sickness affect you, Mrs.
Geddes?” asked (lie reporter.
“My m st serious trouble was indiges-
tion, which at 'aso came to such a stage
that I could not keep any food on my
stomach V Even when I tried to drink a
little pure water I should retch it up at
once ; and the water that came up when I
vomited would be quite black to look at,
showing, I think, that my digestive organs
were in a shocking and* deplorable state.
And yet all the time I had a strong desire
and craving to eat, and I dared not. There
was ever present a feeling of oppression and
weight upon my chest, and a sharp pain
between the shoulders that pierced right
through my body, so that it filled me with
apprehensions that my lungs were affected,
and that I should soon be a victim to con-
sumption. My limbs were in a constant
tremor, my heart palpitating with distress-
ing throbs. Neuralgia came in my face
and forehead, and was so bad at times I
thought I should go out of my mind. And,
with my general collapse, my eyesight
suffered ; clouds of mist hid my sight when
I tried to use my eyes for any length of
time. The natural colour of my skin
changed to a deep yellow, like one suffering
from jaundice, and I would almost have
passed for a mulatto. I am sure that my
nervous system was shattered. I was
weak, hopeless, and out of heart, and came
finally to that helpless condition that I
could not crawl as far as the back garden.
As it was, I utterly despaired of getting
better. I became very frightened, the least
noise upsetting me. I even dreaded, from
sheer nervousness, to go into the next
room.”
“ Did you not see a doctor or try remedies
of any kind ? ” enquired the reporter.
“ No ; Bundanoon, as perhaps you know,
is nine miles from Moss Vale, and the
charge made by a doctor coming that
distance in the country is quite beyond the
means of all but rich people. For my
indigestion I tried a number of the reme dies
so much advertised as cures for that com-
plaint, but they did me no good wkate yer.
And in the same way I tried the local
remedies for the neuralgic pains in my face
and forehead without benefit, for I did
not understand then, as I do now, that my
neuralgia was only one of the symptoms of
a deeply seated malady and impoverished
blood.” '-i ,
“But you found relief at last, did you
not, Mrs. Geddes ? ” s
“ Yes; when I had got fairly tired of
trying one thing and then another, it
happened that we were talking to a friend
of ours at Bundanoon, and who, having
some medical knowledge and experience,
was much consulted in the district. He
advised me very strongly to try Clements
Tonic ; and it was a happy day for me
when I did so. When 1 had bought a
bottle at the store, and commenced to take
it according to the directions, I found a
marvellous change for the better after the
first few doses ; and as I continued to take
Clements Tonic, all my troubles and pains
grew lighter and more easy, till my good
health returned. Before I had finished
taking the first bottle I could eat freely
without vomiting or retching my food up.
The neuralgic pain, the heart trouble, the
impaired vision, the pain between the
shoulders, and the wretched, despondent
feeling, together with my nervous weakness,
all yielded and faded away before the
recuperative influence of Clements Tonic ;
and when I found what the remedy was
doing for me, I stuck to it, and persevered
with it, and long after I had recovered, and
felt quite well, I continued to take Clements
Tonic, to make my recovery doubly sure,
for, being well again, nothing was so dread-
ful to me as the thought of a relapse. So J
made sure to properly clinch the cure. *’
“ And you found your cure genuine, Mro.
Geddes, and not a mere flash in the pan ? ”
enquired the reporter. •
“ Yes ; and after that I had the best of
health for several years, so I think my cure
was as genuine as a cure could be ; and you
may be sure I have recommended Clements
Tonic whenever I had the opportunity, and
this often occurs, for, as you see, my
husband and I are in business.”
“Are you willing that this testimony
should be made public ?”
“ Yes ; I feel that it is only right for me
to do so, for it may be the means of telling
some sufferer, with symptoms like my own,
that a sure cure is waiting in Clements
Tonic.”
STATUTORY DECLARATION.
I, Maggie Geddes, of Cook-road, Marrickville, in
the Colony of New South Wales, do solemnly and
sincerely declare that I have carefully read the
annexed document, consisting of four folios and con-
secutively numbered from one to four, and that it
contains and is a true and faithful account of my illness
and cure by Clements Tonic, and also contains my full
permission to publish the same in any way : and I
make this solemn declaration voluntarily, and without
receiving any payment, conscientiously believing
the same to be true, and by virtue of the provisions of
an Act made and passed in the ninth year of the
reign of her present Majesty, intituled “ An Act for
the more effectual abolition of Oaths and Affirmations
taken and made in the various Departments of the
Government of New South Wales, and to substitute
Declarations in lieu thereof, and for the suppression
of voluntary and-extra judicial Oaths and Affidavits.”

SCOTCH •<*
WHISKY
“Old 8
fellow”
Scotch Whisky is a delicious and finely blended whisky of excellent flavour, which, while maintaining ail the due
stimulating properties of the spirit, has been mellowed by age into a perfectly wholesome and mild beverage. The large scale
upon which the distilling and blending of “ D.C.L." is carried out guarantees regularity in quality—a great advantage, which
whisky drinkers often miss in other brands,
