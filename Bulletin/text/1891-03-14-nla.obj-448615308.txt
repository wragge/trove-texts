to the cork by a wire, so that the blacking can be used by
anyone without soiling the fingers. No polishing brush
is required. It dries immediately after being applied, and
will not soil the most delicate clothing.

AUTION.
( The extraordinary repulation of Rowland’s Macassar
Oil; Kalydbr and Odonto, induces some shopkeepers to
offer spurious imitations under the lure of being cheap;
the principle on which-each is prepared is confined
solely to the knowledge of A. Rowland & Sons, of 20,
Hatton Garden, London, and therefore it is highly
necessary to buy no Macassar Oil. Kalydor or Odonto
except those made by them, and which bear their
name in red ink on the wrappers.

This eminent Specialist, Founder, and Chief
Surgeon of the long-established and favourably-
known Dispensary that now bears his name, re-
ceived his medical education in the leading colleges
and hospitals of Europe.- lie has devoted a life-
time to the study of
PRIVATE, NERVOUS, AND SKIN
DISEASES.
He has by profound research thoroughly investi-
gated their origin, traced their deadly sources and
insidious dissemination, and ascertained the surest
and safest methods by which they may be eradi-
cated, with these widely recognised qualifications
combined with unswerving faithfulness to his
patients, he has during his practice, extending
over FORTY YEARS, attained a well-deserved
pre-eminence in their treatment. His practice
embraces diseases which probably cause more un-
happiness than any other class of troubles that
afflict mankind.
YOUNG MEN
who suffer from the results of early follies, trans-
gressions or excesses of more nature ago, bladder
difflculiies, a whitish or dark ropy sediment in
the water, accompanied by slight burning or
smarting sensation, 1 leadaches, Drowsiness during
the day, circles round the eyes, Giddiness,
irregularity of the bowelq specks before the eyes,
baOifulncFs, discontcntcdness, weakness or pains
in the back. Liver or kidney complaints, dreams,
buzzing noises in the oars and head, pimples, a
fear that something dreadful is about to happen,
weak stomach, yellow or blood-shot eyes, impure
blood, hasty, uhcOn'ro lablc temper, hacking
cough, who cannot marry, nervousness in society,
wakefulness, palpitation of the heart, general
weakness, and other symptoms which load to in-
sanity and death, should consult him, for ho has
mastered these difficulties. On receipt of 6d. in
stamps he will send secure from observation in a
plain wrapper, postage *
FREE, A LARGE CLOTH-BOUND
BOOK.
Showing plainly how all diseases of the private or
nervous system may be cured thoroughly and per-
manently without unnece:sary expence. This
book will prove a valuable companion, and even
though you be perfectly well its general inform-
tion and prescription may assist you in restoring
some poor friend to health even after his case has
been pronounced incurable by his medical at-
tendant.
ONE POUND IS SUFFICIENT TO
SEND
for Remedies necessary for the cure of NER-
VOUS DEBILITY. Should you require medical
treatment, as procrastination is sometimes dan-
gerous, it would be advisable for you to sit down
quietly in your chamber and write to the doctor,
detailing every experienced symptom. Ho will
on receipt of such a letter, write you, promptly
and courteously, a candid and straightforward
oponion of your case. If you do not think you
understand the case, send for his famous theiical
work, the price of which is but sixpence ; enclosed
in the volume will be found a Ist of carefully-pre-
pared questions, which will, in all probability,
assist you materially in describing your ailment.
Dr. Richards uses nothing but the purest remedies,
and never prescribes mercury under any circum-
stances. The moment letters arc carefully per-
used and answered they are destroyed by fire,
and patients may rest assured that their cases

SPECIALIST for the Treatment of Nervous
Complaints, Diabetes, Tumors, &c.
Registered by the Medical lip ir lof N.S. TP. L tie House Sur-
geon t > the (treat Northern Hospital, London
T am aware that I am not strictly following the paths
of professional etiquette by advertising myself as a
Specialist for the ti eatmrnt of this class of disease, but,
unfortunately for the suffering public in- Australia, the
apathy shown by Qualified Men in the treatment of
< (ironic and Nervous Complaints has induced men of the
lowest grade of intellect (whose only qualifications are
unlimited assurance) to spring up, and by specious
advertisements and false promises trap the unwary.
It is very evident that sufferers from these diseases
have been scandalously treated by these unqualified
persons The evidence taken at the Medical Enquiry
held in Sydney (published in the Daily Telegraph , Nov.
6th 7th nnd Sih, 1SOO) plainly shows the disgraceful
manner in which patients are duped. Not only are
they robbed of their money, but what is of infinitely
greater importance, their health is injured also. It is
therefore time that Legally Qualified Hen entered the
field to fight these peats of society with their own
weapons, viz., Advertising.
It is utterly impossible for those who are suffering
from the-'C diseases, who are scattered over all parts of
Australasia, to ascertain which Qualified Practitioner
makes these diseases his speciality unless he advertises.
I consider therefore, that by advertising I not only
strike a blow at the Quackery which noio exists, but I also add
to the usefulness of my profession and in no way lessen my
personal dignity.
My Qualifications I invite .the fullest investigation Into. For some cor. slder able time I was House Surgeon to the
Great Northern Hospital, London, where I had special opportunities of oLservin ; the many phases of the Nervous and
Sexual System, and to become acquainted with the most scientific methods of effecting their cure.
My sole attention is given to the treatmenfcof these diseases, and when a person consults me he is informed at the
commencement whether I can effect his cure or not. The patient is not deluded with false and specious promises, and
if I undertake the case
I Absolutely Guarantee a Complete and Permanent Cure.
My great success in the treatment of those diseases enables me to give this guarantee without fear.

No medical man advertising in these colonies has medical
degrees which can be compared with his. Such eminent
qualifications, together with his recognised straightfor-
ward treatment, has naturally_ gained for him the reputa-
tion of being the

tained by applying to any leading paper in the colony.
No diseases cause so much misery and distress as those
included in my speciality.
All Men Young and Old,
Suffering from the results of early follies or ex-
cesses, indigestion, foul mouth, costiveness, palpi-
tation, singing and pains in the ears and head,

memory, pains in the back and chest, varicocele,
diseases of the bladder, kidneys, or liver, rheuma-
tism, impure blood, weakening discharges, impaired
vigor, sterility,premature decay, stricture, nervous-
ness, groundless fears, bashfulness, lassitude, and
NERVOUS DEBILITY, should lose no time in
consulting him, since he has, by long experience
and thorough investigation of their nature, dis-
covered the safest treatment for their permanent
cure. Persons residing at a distance may be treated
at their own homes, without any interruption to
their business, by giving a full and clear descrip-
tion of their symptoms, and the necessary medi-

SATURDAY, MARCH 14, 1891.
The Farce of Constitution-Making.
The Bulletin was the first journal in Aus-
tralasia to organise the Australasian senti-
ment ; the first to systematically set itself to
undermine the contemptible provincialism
which had its root and branch, not in the
hearts of the people, but in the petty
jealousies and paltry ambitions of “colonial”
politicians. Through evil report and good
report, The Bulletin has never lost sight
of the ultimate destiny of the Australias :
a Federal Republic. It welcomed every
symptom of the growth of the federal spirit ;
it has by the force of invective, the force of
argument, and the force of satire sought to
stamp out of life and being every tendency
to provincialise the people of each “colony”
and of all the “colonies.” The magnificent
conception of a United Australasia which shall
by the expansive power of its own energies
create a new nation, and a new nation, more-
over, which shall teach the world how to
enrich the national life by ennobling the
quality of its individual manhood, and by
eliminating from the social system the dis-
integrating and degrading agencies of caste,
monopoly and privilege, first received form
and substance in these columns. Other
journals have fluctuated in their grasp of the
Australian principle: at one time, their sense
of the greatness of the Australian ideal has
reached the pinnacle of insane enthusiasm; at
another, it has penetrated, in the strange
declensions of character which witness to the
power of the capitalistic purse over the Aus-
tralian press, to the abysses of Little Pedling-
tonian prejudice. The Bulletin fearlessly
claims that from its first publication to the
present it has issued no number that
has not been consistent (wherever else it
has been weak), to the principle and
to the ideal involved in the phrase
of “ A Free Australia.” There have been
moments in its career when it might have
coined gold by pandering to a “ colony ” and
to a “colonial” “statesman.” Wherever
else it has consciously or unconsciously
swerved from the right and the light, here,
at least, it has been stable and devoted. It
has crystallised the right and focussed the
light until at last it can say without egotism
and without a departure from the truth, that
the Ideal is blending into the Actual.
Wordsworth speaks of an old man who all
his life long had kept before him in the
refectory where ho -broke his fast a picture
of the -Last Supper, and who, by strenuous
gazing, came to believe the pictured repre-
sentation real—
“ And he was fain invSSt
The lifeless thing with life from his own soul.”
“ Here daily do we sit,
And thinking of my brethren, dead, dispersed,
Or changed, or changing, I not seldom gaze
Upon this solemn oompanyyinmoved . .
By shock of circulTtßtffnce or lapse of years,
Until I cannot but believe that they—
They are in truth the substance.”
Within the lifetime of this journal, largely
because of its life-work, the faint imaginings
of the political dreamer have clothed them-
selves with reality. They have merged from
the Imaginary into the Possible, from the
Possible they have advanced to the Pro-
bable, from the Probable they can, if the
men of the Convention mount the hill
of opportunity, grow to-morrow into the
Present.

Why does The Bulletin thus aggrandise
its own relation to the Federal movement ?
Is it not lowering itself to the ignoble plane
on which a Parkes lives, and moves, and
has his parasitical existence ! Parkes never
lifted his little finger yet to achieve the
paltriest deed for the public that he did not
seek to blazon the significance of his act on
the brassy heavens. The true worker works
for the sake of the work and the sake of the
result. The sham works for the ephemeral
notoriety which any man can earn who is
vulgar enough to cater for the crowd. Why,
then, does The Bulletin assert it s claim to
be recognised as an agent in the Federal
cause ?
* * *
It does so because, from the consistency of
its past, The Bulletin has a right to be
heard as to the future ; and because, in now
raising its voice to censure the work of the
Convention, so far as that body has done any
work, it may not be truly accused of infidelity
to the Federal movement, or to the ideal
based on the Federal principle—a Republic
of the Federated Australias. The Bulletin
would be untrue to itself, and to the people
whose support has enabled it to grapple with
every form of public wrong with perfect
confidence as to the issue, if it did not
declare that, speaking from the heart of its
experience, it cannot bat regard the Conven-
tion as a huge mistake. The Bulletin hoped
almost against hope that when the Conven-
tion assembled in all its majesty as a gather-
ing of the select-men of the Australasian
provinces, it would justify its existence by a
declaration of its faithfulness to the Austra-
lian ideal. It has done nothing of the sort;
it has started with a farce ; it can hardly
help closing its session with a blunder ; it
will be in the mercy of Providence if it
does not consummate a crime.

Placed in the midst of “ pathless summer
seas” and isolated alike from the tumultuous
West and the “ unchanging East,” Australia
was left practically undiscovered till the Old
World had been partially regenerated by the
most awful of ordeals, and till the New
World of the American States had demon-
strated to the Universe how much greater
the democratic instinct is, as a creative
national force, than the traditions of
monarchies and of empires. In the order of
Providence or in obedience to evolutionary
law, state the fact as you will, this virgin con-
tinent, a paradise in its promise of freedom
and felicity to the groaning millions of
Europe, was defiled consciously and
of malice aforethought defiled—by the
“ greatest nation under the sun.” That
original sin against the destinies of the Aus-
tralias was the first of along, an interminable
series. Prating of liberty to her colonies
always, of progress ever, Britain never con-
ceded a privilege, never abandoned a right
that was not wrested from her. Her classes
—not her people, but her ruling and domi-
nant classes—did not treat this country as
their footstool only because they had used
it as their cesspit. They sent out to
administer her affah’s the bastards or the
toadies of her great men. Their notion of
colonisation was to steal the lands for their
spawn and to find places for their parasites.
Till the gold discoveries this principle of
government operated. Then, a change
took place, but it was one of aspect only ;
the essence of the policy was the same and is
the same to-day. “ The Australias are still
‘our colonies. ’ They are for our exploitation.
We may not crush them ; in spite of all they
have grown too strong for us to do that.
But we can bribe them, emasculate them,
frighten them, tickle them. Bribe them
with our wealth, deprive them of their man-
liness by gratifying their love of show and
vanity, frighten them by telling them that
without us they are at the mercy of Russia
and Germany, tickle them by applauding
their ‘greatness’ and their ‘progress.’” Now
the nation which says this is a nation which
is so rich that millions of her people lack
bread ; which breeds lords, but cannot breed
a man who does not sooner or later rise to
curse her ; which is so strong that one great
naval defeat will debase her to her enemy’s
feet; which is so glorious that the outer skin
of her magnificence envelopes a deadly
loathsomeness like that of the Dead Sea
fruit. It is this class-ruled, caste-ruled
country that seeks to keep the Australias in
subjection. And so long as she does so, so
long will the Australias never attain to the
measure of their national greatness, or a
single son of Australian soil grow to the
height and the dignity of his individual
manhood.

These are truisms familiar to every man
who has steadily kept his eye on the Austra-
lian ideal. But will you find a solitary
expression of like significance in the volume
of calk already uttered by the members of
the Convention ? Not a syllable ! Nothing
to indicate that a syllable of the kind
will be ever uttered by any delegate !
.Where the delegates, speaking outside or
inside of the Convention, have been led for
a moment to glance at the crux of the
Imperial connection, they have studiously
evaded coming to close quarters with it. The
root-question of Federation is not the
tariff but that of States’-rights What
powers shall the individual States delegate to
the Central Government, and what reserve ?
But inextricably implied with the question
of States’-rights is this : Is an Australian
province, a free and sovereign State '{ The
Bulletin contended months ago that it
essentially is so, though not in name. The
Sydney Morning Herald has just come to
the same conclusion. No other paper that
we know of has made the same admission,
and the members of the Convention have
displayed an equal taciturnity. The dele-
gates’silence may be attributable to ignorance
of the bearing of the question—-or it may be
—we do not mince our terms—to cowardice.
We believe it to be the latter. We do not
think the picked politicians of the provinces
can be so unintelligent as to be in ignorance
of what every superficial student of Federal
institutions must be informed.
For an assertion, implied or direct, of free
and sovereign State-hood involves a Declara-
tion of Independence. A Sovereign State
cannot be a dependency, cannot remain a
“ colony.” The Sovereignty of a State is the
inalienable right of its people. It cannot be
alienated. To establish a “ Federation under
the Crown ” such as every delegate who has
yet spoken has virtually confessed to be the
object of the present Convention, there
must be an alienation of essential Sovereignty,
The Crown is Sovereign, otherwise terms
are meaningless ; and for the Crown—
an outside and exterior power—to hold
the Sovereignty of the Australias is to com-
pel them to continue in a condition of
dependency. Substitute, however, for the
Crown a President elected by the people,
and he becomes the expression of their
Sovereign power. There is no alienation of
the Sovereignty ; there is simply a temporary
delegation, periodically resumed. The sub-
stitution of a President for the Crown
would, by one act, solve the problems and
straighten out the anomalies which must
otherwise entangle the feet of the constitu-
tion-makers at every step of their way. The
delegates have talked for a week on the
power of veto. As scientific legislators they
should adhere to the recognised meaning of
terms and phrases. The power of veto, in
the judgment of every publicist of repute is
essentially a prerogative of the Sovereign—
call the Sovereign President, Queen, or what
you please. The delegates have been discus-
sing it as though it rested solely in the hands
of what, following Parkes’ example, they
choose to call the Senate. Over and above the
Senate is the symbol of Sovereignty, which
is to be, if the Convention proceed on the
lines already laid down, a Governor-General
appointed by the Crown and responsible
only to the Crown. This is what we mean
when we say that the Convention is per-
petrating a blunder, and possibly a crime.
Because its members dare not—if they dare,
what would become of their titles ?—face the
problem, of the Imperial Connection, they are
consenting to an alienation of the sovereignty
of the people who ostensibly chose
them to preserve their national interests.
No people can constitute a nation unless
they are free; no people are free whose
sovereignty is a prerogative of an exterior
power ; and, gloss the matter as one may, a
nation that cannot work out its destiny
without reference to Imperial interests is
not a nation at all. It is merely a colony of
dependants and not of freemen.
How Rents Keep Up.
Mb. Albert Dawson, of Mittagong (N.S.W.).
writes to The Bulletin as follows :
Your leading article “How Rents Go Up,” in your
issue of January 31, is one which I think will commend
itself with more than ordinary force to the bulk of your
readers. It is particularly lucid, and goes right to the
bed-rock of the labour-poverty question, and its reproduc-
tion in, say, three months’ time would meet with approval
from a majority of subscribers. The position taken by you
in “How Rents Go Up” is that increase of population
practically means increase of rent, decrease of wages, and
consequent increase of poverty, and in the year of our
Lord, 1891, the position is good and incontrovertible.
Just so. Now, how docs this square with your persistent
advocacy of Protection ? What would be the result of a
“ useful ” protective policy in New South Wales ? Simply
this. An additional army of 50,000 or so of labourers
would be required in order to make in the province the
articles which are now imported, and for all practical pur-
poses the effect would be—-according to your own argu-
ment—to increase rents, decrease wages, and increase
poverty. Now, would it not be wise, before we rush for
progression (?) and poverty after the manner of other
deluded countries, to work for the abolition of the social
conditions which tack increasing poverty upon so-called
progress. First obtain conditions which will allow in-
crease of population without a more than corresponding
increase of poverty, before we adopt a fiscal policy which
means—if it means anything—an influx of labour ;or the
effect, according to “ How Rents Go Up,” must be in-
jurious, anyhow to the present inhabitants of the country.
The strongest reason that can be urged against Protection
is that its introduction brings a young country more
quickly into conditions of population and poverty which
are found so deplorable in older countries, conditions
which may culminate in destructive revolution ; and
many of your readers are at a loss to reconcile your well-
known efforts and sympathy with the working classes
with your advocacy of Protection.
The above letter expresses accurately the great
argument of the Foreign-trade-mm-Single-tax
organisation in New South Wales, which con-
sists in assuming that because one mistake is
correct, therefore another blunder must be
right. Protection and Socialism, it is asserted,
cannot go together, and though the assertion is
as incapable of proof as the statement that
toothache cannot exist along with the Shorter
Catechism, or that baldness and cats are two
hostile principles, still the assumption does a
lot of service. The position which The Bulle-
tin takes up is certainly that increase of popu-
lation is invariably accompanied by increase of
rents and a general reduction of vv'Ages, but
beyond that it dissents from Mr. Dawson’s
assumptions in tolo .
lii the first place, it does not necessarily
follow that Protection will increase population,
nor is it any part of its business to do so.
There is no special blessing in the multiplica-
tion of inhabitants, and the mere fact of there
being two men where there used to be only one
does nob prove that the country is either richer
or happier or more intelligent for the change.
The object of Protection is to increase the
material prosperity of the nation, but, by some
ironical cussedness on the part of Nature, popu-
lation often multiplies fastest, and families are
largest, where there is least prosperity. When
New South Wales adopts Protection "there will
be work for many hundreds of individuals who
arc at present unemployed, but it is irrational
to suppose that there will be work for 50,000’
imported labourers in addition to those already
in the province. Protection tends to make a
nation self-supporting—to make .the one in illicit
producers of the country produce enough to’
supply the one million consumers, which vir-
tually means that one average producer will
make enough wealth to maintain the average
consumer. To assume, however, that Pro-
tection must bring in a vast influx of
new labourers is to assume that under
the protective system one inhabitant will
be able to consume so much that he must im-
port and hire another inhabitant to keep him
to produce it, consequently they would have to
import two more to help both of them, and an
additional four afterwards to assist the lot. If it
be necessary to bring in 50,0000 labourers to work
for those already in the country, then it would
also be necessary to import another batch to wor k
for these 50,000, and so on ad infinitum. In-
crease of comfort and increase of population do
not go together except by accident. There is
incomparably loss poverty in protected France
than in any other country in Europe, yet the
French nation is not increasing, while the
squalid Chinaman multiplies without ceasing.
The population of the East End of London
grows far faster than that of the West, and the
average family of the costermonger is twice as
large as that of the millionaire. Protection,
however, can neither hinder nor hurry uo this
process, and it doesn’t want to.
* * *
But even supposing that Protection neces-
sarily involved a sudden and violent increase of
population, and admitting the obvious fact that
with increase of population comes increase of
rent and consequent diminution of wages, it is
hopelessly absurd to assume that Freetrade
could reverse the latter part of the process.
The machine works in one direction only—it
positively refuses to go backwards. If popu-
lation increases, rents go up ; if population
remains stationary rents still go up; if it
diminishes rents in most cases go up likewise,
and the only difference is that they go up
more slowly. The population of Ireland
has fallen off nearly 50 per cent, and rents have
risen about 100 per cent. ; that of the North of
Scotland has declined in like manner and with
the same result. By turning a vast extent of
country into grouse and deer preserves an arti-
ficial scarcity of land has been produced, and
the alleged law of demand and supply has done
the rest. Even if there are only twelve men on
a whole continent rents can be kept expanding
by judicious manipulation. The theory that
increase of population should not be encouraged
until we have arrived at a social state which
allows of increase of population without increase
of poverty is good—as a theory, but it is
nothing more, for poverty increases all the
same only a shade less rapidly, and in any case
the increase of population cannot be checked,
except by infanticide or some similar device.
And, further, it must be remembered that the
social revolution cannot be brought about except
by the pressure of humanity ; if keeping down
the population meant keeping down the number
of social oppressors it would be reasonable
enough, but it really means a steady thinning
out of the ranks of that great army which must
one day rise to achieve the freedom of the
human race. Moreover, even if Protection did
“ bring a young country more quickly into con-
ditions of population and poverty which are
found so deplorable in older countries,” it is
only one of many agencies all tending in the
same direction, which cannot, by means of any
human effort, be abolished or postponed till man
learns how to make the best use of them, and it
is not advisable that they should. The sooner
the evil comes, the sooner will the remedy be
found, for the human race is a slow-moving
concern, which travels only under the pressure
of necessity, and never looks for a cure until
the disease is upon it.
* * *
Australia was comparatively happy and pros-
perous in the earlier days, when the population
was very thin and the country very poor, but if
the population had remained as then and the
country as poor as it was then, the landlord
and the monopolist would have come to infest
the land and destroy its happiness all the same.
They came along with the influx of population,,
but if there had been no influx they would have
come by themselves. If the census returns
declined to zero again they would remain not-
withstanding—at all events, they would be the
two last men to abandon this deserted con-
tinent. If Freetrade keeps the country poor
they will be here nevertheless, for no country is
so poor that the landlord cannot extract some-
thing from it; if Protection makes it rich they
will be found hanging round with their accus-
tomed vigour. Some day, however, the
nation will wake up and get rid of them
both, and Australia will belong to the Aus-
tralian people for the first time in its
history, and if the country has grown rich
in the meantime there will be so much the more
for the nation. Then if Protection has created
wealthy monopolies, as its enemies so loudly
assert, the State will confiscate these monopolies
for the public benefit ; whereas, if Freetrade
has kept down monopoly it can only do it by
making the country sfi poor that there is little
for a monopoly to feed upon, and then it is
obvious that there is also nothing for the State
to confiscate, and the public benefit is nil. And
finally, if monopolies, whether created by Pro-
tection or otherwise, should lead to revolution
it is gratifying to think that there will at least
be something to “ revolnshe ” for, and that the
great upheaval will pay a dividend. About the


most lamentable thing on record is a revolution
that is a dead loss to everybody concerned, and
it isn’t worth while for any nation to regain
possession of its native land if its native land
he not worth having.
PLAIN ENGLISH.
A Promising Freetrade Industry.
About three years ago, when the Park es Pro-
trade Free-tection Cabinet was in an earlier
stage of its wild career, it resolved to apply its
great, though somewhat mixed, principle to the
tobacco-industry, with a view to helping on
that business and boosting the prosperity of the
country ; and the consequences of its action are
now beginning to be apparent. Under the old
regime the duty on imported American leaf was
slightly in advance of that upon the locally-
grown article, and the Parkes Government saw
in this a trace of the nefarious system of Pro-
tection. The duties, therefore, were equalised ;
that is to say, there was no attempt at
establishing Freetrade, but, as the nearest
approach to it, it was resolved to discourage
the Australian industry as much as the foreign,
and then let them take their chance. When a
deputation of tobacco-manufacturers appealed
against this arrangement the Treasurer in-
formed them, with an idiotic candour that no
other Freetrader ever arrived at, that the
alteration was made became they used too much
of the Australian and too little of the American
production, and the deputation, being too much
astonished to reply, fled in confusion. They
had come to point out that the new arrange-
ment would ruin the tobacco-growing industry
in New South Wales, and before they could get
started the small, dried-up importer who ran
the Treasury, blandly informed them —almost
in so many words —that his object was to ruin
the local industry, for the benefit of the im-
porters. They wanted to state that the innova-
tion would divert the trade from Australia to
America, and the disastrous financier broke
them up by explaining that his object was to
divert trade from Australia to America, and
damn the local producer for the sake of the
foreigner. They didn’t even have energy
enough left to ask him why the Parkes Free-
trade tariff was actually heavier than the
Dibbs- Jennings Protective tariff, and if they
had asked him he would probably have been
unable to explain the matter himself; the
situation was too astonishing for argument, and
they simply retreated and left the man who
stated that he wanted to cripple Australian
industry in possession of the field. Since
then the tobacco trade has gone the
way of every other trade in which the
Parkes Government has taken a hand.
The American tobacco, grown in a more favour-
able climate and on a more favourable soil,
cultivated by cheap nigger labour, and brought
to Sydney at a cheap rate of freight, is actually
protected against the Australian article. The
African who is plentiful in the Southern States
of America is so inexpensive, and the charges
for carriage by sea are so low, compared with
the price of Australian labour and the pon-
derous railway charges from the interior, that
the Australian leaf virtually pays a heavy tax
for the benefit of the Virginian planter. At
the present moment there are 2500 tons of un-
saleable tobacco stored in the Tumut, Gundagai
and Murrumbidgee districts. The value of this,
in the days before Parkes’ latest resurrection,
was about £233,000 ; under the new system of
protecting foreign nations and calling it Free-
trade, the value has sunk to about £lOO,OOO ;
and as the actual cost of production is about
£130,000, the produce is stored up, in the hopes
that the Parkes Ministry may die a natural
death, or go mad, or get lost, and give the
country a new lease of existence. Many of the
growers have already collapsed, and the rest
hold on simply because all their money is sunk
in their plantations, and, therefore, to abandon
the struggle means ruin, while to go on cannot
mean more than ruin, and if they can hold out
longer than Parkes the disaster may still be
repaired. Meanwhile, the actual loss to the
planters is about £130,000 per annum; the
tobacco manufacturers are in a bad way ; the
consumer reaps no benefit, for prices are as high
as ever they were ; and the profit goes entirely
to the importers, and does not even remain in
the country, for the importers are themselves
imported, and the dividends go, as a rule, to
the “ head office” in London.

An Unfinished Insurrection.
The alleged Queensland insurrection has dropped
out of sight as completely as if there had never
been any insurrection at all. The story didn’t
come to any reasonable conclusion ; it merely
tailed off in dismal silence, and the narrative
broke down, and the whole perjury fell dead
for want of something to lean against. The
daily press has given no explanation of this
incoherent ending—it simply gave up the melo-
dramatic gag, and went away, leaving it lying
there. It had got the imaginary insurrectionist
out, and mounted him on an alleged horse, and
started him over the face of the earth in an
armed condition and howling for blood. Then
it got the police and soldiers and horse-artillery
up to meet him, and planted the two parties
face to face, and it pointed out the unre-
lenting ferocity and inhuman fury of the shearer,
and the cold, stern, adamantine resolution of the
troops, with such vigour that it was obvious
neither of them could back down by any
possibility. Consequently, having brought them
together the only possible thing left to telegraph
about was the battle that ensued, and the
carnage and blood and flames, and the shrieks
of the wounded and the reserved attitude of
the dead, finishing up with the siege of Brisbane
and the brutal murder of Sir Samuel Griffith.
But, unhappily, after constructing an imaginary
shearer and an imaginary rebellion, not one of
the capitalist organs had courage enough to
finish the story ; they dropped the whole yarn
when it was in danger of becoming interesting
for the first time, and let all their past asser-
tions slide. Strangely enough, too, nobody
seems surprised at this dismal breaking
off probably because everybody is used
to it. In recognised fiction, when the hero
leaps from a eliff 0000 feet high, he has got to
go right on to the bottom and be smashed,
but iu alleged fact, as it is dished up by the
S.M. Herald and the Courier, he stops short
in the air when he is half-way down, and walks
back, or else he gets lost somewhere on the way
and neither falls nor stops falling—in fact,
nothing more is said about him. This sort of
thing may be interesting, but it is very abrupt
and patchy. Even the Charge of the Light
Brigade wouldn’t have amounted to much if the
famous brigade had neither got to its destina-
tion nor come back, nor survived, nor been
killed, nor anything else—if it had simply
started at a furious gallop, in fact, and then
evaporated, and never been heard of again.
And in like manner, if the history of the
Franco-German campaign broke off in the
middle of the carnage at Gravelotte, and tailed
away unaccountably into a report of an hospital
meeting, and didn’t even mention where either
of the combatants got to, or if they got any-
where, it would probably be regarded as an
eminently unsatisfactory story. Yet the pre-
sent alleged industrial “rising” ends in pre-
cisely that fashion, and so did the last rising,
and the rising before it ; and the next one will
freeze up abjectly in like manner. And when
each supposed “disturbance” conies on the
organs of respectability call on the State to take
a lesson by the last “ disturbance,” quite re-
gardless of the fact that the last disturbance is
still unfinished, for just as the combatants were
rushing at each other with shrieks of awful
ferocity they both vanished somehow, and left
not even a hair behind them. It is ever thus,
and it gets monotonous. One complete dog-
fight would be worth more than six of these
miserable upheavals, which always get stuck
and won’t heave one solitary inch even in the
interest of “spechul edishuns.”
o
The Fathers of the Church.
Leo XIII, the representative of St. Peter,
has entered into a species of unwritten treaty
with the German Emperor, according to which
the Head of the Church is to lend his assistance
for the suppression of socialism, and as a step in
this direction he is going to issue an encyclical
letter pointing out to all Catholics the necessity
of obedience to any kind of Government that
may chance to be over them. The letter will,
no doubt, come in handy, for the first business
of every Government is to look after the interest
of the landlord and the capitalist; and the
socialist, having no sympathies with either of
these authorities, is bound to be against the
Government, whatever it may be; and it is
better for Leo to prop up a Protestant emperor,
or a Moslem, or a Mormon, or an affluent canni-
bal, than to see a party get uppermost that
wants all men to be free and equal. For the
Pope has everything to lose by socialism, and
when it conies along in earnest the last Head of
the Church may have to go looking for prawns
in Galilee, just as the first Head of the Church
did a good while ago. There are a good many
hundred rooms—or a good many thousand—in
the Vatican, and a good many miles of priceless
pictures and statues, and there is about the
largest library in the world, mostly made up by
hard embezzlement and confiscation ; and there
are several tons of images in gold and silver, and
enough precious stones to fill several good sized
coal-scuttles, and a collection of curiosities that
are worth as much as all the railways in New
South Wales and a lot over. And in the midst
of these there wanders around a rheumatic
patriarch with the biggest income on earth who
is no use to anybody except himself, and who is
very little use to himself either—the same old
shuffling, broken-down spectre that curses Irish
Nationalism, and German Socialism, and
Spanish Republicanism, and who piles his great
spavined anathema on everything that bears any
semblance to human progress. And along with
it goes the anathema of the Archbishop of Canter-
bury, and the Presbyterian Assembly, and the
Greek Patriarch, and the Sheik-ul-Islam, for on
the subject of Socialism the Church is exceed-
ingly unanimous, and it hangs on by its teeth
and its hair to the old cause of the
capitalist who gives about one-eight per
cent, of his plunder to the Lord; also the
principal Brahmin and the head Buddhist are to
be found on the same side, and the boss Mormon,
and the snake-charmer, and the rain-maker,
and the Baptist, and the Obeah-man, and the
Fetish-man, and every other kind of priest that
was ever invented. The only sign of cohcsiveness
among all these creeds arises out of their unani-
mous desire to squash that nefarious doctrine
which asserts that there should be no more
landlords and no more capitalists, and when the
danger grows more imminent at least three-
fourths of them will be prepared to sink all
their old differences and go the whole sacred
hog in the interests of Cash. There are as
many varieties of plutocrats as there are of
creeds and apostles, but they never fail to hang
together. The fashionable pastor grovels to the
principal millionaire in his congregation, and
the mollah of Tunis smoothes the road to
Heaven for the believer who owns a jug-full of
battered copper coinage, and Pope Leo frater-
nises with the German Emperor, and the other
kind of Pope—the greasy pastor of some
obscure Russian village, the Pope who lives in
a hovel instead of a palace—fraternises with the
local policeman, who is the only kind of em-
peror of his acquaintance. And the one thing
that all the different kinds of Popes are sur-
prised about is the irreligious tendency of
modern Socialism. Nearly every church on
earth has thrown out the socialist and damned
him, both before and after they threw him out,
and now they damn him again because he is out
and is likely to remain there.

Some Good Jokes.
A Queensland contractor—let us call him
Wiggle —recently secured a Divisional Board
contract of £9OO, for clearing a road. His
bondsman was (say) Fizzle, of Fizzle and Co.,
who happened to be also a member of the
contract-letting Divisional Board. Fizzle paid
the necessary deposit on Wiggle’s contract.
Fizzle and Co. honoured Wiggle’s cheques,
“ stuck to ” Wiggle for rations, and received
“ progress payments ” on his account from the
Board, Wiggle never handling any of the
Board’s money. The oilier clay Wiggle
appeared as defendant in a Petty Debts Court,
the joint plaintiffs being three labourers,
who sued him for Col 3s. Sd., wages
due. Wiggle nobly admitted his in-
debtedness. That was his little joke. A
telegram was exhibited from the contract-
letting Divisional Board’s clerk, stating that
the balance due to Wiggle -■£3oo -had been
paid to Fizzle and Co. a week before. W iggle,
after thinking awhile, announced that Fizzle
and Co. would probably advance him the
amount of claim on his plant, which could be
then seen from the courthouse in Fizzle and
Co.’s yard. Alternately, he was of opinion
that the plant would realise £l5O at auction.
The Bench thereupon gave a verdict for
plaintiff's ; in default of sufficient levy, one
mouth’s imprisonment. That was the joke
magisterial. When the police tried to levy on
Wiggle’s plant, Fizzle and Co. exhibited
a bill of sale protecting it. That was
the joke capitalistic. The execution order
was returned nulla bona, and W ig-
gle formally bankrupted. The same after-
noon, his plant was auctioned by Fizzle and
Co. “to redeem their bill-of-sale,” and the
greater part of it was knocked down to Fizzle.
That was the third and last joke. The trans-
action shows glaringly the urgent need of a
Lien for Wages Act, to protect workmen from
the combination frauds of bogus contractors and
capitalistic conspirators. Premier Griffith
has more than once attempted to induce the
Queensland Parliament to pass such a measure,
but his intentions have always been frustrated
by that ancient and loyal ally of capitalistic
sharks, the Upper House. If those swindled
Queensland labourers —there were more sum-
monses in anticipation, to the extent of £2O0 —-
were to loot Fizzle and Co.’s premises, the
horror of the righteously-indignant capitalists
and their Press would know no bounds. “ Pro-
putty ” would emit a shriek and call on the
Government for gatling-guns and paid swaddles
to shoot down the “ rebels.” But, because one
of their number has imposed starvation upon
and robbed a crowd of common labourers, capi-
talists merely laugh and refer to it as “ smart
business capacity.” And the law is satisfied.
For, has not Wiggle (jot a month's imprison-
ment —for a £250 scoop ?
Sydney Daily Telegraph (which apparently
wants to help its “ uncle ”) weeps because
dunning creditors cannot by law obtain a
garnishee order on a debtor’s salary when the
debtor is a Civil Servant: —
Why a distinction should be drawn in this respect
between those in the employ ot private firms or indivi-
duals, and those in the service of the State, it is hard to
understand.
The Bulletin also thinks no distinctions of
this kind should be drawn, and for that reason
it asks :—Why should a garnishee order lie
obtainable by duns on any person's salary ? If
a debtor has nothing to live on but his wages,
is it just for the State to enable a creditor to
rob him of his only means of subsistence V
Tradesmen ought to, and generally do, know
the exact risk they are running when they coax
or allow people who are on wages only to
patronise them “on credit.” The abolition of
all legal process for the recovery of debts would,
and will one of these days, cure a big social
cancer. The N.S. W. Civil Service non-garnishee
system sets an excellent example.
The wife of a San Francisco editor lately fell
in love with his friend, a business man, and he
with her. They did not abuse his confidence,
they held no clandestine meetings, simply went
and told him the truth ; he consented to a
divorce, they were married, and he attended
the wedding. The entire affair was conducted
without publicity, without disturbing the
friendly relations existing between the trio.
Those who believe in the inviolability of the
marriage tie will call such proceedings immoral,
but they are, broadly-speaking, as moral as any
arrangements dealing with the relation of the
sexes can be. The business man might have
taken advantage of his friend’s confidence, the
wife betrayed her husband’s honour, the hus-
band killed one or both to vindicate his man-
hood. Straightforwardness and a logical marriage-
law rendered dishonour and death unnecessary.
Blink it as we may, that ’Frisco divorce and re-
marriage show us the goal to which the world is
drifting—the goal (of absolute freedom of con-
tract) towards which civilised mankind began to
drift when it consented to the first divorce.
The S.M. Herald has thrown off its mask, and
has announced itself as the blind slave of the
federated capitalists, and their colleagues in
the present conspiracy to yoke in all protesting
labour. It bewails the alleged “concessions”
made to the dockers by the London Shipping
Federation, as “likely to do more harm than
good,” and accentuates its censure thus (italics
ours): —
This is true, more particularly ot that one in which the
shipowners have cancelled the clause in the Federation’s
ticket which declares that preference shall be given to
non-uniotiists The resolution to give pre-
ference to free labour had been adopted in not unreason-
able retaliation . . and the abandonment of it . . .
will very probably result in preparing “a rod for” the
Federation’s “ own back.” For experience has shown
everywhere . . . that placing free labour and
unionists on exactly an equal platform works entirely
into the hands of the unionists . . . sooner or later
must compel the free labourers to pass over to the ranks of
the union.
The Herald thus absolutely repudiates that
flaunted thing which it had formerly held up as
the sacred backbone of the employers’ creed—
“ freedom of contract.” It now, as shown
above, distinctly advocates preference to black-
legs. Yet it denounces unionists for daring to
agree with it in i-ejecting “ freedom of contract,”
thus showing that the whole question is con-
sidered by the Herald and its colleague em-
ployers as one of personal war, to be fought out
under the ethics of war only. It is an open
secret that the shipowners were so dissatisfied
with the Herald’s attitude in the big strike
that they threatened commercial vengeance.
The Herald’s present position as set forth
above ought to satisfy them.

One of the most formidable and artfully con-
trived hindrances to the natural development
of the Australian Republican sentiment is the
military and naval enthusiasm which is being
fostered here by Imperialistic officials and their
local conspirators and dupes. The baits are
skilfully laid to tickle the vanity of valorous
and aspiring youth. The haughty scions of
British “nobility,” for instance, are pleased to
condescend to receive and to mix with young
men from the kawlinies, and to permit their
enrolment, under certain disabilities,.as attaches
to British regiments, or British men-o’-war.
The youth of Australia are tempted to make
arms their profession and to look to the Im-
perial service as their only avenue of advance-
ment, thus unconsciously habituating them-
selves to regard England always as first and
Australia a poor second. What a lovely crop
of young anti-Nationalist snobs we shall have
when the Anglo-Australian naval cadet system
is in full blast !

Robert P. Porter, head of the U.S. Census
Office, on the M‘Kineey Tariff: —
We look on the Bill as simply one to foster our indus-
tries, and induce wealth to run in one channel (say), the
U.S.', instead of in another (say), foreign countries. . .
So far as England is concerned, I should call it rather a
Bill to promote the emigration of capitalist producers
and experts to give employment to our labour. Many
Englishmen are already availing themselves of the chance,
and you’ll see plenty others will follow I ll
undertake to say the Republic is to-day miles further
away from Freetrade than England is from a reasonable
tariff on articles of luxury The Republican
party favours the reciprocity that does not injure the
home market. That is Blaine’s platform. The recipro-
city which means Freetrade, or free imports of competing
products, no Republican favours. ... If the Demo-
crats were to attempt to upset the country by opposing
new tariff legislation, they would be eternally smashed in
1892. So far as the M‘Finley Bill is concerned, it is good
for 10 years.
And that is the whole matter in a nutshell.
The British Government has reduced the mini-
mum standard for the army to sft. 3in., and the
old difficulty about finding recruits still
remains, for no matter how fast the standard is
reduced the nation decays still faster. There-
fore the time may come when a robust
individual one yard high will be gladly
enrolled as a Grenadier—in fact, that time
must come according to all existing signs, for
the process of diminution seems to be incurable.
There are plenty of long-drawn-out Britons
still in existence —probably as many as there
ever have been—but the proportion of men
who are unfit for service increases every year.
They are mostly narrow in the chest, and
shaky at the knees, and loose and rickety in
the joints, and otherwise gone to seed, for
Britain is rapidly becoming a collection of
gaunt, unwholesome cities planted in an uncul-
tivated desert, and the men who are reared in
cities are a thin, angular, weary race without
either muscle or endurance. And as for the
agricultural population, it has been wiped out
by landlordism and Freetrade—that is to say,
it survived landlordism, but it could not sur-
vive landlordism and Freetrade combined. And
consequently, what was once the tallest and
most muscular nation in Europe now- passes off
any narrow, consumptive spectre of sft. Sin. as
a soldier, and even he is so lamentably scarce
that probably ere long the test of height will be
abandoned altogether, and the recruiting
authorities will enrol any bow-legged dwarf
who can pass an examination in lifting a
quarter-bag of coals, and who is willing to be
dressed up in a glaring red coat for the better
convenience of anybody who is out shooting at
the empire on which the sun never sets.
It is admitted that one of the men lately con-
victed of murder at Melbourne slew his victim
because the latter, who was <lt facto though not
de jure his wife and for whom lie had an ardent
passion, abandoned him to take up with
another. Suppose the woman had been his
wedded wife and had committed adultery and
mocked him as she passed with her man, would
not such an application of provocation to the
primal and ruling passion of the human race
have given him a claim for mercy ? Un-
doubtedly, for such claims have been recognised
a thousand times. Is then hypocrisy still so
strong that because no priestly mummery of
words sanctified their union, a man driven to
frenzy by the most exquisite and mental tortures
is to be butchered in cold blood by the State
—in what must be an utterly vain attempt
to “ deter ” the next man whom a jeering and
heartless woman drives to madness ? The judi-
cial psychology of Anglo-Saxondom is a disgrace
to ‘ ‘ civilisation. ”
♦— —
The cable states that “the colonisation com-
mittee has lately been inquiring into the severe
distress existing in some of the Highland dis-
tricts in Scotland, and has now submitted a
report recommending that facilities for emigra-
tion should be offered in the distressed districts.”
It is the same old remedy once more—the same
eternal “move on”—the same weary policy of
shifting the responsibility and passing on the
burden. Only one-fifth of Scotland is culti-
vated, and still the agricultural population has
to be shunted, because the landlords have
declared that the other four-fifths shall remain
a wilderness and be used for the production of
deer and grouse, which sell better than human
beings. The average Highlander is tough and
uneatable ; also, he is devoid of gravy, and so
his landlord doesn’t want him. Besides, an
idiotic Government has made it a close season
for Highlanders all the year round, and is
thereby leading to the rapid extinction of the
nation. No doubt if the British sportsman
were allowed to go out on the moors and bag a
M‘Donald or a MTavish the sport would be
much better than shooting a miserable bird or a
shivering quadruped, and under these circum-
stances every effort would be made to preserve
the race. The same system would apply to the
bucolic population in England, and though
their value for sporting purposes would pro-
bably be limited, it would at least be sufficient
to save them from extinction. Some philan-
thropic Tory landlord would do well to look
into this idea. It is a recognised axiom that
nobody has any right to exist in any place
whatsoever unless his presence is remunerative
to his landlord, and evidently the only way to
preserve the country population of Britain is to
make them profitable as game, seeing that they
are not profitable as ordinary inhabitants.

A State Fraud.
The Bulletin withdraws its anathema of last
week, under the above heading, on the N.S.W.
Minister for Public Instruction, Mr. Carru-
thers, and piles it right on to the State and an
insensate Act of Parliament, interpreted and
administered by the Civil Service Board. The
facts relating to the New South Wales system
of Civil Service superannuation—a fraudulent
insurance fund—are correct as stated and apply
to all departments, though its unjust incidence
in regard to females is more apparent in the
Department of Public Instruction than in most
• other branches of the service. Official salaries
are forcibly docked to the extent of 4 per cent,
per annum under an Act passed in 1884. When
an officer reaches the age of 60 years, he or she
may retire upon a pension paid out of the fund
thus provided, which fund is administered by
the Civil Service Board, and belongs properly
to the Colonial Secretary’s Department. The
pension may possibly reach the dimensions of
an amount equal to two-thirds of the salary last
received, but only in the case of an officer who
first of all pays a lump sum, or promises to pay
by instalments such a sum, as would be
equivalent to 4 per cent, on the total of
salaries received by him or her from
the time of joining the service, the en-
forced payments under the Act only starting
from 1884. As a rule, however, the retiring
officer elects to take his or her chance of dying
within a year or two, and does not choose to
pay the amount of “ back dues,” so that the
retiring allowance is usually a small matter,
amounting to half, or less than half, an annual
salary. If any officer leaves the department
prior to attaining 60 years, the fund swallows
up all past payments ; if he or she remain in
the department after attaining 60 years and
die, the State still sticks to its hoarded levies.
There is, however, a pretence at restitution in
the cases of heirs left “ absolutely destitute.”
But the Civil Service Board, as already stated,
interprets the Act, and decides what is and
what is not “ absolute destitution.” It has
been explained that Mr. Carruthers has abso-
lutely nothing to do with the fund, and we
understand that he feels specially hurt in con-
nection with the case of the late Mrs. Lockett
(with which we last week merely illustrated the
system) because he strenuously endeavoured to
have something done to aid the daughters of
the deceased lady. The Civil Service Board,
however, felt it to be their duty not to
exempt this case from the ordinary applica-
tion of the Act, their reason, so far as
we can understand it, being that they
could not conscientiously regard the young
ladies as being “ absolutely destitute,”
they being over the age of 16 years and able to
eaiTi their own living. Equity strongly demands
that officers retiring from the service before
they reach the age of 60 years, should be repaid
the amount which the State has forcibly de-
ducted from their contract wages, and, in the
case of officers dying in the service, their legal
heirs should benefit to that extent. The in-
justice falls with special cruelty upon females
marrying out of, or dying in, the service. The
State simply forces on all its officers an Insur-
ance discipline that is no Insurance at all. The
system is a burden hated by all officers as a
stand-and-deliver robbery under the guise of
philanthropy. An Amending Act is urgently
needed, either making the contributing to this
bogus insurance fund purely optional, or pro-
viding for refunds of impounded payments as
outlined above. Such a measure can only be
introduced by the Premier or the Colonial
Secretary. Here is a chance for Parkes to
make himself sweet with the Civil Service vote
before the next general elections.
The latest report of the London Dock Labourers’
Union throws another interesting side-light on
the much-vaunted decline of British pauperism
under the beneficent influence of Freetrade.
The Union now consists of 45,000 members,
and in December last no less than 30,000 of
these were and had been for some time out of
work. Every one of these 30,000 men were
paupers except for the one circumstance that
the State gave them no relief—they were
paupers barring the fact that the advantages of
pauperism were denied them, and consequently
they appeared in -none of the Government or
parochial returns—in fact, they were tacitly
reckoned as citizens in affluent circumstances.
Including their wives and families they totalled
probably 100,000 destitute - persons in one
branch of industry alone, or an addition in one
single trade anil in one single town, of ten per
cent to the aggregate pauperism of the kingdom.
And their destitution was as utter and complete
as destitution well could be. They lived, and
are mostly still living, on the miserable dole
which the Union was able to scrape up from the
contributions of the 15,000 men who were still
employed—or, in other words, each working
member, 'out of his maximum income of sixpence
an hour, was supposed to support two other
members and their families besides himself and
his family. And at last, when the tremendous
strain became unendurable it was seriously
debated whether this aggregate of about 100,000
human beings should not throw themselves
unanimously upon the poor law, and swarm
bodily into the workhouse, supposing—which is
eminently improbable—that there was room for
even 100 of them, let alone 100,000, in that
receptacle for rags and misery. The scheme
was abandoned by reason of its obvious im-
practicability, and consequently the pauper re-
turns of the prosperous British Isles escaped a
very serious inflation, but the reality is there
just the same. Pauperism decreases in England
because thousands and hundreds of thousands
of poor are supported by the trades-unions
instead of by public taxation, but when one
solitary union in one seaport, maintains 100,000
unemployed out of its funds alone, and when to
this are added the innumerable other unions of
London, and of the rest of the British cities,
the vast mass of the poor who belong to no
union, and the great army of acknowledged
paupers, the total passes comprehension.
Mr. Edmunds, M.L.A., intends, when New
South Wales Parliament meets, to move for all
papers, declarations, &c., re fhe case of one
Henry Myers, who, on 10th September last,
was sentenced to seven years’ penal servitude,
he having been convicted of having, on 3rd
June, stabbed his wife, Mary Myers, in the
breast with a pocket-knife. Two witnesses,
whose evidence assisted to convict him, have
since, it is stated, made statutory declarations
to the effect that they and Mary Myers
committed perjury, and that the woman
stabbed herself in order to bring trouble on her
husband, and bribed them to bear false witness.
The two female witnesses already alluded to
should be gaoled for perjury in any case. If
these witnesses spoke truth at the trial, they
have perjured themselves in the statutory
declarations. If they speak truly in the statu-
tory declarations, then they perjured them-
selves at the trial. What does Attorney-
General Simpson think about it ?

An illustration of the gross injustice and un-
representative results of plural voting occurred
at the recent municipal elections at Mary-
borough (Q.) The voting in this particular in-
stance put in one J. M. Stafford with 544
votes, the scoring record further placing as
they here follow 2, J. T. Murray, 509 ;3,
Mitchell, 502 ; 4, John Norman, 434 ; 5,
Thos. Long, 234. The municipal electoral sys-
tem of Queensland enables the scrutineers after-
wards to analyse the voting, and that sort of
scrutiny showed that more ratepayers had re-
corded votes for Norman, who was fourth, and
only polled 434, than for Stafford, who was
returned, on 544 votes. Stafford’s majority
was made up of about a gross of plural votes,
or dummies, and he now sits as the aldermanic
representative of bricks and mortar and beer-
engines ; while Norman, the man elected by
human beings, is out of the running. The in-
cidence of plural voting is ten times more in-
jurious in Parliamentary polls than in municipal
elections. Which is why the one-man-one vote
is the first step towards the achievement by the
common unpropertied people of a truly free and
full franchise, and the downfall of usurping
dominances.
That portion of The Bulletin which includes
our leading article was at press during the
time Sir George Grey was delivering his
great speech in the Federal Convention, and a
distinct exception from the sweeping condem-
nation of our remarks in that article must be
now made in favour of the noble old Maori-
lander’s attitude to States-rights and the Im-
perial Connection. Differing, as we venture to
do, from Sir George in our . views of the im-
portance of the Empire to these provinces, we
still welcome his utterances as the most notable,
the most admirable in temper and spirit, the
most A ustralian, of those yet enunciated on the
Federal Question either in Parliament or in the
Convention. From the position he therein
defined as the true one to be occupied hv the
Federated States of Australasia it would be but
a step to the Federated Republic of Australia.
Without stress and without strain the Republic
would naturally arise from the Federation—an
Elective Governor-General is but one remove
from an Elective President! The one logical
blot in Sir George’s speech was that, while
he claims for the Federal Government a para-
mount authority and denies the free and sove-
reign statehood of the several states, lie, not-
withstanding, would assure to each individual
state supremacy in the matter of its own
Constitution. Now, an integral element
in a State Constitution is the right to
surrender to the Federal authority certain
State powers. The right of saying which
powers shall be surrendered and which re-
tained is, says Sir George, not to be with
drawn from the individual States. But the act
of selection is itself an assertion of supremacy.
Here, then, Sir George is inconsistent. In one
other respect he is inconsistent. No—we will
correct ourselves : not so much inconsistent as
magnanimous. The Empire he eulogises as the
nurse of freedom and the mother of enterprise
is the same Empire which, when he was guilty
of deeds of far-sighted statesmanship and unique
liberality, condemned him as a “ dangerous
man,” and to this very hour, if we test Imperial
action by its own standards, insults and out-
rages him. Sir George, whose heart, so far as
the public has been able to discover, has never
thrilled to one sordid impulse, is a “ dangerous
man ” because he fought Power, Caste, and
Officialdom. But it is with forces that are in-
capable of aught but revenge, that the Nestor
of Australasia desires us to retain our alliance !
Grey is betrayed by his very greatness.
Like Wagga, the West Coast of JST.Z. has
gained an evil pre-eminence in murders. This is
ascribed, by a local journal, to insanity caused by
the excessive use of doctored tea.
Mr. Charles Arthur Moresby Billyard, of
Sydney, who is about to marry a wealthy Tas-
manian lady named Leake, gives notice of his
intention to change bis name to Leake, in accord-
ance with the will of the testator from whom the
lady derives her fortune. Thus Charles in marry-
ing loses his maiden name.
According to the Sydney Workman, the
inmates of the local Home for Fallen Women
have amusements about twice a week “in the
shape of ‘ musical chairs ’ and ‘ blindman’s-buff ’
after tea.” The director “is the only gentleman
present.” We further read that of the 27 inmates
fully five are pianists, one of whom got honors in
the Royal College of Music.

“Colleen Bawn” ran very smoothly at
Sydney Her Majesty’s on first night to a good
house, but, probably, the most lasting impression
conveyed by it to the Australian mind will be the
remarkable sameness of Irish scenery. Following
another Hibernian play, folks in front mixed up
appellations after the fashion of Irish stew and
talked freely between acts of Arrah Bawn, Myles
the Post, and Danny Feeney. As the Colleen, a
character that is pulled by one string only, M aggie
Moore does not obtain the all-round show she had
with Arrah, and her apparent failure on compari-
son is due simply to the weakness of the one
character made more manifest by its following so
closely on the other. The Myles-na-Coppaleen of
Jack Sweeney is a good rough-and-ready perform-
ance, butwantingin theslynessandthe physicaland
mental light-heelednessthat isMyles’characteristic
Harry Jewett’s Danny Mann is very ably handled
and to be excelled only by that of one built for the
part, cradled in it and schooled in all its traditions.
The Ann Chute of Roland Watts-Phillips is, per-
haps, the worst thing she has ever given us, her
brogue doesn’t fit and she lacks the easy dash,
abandon and careless grace necessary for Ann’s in-
terpretation. By the way, the Colleen Ruadh is
usually played with an auburn wig. Arthur
Greenaway also lacked levity—in fact, the ten-
dency of the whole show is towards ponderosity.
The Hardress Cregan of J. W. Hazlitt is just
supportable, the Father Tom of Stirling Whyte,
safe, the Corrigan of Frank Harcourt best in re-
pose, and the Mrs. Cregan of Mabel Tracey
suggestive of the high heels and pearl-grey tights
of pantomime. When we say that “Colleen
Bawn ” will probably run until it is turned off,
we are not speaking rashly, for George Rignold,
who lias retired for a well-earned spell, seriously
worsted in his encounter with the Irish language,
has so many good things in store that he doesn’t
know what to do first.

“ Master and Man” has fairly caught on
at Sydney Royal, despite the fact that a good
deal of tommyrot is sandwiched in with stuff that
might be more fitly mated. For instance, folks
are bored for about ten minutes by the ambitious
Jack Walton, described as “ a man of brains and
education,” and his wife, with some drivel con-
cerning Farls, Farlesses and Earlets, after the
fashion of Johnny Sheridan’s “He’ll be a count
and I’ll be a counter,” that is positively depres-
sing. The baby—not Lohr’s heiress, it seems—
takes kindly to stage-business, but, flushed with
success, has lately dropped into a Snazelley
fashion of gagging that is likely to mar its
future usefulness. Yet the audience seem to like
its inconsequential remarks, and some night we
expect to see their appreciation take the practical
shape of feeding-bottles and soothing syrup. This
idea is suggested by a rumour that the “gods” have
serious thoughts of visiting the abbatoirs in quest
of liver for Beelzebub, who is getting a trifle podgy
for active business. It is proposed to send a re-
quisition behind requesting Albert Norman to
refrain from saying “ Ameriker,” and someone
with a genius for figures has calculated that the
word “ damn it occurs seven times in each act
is the best laughter-getting line in the play.
Arthur Lawrence is rapidly losing the adiposity
which he is so proud under the weight of
Logan’s hump, but everything points to a pros-
perous season while there is a shred of him left.
Our illustrations of the show on another page are
calculated to give folks who “ never visit the
theatre on principle, my dear,” a good idea of
what it is like. Premier Parkes has invited the
Federal Convention to the Royal on Saturday
next.

“ The Jilt,” preceded on the last evening
by “Honour Bound,” was replaced at Sydney
Criterion by “ School ” on Tuesday evening. Its
chief feature was the return of George Anson and
Emma Temple and the induction of Miss Romer
as the instructress into the goloshes vacated by
Mrs. Bolton. All the other parts are filled as on
the prior occasion, and (at the time of writing we
hadn’t seen the show) probably in the same good,
old style. Maggie Moore will make her first
appearance at this house in “The Schoolmistress,”
by Pinero, at Easter.

At Sydney Garrick the tuneful opera of
“ Mignon,” by Ambroise Thomas, Annis Monta-
gue’s instructor, is excellently staged, and on the
whole, capably dealt with. The opera is at all times
well worth hearing, simply on its own merits,
and apparently could hold the stage during the
rest of the season. Annis Montague, in the name-
part, on first night was in good voice and made
the most of evei’y opportunity, and the new
singer, Edith Moore (a pupil of Lucy Chambers),
also a soprano, as Filina, sang with a finish and
ease not often exhibited by a debutante. Charles
Turner’s cold is on the mend, and he was all right
as Wilhelm Meister, while Warwick Gainor’s
Lotario, with quieter music than he has lately
handled, was, perhaps, the best thing he has yet
shown us. Cicely Staunton, as Frederick, made
a small hit, and her “Here am I in Beauty’s
Room ” got a big call. Percy Shannon played
Laertes, but was chiefly remarkable for his mou-
stache, which would have done credit to Buffalo
Bill and gladdened the heart of any bottle-washer.
Houses are keeping up. “Fra Diavolo” is an-
nounced for Saturday, and “Faust,” “ Lucia di
Lammermoor,” and “Martha,” follow at brief
intervals. Turner has also two new operas, Van
Brnhl’s “ Golden Cross,” and Goldmark’s “ Queen
of Sheba,” in reserve.

down Sydney harbour on Sunday last. She had a
big cargo in the afternoon, and at night was
crowded from stem to stern though there was lots
of room on deck. Harry Rickards, who sang in
the evening, was rapturously encored (he appears
again next Sunday afternoon), and Arthur Gordon
made a hit with the “ Dream of Eugene Aram,”
which, we need hardly say, is one of the finest
things for recitation ever written.

At Wild America last Saturday Dr. Carver
smashed up 201 balls in 4min. 43sec., according to
the tally of a committee of journalists, and ten
just-caught wild bullocks were ridden in the arena
at one time by cowboys, Indians, Mexicans and
Australians. As one steer had cleared the camp
on the previous evening, knocking down tepes
and hoisting up benches, things were a bit lively.
Next week the Doctor smashes 500 balls.

The Dual Bathing Club continues to boom
along at Sydney Natatorium where the pellucidity
of the waters is only excelled by the snowy white-

feminine investigation.
“ Devil Caresfoot,” a comedy recently
tried in Brisbane with apparent success, was-re-
ceived with a respectful yawn at Melbourne Bijou
on Saturday night. There is little action and no
humour in the story, and all parties concerned
are more or less objectionable, with the exception
of a young man in knickerbockers who goes away
at the end of the first act and doesn’t return until
the audience is dropping into a gentle doze. Dur-
ing the long absence of this estimable but colour-
less young person his girl is worried and tricked
into marrying a libertine, on the understanding
that he is about to die and will relinquish all con-
nubial rights in return for the privilege of making
over his estates to his bride’s father. The delicate
maiden puts these private conditions on half a
sheet of paper, which the “ Devil ” duly signs, and
after the marriage ceremony she retires to her
own apartments and set ks comfort in the supposi-
tion that her liege lord is dying as fast as possible.
Whereupon the good young man turns up
with scorn in one eye and disgust in
the other, and curses her before the wedded
virgin has time to explain that the other
fellow is an unimportant circumstance, who will
shortly become food for worms. Then the vir-
tuous lover clears out, and the moribund bride-
groom comes sneaking in with a view to breaking
his solemn agreement, to which end he begins
chasing his lawful spouse round the sofa. How-
ever, the lady’s father intervenes at this interest-
ing stage, because he had a vague suspicion that
his son-in-law might crown a career of villainy by
attempting to embrace his own wife. The young
man also returns once more, though it is quite
evident that he has no business there, and enjoys
the satisfaction of seeing the “Devil” roll dead
from his chair. The excitement of pursuing Mrs.
Caresfoot on their wedding night has been too
much for the enfeebled reprobate. Everybody
cries “Dead!” and the curtain falls, leaving
a tired congregation to wonder whether
there will be an inquest on the body
and spicy details in the newspapers, or
whether the affair will be discreetly covered
up like the death of Sculptor Boehm. A four-act
play which is at once dull, unpleasant, and devoid
of moral purpose, will scarcely do much good for
the Bijou exchequer. Nor is Miss Janet Achurch
likely to increase her number of admirers by ap-
pearing in the tedious, unsympathetic character
of Angela Caresfoot. She is frequently ungrace-
ful in gait and gesture, harsh in utterance, and
bluestockmgy in style. Her acting throughout
is powerful rather than pleasing, save when she
moves the house to enthusiasm by a very womanly
cling to her departing lover. Charrington’s
elaborated and Irvingesque performance of the
name-part has a certain air of being stronger than
it is, and his make-up strikes the eye. Herbert
Flemming is nice as usual, especially about the
stockings, and the others have few opportunities
to seem of much account. Special exception may
be taken to a hat worn by Miss Lillie Bryer, who
picks up a hand-glass and positively expresses ad-
miration for this hideous head-gear. “ Devil
Caresfoot ” is elegantly staged, and may last for
a second week. On the other hand it may not.

At the Opera House there was only a
moderate attendance for the opening night of
“Kindred Souls,” a show which suggests a lemon-
squash spiced with cayenne pepper. A company
including Snazelle, Gourlay, John Forde, Wallace,
Hodson, Fanny Liddiard, Aggie Kelton, and
others, cannot fail to give some dignity to this
series of marital complications, and the fooling
has at least a polish on it. Nevertheless “Kindred
Souls ” is no more than a glorified music-hall farce,
and if the people engaged were to come on
separately and give “ turns ” they would go a good
deal further and probably fare no worse.

“The Fortune of War,” as adapted from
the French and produced for the first time at
Melbourne Royal, is a gorgeous military pano-
rama appealing to an old-fashioned sense of rever-
ence for national flags. The story, which goes
back to the gory times of Buonaparte, tells how
two French soldiers in particular, and the army
in general, are dying for love of a cantinibre’s
daughter, a sweet young creature who travels
round with the troops and contrives to remain
innocent all the while. The eantinierc promises
her girl to the suitor who gets his promotion
first, and then they all tear away and fire squibs
at the Austrians until it appears that one of the
rivals has saved the Flag. Consequently the
Commander-in-Chief promotes this hero and puts
him in charge of the Flag, and then the fair bone
of contention chooses the other soldier as a
matter of course. Under these circumstances
the promoted person naturally curses the
sex, gets drunk, and wants to fight, so
the Commander-in-Chief deprives him of his
Flag, and hands it over to the young woman's
other mash. Some more battle occurs after this,
and the Austrians are on the verge of getting the
Flag when it is providentially grabbed by the
cantiniere’s daughter, who puts it under her shawl
and thanks Heaven that France has still got its
stupid bit of bunting. But the other lover (who
has gone over to the Austrians in the meantime)
comes along and catches the girl. They struggle
together until the maiden inadvertently discloses
the precious Flag to view. The sight of this
sacred emblem is too much for the man who has
taken up with the enemy, and he repents on the
spot. Then the Austrian commander clanks on
•and wants the Flag from the girl, and when she
says she hasn’t got it they stick her up against a
cardboard cross and shoot at her. But the re-
pentant warrior gets in the lino of fire
and dies in place of the girl, after which
the French Army swoops upon the scene,
and the maiden produces the Flag, and it is
unfurled amidst demonstrations of joy. The
Lord only knows what would have happened if
the Austrians had got hold of that flag, because
France had no money to waste upon a new one at
the time. Such human interest as the drama con-
tains is confined to the three people who mono-
polise the Flag, but the scenery and opposing
armies are laid on regardless of expense and may
keep “The Fortune of War” going for awhile.
The violence with which several warriors tumble
down a ravine after being slain by fireworks is
thoroughly inspiring, and quite worth the money
charged for admittance. Charles Cartwright is
vigorous and full of dramatic effect as the soldier
who goes wrong and repents, albeit his monotone,
so appropriate in the part of Cyrus Blenkarn,
is now rather wearisome. Lawrence Cautley
plays the successful lover in an inoffen-
sive fashion, whilst Sass, Harold Rus-
sell, Oily Deering and a lot of other capable
people contrive to look more or less heroic in
regimentals. The comic element, as represented
by Greville and George Walton, is weak and
washy, but the supers seem pretty bloodthirsty,
considering how little they get for keeping up
their courage. There are but two female charac-
ters. Miss Jenny Watt-Tanner represents the
elderly eantinierc in the garb of everyday life,
which seems against all stage tradition, and Miss
Olga Nethersole undertakes the impossible r6le of
the artless daughter in an ultra-emotional manner.

At the Princess’, where they are running
“The Gondoliers ” for another week to big
business, the most noticeable feature is an im-
provement in the singing of Ida Osborne, who
now finishes “When a Merry Maiden Marries ”

ever, is getting worn and ragged last few
weeks. “ Pepita ”on Saturday.

“ The Miner’s Right,” which certainly im-

full of things that may happen to a man within

Wybert Reeve, who shortly takes over this
theatre from the “phirm,” is now in Melbournein
search of attractive novelties for the coming
season. By the way, a tremendous dust-storm
last Saturday evening so darkened the auditorium
that an alarm of fire was raised, and, in the
general stampede, a man’s leg was broken. Quiet
eventually restored, the performance was con-
tinued, George Rignold was badly wanted, how-
ever, to allay the panic by singing “Rule
Britannia.”

They are getting played-out in London, for “Raven's-

It seems to be with the actresses nowadays as with the

Alfred Oellier, after submitting his new comic opera to
J. O. Williamson, and without result, has taken the
manuscript back to Londbn, where Nellie Stewart may,
after all, make her first “ home ” appearance in the prin-
cipal character.
William Elton surprised Thespiana by announcing
his Melbourne farewell benefit. Elton is a real loss to
London, for in every impersonation he wraps himself in a
character, and is not a mere comic lecturer like Greville or
Toole. Take his Dr. Cupid, and parts in “ Erminie,”
“ Pepita,” “ Dorothy,” “ Marjorie,” “ The Gondoliers,”
and “ Hands Across the Sea.”
The grand hit in the “Miner’s Right,” Melbourne
Alexandra, is the reference to Eureka Stockade. It re-
mains now for a dramatist to make this the centre of a
whole piece, boldly introducing Lalor and Co., and the
Australian flag. Give ’em the fight, and glorious triumph
of the Red Lobsters, with the policeman swarming up the
pole, and tearing down the Southern Cross flag before
jumping on it.
A London critic writes on the advance of the stage from
“Formosa” to “The Dancing Girl,” for, when “Formosa”
came out, mighty was the howl. But just compare it
with the “ Dancing Girl,” which is high art. Fish, fish,
how art thou fleshifled ! France conquers, and they will
stand “ Hero and Leander.”
One Ike Elwell, well-known as a circus clown in Eng"

A good yarn is told about a lengthy performance of
“ Monte Cristo ” at one of the London theatres, about
20 years ago. The show 7 had dragged on until 1 a.m., when
George Belmore was interrupted in the middle of a long
soliloquy, by the enquiry “ Shall you be long, sir?” from
a polite sufferer in the pit.
John Brunton will be scenic artist at Melbourne Royal

As a young man, the late Cardinal Newman actually
composed a comic opera. It couldn’t have been very
comic. True piety chiefly consists in lack of humour.
One of the latest London sensations was the pan"
tomime of “ Beauty and the Beast ” at Drury Lane. Lady
Dunlo, as Beauty, wasabig draw, but the real excitement
was the Beast. Miss Vesta Tilley was transformed into that
unhappy animal on the middle of the stage ; she is walk-
ing across it in human shape, and suddenly she turns into
the Beast in full view of the audience, and no one can
guess how the thing is managed. This show has
caused a lot of speculation, but, after all, it isn’t quite
unique. For example, we knew an Australian girl
once who married a beautiful young nobleman from
“ Home,” and he also turned into a beast in full view of
the audience and with very little notice. Moreover, he
remains a beast to this day. The transformation was
brought about by hard drinking, we believe.
“Mrs. Langtry,” says a Yankee writer, “is nothing if
not daring. Even in her playfulness she is often
audacious. Physically, the Jersey Lily is about as near
perfection as women grow. True, she has not the sinuous
grace and ophidian suggestiveness of the Bernhardt; but
her limbs are models of symmetry, and her feet, although
too large, are as shapely as those of the Venus de Medici,

and as soft and pink as a baby’s; hence they look nice
bare in sandals, the obligato style of foot-gear when one
plays the wild and wilful Cleopatra, who had a playful
habit of kicking the bedclothes around in a lively fashion
when Anthony stayed out late at nights. But if there are
parts of the Jersey Lily more beautiful than others, they
are her shoulders* They are—and I speak from autopti-
cal experience—sublimely splendid, especially when
viewed together with the arms, for these are not only
finely shaped, but they make junction with the shoulders
in the highest style of workmanship known to nature.
Now, having these’transcendent merits, it is not, I opine,
at all astonishing that the Jersey Lily, should yearn to
show to the world just how beautiful she is. This is how
she has done it: In one act, her jewelled bodice, which,
of course, is decollete, has very slight shoulder-straps, so
that when her arms are raised the eye gets the full, mag-
nificent sweep across her shoulders and out along the
upper arm. In order to display the symmetry of the
junction of her arms to her trunk, she cuts such long
armholes that the lower edge is on the level with the
bust-line. The effect may be imagined. It is positively
startling, especially when those beautiful arms, large,
full, round, and white, flash angrily in the air as she pours
forth her hot indignation or paints the agony of her
jealousy. But be calm, I beg of you. The Jersey Lily
will ere long bring her Cleopatra, then you may see for
yourselves. What I am waiting to see is whether our
swell girls, ever ready to copy the toilets of actresses,
will dare to adopt Cleopatra armholes.” Whereupon Tub

Texas Jack, while endeavouring to cut down a hung

Mrs. Lyne-Stephens—Marie Louise Duvernay —a British
high-kicking female who made a pile out of her legs some
40 years ago, and then married a wealthy husband, and
who has since thrown her limbs about only in the paths
of calm domestic bliss, has endowed a church at Cam-
bridge to the extent of £lOO,OOO. And now, we presume,
they will hang up her seven-league tights in the taber-
nacle, as a holy, though somewhat abbreviated relic, and it
will be told in after years how the exhibition of her ex-
tremities was indirectly the means of leading many
sinners to repentance, and how her legs were a bright and
shining light generally.
“ Good parts make good actors,” is a favourite saying
on the Point, and, cully, there’s a lot in it. Now look at
Charles Cartwright, who electrifies Sydne3'andMelbourne
in “The Middleman,” and ask his comrade Sass how honest
Cartwright stood in London when he left. Was he
reckoned “ in it ” with Warner and Terriss ? “ Virtue can-
not so inoculate us out of the old stock,” unless a Middle-
man part comes along. See how Willard was kept under
by an infinitely inferior actor, Wilson Barrett, until luck
came in his way. So don’t let your spirits go down,
Brown.
Says the leading Dublin weekly : —“ Henry Irving w; s
lately presented with a sheep (probably the frozen Aus-
tralian, sent by Johnny Toole), and with characteristic
generosity he had it cut up and distributed among the
poor and hungry of the East End of London.” The feast
of the loaves and fishes was nothing to this, for—
Sims Reeves gets more for singing now than when he

well ” business to death.
Santley sang four songs, all chestnuts, “ Maid of
Athens,” “ To Anthea,” “ The Erl King,” and another, at
his first reappearance at the London Monday “Pops.”
Judges say that his voice has less sonorousness than of
yore and that he strains more at his top-notes. Santley
must nave made a fortune, and, as he married one with
his second wife, why doesn’t he sit back and give “ the
boys ” a show ?
According to a Calcutta paper Mrs. Potter is a big draw

Sarah Bernhardt has sailed from Paris with forty-five
large trunks containing 100 costumes valued at £12,000, and
with 30 performers. Capoul and Gamier, however, do not
come with her. She takes no risks, but receives a lump
sum for her two years’ tour in the States, Australia (so ’tis
said), Mexico, Cuba. Then she returns to Europe, and,
without performing, embarks at Liverpool for South
America.
The Sydnay Art Society’s last smoke-concert was very
successful. Messrs. Donovan, Young, Bowler and Craven
sang. Herman Newton violined, and Signor Lardelli
accompanied. Messrs. Spence, Soutar and Mahony did
some lightning sketching.
Pettitt, the dramatist, whose share in “Master and
Man,” judging from style, is not very meritorious,
recently met an old schoolfellow. “By the way,” said
his old friend, “are you any relation to Henry Pettitt,
the dramatist?” “I am he,” replied Pettitt. “Ah, but
I mean the great Henry Pettitt, who writes plays for
Drury Lane.” “Yes,” said Henry, modestly, “that’s
me.” “ Well,” said his friend, with disgust, “ you always
were a liar, Pettitt.” Moral: If you would be a successful
playwright begin intelligent lying early in life.
In Jerome K. Jerome’s “ Stageland,” you miss the
Dresser. Sometimes he button-holes us, or she does, with
magical souvenirs of Brooke, Montgomery, Ellen Mortyn,
Fanny Cathcart, Jefferson ; but the Dresser always has
some hero or heroine that the world never knew, some-
body who could knock your Edmund Kean or Mrs.
Siddons into a cocked hat. We found one whose idol was
the Macbeth of Charley Pope, an actor from America, in
Australia some years ago.
Another commentary on the fact that real life imitates
fiction, rather than fiction real life, is afforded by the
strange lucky hit made by H. A. Jones, in his new play
“ The Dancing Girl,” where the Duke of Guisebury (not
Qoosebury) speculates on what the world would say if he
committed suicide, and almost while the play was being
acted, the Duke of Bedford went and did it, as a splendid
advertisement for Beerbohm-Tree and the Haymarket.
Talking of the runs of pieces, one may glance at the
runs of actors in particular characters. Jefferson leads
with Rip, about 4000 times, and Sothern acted Dundreary,
say, nearly 4000 times, matinees being taken into these
calculations, while Emmett’s “ Fritz ” will foot up to
3500. The other longest lists of performances have in-
cluded Matilda Heron in “Camille,” Toole in “ Ici on
Parle Francais,” Neville in the “ Ticket-of-Leave Man,”
Hawtrey in the “Private Secretary,” Wilson Barrett in
“Claudian,” D. James (Belasco)in “Our Boys,” Raymond
as Col. Mulberry Sellers, Florence in the “Mighty Dollar,”
Minnie Palmer in “My Sweetheart,” Jennie Lee in “ Jo,”
and Clarence Holt in “New Babylon.”
Daughter of music and mirth and song,
With eyes like the light of the morning star,
Whose teeth are like pearls the rooks among
Down where the shrimps and the damp whales are,
Whose hair has borrowed the richest hue
Of the gems in some fathomless cavern sunk ;
The thing that we most do adore in you
Is the way your arms are fixed to your trunk.
Once, in the years that are buried now,
We worshipped for one brief summer day
At the shrine of a maid as fair as thou ;
Then the vision passed, like the mists, away,
And we said, “ This world is an empty show,”
And we swamped our griefs in a tearing drunk,
For, alas ! her arms, as we got to know,
Didn’t join on gracefully to her trunk.
Angel or seraph on airy wings,
This world is not what it seems to be ;
The earth is hollow', and earthly things
Are apt to burst up most dismally,
Yet truth survives; when popes are dust,
And king and cardinal, czar and monk
Are forgotten, they’ll print on a marble bust—
“ Her arms were neatly affixed to her trunk.”
Five loaves and two fishes fed five thousand men
(At least so the Biblicans tell us),
But this little miracle now is eclipsed,
For Irving’s must make them all jealous.
To the poor of East London he gave a rich feast
(Not a man of them could be a glutton),
He divided amongst some two millions of men
One really magnificent mutton.

Tales of Old Sydney.
No. II.— Marie Antoinette’s Fandango.
(FOR THE BULLETIN.)
When we described the formation by the
most distinguished Emancipists of Sydney of the
“Pure Merinoes’ Ball Smash-up Fund”* we
simply sketched the outline of the proceedings,
any allusion to which, for many a long day subse-
quently, bit into the feelings of the First Families
as acutely as the pinch of Colonel Foveaux’s
branding-irons, of old time, tortured his men.
That typical First Family man had, indeed, never
succeeded in scarring the bodies of his proteges as
incurably as the Emancipists, otherwise the
Ancients, wounded the Pure Merinoes’ pride
when they introduced into the exclusive, unadul-
terated, supremely tip-toppy company at Chester-
dale House that characterless young lady, Ruth
Fenwick—No. 119 on the manifest of the female
convict-ship, Lord Warden. Time would cicatrise
the physical injury. For the wound to the spirit
there was no healing.
How the wound came to be inflicted you
have been told in outline. This tale fills in the
picture—which consists of a centre-piece and four
panels.
# * #
Panel the first—Mrs. Kent’s dressing-
room. Present —Mrs. Kent, in all the grace of a
negligeable costume, or, rather, no costume, and
Miss Ruth Fenwick, transport, governess by
repute, pickpocket and light o’ love by profession.
The younger lady speaks.
“ And, ma’am, I’ve mixed with the very best
society— ”
“Yes, yes, I know,” said the lady, impatiently
—“ I know all about that, and that you were in
company with a marquis under very improper
circumstances when you were arrested. But the
point is not your past associations, but can you
act at the ball with your then ones—as if you
belonged to their class ?”
“ If I could pass muster,” rejoined the insulted
girl, bridling disdainfully, “in Bath Pump
Room and assemblies as a gernmen’s—l mean
a gentleman’s—lady, I ain’t a bit worser ’n—l
mean I’m equal to—the best of your Nobility ;so
there now!”
“Oh, Fenwick, I’m sure I—l didn’t mean you
weren’t,” said Mrs. Kent, for the first time becom-
ing despondent as to her plan, “ but don’t you see
it’s quite essential that they—that you—shall act
so as not to undeceive ’em till supper-time?”
“ Oh, stow your gab, Missus ! ” and the girl
flung, not ungracefully, her tall, lithe, well-shaped
figure on Mrs. Kent’s pet couch, “ I’ll come the
fine lady-lay all right when it’s the game. ”
“ But —but ” Airs. Kent was terrified. She
had had Ruth Fenwick in charge for a week as
her specially-assigned maid, and never yet had the
girl so revealed the base habits of speech and
thought which had been overlain by the veneer of
refinement picked up in the course of her dubious
relationships to “ fine gentlemen.”
“ But, but what ? ” mimicked the transport.
“D’ye mean my lingo? Are you afraid the
coves I dance with ’ll drop to me too soon. Speak
it out, old lady.”
Now, Mrs. Kent was not old. She was still
fair, was not fat, and was just forty. Therefore
to be termed “ old lady,” and by her own assigned
servant, was too much, and at the risk of upset-
ting the plan by which Messieurs the Mancipists
proposed to smash up Airs. Colonel Chester’s en-
tertainment, she resolved to assert her position.
“ You impudent thing, you ! How dare you
insult your mistress ! Don’t you know I can send
you to the Factory, and have all that hair of
yours off for your insolence ? ”
The transport rose from the couch and moved
towards the enraged lady with a menacing gesture
which frightened Mrs. Kent, but not nearly so
much as her words.
“ Oh, you’re a pretty one, ain’t you, to go on
this way? Now, look here, Mrs. Kent, I ain’t
been a first-rate moocher in London for nothin’,
and I ain’t been in your house a week for nothin’,
neither. How ’bout all those letters from young
Stephens to you in your dressin’-oase, eh? ”
“ What! ” shrieked the chatelaine of the Kent
household.
“ Or, rather, what ’bout those letters which
ain’t in your dressin’-case ? ”
“Oh, what —do —you—mean?” This with a
gasp, and a very obvious attempt at hysteria.
“What do I mean? I mean that you’re not
an old lady at all. You’re simply an old rip
a-carryin’ on with the son of your old man’s
partner, and you the mother of a grown-up girl.
An’ I mean I’ve got those letters. An’ I’m goin’
to make you pay to get ’em back. An’ if you
don’t take care I’ll bust you up instead of the
Nobility’s ball.”
“Oh, Fenwick! Oh, Ruth! how did .”
And Mrs. Kent here genuinely broke down.
Considered as a woman and not as a professional
female-transport, Ruth Fenwick was not all bad.
She’d got the whip-hand of Airs. Kent and she
knew it; but she was not wishful to ply the crop
unnecessarily. In vyhioh characteristic Aliss Fen-
wick, alias Mrs. This, That and the Other, simply
proved that she had not been brought up in the
first circles of Sydney society.
“ Here, dry up, and I’ll give you back your
letters. All except one—l’ll keep one, then I
know you’ll have to stick to me after the ball
affair.”
“ Oh—how did you get them ?”
“Lud, after Dressin’-case Bess was lagged—by
the way, ma’am, you’ve never run against her
here, have you, she was sent to the Bay ?—well,
after she was lagged, I was known as the best
hand at dressin’-cases an’ travellin’-bags in the
trade. I never saw but two cases I couldn’t open,
an’ yours weren’t one of ’em. But goin’ back to
what we started from, I’ll play brag at the ball
till I get some fizz into me.”
“ Fizz ! Do you mean champagne ?”
“Yes, o’ course. I won’t answer for what I say
or do when I take that wine.”
“But you won’t ask for any till supper, surely?
And after supper—after you’ve unmasked—”
“You don’t care what happens ? Oh, I under-
stand, missus. I’m not a fool by any means. But,
don’t forget—old lady! (Miss Fenwick would have
been more than human had she forgone that shot)
—that I’m goin’ to keep one of young Stephens’
letters. ”
Certainly Ruth Fenwick, No. 119 on ship’s list
per Lord Warden, was anything but a fool. Only
a fortnight in Sydney, she had already become
seized of what Chief Justice Francis Forbes (in a
letter which we will give to the world some day)
said was the central fact of Old Sydney life.
“Sydney society was born in corruption, and moved
on wheels of bribery, blackmail, and hush-money.’’
* * *
Panel the Second.—Madame De Voleure’s
fitting-on room in George-street. Aladame had
quite the best business in the .colony. Lady
Darling herself patronised her, and the wonderful
Queen Elizabeth dress in which the stately hostess
of Chesterdale would receive her guests on the
night of the ball had already been sent home, after
eliciting volumes of admiration from all who had
had the privilege of seeing it. “Do the thing in
style,” had said ’Mancipist Paul Kent, and there-
fore Mrs. Kent resolved to solicit Madame’s aid.
But she visited Madame (with Ruth Fenwick in
attendance) in the stillness and shadow of the
evening.
“I've been a good customer to you, Madame?”
“Oh, vary, Madame! A coostomar, good
always.” Madame (originally from Kent) had
an idea that the pure Parisian accent lay in
broadening of the vowels, and the idiom in bring-
ing her qualifying terms to the ends of her sen-
tences.
“ Then you must oblige me in a little thing. You
must get a ball costume ready for this —young
lady (she pointed to the veiled figure of Ruth) on
the quiet. It’s to be an expensive one, and over
and above your bill the sum of ten pounds will be
paid you, Madame, to —to .”
“Vat say you, Anglash ladies? Your tongue
to hold ?”
“Yes, Madame, that’s what I meant to say.
No one must know who the dress has been ordered
by, or for whom it is intended.”
“ Certainement, Madame. Mam’selle, then .”
Madame De Voleure stopped, aghast for a
moment. For Miss Fenwick had lifted her veil,
and was most inexplicably (as Mrs. Kent would
have thought) winking. Madame was recalled to
herself by a slight cough from Miss Fenwick.
“Mam’selle then is to ze ball goin’ on—vat
say you?—on ze sly ?”
THE OBVIOUS ALTERNATIVE.
MRS. FITZBOOSE : “Thank you very much, but I never take tea.”
AMIABLE HOSTESS ( sweetly ): “Dear me! I am so sorry I haven’t got any whisky.”
“That is it,” said Mrs. Kent, both relieved and
distressed to find that the acute-witted costumUre
had so quickly read her game. “ What character
would you suggest ?”
Madame De Voleure meditated for a full second
with finger-tip resting on her artistically-rouged
cheek, and then replied :
“ Oh, Mam’selle must to ze ball go as thatmees-
fertoonate queen vary, Marie Antoinette. Mam’-
selle is too long—vat you say too tall, a leetle;
but, zen, Mam’selle would ze queen ra-present
parfectly. She has ze beauty, an’ she has ze grace,
an’ she has ze—ze vartue,”
“ Mam’selle ” looked to the wall. Mrs. Kent
thought she had turned her head to blush unob-
served. Not she ; she had glanced aside to laugh.
“ Oh, Marie Antoinette ’ll do nicely. Don’t
you think so, Fen —dear ?”
“ Mam’selle ” couldn’t trust herself to reply so
near was she to choking with laughter, so she
nodded assent.
“ Zen, Madame, if so good you vill be as to
take some, vat you say rest one leetle, mam’-
selle I vill make some mazures from in zis room
’ere. An’, p’r’ps, Madame, you vill like zis book
to oversee. ” As she spoke the costumiere opened the
door of an inner room, into which she bowed
Miss Ruth Fenwick, and followed the action by
handing to her patroness a volume of coloured
prints of fancy-dress costumes. Mrs. Kent sank
into the voluptuous velvet of a couch to glance
over the plates, sending an inquisitive look now
and again into the apartment where the De
Voleure plied inch-tapes and pins industriously
in the registration of “ Mam’selle’s ” finely-
proportioned contour. Almost as industriously
she plied her tongue. But Mrs. Kent heard only
villainous English and professional French. She
did not know that the dressmaker was displaying,
in whispered interpolations, evidence that in her
exile she had lost none of her old-time proficiency
in thieves’ argot.
“ Mam’selle vill ’ave a costoome of Versailles,
or of ze ex-eoooshun, vot you say period! Oh,
Polly, who’d ’a’ thought of seein’you ’ere?” (This
last in a whisper).
“ And, Bess, when I saw you, old pal, from
’neath my flimsy, you could have knocked me
down—Oh, Versailles, of course—with a feather-
no executions for me, Betsy, laggin’s ’nuff,”
“ Zen we vill ’ave one robe broche, I vud say
vit trimmed bod ce an’ toonic in front—what yer
lagged for, Poll! —an’ vith flounces of broche an’
lace of gold ? ”
“ Ten years for nabbing my omee’sf yellow-
boys—as you please, Madame ! —but, Lud, to
think o’ Dressin’-case Bess a-doin’ the duds-lay.
Where’s your ruffler, Bess? Warn’t he lagged
same time as you ? ”
“ Ve vill ’ave ze bodee ’igh in ze back —yes, but
he got stretched for paddin’ the toby, they call it
bushrangin’ ’ere—an’ in ze front—’ow vill Madame
like Mam’selle’s bodee —Mam’selle’s cha-arms best
vill be deesplayed by one bodee ske-vare ? —What’s
yer name, Poll ? ”
Mrs. Kent, appealed to, answered that she
would leave the point of cut to Madame
De Voleure’s well-known taste. “Mam’selle”
acknowledged the compliment to her charms, and
the query by a dig in the dressmaker’s ribs, and :
“Bess, you donny, you were alius glib in the
gab. But ‘ stubble your whids ’J or you’ll put me
away. I ain’t Mrs. Flipperton now; I’m Ruth
Fenwick.”
“ ’Sh! Zen ve vill ’ave ze bod eese ske-vare.
An’ vot jooils vill Madame ’ave ze desire zat
Ma’m’selle shall vear ?”
“What would the De Voleure suggest?” was
asked from the outer room. Madame of Kent
was indifferent; her iewel-case was to be at
her young friend’s disposal. Ma’m’selle, on the
other hand, was of the opinion that pearls would
suit her best, all things considered.
“They would go best with robe and coiffure,
would they not, Mrs. Kent ?” she said to the
“old lady.” To the De Voleure, alias' “ Dressing-
case Bess,” she remarked, sotto voce (with another
dig into Madarae’s side): “Pearls is most appro-
priate to the virtuous, Bessy, ain’t they ? Where
d’ye get your lingo, Bess?”
“Shut up! I’m French. Mats, Madame
Kent —Mam’selle is as a queen goin’ to ze ball, an’
di-monds is for ze Majesty, ze—ze best, vary !
Poll, you’member Sparkler Ned? He’s ’ere.”§
“Certainly, Madame De Voleure, I quite agree
with you. I can afford the young lady the use
of some brilliants. ”
“And Sparkler Ned here! I nubble to your
game, Bess. If I get the stones he’ll foist the
dummies ?”
“ That’s the lay, Poll. Ah, zat is kind vary —
of Madame Kent. Allans, Mam’selle, I vill not
you trouble more at ze present. We vill, eef
Madame pleases, at ze vat you say, ma-tee-rial,
now look. ”
Mrs. Kent, so willing, was speedily immersed
in the contemplation of sundry silks and fal-de-
rals, out of which were to be compounded the
costume which was to manifest the De Voleure’s
skill, to display the Fenwick’s charms in con-
cealing them, and to ravish, to the point of burst-
ing at the Chesterdale party, the hearts of Mrs.
Colonel Chester’s masculine guests.
And while the wife of ’Mancipist Kent was sc
engaged, Ruth Fenwick, otherwise Poll Flipperton
and Mrs. This, That and the Other, and her old-
time crony, Madame De Voleure, familiar as
“Dressing-case Bess ” to the London police, found
opportunities to exchange mutual sympathies and
to renew ancient alliances.
“Ze ball is on ze of Mai ze zixteen. Mam’selle
shall call in one week before, to vat you call lit on,
an’ ze costoome vill be ready two free day ze ball
before. I vill mineself bring it to Aladame’s.”
(This to Mrs. Kent.) But unto Mrs. Kent’s
amiable protege, as she held the door open and
bowed them to their carriage, this : “ I’ll bring
Ned’s fiilyll with me, Poll, as ’sistant. You ’ave
the sparklers ready, and she’ll ’ave the wax.”
And, to anticipate shortly, we may here remark
that, while Madame Voleure occupied, on the
occasion of her taking home Marie Antoinette’s
dress, Mrs. Kent’s attention with a deeply-in-
teresting account of the numerous costumes she
had created for the ball —“An’ none of zem,
Madame, vill vot you say eke-val Mam’selle’s ” —•
her assistant was hastily but accurately taking an
impression of Mrs. Kent’s diamonds. Transport
Ruth Fenwick, per Lord Warden, had as facile a
knack at opening jewel-boxes as in the manipula-
tion of dressing-cases,
* # *
Panel the third—the dining-room at Mr.
Harrington’s villaon theeveof theChesterdale ball.
Mr. Harold Harrington, at the foot of the table,
nerving himself for an unpleasant task. His wife
speaks from the head.
“Nell and I will be ready, dear, at nine o’clock.
S’pose we say the carriage at half-past ? ”
Mr. Harrington (of the Treasury) looks down
on his fruit-plate and toys with his nut-crackers,
but gives no sign that he has heard the voice of the
wife of his bosom.
“Harold, did you not hear me? I wish the
carriage to be ordered by half-past nine.”
“Eh, what, dear ? Oh, yes, the carriage. But,
look here, I ”
“You what? You’ve been having too much
wine, Mr. Harrington.”
“Well, this, dear, and you, Nelly. I—l- .”
“For heaven’s sake, Mr. H., what is it? Aren’t
we going to the ball ?”
Mr. Harrington jerked out his reply in an
agitated fashion.
“ Well—no —not—all of us !”
“ What!” shrieked his womankind in startled
chorus.
“ The fact is—Nell—you can’t go !”
“ What! Harold, you’re drunk !”
“Pa! ma ! Oh! —oh!” (Preliminaries to
hysterics.)
“ It’s not a bit of use going on in this way!”
In his desperation Mr. Harrington found his
words ran away with him, “ Damn the Chester
ball say I, damn the old minx for insulting the
’Mancipists, and damn—damn— you!”
“What !”
“Yes, you! It’s all your own fault—if a
woman will gratify her mean spite she must
suffer.”
“ Will yon, if you haven’t quite lost your senses,
be good enough to explain, sir.” (Never' before
had Mrs. Harrington felt the necessity to play
with severity the combined role of the Injured
Mother and the Outraged Wife.)
“ Didn’t Mrs. Chester issue her card for to-night
with a letter that she wouldn’t receive members
of the ’Mancipist families ? Didn’t Nell there, who
is shamming to faint (a moan from Nell !) go and
make the insult personal by showing her card to
the Kent women ? Answer me that, my ladies !”
“ Well, and what then? That’s no reason why
you should go mad ! ”
“Isn’t it? Well, if you must know all—l’m
under Kent’s thumb. He can ruin me to-morrow.”
. “Horrible!”
“Pa!”
“ Oh, you’re better, are you, Miss ? I’m glad of
it—glad to know, too, that you know at last that
your silly girl’s trick has induced Kent, in order
to get revenge, to buy up all my bills and to take
over from Quaker Tawell the mortgage on this
property, and that he has threatened me to press
for every penny at once, unless ”
“Oh ! Unless what ? ”
“ I take his daughter to the ball in place of
Nell there.”
Nell’s hysterics came now with a vengeance.
But the father and the mother let her cry. “ It’ll
do her good,” said the former. He was a man,
you see, and, therefore, never being in the habit of
giving way to bursts of unreasonable passion, had
no sympathy with the nervous demonstrations of
his women-folk. “ It’s too horrible !” gasped the
latter, who was less shocked at the imminence of
ruin than at the supremacy in her husband’s affaii-s
of one of the cursed ’Mancipist brood. “ It’s too
horrible !”
“It’s bad, but it might be worse. Kent pro-
mises if I do this, he’ll release me from some of
my bills. ”
“ Why did you give him the bills ? Why don’t
you let him sue? He can’t recover in Court,
being a ’Mancipist,”** sobbed Mrs. Harrington,
who evidently thought it was high time she, too,
broke down.
“ Talk sense, wife, do !” ejaculated the badgered
Harrington. “Kent is a C.P. man, and not a
ticket-of-leave ; And, even if he were, all that
he’s got to do is to assign his interests to a free-on-
arrival or free-by-servitude man and get a ver-
dict.”
“The officers won’t give a verdict against a
Treasury man.”
“Won’t they ? They won’t in most ’Mancipist
cases, but there isn’t a panel now in Sydney who
would dare to give a verdict against Paul Kent,
or Pete Stephens, or Sam T , or three or four
other big ’Mancipists. No; I’ve simply got to
pay up—which I ean’t —or take old Kent’s
daughter.”

§“Sparkler Ned”: The author pleads guilty to a
slight anachronism here. Sparkler Ned, an artist in the
substitution of paste diamonds for the real thing, did not
leave London, under banishment, for two years after
the date of Mrs. Chester’s ball. Nevertheless, as Mrs.
Kent’s diamonds, lent to “Marie Antoinette ” asgenuine,
were returned as paste, it is to be presumed that Sparkler
Ned had a predecessor in Sydney.

(Now you will remember Paul Kent had never
stipulated that Harrington should take his [Kent’s]
daughter to the ball. He had done no more than
insist that the Treasury dignitary should escort
“a lady” to the Chesterdale festival instead o,
his own girl, Nell.)
“ Then, unless Nell is to go—and our dresses all
ready, too !—I shan’t go ! 1 won’t chaperone an
old lag’s chit. And there’ll be a pretty row when
they unmask at supper 1”
“ No, there won’t. Kent has promised to have
his trap outside the gate by 12.30, and I’m to see
the girl to it then.”
“ He’s promised, has he ? Mark my words he
will do nothing of the kind! His trap! Yes—
I don’t doubt it —the whole thing’s a trap, that s
what it is ! ”
“Pooh, pooh !” rejoined Harrington, greatly
relieved that he had got the trouble over (though
there was a sweet savour of sal volatile and burnt
feathers from the adjoining room.) “Hell not
lay a trap to expose ids own daughter to insult.
Don’t you see he’s only anxious to enable his girl
to show Nell that, after all, it was she who
went to the ball— she, the ’Manoipist’s daughter—
and that she went, too, on the card of invitation
sent to the daughter of the big man at the
Treasury. ”
But Mrs. Harrington being a woman, and,
therefore, distinctly unamenable to masculine
reasoning, persisted that she could not see it,
would not see it, should not see it.
“ What apology shall I make for you, my dear,
to Mr. Chester ?” _
“ What you please, Mr. Harrington. Tell her
what you like, because you’re iinposing on her hos-
pitality and insulting herself and her guests”
and boo-hoos —more singed feathers —more sal
volatile completed Mrs. Harrington’s sentence.
At nine-thirty, however, as Harold Harrington,
Esquire (of the Treasury), stepped in the not
altogether inappropriate disguise of a Bandit of
the Apennines from his hall steps into his car-
riage, and at the very instant that he opened his
lips to instruct his coachman to call at the Kent
mansion, Mrs. Harrington spoke her mind once
more from the doorway. _ _
“Mark my words, Mr. Harrington, it’s a trap ! '
Which remark was the text from which many a
domestic sermon was to be preached in the near
future.
* * *
Panel the fourth—Mrs. Kent’s double
drawing-room. In the ante-portion Paul Kent,
Emancipist and “ Ancient,” and Harold Harring-
ton, Esquire, member of the Colonial Aristocracy
and First Family man. In the inner portion
behind the folding-doors (left slightly a-jar) Mrs.
Kent and Mademoiselle Kent —and Ruth Fen-
wick. Not that you would have recognised Miss
Ruth in the fascinating creature who stood just
within the rim of light thrown by the shaded
lamp, and smiled in all her purchased —and pur-
chaseable—graces. It was quite evident that the
Transport, per Lord Warden, who was numbered
119 on ship’s list was going to enjoy herself who-
ever else did not at Mrs. Chester’s masquerade.
In the outer drawing-room Mr. Harrington
speaks. In the inner, three feminine heads bend,
on the first syllable, nearer to the interstice of the
folding-doois.
“ Well, I’m here, Mr. Kent, to carry out my
part of the bargain. Is the young lady ready ? ”
“ The young lady is ready, and I, also, am ready
to perform my share of the agreement. I have
your overdue and protested bills here for £327 Us.
fed. sterling in favour of Mr. Samuel T ——. Will
you glance at them to see if they are in order?
No, sir, they can’t go out of my possession yet.
You can look at them in my hand.”
“ Sir ! ”
“ Now, pray, don’t be indignant, Mr. Harring-
ton ! ” The old man was asthmatic, but be con-
trived to infuse a fine irony into his next wheeze.
“You are a public servant, sir, hence are not to
be trusted with another person’s property.”
Harrington flamed to rose-red passion, but ho
knew that he had met his match.
“ These bills are my property till——.”
“The girl’s in my carriage. That was your
statement.”
“Exactly; you have a capital memory for
spoken words—better than your written ones.”
And the ’Mancipist flaunted the dishonoured
notes under the other’s very nose with one hand,
while with the other he rang a bell.
“James,” he said to the footman (a burglar
with violence) who appeared in answer to the
tingle, “ announce to the ladies that Mr. Harring-
ton’s carriage is waiting. And, James, see the
young lady to the carriage—Mr. Harrington will
be down presently.”
Three minutes later Mr. Harrington was down.
He had got his bills the moment the gentleman of
burglarious and violent tendencies had reported
that the young lady was “ waiting Mr. Harring-
ton’s pleasure ” —he had responded to Mr. Kent’s
enquiries as to “whether they were all right by
a sullen “Yes !” he had first torn the notes into
a hundred pieces and then ignited the fragments
by the flame of a waxen candle —and he had
marched out—furious and revengeful. He made
no salutation to the ’Mancipist, nor did he deign
to indicate that he heard Mr. Kent’s words; “I
shall be at Chesterdale gate at 12.30, Mr. Harring-
ton, with my carryall.” He was too busy to do
either one thing or the other, inasmuch as his
whole powers were devoted to framing the most
elaborate maledictions on the ’Mancipist tribe. _
It was to be somewhat regretted in his own in-
terests that he was so pro-occupied. Otherwise it
is possible that he might have overheard Mr.
Kent’s remarks to Mrs. and Miss Kent as those
ladies emerged into the front drawing-room,
“ Don’t forget, my dears, that you saw and
heard he accepted those bills as tlie ones he had
made.”
“Why, Paul ? ” questioned the matron.
“ Because, Jane, those were not the bills he
made. Those are of old Pounce’s manufacture.
“ Forgeries, Paul ! ”
“ lorgenes, Jane ! I have the originals still,
They may come in useful, yet. And the old
rogue chuckled in a way that would have been
merry if he had not been quite so asthmatic,
Old Pounce (twice oapitally-condemned former)
one of the chiefest institutions or Ulcl
Sydney. It is difficult to see how Old Sydney life
could have been what it was but for Old Pounce,
Everybody used him from high Government
officials to new y-arnyed transports who, not due
fora ticket-of-leave for three or four years, yet
were anxious to possess one a couple of months or
so after landing. Particularly useful party, Old
Pounce ! • „

The centre-piece—Mrs. Colonel Chesters
supper-table. The “brilliant galaxy of guests”—
the words are Mr. Robert Howe’s, of the Sydney
Gazette —“filed to their places to add the
beauties of feminine grace and masculine vigour to
the magnificently-spread and elegantly-adorned
tables.” At the cross-table—where were grouped
the seats of honour —the unmasked hostess, an
Imperial Elizabeth in black velvet, filled the
centre-chair. On her right, unmasked also, in his
General’s uniform, Governor Sir Ralph Darling;
0 n her left, robed as a Judge of Assize, Chief
Justice Forbes, who, notwithstanding his well-
known fondness “ for doing justice to the ’Manci-
pists,” was too powerful to be socially slighted by
the First Families. Three chairs away from Lady
Darling (“ Marie Theresa ”), who sat next to the
noble Chief Justice, was a Marie Antoinette
assiduously waited upon by an officer whose
domino did not hide the uniform of the 57th
Regiment. It was “a table of Sovereign beau-
ties,” as Mr. Robert Howe wrote.?! But, of
course, the beauties were only partially discernible
IN THE SMALL HOURS.
POLICEMAN (looking in at open window) ; “'Ere, why don't you go to bed?"
HIGHLY-CHILLED JOURNALIST (looking up from “ copy ”): “'Cause, unlike you, I've got
to work hard for my living.
as yet: the hour had not yet come for general
unmasking. With the first toast, the guests were
to unmask.
Twenty chairs distant from the cross-table a
Bandit of the Apennines, who had, in his agita-
tion, left his silk face-piece in Mr. Kent’s drawing-
room, was doing his best to drown his fears by
looking upon some red Portugese wine.
Brilliant among the beautiful, Marie Antoinette
had enjoyed herself to the utmost point of
rapture. Harrington, paying his devoirs to
Queen Elizabeth on his arrival in the ball-room,
and being without his mask, had, of course, been
recognised. And her Majesty of England had
been gracious enough to touch with her lips her
sweet sister of France. “How your daughter is
growing, Mr. Harrington. I’ll forgive you, you
naughty man you, for coming without your mask,
because you have brought so magnificent a
costume. But where is Mrs. Harrington ? Now
that I know you and your daughter, may not I
know what character Mrs. Harrington has as-
sumed?”
“ Am deeply—ah—sorry, Mrs. Chester, but my
wife was suddenly—l mean, she has an exces-
sively bad headache to-night— ”
“ Oh, so grieved ! But, nevertheless, lam sure
the lady brought by Mr. Harrington will carry
off the major honours to-night. To have had a
second member of the family would have been for
you to monopolise all.”
This gratifying reception was merely the pre-
lude to the triumphs of the evening.
First of all, Marie Antoinette, with Lieutenant
Charles Darling (who by-and-bye was to dance
another sort of figure in Victorian history),
formed bottom couple in the first set of the Stale
Quadrilles. In Le Pantalon, her partner thought
her pretty; in L’Ete, beautiful; in La Poulc ,
fascinating; in La Trenisc, entrancing; and in
the grand rond of La Finale, a goddess ! Mane
Antoinette had not mixed with the best West End
society for nothing. Her conduct and her speech
were unexceptionable. As yet she had not tasted
a mouthful of champagne.
Young 'Chester himself, in whose and whose
bride’s honour the ball was given, danced the first
waltz with her. And with the finesse, so character-
istic of a First Family scion, he thereafter assured
his x>retty, lifeless young English wife, “ that she
was a stick at dancing compared with that
Harrington girl,” For, tire news that the Mane
was Nell Harrington had spread throughout the
great ballroom, through the paradise of the conser-
vatories and out in the glades of the shrubberies.
People wondered where Harrington’s daughter
had got her esprit and grace from all at once.
For every dance she found a difficulty in select-
ing her partners, she was besieged so numerously.
But it was Lieutenant Charles she favored most
frequently, and to whom, in a coy whisper, she
granted permission to take her into supper, and
whose aid she invoked for the after-supper-minuet.
Which was never danced.
* * *
The little rift, which by-and-bye was to
make mute the music of the Band of the 39th
Regiment which acted as Mrs. Chester’s orchestra,
was visible after Maria Antoinette’s first glass of
champagne. Lieutenant Charles poured it out
for her. She modestly demurred—“ vowing she
would ne’er consent, consented ” —sipped—drank.
The effect was electric.
“Never been at Bath Park-room, sir? And
this is almost as ‘rorty’ as that. Who’d ’a thought
this was Botany Bay !”
“ W-h-at —your Majesty? I—l’m afraid I did
not quite catch what you said. ’
“ Oh. never mind ! twice boiled cabbitch an. •
no good. Here, tip ns some more fizz, cully.”
Blindly, not believing his own ears, Lieutenant
Charles refilled her glass. She absorbed the con-
tents in a most unqueenly fashion. As she put
down her glass she caught a remark, dropped
by a venerable gentleman in the costume of the
Ancien Regime.
“As I was saying, we treat the assigned
pris’ners too liberally. Look at their clothes, for
instance. It’s an extravagant allowance foi
assigned men. For assigned women it’s simply
waste.”
“ Why, sir?” Marie Antoinette raised her voter
so that the old gentleman (one Mr. John Mac
arthur) should hear her. “What do the wonm;
get ?” _
Capt’n John rattled the list off glibly. You
couldn’t beat Capt’n John when it was a matter
of reciting regulations unless you put up his sou
James against him.
“Annual dress allowance to convict women—
one cotton gown, two bed-jackets, three shifts,
two flannel petticoats, two stuff petticoats, two
pair shoes, two calico caps, three pairs stockings,
two'neck ’kerchiefs, one check .”
“Lud, don’t I get no more things than them ?”
# * #
Then happened the beginning of the end.
Her voice raised excitedly, Marie Antoinette’s
words carved out a broad area of shocked silence.
Just as she spoke, however-, the toast-master from
behind Sir Ralph Darling’s chair called out —
“Ladies and gentlemen will please unmask while
I give, ladies and gentlemen all, ‘The King’;
God bless him.”
There was a rustle as the masks came off. At
the lower end of the great room—you can still see
its gables from the Liverpool Road—the tinkle of
laughter, and the moving of chairs back, as guests
rose to welcome the toast; but in the neighbour-
hood of the table of dignity—silence.
Which was broken by a woman’s voice exclaiming
in decidedly hiccupish accents —
“The King! I’ll s-show you—ladies an’ gents
—’ovv me an’ the King—God blesh ’im ! —danced
the fandango at Brighton.”
Before her cavalier could stop her she had
rested a hand on his shoulder, and with that
support mounted to the table. Balancing herself
for a moment while she picked up a couple of
spoons, she began the slow movement of the
fandango. With an aptness that told that the
performance was not the first under like condi-
tions, she played the spoons in castanet fashion,
and i-apidly, before the astounded crowd, deve-
loped the voluptuous rapidity of the dance, her
diamonds glittering gloriously in the light of two
hundred candles.
“ I want a partner; get up, Cully !” she shouted
out, once.
But Lieutenant Charles, although he heard her
voice distinctly over the crash of silver and glass
which she cleared from the table in the sweep of
her silk-shod feet, declined the invitation.
Three minutes she might have danced before the
appalled though fascinated guests, when the whim
seized her to unmask. She flung the piece of
stiffened silk to the floor.
Mr. Seragge, Barrack-master (he was attired as
a Greek pirate), saw her face then, identified her,
and shouted so that above the ring of the castanets
his exclamation was heard by all:
“By Gad! It’s Ruth Fenwick, convict per
Lord Warden,”
Ruth Fenwick, otherwise Mrs. Polly Flipperton,
otherwise Marie Antoinette, stopped exhausted
in her wild evolutions and heard him.
“ Lud, pal, ’ave you only just found that out! ”
was her retort. And another voice confirmed the
news.
“ I have to apologise for this intrusion, Mrs,
Chester, and I was hopeful to arrive before any
scene happened. Unfortunately I see I’m too
late. Constable, that’s the woman—my assigned
servant, Ruth Fenwick.”
Mr. Paul Kent, J.P. (with a constable in hia
company) was the speaker. As the constable
advanced to arrest Marie Antoinette —he had an
awful work getting her to Charlotte Place watch-
house—Mr. Kent made a further explanation to
Colonel Chester.
“ I heard, sir, that the woman had been induced
to leave my house to-night by some officer of the
Civil Establishment, and making further enquiries
found she had been driven here. lat once feared
she had been brought to make a scene. I can’t
say how sorry I am this has happened.”
As we happen to know that the Pure
Merinoes’ Ball Smash-up Fund had been originated
by Mr. Kent, and that he had himself subscribed
100 guineas to it, we take the liberty of doubting
Mr. Kent’s veracity.
PRICE WARUNG.
If Wrote, but did not publish. The Press Censor struck
the phrase out.
Saved from Misery.
Mrs. Fauny Dent, wife of a gentleman employed
in the Lambton colleries, kindly allows ns to
publish the following facts of her interesting case
and wonderful recovery, which we gather from
her correspondence, and which we shall be glad
to allow anyone to peruse who wishes to do so.
Mrs. Dent has been in a state of extreme debility
for twelve years, frequently quite unable to do
any work, the lightest kind causing great fatigue,
with severe pains in the limbs, back, and left side.
Ho severe was the pain that she would have to sit
or lie down frequently. Walking exercise was
very trying and she could only walk very slowly.
She had long seen Clements Tonic advertised, but
like many more people, her husband was prejudiced
against “ patent medicines,” but (now' we use her
own words) “I knew some one who had tried
Clements Tonic, and I decided to get a bottle on
the quiet and say nothing about it if it did me no
good. The effect I thought something wonderful.
I felt better after the first dose, and by the time I
had taken half a bottle I was a different woman.
My husband, friends and neighbours soon noticed
the change in me, and they could not make it out.
I had to tell the truth that it was Clements Tonic
that was making me strong. I could not keep the
secret, I was only too glad to give the credit to
Clements Tonic. After finishing the bottle, Avork
was no trouble to me, but rather a pleasure, and
after doing a heavy day’s washing I could go for a
walk instead of having to go to bed, as always
happened before taking Clements Tonic. , One of
my neighbours said to me last week —Why, Mrs.
Dent, you are dou% wonders this week, how is it
you are so strong now?” She knew I had done
more that week than I had been able to do in 12
years before (she had known me this time, for I
am an old resident of this locality, having lived
here for 15 years.) I replied : ‘Yes, I feel a
wonder to myself, so I’ll tell you the secret; I
have been taking Clements Tonic, and I cannot
tell you the benefit I have derived from it. You
know what my sufferings have been, and now I
have a genuine taste of good health.’” Mrs.
Dent wrote us those particulars of her remarkable
cure in March. She wisely, however, decided to
continue the medicine to “clinch the cure” as it
were. Some time afterwards she wrote as follows :
“ Waratah Commonage, N.S.W., —Dear sir,—lt
is with great pleasure that I pen these few lines.
1 have been as you know a great sufferer from
weakness and debility for years. I was under
several doctors, but they never did any good. I
despaired of ever being better, but as I stated in
ray last letter I saw Clements Tonic advertised. I
tried a botfle and its effect ivas something wonder-
ful. I felt better almost immediately, and was a
new woman after finishing the first bottle. Before-
taking Clements Tonic it was a great trouble even
to do a little house-Avork, but afterwards my work
was a pleasure, and my friends and neighbours
were surprised at the change in me. I cannot say
too much in praise of it, and can only gratefully
describe my case and strongly advise all Avho
suffer from Aveakness, backache, pain in the side,
ringing noises in the ears, and shortness of breath
to take Clements Tonic. I feel sure it Avill do
them as much good as it has done, me.—Yours
gratefully, Fanny Dent.” Wo have great pleasure'
in thanking this lady for allowing us to publish
tins case. " We constantly hear of similar ones
which people object to have published through a
false delicacy. We only want to publish them in
the interests of suffering humanity. Surely it is
not wrong for people to acknowledge the genuine-
ness and reliability of an article, Avhen they have
proved it to possess the properties Ave claim for it.

lb is to be hoped that Australia will soon
see the very last of the vice-regal postilion non-
sense. This is a country where even the horses
must have democratic privileges. Any Governor
who has his horses ridden while they are also
being driven should be prosecuted by the Society
for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals. Any-
how, it is cruel to make a noble rnoke figure in a
show which in a really sporting country only
excites the disgust and derision of the populace.
# # *
At the Federation dinner, Mrs. Mayoress
Burdekin was sandwiched between Lady Jersey
and Lady Parkes. Real strategy would have been
shown by sandwiching Lady P. between Mrs. B.
and Lady J.
# * *
Gov. J ersey is said to be the most obliging
man south of the line. When he has to speak at
a gathering at which Premier Parkes also orates,
he makes a point of dropping his finals, and says
“nothin’,” “havin’,” “doin’,” &c., in the most
courteous manner. He has not yet, however,
achieved the Parkesian orthographical vanity of
substituting a “k” fora “g” in such words as
“ nothink,” but he has ’opes of accomplishing even
that feat shortly.
# # *
On the second day of the Convention there
appeared on the flagstaffmver N.S. W. Parliament
House the Union Jack, and it has waved there
evei’y day since. This flag does not flutter in the
breeze when the N.S.W. Parliament is in session
—except on opening day—then why should it be
hoisted over the Convention ? Why, indeed,
except to demonstrate that Parkes is grovelling at
the feet of Royalty. “No lip-service loyalty
about me,” said Parkes at the Federation Confer-
ence in Melbourne. We wish we could bring it
home to the deluded old man’s imagination with a
dull cold bash that there are a large number of
reasons why he will not get the hereditary mark of
Royal favour for his Federation “hefforts.” If
he could once thoroughly comprehend his position
with regard to the Peerage he might easily be
induced to dye his hair vermillion —like the tail of
the Cyclorama’s advertising horse —and howl for
the Republic.
# # #
After all, it would seem that Lady Jersey
does not always wear the—er, governing garb.
She attended the Federal Convention the other
day with her guide and beacon, and at the con-
clusion of the sitting jumped up with something
like pleasurable excitement to shake hands with
some of the delegates. Jersey, however, just
suppressed her into her seat with a gesture, which
said as plainly as words, “My dear, you must
contain yourself. When you are to have your
little innings I’ll let you know. I’m running this
show.” She went down without a word.
* # *
Vice-regality seems to be desperately fond
of the gentlemen who can supply it with “the
straight griffin.” Carington used to worship the
late James W'dte, espec’ally when his horses were
winning; Kintore’s affection for the owner of
Carbine is pathetic in its tenderness, and now
Hopetoun may be seen clinging to one of the
Millers, if the stable happens (as it usually does)
to have a “ good thing ” going “over the sticks.”
# * #
Yarrangobilly, N.S.W., has been re-
christened “Jersey.” How proud of their native
country these Australians are !
* # #
The Federal Convention has gathered
together a lot of fossils in Sydney, including a
hash-house keeper from Tasmania who landed at
a big coffee-palace with his boxes blazoned all over
thusly—“ Hezekiah Mutton, Esq., Mayor of
Goose Green Gully.” The Mayor went out walk-
ing one Sunday morning intending to paralyse the
town, and when he returned his door was placarded
with letters a foot long setting forth that the
“ Mayor of Goose-Green Gully,” slept within.
He never wilted, simply took it as one of the
attentions paid to distinguished visitors, and so
“the boys” determined to go one better. They
did, for they promptly sent him an invitation,
purporting to come from the Mayor of Bondi,
who requested the honour of the visiting digni-
tary’s presence to dinner at his (Bondi’s) town-
residence, House. Goose-Green Gully bit,
and marched round to House arrayed in his
most frayed and best suit. After standing on
the doorstep for some time, getting his collar and
eyebrows straight, he knocked timidly, and on
asking for the Mayor of Bondi, was rudely re-
pulsed by the showy young female who opened
the door as an idiotic old hayseed, who ought to
know better.
* # *
The other day there stepped into a Sydney
tramcar a most elegantly-dressed and fetching
woman. In the same compartment there hap-
pened to be a member of Parliament whose eye
lingered long and lovingly on the enchantress.
Presently there came along the ticket-collector,
apparently a new man, for he knew not the mem-
ber, and so demanded a ticket instead of allowing
the potentate to pass unchallenged. When the
conductor had departed the eminent statesman
proceeded to address the lady: “No doubt,
Madam er you—er —haw —may be—er —ah —
somewhat surprised at my not having paid my—er
—fare, but the—aw—fact is that (here holding out
his pass) my—er —pass as a —ah-Statesman,
renders paying superfluous !” “ Indeed !” frigidly
returned the fair creature, resuming her book.
This is the great man who on one occasion
got hold of a newspaper-reporter at Parliament
House and asked the latter his opinion as to the
most dignified way in which to write his (the
statesman’s) name—the way in which it would
look best in print. “Which would you prefer,
were you I, dear boy?” he enquired, proceeding
to write on the blotting-pad :
Mr. R. Bagley Jumpup, M.P.
R. Bagley Jumpup, Esq., M.P.
Mr. Richard Bagley Jumpup, M.L.A.
Richard B. Jumpup, Esq., M.L.A.
Mr. R. B. Jumpup, M.P.
and so on for half-a-column. The reporter said
he didn’t quite know, but he was sure the news-
paper-men would gladly print the great states-
man’s name in any form the great statesman
selected. Mr. R. Bagley Jumpup, M.P., finally
fixed upon a “style and title ” and commended the
same to the attention of the press, but the scribes
laugh at him and make a point of alluding to him
A “MAN OF MARK”—OR, THE MODERN AUSTRALIAN BOOK-AGENT.
shortly as “ Mr. Jumpup.” That is the one great
sorrow of the great statesman’s life.
# * *
Geo. Sutherland, D.D., through the
medium of the Sydney press, requested that the
Federal Convention should be opened with prayer.
It was opened with a corkscrew, and probably
will be closed with nux vomica and spirits of
ammonia.

At Springwood, Blue Mountains, on
Monday week, a very shabbily-dressed person,
wet to the skin, got into the train, seated himself
in a corner of the carriage, and as soon as the
train moved off, stood up and began to undress.
As he removed each wet article, he threw it out
of the window. At last he stood there in a state
of nudity; then, taking a towel from the bag he
was carrying, he rubbed himself down. After
this he dressed himself in clean, dry clothes.
From the time he entered the carriage until he
was rehabited he never spoke a word, but
afterwards publicly explained that he had had to
walk a mile to the train in the wet, and that his
umbrella and mackintosh being in town he had
brought a change. That is the kind of man who
will get on in this world.

There are at least three divorced men
sitting in the New South Wales Legislative
Assembly.

Justice Webb ("Melb.) says the woman’s
oath is enough for affiliation. We are sorry to
hear this, for judges should be men of the world
and Judge Webb evidently knows nothing about
women. We must leave the question to be settled
between the partisans of the credulous Victorian
Judge and the incredulous Australian Chief
Justice who says privately (when he has taken six
large whiskies) that ‘' all men are liars and all
women are d liars.” Women, we must say,
have a good time in the Australian law-courts, for
there no man ever gets full justice against a
woman.

When Primrose Day comes round, Lady
Jersey will realise that she is indeed in a foreign
country. No statue of Beaconsfield have we, nor,
had we one, is there on the whole continent a single
silver-mounted ladder up wlrch her Ladyship
might climb as in days of yore to ornament with
flowers Dizzy’s effigy.

The English Freemasons, headed by the
Prince of Wales, have formally excommunicated
Sir Robert Stout of Maoriland from their ranks
on the ground that he belongs to the Grand Orient
Lodge of France, a purely democratic institution
which exacts no religious tests. English Free-
masonry, of course, is entirely devoted to the House
of Hanover and is among the chief means by which
that glorious dynasty is shored up. Stout’s weak-
ness in accepting a knighthood at the hands of the
very Court whose coming head has jumped upon
him with both feet, places him in a most invidious
position at the present juncture. The moral is
obvious.

The secretary of Melbourne Y.M.C.A. is
endeavouring to form a Commercial Travellers’

According to our horse-reporter, the
Ladies Dorothea and Estella Hope, at Flem-
ington last week, wore pale-blue gowns,
which, although warranted to wash, looked
as if they had been designed at some
distant period and afterwards cut short in
front so as to be quite a la mode and display the
fetlocks. The whole result was distinctly dread-
ful. Two dainty little feet, tripping gaily into
full view from beneath a poem by Worth, of
Paris, might possibly incite a jockey to fall down
and worship the very ground they send a thrill
through. But a pair of turned-in tootsies over-
shadowed by a skirt which stands out from the
waist at an angle of 45 all round, bring little con-
solation to the man who has come a cropper over
the last race. Lord Hopetoun’s crushed-strawberry
blonde relatives attracted the particular sacri-
legious bookmaker, who wanted to take odds that
Lady Dorothea was the long ’un, and Lady
Estella the short ’un, or vice versa —just as anyone
cared to bet. A staunch courtier looked wither-
ingly at this disgusting person, and asked him
how he could possibly discover which lady was
which. The skinner of lambs promptly explained.
He would, if necessary, go right up to ’em and
shriek “Dorry-t/ie-a !” and the first one as turned
round would be ’er, and he would pay out ac-
cordin’.

It was generally reported at Flemington
that Hopetoun had no fancy for Blackwood’s
Vengeance.

The story that little Lord Dudley is
“ engaged ” to one of the Prince of Wales’
daughters, though probably all moonshine, would
account for Tummy’s parental attitude to the
young man since he was arrested in a gambling-
hell. Nevertheless, it is barely conceivable that
an out-and-out Juggins with a “gone’’leg is to
be dragged into the Guelph circle for the sake of
his family diamonds, most of which may already
be glittering up the spout. Dudley, according to
the very latest accounts, is still making a deplor-
able object of himself, having started a sort of
Lucullus Club, where members invite their friends
to dine at 80 guineas ahead, and reckon the little
feed a failure, bai Jove ! if it costs less than £5OO.
The state of Tummy’s liver doesn’t admit of his
entering keenly into these intellectual enjoyments,
consequently he can’t want Dudley as a son-in-law
for the sake of getting peacocks’ brain soup gratis.
Nor is Albert Edward too dense to understand
that his young friend’s mania for baccarat is likely
to break out again worse than ever as soon as he
gets thoroughly accustomed to the glare of the
royal eye. Where, then, could be the object in
marrying Maud to this unreliable little gorger,
the degenerate son of a cranky father, whose one
great achievement was that historical visit to the
Sultan of Turkey’s harem, which cost him his ears
and qualitied the late Duke of Wellington to run
for the Geldings’ Plate, as old Squire Western
would have put it? However, if Maud hankers
after her Dudley, and has pointed him out to
mamma as the young man who alone can make
her happy, she may as well have him. Love, ac-
cording to Tolstoi, is the inevitable result of high
living, so it would be against Nature for Maud
not to desire a husband of some sort.

Mr. Johnny Bruce, of Melbourne, has
graciously cabled the announcement that somebody
(name, Johnny?) provided him with a farewell
banquet at the Hotel Metropole, previous to h’s re-
shipment for Australia. Also that J. B. Pa< tersou
celebrated the occasion with a speech remarkable
for its “patriotic fervour.” “Potty ” Bruce had just
such a farewell dinner before he left Melbourne,
and then the same old Jingo, if we r. member
rightly, delivered the same old eulogium upon
Victoria Regina and her faithful animal iho
British Lion. It makes us very tired.

A certain Melbourne suburb had civically
decided to have itself proclaimed -a city. The
kind of reception to be accorded the Governor on
the occasion of his official visit was being dis-
cussed when one of the members (chairman of a
Board of Advice under the Education Act) pro-
posed|; “ That a tribunal arch be erected on the
bridge, another tribunal arch at Brown’s Hill, and
yet another tribunal arch at the Town Hall.”

Perhaps the largest amount ever made in
Australia through the sale of one single building
was netted by Mr. Tom Curran, the Sydney wine-
merchant, who one morning was offered Temple
Court, Sydney (corner of King and Elizabeth
streets), and, after a little haggling, bought it
right away for £18,250. A year or so afterwards
he was crossing the street and was bailed up by
“Ginger” Clarke, who asked him if he wanted
to sell Temple Court. “I don’t,” replied Curran,
“ I’m quite content to keep it—it’s paying me 10
per cent. nett.” But what is your price?” asked
Clarke. “ £50,000,” replied Curran. “ I’ll get it
for you to-morrow morning,” replied “Ginger.”
And he did.

Public Library, a sensible custom from the Sydney
Library, It is now a rule that readers must leave
their books on the table, instead of replacing them
on the shelves. Numbers of books are reported
stolen, which afterwards turn up on the wrong
shelves ; for instance, Balzac’s “ Contes Drola-
tiques ” were found, only the other day, thrust
into the midst of the Theology, which Mephis-
tophelian act could hardly have been pure accident.
Another reform wanted is to engage a smart young

It is reported that Duncan Gillies is grow-

rests on a secure foundation. Gillies is about the
only man in Australia who manages to be both fat
and bony at the same time, and he has a shiny
look like the outside of an oiled dictionary, and
altogether he would be improved by a little hair.
Hopetoun’s beard, on the other hand, is a dead
failure, and the man who would grow such a thing
in the light of day is reckless enough to have a
shower-bath in the middle of Bourke-street right
on the tram-line. It is glaring and scrubby, and
looks like a squashed currant, or a quantity of

The Melbourne bank-clerks, apeing the
University-Students, took anight at Melbourne
Princess’s last week, having hired the amphi-
theatre for this gorgeous occasion. They macje
several laudable attempts to be funny between the
acts, but distinctly missed a point in not yelling
for the management to shut up the sliding-roof
and reduce their overdraft. On the other hand
they introduced a certain amount of pathos into
the proceedings by dangling a flag inscribed,
‘ ‘ What price bank-clerks —£60 a year ?” which
must have sent a cold shudder through several of
their female adorers down below.

That hereditary guinea-pig, the new Duke

inspection of our comic-opera girls. In his pre-
vious capacity of Lord Kimbolton, the Duke was

scenes. In fact, he was generally known there as
“ Uncle Kim.” Now, we want to know if Bessie
Bellwood is coming with him. He’ll need her in

A Melbourne paper points out two interest-
ing facts. (1) That George Labertouche, charged
at Sydney Water Police Court with a num-
ber of forgeries, was allowed a seat at the
solicitors’ table. In the same court a clerk, out
of work, charged with forging one cheque for a
pound, was placed behind the spikes. What has
the Minister of Justice to say to this ? (2) That a
subscription-list, in aid of the hard-up Sydney
Carmelite nuns, was started by the Stale Foul
proprietary. Ye gods !

We are told that in Sydney a scheme of
Juvenile Immigration is being darkly formulated
in most influential circles. In plain words, the
alleged society seeks to get hold of cheap boy and
cheaper girl labour for the immediate profit of
capitalists, under the avowed gospel that the
scheme is for the future benefit of the children
themselves. The object is to make willing
drudges out of pliable material. The servant-girl
difficulty is at the bottom of the scheme.

A certain Blue-ribbon Mayor from up
North was seated at the Federation banquet next
to a burly Parliamentary official who is a most
vigorous diner. Now, the Mayor “ never touches
it, ” so the burly guzzler cottoned to him amazingly
and drank the share of both. Bottle after bottle
of gold-top disappeared “all the same way,” and
the capable Bacchanalian “never seemed to get
any forurder.” The way he “ put it down ” was
only equalled by the way he “put it up” on
the Mayor. “Now, then, Queenslander,” he
would boisterously remark, “we must celebrate
that last sentiment with another. Here, waiter !

The “gag” is that he is only to be accompanied

Sir John Robertson once went up country
and came across ablackfellow who had lost a leg.
Filled with compassion, and cold water, Jack
instructed the local superintendent of police to lose
no time in securing a wooden limb for poor old
Tarpot. In due time the leg was strapped on to
Tarpot and the account for it was sent to Jack at
the Lands Department. Sydney, whence it was
duly forwarded to the Treasurer. The Treasury
returned it saying “ there was no vote for wooden
legs ’* and the voucher was bandied between the
two departments several times. At last one day,
while Jack was cogitating over the matter, a lead-
ing officer came in with a batch of papers. “ Here,
Mr. So and So,” said old man Robertson, “ I
ordered a wooden leg for a blackfellow and the
Colonial Treasurer is too blanky miserable to settle
the bill. What’s to be done?” “Oh,” said the
offic'al, coolly rubbing his hands, “shove it down to
the furniture-vote.” And it was shoved down.
Likewise, it was paid for out of the furniture-vote.

The S. M. Herald has made itself
supremely ridiculous by getting out a second
edition containing a column of hysterics about
the thousands of wicked, blood-thirsty shearers
up North, who had gone to upset a pub-
lican’s buggy and were kept at bay by
one heroic mounted police-sergeant and two
foot constables, who ultimately dispersed
them with great slaughter. Ye gods ! By the
way, the present writer believes that he knows
one of the gallant policemen mentioned in this
connection. Years ago, in Ear Northern Queens-
land, the brave officer referred to had in
his charge, at a diggings lockup, a well-
known horse-thief under committal, who, finding
time hang heavily on his hands, kindly offered to
assist his custodian in cleaning out a certain
flooded well. The prisoner went down for a spell,
and, after working for a few hours, came up say-
ing he felt very cold ; whereupon the “peeler,”
who bore his charge only official enmity, was
lowered to take up the running. The horse-thief,
when he found his friend safely at the bottom of
the well, cut the rope from the windlass, and then,
taking the constable’s horse, revolver, rifle, and a
fair amount of tucker, cleared out to the ranges.
It is pointed out that numbers of N.S.W.,
station-masters and railway night-officers have been
working continuously for three years without
holiday.
The Bulletin wishes to make a sugges-
tion for the benefit of the distracted bank-directors
of Australia and the countries round about.
Hitherto this harassed race has systematically
appointed all manner of sincere Christians, good
young men, and holy snufflebusters of every de-
scription, to take charge of the cash, and it has
been “left ” by this moral crowd every time. The
apostle who was bursting with texts has escaped
over the brim of the horizon and disappeared with
the entire contents of the office. The mild, con-
sumptive youth who absolutely wallowed in prayer
has bashed the safe into shivers with a sledge-
hammer and hooked everything out of it. The
solemn, spectacled Christian in the bill depart-
ment has feloniously discounted bad paper for his
low, carnal uncle, and stood in on the proceeds.
The dreamy, faraway-looking Y.M.C.A. person
has skedaddled with the loot, and the rest of the
preachers have gone the whole hog generally.
And because of these evil results The Bulletin
desires, as already mentioned, to make a sug-
gestion. It proposes that a new bank should be
started with a howling atheist as manager and a

profane and hard-drinking youth for chief account-
ant. The ledger-keeper will be an immoral person
who has been in gaol for bigamy, and two insol-
vent bookmakers will work under him. ihe
teller will be suspected of murder if possible, and
if that can’t be arranged he will at least be utterly
unprincipled; and as for the branch managers,
inspectors, and the like, nobody will be eligible
who has any kind of a character from a clergyman,
or the slightest reputation for benevolence or
piety or anything else. Any individual found
snuffling over a good book will be promptly
sacked ; anybody attempting to wear a heavenly
expression will be sacked instantly ; any person
developing a look of holy resignation will be
sacked faster even than either of the other two.
The official who rigs himself up in a white tie and
a sacerdotal aspect will be banged right out into
the gutter for the first offence, and if it is dis-
covered that any clerk in the bank’s employ has
been born of poor but honest parents he shall be
discharged relentlessly. If a relative of any
officer goes into the ministry that officer shall be
immediately removed to another branch, and an
employe who is seen attempting to manifest good
principles will go out the instant he can find his
hat and his month’s salary will be thrown to him
through the window, for employes who manifest
pood principles have broken more banks than can
be counted. And, above all things, if anybody is
found praying, or humming a little hymn, or
carrying a tract in his pocket, or wearing a rapt,
seraphic air, the cash will be immediately counted
to see that nothing has gone astray, and when
this ceremony is completed the offender will be
bounced out by the back door ; and the person
who is discovered giving a donation to a church
will have a fair chance to break his neck in his
hurried flight down the front steps. Last, but
far from least, anybody connected with the in-
stitution who attempts to Do Good in any way,
l anre or small, shall be firmly but sternly ejected.
There will be no defalcations or mysterious short-
ages in that bank either, and the reserve fund will
speedily rise to £11,000,000. Also the dividend
will be 581 per cent.
POLITICAL POINTS
The cost of the Federation banquet will be
something between one or two thousand ponn a.
The individual who so kindly and unquestioning y
“ pays for all ” will settle the bill.
The Canadian general elections have
resulted in a “ victory ” for the Government iy a
majority of 24 votes, a result which must strum
terror into the Imperialistic party.
The first thing is to get into Parliament,
and the next is to get appointed as member o a
Special Commission of Enquiry into i lungs in
General.- That’s when you feel all right.
The Victoria capitalistic party is ‘ judi-
ciously ” stuffing the electoral rolls, and a mine
will have to be sprung on the Munro Government
ere any One-man-one-vote Bill can be made law.
Some attempt has been made to conciliate
Playford, and he supported Parkes’ nomination
for President of the Convention. Nevertheless,
Tom has much bitterness in his heart, and an evil
leer in his eye.
One-man-one-vote has just been rejected
in the Commons by a majority of 102 votes. Up
to date it has been adopted by only one ot tne
Australasias—New Zealand —and all the Govern
ments are fencing it.
Premier Ballance, of N.Z., prophesies
that most of the future Governors of that colony
will be chosen from among the native-born. -Ims
may be taken as a promise that the Ballance
Government intend to support Sir George Grey s
Elective Governors’ measure.
In a late Times’ article, the writer asks —
Is the negro willing to go ?
Can the negro be dispensed with ?
How can he he removed ?
Whither can he be sent ?
Someone cynically suggests that the word “negro”
be dropped and that of “unemployed” substituted.
Parnell has been stung into declaring, as
he did long ago in America, that his aim has
always been the national independence of Ireland.
Just so. It comes to the old “ Robert Emmet ”
of free Ireland, for the rift between English and
Irish is racial, ineffaceable. Salisbury and
Chamberlain see this squarely enough, if Glad-
stone doesn't. Home Rule is only a step.
Premier Munro complained in public
t’other day that he was a managing director of
three Coffee Palaces—the Grand, Federal, and
Victoria—andnoneof them were booms. Theseand
the Federal Bank, the Federal Building Society,
and his stations at King Sound, Cambridge Gulf,
and Derby just about fill nine-tenths of his broad
Scotch mind, leaving a fag-end with which he
rules a nation.
There is a Young England Conservative
party favourable to the strikers. The fact is that
Liberalism is the worst foe to Radicalism, just as
the good is ever the bitter enemy to the best, and
the proletariat may squeeze as much out of
Salisbury as it will get from Gladstone. Ran-
dolph Churchill’s physic, not quite senseless, is to
crush the bourgeoisie between the upper and lower
jaw with Tory-Democracy.
E. Steinfeld, who has been everything
political by turns, has induced the Victorian
Chamber of Manufactures to declare that in its
opinion Parliament should have power to impose
differential duties in favour of Great Britain and
British possessions. What is Somersault Stein-
feld—mark you, Steinfeld the German-Australian,
not Steinfeld the Englishman or English-
Australian—giving us? To whom or what is
Steinfeld loyal ?
Queen Victoria has been upon the throne
about 54 years, during which time she has received
from a grateful country an average of, say,
£500,000 per annum. At compound interest this
sum figures out to about £150,000,000. Now, is it
worth it? A paper tells us that the Prince of
Wales during the 49 years of his life has drawn
£3,300,000 from the public Treasury, and his debts
now amount to £1,600,000. At compound interest
he has had, say, £50,000,000. Now, is it worth it ?
Premier Munro’s idea that the right of
appeal to the British Privy Council should be
maintained even after the Constitution of an Aus-
tralian Federal Court of Appeal, is certainly a
lovely idea. Munro’s proposal amounts to this :
that the man with a long purse shall be enabled
to carry his case through three expensive courts
instead of two. Apropos, would Munro give
Money a Privy Council appeal and deny such an
appeal to a citizen sentenced to death ?
J, P. Garvan, who was to have been a
delegate but was shunted in favour of Dibbs, has
once or twice put in an appearance on a back seat
among: the spectators at the Federal Convention.
Mr. Garvan is a gloomy-looking man and his
favourite preliminary words in speech-making are
“ I have a solemn duty to perform.” He was
only known to smile emphatically on one occasion.
He was presiding at a colossal insurance banquet,
and his colleagues told him that if he didn’t smile
he’d “ burst the whole show.”
Sir Samuel Griffith told the Federation
banqueters that he is and ever shall be indebted
“ for any success that he may have been able to
attain, or that he may attain in the future, to the
distinguished professors of the University of
Sydney” in his college days. He thus alleges
that he is an artificial man, without originality
and devoid of native braininess. In contrast,
Parkes is not a University man; neither was-
te come to Sir Samuel’s profession—the late Sir
James Martin. Neither is Chief Justice Lilley,
of Queensland.
Speaker Lee Steere, of W.A. Assembly, is
a stickler for ceremony. Hecently, he gravely
informed the members of the Assembly that he
considered that some difference should be made
in the manner of receiving messages from the
Legislative Council and from the Governor. As
a mark of respect to the latter, he suggested that
the bearer of the vice-regal message should be
permitted to traverse the Chamber and hand the
message to the Speaker in person ; while all
messages from the “other place” should be
delivered at the bar of the House. Suggestion
accepted unanimously.
Why Parkes’ tilt against “ professional ”
Governors in his banquet-speech ? This is how
the milk got into the cocoa-nut. Some years ago
Sir Hercules Robinson said at a London public
dinner something to the effect that Sir George
Grey was the only man in the Southern Hemi-
sphere to whom people could look for an authori-
tative opinion on the question of Australian
Federation, and this was reported in the papers
at the time. Parkes, knowing that ex-“ profes-
sional ” Governor Grey was coming to the Con-
ference, had a dig at the older and greater man by
sneering at the “ class ” to which Grey belonged.
Take this as your axiom : Transportation
always is, and always was, wrong. Every country
must consume its own smoke, nor c*an reference
be tolerated to the convict legislators, squatters,
parsons’ fathers, mothers, of any place on earth.
They cost too much, and the steam-roller has to
be trundled over them too lone:, there has to be
too much grinding in the sugar-pan to get out the
stalks. Let England consume its own smoke —
heaps of room for settlement on the antres wild
and deserts idle of the Scotch deer forests, with
all the advantage of the rich philanthropists being
able to take a run up and see their poor proteges.
But no, they want to shuffle them out of sight.
Put down a few pounds and cart the rubbish
clean out of the country to some other.
There can be no such possibility as all-
round “freedom of contract” in any country
which recognises private property in land. All
the country’s wealth comes from the land (or the
waters). The land-owner having got possession
of some of the wealth-producing commodity him-
self, has absolutely enslaved the landless man, who
has thus no “freedom of contract.” The land-
owner enjoys to the full “ freedom of contract ” to
employ labour at as low a wage as it will accept,
or not to employ it and personally wrest produce
and wealth from the land. The landless man has
the empty “ freedom of contract ” to accept work
for whatever the land-owner will give, or to clear
off the land and starve. This kind of “freedom
of contract” is the freedom of “no compulsion,
only you must.”
Extract from a Continental Socialistic
“ Catechism of a Woman of the People ” ;—
Q. What are you ?
A. I am a woman of the people.
q. What is your mission in life ?
A. To work and to suffer.
q. Why only to work and to suffer?
A. Because I am the wife of a slave.
Q. But you have children, who should be your joy and
consolation ?
A. The wife of the master has children, who are her joy
and pride. For me, I have no children ; they belong to
the master.
Q. Why do your children not belong to you ?
A. When they are 12, the factory and the mine take
them. No ; I have no children.
Q. But you have a husband to comfort and love you?
A. My husband does not belong to me ; he belongs tc
the master.
q. Why does your husband not belong to you ?
A. He leaves me at 4 in the morning; I don’t see him
again till 7 at night. Worn out with fatigue, he takes his
supper and goes to bed, to begin again next day. No, I
have no husband ; my husband belongs to the master.
And so on. That is how the Socialists educate
their women in politics.

846 Macquarie-street North, Sydney, March 11,1891-
Mt Dear Moorabinda,—
A great throng of all sorts of people attended the
first reception given by Lady Jersey at Government
House on 3rd inst., and however the Countess managed
the corners of her mouth while some of the grotesque
objects were bobbing and ducking in front of her in their
awful frocks and bonnets is a puzzle, for, unlike most
women, Lady Jersey seems to have a keen sense of the
comical. The arrangements differed slightly from that of
the Carington regime—the names being announced twice,
Captain “ Chumley ” , calling them from the door and
brother Rupert No. 2 repeating them to the Countess,
who received at the foot of the dais in the ballroom, a
line of artillerymen holding a cord down the room to
keep the visitants from straying in the wrong direction.
No attempt whatever had been made to decorate the red
drawing-room, which looked as if the family were remov-
ing, and it was noticeable that all small articles of vertu
were looked out of harm’s way. The piazza was covered
in with awnings, and there tea and coffee were served to
the crowd, who ate everything on the tables and smashed
a little crockery as well.
There was very little dressing; hundreds of the visitors
were perfect shudders from their heels to their bonnet-
strings. Lady Jersey (who, unlike Lady Carington, re-
ceived without a hat) wore a gown of pink silky material
with a spot of the same colour made with a round skirt
gathered very full on the hips and trimmed with two
bands running down the hem and up the front and back
of the skirt, of black lace insertion ; the bodice made
with full front and puffed sleeves at the top, with bands
of the lace insertion going three times round the arm and
once down the front of the bodice; collar with fine lines o f
black jet fastened by a diamond brooch; tan gloves and a
gold bangle. The countess held a large bouquet which
harmonized with her gown. Mrs. Sydney Burdekin, in
apricot striped canvas cloth trimmed with cream Spanish
lace and bars of sage-green silk, flat hat hi biscuit straw
trimmed with apricot silk gauze and blowaways; Mrs.
Aronson wore apretty gown in India-red cloth with whipped
flounce round the feet of black lace basque of black lace
and small black bonnet; Mrs. Alfred Cape, fawn poplin
with black lace visite ; Signora Majeroni, who looked
very ill, bronze-green silk skirt and bronze-green velvet
bodice, toque hat en suite ; Mrs. Gray, black poplin with
bands of black cord guipure over white silk, bonnet in
black jet and feathers ; Mrs. J. H. Carruthcrs, white silk
with chiffon ruffles, white feathered hat; Mrs. Alfred de
Lissa, floral gown with relOvements of caruhia satin, toque
of scarlet poppies; Miss Burdett-Smith, grey; Miss
Nellie Hill, fawn cloth combined with broken checks en
suite, and dozens more. There were lots of men present
(one unhappy creature, haunted, perhaps, by thoughts of
the Governor’s levee, came in full evening dress), and it
was lovely to see the groundlings nudge one another
when the captain of the German warship in port kissed
Lady Jersey’s hand in foreign style.
Why do the “ galloway ” women take so frantically to
fashions which are death to them ? At the Jersey recep-
tion the other day some misguided females, about four
feet nothing longitudinally, came out confidently in the
new Long-Tom paletdt which leaves off half-way to one’s
knees, and makes anybody but a. lady lamp-post look like
a walking trunk. No short woman should wear a long
jacket, no matter how modish she thinks it to be, for,
after all, what is it we most admire? Not fashion
but fashion when it becomes the wearer. Short women
shouldn’t wear lace basques either, which are the ne plus
ultra of style at present, unless they are dying to look
like the fictitious Irish gentleman who wore his two legs
down to his knees.
Speaking of styles, it was remarked at Government
House that all the best-dressed people wore black head-
gear, no matter how gay their frocks were. There is
magic in such a topping-off, for a gown that seems to be
too garish for words is sobered down directly one gets on
a black bonnet. I was glad to see, too, that hair was very
discreetly dressed, and that torn-out birdsnests were only
observed on the crania of the Awful Brigade.
It reflected somewhat on the hospitality extended to
visitors at the recent Government House reception that a
great number of women present, after leaving the cere-
mony, made a bee-line for the ice-cream and coffee
down town. The Jerseys have yet to learn what a hungry,
lantern-jawed locust is the fat Sydney Government ’Ouse
haunter in the nodding bonnet and the hand-bag.
Is it true, the whisper so industriously circulated just
now, that the wife of a certain magnate is anxious to get
him afloat on the briny, so that he may be out of hear-
ing of cork-popping ? I have heard corks pop even on
a mail-steamer.
Apropos to voyages, I am told that while on the
journey out it was remarked that Lady Jersey was ex'
tremely attentive to her children, so much so that at first
some of the passenger's mistook her for a maid. Indeed,
one day early in the passage, as she was bringing a glass
of water to one of the girls, a fellow-passenger (who was
doubtless of the opinion that real countesses spend most
of their time in casting mediaeval sneers from under
diamond coronets at their serfs) spoke to her in the
familiar style in which it is probably his wont to address
maids. Nobody ever knew what answer he got, but he
was observed suddenly to turn the colour of boiled beet.
At the Federal banquet the other evening Lady Jersey
wore a trained gown of dark-green velvet embroidered in
gold with gold passementerie on the bodice and gorgeous
liamonds—the same gown that she wore qn her unhappy
visit to the Queen at Balmoral, when she had to stand in
the night air with uncovered shoulders (while Her
Majesty cooled off) and so caught the cold antecedent to
aer late severe illness.
A Sydney Women’s Union (not to be too precise) has
broken out in a fresh place. For instance, the presi-
dentess had been so terribly shocked at an advertisement
inserted in one of the papers by “two young ladies
wanting situations as barmaids,” that she immediately
wrote them a letter asking them to “ consider well before
they entered upon such a career.” This is all very
pious, of course, but uneducated women must earn their
living somehow, and I presume that the danger of the
barmaid’s calling depends very much upon the sort of
woman who engages in it. lam doubtful whether the
Union would carry its enthusiasm so far in the good cause
as to procure remunerative work of another kind for the
women in whom it takes such a loving, pen-and-ink
interest. But if society will peddle with sinful and
worldly “ads.,” it might leave the hounded-down Ilebes
alone and exert itself on behalf of the “ young widows’
who “ would receive one gentleman boarder,” and the
bachelors who are in need of “domesticated housekeepers
under 30.”
The ladies of the Melbourne Austral Salon were “at
home” on 27th ultimo, and received many visitors, in-
cluding quite a crowd of men. Snazelle was there in
full blast, and all sorts of people turned up, including
Lady Davies and Victor Daley. Mrs. Macdonald was the
receiving hostess of the occasion. The next excuse the
Salon has for indulging in another outbreak is a benefit
to Matilda Ashton, a blind girl who recently matriculated
and is now anxious to gain a degree.
Women are not at all enthusiastic over the Federation
Convention. Those of them who know anything about
the matter are afraid of losing Governors and Governors’
wives of the present pattern and getting instead one
grand Panjandrum of a Governor-General. This would
be all very well for those living at the Capitol, but
how would society “ hum ” for those who didn’t ?
Only one guest turned up at the Federation feed in un_
dress costume, and that was the member for Paddington.
Said a notoriously hard-up swell who seemed hurt at the
absence of boiled shirt in Alfred’s appearance: “You
can’t g 6 into sassiety much if you haven’t a dress-soot.”
“ But at any rate this one is paid for,” retorted the Pad-
dington poet.
I have often wondered how travellers by train, unfor-
tunate enough to get into the same compartment as the
honeymoon couple who are made targets for old boots
and things from the platform, managed to escape so fre-
quently without a black-eye and their ears full of rice.
They do not always get off scot-free, for I remember one
such occasion when a large and irascible male passenger
with no sympathy for the joyousness of the proceedings
and who had received a cut from the heel of a hurtling
shoe, stood at the window and shook both fists at the
hilarious wedding-part} 7 , vowing he’d bring an action for
battery against the whole of them. It is probably in
the interest of law and order that the Mudgee station-
master has put his foot down and declined to allow wed-
ding guests to pelt things at the ’appy pair in the train,
and so the floating railway population has no need to
seek refuge under the seat when a wedding-party comes
aboard at that particular stopping-place.
It must be a true saying that a woman is just as old as
she feels. If not, how could this happen ? A maiden
lady on the shady side of 70, residing at North Shore,
invited a young lad who lived next door to help her nail
up a creeper on the verandah-post. The business done,
the boy was, in the most natural manner, following the
lady into the house, when the latter, in stern tones,
turned upon him with —“ No, Robert, not a step further.
People will talk, you know !”
Apropos of advts. : An old-clo'lady announces in the
dailies that she is the purchaser of “ old artificial teeth.’
These, of course, she polishes up and soils to the dentists
at a “ sacrifice,” and then the sassiety lady, who has her
fangs torn out because they are so uneven, my dear, gets
a nice new set which were originally the property cf a
Goulburn-street typhoid-fever corpse. Ugh !
On dit that the next marriageable daughter in a Sydney
family of girls who, from a society point of view, have
been very fortunate matrimonially, has received an offer
from a titled aide-de-camp attached to a neighbouring
vice-regal “ court.” The matter is being kept very much
under the rose by the parties concerned, and some say
that the bold girl has had the rashness to refuse him.
A characteristically Australian incident happened at
the Jersey reception. When the paid artillerymen on
duty in the ball-room were set at liberty they were seen
shaking hands with and conversing with one or two of the
ladies present. They were probably sisters or sweethearts
or something of our bold stipendiary defenders; but
what must Lady Jersey have thought of them, coming as
she does, fresh from a land where no respectable woman
is ever seen on the same side of the street as Thomas
Atkins ! Vide Rudyard Kipling on this subject.
Yours affectionately,
SAPPHO SMITH.
Nature and art conspired to make the Sydney Lieder-
taefel’s serenade of Governor and Lady Jersey the other
evening a thing to remember. The night was cool, starlit,
calm and balmy, and the singers seemed to have drunk
deep of its beauty and become permeated with its spirit
ere unburdening their souls of melody. The only fly in
the ointment was the extraordinarily fulsome speech
made by that enthusiastic courtier, Sir Patrick Jennings.
Lord Jersey’s reply was brief, manly, and modest.
Charles Huenerbein is again to the fore with three
morceaux characterisques : “ Consolation,” a tender
wistful arpeggio melody ; “ The Dream,” a lulling,
plaintive strain with soft slumbrous chords for the right
hand, with the theme for the left. “ Regret” is another
of Mr. Huenerbein’s compositions, and so is “Gavotte”
to be “ dedicated to my favourite pupil.” They will be
published shortly, and are sure to have a great drawing-
room run.
The marriage of Miss Mabel Kirby, step-daughter of the
late Mr. E. T. Waters, sometime editor of the EvKXiyo
News, with Mr. Carter, of the 8.N.Z., took place at St.
James’, Sydney, on 4th inst. The bride wore a travelling-
dress of old rose cashmere trimmed with Oriental em-
broidery, small bonnet en suite, and was attended by her
sister, Miss Grade Kirby, in cornflower blue. The break-
fast was held at the residence of the bride’s uncle,
Woollahra.
Mayor and Mrs. Burdekin have secured cabins in the

A Turf Conundrum.
The Bulletin must plead guilty to the rather
common crime of publishing hopelessly bad tips for the
Newmarket Handicap and Australian Cup. To pick the
winner of a six-furlong scramble from a field of thirty-six
is, indeed, a job so difficult that it excuses failure,
especially when the attempt has to be made several days
before the event. But in dealing with a race like this
year’s Australian Cup, a “prophet,” having a quantity of
past facts and figures to work upon, should be able to
give some specious explanation of a ghastly error. The
Bulletin named Enuc as a likely winner, and also went
so far as to include Vengeance amongst a lot that had no
show, “on paper,” of doing the trick. Such conduct
calls for an apology. Vengeance, several times beaten in
moderate company, had won but one, race-viz., the
Caulfield Cup—previous to this last Flemington meeting.
At Caulfield he was receiving two pounds from a com-
moner like Loyalstone, who ran him to a short head. It
was not a brilliant victory. The two horses laboured
down the straight, stride for stride, and at the finish they
were being rapidly overtaken by little Enuc, who had
seemed altogether out of the fun 250 yards from the
judge’s box. On that Caulfield Cup performance The
Bulletin assumed that neither Vengeance nor Loyalstone
(equal on “form”) was likely to win the Melbourne Cup
over an extra half-mile of ground, and in the longer race,
as everybody knows, they were both handsomely beaten
by Enuc, who then finished on the quarters of Correze,
and about a length and a half behind Highborn—the lot
being donkey-licked by Carbine.
# * *
Four days later Vengeance ran again in the
V.K.C; Handicap of IJmiles, meeting Correze and Enuc
on their Melbourne Cup terms, or thereabouts. The two
three-year-olds confirmed the previous “form” by run-
ning first and second, Vengeance finishing fourth. Up to
then there was nothing more evident than that Vengeance
had no pretensions to be called a “good Tin,” and cer-
tainly no claim to be regarded as a stayer. As a five-year-
old he would scarcely develops much bone and sinew
within the next four months, whilst the youngsters, in
the natural course of things, would improve at least a
stone.
# * *
As the Caulfield Cup was run, it seemed that
Vengeance was lucky to beat Enuc at all, at a difference
of five pounds in the latter’s favour. So much for the
apparent relative merits of the two horses over an easy
14 miles. Over 2 miles (Melbourne Cup) Euue gets 17
pounds from the other and loses him. Again over
miles Enuc receives 141 b. and beats Vengeance
by some three* lengths or so the Enuc and
Correze running in the two races being noticeably
consistent. These youngsters have four months in
which to acquire more muscle and stamina before meet-
ing the already matured Vengeance over a 2 j-mile course,
and they have much the better of the handicap with
their old opponent. Sticking to the case of Enuc we find
that he receives 91b. in the Australian Cup, or only 511).
less than Vengeance so completely failed to give him in
the V.K.C. Handicap of last spring.
# #
But neither Enuc nor Correze has a ghost of
look-in at any point of the Australian Cup, whilst Ven-
geance gets heme from Highborn. Vengeance is meet-
ing the runner-up to Carbine with an advantage of
231 b, as compared with the Melbourne Cup weights,
consequently they run somewhat according to “form,”
or what would have seemed like “ form ” had Vengeance
been already a proved stayer. But this fact merely com-
plicates the puzzle. Highborn, who is also a five-year-old
and past his growing days, meets Enuc and Correze on
151 b. and 121 b. worse terms than he did when they
finished right up against him in November. In short,
Highborn runs quite a 2 stone better horse than one
three-year-old who was third in the Melbourne Cup, and
another who was third in (he Caulfield Cup and Legcr.
We have seen Carbine give Highborn 4 stone (all but
31b.) and a tremendous bearing. How, then, are Correze
and Enuc to be handicapped with Carbine next season ?
Melbourne Herald's racing reporter was carried
away by his feelings last Thursday, when lie-wired : “The
geiu'ation of the day was the winning of the Autumn
Handicap in such a sennaiwnal manner by such a sensa-
tional horse as Marvel.” But m particular sensation was
experienced by the general public, who, for the most pait,
didn’t hear these all /gcd offers of 100 to 2 against the
long-boltled-up animal, and failed lo perceive that he
“ overpowered his jockey.” In truth, the whole business
seemed legitimate enough this time. Clever people
started by .airing 10 to 1 about Marvel, the price grajna. y
shortening to “ sixes.” Any subsequent knocking-cut of
the horse was apparently caused by one or two book-
makers thinking they knew something when they rca'ly
knew nothing. In the race Man el was allowed to make
tlie best of his way round, fairly close to the lads all the
time, and when he had gallantly led the procession past
the winning-post there seemed to be plenty of hackers’
tickets presented for payment.
# # *
Everything smells pure auel whole'ome in any
race that Carbine starts for, and the very punters who
have invested a trifle on one ot his opponents, just on the
off-chance, are ready with a magnanimous cheer when
Donald Wallace’s wonder comes in as usual. The demon-
stration on Champion day w as a repetition, mi a-smaller
scale, of the Melbourne Cup furore, and th aeing world
wore a bright, happy, almost honest aspect as gord old
Carbine returned to scale. You didn’t bear anyone
cursing his luck because be had wasted it sovereign over
The Admiral or Wbimbrel. The “ books ” accept the
\ ictories of “ Old Bay-over ” (as they call the great horse)
in a pleasant sort of way, for they have left off gambling
against him in weight-for-age races. A halo of sanctity
shines around Carbine’s not very handsome head. He
has never been “ milked” on the betting-market. If lie
isn’t intended to run for a race be is scratched at the
earliest opportunity, and be has never been the hero of
“ mysterious movements,” or a question of the money
being all right. He runs to win, and does w n, as many
as sixteen times in succession. It is supposed that a
jockey who attempted to “ pull” Carbine would imme-
diately fall dead from the saddle, and that the horse
would then pick up the corpse with his teeth and get
there all the same. He represents all that is excellent,
honest and plucky in horseflesh and Turf politics. He
will be the golden legend of the racing future, and-well,
God bless him, and take care of his c-cracked heel ! The
writer has broken down under his load of genuine emo-
tion.
# # #
A delay in hoisting tho “ all right ” flag after the
Australian Cup caused some innocents to suppose that
the V.R.C. stewards were politely requesting the ow ner of
Vengeance to give some explanation of that animal’s in-
and-out performances. Not that anyone supposes the
owner has much to do with such matters. Nor the trainer
nor jockey. They merely back the horse when he is
“well,” and tell their friends to do likewise, and the
horse—barring Ins Melbourne Cup failure—has always
won on those occasions.
# # *
This season’s three-year-olds must be a bad lot.
The Admiral, after beating Megaphone at Caulfield, just
manages to “do” Magic Circle in the V.K.C. Derby.
Then an unknown mare named Litigant heats Magic
Circle easily. Anon, Gibraltar beats The Admiral, after
which Gatling, w ho once ran Gibraltar to a head, comes
in a poor third for a Maiden Plate. Finally Megaphone,
who on previous handicap running, is the best youngster
of his year, gets beaten at nearly level weights hy a horse
(Highborn) that couldn’t touch Carbine at 3st. 111 b.
Trident, Carlyon, or even Dreadnought, would have
romped in for last Australian Cup as three-year-olds
carrying Megaphone’s weight.
* * *
How can punters hope to do any good when
many of the “books” are ignorant as to the unmistak-
able'“cronkness” of a prominent/aroimfe? For one of
the races at Flemington a certain horse w f as backed (by
the unfortunate public) until most of the ready-money
ringmen would lay no more. They went so far as to back
the horse “in” with brethren who had a little “ Xxx
money ” left on their volumes. Meanwhile, the trainer of
the horse in question was quietly shaking his head at.
friends who enquired by signs as to whether “it was all
right,” and candidly telling acquaintances that he didn’t
fancy anything. When the flag fell Xxx, whose jockey
had never moved in any of tho false starts, “ got badly
away,” and not till then did the “ books,” or most of
them, know that they had been afraid of a regular
“ stilt ’un.”
• # *
Phin. Thompson, the Sydney tobacconist, was
fined £lOO the other day for running a totalisator. Now,
as Fhin. bad about £3500 in his “tote” on tho New-
market Handicap alone (oommis.su n, say .£350), he can
afford to pay £lOO once in a way. How is it, let us ask,
that a square totalisator man ■ 'hi d <lOO while the
square consultation men are i..-red with and the
bookmakers are allowed to i u . shout the odds at
Rand wick course ? The hookmalui's odds are 5 to 2 or
less on a race where the totalisator gives 3 to 1 or more,
and the man who invests on the totalisator gets a chance
for second and third money, while the bookmaker gives
no second or third money. Mo wonder jthe influential
bookmaker sets the police on to the totalisator man.

The PEERLESS HAMMERLESS GUN is
our latest offer to the Colonial public and the

HARD HITTER, and for general utility, equal to
guns costing TEN POUNDS or more. Can only
be bought direct from us, or our authorised
agents. Very finely finished, browned barret,
and walnut stock, with steel heel-plate, perfect
ejectors, and hammerless action, lateral breech,
no awkward breaking gear, can be loaded

These guns could never be sold for double
the amount, if it were not that we wish them
to be a great advertisement for us.
THOUSANDS ARE NOW IN USE IN ENGLAND.
Hammerless guns are fast displacing the old
style, for the reason that the absence of hammers
is safer, offering no obstacle to catch in bush,
&c., to send gun off accidentally, and also
affording a quicker sight, which is very essen-
tial in snap shooting.
Specially adapted for Rabbit & Trap Shooting.
TWELVE BORE ONLY- SINGLE BARREL

The cheapest breechloader sold heretofore
was at least double the price of this gun, and
we say positively, much inferior.

of European manufacture and have formerly
been rifle barrels, and of quite as good quality of
metal as the most expensive gun in use, being
manufactured directly under government super-
vision, and only passed after most severe tests.
The boring and chambering have been done
with the one view of hard hitting and close
shooting. So simple and compact is the action,
that we assert it to be almost an impossibility
for them to get out of order.

“When Mr. Robertson and I were at school

Oswald Keatinge’s letter to his wife can
be construed in either of two ways : either that he
intended to commit suicide, or that he, finding
himself utterly crushed under such a sentence at
such an age, had determined to lie down and die.
It can only be construed as inevitably pointing to
suicide by people who don’t believe it possible for
an utterly broken man to give up the ghost after
the manner of the Marquesans, as described by
Robert Louis Stevenson,
There were extenuating circumstances
about Disraeli’s famous plagiarism of Thiers’
funeral speech on Marshal St, Oyr, in 1829,
for his eulogy of Wellington in 1852. Dizzy
brought it, m 1848, under the notice of Mr.
Smyth, a leader-writer on the Morning Chroni-
cle, and Smyth there reprinted it, or otherwise a
writer in the Globe, who exposed Disraeli’s pla-
giarism, would not have seen it. Smyth wrote to
the Times stating these facts.
H. P. Venables, many years secretary to
the Victorian Department of Education, died re-
cently in England. He was a genially-taciturn old
fossil, and was dismissed on Black Wednesday by
Berry and Co. The only interesting thing known
concerning the old man was that his department
once addressed as “ Stewart,” a proud citizen who
spelt his name “Stuart,” whereupon the offended
scion of royalty in writing back addressed Mr.
Venables as “ Mr. Vegetables.”
Colonel Mundy, writing in 1852 of Dr
Lang and his opposition to transportation, says :
The speeches of this gentleman and his colleagues—one
of whom, by the bye, was a retailer of rocking-horses and
radicalism in prose and verse according to the require-
ments of the market —teemed with vulgar personalities
against the Governor and his advisers.
If the Colonel happens to be still alive he will be
no less surprised than pleased to know how little
of radicalism there is in the whilom vendor of
rocking-horses. Also, how agreeable Sir Henry
tries to make himself to the Governors and
governoresses.
A wonderful old Australian of the Sir
George Grey stamp arrived in Sydney last week
on a short trip, in the person of Commander
Crawford Pasco, R.N., a septuagenarian, who has

The veteran—a son, by the way, of Nelson’s flag-
lieutenant who hoisted the famous signal at
Trafalgar first visited Sydney with H.M.S.
Beagle in the “Thirties,” Darwin, the immortal
scientific investigator, being the naturalist. Cap-
tain Pasco’s personal knowledge of the Australias
embraces the men and affairs of the whole inter-
vening period.
A portrait in oils of the late Peter Lalor
has been painted to the order of his son, Dr. Lalor,
for presentation to Ballarat Art Gallery. The
artist, Mr. Tennyson Cole, had to work from a
photo, of the Eureka hero, whose loss of an arm
was unfortunately concealed by his pose for the
original sitting. As Melbourne Herald intelli-
gently explains—“ This position shows all the
strength of the man physically, but hides from
sight the missing arm.” Which reminds us of the
Irishman who wore a shade over the eye that had
been gouged out and grew a heavy moustache to
conceal the teeth that Pat Mulligan punched
down his throat. The Irishman in question is
merely a creature of the writer’s fancy, but he does
very well as an illustration.

“ Lorrie ” Harnett, the burly Sergeant-at-
Arma of the N.S.W. Legislative Assembly, visit-
ing Wagga lately, was introduced to the Riverine
Club as an hon. member, and was jocularly
addressed by his intimate friends as “Sergeant.”
Whereupon one member who knew not “Lorrie,”
expressed the opinion that it was “most derogatory
to the club, that a d d Sergeant of Police from
Narandera or elsewhere should be brought into our
place like this.”
Rev. Doctor Charles Strong, giving his
ideas regarding the amelioration of poverty in
Melbourne, before the Charities Commission,
favoured the erection of People’s Homes a la Pea-
body’s Buildings, at the expense of either the
municipalities or by private enterprise. He
opined that the majority of half-starved toilers
were being scandalously sweated by their land-
lords. This is altogether too attenuated. Lower
the rent-charge, and then the capitalist will
gracefully lower the wage-rate, and things will
there and then revert to the status quo ante, only
that the standard of comfort will have suffered a
sensible diminution. If Doctor Strong had advo-
cated a rise in the remuneration of labour, he
would have been worthy of some commendation,
but as it is, he has got hold of the wrong end of
the stick.
Dear Bulletin, —The book-fiend is bad
enough, but how about that terror to women and
children, the “Hindoo” hawker? While I was
absent from home one called; seeing no man
about, he told my wife that she must buy. She
had 17s. 3d., but his manner of speaking frightened
her so much that she spent all her money in rub-
bish : nor would he close his basket until she had
proved, by turning the purse inside-out, that she
had no more. Considering that the stabbing and
murdering capabilities of these cheeky niggers
have been so often demonstrated in this country,
it is no wonder they are so widely feared by
women. There is another side to the insolence of
these vagrants, to which I cannot specifically
allude. They must “clear” from Australia, as
they are in many ways worse than the Chinese ;
their present license is, I presume, accorded them
by reason of the fact that they are “our fellow-
citizens ” under the benign reign of the grasping

Harry’s Girl.
(FOR THE BULLETIN.)
One could see that her forehead bore traces of care,
And tears fell like rain on her cheek—
A cheek like a peach-blossom, blushing and fair,
Half hid in a tangle of golden-brown hair —
She had not done it up for a week,
For trouble had come most unpleasantly near,
The station was seized by the bank,
And Harry’d been super, at ninety a year,
Together, of course, with the “run of his shear,”
And a lease of the Bongabong tank.
How bright was the future, until there was cast
This shadow of doubt on their track.
How wearily, drearily, moments dragged past,
And she sighed as she said to her pillow at last:
“ Will those bankers give Harry the sack ? ”
How sad broke the morning, the dew-drops of
pearl
Were tears for the pair who must pack.
But, ah ! comes a horseman—her head’s in a whirl,
And she falls on his breast just the happiest girl,
For they’d not given Harry “ the sack.”

Sir Thomas MHlwraith lives at a lovely
spot called “ Auchenflower,” a mile-and-a-half
from Brisbane on the Western railway. In the
days when the political life of Queensland was
embittered by the Steel Rails controversy, some
of the railway-guards referred—-among themselves
—to Auchenflower as the “ Steel Rails station.”
One evening a train was leaving the Brisbane
station. A member of Sir Thomas’s household
told the guard to “stop at Auchenflower.” In a
vacant moment the guard called out to the engine-
driver, in a voice heard all along the platform,
“ Stop at Steel Rails !” And the next mdrning
that guard received a polite but decisive intima-
tion that his valuable services were not absolutely
essential to the successful working of the
Queensland railways. And all the other guards
burned the word “ Auchenflower ” deeply into the
wooden tablets of their official memory.

Eighteen miles from Ipswich resides a
well-known settler, R. W. Le Grand, J.P., on
his estate of Wooyumboong. Le Grand is a
remarkable man to whom more extended refer-
ence will be made in a future chapter. At pre-
sent I have merely to mention that he has a
Teutonic neighbour whom we shall call Joseph
Coop. Coop came over to Le Grand to inform
him that his brother, who lived at Nijirk, in
America, had removed to Shakkeezahoo with all
his family. Their names brought Le Grand up
with a round turn. “ Veil! you knows not your
shography,” said Coop. But the brother's letter
being produced explained the conundrum by re-
vealing Nijirk and Shakkeezahoo as New York
and Chicago.
# * #
Another Teuton called in one day with a
wild look in his eye and a tomahawk in his right
hand. “ Goot mormng, Missa Le Grand ! De
beoples say you vas calls me von tarn schoundrel,
and never I likes it!” “ And what man dares to
say you are not ?” said Le Grand with a bland
smile. “ Ah, veil, ven you ’pologise like that,
never I minds it! Goot morning, Missa Le
Grand !” and he walked contentedly away with
the tomahawk.

Doubtless many Queensland students of
human nature have noticed, during the past five
years, the number of handsome women deliberately
sacrificed, or self-immolated, on the altar of Mam-
mon. The spectacle of Beauty and the Beast is
common enough anywhere on this planet, and
painfully conspicuous in Queensland simply by
reason of the small population. Every year
beautiful girls, urged by unscrupulous mothers or
their own overpowering vanity and ignoble ambi-
tion, are handed over to men old enough to be
their fathers, or to moneyed imbeciles or worthless
blackguards who possess wealth, or are the heirs
of wealthy fathers. These unhappy women are
doomed to a worse fate than those who slid down
the sloping arms of the Carthaginian Moloch into
the fiery furnace, or were given to the sea monster
to whom Andromeda was exposed to conciliate
Neptune. “We are creating,” says Carlyle, “an
aristocracy of the Money Bags; surely the basest
aristocracy yet known ! ” And yet, to join the
gaudy circle of soulless Mammon worshippers,
some of the fairest daughters of the people resign
themselves as wives to the embraces of notorious
fools, and equally notorious libertines! Is the
Australian mother who connives at these degrad-
ing sacrifices at all superior to the Indian matron
w r ho consigns her fairest daughter as a propitiatory
offering to the crocodile of the Ganges ?
# # #
Wherein, after all, lies the superiority—as
contra-distinguished from the status of the common
woman of the streets —of the moral condition of
the woman who sells herself, or is sold by her
parents, to some man or other, simply because he
happens to be rich ? It lies, dear friends, in this :
that the woman who sells herself for money to a
rich husband is sold wholesale, whereas the
“common” woman of the streets is sold retail.
Society regards wholesale trade as comparatively
respectable, whereas all retail businesses are low.

In one of the public offices up North is an
official who, under religious monomania, occa-
sionally believes himself to be the Saviour of
mankind. I remember seeing him some years ago
in the crowded gallery of the Legislative Council
during the delivery of the Governor’s Speech.
At the conclusion, in the midst of a solemn
silence, he exclaimed in a loud voice—“ Not a
single word about poor Jesus Christ!” Few people
know that this eccentric official has a handsome
and very estimable sister, who in her maiden
days was courted by a young man, who is now
one of the leading Australian statesmen. He
asked her to be his wife and she refused him, but
that is no reflection on anybody, as there are
many women who would refuse the best man in
this world. And ever since, that statesman’s
heart has been “darkened by her shadow,” and
the only consolation is the fact that he, at least,
escaped a brother-in-law who would have been a
permanent and unendurable calamity.

The next Queensland session will doubt-
less be one of the liveliest on record. If my
classical memory is correct, a gentleman named
Ephialtes was the solitary traitor at Ther-
mopylae. There are several worthy of that name
on the Ministerial Benches, but the Ministry are
are not at all anxious on their account. The fact
is that some of the Government supporters will
make any sacrifice to the dread of their con-
stituents and the fear of losing their £3OO per
annum. They will rise and make those saaly
prevalent political speeches embodying
The plain, ,lunt show of briefly-spoken seeming
Which hides the bloodless heart’s sole hardened
scheming ;
but when their seats and salary are in danger
they will descend from the serene heights of
cloud-capped bunkum, like kites that have lost
their tails, and fall all in a heap, with the usual
kerswosh ! on the Ministerial side of the House
during a party division. So that even if a general
election is anticipated this year by both sides
there is still a reasonable belief that it is not at all
likely to come off.
MAROOGALINE
A NEW REMEDY FOR IRISH DIFFI-
CULTIES.
A leading Dublin paper, having heard so much
said in both the Irish and English press in favor
of a wonderful oil, determined to investigate the
matter by personal interviews with people who
had used it, in order, to learn whether or not one
half that was said of its magical power was true,
or whether it was one of those gigantic advertising
schemes the magnitude of which in them modern
times fairly takes one’s breath away. Its represent-
ative interviewed a number of people in various
parts of Ireland who have been cured by the
application of the oil, and in every instance he
found that the published statements were true
and correct in every particular. Everywhere
people where enthusiastic in its praise.
A captain of the Royal Irish Fusiliers, who had
suffered long from rheumatism and sprained ankle,
said : “ The effect after three applications of St.
Jacobs Oil was simply marvellous; the pain at
once departed, and has never returned.”
A prominent hotel proprietor, after suffering
years from rheumatic gout, said : “It would be
hard to conceive of anything working a cure so
rapidly as St. Jacobs Oil did in my case.”
A sergeant of the Royal Irish Constabulary
told of a friend who had been a great sufferer for
years with rheumatism in the back, suffering
great pain. Using two bottles of St. Jacobs Oil,
the pain entirely disappeared, and never returned.
A young woman in Castlebar told the reporter
of the almost miraculous cure which her mother,
aged 70 years, had experienced from using the
invaluable St. Jacobs Oil. She had been almost
helpless for two years from rheumatism, and was
completely cured by using less than one bottle of
the oil.
A prominent surgeon in Tipperary related the
case of a parish priest who had for a long time
suffered the most intense agony from sciatica,
completely cured in three days by rubbing him-
self well with St. Jacobs Oil.
A very enthusiastic Irishman in Oort was met
with, shouting “Long live St. Jacobs Oil.” He
had suffered the most intense rheumatic pains for
years, and was cured by using the contents of one
bottle of the oil.
A cooper in Beale, County Kerry, Ireland,
related how his knee was twice its natural siz°,
stiff, and painful, and he was unable to stand ;
swelling and pain entirely disappeared after using
St. Jacobs Oil one week.
An old gentleman in Mallow, was cured in one
week after having commenced the use of St.
Jacobs Oil, of severe rheumatism of six years’
standing.
On returning to Dublin, the reporter called on
some of the leading chemists, for the purpose of
learning their views. Messrs. R. Simpson and
Co., of 16, Henry-street, the well-known chemists,
stated that St. Jacobs Oil was the most popular
remedy now being sold ; that it is no uncommon
thing for them to sell 1200 bottles of the oil in a
single week. That their last order was for 600
dozen, or 7200 bottles, and you can rest assured,
said Mr. Simpson, the senior partner, that no
medicine would have this enormous sale unless it
possessed actual merit.
PRACTICAL PHILANTHROPISTS.
THE blessings of peace and industry are
found in the advance of civilisation and
the development of resources—whether the latter
be of mental or mechanical evolution. They
who add to the conveniences of living, to the
education of the masses, accomplish something
more than a mere striving for riches —a fact
which cannot be gainsaid. Therefore the develop-
ment of an improved farming utensil is a bene-
faction to the community at large as well as a
source of profit to its originator. In connection
with this we may assume that any manufacture of
an article which tends to elevate the condition of
the masses bears the stamp of genuine merit, and
deserves attention other than that of mere com-
mercial interest. Accepting such reasoning for a
basis of fact, we believe none can gainsay the
claim of the Waterbury Watch Company to be
considered practical philanthropists, inasmuch as
by the production of an accurate, reliable and
timekeeping watch, at a price within the means
of every industrious person, they have already
educated large masses of people to a realising sense
of the value of time, and, besides, are daily and
hourly teaching youths and adults of both sexes
the necessity of punctuality, and the assurance of
possible and probable success in the future, when
they shall heed the passing moments, and utilise
them in accordance with the warning hands of
their faithful watches.

Female Suffrage: The Matter
Summed Up.
Dear Bulletin,— From the tendings of certain
social undercurrents it seems very probable that
before long an agitation will be inaugurated on a
large scale to allot to women similar political
rights to those at present possessed by men.
Dander these circumstances, therefore, it is as well
to consider whether, when the critical time comes,
such an extension of the voting power will be
advisable in the interests of humanity. Examin-
ing the relative proportions of the sexes, we find
that from time immemorial in all communities
there has existed approximately one man to one
woman, and that the percentage of males to
females in most populations is about equal.
That this-results from purely natural and not
artificial causes is obvious, and just as nature
oi’dains that the earth cannot bring into existence
more children than she can support, so will she
provide against any undue disproportion of the
two sexes. Assuming that the principle of One
Man One Vote obtain in all its purity, for every
male vote recorded there must accompany it
one female vote indirectly expressed through
the medium of. the male. Although man
has shown a decided inclination to legislate from
a class point of view, and to lay certain sections
of outside "classes under unfair disabilities, it
remains yet to be seen that he is willing to vote to
the prejudice of the opposite sex only, and it is
worthy of note that the wrongs from which the
females of the poorer classes suffer to-day are the
fruits of sinister operations directed not against
their sex alone, but against a whole class of people
comprising both males and females. A man is
not likely to vote against his own interests, and as
his comfort depends materially upon the happi-
ness of his indispensable female partner, it is cer-
tainly presumable that on all questions of general
policy the interests of both sexes will receive abso-
lutely mutual and impartial treatment. As men
must certainly have had mothers, and as the
majority possess, in addition, sisters, other female
blood relations, and, possibly, wives and
daughters, when a man goes to the poll to
record his vote it is hardly probable that
the known sentiments of his female connections
will not contribute largely towards fashioning his
political creeds, and, bearing in mind the powerful
influence which the • female exercises over the
male towards good or evil, the only apparent
danger in the present system of electoral dis-
pensation lies in the women having not too little
but too much social power.
* * #
Reviewing the few institutions in the Aus-
tralias whefein women have had the entire
administrative executive control it cannot be
declared that they have proved a remarkable
success! The patients at the women’s hospitals
complain that they have to put up with unneces-
sary humiliations and frivolous vexations which
would never occur in establishments directed by
men. As a servant, woman is facile princeps,
but as a master, she is a miserable
failure. No fault can be found with the
Victorian Civil Service employes as servants.
In fact, it is asserted that they are better clerks
than men would be. As that matter is not worth
arguing it may pass, the subject under enquiry
being the capacity of woman to conduct the
national affairs ab ovo ad infinitum. One of the
worst features about female education is the
sedulous cultivation of domestic hypocrisy. A
girl is taught to conceal her true feelings and
assume a mechanical puritanism which under-
mines her notions of what is true and false. As a
rule a woman will have a more sympathetic heart-
than man, but as her sympathy-wastes itself
chiefly on unworthy objects this advantage more
frequently than not proves rather a curse than a
blessing. To-day when priests, royalists and
other useless persons are on their final trial it
would hardly do to confer electoral privi-
leges on that sex by whose influence alone
the undesirable sections of society are per-
mitted to exist. The complexity of female
character renders her less efficient in action,
and the result of this is that her procedure is
invariably accompanied by tokens of irresolution,
vagary, and other signs of incapacity. An
emotionalist rather than a philosopher, an indivi-
dualist rather than an altruist, what else can be
expected but disaster if woman be granted com-
plete enfranchisement so long as her education be
conducted on the present ridiculous lines?
# * *
Physiologists assert that a marked deprecia-
tion is noticeable in the offspring of those farm-'
lies in which it has been the custom to educate
the females to the level of bluestockings. The
perfection of mental capacities in the mother is
gained at the cost of her physical attributes.
Further, it is very rarely that the brain virtues of
the mother will be reproduced in her offspring*
but her bodily vigour will invariably determine
the vigour of her children. With the father, the
case is diametrically the reverse. Accordingly, if
this be so, it is simple suicide to develop a high
standard of female education, since no possible
benefit can accrue to society thereby. A less con-
fined system of athleticism is what woman
requires, and men who are physically adapted for
the arduous exertions of politics or manual labour
or book-worming researches can be safely per-
mitted to discharge the external functions of
voting humanity, while woman internally directs
the show from her imperium in impeHo.
* * *
Surely no sane woman would desire for her
sex the privilege of competing with man on
the. hustings, in the halls of Parliament and of
Justice, in public offices, or in his everyday toil
on even terms ? When once the distinctive
features between the sexes are destroyed then
farewell to half of the salt of life. Woman's
world is not man’s world; they are separ-
ate kingdoms, which it would be nescient
folly to endeavour to assimilate. Half .the
attraction between the sexes lies in the op--
posing qualities possessed by each. Dissimi-
larity of characteristics proves often the strongest
bond of union between husband and wife. No one
would desire to see woman transformed into a
male female,” yet this is what apparently may
happen unless the present system of competitive
life gives place to co-operation, when women will
have no need to emulate the deeds of men to earn
a bare subsistence. For the present it is sufficient
that man should be the protector, and woman the
consoling angej, of daily life. By-and-bye, when
a healthier tone of female education develops a
more rational flow of thought* when the enjoy-
ment of material prosperity is secured to all under
a better system of social arrangements, then, with
a mind more virile and an organisation more effi-
ciently developed, it may safely be granted to
woman to perform her share at the ballot-box. As
matters stand to-day her claim to do so is open to
every objection.

but a few months married.
Ex-Attorney-General Shiels, of Victoria,
who had been acting as emergency-man at the
Convention in Wrixon’s absence, discovered what
a huge tactical mistake he had made in not seizing
an opportunity to speak, when J. P. Abbott, on
Monday morning, insisted that he (S.) should
leave the Convention now that Wrixon had
arrived. It was urged on Shiels’ behalf that he
should be allowed to remain without voting, as he
was Premier Munro’s legal adviser and only
colleague, whereupon Abbott grimly retorted that
there were plenty of rooms in Parliament House
wherein Shiels could advise Munro. Exit Shiels.
A S.A. Minister has been left in Adelaide
in charge of several portfolios in addition to his
own during the absence in Sydney of other Minis-
ters as delegates to the Federation Convention.
A reporter found him iu the Sealing-wax office,
and sought to elicit some information relating to
the Turnip Department. Drawing himself up to
his fullest official height, the Minister said
severely : “Harx me nothink about the Turnip
Department till I gets officially hinside it; this
’ere’s the Seaiing-wax Department, and it ain’t
hettikwet for a Sealing-wax Minister to diwulge
Turnip secrets behind the back of the Turnip
Minister.”
Adelaide is the latest aspirant to the
honour of being proclaimed the Federal Capital
of the yet unborn Unite 1 States of Australia.
The advocates of Adelaide’s advantages sum up
their alleged arguments thus :—Adelaide has a
cool climate (!), a central position (!), and is com-
mercially neutral; and South Australia is the
only colony whose boundaries touch those of every
other colony, while her railways will soon tap all
her borders. The agitation at present is a false
fire started by rent-boomers and land-fakirs.
Hundreds of s.marties who migrated from Adelaide
to Melbourne when “ the.Marvellous city effer-
vesced into a land-boom, and who scumm’d it
atop of the ferment, now find, their occupation
gone, and are scuttling back to Adelaide in the
hope that the same winning game may be; repeated
there. Rents have already gonc.np in ( lie City of
Churchesncarly 100 per cent. On the frothiest expec-
tations. . ..
The Assam Blend has stood the test of 10 years-
Speaking at the Postal Conference Dan
O’Connor stumbled in his Oirish way on a pretty
good definition of Parkes’latest scheme for self-
advertisement. when he said—“ If there was (sic)
any real pretence of Federation among them,” &c.
A young Sydney pressman went into the
Federation banquet on the ticket sent to the
editor of a Melbourne paper. He was loudly
announced “The editor of the Melbourne
Sossitchwrap.” Premier Parkes looked round
hastily, gripped his hand warmly—that is warmly
for Parkes —and said effusively, “ Glad to see you,
my dear sir, Melbourne for ever ! ”
Melbourne Leader reports that “Foxes
seem to be spreading in the Camperdown district;
one was killed by a young man named Langham.”
When ydu come to look at this carefully it would
appear that the young man must also have been
spreading, for there was as many of him as of the
fox. Jersey is spreading in exactly the same
way.
G. H. Reid has been cruel to Parkes, but
Cumberland Times has been even more cruel to
Reid. It unearthed a fragment of his block poetry
from the Evening News, which winds up with a
ghastly tetanus thus :
“ This harmony of force was easily understood,
By that first ’mong modern princes—Albert the Good ;
Bright harbinger of the restored, primeval plan,
That seeks the freedom yet the brotherhood of man.”
What have the Republican party to expect from
such a man ?
The Bulletin wonders what Mr. Ardill,
the professional Sydney philanthropist, means to
do about the many charges made against him in
the columns of the press. No more direct chal-
lenges have, within our knowledge, ever been made
to any public man. Should Mr. Ardill fail to
take prompt measures to reply to the damning
accusations so openly levelled against him, it will,
we repeat, plainly be the duty of the public to
withdraw all support from the many institutions
over which he presides.
Parkes is out of it as the “draw ”, at the
Convention. He is billed as “ star,” but the real
star is Sir Geore-e Grey. When the ex-Knight of
Kawau spoke on Monday he was most flatteringly
received, and during his speech there was not a
sound save his voice to be heard. The delegates,
the public in the galleries, and the press alike
hung delightedly on every word, and S’r’nry was
undone. There is a big difference between the
utterances of Grey and Parkes —all the difference
that there is between cultured and soft-spoken yet
fervid and moving speech and flimsy, florid flum-
mery with the eccentricities of aspirate peculiar
to the Domain and the Queen’s statue—all the
difference that there is between a silver bell and a
kerosene-tin. Parkes is not the silver bell, And
the trouble with him just now is that he knows it.
A Melbourne paper is startled by the dis-
covery that opossum-skins are commonly sent to
London to bo dressed, dyed and manufactured,
and then returned to Australia to be sold. Aren’t
Australian skins sent to London, together with
the bark used for tanning them, in order that
they may be returned as leather, or, worse still,
“English-made boots?” Australian wool, too,
comes back as Scotch tweed or West of England
cloth, and- they do say that a little Australian
wine i shipped to Europe that wo may jmport it
again,'after many days, as French claTet.. These
are troubles that a young country scon grows out
of. • ■■ • : ;; -6 •

SKETCHES FROM A LIFE OF ACTION.
(FOR THE BULLETIN.)
'V;
Sir George Grey had succumbed in the
struggle with the powers of Downing-street, but
An tarns-like sprang up the greater from his fall. It
was in defence of the people of New Zealand that
he had incurred the displeasure of the Crown and
aristocracy, and the vengeance taken by the
Colonial Office at once raised him to the highest
pinnacle of local popularity. Addresses were
showered upon him, and the people, as one man,
looked up to him as the champion of their rights
as members of a rising community. Other
Governors might be content to figure as puppets,
and to fill the part assigned by Bret Hart to
angels, by
“ Loafing around the Throne,”
but such a position was totally unsuited to Sir
George Grey’s character, and he was too manly
ever to have descended to the position.
Shortly after his recall, Sir George visited Eng-
land, and on his return to Kawau, devoted him-
self to literary pursuits. But in 1874 Air. Vogel’s
proposal to abolish the Provinces roused Sir
George to action. He looked upon the proposal
as equivalent to the destruction of the Constitu-
tion which he had taken so large a part in framing,
and was convinced that it would ultimately place
the land-legislation still rrore in the hands of
the land-grabbers and plutocrats. Under the
Provincial system, the land-laws of each province
were framed and administered by district govern--
ments, locally elected under a more liberal fran-
chise than that by which members of-the General
Assembly were returned. Moreover, this system
of local councils with semi-parliamentary powers
acted as a school for the instruction of the intelli-
gent in the knowledge of public affairs and
governmental duties, and had helped to make the
Maoriland Parliament itself a model for all Aus-
tralasian Governments.
Sir George, therefore, at once issued from his
retirement, and addressed an eloquent petition to
Mr. John Williamson, then Superintendent of the
Province of Auckland, urging that action should
be taken to prevent this wrong being done. This
petition was forwarded in due course to the Secre-
tary for the Colonies, Lord Carnarvon.
Mr. Williamson died soon after, and a deputa-
tion of Auckland electors at once waited on Sir
George Grey at Kawau, and begged him to allow
himself to be nominated as a candidate for the
Superintendency. He consented, and was elected
by acclamation, succeeding Mr. Williamson also
as. member for Auckland City West in the House
of Representatives.
Now commenced the grandest part of his career;
one which will fill the most brilliant pages of his
history when it comes to be written. It at once
became evident that a new power had entered the
political world. Possessing eloquence of the
highest order, he was capable of moving to burning
enthusiasm vast crowds, who hung upon his words
and followed him with the most implicit trust and
confidence.
Had the measure for the abolition of Provincial-
ism depended on outside opinion, its fate
was assured, for the mass of the people was
dead against it; but the House did not repre-
sent public opinion. It was elected for five years
under a limited franchise, and the districts were
so unequal that one member represented as many
as 1600 electors, while another represented 103
only—and so on.
In this unrepresentative House, Government,
Confident in its majority, succeeded in passing
the Bill, which became law in 1877.
Sir George now led an active agitation for par-
liamentary reform. Travelling all over the country
he axldressed in every centre crowded and en-
thusiastic meetings, and in these his glowing
oratory, the perfect independence of his position,
and his broad democratic sympathies gave him a
supreme hold over the people.
When Parliament met in 1877 after a dissolu-
tion, the effect of this campaign was at once
apparent, even under the blighting influence of a
restricted suffrage. Major (now Sir Harry)
Atkinson’s Ministry was defeated, and Sir George
Grey became Premier.
But, thanks to the constitution of the House,
the Premier’s majority was so small and so uncer-
tain that he could not carry any of the measures
of Reform for which he and his Ministry con-
tended. The landed party were also disgusted by
the imposition of a tax calculated on the unim-
proved value of land. And finally the rash and
irresponsible actions of Mr. Ballance, Colonial
Treasurer under the Grey administration, led to a
breach in the Ministerial ranks, Sir George being
at length compelled to insist on Mr. Ballance’s
withdrawal from the Ministry.
Under these troubles the Grey Ministry at
length succumbed. But though thus defeated as
a Minister, Grey continued as much a power as
ever, and even when not in office dragged the
Conservative party at his chariot wheels. His
successors in office found themselves compelled to
carry through all the measures of Parliamentary
Reform for which Sir George Grey continued as
vigorously as ever to contend. The duration of
Parliament was reduced from five years to three,
manhood suffrage was carried, electoral districts
were equalised ; and, finally, in 1889, Sir George
succeeded in carrying his great principle of One
Man One Vote — i.e.. that no elector is allowed to
have_ more than one vote at any Parliamentary
election. This carried, he retired from Parlia-
mentary life.
# # #
Sir George Grey also proved himself a
benefactor in other ways to at least two of the
nascent republics which he swayed as Governor.
At tire Cape ho founded a library which, in the
words of a leading English literary man in an
address on Libraries, given last year, would prove
a distinct loss to literature generally it by any
cause, such as fire, it should disappear. Not to
mention manuscripts, rare works, and first edi-
tions, this library contains the most valuable
collection of works on the philology of the
Southern Hemisphere in the whole world.
Sir George Grey, in talking of this Library
said : “ My idea was to get together all published
dictionaries, grammars, and Works in every
language and dialect of every country and Island
of the South Pacific, and, in fact, of the Southern
Hemisphere in order that students might there be
able to carry through the study of any language or
dialect that they might wish to acquire.
“ The British Museum was most anxious to
acquire this collection, and contended that it was
not fair that an out-of-the-way colony should
possess such a treasure. I offered to treat with
the Museum authorities for exchange of dupli-
catcd volumes in my collection for duplicated
volumes wanting in my library, and which they
possessed. They replied that an Act of Parlia-
rnent existed which prevented them from parting
with any volume which they had once acquired,
and there negotiations dropped.”
Sir George added that still greater displeasure
was manifested when it became known that the
most valued Dante manuscripts in the world,
containing notes and emendations in the great
poet’s own handwriting were in this library,
and it was actually proposed to get an Act
of Parliament passed with power to take one
of these manuscripts from the Cape and transfer
it to the British Museum ! “But,” said Sir
George, “better counsels prevailed, and the bill
was never introduced.”
Auckland, Maoriland, also, has been endowed
with a magnificent library, scarcely inferior to
that at the Cape, and also with a valuable gallery
of paintings, mostly by old masters; including a
Ratfaelle. Sir George Grey’s policy in respect to
these endowments may best be summed up in a
few words he let drop in connection with
some rare original manuscripts of the time of
Cromwell.
These consist of a treaty concluded by Richard
Cromwell in extension of one by his father with
the Hanseatic League, and a series of despatches
from Meadows, Secretary of the Council of State,
who was sent by Cromwell as ambassador to
Sweden in 1657 and 1658. Also a series of draft
reports in the hand of Thurloe.
Sir George said in respect of these : “ I was
told at the British Museum that there were none
of Meadows’ letters in the public records of the
United Kingdom, all having disappeared, and I
was earnestly pressed, on grounds of patriotism
and otherwise, to give these letters to swell the
Museum collection or the Record Office.
“I concluded, however, that there were in these
collections so many manuscripts of the highest
value; while documents of this nature were all but
unknown in the new countries springing into
nations under the impulse of British energy, that
it would be more equitable not to deprive New
Zealand of unpublished papers of such value.
“ Their influence might produce fruit, and call
into existence some historian in that new world at
the antipodes.”
We cannot close more appropriately than with
these words, which show the democratic bent of
tire Great Pro-Consul’s mind. From the time
that he was first called to rule over dependencies
of England, the one object of his rule was so to
direct the destinies of these dependencies as to
enable them worthily to take their place in history
as democratic nations.
In Liberalism, Maoriland now takes the lead ;
this is chiefly due to the noble example, bold
rule, and wise counsels of Sir George Grey.
The End.
In the happy Isle of Jersey, it has been
discovered that the libel law gives power to im-
prison a wife when her husband isn’t getatable.
A newspaper man there was ruined by the
damages in a libel suit, and as Jersey is an island
where they imprison a man indefinitely under
such conditions he wisely skipped. But the
aggrieved party hunted up an old statute bearing
pa the case, and cheerfully arrested the missing
publisher’s wife instead of himself. Jersey is a
nice place to federate with, taking it all round.
A Maoriland Idyll.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
The curtains of night drop down
On valleys and forests still,
And a mist drives up o’er the plains
To the shepherd’s hut on the hill.
On the mighty Alps in the w r est
The moonbeams fall and glow—
Where the mountains pierce the cold, calm Heaver*
With spears of eternal snow.
Prom a crag on the mountain
X he shepherd looks on the night,
And longs that the angels may scatter
Some rays of soul-wanning light.
He can only bind his broken heart
With a hope of the Great To Be.
Por the shepherd’s angel Sweetheart sleeps
In a churchyard over the sea.

When Chinamen “peg out” at the Tas-
manian Tin Mines they are not interred European
fashion, but to save time and expense are simply
thrown out into the scrub like other refuse to
mingle their corruption with the usual surround-
ings of a Chinese camping-ground.
The lentcrfield (N.S.W.) poundkeeper is
a man of the strictest integrity. “Dooty afore
perks ” is his motto. The other day he found
his own cow astray, so he impounded her;
entered the fees against himself ; paid them over
to himself; made the impoundee shout for the
poundkeeper, and then entered the whole as
“ transaction closed.”
A Bathurst (N.S.W.) man trained to-
Sydney 3i dozen cabbages and 16 ducks, for sale 1
by auction. r lhe auctioneer’s “account sales’”
showed that after losing the value of the goods he-
(the consignor) had to pay 7s. 6d. out of his pocket;
to free himself from the hammer-man’s debt.
Commission, freight and other charges had ex-
ceeded the selling total by three half-crowns;.
After this, who will deny the N.Z. theory that
the transit question underlies the labour-question?
Dear Bulletin,- —The overpowering train
of thought in the “ handsome piece of Broken
Bill skite,” quoted by you the other day, recalls
the execration of the German Jew, who had been
taken in for half-a-crown by a fellow-dealer
in old clothes: “I wish I had a thousand
towns, and in every town a thousand streets, and
in every street a thousand houses, and in every
house a thousand rooms, and in every room a
thousand beds, and that in every one of these
beds you would have to lie a thousand years with
the most horrible toothache.” This metaphor
does not yet appear to be known in Broken Hill,
or it would, ere now, have been used to express
the local ideas about the permanency of the lode.

CADBURY’S COCOA is closely allied to
milk in the large proportion of flesh-forming and
strength-sustaining elements that it contains. It is pre-
pared on the principle of excluding the superabundance
of fatty indigestible matter with which Cocoa abounds
—supplying a refined thin infusion of absolutely pure
Cocoa, exhilarating and refreshing, for Breakfast, Lun-
cheon, Tea or Supper, giving staying power and im-
parting new life and rigour to growing children, and
those of delicate constitutions.
One on the Jaw.
Dear Bulletin, —The chance notice of a para-
graph in one of the local papers the other day,
revived the memory of an incident nearly thirty
years old, of which 1 do not think any mention
has ever appeared in print. The paragraph merely
chronicled probate of the will of Elizabeth Bunt-
ing, widow, formerly an attendant at Kew Lunatic
Asylum, who died in November last, and it
attracted my attention by the desire expressed
in the will that her remains might be interred
in the grave of her late brother, John King
{who died in 1872), in the Melbourne Cemetery;
and for this purpose the sum of £5O was
■devoted by the will to cover the funeral ex-
penses. My story affords a quaint illustration
■of what may happen to a conscientious officer in
the discharge of his duty. John King was the
only survivor of that costly and ill-fated expedi-
tion led by Burks from Melbourne to the Gulf of
Carpentaria and back to Cooper’s Creek, where
Burke, Wills and Gray died of starvation in Aug.,
1861. King was rescued from amongst the blacks
six weeks afterwards by the party sent out under
Howitt, and the surveyor of that party, Edwin
J. Welch (whom you know) was sent down to
Melbourne in charge of King—who was in a very
weak state of health—from their depot camp at
Menindie, on the Darling River, with official
instruction “to proceed to Melbourne with all
available despatch, and hand J ohn King
over to the care of the Exploration Committee.”
There was great excitement in Melbourne over the
expected arrival, and when at last it was reported
that King had reached Woodend —then the ter-
minus of the railway—all the world and his wife
prepared to turn out and honour him with a re-
ception. A telegram was received from Welch
naming the hour of arrival, and the proper official
arrangements were made at Spencer-street railway
station, but the time passed and the train did not
come in. And then it was rumoured that
old Dr. Wills (father of one of the dead
explorers), acting on the instructions the
Governor, had stopped ■ the train at North
Melbourne station, and thence taken King home.
And the great large-hearted public howled its
discontent and tailed off in many directions, but
mostly to North Melbourne. I reached that
station just in time to hear Welch positively re-
fuse to give King up without a written order from
the Governor, or to allow him to leave the train at
that place. He said he had his instructions and
meant to sit there till they sent the train on. Old
Dr. Wills was in the carriage with Pond (of
Spiers and Pond), and Nash (Secretary for Rail-
ways) stood at the door arguing the point un-
availingly with Welch. The poor old Dr. was
under the combined influence of strong excite-
ment and something that was probably
red when he had last looked upon it.
Pond was engaged in the hopeless attempt
to get up a conversation with King, who
merely leant back in the corner of the carriage
and cried. “The line cannot be blocked any
longer,” said Nash; “the train must go cn to
Melbourne, and I shall send in a report to the
Minister.” “Report what you like, but send her
ahead,” came the reply ; and a few minutes after-
wards we drew up alongside the Spencer-street
platform, densely thronged with people, but all
arrangements tor the reception cancelled. How
they reached the old Government House in
William-street, packed on a “jingle,” through
that crowd has nothing to do with my story, but
John King and Welch were eventually safely
landed in one of the upstairs rooms and received
by the Gov.’s A.D.C., or secretary. King, in a
weak and fainting condition from over-excitement,
was placed on a sofa, and as a short interview
between Welch and Sir Henry Barkly was draw-
ing to a close a door on the opposite side of the
room opened, a tall, strongly-built and well-
developed female entered, followed by the old
Doctor in one of his most genial moods : —“That's
the man who refused to let me bring your brother
to you from North Melbourne, and if he dies you
will know whose fault it was.” “Are you the
man that had me brother in thethrain?” “I
am, madam, but— ” when a full-sized and
influential right-hander caught Welch on the
point of the jaw and upset him over
the end of the sofa. His Excellency
fled incontinently from the scene and dis-
appeared through the nearest door. Some
other official came in and helped to pick up the
debris, and the lady prostrated herself over the
partially inanimate body of her brother, and very
properly fainted. The excitement had run down.
Doctors Wilkie and Macadam arrived, and the
rescued man and his sister were driven to St.
Kilda by Sir William and Lady Don. Welch
used to say that he had to live on spoon-meat for
nearly a week after that meeting. Some of his
friends wanted him to summon the lady for
assault and subpoena the Governor as a witness,
but, whatever he may bo now, he was a loyal sub-
ject of the Crown in those days. Miss King after-
wards became Mrs. Bunting. If she hit Bunting
half as hard as she hit Welch, no wonder she was a
widow when she died.— An Old Melbourne
Fossil.
The Sorrows of a Sandwich Man.
His name was John Fosh ; his calling, sandwich-
man ; face grimy, eyes black and cavernous;
jaws lanterned, general appearance gaunt; frame
shivering with two coats on his back, afid a bundle
of something—shirts call it. Fosh was an old
soldier, and has had five years of odd jobbing—
window-cleaner, boardman, match-vendor, hawker,
and docker. He sticks to the boards when he can
get them. Fosh was dining on air and washing it
down with a lump of ice when I met him in the
Dark Arches formed by Charing Cross railway-
bridge. This is one of the favourite dining-rooms
of boardmen. If they have a herring and a chunk
of bread they bring it here. If- they have nothing,
like Fosh, they bring it here just the same, if
they have a penny to spare they buy a penn’orth
of pea-soup at the kitchen in Ham-yard. So I
understood Fosh to say.
“But, surely, Fosh, you have a penny over from
the day before ?”
“Not always. How is it when you don’t get no
boards for two days ? Where’s yer penny then ?
Where, indeed ?”
“ So some of you were run in the other day for
trespassing on the kerbstone ? ”
“ That’s so. And I’ve heard ’em say as they’ll
do away with us altogether. They told us this
morning that they’d pay no more fines.”
“ What does the law say ? ”
“The boardman must keep in the gutter.”
“ Then why don’t you ? ”
“ Why, the ’ansoras haims at us. They thinks
our toes is targits,” said Fosh grimly.
“ Then you take to the kerbstones ? ”
“ Ay, w'e takes to the kerbstones, and then the
pleeceman ’e comes up and warns us. And the
swells complain, and well, it’s the last job a
chap’ll take to.”
“ The last hope.”
“Ay. The very last.”
“ What pay do you get, Fosh ? ”
“ One-and-tuppence a day, from !) till 5.20.
And lucky them as gets a pair o’ boards. There’s
always a tight for ’em. I’ll tell you what it is.
There’s too many of us in this ’ere world.”
“ Well, how do you spend your oue-and-two-
pence?”
“Fourpence for a doss! Salvation Army,
Horseferry-road, a coffin bed and a leather blan-
ket ; but it’s warm enough, the room is, with
steam-pipes. At seven at night you goes in and
gets some coffee and a bit of bread. When you
goes out at seven in the morning you gets some
more coffee and a bit more bread. Them and the
doss is fourpence—and very good for the money.”
“ That’s only fourpence.”
“After we gets paid at five-thirty I goes to a
shop I knows and buys two-penn’orth of cooked
meat scraps. I take these to the shelter. That’s
supper. It’s not much of a sum. That’s six-
pence. Then there’s a penn’orth of pea-soup at
Ham-yard. They give you a good penn’orth there.
Sevenpence. Then there’s clothes, and a bit of
baccy runs away with some of the rest, and a bit
for a day when boards is scarce.”
“ About clothes, Fosh. How much for the outer
coat ?”
“A penny.”
“ Only a penny !” It was not half a bad gar-
ment.
“ I bought it from a mate. He had six of ’em.”
“The undercoat, Fosh ; how much ?”
“Threepence.”
“ And your shoes ?”
“Odd ones. Picked up in a barrow. Penny
the right. Twopence the left.”
“ Some of you go to the lodging-houses? ”
“That’s so. They charge fourpence there,
without bread and coffee. I don’t run to that.
Some goes to Limehouse. It’s only threepence
there
“What? They walk from the West-end to
Limehouse night and morning to save a penny ? ”
“ That’s so. To save a penny.”
“ No boards on Sundays ? ”
“ I sells matches. Buys ’em at sixpence a
dozen. Sells ’em at a shilling. Made eightpence
on Sunday.”
“ A bad winter this has been, Fosh! Why,
man, you’re crying.” . . A tear or two fell on
Fosh’s coat, and were icicles before I had turned
him inside out. No wonder Fosh found it cold
in his sixpenny suit. “ Tell you what it is, sir,”
picking off the frozen tear with his dirty finger-
nails—he was evidently ashamed of it—“ tell you
what it is, life’s like this ’ere weather. It’s a
frost.”
“ You’re in a bad way, Fosh. What are you by
trade ?”
“ Fourteen years in the army. Out in India all
the time. Invalided home. Never done no good
since.”
“ You’ve been five years trying to get work ?”
“ Five years. Fights for boards ; nights in the
open ; casual wards ; haymaking and hopping in
the summer; hawking; matches. I can’t go
glimming, I ain’t the cheek.”
“ Glimming?”
“Opening kerridge-doors, guvnor.”
Fosh is right.—“ There’s too many of us in this
’ere world. Life’s a frost.”

Fosh says there are thousands like him. —Pall

In Defence of Jamieson and Cannibalism.
Dhau Bulletin, —As much opprobrium is heaped
on the memory of the late Mr. Jamieson, of
Stanley’s expedition, I should like to say a few
words in his defence. Cannibalism, in some parts
of Africa, is not a crime—it is merely a custom
rendered respectable by antiquity, and is quite as
capable of being defended, on humane grounds, as
many of our own laws and customs. For instance,
a countrywoman of Jamieson’s, named O’Brien,
was the other day at Sydney sentenced to
six months’ imprisonment for attempting to
commit suicide. Anyone who can see the justice of
such a sentence, and calmly acquiesce in the
carrying-out of so barbarous a law, need express
no indignation at Jamieson’s conduct while
amongst the cannibals. In patronising one of
their feasts, Jamieson did not offend the laws,
customs or sensibilities of the people with whom
he was then sojourning, and was probably actu-
ated by the purest motives in acting as he did.
The girl who was eaten was a captive from
another tribe, evidently retained as an article
of diet, to be used whenever other rations
ran short, and she, being conversant with
the customs of the country, probably viewed
herself in the same light, and was possibly grate-
ful to Jamieson for hurrying up her fate and
ending the state of suspense in which she must
have lived. There is no evidence to show that
Jamieson’s presence on the scene caused the
maiden any pain or embarrassment; she may have
often picked a spare-rib herself, and only regretted
her inability to attend the feast as a guest, instead
of as the piece de resistance. Jamieson, doubtless,
imagined his sketches would be received with
acclamation in England, showing, as they did,
a simple and inexpensive method of utilising sur-
plus population.
* * *
It may be urged by some folks that instead of
encouraging the cannibals to continue their usual
customs in his presence, Jamieson should have
explained to them the beauties of Christianity
and civilisation as practised in his own country :
he might have told them how the upper classes in
civilised communities manage to live on the lower
orders without actually eating them, and how
much more real enjoyment and luxury may be got
out of a girl by working her 15 hours a day in
field or factory during the time she is capable
of such exertion, and then leaving her to
die of starvation afterwards, than by their
primitive method of eating her while’ young.
Of course this system might, at first, appear too
hard on the victims, to commend itself to the
untutored cannibal minds. But, then, Jamieson
could have explained, that use would soon deaden
their sensibilities, and render them callous to the
sufferings, groans and sighs of the procurers of their
enjoyments, and that they would then be able to
carry on frivolous, expensive amusements quite un-
disturbed, although surrounded by victims expiring
under excruciating tortures and weighty burdens.
Mr. Jamieson may therefore have kept silence,
conscientiously believing their system superior—•
on humane grounds—to that prevailing in Britain.
There is a simplicity about the way in which these
Africans go for the object they have in view, that
arouses sympathy and compels us to admit that,
at least in one respect, they show a marked
superiority oyer us. There is no damned hypocrisy
about a cannibal.—Yours, etc.,

How To Make Money.
A GREAT FUTURE INDUSTRY.
In the present day, when money-making, or the
question of how to obtain a comfortable living, is
the chief subject for .consideration witli most
people, all are on the alert to “ pick up a wrinkle ”
(to use the low vernacular) on this important
point. Many and various.are the schemes devised
for converting a shilling into half-a-crown, or, if
possible, half-a-sovereign, and with the great
majority the aim is to do so with the least amount
of risk and trouble. But experience has shown
that in the long run, perhaps, the soil, under a
proper system of treatment, affords the best
results in this direction, and, taken as a whole,
there are no more contented body of men than
the yeomen farmers. It is not our purpose, how-
ever, to descant here on the advantages of agri-
culture in the abstract, but to I'efcr to one branch
in particular of this class of industry, which, for
several reasons, has not, up to the present,
attained great dimensions in N.S.W. —viz., fruit-
culture. Curiously enough, with all the advan-
tages of our excellent climate and soil, the art of
fruit-growing has not established itself to any
extent in our midst, and by those who take an
interest in the matter diverse reasons are given as
the cause of this manifest want. Many people,
with a good deal of truth, assert that the best of
the land suited for fruit-growing is in the hands
of the large owners, while others again expatiate
upon the want of irrigation, and so on ad lib.
But it is a facI', 1 ', whether or no, that at present i
large quantities of fruit are imported which should
be produced in the colony. Beyond our orange
and vine culture, it may be said, indeed, as a
general thing, there is no systematic fruit-growing
in N.S.W. Without a doubt there are two
essentials to success in this connection, and
these are —adaptability of soil, and sufficient
moisture. To meet these requirements, and with
a view to fostering an industry which at present
languishes, a praiseworthy effort is being made by
the Land Company of Australasia that should
commend itself to all who take an interest in the
matter. The important discovery has been made
by the managing directors, of whom two—Messrs.
Edwards and Harris—may be considered experts,
that the soil on tho Ravensworth Estate, the
property of the Company, is in great
measure eminently suited for arboriculture,
and they have determined to give the
public the advantage of the fact. Inves-
tigation has proved that about 10,000 acres
of the estate, which is level country of a rich,
sandy loam, is irrigated by nature to such an
extent that without any artificial aid it contains
all desiderata for successful fruit-growing. The
laud is intersected by a network of streams, but
in addition to this water supply it also has been
found that below tho soil, which ranges in thick-
ness from Gft. to 10ft., there is an underlay of
shingly pebble and bluestonc boulders. The
effect of this formation is that the shingle bed acts
as a kind of subterraneous course for the water
which rises iu springs on the adjacent mountains,
and throughout the year there is a constant trick-
ling flow beneath the surface of fresh, pure liquid.
The result is that the soil, being of a sandy nature,
sucks up the moisture towards the roots, and even
iu the most tropical heat, w hen verdure elsewhere
is parched and limp, trees which have been
planted here are fresh and vigorous, and'they
grow with remarkable rapidity. Orchards
were planted to test the truth of tins
idea, immediately upon the fact becoming
knowui to the directors, and it is now establi- bed
beyond all question. An orchard of stone-fruit
trees which was planted seven years ago has given
ocular demonstration of tho fact, for although the
trees were planted 20 feet apart, the branches now
are touching each other, and the yields are very
large.
To enable would-be orchardists to obtain the
advantages of settlement on good soil, the directors
of the company have decided to cut up the more
suitable portions of the estate in sections and on
terms which should have the effe t of establishing
there a large and prosperous fruit-growing settle-
ment. The land will be subdivided into sections
of from 20 to 100 acres, and to assist selectois
cottages will be erected, and the preliminary steps
taken to make tho soil reproductive at the earliest
possible moment after selection. Large quantities
of cheap English money are now coming into the
coffers of the company, and it is proposed to
utilise a portion of this in the preparation of tho
estate for settlement. Already sonic orchards
have been planted and re sold, and it is at present
under the consideration of the Board to
lay out 500 acres in orchards, iu arcai to
suit large and small purchasers. One of tho
orchards which was purchased from the Company
originally, it may be mentioned, has recently been
re-sold, at a profit of several hundreds of pounds.
The advantage of the system proposed by the
Company is that selectors will find the land in
such a condition that they can almost immediately
obtain a profit, and experience lias shown that
where fruit can be grown successfully the profits
arc really very handsome, while the value of tho
property is increasing daily with the growth of
trees. Cases are plentiful m the colony where,
from six acres of orchard, no less than £5O an
acre per annum has been netted after paying all
expenses, and it is computed that < ns man alone,
can, with proper appliances, keep in good order
no less than 40 acres of land. Naturally, care is
required in the selection of the fruits to be grown,
but the experience of the directors enables them
to plant those trees which are most likely to
thrive in the different localities, and return a
good profit. It is worthy of note that the fruit
produced up to the present on the estate has been
disposed of almost entirely in the country districts,
and at prices higher than ruled at the time in
Sydney, thus proving that the metropolitan
market is not alone to be depended upon by
growers. As an additional impetus to the indus-
try, it is also proposed to erect on the estate
fruit-preserving establishments on co-operative
principles, by which means the settlers may not
only secure a market for their produce, but also
obtain a profit upon the manufacture of jams, &c.
The funds for this enterprise will be provided by
tho company, to bo afterwards repaid by the set-
tlers, who would thus obtain the whcMe thing in
their own hands. It is believed by experts that
the Ravensworth estate will ere long prove to be
the finest natural fruit-producing country in the
colony, and there is every reason to anticipate
that its future will be one of great prosperity.
The estate itself, which comprises G 5,000 acres, is
splendidly situated as regards the means of transit
either to Sydney or the various inland settlements.
It is adjacent to the main Northern line, 17 miles
beyond Singleton, and is 58 miles from New-
castle and 158 miles from Sydney. The estate,
which has a station of its own, has a railway
frontage of 16 miles, and every facility is thus
offered to intending selectors. Already over
5000 acres have been taken up, and applications
are being received for sections, which goes to
prove that the advantages offered by the company
are fully appreciated by those who are the best
able to value them.

Footprints in the Sand.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
Some human footprints have been discovered on
the sandstone formation iu a quarry near the
coast. They are about GO feet below the surface,
ami are apparently of very ancient date. —Daily
Paper. We rise to explain how these footprints
got there :
’i'was a dreary night by a dreary shore,
And slowly the murky tide did (low
With a dismal wail, and a washy roar,
Some fitty-five-huudred years ago;
And the winds flew by with a dolorous hum,
Like a worn-out harp or a muffled drum.
The skies were as dark as a hidden sin
O’er the dreamer who pondered there alone,
And sadly the inky seas rolled in.
As he sat, and cursed in an undertone;
Ho was an editor wild and thin,
And he grasped in his hand The Bulletin,
And he mused in hieroglyphics there,
For language wasn’f invented yet,
And so a citizen had to swear
In a sort of cuneiform alphabet ;
And when he couldn’t help but damn,
lie did it by means of a diagram.
For things were bad in that far-off day
About thirty-five hundred years 8.G.,
And the naked subscriber wouldn’t pay,
But always wanted his paper free ;
And a hairy contributor, long and thin,
Raised Cain when his paragraph didn’t go in.
And be thought of the undressed C.M.G.,
Who put on airs at that ancient date,
And passed resolutions beneath a tree,
A.nd grovelled, and wanted to “ federate,”
And who sat on his tail with a bilious eye
When a common democrat passed him by.
And the Primrose League that met once a week,
When the members clawed at each other’s hide,
In a slushy location beside a creek ;
And other troubles there were beside,
Including the unshod office bard
Who was tight in a barrel in the yard.
The primitive artist was on the spree
(A sort of old, aboriginal “ Hop.’ ),
He had eaten his uncle that day at three,
And put the dead relative’s boots in pop.
And a libel suit had been started too,
By an “eminent citizen ” painted blue.
And a “loyal subjecthad called that day
With a howl and a club, and said that he
Wanted the journal stopped right away,
Because of its awful disloyalty ;
And a pious man, who was feeling bad,
Had brained the printer, and withdrawn his “ad.’
And he thought of a certain man of fame,
Who—as paper wasn’t invented then,
Though finance was carried on just the same—
Had passed on him a stone P.N.,
An old red sandstone I O U,
Which was now considerably overdue.
Then, as the slow, dull tide rolled in,
With a dismal wail, and a hollow roar,
He dreamt that a spook with a mirthless grin
Was passing a plate upon the shore
And asking him to contribute
To an Himperial Hinstitoot.
And a spectral form came clad in bones,
And the tale of an ’Orrid Deed it read,
With details concerning the Hollow Groans
Of the victim, and how they smashed his head ;
(The crime, it seemed, was caused by booze
And the facts were all in the Evening News).
The voice of the birds in the sunless air
Seemed to yell forth a viewless cablegram,
Which stated that Battenberg’s “innards ” were
Inflamed, through eating unhealthy liarn.
And the world was “Pre-eminent in Grief”
Because of Bat.’s undigested beef.
Then the howl of some beast by a distant stream
Made him think, with a boding of awful woe,
That lie beard Parkes borrowing in a dream
About fifty-five hundred years ago,
Or else that unborn apost’c of light
Was kissing his Stella in the night.
Si the editor woke ’neath the murky sky,
Witli his knees supporting his weary head,
And his hat jammed down o’er his weary eye,
And asked why the world wasn’t all born dead;
And the footprints they found the other clay
Were his tracks, as he mournfully walked away.
TITUS SALT.
Some of the Queensland Mounted In-
fantry, stationed at Clermont, were sent to “ an
old hotel, very dirty, and kept by Chinese.”
They “ marched back to the stables where they
wore before victualled,” and started cooking for
themselves. They had evidently read The Bul-
letin’s articles on “Shduffing,” and declined
Chinese chew-mash. Nevertheless, The Bulletin
thinks “Shduffing” quite good enough for
creatures who hire themselves to be the guardian-
angels of blacklegs.
Dear Bulletin, — Your ‘’Half-Duck’
yarn in a recent issue recalls a somewhat similar
story. A Christmas party given by the “cove”
on a certain back-blocks station was attended by a
fine specimen of the young Australian “bushy,”
who, while all there at a muster, was quite at sea
in a ball-room. Noticing his backwardness, a
sprightly young lady from a neighbouring run
took a kindly interest in him, and even succeeded
in getting him to scramble through a quad-
rille. He fell desperately in love with her at
once, and the hostess kept up her end of the fun
so well that the cornstalk felt ho might make a
capture if ho nlaycd his cards cautiously. On
leaving for home the lady forgot her dancing-
shoes, and the hostess asked the young Lochinyar
from the plains if he would oblige by returning
them. “ Will a duck swim ?” was the reply, as the
delighted youth sprang on his horse and flew to
the home of his soul’s adored. The lady was sur-
prised to see him, but tendered a friendly
greeting, and then her enraptured admirer
blurted out; “ You forgot yer darncin’-shoes last
night, Miss, so I’ve fetched you the parcel.” His
enslaver thanked him with a smile that nearly
lifted him out of his knee-boots, but, on opening
the package, exclaimed: “ Why, there’s only one
shoe here!” “Yes,” stammered the blushing
“ bushy,” “ but I’ll bring yer th’ other one round
tomorrer; an’ look ’ere, Miss (most passionately),
“I wish to Gord yoii was a santipede, so as I
could bring you a shoe every day for the next six
months !”
His Godlike Raizon.
For all that Dan. O'Connor says,
Unth in and out of saizon,
Yo'll bet your bothom dollar, plaze,
He has “ a Godlike raizon.”
Ho loves our Royal Ladee’s name,
And won’t encourage traizon ;
He’s Oirisli, too, but all the same
Ho has a Godlike raizon.
A platform every blissed noight
His figure he displays on;
He worships girls wid all his moight—
He has a Godlike raizon.
Begorra ! wunst wp heard him shpake
About “the bed he lays on ; ”
Although he made a small mistake,
He had a Godlike raizon.
And when a filthy Dying Fowl
He didn’t fear to saize on,
It wasn’t law, but, by our sowl !
He had a Godlike raizon.
The most obtrusive characteristic of Mel-
bourne “authorities,” Civic or Governmental, is a
disposition to assume that no other city in the
world suffers from such fearful congestion of traffic,
extraordinary difficulties in general manage neut,
or so many petty matters requiring to be put
down, or put right by a bumptious bye-law. In
the malodorous retreats set apart for “ gentle-
men only,” at railway-s’tations, smoking is strictly
prohibited. The street cry of “MiUc Of” is a
punishable offence, and the ringing of a muffin-
bell is treason-felony, or something worse. The
peripatetic “sandwich-man” is against the rules,
and vehicles displaying advertisements are con-
trary to the ubiquitous regulations—except at
Municipal and Parliamentary election times, when
every cab in the land is pasted over with invita-
tions to vote for some Blowhard or Puffy who
helps to make the said regulations. Bullet-
headed policemen are specially encouraged to use
the “move on” clause for the annoyance of the
respectable portion of the community, whilst
street “ bookmakers ” and the dangerous classes
in general are left in peace to stand and spit upon
the weary wayfarer. There is no sense or system
in the bossing which Melbourne (not to mention
other Australian cities) folks meekly accept as
part of their birthright, nor is the iden-
tity of the power which suppresses a lot
of things — smoking under the piazzas of
the G.P.O., for example—quite clearly nnder-
standed of the people. Many prohibitions, ema-
nating from nowhere in particular, have been
casually painted on a board at an unknown
period and allowed to gradually establish prece-
dents. Consequently it is incumbent on the man
who walks abroad to think seriously and often of
the many things he mustn’t do in a public place,
and if his attention wander from that comprehen-
sive subject for ten minutes by the clock, he finds
himself ruthlessly grabbed for “insulting be-
haviour ” and knocked silly by a brand-new bye-
law. Perhaps the reason why Melbourne endures
all this oppression in silence is that the vanity of
its insanitary residents is tickled by the thought-
that it would be impossible to run such a densely-
populated region on the free-and-easy system
which is good enough for pettifogging places like
London, The rising generation, in particular, is
rapidly absorbing this idea, and if you drop
hints "to a high-spirited young native that the
Great Metropolis doesn’t mean the “Queen City
of the South,” he wants to fight it out to
a finish instead of inferring the matter to
arbitration. For this premature development
of patriotism the local “Radical” press is
accountable. The Herald makes a practice
of dosing its readers with instances of how’
“we are far ahead of London,” from the pens of
ardent enthusiasts who were born in Carlton, and
have seldom journeyed beyond sniffing distance
of the Yarra. Every alleged visitor of distinction
is requested to tell a Herald interviewer how
astounded he was at the enormousness of the
crowds, the turmoil of business, the unprecedented
“push” prevailing in “Our Wonderful City.”
To which the distinguished individual replies
that be was astounded, and bis condition of
mental bewilderment is promptly reported in
large capital. And now the Age has the cool
audacity, or gross ignorance, to say that “the
annoyance occasioned by pedestrians, who insist
on walking on the wrong side of the pathway, is
permitted here to an extent that would not be
tolerated in any first-class city of Europe or
America.” Does the Age mean to assert that
there are “ regulations ” for foot-passengers along
Cheapside ? There people suit their own
convenience in walking, as they do on Broad-
way, and their own convenience teaches
them to follow the stream of humanity, going
either side of the pavement. Nobody issues
orders or passes laws on the subject. If a man
attempts to push Ins way against either stream he
gets tired, or somebody else shoves him over, and
things go on proceeding’ as usual. The pedes-
trians of Marvellous Melbourne, however, are
supposed to need a special Act of Parliament to
control their lines of march. It is disgusting to
find a newspaper professing Liberalism in one
article, and advocating a further extension of
trumpery official interference in another. The
will of the people—be., of the majority—estab-
lishes a rule of the footway immediately a rule
becomes necessary, and when the Age speaks of
many towns having “regulators of the traffic,
whose sole function is to remind offending pro-
menadera ” where they ought to walk, that widely-
circulated publication is babbling in its sleep.
Nevertheless, the babble breathes the very spirit
of that peculiar stupidity (stupidity born of
vainglory in their fever-tainted collection of tall
building's and beastly back-yards) which makes the
many of Smellbourne glory in being overgoverned
by the few who are always trying to fossick out
something fresh to suppress. This qhildish belief
in the necessity for special traffic arrangements
on account of the city’s “ phenomenal increase of
population,” and so forth, seems to be growing on
the people, and will continue to grow whilst a
swarm of local mayors and several local journals
(the Argus being a decent exception) are forever
feeding it. One of these days the intelligent
foreigner will be flabbergasted by notices inform-
ing him that he mustn’t stop to talk, or think, or
‘ scratch his head in any of the principal streets
during business hours. And to these notices,
hanging from corner lamp-posts, the down trodden
Melbournian, bis face all aglow with exultation,
will point and ask—“Ain’t we going ahead at a
tremendous rate ?”
A Queensland Sanitorium.
There is many a beautiful site for a mansion
among the ranges at Toowoomba, and doubtless
the next ten years will see the landscape dotted
with fair residences, but there are few spots in
the world, search where you will, that surpass in
beauty that of the Blue Mountain Hotel, which is
fast becoming well-known over the length and
breadth of Australia, and which will ere long
claim and receive first place among health resorts.
To the visitor from the capital the climate of
Toowoomba is a pleasant revelation, but a stilb
further surprise awaits him if he wends his way
furthet into the mountains and cries excelsior,
for the Blue Mountain hostelry, though only
some four miles from Toowoomba, stands fully 500
feet higher than the City of the Range, and nearly
3000 feet above the level of the sea. Along a well-
'kept highway we spin merrily, catching here
and there a glimpse of many a pretty, quiet
scene in marked contrast to the wild natural
beauty of the hills and glens we are approaching.
Another mile or so and we reach the confines of
Mr. Holmes’ property (the Blue Mountain Estate)
and then turning sharply to the right, wh
descend a gentle declivity and find ourselves at
our destination, until now hidden under the brow
of the hill. Here the fresh free breeze of the
mountains catches us, and but little imagination
would make us fancy that wo were again in other
Highlands far away from these in which we find
burselves at Mr. "Holmes’ establishment, where
mine host on hospitable thoughts intent, awaits
to escort us through what is certainly one of
the most comfortable and best appointed hotels in
the colony. Of the size of the house one can form
no conception until a peregrination of the entire
building has been made, for it is built as it were
in sections, and thus presents that pleasant irregu-
larity dear to lovers of the homely and picturesque,
and possessing many a cosy nook, and sheltered
corner where loungers most do congregate. The
building into which our host leads us and which
contains the bar, billiard-room, dining-room,
reading-room, bacheldrs’-room —where is held
many a tobacco Parliament - and a host of rooms,
is that last erected, and a spacious establishment
does it appear as we glance down the long vista of
106 feet of corridor. .Further on is the older
part of the building which was originally Mr.
Holmes’ private residence. In all there are some
45 rooms, exclusive of public rooms, of which there
is ample accommodation. Throughout the entire
hotel, from the bar to the billiard-room, in library
and dining-room, in drawing-room and private
sitting room, the same good taste and the same
care for the comfort of the visitors is displayed,
and it would be difficult to find more luxuriously-
appointed rooms anywhere. It is evident that
the proprietor has spared neither trouble nor
expense in a praiseworthy .effort to please his
patrons, and we are sure that everyone who has
resided at the Blue Mountain Hotel will agree
with us in saying that he has succeeded. The
proprietor of the Blue Mountain Hotel has
objects in view which cannot possibly bring him
into collision with any other business man. He
caters for holidays-seekers, he finds his clients
among those who, leaving one town, do not seek
to find change of air in another, preferring the
seclusion and beauty of the Range resort. We
think these considerations should free the. pro-
prietor from all rivalry and insure him the good
offices of all All the time we have been spinning
this long dissertation our host has been standing
ready to usher us into a beautifully-appointed
parlour where everything is in the best of taste.
This, it seems, is the sacred oratory of Hymen.
Here honeymooners come to spend the interlude
in the play of life, the epoch in man’s history at
which bachelors scoff, ancient Benedicts sigh, and
of which the honeymooners themselves pretend
more or less successfully to be profoundly ignorant.
We suppose that the honeymoon is a time-honored
custo*i that cannot bo gainsaid or set aside, and
this being so—if young folks will marry—by all
means let them betake themselves under Mr.
Holmes’ hospitable roof. And now we seek the
front verandah facing the vast expanse of the
ranges. There down below in the hollow twists
the railway, like two gigantic twin snakes until it
creeps round a corner to re-appear again half a mile
further on, ultimately disappearing into a tunnel.
Down below in front and as far as the eye can
stretch lies the expanse of the Main Range, a
huge verdant plain ploughed up by nature, and
in which the furrows arc waving tree-tops. Here
and there a cloud obscures the dark-blue of the
sky, and instantly is it photographed on the
waving green-tinted and cverchanging foliage
beneath. Suddenly a cloud sweeps into view
and we see the tree-tops darken as though a giant
brush had changed their tints ; again the cloud
sweeps on and the shadow vanishes only to play
the truant artist in another place. Ear in the
distance is a great peak called Spicer's, and near it
a huge cleft which our host tells us is Cunning-
ham’s Gap, full of sad memories for those who
seek the via recta ; and the wonderful clearness of
the atmosphere is demonstrated by the ease with
which the large opposing range is scanned, for we
are told that the Gap is fully sixty miles distant.
No wonder those who have been here once come
back, for greater pleasure for those in whom
the artistic and poetic faculties are present could
not be imagined than to watch Nature in her most
beautiful aspect as seen from the corner of the
Range, and whether the visitor be on pleasure or
health intent he cannot resist the charm of the
climate, which has a strangely exhilarating effect.

. citizen:—
Statutory Declaration.
“I, George llewett, do hereby solemly and
sincerely declare as follows :
“That I feel it a duty I owe to the publi: to
state that I have been suffering for many years
from weakness of the stomach, so called INDI-
GESTION or DYSPEPSIA, and have been cured
by my taking two or three glasses of ROW’S

I hope others suffering from tire same complaint

Row’s Bteane’s Wine
Is a safe and sure stimulant for the female sex or
children, for it raises and strengthens depressed
systems without producing a temporary excite-
ment to be followed by greater depression.
Persons suffering from loss of appetite and
general depression of spirits cannot do better than
take
ROWS STEANE’S WINE.
It cannot harm you, but must do good to all
delicate persons. Young Ladies can take this
when suffering from general debility. It’s only a
pure tonic. Try it.
Teetotallers will find this newly-invented
TONIC answer all the purposes of a stimulant
without its intoxicating quality. It will satisfy
the cravings of nature, and create a desire for food
instead of drink. As an anti-febrile, is unsur-
passed.
ROW’S

the liver and kidneys, in more reliable for remov-
ing all impure secretions than any other medicinal

CHARLES CURTIS, M.R.C.S., England.
Port Adelade, October 30, 1880.
Read an expression of thankfulness received
from the undersigned :
“I have for many years been obliged to take
medicines of different kinds for affections of the
liver, indigestion, pain in the chest, general de-
bility, feeling of nervousness, weariness, great
depi’ession of spirits, and so on, but all without
producing any beneficial effect, till at last, being
recommended to try ROW’S DANDELION
BITTERS, which, happily, I find has produced
an unexpoc+jd and wonderful effect and change
in my syslTfu, and has removed from my mind
the horrible depressed feeling and former con-
dition of bodily ailment I have so unhappily ex-
perienced fbr so many years.
“ I am glad of the Opportunity to make known
the excellent qualities of ROW’S DANDELION
BITTERS, that those who are afflcted as I have
been may take advantage of them.

A Lay of the Lash.
(FROM HAMILTON GAOL.)
We sing of Oorney Bourke, who was an insult to
the Law,
And a very vulgar moral from his story we will
draw ;
We cannot say for certain when his wickedness
began,
But it’s evident that Corney is a dreadful sort of
man.
With a taste for ardent spirits, as a young ’un he
was curs’d,
And he liked to beat his mother, very possibly, at
first;
He wouldn’t learn his lessons when a chubby,
growing lad
(We are taking it for granted ho was always pretty
bad).
He may have been an angel in his early salad
days,
Who talked of love and honour, like the gentlemen
in plays ;
Perhaps a fickle sweetheart set our Corney going
wrong—
Though it pleases us to fancy he was awful all
along.
But, anyway, no matter ; he took long ago to
crime,
When he wasn’t doing mischief he was mostly
“ doing time
That didn’t make him better, which is altogether
odd,
For there’s nothing so improving as a year or two
in “ cjuod.”
He became an “old offender,” and the name of
Corney Bourke
Was very much against him if he wanted honest
work ;
The “ peelers ” had to watch him when he chanced
to be at large,
And they never left off watching till they had him
back in charge.
There’s a law of evolution which must govern such
a case,
And a rising scale of charges for the prison human
race,
Thus the infamy of Corney evoluted more and
more,
And his newest crime was “ wusser ” than the one
he did before.
So it naturally happened that a learned judge
(salute !),
Who would scorn to give a flogging to a mean
four-1 eggei brute.
Endeavoured to put Corney on a higher moral
tack,
Through the grace of twenty lashes on his cold,
uncovered back.
A warder basted Corney till he hadn’t strength to
x move,
Then they put him, bleeding, cursing, on a pallet,
to improve ;
And the legal lesson taught him had the usual
effect
Of increasing Oorney’s virtue, and his proper self-
respect. _
But when his term was ended and from prison he
was sent,
The beast had quite forgotten that he wanted to
repent,
And the hymn, unohastened Corney used at even-
tide to sing
Was —“Now Iye been spread-eagled, I suppose I
oughter swing.”
His nature grew susceptible to changes in the
wind,
Which gave him nasty twinges where his body had
been skinned,
And ho felt a horrid impulse to go forth upon tin
basli,
Each time he was reminded of the “swishing ” of
the lash.
It came to pass in prison, in a good old dungeon-
cell,
That Corney had a comrade, and he thought he’d
give him ’ell;
The other chap was ailing, and could barely get
his breath—
So, what did Corney do—but kick and batter him
to death.
That other chap was old, and wicked Corney’s
aged, too,
And wo guess he simply killed him ’cause he’d
nothing else to do.
Some heroes slaughter people and get crosses,
medals, stars—
Old Corney. he’s got nothing but dishonourable
scars.
“ No motive for the murder,” says his Honour on
the Bench ;
It wasn’t done for money, nor for love of any
wench,
But we can find a motive for this bloody deed and
black,
In those “marks of flagellation ” on the wretched
fellow’s back.
A few years ago, at the ceremonious open-
ing of Kyneton (Vic.) District Court, the present
writer was much shocked by the action of a cer-
tain iconoclastic blacksmith. Up in the gallery,
where all onlookers, reporters, &c.,
was a rough-looking personage in his every-day
attire, two special features of which consisted in
his retaining his leather apron and wearing his
battered hat on his head regardless of our
warning looks. lie stood erect noting the
numerous official mummeries with supercilious
scorn. Very soon the judge entered the court-
house, and forthwith the crier commenced his
asinine preamble, which, as usual, ended with
“ Oyez oyez, God Save the Queen !” Then, in a
loud, vigorous voice, this iireverend stranger
belched forth “ . the Queen!” and
immediately sat down. For nearly a full minute
there was a dreadful silence, and all the occupants
of the aforesaid gallery shook from head to toe,
and fixed their eyes on the judge. The fact that
truth is often as strange as fiction was in this
instance strikingly exemplified. Pretending not
to have heard anything the judge called on the
first case, and so the incident passed officially
unnoticed.

How to Grow Rich.—Invest in land at Perth,
W.A. Plans from Intercolonial Investment Co.,
Limited, 1)0 Bathurst-street, Sydney.
The well-informed London editor has
struck a new horror. He has ascertained that
Australian lunatics are disposed of by shipping
them secretly and silently to Samoa, where they
arc turned loose upon the mountains to live upon
grass and Providence. Presumably, they are
landed at night, and, though no details are sup-
plied, imagination can fill in the horrid picture.
A long, low schooner, painted black, heaves-to in
the darkness, and drops the cook into four fathoms
of water. The sun is setting violently in the east,
and behind the vessel are the dull, dark leaden
wastes of the Pacific, while in front is a low,
desolate shore, diversified only by a mountain
02,000 feet high. On the sides of it are bears,
camels, and pannikins, and on the summit the
infuriated jam-tin lies low in its lair, while the
yells of the Wclsh-rabbit arc heard in the dis-
tance. Behind the mountain there is a burning
desert eighty miles wide, full of ostriches and
boa-constrictors. Tha unprincipled boss-pirate
then commands, in a hoarse, agitated voice,
that the hatches be taken off and the maniacs
sorted out on deck, and the purser brings up the
bill of lading for 800 tons of incurable naked mad-
men. He also reports that starboard idiot No.
1721 is slightly damaged by water, and that a
quantity of bulk lunatics in the lower deck have
shifted in the recent gale and been considerably
deteriorated, while two hypochondriacs have been
short-shipped. Next the derrick is rigged, or else
the monkey-wrench, and the imbeciles, and the
land-boomers who have gone off their respective
chumps, and the homicidal patients are swung
ashore by their hair, all except one who drops
overboard in the confusion. When the last of
them is landed the schooner sets sail once more,
while her cargo starts away inland and scares
the inhabitants into fits. This is the story
as it ought to have appeared, if the London
editor had possessed any vestige of descrip-
tive power, but, alas, it lacks the great element
of hard-boiled accuracy. If the horrid truth
must be told, no one knows exactly what
becomes of the Australian lunatics, and
no one asks. They are shipped to Queensland,
and landed up one of the rivers, at a little wharf
beside a large factory. They go in at one door of
the building, and yet the natives of the place say
that they never come out at the other. The men
who work in the establishment are all largo and
fierce-looking, with projecting teeth and immense
under-jaws ; and dull thuds are heard in the place
accompanied by shrieks. If anyone asks the cause
of this row they laugh a sepulchral laugh and say
that they were splitting firewood. The river is
full of .squashed hats stained with blood, which
drift wearily up and down with the tide, and there
is a deposit of gory hats for miles along either
shore. All the employes in that factory have
several hundred misfit shirts, collars, suits of
do'lies, and boots apiece, and they always
decline to state where they got them, but
anybody who has missed a deranged relative
can go up there and he will invariably find
somebody wearing a collar or a shirt with the
lost friend’s name upon it. About once a week a
vessel comes alongside the wharf, and is loaded
up with boxes labelled “ox-tongue.” Where it
goes nobody knows, but travellers Voyaging across
the Pacific often come across a lot of floating
cargo, which makes them think that a line-of-
battle ship, filled with ox-tongue, has sunk there-
abouts. This is all that is really known about
Australian lunatics. They go, and they never
come back, and nothing remains but the squashed
hats and the ox-tongue to build a tale upon. If
the London editor already alluded to will kindly
accept this explanation, we will feel grateful. It
is always a genuine pleasure to enlighten a London
editor.

SWORN CERTI Fit ATE. —One of Thousands more
Noble-street, Newton, Geelong,
10th December, 1388.
To H. F. Kugelmanm, Esq.
Dear Sir,—This is to certify that I, Patrick Keenan, was
taken ill about three years ago with a severe cold, jvhich
turned into Bronchitis and became chronic. I consulted
more than one doctor, and during that' time took a great
quantag of -medicine without it doing me the slightest
good, but 1 became worse every day, wasting atraifuntil
I became a perfect skeleton. About February last i began
to spit up blood, and what with the cough and severe
pains in-my left lung, and the quantity of bad matter 1
was expectorating every day, I became very much alarmed.
Hearing of your professional skill 1 consulted you, and
you told me you could cure me for a given sum. I agreed
and went under your treatment in March last. At the
■end of three months I was taken bad one morning, and
vomited about two pints of blood, matter and stringy
phlegm. From that time I commenced to improve, anil
was gaining in weight every day. About a month ago the
blood ceased coming, the cough disappeared, and the
lung healed completely, and thank God and your pro-
fessional skill, I am as well as ever.
P. KEENAN.
Declared and subscribed before me, one of Her Majesty's
Justices of the Peace, for the Southern 'Bailiwick, 'in the
County of Grant, this 10th day of December, 1888.
