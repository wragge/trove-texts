interesting to Brandy and Whisky Drinkers.
rpHE imports of case Whisky during the year 1897 amounted to 115,357 cases,
those of case Brandy to 43,723 cases. These figures exhibit a marked increase
in the consumption of Brandy, and show a strong tendency of the public to revert
to that spirit as their favorite drink. It was thought by many that the consumption
of Whisky was fully eight cases to every one of Brandy, whereas the proportion is
only about 2| to 1. ... The wholesomeness of

“The New Australian School Series” issued
by Win. Brooks and Co., Sydney, of which four
numbers are published and three are to come.

lished—improves decidedly upon the old. The
old Was often dull and stupid—the new is not;
the old was ill-graduated—-the new is much better
graduated, and, in an equal number of pages, the
pupils are taken farther along the road of learn-
ing. The old took far too ponderous pains to be
informing : the new takes pains to be readable.
In fact, to the making of the new series, as com-
pared with the old, have come bet ter brains and
more of them. The illustrations, too, are greatly
improved and are more numerous. Two typical il-
lustrations are given on this page—one from Primer
11. of fche-ol I series, by an unknown hand -Eng-
lish, of course ; and the other from Primer 11. of
the new series. t>y A ustnli >'n Ma'hon'y. Msiiony’s
bullock-driver may be a little
Noah’s.arkish, but he ise\i-
dently a modern chap, w i h
the latest linguistic improve-
ments : the antique seen flog-
ging his half-dozen trim
oxen in the other cut is a
ridiculous myth like his
road, and his waggon, and
his whip, and everything
that is his. And Mahony’s
bullocks are real blankies—
though a blunder in the text
calls them “oxen.” The
illustrative work throughout
the new series—three other
exam pies are given—is nearly
all e'ever and interesting.
Souter’s careful, clean,
minute style points tales
and morals admirably as a rule, and he
gets fine character into his drawings see
the example reproduced ; but some of his
decorative grotescjueries are unsuited to childish
minds, which should be fed for the most
part with true and sitnp’o pictures—the one-
syllables of art. The tir.-d slab with the
twisted hand and the scowl and the axe over his
shoulder is supposed to represent “A Bush Boy ”

tion is charming.
* m * *
The editor of the new series, R. F. Irvine,
takes credit for struggle and success in interest-
ing: there is nothing so important as the interest.
In school after school you will met blockhead
teacher after teacher making the business of edu-
cation a children’s penance instead of pleasure—
dumping solid facts down on the poor little heads,
and oft-n, it is to be feared, doing irreparable
harm by associating books with mulling but pain-
ful memories and more painful prospects. To
anyone who can free sis mind from the influence
of routine and dogma, it is a perennial wonder to
see with what vitality and buoyancy children sur-
mount the obstacles thrown in their mental path.
The .writer has had under observation for some time
three children attending a N.S. W. public school.
Ihe eldwit, a boy aged 13, has been cramming for
Sydney University Junior Exam. He is a tall,
pale youth with a wobble in his gait, and he has
been attending school from 8.30 a.m. to 1 p.m. ;
from 2 p.m. to 5.3 c p.m., and from 7-30 p.m. to
10 and 10.30 and even 11
p. m. This for five days a
week for months together—
with occasional evening
holidays compensated by
Saturday morning school.
The second child, a bright
little girl of 11, is, on six
days a week, kept up until
9 or 10 o’el >ck by “home
lessons ” drawing maps,
parsing sentences, commit-
ting to memory long lists of
historical dates and geo-
graphical names sheer
waste of time for the most
part. The third is a bov of
8 or 9—the mill has just
clutched him, and he. too,
has “home lessons ” which
keep him up long after tea-
time-poor little wretch !
Any doctor, anybody who
knows what exhausting de-
mands brain-work makes
L on growing boys and
gills, will say at once that
“ home lessons ” ought not
to be permitted before 12
years of age, if then—taking
an average of children. To keep young children
confined in school for five hours a day and then to
f ag their nervous system in theevening is justih aider
of the young generation. The writer is convinced
that many of the sallow lads and weedy girls so
often seen in Australian cities owe the beginning
of their physical ruin to our gorgeous system of
“ national education ” (so-called). The parents of
the children quoted are good, simple folk who
stimulate their unfortunate offspring to further
labour. To “pass the Junior” is the apex of
effort. The boy with the wobble in his gait
succeeded in passing : his name was in the last-
issued list : and it is the writer’s honest opinion
that he and Australia would probably be better off if
A Bullock-Team (New Australian School Series).
he had never opened a book. For starting now, with
a strong body, a fresh brain, and intelligent tuition,
he could learn in a couple of yeirs all he knows
that is worth knowing; and have sound health to
bo >t. Now, on the strength of his Junior “pass,”
he is waiting at home to go up for the civil
service examination. His destiny is a cheap
billet in the Lands—beautiful destiny ! —but he
won’t get any marks for “mental vigor” under
the. CS. Board’s new regulations. The colt has
been backed too early.
* * * *
Are the masters and mistresses to blame? It
would be a hard thing to say so. They are bound
to the wheel of the system, and the inspector’s
rid breaks their bones if they wriggle m going
round. And, lest the inspector should chastise
them with whips, they chastise their pupils
with scorpions—grinding the young flesh and
blood into lists of English kings and the uredicate
of the verb “to suffer.” Yet you can hear laugh-
ter in a playground, and see rosy faces in the
school ! Youth is wonderful !
* * • *
Is this a tirade against education? By no
means: the lout and the dullard are almost as
objectionable as the precocious imp who reads the
Herald. But education is
a pleasure ; there is no need
in the world to make a toil
of it. Learning history is
the most entrancing game
in the world. Learning
geography is the next most
entrancing. But there is
small need of books, and
none of “home lessons,”
to play these games. All
that you want is a teacher
with the right kind of brains,
and some maps, and maybe
a few big pins with sealing-
waxed heads such as Hardy
used in “Tom Brown at
Oxford.” And wh>*re will
you get your teacher with
brains ? and how will you
regulate individual eccentri-
city ? and how will you
measure his labor ?
Alas ! that teacher,
that regulation, that
measurement, are on
the large scale unat-
tainable. A hundred
genius - teachers at
<£l4o a year—or even
at £360 !—you might
as well look for
diamonds in the
Botany sand - Lll.o.
And you need, not a
hundred, but a thou-
sand-looking to the
future, many thou-
sands. So the most
enthusiastic reform-
ers presently drift
back to the rut—the
“Do this in that way,
and nothing else but
this ! ” and we take
the machine - made
results and are sor-
rowful. But it is
A Rush Roy.
at least possible to remodel the rut-to soften
the edges a little, and break a clod’s
head here and there. Certainly, for example,
there is no n -ed or defence for “ home
lessons ” 1 1 ‘tore 12 years of age, and very little for
a good while after. And the whole abominable
structure of grammar-teaching should be swept
away, with its outhouses of analysis, and parsing,
and so on. The thing to teach is not grammar,
but literature—not the dry bones of the language,
but its flesh and blood and brain. A child
trained by good models insensibly imitates sis
models, i’he boy who always heat's “ YVe are”
Cannot possibly say “We is.’ His memory regis-
ters the correct form, and it is unnecessary to
burden it with the formula that a plural noun
demands a plural verb. Rules and formulas have
their place, but it is not the place they are given
now—almost at the beginning of school-life. And
a very small modicum of their present enormous
bulk is sufficient at any time.
* « * •
Always the first thing to do to fix an impression
is to interest the ohild. All school-manuals put
this stale truth in the forefront of their battle j
yet the bulk of school-lessons are the most unin-
teresting tilings imaginable, Brooks’s series of
reading-books has been commended for interest;
it is commended again. Not every item is a story,
as it should be ; but the plain statements are well-
decorated—which is not a hull, however it looks
like one. Some cursory criticism : —Primer 1., 26
(a book for babes) talks of “pure wine in a cup
and beer in a mug.” Wine is never at its best in
a cup—the infants should be taught to drink it in
a glass, and feast the eye before the palate. And
if the infant isn t “ up to ” a glass, the statement
should be postponed till Primer 11. Some people
might plead for tea in the cup, to balance things
teetotally with the beer in the mug : this is a
nice point. Primer 11., 19. talks of “dad”—
an ugly, unnecessary word. If a child can read
“nowhere” supra , it can read the fine old mellow
father.” At p. 34 the child is instructed
“When you get up at break of day, thank God
for the bright sun.” Presumably this is a conces-
sion to the current creed, like the Hebrew myths
included later; but it is the kind of seed from
which tlie prayer-for-rain crop grows. However,
the loophole for escape wili let a bullock-waggon
through, for no Australian child gets up
at break of day unless se is going to catch
something, and the eight-o’clock-rising child
can take the sun as read. First Reader, 75,
has an unscientific statement about bees—“ The
drones are big, lazy fellows, who never do any-
thing but eat.” As, without drones, a hive of
bees would die out in one generation, this seems
unreasonable. Sydmy Smith (is it?) argues
somewhere that the agricultural laborer who takes
all the bacon and leaves only cabbage and bread
for his wife and children need not be as greedy as
he looks. For wife and children depend upon his
labor, and if he weakened his strength by
sharing the bacon they might go without even
cai bige and bread. Similarly, the drone eats
to a very definite and important end ; and
if the New Australian School Series can do with-
out him, that is more than the bees can. First
Reader, 8, has a questionable maxim : “ Doing
nothing is doing ill ; ” for he who does nothing
may be collecting strength to do far better. It a
snalce. didn’t sleep in the winter it couldn’t bite so
hard in the spring. At p. 28 is a similar piece of
antiquated morality—“A kind heart is better
than a fair face.” Is a cow better than a Chinese
orchestra? What is the use of comparing things

unrelated ? A kind heart is not necessarily better
tlian a fair face : from a kind heart come kind ac-
tions ; but one fair face -may beget millions of kind
acts. What is the value in kind acts of the sacred Ma-
donna-stimulus shining I nun a fair face of R ipliael?
Second Reader, p. 8, badly misquotes Kingsley’s
‘‘Be good, sweet maid” verse, as" given in Mao*
Indian's 'B9 edition. At p. 27, it is stated—with-
out evidence, and no doubt wrongly —that “ the
first wasp made just as good p iper as any wasp
can make now.” Chances are that the first wasp
no more mad ■ good paper than the first builder
made a good bouse—•“goodness’’ everywhere
evolves painfully. There other holes for
minute criticism ; but t os is enough.
The chief defect of the New Australian School
Series, as compared with the old, is the inferior
printing. Children’s -yesarea precious possession;
and children should get good big black print
on good white paper. The new Primer I. is much
less legible than the old : the type is unsuitable,
with thin hair-lines, and the ink is never solidly
black. Further, too much matter has been
crowded in : it would have been better to leave
out two lines on every page, and put wider space
b< tween the lines. The new Primer 11. is not so
well printed and not so legible as the old. No
First Reader is at hand for comparison ; but in
the new Second Reader, though the type is larger
tlian in the old, it is printed grey, instead of solid
black. The type throughout the whole of the new
series strains the eyes : it is too fine, not suf-
ficiently spaced, and never printed with a good
black color. N.S. W. E lunation Dept, should
have this fault mended at once.

[FOR THE BULLETIN. ]
The Wood of Existence.
The wind is low and the forest dark,
The dead leaves wheel in a riot,
The roots upcurl and the trees stand stark
In the midst of a grave disquiet.
The red, dead leaves they are crisp and curled.
And a cloud droops low in the distance ;
A cloud ? —ah, no, but the Woe of the World
That cumbers the Wood of Existence.
Shadows and shudders and groping hands,
And tears like a dull rain falling,
Loud footfalls suddenly quenched in sands,
And a death-stilled, desolate calling.
And here and there a shadowy throng
With taloned hands that waited
For one who fared with a lifted song
And a high-thrown head elated.
And what were these that dulled the gloom
Of that weird wood and clouded ;
O, they were Memories from the tomb
And Sins dark-eyed and shrouded.
And here way-wounded feet and lame,
And there a torn heart bleeding,
In the distance a hand that carved a name,
While the many went by unheeding.
Afar a faith like a fire that ends,
And hopes that fall or falter,
A prayer half-said and a knee that bends
At the foot of a lampless altar.
Said two that speeded : “ Afar it glows,
A glade in the darkness gleaming,
And there amid green, behold the Rose
Of Love a-droop and a-dreaming !
“ ’Twas here,” they say ; “ ’twas there,” they cry ;
“ It flies like a dream before us ;
We may reach yon love-land ere we die ”
But the winds laughed low in a chorus.
“ Link hands,” they urge, “link hands and haste,
Though the winds o’ the world ring hollow,
We have little enough of life to waste,
Let us follow and follow and follow.”
And one joyed loud o’er the under-woe
(Eyes wild and long locks hoary);
He had climbed through the Woe of the World,
and so
He saw the stars in their glory.
The many joyed not; with eyes and ears
Long weary of wind and weather,
And feet that dragged with the weight of years,
They wandered the wood together.
But, lo ! where the cloud like a curtain furled
Is folded close in the distance,
’Tis said, they pass from the Woe of the World
That cumbers the Wood of Existence.
N.S.W.
RODERIC QUINN.
Mortmain.
Grim forbear in the vanished Past,
Through shade and shine
A king art thou to mould my days,
By Right Divine, —
Within my heart-strings lapt it lies
That hand of thine !
I flouted oft the motley garb
That once he wore ;
(That sorrowful laugh of mine, belike,
Was his before ;)
I boast me free—so boasted he
In days of yore.
In varying mood he filled my cup,
He drugged my bowl;
With potent hand he penned all o’er
My human scroll ;
His Mud and Marble blended built
My House of Soul.
And in this flux and flight of years
One thing I deem —
That “Past can bury Past ” is nought
But dotard-dream ;
The Dead are ever real here,
The Living seem !
Grim forbear in the vanished Past,
Our souls entwine ;
Thy gracious deeds again I do—
Thy guilt is mine ;
Nor Heav’n nor Hell shall free me from
That hand of thine !
Q.
P. LUFTIG.
The White Night.
The moon above the dreaming sea
Swoons in her unknown maiden height,
The wind-filled trees are calling me
To come outside into the night.
The pauses in their shaken cry
Are wide, and wonderful with peace.
The stretch of marvellous white sky
Is sweet Night’s own, with never fleece
Of floating cloud to veil the stars
That dare to bring their rivalry—
Strong Sirius and flaming Mars,
And high Canopus, known to thee
Most sweet Nile-snake, whose charm is still
Alive for us, thy lovers late !
On every gully, every hill
The dreamlight falls, and on these straight
Is spread a dim, pale mystery,
Cleft by the sudden pain that there
The curlew’s wail flings forth to be
A torture to the tranquil air.
Is thy white soul, beloved, nigh
To linger in this night divine,
And sing low in the wandering sigh
Of trees and wind to this of mine ?
S.A.

SATURDAY, AUGUST 6, 1898.
The New Aspect of New South Wales
Politics.
Something large and heavy and jagged
struck the Ministry of No-Yes Reid last
week, and at time of writing it was diffi-
cult to say how much of it was left after
the shock. Eight Ministers went to the
country, and only five came back. The
three lost were Sydney Smith, who went
down at Bathurst: the awful Jacob Gar-
rard, Minister for Ignorance ; and the
dense and callous Gould, who met the ghost
of Suffield at Singleton and was deservedly
wiped out by nearly 200 votes. There might,
or, again, there might not, have been a fourth
lost Minister if Attorney-General Want had
kept his promise, as Barton and the two
O’Connors did, to come down from the
safe refuge of the House of Nominees and
face the electors; but that anti-Billious
gentleman quitted the fight before it fairly
started, and fled back to his secure niche
in the Fossil Chamber, where the voter
troubleth not and the public is shut out.
Against the downfall of three Ministers
is to be set the fact that of the four
Federal leaders only one—B. R. Wise—
is among the politically saved. Barton,
Bruce Smith, and R. E. O’Connor all
took a contract that was too large.for them ;
s'ill none of these four was previously in the
Assembly, so at the worst the leaders of
federalism gained one seat, while the
leaders of Provincialism lost three. And
the cold wind of calamity blew on the
Ministerial rank and file, which went
down heavily. There are 125 members in
New South Wales Assembly, and out of the
list of Government nominees issued over
Premier Reid’s own signature the day before
the battle only 64 are elected. Of these,
moreover, a good many are Labor members,
so the direct Ministerial following has got
down very low. On a rough estimate,
the Reid party numbers about 48; the
assured Opposition about 50; the Labor-
party 19; and there are eight independent
skirmishers. Therefore, the man who holds
the reins of power in the next New South
Wales Parliament will have to pay for the
support of the Labor-party with concessions,
and the Labor-party is so absolutely boss of
the situation that it will probably want con-
cessions of an extensive kind.
» * * *
The situation is almost the exact duplicate
of that which existed after the general elec-
tion of 1891. Then, also, there was a
Federation Bill on the board, and parties
were so equally divided that the Labor mem-
bers held the balance. In ’9l they wanted
concessions in return for support, just as
they do now. And in ’9l Parkes was
pledged to promote Federation, just as
Reid is now; and Want was against the
Bill, just as Want is now, only in those
days the leader of the Cabbage-Tree Mob
sat in the Assembly instead of in the Council.
Also, in 1891, just as in 1898, the Labor-
party was a great deal more anxious about
local reforms than about Federation, and
the Parkes Ministry didn’t want to
federate nearly so much as to keep its billet,
which is just what is the matter with the
ruins of the Reid Ministry to-day. Also, in
each case the Labor-party was strong enough
to ask a great deal in return for its support,
and Parkes dropped the Federal issue in
order to do something to placate the men
who held the balance, and while struggling
to do it he fell over something and broke
his political neck. There the parallel pro-
bably ends, for Reid has more wiles and
even less scruples than Parkes ever had,
and he is more likely to wriggle over some-
thing than to fall.
* • * *
Unless somebody finds a seat in the
Assembly for Barton or R. E. O’Connor or
Bruce Smith or two or all three of them,
Reid’s best chance lies in the want of
leaders on the Opposition side. The fact
that B. R. Wise is the only one of the four
Federal chiefs who has found a place in the
Assembly, threatens to leave a great deal too
much of the leadership in the hands of W.
J. Lyne. And Lyne lacks the capacity for
leadership ; he is short of tact and eloquence
and charm ; he has almost as few genuine
democratic instincts as Reid, and he has not
Reid’s valuable capacity for political dis-
honesty and for pretending to have what he
has not, and the blushless mendacity of the
Scotch wriggler is not in him. Above all,
there are grievous fears that he lacks the
capacity to bury the fiscal issue when it most
wants to be buried, and to sit hard down on
its ghost when the said ghost wants to be sat
upon. And he is nearly as provincial in
his Federal ideas as Reid himself. The
Barton party has come back in great
strength—only it has come back without
Barton. And if Barton or a reasonably good
substitute for him doesn’t appear, it seems
as if the issue would lie, to a great extent,
between Reid —who either doesn’t want to
federate at all, or who only wishes to do it
on practically impossible terms, and Lyne,
whose Federal ideas are somewhat limited
and woefully parochial ; with the Labor-
party, which is very cold in the cause of
United Australia, holding the balance be-
tween them. And the other element in the
case is the Legislative Council, which is
largely anti-Federal, and largely bossed by
Attorney-General Want, the bitter Provin-
cialist, whose avowed idea of Federation is
that New South Wales should dominate the
whole show, the revenues and the Parlia-
ments of the other provinces included. And
it is freely reported that Reid is going to
crowd up the Council with a dozen defeated
and discredited Provincialists of his own
party, by way of strengthening Want’s posi-
tion in the House of Parochialism.
• * * *
Still, all these are mere speculations ; the
kaleidoscope of New South Wales politics
has whirled round so rapidly of late that it
is impossible to say what may happen.
Premier Reid may decide that it is better
and cheaper to buy, with concessions, the
Federal vote in the Assembly than the Labor
vote, and may really start a Federal
movement, or he may pretend so well as to
make people think he is really doing it. Or
Lyne may have the intelligence to sit down
hard on the fiscal spectre, which has no
business to be on in this act, and to keep up
the Federal banner, if he hasn’t mislaid it.
Moreover, it is eminently probable that seats
will at once be found in the Assembly for
the three missing Federal leaders. And the
strength of the Barton party lies in the fact
that it polled about 3000 more votes than
the Reid and Labor parties combined (these
are the Daily Telegraph’s ownanti-Billious
figures published in last Friday’s issue), only
in a province where the electorates vary
from 1300 to 3000 voters the party with a
majority of votes may be in a bad minority
as regards members. So far as majority rule
is concerned, Barton has won every battle
on the Federal issue. He scored 10,000 or
12,000 more votes than Reid at the election
of Federal delegates. His party (the Bill
party) had over 5000 majority on Referendum
day. And at the general election the Barton
party scored 25,000 more votes than the
Reid party, and 3000 more than the Reid
party and the Labor crowd put together.
At all events, Premier Reid, with his
lost majority, can’t dictate to the other
provinces, on his own account, in the loud,
aggressive voice which he and Jack Want
proposed to use. And Reid, the man
who pledged himself to retain the nominee
Council, and abandoned all his promises of
sweeping away the Fossil Chamber, is now
dependent for his billet on the Labor-party,
whose “fighting platform” at the election
where Reid’s three colleagues went under,
included the utter abolition of that body.
Therefore, if that fighting platform really
means anything, and the Labor-party is not
to be bought with a casual portfolio and a
seat or two on the Public Works Committee,
there is a very awkward problem in view.
For John Henry Want, M.L.C., is hardly
the kind of man to be easily abolished, and
the Legislative Council, after Premier Reid’s
assurances, is hardly likely to take its ex-
tinction in a kindly spirit. In one way and
another, and provided that a highly int.erest-
ing situation is not wrecked by the untimely
appearance of the fiscal ghost or by hopeless
mismanagement, there is the raw material
for a soul-stirring row in the new aspect of
New South Wales politics.
Gould on Suffleld.
Minister of Justice Gould, just before
lie was deservedly wiped out by the electors
of Singleton, took occasion to hold forth on the
Suffield case and the comments of The Bul-
letin thereon. His remarks, a full report of
which appear in Singleton Argus of 26th July,
were a masterpiece of evasion and shuffling,
and a wonderful example of how a small attor-
ney in a corner can avoid committing himself.
He did not make one single allusion to the evi-
dence which irresistibly points towards a gross
miscarriage of justice in Suffield’s case—to
the fact that the girl herself said she had been
attacked by a bull, and stuck to the statement
for a long time—to the fact that the witnesses
who came on to the spot within a minute or
two of the alleged outrage found a bull there
and no trace of a man—to the fact that two
witnesses swore that Suffield was at his own
lodgings at the time of the alleged assault—to
the fact that there was no scratch or injury on
Suffield, and no stain on his clean clothes, to
show that he had had a desperate struggle with
a strong and desperately-resisting girl—or to
the face that at least one doctor refused to
certify that she had been assaulted by a man
at all, and that no independent witness claimed
to have seen Suffield anywhere near. All
these things and all the other evidence were
carefully ignored in Minister Gould’s lame and
foolish defence.
* * * *
But he said that ex-Ministers O’Connor and
Slattery were satisfied, which may or may
not be true, and which matters nothing at all
in any case. For when O’Connor and Slat-
tery are satisfied that Protection is the only
wise fiscal policy, Gould, the Foreign-trader,
simply says that their judgment isn’t worth
anything, so his professed belief in the infalli-
bility of O’Connor and Slattery when it suits
him is a very ridiculous sham. He said that
Dr. Manning was also quite satisfied, and even
if this were true (which it isn’t) it isn’t evi-
dence ; if it is any satisfaction to Gould, The
Bulletin will find him 1000 persons who are
quite satisfied not only with the Suffield ver-
dict, but also with every other verdict which
doesn’t personally injure them. The Bulletin
pointed out that according to law there is no
necessity for fresh evidence to come to light
before an inquiry can be held into a prisoner’s
case, and it proved this statement by quoting
the exact words of the Act. Minister Gould
alleged that the statement showed “ ignorance
of the law and the absence of a legal training.”
But he didn’t dare to absolutely deny The
Bulletin’s assertion ; he couldn’t do that, with
the Act which this paper quoted staring him in
the face ; so he meanly scoffed at it by implica-
tion. Another remarkable item of Gould’s de-
fence is this :
The same paper alleged that Suffield would not sue
for mercy because that act would be construed as an
admission of guilt, and that he was being kept in prison
because of his attitude. Like all other prisoners who
behave themselves well while in gaol they were to receive
certain remissions, and these Suffield was to receive.
The Bulletin respectfully asks Minister Gould
if he ever knew an honest man shuffle in this
fashion. Suffield gets his remissions by gaol
regulations, like every other prisoner; but what
The Bulletin said was that Minister Gould’s
Department almost grovelled to Suffield by
making the special and extraordinary offer of
his freedom if he would petition for mercy,
and that a Minister’s Department dceui’t
generally act like that to a man whom it
believes to be guilty. But if a Minister, chiefly
because he is cold and dull and narrow
and hidebound, has persistently alleged that a
man is guilty simply because it is according to
office-precedent to do it; and then overwhelm-
ing evidence is adduced to show that the guilt
was never proved ; and the soulless official clod
can’t get far enough out of his official rut to
inquire into the matter, and yet he doesn’t
quite want to leave an innocent man in gaol—
then it is quite understandable that the minions
of this dull slave of routine should ask that
prisoner to kindly remove an awkward problem
out of the way by petitioning for mercy, and
being partly-pardoned all according to precedent.
And Minister Gould doesn’t dare to deny that
his Department begged Suffield in this extra-
ordinary fashion to get out. His statement
that .Suffield is entitled to remissions, like
any other prisoner, has no more bearing on the
question (the question whether Gould’s office
was or was not reduced to almost beseeching
its prisoner to admit his guilt and leave the
gaol, and say no more about it) than if he had
said that Suffield got the same food as any
other prisoner.
* * * •
And here is another amazing slab of Gould :
It was also alleged that the girl and her people had
been spirited away from the colony so as to prevent them
being examined should an enquiry be held, but the most
searching investigation proved that they, at different
periods (the mother and daughter going first, and the
father following some few months afterwards), took third-
class passages in a German liner for England, their pas-
sage-money costing £l4 per head. So from first to
last . . . the whole of the statements broke down
utterly.
Now Ihe Bulletin, at all events, never said
that the family of Suffield’s alleged victim
were “ spirited away so as to prevent them
being examined.” Minister Gould simply
puts in that alleged accusation. What it
said was that they went away for no
good visible reason just about the time the
first signs of a possible new inquiry into the
Suffield case appeared ; and Minister Gould
finds, after the most searching investigation,
that they did exactly what The Bulletin said
they did, and, having found that they did ex-
actly what The Bulletin said they did, he
sa / s disproves The Bulletin’s statements.
Also Minister Gould found, apparently, that
there was such haste to get the girl—the
only person interested—out of the way that
she was despatched some months before her
father was ready to start. But Minister
Gould apparently didn’t find out why these
people hastened away, or who supplied their
passage money, or any other really important
detail. Therefore, so far Mr. Gould has very
feebly dodged or evaded every one of The
Bulletin s statements, and answered none of
them, except by grossly mis-stating the law in
a certain matter. But the gem of the lot is to
follow :
t 0 * he conclusion that an offence had been
committed on the girl, Ann Chambers, and that if it was
not .Suffield who was the culprit the offence could not
have been committed.
I here could not have been an offence com-
mitted unless Suffield committed it. There-
fore, Suffield must be the only man in the
world, for in no other way could the existence
of an offence be a proof that Suffield was the
offender. And this is the case against Suffield
the best case that the pitiable little pettifogger
who refused Suffield an inquiry can make out
for his refusal.
PLAIN ENGLISH.
Gould and Garrard and Smith.
Now that the Reid Government has come back
to hang on to office by its last remaining tooth
it seems to be considered necessary to do some-
thing for these three cast-off Ministers, Gould,
Garrard and S. Smith. In 1895 Reid re-
turned from the country with an enthusiastic
mandate to radically reform the Upper House
and abolish the nominees who fester therein.
Then he appointed ten new life members—
including certain of his own rejected hangers-
on who couldn’t get seats in the Assembly, it
being the recognised principle of N.S.W.
politics that when the people refuse to have a
certain politician to boss them for three years
he should at once be appointed to boss
them for life. In 1898 Reid went to
the country as the man who was going
to so far reform the Council as to
appoint the fossils for a term of years instead
of for life. Barton and O’Connor went as ad-
vocates of an absolutely Democratic Council
elected on manhood-suffrage principles by the
whole province as one constituency. And the
Labor-party went as the advocates of no Upper
House at all—and, strangely enough, it howled
unanimously for the politician who was pledged
to preserve the nominee Upper House in its
ancient fossildom, and against the two leaders
who advocated manhood suffrage. Its enemies
allege that it threw' in its lot with the
fatted Tory as the price of the two fat
billets which he gave it on the Public
Works Committee—but that is a mere side
issue. Now the election is over, and the
Government following is a composite party
made up of the crowd which is pledged to
abolish the nominee Council, and the one which
is pledged to preserve it, merely reducing the
period of office ; and the crowd which is
pledged to preserve the nominee Council is so
weak that it is absolutely dependent for its
billet on the support of the crowd which is
pledged to utterly wipe out that institution.
Which brings us back in a circuitous fashion to
the three chucked-out Ministers, Gould and
Garrard and Smith. It is already understood
that Premier Reid, by way of showing his
yearning to reform the Council (just as he
showed it three years ago), is about to appoint
another batch of unreformed Councillors. They
are to be put in for life, just to show Reid’s crav-
ing to abolish the life tenure; and the Labor-
party, by whose grace Reid holds office, is to
be induced to acquiesce in the appointment of
a lot more Councillors, just by way of showing
its sincere desire to have no Councillors at all.
Gould and Garrard and Smith, being among
the bitter anti-Federalists of the Ministry—it
was Smith who invented, or first publicly cir-
culated, the outrageous tale about the Common-
wealth being liable for provincial bounties, by
way of his little effort to wreck the movement
—are, it is commonly understood, to be made
life legislators, by way of helping the Federal
movement along ! And the batch of new
M’s.L.C. is to be made up mostly of
Reid’s defeated followers, as one way of show-
ing the said Reid’s hunger after majority
rule—when the popular majority refuses to
have a man as its political boss on any terms,
as it did with Blanksby, Fowler, Daniel
O’Connor, and others of Reid’s appointment,
the correct thing, in the interests of majority
rule, is to make him one of the country’s rulers
for all the rest of his days. This is what,
according to the best available information, is
going to be done with Gould, and Garrard,
and Smith. When the popular majority, so
far as it can make itself heard, has deliberately
announced that it doesn’t want these anti-
Federalists at any price, because they are anti-
Federalists, the logical way to vindicate
majority rule, and to show a sincere yearning
after Federation and a profound desire to
abolish the life-nominee principle, is naturally
to make life-nominees of these bounced-out
anti-Federalists at once.

Victoria’s New Loan.
Premier Turner, from whom better things
were expected, starts borrowing again, and
Victoria is once more to be blessed with a
“ vigorous public works policy.” Still, the
fault is not wholly Turner’s. 'l’he present
Victorian Premier strove harder than any other-
politician of his time to keep his one nf the


Seven Drunk Provinces straight, but circum-
stances were against him. The people didn’t
actively support him; the people of this country
have lived so long by crawling to Bull for
financial assistance, and taking the great
national flat-iron round to the back-door of
Bull’s pawnshop, that they couldn’t under-
stand the man who wanted them to be honest
and independent. Then the Age, which lives
in the same old rut as the majority of the people,
and has got the same borrowing leprosy in its
soul, started to give Turner notice to quit unless
he borrowed. Victoria had about six tremen-
ous deficits in succession as the result of its
last borrowing policy, and got behind to the
extent of over £3,000,000 ; and when the
Turner Government stopped the downfall and
produced two small surpluses, and paid off
about £250,000 of the shortage, the country
unanimously remarked that “ the finances being
now squared ” it was time to resume borrow-
ing “ in moderation.” When the Australian has
paid off one-twelfth or so of his deficit he
always says proudly that “ the finances are
now squared,” and he can go on the razzle-
dazzle again. Victoria is certainly in urgent
need of a vast number of public works to
develope the country, and they must be paid
either out of borrowed money or out of re-
venue. There are abundance of new sources
of revenue which could be set aside for
the express purpose of feeding a Public Works
Fund—absentee-tax, 5 per cent, on the earn-
ings of a legalised tote, graduated land-tax, tax
on foreign insurance companies, the unclaimed
balances in banks, the proceeds of State lot-
teries and State tobacco monopoly, and other
things—but there are difficulties in the way.
Turner didn’t attempt any of them, for one
thing. The people and the press probably
wouldn’t have supported him if he had —they
certainly wouldn’t have supported him hard
enough to down the House of 48 Rich Landlords
in the fight that would necessarily have ensued.
In fact, the mere proposal to construct works
out of revenue instead of with borrowed money
has come to be regarded as a kind of sin in the
thriftless, begging land of Australia. And
then, while N.S. W. and Queensland and Wes-
tralia were creating an artificial boom with loan
moneys, these provinces attracted the bulk of
the new population—when three hotels are
giving free drinks and the fourth one isn’t,
that fourth one is always at a disadvantage.
So the end of it all is that Victoria, after a brief
attemptatsobriety, goes the usual way once more,
as the Australias always go. The inevitable
result, some day or other, will be default, and
then presumably the British creditor will de-
mand that Imperial officials shall be sent here to
receive the revenues, and grind out sufficient
taxation to pay the bill, which will be equiva-
lent to extinguishing Australia’s privileges of
self-government, and making it a British Crown
Colony with a bailiff in possession. Australia
reckons that it can’t exist without borrowing
now, despite its splendid land revenues and
gold yields, and the fact that it has no war
debt, no war damage to make good, and very
little military or naval expenditure. And by-
and-bye its land revenues will fade, and its
gold will give out, and it will have a big war-
liability to face some day or other —that sort of
thing happens to every country soon or late—
and it won’t be able to borrow any more, and it
will have a vastly larger interest bill to pay.
Then it will reflect sadiy on what a very tired
fool it was in the good old days that are never
coming back, and will lean up against the fence
and weep.
♦
The Papuan I.and Job.
The Papuan land-grab crowd, by way of adding
gall to previous insult, announces that it will,
by way of a concession to Australian public
feeling, kindly allow the people of this country
to take up shares n its great steal and swindle.
Australia pays for the government of British
Papua. According to law, N.S.W. and Vic-
toria are to have a voice in the management, by
way of return for their money, and this law
has been disgracefully broken, chiefly by the
dodges and wiles of the British Papuan syndi-
cate. Australian settlement is discouraged, and
Australians who desired to acquire land in the
province have been promptly thrown out. And
it is now suggested, as some kind of compensa-
tion for all these things, that the Australian
people should be allowed to entrust their money
to the care of Somers Vine, whose management
of the Imperial Institute certainly suggests that
he hasn’t the business capacity to run a pea-
nut barrow, and depend for the honest use
of their good red gold on the crowd which
has just engineered the biggest steal of recent
history. No person in his senses looks for
dividends out of the British Papuan steal co.
The profits will doubtless be large, but, after
the directors, and the management, and the
blackmailers, and the first and second and
third robbers, and the financiers and miscel-
laneous Hooleys, have been paid, all that the
ordinary shareholders are likely to get is calls.
West Australia is choke-full just now of com-
panies under British management, and every
wind blows their valueless scrip right across
this continent. Any Australian who wants to
trust his cash to the financiers of Bottomley-
Hooley Land in the face of recent revelations
should be a fit subject for an asylum. By the
way, the very latest view of the case is ex-
pressed in the following cablegram :
Mr. Chamberlain goes on to say that Queensland can-
not repudiate the agreement without a breach of faith;
but adds that, if three of the interested Governments
agree to amendments in the ordinance supplementary to
his own, and without touching the essence of the agree-
ment, he will endeavor to obtain the assent of the syndi-
cate.
Apparently the Macgregor Government in
Papua committed a gross breach of faith by
keeping the steal secret from the N.S.W. and
Victorian Governments ; and the Nelson-
Byrnes Government committed another breach
of faith by doing the same thing; and the
Lowles-Vine syndicate committed two gross
breaches of faith by inciting these two Govern-
ments to break faith with N.S.W. and Vic-
toria ; and it seems to have committed still
another by well, call it mollifying the
Governments of Papua and Queensland with
the right to nominate directors (presum-
ably well-salaried directors) on the co. But
the only thing which troubles Chamberlain is
that Queensland, having promised to diddle it,
two neighbors for the benefit of the syndicates
it would be very dishonorable and untruthful of
it not to diddle them according to promise. If,
as appears, the essence of the steal is to be car-
ried out, and it is only possible to get an altera-
tion in details, the best thing to do now is to
demand that the power of appointing certain
directors, said to be one of the terms of the
contract, be wholly taken away from the
Queensland and Papuan Governments. Sup-
posing they really sold their neighbors for the
sake of a few profitable billets for their little
brother Bill, then, for the discouragement of
future boodlers, they should lose the price of
their iniquity ; and, if their motives were abso-
lutely pure, which is quite possible, they have
at least shown such amazing foolishness that
they can’t be trusted to appoint a director of
an umbrella-shop. And both N.S.W. and
Victoria should stop payment of their annual
subsidy of £SOOO a year each to Papua, and
demand that N.S.W.’s “natural ally,” the
Queensland Government, shall hand back the
contributions from the two southern provinces
which are now lying in the Brisbane Treasury.
The idea of N.S.W. and Victoria paying £SOOO
a year each to keep afloat the province from
which they have been practically ejected is too
much joy.
Reid’s “Majority.”
According to the figures published in Sydney
Telegraph on Friday, July 29, the number
of votes recorded was—
Reid Party. Barton Party.
Sydney 28,809 Sydney 25,764
Country 31,752 Country 59,557
60,561 85,321
Labor Party. Independents.
Sydney 6,970 Sydney 1,846
Country 14,889 Country 1,946
21,859 3,792
Total: for the direct Federal party led by
Barton, 85,321 votes ; for the Reid party and
the Labor section put together, 82,420 votes.
And in the very same issue in which these
figures were published the mendacious organ of
shoddy and retrogression tried to raise its
dejected yell of triumph in these words :
As the question at the elections was simply one of
securing the elimination of Braddon’s blot, the three-
fifths majority, and other minor defects from the Conven-
tion Bill, naturally the country chose to place that work
in the hands of the party which had displayed the
greater sympathy for it. This was the party under the
leadership of Mr. Reid, who, before the Referendum,
denounced the objectionable clauses, when Mr. Barton
and his principal followers just as vigorously defended
them. Under the circumstances an intelligent com-
munity could make no other choice. Upon Mr. Reid now
devolves the obligation of doing justice to the position
in which he is thus placed, when, if election pledges are
to go for anything, he must command an overwhelming
support in the new House. If the Government re-
main true to themselves, and true to the country
upon Federation, their position is, therefore, un-
assailable by any part}' or combination of parties
which does not first turn its back on the pledges
that secured its election. Their enemies have unjustly
taunted them with being at heart opposed to Federation,
but the most persistent reiteration of that charge has
evidently failed to convince the people of its truth. From
the Government themselves, however, must, come the
absolute refutation of the calumny. And it must be
forthcoming in the form, not of clever speeches, but tan-
gible works. Upon their shoulders the country has cast
all the responsibility of immediate initiative for the pur-
pose of bringing the colonies together to discuss the
Federal situation, to which the elections have given new
and definite shape. In that they can claim not only the
support of their own majority, but of every member of
the House who recognises the obligation of keeping faith
with his constituents upon the main question at issue in
the elections. The country has made Mr. Reid leader of
the one great movement which it is the mission of this
Parliament to bring to a successful conclusion.
Truly the beautiful doctrine of majority rule
has a lot to put up with.
State Fire Insurance.
Regarding the State Fire Insurance idea,
which is now under consideration both in
Maoriland and S.A., a Maoriland Tory organ
wails as follows :—-
The State Fire Insurance Bill, so much talked about, is
not likely to develop into anything this session. There
are between 20 and 30 companies doing business in this
colony, and many would be certain to withdraw if a
scheme of State" fire-insurance were set up, but the
chances are decidedly against its adoption. Dividends of
10 to 15 per cent, are, at first glance, an incentive, but if
the State began the business its operations would neces-
sarily be confined to the colony, and it is doubtful
whether other offices would reinsure risks taken by the
Government. By the destruction of one large establish-
ment here not long ago private insurance companies were
struck to the amount of something like 130,000, hut the
risk was divided amongst a good many of them, and the
profits in other parts of the world were available for this
local disaster.
This one argument has lived and done good ser-
vice for a long time—a very long time when its
abject weakness is considered. The State Fire
Insurance office, as is quite correctly pointed
out, will do business in only one country while
the private office spreads over a large number.
Therefore, when the private office makes a big
loss in Maoriland its profits from abroad help
to pay the loss, and as the State office would
have no profits from abroad it would be at a
disadvantage. On the other hand, when the
private office makes a profit in Maoriland its
losses abroad help to eat up that profit, and the
State office, having no losses abroad, would be at
a great advantage. The State office might not
be able to reinsure its big risks—and it wouldn’t
need to, for it would have more capital behind
it than all the private‘offices in the country put
together, and could stand a bigger loss than all
of them combined. If Maoriland or S. A. under-
took State fire insurance, and compulsorily took
over the whole business, and charged premiums
20 per cent, lower than the private offices (the
saving effected in commissions, offices, direc-
torates, managements, &c., would enable it to
do that), and was just as badly managed as,
but no worse than, the average private
office, it would be a profitable spec, even
though it struck a £30,000 or a £IOO,OOO or
£200,000 loss now and then. Fire insurance
is a gamble with slight odds in favor of the co.
—the premiums are arranged that way. Tlie
gambler with odds in his favor always wins if
he lives long enough, and if he has cash enough
to stand occasional runs of bad luck. The
State lives longer than the private co., so it has
the advantage there. And the State, with its
public lands, powers of taxation, its capacity
for borrowing cheaply to tide over an emer-
gency, its power to issue paper-money and
other resources, could outlast a run of bad luck.
in the way of losses, which would break every
private company doing business in the seven
Provinces.
Hobnail Hallucination.
Parlous as are the alleged Labor-party s pros-
pects in Victoria at present, they threaten to
become almost hopeless. A brainless move is
addling in Trades’ Hall circles just now, the
object being to make the Vic. Labor movement
a purely “horny-handed” and trades-union-
officials’ one. At a meeting of the often-called
but seldom responding Labor party Council,
lately, Barrett and Hyman, the newly-elected
Trades’ Hall president, were only defeated byone
vote in an attempt to dissolve the “party” with a
view of substituting a purely Trades Hall one in
its place, and they succeeded in getting the
meeting postDoned until September, to allow
of the Trades" Hail drawing up a scheme mean-
while with the same object. It would be sad to
see the advanced Labor movement in Victoria
degenerate into a mere class coterie Properly
considered, the workers are not a class they
are the community ; and, accordingly, a true
workers’ movement commands and obtains the
aid of every Democrat in the community. But
a Trades Hall party, composed exclusively of a
section of manual workers, and confining its
representatives in Parliament, and elsewhere,
to Trades Hall officials, is worse than a class
movement ; it is a sect, and a vicious sect
at that. Singular to say, Ben Tillett,
who was constantly drumming into trades-
union ears the gospel of the solidarity of the
interests of brain and hand workers, had
scarcely left his applauding hearers before they
threw his advice to the winds and did
their little best to perhaps wreck the Demo-
cratic prospects of Victoria.
The Grand Duke and Duchess of Hesse
grandchildren of Queen Victoria, one being
the son of Princess Alice, the other the
daughter of the Duke of Edinburgh—lately
agreed to a permanent separation, which
is said to be the only point they have
agreed upon since their honeymoon year. lor
the information of many millions of ordinary
married couples this Hesse case ought to have
been brought into the divorce-court, and re-
ported at full length in all the European
evenin’ journals. The world at large would
like to know why the same palace—although it
is a small one as palaces go—wasn’t large
enough to hold the young couple in question at
such times as they both happened to be there.
Marriage is a failure in most cases, merely be-
cause circumstances compel the partners to
make one another tired. The monotony of
constant companionship brings discord into the
firm. Edwin and Angelina lack the means
to enable them to preserve a mutual attractive-
ness, and they drop into a hum-drum condition
of kindly indifference, or develop bitter
animosity, according to whether they are
“ fairly well matched,” or very much other-
wise. But a long continuance of pretty com-
pliments, airs and graces of sentimental “nice-
ness ” to one another is possible in all grades of
gilded wedlock, and seeing that a grand duke
and duchess are never obliged to meet under
strictly disenchanting conditions, the true his-
tory of this civil war in the Hesse household
would be a useful little volume.
The Annexation of Van Dobson Land.
“ J.D.” writes from a small island somewhere :
The suggestion that Victoria should annex Tasmania
has often been made, and once upon a time a strong
feeling in favor of the idea was held by many Tasmanians,
especially in the north-end of the island. But the so-far
insuperable bar is the insular cunning of a few one-
’possum-power folks who would rather reign in the hell
of Hobart than play second Addle in the paradise of
Melbourne, or any other place. These folks rule the
country. They are well versed in arguments against the
proposal, and when argument peters out t hey have only
to raise the Van Dobsonian edition of the Kiama Ghost
by 'rattling a pair of the rusty leg-irons which Victoria
wouldn’t tolerate even before they rusted—and immedi-
ately Tasmaniacs become violently anti-Vic. Even the
girls working in Tas. clothing factories, dressmakers’
rooms, milliners’ shops, and such, evince the most
lively antipathy towards importations of “ Mel-
bourne hussies,” as they call them. In the minds of
young Tasmania, Melbourne is the home of thugs, and
Tassy shearers travelling Riverina-wards via Mel-
bourne for the Arst time ke«p their pockets tightly but-
toned up, and get away from the accursed place by Arst
train. One man tells me that he and his party—all Arst-
timers—stood guard over their swags at Spencer-street
railway-station a whole night rather than risk murder at
an hotel or lodging-house. On the other hand, it is
not so long since Melbourne hotelkeepers locked
up the spoons directly a Tasmanian vessel entered
the Heads. When the memory of these silly old feuds
shall have departed with their authors, when the Van
Dobson traditions and the last pair of leg-irons have
been collared by foreign curio-hunters, Tasmania may
agree to unite with Victoria. But at present a few boss
islanders are bent upon retaining the sovereignty of their
belated but beloved flyspeck unto the fourth generation.
“ A Mere Male ” to The Bulletin
The Turner Government’s Woman’s Franchise Bill
proposes to effect its object by repealing the word
“male” in certain electoral clauses of the Constitution
Acts, and by enacting that, in matters relating to electors,
the masculine shall include the feminine. There is no
provision enacting that a woman shall vote only once.
If carried in this form, as is possible, and if the
One-man-one-vote Bill fails to pass, as is likely, another
addition will have been made to the rampant pluralism
of Victoria. It will be worse than the present system
on account of the enormous number of allotments of
land, scattered everywhere, which have been transferred
into the names of women to save them from the conse-
quences of the collapse of the land-boom, and the
clutches of insolvency trustees. It is to be hoped that
Vic. Democrats will not be misled by hopes of passing the
other Bill into allowing the Woman’s Franchise Bill to
leave the Assembly without a stringent One-woman-one-
vote clause being added to it.
Premier Byrnes unfolded, the other day, what
he called the “policy” of the coming session.
It consisted principally of something vague
about educational matters (University in parti-
cular) ; an increase in local endowments, to
meet which no additional taxation is to be
imposed ; and a scheme to test the wishes of
the province re electoral reform by means of a
Referendum. This last device is about the
most characteristic thing Byrnes has yet in-
vented. The Referendum is to be taken next
election, and, of course, only the present pos-
sessors of the franchise vote. And, inasmuch
as the property-vote is a mighty thing through-
out the length and breadth of Bananaland, it
stands to reason that every allotment-peg will
be hurled violently at the heads of electoral
reformers, and the poor, disfranchised devils in
the Bakblox and elsewhere, who take no part
in the Referendum business, will continue dis-
franchised. Thereupon Byrnes, " the Liberal,
will advance to the footlights, bow gracefully
to the audience, and remark : “ Gentlemen,
here you have the first act of my great Demo-
cratic Drama —the Referendum ! How do you
like it ? ” Bah !
A massive person with a square jaw was the ob-
ject of many nasty remarks at Melb. City Court,
the other day. He was charged with threaten-
ing the life of his wife, and the wife’s lawyer had
prevailed upon Panton, P.M., five days before,
to release the accused on bail. The lawyer’s
remarks before the court showed he was sorry
he spoke. He asserted that since his release
accused had again threatened to shoot his wife,
had brandished a revolver about, and had
twice chased the solicitor himself with intent
to deal out vigorous stoush. The wife did not
appear, and Panton, P.M., made a number of
observations to the effect that prisoner was a
most undesirable person to be going about, and
a man who urgently required to be Put Down.
It was mentioned by the prosecution as in-
tensifying the evil that the parties had
been married only a fortnight when the row
commenced, and the Court apparently agreed
that this was a further aggravation of a very
aggravated kind of brutality. Then it casually
transpired that they had lived together for
four years previous to their marriage, and the
Court’s sympathy froze up. It made no more
nasty remarks. It didn’t fine or imprison the
massive person, and he was simply turned
loose. Which argues a very curious state
of the judicial mind—a state which can go
into these few propositions : (1) If a man
and woman live together without mar-
riage, it argues such wickedness on the
woman’s part that she may be ill-used with
impunity ; (2) Also, it argues such noble
qualities on the man’s part that he has privi-
leges—in the way of harrying the woman and
attempting to stoush her legal representative
which are not enjoyed by the ordinary person ;
(3) The woman who isn’t orthodoxly Respect-
able may be stoushed gratis.
Justice usually blushes when she hears of
Melb. City Court. Indecencies of method and
libels on fairplay are of weekly occurrence
there—so common, in fact, as to be passed with
a shrug when obtruded on one’s notice. “ It’s
the way of the beast, you know.” But a
recent instance, said to be the practice for
years, recalls the convict system. British law
pretends to consider a man innocent until he is
proved guilty. The police view of the matter
is that a man is guilty till he is proved inno-
cent. But Melb. City Court goes one better
and reckons a man guilty if he is proved inno-
cent. A man was, it seems, charged with
some offence and held guilty. Then previous
convictions were called for as usual; and this
court had the front to allow various instances
where the man had been acquitted to be read
out as previous convictions !
The sugar-industry in Queensland is Honey-
combed with abuses (writes a well-informed
Northern correspondent to The Bulletin).
Most of the land mortgaged to Govt, on
account of the Central Mill system is the pro-
perty of men who don’t grow a stick of cane
but lease their acres to tenant farmers often
under conditions of unspeakable severity. Bled
by high rents and royalties, these poor devils
regard the prospect of losing black labor as the
very acme of all misfortunes, and the landlords
play this feeling for all it is worth. Then the
Colonial Sugar Refining Co. comes along and
dictates its terms. So much shall be the out-
put of a certain class of sugar ; such-and-such
shall be the price; in Australasian markets
only shall the growers compete. In case of re-
fusal a threat from the C.S.R. Co. to flood
the market with Chinese and Javanese sugars
brings the stubborn grower to his knees with a
mournful “Peccavi.” Result : The small Q.
growers are getting more and more involved
every day, and the Central Mill system, for
want of its complement of a Central Refinery,
is being engineered, quietly and unobtrusively,
for the benefit of the gigantic monopoly afore-
said. Had Q. Govt, taken over the Q.N.B.’s
Millaquin refinery at Bundaberg—as a partial
compensation of its claims, the transaction
would have been a blessing to the district.

“ Seven-by-Seven ” tells The Bulletin things
about the Salvation Army
Dear Bulletin. —Let one who has studied the Army for
10 years say something’. The “ Harmv ” poses as a
brother-and-sisterhood, of assistance to each other and to
humanity in general ; and, as a close student of their
operations in N.S. Wales, I must acknowledge they do far
better work than any of the churches—even if it is m
an open-air style. Nevertheless, their organisation is
full of abuses. Example : The head-officers live in clover;
most of their time seems to be spent in travelling first-
class on the railways, with an occasional trip on a
£2O “bike.” This big officer gets nicely quartered
wherever he drops in, is clad in fine raiment,
and never wants for a “ bob.” We have no direct proof
that he is a hard grafter, except praying can be counted
in. Now, take the struggling captain, and his or her
skinny lieutenant. A married captain’s pay is £1 15s.
per week, and a single one’s, male or female, £1 Bs.
Lieutenants (always single) have 15s. But these stipends
are dependent on collection. No collection—no salary!
Hence the intense collecting zeal. You must first pay
your barracks-rent and kerosene-bill, and if you have
your screw left, you are entitled to it—not otherwise.
I have known a" hard-working female captain (good-
looking, too, and that means a lot) get as little as 6d. per
week, "and her lieutenant 4d. ! (as per account-books
shown to the writer). Also, in same town, the barracks,
built with money collected in that town, are owned by
head-quarters (though God knows where the legality of
the claim comes in), and though H.Q. never contributed
a farthing to the erection of the building, it claims the
rent (255.) and starves the captain. No use denying it!
The writer is prepared to furnish the name of the town.
Again, in another town, the single captain had to take to
his former occupation of shearing. He made £2O, but he
dared not keep it. It went to the treasury.
Reported that Goschen and Chamberlain
want to hold a conference to arrange for regular
contributions by the “colonies” to the British
defence forces. These little things always happen
after the Australian Premiers have been beguiled
to a Jubilee and mollified by free lunch and drinks
and a title apiece. The next stupendous free
lunch will probably be at the coronation of
Edward VII. or George V.,and it would be a
wise thing to take the approaching grovel by the
forelock, and enact that any Premier who shall
go more than 6000 miles in a straight line from his
province during bis term of office, shall lose Ins
seat and his portfolio, and be incapacitated W»
holdiner office for five years.

“ Sweet Nancy ” is to run one week only
at Her Majesty’s (Sydney), and the reasons why
it shouldn’t run any longer stick out like the nose
of a great drunk in a prohibition land. Most ot the
good points about the show are supplied by the
company; the alleged comedy has very few
of its own. It begins badly by being an adapta-
tion of a thin and gushy and girly novel by a thin
woman, and it ends badly by being a fluffy little
thing about nothing in particular. Ihe heroine,
aged 20 and wearing a pinafore, is proposed to by
an elderly general in Act I, and accepts him with
the full and infuriated approval of her awful
father—a bitter, stumpy man in a perpetual
passion. In Act 11. a lady friend with a won-
drous hat calls on the general, and the first gleam
of green jealousy wakens like a serpent s tooth
(mixed metaphor) in the fluffy wife’s soul. And
iu Act 111. the general comes back from a cam-
paign with a faint suspicion that his wife has been
flirting with another fellow in his absence, but the
matter being explained without the slightest diffi-
culty, he doesn’t even mention his suspicion to his
fluffy charmer, and the curtain comes down on a
view of a happy home. It is about the slenderest
thing possible in the way of a story.
* * • *
“ Sweet Nancy ” is meant as a one-woman
play, and The Bulletin mentions with tears that
that woman is a disappointment. Pattie Browne
docs the part with a waste of yellowish hair which
doesn’t suit her worth a cent; and the pinafore
doesn’t go well with that wilderness of dull gold
locks ; and her voice is a monotone with some-
thing suggestive of tears in it all the time, and
though she is good in spots there are (alas !) other
spots. This paper’s conclusion is that Pattie is
utterly wasted in this weak little girl-drama with
jam on it. Almost everyone else, however, does
well, and among them “Nancy” gets more show
than it deserves. Miss May Browne, as Nancy s
sister, aged 15 and consisting mostly of legs,
is good all through. Cecil Ward, as a pain-
ful lout of a large brother who maunders
after the siren with the big hat, is just
about perfect. Cecil W. has a capacity for
playing the painful big brother, which developed
in the davs when he was a member of the B. and
B. co., and one of his brightest successes was when
he came home to the parental mansion of Brough,
and brought with him an unexpected wife whose
mother kept an Irish lodging-house, and briefly
explained things by saying that he “ dunno.
Miss Therese Lindahl looks a beautiful and be-
guiling siren in the big, wild hat ; Sweeney is
very real and very effective as the square-jawed
parent whose wrath blows in a perpetual blast of
loud remonstrance ; Miss Juno is a pale, crushed
mother who always comes at a hard canter when
father Sweeney calls for her, and these and a few
other people call for more kind things than space
admits of. Among them they should manage to
support “ Sweet Nancy” till jriday night, unless
that fragile thing tears itself up and blows away.
. • • *
“A Bit. of Old Chelsea ” in one act is as
sketchy as the other piece, but it is more novel
and less girly and gushy, a,nd in it Pattie Browne
fully retrieves her reputation. It starts by Cecil
Ward looking out of his window on the foggy
night before his marriage and seeing a flower-girl
faint on the pavement. When he brings her in
and revives her with “korfy ” and victuals, she is
so overwhelmingly grateful that she stays and
sleeps on the premises, revealing a very large hole
in the heel of her left sock as she goes to bed.
After Ward has thrown out three of his oldest
friends (who have dropped in casually and made
reflections on his morals through finding a female
hat on the premises) he goes to sleep in a chair
with his clothes on. And in his sleep he murmurs
the name of his bride till the flower-girl can stand
it no longer. Therefore she gets out of bed,
revealing a large hole in her left sock, and silently
sticks her last remaining flowers round the sleep-
ing benefactor who gave her the “ korfy, and
goes. She goes weeping, but she puts her old
crushed hat on her head as one having authority
and not as the scribes, and leaves her dream be-
hind her. Pattie Browne’s flower-girl is a clever
study and a work of art, and is worth all of Nancy
many times over. Cecil Ward and J. S. Ryan do
good work as the rest of the show; and George
Melville and Fred Cambourne are also in it for a
moment, but are thrown out so quickly for making
immoral remarks about the hat that they can
hardly be said to be really in.

On Saturday, “Jane” begins to ensue at

The “White Heather” will bloom at
Sydney Royal for a little while longer, but though
business is still good it is understood that the days
of that fleeting vegetable are numbered. No new
developments in the undressing of Lady Godiva
have taken place since last week, and, considering
that that lady has been very short of things to
put on during the coldest part of the winter, this
paper has grave fears that she may get bronchitis
in the limbs. At all events, there is no Godiva in
the new production now in preparation, so the
shapely lady will at last have a chance to put her
clothes on and get warm. And when she does she
will be missed by a large number of friends, who
have grown deeply attached to Miss Gill in her
present scarce but picturesque attire, and would
fain have her remain that way indefinitely.
*« * *
A deranged lady with a marriage-cer-
tificate, who tries to drive the road-engine over
her rival’s prostrate form, at Sydney Lyceum,
will drop that bulky piece of mechanism late on
Friday night. On Saturday, the MacMahon firm
intends producing “ Right’s Right a drama
which isn’t so bad as its awkward name might
suggest. And, until then, Diver will plant the
bomb under the caravan every night, at 11, and
the ruins of that tenement will fall punctually on
Frank Hareourt and his dreadful old woman three
minutes later. As for the dishonest girl, wh®
shows such a large amount of a very interesting
personage through the rents in her frock, the ruins
don’t fall on her because she has run right out of
the drama a minute earlier and disappeared. One
of the woes of melodrama is that, as soon as the
bad man is arrested, it drops all the other charac-
ters just when the audience is beginning to get
acquainted with them.

The two pretty Yankee girls are a great
“draw” at the Tivoli. Yankeedom has lately
gone mad over itself, and, besides wearing stars-
and-stripes bathing-gowns, pyjamas, slippers and
neckties, the johnnies and damsels of New York
have introduced a new dance, the “ Dewey deux,”
in which a great deal of stars and stripes are
shown. When the Govell sisters unfurl their red
parasols it is seen that the insides are lined with
the British flag, which adds a very smart finish to
their costumes. There is a good deal of reminis-
cence about their performance. Their Yankee song
closely resembles in parts the “ American Million-
aire’s Daughter ” ; in appearance they recall, in a
marked degree, Ivy Scott and Carrie Moore as
the mashers ; while their dancing is on very similar
lines to Coleman’s.
** * #
“ The Sign of the Cross ” revival at Melb.
Princess’s doesn’t go with the semi-religious boom
of its original production. This slump in public
enthusiasm is no doubt surprising to many people,
and yet easily explained. Wilson Barrett visited
Melbourne in between the two “ Cross ” seasons.
The public have discovered him to be a preachy
showman, instead of the commanding genius and
lofty moral-lessoner they were led to expect. They
saw him in a succession of plays wherein the
heroine lost her “ honor,” or swore she hadn’t lost
it, or was slain in defence of it, under seriously
moral circumstances—“ Claudian,” “The Manx-
man,” “ Ben-my-Chree,” and “ Virginius,” not
to mention Shakespeare’s “Othello.” And by
degrees the average person awoke to the fact that
Barrett’s “Sign of the Cross” was merely his
giddiest show beautifully mounted and clothed in
scriptural phrase and holy anachronisms. The
present scoffer remarked last year that “Sign of
the Cross ’’was designed to “ tickle ignorance.”
Concerning Wilson Barrett’s dramatic methods
there is not much ignorance to tickle nowadays,
and so the handsome spectacle at the Princess’s
doesn’t flourish again to quite the great extent of
olden times. Seen for the third or fourth time it
appears an unconvincing piece of Roman legend
highly suitable for the oily brethren of some holy
sect or other. A striking contrast to “ Prisoner
of Zenda,” which wholesome romantic story of
self-sacrifice seems to improve on acquaintance.
V * • *
True, “ The Sign ” has suffered somewhat
from alterations in the cast. The first Nero was
an interesting old picture of a prematurely-aged
pagan ; the present Nero is a much younger man
who looks like the other one, and tries to act and
talk like him, but without much success. His
lusty roaring doesn’t harmonise with the assump-
tion of physical decay. He is in nowise a genuine
potentate. On the other hand, the new, small
Christian (Miss Annie Cubitt) is somewhat more
feminine than Miss Neilson, and she has live-
lier legs, and her shriek of agony is shriller
than the scream of the previous Stephanus.
By the way, Julius Knight and Miss Ferrar
appear to have lost weight, but not in
an artistic sense, the lady especially being
more effective than before. If Mrs. Morris
has taken over the part of Berenis for good, she
will get along pretty well with it, no doubt; but
last time the writer of this notice saw Berenis he
found Mrs. M. a weak substitute for Miss Page.
Also she was being overshadowed by the
boisterous affectations of Miss Raymond.
Miss Raymond is an intelligent actress and a
pleasing vision, but her forced accent of gaiety
palls upon the ear. It is not amusing. The wildly
amusing person in this show is good old Newton
Griffiths as Metellus “terrible Mt-tellus,” as
Berenis calls him. When the rampageous Griffiths
strikes a heroic attitude the present scribe recalls
to mind his long-ago lecturing on “ The Crimes of
Deeming ” at Melb. Waxworks. Then was the
time to hear Metellus at his terriblest. He would
discourse on Deeming, and paint word-pictures of
corpses festering under the hearthstone until the
perspiration streamed off his nose.

Biondi continues to crowd the Opera
House. On Saturday night every seat in the d.c.
was booked, and the soul of Rickards dances to
the merry chink of sixpence extra. All the same,
Biondi is to change his programme next Saturday,
therefore anyone who wants to see that remark-
able young man chasing himself in the four differ-
ent characters of husband, wife, lover and man-
servant, is advised to struggle fora coign of vantage
without delay. The advt. doesn’t state whether
Biondi will introduce a new lot of musical con-
ductors. The Bulletin hopes not. Verdi, Suppe,
Liszt, Gounod, Donizetti, Sullivan and co. are
visions that court further inspection, and can be
enjoyed once a week, regularly, for an indefinite
period. The first effect of them is astonishment,
chiefly. Their humorous points of difference are
much more apparent to the eye that has grown
used to them, and custom doesn’t stale the infinite
variety of Biondi with the bfiton.

Melb. Royal will remain closed until the
end of this month, it seems. Also, the Bijou has
ceased to invite patronage. On Monday of last
week the nominal manager packed up his port-
manteau and went away. This is about the sixth
Melbourne co. that has mourned a loss within the
past few months, and the saddest feature of all
this gone-bung show business is the fact that the
landlords generally had the best of the calamity.
The Bulletin wants to hear of a dramatic season
in which everybody got paid except the person
who could best afford to lose a little.

John Coleman grafted some comic songs
upon Newbury’s “ Pop ” concert last Saturday,
and the same lean and nimble will repeat the out-
rage once a week till further notice. The musical
critics of the respectable papers are understood to
feel Coleman’s contributions very keenly, whereas
the public which pays its nimble shilling appeared
to accept the outrage with joy. Anyway, New-
bury will run the Town Hall show for a few more
weeks. Coghill’s show, at the Gaiety, is flourish-

At Poverty Point.
Damp sheets proved the extremity of Leslie Thompson,
the imported “ Little Minister,” and the opportunity of
his substitute, Cecil Ward. Unaired bedclothes doubled-
up the new arrival for consequent weeks of sickness in a
private hospital. A fellow-patient at same time was Mrs.
Besant-Seott, daughter of eloquent Annie Besant.
During the last week of a certain recent theatrical
season, a large number of “ stiffs” were scattered around.
These accumulated, and were nearly all presented on the
last night but one of the season, when the police
threatened to summon the manager for over-crowding.
Fancy a £5 fine for over-packing a house with paper !
“Mahlstick”: Having met Mrs. Hazelwood (Miss Ada
Reeve) off the boards, I must politely join issue with the
contributor who appears to regard her (stage-presence) as
very made-up. A daintier little woman does not step in
kid.
“Paradis”: Of course, Musgrove has been in com-
munication with Eleonora Duse. She has conquered
more territory than Bernhardt, ranging over Rome,
Vienna, Berlin, St. Petersburg, Madrid, Stockholm, Lon-
don, Paris, New York, Chicago, ’Frisco.
Some members of an Australian co. are said to have
amused themselves one night, a while ago, by muddling
their lines and playing the fool generally' in order to
agonise the author (a local man), who was seated in the
stalls. The mummers had been nursing a grievance
against the author. He didn’t shout for the crowd before
the piece was staged. The Bulletin mentions this inci-
dent by way of advising any future Australian dramatists
to provide unlimited beer at rehearsal.
Frank Muevicars, one of the ancient Scotch elders in
“The Little Minister,” is a B.A. of London University.
Also he has played for England in international Rugby
football matches.
An Adelaide correspondent writes that William Pauli
knocked the holy city kile-kigh as King Henri in Ma Mie
Rosette. The local girls couldn’t raise a quorum at the
W.C.T.U. meeting for two weeks.
Old Martin Simonsen turned up at Melb. Police-court
the other day in connection with a revolver, with which,
it was alleged, he had mounted guard over his landlord’s
bed-room door for hours, causing that person irksome
confinement and much bodily fear, and, notwithstanding,
Martin alleged that it was only his play. The beaks
thought he might as well be bound over to keep the
peace. But Martin, deprived of his shooter, can still
easily get back on his landlord with his fiddle.
Carlyle Smythe, the Somewhat Travelled, has settled
down in Europe. He is just now editing an English
paper in Brussels. C.S. does not care for the show busi-
ness, and prefers to live by his decidedly clever pen.
When a certain pert little actress gets back to London,
she will take action for damages against a well-known
poet, novelist and dramatist. Said dramatist sold the
little lady the Australian rights of a comedy for a good
sum, and when she got out here she found that he had
sold the rights to the Firm, whom she had to pay before
she could produce the comedy. In fact, the author had
somehow or other inadvertently sold the Australian
rights twice over.
“ S.S.” : Although Coleman has received Australian
credit for the invention of the Scarecrow Dance, it is
really quite a venerable turn, and was danced all through
England years ago by Ashcroft, the Solid Man. Ash-
croft, who died about 12 years back, was a big favorite in
his time. [But Coleman in musical comedy has proved
himself a most brilliant original pessimistic humorist.—

“ Piper Findlater, V.C., has refused to accept the post
of one of Her Majesty s gate-keepers, which the War
Ottice secured for him in consideration of his leaving the
variety stage. Findlater argues, no doubt, that if
Major-Generals and others—who hire themselves out to
promoters as guinea-pigs and decoy the British public
into sinking its hard - earned money in mining and
banking swindles—are not acting in conflict with ‘ the
best traditions of the Army,’ he is certainly within his
rights in playing the pipes at a public entertainment.
And Findlater is more than justified in thinking so.”—
London Critic. The Critic, by the way, is the most
beautifully-outspoken and irreverent paper which has
been printed in London within The Bulletin’s recollec-
tion. It doesn’t wait for the tottering of a wholesale
rogue to kick him ; it kicks him while he is in full blast-
just when he is entering the temple with a £5 orchid in
his buttonhole. From an Australian standpoint the
Critic’s mining information and comments are exception-
ally honest and reliable.
Opalopolis has gradually become so respectable that
certain rtsqui songs much favored in most mining towns
are strictly tabooed there, and when a Sydney gap-filler,
pressed into service of a variety company there, came out
on his “ own,” the other night, with one of the forbidden
ditties, he was received with painful silence and subse-
quently howled off the stage.
After all, there is some excuse for the scornful sneers
of musical artists, when newspaper critics hurt their
vanity. “ Good ” notices are often ridiculously irritating
to the very people who are getting fulsome praise. A
Melb. daily said of one member at a recent Pop. concert :
“ Madame Spada and Mr. Newbury were happily com-
bined, and as Margherita and Faust respectively made a
reciprocal declaration of love — in Italian— with charac-
teristic dramatic power.” Thefe was a mosquito in this
ointment, as it happened. They sang their duet in Eng-
lish, not Italian, and considering that both of them
enunciated their words clearly enough the mistake in the
notice suggests that the “ critic ” didn’t pay attention, or
was deaf, or had gone out to get a drink.
“Haresfoot” : “Sweet Nancy” is a reminder of the
cruel saying that a woman is as old as she looks, and a
man as old as he feels. The physiologist seems to back
up the man who demands that two wives shall divide his
life. No woman can wrestle with, and throw, Dame
Nature, but men—well, look at even the old-fashioned
veterans like Butters. A quarter of a century makes no
difference in them.
S.W. : “ It is not in consonance with the traditions of
the British army,” says Lord Wolseley, “ that Piper Find-
later should appear in a public entertainment so shortly
after he has been decorated.” The “ consonance ” con-
sists in a pension on which a man can’t live, a gift of half-
a-pound of tobacco and a parade of infirmities, when a
sovereign has lived in palaces for 60 years, 6d. a day for
ex-soldiers over 60 years of age who retired with a
clean defaulter-sheet, and the brand of “ swaddy,” which
is erroneously supposed to mean “ vagrant.” And so the
traditions of the elders prevent the piper that played be-
fore Mars from earning peaceful, instead of blood-stained,
money. But the “traditions” don’t prevent officers from
“ appearing in a public entertainment” after killing a few
niggers. I’ve “ been there.”
“ Hai':sfoot ” : George Majeroni is again in Melb., with
the “ Sign of the Cross” co. The last Nouvf.llb Revbb,
in a paper on Italian actresses, evoked by Duse's bril-
liant Parisian success, gives me some idea of his illus-
trious lineage. His father, splendid actor that he was,
only ranked second of the Majeroni brothers, now repro-
duced, as to appearance, by George and Mario. The
chief Majeroni appeared with Madame Ristori, in
the most celebrated performance ever given in
Italy, “ Francesca di Rimini,” for the Dante centenary.
Our esteemed Madame Majeroni, mother of George and
Mario, is daughter of the great Adelaide Ristori’s sister,
Caroline Tessero, whose other daughter, Adelaide Tessero,
ranked next to Ristori amid Italian actresses.
A comedian, part of whose stock-in-trade is a stolid
expression of countenance, sometimes achieves unex-
pected results. This happened to Johnnie Coleman
when farewelling at Melb. Opera House. He confided to
the audience that he would return in six months’ time
with his mother, in such a hushed tone of voice, and with
such an expressionless face, that almost all thought they
were being regaled with a new witticism, and screamed
with laughter. However, all Melbournians have adored
Coleman ever since he was a Scarecrow in “ Djin-Djin,”
and will welcome him —and his mother—with open arms
when they come out.

Be the galvanized-tank question. Short
time ago, a number of young Killarney trout
were conveyed from the Darling Downs to Bris-
bane in galvanized - iron troughs, filled with
water. The trout all died. The experiment was
repeated shortly after, but wooden troughs were
used. All the fish were removed successfully.
Not conclusive, of course, but it looks bad for
galvanized iron.
N.S.W. Attorney-General will probably
give special consideration to the remarkable Budin
case tried last week before Judge Simpson. The
wife of George Budin, a steamboat fireman living
at Parramatta, charged her husband with having
maliciously set fire to the house in which she, her
child, and her sister were sleeping, and told a
story—backed up by her sister—to the effect that
Budin had lit kerosened palliasses under the
house, with amazing corroborative detail. Budin
explained that the palliasses had been put under
the house for the dog to lie on, and might have
been lit by sparks from the wash-house fire. Mrs.
Budin’s story was badly damaged by independent
witnesses, and the jury acquitted defendant. If
the jury’s verdict is correct, the lying on Mrs.
Budin’s side was marvellous. Emphatically, the
case should not rest where it is.
The results of the contests for several
N.S.W. constituencies have given another weighty
argument in favor of Federation. The necessity
of" a National Parliament has been conclusively
proved—a Parliament for men like Barton, R. E.
O’Connor, Wise, M'Millan and Bruce Smith, who
are not wanted in the N.S.W. House of Culverts.
Just imagine all those men being defeated (with
the exception of Wise who just managed to
squeeze in by five votes), whilst “ Jim ” Hayes
and “ Jim ” McFarlane were actually put in un-
opposed ! Just imagine J. Culvert Watson beat-
ing Statesman O’Connor by nearly 400 votes, and
the “ wonderful ” Wilks getting elected by a simi-
lar overwhelming majority. And just imagine
those awful political specimens Barnes, Affleck,
Sleath, &c., coming up serenely election after
election, whilst Edmund Barton just as con-
sistently goes down. Let us give another whoop
for Federation and down with the House of
Culverts !
The gem of N.S.W. general election was
the candidature of one Amein, a Hindoo chutnev-
maker, whom a Surry-hills gang of humorists
apparently had at the end of a string. They
jokingly inflicted on him all sorts of indignities,
but the dark man was in deadly earnest, and kept
on to the last, polling 8 votes. Here is his address
to the electors :
ELECTORS OF COOK WARD.
VOTE FOR
S. R. AMEIN,
TITE WORKING MAN’S FRIEND.
I WORK MYSELF. I FEEL FOR WORKING MEN.
I am an Independent Protectionist, and in favor of
Federation—but not the present Bill.
It is my idea that you should select, your member from
your own division. If you want to see me you can see
me day or night. If you vote for a man not living in
your own Division you cannot see him till next election.
My ideas will be new to Australia. I do this to help my
fellow-electors.
If you put me in I shall receive £3OO a year, but my
idea i's to keep £2OO for my expenses, and agree to put
£lOO in the Crown-street Savings Bank. The £lOO to be
spent in case of any accident occurring in the Cook
Division—the wife of an injured man to receive £lO from
the fund during the time he is incapacitated. _
Another thing, my dear friends, I havebeen in this
country 19 years, and always in the Cook Division. For
God’s sake vote for your own neighbour, as it will be very
useful in the future. Take no notice of my color, for the
same God who made me made you. The main thing is to
look at my principle. My home is of an English character,
and I always employ European labor.
I hope you will put in a Protectionist Government, as
it will give employment to 300 hands taken from Cook
Division.
If you return me, I will pass three Bills that will sur-
prise the world.
Gentlemen, put me in, and on Sunday you will have
plenty of bread, a good leg of mutton, and a good glass
of beer ; and on Monday you will have your landlord’s
rent. . , , ,
For God’s sake, do not take the hook by the oover, but
Vote for S. R. Amein, your own,neighbor.
S. AMEIN.

The WILD CAT
COLUMN
‘The Victorian revenue for the year ended 30th
June, 1898, was £6,886,664, and the ordinary expenditure
£6,701,094. This leaves a surplus of £185,570 to go in re-
duction of the grand old deficit. Also the receipts from
mallee lands (£11,000) are not taken into general revenue
but are set apart every year in reduction of the debt, so
the deficit has been reduced during the year by £196,754
and now stands at £2,906,881 all told. During the year
the public debt was increased by only £27,000 (as com-
pared with about £2,558,000 in N.S.W.), which is a pretty
solid guarantee that the Victorian accounts were not
cooked by charging ordinary expenditure to loans, seeing
there were practically no loans to charge it to. Next year
Treasurer Turner thinks he sees his way with certainty to
a surplus of £33,910 (revenue, £6,907,439, and expendi-
ture, £6,873,529). This means that he expects the whole
year’s revenue to be £20,775 more than last year’s, and as
the first three weeks of the financial year supplied £lO,OOO
of the expected increase he ought to get there all right.
The borrowing curse starts again in Victoria.
Within the next three years it is proposed to spend
£1,515,170 of permanent loans, and £1,031,700 of tem-
porary loans to be repaid out of revenue at the rate of
£25,000 a year. Premier Turner talks of a possibility of
raising £1,000,000 of his loan in Victoria, but if there is
anything in the theory about the exceeding richness of
this great and rich country he ought to be able to get the
whole of it there. If Victoria can’t hunt up £2,500,000
of its own cash to lend on good security in three years it
had better close the front door and give up business.
However bad local borrowing may be it is vastly better
than the foreign article. And so long as the money is
spent in the country all the local borrowing that can be
done doesn’t reduce the local cash supply, therefore by
simply keeping the Treasury door open and letting the
local lenders dribble the money as suits them it should be
possible to get all that is wanted. But if Turner wants to
give the experiment a fair chance he should either exempt
the local bond-holder from income-tax like the foreign
one, or tax the foreign one the same as the local one.
When the local holder pays Bd. in the £ of his
interest as income-tax and the foreigner doesn’t,
local loan-flotation doesn’t get a fair show. Also
as, in addition to what the Government makes in income-
tax, local borrowing saves about £1 3s. per cent, in
expenses, and the cost of remitting interest, and manage-
ment ex’s in London as well, and the State collects
probate-duty on the value of the bonds when the holder
dies, it would probably be cheaper in the end to pay £3
2s. 6d. per cent, interest locally than £3 per cent, in
London.
One notable feature is that Turner apparently
doesn’t commit himself (now that the Shiels bonds are
paid off) to any definite annual payment in reduction of
the deficit. Seemingly it takes its chance of being paid
out of surpluses, and the most probable end will be that
the last half of it will be finally dumped into the perman-
ent debt when the country gets too dead tired to hear any
more about it. A good part of the Queensland and S. A.
deficits have already gone that way.
* * * *
South Australia’s deficit for the year ended 30th
June, 1898, is officially reported as being £32,328.
Revenue, £2,566,611; expenditure, £2,598,939.
* * * •
Tasmanian revenue for July, .£68,319, as com-
pared with £66,338 for July, 1897—an increase of £l9Bl.
For the seven months (Tasmania starts its financial year
on Ist January) things are £53,774 better than they were
last year.
* * • *
Queensland reckons its revenue for July as being,
roughly, £295,000— an increase of about £lB,OOO as com-
pared with July, 1897.
* • * *
Westralia begins its new financial year badly,
the July revenue being £157,815 as compared with
£174,759 for July, 1897—a fall of £16,944.
* * * *
Westralia’s <£1,000,000 3 per cent, loan was a
ghastly failure, only £550,000 being subscribed at about
£94. The expenses will run to about £1 4s. per cent, at
the least, so the money will really cost not far short of
3j per cent, when allowance is made for the loss on re-
payment. Premier Forrest puts a brave face on the
matter, and says he doesn’t really need the full million,
but with those 200 odd miles of water-pipes to Cool-
gardie and all the other works to pay for, to say nothing
of the deficit and the falling-off in revenue, he probably
wants it worse than anything else in this universe. Any-
how it looks as if Westralia’s credit has really fallen below
the 3 per cent, standard, and it will soon have to raise its
terms.
* * * *
The A. J.S. Bank has finished its second com-
plete half-year since No. 2 reconstruction (the one at
which deposit-interest was reduced from 4J to 3 per cent.)
with a profit of £3746, as compared with £1725 for the
previous half. This is equal to 12s. 3d. per cent, per
annum on the shareholders’ funds. Which is a very small
return from an institution that gets the bulk of its de-
posits at so cheap a rate. Apart from this one item about
the remarkable scarcity of profit, there is exceedingly
little information in the A. J.S. Bank’s balance-sheet now-
adays. It shows inscribed stock deposits separately, but
the reconstructed A and B deposits, the new fixed de-
posits, and new current accounts and accrued interest are
all lumped together. This comprehensive item has de-
creased by £481,000 during the half-year. It was an-
nounced six months ago that £250,000 of the reconstructed
A deposits were to be paid off, and this accounts for
part of the reduction. Also two lots of B deposits have
been redeemed by tender (amount not stated) which also
assists in the reduction. Whether the new business is
increasing or not there is nothing to show. The B de-
posits were bought up at a discount (amount of discount
uncertain), and the profits (amount unknown) were placed
to a special reserve account which doesn’t appear in the
balance-sheet, so presumably it went to write off depre-
ciation on the old assets. How much depreciation there
is to provide for is an absolutely unknown quantity. A
year ago it was explained that £95,000 of the old reserve-
fund (set aside in ’93 to cover depreciation) still remained
to meet losses on the realisation of the old assets; but
whether there is any of it left now there is nothing to
show.
The writer presumes that there are still heavy-
losses to provide for—simply because, for a bank with a
large business, a comparatively small capital to earn divi-
dends upon, and a great mass of cheap deposits,
the profits of the A.J.S. are very small indeed.
Whether it will make enough by buying up its B deposits
at a discount, and out of current earnings, to cover all
losses, or whether it will be ultimately necessary to cast a
small part or a large one of the capital overboard, depends
on luck, and the revival of trade, and the amount of the
loss, and other unknown circumstances. The reserve of
cash and liquid securities (£1,204,719) is £520,000 less than
it was last half-year. And the latest quoted sales of shares
(£7 10s. paid) were at 65., so, despite the distinct improve-
ment, the public is apparently of opinion that the A.J.S.
has many troubles to overcome before it is a div.-paying
institution again. If the management would divide A
and B deposits, new fixed deposits, and new current
accounts into four separate items, and show' what profit
was made on the purchase of deposits, and where it went
to, and separate the old advances in process of liquidation
from the new ones, things would at least be a lot more
understandable.
* * * *
The balance-sheet of the Oity Bank of Sydney
for the half-year ended 30th June, ’9B, shows very little
variation. The profits are £8273, which is a trifle less
than last half-year. The following list of profits shows
the even tenor of the little Oity Bank for a good while

As usual the City Bank shows just enough profit to pay
its 4 per cent, dividend (£8000) and have a nominal
balance over. The management’s explanation of this is
practically to the effect that it only endeavors to show
enough profit to cover its dividend, the remainder
(amount of remainder unknown) being set aside to wipe
off depreciation and bad debts (amount of these also
unknown), the natural result of the recent disastrous
times. In the words of the boss director, the Oity
Bank could, even under the most unfavorable cir-
cumstances, “pay all its debts and return a large
proportion of, if not all of, the paid-up capital.” This
is a perfectly reasonable explanation, the worst of
it being that it leaves the position of the Oity Bank rather
obscure. For it doesn’t show whether the gross earnings
are increasing or diminishing, what they amount to, what
sum is being set aside to cover depreciation, or how much
estimated depreciation there is to cover, and consequently
how long it will be before the writing-off process is com-
pleted. Still, there seems no reason to doubt the state-
ment that the City Bank is a perfectly safe institution so
far as its creditors are concerned. At all events, its
£1,861,000 of advances and office property would have to
depreciate to £861,000 before its capital and reserves
would be absorbed, and a margin of 36 per cent, is a
pretty large one.
The City Bank’s profit of .£8273 equals £3 6s.
2d. per cent, per annum on capital, and the small balance
of £273, added to previous accumulations, leaves £8976
at credit of profit and loss. The cash (t 285,997) is equal
to 25 per cent, on all liabilities to the public. Compared
with previous half-year the deposits have decreased about
£27,000 ; note circulation, about £4000; and cash, about
£6500. One notable feature is, that whatever the City
Bank may be doing in the way of providing for deprecia-
tion, it never seems to allow anything for the depreciation
in its furniture or the possible fall in the value of its office
property, this item having stood at exactly the same
figure (£138,843 Is.) for six consecutive half-years. Also,
the City Bank seems to have absolutely no reserve of
State or other securities. And the last quoted sales of its
old shares (£8 paid up) were £3 10s., while the latest
quoted sales of its new shares (also £8 paid up) were at
£3 2s. 6d., so, for some reason or other, the public per-
sists in holding a rather low opinion of this institution.
And though the shares, at present prices, yield the very
excellent return of over 9 per cent, to the holder, the
people “in the know” apparently don’t rush m and
buy with sufficient vigor to make any notable rise. Still,
that may imply that their money is otherwise employed,
or that they lack the necessary enterprise, or that they
aren’t rushing after large profits just now.

The Royal Bank of Queensland comes out
reasonably well with a profit, for the half-year just closed,
of £7460. * This compares with some previous profits as
follows : _
June, 1895 .. .. £5946 June, 1897 .. .. £7463
December, 1895 .. 6033 December, 1897 .. 7440
June, 1896.. .. 6445 June, 1898.. .. 7460
December, 1896 .. 6515 |
The profit runs to about £3 10s. 6d. per cent, per annum
on the shareholders’ funds, but, in accordance with the usual
wise custom, the div. is kept down to 2J per cent., which,
with div.-duty, absorbs £5075. Another £2OOO is added
to reserve fund, making it £39,000, and there is a balance
of £385 to carry forward. That lamentable streak of ill-
luck known as the “ Oliver cheque case ” involves a loss
of £3OOO, so that the balance at credit of profit and loss is
now only £lO7O. In a general way things look well with
the Royal of Queensland. Deposits have increased during
the half-year by £lO,OOO. The cash and liquid securities
are £255',570, equivalent to over 32 per cent, on all liabili-
ties to the public. By rigidly keeping down the dividend
to 2i per cent., a very respectable reserve is being built
up, and the fact that it is separately invested in State
securities is a sufficient guarantee that it is a reserve
which can be found when wanted. The Royal has such a
large capital in proportion to its business that its securi-
ties would need to depreciate fully 46 per cent, (very
nearly one-half) before the margin of safety afforded to
its depositors by the shareholders’ money would disap-
pear. Only three other banks in Australasia show so
large a margin of security for their depositors.

Broken Hill Water Supply co. made a profit of
£11,779 last half-year, equal to about 12J per cent, per
annum on capital. The following list of profits shows
how this healthy monopoly has been feeling in recent
JunV 1894 .. £7,844 December, 1896.. £10,077
December, 1894.. 5,076 June, 1897 .. 13,365
June, 1895 .. 4,882 December, 1897.. 15,705
December, 1895.. 12,901 June, 1898 .. 11,7/9
June, 1896 .. 6,686 _ .
The co. pays a 10 per cent, dividend (19325), carries
£2500 to contingency reserve, making it £5OOO, and has a
balance of £18,521 still left at credit of profit and loss.
This means that the total accumulations and reserves of
all kinds equal £23,521. Oil the other side of the account
there are certain assets that will badly want writing-off
some day. “ Water-rights, leases, Parliamentary Bills,
&c.,” are set down as worth £25,194, and as the rights
and leases will ultimately expire, and the old Act of Par-
liament isn’t saleable, all these will presumably have to be
written-off. So far, nothing seems to have been done in this
direction, and these items stand at the same figure year
after year. Also, £156,689 worth of plant is still set down
at cost despite a number of years’wear and tear, yet it
seems reasonable to suppose that there is considerable
depreciation, unless the co. holds that the corroding
fino-er of Time doesn’t exist on the Barrier. A tendency
to keep up the apparent profits and the paper reserves by
saying as little as possible on the painful subject of
depreciation seems a characteristic of the Broken Hill
Water co,
* * * *
B.H. Prop. co. in its half-year to May 31 made
a profit of £139,865 after writing off £37,702 for deprecia-
tion ; and £144,000 was distributed in divs. The depre-
ciation allowance does not reach the sum spent on new
works, which totalled £52,100. The co. does not, how-
ever, charge such expenditure against the half-year in
which it was made, but charges against each half-year
the amount by which it is estimated the whole works have
depreciated. Liquid assets are estimated at £512,863 in
excess of liabilities ; the reserve-fund (now £125,000) and
bank balances (£66,950) are, in fact, in excess of total
liabilities, leaving bullion and refinery products (£329,000)
and stores, &c., to the good. The reserve is invested, but
the investments are not specified.

The B.H. Prop, co.’s output of silver last half-
year was 2,873,6840 z. fine, against 3,248,5860 z. in the pre-
ceding half-vear. But the lead output was 15,803 tons,
•or 4886 tons more ; gold, 8130 oz. (but this included pur-
chased Westralian ore ; the practice of including this
latter product seems questionable) ; and copper 224
tons, or 22 tons more. As to prices, silver fluctuated be-
tween 2s. 3fd. and 2s. Id. per oz. standard, as against 2s.
'6d, and Is. Ilfd. in the preceding half; but this last half-
year’s average was id. per oz. less, and so put up (or down)
a record. Here is the highest quotation for each year since
and including ’B5, when thc co. began P (^d ' (fj's. silver-

worth of gold has been got out of the mine since last Dec.
Nearly 250 z. a week ! Great Scott 1 t
Cobar-Chesney. Manager’s last report i ndi cates
a great improvement in this mine in the workings from
the 360 level. The north drive, the ore in which has Jong
been somewhat broken, is now nearing the run of oxidisea
ore worked nearer the surface, and is getting into ™lphi e
nnnnpr-ove of good grade. The drive south has been so
foTTn hb>h gmde sulphide as to establish the. existence
of an ore body never before worked, while its size is indi-
cated by the fact that the crosscut has gone 15ft. west of
the drive without reaching the walls.

Mt Apsley Copper, N.S.W. This crowd has
spent over £lOOO in getting at the bottom of the old mine
which had. its smelters going many years back. J he
was struck recently, 30ft. from the new shaft, sft. wide.
The first foot was found to be solid rich
over 12 per cent, copper, the balance a crushed slate
carrying copper and iron sulphides with some zinc, an
on the last wall a 9in. seam of pug They mean to sink
on and drive upon the lode to see if it will improve.

New Mt. Hope Copper co. is being worked on
tribute at such a profit as to enable a small half-yearly
div. to be paid. With a railway this might be; made a big
district. Apart from it, the copper and other mineral
deposits of the far West of N.S.W. are worthy of aline,
and are next to worthless without it.

Reported from the Peak Hill mine, N.S.W.,
that the rich pyrites vein recently struck at the 650 level
is now 3ft. thick, shows good free gold ; assays have gone
wonderfully high. It will take something more£han high
assays to restore confidence in any N.S.W. mine with a
disappointing past, and, from the slow wav in which the
shares move, nothing but solid cakes of retorted gold will
do it in this case. *

So far the returns from the S.A. Govt, plant at
McDonnell Ranges, Centralia, has been generally dis-
appointing. Battery treatment has given for the largest
parcels, brought long distances, about half an ounce , the
average cyanide extraction has been under 12 dwts.
South Aus. goes in for still more State opera-
tions. In Vic., it was found, ice for the refrigerating cars,
&c., is supplied at 6s. 3d. per ton ;in S.A. nearly s d. per
lb. has been charged. So S.A. State Export Dept, begins
the manufacture of ice, and promises the article for about
10s. or 11s. per ton.

When Foster, the Vic. Mines Minister, came
back from his much-advertised inspection of Mt. Deddick,

attempt to prove the alleged richness of Deddick United
is—£3 shares dropped to 2s. 6d. sellers.

got by concentration, for which it has the finest plant in
Victoria.

The Big German co., Tongio West, Vic., is
working on cheaply-acquired tailings by cyanidation
and electrolysis and making a huge success ; it has the
biggest and most complete cyanide plant south of the
line. How its “lay” with Big Reef (Mt. Hepburn) will
come out remains to be seen. Rumor credits the Big
Reef (now humming merrily again) with 6 to 7dwt. ; if so,
and a 14ft. reef, it should do.

Dry Gully, near Omeo, is looking up, and the
floating mining population that is always eager to rush
turns its attention in that direction. Dry Gully is another
of the numerous fields with a glorious legendary past.
Gippsland is full of fields that did, and possesses very few
that do. The folk-lore of this district is as romantic as
any in the world, and more prolific than most, and it deals
generally with the prodigious yields of 20 years back. The
Dry Gully legends are just now in active circulation, but
it is a locality of shreds and patches, and certainly not
worth a rush.

Queensland Menzies’ (W.A.) half-year’s gold :

The average yield of gold per ton during the
last six months from Mt. Magnet district, W. A., was a
little over lOdwt. But for a few small, rich crushmgs, it
would have been much lower. The Piedmont, a Bull-
owned mine, on which a 20-head mill was recently erected,
has cleaned up its first crushing—4oo tons, for 6dwt. 13grs.

What, again! “Splendid specimens of coarse
gold have been obtained at a spot connecting the old with
the new shaft in the General Gordon mine, W.A. It is
not known if any body of ore is available for breaking.
There was a time when no such reservations were made.
Everything found in the G. G. mine was amazingly and
permanently rich. How many tons of solid gold would it
need to create a new boom in this awful “cat”? “Why,
asks “ Inquirer,” “are bogus mines called ‘ wild cats ’ ?
Probably because they have so many lives. Wild cat as
was the G.G., should it ever strike a run of gold a hundred
iniquities would be redeemed; experts who reported would
say “ Didn’t we say so ?” and the writer would be once
more blackguarded for not knowing better.

From Hannan’s “ This camp is going along,
making improvements to machinery, etc. The lower
levels are looking well, and, from present appearances,
there must be an improvement in the shares during this

and is, apparently, waiting for a bigger production, which
will surely come."

After minutely describing a 1001 b. nugget, sup-
posed to be found by some Italians on one of the Kanowna
leads, it is now wired that the discovery is locally re-
garded as a mere fabrication. None of the banks have
received the gold, and the police have made very careful
inquiries in all the gold-field towns. Per contra is the
alleged statement of a R.C. priest that he has seen the big
nugget. A 7oz. nugget from the south lead at Kanowna
is the biggest piece of alluvial gold discovered for a very
long time.

A big battle is proceeding between North and
South Tas. re the railways to the W. Coast. The Great
Western line—which begins at the terminus of the Der-
went Valley, in the midst of a sheep district, runs through
a barren, unexplored region where neither agricultural
nor mineral land is at present known, and ends nowhere—
can absolutely touch no mining field without the sanction
of Parliament. It conies to a sudden stop about four miles
E. of Mt. Lyell. On the other side the Emu Bay line
runs clean through a mineral district, directly it leaves
the V.D.L. Co.’s grab, and finishes where it likes, tapping
Rosebery, Mt. Read, Hercules, Curtin and Davis, Cole-
brook, King River, Red Hills and hosts of other properties.
It will also proceed, with a branch line, to Mt. Lyell from
Rosebery; and it is this branch that has caused the
disturbance. Already there are faint whispers that,
should the latter co. extend to Mt. Lyell, the flotation of
the G.W. will be damned.
The slump on Tasmania’s W. Coast still continues.
Several mines have closed down, allegedly waiting for the
advent of the Emu Bay line. Rosebery shares are silent,
Colebrooks are very sick, and the Doras are dead, buried
and forgotten. The boom of a few months back has left a
black smudge that will need a lot of wiping off, and when
the next one happens the scripping public—will hold oft i
Not much. Once bitten twice shy doesn’t apply fiere.
A W. Coast surveyor is reported to have made ,140,000 in

Dear Bulletin. — Your man from Chillagoe,
who, “so far, has shown that he knows his business,
gays _“ At £20,000 I reckon the Chillagoe scheme was a
fair enough venture, but at two millions it is not. Of
course, it will take from half to three-quarters of a
million to build the railway and the balance of the million
to equip the mines.” Firstly, the capital is not £2,000,000,
but £l,Boo,ooo—a little discrepancy of £2oo,ooo—ten times
the amount which would make the “ Chillagoe scheme
a fair enough venture ” —evidently doesn’t matter. And,
as it is admitted that the mines are valueless without
a railway, and the railway will, of coarse, “take
from half to three-quarters of a million to build, the
£20,000 capitalisation would make the Chillagoe
scheme, not “ a fair enough venture,” but a fruitless,
unnecessary swindle. As the engineers say the
line can be built for £400,000, why will the railway of
course cost, vaguely, half to a quarter of a million ? And
why will a quarter of a million be necessary to open up
the mines when men—the kings of the business in Aus-
tralia—say that £lOO,OOO will be sufficient ? And if your
man, who “ so far has shown that he knows his business, ’
throws half-millions and quarter-millions about in this
reckless way, and wilfully puts a non-existent £200,000 on
to the capitalisation, why should he object to a capitalisa-
tion which is, on his own showing, indispensable ? . . ,
Later on in the paragraph he talks of the pipeyness of the
ore bodies near the Queenslander, which is so much con-
sidered as one of the side-shows of the proprietary’s mines
that it is never mentioned. But he leaves the Griffith
and the Girofla, and the P.P.A. No. 2, and the Harper and
others severely alone; and, if his knowledge of ore-de-
posits is as vague as his figures, he is wise in so doing,—
Randolph Bedford.

Ed. Bulletin. —“Copper-Headed Juggins,” in
Bulletin of July 9, takes great pains to prove his right
to the last third of his name. No geologist has attempted
“ to certify to the possible ‘richness’ of the Chillagoe
field ” without fixing “ a minimum value for the ore afore-
said,” because it isn’t a geologist’s business to deal with
metal markets, and his basis of “richness” is the per-
centage of metal in the ore. Also, copper has never ex-
perienced the awful and sudden fall silver has since
Broken Hill started to open, yet Broken Hill continues to
produce at a profit in the face of the sulphide difficulties,
which would have knocked the bottom out of the Barrier
had they (the difficulties) been discovered before interests
had become so vested that an acknowledgment of failure
was impossible. And, fifteenthly, and in conclusion, the
future of the copper-market never looked so bright as
now. The supplies for ’97 were 23,000 tons over those of
’96, yet the stocks on hand at the close of ’97 were lower
by 5000 tons than the over-stocks of the preceding year.
“ Copper-Headed Juggins” is talking through his hat.—
Yours, Mainshaft.

In some Brisbane squatting rent-appeal cases
valuation experts have been deposing that the Q. pastoral
industry is going to pot. A- C. Grant, managing member
of B. D. Morehead and Co., deposed that £l4 a head was
not a high price for fat cattle in Melbourne ; as high as
£l6 had been given. Queensland cattle, driven to Mel-
bourne and reaching there in good condition, might,
under exceptional circumstances, realise £lO a head. The
store cattle sold by witness’s firm at Esk (Q.) in '96
averaged £2 4s. a head. In ’97 they realised from 345. to
355. This year, people were so frightened of the ticks
that he doubted whether they could be sold at all. Bar-
rister Lilley : “ Do you think there is going to be an end
of the pastoral industry in Queensland ? ” “It looks very
like it—to the present owners.” “ You take a very
gloomy view of it, then?” “I don’t think so.
I wish to take a fair view of it.” Mr. Grant
told how he had recently sold Pomerania Downs,
a station in the Burke district, through which the ticks
had been, leaving the cattle immune, for 10s. per head,
including the station and everything connected with ft-
(To his Honor) : “ Ten years ago he would say that station
would have easily brought £3 10s. per head.” The tale of
woe of Frank Alex. Powell, now a N.S.W. grazier,,ex-
partner in Thargomindah station (Q.), was that he bought
into Thargo. at £7 per head for 19,000 cattle, left it after
15 years with 57,000 head of cattle and without having
increased the debt. He went out with just as much
money as he had put in, thus investing capital for 15
years and getting no interest on it. In ’BB cattle-stations
could be sold for £4 a head. In ’9l he sold out for £2 a
head and bought into another station for £2 a head.

Curious alleged dummying case, from Croydon.
Royal Bank closed down on Mark Twain mine for a
£l3OO overdraft two years ago. Since then have only
spent money in applications for exemption and forfeiture.
Mine held for two years without a day’s bona fide mining
work being done ; consequently, mine much dilapidated.
Then came along a miner who applied for forfeiture.
Dummying and shepherding admitted. Bank offers
jumper a tribute in mine, and at latest advices Warden
Towner had expressed himself that the offer was fair, and
that the bank’s right to keep on dummying should be
validated by their offer, not to work the mine, but to let
somebody else work it for the bank —at his own expens,e.

Woman’s “ bargain’’-rapacity will never
receive stronger illustration than in the fact that,
at a recent Australian metropolitan display-
clearing-sale, the disgraceful hustling and scramb-
ling after “goods absolutely below cost,” and so
forth, resulted in unexpected increase of the
population by two. One interesting event took
place while the mother was being fitted with
boots, and the other little stranger materialised
in the mantle-department. If there’s anything in
the pre-natal influence notion, it oughtn’t to be
surprising to find a thus-supervening infant
marked “This style, 3s. lid.,” or “Quite the
latest,” or “ Positively must be got rid of ! ”

“Yah! Yah!” for the stoker who puts off his
offensive dungaree for “ an irreproachable evening
suit.” Practically the best Gov. Brassey can say

evening suit and warbles “The Lost Chord.”

F. C. Hodel, of Thursday Island, tells
how a Jap of his acquaintance wanted to buy a
boat, but failed because he hadn’t enough cash to
pay the deposit. Took a job, saved his wages,
and bought timber. Every night he toiled away
by moonlight, starlight, and lamplight until a
boat was completed. Then a swarm of Japs came
down and launched the sampan. A big mesh net
was manufactured, and the Japs, in three months,
secured the fresh-fish trade of Thursday, and the
Chinese, who had previously run the business, de-
parted. It is no uncommon thing in the North
for a Jap to offer his services gratis for 12 months
on condition he be taught reading and writing.

Adelaide Hospital recently received a
legacy of ,£lOO,OOO under the will of Thomas Mar-
tin, a former Adelaide merchant. A peculiar
aspect of the matter is the fact, that among the
trustees appointed are one or two men who have
been bitterly antagonistic to the new regime, but
trusteeship carries a legacy of £lOOO, and they
therefore decided to accept the position. An
attempt is being made, by the way, to found a
“ People’s Hospital, ’’ under the control of the
striking doctors who are still out in the cold.

The absurdity of the claim of the outside
doctors and their friends to a commanding voice
in the management of Adelaide Hospital is shown
by the figures as to revenue. In 1897-8 private
contributions totalled £037, and patients’ fees
£421; the Government subsidy was £10,445.
Even in the days when the medical association
belt! sway the private contributions did not exceed
£lOOO. Kingston is especially gleeful because the
will of Mr. Martin, under which the institution
gets over £lOO,OOO, was drawn up after the late
hon. medical staff had struck work and cleared

“Avisford”: The literary public (in the
capacity of Judge) “is a hass.” A few years ago
a Maoriland paper, working the cheap" “copy”
dodge of offering prizes for Xmas tales, selected
“ the 20 best sent in,” and allowed its readers to
allot the prizes by vote. One of the three prize-
tales had for its substance the woes of an out-of-
work bank-clerk afflicted with a dying child.
The agony was strung out to the necessary
3c015., and then the bank directorate
somehow reinstated the clerk, and
the incurable heart-complaint
of the child, which the
doctors had diagnosed,
proved to be non-exist-
ent. Gladys parted

“ An interesting case shortly comes before the courts.
The story goes that some time before his death the late
Mr. Abingdon Baird purchased from a Bond-street shop a
quantity of jewellery valued at £15,000, which he in-
tended 'to present to Mrs. Langtry. During one of his
temporary aberrations, however, he gave this costly pre-
sent- to Lady Aylesbury (n6e Dolly Tester). Later on he
desired to regain possession of the jewels in order to hand
them, as he had originally intended, to Mrs. Langtry,
and entrusted the task to his friend, Mr. Bayly, pro-
mising that worthy £lOOO should he be successful. The
trustees of Mr. Baird’s estate now contest Mr. Bayly’s
claim to the reward. All the living principals concerned
have been summoned as witnesses.” —London Paper.
“6Y.H.”: When Fitzgerald’s circus visited the “ far
north,” some weeks ago, a black-boy was taken to see the
show. Of course, it was a marvel to him ; he liked the
way Lizzie, the elephant, drank the beer at the pubs., but
told the boss afterwards that the girl who “ went up
high pfeller longa rope was ‘ boongira ’ (no good). What
for she no wear ’em trouser ! ” Don’t you think it was
very wrong to try and corrupt the poor nig.’s morals in
this way ?

“ M‘G.” : Saw “ Hamlet” for the first time with Wil-
son Barrett’s co., and decline to believe that any intelli-
gent person, unaffected by Shakespeare-worship or un-
awed by opinions of authorities, can regard it as any-
thing but a jumble of dialogue beginning in obscurity
and ending nowhere. Having read the play perhaps a
dozen times, also Lamb’s “ Tales from Shakespeare,” 1
was able to follow the story, what thete is of it, but I’ll
defy an) r body who is ignorant of the motive to come
away from the play and tell what it is all about. Isn t it
about time somebody started to dethrone the Bard of
Avon as a playwright ? As an author his writings are
masterpieces ; but with long-winded speeches, objectless
dialogue, multiplicity of scenes, execrable stage arrange-
ment and weak “ curtains” —the author’s obvious ignor-
ance of stage-craft is to me the strongest argument in
favor of the Baconian theory.
A certain capricious little stage lady was disposed to
raise Cain when she found she was to play principal girl
to the “ hoy” of a .youthful rival. Vowing that nothing
would induce her to go on, she deluged her manager with
wires to that effect. The manager replied that it was for
her to decide, but that if she declined to go on her en-
gagement would go off. The lady calmed down.
A N.S.W. bushy went to a circus, way back, t’other
day, and took a ss. seat. After the show he prospecled
for the business manager, with “ Say, mister, bv accident
I gave your ticket-seller five sovs. instead of five bob.
Any chance of getting it back?” Manager didn’t think
there was, but would see. Strange to say, there was an
unexplained surplus in the till of £3lss. and a Manx coin.
So the b.m. next mornin ; asked the loser : “ Did you ever
own an Isle of Man coin?” “By cripes! yes. My lucky
coin, too; and” (fumbling in his pocket) “blessed if it
hasn’t gone 1” The bona fides being proved, the b.m., on
the qui vise for advt., replied—“ Well, old man, instead
of tsyou paid £4 and that coin. If you’ll come to the
show to-night, the boss will call from the ring- ‘ Last
evening someone paid four sovereigns and a Manx coin
in lieu of five shillings. If the owner is in the audi nee
will he kindly step this way, and the money, less 55., will
be returned him.’ Then you jump into the ring, get
your coin with a few words of thanks for our honesty,
and there you are.” Of course the loser caught right on,
but he was rather shocked that night to hear the circus
boss yell :—“ Last evening someone paid four sovereigns
and a magsman’s coin,” etc. But he stepped forward all
the same. Even now the circus boss has not “ tumbled ”
to his “bloomer.”
Arqus, in recent theatrical criticism :—*• suss Fanny
Liddiard knows how to make a capital use of her attrac-
tive voice, and she got good value out of the music, but
when the footlights were extinguished, and she essayed a
‘ pas seul ’ under the limelight, the inadequacy of her
equipment became painfully noticeable.” Which pos-
sibly accounted for the big muster of bald-heads in the
stalls next night.
How provincial the mind that complains of Ugo Biondi’s
imitations being “absolutely lost to Australian audi-
ences”! For which matter, the majority of them were
absolutely lost to audiences in London, where Biondi
made his biggest success. As for the suggestion that he
should give a portrait of Marshall Hall, it is absurd, even
from a Melb, provincial point of view. Not 10 per cent,
of an average Opera House audience has ever seen Mar-
shall Hall conducting an orchestra, or would know him if
he were to come in person and give an imitation of him-
self.
“S.”: A fearful and wonderful play is “His Terrible
Task,” recently at Melb. Bijou. Here is a specimen from
the dialogue, which abounds in such sparkling jewels for
the forefinger of Time. Hon. Danton (addressing a man
stricken with paralysis): “ Bear up, my good man. I
have an old overcoat in the hall. I will throw it over
you. That will revive you.”
C.M.G.” : Had a chat with a Melb.
palmist the other day. Said he: “Itis a mistake
to think we make our money out of simpletons
who really believe in the craft, and have an un-
questioning faith in our predictions. They con-
tribute part of my income, but I do best out of
the smart people who come here to demonstrate
what a transparent fraud I am. They usually
come in parties, a pair of couples for choice,
and they admit the truth of everything I
say, and have a real good time at their
own expense. I charge this sort
double rates, cash in advance,
and tell them just anything
that will gratify their whim.
This game is wonderfully
popular with young
people from the coun-
try. They think me
a rogue, T know
they are fools,
and—well, they
are not paid for
it and I am.”

“ Cos.” to The Bulletin :
Re “ R.F.’s” “Polygamy v. King-street.” From the
woman’s point of view, part of a good home is
better than no home at all. The whole difficulty
seems based on the widespread fallacy that Woman is a
cold-blooded animal, or gifted with superhuman powers
of restraint, and when she turns out to be just as much
alive as Man she is denounced as criminal. For the
female, society ukases “ marriage, celibacy or crime ; ”
for the male it is “marriage, or do as you please,” and as
marriage spells monotony, expense and responsibility,
manv males prefer the easy alternative. Cowardly? Not
a bit of it—far less contemptible than a bad marriage and
the production of probable paupers and weaklings.
Society unctuously pretends to believe that prostitution
is aggressive, whereas it is passive, and when women can
live on that “ good name ” which is supposed to be better
than foi l and shelter, sexual folly will become as rare as
Christianity in a church. Meanwhile it is very easy to
say, “ Go in peace and sin no more ; ” but it takes money
to buy tucker, and as the increase of poverty tends to
the increase of free women, the wealth-owners should
do their duty by marrying enough women to pre-
vent the necessity of the so-called evil, leaving the poorer
men to patronise the small percentage of wilful prosti-
tutes. Failing polygamy, there should be a State
foundling-home or—l suppose you wouldn’t print the
alternative. It is the baby which forces the victim to
become the offender. For once, the Law is ahead of the
people Society has no First Offenders’ Act.

Any suggestion that old Crotty’s bequest might be

“ Carlo ” : The flying gang which at

whereas it often happens that a regular pas-
senger so well-known at his home-station
as to pass the barrier without ticket-in
spection, finds he has left his pass in his
other vest. Taking the name and ad-
dress in the carriage would suffice,
without thus putting the man in
the pillory. [But, then, in nine
cases out of ten he gives some-
body else’s name and address in
the carriage. And in about as
many cases he is doing a swin-

fession. I recommended the purchase
of a book, a cavity cut in the centre,
and ordinary book - postage. He
then asked me if I (I was in
Uncle Sam's employ) would post it,
which I did. What special robbery
supplied the contents I do not
know. Didn’t even read the address,
but the burg, never allowed me again
to pay (25 cents) for Sazerac brandy.

he was about the length of the court from the
place of conflict—said court being nearly 40ft. long.
Deposed further that he thought there were about
100 people present during the row, or about as
many as he could see in the court. The court at

Maoriland Primate Cowie's recent whoop
about the local prospects of the Anglican Church,
has evoked from a candid and courageous local
parson the following ruthlessly plain speaking:—
If this is a correct report, the optimism of bishops is
even more invincible than the optimism of mine managers.
We are all familiar with the statement —“ splendid pros-
pects,” “ never saw the reef looking better” —we are also
aware, some of us to our cost, that this hopeful language
is not always the precursor of dividends. . . . The Church
is not influencing the public character, we are not purify-
ing and elevating family, social, commercial, political
life. Some of our best citizens won’t go to church, some
of our worst are in places of honor and trust in the
Church. The bulk of people have ceased to take us
clergy seriously. They think, and some of them are
frank enough to say, that we have a part to repeat, and
are comfortably housed and well paid for doing it, but
we believe no more than they do, only we make moie
pretence. . . . The moral tone of the Church is low. The
same maxims, principles, and habits which degrade
political and commercial life, pass current in our synods,
our committees, our boards —favoritism, craft, flattery of
the strong, bullying of the weak, hollow mutual lauda-
tion, reckless expenditure, foolish stinginess, perversion
of trusts—in the face of all this, we are asked to be
hopeful!
Well, The Bulletin can’t help thinking there’s
hope for any Church that hasn’t succeeded in
eating away the moral fibre of such a Daniel come
to judgment as this. Good old parson !

“A well-known Society lady was staying
at Ascot during race-week a couple of years ago.
The lady was unusually stout. On the first morn-
ing of her visit a hip-bath was provided for her
use, but when she sat down therein all the water
overflowed, and a vacuum was created between
the lady and the bath. Unable to extricate her-
self, the lady, carrying the bath on her back, snail-
wise, crawled to the bell and summoned assist-
ance. The combined efforts of several maids,
some pulling at the bath and some at the lady,
failed to separate the two, and, as a last resource,
the village blacksmith was called in. That mighty
man, with large and sinewy hands, bored a hole
in the bath, and thus destroyed the vacuum. This
Q.E.D.
“The stout gentleman looks very sober.”
“ Yes ; I heard him tell a friend that there
was nothing fit to drink in the
house!”
being accomplished, the bath fell off, and the lady
was free once more. She now abhors a vacuum.”

For when I played the Ghost he said
I was the best he’d ever had.

Ah, well! from praising self I shrink,
But wait, sir, till you’ve witnessed mine !
So, I’m the man you want to see—
For “lead” or “heavies”? Do I dream ?
What, sir-r-r ! you dare to offer me
A policeman in a racing-scene !
Don’t go ! I’ll take it—mine’s a beer—
Not many offers come my way ;

The mealy-mouthers of to-day.
You often wonder where I sleep,
And how obtain my pittance small ;
My wife a boarding-house doth keep,
And she supplies the wherewithal.
Her conduct oft doth cause me pain,
It tears my pride out by its roots ;
But now, in harness once again,
I’ll black no more the boarders’ boots.

All Drapers Everywhere.
Are You Careless?
Some people are careless in everything, others in
a few things which they consider of minor import-
ance. A great many people are careless of their
health, although they do not consider that they
are so at the time. Nearly everyone suffers at
some time or other from constipation. A distress-
ing ailment, which is caused in most cases by
carelessness and neglect, but it is sometimes
brought about by a disordered condition of the
liver. It is an irregular and weak action of the
bowels, and in extreme cases the bowels may not
act for weeks. In a case of this sort the complaint
is very dangerous, and a proper remedy should be
applied immediately. Women suffer more from
it than men, and the frequent headaches suffered
by this sex can nearly always trace their origin to
constipation. Bile Beans for Biliousness are the
very best cure obtainable for constipation. It is,
however, a fact that where regularity of habit is
practised constipation is seldom found. The
effects of constipation on the system are many and
varied, among the most common of which may be
mentioned piles, sick headaches, debility, sour
stomach, humours, and intermittent fevers. Regu-
larity is the main thing to be observed in cases of
constipation, and, in conjunction with a short
course of Bile Beans, will prove very effective in
all cases of constipation, whether caused by care-
lessness or not.*

A WOMAN’S LETTER.
Sydney, August 2, 1898.
My Dkab Myee—
Last week owed all its social illumination to
one great, glittering scorch, the Freemasons’
ball. In branding it a ball, I merely imitate
the description on the ticket, but, taken to pieces,
the party decomposed into, first—an abnormal
crush, beginning about sunset; second, organ
recital by Mr. Gehde; third, organ recital by
Mr. Massey; fourth, march of pinafores under
arched swords ; fifth and sixth, bibs and tuckers
ditto; by way of conclusion, the arrival of dis-
tinguished guests, and the tremors of various
tou'peed ladies marching under those pointed
swords; finally, Gorsave, and the indescribably
fetching sound of thousands of patriots rising: in
their creaking boots; lastly, hundreds of white,
and other shades of white, kid hands making wild
Masonic passes in the air. Then, the Ball.
After all that, I find that I’ve still forgotten a
feature. At the doorway lady guests were gener-
ously, if a little tactlessly, presented with bottles
of moss rose, jockey club, wood-violet, and other
decayed vegetable odors. A loud uncorking
began in the cloak-room, followed shortly by the
bristling battle of a hundred hostile fragrances.
This odorous feud endured as long as the ball
lasted ; but I’ve reason to believe that “Jockey
Club ” won by a length. It lingered longest in
the hall next day.
Government House sent His Ex. back to us
once more, but reserved Lady Hampden for a less
tumultous scene. The Mayoress was also missing.
By the way, rumor isn’t nearly finished with that
little misunderstanding’s market-value. It is
trying now to get its tail round a feminine motif
for the discord, and is making some fiery varia-
tions out of Lady Hampden’s presence at the
theatre on the night of the Mayor’s ball.
■ The frocking of the evening was not confined to
any particular period. The year One was allowed
to exhibit, and there were even attempts to repre-
sent the clothes of Chaos, which was before
B.C. 1. One pink cashmere went into red-
velvet hysterics because the steel passemen-
terie on its bodice was bordered with white
fur, and because bunches of white roses and
black feathers would intensify its sad case with a
suggestion of mourning. Another pretended, it
was not pink cashmere at all, and hid behind in-
numerable rows of moss-green ribbon and grey
gimp, while the bodice kept up the pretence under
pearl-trimmings and bunches of holly. Not far
enough away was a skirt of sour-apple-green
satin, on which wild jet butterflies chased pink
and blue true-lovers’ knots. A white sash tried
to keep off this creation from a ruby-satin blouse,
brightened with pink roses, silver gimp, yellow
lace, and a pale-blue muslin fichu. Forget-
me-nots and black velvet in the hair com-
pleted the scheme. In less - artful gown
ing. Mrs. Dick Teece’s dove - grey silk was
sealed with orange velvet ; Miss Darley
deserted white and blue for a new yellow chiffon,
and comely Mrs. G. H. Reid in black and diamonds
snared the largest amount of public attention.
Georgie brought along a jubilant smile in strong
contrast to Mrs. Georgie’s well-disguised elation.
- Midway in the ball the happy pair were isolated,
while the flashlight fiend took his usual revenge
upon celebrities.
Edmund Barton’s adoring relatives deeply re-
gret that he should leave the sheltered and far
more lucrative legal profession to embark on the
' stormy and thankless sea of politics. But the
“lazy man” persists in laboring on for his
country, and is loyally and enthusiastically backed
■ up in his perseverance by his devoted wife.
“Money is not everything,” they both declare.
The Ladies’ Club made a raid against all its
cherished traditions last week, and arranged a
lively afternoon, when a comedietta was played
by a feminine cast of three. This unexpected
raid is to be carried even further into the enemy’s
country, and a lecture on Carlyle initiates a period
of intellectual renaissance that may result in—
Heaven only knows what. Possibly in essays by
the club on Freewill, the Growth of the Mind, the
Snob in Australia, Clubbery without Chummery,
and other seemly Salon subjects. The whisper of
a new Salon to include nothing of the Society type
may be inciting the Ladies’ Club to these efforts.
That fiery old Tory, Mrs. E. Lynn Linton,
must have received many shocks before her death
so far on in this flighty nineteenth century—she
perished a few weeks back. It was somewhere in the
sixties that she broke out into her famous fusilade
against the giddy Girl of the Period and the
Shrieking Sisterhood. In the light of the
pre-ent day her aspersions on the fair, frail
sex assume a mildly innocuous aspect, paint,
powder and too much crinoline being
the blackest of the crimes charged against
the ladies who flouted through the sixties. To
live through the eighties and the nineties, and to
' see her naughty sisters striking out in a hundred
new and naughtier places, to see the New Woman
■ hoisting with one claw a literature devoted to the
study of her own naughty newness, and tearing
: down the good old Tory husband system with the
other, must have given Mrs. Linton some horrible
. pangs. For the sake of my native land, I hope
she did not hear of that Westralian wife whose
husband sued her for three years’ desertion last
month, and got her sent to gaol.
Moss is beginning to flourish over the works of
■ another lady novelist—the once widely-popular
1 Rhoda Broughton. School-girls still smuggle her
under the'•boarding-school mattress, and mingle
chocolate-creams and heartaches over Joan, Nancy
and Belinda, but the moss grows, despite the
chocolates and the faithful sniffs. Ten years ago,
the snappy shrewishness of her heroines was quite
an original idea, but—well, I suppose we’ve got
beyond mere shrewishness. Anyway, “Sweet
Nancy,” which is Nancy all over again, takes a big
crowd of advancing matrons, now up to Meredith
and the Eclectic, back to the days when Rhoda
Broughton was the only magician who could reveal
life in its true fire and beauty. Every woman
ought to see “ Sweet Nancy,” if only to grasp the
meaning of that common novel sentence, “ ten
years then passed away.” Eor it isn’t the same
thing now.
The play is one large disillusion, begotten chiefly
of Pattie Browne’s Nancy. Her guileless pinafore
and pink frock don’t work somehow, and a light-
haired Pattie is not an artistic satisfaction.
Specially when the hair is dressed with such
elaboration that her head expands beyond all
proportion to her body. A simple coiffure would
do a lot for Pattie, but a mass of golden hair,
rolled and frizzled, and erected after some peculiar
architectural design of her own, spoils the sym-
metry of neck and shoulders, even of arms and
legs. The trailing blue silk tea-gown lengthened
her, and put the head into better proportion. Her
other best frock was a well-built navy foulard,
smartened with touches of vernal green. Eloise
Juno dressed the down-trodden mother in a
correctly archaic gown of black, bygone material,
fashioned with a sort of sombre humor. Pretty
Miss Lindahl, as the grass widow, struck
her most captivating coup in a peculiar
pelisse of terra - cotta cloth, trimmed with
white fur. May Browne’s clever little sketch of
Tow-tow is just the sort of 15-year-old miss you
wouldn’t invite for the Xmas holidays. I don’t
know that I should invite Bobbie or the Brat
either, two more telling characterisations by
Athena Claudius and the miniature Sydney Ford.
The much-heralded blueness of “ A Bit of Old
Chelsea ” didn’t quite arrive at this wicked city’s
expectations. Coming out of the theatre every-
one was remarking—“ls that all?” And, I
am bound to say that the emotion in their
voices was disappointment. But still —and we
shouldn’t expect too much from the author
of “Little Lord Fauntleroy” children’s books
mean gilded bread, and the authoress in ques-
tion had probably to remember her reputa-
tion as the leading Ensrlish children’s writer.
Pattie, as a Cockney girl, was a more realistic bit
of womanhood than Nancy, and the dark hair
improved things wonderfully. At the same time,
Cecil Ward’s exclamations at her grace, her loveli-
ness, her general fascinations, might have been
just a little toned down. One night, as she lay in
front of the fire, and he cried, “ Heavens, what a
lovely pose 1 ” the fire went blank out, and refused
to burn any more that evening. Of course there
may have been no connection between the two
things, but it looked as if the fire “ wasn’t taking
any.”
Lemmone’s new concert series at popular prices
resulted in an increase of audience on Saturday,
although the programme was nowhere lowered to
match the prices, and Alva gave a thrilling exhibi-
tion of her declamatory genius in the mad scene
from Mephistophele. A fascinating personality,
this dark, delicate Alva, one of the few dramatic
singers whose face follows every grade of her song’s
meaning. Remembering Albani’s cruel facial con-
tortions in her most alluring efforts, we ought to
gaze long at Alva and be glad. Evidently nervous
and panting when she first comes before you, as
soon as she begins to sing she takes pyschic flight
into her singing, and is lost to everything
else. The new soprano, Miss Marion Perrot,
is a pretty, petite lady with a sweet little voice
that wouldn’t knock anybody over. Possibly
she shrivels a little under the fire of Alva’s grand
manner. On Saturday the platform ladies all wore
previous frocks—Alva, her happy red and gold
brocade; Adela Verne, her simple white; and
sister Alice, an unbeautiful garment of dun-
colored cloth.
The Misses Verne are guests of the popular
Sydney Moss, our own pianist and teacher, who
seems to keep a vernal spot in his heart for gifted
young visiting artists. Mark and Jakoff Ham-
bourg were received straightway into the bosom
of his family, and continually trailed round the
city at his coat-tails; and now Alice and Adela
are being enthused over with a generosity not too
usual between an old pianist and a new one.
Talking of eccentric females, one day lately a
woman got into a country train at midnight on
her way to Sydney. The train had barely started
when a loud cry broke from her corner. Everyone
sat up in a hurry. Then she explained, with a
frightened gasp, that there was a parcel on lire at
her feet, and she wanted the guard called, and the
train stopped. When the rest of the carriage got
over its chokes, and explained that the parcel was
a foot-warmer, she still shivered and sobbed, and
wasn’t in the least pacified. Next station she got
out, and changed into a carriage free from horrors.
This, two years from the end of the twentieth cen-
tury 1
The national bucolic has many funny little ways.
In a certain backblock town two lovers, divided by
parents’ cruelty, used the local School of Arts as a
post-office, and hid their missives in a back num-
ber of the Gas Engineer’s Magazine— the local
lighting of kerosene and candle put this journal
out of use in the library. But one day there came
along a nasty city man who wanted nothing but
this particular mag. “ Can’t write any more to-
day, love, my chilblains are so bad good bye love,”
fell out of the front leaves. Then the middle of
the journal parted to disclose, “ My new boots are
giving my corns fitz so I wont meet you till to-
night at seven darling.” Then the nasty man
took two little bits of paper and scribbled on one,
“Chilblains—raw onions and rum three times a
day, and give up smoking.” And on the other,
“ Corns can only be cured by giving up tight
boots.” He put these cruelties into the leaves of
the journal and left. Two more blighted lives !
Writes my Melbourne correspondent:—
“ With its nose tip-tilted skywards, and emitting
sniffs of scorn, Melb. society has received the news
that Gov. Brassey has chosen a mere militiaman
to be one of his new aides. Lieutenant Frewen
‘ of the Leicestershire 3rd Battalion Regiment ’ is
the person in question. The third and fourth
battalions of the English line regiments are the
militia battalions. Mr. Frewe;n is the son of the
bimetallic Moreton Frewen, who was stumping
on behalf of free silver in Australia, a couple of
years ago. His mother is a sister of Lady Ran-
dolph Churchill.
“Waxellency Madden suffers somewhat from
swollen as well as bald head. The newspapers
have been in the In bit of styling him ‘The
Acting-Governor,’ which has been the usual style
of alluding to the temporary occupant of Govt.
House. But Mr. Madden and his family dislike
the appellation. Hence the newspapers have, by
Waxellent command, been requested to style him
‘ His Excellency the Administrator of the Gov-
ernment. ’ Sounds grand !
“Two brides of this month intend striking a
tentative blow at the orthodox bridal bouquet.
Miss Sylvia Madden has decided to carry an ivory
prayer-book up the aisle instead, and the fashion
will be inaugurated a week earlier by Miss Mabel
Watts, whose husband-elect (Rev. A. MaeFar-
lane) will assist the Bishop to marry Miss Madden.
A prayer-book will look pure and devout, perhaps,
but it cannot be so gay as a bouquet, and suggests
a confirmation service rather than a wedding
ceremony.
“Cupid and silver spoons, what an idea ! Some
Melbourne girls, headed by one of the Clarkes, are
going to present to Miss Sylvia Madden, on the
occasion of her marriage to Lieutenant Vallange,
an -what think ye ? Silver spoons ? No! Family
Bible? No ! But—but—an illuminated address !
“Acting-Gov. Madden being a nominal R.C.
some Melb. people are surprised to hear that the
forthcoming nuptials of his daughter will be
celebrated in an Anglican Church. But his
Acting-Ex.’s Catholicism is apparently very
nominal. Years back, when he married Miss
Stephen, the Church declined to drop a blessing
on the union of one of its adherents to an out-
sider, and the bridegroom quarrelled with the
said faith on the. spot. Since the date of his
wedding—over 28 years—he has seldom entered a
R.C. Church. He spends his Sabbath mornings
in garden work —with a spade, if necessary—and
shows a disposition to drift into spiritualism.
“’Tis rumored that Baronet Clarke’s young
step-brother and the Acting-Governor’s fair
fourth daughter will announce their engagement,
highly approved of by all the authorities con-
cerned, so soon as mam’zelle concludes her ‘first
season.’
“The Homoeopathic hop in the Town Hall, the
other night, was an uneventful whirl enlivened by
Oyston’s band. ‘ The Geisha ’ is the only tune to
caper to in the lancers just now. All the late
panto, booms are the best waltzes, but ‘ Benches
in the Park ’ still holds its own. Among the
notables, the Madden girls fluttered conspicuous,
Miss Ruby giving a ‘ Queen of Night ’ effect in a
black silver-bespangled gown which left a good
deal of her visible.
“Ex-Mayor Strong’s daughter is a girl who gets
some notice nowadays. Pa’s term of office
brought her to the front and she means to stay
there. She is tall, graceful, and “ so English ” in
appearance. But this is a stodgy season, and
though balls are as plentiful here as bailiffs, there
isn’t much thrill; and festivals don’t get as much
move into them as a fat woman on her second
bike-ride.
“ Odious men are making cruel comments on
the youth and innocence of the 20 white-robed
debutantes who blushed, artificially or otherwise,
at the recent vice-regal ball. Lady M.’s weak-
ness for introducing alleged novices to the pomps
and vanities of the world threatens to bring about
a rush of ewes in lambs’ clothing at the forth-
coming marriage festival. One of this season’s
debutantes dates back—so the old dancing identi-
ties say—to the Loch days, since when she has
been ‘ out ’ in all sorts of weathers. Another had
seen some travelling service on the stage and been
connected with a small side-show in Melb., ere
the acting vice-regal hostess greeted her as an
artless thing. And yet another was cast for a
deb. part, the other week, though she had figured
on the programme at a previous fancy-dress ball.
But in this case the performer was genuinely
young and fresh, almost young enough to be a
daughter of the wisest virgin in the crowd.
“Preparations for the Shakespeare Ball, at the
Town Hall on 24th, are the theme of much fireside
discussion. Stage-manager Raynham has devised
a pageant that looks most imposing on paper. A
flourish of three trumpets is to announce the
advent of sundry Trade Guilds, followed by 36
standard bearers, each with the name of a Shakes-
pearian play inscribed upon his little flag. Then
follow some lady garland-bearers who will indulge
in a rustic dance. After the ballet comes a string of
Elizabethan luminaries, including Lord Burleigh
and his historic nod. Queen Elizabeth, at this
stage of the spectacle, arrives to take possession of
a throne, whereunto Fame introduces several
literary people, Spenser, Francis Bacon, Marlowe,
and Immortal William himself. There, was a
doubt as to whether it wouldn’t be sacrilege to
drag in the Bard, but the management has finally
decided to stage Divine William, as evidence that
he wasn’t identical with Bacon. The Maddens,
who formed a Shakespearian set at their own
fancy-dress struggle, have promised to boom the
Ball all they can, and a profit of <£soo or so for the
Distressed Actors’ Fund is more than possible.
‘ At the Princess’s lately Mrs. Maesmore Morris
made a rather poor substitute for that warm-
blooded pagan, Elliott Page, of Old Rome. Our
Melb. belle, sad to say, looked piteously thin in
classic decolletage. Her arms and upper chest
were quite pathetic, and that back of hers, a thing
of beauty in up-to-date street wear, was given
away by sharp-set shoulder-blades. Then those
rich, sorgeous colors which show up Miss Page’s
dark hair and pronounced features to perfection,
only out-dazzled the delicate tints of her substi-
tute’s fragile loveliness. Altogether the willowy
blonde, as passionate, revengeful Berenis, seemed
toouneonvineinglygentle, girlish and plaintiveever
to proclaim her unasked love, or, having done so, to
make the unappreciative lady-killer smart for his
rejection of her kind offer. The present Stephanus
is a dimpled, well-washed cherub, and in a nice
little white surplice would make an effective
chorister. Perhaps Mrs. Caleb Porter was a shade
more thrilling on the rack. Still it’s consoling to
remind yourself when the small martyr is in ear-
splitting stage throes that, after all, it’s only plump
little Miss Cubitt, you know, who used to look
such a cheeky ‘Little Buttercup ’ with the operatic
amateurs of Eastern suburbs.
“Miss Elliott Page, by the way, goes home
almost at once to see the first performance of her
very own play. Enthusiastic girls complain that
it was a shame to make poor Julius Knight pose as
that horrid Napoleon till the dear thing has
actually permanently acquired the Little Cor-
poral’s characteristic stoop. Nowadays, Marcus
sticks his head forward like Deeming at the most
critical moments, when he ought to be arranging
semi-divine attitudes —‘ the noblest Roman of
them all ’ sort of thing, don’tcherknow.
“ In real life, of course, heroes don’t always
look the part. At the Town Hall, the other even-
ing, most of the recipients of Humane Society’s
prizes were such toil-worn fellows. In fact, hero-
ism seems monopolised by the horny-handed, for
all the prize-takers earned their bread by honest
perspiration. Themate of theYaletta was theswell
of the occasion, so to speak. He wore a tail coat,,
and was singular in showing some collar at the
back, had a bald head, and looked 40 rather than
28. The knights of the sewer (you remember
how, in cold blood, they, to all intents and pur-
poses, laid down their lives for their friends) were
a very work-battered trio. One was short,,
bunchy, bearded ; another, nothing in particular
the third (and bravest) almost dour-looking. The
mate aforesaid apparently quailed most under the
glare of the public, but then he strung himself up
to make deep bows which the others didn’t. The
audience didn’t clap desperately or make half such
a fuss over them as if they’d sung a taking song.
And when speakers grew long-winded on the text
of heroism, the audience brusquely shut them up.
It was a free entertainment, you see, and when
the heroes were trotted out like a penny peep-
show people applauded condescendingly and put
nothing or a threepenny-bit in the plate towards
the prizes. The Acting-Governor, however,
atoned for popular short-comings, saying every-
thing he could think of to express his admiration
of the blushing braves.
“ Views of Spain flitter-fluttered over a cine,
sheet at Melb. Town Hall on Friday night while
Father Robinson spoke interesting patter, and
Miss Daisy Madden, and others, gave the show
a tone by singing at intervals that the reverend
throat might not be strained. Bull-fight pictures
gave a kind of Flemington-abattoir appearance to
the place, but the absence of color removed a lot
of thrill, as the scenes didn’t show up gorily at all.
A large audience listened to an apparently new
subject. Nobody reads Geo. Borrow now, or
Dick Ford’s handbook, and so the land of dons
and hidalgos is a terra incognita to all.
“ Both the Collins-street Thunderers lighted up
on N.S.W. election night and illuminated all the
rounds of the Yes-No contest, but the lookers-on
were few. The great heart of the people wasn’t
taking any throb in the matter. The perusers
were chiefly great-coated-and-umbrella’d sub-
urbanites who stopped for a moment to glance at
the returns and then pattered through the rain to
catch an early train. Victoria is thoroughly
exasperated at having to play a waiting game with
N.S.W.

GOULI-GOULI.

PERSONAL ITEMS.
. George Adams, the great sweep man, is in
his 63rd year. He has been an Australian 43 years.
There is but one English University man
in the Victorian Parliament —Murray Smith, who
is an Oxford graduate.
F. A. Wright, M.L A. for Glen Innes, is
known all over the N.S.W. Northern district as
“the old grey horse.” This is bucolic for compli-
ment.
A disastrous election is N.S.W. “general”
for the Smith-Jones-and-Brown family ! —T. R.
and Sydney Smith, R. and L. C. R. Jones, and
H. H. Brown were beaten.
“GOING INTO A DECLINE.”
Mrs. Eliza Finney, mother of Tom Finney,
M.L.A. (Q.), and of 22 other children, died on
22nd July, at her parliamentary son's residence,
Toowong (a Brisbane suburb), aged 93 years, after
40 years’ widowhood.
An old Sydney identity “went over” on
July 29 in the person of Anastasia, relict of the
late Michael Fitzpatrick, one-time Under-Secre-
tary for Lands, and, later on, Colonial Secretary
in the Farnell Ministry.
A very effective and much-used argument
against a distinguished and able candidate at the
recent N.S.W. general election (who happens to
be of a Protestant family) was that a child of his
had died in a convent. “This so-called nine-
teenth century ! ”
There is but one Smith in the new N.S. W.
Assembly ;no Jones, and one Brown. There are
two Clarks and two Clarkes, two Chapmans, and
two Davises. An O’Conor with one “n ” takes a
seat, but neither House has now a representative
of the double “ n.”
S.A. Govt, has declined to liquidate the
still-unpaid accounts of the Calvert expedition,
and, unless the public subscribes the amount, the
leader (Wells) and his men will lose about £lOOO.
Apparently there is no prospect of getting the
money from the man Calvert.
S’langdon Bonython’s bauble was con-
ferred, it is officially announced, “in recognition
of his services to the cause of public education in
South Australia.” Ye gods ! Boynthon is chair-
man of a petty School Board of Advice, a billet
which the average Jay Pee sniffs at in disdain !
H. J. Brock, owner of one-third interest
in the famous Golden Gate mine, who recently
acquired the Lawrenny estate from the trustees of
the lute Joseph Clarke, died at Hobart last week,
aged 50. He was unlucky enough to be lucky,
and, like many another good man, “ couldn’t stand
his oats.”
Paris Nesnit, Q.C., who recently caused so
much excitement in Adelaide, has now regained
his normal health and resumed practice ;
he thinks of settling in Sydney. He con-
templates publishing a book of the German
poetical translations which he made when in the
asylum.
John Dunn’s headstone in Devonshire-
street cemetery, Sydney, has been dressed with
flowers by some unknown hand on two occasions
lately. Dunn was one of the foolish youths who
followed bushranger Gardiner. He was captured
near Dubbo, and hanged at Darlinghurst in his
19th year.
Demise, W. L. G. Drew, chairman Q.
Civil Service Board and ex-Q. Auditor-General.
In ’B9 and ’9O Drew persistently drew attention to
the state of the Govt, funds in the smellful Q.N.
Bank. He hammered away so stubbornly that the
Boodlewraith found relief in shunting him into
another billet.
Popular George Reeve, of S.M. Herald,
who married a week or two before N.S.W. elec-
tions, was the man who gave Premier Reid such a
hard run for King Division in ’94. At that time
Reeve had the then less subservient Labor-party
behind him, and nearly every working pressman
in Sydney to back him up.
Melb. Royal Humane Society President
Lush has discovered a peculiar effect of the
drought, and complains that the society has been
unable to find heroes upon whom to bestow its
medals, for where there is no water people cannot
drown, and when people cannot drown nobody
has an opportunity of rescuing them. It recalls
old Coroner Youl’s: “Pooh! another devilish
dry season. Thank God it is not payment by
results with us coroners ! ”
During the course of the “Professor Haut-
mont ” trial, before Hood, J. (Vic.), barrister
Duffy, trying to prove in prisoner’s favor that cer-
tain pills were harmless, asked Dr. Shields
what effect they would have upon him (Shields).
As the doctor hummed and hawed, Duffy said,
“ Well, if you don’t like to tell us that, doctor,
tell us what effect they would have (say) upon the
jury?” Whereupon his Honor: “Most likely
cause a miscarriage of justice.”
A Parkes story : The ancient legislator had
een improving his place at Faulconbridge, and
the nurseryman’s bill amounted to something
over £6O, with work still going on. So he com-
missioned his clerk to collect the money, and,
if Parkes didn’t part, to stop work. Getting.a
return ticket from Sydney, the clerk lay in
wait on Faulconbridge platform till Parkes came
to catch the train for Sydney. Then he presented
the bill. “But Hi can’t pav you now,” said
Parkes ;“ Hi ’aven’t got my cheque-book.” The
clerk immediately produced one. “ But Hi
want pen and hink.” “The station-master
will oblige.’’ “ But what habout stamps for
your receipt?” “I have the stamps, Sir
Henry.” So Parkes wrote out the
cheque. When the train came along
the clerk stayed on the platform till
the last moment, and swung into the
guard’s van just as the train started.
As the train entered Redfern Station he
jumped out, and a minute after was in
a cab, being driven furiously to the bank.
Arriving there, he presented the cheque.
The accountant presmtly appeared, and
made some demur —“the manager wasn’t
in.” “Damn the manager ! I don’t want
to see the manager. What’s the matter
with the cheque ? Isn’t it good ? ”
“Yes.” “Then why don’t you cash
it ?’’ The accountant “ caved,” and handed
over the cash. Going out the door, the
clerk came face to face with Parkes him-
self, hurrying in, having just alighted
from a cab. Parkes paused, surprised.
“Did you cash that cheque, sir?” he
gasped out. “Yes, Sir Henry.” “You
har a smart man, sir!” “Thank you, Sir
Henry. Good morning.”
Tom Playford, S.A.’s returned ex-Agent-
General, vowed before he went to England in 94
that be would never accept a title or wear Court
dress. Etiquette compelled him to break the
latter pledge, as his application to be allowed to
wear ordinary dress at big functions was refused,
but he stuck to the other and comes back un-

Shortly before his death, the clog-
critic of a leading Southern weekly had
one day exhibited for his approval a dog,
for which the Irish watchman of the office
had paid a, fiver. “Foinedog, ain’t he?”
queried the proud- proprietor. “ Well,
if you ask me,” was the reply, “I think
he’s a mere mongrel.” “ Mongrel is it !
—an’ him wid a pedigree as long as yer
arrum !” “Pedigree be hanged,” said the
expert; “ why, so’ve I. My father and
mother were gentlemen—and what am I ?”
A noble lord once voyaged to Maori-
land in tl.e old Aldinga, commanded by
Jock M'Lean “ Hellfire Jock.” The
ship ran into heavy weather. In the
middle of the night, when Mac. was
taking a rest in his cabin, he was disturbed
by a pale-faced flunkey attached to His
Ex’s suite. “His Hexcellency’s compli-
ments, sir,” mumbled the valet, “ hand
he wishes to know how long this weather
will last?” “Tell His Excellency,”
growled Jock, “ that I’m not in the confi-
dence of the Almighty, but that, as far as
I can judge, this damned weather will last
until it stops.”
The Chow, as a rule, doesn’t shine
as a shot; but there was one, appropriately
named Ah Wing, in Yic. North-eastern
district 30 years ago, who lived on his
markmanship. He used to enter a well-
filled bar, kick off bis shoes, and spread
his naked feet on the floor with the toes
wide apart. When the crowd would gather
round, Ah Wing would draw a revolver
and calmly plant six successive bullets in
as many of the spaces between his toes.
Then reloading, he would plug the two
remaining openings ; after which he would
go round with the hat. It was said that
in this way he scooped in dollars enough
in a couple of years to enable him to return
to China.
Argus editor Willoughby’s writing
i$ historical. He it was who once wrote
that Augustus had found Rome brick and
left it marble—only to read next day that
the eminent emperor had found Rome
Irish and left it miserable. (The original
yarn was fixed on Horace Greeley, and it
represented him as being made to say
that Augustus found Rome brisk and left
it miserable. But no matter.) _ Since his
elevation to the editorial he has
even beaten this record, for, the other day,
he penned how some organisation had
been “ welded into a homogeneous whole,”
and only just managed to stop the proof which
said it snorted like a Norwegian whale.”
One of the candidates for a suburban con-
stituency at the late N.S.W. general elections

his meetings. And he was among the most

As a rule, the Australian politician’s
political son sheds little lustre on the family
name. Better things are confidently expected
from young Barton, who has just left for
England, after winning a valuable scholarship at
King’s School, Parramatta, where he is considered
one of the most promising young men turned out
of that famous institution. Toby 11. was _ a
universal favorite, excelling equally in classics
and school sports. ,
Jimmy Ah How, a Chinaman, 83 years of
age, was banqueted at Tungamah (N.S.W.) one

paniment of gin gin hot, «in cold, gin neat, gin
grog, gin soup, and gin gravy.

Will. H. Ogilvie’s clever, original Bulle-

N.S.W. Speaker Abbott is in the Far
North, whither he journeyed in the company of
his medical adviser, Dr. Kyngdon. In his present
regrettable state of health he will, no doubt, hesi-
tate much before accepting so exhausting a post
as that of Speaker in an evenly-balanced House
where progress will be practically impossible. It
is reported that he has been medically advised to
quit politics altogether.
Through the death of his partner, half-
millionaire J. L. Currie, of Vic., Edward Quin,
who, as M.P. for Wentworth, had much to do
with shaping modern N.S.W. land-legislation,
becomes owner of Tarella, one of the best-known
Western squattages. It was Quin who prompted
Speaker Abbott to go to the Wentworth elector-
ate ; and Abbott, later on, responded by familiar-
ising the name of the homestead to Sydney-siders.
The Treasurer and Secretary of the Tongan
Govt, are models of responsible public officers.
They stick to business and produce accounts
which all interested understand. N.S.W. ex-
Premier Dibbs, with the unintelligible hash of
Australian financial statements on his mind, looked
in on these officials on his last visit to the islands,
and was pleasurably surprised at the clearness and
directness of their book-keeping. Neither wore
anything but a loin-cloth, but they balanced in-
come and expenditure better than the professed
experts he had known elsewhere.
A BAD CASE.

A recently-retired Southern Judge, noto-
rious for the severity of his sentences, thus once
delivered himself : “ Prisoner at the bar, it lies in
my power to inflict a term of 10 years’ imprison-

dealing leniently with you, and give you another
chance in life. With these views on my mind, I
direct that you be imprisoned for nine years.”
“ Britishah ” : Anticipating the Coro-
nation of the Prince of Wales, in West-
minster Abbey, I have been looking back to the
Gentleman’s Magazine, 1821, for a rapturous
account of the magnificent Coronation of George-
IV. (Yes, George the Fourth). It states he is
“ A Prince renowned for social virtues, and his
conduct of the Regency has stamped his name
with Immortality.”
Re the fact that Reid called Braddon a
lunatic at Melbourne Convention, the word does
not appear in the Convention official report,
although the Melb. reporting was remarkably full
and accurate. Reason why : Reid requested that
it should be left out. Hansard ohief refused to
leave it out unless by direction of the President.
Accordingly Kingston was seen, and, as a matter
of courtesy, consented to the phrase, of which
G.H.R. was ashamed, being eliminated.

J. L. Parsons, lately in Japan plotting for
the establishment of a big Jap. colony in the N.
Territory, has had a varied career in S.A. Origin-
ally a Baptist parson, he resigned, went into poli-
tics, and was Minister of Education in Bray’s
Ministry. Parsons then went to the Territory as
Govt. .Resident, resigned, and returned to politics
as member for the Territory. He was one of the
finest orators S.A. has had, but an embarrassing
weakness greatly handicapped him. He is a
brother-in-law of S.A. millionaire Angas.
Died, a few days ago, in Brisbane “ Billy
Brookes,” a sturdy old battler for a white Queens-
land. For over 30 years Brookes waged a tire-
less warfare against syndicate, exploiter and
Asiatic alien, to say nothing of many a tough
tussle over the Kanaka question. Was Griffith’s
colleague for N. Brisbane in the days of Sam the
Democrat; but the enlightened electors of that
Calico-Jimmy-ridden constituency threw over the
clean-handed old warrior for an—er —eminent
financier. Peace to Brookes’ ashes ! Had there
been more like him, Queensland would be a white
country to-day.
In Bismarck the world has lost a remark-
able exemplar of the fact that the most potent
longevity factor, after all, is “ the way we re
built.” After gorging mountains of heterogeneous
edibles, swilling lakes of wine and brandy and
beer, smoking tons of tobacco, working frequently
for 72 hours on end, sleeping just when he took
the notion, and generally up-ending all received
hygienic canons—the Iron Chancellor passes out
at 83; while Gladstone, who even regulated the
number of “chews” to a mouthful of food, only
tops that figure by a year or two—and what was
his “ life ” to Bismarck’s?
Rev. Dr. Geikie, whose death is chronicled,
led a Wandering Jew existence before coming to
Australia. From Edinburgh, where he was born,
he made his way to Canada, from Canada to tha
Crimea in Russia ; thence through the Muscovite
territory and back again through England and
Scotland ; once more he roamed Canada and the
States generally and finally dropped in on Austra-
lia. He was supposed to be a wit, and, certainly,
for a Presbyterian Scot he had a cheerful way of
looking at the world ; but he was at his best when
telling whisky stories. He spent 50 years “ minis-
tering ” in western N.S. Wales.
The unquenchable Tommy Walker, ex-
M.P. and many other things, turned up in Sydney,
after a temperance crusade in Maoriland, in tims
to be sent to the Barrier —as far away from the
Federalists’ committee-rooms as possible—to con-
test Sturt. The wordy apostle made nine different
attempts to get a hearing from the Broken Hill
miners, and failed every time ; he failed even after
the miners’ sec. had appealed on his behalf. Yet in
the adjoining electorate —the still “ hotter ” Labor
district of Alma —the bore-ish W. Harding, four-
penny-land-tax panjandrum, was suffered with
much patience—until polling-day.
The toughness of the Chow, m Mel-
bourne, the other day, Ah Kt e, while going down
a hotel lift, got his skull aad jaw fractured in
five places, his nose torn off, and his face almost
utterly destroyed. Then he bolted shrieking
through the hotel, dodged several people who
tried to capture him, climbed into his cart, and
drove, still howling dismally, about half-a-mile
through the heart of the city to the shop of a
Chinese friend. He arrived there dying, yet that
Chow had steered his horse through the crowded
streets without an accident. All things con-
sidered, it was a wonderful performance.

Employed on a notably “hungry ” station
was an ex-parson, and when the country was
suffering from severe drought the holy man re-
vealed his identity, and suggested prayer for rain.
The Hungry One, thinking of his stock, said :
“ We’ll give it a trial. It can’t do any harm,
anyway.” The supplications were started, and,
as it happened, rain came next day in torrents ;
whereupon the old man went for the parson.

“ Tot ” : Be manufacture of dingoes’ tails.
A certain shepherd on a well-known Barwon
station in ’Bl was an expert at the business. His
imitations—made out of ’possum tails and dingo
skins—were more lifelike than the real article.
He collected his 10s. reward very regularly for a
long time, till one day, when I was out with the
boss, the latter enforced his suspicions by a domi-
ciliary search. Under the bed was skin and tail
enough for six months’ manufacture. There was
a new hand with the rams next morning.

Dear Bulletin. — Be country fire brigades,
writer had to put up once at a small pub. in a
Vic. township, and about 9 p.m. one of the
chimneys caught fire. The landlady rushed out-
side yelling for the boys to run and ring the fire-
bell—situate about half-a-mile away ; but when a
quarter-hour passed and no tocsin, the old lady’s
abuse of fire-brigades and firemen was a caution.
As the chimney had been easily put-out, someone
asked her what she was so angry about. “ I’d
have thought,” said she, “ that any d fool
would know the ringin’ of that’d been worth £2

George came limping into camp dragging

abnormal, and he looked like the favorite victim
of a landslip. Of course we were overflowing

was it a cattle-rush, a horse-bolt, or a falling tree ?
Said George : “ I was down by the creek, and I

ing a cradle, and I went up behind him and said :
‘Muck a-hi, John ! You catchee good luck this

“ Tin-lip ” on ticks and things :
Dear Bulletin. —A possible way in which the tick
travels South otherwise than on the hides of stock. Met
a swaggie the other day on Mary River, Q., with a tin
matchbox containing two “ speciments ” (as he called
them) of ticks, alive and well. He had fed them all the
way down from the Fitzroy River on beef cadged from
stations. Said he and they (male and female) were mates,
and were making for N.S.W. Another probable cause of
spread is that when swaggies roll up their blankets in
the morning after a camp they probably often rollup
with them a stray tick or two off the ground, and the
hungry ticks drop out the following evening or the next
in search of food when the swag is unrolled. Quite
possible, in any case, that the average swaggie rather
approves of the spread of the tick, with a view of creating
future work in constructing yards, crush-pens, and
“dips.” I once saw a swaggie on the Maclntyre pluck-
ing burr-seeds, and, on inquiring what for, he calmly told
me that the bloomin’ squatters were giving no work down
Sonth, so he intended to make future burr-cutting for
himself by distributing burr-seeds at the heads of small
gullies on burr-less stations. Eain, of course, would
flood the gullies, and wash the seed down over the grassy
flats below. Also, the rabbit-pro of fence west of Mun-
gundi, on the N.S.W. and Queensland border, is con-
tinually being damaged by swaggies, to allow bunny to
pass into N.S.W.

A 7ft. alligator has been found in Bris-
bane (Q.) River—well to the south of the usual
habitat. His genesis is curious. An old Bris-
bane property-owner went up North to the John-
stone River and started sugar-growing. He
trapped a small alligator, last year, and sent
it down to Brisbane to a friend. The friend
was just about to sell the saurian to a menagerie
man when the intelligent ’gator escaped from its
tank. The specimen now noticed was seen in
mangrove mud near the mouth of the river, and
by its size is reokoned to be “ the very identical.”

A.L.W. : Have had much experience of
cika (pron. “ theeka ”) and as every sufferer there-
from doesn’t live within reach of corrosive-subli-
mate, sulphate of alum, and so on, I will give a
remedy with which I have cured myself and
innumerable natives. Every white in the outlying
Fiji islands keeps on hand a stock of laudanum,
castor oil, salts, and sulphate of zinc. For cika I
put as much of the last as will lie on a sixpence
into a square gin-bottle of water (said bottles
always plentiful in a trader’s or missionary’s back-
yard). Shake well; and, when dissolved, pour a
little into corner of affected eye. Levuka cika,
such as “ Tui Ovalau’s,” is a very mild affair com-
pared with that of the outlying islands where the
flies (carriers of the disease) are as unspeakable by
day as are the mosquitoes and sand-flies by night,
and where there are large mangrove swamps such
as on north coast of Yanua Levu. The time to
look out most for the curse is when the reeds are
in flower.

“Cecil P.” : At Esperance Bay (W.A.)
once I had been filling a man up with ordinary
geographical information when he seemed to get
disheartened, and said, with a weary air, “ Well,
travelers do tell some crammers. A cove I knew
went to Perth once, and he told me as how there
was over 20 pubs, there. The liar ! As if 20 pubs,
could get a living in one place ! ” Again, near
Dubbo, recently, I chipped into a pub. discussion
with some remarks about mountain devil (west of
the Great Lakes), the arboreal kangaroo, and the
carnivorous plant, and was promptly awarded the
scone. They even damned me with faint praise
by conceding that I was the finest liar in Dubbo
district. Again, told a man in same district of
how the blacks on the great Bight wade quietly
into the sea with concealed lights, form a semi
circle, suddenly flash their glims, splash their way
inshore with all the row they can make, and
frighten many of the fish on to the beach. My
listener was insulted at my estimate of his swal-
lowing capacity. If you wish to be believed by
ill-informed people, tell lies.

“ Ponte ” : Be taking off boots to promote
warmth. Wearing boots at all is mere matter of
habit. Sailors and fishermen, who wear them
least, retain much of the natural prehensile power
of the toes (observable in children before being
booted.). Have seen fishermen also strike matches
on their indurated soles, and have heard of them
walking on broken glass for a pint of beer. Which
reminds The Bulletin that once, when “ Footy ”

pinching power of his toes—had charge of a dis-
tinguished fishing-party, he was instigated by

the culprit was a huge crab in the bottom

“5.0.” : Be Kangaroo-tail-action. On
Well town station was often seen a large kangaroo
that had his tail cut off short. Tried to run him
down, but he was too good in the dead myall, and
always got to the scrub. He never attempted to
stand upright to look round, but took the mob’s
opinion for it if anything was wrong. He was
well known to the blacks round there, and they
would not kill him if they got a chanoe.

“ Karagi ” : Along the Great Australian
Bight—a thirsty locality—the aboriginal ekes out
his water-supply with the dew which falls heavily
there. He gathers it with a ball of dry grass
swept as a sponge over the dew-laden surface, and
then squeezed into a coolamon; or, holding the ves-
sel under a tree or shrub, he brings the dew down
with a gentle tap. The desert oak (casuarina decais-
neana) also stores in its roots and stem water
which, though colorless upon extraction, turns
brown after a few hours. In the hot season, when
little or no water is in the various waterholes, the
supply in these trees is at its greatest, probably
because of the heavy demand then made by the
more rapid evaporation. In Centralia another
source of supply is the “water frog,” which, at
the approach_ of the dry season, fills up with
water and buries itself in the mud until the next
rainy season.

and averaged 30 miles a day. Also, once, just to
decide whether a swag was essential to long
journeys, writer and another started from campon
the Herbert River with only a pannikin, some
rice, and smoking-gear. Meandered along to
Foslebrook and up the York line to Mein, but
found the blacks too hostile to continue, so strolled
back to Cooktown, thence via Herberton and
Cardwell to our camp. Lived mainly on scrub-
plumbs and pig-weed, smoked leaves and honey-

The Massey-Harris Co. Ltd., of Broadway
George-street west, Sydney, and of Melbourne,
Dunedin, and Brisbane, is an agricultural machin-
ery firm of excellent reputation. It is just the
kind of firm that is needed in the agricultual in-
dustry of Australia. For it is remarkably pro-
gressive ; it sticks to its business right along ; it
starts early and works well; and in the evening it
hatches out plans for improvement. The firm
takes the lead in N.S.W. ; last season its sales of
cultivators and ploughs were phenomenal; and now
it is rolling its sleeves up and thinking and pre-
paring for the coming harvest. The Massey-
Harris Co. say that N.S.W. should not only feed
her own people, but should export largely to the
Northern Hemisphere. As the agriculturist of
N.S.W. and Australia generally is given to waiting
on the Micawber principle for something to turn
up, he is hereby admonished to adopt the Massey-
Harris principle and turn up the shirt-sleeves
right away.*

“Yes!” said the horse-tailer, “most
half-castes is liars, and many on ’em’s thieves.
Remember cornin’ down the Bulloo in 'Bl with
cattle. We had one of the smartest half-castes in
our camp I ever seen, among horses, I mean, and
tracks and that, but he wouldn’t work ; not him.
Hadn’t got time ! Well, it was hot, dry times,
and the ground was pretty hard, and he was yarn-
ing at dinner-camp about tracking. ‘There ain’t
no blackfellow on earth could track me if I wanted
to get away,’says Yellow Charley, ‘let alone a
white one.’ ‘ You must ’a got a pocket-balloon
about yer,’ says the boss, ‘or maybe angel’s
wings.’ ‘ No.’ says the other, ‘ but what I says I
means, and I’ll answer a fiver none o’ them niggers
there can’t track me.’ Now, there was five o’ our
station blacks in camp—all smart fellows, for one
of ’em, Tiger, went inside afterwards to track the
Kelly gang—and the boss looks over at us, and I
says, ‘l’ll take you up for half of it, Charley,’
and the boss chips in at once with the other half.
The conditions were these: I wrote on a piece
of paper the name of our station and
brand, and showed this to the niggers, and
Charley told ’em he’d plant it in the fork of a
mulga, and if they brought it into camp we’d give
’em a couple o’ bottles o’ rum next pub. We was
to give him ten minutes’ start and the boss
answered the stakes. When time was up, the
boss and three blacks cantered along his horse-
tracks about half-a-mile, when we see his horse tied
to a brigalow tree near a dry creek. We held the
blacks’ horses while they hunted round for tracks.
The ground wasn’t bad for tracking, but we could
see from the start they was bothered. They fos-
sicked round the root o’ the tree where the horse
was tied, and they kept circling out and out on
both sides of the creek, but devil a sign they
struck. There was stacks of kangaroo and emus’
tracks about, and the niggers was mighty parti-
cular about the appearance of ’em, but they saw
nothing suspicious, and after an hour or more they
gave it up. ‘ Baal find him, boss. Fly away
that fellow,’ says Tiger. ‘Nothing track all
about. Debil-Debil I think it.’ So we come
back to camp without the paper and there was
yellow Charley lying down. Well, we had to give
in we was licked, but the beggar never blowed
about it nor nothing, and not till months after-
wards did he let on how he’d had us. Had it all
readied up. A pair of emu feet cut short and
sewed on to a moccassin was what he put on afore
he got off his horse, and then, walking behind a
mob of emus he had started for the purpose, he
took a roundabout for the camp. But he got the
fiver ; and the man —black, white or brindle—who
(■ould lick the niggers deserved the money; ”
S.M. Herald item
In any case, of course, it is taken for granted by all that
Mr. Reid will make a batch of new appointments to the
Legislative Council. There is room for a dozen, and
amongst them in all likelihood will be Messrs. Gould,
Sydney Smith, Garrard, Frank Farnell, L. C. R. Jones,
and possibly Mr. Miilen, and several others.
Every man on the above list is a discarded poli-
tician whom the country has just refused to en-
trust with a commission to help govern it for
the short term of three years. So it is suggested,
quite as a matter of course, that they should be
•mpowered, without the country’s consent, to
help govern N.S.W. for life. And that is self-
government and majority rule !
The Bulletin has frequently contended
that that Shylock’s engine of oppression, the at-
tachment of wages, has been mainly brought into
existence through the unforeseen and unintended
operation of a system of procedure and set of rules
in the fifties in England. M‘Cay and Isaacs used
this argument with such effect in the debate on
this subject in Vic. Assembly lately that crusted
Conservatives like Murray Smith and his pals
held a hasty conference and decided to become
converts to the economic fallacy of protecting the
wage-earner. Madden, of course, stood out stub-
bornly, and contended that to pass the Bill would
mean the further weakening of the working j man’s
backbone. The Bill seems likely to pass, anyway.
Evans, Anderson and Phelan, of Brisbane,
built a number of locomotives for Q. Govt. Then
they suggested that they should go ahead with
more, seeing that more were wanted. But Bris-
bane had bounced out Tomjoe Byrnes (now
Premier) on to the top of his bighead. Bequest
refused. Walkers Limited, of Maryborough, built
30 locomotives. Maryborough had returned two
Nelsonian members. When Byrnes became
Premier, these two members talked hostility, and
actually endeavored to form another party. Then
Walkers Limited asked for’lOinore locos, to build,
and got them at a price equal to 10 per cent,
above previous contract figure. Annear and Bar-
tholomew, the Maryborough members, affirm
their loyalty to Byrnes. “ They marched about
and turned about and did just so ; and every time
they turned about they jumped Jim Crow.” All
this seems simple enough to the raw mind of the
ordinary voter. But “ Railways ” Murray says
that there was no political taint in the trans-
action ; it was a mere “ error of judgment ” on his
part. As Admiral Dewey said to the German
naval captain—“ It would be better if these things
were done in a different way.”
His emphatic rejection at Singleton, which
he had allegedly represented for many years, is a
nasty knock for the much-gilded N.S.W. Justice-
Minister Gould —he has lately made a big fortune
by a lucky copper-spec. His thick-headed and
callous refusal to enquire into the shocking Suf-
field case was, no doubt, the straw which broke
the camel’s back. A big majority of electors cried
“ Hooshta ! ” and the erstwhile gaol-gag tolerator
had to lie down. Had he been returned, he would
(or ■ might) have succeeded Speaker Abbott as
President of N.S.W. Assembly, and, in due course,
have become “Sir Albert.” Now, destitute of
even Buckley’s show of getting an Assembly seat,
it is variously proposed to “ put him in the Upper
House and continue him as Minister of—save the
mark !—Justice ; and send him to England as
Agent-General—which Heaven forbid ! Let not
the fair province of N.S.W. be typified in Eng-
land by one looking like the icy ghost of Hunger.
Even if a rich country has to dole out blankets to
white men at election-time in order that the Cab-
bage-tree gang may continue to milk the Treasury,
let us put forward as its representative abroad
some warm-blooded politician who is reasonably
fat. N.S.W. owes too much money abroad to let
the scraggy Albert John Gould stand up on its
behalf at London city dinners.
When all is over, Barton will probably be
the first Premier of United Australia. Or Chief
Justice —as he chooses. And if, to-day, all N.S.
Wales again voted as one constituency, Barton
would be on top. His mana was never so great as
now. His Bismarckian move in giving battle at
King Division inspired his party with enthusiasm
and enormously added to his prestige.
“ H.” : Federation is accomplished. This
was my thought when a crowd gathered outside
the Argus office on Wednesday night, panting for
he issue of the N.S.W. elections, as posted up.

At least six members of the present N.S. Wales

Leperland pretends to be angry with S.A.
Premier Kingston for saying that he knew nothing
about the Chinese who were swagging it from
Port Darwin (N.T.) to Camooweal (N.Q.), which
Chows had to be gaoled in lieu of payment of poll-
tax ; also, that he was ignorant of every circum-
stance connected with the landing at Thursday
Island (Q.) of 59 Japs with passports to the
Northern Territory. This is rich from the land
where a whole town takes its hat off to the dirtiest
Chinaman walking, which has made an immigra-
tion treaty “ on its own ” with Japan, and which
lives largely on slave - Kanakas, and is now
manoeuvring to import slave-Papuans.
Close on £24.000,000 is to be Bull’s little

diture in again going one better than Russia in

Whether the Meat Ring (which Premier
Forrest says doesn’t exist) or the Government

how, Something which wasn’t the Government re-

weighing-machine at home has to trust to luck
and other uncertain circumstances —including the

Melb. Argus's obituary notice of ex-
Police Superintendent Nicholson is typical of
“respectable” journalism. Mr._ Nicholson’s
zealous service and deeds of derring-do in his
thief-taking capacity get a column of eulogy,
whereas the Govt, job of converting the police-
officer into a police-magistrate is hardly referred
to. “It was determined,” says the Argus, in a
casual way, “ that both he and Mr. Hare should
be transferred to other branches of the service, and,
as a consequence, he was appointed a police-
magistrate, a duty which he discharged with
credit and honor.” With honor, as regards his
personal character, but not with credit. It was
under the amateur management of Nicholson,
P.M., that Rappiport, Baxter, and co. brought
the unpaid magistracy into open contempt, and
the exposure and disgrace of “ old Rappy ” was
accomplished by Lormer, J.P., despite poor
Nicholson’s disposition to ignore the scandal.

Pattie Browne.
“I was never bashful,” says Pattie Browne,
“in clothes like these; but when I first wore
tights —at fourteen —I had to be pushed upon the
stage. I was born at Parramatta where the
oranges grow. My mother, who is aged 70, is still
alive, with the voice of 40 years and the laugh of
a silver bell.” So it is clear how Pattie comes by
her voice, which in “ The Little Minister ” breaks
in so musicallv on the heavy Scotch air.
She says : “ I began my stage career at 13 years
of age in the old Theatre Royal, Syd-
ney, in Irish dramas, under Williamson
and Musgrove. I did two years in
opera-bouffe with Emilie Melville ; and
when the Triumvirate joined forces
they gave me one year’s engagement
sometimes I played in pantomime,
sometimes in opera - bouffe. My first
attempt at big comedy was with Gene-
vieve Ward and W. H. Vernon, my
part being Abigail in ‘ The Queen’s
Favorite,’ a tremendous success. After-
wards I played under Mr. Williamson
in such parts as Reggie in ‘ Harbor
Lights,’ until he lent me to Messrs.
Brough and Boucicault to play Honor
in ‘Sophia.’ Honor is my favorite
part; she has the most delightful
oomedy running right through her ; she
is so light and breezy. The best comedy
line I know was Tith.’s lovely line in
‘ Sophia ’ —‘ If you object to the shirt
I’ll shift it.’
“The Brough-Boucicault Comedy co.,
with Mr. and Mrs. Brough as the
sweet, dear doves, and with Mr. Dion
Boucicault as stage-manager and pre-
siding genius, was as good a comedy
co. as ever existed. Had we toured
America, we should have made small
fortunes. My regular salary with this
co. was £l5 per week; but after they
gave me my conge, of which I shall
speak directly, they were stumped for
somebody to play my part in ‘The
Country Girl.’ It was the Melbourne
season, so I made them sit up and pay
me £3O per week.
“My conge, a month’s notice, was
given me in the most cruel manner. I
was engaged to be married to Mr. Dion
Boucicault, and, as he was manager,
it fell upon him to notify me. My dis-
missal was instigated by actresses who
were jealous of me—who objected to the
newspapers giving me such praise for
my part as Peggie in ‘ The Country
Girl’—actresses who said they would
not have a stock actress made a star of.”
“ Actresses or actress ? ”
“ Well, why not tell the truth—yes !
let’s have the truth —one particular ac-
tress. It was her jealousy that got me
my co ngb, for no reason at all except
that I made a stock part a star part.
“ Mine was such a love affair. I was
engaged for eight years to Mr. Dion
Boucicault —and eight years, you know,
is a long stretch out of a woman’s life.
I could not go to a luncheon, nor do
this nor that; everyone knows how an
engaged woman is restricted. I thought
it best to break it off in the end, so I wrote from
England to Dion in Australia and ended it all.
“ I was with the Brough-Boucicault co. for five
years, and it was from Dion that I received all my
polish. He staged the plays, and it was from him
alone that every actor and actress of the company
acquired his or her polish. Next to Pinero, he is
the finest stage-manager I have ever seen. When
I was leaving Australia for England he gave me
letters of introduction to his old friend, Pinero,
and other celebrities, and smoothed my way in
London to the degree that my first part there—
Thomasene, in ‘ The Amazons ’—was written for
me by Pinero. It was a tremendous success, and
I received £l5 a week salary. Just before I left
London for this Australian tour, I thanked Dion
for all the trouble he had taken to make me an
actress. His reply was : ‘ Pattie ! actresses are
born —not made.’
“ My English career began with five months in
bed, laid up with the lovely climate, with fogs,
snows, rains, and darkness. Both my doctors
ordered me back to Australia, but 1
determined to remain. During my six
years in England I was never out of
an engagement—-in lovely theatres—
and my lowest salary was =£ls per
week, and my highest <£3o. And
these salaries were, clear ; all costumes,
hats, shoes, gloves were found ns ; and
we went to such houses as Jay’s, in
Regent-street, or Russell and Allan’s,
in Bond-street—swagger people. My
wig alone, in the Lady Godiva scene
of the ‘ White Heather,’ cost 80 gui-
neas. Altogether, four parts were
written for me in England —Thomas-
ene, Lady Molly Fanshaw, Annette
Donelly, "and Kitty Parker. I was
naturally very nervous when I made
my debut in London, but directly I
found the strength of my voice was
there, the nervousness left me, and I
didn’t feel nervous through the rest
of the performance. lam more ner-
vous singing than acting; but I’m
afraid I’m one of those people who
stop at nothing; if they tell me I’m
to play a policeman next week I’m there.”
Here the hotel-messenger knocked at the door,
and announced the name of a well-meaning Syd-
ney gentleman. Miss Browne, after an effort at
recollection, said : “ I cannot remember him ;
oh, well! —I think you had better say that Miss
Browne is not in.” The messenger departed with
his conventional statement. “It is not a fib to
say I am not in,” remarked Miss Browne,
“ because the Bishop himself sanctions the hoary
custom ; and every actress who is an actress has
to adopt the Bishop’s rendering.
“In London the impressionable old man gener-
ally makes a halt at the Gaiety, and in London
the impressionable young man is much more in
evidence than he is in Australia. Many unknown
admirers have sent me diamonds, brooches,
watches, and letters. I have kept the jewellery;
and worn it as well. I haven’t got up to a tiara
yet; so if some amiable person will send me a
good one, I will promise to play my very best
whenever he chooses to attend the theatre.
“The rehearsing which I most enjoyed was
‘Trelawney of the Wells ; ’ we had such fun with
the crinolines. But after a while we all got used
to them. My character of Saucers in ‘A Bit of
old Chelsea ’ I formed by personally studying the
London flower girls for make-up, accent, and
everything. Saucers is a character sketch with a
moral»to it. I left London debating whether it
was nice or naughty, naughty or nice. To under-
stand what a London flower-girl is, Australians
must hear Saucers say ‘ Thank goord I’m up ’a.’ ’’

“In Queensland Parliament Mr. Byrnes
made a modest statement announcing his accession
to the Premiership.” A modest statement by
Byrnes. Well, that ivas worth wiring.
P. E. Quinn’s election for Bligh division
at N.S.W. general election was due as much as
anything else to the exertions of a little band of
brother journalists, who canvassed for him, spoke
for him, and quite won the hearts of the “ push.”
“ Don’t you bring any of them lawyer coves, with
their shaved chivvies and their (adjective) bleat,
down ’ere; yous coves is quite big enough toffs
for us,” said a scrawny-necked Woolloomoolooite,
as he rolled up a cigarette.
Reported that a recent Q. Cabinet meet-
ing nearly ended in a quarrel. Among Premier
Byrnes’ intimates it is whispered that the Cabinet
will burst from internal, not external agencies.
The moss-grown, reactionary influence dominates,
and Byrnes’ recent catch-vote promises of reform
have disgusted and frightened some of his fattest
and most influential supporters. The Q. boodler
wants a Premier who will brusquely tell the elec-
tors to go to the devil—one who will “stiffen”
returning-officers, illegally disqualify Democratic
nominations, disfranchise “ doubtful ” electors
wholesale—in fact, commit any enormity short of
a land-tax to bolster the status quo. Byrnes
seems anxious to at least appear to fight his battle
on the merits of his argument.
An angry deputation of a thousand Hobart
citizens requested Treas. Fysh’s attendance in the
local Town Hall the other day, and demanded to
know whether he was for or against his Hobart
constituents in the matter of theßailway Syndicate
trouble. In view of Premier Braddon’s declared
intention of granting certain leases to the Emu
Bay co.—the Crown Law officers having declared
the proceedings quite legal—Fysh was asked to
vote for a motion then before the House, said
motion having for its object the prohibition of
said leases. (There are two syndicates and
Hobart favors the other grab). The old man
forgot his usual flowery phrases and faced the
angry meeting with a flat refusal. In response to
howls and hoots and cries of “ Resign your seat ! ”
he yelled defiance at what he called “a Tasmanian
mob,’’and stalked majestically out of the building.
The deputation then promptly and unanimously
carried a resolution calling upon Fysh to resign.
But old P. Fysh, who has represented Hobart or
its county off and on since 1866, sent back a shriek
of mockery on a large sheet of paper, and remains.
Fysh was born in London, and has concealed his
scorn of the islanders for close on 40 years, but
that jeer at “ a Tasmanian mob ” was the sudden
bursting of the boiler of the old man’s soul.
Billiardists C. Dawson and J. P. Mannock,
now making a flying tour through Australasia,
should have charms for everybody who under-
stands the difference between playing billiards and
mere prodding of the “ spot ” or “plain ” ball with
a cue. They are attractive artists, both of them.
Mannock is known as a clever fancy stroker,
whilst Dawson ranks as second-to-none at the all-
round English game. He is the little man who
lately challenged big rival John Roberts to a
match for money, push-stroke barred, and the fact
that Roberts didn’t close with the offer points to
Dawson as the coming champion. Anyway, he is
the accepted leader of the revolt against the
“ push,” which always unsatisfactory and disputed
stroke seems doomed to die when Roberts shall
cease to boss-the show. Roberts, having brought
the push to perfection, is entitled to use it in his
game until his sun goes down. Meanwhile Daw-
son goes on improving himself at all-round billiards
pure and undefiled. His rapid play is an educa-
tion for ad vanced amateurs, and a capital enter-
tainment for intelligent “ muffs."

The maintenance of Privy Council appeals,
which is to be stubbornly fought for on the
amended Federal Constitution Bill, will, if carried,
give Q. Premier Byrnes a chance to shunt Sam
Griffith to England. Byrnes was the first to pro-
pose the addition of an Australian Judge to the
P.C. Bench, but on terms which would make his
residence in England necessary and as a conse-
quence leave a Chief-Justiceship vacant.
The return of Terry for Ryde leaves the
N.S.W. Parliament without a representative of
the Farnell family for the first time for over 30
years. Farnell’s father was only beaten once (by
“Yooey ” Taylor) and was immediately appointed
to the Leg. Council as representative of hisparty in
the Upper House, Farnell, sen. was in Parlia-
ment for 26 years, and his son for 12. A seat in
the Leg. Council is supposed to be awaiting the
beaten Frank.
One of the surprises of the N.S.W. election
was the rejection of old H. H. Brown, after 25
years representation of Durham electorate. A
unique explanation of this unexpected defeat is
that some of his wealthier supporters backed their
man at long odds for a good sum, and that some
of his supposed friends, knowing that a strong
opponent was in the field, took up the bets and, by
working tooth-and-nail for the enemy, landed the
money.
An S.M. Herald item, to be gummed in
the great unanimous hat of this free country :
Mr. Reid now sees many more virtues in the Upper
House as it is at present constituted than'he used to.
This is one of the great political sores that he was to have
reformed out of existence, and his language to the Coun-
cil, when it was obdurate about his direct taxation pro-
posals, was the language of a political agitator. Now he
speaks of a mild and scarcely appreciable alteration in
the system of nomination, and practically the “reform”
would amount to nothing at all. The reason for this
change of front is perfectly clear. Dr. MaeLaurin and
Sir Julian Salomons, the Messrs. Heydon and all their fol-
lowing, guided and animated by Mr. Want, will always be
useful to block the path of Federation. If Mr. Reid were
returned to power there is nothing to prevent him from
proceeding with Federation, and sending it to his friends
m the Upper House, who might be relied on to strangle it.
Then there would be a deadlock, and Mr. Reid could
thunder through the country for the reform of the coun-
cil once more, whilst Federalism looked after itself. Of
course such tactics could not for long be successful, but
Delay is the great thing in the philosophy of desperate
politicians, who clutch at straws.
Chocolat-Menier, the famous French choco-
late, is a delightful, clean, wholesale confection,
the newest and best thing upon this market.
Ladies who wish to enjoy themselves, and children
who want to be happy, should keep themselves
always supplied with Chocolat-Menier.*
John Plumper Hoolan, the wild Ishmael
of Q. Assembly : “ I cannot speak for any parti-
cular party in the State but myself. I belong to
no party at present, and am attached to no parti-
cular creed just at this moment. There is too
much of a mixture. Until politics are more
defined than they are now, I shall have to play a
lone hand, or organise and initiate a show on my
own account.”
There was a nice little row in Tas.
Assembly the other night over Attorney-General
Urquhart’s connection with a pair of handcuffs
lost by a constable in a street scuffle at Ring-
ville. Next morning the Attorney-General
brought the missing handcuffs to the police with
the playful remark “ that he supposed they’d like
to know where he got ’em,” and the trouble arose
over the fact that Urquhart declined to prosecute
the constable’s principal assailant because the
“ trap ” had not been in uniform, though, strange
to say, this point was not raised on behalf of two
other men who were fined £5 each for assaulting
same policeman at same time.
Seven or eight women and a doctor or two
now being under committal for alleged “illegal
practices ” gives The Bulletin a pretext for
printing this very downright letter
Ed. Bulletin.— lt is hinted that my remarks about the
woman who tearfully begs the doctor to operate for abor-
tion are viewed from the wrong point. As to my sweep-
ing assertion that no woman who goes to a doctor on
that errand deserves help, when you come to place a doc-
tor’s life, liberty, and reputation in the scale against the
natural and just penalty a woman incurs for an act done
for her own wanton pleasure, there can be no doubt about
it. The undersigned knows more, from practical experi-
ence, of the seamy side of lovely woman than all the
theorists and thinkers this side of Hades, and his conclu-
sion is that all women who indulge in illicit pleasures are
unprincipled. They have no moral principle, to
with : their commercial principle is unsound, or they
would not part with a valuable asset and pay a heavy
price for the privilege. They are deceitful, for they do
it in the belief it will not be found out. If all women
had to be seduced in the public street, there would be
no seduction, for they fear exposure, at first, more than
they fear God or love pleasure. They are weak, and
weak people are cruel and selfish—therefore dangerous :
hence my remarks that the doctor should fire them out
before he hears their tale, sees their tears, or lets his
manly pity get on top and strangle his discretion. The
only way out of it is to legalise abortion or abolish ille-
gitimacy. A single girl has as much right to have a baby
as a bicycle, if she wants one, but, as Society forbids her
to have the former, she tries to get rid of it. If the oper-
ation seems likely to end fatally, her ingratitude and
utter want of principle make her betray the man who
did his best to help her. If the betrayal 'could save her
life, one could probably excuse the act, but the same
wantonness and depravity which got her into trouble im-
pel her to do all the harm she can before making her
final exit. It is like the thief splitting on his “ pals,”
not because it will do him any nood, but his mean nature
finds consolation in the fact that he will not suffer alone.

A.F. : It’s only the skeleton of a story —we
don’t like huge carcases, but you can leave a little flesh
on the bones. Also too close to Bierce’s “Man and the
Snake” as it stands R.G. :No good V.K. : Sorry
can’t use; but you’re occupied with yourself and don’t
hit the nail . Fred B. : Now, if you had shot the two
swans through their necks with a rifle-bullet that would
have been a remembersom-•fluke D.J.O.D. : Premier
Reid was born in Scotia . i L.L. : Many thanks
Mendo: Bulletin did not enthusiastically approve of
every aspect of the thing, and would not gladly father
the sentiments therein conveyed—granting for the
sake of argument that the story meant exactly what
you say it did (which it didn’t). But it was a most
artistic story, and, despite all that can be said against
it, t’would have been a burning shame to reject it...
Federationist: Another attempt to damn the good cause.

Premier Ranji Biondi Reid Clo : When a Shepherd
gets the offer of another billet at a bigger “ screw ” he
consults the Lord on the matter of accepting it. And
the Lord almost invariably advises him to make tracks
for the new vineyard A.E. : Opposition comment on
the new policy of the Vic. Cycling Govt, is not unbiassed.
F. Lawliss : Ancient King Division : Bulletin
does not look for immediate victories or instant popular
applause. On big questions of principle it has been con-
tent to peg away for years, careless who got the credit of
the ultimate win. Bulletin writes to please itself
O.R. : Better say no more about the matter. Impossible
to put a remorseless usurer on a pedestal. As a man
sows, so shall he reap . D.G. (Trent.): Suggestions for
illustration uninviting everything being left to artist
Edit., Nom de plume isn’t French. The
words of which it is lomposed are French words, but no
Frenchman uses such a phrase. Nom de plume is cockney
French. Just as “ rosbif ” is French English Artist :
Nothing in it. Besides, you a’.en’t an artist E.C. :
Author’s name must be at beginning or end of each MS.
To give name in accompanying letter is no safeguard
A.H.J. : We sympathise; but ’tisn’t good enough
Veldt: So Frank Nankivell, in U.S. A., is turning Parkes’s
hair to excellent illustration account. “ Imperial Caesar,
dead and turned to clay, Doth stop a hole to keep the
wind away.” Scrum-half : Doggerel merely
K.N.W. :It died very easily J.B. : You have ground
of action against the man who maliciously dubs you co-
respondent, without evidence ; but it will probably be a
tough action, and you are hereby cautioned to pick your
steps D.T. : Very like it C.A.B. Alas! V.T.
(Q.): So, son, you have fallen in, and come to this foun-
tain-head of wisdom for advice and consolation. For con-
solation, forget the jade in another ; for advice : Never
appeal to a woman’s reason—she hasn’t any. Appeal to
her instincts, sentiments, emotions, passions. Feed her
continually with flattery, caresses, talkee-talkee—don’t
give her one full meal and leave her —she’s always
hungry, like the grave. Amuse her; don’t joke with her
—it’s dangerous ; never joke at her —it’s fatal. Keep the
iron hand in silken glove ; besiege only while waiting the
mment to assault. Don’t take a “ No” —tell her 999 times
that she’s as lovely as Heaven, and you love her like the
devil, and the 1000th time you’ll get her —and be mighty
sorry for it Nimium : Bulletin’s sometimes bright
and maybe shallow on the white pages because it feels
that way, and because dunderheads like you appreciate
it that way. And it’s sometimes dull and maybe pro-
found on the Red Page because it feels that way. And
if it feels any other way it’ll let her go promptly C. :
But Glassey doesn’t want praise for talking. Taik is hie
recreation ; it's when he’s silent that he works hard
E.H. : Look like tired American jokes Cum grano :
Long space ; short merit F.W.H. : Not grit enough
H.M. : Dull re-statement Ace : Many thanks .... H.H. :
Tale no good; one picture of no account; other one
should get you six months’ hard Bluey : Item about
your” blanky” candidate to hand .... T. Johns: Weak
trifle J.M.S. :It takes an artist to make the spelling
and grammar funny enough for publication. Your man
isn’t an artist Redlight: Reads like a very ordinary
horse-yarn, or else we haven’t enough horse in our soul
to appreciate its true inwardness Constant Reader
(Queensland): Two verses of your soul-cry to your best
girl :
Five long days has passed away
But how I long to see
And clasp you to my breast my love
My own dear Emily
The day was sad when you left me love
And hopes all seemed to fly
Be true be true to me my love
And I’ll be true to thy.
Which last line is fiendishly funny Andrew Scrambler :
Not much as mere verse. Is it the cry of a broken heart,
or what? Tomeli: Yes, good name, “ Dropper Reid,”
isn’t it? Delighted : Confused tale about a gamp
Peter Mangrove : Sorry, but while the N.S.W. general
election was on and Federation trembled in the balance,
there was no time to drivel much about Wales’s broken
leg A.J.G. : Higgledy-piggledy kind of verse
Redmot: Told that story long ago Retsbew : Re-
ceived. Address sufficient. Yes ; better on every sheet.
XXX. : One unprintable; other antique. ... Sairey
G. : Some usable. Don’t be so vicious Paraite : Some-
what discounted by over-spinning. Rufa : You dive so
deeply into your mystery that you never come up again.
WilliamF.: Ice too thin D.D. : Doubly d—d !
Mesa : Very good story of its kind ; sorry not our kind]
Yanko : Couldn’t say till we’ve seen it O.S. :
Don’t require biographical instruction, thanks ! .... Sam :
We must have clipping of newspaper report (attached to
heading of paper, with date) of all cases thus commented
on. In such matters, can’t afford to take anyone’s word.
W. H. D.: But, then, your assertion that N. S. W.’s “No ”
“ rang out” is a lie to begin with. It was “Yes” that rang
out. And Tasmania never asked to be “ maintained." It
agreed to pay its own interest bill and railway deficit, and
to stand the same taxes, and contribute as much per
head to the Commonwealth as N.S.W. So that’s another
lie. And N.S.W. never offered to “ yield its rivers, lands
or wealth.” That’s the third lie Yinto : Mainly dirt
and curses T'other Side of the Medal: Didn’t even
read the Age’s article on H. George, and haven’t time or
space to refute everything Fitzroy : Horrid jingle.
Alex. S.: Tale about unwashed grandfather not up to
mark ......Geoffrey : Laborious joke of great tonnage toil-
ing up-hill S.V.K.: Tale of horror, with unsatisfactory
ending. ... _C.W.S. : Unfederated Australia has as many
naturalisation laws as it has provinces. A person natu-
ralised in one of them is naturalised in that one only and
in England, whereas a person naturalised in England is
naturalised in all of them. Federated Australia will be
able to end that anomaly A.W.S. : But, tell us—What
does a doctor do when his name is Butcher, Gore or
Slaughter? R.H.T. : Great promise—if indeed first
essay. ..Tut: Yes—tut-tut! N.M.: Too tamely told..
Jack-Shay : About the decayed clergymen who sleep in

are you quite sure that they are clergymen? Present
writer once in the Domain fell over a man who sat up with
a snort and said he was a duke J.C.H. : Sketches un-

Mack : The Bulletin said “There’s no civilisation where

sons who are willing and ready to work it isn’t civilised.
Civilisation has hardly started yet. And now you may
go out and scoff again F.J.M‘O. : The U.S. began with
a Dutch and British population in the east and French
and Spanish population in the south and west. It con-
tains 71 million negroes ; million white foreigners, of
whom 1 j million are British ; and 46 million white
Americans. The latter are mostly descended from the 16
million immigrants who entered the U.S. between 1820

This is one of the largest purchases of any single
line of Patents we have made, and although Bile Beans are
as yet unknown In Queensland, the quantity sold by us in
N. S. S. warrants the outlay.
Trusting that the exceptional demand in this Colony will

Our last purchase (40,000 boxes) of Bile Beans has
been exhausted much earlier than we anticipated ) in fact,
the sale of this Proprietary Medioine has been larger and
more rapid than any other that has come under our notice.
We have now to request as early delivery as possible of
A further supply of six thousand dozen (72,000 boxes).
Our last order, when given, was considered a record*
breaker for Victoria, but the present one, representing
In value about £4,000, will probably establish an Austra-

FOR
BILE BEANS-THEIR ORIGIN AND USE.
Bile Beans owe their existence to the discovery by an American medical man of a certain vegetable substance that has the effect in the digestive organs ol
nature’s own animal bile. This discovery is revolutionising all the recent theories and remedies for digestive ailments. The old theory of pepsin, bismuth, starving,
purging, &c., &c., is to be done away with. This great vegetable substance is compounded with other ingredients to facilitate the working, and to-day this remedy
can be purchased’the world over, and in Australia, under the name of Bile Beans for Biliousness. This great remedy possesses the peculiar properties of acting on the
bowels without purging or otherwise weakening the patient. This is because the substance that relaxes the bowels has about the same action as the natural bile. Bile
Beans are purely vegetable, and a course of them will probably successfully oust the most chronic cases of all ailments that owe their origin to defective bile flow,
assimilation, and digestion. These Beans are placed on the market in a form that anyone can take them without medical supervision, and, as the price is so very low,
there are few homes that cannot afford to always have a box on the shelf for emergency.
Bile Beans are an Undoubted Specific for Biliousness** Sick and Nervous Headache, Indigestion, Constipation, Piles, Female Weakness, Pale-faced Girls,
Irregularities, Bad Breath, Pimples, Blotches, Dizziness, all Liver and Kidney Troubles, Dyspepsia, Heart Palpitation, Pain in Back and Side, Fulness after Eating,
Lack of Physical Tone, Heartburn, Influenza, Colds, and that Tired Feeling.

POLITICAL
POINTS
“ The Bolt from Bourke.’' The thunder-
bolt from Bourke. Mi lien beaten by nine votes.
An anti-Bartonian printer’s blunder
(Coraki, N.S.W., News): “One People, one
Density.”
The net result of N.S.W. general-election
has been to set Premier Reid’s nose to Federalist
Barton’s grindstone.
The Age evidently rejoices that Barton
was defeated at King. And why does it
rejoice? Simply because the Age, like Reid,
stayed so long on the fence.
On Sept. 15 the Reid Glovt. will make
the N.S.W. length-of-office record. Parkes once
held out for four years 15 days ; on 15th Sept.
Reid will have scored four years 16 days.
Politics and strange bedfellows ! Sydney
D.T., to bolster up its case against the Convention
Bill, actually quotes Dr. Billy Maloney and (ye
gods !) “ Stephen Barker, J.P.,” of Victoria.
Reid, the patron of six political livings—
Chairmanship of Committees, three Cabinet port-
folios and two seats on the Public Works Com-
mittee—is hungrily followed about by 50 pairs of
longing eyes.
There have been three elections in N.S.W.
on the single-electorate system. In ’94, Premier
Reid’s majority in King Division was 469; in
’95, it was 132 ; in ’9B, with a considerably larger
poll, it was 110.
E. D. Millen, candidate for Bourke, polled
exactly the same number of votes (517) at the
general elections of 1895 and 1898. That number
in ’95 represented a majority of 220 ; in ’9B, it re-
presented a minority of nine.
At N.S.W. general election, Millen, the
inflated midget who boasted that he had scared
big Barton a« ay from Bourke, couldn’t even hold
his own seat against the popular “ Baldy ” Davis,
a candidate of less than half Barton’s tonnage.
After a careful study of the 125 members
of the defunct Parliament of N.S. Wales, ex-
Treasurer M‘Millan concluded that “ only six of
them could be looked to for a rational opinion on
the commercial or industrial life of the country.”
Lots of N.S.W. electors’ rights are in
hands other than those of their lawful owners.
“Look here, Mister,” said one individual who
turned up at a polling-booth last week to do busi-
ness, “ I’ve got 23 rights. What do you say ? ”
BACK AGAIN.
“A great peace has fallen upon the. land.”
Thirty members of the. old N.S.W. Parlia-
ment haven’t returned. But the 30 who went out
included 17 Reidites and eight Oppositionists.
The 30 new men who take their places include 17
Federalists, seven Reidites, and three Indepen-
dents.
S.A. Treasurer Holder bemoans his ill-
luck. Within a week of the close of the financial
year three big estates paid probate to the extent
of £66,000, just too late to prevent the S. A.
deficit of ,£30,000 becoming a surplus to the like
amount.
Q. Premier Byrnes must first disown the
political hoggishness and quasi-criminality of the
old boodle-push, and utterly repudiate those of
his present colleagues who were in any way mixed
up with that gang, before he can hope to gain the
confidence of the public.
N.S.W. ex-Treas. M‘Millan (absent in
Europe through ill-health) was rejected for Bur-
wood in favor of local alderman Archer. The
latter had the covert support of the Reid party,
who dared not help him openly lest M'Millan’s
commercial friends should declare war against the
Premier in King. M‘Millan has the unalloyed
confidence of the Sydney business men, who will
know what they have to expect from the Reid
inner circle when, as in this ease, the Reidites
have a personal axe to grind.
The sudden death which
fell upon Copeland’s motion in
N.S.W. Assembly to have
public - houses opened for a
couple of hours on Sundays
has inspired the lemon-juice
brigade to initiate a fresh
agitation. The work of this
“ forward ” party will be to
obtain legislation to keep
city pubs, closed until after
breakfast every day of the
week. These apostles will
squelch the curse of the early
dram or give earache to the
land. Then they can argue
that their crusade is in the in-
terests of the poor barman
and barmaid, and that they
are anti-slavery as well as an-
ti-liquor.
Premier Braddon’a
reason for opposing woman
suffrage :
If a man and woman are hap-
pily married the man would have
two votes at his disposal. If
they are not happily married the
woman’s vote would be always
cast against the man’s. Thus the
unfortunate man would not have
any voting power at all. I will
be no party to depriving any un-
happily-married man of his vote.
That the man who boasted at
the Convention that “ in Tas-
mania we give a man as many
votes as he deserves ; some
men have twelve,” can voice
these sentiments, is simply
wonderful. Even the sor -
rowful Tas. Assembly in -
dulged in ironical cheers.
But Braddon was in dead
earnest.
The present Godly
N. S. W. Govt, should go
down to posterity as the Cain
Ministry, Bar Reid and
Want, there is not an
“ able ” man amongst the
lot.
“ What was the holiday on Wednesday
given for ? ” asked a suburban teacher, who endea-
vors to keep his pupils up to date. “Please, sir,”
said Billy Wool wash (a born anti-Reidite), “be-
cause o’ the general ejections.” Come to think of
it, Billy wasn't so far out.
Sydney City Council has increased its
representation in Parliament by one, the present
four being T. Jessep, Mayor Harris, Henry Chap-
man, and S. E. Lees, all of whom will carry on
the tradition for woodenness so violently inter-
rupted by Alderman John Norton.
That little milk-and-water-diluted carica-
ture of old-man Parkes, Alfred Allen, the teetotal
rhymester, was loudly rejected for Queanbeyan in
favor of O’Sullivan. The idea of Alfred Allen
representing a sinewy country constituency made
even the local porkers laugh.
Sour Grapes : Come to think of it, where’s
the especial honor of representing King Division ?
The election-bosses are mostly publicans; the
rank-and-file a.re in more or less menial positions.
Almost any Sydney suburban constituency is
much more intellectual than King.
As a salve for his defeat at the polls, and
his loss of the chance of a portfolio, “ the mothers
of Bourke ” testimonialised little Millen ! Cruel
women ! It was only the fathers of Bourke who
could have effectively testimonialised Mr. M.
They could have put him into Parliament.
The “promising” young members of Reid’s
party went down badly. A. B. Piddington,
Millen, and O’Reilly are numbered with the slain ;
Ashton is about the only survivor. It is the pro-
mise of Reid and co. that the electors object to.
They seldom get past the “ promising” stage.
Shifty old W. H. Groom seems just about
to give in his allegiance to the Byrnes Govt. Re-
marked, the other day, at a banquet to the Pre-
mier, that he didn’t know what there was to oppose
in Byrnes’ policy. Neither does anyone else, for,
as to policy, no one can detect that T. J.B. has any.
Poor, absurd, old N.S. W. Chief Secretary
Brunker (who, when asked a tough question,
evades it and says: “I always try to do what is
right ”) very narrowly escaped defeat at East
Maitland. His S.M. HERALD-made mana has
burst, and he is now awaiting the political poll-
axe.
The Senegambian hut-tax, the Maori dog-
tax, the interest on Indian public works payable
in gold—are these the cloudlets no bigger than
Brougham’s hand preluding the break-up of the
British Imperial drought ? It wouldn’t matter so
much, perhaps, but for the worse droughts to
follow.
Brisbane Courier effort to re-introduce
religious teaching into Queensland State schools is
said by an ecclesiastical observer of affairs there
to be a Machiavellian scheme to induce Premier
Byrnes to take a step towards Denominationalism
and thereby break his political neck. The Courier
has a man for his billet.
Premier Reid owes his defeat of Barton
chiefly to the police and fire-brigade vote, which
totalled about the number of the majority, 110.
The police were promised a fortnight’s annual
holiday by the man in power, and the fire-brigades
men were given to understand that a pension was
to be provided for their chief, Supt. Bear.
The most awful smash among the N.S.W.
Govt, general-election candidates was that of
Cornelius Danahey, who went up to Uralla (so
Sydney D.T. put it) to “ administer the needful
political chastisement ” to W. H. B. Piddington.
Cornelius D., with the Govt, influence behind
him, got 33 votes, while alphabetical Piddington
mustered 416, and a casual person named Brown
scored 257.
THE GREAT THIRST OF THE PEOPLE.
YARRA BANK ORATOR: “ We don’t want to educate the peoplel
We want to excite them! Now, how are we going to
excite them?”
YARRA BANK INHABITANT (in a hoarse voice) : "Give ’em Beer!”
Whether legal members of N.S.W. Leg.
Council should or should not accept Crown briefs
may be worth debate, but no more reason exists
for impugning Barton’s Parliamentary position
because of his engagement on the M'Sharry case
than there does for impugning that of Salomons,
Pilcher and others for conducting other Crown-
directed cases.
Three members of Reid’s Ministry (Smith,
Garrard and Gould) went down at the general
election —the biggest disaster of its kind that any
N.S.W. Ministry has met with for many years.
Even when the Gibbs Govt, made its famous
retreat from Moscow in ’94, all the Ministry came
back except one—E. B. Suttor. Sydney Smith
extinguished him. Now he extinguishes Smith.
It will be interesting to note how long
Sydney D.T. retains the N.S.W. Premiership.
Four years ago the position was precisely the
same, but Reid promptly threw over the paper
that fathered him, and took his cupboard-love
along to the old lady of Hunter-street. How long
before the Telegkaph is again calling No-Yes a
“ rail-sitter,” and kicking him into filial sub-
mission ?
Frank Cotton, whose yell for majority
rule in the Commonwealth has been loud and long,
takes his seat in N.S.W. Assembly for Newtown-
Cainperdown on the strength of 471 votes, although
the roll number for that electorate is 3218, and
1756 actually voted. 471 voted that he should be
member, and 1285 voted that he should not, and
the stern advocate for majority rule boasts of his
splendid victory.
Brisbane Courier :
It is imperative that the question of defence shall he
considered, because, as Mr. Byrnes says, whether we
federate or not we may have to fight.
Yes. The Queenslanders may have to fight—and
a pretty figure they'd cut, fighting on their own
account, outside the Federation. Perhaps they’ll
arm the Japs, give the kanakas rifles, and put the
Chows in the van !
The South Melb. and Emerald Hill
branches of Vic, Labor-party have nominated
rival candidates for the coming S. Melb. muni-
cipal elections. People wondered why, but now
it seems that the Orange and Green business is at
the bottom of it. Vic. Labor has come to a low
pass when it allows the pointsmen of an obscure
but malignant sectarianism to move it one inch
from its clearly visible track.
John Norton was among the lost at N.S.W.
general election, after being a M.L.A. for one
session of 16 days, during which time he was only
once fired out by the Speaker’s orders—for damn-
ing somebody. The Bulletin hopes all this will
be a lesson to John ; but, even under the circum-
stances, the return in his stead of a dullard like
the amiable Chapman is a political blasphemy, and
a satire on the aggregate human understanding.
No-Yes Reid’s most skilful trick was his
adoption of Parkes’s spider-like policy of sliming
the little parliamentarians and then swallowing
them bodily, so that the only entity, the only real
live flesh-and-blood human being, in his Ministry
is Attorney-General Want. And, although he has
lost Garrard, Gag-Gould (The Bulletin still
stutters), and Sid. Smith, Reid can easily fill their
places. The No-Yes side teems with such cattle.
Barton, Wise and R. E. O’Connor, the
Federalist champions, will all sit in N.S.W. Leg.
Assembly. The alert and accomplished Wise,
after a desperate battle, was returned for Ashfield
by five votes, to the unspeakable chagrin of his
enemies ; Mr. Pyers will retire from the Richmond
to gi ve Barton a seat, and Gunnedah will, no doubt,
ratify the proposal of Mr. Goodwin, the sitting
member, that he should retire to make room for
O’Connor.
Contrary to the N.S.W. electoral law,
which provides that half-castes, whose fathers are
unnaturalised aliens, have not the franchise, the
names of many such persons have gob on to the
rolls in Sydney and suburbs, and no doubt
throughout the country generally.
Minister Gould never made any elaborate
public defence of his action and inaction in the
Suffield case until his own Parliamentary skin
was in danger at the general election ; and then
he said, among other things, that he had acted
conscientiously all through. 'The Bulletin wasn’t
talking of conscience ; it was talking of brains and
heart. Some politicians are absolutely bursting
with conscience, while all the time they haven’t
enough sense to take the pips out of a water-
melon.
The Bulletin is satisfied with the result
of N.S.W. general-election. The Wriggle party
has straightened out ; the Cabbage-tree Parlia-
mentary gang no longer openly exists; the
Ministry returns shorn of its majority and right
under the thumb of a crowd which denies that a
citizen can be an honest Democrat unless he has
corns on his hands. Premier Reid’s mother-in-
law is the Labor-party. She weighs 19 stone, and
has come to live with him and sit right down on
his chest.
So used is Victoria to municipal rotten-
ness that she only smiles in a tired fashion when
she hears in several columns of the daily press
that a retiring municipal councillor sends in
claims and objections re ratepayers being placed
on the roll which will be used at his own election,
that he acts as counsel for or against said rate-
payers and alleged ratepayers in the revision-
court, that he is a member of and adjudicates in
said revision-court, and that he feels insulted
when his action is protested against.
Dick Meagher, the wrecked solicitor, who
was “torn asunder by conflicting emotions in a
tram,” just before he got into the famous Dean
trouble, comes back to N.S.W. Parliament with
an overwhelming majority, as member for the
Tweed, a remote northern electorate where the
story of the Dean case is probably little known.
Meagher, a loud avalanche of rhetoric, who could
talk a dog’s hind-leg straight, was, it was solemnly
alleged, going to retrieve that lamentable affair
by honest toil in a far country, but he went round
lecturing instead.
The Forrest Government shows signs of
tottering, in W. A. It attempted to add a Bible-
in-schools clause to the Education Bill, and a god-
less majority defeated it by 20 votes against 7.
Then the same evening it attempted to shelve the
Divorce Bill on the ground that divorce was a
sinful institution, and again the godless majority
won, this time by 13 votes to 10. The collapse of
the boom, and the fall in revenue, and the failure
of the new loan, and the deficit, all coming at
once, seem to have convinced Westralia that its
great Joss Forrest is only clay after all.
The Referendum Bill and the Old-Age
Pension Bill have both re-appeared in M.L. Par-
liament. And Ben Tillett has disappeared, the
parting cry of imported pessimist being that
COMERS VINE , one of the chief engineers of the
New Guinea Land-Grab.
the workers must never trust the Government, and
must always be against it, and that the Govern-
ment and the “reptile press ” are always against
the people, and always will be, and that there is
no faith in any politician whatever. Yet, if Sed-
don’s Old-Age Pension Bill gets through it will do
more good than would be effected by 100 years of
Tillett’s gospel of destruction and his Solomon
Eagle-ish cry that the worker must be ag’in every-
body.

“ N.” : A member of Melb. Benevolent

came up, “A certain class of people never die.”
May I suggest that a certain class of brutes never
die?
'Orris Tozer, at a recent London banquet,
pleaded eloquently for the appointment of a mem-
ber of the royal family as future Gov.-General of
Australasia. There is no more sickening syco-
phant in the whole realm of toadyism than your

The tick does not thrive on the broad
plains and open downs of the West. Various
theories have been propounded to account for this.
It has been attributed to the dryness of the
climate, to the exposure to heat and cold, and
several other circumstances. The latest theory is
that the ants, which are simply innumerable on
every acre of West Queensland, eat the tick-eggs,
and so check the pest. Sounds plausible.
A Melbourne civil-servant who filed his
schedule the other day (liabilities .£961, assets 55.)
gathered a strange crowd of creditors in court.
His tale was that he was ruined by the boom, and
had to borrow ,£B5O to pay a claim made on him
by the Standard Bank. It was mostly raised
from eight people, the most pathetic of the gather-
ing being a very ancient Hebrew with the snow
of 84 years on his head. This patriarch arose and
showed the Court a birthday-card which, he
alleged, was all he had received on account of a
,£5O loan. It was also stated, on the old man’s
behalf, that the transaction had reduced him to
beggary, and as it is rarely a father of the Chosen
is left absolutely a pauper through.the loss of .£5O,
the Court looked at him with interest. But while
it was studying the broken Abraham, insolvent
explained that his life had been so.hard through
continued struggles with his creditors that he
hadn’t had a new suit of clothes for five years.
Then the Court adjourned and went out to weep
silently.
The sea-snake —not the sea-serpent of
imaginative sailor-folk occasionally varies its
latitude, as the other sort varies its longitude. A
specimen was lately captured, by a fisherman, on
the E. coast of Tasmania. Usual habitat, tropical
seas, extending from the coast of Madagascar to
Panama. Thirteen of the species catalogued by
Dr. Krefft, Aust. Museum, most; of them deadly-
poisonous—enough to kill a man in four hours and
a tortoise in 50min.
Of the four Leg. Councillors who resigned
to try for seats in N.S.W. Assembly, only S. E.
Lees, an absurd political nonentity, was success-
ful. In Barton and Dick O’Connor the Council
loses the two men who did most to it from
absolute dotage. And this time Dan O Connor,
who left the bone for the shadow, has vanished
probably for ever. Daniel tried to serve two
masters. “Let us,” he said, “try to bring
together these two great souls ” (Read and
Barton).

From an Australian lady (Mrs. P. G.
Arthur) on the trail to Klondyke :
Have just ordered a short skirt of wolf fur, lined with
blanket, cost 60 dols. Also a coat, bear fur outside and
lamb fur inside ; bloomers made of sheepskin, wool out-
side. [Bryan O’Lynn knew better than this.] . . .
We are taking eight ponies. ... I fear most of all
the bears, which they say are very troublesome ; but it
is said that, with large numbers together, we shall get on
all right. We are all well armed. . . . We are waiting for
a thaw to be able to start.
The lady and her party were making for the
Teslin Lake region.
Although the sensation-mongers have been
carping at the “smallness of the penalty in-
flicted on the old woman lately fined £2 and costs
at Glebe (Sydney) police-court, for neglecting and
half-starving four children who lived with her—it
is very doubtful if citiy penalty should have been
exacted from a poor creature whom the evidence
distinctly showed to be a harmless crank with a
“ divine mission,” and who allowed herself to fare
no better than her charges. The fact that there
was neither money nor intentional cruelty in the
matter entirely differentiates the case from those
which the penal provisions of the Children’s Pro-
tection Act were intended to meet.
Ex-Minister Garrard may partially ascribe
his defeat to a foolish joke he tried to play in one of
the bye wavs of his constituency. A local sup-
porter of the late Minister, highly respected in
the district, innocently asked him a rather awk-
ward question, which funny Jacob sought to
parry by asking, “ would his friend also answer a
question?” and then propounded the ancient
wheeze: “ Have you left off beating your wife
yet?” The simple rustics, not seeing the humor
of the thing, were scandalised at the imputation
that their worthy neighbor was a wife-beater, and
the locality plumped for young O’Conor in re-
venge.
The Maorilaud Government’s programme
for the new session includes old age pensions ;
the Referendum; the Second Ballot, or some
similar device to prevent minorities returning
members to Parliament; and the abolition of the
life-members in M.L. Upper House. In ’9l the
M.L. Council was so far reformed that all mem-
bers appointed since then hold office for seven
years only. But it was found necessary to. bribe
the existing fossils to pass the Reform Bill by
leaving them in for life, and since then the country
has been patiently waiting for these ancient sur-
vivors to peg out. Last year there were still
28 life-members out of 47, and it began to be felt
that the old gentlemen were not dying out fast
enough. Also, it is found that a seven years
nominee, towards the end of his term, may have
grown almost as tough as a life-member.

AUTION.
A WORD OF CAUTION to buyers should be offered.
In buying a Bicycle, as in buying anything requiring
supreme skill to produce the highest and most endur-
ing results, remember that the influence of the mass
of makers and agents is enlisted against the leading article of its kind, and
that inducements other than the intrinsic merits of the goods themselves are
fullv used to force the sale of a cheaper line. “Under the best apple-tree are found
the'most sticks and stones.” It makes us smile to hear the pitiful stones circulated by
our friends (?) in the trade, to injure the standing and reputation of RED BIRD Cycles.
Cyclists of common sense are not led astray by false yarns circulated by dealers, one
wav to judge a C3 r cle is by its sales. If it sells well against competition, it must be
good. If it doesn’t sell well, it isn’t worth considering. More Red Bird Special,
Red Bird No. 1, and Black Bird Cycles are sold than any three makes put
together in Australia. This says something. Why not send for list of New Models t

SPORTING NOTIONS.
At Brighton (Sydney), last week, the Yan Cleve
eeldino- Fritz, bred, and driven by Mr. J. A. Buck-
land, cut down the Australian trotting-record to *2.14,
beating his own previous best by %sec. When it is con-
sidered the record was made on a track a shade less than
half-a-mile in circumference, comparatively soft and
bumpy, and on the turn the whole way, it is hard to say
what the champion would cut the mile out in on a good
kite-shaped track, such as American records are made
upon. Mr. Buckland said Fritz had trotted for him, in
private, a quarter in 31hjjsec., and half in 1.3.
Mr. Buckland is willing to match Fritz against
any horse in the world for a substantial stake, but as he
says he will not go to America the challenge might as
well be sponged out. For it is quite unlikely that any
American owner would bring a valuable horse to Aus-
tralia for one match, risking the trip across and climatio
troubles when he got here. Fritz is without doubt a
freak of nature. He knows but one pace, the trot, and
he does not know what a break means, whilst, unfortu-
nately, the majority of Van Cleve’s get are only too fond
of breaking, as Mr. Buckland finds to his cost. Had
Fritz been foaled upon American soil, and fallen into the
best hands, it would not be even too great a flight of
fancy to think of him performing the feat which every
American horsemen lives in the hopes of one day seeing
—a mile trotted in 2min.

Zeno 11. being most fancied for the Epsom. Charge,
Loch Leigh, The Tola, and Feu-de-joie appear fairly well
treated in the mile sprint, while Fucile, if well, should
be capable of annexing the Metrop. The next best seem
to be Charge and Toreador.

Mr. “ Admiral ” Cook has Reka in such good
plight that, if he sends him across the border, it is on the
cards that the N.S.W. cast-off may account for either
Epsom or Metrop., in each of which races he is very fairly
treated.

Sydney D.T.’s sporting scribe deserves support
in his straight-out remarks on the remarkable running of
certain Sydney ponies. He has been rather late in start-
ing, but not too late to still do good. One case of wonder-
ful improvement drawn attention to was that of Howlong,
who, though beaten badly at Moorefield with 8.3 up,
cantered away with the Handicap at Canterbury where
he met a much better field, and carried 61b. more weight.

First acceptances for V.A.T.C. G.N. “Steeple”
and “Hurdles” have provoked much wagering in Mel-
bourne and Sydney. His Grace, with the thumping im-
post of 12st. 51b., rules as first favorite for the Hurdles ;
but, when it is all over, it may be found that Realgar
(lOst. lib.) and So-and-So (list.) are the best able to
negotiate the stiff 3J4 miles. The Steeple may fall to
Doondiah (list. 51b.), or Dr. M'Kinnon (lOst. 41b.), both
of which are capable of staying-out the severe 4 miles.

Bulletin remarks on the running of the Carbine
colt, Lee Metford, at Flemington G.N. meeting, were
borne out by the result at Caulfield a fortnight later.
“ Sporting Notions,” of July 16th, said : “ The lad aboard
the sluggish favorite couldn’t get him going until the
leaders were nearly home. Lee Metford finished fourth,
several lengths behind Bushy Park.” In the Caulfield
race, Lee Metford was left several lengths at the start,
but, this time, the boy did get him going, and he won
easily. It was now Bushy Park’s turn to finish several
lengths behind. Such is the gloriously-uncertain game
of racing.

Iron Duke, although he started at 6 to 1 for the
Hurdle Race at Caulfield t’other Saturday, was a very
strong whisper among a section of the Melb. “ talent.”
But it takes the average local punter a long time to catch
on to a “ good thing” from Sydney.

Ballarat trainers seem to cling to some of their
old, non-productive ’osses with a fine, durable faith.
Soobie has Dreamland entered for the Cups again this
year, and the other day Alec. Taylor turned up at Caul-
field with Alpine, and they backed the infirm veteran
down to 4 to 1 for the principal race of the day. He
didn't get near winning. Alpine, as far as writer can
remember, has never had but one win—a “ maiden ” race
at Flemingion, long years ago. Most of the time since
then he has been engaged in getting into condition pre-
vious to breaking down again on one or more legs. As a
sound horse Alpine might have done great things, of
course, but up to now he has been as bad a failure as there
is in the Racing Chronicle.

Auraria— probably the best 3-year-old mare that
Australia has known, is to be put this season to W. R.
Wilson’s imported stallion, Bill of Portland. She was
entered for Melb. Cup, and the handicapper had let her
in at 9st. The real original Aurarja, who beat Hova for
the Cup in ’95, and afterwards ran the famous dead-heat
with Wallace with 9st. on her 6-year-old-back, would have
been a lot more than a 2 to 1 chance.

Dear Bulletin. —Aren’t you getting tired of
Australian excuses for Newhaven’s running in England?
The excuse for his failure in the Ascot Gold Vase race is—
the jockey. Horse couldn’t get his head, and so forth.
This looks the more absurd, seeing that Newhaven, on
the occasion of his second defeat by Bay Ronald, proved
himself better than Merman, who was at the top of the
tree in this country. Merman has won important races
at ’Ome. He runs up to form, anyhow. And if New-
haven can beat his compatriot on English ground, the
inference is that he likewise has shown them his best
going. There is really no reason to suppose that New-
haven was at any time vastly superior to Merman. The
book now shows that the sensational Derby and Cup
winner had “ nothing to beat ” during his triumphant
Australian season. True, he carried a big weight for a
youngster, and won the Cup in very fast time. But the
time-test in racing is unreliable. It was fast in New-
haven’s time because he ran in front of the field, going
his hardest without any interference, and he was able to
bolt away with the stake simply because the horses
behind him were commoners, with the exception of
Resolute, who suffered from very bad feet. In England
he will do the same thing whenever he meets second-rate
animals. - Ostler Joe.

Government audit of the books of the consulta-
tion boss is an institution worthy of every encourage-
ment. It discloses to the public where some of its
money doesn’t go, and is calculated to excite the righteous
acquisitiveness of treasurers on the look-out for fresh
revenue sources. Tas. Auditor-General, in certifying
that Tatt.’s Consultation business in Hobart is run on fair
and honest lines, mentions the fact that in 18 months
the unclaimed prizes amount to nearly £13,000. As the
ijightful owners of the prizes have probably “ stepped
outside,” and as not one per cent, of them are likely to
put in a claim, the State should take charge of the money
as it already takes charge of the swag and billy of the
unidentifiable prospector who dies out in the Never-
Never. The unclaimed bank-balances, sweep-prizes and
other assets of Australia’s Great Lost Legion would, if
carefully collected by Govt., go some way towards the
much-needed Public Works Fund. If the first Federal
Treasurer knows his business he will make an enthusiastic
grab in this direction.
Editor Bulletin. —“A suggestion.” Re the
proposal that “ Tattersall’s ” sweeps should be drawn on
the day of the race, I would suggest that “ Tatt.” take a
referendum on the matter, thus : “ Are you in favor of
sweeps being drawn on the day of the race? Yes—No.”
These slips could be sent to each of his patrons when
mailing tickets. —Rockvale.

A far Northern horse-dealer lately repented of
his nefarious bargaining, and sought Heavenly forgive-
ness per medium of the Salvarmy. On the night of his
conversion, he recounted many of his little swindles, and,
flushed with penitence, said that he would be glad to
square things with anyone who had lost by his sharp
practices. It was scarcely daylight next morning when
a neighbor, who considered he had been roasted in a deal
with the newly-converted one, knocked at the latter’s
dcor, remarking that he had “ come early, to avoid the
rush.”

A member of a Northern corps of the Australian
Horse is a fine specimen of the “Geebung” polo-player.
He plays on any horse he happens to be riding, and
doesn’t even trouble to train them “ wheeling cattle in
the scrub.” Recently, while breaking a half-broken mare
into the game she fell and lay on her side with her rider
still in the saddle and with one leg under her. As the
warrior made no move to get off, the other players sang
out to him to shift or he’d get his leg broken. “Oh !
she’ll get up all right,” he answered, coolly, digging her
with the spur with his free leg—“ Gerrup ! ” And he
stopped there until she scrambled up, when he went on
with the game.

The return football-match—Queensland v. New
South Wales—drew some 9000 people to Sydney Cricket
Ground last Saturday. There was nothing between the
teams, first one side and then the other getting the best
of it, and at half-time the game stood —Queensland, 7;
N.S.W., 5. Both sides scored 11 in the second half,
leaving the visitors victors by a couple of points.

S.A. Cricket Association lately received a
memorial signed by leading local cricketers urging the
Association to secede from the Cricket Council, but by a
small majority it was decided to hold on to that body.
To Adelaideans the alternativ e of allowing the wealthy
Melb. C.C. to control Australian cricket seems like jump-
ing from the frying-pan into the fire.
B ** * * *
S.A. cricketers, led by Joe Darling, Giffen, and
Lyons, recently held a lively meeting in advocacy of the
abolition of the Cricket Council. Darling hinted that
unless the next Australian team were allowed to select
its own manager, several of the leading players would
not go. A suggested remedy is the direct representation
of players on the Council.
* • * •
The Cricket Council, if it persists in its en-
deavor to boss the next Australian team to England, will
go dangerously near committing suicide. The Council
meddled with the last team with the result that Hill and
Kelly were omitted from its selection, and inoluded by
the other players without consulting the Council. The
only thing that keeps that body alive is the alternative
possibility of the wealthy Melb. C.C. bossing Australian
cricket in the same way as the Marylebone club does in
England.
English cricket appears to be going back, rather
than standing still, this season. Batting figures up to the
20th June suggest that none of the new bowlers are worth
talking about." Arthur Shrewsbury, who brought a team
to Australia 14 years ago, heads the list with an average
of 79 per innings, and our long young friend Mason comes
next with 58-50. We might think that Mason had im-
proved in nerve and play —but Shrewsbury !He is nearer
40 than 30, and was a sick man for two or three seasons,
so, if he can come out this year and make “ centuries ”
as easy as shelling peas, the natural inference is that
English bowlers are not up to the form of years ago.
Reliable Hearne is once again the best of the bunch,
seemingly.
If no bright young performers pop up suddenly
at ’Ome within the coming 12 months the next Australian
Eleven should fairly whop the All Englanders on their
native heath. On the other hand, there is the proba-
bility that a few new county lads will come into the game
wfth a rush. The long drought in cricket will be followed
by a flood of talent, perhaps, and the Australians may
find themselves beaten—as the Britishers in Australia
have been beaten —by the novelty of the men who tackle
them in the big matches. Anyhow, it is early to pro-
phesy.

body’s pills. He has long been a splendid example (in

Cyclist White, of overlanding notoriety, is the
hero of the following story. At a country pub., not far
from Gympie, sundry bagmen were sitting at table, one
evening, cursing the toughness of the mutton and exe-
crating the fine, full, antediluvian flavor of the butter.
Along came the overlander, fired with the furious appe-
tite of a man who has been all day on the wheel, sat down
at the table, and demolished everything before him—
butter included. . . . Then the bagmen arose quietly, got
up a subscription, and presented the wheelman with a
neat little testimonial —and thanked God that that butter
was gone.

At a recent cycling “contest ” there was a big
field and a lot of public money ventured. A, B, and 0
were able to command the winner, and the state of the
odds made it desirable that A should come in first, so a
syndicate headed by the three was formed accordingly.
A got in first all right and the pot was to all appearances
landed. B, however, went in for putting too much
finish and frill on the swindle ; just for the look of things
he lodged what he thought was an utterly hopeless protest
against A for jostling. To the disgust of the combination
the protest was allowed and A disqualified for a term. A
dead certainty had been fixed up for A on the following’
day; so the whole of the arrangements were upset and
the money got divided amongst the outside public, all
through B paying too much attention to the look of
things.

Landseer, “father” of S.A. Assembly, told

on Bowman’s ostrich farm, the other day, 20 young birds
were killed by them. Seven foxes were shot in one after-

The performance of the Yic. riflemen at Bisley
two years in succession indicates that they are distinctly
better than the Canadians and other visiting teams. It
also goes to show that the .-.hooting for the Kolapore Cup
is not a fair test of the “ mother-country ” strength.
Last year Vic. won the Cup, with a team of Maorilanders
second. This year eight shootists from little Guernsey
took the prize, with Vic. second. But each year the com-
petition for the valuable Queen’s Prize has brought out a
lot of “mother-country” marksmen who could give
many points to the Kolapore representative shooters.
The Victorians, however, are plainly in advance of the
ordinary British target shot, otherwise the betting would
be about 25 to 1 against even one member of the team
getting into the last stage of the Queen’s Prize. This
year two (last year one) of them achieved the distinction,
and Mr. Fargher finished sixteenth in the struggle—
which means, no doubt, that he was one of several six-
teenthers.

Important Announcement with regard to “ THE AUSTRAL WHEEL RACE.”
ADDITIONAL PRIZE MONEY.
The Austral Wheel Race is to be run on the 26th of November and the 3rd and 12th of December on the Melbourne Cricket Ground, upon the same
unbanked grass track as was used last year. As it seems likely that there will be more riders than ever this year, the Committee of Management have decided
to limit the number of riders in each heat. There will, therefore, be a greater number of heats than last year, and the riders m the final will have run greater
The Austral Cycle Agencv Ltd. have therefore decided that the winner shall be rewarded by an additional <£loo to the prize already offered, making
The Austral Cycle Agency are convinced that on such a dangerous track it is of the first importance for riders to be mounted on Machines of the
very highest grade, and they believe that if low grade Machines were excluded by the Executive many accidents would be avoided. Math a view, therefore, to
encourage competitors to provide themselves with the best possible mounts, and so lessen their own risk and the risks of those competing with them, they make
the additional £lOO conditional upon the winner riding a “ SWIFT ” Machine fitted with Dunlop Tyres.
This Machine as ridden by Walne, Parsons, and others, has proved itself unequalled for speed, style, strength, and safety, and, as these four qualities
are essential to the success of the machine used by the winner of the Austral Wheel Race, it is obvious that the condition imposed by the Austral Cycle Agency
is rather advantageous than otherwise. „ . . „,, .. 0 WTX nm » a -txt t? a :

A Great Sufferer from General

‘ Some two years ago I was suffering from
general debility, weakness, etc., and was so
ill that 1 thought I never would be well again.
I had the advice of two medical men and took
much medicine, but I derived no good what-
ever. My husband was telling a friend how
very ill I was and this friend told him to get
for me
Ayer’s Sarsaparilla
He did so and I took three bottles. I felt a
great deal better. I continued taking it and
in all I took eight bottles and was able to
resume my household duties as well as I ever
was. I feel sure that Ayer’s Sarsaparilla was-
the means of saving my life. I strongly re
commend it to anyone who is suffering as 1
did and if they will only persevere in its use 1
feel positive it will cure them.”
For constipation take Dr. Ayer's Pills. They
promptly relieve and surely cure. Take them

monses. ’ Marriage is apparently another luxury
to be reserved for Fat Man.
A Jap. on the Torres’ Straits pearling-
etation begged from the manager a book on
boat-building. The little brown man could
not read English, but he studied the diagrams
and began to build accordingly. Soon he drove
the English boat-builders out of the place. A
Japanese comp, single handed sets up the whole
of the matter of the Torres Straits Pilot. Also,
the Chinese cry against Jap. competition is again
heard in the North and, if things go on much
longer, even the white man will have to howl, too.
Cheerful marine incident elicited in a
recent Port Melh. ship-deserting ease :
He did not go back because there had been trouble on
the vessel. A man left the ship when she was on the
Line. Two men put him on a raft and sent him adrift.
That morning the seaman Chamberlin said to him,
t renchy has gone.” The man was a Frenchman, and
was put overboard by two men in the forecastle.
A “ trifle light as air,” apparently.

A British ex-naval officer to The Bulletin :
About 16 years ago two of the then best Spanish iron-
clads (the Numantia and Vittoria) mutinied in favor of
the insurgents then in arms, and started a Mediterranean
cruise “on their own.” Internationally they were, of
course, “ pirates,” and as the Spanish Govt, had no means
of dealing with them, the British admiral was asked to
take on the job. He despatched two vessels on the duty,
which was accomplished with no bloodshed to speak of.
After the Numantia had been taken in tow, the British
prize crew proceeded to unload her 81 and 12-ton muzzle-
loaders, a simple-enough operation usually. A 3-clawed
extractor is slid down the rifling, and by hooking' into
three slots on the head of the shell enables it to be with-
drawn, after which the powder is “wormed” out. But
this time the guns could not be unloaded, because the
Spanish gunners had rammed the shells home head-first 1
What sort of a picnic would have followed the firing of
the guns this fashion it’s hard —or not hard - to imagine.
According to an American paper, it is now
pretty well established that George Washington
oould carry about as much liquor as any of his
esteemed contemporaries, was irascible, impetu-
ous, and very profane. Was, like nearly all the
fathers of the republic, a Deist, repudiating the
dogma of a virgin-born God. The Bulletin
never did understand how George could run an
army on the meek-and-mild way of doing things.

Out on the Hoofs of Hell,
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
Sing us a song in tliis cynical age,
Sing us a song, my friend,
While the Flesh and the Devil are all the rage
And Death seems tlie only end.
Give it the clatter of hoof-clipped bones
And a note like a dingo’s yell,
And the long, low sigh when the big mob moans
Out on the roofs of hell.
For Wool, Tallow and Hides and co.,
For Wool, Tallow and Hides—
Over the roofs of hell we go
For Wool, Tallow and Hides.
We take the route or we take the track,
Hell-doomed by the greed of man,
And we leave our wives in the scrubs out-back
To struggle as best they can.
For the credit is short and the flour is low—
And this is the tale we tell—
A check must be made and the stock must go
Over the roofs of hell.
Wake ere the burst of the great white sun
Into the blazing skies,
Our limbs are stiff arid the lids are gummed
Over our blighted eyes.
But our souls have perished in dust and heat,
And this is the tale we tell —-
Our lives are ever a grim retreat
With Death on the roofs of hell.
They drivel and say how the bushman drinks,
But what do the townsfolk know ?
The life is a hell to the man who thinks—
He must drink or his reason go.
Drink and drink, as the bushman knows,
Till he strip to the skin and yell;
Down for a change ! for a rest ! he goes
Down through the roofs of hell.
For Wool, Tallow, and Hides and Co.,
For Wool, Tallow, and Hides,
Down through the roofs of hell they go
For Wool, Tallow, and Hides.

A Wonderful Cure.
Herr Rassmussen.
Dear Sir. —In the year 1871 I contracted rheumatism
and stiffness in the joints, and have tried all advertised
medicines. When I came to Sydney I had a great diffi-
culty in walking. Passing your window, I saw a testi-
monial from Mr. E. W. O'Sullivan, M.P., with the same
complaint as I had, which led me to try your Remedies.
On Thursday before Good Friday I took the first of your
Pills, and I am now, with the blessing of God, as well in
health as I was 23 years ago. May you long be spared
under God to be a blessing to suffering humanity.—l re-
main, Dear Sir, yours very gratefully,
JOHN KEAY.

HERR RASSMUSSEN’S
PRCSS : OPINIONS
REFERRING TO
The Wonderful Virtues
OF HIS FAR-FAMED
Alfaline Herbal Remedies.
Sydney Bulletin. —“ Herr Rassmussen’s well-known
Herbal Remedies have been the means of performing'
many great cures, which his numerous testimonials will
prove.”
Evening News, Sydney.—“ Herr Rassmussen has
shown us some highly complimentary testimonials, certi-
fying to important cures effected by his remedies.”
N.Z. Times, Wellington,—“ Herr Rassmussen manu-
factures some excellent Blood and Nerve Remedies.’
Daily Telegraph, Launceston, Tas.—“Herr Rass-
mussen is a clever botanist.”
S. A. Register, Adelaide, S.A.—“ Herr Rassmussen’s
Press notices agree as to the skill he possesses as a
botanist, and the bona fide s of his testimonials appear to
be well established.”
Cooktown Courier, Queensland. —“Herr Rasmus-
sen, we are glad to say, holds the highest place in the
colonies as a botanist, and enjoys the confidence of many
leading people of New South Wales, Victoria, and Queens-
land, and the remaining colonies.”
Evening Journal, Adelaide.—“ Herr Rassmussen
has achieved a high reputation for his skill in manufac-
turing botanic remedies.”
Sydney Truth. —“Herr Rasmussen is sufficiently well
known not to require any additional praise from Truth.
His remedies are simply wonderful.”
Sunday Times, Sydney. “ It may not be out of
place to mention that Herr Rassmussen has now been be-
fore the public for over thirteen years.”
N.Z. Mail, Wellington.—“ We have among us at the
present time one of Australia’s foremost botanists, viz.,
Herr Rassmussen, the celebrated Danish botanist, of
Sydney.”
Australian Star, Sydney.—“ Herr Rassmussen is a
gentleman who has gained for himself a reputation in the
medical world of herbal science, and his name has become
known throughout New South Wales and Australia.”
HERB RASMUSSEN’S
mission in the Herbal |||orld.
Herr Rasmussen has devoted his whole life to
the study of medical herbs and manufacture of
Herbal remedies, and his great mission has been
most wonderfully successful.
The great virtues of the Herr Rasmussen’s Alfa-
line Herbal Remedies are so well known that it is
quite unnecessary to say much in regard to them ;
the very fact of their having been before the pub-
lic for so many years, and continually growing in
popularity, is quite sufficient evidence that they
are all they are claimed to be. Taking into con-
sideration'the fact that they have been awarded
the Parisian Gold Medal, and that so many thou-
sands of original and unsolicited testimonials have
been received, and maybe seen at the Head Office,
some of which appear in his pamphlets, there
should be no difficulty in predicting a great future
for these health-giving Remedies unprecedented in
the History of Herbal Remedies.
Herbal Remedies are gradually pushing their
way forward, entirely taking the place of those
remedies which contain mercury, arsenic or strych-
nine.
The Australian press has fully recognised the
noble mission of Herr Rassmussen, and praise
bestowed upon him from this important source has
not only been most whole-hearted, but also very
generous. Space will not permit to repeat one-
tenth of his best press notices, but few will suffice
to show the public the estimation in which Herr
Rassmussen is held by the Australian press.
It is not unreasonable to ask, “Is it possible
such success should follow unless these well-known
Herbal Remedies are all they are claimed to be,
and is it likely that their popularity should keep
growing to such an extent, unless they contained
exceptional virtues out of the common ? ” The
evidence that Herr Rassmussen’s Herbal Remedies
contain wonderful virtues is simply overwhelming,
as he possesses thousands of testimonials to that
effect.

Dr. TARRANT,
E.R.C.S.E., L.R.0.P.E., L.R.0.5.1., L.M.E.0.P.E.,
i
bxc
Is a legally-qualified PHYSICIAN and SURGEON,
and is duly registered by the
New South Wales Government
Medical Board. Founder of and Chief Surgeon to
the Clarmont Private Hospital, and for
Sixteen Years Hon. Surgeon to the Sydney
Hospital. Dr. Tarrant has, during his recent
world-wide travels, discovered a
New Method of Healing.
This mode of treatment is absolutely free from
Mercury, and other deleterious, poisonous, or en-
slaving ingredients, may be stopped at any time,
need not be continued after a cure is effected, and
is unlike any other formulae formerly in use, and is
known to Dr. Tarrant alone. Hypodermic medica-
tion is limited to a few remedies, and is applicable
to a few diseases only. The administration of
drugs through the stomach is also limited by the
danger of injury to the organs of digestion.
This New Method of
Treatment
on the contrary, promotes digestion, clears the
Liver and Kidneys, thus paving the way to Perfect
health.
Many sufferers fear lest others should know they
are afflicted. I may assure those who confide their
secret to me that there is not the slightest risk of
exposure, and all letters are regarded as positively
confidential, and are destroyed by fire as soon
as answered, and all appliances are sent securely
sealed.
Dr. Tarrant’s Knowledge of
Special Complaints
from any cause arising, whether hereditary or
acquired, was gained by careful study and observa-
tion in the principal Hospitals of the world. Hr. TARRA NT makes it a special point to eradicate thoroughly
and pleasantly every trace of disease from the system, ensuring not only permanent restoration to health,
but immunity to offspring from hereditary taint.
No man will accomplish a noble purpose, become eminent, or achieve greatness, whose nervous
svstem is deranged.
No Mian ox* Woman.
should marry without first assuring themselves that they are in perfect health. If you are unable to under-
stand your malady, or if it is your intention to marry, send for Dr. TARRRANT S exhaustive work,
“ FUNCTIONAL DERANGEMENTS.”
Price Sixpence in Stamps, which contains 164 pages, blocked in gold, including numerous Prescriptions,
Illustrations and Pictures ; it will enable you to understand and describe your case. Sufferers from Special
Complaints should consult Dr. TARRANT, who has by profound research thoroughly investigated their
origin, traced Rieir deadly sources and insidious dissemination, and ascertained the surest and safest method
of eradication.
Dr TARRANT is frequently consulted by patients who have been erroneously treated for Indigestion,
Liver Complaint, Bright’s Disease, Consumption, and other complaints, whose cases prove to be over-strained
nerves Many who have thus been experimented upon, fear to consult even a physician so well-known and
universally respected as Dr. Tarrant, who has cured thousands, who have been thus mistreated, by advice
alone. Therefore, if you are a sufferer, write to the doctor, who will-, on receipt of your letter, reply cour-
teously and confidentially, naming your malady and cure., You should consult Dr. TARRANT if
you experience
Dangerous Symptoms,
Foul Breath, Indigestion, Palpitation, Blushing, Shortness of Breath, Impaired Memory, Weak, Sore, Sunken,
or Dark-circled Eyes ; Sallow or Pimply Skin, Dullness of Intellect, Piles, Constipation, or Relaxation of the
Bowels ' Bad Taste, Wind, Desire for Solitude or Drink, Bashfulness, Weak Back, Bad Feet, Oozing of Saliva
from the mouth during sleep, Neuralgia, Hacking Cough, Giddiness. Fear of Insanity or Suicide, Inclination
to Throw Yourself Down when over water. Inability to keep your Thoughts off Impure Subjects, Dreams,
Twitching of the Eyelids, Numbness, or Prickly Sensation, Timidity, Fear of Impending Danger, &c. Dr.
Tarrant makes
Absolutely HXTo Charge
for Consultation ; but as One Pound is all that is necessary to send for the treatment of almost any com-
plaint including Special Complaints, Skiu Diseases, Liver Troubles, Gravel, Scrofula, Throat, Eye and Ear
Complaints, Fistula, Piles, Paralysis, Sciatica, Rheumatism, Dengue Fever, Diseases of Women, Constipa-
tion, Hip Disease, Dropsy, Worms, Epilepsy (Fits), Bright’s Disease, Influenza, Lung Troubles, Coughs,
Neuralgia, and other complaints too numerous to mention, you should, to avoid delay, enclose that amount
in vour first letter, thus proving bona fides, and consequently ensuring immediate attention. Should Dr.
TARRANT decide that he cannot warrant a cure, or that your malady may be cured by advice alone, the
One Pound will be returned to you.
Patients, male or female, living at a distance may, if desired, without unnecessary expense be accommo-
dated at Dr. TARRANT’S Private Hospital, and nursed back to health by carefully-trained nui#es, under
the guidance of Dr. TARRANT.
If you are ill, be you young or old, male or female, either call or write in perfect confidence to Dr.
TARRANT, who will give your case prompt, courteous, careful, and confidential consideration, and impart
his diagnosis in plain understandable language.

One day six years ago the usual presenta-
tion was made to a departing bank-manager in.a
town in the Northern Territory of Eastern Fiji,
and things went smoothly on the surface,
but behind the scenes there was chaos and gnash-
ing of teeth. The banker owed a large bill to the
publican, and couldn't pay ; his impecuniosity
was so well-known that the idea of extracting com
from him was a glaring absurdity. Also, the local
public didn’t take kindly at first to the idea of a
cash testimonial. But the publican called in his
friend, the local M.P., who was intensely popu-
lar but twice as impecunious as the manager him-
self ; and, as the member had a valuable political
supporter in the publican, he agreed to certain
propositions that were laid before him. The
manager also agreed. The terms were that
the member was to head the list with
a purely bogus subscription of -6100. With
this to start the ball rolling the publican reckoned
that £lOO in real cash could be raised, and out
of this his bill of .£4O was to be. liquidated, and
the member was to get a loan —it was delicately
put that way—of £lO in return for the use of his
name. This would leave the manager £5O to the
good, and that was at least something.. The £lOO
of subscriptions were raised as anticipated, and
all would have been well, only the banker
“ turned dorg” at the last moment. The presen-
tation was made publicly, the drink-merchant
handing over a list showing £2OO subscribed ;
also a purse containing £lOO in sovereigns. Then
he turned pale green with rage as the perfidious
recipient deliberately shook out the sovereigns
and counted them out on the table. “ Gentle-
men,” said the financier as he gathered up the
money, “ the list, as you observe, shows £2OO
subscribed, including our honored member’s dona-
tion of £lOO. I have here £lOO in sovereigns.
As an explanation of this discrepancy I
may mention that I have handed our
honored member’s cheque to our dear friend and
esteemed fellow-townsman, Mr. Public-House,
here present. After he has deducted from it a
sum of £4O, which I owe him, I have instructed
that the balance shall be handed to the local
hospital.” Then he shook hands with every one
and left. The publican’s account is still un-
settled, and as he didn’t pay over the alleged £6O
balance out of the member’s alleged £lOO the
local hospital now accuses him of embezzlement,
and doesn’t drink on his premises any more. But
the surprising fact that he was rich, enough to
subscribe £lOO in one lump to a testimonial has
improved the member’s credit a great deal, and he
is doing better than usual just now, and nobody
is really badly left except the publican.. And it
is no good for him to try to explain things that
are too complicated for explanation.

THREE ATTACKS OF INFLUENZA.
“ THE PAIN I SUFFERED BEATS
DESCRIPTION.”
“ Until a short time ago I had not known for
40 years what permanent relief from pain was.”
Thus spoke Mrs. T. J. Thomas, of Heathcote,
Victoria, recently to a reporter. How greatly
Mrs. Thomas suffered from rheumatism, repeated
attacks of influenza, enlargement of the liver, and
inflammation of the kidneys is vividly shown by
nnrwwi
her remarks. “ I am
over 74 years of age,”
she continued. “It
was, as near as I can
remember, in "57 that
I had my first at-
tack of rheumatism,
and these have fol-
lowed me up, on and
off, for 40 years.
About nine years
ago my troubles were
added to by enlarge-
ment of the liver,
and this in itself,
more than sufficient
to kill most people
of my age, was ag-
gravated by inflam-
mation of the kid-
neys. As you may
imagine, I was in a
very critical condi-
THE PAIN I SUFFERED BEATS
DESCRIPTION. ”
tion for a long time, and when just about to
pull together again another severe attack of
rheumatism brought me down. This brings
me to about five years back, when I caught
influenza the first time. But to shorten my
story, I had further attacks of rheumatism
and influenza again the following year, and
though the influenza missed me for the next two
years, rheumatism did not. But I had more to
face yet, for about a year and nine months I was
laid up with a third attack of influenza. I never
seemed to be able to throw this off as I had the
others, and it made me feel terribly low-spirited.
My oldest enemy, rheumatism, kept going at me,
and it seemed that between them they were going
to get the better of me. I had four or five
doctors, but their advice and physic was not the
least bit of good, and I just felt I could not last
much longer. The pain I suffered beats descrip-
tion. I could not lie down, and the only position
in which partial relief was to be found was sitting,
bearing to one side. I could not bear anything to
touch my back. I don’t like to think of the tor-
ture through which I have passed ; it was terrible.
I lost all power in my legs. At this stage my
attention was attracted to some of the pub-
lished cures, which had been affected by Dr.
Williams’ Pink Pills for Pale People, of cases
which, had been pronounced by doctors and hos-
pitals as hopeless, and I determined to make a
trial of them. This was in the early part of
April, and I was feeling about as bad as I had
ever felt. By the time the third box was taken a
marked improvement was noticeable, and this
happy alteration continued until I was at the
twelfth box, quite enabled to discontinue the
treatment. My friends and acquaintances were
astonished at my recovery, and quite a number
are taking the pills, and others have expressed
their determination to do so should they ever feel
the need of treatment.”

HOW TO OBTAIN A ROSY COMPLEXION.
What ean be more distressing than to see a girl
drooping and fading in the springtime of youth.
Instead of bright eyes, glowing, rosy cheeks, and
an elastic step, there are dull eyes, pale, yellow, or
greenish complexion, and a languidness of step
that bespeaks disease and an early death if proper
treatment is not promptly resorted to and per-
sisted in until the impoverished blood is enriched,
and the functions of life become regular.
Upon parents rests a great responsibility at
the time their daughters are budding into
womanhood. If your daughter is pale, com-
plains of weakness, is “tired out” upon the
slightest exertion; if she is troubled with head-
ache or backache, pain in the side, if her temper is
fitful and her appetite.poor, she is in a condition
of extreme peril, a fit subject for the development
for the mosthreaded of all diseases —Consumption.
If you notice any of the above symptoms, lose no
time in procuring Dr. Williams’ Pink Pills. They
will assist the patient to develop properly and
regularly ; they will enrich the blood and restore
health’s roses to the cheeks; bright eyes and
lightness of step will surely follow their use, and
all danger of consumption and premature death
will bs averted. - -
Neuralgia.
HOW TWELVE YEARS’ SUFFERINGS
WERE ENDED.
There is a neat and natty grocery store at the
corner of Rathdown and Palmerston streets, Mel-
bourne, when one can always drop in for an
interesting chat with the proprietoress, Mrs.
Margaret Ross, who assists her husband in man-
aging the business. The theme upon which the
conversation frequently turns is the marvellous
recovery from neuralgia which Mrs. Ross has ex-
perienced through using Dr. Williams’ Pink Pills
for Pale People. A reporter dropped in at the
store recently, and to him Mrs. Ross very kindly
narrated her experience.
“ I have been a great sufferer from neuralgia for
ten or twelve years,” she said, “but nothing re-
lieved me except Dr. Williams’ Pink Pills for
Pale People, which alone have effected a cure.
All changes of season proved futile to arrest my
malady. During the daytime my sufferings were
painful, but on retiring to rest, the agony I
■suffered was excruciating, reducing me to a state
of general collapse. I felt it during the day
slightly, but most severely at night.”
“ Did you consult any doctors at all ? ”
“ Many; but received no permanent benefit.
They gave me draughts and powders, but the
effect was really nothing.”
“ You, of course, have tried other remedies ? ”
“ Yes: I tried everything, but obtained no
relief.”
“ What induced you to try Dr. Williams’ Pink
Pills for Pale People 1 ”
Influenza.
A WONDERFUL SYDNEY CURE.
“Influenza,” said Mr. Tate, of “Ithica Cot-
tage,” Illawarra Road, Marriekville, “ was the
malady with which I had to struggle. Of course,
I didn’t want to neglect my work, so I went in

usual—not by a long-
bit. Prior to this 1

sickness at any time

thirty years’ immu-
nity from trouble, in-
fluenza gripped me,
and it gripped me
pretty tight. With-
out warning, I sud-
denly became ill.
I always had a first-
class appetite ; it left
me altogether. Posi-
tively I could eat nothing at all. Heavy headaches
attacked me, and they continued to increase in
violence; a spasm shot across my chest, and an
overpowering weight oppressed me there ; I felt a
sickening contraction of the skin and an ominous
gathering of phlegmatic matter that checked free

WILLIAMS’
“An elderly lady, resident at Heathcote, 74
years of age, who had been a sufferer from rheu-
matist for 40 years, and who had been absolutely
cured by their use, recommended me to try the
Dr. Williams’ Pink Pills for Pale People.”
“ How long since might that be ? ”
“ Six weeks since—the beginning of July. Dur-
ing the time I was taking the first box I lost only
one night’s rest, but since then I have never had
the least return of the old complaint.”
“ Have you used much of the medicine ? ”
“About four boxes. Previous to my taking
them the pain in my head reduced me to such a
state that I was on the verge of madness. The
last three years I had been very bad, so you can
imagine the pleasure it was to me to find a remedy
that has actually made a woman of me.”
“That is so,” remarked Mr. Ross, who was pre-
sent. “ Had you seen my wife a few months
since and now, you would scarcely believe her to
be the same woman.”
“Yes,” added Mrs. Ross, “my recovery has
been most pronounced and satisfactory 'to me. I
have great faith in Dr. Williams’ Pink Pills for
Pale People, and recommend them wherever pos-
sible.” «
perspiration; my whole chest, once firm and sound,
became sore, tender and irritable; I found myself
unable to sleep, whilst on top of all these strange
and unaccountable sensations came a sharp and
persistent cough that sucked up all my strength
and stirred the phlegm, but failed to move it.
Dull, heavy, restless, faint and aching, I went to
work, and got through somehow. How I got
through, and how I felt afterwards, you can
imagine. I —can remember.
“ ‘ Take half-a-dozen boxes of Dr. Williams’
Pink Pills for Pale People,’ said a friend, ‘ and
you’ll be saved.’
“ After a few boxes had been taken, I was,
honestly, completely cured. I kept on taking
them a little longer, just to make doubly sure, but
there was no necessity. I was absolutely cured,
felt tip-top, and had bade farewell to influenza
and its ills. l!es,” he said, deliberately, “the
marvel has been quicker than even I had antici-
pated. Influenza, headaches, sleeplessness, want of
appetite, listlessness, racking cough, chest-pains,
weakness and phlegm, all disappeared as if under
a magician’s wand. I was as right, as fresh, as
healthy, and as high-spirited as I ever was in my
life.”

A PROMINENT ACTOR WITH THE
THORNTON COMEDY CO.
SPEAKS OF
HIS MARVELLOUS IMPROVEMENT.
Hearing that the popular and versatile actor,
Mr. George P. Carey, now appearing in Adelaide
with the Thornton Comedy Company, had some-
thing to say with regard to the value of Dr. Wil- -
liams’ Pink Pills for Pale People, a representative
from Quiz and the Lantern waited upon him at
the Grand Coffee Palace, Hindley-street, where
he is staying. The interviewer was struck with
wonder at the marvellous change which had taken
place in the personal appearance of Mr. Carey
since his last visit to Adelaide, in 1897, with the
Brough Comedy Company. Then he was seldom
able to walk without the assistance of a stick ; his
face nearly always wore a pinched expression, as
though he was in severe pain ; and, in fact, he had
all the appearances of a man whose system, to use
his own words, was “completely run down.”
Now, however, the stick is discarded as a means
of assistance, no matter what distance he walks,
and his smiling face and genial manner show that
he is in the enjoyment of perfect health. How
this result has been achieved is perhaps better
stated in his own words. He says: “ Last
December, in Sydney, feeling myself very much
run down by the severe attacks of gout and
rheumatism, from which I had suffered for many
years, I took the advice of several friends, and
tried Dr. Williams’ Pink Pills. I have taken
them regularly for six months, and they have
completely built up my system. I regard them as
a wonderful medicine. It could not be expected
that a few months’ course of any medicine would
effect the complete cure of an ailment of 16 years’
standing, but Dr. Williams’ Pink Pills have im-
proved me wonderfully, and I am in great hopes
of their eventually eradicating the disease. lam
a firm believer in their curative powers, and I ean
conscientiously recommend them. (Signed) G. W.
Carey, Grand Coffee Palace, Hindley-street, Ade-
laide, S. A. 27/6/98.”

Fearful General Debility.
A FARMER SAVED FROM DEATH.
“I hear, Mr. Batchelor,” said a reporter re-
cently to Mr. George Batchelor, a well-known
farmer on the Horton River, N.S.W., “ that you
have just experienced a remarkable recovery from
a very long illness.”
“I have, indeed, and I think the case is one
which should have all the publicity possible. I
am 65 years of age, and have been resident in
this district for about 12 years. Prior to my
coming here, I had always enjoyed the best of
health, and I had been accustomed to work very
hard. About six years ago, however, all my
energy seemed to gradually desert me. I suffered
acutely and constantly from pains in my limbs,
lost my appetite, and I did not know what it was
to get a good night’s sleep. Work of the very
lightest nature became beyond me, and I could do
nothing but sit by the window and watch the
others work the farm. I gave up all hope of ever
being able to do any more work, and almost be-
lieved that every week would be my last. In my
endeavors to stay the ravages of the ailment
which was gradually drawing me into the grave, I
tried innumerable so-called cures, and swallowed
an unconscionable quantity of medical compounds,
but, beyond giving me temporary relief occasion-
ally, they, none of them, did me any good ; in
fact, I honestly believe that the majority of them
only aggravated my sufferings. I was giving up
in despair a few months back when I read in a
newspaper of some wonderful cures effected by
Dr. Williams’ Pink Pills for Pale People, and I
determined to give them a trial. After taking the
first box, I felt considerably relieved, and sr.
marked was the improvement that I decided to
continue their use. I did so, and up to the pre-
sent have taken five boxes. My inability has all
disappeared, and I am as strong and hearty as I
ever was in my life. It is no trouble to me to do
a day’s farm work now, and I feel equal to walk
ing thirty miles a day. Everyone who knows me
can testify to the great cure these Pills have
effected, and in recommending them for similar
cases to mine I can honestly say that they are
worth more than their weight in gold. If every-
body knew their true value, there would be no
other medtetinee sold.


Mr. Frank Senior, who has been chemist
to the N.S. Wales Governors for many years past,
has conferred a blessing upon the citizens of his
country by discovering a wonderful cure for head-
ache. The new remedy cures instantaneously, is
very palatable, and perfectly harmless to both
ladies and gentlemen. Moreover, it is perfectly
effectual, no matter what the cause of the head-
ache may be. This cure, the result of years of

[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
Dargan scanned his wife’s head on the canvas
and frowned ; something in the full, sensuous lips
fired the old spark in his mind. He dropped his
palette on a near pedestal and moved the easel
into the sunlight. The red mouth seemed to
stand away from the pallid flesh-tints —for Dargan,
with a true craftsman’s insistence, had brought out
the leading feature until it laughed at you in gross
mockery.
A big bee floated into the atelier and buzzed
over the rare Indian bric-a-brac. The young
artist watched it curiously, half hoping that it
might settle on the painted mouth of the
picture. He had l>een married a year, and of late
had begun to discover that there were better-
looking men in the world than himself —men
whose hearts and thoughts were in unison with
his wife’s—lisping, white-cheeked actors, flesh-
burdened athletes whose colossal
pleased her eye more than his own poorly-
developed frame ever could. Again and again
he had tried to catch her tripping; but Eleanor
Dargan was a clever creature, and she was
fond of the luxuries that her successful husband
could well afford. He had a thousand suspicions,
but no proof, no certainty even. So, in a moment
of fury and pique, he had begun her picture, filled
with a savage desire to limn her as—as he dreamt
she might be. And her image, after passing
through the alembic of his distraught mind, was
revealed on the canvas—a fleering voluptuary
bosomed with the fullness of compass-strokes and
so furiously iinpressioned that her breasts con-,
jured up two naked hills of lust.
* * * *
A figure in the doorway blotted out the sun-
shine. Dargan winced at sight of the black-
robed young priest standing on his threshold. He
was in no mood for conversation.
The young Dominican nodded gravely, and ran
his eye over the walls of the cedar-lined atelier,
from the pink shepherds in the Raphael copies to
the theatric landscapes and nude hussies of latter-
day impressionists, until he confronted the leering
head in the centre of the studio. Dargan watched
him moodily. The priest recoiled half-a-pace,
with hand uplifted to shut it out. “ I don’t like
it,” lie said, harshly. “ Cover it up! cover it
up! ”
Dargan stood with his legs apart, a savage
pucker lining his broad forehead. “Can’t you
understand that it’s my trade to reproduce the
best, aye, and the worst, in a man’s or woman’s
face ? ”
He tilted back his wife’s portrait until the
sensuous lips seemed to redden in the sun. The
priest walked deliberately across the atelier, and
looked out at the landscape. Dargan watched
him, full of mutinous anger. For one moment,
he felt like flinging himself upon this black-robed
intruder, and battering him to earth. It had
never occurred to him before that this man was
Eleanor’s confessor—the living casket that held
her inmost thoughts, her lies, her secret loves,
perhaps ! Now, the knowledge of it shook him
like a heavy sea.
* * * *
The priest remained with his face to the window,
his fingers twitching, his head bent. He had
known Dargan from boyhood, and the memory of
their school-days was very dear to him. He
stepped to where the young artist sat, and, patting
his shoulder gently, relapsed unconsciously into a
brogue : “ Faith ! the world is not unkind to ye,
Tim. And —and why are ye throubled ? ”
Dargan writhed under his touch, still raging
that this dark stripling should know so much and
he so little.
The priest watched him furtively and sighed.
Dargan heard the sigh, and his alert mind asked
twenty reasons for it. A half-shaped thought dis-
pelled his brooding anger : was it possible to win
such a secret from this calm Dominican ? He
closed his eyes to shut out the black-robed figure,
whose very shadow seemed to retain the dignity
of his Church —august, secret, implacable with the
traditions of 18 centuries. It was a foolish hope,
and he knew it, but . . . some day he might catch
the Dominican unawares, and, by a sudden stroke
of cunning, wrest the truth.
* * * *
The priest faced him again with folded arms.
“ ’Tis success that’s spoiling your hand, Tim.
Man 1 you’re all of a thrimble.”
Dargan moistened his lips and covered his face.
“ You are right; success is spoiling my hand and
brain. Last week I made a sketch of myself with
a cuckoo perched on my forehead : it isn’t a nice
frame of mind—having a cuckoo on your brain, is
it, Vinny?” And his anger made him add: “I
beg pardon; Father Vincent, I should say.”
He was ashamed of the sneer as soon as uttered,
but it passed unnoticed. The priest had turned
his back, and his eyes were fixed on the blue bend
of the Parramatta, half-seen through the close-
planted pines. Perhaps it recalled the willow-
skirted Shannon and the day whem Dargan flung
himself from the college racer to hold him up when
drowning in mid-current. Dargan’s voice roused
him from a cycle of thoughts that whirled from
boyhood to the day when he had married the
young artist to the woman in the picture.
“I may be doing Eleanor an injustice. God
forgive me if I am ! It seems hard that my life
should be spoilt by this uncertainty. I can’t
work: how can I when I’m always picturing her
lip-to-lip with some damned libertine? If I knew
the truth I’d—l’d let her rip ! ”
No answer from the priest; his fingers were
bunched behind his back; his strong face made
no sign.
“ I can’t sleep, I can’t paint,” droned Dargan ;
“ my hand is against me; my brain seems to rot.
I wonder how long it will be before they tie me
up in a mad-house ? ’
* * * *
No answer from the priest; his face was very
still. Perhaps the icy grip of the Shannon water
had laid hold of him again, dragging and choking
him in beds of ooze and weed until the boyish
hand of Dargan groped, clung, and lifted him into
the blessed sunlight.
He bent his head and stepped to the door ; his
lean shadow swept across the face on the canvas.
He halted before it uncertainly; a tiny black
cross under the white column of throat attracted
him.
“ Why ? ” He flung himself round towards the
brooding artist; “ why is that there ? ”
Dargan peered over his shoulder, savagely alert.
“ It’s the crucifix you gave her on the day you
married us. I was glad when I thought of put-
ting it in the picture.”
“ Don’t! ” The priest’s dark face turned to
Dargan’s for a moment; then he stepped to the
door and passed out at the gate.
* * * ♦
The bee floated past into the broad lane of sun-
shine and settled on a blazing poppy. Dargan
remained standing with his legs apart, laughing,
laughing softly like the man he was, the man who
had won a damnable truth from an unconsciously
uttered innuendo.
He took up some turpentine and a rag, and with
his knife scraped the red-lipped woman from the
canvas —from his life.

Bush Notes.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
“ Why, you’re bushed now. If you don’t look
out, you’ll soon have a chance of proving it.”
“ Yes, I’m just about likely. You can go
where you like—l’m going this way.”
“ You’d better not, Steen; I know the paddock
well. ’Twas me that fenced it, and it’s 10 miles
square, without a drop of water, ’cept the dam.”
“ I don’t care; you’re darned well bushed your-
self.”
“ All right! go then ; and you’ll soon find which
leg is the longer.”
They parted.
The two fencers, who were sub-dividing the 10-
mile block, had been talking about people, when
bushed, always going to the left. They had begun
to get heated, w T hen Steen deviated slightly to the
right, and this argument ensued. Steen, the un-
believer, was left to be convinced.
After going a short distance, Col turned and
looked back at him.
“ You’re going altogether wrong,” he shouted.
No answer.
“Do you hear?”
“Yes; go on.”
Col went. All the way home, he had to argue
with himself that Steen deserved a perishing for
his perversity. That he was a fool, and needed
experience. Somehow, he could not be easy in his
mind.
At sundown he reached camp and began to pre-
pare supper. He thought he would only cook
enough for himself, but, somehow, he filled the
billy to the old thing and put on the usual amount
of mutton.
Three or four times while the meal was cooking
he looked up as though expecting someone. Soon
the billy was boiled and the tea made. He waited
a few minutes, looked round, paused, listened, and
then settled to his lonely meal.
“Let’s see,” he thought, “this is four years
Steen and I have been working together; and
this is the first row ever we had. Hope he turns
up all right; a man could easily perish this
weather.” A stick broke in the scrub. “There
he comes,” thought Col; “won’t I deal it out
to him about getting bushed ! ” Putting on an
unconcerned air, he waited. A kangaroo came
hopping out, sighted the tent, sheered off,
stopped, and bolted away. The light in the west
was almost gone. A laughing jackass shrieked
out in discordant, hooting peals. “ Shut up ! you
infernal fool! ” muttered Col, “ what the deuce
are you yelling at ? ”
The daylight failed and the firelight began to
cast strange shadows. A curlew wailed. Col sat,
eating slowly. Suddenly there wags a rush behind
him. He wheeled round and discovered an
opossum climbing for his breakfast. With a
gesture of impatience he put away the eatables
and sat gazing in the fire. A screech-owl shrieked
mournfully. “ Dash it! ” muttered Col, “ I never
knew the bush was so noisy ; ” and he moved un-
easily. “ Wonder how Steen’s getting on. If he
doesn’t turn-up to-nig l t suppose I’ll have to look
for him to-morrow. Fine chance of finding him,
too. Better turn in, anyway ; don’t want him to
come and find me waiting for him.”
Three or four times during the night Col woke
and listened. Morning broke and he was early
astir. “ Getting serious,” he said to himself as
he prepared his breakfast. “No salt junk for me
to-day; too dry.” Going to a neighboring tree
he took down the water-bag. “Suppose I may
as well,” he muttered, and set out. In about an
hour he cut the tracks. All morning he travelled
them, and at mid-day sat down for a short spell.
“ Steen’s a terror to walk,” he thought as he sat ;
then his attention became fixed on the water-bag.
Twice he picked it up, looked at it, and felt its
weight. “Won’t do.” Getting up he headed
away from the tracks. In a little less than an
hour he reached the tank and refilled the water-
bag. He struck straight across towards the way
the tracks headed, on the chance of cutting them.
After travelling a while he began to think him-
self a fool for risking it. Two or three times he
stopped and looked towards the place he had left
the tracks to go to the tent. Each time he went
on again. At last he picked up the tracks afresh.
This time he stuck to them like a blood-hound.
At sundown he found Steen. He was walking
round and round a tree muttering incoherently.
“Well, you fool ! ” remarked Col.
Steen stared stupidly, then, seeing the water-
bag, jumped forward, seized it, and raised it to
his mouth. The sides of the bag began to fall in.
“Hold on, man!” remonstrated Col, “you’ll
kill yourself; ” and he grabbed the bag. Steen
made no reply, but clutched more tightly. They
fought for it like demons.
At length Steen’s senses returned. He let go,
and articulated “ You’re right, old man.” They
sat down for a rest.
The journey home was done in silence. Once
there, Col soon set the tucker out, and, as Steen
fell-to, remarked :
“Anyway, you’ve solved the question.”
“Yes,” was the reply, “I went straight enough
—too deuced straight. It’s nearly worth the
misery, though, to show you I was right.”
“ Wish,” responded Col, drily, “ I hadn’t taken
the trouble to find you.”
They both laughed, and turned in.

LIME-FRUIT JUICE
The “LANCET” says: “We counsel the Public to
drink Montserrat Lime Juice whenever and where-
ever they list. It is a far more wholesome drink
than any form of alcohol.”
MONTSERRAT LIME FRUIT JUICE, either alone or
with Soda Water, is a delightfully satisfying thirst-quencher.
It leaves a grateful sense of cleanliness and freshness in the
mouth, and is very palatable. Perfectly pure and wholesome,
and is sold everywhere in Imperial Quarts and Pints.
Montserrat is made from cultivated limes.

Terse Verse.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
Monotony is Death.
The placid dame has less success
Than she who stirs a little strife,
And mingles sweet with bitterness—
Variety’s the spice of wife.
Liberty and Woman.
A woman carved a statue tall
Of Liberty, as custom teaches.
She made her queenly, fair and all,
But put her in a pair of breeches.
A Miser’s Epitaph.
Here one is laid who, whilst he’d breath,
Was misanthrope and miserly ;
But lo ! the great reformer, Death,
Has won him to philanthropy.
Behold the blades he makes to grow
Where grew no grass a year ago !
The Critic.
They sent to him a noble hound.
Upon its back a flea he found,
And wrought an hour in churlish glee
To bitterly review the flea !
The M.P.
He’ll never hang, if on the gallows high
They let him say his say before he die.
The Law.
Those men who quick to law betake,
The folly show
Of him who grasps a venorned snake
To whip a foe.
A Politician.
Five wasted years he did deplore—
Five,years of life elate
Lost turning backward to restore
The misplaced aspirate.
Conceit.
An egotist, this friend of mine.
Five feet he stands within his shoon.
He knocks his head,against a sign,
And cries “ Beg pardon ! ” to the moon.
Fight !
Tf tyranny refuse to spare,
Or greed to crush you, forge a bolt!
Pray never for the strength to bear,
But for the courage to revolt!
A Teetotaller.
A sallow man who loves to cram
With texts and tracts his Sunday pupils.
He says he never took a dram—
I know he’s swallowed all his scruples.
Pleasure.
Pursuit of pleasure—that’s the human race,
And yet how few have won her !
We’re all so blind and eager in the chase
We usually outrun her.
A Divine.
Had I to die, and did I rue it,
This man would reconcile me to itl
Precept and Practice.
Is honesty best policy ?
The wise men certify it.
And then they tacitly agree
To leave the fools to try it I
The Ascetic.
All worldly joy is sin, he saith,
And lives a life of misery
In order that at some hour he
May have a happy death.
Love and Constancy.
Once Care beheld with envious stings
That Love was blithe and free,
And wrought a fetter for his wings
And called it Constancy.
EDWARD DYSON.
The modification of Melb. University
statutes which allows a candidate to pass, if his
excellence in one subject counterbalances slight
weakness in another, is only to apply to the first
year in the medical school. Prof. Allen, who
strongly opposed further concession, had doubtless
in his mind the American backwoods practitioner
who, when summoned in haste, “ didn’t take no
stock in that there disease, but was death on
fits.”
Cairns Post tells a sad tale of a mining-
expert who came hot-foot from the South to ex-
ploit the beautiful boom. Alleged that —
“ Two men were sinking on a big lode of copper
when the ‘ expert ’ came along. Both miners were
on top at the time, and to them the ‘ expert ’ un-
folded his mind. ‘ Well, yes ! and if we let you in will
you boom it along ? ’ they asked. ‘Of course,’ replied the
expert, ‘ I will do whatever I can for you, and, as the
Blank Syndicate is already nibbling at your claim, I can
get appointed to examine and report on the mine.’
‘ Well,’ replied the miners, ‘ you had better have a look at
the reef as she is in the sink, and then you will know
what you are doing.' To this proposition the expert
acceded, and was lowered down the straight shaft 40
feet to the bottom. He put in a quarter of an hour knock-
ing off bits of the lode with a gad, and, after gathering
them up to put in the bucket, he discovered that the oil
drum had gone to the surface. In response to his cries of
‘ lower away,’ one of the owners of the claim looked down
the shaft and asked the would-be-expert what he wanted.
‘ I want the bucket,’ replied the man in the sink. ‘ Oh, you
do, do you ? Then you are likely to want it a long time.’
‘ Why, what’s up ? ’ anxiously queried the expert. To
which the man on the top replied, ‘ Your game is up, and
the bucket is up, and, what’s more, it is going to stay up.’
Then a long confab took place between the expert and
the miners, with the result that at the end of an hour or
two a pen, ink and paper were lowered to the bottom by a
long cord, and the expert sat down in the sink while he
wrote as follows —‘ I herewith admit that I threatened
Blank and Blank to blackmail their copper mine, un-
less they consented to give me a share in the said
mine ; that in consideration of their giving me
such share I would manage to get engaged by the
Blank Syndicate, to report on such mine ; that I would
boom it for all it was worth, and that I would engage
that my report would result in their obtaining at least 100
per cent, more for their property than they would other-
wise obtain from the Blank Syndicate. I also admit that
I am a blackguard, a thief, and a liar, and am unfit to
associate with honest miners on this field. Signed, Blank
Blank.’ When this document reached the surface, per
medium of the cord before-mentioned, the unhappy ex-
pert was hauled safely to the top—to leave hurriedly and
sadly for the South again.”
The Primitive Element.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
Copeland was a young man of advanced ideas;
he wished to see the wilder side of “ colonial
life. “Go North,” said a friend to him in Auck-
land. “ Travel in the Northern Peninsula if you
want the primitive element. In Dunedin, Christ-
church, Wellington and here we worship Mrs.
Grundy and £s. d. Up North they worship
nature and ”
Stanley Copeland went North in the glare of the
Auckland summer. He rode slowly overland
across wastes of manuka-land where the gum-
digger’s whare and the settler’s hut stand side by
side. He edged the inland harbors and the far-
reaching sea creeks; getting accommodation for
himself and his horse at the little township hotels.
He found the primitive elements his friend had
mentioned. He ate cold boiled schnapper and
hot potatoes off tin plates, drank boiled
tea out of thick-rimmed cups, and slept on
hard beds guiltless of sheets. Then he crossed the
dividing ranges where forest and scrub untouched
by settler’s axe stretch from sea to sea ; and the
bell-like notes of the moke-moke echoing through
green arches of foliage are the only sounds of life;
then by a white clay track down a fern-clad spur
to Umuka, an unmapped village on the shores of
a lovely, desolate harbor. He found lodgings at
Hammond’s, a long, low building with sod walls
and raupo roof, that was hotel, store, post-office,
and gossiping-house combined. He drank whisky
that had never seen excise ; he e’ept on a munga-
munga bed that held no fleas, and breakfasted off
fat, sweet flounders, speared but an hour before.
He was attracted by the primitive quaintness of
the place and by its wild, strange beauty ; but he
would have moved northwards up the coast, had
he not met another attraction.
She was a “ primitive element ” with golden hair
that shone like the rippled water ; with a glorious
figure fettered by nought heavier than a light
print dress. She glanced at him with great, un-
conscious eyes and strode into the kitchen. Cope-
land had tethered his horse in the swamp by the
creek ; he deliberately slipped the rope over the
animal’s head, smacked it on the rump and sent it
hillwards ; then he went back to the house. The
Primitive Element was clearing away the breakfast
things.
“ Good morning,” said Copeland politely.
“Morning,” she replied briefly.
“ My horse has got away.”
“ Didn’t you tether him ? ’
“ Yes.”
“ Broke the rope ?”
“No, slipped it.”
“ Oh! ”
“Do you know anybody who’d go after the
horse? I’d pay him well.”
“ Don’t know. Bendigo might, if you offered
him a pound.”
“ Where’s Bendigo ? ”
“He’ll be down to-night.”
The Primitive Element leant against the table.
She had twisted her golden hair into a big coil,
but her feet were still bare, and the thin print-
dress open at the neck showed her smooth white
throat. Copeland worshipped her beauty with
his eyes; she seemed to him a goddess as she
lounged there in graceful attitudes. He intro-
duced himself, and she told him quite simply that
she was Bill Hammond’s niece, and that her
father was dead and her mother had run away with
Jim Cottle. “ They call me Sis,” she said, “ but
I never was christened.”
Copeland established himself with the lord of
the house by putting a pound-note in his hand for
the recovery of the horse and paying him a week’s
board in advance ; then, at his leisure, lie began
to woo the Primitive Element. She went out on
the hills with him ; she took him out to the fish-
ing ground in the flat-bottomed punt. He Adored
her beauty and reverenced her primeval sim-
plicity. “So unconsciously innocent,” he mur-
mured, as she moved near him, with golden hair
falling loose and thin dress gaping at the neck.
He stifled all promptings to take her in his arms
and pour out his love. He would win her with a
delicate courtesy, fitted to her instinctive modesty ;
then he would take her away, and lavish on her
all the delights of the earth ; for he was rich. He
thought with a thrill of that glorious figure richly
dressed ; of the round arms sparkling with jewels,
and the glorious hair piled on the shapely head.
“I will make her love me,” he cried, and he treated
her as respectfully as a queen.
With the warmth of the golden summer in his
blood and the unconscious invitations she gave
him, the wonder is that he wooed so calmly when
all day long he was about with her. Bendigo did
not come down for nearly a week ; he had been on
a drunken spree. Then he went after the horse
and was away four days. He came back on the
day when Copeland had resolved to declare his
love, and Bendigo’s presence in the house put a
stoptoany wooing ; but Copeland waited patiently.
He would find her on the knoll where they had sat
together evening after evening. The fires of im-
patience burnt in his veins ; the glamor of the
northern summer intoxicated him ; but he waited
till the sun dipped towards the ranges amid islands
of crimson clouds and sky seas of opal green. Then
in the stillness of evening, he stole toward the
knoll. She was there—but her golden hair hung
loose over Bendigo’s shoulder ; Bendigo clasped
the waist Copeland had longed to encircle.
“ Who’s that galoot ’as lost his ’orse, Sis ? ”
Bendigo was asking.
“ Oh,” answered Copeland’s goddess, “he’s a
fat-headed fool of a new-chum—he takes me for a
damned lady ! ”

storekeeper in a way-back town, and was hauled
from a water-hole by a stranger who spread him
out, slapped his feet, pounded his breast, and
kneaded his stomach, until at last the rescued sat
up, supported by the arm of his saviour. “ Ah,
