THE “KEEPER” PILE PILL
(Registered).
The PROPRIETORS of these Pills are well aware that
there are many remedies (some of them really beneficial)
for this painful disease already in the market, but know-
ing- as (hey do the wonderful success of the “ KEEPER ”
PILL they have no hesitation in placing it in the very
front rank of Curative Medicines.
For years the medicine had only a local and limited
use, but now arrangements have been completed to make
its merits more widely known, and the Australasian
colonies will have an opportunity of sharing with the old
country the benefits of this valuable remedy.
The medicine will be sold on its merits, in confident
assurance that its beneficent action will be a real boon to
sufferers.
It will not cure Piles in old and chronic cases by a single
dose. It will not cure every disease that flesh is heir to,
but it will cure Piles if taken in reasonable time, and
IT WILL GIVE RELIEF IN ALL CASES,
however stubborn and chronic, and the proprietors are
continually in receipt of most flattering and unsolicited
testimonials. Price, 2 6 per box (red label).
The “KEEPER” LIVER PILL.
We constantly find cases of Hemorrhoids which are
complicated with liver trouble, and we have therefore
perfected a Liver Pill to be used alone, or in conjunction
with the “ Keeper” Pile Pill. We do not claim for this,
or for any of our preparations, any marvellous curative
properties. We simply advise you, if suffering from slug-
gish or torpid liver, to spend 1/3 in a box of “ KEEPER”
LIVER PILLS (blue label) and you will not regret it.
The “KEEPER” HEALTH PILL.
If you are worried in business, if you are Jaded by over-
work, if you are generally run down from any cause, TRY
THIS PILL. It is a prince of pick-me-ups. In one size
only (brown label), 6 6 per box.
The title the “KEEPER” PILL is registered as our
trade mark throughout the colonies, and any infringement
thereof will be promptly dealt with by the sole proprietors,
The JOHN F. TAYLOR COMPANY.
Head Office for Australasia: 409 Collins-street, Melbourne,
Victoria.
Notice.-—The John F. Taylor Co. will send a sample box
of “KEEPER” PILE PILLS to any address in Austral-
asia on receipt of a postal order for 2 6 ; the “ KEEPER ”
LIVER PILL for 1/3; the “KEEPER” HEALTH PILL
for 6,6 ; or one box of each for 10,'-

HOW BABIES SUFFER
From Torturing Humors
When their tender Skins are literally On Fire with Itching and
Burning Eczemas and other Itching, Scaly, and Blotchy Skin and
Scalp Diseases, none but mothers realize.
To know that a single application of the Cuticura Reme-
dies will, in the great majority of cases, afford instant and complete
relief, permit rest and sleep, and point
to a permanent and economical (because
so speedy) cure, and not to use them
without a moment’s delay, is to be guilty
of positive inhumanity, it No greater leg-
acy can be bestowed upon a child than
a skin •without blemish and a body nour -
ishcd with pure blood.

skin purifier and beautifier, externally, instantly allay the most intense itching, burn-
ing, and inflammation, soothe and heal raw and irritated surfaces, clear the skin and
scalp of crusts and scales, and restore the hair, while Cuticura Resolvent, the new
blood and skin purifier and greatest of humor remedies, cleanses the blood of all
impurities and poisonous elements, and thus removes the cause.

‘A GOLDEN SHANTY.’
Of all prisoners, writes an old N.S.W.
gaol-official, the Chinaman feels incarceration the
least. And which feels it most ? The hardy
ruffian who has exulted in the freedom of lawless-
ness and is now doomed to 20 years’ entombment?
The refined bank-swindler, who leaves a gay and
elegant society for the dismal solitude of the cell?
The love-sick bank-clerk, who has embezzled in
order to win the favor of the loved one’s eyes 7
The poor little sempstress, who has broken her
mother’s heart by stealing ribbon for a Sunday
dress? or the well-trained girl, nursed in a home
of purity and comfort, who has fallen fpom hope,
love and religion. No ! But there is one who
moans inside the gaol-wall, who is tortured by the
clank of chains, the snap of bolts, the click of
looks, the grating of warders’ boots upon the
sanded passages ; who repents not, yet the whole
time suffers agony ; who, conscienceless, is yet the
most afflicted ; who cannot sleep, or eat; whose
days are days of wretchedness, whose nights are
nights of woe. He is the child of Nature’s wilds
—the fast-disappearing aboriginal.
The Prince of Wales is just now starring
in the capacity of a heaven-born diplomatist. The
result of his visit to the dying Czar was a guar-
antee of everlasting friendship between Russia
and Great Britain. Albert Edward showed sur-
prising tact and artfulness at St. Petereburg, it
appears. No sooner had Death scratched the old
Czar’s name off the list of reigning monarchs than
H.R.H. saluted the new Czar with the title of
“Your Majesty.” He was positively the very
first person to clutch the opportunity, and
Nicholas 11. was deeply impressed. “0, uncle,”
cried the young man, when his grief had abated,
“ What a diplomatist you are, and what a pity
the English constitution precludes you from being
your country’s Minister for Foreign Affairs!”
Thus runs the story, which probably grew from a
small beginning of fact. Albert Edward can
scarcely be a less intelligent person than his

Ed. Bulletin, —Let me tell you of the
“nearness” of some of the big monetary companies.
Nearly all of them have put their station-
managers on rations : flour, sugar, tea, salt, meat
and soap. In some cases the quantity of these
rations is limited to a certain weight, but where
this is done one ration is generously allowed for
visitors. On most Western stations, should the
manager rush into the wild extravagance of a tin
of jam or bottle of pickles it is forthwith debited
to his private account. I know one large station
where the manager had included 2 pkts. starch in
the list of supplies required, but the item was
struck out with an intimation that it was wholly
unnecessary. Another foolhardy manager ordered
2 gals, whisky among the stores for the
year, but this gave his directors such a
shock that he was promptly relieved of the
management. However, the fact that the co.’s
don’t consider that even a very limited quantity
of grog is necessary to the effective working of the
station doesn’t prevent their inspector partaking
very freely of the manager’s private supply when
he visits the station. I knew one back-country
station where potatoes were not deemed a neces-
sary. Well, the inspector arrived, and that night,
at dinner, was about to help himself from the
vegetable-dish when the storekeeper interposed :
“No you don’t! Those spuds are my private
property —bought ’em from the Chinkie last week.
The company don’t think ’em necessary for us—
and I don’t think ’em necessary for you.” That
storekeeper might have been seen next day riding
along a, lonely road to the nearest township withhis
swag in front of him ; however, he said he reckoned
he’d given the inspector a facer, and, after all, there
was more money in rabbiting. Yet another in-
stance of man-grinding. Mr. Blank had owned
a station for 17 years. The thing had been one
long pull at the devil’s tail. Blank was a first-
class manager, whose ability was recognised ; but
the station, which had originally been fairly good,
got over - run with pine scrub, necessitating
enormous outlay in clearing. Then came the
rabbits, and it had to be wire-netted at great
expense. Blank had been getting deeper and
deeper into the co., who had absorbed all his
original capital and all that the station had
returned, with the exception of .£3OO a year, which
had been allowed for private expenses. Then
the co. took possession of the place, but re-
tained him as manager at £2OO a year.
Shortly after this the co. took over another
station adjoining and placed it also under Blank’s
management, but while doubling his work and
responsibility they at the same time cut his screw
down to £l5O. Why did he stand it? Well, he
was a married man with a family, and he had to
stand it. Now you can understand that if the
co.’s are so disgustingly mean with their employes
who are in responsible positions the rank and file
are not likely to fare too well. Swiftly and surely
the whole of the Western Riverina country is
falling into the hands of big monetary institutions,
and where four men were employed a few years
ago one is now deemed enough, and if it were pos-
sible they would have that one at a wage that
would scarcely keep body and soul together. Now
we have the N.S.W. Legislative Council, which
may be said to largely represent these remorseless
institutions, endeavouring to emasculate the Land
Bill because they think some of its most useful
clauses inimical to the interests of the mortgagees.

SATURDAY, FEBRUARY 9, 1895.
The Late Federal Conference.
The conference of Australian Premiers, at
Hobart, has thrown some more valuable
darkness on the vexed subject of Federation.
Considering the character of the assemblage,
this is about all that any reasonable person
expected it would throw. All the members
of the gathering were, it is true, sufficiently
enthusiastic about Federation in the abstract,
and among them they contributed a large
quantity of loose and eloquent sentiment to
the discussion, and pervaded the subject
with many magnificent perorations about the
glory and greatness and general haziness
of the coming Commonwealth. But, unfor-
tunately, everybody who deals with the sub-
ject contributes loose eloquence to the
Federal cause, and of that commodity there
is already a great deal too much. When the
conference settled down to details it proved
to be just as narrow, selfish, suspicious and
hopelessly divided as usual. The outcome
of its labors may be summed up in four
sentences: (1) Each member is willing co
federate if his own province gets its full
share, or a little more than its full share,
of financial advantage thereby ; but not
one, so far as appears at present, is
willing to sacrifice a copper for the
sake of unity. (2) Each one is willing
to federate if his own province gets its
full share, or a good deal more, of politi-
cal power. In this case the most ravenously
exorbitant of the crowd is Westralia, which
wants about fourteen times its fair propor-
tion of representation on a population basis;
and about the most moderate is New South
Wales, which only wants to run the show by
itself, or thereabouts. (3) Each province
demands that the Federal Parliament shall
be pledged to run the country for all time on
such lines as are required for the grinding of
its own unwholesome political axe. And (4)
the bosses of those provinces where the Fat
Man is uppermost demand that the Federal
constitution shall be so framed that Fat
Man shall remain uppermost in their own
territories, and that he shall get and remain
uppermost in the other provinces, and that
Uxiited Australia shall be run on solid Fat
principles for evermore. Apart from these
few points of disagreement the Conference
may be said to have been tolerably unani-
mous. /
« * *
Despite all differences of opinion, however,
certain useless “resolutions” were arrived
at by the vote of the majority, while an in-
dignant minority dissented violently in the
background. The decision of the majority
was that each province should pass an Act
authorising the election, by direct vote of
the people, of ten representatives to another
Federal Convention ; that the Convention
should draft a Federal Constitution ; and
that the Government of each province should
then submit the Constitution to a direct vote
of the people, by which vote it would either
be rejected or accepted without alteration.
This agreement, so far as it goes, is a simple,
equitable and business-like proposition, and,
but for certain conditions which make it null
and void and wholly useless, would offer a
better show of definite results than anything
yet suggested. But trouble began even at
this initial stage of the proceedings. Premier
Forrest, of Westralia, where the Fat Man
interest is paramount, demanded that the
members of the Convention shall be ap-
pointed, not by the people, but by Parlia-
ment, and that Parliament shall accept or
reject the Constitution without any popular
vote whatever. In Westralia, Parliament
is, to all intents and purposes, John
Forrest and his little group of Fat
supporters, and the kind of Federal
Constitution which would be acceptable
to this clique, and the kind which
would be accepted by a popular vote, are as
widely different as any two things can be.
Unless he gets his way, Westralia stands
out. Therefore Premier Forrest’s terms
virtually are that the Constitution of the
Commonwealth must be fixed to suit the
corrupt majority in the most corrupt and
least representative Legislature of the
smallest province (numerically speaking) in
Australia.
* * *
Premier Nelson, of Queensland, is another
dissentient on very similar grounds. Unlike
Forrest, Nelson does not demand that the
other provinces should decide the question
according to his own plan ; he only demands
complete freedom of action for himself. His
idea is that each provincial Government
should elect its ten representatives at the
Convention according to its own plan, and
should decide to accept or reject the Con-
stitution in any way it pleases. This
obviously means that, instead of the Queens-
land members being elected by the people
they will be appointed by the Boodlewraith
Cabinet, and instead of the Constitution being
submitted to the popular vote, it will be sub-
mitted to the Boodlewi’aith Parliament, the
other provinces, meanwhile, being at liberty
to conduct their own share of the business as
they please. This will ensure that the Fede-
ration scheme will be rejected if it gives the
Federal Parliament power to abolish cheap
nigger-labor and land-grant railways, or if it
provides for the election of that Parliament
by manhood suffrage instead of by a solid
property vote, or if it doesn’t provide an
Upper House of landholders, or otherwise
conform to the Fat Man standard. As the
sort of Constitution which the southern pro-
vinces would accept would never be adopted
by the Queensland Boodle Parliament, and
the one that Parliament would accept would
be rejected with loathing by the other
provinces, Queensland may also be counted
out for the present. When Nelson and
Forrest are both numbered with the poli-
tical dead the situation may be altered, but,
at present, the case is seemingly hopeless.
» • •
r Even apart from the two dissentient pro-
vinces, however, there is material enough to
go on with. A Commonwealth of N.S. W.,
Victoria, Tasmania, and S.A. would embrace
seven-eighths of the population and a still
larger proportion of the wealth of the coun-
try, and its weight and influence would
assuredly bring in the other two when their
present Fat Man bosses have gone to
their Parliamentary grave. But there are
other difficulties in the way. The conference
of Premiers adjourned in haste to permit
certain of its members to attend the sittings
of the Federal Council, and therefore many
of their interprovincial jealousies were sup-
pressed through want of time for expression.
For this, however, they made abundant
amends at the Council, h Barlow, an obscure
banker from Queensland, enthusiastically
denounced the proposal to submit anything
whatsoever to the popular suffrage, on the
brazen assumption that only “agitators”
would vote, and expressed a cordial hope
that the proposed Federal movement would
be a failure, and that the slow and impotent
Federal Council would remain the only
emblem of Australian “unity.” J. M.
Davies, of Victoria, objected to the “pool-
ing ” of the various public debts, on the
ground that it might mean each province
guaranteeing the liabilities of its neighbors.
This, undoubtedly, is just what Federation
will mean—in fact, it can’t possibly mean
anything else, and this objection to the
first essential of union is significant. The
same turbid authority objected to the estab-
lishment of a Federal Court of Appeal for
the stereotyped reason that “ the time is not
yet ripe.” Most people consider that the time
is not only ripe, but tolerably rotten,
and, in any case, it is difficult to see how there
can be a Federation without a Federal Court
of Appeal. The Council, however, decided
that, as a substitute for that institution, “the
Queen” should be requested to appoint an
Australian Judge to hear Australian appeals
in London, so that the local suitor will have
to go 12,000 miles at enormous expense to
get the same justice which the same Judge
could have given him in Australia. Also,
Australia is to pay the salary of this Judge—
who will get, no doubt, an extra allowance to
compensate for his unnecessary remoteness.
Tims the Council, even while talking Federa-
tion, was doing its best to make any real
Federation impossible.
# • *
Then Fysh, of Tasmania, announced that
his province would not, in any case, give up
the duty on Queensland sugar, so that
interprovincial Freetrade, which is another
necessary concomitant of Federation, ap-
parently goes by the board, if Fysh can
have it so. Arch hr, an ancient remnant
of the M‘llwraith regime, stated—what
everybody already knew-that Queensland’s
Boodle Cabinet would not federate unless
the Parliament of the Commonwealth was
prohibited from touching the Kanaka labor
question ; the cheap and murderous nigger
being of more importance, in the opinion of
Boodlewraith, than Australian unity. Hao
kett, a dull nonentity from Westralia,
declared that his Government would have
nothing whatever to do with any scheme
which referred anything to a popular vote.
The fallen Patterson, speaking on behalf of
the province which lately rejected him and
all his works, demanded that the Constitu-
tion Bill of the forgotten 1891 Convention
should be adopted. Dobson, of Tasmania,
suggested that New South Wales should be
ejected altogether from the Commonwealth.
Finally, there was a violent disagreement, in
the course of which the Victorian members
withdrew altogether from the meeting, and
the Federal Council closed up its abortive
existence for the year.
t « •
Towards the close of the alleged proceed-
ings, however, Premier Turner contrived
to cast an entirely new gloom over the pro-
spects of the Commonwealth. According to
the scheme of the Conference, the various
Legislatures are to pass a bill authorising the
people of each province to elect ten repre-
sentatives to a Convention ; the Convention
is to draft a Federal Constitution ; the Con-
stitution is to be submitted to a popular vote
for acceptance or rejection ; and if accepted
the Parliaments are to address the Imperial
Legislature asking for the necessary Enabling
Act. The bill authorising this procedure
will probably be passed without very much
difficulty in New South Wales and South
Australia, but the fat and aggressive Legis-
lative Councils of Victoria and Tasmania,
with their inborn hatred of an appeal to the
people in any form, are likely to block the
way. Assuming, however, that the measure
is passed, that the people elect Democratic
representatives, that these representatives
sink their local jealousies sufficiently to
frame a Democratic Constitution which will
meet all requirements, and that the popular
vote accepts it by a huge majority—even
then, so Turner carefully explains, nothing
whatever will have been done. The popular
vote won’t count for anything at all. The
Constitution must still go through both
Houses of the Legislature in the good old
way, so that if it is Democratic enough to
pass the popular vote it will be rejected, or
amended out of all shape and form, by the
bigoted Tories of the Upper House; and if it
is bigoted enough to satisfy the Upper
House the people will have none of it.
Moreover, even the manner of appointing
the delegates to the Convention is—despite
the resolution to the contrary—to be left to
the option of Parliament, so that there may be
no referendum at all, and the delegates may
be appointed by Parliament, or by the
Ministry, or by the Upper House, or by a
constituency of property-holders, if the Fat
Party can contrive to have it so. Therefore,
the popular vote might as well be left out
of the scheme in the first instance, for, even
if it is authorised by the Legislature, and
taken in due form, it means nothing.
Federation is back at the same old deadlock
as before, and nothing has been accom-
plished, and nothing seems any more likely
to be accomplished than hitherto. A certain
amount of flabby eloquence has been added
to the previous accumulation, but otherwise
things are as they were.
From Gutter to Gallows.
Grenon was a dog with a bad name. Grenon is
hanged duly. He was very possibly innocent of
the particular crime for which he was executed;
but that is a trifle. Chief Justice Barley
comforted him with the reflection that he was
bound to get to the scaffold sooner or later ;
and as he was only a poor devil of a French
convict—friendless, without influence, without
respectable connections, his brutality unre-
deemed by any suggestion of pathos—society
easily salves the thing it calls its conscience.
There is no scarcity of French convicts:
one more or less makes little difference.
Besides, if Grenon did not shoot Heavey, no
doubt he had done lots of things just as bad ;
and, if he had got the chance, he might do many
things worse. Better hang him on general
principles. And as he was such a fool as to
noose his own neck . . . let him take the
consequences of his folly. Give these degraded
brutes to understand, once for all, that if they
choose to be ignorant of our language and our
forms of law, there is for them neither hope nor
mercy. Tell them that the majestic engine which
we call Justice cannot pause in its course because
some suspicious Ishmaelite recklessly refuses
proffered aid, and flings prudence to the winds
in order to asseverate what appear to his
deranged wits conclusive proofs of innocence.
He should learn to know better. What business
had he to be born in a gutter and educated on
the hulks ? Hang him ! hang him ! and inform
the bourgeois god of the collection-plate that,
society having ruined his body, Heaven is wel*
come to his soul.
• 9 9
Guenon must have shot Heavey ; because
Heavey says so. There’s no one to corroborate
Heavey ; but that proves nothing. Grenon,
the consensus of evidence shows, could only
speak broken English, yet he sustained
a fluent conversation with Heavey for a
full quarter of an hour, Heavey says so. This
of itself proves that Grenon shot Heavey.
Besides, Heavey saw Grenon plainly in a
dimly-lighted street at one o’clock in the morn-
ing. Heavey says so. Anyhow, somebody
shot Heavey, and if it was not Grenon, who
was it ? No more suitable person could be
found to shoot Heavey than Grenon, the well-
known criminal. Everybody knows that is just
the thing Grenon would do. Therefore,
Grenon must have shot Heavey. Heavey could
not have shot himself by accident if his assailant
rushed upon him and grasped his wrist,
because the bullet has been found to weigh
slightly less than Heavey’s bullets. It is true
that a bullet loses something in weight on
firing, and something more on passage through
a body; but that proves nothing. It is true
that Heavey’s cartridges and Grenon’s cart-
ridges were of the same calibre, and would fit
either revolver; but that proves nothing.
Besides, Heavey says he didn’t shoot himself;
and that is conclusive. Heavey was a
nonentity ; now he is a hero ; and no man who
shot himself by accident could be a hero.
Therefore, Heavey didn’t shoot himself.
Therefore, Grenon shot Heavey. No other
person could have shot Heavey— not the
Frenchman, for example, who helped Grenon
to buy his revolver, and who did the English
talking to the shopman. E’er the police have
failed to find another Frenchman ; therefore,
there was no other Frenchman; therefore, he
could not have shot Heavey. Besides, Heavey
says Grenon shot him. Therefore, it was im
possible for Grenon to have gone a-burgling
with a mate who shot Heavey and, knowing
the locality, escaped ; while Grenon ran into a
cul-de-sac and was caught.
* * *
For, if Grenon did not shoot Heavey, why
was he caught ? The man who shot Heavey
had to be caught; Grenon was caught; there-
fore Grenon shot Heavey. Besides, Constable
Long, the gallant officer who caught Grenon
with the help of three tramway employes
(and was promoted next day), is sure Grenon
would have shot him also if he could ; there-
fore, Grenon must have shot Heavey. It is
true that when Constable Long caught Grenon,
Grenon’s revolver was loaded in each of the
six chambers, while he only bought six car-
tridges with the revolver. It is true that G.
B. Modini, a Sydney expert with a life time’s
experience in fire-arms, asserts that Grenon’s
revolver had never been fired, because the
grease in the cartridge-chambers and in
the barrel was intact, while there was no
smell or mark of explosion whatever ; and any
man with a new nickel-plated revolver may
try, if he chooses, to fire a cartridge without
destroying the grease, and without leaving a
mark—which would grow more obvious with
time. It is true that Mr. Mclntosh, another
expert in fire-arms, and the man who sold a
revolver supposed to have been Grenon’s, also
says that to the best of his knowledge and
belief Grenon’s revolver had not been fired,
giving the same reasons as Mr. Modini. But
these things prove nothing. Constable Long
declares that one chamber of the revolver had
undoubtedly been fired and re-loaded, because
he smelt the smell of discharge. Two other
constables also smelt the smell, and say the
same thing. No one who is familiar with the
marvellous exactitude and perspicacity which are
the jewels in the dower of every policeman, can
for a moment question the constables’ state-
ments. Therefore (from the constabulary point
of view) Modini is a liar; Mclntosh is a
fool; and Grenon shot Heavey.
* « •
But if Grenon re-loaded his revolver, lie
must have had fresh cartridges, and he is only
known to have bought six. This difficulty
also disappears. For, fortunately enough,
Constable Long, wandering over the scene of his
heroic struggle, says he picked up several cart-
ridges (320 bore ; the commonest of all; sold in
bushels by every gun-shop in town) which were
the same as Grenon’s cartridges, and which
plainly were thrown away by him in order to
avert suspicion, when he felt himself beaten by
Constable Long and the tramway employes.
Therefore, Grenon must have shot Heavey.
If he didn’t shoot Heavey, why did he carry a
revolver ? He answers by spinning a cock-and-
bull yarn to the effect that he was frightened
of some men at Parramatta—a yarn which only
a lunatic would expect to be believed. Singu-
larly enough, Dr. Violette, surgeon to Parra-
matta gaol, says that on two occasions,
in two separate years, Grenon teas a lunatic,
or, at any rate, showed undoubted signs of
mental derangement; and, still more singu-
larly, each of these periods of derangement
occurred at about the same time of the year—
in September or October—at which Grenon
shot Heavey. But this proves nothing, for
what is there to show that Grenon was
deranged last year ? Only his behaviour before
the trial; at the trial—when he threw away his
life by refusing to call the evidence above sum-
marised ; and subsequently to the trial, when
he spent his time in making dough images,
“ obviously to create the impression that he
was deranged,” says the sapient reporter. But
Chief Justice Darley did not see his way to
protect the wretched man from himself ;
though expressly permitted by the Criminal
Law Amendment Act to re-open the case in


order to hear material evidence—like that
of Mr. Modini, Mr. Mclntosh, and Dr.
Yiolette. For, as Chief Justice Dabley said,
Grenon was bound for the gallows, anyhow.
So, no doubt, it was not worth while bothering.
The sooner he reached his goal the better.
There’s nothing in the fact that Heavey was
only wounded, not killed ; nothing in the argu-
ment that even under the savage Jewish code
life was only taken in exchange for life ; nothing
in the statement that the law which, in New
South Wales, hangs for an alleged attempt to
kill, with the intention unproven, is part of the
dregs of convict discipline, and is abolished in
England and in every other civilised country.
Even if innocent, a man like Grenon deserves
to be hanged for having a bad reputation. What
right, asked the Executive Council, eager to
get off to its junketing in Tasmania and else-
where— what right has a man to have a bad
reputation?
* • •
Though The Bulletin does not consider
capital punishment justifiable under any cir-
cumstances, it would like to be able always to
intellectually respect the decisions of the
Supreme Court and the Executive. The deci-
sion to hang Grenon this paper regards, in face
of the grave doubts disclosed by the evidence,
as a blasphemous usurpation, by a set of very
dull and commonplace people, of the omniscience
of Almighty God.
PLAIN ENGLISH.
Touching Tariffs.
The Vic. Tariff Commission listened last week
to the bitter cry of a British hat-importer. He
testified, not as one suffering from the effects of
local production, but as a philanthropist
anxious to abolish “second tariffs” and assist
the public. Lower duties would mean lower
wages for Melbourne hat-makers, thanks to the
blessed competition of cheap labor in England,
and thus the community (outside of the hat-
trade and its family connections) would be
benefited. It is the privilege of every importer
to have the public welfare at heart, assuming
the public to consist solely of other importers
and capitalists living on their means. The dis-
tinction between the public that this importer
speaks of and Victoria’s inhabitants in general
is very broad. If a reduction of hat duties had
no worse effect than a fall in wages at
the Melbourne factories, the country would
even then, according to its Legislative Council
doctrines, lose in money “circulation.” The hat-
makers, like a retrenched Governor, would be
deprived of so much aggregate salary for
“ spending in the colony,” and if it is good to
give His Excellency an extra =£3ooo to expend
in ball-room festivities it must be good to pro-
vide humble toilers with the means of purchas-
ing a few more household necessaries. But if
lower duties, in addition to reducing wages,
reduce local production and divert Victorian
money to English pockets, the country must
lose coin as well as “circulation.” Naturally,
the real object of the hat-importer who offered
his views to the Tariif Commission, is to benefit
the “public” at the expense of the country.
The duties he pleads for would permit of English
hats re-entering the Melbourne market, if not
as freely as of yore, i n sufficiently large
consignments to seriously affect the local mills.
In short, this importer, and every other de-
scription of importer, hankers after a Revenue
Tariff calculated to swell the Customs receipts
from goods that have to be paid for abroad
with Victorian money. It is an aimless farce,
this taking of evidence concerning well-estab-
lished industries. The witnesses interested in
foreign trade are unanimously in favor of a
Revenue Tariff, whereas the local manufac-
turers and traders who are independent of
Flinders Lane desire a prohibitive tariff on
goods that can be made in Victoria. After
hearing both sides, the Commission finds itself
left with nothing save the Protection principle
to consider. As regards goods which have no
immediate, or even possible, bearing upon
Victoria’s settled policy, the Radical members
of the Commission will advise a popular tariff,
and the Tories will advocate the blessed
Revenue Tariff, seeing that indirect taxation of
the masses prevents direct taxation of the
classes.
Deakin’s Apostacy.
Leakin', the alleged Democrat, was one of those
who voted at the Federal Council for the ap-
pointment of an Australian Judge to hear Aus-
tralian appeals on the Judicial Committee of
the British Privy Council. Deakin is an Aus-
tralian native, and has always posed as an ad-
vanced Liberal and an exponent of true Aus-
tralian sentiment. He has never done anything
of a definite character to help the Democratic
programme in Australia, but in a loose, vague,
unspecified fashion he has passed as one of the
main supports of the progressive movement.
By his action in the present instance, however,
Deakin has proved himself a fraud, a delusion,
and a commonplace lawyer. Australia doesn’t
want to send a Judge to England to administer
justice which he could supply of exactly the
same quality on the spot. It is dead tired of
the system by which the rich litigant may
ruin the poor one by dragging him to the other
end of the world, and putting him to several
years’ delay, and making him incur an enor-
mous outlay in travelling and law ex.’s, before
ho can get his case finally settled. Deakin
and his fellow delegates knew well enough
that the Legislative Assemblies of, at least,
three of the provinces would have thrown out
the corrupt and ridiculous proposal with scorn
if it had been brought before them, so they
arranged that the irresponsible Federal Council
should address the Queen on the subject, and
endeavour to work the lawyers’ job with-
out the people’s representatives having a voice
in the matter. Then, when the appointment
is made, and the salary of the appointee
is included in the Budget, the various
Parliaments will be informed, according
to the good old phrase, that it would
be “ ungracious” to refuse to pay. The Bul-
letin devoutly hopes that the people’s repre-
sentatives will be “ungracious” in this case;
every member who isn’t should be unhesita-
tingly rejected by the Democracy forever after-
wards. If Deakin and co. found it absolutely
necessary to address the Queen in a grovelsome
strain on this particular matter, why didn’t
they beseech her to establish a final Court of
Appeal in Australia, with jurisdiction over
Australia, Tasmania, Maoriland, Fiji and
British New Guinea, and send out or otherwise
appoint two Judges to boss the institution?
Then Australia might have paid their salaries
with the satisfaction of knowing that it was
receiving reasonable value for its money by
getting its justice more promptly and more
cheaply than heretofore. This scheme would
have contained all the necessary elements of
grovel, and would also have been practical,
business-like and economical; the other hasn’t
a single feature to recommend it to any intelli-
gent community.
In the Multitude of Councillors !
The Hawthorn (Vic.) Council last week dis-
cussed the minimum wage, and in the name of
Supply and Demand refused relief to some of
its wretched constituents who are struggling in
the deep of 3s. 6d. a day for a man’s wage :
Cr. Edgerton admitted that the 6s. 2d. paid in Haw-
thorn for tlie hire of a man, horse and dray was less than
a living wage, hut held that the law of supply and demand
must always regulate the price of labor.
Cr. D alley ; You forget that horse-feed is ever so much
cheaper now.
Cr. Edgerton: Yes, but the drivers get only 3s. 6d. a
day for themselves.
Cr. Smith : All the more reason for adopting the mini-
mum wage.
The Mayor held that low wages tended to lower the
community both socially and morally.
Cr. Ardagh said that since the council began paying
the 6s. 2d. per day for horse work the owners of horses
and drays found it impossible to get more from outsiders.
The harm done by this one act of the council was incal-
culable. In fact, men with horsesand drays were working
for 18s. a week, which hardly covered the cost of horse-
feed and repairs.
The motion for the minimum wage was then put and
rejected, only the Mayor, Cr. Barbour and Crs. Smith
and ardagh voting for it.
All honor is due to the tiny minority that voted
on the side of humanity on this occasion, but it
is almost a tempting prospect that 40 more
councils may rise up and call the minimum
wage cursed. Then the community will rise,
inspired, and enact one-man-one-vote for muni-
cipalities. The consequence for the swarming
miserables on the councils will be everlasting
erasure from public life, and from the pickings
of municipal office which they provide for their
own fattening. In Victoria the municipal
bodies have almost all proved arrant traitors to
the cause of Democracy. Every man with a
vote can put one nail in the coffin of the worst
form of treason.
Prorogued.
Another session of the Vic. Parliament has
been concluded in a violent hurry, and some
sadly farcical incidents marked its close. The
Legislative Assembly sat up, or lay down and
snored, through hot nights, for the purpose of
accomplishing reforms and economies which
were presently repudiated by the Legislative
Council, so that when the curtain fell upon the
performance of public business the tax-
payers were left lamenting a great waste of
applause. They had been deluded by phantoms
and cheated into admiring deeds that remained
undone. One very late and sultry sitting of the
Assembly was mainly devoted to a visionary re-
duction of the Agent-General’s salary. The salary
was cut down to =£lsoo a year, also the House
decided to inaugurate this very urgent reform
in the case of Duncan Gillies, a person who
receives several hundreds of pounds more than
any other Australian Agent-General for being
far and away the laziest member of the
fraternity. The retrenchment of Gillies
appeared to happen at about 3.30 a.m. A few
hours later the Council negatived this piece of
admirable legislation in the curtest manner on
record. President Zeal, an old friend of
Gillies aforesaid, failed to hear somebody call
for a division, and declared that the bill had
died without a struggle. It was practically a
money bill, but it was passed by the people’s
representatives only to pass away in “ another
place,” as the Land-tax had disappeared a fort-
night earlier. The Assembly decided to abolish
primage duties, in the interests of business
convenience and the poor consumer. The
Council quietly reimposed those duties at the
suggestion of Matthew Davies’s brother. “If
they were repealed there might be a deficiency
at the end of the year, and a consequent
excuse for bringing in another Land-tax,” said
J. M. Davies. He spoke transparent nonsense,
inasmuch as the primage duties were to remain
in force anyway until the last month of the
financial year, but the Council turned pale at
the mention of “ land-tax,” and another chicken
hatched off the Assembly’s all-night sittings
got its little neck wrung. A bill to prevent
the absurd lapsing of measures between sessions,
whereby much time and talk is annually
wasted, had been carried in the “Lower”
House. This, likewise, was dishonored by the
48 landowners, for the reason that a measure
affecting Proputty might be carried forward to
next half-year, and the Council would prefer
any such iniquity to lapse in the good old
manner. The first session of the new Victorian
Parliament began with a democratic roar and
degenerated into a Tory chuckle.

As further details come to hand the stor, --
the Newfoundland banking crisis grows more
interesting. Newfoundland is, at the best of
times, a poor, miserable little place with a
population of 200,000 souls, very few roads, an
interior region that is uninhabited and almost
wholly inaccessible, and with hardly any means
of support save fish. It is estimated that all
the cash in the province before the,crisis didn’t
exceed .£33,000, and of this over .£BO,OOO was
locked up in the fallen banks. When the
smash came everything went down with a run.
Two-thirds of the shops closed straight away,
and sacked all their employes. Nearly all the
hh-curiug and fish-dealing establishments did
Lkewise. The seal-fishery, one of the main
supports of the place, broke down at once
because the owners' of the seal-fishing fleet
were bankrupt and could neither pay for
stores nor get them on credit. The cod-
fishery, which is the other prop and stay of
the foggy island, is expected to do likewise for
the same reason. On a rough estimate, three-
fourths of the inhabitants were out of work
when the mail left. The church funds are mostly
gone in the broken banks, and even the means
of grace are closed for repairs. At the principal
orphanage in St. John’s the children were lately
leading a precarious existence on one meal a
day, because the banks have got away with the
orphanage funds also. The whole cash assets
of the Treasury—which weren’t much in any
case—are locked up, and in all probability will
never be heard of again ; the taxes have stopped
coming in owing to the general paralysis ; the
Ministry has resigned ; the hungry mob has
taken to smashing things as a protest against
the doings of the local Fat Man; and everything
is chaos. A postscript to the report sets forth
that the trouble arose through the “ depression
in silver.” Considering that all the specie to
be depressed amounted to the aforesaid
£85,000, the explanation looks improbable.
“ Depression in commercial morality” is amuck
more probable explanation.
♦
Q. Attorney-General Byrnes, at the Federal
Conference, carried a motion that Queen Yic. be
asked to call an Australian Judge to sit on the
Privy Council. Another legal hound on the trail !
But it seems quaint that at a gathering pro-
fessedly held in the interests of Australian.
Federation—which inevitably means thecreation
of a supreme Australian judiciary, whose deci-
sions in Australian cases will be final—even a
lawyer should have the brass to advocate
sending an Australian Judge to England to
decide those cases. What do the lawyers
want, anyhow ? Do they want justice for
Australian suitors ? or do they want to job a
big lawyer into a toney position at ’Ome, with a
big salary (to be a fresh charge on the tax-
payers), leaving more room for the small fry to
fight for the jobs out here ? Everybody knows
the brutal truth is they want the job, and don’t
care 3s. 4d. about the justice. For, if the
essential element in Privy Council justice is to
be the Australian Judge, isn’t the Judge’s
justice quite as good here as 16,000 miles
away? And what is the use of charging suitors
to take their cases to England, when they can
have exactly the same brand of law here at
25 per cent, less cost ? And if the essential
thing about the matter is the job, are the
Australian Parliaments going to permit it ?
o-
S.M. Herald has been asked to correct the
unfortunate admission that the new gag is
meant as a punishment. The use of the imple-
ment cannot possibly be attended with cruelty,
says Minister Gould ; and it is not meant to
punish, only to silence. These official dis-
claimers avail nothing. A man cannot be made
dumb by forcibly closing or distending his jaws
with a metal instrument without cruelty ; and,
if the instrument be applied in private by a
brutal or angry warder, the cruelty is likely to
be very great. Red-tape safeguards will be as
ineffective in the future as they have been in
the past. The use of the gag was abolished in
New South Wales in consequence of the
horrors reported by a special judicial com-
mission to attend its use—not its abuse.
For the use of the gag must always be abuse.
The form of it matters little ; the character of
the men who employ it matters much; and that
remains the same as ever it was. The point is
not that the new gag is an innocent instrument;
it is that in the hands of gaol officials the
most innocent instrument—authority for its use
once given—can be, and habitually is, con-
verted into an instrument of devilish torture.
The Herald, as the official mouthpiece, says
that the existence, not necessarily the use, of
the gag is absolutely necessary. This implies
that prisoners’ knowledge of what awaits
them will act as a deterrent. If the gag is
harmless, how will it deter ? In the opinion
of the authorities, the class of prisoners
whom it is desired to gag do not stick at
trifles, or it would not be necessary to gag
them. There is thus an inadvertent official
admission that the new gag is no trifle, but a bit
of grim earnest ; since even the fear of it may
be generally relied on to tame the stoutest
criminal. And if the dread of the gag is
enough to silence most prisoners, what must the
gag itself be like ?
That Kensington (Sydney) licensing case
shows one of the weak points of local
option. Residents of the semi - genteel
suburb, or, at least, a large proportion
of them, opposed by petition an application
for a new (in fact, the first) license. The
magistrate granted the license, and explained
that as the locality is now much frequented,
especially on account of the racecourse recently
opened, the travelling public and visitors have
to be studied as well as the residents. It
is evident that the hotel is for the conveni-
ence of visitors rather than of residents.
The resident can fall back on a well-stocked
cellar or a modest cupboard, whereas the
stranger is dependent on the hotel. Therefore,
it is unfair that the strangers’ accommodation
should be dependent on the residents’ votes.
The residents can shut up the hotel and get all
they want through the grocer or the spirit
dealer. The local option vote of a suburb does
not profess to stop the grocer’s cart from the
centre of the city. And if the local option vote
of a city ward stopped the grocer’s license, the
numerous suburban boozers whose “ reasonable
requirements ” were supplied by his cart,
would have no say whatever in a matter so
deeply concerning them. In more than one
sense, local option is a too narrow measure.
There will evidently have to be also local option
in (amongst other things) racecourses.
English Admiral Oolomb recently wrote in the
National Review that in war-time the agree-
ment which binds the “ Australian ” squadron
to remain in Australian waters would be so
much waste paper. Admiral Bridge, who has
succeeded to the command of the squadron,
said practically the same thing to a S.M.
Herald interviewer. Only a nervous Admiral,
he implied, would be bound by the agreement:
a strong one would defy it. Now, this obliga-
tion on the part of the squadron to remain
in Australian waters is the sole remnant of
authority which we can show over the vessels
which we maintain. Iti or but of Australian
waters the Admiral whosb Salary we pay is a
law to himself, and does as he pleases irrespec-
tive of the bidding of parliaments or peoples.
In the direction of'thfe fleet which we are taxed
to support, in the choice of its officers and sea-
men, we have mo voice whatever. The only
thing to show that the squadron is “Austra-
lian ” at all is The obligation to rettiain ih
Australian waters. And now two English
Admirals tell us That The agreement will be
broken ait discretion, and that “our ships”
may meander any where from the Mediterranean
to the Gulf of Mexico, without the slightest
.attention being paid to Australian protests.
Should England be at war, and the Channel
fleet or the China fleet be endangered, we may
whisfcle for our squadron. The Naval Defence
Act was indeed a triumph of Australian
cdiplomacy !
The Argus of to-day does not hastbn slbwly
like the Argus of the olden time, which cer-
tainly possessed a rag of dignity, tn the lead-
ing article of the 21st January it ‘roared like
this :
The Melbourne of to-day would hftve beeh the greatest
port in Australasia had it not been sacrificed to the im-
poverishing policy of establishing manufactures which
Ra\e ever been wealth consumers instead Pf wealth pro-
ducers. Every step we took downwards placed Sydney
two steps above us, until to-day We see that city tha
mistress of these seas, conducting the greater part of the
transhipment trade which was almost Wholly oUrs thirty
years ago. J -
But the commercial ‘editor put in a. quiet correc-
tion in his column the very next day. He
quoted the official figures to show that, despite
the bad times and the falling prices, the re-
exports of foreign merchandise had only fallen
from <£1,695,915 in ’B9 to .£1,567,727 in ’93.
the transhipments also had suffered in the same
better-than-expected manner. The commercial
editor arrives at the following conclusions
(l)That the transhipment trade to other colonies has
not suffered more than direct exports from abroad to
those colonies, and (2nd) that the orders placed with
Melbourne merchants from other colonies have fallen off
to a moderate extent in value, but not necessarily in bulk
owing to the fail in prices. ’
This forms a splendid reply to 'the bunyip-roar
of the leading columns. “ The attempt to beat
up a Freetrade rally by exciting a parochial
rivalry between Sydney and Melbourne indi-
cates the dotage of journalism, and the desperate
condition of the official Argus could not better
be typified. The port regulations and condi-
tions of both Melbourne and Sydney need
amendment; but the two ports should not and
will not be conducted on the pitiable methods
to which some modern journals have reduced
themselves.

Witness after witness appeared before the Yic.
iariff Board the other day to describe how the
clothing industry was no more than an oppor-
tunity for sweating—and the representatives of
importing houses declared in succession that the
protective tariff increased the evil. The fact,
however, is that tailors and tailoresses have
always and everywhere been a disunited and
weak-minded body, and the competition between
the sexes has been perhaps one of the chief factors
in the demoralisation of this class of workers. Of
late years the demoralisation has been rendered
more complete by the increased factory
provision for the employment of girl-labor at
nominal wages. Clothing manufacturers are,
as a class, the most heartless in the abuse of
human labor, and no fiscal system, whether
Freetrade or Protective, will change their
rapacity into decency. Protection can indeed
offer the localisation of an industry to the
worker. But, in a competitive system where
the worker’s helplessness is the" employer’s
opportunity, no other result can be expected but
the exploitation of the worker. The irresistible
conclusion is that the community must not only
ensure proper employment, but proper remu-
neration as well, and the establishment of a
minimum wage for protected industries is a
reasonable suggestion for establishing a large
body of workers on a humane basis. Protected
industries were established by the community
for a set purpose—namely, the advantage of
the community, and any policy or attituefe on
the part of protected manufacturers antagonis-
tic to the commonweal should be immediately
checked by enactment. Sweating may be a
puzzle, but the Minimum Wage is the answer.
Dear Bulletin, — Re parsons in politics, put
there by the Labor leagues. You describe
Smailes, M.P., ex-parson, as “the ghastliest
failure in the present New South Wales As-
sembly.” The system under which the ex-
parson was selected is also a ghastly failure.
Mr. Smailes joined Granville L.E.L. about six
weeks before the selection of candidates. Before
that, he was totally unknown in Granville,
being an elector and resident of Parramatta.
He joined the League, to use his own words,
“at the request of six of the best men in the
Granville L.E.L.” Two out of the six were
not members of the League ; the other four
were people whose vote was. the only
thing of value they possessed. The secre-
tary of the League was immediately inundated
with applications for membership by electors of
Parramatta, who, because there was no Labor
League in that town, were, according to our
rules (since altered), eligible to become mem-
bers of the Granville League and assist in the
selection of a candidate for whom at an election
they could not vote. Also, all the members of
Smailes’ congregation residing in Granville, old
and young, pursued the secretary night
and day to have their names put on
the League books. The League being thus
stuffed, Smailes’ calling and election were
sure ; and after his selection the majority of
those who joined for the express purpose of
voting for him never turned up at a meet-
ing. He was returned to Parliament, and
he owes his return to the unwearied exertions
of those who opposed his selection by the
League, but, after his selection, loyally voted
for him. The Granville League subscribed ,£l6
to pay Mr. Smailes’ election expenses; yet from
then till now he has never attended a meeting
of the League. He was requested to deliver a
lecture in Granville in aid of the widow of the
late fireman, Brown, and replied that he would
deliver an open-air sermon. His offer was
declined.— Edmond Dantes, Granville, 21/1/95.

SUNDRY SHOWS.
SYDNEY SHOWS FOR. OOMINO WEEK,
Her Majesty's “The Housa that Jack
Built.”
Lyceum “Sowing the Wind.”
Theatre Royal “Span of Life.”
MELBOURNE SHOWS FOR DOMINO WHS'S.
Princess s Theatre ... “Cinderella.”
Theatre Royal “ Aladdin ” (last nights).
Buou “ The Foundling."
“Sowing the Wind,” at Sydney Lyceum,
did excellent business all through its first week,
and at time of writing is starting on its second lap
with much enthusiasm. There is a pleasant old-
world flavor about this production which is re-
freshing to the eye, and restful to the weary little
mass of grey thinking matter with which man
worries through this world of care. Virtue in a
sea-green suit, and with a high concern like a
tablecloth wrapped round its throat, is a plea-
santer thing to look at than Virtue in a murky
black coat and an oppressive collar. Niss Noble’s
cackling maiden, whose titter is a work of art and
the finished expression of girly foolishness, looks
more appropriate in her white stockings and in-
visible shoes, and with her waist hauled right up
to her ears, than she could do in any modern
costume. Also, the elaborate, old - fashioned
courtesy—in these days, it seems, a lady courte-
sied separately to each person in the room,
and each courtesy occupied fully 60 seconds
by the watch—is remindful of a period when
people had time for snch things. Nowadays, a
bank could reconstruct, and convert half of its
deposits into preference shares, in the time occu-
pied by that one soulful ceremony. Brough’s
sour, meddlesome patriarch grows upon one with
longer acquaintance, and the moral that there is
no ass like the moral old ass with good intentions,
gains extra force every night. Also, Mrs. Brough,
in the part of the good woman who was brought
up by a lost mother and a hairless peer of the
deepest dye, and yet preserved her character un-
stained, is a noble improbability which this clever
lady makes so natural that no one really cares
whether it is probable or not. Upon further con-
sideration, The Bulletin is inclined to think that
the average audience doesn’t care much whether
any artistic character is probable or not. And,
upon still further consideration, this paper is in-
clined to think that nobody cares much about the
probability of anything.

The water-pantomime at Woodloch’s circus
proved an eminently acceptable show, and will be
repeated nightly until further notice. Over 100
performers are engaged in this entertainment,
which is suggestive of a comic insurrection in
Sidney harbour, combined with a Chinese inva-
sion and various other circumstances. The
equestrian part of the show still remains on the
programme, so that Woodloch furnishes a large
and massive entertainment at a very moderate
cost.
» • •
At the above show, on Saturday, the
rains fell upon the big tent, and turned its outside
wqdls into miniature Niagaras; and the winds
blew and beat upon that tent and whisked away a
goodly strip of its roof, gut the gap was covered,
a successful matinee held in the afternoon, and a
good crowd pleased in the evening. There are 40
male and female performers, 32 performing horses,
many wise and wondrous dogs, and monkeys whose
intelligence is such that the youngest gentleman
of them, when offered a glass of water, looks as
hurt as a Brisbane drummer would.

About the latter part of this week the
wildly-gifted James MacMahon reopens the pre-
mises at 148 Pitt-street, Sydney—formerly occu-
pied by the late lamented kinetoscope—with a
new illusion called the Haunted Swing. The
Bulletin doesn’t propose to give away the secret
of this mechanical contrivance, which the public
may, or may not, discover by experiment. Suf-
fice it to say that the visitor, upon payment of
the usual cash consideration at the door, is admit-
ted into a room and seated along with various
others, in a capacious vessel slung in the
usual fashion. Then he meets with one of the
most sudden and surprising circumstances which
ever happened to him in the whole course of his
chequered career, and he wants to know, in wild
amazement, where he is going to and what is going
to happen next. After that he departs a wiser
and more surprised man, and goes round the
corner to think it out.

Bland Holt’s “ Span of Life ” is still doing
its “last nights’’ in a manner which ought to
prove highly profitable to the management. The
Living Bridge shows no signs of decay, though it
has nightly to support the burden of Miss Hilda
Spong’s generous figure, with that of her stage
che-eild thrown in. On one evening, by the way,
either the lady’s nerve failed her as she crossed
the vasty chasm, or else the Living Bridge was
more bumpy than usual, for Miss Spong stopped
short in the middle of the crossing, and stood for
a considerable time with all her weight on the
centre mountebank. The fact that this trodden-
on person didn’t give by the breadth of a hair
under this sudden trial, shows that the bridge
waj3 constructed by a reliable contractor and is
thoroughly trustworthy.
** * *
The Bulletin rises from a well-earned
rest to state that George Rignold’s pantomime is
now doing its seventh week at Her Majesty’s,
and no change is yet announced.
Lord Yarmouth’s charity entertainment,
at Melb. Bijou, tasted until Saturday, by which
time he had got down to ordinary prices and
played himself out. The profits from his three
perfonnanses were considerable, no doubt, but the
young man might have turned his notoriety and
precious title to more account by raising a sub-
scription among the class of people who patronised
his show. One way and another, time, trouble
and money were wasted in feeding Yarmouth’s
vanity. A Government which prohibits, on pub-
lic grounds, an art union for a charitable purpose,
certainly ought to step in and prevent this outrage
on Art the next time it is attempted. The Bul-
letin says this after due consideration of the
Yarmouth matter in ail its bearings, public and
private, theatrical and social.
*• * * *
Yarmouth proved to be such a very bad
amateur actor that many people were deceived
into thinking him a passable dancer. He can't
dance at all, in the professional sense of the word.
He is nimble and light on his feet. The Earl’s
comparative proficiency at stage hopping leads
him into extravagances that are unwholesome as
well as ridiculous. He appears as a moth fooling
around graceful Miss Sadie Green, supposed to be
a candle. Gauze was hanging from his shoulders
and arms, and his general appearance suggested a
scraggy, hard-featured woman disguised as a pan-
tomime prince. He flitted after the candle on one
leg, practising a plain swimming stroke the while.
A flash of light at the wings as he made his
exit in pursuit of Miss Green signified that the
moth had met his fiery doom. Lord Yarmouth
took his part in all seriousness, and with a pained
expression of countenance. He didn’t seem to
feel his position even when he impersonated a
comic miller, in fancy costume, and sang “Knocked
’em in the Old Kent Road ” as though it were a
ballad of high life, instead of a coster ditty.
Imagine a long, thin chappie with Charles 11. curls,
white smalls and doublet, silver-trimmed cloak to
match—imagine this spook chortling in a minor
key, “Thought I should, haw! died.” Our
colonial oath ! the event might really have come
to pass had Harry Rickards been present. And
the nobleman was doing this sort of thing for the
benefit of distressed actors.
* # #
Lord Yarmouth’s “ serpentine dance” is
his least offence, perhaps, inasmuch as his legs
take very little part in it. The charm of the real
serpentine dance is in occasional disclosures of
female outline through the filmy covering. Yar-
mouth is not a base imitation of Mary Weir. He
is Said to wear Turkish pantaloons and other
clothes, but one can’t see much of the apparition
save the face, which is nosey and uninviting.
He confines himself to creating billowy effects
with two sticks. This he does very satis-
factorily, though a seven-foot automaton, by
the way, could do it much better. Length
of arm is everything in this mechanical
agitation of 48 yards of silk. As regards the
effective pictures thrown upon the drapery by a
magic lantern, if Lord Yarmouth were suspended
from a clothes-line in the centre of the stage ha
would answer the purpose equally well. Mel-
bourne sassiety will continue to hug the delusion
that a lantern slide reflected on an earl’s apparel
is a terpsiohorean triumph, in spite of the fore-
going remarks. But nobody will have the hardi-
hood to apologise for his attempts at acting. The
Bulletin judged him as an amateur in emotional
and farcical characters, and the sentence is unfit
for publication.
* * -316 *
The new comedy that was to follow Lord
Yarmouth’s outbreak is off the tapis altogether,
and on Monday “The Foundling ” came back to
the indifferent intentions. Possibly
Elton apd the co. will restore confidence in this
suspended farce, and carry on business without a
change of bill for a few more nights. Anyway,
the Dacres will not open their season before
February 16th.

Melbourne Princess’ re-opened on Satur-
day, a scheme of fresh colour and a dream of new
delight. The whole interior of the house has been
decorated and upholstered up to date. It is good
to be there. “ Cinderella ” in this gorgeous place
is pretty much the same show that Sydney saw
recently, and coming after “Beauty and the
Beast ’’ will be reckoned a change for the better.
Horace Wheatley’s clog dancing, for which he
won a champion belt, or medal, or first-
prize certificate, a dozen years ago, favourably
affected a vast attendance; also his storio-i of
MTntyre were favorably received. Martyn
Hagan, as an ugly sister in rational dress, was
welcome, and James Nome, who simply came
forward and produced a sweet tenor voice from
behind an orthodox shirt-front, executed his mis-
sion with success. Marie Luella is the prince on
the present occasion, Ida Osborne in the name
part being another change from the Sydney cast.
Miss Lucy Fraser, and the perennial identity on
roller sljates. likewise a ventriloquist and" the
scenic effects, all passed off without a hitch.
Finally, the audience rose en masse , and paid a
debt of gratitude to Messrs. W. and M, for
omitting the harlequinade.

The Royal pantomime has arrived at its
last week. Two performances on Saturday will
bring “ Aladdin ” and Maggie Moore’s long fare-
well to a close.

Harry Rickards opens the Opera House on
Saturday (9th) with a largo variety company from
Sydney Tivoli. The “ host of attractions ” is to
include H.R. in person, George Wood, and many
people who have either been absent from Mel-
bourne a long while, or have never gob there
before.
At Poverty Point .
Marie Elster has wisely made up her mind to try London,
where her beautiful voice is not likely to go begging.
There will be two Misses Hardy in the Bijou co. pre-
sently. Sweet Katherine, the native product, and Miss
Mabel Hardy who came along with the Dacres.
The “delightful ingenue” promised by the Dacres is
Miss Muriel Carr, formerly of D’Oyley Carte’s 00.
The Firth renewed their offer to Miss Leonore Orelli of
the name part in “ Cinderella ” when they decided to
bring the show down to Melbourne Princess’s. A good
concert engagement might suit this promising young
singer, whose rich voice has gained strength, even since it
was last heard in public.
Phil. Greenwood, the Firm’s poetic-haired secretary,
recently broke a blood-vessel for the second time. If the
doctor advised the usual “change and complete rest,”
Tub Bulletin hopes he sent his prescription round to
W. and M. to be made up. Amiable Greenwood seems to
have found a complaint which rapidly gets worse unless
it is chequed.
Down at Walhalla (Vic.), the other Sunday, a really
good concert by the Palmer-Beaumont co. fetched an
audience of, perhaps, 600 people. The result of the
collection was 4 pennies, 45 threepenny bits, 47 sixpences,
60 shillings, 8 florins and 5 half-crowns, about 400 visitors
contributing the sum of nix apiece. At a Melbourne hall,
where everybody is expected to put something in the
plate, a variety co.’s concert is about five times more
profitable.
Florence Young shortly joins one of George Edwardes’
companies.

The one thing evident in Lord Yarmouth, without
reference to Burke’s Peerage, is his blood relationship to
the Chosen People. The jphnnie’s stage-madness is not
less Jewish than his nose, eyes, and features in general.
Melbourne pros., who do the suburbs, complain bitterly
of the opposition experienced from local amateurs, who
belong to the different amateur clubs, and who play at
opposition halls on the evenings that are announced for
the pros’, appearance.
That is a strange taste which links Alice Burvett’s piano
recitals with the horrors of “ The Escaped Nun."
Marvellous, merry, magnetic Maggie Moore !
M ‘Donald, of the Argus, is localising the Princess
panto., “Cinderella.”
The nigger-minstrel biz. has become a mania with many
Melb. suburban children. Several Collingwood young-
sters nigger-minstrelise in a large shed situated in a small
by-street, and their charge for admission, all over the
“ house,” is an empty beer-bottle ; after the performance
the bottles are sold to a bottle-merchant to pay show-
exes. A number of Geelong children, who certainly
deserve the cake, gave a minstrel show on Friday night
w'eek in a dilapidated shed at the rear of the Terminus
Hotel to a crowded “ house.” Their only means of adver-
tising is with chalk on footpaths “ Friday night, at the
back of the Terminus Hotel. The greatest show on earth.
All other minstrels outdone. Doors open at 7.30. Com-
mence at 8. Admission; Front seats, Id. ; back seats Jd.”
The bill-of-costs in N.S.W. Attorney-General Want’s

Sydney Turnbull, the young Queensland composer, is a
clerk in a Queensland bank. In addition to his skill as a
musician, young Turnbull is an adept in what women-folk
call “ fancy-work.”
The production of “ Cinderella ” at Melb. Princess’s wil
necessitate the Firm’s arranging for two new pantomimes
next Xmas. As a rule, the previous year’s Melb. panto, is
exchanged for the previous year’s Sydney one, thus saving
a great expense.
“ Politics are dead here,” writes a Charters Towers (Q.)
man. “ Only a couple of hundred rolled up to hear Daw-
son and Dunsford unbosom themselves. A baby-show
on the same day drew a crowd of over 2000.”
Most of the London musical agents are Hebrews.
Daniel Mayer, Melba’s agent, is one of them. Melba
herself looks like a Jewess, but she isn’t. Mayer is the
man who made a contract with R. S. Smythe for
Paderewski’s Australian tour. It was never carried out
but some day, probably, something will be“ heard about
it. The Much-Travelled is waiting till the clouds roll by.
People would not pay a guinea nowadays even to hear
the Pole with the fiery hair, and Paderewski’s red beard
will have grown grey before they will do so.
Mrs. Bryer, on the night of her ben. at the Opera
House, gave a bangle made of Chinese lucky-stone to
Clifford Ferley, who had worked energetically to make
the affair a success. At latest dates, Ferley was sleeping
in this hard, heathen decoration. He slipped the bangle
over his hand easily enough, but in consequence of its
luck-bringing properties, or something, there was no
taking it off again.
Lord Yarmouth, who has a Hebraic turn of the tomme
that harmonises with his cast of countenance, is likewise
keen in theatrical business matters. He showed com-
mendable anxiety to keep the exis. of Melb. benefit per-
formances as low as possible, although, in his private
capacity of earl, he provided champagne for the company
at rehearsal. 1 J
The awfulness of the “Morocco Bound” failure was
fully revealed in Melb. Practice Court, last week. Miss
Edna Grace sued those responsible for £5O arrears
of salary, which amount, according to the lady’s state-
ment, professed themselves unable to pay. She had
applied for her passage back to England, and they
couldn’t give her that, she said. She was penniless in a
strange land, etc. It has taken Edna Grace about three
months to bring her case up to the judgment stage
owing to “appearances” by the defendants and the
Xmas law vacation. No real defence was put in, and the
Court gave judgment with costs.

Sophie Harris, says The Bulletin’s London correspon-
dent, has made a big hit in Wilson Barrett’s panto at
the Palace. Her legs are things of joy for ever and have
quite captivated Clement Scott, who predicts, with confi-
dence, that she will be sure to make her mark in comic
opera in England. She has made a fine debut, certainly
in London, if we can call the Crystal Palace London
After all, there is virtue in a good pair of understandings!
Sophie is “ a fine form of a woman,” as they say in Ire!
land.
A heavy actor in a Maoriland theatre got so very drunk
some months ago, that he was barely able to stagger to the
house about 6.30—n0t to apologise or to be pumped on
with a view of sobering up—but to guard his make-up
from his under-study and stop the show. With this view
he loaded two revolvers and lay in front of his room-door
defying all men to take away the props. His voice, which
resembles that of an angry bull in flv-time, soon brought
everybody on deck ; one woman fainted, others screamed-
the boss ordered him to surrender, but he said he would
blow, etc. He won. Finally a sub. was provided with a
faked-up dress.
Little Ethel, the wonderful baby of Woodlooh’s circus
has limbs and body of animakd elastic. She hangs bv
her heels from a trapeze 20ft. high ; holds the trapeze-bar
by her hands and does a double dislocation act which
would tear the limbs of an ordinary child out of their
sockets. Though she has been half of her little life a
public performer, she is as pretty and babyish as if she
had come from the nursery yesterday.
During the time that such strained relations existed
between Mrs. Patrick Campbell and manager George
Alexander, when “The Masqueraders” were on at St
James’s, London, Mrs. Pat. used to giggle at Alexander iii
the most critical moments. This was intolerable, and he
wrote thus to her : “Mr. Alexander presents his’compli-
ments to Mrs. Campbell and begs that she will not laugh
at him in the second act.” To which Mrs. Pat, replied:
“ Mrs. Patrick Campbell presents her compliments to Mr
Alexander and begs to say that she does not laugh at him
dm-i- g the second act. She always waits until she gets
home.” 6
Thus a N.Y. paper of Dec. 1 re the stage costume of a
charming actress who won many admirers in Australia-
“ln the third act of ‘Camille’ Olga Nethersole wears a
hall-drers, the bodice of which is kept in place by a pair
of pearl shoulder-straps. Sleeves there are none. Most
actresses never essay the part of CamiUfc until they are in
the neighborhood of 42. At that stage of the game it
would be impossible, not to say improvident, for them to
wear a duplicate of Miss Nethersole’s gown. Thanks to
her youth and beauty, Miss Nethersole fills the gown ad-
mirably, but, at the same time, the weight of responsi-
bility laid upon those strings is something dreadful to
contemplate.
With characteristic enterprise, Messrs. Williamson and
Musgrove have renovated and redecorated the Melbourne
Princess Theatre throughout at a cost exceeding A'3ooo,
and the re-beautified building was opened on Saturday
night with the burlesque extravaganza, “Cinderella.”
The renovations extend from cellar to ceiling 1 . The
decorations of the dome and the crush-room are very
beautiful art-works ; all the figures are hand-painted, and
have been done personally by Mr. Phil. Goatcher. In a
word, the restoration is so complete and thorough as to
render the Princess practically a new theatre. Carpels
alone have cost over £6OO, and the beautiful blue plush
in which the dress-circle is being upholstered must have
run into many shekels. Under the electrio-light, the
theatre glitters and sparkles like a palace of pleasure—a
dream-picture from a romantic fairyland.
“Billy Bind,” Sydney’s veteran theatrical manager,
whose decease at the age of 82 has just been regret fully
chronicled, was born in London on April 12. 1813. When
he finished his schooling he spent 16 months iu West
Africa, fighting niggers; afterwards coming to Tasmania,
and thence to Australia, where almost immediately he
became acting-manager of the old Victoria Theatre—of
which, and of the Prince of Wales’ Theatre, he was
subsequently lessee. He muained conned ed with
the latter theatre for a period of over 32 years, until it
was burnt down on Jan. 16, 1872. During this lengthy
term of management he introduced to Australia many
celebrated artists, including Barry Sullivan, the Dons, the
Marsh troupe, Bandmann, Lyster’s Opera Co., and others
well-known in their day. When Mr. Diud retired from
theatrical life, he took an hotel at North Shore, and
became an alderman and for five years mayor of that
municipality. He was a genial, hearty old gentleman, of
stainless honor; and the “ profession ” has never had a bet-
ter friend. Mr. Dind’s portrait appears in this wei k’s Bul-
letin. “Melh. Pro.” writes apropos: Billy Dind was the
most positively last of the Romans, unless I forget
Charley Burford. Billy carried Sydney with him, even to
Melh., and there never was a more Sydneyish man. What
a fine Turveydropism about him, combined with real
Orummlesian grandeur of presence ! But he was never
fraudy, and always conveyed the impression of having
well-dined. He was emphatically a fine man in h ; s day
There were two events in his life—the combustions of the
Prince of Wales’s. He never could make Providence out.
Billy must always have a grand vizier of the Sam Lazar
order; but then there was the appeal to the potentate,
who delighted in acts of mercy. He had the head, per-
haps, of Coppin, if you extract Ooppin’s mobility. Dind
never got beyond the date of somewhere about 1858.
Monarch of all he surveyed in the days when Australian
Thespians formed a close borough, like Buckstone’s Hay.
market Co. There was never an old man but Rogers
never a low comedian but Charley Young. The old man
was a mine of anecdotes about the recently-released con-
vict, Bertrand. The little parlor in the right wing of
Dind’s old hotel on the rise of the hill from Milsou's Point
was Kinder’s boozing-ground and afterwards the scene of
the inquest on his body, and thither the dentist culprit
used to betake himself to “ take care” of his victim.
A fiend, evidently anxious to study the phenomena of
starvation, advertises in a Melb. paper for lodgings where
theatrical people are kept.
Peacock, Vic, Minister of Education,
admits that he is heartily ashamed of having been
a member of the Government that created the
abominable Purification of Rolls Act, an instru-
ment that has enabled local Tories to club thou-
sands of Dempcratic electors. One-man-one-vote
would purify the rolls.
The postal conference has done one
memorable thing—resolved unanimously “ that it
be made a condition of any future contracts that
mail-boats be manned with white labor only.”
Now, let the Postmasters show they have spunk
enough to stick to their resolution, for un-
doubtedly strong pressure will be brought to make
them change it. The cheap colored laborer is the
protege of every Fat Man in the universe.
A recent fire completely consumed the
model prison, the old Government House, gaol
hospital and public buildings of that quondam
hell-on-earth, Port Arthur. In these days of
psychological spookery, imagination depicts the
ghosts of the old tortured victims of "The
System ” each being let out of limbo for one brief
hour to apply a blazing brand to their former hell.
Would that some fire-miracle would orcould efface
at once and for ever the hellish legacies of “The
System ” still visible in Australasia !
The Bulletin has received a long letter—
far too long to print—from “Jus,” controverting
the allegation that the evidence on which the
convict Grenon was lately hanged was unsatisfac-
tory. So far as this paper is aware, no one has
impugned the hona-fides of either watchman
Heavey or the arresting constable. The point to
be urged against Heavey is that he may have been
wounded by his own pistol and, in the excitement
of the struggle, have mistaken the bullet as com-
ing from Grenon’s. Or that it was a case of mis-
taken identification, the real criminal being still
at large.
The sea between Sydney Heads, last
Saturday, was so tremendous as to stop the ferry-
steamers running. Neither of the rival companies
has a boat absolutely fit to face the huge beam
sea which comes of an easterly gale. What is
wanted for the work is a powerfully-engined
whale-backed tug, with plenty of passenger-
accommodation and no top-hamper. Over and
over again steamers have been temporarily dis-

The Victorian revenue for January is
<£76,764 less than the badly-diminished revenue
for the same month of 1894, which means that it
is still falling at the cheerful rate of £900,000 per
annum. Carter, in ’93, produced his beautiful
Budget of Hope, showing that the public income
was going to rise again, and complained because
“fuels groaned enormous groans and prophesied
evil tilings. As it happened, the revenue fell
immensely, and when, in ’94, Carter brought in
his next Budget of Hope, showing another
expected rise, the House threw him out. Then
1 urner fixed up a baleful and pessimistic estimate
of revenue which, so far, is proving almost strictly
accurate. Turner can claim to be the first really
successful Treasurer the province has had since
the days of—well, The Bulletin can’t remember
the name of the last one.

Deposits in Vic. and N.S. W. banks continue to
unfix themselves. Most customers continue to leave
their gold in the institutions at call. Perhaps it is
because they don’t want to saddle the banks with in-
terest, and perhaps it is because they think they can
whip the cash out of a current account at the first sign
Of a financial storm. In the last three months of ’94
N.S.W. fixed deposits decreased by £1,367,733-the cur-
rent accounts meanwhile increasing by £1,111,829. On
the whole, N.S. W. hanks lost a quarter of a million in
deposits in the quarter. Vic. banks had a gain, on the
whole, of £76,000; while the fixed deposits decreased by
£511,055, the current accounts increased by £587,308.
These figures form an almost pathetic picture of the
popular anxiety concerning the fate of the banks in the
coming time of storm. Meanwhile the banks adhere to
the old polioy of drift. Sufficient unto the stolen steed
of yesterday is the locked door of to-morrow.

this kind the toughest and most unpromising assets
usually remain to the last, and very little hope is enter-

The A.J.S. Bank, it is now announced, proposes
to meet each of the ten instalments of the reconstructed
deposits in the same way as the first, by paying one-half
and renewing the other for five years, or so. The follow-
ing obscure and slipshod announcement also appears in
the report: “The directors believe that the amount
placed aside to provide for the losses upon the business of
the hank will be sufficiently covered by the reserve-funds;
this conclusion is formed after again quite recently con-
sidering the position of our affairs.” This apparently
means that the old reserve-fund of £700,000, or so, will be
sufficient to cover the bank’s bad debts and depreciated
securities. The half-yearly meeting passed off without
any explanation of the fearful and unaccountable falling
off in the profits, so that enlightenment on this point
seems to be indefinitely postponed—which is a pity.
There is nothing about the institution which wants ex-

Dear Bulletin, —The very wild-cat writer on
Trade Protection Societies displays both ignorance and
malice. If his assertion be correct (that the societies
grade the financial status of their subscribers according
to the rate of the subscribers’ subscription fees), how
long do you think would those societies last? Three
(ninths is, as a rule, quite long enough for any business
firm to ascertain if the information supplied by the
society be true or false, and it would not take six months
to ruin any Trade Protection Society which depends on
the accuracy of its reports were that society to act as
suggested. The very fact that two societies have existed
honorably in Sydney for between 20 to 30 years, three in
Melbourne from 6 to 25 years, and that these five concerns
have had, ail that time, the full confidence of bankers,
merchants, and the legal profession, gives your cor-
respondent the lie. And I may add that, to my certain
knowledge (so far as Melbourne is concerned), not one of
ithe three reputable societies there will take a “ bad egg ”
ias a subscriber at any price.—Vosnibara.

£998 was deducted for depreciation in value of boats, and
a div. at the rate of 6 per cent, per ann. paid for last half-
year, absorbing £342. This leaves £563 to carry forward.
Some shareholders thought it would have been better
policy to postpone the div. and add another boat to the

A great many unpatriotic Australians make a
point of doing business only with English or other
foreign fire-insurance companies, out of a childlike belief
in their superior stability. Some years ago, several Aus-
tralian firms, which had fire claims on a certain British
institution, made a serious loss when that lamented con-
cern declared its inability to pay, and closed its doors ;
and some others will meet a similar by-and-
bye. At least five foreign companies doing business in
Australia are exceedingly feeble and rickety affairs, which
would go under with slight provocation ; and 19 of them
are, by comparison with the two leading Australasian
offices, very second-rate concerns indeed. A little less of
that child-like faith in the solvency of everything that
isn’t Australian would do this country a lot of good.

Manly Co-operative Ferry Co.’s refusal to
amalgamate with the old co. (forced by competition to
reduce its return fare from Is. 6d. to 6d., to the
great gain of the public) rouses anonymous corres-
pondents in the dailies to viciously suggest that
“racing” should be prohibited, and that “safe and
proper accommodation should be provided for pas-
sengers.” The “racing” refers to the fact that one of
the new co.’s boats is faster than those of the old co.,
causing the latter some loss of revenue. The Marine
Board is satisfied as to the safety of the new co.’s boats,
and if the public were not satisfied as to the quality of
accommodation it wouldn’t patronise them. Fact is, the
sixpenny traffic is beginning to lessen. The new co. is

The average contents of the ore have declined steadily

Howell estimates there are a million tons of
oxidised ore left in the Broken Hill mine, which will

penses, or by a rise in silver, or a big rise in lead—both
remote contingencies.
Concerning the recent Bulletin inquiry for a
half-ounce mine there have been many more respondents
than mines. A number have been examined and found
wanting in the half-oz.—or a reef big enough to make
half an oz. pay. In three cases the owners or agents,
the latter always sincere amateurs, would have one
believe that a three, four or five-ton selected crushing
was a guarantee of the average value of the reef. Only
one correspondent knocked the writer off his perch. His
reply was : “ My father and myself have been looking for
30 years for what you want; a half-oz. mine in a good-sized
reef. We think we have at last found one and, take my
word, we intend to stick to it. We are now opening it
up.” When a mine is for sale it is generally a case of
“ closing up.”

On 13th Jan., a roll-up was called at Siberia,
Westralia, to investigate the alleged theft of BJoz. gold
and a silver watch, by a man in custody who, it was
claimed, had been almost caught in the act. On pressure
he at last acknowledged having taken the articles. In
his tent were found the two missing nuggets, one of 7
and the other of lioz., which were at once restored to the
owner. The arrestee, who then acknowledged having
hid/ien the watch in a hollow log, was divested of his
sh&ith-knife and pistol, and a rope having been tied
round his neck he was led forth in quest of the watch,
which, after a search of an hour-and-a-half, he failed to
find—whereupon Judge Lynch ordered him to pay its
value in money. This having been done he was marched
back to the main camp, tried, and ordered to hand ijver
l)oz. gold to Coolgardie hospital, and quit the field in
two hours, which he did. He is averred to be an old
offender. When he left Siberia he had about 250 z. in
nuggets. This is the first roll-up in Siberia, and, despite
the gentleness of the proceedings, it is hoped it will be a

return about 200 oz. Are many of the Coolgardie managers

than by use. But it is beginning to dawn on them that

At the little Vic. town of Briagoloug, gold has
just been found, in unheard-of circumstances, on the
Gladstone river. The gold is in appearance like nothing
ever seen in Vic. before. It has a whitey'-yellow look,
and is, in its native state, of low specific gravity. A casual
glance discovers the unusual color ; a moment’s handling
brings the second surprise at its low weight; but careful
inspection brings the greatest surprise of ail.-
The gold is in layers like the leaves of a book.
Of course, the layers cannot be readily separated except
here and there, where the edges are curly—dog's-eared.
Subsequent to its stratification the metal has, of course,
been under great pressure, and a piece here and there is
not much different to flattened-out gold from ordinary
quartz as occasionally found. But a handful of the pieces
as taken from the sandstone look like nothing in the
golden way. Furthermore, they rustle and rattle, do
these strange pieces, like autumn leaves or tinsel.
Reginald Murray and Secretary Howitt both
experience strange sensations in their geological hearts
when the subject is mentioned to them. To them the
discovery of gold in upper Devonian rocks is a new vista
in geology as well as in mining. This is written after an
inspection of the gold and in a moment of, perhaps,
enthusiasm, but it does seem as if there should be plenty
more upper Devonian rocks available for gold deposits.
Murray and Howitt are requested to immediately produce
more auriferous upper Devonian rocks. Australia wants
them badly.

was said about the mistake until the usual clean-up. It
was then found that the returns did not differ a single
grain from those of previous crushings! Those miners
are now strongly of opinion that the system of public
crushing wants looking into.

A party of squatters and farmers from Beeac
(Oolac, Vic.) district have purchasad a plant and battery
to work on the Bitfield Plains. Thei-r prospects are pro-
mising, but they know nothing about mining and are
making themselves miserable with the idea that every one
is endeavoring to rob them. However, touching-the Bit-
field Plains generally, Bulletin readers can safely look lor
interesting developments.

Thompson’s Stock and Shark Report for
February contains a strong reproof directed against those
“brigands of finance and company-wreckers” who failed
to enthuse, like other right-thinking persons, over the
magnificent prospects of the A.J.S. Bank. The report of
that institution, it says, shows “ signs of growing
strength,” and it is also solving the reconstruction pro-
blem on the lines it laid down. A certain amount of
assurance is required to talk itrthis strain about a concern
whose profits have fallen nearly 60 peir cent. In one year,
whose shapes have dropped 60 per cent, in the same time,
whose dividend has just been reduced, and whose direc-
tors, instead of solving the reconstruction problem on
the lines laid down, are already negotiating for an exten-
sion of time. Still, the necessity for “restoring confi-
dence,” no matter whether the confidence is well or
ill-founded, doubtless excuses everything.

A grandson of the almost-forgotten poet
Cowper is a nurseryman at Brighton (Vic.)
It is sad to hear that the fate of Aspinali
has befallen a gentleman who lately figured rather
brilliantly as a Victorian M.P.
“Reid, a babbling lunatic,” says Parkes.
“Parkes, a babbling gorilla,” said Carlyle. Parkes
is always nasty, but never original.
’Tis stated that the spouse of the ex-chair-
man of a certain notorious Melb. bung bank has
become the fortunate legatee of £70,000.
Frank Cornwall, famous for his. lengthy
and successful litigation over Samoan landed pro-
perties with W. M’Arthur & 00., is dead.
Parkes: “I’ve been longer Prime Minister
than any other man in N.S. Wales.” Dibbs :
“I’m the longest Prime Minister N.S. Wales has
ever had.”
Pastor Fitchett now only writes one leader
a week for the Argus—generally for Saturday’s
paper. It is easily distinguishable by reason of
its wealth of “extract.”
.N.S.W, Premiership has, so far, been
filled by four Englishmen, three Scotchmen, two
Irishmen, two Australians, and one (William
Forster) from the dependency of Madras.
The Girl of Yarmouth is of the same
family as Lord Hertford —Thackeray’s Marquis of
Steyne and Disraeli’s Monmouth —who, with all
his love for the ballet, would swear at a nobleman
in skirts.
Grenon, malefactor, officially butchered
last week at Sydney, had not a solitary correspon-
dent or visitor—not even a morbidly-minded
female to take him flowers. But, then, he was
grizzled, wrinkled, and uninteresting.
One of £ £’s early rivals, in Melb., was a
Dr. Flattery, who used to bill poetry of this
order: —
And many folks, of ills afflicted latterly,
Have been cured by application unto Dr. Flattery.
In the five divisions of Australia there is
but one titled Premier —Forrest; at the conference
of Premiers two carried titles—Forrest and Brad-
don—whereas at the Federal Council there were
four K.’sO. M.G.— Forrest, Braddon, Patterson
and Lee Steere.
The late W. J. McGaw, of Kooba station,
N.S.W., has left £82,550 —all to his wife. Dur-
ing his latter days he lived chiefly at Manly, in
“Dailey’s castle,” which he bought some years
ago, and figured as a beneficent supporter of the
local Presbyterian church.

manager.
After the Sydney Public Library, the
largest and best collection of works on Australasia
is possessed by Mr. David Mitchell, of Darling-
hurst-road, Sydney. Mr. Mitchell, a barrister by
profession, is substantially wealthy, and makes
book-collection his life’s hobby.
Andy Kelly, ex-M.L.A., now catering at
Wyalong, could, had he liked, have been lifted
into a brewer’s pub., in his old constituency, at
the close of his N.S.W. legislative career. It was
understood that he dreaded having to supply free
drinks to a couple of thousand voters.
Prof Morris’s “Life of Higinbotham,”
which was to have appeared some time ago, will
not be out for a few months yet. The book will
make about GOO pp., and will deal pretty fully
with the stirring political struggles in which the
late Chief Justice played sa prominent a part.
Gov. Hopetouu and wife decline to accept
presents on the principle which similarly actuated
Gov. Carington and wife, “ the indecency of the
thing.” It is said that when poor old N.S.W.
Governor Eitzroy w.as presented with a cheque for
£2OOO he grabbed “ the indecency ” with both
hands.
Even the “religious” Australian news-
papers are beginning to say that evangelist
Muckneill has left few, if any, real good Gospel
footprints behind, and that his “ meeshion ” ha«
been a spiritual failure. The religious newspapers
didn’t examine into the cheerfuller financial side—
to Muckneill.
Some people are predicting that S.A.
Premier Kingston will take a title when it is
offered him. The Bulletin presumes that King-
ston could have had a title long ago had he chosen,
as he is the sort of man whom it would pay the
Imperial party to bribe. He is the son of a
knight, but if he himself should accept a bauble it
would be time for The Bulletin to cut its throat.
The senior practitioner under the S.A.
Medical Board is Dr. J. H. Browne (brother of
wealthy squatter Dr. W. J. Browne, who lately
died in London). He was registered 4th Jan.,
1845, his name being tenth on the list—the late
Dr. Mayo (28th Dec., 1844) was the seventh. Four
physicians registered before 1850 still survive—
namely, Dr. Phillips, of Adelaide; Dr. Taylor
(father of Lieut.-Governor Way’s aide-de-camp),
Dr. M. P. Hayward, and Dr. Browne—all of
whom live in England.

Miss EFFIE STILLWELL, a Melbourne
Mathematician.
Miss Effie Stillwell, the brilliant young
Melbourne scholar whose portrait appears here-
with, is a gentle, unaffected little damsel with soft
blue eyes and shy dimples coming and going in
her pale cheeks. Despite her childlike appear-
ance, the sweet girl genius is “ nearly eighteen,”
as she is careful to mention with triumphant
emphasis on the “nearly.” Alas ! pride in one’s
advancing age is doomed to have a fall. At the
age of seven, Miss Effie began her scholastic
career, previously delayed by wise parental
anxiety. A year later she decided on becoming a
doctor, and in pursuance of this long-treasured
ambition, she will, in a few weeks, enter on the
Melb. University’s medical course. The interval
between seven and seventeen has been for the
enthusiastic student a period of hard work, illu-
mined by a series of successes, notably a State-
school scholarship, matriculation, South Mel-
bourne College dux-ship, Ormond Exhibition, and
just the other day the matriculation mathe-
matical exhibition and first-class science honors.
Though this sounds formidable, nobody can be
more unlike the popular conception of the “New
Woman ” than this unassuming Victorian girl,
who, so far, evidently has not realised that the
men deserve stamping-out. On the contrary,
replying to a question re her beloved South Melb.
College, where both sexes are taught together,
she gave it as her opinion that the boys would
outshine the girls if they worked as hard, which,
in that stronghold of football, they generally do
not. Miss Stillwell, as before stated, won this
year’s mathematical exhibition, but she regards
this class of subjects purely as a grateful relief and
relaxation from medical studies. Her mathe-
matical ability is said to be inherited from Mrs.
Stillwell. The maternal talents are said to have
descended in even more marked degree upon
a second daughter, for whom still greater achieve-
ments are prophesied.
One good point about N.S.W. Chief-Com-
missioner for Railways—he won’t have his men
bluffed by the legislative snob. “ Look kere,” he
said, when one pumpkin-headed terror of tram-
guards had made his hundredth charge or so,
“ I’ve had enough of this ! My men ean’t be
always in the wrong, and, in future, when the
guard tells you he doesn’t know you, you’ll just
have to take his word and show your pass, or be
put off the tram like an ordinary human being ! ”
An attempt is being made to get a British
civil-list pension for the widow of the late Pro-
fessor Pearson (erstwhile Victorian Minister for
Public Instruction), who has been left quite on-
provided for. Poor as Victoria is, and vicious as
is the general pension principle, the local Demo-
cratic-party might do worse than support a State-
grant to Mrs. Pearson, whose able and scholarly
husband did inestimable service for the country
both as a journalist and as a politician, in days
when democrats from the ranks of “the classes”
were so few as to be pearls above price.
Henry Louis Bertrand, the Kinder assassin
—recently liberated from more than a “natural
life’s ” doom in gaol on condition that he exiled
himself from Australia until the death of a certain
exalted personage—has determined, now that the
potentate is dead, to return to Sydney. This, on
the authority of private letters. Bertrand has
now, it is said, inherited considerable means. The
programme is in perfect accordance with one
unfolded to the writer during a gaol interview
with Bertrand some three years ago, in which
interview the reality of the existence of “ that
terrible diary ” was insisted upon.
The skirt-
dancing talents of
the Girl of Tar-
mouth may be ex-
plained on the
hereditary theory.
There is reason to
believe that he is
the descendant of
a line of ballet-
dancers. This may
be inferred from his coat-of-arms, which we clip
from the “Peerage.” The gentlemen at the side
are mediaeval Yarmouths in ballet-skirts. The
official description of these persons is gorgeous :
“Supporters : Two blackamoors proper, wreathed
about the temples or and sable, habited in a short
garment, or adorned about their waists and
shoulders with green and red feathers and buskins
gold ; each resting his exterior hand on an antique
shield azure, adorned ,/gold ; that of the dexter
supporter charged with the sun in splendour, and
that of the sinister with a crescent argent.”
There has just died at a Venerable age a
N.S.W. lady, whose Jong-deceased husband, an
overseer of road-gangs between the Hawkesbury
and M dtland, was one of the brightest ornaments
of the old penal days. A stock-story about him
was that a prisoner, who had just joined his parti-
cular iron-gang, was brought before him as he sat
in his “ chair of state ” —a seat cut out of the solid
stone—and interrogated thus; “Do you know
where you are ?” “ Yes, sir, at .” “And do
you know who lam ?” “ Yes, sir, you are Mr.
“ You are wrong. You are in hell and I
am the chief devil, and don’t you forget it.”
Story told by the enemies of Minister of
Labor W. P. Reeves (M.L.), who lately visited
Australia. He returned pers.s. Port Melbourne,
which is manned by a Lascar crew. The heart of
W.P.R. sickened at the sight of these dark faces,
and he was not seen on deck for several days.
When at last he ventured up, he held forth to the
captain on the subject, predicting that the day
would soon come when all ships would have to be
manned by men of his own race and colour. The
captain listened patiently and deferentially, but
in silence. Coming on deck next morning, he
found the Minister of Labor reclining luxuriously
on a deck chair, while a Lascar lad was humbly
tying the ministerial shoe-strings. “Ah,” said
Captain Richardson, “you would not get seamen
of your own race and color to do that! ”
Douglas Sladen tells this story. A certain
member of Melb. Club one day, some years ago,
arrived there so drunk that the hall-porter thought
it inexpedient that he should enter. After long
persuasion he induced him to go away in a cab
ostensibly bound for home, but the old gentleman
was on pleasure bent and ultimately got himself
locked up by a policeman. Whilst they were
taking the usual charge of drunk and disorderly,
the Superintendent happened to come in and at
once saw what was the matter. After he had held
a whispered conversation with the bobby the
latter went out and shortly returned with a hope-
lessly-incapable drunk who was promptly lodged
in the cells, the Club man being sent home in a
cab. Next morning the unfortunate drunk found
himself charged with being drunk and disorderly
and personating Mr. Thomas , of W
Park.
Another Australian writer has been dis-
covered by T. P. O’Connor, of London Sun :
During- the last few months, Mr. Frank Donohue, one
of the rising race of young Australian writers, has been
visiting us in London. Mr. Donohue, up to the present,
has been mainly employed in journalism in his native
country, and is regarded as one of the keenest and most
discriminating literary Critics of the Antipodes. His
visit to London was associated with a more ambitious
enterprise than mere work-a-day journalism. In the
library of the Brit sh Muieum he was able to realise a
long-cherished dream. He has “discovered” the real
pioneer and hero of Antipodean exploration. De Quiros,
in Mr. Donohue’s view, deserves to receive the same
place in the Valhalla of Australia as Columbus in that of
America. Indeed, Mr. Donohue has been much struck by
the many points of analogy between the views, adven-
tures, troubles, and final triumph of the two explorers. I
look forward with interest to the volume, in which the old
world history and figures will reappear.
Mr. Donohue, who was formerly a Sydney G.P.O.
official, began his literary career on The Bulle-
tin, and is identical with “Arthur Gayll,” author
of “ The History of Botany Bay.” He has of late
years been an esteemed member of the S.M.
Herald staff.

The death of ex-Chief Justice Cockle, of
Queensland (heserved from 1862 to 1879) saves the
province one of two judicial pensions of .£1250 a
year. The other is paid to Charles Lilley, who,
however, spends the money where it is raised ;
while Mr. Cockle left for England immediately
on the completion of his term of service, and his
very name is unknown to most Queenslanders.
The deceased ex-Chief Justice (who was “closely
related to Cockle’s pills ”) was a pleasant ol^
gentleman whose latter-day hobby was mathe-
matics. A few years ago he was President of the,
Savage Club, London.
It is related that a Maoriland potentate
once travelled some hundreds of miles per coasting
steamer with two friends “to hide Monty
Browne.’’ That steamer called in at seven or eight
intermediate ports, and it so happened that each
of five of Monty’s brothers was sub-editor at
one of these ports, while Monty was sub. at the
last. Towns were small, and steamers “events”'

POLITICAL
POINTS.
A politician is an in stitution for the pro-
stitution of the con-stitution.
Motto of N.S.W. Labor Electoral League :
“ United we planned ; divided we brawl.”
“The Conference of Premiers is mere
vapor—and very foul vapor at that.”—H. Parkes.
Three schemes of Federation are now on
the political racing track—the Federal Council’s,
the Premiers’ (which is Dr. Quick’s), and the Syd-
ney Convention’s.
The Bulletin does not want to see an
Australian Judge on the English Bench. Bub it
would cheerfully vote thousands to see some of
the English Judges on the Australian Bench.
The absence “out of bounds” of the
N.S.W. Attorney-General and his Deputy loudly
proclaims the fact that the Attorney-General
should be a civil-servant and not a political mate.
The Australian Ministry least representa-
tive of the people of i ts province is John Forrest’s,
and no surprise or disappointment should be felt
that it is least enthusiastic in the forward Federa-
tion movement.
Premier Kingston’s private views on
Federation are emphatic. “ What is the use of
Victoria asking S. A. to federate when she totally
ignores all appeals to settle the vexed disputed
boundary ? ” he said recently.
So far S.A. village settlements have been
a great success, and although one or two are very
shaky, notone has been broken up. S.A. Govt,
hopes to absorb the shaky ones in its Lake Bonney
irrigation colony, now in the initiatory stages.
The first and successful public auction of
South Australian wine from the State-supervised
depot in London marks a momentous era in the
history of Australia. It is the destiny of this
country to supply wine for hundreds of millions
outside our boundaries. The Prohibitionists are
g.nawing a file.
Premier Kingston wants Way to act as
Lieut.-Governor for at least 12 months ; but the
Imperial Govt, is obdurate and intends to appoint
Kintore’s successor next April. Awhile ago
Kingston said he would, under these circum-
stances, ask Parliament not to vote more than
Way’s salary of £2500 to the new Governor, and
now people are wondering whether he will do
this. Kintore’s successor will, in any case, have
to nav all salaries frc out of his screw of £5OOO.
London Daily
Telegraph— run
by Mr. Levy, who
c 11s himself Law-
suu —says that Vic-
toria is worthy of
having Brassey as
its Governor, This
is suggestive ot the
awful drivel on the
fly-leaf of the unre-
vised Bible, where-
in England states
in crawlsome terms
that it wasn’t
worthy of King
James 1., but it
would do its best
to live up to him.
James 1., by the
way, was the knock-
kneed man with the
huge tongue, who
seldom washed him-
self, and whose
liquor used to flow
out at each corner
of his mouth when he tried to drink
anything.
The Vic. Railway Department’s
circular requesting ex-M.’sL.A. to re-
turn their free passes without delay,
has brought in answers whose general
tenor is that the ex-members will see
the department further before they
part with them. Some ask to be
allowed to keep the passes as memen-
toes —and, presumably, to travel on
them. Some refuse to send them in,
on the ground that they have had
them made into trinkets for their
she-relatives. One politician, it has
been ascertained, sold his pass to a
publican, or else left it as security for
an orgie, and then got another on the
ground that the original was lost, and
now refuses to even return the dupli-
cate, though he has been long out of
the Assembly. The climax is reached
in the case of an infuriated person
who threatens to smash the Commis-
sioner “wid his fisht” if anymore
questions are asked. This gentleman
is understood to be in dead earnest,
and interesting developments are
anticipated.
The vexed sects which denounce the Sun-
day sitting of N.S.W. L.E.L. conference as pro-
fanity do not take into account the fact that in
France, Belgium, and several other countries, the
Parliamentary elections are always held on
Sundays.
Young lawyer Byrnes (Q.), at the Federal
Council, Hobart (Tas.), referred deliciously to the
“Premiers’ Conference ” as “an informal meeting
of persons in the same city.” Not for nothing
did Byrnes read for a year with Pat Real, now
J;udge Real.
1 Archbishop Carr, of Melbourne ; “It is
greatly to be feared that after a few years the
population of Victoria outside the R.O. Church
will be pagan.” The Archbishop takes too rosy a
view. According to the ideas of reverends a
pagan is a man who has no parson.
The now notoriously-clamored-for Duff-
Dibl a correspondence is to be moved for in the
British House of Commons—at the instance, no
doubt, of ex-Premier Dibbs. Though the N.S.W.
Parliament has ordered the correspondence,
administrative guile is suspected of keeping it
back under various pleas.
Henry Parkes declares that if there were
“in power” “four honest, capable men in Aus-
tralia, Australia could be federated in a year.”
Oh, that “ Hif! ” The mind’s eye can see the
possible honest and capable four, but, alas ! they
are “bout!” —1, Parkes; 2, ’Enry Parkes; 3,
’Enery Parkes; 4, Sirenry Parkes.
One N.S.W. ex-Minister boasts that while
in office he never pitchforked a relative into a
Government billet. The little things he found for
young men from the Clarence—tidewaiterships,
&c. —no man would give to a relative. In a
democratic community it is better to placate a
dozen electors than one kinsman.
H. : “ The Bulletin evidently has a
sneaking penchant for Rosebery. As good as
they make them, but altogether in a false position,
for Liberalism has no standing in the world nowa-
days. It is Toryism or Radicalism, and Randy
Churchill takes the Disraeli-fancied combination
to his grave. Rosebery sits on a branch, and
saws it off. ”
Though Vic. Legislative Council rejected
the Land-tax on the ground that the gap between
income and outgo could easily be met by retrench-
ment, yet it rejected fully half of the retrench-
ment measures sent up the Assembly, and passed
the remainder with intense reluctance. The
Council has got so used to being a stumbling-block
that it blocks everything by sheer force of habit.
Spake he by authority or by surmise ?
Ex-Premier Dobson (Tas.) told the Eederal
Council that the Imperial Government would
appoint an Australian Judge to the Privy
Council’s Judicial Committee, provided Australia
footed the Bill. All the Tasmanian Dobsons are
lawyers, more or less ; but how can Henry know ?
Chief Justice Dobson, by the way, lately visited
England.
Mr. M‘Court’s difficulties and resignation
give rise to another effort to put Mr, Angus
Cameron into the N.S.W. Chairmanship of Com-
mittees. Whoever gets the post, it should cer-
tainly never be conferred on a man who, having
re-entered Parliament as an uncompromising
opponent of payment of members, has the front
to at once seek a paid Parliamentary appointment
of £7OO a year.
The second and decisive defeat of £. £.
Smith for Mornington means that young Victoria
is sick of the old boom-time family-party type of
legislator. The Liberals, hoping to bring about a
healthier political life, didn’t vote for Downward,
who is the dullest of Tories. They voted against
Smith. And they did this because they associate
Smith with “God save the Queen ” and log-roll-
ing, two habits that generally run in double-
harness.
A QUESTION OF PROPERTY.
OLD Fellow (owner of property) “Say, could
you spare us a pipe of tobacco, Bigley?”
BIGLEY (owner of hoarding): “Why don’t you rim a
hoarding in front of that bloomin’ terrace of
yours and smoke cigars?”
Robert Stout, the alleged Radical of Maori-
land, says that, “from an economical point of
view, the Government advances to settlers will not
be of any real advantage to the settlers.” Stout
is a Democrat who, because he was lelt out of the
Democratic Ministry, is fast becoming a vicious
Tory and a cordial supporter of the foreign usurer.
The kind of Democrat who is only democratic
when he has a portfolio and a salary and is held
in reverence by the people, is a painful specimen.
Stout is that kind of Democrat. So was Griffith.
Stout is no longer stout. He is Fat.
The Argus on the scandalous attempt of
Vic. Assembly to reduce Chairman Fitz-Gibbon’s

PUZZLING.
C OUNSEL: “ Will your Honors tale a note of my objection?”
C HORUS OF JUDGES: “ Certainly not, Mr. Brass, there’s nothing in it.”

paper can act up to its repudiation of Conserva-
tism :
The vote in the Assembly was a cool piece of imperti-
nence on the part of members. .
The Board is entitled to conduct its own business.
Which means that the Metropolitan Board of
Works is superior to Parliament and beyond the
reach of the people. Anything is possible in a
Democracy —barring Fitz-Gibbon and the Argus.
Victoria might have been saved £2OOO a
year had the recent break-down in the cables
occurred a week sooner. It was an insinuation by
wire that Lord Brassey objected to the reduction
of the gubernatorial screw to .£5OOO that made
Turner ask Parliament to go back on itself and
add another =£2ooo instanter; and Parliament did
the wormy thing. After all, the insinuations
were deliberate Imperialistic lies, and Brassey
announced that he would be content with any pay,
but would have no haggling, so that the crawl was
uncalled-for. A movement for democratising the
cables is badly needed.
How is that among the many congratula-
tions tendered N.S.W. Railway-Commissioner
Eddy upon his reappointment, none has come
from the N.S.W. Socialist League ? Is it because
the Chief-Commissioner’s chief reviler has lately
fastened on to Socialism just as he has clung to
everything else likely to catch votes? Yet Eddy
has doii6 more for State Socialism than a thousand
of the dreamers. It is well for the true interests
of the State that the regime of intelligent railway
management has been made continuous. The
Eddy rule tends to keep the railway profits in the
hands of the people. Under “ private enterprise ”
the workers of N.S.W. would be made to sweat
blood.
N.S.W. Labor Electoral League’s new
dictum that, in all cases, the Government should
be its"own contractor is as visionary, in its way, as
the Single-tax is in its way. Some works are
better let by contract; others are better done by
day-labor; others are better left alone_ altogether.
The “way out ” for labor is to form itself into a
co-operative contractor, and then adhere to strict
“business principles.” Meanwhile, it may be
true that Government should let as few contracts
as possible, but to insist that it should let none is
to build up as hard and fast a quack doctrine as
that which declares that all countries should be
Freetrade. It is the expedient in business politics
that tells —the expedient, applied to a few under-
lying principles.
Nat Levi responded for the Vic. Legisla-
tive Council at the A.N.A. Rte luncheon (Melb.
Exhibition Building), the other Saturday.
Nathaniel had heard ringing cheers for Isaac
Isaacs’ attack upon the 48 land-owners who threw
out the Land Bill, so he put the best face he
could upon this job, and begged to thank the
country for applauding the Council’s noble con-
duct. Whereupon as much of the country as was
there present shouted “No ! ” The tough-hided
orator then fell back upon the fiction that 154,000
bread-winners are faithfully represented by the 48
land-owners, and he challenged any man to rise
and say that the Council didn’t reflect the senti-
ment of Victoria. The company immediately
rose, in spirit, as one man, and shouted some more
“No!” It next occurred to Nat Levi, M.L.C.,
that he was glad to be present on such a pleasing
occasion, after which he sat down amidst loud
applause.
In last Monday’s leading article, Sydney
Telegraph remarked
The cost of living being reduced, there is a propor-
tionate decrease in the cost of producing the things which
the squatter and the farmer have to buy. And so the
equalising process goes round. Take a few common
instances. A Sydney artisan who a few years back paid
£1 a week for his dwelling gets the same class of house
now for 12s. or 15s, Bread, which used to cost him from
3d. to 4d. per loaf, he gets at from 2d. to 2Jd. Heat, tea,
sugar, and all classes of food are similarly cheapened. If
he wants to take his family to Manly Beach, instead of
paying Is. 6d. for a return ticket, the trip costs only 6d.
Where he paid 3d. for his fare on a ’bus he now pays 2d.
These examples of the lessened cost of living in N.S.W.
cohid be carried throughout the whole catalogue of
human wants, which means that if the cash earnings of
the people have suffered, the intrinsic value of their labor
remains much the same.
The Telegraph here asserts that prices have
fallen all round during the last few years—which
covers the only period in her history when N.S.W.
was a protected province. How does this square
with the Telegraph’s other constant assertion
that Protection invariably Bends up prices all
round ?
Premier Turner (Vic.) describes a second-
class Governor as “a political adventurer seek-
ing to make money out of the position,” and to
prevent any “ sich ” making money out of the
position George induced Parliament to go £2OOO
more than it intended in fixing the screw.
Sydney Tele-
graph, which has
altogether given
up i ts feeble yearn
ings after State
Socialism, speaks
of “ the evil ex-
ample of the
Maoriland Gov-
ernment in using
the credit of the
wholabodyof tax
payers to obtain
cheap money for
farmers.” What
about the evil ex-
ample of the
N.S.W. Govern
merit in using the
cash of the whole
body of taxpayers
to carry the Daily
Telegraph free
through the Post-
offiee? Also, in
using the credit of
the whole body of
taxpayers to prop
up the note-issues
of the banks, and
to raise money to
build railroads
which only serve
those taxpayers
who live along the
lines, and to raise
money to improve
the navigation
of the Darling
(which the D.T,
cordiallyjapproves
of) when most of
the population
never even saw
the Darling—and
many other
things? Hardly
any good thing
that can be done
with the public
credit will directly
benefit everybody at once. Even when the public
money'is used to build a gaol the State can’t shove
everybody into it, and when it goes to pay the
Governor’s salary everybody can’t be a Governor
and have the same salary.
The Tory press —especially the Argus,
S.M. Herald, and Australian Star— declaim
for ever, with a melancholy sound like the grind
of a broken grindstone, about the way the land-tax
and socialistic legislation are driving population
away from Maoriland. As a matter of fact,
Maoriland, in the six years before the land-tax
was imposed and the “ socialistic ” regime started,
lost 17,000 people toother countries by emigration,
and in the three years after the present nefarious
system came into force it gained 18,000 from other
countries.
The Argus, exposing the superfluity of
Socialism, and demonstrating the results of
“ natural ” progress during the last century :
The wealthiest man in Victoria uses no finer library
than the working man has access to ; he sits in no more
spacious or exquisitely-planned garden ; he rides no more
speedily in tram or coach, nor more luxuriously by train
than the working-man may easily do if he so chooses.
And yet the absurd workman often goes hungry
and ragged and bedless, and sees his wife sacri-
ficed to disease and want, and his children
dragged up in ignorance of the true joys of youth.
Only the Argus could conjure up such a Utopian
picture, with the assistance of a free library
(closed, in Melbourne, on the only day on which
the working-man can make use of it) and a
public garden. The Argus is incapable of seeing
that it uses the beauties of the few existing
socialistic institutions as arguments against the
extension of the system.
THE TWO
GENUINE ARTICLES:
CLEMENTS TONIC,
FLETCHER’S PILLS,
IMITATED!
BUT UNRIVALLED
AND UNEQUALLED.
CLEMENTS TONIC ia a scientific chemical
food and restores the tissue wasted by the
vocations of every day life, is a prompt and
safe remedy for neuralgia, nervousness, weakness,
debility, liver complaint, dropsy and chronic
indigestion.
FLETCHER’S PILLS cure heartburn, back-
ache, headache, liver torpidity, dyspepsia, and all
complaints of the stomach and bowels.
These two remedies have been thoroughly tested
in all the hot countries of the world. They are
sold at a price within the reach of all people.
Evidence is forwarded free on receipt of name
and address that will satisfy the most sceptical as
to their virtues. They are sold everywhere, but
care must be taken that the genuine are obtained,
or the money and time are wasted and the disease
made so much the more serious.

Xjfuly Hopetoun was not present at the
prorogation ceremony this year, for the first time
since her lord and master has been Governor of

that another little Hope is expected on the scene

to Kintore, he who takes the Governorship at either
Melbourne, Sydney, or Adelaide, without private
means to faU back on, is “ a fool.”

Lord Yarmouth, in Melbourne, sojourned
awhile with Mars Buckley, of drapery-renown.
The local Paunch, desiring t > say something sweet
all-round, congratulated Yarmouth on his friend-
ship with a family that could advise him in the
matter of stage-costume!
# • *
The Girl of Yarmouth’s prattle to a Mel-
bourne newspaper Jeannes included some bold
nonsense. “If I were in Eng and not the slight-
est notice would have been taken of my move-
ments,” said the lordling to the recording flunkey.
“ Why should I be held up to ridicule because I
chose to act for the benefit of a charity?” If Lord
Yarmouth were to do in the chief city of England
what he has done in the chief cities of Tasmania
and Victoria —viz., appear as the bright particular
theatrical star of two consecutive evenings—a lot
of notice would be taken of him. Also, if any 24-
year-old amateur, gilded or otherwise, were to
treat any community to a performance of himself
in two farces, one musical comedy, and sundry
variety turns, all in the same evening, he’d be held
up to ridicule whether he were appearing for
charity or purely on account of faith in his own
entertaining qualities. The young man has hurled
himself before the public here in the character of
a versatile actor. The best excuse he can now
make is that he uses his self-sought notoriety for
worthy purposes. ‘‘Every now and again,” he
said, “confidentially,” to the admiring grovel-
scribe, ‘T break out like this, get a crazy fit, and
want to act. Nobody takes any notice of me at
home ; why should they here?” Pay your money
for the privilege of looking at the young man, but

The Bulletin finds that it was in error

An announcement that Lady
Brassey will carry Victorian hearts by
storm has been made _as a matterof
course. The appointment of a new
Governor to any Australian province
is always followed by the same story
about his wife’s heaven-born capacity
for making “ society ” happy. Of yore
it was customary for a loyal press to
mention that the vice-regal system was
really founded o;i popular devotion to
the mistress of Guv’ment House. A
Governor’s lady, it was said, held the
Australian ends of the silken-bonds,
and devoted herself to the beautiful
task of drawing a community closer to
the mother country, &c. This awful
fiction p .ssad slowly out of print, as
one c unitess or knitrhtess after another
sneaked away to Britain for the benefit
of her health, and, perhaps, forgot to
return; but the advance notices re a
newcomer are still pretty sickening.
The odour of the old “ gag ” clings to
them. As soon as Brassey’s name
had been cabled The Bulletin could
discern the “exceptional charm ” of
Lady B.’s personality in the morning
air. _ „

The hard times are being felt
severely by the Salvation Army. At a
Victorian seaport the Army band made
a midnight patrol, playing at different
houses, in order to raise money to buy
chaff for the army horse. The attempt
succeeded, and on New Year’s Eve
another sortie was made, the object
being the liquidation of the gas-bill.
This was also a financial success, so
there is no knowing what will happen
next. One or two irate citizens arose
in their wrath to shoo away the mid-
night music, but as the best-looking
“lass” was always put forward to meet
the attack the “ remonstrance ” gener-
ally ended in a contribution to the funds.
The suicide of young Lloyd Burdekin
(writes The Bulletin’s London correspondent)
was one of the most remarkable, as it was appa-
rently one of the most motiveless, of any recorded
in recent times'. He had, of course, abundance of
money: he was steady; and had, so far as can be
learned, no female entanglements of any kind.
His parents, I believe, and even Mr. David
George, of the B.N.S.W. (brother of the late
Hugh George, of the Argus), who stood to him in
loco parentis, thought he was still at Oxford. Only
very recently young Ahck Hay, of Cooloongatta,
and Alfred Nathan went to Oxford to find him
out, and were surprised that they could get no
trace of him. They enquired of everybody who
would bo likely to know where he was, and what
he was doing, but it seemed as if he had already
passed out of existence. He had failed for his
preliminary exam, at the University ; and this, no
doubt, must have preyed on his mind, for, instead
of trying a second time, he seems to have come up
to London and taken rooms in Jermyn-street,
whence he migrated to Walton-on-Thames, where
he has for the last 18 months been leading the life
of a hermit, knowing nobody and seeing nobody but
his landlady. He does not seem to have had a
single acquaintance, and what the many local
professed friends of his family were doing not to
have enquired for him, or shown him some atten-
tion, passes understanding. No doubt he became
morbid, and the solitary life he led induced all
kinds of imaginings. For instance, he thought
that his failure in his exam, brought disgrace upon
him, and that people avoided him for that reason.
He fancied, too, that he had become repulsive-
looking, and that was another reason for his
solitary habits. He was a particularly sensitive
young fellow, and no doubt these delusions preyed
upon his mind. Otherwise there was no symptom
of aberration, and he was, like most of his people,
extremely shrewd. The letters which he wrote
on the night before he died might even be
said to be clever (except the childishly-worded
one to his parents), and that to his landlady.
But, if we look a little below the surface, we see
that these very letters prove that his mind was
unhinged, for so carefully planned were all his
preparations that if he had not disclosed his in-
tention nobody in the world would have thought
otherwise than that his death was the result of an
untoward accident. Never was calmer delibera-
tion shown. He had called his landlady to bring
up his breakfast so that she should see him at his
dressing-table in the act of selecting a neck-
tie or some other article of apparel. VVhilat
doing so, he must have seen the revolver in the
drawer, with a boot-lace entangled round the
trigger. What more natural than that he should
try to release it, and that the weapon exploded
with fatal effect? It was a clever idea. Had
he simply made his elaborate arrangements, all
would have pointed to an accident. But here the
want of balance of mind showed itself, and he
simply defeated his object by calmly sitting down
and placing on record what he had done. The
story is a sad one.

Dear Bulletin, —One Melb. P.M. has the
worst points of the would-be judicial humorist.
The other day a man pleaded for leniency on the
ground that he was a stranger, meaning that he
had not been before the court previously. “Two
months,” remarked his Worship—“that’s the
way we deal with strangers.’’ Again, the other
day, a prisoner asked for a remand, as he had a
widowed mother for whom he wished to make
provision if he had to go to gaol. “We can’t
help it if you have six,” was the brutal retort
from the Bench; “you should have thought of
that before committing such a cowardly assault.”
And this was before the evidence had been heard !

A Melb. correspondent to The Bulletin :
Editor Bulletin, — On Jan. 18 a lad of neglected ap-
pearance was brought before a Meltu P.M., charged with
indecent exposure. Though nothing else was known
against the lad's character, he was sentenced to a month s
gaol with a flogging. A few weeks previously a middle-
aged and well-to-do city trader was brought before the
same magistrate for a similar offence and simply fined.
In this offender’s case there were no extenuating circum-
stances whatever; he had repeated the offence, of
which he was convicted on the clearest evidence, in the
presence of women.
The Bulletin isn’t surprised at these things.
Indeed, it would marvel greatly were the facts
otherwise. The lash is not and never was in-
tended for the backs of well-to-do city traders.
It is designed—let The Bulletin say it for the
hundredth time—solely for the offenders in work-
man’s garb. No black-coated, long-hatted man
was ever, or ever will be, judicially lashed. Die
hangman’s whip is for John Smith, the son or the
husband of Mary Anne Smith, the washerwoman,
who has no fine feelings for Society to consider.
Society never ties up the well-tailored Reginald
de Smvthe, the cultured blackguard with the nice
scented sisters and the silver-haired mother whose
silk dress you can hear swish yards away. Some-
thing very sudden will happen one of these days
when a workman with a square jaw finds his son
lashed by the Govt, man-butcher for an offence
which young Mr. Reginald de Smythe has just
been allowed to expiate by a fine,

Why do some Sydney stipendiaries per-

case, and say the conviction record has no influence
upon their decisions. If this is so, why do the
police secretly convey such information to the
magisterial ear? The other day a stipendiary
innocently told his court that he had seen a list of
convictions against a man charged before him.
Objections being raised by the defending solicitor,
it came out that the information was supplied by
the gaol authorities !

The “ good” people of

much shocked over a few
words from the benevolent

alleges, draw rents from
houses of ill-fame. Not many
years ago a certain famous

shining lights of the religious

Mrs. Chas. Bright now appears as editor
of the Sydney magazine Cosmos, which prefaces
an article on Stevenson in the Jan. number with
the remark that “ his untimely death a few weeks
ago, at the early age of 44, makes his name the
most appropriate of all to grace the opening pages
of our magazine.” Convenient and thoughtful of
Stevenson, to be sure. Butchered to make a
Cosmos article 1 But the best items in the
number are the prize love-letters, in which
gushing young ladies (names and addresses
given in full) show how brilliantly they could
coo and woo an absent adorer. One of them (first
prize, £2 10s.) tells “My dearest” that “pen,
ink, and paper are delightful adjuncts to-day,
for I can write what I can scarcely tell when
every word is stopped by a caress.” Another
(second prize, ,£1) contradicts this—tells “My
own dearest” that pen, ink, and paper ruin the
language of love; and, after remarking twice that
“love-letters are a mistake,” winds up with
“Write to me, darling, write, write, write." It
will be seen that Cosmos is loyally keeping its
engagement to “permanently raise the standard
of Australian literature,” while, at the same time,
affording interesting pastime for the dear girls.

A development in criminal tactics, which
Sydney police are carefully watching, consists in
what is called “ the game of substitution.” That
is, a member of the gang, not himself engaged in
the criminal exploit, puts himself in a compromis-
ing position soon after the crime is perpetrated
a id attracts to himself the attentions of the police,
confident that at the last moment he can prove his
innocence. It is thought by some that this was
Grenon’s relation to the Elizabeth Bay shooting
affray. The man who so acts is, of course, an
accomplice if the point can be proved, but this is
where the chief difficulty comes in.

A subscription ought to be raised for pre-
senting copies of Ibsen’s “ Enemy of Society ” to
the Scent Kilda Council. This honest body has
censured the Mayor of the puffumed seaside
snoburb for convening a public meeting, as requisi-
tioned, to call attention to the utterly insanitary
state of the place. Propputy, which has allowed
things to go to the dogs to save the rates, is
indignant that it should be known that the conse-
quence has been that Scent Kilda has become
unfit to live in. It is precisely the old story
again. The Mayor is Ibsen’s Dr. Stockman, and
the Council is the “damned compact majority.”

In that North Shore (Sydney) case the
man has just experienced a narrow escape from a
common risk. The girl was weak first and sorry
and hysterical afterwards. Queerly enough, this
particular woman was not a hardened liar, and,
under cross - examination, candidly and self-
damningly owned up to a voluntary liaison.
Which led to the accused’s discharge, but only after
he had been four days in gaol charged with a
neck-stretching offence.

“How did the Salvationists raise the
.£5OOO required as a deposit on the purchase of the
Y.M.C.A.’s Melb. premises?” The back of it
was broken by a penny tax—to purchase, or
build, a head-quarters—on every collection made
during about five years past.
‘We have a God who takes a special
interest in the Salvation Army,” says the last
War Cry. This, mind you, is not Dagon, or
Baal, or Tophet, or any of the gods of Hamath
and Arphad, or the gods of Sepharvaim, and very
evidently it is not the angel aloft that looks after
poor Jack Y.M.C.A., whose palace the Army has
just bought over the Melb. Young Men’s heads.

Another rude shock to “reverence” in
Australia. An old Cardinal’s hat was treasured
at Melb. Cathedral, on account of the mystery
attaching to it. Nobody knew how it came there.
It had been there longer than the oldest habitue
could remember, and was beginning to possess the
sanctity of a relic, when, one day, an old press-
man visited the place, and was shown the myste-
rious Cardinal’s hat. He solved the mystery in one
act. Many years ago he had attended a ceremony
commemorating the death of an eminent Cardinal,
at which a dummy coffin was employed, and a
Cardinal’s hat was obtained from a Melb. tailor
to put upon the coffin. The treasured hat was the
one the tailor had made !

Christchurch (M.L.) female saints have
out-gimleted their sisters in other cities. Their
newest move is to hide in dark corners near “ gay”

musician of a city church. The particulars of his
iniquity were forwarded to the high priest, and
ho was promptly sacked. Action for damages is

Mr. Gilbert Casey finds it necessary to
announce that he is the only authorised agent for
the Rue Australia settlement in these provinces,
and that any other person who professes to repre
sent that institution, or to send people out to the
land of hunger and wailing and useless regrets,
is entirely bogus. There is plenty of pluck,
at all events, about the man who will thus
announce that he is the only person within reach
who can reasonably be asked to explain away
that awful fiasco. The Bulletin is now waiting
A LONG-SUFFERING HORSE.
AUCTIONEER: “How much? How much? Are yeall done? Gents , that ’oss is a real
hummer. Why, he'll carry 20-stun and newer turn a hair; and a patient,
sweet disposition. In fact, a ’oss as’ll carry THAT ” (pointing to dude who
is trying his paces) “Will carry anything !”—(Passed in.)
to see an “ad.” from some forgotten boomer an-
nouncing that he is the only person who is respon-
sible for the wreckage of some bank or ocher, and
that any other person professing to have wrecked
that bank, and claiming the right to have bricks
thrown at him by the ruined depositors, is an im-
postor, and will be prosecuted with the utmost
vigour of the law.
It was after the third test-match had been
won and lost, in Adelaide, that the eyes of the
cricketing world were directed upon A. E. Trott.
The Englishmen before this had taken note of
him, and Peel, particularly, had spoken to a
Bulletin interviewer in marked praise of him as
a colt. But suddenly in the test-match the colt
eclipsed all records ; he scored 38 (not out) in the
first innings, 72 (not out) in the second, and he
sent ruin into the ranks of the English in their
second innings by dismissing eight of them for 43.
And no one was more surprised than the colt him-
self, and no one realises more than he does how
much he excelled himself by that great perform-
ance. He says he was never in better trim than he
was then; he was as cool as if playing an ordinary
club match ; the hard wicket suited him perfectly;
heoften broke back six inches. “A cricketer from
babyhood,” people will naturally say, of this fine
young athlete, 21 years old, 12st. 91b. in weight,
sft. lOin. in height. He is moved by the cricket
spirit; he would rather field for the opposition
side than sit still and look on. Besides, he has
never gone in for any other sport, except base-
ball—in the winter, mind ! and occasional
skittles.’ (There are 10 baseball clubs in Mel-
bourne 'how). Moreover, other sports don’t like
him; his first and last attempt at riding ended in
his being thrown against a tree, and, because he
is only a moderate swimmer, and was a little too
venturesome the other day, at Coogee, an
unusually heavy breaker caught him in its
embraces, and nearly mauled the life out
of him upon the hard and slippery rocks.
Facts are facts ; and as Trott has never indulged
in fencing, boxing, wrestling, rowing, sailing,
shooting, running, football, bicycling, dumb-bells,
or clubs, and as he is an Australian and must,
therefore, have a sport, and as he has put up a
cricket record at the age of 21, he has most pro-
bably been “a cricketer from babyhood.” But,
on the contrary, he most emphatically says that
he was made into a cricketer after he was 16 years
old. Till then he did not play in the real sense,
for casual attempts resulting in ducks’-eggs do
not constitute cricket. But five years ago Barrett,
of Melbourne, reasoned from analogy that as H.
Trott was a first-class cricketer, and brother to
A. B. Trott, it would be justifiable to experiment
with the younger brother and try to evoke
the cricket that was probably iii him. So
Barrett brought him to the South Melbourne
nets of an afternoon and taught him how
to break the ball, and encouraged him
wisely. The youngster worked with a will ;
bowling as he does now, three or four hours at a
stretch, and progressing favorably. Three years
ago he left South for East Melbourne, and is now
employed by that club as a professional cricketer,
and as a cricketer only. Last season his batting
average for his club was 19 runs an innings, his
bowling analysis 10 runs per wicket. Prior to his
sensational performance in the third test-match,
his highest score was 63, made twice; the last time
being in one match of this season, East Melbourne
v. Fitzroy. Two months ago, playing with his
club against a Mornington 15 he secured 14
wickets for 23. His debut in interprovincial
cricket was against Adelaide, and affords a con-
trast to his last big feat : Ist innings, caught
and bowled Giffen, 0; 2nd innings, 0 not out.
When batting, his right foot is on a level with his
bat at “block;” he has no pet bat of his own,
but he never plays with a heavy one. Bowling,
he runs about eight or nine yards before deliver-
ing. To bowl fast, he holds the ball entirely witli
his first two fingers and thumb, the ball’s seam
being equidistant (about half an inch, at most)
from each finger. To bowl his off-break, he gels
all the twist on with his forefinger, which, through
incessant bowling, is most markedly stronger and
stouter than the corresponding finger of the left
hand : he grips the ball so that the third and
fourth fingers act as a rest under it; the forefinger
comes over the ball until the nail ii opposite the
ball of the thumb; the thumb itself is at right angles
to the longest phalange of the forefinger and its
joint rests thereon, so that the upper part of the
thumb stands up prominently and is, in fact, the
plainest of signals to a batsman, who can thus see
the off-break coming before ever the ball leaves
his hand. This defect was pointed out to him by
Peel, but Trott has learnt to bowl that way and
he cannot alter it. It is a queer method, peculiar
to him as a bowler. He has no nerves, and has
never been to a doctor in his life. He is a teeto-
taller, but an habitual cigarette-smoker.

DISCRETIONARY INVESTMENTS.-“Mr. STEEL

“These Discretionary Investments undertaken by Mr. A,

than Sweeps, where the chances are 1000 to 1 against you,
whereas HERE the chances are all IN YOUR FAVOR.”
These DISCRETIONARY INVESTMENTS are under-
taken by Mr. Steel on ALL the Races, and he is so

Mr. A, W. STEEL is the ONLY ACPItEIHTEO

My Dkar Moorabinda—
At Admiral Bridge’s inaugural grass-party at
Admiralty House, the music was delicious, and
the afternoon a success from truck to keel-
son. i’lie Admiral makes a most intelligent
host. He glides about, and has a word in season
for everybody, or, at least, for all those people
who dofi’t turn in their toes and look as if they
got in through a gap in the fence whenever their
host makes a tack in their direction. Which
somehow reminds, me of a well-known “ society ”
woman ;(she was a beginner then) whom Gov.
Carington once strolled up to with the cruelly-kind
intention of having a little yarn. And, when H.
E. drew near, ferociously twisting his moustache,
the poor woman begun wildly diving into a back
pocket, from whence she produced and conspicu-
ously displayed her invitation-card. She evidently
thought the Baron was about to indict her for
trespass. 1
In one way, it wouldn’t be a bad idea if people
had to display their tickets-of-leave at these big
official shivoos, “ for their own protection and
ours,” as the shopkeepers say, as there are many
social trespassers who go poaching after pleasure.
I can onl£ recall one Australasian instance when
a whole flight of these interlopers got bagged, and
that transpired some time ago in a leading Maori-
land city, wher. the wives of the Ministry then in
office gave a big official ball, to which everybody
with a ball-dress or a dress-suit got an elaborate
invitation.’ S unething postponed the hop for a
week or so, however, and due notice was given to
the invited guests—a privilege in which the unin-
vited ditto did not share. You may guess the
sequel. They all turned up on the first date fixed
in a run of hired cabs, only to beat a confused
retreat five minutes afterwards. That little ex-
perience pretty well scotched the mob-nuisance in
Maoriland.
I was idly speculating, the other day, on the
unearthly dearth of engagements—mere engage-
ments that are, after all, invalid things, like un-
signed IO U’s or blank cheques. Cast your eye over
the marriage-market and you’ll find a most un-
promising glut of girls, and no reason for it, either,
that I can see. Certainly one very wealthy man
won’t allow his eldest daughter to encourage any-
body but an : Australian suitor, so her long adorn-
ment of the parental stem is partially explained,
seeing that her choice is limited to one continent
—but what of the gilded rest, who have the whole
earth upon which to use their powers of attrac-
tion ?
Whether the falling-off in engagements (I do
not clamor for more marriages—only let us have
tome guarantee, from time to time, of the matri-
monial good faith of Australian raarnageables)
argues that the New Woman is taking the place of
the old and repudiating the joys of double bliss,
is a nut for chaperones to crack, but it certainly
is odd that, although the “ society ” newspapers
reek with long accounts of routs and kettledrums,
and the fashions are followed to the last gasp,
yet such thrilling announcements as “ the wed-
ding of Miss Blank with Mr. Asterisk will be
solemnised on the onetieth instant,” rarely occur
to sustain one’s interests in the dovecotes.
Certainly women are like the goods in the shop-
windowsi which go so stale that the pedestrians
who pass every day rarely look at them, even
carelessly, at last. Like prophets, women prosper
best afar off. Only think 1 One of Sydney’s
prettiest girls married an Englishman at ’Ome the
other day. A musical Sydneyite went abroad to
study, and married en route. A banker’s daughter
took a Continental tour —met a man whom she
had known all her life in Australia, but under
foreign skies he took on a different aspect and
they married. I could multiply instances to
boring-point. Therefore, any maiden who feels a
little dog’s-eared in her native place is urgently
advised to pack up and flee to some happy isle
where the women are as unlike her own type as
possible—though I don’t mean by that to en-
courage a strawberry-blonde to make a bee-line
for Fiji.
I have been much entertained lately by the
spiritual airs and graces that the congregation of
a very fashionable Anglican church (under V.R.
patronage) lias seen fit to assume ever since its
“ priest ” cast off a fat vineyard and many hun-
dreds per annum in order to toil in a smaller field
for little more than one-fifth of the sum it
willingly contributed. It certainly is a charming
surprise to find a priest obeying a call embodying
such a startling reduction in perks, and his late
flock, though it mourns his loss, yet cannot help
feeling pardonably proud of having dry-nursed so
good a man. At the same time, it ought to be
remembered that it is frequently better business
to serve in Heaven than to reign in the rival shop.
I have a deep conviction that all imported
Anglican parsons in Australia (I may dilate
Ladies and gentlemen, remember that to
prevent a cold is much better than to cure it, and
by using the sanitary toilet requisite, “ Amykos,”
according to the advices on the circular wrapped
round the neck of the bottle, you will not alone
guard yourself against a cold, but find what a plea-
sant -Mid refreshing taste Amykos has compared
with other preparations in the market. On the
continent it is universally used by all who esteem
cleanliness Sold by all chemists, etc., at Is. 6d,
per bottle.
freely on this topic, you see, because no clergyman
ever dreams of reading The Bulletin) have a
rooted belief that, if they are good, by-and-by a
critical Providence will land them into a tidy little
job at 'Ome. An English cure is to the average
“kawlonial” incumbent what Paris is to an
American belle —a lovely place, where wealthy
spinsters never cease from troubling with crewel-
work braces, and the rude, sceptical Australian is
at rest. A place, furthermore, where every fad
gets a following of idle, overfed women, with a
spiritual yearning to suit all requirements, and
where the “ priest ” moves in the dim religious
light of tapers, and hasn’t to face a great glaring
sun, which shows up at the same moment the
powder on the choir-girls’ noses and the crow’s-
feet on the Lord s anointed. Yes, England is un-
doubtedly their ’Ome.
The terrible weather spoilt the test cricket-
match on the Sydney Association Ground
for the second day (Saturday), though a good
sized crowd turned up on Friday. Cricketers
must be singularly free from superstition—they
always start on that much-suspected day. Women
in what I call cosmea colors made the Members’
look like a garden from a little way off; there
was band music, too, a luxury much missed
at the other match, and the riotous display of flags
was as if every known nation had sent its particu-
ar banner to the wash and they were all drying
.ogether atop of the judge’s stand.
Talking about cricket—the übiquitous qualities
possessed by the relics of many saints are as
naught beside the übiquity of the toss-up shilling
which Giffen threw among the crowd, with the
somewhat fatalistic remark: “I sha’n’t want it
any more,” when Stoddart won the toss. I have
personally encountered and roundaboutly heard
tell of fully a dozen youths and one “lydy ” who
all possessed the identical shilling which Giffen
threw among the crowd. As probably not even
Mr. G. himself would recognise that nimble
shilling again, nobody is likely to be bowled out
about it; but in the moral interests of a young
and thoughtless nation, the next hero who casts
his coin upon the waters really ought to change it
into 48 farthings.
I have received from the composer, Miss Sylvia
Blackstone, a rather pretty gavotte—the “ Green-
oaks” —dedicated to Mrs. Hutton. The gavotte
is neatly and naturally written, and, without
being startingly original, is a most promising
composition. It is also easy to play.
As Victoria’s brand-new Governor-elect, Lord
Sunbeam Brassey, starts for Melbourne in Sep-
tember, he should just be in time to decorate
Flemington lawn on Cup-day. The most magni-
ficent rumors are afloat concerning the suite, and
Melbourne belledom must be tiptoe with expecta-
tion. The (youngest) son of a marquis and a real
earl are only a few 'Of the splendid creatures
whom rumor has attached to Lord Brassoy’s en-
tourage—on paper, at least. Let us pray that
when they turn up they will not be the same old
jerry-built Johnnies, very much gone at the
knees and ejaculating a feeble “ Haw ” at long
intervals.
I can’t help thinking that Victoria has occa-
sion to be deeply grateful that it is Lady Brassey
No. 2 and not her ladyship No. 1, who is fated to
preside over the biggest Government House in
Australia. The Lady Brassey we used to know
was one of the faddiest of women, and would have
kept Cabbage-garden Society “on the jump,”
what with ambulance-lectures, sanitary talks and
all sorts of improving pow-wow. The imminent
Lady B. is decidedly pretty, judging from her
photos., and looks like a woman to whom a
neatly-curled taupe was of far more importance
than a mustard-poultice. Though there is nothing
like a mustard-poultice (thank goodness !) —still,
too keen an interest in it is not devoutly to be
wished in the leader of a more or less frivolling
society. It’s like making a busy-bee leader to a
team of butterflies to have a Woman with a Mission
at Government House.
Apropos of Governors, it strikes me as being a
decided reflection on Eton and Oxford that so
many Australian professors of Shakespeare and
the musical-glasses now go about proudly display-
ing testimonials from his Excellency testifying to
the great improvement his lordship has made in
his study of the rule of thumb under Professor
Blank’s able guidance, and things like that—not
thanking the Dominie on behalf of the vice-regal
nursery, mind you, but on His Ex.’s own! One
Sydney teacher of French flourishes a testimonial
from Lord Jersey, and in a long circular makes
the somewhat astonishing statement that—“ His
Excellency Lord Jersey after a few months’ lessons
was able to speak with fluency,” &c. But, imagine
an earl with the run of the “’Varsities” only
learning his parley-voo in Sydney ! It seems
absolutely incredible. But it throws a new
light on vice-regal sufferings in the beastly
—no, I mean highly-enlightened—colonies. Many
and many a time, 1 expect, when a Gover-
nor has seemed to cut up rusty and refused
at the eleventh hour to open a new town pump or
something, the real reason of his absence was
because he was “ kept in ” to write out his verbs !
I sometimes think we would all like to lie down
in our little graves with our white hands folded
on our breasts and florins on our eyelids if it
wasn’t for the dread of that awful something after
death - the obituary - notice. In a Southern
“society” paper a gilt-edged pen-lady embalms
the demise of poor, dear Mrs. Dash at the early
age of 29. She was just going to marry again,
and her untimely death “is said to have been due
to eating unripe fruit.” •
Yours affectionately, Sappho Smith.
Cuming Gov. Brassey declines the
voted by Vic. Government to cover the expense 8
of his voyage out, “as he considers his Victorian
property will be benefited by his presence.”

The camel has come to stay with a ven-
geance in Westralia, and the local papers teem
with advertisements of mobs to arrive or on the
spot. There is unusual activity in the camel
market, and the port of Fremantle has lately
been very busy disembarking hundreds of these
ungainly" but useful beasts. Quite the finest lob
of camels that have yet reached Westralia from
India are 300 imported by Sultan Ras Mahomed,
of Coolgardie, which are now on sale close to
Perth and are rapidly being snapped up. Captain
C. D. Saunders is the manager for Raz Mahomed,
and is at present resident in Perth for the purpose
of disposing of the camels to diggers and prospec-
tors about to trv their luok.
SPRTING NOTIONS.
In the fourth test-matoh Stoddart won the toss,
and ssnt Australia in on a putty wicket; one of the worst
Ned Gregory ever saw. At the start this wicket was red-
hot and Richardson terrific. Hurling the ball with all his
force, he often broke back over a foot. These fast break-
backs paralysed the Australians; six of the front-flight
batsmen went down for 51. Iredale was caught and
bowled first ball. Graham was told by Miss Gregory —no
mean authority, by the way—to go in and hit; Richard-
son’s first ball nearly went over the fence, the second flew
to the boundary ; Graham knocked Richardson off. Obey-
ing a girl he bore a charmed life ; the English tried to
catch him out five times and failed. Had Graham fallen
at the first chance, the wicket, improving every moment,
would have enabled the English to make the stand that
was afterwards made by Graham, Trott, and Turner.
Young Trott astonished everyone by driving up 85, not
out; he, too, had been told “to hit” by Miss Gregory.
This Australian girl won the fourth test-match. The
innings closed for 284-Graham and Trott making
190. There was no play on Saturday, the second day,
for the rain poured so that it promised a drought in
Heaven. And on Monday, though the morning was fine,
with a bright sun and drying wind, experts, after examin-
ing the wicket, prophesied a one-innings defeat for the
Englishmen.
No team could look for victory on that wicket
against Turner, Giffen and the two Trotts. But the
English, who expected to make 150 in their first innings,
utterly collapsed. Brown went in third wiuket down,
and made top score —20, not out ; Briggs got 11; Stoddart
and Ward were next with 7 ; the total score made off the
bat was only 53. It was not the wncket that did all this ;
the Australian bowling and fielding were splendid ; Giffen,
bowling, caught the last man, Richardson, with his left
hand as by a miracle; Richardson stood still, staring at
this feat. Giffen brought the ball with him into the
pavilion ; one enthusiast offered him £5 for it. The Aus-
tralian party-feeling was rampant; there were many men
who w'aited with their hands ready to clap every English
mistake.
• ••♦**
Peel and Briggs went out with Ned Gregory to
inspect the wicket, and to decide whether a heavy or
light roller was to go upon it; the wicket, which was like
a sponge, might, if too heavily rolled, bring the water to
the surface. The second innings of the English opened
ominously. Brown, the not-out hero of the first, came
out and faced Giffen. Fourth ball his stumps were down ;
it was not the wicket that bowled that yorker. The
wicket was improving ; but the English were demoralised,
cowed by the deadly deliveries of Turner and Giffen, and
the conviction that to hit a ball up was to be caught.
Turner bowled too well, breaking the ball too much
and missing the stumps. He and Giffen placed their
field in daring defiance of the reputation of
the English batsmen ; young Trott stood slip,
the elder Trott point; these were the only men
to stop cuts, but the English never made a cut,
and out of a total of 59 off the bat only 4 were carpet-
drives, all singles ; Ford made 3of these. The names of
Brown, Stoddart, and M‘Laren were quickly hoisted for
0 each ; three wickets were down for 5 ; five wickets (four
of w hich totalled 0) fell for 11 Splendid as was the bowd-
ing, its merit was neutralised by the helping wicket; but
there was only admiration for the Australian fielding. The
Australians missed no possible chance, no finer fielding
was ever seen -the English called it an exhibition. Brock-
well made 17, Ford 11, Richardson 10 (not out). The
second innings closed in less than two hours, and the
English were defeated by an innings and 147 runs.

Lopkwood is a great admirer of George Giffen.
“ 1 think the test-matches would be one-sided affairs for
the Englishmen if George Giffen were not against us,
bowling with his unerring length and straightness, and
then going in after to make a big score.”
* * * *
One or two of the English are putting Giffen,
as a bowler, before Turner. “ Turner is not the man he
was.”
* * * *
Graham was put into the Australian Eleven in
blank defiance of public opinion, and when six Australian
wickets fell for 61 the aggrieved public began to feel that
the sth test-match had been won for the Englishmen,
partly by the Australian Selection Committee, and partly
by the treacherous coin which Giffen lost the toss to
Stoddart with, and threw away among the crowd dis-
gustedly. And Graham made 105 ! and gave Australia a
first-class thrill.
• * * *
Patrons of tile leg-stroke—Gregory, Moses,
Stoddart, Iredale, Shrewsbury, Lockwood. More leg-
strokes are made in Australia than in England : the ball
there often jumps too much.
• * * *
A side-light on England v. Australia : Usual
county cricket in England means playing matches 30, 40,
or 50 days running, exclusive of Sundays. Ordinary Aus-
tralian cricket consists of playing matches on Saturday
afternoons, and many an Australian batsman has kept
himself in form, tempting Providence and the laws of
digestion, by batting for a quarter of an hour in the heat
of the day, after bolting down his lunch. Often in Eng-
land a cricketer is almost glad to stand out of a county
match to get three or four days’ spell.
♦ ♦ • •
When Adelaide made the winning hit against
the Englishmen, the ball went among the crowd, and was
returned by a boy to Lockwood. Lockwood didn’t keep
it as a treasure ; he knocked the cover off it in practice.
« • * •
The Englishmen, admitting that they played
badly in the Adelaide test-match, say that it was chiefly
through playing too carefully “ for keeps.”
* ♦ ♦ ♦
Australian crowds are very partial, and some
of the barrackers (to their disgrace) insult the English-
men in the outfield. “ The crowd ought to be as generous-
minded as the Australian cricketers,” the Englishmen
* ay ’ *
Says Lockwood : “ Turner has bad luck as a
bowler, but, all the same, the Englishmen miss many more
catches in the outfield than the Australians do., I think
we are better in ground-fielding, though.”
* » • •
A bottle of soda bursting made it impossible for
Lockwood to bat in the last test-match, and the English-
men accordingly batted one man short. The glass cut his
hand so badly that it chipped out a piece of bone.
♦
By coming to Australia, the Englishmen get
three cricket seasons in succession. Several of them say
that they look forward to the next English winter as a
welcome rest.
* ♦ ♦ ♦
Turner, on being twitted by an old friend with his
seeming inability to score in some recent matches, can-
didly admitted his batting to be poor, but added that it
might he better were he given a more favorable place.
Being sent in about eighth or ninth man completely dis-
heartened him, and he didn’t care who knew it. Although
on the selection committee, he has to bow before the
captain for the time being, and it is an open secret that
he rather chafes against this. But his services in the last
test-match are acknowledged.
* * • •
Editor Bulletin,—lt is to be regretted that
De Maus, the Christchurch crack, could not have been
included in one of the test-matches. Although only 22
years of age he has been regarded the champion bat of
Maoriland for the past four or five years ; having made
highest aggregate of the 22 in most of the interprovincial
matches. For five completed innings against N.S.W.
teams which have visited Maoriland, he has an average
of 74. He is a successful bowler on sticky, but an expen-
sive one on dry wickets, and scores very rapidly off fast
bowling. In an emergency he is invaluable, being one of
the coolest bats that ever faced a bowler.— Phormi.

On Jan. 19, in a S.A. match—Mount Barker

Eleven of the 22 made duck-eggs.

This company is formed to acquire and work
that wonderfully auriferous discovery at Mount
Jukes (12 miles from Mount Lyell), Tasmania,
known as Harris’s Reward Claims, comprising in
the claims an area of 220 acres or thereabouts.
This discovery is so well-known that it is un-
necessary to enter into a lengthened description of
it, but it may be stated that it consists of an
auriferous lode about Bft. wide of hard blue lami-
nated quartz, carrying a large percentage of galena
and pyrites, and showing gold all over freely ;
estimated to yield 4oz. per ton. The lode, which
is a true north and south one, outcrops on the sur-
face, and has been traced for a distance of about
14 chains. About 300 tons of the rich ore which is
in sight can be quarried.
A small specimen assayed at the local Mines
office yielded loz. gold and 3oz. silver (from the
specimen, not per ton), and the whole ore body is
estimated, as above stated, to yield soz. of gold
j er ton.
Ore to keep a large crushing plant permanently
employed can be mined forthwith without expen-
diture on works, whilst there is an abundant
supply of both water and timber, and a battery of
10 heads close to the claim can te had at a small
price.
There is no doubt that the rich alluvial gold
worked in the immediate neighbourhood of this
claim was derived from this line of reef.
As an evidence of his belief in the mine, the
vendor is content to take a large portion of the
purchase money out of the proceeds of the mine.
If no allotment, the purchase money will be re-
turned in full; in the case of allotted shares, if
the allotment money is not paid within 10 days of
allotment the allotment may be cancelled, and the
application deposit forfeited to the company.

Bad biz. is the rule in Melbourne, and nearly
all firms are now paying all travellers by commission,
thereby increasing embezzlement, as men cannot live on
air when things are bad. Even lawyers are adopting this
system. Some of their clerks receive no pay, but,
to make the office look full, are paid commission on
the biz. they bring in. Apropos, the Vio. Law Institute
promises to be very busy at the end of the long vacation,
Feb. 1.

A remittance-man wished a bill done ; the bill-
shaver found representations 0.k., and, to keep the biz.
from straying, he insisted on the borrower having his
letters addressed to him, and on the right of opening the
one containing the remittance. This was agreed to ; the
consequence is that a bill is always current. The remit-
tance-man finds it so convenient to be able to run in and
getapound when he is short. And he is always short.
The shaver has lived on this one transaction alone for the
last eighteen months.

Of the precious metals (manufactured) slyly

The Maori land Government Loan Department
is now fairly started, and in 10 years or so some of the
pessimists of to-day will have a fair chance to decide
whether the scheme is a failure or not. So tar as present
appearances go the situation is something like this:
There are £30,000,000 lent on real estate mortgages in
Maoiiland, and the average interest is 7 per cent., ora
little more, therefore the community pays £2,100,000 a
year, and still owes the same old £30,000,000, which never
shifts one iota. Under the Government scheme borrowers
will pay 5 per cent, interest, and 1 per cent, towards
redemption of the principal, which will thereby be
extinguished in 36 years. Therefore, if the whole mort-
yaje business of the country can be gradually absorbed
by'the State, or—what is the same thing—if the private
lender can be forced down to the State’s terras, the
country will pay £1,800,000 a year for principal and in-
terest instead of £2,100,000 for interest alone, and in 36
years the saving to the community will he a small trifle of
£10,000,000. Tub Bulletin has remarked the same thing
before, but out of deference to a slow and thick-headed
community which absorbs new ideas very gradually it
hereby states it all qver again, to impress upon Australians
the necessity for trying a similar experiment.
Just now applications for loans are pouring in
on the Department faster than they can be dealt with.
This effectually extinguishes the Tory assertion that the
country doesn’t want the new system, isn’t interested in
it, and feels that it is much better off without it. To the
other class of pessimists wdro allege that the Department
will go broke by-and-bye through making excessive
advances which the security won’t be suffh ient to cover
when the inevitable depression comes along, it is only
necessary to point out that the State is going to take
much less risk in the matter than the average private
lender. The ordinary Corporation lends £lOOO on land
worth £l5OO, and when a slump cmnes, say ten years
hence, and the land is only worth £9OO, a good part < I
its principal is gone. The State insist son get ling back its
principal by instalments, and when the same slump
arrives its £lOOO loan is reduced to about £877, and it is
still covered. Moreover, in bad times a man with a £lOOO
mortgage at 7 per cent, often throws up the game, while
the one with a similar liability at 5 per cent, pulls
through. Altogether the State Loan Department will be
the safest, as well as the cheapest, money-lending concern
in Maoriland. Meanwhile, many private lenders have
reduced their rates from 7 or 7J to 5 per cent, in order to
compete with the Givernment office, and already the
mortgagor feels considerably better.

The practice of forwarding Melb. bankrupt

A “good” firm of accountants has lost the
periodical audit of a large firm whose head office is in
Europe. The latter firm has a capable book keeper, who
was surprised at the lightning rapidity of the audits. To
lest their value, a thousand-pounds error was purposely
made. It pissed the auditors successfully, the head office
was apprised of the test, and received the usual report
from the auditing firm, whose services were at once dis-
pensed with.

The Vic. annual return of insolvencies, &c., for
’94, omits to state the amount realised from assets,
amount distributed to creditors, amount mopped up in
ex.’s. It makes no mention of any officials who have gone
bung, having embezzled moneys belonging to estates in
their care ; no mention of any official fr< m whose office no
estate ever paid a div. The return even ignores the case
of the official, who, having “blown” the trust-funds,
called a meeting of his creditors, who were chiefly the
creditors of the estates in his hands.

A sweet little creature had her place nicely fur-

T.P. firm is met with a claim for rent for that term, plus
the time Flossie has been in, and is confronted with a
proper agreement bearing correct dates. Flossie’s domes-
tic arrangements will remain undisturbed. Thus do the
T.P. people gain another wrinkle.
Ed. Bulletin,—From the Adelaide Observer,
22nd. Dec., '94 :—“ Coolgardie, December 17.—Mr. W. B.
Wilson has returned from a visit to the Menziea line of
country, flu had a novel experience when crossing the
lake beyond the Ninety Mile. A thundershower had
fallen just before they reached the lake, which is seven
miles across. The salt water lies a foot or two below the
surface. The rain had quickly converted the top of the
lake into a slippery mass on which the horses could
scarcely keep their feet, and all the party had to walk the
whole distance. They covered most of the seven m.'ea
skating on the perfectly smooth surface of the lake.
The lake referred to is like all the other salt lakes here, ,
parched in dry weather and intensely boggy after a
shower. I crossed the above lake half an hour before
Wilson’s party, and it took both men and camels all their
time to lift one foot out of the mud before placing the
other one down. Where the skating came in 1 fail to
understand.— Prospector.

If it were sought to oust the cement-workers at
Hannan’s from their ground on the plea that cement is
not alluvial hut reef, that pha would emphatically not do;
for cement isn’t reef, but alluvial pure and simple. The
people who seek to oust the cement-workers, and mono-
polise their ground, claim that the reeling-leases issued for
the ground having been approved, the present cement-
workers must quit—that, in fact, it is too late for the
working miners to argue the matter. The issue of reef-
ing-leases for alluvial gi ound shouldn’t hold good under
any circumstances, and Tub Bulletin is glad to see a
wire stating that the alluvial men are to retain possession.

Castlemaine .. .. 64,886
Ararat .. .. 27,590
Gippsland .. .. 66,289
673,679
The total for the province shows an increase on a similar
estimate for ’93 of 25530 z. The districts showing a
decrease are: Ballarat, 13,0000 z. ; Bendigo, 34,0000 z. ;
Castlemaine, 600 oz,; while the increases are: Beech-
worth, 18,4000 z. ; Maryboro’, 14,0000 z. ; Gippsland,
13,0000 z. ; Ararat, 46000 z. The Mining Registrars are
only completely in touch with company mining, the
statistics of individual and private effort not being avail-
able to them. The gross amount of their error is indi-
cated by the Mint returns concerning Vic. gold :
Amount minted. Amount “ estimated.”

The Australian Gold Recovery Company are
acting sensibly at last by erecting a 5-ton cyanide plant,
at (he Austral Otis Company’s ore-treating works, for the
practical treatment of parcels of ore. The practical
management of the Gold Recovery Company now being
in the hands of the well-known American metallurgist,
Mr. Louis Jaunin, jun., recently editor of the Mining and
Engineering Journal of New York, brisk operations will
probably result, providing the validity of the company’s
patent be upheld.*
The accompanying portrait represents the
countenance of Mr. B. Horwitz, the principal
representative of the New York Equitable, who
claims to be the boss life-assurance canvasser of
Australia. People who know Mr. Horwitz, and
have narrowly escaped being insured by him, all
describe him as the most persuasive individual in
his profession. He is a man who does business on
a huge scale, and lays for <£lo,ooo and .£20,000
proposals. On a recent visit to Adelaide he took
the biggest insurance ever effected on a single life
in that province, and most persons who are
insured for very large amounts owe the circum-
stance to the same bland and pressing gentle
Mr. B. HORWITZ.
man. When Dunn, the Wealth of Nations man,
returned to Sydney, Mr. Horwitz gently took
possession of him in the street, led him into
the Equitable office, and took his life there and
then to the extent of 10,000. The much-adver-
tised prospector was a good advertisement for the
man who captured him, and nearly every agent
in Sydney now claims to be the person who
insured Dunn. Mr. Horwitz is an Australian by
birth, a man of no particular age, an amateur con-
juror and thought-reader, and a man of many mis-
cellaneous accomplishments. Also, he is a living
proof of The Bulletin’s theory that fat is stored-
up energy, and that the race in this world is
mo.-tly to the stout.
Honesty in a patent-medicine man may be
anomalous, yet it exists. How frequently does
the physic-vendor extol his bolus as an infallible
cure for all human ills ; how seldom does he
frankly admit that if misapplied his remedies will
fail? Yet there are these exceptions and Mr.
John Francis Taylor, senr., is one of them. Five
years ago this gentleman, while conducting a
chemist’s business in an English midland town,
had his attention drawn by an old gamekeeper to
a remedy he had discovered for piles. Mr. Tay-
lor tested the simple recipe, found its results
marvellous, and finally registered it under the
name of the Keeper pill. After the trouble of
obtaining the natural ingredients in sufficiently
largo quantities had been overcome, Mr. Taylor
launched himself in London and founded his
present large business with very satisfactory
results. Nor, when prosperity set in, was the old
gamekeeper forgotten. Later, when it was found
that haemorrhoids were often complicated with
liver troubles, the company perfected the Keeper
Liver Pill, the success of which has also been
phenomenal. Lastly, the Keeper Health Pill
completes a trio of remedies which, while they
will unfailingly do all they profess, are not to be
regarded as universal panaceas, nor as specifics in
any direction beyond the sphere for which they
were designed.*

GREAT SHIPMENT OF
CAMELS!
JUST ARRIVED.
Now on View near Perth.
Pack & Biding Camels of the host Breed,
KHARAN,
From
BELUCHISTAN, and
AFGHANISTAN.
Most reliable for carrying and travelling purposes,
unsurpassed by any hitherto imported from India
—real beauties.
These camels are now at Lime Cliff Paddock,
about 2J miles from Subiaco and 3 miles from
Claremont, where they will remain for three
weeks to undergo the necessary quarantine regu-
lations.
They are undergoing one month’s quarantine,
during which period they will be fed on good,
strengthening food, and no expense will be spared.
These are not Calcutta camels—or, rather, those
that are known as such —but the real Hill breed ;
accustomed to feed on bushes and grass identical
with those of Western Australia; as only used by
the Army Commissariat Department of India,
consequently they can be thoroughly recom-
mended. They are directly shipped from Kurra-
chee, the nearest seaport to Kharan, Beluchistan
and Afghanistan.
The s.s. Claverley, a first-class steamer, giving
comfortable accommodation to 400 camels, was
chartered for the special purpose of bringing from
Kurrachee these 320 camels. All these camels are
in good condition, as we have taken great trouble,
no expense having been spared by Messrs. D. and
J. Fowler on our behalf.
Diggers and Prospectors are
invited to deal at once.
All telegrams and letters should be addressed
to meat “Criterion Hotel, Perth,” until further
notice.

Bankers: Union Bank, Coolgardie.
N.B. —As these camels are from a cool part of
the East, they will by the time they leave quaran-
tine be in magnificent condition. I insert this as
Indian camels are considered useless by some of
the judges in Coolgardie. This may apply to the
Calcutta camels, but cannot be taken as applying
to Kharan camels.

Dear Bulletin,— Your “Sporting Notions
idviie punters “ not to forget that Carbine, as a three-
year-old, could not win the Australian Cup.” It hap-
pened that Carbine had then to meet Lochiel, at a differ-
ence of lib. only in weights, the famous Maoriland horse
having just previously given Carbine 61bs. and a beating
in their places for the Newmarket Handicap. Moreover,
Carbine was not “cherry ripe” at the time. He had
been training in sweaters before the Fleinington meeting,
and was then running into form. Two days after the
Australian Cup he beat Abercorn for the Champion
Stakes, another two days later he was fit enough to beat
Lochiel by a head, at a difference of libs., in the Loch
Plate. Anon he beat everything at Randwick Autumn
meeting, where he won his first Sydney Cup, with 9st. up.
Had Carbine been specially prepared for the Australian
Cup, aforesaid, he would probably have defeated even
Lochiel. Anyway, his failure on that occasion is not a
sound argument against The Harvester’s chance for next
Australian Cup, seeing that there is no flying Lochiel at
3st. 71bs. in the handicap.—Form.

Petronel is the only son of the great Musket

Dear Bulletin,— Daily papers to the contrary
notwithstanding, Saturday last w if not the hardest blow
for the past 40 years in Sydney harbor. About 17 years
ago the sailing races at Balmain Regatta were not finished
on Prince of Wales’, birthday owing to the wind dying
away, so w* re sailed! off on the following Saturday. It
blew a terrific gnleJtrpm the S.S.W., and of some 23 boats
which started, 23 and 24 open boats class, hut
two could go the Sow and Pigs—the Lottie and the
Young Jivn/r Such men as George Ellis and Gardiner ran
lor shelW; one to Chowder and the other to Watson’s,
and most of the boats either carried their sticks away or
were capsized. Last Saturday was not a patch on that
day, and I have no doubt Ellis, still in active service,
would bear me out.—W.

Joe Goddard is off to England. He has deferred

Afghan and Billy Uru, the herculean Maori footballer,

Referring to the Mount Jukes gold-dis-
covery, the Strahan correspondent of the Zeehan
Herald writes :—“ J. Harris, a well-known pros-
pector, arrived here from Mount Jukes with some
splendid samples ofstone'all carrying good gold.
The new find is situated upon the western slope of
Mt. Jukes, and about six or seven miles from Mt.
Lyell. The parties have been prospecting there
for some time, and have at last struck what has
evidently shed the gold found in the creeks round
about. Several pieces—in fact, all they had with
them—are now on view, and have caused no end
of excitement here. The reef is from 7ft. to Bft.
wide, carrying good gold throughout. The pros-
pectors have secured two 10-acre reward claims
and three adjoining leases, and have already had
many applications for interests, but it is their in-
tention to, if possible, place the whole thing before
the public, and let them see for themselves what
it is. The fortunate parties are: John Harris,
John Benassi, W. Wilson, and W. Castles.”

“GRATEFUL RESULTS"
Mrs. Lydia M. Tarbox, of Altoona,
Pennsylvania, U. S. A.,
Restored to Health by the use of
Ayer’s Sarsaparilla
“Last Spring, I was grievously afflicted
with biliousness and liver complaint. My
mouth was in a terrible condition every
morning, my tongue thickly coated, my
breath was offensive, and my bowels were
always out of order; nor did the many rem-
edies recommended do me any good, until I
tried Ayer’s Sarsaparilla, when my improve-
ment began almost from the first dose.
This unlooked-for, but grateful, result, was
accomplished by only two and a half bottles
of Ayer’s Sarsaparilla.” *

A BIG BIZ!
Our Trade is Big 1 Our Store is Big !
Our Ideas are Big I
We get bigger every day; on Saturday night
we are bigger than on the previous Monday,
and on the Wednesday following we are bigger
still. We can’t help growing. We have all the
elements of growth. The soil we are planted in
is good, the climate propitious, the people kind.
We are continually watered by the lifegiving
showers of a nation’s approval. Can anyone
wonder that we grow?
Our growth is a wonderful thing. People
describe it as magical. There is no magic in it.
Anyone, or any set of people, can do the same if
they do as we have done. But they don’t; they
can’t find the way, charge too much for the privi-
lege of doing business with them, and generally
and deplorably make a mess of the whole affair.
That’s the mischief.
Most People Like Us I All Believe in Us!
Not a Few Swear by Us!
It’s cupboard love. We suit them, make their
money go a long way, and generally render the
path of life an easy one. There’s no sentiment
about it. It’s real biz, and no mistake. In that
way we are beloved throughout Australia, the
measure of affection each one bestows upon us
being gauged by the amount of benefit received.
The more you buy at our store the greater your
liking for us will become, because the more you
invest with us the better dividends you receive.

Baron Berzilins’-
Bnchu Bitters.
BARON BERZILIUS’ REPORT.
They are chiefly given in complaints of the Urinary
Organs, such as Gravel, Chronic Catarrh, morbid Irrita-
tion of the Bladder and Urethra, Diseases of the Prostrate*
Glands, and Retention or Inconvenience of Urine, from
the loss of tone in the parts concerned in its evacuation.
These Bitters I also recommend in Dyspepsia, in Chronic
Rheumatism and Cutaneous affections. The action of
Buchu on the human frame is more effectual on all
diseases of the Kidneys and Bladder than any other herbal
plant; and it also assists persons suffering from Skin
Diseases, causing a healthy action of the secretions and
inducing perspiration.

STUDY HEALTH BY TAKING ROW’S
STEANE’S BITTERS.
The great demand throughout the colony for
these pure Bitters shows they are superior to all
others and equalled by none.
Pacts Speak Louder than Words.

citizen:—
Statutory Declaration.
. George Hewett, do hereby solemnly and
sincerely declare as follows
I hat I feel it a duty I owe to the public to
state that I have been suffering for many years
from weakness of the stomach, so called INDL
GESTION or DYSPEPSIA, and have been cured
PX “y ta k mg two or three glasses of ROW’S
fo I EANE’b BITTERS a day in a little water, and
1 hope others suffering from the same complaint
Will be as speedily cured.
“(Signed) G. HEWETT,

Row’s You’ll Do Bitters.
All who suffer from Chest Complaints, Cold, Coughs
and general weakness of the Lungs, will gain more ease
and comfort from a wineglass of ROW’S YOU’LL DO
BITTERS than any cough medicine tried before.
Read what Medical men say about them—
BJERKIN, M.D.The Bitter is pure, and not like
others in overdoses. It has a remarkable influence on the
liver, promoting the secretions of Bile, and correcting it
when deranged, and restores healthy evacuations in cases
of habitual costiveness.
D. ECKSTROM, M.D.—BBBB—I find these Bitters a
most valuable and wholesome tonic, being’ pure and
strengthening'; a stimulant to the liver, assisting diges-
tion. 1 therefore thus recommend them.
G. B. WOOD, M.D.—lt is the purest of Bitters, and
exerts a peculiar influence over the liver.
Row’s Pepsine Bitters.
All who suffer from Weak Digestion will soon
be cured by these Bitters, taken three times a day
before meals.
Row’s Oriental Bitters.
A Splendid General Tonic, with a tumbler of
water makes a drink equal to any best Champagne.
Row’s Steane’s Wine
Is a safe and sure stimulant for the female sex or
children, for it raises and strengthens depressed
systems without producing a temporary excite-
ment to be followed by greater depression.
Persons suffering from loss of appetite and
eneral depression of spirits cannot do better than
take
ROW’S STEANE’P WINE.
It cannot harm you, but must do good to all
delicate persons. Youno Ladies can take this
when suffering from general debility. It’s only a
pure tonic. Try it.
Teetotallers will find this newly-invented
TONIC answer all the purposes of a stimulant
without its intoxicating quality. It will satisfy
the cravings of nature and create a desire for food
instead of drink. As an anti-febrile is unsur-
passed.
CAUTION.—When you call for these ask for
ROW’S, and take no substitute.

Dear Bulletin, —“ Heretic ” misconceives
the new hedonism, which says nothing at all
about man s relation to the universe—the wheel.
What it deals with is the man-fly’s relation to the
other flies who go round with him. That is a per-
fectly legitimate basis for the construction of a
system of morals. The universe doesn’t care
whether or no “ Heretic ” gets three meals a day,
but he probably thinks three meals desirable all
the same. Hedonism leaves the universe out of
the question ; ta-kes it for granted ; and simply
says, things being so-and-so, the best course of
action for humanity is such-and-such. Isn’t that
rational?—B.B.
Mr. Otto Fischer, President of Sydney
German Club, in celebrating the 24th anniversary
of the German Empire at Fern Bay, lavishly
eulogised blood-and-iron Bismarck for his great-
ness as a man. Not as a man, certainly, but as a
machine should Bismarck be called great. Hairy
old Parkes describes him more correctly in one of
his inspired sonnets:
Yet, 0 how little all which men call great
w Has blessed men’s homes or formed a happy State 1
In what faint letters on the scroll of fame
Will be inscribed the world-resounding name 1
How far from those who hold the highest place—
The benefactors of the human race ! ”
The tendency of a nation to grow like its ideals
should restrain citizens from setting up as types
of greatness for a free people men whose leading
trait is the despotic.
The N.S. Wales Government Printer issues
(in the reign of a “ retrenching ” Government) a
bulky, expensive, and lavishly-dismal volume
with the words, “Report of the Executive Com-
missioner for N.S.W. to the World’s Columbian
Exposition, Chicago, 1893,” thundering in an
awful blast of big print over the title-page. As
an example of how the public money goes, and a
beautiful instance of the at-last-bebaubled “Exe-
cutive Commissioner’s” craving after notoriety,
the volume possesses a certain interest, but other-
wise it is a dreary wilderness of print and illus-
trations. It contains nearly 100 pictures, showing
different parts of the Exhibition, views of Chicago,
and other things which excite a feeble interest in
those people who get their big volume gratis, but
which nobody else cares about; likewise 671 pages
of print, and an immense multitude of plans and ele-
vations of all manner of things. The printed matter
deals with such solemn subjects as “Prehistoric
Footprints in Nevada,” “ Rules and Regulations
for the Supply of Compressed Air Power from
Shafting,” “Folk-lore of China,” “Pueblo
Indians,” a prayer by Cardinal Gibbons, and
other things equally irrelevant. Why the N.S.W.
tax-payer should be called upon to pay for prayers
by Cardinal Gibbons and for the diffusion of
knowledge about Chinese lies passes comprehen-
sion.

“ It is with heartfelt grati-
tude I write to tell you of the
great benefit my little daugh-
ter Gladys has derived from
‘Benger s Food.’ The doctor
and all who saw her thought
we should never he able to
rear her. We took her to the
hospital, and the authori-
ties recommended 4 Eenger's
Food.' From that time she
began to pick up flesh and
strength." , ,
44 If every mother knew of
Its value no ether would he
used.”
John Thompson, the suddenly-deceased
Premier of Canada, ’verted to Roman Catholicism
in his middle age.
In early days, ere Hobart Domain was
fenced along by the cattle-jetties, much terror was
often caused by cattle which, when landed, broke
away and rushed through the city. An old resi-
dent relates that he and two friends were bathing
one morning near the jetties when several beasts
stampeded and charged the bathers, who, while
perfectly nude, had to seek shelter up a tree. In
their excitement they did not notice that someone
else had gone up the same tree till they heard a
voice from above : “Good morning, gentlemen.
An undress levee, I presume, we’d call this.” It
was Gov. Denison, who had got out of harm’s way
when the cattle “ ran amuck.”
Dear Bulletin, —When Civil Service
reform comes along let us hope that the salaries
of will be fixed on a more common-
sense scale than now. Surely these men with nice
easy billets, no brain-work, and no responsibility,
are not entitled to a higher remuneration than the
average tradesman ; indeed, considering that
theirs is a life-job, without broken time, the wages
should really be lower. Good carpenters, masons,
and bricklayers, making uncertainly from .£70 to
£100 a year, may well sigh for the post of an
official flunkey, at £130 per annum certain, with
a good chance of eventually rising to, say, £275.
This scandal exists all over Australasia. In
Maoriland, I knew a messenger who was the land-
lord of the Minister in charge of the department,
and in many Australian departments messengers
grow wealthy by lending small sums to impecu-
nious officials “ till the end of the month.”—Timi

Sixty-five years have gone since the stone
was hewn by a convict-gang for building Darling-
hurst Gaol, Sydney. The quarry where the con-
victs worked was in Woolloomoqloo, at the pre-
sent crossing of Palmer-street with William-st.,
and thence came all the stone for the first gaol-
buildings and wall. The buildings have long ago
been pulled down, and new ones built of Pyrmont
stone. But the old wall has yet a part standing,
and the ugly signs upon it are still as clear as
when the convict cut them to record his output,
for untiring industry meant for him indulgence in
tea and sugar. The contractor for the wall had a
dispute with Govt, when the work was ended, but
the difference was met by giving him a life-
pension of £2 a week and the right to live in a
d veiling of his own inside the gaol wall. So he
built himself a rubble hut near the present black-
smith’s shop, and, having whitewashed it, he
moved in with a bunk, a chair and table, and for
several years lived there, a strange, useless exis-
tence. Whence and whither he came and
went no one seems to know, but warder
M’Master (who has just been pensioned off, and
used to be a sentry at Darlinghurst from ’41 to ’48)
describes him as “ a little wee old man with a wee
-little black dog;” wearing, among other things,
an immense cabbage-tree hat and a pint-and-a
half black bottle. Every morning, about half-
past 10, he came out of his hut, stole silently past
the sentry, and through the gaol gates to the
nearest hotel to get his bottle filled with rum;
then he returned as silently as he had gone, went
into his hut and stayed there all day by himself.

The “Voice from the Hush.”
Editor Bulletin, — Whatever may be the
history of this poem now more or leas
authoritatively attributed to Mowbray Morris
—it is perhaps worth while, just “for the
of God and of Gwendoline,” to note some
internal evidence pointing, apparently, to Gordon
as the author, after all. In spite of the inferior
literary merit of the “Voice,” as compared with
the acknowledged works of the centaur-poet, there
exist between them correspondences of thought
and expression difficult to explain away.
“ Ve Wearie Wayfarer ” and the “ Voice’’open
on the same scene, with the difference that, in the
former, “Two-thirds of my journey, at least, is
done,” and, in the latter, “I’ve half the day
before me yet, and most of my journey done.”
Then the reflections of the reposing traveller,
however extended and diversified in “Ye W. W.,”
are almost its counterpart in sporting reminiscence,
and are like nothing else outside Gordon. The
gratuitous justification of sport, occurring twice in
“Ye W. W.” and once in “ Hippodromania,”
appears also in the “Voice.” Now, observe the
correspondence in a rather singular thought. In
the “ Sick Stockrider ” we have :
For good undone and gifts mis spent and resolutions
vain,
’Tis somewhat late to trouble. This I know—
I should live the same life over if I had to live again ;
And the chances are I go where most men go.
In the “ Voice ”
Of the seed I’ve sown in pleasure,
The harvest I'm reaping in pain ;
Could I put my life a few years back,
Would I live that life again ?
Would I? Of course, I would 1 &o.
Such recurn noe of thought, more or less
obvious, may be found in every stanza of the
“Voice.” Nor are verbal parallelisms lacking.
In the “ Sick Stockrider ” we have :
The hardest day was never then too hard.
In the “ Voice ” :
The hardest work is never too hard,
Or (sic) the longest day too long.
Again, in “ Cui Bono,” we have :—•
On this earth so rough we know quite enough,
And, I sometimes fancy, a little too much.
In the “ Voice ” :
We knew too much, but not quite enough.
The expressive mannerism “here and there”
appears at least twice in Gordon, and, in similar
context, we have it in the “ Voice.” The word
“little,” in its adverbial application, is very freely
used by Gordon, and in the “Voice” we have
“ 1 here’s little enough of shade to be got.” Such
verbal parallelisms abound —trivial, taken one by
one, but, collectively, helping to thicken other
proofs.
In reading Gordon, we are struck by the many
familiar allusions to his pipe. Three instances are
found in “ Ye W. W.,”two in “Hippodromania,”
one in the “Sick Stockrider,” and one in the
“ Exile’s Farewell.” The author of the “Voice”
repeats the reference, and exactly in Gordon’s
manner.
Of the 47 poems which compose the collection of
Gordon’s acknowledged works, 30, at least, end
with a picture or suggestion of death ; and in 11
of these, the thought, morbidly introverted, ap-
pears as a personal forecast, a desirable exchange
of the intolerable for the unknown. This, by the
way, is observable in “ Argemone ” (which ap-
peared in The Bulletin, of Oct. 20), and is one
of the many internal evidences of that poem’s
authenticity. The same prospective refuge occurs
to the thought-sick and futureless poet of the
“ Voice.”
Again, Gordon is not, in the strict sense of the
term, an Australian poet. He is Anglo-Austra-
lian. His best poetry, of course, is cosmopolitan
in scope and age-long in currency; but, entering
the sphere of tangible things, his early culture
asserts itself, and his imagination, by very neces-
sity of its heroic tendency and retrospective bias,
dwells on military glory, on classic and mediaeval
tradition, on the excellence of the Anglo-Saxon
race and the Norman blood. His only purely
Australian poems are the “ Hippodromania ”
series, the “Sick Stockrider,” the “Dedication,”
“From the Wreck,” “Wolf and Hound,” “Gone,”
and the “ Basket of Flowers.” Others, such as
“Ye W. W.,” the beautiful “Whisperings in
Wattle-Boughs,” &0., are merely English jewels
in Australian setting. To him “Snows are rife in
December, and sheaves are in August yet.” The
sound of cattle-bells recalls “ The chimes of
sweet St. Mary’s, on far English ground.” In
the only Australian fytte of “Ye W, W.” it
occurs to the moralising poet that “In Exeter
Hall the saints may chide.” He cannot get
beyond the English exile. “ How We Beat the
Favorite” is as grossly English as J. B. Patter-
son. Gordon’s English reminiscences are free and
felicitous; his Australian reminiscences are, by
comparison, forced and perfunctory.
So with the author of the “ Voice.” Instead of
the parrot’s screech, this soliloquist also seems to
hear the twang of the horn, &o. His semi-military
and sporting reminiscences of England are also
glowing and unconstrained beside the woxlen
pseudo-memories of Australian life.
This suggests another agreement in impress of
authorship. Gordon is a “ gentleman ” —a sterling
man, to be sure, but a “gentleman,” nevertheless.
The far-reaching curse of caste is upon him—just
like Original Sin upon the present writer. His
sympathies are with the Oavaliers, with Sir John
and His Grace, with baron and squire, and knight
of the shire. His only Australian hero is the aris-
tocratic, but hideously incapable, Burke. There
is nothing democratic in Gordon’s fellowship,
though ; to his great credit, he rarely sinks into
that most pitiable of all vulgarities, namely, the
direct assumption of a soap-bubble distinction
offensive alike to gods and men.
Now, the same old-world instinct of indefinable
superiority to Brown, Jones, and Robinson is a
pervading element in the “Voice,” rendered con-
spicuous by the intense subjectivity of the poem—
a subjectivity which may count as another coin-
cidence in tendency with Gordon’s acknowledged
works. This ingrained sentiment mars the
verisimilitude of the Australian memories in the
“Voice” by dictating such names as Jack
Villiers, Byng (broke in the Derby of ’5B), and
Harry Lepel—presumably occupants of a station
hut. And here we are reminded of Frank Mostyn
and Carisbrooke (bai Jove!) in a suspiciously
similar reminiscence of the “Sick Stockrider.”
The author of the “ Voice ” is among: the lads,
but not of them; he is not only a reduced gentle-
man, but accepts his fate exactly in Gordon’s
spirit. Indeed, “Banjo’s” “Voice from the
Town ” fails in consistency as a sequel —or, rather,
companion-poem—to the “Voice,’’only in that it
is Australian instead of Anglo-Australian, and
isocratic instead of class-suggestive.
Let it be clearly understood that no disparage-
ment of Gordon is implied in these last para-
graphs. Brave, truthful, chivalrous, magnani-
mous to a fault, he voices unspoken thought in
every generous heart, Australian and foreign; and
what higher tribute can be claimed or conceded
than the great and growing esteem of readers
who, by the especial grace of Providence, are
neither Englishmen nor “gentlemen ! ”
To conclude, the Poems and the “ Voice ” are
alike distinguished by the tyranny of memory, by
the absence of humor and of rancour, and by a
forced and inadequate stoicism, thinly veiling
sensitive self-pity. So that, without pronouncing
positively on the origin of the “ Voice,” it may be
taken as falling fairly within Gordon’s narrow
and exceptional range, and as being more closely
allied to that poet’s works by mental and verbal
parallelism than to any other collection in the
language—requiring, indeed, nothing but a Scrip-
tural allusion and a scrap of Latin or Greek to
make the family resemblance perfect. And the
crude, faulty, unlicked diction—alternating with
good strong Gordon-like lines—may be a blemish
pertaining to half-finished and rejected work.
Then it only remains to condone the absence of
secondary rhymes. y
Shepparton, Vic. Tom Ooluns.
[Note.—The Bulletin prints this letter because it is
interesting, because the incidental criticism of Gordon is
good, and because the view that Gordon wrote “ A Voice
from the Bush ” is still held by many readers on similar
evidence to that adduced—apart from the fact that the
verses appear in every published edition of Gordon’s
works. The question of authorship was, however,
definitely set at rest some years ago. In Howlett-Ross’s
memoir of Gordon (p, 86 et seq.) the matter is fully dis-
cussed. After quotation of some of the parallelisms
instanced by “Tom Collins,” it is stated that the poem
has been emphatically claimed by Mr. Mowbray Morris
(now of London Times) in a U tter written to Major Fer-
guson, of the S.A. Bide Brigade. Mr. Morris says:
“ Certainly the verses are mine. I remember both the
time and place where I wrote them—lying on my back in
a cave at Robe in the autumn of 1871. ... I was not
aware that there was any sim larity, unconscious or other-
wise, to any verses of Gordon’s. I have two volumes of
his verse by me, and I cannot detect any conscious [? un-
conscious] plagiarisms. Certainly there were none con-
sciously committed. Mine they are, every line and every
word, and they have no business among the writings of
anyone else.” Apparently the verses were first published
anonymously in Adelaide Advertiser ; but the editor,
when applied to, had forgotten the name of the author;
and Marcus Clarke doubtfully inserted them In his edition
of Gordon when sent him by an unknown correspondent.
There is evidence that Mr. Morris claimed them about the
time of publication ; Gordon never claimed them ; and
their inclusion with his worics is apparently due only to
the fact that style and matter are similar in some points
to his. That similarity, however, is easily accounted for.
“ The Sick Stockrider,” the poem of Gordon’s which
“A Voise from the Bush” most resembles, was pub-
lished in “Bush Ballads and Galloping Rhymes” in
1870, and had previously appeared in print. Doubt-
less Mowbray Morris read it, and writing in 1871—
next year, with the verses fresh in his memory—he
plagiarised unconsciously or otherwise. Probably Gor-
don’s verse, and the likeness of Gordon’s experience
to his own, suggested to Morris to try his hand. There is
little force in “Tom Collins’” corroborative instances.
Every bush poet puts his pipe—and his horse, and a
woman—into his poetrjn They are the only three reliable
“properties” he has—in imagination; for among the
wattles of real life the woman and the horse are generally
unreliable. So the pipe is closest to his heart of all. And
death—varied by suggestions of heaven and hell-seems
to be the natural climax of all Australian verse. Lawson
almost invariably kills bis heroes; “The Banjo” sends
old Pardon careering round celestial race-courses; and
even Daley walks Larry over the Milky Way. Anyhow,
in the absence of rebutting evidence, and with such an
explanation of the coincidences available, Morris’s direct
statement must be taken as conclusive; and “A Voice
from the Bush ” should henceforth disappear from Gor-
don’s published poems.—Ed. B.]
A Modern Miracle.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
You have heard of Balaam’s donkey, and the woe-
ful words he spoke
When the prophet tried coercion on that dispu-
tatious moke,
And though the age of miracles long since departed
hence,
They occasionally happen in this age of common
sense.
And the one I am expounding— which my words
are strictly true—
Is sufficiently astounding to knock aged Balaam
“ blue.”
It occurred to Jerry Jowler—whose case I think
was sad,
Though I’m not at all disputing that his character
was bad—
Still, about his antecedents I have no desire to
speak.
Simply, then-he got in trouble and was brought
before the beak ;
And the “screw” who apprehended him accused
hun then and there
Of creating a disturbance in a public thoroughfare,
And with using dreadful language—which the
bobby said he swore
His immediate intention was to wallow in some
gore!
And Jerry chewed a straw, as if he didn’t care a
rap,
And wiped, unostentatiously, his nose upon his
cap.
He was not intoxicated, though abstracted was his
gaze,
And the beak looked grim and muttered (sotto
voce) —“ Seven days.”
Now, I’ve known this Jerry Jowler from his boy-
hood’s happy hours,
Without once dreaming he possessed weird, super-
human powers ;
And yet he was the agent of a miracle first-class,
For undoubtedly poor Jerry was as dumb as
Balaam’s ass !
And when a chap swears freely who’s been deaf
and dumb from birth,
I maintain that deeds miraculous still happen on
this earth.
What! another explanation? No, it’s really (oo
absurd,
And you can’t be such a sceptic as to doubt a
bobby’s word.

“Rick the treasure , sweet the pleasure ■ sweetest pleasure after pain'.'
Dryden (Homocea Measure.)
“ IT TOUCHES THE SPOT.”-Aye, that is what ‘Homocea’
does. And does it quickly too—whether it’s a toothache or
neuralgia, with all their shooting pains, or eczema, with its
painful and distressing irritation. Rheumatism in the joints or
muscles has been cured, even of years’ standing—while for
cuts, burns, and bruises it is far ahead of any ointment that has ever been
before the public.
LORD GARRICK
says ‘Homocea’
cured him of He-
morrhoids, when —MM
all else failed ; that he gave some to a labourer who was rendered quite lame
by a stone falling upon him, and it cured him in four
days. A woman had a pain in the elbow and could
not bend it for a year, and it cured her, and another
used it for a bad leg, and it was doing her good.
One letter closes from him with the words, “It is the
most wonderful stuff I ever came across.”
LORD COMBERMERE says that he
found “Homocea did him more good
than any other embrocation he had ever
used for rheumatism.
Remember that “ Homocea” subdues inflammation and allays irritation almost as soon as applied.
All Storekeepers and Chemists stock “ Homocea.”

It was in Maoriland in the sixties—that is, in
the days when the diggers dreamed not of prohi-
bition, and when one was much more certain than
now to get in a mining town a dram of decent
stuff incapable of blowing the cork out.
Plainly, there was something astir. Everybody
had on his best. A new barmaid had arrived
(there is no hope for the wretches who would
rob the diggers of that comfort) at Widow
Brown’s pub. In twos, threes, or sixes, the whols
place dropped in, four or five times an hour, to
have “another gaze.”
She was the sole topic of conversation. “ Ain’t
she clean !” said one. “ That wur a slashing feed
we had to-day !” said another. “ Best tucker ever
I struck !” added a third, with a furtive glance
from beneath the rim of a hat that seemed
intended as a coyer for his face.
By the end of the week, the new-comer was no
longer a stranger. Everybody know her. She
was a woman of over 30, marvellously preserved.
She had never been married, though—well, she
had been queen of many gold-rushes.
The man who has spent a quarter-of-a-eentury in
the Australian provinces has seen ten civilisations,
anyway. There is ground for belief that later
civilisations have degenerated.
The woman of to-day is not the cook of the past.
There is an air of cindered chops about the present
hapless creature. To-day too many matrons want
their daughters to play “the planner.” Too
many mothers wash the clothes, and get the lan-
guid girls to bring them in. (Thus the man passing
by, the clothes-line is deceived.) Therefore, our
civilisation is comparable to a needle which has
been too finely sharpened and too much reduced
at the sides. This reduction has been visible
throughout Australia for twenty years past.
Now, the consequences of this fatal relapse of
woman are manifold and terrible. The bad cook
is only a slow murderess.
But there was grit in our barmaid. She was
none of these. She could produce a meal worthy
of Man— and digging breeds men. She was tidy
to a hair. She was trim as a snug vessel. And —
she was handsome.
Of course the whole district became infatuated
with her. Diggers go that way. They sit in the
solitude of their huts and dream of the ideal in
the guise of the handiest flesh-and-blood substi-
tute. In the night it is their companion. In this
way do single miners love a million times—it is
their polygamy. They love with a distant, wor-
shipful love—“ the desire of the moth for the
star.”
They are pleased if she visits their claim and
watches the water flying from the sluicing-nozzle.
They show her the rainbow under the jet. They
bring her nuggets. And if she speaks to them, be
it only a “ Good-day !” they fancy that their
affection is making headway, and rejoice in every
fibre of their being.
Out of her admirers the charmer reduced the
cluster to two, and between these the contest was
terrible. They hung about the place like unto
dogs chained. She ran against one, or the other,
or both, each minute. She spake to them singly,
or in a pair, forty odd times an hour. It was evi-
dent to the boys that something was “ looming up
ahead.”
The aspirants were named Louis and Charles,
both Frenchmen and over 40. The worst of a
Frenchman is that France hangs like a plumb-bob
before his nose, and everything has to be regarded
across France. But the regard here was not of
conceit—it was fury.
One night there was a rumor that Charles had
struck a “ pile ”in his claim. People began to
bet whether our ideal would be influenced by the
find. It was freely asserted that night would see
it decided.
I was hot and restless during the evening, and I
went down to the sea-beach, two miles distant. I
sat on a log and smoked and let the sweet hum of
the Pacific eat its way into my ears. This con-
tent of reverie surpasses the pleasure of books,
and is the nearest approach to the pleasure of
gratified love which a mind undistorted can dis-
cover on this crude planet.
Suddenly I saw a figure streaming out towards
the sea. It was Louis.
“ Don’t be a fool! ” I said, as I locked my arm
in his and led him away. He had been rejected.
Additional confirmation was granted when the
pair were seen walking out for a stroll on the
morrow.
They were married. 1 didn’t see the wedding
(a most informal transaction) as I had all my
work cut out to guard Louis. May I never again
take such a contract!
Every wedding involves a question of senti-
ment. One morning the husband went to cut
wood. He returned suddenly and took a silent
peep into his apartments. Then he stole off on
tip-toe for his gun. That is the other end of the
sentiment. When he returned the room was
empty ; the birds had fled.
And because he couldn’t find anybody to shoot
he pined away and grew silly. When I left, the
abandoned one had made his claim over to a
stranger.
From that day the story is a blank. The
denouement is unknown. But wherever she is I
swear the scones in the cupboard will be capital.
As said before, she was a good cook. Some have
thought that cookery is a form of virtue. They
ewed. Virtue is a form of cookery.
POLYPE.
Mr. Geo. Collingridge is publishing, at
Hornsby Junction, N.S.W., an illustrated journal
called Progekss, devoted to recording facts about
early Australian history. The number which has
reached The Bulletin contains some good ex-
amples of Mr. Collingndge’s skill as wood-en-
graver.
Chief Justice Way, when he did his last
soulful grovel to the departing Kintore, entreated
that magnate to have his speeches published in
book-form, because the people of S. A. were pining
for such a record. The Bulletin trusts that some
other Governor will fall in with this suggestion.
Nothing is so calculated to keep a Governor
humble, and to prevent him saying too much
about the silken bonds, and to remind him that
he isn’t nearly so interesting as a cricket-match
or a football-scrum, as the sight of his volume of
speeches in the threepenny-basket outside a
second-hand bookshop. A good many Governors
who have made fools of themselves in days gone
by might have died amid general respect if they
had had an unsaleable volume of speeches to keep
them in a meek and contrite mood.
A REMINISCENCE.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
Many years ago, in Central Queensland, there was
a drought so savage and long-continued that it
caused the abandonment of whole districts.
Without doubt other causes tended to this end.
Kangaroos, and—let us say, banks. But the fact
remains, that the interior of Western Australia is
not, at the present day, a more utter desert than
was one large area which I and some others
were, at that time, unfortunately for us, forced to
traverse.
There was water on it, true; but the
eaten by worms before they died, swarmed over
the land, and left the mark of their poisonous
teeth, worse than a goat’s, on every vestige of
decent herbage.
For something grew upon their trail that was
neither grass nor weed, only quite unwholesome.
They even did not thrive on it, for they were
shrunken and nerveless. An ancient sheep-dog that
we picked up, more than half-dying, and restored
to life, used to bark at them ; and, after a feeble
run, they would totter and fall over.
The edges of the scrubs were lined with the
bones of the lesser marsupial vermin, and there
was no man in the land but ourselves. Gaunt
corner-posts of deserted huts rose here and there.
Stations of the order of that day, for it was long
before the dandy modern times, stood tenantless,
waiting for any ad venturous swagman to enter and
assume the rdle of squatter. But none was there,
and of those who were with me, some went north
to the Gulf, and bad whisky soon killed them ;
some went west, and the niggers knocked
them on the head ; some came south, and died of
over-feeding. I believe that I am the only sur-
vivor of that trip.
It was not as if it were a desert-land, wherein no
footstep had fallen before. On the contrary. On
every side were signs of former habitation, rotting
fast into decay, for there was naught to make a
bush-fire to destroy them ; nothing but barren
clurpps of scrub, beyond which no fire would
travel. Nobody came there, except Tottering
kangaroos. There were no natives. There was
actually nothing living from morn to night but
dying marsupials of all types.
There were lagoons, truly, but in hard, barren
ridges ;. and some few colts, who had seemingly
been left behind, sustained existence by plunging
their heads deep down under water and grasping
at the green, wet weed below, coming up to breathe
with long tussocks between their jaws. This weed,
I suppose, with pickings from the scrub, kept
them alive.
We fed our own horses on what flour we had,
and tied them up at night so that they should not
wander on the poisonous trail left by the dying
marsupials.
Always there was a brazen sky, an awful sun,
and never a drop of moisture. Always there were
the remains of what man had once built, but never
a sign of his presence. You could have left a pile
of sovereigns in one of the shaking huts, and re-
turned in a month to find them there, untouched.
When the rain eventually came, and grass
sprang up, a long, trailing vine, something
like an exaggerated sweet-potato, grew also, and
covered the earth. This soon disappeared, and
the country resumed its normal state. But one
good thing had been effected by the drought:
the marsupials, big and little, had disappeared;
and, when they again appeared, the advance of
time had made them of some commercial value,
which was in itself sufficient to keep their numbers
n check.

“No, sire! ” But he had to marry her, and they

Five days before the news of R. L.
Stevenson’s death reached England, the editor of
the magnificent new Edinburgh edition of his

esteem accorded to his talent; but its first fruits
reached him only in time to be laid as memorials

got himself “remanded,” and so forth, all to

A proposal is mooted in London for the
construction of a big hotel for honeymoon couples
only. The rooms are to be specially decorated to

bride. The guests won’t stare at the brides, for

will be discreet men specially warranted not to
snigger at their endearments. Newly-married
couples may hug each other all over the house,
there being no cynical bachelors or old, hard-faced
wives about to object; and they may coo till far
into the night without the family in the next suite
of apartments objecting. No attendant will come
into a room without knocking several times and
dropping various heavy articles. Also, all these
things will be charged in the bill, on the assump-
tion that a newly-married couple is too blissfully
dazed to argue about overcharges.
