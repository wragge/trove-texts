Verses by Fritz Hart
The latest volumes of “The Wisdom of the
East” series (Murray; 2s.) includes The
Way of Contentment, translated from the
Japanese of Ivaibara Ekken, a 27th century
philosopher, who advises his disciples on
many tilings concerning the soul and the
body. In the latter department: “If you
have a fefeling of giddiness during the night
move your big to^s; by thus doing, you will
bring on a fit of yawning, during which the
giddiness will pass off.” Another volume is
Ancient Egyptian Legends, which contains a
cheerful tale entitled “The Beer of Heli-
opolis,” which this critic regrets that he has
never tasted.
“In a moment his arms were around her,”
we are told beneath the frontispiece of In
Facing Silk, by Gerald It. Baldwin (N.S.W.
Bookstall). But the artist is more re-
strained. He shows us that only one arm
was around her, and that that arm had gone
only half-way. And at the end, “His only
answer was to draw her to him and again
kiss her on the lips.” In between, there are
200 pages of racing, intrigue and girl. What
more does the Australian reader want for
his Bookstall shilling?
THE HILLS.
Crouched against the sky,
The hills like mammoths lie
Asleep! Spent is the rage
Of ilieir forgotten age.
JSiow rest they deep
In an eternal sleep!
The curving line
Of monstrous spine—
'The aspect grim
Of mighty limb,
Are grass-clad now ;
And leafy bough,
A nd golden bloom
Of burning broom.
The sleeping monsters dress
In robes of loveliness.
Their strength alone remains;
And we, from peaceful plains,
Look up with wonder; half-afraid
To see them stir in sleep—and swayed
By awe of what past ages knew,
Ere time her monstrous offspring slew!
AT MIDNIGHT.
Vague, trembling and uncertain, on the flow
Of midnight stream the poplar-shadows fa"-
A mystic thrill of silence ( musical —
Though noiseless as the stars that would
forego
Their place in Heaven, and, mirrored, shine
below)
Fills full and holds the heart of Love in
thrall: ,
Obliterating fears that did appal,
Till moonlit midnight caused their over-
throw.
Grave, tender, loving eyes of perfect faith.
More exquisitely deep than summer night
By faery stream;- you gazed in mine, and
made
It crystal-clear—spite what the preacher
saith —
All is not vain: and that our earthly plight
Is Heaven-blest, so we walk unafraid!
Open, your window and gaze at file morn,
A nd —listen !
A lark sings of jewels—night's tear-drops
forlorn —
That glisten !
Open pour door and step into the day,
See—under
The lee of the hedgerow — webs, silver and
gray;
And wonder!
Open your heart to my love; and to spring's
Endeavor ;
Full-throated and clear is our song, and it
rings
For ever!
From “Appassionata,” by Fritz Hart.
MORNING SONG.
Welcome a new Australian poet—a minor
bard but melodious. In Appassionato-, Songs
of Youth and Love (Lothian, Melb.; 3s. 6d.),
Fritz Hart collects some 80 little songs and
sonnets, slight, pleasing and admirably
wrought. He sings for the joy of singing,
but he is technically well equipped. His
theme is young love: —
Since you have loved me, Love, so well —
Why not a little better? >
Why not have kept the spirit-truth,
As you have kept the letter?...,
0, crimson heart of Ijove for which I seek
By night and day beneath the world's gray
skies —
0, budding mouth, and brimming, fevent
eyes —
Deep-bosomed Love —when may I lay my
cheek
For heart-ease on thine own? that I may
speak
The words incapable of ecstasies:
But whose high crystal-summit thou’lt sur-
mise,
As men through mountain mist divine the
peak ....
A month ago —a week — nay, less —a day —
And Love danced in those eyes that now
portray
The calculating mind of one who knows
And weighs the merits of a judged rose, —
Nor perfume, glow, nor hushed beauty
seeks,
But some faint flaw —then critically speaks!
A day ago! How fete the hours now sped
Since Love was living—Love that now is
dead!
All very young, but very delightfully
young. But Fritz Hart is in love not only
with Love, but with verse. He decks his
stanzas with fastidious taste in word and
phrase. Likely enough he will not go far,
enough for us that he has so buoyantly set
forth.
The origin of Lite
How did life begin? Why did it begin?
Or did it begin? Benjamin Moore, professor
of Bio-Chemistry at Liverpool University, in
The Origin and Nature of Life (Home Uni-
versity Library ; Is. 3d. in Australasia), re-
writes Genesis for the modern scientific stu-
dent. He begins far back, with electrons and
atoms, goes thence to chemical evolution in
the suns, inquires about the building materials
for living matter on the earth, treats of
the evolution of colloids—that bridge between
the inorganic and the organic—speculates
how life arose on earth, and considers the
living organism at work.
There is no breach of continuity between
the inorganic and the organic, or any need
for the postulation of an abrupt act of crea-
tion of the organic from the inorganic at
some definite past moment in cosmic history
which has never been repeated.
Exit Genesis.
But the evolution of life from , inorganic
materials is only one more stage more mys-
terious than, the evolution of any one form
of matter from another. The riddle of the
universe lies much deeper than life. The
riddle of the universe is the universe: why
there is matter and energy at all, and gen-
erally why things happen, and why
there happened to be things that could
happen, and what would have hag-
pened if there hadn’t. The scientist
stands now on the verge of the discovery that
all the elements are derived from one form
of stuff only, which may not be matter itself,
but when tenanted, or dossed in. or haunted,
by something called energy, becomes con-
verted into forms of matter leading up to the
elements first unearthed by the scientist. So,
in investigating the genesis of life we must
go back to the birth of electrons and atoms.
The good old doctrines of the conservation of
matter, and of the conservation of energy,
which assert that neither matter nor energy
can be created or destroyed, must now be
hurled overboard. We are now told that
each chemical element represents a moVe or
less stable position in the charging of matter
With energy. Instead of matter and energy
being fixed in amount and always conserved,
they are mutually convertible into each
other. Then is there any place in the uni-
verse where energy is forming matter out of
the alleged ether? Yes, in the hottest suns
and in gaseous nebula?. Here, in all proba-
bility, matter is to-day being created, which
may ultimately lead up to the John Smith of
millions of centuries ahead. And the study
of radio-activity has disclosed intermediate
stages between the chemical atom and the
unformed pre-matter, or luminiferous ether
—whatever that is. The alpha and beta,
particles of radio-activity form the initial
stages in the synthesis of matter which
reaches/up ultimately to you
These primeval beginnings of the transmu-
tations of matter and energy, with the for-
mation of the proto-elements, are illustrated
by the present stages of the developments of
w-rMc, pcj seen bv the astronomer, in the
constellations of all ages which surround
this world of ours.
Jt
Despite the high cost of living and labor
troubles, Nature is still at her old job
The stellar evidence, of the synthesis of
matter and the creation of worlds leaves the
position entirely untenable that life came by
a single creative unrelated act upon this
earth, or on any other earth from which it
was carried to ours. Life is at present orig-
inating in countless other worlds as daily it
is upon our own ; and, given a
certain state in evolution when matter has
reached a certain complexity in structure,
and becomes tenanted by certain types of
energy, life must come, and having come must
evolve into higher and higher forms.
Coming a long stage further, all life on
the earth depends upon two simple factors:
(1) the presence of a mere trace of carbon-
dioxide in the air, and (2) the natural power
of the carbon atom contained in the carbon-
dioxide of entering into energy relations
with fellow carbon atoms. But an energy-
transformer is needed, and this is found in
the green plant-cell and its green-coloring
matter, chlorophyll. And the energy which
is by this machine converted into chemical
energy of organic compounds is simply sun-
light. But, of course, life had an immense
amount of experimentation to go through
before it managed to produce so complex a
thing as a green plant-cell. The colloids fill
the gap. All living structures consist of
colloids. And the investigation of colloids,
begun only 50 years ago, has been prosecuted
with vigor only during the last decade. This
is the most promising of all the modern
spheres of research into the problem of life.
The author devotes to colloids a brilliant
chapter.
J*
If a mental picture be conjured up of a
world in which there is as yet no life, but
where conditions are suitable for life to
appear, it is evident that a spontaneous pro-
duction of such a thing as even a bacterium
or other unicellular organism would by no
means solve the problem : the new-born cell
would have no organic pabulum, and must
perish. The production of anything so com-
plex as chlorophyll at such a stage is un-
thinkable to anyone acquainted with the
I subtle continuity of all nature. In such a
.World inorganic colloids must first develops,
and in time one of these must begin to
evolve, not a living cell, not anything so coni"
plex as a micro-coccus or a bacillus, not even
a complex protein, carbohydrate, or fat, but
some quite simple form of organic molecule,
holding a higher store of chemical energy
than the simple bodies from which it was
formed. To carry out such a function, the
inorganic colloid must possess the property
of transforming sunlight, or some other form
of radiant energy, into chemical energy.
Later, such simple organic compounds, by
the agency of the same or some other colloid,
and with a supply of external energy, would
begin to condense and form more complex
organic molecules, and finally complexes of
inorganic and organic matter would come
into existence as crystallo-colloids. In this
way, without any hiatus life would be led up
to and inaugurated.
You see how simple the whole matter is 1
But Moore states that the search for such an
inorganic transformer is not without a hope-
ful outlook. Selenium, formaldehyde and
other substances are suggested. But how
did inorganic matter —the indispensable foun-
dation upon which organic life had to be
built —emerge? Yet as soon as the tempera-
ture of the earth allowed, sufficient complexity
of chemical structure for life to be borne on
the earth, then life appeared. The sponta-
neous production of life lies far below the
level of bacteria ; it lies at a level possessing
a lower unit than the living cell. There we
must, perforce, leave the problem.
It was no fortuitous combination of
chances, and no cosmic dust, which brought
life to the womb of our ancient mother earth
in the far distant Palaeozoic ages, but a well-
regulated orderly development, which comes
to every mother earth in the Universe in the
maturity of her creation when the conditions
arrive within the suitable limits. Given the
presence of matter and energy forms under
the proper conditions, life must come inevi-
tably.... The beginning of life was not a
fortuitous event occurring millions of years
ago. and never again repeated, but one which
in its primordial stages keeps on repeating
itself all the time and in our generation. So
that, if all intelligent creatures were by some
holocaust destroyed, up out of the depths in
I process of millions of years intelligent beings
would once more emerge.
So that if the defeat of the Labor party,
or the invasion of the atmosphere by some
gas poisonous to all life, or some other horrible
world-catastrophe wiped us all out, in a few r
millions of years inorganic colloids would
becomes stable, bacilli would arrive, the
pterodactyl and the aeroplane would event-
uate, and new Napoleons, O’Dowds, O’Mal-
leys, grocers, Kaisers and “Bellerives” would
ravage the new virgin earth. The prospect
is comforting.
Novels
Oliver Onions has written a sequel to his
fine psychological study, In Accordance with
the Evidence. This story, it may be re-
membered. told of the murder of a “rotter”
of a London clerk by his fellow clerk, his
rival in love. The Dehit Account (Bell, per
Dyinock’s Library) is an equally sincere
piece of psychology. And, though a sequel,
the book is in itself complete. Taking up
the story four years after the carefully
planned murder, which the coroner, in
accordance with the evidence, brought in as
a case of suicide for sufficient reasons,
Onions tells of the marriage of the capable
murderer with the unsuspecting girl, of his
rapid rise to wealth, of the confession he
made to another girl who loved him, and
of the growing necessity he felt of the need,
for his soul’s sake, of a complete confession
to his wife. The character drawing is vivid
and realistic, and there are scenes, such as
that of the night walk the murderer took
with the girl who suspected, that are packed
with the utmost pathos and irony. The
deyelopniebt of the man’s instinct to confess
is done with remarkable sureness of touch.
Oliver Onions shows a continual upward
development in his patient art. Ultimately
he must be taken notice of; but, so far, the
reading public has not discovered him.
&
WO% is the curious title of a good sea-
yarn by Maurice Drake (Methuen), the
author of The Salving of a Derelict and
Wrack. It is a scientific mystery- and
adventure-story. The title is the chemical
formula for wolframite or tungsten dioxide,
a deposit of which is discovered in the shape
of mud in Holland. A small company is
engaged in secretly shipping the valuable
stuff, worth £240 a ton, to England, under
the pretence that it is ballast; for the pub-
lication of the news of such immense de-
posits would ruin the market. A' rival
German company appears; and there is plot
and counter-plot, adventure and love-making.
The heroine is a suffragette, delightfully
drawn. When she finds that even a suf-
fragette can be caught by love, she exclaims:
“This love —this awful love ! There seems
no escape. Haven’t I seen the hateful thing
everywhere? In the laboratory, watched
through the microscope the rushing together
of tiniest live atoms —shameless little beasts!
Haven’t 1 1 seen how all the scheme of life
was tangled no with it, till even I was almost
afraid. Afraid, I tell you ! Blown pollen in
the moving grasses—bees in the flowers—
cell seeking cell everywhere—all telling the
same thing....l wouldn’t love; I swore I
wouldn’t. There is so much to be done for
women, and they themselves won’t •do it.
They’ll never do it. They can’t.* They swear
to devote themselves to the cause, and—and
then a man lays hands on them, and where
are their vows? A man holds them and
kisses them, and all’s over.... Oh, the
shame of it! Here am I, crying on a man’s
shoulder like any housemaid.... And I
wouldn’t be anywhere else foif worlds!
That’s- the worst of it....A1l I can spare
the cause is a fit of crying and some regrets.
Oh, I’m a Judas!.... But I’ll have my 30
pieces of silver. Kiss me on the nose again.
You dear.”
Here is Jeffery Farnol again, with The
Amateur Gentleman (Low. Marsden, per
George Robertson, Sydney), “in which
(Chapter One) Barnabas knocks down his
father, though as dutifully as may be,” and
“in which (Chapter Five) the historian sees
fit to introduce a lady of quality ; and, fur-
ther, relates how Barnabas tore a wonderful
bottle-green coat,” and (Chapter Six) “ 0 f
the bewitchment of black eyelashes; and of
a fateful lace handkerchief,” and much more
including this of the lady of quality : ’
“Motionless stood Barnabas with eyes
that wandered from the small polished rid-
ing-boot with its delicately spurred heel, to
follow’ the gracious line that swelled volup-
tuously from knee to rounded hip, that sank
in sweetly to a slender waist, yet rose again
to the rounded beauty of her bosom.”
Adventures,.fights, horses, persons of qual-
ity, clothes, deliberately quaint “vulgar”
characters, and girl—-all in the time of Beau
Nash: 599 pages....and what more, does
the library subscriber want? Farnol is well
set on the broad highway of popularity.
This paper has been entertaining
children unaware. “Patricia Murchison,”
the pen-name" of the author of the
charming place-poem, “Ivarela Hill,”
which came only second to “Mathin-
na,” in the recent competition, is just 16
years old. At the age of 12 she wrote a
poem which, after keeping for two years, she
sent to The Bulletin. The Editor paid
her 8s. Gd. for it, and published it last year.
It is quite a nice poem. Altogether this
paper, of course quite ignorant of the youth
of its correspondent, has blithely accepted
and paid for nine of her verses, and in the
issue that contained “Ivarela Hill” two other
verses by her appeared. She affects a variety
of pen-names ; but has decided henceforth to
be true to “Patricia Murchison.” The Aus-
tralian youngster has already been offered a
position in journalism in Melbourne.
The Round Table for March (Aust.
Agent, Macmillan, 109 Ilussell-street, Melb..
2s. 6d.), contains the most succinct state-
ment of British policy and sea-power yet
enunciated. This admirable quarterly is
-worth buying, and especially worth filing, by
all who desire an unbiassed setting-forth of
Imperial problems. For the scientific,
Science Progress (Murray, 5s. quarterly)
affords varied technical up-to-date pabulum.
But for the literary there is no other maga-
zine in the English-speaking world which
has the virility, the daring, and the literary
standard of the monthlv English Review
(Is.).
THE OLD RED ROAD.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
There are myriad lights on the great white
road,
And a voice that bids me stay.
And the hoofs ring on where the white
stones glance,
And the wheels sing on where the white
lights dance
When the face of the world grows gray;
But my heart beats back to the old, red road
A hundred miles away.
Oh, my feet are set in the great icliite road,
And my face is turned that way;
But when white lamps burn, and the roar
has ceased.
In mg dreams I turn to the twilit East,
And I tread on the rough, red clay.
Oh, the dusk falls soft on the old. red road
A hundred miles away.
Oh, my feet are set in the great white road,
And I march while it is day;
Yet T backward look, when the march is slow,
For the road I took in the long-ago
Is behind. And I may not stay;
But my wilful heart mourns the old, red road
A hundred miles away.
There are myriad lights on the great white
road.
And a voice that calls me — “Btay!”
But the inland breeze whispers down to me
With the sound of trees and a melody
That the breeze and the grasses play,
When the dusk comes down on the old, red
road
A hundred miles away.

Notice
The Proprietors of Kriischen Salts, of Manchester,
England, desire to make it known that owing to
the initiative and enterprise of a well-known
Sydney Merchant, who visited England last
autumn, Kriischen Salts can now be obtained
from Chemists and Stores throughout the Com-
monwealth. Kriischen Salts have an enormous
sale “ at home,” thousands of people take them
in preference to undergoing the cure at a
European Spa. Australians are confidently
invited to make a personal test of the health-
giving properties of these wonderful salts.
Kriischen Salts are extensively used and widely
prescribed by the most critical clienttle m the
whole world, —the British Medical it acuity.
A month’s course of Kriischen Salts
—at a cost of 2s. —is a splendid alter-
native for those who find it inconvenient
to undergo the treatment at a Con-
tinental Spa. With the “ Kriischen ”
treatment you can follow your daily
avocation and feel the benefit day by
day— eating better, digesting your
food better, working better, and
sleeping better.
Constipation and all the evils
which follow in its train will yield to
the magic effects of Kriischen Salts.
Gont, Rheumatism, Lumbago,
Eczema, Liver and Kidney disorders
can be overcome by the judicious use
of Kriischen Salts if taken in time.
Kriischen Salts is a most effective
internal cleanser. It cleans the
organs thoroughly, and imparts a feeling
of brightness, vivacity, and vigour which
is the result of the robust health it
engenders. Pessimism, depression,
headache, and the multitude of evils
arising from a system overcharged with
Uric Acid are completely dispersed by
a course of Kriischen Salts.

“Mimosa”: John Cooke, the meat exporter, in an
interview recently in Maoriland, stated that Queens-
land beef had deteriorated, and he cited in proof the
steady fall in the average weight of carcases. He
attributes this to the failure of Queensland cattle-
men to pay the price the Argentine estancieros are
offering for the best-bred bulls. Cooke is not the
only person who begins to have a poor opinion of
our cattle. Writer has just received a letter from
the leading shorthorn breeder in S’Africa. Inter alia
he states: “We import only the best Cruickshank
shorthorns we can get in Great Britain... .To be
candid, Australia is about the last place I would
think of importing a shorthorn from. That country
never yet imported an outstanding shorthorn; if so,
there is no record of it. 1 have seen a large number
of photos, of winning shorthorns at Australian shows,
including those of , and though they are the
best Australia has, I would not breed from them.”
Not pleasant comment; but the steady slump in the
weight of the carcases put through the works seems
to prove that it is just.

“E.R.”: Australia’s Director of Fisheries has
been opening some enticing prospects to trawlers.
He has recently been exploring the Great Australian
Bight, and in his last trip caught fish with a trawl
at the rate of 3041 b. an hour. Reckoning the value
at 4d. per lb., and working, say, 16 hours a day, this
would mean £BO. The expenses per day would be
£lO or £l2. Two days’ steaming from Adelaide
would bring one to the fishing grounds, which is
marvellous in consideration of the fact that trawlers
from Hull and Grimsby (Eng.) go close on 2000
miles to the fishing-grounds, and the fishing-grounds
in the Bight are, mile for mile, as rich as those in
the North Sea.

“Quarter Single”: The Prahran (Melb.) garbage
destructor, which has superseded the frowsy and fear-
some corporation tip, would have served Ruskin as
a text for a new “Ethics of the Dust.” It devours
daily 29 tons of mixed garbage, and returns to the
local council nearly £lOOO a year, amassed by the
sale of paving and building substances, of which
its dust and ashes form the raw material. The old
tip was a pestilence; the destructor is a mere brick
chimney in the midst of lawns. The firemen who
shovel the rubbish into the furnaces make queer
discoveries. Empty bottles are their perquisites as
a matter of right; but they find also stray articles
of jewellery, spoons, forks and cutlery, an occa-
sional coin, and it is on record that a dead monkey
and portion of a human leg were among the treasure
trove. The leg was believed to be that of a woman,
portion of whose anatomy had been sent to a doctor
for clinical purposes. Had it not been discovered,
it might have been worked up into asphalt, or formed
part of the rough-cast fronting a suburban villa resi-
dence. The monkey was boiled away to dust.

“Gouger”: I’ll tell you what “blind-stabbing” is.
First you find your creek, then carry picks, shovels,
streaming boxes, hammer, drills, gelignite, and the
few other accessories of the tin scratcher’s business.
Step into the cold, muddy water, until it reaches just
over your belt, then bend down and scrape and
root at the rocks under water with the pick. Pre-
sently you strike a stone, weighing half a ton or so.
All efforts to dislodge it with the pick being un-
availing, you get the hammer and drill and proceed
to bore a hole in it. That accomplished, sooner or
later (generally later), you proceed to put in the
gelignite, then the fuse, and light it. After that
you run for the nearest tree, where you remain until
the conclusion of the submarine volcano. Back in the
water, you take the shovel and proceed to scrape
up all the dirt you have dislodged. An amateur will
mostly bring up a spoonful at a time. Then you
clean the miserable little heap of resurrected muck,
and get from 2jlb. to 41b. of tin out of it for the
day’s work. Tin is worth fully Is. Id. per lb. It’s
a great profession.
Hugh Enden : Saturday’s betting had been
profitable, and on Sunday Patrick Jericho, the book
-maker, beguiled the time on a canvas chair on the
hotel verandah. He dozed and dreamed and at last
Rb asleep. In his contortions two or three sover-
eigns fell from his trousers pocket on to the chaj-.
where they remained as he rose to depart. A
youth, seeing the coins, picked them up and prolfered

that packages of imported shoddy are being pushed
under its nose as shoddy, and sold to the Australian
public as genuine goods. For instance, packages of
socks or undervests are branded on the outside cover
as .< cottc# and woo l,” while the article inside is
branded “all wool.” There’s a line of men’s socks
branded thus, and being sold to the retailer at 6s. od.

articles cost about 3d. a pair in England. Dunno

Ll*ou : I wish the Minister for Home Affairs
would pass a Doorstep Saving bill. Mine is getting
worn out. As a housewife ot two years standing, i
testily that in that period I have spent two
weeks at the door telling various assorted bores that
J don t want to buy their idiotic wares, or sample
them, or enter into any hire-purchase contract with
anybody that I don t gainble to the extent ot a six-
penny lottery ticket, and that 1 m not in a mood to
help build churches, or dogs dormitories. Personally
1 am badly handicapped by the 1 otter having turned
me out of His mould without enough aggressiveness
to give any caller the hump or cold feet. The door-
step destroyers may be classified — (a) Commerce,
(b) Charity. Against the brass front and ' brass
throat of class a I hold out as long as I can. Then,
if they won’t believe I am penniless and can’t buy (it
never occurs to them I don’t want to buy, no matter
how 1 protest), I take down the old worn purse I
keep behind the door for their benefit, and show them
my all, two half-pennies and a penny, or two pennies
and a half, as the case may be. Then, if they wont
sell me the grand piano or whatever it is for that,
they have to get. Occasionally they sell me other
goods to the value of (they say) Is. or Is. 6d. for
the stock of coppers. And then I have to replenish
the purse. Class b is harder to deal with. It is
always horribly long-winded, greasily pious and ser-
vile, and, if female, consistently dowdy. An obstinate
Salv’armist drove me to invent a method of dealing
with Charity. (Recipe for same appended for benefit
of suffering sisters.) She (the Army lass) was so
moved I thought she’d weep all over the new front
doormat, and I could smell the steak burning in the
kitchen. So now I always keep a few leaves of mv
husband’s cheque-book on hand (I have no bank ac-
count of my own), and, if the collector won’t go
quietly, I simply fill in one for a generous amount,
s j gn m y Christian name in full, and give it to the
gra teful cadger with my blessing. It works like a
c harm. The caller departs with gracious brevity, and
; reburrl to work experiencing all the blesssdness of
having given in abundance,

“Kobbi”: It tickles my third rib when I see the
advts. of the seedsmen stating that only this season s
seeds are stocked. To force this alleged fact on to
my dull attention he shows me with smiling pride
that each packet of seeds is marked in glaring red
the date 1918. He protests that all of last years
unsold stock is sent back to headquarters and de
stroyed. And when I plant the wretched seeds
they won’t grow, and then drop in on the seedsman
to point out that each packet contains a plain packet
inside—unmarked, of course—and that to tool the
public only the outside cover need fl b ® n r ™° a V dLtrov er
fresh one substituted, he votes me a bo ™\ a des ‘ rd ' e "

During the Half-year the branches in-Wictoria at Melton, Thoona and Wangerr.p were converted
into agencies, and the agency at Lavers' Hill established as a branch. The agencies at Myrniong
and Lindenow were closed. In South Australia an agency was opened at Prospect.
To the great regret of his colleagues and the management, the Honorable .1. M. Pratt found it
necessary, owing to ill-health, to resign his seat onthe Board, and it is desired to place on record the
high appreciation in which the honorable gentleman’s services as a director of the bank for nearly 22
years are held. His wide experience and sound judgment were at all times of great benefit to the
institution.
The vacancy on the Board thus caused was filled, in accordance with the authority conferred on the
directors by the articles of association,, by the appointment of J. Newman Barker, Esq., well known in
Australian business circles as late chief inspector' of the New Zealand Loan and Mercantile Agency
Company, Limited, and now an Australian director of that company.
At the Ordinary General Annual Meeting, to be held at the Board room of the Bank, Collins Street,
■ Melbourne, on Wednesday, 7th May, at noon, the shareholders will be called upon to elect two directors
ij n lieu of Hugh Murrav Strachan and .1. Newman Barker, Esquires, who retire by rotation, in accord-
ance with the articles of association, and are eligible for re-election. There are no other candidates.
The shareholders will also be Called upon to elect two auditors for the ensuing year.

His brain can’t stand the strain it’s built to remember
facts, not figures. The human mind is never completely
accurate, The National Cash Register thinks with a brain
of steel. It keeps track of every detail, of every sale, stops
leaks, losses, mistakes, prevents carelessness and dishonesty.
A store using a National Cash Register is a good store—
it’s run on system—it’s bound to give you “money’s worth.”
A merchant should be as sure of getting all the MONEY for
the goods he sells as the customer is sure he gets the goods
for which he pays. A National Cash Register enforces
a CORRECT record which cannot be lost, changed or
destroyed. A National Cash Register safeguards each
sale AS IT TAKES PLACE and assures you of getting
all your money for the goods you sell. It will pay you to
investigate. Nearly a million-and-a-quarter merchants are
using National Cash Registers.

FLAT-CHESTED WOMEN!
Misfortune may have been your lot in so far as natural de-
velopment was concerned, but science has found a way to cor-
rect your deficiency. Even though you have never been full-
bosomed, and although you have been attenuated all your
life, if you suffer from no wasting disease your bosom can be
fully developed and your weight increased to normal.
It is the refreshing firmness and delightful fulness of the
feminine form that captivates, and the woman who is most
perfectly developed is the one who monopolises the endear-
ments of the opposite sex.
No woman need stay thin and undeveloped. Dr. Falliere’s
Flesh-Food is a harmless, perfect, flesh-builder. It increases
the vitality and improves the general health. Some cases re-
port a gain in weight of over five pounds a week. Send 2d.

On the Parramatta.
lis June in England, and England’s June
Is richer by one girl-rose in you ;
Yet, somehow, the days sing out of tune
And the sunsets burn with a sober hue
Since you said “Good-bye” to the Parra-
matta.
I saw a face in the street to-day
So like your face that it made me start,
And all of a sudden the noon turned grey,
For it set me thinking of you, Dear Heart.
How strange the power of this soul of ours
That holds one chained in a busy street,
And sets him thinking of songs and flowers —
Long dead, long muted —but still, how
sweet!
I, think of you, not as you loved to dress,
In silks nnd satins and laces rare, -
And jewels—a diamond cross (no less)
Arid a hat that hid too much of your hair.
No. no, I think of you, dear, as you sat,
A laughing girl on a boat’s mid-seat,
With tossed hair under a prisoning hat,
And round, bare arms in the sun and fhe
heat,
By a terraced shore of the Parramatta.
I’d paint you just as you were that day,
If I had the artist-gift that I need,
And men would look at my work and say-
“He dipped his brush in his heart indeed.”
How still it was on that afternoon!
The busy winds were asleep, I think ;
The river iay in a golden swoon.
A blue crane dreaming upon its brink.
For one such hour it was good to live,
And three such hours were our lot sub-
lime ;
It lay with Nature —the power to give
A fitting close to that glorious time.
<
She gave it: flooding the world with gold,
And painting the landscape—reach and
rise—
Till the hour seemed fuller than it could
%' hold
(Of glory poured from the western skies.
What spilt wine reddened the rounded cove?
Why rose the music from feathered
throats?
Whence flowed the purple and gold above?
What ailed the sails of the fishing boats?
The far clouds flamed with a fire intense
Till, mute and breathless, we gazed at
last
Enslaved bv beauty in soul and sense
Yet soon, Dear Heart.... to soon it
passed—
That sunset hour on the Parramatta.

The Sweater Girl.
The sweater girl is featly drest,
Her curves are full and fair,
The simple hat that suits her, best
Is soft about Jier hair,
The modest ro midness of her breast
A queen had loved to wear.
When Mabel, in her cosy pride
And simple ribbon bright,
Sits out beside the rippling tide
And all the stars are white,
I know that she is warm inside
However cold the night.
No sharpest tooth of biting breeze
May pierce her warm heart through,
She shivers not for all that seas
And winter airs can do,
For soft wool holds her by the knees
*- And wraps her from the dew.
We sit beside a watchful tree,
And none may work us harm ;
I know not how she looks on me,
But both her lips are warm,
And I can feel about me free
The royndness of her arm.
The keen airs blowing down the‘bay
Are very good to taste,
The lighted steamers glide away
With decency and haste—
I never knew until to-day
The wonder of her waist. ' '
The sweater girl is featly drest,
Her curves are fair to see,
With winter’s chilly fingers prest
She goes erect and free,
The modest roundness of her breast
Is melody to me.

Old Letters.
There are just two dozen of them, and
they’re nothing much to see,
For their writing’s rather scrawly and their
spelling somewhat free,
But there’s still a touch of heartache in
their faded lines for me.
Their diction’s hardly lofty, they are phrased
in language plain,
Though in some there throbs a passion, and
in some there sobs a nain,
But they all were writ in longing, and they
all were penned in vain.
And some are dark with anger, and some
are bright with wit,
For Molly’s mind was Irish, and Irish fan-
cies lit
The page where rests the tear-stain, more
dear because of it.
And, spite of blot or blemish, or aught that
V. may occur,
U hold those crumpled pages more Choice
than rose or mvrrh,
Or pearls of poet’s rapture, because they
came from her.
And though the world holds laughter and
many voices call,
And hope with clear lips smiling stands
beckoning and tall,
One bunch of faded letters is more to me
than all.

How to Address Letters.
Correspondents to The Bulletin would oblige the
paper (and, to an extent, themselves) by taking some
care as to methods of address.
Business letters (with regard to subscriptions, ad-
vertisements. etc.) should in no case be addressed to
the Editor, but to the Manager. To send them to
the Editor is to invite inattention.
It is not a good thing to address editorial letters
to anyone by name. “The Editor, The Bulletin,” is
the proper superscription for “copy.” Delay, and
even loss, is sometimes caused by addressing to per-
sons instead of officials. The person may not be
there; the official always is.

THE TRANSCONTINENTAL RAIL-
WAY AGAIN.
Many a bad cause is kept afloat for a long
while by the dull, plodding reiteration of a
very ordinary lie. There need not be any
evidence behind the lie —in fact, it is often
better that there should be none. The
bogus character of false evidence can be
found out, but the bogus character of no
evidence at all is harder to prove. Thus
the old Egyptian preacher in Kingsley’s
book told Philammon, the monk, to bellow
at Hypatia, the heathen philosopher girl,
and call her bad names, but on no account
to argue with her. In a poor cause it is
always safest to assert, to declare, to lay
down assurances with a thud, to yell, de-
nounce, blither, excommunicate and hit the
table hard. And it is in this s<>rt of fashion
that the case for the crooked and devious
railway across Australia is usually sup-
ported as against the straight line through
the heart of the Continent, though now and
then there is a disastrous attempt to prop
up the case with evidence. So far, the great
effort of the Brisbane and Sydney Tory
papers is to drag the transcontinental rail-
way—which will almost cease to be a trans-
continental railway in such a case —close
up to their own doors. The Adelaide papers
want, in like fashion, to bring it to their
own doors. The unanimous conviction of
these organs that its own door is the right
door raises a natural suspicion of self-
interest. It recalls the Federal capital scrim-
mage, when each Federal member in N.S.W.
was bursting with unbiassed conviction that
the proposed site in his electorate was the
only site that any reasonable man could con-
sider. Just about here The Bulletin en-
deavors to stand in a category by itself. It
seeks to flock separately, so to speak. Its
own front door is in Sydney, and the said
door is quite as clean and respectable as
that of the S. M. Herald or Telegraph or
Evening News. But this paper tries (o re-
gard all Australia as its door, and doesn’t
feel bound to swear that the bit of brown
wood down in the front stomach of its build-
ing is the centre of all things. Because of
this effort to be Australian it advocates the
straight railway across the Australian con-
tinent. On the same principle it couldn’t
bring itself, as the Sydney dailies mostly
did, to swear that Canberra was the ideal
Australian capital, though among the various
sites proposed that one was nearest to its
place'off business and its bit of freehold.
On the transcontinental railway subject
the S. M. Herald broke out the other day
in a vigorous fashion. For instance, it
clamored to this effect: —
It is important to attempt to get this Northern
Territory of ours into its proper perspective. It has
an area of 525,000 square miles, or nearly one-fifth
of the Commonwealth, and one-third larger than
New South Wales. At present it is, to all intents and
purposes, uninhabited. Now, even if no additional
disadvantages present themselves, of which we are
not yet aware, it is going to take many millions of
money even moderately to settle the Northern Ter-
ritory. There; is no use going in for half-measures.
South Australia did that, and failed in consequence.
How terrible was her failure only those in that State
realise. Not only did they place a millstone round
their State Treasurer’s neck, but piled up a debt
that would have comnletelv strangled them financially
had not the Commonwealth come to a timely rescue.
They had their two little lines of railway ending
nowhere in the desert. The line from Port Darwin
to Pine Creek took on the average two passengers
per train, which ran every second day, one day down
and the other up, through 150 miles of anthills and
spinifex. At the other end, from Hergott Springs
to Oodnadatta, the position was, if anything, still
worse, for it did not carry on the average a single
passenger per day. We want no repetition of this
kind of thing.
* * * *
For some reason or another this proposi-
tion that S.A. was a ruined place because
of the Territory, and that the Common-
wealth took over its biggest liability out of
charity, is one of the stock arguments in
favor of the crooked railway, though it isn’t
easy to see where it comes in. Certainly
S.A. took the management of the Territory
when the less patriotic or less enterprising
State of N.S.W. refused to be responsible
for it any longer. In a burst of fresh young
enthusiasm and gilded ambition, it pre-
vented -mbre than one-sixth of Australia
becoming a nigger-infested Crown Colony,
probably controlled from Calcutta, and by
so doing it made White Australia possible.
Certainly it didn’t, during its comparatively
short term of control, do very much more
for the Territory than N.S.W. did during its
much longer occupancy —the occupancy which
ended in the final collapse and surrender by
the Ma State. Yet S.A. built a bit of railway,
while N.S.W. built nothing. Furthermore,
it must be admitted that S.A., during its
comparatively brief administration of the
Territory, had just about as poor luck in
the matter of settlement as N.S.W. is
having to-dav. and has always had, with its
own North-West. And S.A. certainly got
into debt—the Territory’s debt alone, for
which S.A. was responsible, ran to over
£3,000,000. Still, the Crow-Eater’s Province
always paid its way, and even before it got
rid of the Northern “incubus,” as the Tory
press is so fond of calling that great asset,
it wasn’t so deeply involved as either
Queensland or Westralia. So it is an absurd
lie to sav that it was “strangled financially,”
unless it is claimed that these two States
were strangled also. The Territory, until
the Commonwealth took it over, had an an-
nual deficit; but that is the normal condition
of Northern Westralia, of Western Queens-
land, of all N.S.W. west of the Darling, and
very often of whole States. There was
one sorrowful year, not so very long since,
when the only States' which hadn’t a deficit
were Westralia and South Australia (with
its Northern Territory incubus). The Terri-
tory’s railway certainly didn’t pay, and
doesn’t pay even now, but that is the normal
condition of more of the N.S.W. railways
than one cares to remember. Some people
might reckon that when a N.S.W. railway,
located close to the city of Sydney, earns
£10.451 in a year, and spends £10,435 on
working costs, and is liable for £14,116 in
interest, the case is so bad that it is unwise
to say too much about anybody else’s bit of
iron road. And it is doubtless true, as
alleged in the S. M. Herald’s plea for the
crooked railway, that the Territory will cost
a heap of money before it is adequately
settled. All Australia cost a heap of money
in the work of settlement. So, for that mat-
ter. did England and the globe generally. In
fact, many people think it would have been
a lot of money in Adam’s pocket if he had
never been created.
Again, to quote the S. M. Herald, still
clamoring for the line that will take the
shortest possible route to its own ill-painted
office-door: —
In South Australia it was desired by a large sec-
tion of the people to stipulate for the junction of the
Oodnadatta-Pine Creek line right through the dead
heart of the continent. But it was realised that
this was not a matter to be left to the desires of any
particular State, for the interests of all should be
considered, seeing that all would be called upon to
pay. An alternative route crosses into Queensland, in
the neighborhood of the Herbert River, where it can
be tapped by the Townsville-Cloncurry, the Roclc-
hampton-Longreach, and further south by the Bris-
bane-Charleville lines. It will then cross into South
Australia, in the vicinity of Birdsville, where it
could be linked up to the New South Wales system
by a line from Bourke, and possibly by another
from Broken Hill, joining the main South Australian
system somewhere about Hergott Springs. The pre-
sent commission will report upon these two schemes.
The latter, as Mr. Harper pointed out in his evi-
dence last week, is the longer bv nearly 300 miles,
but it has the advantage of bringing Port Darwin
just on 800 miles nearer to Sydney, and 1500 miles
nearer to Brisbane, as well as somewhat nearer to
Melbourne, the three great centres of population from
which troops' would undoubtedly have to be drawn
in case of trouble. Its strategical advantages are
thus great.
After all, it is a question whether, when the
general interests of Australia are concerned,
the alleged “dead heart of the continent” is
anything like as dead as the heart of the
S. M. Herald. It is quite possible that
Harper, above quoted, felt called upon, as
a N.S.W. official, to give a kind of guarded
support to the long coastal line which would
connect Port Darwin with the S. M. Her-
ald’s office at Sydney by a rather’ shorter
route than the transcontinental track would
do. But he didn’t say, as the Herald seems
to think, that the crooked line via the Her-
ald office, would bring’ Melbourne nearer to
Darwin than the straight route via Ade-
laide. In fact, he showed that the route via
Adelaide (2379 miles) would be about 40
miles shorter than the one via the Herald
office (2419 miles). This is surely the kind
of misrepresentation that a pious paper
shouldn’t be guilty of.
Also, the suggestion that it is essential to
connect the “empty North” by the shortest
possible route with Brisbane, Sydney and
Melbourne, because these are “the three
great centres of population from which
troops would undoubtedly have to be drawn
in case of trouble,” for the defence of the
Territory, is another thing that a holy pub-
lication shouldn’t be guilty of, no matter how
urgent the desire to get the great Federal
railway brought to its own city. Adelaide
is a much greater centre of population than
Brisbane—at last census it had 189,646
people against Brisbane’s 139,480. It is
growing faster, its increase inside ten years
being 27,385 against Brisbane’s 20,052.
This growth may not be to Adelaide’s credit,
but if it is a question of “three great centres
of population” from which to draw soldiers
for the defence of the North, then Adelaide
and not Brisbane is the place to be con-
sidered. Furthermore, Adelaide is nearer
to Darwin, the great port of the Territory,
than Brisbane. It is much nearer to the
most adjacent point of the Territory than
Brisbane. And when the Territory is really
in danger Adelaide will have troops to spare
while Brisbane won’t, and Melbourne may
have troops to spare when Sydney has none.
When the ill-guarded North is menaced it
must be by sea, and when the enemy is in
possession of Torres Straits he will be so
near to Townsville, Rockhampton and Bris-
bane that these places will be fully occupied
with their own affairs. Adelaide, Melbourne
and Perth, being the last, capital cities on
the mainland that an Asiatic invader could
reach by sea. might have men to spare, and
they might do good service if there was a
railway by which they could shove their re-
inforcements swiftly into the North ; but the
northern cities would have big troubles of
their own sitting on their chests just then.
In other words, when the North is attacked,
its best chance of assistance, provided there
is a sane railway system to bring that assist-
ance, is from the big centres which are
nearest to it by land and farthest from it by
water. These are Melbourne. Adelaide and
Perth. The last-named, by the way, is
almost as large a city as Brisbane and its
population is growing much faster.
* * * *
A curious argument advanced by the
people who want to break the agreement un-
der which South Australia handed over the
Territory, and to abandon the transconti-
nental idea, and to divert the great Federal
railway, with much extra length and ex-
pense, round by the S. M. Herald’s office
door, is that the proposed deviation would
give the Northern Territory port the quickest
possible access to Townsville, Rockhampton
and Brisbane. Consequently, Harper, of
the N.S.W. Railway Department, appeared
before the Northern Territory Railways and
Ports Commission; and, unless some of the
Sydney papers slandered him grievously,
submitted this table of distances :
By the crooked
line deviating
By the straight through the
Port Darwin to line. Eastern States.
Adelaide . . . . 1896 . . 2172
Melbourne . . . . 2379 . . 2419
Sydney .. . . 2961 .. 2206
Brisbane . . . . 3686 . . 2143
Rockhamnton . . 4082 . . 1895
Townsville . . 4492 . . 1565
A lot of these figures—especially those con-
cerning Rockhampton and Townsville —are,
of course, a silly and impudent jest. They
are based on the theory that the great main
line from North to South may easily be
diverted eastward to hitch on to the local
railways from Rockhampton and Towns-
ville, and also Brisbane ; but that for some
wholly incomprehensible reason, if the great
Federal line goes straight across the con-
tinent from North to South, these local lines
can’t be extended a little further west to
hitch on to it. As a matter of fact, if the
great main line —the line that really matters
—was built to connect the Empty North on
the shortest possible track with the nearest
big city, it would put Rockhampton and
Townsville, and even Brisbane, a very few
miles further away from Darwin than the
deviation would do. The alleged 4082 miles
from Rockhampton to Darwin, supposing the
straight line to be built, are apparently es-
tablished by measuring the distance between
the two places via Gladstone, Brisbane,
Sydney, Melbourne and Adelaide. In the
same way North Shore, Sydney, is 1400
miles from Redfern railway station, Sydney,
if you go round by Brisbane. And anybody’s
front door may be 35.000 miles from his
back door if he persists in going from one
to the other via Timbuctoo.
* * * *
It is up to the people who. clamor for the
line round towards the S. M. Herald office
to remember that, in a matter of this sort,
Townsville. Rockhampton and Brisbane
don’t really matter. Especially Towns-
ville and Rockhampton don’t matter
one deformed swear. Brisbane, as already
mentioned, is smaller than Adelaide, and not
much bigger than Perth—also, it is not
growing so fast as Adelaide or Perth. Rock-
hampton is a pleasant place, and this writer
has very pleasant recollections of it, but in
the matter of population—that is to say, in
the matter of ability to contribute men to
the defence of the Empty North —it isn’t in
the same street with .Adelaide, Perth, New-
castle, Ballarat, Bendigo, Hobart. Parra-
matta, West Maitland, Geelong, Broken Hill,
Kalgoorlie or Launceston. And Townsville
is even smaller than Rockhampton. After
these coastal towns had made some provision
for their own defence they could do far less
' to protect the Territory in the hour of
trouble than obscure inland snots such as
Mount Gambier and Gawler and a
hundred others. They are all very
bad ports, and there is no need for
wild haste to connect the splendid harbor of
the Empty North with three rotten harbors
in the North-East. The connection must
come, of course, but the first essential is to
tie up the Empty North by the .
possible route with some States that havea
shred of population to spare. And the m .
densely peopled of the Federated State*
(1) Victoria and (2) Tasmania mi,®
direct transcontinental line will supply t *
briefest line of communication with th«
States, and that is of more importance
supplying the briefest connection with three
unfortunate dishes of water—to wit R,-n
bane, Rockhampton and Townsville—in '
State that ranks last but one for density
population. J 01

THE ALLEGEDLY RUINED AND
DEFENCELESS TRUST.
The latest anti-Referendum argument ap-
pears to be that injurious trusts don’t exist
anywhere. Not only are they unknown in
Australia, but America itself is free from
them. The few that remain in the U.S. are
beneficent concerns, it would seem, for the
reason that the SiießxMan Anti-Trust Act
leaps upon them with lethal violence ami
unerring aim, the moment they start to inis
behave. Ex-Premier C. (1. Wade, 0 f
N.S.W., lately made this astonishing noini
in the S. M. Herald. In support of the
Liberal contention that the trusts in
America, as here, are perfectly innocuous
institutions, he wrote (“The Referendum”
Article vii.) as follows: —
There is a manufacturing case, the “Addyston Pipe
Trust case, in 1899, reported in 175, United States
Reports, 211.” There was an agreement of certain
iron pipe manufacturers to increase the selling price
of the pipes and to abolish competition between the
parties to the agreement. The Court held there was
an invasion of the Act, and granted an injunction.
After quoting a couple of other more or
less analogous cases, in which the Sherman
Act had been effectively employed, he went
on: —
Lastly, “the notorious Standard Oil C 0.,” after
hard fighting and many delays, was compelled to
succumb to the judgment of the Court, which granted
an injunction, and ordered the dissolution of the
trust.
The above, which are typical cases of the success-
ful operation of the anti-trust law, clearly demon-
strate that the machinery is effective,, but advocates
of the present Referendum assert that trusts are still
numerous and active in America, and that no sooner
are they apparently vanqu shed before the Courts
than they devise means for resuscitation and evasion
of the authority of the law.
In the matter of disingenuousuess the drag-
ging-in of the Addyston Pipe Trust case, in
this connection, is the limit, the absolute
brink, the extreme edge. .As an argument
it is about as justifiable as the contention
that Victor Thumper is no cricketer; be-
cause he was once bowled. Here and
there, in the United States, especially dur-
ing the first decade after the passing of
the Sherman Act, a combine, as a result
entirely of its own criminal carelessness,
has been stumped 6r thrown out or what
not. The Addyston Pipe and Steel Co. was
one of the few, the lamentably few, that fell
in in this way. The facts are simple
enough. The Addyston Co. consisted of six
corporations, whose business was the manu-
facture of steel pipes. It held a mon-
opoly in its particular line, which ex-
tended over many States of the Union.
Its intention “to monopolise or at-
tempt to, monopolise inter-State com-
merce” was frankly set out in its signed
and sealed agreement. And it was owing
solely to this ghastly and inexplicable error
that the co. came under- the operation of the
Sherman Act. Had it incorporated in
New Jersey, or Oklahoma, or South Dakota,
or West Virginia, or several other unpatri-
otic States that might be mentioned, and at
the same time time refrained from express-
ing in its agreements any intention to
monopolise inter-State commerce (while
fully meaning to do so, nevertheless) the
anti-Trust legislation of its native land
would have had no power whatever to harm
it. The classic case which points the
above moral is United States v. Knight.
Here an allegedly State Trust had been
instituted under the name-of the American
Sugar Refining Company. The members
of it were actually sugar refiners in a num-
ber of other States. However, the Trust
in its articles of agreement was careful to
announce that its only object was to make
and sell sugar within the borders of the
Trust’s State of origin. On being taken or
propelled to the Supreme Court, the Trusts
counsel took the point that there was nothing
in the articles which disclosed an intention
to monopolise the inter-State trade in sugar-
The Court agreed and ipso facto the Trust
went free. This despite the fact that, at
the time, the American Sugar Refining Co.
had control of considerably over 90 per
cent. of the total output of sugar
throughout the United States. To-day,
after 23 years’ experience of the fanures
of the Sherman Anti-Trust Act, the L.s-
Sugar Combine is one of the completes!
monopolies on earth. The nosition therefore
is, as regards the Sherman Anti-Trust Af -
that if a trust is suicidal enough to delin-
erately insert its head into a legal noose, o
if it relies on the advice of lawyers who are
so incredibly incompetent as to be
of facts which most U.S. schoolboys know
if, in short, it is one of those simple. Arca-
dian trusts that one may catch with one
hat, so to speak—in those unlikely events
will get into trouble. But if it goes to
trifling expense of registering in any one
the many States which will readily we c ,• n
it; and if it does not gratuitously men
in its articles that it is in the game
the object of monopolising all the busi
in its line, not only within its own State,
in other States as well, then neither
Sherman Act nor any other Federal m
sure can touch it. # »
The remark about the dissolution of th
Standard Oil Co. is as much calculated, u
not designed, to deceive, as is the a-
that the mishap which befell the Ad .
Pipe Trust peonle is “typical _ of the
disaster that always smites ,
bines in the United States. The Standard
Oil Co. was convicted under the - bv
Anti-Trust Act. and ordered to dissolv

in any sense which is of the - * nts idethe
to the public. Oil manufacture A <jn
combine are finding it as hard to


any good for themselves as ever, unless
reputable American* papers such as Life
and the Argonaut lie; and discoverers of
new oil-wells stand to he blackmailed as of
yore. The consensus of opinion among 90
per cent, of Americans is that the Oil Trust
has merely taken the 1931 judgment of the
Supreme Court to mean that if it can’t be
good it must at least be careful. As a
matter of fact, even Mr. Wade refrains from
explicitly committing himself to the state-
ment that this trust has dissolved: he merely
remarks darkly that it has been “ordered
to dissolve,” and passes on to other things.
One may reason that it hasn’t dissolved in
any genuine sense of the term, in much the
same absolutely reliable fashion as one may
deduce that Armageddon, though ordered,
has not yet arrived. To such gigantic pro-
portions has this Trust grown that its
actual dismemberment would be in the
nature of a cataclysm. The syndicate which
is the Standard Oil owns, amongst a num-
ber of other huge banks, the National City
Bank, which is perhaps the biggest and
richest in the world. It has controlling in-
terests in 85,000 miles of railways; in the
whole of the electric lighting, gas and rail-
way systems of New York ; and in the three
greatest insurance companies in the world.
Its wealth runs into unimaginable figures.
Spelling has faintly suggested it in these
words :
It can boom or depress the stock market at will,
and can control the call, as well as the time rates
for money borrowed on stocks. It could bring on a
financial panic within 24 hours that would cause a
thousand bankruptcies, compel an issue of Govern-
ment bonds and paralyse industry in all civilised
nations.
An institution of that magnitude does not
expire in any hole and corner way. Its
death would be a matter of burning interest
wherever people are able to read. The cable
told us that it had been officially ordered to
die two years ago. But no intimation of
the actual swallowing of the hemlock has
ever come to hand. The remains have never
been identified. Is it unreasonable, in the
circumstances, to assume that, in this, as in
a thousand other cases, the Sherman Anti-
Trust Act has proved impotent?
* * * *
Australia, under its existing Constitution,
is as indifferently equipped to deal with its
trusts as America is to control its Beef,
Sugar and Oil Combines. And this pro-
vides one of the soundest reasons for
the present Referendum campaign. There
are the closest analogies between the
plight of the two countries in this
respect. A series of High Court decisions
has indicated to the Commonwealth Parlia-
ment some of the things which it can’t do
in the way of controlling trusts ; a series of
Supreme Court decisions has taught Con-
gress a similar lesson in the United States.
The discovery by the American combines
that the Anti-Trust law will not reach them,
provided they form corporations under the
laws of individual States, and without ex-
pressing In writing the intention to monopo-
lise the commerce of other States, is paral-
leled here by the discovery, on the part of
the Beef Trust in Queensland. Tattersall’s in
Tasmania, etc., that a business concern which
registers in one State can defy the
displeasure of the Federal Parliament
for an indefinite period. The trusts
of America have always relied on gain-
ing immunity from justice by raising the
State Rights cry against their assailants:
the trusts of Australia are doing precisely
the same in this country at the present mo-
ment. The decree in the Standard Oil judg-
ments accomplished, to quote a writer auoted
last week bv Mr. Wade, “everything that it
is possible to acomplish under the Sher-
man Anti-Trust Act.” And when the
achievement is examined it is found to
amount to practically nothing. The decrees
of our Courts have accomplished everything
that is possible under our Anti-Trust legis-
lation. Which is to say, they have done
so little that they might as well have never
been formulated. It is ludicrous, in view
of the glaring facts of the case, for party
politicians to go on arguing that the United
States and Australia are equipped, to scotch
their trusts. A more useful lie is that all
trusts are unadulterated blessings. It is a
better lie, because it is so much harder to
disprove.

PLAIN ENGLISH.
The Candidates.
Owing to the casMron and boiler-metal
fashion of machine politics, there are very
few triangular contests preparing for the
coming Federal election, and not a single
quadrangular one, while such a thing as an
octagon is never heard of nowadays. Under
a more sane political system there would be
a second ballot between the two top or roof
candidates, when half a dozen men (or
women) went to the poll and no one got a
clear majority; and then any joyous person
could butt in and add to the gaiety of
nations without causing the election of his
worst enemy upon a split vote. Nowadays
there is no such joy. Out of the 75 Federal
electorates there are only 10—Cook
(N.S.W.), Macouarie (N.S.W.), Nepean
(N.S.W.), Corio (Vic.), Henty (VicQ,
Bendigo (Vic.), Indi (Vic.), Echuca (Vic.)
—the machine never works so well
in Victoria as in N.S.W. —Adelaide
(S.A.), and Denison (Tasmania) —where a
third candidate has turned up. Three men
—Frazer, of Ivalgoorlie (W.A.), and Glynn
and Archibald (both of S.A.) get in unop-
posed. Glynn was unopposed in 1910 and
in 1903; in fact, his luck is so remarkable
that a lot of his enemies say that, some dav
or other, he will die unopposed. But S.A.
has put up a marvellous record for unop-
posed elections. At the first Federal poll
the whole State was one constituency, and
everybody opposed everybody else. But in
1903 five out of the seven members had a
walk-over; in 1906 four out of seven; in
1910, three out of seven ; in 1913. two out
of seven. Each State has to elect, three
Senators. In Queensland there are six can-
didates; in N.S.W. nine; in Victoria, seven;
in S.A., six; in Westralia, six; and in Tas-
mania, seven. In the Hume (N.S.W.) Labor
hasn’t put up a pledged candidate, but allows
good old Uncle Bill Lyne to carry its ban-
ner. which he will doubtless do with credit
to himself and the banner. In Koo.vong
(Vic.) it allows Miss Vtda Goldstein to
represent it as a friendly sort of Indepen-
dent. George Wise, who is a mighty good
Democrat, humps the axe with which
loryism is to be smitten in Gipps-
land (A' ic.) ; and Labor, as already
mentioned, thought it a mere waste of ammu-
nition to fight Patbick McMahon Glynn
at Angas (S.A.). There are three lady
candidates. Ellen Mulcahy, teacher, stands
against Dr. Maloney, for Melbourne; Vida
Goldstein is up against Robekt Wallace
Best, for Kooyong (Vic.) ; and Alicia
U Shea Petersen proposes to have a run
for Denison (Tasmania). Among the 342
candidates whose occupations are recorded
m the list which this paper has received,
only one sets dqwn his work, toil, job, graft,
labor or industrial struggle as “independent
means,” and the name of the person who per-
spires at “independent means” is Willie
Kelly, of Sydney. No wonder William
bursts his collar at times. Among the rest
of the 142 there are 22 lawyers and 16 jour-
nalists, though some of the latter look a trifle
doubtful. For instance, Joseph Cook is
down as a journalist, and it is difficult to
remember a time when he made the bulk of
his income on the Inky Way. Among the
six Senatorial candidates in Queensland
three are journalists, and all the three candi-
dates who want the job of Representative
for Bendigo (Vic.) are described as “barris-
ter and solicitor.” The two candidates for
the Hunter (N.S.W.) are miners. The two
for Wannon (Vic.) are farmers. The two for
Brisbane are merchants. The two for Grey
(S.A.) are “agents.” It seems like dog
consuming dog. The names that strike the'
eye most imperatively are those of Percy
Phipps Abbott, Egbert F. S. England,
Granville de Laune Ryrie, Thomas
Drinkwater Ciiataway, Anthony James
Joseph St. Ledger, (sometimes called
Sledger for short, and sometimes called
Sludge for shorter), Arthur Elliott St.
Clair McDonald, and Cyril St. Clair
Cameron. For some reason or another
FITZ HERBERT DE PERCY and FITZCLARENCE
de Montmorency must have drawn out. But
three Smiths and a pair of Browns are
among those who will also run.

Again the Forgotten Mono-Rail.
A man who is apparently suspected of being
threatened with traces of information about
his own job—J. Haydon Oardew, presi-
dent of the Sydney University Engineering
Society—delivered an address recently which
contained some valuable points. This, for
instance, is from the Sydney Telegraph
report:—
“Speed is becoming the necessity of civilised coun-
tries, but it is more than a necessity in Australia,
it is essential to our existence.” He advocated the
establishment of an aeroplane service for carrying
mails, AND PROPHESIED THAT THE BRENNAN MONO-
RAIL WOULD BE THE RAILWAY OP THE FUTURE IN
Australia. As the old, slow steam locomotive was
responsible for the enormously overgrown cities of
the seaboard of Australia, so the high-speed mono
railway would break up the congested population of
the cities, and spread them over the more distant
and unsettled parts and create a revolutionary power
for the settlement of the so-called desert lands.
Australia has before it some of the biggest
railway construction jobs in the world. It
has to build its southern railway from east
to west; its northern railway from east to
west ( i.e from North Queensland to
Northern Westralia) ; and the north and south
railway down the middle of the continent.
Also, innumerable branches will be required
to feed these main Federal lines. Then the
Commonwealth has before it the stupendous
responsibility of changing thousands of miles
of existing lines to a uniform gauge. If
it makes a blunder, and does this work ,on
an antiquated pattern, so that the roads
will only be finished in time to start for the
scrap-heap, it may easily throw away
£50,000,000 or £100,000,000 of good Aus-
tralian money; Therefore, seeing .that there
is the strongest' possible reason to suspect
that a new invention is on the market—-
Brennan’s mono-rail, to wit—which will
consign all the existing lines to the scrap-
heap above-mentioned, one would fancy that
the most stodgy of Governments would take
an earnest look at it —or at least tell George
Retd to wake uo and abandon his bag of
confectionery and look at it—before plung-
ing into vast labors according to the old paths.
It is claimed for the mono-rail device that it
can tackle steep grades and narrow curves
that no two-rail locomotive can look at, and
that it can produce, with safety, at least
twice the velocity of the ancient biped con-
traption. These claims rest on actual trials
made in the presence of experts, and if the
trials were unfortunately made on a very
small scale that was merely because no Gov-
ernment had sense enough to put up the
money for a really big attempt. Countries
like England and France, which have their
railway systems practically finished, and are
doing very little new work, can afford to
lie low and wait till someone else proves
or_ disproves the advantages of the mono-
rail. They lose very little by waiting, and
they avoid responsibility. But Australia,
between its new constructions and its neces-
sary reconstructions, is almost starting
afresh, and if it starts on wrong principles
simply for want of a little reasonable in-
vestigation, there will be no gallows high
enough for the men who are responsible,
supposing it were possible to serve them out
poetic justice. Among all the questions now
before the Federal electors there isn’t one
half so important as this one. Yet, curi-
ously enough, this question doesn’t seem to
be before the Federal electors at all. In
fact, it looks as if all the bullock-teams in
Australia would be insufficient to drag
Andrew Fisher and co. to even a casual
and cursory consideration of it.

The Lesson of Hunger Striking.
“0.K.” writes : English suffragettes, claim-
ing equal political rights with men, are apt
to squeal when the rights are not the sort
they want. For instance, they squealed so
shrilly against forcible feeding in prison that
the nourishment is no longer compulsory.
Even their higli-priestess, Pankiiurst, was
allowed to starve herself into a temporary
release from gaol the other week. But a
male conspirator with the suffragettes
(Hugh Franklin), who tried the hunger
strike dodge when he was sent to quod for
nine months for setting fire to a railway car-
riage, had to suffer the alleged pangs of for-
cible feeding three times a week—ll 4 times
in all. He didn’t get equal political conces-
sions with the women. Nor did they squeal
loudly on his account. To have asked for
equality of the sexes in Franklin’s case
would have been to confess themselves privi-
leged offenders against man-made laws. So
they were content to let the male champion
of Woman’s cause be treated as a mere
male. The hunger strike device, being essen-
tially feminine in conception, has brought
the “weaker” sex into violent collision with
suffragette doctrine. Mrs. Pankhurst would
stand on an equal footing with tyrant man
as a law-maker, but not as a law-breaker.
She has already taken advantage in prison
of her downtrodden condition, to do what
no man is permitted to do, and in so doing
she has given the cue for an all-round asser-
tion of sex privilege, which will be equally
embarrassing to her friends and her oppo-
nents. The possibilities of the hunger-strike
policy seem bound to appeal to every intelli-
gent woman who is in gaol for any cause
whatever. Why should the embezzling lady
clerk endure the awful monotony of two
years’ hard labor (that is, when lady clerks
begin to be equally prosecuted with mere
male clerks for the same sort of dis-
honesty, and equally sentenced by the
mere male Judge) if she can get out of gaol,
under surveillance, through refusing to take
the nourishment which only men prisoners
are compelled to absorb if they go on hunger-
strike? Why should a lady arrested on
suspicion of murder ever be satisfactorily
tried if she can hunger-strike with impunity,
because her sex is nrivileged? The tactics
of the suffragettes have reminded the Law
of how much latitude it allows, and will be
likely always to allow to women unless they
deliberately kill the goose-like sentiment
which lays the golden concessions. The
hunger-strike is the test of man’s inhumanity
to Sissie, compared with his inhumanity to
Jim. If a woman were allowed to starve her-
self to death in gaol, the public outcry would
be 10 times more absurdly emotional than
even the successful protest against forcible
feeding. On the other hand, a man might be
permitted to starve himself to death or die
of compulsory feeding, and the nublic would
reckon him well out of the world for his
accursed foolishness. What were brutality
to the woman would be “just what the man
deserved.” Man insists upon granting in-
equality to the other sex; the Law allows
it, and Mrs. Pankhurst, whilst doing her
best to put a stop to it, is evidently deter-
mined to see that she gets it.

The Finest Coastal Marine in the
World.
The Australian coastal steamship trade has
been flourishing fine balance-sheets for
several years now, and some of the latest
inter-State liners are fit to berth alongside
the best oversea vessels that lumber up Cir-
cular Quay. The Canberra, a towering
8000-tonner, came into port the other morn-
ing, and added itself to (he fleets that include
the Indarra (10,000 tons), Warilda (8000
tons), Wandilla (8000 tons), Karoola (7000
tons), and other new and impressive sea
mansions. There would be more occasion
for the usual speeches and champagne if, in-
stead of merely wandering in from the ocean,
these expensive ships slid into the water
from a Sydney or Melbourne slip. There is
no particular reason why they should not be
made on the national premises; the Austra-
lian has everything needful but an effective
duty; but that is sufficient to stop him, and,
while he is waiting for the Fisher Govern-
ment to attend to its job and provide him
with adequate Protection, whole squadrons
of foreign-built steamers are being added to
the mercantile fleets, and the chance of a
prosperous period is fading over the horizon.
The lunatic provision whereby all new ships
exceeding 500 tons, burden are duty free
does not even give local shipbuilding firms
a chance to bid for the shallow draught boats
that hurry up and down between the big
ports and the bar harbors. The naval archi-
tects have discovered, of recent years, how,
to build quite large • boats that will draw
only a few feet and still refrain from stag-
gering unduly. (Occasionally they forget
themselves and give passengers the shock of
their lives ; still, as a rule, they are well be-
haved.) These ingenious sea-balancing
machines steam contemptuously past the
pottering Federal duty, and the local man
has to try and keep going on an occasional
dredge or mud-punt order, and any repair
jobs that happen along. For very shame’s
sake, the Commonwealth should make haste
and give the shipbuilding industry a shove
ahead. From an economic point of view,
an island continent that is not capable
of making its own ocean-going steamers is
several miles behind any community of South
Sea head hunters. No one ever heard of a
head hunter importing canoes from London.

“If I were compelled,” said Joseph Cook,
leader of the Opposition in the Australian
Parliament, and chronic applicant for the
Prime Minister’s job (N. 8., no one that this
paper knows of desires to compel Joseph
Cook) —“if I were compelled” (this paper
here resumes Cook’s story after a lengthy
parenthesis) “to write a recipe for the reduc-
tion of the present high cost of living in
Australia over and above the increase com-
mon to the world, I should say, ‘The restora-
tion of honest economical and efficient gov-
ernment throughout Australia.’ ” The plati-
tude is so beautiful that there is an adjourn-
ment just here for applause. But,
after all, what does Joseph Cook mean by
economical government? For instance, a
healthy, upstanding Bulgarian legislator,
sound in wind and limb, and capable of just
as much _ incivility to the Speaker as any
other legislator, can be hired for 12s. a day,
and even that payment only lasts while the
one-House legislature at Sofia is sitting.
How is that for economical government?
And judging by the way the Bulgarian has
lately knocked seven devils and some saucer-
pans out of the Unspeakable Turk, the Gov-
ernment can’t be wholly inefficient.
[James Edmond, The Bulletin Office, Sydney.]
Apropos of the present anti-Defence clamor :
Again arises the moral —Be Prepared. In the
scrap which shook up south-eastern Europe the
Turks, with more than twice the population of the
Confederates to draw upon, hardly won a single skir-
mish, and the description of the 80,000 antiquated
scrap-iron rifles which the Bulgarians took from
them accounts for a great deal of this misfortune.
On the other hand, among the Confederates the only
Confed. that didn’t score a single really valuable suc-
cess was Montenegro. The Montenegrins certainly took
Skutari, which is a town of about 32,000 population,
and so completely dominated by hills that first-class
modern artillery should bump it out inside three
days, but it appears now that the place was sold to
them in return for their promise of assistance in
making the scoundrel in charge, Essad Pasha, King
of Albania. That leaves Montenegro with a very big
responsibility in return for a very small town, re-
garding which the Austrians have already served
notice to qyit. Even what little effect was produced
on Skutari by the besiegers was apparently, in the
main, the work of some well-trained Servian artil-
lery lent for the occasion. The Montenegrin has
always been regarded as about the best fighter
in Europe, but he is a fighter of the howl-and-rush
variety, like the McGregors and Macphersons of
the old Scottish clans, and though howl-and-rush
tactics, combined with a magnificent capacity for
lurking behind a boulder on a perpendicular hill-
side, have done great things in the defence of the
Black Mountain, they were of little value in attack
against even the crumbling walls of Skutari. On
the other hand, the Turk also used to have the repu-
tation of being about the best fighter going, and in
the days when he swept over Northern Africa, and
annexed Hungary, and pounded at the gates of
Vienna, and helped himself to Southern Russia, and
scared the Pope in Rome, he had some claim to the
honor. But though he was a great pounder and wal-
loper of the mediaeval type, and did tremendous
things in an age when everybody pounded personally
and walloped by hand, he didn’t keep up with the
scientific procession of more recent years. He fell
behind and became a back number, till a time came
when his. fez was imported from Austria. Even
with numbers and strong fortifications in his favor
his old Brown Bess armament gave away the Otto-
man show, and the Servian and the Greek and the
magnificently-trained Bulgarian climbed all over his
turban and his carcase. As already mentioned, the
one good show he put up was against the leaping
Montenegrin who was worse-trained than himself.
Montenegro left the best of its manhood dead outside
Skutari, and had to cry for help to its nearest
ally, and it finally secured the one fortified town
that stands to its credit by entering into large obli-
gations on behalf of the Turkish commander, who
promptly went forth and set up in business as a
fresh new monarch. And now that Montenegro has
been ordered to leave' its scrap of plunder all its
sacrifices are practically in vain. Even Austria
hardly cares to serve notice to quit on Bulgaria and
Greece, but Montenegro, with its gallant and pictur-
esque comic opera army, gets no consideration worth
mentioning.
[James Edmond, The Bulletin Office, Sydney.]
C. G. Wade, talking at Wagga (N.S.W.)
on the alleged failure of the Labor Govern-
ment’s land taxation, said that three years
ago the Laborites guaranteed cheap land
and plenty of it, whereas land was actually
now no cheaper than it was in 1910. Wade
shouldn’t go to the Riverina to air his half-
baked ideas about land. As a matter of fact,
values there had been climbing up steadily
for years, and it is only during the last 18
months or so that they have been steadied.
Moreover, in spite of the Federal land tax,
they would probably have gone on mounting
higher and higher and making the struggle
of the farmer harder and harder if the State
Government hadn’t dropped Wade’s own
mad scheme of settling people on the land.
The more vigorously Wade pursued his
policy—in other words, the harder he pur-
sued the big landholders to buy them out
with borrowed money—the higher the price
of land went: and not merely the land Wade
bought, but the land everybody else bought.
The graduated land tax may not have done
everything that a land tax ought to do; but,
anyway, it put the fear of God into the
heart of the big, loafing landlord. The Wade
policy merely put the glint of hope into the
big. loafing landlord’s eye.
[S. H. Prior, The Bulletin Office, Sydney.]
Thus The Bulletin’s Old Soldier:—
The English Peace Society has got hold of the
Manchester Guardian, and induced it to circulate
quite a remarkable little story, calculated to make
everybody outside the Society of Friends roar with
laughter. I tear off a fragment:—
“Despite the agreement of 1911, foreign Gov-
ernments will not accord Australian war vessels
cither the peace or war privileges allowed regular
light’ng ships, unless they are part of an Imperial
fleet.”
We are not at -war just yet, so we may ask what are
“peace privileges” ? A ship of war entering a foreign
port is entitled to have its flag saluted. It is also
exempt from the jurisdiction of the local police and
magistrates, but it .cannot send armed parties on
shore for any purpose without getting leave from the
local authorities. In war-time it' hasn’t any special
privileges if it is a belligerent. A merchant ship
can stay in a neutral port till doomsday, but a war-
ship must either leave in 24 hours or submit to be
disarmed and dismantled. The Guardian appar-
ently doesn’t know that the Australian fleet has
quite a number of precedents behind it. Egypt,
Greece and Bulgaria had recognised naval forces
when they were still Turkish dependencies. India
has a sort of navy of its own. Canada is doing some
The Warning.

Should the Referendum indorse the annexation of
trade and Commerce proposed by the Caucus, we shall
place under the Federal Government, among: other
matters too numerous to catalogue, all the sales of
all our butchers, bakers, grocers, drapers, millers,
auctioneers, pedlars, hawkers, chemists, druggists,
etc. ; and all business dealings in milk, dairy pro-

Now, if you vote “Yes,”
Says the Fusionist press,
In a voice which is terribly raucous ;
What you drink and you eat,
Such as bread, milk and meat,
Will be wholly controlled by the Caucus.
Yes, the Caucus
Will step in and seize
Pickles, butter and cheese,
Tea, currants and coffee and ices,
And vend them around,
By the quart or the pound,
At tyrannical Government prices.
The trade in your foods
And your drapery goods,
Which you proudly display to your neighbor,
Will be rudely annext
On the lightest pretext
By the hot-headed Party of Labor —
Yes, of Labor.
Your carpets and mats
And remarkable hats
(Oh, say, are you listening, ladies?)
Will be branded L.P.,
And it’s easy to see
That the country will hurry to Hades.
And though you vote “No,”
Still the country will go
To the Deuce all the same, but more slowly,
If Labor be sent
To resume Government
And continue its tactics unholy ;
Most unholy.
One must hopefully look
For the triumph of Cook
(Oft described as a crude and a raw cuss)
Who is leading the band
That would rescue the land
From the murderous clutch of the Caucus.

thing in the same line. Scotland had its own ships
after its king became also King of England and Ire-
land. And Australia has owned war vessels for so
many years that it seems rather late in the day to
raise the question of their status. In any case, pro-
vided a fleet can fight, why worry about its status.
The Hague Peace Conference might possibly dis-
qualify the British fleet, but while the British fleet
is able to shoot like the Devil, it wouldn’t matter
much.
The prosecution of a 17-year-old boy at Mel-
bourne City Court, last week, threw another
sidelight on the base uses to which the
assisted immigrant system is sometimes
turned. The accused came from Cornwall
two months ago. His father, a mine mana-
ger, had supplied him with a little money,
and this he “lost” on the voyage out. Pos-
sibly he went “no trumps” with three weak
suits in his hand. Being an unhealthy im-
migrant and a moral weakling he took to
“pinching” neglected bicycles from the kerb,
and sold five of them for the miserable sum
of £3 ss. He desired to go back to dear old
England. A lady immigrant, who mothered
this valueless specimen of population on the
voyage and after his landing, stated that she
had written to his parents to send out his
return passage-money, and meanwhile she
would undertake to look after him. So the
boy was released as a first offender. If his
passage money is forthcoming his Australian
career will come to an inglorious end next
month. In the hearing of the case nothing
transpired as to how this hopeless immi-
grant “well educated and just from college,”
had come to be passed by the Victorian State
agent in England as a qualified agricultur-
ist, or why he had not been placed on his
arrival with one of the farmers who are said
to be crying out for labor. Apparently he
had never thought of getting away from
Melbourne city or of taking un any industry
save the “pinching” of bikes from the road-
side.
The Melbourne Age is in a tangle over
the election for Denison (Tas.). It won’t
support Laird Smith (Labor) at anv price,
and the Fusion candidate, whom, by the
way, it calls “W. H. Trenth,” is that old,
reliable Protectionist, but backsliddery
Laborite, W. A. Trenwith, whom nine years
ago it derided and threw clods at till further
orders. Certainly there is an Independent
candidate that it might support in
Alicia O’Shea Petersen. But her chances
are as Buckley’s, and the Age loves to be on
the winning side. So it will probablv sup-
port the hated Trenwith—in a cold, ex-
hausted sort of way.
[F. C. Jones, Elgar-road, Burwood, Victoria.]
Concerning one of Australia’s three women
candidates: —
Hobart, of all places, has a lady candidate; she is
contesting the Denison seat in the House of Reps.,
and her name is Alicia O’Shea Petersen. A buxom
matron, she has a deal of originality, and a large
assortment of political common sense, with streaks
in it. Wearing a stylish opera cloak, she came on
to the Town Hall platform without a chairman or
supporter, and with the confidence of a bookmaker
took complete charge of the meeting. She wants
to abolish the Address in Reply, Legislative Councils,
and silver trowels and spades at the opening of pub-
lic buildings and railways. She also proposes to
put her foot down on compulsory defence training
of youths. In between getting hoarse, she got out-
side a mug of what looked like water; raising her
g’ass, she exclaimed, “Here’s to my election!” Near
the end of her address, a youth impressed with her
chances of a Parliamentary income of £ 600, publicly
inquired, “How about seeing you after the show?”
Her chances are not as rosy as her cheeks.

“Baron Bowyangs”: The N.S.W. Labor
Government appeared the other day at Syd-
ney Water Police Court as landlard. It
prosecuted a withered dame. 80 years of age
for rent dues which had fallen into arrears,
or, in the event of failure to pay,
demanded possession of one of its
beautiful and palatial humpies on the
Rocks Resumed Area. The aged party <
stated that she had resided on the
property for 57 years, 37 of them in her
present house. The magistrate opined that
if she didn’t pay up what she owed for rent
she would reside on the old hallowed snot
for no longer than another month. It was a
risky prosecution to take on. “The dying
rockchopner” would be an insignificant
heart-bleeder; in the throes of the adjacent
election as compared to a poor old mother
of 80 cast upon the streets like a homeless
dog to die (loud sobs) by the order of a
brutal Government (hoots!).
One surprise of the Federal nominations
was the uprising of Miss Mulcahy against
little Dr. Maloney, for Melbourne. “Baby”
Kirton, erst of Ballarat, had started a ten-
tative, trifling sort of campaign against
Maloney, who thought so little of it that he
hadn’t bothered to hold a meeting. But Kir-
ton rushed in with his nomination two
minutes too late, so “Liberalism” and the
W omen’s National League are not officially
represented in the contest for the district of
the temporary Federal capital. The Liberal
banner, therefore, falls into the lady’s_hands
by default. Miss Mulcahy, by the way, was
organising for Labor for the past few years,
and puts her conversion down to the party’s
delay in granting effective Protection, the
abolition of the postal vote and other mat-
ters. The “little doctor” will now have to
hustle, but not very strenuously.

Probably it was a place like Sydney that
the Evangelist, in “The Pilgrim’s Progress,”
had in mind when he described the town of
Vanity:—
There were at all times to be seen jugglings,
cheats, games, plays, fools, apes, knaves and rogues, -
and that of every kind.
This writer reckons he could place every-
thing mentioned excepting the particular
plays that led the bald and antiquated pro-
phet to class them in such company. Any-
how, as they could not have included a
simple and joyous comedy like “On Our
Selection,” at the Palace, he (the under-
signed scribe) has no hesitation in com-
mending that show to the holy children of
the city. The jugglers, cheats, fools, knaves
and rogues will be so busy on the Referenda
that the holy children may come out of their
caves with impunity and biled shirts.

This critic has nothing further to state,
in reference to that badly built but highly
popular American comedy, “The _ Fortune
Hunter,” except to reiterate that it is still
badly built and still highly popular at the
Criterion.
The Alhambra (Sydney), under the old

has decided to swear off moving pictures
and nail its prospects to the burnt cork of
the corner-man and the joy song of the

fragment of faith pinned to the young thing
that flutters in pink fleshings ; but not suffi-
cient to make bald stall-holders cease
mourning for the rude old days. The first
trial of the experiment was given on Satur-
day before an expansive audience, and unless
the fervor of its applause was a mere com-
pliment to the management, or a cover for
muttered curses, the programme was satis-
factory. The Bulletin reckons it was a
tidy little show, and one that would not be
spoilt by encouragement.

“Fanny’s First Play”—which is very obvi-
ously Shaw’s latest play—was staged at the
Little Theatre, Sydney, on Monday night.
It teems with humor and observation and
bizarre viewpoints; the characterisation is
masterly; and the situations are wildly
amusing. Yet it didn’t earn half the
laughter and applause which its rare
merits deserve. The explanation seems to
this writer to be that it isn’t one of
those plays which transplant well. It is, in
the highest degree, racy of the London soil.
In fact, it is racy of an infinitesimally small
part of London. It would make little anpeal
probably, except as a roaring farce, to Hamp-
stead or Fulham, much less to Poplar or
Islington. On the other hand, to a certain
type of West Ender it would be a thing of
pure delight. All the necessary conditions
ar* supplied by the astute playwright. The
Middle Classes are scarified throughout, with
a sort of aloof benignity, suggestive of the
humorously tolerant spirit in which the
Squire rebukes one of his tenants for a bout,
of drunkenness. The brother of a Duke is
shown in the guise of a footman. Nothing
thrills the West End more pleasurably than
the spectacle of a Duke’s relative in a menial
position. The noble fellow’s splendid self-
control, in face of the vulgarity of his em-
ployers, causes the audience to murmur
thoughtfully, “Ah ! blood will tell,” “Noblesse
Oblige,” and other comforting maxims of the
sort. The sensation which occurs when his
identity becomes known is a genteel equiva-
lent of the appearance of the Face at the
Window, or of the great railway smash in Act
IV. of “The Blood on the Tablecloth.” And
then there is the device inspired probably
by the arrival of the rdvue in England, of
introducing real critics. The critics and
their views are old friends —to London ; that
is to say, to the section of London which
belongs to the Garrick, and reads the Satur-
day Review, and buys Max Beerbohm’s
caricatures, and is seen at every important
first night. To us they are total strangers.
The Little Theatre management made an
effort to introduce local color in this connec-
tion, by having the four critics made up to
resemble Sydney journalists. But it didn’t
bring the characters any nearer to the audi-
ence. Rather the contrary. Trotter, for
example, who displayed the gloriously egg-
like dome or cupola of the man Bedford,
voiced sentiments which Randolph would
burst rather than hold. And so it was with
the others.
* * * *
The plot of the play, which Fanny’s doting
father induces real actors to act, and real
critics to criticise, in an English country
house, concerns the misfortunes of a couple
of shop-keeping families. Younsr Mr. Gilbey
has gone on the loose, and received a sen-
tence of 14 days’ imprisonment for being
drunk and disorderly, at the same time as
Miss Knox (to whom he is engaged) has been
gaoled for wantonly assaulting _ the police.
Gilbey’s revel has been enjoyed in the com-
pany of a preposterously genial young woman
named Delaney. Miss Knox has penetrated
to the lounge of the Empire alone; been ac-
costed there by a strange Frenchman ; gone
on to a night club; and been arrested dur-
ing the subsequent raid on the establish-
ment. Anyone who knows Shaw will under-
stand the delicious sidelights that are thrown
on everybody as the outcome of these com-
plications. There is a family argument
between the Gilbey and Knox parents —one
of those immemorial old domestic controver-
sies -which begin nowhere and progress from
one idiotic inconsequence to another, till
all hands are half frantic —that is worth the
entrance money by itself. Everybody does
and says the most unusual things in the
most natural possible manner. Presently
we become so infected by the author’s spirit
that, when one of the characters acts reason-
ably (when, for instance, the anguished
Knox inquires as to the “intentions” of the
foreigner who has compromised bis daughter)
we are convulsed. In the epd Juggins mar-
ries Miss Knox; young Gilbey is affianced
to the astounding Miss Delaney, whom his
mother has taken to at sight; the Frenchman
delivers a panegyric on the land where such
things are possible, and all ends dementedly.
* * * *
A notable play—the best joke of the year,
so to speak—and the acting of it is aston-
ishly good. Alfred Bristowe provides, in
Duvallet, a brilliant sketch of a genuine
Frenchman —one of the hardest things to
discover on the English-speaking stage.
Kenneth Brampton (Bobby Gilbey) is excel-
lent as a Cockney youth of raffish habits.
Miss Violet Paget (Margaret Knox) is to
the life the strenuous, vehement female whom
Shaw conceives as tracking down defence-
less man with a view to marriage. Miss
Shirley Huxley has a trying role to handle
as Dora Delaney, and she overplays it here
and there, notably when the maddened
Gilbey dashes from her presence in uncon-
trollable fury. Her wide and affable grin
should surely fade, if only momentarily,
before the aged man’s despair. G. Kay
Souper, Reynolds Denniston, and Hugh
Buckler are good in more or less straight
parts. The parents are excellently repre-
sented, and so are the critics, a couple of
them being triumphs in the art of make-up.
Take it for all in all, this is a play which
everyone should see once, and which some
will see half a dozen times.

Despite the special attractions at the rival
comic show round the corner (the Tele-
graph), including Sporting Charlie Wade,
the Mount Kembla slide-for-life expert, and
Jo Carruthers, the bounding wire-netting
lifter, the National Amphitheatre (Sydney)
is offering quite as much genuine amuse-
ment as could be expected. There is plenty
of farce, make-believe, rag-time, and so on.
The star turns are provided by the four
Avolos, xylophonists, the seven Mangeans,
acrobats, and a team of monkeys under Carl
Prinz. Anyone who wants more entertain-
ment for the money than can be obtained at
the National is urged to go into Federal poli-
tics.

As an example of mathematical accuracy
“The Cowboy and the Squaw,” at the Adel-
phi, is almost unequalled on the Sydney
stage. Time after time an error of one
second would put the co. to the trouble and
expense of finding a new hero and heroine,
also a catalogue of sub-heroes and heroines ;
but the alarm installation for whistling up
the faithful Indians works so admirably that
to date George Marlow hasn’t been faced
with an undertaker’s bill. Other than that
the only things worth mentioning are the ride
after the steer whereon the hero is bound,
the now almost-common racing machine being
brought successfully into action, and the
scenery, which, being mostly mountains and
snow lends itself readily to artistic effects
What isn t mountains and snow isn’t- ok
the average. The cahuuMriS “elUan'

greasy, unwashed cowboy with shootin’ iW
always handy and the hero is no longer poor
but honest—he is a champion broncho bus
ter, also handy with explosives, and is on ™
even better financial footing than the villain
And the real heroine creates a precedent hv
dying in the last act. George Cross, the
much-rescued hero, makes a fine-looking cow
boy, but gives the impression that he would
like it better if they could make it a tram
instead of a horse next time. T. W Llovd
is villainous enough to satisfy the most ex
acting galleryite; Nellie Fergusson is a city
girl, Ethel Buckley a prairie waif, and Nellie
Bramley the Indian maid who is shot in the
last act. All do their fair share, and do it
well.

Sydney appears to be tlie Mecca of trained
animals. Within the past few months chim-
panzees, bears, horses, dogs, nigger pugilists
and educated pigs have made pilgrimages
this way, and now a troupe of trained seals
has put in an appearance at the Tivoli.
There are seven of them altogether, though
two do the bulk of the work, and their reper-
toire consists of balancing various articles of
furniture on their snouts, and then either
rolling over, climbing steps or walking the
tight rope. A seal band, the drum being
most in evidence, provides the noise. The
Clarence Sisters and Brother’s quick-change
act isn’t likely to be the cause of any riotous
outbursts; and Sydney Bach, the monologue
entertainer, is having a second time on
Mclntosh’s bit of the earth. O’Hana San,
Cummin and Sealiam (last nights), Osborn
and Brookes and the De Bruns are the re-
maining leading lights. Next week Marini,
the warbler, and the Patti Franks will make
their re-appearance.

The author of the above (viz., John B.
Wowser, the Blue Ruin Coffee Palace, Syd-
ney, who hereby signs in the presence of
three witnesses and a dog, lest he should
unwittingly infringe the Act) had progressed
thus far when he was driven to desist for
lack of further rhymes. Enough has been
sung, however, to indicate to the world that
the show at Her Majesty’s, Sydney, is still
with us, and going strong.
A few words from “10-2-4,” who occasion-
ally does theatrical notices for this paper:—
Talking of Trusts (everyone seerns to be doing it
nowadays, curse them), the one thing that is com-
mon to the entire tribe from Idaho (U.S.A.) to
Peebles (N. 8.) and further, is impatience under
criticism and furv in the face of opposition. Take
the J.C.W. Theatrical Trust in Australia. It has
actually started a paper of its own. Anyhow, the
Theatre is largely run by one of the young men
in the Trust’s employ in the sense that he holds
shares in it and writes editorials, and so forth for it.
Part of it consists of slavish adulation of those m
the employ of the Firm, part of acid assaults on thf
performers at rival shows. F'rinstauee, on this
month’s issue we find such highly edifying shafts as
the following:—
“What is Madge Temple [of the Tivoli] engaged
for—to sing songs or wear dresses?
The Lord Mayor mentioned at a banquet that no-

of an indelicate nature. Then Madge Temple en-

ihat the idea is detrimental to all canons of art,
there can be no shadow of a doubt. To begin with,
it is vulgar, and vulgarity, by nature of its very
hideousness, has nothing whatever to do with art
in any form.... A golden opportunity to that abom-
mable pest, ‘the stage-door Johnnie.’.... [moans
from the scandalised chorus ladies] to be
hoped that before long the management will have
discovered a less glaringly vulgar mode,” etc., etc.
The Bulletin is, admittedly, about the only Aus-
tralian paper which leaps decisively on the Trust’s
shows from time to time. Of course, the Trust’s
loyal young servant is maddened. Hear him:—
“The Bulletin substitutes the humorist for the
critic. Nobody takes the comments of this weekly
on the theatre as anything beyond mere light read-
ing. .. .Efforts based on imperfect observation
Trivial... .provide the critic with a pair of strong
opera-glasses. .. .piffling depths,” etc., etc.
The foaming writer next proceeds to rend The
Bulletin’s literary style.
“In a notice of ‘The Belle of New York,’ it is re-
marked that Mr. Leslie Holland’s performance lacked
‘unction.’ ‘Extreme unction,’ probably. If the critic
meant unctuousness,’’ etc., etc.
The critic meant unction. He also meant unctuous-
ness. Webster, who is good enough for him, defines
“unction” as, amongst other things, “a simulated
or fictitious fervor, or emotional gush, unctuous-
ness.” The above trifle is only interesting as indi-
cating that one with a considerable knowledge of
the theatre is liable to possess but an exiguous ac-
quaintance with the English language.
The really useful lesson to be gained from the
whole outburst is that a Trust, so soon as it achieves
a position of financial importance, more or less, con-
siders that it should be sacrosanct. It mustn’t be
criticised, or its young men will give the critics a
series of good, hard knocks ; and those who oppose it
in business must be firmly exposed for the immoral,
godless and vulgar outsiders that they are. A writer
never properly appreciates how low and debased and
intellectually deficient he is, nowadays, till he finds
himself yammering pitifully on the wrong side of a
Trust palisade.

Adelaide picture shows are wisely desert-
ing the old idea of giving merely a pleasant,
unrememberable evening. The scheme now
is to offer something the patron can talk
about. Wondergraph has a realistic,
gory bullfight, and a careful, regardless-
of-expense “Tempest,” chiefly remarkable
for the fact that it improves on
►Shakspeare by acting in detail all the
previous Italian plotting which he “took as
read.” West’s deals conscientiously with
Hugo’s “Miserables” —gloomy, but a master-
piece. To the King’s are coming some much-
heralded Japs. At the Tivoli is De Biere,
who gives even the experienced theatregoer
something new in the way of appearances
and vanishings. This turn lasts for a quite
unusual 50 minutes, though it doesn’t seem
half the time. “The Monk and the Woman”
have arrived, together, at the Royal. Yel-
low and Green don’t fight to any extent
worth mentioning in sensible South Aus., so
the piece has to struggle along without the
glorious ad. it got in more benighted cities
—this critic names no names. Other shows
have varied from a Knox organ recital and
a bulldog championship to an evening of
song, story and drama, all written by one
Rosenblum, a local author of whom more is
going to be heard. And Adelaide’s already
high musical reputation has a further lift
from Heinicke’s Orchestra, a brilliant band
of 60, which packed the Exhibition at its
opening performance on Saturday night.

The Bulletin’s Expert Bellowdammer —
a young man who will go miles to
see * a murder, and who possesses no
reverence for grey hair, whiskers, sofa
stuffing, or theatrical trusts —reports
briefly thati “Antony and Cleopatra,”
now at Sydney Royal, may be right enough
for Shakspeare Societies, but that it would
be a rank failure, if produced on honest
bellowdrama lines, under the title “Driving
a Fat Soldier to Destruction.” It is hardly
necessary to add that the flippant young
Bellowdammer has not yet seen his photo-
graph in the Theatre. Persons of his sort
seem to be carefully excluded from the
“faculty” of stage criticism, of which a well-
known Sydney daily paper man has been
elected “dean.” If the Bellowdammer learns
Proper Respect, the Theatre may one day
appoint him verger, or it may even ordain
him a probationary sub-curate. But his
chances of ultimately gaining high distinc-
tion are practically nil. He need never hope
to enter a crowded theatre on a first night,
arrayed in vestments and mitre, and carrying
his crozier and shield of anonymity, the lat-
ter decorated with his official coat-of-arms,
i.e., a nound of butter rampant in a field
azure.
Jean Valjean, Hugo’s lovely example of a
regenerated ruffian, once more held the col-
lective eye of West’s audiences in Melbourne
on Saturday. Jean has excited the tearful
commiseration of the crowd for some nights
past, and scraps of Bizet, Auber and Ros-
sini have accompanied the screening of his
woes apparently for the pleasure of those
who are not yet educated up to grieving to
rag-time tunes. “Confidence” was the name
of a good film supporting the “Miserables”
item, and there was also a story of a cove
who stopped a bank rush by flourishing a
few bags of bogus coin. This same item can
be found in 25 novels at least.

“The Speculators,” the new musical bur-
lesque at the Bijou, might be best described
as a contest between Plain Absurdity and
Common Sense, with the latter early retir-
ing flabbergasted from the fray. Hilarity
reigns at intervals in this concoction where-
in little has any rhyme or reason, and the
plot is so extremely thin that the wind blows
brown paper through its bones. The finale
of the first act consists solely of the long and
silent evolutions of 20 supernumerary sol-
dier ladies in a stockbroker’s office. The story
concerns the chase of some mysterious scrip,
and the hunt is conducted with most of the
principals close on the quarry and a tuneful
chorus whipping in. Song and patter inter-
rupt the pursuit, which is also occasionally
adjourned for the perpetration of some terp-
sichorean stunt by the. clever legs of Miss
Eugenie La Blanc. This little lady has jet-
tisoned the quaintness which made her an
eccentric golf caddy in “The Grafters,” and
she is now a more conventional male imper-
sonator with her active understandings as
her strongest suit. Miss Teddy Martin,
Miss Gertrude St. Clair and Carlton Chase
play their little parts without offence, and
Bert La Blanc and Frank Yack, as the con-
ventional Jew and Dutchman of ’Murkan
vaudeville, indulge in irresponsible business
in which the latter looks like an elephant
trying to be a Pierrot. Which remark is
the subtlest reference the writer can think
of to suggest the comedian’s art and ombong-
pong.
“Zigomar” found an asylum at Melbourne
Majestic last week. That detective story,
wherein Zig conceals a heavy safe in a sewer
what time Broquet, the ’tec’, goes blood-
hounding after the lost property, gave the
congregation all that is required in the way
of thrill. Two comedies called “Jealousy”
and “Boulter’s Niece” serve to raise the
spirits. of those who were depressed by the
narration of “Near to Earth.” This week
the Majestic is putting in motion “The
Mystery of the Corner House,” a murder
drama wherein Beer is shown as the cause
of many cadavers, and Rum paves the broad
road to the cemetery.

Many pounds’ worth of boiled shirt and
chiffon were present at Melbourne Princess’s
on Saturday when “A Woman of Impulse”
did a tearful but select moan. Lady Lang-
ford, whose shallow, spendthrift career might
be gleaned from the butt of her husband’s
cheque book, so adores her father that she
saves him from the consequences of theft,
and thereby enmeshes herself in a web of
intrigue wherein one Navourac plays the
polite evening-dress spider. Navourac is
hard to realise as a logical character. Ap-
parently he is a political adventurer with
the wandering look of a decadent poet. He
seems to have got the Langford female in
his power for motives that are as vague as
the proceedings are preposterous. Even after
long cogitation on the subject, this writer
isn’t at all clear whether Navourac requires
the fair charmer to annex the secrets of her
husband, a tame diplomatist, or else desires
to use her as a tool in helping to rid his
bleeding fatherland of a foreign despoiler.
What is painfully obvious, however, is that
he involves the lady in a mesh of falsehood
and conspiracy, culminating in an early
morning scene in his private rooms wherein
she explains her presence and incidentally
conceals her father’s wickedness by a bogus
confession re non-existent misbehavior with
her masterful friend. Thereupon the lard is
in the conflagration, which burns with a
blue flame until the disclosures of several,
including Navourac, relieve the situation and
restore confidence all round. Navourac fades
out of the story after that, and Lady Lang-
ford’s pa dogs himself to the grave by a
mixture of whisky, weak heart and inflam-
mation of the conscience. So it only re-
mains for Hen. Plimmer to embrace his wife
and forgive her for all her good intentions.
His playing of the Langford baronet is
bright and convincing. Miss Beatrice Day’s
artistic and delicately-touched picture of
Lady Langford has all the importance of an
Old Master, and Mrs. Brough nicely pre-
sents Mrs. Dudley as one with just sufficient
civilisation to be a lady and just sufficient
claws to be a cat. Miss Parkes, G. S.
Titheradge, Arthur Styan and Sydney Stir-
ling are right enough in their resnective
parts, while Navourac is H. R. Roberts
divested of his usual shining virtues. Roberts
is not always successful, especially in the
emotional passages, But allowing for the
patent artificiality of Mr. Navourac, his im-
personation is very passable indeed.
At Her Majesty’s, Melbourne, the last
nights of “The Count of Luxembourg” have
arrived with rather indecorous haste. On
Monday (12th) “The Cingalee” will have a
tarewell revival for four nights, and then
the theatre will pause to take breath before
the firm’s other musical co. comes along with
“The Sunshine Girl.” on the 17th.
“Faust” passes out of notice at the King’s
on Friday. Next night an Anderson Co., the
one wherein Cyril Mackay and Roy Red-
grave stand for virtue and otherwise, will
appear for the first Australian time in “Life’s
Shop Window.” Which play is adapted
from a story of the same name written by
one Victoria Cross, whose novels are gener-
ally understood to be more “nutty” than
righteous.
In place of De Biere, who departed the
programme last week, H. C. Clarke and M.
Dale Owen are appearing in a slop-made
duologue “sketch” at the Opera House.
Theirs is about the weakest effort in humor-
ous comedy and trimmings that Melbourne
has lately experienced. The lady still talks
like the gum-chewing waitress at the Battles-
burg Hotel, and Clarke is the same old
Blackie Daw, but without a Wallingford to
play up to. Cassie Walmer is back again.
Scott-Leslie offers a mild entertainment of
the drawing-room variety. Reynard bursts
into baritone song under highly pretentious
conditions., and Henri French continues to
be droll up to a point. Also, Madge Temple
sings of Billy and other matters in a style
which has unobtrusive art to recommend it
and a well-tailored personality to back it up.

At the Athenaeum Hall, where Joseph
McCabe is concluding a brilliant series of
science lectures, and crowded audiences are
viewing their evolution on a screen, the
demon of frivolity awaits his opportunity to
take the platform. Next Tuesday (13th)
“The Dandies” start a six weeks’ season.
Three or four years ago the Jesters had a
successful innings at the Athenaeum Hall.
The Dandies, being better known exponents
of the same sort of trifling, are expected to
top their predecessors’ score.
Clara. Butt, the coming event at the
Auditorium in Collins-street, casts her tall
shadow across the threshold of that long-
expected concert hall. The Auditorium
thus far stands revealed in all its pride of
up-to-date completeness to private view
only, but already the Taits’ box plan is open,
and on Saturday, the 17th, the first of the
Clara Butt concerts will start the new build-
ing on its business career.
“Man and Superman,” as played by Julius
Knight and Co., at Melbourne Royal, “knocks
spots” off the recent Repertory Theatre per-
formance of Bernard Shaw’s comedy in the
matter of staging. The scenery in the second
and third acts gives much more scope for
effective grouping and by-play. Apart from
the gain in picturesqueness, the acting, as a
rule, has more force of realism. The Malones,
son and father (Herbert Ford and Green-
away), the Mrs. Whitefield of Maggie Knight
and the incidental prim old spinster of
Emma Temple are strikingly presented,
whereas those characters merely outlined the
author’s creations in the amateur show, and
the Malone outlines in particular were crude.
One gets a fuller sense of Shaw’s humor and
satire from the present production, yet the
performance is hardly more entertaining
than when Gregan McMahon appeared as
the dominating centre figure in the narrow
Repertory circle. After all, “Man and
Superman” is mainly a one-man talk. The
philosophy of the verbose and incredibly
wall-eyed John Tanner, in which truth and
fiction race neck and neck, seems the pre-
vailing purpose of the play. Now, Julius
Knight’s treatment of Tanner, irrespective
of the fact that he doesn’t quite look a pos-
sible former playmate of Irene Browne, lacks
the spirit of the central character. There is
nothing of the nervous, luxurious, egotistical,
theoretical Socialist about Julius.
If Gregan McMahon was too hard, dry,
spasmodic, aggressive and repellent, the pre-
sent Tanner errs further in the opposite
direction. Julius Knight’s manner is too
kindly, his tone has only a thin veneer of
brusqueness in places. He shapes too much
like an accepted humorist when he should
seem to take himself in dead earnest. In his
hoarse, throaty utterance of audaciously un-
conventional doctrines and bizarre sentiments
some of their pungency is lost. He will do
better when he is more familiar with his
lines, but he can never enunciate them as
cleanly and incisively as McMahon did.
Somewhere between the two widely con-
trasted impersonations the real Tanner of
G. B. Shaw would be found, and when found
he would not be a real piece of humanity,
anyhow. The Tanner of the book is flinty
in conversation and putty when pawed by
the feline Ann. Miss Browne’s Ann has
felinity enough, but her tricks are glaringly
apparent, her affectations of speech and pose
get on one’s nerves, and her make-un might
be intended for a seductive Lady Macbeth.
She has no color of fresh young vitality, but
her acting in the final scene is magnetic as
well as graceful. Having taken possession
of her man, her appealing manner of bid-
ding him resume his flow of monologue sug-
gests amorous womanly pride in his elo-
quence. Robert Whyte is a quietly natural
Ramsden; the Octavius and Violet Robin-
son of Martin Lewis and Mary Goulden are
pleasing in all respects. Leslie Victor is
rather too consciously Cockneyfied as ’Enry
Straker, the chauffeur, and of the people men-
tioned at the outset of this sermon Maggie
Knight is conspicuously convincing. “Man
and Superman” is for 12 nights only.
“Maestro”: Freddie Shipinan, of America, is pre-
senting to Sydney, on tile 3)st inst., about the most
sensational baritone in the world, David Bis mam is
his name, and he is a weird cross between a very great
artist and an expert revivalist, in uttwetn n.s bon*s
he is liable to chat to the audience like an old
friend ; explain why he doesn’t go off and be dragged
back with seeming reluctance to supply an encore;
and in general gives the tricks of his trade entirely
away. In certain grand operatic roles (f’rinstance,
Vanderdecken in “The Hying Dutchman”) he is the
world’s admitted best (the compositor made it
“beast” at first). He sings always in English. One
of his aphorisms is to the effect that opera audiences
don’t really object to English, only to bad English.
His most famous number is “Danny Deever” (lvip-
ling-Damrosch). “Danny Deever” is to Bispham what
“Home, Sweet Home” is to Patti; what the “Laugh-
ing: Song” is to Dolores, what “The Blind Boy” is to
Chirgwin. Owing indirectly to this song, Bispham
has the death of a fellow mortal on his soul. Frantic
with disappointment at the great man’s refusal to
sing “Deever” for the third time, a highly-cultivated
Boston lady swallowed her false teeth, and passed
over shortly afterwards in intolerable anguish.
The recent fracas on the stage of Melbourne Opera
House between conjurer De Biere and a citizen who
wanted to tie his thumbs so that he couldn’t get
them apart, was the inevitable result of De Biere’s
advertising challenge to all and sundry. A conjurer
who announces his willingness to forfeit £5O to a
hospital if anybody can so tie his thumbs together
as to prevent him from passing a hoop between them,
is simply looking for trouble. He may bluff and
wriggle his way out of the difficulty when the aver-
age person comes along, but he can’t achieve the
impossible against a man who refuses to be bluffed.
It isn’t clear that the conjurer can ever do the hoop
trick satisfactorily if his thumbs are secured with
unfriendly twine —limp, but unstretchable. Cer-
tainly, he cannot do it if they are tightly held with
a bowline. But why demand the impossible? The
trick that De Biere performs so neatly and amaz-
ingly when he is working with his own string,
which, having wire in it, yields to pressure and re-
mains outstretched when one thumb has been slipped
out —is as ancient as all the tricks that every con-
jurer performs. It is known to have been worked
100 years ago. Possibly it is as old as the Pyra-
mids. Few conjurers can do it. Small knuckled
thumbs, as well as great dexterity, are essential to
the performance. A few weeks ago a young man
was giving a display of the same trick at Luna Park,
and his crude imitation of De Biere’# finished feat
merely showed the difference between the amateur
who knows how a thing is done, and the gifted
artist who does it to perfection. 'The ring-chain
trick is another of the same family. All conjurers
know about it. Only the most skilful attempt it in
public.
“The Iconoclast”: Shakspeare’s alleged birthday
was celebrated on April 23. The true anniversary
was not due until May 3. Why ? Because England,
being a Protestant country, would not adopt the
RC. Gregorian Calendar until it was compelled by
Nature herself to do so in 1752, when 11 days had
to be thrown bodily out of the year in order to get
the solar circuit into its true path, and put the
seasons back into their places. The Catholic
nations adopted the calendar in 1582. when 10 days
were dropped out for purposes of adjustment. The
Gregorian, or New Style, was adopted by Sweden in
1753. Germany and Switzerland had adopted it in
1700; but Russia (and Greek Church countries
generally) have not done so yet, so all foreign let-
ters sent thereto are headed with two dates—O.S.
and N.S. Shakspeare is said to have been born on
April 23, 1564, and to have died on April 23, 1616,
aged 52 years. But both dates were according to
Old Style. Cervantes died on April 23, 1616, aged
69 years; but Cervantes died in Catholic Spain,
which for 34 years had adopted the Gregorian Cal-
endar. So, instead of Shakspeare and Cervantes
dying on the same day, the former died 11 days
afterwards.
A Sydney critic objects to Lily Brayton’s red-
haired Cleopatra, on the grounds that “it is impos-
s’ble to suppose her other than a brunette.” Why? Per-
haps because Shakspeare, who certainly never saw her,
and in all probability never heard of the Lagidae,
speaks of the typical lover seeing Helen’s beauty
“in a brow of Egypt.” Being partly Greek, Cleopatra
would have been as liable to be red-haired as a woman
of the Jewish or any other normally darkish race. The
Greeks were fair-skinned, violet-eyed, and often
golden-haired people, like their kinsfolk the
Georgians, who have retained their old-t’me beauty
down to the present day. What more likely than
that one of the famous charmer’s red-haired forebears
handed down the rufous strain to her? Certainly her
conduct with Antony and others, and her subse-
quent uncompromising methods with the asp, arc
suggestive of the coloring that has always gone with
verve and pluck and the joie de vivre.
“Floater”: The Taits, who directed the Australian
tour of Margaret Cooper, the pianologist, are re-
gretting the indiscretions of that remarkable lady.
Margaret was never threatened with humility or
with that reticence which is the better part of diplo-
macy, so when an opportunity offered on her de-
parture from Australia she biew off some hot air
anent the present or ultimate degeneracy of the Aus-
tralian race. To a Westralian reporter she confided
that “the Australians hadn’t enough reverence for
their betters” [presumably the English], and that
“Australia needed a leaven of Engl’sh aristocracy to
elevate and otherwise improve ‘the colonials.’ ” Those
observations were naturally bad for Margaret’s busi-
ness, for the Very Best People of Perth and Fre-
mantle stayed away from her chatter-at-the-piano
with great persistence, and often left her frowning
dreadfully at a wilderness of chairs. Something
similar happened in South Africa. At Johannesburg
she openly poked borak at the local elite by solemnly
plaving them into their seats when they strolled in
late; while her husband, Ilumble-Crofts, added to the
general unpleasantness by remarking that a certain
Johannesburg clerk “was the first gentleman he had
met since he left England.” So the lady became
rather disliked, and people started asking. “Who is
this Margaret Cooper?” and things like that. And
to put it bluntly: Who is Margaret Cooper? Apart
from a certain vaudeville prestige, she is, socially
speaking, very small potatoes; while her hyphened
husband is the son of an obscure country parson and
has never, to the public knowledge, done anything
more strenuous than play the incendiary to innumer-
able cigarettes.

JUGHT TO BE KILLED.
The Test who insists on explaining everything
in a loud voice just because he’s happened
to see the show before.
The most astonished person in Melbourne
was Thomas Jones Chia when the Judge
sentenced him to five years “with hard” for
having tried to murder his former boss be-
fore he had found pluck to murder himself.
The wretched little Chinese cracker had
quite confidently hoped he would be at
once set at liberty to leave Australia with
the alleged intention of returning to China.
Which allegation would probably have been
as false as all his yarns about his wealth,
his royal rank, and his castle on the Lake
of Chung Loo Soo, seeing that the Chinese
penalty for trying to murder a Government
official is something with snick-a-snees and
boiling oil in it. Chia’s idea, no doubt,
was to inflict himself on one of his numerous
relatives who live outside of Chow jurisdic-
tion. The exact legal value of his little in-
discretion was beyond his understanding,
apparently. When the Judge told him that
he had been an artful bounder and a calcu-
lating criminal the amazed prisoner began
to look welly sick. Still he retained his
feet. The sentence was practically a knock-
out. Chia reeled up against his fate, and a
warder took him to. the cells below. The
Law hasn’t Buckley’s chance of getting any
hard labor out of the exploded firework. He
is not built that way. His is the tempera-
ment of a turtle dove in the physique of a
sardine. The governor of chokee will have
to permit Chia to sit by the kitchen fire and
tell fairy tales to the warders.
A f6w minutes’ education in “push” slang
was afforded a South Melbourne Bench re-
cently when a youth, accused of calling the
police “rotters,” explained that he was with
a mate who was “giving it tongue,” when
he saw “a couple of rozzers”—not “rotters”
•—coming along, and “gave him the office.”
His mate had had a few “tastes” in, and he
thought he might be “hooked up”—hence
the gentle warning. The Law professed
ignorance of the word “rozzers,” but the
youth assured it that “State school nippers
would answer in chorus if they were_ asked
what it meant.” But whence comes it, and
how and why?
The first chapter of the Book of the
Lamentations of Jones: —
It isn’t always, the lucky man who wins the Art
Union prize, though it is almost always the unlucky
one that is bitten by the clog. A motor-car was
the star feature of a recent Melbourne hospital
gamble, and it' was won by a Laoor union official.
He now regrets that he didn’t draw a blank. A
motor-car can’t be used on a worker’s wages. Even
though he never starts the engine going the garaging
stands him in a matter of 15s. per week. And then
there are “sundries”—thousands of them. The Mel-
bourne winner tried to sell his white elephant at an
alarming sacrifice. In vain. People used to call to
inspect it and insist on being taken for drives. They
would then coldly refuse to buy, and the unhappy
worker would pay out some more cash for petrol,
new tubes, tyres at £lO each, and so on.
It is an old car, and old cars are like
old clothes —of little use save to the owner.
At latest advices the owner was thinking of cutting
his losses by giving the car away. His position
resembles that of the lady who lately won, as prize
in a church bazaar, a block of land at Laverton —
which is an exploded township of the “boom” days,
out near Werribee. (The first owner had vainly had
it on sale for years at £2 the lot. In despair she
offered it to the church as a raflle prize.) The
lucky winner paid £2 2s. transfer fees, a small
accumulation of overdue rates, and sundry other
items, and then settled down to enjoy her property.
Later she decided to sell. That is as far as she
has ever got. She may get ss. for it some day, if she
is fortunate. Meanwhile the municipal rates have
to be paid; so the longer she keeps it the more
it costs her. She has made several efforts to give
it away as another church bazaar prize, but the
local, churches are shy of it —very shy. Does any-
body know a way of utterly annihilating real prop-
erty? If so, will he please write to Mrs. Smith,
13 Brown-street, Jonesville?

A most promising lawsuit lias been
strangled at its birth in Adelaide. The
powerful Canowie Pastoral Co. had an ex-
hibit rejected at the Show in March. After
a heated correspondence,
the co. took the Agricultural
Society into the Supreme
Court, calmly claiming both
the prize end a declaration
that “the finding or opinion
of the alleged committee of
experts” was “contrary to
the ordinary priniciples of
natural justice.” Symon
and Piper, K’s.C., were busy
arguing a merely technical
application to strike out
pleadings such as that just
quoted, when Judge Murray
took a hand. Did the society
make any imputation
against the honor of the co. ?
“None,” said Piper. Did the
co. make such against the
society? “None,” said Sy-
mon. Then, said the Judsre
(in carefully selected judi-
cial language, of course), go
outside and settle it. Ad-
journed sine die. The only
valuable item in the expensive proceedings
was the admission by .Josiah Symon-—re-
markable from a lawyer—that it is a
mistake to write letters when you are
angry. “Correspondence led to friction,”
he said. “It is quite marvellous, when
two men get together, how difficulties
disappear in five minutes.” if people with a
grievance remember that, lots of lawyers
will starve.
LITTLE BOURKE-STREET JOHNNIES.
Twice again in Melbourne inquiring
friends have been told that hospital oatients
were getting on well, whereas subsequent in-
vestigation proved them in fact to be dead.
The Melbourne Hospital told one man that
his wife was “very comfortable” when she
had been deceased a whole week. Smith to
Brown: “Hello, old man, what’s your
trouble? Why those tears?” Brown: “I’ve
just rung up the hospital. They tell me my
wife is doing splendidly.” Smith : “I’m aw-
fully sorry, dear boy; Can I do anything
for you in the way : of arranging for the
funeral ?”
Sharp Cry of Protest from “Jeames” :
1 notice that Mr. C. G. Wade, in the course of an
assault upon his enemy, .Holman, accused the latter
of “fraternising with the Dukes at tne Carlton Club,
London.” Also, the young gentleman who does the
political notes for The Telegkaph mentioned bit-
terly that the Associate-Premier of N.S.W. had been
publicly entertained at “the Carlton Club,” and he
inquired, inferentially, what Holman’s outraged con-
stituents intended to do about it. The place where
Holman really fed and orated was, of course, the
City Carlton; and that anyone, even a daily paper
journalist or a State politician, should mix the two
resorts up, is to a Londoner, and one who has waited
on the best people in his time, simply stupefying.
The City Carlton is what is known as a “pot house.”
Practically anyone who is solvent, who has contrived to
avoid gaol, and who has at his command the Tory
watchwords or gags Of the period (this year they are:
“Winston is a d —d outsider” and “the little Welsh
attorney is ruining England”) —anyone, I say, with
the above qualifications, can belong to the City Carl-
ton. It absolutely gleams with Jews during the
lunch-hour. Most of the other members are stock-
brokers, solicitors, company promoters and uncon-
victed robbers of other sorts. There is a small
leavening of titled guinea pigs, young men of well-
known families who have gone into the “City” to
sell it motor-cars or what-not, and Parliamentarians
with city interests. This helps to redeem the inten-
sely Hampstead Heathian appearance of the members’
list. But dukes are as scarce there as they are at
(say) the Junior Athenaeum, to which a butler of
my acquaintance has belonged for years; or the
Junior Constitutional, of which a tailor, who has
made many a livery for me, is one of the oldest
members.
A very different proposition, indeed, is the Carl-
ton. It is the Conservative Club of the Empire.
The ordinary citizen has to have his name down for
a matter of 20 years before he can so much as come
up for election. If he is at all well-known (which
is to say, if he has the usual number of enemies), or
if his sponsors have, since they put him up, grown
unpopular, or turned Radicals, or been hanged, or
anything like that, he will be blackballed. It is one
of the few remaining London clubs, membersliin of
which confers a certain amount of social distinction.
Ernest Terah Hooley offered £lO,OOO to the Union-
ist partv’s funds, chiefly on the understanding that
he would be elected to the Carlton if it was ac-
cepted. The man who made an offer of that sort in
reference to the City Carlton would be ripe for Col-
ney Hatch. And, finally, strangers aren’t entertained
at" the Carlton. The City Carlton stands on .much
the same plane really as the Royal Automobile Club,
which numbers about 21 Hebrews to the square foot,
and to which practically anyone can be immediately
elected by the simple device of donning a pair of
motor goggles and getting photographed in a taxi.
From a man in th'e business:—
One of the most difficult problems of the police
magistrate has been what to do with the wife-wal-
loper. Here are four instances: No. 1 was a beetle-
browed son-of-a-tough, who had knocked his pale,
anxiety-corroded wife out of shape with his hoof.
Sentence, two months without the option. A night
or two later the magistrate observed the woman
slowly beating up the pavement in a hopeless, hag-
gard way. The story was simple; there were young
children to be fed and warmed, and the magistrate’s
conscience revolted at the recoil of the punishment
he had decreed. No. 2 was before the same court,
and the evidence showed that this husband-animal
had brutally ill-used his wife (for no apparent
offence) in the presence of her four small children.
It was a fair thing to tear him off three months’
hard labor, but the magistrate recalled the wan face
of the woman in the street, and fined the bread-
winner in the cage £3, in default one month’s im-
prisonment. Next day the wife called on the har-
assed dispenser of .justice, and explained that the
money couldn’t be raised, and that the prospect in

SUDDENNESS.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
Picture plays can be a means of education... .1
can only protest against the really improper ones;
but as I have not been to either surf-bathing or pic-

matters. I am over from Maoriiand on a campaign
against the drink traffic, and feel this gigantic evil
is as much as I can take in hand this year.
-—The Modesty of Mrs. Lee-Cowie.
God made the world in one day short of seven,
And finished earth before He started Heaven.
Stars, planets, trees and rivers, stones and sticks
He made in evenings and in mornings six.
Since then the world has slowly, surely worked
To make complete the job that first was burked.
No more a week makes system from the mud.
It takes us thirteen weeks to grow a spud.
We make no constellations in a minute.
It takes the wheat three months to grow life in it
No more a system builds ’tween dark and dawn,
No more three shifts can trim a stellar lawn.
We go but softly that we may go far.
He fails who ties his waggon to a star;
We know our father had to hurt his foot
Before he found out how to make a boot.
We know that hunger gripped him in a vyce
Long years before he learned that chops were nice.
That he was worn by travel —tried by force
Ere need showed him how to break in a horse.
And that of sunburn all his skin was full
Before he robbed the first sheep of her wool.
And so he grew, full painfully, with time —
Lifting his weary head from out the slime.
And slowly learned, by pain and shame and slights,
To take command of all his appetites.
But Missus Lee —who knows not picture plays,
And hates joy as she hates the surfers’ ways—-
Has come to smash the evil grown of beer
And thinks ’twill be enough to do this year!
Oh, Missus Lee ! Ye shall not banish yet
The golden wine until my sun has set.
Beshrew me! Don’t abolish —there’s a dear,
Please don’t abolish alcohol this year!
Next year I may be dead and then you may
Kill the gigantic evil as you say.
But hasten slowly! Think how long it took
To write Blue Ruin’s secret in a book.
The savage tapping at a toddy palm
And gladly sampling the fermented balm !
The Primal Boozer with the First Fat Head—
The Primal He who went in boots to bed.
He who the first quart of the Bubbly supped
And was by the First Barman Piek-me-upped.
Consider all the years it took to make
Varieties of all things the thirst to slake !
The aeons in which students pale did win
By step and step from Lemonade to Gin !
And think you this great work Shall disappear?
No, no ! dear Wowserina ! Not this year !

A young lady-doctor at Adelaide Hospital
has had bad luck. And the patient, a boy
of 15, has had worse. He was struck in the
abdomen by a broken leather belting. The
wound seemed long, but not deep, so, having
attended to it, the doctor-girl sent him home.
A man-doctor saw him on the scene of the
accident, and another at his home ; and both
considered it a superficial cut. Yet, in two
or three days he got worse, and died quiclAy
of peritonitis. Then a post-mortem found,
right inside the bowels, a two-inch steel belt-
fastener. The Coroner asked about the boy’s
clothes, which somebody had described as
being undamaged. He sent for them. There
were three garments, and every one had a
small but clear hole in it! Then the fur
flew. Coroner Ramsay Smith is afraid of
nobody, and the things he said will probably
lead to a reorganisation of the junior staff
of the hospital. Some of the acidulated com-
ments
It is useless to expect anyone to believe that an
honorary surgeon or physician seeks a post out of
pure love for the sick p00r.... The Hospital Board—
I do not say in its wisdom ; 1 am going to use no
ambiguous terms —I say in its ignorance, because I
am certain that the majority of the members of that
Board had not the least idea of what they were doing
... .It is useless to imagine that the public, or even
the Hospital Board, can long be kept in ignorance of
the damage that is due by entrusting, or making
possible the entrusting, of the diagnosis, treatment
and care of serious cases to officers of the institution
who have not the skill and experience necessary, and
that are demanded, for the protection of life and for
the general comfort and cure of the patients.
Ramsay Smith was one of the two senior
men whom Kingston brought out from Eng-
land to run the Adelaide Hospital when the
big strike of local doctors took place 12 or
15 years ago; so he knows a few things
about the inside of the institution and isn’t
the usual magisterial prattler.
A JUST INDICTMENT.
THE LEADER OF THE BAND : "Mine frients,
the Australian peoples haf no soul for
music; only three beers haf we made this
day. Nein. ”
A FAMILIAR TERM.
MRS. JAY PAY: “I see a case here of a baby that only weighs three founds."
MR. J.P. (dozing): “Short weight , second ’fence, fine five pou”—
“E.0.R.”: I was accidentally digging
among the by-laws of the City of Hobart
(Tasmania.) in search of the regulation
dealing with insane perambulators when I
found this :—
No person shall ride, conduct, push or impel a
machine upon any footway made or set apart for the
use of foot passengers except for the purpose of
going to or from any' house or premises.
So, if you are going to the Devil, or going to
throw* yourself into the Derwent, or going
to perish on a mountain top, or going to cut
your throat in the middle of the Great Afri-
can Desert you must keep off the footpaths
of Hobart. But if you start on a bike or
motor-car in Hobart and are bound for
Buckingham Palace, London, or the Jumna
Musjid, Delhi, or the Mosque of St. Sophia,
Constantinople, you may drive on the pave-
ments of that humble Strawberry Island
city till all is blue. For you are assuredly
bound for “premises.” The miscreant who
said that Buckingham Palace wasn’t “pre-
mises” would, deserve, for his disloyalty, to
be torn asunder by wild sheep.

“Hamer”: There is something weirdly in-
human about the icy imperturbability of our
courts. Take a recent gun-loosing case. A
taxi-cabman is speaking: “Some words took
place, and Blank produced a revolver, saying
something about ‘fixing her.’ I said, ‘You
can’t do that sort of thing in
the car.’ A few minutes later I
heard the report of a revolver.
I thought something had hap-
pened, and rushed in.” They
manage their court ceremonies
better in the Latin countries.
There, when a citizen is ac-
cused of (say) stealing goods
to the value of 3s. a cer-
tain amount of glow is intro-
duced into the case. The ac-
cused interrupts the prosecutor
with a passionate declaration
that he is innocent, and makes
a public request to the Deity
to censure him with lightning
if he has sworn falsely. If
there are five witnesses, they
introduce at least 20 different
emotions before the advocates
have a chance. And by the
time the defending attorney
has dealt, in a voice breaking
with emotion, with the import-
ance of the accused to his aged
mother, grandmother and invalid sister-in-
law, and burst into tears, the whole Court,
including the Bench, is in such a condition
that the only way out is embraces all round.
Why can’t we introduce a little of this here?
It would be worth a very solid term of gaol
to see Magistrate Smithers, of Sydney, (say)
publicly kissed by a fowl-stealer and two
policemen.

A point is continually cropping up in
industrial matters that demands prompt
legislative settlement. That is whether an
employee can be compelled to work over-
time. All industrial awards fix a minimum
rate of pay for a minimum week’s work, extra
time to be paid for at an extra rate. It
appears however (at sea, anyhow), that an
employer can demand extra labor from his
employee, even if the latter does not desire
to work over the award hours. A case of
this sort recently came before the Water
Police Court (Sydney), when a seaman
on the Eden was prosecuted for refusing to
work. The master had ordered him to help
wash the decks on a Sundav, but the sailor
said it was his watch below, that he was
tired out, having already been on duty far
too long, and was not having any more just
then. He argued that the ship’s safety
might depend on him when he resumed duty,
and that, as he didn’t want overtime, and
the decks could wait, it was up to him to
have a sleep. The magistrate decided he
would have to donvict the seaman of refusing
a lawful order: but in view of the extra-
long hours he liad been on duty, let him off
with six hours cells. Such a prosecution
would be quite imnossible ashore, and, in
the circumstances described, should be equally
impossible afibat.
It takes a good deal to shock a parrot, but
there was one badly shocked in Adelaide
lately. It was not surprised. There was no
time for that. It was just shocked. It was
a very old bird, entirely out of luck. When
it escaped from its suburban home for a fly
round it happened to have a few inches of
steel chain dangling from its leg; and the
three wires that offered such a convenient
perch happened to be those conveying the
tramway power from Port Adelaide to the
City. The chain touched one wire and the
bird another, and that was all —just a flash
of lightning and some roast parrot. Then,
as a touching tribute to the bird’s memory,
every tramcar in and about the city stood
still, just where it happened to be, for the
space of about 5 \ minutes —after which the
remains were found and pulled down. It
was the busiest hour of the evening home-
rush, too. The tramway officials will tell
you all about the Blasted Parrot on the
slightest provocation.

“Pontius Potter” : I have discovered what
keeps people alive in those dingy houses that
Randolph Bedford wrote about (B. 20/3/’I3L
Sometimes it is a black-leaded window sill
or door-step, and other times a door-knob.
Opposite my humpy is a terrace of five cot-
tages. The windows
are hung with fly-
blown lace curtains,
and tousled-haired
youngsters are usually
squashing their noses
on the dirty glass.
Cobwebs of a genera-
tion prevent any sun
penetrating the fan-
lights, and the var-
nish is coming off the
front doors in flakes.
But each portal is
provided with a large
brass knob. This art-
ful addition by the
jerry builders keeps
the inhabitants from
being rushed off to the
lunatic asylum or the
gaol too frequently.
At most times of the
day a female can be
found attached to one
or other of the handles
with a rag and some
polish, doing her best
to make the knob out-
shine the one next
door. The woman in
the end house dropped
out of the competi-
tion recently, so I was
not surprised when
she strangled herself
effectually in the
woodshed with a
clothes line.
A real John Weary turned up in a Sydney
police court last week. He was charged
with stealing a set of harness, and, when he
cheekily asked the owner of the horse-clothes
whether he (Weary) hadn’t once worked
for him, the harness-owner first contradicted
him flatly, and then explained to the Bench
that he had once given Weary a reference
“just to help him along.” However, that
was in the far back days when Weary had
borne a good character. Later on. the weight
of the good character had proved too much
for Weary, so lie had cast it off, and, in a
moral sense, collapsed in a heap with the
stolen harness. The verdict was live months’
rest. The moral of the social tragedy seems
to be (a) that a charity reference is liable
to turn into a double-edged sword and a two-
headed adder, and (b) that very little save
yawns is to be expected of a human being
called Weary, or Restwell, or Feetup.
Melbourne Board of Health is arranging a
regulation making it illegal for a grocer to

The cry of “Bill” :
The boom that Manly has been on since surf-
bathing began to rage is in danger of a slump un-
less a cold, unrelenting eye is focussed on Sydney’s
City Council. Owing to the garbage-destructor at
Moore Park being unable to keep pace with require-
ments, the tip is in a horrible condition. Even the
Health Department has become insistent on improve-
ment, and the brilliant Gaud Mayor Cocks was de-
livered a few days ago of the remedy. This was to
turn the footsteps of the garbage cart from Moore
Park to the water-front, where the festering luggage
of the vehicle could be placed aboard punts, carted
outside the Heads and cast upon the bosom of the
current, which, by the way, sets into Manly beach.
It is the simple scheme of a plain man. The gar-
bage problem is solved; the surferagettes have no-
thing to do but pack their bathing costumes in their
purses and proceed to Coogee or Bondi; apd Manly
—well, Manly can take a spell to count up the un-
earned increment since the Bronzed Girl and the
Hairy Sunburnt came to gambol on the beaches.

yell,
When patriotic ardor makes my loyal bosom swell.
I am not old or feeble yet, no snow is on my hair ;
But here I sit like any old campaigner in a chair.
The clash of cymbals stirs my blood, the bugles stir
my feet;
The twinkling sticks the drummers ply upon my
strong heart beat.
Some primal lust the music stirs, but I must stand
aside,
And watch the silken banners toss upon the steel -
bound tide.
“Too old !” The weight of twenty years my bowed
head rests upon ;
So, when the young battalions pass, you’ll find me
looking on !
When brave young troops go by,
A veteran am I !

WHERE THE BOOT PINCHES.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
The bootmakers in the electorate represented by
Minister of Customs Tudor are wanting to know a
lot of things from the Labor candidate. The exist-
ing tariff has enabled cheap foreign makers to cut
great swathes out of the local trade, and the Rich-
mond shoemaker is finding the greatest difficulty in
sticking to his last.
“1 am a stout Protectionist,”
The sitting member said.
“If for a moment I desist,
And workmen find they rrtust subsist
On thinnest air instead
Of customary hread,
I greatly hope it’s understood
That my intentions all are good.”
The worker sitting by the wall,
With not a thing to do,
Knows that a harder fate may fall
Than half a loaf. It’s none at all.
He realises, too,
Through inward pangs a few,
’Tis in his stomach, now so slim,
That foreign boots are pinching him.

There is nothing better for a delicate child than a course
of Angier’s Emulsion. It makes the little ones eat better,
digest better, sleep better and rapidly gain in weight, strength
and colour. Doctors prescribe it for coughs, bronchitis
whooping cough and all lung affections ; also for scrofula,
rickets, malnutrition and for wasting diseases generally.
Angier’s Emulsion is pleasant to take and children all like it.

ALITIES
A HOLLOW MOCKERY,
HOUSEWIFE: "But you appear a big , strong
man.”
THIRSTY MENDICANT: “Ah, if madam could
only see how hollow I am."
“Doubter”: Must have been a special
brand of dingo (or whisky) that, according to
“Gouger” (B. 3/4/T3) attacked the old hatter in
the hills. The ordinary species of the beast is the
most cowardly on the continent. Knew an old gin
who had to pass through two miles of scrub coming
home at night from work. Often she would meet a
pack of dingoes (after the goats), whereupon she
would yelp like a dog, and run towards them. But
she never caught them. The way they hurled them-
selves at the horizon was a revelation in velocity.
* * * *
“Mallet”: I don’t know which State-
“E.S.S.” writes about (B. 10/10/’l2) when he says,
“the mountain duck is no better to eat than a bar
of soap or a tom cat.” The mountain duck, such
as lie describes, is much sought after by bushmen
in Westralia, and I can testify to its edibility. As
regards the musk duck, all “E.S.S.’s” remarks are
warranted, although I have heard that this species
is also edible if, immediately on shooting, the musk
bag (which hangs under the beak) is cut off. Can’t
testify to this from personal experience, however,
as I was always overpowered before I had a chance
to cut anything but a passage through the atmo-
sphere.
* * * *
“Mallarapoonie” : Many Australian Bingliis
have a wonderful power of voice manipulation. Have
heard them run through gamuts of sound, as a com-
mon thing in their sing-songs and corroborees, such
as no white person’s voice ever had register to com-
mand. More than that, it is no uncommon thing to
hear a native holding converse with another on the
intake of his breath —-a practice quite unknown
among whites. The peculiar throat formation of
many savages makes for almost habitual ventrilo-
quism. One of the best exponents of the art of
voice-projection I ever heard was a Wogite gin at
Bradshaw’s Run (N.T.). A party of Jumonjus from
the Fitzmaurice River, after some trouble about
cattle, had taken to the mountains, where, about
two miles away, they could be discerned like ants
against the skyline. In the still of one frosty even-
ing a brass-throated old gin on the station was told
off to expostulate with them. Beginning her utter-
ances somewhere down in the basement of things,
she ran up, in a series of weird tremolo modulations,
a scale of about six octaves to the top C. A feature
of each effort was the abruptness with which it ter-
minated. Silence seemed to fairly shut down on the
tail of it like the lid of Tophet slamming on the
protestations of a Lost Soul. One could hear the
last shrill quaver of it float out through space, and
t the echo of it vibrate and die out among the hills.
It was a, wonderful example of the range of a
human voice; and each time we could hear the
answering hail come back from the mountain top,
like a small, thin, gramophone-voice wailing in the
wilderness. Don’t know anything so penetrating,
unless it be the shriek of a State Fright when the
axe of Nationalism suddenly commences operations on
its backyard fence.
“Sebrof”: If there’s to be any skiting
about useful plants, I’m into it on behalf of the
cocoanut palm. Here are some of the uses to which
the natives in Ceylon put the tree: Leaves, for roof-
ing, mats, baskets, torches, fuel, brooms, fodder for
cattle and manure ; stem of the leaf for fencing, yokes
(d la John Chinaman) and fishing rods; the cabbage,
or cluster of uneX-
panded leaves at top
of the palm, for pickles
and preserves; sap,
for toddy, distilling
arrack (an intoxicat-
ing drink), making
vinegar and for sugar ;
the unformed nut, for
medicine; the young
nut, for drinking; the
green husk, for pre-
serves ; the nut, for
eating and for curry;
the oil, for rheuma-
tism, for anointing the
hair, for soap and
candles; the shell of
the nut, for cups, ehar-
c o a 1, toothpowder,
spoons, hookahs, beads,
bottles and knife-
handles ; the coir, or
fibre, which envelops
the shell within the
outer husk, for mat-
tresses, cushions, ropes,
lavas, fishing-nets,
brushes and mats; the
trunk for rafters, laths,
railing, boats, troughs,
and furniture. On one
occasion, a ship from
the Maidive Islands
called at Galle, and
was found to be built,
rigged, provisioned and
loaded solely with the
produce of the cocoa-
nut palm. If any Abo.-
writer goes one better
than this, I’ll know
exactly what- to call
his grandmother the
ancestor of; and. by
thunder, I’ll do it.
“W.A.C.”: Where are the highest ant
hills in Australia? I’ll quote North Queensland on
spec. Recently a telegraph wire (18ft. from the
ground) was earthed through contact with an ant
sky-scraper. But the lineman who reported the cause
of the fault had his work cut out to make the depart-
ment believe the news; in fact, it wasn’t until he
produced photographs of the locality that his reputa-
tion was rescued from destruction.
GROGAN (more in grief than anger): “ D’ yez see that now? After all the civility and
kindness I've been showin ’ that felly Ryan! An’ see him there, lyin’ dead drunk
over the way at Cassidy's!”
The Adelaide dailies lately reported a
mishap which sounded comic, but was really serious.
A Geranium Plains farmer sold an old Angora billy-
goat, but the affectionate beast made back to its old
home. It found its old master busy over a seed-
drill, and butted him from behind. When that hap-
pens in “Steele Rudd’s” stories, or in an American
Sunday supplement, it is always considered a matter
for merriment. In this case, the victim of the prodi-
gal goat was taken up stunned, with several ribs
broken, and other injuries hard to see the end of.
* * * *
“Eddyson”: Oakley made Rock’s ac-
quaintance in Sheehan’s bar at The Punt, and found
him more than a cut above Sheehan and the rest of
the adjacent male population. Rock was a big,
lean, ginger man, a prospector, with literary lean-
ings and fairly accurate opinions of politicians.
Oakley liked him, and agreed that they should travel
in co. as far as Two Kegs, which was Rock’s head
centre. “Bechune us two, Rock’s ez mad ez a moon-
sthruck ca’f,” whispered Sheehan before Oakley
drifted out. “Ye’d bether kape a live eye on him.”
This opinion did not impress Oakley, who knew
that out-backers are prone to regard the reserve of
a superior spirit as a form of dementia. On the
long tramp to Two Kegs he found nothing to
justify Sheehan’s estimate. Rock was talkative and
genial, with a touch of humor, and fresh, quaint
views of men and matters. He had small difficulty
in persuading Oakley to pass the night at his hut.
He prepared a good bush meal, provided whisky
and tobacco, and, later, told the story of Laver’s
finish. Laver had been his mate for 50 years, and
had broken his neck in a shaft close to where Rock’s
hut was built. Rock seemed much moved by the
awakened memories. “I wonder you go on living
so near the hole,” said Oakley. “I can’t leave it,”
replied Rock. “God knows poor Bill’s lonely enough
as it is! ” The night was fine and warm, and
Oakley unrolled bluey, and slept out of doors. He
slept well till on towards two in the morning, when
he woke to find himself being dragged quickly over
the rough ground. Rock had him by the left leg,
and was doing the hauling. Oakley’s host was in
his shirt, and his ginger hair was frisking in the
breeze. Oakley yelled, but Rock took no notice.
The prospector was talking to himself. “Right you
are, Bill. I’m coming! I’m coming! Square deal
it is, Bill.” Oakley kicked with his free leg, but
Rock paid no more heed than if a mosquito had
trodden on him. He brought Oakley, with many a
bang, and half a hundred cuts, scrapes and bruises,
to the mouth of the abandoned shaft, and the poor
devil had just time to realise what was happening
when he was tumbled down, neck and crop. The
hole, though deep, was narrow, and Oakley, as an
old miner, had just sense enough to do the best he
could for himself. He threw his body across, put
out arms and legs, and worked a brake, striking
footholes about 30ft. down, and bringing up there.
There was silence for a moment; then Rock’s face
appeared at the moonlit mouth of the shaft. “Be-
low!” he said. “Below! There’s company for you
at last, Bill.” Oakley succeeded in making the sur-
face again, but not without a long struggle. Then
he left, minus his swag. It seemed to him that
Sheehan was right, after all.
“Mulga Bill” : Talk about Australian wit
and humor! Get thee to a pubbery in an up-
country town at race-time. • First night at our re-
cent outbreak all the boots outside the various bed-
rooms were mixed up and filled with water. (Roars
of laughter!) Next night, mere ordinary horse-
play ; nothing brilliant until dawn, when about a
dozen roosters, that had been smuggled into bed-
rooms by the talent began to crow long and dis-
mally. (Shrieks!) The third night a barrel was
rolled into the front corridor and a blithered
member of the comic coterie was mounted on a
“borrowed” horse to leap over it. When the con-
vulsions of merriment had faded, the blithered
humorist was escorted to the local hospital (he
was still there when I left a fortnight later), and
the overjoyed pubkeeper had collected a cheque
covering the cost of the damage twice over. No-
body grudged it ; it was the Funniest Time on Earth.
BETWEEN TWO
DRINKS.
THIRSTY SAM: “ How
happy could I be
with either.”
Victoria isn’t finished yet. At Merbein,
just beyond the terminus of the Mildura line, so situ-
ated that 70 miles of easily-built railway would
serve it, there is an area of nearly threequarters of
a million acres of cultivable land lying practically
unused. It is held on grazing lease, terminable by
Ministerial decision. R. Barr-Smith, F. J. Fisher
and Arthur Crozier use it to run a few sheep, whereas
a thousand families should, and some day soon will,
be living comfortably on it. The annual rental of
this principality amounts to £4436. The Weary
Ministry could throw open these blocks to-morrow
and have a railway built in six months ; but it is
too busy battling for State rights against the Ref-
erendum proposals to attend to its own proper
business in that way.
THE SHEEP CURE.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
The report on inebriate retreats, Mr. Murray re-
marked, should be sufficient to indicate to the public
that a valuable work was being done on lines
of economy,. . The Lara institution found it economi-
cal to raise its own mutton, and he believed firmly
in attaching as large areas as possible to inebriate
asylums, since, quite apart from the economical
standpoint, it afforded the patients healthful exer-
cise.—Melbourne Argus.
When you chase the jumbuck, cursing, eke from
hither unto Von,
And you find, at yon arriving, that the greasy
blighter’s gone,
And 3'ou have your sweat for nothing, while about
a quarter-peck
Of yard-dust has proceeded down your warm, per-
spiring neck —
It’s then you think a cool, damp thought of how,
when you were dry,
You’d turn to beer for quenching, in the wicked days
gone by.
Blue ruinwards the track was never dusty, never
rough,
When you browsed among the beer-leaves, and you
never had enough—
When you chased the long, moist sleever up and
down the dear old town.
Looking fondly, full and foolish, on the beer when
it was brown;
And a pint of beer, at thruppence, gave much joy
for little cash....
Hi! Oh, hi! you cow! (Bump, wallop.) Oh, you
crimson— (biff and bash) !
Noon, night, early in the morning, when the street
was whirling round.
And your truly trifling troubles in a sea of beer
were drowned —
All the time you wore good clobber: one clean collar
every day,
And a shirt-front dawn-reflecting, as you corkscrewed
on your way.
Ah, j'ou never thought that some time, when your
beer had done you brown,
You’d win back in shirt-’n’-trousers, chasing jum-
bueks up and down!
Long the day, and dry and dusty, beerless, brown
and bustling now,
When you labor with the ready sweat of sheep-work
on 3 - our brow.
Long the day and short the liquor, as in clouds Of
dust you go
Kp and down, and in and out, and round and round,
and to and fro ;
Yet it’s cheap you are, and useful, with salvation
drawing near,
When you mend - our broken manhood, chasing sheep
instead of beer.
VICTORIA.

“C.S.”: Bike “Kola” (B. 27/3/T3), I'm
hungering for knowledge as to what is the use of
6kiting about a White Australia when Chows,
Afghans and Hindus are.allowed to marry our own
women and breed piebalds into the race. Kiandra
(N.S.W.) is an object-lesson. The gold-rush there
swept in the inevitable Chow and Ram Shirttail, the
hawker, and there are cases where the offspring of
the former and white women have been married to
Ram and his brothers. I know a half-bred Binghi
who became the legal consort of a half-caste Chinese
girl. And, because we haven’t enough intelligence
to prevent these horrors, the children are classified
as Australians.
IN TOPHET.
EYEUS : “ What's this?"
FORKUS: “An election candidate is meeting
some o f his bogies."
“Eryander”: That “snake-sense” men-
tioned by “K.H.K.,” (B. 10/4/’l3) is not so very
uncommon. I have known several men who pos-
sessed it, and one woman—-the last unerringly. She
was the wife of a friend with whom I used to stay
sometimes, near Tambo, in Gippsland. Mrs. Blank
always knew when a snake came near the house;
or, at all events, when she said “Snake!” snake it
always was. One sweltering summer night, when
her husband was going to throw open the front door,
she stopped him. “Get the gun, Tom,’’ she said,
“and I’ll hold a candle low down. There’s a snake
somewhere just outside.” Cautiously the husband
opened the door, and the light fell at once on a big
brownie, coiled comfortably right upon the step. Of
course he bolted, but the charge of No. 6 caught up
to him. I asked the lady if her warnings were
founded on any special bodily sensations. “Not
that I am aware of,” she said. “I just seem sud-
denly to know ; that’s all I can explain about it.
It began with me as a girl of 14, when I found a
tiger snake in my bed. Ever since I’ve had this
peculiar instinct, or whatever you like to call it.”
COMPENSATION.
FAIR VISTIOR: “Oh, what a lovely dog! Where did you get him?”
BILLY (who boasted the best looking gin in the town): “Boss him bad phellah. He run
away longa my gin. By cripes, I nick his dog get square.”
“Platman”: “Wal” rushed in where a
well-seasoned beach-comber would have feared to
tread when he recently denied my statement that
Cooktown (Q.) blacks and those on the east coast of
the Peninsula did not use the boomerang. Writing
from the spot, I can state definitely that the weapon
is not used here (Cooktown), or by the Annan
blacks. Also, in the collection of native weapons in
the Sydney Museum a card over the boomerang col-
lection reads: “Unknown in Tasmania
and (perhaps) in York Peninsula.”
Joseph Banks in his journal notes
that the natives of Sting Ray (now
Botany) Bay had short wooden
swords shaped like a scimitar, but
although he, with Cook’s party, spent
some five weeks on the banks of the
Endeavor, and gives a description of
the weapons used (with a diagram of
the throwing stick or womera), he
makes no mention of anything resem-
bling the boomerang. It is a fair de-
duction that even at that period there
were none amongst the local blacks,
for it is hardly likely such a careful
and accurate observer as Banks would
have failed to note what is recognised
as one of the most peculiar of primi-
tive weapons. Some of the old hands
state that in all probability the exhi-
bitions of boomerang throwing seen by
“Wal” were given by boys recruited
from the Johnstone River or Palm
Islands. If the old hands are wrong,
I don’t know wno “vVal” is going to fall back on.
Personally., I always fall back on an old hand.
* * *
“Sardonyx”: Seems they're talking of
dynamiting the flying-foxes that have found hitherto
a peaceful home in the National Park, near Sydney.
Dynamite is no use in such a case, unless a big
charge could be fired right over the top of a roosting-
tree. Have known a charge of “dinny” exploded
at the foot of a tree. Tore a terrific hole in the
ground, but did little damage aloft. The most
effective “fox” antidote is just plain gunpowder—
with a charge of No. sin front of it. Nothing like
the gun, as I ascertained while doing my share to-
wards a total of over 3000 corpses for five gur.s in
about three hours. And the bright smell haunts me
still.
“A.A.G.” : The casualness of Black Sister
in the matter of adding to the population, as men-
tioned by “Leichhardt'’ recently, is correct enough
Knew a Maori woman who climbed out of a buggv
near Hastings (M.L.), and inside half an hour
climbed back with an addition to the passenger list.
And she hadn’t borrowed it, either. But White
Sister can be just as casual, as witness the case not
long ago in Gisborne (M.L.), where a European girl
went out with her boy, left him suddenly, and in a
short period returned with a chee-ild that she had
given birth to in the scrub. Her companion gave
evidence later that there was nothing unusual about
her when she came back to him, except that “she
looked a bit cronk.”
“Bulloak” : His name was Count Boris
Grovenski before Poland became too hot for the
soles of his feet and he took to shepherding sheep
for Morrison, of Australia. He was tall, thin, very
dignified; and while his sheep grazed he studied
books in Greek and other cob-webbed languages.
Naturally, the reprimand of Morrison was frequent
and characteristically torrid; but his Excellency
accepted it in calm silence. Even the longest Count
will turn, however, and one day Grovenski revoluted.
Drawing himself up, his aged and crumbling topper
in one hand, the other hand pressed to his heart, he
bowed and said: “Have you quite feenished, Meester
Morreeson?” Morrison reckoned he had. “Well,”
says the Count, “I have von leetle commun-i-casiong
to make to you. Shephaird your perludy sheep your-
seelf. Ihe last I saw of him he was heading slowly
for the horizon with his library on his back.
SKETCHES AT OUR BUSH PUB.
An impromptu candlestick.
“Sarto”: Permit me to settle this barb-
wire fence scuffle. It is positively unwise to sav
that a small swag couldn’t be pushed through a five-
wire fence (with two barbs) erected 10 years be-
fore. I know of two separate fences built of sleeper
posts and six wires (three plain and three prickly),
with the difference in their structure that one has
two iron droppers in each panel (24ft. panel in each
fence), while the other hasn’t. The fence with the
droppers (erected about five years) is a hard propo-
sition to a small-sized jim-jam to get through, while
the other one (erected, say, three years), in which
any two of the wires can be made" to meet, would
give easy access to a battleship if it wasn't too
large. Each of these fences encloses a well-grassed
paddock in the middle of a common, while outside
is practically void of grass; yet there is not one
instance on record of stock having been ruined on
either. Any wire fence (plain or barb) without
droppers will slacken; any with droppers will defy
Old Nick to get through after his tail, provided the
posts will stand.

The mates thought it out that night. “It’s all
owing to yer love for strong drink, Snooker,” and
Sandy fixed the little man with a reproachful, blood-
shot eye Snooker thought his chum had suddenly
gone mad when the long man, jumping up, chuckled

Thirty-two shadowy bullocks trampling down his

there was no mistaking Sandy’s intention, but the

heartedness behind the long whip. One end of the

S.S.S. Sivani, the old Ki-wai corporal
of police, told me how the Fly River men get
birds of paradise. Armed with ' bows and arrows
they creep to their locality (where the dancing
trees are) before the birds home at sunset. The
hunters, climbing a high and leafy tree, stay there
ill night, and when the birds begin to dance in
the hours at dawn they shoot them, silently. One
arrow will often spike three birds. At
Mauviani village I saw a rose-pink bird,
and traded it from a native for lib. of
tobacco. I did not know it was against
the law to purchase them, and, in my
youthful innocence, showed it to a newlv-
made and most conscientious R.H. lie
shook his head sagely and said I must
g,ve it back or go to gaol. I would
sooner have bought his old gaol for cash
and given it to a blind beggar for road
material, but he wouldn’t listen to
reason. I never saw another like it (an-
other bird, I mean, for gaols like his
were as common as lies). Up at Lake-
kamu, amongst the mountains, I saw four
Heginas dancing on a bow before a back-
ground of purple orchids, and a royal
Miie butterfly, big as a man’s palm, silently flut-
tering in the vicinity. It was the poetry of God.
Even when Croesus, the richest monarch of his time,
was up a tree, he was not attired like one of these.

F.11.R.”: Talking about bees recently,
someone remarked that honey was about the purest
of our foods. Well, if bees are domiciled within
miles of an ordinary farm, I’ll back them as scaven-
gers against flies. Look casually around the foulest
corner of a pigsty, and there you’ll find the busy
beast. In drains, cowyards, or any of the many un-
savory , , slimy corners that abound on an ordinary
farm, 1 11 back the bees to be busiest on any sunny
morning. If the bee is the clean and spotless fowl
that she is alleged to be, what is she doing there?
C iows, hyenas, alligators, sharks, etc., are denounced
as scavengers, but I never saw a shark flying about a
pigstye, or a hyena on the wing near a pile of
carrion. I believe the bee leads a double life, and
calls herself a blowfly in her dissipated moments in
order to-disguise her identity.
THE DARLING RIVER.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
I am the Roadway and the Route
Whence Life’s essentials come;
I bring Invention’s ripened fruit—
The segment and the sum.
1 am the Harbinger of Hope ;
1 am the Commonweal,
\\ hen through the Gates my steamers grope
With mud from stem to keel 1
Because these boats dread dangers dare
I bring you bread and meat,
The dainty robes your women wear,
The daintier things you eat.
The lager brewed in Adelaide,
A thousand miles away,
Upon your tables shall be made
The order of the day!
And when the western world is still,
And all its troubles cease,
It shall be mine alone to fill
Your fragrant pipes of peace.
From where the sprawling camels swing
(My drab co-partners these!)
To homestead and to camp I bring
My sunset argosies.
The ocean-roaming “salts” may laugh
My narrow paths to scorn,
But I am Famine’s cenotaph,
And Cornucopia’s Horn !
The deep-sea skippers all may sneer
Through tempest-trodden brine ;
But this I ask: Can any steer
As loyally as mine?
Which one can ride upon the flood,
Soup-thick, and inches high ?
And could he fniss the murd’rous mud,
Or dangers dark defy ?
It’s easy, with a thousand leagues
Of charted ocean room,
To dodge the Storm-God’s wild intrigues
And Davy’s crack of doom.
But these brown men of mine, I vow,
Are braver than the best
Who ever aimed a liner’s prow
North, south, or east, or west.
They sport no gold medallions, and
They wear no diamond pins ;
But, oh ! how -well they understand—
And suffer for their sins !

A DOUBTFUL PLEASURE.
MELBOURNE, Monday.—The Liberals in Victoria will have
most to fear from a superfluity of candidates... Mr. C. James, a
young lawyer, is challenging Mr. John Quick in Bendigo, and
challenging coincidently the Labor candidate. Entering the
field as a Freetrader in a district which is supposed to be moth-
eaten with Protection, he is gaining more support than either
party cares about. .. The younger voters, and the women voters
in particular, seem to be giving acceptance to Frectrade views
to an extent that was not quite hoped for by the propagandists.
-D. TELEGRAPH, with mingled feelings.
JOE (excitedly): “Wot luck! ’Ere I'm tied t’ this ere tony tart
uv Alf’s, oo’s, arf ashamed uv me, an’ blest if that don’t look
like dear ole Frectrade Liz cornin’ over the ’ill—an' just at a
time when me an er might profitably work the subbubs and
country t'gether.”

PERSONAL
ITEMS
Joe Cook has got back on all the news-
papers that ever peaked at him. In his
nomination paper he described himself as a
journalist.
[S. IT. Prior, The Bulletin Office, Sydney.]
Dr. A. K. Newman, of Wellington, M.L.,
has completed his bonk, “Who Are the
Maoris?” a job which has been on his mind
these 15 years past. He takes up Percy
Smith’s swag where M.L.’s ex-Surveyor-
General dropped “Hawaiki” in the Malay
Archipelago, and carries it right up to the
top of Northern India, claimed to be the
original home of the Henare family. New-
man is a politician of long standing (that is
to say he started to sit in the House of
Reps, in 1884), and is one of two members
of the Tory party whom louseph Ward never
forgave for their criticisms during the
trouble in connection with the winding Up
of. the Colonial Bank. (Seeing that the
editor of this paper had his umbrella stolen
in the Colonial Bank’s Dunedin office in
1883 he doesn’t feel very forgiving either.)
Newman is a cheerful identity, a good sport,
and remembers with difficulty that he is 64
years of age.
About the strangest jest the Northern
Territory has seen happened the other day,
when the Director of Lands (salary £B5O a
year) was called out on strike as a member
of the Australian Workers’ Union, and put
on picket duty outside Government House.
And the second-best jest happened when an
editor who had criticised the local Judge
was brought up before the embittered plain-
tiff, and as the Judge found on his own
unanimous verdict that he had done nothing
to deserve the criticism the editor got the
shock of his life. In other words, he was
fined £lOO and sent to gaol pending pav-
ment. Then Darwin rose as one man, and
as Tory and Laborite and priest and atheist
all wrnnted to subscribe towards/ the fine
it was necessary to restrict the amount that
each man might pay. So nossibly the Judge
also got the shock of his life.

(Vic.) :
NOTICE.
If the person who poisoned my two dogs does not
apologise within 7 days, I will pray that he or she
may die of cancer.—A A .
Godfrey Watson, starter to the V.R.C. and
V.A.T.C., who died the other day, was one
of a band of ultra-sporting brothers. There
were nine of them. They were all born in
Ireland; and they could all do one or more
things in the horsey line superlatively well.
Godfrey was perhaps the finest horseman of
the lot. He rode innumerable steeplechases
in Australia, and never one bad race.
Once, while negotiating the big fences at
Caulfield, his horse’s belly-band broke. The
journey was only half finished. Watson
somehow got the saddle overboard, and
finished the race bare-back. There are not
many who can cling to a horse’s naked hide
over so much as one tall obstruction, let
alone a dozen or more. An elder brother
in Ireland hunts the Meath Hounds. His
language when annoyed is dreadful. Incident-
ally, he mostly is annoyed when hunting. As
a four-in-hand whip he is considered by good
judges to have no superior anywhere. Tom
Watson, who starts horses in and about Syd-
ney, has hunted, steeple-chased, and played
polo during most of his life. He is too stout
now to ride anything smaller than a dinosaur
across country, but the old interest in the
game abides. No country but Ireland could
evolve a family just like this.
LOOKING FOR WORK.
The first Federal note, which is to be issued with
some ceremony to-day, is to be numbered by the
Hon. Judith Denman, daughter of the Governor-
General. A presentation will be made of the note
as a memento of the occasion.
DIRTY DAN: “ Look 'ere, mister! This num-
berin' notes ain’t no womans work—I don’t
mind doin' it on the same terms."
Adelaide’s veteran philanthropist, Edwin
Smith, has been throwing money about
lately. He has just started, at the age of
83, on an English trip. Before leaving he
collected £5OOO for the Blind, Deaf and
Dumb. He gave £2OOO himself, got £lOOO
from another veteran, Barr Smith, and
struck his friends for the balance in hun-
dreds and fifties. As soon as he had gone,
his attorneys announced that he had left
cheques of his own for pretty well every
other charity in Adelaide —about £5500 in
that lot. Beer was the foundation of the
Smith fortune, and judicious investment has
done the rest.
From the man whose name is where the
law says it should be: —
The Australian backbone was handed the following
crumb- of discomfort, in regard to the proposed log of
the Rural Workers’ Union, in the Argus of the 28th
ult. .
“The milker is to do nothing but milk, wash up
the cans and clean the bails. The laborer who grows
the feed is another kind of specialist. His particular
duties are to plough and harrow, and for this, under
the Rural Workers’ log, he is to receive £4 3s. per
week.”
Looking up the references I keep for such occasions,
I find from a previous Argus statement that a week’s
wages for a ploughman (48 hours) are two golden
quids, and not £4 35., as stated. However, in a
subsequent Argus computation, the allowance for
“looking after horses” is put down at 7s. 6d. ; for
keep, 165.; for “overtime, say, 10 hours,” 12s. 6d. ;
and for allowance, when employed less than four
weeks, 6s. This puffs up the total to an improbable
£4 2s. for a week of 58 hours, which is not quite
Is. sd. per hour for a heavy 10 hours; and it quite
omits to include the 40s. a week which the horses’
fodder will cost and the 635. which the vet. will
charge when one of the animals suffers from dry
bible or some other weird complaint. If these items
are included, it will be as plain as mud that the
ploughman’s wages are £8 9s. per week. Meantime,
the farmer-man, newly-arisen in the morning from
a deep sleep, reads his Argus, and having no time to
sort out lies from truth, votes against Labor as
usual, and then goes peacefullv to feed the pigs.

The Bulletin’s “Oldest Inhabitant” en-
tered his 74th year on May 9.
From “Rosna” in London :
Premier Peake and Speaker O’Loughlin of S.A.,
and Victoria’s Premier Watt have arrived in a bunch
to look at this little isle, and the local reporter is
wrestling with Australian geography in the old, old
way. The Westminster Gazette called Mr. Watt
“Premier and Leader of the Liberal Party of the
State of Victoria, N.S.W.” Another scribe, in a
violent outburst of rhetoric, said he had taken on
the mantle of Elijah, was the Randolph Churchill of
the Victorian Assembly, a Prince Rupert in debate
and quite Disraelian in character. He forgot to
mention he was also the Aristophanes of Melbourne,
the Solon of Australasia, the Julius Caesar of the
Southern Hemisphere, and the Apollo Belvidere of
Canberra, but these points may be noticed later.

How few know the facts about the patron saint
of Merrie England. He was a Cappadocian by birth,
and by trade a swindling army-contractor in the
pork-supplying line. He was likewise that old-time
Bishop whom Edward Gibbon gibbetted as a prize
rascal and confidence man. When the Arians got the
upper hand of the Athanasians, George was made
Primate of Egypt. He was wealthy, having acquired
a fortune by supplying bad bacon at high
prices to the defenders of his country. As Arch-
bishop of Alexandria, he got a monopoly of the nitre,
salt, paper and funeral trades. He also made a bit
here and there as an informer. And he was the origina-
tor of the house-tax. The speed and diversity with
which George garnered in, boodle, in those days,
fairly stupefied his contemps. Finally, the people
arose and threw him into prison, and, in doing so,
man-handled him so severely that he died. His body
was cast into the sea, a.d. 363. Pope Gelasius
(a.d. 494) was the first Catholic to acknowledge St.
George, and place him among the martyrs. How-
ever, such distinguished Cappadocian saints as Basil
and the Gregories were ignorant of the holiness of
their companion to the last. His ghost got into the
hagiology of both the Latin and the Greek churches,
and finally he became the national saint of England.
Tradition did much for him. The Arian persecutor
was transformed into a young and handsome prince,
a soldier martyred at the command of the Roman
Emperor Diocletian, a kind of Christian Perseus, of
whom a thousand prodigies were reported. Among
other exploits he was represented to have slain ail
’immense and fearsome beast, yclept “The Dragon,”
and saved the life of a king’s daughter just as this
dreadful minotaur was about to devour her. The
Crusaders first introduced him to Europe. In 1348
Edward 111. of England made George of Cappadocia
the patron saint of the Order of the Garter; and
from there he marched swiftly to his present proud
position.
“Hori” takes some snapshots:—
After taking a long course of the Dominions
Royal Commish, I sum the members up this way.
Britisher Lorrimer, Canadian Foster and Maorilander
Sinclair ask the most sensible questions; Tatlow
the fewest and Garnett the least important. New-
foundland Bowring is the politest. Garnett is the
most bumptious and cross-examines witnesses like
a police court lawyer until he can bamboozle them
to give the answer he requires. He is also the Beau
Brummel of the crowd and looks like Wilson Barrett
in “The Silver King.” Haggard is the flag-wagger ;
he uses the best language and asks questions spas-
modically. Vincent is a typical big-gun English
chairman and great at curbing too voluble witnesses.
Donald Campbell (Australia) is the youngest.
Vincent is the handsomest and Haggard the plainest.
Haggard’s trousers are a sculptured nightmare. They
resemble the trousers to be found on statues to de-
parted suburban mayors. He can put them on to
face either way and it makes no difference. Secre-
tary Harding upholds the dignity of Hold Hingland.
His attitude suggests a personal affront that so
much of the Commission’s time should be wasted on
mere colonials.
The way Parliamentary candidates describe
themselves in their nomination papers is farci-
cal but it’s the people’s fault. For instance,
W. G. Spence describes himself as a miner.
Now, it is 35 years or thereabouts since
Spence heaved a pick underground, and the
fine old man—7o or more now—couldn’t be
a miner again if he tried. Josiah Thomas
is another “miner.” and it is close on quar-
ter of a century since he did his last little
bit of sulphide gouging. As a matter of
tact, both of these men, and dozens besides
have made a profession of politics ; yet men-
tion professional politician and people shy
off. though if you asked them to go to any-
body else but a professional toothsmith to
get a tusk drawn they would suspect there
was lunacy in the family.

STAR EE, OF
MELBOURNE.
William Thompson Busby, of the Com-
mercial Bank of Sydney, who died last week,
was son of Dr. George Busby, who went to
Bathurst, in 1532, as Colonial Surgeon.
The doctor’s wife (who died in 1907, aged 97
years, 75 of them spent in the “City of the
Plains”), described her first journey over the
Mountains in a pamphlet a v e ar or two
before her death. Penrith was the first sfim;
the second night was spent at Springwood;
“The Weatherboard” was the next; Mount
York then, followed by Wallerawang, and
Sorn Bank, the home of the Campbells. The
house built for her at Bathurst still stands
on the bank of the Jordan Creek, in Ilowick-
street. Another Busb.v son, George, was
manager of the Commercial Bank at Bath-
urst for many years.
April 27 was the 17th anniversary of the
death of Henry Parkes, who began to be a
Minister in N.S.W. as far back as January,
1866, and finished the job of being Premier
of N.S.W. in October, 1891. He was Premier
five times, like Cowper and Ilobertson.
Martin was Premier three times and Pibbs
three times. Henry Parkes’s youngest son,
Cobden, will presently come of age, when
the annuity granted by Parliament to aid
the widow and family will cease. An appli-
cation, it is understood, will be made to the
N.S.W. Legislature to continue the pension
to the widow. There is also a daughter un-
married. for whom, it is suggested, that pro-
vision should be made. Only the children of
the second wife were provided for in the
Act. The offspring of the first marriage
did not want help, and the third wife was
childless.
That big Australian democrat and good Syd-
ney citizen, J. D. Fitzgerald, has had peremp-
tory orders to quit work and take a long, loaf-
ing voyage. He had just accepted a seat on the
Commission of three which is to do some
more reporting on the Greater Sydney mat-
ter when the doctors broke the news to him.
It won’t be as good a commission without
him, no matter who takes his place; for

seeing that it can’t get him for the job, has
given him an honorary corr>mi?«ion to repor

They never knew!
Those loyal folk of Hamilton,
Although the sun, as usual, shone,
And skies were blue,
They never knew !
The Governor was in the town,
And in the streets walked up and down
On his OWN feet! A splendid sight!
He first advanced the left. The right
Then swung ahead, ere something cleft
The atmosphere! His peerless left!
So he progressed o’er ruts and bumps
In wonderful vice-regal jumps,
Spurning the earth he hopes to rule
Like any common walking fool!
It is a dreadful thing to say;
The Governor was there that day,
And no one knew
(Except a few).
They might have gazed on Greatness there.
But no one told them ! Unaware,
His Ex. passed through
And no one knew!

With truth he’s English through and through.

The WILD CAT
COLUMN
The State revenue returns for the month
make no fresh disclosures. The Gadarene swine are
still rushing down the steep place with the bad
bump at the bottom. The shiftless N.S.W. Govern-
ment has on various accounts spent £22,919,029 this
year, or £4,030,236 more than it did in the cor-
responding 10 months of last year, and most of the
extra money has, of course, been borrowed. The
straight-out loan expenditure has reached £7,136,747.
The Government is now largely loafing on casual
overdrafts; the revenue and loan accounts, which
were in credit three years ago, are overdrawn to the
extent of £6,482,676. Money has been squandered
so recklessly, and such wretched value has been got
for it, that the railways already begin to talk of
increased fares and freights. Increased costs are put
forward as the excuse; but the increased costs are
very largely the result of the fictitious prosperity
which has followed the slopping out of mill ons of
borrowed money. While this money is still being
slopped out, it is easy enough for the public to come
up to the scratch and pay the interest. When the
slop stops and the interest doesn’t stop there will
be a squeal.
Victoria doesn’t show what it spends. In its re-
venue returns the old spring is missing. For 10
months the receipts were £7,920,402, or only
£27,487 more than last year; and the Common-
wealth for last month alone paid it £26,652 more
than it did in April, 1912. In Queensland the
alleged surplus is now £496,551, or £207,500 less
than it was at this time last year. The increase in
railway revenue ( £220,438) hasn’t equalled the in-
crease in railway expenditure ( £229,543) ; and on
top of that there is £148,059 more interest to pay
on the public debt. Westralia has managed to pull
down its accumulated deficit from £396.495 to
£391,548 in the 10 months, though one can’t forget
Westralia’s vicious old habit of charging “repairs to
glass houses” and such-like to loan aceount-r—the
simplest of all ways of faking a surplus. S. Aus.
preserves its usual profound silence on a matter of
such utter unimportance as its financial position;
and Tasmania, while it doesn’t mention its out-
goings, confesses with pride that it has in 10
months collected £18,473 more from its own people,
while the special Commonwealth dole to the poor
sister just about doubles that amount.

With the A.M.P. every year is a record year. It
might have got old and fat and lazy, and it threat-
ened to. It was too far ahead of all others: it was
getting big figures too easily, and while it was doing
better than others, it was not doing as well for its
policy-holders as it should have done. Then came
the amalgamation of three other offices, and a general
shaking up, and the A.M.P. found itself blessed with
some real competition. After 54 years it had achieved
an annual income of £2,509,729; after another ten
the figures have mounted to £3,855,890. And that
is not the best part of it. When they were making
their great dash the Yankee offices piled on tre-
mendous figures ; but they did it at tremendous cost,
whereas the A.M.P., under somewhat similar circum-
stances, has actually reduced its expense rate. By one
method of reckoning, the figures have certainly crawled
up an inch or two during the past few years; but
they are still less than they were 10 years ago:—

In 1911 there was a spring of £30,272 in the out-
goings and last year another of £16,259. But to a
great extent this was the result of the higher cost
of living, and a very proper consequent increase in
salaries, etc. ; and the office got some compensation
in the higher earnings of its own money. Further,
if the amount of new business is considered (and it
is the new business that costs the money) the society
is getting more for its outlay than ever it did in the
past 20 years. Allowing 7 p.c. for the cost of work-
ing the old business, and 3 p.c. for the new annuity
(single-premium) business, and assuming that the
balance of the exes, was absorbed in getting the new
business, this is how things have been going

The reduction from the figure shown for 1908 ought to
make policy-holders feel good; for reduced costs
mean bigger bonuses, other things being equal.
And, as mentioned above, other things are better
than equal. Thus, besides the reduction in costs,
there has been an improvement in interest earnings;
and that means bigger bonuses too. Bonuses come
from three sources: (1) a lower expense rate than
was assumed when the rate of premium was fixed •
(2) higher interest earnings than the actuaries
figured on; (3) a better death rate than was
assumed, which means the receipt of premiums for
more years than the mortality tables' had led the
office to expect—and that, again, is largely a matter
of carefully selecting the risks. The premiums which
the office expects to collect on the policies in force
total £31,024,847. Of that amount the actuaries
estimated that £6,337,262 would be required for
expenses—an average, that is, of 20.4 p.c. But the
actual expenses and sums written off last year were
only 14.5 p.c. of the premium income: the balance
\\ a® profit, available for bonuses. The actuaries
assumed that interest at the rate of 3 p.c. in some
cases and 34 p.c. in others would be earned. This
shows what was actually done:—

1906 4 9 7 „ L9ll 4 9 8
1907 4 911 „ 912 410 5
The difference between the assumed 3 or 34 p.c. and
the actual £4 10s. sd. p.c. is also profit, available
for bonuses. The balance of profit comes from the
favorable mortality experience before-mentioned. On
that point, however, no information is available for
the past year.
The first thing to be looked to in an insurance
office is solvency. The fact that an actuary makes
a report on which a big bonus is declared is not
in itself proof of solvency. There are two sides
to the business: the actuarial and the financial.
The actuary says—“ Assuming that your funds will
earn (say) 3 p.c., you ought to have so much put
by at this moment towards meeting future claims.
Anything more that you have is surplus available
for distribution.” The financial man says—“We
have so much,” and the actuary takes his word for
it. If his word is good, all right; if it isn’t, the
more inflated the bonus now, the worse the trouble
presently. The quality of the assets —whether they
are worth and are likely to go on being worth 20s.
in the £—is therefore of the utmost importance.
This shows the distribution of the funds now and 10
years ago:—
1902. 1912.

Foreclosures . . . . 2.9 ~ 0.4 ~
Loans on policies . . . . 21.3 ~ 16.8 ~
Other assets .. .. 4.1 ~ 3.4 ~
The changes have been all for the better. Public
securities are the best securities there are ; and there
has been a fine increase under that head. Foreclosures
are, on the whole, about the worst; and these have
been got rid of until hardly any are left. The
premises account is commendably small. Furniture,
etc., has been written right off. Loans on policies
have shrunk ; and since one of the worst things you
can do with an insurance policy is to pawn it, that
shrinkage is good too, though the loans may be
profitable business for the society. Altogether the
position from this point of view is admirable. The one
complaint that can be made is that though the Invest-
ment Fluctuation Fund amounts to only £36,463,
which isn’t nearly large enough to provide for con-
tingencies in a business of this size, only £IO,OOO
has been added to it during the year, though
£22,042 of profit was made on the sale of fore-
closed properties and other securities. It would
have been far better to have given the Investment
Fluctuation Fund the benefit of the whole lot. The
actuary, however, makes amends by recommending
that £155,000 of his surplus should be transferred
to a contingency account; but that is an internal
reserve for the protection in the first place of the
actuarial calculations.
As to bonuses, here is a comparison stretching
back 25 years:—
1888-1893 (boom years) .. 40.3 p.c. of premiums
1893-1898 34.1
1898-1903 34.8 ”
1903-1908 36.0 „ ”
1909 36.5 „
1910 .. 38.4 „
1911 38.5 „
1912 38.5 „
But for the 114th time The Bulletin remarks that
big bonuses, though important, are not everything.
In making comparisons between various offices, for
instance, these things have also to be taken into
account: (1) The amount of the premium. It is
quite easy for an office to put a bonus back into
the policy-holder’s trousers pocket if it first takes
in out of his vest. (2) The amount of the loading
for some alleged defect. Some offices load one-third
of their policy-holders, and don’t always mention the
fact either. (3) Whether premiums are reckoned on
“nearest birthday” or “next birthday.” It isn’t a
large matter; but the office which charges you as if
you were 40 when you are actually only 394 can
naturally afford to do a bit better for you in the
way of bonuses than the one which reckons you only
39. These remarks are, however, thrown in on
general principles, and have no special application
to the A.M.P.
industrial department.

Even in the hands of the A.M.P. it is a sad business ;
for, though this society’s industrial premiums average
nearly Is. a week, which is far above the average of
industrial premiums in other offices, the exes, con-
sumed no less than 39.9 p.c. of the income. The
best that can be said is that the figure is much
better than it used to be:—

Nominally, the policies with few exceptions are
under “with-profit” tables; but the total bonus
additions so far amount to only £1356.

In banking more than in most things the fat pig
gets the grease. The little fellow, no matter how
strong he may be for his size, has to battle for his
business: to the big, imposing fellow a steady stream
flows automatically. The ’Asia is one of the big
fellows. When the banking crisis happened 20 years
ago it didn’t have to close its doors, and that gave
it a big lift. Out of the profits it made in those
days it was content to pay a comparatively small
dividend, and used the balance to write down assets
And probably they weren’t a bad lot of asests in the
first place, because during the land boom, the ’Asia
had a general manager who didn’t lose his head—
and then a railway accident cost him his life before
he could see the wisdom of his policy. After that
hard writing down there came a run of good seasons
and high prices, and the bank made a heap of money
by getting rid of securities at prices far in excess
of their wntten-down book values. Out of its gorgeous
profits it started to write down its premises account;
and to-day, though its office nroperties must be
worth close on a million, they stand in the books at
only £40,212, and next year the item will probably
disappear altogether. Even now this means that the
bank has an undisclosed reserve of certainly over
£750,000. Little things like that have naturally
attracted custom —-so much custom that the ’Asia
could afford to turn away any that it had its
doubts about.
Meantime it saw that something would fall pre-
sently, and it kept itself in a position to help those
of its customers who were liable to be hurt if they
didn’t get assistance. Something did fall lately, and
during the year the bank has been able to increase
its advances by no less than £1,332,901 —and the
bank that can' stand by its customers like that in
had times is the bank to make friends, and inci-
dentally profits. The drain on the funds has of
course been considerable. This shows that and a
few other things:—

Premises . . 85,480 40,212 Dee. 45,268
That draw of £758,404 on the liquid assets left the
bank with 35 p.c. of the public’s money represented
by cash and as good as cash. It isn’t a dangerously
low figure; yet the management probably saw that
deposits weren’t likely to grow much, while some
customers were still liable to want help, so an issue
of £400,000 of capital was lately decided on.
The earnings, calculated on capital and visible
reserves combined, are extraordinary:—
Apl., 1908 £l3 4 10 p.c. Oct., 1910 £ll 15 3 p.c.

Apl., 1910 11 12 10 „ Oct., 1912 12 1 9 „
When a bank which doesn’t go in for notoriously
risky business can show a return of that size, it is
as good proof as one can want that the assets are
not overvalued. In fact, it is a pretty large hint
that assets are under-valued and that there is a
considerable internal or contingency reserve stuffed
away somewhere.

Besides that dividend of 5 p.c., payable on May 15,
a bonus of 5 p.c. will, according to present inten-
tions, be payable on July 1. Simultaneously the
first payment of 10s. per share will be due on anew
issue of 200,000 shares at par (£1). The£3so,ooo
of reserves transferred in 1911 brought up the capi-
tal to £700,000. The cash bonus (7£ p.c.) paid
last year was accompanied by the issue of a further
£IOO,OOO of capital at par. That made 800,000
shares; so in July existing holders will be entitled
to one new share for every four old ones, and the
cash bonus will provide 4s. out of every 10s. pay-
able as the first moiety on the new shares. The
second moiety will not be due till January 1, 1914;
nevertheless the new shares will rank equal with the
old ones with respect to the dividend which the
directors have hopes of paying at the end of the
current year. They “anticipate being able to pay
regular moderate dividends,” they say. On past re-
cords, The Bulletin can t accuse them of being un-
duly optimistic,. Asa matter of fact, the past year’s
profit was a shade over 27 p.c. on the actually paid
capital ( £397,500). Still the co. deserves to make
a very fine return on its capital because of the large
sums which it has consistently laid by. In the last
six years in which 8 p.c. was paid to shareholders,
the latter got £138,000, while no less than £160,303
was either put to reserves or written off special
accounts. How much is written off as a general
thing the long-headed management doesn’t mention.
During the last two years the book value of the
shipping asset has moved on from £191,148 to
£211,140, or an increase of less than £20,000;
and the’ Montoro alone cost at least sixpence more
than that. Certainly the Guthrie was sold; but
probably the ancient Guthrie stood at about 4d. in
the books, and what it fetched has been either added
to the disclosed profits or dropped into a stocking
somewhere to prawvide for eonteengencies.
But though the cp. has put a lot of money into
the Java-Singapore shipping business, and has added
the Matarain and Montoro to its fleet for those ser-
vices during the, last Si years, the bulk of its funds
is still apparently in the island trade: —

Liabilities to the public ( £209,508) are no doubt
mainly trading debts. On the other side book debts
represent £340,713. They don’t go in much for
weekly bills and settlements in the islands. Of the
£137,306 shown as cash and investments, £116,930
is represented by “shares and interests in shipping,
insurance and other cos.” The insurance interest is
no doubt in the Queensland, which started as a
branch of 8., P. and Cos., and has made a remarkable
success of things. This paper doesn’t suppose the
co. has written up its original holding; and as the
shares which fcost 10s. in cash are now worth 455.,
there is a pleasant little contingency fund hidden
there, too. Altogether the concern reeks of money.
It did look a while ago as if it was sinking a lot of
capital in big ships for the Java-Singapore trade
which couldn’t give anything like the return the co.
was used to getting from the Pacific Islands trade;
but 8., P. and Cos. arid the Dutch line buried their
hatchet, and with bulging cargoes and a good pas-
senger traffic both ways, that line must be very pro-
fitable nowadays.

Elder, Smith and Cos. have in one form or another
been in business in S. Aus. for 70 years. The co.
is more than an agent; to thousands of country
people it is banker and business guide as well. With
branches all over S. Aus. and in many places in
western N. S. Wales, it has so woven itself into the
commercial lives of so many peoole that, naturallv
enough, it was repeatedly asked by clients to take
charge when the clients became too dead , ,
after things themselves. That was really the i°° k
of this concern; a separate co. was formed „ t ? rt
Elder-Smith’s wing, the old co.’s organisation
put at the disposal of the infant, and a man Th 8

As at March, 1912, it had £168,795 of trust fumlc
in hand ; now, 12 months later, the total !
£525,269. As with the Melbourne and Sydney

average charge p.c. p.a. will, of course, be smaller
There are few cos. that do more for their monev than
the trustee office ; yet the trustee cos.’ profits 'are so
large in proportion to their paid-up capital that it
seems certain they must soon offer still more liberal
terms or larger advantages in some other way This
co. has a paid capital of £20,000, with £BO 000
uncalled. All the capital that was actually needed
in the business was the pound or two necessary to
buy a table and a chair or so ; the balance is earn
ing interest in a public security. The profit from
the business itself is, therefore, all profit; none of
it is reallv interest on capital. Last vear the net
revenue showed over 9 p.c. on capital (interest gave
over 34 p.c. and the business provided 54 p.c.)—a
remarkable record, considering the age of the co
and remembering that most trustee cos. have to wait
for their fr-'ends to die before they can show much
profit. Nevertheless, the co. pays no dividend ■ it
knows, of course, that the trustee takes some risks
though they are not very formidable ones if the man-
agement is good, and it is going to accumulate some
reserves in order to make itself safe. They are a
prudent crowd, and just the solid sort to make a
good thing out of this class of business.

By the grace of Robert Philp, Townsville is the port
for some few hundred thousand square miles of coun-
try lying along the railway line that crawls out
through Charters Towers and Hughenden, past CIOII-
- and on almost to the N.T. border; also, the
harvest of the rich Ayr sugar lands come that wav.
And because Cloncurry has been brisk and the sugar
business has boomed (though it ought to have wilted
and died when T. Tanna went), Townsville has been
growing; also, it has been leaving the gas burning
with a lordly indifference about the bill. Hence the
gain in profit during the last two or three years;
hence, also, the call for new mains, plant, etc. If
the co. had had a more reasonable thirst for divi-
dends, it might have met these latter requirements
out of reserves; but the Northern habit is to collar
money when it is there. Fresh capital has, there-
fore, to be got in ; £25,000 was authorised a fpw
months ago, and all but 2110 shares were taken by
existing shareholders at par. The money will be
used to build new works, presumably to more or
less replace the old works. So far as the works
are to be displaced, they should have been written
down out of past profits ;. and this paper has doubts
whether that has been done to a sufficient extent.
If it hasn’t been done, one lot of works will pre-
sently be struggling to pay dividend on two lots of
capital. The position, nevertheless, isn’t plainly
bad, because depreciation has by no means been
wholly neglected. What, however, is pretty obvious
is that, in view of the big increase in capital—it was
only £15,000 in 1907 and will be £75,000 when
the last payments are made on the present issue—
the past percentage earnings can’t be relied on as a
guide to the future.

The profit is shown after various deductions have
been made on account of depreciation of plant; and
though the two dividends of 2s. each naid during the
last term were not earned, the figures would still be
satisfactory if they could be maintained for another
quarter-century. But there isn’t any hope of that.
The ore in sight is 220,800 tons, and, though a lot
of prospecting has been done, the ore developed in the
past 12 months has been only 31,873 tons, while
the extraction amounted to 94,000 tons. Even if
another 31,873 tons a year can be found, the mill
will have overtaken the supplies in 34 years. It is
very doubtful, though, whether much more ore will
be discovered. The bottom working level is at
1715 ft. ; there is a level at 1815 ft., but no payable
ore has been found there or underneath. Six months
ago the co. had hopes of a western body found on
the Central (Sulphide Corporation’s) boundary; but
exploration has been “for the most part unsuccess-
ful.” Further, costs are high, and as the co. will
have to scratch harder to get out the ore, they are
likely to go still higher. A considerable quantity
of the stuff is in the upper levels, and even if this
can be got out at all the job will be very expensive
owing to the ricketty state of these workings.
There is no reason to expect any success below the
1815 ft. There are lots of reasons for expecting the
opposite.
The net profit last half-year was a shade over 7s
per ton. Assuming that another 300,000 tons can be
got out at the same profit, there will be £105,000
in all available. Add to that the surplus of
liquid assets, £82,000; total, £187,000 = 375. 4d.
per share. The co. has no stored by-products like
most other Broken Hill mines. The richness of
those by-products was really the co.’s misfortune.
Its extraction of silver and lead in the lead mill
was always poor, and the zinc contents were high:
wherefore it was to Block 10 that the treatment
cos. turned for tailings in the early davs of zinc
extraction, when the processes were raw and the
prices poor. Nothing, therefore, is to be added to the
£187,000 on account of stored bv-oroducts. And
whether even £187,000 can be realised denends on
the prices of metals. During the last half-year the

A great mistake, when erecting new works or re-
arranging old ones, is often made in constructing the
building and installing machinery ere looking round
for means of transport of the raw material, half-
manufactured and finished goods. Messrs. Adolf

catalogues and leaflets, illustrating and describing a
few of the many transport systems and plants which
they have supplied, and which show the solution of
the transport question and the advantages of em-
ploying such appliances. W. and J. Lempriere,

In view of the higher level of prices for practically
all commodities —a rise due largely, no doubt, to
the greater abundance of gold and the consequent
cheapening’ of that metal, which is our one medium
of exchange—-the £ll for lead of a few years back
needn t be looked for nowadays. Still, some weak-
ening is highly probable, wherefore the figures
arrived at above, on the basis of last half-year’s re-
sults, may very likely not be realised. Besides the
money that may be got out of the mine and the
liquid assets that have been already accumulated,
there is the plant, of course ; but the scrap value of
mining plant at Broken Hill is not large. And it
is pretty certain that, in a final struggle to keep
alive, the co. will spend a few thousands on fruitless
prospecting. If, then, shareholders get back 375.
4d. per-share they will be lucky.
No other field of recent years ever had so
many enemies who called themselves friends as Ard-
lethan (N.S.W.). It was quite possible for it to pay
fair dividends on a moderate capitalisation to pro-
bably half a dozen cos. The first float, the Car-
pathia, was moderate. After that, they were mostly
outrageous. The rich stuff got on the surface, ab-
solutely no proof of richness at depth, was used to
bait the cruellest hooks that have been thrown to
the public for years past. For 6hows that had no
more connection with Ardlethan than Woolloo-
mooloo has with Darling Point, tens of thousands
were asked and paid to promoters and vendors who
had done nothing beyond hurriedly driving in a few
pegs. The Ardlethan group is in granite or por-
phyry. Scores of the other claims are in schist or
quartzite country. In the most unexpected places
anywhere within 20 miles of Ardlethan, you can
drop on to camps—a tent with a bit of a yard for
the horse. The man inside is a “prospector.” He
doesn't know one thing about prospecting, and he
generally admits it; but he’s “in with a good man
in the city.” The “good man in the city” is busy
looking for fools ; and the crop is good. Nineteen-
twentieths of these claims will never be worked.
There is nothing to work in them.
The daily papers have been terribly to blame.
Following their usual policy, they have allowed any-
one to fill them up with yarns about the field. The
“local correspondents,” of course, knew little of
mining and nothing of tin-mining. They have been
sending along the local gossip—and the local gossip
came always from somebody with something to sell.
And, thanks to the puffing, the sales have been made
all right. A local railway stationmaster has gone
for al2 months’ trip to Europe. A local police-
man has made thousands —the number of thousands
swells as you go along. What sort of a wicket the
local hotelkeeper is on can be imagined. There is
only one of him—with a “coffee palace” to keep
him company.
They have missed no chances, these boomsters.
They have actually had the gall to get photographs
of the wheat stacks printed and placarded as pic-
tures of ore stacks. Certainly, the ore stacks are
growing; and some of the people who are helping
them to grow may be very sorry when they are
shifted. While the stacks are there they can talk
of 30 or 40 p.c. ore. When the stuff is sampled
they will have to shut up. One investigator, who
was wandering round a few days ago, saw a man
busy filling up bags with strippings. An hour later,
the supply of bags having evidently run out, the un-
used strippings were being thrown on to the mullock
heap.
Ardlethan is 3 p.c. rich surface ore, in short
shoots, with, perhaps, a few permanent mines under-
neath ; the other 97 p.c. consists of equal parts of
bovine ignorance and rank swindle.
* * * *
Carpathia’s new manager—Ellis, formerly
of the Conrad —sends in his first report. One re-
mark he makes about the ore body in the No. 4
shaft has been jumped at by the boomsters. “I have
proved this line of lode for fully 100 ft., showing nice
ore, and running in a northerly direction.” “This,”
says one daily paper fluter, “shows that the ore the
No. 4 shaft is on is not a pipe.” Asa matter of
fact, the No. 4 shaft, in the manager’s own words,
“shows an ore body 6Aft. long by 2Aft. in width.”
The lode is on the contact of the porphyry and the
schist, and pipes of ore along its course may be ex-
pected. The fact that ore has been got 100 ft. away
from the shaft needn’t, therefore, surprise anybody.
But it certainly isn’t proof that the ore doesn’t
occur in pipes.
* » * *
The Sydney co. which owns that dread-
ful stringer, Mount David (N.S.W.), has acquired
the Little Marvel mine, and is sinking anew shaft
to a depth of 200 ft. At that level a crosscut will
be run in to the contact of tiie felsite with the
slate, where, of course, it is hoped to find a payable
reef. r ihe Little Marvel gave some good crusnings a
tew years since from old workings, with which it is
intended to connect the new shaft presently, more
for purposes of ventilation than anything else.
Rich quartz discovered in decomposed
sandstone near the surface of the Hawkins’ Hill Re-
ward lease (N.S.W.) has caused a good deal of ex-
citement. But people who get excited about a nar-
row streak, as much as 4in. wide in places, have no
of proportion. The discovery was made near
the Exhibition shaft. Frenchman's reef is also being
opened by the Hawkins’ Hill Reward Cos. A crush-
ing of 80 tons returned 3loz. of gold—which is a
different and, on the whole, a much better story.
A plat has been cut at the 190 ft. level in the Exhi-
bition shaft, and a crosscut will be run in to prove
three different reefs, including the rich vein be-
forementioned.
* * * *
March and April developments added fur-
ther lustre to Meekatharra (W.A.). Higher values
than had ever previously been met with were exposed
at 627 ft. in the Fenian. Ingliston Consols reported
the intersection of a good payable lode at 750 ft. ;
and the Ingliston Extended, which has lately had
more than its share of water and other troubles,
managed to drain the 300 ft. level and sink a winze
27 ft. in ore worth many ounces per ton. Commo-
dore is close to 400 ft., where good values are ex-
pected, and the Kyarra is getting down as fast as
possible to 300 ft. Recent developments in the
higher levels have been quite up to expectations.
And, finally, the March yield fronS the field was a
record.
The substantial rise in Golden ’Shoe shares
is due to improved values in the No. 3 lode at the 13th
and 14th levels. At the former point the ore for
748 ft. south of the main crosscut assayed from 255.
to 325. per ton for the full width of the drive. Then
from 748 ft. to 785 ft. values improved to 85s. per
ton. At 1400 ft. the lode assayed up to 255. per ton
until the drive reached 772 ft. south ; from there to
895 ft. the grade varied from 325. to 425.' Some
weeks ago the manager advised the Board by cable
that from 885 ft. to 1000 ft. the average was 89s. per
ton for 72in., and that the ore in the face assayed
191 s. At the 1500 ft. level the same lode is reported
to have been opened up for 869 ft. south of the main
crosscut, in ore ranging from 255. 6d. to 345. No. 2
lode for the last 110 ft. driven at this level is re-
puted to be worth from 30s. to 80s. In addition to
these developments are those recorded as a result of
work done some time ago on the No. 4 lode from the
adjoining Great Boulder workings. At 2480 ft.,
where the crosscut passed through a portion of a rich
sect ! on of the lode, assavs averaged 1065., but in-
creased to 4765. in the first 10ft. south and to 12755.
m the next sft. At the 2630 ft. level the lode
assayed 106 s. in the crosscut. From 90ft. to 100 ft.
south, values rose to 4255., though they tumbled to
115 s. in the next 13ft. Where tapped at the 2800 ft.
level the lode was 6ft. wide and assayed 104 s. per
ton. These three levels have already been connected
by winzes, and the main shaft is down 2650 ft. All
this makes very pleasant reading; but with heavy
liabilities still to face, and the prospect of a long
wait before dividends are resumed, shares look dear
at present prices.

Oroya Links has taken a short sampling
option on its next-door neighbor, North Boulder. At
one time this show was worked by an English co.,
which, more by good luck than good management,
unearthed a lot of gold and pa : d £27,500 in divi-
dends. Then the main shoot dipped into the Asso-
ciated. A good deal of money was afterwards sunk
in testing other parts of the property, but without
much success, and ultimately the whole outfit was
sold to a local syndicate, which knew a bit more
than the co. about the mine and about where to look
for values. This syndicate has since laid out a fair
sum in plant and development and has d : stributed
£4500 among its members out of gold won. A
hurried sampling of the upper levels will not en-
lighten the Oroya Links much as to the real value
of the property. A much longer option is needed.

Tributes are off at Burbank’s Birthday
Gift (W.A.). Six years ago when things looked a
bit blue, the co. elected to stand aside and let others
have a go. Since then over £BO.OOO has been un-
earthed by parties of working miners, nearly one-
half of it during the past year. Old Professor
Nicholas, who made money for sharehold n rs in the
old days, is again in charge, but from all accounts
there isn’t much left for him to take out. During
the professor’s previous management the mine pro-
duced £537.000 and paid £99.500 in divs. 8.,
M. and Cos. then came along and dug out £70.000
for the co., but no further dividends were earned.

After an inglorious sort of career, Mur-
chison Associated has decided to spend no more
money in W.A., and proposes to try to get back the
heavy losses incurred there by concentrating atten-
tion on its rubber estates in Ceylon. To do this,
however, another £25,000 is said to be wanted, and
an attempt is about to be made to get it out of
shareholders by means of another reconstruction and
a 6d. assessment.
General-manager Magnus, of Mount Mor-
gan, draws less from Many Peaks than his prede-
cessor did. The output for last quarter was 14,630
tons ; gold contents of this flux were 14dwt., and the
copper 1.4 p.c. The output for the corresponding
quarter of 1912 was 22,220 tons. Gold and cooper
contents are about 7s. per ton poorer now than they
used to be. The other shows in the neighborhood
are Glassford Creek and Mount Hector. The former
is still under exemption—it is about the most per-
sistent applicant for exemption in Bananaland. One
lease has had exemption 19 times; but something
should happen soon, as the Minister minuted the last
application “Further and final six months.” Some-
body had a look at Mount Hector the other day, but
that has happened many times before. The Eleanora,
a copper show near Marmor (where Mount Morgan
draws its limestone from), still sends its small
parcels to Mount Morgan for treatment. There is
copper where there is ore; but the ore is mighty thin
at times.

Stanthorpe Tin. Ltd., a sluicing proposi-
tion iust over the Queensland border, has had its
second clean-up. and 33$cwt. of oxide was the har-
vest of 70 hours’ work. On the basis of these two
runs the management reckons it is entitled to do
some figuring. There should be 336 working
hours per month and a total revenue of £1250.
Expenses are put at £3OO. leaving £950 profit per
month for plant duplication, dividends and sundries
—on a paid capital of £II,OOO, in 1100 shares of
£lO each. It is a cheerful prospect; but it can’t
be realised until the co. gets a bigger water supply
than it has at present. And if the co. is certain of
its ground and is dead-sure it can get a water-
supply, it had better hurry along another plant.
There isn’t much sense in leaving tin in the ground
when the market is ready to snap up oxide at £125
or so a ton on the spot. There have been times
within the last 10 years when the tin scratcher has
been glad to take £6O, and those times (or some-
thing like them) may come again. In. fact, for at
least 30 years prior to 1899 there wasn’t a single.
12 months in wnich black tin was worth more than
£65 on the average, and in 1896 metallic tin was
down to £59, or (say) £32 10s. for oxide. These
figures are a dreadful warning to the co. which has
tin in the ground to lose no time in rooting it out.
Low-grade Scottish Gympie (Q.) has
paid £552,367 in dividends since 1895, when it was
purchased from the Eastern Monkland. At the annual
picnic a few days since, the chairman stated that
since the start, 18 years ago, 1,068,954 tons had
been crushed for 448,3910 z., worth £ 1,682,349. The
mine has averaged 31s. 4d. per ton, and at the pre-
sent time working costs and the expenses of manage-
ment run to 17s. 3d. per ton. Still, one mustn’t for-
get that low costs are to some extent due to an un-
stinted expenditure. Mining and treatment plants
have mopped up £97,179. The latest move is to
purchase a tube- mill and cyanide plant, presumably
to treat some of the residues and tailings from the
million tons of stone crushed.
Mt. Oxide (Q.) developments continue to
give every promise that the deal with the big Lon-
don people will be completed. Acting under ad-
vice they went into the business on a six months’
option. They advanced a sum of money, said to be
£20,000, to carry out certain development work,
and if that work was satisfactory they undertook to
pay in all £160,000 for 275,000 shares. The co.
had enough confidence in the mine to be satisfied
that the development would give good results, and
so it is turning out.
The high price of tin is drawing a good
deal of attention to the Annan River fields (N.Q.).
An English syndicate is now interesting itself in a
bucket dredging area in the lower reaches of the An-
nan River. If the values are sufficiently good, it
should be an ideal field, as there is no doubt what-
ever about quantities of dirt and water. Surface
prospecting on beaches has given from lib. to 21b.
to the yard.
One looks for black edges to Cathcart
(Vic.) reports nowadays. Bryant, manager of the
one-time aristocrat of Ararat, fears that most of the
3000 fathoms off the rises is “under-payable.” The
one crumb of comfort he offers is that work north-
east and south-west may put him on the old run of
gold. The actual length of “under-payable gutter”
should be set out, so that one might know how much
to write off the value of the claim. What has upset
the Cathcart applecart is the functioning of the deep
gutter with the channel carrying the payable ground.
This has happened at a point opposite No. 3 shaft.
And it may have meant sweep'ng the gold into the
Central Cathcart section of the lead, enriching that
patch, which the Cathcart aristocrats were too lofty
once upon a time to give a couple of “ponies” for.
Since Golden Pyke, Bendigo, got on to
the dividend list, great things have been expected
of its neighbors, Golden Age and Princess Dagmar;
but the only pirates to annex anything out of either
co. so far have been those who float around the Bee-
h've. At the Golden Age a little ginger in the man-
agement would help ; if that isn’t forthcoming, Prin-
cess Dagmar must beat it in yields in the near
future. This latter company some years ago went
out west from its main shaft at 781 ft., and hit
quartz. As only Ift. of stone was got, and that of no
value, the formation was neglected. Hard times
have driven the Dagmar and other mines to look up
these neglected makes of quartz near the surface.
The experience of Golden Pyke on the same line
now shows that the Dagmar ought to have done a
great deal more poking about at this point. In a
drive of 858 ft. from the Golden Age boundary, Ift.
of good stone is now being carried, with the shoot
widening over the back of the level. The Dagmar
looks to better times when it can handle its stone
better ; and as a big block of this scrip is held out-
side Bendigo, many eyes would be turned towards
the field if long-deferred hope now matures at this
old claim.
Argo Dredging, at Sandy Creek (Vic.),
despite the Svme interest, has not so far been a bon-
anza. Last, half-year the plant churned up 203,000
cubic yards of drift for an average return of only
3id. per cubic yard, and even in the Bright dis-
trict there wouldn’t have been much in that. Still,
the co. has wiped off its overdraft. Now the dredge
has its tail-race over a fresh paddock in a narrower
field of wash, so it is believed that better results
will be got.
* * * *
Cock’s Pioneer (Vic.) passes into the
hands of Robinson, Clark and Cos. and the Baillieus,
who undertake a float. Present capitalisation is
40,000 shares paid to 21s. 9d. In the new co. of
150.000 shares the old co. is to have 33,333 shares
of 20s. ; the underwriters get 50,000 shares at par
and the call over another 50,000 shares at 265., the
call to be open for two years. As the nominal capital
of the new co. is to be £150.000, there remain
nearly 17.000 shares —presumably to serve as com.
to underwriters and agents. Hector Macdonald had
a lot to do with pushing the deal through, and may-
be he gets a bit. Expert reports on the claim were
full of hope ; so instead of going along with a small
plant and few chances, it will have the big plant it
needs. Also, it will have the usual swell accessories
that it could very well do without.
Mount Lyell is at last dragging out ore
from the North Lvell 850 ft. level, and nearly has
the 1000 ft. level cleaned up for the miner. Then,
with the water out of the 1100 ft., the co. will get
go ; ng on the old scale; but the Mines Department
may require a lot done to prevent another disaster,
and the co. itself wants to make itself quite secure
against a second holocaust. The wait for dividends
may, therefore, be longer than the over-sold market
counts on.
* * * *
Briseis (Tas.) has acquired an option
over 255 acres up Mitta Mitta wav (Vic.). Where-
upon all and sundry are notified that a belt of
metamorphic schist, extending 35 miles from Tallan-
doon to Glen Wills, embraces the happy home of the
future Ardlethan of Victoria. Geology Dunn, even
in the face of the awful smash-up of the Glen-Wills
rush, always had hope of the Tallandoon region, but
his idea is that the irregularity of the shoots makes
it a small man’s field. Lindesav Clark mav be
trusted to soon pull out if this is so; for, although
he has lots of stuff at his back, he isn’t fond o-f
chucking it about.
Yields from the Tasmania at Beaconsfield
(Tas.), unless the next level helps out the position,
will stamp the claim as a pumping station more
than anything else. Frechville, the big expert, and
John Taylor, together with the late Billie Jones and
the Hoffnungs, pinned their faith to the gold living
down in the Tasmania, in view of the big returns
got by the old Launceston co. up to the point where
J. Bull bought the claim. Results since then show
that the best of mining engineers can’t look 100 ft.
into the ground. To lift the clouds a little float is
being put out in London —-the Delamere and Tas-
mania Development Cos., Ltd. This innocent is *to
pick up a block of 4428 acres, owned about equally
by the Tasmania Cos. and the executors of the dead
George Lambert. The land is to be transferred to
the new co. for (roughly) £3 10s. per acre, or
£16,650 in all. Asa start, the new co. is to spend
up to £BOOO in clearing roads and in demonstration
orchard work. Some Tamar fruit land is selling for
four times the money, and the tendency is still up-
wards, so the prospects are by no means vile.
The Radium Hill Cos. sends a parcel of
radium to England through the Bank of North
Queensland, so apparently buyers are not rushing
things. A parcel "from Woolwich, tested at Sydney
University, gave an indefinite result, for after the
test was made it was stated that the radium re-
quired further time to mature. The stuff being the
highest priced on earth, buyers may be excused for
being particular about purity. The whole process
is painfully slow. Compared with the reserves in
the mine (Olary, S.A.), the output and milling of
16 tons of ore per fortnight seems absurd. ' r he
cheeriest news is that a parallel 6in. vein, contain
ing a better percentage of carnotite or uranium, has
been discovered.
Investor: Costs, extraction and value of
product are all so uncertain that the radium business
is still a gamble, not an investment.....!. Mcl.:
There has been a hitch over the Mount Oxide’s Lon-
don business; but this paper believes it will go
through all right.

THE PRAYER OF THE PROMOTER.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
We do not want a boom.— Too-much-protesting
Ardlethan director.
Best for our true development
Is water drawn from main or pump;
Champagne’s a curse by devils sent,
And our most dear desire’s a slump,
For, oh! how like to gods grow we
If cradled in adversity 1
We sink in iron and porphyry,
In quartz vein and in granite rock,
And hope the ore will not be free,
For easy money is a shock;
For low-grade stuff we make our prayer
And hope that arsenic will be there.
Twenty per cent, tin goes not down ;
But poverty is best for us —
Each tin-shoot with an iron crown
Shall soon be very pyritous.
O’er the rich ores black hell may loom,
So, Lord! we pray, send not a boom.
The quartzy shows in granite may
Cut out in fifty feet or so,
But better, Lord! to walk Thy way
And poor and righteous daily grow.
Send us a slump chock-full of doom —
But, O Lord! keep from us a boom !

A
WOMAN’S
LETTER
Sydney, May 5, 1913,
My Dear Arini, —
Hospital Saturday fund, in spite of being
nearly squeezed to death by 20,000 cadets on
the march, climbed up to the respectable
total of £BOOO odd. The Bank of N.S.W.
clerking staff deserve a bouquet for obliter-
ating their Saturday half-holiday for the
Cause. Instead of skipping round a tennis
court, Algernon Beau-Suburbs, nobly stuck
to his desk and his office coat. He toiled to
chase the uttermost farthing to its bleak
home in a bank vault, till the midnight cat
meowed on the city roof. As Algernon of
the New South not only gives his services on
Hospital Saturday, but gives them with a
cheery grin, he is a mighty good citizen.
Mrs. Jack Cormack fed a section of the
hungry box-ratttlers on Hospital Saturday,
from 11 to 12 noon. A small niche was
walled off in the N.S.W. Tourist office for
this worthy cause. Mrs. C. D. Patterson
lent her aid. Violet Lorraine, a smart young
Puss, in a fur toque and smoke-grey gown, was
located in the stand outside the Tourist lair.
The crowd, which expected to see Lily Bray-
ton on this patch of pavement, walked over
its neighbor’s corns with enthusiasm. In
its struggle to poke its inquiring individual
nose into the small calico reserve that was
to have sheltered the Lily’s head, it became
too demoralised to resist the insistent cry,
“Give ! Give !”
The daughters of the horse-leech were mendi-
cants of no account, compared to a Sydney
girl when she fights for a copper on Hospital
Saturday. Cleopatra Asche had sent along
a ten-pound note instead of her presence.
But the man in the street, not Knowing this,
fell into the arms of a horde of collecting
angels, who wheedled him out of everything
but his wearing annarel, while he searched
for the Brayton millinery.
Mrs. R. B. Sheridan and the muscular Ivy
Schilling, guarded by a vast bulldog, with a
pensive smile, camped at the Australia stand
during last Saturday’s scramble for coin.
The Dog, as a polite negation, does good ser-
vice on Hospital Day, and a St. Bernard,
about the size of a small pony, lay in wait for
cash near the Commercial Travellers’ Club.
„ lightning sketch appearance of the
Gov.-General in Sydney on Saturday, was
garnished with the cheers of the multitude
and the inevitable jog-trot of the under-
taker’s horse. Aldermen, as part of the
city’s welcome to the rich exile from Yarra’s
far shore, were seated, in chariots that
looked suspiciously like mourning coaches.
The serious attitude of the horses suggested
that, if they don’t belong to the cemetery
trade, they ought to. His small Ex., pink
cheeked, with the suppressed excitement of a
schoolboy who has crept over the wall into
a forbidden apple orchard, motored through
the streets with the large Gaud Mayor
Cocks.
The Welcome Home bunting that wriggled
overhead was good in spots—like the pro-
cession. A queer conglomeration of small
toy flags, a motor or two, a hired taxi or so,
a few mourning coaches, and some uniforms,
pulled up in front of the Union Club. Half
a dozen members, with their hair nicely
greased, hung over the entrance as the G.G.,
almost buried beside the portly form of the
City Father, hurried out of a car and scam-
pered up to the Club citadel. Later on,
G.-G. Denman, clothed in the burnished radi-
ance of a cocked hat and gorgeous militarv
trappings, received the salute of 20,000
boys in khaki at the gates of the
Lown Hall. How to keep on bobbing
to the vociferous welcome of the crowd, with-
out nodding the glory of the cocked hat into
the gutter, was the G.-G.’s most intricate
military evolution on Cadet Daw The
lengthy Polo Burnham, also decked in his
Sunday best; Polo Nutting and A.D.C.
Barttelot shadowed the Denman flight to and
from Sydney.
iHi’. Arthur Guise is the G.-G.’s new secre-
tary, now nearing Australia in the Morea.
The boys in khaki showed various grades
of drill in their tramp through the city, pre-
sumably according to the length of time
theyve been under healthy discipline. On
the pavements a panting, struggling crowd
tried to pick out its own mother’s darling,
as the long khaki stream of Boy trickled
slowly through the streets. A riotous baby,
trying to chew off a floral decoration in an
adjacent hat, got a fine maternal reproof.
‘My word, I’ll be glad when you’re old
enough for compulsory.” From infantine
groups perched on window sills, shrill treble
cheers greeted Billy and Tommy as they
dug their heels into macadam.
“A Stranger” writes :
Re Kurnell celebration, it seemed to me, as a pil-
grim who has brought his camel and h>'s tent into
your city, that the absence of school children was
a conspicuous blunder on the part of the authorities.
The speech of the Minister for Education teemed
with the possibilities that history opened up to the
Young Idea. Here was the very opportunity. Two
or three schools, at least, mwht have contributed
their senior pupils to the Cook memorial dav. Chief
Justice Cullen’s short address was the most inspirit-
ing thing I have heard for many a day. It ought to
have kindled the fire of patriotism in the breast of
a red-ragger. I left Kurnell under the impression
that the whole affair was purely a society function
arranged for the purpose of giving the park trustees’
wives and their friends an opportunity to hobnob
with the Governor, the Admiral and other person-
ages.
The Automobile Club showed its respect-
ful admiration for female nerve by handing
Hypatia Monk, a special trophy the other
day. Though the daring Hyoatia had been
politely wet-blanketed when she first men-
tioned her desire to take part in the inter-
state motor race, club members stepped off
their exclusive, rubber-tyred track to heartily
congratulate the only lady motorist on not
getting in front of male competitors. That’s
what the souvenir amounted to, I imagine.
The Fine Arts Society, in Bligh-street, has
taken £l6OO in 16 months. This is a toler-
able record for an infant which hopes to cut
more cash when it feels its feet. The strenu-
ous Julian Ashton is now boss manager. He
does it in his spare time, and has already
managed to extract extensive ' promises of
support out of 20 or 30 leading citizens,
even as old Plantagenet kings used to draw
the teeth of leading Abrahams and Isaacs.
The “Fine Arts” was founded by a num-
ber of artists, backed up by hard cash from
financial admirers. It aims at the useful
work done by the centenarian Fine Arts
Society in London. It charges the person
who sends his brush work 20 per cent, on
sales—a substantial drop from the average
dealer’s percentage. But 20 per cent, has
left a small dribble of loss out of £l6OO
worth of commerce. As the Society has no
intention of going out of business, it means
to broaden its field of operations. Hand-
made lingerie, elegant trifles in point-lace,
old silver, bronzes, opera-coats just landed
from China, and some hand-painted crockery-
ware that would turn the head of a collector,
are now on view. William Cullen, Chief
Justice, and his gentle dame, were amongst
the first to respond to the Ashton appeal for
help.
“The Women’s Handicrafts” will have to
shake itself together and kick itself violently
on the shins, and wake up generally, if it
wants to remain above ground. Signs of
its funeral are not many billions of miles
distant, and it looks as if it might expire
almost any aeon. In its upper chamber (op-
posite Paling’s, in George-street), the Soci-
ety shows internal evidence of a lingering
perish. Its standard of work is insignifi-
cant. Some of its exhibits, on sale at fairly
large prices, ought to be chopped up to boil
the kettle, or relegated to a second-hand
curiosity shop. It has some good stuff,
notably needlecraft and leather work, jumbled
up, the space being limited, with rubbish.
The Women’s Handicrafts suffers, from the
lack of a hanging committee, which would
not only throw out inferior stuff, but threa-
ten to hang the perpetrators of some of the
livery-looking “art” it finds so hard to sell.
An ingenious bed-cabinet model is .its star
exhibit just now. It is the invention of a
Victorian woman, Mrs. Anderson. As a
combination of bed, wardrobe, settee, and
office bureau, it is the last word in saving
space. By pressing the wrong button, I
imagine, it would be. quite possible to sud-
denly hang yourself in the wardrobe till a
good hard kick turned the dress hooks into
the hinges of a writing table, and you found
yourself writing letters to the editor re the
uncertain habits of modern furniture.
Syd Ure Smith, black and white illustra-
tor, hurried into a private hospital last
week. An appendix that he considers super-
fluous luggage was the cause.
Lieutenant Seton, R.N., who flag-lieuten-
anted in so agreeable a manner at blue-
water frivols, is convalescing from a recent
operation. His Best Girl, Miss Joan Deck,
is the daughter of a medico of that name.
The Deck family run to medical and mis-
sionary enthusiasm, and have some mun-
dane interests in tropic isles and copra. The
Seton homestead is in the Land of Kilts
and brose and haggis.
Dr. Thorold Quaife, now in the quaky
region of Panama, writes a Sydney chum, re
that hive of colored industry: “The hotel
I’m located at is a huge wooden structure.
All its doors and windows are covered with
wire. Colored servants and streams of
tourists are its leading features. It over-
looks the town of Panama—a place of nar-
row streets. The resident population is
mostly poor and oarti-colored, dresses itself
in gorgeous hues and lives in the open.
There are some prettv squares grown with
palms, and some quaint old Spanish churches,
South American bands (very fine) and
a good cafe contribute to the life of the
place. On Sunday nights the cafe .is
thronged with visitors in gay Parisian
dresses. The band discourses grand opera
inside, while outside in the streets one
hears the honk of motors and the clang of
bicycle bells that are hung on the queer old
carriages. And just across the way, per-
haps, naked children play in the gutter.
Panama is a place of weird contrasts.”
Australian-born Justine Kong Sing sends
a line from Amsterdam. Sydney’s youthful
artist Justine has been pushing her easel
alongside Dutch caps, and sketching canals
in their wettest streaks. With Hetty
Dymoek she shoulders her paint-box for
Brussels. Later on, the N.S.W. girls loiter
under the shadow of Bruges’ belfry “old and
brown.”
Artists Griiner and Harley Griffiths are
shivering on Canberra plains. With heroic
fortitude they have planked down their
easels in the teeth of the wintry blast that
howls round the ears of the rabbit popula-
tion. and threatens to blow off its million
tails. Griffiths is going to cover a large
canvas with his impressions of the local
burrows, and other outstanding features of
the Federal city. Bunny, meanwhile, is
said to have retreated to his uttermost wind-
proof hole, while Griiner dashes off a few
sketches of the purple hills.
Journalist Alice Schalek, the bright-eyed
Viennese traveller, is picking up solid slabs
of information on Australasian affairs, for
one or two Continental papers. The Frank-
furter Zeitung, to which she is a regular
contributor, is apparently the voice of a con-
servative political party which admits no
radical sentiments in its Tory columns. The
haughty, high-class Austrian’s brain-pan is
over-polished. Result, a carping, hyper-
sensitive critic. He takes his newspaper,
not as a hasty consensus of local news, but
as a serious literary effort. “If I did not
re-write most carefully each article, choos-
ing the most exact word to express what I
mean—then i should get letters to reprove
me, from the public. They care not for the
football match, as in your country,” says
the informative Alice Schalek. “They want
information —oh, yes—but on the affairs and
politics of other countries.” Briefly, Alice
Schalek has to be a mixture of journalist
and Macaulay, junior, rounding up her sen-
tences to suit the fastidious ultra-cultured
Austrian taste. Like the Germans, her
readers love their literature long, not
chopped up short in tabloids as in Aus-
tralia. In N.S.W. the scenic attractions of
the Blue Mountains, and the glory of Syd-
ney’s water-front, have made a deep imprint
on the Austrian lady’s notebook. She is an
ardent patriot. Any reference to the Monte-
negrins and Skutari, in her presence, should
be made bv large, healthy persons, able to
defend their oninions.
The John Robertson memorial fund stamps
on the public imagination with the measured
step of an aged tortoise. Politicians are
soon forgotten, while performing fleas and
acrobats are long remembered. John Robert-
son fought for the right of the poor man to
free-select the soil. The fund, which has
only crawled up to the vicinity of
£340, is intended for the benefit of five
or six afflicted grand-children of the late
John. They are deaf and dumb. The
chance to help the good cause will not cease
till May 31. So the up-country selector
has still time to rush to the aid of the
descendants of the man who was his first
friend. Francis Suttor, M.L.C., and Aider-
man Clarke are hon. treasurers.
Pretty Kathleen Broughton, an Armidale
girl, was married to Norman Dangar the
other afternoon. The wedding was shorn of
the usual fashionable frills, owing to the
recent death of wealthy A. A. Dangar, the
groom’s father. Muriel Broughton, the onlv
bridesmaiden, attended to the correct flutter
of the bridal veil before the small nrocession
moved up St. Philip’s ancient aisle for the
great “I will.” R. M. Bell best-manned the
ceremony.
Tradition used to say, in its old, toothless
fashion, that Bathurst was mostly peopled
with Lees, Suttors, Bassetts and McPhil-
lamys, also fat stock and lean boundary-
riders. The town has grown up into a city
since then, and keeps a bishop and many
other luxuries. But the Suttor family shows
no signs of being wiped off the local map by
the influx of new blood. And the McPhil-
lamys still ride or drive the best horses in
the district, when they don’t fill the scenery
with whiffs of petrol. Kitty McPliillamy,
one of the finest amateur horsewomen in
N.S.W., a daughter of Bob McPhillamy, was
married to Claude Suttor in Bathurst, last
week. The groom belongs to the Brucedale
clan. Liberal helpings from both primeval
families munched the wedding cake.
Zara Wolinski and her brother. Artist .Toe,
were still on the trail of a London studio
when the last mail left the Bull Archipelago.
Mrs. G. P. Bowman, who passed out at
Elizabeth Bay the other day, was a native
of Singleton, which grows Oldest Inhabitants
in prolific crops. The veteran, who had
reached her 80th milestone, was a daughter
of a pioneer named Thomas McDouall.
Mrs. Acheson unnacked her cabin trunk
a week or two ago, and concelled her nassage
in the Orsova. She is a member of the
well-known Plunkett family, and has a stack
of affairs to wind up before she strikes new
roots in England. Her only chick, the
youthful goes with her Staff-
Surgeon. R.N., to Britain’s misty shores,
as previously arranged, on May 10.
Miss Marjorie Nott, a daughter of the
Bowral Randolph Notts, was married to Mr.
Ted Giblin the other evening. Strathfield, a
suburb which resounds with the tinkle of
tea-cups on first and fourteenth Thursdays,
and is primed with “At Homes” on every
day but washing day. was the scene of the
Giblin-Nott wedding bells. The good-
looking Marcia Ross, with Phyllis Ford and
Janet Fell, were the bridesmaidens who
waited on the usual Limerick lace bridal
finery.
The huge Canadian liner Niagara carried
off a big passenger list of Australians bound
tor the other side. Eye-surgeon Roland
I ope. and the A. R. Minters '''off for a
years tour), were included in the Svdnev
list.
Grace Watson writes from the \in,.nK „ i
of a London fog, to sav she has been W,?'

Hodges benefactor, the brisk Australhn
woman found medieval ignorance regarK
this sunny land. In one district, the local
scenery was gummed all over with “W i,

showed a gang of bushrangers holding un

“Captain Cook’s childhood” is the name of
the latest historic bone. It is in the act of
being picked bv Larson Ord Todd and James
H. Watson. The parson is a relative several
times removed of the Dame Walker who is
alleged to have spanked or coaxed the alpha
bet into the juvenile Cook. The bones of
the navigator’s youth are likelv to be picked
as bare as the skulls that line the caravan
route in the sands of Sahara, before the
social status of the very dead Mrs. Walker
is finally half-soled and heeled. The recent
Kurnell frolic is the cause of the Dame’s

Bert Bailey has put on the outer shell
of “Dad” in “On our Selection.” He is
Dad. “Mum” (Alfreda Bevan) looks so
kind and comforting when she gets into a
red flannelette gown that you’d like to bor-
row her .for rheumatism, heartache, or a bad
corn —she’d probably cure the lot.
Steele Rudd’s best book, “On Our Selec-
tion,” has been better dramatised than any
other Australian story. Therefore, the
Palace Theatre is redolent of the smell of
gum leaves just now. “Standing room
only” is its prevailing complaint, a gilt-
edged proof that the public swallows re-
peated doses of a dashing Australian play,
in which the situations are strong and racy
of the soil. The massive chin of George
Treloar pushes its owner along a career of
unsuccessful crime as a stage villain, and
he gets home earlier than the rest of the
company in consequence. As Jim Carey
his murder is arranged for in the second act.
Sarah Rudd, as played by clever Laura
Roberts, in rags ( Act 1), or in large red
hair bows and a flamboyant party dress
(Act 4) is Sarah of the author’s spirited
sketch. She makes the genuine Cornstalk

a vista of gum trees silhouetted against a
sapphire sky.
The man whose, chief job is to groom the
Wild Cat tells me’this: —
. Every time I go to Jenolan I come back sadder,
and I’m so sad this time that 1 don't think I’ll go
any more. When the tourist blows into the N S.W.
Government Bureau the first thing he is told he
ought to do, after inspecting the Harbor, is to rail
up to the Blue Mountains and take a motor to the
Caves. It is good advice, for the Blue Mountains
can show about as much gorgeous color as any other
disarranged landscape in the world, and the 30-odd
miles from Mount Victoria are 30-odd miles of pure
delight. But then you strike the State-run Caves
House —the only place of accommodation—and the
delight begins to fray at the edges and sag in the
middle. It is about the most comfortless shack this
side of Booligal; and beyond Booligal they generally
give you more attention. It is cold at jenolan, as
a rule; but they are liable to drop you into a bed-
room carpeted with icy linoleum and nothing else.
There’ll be gas laid on, but it won’t be usable. The
windows will be curtainless. There’ll probably be
a cha ; r in the room, but it will have lost one leg
and have gout in another. And if you don’t eat
the candles you will as likely as not leave hungry.
All the while the gibe of the man who told you that
“Private Enterprise can do it better ” is blistering
your ear, and making you want to kick somebody
right up to the Dog-star. And things are not much
better in the Caves. Where there isn't muddle there
is mostly ignorance. You are instructed to stick to
the guide with whom you started the round of in-
spection But if you do you’ll presently find that,
the _ parties being limited, you’ll be sent where you
don't want to go, and then you’ll discover that you
could have gone where you wanted to go if you had
thrown the official advice into a cavern and changed
over to some other guide. And those guides! There
are one or two who know' something of their job,
but there are other dreadful humorists who butcher
every rule of grammar for two hours twice a day.
and can tell you nothing more valuable than that
if you look straight ahead you will see a “remark-
able representation” of a sheep’s pluck. The “re-
markable representations” of animals’ innards and
German sausages become' wearisome after the 303rd
infliction. One can’t n°rhaps expect that scientists
will take on the guides’ job, though manv a scien-
tist gets poorer pay; but surely the visitor snared
by the Tourist Bureau might expect something more
solid than the constant drip of information that if
he looks ahead of him he will see a remarkable re-
presentation of a pork ebon. The only comfort is
that as often as not it looks just as much like a
bishop.

“ Chandler of Corraling'a,”
by R. J. CASSIDY.
Here, for the first time in the annals of Australian literature, the thrilling, pulsating excite-
ment of a big shearing-shed has been incorporated into a stirring story. The manner in which
Jack Chandler, a “gun" shearer, rung “Mulgawirra,” and took his own and his rival’s cheque, is,
as The Bulletin says, “graphically and tensely told.” The roar of machinery, the whirring of
the wheels, the flash of the flying cutters and the stress and strain of the terrible ordeal are all there.
And running through this remorseless saturnalia of enduring human toil is a woman’s love, and a
strong man’s way of winning it. It is a strenuous and a striking story—one never told before,
and one not easily forgotten.
“BILL’S IDLES

by A. Q. STEPHENS
(“ The Bookfellow ”).
Fully Illustrated. PRICE, 1/-; POST FREE, 1/1.
In “BILL’S IDEES” the N.S.W. Bookstall Co., Ltd., has the pleasure of introducing Mr.
A. G. Stephens as a new Australian humorist. Mr. Stephens’s reputation as the doyen of
Australasian is widespread, and he has several books of prose and verse to his credit.
“Bill’s Idees” is the first book in which he has given his natural humor free play—as we venture
to think, with the happiest results.
Many years ago the original of “Bill” was a larrikin in Sydney—the leader of a “push.” He
reformed himself, and for a long time has been a highly-respected citizen ; as he says, improving
his mind, cultivating his good instincts, and trying to live up to his ideal. Bill’s ideal is “a
quiet blolce with a quiet wife and a quiet dog with a quiet name.” Bill had had to struggle to
reach his ideal, because he had a lot of bad instincts to get rid of, and because he never had much
chance in the way of education. Still, with the help of his favorite author, Vere Foster, he is
getting along nicely.
Bill’s story is told in his own words. He is interesting when he looks back upon his
unregenerate past, and is no less interesting when he contemplates his reformed present. Hard
life has taught him a philosophy of his own, worth considering. His native humor is of the kind
called “pawky,” and he enjoys a joke against himself. Bill isn’t a fool and he isn’t a clown;
perhaps his readers will seldom laugh right out. But they will get a few broad grins and a
whole heap of chuckles.
Bill's “missus” is several chapters to herself.

The Biggest Money-Maker
for Progressive Hotelkeepers
EVERY Hotelkeeper who is “out to make money” should invest in a Nelson
“Banker” Carbonating Machine. This Carbonator has no limit to its
money-making capacity. It is the best sleeping partner you can have. It
puts money into YOUR hands—money that now goes to the manufacturer, and is
a big item, too. It will make for £4 what costs £2O from the manufacturers. This
is no idle boast and we’ll PROVE it to you.
As to the quality of the machine, we need only say that most of the leading
and successful hotelkeepers in Australia prefer them to any other make ever
invented. The “Banker” beats them all. The materials are the finest in the
world, and they are put together by experts. The “Banker” lasts a lifetime —is
remarkably easv to handle, and never gets out of order, yet it costs no more than
inferior kinds, due to its enormous sale.
The “BANKER” is the Standard Machine.

MELBOURNE CHATTER.
Melbourne, May 5, 1913.
My Dear Yarrie, —
The hop season promises well. Cards for
the St. Kilda Bachelors’ Ball are out, the
festive creatures having arranged to give the
girls a treat at St. Kilda Town Hall on
June 13. Twelve nights later the Vic. Art-
ists’ Society will hold the annual mask <md
costume frivol at Melbourne Town Hall.
Last year the range in bizarre disguises was
restricted to a certain historic period. This
time any properly picturesque age may be
represented. Prehistoric outfits will be
barred, of course ; but early Roman legs and
ancient Egyptian ditto will meet require-
ments.
The Australian Art Association, which is
practically the cream skimmed from the poor
old V.A.S. milk, is now having its first ex-
hibition of pictures at the Athenaeum Gal-
lery. The A.A.A. is a combination of Har-
court, Mather, McClintock, McCubbin,
Meldrum, Officer, Patterson and Withers.
Their show was to be opened yesterday
(Wednesday) by Lady Denman, and will
remain hanging until May 30.
The Fred Alcock family lately wrenched
themselves from their billiard tables, and
steamed off in the Malwa for a scamper
abroad. England and Europe are to be
“done” within seven months, while America
will be glanced at on the way home.
The Melbourne Shakspeare Society cele-
brated poor, dear William’s birthday recently
at the Masonic Hall. The menu for the
evening was a cold hash of “Twelfth Night”
at 2s. a brain. The job took so long that presi-
dent Archibald Strong, at a late hour,
stopped the impatient shifting of chair legs
by the suffering survivors with the intima-
tion that the proceedings would conclude
with the Clown’s song after the third act.
This cut out poor Sebastian’s only scene and
all the fat of the minor roles. It was hard
luck for the people who intended to do the
jobs, but the audience would have risen and
tramped out of the place if some concession
of the sort had not been made. Hired cos-
tumes were eked out with flannel dusters and
other curious remnants. Reciter Charlotte
Hemming, as directress, was assisted by
Frank Russell, secretary of the society. He
also wrestled with the part of Malvolio.
Charlotte stood in the wings holding (1) a
household edition of “the Works,” (2) a
candle, (3) the strings of the curtain, and
(4) her breath. The curtain jibbed badly
after the riotous revels of Sir Toby (in brown
paper boots and very husky), and Sir Andrew
Aguecheek (verv nervous about the stock-
ings). Andrew kept on capering in hopes
that the curtain wmuld be dragged down;
but the curtain remained aloft, and the
panic-stricken actor finally had to leap out
of sight behind a piece of scenery. Viola
wore bunchv petticoats and strutted. She
seemed to be intent on diverting attention
from her grey stockings. The Duke suffered
somewhat from lockjaw; there also appeared
to be something wrong with his back. As
the audience was scuttling towards the doors
the bouquets were hurriedly bundled together
and the coy she-mummers pushed forcibly on
to the stage to take delivery of their re-
wards. Malvolio helped in the scramble.
The rest of the company refused to appear
and bow to the back hair and coat-tails of
the dwindling crowd.
Joseph McCabe is telling scientific secrets
every night, at the Athenaeum Hall. Bald
heads, partly bald heads, corrugated fore-
heads and flashing spectacles occupy most of
the seats. Everybody present is determined
to improve his or her mind —or the mind of
some docile young person in the next chair.
Joseph, a wiry little man with a stubborn
jaw, stands beside a large sheet that looks
as if it had been used in at least one spring
cleaning. Then the lights go out, and the
pleasant voice of Joseph is heard retailing
immense facts about the millions of years
that have floated past like clouds. Listening
to him makes you feel as young as yesterday
morning. I’m sure science must be good for
the complexion.
Rumor asserts that Louis Esson, poet and
dramatist, is booked for matrimony with a
nice Melbourne girl. Rumor is sometimes a
bit previous ; but she is generally worth lis-
tening to with at least one ear.
The University Graduates’ Association in-
duced Canadian Minister G. E. Foster to lec-
ture .on “Ourselves and the Empire,” at the
Masonic Hall, last Friday evening. Invita-
tion cards were fired at citizens through the
post, and the place was crammed to the roof
with Imperialists, all of them bursting with
loyalty. John Madden, who should have
chaired the . show —or blow —was not well
enough to attend; so Vice-Chancellor Mac-
farland did the welcoming act. The plat-
form was furnished with pink screens and
graduates. Alfred Deakin, Norton Grim-
wade, and A.N.A. President Phillips were
also on view. The lecturer proved to be a
narrow, grey man with a broad, red view, and
when he got fairly going he set fire to the
house. Some of the womenfolk were dressed
as if for morning shopping; others were at-'
tired for an evening function. But, thoueh
the dressing was uncertain, there was no
mistake about the enthusiasm. The Empire
is not going to fall yet awhile.
Mrs. Ted Bage has tired of running a home
for an absent family, and is preparing to
steam off to Japan, at the end of this month.
As her son is sampling the Antarctic climate
with Mawson, and the eldest girl is sunning
herself at Brisbane, daughter Ethel, who has
only been back about ten minutes or so after
an extended trip, has been instructed to re-
pack her trunks and accompany mother. The
Japanese trip has become a fad with local
womenfolk. One lately confessed that her
curiosity had oeen aroused by hints thrown
out by a returned husband. She is now wan-
dering through Japan seeing some of the
sights for herself, and wondering about the
other things that she can’t see.
The Barttelots, who boarded with the
Hunter-Landales, in the Deniliquin district,
during the local horse revels, have been going
in for lots of exercise. Long, breezy hours
spent tramping over the links, or leaping on
the tennis courts, were mere preliminaries to
the nightly dances. This week-end the two
are expected back at their suburban cot, for
the Help is due to resume his official job at
the vice-regal establishment. Heaven alone
knows what would happen to the bleeding
country if a Help didn’t come on duty at the
exact minute.
Amongst the Salonites, at Mrs. Bill Wil-
son’s musical tea, was Mrs. Taverner, an old
member or Salonitic. She was towed in and
out of the place by the adopted infant, evi-
dently an impetuous child with the strength
of an ocean tug. The Taverners have defi-
nitely decided to return to London in June.
“I could be happy in Victoria, but John has
got used to the people there and misses them,
so we are going back,” remarked John’s
thoughtful wife. At the Taverner elbow sat
Mrs. McEw-an, who is looking after brother
Fisher, from Maoriland. Their trouble has
been to find time and room for the hospitali-
ties and refreshments that have been thrust
upon them. Both brother and sister were
bidden to lunch this week with the Denmans.
They will indulge in a return spread at the
Oriental before making back.
Amongst the approaching marriages is
that of a dashing widower, something oyer
three score and ten, with an attractive
widow- who has long been regarded as a
family friend. His children are said to be
somewhat upset over Father’s decision. The
role —as actors would say—of every man’s
children is to be mostly angry with Dad and
quite pleased with themselves.
Madge Temple, the vaudeville fashion
plater, gave a tea, this week, to. a selected
company at the Vienna. Madge, oh the boards,
is Mrs. Dereweski, and her husband, who
travels with her, manufactures the touching
little songs she carols. He lived next door to
Paderewski, sen., in Poland, and the illus-
trious pianist’s son and he used to play to-
gether as boys. Any man who has played
with Pad. should be able to write Madge’s
songs.
The Norton Grimwades’ festivity was a
public manifestation of delight at recovering
son Fred, after a two-years’ absence in Eng-
land. Nephew Cedric Battle (who has since
left for London, intent on becoming as “pol-
ished” as his returned cousin) also took a
modest helping of limelight. Homeden is
rather celebrated for its revels, for the
Hodges used to make the board groan there,
and the present owners keep up the toothsome
tradition. Mrs. Norman floated round in
chiffon and lace. A tall red osprey and a
sunburst advertised themselves in her hair.
Mrs. Alf Treacy sported a tunic of gold tis-
sue over melon pink. Bessie Tobin looked
smart in a lemon frock touched with black.
Herbert Sargood chaperoned a blue-clad
wife, and sister-in-law Young; but Norman
Brookes just brought himself. Sydney Dal-
rymple was in care of his sister. Mrs.
Teece (once Freda Grimw-ade) was a study
in lavender. Miss Keats and Lesly Madden
bravely inhabited pannier frocks. The tall
Clarke sisters were amongst the steppers.
The event of the event was supper, which
was served in the dining-room. All the
Grimwadean solid silver glittered on one
long board. The envious looks of the female
guests must have been intensely gratifying
to the energetic hostess. In such cases,
looks are much more than words.
The Warraw-ee Club “At Home” was made
up to suit all tastes. The large room up-
stairs was reserved for dancers, and a musi-
cal programme supplied by Brooks-Smith,
Lottie Williams and others was thrown in,
while card-players glued their attention to
Bridge in a special reserve. President
Staughton, in an inky robe glittering with
jet, triumphantly announced to friends that
the hospitality committee had decided to
entertain Mrs. Taverner on the 16th. Victor
Busst’s mamma stuck (I don’t mean that
she adhered) to her expensive ermine wrap-
pings. Mrs. Secretary Phillips staggered
under a load of art jet. Amongst the dan-
cers were Dr. Grey-Gross and small Anne
Stutt. Nellie Holson w-as also on the scene.
She has lost her limelight ambitions since
her spell of sickness, and has decided to cul-
tivate a voice. (Some people do this as
casually as the suburbanite starts out to
cultivate cabbages.) Nellie was Lily Bray-
ton’s understudy during the Melbourne sea-
son ; but, when the co. went on tour, she fell
ill. and had to retire.
The King’s Warehouse, which uprears
itself in the vicinity of the Australian
Wharf, was invaded on Thursday afternoon
by a curious company anxious to see the
stamping ceremony of the first Federal note
issue. Secretary Collins and Printer Harri-
son soon got busy and showed the guests
how to make paper money. One machine on
the premises turns out tenners at the rate
of £4O per crash. Other machines add the
beautiful carroty-blue color, whilst a ready-
to wear aspect is imparted to 50 notes at a
time by a cute stamper which saves the hand-
trimming process undergone bv the Yankee
greenback. The G.-G. came on from Maori-
land Fisher’s luncheon. His small family
followed him lovingly with wide-open eves.
Sir Alf Vincent (no relation of the black-
and-white artist) made one of the party,
and wore his well-groomed whiskers with dis-
tinction. Help Burnham posed wearily in
the background. Prime Minister Fisher,
showing signs of weariness, jerked out a
few words of welcome. Then little Judith
Denman, who had been chosen to number the
first ten-shilling note, got to work at the
job. His Ex. and small son Thomas added
two more to the issue. The presentation of
souvenirs excited the watching crowd, and the
Treasury had to close down in haste lest the
gold reserve should be imperilled. Westra-
lian Premier Scaddan looked in on his way
home and chatted awhile with the Gaud
Mayor. Plump Mrs. Mills came along with
the members of the Dominions Commission,
and the Haggard laugh (a unique sort of
cackle) was heard above the clatter of
tongues and machinery. Mrs. Andrew
Fisher, despite a recent long train journey,
showed a fresh exterior. Mrs. Pearce was
close at hand, and Mrs. Hughes, greatly
improved in health, hovered around grace-
fully. The Findley couple, the Josiah
Thomas pair, and a number of banking chiefs
were the other noticeable people.
The Gaud Mayoress Vas issued invitations
to meet the departing Denman lady over a
cup of tea, in the Town Hall, on Tuesday
afternoon, May 13.
Lovie Mueller Cadorin (she is now
threatening us with a couple of concerts)
displayed the collection of Greek and Byzan-
tine wraps and gowns, at the Centreway, on
Friday. A living model paraded round, decked
in a succession of interesting duds designed
by artist Fortuny, and Mrs. Cadorin herself
fluttered about in a sort of inspired green
and gold nightgown. The Denman lady,
who came early to avoid the rush, was
anxious to bid for the lot, but in the end
was pacified with two garments and a
promise of all the surplus. Her Ex. takes
an interest in Lovie, who is well acquainted
with an aunt of the G.-G. lady, who resides
in Florence. Chamberlain Nevill looked in
on the gay scene, and the sculptor husband
hovered on the edge of the crowd. Even
Alex. Landale’s widow- was enticed from her
retreat by the unusual finery. Mrs. Pins-
chof, with a trousseau problem looming
ahead of her, looked at everything with a
business eye, and handsome Mrs. Crowley
figured amongst the enthusiasts.
Dr. Hordern, who plays first-class cricket
w-hen not otherwise engaged, is now- honey-
mooning in Melbourne. Menzies’ is shel-
tering him and his bride during their stay.
An interesting three-brush art party opened
last week in the Centreway, where the walls
are carefully covered with the work of May
Roxburgh, Dora Wilson and Percy Leason.
All three hail frojn the National Gallery.
Friends and relations do their duty nobly
by wandering in with a vague smile and all
the adjectives left over from last month’s
canvas-gazing.
Henrietta Walker (she used to be Hen-
rietta McGowan) still follows the inky way.
This time her busy nib is represented by a
neat blue volume entitled “Rafia Work.” It
tells you exactly, in plain language, how to
make rafia into hats, buttons, hammocks
and floor-coverings. Apparently, the sub-
stance is becoming one of the indispensable
household commodities.
Pianist Edward Goll and his wife are stay-
ing with the lady’s sister at Balwyn. Ed-
w-ard’s marriage was not exactly a May and
December affair; it was, say, May and
August. And Mrs. August is a very w-in-
some; person. Artists usually need someone
to lPok after them, and the bushy-haired
pianist seems to be amply provided for.
The Cliveden flatteries are echoing unusual
yelps, shouts and cacklings. The uproar has
been traced to the Madden corner, where
daughter Lesly is rehearsing a theatrical
show. Rehearsals happen on the landings
and in any convenient corner, and the time
is drawing near w-hen society, blessed by all
available vice-regality, will stifle its yawns
at the finished performance.
The Butt-Rumford family is migrating
this week to Cliveden, where several acres
of floor space have been reserved.
The Nyulasy medicine man has steamed
off to Maoriland, accompanied by a couple of
sisters, to acquire a new brother-in-law.
Marguerite, the elder sister, is the bride-
elect, and she is to marry Mr. Cowper, a re-
tired banker who is well-known at the best
male clubs. Marguerite kept her matri-
monial intentions a dark secret. In fact,
the Toorak W omen s League, whereof she
was treasurers, will have to send its Wh
ding present on by post. The function h t
be dressed in tailor-mades. 10
One of the Officer brothers has quitted th P
parental farm where the ostriches grow tail
feathers, and said farewell to the T
Charm Cricket Club. The team (which he
captained) sent him off with a dinner ana
laudatory speeches, likewise a leather suit
Two courageous young persons have added
their names to the list of Melbourne busi
ness women Ivy Stuckey is one, and she
is collaborating with another small venturer
by the name of Jacobs. They intend to run
a toilet salon until lately propelled by two
other girls Charming little Ivy, who shines
as a social entertainer in a strictly amateur
way, is closely related to the author of a
new order of tlakey food, which is flaked in
Austraha, and is beginning to proclaim itself
loudly from the hoardings.
The explosive Hakes have scored their
return voyage from England off the list of
social events, and have directed that their
choice collection of antiques be shinned from
Toorak to Italy, . where they 1 P (mean-
ing the Hakes primarily) intend to live
for a space. Mrs. Hake was one of the
John Simson clan, a fact which spells end
less wealth. By the way, sister Mrs Scobie
Mackmnon, together with Scobie and their
pigeon pair, are about to move into Beaulieu
—the Mars Buckley house of old. The
place is now glorified out of recognition.
The Taverner couple show no desire to
wrestle with the domestic problem in this
part of the world. Nowadays they feel lost
out of the smoke and noise of London, and
are inclined to pine for the friends
they have made thereabouts; so it is
possible they may presently get back
to _ the ant-hill by the Thames. Mean-
while, the Oriental supplies them with
board and lodging. John has put on flesh
during his years of pleasant exile; he has
also acquired a bucolic flush. His dame, on
the contrary, shows a slimmer figure line
than of yore, with a more subdued color
scheme. The pair have added an adopted
girl-child to their responsibilities, thus con-
verting the domestic duet into a trio.
A young man has disappeared from his
usual haunts. A relative who fetched him
out here and put him in the way of earning a
crust, grew tired of his expensive tastes, for
which the relative had to pay. Not so long
ago the nephew’s name was coupled with
that of a local heiress, but nothing has come
of it up to date. Possibly the sorrow is
being drowned in beef-tea or something. I
suggest this victual because I don’t like it
myself, and anyone who wants it can have
my share of all the beef-tea on earth.
Seems that Clara the Gigantic is bringing
the same luggage as before to Australia, or
even more so. Husband Kennerley Rumford
dees not come under the heading of luggage,
of course. The three children, two gover-
nesses, a tutor, three maids, and a valet, who
tiavel with the Butt pair, are the burden of
responsibilities. In addition to the family
party there is to be a trio of surmorting
artists on the tour —Frank Carter, the Syd-
ney violinist: Harold Craxton, accompanist;
end Willie Murdoch, the pianist, who has
lalely made good in Melbourne. Clara, Ken-
nerley and the other 10 souls are due in Syd-
ney front Vancouver on the 10th. The con-
cert tour starts in the brand-new Tait Con-
cert Hall, in Melbourne, a week later.
From across the Straits :
Australia’s broadest-minded bishop, Dr. Mercer,
who throws off his apron and gaiters in a few
months’ time, is said to be about to commit matri-
mony (his second offence) with one of the “poor
widows” who are subject to, the cruel Federal land
tax. The relict of a former member of Parliament,
who was also a railway contractor, is named as the
disintegrator of the Tasmanian bishopric; and the
alleged intention of the couple is to sojourn a while
in the south of France, where the atmosphere is
supposed to be congenial for the making of a few
books, which his Lordship has promised himself to
write.
Maybe an Art and Law Guild will event-
uate from the intrusion of Gretchen Lesch-
kau among the lawyers of Temple Court.
The little dark-eyed paintress, who includes
a National Gallery prize among her creden-
tials, has ooened a studio in the vast build-
ing (No. 25). Where she wflll take classes in
drawing, painting and applied arts. Gov.
Carmichael of yore remarked that he had
never been quite clear about the meaning of
“applied art,” though he knew misapplied
art when he saw it. But gentle Gretchen
gives lessons in the thing which puzzled his
Ex. The studio is furnished with an interest-
ing collection of her own achievements in oil
and watercolor.

A RIME OF STOUT AND STOUSH.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
He dearly loves a fight. He can use the gloves,
as the interrupters at his meetings have occasion to
know. — Argus eulogy of a Liberal candidate
USH/’JS).
The candidate got up, a man of worth and probity,
And spoke his mind: “I am agin’ the Gover’ment,”
said he,
And, when a rude soul asked him “Why ?” he
lifted up his mit
And smote the forward one a really nasty blow with
it.
“I plead,” he said (and how the long, loud, wild ap-
plause did crash!)
“For freedom, and the right to stoush, for liberty
and lash!”
A plain, hard-working man then rose and asked:
“Is it a fact ?”
The candidate let out and smote the blighter in the
act;
And yet another bloke began: “Do you believe —— ?”
No more
Was heard from him, for Fat’s knight-errant
punched him through the door.
Early and late the candidate left-hooked, and crossed
again,
Until the staggered floor was strewn with senseless
working men.
With right and left he kept the interjectors on the
jump.
“ What of our bleeding country?’’ [Biff!] “What
price Australia?” [Bump!]
And glad old ladies, mad with joy, leapt up and
down, and squealed
As his clenched fists shut up each mouth and stricken
voters reeled.
Right-thinkers, parsons, thin old maids—all sorts of
earnest folk
Emitted yelps of sheer delight at each new head he
broke.
He pleaded for plain justice—-and, at every other
word,
He drove his knuckles here and there among the
doubting herd ;
They howled for peace and reason, but he punched
their noses flat
While Slowgress cheered and howled with joy, and
flung aloft its hat.
“I stand [bash, bangl] for Slowgress [crack ! ] —to
hold what we/have got;
And [biff, bang, bump, crash, batter, thump!]
you’re with me, are you not?”
FRANK HENTY.
Yarraby, Glen Iris, Victoria.]
POLITICAL
POINTS
A DREADFUL POSSIBILITY.
Whilst we are determined to prevent the trusts
obtaining a hold on Australia, surely there is some
method more practical, less drastic, and less unjust
than these Referendum proposals.
—Wade on the Referenda.
WADE : “Hit him with this. That is much
too drastic. Why, it might KILL him."
[FRANK JESSUP, 52 Renwick-street, Leichhardt.]
From Leonard James Watson, Orrong-
road„ Elsternwick, Victoria :
The amazing differences in State laws dealing with
friendly societies provide one of many reasons why
lodge members should shout an enthusiastic “Yes”
to the Referendum proposals on May 31. At the re-
cent H.A.C.B.S. conference, in Melbourne, one of the
delegates, brought forward a motion affirming the
necessity of Commonwealth legislation for the con-
trol of friendly societies, but he pointed out that
unless the “Corporations” Referendum was carried,
the thing couldn’t be done. In a two hours’ debate
it was shown that an overwhelming majority of the
delegates favored the proposal; but the chairman
finally ruled it out, on the ground that political
questions couldn’t, be voted on by the Order. With
Commonwealth legislation on the lines of the Ma
State’s Act, there would not be so much doubt as to
the solvency of some of the friendly societies, and
then there wouldn’t be need for such scathing reports
as those presented this year and last by the secre-
tary of the big Oddfellows’ Order.
Liberalism would have a smoother road
to pedal if there were more women voters
like the one encountered recently by two
Victorian lady canvassers. “You belong to
the League, of course,” cooed the spokes-
woman. “No, I don’t,” replied the cheerful
lady of the house, a property owner of many
years’ standing. “But you’re not going to
vote Labor, are you?” they duetted
anxiously. The voter folded her hands, and,
with the placid air of one who has put her
trust in Heaven and handed over the keys
of Destiny, replied: “ I'm going to do what-
ever the Argus tells me!" Votes for
Women ! Blessed be the Argus !
[Ernest Francis O’Fkrrall, The Bulletin Office,
Sydney.]
Victorians are a long-suffering people.
Recently the municipal council of Wonthaggi
circularised its fellow councils as to inter-
viewing the Government to ask that the
public might be allowed to buy its own Won-
thaggi coal. The proposal was cordially re-
ceived, and a large deputation spoke with
John Weary. John said that he was very
sorry, but the present output of Gipps-
land coal was barely sufficient fur the
railways, so there was none left for tne
public. That looked conclusive —or did
until certain persons pointed out
to the tired statesman that bores put
down prove that there is a large body of
workable coal in the vicinity of Wonthaggi,
and that the output from the otate mine
could be largely increased by the tremend-
ously uncomplicated process of merely dig-
ging out some of it. At this point it was
discovered that John was only talking in his
sleep, and the deputation withdrew softly,
carrying its boots in its hand, for fear of
shaking him un too much.
The perishment of N.S.W.’s once promis-
ing ship-building industry under Foreign-
trade conditions, was emphasised one recent
day in Sydney Telegraph, but the paper
wasn’t thereby moved to shove High Protec-
tion into the forefront of the Federal battle,
as David shoved Uriah after seeing Bath-
sheba washing herself in the second Book of
Samuel. During the five vears to 1880 the
vessels built at Sydney alone represented
16,551 tons. The five years to 1885 saw the
culmination- —24,949 tons. Then came the
lesser and the greater and the intermediate
slump—Bo46 tons, 4907 tons, 7434 tons,
8255 tons and 5114 tons, each figure reore-
senting a period of five years. And in 1911
came the really bitter slump, when ship con-
struction, including motor-boats, got down to
986 tons, or at the rate of 4930 tons for five
years. The increase of wages, without any
corresponding measure of Protection against
low-wage competitors outside, has almost
driven this once promising trade out of Syd-
ney. As for the outports of N.S.W., it was
practically driven out of them long ago. Some
of the places that used to build ships have
now almost forgotten what a ship is like. ,
[James Edmond, The Bulletin Office, Sydney.]
Last Thursday Syd-
ney Telegraph, cham-
pioning Joe Cook against
the gibe of the Prime
Minister that the Fusion
leader had faced every
point of the political
compass, asked plaintive-
ly: “But has Mr. Cook
ever faced the Socialist
point?” And the answer
is: “ Yes, certainly.”
During 1891-4, in the
N.S.W. Legislature, Joe
Cook was leader of the
Labor party. The Tele-
graph of the time used
to say the Labor party
was Socialistic. And the
Telegraph claims to
know a bit. So what
could be more conclusive?
[C. A. Jeffries. The Bulletin Office, Sydney.]
Politician Catts (N.S.W.) got on the roof
one day last week and bristled his tail and
said things. Incidentally, he handed in his
mouse and his job and his resignation.
Catts had long been secretary of the Amal-
gamated Railway and Tramway Service
Association, and his general plaint was that
that organisation was a hard master, a bitter
nigger-driver, and a thankless boss. Exit
Catts.
It was bound to come. The Sydney
Telegraph, a Federal election being on
hand, has been, for the billionth time or
thereabouts, flabbergasted within an inch of
its life at the progress which Imported
Shoddy doctrines are making in Victoria. In
its own words: “The jmunger voters, and
the women voters in particular, seem to be
giving an acceptance to Freetrade views to
an extent that was not quite hoped for by
the propagandists.” That great Freetrade
revival has been just about to burst over
Melbourne since the day when Henry
Parkes wrote his first poem. And it is still
about to burst—when it gets rested and finds
its second wind.
[James Edmond, The Bulletin Office, Sydney.]
An heroic cablegram of last week set forth
that “200,000 men were drilling nightly in
Belfast and adjoining counties,” to be ready
to fight against Irish Home Rule, and among
them thev had 140,000 rifles. Maybe!
But in all Ulster there are less
than 1,600,000 people. Of these over
800,000 are Home Rulers. When from
the other less-than : 800,000 are deducted
women, boys, girls and the aged,
sick and insane, it must be a desperately
hard struggle to find 200,000 men to “drill
nightly.” It would probably be necessary to
stop all trams, trains, theatres, ferry-boats,
cabs and picture-shows, and close all shops,
and rake in even the police in order to get
half that number.
JOE'S THE CREDIT.
They are a set of political purloiners. (Laughter
and cheers.) They have taken our schemes —defence,
Federal capital, old-age pensions, etc....and now
they say they are theirs. The defence scheme, both
land and sea, is ours—I passed it —etc.
GARDENER ANDY (proudly): “ Yes, it’s cornin'
on fine. Planted it and nurtured it , pruned
and tended it with me own hands."
Ex-GARDENER JOE : “Hmp! But don't fergrt
it was me 'oo got tired and dropped the
twig which you picked up an' pruned an'
planted an' tended.," etc., etc .
[TED COLLES, Kogarah, Sydney.]
According to Sydney Telegraph, W. 11.
Irvine, at Shepparton (Vic.), remarked:
“When we read in the official Referenda state-
ment the declaration that there are at least
33 combines at present devouring the sub-
stance of the people, can there be any doubt
that the Labor party is already showing the
first symptoms of the state popularly de-
scribed as ‘seeing things’?” The Labor
party made no such statement. It merely
quoted the statement may by Glynn, Attor-
ney-General of the Deakin Fusion Ministry ;
so if the Labor party is “seeing things” it
caught the disease from Deakin’s own
crowd.
[C. A. Jeffries, The Bulletin Office, Sydney.]
Joe Cook goes round the country asking
plaintively, “Why is it our opponents will
not submit to the will of the people when
it has been so definitely expressed?” It is
a fine old Tory attitude ; and, like most Tory
attitudes, it is rotten. Wherefore doesn’t
Joe Cook ask himself why, Providence hav-
ing made a coal-miner of him (Providence
does everything), he tried to become a poli-
tician and a Cabinet Minister and a Pre-
mier? And why doesn’t Joseph ask his
friends in the rag-importing trade why, hav-
ing stocked only stay-laces to begin with,
they weren’t content to go on stocking no-
thing but stay-laces? Also, as a distin-
guished military and naval expert, he might
drop a line to Lord Roberts asking that little
man why he didn’t turn back after his first
reverse.' And, finally, as. a Methody “local
preacher,” he might throw a hymn-book at
himself for preaching a second sermon to a
sinner who hadn’t come along to the peni-
tent form at the first time of asking.
[S. H. Prior, The Bulletin Office, Sydney.]
Thus Charles Gregory Wade, ex-Premier
of N.S.W., to the electors of Leichhardt in
his own State (the writer quotes from
memory and tries to put the emphasis where
he thinks the great man put it) :
We have the experience of the United States of
America to guide us at this Juncture, and the
Federal scheme has not There been altered for 130
years. I would ask you whether America has ad-
vanced during the last 100 years. The undoubted
advance that America has made has Taken Place
under a Constitution THAT left local questions to
local people We should take the example of
America, etc.
And The Bulletin, for one. is willing to
“take the example,” especially in the matter
of High Protection. As regards the vote
which is to be taken presently re the amend-
ment of the Australian Constitution it is
worth mentioning that ten amendments of
the United States Constitution were carried
almost immediately after the said Constitu-
tion started. (It began in 1789.) In 1794-
1798 (it took four years to get an'amend-
ment through) the eleventh amendment was
carried. This eleventh job was finished nine
years after the establishment of the Consti-
tution. The fifteenth amendment of the
U.S. Constitution was definitely passed in
1870. So, after all, Australia won’t be
making an unprecedented wreck of its Fed-
eral arrangements even if the proposed
amendments are carried.
[James Edmond, The Bulletin Office. Sydney.]
F.S. : Argument has been rife in Mel
bourne, of late, on the question of strikes
and how to stop them. One “A 1 Rakim”
wrote to the Age suggesting the disfran-
chisement of strikers, and barrister Coldham
of all men, supported him. Of course such
a scheme wouldn’t work for a minute as
several authorities (H. M. Murphy, Vic-
toria’s Chief Factories Inspector, ' among
them) hastened to point out. Preference to
unionists and a system of levving on Union
funds is the likeliest remedy. The Law should
compel unions to keep publicly-audited ac-
counts, levy sufficient dues to form a consid-
erable and valuable fund, and make such
funds seizable on failure to keep an agree-
ment. The same with employers. The suf-
fering public would thus recoup itself some-
what ; the strikers would suffer through
having to submit to heavier levies to make
up the fund, and the vast majority of
workers, being then obviously in the unions
would be under some sort of control.
That weird political circum-
stance, Dr. Arthur, of N.S.W
rose up in the Sydney Tf.te-
graph last week to explain
that the Trusts in the Enina
States “have only been made
possible through the High
Protection tariff.” Now, if
High Protection is the cause
of Trusts, how do they exist
so numerously in Freetrade
Britain? An explanation 0 f
this fact would be interesting.
Also, Dr. Arthur might explain
how it is that the first great
United States Trust, the Stan-
dard Oil, grew up under abso-
lutely Freetrade conditions.
There was no Protective tariff
nor any other kind of tariff
on imported oil, unless the
goods came from a country
which imposed a duty on
United States oil. The Stan-
dard had no natural mono-
poly. Russia was an oil-pro-
ducing country before white
men went to America, and it
imposed no duty on Yankee
oil when that product came
on the market. Scotland used to export
petroleum to the U.S.A., and it also imposed
no duty on Yankee oil. Yet Standard Oil
was the first and greatest of all the Yankee
Trusts. The water-drinking doctor should
take another look at his facts.
[C. A. Jeffries, The Bulletin Office, Sydnev.l
LONG ODDS.
One of the defects of Parliamentary Government
at present is the instability of Parliament... The
real trouble With Parliament is that it is too
easily moved by passing moods of public opinion.
—Mournful plaint of Irvine, M.P.
THE ERRING ONE (not too hopefully): “He
certainly 'as a hun/air hadvantage hover
me up there—'cause it ain't no joke for a
person uv my style an' character t' battle
up them stairs an' get taken back on a job
agen!"
“When a man’s house is on fire,” wrote
Bruce Smith in a recent letter, alluding to
the alleged fires of Socialism, it isn’t the
time to divide the forces of anti-Sosh b.v
raising the fiscal issue. That metaphor
about the burning house used to be George
Reid’s stock-in-trade. The Bulletin
thought some one had long since poured a
spoonful of beer over the old blaze and put
it out.

SPORTING
NOTIONS
Melbourne s various hoofball teams con-
cussed on Saturday in ideal football weather, and
some strenuous scuffles ensued. Though the season
is only two weeks old, ’Wood alone remains un-
beaten. It encountered Geelong on Saturday, and
routed it with difficulty by nine points, alter a game
that was anybody’s right up to the bell-ring. ’Wood
had the better system, but the Seasiders' marking
was excellent, and their long, accurate kicking
superb. The scores—-’Wood, io goals 17 behinds;
Geelong, 11 goals two behinds—tell their own tale,
lor some inscrutable reason the annual collision of
Sowth” and Carlton, on the latter’s ground, always
provides an exciting contest, and Saturday’s was no
exception. Neither team goes in for much system,
though South’s is the better, but in fast, clean, open
play, with fine, long kicking and good marking, both
excelled. By greater accuracy in goal shooting South
kept a few points ahead till, on starting the last
quarter, it had a goal and a half to the good. But
that last quarter belonged to the Old Blues, and they
steadily accumulated singles till the tale stood 61
all Then the bell rang on a beautiful draw—
Carlton, eight goals 13 behinds; South, nine goals
seven behinds. The Essendon-Richmond skirmish was
also exciting, the Yellow-and-Blacks having, with the
advent of a new secretary, decided to bury their
squabbles and battle as one man. They battled so
heftily that they were only four points behind ’Don
at lemon-time, and had overtaken them before the
close; but an extra-strenuous rush of the “Same
Old gave Don a couple of goals, and the game
ended: Richmond, 78 points; ’Don, 89. ’Varsity,
playing Melbourne, kept almost level till the last
interval, but failed to keep going in the final quar-
ter —the usual lack of training—-and lost by 72
points to Melbourne’s 99. ’Rov should have given
a good account of itself against St. Kilda, but seemed
to have forgotten all it ever knew about the game,
and could only accumulate a miserable 34 to Saints’
67.
* * * *
The chief Ass. scuffle—North v. ’Don—
furnished a surprise for some 5000 onlookers, and a
considerable shock to the premiers, who were held
comfortably throughout, and ultimately demolished
by 1 8 points to ’Don’s 62. Brunswick visited the
suburb once sacred to Thomas Adolphus Bent, and
defeated it with difficulty, mainlv through its utter
inability to direct the ball—’Wick, eight goals 20
behinds; Brighton, eight goals seven behinds. P’ran
paralysed Melb. City by 100 points to 45; ’Town
routed ’Cote by 60 to 37 ; and ’Scray smashed up
Port by 77 to 33. The repeated wallopings of
these disorganised teams get on the nerves; under
a proper scheme of district hoofball some of them
would annually descend to a lower grade, where they
might have a chance to break the monotony by
scoring an occasional win.
* * * *
N.S.W. Rugby League onened its compe-
tition in Sydney on Saturday, and, in spite of other
attractions, such as watching the march past of
20,000 cadets under arms, ogling Hospital girls, and
so forth, the cult of the muddv leather bubble
attracted somewhere about 40,000 people to the
various grounds. The star match of the day was
that between Eastern Suburbs and Newtown at
Sydney Cricket Ground. Eastern Suburbs was the
premier team last season, and was generally under-
stood to be in a frenzy of rage and despair because
Dally Messenger’s wife had persuaded him to retire
from the game, and he had sufficient sense to allow
himself to be persuaded. Still he left a very prom-
ising brother,, W. Messenger, to perpetuate the
family horfor and fame, and W. kicked the first goal
of the afternoon. The general opinion was that Newtown
had absolutely no hope, and would be chewed right
up, stamped flat, and generally thrown to the winds.
East opened with a charge which drove Newtown
back on to its line. But the line was cleared. East
came again, and this time burst through with great
violence, and W. Messenger kicked the goal. New-
town pulled itself together, the captain howled like
a wolf; and that mighty forward, Murray, right in
the van, began to accomplish things. He took the
bone of contention along at the toe. and was doing
splendidly when someone took it right off his toe
and reversed the position. Murray still had his toe,
but he didn’t have the ball. But this time the New-
town defence was magnificent, and one after another
the Eastern champions were hauled down and thrown
back across the line. Newtown let loose a counter
attack, and blew at a great pace right down the field
and over the line. The kick failed. Then East lost
i+s combination and went in for individualism, while
Newtown stuck to Socialism and discipline, and at
half-time led by 10 to seven. The second half was
solid bullocking from start to finish, and East, having
recovered its discipline, had the best of it. Towards
the end Newtown, now hovering in the rear,
straggled desperately to equalise, and succeeded in
reducing the margin to two. But time ran out,
the whVle blew and East was triumphant bv 17 to
15. Which in League Rugby is a mighty close thing.
Another straggle of some size was that between
North Sydney and Glebe at the former’s ground.
Glebe at first romped over the hillmen and ended
the first half with 11 points to two. The second
half saw North Svdnev make heroic efforts to wipe
out the margin, but the men of Glebe were too strong
and won with 19 to 15. Balmain managed to fust,
hold down Annandale w ; th seven points to five. The
onlv run-away victory of the day was that of South
Svdnev over the Western Suburbs team, wh'uh it
crushed bv 33 to 11. So Eastern Suburbs, Globe,
Balmain and South Svdneu are each two competition
points and the rest are nil.
* * * *
The Rugby Union also onened its compe-
tition on Saturday, and for an allegedly dying cause
it had a lot of onlookers. Evidently the old line
game still has its admirers. At University Oval,
Glebe and Western Suburbs collided in a grim, hard-
fought struggle utterly devoid of brilliance. It con-
sisted of all kicks and no limelight. Glebe won by
six points to three and a large streak of luck.
University gave St. George a torrid time at Hurst-
vine and finally rubbed its hat in the mud by 16
points to six. North Sydney put up a sparkling
game with Newtown, which also coruscated, and
victory rested with the North by 19 points to 14.
Balmain fell on South Sydney and walloped it by 29
points to 12; while Eastern Suburbs journeyed by
sea to Manly and jumped on the Village by 14 points
to 11.
* f * * *
The Australian Rulers also opened their
competition on Saturday, but, by some accident,
bungled the time-table of their star match, that
between Sydney and South Svdne.v. It was 3.40
p.m. before the sides took the field, and a good
game was spoiled by beihg played out in the dark
when most of the audience were on the way to tea
or the nearest bars. There were no startling results,
and the games ended practically true to last year’s
form, East Sydney downing Newtown by 83 points
to 29 ; while Sydney scrunched South Sydney by 81
points to 16, and Paddington overthrew North
Shore by 99 points to 60.
* * * *
The Soccer crowd, which has about three
competitions to get through during the season,
started the Rawson Cup Armageddon on Saturday.
Balmain, the champion club, raged against New-
town, overthrew it and also tell upon it at Epping
racecourse by one goal to nil. Mitchell, the aoal-
keeper of the defeated team, covered himself with
glory, though he could not avert the disaster. On
the same ground Sydney defeated Annandale by five
goals to two —a big margin at Soccer. Granville
scrunched Canterbury away out at Clyde, 13 miles
from Sydney, by three to nil, and 'Gle.be banged
Northern Suburbs by seven goals to nil. Which was
an awful doing.
* * * *
“Touchline” writes: I rise to remark that
N.S.W. Rugby Union is far from being the dead
horse which rival football bodies fondly imagine it
is. It is a case of the wish and the thought! The
Union’s international scheme makes it appear that
the looked-for demise is still several years away.
Joining hands with the Maoriland Rugby Union, the
N.S.W. body will make an effort to bring an Eng-
lish XV to Australia in 1915 and a South African
mob in 1916. Also, 1915 will probably see an Aus-
tral-Maoriland XV visit the United States. Mean-
while the inter-Sfhte and club programme is quite
big enough to keep the wreck afloat the meanwhile.
The set-back will Drobably prove to be a blessing
very well disguised.
* » * *
English papers note, as signs of the inter-
national spread of Soccer football, that an English
team has toured Portugal (of all places), and that
a 20,000 gate has been reached in Berlin. But even
20,000 is small pumpkins compared with the 111,000
at the Crystal Palace last week. Still, the Crystal
Palace isn’t Berlin.
* * * *
In all branches of Labor the workers’ dis-
satisfaction with the “speeding-up” system is finding
active expression. Last week a deputation of race-
horses waited upon the A.J.C. stewards, to protest
against the practice frequently adopted by the
“bosses” in classic events of starting animals as
pace-makers, with a view to busting the field along.
Dismal Willie, an aaed grey,l said, in introducing
the deputation, that the time was now ripe for abol-
ishing the pernicious time-limit, which, in the not-
able case of the Champion Stakes, established at
Flemington by the V.R.C., had been responsible for
many cases of leg-weariness. Slowladdie reminded
the chairman that many wealthy employers, de-
scribed as “keen sports” (neighs of derision) gave
orders for a stable compan.on of the favorite,
usually a young, impetuous beast —(neighs of
“Shame”) —to be driven along from the start, in
order to find out weak spots in the non-stayers.
Sugarloaf, who claimed to be always one of the best
in a field of non-triers, remarked that the result of
starting a pacemaker was to “speed-up” the others.
Hoarse Chestnut complained that it encouraged
sweating all round, and many other neighers warmly
supported his contention. The chairman promised
the deputation that something should be done in
the matter. He didn’t think the stewards would be
able to suppress sprinting altogether, but he thought
that the go-slow habit could be widely extended
by offering substantial prizes to the three last horses
in all handicaps and w.f.a. races. The , gathering
then kicked up its heels and withdrew.

“Adelaide”: A word about “Brickbat’s”
denunciation of the alleged keeping down and out
of juniors in Adelaide cricket (B. 24/4/’l3). At
first sight, it is laughably incorrect, with two men
just from school in the State XI, and East Torrens
placed easily top of all the clubs by the help in great
part of men whose names Bulletin readers
outside S.A. wouldn’t know if they were set
down here. I asked the opinion of three
prominent players, all young themselves, about
“Brickbat.” “Absurd!” said two of them.
“In our clubs, we have every chance given us; and
there are two other clubs with hardly any but
juniors.” The third authority thought it might be
true concerning two other clubs, which he named.
So “Brickbat’s” mud-slinging is perhaps one-third
true. And he may remember what Tennyson wrote
of that kind of mis-statement.
Bill Lang accomplished his resurrection
stunt to the accompaniment of wild applause at
Sydney Stadium on Saturday night, when, after 20
rounds, he was awarded the verd:ct over Petty Officer
Curran. Still, it would be well for Lang to refrain
from any tendency to swelled head over the victory,
for Curran was in anything but good condition, while
Lang was about the most perfectly trained man who
ever entered a ring. He had worked hard, solidly
and conscientiously at his preparation, and, verily,
he had his reward, and also, verily, he deserved it.
It is said that Curran was heavier than on the day
when he stepped off the steamer's deck. Be that as
it may, his fatness was calculated to stagger
humanity. His stomach ballooned over his waist-
band. Across the small of his back were the traces
of a belladonna plaster, showing that the sometme
defender of Ladysmith had been suffering from rheu-
matism. How on earth he lasted the 20 rounds in
his hog-stout condition is one of the mysteries of
this world. It is said that he never trains very hard,
and has a firm belief that meat is reserve power,
which he can let loose anywhere between the 18th
and 20th round. Everybody waited on Saturday
night to see the “letting loose,” but it never came
off’ ami Curran didn’t sparkle a cent. His seconds
said he had ricked his side ; someone else in author-
ity said he had damaged his hand ; but many believe
his bingey had fallen on him and killed hm. Lang,
on the other hand, had only the bingey requisite and
necessary to carry on the work of assimilation, it
was flat as a board, if not actually concave, and
Lang's care in keepihg it out of the danger zone is to
be highly commended. Here endeth the chapter on
bingeys.
The actual fight started splendidly. In the begin-
ning Curran rushed into the van of the battle with
a splendid burst of energy and ferocity. He hunted
Lang all over the ring, and finally sent him down for
four. Then Lang grew wary, and met Curran’s
rushes with straight lefts, which were hard to en-
dure. But Curran bored in, and while taking a
monumental hiding administered one just as large.
He had a good defence, and he crossed like lightning
and shook Lang badly. While his steam was at full
head Curran did magnificently, and belted the devil
out of Lang in spite of the superior condition of the
Austral an. Lang saved himself considerably by
good footwork, and at every opportunity his left fell
like a falling tenement. For a time Curran man-
aged to cross quickly and cleanly with the right,
and the result was that for a time Lang’s nose wa«
seriously deteriorated, and 10 per cent, had to be
written off the feature for depreciation. Then Lang
managed to split Curran’s cheek, and the 12th, the
most exciting round of the battle, ended amidst a
storm of applause. After that Curran’s attack wilted
and faded out, the seaman acting entirely on
the defensive and only occasionally sending heavy
wallops as he retreated. Lang grew more and more
aggressive, and Curran, about whom there is no
beastly pride, did not hesitate to literally flee before
the fury of the storm. But alwavs he came back,
advanced as if to the attack, and fell into a clinch.
The 14th found Curran still sprinting, and so did
the 15th, but in this he came back and opened an
old wound over Lang’s eye. In the 18th Curran
made a brave attempt to cut loose, but couldn’t. He
was moored to his bingey. The 19th was a round of
clinches and heavy body blows, and so was the 20th.
Then the gong sounded, and Scott placed his hand
on Lang’s head. Curran sat down, had his face
washed, went over and shook hands, apparently
quite unmoved. And yet it was a hard fight, full
of heavy battery. And that was how Lang came
back.
* * * *
Another man who talks of coming back is
none other than the one and only Jim Jeffries. His
last effort was a ghastly- failure, and Johnson was
supposed to have killed his aspiration for a return
ticket. The mention of his intended resurrection
moved some of the scribes to dwell on his general
demeanor prior to that downfall. There was a small
army of newspaper men at his camp writing up his
training, and it seems to have been the great fighter’s
joy in life to insult every one of them during the
course of the day. Johnson was fairly arrogant, but he
is said to have been all charm and modesty compared
to the bull-necked Jeffries. The latter’s resurrection
announcement roused a storm of press disapproval,
in which he was accused of having thrown away
the championship to Johnson for the sake of the
boodle he would get out of it. win, lose or draw. It
is hardly a fair charge, as Johnson was practically
champion before he met Jeffries. Jeffries had no
championship to lose, as he had prev'ously retired.
But Jeffries seems to be only a shade less unpopular
than Johnson himself.
* * * *
Talking of Johnson reminds that Samuel
Fitzpatrick, who brought the negro to Australia,
and practically gave him his start in glory by bring-
ing off the fight with Burns, got no share of the
wealth Johnson garnered as the result of that vic-
tory. He has now retired from the strenuous task
of looking after pugs, and settled down in a quiet,
comfortable cafe on 24th-street, New York. He
remarks that he lifted Johnson from the free-lunch
class, and if the authorities will let the Murky One
get away from Chicago, Johnson is welcome to the
best his free-lunch counter affords. But, somehow,
the authorities seem to hate the thought of letting
Johnson out of their sight, and haye more than once
gone to a lot of trouble to bring him back when he
has strolled away.
* * *
A 1 Palzer, who for a time loomed large as
a White Hope, is now general'y regarded as what the
Yankees call a “bust volcano.” He is, or was lately,
in Paris, weiring to fix up a fight with Johnson as
soon as the Streak could get over his argument
with the Law authorities in Chicago. Palzer belongs
to the numerous class known as “natural fighters,”
a type of scrapper which rapidly degenerates when
hard work is given over. He had several spells of
idleness, and could not be induced to train properly
for what fights he did have in between, with the re-
sult that he is said to have cut a poor figure in the
ring. What fights- these were is impossible to say,
as they were evidently not worth cabling, and the
commentators do not give details. But one thing is
evident—that Palzer has either slumped or got
up the back of the great Amurkan press.
* * * *
After much going up and down the conti-
nent, newspaper puffing, alleged secrecy, and other
frills, E. R. Mayne got some sort of a cricket team
together for his raid on the United States. Twenty-
five engagements have already been fixed up, and the
team is open for more. Which sounds strange along-
side Mr. Mavne’s statement that the team is going
for pleasure only and not for boodle, and has not
even considered how it will whack the profits should
any accrue. Of course, it is an easy thing to avoid
having any profits. Only 12 men are going, and a
reserve of one is a mighty weak entrenchment for
a foreign raid. Trumper did not go. Business
matters compelled him to give up the idea, though
he liked it very much. Altogether the Mayne cric-
ket team is just as much of a mystery as it was at
the beginning.
N.S.W. Cyclists’ Union has definitely de-
cided that Australia shall be represented by a road-
racer in the Olympic Cycle Race at Berlin in 1916.
A fund has been started to collect the £2OO which
it is reckoned will be necessary to do the thing pro-
perly. The next job is to find the man, who must
be an extra special, dyed-in-the-wool champion of
road work. He wll take more finding than the
£2OO, mine tink it. as Billy. Rex would say. To
assist in the job of locating him a 130-mile race is
to be held this winter between Goulburn and Sydney,
over the route of the old-time Dunlop fixture. The
date has (n.v.) been fixed for June 23.
* * * »
T.ast year the Dunlop Co. offered to donate
£25 towards a Tamwort.h-Newcastle road race for
cyclists, but owing to the usual trouble between
the northern clubs of N.S.W. and the, League of
Wheelmen, the idea was dropped. However, the
sky is now calfn, the outlook halcyon, and the idea
has revived, like the grass in the” soft spring rain.
The Dunlop gift of £25 for first prize is understood
to be still on tap, and this season is likely to see
the event pulled off. The distance is 160 miles and
the roads are often figures of speech only; so, be-
sides being the longest of road races it is likely to
be the toughest.
A. V; Turner, the N.S.W. motorist who
intended, to attack White's Sydney to Melbourne re-
cord of 19hr. 47min. last week, had to postpone
his effort. Heavy rains on the Victorian side ren-
dered the tracks more suitable for a motor-launch
than a car, especially between Sevmour and Wan-
tfaratta. However, the attempt will be made as
early as possible, perhaps this week, in an Ameri-
can 50-h.n. underslung chassis, fitted with a light
racing bodv. Two powerful searchlights, in addi-
tion to the ordinary glaring head lamps, will be
fitted to the car to enable pace to be made through
the darkness. White’s record dates back to March,

Saturday was a day of rout and butcherv
among the Sydney bowlers in the preliminary rounds
of the Rawson Cun. The result of the riot and
rout-was to leave City, Mosman, Parramatta and St
George to battle in the semi-final next Saturday
afternoon. Another disturbance the same afternoon
was the final of the “B” competition. The Orange
(N.S.W.) rink fell on Mosman ip the morning and
walloped it by 69 to 61, and in the afternoon it got
loose on and all over Ryde by 69 to 64, and so won
the “Blanky” competition ; which was good work on
top of a wearisome railway journey of about 200
miles. But if the trip in the train was wearisome
the stay in Sydney was splendid, for the Svdnev
bowlers gave their conquerors a right royal time.
Lacrosse let itself loose on Saturday with
the loud howl of the Yankee aborigine, and when
the dust cleared away it was discovered that Sydney
had outed the mermen from Manly bv 11 goals to
three. Petersham made a hash of the'haughty gang
from Burwood by nine goals to three. Mosman and
Birchgrove journeyed to Sydney Domain to settle
their difference, but discovered that all available
space was already occupied by young Australia, and
were, perforce, obliged to put away their onion nets
and tell weird tales about girls they used to know.
Altogether, Sydney, once known as the city of parks
and poverty, finds that it has not half enough open
spaces for the rising generation to stretch its muscles
in. _ There’s an opening for some budding State
politician to earn deathless fame bv devising a
method to endow Sydney with about 10 more recrea-
tion grounds within easy reach of the residential
portions of the metropolis of Congestion.

BAD ROADS
«!► and
COST of MOTORING
You know what an influence
bad roads have on the running
cost of a Car, particularly as
regards tyre upkeep. You can-
not alter the road conditions,
but you can reduce your tyre
bill very considerably by using
DUNLOP
TYRES
which are specially constructed
to withstand the rough roads
in this country. On the fine
European roads poor quality
tyres may give a satisfactory
mileage, but not in this country.
Here you must have ample
strength and durability in your
tyres if they are to give a big
mileage and keep down runn-
ing cost of your Car, and that’s
why it pays to use “ Dunlops,”
the tyres that consistently give
such great wear on our roads.
If you don’t use "Dunlops”—try them!

“J.G.” : This is a sample of the fair deal
the Loafing party gives the Labor party. A
week or so back the Confusionist candidate
for Corio (Vic.), one Ivendell, dropped into
a one-horse, one-pub village, called Bever-
idge, which has the distinction of holding the
Merriang Shire Hall. As Kendell had come
along to bless Cook and curse Fisher, the
overjoyed councillors fell over each other to
welcome him as the savior of their cow-
sheds. The Shire Hall was thrown open to
him, and he spouted his spout therein, no
charge being made for the use of the rate-
payers’ premises. About a week afterwards
Ozanne, the Labor member for Corio, ar-
ranged to address the electors in the same hall
that was given to Kendell free of charge.
But when the councillors were asked for the
use of the spider-infested building the coun-
cillors professed not to know Ozanne from
an ink bottle; they said that before the
premises could be handed over to him, three
ratepayers would have to present a petitioh
or something to the council, saying that he
was a respectable person, and was not carry-
ing bombs or other pleasant things in his
coat tails. And after this document had
been sniffed at, Ozanne was required to pay
for the use of the structure. On second
thoughts, I don’t wondef at the Fat party
reckoning that, if the Laborites got the
powers they ask for, they would make it hot
for the other crowd. It apparently doesn’t
itself know any use for power except to
make things unpleasant for the other party.

The Bishop of Bath and Wells writes : “The
value of Formamint as a preventive is
appreciated in this house.”
The Archdeacon of Bristol writes : “I habitually
carry Wulfing’s Fonuamint with me as a
preventive of Sore Throat.”
The Earl of Kilmorey writes : “I am glad to give
niv testimony to the soothing and curative
effects of your potent remedy—Formamint,
with which lam so familiar. As is my
constant practice, I keep one of your brown
bottles on my dressing table.”
How to Avoid Infectious Diseases.
Do you realise that most of the dangerous infectious
diseases, such as Diphtheria, Consumption, Influenza, Scarlet
Fever, Measles and the like, are caused by germs which gain
entrance to the body through the mouth and throat ?
The minute living organisms which produce such diseases
grow and develop like the seeds of plants, and the mouth and
throat form an ideal liot-house for cultivating them.
The scientist, of course, can grow them outside the body,
artificially. For example, a test-tube culture of the germs
which cause Consumption is depicted here ; and also a bottle
of Wulfing’s Formamint—the means which Science has found
to destroy such germs in the mouth and throat, and so protect
us against the diseases which they breed.
T*. WULFJNG \S • j

THE CERM-KILLING THROAT TABLET
These harmless and palatable tablets, contain the most
powerful destroyer of disease germs known to Science. They
dissolve in the saliva, and the disinfectant is thus carried to
every little crevice, chink, or cranny in the mouth, gums,
tonsils and throat. Thus all germ growths are sought out and
destroyed, their spread is checked, their power to do harm is
entirely broken.
As a preventive of infectious disease, Formamint Tablets
should be used daily by everyone, in health or sickness, and
they are particularly recommended for school children, who
are so exposed to infection, especially at this time of the year.
Beware, however, of harmful imitations ; there is only one
genuine Formamint, viz. Wulfing’s, and all Chemists sell it at
2s. 6d. per bottle. Tli£ manufacturers, A. Wulfing & Co.,
17, Bond Street, Sydney, N.S.W., will gladly send you a Free
Sample and an interesting Booklet, if you write to them,
mentioning this paper, and enclose two penny stamps towards
postage.
‘ O.K. : One more reply to “F.C.” should
bring the Flemington Elat discussion to a finish. In
his comparison between the non-paying flatites and
the paying public’s view of the racing, “F.C.” care-
fully dodges the fact that thousands, not hundreds,
of people on the Flat, which is the inside ring of the
course, can get a close, right-up-to-the-rails view of
many races, particularly jumping races, at points
where the horses’ colors are barely distinguishable
through strong field-glasses to the faraway paying
public. If “F.C.” chooses to place himself in the
back row of a dense crowd, right opposite the win-
ning-post, and then complains that he can see no-
thing of the horses, I would beg him to try and
understand that thousands of people on the Lawn at
Flemington on a Cup Day have just the same cause
for complaint. As to the inconsistency of “F.C.”
and his co-barrackers for the freedom of the Flat—
some of them complaining that they can’t see the
races, whilst others state that it isn’t the races they
are worrying about —I have already said enough.
But seeing that “F.C.” questions the club’s rights,
and the Premier’s right to admit those rights, and
says, “Anyhow, somebody might advantageously pour
a lot of light on this subject,” I will be the pourer
of as much light as there is to pour. In 1871, when
the Melbourne Cup was already beginning to be
talked of as an all-Australian or federalising event,
the V.R.C. became anxious about its tenure of the
Flemington ground, and a V.R C. Bill, which gave
the club a 99 years’ lease of the property for public
racing and racehorse training purposes, was read in
the State Legislative Assembly. Hansard records of
the proceedings show that the only critical comment
on the Bill came from Mr. Vale, who suggested that
some portion of the land should be free to the public.
Nobody said ditto to Mr. Vale, nor did any Minister
reply to him. The House evidently reckoned that
the V.R.C. was doing good advertising work for
A ictoria, and had proved its fitness to be granted
control of the land. The only question raised in
committee was whether the premises might be used
for reviews, and the then secretary (Mr. Bagot)
said it all depended on the state of the weather. A
review on a very wet day would cut the course to
pieces. The V.R.C. Bill was passed in September,
and came into force in November, 1871. The Select
Committee, in its report to the House, made no men-
tion of any suggestion, understanding or promise
of free admission to any part of the property. Some
20 years ago men used to walk from Footscrav to
Newmarket, across the V.R.C. ground, and they
wore a narrow path in the turf. When tackled by the
club officials, they demanded right-of-way, and finally
a friendly law suH was arranged at the club’s ex-
pense. The champions of the right-of-way lost the
suit, as a matter of course. Some years later the
club—which all the time had been leaving the Flat
free, with the shrewd business object of increasing
the popularitv of thq famous Cup, conceded to the
public a walk along the Saltwater River, off the
racecourse, and converted some superfluous high land,
north of the Members’ Drive, into a public park.
Trees were planted and seats placed on it. The
Footscray Council, at about that time, wanted some
of the land beyond the racecourse for a public park,
and the club let the council have a tract of the im-
proved property for a fourth of its market value.
The V.R.C. has been an absolute boss of the whole
property for 42 years. For most of that time it
was good business policy to run a free Flat, even
as an hotelkeeoer runs a free luncheon. Now the
time is more than rioe for demanding of the flatites
the same “bob” admission which they part up cheer-
fully to the V.A.T.C. and other big racing clubs
everywhere, whose land is not a freehold. What is
there more to say ?
“0.K.” : The intense toryism of the pow-
ers that be in cricket is frankly confessed by their
latest reform bill. Public interest in the game as
a gate-money show has been steadily declining for
years past because, life seemed too short for it. On
a wet wicket the batsmen came and went quicklv
enough-—if the bowlers were allowed to get at them.
But, as a rule, wet turf meant a rainy day and a
suspension of the game. Or, if the sky was blue,
the wicket was said to be unplayable, and the game
was suspended to give the ground time to dry. An
unwet wicket meant, in the ordinary way, a dull,
slow game, because the bowlers couldn’t hit the
stumps often enough, or tempt the batsmen to hit
the ball up and give chances to the fieldsmen. There-
fore, the public wearied of cricket matches under
existing conditions. The public wanted taller and
broader stumps, not to mention a somewhat smaller
ball; so that the bowler’s chance of hitting the
stumps whenever he “beat the batsman,” would be
greatly improved. The one thing the public did not
want was an enlargement of the “leg before” rule,
which would necessarily put the batsman more than
ever at the mercy of the umpire, and might result in
a whole side being given out l.b.w, unless the experts
ceased to stop certain balls with the pad and blocked
them with the bat instead. Obviously, the ball that
can be deliberately stopped by a padsman with im-
punity, can be almost ©r quite as easily stopped by
his bat when he cultivates the new habit. It is the
same old ball, and the exact same old wicket is be-
hind him. Given the same ball, or a fractionally
smaller one to play at, with a larger wicket to de-
fend from the attack, and the game would at once
gain in interest for the spectator. The cricket
authorities are opposed to this inevitable reform, be-
cause it would compel the batsmen of the present
day to abandon their cherished cut-and-dried rules
of procedure. A radical change of play would be in-
troduced. The new generation would adapt their
systems or “art” of batting to the new conditions.
Torvism hates radical changes. The very thought of
(say) a four-stumps wicket moves Toryism to scorn,
seeing that our forefathers established the rule of
three. So Toryism, forced by financial considerations
to propose some sort of cricket reform, suggests a
new law of l.b.w. more unsatisfactory to the public
than the existing law. Can it conceivably make the
game more lively for the onlookers? Can it possibly
shorten the length of a game except by increasing the
proportion of batsmen who would be got out in an
objectionable manner ?
N.S.W. Cyclist Union, at its annual meet-
ing the other night discussed the question of sending
an Australian rider to compete in the great road
race at the next Olympic Games. Two great finds
have to be made —first, the man and then the money
with which to send him. The man must be a real
Champion of champions; no ordinary “good” rider
will do. He must be a real, dyed-in-the-wool flier.
As he will take some discovering and developing, it
is proposed to start looking for him right away. As
for the money, it is thought that if a start were
made immediately, it should be possible, by the
year 1916, to have enough in hand to send the man
in a proper manner. The 1916 Olvmniad will take
place at Berlin, where Kaiser Bill eats his sauer-
kraut.
The Titanic must be a very rusty wreck
by now. but the last faint echoes of the in-
quiry that followed the smash still rumble
in the small print of the shipping column.
Last week it was stated thrt British ship-
owners had received, “with considerable
satisfaction.” the statement that the U.S.
Government would accept the new British
Board of Trade rules as to life-saving appli-
ances as equivalent to their own, so far as
ocean-passenger steamers were concerned.
But public interest in the important subject
of life-saving at sea fell down dead long
ago, and few men besides those directly in-
terested will again think seriously about
boats, belts or rafts, until another bad wreck
tests the allegedly increased safeguards. The
only guide the casual traveller has to go by
is the British Board’s proved incompetence,
as instanced by the Titanic horror, and the
way “boat drill” is attended to on most
steamers. Writer recently travelled on an
Australian coastal boat, which, according to
one of the crew, has never put a lifeboat in
the water since he had been in her. Once a
month or so, they have “stations.” Then, at
the whistle of command, the man who makes
the beds and the bloke who peels the pota-
toes and casts the rind into the sea, amble
to the boat deck and range themselves by
their respective life-sieves. Presently the
hawk-eyed captain strides along, picks out
the potato artist at random, and asks him
sharply what he has to do when the bleak
hour comes. The potato man replies respect-
fully that he will be lowered with the tub,
or that he is to assist with the bow tackle,
or that he will commit bigamy, or forge a
cheque, or something. The captain nods
curtly, and moves on to interrogate the bed-
maker or the steward, who blows the bugle
at seasick passengers, and tries to make the
half-dead come to judgment in the saloon.
Two or three such inquiries, and the bos’n’s
whistle pipes all hands to their scuffling
jobs, while the moveless lifeboats bake on
the chocks, and the rust and paint clog the
derricks and w'eather-bleached tackle. The
nervous sea-traveller’s best line is to make
for the newest ship on the run. Its boats
are less likely to be wedded to their lofty
roosts with rust and paint than those of the
oldest ship. The crew is probably just as
ignorant about the management of them as
the crew of the more ancient vessel. But
it seems hardly possible that it can be more
ignorant. No man can know less than half
of nothing.
“J.R.”: Why all this mystery anent the
Scott expedition? A recent cable says that
Commander Evans had been interviewed at
Port Said, and had denied certain rumors
about his namesake, the petty officer:—
There was certainly no friction with the rest of
the southern party, and no reason to believe that
Petty-Officer Evans was insane. Possibly he died of
scurvy, but there was no positive knowledge of it. He
was only carried on the sledge on the day of his
death.
But there should have been some positive
knowledge of what he died of, since one of
the party was a qualified medical man. Plere
is a curious admission in view of the persist-
ent assertion that none of the details of the
final tragedy have been deliberately sup-
pressed :
The members of the expedition have not seen five
of the diaries, which have been handed to the rela-
tives of the deceased.
Why were they not retained and compared
with the leader’s diary to ensure that no
detail had been omitted? It is an invariable
rule that private journals kept by members
of exploring expeditions sent out by the
British Admiralty are to be given up for use
in compiling the records of the expedition.
It is not necessary that every member of the
expedition should have access to every other
member’s diary, but, especially in a case like
this, where the leader loses his life, the pri-
vate journals of all the members should be
available to those who compile the final
records: or. rather, there should be no pri-
vate journals, but each member should keep
a daily record of all he saw and did.
“The Religious Editor”: Is the she-
Wowser a more ferocious putter-down than
the male of the species? She is certainly
more reckless, and the way she throws off
statements, challenges and proclamations,
irrespective of statistics, blue books and
things like that, is just amazing. A whirling
female called Mrs. Lee-Cowie^T^T - "
rived in Sydney from Invercargill i'll, ar '
land No-license city where you aVS 0 - 1 '
undertones, so to speak. Mrs t n 111
says (and thereby shows how' mucTw ie
ledge she has escaped), that InvercL-gffi*'
now free from poverty, crime and; 18
alit, Apparently, tfe abolitio^o(T”'

bunions and that full after e , pt
Also, according to
see a drunken man in the street nt
looked for him even.” All drunks’ you
kept under cover until thev are' fit
home —unless they are already at hi .®>
their booted feet on the S nifeh?'
and the empty decanter under the bed ffi
state of affairs being quite satisfactory r,\
the inexplicable Lee-Oowie woman she hit
come across like an ant encumbered with
bonnet and a peggybag to tidy up S V dU
against the Day of Judgment. She hit ,»i
first of all to put down the liquor traffic t
lecturing at drawing-room meetings and
on, giving one week to each suburb. An fl ,!!
from the fact that drunkards are rarely fo „ ,
ni drawing-rooms, it would be the life-work
of oO Lee-Cowies to put down by such ineon
the pernicious female practice of powdering
the nose. But she seems to be illogical
enough to choose bar parlors for lecturing
on that subject. She calculates that will,
the subsidence of the drink traffic, will’gothe
evils of pugilism ( of which she has no first
hand knowledge), surf-bathing (which she
hasn’t seen), and picture shows. She has never
attended an ordinary picture show, but she
says that Mr. Lee-Cowie once attended and
was so overcome that he couldn’t tell’ her
about it until 20 minutes after his arrival
home. On the strength of speechless Pa's
denunciation, she has started out in her earn-
est, futile way to put down this and several
other things of which she knows nothing. It
seems a pifiv that no cheerful sinner ever in-
formed her that Kosciusko was a vice pecu-
liar to Australia. Then she would have
added the tourist’s mountain to her list of
things to be “put down.” A lot of highly
moral ants must have bitten in their time at
the base of the age-defying Pyramids, under
the delusion that they were sins of a pecu-
liarly obstinate sort. Finally, the most
interfering woman in Australasia asserts
(Sydney Sun. 22/4/T3), that "we are
becoming a nation of lust and immorality
because we have too much luxury and olea-
sure.” There will be a brighter outlook for
our salvation “when he have to work 50
times harder, and have no spare time to
attend picture shows, prize fights, or go
surf-bathing.” So, after all, it isn’t cheap
labor that is our ruin ; it is all due to clean-
liness, exercise, fresh air, leisure and pros-
perity. AVhy does the fussy holy person always
urge, by implication, the advantages of dirt,
flabbiness, stuffiness, hard work and poverty?
Also, wouldn’t Mrs. Lee-Oowie be perfectly
angelic, if she had to do 50 times more wash-
ing and ironing, and had less time to attend
to the business of the wide world? Mrs.
Lee-Cowie indicates one of the curious
defects of womenkind in general. A woman
must either have a household and regard it
as her world, or have the world and rpgard
it as her household, to be swent, and l : «sed,
and spanked at her own sweet ’mil. While
she’s alive, she’s going to raise a dust some-
where.

ANTINEURAATHIN
TREATMENT OF
NERVOUS AND WASTING DISEASES.
The wonderful properties of Antineurasthin (Leci-
thin in an absolutely pure form) for successfully
treating all nerve maladies, Dyspepsia, Anaemia,
Rheumatism, etc., and imparting permanent mental
and nerve force, reflect the latest and most important
achievements in medical science.
One of the most important of the wonderful re-
sults obtained by this treatment is that not alone
does it build up the nervous system by feeding the
brain and nerve-cells with their natural food ele-
ment, but on account of its beneficial action upon
the process of nutrition and upon the blood, the
whole general health shows prompt improvement,
particularly in wasting diseases.
A FREE TRIAL.
In order that the worth of Antineurasthin may be
tested, a sample supply, together with a treatise on
nervous maladies, will be forwarded to any address

W.W. (W.A.) : Appears to be a matter
for local disturbance —in the meantime, anyhow....
J. C. Angus: Thanks, but the item from the Scottish
paper is stale now. In any case, the yelp of the
immigrant from Aberdeen, who failed to get his
hands on to Australian bawbees five minutes after
landing, that he had fallen amongst “damned thieves
and rogues,’’ won’t hurt Australians, and may help
to keep other breathless bandits anchored at Aber-
deen W.A.W.: You’re a dashed plumber.....
R.P.G.: Glad to hear you had that purely economic
(and if you’ll pardon us saying so) useless argument,
but keep us out of it. We’re trying to be busy ... -Con-
stant R.: Well, where’s the joke, supposing Jim Page,
M.H.R., does claim that during Labor rule the mar-
riage and birth rates have been unusually high and
the death-rate unusually low ? When Bill Smith,
who has been clerking at 32s. 6d. per week, gets a
job in a new factory and makes 63s. a week, lie
naturally thinks of a Mrs. B. Smith, and there s
something wrong if the birth-rate doesn t presently
respond. And little Smith has a much better chance
of pulling through its teething when Bill gets 63s.
a week than it would have had if William had
chanced it and married on his old 32s. 6d. . . . .
The Ancient Pro.: Dunno. By the way, can you tell
us who was “on the door’’ of Heaven before Peter
got the job? The problem has been worrying us for
quite 2min O.M.: The poem in which appear the
words, “When Joe Golightly, very rightly, stabbed
him in the spine,’’ is in “Arthur’s,’’ by Neil Lyons.
. . . Reader: Our frank opinion of the pamphlet, “Reme-
dies for the Present Discontent,’’ is that it is asinine..
Freda O.: Some of the verse is very good, but we
can’t stand item re Ananias. Ananias, so far as we
know, onlv told one lie—nothing else is recorded
against him. He was a wildjy gepetras man who
was giving away money, his ne being to the ettect
that, in his mad extravagance, he was giving away
all his money, while he was really keeping a trine
back to buy boots with. There is hardly a drapery
shop-hand in Sydney who doesn’t do the Ananias act
at least once a day, as a matter of course in order
to save his job. This paper doesn’t actually admire
Ananias, but it regards him as a shamefully ill-used
Jew W r .O.K.: George Reid number sold out....
Miles: Too late; and pretty dull, anyhow. Bel-
lerive: Printing your “Remarks” for the information
of readers: “Tragedies, Death-bed scenes, Brawls and
Haunted houses, etc., are doleful subjects to Dwell on
and the art of turning ghastly incidents into verse is
neither cheerful nor Simpile, but I’m attached to my
Art and possess Vivid inspiration, which aids my Task.
Wanderings, hardships and bitter Trials as blighted
my life, but never the less I endeavour to do my
best under' the circumstances: —
A STORMY NIGHT IN THE SLUMS.
The Mongolians closed their window
And listened to the sound
Of the beating rain and whistling winds
Which fiercely raged around
Huddled within their hovels
With their oriental chums
Fan tan was suggested while
The storm raved o’er the slums
Within an alley habitation lay a
Rag picker’s dying child
While the peltering rain descended
And the wind did waileth wild
Piteously mourned the wretched father
With two sympathetic chums
Waiting the arrival of a doctor
While the storm raved o’er the slums.”
. . . . H.T.O.: The poem practically blows up in the
second verse and scatters its fragments over the
countryside... .W.R.B.: Axe-marks all over it. A
rough product... .N.F.: An unsigned, indelible pen-
cil poem about blowflies is about the last contribu-
tion before Chaos sets in. Go to the basket!. .. .
Kid: No use Whatever for Village Blacksmith paro-
dies I.H.: “Young Man’s Song” rejected without
remorse Unknown Contributor: “Pedagogue”
heaved over the battlements at,the German band....
C.B.S.: No; feeble humor in parody form doesn’t
cheer us up on a wet day... .R.W.C.: An old line of
literary goods, and you, haven’t sufficient skill to
handle it Wallie'B".: Spelling is the only original
thing about it.... Amos M.: Promising theme, but
poor verse. Also, where are your name and address ?
A.A.: Well, if you hadn’t tied yourself up in
knots by using only one rhyme throughout each of-
the first two verses, you might have managed to say
more; you might also have been more humorous.
Can’t say for certain, because we don’t know how
much you know, or how. humorous you are. Don’t
feel inclined to go any deeper into the poem ; for
one thing, it isn’t'worth it. (P.S. —Nearly forgot
to call your attention to the fact that “whack”
doesn’t rhyme with “fat.”) H.W.D.: Your senti-
ments do you credit, but the verses really are not
worth a d —n W.W.R.: Verses trip along to a
tame conclusion. Conclusions should mostly be as
wild and unexpected as a hungry zoo Jack A.L.:
Too labored —it sweats at every pore Cadonia:
Cheerful enough, but only worth a par at most....
W.B.D.: (1) If you. are genuinely interested, that is
to say, if you are about to indulge in a marriage-
office wife, The Bulletin’s Past Grand Barmaid
may investigate. (2) A reverend of that name and
address is honorably recorded in the Sydney Direc-
tory ; but, then, of course, the people in the Direc-
tory are very mixed..;. J.’ Edward <M.: Another con-
tribution like that and we will speak to you harshly.
.... Spook : Back to your graveyard ! Parcae:
Hopeless as a wet Sunday Bro: “Bush Girl’s
Song” is cheerful and breezy, but too rough. Most
first tries are rough without either being cheerful or
breezy... .W.H.K.: The boomerang fairly whizzed to
the basket Tom P.: Might be saleable elsewhere i
but we have our doubts... .E.R.: You want a de-
tailed snort? Well, the central idea is a literary
antique, and you have bagged it up anyhow in thread-
bare phrases. The construction of the sentences is
poor, the punctuation baffling, and there is at least
one break in the spelling. How did the convict
know the lady’s swelling bosom was also aching?
She hadn’t spoken to him. Then what do you mean
by this: “James Faber gave himself for lost”? You
probably meant to say, “gave himself up for lost.”
It is a battered old phrase, anyhow John S.:
There must be some good points about being dead, or
so many people wouldn’t have tried it. Most people
are dead, and most people have been dead most of
the time. After reading your contribution we urge
you to go and be dead. Be in the fashion. Why
be a back-number when you can be buried for

TO ARTISTIC (AND INARTISTIC)
CORRESPONDENTS.
J.M., jun.: You are sentenced to learn drawing for
10 more years without the option. .. .S.T.: Mother-
in-law joke is in hospital, having a good, long rest.
.... Mack: They have all started on the return
journey... .P.S.: The Sal. Armv’s converted drunk
has only two drawbacks: (1) He has been done so
often; (2) he has relapsed so often....The Person
Who Sent In The Picture About a Heavy Jew Fall-
ing': (1) None of the sketches are any good. (2)
The joke about a heavy fall of Jew was copyrighted
by the late Ephraim Zox, of Melbourne and the
white waistcoat, and we wouldn’t like to disturb
his good old Hebrew bones by stealing his jest.
(3) No name or address A. Thompson: Four
sketches representing four male persons, of assorted
sizes and ages, gazing at four female ditto. They
are not sufficiently bad to be classed as horrible; on
the other hand, they are well outside the five-mile
publication limit. .. .C.G.D.: That jest is older than
many ivy-clad ruins. . . .Rupert E.: Public house pic-
ture rejected. Now that the cold weather is coming
in the public thirst isn’t so violent as of old. . . .
Mandel: Sorry, but this is a familv paper, which
tries to keep itself unspotted from the world. And
your picture suggests three separate sins—fo"r if the
nose and the bottle counted as two... .Bell: Failed

brickbats, sewer pipe, terracotta, glass, quartz, phos-
phate rock, sandstone, gravel, tile crockery, flint,
manganese ore, oyster shells, stove lining, shale and
all other refradlory materials.
Made in Six Sizes.
The various sizes are made with a view of meeting
the requirements of the small, medium and large
consumer.
Crushing and Pulverising to Fines.
Those materials of a refradlory nature can be fed to
the machine in 3in. to 6in. cubes and smaller.
#§r
The several degrees of fines are secured by installing Grate Bars containing interstices of various widths. A measured
degree of fines is secured by running the materials over a given mesh screen, returning the rejections to the Pulveriser. The
coarser the grind the greater the tonnage capacity, while the finer the grind the smaller the tonnage capacity. The more
dry the material is made, the faster and finer the machine will pulverise.
Strength and Durability.
Careful observations, based upon adtual experience, have resulted in adding to and making extremely strong all parts
of the machine. Extended research and grinding tests year in and year out have brought about the use of Manganese Steel,
a metal that will best resist abrasion and withstand the greatest impaCL

LONDON : 73 to 81 Regent Street, W.; and 19 to 21 Hatton Garden, E.C.
Vegetable Creek (N.S.W.) is at a critical
point in its career. So far, it has mostly benefited
the pocket of the man who sits heavily on the pro-
perty and draws a killing royalty. The co. has been
scratching hard to save the weary shareholders from
too frequent calls. The necessary policy has been
to open up as many working faces as possible, when-
ever cash permitted. Latest advice is that the gross-
cut from the third shaft sunk (Allen’s) has struck
the outside edge of a body of wash, going 501 b. per
yard, but it is too early yet to predict what the
new find is worth. However, this much seems to be
clear, that, if a few decent patches are not discov-
ered from this shaft, which is nearest the scene of
the rich yields of the early days, the future of the
lower portions of the bed will look decidedly glum.
The Coppabella (N.S.W.) silver-lead-zinc
mmes have been re-leased by a Melbourne syndicate
which intends to do some prospecting. The lode is
reported to be wide, and assays are glorious, and as
the show is only eight miles from the Murray River
and 30 miles from Germanton, the conditions for
cheap working are unusually good. What is wanted
is a mine. It is always good to have a mine about
the place.
Eleanora (Hillgrove, N.S.W.) has treated
64 tons of ore for a return of 81oz. of gold bullion.
This crushing was obtained from the winze which
has now connected No. 7 with No. 8 level. There
was an average of 6ft. of lode material in this winze
for a depth of 74ft., and the average value is estimated
at loz. per ton. But the official report stated that
only 61 p.c. of the ore was suitable for milling. No.
8 level has been rather disappointing, for the assays
(15dwt. per ton) are below those obtained in sink-
ing the winze, and the ore in No. 8 level doesn’t
appear to be so heavily impregnated with antimony.
No. 9 level has been driven 37ft. north-west, but
assays are rather low (Bdwt.). “The hoisting facili-
ties are barely able to deal with the waste rock that
is produced from development work” sums up the
situation.
“Kobbi”: The Silverspur (Q. ), the co.
whose property camps near the sliprails that let the
State Frights to and from N.S.W., has just con-
cluded a further annual meeting. But the report
would not cheer a tottering shareholder. In the
early part of the year a drought came in and de-
manded free board and lodging, and the visitor
stayed such a time on the premises that smelting
operations had to knock off. Then a lawsuit about
a man “who departed this life,” so to speak, on the
premises, happened along also, and the lawsuit won.
And a co. which is chasing an elusive lode, as the
Silverspur co. is, can’t afford lawsuits. In fact,
Silverspur is not too sure that it can afford any-
thing just at present. The value for matte for the
year runs into only £12,058 ; the previous year it
was £18,250. An English gentleman, according to
the directors’ report, has taken a six months’ option
over the mine, thinking that, with improved
methods, a better job can be made of the extraction
of the metals —gold, copper, silver, lead and zinc.
The directors appeal for a railway to link their show
tip with Inglewood, and reckon that it would make
dividends possible. But at present Denham has not
as much as a toy track to give away.
Charters Towers is rather disappointed
at the Papuan’s crushing from the Moonstone reef.
The last lot (411 tons for £2859) is a slump com-
pared with the previous return of 262 tons for
£2981. The mine, in order to increase its stoping
area, has had to push out its levels to the north-
east, and the reef in that direction isn’t over rich.
The deepest level (No. 4), at 158 ft. to the N.E., has
2ft. of low-grade stone in the face. The driving
of No. 2 N.E. has also been resumed, and the reef
at the end shows an improvement.
New Queen Cross, Charters Towers, owes
its good fortune to the rich vein on the hanging-
wall side of the Moonstone formation, but one good
crushing and the development of one shallow level
don’t ipake a mine, any more than one swallow makes
a dinner. The fact that stone worth £l2 per
ton was left untouched for over 20 years, although
in close proximity to old workings, just illustrates
the luck of the game, and more particularly the
luck of the Queen Cross.
* * * *
“Kobbi” : Central Bananaland’s two chief
coal mines seem to be drifting apart like the “two
little girls in blue.” Blair Athol, which has a long
stretch of railway to trundle its coal over, has just
handed another sixpenny dividend to its owners
(100,000 shares in all), which brings up its return to
the shareholder to a total of ss. 9d. The output
for the quarter which has just been pushed to the
rear was 20,999 tons. The Bluff, which has the ad-
vantage of being nearer the sea, is somewhat handi-
capped in point of quantity (at least), and has just
been tapping its owners on the shoulder for the loan
of “a bob” on the 6000 newly issued shares, which
have now been called up to 6s. out of the £1 due.
This scribe opines that the Bluff made some wild
mistakes in the beginning. For instance, when the
Bluff was in reality the only black horse in the field,
it wasted its feed, so to speak, by attempting to coke
a non-coking coal. After that it hunted about the
neighborhood to gather up sundry coal shows, and
wasted its estate in proving the worth of these
odds and ends. And they were not worth much as
thimrs have turned out. Another show in the coal
hunt, which ought to make itself heard before long,
is the Newcastle Coal Cos., outside of Blair Athol.
It is credited with 40ft. of fuel at 133 ft., and is now
only waiting for the small branch line to be com-
pleted, when the co. will commence to hit the con-
sumer with the usual “best coal in the world.”
Another month ought to hear the thud.
Jack McDermott, for 6i years superin-
tendent of the Sons of Gwalia (W.A.), has been
given the management of the Cam and Motor gold
mine, Rhodesia (Africa). Th's show is one of a
group bossed by the Goldfields Rhodesia Develop-
ment Cos., and is alleged to be practically a virgin
property, with over a million and a half in sight.
F. A. Govett, an ardent admirer of McDermott, is
on the Board, and this probably explains how he
got the job. As an underground man, McDermott
had few equals in Australia, and probably no
superiors. When it came to treatment, however, he
was not brilliant.

“Quarry Hill”: The legal manager’s game
is not what it used to be. During the infancy of
the gold industry, and then of the silver industry,
and next of the copper industry, the legal manager
got fine chances to make money, and he generally
took them. Besides getting a good wage from each
co. he managed, he was always on the ground floor,
and sometimes on the basement below that, in good
“floats.” In those days brokers were allowed to pay
him half commission on any scrip orders he sent
them, and during the silver boom such business
mounted up to dizzy figures. But the Stock Ex-
changes, greedy for lucre, stopped all rebate com-
missions, and half the legal manager’s income was
swept away. Then gold mining began to slither
down hill.”and its journev does not seem finished.
Look at the dead goldfields of Victoria—Rutherglen,
Steiglitz, Elaine, Stawell, Pitfield. Clunes, Creswick,
Wood’s Point. Jamieson, Smvthesdale, Scarsdale,
Malmsburv, Maldon and Walhalla. Bad management
and Stock Exchange gambling are not wholly re-
sponsible for this decadence of mining. The writer
believes it is due largely to the departure for Tophet
or Heaven of the first generation of mining men of
grit, imagination—and ignorance. Their sons hold
the dollars and lack the ambition to grab more.
Also, they are short of pluck and not so big in their
ideas. They hate pain and discomfort, and love
motor-cars and girls. And roing down a mine is
dirty work and a little dangerous. So mining lan-
guishes from want of broad-minded investors and
big-minded men. Incidentally, it languishes because
you can’t dig the same lot of gold out twice.

ALTONA!
Melbourne’s Coming . .
Garden Seaside Suburb.
A magnificent town-planning project by which it is proposed to convert
2500 acres of ideal building land, having 2]/i miles of beach frontages,
at ALTONA, near Williamstown, into a Model Seaside Suburb, and
to provide all facilities for Continental Bathing; in short, to create
An Atlantic City for Australia.
AN IDEAL BEACH.
Nowhere around Melbourne is there a beach so well suited to this purpose as
at Altona, where for over two miles there is a natural esplanade and hard, shelving
sand (no mud, stone or seaweed), with good deep water.
■***»s&
I
a
a«SS*
THE ALTONA HOMESTEAD,
above pictured, is situatfed right at the beach, and shows the possibilities of the
soil for the making of ideal gardens. Mr. H. T. Howard, the Sydney surveyor who
designed the garden suburbs of Sydney, has published the statement that he has
never yet had one-tenth of the natural advantages to work upon that Altona
possesses.

A WONDERFUL FEATURE OF ALTON A
is that everything is all ready, as though Nature had so designed it, for the planning
of a model suburb. There is an abundant supply of blue metal for road making,
.stone for foundations, clay, sand, cement and lime for brickworks, coal for generat-
ing power, light, etc., and the best soil for gardens. There are several plantations
of fine ornamental trees, including tamarisks, Moreton Bay figs, pines, firs, box, etc.

A SPLENDID PIER,
1300 ft. in length, is already at Altona, and the company propose to take advantage .
of it to create a ferry service between St. Kilda, South Melbourne, Port Melbourne,
Williamstown and Altona. Before long an excursion to Altona, for bathing and
fishing, will be considered one of the greatest delights that Melbourne can afford.

THE EASY ACCESSIBILITY
of Altona will be one of its greatest features. As a rule new suburbs are severely
handicapped, in their early years, through want of proper transportation facilities.
Altona already has the advantage of t!wo lines of railway, one the Government line
from Melbourne, via Newport, and the other consisting of three miles of railway
junctioning with the Government line at the Williamstown Racecourse platform.
The also proposes to negotiate for the construction of an electric tram-
way from Prince’s Bridge to Altona, via Port Melbourne and Williamstown.
mm
Wm PPPIP^
THE ALTONA COLLIERIES
are well known, and this great industry alone would justify the creation of a new
suburb at Altona. Vast, however, as are the deposits of brown coal, the exploita-
tion of them will be merely incidental to the greater proposition —that of giving
Melbourne a magnificent model seaside suburb. At the same time these collieries
are a wonderful asset. The Melbourne Age says: “A field like that at Altona Bay
might be found capable of yielding enough power to work the whole of our suburban
railways electrically, or > lighting the city and supplying power to industrial
consumers.”
The PORT PHILLIP ESTATES AND RAILWAY, LTD., is now registered to carryout this magnificent project.
The Company Is fortunate in having secured, as its directing head, Mr. ARTHUR RICKARD, the most successful and
progressive subdivi-sional expert in Australia.

IN BANANA LAND
Quite an identity was old Peter Mcßorie,
of Bundaberg, who handed in his checks the
other day. Peter was one of the early
Labor battlers in Southern Queensland, and
accqmpanied William Lane in his Para-
guayan pilgrimage. He was prouder, though,
of the fact that he had fought beside Peter
Lalor at Eureka. Thanks to the cursed
Northern climate, he was cut off in the very
act of sprinting into his 80th year.
„ The rich landlord is the true natriot.
Unlike the wicked workman who strikes
against the Government, he never tries to
take his country down for a bean. There was
a sample case of this in Central Queensland
the other day. Three acres were wanted
for railway purposes, and the owner de-
jnanded £4OO for the lot. The vile Govern-
ipent offered £6O. After argument the
owner said he would stand the loss and take
£2OO. The absurd Government still offered
£6O. Then the matter went to the Land
Court, which took evidence, and said that
£35 was plenty.
At last Rockhampton sees in front of it
a comprehensive water scheme. In the
years gone by it has drawn its juice (more
or less mixed with other stuffs not usually
sold by the gallon) from adjacent lagoons,
which had a habit of drying up when thev
were most wanted. Now Rockhampton
hopes to get its liquid from the Fitzroy
River some 20-odd miles up. The council
paid a hurried visit to Treasurer Barnes
the other day to ask him for a loan of a
trifle; to be exact, £125,000. The gentle-
man promised the necessary cash, where-
upon the deputation went out and bought
itself something out of a bottle. It reckoned
it might be disappointed over the water, so
it decided to make dead-sure of the whisky.
In the fight for places in the Reps, and
the Senate, Queensland Liberals have put
up three ex-Labor men —John Mann for
Herbert; David Hunter, for Oxley (the m&n
with the big voice and the not so big intel-
lect) ; and the ever-ready James Michael
Cross, for Maranoa, who is fighting a for-
lorn hope against Page. Cross has had four
tries to re-enter State politics, and he’ll have
lots of other chances if he’s hankering that
way. The Senate election is a straight-out
fight between _ Labor and Liberal, and if
misrepresentation of the Government’s legis-
lation counts for anything, Sayers, Chata-
way and St. Ledger will make a memorable
splash. So, when you come to think of it,
did Jonah when he went overboard. Pretty
nearly half the Mediterranean Sea flew up
when that Conservative nrophet fell in.
[Duncan J. Cameron, Thorn-street, Toowoomba.]
Archibald Meston, director of the Queens-
land Government Bureau in Sydney, got a
body-hold on a Townsville doctor named Nes-
had talked at great length in the
fe. M. Herald against N.Q. as a home for
white men. Meston lived in Queensland for
38 years, seven years of it in the North,
mostly m Cape York Peninsula, where the
wet season is certainly damp. Nesbit talked
wildly ot tropical diseases, and Meston asks
what these are, in view of the fact that
Queensland (next to Maoriland) has the
lowest death rate in the world. Cooktown
has a better climate, says Meston. than
Sydney or Melbourne ; and Frank Jardine, oL
Albany 1 ass, has lived 50 years in the
North, and is “still equal to throwing the
average .man over the fence.” The navvies
who built the Cairns railway did better
work, according to contractor John Robb,
than that done on the Victorian lines,
ihere have been fever epidemics on the
up of new country in Queensland,
and that fact applies to all new countries in
the world. Having finally stated with a
loud whoop of defiance that “Queensland
is a white man s country, and will stay so,”
Meston concludes with the belief that Nesbit
has been abolished.
AN AWFUL TEMTTATION.
LUSHER TIM: "C ome blackeggiN' ter-morrer, Bill!”
BUMMER BILL (scornfully): “ Wot! Not me—I’m union!"
L.T. (with great emphasis): “But, Bill, this is a brewery strike!”
Up North, the bookmaker is in for a cold
time, by the look of things. The other day,
at Townsville, a mob of him and allied
tradesmen were mustered before the Police
Magistrate and fined in varying amounts
from £7 to £lOO per Nose. The threat of
Rhadamanthus as to the altitude of the fine
next time Brian O’Galilee appears in the
worshipful presence was fairly stimulating.
Seeing there is a margin of £5OO to work on,
the Pencillers of Jericho have a chance to
get up arrears of thinking.
“Kobbi” : Something of a typhoid wave has
struck Western Bananaland just lately.
Winton, out towards the sunset, is having a
very bad time of it, with no less than 22
patients in the local hospital, which is a big
record for so small a township. The doctor
has advised “the padlocking of all rain-water
tanks, and the use of lime water for drinking
purposes.” The local bore water has some
considerable heat as it issues from the flow,
and no doubt the germs therein, being boiled
on the immense stove of Providence, are dead
and helpless. At Barcaldine, the other day,
typhoid got into holts with Roxby, one of
the popular Bush Brotherhood in those parts,
and unfortunately typhoid got the verdict.
As a consequence, the fighting Hulton Sams,
who anticipated packing his portmanteau for
England, has decided to unpack for another
year at least, and continue to hustle the
Gospel over the great empty wilderness.
“Good-natured—With Means.”
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
Gentleman, no encumbrance, wishes to
meet healthy gentlewoman, 30 to 40. Good-natured—
with means.— Courier advt.
She need not be millionaire-rich,
She need not be goddess or witch,
She may not have hair like the raven.
Or features like Juno the Queen’s;
She may not be loaded with beauty,
Her voice may not strike you as fluty.
Provided you’re sure when you’ve got her
secure,
She’s soft and good-natured—with Means.
The man who has battled for long,
And buffeted hard in the throng,
Ts apt to care less for high colors,
And tone down the yellows and greens;
No longer he pines for a fairy,
In Polly or Milly or Mary,
Contented were he if his partner could be
J.ust kind and good-natured—with Means.
How potent a tamer is Time—
He'cools aspirations sublime,
The wheat from the straw how he threshes,
And tirelessly tests what he gleans ;
He says to us: “Brothers, he aisy,
The moon’s only meant for the crazy—
Yes —Prissy was pretty, and Winnie was
witty,
But Jane is good-natured—with Means.
And men who get wed to a goddess
May find in the bounds of her bodice
A temper that smacks of old Hades,
And not of Celestial Scenes;
And often I guess they’d surrender
Divinity fair and untender
For just a plain girl with a snub and a curl
Who could be good-natured—with Means.
For loveliness is but a flower
That passes and dies in an hour,
But one thing remaineth to comfort.
And that is—the Magic of Beans !
So, come along freckled-faced Hilda,
Or kindly but stodgy Matilda,
And lend us your hand for a little gold
band,
The meed of—Good-Nature and Means.

My Dear Thargomindah,—
His Ex. and one gentleman fag are mean-
dering about somewhere near Camooweal.
where the local products are largely composed
of dust-storms, Afghans and camels. Lady

Last Wednesday Blanche Philp swapped
her name for that of Henderson, with the
aid of two very pretty bridesmaids, a parson,
a bridegroom and a few other odd accessories.
The wedding dress was white satin, very
dainty, and so plainly cut as to refresh eyes
wearied by much trimming. The ’maids
(another Miss Philp, and a sister of the
groom) wore white, with girdles and hats of
pale blue, and showing cunning touches of
tangerine. Only relatives were at the break-
fast, which was eaten at the Philp residence
at Toowong. The Orsova afterwards con-
veyed the honeymooners south.

in a quite unaccustomed place, and the soup
plates no longer hang on the same nails as
formerly. This comes of leaving a man

hands.

Professor Michie read a paner on “Hieh
land Superstitions” at the Women’s Pink
on Thursday. The club room £ abouV as
commodious as a hen-coop, and when an
audience has finally been extricated, after a
Stirling lecture, it is sometimes necessary to
give artificial respiration to those who were
m the centre of the pack. This has nothing
to do with Highland superstitions, but it
deserves much more ventilation.
Mrs. Downes, head-teacher of the Kan
garoo Point State Kindergarten, has had

with a brooch and a dressing-bag.

The St. George Society, at its annual din-
ner at Ipswich (Q.), was roused to immense
enthusiasm by the reading of a telegram
from the parent society in the Cold Land, to
the effect that “England is watching!” The
idea that Britain stays awake to watch a
gorge in a second-rate Queensland town
delights Ipswich immensely.
The much-boasted benefits of the old Tory
method of settling people on the land, by
buying up private estates at a fancy figure,
and then re-selling to settlers at boom prices,
are coming home to roost. Jimbour settlers,
burdened to death by purchase engagements,
are going to deputationise the Minister for
easier terms. If they do this in the midst
of the present magnincent seasons, what
would they have done after a drought period?
“Kobbi”: The “Never Never” is a fast

half-way to Boulia. And Boulia is so near
the Edge that one holds his breath when he
looks out the back window. The drop is
awful.
The _St. George Society in Brisbane got
something of a shock the other day. At its
annual dinner it called upon Archbishop
Donaldson to propose the toast of “The
Army and Navy”—meaning, of course, the
Army and Navy of “Old England.” But
the Archbishop is a good Australian, and he
did the business in fine style by bidding
Australia increase its own regiments and
hustle along its own navy ; and St. George
gasoed as though it had met the dragon
again, as his Sensible Gaiters hurried along
to wish hearty success to both branches of
his own country’s Defence service.
North Queensland had a drink and opened
another meat-packing factory i few days ago
—at Biboohra, on the railway line that
wriggles out from Cairns to Chillagoe. Or,
rather, it turned the key afresh. For 10 or
12 years the late W. J. Munro owned the
premises and kept them carefully locked up,
because he reckoned they interfered with
his trade as a wholesale and retail dealer in
stock, dead and alive; but on his death ex-
politician C. A. Jenkinson buzzed round,
formed a co. to buy and run the works, and
northern cow-breeders begin to see a better
time ahead.

HOWTO
GROW HAIR
A Simple, Safe and Reliable Way that Produces Surprising Results
new PREPARATION CAUSES BIG STIR AMONG HAIR specialists
h
The above clearly shows Results from a Short Course of my True Halr-Orowlng Compound
10,000 FREE TRIAL BOXES.
Those who are troubled with falling hair, dandruff,
baldness, itching scalp, etc., know full well the
humiliation that they cause. There is no need, how-
ever, of such conditions. These troubles can be
quickly overcome by my True Hair Grower.
I am not an advertising quack, but am a business
man. My hair began to grow thin about the time
I reached the age of thirty. When I had reached the
age of thirty-five the top of my head was quite bald.
I had considerable pride, and sought for something
to cause renewed growth. I invested in every pre-
paration that I could see or hear of, and here let me
say that not only did I try all the English so-called
restorers', but those of Continental Europe. I also
visited specialists. My experimenting cost me many
sovereigns and considerable time —yet the hairs came
not. I had given up the idea of ever growing hair
again. One afternoon, while enjoying a brief busi-
ness respite by an Alpine trip, I fell in with an old
collegiate chemist, whose hair was particularly plen-
tiful. I jokingly remarked that I wished he could
spare some of his hair for my benefit. This lead him
to tell me that he understood the human hair as well
as a good dentist understands teeth. He wrote out a
formula, and suggested that I have a quantity of the
compound prepared. I did this a few days later. 1
was astonished to see the hair coming forth after
several applications, and within six weeks my head
was covered by a firm, yet soft, black growth of hair
Since then the hair on my head has been as luxuriant
as when in my school days. Having arranged for
the legal right to do so, I have for some time been
privately selling this marvellous hair-growing com-
pound. I hold over one thousand letters from people
who have actually grown new hair through the
medium of my true hair grower. I do not pretend
to say it is the only hair grower in the world—l am
not interested in decrying others—but I do assert
that it is the most reliable, and in the end by far the
cheapest.

“Deadhead”: The dignity of the press is well
maintained by the suburban Archimedean lever, as
witness the following, from the Brunswick and
Coburg (Vic.) Star of April 18:
“Occasionally murmurs of dissatisfaction are heard
amongst members of local organisations and pro-
moters of local functions that their affairs are
ignored by the press; and the Fourth Estate unjustly
comes under the lash of criticism. There is another
side to the case, where those who get up these enter-
tainments omit to send the usual complimentary
press tickets. As far as we are concerned, no re-
porter for this paper , is going to explain his position
to a probably sceptical doorkeeper, and take the
chance of being thought mean. If a newspaper is
expected to devote space, time and money reporting
and publishing reports, it is about time amateur
public entrepreneurs learned the regular and cus-
tomary procedure. If, on the other hand, omissions
spring from the supposition that the press would go
and pay at the door, such entrepreneurs merely de-
lude themselves, as the failure to send press tickets
affords the press the best excuse in the world for
getting out of the expense of reporting the event.”
After which the “amateur public entrepreneur”
crawled into his burrow and died, and no one shed
a tear over his remains.
London Times came out on St. Patrick’s Day with
a 32-page Irish supplement. It was quite a departure
from the traditional violently anti-Irish tone and
attitude of the Times. But the old journalistic
steam-roller has got a new editor named Robertson,
and he evidently means to break away from the evil
traditions of the past. The change was emphasised
at the beginning of the first article, “Ireland and the
Empire,” in the Patrick’s Day supplement. There
a handsome apology was actually made for the old-
time animosity of the publication towards the Irish,
and by way of reparation a vigorous protest in verse
from one of the Young Ireland poets of 1848, against
the insults and calumnies of the Times of that period,
was printed in italics. It needed some moral courage
to do that. But assuredly an apology was called for,
considering that the Times, in one of its sober-
minded old moments, addressed O’Connell, the Lib-
erator, as
“Scum spewed out of Irish bog,
Ruffian, murderer and hog.”
Australia got a section of the “Ireland and Empire”
article in the shape of some matter drawn from J.
F. Hogan’s “History -of the Irish in Australia.”
Richard Bourke was described as the greatest of
Irish viceroys, and the inscription on his Sydney
statue was quoted. The Irish “political exiles,” or
transported rebels, were said to have developed into
“good colonists.” Irish literature, Irish drama,
Irish education, Irish manufactures, Irish folk lore,
Irish humor, and a lot of other Hibernian subjects
were treated.

Dear Bulletin, —The newly-elected Sydney Uni-
versity Senate might well consider whether the big
academy should not give a little less prominence to
the teaching of dead Latin and the corpse of Greek,
and make a start with a chair of Living Asiatic
Languages. The future trade of this continent with
China and Japan will necessarily be very extensive,
but, more important is the fact that the Eastern
Asiatic will probably be Australia’s most delicate
diplomatic problem for all time. It is absolutely
necessary that our statesmen should keep a vigilant
eye on the development of the saffron proposition,
and how they are going to do this successfully if
they can’t personally analyse the printed utterances
of the Brown Cove this writer fails to see. Censored
though it may be, the Japanese press of to-day is by
no means an unreliable indication of the trend of
Japanese diplomacy. Neither is its share in the
development of Japan’s policy a negligible one. As
time goes on it is probable that the Jap press will
become enfranchised, and will be as powerful as, say,
the pan-German organs of to-day. At the present
day any educated Mongolian can (and many of them
probably do) read the unpatriotic blather of our
own Australia-hating ' newspapers, and realise the
immense help to be gained therefrom to the infant
nation’s undoing. But, to us, Japan is a closed
book; we can just as readily keep abreast of Japan’s
thought as we can of Tibetan. When we can under-
stand and study our neighbors our inertness will
probably vanish with a unanimity that may even
include Australia’s notoriously unpatriotic press.—•
Yours, etc., Vergniaud.
HYMN TO INK.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
Child of the worm, the oak tree, and the fire,
Naiad of dreams,
Whose black unhairpinned tresses are my lyre,
Making a crooked music of desire
In many streams
Of silent sound .
Flowing my much-corrected paper through,
Until the round
Of this big earth is eloquently drowned
In floods of you.
The worm that was thy father writhes along,
The 6low, base verbiage of the written line,
Eating the green and fluttered heart of song
As days eat mine.
The tree that was thy mother sways and thrills,
Drunk with clear sunshine, in the thing I write,
As when the soft winds to the purple hills
Murmur at night.
For me the flame that gave thee purpose glows,
Fanned by -the light touch of the errant thought—
When God goes fishing thus some star he knows
Burns to be caught.
The mill that made thy blackness into dust
Turns on for me through countless nights and
days—
The poet needs must grind his inky crust
Or eat his bays.
Thou art the pen-kissed bride of striving thought,
Meek as some holy, silence-pickled nun,
Subtle as light, or light’s best rainbow caught
In spring’s green branches when young dreams
are spun
Out of a happy fleece of showers and sun,
Facile to follow fancy, or to deck
Romance with that black blossom, hardly won —
The name that gives its lustre to the cheque.
The white gods, floating free
Down skies of Thessaly,
Live only now in thee;
The pageant of the kings
A spent, far radiance flings
’Mid old imaginings
Thou hast inshrined ;
From records of thy keeping
The bent, grey world is reaping
A harvest like the wind
Of ink-unfettered mind.
But thou, my pen and I,
Till all thy wells are dry
Must still conspire
To work Promethean-wise
Arch-treason to the skies
And steal their fire.
And if we hold and tame
With thy black bands that flame,
Shall Jones and Smith admire our dangerous
plunder ?
Or shall we get abuse
For plagiarising Zeus?
Who knows? I often wonder.
N.S.W.

ARE YOU
DEAF?
If you are deaf, or going deaf, you will be glad to
hear of a simple and scientific device which restores
hearing, no matter how old you are. No mystery or
secrecy about it; we describe it fully, and explain
just how it acts. You use spectacles as sight magni-
fiers, and in the same wav you use this sound magni-
fier to hear better. Unlike spectacles, the Wilson
Common-sense Ear-Drums are invisible and comfort-
able. No one can tell you are wearing them. They
rest the ear nerves by taking the strain off them—the
strain of trying to hear indistinct sounds. What a
relief to have done with that tiring strain. Being
made of the softest Para rubber they cannot be felt,
even when the head rests on a pillow. For the same
reason, a blow on the side of the head will not hurt
the ear. They protect the tender inner parts of the
ear, that are so sensitive, from cold winds, dust, sud-
den and piercing sounds.
So that you may clearly understand how the Sound
Magnifiers restore hearing, we give an illustration of
one as it lies in the ear. You will notice that the
Sound Magnifier is shaped like a trumpet, and so con-
veys even the faintest sounds right to the natural drum.
Being of the softest rubber, it cannot hurt the ear.
It fits the orifice of the ear
with precision and comfort.
The division that runs
across the mouth is to al-
low the removal and inser-
tion of the Ear-Drum, and
to brace it.
The shape of the Wilson
Ear-Drum has been chosen
after years of experience as
the best adapt-
ed to carry the
faintest sound.
Of course, if
you have lost
the h e a r i ng-
nerve com-
pletely, or were
born deaf, we
cannot pretend _ _
to cure you. Only a miracle could
do that, in spite of some of the
absurd claims made to-day. But
of you can hear the faintest sound,
do not despair. You will never
regret trying the Wilson Ear-
Drums. We have letters to show
you from deaf people in Australia
and New Zealand, who have been
a n’ y ° U j Can be ,cured, too. Jon ,7,av wear

Leslie Burrell, a Christchurch Boy, cured by
Dr. Sheldon’s New Discovery

LESLIE
BURRELL,
(from a photo).
“My little boy, four years of age,
was suffering from a very bad cold on
the chest, accompanied by a severe
croupy and chronic cough which would
always leave him exhausted,” writes
Mr. T. Burrell, Victoria Street,
Christchurch, N.Z. “During the at-
tack he would go black in the face,
causing us great worry and alarm.
We tried everything that was adver-
tised and recommended, but it was of
no use. Hearing about how Dr.
Sheldon’s New Discovery had cured a
similar case, I made inquiries and
purchased a bottle for a trial, with
the result that the coughing and
pains in his chest were immediately
relieved, and his health and appetite
were completely restored, and he is
to-day perfectly cured and in the
very best of health, for which I have
Dr. Sheldon’s New Discovery alone to
thank. I hope these few words of
gratitude may cause others in the
same state as my child to give it the
trial it honestly deserves.”

The Last Reserve.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
King Ferdinand and bis Ministers called out not
an army, but a nation. It was a clean sweep of
the nation’s manhood. In the last reserve were boys
of 16 and men past 60 years of age. No one was
spared from the roll-call. Professors and painters,
journalists, merchants, shopkeepers, shop-assistants,
schoolmasters and schoolboys, every kind and condi-
tion of Bulgarian, were summoned in that general
“mop-up” of the national strength. It was cruel,
hut it was also magnificent. For the call was an-
swered with a tremendous enthusiasm, and there
were no evasions, no deserters.
—Philip Gibbs, in the British Review (London).
SAY, what is the thing that wins in war
—is it merely iron and steel?
’Tis the passionate heart at the nation’s
core when the forth-riglit bugles peal 1
’Tis the spirit that leaps in the shop-man’s
breast, that stirs in the school-man’s
soul,
When the yardstick’s dropped and the lines
are dressed, as the drums of the nation
roll!
Professors and painters?— soldiers all! —
editors, smiths and clerks —
Ready and armed, are the short and tall,
when the Maxim splutters and barks!
For this is the Thing that counts in war—
’tis the leap of the nation’s nerve,
When the greybeards march by the hundred
score in the ranks of the Last Reserve !
When cannon have shattered the nation’s
best, and the trenches smoke with
blood,
Then the land must stand to the final test —
or the nation’s name is Mud!
When the shrapnel’s scythe from the dawn
has swung, and the human windrows
lie,
Then the land must answer with old and
young, or its soul must shrivel and die!
For this is the law that the nations all must
break at the cost of death —
Yea, the class must cease and the pen must
fall when the warning bugle saith !
Since the Thing that matters the most in
war, when the shell-flogged squadrons
swerve,
Is the valiant heart in the students’ corps
and the strength of the Last Reserve !
And what will Australia’s answer be, and
what will Australians do,
When the strong man sinks on a failing knee
and the colors are beaten too?
Say, how will the editors answer then, and
how will the shop-men stand?
Will the journalist drop the scissors and
pen for the rifle ready at hand?
Will the merchant dress in the self-same
line, with his dozen of invoice-clerks?
For the schoolboy’s ready at danger’s sign—
but what of these Ancient Narks?
Are the parsons ready, who cant and groan—
are their curates prepared to serve? _
Will each sidesman fight—will he hold his
own with the lads in the Last Reserve?
For this is the Question, after all, that
strikes to the heart of things—-
Will the nation answer the bugle’s call with
a spirit that throbs and swings?
Are the grey professors prepared for war,
as well as the boys at school;
Are the writers ready?—Their written lore
must shrivel when Maxims rule!
For the land that moves on an ordered plan
must call these writers in—
It must arm the poet and artisan, and
the priest and the parson’s kin !
It must base its strength on the Final Line
-—each arc of our manhood’s curve,
The young and the old —they must put their
spine in the strength of the Last Re-
serve !
For the Thing that wins in the time of war
goes down to the roots of faith—
’Tis the passionate heart at the nation’s core
that leaps when the bugle saith!
What spirit shall stir in the shop-man’s
breast, what strength in the schoolboy’s
soul ?
We shall need a church with a martial zest
when the drums of the nation roll!
Our bishops and curates? — -soldiers all! —-
cheering the lads and clerks—-
Ready to march when the bugles call and
the Maxim splutters and barks!
Is the Church prepared?—for its aid we need,
and the leap of the nation's nerve
Ts as strong as Australia's strongest creed —
for the Church is the Last Reserve!
VICTORIA
GRANT HERYEY.
The Professor.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
I AM late, and there is quite a rush for
seats to witness the “Dedication” as
advertised. Indeed, our versatile
professor, clairvoyant healer, psycometrist,
thought reader and what not, is already
adding another facet to his gem-like collec-
tion of talents by acting as priest and nurse
to the weakly, hiccoughing infant who has
the star part for the evening. After wind-
ing up a lengthy vague address on
“Thoughts” and “The Child,” he dedicates
the babe, which, clasped against his roly-
poly form, he seems, till now, to have for-
gotten, to the cause of Spiritualistic Science.
“Beatrice Besant Brown” —he rolls the
alliteration delicately upon Ins tongue—-‘1
dedicate you to the Best in Life—to the
study of the Occult—to the advanced Spint-
u-lism of the present age.” Beatrice Besant
Brown, alarmed at this strenuous prospect,
wails publicly. He tries his mesmeric stare
upon her as a silencer. This stare is a. terri-
fying thing to meet at long range. Its imme-
diate result upon the babe at close quarters
is something resembling convulsions. Here
the mother would intervene, but she is
01 “Be calm, madam,” he says. )( “Your child
is now within psychic control.”
Certainly the infant raises her voice no
more in sorrow. Indifferent alike to several
“bright controls” which the High Priest sees
hovering near, or to the touching with
bolic flowers” which helps to pad out the
ceremony, she sleeps. , „ • *
“I prog-nos-ticate,” says the High Priest,
“that the Spirit of Intelligence will bless
this babe.” He glances ceilingwards
“Intelligence,” obedient to command, is flut-
tering about there. “Yes, a bright light is
dawning over my head, he affirms. -the
be-yutiful Spirit of Intelligence is float-ing
down—down.” His eye follows the descent
and rests at length upon the piano-stool.
‘‘lntelligence, bearing beside her bright light,
her symbol, which, as those of you who
study the occult under my guidance, are
aware, is a scroll. She breathes into this
child a shower of Good Thoughts, which,
lying in her sub-conscious mind, will one
day send forth a harvest of Good Deeds. In-
telligence prognosticates for her a life of
Good —Good —Good.”
His voice, risen almost to a scream, is now
melodramatically dropped a few octaves as
with mesmeric glare he says: “The Aura of
this child shows benevolent rays, bloo and
voylet.”
Soon after he begins to read our “Auras.”
“You can’t take me in,” he remarks, “no
matter how you impose on the man in the
street. Outlining each one of you is the
Aura —the color of which proclaims you
either white-teaded boy or the bad girl of
the family.”
At this unexpected gleam of comedy we
break into laughter. The leader must be a
humane seer. He will not divulge too much
and damage our reputations. Quite the con-
trary. For, by the time he is through with
us we mostly have “swelled head.” In his
delineations we figure as heroic characters.
Even our dubious points are endearing—-
"generous to a fault,” “rashly daring,” “no
one’s enemy but our own,” and the like!
Most of us, too, are “fraught with clairvoy-
ance,” only needing the tutelage of our flat-
terer to develop into first-class psychics and
qualify to “demonstrate,” “function,” and
“go in for reading of the hair.” The only
wonder is that such fine characters as we
should find so little appreciation in our own
homes.
After a silver offering has tinkled into
little glass plates and been borne away by
students of the Occult, the Professor is ob-
served to be in semi-trance. Wedged into
an armchair and muttering stagily, his mag-
netic eye is dulled, yet observant.
“What’s wrong?” I inquire of my next
chair neighbor. “What’s he muttering
about? Is it indigestion or acute dandruff?”
With a pitying glance for my crass ignor-
ance she replies, “He’s en rapport with his
Guide. He’ll be himself again presently.
Then he’ll demonstrate. You here for a
message ?”
“In quest of Truth,” I answer. “Perhaps
a grain of it may lurk even among the
cranks”
“He’s no crank” —indicating the Profes-
sor. “He’s genu-wine. _ Gets marvellous re-
sults. Mater-ialised his Guide once —saw
him do it —a black gentleman he is. Ma-
’ommedan.” I make groans of astonishment
and raise my eyebrows till they disappear in
my hair.
“Yes, indeed,” she resumes. “And won’er-
ful cures by suggestion. Cured my daughter
of depleted nerves when all the doctors
failed.” Again I gnash my teeth and strike
an attitude of amazement. “Spent a for-
tune on doctors for ’er, I ’ad.”
“Apropos of cures,” I whisper, “I am suf-
fering from a depleted purse. Would he try
the suggestion cure on that?” She rebukes
me, base materialist that I am. “Hush
h’sh,” she warns. “You mustn’t joke here.
The spirits don’t like it. I believe there was
a joke made here one night, an’ all the spirits
up and left.”
“What! Touchy as all that? The next
world must be even more unpleasant than I
thought. Some chestnut, perhaps”
An angry hissing from the seats of the
elect silences me.
“He’s starting,” whispers my friend. He
was. He was on his legs, his glittering iri-
descent eye seeming to revolve like a Cather-
ine wheel. He looks at some critics near the
door.
“I am con-scious, friends, of an un-sympa-
tlietic. influence. Some material-istic soul
here is put-ting obstacles in the way of
spirit com-mun-ication. Let us all put good
thoughts in-to the e-vil soul.”
We all do, but they don’t act. For one of
the cavillers, baser than his fellows, and
having no sense of fitness, suddenly sees a
joke that was told him yesterday, and re-
lates it to his evil neighbor, who explodes
into a muffled guffaw.
“Friend, as you are an ass, you had better
make a donkey-slide of the staircase. This
is not a circus,” says the Professor. And
the ass, gathering up his hat and his bray,
goes forth in disgrace. Instantly we feel a
purer, rarer quality in the air, and the Pro-
fessor sees in the aisle a bright spirit.
“A beautiful spirit form, from whom em-
an-ates beams of b-100 and amber. Passed
out recently, she tells me”
Here he interrupts himself to adjust his
cough. “Wo-hoo? Wo-hoo?” He sounds
like an old and faithful hound I once had
that suffered from asthma. “Wo-hoo! Wo-
hoo !” he barks. “She has forgotten the
name she bore while on the earth plane. I
will de-scribe her more fully. She is bright—
—all bright. Fair blue eyes, fair hair” —
“Why does he not say ‘blonde,’ and be done
with it?” I whisper tartly. “How is my
depleted purse to be restored to solvency if
he wastes words like this?”
“Wo-hoo.” (Oh, that he would, by sug
gestion or eucalyptus, cure his cough.) “In
fact, I might describe her as a blonde,” so at
last we come to the point. “A radiant
spirit, this, slightly built, illumined with
soft rays, bearing the light of Wisdom. She
wants _ communi-ca-shun with someone in
the third row. Does anyone claim her?”
The entire row claims her. Yet can she
belong to all? If she is daughter to the
blue-bloused woman at the end, is she also
niece to the red-nosed man by the wall? It
is all very puzzling. Why has she not
brought her card with her? There is some
scuffling and perplexity among the claim-
ants, but the Seer, equal to these emergencies,
gives an explanation which quite contra-
dicts his former remarks about the visitant.
“She tells me, friends, that she is the
Spirit of Universal Sisterhood. That is
how we all recognise and reach out to her.”
We accept the lie tamely, and are intro-
duced to a “stoutish. darkish, baldish” spirit
who blocks the aisle. Nobody recognises
him even when a “jocular manner” is added
as an identifiable detail. Perhaps the
reason is that, by a remarkable oversight,
the Professor has forgotten to equip him
with a “bright light.” How can we claim
a dark spirit—it would look so odd? The
Professor’s is the blame, yet he irritably
throws slurs on our intelligence.
“Is there anyone here who understands
what I’m talking about —who recognises
this stoutish spirit? Wo-hoo! Wo-hoo!”
Stay! A thought arrests me. There was

THE EVER-READY HEALER
AND PERFECT SKIN-CURE.
IN the course of her duties the nurse is
A brought into contact with every descrip-
tion of skin disease. She is also brought
to fully realise the need for a reliable healing
balm which can be applied to diseased and
wounded skin with every confidence that
only good will result.
The fact that hundreds of nurses use
Zam=Buk in the course of their
duties is further proof, if such were
needed, that in Zam-Buk the public
is furnished with a reliable healing
balm and skin~cure, the purity and
power of which cannot be denied.
Below we quote the opinion of three of the many trained
nurses who have written in praise of Zam-Buk.

ZVERV HOME NEEDS A,p or
WOUNDED, INFLAMED HAND
THAT WOULD NOT HEAL.
Nurse Opray, residing at 31 King Street,
Prahran, Melbourne, adds her name to the
already long list of professional practitioners
who speak in praise of Zam-Buk. “I suffered
from a terribly bad hand,”, says the nurse,
‘‘which was caused through knocking it against
a door. Inflammation set in, iny hand com-
menced to swell up, and the pain was so great
I could do nothing with it. 1 was out nursing
at the time, but I was forced to give it up. All
the remedies I tried failed to do any good, and
at the end of three months my hand was get-
ting worse instead of better. A friend advised
me to use Zam-Buk. The benefit I derived
from the first few applications was very encour-
aging. After a while the wound was cleansed
and purified, and the healing process rapidly
set in. New healthy skin grew over the wound,
and my hand was as sound and strong as ever.
I recommend it to all.”
Zam-Buk is a
proved remedy
for eczema, boils,
sores, bruises,
cuts blackheads,
pimples, sore
feet, etc. From
all chemists and
stores at Is. 6d.

Colic , Diarrhoea and Dysentery
Are diseases that require immediate attention. In almost every neighbourhood
someone has died from these diseases before medicine could be procured or a
physician summoned.
Those who rely upon physicians often find that they are away from home when
most needed.
Every family, and especially those who reside in the back blocks, should keep
at hand a bottle of Chamberlain’s Colic & Diarrhoea Remedy.
No physician can prescribe a better medicine for the purpose for which it is
intended. It is invaluable for both children and adults.

The quick relief afforded by Cham-
berlain’s Cough Remedy in cases of
whooping cough makes it a favorite
with mothers of small children. It
liquefies the tough mucus, makes it
easy to expectorate, keeps the cough
loose and counteracts any tendency
for it to result in pneumonia.
COUGH
a gas-rate collector I once knew, with a bad
habit of jocularity. 1 often wished him
dead on account of it. Perhaps this shade
is his.
rut to the chair, so to speak, this very
person it turns out to be. My collector was
tall and hairy and bony, but I take the
shade, with all discrepancies; to my bosom,
and it shows its gratitude by “passing its
hands lovingly over my face” and “breaking
over me a bright beam of light.” Evidently
he js still in the gas business, as witness the
switching on of his hidden illuminant.
But now the Professor wishes all the
Shades “good-night,” and starts curing us
by suggestion. “Anyone needing a curing
current hold up the hand,” we are com-
manded. Most of us do. Among such a
crop of hands even a healer may blunder.
That is why an old man, greatly daring,
disputes a diagnosis. “Twasn’t my hand
you read, sir; I haven’t got a floating kid-
ney. My trouble is chronic poomoanyer.”
“That is what I implied,” shrieks the
Healer. He ignores the mistaken hand’s
accusations. “You had pneumonia. Now
you have it no more; I transmute it for
you.” “Transmute” is a good word. The
caviller goes down before it baffled. Mean-
while, the Healer rushes things. He stares
mesmerically, raises his plump white hands
to a clapping position, and points to a hand,
saying in a loud, threatening voice: “I
affirm that the pain in your back and legs
wall now leave you.” He claps thrice. “One,
two, three ! Gone ! Next!”
He takes on “Next,” saying, as he again
prepares to clap: “I affirm that the dull,
don’t-care, full-up feeling you’ve had ever
since Cup Day will now leave you.” Clap-
clap-clap ! The Healer carries all before
him, curing us now in batches. His “One.
two, three, next,” is hurrying us to the end
of the programme and the last trams. Does
he diagnose correctly? No man knowetli.
We seem to be trodden under foot in the
rush of the hoofs of the prophet.
“It’s not you that’s sick,” he tells us
later, “not the real you, but your old bod-
dies. Concentrate, cast out the e-vil thought
of pain and you are instant-ly well, well;
well.”
It is on buoyant legs, therefore, and carry-
ing our old “bod-dies” at a rejuvenated tilt,
that we at last leave a depleted and wrung-
out Healer to a consideration of the takings,
while we sprint like the very devil for the
last tram.
WEEROONA.
On the Midnight Slow Express.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
I RECENTLY stated in The Bulletin
that as a result of much scientific re-
search I had discovered that the easi-
est way for the beer-dazzled Sydney subur-
banite who lives near the railway to reach
his home safely, and within a reasonable
time, was to wait for the midnight train,
a weary caravan upon which they carry
drunks and discharge them at the proper
place of delivery. Since then I have re-
searched some more, and I want to add that
it is no use seeking safety on the drunks’
train unless you really are drunk. The
sober citizen seems to be regarded as a tres-
passer on the midnight vehicle, and if he
should happen, by the sheer weariness of the
long stoppages on the journey, to drop to
sleep, he may sleep until the train gets to
Parramatta or the last chapter of the Book
of Revelation, but no railway servant will
lift a hand or a foot to assist him, any more
than they would on a common train which
started at 5 p.m.
I, of course, am the sober citizen, and it
seems to me that I have done more unneces-
sary travelling within the last six months
than is good for any man. Wearied out
with business —in a bottle or otherwise —I
may happen to doze, and if I do, I am bound
to wake up at Parramatta, or Clyde, or
Granville, or Penrith, or some other old
Methuselah of a place where there is no
train back till morning, and the pubs are
all shut, and it is cold and dismal, and the
station officials are, sometimes, hard-hearted.
On one occasion I woke up at Penrith, and
a ticket collector looked at me severely, and
spoke about breaches of regulations, and col-
lected Is. 7d. excess fare just so that I
wouldn’t have the pleasure of experiencing
several hours’ unnecessary travelling, and
missing my dinner and an appointment for
the theatre with a lady who might be
annoyed, for nothing. When I did get a
train back, another collector looked at me
severely and collected another Is. 7d. I am
fond of travelling, but travelling beyond Bur-
wood, when I am anxious to get home
within, at all events, two or three hours of
the time I arranged to be there, is not a
pleasant thing to be charged for.
The first time I woke up at Granville,
somewhere about the hour of nil a.in., I
decided to walk home, about eight miles. I
did it, too, after meeting a lady and gentle-
man who wanted to know if it was 10 o’clock
yet, and a wandering spirit outside Rook-
wood cemetery, which proved to be a mile-
stone or something else equally hard, and a
young policeman with very old suspicions.
Auburn or Clyde are convenient places, I
have found, at which to wake up. There
are goods trains leaving the adjacent Clyde
yards at various times during the night, and
reaching my suburb at various times during
next month. I once walked home, also,
from Flemington, thinking it was fairly handy
to my suburb, and after losing myself in the
bush I met a bull which was wearing my hat
when I left it. •
But the most persistent travelling I have
experienced on the suburban railways hap-
pened early this year. I had caught my train
for home shortly after six, and when I woke
up at Granville, I found another train wait-
ing to bring me back again. I must have
mislaid my station again on the way back,
however, for I surprised myself on the Syd-
ney station engaged in a heated argument
with an individual who, for some reason or
another, wanted to tell me that he was
worth £5OOO, and whom, for some reason or
another, I desired to inform that he didn’t
own a cent. When I woke up at Lindfield, I
found I had mislaid my crayfish, so I went
into the Sydney train to look for it, and
woke up at Milson’s Point. I crossed the
ferry, secured another crayfish, had a few
drinks to sustain my failing strength, and
determined upon a fresh start. This time I
woke up at Parramatta, and discovered that
the train I was on was the first train back
in the morning. It was an “all-stops,” and
would undoubtedly have got me home if I
hadn’t wakened up at the Sydney station
again. I reckoned that there was a con-
spiracy amongst the trains to prevent me
getting home after that, so I didn’t try again.
I had spent about 12 hours—let alone two
crayfish—in an endeavor to travel seven
miles or so, and the amount of coin the rail-
way officials who wouldn’t deliver me to the

HAMER.
A Tale of Wet Endeavor.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
IT was the middle of the night
When first we bumped upon the
rock,
The big ship shivered with affright,
The loud seas rose our hones to mock,
And everybody then on deck
Made some remarks about a wreck.
The thing they said was justified
By observations shortly made;
A hole was in the vessel's side
Through which a spouting whale might
wade,
And smaller fishes very soon
Were waltzing in the first saloon.
The girl was beautiful to see,
Her hair like funnel smoke outblown,
Her lips like some red shell that three
Tall waves with foam have shoreward
thrown ;
Her cabin luggage all was gone
And she had very little on.
The situation was not nice,
For we were thirty leagues from land,
all the life-boats in a trice
Were smashed as soon as they were
manned.
Viewing the circumstances round
It seemed we must be shortly drowned.
It seemed a drowning I must share
At midnight in the angry wave,
With that sweet dimpled maid whose hair
Seemed worth a large attempt to save;
But the stern fact was written clear
That we were lost and death was near.
I reallv did not know her name,
We had not then been introduced,
But in that time of wrath and blame
The social bonds were somewhat loosed ;
We felt we could dispense with form
Amid the tumult and the storm.
I took her softly in my arms.
The. wild sea round us seethed and hissed.
The night was full of fierce alarms
And none observed us where we kissed :
We knew we must go under soon,
Yet paused a moment there to spoon.
The situation was absurd,
As everyone must freely own.
We had not said a single word.
Yet now I live for her alone;
The waves our hot love tried to splash.
And all the decks were soon awash.
The ship heeled over with a lurch,
And we were in the angry sea—
The prayers they always say in church
Were small avail to her and me—
And yet she swam about a mile,
And let me kiss her for a while.
Our plight was really rather bad ;
A hen-coop might have saved us then,
But there was nothing to be had
Except a glimpse of dying men.
And over us the seas a-roll,
Seemed washing out her gentle soul.
I said. Dear love, we needs must part.
The angry ocean claims its own,
You really have the nicest heart
Of any girl that I have known.”
And as upon the wave she rose,
I kissed her softly on the nose.
She said, “This parting gives me pain,
But as there is no sort of hope,
Just trv to reach me once again
Before my senses all elope,
For drowning is a kind of bliss
If soothed and softened by a kiss.”
I kissed her on the mouth and brow,
And then a large wave loud and cold
Elimbed up above us like a cow,
And, moo-ing wildly, o’er us rolled
And as its wet weight pushed me down
I knew the time had come to drown.
■Vnd this is where the tale grows sad.
1 drowned as I expected to,
Because no air was to be had
And there was nothing else to do:
But that sweet maid so lately kissed
Amid the wet I somehow missed.
Here, lying on the cold, dank weed,
Mow dreams my fancies set astir,
And all the world of life and deed
T \. e . e ? s , t 0 its limit filled with her;
I think she rode that cow-wave tall
And did not really drown at all.
I dream that sunlight gilds the sea.
And up and down the waves she goes.
'at s °me bold merman swimming free
May pinch her beauty on the toes;
1 see her float like smiling sin
With two sweet dimples on her chin.
In daylong frolic in the wet
She holds a dolphin by the tail,
And when the merry sun has set
Mm sleeps beneath the moonlight pale
Dr mid the laughing star-beams fair
Bets small green fishes comb her hair.
And I am dead as Jonah’s whale.
_Aml she’s alive and bright and well,
Which makes the very saddest tale
ihat any ocean thing can tell;
For I, by death, was taken down’
Because my lady would not drown.
She would not drown, she will not come
Her red lips I shall taste no more- ’
1 erhaps she yields them now to some
Dry .man who brought her to the shore.
But at the bottom of the sea
The small, blue crabs crawl over me.
