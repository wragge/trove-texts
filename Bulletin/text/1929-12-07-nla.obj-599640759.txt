The Red Page
Jubilees, Religious Editors, Etc.
One day "Hop.” met the Great Writer in
the street, "Lend me a quid,” was the
demand. "I’m out on a birthday.”
“Hop" looked at him coldly. "No,” said
"Hop” firmly; “if anyone goes out on a
birthday with my quid—it’s me!”
If that precedent were followed when next
.year The Bulletin goes out on its birth-
day, its fiftieth, honor could not be satisfied
merely by the staff adjourning to the
hicstoric pub near by and having one on the
firm. The shout would have to include
contributors past and present; and there
is ancient authority for the belief that it
would cost a lot of money to buy any sort
of drink where some of them are.
Perhaps a special issue made up entirely
of the "copy” of great names, with editorial
discretions or desecrations withheld, might
loot the bill. Or it might be left to aspiring
poets to do something fitting, such as taking
compassion and an oft-repeated hint and
lor once including either an electric torch
or bismuth with their contributions. Or one
of those urgent lady writers might call and
meet the Religious Editor, and they might
fall in love.
I speak without bitterness, accepting that
the season of goodwill unto all embraces
even Religious Editors. There are a few,
perhaps, who think that the Religious
Editor is a myth, though an urgent young
lady might not think so if the possibilities
mentioned here materialised. Apropos, I
once heard a woman barracker shout at a
rather long-haired footballer, “You’re a
lady !” “That’s all you know!” retorted an
opposition woman barracker, apparently
better informed. The Religious Editor is
like that. He. is no myth; or if he is he
belies appearances. But there is no getting
i‘id of distrust: I know one man who
actually believes that “Bellerive” is a myth.
Of course "Bellerive” is not a myth. He is a
brilliant reality. Why, he is a mail friend
of my own; and whatever may be said about
me, I can at least go into a friendship
with' as clean a reference as the next one.
Here it is:—
Certificate.
Boulogne 29/4/’l7
A. S. Sharp, N.C.0.: I certify that the u/ni is
tree from vermin.
Followed rank and etceteras. I protested
about the “u/m,” but I still have only
N.C.O. Sharp’s word for it that it was not,
a. matter of bad spelling, but an abbrevia-
tion of “undermentioned.”
As the Religious Editor “Kodak” (Ernest
O Ferrall) was long loved and respected.
"Kodak, a Great Religious Editor.
I alike the present and one other occupant
of the post, he dressed to the part, as Low
reveals in the first of his exquisite drawings
on this page. “Kodak’s” appearance was so
in accord with the exalted chair that he was
once hailed with vociferous profanity when
he attempted to board a warship in the
harbor, owing- to the sailor superstition—
said by some to be groundless—that a
parson always brings bad luck.
Poor "Kodak”—the pen of its own accord
lingers over him! He, the very man pic-
tured here, ‘wrote- that glorious gem, “The
Lobster and tire Lioness.” Also, he began
one story: “He was an old man who looked
as if he had plunged his face into a mug
of foaming whiskers and withdrawn it in
time to save his eyesight.” That story did
not live up to its beginning. Nothing
could. But his pen was eloquent of all
sorts of doings of drunks who took all
manner of monstrosities home with them
—and lie himself had been known to sneak
out through The Bulletin's back door and
go home at midday simply to dodge a caller
whom he suspected of an intention to ask
him out for a drink.
There is little enough resemblance be-
tween “Kodak” and one other Religious
Editor-—W. H. Traill. Once a bricklayer
annoyed Traill by heaving bricks down
imihediately over the office lie was working
in. Traill, who used to get about the build-
ing dressed in trousers and shirt, rushed
upstairs, sighted the bricky and bellowed,
“Stop that infernal row!,” “Who the
are you talking to?” the bricky demanded.
I raill hissed out a remark with many
notable Christian epithets in it; then,
according to Archibald, he seized the bricky,
lifted him and hurled him clean through the
open window..
There was a Religious Editor!
I should like to be able to record that
Norman Lindsay had
held the post, but I
cannot. I have found
that veracity ha s
its dividends. Still,
Norman would have
got at least one vote
in a plebiscite. The
Vote, very drunk,
boarded a train to
the mountains. As
far as Emu Plains
(where David
Wright is now, and
where just lately I
saw a single ray
from the sunset
slanting down on to
a still grave; I don’t
know whose per-
haps David’s); up to
there the drunk held
forth on sundry
things, from growing
boronia to printing
the classics on shav-
ing paper and get-
ting them known.
Then, as the train
began 'to climb the
slopes, he shouted to
a thin-faced traveller
beside him. “I be-
lieve that Bulletin
artist Norman Liiid-
say lives up here. He’s a good ’uni!
Only they tell me he gets that drunk he
can’t find his way home.” “So I believe,”
said Norman, who stepped out at his
station a little further up and left that
sure Vote behind him for ever, Unfortu-
nately (having the Religious Editorship in
mind), Norman Lindsay.was then, and ]
believe still is, a teetotaller.
But most of this is writing Genesis back-
wards. However, one other may be per-
mitted a quick glance over the shoulder
Archibald, looking back, remarked: “The
Bulletin is not what it was—thank God!”
Looking over these old files, to the day
when The Bulletin was a slender news-
paper, without a red jacket, I am surprised
at the ease with which I can agree with
Archibald.
Drastically summarised, the journalistic
and literary history of The Bulletin is
this. It began in wretched circumstances
just over 50 years ago. Its first issue gave
yards to a murder trial. Later it was saic
to be blasphemous, spoke disparagingly of
a Prince of Wales, even libelled a publican
Then it made in turn the Australian poem
and the Australian short story, and has
lately been busy making the Australian
novel. London Times went so far as to
say that it made Australia. The records
do not reveal why The Bulletin did not
sue for libel.
Archibald once went to gaol for his
paper—over a libel for which the damages
were a farthing but the costs stiff—and
ever after he held his respect, if not
his regard, for the law. All good and
religious editors should. Apparently James
Edmond did. In a competition in which
good money was offered for two essays
one for and one against, on a given topic,
aspirants to compete pseudonymouslv
Edmond fired a shot at both targets and
scored a bull on each. He must have been
a sore man when he received only one
award, but he said nothing— at least not
in a barrister’s hearing.
Of the first concocter of a Bulletin
libel—Harold Grey, whose name was Theo-
dore Argles—a kindly biographer has written
that he was “the scapegrace son of a London
solicitor, and was born with a mental and
moral distortion of mind.” A mental dis-
tortion of mind ought to be. excuse for
almost anything, but the bill came to £lOOO
However, the horsewhip (justly so?) was
more popular. One chap who called to flog
Archibald was repulsed with a pair o:'
scissors, enormous things like shears -which
Archibald swore he never used, but merely
kept because he “liked the feel of them.’
Traill had a way with him where horse-
whippers were concerned. He was a great
shaggy Highlander, with a big square heac

Two men who burst in with whips began to

whether there is anything better of its

paper. He intended giving away prizes

unpublished book in the Mitchell Library
—“Autobiographies of Australian and New
Zealand Authors and Artists: Collected by
A. G. Stephens, The Bookfellow, 1901-1924:

characters would have made efficient Relig-
ious Editors, but all would have to be
embraced in a jubilee shout.

I stop to let Professor Brereton contribute
to this chapter: I' made an appoint-
ment with Lawson to go with him and
hear a lecture by Mark Twain. When ]
looked lor him that evening at McGrath’s
Hotel, where he lodged, I found him
stretched on -a couch in the parlor and in
a deep slumber. I woke him with difficulty,
and by the time we reached the Protestant
Hall there were very few vacant seats. 1
modestly sat in a remote place near the
door, but Henry,-mindful of his deafness,
argued manfully’ with an usher and was
accommodated with a chair in the front row,
within a couple of feet of the side of the
platform. When there was applause at
Mark 1 wain’s sallies, our poet joined in
vigorously by kicking the; nearest boards,
so that the lecturer’s floating mane of silver
hair trembled at the vibration. After the
entertainment I met Henry in the street
and was surprised at the spiendid condition
ol his headgear. ‘Where on earth did vou
get that new hat, Henry?’ I asked. He
took it off, gazed at it with lively pleasure,
replaced it, and replied: ‘Dunno. It was

Lawson was a frequent visitor to Angus

Here’s the Experience in
Motorist’s own words.
"Dear Sirs,
In fairness to you
and as information
to fellow motorists I
feel I mu SI tell you of
my experience with
the latest ‘ Bull-Dog
Grip’ Outfit.
The efficiency of the new Bull-Dog Grip Tube
repairing method has been shown in a remarkable
way by the experience related here by a satisfied
user. A leaky radiator hose, a cover fracture, a
blowout, and a puncture all repaired thoroughly
and permanently the same day.
Top left illustration —

nection —successfully re-

On a run from my Victorian residence, near Yarra-
nt onga, to Sydney (approximately 470 miles which I
was anxious to cover in a day ) I got through owing to
B Dog Grip.
When about 60 miles on the way my radiator hose
connection bur§t. By lowering the water below the
leak, I patched the hose as one would an ordinary
tube, and was on the track in a few minutes.
Later on we had a naSty inside fraClure on one front
cover. Not having any blow-out piasters I repaired the
tube and also placed a patch on the inside of the frac-
ture with the red patching material. This emergency
repair has run 600 miles since and is Hill O.K.
I made a Stranded motor cyclist happy by giving him
enough patching material to effect a repair on his rear
tube.
Wishing you success, as your products are a very real
aid to motorists,

TYRE-BUYING is simple if you keep these few things in
mind :
pj rst __ a car tyre has just two main parts: tread and carcass.
Second—there are concrete reasons why Goodyear Tyres
are superior in both these two parts.
Third—these reasons can be demonstrated and proved.
1 Press your hand down on the Goodyear All-Weather
Tread. Feel the grip of the deep-cut sharp-edged blocks,
placed in the centre of the tread, where they belong.
That shows why the Goodyear Tread imprints its safe and
slipless pattern on the road, and why it has superior traction.
2 Ask your Goodyear Dealer to show you on his cord-testing
machine the greater stretch—up to 60% —in Goodyear
Supertwist Cord over ordinary cord.
This extra stretch gives the Goodyear Supertwist carcass
its unmatched vitality, enabling it to withstand road-shocks
and continuous flexing without premature failure.
These advantages in Goodyear Tyres pay big dividends in
high mileage and low cost. Proof of their validity and that
they are popularly understood is found in the fact that
MORE PEOPLE, THE WORLD OVER, RIDE ON
GOODYEAR TYRES THAN ON ANY OTHER KIND.

The Man Within.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
IN the house we call our own,
Built of blood and flesh and bone,
There lurks a Sylvan Man;
’Tis the same that danced of old
Down the ways of green and gold
In the goat-footed train of the, sweet god
Pan.
Though his voice may be drowned
In the day’s dusty round
Of worry and of strife.
Bound in chains, held in thrall,
He is with us, one and all,
And he shouts and he fights for the old
free life.
When the moments drab and sour
Limp along from hour to hour,
’Tis he that makes them so ;
For he knows no other good
Than the waters and the wood.
And the reeds above the waters and the
waters singing low.
Should your heart within rebel
At the four walls where you dwell,
With their trim and ordered rooms,
Know this much, and have a care,
It is he a-crave for air
And the rain-sweetened smells of leafy
forest glooms.
Should the plumes of pleasure moult,
And the soul in hot revolt
Cry “A murrain on your toil !”
’Tis he who would be out
Where the winds of Heaven shout,
And the creeping crickets sing in the
moist, brown soil.
When the golden stars arise,
He makes windows of your eves,
And looks out upon the night.
And ’tis he that cries “Awake!”
When the gleams of morning break,
And the great sea heaves in the dawn’s
rosy light.
Since you hold him
captive still,
He compels you to his
will,
And his will is to-
wards the Wild —
Towards the Open and
the Free,
And the blossom and
the tree,
And the heart and
the eyes of .a
little laughing
child.
He will listen at each
ear
For the sound he holds
so dear
And the music that
he loves—
For the wind among
the leaves.
And the rustling of
the sheaves,
And the singing of
the thrushes and
the cooing of the
doves.
Since you hold him
captive still,
He compels you to his
will,
And his will is to-
wards the Wild —
Towards the singing
waterfall
And the feathered
minstrels call,
And the heart and
the ears of a
little laughing
child.
When as now the
breezes blow —
Low and high, high
and low —
’Tis the Sylvan
Men that shout.
’Tis the free-limbed Sylvan Men
Of the forest glade and glen,
As they dance upon the mosses in a
merry-footed rout.
Hark! At rest I may not be,
For their summons comes to me,
To the Sylvan Man within;
And I toil and sweat no more,
Foil it thrills me to the core
With a sweetness that outswcetens ringing
harp or violin.
Over lake and over land,
Over river, rock and sand,
Comes that summons from the west;
And the sun is shining warm,
And the bees a-humming swarm,
And a-roaming I must go at my Sylvan
Man’s behest.

[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
as he ran his knife up the sheep’s belly and
peeled off the warm skin.
“What th’ hell’s wrong with you?” he
asked himself. “Losing your nerve, is it?
Not the first time you’ve had a sheep’s blood
on your hands!”
And he thought of the supper he would
prepare when he humped the choicest cuts
of mutton back to the camp, and the wel-
come he would get from the men in the hut.
“Snowy, you old bastard,” they would say,
“what’ve you got now? Been out souvenirin’
again, Snow? Well, if you’re not the king
of the rats!”
It was an illusion, of course, that the
misty outlines of the downs had seemed for
the moment as familiar as the banks of the
Loddon. He had had such moments before,
though none so vivid and overpowering.
Pausing for a while in his work, he looked
over his shoulder to make sure no one was
watching him, and his sun-wrinkled eyes took
in the long folds of cropped turf that were
almost bare of shrub or bush. Though it
was early in the afternoon there was no
human being in sight. The camp lay behind
a screen of trees three miles away, and dotted
about the foreground were tiny woods, farms,
villages, but the light fog exhaled by the
earth blurred all edges so that nothing stood
out sharply. Nothing but the sheep-pads
in the chalk that made faint lines of white
against the green!
Peter had been taking a short out across
the downs to a neighboring village when
he had come across the sheep, crippled and
caught by its wool in a thick clump of
blackberries, and at once it had appealed
to him as food. Fresh meat for once!
Enough for the whole crowd, too! He was
haunted by a hunger that had never been
fully satisfied since he landed in England.
It was a joke with the other men in the
hut —this insatiable appetite of his. Often
he stole out at night to try to snare a
rabbit, but he wasn’t often successful.
Rabbits were as scarce as anything else fit
to eat. Twice in a fortnight he had been
lucky, and then there had been a royal
supper in the hut, the other men gathering
round and sniffing up the thick smell as he
AS Peter Coulter drew his knife across
the sheep’s throat he had a strange
impression that it had all happened
before. A disturbing impression! Some
curtain in the dark part of his mind seemed
to lift a moment and reveal another self,
standing among the mists of the Wiltshire
Downs watching the glassy look in the
sheep’s eyes and the warm blood spurting
over his hand. He was flooded by emotions
foreign to him, oppressed by a sense of
timelessness. The damp of the downs crept
into his bones, and their chill air blew
across his spirit: he felt as rooted to the
spot as the gnarled oak on the skyline or
the outcrops of limestone that showed up
whitely against the sodden earth. No longer
was he Snowy Coulter, who had been raked
out of the line for a short course of train-
ing in the machine-gun school; he was some-
body else. And he had forgotten where he
had come from and what was his mission.
It was only for a few moments that the
impression lasted in its full vividness, but it
affected him powerfully. His hand shook
NO OMELETTES WITHOUT EGGS.
“What, my child — you’ve broken two windows!”
“Yes, mummy! But what’s a window or two when Australia’s so short of good cricketers!”
stewed it in the fire-bucket over the stove.
But one rabbit didn’t go far among a crowd,
and before long he was hungry again, his
imagination calling up large cheeses, heavy
quarters of beef, loaves of home-made bread
—all the rich food he had been used to
seeing in unlimited quantity ever since he
was a youngster.
It seemed an outrageous thing that grown
men should go hungry, much more out-
rageous than killing a sheep that had fallen
into his hands. He hadn’t the slightest
compunction about that. It was the asser-
tion of a natural right, and as he cut up
the carcase he had a fuller sense of his own
human dignity than he ever had when mop-
ping up the last drop of watery stew from
his plate in the mess-hut.
“None of the boys’ll go short of a feed to-
night,” he told himself with a chuckle.
“They won’t feel inclined to sling off at my
appetite, neither. I’ll plant it here and
smuggle the best part of it home in my over-
coat when I’m going back.”
How was it that the sense of having done
all this before flashed through his mind
again! Was it that the smell of the fresh
skin and greasy wool penetrated some remote
cell in his brain and evoked memories? Not
memories of the sheepyards on his father’s
farm on the Loddon, though! Something
mistier, vaguer, connected with the very
landscape on which he was looking!
An alien landscape, really! He remem-
bered quite well how it had affected him
when he had seen it first two years before.
In a wet mist he had marched from the boat-
train with his company, three miles of dull
slogging, and it had seemed as if the grey
blanket of a sky came down close to the
earth and fused with it. Bare trees around
and sodden leaves underfoot! When at last
the grim iron roofs of the training-camp
loomed up in front he had been seized by
an acute attack of homesickness, and had
longed for a sight of the Loddon river-gums
standing up in the morning sunlight.
They came back to his mind now as he
walked on toward the village, and his
thoughts flitted confusedly between the two
worlds that were so profoundly different,
He had set out to visit some relations of
his father who lived in the village, and
it seemed strange to him that he should be
the link between these downs and the Lod-
don. Until a couple of years before he had
never heard of Elias and Aunt Jupp, and yet
there they were, a whole nest of relations,
some of them bearing his name, and all of
them recalling family traits and peculiarities.
Wasn’t Martha’s noSe the very spit of his
Aunt Rachel’s, in spite of their being so
different in everything else?
“It’s a mixed-up world,” he thought,
standing with his hand on the gate of a
small cottage. “This is the last place I’d
have thought of searching for the tap-root
of the family tree. Somewhere near the
last,* anyway!”
Yet again the sense of having entered that
gate countless years ago ! It must be some
smell that came from the wet loam and
turned his mind upside down.
He was met at the door by a shy. middle-
aged woman who welcomed him with move-
ments and gestures rather than with her
tongue.
“Why, it’s you walked over again, Peter!
iCoom along in. Aunt Jupp’s a-settin’ up
to-day. Her birthday, it is. Ninety-foor,
she be, this very day.”
She seemed a little afraid of his big figure
in its strange uniform, and her eyes flut-
tered away whenever he looked at her, but
there was no mistaking the warmth of her
greeting. Taking his heavy overcoat she
ushered him into the cosy living-room that
reeked of coal smoke and cooked food, and
in the dim light Peter became aware of a
withered crone sitting by the fire. This
was the surviving ancient of the family, deaf,
a little daft, but holding as tenaciously on
to life as the horny slrell of a cicada to the
bark of a tree.
' “Here’s Peter a-coom over to see you,”
shouted Martha in her ear. “You remember
Peter, Aunt Jupp. He’s been here afore.”
The crone looked up at Peter with in-
tensely bright eyes, and her tongue clucked
inarticulately, but as soon as he had greeted
her she seemed to forget his presence and
relapsed into a steady scrutiny of the coals
again.
Feter sank down into a chair on the other
side of the fire and unbuttoned his tunic,
a feeling of warmth flowing through him.
Ah, that warmth! It stole to his head like
the’ fumes of wine and sent cheerful pic-
tures flitting before his inner eye. He
wanted to loosen his tongue, to make jokes
witli the shy. middle-aged woman who was
laying the table.
“What d’vou think happened as I was
coming across the downs?” he was tempted
to say. “Blest if I didn’t drop across a
sheep, crippled and caught in the black-
berries! Talk about luck! Sweetest thing
I’ve struck since I lobbed here. I could
have brought vou a nice hunk of mutton
if I’d thought' of it.” But something re-
strained him, checked any outflow of high
spirits. In those surroundings his voice
sounded strange to him. a little too robust
and harsh. Life seemed to have been muffled
in that little cottage for generations, and
there was a sense of repression even in the
ticking of the large wooden clock on the
mantelpiece It was like a deep, untroubled
pool to Peter after the racket of the camp
—the bellowing of orders, the rattle of tin
plates in the mess-hut, the crackle of Lewis
o'uns on the range.
lie looked round the room with sharp,
restless eyes as if trying to discover the
secret of its cosy solidity. The plastered
walls had spots of damp on them, and seemed
to have been designed to deaden sound, nor
could any voice from the outside world com a
in through the casement windows, sealed by
the custom of generations. The woolly hang-
ings and rugs, the antimacassars, the china
doo-s and ornaments all belonged to another

years could have made very little difference

; rone
° Fifty years! Peter shuddered as if a
breath from the grave had blown over him.
Life to him meant movement, change, the
ploughing of new fields.
“Draw your chair up to the table,” said
Martha “You must be famished after that
walk There’s little to eat in the camp,
I’ll warrant.”
“Not too much,” said Peter, thinkiug of
the dead sheep. “Most nights we go to bed
hungry. We’re a hungry crowd, us Dig-
gers.”
“It’s a terrible life, sojering,” Martha
intoned. “Thafik God we got plenty good
food here —for the present, anyway. Elias
digs among the vegetables, night and morn-
ing, afore lie goes to his work. Here he's
a-coomin’ now !”
Elias was a heavy, stiff-jointed man of
about fifty, who walked as if the damp had
got into his bones. His corduroy trousers
were stained from the knees downward with
a coloring of mould, and his thick boots
were coated with it. It seemed natural to
him, not a thing of which he could rid him-
self. He looked as if he had stood among
wet earth so long that he had become rooted
in it like a post or a tree.
“Hullo, Peter!” he said, drawing his
chair out from the table. “The war still
a-goin’ on?”
Ho took up his knife and fork with clumsy
fingers and bent over his plate. Though his
back was bowed his blue eyes were clear as
a baby’s, and his pink face with its droop-
ing, straw-colored moustache suggested ripen-
ing fruit. The slowness of his speech was
almost painful to Peter; apparently his mind
didn’t work any more quickly than his joints.
“Aunt Jupp do be celebrating her birth-
day,” he said, inclining liis head towards
the old crone by the fire. “First day oop
since the end of zoomer. Ninety-foor, she
be, this very day.”
Most of the burden of conversation fell
upon Peter. He talked with a jerky energy
about his home on the Eoddon, calling up
pictures of the river flats and the paddocks
at harvest time; but his words fell flat and
awakened no response. It was like dropping
stones into a deep well and waiting for the
splash that never came. There seemed to
be soundless depths in the slow being of
Elias that couldn’t be fathomed: what was
he thinking about as he bent oyer his plate,
munching solemnly and occasionally shift-
ing his heavy boots along, the floor? No-
thing perhaps. His eyes, though soft, were
as expressionless as colored glass.
Once, though, a
flicker of interest
passed through them.
“Australia?” he re-
peated as though the
word had struck some
nerve of memory.
“Ah, yes, I were
a-goin’ there once.
That was when I were
a lad and had a
notion to see the
world. I were fair
set on ships them
days, and Uncle Ver-
ney, who were a sailor,
could ha’ got me a
passage. They reck-
oned, though it wore
too fur away. Aunt
Jupp there wouiun t
hear of it. There be
too many of our
family went abroad
and never coom back.”
Yet he seemed tv
draw a slow pleasure
from the thought that
he might have been
one of them. He
turned it round and
round in his mind like
a cow chewing its cud.
After fully five min-
utes of reflection he
said with a sly
chuckle:
“I might ha’ owned
a sheep-ranch by now
if ’t ’adn’t been I
stayed a-home here. I
might lia’ been roomin’
back here a rich man,
spendin’ money* at
hotels and hob-nob-
bin’ with th’ gentry.”
Peter tackled the
toasted crumpets and
played with this sug-
gestion, but his mind
was on the sheep,
and the eyes of Elias slowly became
opaque again. His imagination had never
been used to exerting itself for long.
The red coals flickered into little flames
that danced on the white crockery, on
the snowy tablecloth and on the wrinkled
face of Aunt Jupp, who sat motion-
less by the fire. Occasionally an echo of
their conversation floated over to her, and
once she beckoned to Martha,
What is it they re a-sayin Martha?
“Nothing, Aunt Jupp. Just a-talkin
about the war.
A flicker of life passed over the old
womans face at the word. It seemcc to
touch some chord of emotion in her: her
clasped fingers twitched, and she mumbled
incoherently about some Thomas who was
killed before he was twenty,
And not even Ins mother knowed where
they buried him,” she repeated,
Her nose and chin came together, and
she got Martha to bring her some faded
letters from a drawer in the corner,
It slowly became evident to Peter that
the war she was brooding over happened
many years before, in the Crimea. In that
atmosphere even his own sense of time be-
came confused, and he lost his very clear
and definite perspectives.. It was like look-
ing out over the downs at the little woods
and villages half-hidden in the mists, hardly
knowing whether they were one mile away
or five. As he watched Elias and Martha,
and the old crone by the fire, the remem-
brance that they were of his own blood gave
him a queer ghostly feeling. In spite of
the warmth and cosiness that satisfied his
body, his mind was penetrated by a chill
wind that stole in through the chinks. He
had only the vaguest notion of how these
people were related to him. Martha was
his father’s cousin, perhaps, and Elias was
her brother, but where did Aunt Jupp come
in? He had never bothered about relations
before, or taken any interest in the family
tree, but here these things had a new mean-
ing. A family really did seem like a tree
rooted in the earth and bearing leaves of
the same shape. “I’d rather be a cutting
and send down roots of my own,” he thought
rebelliously.


But in spite of his self-assertion he was
haunted by a sense of being cramped, held
down. Who was this Snowy Coulter, with
two stripes on his sleeve and a girl waiting
for him back on the Loddon? He had a
horrible feeling that his personality was a
small thing, fugitive and flickering, beside
the family mould that made the old crone
by the fire remind him so oddly of his
father.
She rose at last to go to bed, and he seized
the opportunity to take his leave, As she
said good-bye to him she placed a withered
hand on his shoulder and stared into his
face with her strange, piercing eyes: for
fully a minute that uncanny stare lasted,
“You be like your gran’father,” she
nodded. “Same sart o’ heavy brow, same
sart o’ look to ’ee. Three of us there were.
THE BREED.
STRANGER: "Bob-tailed cat, I see. Manx?”
NATIVE: “No. Motor.”
an’ him the oldest. A fine, upstanding lad he
were, too.”
The rumbling voice, coming out of some
dim past, disconcerted Peter almost as much
as her clairvoyant gaze arid her clutching
grip on his shoulder. He laughed jerkily:
“It must have been a long time ago, Aunt
Jupp. Died before I was born, gran’-dad
did —years before. I never even heard dad
speak of him—fact, never knew I had any
relations-on this side till just before I came
away. We’re not too good at keeping track
of relations in our family.”
He had raised his voice to overcome her
deafness, and it had the same hearty ring
as when he was speaking to his mates in the
hut. Bjit the old woman hardly seemed to
have heard him. She had lifted the casement
curtains with her bony hand, and was staring
out over the downs that were lit by the
moon.
“A fine, upstanding lad, with no spot or
blemish on him,” she repeated. “But they
took him away—aye, they took him away
Pity they didn’t let ham be a sojer like he
wanted to be and get killed in the wars.”
“Come on, Aunt Jupp,” said Martha
quietly, “it’s bedtime.”
“The elms fbi| thickening for bud,” said
the old womaii. “The little birds ’ll be
building nests in the witlieys by the river-
bank yarnder.”
“Well, good-bye,” said Peter, holding out
his hand. I’ll come again.”
“Yes, come again,” the old woman re-
peated. “You’re like your grarf father. ...
Many’s the time I walked that river-bank
with him, watching the plover running in
the water-meadows, him a grown lad, and
me a slip of a girl—an’ many’s the time I
heard the squeak of a rabbit unner his
hand. It was the love of that brought the
curse on him. They took him away for
killing a bit of a sheep on the downs yarnder
and transported him over the sea.... ‘l’ll
coom back,’ he says; but he never did-
They took him away.... took him away!”
She spoke as if she had some object before
her eyes that was clearer than those around
her, and her voice grew thin and wavery
witli emotion. Or perhaps it was only the
memory of emotion.
“Come on, Aunt Jupp,” pleaded Martha.
“You be getting cold.”
The old woman nodded her head as she
shuffled out of the room on Martha’s arm.
“Ninety-foor,” she mumbled. “That’s
eighty years agone n0w.... They took him
away—aye, they took him away.”
Peter found himself out on the open road
in the moonlight, and though it was not'cold
a shiver went through him as if he had
been stripped to the bone. The night-air
seemed to release scents from the earth,
the breath of upturned fields, of soaked
water-meadows, the smell of mould. Lights
shone dimly from the houses of the village,
as if through water, but nothing stirred and
there was no sound. It was as if all the
world had sunk into a trance, and Peter had
a sudden longing for the faces of the men
he knew and for their rough, hearty voices.
He hesitated as he looked over the downs
that lay so still in the moonlight, patches
of gorse streaking them here and there with
shadows. It was seven miles across there
to the camp, and he could almost see the
glitter of lights: it was nearly ten round
by the road. But how could he track across
there with no company but his own thoughts?
He had a sudden vision of the sheep lying
wrapped in its skin under the blackberry
bushes, the severed head, the beads of dew
on the wool. And what was that ghostly
figure that hung about near it?
No, the boys would have to go without
their mutton. If he himself lay awake that
night it wouldn’t be from hunger.
“Let the dead bury their dead”.... he
thought vaguely.
And turning to the right he set off briskly
down the white road.

her ' lon S brown fingers, drawing it
tight as a bowstring, then releasing it with
twangs that cracked the silence. When at
last the frayed fibre snapped, she tossed the
broken ends petulantly Thun her, and, slap-
ping her shapely bare thigh with her hand,
demanded sharply, “Then thou wilt not?”
Her husband slowly raised his head from
the carved wooden neck-rest, sat up and
yawned, rubbing sleep from his drowsy eyes
with big, work-roughened fists.
“How can I?” he asked. “Did not the
taubada say he would gaol the next wife-
beater? And there is that old snake in
Government clothes, Bagi, wiki with me for
wedding thee, and only biding his time to
stir up trouble. Offer him the spear-haft
and lie will use the point. At thy first yelp
he would handcuff me and take me off to

thee, my little one, that needs more wit and
brawn than wife-beating.”
He looked up pleadingly, but his wife
sprang to her feet in exasperation, standing
before him, slim and graceful as the new
moon. The dawn light threw shadows on
rounded bosom and limb, and she looked
distractingly pretty in spite of pouting lips
and stormy eyes! The flush of anger beneath
the copper hue of her cheeks made him think
of red jasmine, so darkly beautiful, whilst
curving outlines brought desire
welling within him. He stretched
out possessive arms, the thick,
corded muscles showing his great
strength, but she stamped her foot
with vexation.
“Braggart!” she shrilled scorn-
fully. “The oilfields are many steps
away. Dost think the village takes
thy word for doughty deeds? How
long am I to be the jest of Wamai,
married to a ninny, a fool? Fool!
Yea, that’s what folk say of thee
and tliy new ideas. Only last
evening when I carried food to the
widows' hut they jeered at me.
Old Puji said, ‘What! Wedded for
a moon and never a beating! Thy
husband is like his father before
him, a ninny afraid of his wife!’ ”
She spat the words at him, but
..1 n.-.
he was slow to anger.
“Bah!” he said good-humoredly. “Take
no heed of those old mischief-makers who sit
in darkness all day and do naught but hatch
trouble. Who expects clean water from that
foul pool?”
He fumbled in the camphor-wood box at
his side, tore a scrap from a newspaper,
and, taking a piece of thick twist from the
lobe of his ear, began to shred it for a
cigarette.
She watched him sulkily, then began
again.
“ ’Tis not the widows alone. All the
village is talking of thee and thy new
fashions. They mock at thy clothes, at our
garden, and laugh at thee behind thy back
because thou art afraid of beating me I
have borne it because I thought thou wen
a c l £ an - Now thou sa y est thou art afraid
of Bagi, an old fellow even if he is the con-
stable and weareth the Government clothes
Afraid of the white man! Afraid of gaol!
But they shall say truly thou art afraid of
thy wife. Wit and brawn ! Stout fellow
indeed!”
. Seizing a paddle she made as if to strike
him with its light blade; but with an agile
spring he was on his feet facing her, clench-
ing his great fists and snarling back her
panted insults.
With a flicker of alarm she recoiled a
pace at the white-heat she had provoked
shrinking from the savage glare of his fierce
eyes so suddenly aflame with the blood-lust
of his savage forebears; yet with a little
sensation of triumph and pleasure thrilling
in her breast, bracing herself for the coming
blows ; prepared to run shrieking along the
street, letting the sneering gossips see that
she had indeed wed a man, a masterful
man.
The blow never fell. Duna’s dark face
suddenly cleared, his snarl turning to a
guffaw.
‘‘That was indeed well done, thou cun-
ning one! Almost didst thou goad me to lay
the paddle across thy soft shoulders. But
try it not twice. For a moment murder
stood at my elbow and nudged me in the
ribs. Bisten, Embo. I have lived long
amongst white men. I speak their tongue;
I know their fashions and they are good.
White men do not beat their wives, and
neither will I. Am I not like a white man,
with gear and pound-notes in plenty? Why
should I obey worn-out laws? As well ask
mo to become Tcawpi [cannibal] like my
father’s father.”
“Thou thinkest money arid gear are every-
thing,” she snapped. “Will they bring luck
if thou offend the spirits by
disobedience? Will they buy
courage ? Since the Govern-
ment forbids killing, how else
can a man show his courage
but by beating his wife?”
He laughed softly.
“ ’Tis not only gaol I fear.
I have a heavy hand, my little
squirrel, as many a one of my
work-gang found to his sorrow.
I am loath to bruise thy sweet-
ness, for thou art soft and juicy
as the ripe manoon. Come, for-
get the babblings of those old
fools in thy Duna’s arms; then
we will away to our garden, for
the scrub-lien hath long called
the hour. My new trap will surely have
set its teeth in the long-snouted thief
that steals our taro sets, and to-night thou
canst stop the gabbling mouths in the
widows’ hut with a lump of pig. And may
it choke the old saruapisis” he cursed under
his breath. ■ |
Seeing defeat, Embo flung the paddle
and the sharp edge of the blade caught him
on the shin. Had she waited she might
have received the longed-for beating; but
with a last taunt, choking with sobs, she
fled before Duna, breathing strange oaths,
had done hopping on one foot in his anguish
at the keen blow.
When the pain had subsided, he put on
the white singlet and blue dungaree trousers
which had excited so much adverse com-
ment amongst the villagers, whose garb was
the skimpy tree-bark loincloth, and, taking
his pig-spear, went out and loitered about,
smoking as he leaned awhile over the low
walls of his pigsty, hoping that his young
wife would return, that together they might
go to their garden.
He poked the fat ribs of Pomkini, a short-
snouted, white man’s pig, bought from a
coast trader at a cost of three months’ pay,
filled her clam-shell trough with cocoanut
kernels and gave her water.
Still Embo did not appear; but he waited
on, sauntering to the hedge to pluck a glow-
ing scarlet hibiscus blossom which he stuck
jauntily in his well-combed, jetty friz, and,
rolling another cigarette, kept covert watch
for her.
BLESSINGS BRIGHTEN.
MISTRESS: “And so your poor husband is dead?”
MRS. POTSTICK: “Yes, mum. . He wasn’t one for looks when he was alive, but [brighten-
ing up a little ], he did make an ’andsome corpse.”
The village grew emptier as family after
family passed and disappeared down jungle
tracks; but no Embo appeared, and Duna
looked angrily towards the widows’ hut,
huddled in the dusky shade cast by a grove
of breadfruit-trees, close on the verge of
the thick web of jungle which hemmed in
the village.
Its low doorway was closely sealed by
finely-plaited matting, and the shaggy walls
and low-hung roof of kura-kura, thick and
overlapping, made it look like a monstrous
beehive. No laughing children played o-wo
in and out of its moss-grown piles; no
cheerful womenfolk chattered on its veran-
dah. It stood gloomily apart from the noisy
life of the village—a tomb, not for the dead,
but for the living, in which custom decreed
that the widows of Wamai should be in-
terned, to drag out a useless existence until
released by offer of marriage or wooed and
won by that last grim suitor, Death.
The hut was a hotbed of scandal, its
inmates, secluded though they were, having
a finger in every stewpot. Rigid sticklers
for etiquette, and jealously upholding ancient
custom, they were consulted secretly by the
womenfolk at every birth, wedding and
death. It was whispered in the ravi that
love philtres and death potions were brewed
in that sinister dwelling, and that the widows
could see all that went on in the village, day
or night, walls or no walls; though some
bold men said that the widows had spy-
holes poked in the thatch and ears as wide
as the mouth of a gourd to catch the village
news.
Dun a muttered curses on them for trouble-
makers, and wondered uneasily if his wife
was inside taking counsel with the old har-
ridans.
Presently his neighbor Aviri, who had
been away for a week at a feast, joined
him; and, ashamed of waiting longer, Duna
whistled to his dog and the two men set
off to the garden.
“O ko !” said Aviri, as they came in sight
of the trim rows of newly-set taro tops.
“What fashion is this? Never have I seen
the like. I did not believe it when they
spoke of it in the ravi last night. Thou
hast planted them like ribbon policimani
marching at the barracki. One, two; one,
two. Lef’, ri’; lef’, ri’. That’s no way to
plant taro.”
He shook his head sadly, and Duna
squirmed at his chiding tones.
“ ’Tis white man’s fashion,” he explained.
“They plant everything in rows—cocoanuts,
Jcaima, corn —and it grows well.”
“Ah,” said Aviri, wagging his head wisely,
“but this is Wamai taro.” With his hard
heel he stamped holes here and there in the
moist black soil. “That’s the proper way
to plant taro,” he said. “As thy father did,
and his father before him. Else thou wilt
offend the spirit of the taro, who will send
a blight to curse thy crops. I see thou hast .
put in a tumeni, in spite of thy scorn of the
old ways,” he added slyly; pointing to a
young palm planted in a corner of the patch.
“That was Embo’s doing,” growled Duna.
“Women are full of such whimsies. She said
the taro would not grow unless it had its
sweetheart’s company, so I let her have her
way.”
“Didst thou hire the singer to chant the
Song of Growth?” inquired Aviri solicit-
ously.
“Not I! Why should I pay an old hum-
bug my hard-earned money?” was the im-
patient reply. “Come on. Let us look at
the trap.”
To his disgust there was no pig.
His neighbor inspected the new steel trap
with twinkling eyes.
“Didst expect to catch a pig with this
thing?” he asked, contemptuously poking it
with his spear. “Now if thou hadst used
a proper trap and a good charm as thy
fathers did before thee—why, we might have
eaten pig to-night. But this!”
He spat his scorn, squirting a good round
splash of blood-red betel juice on the empty
trap.
“I did call ‘Ma! Ma!’ to please Embo,”
confessed Duna sheepishly, “but naught else.
White men laugh at charms. They are no
good now that the Government rules th' l
land.”
His friend looked pityingly at him, then
gave a fat chuckle.
‘‘Dost think bush pigs know aught of
white men and their Government?” he
scoffed. ‘‘For New Guinea pig, New Guinea
medicine. Throw away this useless piece
of iron and let ns dig a good lioto; then,
with the proper charm, that thief of a pig
is as good as caught.”
When the pit had been dug and the sharp-
ened stakes bedded firmly in its bottom,
(Continued on next page.)


Aviri, taking the hibiscus from Duna’s hair,
plucked off its scarlet petals and strewed
them about, and with liberal libations of
spittle made it seem as though gouts of
blood had already splashed the pit. Taking
a long hair from the dried pig’s tail he
wore dangling from his earlobe, and wrap-
ping it in a leaf of aniseed, he cast it
amongst the red petals, muttering the invo-
cation, “Engcpu! Bipod to blood! Hair to
hair! Come hither, O pig!” and grunted
strenuously.
“There,” he said, satisfied at last with
his magic, “that’s good ‘medicine.’ Unless
someone hath ill-wished thee the pig is thine.
That’s work enough for to-day; let us walk
about.”
Spear in hand, they set off through the
jungle on the lookout for game; and as they
tramped along the dim path, Duna told of
his troubles with his wife.
“If I beat her Bagi will surely pounce on
me in the shake of a leaf and take me to
court. If I do not she will soon become
master in my house.”
“Thou wilt not be the first man to sing
low before his wife,” Aviri answered sym-
pathetically. “The greatest men in the ravi
grow small in their own huts. Yet, as no
man . wishes to be an echo, thou must be
firm, Duna. Give a woman an eel and she
asks a/turtle; give her a turtle and she
demand's a dugong. Hast heard the news
from Kupiri? At the feast Tata-Ko told
me that the women there make no more
sago to sell to the white trader unless they
are given half the pay! Stick for stick of
tobacco and shilling for shilling of money!
Aye, and not a bau-bau of smoke to be had
in spite of all the beatings until the men
give them what they demand. Kovave alone
knoweth where it will end; for let a woman
step aside ever so little from the path of
obedience, she knoweth no limit to her wan-
derings. A wife maketh a good servant;
but as master she squeezeth closer than a
python. After all, a moon in gaol is better
than a lifetime of bondage to a woman.
They tell me gaol is none too bad. Food in
plenty,, little work and pleasant company;
so give Embo the beating. A supple length
of stripped aolaba vine maketh a fine smart-
ing back and breaketh no bones, like a club;
for thou must remember there is thy new
garden for her to care for whilst thou art
ini. gaol.”
Still giving sage advice, Aviri led the way
through green glades hung with masses of
creepers under dim archways of gigantic
trees, into twilit vaults where the foliage
overhead shut out every ray of the scorch-
ing sun. Underfoot, gnarled and twisted, a
network of gangling roots spread like the
meshes of a komburu, ready to trip careless
feet.
Game was shy. Though drifts of butter-
flies flitted on gorgeous wings before them,
and hosts of golden-breasted honeysuckers
and jewelled parrakeets piped and whistled
in the leafy canopy, the two hunters list-
ened in vain for the whirring, rushing beat
of the hornbill’s great wings or the dull
boom of the cassowary. Looking up into
a manga-tree, where plump pigeons, glutton-
ing on the ripe nutmegs, cooed in security,
Duna sighed for the gun he had had to leave
with his master at the oilfield.
In a swamp by the river they staved off
the pangs of hunger with squirming lengths
of ornaro borers taken from a rotten man-
grove log, and there beneath the heavy shade
of a nipa palm they dozed throughout the
heat of the day, awakening to see the sun
fast disappearing behind the feathery man-
groves and dusk brimming over from the
east.
“We are far from home,” said Aviri,
yawning and stretching, “and my belly cries
out for food. Let us take the track to
Marua. A night alone will give thy wife
time to drown her wants in her worries.
A little neglect makes a woman love thee
more.”
Duna agreed, fearing Embo’s ridicule if
he went home empty-handed after his brave
talk of pig for supper, dreading, too, that
she would begin harping on her desire for
a beating; for in spite of Aviri’s advice, he
had no wish to spend a month in the lockup,
and so leave Bagi, the village constable,
free to cast covetous eyes on his young wife.
Urged by their bellies, they set off at a
trot along the track by the river towards
Marua.
Suddenly Aviri turned, and, clutching at
his companion, dragged him aside into the
bush, whispering, “Lie hid ! Here is a ribbon
policimani coming from Nai'ua.”
“Bah! Why hide?” asked Duna loftily.
“I savvy policimani. Many a time have
I talked and played with them when the
magistrate came ,to the oilfield. I once won
a pound from a sergeant.”
“ ’Twerc better to hide,” urged Aviri. “He
is alone; and when the taubada is not by
a policimani is but a New Guinea man with
a proud head and a ready hand.”
For answer Duna stepped boldly back
into the track, whilst the more timid Aviri
dived deeper into the thorny thicket, and was
out of sight when Armed-Constable Dengo,
smart in red-braided blue serge uniform,
came striding along, his rifle on his shoulder,
his swarthy face gloomy as a thundercloud.
Duna hailed him with a hearty “Good
day” in his best boss-boy manner, and pre-
pared to pass on, but Dengo stopped him
abruptly.
“Where are thy people, O bushman?”
he demanded harshly. “I seek carriers and
Marua village is empty.”
“Bushman thyself!” retorted Duna hotly.
“Hast no eyes to see this?” pointing proudly
to his trousers and tapping his fine leather
belt and . pouch. “Hast not wit enough to
tell a well-travelled man when thou seest
one? I am no toad living in a hole, know-
ing no other world than his own mud-
puddle.”
“Ah!” returned Dengo truculently. “A
bush-lawyer, art thou? Doubtless it is thee
who hath sent thy people into hiding that
they may not carry for the taubada. But
I’ll have one carrier at least for the trouble
of my journey.”
“I’m no Marua man,” expostulated Duna
hastily. “1 1 cannot carry for the taubada.
I have paid my tax. Besides, I am newly
married and my wife awaits me.”
“Thy wife awaits thee, and thou art on
thy way to Marua, yet are no Marua mau!
I’ll tell thee what thou art, and that is thou
art a liar,” sneered the policeman, drawing
a pair of handcuffs from his belt.
Filled with dismay, and knowing that once
the shackles were on his wrists his fate as
a carrier was sealed, Duna launched a blow
which struck Dengo squarely on his broad,
flat nose.
The blow was a mighty one. It had be-
hind it all the exasperation born of his wife’s
nagging for a beating, the failure of the new
pig-trap and the fruitless day’s hunting, be-
sides wounded pride at the opprobrious term
“bushman.”
Dengo crashed to earth before it, and for
a second Duna stood open-mouthed, gaping
at the blood spouting from the prostrate
man’s nose; then, realising the enormity of
his deed, he turned to flee. But as he
plunged into the bush the sharp, curving
thorns of a trailing aolaba vine caught in
his trousers, holding him, and before he was
able to tear himself free, Dengo was upon
him. The steel of the handcuffs closed on
his wrists, and strong fingers took a firm
grip in his bushy hair.
When Aviri, fearful and trembling, crept
back from hiding and peered through the
bushes at the rapidly-drying bloodstains and
marks of the scuffle, and saw Duna’s dog
running backward and forward along the
bank, howling and yelping at the swift-flow-
ing river, he groaned in consternation.
“Did I not warn him? Now that polici-
mani hath killed him and thrown his body
to the alligators. Ai-ee! Ai-ee! This
comes of trying new fashions and inviting
Kovave’s wrath.” And taking to his heels
he set off in the green twilight back to
Wamai, babbling aloud as he went, reciting
the account he would give of the murder.
THINGS BETTER LEFT UNSAID.
(The Paris kids celebrate Mardi Gras by wearing amazing masks.)
EXCESSIBELY SHORT-SIGHTED OLD GENT : “So this is little Michel....Tiens! How like
his father he is!”
Near Duna’s garden a horrifying thought
struck him. There was no witness to toll
of the deed, nor even to_ say that they had
met a policimani. What if folks said he had
invented the tale and had murdered Duna
himself? He shivered with dread. Bagi
would handcuff him and he would be hanged.
Thoughts thrust at his tormented brain
like the jabs of a spear, driving him to dis-
traction. His pace slackened, and a s he
passed the pitfall he paused, and. looking in,
saw a pig lying dead, impaled on the stakes.
Aviri felt cheered at the sight. “Surely
this is an omen. Without doubt the pig was
sent by the gods for Duna’s funeral feast,”
he thought. “If I go home with a tale of
murder, Bagi will arrest me, and I shall get
no share of this fine pig. The foolish man
is dead, so what matter how he died? Better
say we were crossing the Swamp of the
Leeches and an alligator snatched Duna from
the path.” And he hurried home with his
tale of disaster.
Though they had not his body to mourn
over, Duna’s funeral feast was a memorable
one. In addition to the bush pig caught
in the pit, Pomkini also figured amongst the
baked meats. Duna’s stock of pound-notes,
considerably depleted after the feast had
been paid for, passed into his father-in-law s
keeping. The new house was sealed with
matting so that the spirit of the dead man
could not return to his old quarters to haunt
the living, and his widow, Embo, caked with
the grey mud of mourning, was escorted to
the dismal hut in the shadows, and the vil-
lage took up its daily round once more.
There were now six widows of Wamai;
four of them emaciated old hags, dried ker-
nels of womanhood whose smoke-dried skins,
filthy with soot and grease, were but wrinkled
bags' loosely enveloping a collection of knob-
bly bones, and whose shrewd black eyes, set
in' cavernous sockets, peering through tangled
wisps of grizzled hair, were charged with
witchcraft.
The other widow, Embo’s aunt, Limomo,
was still in her prime. Full bosomed, with
strong arms and sturdy body, Limomo might
have been ransomed at the end of the one
moon of lamentation that custom demanded;
but the men, remembering the tongue with
which she had harried her late husband,
were in no hurry to take his place.
In the atmosphere of smoke, heat and
wrangling, time passed for Duna’s pretty
young widow as slowly as a palm grows
from a nut. Even so, when the month of
sorrow had waned and her mother appeared
one evening to announce “Thou wilt not
have long to stay buried, my daughter—Bagi
hath bespoken thee,” Embo answered pas-
sionately, “Nay, mother. Rather eternal
darkness than that old wife-beater. He hath
worn out three wives. Besides, I still mourn
Him who Sleepeth.”
“Tut, tut!” interjected Aunt Limomo.
“The plantain beareth but once. Pluck its
fruit whilst thou may. Bagi may have been
a little heavy-handed . with his wives, but
that only shows he is a proper man. Thou
art too hard to please, Embo. One is a
ninny because he will not beat thee, and
the other will beat thee too much. I wish
I had the chance of his beatings. Let a
man be master in his own house, say I.”
“Hush thy parrot’s chatter,” snapped Puji,
a shrewd old dame who had lived long years
in the hut. “Limomo, thy tongue is as long
as a trail of ants, but worse, for it gets no-
where. Embo. listen to me!”
She drew the widows into a close circle,
and at her whispered suggestion the other old
women broke into peals of cracked laughter,
coughing and chuckling and holding their
lean ribs as tears of mirth dropped from
their rheumy eyes. Limomo’s sour face
brightened, and 1 even Embo's sad eyes
twinkled. ;
When Embo’s mother returned next day
and was sent to tell Bagi that her daughter
was willing, but, being shy, wished to slip
quietly at nightfall from her seclusion to
his hut, he made no demur, and willingly
paid.the small bride-price, a widow commands.
After nightfall, when the village street was
deserted, a shrouded figure slid through the
doorway of the widows’ hut, and, stealing
along in the shadows, stepped silently in-
side the hut where the old constable had
shaved off his stubbly widower’s beard and
was waiting in the darkness for the bride
he had so long coveted.
The following morning Aviri, astir before
dawn to set his fish-traps, came paddling
frantically back along the mist-enshrouded
river.
“A ghost! A ghost!” he bawled as he tore
through the village. “The spirit of Duna
is on the river! With mine own eyes have
I seen it.”
Frightened faces peered from hut door-
ways. “A , ghost! A ghost!” sent them
scuttling inside for firesticks and torches,
drums and conches, to drive the wanderer
back to the Abode of Spirits.
No one caring to be the first to venture
out, the street was empty When Duna tied
up the canoe he had borrowed for his jour-
ney from Marua, where the police whale-
boat had landed him after a month in gaol
for his assault on Armed-Constable Dengo.
He wore a wisp of calico round his loins, for
the magistrate, with a tart reminder of the
Native Clothing Regulation, had confiscated
his fine trousers and singlet. Ashamed that
anyone should see his humiliating return,
he crept along to his hut, where he found
well-tied matting barring the entrance.
Tearing a way in, he saw that his camphor-
wood box and all his gear had gone; no-
thing was there but emptiness and dust.
Full of apprehension, he rushed out into the
street', to find Pomkini’s sty vacant and
grassgrown!
“Embo! Embo!” he shouted wildly.
“Aviri, where is my wife? My pig? My
box? Where are my pound-notes?”
In Bagi’s hut, the old constable, grey with
fear, shook the shoulder of the woman on
the sleeping-mat by his side, quavering
hoarsely, “Thy husband hath come from the
Abode of Spirits to claim thee. Haste thee
out to him. Embo, lest he enter in and
wreak his vengeance on me.”
Tossing the blanket from her head his
new wife sat up and said cheerfully, “If that
be Duna’s spirit, ’tis to the widows’ hut he
must go for liis wife.”
The light of dawn fell upon her face, and
Bagi’s jaw dropped in amazement and chag-
rin as he recognised Limomo rhe Wasp!
“Make no fuss, Bagi,” she hastened to
add. “Thou hast indeed been tricked, but
unless thou wouldst be for ever a byword in
Wamai, thou must take the wife the widows
have chosen for thee and make the best
of her.”
Cocking her ear to the shouting in the
street, she went on: “Husband, that is no
spirit that bellows outside for his pigs and
his pound-notes. It is Duna himself. Put
on thy Government clothes and show thy
face. Thou hast naught to fear.”
Chattering with rage and muttering curses
on the widows and on Duna, Bagi belted
on his rami, dragged his tunic over his bald
head, and, seizing his handcuffs, descended
the ladder as drums began to beat, conches
to blare and men waving firesticks came
pouring from ravi and huts.
Above the din came shrieks from the
widows’ hut, and Embo, having heard her
husband’s voice, came running towards hifti.
“Duna ! My man ! My man !” she sobbed,
and would have embraced him; but, furious
at the loss of his wealth, her husband held
her off, glowering at her close-shaven head,
sooty face and clay-daubed body.
“Pah, thou dirty jade!” he snarled in
anger and disgust. “What hast thou done
with my pig and my gear? Where are my
box and my pound-notes?”
“Alas!” she answered. “They are all
gone for thy funeral. Where hast thou
been? Did I not tell thee there would be
no luck if thou flouted the old customs?
Now see what hath come of it!”
Assured by the wrangling that Duna was
no spirit, a curious crowd had gathered
round, and the muttered approval that met
Embo’s words served to increase Duna’s
wrath.
“Then one old custom I will
follow, and may it bring me
luck,” he shouted furiously, slap-
ping her bare shoulders vigor-
ously. “There ! That will teach
thee to kill my pig and waste my
money !” With resounding smacks
he emphasised each word, ami his
wife, casting a glance of triumph
at the gossips, howled lustily.
A heavy hand fell on Duna’s
arm, and Bagi’s voice boomed,
“What’s this? Wife-beating,
thou disorderly fellow! I arrest
thee in the name of the law.
And” —addressing the crowd —"I
call upon ye all to bear witness
against him.”
“To gaol with the lawbreaker!”
came the ready response from
Duna’s father-in-law, trembling
at the thought of having to re-
turn the few pound-notes left of
his son-in-law’s wealth.
“Aye!” shouted the indignant
Aviri, who had recovered from
his fright. “Gaol the cheat who
pretended to be dead and de-
ceived honest men !”
“Aye, aye!” shouted the men
of the ravi who had eaten the
pig.
“To gaol with the wife-beater!”
screamed the women who had
taunted Embo and were stung
now by her triumphant look.
Bagi pushed back the crowd and flourished
his handcuffs under Duna’s nose.. In a
moment they would have encircled his wrists
had not Embo thrust a dirty, tear-stained
face between the two men.
“Arrest my man for wife-beating!” she
shrilled. “Here, Limomo, my aunt! Come
and take thy old dotard away before I
sharpen my nails on his scaly hide. Shame
on thee, letting him brawl on thy wedding
morn! Come, husband, let us leave these
ignorant bushmen, these sons of kawpis, to
stew their worn-out old customs in their
own cracked old pots. Let us go to the oil-
field, where there are plenty more pound-
notes to be picked up, and wo can dwell
amongst civilised folks.”
Casting a look of high disdain about her,
Embo took Duna’s arm, and. the gaping
crowd opening before them, husband and wife
went their way to the river, whilst from
the widows’ hut in the breadfruit grove came
a faint echo of chuckling laughter.
ALYS BROWN.
The Ghost.
GIRD you no more at poets. They have
sought
To utter the unutterable joy.
The gesture breaks the dream; acts ruin
thought,
Whose color is debased with gross alloy.
A leaping horse, a sea-pool clear and cold,
Night or her stars —these have not found
a name.
The rose is barbarous yet; and who has told
The frightful grandeur of a leaping flame?
Men have grown used to glory, let it pass
In powerless lassitude —vain, oh, so vain!
Are swept with glory as the wind the grass,
Drink and are silent as the rose the rain.
But poets, being fools, are not content;
They will name mysteries and utter most
Unutterable things; their blood is spent
In Beauty’s woundings—Beauty that’s a
ghost.

Wonderin’.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
THOUGH everythin’ looks pretty jake as
far as they nan see.
Some fellers will, for that’s their way, get
wonderin’ how she’ll gee.
They’re full of fight, they’re full of dash, and
"then they’ll hesitate;
They back arid fill, and in the end they make
their run too late.
But still you can’t be hard on them; they’re
really not to blame.
I’ve seen the time when I meself would come
at that fool, game.
I’d he right on for anythin’, then in the end
I’d twist ;
It makes me mad at times to think of chances
that I’ve missed.
I’ve seen the time when I would stand and
scratch my silly head,
And waste good time in listenin’ to what the
others said.
I'd try to think the matter out, I’d wonder
and suppose.
But now. when there’s a likely chance, I
simply say “Here goes!”
For life itsolf’s a game of chance, the kind
of game a man
Don’t want to think too much about, and it’s
the wisest plan
To take each likely chance that comes, the
smooth ones with the rough,
And if they’re crook—why, then, I guess
you’ll find out soon enough.
And, after all, it’s not the goal, though that
looks bright and fair
When it's a long way off. The fun of trying
to get there
Is better, you’ll find in the end, than all the
goals you’ll win.
And, oh! the fun a man must miss when he
starts wonderin’! '

Tyranny.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
“ r T"*HERE are all kinds of tyranny,” said
X the lame man ruminatingly, “tyranny
of flesh and blood—of pride—money
—pity. And by far the worst of these is the
tyranny of pity.”
The men smok-
ing by the fire
moved their . feet
in the fender, and
made grunting
noises indicative of
interest or assent.
“Yes,” continued
the lame man,
throwing one knee
negligently over the
other, “it is a
tyranny of the
worst kind. It has
its roots in sheer
emotion. It is im-
mune to cold rea-
son. It feeds on
nothing but itself.
It paralyses and
enervates. It has
you in silly muffling
chains from which
escape is impos-
sible. It’s”
He gave a short
laugh, and two list-
eners turned mild,
attentive faces towards him. He. was
Francis Keane, the artist. Thrust on
them two, days before, through the acci-
dent of a broken-down car on a country road,
he had proved himself a welcome addition
to their shooting party. He could talk, and
as he talked he gave you more of himself
than most people.
They looked at him expectantly, drawing
deep breaths of satisfaction. It was the
night for a story. On the iron roof of the
little public-house the wet boughs of the
pepper-trees scraped with a swishing sound,
and rain beat against the windows with a
sharp icy tinkle that was like glass beads
falling. The wind made a sighing song down
the chimney.
Keane threw his companions a consider-
ing look. He had a thin face that seemed
to be pulled to two points, one of which was
his long chin, the: other his nose. His eyes
were deep-set and touched by a malicious
humor.
“Oh, I know all about the tyranny of
pity,” he said. “I suffered hell under it.
I couldn’t cut loose, and I saw myself grow-
ing into a spineless weakling under it, in-
capable of delivering the blow that would
set me free for fear that it would hurt.
Hurt!” He stared into the fire, folding his
arms across his chest.
“It was like- this,” he said. “I had been
to a merry enough affair just out of the
city. _ Melbourne, of course. You know
the kind—-an informal gathering of people
with interests in common. When I got out
into the street, it was raining heavily, and
I waited in the shelter of the wall for a
taxi to arrive. There had come down the
steps with: me a young fellow who had hung
about all the evening on the outskirts of the
crow r d, obviously unattached to anyone, a
stranger. I hadn’t noticed him particularly.
You wouldn’t notice David Waller. He was
the kind that just leaves no impression at
all. A trunk and head, with eyes, nose,
mouth. Nothing more.
‘ W ell, we waited by the wall together,
’ ,! ollgll I stared in front, I knew that
the fellow was looking fixedly at me. Pre-
sently this persistent regal'd irritated me. I
turned round, and faced him full under the
light. In his eyes was the devout worship-
ping look that you expect to see in the eyes
oi a flapper faced with a matinee idol. It
disturbed me, that look. I was glad when
a taxi slid up and I could leave the shelter
' But do you think I could , get
into the taxi and leave that thin, huddled
figure standing in the rain? I couldn't,
though Cod knows I wanted to badly enough.
“ Tm going up to East Melbourne,’ I said
harshly. ‘lf you’re coming my way I could
give you a lift.’
“The young fellow accepted with such
alacrity that he bumped his head getting
in. The door slammed, and I knew that he
was going to talk. He did. He had been
trying to get near me all the evening, he
said. Had wormed a way into the gathering
on a passed-on doubtful invitation. I could
see what it was. My success in the art
world, the success of others —Mayne and
Minton and Farrar—had fired his imagina-
tion. He had wanted to establish some sort
of contact with those who had achieved what
he had himself failed to achieve.
“ ‘For I tell you.’ he said in that flat,
apologetic voice of his, ‘I was born to paint.
It was a hunger in me—a nasty gnawing
pain that would have stopped if I could
have got to a pencil.’
“He told me the story of his life in a
few jerky sentences while I sat back in
resigned quiet. A drab sort of story, no-
thing sensational or macabre in it. ' Com-
monplace, suburban family—father engine-
driver or something, poking fun at a weedy
son who preferred to potter round with paper
and pencil to learning a useful trade. At-
tended night classes at technical schools at
intervals, and appeared to have done rather
well—won a scholarship, but couldn’t avail
himself of it because of an accident that hap-
pened to his father. Feeling it incumbent
upon himself to put something in the family
plate, as it were, he got a job in a motor
garage and worked himself to a frazzle until
he lost the billet. Off and on his life seemed
to be a succession of small jobs, always with
that hunger for expression in color—so he
said—gnawing at his vitals. I wasn’t inter-
ested. I didn’t want to be interested, though
the story had all the makings of tragedy.
Probably he would have been a very good
builder or an excellent bricklayer, I thought,
without those impossible yearnings. Because
he could never do anything. He told me
SUCH A KIND HEART.
“Percy is the most considerate motorist I know.”
“Good heavens! Why, the man has run over half a dozen people.”
“Yes, I know. But he never goes anywhere without a trained nurse.”
with a feverish whining note in his voice
that he wouldn’t be able to paint now if he
were set down in the middle of beauty with
a brush and canvas for a year. For one
thing his hands were possessed of an exMn-
ordinary shakiness. He had the desire, tut
absolutely no execution,
“I murmured a few perfunctory words of
sympathy as the taxi came to a standstill
in front of the building where I lived. I
had a small flat on the second floor, you
understand, and my studio, a large, airy
room, was on the floor above. The taxi
rolled off, and the two of us were left on
tbe Pavement in the slanting rain. With
bis back bowed and his legs caved in at
the knees, he looked like an immense inter-
rogation-mark. I said good night rather
hastily.
“‘You live in the vicinity?’ I asked
him.
“‘I live anywhere where I can bed and
meal for sixpence,’ he said, jingling pennies
in his pocket. ‘For as God judges me, that
is all I have in the world. Good night, Mr.
Keane. It has meant something to me to
talk to you like this.’
“There was a dejected stoop to his shoul-
« > turnod away. I stood ton, be-
tween pity and irritation. I could imagine
how words had been eating him. He had
wanted to talk to someone. Mayim or Min-
ton or Farrar would have done equally well.
It had simply happened to fall on me. I
touched him on the arm. and he turned as
if he had been shot. Yon understand I
had not the shadowiest feeling of likine for
the follow. Not a tithe of that warm stir-
ring of regard that makes you think when
you drop on to some new acquaintance. ‘I am
going to find a ffiend in this p erson.’ No,
I was conscious only of an angry sense
of responsibility that had its roots in
pity.
“ ‘Better come in with me,’ I said, trying
to make my voice gracious. ‘There’s a bed
in a corner of the studio. I keep it there
for emergencies. You can’t go wandering
round the city on a night like this.’
“He accepted with a fawning meekness,
and I hurried on to get out of the reach
of his thanks.
“In the morning I had a better look at
him. He was older than I had imagined
him to be —quite thirty. He had hollow
cheeks and high cheekbones. A face that
might have been the face of a Slav —or a
melancholy painted mask. The woman of
the building brought breakfast up for two.
“ ‘I don’t know why you bother—-why you
are so confoundedly decent to me,’ he mut-
tered.
“ ‘Oh, that’s all right,’ I said hastily,
thinking, ‘Good Lord, the reason is obvious
enough! I simply couldn’t do anything
else!’
“Thus it was the whole damned thing
began. Watching him as he trailed round
the studio staring at my pictures with his
heart in his melancholy brown eyes, I felt
that to turn him out then and there would
be like kicking a dog out to starve. The
morning was excessively cold, and I could
see him shivering as he looked out of the
window on to a world that was washed over
with an ugly, pitiless grey.
“ ‘Look here,’ 1 told him, and I can re-
member how angry my voice sounded —as
though someone were pushing it out of me
from behind —‘I can fix you up with a job
for a few days. I can pay you by the
day. I was going to have the walls and
ceiling of this studio painted afresh, and
the floor re-stained and polished. I’ve let
it go because I couldn’t bear the idea of
cleaning all this junk out of the way to
make room for a couple of lazy workmen.
But if you can manage to do it, making
yourself and your paraphernalia au unobtru-
sive as possible—you said you had been a
while with a painter—l’ll take you on.’
“He accepted my offer, of course. Never
have I seen anyone put such fervor into
labor. He glorified that mean job into a
kind of sacred mission. He took down the
pictures, re-hung them and slapped away
at the walls as if he. were executing some
masterpiece. He would give himself no rest
lie worked on until I could see that his
back was breaking under the strain, and
when I suggested that he should sit for me
—I was on a street-group at the time, and
his thin, drained face exactly fitted in—he
sat until his body became agonised with
cramp.
‘‘lt was on the third day when he was
doing the ceiling that the miserable event
happened. He was up on a shaky pair of
steps that I had not cautioned him against
using—and they gave way under him
I heard the thud of his fall from the room
below and hastened up. His leg was
crumpled sideways, but he smiled through
ns pain and muttered something unintel-
ligible about au ‘ill wind.’ I got him off
to a hospital, and spent the rest of the day
contemplating the accident miserably, and
wondering how far I had been responsible.
I went often to the hospital to see him. I
hated going. The red floors—the smell of
anaesthetics and disinfectants —the bustling
self-important nurses with ugly, too-long,
draggling skirts. I detest hospitals. But
I knew that David waited. When I got to
the door the smile that irradiated his face
was like the light of a lamp.
“ ‘I knew you’d come just now, Mr. Keane,’
lie w ould say with a flood of red swirling
in the pool-like hollows of his young face.
‘I kmwv you'd come, because I felt that I
wanted cheering. You are a wonderful
friend.
‘‘And I would bite on my impatient words
and think commiseratiilgly, ‘Poor devil!
''hat has he had in life? Nothing but false
hopes and dreams and a stumbling chase
after beauty that has always been elusive.
After all, we were both the same at the be-
ginning. The same ideals, the same chaotic
imaginings. It may be that it is only .that
I have been more lucky.’
“When he left the hospital he walked with
a limp. ‘Lame like you, Mr. Keane,’ he said,
looking dark and unshaven as he came
out into the sun. And he .seemed to
glory in his lameness and wear it like a
crown. .......
“He came back to the studio as a matter
of course. I said that I would try to locate
a job for him, and that while he waited he
could be: useful about the place. The sight
of him meandering about the studio tidying
my things with an absorbed air irritated me
beyond measure. Little tricks of his speech
jarred me almost beyond endurance. I hated
the very way he tied the knot, of his thread-
bare tie over his prominent Adam’s apple,
the way he stared at me intently while I
worked. I was on a big thing at the time
for an overseas exhibition, and . had cut
things rather fine, which necessitated some
strenuous labor. I was using Chloe in this
piece. Chloe was an old model of mine Ayho
had returned at my request. A beautiful
creature, Chloe—-slim, still young, and strung
with life—the quintessence of life, qs it were.
Looking at Chloe I was always reminded,
I do not know why, of scarlet geraniums
growing against a black wall. She was the
most attractive creature about the studios,
and that I had kept my balance with her
for so long was a matter of congratulation
for both of us ; but that the balance was in
danger of being upset was becoming in-
creasingly evident. As I painted her there
with her shoulders rising creamy-gold out of
the silken folds of a Chinese shawl, my very
brush seemed heavy with the dreams I had
of her. How much she was aware of me
I did not know. She was a bewildering mix-
ture of madonna, coquette and child.
“It was with something approaching joy
that I landed a job for the young fellow. I
would be rid of him at last, rid of his meek
voice and husky gratitude l and poor, defence-
less-looking body. It was that defence-
less look of his, gentlemen, that would dry
up my dislike of his presence. To hurt him
would be like hurting a weak, innocent
puppy.
“Well, David went to his job—some
obscure position in a packing-house. But 1
was not rid of him yet. He told me that
he had secured a room in the same building,
and would batch there. It would be the very
thing, he said, because he would be close,
and could often run in to see me.
“What followed had to me the appearance
of a persecution which T suffered without
a word. He was singularly alone—appeared
to know nobody at all. I could not but be
sorry for that state of utter friendlessnqss.
I felt impelled—there was a kind of nioral
obligation about it—when I saw him hang-
ing about the doors to ask him in and
endure his platitudes with a stony face. If
I did not see him for a couple of days T
would hear a tap at my door. Hatred would
consume me as I strode towards it and
turned the handle.
“ ‘I thought you might not be busy for a
little while,’ he would say humbly. ‘lf you
are. don’t take any notice of; me, but - just
work away.’
“Work awrny! It was more easily said
than done. My work, subject to more than
ordinary interruptions, suffered consider-
ably.
“ ‘Get out of the damn place!’ I could
hear myself, shouting as I painted with slick,
feverish strokes. ‘Get out of the place! You
are nothing to me! Who asked you to attach
yourself to me, you damned meek little
whipper-snapper. Be off!’
. “But when I would turn and see him
sitting there, his back curved, his feet turned
in (they were such abject feet!), his eyes
fixed in a worshipping regard of the pictures
on the wall, I would feel that inevitable
stirring of pity and remember that this was
only a poor unbalanced creature with, that
greatest of all curses upon him—the hunger
for something outside himself which he could
never express.
“Sometimes after I had dodged him on
the stairs I would feel renewed compas-
sion and bring Ghloe’s forces to bear upon
things.
“ ‘Go out with the poor fellow,’ I would
say. ‘To a picture-play—to the fish-market
—any where!’
“And she would go, with laughter in her
eyes and a pout on her lips which made her
more adorable than ever.
“Smarting under the sense of wasted time,
I would work feverishly and paint out more
than I put in. I was painting vexation into
the picture of Chloe and her Chinese shawl
—not the magnificent dreams I had of her.
“‘He must go,’ I said to her. ‘l’ll tell
him that he must get out of here ! I can’t
stand him in the same building. Snooping
round —looking pathetic. Limping down the
passages. Making remarks about the
weather when I am thinking out a knotty
point. Pouring himself over my feet.'
“ ‘Poor boy!’ said Chloe pensively, stand-
ing with her hands on her hips. ‘l’m sorry
for him. He needs pity.’
“‘Pity!’ I shouted at her. ‘Pity! I’ve
got to murder my pity, do you hea'r! Got
to get rid of my cursed pity before I can
get rid of him! I’ve got to tear it out!
I’ve mucked up three months’ work on
account of it. That portrait won’t be
finished now for the exhibition, do you hear?’
I clasped her by the fleshy part of the arm.
‘Do you care, Chloe?’ I asked her. ‘Do you
love me?’
“‘Like that!’ said Chloe, and she kissed
me on the lips, light as a feather. She
laughed and her laughter stayed with me
after she had gone.”
* * * *
The lame man stopped talking and cleared
his throat twice.
“Well, did you get rid of your pity?”
asked one of his listeners.
“Yes!” He uncrossed his knees slowly.
“He and Chloe got married. God. knows
why ! But women are like that! Pity, then
love!” He laughed softly. “He had her!
Could I still pity him when he had what I
wanted most? At least, I was safe from
that tyranny.”
The lame man stood up and yawned. You
could hear the wet boughs on the roof.

A Bat Song.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
ALL through the summer night,
Velvet-warm summer night,
Circling in eerie flight
Flittermouse reigneth,
Needling the dark with fine flashes of sound
Round and around;
Gone dusky sapphire blue,
Yielding to vaguer hue;
Gone dying gold of the sun he disdaineth.
Now the wild rosemary, rosemary, rosemary,
Fairily luminous, flows into flower
Bower upon bower,
Frosted with whiteness, each bud a war-
daisy,
Breathing faint scent
Cunningly blent,
Till haloed about it the moths shimmer hazy.
Seaside wild rosemary’s fragrant of flower.
Wheeling from west to east,
Swooping to snatch and feast,
Tiny, uncanny beast,
Flittermouse hovers—
Four feet to crawl on earth, yet he has
wings!
Keenly he sings
Notes highly pitched and clear,
Baffling the human ear,
Shrill with that glee of the air he dis-
covers.
Now the wild rosemary, rosemary, rosemary,
Crosses with petals each slim thread of
leaf!
Night is so brief —
Sunset and sunrise reach arms across star-
light
Spraying the gloom
With a delicate bloom
Till the dawn kindles her first pearly far
light.
Flowering wild rosemary’s dainty of leaf!
All through the summer night,
Secret, short summer night,
Looping his silent flight
Flittermouse dances,
Turning in time to ethereal bars
Played by the stars—
Nerves pulsing sensitive
To the least throb they give,
Little grey elf strange sensation entrances!
Now the wild rosemary, rosemary, rosemary,
Spreads her wide snaring arms over the
earth
Jewelled with mirth,
Pointed with sparks of cool silver that glow
not;
Scatheless and swift
Bat-wings may lift,
Guided by exquisite feeling men know not,
Where the wild rosemary whitens the earth.
Wheeling from east to west,
Darting with vivid zest,
Skimming each bushy crest
Flittermouse twinkles
Dark in the darkness, and flutters unheard ;
Goblin mouse-bird,
Queer as a devil’s toy,
Innocent, drunk with joy,
Bathing in air that bright honeydew
sprinkles.
Now the wild rosemary, rosemary, rosemary,
Foams on the moors that slope down to
the sea.
Day for the bee —
Night for the moth’s pretty flirt of soft
pinion,
Loving pale flowers
In the perilous hours
When flittermouse measures his perfumed
dominion,
When the wild rosemary foams by the sea.
VICTORIA.

like about yours.”
at an old brick house on the left-hand side
of the thoroughfare, which, despite the
changed appearance given it by a cast-iron
balcony that has been added in comparatively
recent years, is still unmistakably as it was
A MISDESCRIPTION.
MAMIE (tired and bored to death, as clock strikes three ): “And pa said
he was ‘easy going’!”
when George the Fourth was king. An
oblong box of a place it is, with big, square
windows and a round fanlight over the door,
of the style of Australian architecture known
as Early Colonial —one of those plain, solid
and unpretentious edifices that retired civil
or military officers used to build for them-
selves in the old town when it wasn’t yet
much over thirty years of age and was the
social centre of Australia. “Harrisford,” it
is called now, but in 1832 it was The King’s
School, and remained so for about four years
whilst the big stone building in the old
Cherry-tree Gardens, across the river above
the Dam, was being erected to accommodate
the establishment presided over by the Rev.
Robert Forrest, M.A.
Approaching this somewhat, grim-looking
edifice, on, a sunny afternoon in the winter
of 1832, might have been perceived a very
tall gentleman with a very straight back, in
whose wake, like a little boat towed by a
smart frigate, trotted a small boy resplen-
dently arrayed in a- wholly new rig-
out of the sort then appertaining to the
juvenile male of the period who belonged to
the Quality. That little Tertius Hill-Jones
had every claim to such a distinction was
instantly to be understood from the aspect
of his father. If Captain Maurice Hill-
Jones, R.N., was not of the Quality, then
neither Sir Richard Bourke the Governor,
Mr. Blaxland of Newington, Mr. Macarthur
of Camden Park, nor that very important and
aged clergyman, then still a power in Parra-
matta, the Rev. Samuel Marsden, had claim
to be so either. His “quality” was visible
in everything that had to do with him—
from the faultless shape of his beaver top-
hat to his manner of taking
snuff. He couldn’t have had
more of it if he had been
First Lord of the Admiralty.
Tertius was very little,
and very rosy and flaxen,
and very frightened. Also,
he was very uncomfortable.
The quaint one-piece suit of
closely-fitting pepper-and-salt
tweed that buttoned behind,
with dummy brass buttons
ornamenting his valiant little
chest and well-fed tummy,
and the hard splendor of his
round, flat-topped cap with
shiny leather peak and dang-
ling tassel, constituted a sar-
torial purgatory that caused
him extreme illness of ease.
He had never in his short life
looked like this before, and
was morally certain that
occasional barefooted urchins
they passed in the street
were only restrained by the
terrible fierce presence of
Captain Hill-Jones, his
father, from immediately tak-
ing steps to ruin the raiment
that was his mother’s pride
and his own misery. He hated
himself in these clothes, and
knew well that every reason-
able and proper-minded boy
must hate him too. He loathed
The King’s School because
it seemed to demand such t.
frightful dress, and Mr. For-
rest because it had been put
on to impress that important
personage with the fact that
he was a Little Gentleman.
He didn’t want to be a
Little Gentleman. Little
Gentlemen were “sissy-boys.*’
Tom Dignum, who was a
First Fleeter and a very won-
derful and omniscient old
man, had told him that,
and Old Tom knew w J ia J' .T vas
ing about, whether what he said referred
to man, bird or beast. He d sooner have been
a convict m a chain-gang than a Tattle
Gentleman any day.
They walked up the short, brick-paved
path that led to the front door, and the
palpitating heart of little Tertius sank into
liis abdomen as he hearkened to the shrill
and clamorous voices of boys who whooped
and yelled to one another behind the house.
Soon they would be whooping and yelling at
Sissy-boy Hill-Jones, and the little fellow,
though he strove to be brave, took no com-
fort from the thought of what they would
do to him. His blue eyes rolled in his pink-
and-white head as he looked about for some
method of self deliver-
ance from the sorry
fate that seemed to
be impending.
Above the pathway
an arched trellis sup-
ported climbing roses,
and joined itself to the
flat front of the house
at the top of the arc
of fanlight that over-
topped the door. Cap-
tain Hill-Jones dealt
with the knocker so
that it sounded like a
battery of guns of
light calibre firing a
rapid salute. A fright-
ful silence ensued,
whilst Tertius
trembled with appre-
hensions vague but
dreadful. And then
suddenly divine in-
spiration came to him.
The Terror that Lurk-
ed was overcome by
direct action. With
remarkable prompti-
tude Tertius responded
to the Heaven-sent
notion.
As the hang, hang,
hang ! of the door-
knocker echoed a sec-
ond time from the
houses across the way,
the small boy deftly
and silently climbed up
the trellis at its outer , ~ . ~
end, wholly oblivious to the fact that tin.
loveliest of roses conceal thorns, and some-
how got along its top to the wall of the
house, where, just within his short reach, an
open window offered means of concealment
in the dark interior. The black, square aper-
ture had presented itself to the terrified
little rabbit as the only burrow within sight
where he might take refuge. So did lertius
Hill-Jones make his entry into The King s
School.
The door opened, and Mrs. Forrest con-
fronted the tall figure of Captain Hill-Jones,
looking at him inquiringly, a little smile of
welcome in her pleasant face. The polite
mariner raised his beaver.
“Mrs. Forrest? A very good day to you,
ma’am. I’ve brought my boy to school. The
porter at the Woolpack will bring his box
along presently. Tertius,” he turned to
where he had last seen his youngest son
drooping behind him. “Why, God bless my
soul! The little devil’s bolted!”
It was an amazing combination of circum-
stances that contributed to the escape of
Tertius and to his astounding disappear-
ance —a disappearance which remained an
unaccountable mystery until the following
September. So extraordinary are the facts
that the only conclusion to be arrived at
concerning them is that they were arranged
by Fate with a special view to the annoyance
of Captain Hill-Jones, R.N. This is, indeed,
the point of view which that gentleman was
wont to maintain until the day of his death
He nearly lost Mrs. Hill-Jones. A fond
mother cannot be other than grievously
afflicted by the sudden vanishing into no-
thingness of a sturdy little pink-and-white
son, with a shrill voice and blue angel eyes,
who is the baby of her brood.
When Tertius came to the window he
scrambled over the sill into the dark in-
terior of The King’s School, and fell down-
stairs head first. But a thing like that is
as nothing to the toughness of twelve-years-
old, and, although a little shaken after bump-
ing the ground floor, he pulled himself to-
gether, ran down the passage leading to the
back of the house, and fled into the open
ground behind it.
There was a detached building here that
was used as a schoolroom, with a young
Norfolk Island pine growing at the nearer
end. (The tall old tree has only recently
been cut down owing to its being ancient
and decayed and dangerous to “Harrisford.”)
As he shot through the back door Tertius
found himself in an empty garden, his school-
fellows having retired hurriedly and clam-
orously to the back of the isolated building
to attend to one of those sudden, fierce fights
so joyously congenial to the savage tempera-
ment of the schoolboy. In front of the fugi-
tive was an imminent steep place that he
recognised as the bank of the river, the
nearly-sheer clay cliffs of the northern shore
rising on the other side of the gulf beyond.
He sped through a tangle of rank weeds, and
plunged into the abyss unnoticed by any
of the lads whom he was declining to accept
as mates.
Passing down the stream, in the beginning
of her return voyage to Port Jackson, was
the white whaleboat of H.M. Colonial brig
Governor Phillip, with Mr. Bill Blades,
lately of the Royal Navy, standing at the
long steer-oar in the stern. She had come up
the river on the morning tide to make a
call at Parramatta Gaol, which stood in
those days close beside the present situation
of The King’s School, and was returning
on the ebb bearing three prisoners, lately
members of a Bathurst firm of bushrangers,
who. having barely escaped the gallows, were
destined for the Hell-in-Heayen known as
Norfolk Island —a dispensation of the mercy
of Providence they much regretted.
Coxs’n Blades, comfortably full of beer
from the Ploughman’s Arms, absorbed during
the boat’s long wait below the Dam, was sud-
denly startled to see a small pepper-and-salt
figure leap over the edge of the high bank on
his starboard bow, roll and bounce down the
steep declivity, and splash into the water
near the boat.
“Gawd !” he shouted. “Hold her, lads —
back water all! Well, bust me!”
Almost more quickly than it takes to tell
was Tertius rescued from a watery grave in
the muddy stream and hauled into the stern-
sheets, where he lay gasping on the bottom
of the boat between Bill Blades’s big bare
feet. In the meantime the boat had drifted
fifty yards down stream on the strong cur-
rent, and was nearly ashore, so that it took
all the coxswain’s resources in seamanship
to save her from shipwreck.
“Back water, labbardside!” he yelled.
“Now pull, ye cripples! An’ who th’ devil
may yon be, me young water-rat?” he in-
quired of Tertius.
A FELLOW FEELING.
WARDER: “Wot do you want this time o’ night?"
THE LATEST BOARDER: “Could I please have another blanket? I
can’t bear to listen to the poor little fleas sneezing all night."
By this time the boat was far down the
river below the school, Captain Hill-Jones,
K.N., was furiously legging it up George-
street in the direction of the Woolpaek, and
Mrs. Forrest was acquainting her husband
with the astonishing behavior recently mani-
fested by that distinguished retired naval
officer, who had run away yelling while she
was still in the act of welcoming him.
“Ah, well, my dear,” said Long Bob to
Slender Jane, “we must expect to encounter
some queer characters in the colony. He’ll
come back. I suppose the little fellow really
did run back to the Woolpaek to his mother.
It often takes them that way.”
“By gum!” softly murmured Coxswain
Blades, “by gum!” when Tertius had pre-
sently acquainted him with his name, address
and parentage. “Be th’ Lord ’Arry, ’tis
th’ rummiest go’s hever been goed, I declare
it is! W’y, you liddle w’ite rat, d’ye know
y’r fawther’s th’ bluddiest-minded tyrant -wot
hever trod a quarter-deck? A proper cow, as
th’ Currency Lads say. I’ve never seed
th’ like! No, I’ll be d—d if I ’ave! It
beats cock-figlitin’, it do !”
They were a couple of miles beyond the
boundaries of Parramatta when Mr. Blades
thus expressed his amazement at the inscrut-
able ways of Providence, and the stately
buildings of Mr. Blaxland’s home at New-
ington lay back across marshy flats from
the widening river. He stooped forward,
resting on the steer-oar, and addressed the
startled but tearless little boy.
“Look ’ere,” he said. “You listen to me,
sonny. I ain’t got no manner o’ down on
you, liddle man, but I’ve got an ’ell of a
down on y’r fawther. I owes ’im one —I
owes ’im two or three! This’ll be a lark to
you, I makes no manner o’ doubt, but it


won’t be no lark to Mister Cap’n 111-Jones,
my oath it won’t! I’ll give th’ Worsted
wretch somethink to worry hover! -Now,
’ark to wot I’m a-tellin’ of ye, me liddie
sixpenn’orth o’ ha’pence—you pay attention.
Th’ skipper o’ th’ Gov’nor Phillip, ’im bein
a proper dyed-in-th’-wool gent.—not like your
old covey, stiffen’ ’im—’e’s give me_ leave for
to take my boy Jim to Nuffick Hisland for
WHAT SHE GOT TO GROWL AT?
BELLE: “It’s not fair —the woman always pays.”
BILL: “Sure she does. But don’t she always borrow the money from a man?”
th’ trip, and w’en we gets aboard you’re
a-goin’. to be young Jim. Now then, me
boy, how/ll you like that there—for to sail
a v’yage in a Gov’ment ship, wi’ sojers an’
lags? Jimmy can wait. You won’t come
to no ’arm, boy. I’ll look arter ye. An’
ye’ll be back in Sydney inside o’ two months,.
an’ can then go back to y’r mammy. ’Twiil
make a man o’ ye, laddie. I’ll teach ye
for to be a sailor—an’ they’d cn’y ha’ made
a lubber o’ ye at that there college ye’ve
up an’ bolted from. Now, what d’ye say
to that, ole cockalorum ? A bold an’ bully
fife at sea, or back to doin’ sums wi’ norsty
schoolboys wot don’t know a marline-spike
from a lianchor? ’Ow d'ye like that idee?
Well, ye’d better begin a-likin’ of it, for ’tis
wot’s agoin’ to ’appen. Now, then, wot ye
got to say to that? ’
Tertius screwed his apple of a face into
wrinkles in an effort of concentration that
was a little troublesome. There was his
mother—but, on the other hand, there were
those abominable clothes. Presently he
looked up into the whisker-fringed, brick-red
countenance of Mr. William Blades, and
nndrWi «nl P rrmlv
nodded solemnly
Please, sir, I d like to be a sailor.
“An’ so you shall, fiddle Snowy! You’d
oughter to be one be hinstinck, for whatever
helse y r ole may be, e s a d d good
sailorman. But 111 make a gennleman out
o ye, w ich e never could ha did, not bein

The queer little mite in the cut-down pea-
jacket with rolled-up sleeves that was being
addressed by Coxs’n Blades on the fo’c’s’le-
head of the Governor Phillip, as she lay at
anchor south of the Sow and Pigs in Port
Jackson awaiting the arrival of the naval
officer on her return from Norfolk Island,
was a very different atom of humanity from
the one that had dived into the Parramatta
Biver on the afternoon six weeks before when
we made his acquaintance at the front door
of The King’s School. There was an air of
sturdy embryo manhood about him altogether
unlike that of the scared little lad who had
followed his stern parent up George-street
on that memorable occasion.
“Now, ’ark to me, young Terry,” Bill
Blades was saying, “an’ see an’ do wot I
tells ye. Ye’ll take this ’ere ten shillin’ an'
pay y’r coach fare to Parrymatty. An’ then
ye’ll go an’ report y’rself on th’ quarter-deck
o’ that there college ye done a bolt from,
Go stright back an’ be a fiddle man abart
it. An’ don’ forgit for to lead wi’ th’ left
an’ counter to th’ jor wi’ th ’right, like I’ve
taught ’ee, w’enever you ’as to put up y’r
dooks wi’ hany o’ y’r shipmates. No doubt
yell ’ave a main o’ fightin’ to do for ’avin’
bin a sailor an’ a man w’en them mothers’
darlin’s was on’y schoolboys, a-gettin’ of
their fiddle starns rope’s-ended. Not a doubt
of it. I’ll get ye a passage to Sydney Cove
in th’ naval hofficer’s boat, an’ mind an’
go stright back to Parrymatty. No shippin’
aboard a South Sea w’aler or nothink like
that. D’y’ ’ear wot I’m sayin’?”
“Yes, Mister Blades, but I don’t like
leavin’ you,” replied the little boy. “Father’ll
be terrible— terrible. He’ll have you hung.”
Bill Blades patted his young friend on the
shoulder, and his great hairy paw rested
there a moment or two affectionately.
“I’ll be all right, son. I’m shippin’ meself
on th’ Two Sisters, w’aler, an’ goin’ away
a 3 boat-steerer. So don’t you worry. You
tell y’r fawther from me ’e’s a ole son of a
gun, an’ ’ow I ’opes nothink good’ll come
to ’im. Now, don’t forgit them words. Say
’e’s a ole son of a gun, an’ ’ow Bill Blades
’ates ’im. Ye'll do that, Terry—for a hold
shipmate?”
“Yes, I will, Mister Blades,. and when I m
a captain I’ll make you mate.”
“That’s th’ style, boy. An’ w’en you re
a cap’n I know _ ye’ll treat pore sailormen
right—not like y’r blorsted dad used fer to
do. Gi’s y’r fist, sonny—y’re a reel fiddle
man!”
Towards evening the little man again pre-
sentcd himself at the front door of The
King’s School, greatly to the bewilderment
of Mr. and Mrs. Forrest. His tarpaulin hat,
peculiar nautical rig-—the hated garments of
sissyhood had been cast into the Pacific early
i n the voyage to Norfolk Island—and wide-
awake appearance put him in a class of
boyhood utterly outside the headmaster’s
experience. And he was chewing a quid of
tobacco and spitting manfully on the brick
pathway as he proclaimed his identity in
very singular terms unfamiliar to both of
them.
“Come aboard, y’r honor,” he said touch-
ing his forelock with a tarry forefinger, as
he had seen Bill Blades do when first he
made the acquaintance of the Governor
Phillip brig. “All present an’ c’rect, sir.
D—n me heyes, sir, I’m glad to see you!”
u „,, , , . .
Mr. Forr « st ’ ookod do . wn \ n
at thc sunburnt mannikin who confronted
him at the door. He spoke over his shoulder
to b is w if e> who stood in the passage
behind,
u ear » said wonderinglv. “vou
] iavon ’t by any chance hired a little boy to
work about the house, have you? What’s
y OUr name, my lad—and what do you want,
pray? And you needn't swear, you know.
It isn’t done here.”
<t ™ TT .,, . T , , _ ,
, T Tertius Hill-Jones, sir. Ive been >
Noffick Island, and learned to be a sailor, but,
please, sir, Mr. Blades said I was to come
straight back to The King s School an
wasnfito go a-wliafin I d like to ha gone
chafin’, sir. Dye think I might now?
“Heavens, my dear!” exclaimed the head-
master, “I think it’s Captain Hill-Jones’s
little boy. Gracious, my lad, where did
you get those clothes? Come in—come in
and tell me all about it. Jane, my dear, we
must find a messenger—a mounted messenger
—and send instant word to the boy’s father
at Mulgoa. I’ve never heard of such a
startling thing! Eh, what? liaised from
the dead ! I should think so! God bless
m y s °nl
We must pass over the immense to-do
incidental to the return of Tertius to the
halls of learning; the amazement and wrath
of his father, who scoured Sydney in search
of Bill Blades, all unavailingly, since he
would have done better had he looked in
Bass Strait; of his mother’s joy, that kept
Tertius at home for the remainder of the
year; of the thrashings he underwent at his
father’s hands in the painful process of
acquiring a vocabulary more refined than
that in vogue in the fo’c’s’le of a convict
transport. So we now come to his return to
The King’s School after the Christmas holi-
days, and the stress and glory and tribula-
tion incidental to having been the boy-who-
ran-away-to-Norfolk - Island- and - became - a
hero, and was now expected to take his
place as a common schoolboy,
The baby-boy of twelve had become a
truculent little hard-case during the voyage
in the Governor Phillip—he could swearlike
an able-bodied seaman, smoked and chewed
tobacco whenever he could get it, refused to
weep under the frequent efficient callings
administered by Mr. Forrest, and habitually
“looked for fight.” The aggressive swagger
of his nautical roll was an eyesore to Mrs.
Forrest and a glory to his schoolfellows.
From the moment his adventures became
known to them they accorded him an exalted
place in their democratic community which
lie was frequently called upon to defend.
Terry Hill-Jones became a leader of little
men, and it is to be acknowledged, regret-
fully, that he more frequently led them into
schoolboy crime than along the paths of
virtue and law-and-order.
One forenoon, at the end of morning school,
Mr. Forrest detained the boys in the detached
schoolroom behind the house, whilst he issued
a general order or proclamation of the sort
by which the early Governors of New South
Wales were wont to indicate their policy.
“Just a word,” he said, “before I dismiss
you. This afternoon is the usual Wednes-
day half-holiday, when you will be free
to go into the bush surrounding the town,
bird-nesting, or what you will. But you will
please remember this. I have complaints
of stolen fruit from one or two of the
orchards beyond the Government Domain,
and will severely flog any boy who is re-
ported to me specifically for having robbed
any of the farmers of the neighborhood.
That, however, is not what I wish chiefly
to tell you now. This afternoon, I under-
stand, three unfortunate men, convicted of
piracy, are to bo executed publicly on the
open ground in front of the gaol. North
of the river, therefore, will be out of bounds
for the day. Should any boy be seen pre-
sent at the hanging of these men, I will not
only flog him so that he will not readily
forget the experience, but will expel him
from the school and send him home. These
debasing spectacles, which should never be
exhibited in public, are not to be witnessed
by boys of The King’s School, and shall not
be. Upon that I am inflexibly determined.
Bear in mind what I say. Expulsion is the
penalty. So do not cross the river on any
account. If a boy is found on the iCastle
Hill side of the river to-day I will assume
that he has been to the execution, and will
treat him accordingly. Now, mind what I
say. That is all. The school is dis-
missed.”
Mr. Forrest was a great man, and a wise
one —a hundred years have placed him in
his rightful niche—but he was not very
wise that summer morning in 1833. No
more direct invitation to the execution could
have been issued. If he had refrained from
mentioning it nobody would have taken the
trouble to cross the wooden bridge in order
to stand with the morbid and ribald mob who
watched three wretched men die a shameful
death. But after such occupation of the
afternoon had been publicly banned, what
was to be expected? No healthy-minded boy
but would long to see the ultimate end of
three pirates.
Mr. Forrest congratulated himself that he
was unable to sec a single boy of The King’s
School crossing over the river amidst the
motley throng which streamed towards the
gaol. He forgot how well he had taught his
boys to swim, amongst other manly exercises
so necessary to the ideal of mens sana in
corpore sano.
The seething mob eddied and circulated
behind the flat backs of a line of soldiers
DRESSING A LA MODE.
MERO (just returned from working with white folk ): “They called me the valet and I
helped to get visitors all ready for kai-kai.”
KEKENI: “Ooh! You help the cook-boy!”
that kept it from the immediate vicinity of
the gallows, whose long black beam stretched
itself between its supporting uprights imnrm-
diately in front of the prison gates. The
execution had been , timed for 3 p.m. so as
to suit the convenience of spectators from
Baulkham Hills, Dundas, Prospect and even
from the Plawkesbury. Cartloads of merry
children camped on the high bank of
the river, where they had boiled the mid-
day billy, and all waited impatiently for
the appearance of the pirates of Sackville
Reach. Immediately below the gallows
Masters Hill-Jones, Mortimer Secundus and
Billy Florence occupied strategic positions
in the front of the crowd, where the first-
named young gentleman delivered a lecture
on penology, with special consideration of
capital punishment as a deterrent, to his
fascinated companions. They readily recog-
nised that one who had been to Norfolk
Island —a place people referred to with
bated breath in those days—was peculiarly
competent to explain things. Tertius had
risen vastly in their esteem —especially as he
had the good taste to chew a quid of tobacco
and expectorate copiously on to the shadow
of the black beam that lay along the grass, as
one who was familiar with “galluses” and
didn’t give a hang for them.
“Yes, you’ll see,” explained Master Hill-
Jones condescendingly, “they’ll come outer
th’ gaol door with Mr. Ketch in front. Yes,
that’s his name. His brother was at Noffick
Island. An’ there’ll be two peelers holdin’
on to each man’s elbows, an’ they’ll guide
’em up them wooden steps, an’ stand ’em
in a row underneath them ropes that’s hang-
in’ down. An’ Mister Ketch he’ll go along
an’ put th’ ropes round their necks, an’
blin’fold ’em, an’ then he’ll say ‘All ready,
sir!’ to the boss cove, an’ he’ll ask ’em what
they’ve got to say, an’ after they’ve finished
skitin’—one cove at Noffick Island says ‘To
Hell with th’ lot o’ ye!’ —when they ain’t
got any more to say, the boss cove’ll say ‘Do
your duty, Executioner !’ an’ Mister Ketch’ll
take a big hammer an’ knock a bolt out, an’
tlr floor’ll fall down an’ leave ’em kickin’ in
th’ air.”
“Oh, Terry, will they do that?” gasped
little red-headed Mortimer, very pale, and
with a voice that quavered a trifle fearfully.
“Oh, will they do that?”
“All wriggly an’ squirmy,” explained Ter-
tius. Then he became contemptuous.
“You’re goin’ to be sick, Carrots! Poor
little darlin’! Look at him, Florrie !” But
Master Florence had fled, and was hiding his
eyes in his hands as he rocked his little
body to and fro below the top of the river-
bank.
A minute or two later, as the three dying
men struggled convulsively, and the crowd
roared in a muffled, brutish way, the tall
figure of Mr. Forrest stooped over the, sense-
less form of pale little Mortimer Secundus.
He picked him up and draped him over one
muscular forearm. With his disengaged hand
he held Tertius by the ear, and began to force
a way through the crowd.
“Make way, there!” cried the tall clergy-
man. “Make way! Brutes —brutes —
brutes!” he muttered unconsciously, as he
bore his burden and led his prisoner back
towards the bridgehead.
Next day Mr. Forrest did his best to
soften the blow to Captain Hill-Jones.
“My dear sir, he is a fine little fellow —
a fine, lovable little chap. Manly to a
degree. We are both—Mrs. Forrest and my-
self —desolated at losing him. But he must
go. There is no help for it. I cannot
retract. But I wish you had seen the brave
look of the dear little fellow when he took
all the blame of leading the other boys astray,
An honorable little gentleman, Captain Hill-
Jones—a little man! He’ll do you credit
one day. Is he for the Navy?”
“If he survives!” said Captain Hill-Jones
grimly.

THE WELL-WISHER.
AS yesternoon alone I strode
Upon a footworn way
That over hill and hollow flowed,
I met a swagman grey.
A swagman grey, and yet not old,
For this I tell in truth
That from his big, brown eyes there shone
A light of laughing youth.
“For me,” he said —I caught my breath
To hear so strange a thing—
“ There is no death, can be no death,
While Christmas greetings ring;
In spite of all that hate may do,
In spite of age and time,
.Well-wishing through the world I go
When bells at Christmas chime.
“And this,” he said, “this is my wish,
Go spread it far and wide:
May meat and bread on each man s dish
Make this true Christmastide;
May plenty be at each man s board,
And, be it great or small,
May there be love in each man’s house
With rich goodwill for all. .
“And this I wish—may there be mirth
And laughter free of pain
In each and every home on earth
Till I stroll round again;
Though oft and oft my heart I’ve voiced
Unheard, un-understood,
Once more I wish to see all lands
Clasp hands in Brotherhood.”
We parted, and alone I strode
At golden noon of day
Upon that ancient, footworn road,
While he, the swagman grey,
The swagman grey so bright of eye,
So blithe of word of tongue
Warm-wishing all the best of all,
Upon his world-round swung.

Jonathan's Married a Fairy.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
JONATHAN’S married a fairy!
But how could Jonathan tell
That the winsome maid he courted,
Was a fairy under a spell?
Married beneath the steeple,
With ring and book and bell,
And the decent work-day people
To nudge and wish him well!
Jonathan’s married a fairy,
But how could Jonathan tell?
The parson stood at the railing
And watched her, white and still.
“Will you cherish this man, and love him?”
And she solemnly said “I will!”
And who could tell by the looking
That her heart was far away
Over the marshy reaches
Where the wheeling plover screeches,
Over the wrinkled beaches,
With the gulls and the whirling spray?
Jonathan’s wife is small and frail,
And her cheeks are pale
As a summer rose ;
But she laughs and sings at her work all
day,
Setting the milk in the cool, "dark dairy
(Tiresome tasks for a spellbound fairy),
Dusting the walls on the tips of her toes,
And drying the cups on the soapy tray.
But at night with a secret smile she goes
Out of the house when the moor-wind blows.
And Jonathan, Jonathan, Jonathan knows!
Nights in bed poor Jonathan stirs,
And wakes to find that he lies alone;
And the running steps on the tiles are hers,
And hers the laughter eerily blown;
And, drawn by the threads of that eerie
laughter,
He creeps by the wall and follows after.
Over the colibly pave he passes,
Over the leaning, dew-drenched grasses,
Till he loses her down where the poplars
hide
In the purple depths of a noiseless tide.
“Alas,” moans Jonathan, sad and cold,
“Must I pray till I’m thin of limb and old
For the joy of a warm and white bedfellow,
Under the candle’s dwindling yellow!”
Jonathan pines for woman’s love,
Eor a rich curved body made for blisses,
Eor a mouth that craves a mead of kisses,
For a look as shy as a frightened dove ;
And tramping home in the autumn eves,
Pushing his way through the high-piled
leaves,
He sees each night the teamster’s daughter
Standing beside the grey lake-water,
Waiting to catch him as he goes.
And Jonathan knows that she loiters there,
With the wind in the ropes of her coarse,
black hair
And her hands pressed down on her insolent
hips,
To give him the pride of her ripe young
lips.
But Jonathan purses his mouth in vain
And gives one look, nor looks again.
Jonathan’s married a fairy!
Alone he lies at night,
Waiting for her returning
With her feet all frosted white.
And he thinks of the teamster’s daughter
Beside the gray lake-water.
And his heart leaps up and. cries!
For Jonathan’s married a fairy.
And must have her till he dies!
VICTORIA.
MYRA MORRIS.
Blue Gum.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
THE spurs of the Australian trooper sank
deep in the Assyrian sand. A fierce sun
flared on the squat roofs of Shad-el-
Marisli. The soft voice of Hasan, the
donkey-boy, announced the Australian’s com-
ing within the Bazaar of the Sleeping Priest.
THE MAN WHO SCORED.
“Harry gave her a new car for her thirtieth birthday."
“Yes. But she married John, who only gave her a birthday cake.”
“Ah, but remember he only put twenty-one candles on it!”
“Inside the Bed Shrine, effendi, is Biram
the sleep-talker. He will speak of thy dead
brothers, killed on the Biver. He knoweth
of men’s doings from Suvla to Damascus.”
The Australian trooper pushed his way
down the crowded bazaar, halted at the silk-
draped door of the Bed Shrine before enter-
ing. An oil-lamp swung from a rod. under
the roof; a smell of myrrh and frankincense
drenched the stagnant air. On a divan of
faded ruby red reclined an age-shrunken
priest, a ‘pair of thin transparent hands
folded over his breast.
“God be with thee, Biram!” the trooper
greeted in bazaar Arabic. “I have come
from the war camp on the Tigris for thy
advice.”
The transparent hands made a sign.
“Come nearer and tell me thy name. Let
me see thy face. Now —speak.”
The Australian stood at ease, smiling
thoughtfully in the uncertain light of the
heavily draped enclosure. “Men know me
as Starlig’lit,” lie said. “I come from over-
sea because my people are fighting for a
cause on holy ground.”
The muscles of the priest’s face seemed
to vibrate like the strings of a violin.
“Then God be with you, too, friend,” he
intoned sweetly. “I am but a dreamer in
the valley of shadows. How can I help
one whose arm is as strong as the blades of
Damascus?”
Starlight drew breath sharply. Burning
incense and myrrh
brought a memory of
a little shrine he had
visited at Bethlehem a
week before. It was
some time before he
spoke. Then;
“I have a friend,
Biram, a soldier like
myself, but younger.
Two days ago he was
in the hills of Shirah
with his company to
destroy a Turkish
observation post. He
was made prisoner
after every member of
his company had been
killed. The Turkish
Commandant, Endred
Pasha, has just de-
cided on his life.”
“It will be a sol-
dier’s de a t li,” the
priest murmured, and
paused irresolutely.
Starlight shrugged
his big shoulders. “The
death Endred has
chosen for my friend
is fit for the killers of
little children. Endred
has given the word for
him to be stripped and
staked out for the jackals.
Biram shook his head. “No philo-
sophy of mine can save your friend.
But there may he much solace for thee
in the killing of Endred. He fears
death as the harlot and the pariah
fear it.”
Starlight was silent, and the droning of
native voices within the bazaar beat like a
subdued song on his listening senses. After
a while he spoke :
“Endred has eight thousand fighting men
to protect his beard. I would not be allowed
within a mile of his hooked nose.”
“Endred is only one,” the priest retorted.
“He is not eight thousand.”
Starlight pondered his words .as he
listened to the queer sounds of this little
Eastern war-frontier, the squalling, bicker-
ing voices of the donkey-boys and porters,
the high acclaim of the vendors of sherbet
and perfume. Also, he was thinking of the
young lieutenant whose life-hours were
running out.
He had not come to Biram under a super-
stitious impulse. The fame of the old priest
was as wide as Egypt and tli e deserts beyond.
Mem came to Biram when all hope had been
abandoned elsewhere, for they knew that the
secret whisperings of a thousand bazaars
reached him sooner or later.
Moreover, he was the sworn enemy of the
Turkish Commandant, the man whose
armies had desolated Christian and Hebrew
territory. It may have happened that
morsels of Endred's high strategy had
drifted into the little Bed Shrine.
“Tell me, Biram,” Starlight said in his
drawling tone, “how will the killing of
Endred save my friend Noel Chanter. How
shall I traverse the miles of enemy trenches,
alone, when the armies of my people cannot
—as vet?”
“Go to Endred as a pilgrim, a reader of
the Koran, or as a deserter from your own
side.”
A weary grin touched the face of the
Australian trooper.
“In my country, Biram, we say such
things to children. I thought you might
help save Chanter,” he went on steadily.
“They say in these parts that a man lives
until you will it otherwise. The grey-haired
woman my friend calls mother keeps a sneep-
farm in my country. She slaves even as
the Arab women on the Nile so that this
lieutenant-son will have a roof and a bed
when he comes out of this fighting. You are
a priest, Biram; you know how such a
woman feels when there comes to her a
message saying that her boy has been shot
and that he will be buried where the sunset
will keep his feet warm for a thousand
years.”
A touch of red stained the priest’s pallid
cheeks. “We must come back to Endred,”
he murmured. “There are roads that lead
to death and" there are roads that lead to a
fool. To-day a ship called the Parthia entered
this port. When you have found her you
will have decided your friend’s fate.”
“The Parthia?”
“Ask for Captain Ishmail. Give him the
sign—‘Allah and Endred.’ Tell him you
must take the dogs to Endred. Believe me,
you will get through to your friend.”
LITERALLY.
“D’you hear Millie’s suing Ted for breach of promise?”
“Millie! Oh, ring off!”
“Yes—the poor girl returned it last week.”
“But these clothes of mine?” Starlight
protested.
“Kir Mali, the Armenian, at the end of
the bazaar, will lend you others if you speak
my name. Go now.”
Starlight swung out of the Red Shrine as
one in the grip of a dreadful mystery.
Kir Mali had the face and whiskers of
an Egyptian grain-rat. A hint of the Aus-
tralian’s mission, coupled with the name of
Biram, put all questions of remuneration
out of the way. Starlight emerged from
the little shop wearing a nondescript turban
and costume that one sees everywhere in the
streets of Assyrian towns.
From the bazaar to the quay was a short
walk. A Government wharf afforded berth-
ing accommodation for half a dozen fruit
steamers from Jaffa and Aleppo. A native
clerk guided him to a low-hulled banana
tramp" with the name Parthia under her
rusting anchor chains.
Captain Islimail was not on board. Ho
was to be found, however, within the white
stone residence at the entrance to the wharf.
Thanking his informant, Starlight walked
leisurely to the gate of the house, where he
became aware of the presence of howling
dogs somewhere within an iron-roofed shed
at the rear of the residence.
Halting at the gate he looked up quickly
at the face of a woman scrutinising him
from behind the brass window screen. She
made no effort to withdraw as he returned
her glance. By her costume he knew she
was a nurse. But the fact that impressed
him most was that he had met her at a
military hospital at Suez some months be-
fore, when. Chanter was recovering from an
attack of fever. A further effort of memory
convinced him that she had nursed Chanter
through the worst period of his illness.
Furthermore, she had the distinction of
being French.
The window with the brass screen was
opened softly. Her lips fluttered as she
beckoned him nearer.
“Tliees ees the house of Capateen Ish-
niail,” she informed him in a whisper that
proved she saw through his disguise. There
was a momentary flash of curiosity in her
eyes. , . , .
Starlight felt the hot sun searching his
bare neck in the unsheltered gateway. The
sobbing howls of the dogs in the shed ran
like a fluid through his tense-drawn nerves.
“Chanter’s a prisoner in Endred Pasha s
camp,” he told her. •
She nodded as she cast a frightened glance
across the blind-darkened room beyoiifl. The
foolish boy ! He will nevair come back. Why
do you seek Islimail?” . .
“Because I’m a special commissioner of
dogs, Ma’m’selle Marie.”
Her name came with the first breath of
perfume from her dark hair. Chanter had
carried a bottle of that perfume in his valise,
together with a handful of very dead violets
which Marie had worn on the night of a
military hall in Cairo. ITe watched the
fluttering of her lips.
“Ishmail ees in Endred’s pay, she warned
him. , . ,
“So are you,” lie gave back without a
shift of his steel-grey eyes.
Marie’s small hands were clenched on the
stone casement; the carmine of her lips had
grown ashen.
“I came from Jaffa with Ishmail’s wife,
Monsieur. I am now her nurse. She ees
sick in tliees house. We brought two blood-
hounds from Jaffa for the Pasha Endred.
Ishmail is feeding them over there.”
“Bloodhounds!” His surprise ivas dra-
matic. “Then I take them to Endred. Any
message for Chanter, Ma’m’selle?”
“For Chanter? You are mad!”
“Maybe,” he admitted with a grin. “Sort
of madness that afflicts mules and calves.
Anyway, Chanter hadn’t any more brains
than you could press through a slot machine,
or. he’d have beat it when those Turks got
too busy. As I mentioned to an old man
who dreams for a living, it’s Chanter's
mother who’ll do the crying if the jackals
get him.”
“Jackals, Monsieur?” Marie flinched as
though naked steel had touched her.
“Yes, jackals. The Turks feed them with
crucified officer-boys. You couldn’t dream a
worse kind of death. The kids are just roped
to a cross, and the jackal provides the enter-
tainment.”
In the grim silence that followed Starlight
was afflicted with another effort of memory
in connection with Chanter’s past. But even
in liis mental preoccupation he noted how
the healthy red had faded from Marie’s
cheeks.
“I remember,” lie said after a while, “a
hip,- kangaroo-dog of Chanter’s that was a
prize-winner in Sydney. Up at Ganderra,
where his mother lives, it used to hunt a
lot. Old Blue Gum it Was called ; heavy as
a man and fast as a rocket. Old Blue Gum,
Ma’m’selle.”
Marie looked up quickly. “No d’s mother
sent the dog, to lieein in Cairo. The Colonel
would not have it as ze mascot. Poor Noel
was in great distress. So I promise to look
aftair ol’ Blue Gum until ze war ees over.
It was a secret wit’ me an ze boys of ze
Dingbat battalion.”
Starlight scratched a sun-frizzled ear
thoughtfully. “The dog was a pup in Noel’s
hands,” he commented. "It wouldn’t hurt,
maybe,” he added slowly, “if old Blue Gum
travelled along with me.”
“What can ze dog do, Monsieur?”
“Nothing, Ma’m’selle; only it gives a fel-
low a comfortable feeling to have a big
dingo-chaser like Blue Gum in the bill when
you haven’t another friend between you and
kingdom come.”
The head of Captain Ishmail was thrust
from the door of the dog-liouse as Star-
light approached. The jaw and head of the
Levantine appeared to have been forged from
a copper ingot. There were ncwly-liealed
scars on his cheeks that might have been
caused by a grenade or shrapnel splinter.
“What business?” lie called out in the
voice of one who greets a stranger.
Starlight favored him with a salute. “I
serve Allah and Endred. There is a matter
of two bloodhounds,” he intimated with
studied assurance.
Ishmail measured him foot and hand, an
uncertain scowl on liis Cyclopean brow.
“Where is the Commandant’s letter?” he in-
quired.
Starlight shrugged. “A fool but not a
soldier would try to pass the British lines
carrying the Commandant’s signature.”
Ishmail regarded him with sudden favor.
“You passed the British lines?”
“Allah helps his own. Where are the
dogs?”
“You are in a hurry!”
“The Commandant has given a date for
the hunt. Where are the bloodhounds?”
“They are here.”
“There is a rougher hound in this house,
not of the man-hunting breed. Endred needs
it for another purpose.”
“The Commandant’s orders were for two
bloodhounds only,” Ishmail snapped. “The
big wolf-dog stays here. Take what is thine.”
The Levantine sea-captain opened wide the
door of the dog-house.
Starlight entered the close-smelling shed
and stood opposite a bed of straw where a
couple of big-chested, fawn-colored hounds
lay watching him with glowing eyes. For
an instant the Australian experienced a sick
feeling when he recalled certain man-hunt-
ing expeditions organised by Turkish officers
in the Tigris Valley.
“The one is called Sultan, and ran to
death nine infidel soldiers at Ephesus. ’
Ishmail stooped to caress the hound’s pant-
ing sides. “This smaller one is swifter.
Imsliallah! Behold his teeth and neck
muscles. His name is Mahomet.”
Mahomet emitted a soft whine as Star-
light unfastened the two leashes from a
hook in the wall. Ishmail pressed a long-
thonged whip into his hand as they passed
from the shed. Starlight was inclined to
renew his demand for the kangaroo hound,
(Continued on next page.)


but on reflection checked himself. He was
not sure where the adventure would end,
nor how the presence of Blue Gum would
help Chanter. He was certain, however, that
the presence of Sultan and Mahomet would
pass him through the Turkish lines.
From the gate Marie watched him in
voiceless trepidation. The sight of the two
bloodhounds hauling on their leashes filled
her with dread. Noel Chanter would never
return from the hills where soldier-prisoners
were crucified. Mon Dieu, it was terrible.
And why had Captain Ishmail prevented
the Australian from taking Blue Gum?
It was almost dark. Large white stars lit
the desert’s rim. Troops of native boys and
FAIR’S FAIR.
MOTHER: “Whatever are you two children quarrelling over now?”
ELSIE: “Mummy, he wants to he godmother to the kittens, and it’s my turn!”
donkeymen paused to stare after the strid-
ing giant holding the two straining blood-
hounds in check. Starlight’s brow held the
impress of his cogitations. He could not see
the end of this soul-gripping mission into
which he had been urged by the dream-priest
in the bazaar. That his mission would take
him to the Commandant’s tent he was cer-
tain. But it would not save Chanter.
For a moment he felt like abandoning the
enterprise and returning to camp in the hope
of persuading the commanding officer to
strike a blow for Chanter’s life. It needed
no second thought to indicate the hopeless-
ness of such a request. And again the
priest’s words returned to comfort and nerve
him: “Endred is not eight thousand. He
fears death as the harlot and the pariah fear
it”
The desert hills soon shut him out from
the town. Sand dunes and cactus filled the
darkening skyline. He was hungry and
thirsty, for in the thought of Chanter’s
shortening hours he had forgotten to eat.
The dogs sniffed and mumbled at the end
of their leashes, and not without cause. The
sudden flash of a rifle halted them on the
fringe of some barbed-wire entanglements.
The head of a Turkish patrol showed on the
crest of the ridge ; and again his rifle men-
aced them.
At the words “Allah and Endred” shouted
back in clear tones by the stiff-shouldered
Starlight the rifle was lowered and the order
to pass was given,
“Way for the Commandant’s blood-
hounds !” The warning was bellowed along
the Turkish outposts as Starlight loped past
groups of Anatolian soldiers, who lined the
ridge to watch the dogs go by.
Once within the Turkish lines he found
progress easy. A fczzed officer of the guard
directed him to the Commandant’s quarters.
The lights of Endred’s tent fell on the two
panting hounds. A sentry presented arms.
A few moments later the white-coated
figure of the Commandant appeared in the
doorway. His thin, haw T k face took in the
dogs and their leader at a glance. Star-
light saluted and held to his leashes.
The Commandant made a sign. “The
hounds are thin. How do they run?” he
inquired sourly.
“Like Indian cheetahs, Excellency.”
A strain of good humor lit the Pasha’s
eyes. His trap-tight mouth smiled on the
Australian. “You are Ishmail’s servant;
you stay here until the sport is over,” he
intimated with finality.
Again Starlight saluted. “It is your
Excellency’s pleasure. You speak of sport?”
he ventured guardedly, patting Sultan’s
heaving sides. “The hounds have not been
fed. Is there much running, Excellency?”
Endred nodded gruffly in the direction
of the rear lines. “The Australians have
been troubling us. Allah put the last man
of his company into our hands, after his
third effort to destroy our outposts,” he
snarled. “For such men there is but one
end. He shall run for his life.”
“Your Excellency is the final judge,” Star-
light assured him. “How will he run,
Excellency? The condition of these hounds
is known to me. Will the run be a hard
one?”
“Within the dried watercourse across the
hills. I shall allow the Australian a start
of fifty seconds. If he can elude the dogs
and reach his own lines by way of the
Ghazim Pass, the affair will end. What are
his chances, dog-man?” he inquired with a
new interest in the slow-breathing Star-
light.
Starlight suppressed a desire to cry out,
to grip the throat of this bitter-voiced Mos-
lem. The soft intoning of the near guard
steadied him.
“The prisoner has no chance after the
first hundred yards, Excellency.” Then a
thought flashed across Starlight, leaving him
smiling but cold. To save Chanter he could
at least disable temporarily one or both of
the hounds or put them beyond dragging him
down.
Endred Pasha turned in the tent door-
way ; his voice jarred like a death sentence
on the lonely Starlight.
“Heave the dogs in the care of my ser-
vant,” he intimated. “For to-night you are
dismissed.”
Starlight saluted and blundered away in
charge of a fat Turkish corporal of the
guard to a tent which had been set apart
for him. A bottle of wine that tasted like
sweet vinegar, together with fruit and bread,
awaited him.
He ate almost wolfishly, for he knew that
a life-and-deatli scramble lay somewhere
ahead. He must eat to fight. Starving men
rarely helped a comrade in need. Then he
threw himself on the camp-bed.
He was awakened by the shrill calling of
bugles, the strange voices of company com-
manders mustering men to a grand parade.
Outside the tent Starlight saw several bat-
talions of soldiers marching towards a dry
watercourse across the hills. He had met
them before at Mudros and Anafata. Now
his gorge rose at sight of them.
Permission from the
corporal being granted
he followed the dust-
shrouded columns of
men to the banks of
a sunken stream-bed
that ran from the
Turkish lines into
British territory. The
floor of the stream-
bed was as smooth as
a pavement for the
first half-mile; then
it became choked with
boulders and sand-
drifts over which
Chanter must race be-
fore the protecting
barbed wire of the
Anzac lines was
reached.
Accompanied by sev-
eral members of his
staff, Endred Pasha
had ridden to the head
of the water-course
where the two blood-
hounds stood sniffing
the air at the end
of their leashes.
In that moment
Starlight had a vision
of Chanter’s mother standing at the sliprail
leading to the homestead. A tiny creek
showed under the lone coolabahs. Away in
the shimmering distance sheep straggled be-
side the long wire fence. Mrs. Chanter was
waiting for the post, for news of the ship
that was to bring Noel home.
The shouting voice of Endred Pasha
brought him back to life. “The dogs are
well rested.” he announced to the expectant
staff. “They were bred and fed by our good
Mussulman friends in Jaffa. Sweet to them
is the scent of an infidel’s blood. Are we
ready?”
Chanter appeared suddenly accompanied
by a squad of Anatolian soldiers. He had
the look of one who had been kept waiting
in ignorance of his sentence. A single glance
at the two bloodhounds revealed his fate, and
the muscles of his strong young body grew
taut under the silk vest he had been
allowed to retain.
fie was led into the dry watercourse where
a chalk line had been drawn. At a sign from
Endred ho was left standing on the line, his
body crouched forward for the flying start.
Not once did he look back at the two
hounds, hauling on their leashes, jaws adrip,
flanks aquiver under the imposed restraint.
Starlight stood rigid at the head of the
stream-bed, a neglected witness to a Dant-
esque drama he had helped to create. He
was watching the Commandant’s movements,
the ugly service revolver slanting from a
shut fist.
Suddenly the revolver cracked on the still,
hot air. Chanter bounded from the chalk-
mark and ran in a straight line along the
smooth track of the stream-bed.
One of the Commandant’s aides ticked off
fifty seconds with a watch, while the close-
packed lines of Turkish infantrymen shouted
from the banks for the dogs to be released.
At the word “fifty,” uttered in Arabic,
Mahomet and Sultan were slipped. For a
hundred yards they raced breast to breast
down the middle of the watercourse, and
the dullest-brained camp-followers saw at a
glance the futility of Chanter’s endeavor.
With the sound of their sobbing breaths
in his ear Chanter’s stride lengthened, and
the swart, hard-fighting Anatolians cheered
hoarsely at his effort.
It was soon evident that the two blood-
hounds differed in point of speed and train-
ing. Mahomet, the smaller one, outstripped
its companion and was gaining on the fast-
running Chanter by leaps and bounds. But
Chanter was too much in love with life to
look round or waste a pulsebeat in his fierce
efforts to maintain his lead.
And as he ran he heard through the suffo-
cating blood-noises in his head the call of
the grey-haired mother by the sliprails at
Ganderra. The hot sun struck between his
eyes as he leaped and swerved down the red
sandstone track. His straining ears caught
the guttural breathing of the two beasts at
his heels; he heard the sudden clash of jaws,
the angry whine and slithering of feet that
told of Mahomet’s first effort to bring him
down, lie bounded away to the left to avoid
the animal’s cunning side-leap at his throat.
Twenty yards of smooth track separated
him from the boulders and sand ridges at the
end of the course. He felt the hot sky swoop
down and cover him as Mahomet shortened
his stride for the second leap. Once held by
the smaller bloodhound he would soon be
in the grip of the oncoming Sultan.
A lightning glance at the ground in front
showed him that the end had come. In-
stinctively he flung back his head to inhale
a last deep breath of air.
In that moment his foot touched a pebble-
hole in the hard sandstone floor, and the
contact almost flung him to his knees. In
the delirious effort to recover himself he was
conscious of a monster kangaroo-hound rush-
ing out from the cover of some desert scrub
on the left bank of the watercourse.
Only the nearest Anatolian infantryman
saw what happened. The kangaroo-hound
raced between the staggering Chanter and
the fleet-footed Mahomet. There was a
momentary impact of shoulders, a short, fierce
scuffle in which Mahomet’s knee was broken
between the monster hound’s crunching jaws.
Chanter ran with the sound of Mahomet’s
yells in his ears. He turned for a moment
to watch Sultan spring past its maimed com-
panion and continue the chase. Although
slow of foot the bigger bloodhound was not
to be tempted from its quarry. It swerved
from contact with the kangaroo-liound and
charged on the young lieutenant’s heels.
Chanter became dizzily aware of the kan-
garoo-hound running at his side, its long,
wet muzzle upthrust to lick his hot, clenched
hand. The contact steadied him for an in-
stant, the next revealed the hopelessness of
his position. Endred had passed the order
to shoot Chanter, since the race had been
interfered with by a foreign pariah dog.
A score of bullets buzzed down the water-
course from the rifles of pursuing Anatolians.
Chanter stumbled and caught his breath
fiercely; a thin trickle of blood showed on
DEPENDS ON WHEN YOU LOOK.
“Winners hard to find at Randwick yesterday?”
“Oh, no—not after the race!”
his hip. Sultan clung to his shadow, goaded
by the mad cries of the Turks.
“Pull, pull the accursed infidel down!
Pull and hold T ”
Chanter fought wildly against the deadly
vertigo of exhaustion, the blinding heat that
drenched his eyes with sweat. He stag-
gerech recovered his stride for a moment,
and again experienced the cool, wet muzzle
of the kangaroo-liound as he pitched to his
j. necg
With Sultan on his heels he cast himself
down a slight declivity in his last effort to
escape Sultan’s rending jaws. His head and
shoulders struck boulders in his descent. But
through his pain-blinded eyes he saw that
the kangaroo-dog had stayed in the track to
challenge the tiger-like rush of the blood-
hound.
For a little while Chanter lay still as a
sick child on the sandy floor. Through his
smarting eyes he watched the furious strug-
gles of the two masterful animals above.
The kangaroo-dog, by its sheer weight and
gripping power, almost flung the torn and
bleeding Sultan across him.
Chanter crawled to his feet, and with a
last glance at the battling dogs made for the
end of the watercourse.
The shots from the Turkish riflemen
ceased. Over the edge of a cactus-covered
drift poured a detachment of Australian
mounted infantry, firing into the brown of
the Moslem horde as they advanced and de-
ployed. The right wing of the detachment
wheeled and encircled the reeling Chanter.
Hobbling forward, his head fell against the
saddle of the officer in command.
“There are two dogs scrapping in the gully,
Payne,” he gasped, clinging to the saddle.
“One’s a bloodhound —shoot it if you like.
But spare the other; it’s an Aussie!”
Bate that night Starlight limped past the
challenging Anzac sentries, outside the lines,
and found his way to the hospital in the
rear. Inside a spacious, fan-cooled tent he
saw Chanter sitting up in bed, an ice-filled
glass of lemonade on the table beside him.
Chanter turned quickly as Starlight
entered, a puzzled frown on his brow.
“Come in, Starlight,” lie invited. "In re-
turn for a few things I’ve done for you,
you present Endred with a pair of hellhounds
to chase me off the earth. Please sit down
and do some explaining, old son.”
Starlight cast himself wearily into a camp
chair and slowly drank the iced lemonade
offered him. It was some time before he
spoke. He had walked far and eluded the
enemy patrols by the skin of his teeth.
“It’s this way. I’d an idea that the two
hounds I brought from Ishmail might be
useful to scare away the jackals if Endred
decided to let ’em eat you up,” he confided
ruefully. “I didn’t quite know Endred’s
game. So I decided to get close in and try
to use the hounds when the jackals started
to bite you.”
Chanter suppressed liis laughter. “But
who in thunder sent old Blue Gum along - .'"
he demanded.
“A young lady named Marie. She used
to brighten up sick Diggers in the hospital
at Suez,” Starlight responded, watching the
danger signals in Chanter’s cheeks.
The young lieutenant stared thoughtfully
into the flame of a slow-burning lamp, a
tender gleam in his troubled eyes.
“Funny Endred didn’t turn on you,” he
said, as though to hide his confusion. “You
seem to have got away without trouble.”
Starlight consulted his wrist watch pen-
sively. It was nearly ten o’clock.
“Well,” he said, “I complained that I had
lost two valuable hounds, and jagged Endred
into paying me for them. It was the only
bluff I could put up. I got the money, fifty
Turkish pounds in all, and was allowed to
stroll round.”
Outside the tent a hairy shape rose from
the sands. A wet, inquiring muzzle was
thrust into Starlight’s hand. He suppressed
an exclamation as ho patted the kangaroo-
dog’s head.
“Some women and dogs make the running
easy for some fellows, Blue Gum,” he com-
mented, with a backward glance at Chanter
inside the hospital tent.
Chanter heard, laughed quietly. “I’ll be
running another race shortly, you old bush-
ranger. Wish me luck.”
“She won’t be hard for you to catch.” the
big man predicted as he strode away to his
own quarters.

DULGIE DEAMER.
The Forgotten Factor.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
DURING his five years in Fremantle
gaol Cooney had plenty of time to medi-
tate on the technique of crime. The
conclusions he arrived at were, firstly, that
a man should always work alone ; secondly,
that a good get-away should always. be
arranged; thirdly, that an easily accessible
but secure hiding-place should always be pre-
pared for the plunder. Given these three
factors, there was no reason why success
should not always follow. There was another
conclusion which he arrived at, but which
for the moment he pushed into the back-
ground of his mind—that, given the prospect
of a good haul, a man should not hesitate
over a little judicious murder.
Cooney arrived at these conclusions calmly
in the seclusion of his cell. He was there
doing a seven-years’ stretch because of tin;
weakness of his last mate, who squealed
when the demons squeezed him. No more
mates after that! Yet, because Cooney sat
so quiet and meditative in his cell, the Prison
Board decided that he was reforming and
let him out on a “short five.”
The board was foolish ; Cooney thought it
incredible. Nevertheless he kept a straight
faoe while the chairman lectured him; then
he promised to be good and received the chap-
lain’s blessing and the few pounds due to
him. After which, as soon as the gates
closed behind him, he made for the goldfields,
where there was a good thing lie had been
turning over all the time he had been in
prison.
N,ow he was stretched flat on the summit
of a bare hill watching the lights of Consi-
dine’s mill in the valley below. The plant
was not working; at least, the stamps were
not dropping in the battery-house. Cooney
knew, though, that important work was
being done—that Considine, with a couple
of trusted hands, was busy cleaning up the
week’s gold.
He had watched the whole process before,
and now could read by the movement of the
lights just what was going on. He had spent
hours there—had watched Considine and his
men carry the amalgam from the battery-
house to the smelting-room, where he knew
by the black smoke pouring from the chim-
ney that the crucible furnace was ready. In
his mind’s eye he had seen them lift the
white-hot crucible from the flames and pour
the liquid gold into the ingot moulds. After
an interval sufficient for the gold to cool and
solidify, he had seen a light travel across to
the little corrugated-iron camp where Con-
sidine usually slept and where he kept the
strong safe in which he stored his gold. All
these things Cooney either saw or knew from
intensive study.
Presently the lights in the battery-house
which had been left burning clicked out.
Then followed those in the smelting-room,
leaving only the single light in the room
where Considine slept.
But Cooney did not move. Tensely he
listened. Along the foot of the hill came
sounds of plodding feet and a few words of
dull conversation. Considine’s helpers, weary
with much overtime, were going home. Slowly
they trudged along until the sounds of their
going were lost in the distance.
Cooney breathed a little easier. That was
good; they were both going. He had half-
feared that Considine would keep one of
them to help him guard the gold.
Aft or the workers had passed the stillness
settled down again, and Coonoy, with eyes
glued on the solitary light below, waited
patiently.
Midnight came with a roar of whistles
from the big mines half a mile or more away.
Thon the light in the window snapped out.
“At last!”
But he did not move. Too much of the
world was still awake. A train went roar-
ing past in the near distance. Long after-
wards, it seemed, stealing faintly over the
silent air came the far-off boom of the Ival-
goorlie town clock. “One !’’
Too soon yet.
An eternity passed. Cooney's body was
stiff from inaction, and his teeth had begun
to chatter a little when over the air again
came the boom of the clock: “One, Two!”
Time ! Cooney rose and stretched himself.
Then he began cautiously to slink down the
hill. At the foot and before starting across
the fiat he halted long enough to draw a
couple of pairs of thick woollen socks over
liis canvas shoes. No tell-tale footprints
this time; he had it all worked out to a
science.
On the other side of the flat he found the
mill dam. Here a mud wall five or six feet
high gave him shelter, and he halted awhile
to listen for any sound of movement.
All was well. Almost on tiptoe he crept
along in the shadow of the wall. He had
his revolver ready—there might be a dog
somewhere, and he might have to shoot the
brute and run. But nothing came, and with
due caution he reached the end of the wall,
which brought him to within twenty feet of
the gold-room. Scarcely daring to breathe,
he hurried across and halted at the door.
Listening with his cheek close to the wood, he
could hear the measured breathing of the
sleeper within.
Good again! Now for' the lock! It was
a patent night-latch, guaranteed burglar-
proof, but he did not mind that. In gaol lie
had worked for a time in the machine shop,
where he had found a tutor in an expert
locksmith-burglar. Besides, he had examined
the lock a week ago whilst pretending to
A PRETTY COMMON COMPLAINT, TOO.
“What did the doctor say was wrong with Muriel’s hubby, Auntie?”
“He calls it syncopation!”
“Oh, yes, I know—a slow movement from bar to bar.”
look for work, and now had half a dozen
approximate skeleton keys ready. Selecting
one, he tried it. It fitted well enough, but
failed to lift all the tumblers. A second did
no better, but the third was right. With-
out even a click the latch slipped back and
the door commenced to open. But not far;
an inch—no farther. With a curse he
realised that it was held by a bar!
For a moment his resolution was shaken
and he was half-inclined to turn away. But
the thought of the gold within and how
much he needed it held him to the job. He
was desperately hard up, having sunk all
the cash he possessed in the revolver and
other items of his outfit. There could be no
turning back. Failure held no other prospect
than hunting for a job, which might not be
easily found. And he hated work and dis-
cipline—he got too much of both in gaol.
Bracing himself, he crent around to the
window. It was open. The night was hot
and, despite the possibility of thieves. Con-
sidine had felt the necessity of fresh air.
But entrance was not to be found there so
easily. The window was small, rather diffi-
cult to crawl through, while just below the
sill was a table piled high with prospecting-
pans and assay-dishes, needing but a touch
to send them all clattering to' the floor. A
momentary flash of his torch revealed this.
It also revealed the head of the sleeper—a
tempting target for a bullet. There was no
help for it; the gold was either his or Con-
sidine’s; so, raising the revolver, Cooney
aimed at where he knew the head to be. A
flash, and the bullet _ sped home, crashing
through skull and continuing the tired man’s
sleep for ever.
The snap rang out on the still night like
the report of a cannon. To Cooney it seemed
that it must be heard miles away. The idea
filled him with terror, and, stooping low, he
ran back to the shelter of the embankment.
Here he crouched, listening for the sound of
approaching footsteps. But no one came;
and the tumultuous beating of his heart
calmed down and the hair on his scalp ceased
to bristle.
He wondered how Considine was getting
on. Had the shot settled him, or was lie still
alive and perhaps waiting, gun in hand, to
get his would-be murderer? There was a
risk of that; naturally he hadn’t waited to
see the effect of the bullet.
However, he would soon see. Creeping to
the door again he put liis ear to the wood.
There was no sound of breathing this time ;
only a drip. .. .drip... .drip, which could
mean only one thing. Going to the window,
he flashed his torch again. Everything was
right.
Lifting himself up on the sill Cooney
started to wriggle in. It was rather a diffi-
cult job, the window opening being small
and the pile of tin dishes in the way. He
tried to avoid upsetting them, but sAnt the
lot crashing to the floor. The din sounded
terrific —enough almost to wake the dead
man. Cooney’s blood turned to water with
fright—surely someone must have heard
that! Standing in the dark room he strained
his ears again. Then reason came to bis aid:
if the penetrating sound of the shot had
passed unheard, the clatter of a few tin
dishes, loud though it seemed, would attract
no notice.
It was some time nevertheless before he
dared to move again. It was a terrible
thing this working without a mate; it had
seemed easy to contemplate, but the reality
was terrifying. Still, there was no turning
back now; he had made himself eligible for
the rope, so he might as well finish the job.
Clenching his teeth to stop their chatter, he
nerved himself to go on.
The first thing was the window. There
was a blind of sorts, and, after closing the
sash, he pulled it down. That would stop
the light . showing outside. Then with a
flash of his torch he found the switch and
flooded the room with light.
The dead man—was he really dead? The
eyes were open ; but no slightest movement
came from him. The keys would be under
liis pillow. Dragging it away he brought
them to light.
The safe was easily opened and the gold
w r as his. There was more than he expected;
more, he thought, than he could carry. Still,
he could try. A good-sized handbag stood
on top of the safe, and, taking it, he piled
in the golden ingots. Gold! To get so much
was worth a murder!
He must be quick; this was no time to
linger. But before he went he must wipe out
all fingerprints. Taking his handkerchief, he
rubbed it over every spot where his hands
might have rested. Then, lifting the bar
from the door, he switched off the light and
stepped outside.
He had the revolver ready, but no one was
there. The silence was deathlike; only, from
afar off, like the surge of the sea, came the
faint roar of the mills of the Golden Mile.
The first part was over.
With his revolver in one hand and the
bag in the other he started across the flat.
He was horribly nervy now. Every dark
shadow seemed to hold a man. But nothing
happened, and after a few hundred yards
he felt calm again. Coming to the fence
which bordered the railway line, he followed
it for about half a mile until he reached a
level crossing guarded by cattle pits. Here
he paused to place the bag on the rails
which gridironed the top of a pit. Then he
struck off along the line, using a path worn
dusty by the travel of fettlers. The black-
trackers would be able to follow him easily
along this. He intended them to.
Not far from the first level crossing was
a second which connected with a much-
travelled road. Leaving the line he stepped
out on to this road as if making for the
town. After about twenty paces he stopped,
and, balancing on one foot, pulled off the
thick socks which muttled the other shoe.
Then, side-stepping as far as possible, he
repeated the manoeuvre, and stood now in
heeled canvas shoes. Next, he walked back-
wards slowly and carefully until he reached
the railway fence. Without turning he again
balanced on one foot while he removed the
shoe and sock from the other foot. Then,
reaching back with his bare foot, he got
on the fence and lifted himself up. Re-
moving the second shoe, he shoved the pair
into his pockets and made his way along
the fence, across the cattle pits, back to the
line again. Then, walking on the shining
metal, he started back to where he had left
the bag of gold.
It was rather a tricky job, this balancing
on the rail; but being in his bare feet and
having the exposed ends of the wooden
sleepers to rest a foot on when lie tired, he
managed all right. He had done it before—
often. One never knew !
The bag was still there, as he expected;
the place was too utterly solitary for any-
one to have passed at that hour of night.
Reaching down into the cattle pit he found
a pair of boots which he Jiiad planted the
previous day. Slipping these on he picked
up the gold, walked a few stejis along the
rail, then stepped off on to the road. He had
made his getaway, covered his tracks so that
no black-tracker, however clever, could
follow them.
Now for the hiding-place.
About a quarter of a mile from
the crossing was a low hill into
which a cavern had been burrowed
by fossickers. Around this hill were
scores of abandoned shafts, some
deep, others not so deep, some
shallow. Radiating from the
back of the cavern were half
a dozen tunnels which by devi-
ous turnings connected with most
of the abandoned shafts. The place
had been rooted and tunnelled by
an army of diggers following runs
of wash-dirt or stray quartz lead-
ers. Down one of these shafts
Cooney designed to plant his gold.
He had one in particular marked
for the purpose. It was about fifty
feet deep, which meant that the
bottom would be in darkness even
at midday; it was also accessible,
but not easily, by a tunnel connect-
ing with the cavern.
Reaching his chosen shaft was
rather risky work in the darkness,
but by a judicious use of his torch
he managed to avoid the hundred
traps and pitfalls which hedged the
way. Placing the revolver in the
bag with the gold he dropped the
lot down the ink-black pit, hearing
with satisfaction the heavy thud on
the bottom. The woollen socks and
the canvas shoes followed. Then
weary but buoyed with the know-
ledge that he had carried out the
crime with the utmost perfection
of technique Cooney went home—
home being a tattered canvas
humpy abandoned by its previous
owner. Into this he crawled and
fell asleep, the hour still lacking a
few minutes of sunrise.
'l'lie murder was discovered on
Monday morning when the battery
hands turned up to work. The
police and a tracker were scon on
the scene, and without delay the
blaekfellow cast around for foot-
prints. lie had no trouble in finding
them, and soon was able to recon-
struct the movements of the mur-
derer. Then came the following of
the tracks and the running of the
quarry to earth.
The thing looked easy—too easy,
one experienced detective thought
as lie followed the muffled foot-
prints. He was right. The trail
lay like an open book as far as
the second crossing. Then it
faulted. Time after time the tracker east
around in an ever-widening circle, but not a
trace of the muffled footprints could be else-
where found. True, they found the marks
of the canvas shoes, and fancied them sus-
picious, but these footprints obviously came
from the fence and started down the dusty
road.
Back to the mill went the trackers, and
from there they traced the muffled footprints
to the hill where the murderer had waited
and watched. Here they found marks of
canvas shoes, and the tracks were the same
as those at the crossing. With the scent
warm again, they ran it down like blood-
hounds.
The shoe-prints thus became the clue, and
plaster casts were taken of the most dis-
tinct. But the detectives could not picture
a man walking barefoot along the rails
back to the other crossing; so, abandoning
tracking for a time, they started out to find
the owner of the canvas shoes. Lucky for
Cooney that he had dropped them down the
shaft! He was one of the first that the
detectives visited. His recent discharge from
gaol made inquiry inevitable; also the rob-
bery, if not the murder, was along his line
of previous work. But he bluffed them off
easily enough. He had nothing but poverty
to show them. They harshly advised him to
get work. Then they passed to the next on
their list.
For a full month the detectives searched
and harried without result. Daily Cooney
read of their failure, and it pleased him
highly. The vision of a ceremony in which
he and a rope took parts began to fade, and
in its place came the pride and elation of the
superior craftsman. His meditations had
borne fruit; his technique was perfect. But
he was not altogether easy about the gold;
and often at night, thinking about it, he
worked himself almost to a frenzy over the
possibility of someone discovering it. There
was always that chance. Some old digger
might take a fancy to try these old shafts
again. Someone might crawl in from the


big cavern. Boys perhaps—he had often seen
them playing around the place. He argued
to himself that discovery was so unlikely
as to be practically impossible; yet each
day seemed to make the peril greater until,
the full month having passed, he felt that
he could endure it no longer—he must go
and retrieve the gold.
He made arrangements for its sale. That
was easily done; he had the choice of a dozen
illicit gold-buyers, men as discreet as the
grave, who were willing to buy up to ten
thousand ounces and no questions asked. He
chose late afternoon as the most suitable
time for his venture —that would give him
enough daylight to locate the bottom of his
shaft and bring the gold back to the cavern,
after which he could carry it to the gold-
buyer’s under the cover of darkness. Per-
haps it would be safer to do the whole thing
at night. But he was scarcely a good enough
miner for that; he had to rely on daylight
to help him in locating the various shafts
as he crawled through the tunnels.
Taking a prospecting-dish and a shovel
he started out. But there was really no need
for camouflage or caution ; not a soul was in
sight, not even a derelict dryblower.
The way into the cavern was easy; there
was a wide cart-track leading down to it.
At the far end were the tunnels. Choosing
the one which led to his shaft, he started
along its uninviting darkness, leaving his
dish and shovel outside.
For some twenty feet he walked comfort-
ably enough; then the tunnel took a sharp
turn, and the roof dropped lower. The turn
and the drooping roof shut out all light;
but he lit the torch and pushed on.
Crawling through abandoned tunnels is
hair-bristling work. On alluvial diggings
they are never high or spacious; the digger
gives himself bare picking and shovelling
room. Added to this he leaves behind heaps
of dirt piled almost to the roof, with a bare
passage-way at the top. In other places the
roof itself falls and makes a block. These
obstacles are bad enough when the tunnel
is being worked ; after it has been abandoned
for years they become terror-inspiring; the
explorer experiences a dread that some hang-
ing earth will fall behind him, trapping him
in a lingering death. Added to this elemen-
tal fear are. the death-like silence, the foul,
sluggish air and the enveloping darkness.
He needs to be a bold man who will ven-
ture through such tunnels alone.
Cooney felt the animal’s primitive dread
of the trap; but, keeping always the reward
in sight, lie forced himself on: In some
places he could stand upright and walk; in
others he crawled, sometimes even wriggled;
now! he struggled up a rill, then half-rolled
down the other side. But nothing could
daunt him: he had killed a man to get this
gold, and now he must retrieve it.
At last the shaft showed a patch of twi-
light just ahead. Here was the narrowest
burrow of all, the dirt piled high—-the
diggers had intended to hoist it to the
surface.
Peering through he could see the outline
of the handbag in the semi-darkness. The
sight raised his spirits. Lying flat he
wriggled forward until his head and shoul-
ders . projected into the shaft. His hand
closed on the bag. A wave of exultation
swept over him. At last it was his; his
poverty was ended ; he would be rich now!
Suddenly something moved; at the same
instant there was a sharp hiss and a quick
CONFIDENCES.
“I love you, darling, because you’re the most beautiful little girl in all the world.”
“And I love you, dear, because you’re not like other boys — you’re so frank and truthful.”
pain darted through Cooney’s wrist. Then
coils began to thrash around his arm.
Frantically he shook his hand as he tried
to draw back. But the snake was not to be
denied. It had been disturbed and was
angry. Again it struck, this time on his
face. In a frenzy of terror he seized it with
his hands and dragged it away; heedless of
its vicious fangs, he battered the hideous
black head against the bag, against the dirt.
anywhere, so long as he bruised and broke it.
Then lie started to go back. The gold
was forgotten, or, if thought of, left un-
heeded. What did he want with gold! Death
beckoned, and he clamored for life. Life
was all he needed now.
How he got out he never knew. Cuts and
bruises were as nothing; he must get to
someone for help, to a doctor before the
deadly venom chilled his blood and paralysed
his limbs. Somehow he groped and stumbled
through the tunnel to the big vaulted cavern.
Then up the incline he rushed to the open
air. A few minutes later a motor-truck
driver found a frantic, breathless man at the
railway crossing. “The hospital, for God’s
sake—l’ve been bitten by a snake!” was all
the man could gasp.
* * * *
Late that night a Miner reporter stepped
into the local C.I.D. office.
“Anything fresh?” he inquired hopefully.
“Nothing doing.”
The reporter dropped into a chair. “Stiff
luck!” he said. “Nothing ever is doing these
days. If it hadn’t been for a snake yarn
we might as well have
told ’em to take to-mor-
row’s paper as read....
Not heard of it? Chap
up at the hospital bitten
on the face and wrist.
Crawling around in an
old tunnel that a black
snake said it had a better
right to. Chap called
Cooney—know him?”
The senior detective
pricked up his ears.
“Cooney!” he repeated.
“What sort of man was
he?”
The reporter was rather
good at descriptions.
“Now what was he do-
ing crawling around tun-
nels?” was the detective’s
unspoken question as he
placed his man. “Any
idea where. this tunnel
was?” he queried.
“Somewhere over Hannan’s Flat,” the re-
porter hazarded. “Anyway, a motor-truck
picked him up at the crossing there and
brought him in.”
After the reporter had gone the detective
walked across to the hospital to make sure.
Anything concerning a person on his list
interested him.
“Think you’ll save him, Doctor?” he asked.
“I think we will. The bite on the wrist
was the most dangerous —he got that first,
it seems, and naturally it received most of
the venom. Still, as the strike was on an
extremity, wc were able to ligature and lance,
so I think it’ll be all right.”
Returning to the office the detective gave
a short order to his junior. “Have Darby
out at daybreak—we’ve got some work to
do.”
The junior looked at him inquiringly.
“Cooney,” the sergeant, explained. “I’m
wondering what he was doing crawling about
an old tunnel over that way. We’ll get the
tracker to run liis footprints back, and then
we’ll see what he was after.”
Casting around from the crossing, the
tracker found no trouble in picking up
Cooney’s prints of the day before. They
were the footmarks of a man running, deep
impressions showing the toe only and widely
spaced. Back over the gravelly flat they
were traced, down into the cavern. The
shovel and dish were where Cooney had left
them, and they sufficiently indicated the tun-
nel. With electric torch and candle-light the
detectives and the tracker continued to trace
their man’s devious passage. It was slow
going, since they were big men, and they
found many a tight squeeze. But at length
they came to a hole through which the leader
could glimpse a big handbag, a pair of shoes
and, not so distinctly, a dead snake,
* f . * ' ~ , . ,
Cooney was lying m a hospital bed watcn-
ing a little nurse who attended anxiously
to his wants. He was beginning to have
notions about this little nurse. When lie
got his gold out of that shaft he might find
it worth while to stroll around and see her.
His meditations were interrupted by the
entrance of two large, severe-looking men.
One of them he noted, with a shudder, car-
ried a handbag that he had seen before. The
other had something—a pair of shoes, appa-
rentlv wrapped in paper.

Phegan’s Ride.
[FOR THE BULLETIN. ]
DANIEL PHEGAN, teacher of a little
bush school in a sprawling slab barn
on George Cobb’s farm, had been look-
ing for eggs in, the long grass when he disap-
peared. A little while afterwards some of
the boys, while playing hidings, were attrac-
ted by strange sounds to an old well, which
was dry and half-hidden. It was about 12ft.
deep and Bft. in diameter. The. decayed cover-
ing was freshly broken, and below it they
discovered Phegan.
But never could they have imagined the
predicament he was in. For a moment they
just stood and stared. At the-bottom was a
brindie cow, and clinging desperately on her
back, and riding the ride of his life, was
Daniel Phegan.
Being customarily a sober-minded gentle-
man, of a rather stiff demeanor, he cut a
more ludicrous figure than George Cobb, the
farmer, or, Slim Jim, the timber-getter, would
have done. lie was muddied, perspiring,
short-winded and desperate. Brindle was
furious, and at every twist and turn she
made he was canted to one side or the other,
which made him grip frantically with hands
and heels and breathe hard. To most of the
onlookers he was a circus.
He had discovered Brindle through notic-
ing the broken decking, and while clearing
away some of the wreckage he had slipped
and fallen in. .
Brindle, who was always an aggressive
beast, was already in a savage mood, having
been pent up there since some time in the
night. She charged with the spirit of a
tortured avenger, and at once tossed Phegan
nearly out of the well again. He fell on her
back, and by a masterly effort managed to
stop’ there. Thereupon she bellowed ami
plunged and tore round and round, and
shook her head and snorted, whilst Phegan
slipped and slided, and several times nearly
lost his balance. He added his bellow to the
cow’s, with a faint hope that the combination
would be heard. , ■ ,
The thrilling gyrations had momentarily
steadied when the boys ran up. Seeing them
crowding above her, Brindle became more
frightened and truculent than ever. Slewing
sharply, she stuck her horns into the side of
the well and tossed a shower of eaith o\er
the luckless rider , „ .
“Get a rope. lie yelied, trying frantically
with lialf-blinded eyes to follow the enatic
movements of the beast. . , ,
The boys, forming a ring °« 'l Ja®
in their eagerness to see what was going on,
and expecting a catastrophe every mmu^
broke more earth ivitli then restless tee..
Phegan had by this time lost his hat and
some of the earth went down the back of his
neck and wetted wit . perspiration, torn,,
an uncomfortable dollar of mud. At the
same time Brindle, incensed at the clods
dropping, on her, shook her head and swung
viciously from side to side.
“Get away from there, all of you! Stand
back!” roared Phegan.
.The noise startled Brindle. She jumped
and reared at the side of the well, and Phegan
slided to the butt of her tail. Then she ran
backwards and dropped on her knees, and
Phegan shot forward again till bis foot struck
against her horn. In a frenzy she sprang up
and tossed her head, and the busy rider nar-
rowly escaped throwing a back somersault.
“Get a rope!” he roared again. “By the
hokey, if I was up there I’d stir some of
you!” ■ .
To him it seemed that Brindle was the only
one that was making any response to his
calls. Her conduct exasperated him, but he
dared not dig his heels into her. He sought
instead to pacify her. “Whey, wdioa there!”
he said, soothingly. “Bail up, old girl!”
That failing to improve matters, he cast a
rapid glance aloft, and cried again to the
mob to get a move on.
He was very tired ; his arms and legs
ached, and he was chafed and sore from the
animal’s ridgy back. All the while a dread
possessed him of being gored and trampled
to death if he lost his seat. The ■ tormented
cow was savage enough to eat him.
One of the. boys went down the plantation
to fetch George Cobb and his aboriginal farm-
hand, Paddy Midnight; and shortly after-
wards Curly Spencer came along with a
breaking-in rope. He made a loop at one
end, and was holding it in both hands ready
for throwing.
There was a murmur of excitement among
the crowd, and some, pressing forward again,
were in imminent danger of slipping or being
shoved into the well.
“Stand clear till I lasso him,”, said Curly,
importantly.
After some unnecessary manoeuvring and
re-adjusting of the rope, Curly lobbed it into
the well—and lassoed Brindle . round the
horns.
“You fumbling ass!” roared Phegan. “Do
you think I want the cow out first?”
Curly’s attack stirred Brindle into renewed
efforts to throw Phegan; and as she wheeled
and plunged, the rope twisted round
Phegan’s body. Every movement now
'elicited yells and execrations, whilst con-
sternation seized the spectators, as it seemed
that he must be dragged off or inextricably
tied to the cow.
Accusing looks were directed at Curly, who
stood staring at his handiwork, too abashed
to do. anything else. Then Billy Flynn seized
the rope, and with a few deft swings dis-
entangled Phegan, who was now panting and
very red.
Just then George Cobb and Paddy Mid-
night arrived; and the first thing they did
was to laugh aloud at the poor man’s pre-
dicament.
“Bless my soul, Phegan, what are you doin’
now?” Mr. Cobh exclaimed.
“Breaking your infernal cow in to saddle,”
said Phegan, sarcastically.
Paddy Midnight, with tears glistening in
his eyes, made a loop .on the other end of the
rope, and quietly dropped it over Phegan’s
shoulders. Then half a dozen took hold of
the rope and started to haul up.
They had hoisted him about v three feet
when ' a protruding rbot caught under his
belt and broke it.
“Steady! Steady now ! Whey!” shrieked
Phegan as the root tore down through his
clothes and threatened to half-strip him.
To release Phegan, the rescuers lowered
him; and as soon as he was within reach
the cow tossed her horns at his dangling feet.
With her head held high and a mad light in
her eyes, she backed and rushed and snorted
in vicious efforts to get at him. Phegan,
doubling his legs up. freed himself with his
hands, and then half-scrambled up the side
of the well as the men and boys hauled on
the rope.
For a moment he lay panting on th e
ground. Then lie glared at his pupils, “(let
to school, all of vou!” he bellowed.
And the mob stampeded._

The Song of the Wheat.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
I AM a song that the brown earth sings to
the ear of her lover the Sun ;
I am a pattern of gold and of green, that
the need of man hath spun
In the sweat of his brow, with the threads
of the wind and the jewelled drops ot
the rain,
To spread like a tapestry unfurled across
the rolling plain;
I am a wreath that the gods have twined
for the crowning of the world ;
I am a power that is stronger than steel,
with my might in a green leal: curled ;
And I am an urn that is filled with life, for
my yellow, slim grains hold
The breath of man and the strength of liis
limbs and the gain that is more than
gold.
Oh, I am the grain of the young new lands
where the lone, long plains.roll far;
I am a cry to the pioneer when he seeks a
fairer star.
Out where the virgin fields lie hid, and the
skv has a farther rim,
I lure his hopes with my promised gold till
I capture the heart of him,
And he gives me liis life and the toil of his
hands and the cunning strength of his
brain,
While the measure of his hopes and fears is
held in my ripening grain.
Maker of peace and of strife am I, for War
with his wasting flail
Strides out to the tune of man’s hunger-cry
and the splendid visions fail,
And tiie dreams and the hopes that are born
of peace are drowned in the clash of
steel;
For I am Bread, and Bread is king of men’s
passions for woe or for weal.
But whenever the long years flow with grain
and man has not care for bread,
He lists again to the song of his soul, and
mine are the white hopes sped
For the peace of the earth, for the righteous
law, for the surcease of ill and pain.
But I am Bread, and I am King, and I
laugh in each narrow grain.
Over the face of your rolling hills, over your
plains afar
I have strung you a necklace of gold to wear
whose fame is like a star
Shining at every port of the world, known
to each city and sea,
Blazed in the marts of all countries that are,
sole need of the bond and the free.
Oh, I am the grass that has conquered man.
I am the King that is Bread!
Your armies and fleets are but fragile things
that await a nod of my head.
I am a song that the need of man has sung
from the soil at his feet;
Food-giver, keeper and saviour of life, I
am the grain that is wheat.

The Glory of France.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
THAT subtle fragrance of the garden
came to meet you as you trod the road,
a change from the hard scent of gum and
wild honeysuckle that lay heavily on the
bush surroundings; and, as I reached the
fence and saw its riot of roses and garden
blooms, the beauty of it held me.
“Hey, Corp! Merci!” The hail came sud-
denly, followed by a sound of hurrying feet
as a man dashed up the path. The next
moment my hand was being shaken vigor-
ously by one whose face was familiar enough,
though my memory refused to name him;
and I found myself drawn upon the ver-
andah and seated there.
I was remembering now. It seemed that
I was back again in a smoke-filled estarni-
net in France, crowded with Diggers who
had just come into camp near by. Marie,
with others, was flitting about fulfilling the
orders for drinks, pausing to exchange
laughing badinage with some of the men.
Rumors of a French success had come
through, and though the stories had proved
to be wholly false, there was elation in
the atmosphere.
Then suddenly, at someone’s suggestion,
Marie was on a table, head in the air, sing-
ing with defiant spirit the Marseillaise. A
moment, and her voice alone was heard,
vibrant with patriotic fervor; with the light
of the oil-lamps flickering on her vaguely
and the cigarette-smoke curling around her,
she seemed like the very spirit of France.
Soon the Diggers commenced to roar or to
shout their cheers in the most familiar pas-
sages, and the song finished with a pande-
monium of applause mingling with the grat-
ing of chairs and clinking of upraised
glasses. The spirit of this movement caught
the girl; and as if herself holding aloft a
glass she cried, “The Glory of France!”
“The glory of France —you are!” Sergeant
Royle exclaimed, standing below her at the
head of the table, with his laughing eyes
on her face. She laughed down at him in
return; then he held his arms to help her,
and as she leapt he caught her in a tight
embrace. He would have kissed her, but
with reddened face she pushed herself free.
A light blow fell on his cheek.
“I am sorry, Ma’moiselle,” he said; “I
apologise.' Compree apologise?”
“Oui, you are ver’ sorrie. So am I, M’sieur
the Sergeant. That blow was for Pierre, my
betroth’.”
“He’s a lucky chap,” said the sergeant.
“He is a soldier of France,” she said
proudly. And then, as if afraid of giving-
offence : “Pardon! You, too, are a soldier—
for France. He is your comrade, is he
not?”
A chorus approved the sentiment, which
established Marie’s position with us. “She
put it neat, that sliiela,” Old Dan whispered
to me. “It isn’t playing the game to try to
take a cobber down for his girl.”
Marie again was laughing about the place,
carrying her bottles and biscuits; and Jim
Royle, always trying to catch her eye and
exchange a word with her, was noisily merry
with those around him.
There was a diversion when Clay, the
postal orderly, came in, and a rush to him
directly he spoke.
“A bit of a mail just come up, and I
thought you fellows might like to git your
letters.” A good fellow Clay. “Private
Horley here?” lie asked.
Somewhat shakily a youngish Digger rose
at the table next to mine.
“A letter?” lie asked.
“No ; there’s a message come through for
you up at the orderly-room.”
“About the wife?”
“You’d better come up.”
“It’s about the wife —I’m expecting it. Is
she dead? Is she dead, man —is she dead?”
“You’re to be given a week off duty if you
want it,” Clay said awkwardly.
Horley rose, staggering towards the door.
There he paused, came heavily back and
slumped into his chair.
“Bear up, Tete,” said Daniels, putting an
arm over his shoulder.
“I was expecting it,” said Horley
brokenly. “Curse the damned office-hounds
in Australia! They reported me killed ; and
she went down. Been ill ever since. We’d
been fond of each other since we were kids.
Then I enlisted, and all of a sudden we
decided to get married. Only a day that
was before.l left—and when Igo back she
won’t be there.”
THE PHILANTHROPIST.
MOTHER (to kid sliding down banisters ): “What are
you doing there, Cyril?”
CYRIL: “Making trousers for poor orphan boys,
Mummy.”
The note of tragedy had subdued the riot.
Not to intrude on his grief, the groups had
turned again to their own affairs. A few
men, deciding to leave, gripped his hand
silently as they passed out. And Marie,
coming to him, softly, unasked, stooped with
a quick impulse, one hand over his shoulder,
and kissed his cheek.
Jim Royle sprang up on seeing that, but
sat down again.
Afterwards Boyle's infatuation for Marie
became a camp jest. The alert, good-looking
youngster had earned a reputation for
efficiency outside the war matters that had
earned him his stripes; the amorous adven-
tures attributed to him had certainly not left
any impress upon him.
Possibly because the shadow of death was
hanging over us more definitely than usual,
it was a time when jests, however cheap,
were welcome. We were stunt-practising
instead of doing ordinary drill work, prepar-
ing for tactical operations which might mean
the end of most of us. The sheep were
being made ready for the shambles, which
were to be faced in possibly a day’s time,
possibly a week’s, but soon.
Apart from that, the stunting had an
advantage; our practice through, we were
free, and camp leave was frequent. And
even when leave was not legitimately avail-
able, Roylc was often at the estaminet that
claimed Marie as an ornament. He had
established himself in favor, too.
Lying amidst the grass in the fields
under the spring sky, with its blue flecked
by fleecy clouds, it was possible to get
many dreams of peace from the heads of
the spring flowers that nodded gently
amongst the green. I liked to spend spare
time like. this, with a magazine for a com-
panion ; and so I heard the voices of Royle
and Marie talking beyond the hedge. I
was about to move; but it seemed a mere
friendly, laughing conversation, so I stayed.
Suddenly, however, there was a protest
from the girl.
“I’m only trying to tell you, in the right
way, that. I’d like to take you back to Aus-
tralia with me,” he insisted.
“La, la, it is not to kees me that you
need to tell me anything,” she laughed. “You
should remember Pierre —as I do.”
“Oh, hang Pierre! I’ll swear I love you,
Marie, as well as he does. And I think you
love me a bit.”
“Why, of course, I love you, Jimmee; but
I love Pierre, and I am to marry Pierre.
He is fighting for France, 'and he trusts
me.”
““Veil, he can’t blame other fellows for
wanting to kiss you. Just a kiss —what does
it matter?”
I was glad that Marie broke away from
him, for there was something in her voice
that told me she really did love Hoyle very
much; and, not being in Jimmy’s shoes
myself, I felt that loyalty to Pierre should
be considered.
It seemed they had gone a good time
when my own dry throat suggested refresh-
ments ; and I turned
towards the estaminot:
but I passed the pair
still oil the way, and
still talking earnestly
as they strolled.
There was a French
soldier in the estami-
net, a pleasant-faced
fellow, already frater-
nising. with the few
Diggers who had arriv-
ed. He turned from
them, leaping to his
feet at the cry of
“l’ierre!” as Marie
rushed to him, extend-
ing her two hands,
which he took in his
and raised to his lips.
“You two —yon must be comrades,” said
Marie, standing between Jimmy, who had
followed her, and Pierre. She was laughing;
her emotion might have been ascribed to
her sudden meeting with her lover, but her
face was at one moment white and the next
red.
There was instantly a sense of hostility
between the two men. Jimmy showed it
clearly; but in a moment, Pierre, obeying
the wish of his fiancee, leaped forward
with a hearty, outstretched hand which
Royle had to accept. It may be that so
Pierre hoped to put an obligation of com-
radeship in the way of rivalry.
Whatever Royle’s feelings, he had little
cause for impatience. Pierre’s regiment was
passing on the way to reinforce the French
troops now placed on our left, where the
Portuguese had lost the long-held Messines
ridge. Pierre had merely begged an hour of
leave to see his sweetheart.
We got the news on evening parade that
in the early morning, after stacking our
packs and surplus equipment and getting
into battle order, we were to move for the
line.
It was H'orley I met as I made my way
across the camp after getting my equipment
ready. “I don’t mind.” he said. “I hope
we go straight in and that a bullet finds me.
That’s how I feel. So let’s have a last
drink.”
Camp leave had, of course, been stopped,
but there was a way through the hedge and
across a field. How sweet the wine tastes
that you think may be the last!
We had little time, however; by regulation
the estaminets had to close early. It struck
us that it would be best for us to leave by
a rear way.
Horley fell back upon me as he opened
the door. Surprised, I looked over “. 1S
shoulder, and in the dim twilight saw Marie
seized fiercely in Jimmy’s arms.
“You have told me you love me,” he
was saying passionately. “I have made you
tell me you love me, and I know you do.
But I want your kisses, Marie. To-morrow
I am going up the line—l may not come
back. Are you going to send me away
coldly?”
She was fighting off his face with her
hands as his lips sought hungrily for hers.
“Oh, Jimmee, Jimmee!” she panted. I
do love you so my heart might break. But
Pierre —he trusts me, and he is fighting too.
He too may be killed. It is not loyal, it is
not true!”
He was about to turn when she sprang
upon him, taking his face in her hands.
“Oh, Jim-mee! Jiin-mee! You must
come back to me! God must keep you safe,
my love —my love!”
She reeled from him sobbing towards the
door. I don’t think Boyle waited to see
how she threw herself on the ground sob-
bing out her prayers and her love for lum.
He just stared as one dazed with some new
realisation, and then, turning, plunged off
towards the camp, blundering into shrubs as
he passed.
“Dirty dog!” remarked Horley as we
threaded our own way through the quickly
gathering darkness after him. “That poor
French chap! What right had Boyle”
“Oh, I don’t know. War makes things
different; we may all be dead to-morrow,”
I said. Anri then, after a pause: “Boyle
made a joke of love, but he’s got a dose of
the real thing now.”
Down in the trenches at Meteren he
showed it —a changed Boyle, alert as ever,
but pensive. Contrary to expectations, we
were comparatively quiet; the activity was
on our left towards Mont Kernel. Here
nightly, amid a. chaos of sound, there was a
carnival of lights; the flashes of the guns
roaring into action on the slopes, the flying
fragments of the shells bursting up into a
pyrotechnic display, mingling with the in-
cessantly rising Ycrey lights, the red and
green signal flares and the ground lights.
Through it we could almost see the lines of
the attacking French, dashing into the mael-
strom of fire, to be hurled back again and
again.
Intently Boyle watched it all: the flashes
of the guns gave light enough to show the
thoughtfulness of his face.
“Poor devils!” he said; and I knew him
too well to think that lie had any but good
wishes for the man who was creating such
a problem for him.
And then at last our own turn came to
spell.
We were like men reprieved as, out of
the mire of the trenches, we made our way
back into the village estaminet again. Marie,
dressed in black, flashed a gay, expectant
smile towards us, a smile of greeting, with
something also of disappointment.
“Does she know about Boyle?” I asked
Horley, finding myself seated beside him.
“The black is for the chap she was en-
gaged to —Pierre. He’s been killed,
Horley said.
The Diggers were boisterous; the gaps
were less numerous than we had expected,
and the reaction inclined us all to merry
riot. Marie bustled about with the wine;
every time the door opened her eyes flashed
towards it, always to meet disappoint-
ment.
She could bear the suspense no longer.
Several times she had paused as it about to
put the question; at last it had to be spoken :
“Where is lie? Where is Sergeant Jim-
mee?”
“Wasn’t Jimmie the sergeant that was
skittled on patrol?” asked Hawkins. He had
joined us in the line, and had not previously
been in this estaminet.
Her tray clattered on the table. She
stood like a statue, her face suddenly as
white as any marble. . , ,
“He died bravely,” I said, hurriedly fol-
lowing on the words of the blundering fool,
and then I remembered a phrase: “For the
glory of France.”
“Oh, la, la, yes! For the glory of France!
she cried with a peal of laughter; and m
a minute she was on the table singing defi-
antly and full-throatedly as she had done
when first she had impressed herself upon
me. But now, although many of the Dig-
gers joined in with her, there was. some-
thing wild, demented about her. She finished
with a shrill laugh, and then dropped on to
one knee, sobbing into her hands. Halt a
dozen w’ere ready to catch her as she tell
swooning.
* * * *
It was all this I pictured, forgetting the
verandah fronting the Eden-like garden for-
getting even the old battalion mate whose
face although not his name was remem-
bered. And he w T as talking.
“I could not help thinking of her and
her wild grief ever afterwards; and when
the war was over I took my leave in France
just to see what had become of her. In the
little village they thought her half-mad. She
loved France still; but it had become a tomb
to her. She was hoping to go to Australia;
it was the land that he had come from, the
man she had learnt to love in spite of her
wish to be loyal to her Frenchman. IV ar
makes wrecks like that: I know you re-
member how it killed my wife.”
It flashed upon me now who he was ; but
he had changed mightily.
“It seemed to me that we who had com-
through had to piece together what was
broken. She was eager to come to Australia
—and so she married me,” said Horley
simply.
“You married” I had begun; and
then my eyes, which had been cast down
as I listened to him, sprang up.
A gracious-looking woman had stolen upon
us. Leaning over her husband’s shoulder,
her hands had grasped his with understand-
ing, sympathy and gratitude.
She smiled her recognition of me as I
looked. And I knew that here, out of it
all, these two at least had garnered a rich
harvest of happiness.

The Bride of the World.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
[This, the last work of David McKee Wright,
is a short rendering of the first Irish legend in which
a man defies the power of a god and comes off
victorious. ]
I.
The walled garden of the palace of the
Aril High [High King). Apple-trees are in
bloom, and beds of flowers and herbs arc
set out in squares among the green grass,
which has been newly cut. The sunlight is
yellow on the grass. Eochy and Etain are
standing together, the man tall and young,
with clustering red curls, the woman exquis-
itely fair and graceful. He is dressed ready
for a journey in a long cloak of dark green
and gold, with a collar of thin gold about his
neck. Etain wears a thin, loose robe of pale
blue, wrought with threads of silver. Her
bright hair falls in two great plaits over her
shoulders. Each. plait is divided into four
smaller plaits, and at the cud, of each of
these is a little ball of gold, ller eyebrows,
in marked contrast to her hair, are of the
blue-black of a beetle’s shell. One of her
long, slim white hands rests on Eoehy’s
shoulder.
Etain : The time will seem very long while
you are away, Eochy.
Eochy : It will be longer for me, Etain, but
a king must do a king’s work. It will
not be longer than I can make it; for the
horses are fast, and my heart will be a
good driver.
Etain : Och, well, I can wait. It is waiting
that is the woman’s part always, even
when the woman is a queen.
Eochy: You will see Ailill every day. ITe is
my good brother, but the sickness that is
on him is a strange thing. There is no
doctor of them all can tell what it is,
but if there is healing anywhere it is in
a look from you.
Etain : I will see him, surely; and I will
nurse him myself if it will do him any
good.
Eochy : He will maybe take as quick a turn
for the good as lie took for the bad. It
would be bad luck if a man would die
of nothing at all, and him young and
strong to look at.
Etain : If he is sick he will be better com-
pany for me left alone. There is no man
I want to see but only one. When you
are at the far end of the green world,
Eochy, if you feel a wind like a touch on
your ear, that will be my thought sent to
you.
Eochy : Heart, I will tell the horses when
the time is come. If a swallow tries to
race me home I will be here before him.
Etain : Yet it will be too slow for my heart.
11.
A chamber in the king’s house. On a bed
lies Ailill keeping very still. His eyes are
closed and his face is as white as the sheet.
Etain comes in. She moves very gently to
the bedside and stands looking down at him.
Etain: Is it sleeping you are, Ailill?
Ailill : It is not. surely; but I am near
dead with waiting. Is he gone?
Etain ( coldly) : The King is gone on his
journey; blit what is it you are waiting
for?
Ailill ( sitting up) : What would a man
that has set eyes on you wait for? If. is
for the love of you, Etain; for the beauty
FAME AT LAST.
THE ACTOR ( stirring dreamily after a very fuzzy evening) : Aha, at lasht, at lasht!
I have za part in zha shpotlight (hie) at lasht!"
and the sweetness of you. There is an
ache in me and a fear and a trembling
that is like death itself. It is a flood that
drowns me in a sweet thought; it is. a
sword going through me and cutting
wounds that arc in all parts at the same
time; it is like wanting an echo to lass
and it laughing from a far hill. Och. there
is no way to be rid of it, for it sits
closer than the skin! It is two deaths
and then another death more, with no
name for the killing and me living still.
Etain (alarmed at the outburst) : But how
would i love you, Amu, being wife of
Eochy and a true woman?
Ailill : If it is truth or not I cannot tell
wanting you the way I do. 1 will die
then ; but if I die it will not kill my love
you.

Midir : It is a dream you are having now.
You were awake every day of the years
when you loved me.

you at all? Och, let me go, strange man

and a quiet music is in the air, where

your house is still waiting, with your
cloak thrown down on the bed and your
comb where you left it.
Etain (in a dreary voice) : I was born in
Ulladli, and Etar, my father, is there now ;
but I remember something far away that
is not like remembering at all, but only
dreaming when some man plays a tunc and
you hear it behind a wall,
Midir: You were born in Etar’s house
surely, but that was only this morning as
time goes with us. Look m my eyes and
see that the thing I say is true.
Etain : There is truth m your eyes.
Midir (after a pause) : Will you come
with me now, sweet woman?
Etain : I am afraid.
Midir: What is there to fear? It is your
own home; I am your own husband.
Etain (putting her hand to her forehead) :
What is it all? I am dreaming. Eochy
-will come back. Who are you, sir?
Midir: Come with me and you will remem-
Etain (struggling under the spell and
speaking quickly) : I will go if Eochy gives
me to you.
Midir: I am content. He will give you to me.
Etain turns away and the room suddenly
darkens. There is another flash.
Etain: Save us! It is destruction tliat is
upon this house.
She looks at the bed and sees Ailill lying
there cold and white.
Ailill : I had a queer dream.
Etain: Are you better now, Ailill?
Ailill : I am better, gracious lady, but full
of strange thoughts.
Etain ( slowly) : I have been dreaming, too,
Ailill. It is the storm maybe.
111.
A great room in the palace at Tara.
Eochy is seated at a table with a chcss-
board before him. At the lower end of the
room a harper is tuning a harp. Several
others are standing or sitting about in
various postures.
Eochy : Stop that twanging of the strings.
I cannot think what the next move would
be.
A servant enters.
Servant : There is a man who says he is
the best chess-player in Ireland wants to
see you.
Eochy: him come in. If lie is the best
in the world I am not afraid of him.
MAKING IT CLEAR TO JACQUELINE.
JACQUE LINE: “Oh, you fonny language! He say he could not marry me because it make
him a bigamist! Vat is a bigamist?"
ANNE: “A bigamist—oh, that’s a man who’s run short of a divorce or two.”
Midir conies in. He has a black robe that
covers him from neck to heel, with a hood
which hides his ■ bright hair.
Midir : I have heard you can play chess,
O High King!
Eociiy: What sort of man are you to come
boasting yourself this way?
Midir: I have some things to lose and some
things to win. But can you play chess?
Eociiy : Set out the pieces and see. For
what stake do we play?
Midir: Let the winner name the stake.
The first game is quickly over and Eochy
wins.
Eochy ( sitting back and laughing) : That
was an easy one. It is me to name the
stake. I will give you an easy one.
{Laughing.) Let out the water from Lough
Reagh to drain the land above. There
are fifty men at it now; but do you go
there, chess champion, and come back for
a game when the job is finished !
Eochy laughs again, and Midir sits up
in his chair without moving.
Midir : It is done. The stake is paid.
A servant enters.
Servant: 0 High King, there is a man
come from Lough Reagli to say the water
has burst out and the lough bottom
is dry stones.
Eociiy: What sort of man are you?
Midir: I can play things besides chess.
Eociiy: Will you play another game?
The pieces are again set out, and again
Eochy wins in quick time.
Midir {in a tired voice) : You play too well.
What will it be this time?
Eociiy {leaning forward, eagerly) : Find the
Queen’s necklace of sixty pearls that she
lost at last new moon.
Midir: It is found.
Etain comes in excitedly.
Etain : Eochy, I have found my pearls. They
were in the little black box all the long
time. {Seeing the hooded stranger, she
pauses, puts her lips lightly to Eochy's
forehead and turns away.) I will not
spoil your game. (She goes out.)
Eociiy : It was good finding. I will win
more yet.
Midir : You would not pay the stake
as easily if I won.
Eochy {laughing) : If you won I would pay.
Midir: You are a fine man and a good
player. If I asked to be Ard Rigli in
your place, would you give me the king-
dom?
Eociiy : It is not mine to give. Ask more
than that or less if you win. I keep
my word. Beat me if you can.
They play again, and Eochy again reins
easily. Before the game is finished Etain
comes in and looks over his shoulder. When
it is finished she claps her hands.
Etain : I doubt he is too good for you,
stranger.
Midir: What stake.?
Eochy: I can beat you with half my mind.
Here’s the. Queen, and she is the stake if
you can take her.
Etain : Have I no word in this?
Eociiy : Keep the word, heart, till he wins.
Play on.
The pieces are set and they play earnestly
and long. The others in the room crowd
about the table. Eochy makes a move and
sits back and laughs. Midir, after long
thought, makes another move.
Eochy {hoarsely): That’s not so good.
After long study he moves again. Midir
moves.
Midir : It is my turn at last.
Eochy springs from the table.
Eociiy : It was that foolish move I made.
Midir: I claim my stake.
Etain : It is I wlio speak now, stranger.
am my own and no man’s to give.
Midir suddenly throws off cloak and hood
and stands before them in his shining glory.
Midir: Come, Etain. He lias given you to
me and I have your word.
Etain: Oh, is it you? No, no, no, no.
Eocliy, save me! lam lost.
Midir: Will you pay my stake?
Eochy ( hoarsely ) : I gave him my word.
Midir conics forward and all shrink back.
He takes Etain by the hand.
Midir : Come, Etaiu. I have waited long.
He has led her, trembling, to the middle
of the room, where the roof has a great open-
ing to the sky. Eochy suddenly wakens as
if from a dream.
Eochy ( drawing his sword) : Strike him
down ! Tear her from his arms !
There is a rush t,o obey him, but before
the men can reach Midir and Etain a cloud
of glory surrounds them and they rise through
the roof. The amazed watchers see them
take the forms of flying swans.
(Eochy seeks Dalan, the greatest Druid in
Ireland, and by his aid attacks the invisible
stronghold of Midir at Bri-Leith.)

A camp before the mound of Bri-Leith.
Leather tents appear to right and left.
Armed men. pass and re-pass. There are
signs of great excavations in the centre.
Eochy and Dalan the Druid enter.
Dalan : He will be forced to it at last. The
spells I have laid ou him make him no
more than a man, only for the great
number of the spirit people he has about
him.
Eochy : We have tried a long time and I
see nothing surely done. Only that it is
for Etain I would give it up and go home.
Dalan : You may not see except when they
come out to fight like men, but I have
them in my hand. He has Etain here, and
all the spirits cannot keep her.
Eociiy : I have your word but no sure
knowledge. It is like a man fighting the
wind.
Dalan : No, but it is like a man taking
water to put out a fire. My spells and
your swords are too strong for him.
Eociiy: Look! What is this coming now?
A messenger with a headless spear comes
in.
Messenger : I am of the people of the spirits.
Dalan: Did Midir send you?
Messenger : He sent me with this word:
“Take back your wife and take off the
spells.”
Eochy: Is it a true word? Where is Etain?
You have beaten them, Dalan. It is mercy
they are asking and the war between us
won !
Messenger: Etain is on her way ivith the
young women who keep her company. You
will see her if you do what Midir asks.
Dalan : Have we his sure word that he will
trouble us no more?
Messenger : You have his word.
Dalan : Then he is free of every plague I
set upon him.
There is a sound of singing, and fifty
beautiful women enter. All are dressed
exactly alike, and all have the form and
features of Etain. Midir, looking dejected
and weary, appears with his gorgeous cloth-
ing rent and torn. Eochy stands dazed and
wondering.
Midir: I have kept my word. Etain is
here. If you want her you have only to
find her.
The women begin to cry out “I am Etain!
I am Etain!” Suddenly one among them
lifts her hand to her head. Eochy springs
forward.
Eociiy : My love, my love! I would have
known you among ten thousand.
Etain : They could not part us, Eochy.
Midir : You play love better than chess.
Etain (in Eochy’s arms) : He is my hus-
band, Midir, for all years and the year?
after. Even death shall not part us. He
has broken the wall of the world to have
me. Go back to your spirit-people in the
sweet land. There are women there for
Midir the Proud, but there is only one
man for me.

The Dream of Gow Lun
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
FROM whore Gow Lun and half a dozen
fellow-coolies potholed the hard earth
in search of the tin which was making
Hop See richer year by year, the hillside
sloped gradually to the creek where the
sluice-boxes sprawled, and where the ore was
crushed painstakingly, piece by piece, by the
most primitive of all batteries, hammers
wielded by black men and lubras.
Beyond the glittering sweep of the tidal
creek, separated from the grassed uplands
by half a mile of mangrove-covered mudflat,
spread the blue waters of the West Arm of
Bynoe Harbor, flecked by white scuds of
wind-driven foam.
KEEPING HER WORD.
“What’s the matter, Binks, old man—what you sittin' down there for?”
“Wife promised me a night-out, and she’s seeing that I have it.”
Gow TAin was small and withered and old;
the coarse slop-made clothing issued to the
coolies and charged against their pitiful earn-
by Hop See’s store hung loosely upon
his bent figure. His face was impassive and
bland as he gazed at the scene below,
one eye furtively watching the coolie
FTon See had placed in charge of the
‘ t j ia t labored at the reef; but be-
jLjf Pic pvnressionless mask a chaos of
emotion seethed.
Six years ago the agent of Flop See had
•ducked him from his humble niche among the
teemin'' millions of Canton, filling liis head
with alluring tales of the opportunity he was
going to have of becoming rich by mining for
tin in the great new land far to the south. Had
Hop See had liis way, he, Gow Lun, would
be still dependent upon him for every mouth-
ful of rice he ate: and the dream he had
dreamed as he listened to the honeyed words
of the Cantonese labor-recruiter would be as
far as ever from fruition.
As he bent half-heartedly to his toil again,
his gaze shifted to the unsightly jumble of
huts by the creek, the quarters of the labox--
master’s yellow slaves. Further off to the
right, half hidden by the sparse bush, a few
huts were dotted about the hillside. Here
lived the independent fossickers, men wba
by some means or other had
won free from Hop See’s
thraldom and put in their
lives fossicking for the tin
they sold to the white buy-
ers, Rayner and Lough, who
camped on the hill overlook-
ing Hop See’s settlement
when on their periodic visits
from Darwin.
Year after year Gow Luu
had worked, patiently dream-
ing his dream that some day
a return to old Canton would
be possible; but lately he
had begun to doubt, to real-
ise that while he worked at
Hop See’s direction the
dream would never come
true.
With the bitter knowledge
that he had been tricked had
come hatred of Hop See ; and
with the birth of this new
emotion Gow Lira had looked
about him with a new under-
standing. His awakening
mind had begun to attend to
the furtive whisperings among
the other coolies. Those
fossickers who worked inde-
pendently of Hop See’s
organisation, even while pay-
ing him tribute on every
pound of tin they won, were
the only ones amongst them
with any real chance of see-
ing again the land of their
ancestors.
But the whispers went
further, even so far as to say
that many of these indepen-
dent miners had won their
liberty by skilfully “milking”
the sluice boxes over a period
of many years, secretly dis-
posing of the tin as it accu-
mulated, and hoarding the proceeds so that
they could buy their freedom from Hop
See.
Gow Lun had listened, and said little, and
in the silence of nights, when he lay on his
hard bed stiff and sore with labor for Hop
See, he had come to the great decision. lie
had plotted patiently until he had secured a
removal from the long sleeping hut where
the coolies huddled together by night. On
the pretext of bad health he moved into a
dilapidated hut on the hillside, where he bided
his time with the patience which only an
Asiatic knows, until he was confident that
any suspicions Hop Sec might have had con-
cerning the move were lulled.
That was two years ago, and since then he
had systematically raided the sluice-boxes by
night, never removing more than a few
pounds of tin at a time, and covering his
tracks with never-failing skill. Four or five
pounds of tin stolen nearly every night soon
becomes a hundredweight, and Gow Lun
found Rayner and Lough ready enough to
purchase all he could obtain. True, he knew
that they robbed him, gave him but a fraction
of the value of the tin, but he was well satis-
fied, seeing always that dream of a trium-
phant return to old Canton coming closer to
fulfilment.
H'e had no compunction about robbing Hop
See’s sluices. The labor-master was rich, a
great beast of a man, ruthless in the exploi-
tation of his countrymen and the degenerate
aboriginals who gathered about the camp,
eager to labor in return for a few trade goods
or a little forbidden liquor. And he, Gow
Lun, had been tricked by Hop See’s agent,
as dozens of others had been tricked at Flop
See’s instigation.
Now the goal was in sight. During the
two years since his abused spirit had rebelled
he had accumulated almost enough to buy
himself free from the indentures binding him
to Hop See’s labor gangs. Nobody but a
Chinaman would have had the iron patience
to do what he had done, make raids night
after night during all those months, never
exceeding what he knew could be removed in
comparative safety.
Yet, with the longed-for independence so
close at hand, even Gow Lun’s patience was
wearing thin. In his dull mind one thought
was burning as he slugged at the ore at the
foot of the narrow rabbit-warren trench,
Liberty was close now, so close, and if he
dared to make a few big raids on the sluice-
boxes it w r ould be entirely wutliin reach.
But it was necessary to act quickly, for
THE WRONG CATCH.
SQUATTER: “What you bin beltem Mary for, Jacky?”
JACKY: “Me bin send him after goanna; him bin catchem plurry lounge lizard.”
the buyers were almost ready to leave for
Darwin, and they would not be back for a
month or more. If only he dared accept the
risk for a night or two!
Already dusk was falling, darkening the
blue of the sea and transforming the ugliness
of the jumbled huts and the spreading mud-
flats beyond to something of almost beauty.
Gow Dun glanced again at the gang boss.
The man was standing alongside the trench
in which the other coolies delved, his eyes
fixed on the huts below. Gow Lun knew
what he was waiting for —the signal for the
gangs to cease work.
He picked away mechanically, his mind
racing over and over his own problem. It
was still unsolved when the gang-leader gave
the word to knock off.
He left his companions halfway down the
hillside, deviating along the ridge to where
his miserable, slab-sided hut perched crazily.
He lit a fire and cooked his evening rice care-
fully, noting abstractedly that it would be
necessary for him to draw a new ration next
day. He ate sitting in the doorway, watching
with something like pleasure in his dark eyes
the storm-clouds banking up from the west.
In an hour or two they would have spread
sufficiently to hide the light of the moon, mak-
ing any attempt on the sluices safer than
ever.
To Gow Lun those dark clouds were an
omen of success. It seemed that the gods
of his ancient faith were fighting for him, so
that the dear dream of . returning to lay his
bones among those of his ancestors might not
go unfulfilled. It was this queer Oriental
faith in that combination of circumstances
white men call luck that decided him. More
months of subservience to Hop See seemed
now impossible. The slow fire of rebellion
which had driven him to stealthy theft had at
last burst into full flame, and Gow Lun,
patient and gentle ordinarily as any beast of
burden, was roused to fighting pitch, ready
to kill or be killed for the sake of that
cherished dream.
But a new thought was obtruding now.
Why should he purchase freedom from Hop
See? He had earned it, with sweating brow
and aching muscles, over and over again.
A plan infinitely more attractive was assert-
ing itself. He would remove as much tin
as was possible during the next few nights,
supposing the gods allowed him to escape
detection. Then, with it sold, he would make
for Darwin. There he would find someone
willing to give him employment at much
better rates than Hop See offered, and in a
few years he could return to Canton, rich
according to the standard of his class. The
new scheme excited him, and while he
watched the dark cloud-mountains steal
toward the pallid moon, he planned and
planned, giving his starved imagination free
rein.
The scudding outriders of cloud dimmed
the moon at length, followed soon by thicker
billowing masses which obliterated it alto-
gether. A low wind came moaning from the
landward side, and far out at sea a sheet of
heat lightning flickered and blazed. Gow
Lun picked up the strong bag he had fash-
ioned from a pair of dungaree trousers and
set off towards the sluices. A few yards
from the shanty door he hesitated, then re-
traced his steps and groped in the darkness
along the ledge above his bunk. He returned
to the door, the faint glow from the few
live coals in the hearth glinting on polished
steel as he slipped the knife into the pocket
of his earth-stained trousers.
For a while he went boldly enough along
a track where he knew every twist and
jutting boulder. It was a well-trodden path,
used by the fossickers working this part of
the tmfield on their trips to Hop See s store,
Gow Lun deviated from the track while
still some distance from the liuts. vvhere a
few 7 lights still showed, and made directly to
where, the sluice-boxes, primitive hand-worked
affairs, sprawled just above high-water mark,
Here by day forty or fifty aborigines, bucks,
lubras ’and children old enough to swing the
crushing hammers, worked on the ore carted
to them from the potholes. Now the place
was silent, the only sound the splashing
of the waters upon the rock-bound shore and
the low moan of the rising wind.
Gow Lun did what he had to do swiftly,
rifling from each of the four sluices handful
after handful of the heavy black metal which
lay against the riffle bars on the bottom,
hoping almost against his better judgment
that even this large theft would be undetected.
The sack packed with all the tin he could
comfortably carry, he went slowly toward the
humpy.
The storm which had been working up
since sunset was closer now, the silence shat-
tered intermittently by the growl of the thun-
der and the darkness shouldered aside by
eye-searing flickerings of lightning. Gow Lun
added haste to his steps, a little afraid lest
the glow should betray him to some chance
watcher from Hop See’s village. Yet it was
late, far too late, for anyone to be abroad on
such a night of storm.
He put the sack on the ground and stopped
to rest his weary back and arms. He looked
behind him towards Hop See’s huts. The
last light had gone out. and below him was
nothing but, a sheet of blackness out of which
came the swish of wind-tossed branches and
the dull boom of the sea. Then a blinding
flash of blue-white flame ripped the darkness
like a knife, showing for a second the hud-
dled huts and the dark water beyond with
amazing distinctness. Gow Lun shielded his
eyes, and as he drew his hands away he
started. What was it he had seen? A dark
shape that merged into the bushes at the
side of the track? It could have been a man,
or it could have been one of the goats that
roamed at will upon the scarred hillside. It
could even have been a trick played upon his
keyed-up senses by lightning-dazzled eyes.
Nevertheless Gow Lun was frightened.
Il'is hand slid to the .pocket' in which he
had placed the knife, and he drew it, strain-
ing his eyes the while in a vain attempt to
pierce the darkness. Even the lightning glow
which could have helped him did not come
now, and for a minute, that seemed an hour
he stood irresolute, in the grip of a fear which
ebbed slowly before a black wave of wrath.
Was he to be balked when so close upon his
goal? No! He felt the needle-point of the
knife, then started silently towards the spot
where he had caught sight of that vanishing
something.
Before he had covered more than five or
six yards the heavens blazed again. Gow
Lun kept his eyes open this time, his gaze
directed on the clump of bush which he
imagined sheltered the object he had seen.
He lunged forward in the blackness that fol-
lowed, a jargon of iCantonese speech on his
tongue, and found nothing. He stopped in
momentary bewilderment, then began to hunt
from bush to bush, the conviction gradually
forming that he had been mistaken, that
what he had seen had been merely some freak
shadow from the lightning glare or a trick
of his own imagination. He returned to
the bag of tin, lifted it, and went hurriedly
past the humpy to the pile of boulders a
few hundred yards behind it, the spot where
all along lie had hidden his gleanings from
Hop See’s sluices.
By the time he returned to the hut his
uneasiness had almost fled, and he turned
in to sleep the sleep of utter exhaustion
until daylight, filtering through the wide
cracks between the slabs, wakened him.
He rose, cooked the last of his rice, and
went wearily forth to face another day

THE KE.W LIGHT DEEP


of slavery for Hop See. Yet in spite of his
bodily weariness his mind was very much
alive, seething with long-remembered scenes
and characters from the old Canton he had
known, and which seemed now so near.
_lt was early; he had set out in time to
visit the store in order to replenish his
supply of rice. The storm of the night before
had left the air as cool and sparkling as a
draught of good wine. He strode amongst
Hop See’s huts confidently, passing a few
coolies he knew and a dozen lounging abori-
ginals who stared at him with the stolid
interest of their kind.
The store held only a gaunt abo. engaged
in earnest conversation with Hop See. As
(low Tain crossed the threshold Hop See took
a black bottle from the shelf behind him and
passed it over the counter. He muttered
something in the language of the tribe, and
the man shuffled away, looking boldly at Gow
Lun as he passed.
The coolie stated his wants, finding it hard
to keep back a smile of triumph at the
thought that he would soon escape the domi-
nation of this obese brute who held his
laborers in such utter subjection.
Had he not been so obsessed by the thought
of his coming triumph he must surely have
noticed something strange in Hop See’s
manner, a cruel glint in the piggy eyes set
deep in the bloated face, a twist to the thin
lips beneath the grey moustache.
“Rice, Gow Lun? Just wait—l will get
it from the new stock in the storeroom.”
He paused. “Your health is improved since
you moved to the hut?” he inquired.
“Yes, Master. I find I work much better.
Surely you have report of me?” Gow Lun
replied with well-assumed humbleness.
Hop See smiled. “Yes, Gow Lun, I have
report of you,” he answered, and shuffled
from the shop into the storeroom, returning
presently with a calico sack of rice.
Gow Lun carried the rice to his hut, then
went straight to the reef on which his gang
had been working. The hours dragged slowly
past, and he picked and shovelled carelessly,
indifferent as to whether he incurred the
ganger’s wrath. Tin' sun dipped, and after
a twilight which seemed an eternity the
signal to cease work was given.
Hungry and tired, yet too excited by the
glamorous thoughts which flooded his brain
to give much heed to his physical discom-
forts, Gow Lun hurried to the humpy. While
he waited for some of the rice to cook he
packed a light swag, thinking always of the
triumphal end of his dream. He had no
thought of disaster now —he believed in his
luck, and was sure that nothing could harm
him. not even that Hop See whom he had
so foolishly feared for years, and who, he
knew, had had a hand in the death of more
than one intending escapee.
He squatted at his meal on the doorstep
of the humpy, with the soft dark coming
down over the far sea, and the lights coming
up one by one among the huts by the inlet
below. Ho was hungry enough to make
short we- v of the rice, and afterwards he

rolled one of the cigarettes he had learned to
smoke in this new 7 land.
Tie was still on the doorstep when three
shuffling figures, vague and unrecognisable
in the failing light, came into sight from a
clump of bush a hundred yards away, and
want slowd.v up the track towards the crest
of the hill ’ Gow- Lun watched them indiffer-
ontly. Three of the independent fossickers,
he surmised, returning from Hop See’s store,
The corner of the hut blotted out their dark
figures.
Gow Lun raised a hand and clapped it to
hi s heart. A wave of faintness assailed him,
so that he found himself fighting for breath,
What was wrong? A sudden appalling sense
of terrible evil took hold of him, and he
staggered to liis feet, clutching at the crazy
door-jamb for support. He tried to think
what was it? .
Hop See had won somehow! The rice.
Hop See had poisoned the rice! He cried
out sharply, and on the instant, as though
they had been waiting for the sound, three
men came round the corner of the hut, one
of them staggering beneath the weight of a
heavy bag. He dropped it at Gow Lun s
stepped back. It was the stolen tin.
The fire within the hut was spraying a
of unsteady light from the doorway, so
that £ ow Lun could recognise the men—
Hop See, with a grin parting his thin bps,
Wee Hong, his ganger, staring with tiight-
elle<l eyos ; and the gaunt aboriginal he had
seen with Hop See that morning.
Gow Lun could feel his strength ebbing

repeated the words. “You’ve won!”
The labor-master came a step closer,
“FooD Did you think you could beat me?
Ackarra watched you last night. Bah!” He
spa t a t Gow Lun’s feet.
A mighty surge of rage rushed over Gow
T,un, and he released his grip on the door
to tug at the knife in his trouser-pocket,
As it came free he swayed like a drunken
man, grabbed futilely at the door-jamb, and
fell headlong at Hop Sees feet,

Tich Carries On.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
EVEN now I believe I could mark the
spot, two kilometres out from the
town, where that friendship between
Smithy and Tich commenced. Twelve years
has in no way dimmed my memory, and if
I close my eyes I can see again that long
Flemish road stretching straight as a ruled
line; its time-worn cobbles hollowed and
uneven; the culverts grass-grown and grey
with dust. I can recall how the flank-
ing poplars, tall leafy old sentinels, met
the rays of the setting sun and cast thin,
slanting shadows in delicate tracery over
road and grassland.
We were moving slowly forward in full
marching order, perspiring, weary and silent,
save for the stroke of the accoutrements'
and the tramping feet.
Twenty kilos up ; and, by the signpost at
the crossroads, two still to go.
We didn't know Tich then ; he was one
of a batch of reinforcements which had
joined us that morning before the march,
and by evening the poor little beggar was
clean out to it. He told us about it later,
Each time he heaved the sagging pack higher
on his back the shoulder-straps cut like hell,
The haversack chafed his side like a brand-
ing-iron, and every tap of his blistered heels
on the cobbles sent a dull thud racing :o
his brain; a punch to every raw nerve m
his body.
He began to count, keeping time with
the tramping feet. One-—two—three. Put-
tees everywhere;. forward, then back in
drowsy rhythm. He wanted to lie down,
stretch out his aching body on the road and
sleep. He closed his eyes until the sunset
and shadows faded, the beating click of
the boots grew fainter. Gradually he re-
laxed ; it was rest to be away from the
crowd where he could slacken his muscles
and His foot skidded on the rounded

cobbles and he stumbled forward. He licked
his parched lips, and bending slightly for-
ward, commenced again. One—two
Suddenly he felt a hand on his shoulder,
and looking up he saw Smithy. Smithy
was a tall, wiry streak, in tailored uniform
and jaunty tilted hat; about the whitest
man in the battalion.
Without a word Smithy gently unclasped
Tich's belt and shoulder-straps, and, swing-
ing the whole equipment over liis shoulders,
stepped out with the double load towards
the town.
It did our hearts good to see Tich; he
gazed up with astonishment at the dust-
lined, grimy face of the big man swinging
along so easily beside him. Once before I
had seen that expression, in a picture called
“The Good Shepherd.” It hung in our little
wooden church in the Mallee.
Something new began to sing beneath
Tich’s tunic, and, squaring his shoulders,
he broke into step beside Smithy.
Midnight found. him among the straw in
the draughty barn. He couldn’t sleep, but
stai*ed up at the moonlight through the
chinks in the tiles, and his mind tramped
again those two kilometres to the town.
Some day, he determined, he would carry an-
other dhap’s pack for him, or pay back to
Smithy what he owed —just to see how it
felt from the other side.
He was a queer little chap, not the kind
one expected to see in a war ; and from then
on when we saw Smithy we looked for
Tich.
Three weeks later we were detailed to
take over the line in front of Warneton,
and in the chill twilight I saw Smithy
plodding along the duckboards in the Douvre
Valley. Tich was immediately behind him.
It was a fairly stiff introduction for Tich,
because Fritz kept the track constantly
under tire; but lie knew what was expected
of a pal of Smithy’s when Smithy himself
set the lead.
I saw a shell crash on the hard ground
behind them and splinter the earth, shower-
ing it everywhere. Tich never looked back
but, pacing evenly, went toward the line.
The last twenty yards to the trench was
over the open,, and hunched silhouettes
raced the distance between flares and
machine-gun bullets. As we reached the
protection of the trench I saw that Tich
could scarcely stand; his rifle shook from
his grasp and he pressed close into the
trench wall, gasping for breath. I heard
Smithy speak to him, and Tich just laughed
and pulled himself together again.
It was a death-trap, that stretch of line,
one of the worst the battalion had experi-
enced. We seemed to be in a cross-fire for
all Fritz’s machine-guns, and the “Minnies”
plomped without ceasing.
Two days later Smithy’s younger brother,
Jim, got his issue. He was always a care-
less devil, and would poke and peer around
without the slightest precaution. He was
gazing over the top when he got it right be-
tween the eyes, and fell without a word.
It was another present from the “Doll’s
House,” the deadliest sniper in the sector.
In a moment I was at his side, but the
spreading halo of purple told its own tale;
Jim had gone west.
I’ll never forget the way Smithy took
that. He just looked down at his brother’s
form, then leaned back against the trench,
and the lines of his mouth hardened til] his
lips were only two bands across his face.
No one'seemed able to-break the. spell until
Tich white as death, went to him and put
his arm on his shoulder. It seemed to
arouse Smithy. “Son,” he said fiercely. “I
have only to-day and to-morrow left to get
that as he got Jim, and nothing will
stop me.”
Smithy was a religious kind of chap, and
I had never heard him swear before. He
was deeplv hit.
We carried Jim behind the lines and
buried him near the duckboard track, and
when we came back Smithy dug himself in
with his rifle toward the “Doll’s House.”
All day, with set face, he watched silently,
eating' nothing. Tich sat beside him. Once
I saw him raise his rifle and take deliber-
ate aim—then he put it down again. Just
before sunset he turned to Tich. “Tich,”
he said bitterly, “I was wrong when I said
that nothing would stop me. That will.”
He pointed away over the line to where a
thick fog came rolling like a cloud up the
valley; then, placing his hands on Tick’s
shoulders, he looked down at him. “This
fog might hang around for days,” he said,
“We're beaten on the post, Littlun.”
Then slowly he pulled the safety-catch of
liis rifle over, and deliberately lowered the
sights.
About two in the morning they pulled
me out for duty. The moon must have been
somewhere, for even in the fog I could see
the mist-drops hanging on the rusty wires
in front. It was the quietest night I had
known, hardly a sound from either side of
the line, and as I leaned against the damp
earth I seemed to be in a little world of
my own.
I bowed my head forward, and but for
the cold I should have slept. I must have
dozed, for I suddenly started up. Some-
thing shattered in my ears, and the flares
were bending and breaking in the misty
light. The earth rocked on its base. Every
enemy gun seemed to be in action, and in
three minutes our line was standing-to. The
shells thudded and crashed and sizzled;
smashing the sandbags down, heaving the
earth up ; searching high, then low. Clipping
the parapet, slashing the wires whining
overhead.
Our guns opened immediately, and with
every nerve tingling I waited. I knew that
Fritz would not attack in a fog like this,
so I strained close into the trench.
Then above tbe pandemonium I heard one
shell with a peculiar singing sound ; I knew
it was coming to us. It whizzed straight
down into the trench with a blinding flash.
I reeled from the impact, but a moment
later stood quite unhurt amidst a cloud of
acrid fumes and smoke. I was rattled, I
admit it, but pulled myself together as I
saw Smithy stumble toward me.
“Have you seen Tich?” lie shouted. “I
can’t find' him anywhere. He must have
been buried with, that shell.”
We hurried back along the trench, and
with fingers frozen and bleeding, hurled the
debris away. Smithy worked like a giant,
heaving great pieces of iron over the para-
dos ; wrenching broken wire and boards.
But we could not find Tich.
We stood • straight for a moment, and
each read the other’s thoughts, but neither
dared put them into words.
The shelling continued, mostly away be-
hind us, and then it ceased abruptly.
Along the whole trench we searched, but
none had seen Tich.
He came back just before dawn—through
the wires in the front. Laughing quietly to
himself, his eyes bloodshot, his face covered
in dirt. Under cne arm a broken sniper’s
rifle : in the ether a - German helmet and a
bundle of stick-bombs.
Still laughing, lie jumped into the trench,
and called Smithy. “That’s the last pre-
sent from the “Doll’s House,” he said
simply, as he handed Smithy the sniper’s
rifle and flicked the dusjy from his tunic.

The Watching Cat.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
IDO believe that you see the ghosts
That lightly flit through this grey old
house—
The ghost of a pale old cat that boasts
A bygone prowess with bird or mouse;
And the ghosts of children who used to move
Through the dusky corners you seem to love.
Sometimes in the dark your eyes are green
As emeralds found in an Indian mine ;
And then they are grey with a golden sheen,
Like shallow waters where pebbles shine;
With your proud white chest and your
whiskers spread
You stare at something above your head.
That cats see fairies I always knew —
They follow them in the garden ways,
A goblin dance where the violets grew,
A fairy court where the fountain plays:
Strangely marked with your grey and brown,
You have found the stair that the ghosts
come down:
The babe who died ere she learned to know
The world that stretched from a nursery
door;
The boy whom a foreign shell laid low
They tiptoe over the polished floor
To stroke with a loving hand your fur
While we puzzle over that sudden purr.
I see only the firelight on the wall,
The orange leap of a merry flame;
But lying there in a silky ball
You find the way that the children came.
What is this soul that a mortal boasts?
Cats see fairies—and cats know ghosts!
QUEENSLAND.
M. FORREST.
Three Dances—and Four.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
I AM seated in the dress-circle at a Pav-
lova first-night. The curtain rises. Three
Japanese miniatures. Exquisite, no
doubt, but, like the Japanese garden near the
Melbourne Treasury, certainly not Japanese.
The girls are too tall. They restrain their
exuberance inside tight skirts with difficulty.
My mind wanders. I am in a back room in
a squalid tenement in Penang. It is a hot
night. The odor of durians pours through
the window along with the bells and yells of
the rickshaw coolies. Three Japanese girls
are dancing while one sits on the floor
strumming on a battered samisen. It is a
lascivious dance, a sensual story, a story
that begins in illicit love and ends in sordid
tragedy. But how effective! One girl sticks
a fan in her belt for a sword and pretends
to be a youthful samurai. He is in love
with O Hatsa San, poor little crushed waif
of the yosliiwara. We are wafted to Tokio—
Tokio in the grip of winter. The room seems
suddenly to have grown cold, although the
air is so stifling that one’s head sweats. The
third girl becomes comically stern and pom-
pous. She is the youth’s father. He forbids
the marriage, not without reason, for O
Platsa San is his mistress. The youth bows
to the parental mandate. He will not marry
O Hatsa San, but may he see her for the
last time? The father consents and the lover
tramps sorrowfully through the snow to the
yosliiwara. There is a passionate meeting,
and they spend a final night together, for
the father is not so stony-hearted as, under
the circumstances, a father might be. But
in the morning, when he comes, he finds
the couple gone. Betrayed by a mistress,
NONE TOO GOOD A RECORD EITHER.
“Ah, think, my friend, of all the homes that have been wrecked
by whisky!”
“Yes, Father, but what about all the ships that have been
wrecked by water?”
disobeyed by a son, he is alternately horri-
fied and furious. There is a final scene.
The unhappy couple are trudging through
the sleet on the outskirts of the city. They
reach a railway-line, and, standing between
the metals, they embrace for the last time.
Then the samurai beheads the girl, and,
omitting none of the ceremony demanded by
the occasion, disembowels himself.
The strum of the samisen fades into the
wailing of the Australian orchestra. The
smell of durians resolves into the odor
of Tons les Fleurs carried by the stout
woman in the seat below me, and the shuffle
of stockinged feet is lost in the rattle of
bangles on the ankles of Pavlova’s ballet.
They are dancing “A Hindu Wedding”
now. .
My mind drifts away to Jogjakarta, it
is raining in Jokja—sheets of water as
opaque as galvanised-iron. I put on evening
dress for an audience with the Sultan. A
letter signed by the editor of The Bulletin
is the talisman which has opened the secret
gates of his Kraton. In the shabbiest andong
fn Jokja, drawn by the tiniest rats of ponies,
I drove to the Kraton. The Dutch Assistant-
Resident, his Controleur and their ladies
are there to meet me, and my andong is
ignominiously dismissed. Luxurious motors
carry us through the gateway into the dark
streets where 15,000 of the Sultan’s retain-
ers and poor relations quarrel and intrigue,
and where their plenitude of wives quarrel
and experiment on their rivals with strange
poisons. We dismount at the Dalam, the
Holy of Holies. There is a guard of honor
armed with pikes and Crimean muskets.
A dozen princes, each a two-sword man
with an enormous kris and a dirk thrust
into his sash for full measure, meet us.
Hooked noses, slit eyes, pouting lips slightly
moustached. Proud, arrogant, but as courtly
as so many English butlers. Each on the
arm of a prince we arc leu to the tune
ONE OF THOSE MISLEADING LADIES.
“I hear your husband has an interest in a theatrical company?”
“Yes. A little blonde hussy!”
of the Dutch national anthem to a huge
enclosed space set with three gigantic archi-
tectural mushrooms. A 1000-c.p. light under
the roof makes each of these look like an
enormous phosphoric toadstool which, as
we approach it, grows and grows under the
torrential downpour. Under one toadstool
stands the European band. Under another
squats the gamelang—the native orchestra.
The third is the royal pavilion—gold and
red-lacquered columns; heavy beams picked
out in red and yellow. We bow three times
to the Sultan, who is standing on the door-
step of his mushroom like a stout little fairy
godfather. As to the upper part, he is
dressed like an Eton schoolboy; as to the
lower, in a sarong with a design which, my
prince informs me, inflicts with an incurable
skin disease any
commoner presump-
tuous enough to
wear it.
But where are
our courtly escorts?
They have disap-
peared, and w e
have to search the
floor for them.
They have gone
down on their
haunches and are
crawling towards
the Sultan like gro-
tesque saurians!
Comic opera? By
no means. Mil-
lions of Javanese
worship this stout
puppet of the Euro-
pean power as a
human deity.
We seat our-
selves in chairs
arranged in a stiff
row across the
royal mushroom,
flanked on each side by princes with sneer-
ing upper lips and two thousand years of
bloody history behind them. The grandfather
of the one on my right krised seven of his
daughters just to see whose blood would
spurt the highest. Hordes of retainers sud-
denly materialise out of the surrounding
darkness. They undulate towards us balanc-
ing . trays of cigars, whisky and terrible
Malay sweetmeats, and remain at the level
of our elbows. Retiring, they hold their
bodies upright, their knees bent, their feet
invisible under their sarongs and their hands
free to perform the sembali, or obesiance,
a feat only possible to human reptilians.
They hop backwards off the raised floor of
the mushroom into the pouring rain, and
only then turn their backs, stand suddenly
erect and walk off like decent human beings.
This crawling about makes the whole
evenimr seem a little monstrous, slightly
weird and horrible, as if this ancient civilisa-
tion had gone rotten or imbecile and lost
all sense of reality. But we get used to
human slugs before the evening is over.
The ballet lasts three hours, and is then
only an abbreviated fragment. The game-
lang begins. A music without beginning and
without end, like the spawning life •of the
kraton and the jungle outside it. Haunting,
greasy, a little sinister, as if the screams
of myriads of victims of Oriental despotism
had been harmonised in it.
Women dressed in dark colors crawl into
the cyclonic illumination and unfold the
“book”- —the sacred verses of the Mahabha-
rata. The master of ceremonies apologises
to it before he opens it. A shrill chant and
a rustling behind us give warning of some-
thing arriving. We turn our heads and
the nine bedoyas glide slowly out of the
darkness and crouch in front of us. Bida-
daris, heavenly nymphs, members of a ballet
which has existed continuously since and
before the sculptors depicted it thirteen
centuries ago on the neighboring temple of
Burubudur. The Sultan has eighty-one
wives, so it is not surprising to learn that
he has no difficulty in manning his ballet
from the ranks of his own family. They are
all his daughters.
The dance begins. It is as conventional
as the floral designs on the jewelled sarongs
the girls are wearing. It is as alien from
the passionate reality of Western dancing
as a straight-eight is from a bullock-cart.
Seven of the children, looking like fright-
ened mice that have fallen into a packet of
kalsomine, sidle to and fro, twist their arms
and fingers and slowly circle round, while
two others squat and hold up emblems for
scenery. Only now and then the seven break
into a more rapid movement. Yet possibly
it is a more exhausting performance than
more energetic dancing, as each is painted on
face, neck, feet and arms with yellow ochre
which prevents their bodies performing their
proper function of breathing.
The performance is over. We are told that
it represents a passionate love romance. By
way of a curtain, the Sultan’s youngest
daughter is allowed to crawl back and shake
each of us by the hand.
The row of chairs breaks up
and the Sultan relaxes. He
does us the honor of show-
ing us his bridal bed, which
looks large enough to con-
tain all his eighteen help-
mates simultaneously. As
we depart we pass a barred
window at which are crowd-
ed the faces of as many of
the Sultan’s wives as can •
find accommodation. We
give orders for sweetmeats
to be distributed amongst
them.
Pavlova is dancing in her
own ballet of “Krishna and
lihada.” What a miracle of
grace she is, so light, so in-
finitely subtle, so extra-
human ! But no, not Orien-
tal. The ballet is a conven-
tional romance that any
Anglican bishop might sanc-
tify with his blessing. My
attention begins to wander.
I am in Labuan, Borneo.
Hateful little spot, and of
the seventeen white people
on it none hated it so much
as young Lanscombe. Queer,
taciturn. Never discussed
his own affairs, even in
monosyllables. Spent his
time morosely tramping about
the island. I was his best
friend, if he had one. He
was an individualist. So
much of one that he was the
only man who had the cour-
age to dare tin l gossip-mon-
gers and openly establish a
menage out in the country.
A Tutong woman, quiet, submissive, almost
as taciturn as Lanscombe.
Out there, in a clearing in the jungle, he
created a grotesque imitation of a suburban
residence. An atap-roofed house on stilts,
with a vegetable garden, in which he actually
succeeded in growing tomatoes. Then he sur-
prised everybody by sacking the Tutong
woman and applying for leave to go to
Singapore to marry a girl to whom lie had
been engaged in Australia. H’e used to have
her photos all over his room in the quarters,
but had removed them when the company
brought iu a rule that none of its staff could
get married until after twelve years of
tropical service. Presumably he had told the
girl that it wasn’t a fair thing for any man
to ask a girl to wait so long when there
were stacks of decent chaps in Sydney. The
rule had just been rescinded.
He hadn’t been five days away when my
“boy” invited me to see a berhantu. Tuan
Lanscombe’s woman, it appeared, was not
going to let a white rival oust her without
a struggle.
It was a five-mile walk to the house along
a moonlit jungle path, and the air was full
of the foreboding which, laugh at it if you
like, is always latent in the tropics. We
could hear the inuflled thudding of the gand-
rongs long before we reached the clearing.
It was a public occasion apparently. Lighr
filtered from every pore of the house, which
rocked wildly on its spindly legs. Inside it
was hot and variously perfumed. A single
oil-lamp hanging from the ceiling lit up the
audience: Kadayan women in plush coats
faced with red and hung with gold bells;
Brunei maidens with figured sarongs drawn
tight over their heads so that only their
black eyes looked out; Murut, Dusun and
Dyak women ; the better-caste wives of the
Sikh police, finely featured ladies with deep-
set eyes and single gems set in their aquiline
noses; scores of Malay youngsters, a few
awake, but most fast asleep and all laden
with jewellery ; the men squatting round on
the inside of the circle. Oscar Asche could
not have staged things better.
A witch-doctor, naked to the waist except
for a white cord across his chest, began
droning a mantra. From the orchestra came
a soft plaintive accompaniment. Suddenly
Lanscombe’s woman broke from the hags who
had been massaging her and tottered into
the middle of the circle. She had been danc-
ing for three -days and nights, my “boy” in-
formed me, without reaching her objective.
Her sarong was tied tightly just above the
breast and out of a face as blank as a sheet of
paper stared two dead eyes.
She swayed gently from the waist. Her
long fingers begin to twitch. The motion
spreads to her wrists. Presently her arms
are undulating, and slowly the motion
spreads like an inflammation to the whole
body, until one can imagine under her clothes
the dorsal muscles chasing up and down her
thighs. It is an uncanny involuntary
movement, like the slapping to and fro of
waves in a still pool stirred by something
unseen and mysterious. The orchestra wails
and throbs and the witch-doctor is gleaming
with the sweat of some internal crisis.
Through a small square window I can see
the moon, which angry clouds are endeavor-
ing to tear out of a cocoanut-tree, in which
it has got entangled.
Unexpectedly the music rises to a climax,
a climax of reedy excitement that sets the
ears tingling, and then collapses like a heap
of kero.-tins. The witch-doctor scuttles forward
as the girl slithers like an empty sack to
the carpet, with foam flecking her lips; he
plies her with anxious questions and receives
a weary answer. Unsatisfactory, apparently.
The bags drag the dancer back into their
corner and recommence massaging.
“The wrong spirit possessed her, Tuan,”
my Bornean “boy” explains things. “The
Spirit of the Tideways came to her and she
wanted the Spirit that Unties Knots.”
“And why does she want the Knot Un-
tier?”
“So that Tuan Lanscombe will come back
from Singapore without his white girl.”
On my way home a few hours later I
heard the noise in the clearing behind me
rise suddenly to a confused crescendo. Loud
shouts of excitement rang across the silent
jungle and there seemed to be a note of exul-
tation even in the sullen booming of the
gandrong. Then the uproar suddenly sub-
sided. The body of Lanscombe’s woman had
evidently become the temporary dwelling-
place of the Knot Untier !
A week later Lanscombe returned from
Singapore unaccompanied and resumed his
moody walking about the island. Nobody had
the nerve to ask him any questions, and he
THE USUAL THING.
GRAN'MA: “And after Samson pulled down the temple
of the Philistines, what followed?”
GEORGINA: “Oh, I suppose there was a short interval
to join up the film.”
was never the sort of chap to volunteer
information. After a week or so he returned
to the Tutong woman and the cultivation
of his vegetable garden.
Pavlova has finished her “Oriental Im-
pressions” and the applause is breaking on
the falling curtain like a roll of thunder. Out
she comes again and back and out again.
Exquisite! Not of this world! Like a bar
of Mendelssohn’s most fairy-like music.
“Wonderful,” says the stout lady with the
perfume. “And so like the Orient.”

The Maxwell Case.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
“TV /TR. FORSYTH, Doctor,” said the
y I maid, and closed the door upon
them.
“Hullo there, John—what brings you out
a night like this?”
“It is a bit sloppy, but the rain is wel-
come. And having no wife to chide mo nor
car to carry me, I walked.”
“Anything the matter?”
“No; fit as a fiddle, so far as health goes.
Just a bit worried, that’s all, so I thought
I’d ease my mind to my oldest friend—as
I suppose you are.”
“Probably, as I brought you into the
world, if that’s an act of friendship. Sit
up to the fire —nothing like nursing one’s
worry in comfort —and fill your pipe. Recog-
nise my old meerschaum? I’ve had it for
umpty-um years.... Not through with the
case yet—l thought it was to finish to-day?”
“No, gone over till Monday.”
“That’s the worry, I suppose, eh ?”
“Well, it is and it isn’t. You know I’ve
more than a professional interest in it?”
Oldfield nodded.
“Mrs. Maxwell is not merely a client I
am defending on a murder charge, but a
woman whom I’ve known almost from child-
hood. Her mother and mine were close
friends.”
“Yes, so my wife tells me —women know
all about these things. You were engaged,
I believe?”
“Roy and girl affair; but I had nothing
to marry on. The Bar’s a waiting game;
and, of course, one couldn’t string a girl
on from year to year, so"
“She married Maxwell.”
“Yes; you knew him, of course?”
“In a way, but not intimately. I was
called in professionally to his wife, but
saw very little of him.”
“You’ve heard, I suppose, he turned out
a rotter?”
“I’ve heard it said. They’ve been living
in separate apartments since the death of
the child, I believe?”
“Yes. That completely changed her. A
more lovable girl you could not have known
—till then.”
“f low did she come to marry him? Didn’t
the parents make any inquiry?”
“What inquiry does any parent make in
the face of wealth and social position? He
was good-looking, attractive in a flash sort
of way—what the women call ‘a good catch.’
Her folk walked the tiglit-rope over an abyss
of debts.”
“11-m-m. So that was the end of romance !
Why didn’t you take it philosophically, John
—marry a nice comfortable widow with a bit
of money?”
Forsyth shrugged his shoulders.
“Well, my boy. let’s come to the point.
I suppose you want to save her for the sake
of—call it'auld lang syne?”
“But, surely, Doctor, you don’t mean ‘save
her'! You can’t really believe she murdered
him ?”
“My dear chap, I haven’t heard all the
evidence, and you have. All I know is that
DOES MARRIAGE END ALL?
“So that’s the girl he’s going to marry?”
“Yes—and he’s going to a lot of trouble, too.”
I found enough arsenic in the man’s stomach
to kill three men.”
“But she didn’t give it to him. I’d
pledge my soul on that.”
“Pledging your soul’s all very well —-can
you prove it? That arsenic didn’t get
where I found it without someone placing
it there. It wasn’t a mistake in the pre-
scription. I read the ’script—about a thir-
tieth of a grain, quite a usual tonic dose
that couldn’t possibly kill. lie, had taken
the same medicine out of the same bottle for
days before. The same prescription had
served for weeks, if not months before. He
was apparently in a cerebral condition that
was rapidly impairing his mind, and it was
associated with a form of skin disease —a bad
case and a repulsive one. Everything points
to some outsider. No suspicion, I suppose,
attaches to his medical adviser?”
“Oh, none, of course.”
“The male he had?”
“No trace of any motive there. The
longer Maxwell lived, the longer his job.”
“A stranger?”
“It might have been —we can’t tell at
present. There is some suspicion—slight.”
“Then the only one, so far as you know,
who had any particular reason to compass
his death was the wife?”
“She did not compass it, didn’t think of
it.”
“John, don’t get nervy. Let us look at
it dispassionately. Tell me what hap-
pence! after I left the court —thanks to
your intervention.”
"I put Douglas Simpson in the box. the
male nurse you referred to. He had been
with Maxwell ever since he was confined
to his room. Maxwell, as you may know,
for certain reasons had a strong objection
to being* nursed by a woman. Simpson had
been a hospital attendant and knew all about
nursing In the witness box he showed
himself’ to be a cool, collected fellow—as
anyone would have inferred from liis im-
passive, expressionless face. Simpson is the
sort of man one can rely on for cold facts,
without imagination to qualify them. He
was a thoroughly good witness and could
not be shaken in cross-examination. lie
swore that on the night of the murder he
was seated in Maxwell’s room; had been
reading to him until the patient dropped
a sleep—probably due to the man’s monoto-
nous voice acting as a sort of soporific.
Simpson switched off the electric reading-
lamp, leaving only one other point to light
the large room. It was, however, quite
sufficient to see by distinctly. He settled
down in an easy chair to take a nap his
patient would not require another dose ol
the medicine for some hours. Scarcely had
he closed his eyes than he was aroused by
a slight noise which suggested the rust le
of a dress. Half-awake, he saw a woman—
a nurse, or a woman he took to be a nurse
bending over the table at the head of the
bedside. She was wearing a cloak the
flowing out-of-door cloak some nurses wear
—and a cap. She stayed there an instant
only and went out without saying a word,
nor did she look at him; consequently, he
had no view of her face. It was all so
quickly done that before he had thoroughly
roused himself she had gone. He went
immediately to the bedroom door, expecting
to see her along the corridor by the light
thrown from the bedroom door, for the
corridor itself was in darkness. He then
walked to the head of the staircase, but saw
no one—heard no one. The business mys-
tified him. He could not conceive why a
nurse should have been called in—especially
at that hour, for it was close on midnight.
As often happens in not too skilful cross-
examination, the fact slipped out that by
some vague association he had linked her
with a woman who had called to see Maxwell
repeatedly, but had been refused au inter-
view.”
“That the woman he saw was a nurse
seems, then, to have been merely conjecture t
“It was the impression he got from her
general appearance—her white and grey cos-
tume, her head-gear and so on. He had no
opportunity of seeing her face."
“Why could it not have been Maxwell s
wife in that disguise?”
“I’ll come to that. I may say that the
whole case against the accused is—with the
exception of a few minor facts circum-
stantial.”
“Well, go on.”
“After Simpson’s cross-examination—in
which he became still more positive that the
woman he saw was a nurse —I put Mrs.
Maxwell’s maid in the witness box. Max-
well's bedroom and his wife’s apartments
are quite separate, occupying different por-
tions of the old-fashioned roomy house. This
dual arrangement has existed since the
child’s death. On this particular night Mrs.
Maxwell had been at a fete ;
a Shakspearean - costume
affair in which she took the
character of Portia —as you
know, she is a tall, rather
stately and a handsome
woman.”
“Yes, I should say she
would fit the part well.”
“As she was returning late
and did not wish to rouse
the household —possibly in-
cluding the sick husband —
the hall door had been shut
to, but not closed. That
point is important, as it
would have been possible for
someone to have entered the
house shortly before she did
and have left it without tin?
knowledge of the inmates.
The maid deposed that ’ she
had been waiting up, cat-
napping, in her own room.
She heard Mrs. Maxwell
come in and immediately
went to her. As she entered
the room her mistress was
throwing off a long fur coat
and was still in her complete
character-costume. The girl
left almost immediately to
boil some water in the kit-
chen —the house is not
modern and hasn’t a liot-
water service. This took a
few minutes, and when she
returned her mistress was
seated, still in her con-
spicuous dress, in a lounge
chair before a radiator. She helped her to
disrobe and then went to bed."
“So there was a sufficient interval in
which Mrs. Maxwell could have visited her
husband’s room and —and, say, have ex-
changed a medicine bottle on the bedside
table for another, or in some way have tam-
pered with its contents?”
“Yes, that is a point the Crown makes
the most of. But no one entered her hus-
band’s room that night, so Simpson swears,
except the nurse he saw. Now. I put it to
you. could he, the self-possessed and very
phlegmatic man I have described, possibly
have mistaken two such different characters
as a nurse and Mrs. Maxwell?”
“Seems very improbable, certainly! What
about this woman to whom you have
referred?”
“No one knows her. It is not inconceiv-
able she was a throw-up from Maxwell's
very dubious past and not so long ago—he
has been married only three to four years.
She may have been a blackmailer, or a
woman who sought revenge. The maid
who attended the door saw her and described
her as about Mrs. Maxwell’s height and
figure. She was not then dressed as a nurse.
As she inquired for Maxwell the maid sent
Simpson to her. Simpson referred to her
as ‘Nellie,’ the only name she gave—she said
Maxwell would know her by that name. She
wanted to see him, but was refused. The
day before his death she called again and
asked if any money had been left for her.”
“How could she know about the lialf-
closed door, or how could she know the oppor-
tune moment? I raise no question about the
nurse's dress; that, probably, would be as
good a disguise as any. But the door and
the time!”
“I confess I can't clear that up is
the only person who could. There is not,
however, a shred of evidence that Mrs.
Maxwell visited her husband's room that
SHE’D GONE PART OF THE WAY.
“There's a wonderful sense of luxury when you lie in bed and
ring for your maid."
“Gee! have you a maid?”
“No, but I have a bell.”
night; on the other hand, there is Simp-
son's unshaken evidence that he saw a
woman there, a nurse.”
“Then the strength of your case rests
on the testimony of Simpson. Might not he
himself have some motive —might there not
be something else beside keeping a job in
his mind? What we don’t know about our
fellow men, John, is far greater than what
we know. Have you unearthed anything at.
all about him?” „ .
“Very little. He told me he emigrated
here about thirty years ago—he is now
somewhere about fifty-—knocked about the
country ; then was for a time a casual hand
in the railways; saved a few T pounds and
tried the land, with the usual result to the
city-bred farmer; drifted back to the city,
got into a hospital in some menial capacity
and eventually became an attendant, wards-
man or something of that kind."
“Intelligent, I suppose?”
“Yes, mentally alert but naturally reticent
and unemotional —one of those chaps with a
flat, liltless sort of voice. Perhaps through
disappointment and brooding over his ill
hick. But a good witness, no faltering, no
uncertainty; what he saw he saw all right.
“The case against your old friend seems
weak—almost wholly inferential.”
“It is. It rests very largely upon the
old classic form of definition by exclusion.
No woman was admitted to Maxwell s room
but his wife, and she only once a day and
always in the morning. This daily visit she
had insisted upon.”
“John, I’d like to see this man Simpson.
There’s an old adage—yon know it- —abmn
still waters running deep. There are motives,
sometimes obscure, but terrible, that move
under the seeming placidity of life.”
“I’ll arrange a meeting at my chambers —
to-morrow morning, if that will suit yon.
I can’t be there myself, but will fix it up
with the clerk to leave you together.” >;
“Thanks. If you hear nothing from nt»
it's because there’s nothing to say. Good
luck, John, to you—and her.”

The soliloquy of Richard Barton Oldfield,
medical practitioner, of advanced years, of
decent repute in his profession, of average
honesty, and seelcing as lest he may to
render unto his fellow men their due. (He
sits ly the fire on a wintry night, alone, in
his study): .
What are the closing days of life but
days of judgment on the years that have
passed! Richard Barton Oldfield. I call you
before me to answer truly “What will you
do?”—you whose years have-nearly reached
the spindle-end. To-morrow an unhappy
woman will face a verdict that will either set
her free or send her to lifelong imprison-
ment. What are you going to do about it
you who know the truth !
Four years ago you were called in to the
bedside of Helen Maxwell, about to bear
her first child. She was young, handsome,
a straightforth woman; as John Forsyth
said “a lovable woman.” You brought her
child into the world the child of a physi-
cally rotten man. It died within a few hours
0 V its birth —and you thanked God for its
death It was her child. Had it been your
daughter’s child by such a man you could
have strangled, the life out of him —you feel
the surge of it even now in your closing
years You never let her see the child,
thou Mi she cried for it —piteously. How
could you let her see it? Then when the
days passed and she rose from her bed you
saw her for the last time. Before you
went you took her hands and made her
vow to you that she would never bear this
man another child. Since then you have seen
her change from the lovable woman into
the woman whose life was one long loathing
—the loathing of the unclean life that had
defiled her motherhood.
Since then, yon
well know, her feet
have trod through
Hell. The barren
years stretched be-
fore her tied to a
man who might
linger on and on till
the corruption of
death claimed him.
You have seen
Douglas Simpson,
and have recalled
him by face and
voice, as a physi-
cian recalls a
deeply interesting
case. You have
sought out dust-
covered records.
It was you who
examined hi m—
very thoroughly, so
say your notes. You
rejected him for
permanent service
in the railways be-
cause to pass him
would have been to
jeopardise life. He
was, so again say
the notes, an ex-
ceptionally marked
ease of color blind-
ness. “Practically
no sense of color at
all,” you wrote.
Richard Oldfield,
what Simpson saw
on the night of the
murder was not a
woman in the greys
and whites of a
nurse’s cap and
flowing gown, but
a woman in the
scarlet robes and
doctor’s cap of
Portia.
What about it,
Doctor Oldfield;
What about this
woman tried in the
furnace of hate and
consumed by its
fire? You are the
one living man who
knows the truth.
What about it?
Will you go into
court to-morrow
and send this vilely
treated woman to
years, if not to a
lifetime, of impris-
onment, or will
yon look it up in tlic srcret self where men
of our calling keep their unwritten records
of human suffering and human frailty?
What! It will cheat Justice! You are
an honorable man ! Yes, yes —you have held
as best you could to honor, truth and mercy
all through life.
Then which is it —your sacrifice or her?
The sacrifice of this woman, cozened of her
right to a clean, untainted child, and linked
to a thing so loathsome —or your bit of
cherished honor?
Tell me truly, truly, man, will you lock
your secret up—hide it for ever?
By God, Dick, yes, you'll lock it up—lock
it up for ever!
* * * *
The jury file into court. At the Bar table
John Forsyth, counsel for the defence, sits
rigidly. ,
The accused is brought m and stands,
then suddenly seats herself and buries her
face in her hands.
“Gentlemen of the jury, have you agreed
upon your verdict? flow say you, do you
find Helen Maxwell guilty or not guilty?”
“Not guilty !”
The. pent emotion of the crowded court
vents itself in a sigh of relief that melts into
the rustle of movement.
T. B. CLEGG.
A STORM.
The Thunder Spirit tossed its head,
The rain came down like wine;
The poet to his darling said
“Beneath the blasted pine
Meet me to-night... .or I am dead.”

Then quoth that lady fine,
“Make it this old damned gum, instead!...
Who wants your blasted pine?”

Virginia Dare.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
[Virginia Dare was the first white child born in
America—a short-lived pioneer.]
ELFIN of days with the wild-rose name,
Who sipped as a bird at the beaker of
Time,
You sipped but, and went like the first of the
dawns;
Bewuldered, you set but your foot to the
climb,
And were gone to the gods, Virginia Dare!
Were you a berry, brown and bold,
Or a lily for lifting, slim and pale?
Did you mock at the bluejays, drenched in
sun,
Or droop as an angel strayed might ail,
Virginia Dare, who died at four?
There were Hildas of battle that Markland
bore,
Alruna maids that Vinland nursed,
Ghostly maids of a ghostly land :
Of the live, red West you were cradled
first,
Virginia Dare, who died at four.
Odin-lads of the old ghost land
Passed and were gathered to stranger-
mould,
When Time and Fate to a hiving new
A pledge would give, ’twas a lass of gold,
With the star-fed rune on a lass’s toijgue.
Did not a tremble run through the woods?
Did the wild birds know their sister was
born —
Born of the kin of the eyries’ quest,
Eagle and halcyon, mingled and lorn?
Little and lorn, for you died at four!
Lass-time, rune-time was not yet.
Lass-time, rune-time tarried long.
They shut within your ell-long grave
Your unsung rune, your star-fed song,
Virginia Dare, who died at four!
They shut it fast, they made their moan,
An ell-long grave, so soon forgot.
They turned the text: “A bud was torn
From the drouth and clangor of our lot;
God’s mercy that she died at four!”
So thin and faint the legend ran;
There was no picture of your face,
No lisp of yours for love to keep.
No stick nor stone to tell the place
Where moan was made, Virginia Dare!
Clash and clangor, chaffer, clink—
Yet birds are nesting by the sea,
Bi’ooding low in a halcyon hush.
Lass-time, rune-time comes to be
Out of your West, Virginia Dare!
Where is the star that fed your rune?
“Over a rocky cavern old,
Over a prince amid the kine,
And a mother-maid with the Magian word.
Hid in the coffer of her heart.”
The tremble runs through the woods anew:
Bairn-time, hush-time comes to be.
The Prince of Peace his pennon gives
To the flaming East and the nested sea
That sang your dirge, Virginia Dare!
Seas away be the rune new-born!
The Old shall kindle at the New;
And, live we, sword and horn shall die
At the little open grave of you,
Virginia Dare, who died at four!

SHIPPED the new cook yet, Mister?”
asked Captain Dobspn, looking up
from his log-book.
“Aye, sir,” replied the mate. “He’s in
the galley novr.”
“Let’s hope lie’s better than that last
pudd’n-lieaded Dago! How's he shaping?”
“Can’t tell yet, sir, but he seems smart
enough. Off a man-o’-war, by the cut of his
jib. Name’s Stokes—Jim Stokes.”
“That’s all right. We sail in an hour.
Tug’s coming alongside at five-thirty. Got
everything ready? Stores-list, cargo-mani-
fests, all that?”
“Everything ready, sir.”
Next morning the barquentine stood well
out to sea, under all plain sail, rolling to
an inshore swell. The captain, clad in greasy
sweater and ancient moleskins, strode up
and down the poop, well satisfied with his
breakfast of curry and rice and with the
w r orld in general.
“Good breeze, Mister!” he. vouchsafed to
Hankin, the second mate, who leant on the
leerail gazing at the distant shore.
“A good breeze, sir, yes, and”
“Beggin’ pardon, sir!” suddenly exclaimed
the man at the wheel, “but there’s somethin’
wrong. Look!”
They both turned sharply to see the cause
of the interruption, and stared with astonish-
ment as Mr. Leatherby, the first mate, came
along the main deck shoving a young slip
of a youth before him. His hand-grips on
the neck and trousers were evidently of no
light weight, judging by the sharp twist of
pain which distorted the captive’s yellow-
wdiite face.
“A stowaway, sir !” bawled Mr. Leatherby,
jerking the youth to a standstill as the cap-
tain and Mr. Hankin came to the break of
the poop. “Caught him hiding in the paint-
locker, seasick, mucking up the paintpots!”
“Look out! You’ll break him in halves!”
cried the captain with a glance of pity at
the forlorn figure.
Mr. Leatherby relaxed his hold ever so
slightly. “What am I to do with him, sir?”
he asked.
“Dunno,!” The captain hesitated to pro-
nounce sentence, “Too good a slant of wind
this to whs'te time putting him ashore. Come
up here, you! ’ Let him go, Mr. Leatherby.”
Mr. Leatherby let him~gb, whereupon the
youth immediately lurched to the side of the
ship, luckily to leeward, and resumed the
activities which had caused such disaster to
the paintpots.
“Humph!” grunted the captain. “Not
much good for a sailor, anyway, not on this
short run. Where did he get that madhouse
rig?” Certainly a reasonable question, for
the youth wore a hat pulled over his ears
and neck, scarlet shorts, voluminous dun-
SNAPPED.
“This beach always makes me sad. I lost my best boy here two seasons ago.”
“What! Shark?”
“No — sheila.”
garees reaching to the armpits, and blucher
boots big enough for a six-foot navvy.
“Dunno where be stole the rig, sir, but
I’ll soon cure him of this!” and the mate’s
stony face set stonier yet as he leapt to the
rail and unhitched a couple of bends of
the main-sheet. “Can’t beat a bit of old-
fashioned medicine for fish feedin’.” He
snarled as he hauled the youth back by his
trousers. “Come here, you young scum of
the earth! I’ll learn you to muck up our
paint... .Gawd A’mighty !”
Mr. Leatherby let go and jumped back as
though smitten by an asp, for as the hat
came off in his grip, down fell a mass of nut-
brown curls.
For a moment or two the only sounds
heard on that ship were the hum of the
rigging and the swish of the seas alongside.
“It’s —it’s a girl!” gasped the captain,
gazing with dilated eyes as though a gargoyle
had dropped from aloft.
“It’s a girl!” echoed Mr. Hankin, staring
with much the same expression. “And a
darned pretty one, too!” he added under his
breath as he critically scanned the tattered
suit of yellow overalls and unspeakable knee-
boots he was wearing.
Mr. Leatherby stood thunderstruck, still
grasping the rope’s end and unconsciously
swaying it.
“Hi!” came a loud yell as the new cook
ran up to the group. “Hi! Don’t hit him!
He’s a girl!”
This sudden interference snapped the ten-
sion and provided an immediate excuse for
an outburst of pent-up feelings.
“Wliat the —. —?” began the. captain, but
suddenly remembering that his form of ex-
pression was not exactly that of a lady’s
boudoir, he pulled up short and stood
stupidly staring.
“Ho!” cried Mr. Leatherby, also suffering
severely from linguistic handicaps, but par-
tially recpvering liis mettle. “Ho! So it
takes a blinkin’ son of a sea-cook to tell
us it’s a female, does it?” Mr. Leatherby’s
jaws refused to function for a moment or
two, but eventually he managed to erupt.
“Get back to your monkey-cage, and bury
your face in the slop-tub! Grr!”
Thus requested to retire, the cook left the
deck with precipitation. Meanwhile the
stowaway sobbed heavily and repeatedly and
again rushed to the side of the ship.
The captain, as a rule very slow in dealing
with any unusual happenings except those to
do with seamanship, on this occasion showed
commendable tact in handling the situation.
“That’ll do, you fellows !” he said quietly, as
he nodded dismissal to the others. “I’ll attend
to this affair myself,” and, gently but firmly
placing his hand on the girl’s shoulder, he
led her aft to the cuddy.
* * * *
As eight bells sounded that afternoon,
Mr. Hankin appeared on the poop to relieve
the first mate and take his watch on deck.
Gone were the yellow overalls and unspeak-
able boots; to Mr. Leatherby’s deep disgust
the young man wore a shore-going suit of
navy blue, surmounted by a white collar, the
first, according to the bos’n’s fluent descrip
tion to a fo’c’s’le audience, that had ever
appeared aboard the Annie Lister at sea.
Sir. Leatherby, a bachelor and woman-
hater, whose sea-attire invariably resembled
a cross between a Guy Fawkes effigy and a
Scotch scarecrow, gazed at his companion’s
attire with ill-concealed disdain, as he gave
him the necessary orders. “And don’t for-
get,” he added, striding off with a snort of
indignation, “don’t forget, Mister Lord
Fauntleroy, to powder your nose if any more
dungareed mermaids come aboard!”
I say!’ the totally unabashed Mr.
Hankin called after him, “what’s the Old
Man going to do with it —her, I mean?”
“If you want to know the captain's
arrangements consuming his passengers, Mr.
Hankin,” replied the mate as he disappeared
down the ladder, “you’d better ask him.”
“’Souse me, sir,” said the man at the
wheel, “but I heard the cap’n tell Mr. Leath-
erby as the stowaway was to help the cook
in the galley, so’s he —she —can sorter work
her passage!”
“Er —thanks, Thompson, but”
“Good Lor’, sir, look!” interrupted the
seaman. “Look at the Old Man !”
Mr. Hankin turned quickly, and saw a
scarlet face, freshly shaven, and apparently
poured red-hot into the very high and tight
neck of a once-white tunic, closely buttoned
over loose duck trousers, whose lower folds
rested concertina-wise partly upon a pair of
carpet slippers and partly upon the deck.
The scarlet face smiled, and in doing so
almost cracked, so unused was it to the con-
tortion. “Glad to see you showing respect
to a female, Mister,” said its owner.
“Although that female is only a stowaway.
I've done me best, too ; but seeing I’ve been
a widower these ten years or more, this rig
HIT IT OFF JUST RIGHT.
LOCAL EDITOR (composing birth notice) : “Will this do, sir?—‘To Mr. and Mrs.
Tredinnick a son. Both well.’”

lias got a bit soiled, being stowed away so
long.”
“Yes, sir!” Mr. Hankin agreed. “Ye-yes,
sir.”
“By the way, Mr. Hankin, can you speak
French?” .
“French? Me! No! Why, sir?
“You see, this—er —this poor young lady
can’t talk English. She’s French, and
lonely—amongst strangers. I’d like you to
help.”
“Sorry, sir, but I can’t. Anything else I
can do?” , ,
“Well, yes. You can turn out of that
berth of yours, and let her have it. There’s
a spare bunk in my room. You can sleep
there. You’ll find it comfortable; and, any-
way, we’ll reach port inside a week with
this slant o’ wind.”
“Certainly, sir. May I inquire the youDg
lady’s name, sir, and why she came aboard
like this?”
“Joan. That’s her name. All I can make
out is that she threw up her job in Auckland,
saw in the papers that we were leaving for
Sydney, climbed into that pawnshop rig and
.slipped aboard. She’s got friends in Sydney."
Mr. Hankin scratched his head thought-
fully. “But what about her rig, sir?” he
ventured. “Those trousers! We can’t let
her go about like that!”
The captain didn’t know what to do about
it. “She’s too busy wishing she. was on dry
land just now, but she’ll be all right by
to-morrow. Can you think of any togs she
can put on?” he asked. “H'ark ! She’s getting
up now. I’ll ask her about it.... Hey!
Missy!” The captain lifted the flap of the
skylight and called through the opening.
“Hey, Missy! Whatty voos toggery?”
But no reply came to this lucid and helpful
question. _
“Bust the lingo !” he ejaculated. Missy!
Womany things for ze dressy! Savvy?”
And still there was no reply.
Once more the captain tried. “Blousey and
skirty !” he suggested in his best French.
The only sounds that came from below still
clearly betokened that the person addressed
was taking no interest whatever in her
personal appearance.
“It’s no use, Mr. Hankin,” said the cap-
tain, shaking his head. “She doesn’t under-
stand what I say !” and he paced the poop
uneasily.
Meanwhile Mr. Hankin had been pondering
deeply. “I’ve struck it, sir !” lie announced.
“I’ve got a lady’s fancy dress stowed away
in my sea-chest. I wore it at a ball last
year over in ’Frisco. She could fix it up to
fit herself!”
“Splendid, young man, splendid! But
what about all the flummery stuff—you know,
undergear?”
“I’ll do my best, sir,” Mr. H'ankin made
haste to answer. “I’ve got plenty of singlets
and things like that. I’ll dig ’em all out!”
“Well, go and dig ’em out right away,
and get that room of yours fixed up. I’ll
take the watch for you. Off you go!”
“Thank you, sir !.... Confound the blither-
ing old idiot!”
Mr. Hankin set to work at once. Down
came his collection of photographs from the
wall. It would never do for the poor young
lady to see those pictures of all the girls he
had ever loved. Up came the strip of carpet
from the floor, to be well shaken and revived
with tea-leaves by the ship’s boy. A spare
hand from for’ard scrubbed the planking,
polished the hardwood bed and touched up
the walls with a coat of quick-drying paint.
Hankin himself washed the bedclothes and
hung them out to dry on the fo’c’s’le head. He
also set to work on the scuttle and porthole,
and polished until brass-work and glass shone
like diamonds. Then out of his sea-chest
he hauled forth his flowing finery, and pro-
duced scissors and sewing gadgets for adjust-
ing and fitting.
“Room all clear by to-niglit, sir!” be
reported as he greeted Captain Dobson at
tea-time. “And here’s the rig and sewing-
gear. Will you pass them in to her, sir?”
“Well, I’m dodgasted!” remarked Mr.
Leatherby, as he came out of his cabin and
took his seat at the table. “Well, I’m dod-
gasted !” he repeated, gazing disgustedly at
his two companions and at the clothes they
were wearing.
“It’s a pity you can’t shave that beard
of yours off, Mr. Leatherby,” snapped Cap-
tain Dobson, “and tidy yourself up a bit!”
“Me shave off my beard!” The mate
almost choked as he swallowed a mouthful
of soup.. “Look here!” he exclaimed, open
ing UP his long, straggling whiskers and dis-
playing a red scar which reached from chin
to cheek.
“H’m!” mused the captain. “Perhaps the
beard’s better. War wound?”
“War! No! Broken beer-bottle in Shang-
hai!”

“Well, anyway”—and the captain eyed him
critically—“there’s no reason, is there, why
you should stick to that beastly, sweaty
jersey?”
“Look here. Captain Dobson.” The chief
had put his knife and fork down to make his
answer more emphatic. “Orders is orders,
and come man and boy I’ve obeyed ’em for
nigh on thirty year. But I ain’t a-going
to start frilling myself up at my time o life
for every chit, of a girl who comes sneakin
aboard in boy’s pants an’ gogglin’ at all
hands”
“Here, enough o’ that! Don’t exaggerate,
Mr. Leatherby! If you like to go about in
a rig that would make a Chinese pirate blush,
I”— —
At that moment the cook came in with the
stew.
“I don’t like that cook!” grumbled Cap-
tain Dobson to Mr. Hankin when the man
had gone.
“Neither do I. as a matter of fact.” put in
Mr. Leatherby, the incident on the deck still
rankling. “But the tucker’s good, ain’t it?”
“It’s all right, but lie’s a darned sight
too familiar. Caught him looking hard at
that girl when lie fetched her grub. I had
to chivvy him out!”
The two mates exchanged glances, and Mr.
Hankin slowly winked as lie passed the
butter.
The fine weather held, with a good, plain-
sail breeze. The trip promised to be well-
nigh a record one for speed, for tin' Annie
Lister always enjoyed herself with a follow-
ing wind and her pliable hull responsive
to a chock-a-block cargo of sawn timber.
Nevertheless, to the surprise of all hands,
next morning the captain ordered sail to be
taken in until the barquentine lazed along
under her fore-and-aft sails and topsails only,
with a couple of jibs to steady her steering.
But the bos’n winked to the crew, and
the mates winked at one another, and all
hands understood.
A still greater surprise, however, awaited
them all, save Mr. Hankin, when after break-
fast there emerged from the cuddy a figure
in blue and gold, bespangled with silver
stars and gold lace. The creamy stockings
fitted admirably, and even the shoes, the
property of Toby, the ship’s boy, did not
appear to be extra large. No Spanish
dancing-girl could have rivalled the dainti-
ness of that vision, as the stowaway, appa-
rently quite unconcerned, strolled around the
ship as a queen around her ‘drawing-room.
Truly a pretty sight, the pallor of her oval
face contrasting sharply with the startling
colors of her attire, and the flash of her
large brown eyes lighting up the whole
outfit as gems light up a crown! Even Mr.
Leatherby stared in amazement and unwit-
tingly buttoned up his gaping jersey, while
the man at the wheel narrowly escaped
letting the ship come up into the wind.
“Mind your steering!” snarled Mr.
Leatherby.
Captain Dobson’s face appeared at the
cuddy scuttle, which looked upon the main
deck, and remained there for some time,
his eyes transfixed. Presently he appeared on
the poop, clad in all his semi-white glory.
“Hey, Missy!” he beckoned. “Don’t
wander about there! Something might fall
on your head! Come aft here! Oh, damn
the lingo!”
The girl pouted, hesitated, then smiled
entrancingly and slowly walked aft and
laboriously climbed the ladder to the poop.
Mr. Hankin, in navy blue, appeared from
the companion-way. He stood on the top
step, gazing almost with awe upon the bril-
liant results of the triumph.
“Why ain’t you asleep, young man?”
snapped Mr. Leatherby, glaring at him with
repugnance.
“It’s very stuffy down below!” Mr.
Hankin replied feebly, straightening his tie.
“H’m ! Seems to me it’s safer below than
it is up here!” and the mate’s mouthful of
nicotine was added to the broad Pacific.
“Come here—here—Mammy-zell Joan !”
Captain Dobson wheedled. “Shifty voos over
here!” he added, shrugging his shoulders
and gesticulating in the orthodox French
manner. “Runny over here!” and ho indi-
cated that he desired the young lady’s com-
pany at the stern of the vessel. “I teach
yon ze talkee ze English, eh?”
Joan tripped towards him smiling gaily.
“Engleesh ?” she lisped.
“Yes! Wee! See —taffrail!” and he
splodged his hand up and down on the rail.
“Taffrail!” he repeated.
“Taffy-ray?” said the lady.
“Good ! Now —captain !” and he thumped
his chest.
“Goo —now —capitaine?” And the lady
plucked the lace on her blouse.
“Ow!” bawled Mr. Leatherby, scarlet with
the strain of controlling himself. “Ow!
I’ll bust!” and he lurched off to the for’ard
end of the poop and steadfastly gazed aloft.
“My hat!” exclaimed Mr. Hankin with an
expression of nausea as he disappeared
below.
Having reached the room he shared with
Captain Dobson, Mr. Hankin carefully closed
the door and locked it. He sighed heavily
as he dragged his chest from under the bunk,
and sighed again as from its miscellaneous
contents he selected a leather-bound volume,
an. anthology of verse, inscribed, “To Hum-
phrey P. Hankin, a record for good attend-
ance, Forth Hampshire Public School.”
Taking pen and paper, he eagerly searched
for a guide to inspiration as he ran his
fingers down the index of poems avowing
Cupid as the dominating theme. Then he
wrote, and rewrote, and crossed out and
wrote again.
As Captain Dobson turned in that night,
leaving the second mate in charge on deck,
he picked up Mr. IJankin’s anthology of
verse, which he found on its owner’s pillow,
and began to read. He became interested,
absorbed, engrossed. “Ah!” he sighed every
now and again. “Ah! If only I could put
it like that?”
Far into the night Captain Dobson read
those poems of love. Restless was his sleep
when at last he closed his eyes, and dis-
turbed were his dreams. Early morning
found him at his table in the cuddy, labor-
ing heavily with a pen, and littering the
floor with torn-up bits of paper as he dis-
carded his efforts and began to write again.
The cook found a much-smudged sheet of
paper when he came in to set the table for
breakfast, and, reading it as in duty bound,
discovered: —
OUR NEST.
All Joan ! Oh Joan! Ah Joan !
I moan ! I groan ! I moan.
To make you my own, my own,
When o’er the billows we’ll roam
Through waves and dashing foam,
Till we find a farm of loam
And build a nest —our Home Sweet Home—
Ah Joan!
The cook chuckled callously as lie shoved
it deep into his trousers pocket.
That evening, Mr. Hankin, long-faced and
hollow-eyed, tapped gently at the door of his
own private room.
A little cry came from within and showed
that its temporary owner was at home.
“Joan!” he whispered hoarsely through
tin' keyhole. “Open the door, my dear —er,
mon Chair!”
“Pardon f”
“The door—the porte! Ouvrir the bloom-
ing porte!”
The door opened, an inch or two, gingerly.
“I had to write this for you— to you,
Joan!” he whispered as he passed in a
neatly-folded note. “It’s a poem—oh, hang
the lingo!—le or la poesie pour voo, Joan !
Jo voo love. I lovey voo like the very devil,
Joan!”
“Eh?”
“I lofe you, Joan. In English and French
I say it!’ I can’t keep quiet any longer.
“Oh! You, too? For Heaven’s sake stow
that humbug, Mr. Hankin! Surely the cap-
tain's enough.”
“Wha-wha-ia/m#/ Then you can speak
English?”
“Of course I can! Haven’t you tumbled
yet? I thought we might be pals, you and
THE TROUBLES OF YOUTH.
DISGUSTED BOBBY: “You been cross with me for growing out of my clothes, and now
you go and get a baby girl that they’re no use to.”
1, as man to man, when I first saw you,
but”
“Man to man! Then—by gosh ! Holy
snakes ! You’re a boy, after all!”
“Oh. you’re a clever lot of boobies, you
seamen! A baby could bluff a shipload!
Do curls make a girl? Is a chap a female
because he has a slim waist and gets sea-
sick? But, I say, Mr. Hankin, for Heaven’s
sake don’t give me away! If you do —I’ve
got this precious poem of yours, and I’ll send
it to every newspaper in Sydney if you say
a word!”
“Oh, shut your mouth, damn you! I’ve
a good mind to put you across my knee, and
—I say!” A sudden light came into his
eyes. “I say, what a lark! You a boy, and
the skipper ! Ho ! Ho ! Ho ! My sacred
aunt! What a lark!” He doubled up with
laughter.
A footstep sounded.
“Eh ! Beg pardon, sir?” and with a jerk
lie straightened himself as Captain Dobson
appeared in the narrow alleyway ferociously
asking, “What the devil?” ——
“It’s all right, sir! I’m not dotty! Just
laughing at the thought of that scar on Mr.
Leathcrby’s face, sir, and how he’d look if
he shaved ! Ho ! Ho ! Ho !” and off he went,
chuckling at his escape.
He had not retreated very far before he
heard the captain’s knuckles tapping gently
at the door he had just left.
The following Sunday, while pacing the
deck in his afternoon watch, Mr. Hankin
heard voices whispering in the cuddy. Guess-
ing what was afoot, he glanced through the
open scuttle. The captain had that ponder-
ous tome, Burke’s “Navigation,” spread open
on the table before him, and beside him sat
the stowaway, solemnly receiving the daily
lessons in English.
“Sextant!” announced the captain, putting
his finger on a diagram of that instrument.
“Sexy-tanty?” came a lisped imitation
“Latitood!” and the captain pointed to
the word.
“Latty-too?” lightly responded his pupil,
stifling a yawn.
Mr. Hankin heard a step behind him.
That confounded cook again ! He hated the
leer that seemed to live on the greasy
bounder’s face. “A face like a shark’s liver!”
as Mr. Leatherby had only that morning
described it. “Like the beak of a bilious octo-
pus !” the captain had contributed.
Mr. Hankin flushed slightly as he at
once withdrew from the scuttle. Did that
cook wink, ever so slightly? Was he, too,
in the joke about that stowaway boy.
Tali! Why bother, anyway, about such
confounded galley-slush ?
At that moment the very distinct sound
of a slap came from within. Mr. Hankin
grinned from ear to ear. He couldn’t help
it, and as he turned away he fancied he saw
a grin on the face of the cook also.
* * * *
“Alongside the wharf to-night!” prophesied
Mr. Leatherby early next morning. “I’ve
never known a calmer trip!”
“We’d have been alongside long ago,” com-
mented Mr. Hankin, “but for shortening sail
like that! Cuss the old man and his darna-
tion foolery! An old fool is the worst fool
of all!” he added, disgustedly.
“That's right! And I’m glad to see you’ve
knocked off being a fool yourself, young man!
The togs you’re wearing suit you a long
way better’n those blue things”
“Pah! What does it matter?”
and that white collar !”
“Very well, Mr. Leatherby—but you
needn’t rub it in! What’s the captain going
to do with his precious stowaway when we
make port, eh?”
“I dunno, but I guess he won’t hand her
over to the police, like he oughter!”
Mr. Hankin stared at him in surprise.
“Do you mean to say that you haven’t
tumbled yet, Mr. Leatherby?”
“Tumbled? Of course I have. He'll marry
tin' wench right away in a registry-office,
I suppose, and we’ll be perlooted with a
female everlastingly aboard.”
“Mr. Leatherby!” bawled the captain from
below, and the mate hastened away to get
his harbor orders.
The tug promptly answered the signals,
and as evening fell the Annie Lister, her can-
vas neatly brailed up, rippled behind the
steamer towards her allotted berth.
The usual bustle and excitement ensued in
warping alongside and in making fast the
shore-lines to the bollards on the wharf. No
sooner was the ship securely moored than
the agents came aboard, fo’c’s’le visitors
lounged across the decks, and idlers prowled
about, until ordered over the side by the
wrathful Mr. Leatherby.
Captain Dobson signed the last of .the
agent’s papers, and heaved a sigh of relief as
the second mate reported “All c-lear, sir !*’
“And now, Mister,” he said, folding up
his copy of the manifest and stowing it
among the ship’s papers, “let us have a cup
of coffee and a bite to eat. Shake up that
rascally cook —what’s his name—Stokes—
will you?”
“Right oh, sir!” And Mr. Hankin turned
to obey.
“Where’s that cook?” Mr. Leatherby met
him at the door. “Can’t find the cook, sir!”
he reported' to his chief. “Thought he might
be in here!”
“Here? No! Confound the liver-faced
mongrel! Perhaps he’s giving Miss—er—-
Miss Joan some grub. Who’s that? Come
in!”
A shore messenger anpeared, and handed
in a letter. “For Captain Dobson,” lie an-
nounced, and darted off again. Irritably the
captain tore open the envelope.
Late that night Mr. Hankin retired to
his berth in the captain’s cabin. As he
lighted the lamp he noticed that he was
alone in the room. “H’m!” he remarked.
“Old man still ashore, eh! Bought the ring.
I’ll bet, and drunk by now on beer and
love!” And he indulged in a chuckle of
delight. “I’ll keep well out of range when
I tell him it’s only a confounded boy! Care-
less old ass!” he added picking up a large
sheet of paper from the bedside locker.
“Leaving his papers about like this. I won-
der if it’s important?” And he read, written
in neat scholarly handwriting: —
Dear Captain Dobson, —Thank you so much for all
your kindness. My husband and I thought it best to
hurry away as soon as we could, lie is Jim Stokes,
the cook, you know. You see, we were married in
Auckland about a month ago, and wanted to come to
Sydney, but had no money to pay our passage.
Please send Jim his wages. His address is G.P.0.,
Sydney. Thank you for the pretty verses called
“Our Nest.” Jim gave them to me last Wednesday.
He says that when he receives his wages he will
write the receipt at the foot of the verses and send
them back to you. I am sorry, because so many of
my friends would love to hear about “Our Nest.
Please thank Mr. Hankin for me and tell him
I’ll send his pretty clothes back by post. He was
very kind, and he speaks so nicely, but tell him his
knowledge of gender is very poor. (>
As I won’t see you again, I’ll say “Good-bye
my dear Captain.—Yours faithfully, Joan Stokes.
P.S. —I can say taffrail quite easily now.
P.P.S. —Also latitude.
Calmly, grimly, Mr. Hankin put the paper
back again, doused the light and went to
his own cabin.
The first thing he did next morning was
to replace those photographs of the only
girls he had ever loved.
H. T. GIBSON.
Eggshells.
[FOR THE BULLETIN. ]
Mary Campbell wound the legrope
round the strainer-post and the broken
gate of the calf pen, and from the peg
over the cow bail lifted down the half-kero-
sene-can from which she had just fed the
fowls and which was now full of eggs. She
leaned for a minute or two on the rail
of the cowyard, for she had been very busy
with the stock during the last hour and was
feeling tired. Turning her head a little
she looked back towards the warm glow of
the winter sunset, and, as lonely country
women do, spoke aloud:
“He won’t go, so it don’t ardly seem
worth Ms goin’. But it’s like the end er
things, like makin’ yer will.”
She moved away from the rail, and, walk-
ing towards the stable, halted and stood
looking in over the low door at the horses
she had brought up from the lucerne pad-
dock half an hour ago.
“Spring don’t ’ardly look
fit fer twenty mile neither,”
she said controversially, and
leaned on the stable door as
if she wished that the horses
might take the affirmative
and quench her wavering
negatives.
“Oh, well,” she said,
speaking this time to the
fading line on the horizon,
“I’ll have the bath, any-
way.”
With this definite object
in view she quickened her
footsteps towards the grey
slab house outside, where
two blackened kerosene-tins
full of steaming water stood
among a heap of glowing
embers.
The sound of her splash-
ing awakened the two little
boys who had been put to
sleep in the inner room, and
they asked to get up; so,
having reclotlied herself, she
took the little ones, un-
dressed and popped them to-
gether into the warm water,
where thev were well lath-
ered and rinsed and then
dried on the family towel.
It was five o’clock and
dark before the other three
arrived from school, and she
heard Dolly’s hoofbeats a
great way off.
Before she could distin-
guish the sound of the child-
ren’s voices, she had added
half the second bucket of
water to that already in the
tub, lit the lamp and the
hurricane-lantern, which she
swung as a welcome outside
the kitchen door, spread tlie cloth on the
table and cut the. loaf into slices.
Amy and Diamond came hurrying in,
while Gainey took the pony down to the
dam for a drink before feeding and rugging
him for the night.
“Oh, mum,” Diamond exclaimed, “you’ve
got to come. Rube told Sid Skeen to tell us
that they wanted you there pertickler. She
says there’s a reason, only she’s swore not
to‘ tell.”
“If Rube’s so anxious she oughter send
me word if your father’d be there. Now,
’member your ears and the back er yer neck,
and don’t be too long,”-she ordered as the
hastily disrobed child stepped into the bath.
Then the eldest boy came in and hung his
bridle upon the peg behind the kitchen door
and let the sheepskin saddle fall to the floor.
“Now, Garney, keep yer eyes to yerself,”
his mother snapped, adding, “though we’re
all as God made us. dear knows, and nothing
to be ashamed of.”
“Aw, go hon,” said Garney. “Did yer keep
some water hot for me? By the time five
of yous goes through, it’s cold as liice.”
He sat down to the table.
“Wash yer ’ands,” commanded Mrs.
Campbell.
“Aw, go hon,” responded Garney; “ain’t
I goin’ to ’ave a bath soon's I'm done?
Mum, there’s a lady called Cowell stayin’
at the station, and she’s makin’ sausige rolls
fer the dance.”
Mrs. Campbell listened attentively.
Garney always brought her these little bits
of news from the outside world. He was
the only one who seemed to realise how
lonely she was, how cut off. Not for worlds
would she have admitted to any favorite
in the family, but now and again she found
herself telling Garney things.
“I don’t know about going. Garney! I
don’t think yer father’ll be there. Get out,
Amy, and let Diamond get in. Don’t wet
yer *’air—’ere’s an ’airpin.”
“ ’E’ll be there all right,” said Garney,
his mouth full of bread and treacle. “Yer
used that much soap last time, Di’mond,
when I come out I was stingun’.”
Mrs. Campbell arranged the knife so that
the treacle might drip back off it into tin

tin. “I s’pose you’ve no news of him?
Ain’t none of the school got fathers down
sleeper-cutting?”
Unwilling to admit either the fruitlessness
of his quest or raise hopes later to be
dashed, Garney filled in the awkward gap
by munching noisily; then, rising from the
table, he began to undo the knots in his
boots.
Half an hour later when they were all
ready to depart, Amethyst exclaimed : “Mum!
You haven’t got yer necklace on!”
Mrs. Campbell hesitated a moment; then
she mounted a chair, and from a cretonne-
hung shelf she lifted down a dusty teapot,
and from its depths withdrew a silver chain
from which was suspended a really fine opal.
“They say they’re unlucky,” she said,
“and I’m almost minded to leave it home.
God knows I’ve ’ad my share o’ bad luck
ever since I first wore this thirty year ago. A
man dad knew from White Cliffs giv’ it to
him, and he ’ad it put on the chain fer me.
I was that pleased with it I said to dad:
‘Boy or girl, we’ll call our first Hopal.’
An’ we did—-but ’e died.”
The excitement of preparing for the dance,
after her long mood of despondency, loosed
the woman’s usually silent tongue. She still
stood on the chair, fastening the chain
about her neck, and addressed the little audi-
ence gathered about her.
“Dad tried to cheer me up. There’ll be
plenty more, he said, and we’ll call ’em all
after jewels, and each time I’ll give you their
name-stone to ’ang on the chain. But there’s
twelve of yous now, and I’ve never ’ad no
jewels.”
She stepped down from the chair and then
added: “It came through me calling the
next Ruby, not knowin’ they wus terrible
expensive, and that year things wus only
middlin’. But next year we cut the herbage
in the top paddick for hay, and dad was
that pleased when he come in to see me in
bed with the noo baby he ’ad ’is ’ands full
o’ the flowers and ’e says: ‘They smell real
nice, Mum—l guess we’ll call this girl
Clover.’ But thinkin’ of the necklace and
two stones owin’ to me I says: ‘No, we’ll
call ’er Pearl, same as arranged.’ But I
never got no pearl.”
Then, as she re-tied the long veil round
her hat in a desperate effort to escape from
the gloom that she had cast about them,
she said: “He rid over fifty mile to give
me the Hopal.” But the depression was
too heavy, and at once again overwhelmed
her. “I doubt,” she said, “if he’ll ride
fifteen to see us to-night.”
Nevertheless, a few minutes later they
w’ere all off to the dance, Mrs. Campbell
riding on the side-saddle which, it was said,
her mother-in-law had used to ride to her
own wedding sixty-five years ago. She held
the youngest, a little red-headed tellow like
Garney, in her arms; the other four, strad-
dling over the sheepskin on the draught mare,
rode beside her away down the track
and into the darkness. Mile upon mile they
rode, speaking seldom. Sometimes the mother
bade them beware lest little Onyx should
fall asleep and tumble off, and now and
again Garney switched the lazy old draught
to a smarter pace, and finding himself
abreast of his mother, gave her the odd
gleanings of his news of the day. Spicer’s
cow had jumped a five-barred gate and gone
to the river, where her other calves had all
been dropped. Scrymgers were busy cutting
lucerne and pitting it for ensilage. German
Charlie was workin’ for ’em again.
Sometimes he asked a question. For
example: “What makes rabbits’ eyes shine
in the dark, Mum?”
And, then, did she believe that about
stars bein’ worlds?... .and (very near his
heart, this) exactly what was a sausige-roll?
They were within half a mile of the Bend
when Diamond cried: “I can hear a fiddle!
That’ll be Mr. Ashton. He was with the
sleeper-cutters, so dad’ll be there!”
Mary Campbell was warmly greeted on
all sides. The sleeping baby was lifted from
her arms, while the children slid gratefully
down from the wide-backed mare and began
to rub their stiffened limbs and warm their
bands at the big fire over which hung
fountains of water for tea- and coffee-making.
Then they were all bustled inside, where
Coral, now maid at the station, as Mary
had been, came forward to greet her mother.
Mary was totally unprepared for the
change in her daughter; the slip of a girl
who six months ago had looked too young
to go out to service had blossomed into a
beautiful young woman. With a mixture
of pride and shyness, Mary extended a hand
in greeting as to a stranger; but Coral’s edu-
cation had been improving rapidly since she
had come to the station, and she laughingly
threw her arms about the shy, brown-faced
woman and kissed her. Still more embar-
rassed, Mary said: “They feed yous well,”
a remark intended to convey a compliment
upon Coral’s rosy complexion, rounded figure
and general improvement.
The girl indicated Carew, who was coming
towards them ; “Here’s the boss! The lady
with him is staying with us and wants to
meet you.”
Carew said: “Mrs. Cowell, this is my old
nurse. Mary, this is Mrs. Cowell —do you
remember a boy named Cowell who spent
holidays with us in the old days? We’ve
been telling Mrs. Cowell about your dancing
and how you bring those kids of yours along
on horseback.”
“I hear you’ve won every contest ever held
in the Bend,” said the lady graciously. “L
hope you win to-night.”
A shadow passed over Mary’s face. > “l
don’t know as I’ll be entering. Ned didn’t
’appen to come along, did ’e, Mr. Bruce?”
“No-o-o,” said Carew, glancing at the
open doorway. “But plenty of time, Mary.
I hear that their gang are pretty deep in
the timber. Martin talks of charging the
company an extra threepence a log on their
load, fie bogged twice coming out last week.
Well, you and I are to open the ball, Mrs.
Cowell, and there's the music.”
Music! A piano hopelessly out of tune,
a violin that should have made any cat
blush for its ancestors, and a concertina
that —well, at least it had good intentions.
Anyway, the time was perfect; and soon
the dancers, the hurricane-lanterns throwing
dark shadows on the floor, even the gum-
bushes that were doing their utmost to hide
the nakedness of the corrugated-iron walls,
were swaying in unison.
Dancing feet were quite satisfied: all
they wanted, time and rhythm, were there.
At the far end of the hall two wire
stretchers were drawn sideways on and
hedged with wire-netting decorated with
paper roses. It made a bed for 10 sleeping
babies. The floor shone like glass, and a
young jackeroo was bringing withering con-
tempt upon himself by trying to balance a
cigarette paper on his nose. They were
not there for gymnastics, but to dance, and
they danced decorously, beautifully—
mazurkas, quadrilles, alberts.
“Yer girl dances as well as you used to,
Mary,” said old Bob Thompson, stumping
carefully over the slippery floor on liis
wooden leg, and laying a hand on friendly
shoulders as he passed.
Garney with three chosen souls sat near
the door and ate peanuts; his sister, dancing
with a weedy young selector from Gulgong,
stopped to speak to him.
“Garney, you and me’s dancing in the
competition,” she said.
Coral would have been vastly flattered had
she but guessed how her newly-acquired
prettiness was embarrassing her young
brother.
“Aw! Go lion!” he said, not looking at
her and cramming his mouth full of pea-
nuts. “I’m dancin’ the competition wif
Mum! Charlie Cross wanted ter, but she
says she’d rather me.”
“But if Dad comes?” insisted Coral.
“Oh, hall right!” said Garney loftily,
tossing peanut shells out of the doorway.
“Why won’t you dance it. with me?”
asked the weedy youth as he whirled her
away.
SUGGESTED IMPROVEMENTS.
YANK BANDSMAN: “Say, Peter, what about makin' it feel a bit homey and handin’
round, a few saxophones?”
Coral shot him a tantalising glance, a
mixture of tenderness and refusal. “Any
other dance. But, you see, Mum taught
Garney and me to dance.”
“Your mother’s won nearly every year,
hasn’t she?”
“Nearly? Mum’s never been beat in her life.”
“Well.” said the boy, still stinging a little
under her refusal, “she’d better look out
to-night. There’s a couple coming from
Mudgee and they reckon they’ve never been
beat, even in England! Look, here they are!”
The women of the Bend wore their Sunday
frocks to dances- —modest, high-necked and
long-sleeved gowns of which Father Hen-
nessey would not disapprove for church-
going. Rut the girl who had just entered
was wrapped in a scarlet velvet cloak, be-
neath which there gleamed a white satin,
diamond-besprinkled creation; the like of
it many of the Bend women had never
seen. Her pretty legs were in white silk
stockings, and diamonds decorated her white
satin shoes. She stood with her husband,
looking like a lost fairy in the shadowy hall.
Then, drawing her cloak about her, with
her husband she walked over and sat on
one of the benches near the wall. Every
eye in the room was upon her; some of
tiie children drew nearer “to get a good
look.” She was amused, but embarrassed,
and was relieved when the M.C. stood up
and made liis usual facetious announce-
ment; “There will be a ten minutes’ inter-
val to allow the rabbiters to go round their
traps.”
The announcement was greeted with a
sort of sheepish alacrity by the men, and,
judging by the broad stream pouring out
of the doorway, the whole male population
of the Bend ivas interested in rabbiting. The
wives looked after the retreating figures
with tolerant disdain, knowing full well it
was merely the first of probably too many
visits to the beer barrel. But the dancers
from Mudgee had taken the joke literally and
were rocking with mirth.
By this time it had been conveyed to
Mary .Campbell that these people had come
to Win her prize, and her heart sank. The
psychological effect of the diamond-studded
slippers was too great. She dared not glance
down at her own broad, laced shoe. She
was almost glad that Ned had not come
and she could with reasonable excuse refuse
to “stand up.”
Now the interval was over. There was
a tramp of feet, and in front of the return-
ing men, Carew's arm flung across his shoul-
der as if he had just captured him, was
her own great brown-bearded husband!
From all parts of the hall came the soft
clapping of women’s hands, and bright nods
and smiles were flung to Mary; but she saw
none of them —only the tall man and the
boss bringing him to her !
She stood up very quiet and dignified,
extending her hand, gloved in black cotton, to
her husband ; and before there was time to
say anything, Carew had stepped into the
middle of the room and was announcing the
competition and. inviting the competitors to
send up their shoes for the egg-shells.
“What on earth ?” asked the little
diamond lady of her husband; and Carew,
catching her puzzled frown, stepped back
on to the dancing floor.
“As there are possibly competitors new
to the district, it may be as well to explain,”
he said, “that the Bend holds to its time-
honored custom of affixing eggshells to the
heels of the lady-competitors’ shoes. Fifty
points arc awarded out of the possible hun-
dred for unbroken eggshells—twenty-five for
each heel. After that, all things being-
equal, for the best and most graceful dancer. ’
Then the M.C. took the shoes, and gummed
the shells into position.
Strange, soft music was filling the hall.
At Carew’s suggestion, Mrs. Cowell was to
play the competition waltz, and she played
very well. • It was the old “Blue Danube,”
and Mary’s heart gave a throb; for the
music was not only an inspiration, it was
a memory, and her feet in the old Deed
shoes began to move as if they were winged.
There were four couples in the competi-
tion —less than usual, since interest in the
dancers outran the desire to compete for
the prize. For Mary there was but one
serious antagonist in the room.
The Ashtons were now gravely dancing
round, and Mary wondered how long it
would be before they began to scold each
other for minor mishaps. There, they were
beginning now! Jenny had insisted upon
dancing with her silk shawl on. The scrubby
fringe was tickling the back of her hus-
band’s hand, and he was saying, “Pull it
up!. What did yer want ter wear the
thing for?”
They always quarrelled—and. of course,
you could not dance well and quarrel.
“Reverse!” came from the M.C. Three
couples obeyed like soldiers; but the Mudgee
couple were unprepared for orders and took
a second or so to comprehend. Then they
began to giggle. But they still danced beau-
tifully, nevertheless.
“Running waltz !”
This time they were better prepared, and
the four couples drove their line straight
from one end of the hall to the other. But
there catastrophe awaited the Ashtons.
Harry’s surreptitious clutching at the
irritating fringe had loosened the shawl from
its moorings. Fluttering low, its threads
caught the rough end of Bob Thompson’s
wooden leg. Next instant first one tnen
the other eggshell crashed, and amid a good
deal of hardly-suppressed laughter the couple
sat down to have their row in comfort.
Now there were only three couples on
the floor.
“Fancy quarrelling!” thought Mary
dreamily. She and Ned had never done
that. But, then, Nod never quarrelled with
anyone, he was that easy goin’. That s
why he had never got on. There had only
ever been one scene. That was when —when
she had rebelled against thirty years of
child-bearing and drudgery. And even then
his only reply had been; “Well, there s good
money in sleeper-Cuttin’. I’ll try that.” And
he had gone off and left her. Of course he
had sent her money. There was quite a wad
of notes folded in the teapot with the spout
off on top of the cretonne-covered shelf; but
no word had passed between them. And
now he had come to dance with her !
She wondered if they had sent for him.
If Ruby and her husband had perhaps driven
down and begged him to come? Or if Bruce
Carew had taken a hand? All day she
had been wishing that they would do some-
thing, and now she was longing to hear that
he had just come himself!
This beautiful music! Something was
crying inwardly to her. And they had not
spoken, not a word. Only when they stood
up for the dance. Ruby, over-anxious, had
hurried to her side and said: “Take off
the opal, Mum —opals are unlucky!” And
she had raised her eyes to her husband to
see what he thought about it. And he
had slowly shaken his head, looking down
at the little jewel; and suddenly she knew
a great many things. Knew that he had
not forgotten the little baby who died. Knew
that somehow he was sorry he had not
been able to hang those other jewels on the
chain. And she knew that she did not want
jewels. She realised in a flash why she
had gone on naming the children as she had
done—it bad been merely that she
might each time register a fresh grudge
against him. In the same flash she realised
that she had missed the real things he
had been ready to give her. and that her
terrible loneliness had been
something she had herself
induced.
Thirty years—a long way
to look back! She could
feel the warmth of his hand,
and there was a strange
throbbing in her that was
not entirely due to the
music.
“German waltz!” came
the order, and wide flew the
dancers, like skaters over
the ice—advance six steps,
retreat, and together again
in each other’s arms.
A burst of laughter from
feel the warmth of his hand
the somewhat unsympathetic
watchers round the walls
aroused Mary to look at the
scene about her, and for a
brief second a triumphant
little smile curled a corner
of her mouth. The diamond
lady and her partner were
standing openly amazed at
this long-forgotten figure of
the waltz. They pluckily
essayed a very creditable
attempt at it, but the hus-
band shook his head, and,
laughing, they sat down.
And now there were only
the two children and her-
self and Ned on the floor;
and for a minute Mary
danced serenely, secure in
knowledge that victory was
hers.
Soon something of the in-
tense interest in the room was conveyed
to her, and realisation sent the blood
rushing and singing to her head. Coral,
her own daughter, was her real oppo-
nent ! Coral, so young, so graceful and
pretty; and Garney, who could dance so per-
fectly when he chose.
“Coral looks well!”
They were her husband’s first words to
her, and coming first they cut into her
fearful heart like a knife.
“She's like you— wus.”
The wail in the music told her that this
•was the end. Just when she would have
almost given her life for a final success,
for one last triumph, when she and her man
could stand together and bow to the clapping
audience, and everyone would come forward
with congratulations, and she would look for
and catch that quick glance of pride in her
husband’s eye! Under cover of such excite-
ment she longed to say. “Come home, Ned —
we want you home!” And she wanted
—how she wanted! —to give him the wad of
notes from the teapot and tell him that
she didn’t want jewels for her chain, but
liked to have him sitting with her before
the fire when the children were all in bed.
Going, going was all that dream !
She must stand aside and know that he
was glad to see his daughter win! He
had looked at her and seen she was just an
ugly old woman, well past her prime; and
how could she, in that moment of humilia-
tion, turn and ask him to come home?
In her misery she forgot the dance, for-
got the egg-shells. She leaned a little too
much towards him as if, failing all, she
must hold him with her hands: and then
one heel touched and she knew the shell
was crushed!
* * * *
It was at that moment that Coral whis-
pered to Garney:
“I’m winning ! I seen Mum’s heel touch!
I seen it and I know both my shells isn’t.”
Garney put his a little more firmly
around her waist, and with a jerk brought
her both heels flat on the floor.
“They’re crushed now all right!” he said
cheerfully; and as the bell rang for the
dance to end. he dived down into the bottom
of his trouser pocket and handed her his
last peanut as a peace-offering.

ESTERDAY a land of explorers—to-day
1 a nation large in the eyes of the
world. Yesterday a land of importations—
to-day a country rich in home production.
And leading in this inspiring march of
progress, one product proved by national
acceptance —OLD COURT WHISKY. Its
history one of romance—its victory over
importations a tribute to the quality of a
great Australian product.
Quality, more than patriotism, has put
it in its present position, that of the
World’s Purest and the Nation’s Favorite.

[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
BOWLS.—A RINK-SIDE STUDY.
THE Todds had just finished their Sun-
day tea when Mrs. Todd pushed back
her plate and sent out a challenge to
Mr. Ross, who had happened along when
she was “laying the table.” That was one
of his habits since he had been out of work.
Another habit was not to be too strenuous
about seeking work. Mrs. Todd’s challenge
had something to do with both.
“They say the Bureau can get any man
work,” she said, fixing him with her master-
ful eyes.
His search for fragments in a hollow tooth
was prolonged, and, emphasising her words
with forceful movements of her hand, she
repeated: “Any kind of work.”
The search ended abruptly as his laboring
brain conceived the reply: “Not my kind.”
Mrs. Todd sniffed. "Your kind? What’s
that, I’d like to know?”
Once more he appealed to any cerebral
convolutions he might possess, but all that
resulted was a feeble reiteration of his first
remark; whereupon Mrs. Todd sat up in
a way that roused her husband from the
torpor produced by a good meal.
“Ted’s a plasterer by trade, Maria,” he
ventured.
Her “Plasterer!” was a snort; and ignor-
ing the fact that both men had risen from
their chairs, she launched a virile speech
on the evils of indolence, the creation of
unemployables by unemployment and other
things which she had learned at meetings
convened by people who didn’t have to work.
She had a good memory, and her husband
had shifted the weight of his body from
left foot to right and back again to left
before she turned to him and said : “An’ you
know what I say’s true, spite of your red-
flag notions.”
Giving Mr. Ross the sign that now was
the time to escape, and turning towards the
door, Todd covered the retreat of his friend
with two words: “May be.”
After they had reached the sanctuary of
the shed at the bottom of the yard and
lighted their pipes. Mr. Ross nodded his head
towards the kitchen, whence came sounds of
vigorous washing-up, and, speaking past the
stem of his pipe, spoke confidentially.
“Pretty strong, eh?”
Todd agreed without speaking; and pre-
sently the soft voice came again: “Why
don’t y’ stand up to ’er. Bob?”
Taking his pipe from his mouth, Todd
expectorated through the doorway and said :
“You wouldn’t.”
For a minute or two all that attempted
to vie with the distant noise of washing-up
was the appreciative sound made by Mr.
Ross’s lips with every smoky exhalation.
But presently Mrs. Todd’s remarks to the
cat inspired a supplementary question.
“Why did you marry ’er?”
Todd knocked the ashes out of his pipe
and put it on the bench beside him. Then,
looking out of the door towards a wattle-
tree that was just beginning to reveal its
wealth, he answered :
“Well, she was cook at the place where
I was gardener. Bin with the family for
years. Swells they were. That’s where she
got ’or politics from.”
Mr. Ross nodded his head and waited.
“A good cook she was, an’ somehow I
never could take the lead, an’ she could.”
He let that sink into Mr. Ross’s convolu-
tions. Then, motioning towards the house,
he went on:
“She bought that, anyhow, even if I did
earn the money. We never would've ’ad it
but for her.”
They were silent for a time, and now
that the washing-up was over and the cat
had taken refuge in the s h e d, a Sabbath
calm blessed the tender gold of the wattle-
tree Todd’s eyelids were almost meeting
when Mr. Ross 'spoke again.
“Seems to me,” he said very softly, “that
g ] ie > s ’ ar( ] ened lip a lot since Bill went away.”
1 ,, , .
,^ le of lodds eyes showed clearly
between the lids.
Mr. Ross pondered for a mmnte and then
added: “Pity you only ’ad Bill.”
Todd’s voice sounded strange to his friend
as he sighed: “The others might’ve gone too.”
Once more Mr. Ross pondered, agreed and
was silent.
They had finished their pipes when Mrs.
Todd’s voice warned her husband that it
was time to get ready for church; and, as
Mr. Ross’s courage wasn’t strong enough to
take him past the kitchen to the front gate,
Todd let him out at the back and went into
the house. ,
Many years had passed since orthodoxy
made any appeal to him, but he believed
in peace, and was a regular attendant at
evening service and a regular feeder ot the
wooden plate that was always hungry. But
i n spite of his desire to walk as smooth a
matrimonial path as possible, he refused
to be converted, and to this stubborn turn-
ing away from grace Mrs. lodd secretly
attributed the fact that their only child had
gone off to sea. It was a judgment,
_ She was convinced that the hardening ot
his heart against conversion had made him
hard in other things. He didn’t even seem
to feel Bill s going much. She told her
friends that Bill s choice of the sea had
broken her heart; but as tor the boy s fathei
—-well, he rarely so much as mentioned
the boy. , .
,As he went off to work on the morning
after Ross s visit the thought that if a letter
didn’t come that day it would be three
weeks overdue made him hurry on. ror a
fortnight and more lie had been trying to
comfort .lumself with the assurance that the
boy was young and thoughtless. But to-day
the assurance had no power to lift the sense
of dread that made lum work desperately
and desperately wish for five o clock.
When he reached the house, the sense of
dread that had spurred him on all day
changed to paralysing fear. The blinds were
down! . , .
Stunned to immobility, he stood staring
at one of the windows and then walked
blindly up the side path towards the back
door. As he opened the door he was barely
conscious of the presence of two neighbors,
and his wife’s sobs seemed to come from
ever so far away. Someone put a letter
into • his hand, and as he looked at it six
words stood out from the page, stabbing dul-
ness into pain and making him acutely con-
scious of the presence of the two women,
Why had they come?
The letter fell from Ins hand as he turned
abruptly from them and walked out ot the
door towards the little shed.
The first thing he saw was the half-
finished model of a sailing-ship which he
and Bill were making when the boy went
away. He had hoped that some day they
might finish it. But now.. . bix words
had killed that hope: Death of your son
at sea.”
As he stood staring at the little model he
knew that all he lived for had gone,
Where?
Suddenly lie remembered the boy's lust
greeting on that grey day when he and
Maria stood on the pier and watched the
steamer move out. Making a megaphone of
his hands, Bill had sent them one word:
“Cheerio !”
Now he asked himself a question—the
most profound question he had ever asked :
When —when the boy set out on this....
this other journey, did.... did he say
“Cheerio”?
He touched the little hull softly, ques-
tioniugly, and then was conscious of a sound
that came from the wattle-tree. A thrush
was singing exultingly as though it was
trying to express all the golden glory of
the sunset. Todd lifted his grey face and
listened.
“Cheerio, cheerio, cheerio!”
After the bird had ceased singing he stood
very still, listening, thinking. Was that the
answer to his question? Perhaps....!
The thought lifted some of the greyness
from his face ; and as he stood with his hand
lightly touching the little model, he was
swiftly aware of a sense of companionship
—the old companionship, but richer, closer.
Shutting his eyes, he was giving himself up
to a deep sense of comfort when somebody
spoke to him. With a start he was back
in a world that lacked Bill.
Yes, yes, he would go to his wife.
She was sitting in a chair near the
shrouded window. A ray from the setting
sun crept through a chink at the side of
the blind and showed him her swollen eyes
and the redness of her face. Pity made
him want to go to her and say that all was
well with the boy, but Mrs. Clark was there.
Besides, Maria wouldn’t understand. He
stood hesitant. What was he to do? Then
almost without volition he drew Up the
blind. The flood of light seemed to sweep
away Maria’s sobs, and, staring aghast, she
asked him what he was doing.
“Seemed to me there wasn’t any use shut-
tin’' out the light,” he said, and while she
upbraided him for lack of decency, he slowly
pulled down the blind.
He didn't want the new black suit that
he wore for the first time on Sunday morn-
ing. When the clergyman dedicated the
service to the memory of the son of one
who was foremost in good works, Mrs.
Todd's grief was tinged with elation. While
the choir sang funereal hymns and the
clergyman talked funereal platitudes, she
wept into her black-edged handkerchief; but
Todd stared past the choir and the clergy-
man. All through the week he had sought
that vivid sense of companionship. Per-
haps it would come this afternoon—in the
little shed.
All the afternoon he waited for what he
believed had been the spirit of his son; but,
though the thrush shouted “Cheerio” and the
link of the little, half-finished boat was be-
side him, loneliness dimmed the gold of the
wattle-tree. When evening came loneliness
seemed to fill the whole world.
Through the weeks that followed he
thought about things when he should have
been sleeping and while he worked. Would
he never again see Bill smile —hear liis
“Cheerio”? When he said “No” to these
questions, the memory of that clear, close
sense of companionship broke into the
finality of negation. But he wasn’t sure.
After a night when the silence had seemed
one huge question, he went to his work
jaded and uncertain. While he worked he
sought for something that would satisfy
this hunger for the certainty that had
momentarily lifted all the darkness from that
dark afternoon.
Suddenly he ceased to dig.
At last he knew!
Bill had come back to say that everything
was all right—cheerio !
The little boat would never be finished.
But there were other things they would do
together. Better things.
All at once the partly-dug bed typified
his life. He looked at the soft earth and
then at the undug strip. It was small.
Yes, most of his life was over. But for a time
he must dig—there were still a few weeds.
After that everything was probation. He
must dig that little strip and then. ... !
The change in him worried Mr. Ross.
Ever since the news had come he didn’t
seem to care about anything—not even the
strike. But lately—his eyes! Mr. Ross
couldn’t bear to look at his eyes. They
didn’t seem to notice you ; locked past —a
long way past. Sad yet happy—somehow.
Spring, summer, autumn gave place to
winter which put most of Todd’s plants to
sleep. But there was work to do—digging,
lawn-mowing; the strip wasn’t finished yet.
One afternoon as he pushed the mower
he felt old —strangely old. And he was chilly
when the work was done; not even his over-
coat warmed him. After tea he hung over
the fire; hut shivers rau up and down his
back, across his shoulders. His limbs ached.
In the morning he felt older still and too
sick to eat more than a mouthful of breakfast.
But he went to work —you must do your job.
When lie got home he couldn’t eat his tea,
and in the morning he knew that the strip
was dug. The doctor said it was influenza
and double pneumonia—he must go to hos-
pital. But to Maria “hospital” spelt death,
and she didn’t want Bob to die. Especially
unrepentant. They had a cousin who was
a nurse—she would come.
He was glad he had finished the strip.
This business in his chest was terrible, but
it was a way out —yon always had to fight
your way out. While he fought to get out
Maria fought to keep him; but when at
last she realised that her battle was lost
she forgot his body and concentrated on his
soul.
He didn’t want the clergyman, and she
hated to go against him at the last. But
fear made her send for the man who she
believed could pilot him to salvation even
now.
When the pilot had gone she went back
to her husband.
He was lying propped by pillows, breath-
ing shallowly, quickly, and there was a light
in liis face that frightened her.
He had forgotten the prayers and exhor-
tations. While they were going on he had
been listening, listening for the password
that would take him over to Bill. And now
that it might come any minute there was
a radiance in his face.
Maria gave the Reverend Mr. Welch credit
for that radiance. It was wonderful —won-
derful ! Yet it made you afraid. But she
had never given in to fear, and, going to
the bedside, she leaned towards the shining
face that was so unlike Bob’s face and
asked:
“You’re saved, Bob?”
She had to lean very close to hear his
answer, which came like the ghost of a
hundred other answers.
“May be,” he whispered.
Then hearing a “Cheerio” that was too
subtle for Maria’s ears, he held out his hand
to Bill.

Sweet Briar.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
WHERE have the little folk gone—the
briar-rose people
Who danced when the harebells chimed in
the fairy steeple?
Tell me, O breeze!
The field-mice play in the grasses brave in
the gloaming,
But the orchard is sad. Oh, where are they
roaming?
The apple-trees
Sing and laugh no more—they have grown
old with the waiting:
Their hands are knotted and tired —and I i
I am hating
To know the moon
Will presently splash the grasses with fragile
yellow;
And part the blades for a glimpse of some
elfin fellow
In magic shoon!
The mopoke calls —and the wind is shaken
with weeping;
Oh, once an evil one came with a sharp blade
sweeping,
And mowed the briars,
All sweet with _ blossom and young leaf
greenly showing;
And the bleeding roots and the gold hearts
bravely glowing
Were burnt in fires.
The mopoke calls and calls, and the field-
mice scurry
.Through the long grass till it swings in a
silken flurry;
Wee elf and gnome
Sweet fairy maid and pixie—briar-rose
people—
Who danced when the harebells chimed in
the elfin steeple,
Come no more home!
TASMANIA.
NORMA L. DAVIS.
“And God Gave Man
Dominion."
[FOR THE BULLETIN. ]
THE sun was sinking: the communal-
house, though high on piles, was already
half-cloaked in gloom. The people, squat-
ting in family groups on the palm-lath floor,
still gobbled their food. From outside came a
droning which would soon fill the barn-like
building. But the smoking fires on the clay
hearths would hold the mosquitoes in check
until black night enveloped all.
Lying upon the floor were long, sausage-
shaped things, resembling pythons of the
mammoth age—sleeping-baskets these, of
finely-woven cane; most of them made long
enough to shelter a family lying end
to end.
Leering from the shadowed walls were
man-sized masks of terrifying aspect. Horrid
weapons were stacked everywhere. Bundles
of foodstuffs mingled their musty odors with
those of prized portions of two men and a
woman, smoke-dried, withered.
Men and women grunted as they grabbed
baked sago and fish; children snatched their
eooked crocodile and sago like ravenous cubs,
fighting with the pigs that squealed among
them for food.
But all were listening, as they ever do.
They listen subconsciously as we breathe.
They listen for news!
HONEYMOON WORRIES.
"Jack, I'm sure I can hear someone running behind .”
It is always coining to them, though a
white man would not recognise it. It comes,
faint sometimes as a sigh in the wind. It
eomes from all directions, day and night,
moaning over vast areas of water and grass;
it throbs, it comes as a tremor diminishing
into distance, it comes from the invisible
mountains, from the unmeasured swamps,
Its reverberations, harsh and sinister, boom
out their message over village after
village.
It is the garrimuts that speak, the giant
garrimuts of the Upper Sepik, huge gongs
of man-length, fashioned cunningly of hol-
lowed tree. By its tone these people know
from which village a garrimut booms; they
read its message of fighting, of dancing, of
initiation rites or festal ceremonies—of
matters which interest the tens of thou-
sands of savage men who listen day and night
on the Upper Sepik, waters of mystery.
Even that hated, that dreaded, that super-
natural creature, the white man, cannot
creep up the great brown river without
every stone-age village getting a warning
that he comes. And from the river villages
the news is passed on across the swamps to
the villages lying out amongst the grasses
that the white man has never yet seen.
Suddenly, with one accord, they rushed to
the platform beyond the entrance. Kumunga
leaped there first, his eyes shining, his mouth
drinking in the news. For this that they
heard now was the news that the Sepik loves,
this news that came in deep, sinister tones.
It was the knell of death; it told of the
taking of heads. At Parambei, only eight
miles away. Their warriors had just brought
in five heads.
As Kumunga listened, his broad, savage
face was transformed; his habitual scowl
vanished. lie listened breathlessly, with a
child-like eagerness.
A strong man this, young Kumunga, but
not blooded yet. His big chest rose to each
roll of the garrimut. His arms, with swell-
ing shoulder muscles, hung to his flanks;
the big-palmed hands clenched and relaxed.
His body was strength personified; and now
the blood-lust gleamed from his eyes. He
looked what he was, a Ohauash, a wild man
of the swamps, scenting blood.
As the village listened into the night, clouds
of mosquitoes rose from the grass and mud
pools beneath the houses. Many of the
villagers, desirous of the last throb of the
news, clung to the platform, thrashing their
naked bodies with their hands. A young
girl peered covertly from a mat cubicle,
reading Kumunga’s face. She measured his
proportions. She gloried in his strength,
but she breathed deeper yet to the fierce
lust in his eyes. Soon he would wear the
flying-fox skin. With wild beating at her
heart she gloated on her choice.
The crowd crept back into the house.
Kumunga only remained staring into the
night. The mosquitoes had come, had taken
over the whole earth. The families made
wild rushes in the dark. Fathers called to
laggard, mothers, for it is the mother with
her suckling babe who crawls into the sleep-
ing basket first. She creeps right to tin-
end, closely followed by the man, who butts
her with his head if she be unduly slow.
After the man liis eldest son. The last to
crawl in is responsible for tying the banket;
and the spirits help him should the father
wake in the night to the torture of being
eaten alive!
Kumunga could not bear the pests a
moment longer. On noiseless feet, he padded
across to Warminga’s cubicle. Hanging up
here was a loin covering, a flying-fox skin.
Kumunga stroked it with tingling fingers.
For this was the emblem of a head-hunter,
the sign for all to see that he who wore
it had taken the head of a man.
An altercation arose from Ivumusa’s sleep-
ing basket. Growling as he brushed his
body, Kumunga gave the .night entirely to
the mosquitoes, and groped through the dark-
ness to his own sleeping basket. For each
young man has a basket of his own.
Furious grew the row from Kumusa’s
corner, where the man’s angry curses were
overridden by the screaming vituperations
of Sliabungun, his ten-year-old daughter.
Her brothers had pulled her out by the legs
and left to her the responsibility of closing
up the basket; and before she had recov-
ered her balance the family pig had rushed
in. Shabungun was now struggling with
his hind-legs, while he made his protests,
Her brothers and sisters were kicking down
the length of the basket; their father
was kicking from its higher reaches, and
roaring because the hungry mosquitoes were
swarming in upon him.
The frenzied child had the pig almost out
of the basket, when with a practised kick
it sent her flying amongst the cooking pots,
whilst it scrambled up the basket over the
bodies of the younger boys until it shoved
its snout hard up against the eldest
brother.
With a scream of anger Shabungun picked
herself up and writhed her skinny body far
up the basket. The cunning pig, lying snug,
HE’D HAD HIS BAD SPELLS.
“Grandad, have you ever been troubled with dyspepsia?”
“Only when I’ve tried to spell it, Jack.”
had hunched his legs tightly under his body.
The girl did not attempt to grip them withm
those tight-packed quarters. She clawed
over her struggling brothers and howled as
she wormed her head underneath the beast;
then turning up her mouth she fastened her
terrible teeth'in his groin.
Immediately the house rang to a crescendo
of piercing squeals. The girl held on despite
kicks, and the pig, feeling that no relief would
come by staying there, began to back out,
his squeals made more piercing as the child
quickened his decision with vicious bites and
tugs. Men snarled through their baskets
demanding peace; youths howled advice to
Shabungun’s brothers to kick her out; above
all, Kumusa, the
father roared the un-
mentionable things he
would do to his daugh-
ter should she cripple
his pig.
The long sleeping-
basket convulsed it-
self to the centre of
the floor like a gigan-
tic serpent in travail;
it collided with the
family basket of Kam-
bam, and then Hell
broke loose.
But Shabungun
ejected her pig, and
giving it a parting
bite she dived into the
end of the basket and
drew the opening
close. Making a bail
of her body, she took
in silence the kicks
coming to her from
the brothers, who were
receiving theirs from
the brothers higher up,
who collected theirs
from the father, who
was receiving his tri-
bute in abuse from all
quarters of the great
barn. Then vigorously
the family set to the
work of killing the
mosquitoes that had
entered during the brnwl. Tjntil that 'was
accomplished there could be no sleep.
Of course, the fault was with Kumusa s
wife. She would have babies. Other families
had room enough for their pigs to sleep with
them. But Kumusa’s basket was not made to
hold the world ! Someone had to stay outside.
At last darkness and sleep won, and even
the grunts of a disconsolate pig died down
as the animal snuggled closer for warmth.
But Kumunga lay awake. His mmd saw
only the flying-fox skin What joy must he
the portion of a man who earned the right to
wear the skin! H’e stretched his great arms
against the basket, in an agony that he who
was so strong had not yet been given the
chance to kill a man. . ' .
With the morning came the exhilaration
of a new day. After they had eaten the
women trooped laughing to the fishing net.-,
and the men strolled with guffaw and mimic
snpar-throwing to the gardens, as is the
custom on the Upper Sepik. But Kumunga s
o-arden-plot was well tended, and, free of cere-
monial duties, he idled out past the gardens,
o-lorving animal-like in the sunshine among
the betel-nut palms, his feet warming to the
ground, his eyes gazing across the golden
grass that rippled into
At the swamp edge he un through
water The” impatience of
the urge to prove himself a man, filled
kim t h a passion ,to. measure his strength
against something, anything !
He put his weight on the pole and the tiny
vessel cut through the grass and shot out on
to open water speckled dull green with lily
loaves. Grassy islets floated there, some
with trees growing from their mud. Twice
he jabbed savagely at the rough-tipped snout
of a crocodile as it rose from the lily leaves.
He lived so close to the animal kingdom
that he knew just where to strike to hurt,
and he laughed as a tail thrashed up from
the water. He had shot his canoe well out
of the way of vengeance.
From distant Parambei came the boom of
garrimuts. Kumunga listened with envy and
desire. The (village was calling its people to
the ceremonial dances accorded the victors in
yesterday’s head-hunt.
Kumunga dared not venture near that vil-
lage of more cultured people—they would
have his head in a twinkling. With sulky
lip he poled his canoe more slowly for-
ward. He could not understand what was
amiss. He felt man enough to hug the
world. Yet it had no place for him ; he was
but a Chauash, a man of the swamps!
Miserably he poled on, his prow rasping
gently over the broad lily leaves. Gliding
around a root-girded islet, his eyes fell on a
slab of grey in the sunlight.
Now, crocodiles swarm in those mighty
waterways. They are as familiar as pigs
and babies to the swamp; men, who trap
them, kill and eat them —and occasionally
are killed and eaten by them. Kumunga
dragged on his pole, snaking the canoe be-
hind the sleeping lizard.
Kumunga measured its length, his heart
quickening. Was lie man enough to tackle
the thing, alone; with his hands?
The crocodile Was seven feet long. Ku-
munga looked at the ridged back, the ser-
rated tail, the short stubby legs, the long
tapering snout.
Drawing a great breath he shot the canoe
forward; then with a flying leap he straddled
the beast and gripped its pointed snout,
wrenching back the upper jaw with a side-
ways twist that locked the snout under his
left armpit, while his left arm strained to
dislocate the lower jaw. Ilis legs were dug
deep in the mud under the beast’s belly, his
knees drawn hard behind its forelegs.
The saurian awoke to experience its jaws
wrenched wide apart. For a moment it lay
motionless, its eyes creased; then as its
back collapsed its tail was thrown up in
shocked agony. Frantically it scratched
mud, struggling to gain leverage; frantically
it lashed with its tail to smash this thing
that was breaking it. But Kumunga
wrenched the snout backwards and the tail
vainly thrashed the mud.
Kumunga thrilled to the struggle. Bunch-
ing his great muscles, he thrust and heaved,
mingling his breath with the steaming
breath of the beast. Its belly rumbled to
Kumuuga’s ecstasy, as he forced wide open
the slobbering throat that all the sky might
fall in. Mud spattered the grass and mingled
with the water as it writhed to turn an<
rush into the stream. But the man-animal
on its back pulled harder; its forepaws
vainly clawed the air; it roared like a bull as
its jaw was wrenched from its place.
Then Kumunga sprang clear, laughing as
the thing writhed towards the water in a lin-
gering death. Leaping to the canoe he seized
his limbon spear and rammed it down the
°aping throat. Filled with a singing pride,
such as but few civilised men may experience,
he raced to collect the tribe that they should
witness this sign of his manhood.

Dad.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
DAD ADAMS was the cook, the “babbling
brook,” of our light trench-mortar bat-
tery. For me he had always possessed
some strange but very certain fascination.
What was it about him that stamped him
so indelibly as a cook? I often wondered.
His greasy tunic, the soot marks on his
breeches, his untidy long hair, the uncon-
ventional way he wore his utterly shapeless
Digger hat, his shaggy eyebrows, the rusty
tips of his drooping moustache, the shine
of his perpetually sweating forehead? These,
of course, were all more or less hallmarks
of his profession. And then there was the
gruffness of his manner.
Gruff to the point of being inhuman Dad
was; and yet in the whole of the, battery was
there a Digger more human? When it came
to the point, who amongst the older members
of our unit could be more fatherly? Who,
too—so unfathomably strange to relate !
could be more gentle towards a French-
woman—dame or demoiselle? A strange
mixture of humanity and inhumanity, Dad;
it was this perhaps which made him so in-
evitably a cook.
That evening, tired out though I was after
the long day on the cobbled roads, alter-
“BROKE ALL RECORDS ON THE WAY HOME.”
nately marching and dragging tlu: ridiculous
handcarts used for the transport of our
Stokes mortars, I found myself closely study-
ing Dad as he sat there by the fireplace—
singularly enough, for a French house of
this type, a proper fireplace—sipping away,
with shoulders hunched, at his hastily-brewed
tea. There was an unusual complacency
about him, I thought, despite the fact that
only a little while ago our new O.C. had
been on his tracks again on the subject of
his personal appearance. Still, that would
not be likely to disturb Dad, I reflected. The
matter was one which all our previous O.C. s
had eventually abandoned as hopeless. Our
previous O.C.’s —we had had more than, a
few! But there was something suggestive
of the perpetual about Dud—empires might
rise and empires might fall, but in his. own
exclusive way he would still go on cooking—
cooking until Doomsday!
“What’s it to be for breakfast to-morrow,
Dad —boiled or fried?”
I turned round sharply. So Dad had been
engaging someone else’s attention. It was
Sparrow Bird, I saw, who had spoken. And
he was trying to bait Dad, was he, with the
old familiar question? The question which
brought forth, if anything, the one reply:
“Boiled or fried, it’s bacon! ’S all tli’ same,
ain’t it —bacon !”
Fried! With all the extra trouble it in-
volved, a fat chance we stood of having to-
morrow’s bacon fried, I told myself. Why,
some time to-morrow we would be well
through Lc Cateau, right on to the heels
of the retreating Huns! It would be iron
rations, too, after the morning meal. Fried?
Of course Sparrow hadn’t been serious —he
had simply put the question as a gibe. But
he would be lucky if he got Dad to “bite
to-night!
It was as I had thought. Old Dad had
made no reply this time. Yet it had been
eloquent enough, the way he had half-turned
liis head and spat into the hissing fire.
No one had come to Sparrow’s support:
and I decided that as. soon as I had finished
my tea I would turn in.
Scarcely had I set out my bunk when I
heard it —that rumbling sound in the street
outside.
“We’re not the only people on the job!”
someone grinned.
Whatever the vehicle was it must be just
about to pass the house. My curiosity
aroused, I turned and looked through the
open doorway, hoping to catch, in the light
from the few flickering candles, a glimpse
of the thing as it passed by.
And then, not a little astonished, I saw
what it was —a wheelbarrow! A wheelbar-
row, packed with bedding and miscellaneous
small articles of furniture, and it had come
to rest outside the very door! Refugees?
Yes, and here they were, coming in!
Shall I ever forget them as they appeared
then —that trio? The old, white-haired cure,
advancing shakily across the floor, his lips
moving uncontrollably; the young French
woman in the absurdly long coat —a German
soldier’s coat turned inside out, I later recog-
nised it to be —and the little boy with the
glossy peaked cap shyly bringing up the
rear. Utterly worn out they were —fear in
the eyes of all of them; they looked half-
starved, too. They had made their way from
one of the villages up beyond Be Cateau;
one of the villages which, until the last day
or so, the Huns had occupied for so long.
The bombardment Fritz had put up in cover-
ing liis retreat —had it proved too hot for
them?
Feeling strangely embarrassed, we watched
them move towards the fireplace: towards
old Dad. They were half-famishing, these
people, and they had singled out Dad as
the cook—how could even they, strangers,
possibly mistake him!
Old Dad had risen to his feet. He alone
of us seemed to have kept his composure.
Suddenly the old cure halted and, turn-
ing, faced us. It seemed to have suddenly
occurred to him that what he wished to say
might be of concern to us all. It was obvi-
ous what he was going to say.
“Food? Could you give us food, Mes-
sieurs?”
That, spoken in French,' seemed to break
the ice, and soon we were crowding round.
Presently we had installed the whole three
of them more or less comfortably by the
fire, and were thrusting upon them —it did
not need . much thrusting—what bread and
cheese remained from our evening ration,
while Dad busied himself ladling out the
dregs of the dixie of tea.
They were ravenous, all three. Having
signified their gratitude—-even the little boy
showed his thankfulness, I was a little sur-
prised to see—they set to and’devoured the
food, seemingly completely absorbed in them-
selves, altogether unmindful of '• us.
It was but natural, I suppose, that I
should pay attention to the woman most cf
all. She looked younger, scarcely more
than a girl,, now that the blood was mount-
ing into her cheeks from the warmth of the
tea; she had slipped back her knitted Shawl,
and I found myself admiring her wavy, fair
hair, arranged in the fashion so much fav-
ored by the provincial Fr.ench women. As
T watched her I kept wishing and wishing
that something could be done to allay that
look of fear which still lingered in her eyes.
Whatever ordeal of shellfire the three had
been through, she had suffered most of all—
this had been obvious from'the first.
Already the old cure and
the little boy had regained
their equanimity. So much
so that some of the chaps
bad decided to do something
to entertain them, and were
now dragging out the bat-
tery gramophone. I was not
in sympathy with this idea.
These people, like ourselves,
really needed rest; still, our
lack of knowledge of each
other’s language was prov-
ing a handicap, and the
playing of the gramophone,
even if it did not succeed in
brightening them up—the
accursed tinpot thing that
it was!—would at least be
further evidence of our
goodwill. The little boy, at
all events, would be pleased.
That first record ! For the life of me I
can’t recall what it was. But I know that
at the time it struck me as being singularly
inappropriate, and it was with some relief
that I reminded myself that the old cure
particularly knew hardly any English. His
attitude, as the “entertainment” began, was
one of polite attention. For a while I
thought that he was taking it all in; then
I saw that he had fallen fast asleep, his
head sunk deep on his chest, his hands loosely
folded.
Old Dad, who in the meantime had been
somewhat in the background, was quick to
see this. Now that the old care had gone
to sleep, what was to be done with the girl?
She could hardly sleep here on the floor along
with us. She would have to be put some-
where upstairs : that was the answer to the
question. She would be without the benefit
of a fire, of course; but still there seemed
to be plenty of bedding in the wheelbarrow.
“Couchcr, Ma’m’selle? Voucher?” pre-
sently he said to the girl.
' It scarcely came as a surprise, to me to
see her start the way she did. The ques-
tion had been rather open to misinterpre-
tation. But Dad’s bearing, the utter incon-
gruity of it all, managed shortly to reassure
her. And before long, having taken the bed-
ding from the wheelbarrow, he had set up
some sort of a bunk, and was escorting the
girl upstairs. It is rather curious, when I
come to think of it, that none of us lent
him any assistance. We reasoned, I suppose,
that the job was one which could best be
done by the oldest member of our party.
Dad seemed to
remain an uncon-
scionable length of
time up above ; but
we were too dog-
tired even to ban-
ter him about it.
Yet dog - tired
and all I could not
he 1 p suspecting
Sparrow Bir d.
Could Sparrow be
trusted to leave
the girl undis-
turbed? I had
been watching
him; and I didn’t
like the looks lie
shot at her. Still,
old Dad had taken
upon himself her
guardianship and
that should put
Sparrow off any
nonsense. Not, of
course, that Dad
could give much of
an account of him-
self. ...but, any-
way, we were all
on the spot; it
wasn't as though
Sparrow had the
place to himself.
Dad had return-
ed to his seat by
the fireplace. Hum-
ming away softly
to himself, he was
poking about at
tlie fire, giving it
a final stoke-up
before turning in.
One candle only
now remained
alight; by it I
could see that the
old cure was
slumbering still.
There was a look
of peace about him
now which remains
in my mind yet.
The little boy had
tired of playing
with the handle of
the gramophone,
and had dozed off
alongside the box
on which it had
been set up.
With a final
look in Sparrow Bird’s direction, I settled
down under my blanket, and was soon sound
asleep.
I wonder if it was that which actu-
ally awakened me or whether it was the
sound of those footsteps coming down the
stairs. So Sparrow had been up to his
tricks ; he had taken advantage of the situa-
tion ! That was my angry conclusion —until
I saw from the light of the candle he was
holding before him that it was not Sparrow
but Dad ! Old Dad !
And then, amazed, spellbound. I heard it
from the room above. The crying, the un-
mistakable crying, of an infant!
So astonished was I that with one move-
ment I sat upright in my bunk. The girl,
the French girl upstairs—so she had given
birth to a child! Good God ! But —but it
was impossible!
As if deliberately to contradict me on
the point, the crying broke out with re-
newed vigor. And then the fear-struck eyes
of the girl came back to me. Her fear —
so it had not been the result of shellfire
alone!
THE NEW HOME.
NEW PRISONER (in gaol): “Nice big place you have here. I should think people could
get. lost in it.”
WARDER: “They do, too; it takes some of them years to find their way out.”
“You the only one awake?”
For the moment I had lost consciousness
of Dad.
“Looks like it.” I answered him as I
glanced around. “So”
As I spoke I looked at him closely. He
seemed years older.
He was looking at me speculatively.
“Il'm,” he said at last, "p'raps you're a
bit young. I’d better wake someone else.
THE HUMAN HEN.
OBLIGNG COCKY (to parson who has no incubator of his own ):
“ Yairs! vuccan bring all the aigs you got. My ole woman
starts ’atchin' a few Monday week.”
The worst's over, though. I’ve done my
whack —somebody else can carry on !”
With that he aimed a gentle kick at the
sprawling figure of the fellow on my right.
Tiger Nolan it was; and it struck me in-
stantly that lie could have shown better
judgment.
It was enough to rouse the whole room,
the noise Tiger made on waking. In no
time half of us were awake —or half-awake.
And the looks on their faces when they real-
ised what had happened —I can see them
half-rising from their bunks, staring open-
mouthed at the ceiling!
“What d’you know 7 about that!” It was
a regular chorus.
Dad w r as having a bit of trouble, I saw.
Apparently Tiger Nolan wash’t relishing the
idea.
“What about his Nibs here?” lie coun-
tered, meaning the cure.
There was a general chuckle at this; and
Tiger himself perceived that his suggestion
was hardly suitable.
From upstairs still came the sound of the
baby’s cries.
“Come on, Tiger, have a heart!” said
someone.
But still Tiger was not to be persuaded.
Some idea had struck him. I saw.
“That kid! Why, as like as not the kid’s
father’s a Hun!” he snapped. “D’yer think
I’m goin’ to”
The child of a Hun ! I had said nothing,
but that’s what I, too, had been thinking.
What was it—a boy or a girl? In the
excitement I had forgotten to ask that of
Dad. A Hun’s kid! Bearing in mind the
fact that the village—wherever it was—from
which the girl had come had been in the
Germans’ hands for at least two years—why,
it was more than likely!
Tiger’s objection was receiving some sup-
port, I saw. Now that he had raised this
question, I think that all of us for the time
being had forgotten the girl herself. And
then
Dad —Dad Adams—old Dad ! Never shall
I forget him as I saw him at that moment.
With his candle held aloft, the grease trick-
ling down on to his fingers unnoticed, he
seemed to tow 7 er above us all like some wonder
of statuary, a poised figure, a figure incon-
gruously but manifestly noble! Then, the
grotesque shadow of his form on the wall
behind him seeming strangely to anticipate
rather than follow the movement, he turned
to Nolan and his eyes flashed fire.
“A H'un’s kid!” he thundered. “And what if
he is? Ain’t a kid a kid the whole world
ever?” >
“Boiled or fried!”
I spun round, to find out whose quick wit
had saved the situation. Of all people,
Darky Johnson !
That laugh settled it. To give Nolan his
due. he had already risen to his feet.
“Boiled or fried!” —the words had set me
thinking. I turned to Dad. _ “Don’t you
think you might alter your mind about to-
morrow’s breakfast?” I grinned. “Just to
mark the special occasion?”
A roar of assent went up; then suddenly,
mindful of the girl upstairs, a hush fell
among us.
Dad’s features, too, broke into a grin.
“You can have your bacon as you like,” he
said. “But you’re goin’ without milk in yer
tea .for a bit.”

Rhyme of the Wandering Shadows.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
HO ! for the wandering shadows among the
trees!
Trees at the nightfall, lingering over the lees
Of the light, mistrustfully waiting, and
watching askance
In the jungle; bamboos leaning slow in a
dance
For the hunchback vines; old paperbarks
standing stiff,
Swathed like ragged mummies; banyans, as if
Their branches were octopus-tentacles gravely
searching,
Spewing an inky dusk around, besmirching
The torches, pink and white, of the frangi-
panni;
The pirate poinciana, with flowers too many,
Flinging them, piles of doubloons, on the
greedy ground;
While little angel lilies without a sound
Kneel praying for grace in the grossness
brought by these
Wandering shadows prowling among the
trees.
I went out like a shadow among them, too,
And I was one with their wandering waste,
and knew
Their dread and their sorrow; the bamboos
whispered it
As a dragon-fear where the flyingffoxes flit;
The thick vines creaked its meaning, vague
as the scents
That came through the paperbark’s tattered
cerements;
And the smothered molian sound of the ban-
yan-strings
Was a grief more horrid than any madman
sings;
The frangipanni’s chant was an incense-sway
Of its fire by night for a mercy of cloud by
day;
The poincianas flung empty scabbards down.
Muttering braggart oaths of their red
renown;
But though I stooped I could hear no mur-
mured saying
Of the little lilies, yet I knew they were
praying, praying.
The merging night is at last a comfort that
fills
The sullen hearts of the pampered jewelled
hills.
The trees are silent, nor can I see them now,
And a slow rain puts cold fingertips on
my brow.
The shadows arc sad loves gone with a little
smiling
Into forgetfulness ; such is the long beguiling
Of time and of hope with its endless bright
despair;
For life is death diffused in the glad noon
air
For the space that a jest required or a whim
decrees,
Then —ho for the wandering shadows among
the trees!
N.T.
FREDERICK T. MACARTNEY.
The Clue of Fatty Beeman.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
BILLY PAGAN and his mate and shadow,
Albert Merry, on their lawful occa-
sions of recording for their papers
unlawful things as police-roundsmen, read
the latest notice on the wall of the lockup-
keeper’s room. There were rewards for the
apprehension of a person or persons un-
known responsible for sundry murders and
arsons—evidence of the limited ability of the
law to deal with serious infractions of it;
evidence of tin l fact that one earnest crimi-
nal can hold up at least for a time a com-
munity not so earnest.
“There’s a new one. Billy.”
“It’s been there an hour—long enough to
put it into the vernacular. It’s known
alieady as the Sea-chest Tragedy.”
Merry read it. It related that on the 9th
of October a seaman’s chest of camphor-
wood discovered floating in the Yarra was
found to contain the headless, naked body of
a man, aged, apparently, about thirty-five,
spare frame ; hands blunted by toil and appar-
ently the hands of a seaman; both outer and
inner skins on arms, legs and breasts cut
away in places; and whereas the said body
bore evidence of violence, murder must be
presumed. Therefore (following on many
whereases) the Governor-in-Council offered
a reward of five hundred pounds for such
evidence as would lead to arrest of the
actual perpetrator of the murder as afore-
said.
“The beheading is easily accounted for,”
said Merry—“to prevent or delay identifica-
tion. But why the cutting off of both skins
in places?”
“Same reason,” replied Billy Pagan.
“They say the hands of a seaman. There-
fore probably tattooed.”
“Who’s on it?”
“All of them, including my mate, Joe
Gannon. Everybody’s on it —except,” he
added, and rather slyly, as a big shadow fell
across them, “Fatty Beeman.”
“Conshtable Beeman, if you please.”
They turned and looked upon a tremen-
dous man; a policeman so large that he
almost justified Billy Pagan’s exaggeration
of him as “eight feet high and seven feet
thick.”
“Fatty” Beeman had been thirty years
a policeman and had never been mentioned
in despatches. After thirty years of ser-
vice he was still a constable —not even a
senior. He had entered the force imme-
diately he became twenty-one, and ever
since that day he had gained only in material
weight. All beef and bone he was : slow of
movement as incapable of thought. His
vacuous blue eyes, of that light porcelain
blue that belongs to willow-pattern china
and the carapaces of the soldier crab, looked
out upon a world which knew but one detect-
able crime, the wandering of stray goats
and horses, whose frugal owners turned them
out to feed upon the communal grass of
back lanes. His heavy, humorless face re-
garded the world with the wonder of a
child; mentally, Constable Beeman was 12
years old, though he had been 51 years upon
the earth. When he was questioned the
rolls of fat upon his forehead moved as if
an attempt at thinking gave him physical
pain. As Billy Pagan said, “He was the
only literally fat-headed man in captivity
or out of it.”
Billy smiled and accepted the correction.
“ ‘Constable Beeman’ it is. Have you seen
this, Fatty?”
“ ’Twas read to us morn in’ parade, young
man. Mister Pagan. An’ I suppose you
think that only your pet Joe Gannon would
find the mu’d’rer.”
“No. Everybody has a chance —it’s an
open field.”
“Anny man has a chance, has he? An’
with you printin’ in the paper, ‘Clever Cap-
sliures by Detective Gannon’; but never a
clever capshure by Conshtable Beeman.”
“Gannon does something and you don’t.”
“How can I be makin’ clever capshures
an’ me always on shtrayin’ goats an’ cows
an’ horses in back lanes?”
“Something happens even in back lanes
sometimes.”
Fatty Beeman’s forehead quivered as In;
thought over this tremendous discovery, and
at last grudgingly admitted its probability.
“Yis, I suppose ’twould be so. There
was once a murdher in a laundhry.”
“Quite true, Fatty,” said Billy Pagan.
“And there might be a political conspiracy
at a coffee-stall.”
“Thrue ! Thrue !” Beeman nodded gravely
as he admitted everything. “An’ now, young
feller, Mr. Pagan, how would a man find
it out?”
A NASTY WAY THESE MODELS HAVE!
DAUBER: “Here, Miss Sylph! What have you been up to? You're not a bit like I
painted you yesterday!”
Killy Pagan grinned as he replied, “Well,
first he’d find out that something had hap-
pened and then he’d look for a clue.”
“He would, then, he would! And what
might the clue be?”
Merry looked at Billy and shook his head
in deprecation of the leg-pulling. Billy
smiled reassurance at him, and turned to
leave the simple Beeman. But Beeman re-
peated his question: “And what might the
clue be?”
“Oh, anything,” replied Billy. “It might
be a town hall—and you couldn’t miss that.
Or it might be half a postage-stamp. Or
a piece of string. So long, Fatty.”
“So long,” Beeman repeated, too interested
to resent the “Fatty.” “So long, Mr. Merry.”
He watched the reporters as they left the
police-yard, and said again, “A town ’arl
or a piece of shtring.”
* * * *
Joe Gannon, the detective who had won
promotion, partly by his own energies and
his knowledge of the ways of certain stock
criminals —a knowledge which enabled him
to fit a crime on an offender whose idiosyn-
crasies betrayed him —but more by Billy
Pagan’s judicious booming of him (the
“clever capshures” sneered at by Constable
Beeman), vainly essayed to identify the
criminal by the crime in this newest tragedy.
“You see,” Gannon told Billy Pagan,
“there’s nothing to go on.”
“There’s a body without a head. Joe.”
“Yes, but none of my old hands are in
it. The man hadn’t been dead six hours
when we got the body in the trunk. And
I got a line on all the wharf rats and water-
front toughs, and they’re all accounted for
before and after, so what can a man do?”
“Find the head.”
“Plow? Where?”
“Hook in all the places where it isn’t, and
if the elimination is complete you’ll only
have to look in the place where it is.”
“That’d look well in print, but it doesn't
g-'t us anywhere. I checked up on all the
blokes I know.”
“Don’t see much use in that, Joe. Do
you think this new break is possible to the
stereotyped burglars and till-tliieves and con.
men who give you this day your daily
bread ?”
"No: I can’t see Looking-Glass Fred or
Billy the Bull or Flash Mick or The Nec-
tarine doin’ a job like this. Sounds more
as if it came from a joint that takes down
sailors.”
“Why need the body be a sailor's?”
“Well, tattoo marks and blunt fingers.”
“I’ve known of weak-minded university
men becoming tattooed in some moment of
reversion to savages. I knew a curate who
had a mermaid tattooed on his arm —because
he had once been a health trip on a wind-
jammer. And there are plenty of sailor-
men with long fingers.”
“Long fingers like a dip’s?”
“A dip or an artist. But it doesn’t matter
whether he was a sailor or not —not for
purposes of quick identification ; the class is
too numerous. Motive would be something,
and it might have been anything. Robbery
is out of it.”
“Yes, thieves wouldn't waste time trying
to destroy identity.”
“It may have been death by misadventure;
and then fear, to make the killer destroy
identity.”
“Or murder of an enemy whose identi-
fication alone would give the murderer
away.”
“And the enemy might have been a black-
mailer. That would make the killer a man
with a reputation—a respectable man. Are
any disappearances reported?”
“The few there were we traced—they led
to nothing. A bit of a mystery about
Smasher Jenks not fighting at the Stadium
last night. But this body was found two
days ago.”
“That isn’t the question, Joe. When vms
Jenks seen last? ITas he been seen during
the last three days? Find that.”
“I don’t think that goes anywhere, Billy,
but I’ll try it.”
Fatty Beeman, ready for four hours of
point-duty, found Billy Pagan and Merry in
the police-station and returned to the dis-
cussion of clues.
“Misthcr Pagan, ye was talkin' about clues
this marnin’ an’ ye said a Town ’Arl would
be clues, or shtring.”
“Yes, Fatty; or envelopes, or orange-pips,
or anything.”
“An’ I’ve been told that a man comes back
to the schene of his crime.”
“If he had any sense he wouldn’t; but
nearly all criminals haven’t any sense, so
I suppose he would.”
“An’ if a man would wait alongside the
clue, the man would come back?”
“He might if the first man waited long
enough.”
“Long enough,” repeated Fatty Beeman;
“I see.”
It was Fatty Beeman’s insistence on the
formula that prompted the newspaper-men
to a joke that seemed certain to recoil on
the makers of it had they not known Fatty
Beeman’s foolish persistence in any belief
once accepted, no matter how incredible it
might be.
“Let’s try it,” said Billy—“some string
and the Town Hall door.”
“It would take a lot to lead from there
to the police-yard.”
“About a hundred yards of it. What do
you think?”
“I’m on. Billy.”
“Well, buy the string; and come back
later, when Fatty is off duty.”
Late that afternoon Detective Gannon
found them.
“There’s nothing much in your theory,” he
told Billy Pagan. “I saw Prender —that’s
the chap who was backing Jenks for the
fight that didn’t happen last night. They
had a row about Jenks breaking his train-
ing.”
“Drinking, was lie ?’’
“Yes. Prender had him backed for big
money, and he’s sore at this fellow missing
the certainty of a win. lie says it was a
certainty, anyhow.”
“Where was he drinking?”
“Prender savs he was drunk with some
hangers-on at' his own lodgings, but the
people say they didn t see him all day yes-
terday.”
"Comb the hotels, then.
Gannon smiled at having anticipated the
advice. “Got them out now on it. But
that’s slow, and mightn’t lead anywhere.”
“How about trying identification?”
“Identify a body without a head.' 1 ”
“You know that Jenks has disappeared.
“Yesterday.” , . , .
“One man says he saw him yesterday—
Prender. Jenks’s bodily measurements can
be got. They were published in the sport-
ing papers before his first fight.”
“Why, that’s an idea, aiid I’m on to it.
What about the newspaper files at your
office?” , _ ™
“They’ll give you the facts, Joe. Go to
it.”
Merry and Billy Pagan returned to the
police-station. There Billy unrolled the
string, leaving one end at the entrance to
the police-yard, and paying it out as the.\
walked round the corner to the fiont of the
Town llall. There was string enough!to
lead across the twenty feet of open space
between the sidewalk and the stone staii
that led to the principal door. Arrived there,
Billy fastened the string to the great bronze
knob of the door; this done, the two returned
to the yard of the police-station.
Fatty Beemau had arrived. His first
words to Billy Pagan showed a fixation of
“About the clues, Misther
Pagan?” .
“Well, aren’t yoa a diehard?
I thought you’d have forgotten
it by now.”
“I’ve been thinking about it
arl the time.”
“Well,” said Merry in the
surprised tone of a man making
a discovery, “there’s one of
your clues.”
“An’ what is it?”
“The piece of string and the
Town Hall round the corner.”
The two followed Beeman as
he traced the string around the
lane and into the street faced
by the Town Hall. Beeman’s
glance followed the string to
its fastening on the doorknob.
“And what now?” asked
Merry.
“Well, well!” said Fatty Bee-
man. “ ’Tis there on the Town
’Arl. An’ what would it be
doin’ there?”
“Perhaps a signal to some-
body.”
“An’ p’raps, then, yis. An’
I’d watch it, then?”
“You could. Y’ou’re not on
duty.”
“Thrue, tlirue, ’tis me own
time. I’ll watch.”
“Out of sight, of course.”
“Of course, out of sight I’d
watch it. I'll go up the Town
’Arl steps an’ hide me ahind the
pillars.”
The two generously applaud-
ed the resolve ; and Fatty Bee-
man ascended the steps and con-
cealed himself behind one of the
pillars of the portico—a great
column of concrete that hid him
entirely. Merry and Billy
Pagan appeared to be returning
to the station; but by a flank-
ing movement they crossed the
street, unobserved by Beeman,
and watched that enthusiastic
detective from the corner of the
lane that led to the police-
station.
Four small boys passing the station found
the string, uttered shrill whoops of joy at.
the discovery, turned the lane Corner into
the street end ran with the string past the
Towm Hall. The noise told even Fatty Bee-
man that something was toward ; he was half-
way dowm the steps to arrest the malefactors
when they discovered him and turned back.
The foremost boy retained his hold of the
string, which broke off on the edge of the
steel railing. Fatty arrived at the sidewalk
too late to make an arrest; and the watchers
saw him examine the broken end and then
return to his vigil in the concealment of
the column.
“He’s a diehard all right, Billy.”
“It was a dangerous thing to give him one
idea. From now on it w'ill ride him for life.”
They watched for half an hour, but no
other passer-by disturbed the string that lay
upon the inner edge of the footpath; and, as
dusk threatened, Billy Pagan and Merry
returned to the police-station to await the
coming of Gannon.
And immediately they left the street some-
thing happened. Ten minutes later Fatty
Beeman, breathless and dishevelled, brought
in his prisoner, a heavy, insanitary wreck
of a man all whelks, whiskers and car-
buncles; a Pistol gone to seed; the genius
of vagrancy. His air of having been violently
turned round and round until he was
dizzy was explained by his captor.
“I was conshealed behind the Town ’Arl,”
said Beeman to the audience of the lockup-
keeper, tw r o resting policemen and the two
reporters, “whin me attintion was directed
to the prisoner. I see him attemptin’ to
sliteal a piece of shtring, the property of the
munishipality.”
“What did he want the string for?”
“He bruk off the shtring, an’ was goin’
to put it round a parshcl whin I arristed
him. He showed fight an’ kicked me shins,
an’ I thin shtruck him a clever little blow
with me baton.”
“That’s what made him look dizzy.”
“Just that—an’ now' I’ll charge him.”
“What with?” asked the lockup-keeper.
“Resistin’ arrist, assaultin’ me in the exe-
cution uv me duty, an’ obs.pie langwidge.”
“But what were you arresting him for?”
“Shtealing the shtring.”
“Not much of a charge. Anybody know
him?”

Nobody knew him; but one of the resting
policemen suggested “Vagrancy.”
The prisoner protested nothing; going like
a lamb to the slaughter which openetli not
her mouth.
“All right, search him. Turn out your
pockets.”
The lockup-keeper’s practised hands ran
swiftly over the prisoner as though he hated
the job—a fact explained by the prisoner’s
general frowsiness.
The swift search and the turning out of
the pockets disposed of the vagrancy charge.
“A fiver and four singles, a half-note and
seven shillings silver —can’t call it vagrancy.
But where did he get the money? What’s
your name, you?”
“Er —er —Alexander Smith,” replied the
prisoner.
“Took you longer to think out Alexander
than Smith. Where did you get the money?”
“A man paid me—money he owed me a
long time.”
“What’s his name?”
“Er —er —George Brown.”
One of the resting policemen had separated
the prisoner’s property other than money,
and from the little collection selected a key,
its central wards filed away.
“Here’s your charge, Fatty,” he said.
“Skeleton keys.”
The prisoner protested. “It’s only one.”
“Skeleton key, then. Where were you
born, Alexander?”
“Toorak,” said Alexander sulkily.
“Near Buckingham Palace. Wliat’s ycr
age, Aleck?”
“Forty-one or somethin’. I dunno.”
“Itead or write, Alexander?”
“Nacherly.”
“Put him down superior education.”
“All right. Education C. ~What religion,
Aleck?”
“1 dunno, nothin’.”
“He’s a Freetrader.”
The lockup-keeper put the blotting paper
on the entries, took from the hook the cell
keys, and said, “Come to your pew, Aleck.”
The prisoner sighed his relief, and entered
the corridor to the cells.
“Hid you notice,” said Billy Pagan, “that
fellow seemed glad to be locked up?”
“He’s home again, that’s all,” replied
Merry. 1
At that moment Detective Gannon entered
the station.
“H’lo .Toe,” said Billy Pagan—'“get the
measurements?”
“Yes, and they’re the same as Jcnks’s. But
Prender saw him last night.”
“He says he did.”
“And three other witnesses say, too. When
I went back to him he brought them along.
It’s a dead-end there. Anything new?” '
“Only Fatty Beeman’s broken the ice.” 5
“What did he get?”
“The bird in number six. We don’t know
him.”
“Let’s see him,” said Gannon; and the
lockup-keeper, turning back into the corri-
dor, led them to cell six and opened the
door.
“Here’s a gentleman to see you, er—
Smith,” lie said.
Smith slowly came forward to the detec-
tive, but kept his head down as if he would
avoid recognition.
“Smith nothing,” said Gannon. “This is
Fred Tunnie —one of the Bourke-street rats.”
When they had returned to the charge-
room lie asked: “What did you take him
for, Fatty?”
“He had a skeleton-key.”
“You didn’t know that when you took
him? What was he doing?”
“Tryin’ to shteal a piece uv shtring from
the Town ’Arl.”
“Get out with you! Why would he want
a piece of string?”
SOMETHING LIKE A GRIEVANCE.
THE KID: “Cripes, this is a nice time to get wrecked. How is Father Christmas going
to find me here?”
“To tie up a packidge.”
“What was in the package?”
“Well, I don’t know that.”
“Where is the package?”
“Well, now, in the tayver of shtrugglin’
with him, he dropped it.”
“Where?”
“Be the Town ‘Arl front.”
“And is it there now? Why, man, you’d
get into trouble for losing that. Go and look
for it. Was it dark, then?”
“’Twas that, an’ maybe ’tis there now.”
Made energetic by the fact that promised
glory might become the disgrace of negleet
of duty, Fatty Beeman ran out of the sta-
tion, and in a few moments returned reas-
sured and bringing the package. It was
a package as frowsy as the derelict who had
carried it. A fragile cord. encircled it, and
as Beeman attempted to cut the string the
lockup-keeper halted his intention. “Only in
the prisoner’s presence,” he said.' “I’ll bring
him.”
He took the keys again, and the five men
awaited his return; their interest centred on
this packet that had been soaked in the
street-sweepings and muddy water of the
gutter.
The prisoner re-entered, preceding the
keeper, and as his glance took in the package
his face under its coating of dirt became of
a sickly greeny pallor.
Gannon opened the package as the pris-
oner screamed: “I didn’t do it. Mr. Pren-
der gave me a tenner to take, it away. And
the string came off —that’s \ how I knew
what it was.”
Gannon threw open the last fold of paper,
And exposed the head of Smasher Jenks.
RANDOLPH BEDFORD.
“Liberty, Equality,
Fraternity.”
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
IN the spring of 191 G old Makar the Cos-
sack sat outside his cottage, thinking.
The sun was setting behind the hills and
the twilight filled his mind with vague fears.
For many years, since he had been freed
from military service, he had been content
to.plough his fields and gather the harvests.
People paid him respect for his long and
honorable service to his country. He was
considered a wealthy man, and his only son
Trophim was a boy to be proud of. Yet now
he felt uneasy, discontented.
An old dog, fat and short-legged, came out
of the open gate and put his head on Makar’s
knee.
“Getting old, Barboska?” Makar- asked,
and the dog, looking into his master’s eyes,
wagged his tail.
“We are both getting -old,” Makar con-
tinued reflectively. “Great events are hap-
pening in our country, Barbos, but we can-
not take part in them.” lit- spoke' as though
glad of the opportunity to give expression to
his thoughts. Then lie fell into silence,
thinking of the revolution and the rumors
of civil war. He recollected another revolu-
tion in 3005 when with General Renen-
kampf he. had ridden through Siberian towns
and villages leaving behind death and sorrow.
“It was a ghastly business,” thought Makar,
“but what could I do? A Cossack must
obey.” Now things were different. It was
no longer one small section of the people in
revolt ; the nation shouted “Liberty,
Equality, Fraternity,” their voices like
mighty thunder reverberating through the
world.
n Makar was not certain what he would do
if he were to take 'part. The Bolsheviks
promised the land to the peasants, and that
was well. But everything else seemed to be
breaking up. Beliefs, customs, traditions
were thrown on to the scrap-heap. There
was talk of rebuilding life upon new foun-
dations; but Makar felt too old to begin
anew and loath to part from wliat was dear
to him.
He rose in his distress and walked along
the quiet street. An old woman greeted him
from one of the open windows.
“Good evening to you, .Makar,” she said.
“Good evening to you, citizeness.” She
raised her head , and there was fear in her
faded eyes.
“And for whom is your son going to fight
now?” she asked.
Makar did not know. “I suppose for us,”
he answered vaguely.
“I wish he would.” he heard her say.
“They all seem to be fighting • amongst them-
selves and forgetting the people.”
“Quite true,” thought Makar while the
woman spoke again.
“Things are changing, Makar. Everything
old is being destroyed. We, too, wili have
to go with the old things.”
A soft breeze sprang up and stopped to
play with Makar’s long grey heard. The
woman stayed as though wishing to hear
him say something reassuring. But Makar
had nothing reassuring to say. Late into
the night he wandered in the fields, inhaling
the fragrance of the cheryomucha blossom,
and thinking, thinking.
Trophim came home, but there was not the
joy of a warrior returning. The lad felt
dejected and as though guilty of some-
thing. There was trouble everywhere now.
Civil war had broken out in Siberia. The
Czechoslovakian armies were gaining vie-
tories over the Reds, and Siberia was organ-
ising forces to help them win its own inde-
pendence. Trophim wished to enlist.
“It is only right that I should fight for
my country,” he argued.
But Makar was still worried. He disliked
the idea of letting foreigners fight for his
freedom; yet should the Bolsheviks become
masters, his wealth would be taken from him.
So he could not decide.
His wife Avdotya shared her husband’s
anxieties. To her the new conditions were
incomprehensible. She listened to the talk
A GOOD START.
GRANDPA ISAACSTEIN: “Sister Rebecca has a fine post-card album, and Daniel a splendid
lot of stamps. Now, what are you collecting?”
HOPEFUL IKEY (after a moment’s consideration ): “Frippenny bits, Grandpa, please."
of the Cossacks, endeavoring to learn of
their intentions, but always their speech was
elusive. They were no longer men who could
act in accord; even amongst those who for
centuries knew precisely what their duties
were, opinions differed on almost every ques-
tion. Some favored Bolshevism, others had
joined the opposing forces. Their Ataman
Semeonoff had collected a band of men whom
the promise of rich loot had attracted. He
proclaimed himself the defender of Siberia;
yet to maintain his army he requisitioned
food, money, horses and cattle from the
peasants, and when they resisted his de-
mands he sent punitive detachments which
spread terror and death in the villages.
Peasants began to desert their homes and
went to live in. the forests, from whose
strongholds they waged ruthless war with
their enemies, whoever they happened to be.
Makar still clung to his, property, though
apart from the land and the house there
was little left. With deep
sorrow 7 he watched his country
falling into ruin. Of the glori-
ous promise of Liberty and
Fraternity there was not a
semblance, and the gaols were
full to overflowing. Only
Equality remained; for were
not they all in equal danger of
their lives? People were afraid
to speak even to their best
friends lest they should be be-
trayed. One could no longer
say of anyone with certainty,
“This man is my friend.”
At last the" thought came to
Makar to join the Bolsheviks.
His defenders had robbed him
of most of the wealth he pos-
sessed, and their disregard for
Russia and the people filled him
with disgust and rage. While
poor Cossacks were joining the
punitive forces, expecting to
get rich at the expense of the
wealthy, he saw the well-to-do
entering the armies of the Reds
to fight against these bandits.
Avdotya listened in silence when Makar
told her of his thought. She had never
opposed Makar’s wish before, but now
things were different.
“What about me?” she asked, and Makar
realised the hopelessness of her position.
Itussia had no more use for old women. They
could not shoulder a gun and were consum-
ing food which the armies required.
‘'But what can I do?” Makar asked. “Can
I remain calm when everything we possess
is being taken from us? Am I not a man
and a Cossack?” Yet Avdotya knew that
Makar would suffer greatly before he left
her.
Now Semeonoff’s troops were taking away
Makar’s last horse; and when Makar remon-
strated, a soldier struck him in the face,
felling him. That was the end. The old
man rose slowly, his grey beard dyed with
blood. Just as slowly he went into the
house. There he prayed before the Ikons,
and when night came he kissed his wife and,
armed with his old gun, went into the forest.
Avdotya, dry-eyed, watched him go, and
stared into the night. When dawn came,
she saw the empty room, the untouched bed,
and realisation of her loneliness came to
her. She felt a sharp pain in her heart
as if somebody was stabbing her.
It was August, 1918. The Bolshevik
armies received orders to evacuate Irkutsk.
They had already lost the greater part of
Siberia; now they retreated behind the
Baikal Mountains, only thus escaping from
the ring which the Czechs and the Siberian
troops were preparing for them.
The Czechoslovaks had crossed the moun-
tains, pursuing the Reds. The forest re-
sounded to shooting and the cries ot men.
The little squirrel and booroondook went
higher up the mountains to escape the fury.
After every battle, Makar anxiously scru-
tinised tire* faces of the prisoners, and with
fear searched amongst the dead enemies,
always expecting to see his son amongst them.
But no word came of either Avdotya or
Trophim.
One bright morning rain had fallen and
the green leaves looked bright. With an-
other soldier Makar went into the forest
to gather wild berries. They filled their
caps and sat under a tree enjoying the
spoil. The war was forgotten. It seemed
to Makar he was a boy again roaming
near his village. Then he saw himself as
a youth sitting under a tree waiting for
Avdotya, and when her colored sarafan
was glimpsed through the trees he ran to
meet her.
“It’s good here, Otetz [father],” said the
younger soldier, and Makar was brought
back to earth.
“Very good,” he agreed, “so peaceful”;
and before he had time to finish liis sentence
Czechoslovaks stood before him, their
bayonets glittering in the morning sun.
The two prisoners were led over the hill,
and brought before an officer who sat on
a camp-stool writing.
“Prisoners, your Excellency,” announced
a soldier, and without turning his head,
and not being even aware of the number
of prisoners, the commander said: “Use the
machine-gun.” :! ‘
Makar heard the sentence, and something
like a smile came to his face.
The two men stood waiting; apparently
the order to use the machine-gun was delay-
ing the execution.
Makar heard strange noises issuing from
the throat of his fellow-prisoner.
“Good-bye, Otetz,” he was saying through
his sobs. “If ever I have offended thee,
forgive me.”
Makar turned round, and, embracing the
man, kissed him three times.
“The Lord will forgive thee, my son. I
have nothing against thee.”
The soldier flung his hands around Makar’s
neck, kissing him.
Makar thought of Avdotya and a soft
feeling possessed him. He could see her
old and lonely, waiting for his return.
Then he thought of Barboska, the dog.
His reflections were interrupted by the
arrival of the gun, and a young man came
and stood near it.
Makar stared bewildered. He did not
believe that life could play. him such a
cruel joke.
“Otetz! Otetz!” he heard the young man
cry, and the next instant Trophim was
kneeling before his father.
There was commotion in the ranks of
the Czechoslovak soldiers who had come
to see the execution. Somebody shouted
about calling the commander, another spoke
of treason.
“Get up, my son,” Makar said calmly,
laying his hand on his son’s head. “Go and
do your duty, Trophim. You are a Cossack
and a soldier.”
Trophim rose, trembling. He searched his
father’s face.
“Go, Trophim; thou must not die as well.
Thy mother is waiting at home. She has
need of thee.”
Trophim turned towards the gun. A feel-
ing of pride swelled in Makar’s heart.
There was a crackling sound and a shower
of bullets hit the two men. For some seconds
Makar stood swaying like a tree shaken
by a storm. Then he fell face down, his
hand clutching the dry grass as if in his
last moment he wanted to touch his native
soil.
The tall trees whispered in their tops,
softly, faintly
“Liberty, Equality, Fraternity!”

A Chamber of Death
FOR YOUR PROTECTION
Let us tell you what
happens inside the
“Chamber of Death”
used in testing Fly*
tox. Into this lethal
chamber are placed
100 ordinary flies.
Through small open'
ings a chemist sprays
a small quantity of
Fly'tox. Almost in-
stantaneously the flies
are affected. Five min'
utes later they should
all be down on their
backs— dead. To prove that
they are dead, they are gather-
ed up and placed in an incub-
ator for 24 hours, when res-
ults are checked. If any of the
flies show signs of life the batch
of Fly-tox used in the test
is held back until it is made
100% efficient. This thorough-
ness means the difference be-
tween potency and impotency.

Odysseus.
I HAVE come back as a stone falls to
earth.
I have come back from the loneliness of
the world
To the sunlit hills and meadows that gave
me birth.
My heart is a ship, and all her sails aie
furled.
I have grown old in the wilderness of the
seas;
I have felt the world slipping from under
my feet;
But now I am home at last where the olive-
trees
Sleep in the silver dusk, and the flowers
are sweet.
For though the heart grow desolate, though
it roam
For ever in vain the ways of earth, in
quest
Of high and lovely things, yet it comes
home
In the end to the waiting arms, and finds
its rest.
But I shall hear in dreams the sea that
swirls
About those hungry rocks, and the wild
gulls’ cries;
And always I’ll remember the singing girls—
The pale beseeching hands, and the pitiful
eyes.

Dream Songs.
STOLEN from the summer’s spoil,
Woven from a golden dream,
Threads of gossamer I win
From the satin silk-worm’s toil;
Filmy tapestries I spin,
Worked with amethysts aglearn.
Here the petal of a flower,
Dew from out the scarlet rose,
Dust from off the grey moth’s wings,
Purple from the violet’s dower
Where the linnet sits and sings
Of the fields its freedom knows.
Honey from the foxglove’s bells,
Gold from off the flowering broom,
Silver from the moonbeam's store,
Silence where the morning tells
To the eve its magic lore
In the land of lotus-bloom.
Diamonds from the flashing spray,
Rarer gems of fireflies born,
Motes that dance upon the sight,
Flowers that bud and pass away,
Rainbow gleams that dimly light
Fairy lattices at morn.
And from these I weave a song
Spun from out a web of dreams,
Bubble songs that float and fall,
Tunes that pipe the wind along,
Vines that burgeon on the wall,
On the fond, familiar themes.

Vouth and Age.
HERE upon my height
1 have a lamp and oil,
And flame will come at my bidding; but
the water
Will not boil.
I have glory and a prospect,
And a charmSd air,
But what are these to the glory of eyes,
And lips and hair?
A wider prospect
Man never saw.
But behind the law that bids water boil
Lurks another law.

The Echo.
EVEN the soundless rain
Holds echo of your name,
And every wind that blows
Faint, or in volume grows,
Tells and re-tells the same
Half-bitter, pain.
Even the stars that turn
In that far numbness burn
With remote force that breathes
The same message as the leaves
Whose shuffle on the ground
Is a name’s whispered sound.
And each minutest thing
Is a dark beating wing
Whose rhythm in my breast
Tells, without pause or rest,
Only that half-breathed pain,
The echo of a name.
MAORILAND. UNA CURRIE.
In a Limousine.
OF what did they dream as they drove
in the tumbrils,
Bumping over the Paris cobbles, creaking
up the Gascony hills?
Coolly smiling, their eyes ; their faces serene
and untroubled,
Till the mad throngs, stung to red fury,
shrill insults redoubled!
Nor even scorn did they show, nor by a
motion
Knew the shrieks in their ears for either
hate or devotion.
Of what did they dream? Of courtly man-
ners and dances,
Of .stately homes and Versailles and silk-
soft glances?
Of the kiss of gold-flecked crystal on lips
cherry-smooth and rosy?
Of hands that held red roses in a filigree-
banded posy?
Of panelled rooms and perfumes and high
candles of white wax
And their lights on powdered tresses and
satin-smooth backs ?
Of the white drooping shoulders of women
slim-handed and melodic-voiced
In starlit, high-walled gardens where rain-
fountains rejoiced?
Of night’s red roses of pleasure, of days glad
as a lark’s song—
Of what did they dream as the tumbrils
rumbled along?
Oh., eager of hand and avid of eye were we
to tear them asunder,
To tear the dream from their brain, to add
to our rabble plunder,
Eager to rend to ribbons the masks of un-
heeding faces.
For flesh of them, bone of them, were the
generations’ stored graces!
Always I see that vision, the serene, the mob
and the tumbril,
When my limousine shoots like a star through
streets that the workers fill.
How far am I from him of the kennels who
cursed from the mire and the slush
The high, unseeing gaze neither rage nor
insult might crush?
I have wealth and power as great as they
ever knew—yes, and doubled—
Yet I know my gaze is shifting, my face is
troubled.
When appraising eyes flash into mine, am I
cringing 5ti11?....
Of what did they dream as they drove in
the tumbril ?

Between the houses;
And, where the lissom bamboos meet,

Like breath of Oberon, the air
So faintly taken.
Dear One, asleep, lies unaware,
And does not waken.
The sprig of Life! To see her now,
With eyelids folded,
Who’d guess, if I said “When?” or
“How?”. ...
Well, I’d be scolded !

In Absence.
T WRITE to tell you that your hills are
I green;
Green with a shining mist, a silken rain;
Tenderly, fairily green. The magic stain
Spreads from the brimming dells an upward
sheen
Of purest color. There the dawn has been,
Breathing an incantation on the grass ; ,
There blooms the silver music of the stars,
Lingeringly translated —I have seen
Shower and sun upon your grassy ways,
And felt your wonder. In such chill,
sweet air
Miracles have been wrought, and I would
dare
Invade the paths you knew in kindlier days
To seek you, praying humbly as one prays
For light that some day I may find you
there.

Glowing wing:
Black and gold that does hold
Every exquisite thing!
Not a note,
Lovely bird ;
Not a note from your throat
Breaking forth have I heard.
Not a sound !
But I sigh
N0t.... A sound would confound
This sweet joy of the eye.
All the gold
’Neath the sun ;
Ail the gold that’s unsold
To your beauty is won.
Gold and all
Lovely things;
Gold and all festival
Gathered fast in your wings.
Lovely bird,
From your tree,
Lovely bird, you have stirred;
You go fearful from me!
Flashing out
Through the trees;
Flashing out; and about
Me these clean memories.
As you went—
In a flash—
As you went, when I’ve spent
This poor bodily trash,
Even so
From the earth,
Even so may I go
To the beautiful birth.

The Forsaken Garden.
ONCE a man lived and breathed
Who loved this spot;
His whole life did but serve
To dress his plot;
But now his garden’s lost
And he forgot.
Where once his cowslips bloomed
Coarse grasses spread,
And where his lawns were laid
The sorrel’s red;
Of garden naught remains
And he is dead.

Rain Dancing.
THE merry rain was dancing
In a fine crystal gown,
Upon a yellow hillside,
Above a little town.
Bright grasses clapped their green
hands
With shy sylvan delight;
A cloud of amber bees thrummed
With all their elfin might.
A frog in emerald doublet,
Squatted upon a stone,
With quaint deliberation
Blew on his saxophone.
A bluebird sang a small song
From a clematis bower;
The vagabond wind-fingered
His lute a silver hour.
A rabbit stepped a measure
Sedately at his door.
And crickets in the tussocks
Piped thinly o’er and o’er.
And not a soul in that town
To door or window went
To watch the small rain dancing
In bright abandonment.

BEND over me in your black dress of

Drop on me poppy-petals from your hair,
Deep golden petals, petals orange-tawny,
Lustrous like taffeta you sometimes wear.
Shed round me all the scented love and
darkness
Of your black, streaming, kindly-shadow-
ing hair.
"Within its folds two petals from a poppy —
Oh, love, the river and you by me there !
The river, tawny-gold beneath the sunset,
Meeting the blackness of the distant shore,
Bend close to me your breasts that ’neatli
the velvet
Swell in a softness I shall touch no more.
I go into a darkness like your velvet,
Like the enshrouding darkness of your
hair,
And there your kiss, your hands, are un-
remembered,
And never falls a poppy petal there.
But he who once has seen your strength and
beauty,
The glory of your soul, can meet despair,
And, knowing you, can laughing dare all
sorrow,
Even the absence of your hands and hair.

BEYOND the half-heart hands of my

Mocking my captive ears with clamorous
cries?
O leave, my sullen dreamings ! Set me free
From these so torturing fantasies, and
fall
Beneath the veils of passionless memory,
And let them then for ever be your pall!
I see your white breasts heaving on the
waves;
I hear your voice through midnight’s start-
ing air,
And wheresoe’er my errant fancy raves
You follow daintily to mock me there;
Thus do we waste in Hell until we share
The wise eternity of parted graves.

Fear.
LAST night, as I lay down alone,
I was afraid. Why should I fear
This pleasant house that I have known
Since my young mother bore me here?
Last night familiar things were strange,
Strange as dear faces turned to death;
Yet still, in a more dreadful change,
Re-quickened by some aw’ful Breath ;
And there pressed on me in the night
Terrors that had been long removed;
I was afraid of the moon’s light,
I was afraid of all I loved.
Outside, upon the shadowed grass,
A while before the dawn was there,
I heard some quiet footsteps pass.
I do not know whose feet they were;
And yet I think that I shall hear
Those footsteps come, and not pass by.
And I shall know again that fear,
An hour before I die.
.Tesu, grant me! though I dread
Demons that in the darkness move,
When that I lie on my death-bed
Let me not fear the things I love!

LUCRETIA of the steady hand,
Pour out the red, red wine of death!
O white witch-tliing, at Lust's command,
Fools for their folly lose their breath.
Fair Circe, stir the potion well!
Drop in the herbs! The rune begin !
Pink-fingered, weave the wild, green spell!
Heroes are only men in sin.
But, as for me, Hate turns the key.
And Love is mad. Dark hell-bells ring.
Scorn does not mate with Sorcery.
How cokl lie lies! How swift knives sting!

Unwisdom.
LOVE me, though in small measure, that
among
Earth’s harvest-company of glee who press
Through carefree joyance, jostling fetterless,
We may be alwmys admirably young—
Not as my heart urges and my tongue
Betrayed by yearning for more tenderness,
Firmer and growing deeper to assess
While fragrant years twine upward rung on
rung;
But as a voice directs from that dark pool,
r ine uncertain spirit long obscured by trash,
Where dwells perhaps dank wisdom stiff with
scales,
Telling us it were best to take the cool
Pathway of surface, since all fire is ash
And faithfulness and trust so many tales.
Dear, it would not in any way be wise
For you to love me more than as a whim
Pleases the heart a moment or as dim
Shadows of fancy dance before the eyes;
For Love that seemed smooth laughter eager
to rise
Struts like a tyrant merciless and grim
Over the desolate land surrendered him,
When he has no more need for gay disguise;
And you had best remember that I hail
From no sane country granaried with increase
Where men are reasoned, constant, single-
willed,
But am of the moon’s children, they who fail
In all set purposes, who break their peace
Following faiths foredoomed and unfulfilled.

Lightness.
OH light of foot my lady treads,
So fairy-formed is she.
All delicate the air of her
And sunny the bright hair of her,
So dancing-light her little feet that are so
swift and free,
That they could tread on petals soft and
leave no print to see.
Oh light of heart my lady sings
As through the world she goes,
A song with love for part of it
And laughter at the heart of it,
A song as slight and delicate as any falling
rose
The wind might blow against her mouth.
No other song she knows.
Oh light of love my lady seems —
Would Love had spared me this!
Rut dear with all delight is she,
So gay and fair and bright is she....
If she knew but one lover then how much
would others miss!
Yet, lady-light-of-love, I found deep passion
in your kiss.

CARRY YOUTH
WITH YOU
ALWAYS
To every woman over twenty-five, sooner or later, comes
the dread of fading youth—the unsightliness of dis-
figuring wrinkles.
The strenuous conditions of modern life, the natural
process of advancing years, the hard dust-laden air to
which the face is daily exposed—all these contribute to
the destruction of youthful bloom, woman s most
cherished and priceless possession.
Yet, just as nature has created these very conditions, so
has she, through the medium of the chemist, made
available the simple though long-sought remedies that
will remove wrinkles and restore to women of mature
years the charming freshness of a lovely skin.
Dorothy Manners’ Beauty Treatments, which are identical
with those used in the exclusive salons of Pans, London
and New York, are now available to all women in their
own homes. Every woman over twenty-five should have
these infallible aids to beauty. Women every day are
learning quickly how just a few minutes nightly skin
care revives and preserves their natural beauty and gives
them many more years of youth.
MAKE THIS TEST FOR YOURSELF —
Take your mirror to the bright light at your window: see how
much older is the skin of your face and neck compared with that
of your shoulders. Worry and weather make your face years
older than you are, years older than you feel.
Dorothy Manners’ treatments smooth away wrinkles and age
lines, banish sallowness, and bring new, healthful, charming
beauty overnight.
Just a few minutes every night, first to cleanse, next to nourish

The Penitent.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
THE snow party was ending.
It had lasted for a night and a
day, and now the dawn of another day
was near, and all but Jim Viryllon (pro-
fessionally Mr. Viryllon, evangelist) were
worn out. Mr. Viryllon had slept no more
and eaten no more than the others; but his
physical strength and nervous energy were
unconquerable. For fifty hours Viryllon
and Les Belper, who lived with (and on)
his aunt; Maisie Galant and her young
sister Nell, with whom Les was infatuated
for the moment; and Dr. yon I’rokis, famed
for his readiness to help ladies in trouble, had
been alternately drunk and sober, under the
spell of cocaine, and agonisingly in need of it.
During this period the party had acquired,
no one knew exactly how or when, a lugu-
brious taxi-driver named Fred, who had lost
his taxi ; an anonymous middle-aged woman
with vermilion hair and only one shoe; and
Cecil, a tall, fair, prancing boy with a black
eye who had twice bounded out for cocaine
when the need was sorest and had miracu-
lously returned with it. With these rein-
forcements the party had- wandered from
bar to bar all day, and from flat to. flat
all night; sometimes welcomed, sometimes
rebuffed, sometimes hilarious, sometimes
lachrvmose; at one moment full of goodwill
towards the world, at the next racked with
lacerating suspicions of their nearest and
dearest. They had been persuaded, led and
thrown out of hotels, cursed at from win-
dows, moved on. from street corners, and
threatened with arrest by the police. At
one stage the police had acted. They re-
called with cloudy resentment that long, long
ago two friends who had begun the celebration
with them had been dragged shrieking away.
Izzy Moscowitch and his young lady. Some-
thing to do with flashing a knife. That was
before Cecil Whatevcr-his-namc-was had
been given the shiner by the Pommy sailor
for claiming to know the Prince of Wales.
And now the binge, like so many of Life’s
glorious experiments, was coming to a flat end.
Les Belper, who had been asleep on a
sofa, sat up and looked around him. He
was in the sitting-room of an ornate flat.
On the floor was a little pool of blood.
Driblets of the stuff led like tiny stepping-
stones to the bathroom. He could hear the
owner of the flat, who had been hit on the
nose by Cecil, calling to them from the
bathroom to.go away, as his wife was com-
ing back from the country that morning.
This squib, whom none of them knew, but
who said he was a reputable solicitor,
seemed to have lost his nerve on finding the
red-haired woman undressed and unconscious
in his wife’s bed.
Les raised his throbbing eyes from the
stained, glass-strewn carpet; they rested on
young Nell. She was asleep in a deep chair.
Viryllon was sitting on an arm looking
down at her. Tears were in his eyes, and
he had taken out his pocket Bible. Les
recognised the symptoms. Remorse had set
in. Religion was in possession, and for
months to come he would denounce sin_ with
the enthusiasm of a convert and the inside
LINE CLEAR.
“Why the green lipstick?"
“Oh, I’m going out with a railway man to-night."
and lip to elate information of a practitioner.
What, Les asked himself, did the girls see
in this fat-lipped, pasty-faced, pig-eyed per-
son? He only had to unloose one of those
slow, wid i smiles of his and get his boom-
ing, loud-speaker voice to work and they
fell for him, as Nell had done. Les rose
shakily and looked at himself in a glass.
He saw a flat, black head, narrow, brown
eyes, delicate features, small white teeth.
Admirers had said his face was good enough
for the movies. Yet this big Bible-banger,
who was practically an old man —thirty-five
if he was a day—had cut him out with Nell
half an hour after meeting her.
On a sudden impulse he walked over to
his rival, and hit him feebly on the side of
the head. Viryllon was as harmless now
as* he was terrible when the legions of Satan
were in possession.
“Wazzer marrer, Les?” he inquired mildly,
and rubbed his ear. “Wazzat for?”
Les steadied himself, pursed his thin lips
to express relentlessness, took _ careful
aim at the apostle’s benevolent; right eye,
and hit him a terrific blow on the 3aw.
Viryllon slid to the floor.
Nell’s childish blue eyes opened; she lifted
a trembling little hand to her mop of fair hair,
and peered in a troubled maimer over the
edge of the chair. . .
“■See him,” said Les pointing spaciously
at his victim. “Thasser sorter man I am.
He pursed his lips menacingly. “Do it to
vou, too, if you say much more.”
After gazing at Viryllon for a second or two
in jealous fury, lie kicked him resoundingly
in the stomach. Without deigning to bestow
another word or look on Nell he then strode
buoyantly from the flat and into the street.
A faint, rosy light was stealing over the
city from behind the Heads. He walked
towards it, the street rising and falling in
slow waves before him, and presently found
a bench near the still waters of the harbor.
He slumped down on it to think things out.
The party had been an interlude, entered
on to enable him to forget his troubles for
a time. Now his troubles had to be faced,
and something done about them. He knew
quite well what he was going to do.
He was broke. It was not a matter of
finding a tenner or so, or even a hundred.
MUSICAL INSTRUMENTS ILLUSTRATED—NO. 1: THE JEW’S HARP.
He needed the best part of seven hundred.
His aunt, whose silly, sanctimonious, lov-
ing ways made him boil with hatred every
time he saw or thought of her, had a weak
heart. But, just as he had formed what
appeared to be well-grounded hopes that
she might pop off any day, she had come
back from a specialist with the news, that,
if she took care of herself and experienced
no shocks or strains or excitements, she
might live for years.
It was not till then that he had thought
of .Toe Ruddle. Joe had done one or two
basher jobs for him at cut rates. He had
been in a strong bargaining position as
regards Joe ever since his chance discovery
of the part played by the basher in the
Gotha Garage fire, which had resulted
in a night watchman being burned to
death. Joe was
brainless, unedu-
cated, full of half-
wi 11 e d supersti-
tions, without a
trade, an unem-
ployable ; but he
was cunning, and
he had a sort of
murderous courage.
An ideal basher.
He more or less
lived on the game.
Les leant back
on the bench and
lit a cigarette. He
watched the great
summer sun blaze
up over Sou t'h
Head, faced the
cool breath of the
rising nor’-easter,
and for the first
time in weeks felt
comforted. H i s
plan was made,
and it was flaw-
less. Joe was dark
and about his own
height and build.
He would get him
a duplicate key of
the flat, and he could hash the old woman
at liis convenience. Round about midnight,
after the servant had gone, would be best.
Anyone who saw Joe going in or out would
think it was himself. But he would be at a
mountain hotel eighty miles away; he would
leave the morning before, and not get back
till the evening after the event. And he
would make sure that many people knew his
movements.
He didn’t know how much money she had,
but it was bound to be a good deal, and she
had said lie was to get most of it. H hat
a future he had before him! Re would
marry young Nell, take her to Hollywood,
go into the movies—become a star, he
shouldn’t wonder.
He interrupted these pleasant musings to
consider how much he ought to pay Joe.
Not more than a fiver, he decided. For one
thing lie couldn’t get more, and for another
he didn't mean to w 7 arn Joe of the probable
result of his work. Joe would think it was
an ordinary basher job, for revenge or some-
thing ; the only effect of offering him big
money would be to make him get suspi-
cious and ask for more.
He arrived at the slum cottage where
Joe lived with half a dozen friends—arrived
just as the fools who know nothing of
the pleasures enjoyed by men of leisure-
like Joe —were pouring into town. His
nerves were on edge, the roof of. his skull.
rose and fell spasmodically, his empty
stomach was flattened excruciatingly against
his backbone; lie was beginning to feel
that if he could not reach some dark place
soon cover up his head and sleep he would
go mad. But he had to settle with Joe
first There were all sorts of times —h n-
days, the 13tli of the month, the full of the
moon—when Joe was afraid to work. _
A foul-smelling foreigner showed him into
a carpetless room, with playing-cards lying
about a beer-stained deal table, and indi-
cated a chair. “Joe’s asleep,” he said with
slow indifference.
With a desperate effort Les repressed a
desire to scream the importance of his. mis-
sion in the man’s sullen face. Impatiently
In* pushed out of the room and along the
passage to a bedroom where he found Joe
lying on liis back fully dressed.
“Get up,” he shouted. “I want you to
come out.”
Joe turned over on his face with a groan.
“Say what you’ve got to say here,” he said.
“I’m crook.”
“Get up, I say!”
“No one can hear.”
But Les was taking no chances. He
had thought his scheme out well, and it was
going to be carried through according to plan.
“Come on,” he ordered in shaking tones.
“Come out into the street. You’ve got to,
blast yer!”
Joe received his instructions under a blank
wall, with no outsider near. He was willing to
do the job, but wanted the money beforehand.
Les was distracted. “I haven’t got it,”
he whispered tensely. “I’ll have it after-
wards. Look here, wait till afterwards and
I’ll give you seven.”
“That’s no good to me. Last time you never
paid me till you wanted the next cove blued.”
“I haven't got it, I tell you. It’s God’s
truth, I haven’t.”
“Pinch some of the old lady’s housekeep-
ing money. You done it before.”
* * * *
And so Les came into his aunt’s money.
Or, rather, a solicitor arranged to tide him
over the time between her funeral and the
distribution of her estate. His creditors
changed abruptly from
truculence to affabil-
ity. He bought the
car which his late
relative had meanly
denied him. Nell,
who had been repelled
with loathing by the
evangelist, crawled
back full of abject
apologies. He pro-
m i s e d that when
everything was settled
they wmuld be mar-
ried—with the mental
reservation that in a
very short time he was
going to turn her down
as hard as he knew
how. It made him
smile, w’hen they were
together and she was
fawning on him, to
think of the jolt she
would get when he gave
her her richly-earned
marching orders.
Meanwhile, all was
well otherwise.
The newspapers
were beginning to lose
interest in the mys-
terious attack on an
old lady who, as all
agreed, was without
an enemy in the
wrnrld. The police
were baffled. Every-
thing went to suggest
that their old friend
Les was guilty, ex-
cept the physical im-
possibility of his being-
guilty.
Les booked a pas-
sage to San Francisco,
and, having booked it,
began another binge.
It was a stormy night. Yet so great
were the drawing powers of Mr. Viryllou
that the city hall which he had taken for
his farewell meetings was overflowing.
In rich, organ-like tones he told of the
Devil’s manoeuvres to secure him. But he
had fought the good fight; he had gone over
the top against the massed battalions ot
Hell as and when required, and though
sorely stricken —aye, beaten at times to the
Very' earth —he had eventually triumphed ;
and with the help of his heavenly Captain
would do so to the end.
Dropping his voice to a less arrogant note
he told in some detail of backslidings which
had brought him to the brink of the Pit.
The demon Drink, aware of his failing, had
tempted him with delicious beverages, and,
like the weakest of those present, he had
exceeded. Lovely women, the shock troops
of Beelzebub’s bodyguard, had displayed their
charms, and he had fallen. Always, how-
ever, he had won free in the end, and, when
attacked by the unregenerate for so doing,
had turned the other cheek, lie mentioned
gloomily that the last time he had obeyed
heavenly orders in this respect he had sus-
tained a broken jaw.
Near him was a kind of Greek chorus of
women, mostly well stricken in years, who
acclaimed his triumphs and lamented his
reverses.
Most of his confidences were familiar, but
repetition made them no less soul-disturb
ing. Soon his magnetism and their emotion
roused the audience. An immense sailor —
a Swede or Dane, by his accent —sprang to
his feet. His great red face was working
convulsively, tears of remorse were stream-
ing down his cheeks. Women had been his
bane. He gave lamentable accounts of his
doings in Yokohama and Port Said, Mar-
seilles and Port-au-Prince. White, black,
yellow—all had come alike to him. Edified
but embarrassed officials soothed him into
tearful silence, and his place at the penitent
form was taken by a less romantic figure.
This sinner’s weakness was “snow-dropping”
—pinching washing off clothes-lines. He had
stolen thousands and thousands of garments;
every “fence” in the State knew him, and so
did the Judges and jolins. He had been in five
gaols and sixteen lockups. But never again!
Not if all the washing in Australia was
flaunted unguarded before his eyes wo. id he
so much as raise a finger. He was through;
he was finished with wrong-doing for ever
and ever. He had heard the words of hope
and glory, and Satan’s chance of dragging
him down to the never-dying flames of Perdi-
tion was gone.
At the back of the hall stood another man,
cold, wet and slightly drunk, and shivered
at the reflection that by the merest fluke he
had been shown the way to escape eternal
damnation. He had not been to a mission
before, and had only come to this one to
escape the rain. If these coves were right—
and they had education, and so ought to
know —one who did certain things was
settled ; doomed to everlasting fire. Things
like boozing, knocking about with girls and
pinching clothes. With a spasm of terror
he realised how trivial such offences were
by comparison with his.
The snow-dropper was at it again:
“Though my sins be as black as Hell —which
they are —they shall be washed away, leav-
ing me pure. I am saved !”
The man at the back pushed frantically
at him in front of him. “So am I.” he cried,
“Hallelujah ! Praise the Lord !” intoned
the venerable chorus.
The new convert faced the crowd. Mixed
with his repentance was an exhilarating
pride. He was going to show them what a
dinkum sinner was like. A glorious sense
of superiority—the first he had known in
all his frustrated life —gave him words and
confidence.
“Friends!” he shouted, “I’m a bigger
sinner than any of yous. I’m the biggest
sinner in the world.” He paused to savor
the exquisite thrill of confession. “I’m a
murderer. Yes, I’ve done in more than one
in my time.” The agitated whispering, the
moving of heads, the silence of the ladies who
had applauded his predecessors, infuriated him.
They thought he was skiting, did they ! “I’ll
prove it,” he howled. “Remember the old
woman what was bashed in the flat? I done
it. Dressed up like ’er young nephew I was.
’Ere’s ’is clothes I’m wearing now. ’Ere s

of heavy feet. The convert’s arm was gripped
by a strong hand.
“Come on, Joe,” said the voice of the law.

To a Hotel Pillow.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
O PILLOW, dusty, fusty, old,
What generations of strange heads
Have dropped where here thou liest bold!
And now comes mine,
The last of that long line!
Once thou wast young and fresh and plump ;
Thy covers tip to tip were filled
Till kapok make a decent hump !
Now thou art flat
As some old sat-on hat.
Once on thy curves a neck could resL
A head find eminence upon
Thy swelling front as on a breast.
Alas, that so
Much splendor had to go!
I shake thee out, I fold thee round,
I double thee, I end thee up,
And still no comfort can be found
For my poor head
Where thou mak’st mock of bed!
In Old Japan, so travellers say,
A block of wood a pillow makes,
And this, as ages fade away,
Is polished by
The necks that on it lie.
And, as the generations pass,
More hon’rable by its age it grows
In human eyes. But thou, alas!
What honor Can
Be given thee by man!
Dusty, fusty, musty, old, '
Flat as a Shrovc-tide pancake ere
Its ductile sweetness has been rolled,
Thou are time’s last,
Lone derelict, upcast!
Now flaccid on the sea of bed
Thou liest prone; with every wave
That left thee, flattened out —a head
That dropped its weight
Upon thy hapless state.
And now come I to thee, a poor
Tired unit of a weary world,
Hoping that thou mightst sleep ensure
(In spite of facts!)
Where thy dim dust contracts!

[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
MR. McINTYRE paused at the head of
the gangway, frowningly regarded the
burly carrier who was shouldering “a
heavy sea-chest to a pulsating ‘lorry upon
the quay, then turned to wave a'Threatening
finger at Captain Billy Framm, of the s.s.

departure with amusement.
“Ah canna say but whit Ah agree wi’ the
owners that the Megina has had her day,
Mr. Framm. Ah seempathize wi’ them, in
their streenuous effairts tae secure cairgo

“You’re taking a lot for granted, Mr.

of his lip.
“Ah’ve been wi’ the Malloring line for
twinty-five year’, Mr. Framm, an’ in all that

Mr. Framm grinned. “Getting squeamish
in your old age, Mac?” he asked.
“Whin a wuckit mon tairneth frae bees

ineequity, an’ doeth that
which” began Mr. Mc-
Intyre piously.
“An’ where d’you think
you’ll get another ship, Mr.
Mclntyre?” asked the other
sharply. “A deserting engi-
neer isn’t generally sought
after —even if he is the only
one of his kind who can
make a cylinder out of an
oil-drum.”
“The Laird will provide,
Mr. Framm,” replied Mr.
Mclntyre, severely.
“Well, I don’t know which
shipping office you'll find
Him in, Mr. Mclntyre,” re-
torted Mr. Framm.
Mr. Mclntyre glared in-
dignantly at Mr. Framm,
then descended the gangway
with overpowering dignity.
“G oo d afternoon , Mr.
Mclntyre,” called Mr.
Framm, as the engineer
stepped on to the quay/.
“Guid -lye, Mr. Framm.
An’ may the Laird bring ye
a change o’ liairt.”
It was the end of a fort-
night’s argument, and Mr.
Framm watched the elderly,
upright engineer, as lie strode away, with
a thoughtful frown. Must be darned un-
comfortable having a conscience which
asserted itself at the most inconvenient
moments, he mused; you never knew
where you were; and that Mac’s con-
science should start in business in oppo-
sition to Mac’s pocket was the last
thing one might have expected. But there
it was! After going into figures and arrang-
ing details, after having decided latitude and
longitude and the 1 nature of the breakdown,
Mac had been suddenly afflicted with fe&rs
for his immortal soul! He had galloped
away to his cabin and stuck pins between
the leaves of his Bible, unearthing texts
which pointed out the error of his ways—
even into the words “His mother’s name
also was Jerusbah” lie had read a Divine
threat! He had spent fruitless hours enlarg-
ing upon the dire consequences, which would
surely follow so heinous a crime, and had
pleaded for repentance ere it was too late.
But he hadn’t made any threats of dis-
closure until now, neither had he been, able
to suggest a method of keeping the ship at
sea in the absence of cargo ; and what with
this confounded shipping strike, higher
wages, and one thing and another....
“Old Mac has actually gone, then?” ex-
claimed the first officer, who had drifted to
the gangway, and was staring in surprise
at the retreating figure of the engineer.
Captain Framm smiled bitterly. “He’s
gone all right, Mr. Smart,” lie replied shortly.
“Can’t understand what’s 1 biting him. Let’s
THE PERFECT SPECIMEN.
“Flo’s boy seems a steady, reliable sort.”
“Yes, he’s so honest, Flo says, he won’t even take a hint.”
hope the feller they’re sending us isn't so
confoundedly argumentative.”
The engineer who was “quite all right”
(having been out of a berth for nearly a year
on account of his deplorable habit of forget-
ting his ship in the delights of shore life),
came up the gangway later in the afternoon,
and introduced himself as Mr. Cromwell.
Mr. Oliver Cromwell, of Adelaide; no rela-
tion to the illustrious general of that name,
he thanked the Lord, but an Australian
first, last and all the time ; and whoever had
the temerity to wish to dispute that fact
was invited to forthwith step forward and
receive conviction by the singular process of
having his head knocked off! As none
doubted his word, he followed Captain
Framm meekly to the chief engineer’s cabin,
climbed into the bunk on his fourth attempt,
pulled the pillow over his head, and stertor-
ously commenced to sleep off the effects of
his celebration.
“Pretty hard citizen, sir,” commented Mr.
Smart; “I don’t like the look of him.”
“I wish you’d tell him so, Mr. Smart,”
replied Captain Framm tartly.
The next day the s.s. Megina cleared for
Valparaiso, and there was a volcanic atmo-
sphere in the engine-room. With the neg-
ligible exception of a headache, Mr. Crom-
well had completely recovered his usual
buoyant health, and he surged around in
the depths of the ship with a turbulent
vigor only to be expected of one who finds*
himself in command after a nine months’
spell. He whistled shrilly and monotonously
as he climbed about the stamping engines
with a gigantic spanner in his hand, and he
rapidly assumed the grimed and dishevelled
appearance of a man who is lost to the
world in the eager following of iiis heart s
desire.
His crew could find much to admire in
him when he balanced himself upon a pre-
carious foothold and strove to eliminate some
chronic wheeze with a spanner or an oil-
can ; but when he descended amongst them
and drew their attention to the many things
which they had learned to leave undone in
the old Megina, and emphasised his remarks
with comprehensive profanity and an occa-
sional blow, they charitably hoped that lie
would some day, very soon, fall into a crank-
pit and be forgotten. Had his stature and
physique been less than they were, perhaps
some brighter spirit might have been moved
to assist him to this end ; but, as things were,
the donkeyman christened him the Great
Australian Bite, and the name stuck.
There was never any doubt of the Bite’s
knowledge of his craft, and the clanking con-
traptions which passed for engines in the
ancient Megina responded cordially to the
respectful tenderness with which he treated
their advanced age. They shed much of
their rheumatism under his skilled hands,
and their step became considerably more
youthful Their lungs improved and their
breathing became less noisy, and their brass
and steel faces shone with their early
lustre. In fact, they grew so jaunty in
their new-found health that they adde
another two knots to the speed of the snip,
and induced a puzzled frown upon the broad
visage of Captain Billy Framm.
The Megina was a day’s run due east of
the North Cape of New Zealand when Cap-
tain Framm had a word with Mr. Cromwell,
lie had hoped that the improvement in ihe
engines was a last brilliant rally before
inevitable collapse; but, as every day across
the Tasman had been marked by a constant
and steady growth in power and speed, he
was seriously perturbed.
Mr. Cromwell was leaning, cross-legged,
against the after-bridge bulkhead, gazing pen-
sively at the sun, which was sinking into the
sea in a blaze of angry glory. Captain Framm
strolled casually aft with a glowing cigar
between his teeth, and simulated a start
when his eyes fell upon the engineer. He
stopped.
“Fine night, Mr. Cromwell.”
“You ought to know, Mr. Framm. My
business is engines.”
"I take it we’re both pretty good in our
respective departments, Mr. Cromwell,” said
Captain Framm, casting a critical glance at
the sky immediately overhead.
“How do you make, that out?”
“Well, it’ll blow like the devil within six
hours; and the engines will keep turning in
spite of it.”
Mr. Cromwell uncrossed his legs, and his
face shone with gratified pride.
“They were cranky affairs when I took
over, Mr. Framm —and this Mclntyre feller
ought to be ashamed to call himself an
engineer. I wonder the things didn’t fly
to bits and punch holes all over your liuli,
but now”
“So I understood, Mr. Cromwell,” inter-
rupted Captain Framm. “And I’d like to
say that I was quite prepared to admit your
ability without all this demonstration of it.”
Mr. Cromwell stood erect, the better to
regard the other.
•‘Meaning what, Mr. Framm?” he asked
in a level voice.
“Well, we cleared for Valparaiso, Mr.
Cromwell. I thought you understood that.”
“They did mention it ashore, now I come
to think of it, Mr. Framm; but I was so
blithered at the time that I wouldn’t have
given a damn if they’d said Spitzbergen or
Mackenzie Bay. I presume you must have
engines under you to get even as far as
Valparaiso?”
Captain Framm removed the cigar from
his lips and stared at Mr. Cromwell incredu-
lously.
“D’you mean to say you were too drunk
to” he began, and checked himself.
Mr. Cromwell grinned.
“Never been too drunk in my life, Mr.
Framm. You can’t get that way. I admit
I was a bit”
He also checked himself as an idea
penetrated to his understanding. He
flushed slowly,’ his hands clenched, his eyes
half-closed, and he thrust a threatening
face to within six inches of the captain’s.
“Look here, Mr. Framm,” he said, between

liis teeth. “I’ve been out of a berth tor
nearly a year—l’ve told you that before —
but now I’ve got one I’m going to keep it
as long as it will float underneath me! Get
that?”
Captain Framm drew himself to his full,
considerable height.
“You will remember your place aboard
this ship, Mr. Cromwell —please!” ire
requested.
Mr. Cromwell held a huge, mace-like list
beneath the captain’s lifted nose.
“If you’re talking barratry to me, Mr.
Framm” Ire began, threateningly.
“Don’t be a damned fool, Mr. Cromwell!”
snapped Captain Framm. “And not so much
of the King Charles stuff!”
Mr. Cromwell’s eyes flashed ominously at
this allusion to his renowned namesake;
and Captain Framm, noting it, departed
quickly and in perturbation. Here was a
state of affairs upon which he had not
reckoned, and Captain Framm cursed the
agents in three languages in the privacy of
Ins- cabin. There wasn’t the slightest chance
of the engines falling to pieces while this
blasted Australian Bite had charge of ’em. It
wasn’t practicable to strip the propeller; and
if it was this confounded interloper would
ship another one without thinking about it.
There wasn’t a rock between here and Val-
paraiso ; and, despite her age, the Megina
was sound in every rivet. He besought all
the denizens of Gehenna to make a combined
raid on the body of Oliver Cromwell, and
deliver it over to the fiends. The Megina
was already out of the regular sea-lanes,
and nothing would have been easier than a
serious breakdown, which would involve her
abandonment eventually; but n0w.... ho
would have to try the other way.
Mr. Cromwell stood awhile, thinking, and
resolved to “sleep on Mr. Framm’s tail.”
Nine months ashore was enough.
Before morning it blew in accordance with
Captain Framm’s prophecy, and it continued
to blow for thirty-six hours. The battered,
rust-streaked Megina bounded over angry
waves with a light-hearted energy which
threw the watch below from their bunks
and disturbed the most hardened stomach;
the watch on deck clung like limpets to
anything within reach, the stokers bounced
off red-hot furnace doors, and Mr. Cromwell
whistled shrilly, and brought his favorite
spanner to bear in : support of his sobriquet;
the engines hammered and whistled with a
riotous abandon, which caused the propeller
to wave a derisive greeting to the elements
PERFECTION.
BELLA: “Is your new bathing costume a success?”
STELLA : “Oh, ripping! Nobody seems to notice that I’m wearing it.”
wliich threatened its destruction every time
the ship stood upon her nose.
At the end of the blow Captain Framm
detached himself from his bunk, and mounted
to the bridge. The morning was breaking
clear, and the ship hurdled over a field of
green, black and gold.
“A bad blow, Mr. Smart,” he said to the
oilskin-shrouded figure under the lee of the
weather-dodger. "Any damage?”
‘‘No, sir.”
“All the boats sound?”
“Yes, sir. Two men overboard, though.
Flescher from the port watch, and the
donkeyman.”
“Overboard? Why wasn’t I called?”
“Only just reported, sir. They must have
gone in the middle watch.”
“That’s bad, Mr. Smart. We can’t do
anything, of course?”
"Only go back and look for ’em, sir.”
“You have got religion, Mr. Smart,” said
Captain Framm, acidly.
Mr. Smart smiled sourly.
“I should be glad if you would overhaul
the boats to-day, Mr. Smart,” said Captain
Framm, when the sun had risen an inch
clear of the horizon. “Another blow like
that and we might need ’em,” he added,
seeing the first officer’s look of surprise.
“Aye, aye, sir.”
By nightfall the sea had subsided con-
siderably, and the wind had faded to an
occasional sigh. The engines clanked as
briskly as ever, but for the last hour or so
of daylight the speed of the ship had unac-
countably slackened. The hull lifted over
the heavy swell with increasing heaviness,
and settled deeper into the trough.
At one bell in the first watch Captain
Framm stepped on to the bridge, and a
worried frown sat upon his brow. He stared
forward at the faintly visible bow for a
while, then walked to the lee and observed
the stern.
“She’s getting a bit tricky on the helm,
sir,” the third officer said, after a pause
during which he assisted the inspection aft.
Captain Framm looked up. “Seems heavy
by the head, sir. Doesn’t answer her helm
as she should.”
Captain Framm inspected the bow again.
“Sound the for’ard wells, Mr. Brinkman,
he ordered. , .
Mr. Brinkman departed, and returned
within five minutes with slightly trembling
hands and a white face. “She’s making
water fast, sir!” he reported.
“For’ard?” queried Captain Framm incred-
ulously.
“Yes sir.**
Captain Framm stared for a moment, still
unwilling to believe ; then he came to life^.
“Well, what are you standing there tor,
Mr. Brinkman? Get all hands on the
pumps!”
There was no doubt about it. The Magma
was settling by the head, and the herculean
labors of a scared crew could not alter tne
fact. She continued to settle during the
whole of the first watch, and at eight beds
the pumps had slackened off, because the
crew, unused to such strenuous exercise,
were ap-
proaching exhaus-
tion. The respurces
of the engine-room
were insufficient to
check the inrush of
water, and it was
a gratified but ex-
tremely puzzled
master who at
length gave the
order to abandon
ship.
Captain Framm
stood with his
hands outspread
upon the bridge-
rail, silent, his face
set in grim lines,
nopeless tragedy in
his eyes and jubi-
lation in his heart.
Mr. Smart saw the
tragedy and re-
spected it because
be thought he un-
derstood it, and
with a silent, sym-
pathetic grip of
his master’s shoul-
der hurried away
to his duty of shep-
herding the crew
into the boats.
Captain Framm
checked the laugh
upon liis lips and
looked more tragic
than ever.
The fo’c’s’le-head
was a bare three
feet above water.
“Well?” snarled
the voice of the
Great Australian
Bite in his ear.
Captain Framm
turned with a tri-
umphant smile.
“Well, Mr. Crom-
well, your berth is sinking under you. What
nre you going to do about it.
“That’s what I’m asking you, Mr. Framm.
What are you going to do about it?”
“I,” replied Captain Framm, with an airy
wave of his hand, “I am going to step into
a boat and watch, with heavy heart, the
foundering of the dear old ship which is
the apple of my eye. After that, I shall
trust to the Laird of whom your predecessor,
Mr. Mclntyre, has spoken on occasion.
Won’t you join me?”
“I came up here to ask you to join me, Mr.
Framm.”
“Oh. but”
PROMOTED.
FAMOUS TRAGEDIAN: “You should have seen me in the part of the great Dane.”
THE DOG FANCIER: “Oh really! But I didn’t know you played in pantomime!”
“Won’t you change your mind, Mr.
Fra mm?”
Something hard was thrust against the
small of Captain Framm’s back, and the
flippant answer died on his lips.
“You’re going down with your ship, as
a British captain should, Mr. Framrn,” an-
nounced Mr. Cromwell in a low voice. “I
realise the folly of it, but tradition demands
it, all the same.”
Captain Framm made a movement as
though he would challenge the announce-
ment, and Mr. Cromwell stepped back a
pace without abating the pressure upon the
other’s back.
“Your only alternative is a bullet, Mr.
Framm,” continued Mr. . Cromwell in the
same tones. “When the ship dives you’ll
have a chance —the chance any man would
have under the circumstances —but if you
make a move to get off the bridge I’ll drop
you where you stand, and you’ll take your
chance in the next world; and I wouldn’t
give you tuppence for it!”
Captain Framm did not attempt to bluff.
He had dealt with too many men in his
career to be deceived in this one. His eyes
roved to right and left, but he knew that
the other could shoot him down before he
had moved a yard. The position looked
rather hopeless, but he was no coward. He
was a strong swimmer, and with ordinary
luck should be able to get clear before she
plunged. He would have to pass the word
to the boats to stand-by until she did. Bet-
ter if they stood-by until daylight.
Mr. Cromwell sensed what was passing
in his mind, and, as hurried footfalls sounded
on the bridge ladder, he stepped back to
the shelter of the wheelliouse with a mut-
tered warning.
“Send him away and keep your mouth
shut! I’m behind you !”
Mr. Smart leapt on to the bridge. “Last
boat ready to lower away, sir,” he announced
breathlessly; adding, as Captain Framm
made no move, “We won’t be able to get
her clear in a few minutes, sir!”
“I’ll stay here, Mr. Smart,” replied Cap-
tain Framm, after a moment’s hesitation.
“The ship hasn’t foundered yet, and, until
she does, it’s my duty—my duty, Mr.
Smart”. .. .
His voice trailed off pathetically, and Mr.
Cromwell marvelled at his histrionic ability.
“But—but you can't stay here, sir!” pro-
tested Mr. Smart. “She’ll dive any minute!
You’ve done all you could, sir!”
“I don’t think you quite understand, Mr.
Smart,” said Captain Framm. sorrow-
fully. “This ship, old as she is”
“She can’t last half an hour, sir. She’s
dipping her fo’c’s’le-head now!”
An impatient yell from aft spurred Mr.
Smart to further effort.
“They’ll lower away without us, sir,
if”
The Captain Fra mm whom he knew
emerged from the tragic figure with his
hands spread wide upon the rail.
“I gave the order to abandon ship, Mr.
Smart! See to it!”
Mr. Smart drew himself up, and saluted
as he might salute the bier of a national
leader, solemnly and respectfully.
“We’ll stand-by till daylight, sir,” he
said, and clattered away.
Mr. Cromwell came forward.
“Well, how was that, Mr. Cromwell?”
asked Captain Framm, turning to face the
other belligerently. “Another epic of the
sea, and all that, eh? Now you can put
that blasted gun away! I’m going to hunt
something that’ll lloat.”
He made as though to move off the bridge,
but Mr. Cromwell shot out a hand and
grasped his shoulder.
"You don’t have to hunt, Mr. Framm.
You’ve found it!”
“Keep your filthy hands off me!” flared
Captain Framm, turning sharply, and aiming
a wild blow at the figure which towered
above him.
Mr. Cromwell emitted a sharp “Oof!”
placed the heavy revolver carefully in the
hip pocket of his overalls, expectorated
deliberately into the palm of his right hand,
clenched it, and with a lightning blow
stretched Captain Framm upon the decking,
over which he slid until his progress was
checked by an iron stanchion ; then he lay
still.
Mr. Cromwell regarded the Megina as she
lay pitching regularly and sluggishly in the
blackness of the sea and sky. He gazed
for’ard, aft, aloft and whistled meditatively.
It was in his mind to pitch the inanimate
figure at his feet over the side in the direc-
tion of the shouts which came from the
straggling boats, but prudence suggested
otherwise. He stooped, picked up the sub-
dued Captain Framm, as he might have
picked up a sack of potatoes, and descended
to his cabin, where he lashed the captain’s
hands and feet with spun-yarn, and left
him lying upon the floor. After which Mr.
Cromwell went out and locked the door.

OUR XMAS GREETINGS TO ALL
“At every stage of life’s high road
Good. Luck and Pleasure meet you!”


He whistled shrilly and monotonously as
he moved about the engine-room, and pre-
sently the hum of the dynamo was supple-
mented by mord vigorous sounds.
* * * *
Mr. Smart piloted his boat by the sound
of the shouts, and joined the others; and
together they lay upon their oars and gazed
in the direction of the Megina, the lights
of which sprang into view as they were
lifted upon the crest of a wave and were
lost again as they descended into the trough.
So the crews watched for half an hour,
intently, silently. Then they lifted upon a
wave—and no lights were visible.
“Gone!” said Mr. Smart —and the others
knew that it was so.
But it was not so. Mr. Cromwell had
merely switched off all deck-lights, and only
the engine-rpom was illuminated.
Captain Framm opened his eyes to com-
plete darkness, and his ears to the sound of
labored breathing. His head ached, and ho
wondered where he was. When recollection
came to him he addressed the direction of
the breathing.
“Murder, is it?” he asked, bitterly.
There was no reply save a sound of strug-
gling, and he became aware that there were
two breathers. He had not time to become
aware of more details before the door opened
and a third person stepped confidently into
the darkness of the cabin, and shut the door
carefully. The third person struck a match
and lit the lantern which hung upon the
cabin wall, and Captain Framm looked upon
the long saturnine features of the Australian
Bite. lie looked in the direction of tiie
breathers, and perceived, to his unbounded
amazement, Flescher, of the port watch, and
the donkeyman tied back to back and thrown
upon the bunk, where they lay gagged and
helpless.
“Well, I’ll go hopping!” exclaimed Captain
Framm.
“You’ll go firing, that’s where you'll go,
my lad,” corrected Mr. Cromwell, stooping to
cut the bonds of his captives with an inad-
equate penknife.
Mr. Cromwell stood with his back to the
door and explained.
“Nine months I was out of a berth,” lie
began, in an aggrieved tone. “Nine solid,
miserable months! And when I shipped for
Valparaiso, I shipped for Valparaiso; and
to Valparaiso I’m going. There are four of
us here. That’s two tp a watch. Framm
will handle the shovel in the stokehold in
turns with Higgins”—here he glared at the
sulky donkeyman who was sitting on the
edge' of the bunk and rubbing his wrists —
“Flescher will take the wheel and lay the
course. He can do that —he’s got a first’s
ticket —and I’ll totter around the engines
and keep an eye on things generally. Is
that understood?”
He glared at each of his captives in turn.
Captain Framtn smiled sourly and caressed
his jaw gently, Higgins looked up under
his brows with a savage scowl, and Flescher
shrugged his shoulders indifferently.
“I may say,” he continued, “that Flescher
is in this with me. I tied him up with Hig-
gins just in case anybody should drop on to
him while we were waiting. That makes
us two against two, and I think you will
admit, Mr. Framm, that I have the better of
the argument.” He patted his hip pocket.
“So now we’ll get under way—if you don’t
mind.”
“Do I have to remind you that this is
mutiny, Mr. Cromwell?” asked Captain
Framm, acidly.
“You do not, Mr. Framm. And do I have
to remind you that it is a felony to open sea-
cocks with the intention of scuttling a ship
upon the high seas?”
Captain Framm snorted disdainfully.
“You’re mad, Mr. Cromwell!”
“So will ydu be before we hit Valparaiso.
Mr. Framm; make no error about that!
JUST A MINUTE OR TWO.
BETTY (looking at husband’s beard): “Why ever didn’t you shave, Billy?”
BILLY: “I did.”
BETTY: “When?”
BILLY: “As soon as you said you were nearly ready.”
We’ve got some four thousand miles to go,
and I reckon we’ll be able to raise enough
steam to do about four knots. Figure it
out yourself. You’ll be working for the
first time in jour life. Mr. Framm. And
as for you, Higgins,” he added venomously,
turning to the donkeymau, “you’ve got to
be taught to keep your mouth shut. You’ll
cross tbe Great Australian Bite at your
own risk!” ,
He reached down the lantern from the
bulkhead and waved Captain Framm and
Higgins to the door with the heavy spanner
which had suddenly materialised in his hand,
shot a few -brisk instructions at Flescher,
who disappeared in the direction of the
bridge, and herded the others to the stoke-
hold.
“Sorry the plates are awash, Air. Framm,
he said politely, when they had reached the
depths, "but you were such a darned long
time making up your mind to abandon ship
that I was thinking I’d have to draw the
Captain Framm scowled heavily, folded
his arms and leaned back against the ladder.
He was waiting for the ship to dive and
calculating his chances of survival.
“You can’t bully me, Mr. Cromwell,” he
boasted, with a show of spirit.
Mr. Cromwell’s span-
ner dematerialised,
and he spat upon his
hands and rubbed
them together in anti-
cipation.
“Now, let us get this
quite right, gentle-
men, before we go any
further,” he begged.
“We’ve got no boats,
we’re out of the regu-
1a r sea-lanes, and
something's got to be
done about it. I’ve
given you my views
on the matter, and
now I’d like to hear
yours. Come on!
Separately, or to-
gether !”
They came together;
Higgins with an up-
raise d shovel, and
Captain Framm witii
bare fists and fury.
Mr. Cromwell deport
ed himself according
to the traditions of his
great country. Tie hit.
everything in sight,
hard and often, and at
the end of a cheerful
three minutes stood
wiping the blood from
his lips with the back
of his hand, and smil-
ingly regarding the
battered remains of
his antagonists.
“Having arrived at
an amicable settle-
ment,” he said, when
he had recovered his
breath, Captain Framm had opened one eye,
and Higgins had given a long-drawn groan
to indicate that he still lived, "we will pro-
ceed as arranged; and just to let you see
there’s no ill feeling, I’ll show you how I
want it done.”
He procured a shovel, expertly opened a
furnace door, and commenced to shovel coal
beneath, the boiler with an easy rhythm. He
continued to fire and slice until the others
were able to stand on their feet without
assistance, and by that time the steam-gauges
were beginning to exhibit a little animation
also,
“Well?” he asked, cheerfully, wiping his
streaming face with his sweat-rag.
Captain Framm tottered to a shovel, and
picked it up with a rueful smile,
“Righto,” said Mr. Cromwell, heartily,
“You can take the first spell. Higgins, you
ca n bunk-down in the engine-room, where I
can keep an eye on you.”
Higgins staggered gratefully away,
“You will uotice, Mr. Framm,” Mr. Crom-
well went on, when the donkeyman had dis-
appeared, “that the plates are no longer
awash.”
Captain Framm stared at the floor with
bewildered eyes, and his mouth opened and
shut like that of a stranded fish. It was
incredible, but true! The water was subsid-
ing and the Megina was lifting. She wasn’t
going to dive!
“You see, Mr. Framm, I was sleeping on
your tail, and when you opened the sea-
cocks I naturally closed ’em again. The
water for’ard was pumped in, as it’s now
being pumped out. I had to get rid of the
rest of the bunch because I couldn’t be sure
whether there were any more like you who
were being paid to send her to the’ bottom!”
Captain Framm was silent, not because he
liad nothing to say, but because he didn’t
know how to put his views convincingly
before this —this —this He stuck at that
point also.
=l= * * *
“Gone all right,” said Mr. Smart, looking
over an empty sea as the day broke.
Some two months later Mr. Mclntyre sat
in the private office of the managing director
of the Malloring line. He was looking virtu-
ously at the ceiling, and carefully folding
some scraps of paper preparatory to return-
ing them to his wallet, which lay open upon
his knee.
“Ah owe it ta.e ma conscience tae pub-
leesh thees irre-/cietable evidence, Mr. Mal-
loring!” he was saying. “Ah canna sleep
easy o’ nichts whin Ah theenk o’ yon puir
bodies ganging tae the Judgment wi’ thees
awfu’ seen upon theer immortal souls! It

THE DAUGHTER: “Oh, I think he’s much in love with me. He told me he could live
on my kisses for ever.”
DADDY: “Uh—and are you going to let ki m?"
THE DAUGHTER: “Well, Daddy, I thought I’d better find out first what I'M going to
live on.”
puir loon Cromwell perished instead o
masel’; and the fact that Framm died in
carrying oot hees feelonious pairpose disna
exonerate them that sent the Megina tae
the bottom!”
Mr. Malloring was conciliatory but firm.
“I can only repeat, Mr. McIntyre, that
your charge will not hold water. If those
are actually the calculations made by the
late Captain Framm for the purpose which
you allege—and I do not doubt your word,
Mr. McIntyre,” he insisted hurriedly, as the
engineer elevated his chin and peered indig-
nantly through his steel-rimmed spectacles—
“they were made without the knowledge of
this office. If you do publish them, they
may or may not affect the question of the
insurance of the Megina; but we would wel-
come the fullest investigation, you may rest
assured of that. For my part, I think you
might waive the claims of conscience on this
occasion, and let Captain Framm’s memory
rest upon the heroism which he displayed in
refusing to leave the bridge. It would be a
charitable tribute to a brave man—who died
repentant.”
Mr. Malloring’s voice dropped reverently,
and he was silent.
“Ooh aye,” agreed Mr. Mclnytre, dubi-
ously, “but whit aboot thees other puir body,
Cromwell?”
Mr. Malloring smiled sorowfully.
“As he, in a manner of speaking, usurped
your position aboard the Megina, Mr. McIn-
tyre, it hast occurred to me that, taking into
consideration also your long service with the
company, we might appoint you to the posi-
tion of chief on, our new passenger boat, the
Moesia, which is now off the stocks. And
I may add that we appreciate your action
in leaving the Megina as soon as you sus-
pected”—
“An’ whit would the salary be, noo?”
interrupted Mr. McIntyre tentatively. “Sup-
posin’ Ah wis favorably eenclined tae the
proposeetion,” he added hurriedly.
“Well, now, Mr. McIntyre,” replied Mr.
Malloring, leaning back in his chair, and
placing his finger-tips together, “suppose we
say, for a start”
The door was thrust open unceremoni-
ously, and an excited manager pushed a
paper into Mr. Malloring’s hand.
“Just received from our New York agent,
sir,” he explained, almost hysterically, and
shuffled his feet nervously.
Mr. Malloring adjusted his horn-rimmed
spectacles, and read the paper with a glance;
then he frowned, and swore under his breath.
He tossed the cablegram to McIntyre, and
smiled sneeringly.
“For you, Mr. McIntyre,” he said, shortly.
Mr. McIntyre perused the brief message
three times before its significance was fully
borne in upon him: —
Valparaiso reports arrival Megina Captain William
Framm eiglity-one days out from Sydney.—Mallor.
Mr. McIntyre sighed wearily.
“Ah wis juist conseedering, Mr. Mallor-
ing,” he said at last, “the matter o’ salary
disna’ consairn me tae ony great extent,
all “There isn’t any matter of salary, Mr.
McIntyre,” snapped Mr. Malloring, “nor any
question of a further appointment with us.
The Malloring line has no use for engineers
who desert their ships, Mr. McIntyre. That
will be all. Mr. Fraser, kindly show Mr.
McIntyre the door!” .
Mr. McIntyre strolled disconsolately in
the Old Kent-road.
“The Laird must hae spoken to Billy
Framm,” he decided aloud, and, could he have
heard him the Great Australian Bite would
have been flattered.
W. GRAEME-HODDER.
“Little Jesus.”
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
McGRATH sat on the half-rotted foot-
log in front of the fire, toying with
the kid’s shoes. He had noticed them
sticking out from beneath the oilskin that
he had tucked round the little fellow, and
had limped across to the edge of the fire-
circle and undone the laces and taken tfie
clumsy, thick-soled things off. They had
looked uncomfortable, and he thought the kid
would sleep better without them.
The kid hadn't stirred. McGrath, when
he found the great blackbutt lying across, the
road, with its crushed branches dipping into
the precipice on the right, had taken the cob
out of the sulky, tethered him to a root
and got the kid to curl up on the leather
seat which he had taken from the sulky.
Gods, how that kid had chattered! All up
the mountain road, with the cob walking and
straining every inch of the way, that little
tongue had never stopped. “Daddie dear
H'e had a lovely way of using endearing
expressions in questions. There was nothing
sentimental about it. Nor was it cunning.
The kid was only four. The “dears” just
tripped off his tongue. His grannie must
have liked them and encouraged him to use
plenty of them. So he chattered them out,
though he and McGrath were strangers to
each other. The red parrots flashing across
the road, an occasional paddymelon thumping
away through the brush, a flock of black
swans flying high overhead like aeroplanes
—there was some question with a “dear” in
it about them all.
McGrath was human, though his long,
thinly-thatched head and his uncollared
throat and calloused hands were all busli-
browned and shrivelled ; and he smiled now
across the fire at the black oilskin bundle,
with the silky hair gleaming silver in the
firelight. He did not think very quickly
or clearly; the years of trying to cleave a
holding out of the jungle on the rugged
plateau had dulled his brain a lot; but in
his slow way he thought now that it was
queer how the kid had got a hold of him in
the half-day and couple of hours of night
that they had been together.
The kid had accepted him at once. He
had put up his little hand when McGrath’s
sister handed him out of the train at the
siding, and the first “Daddie dear” had
come within minutes. A strange little cuss,
McGrath thought: damn good looking, as
his mother had been. But in the sulky,
climbing tortuously up that long mountain
road, McGrath had glanced down now and
again, and his eyes had always lingered on
the kid’s ears. He could not help it; he
tried hard not to do it; but always those
odd little ears held him in spite of himself,
in spite of the fight against the baseless
suspicion that was going on within him.
The ears were not misshapen. Simply,
instead of turning in and up at the bottom
to form the lobe, they kept on straight down,
tapering and losing themselves in the smooth
whiteness of the neck. They were an old
sword in McGrath’s side, those ears. Peter-
sen, who had camped on the holding nearly
five years before and helped him get the
cedar out and down the mountain to the
river, had had ears like that. That was all.
McGrath knew he had never had any cause
for suspicion. He had been deeply in love
with Mollie; had treated her as decently as
he could on their selection. He felt, always
had felt, that she was very fond of him, too.
And yet it was now all turning over and
over again in his mind. Mollie had liked
Petersen. But there was nothing strange
about that. Out there, with only himself
for company, she welcomed —could not help
Avelcoming—almost any sort of human. And
Petersen was likeable. He himself liked
him. He liked him still, though he had not
seen him for years.
He had flushed with shame when the
horrible thought first came to him and he
flushed now. But the thought stayed. Nothing
would get it out. In the four years since
Mollie had died, with the tiny little bundle
in her arms —in all the four years during
which his mother had cared for the child-
tile thought had come to him again and

again. It would crop up for no reason at
all, when he would be felling a scrub-tree
fifteen feet up on the springboard. Or at
night when he was trying to get to sleep in
the two-roomed house that he and Mollie
had shared for only a year together. It
came at any time.... There was that day
Petersen and Mollie were down paving the
spring-hole with flat stones. . . .
No, it had never been at all! He mut-
tered it now at the fire that separated him
from the little bundle in the oilskin. It
had never been!
And yet there were those ears. He could
see the outline of one of them now. It held
him, fascinated him. Il’e stood up, still
dangling the stumpy shoes, and, with the
slight limp that came from the twist in
ankle and heel of his right foot, stepped
round the few burning logs and bent over
the snowy head.
He straightened himself abruptly, savagely,
as if he had been caught doing something
secret and guilty, and went back to his place
on the half-rotted log.
He wanted then, more than he had ever
wanted before, to destroy that hateful thing
in himself, to believe that there never had
been anything. There were those photos in
his mother’s album that he had chanced on
as he mooned about after he first discovered
the ears. They were only snaps, but in one
of her father he could almost be sure that
there was the same curiousness he had
noticed in Petersen’s cars—no lobe; just
tapering straight down. Almost—he could
not be quite sure. He had wanted to ask
his mother if her father had had ears like
that, but he had been too ashamed to do it.
It sounded so—so rotten.
And now his mother had died, and his
sister had wasted no time in getting rid of
the infant, as she had long itched to do, so
he had gone down to the siding and taken the
boy.
The little bundle he was watching moved,
and he jumped up at once and limped round
to it. He put the shoes down while he
tucked the oilskin in tight under the leather
seat. He let his hard big hand feel over
the silky head. As he bent down low he
could smell the warm, living little life. He
thought it smelt like a huddle of sleeping-
pups. H’e remembered burrowing his nose in
among such a huddle years and years before,
when he was a youngster. It was a smell
something like toast being made at an open
fire.
He let his dry lips just touch the snowy
hair, and the fresh, clean smell came to him
a little stronger.
Pups.... toast the kid.
A half-smile curled out from his mouth
as he straightened up. Still looking down
he noticed that the kid had dark, black
eyelashes, as Mollie had. They seemed
to rest on the white of his face like
moths.
And then his eyes were looking at the
ears again. The smile had gone. His thin
brown face was set hard. The thing was
gnawing at the inside of him. A half-
suspicion, a doubt, a nothing, an emptiness.
And he could not get rid of it.
He bent down stiffly and took up the shoes
again and went back to his log. The fire
was getting low, but he did not bother to
rebuild it. He had lighted it only to amuse
the kid, and had delighted him immensely
with it.
The little bundle had lain there looking
across it at him, chattering away about the
curlews crying somewhere down over the
precipitous siue, and the sugar ’possums
squeaking now and then in the brush above
the cutting. .Chattering, the little chap
had fallen asleep at last, after saying
a funny little prayer, and soon after-
wards drowsily adding that he was “warm
as little Jesus.”
McGrath thought that was a strange thing
for a kid to say. Jesus to himself had never
seemed small like that. He had never thought
of Him tucked up in the manger. Con-
sciously, he had scarcely ever in his whole life
thought of Jesus at all; but the Jesus that-
lived in liis sub-conscious, a hang-over from
childhood, was big, a sort of nebulous giant,
too big for him to even think about. To be
warm as “little Jesus” was a new one on
him.
The kid’s quaint phrase kept cropping up
in his thought, as lie sat watching the fire die
away and beyond it the bundle in the oilskin.
Nothing could have been gained by turning
back when he had found the blackbutt across
the road. He had some bread in the sulky
and tinned food, and the night was clear.
He had decided to wait till morning, and
the kid had taken to the idea as a sort of
game. And now he was tucked up there,
asleep.
The faint smile that had come to McGrath
when he had thought of the kid as smelling
like a huddle of clean pups came to him
again from the phrase reiterating in his
thought. It was broader, cutting across the
hard lines that sloped down beside his mouth
and filling his face with friendliness. It was
a warm smile; a smile of happiness sprung
from a good thought. The kid had got hold
of him. And whether that other had hap-
pened or whether it hadn’t, the little fellow
was Mollie’s. Also, he was a lovable little
chap. McGrath’s good thought was that he
was glad he had him.
Then, suddenly, the smile vanished. Mc-
Grath’s eyes stared open. His hands gripped
on the shoes he had been endlessly toying
with. H'e waited, staring straight ahead,
seeing nothing.
Perhaps a minute. Then, hesitatingly, he
lifted the shoes and looked at them like a
watchmaker looking into a kinked hair-
spring.
There was a kink ! It was so slight that
no one would ever have noticed it, just a
twist in the right one, bending round from
the ankle to the heel.
McGrath glancetl down at his own slightly-
twisted ankle. Then he just sat and looked
at the kid’s shoe.
He sat looking still when he could see no
longer; when he could just make out the
little bundle huddled in the blue dark-
ness—and the two of them were alone.
and the fire had gone out he and
his son.
CECIL MANN.
A Girl and a Mob of
Cattle.
[F OR THE BULLETIN.]
IT’LL, be Christmas Week. The annual
change in the solemn, plodding home-
steaders will have set in strong. They’ll
be making special trips to the township to
buy a “few little extra things”; and
some will take their wives and families with
them, though most times it will be the wives
that will take the husbands.
You yourself, though still a bachelor doing
your own bit of washing and cooking and
sweeping out, will trot along like the rest
for a pound or two of raisins to try your
hand on a pudding, and perhaps you’ll plunge
on a hat and a couple of flannels as well.
And what a bureau of information the
store will be to the lot of you !
“D’you know who’s come home for Christ-
mas?” you’ll hear from the bustling store-
keeper as you step on the verandah and
reach the door. But before he can get any
further his wife, who’s at the other end of
the counter helping in the rush, will broad-
cast: “Willie Hodgson and the two McJNa-
maras.”
“And is it true,” the oldest customer will
ask as he squeezes one of his feet into a
new blucher, “that Sam Telford is back
after being in th’ Never Never for fifteen or
seventeen years?”
“That’s so,” the storekeeper, scooping cur-
rants out of a bin for Mrs. Flinn, will pro-
claim. “He came back a day or two ago.
Then there’ll be a pause to place the cur-
rants on the scales. And in the pause Mrs.
Storekeeper will take up Sam Telford and
give full details of his arrival, adding that
“lie’s going to stay at Rudd's place, so they
told us.”
Mention of Sam Telford will almost take
your breath away. “What’s that?” you'll
ask, pushing your way in among the women
and kids. “You mean Sam Telford whose
father was killed by th’ blacks?”
“Th’ same,” proudly from the storekeeper
as he squints closely at the .scales for the
third or fourth time.
“And a smart-looking man he’s turned out,
too,” will come from Airs. Storekeeper for
the benefit of the lady customers, “with his
beard and strapped trousers, though he must
be middle-aged now.”
“Sam Telford back, eh?” you’ll smile, let-
ting the raisins and the hat and flannels sup
out of your head. “Me an’ him were pals
for years out on the Warrego and the
Cooper. Gad, I must see old Sam before
lie’s off again, wherever lie is.”
“You’ll see him, Dick,” the storekeeper,
taking back a few more of Mrs. Flinn’s cur-
rants to make the load lighter for her to
carry, will assure you—“he’s sure to be in
here again with some of the Rudds. We’ll
tell him about you, and where your place is.”
“And tell him I’ve got whips of room for
him,” you’ll say; and out you’ll stride as if
you’ve finished your shopping. But before
reaching your horse you’ll stop abruptly and
return with a foolish-looking grin on your
face.
* * * *
It’ll be Christmas Eve now. Having had
your dinner you’ll be standing in the door-
way filling your pipe. The rubbish lying
about will catch your eye and start you won-
dering if it wouldn’t be as well to clean it
up and make the place look a bit tidy in case
you might have a visitor or two. The
thought has scarcely entered your head when
you’ll realise that three horsemen have en-
tered the gate and are almost at your door.
How on earth you didn’t see them sooner has
got you beat! And while you’re_ feeling
puzzled, two of them, one a boy, will greet
you mirthfully, the first addressing you as
Dick, the other as R-R-Richard. The third
will regard you with twinkling eyes and a
broad smile. In an instant, of course, you’ll
recognise Dave and Joe Rudd, though you
will have seen a little of them for over a
year.
“Don’t you know who this bloke is, Dick?”
Dave will ask pointing proudly to Sam Tel-
ford as they all dismount.
“We’ve b-b-brought him over to s-s-see y\
and to have after-n-n-noon tea, Dick,” Joe’ll
stutter with even more pride than Dave, for
they’ll both be in charge of the lion.
“Sam!” you’ll exclaim, and, bounding from
the verandah, you’ll grab his hand and he’ll
grab yours. Then looking you up and
down he’ll reckon you haven’t altered a
darn bit.
“Neither have you, Sam —hanged if you
have!” and your eyes, and his, too, will
sparkle with the light of old friendship
brought to mind.
Leading the way, you’ll invite him into
“the castle” (Dave and Joe will require no
invitation). “And tell us what you’ve been
doing since that Christmas —how many years
ago?—when we parted out on Maguire’s old
cattle station.”
“About seventeen,” Sam will remember.
“I s-s-say, Dick,” Joe will break in, “them
hens o’ yours has been eatin’ pumpkin
s-s-seed.”
“Why?” you’ll ask indifferently, looking
at the fowls that are dodging about. “What
makes you think that, Joe?”
“Be th’ w-w-way they 1-1-lean back when
they walk an’ shove their hind-p-p-part along
like p-p-penguins.”
“Like your gran’mother!” Dave will guf-
faw at his young brother.
“They won’t 1-1-lay any m-m-more eggs for
y’, Dick,” Joe, ignoring Dave, will persist
as they step on to the verandah, “unless y’
give them p-plenty o’ s-s-salts.”
“Was that what they used to give ’em
to you for?” Dave will guffaw again; and
Sam and you will break into mirth as you
enter the castle.
“You’re surprised, I suppose, Sam,” you’ll
begin, dragging the chairs together, “to find
I’ve turned out a cockic? But tell us some-
thing about the West. I suppose if a fellow
like me was taken out there now blindfold
and let go. In' wouldn’t know where he was.
And how did Maguire get on —make his
pile?”
“Oh, the old man passed out long ago,
Dick.” Sam, who’s a good talker and no ordi-
nary bushman, will answer as he rests the
left" boot on his right knee and toys with the
rowel of his spur. “Pay, the daughter—you
remember her —came in for everything when
he died, and took over the station herself,
and managed it splendidly, too.”
You'll look surprised that a bit of a girl
as she’ll appear in your mind could run a
large cattle station —a job that lots of men
wouldn’t tackle.
“A girl managin’ a station?”- Dave will
grin doubtingly. “Cripes, there must be a
lot of the man in her !”
“No,” Sam will answer quietly; “a fine-
looking girl she is, very tall, a great horse-
woman, very game, very determined, and
quite at home, day or night, in any part of
the Bush. Very few men better than her /
“And how big is tli’ s-.s-station, S-S-Sam?”
Joe will want to know; “and how many kuk-
kuk-cattle has she got on it?”
“Well, I suppose you could ride in a
straight line for a hundred miles or so with-
out crossing the boundary of it,” he’ll be
told.
“W-w-what?” from Joe. “A ’undrcd
m-in-mile?”
“Ghost!” Dave will add.
“And about 20,000 head of cattle when
I was there. But for a while she lost some
big mobs. A couple of ‘gentlemen’ buyers
used to call and take a hundred or -so off her
hands at her own price and hand them over
to their men, staying over-night themselves
playing and singing songs, while a second
lot of men moved off with a thousand head
or so, keeping in the tracks of the others, but
travelling by night.”
“Holy!” Dave will gasp, leaning across
the table, while Joe will echo: “A th-tli-
thousand!”
“The time came, though”—Sam wi.l
pause to put down his foot and stretch out
lii.s two long bow-legs in comfort —“when
she got even with them.”
“W-what did she d-d-do, Sam?” from Joe.
“Day a trap for them?” from Dave.
“Well, this is one instance. I was up
to my eyes in it with her, as it happened. ’
“Cripes! He never told us this one be-
fore,” Dave will gush in anticipation.
Then Sam will lean forward, press his
palms down hard on his thighs, and with
eyes opening wide, and glistening like the
leaves of the myall in a sun-shower, will
proceed:
“We were mustering on the western side
along Boomerang Creek —you’ll remember it,
Dick ?”
You’ll nod, of course, whether you remem-
ber it or not.
“There was Fitzmaurice, the head stock-
man ; Gongoola, a half-caste reared on the
station; Fay Maguire, and yours truly. Fay
was riding her grey mare Britomarte, a
splendid beast among stock; in fact, we
were all mounted on the station’s best.”
“I reckon you would be, Sam,” you'll
break in reminiscently, your eyes starting
to light up as iu fancy you see and scent
the mobs and the mulga; “but the old place
never had a bad horse on it.”
“As a rule we could muster a couple of
thousand head of cattle at that end of the
run, but this time we hadn’t been a couple
of hours on the Creek when Gongoola, with
a shake of his head, decided ‘No cattle been
runnin’ here for long time!’ I agreed with
him, but Fitzmaurice kept a still tongue. So
we worked Boomerang Creek the whole of
that day, only coming across about a hun-
dred head, and made the old hut out there
our headquarters.”
“And did the girl,” Dave will put in with
a curious grin, “camp with all you blokes?”
“Safety in numbers, Dave,” Sam will
answer. “Besides, Gongoola took care of
her. Well, next day we came across some
tracks ’way up the river. At first only
an odd one or two, stragglers. But further
along we got on the tracks of a mob. They
came out of a belt of mulga, swam the river,
crossed the boundary and headed due west.
As it happened, we were all together, having
made the spot where we picked up the first
tracks our meeting-place. The time would
be about noon. As each of us rode studying
those tracks in silence, our thoughts all ran
in the one direction. For there it was writ-
ten on the ground, as plain as if it was
printed on paper, that a mixed mob of at
least a thousand head had been driven off
the run —and driven by five horsemen, two of
them on shod horses!”
“Holy! Eh!” And Dave will gape open-
mouthed.
“ ‘Gone about three day,’ Gongoola said
as we all came together again. For a few
moments we just sat in our saddles looking
at one another.
“ ‘What do you want us to do, Miss
Maguire?’ Fitzmaurice asked at last, speak-
ing slowly while he dragged hairs from his
horse’s mane.
“ ‘To follow them up as fast as we can,
of course,’ she answered sharply. And when
we caught the look that flashed from her
eyes we knew that she meant it, too, woman
or no woman.
“‘Not much use rushing after them now
when they’ve got three days’ start,’ he
demurred. ‘There’s no cattle country to
the west of here that I know of, and you’ll
find those tracks will swing right south
before going far and get lost in the lagoon
country.’
“ ‘That will be for us to find out,’ she
answered. ‘Now, hurry, men, get the spare
horses and packs, and we’ll follow them.’”
“And sh-sh-she was a woo-woo-woma/i, was
she?” Joe will stutter in astonishment.
To which Dave will answer: “You don’t
think she was a man, do y’?”
“N-N-No,” from Joe again—“an’ I d-d-don’t
think you are either, D-D-Dave.”
“In less than a couple of hours we were
on those tracks again, trailing them at a
fair pace with our faces to the West, Gon-
goola leading the way. I can see him now
as plain as I could see him then—leaning
over his horse’s shoulder, his eyes scanning
the ground, while his silence made him seem
uncanny. Towards nightfall those tracks
increased, showing another mob had joined
in the grass and herbage became scarce and
scarcer and the water we came to was only
soakage.
“Gongoola at intervals would turn Ms head
to tell us it was right, but Fitzmaurice all
the time was troubled with doubts.”
“W-W-What was that y’ s-s-said, Sam*.'”
Joe, not understanding, will inquire.
Sam will explain and go on: “Before it
got dark we came upon a fair-sized water-
hole untouched by cattle or stock of
any kind, and camped beside it for the
night.”
“Gripes, and wasn’t she frightened?” Dave
will wonder.
“Not the least; anyway, she didn’t show
it. Y’see the Bush had been mother to Fay
Maguire. Besides, Gongoola kept an eye on
her sleeping-place, lifting his head at inter-
vals to see she was not disturbed. I can see
that camp now. A solitary owl, I remember,
looked down upon the lot of us from the
branch of a withered tree blinking in the dim
light of the stars.”
“I seen them 1-1-like that round our culti-
v-v-vation,” Joe will tell us.
“Oh, shut up!” and Dave in reproval will
press his foot on Joe’s. Joe will rescue it
and kick out at Dave.
“Next morning we got going early and
followed on till about three or four o’clock
in the afternoon, when Fitzmaurice seemed
to lose hope completely. Though he said little
he looked back at every turn. He seemed to
be making calculations of the distance we
had come —of the number of miles it was
to the fringe of mulga that now lay behind
far over the plain. To the rest of us who
gazed ahead in search of new objects, the
gleaming, stretches seemed to be dipping
over a horizon that led to God knows
where.”
“ Gripes!” Dave, leaning back from the
table, will whisper to you—“ Sam can tell
it all right!” But you’ll nudge him to keep
silent.
“As we trailed along the horses suddenly
made a bound and snorted. To our surprise
a calf staggered to its feet from the shade of
a salt-bush. It had knocked up, and
beeu abandoned by the raiders. The
poor little brute was famishing, and hadn’t
long to live, and at sight of it we figured
that the driven mob was not far off. As it
staggered from horse to horse mistaking them
in turn for its mother, Fitzmaurice took
out his revolver and looked meaningly at
Fay Maguire.
“ ‘lt’s the kindest thing to do, I suppose,’
she said.”
“And d-d-did he shoot it, S-S-Sam?” Joe
will ask.
“Of course he did, y’ goat!” Dave will
snigger disrespectfully.
“Another hour and a hot wind blew up—
the hottest I was ever in. You’d think it
was coming out of a furnace. It seemed to
finally decide Fitzmaurice and suddenly he
reined in. ‘lt’s madness, Miss Maguire,’ he
said, ‘to go any further. We've scarcely
any rations left; and if there’s no grass and
water on ahead, what’s going to happen the
lot of us?’
“She put it to Gongoola.
“ ‘Cattle-stealers know plenty good country
out here,’ he grinned, ‘or they wouldn’t take
big mob.’ Gongoola was always logical.
“ ‘But this mob might only be wandering
off to Hell!’ Fitzmaurice argued. ‘Cattle
take those fits sometimes.’
“ ‘Are you becoming afraid?’ she asked,
her brown eyes flashing. ‘lf you are, I
expect you can find your way home!’
“ ‘l’m not afraid,’ he protested, ‘but I’m
not going to be a darn fool any longer either
for all the cattle on earth.’ AVitli that he
turned his horse and left us.”
“Cripes! Went back on his own, eh!"
from Dave.
“Yes, and Gongoola and I went on with her
to see it out.”
“She was pup-pup-plucky all right!” Joe
decided.
“ ‘lt’s hard to believe a man could be such
a cur,’ was all she said as we continued to
run those tracks into the setting sun.
“The wide plain now appeared to he
coming to an end. Two pinnacles came in
sight; and we could see that the country
sloped away on either side of them into
lightly-timbered valleys. Gongoola, pointing
his whip-handle, grinned. Fay Maguire
could only stammer a word or two in her
excitement.
“Passing between these pinnacles, standing
there like a natural gateway, we got the
surprise of our lives. Before us as far as we
could see were rich grass lands, with clumps
of forest trees. ‘What country is this, Gon-
goola?’ Fay Maguire asked in wonder. But
the half-caste was as much astonished as
she. A little further on we reined in to
gaze in amazement upon a lake, and all along
it, and out from it, cattle, cattle, sleek fat
contented cattle! We hadn’t gone above a
mile further before Gongoola cried out,
pointing to a dozen head or so grazing quite
near : ‘Here —look ! Them been Homestead
bullocks —got ’m our brand, T.M.—look
it!”
“ ‘So this is where they all are!’ Fay
Maguire muttered. ‘The plant of cattle-
thieves !’
“And all I could say was that I was
damned.
“We’d hardly recovered from the surprise
when a well-mounted chap came riding leis-
urely across us. ‘Hello, you Billy Fitz-
maurice!’ Gongoola called to him. Then 1
gasped ‘Almighty!’ For he was our head
stockman’s brother!”
“Cripes!” Dave will break out. “so that
was why the cow went back! He knew.
Then there will be an interruption. The
doorway of your home will be darkened by a
burly, bewhiskered figure standing in it gaz-
ing on the group of you. and brandishing
a green switch that he used as a riaing-
whip.
“D-d-dad/” Joe, looking up, will stutter,
and turn attentively to Sam again. But Sam
will be looking up, too.
“Cripes!” Dave will whine in protest to
Dad —“you spoilt it, cornin’ in!”
“So this is where you all are?” Dad will
roar. “With your heads together like sheep
in a storm hidin’ from the thunder an’ light'
nin’, an’ a hundred of .someone’s pigs out
there in your cultivation, Dick, spoilin’ your
corn an’ pumpkins!”
“Pigs!” and you’ll foul Sam and the table
in your haste to get out to the rescue.
And Sam and the others will follow to
give you a hand.

In all the works of Australian men with breadth of vision, the urge of building and preparation is visible.
It is visible in banking. The great banks, like the great pastoralists and’ manufacturers, are pioneers.
They are going out where they are wanted to-day and will be urgently wanted to-morrow. They are
establishing departments, services, facilities which are needed to-day and will be deeply needed to-morrow.
The growth of the National Bank’s 336 branches and 157 sub-offices, and the extension of its departments
until it can serve its clients in a thousand intimate ways, has been planned on foreknowledge of the work
that can be done by a corps of financial specialists inspired by a code of public service.
The National Bank of Australasia, as it stands to-day,
is not a mere counting-house. It is a brain with nerve
centres in every vital part of every country. In spite of
its vastness it is so human that it gladly advises even
the least of its clients on any matter of financial concern.
Knowing how vital it is for women who have never
handled business affairs to receive competent advice on
money questions, it has established a women s depart-
ment with a special staff of officers.
All this may be in a sense ahead of the times. Australia
could, if it had to, rub along without it. But Australia
can develop more surely, safely and rapidly by virtue
of financial vigilance. Its industries can benefit by the
knowledge of world conditions wbich flows into The
National” by cable, radio and mail from every centre of
population. Its residents can gain by the multitudinous
facilities wHicH The National proffers
them in connection with their financial
affairs.
Every Australian should know what
help “The National” and other banks can
give him. Every Australian should learn
to use to the full all the specialised
service available for his
assistance.

Santa Claus took on
his job, involving, as you
know, a remarkable amount of
getting about, he decided to
travel by air. For a thousand
years or so he was the only
Christmas aviator.
Things began to change a few
years ago, and already, at
Christmas, many men and
women fly home for annual
reunions and make quick aero-
plane visits to widely scattered
friends, covering long distances
with very great ease.
Do the same yourself by owning
a Moth. Flying aDe Havilland
Moth is as safe, economical
and practicable as owning and
driving a car. The only hous-
ing room required is a garage
of ordinary size. Moth owners
have the advantage of a Service
Organisation which covers the
whole Commonwealth.
Our new booklet dealing with private
flying in Australia would interest you
deeply. If you will send your name and
address we will forward a copy free.

leaden Stiff/
THIRTY-FOUR years ago the Vacuum Oil Company
Pty., Ltd., pioneered the oil business in Australia* It
was the first oil company to erect its own warehouses
and manufacturing plants in Australia, and bring direct ship-
ments of petroleum products to this country.
In the early days the Company marched, step by step, with
the pioneers, often going ahead of them; making its products
available in many places long before it was profitable so to do.
TO-DAY the well-known products of the Company are
available in every part of Australia, New Zealand and the
South Pacific Islands. During the last five years the
Company has expended over £4,000,000 in bringing its manu-
facturing and distributing organisation to the highest pitch
of efficiency. Since 1895 the original staff of three has
grown to over 3000 British employees, many of whom are
shareholders in the Company, with an annual pay-roll of
more than £1,000,000.
By reason of its large, manufacturing activities, through the
sustained quality of its products, and by the thorough-
going service supporting its products, the Company has
achieved a notable place in the forefront of Australian indus-
trial and commercial life.
