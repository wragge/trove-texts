AFRAID OF FOOD.
Sufferers from indigestion very often become faddists as regards their food, and find
themselves in time reduced to a very meagre and unsatisfying diet. Hudson’s Eumen-
thol Jujubes correct acidity of the stomach, and their antiseptic properties prevent
abnormal fermentation of the food, thus allowing the natural digestive ferments to act,
and if taken regularly after meals they so
improve the digestion that a strict diet be-
comes unnecessary. Hudson’s Eumenthol
Jujubes are most useful to those who suffer
from Flatulence and Dyspepsia.

Dramatic Truth
Somewhere between Louis Esson’s (R.P.
■l~> 3/’23) cry for “expressionism in drama,”
and Eardley Turner’s (R.P. 12/4/’23) vigor-
ous defence of the “well-made play,” there
may be a thought which perhaps only sug-
gests the cause of their difference of opinion,
if it does that much.
About 50 years ago Ibsen came striding
heavily into dramatic letters with a harsh
word in his mouth. Most of his Victorian
English contemporaries refused to listen to
him. The man was quite impossible. Ilis
women thought; his men were poor, dis-
honest, natural creatures, who did not domi-
nate even their indecently introspective
households; and the situations arising from
his sex-impact drivel were nauseating—and
typical of absolutely nothing, my dear fel-
low, except that the households were damn
badly run, which was notoriously to be ex-
pected outside England. It was new, of
course; and people (outside the club) were
rather fools about a new thing. But it
would pass.
Unhappily, the commentator was right—
it did pass. The word in the man’s hard
mouth was truth; and that was over the
odds altogether. William Archer carried on,
hammering away until, sub rosa and in
camera, a sort of half-hearing was vouch-
safed. In time, thin echoes rose up behind
the bastioned walls: Pinero, Henry Arthur
Jones, Sydney Grundy, Stanley Houghton-
clever, capable dramatists who could feed on
the edge of a rich psychological truth as well
as the next man. They did fairly well with
evening clothes and titles and a few tricks
left scattered about by Wilde; but they never
came within coo-ee of the spiritual truth
itself. The bleak beauty of Ibsen’s clear
thought was bedizened with topical tech-
nique, bedevilled with self-consciousness.
“The Second Mrs. Tanqueray” had to be a
sorrowful, confessedly introspective and un-
usual person; she couldn’t be th» ~
wife of an ordinary
she couldn’t no*-"
i?H* v, ‘ •

renter, of
•■•-.-se, . weight got through
_ v/i Shaw; but it was a personal
xosen delivered more in Shaw than in anger,
more in astounding brilliance of technique
and manner than in any impersonal sin-
cerity of matter.
Dramatically, England seems to have run
to the dead-end of a permanently-begged ques-
tion. In the other arts and sub-arts her
eyes appear to be losing gradually the film
of heavy consciousness; she is willing, at
least, to admit the possibility of something
in a straight demonstration of the thoughts,
impulses and lives behind the film. In
fiction she accepts and applauds a good mea-
sure of the truth, and in painting and sculp-
ture; in verse she is apparently hungry for
it, the nakeder the better. But on the
stage she is still desperately genteel. She
will come half-way and allow the characters
to speak and act truthfully to nature. But
when it comes to thinking truthfully she
smiles and begs the question with charm,
daintiness, plot, “drama,” skill in. technique,
any substitute which will co-ordinate with
the winey dinner she persists in believing
all her real subjects eat every night. Wilde
is still her limit despite Galsworthy and
Granville Barker and the hard fighting they
have done. When the periodical bouts of
fighting are over she sighs contentedly and
reverts to “Mr. Pim Passes By.”
That’s a fair go, naturally. She likes to
be amused after a good dinner, and is will-
ing to pay handsomely for it, as Eard'ey
Turner reminds us. But before the good
dinner she is just as willing to pay for
“Babbit,” “The Judge,” De la Mare’s verse,
John’s earlier pictures, Epstein’s marbles—
all the other expressions rising hopefully
from the, late discovery of plain truth. Yet
on the stage she is still consistently rigid;
just smiles, lapses comfortably on to Pinero’s
fabulous income, and lets it go at that.
Hence, as my suggestion sees it, the cause
of the difference of opinion between Esson
and Turner, the one holding aloft the proof
of the pudding and the other crying out that
the pudding isn’t worth a damn—hasn’t been
worth a damn this 30 years. Of course, it
isn’t; but it’s the only pudding there is.
No one took the torch of truth from great
Ibsen save Shaw, who promptly said it was
his and not truth’s, thereby automatically
destroying it psychologically. So we get no-
thing new, nothing worth while in the light
of the other arts’ advancement. We are 30
years behind the times in the theatre, 30
years behind the Germany, France Italy—
even the Spain—of to-day. And probably
we shall remain in that complacent cul-de-sac
until some dramatist takes his faith in his
hands and says: “I will crib technique and
‘drama’ from no one. My people shall think
straight, and from their thoughts their
actions and words and situations shall rse
naturally, as in Ibsen, half-a-century ago.
From that treasury of cold impersonal truth
which is feeding the other arts to-day I will
learn my business.” We might then get
a good pudding, good in both its eating and
its payable proof.
HILARY LOFTING.
Literature and Woman
We hear a lot from writers like Vance
Pnlmpr about sex-limitations; but how little
comprehended are such limitations when ap-
plied to themselves! They would be quite sur-
prised, would they not, to learn that when
they dip pen on this subject they are in
unknown territory, without much in the way
of a chart, and. furthermore, badly handi-
capped by that very limitation of which they
speak. That in itself would not'"be such an
insuperable bar if they could but realise that
they are yet contentedly remaining at the
stage of the freckled-nosed small boy at the
primary school, who elevates his small snub
when he condescends to enunciate the con-
temptuous word “Girls!” No more advanced,
in psychology, in humanhood, in insight!
I have been a woman for quite a while,
and am still looking for the female that is
aimed at by writers of this calibre. Not
pretending to their omniscience, I will not
say that, therefore, she does not exist; I can
only conclude that if she exists at all she is
to be found in the person of a dressmakers
apprentice, or is one of those befrizzled
young ladies who fall over themselves when
the shopwalker shouts “Forward !” I speak
even here with doubt, never having met this
kind except in the way of business. Perhaps
if I did I might find that she has at least
as fair a share of humanhood as the splen-
didly-attired person whose eye controls her
or as the individual opposite in the gent, s
hosiery, chewing gum and furtively collect-
ing tips for the races.
With respect, as from one gnashing teeth
in outer darkness, I must challenge the state-
ment that my sex is responsible for the dreary
output of tripe in the average magazine. I
do not say that this small Mallee township
from which I write is in any way typical,
yet it is worthy of note that when the Yel-
low, the Red, the Pea-green and whatnot
drift this way, it is the business-man, the
bank-accountant, the “commercial” who de-
vour them. My women-friends and I often won-
der when the men who write this trash will
wake up to the fact x that one wants to get
away sometimes from the eternal man-and-
girl episode. Why do we prefer the Ameri-
can short story? Simply because of the
broad interests dealt with there. (Of course,
I do not refer to hot-house stuff like the
Smart Set and the like.) Yet I have seen
American literature of every sort condemned
by some Bulletin writers as hopelessly
under the influence of the feminine! Per-
haps it is; hence its wholesome humanness.
But our own Randolph Bedford will have
none of fiction in which the sex-interest does
not predominate. “The man, the woman, the
baby,” he says, every time. Randolph Bed-
ford, who refers to all virtuous single women
as “sex-hungry” (a sex-myopic opinion),
seems to us women to blunder through life
and literature like an elephant in a bric-a-
brac bazaar. , ~ ,
The remark “R.H.” makes —that “when a
man wants a sensible companion be chooses
man” —leaves a nasty suspicion of the use
i which he puts the other half of the world,
'id he, I ponder,- ever try to get beyond
le barrier of sex to discover the undoubted
uth that, after all, woman is a real human
ing, with ambitions, yearnings, spiritual
pirations, scientific curiosity and multi-
iinous interests quite apart from sex? No,
leed; nor, having learnt it, will he believe
as he has allowed sex-egotism to cloud
ms vision and destroy his judgment. Yet,
having, as we know we have, all these com-
mon human desires, how does it affect our
self-respect to be told that our only excuse
for residing on this planet is our physical
sex-use? If “R.H.” is right, the Creator
made a large mistake here.
But self-respect is the last virtue that the
cave-man desires to see in a woman. The key-
note struck by such writers as Vance Palmer
and “R.H.” is a crude materialism, tinctured
by a flippant cocksureness. By all that
we reverence, let us keep it out of Austra-
lian literature.
CECIL WARREN.
The Face of Keats
Ihe National Portrait Gallery in London
has recently been enriched by a pencil por-
trait of John Keats, hitherto uncatalogued.
The donor is the grand-daughter of Charles
Armitage Brown, who made the sketch, and
it was sent by her from Maoriland, where it
had been for more than SO years.
The Browns were not a stay-at-home
family, and Charles—-“Armitage” was a later
addition —went into business in Russia in his
vouth. Before long he returned to England
financially ruined; but inheriting some
money from a brother who had settled m
Sumatra, he was enabled to indulge his
literary tastes. He wrote the libretto to a
serio-comic opera called “Narensky,” which
was performed at Drury-lane in 1814, and
not long afterwards made the acquaintance
of Keats. Brown shared a house in Hamp-
stead, then known as Wentworth-place, with
Charles Wentworth Dilke —a quaint house
still standing in a quainter garden. Thither
Keats removed after the death of his brother
from consumption in their lodgings further
up the hill. And though his stay was short,
yet the most passionate and critical moments
of his life were spent under Brown’s roof.
After the death of Keats in Rome, Brown
spent most of his life in Italy, where he
knew both Byron and Landor. He studied
Italian and the Italian poets, and d : d a
good deal of literary work. He published a
volume upon the sonnets of Shakspeare,
wherein he enunciated the theory—later
developed by Miss Clemence Dane —that the
story of Shakspeare’s own life may be
through the lines of .his poetry. In 1841
Brown went out to join his son in Taranaki,
Maoriland. He was, however, d : sappointed
in the country, and actually wrote to Joseph
Severn —whose own well-known but posthu-
mous portrait of Keats shows him sitting in
a room of Brown’s house —announcing his
intention of returning to England. Before
he could do so he died, and was buried near
New Plymouth, where his grave, lost during
the Maori wars, has been lately rediscovered.
Brown took with him to Maoriland many
relics of Keats. He had intended writing
his biography, but eventually gave his manu-
scripts to Richard Monckton Milnes. Long
after his death, his son, Major Brown, sent
many volumes which had beloneed to Keats,
and other memorials, to Sir Charles Dilke,
and they form part of the Keats collection in
Hampstead, London. The portrait in ques-
tion —which shows the poet’s face in profile,
his cheek leaning upon his hand —ev : dently
remained in possession of the Brown family,
and there is no description of it in the pub-
lished record of Keats portraits. Last year
the fact of its existence in Maoriland was
made known £o the English world of letters
by Sir S’dney Colvin in the London Obser-
ver. which gave a reproduction of the sketch,
with the statement that it was there pub-
lished for the first time—a statement which
was subsequenly refuted in a letter by Angus
Wilson, a Maoriland journalist in London.
It was indeed another Maorilander, Hector

course of an article in Art in Australia.
Sir Sidney Colvin was, of course, ignorant of
these facts, or he would have been the first

DORA WILCOX.
In Defence of a Classic
_l_ don't know why “C. McL.” (R.P.
17/5/’23) alludes to the immortal Gio-
vanni di Boccaccio da Chellino as a
poet with a low mind. Although he wrote
the “Amorosa Visione,” the “Ninfale Fieso-
lane’’ and other stories in verse, his title to
undying fame is the fact that he was the
creator of Italian prose. Even Dryden, who
preferred Chaucer to Boccaccio, says that
“the reformation of Italian prose was wholly
due to Boccaccio, who is yet the standard of
purity in the Italian tongue/’
If Boccaccio’s tales had not been written
we would have been deprived of some of the
best of Shakspeare—“All’s Well that Ends
Well” and “Cymbeline” occur to me—a great
deal of Chaucer and one-fourth of La Fon-
taine’s entrancing “Contes et Nouvelles.”
Twenty-two tales out of the eighty are bor-
rowed directly from Boccaccio. It is refresh-
ing to find the best stories retold in the en-
chanting verse of La Fontaine, though, to
be sure,, one requires a special vocabulary
and an intimate knowledge of the article on
the poet in Anatole France’s “Le Genie
Latin” to make much headway. Margaret
of Navarre was deeply versed in the lore of
Boccaccio, and had not death intervened she
would have finished her Decameron in imita-
tion of him. As it was, she got as far as
the “Seventh Day”—hence the name “Hep-
tameron.” “C.McL.” should read the won-
derful defence that Boccaccio put up in the
beginning of the “Fourth Day.” It is entitled
“To My Censors,” and in it he tells us that
his persecutors advised him to go and live
with the Muses on Parnassus, and leave prose
alone. It was not so easy to live with the
Muses, and they were not always in the
humor to be lived with, Boccaccio replied. He
received the Muses very occasionally in his
“Decameron,” and endeavored to get away
from them altogether. Women, who wei'e of
the same sex as the Muses,, attracted him
much more. He had received inspiration
from them, but none from the Muses.
It was lucky for the world that Boccaccio
did not go on writing verses. He knew what
he was best fitted for, and his enemies did
not; so, although he could not escape their
venom, he went on writing prose. He got
some consolation from the fact that it was
only poor writers whom jealous rivals left
in peace.. Similarly La Fontaine could never
get-permission to publish in France his fourth
book of “Contes.” The police intervened on
the score of indecency. The same persecu-
tion was extended in after years to Flaubert,
Baudelaire and the brothers De Goncourt.
They are all extensively read to-day.
If Boccaccio was a bit wi’d in his youth he
made up for it by the piety of his later years.
He read and commented upon the “Divine
Comedy” in public, wrote a Life of Dante
and. published his “Commento sopra la Com-
inedia” in 1373. I cannot find anything about
his illegitimacy, but it is said that Fiametta
(Flamette) was Maria d’Aquino, the natural
daughter of Robert* King of Naples; but an-
other and more likely yarn is that she was
Jeanne, Queen of Naples and Jerusalem.
L. G. D.
Dionysos v. Archaism
.Tack Lindsay in defence of “Hellenism”:
I agree completely with all “J.8.D.” (B. 24/5/’23)
has to say about the cant of deifying the past. The
alabaster jars with several handles found in Tutank-
hamen’s tomb, for example, are no more beautiful
than the pipes in a refrigerating chamber. Irish
kings, pyramids, scarabs, etc., are similar primitive
productions that have no significance for the modern
world. Our appeal in Vision for a Hellenic vision
of life has nothing to do with a return to a few 1
archaistie attitudes in life or art. Indeed it is
primarily directed towards attacking the modern
cults of Primitivism which have obtained so strong a
hold on the other side of the world. Here we do
not realise how much all expressions there have
returned to imitation of archaic forms. Epstein, ns
one example, imitates any savage model from Egyp-
tian to Samoan carvings.
“J.8.D.” seems to think that by Hellenism we
mean an attempt to resuscitate the Greek state
and the wearing of chiton or chlamys, a childish
playing with the wardrobes of life. By Hellenism
we mean not a thing but the element of mental
exaltation that accepts Life, as opposed to the Primi-
tivism which expresses either rage or hate for it, as
in Dante, or resignation to it, as in Dostoievsky. Hel-
lenism is all that has strength to face terror and
questioning; to leap into the abyss; to create a
beauty out of the material of earth that surpasses
earth ; to have courage for the spectacle of Man, and
by that courage to seek in him immortal elements of
beauty.
“Cant!” replies the inexorable “J.8.D.” How-
ever, it is true, because the Greek did it.
I advocated no return to the Greek world. English
poetry is greater than Greek poetry, but it is a
direct growth out of the Greek spirit. “J.8.D.”
ignores the fact that I said Shakspeare was more
Greek than the Greeks. All imagery of passion, all
poetry that seeks to define a concrete vision of emo-
tion in action, goes back to the Greek, because the
first definition of man was made here. The first, I
say, not the last. I said that the Greek— i.c., any
poetic vision that seeks to construct a world of vital
forms —would not come to birth by the mere writing
of Olympian hymns, but. by “a profound response to
Life, by the expression of a lyric gaiety, by a pas-
sionate sensuality, by the endless search for the
image of beauty, the immortal body of desire.”
AVe used the names of the Greek gods only because,
since in them is projected for the first and only time
an image of Man as divinity, they must remain as
symbols for all who continue to seek . divinity in
Man and not in 'abstractions. If we invented a new
god, called, say, XYZ, it would no doubt seem novel,
but the only real novelty is a new image of emotion.
“J.8.D.” considers Aristophanes merely a reaction-
ary Tory. I put Aristophanes against Bernard Shaw-
because there is no better test than these two for
gauging the vitality of a mind. G.B.S. is only a
mechanism for witticisms on the social system. But.
Aristophanes is a lyric poet with humor, fantasy and
real power to draw’ women; he has a deep sense of
delight in life. I do not consider Aristophanes
young because he jeered, but because he wrote the
splendid comedy of the Lvsistrata. G.B.S. has not
even a single actual woman let alone a vital one;
he has no real contact with Life at all.
Does “J.8.D.” seriously think we advocate a
Dionysiac ritual? Dionysos (the “pedantic” form : : s
used as part of a growing revolt against the Latinisa-
tion of Greek words) is a symbol of the mental desire
for a bacchanalia, which has little to do with the
actual debauch of life. The simple savage who gets
drunk is the last person to project an image of the
debauch, and it is in the mental image that the
Dionysiac recoil from life lies. What has Beethoven
whose music is saturated with the bacchanalian
spirit to do with a robber Baron?
Here, then, I make a direct' denial of the statement
by “J.8.D.” that Dionysos has any relation whatso-
ever to the Egyptian nursery horses lately found. The
latter arc unmeaning hieroglyphics; Dionysos is com-
pact of flesh and blood.
The reference to “As You Like It” would make 't
appear that “J.8.D.” has hurriedly looked through
his Shakspeare to find a play with a setting that
might be called contemporary. If he imagines that
the Forest of Arden with its Phoebes and exiled
Dukes and the gay lasciviousness of the wooing c.f
Rosalind ever existed anywhere, then the least I can
say is that he has a weird conception of actuality.
1 am interested to learn from “J.8.D.” that Shaks-
peare only wrote “Antony and Cleopatra” and not a
“Vanity Fair” because of t>e fashion of the day!
In the kingdom of the gods the one-eyed man is
automatically ejected, and I am afraid “J.8.D.” has
never cried like Antony that he will find “new
heavens, new earth,” for love. Otherwise he would
not insult Shakspeare thus.
It is well that opacity is its own protection, or
one note of the unquenchable laughter of the gods
would sweep it out of existence. However, as it is,
the opaque one readjusts his spectacles and returns
to the serious work of invoicing collars and studs.
What else can the social system stand for than per-
sonal security and the filling of the belly! No
one denies that these are necessary thing, but how in
the name of all the syllogisms can they be ends in
themselves ? Man begins to live as a mind when
he begins to project an image of himself, to realise
something of self-revelation. If you find your goal
in getting security and a full belly, at least be
shameless enough to do so without protestations and
don’t interfere with those who seek the only other
goal—Self. The symbol of Self is realised in its
simplest and vaguest form by those who represent the
surface actions of emotion in contact with the social
system: these are the novelists and minor poets.
For vague minds to visualise themselves even in
relation to the actual world they live in is a tre-
mendous effort, and it is no wonder that they dis-
like all that seeks to set a further goal still, to
destroy all complacence, and turn to the difficult and
infinite task of defining the essence of self instead of
the comparatively easy problem of seeing man in terms
of his environment. It is for this that Poetry stands
(I mean, of course, all poetry with its roots really
in passion and sensation), and that is why poetry
must always invoke resentment and impatience from
the vague minds who think they are the solid and
concrete ones because they can imagine nothing they
cannot see or hear. But since those minds have
no inner world ■ they are really flimsy and misty,
while the poet with his mental world apparently
far removed from actuality is really the stable and
full mind.
The last thing I would wish to do is to set the
whole underworld of minor poets gabbling of Mitvlene
and Anactoria, like the Nineties. I don’t care if
there is never a single mention of a single Greek
name. I only invoked the gods to send Australia
minds with power to construct a passionate and con-
crete vision of life. And to do this Babylonian
imagery is needed to build the great structures of our
imagination, and all the textures and colors of all
the ages to give it adequate emphasis. When a
suburban fence holds in all the setting necessary for
the ardors and adventures of the human soul, let
short-sighted novelists peer at life through a pair
of spectacles. But while deeper powers call for
utterance, I prefer to dance with the gods of Beetho-
ven and love with Antony and Cleopatra.
The Black-and-White Trade
Remarks appear eccasionally finding fault
with artists for not drawing axes, guns,
ploughs, bullock-teams, saws, saddles, knives,
scissors, spades, shovels, carts and a thousand
and one other items in a correct way. These
critics say artists never draw some of these
things correctly, and in some cases they are
right. I know one artist who cannot draw’ an
«raxe, and I know another who nearly wrecked
his life by drawing a bullock-driver on his
w’rong side. Some of the craft up-country
forwarded him a letter of protest, w'hich up-
set him so much that the next week, having
to draw a picture of a man getting on a
horse, he forgot to add stirrups to the saddle.
Then there are the people who hate being
drawn for the papers. They never knovv how T
the artist got the sketch; had they known
about it they would never have allowed-it to
go in—as if they could have prevented it!
An artist for a Melbourne journal was draw-
ing a collection of well-known business heads,
and while making sketches ran up against a
snag. This one couldn’t stand such a thing
—absolutely impossible—never sought pub-
licity—didn’t care for that sort of self-
advertising. After a lot of pleading and leg-
pulling, the caricaturist received permission
to make a drawing; but the victim kept- up
a hurt kind of attitude while it was being
done, and the artist -left with the feelitigs of
a man w r ho had dragged something from
someone who hated giving it. The sketch he-
made was not a good one, so the artist left
this man out —and the paper had hardly
been published before he ’phoned up and
wanted to know w’hy his picture had been
omitted.
I remember a case of my own. I called
on a man to make a drawing of him, and he
w’as very tickled. He brushed his suit,
combed his hair and, after giving himself a
final overhaul before the mirror, w r as ready
for me. I did the drawing and it appeared
—and then the man who had combed his
hair and fixed his tie told people who hap-
pened to be my friends that had he known
he was being drawn he would have put the
young scoundrel who did it off the premises.
Still, there are some people who frankly
love publicity—we have all met the man
who asks us to put some “him” in Tiie
Bulletin, and w’e all have met those people
who think that one glance from an artist is
a sure sign that their picture will be in the
next issue. Then there is the man who feels
that “a few bob” will do the trick, and when
he is told that it’s not done that way won-
ders W’hat’s wrong with the world.
One of David Lowe’s victims was a well-
known Tasmanian. He made it a condition
of the sitting that Low should show him the
rough sketch when he had finished it; if he
liked the drawing, he would allow him to put
it in The Bulletin, but if he did not
approve of the drawing he was to tear it up.
Low agreed, and when the sketch was fin-
ished tiie celebrity took hold of it and him-
self tore it to pieces. But the caricaturist’s
pencil is a cruel weapon sometimes; and
Low made sure that the drawing which he
did straight away from memory w r as a good
one—and it was ; terribly good.
I drew Hughes for The Bulletin in days
long before he rose to his topmost heights of
fame. “Where would you like me—-on the
floor of the House?” asked Billy. “Yes,” I
replied. “Go into the Press box,” he said,
4 an d I will stand beside the table. As soon
as you have finished, gave me a nod.” I
agreed, and off we went. I sat up in the
1 ress box and Hughes fussed about with
some papers. After a few minutes Billv
looked up, and I shook my head. Billy
patiently returned to his papers, and made a
great pretence of saving the country till the
job was finished. As I have never thanked
I t&k? this opportunity of doing so.
Getting back to the bullock teams and the
BPades and the axes, I think we do very well,
all things considered. At a moment’s notice an
artist has to draw anything from all the things
that are in the world. He cannot memorise the
universe, and he has not the time to go out
and look for a bullock team. Occasionallv
luck comes one’s way. Low had to do a
lull-page Bulletin cartoon showing a steam-
roller. He had no pictures of one, and couldn’t
remember the beast’s likeness, so he rang
up the Melbourne City Council and asked if
it could tell him where he could see one.
Ihe man in charge, recognising the import-
ance ot the cartoonist and his job, said he
would have much pleasure in sending one
around to the studio—which he did. It was
not long before a spluttering, shuffling steam
roller came down Little Collins-street and
stopped outside the building—and the draw-
ing of that steam roller was a classic. But
I have never heard of a man having the like
luck with a bullock team. There is a long-
telt want here; and some critic should start
in abd establish an Artists’ Supply Depot,
where one could get models of everything—
bar women. We can supply them ourselves.

,, V^ e x,? ea l, Kook of Victorian Art (Alexander
McCubbin Melbourne). A first and promising- issue
ot a useful and artistic annual, which aims at pre-
senting- a resume of the year’s sesthetic progress in
the southern State, with a list of exhibitions and a
directory of artists, art societies, galleries, etc.
there are seven 0 r eight reproductions in color, which
iii reach perfection, and a number of ex-
cellent half-tones.
The Clockwork Man, by E. V. Odle (Heinemann).
{something went wrong with his works, and that is
how he came to butt into the cricket match at Great
Wymering. A cog bad slipped, and he fell back
about &000 years—-into a period when he wasn’t
understood, and had only a vague memory of having
heard that once on the earth there were people like
we are. Mr. Odle’s fantastic invention reminds one
of James Edmond’s. But he hasn’t James Edmond’s
humor and extraordinary fluency.
Children of the Dawn, by Mary Carbery (Heine-
mann). In the mythical days after the Children
ot the Dawn had come from Thebes to Eire, the
Archpriest of the Druids lived in Tara’s halls. To
Ross then came Father Shamas as Chief Druid, deter-
mined to have no truck with native superstitions;
and this is the tale-of how native superstitions with
a club behind them made things very uncomfortable
for Father Shamas. It is a romantic setting, of
course; but there is enough brutality in it to sug-
gest that romance in those days was likely to have a
sudden and messy end. But it is all well off the
beaten track, and the interest never flags.
Ponga Bay, by Sophie Osmond (Hutchinson). A
pleasant mixture of adventure and Maori history of
the time when the colony Was in its infancy, and the
original dwellers of the Shivery Isles had virtues that
made them staunch friends and respected enemies.
The aristocratic characters of the book are not
drawn with too sure a touch, but this is more than
compensated for by the thrills of the narrative. The
rescue of Kendal Stone, an English officer, from the
warm underground stream into which he is thrown
is in the approved Haggard style. Color is abun-
dant ; and altogether Miss Osmond, who has “An
Australian Wooing” to her credit, has made a praise-
worthy effort to render vivid clays that were by no
means unromantic.
Men, Maids and Mustard Pot, by Gilbert Frankau
(Hutchinson). In the first paragraph of the first of
this collection of stories you find the author bound-
ing ahead like this: “Since the unsophisticated reader,
misled by modern slang, may be inclined to
visualise any character, even the heaviest of Heavy
Cavalry officers, who rejoices in the nickname of
‘Beaver as a razorless old curmudgeon at whose
hirsute facial appanages irreverent small boys point
the scornful (and point-scoring) finger, it seems neces-
sary to explain, at the very outset of this veracious
story, that Major the Honorable Mortimer Mullins,
D. 5.0., M.C., etc.”... .Frankau has evidently been
ruined by success, let us hope only temporarily. The
yarns are of average magazine character, but one
requires patience to hunt down the plot in the
forest of words.
Australian Cotton —Its Growth and Consequence,
by Nicholas Dillon Healy (Australasian Publishing
Co.). An attempt, prefaces the author, “to present
in as concise and clear a compass as possible the
vast and varied body of experiences extending over
nearly a century and a half of American cotton-
growing,” the purpose, it is added, being not so
much to stress the potentialities of cotton-growing
in Australia as to supply data and details that wili
be useful to those embarking in an industry of
which so much is expected. The handbook tells of
the cotton plant and how to grow and bale it, and
of pests and diseases, the last section being specially
informative. The worst of the pests arc so far
unknown in Australia, but if Mr, Healy’s book had
been published a little later he would have been
forced to make an exception of the pink boll-worm,
which is already widely diffused in native vegetation,
to which it has apparently spread from experimental
cotton plots, in the Broome district of W.A.
Stabilisation: An Economic Policy for Producers
and Consumers, by E. M. H. Lloyd (Allen and Un-
win). This well-known writer is opposed to the
deflation to which most orthodox economists are
committed. “The evil of inflation is that it raises
prices. The evil of deflation is that it causes unem-
ployment.” There are three alternatives —inflation,
deflation, stabilisation; a rise in prices, a fall in
prices, and stability of prices. Mr. Lloyd can see
no hope except in stabilisation; but he goes further
than Professor Cassel, and insists that stabilisation
of the currency will not be enough to prevent violent
fluctuations in the necessary-commodity markets.
From our own Bawra he draws much comfort. It
showed what can be accomplished in the way of
“orderly marketing.” But he admits that nothing
of great moment can be done without international
action; and, however desirable that may be, the
difficulties in the way are tremendous. Incidentally,
Mr. Lloyd discusses the Australian wheat pools. “The
problem of British agriculture, like the problem of
British coal, is an international and not a national
problem. If we desire to give stability and security
to British wheat-growers we can only do so by co-
operating with Canada, Australia and other wheat-
exporting countries whose Governments find it desir-
able to try to achieve the same objects.’” So he
suggests an international wheat pool; “the object
would be to reduce price-fluctuations to the mini-
mum by holding large reserve stocks and meeting
seasonal and even cyclical variations in demand by
increasing or decreasing its reserves.” As for the
difficulties of storage, in Australia “the loss froiq,
rats and deterioration was far less than had been
expected.” Whether it was rats or mice isn’t of
much consequence; it would have been more interest-
ing had Mr. Lloyd shown just how the producer
would benefit in the long run. Stabilised prices are
all very well; but when the Australian grower has
a bad season and a poor crop he wants a high price,
and under present conditions he can generally get
it, even though Canada/ may that year have had a
very big crop. Distance and freights protect him.


“LOMAX” Lamp Holders
(Patent 178661)
WIRED IN LESS THAN HALF THE TIME.
* V-
METHOD OF FIXING.
1. Cap and top ring are passed up flexible
cord, bared ends of which are passed
upwards through small holes in porcelain
interior.
2. Heads of terminals are raised by thumb
and finger, at same time releasing spring
pull by pressing plungers upwards.
3. Bared wires are coiled round pins under
heads, which on being released grip wires
against porcelain.
4. Flexible cords are then passed upwards
through axial slots, liner is brought over
into position, and cap screwed down firmly
by means of top ring.
â
PARTICULAR FEATURES
Screws eliminated, also cost of holder maintenance.
No tools required.
Springs carry no current, making holder particularly suitable
for gas-filled lamps.
Flex will break before cord grip will give.
Larger area of conductor gripped than by screw point contacts.
Binding of cap, when in position on the heads of the terminals,
prevents heads being raised when a lamp is inserted or
taken out.
It is impossible to replace interior without bringing terminals
into proper position.
Wired quicker than any lampholder on the market, the saving
in time being well over 50 per cent.

Song- of Content in Hell.
Bane of my heart, if you and I should be
At last together by the infinite sea
That lies past Space and Time, and reaches
to
Unthinkable horizons, and if you
Turned to me then, the last man left, to see
Your pampered body’s grace and witchery,
And, seeing me, should murmur, “I’ll be
true
And k.ss no other man, whatever befall!” —
Dear God! d’ye think I should believe in
you
And your glib lies at all?
Shame of my soul, if I should meet you there,
If I in my intolerable despair
Should at the last oe left w.th you for mate,
’Mid solitude limitless and inveterate,
I’d mock your harlot spell, and, shred by
shred,
Dissect it, till your vanity was dead.
I’d show how even to lust you never were
true,
And how your falseness made the devils weep.
Then with these hands I’d make an end of
you,
And God might grant me sleep.

Our spirits, beckoning like a clear white
star,
Brooding above us in a night of fears,
Setting our souls where God’s high visions
are.
There has been love between us—the keen
love
When thought kissed thought and brain
enraptured brain,
The flashing loves of laughter and of words,
And dreams that scarred life’s lips with
splendid pain.

Rain-Hunger.
I have forgotten!
I have forgotten how
The white rains sing along the flower-sheaves,
The silky obligato in the leaves
Of ravished roses blown
From briar and bough.
I have forgotten!
Thin showers soft and cool,
The lengthening beads that drop from silver
strings.
And make the ever-widening ripple-rings
In purple-shadowed pond
And dancing pool. .
I have forgotten !
I would remember now
Wild nights by misty lake or black lagoon,
Where streaked with silver slants the broken
moon
Trails in the watery waste
A crooked prow.
I would remember
A white face in the rain,
Hung there ’twixt blotted earth and swollen
skies,
With tangled hair, and terrible dark eyes,
Blinded with Love’s desire
And young-old pain!
I have forgotten—
Forgotten how we stood
Sw’aying among the rain-wet river-reeds,
Our feet entangled in the slimy weeds
And the wind singing past
Us to the wood.
I have forgotten—
Forgotten all the sweet!
And, hark, when once the long-pent rains
shall come,
Naught shall I hear through all that throb
and thrum—
Naught but the swishing sigh
Of passed-on feet!

Remembering.
I wonder if you wake
To fold an arm about her slenderness
With that soft whisper only midnight hears,
While little winds that have a sound of rain
Make scraping fingers of the paw-paw tree
Against the wall that hides the garden place;
And by the rose-bush whose great aureate
flowers
You picked for me some hushed and feathered
thing
Twitters, and Sleeps again. The broken cloud
Drifts on a waning moon. How many moons
Since you vowed hotly with your lips on
mine?
Scarce has this moon had time to quite for-
get.-
Even the rose recalls when, as a bud
You leaned above it, still with thoughts of
me.
The camphor laurel, lovely with the rain,
Glistens beside the deep., eclips'ng gloom
Of mango boughs; the dipt and matted grass
Deadens the drippings from the sodden
branch.
Beating like pixy footfalls through the
blades;
And down the muteness of the country road
Old ghosts could pace, hand-linked with
memory.
I wonder if you wake. Here, all alone
I lie and wait for dawn, remembering.
QUEENSLAND.

THE PRIME MINISTER AND THE
DIGGERS.
The scandalised astonishment recently ex-
pressed by the Prime Minister when the
R. S. and S. I. League protested against
some of his Government’s appointments
was characteristic. If the United Haber-
dashers or the League of Grocers had used
similar language, Mr. Bruce Would have
found it quite tolerable. The remarks made
about him by the Orange I.edges for letting
the Irish envoys land, and about the King
for visiting the Pope, were much more offen-
sive, and far less justified, than anything
the soldiers said in connection with the
Ryan matter. He accepted the violent
Orange resolutions without protest, because
the persons responsible had not been soldiers.
His arrogance towards the R. S. and S. I.
League goes deeper than the fact that the
fighting-men are too effectively divided at
present to be a political menace: he cannot
forget he was once a captain, and he cannot
understand how their representatives can
forget they were once soldiers. The first
essential in a good officer was that he should
“look after his men”—and he (Bruce) was
a good officer. How can a League, 90 per
cent, of whose members have had the experi-
ence of being looked after by good officers.
imagine that it has anything to fear when
an ex-captain orders it to leave everything
to him and his friends? Such, clearly, is
Bruce's process of reasoning, and he is
not to be blamed for it. The army machine
caught him young, and he has not had time
to forget fallacies which some are never able
to forget.
* * * *
Of all the impostures of that colossal piece
of hypocrisy which is personified by a nation
in arms, none was more transparent than
the fiction that Authority, in the shape of
an officer, looked after the humble fighting-
man, partly out of love of the latter’s bright
eyes, and partly on spiritual grounds. A
competent C.O. rarely let his unit go long
without hearing about the obligation it was
under to those officers who were ready
always to make sacrifices of time, comfort
and even food in the interests of the “other
ranks.” And so providentially devoid of
reasoning powers are armies in the face of
an enemy that most of the men took such
protestations at their face value, just as
they believed the promises of those in autho-
rity at home about the rewards the soldiers
would return to when by their sacrifices
they had “saved the world for freedom.”
Actually, the best of officers did no more for
his men, day in, day out, than any peace
time horse-trainer is prepared to do for a
Cup favorite. The soldiers themselves did
as much for their rifles and bayonets, and
made no song about it. That is to say, they
did not claim self-rigliteously to love these
weapons; and they did not suggest that by
keeping them cleaned, oiled and generally
as lethal as possible they were performing a
moral action. The average officer’s indiffer-
ence to his men, except as instruments for
the attainment of certain objectives, shouts
from every unbiased war-book of the past five
years. The shooting of boys who were tem-
peramentally incapable of facing shellfire;
the dragging of bound “conchies” along duck-
boards ; the scandalous misuse of the Court-
Martial system ; the denial to the soldier of
the right to state his real grievances anywhe: e
but in a quarter which he knew would flout
them —-these were among the features of
Army life that might have been witnessed ary
day in Flanders . for four years from the
end of 1914. During these perilous times offi-
cers certainly looked after their men, in the
material sense : they would have neglected
the duty at their peril. Everyone was doing
it. Preference to soldiers was not an ab-
straction to be argued about: it was a creed
that only traitors denied. During the 1917
food-shortage women and children went with-
out meat in England, so that their defenders
might have plenty. Society girls were proud
to wait on soldiers in Y.M.C.A. huts, or
scrub floors in hospitals, where soldiers lay
wounded, or work in Comforts Fund or Red
Cross depdts, or do anything else of a menial
nature to prove their gratitude to those who
were fighting, amongst other things, for the
fortunes of the privileged classes. Some of
the men were stupid enough to misunder-
stand these manifestations, as thev misunder-
stood the concern for their health shown by
their officers. They believed that a miracle
had happened; that class distinctions, sec-
tarian hatreds and all the rest were gone
forever; that henceforth men would be
appraised on the basis of their services to
the Empire, and that there would be no
place for those who had shirked. The majo-
rity, of course, were not so credulous. But
they did believe that the promises made by
every responsible politician, endorsed by
every decent newspaper, and roared to ap-
proving multitudes by every Empire-Day
orator who was not temporarily out of the
patriotic business on account of its obliga-
tions as regards enlistment, would be more
or less honored. It is this misconception
that was to blame for the recent rift between
the Prime Minister and the R. S. League.
* * * •
More and more the community is getting
back to the comfortable old view that “the
sojer’s wage is honor.” Many employers are
still prepared—especially on Empire Day,
Anzac Day, etc. —to resuscitate the old catch-
words about “deathless heroism” and “a
nation’s eternal gratitude to the men who
fought and suffered”; but when it comes to
giving a hero a job in preference to an appli-
cant who bears no resemblance whatever to
a hero, the point is taken that a good patriot
is not necessarily a good employee. The sol-
diers, during the years of disillusionment that
succeeded the Armistice, have jettisoned one
claim after another, till they have reached
bedrock with the almost ridiculously humble
contention that, at least, they should have
preference over those who did not serve,
“where other things are equal.” Their pro-
tests against the recent appointments by the
Government of men who were not returned
soldiers to billets for which plenty of suitable
returned men had offered, were not dictated
by personal feeling against the appointees.
The prevailing sentiment was a matter of
blank consternation that the Government of
Australia should have given such a lead at a
time when thousands of unpatriotic employers
are only too anxious to dishonor even the least
of the promises made to the Diggers in the
war-years. “Dogs! Would ye live forever?”
cried Fkederick the Great, in stupefaction
at the spectacle of his soldiers retiring; and
some such query rises in the minds of many
an Australian junker when importuned by
men who, as soldiers, were not wont to
retire. If this spirit is to be laid, and the
Diggers are to avoid the fate that has over-
taken returned soldiers in all the Empire’s
other wars, the R. S. and S. I. League will
have to be vastly strengthened. It induced
the Bruce-Page Government to adopt a more
reasonable tone last week, not because of
the menace it is, but because of the menace
it still may be. Its potentialities for danger,
and its corresponding powers to stand up
for the Diggers, were disclosed the instant
it revealed an unaccustomed readiness to tell
Authority the truth about itself. If the League
can maintain that form, if it can acquire at
long last the capacity to understand that Gov-
ernment officials, like army officers, have their
careers to make and think little of the in-
terests of others in the procqgs, it will grow
in numerical and moral strength to such pur-
pose that no admin’stration or iustitut’on or
private individual will be rash enough to
defy its legitimate requests. If it drifts
to its old snineless attitude when tackled
by Nationalist Ministers—that of a base-
camp adjutant in the presence of his C.O.— r
it will be ruined, and the Diggers’ last hopes
of enforcing recognition of their rights with
it.
BIG LOANS AND OTHER AIDS TO
REVOLUTION.
Do the gentlemen who are running the loan
policy of this country, now swollen to stu-
pendous dimensions, ever picture themselves
as revolution-makers, and possibly as the
makers of gory revolution? Most of them
are quiet and eminently respectable, and
some are even stodgy. They don’t look
(especially Bruce doesn’t look) at all like
Marat. Yet they are all helpers and sowers
of the seed. These six States, during the
last two financial years, added practically
£45,000,000 per annum to their aggregate
debts. When this year is finished tile result
is expected to be much the same. By dint
of charging up many roads, bridges, schools
and schoof repairs, post offices and post-
office repairs, aiso the usual railways and
land “settlement,” to loans, there are already
in view £45,000,000-per-annum loan pro-
grammes for at least three years ahead.
After that, unless the loan market has burst,
Providence will doubtless be good and fur-
nish more programmes. The fetate debts
about doubled in the 20 years to 1920. The
pace having increased fourfold, they promise
to double again in about 10 years. It might
be expected to occur to Bruce and Dawson and
Puller as something sinister that their loan
devices are the only part of their policy
which receives cordial support in the worst
quarters. The reddest revolutionaries and
the maddest Bolsheviks and the most trea-
sonable pro-Huns approve of it almost with
tears in their eyes, and want more of it.
The well-clothed rulers have no fear. They
have the assurance of that typical and wide-
spread authority, Podsnap Australis, that,
though unlimited extravagance always leads
other nations to chaos, it won’t have that
effect on Australia, because the Australian
is unlike other men. “None of us,” says
Podsnap Australis, “will ever see a revolu-
tion in Australia,” and this despite the fact
that the pretty well-defined beginnings of one
are visible in Queensland, and that the whole
thing in its worst form is on the programme
of a party which may be in power almost
any day. The not-so-well-tailored rulers-to-
be have no fear either, but they have a good
deal of hope. They reckon that the ultra-
respectables are doing their work better than
they could do it themselves, because the sort
of people who refuse to lend to, say, Theo-
dore, Will lend to, say, Puller. Wherefore
Puller may bring on the climax earlier
than Theodore could.
* * * •
The best material for revolution-making
is an ignorant and degraded working class
suffering from poverty, a sense of wrong and
a feeling of helplessness as far as concerns
getting redress by lawful means. An igno-
rant working class has been, and is being,
cultivated more assiduously in Australia
than in most white man’s countries—it is
probably safe to say more than in any other
white man’s country. The supreme essen-
tial of education, which is thorough know-
ledge of a skilled trade, is becoming almost
unknown except among imported men. The
beginnings of the Great Ignorance were
made when Labor succeeded in having rigid
restrictions put on apprenticeship, with the
idea that it would be better for the old man
if his son, the inheritor of his debts, grew
up to be a loafer or an odd-jobber. Then it
became an article of policy to push up the
wages of the unskilled to the level of the
expert, because the unskilled had become a
vast political power, and this also tended to
make the acquisition of a trade a matter of
surplusage. And both parties piled up debts
higher and higher and faster and faster,
really to “absorb the unemployed,” who are
also the unskilled, and, incidentally, to foster
and multiply the unskilled and the prospec-
tive unemployed. The galling sense of degra-
dation goes with the ignorance. No large
body of men, even if they don’t analyse their
feelings, can avoid being degraded and
auimalised by the knowledge that they have
nothing more to sell in return for their keep
than the cart-horse or the galley-slave has,
namely, brute strength. The arrival of sud-
den and bitter poverty can be foretold with
certainty unless the crazed potentates of the
land become blessed with unexpected intelli-
gence. The present debt of the Common-
wealth is about 950 millions, which is a lia-
bility of about 10s. on each acre, including
the surface of all the thousand dry salt
“lakes.” Twenty years of the present pace
would double it, making the liability £1 per
acre. There is bound to be an awakening
—from the lender’s point of view, anyhow;
and such awakenings are always sudden.
The collapse of even a £5,000,000-per-annum
foreign-loan policy would make trouble, for
that sum pays a lot of wages. If it changed
hands once a month it would pay £60,000,000
of salary a year. The collapse of a policy
nine times the size would be unspeakable,
and is much more probable, because of its
size. The class which has been trained to
live on loan jobs would feel that its vested
interest had been confiscated—would feel it
just as much as if its freehold farm was
taken from it. Other classes would give
way to unreasoning rage on more general
grounds. They have been told a million
times that this is a land of unlimited
natural resources. It has become an article
of faith that these resources are so terrific
that no one need be poor unless the rulers
are in malevolent conspiracy against the
common good, and deserve to be hanged; or
unless the whole social system is rotten and
diseased and deserves to be burned. So
there will be a tendency to take one course
or the^other —or both, so as to make certain.
From the standpoint of that self-satisfied
citizen Podsnap Australis, complete safe-
guards against revolution exist in the Aus-
tralian’s self-reliance, which is said to be
as phenomenal as his boundless natural re-
sources, his independence of thought and
his sturdy commonsense. As regards the
self-reliance, there is probably not one com-
munity in the world which leans more on the
Government, in both large things and small,
than that of Australia; and there are cer-
tainly no Governments which lean so much
on the money-lender as Australia’s. If lean-
ing is a sign of self-reliance this country has
got the virtue badly. In the matter of inde-
pendence of thought, Australia is the only
country, so far as is generally known, where
Labor has adopted the Russian “Red Objec-
tive,” just because Labor’s bosses, who drill
it very much as a Prussian drill-sergeant of
other days did his recruits, told it to do so.
Even Russia took the “Objective” at the
point of the bayonet. Allegedly strong
leaders like Dooley bowed beneath the
yoke like the rank and file. It is
constancy alleged that the adoption of
the Moscow policy is the work of
a handful of ‘‘extremists.” If the great
majority are against it, that says much for
their wisdom; but at the same time their
subservience to the few “extremists” blows
?i Ut u l e £ enc * about their independence of
thought. A cheerful and profane disregard
of conventions during the war-time suggested
a wildly untrammelled spirit; but, then, the
extremists” weren’t around to give orders.
Ihey didn’t go to the war. The chief reason
to doubt the Australian’s sturdy common-
sense is that he has, apparently more than
anyone else in the world, the delusion that
owing unlimited money is the sure road to
wealth and happiness.
* * * •
Actual revolution may come without blood-
shed and with little fuss, though there may
be abundant fuss later on. A good beginning
is made when the Government can rule
against the will of. the people. That appears
to have been achieved, so far its concerns
State affairs, in Queensland, where a party
with so little real support that it couldn’t
find a safe Federal seat for its leader in all
its territory has still rigged up a machine
which grinds out State majorities to order.
The next step is to dispense with the people.
That was done in fact if not in name in
Russia when Lenin and co. sent the people’s
National Convention about its business, and
then “granted” a Constitution of their own,
and made a shadow Parliament which rules
so little that it could no more depose the self-
appointed kings of November, 1917, than it
could depose Gon. If Labor—the new “Red”
Labor, well-drilled and thoroughly broken to
harness —could get control of the Australian
Federal Parliament it would presumably aim
to dig itself in permanently, and would not
propose to foolishly let go again after the
fashion of previous Labor Ministries whkji
lacked redness. The revolution could be
accomplished, and the necessary laws passed
making it illegal to object to the revolution,
almost before the typical Podsnap Aus-
tralis knew things were revolving. Of
course some favorable conditions are neces-
sary, and no one can accuse the present
generation of Premiers and Prime Ministers,
even the most Tory among them, of sparing
any effort to supply conditions —lots and
heaps and dollops of the worst conditions.
THE CASE FOR THE SPECK.
Tasmania joined up with the other States
at the time of Federation mainly on senti-
mental grounds. It was protested by those
who opposed the union that on account of
her insular position she would not receive
any benefit, but, on the contrary, would
suffer many difficulties and losses. In answer
it was pointed out that the Constitution
made provision for assistance to any needy
State, and that this provision was inserted
chiefly because of the certain disabilities that
Tasmania and Westralia would suffer under
Federation.
Westralia was then isolated, and the force-
ful John Forrest had used his influence
upon the Convention to get protection for his
State. But Westralia is in reality a small
sufferer compared ' with Tasmania. At the
inception of Federation Tasmania collected
about 30s. per head from Customs and Excise.
The Federal collections from the same source
are now about £6 per head, and under the
per capita distribution 255. per head is re-
turned out of this sum. It is true that the
Commonwealth realised that Tasmania had
suffered a loss, and agreed to make a special
grant of £900,000, extending over 10 years ;
and at the termination of the period last
year it passed a further sum of £85,000 for
one year, leaving the future in uncertainty.
This uncertainty ought to be ended as
quickly as possible.
The case for Tasmania is that she can
justly claim special consideration owing to
her isolation from the group, and that so
far Federation, by enormously advancing
Australian mainland manufactures, although
mostly at high prices, has added to rather
than induced the disabilities and handicaps
with which the island started. .She does not
grumble about the high tariff, because she
is loyal to the protectionist ideals; but she
asks other States to remember that nearly
five-sixths of her importations are from fac-
tories on the mainland. She pays the pro
tective duties without getting the fruits
of Protection. She. contributes about
£200,000 per annum towards keeping the
sugar industry in Queensland alive, and
about a million and a half is paid
to the Customs altogether to subsidise
mainland enterprises. In Victoria 9 p.c. of
the population are engaged in manufacturing
industries, in N. S. Wales 7 p.c., in Queens-
land 6 p.c., in Tasmania only 4i p.c. It
is apparent from these figures alone that the
larger or more populous States get the most
benefit from the tariff. In addition a good
portion of our importations from overseas
are distributed from the mainland, which
means extra cost to the consumer, and em-
ployment of labor outside Tasmania. The
enormous revenues collected from duties are
spent on various public enterprises and in
the payment of interest on developmental-
and war-loans. Most of the big Federal
undertakings are quite naturally in the
larger mainland States ;■ Tasmania gets but
a very small portion of the expenditure
on public works. The Federal capital, the
East-West railway, the docks, shipyards, etc..
are a few items from which Tasmania derives
no direct benefit, but must help to foot
the bill. Her exports are mainly primary
products; and in order to get them to the
markets they must be shipped. The Naviga-
tion Act applies in this State as in
the others, although we are shut out from
direct intercourse with the mainland, except
by sea. It would be easily possible to show that
in one way and another the State would be
money in pocket if she were outside the
Union. But we know that is out of the
question. We are told.that, this being so, we
should ask our people to shoulder full respon-
sibility and face financial difficulties as the
other States have done. We are prepared
to bear our full share of the burden. But
we do ask that our weakness should not be
imposed upon in ignorance of the facts.
Nor will a mere surface consideration of
statistics always serve. It is true, for
example, that Tasmania collects the lowest
State revenue per head. But this is due to


the fact that receipts from public works and
services are much lower than in the other
States, and not to lack of taxation. Our
direct taxation is higher than that of any
other State with the exception of Queens-
land, and our income-tax exemption is lower
than any other in the Commonwealth. And
our outgoings are heavy. Owing to the w T et
climate and rough country, roads and rail-
ways are more expensive to construct and
maintain. It has been found necessary to
spend about four millions of loan money on
roads in order to open up certain of the pro-
ducing centres approached only with diffi-
culty. Tasmania has spent three millions
upon the development of her water power,
one of her chief assets, and about a like
amount upon Repatriation, and so far has
not received anything of a return from the
two items. Repatriation is likely to be
almost a dead financial loss. And she gets
less revenue from railways per mile than any
other State, owing to the short runs and the
steep grades and expensive haulage. In
short, the difficulties of raising ample
revenues are due to the limited field of taxa-
tion, while the overhead charges cannot be
reduced to any extent. The present Public
Service organisation could cope wuth a con-
siderably larger volume of business, yet it
cannot be cut down to any appreciable de-
gree, and allow of efficiency.
There is a general faith that the more
serious difficulties of the small State wull
disappear within the next decade, chiefly as
a result of increasing industrial activity, en-
couraged by cheap hydro-electric power; but
during this period we want assistance and
can fairly claim consideration as a suffering
and loyal member of the Union. Tasmania
has many valuable assets: a good climate,
an adequate rainfall, great timber resources
and tine water-power possibilities. She pos-
sesses good reserves of base metals and coal,
but is in the position of a profitable indus-
try endeavoring to develop these assets on
insufficient Capital, and the danger is that
if the burden of taxation is made too heavy,
the advent of the necessary capital will be
discouraged by its diversion or transfer
to places where taxation is lighter.
We believe that assistance now will relieve
the Commonwealth presently; and we be-
lieve alto that the presence of a weak, un-
developed, little-populated island State
handy to the chief capitals of the mainland
will be a source of danger to the Common-
wealth.
J. E. O.
PLAIN ENGLISH.
The Income-tax Tangle.
Under the scheme tentatively adopted by
the Premiers the Commonwealth will collect
income-tax up to 2s. 6d. in the £ on the whole
profits of cos. and the States will bite the
individual—shareholders included—for ■ as
much as they think the idctims can stand.
At present the Commonwealth collects 2s. sd.
in the £ on the undivided profits and varying
amounts on the individual shareholders’ in-
come ; and in N. S. Wales the State Gov-
ernment takes 2s. 6d. in the £ on cos.’ divi-
dends, but does not tax the individual share-
holder. It is calculated that the Common-
wealth’s 2s. sd. in the £ of undivided profits
is equal to Is. 3d. in the £ of all profits,
divided and undivided; so the States are
also to be entitled to bite cos. for Is. 3d. in
the £ of their total profits. Thus the total
tax on cos. may be—in IN. S. Wales certainly
will be —3s. 9d. in the £; and the share-
holders individually will pay something un-
specified in addition. But there is this flaw.
The Prime Minister says that the 2s. ’sd. in
the £ of undivided profits is equal to Is. 3d.
on the total profits. But if a co. does not
divide its profits this year and pays 2s. sd.
on them, next year the individual share-
holder doesn’t pay on the same money if it
is divided then —anyway, he doesn’t pay up
to 2s. sd. in the £. So if the Commonwealth
collects 2s. 6d. and the State collects Is. 3d.,
and the individual shareholder pays the full
rate on all his dividends, he will, indirectly
and directly, be fleeced for more than he is at
present. Also, generally speaking, it is only
the big, powerful concern which doesn’t
divide most of its profits—especially the big
banks and insurance cos. Tne smaller con-
cerns, therefore, pay little to the Common-
wealth;- hence their tax isn’t anything
like the 3s. Dd. in the £ which this new
arrangement entitles Commonwealth and
State between.them to seize. To that extent
the- new arrangement is one which suits the
big, old, profitable company and is liable to
be very rough on the small, young, struggling
co. whicn hasn’t reached the point at which
it can afford to lay by half its profits: it
might be glad to, but it can’t do it and
give its shareholders a reasonable return.
There are other points that seem to have had
very little consideration: the whole ques-
tion of company taxation at a flat rate, for
instance, which means the flat-rate taxation
.of the millionaire shareholder and the poor
..shareholder whose total income may be only
a hundred or two. This aspect of the case
used to rule company taxation out ; it was
left then for the taxing authority to get at
the individual shareholder according to his
aggregate income. But that sound principle
was thrown overboard when money was
wanted in a hurry, and in N. S. Wales a
flat rate of Is. was charged. Under the pre-
text of war necessities the rate was pushed
up to Is. 6d. and then to 2s. 6d.; and the
Commonwealth, looking around for un-
harvested fields, grabbed the undivided-
profits tax —with the important proviso be-
forementioned. Now, however, Bruce accepts
the grossly-unfair flat-rate company tax as
the sole field which the Commonwealth may
enter. If he had more knowledge and experi-
ence he wouldn’t. He could not have sug-
gested many schemes which would do him
and the Commonwealth much less credit.
A New Use for Convicts.
The Victorian police have evolved a method
of getting evidence in capital cases which
promises to make the lot of the force a
relatively easy one. They hanged Colin
Ross on it, and more recently another only
missed the same fate through a jury dis-
agreement. The principal evidence for the
Crown in the latter case was supplied by a
prisoner in Melbourne Gaol —a friend, signi-
ficantly, of Harding, the convict who got
his freedom and a blood-money grant of
£2OO for his testimony against Ross. This
second man, who admits to “about eight con-
victions,” is a burglar serving an indetermi-
nate sentence. According to his story the
accused sought him out in Melbourne Gaol,
confessed to the murder of which he was
then charged, and asked him to effect the
destruction of certain incriminating evidence.
If he spoke the truth the topic of the alleged
murder was a monomania with the accused:
He had a hundred conversations with me about
the matter. He seldom spoke about anything else.
The story may all be true. The Bulletin
has nothing to say on that point. A mur-
derer is often a neurotic who must talk even
though by doing so he puts his neck in a
noose. On the other hand it may be a lie
concocted and sworn to by a clever criminal,
well aware that even a conviction for per-
jury can make matters no worse for one in
his desperate plight, and equally aware that
if his story is believed he has a chance
of being shipped abroad with a gen-
erous money gift. The temptation experi-
enced by a detective to go after such
evidence in a case where he has made up
his mind as to the guilt of the accused must
be tremendous. And in any gaol he would
knew scores of men only too eager to pro-
vide the means —for a consideration. But
not all police-officers are honest, as was
shown in the recent Criminal Appeal case of
Frank Desmond, who was convicted and
given two years on a confession which
turned out to have been “extracted from
him by threats and violence on the part of
the Glen Innes (N.S.W.) police.” So that
the newly-formed habit of the Victorian
police of going to the scum of the gaol
population when at a loss for more credible
witnesses is liable to have these undesirable
reactions, amongst others
Detectives will be disposed to take the easiest
way, and, when in doubt, play burglars or other
malefactors, who, in addition to being' devoid of
nice scruples, understand that they will decline to
assist the prosecution at their peril, and that, in
the other event, benefits will accrue to them.
One set of jurors may accept such poisoned evi-
dence and thereby be the means of sending an inno-
cent man to the gallows, while another set, dis-
gusted at the spectacle of confessedly infamous
characters appearing in the box on behalf of the
Crown, may shut their ears to the whole case for
the prosecution and let a guilty man go free.
In any case the administration of justice must be
brought into contempt, greater or less according to
the record of the criminal who appears in court to
protect the community from criminality.
These are some reasons why Victoria should
discourage the present entente between its
gaol-birds and their gaolers, and it can
hardly begin the good work too soon.
Empire Loyalty—or Disruption?
“I despise nobody so much as he who will
not speak his loyalty”—thus Weaver,
M.L.A., at a recent Sydney function. The
occasion was the delivery of an exordium by
a suburban clergyman on “Protestanism as a
factor in British Imperialism,” the text be-
ing :
The sooner a Protestant party succeeds to the
Legislature, dominated by the one great aim to
check the advance of Rome, the better it will be for
this Empire.
What has Mr. Weaver ever done to prove
his loyalty? When the war began which
threatened the Empire’s life he looked as
hefty a young fellow as there was in Aus-
tralia. This paper has no record of his
getting into khaki until 1918 —by which time
one-armed men, one-eyed men, tuberculous
men and men in the late fifties were doing
front-line work with the A.I.F. —and the war
ended before he had shed any blood in the
cause, or, indeed, left Australia. According
to official figures published by London Times,
of 1U26 Stonyhurst (R.C.) students and ex-
students between the ages of 18 and 50, 908
were serving overseas; the Oratory (a much
smaller R.C. school) had 398 serving out of
a total, between the ages of 18 and 50, of
512; and the record of the rest of the R.C.
public schools was equally good. In Australia
the It.C.’s are 20 per cent, of the population,
and they were 20 per cent, of the A.I.F.
Incidentally, they provided 22 per cent, of
the A.I.F. dead. Compare the Imperial
record of Weaver, who is never afraid to
speak his loyalty, with that of Father
Nevin (C. de G.), who lost a leg, Father
Clune (M.C.)i w*ho lost the sight of an eye,
and other padres of this church whicn,
according to the ISorth Shore M.L.A., needs
to be disciplined by politicians of his stamp
if the Empire is to be saved. The explana-
tion of Weaver apparently is that he failed
to push into the Fuller Cabinet on his
merits, and is now trying to get there as
the only man who sees through Rome’s designs
against the monarchy. The notion that a
Sydney agent is in possession of informa-
tion on world politics which has eluded
George V. and all his advisers would be
diverting were it not that the exploitation of
.such bunkum for political purposes contains
potentialities dangerous to the peace and
good government of the country, and even, in
the last resort, to the security of the Empire.
Society to-day is in a condition dangerously
receptive to hate-propaganda, however idiotic.
A few interested politicians revived the Ku
Klux Ivlan movement in the U.S.A. not so
long ago. and now, according to the New
York World’s Washington correspondent:
Whole communities are torn by such religious dis-
sension that neighbors, formerly the .best of friends,
are virtual feudists, and families are disrupted.
The spirit of religious intolerance is seizing
churches and spreading to all branches of business.
Outrages are being committed by masked night
raiders. The judiciary, school system, politics and
newspapers are so influenced or controlled by the
Klan that all former normal relationships and pro-
cesses of law and order have been completely under-
mined. .
The natural tendency of most people when a
sectarian-monger becomes active is to move
off, and leave the field to those who derive
pleasure from the spectacle of a section of
the populace being blackguarded in the name
of Empire. A similar spirit landed the
U.S.A. in its present difficulty, and unless
public opinion becomes articulate, it may
yet have a like reaction here. Local politi-
cians who talk about organising a crusade
against 20 per cent, of the population are
certainly as dangerous to Empire unity, and
hence to the national safety, as any republi-
can envoys or prelates that Ireland is likely
to send us just now.

Australia’s Defence Obligations.
A Sydney Telegraph leader contained these
remarks last week :
Australia’s best defence is not a naval base at
Singapore or anywhere else, but 30 or 40 million
people. As long as Great Britain has strength to
spare for antipodean use Australia is safe; but in
the uncertainty regarding the complications that may
at any time occur, it would be worse than folly
to count on this lasting for ever. It is unsafe to
count upon it lasting one day longer than we can
help. In the meantime, the way for us to strengthen
the Empire is to strengthen the part of it we occupy,
and so relieve British statesmen of anxiety concern-
ing the safety of this most important Dominion,
which is the last she could afford to lose. Every
new unit added to our effective population adds an
element of strength to British diplomacy, as a keeper
of the world’s peace. It makes war less likely to
come to us, and less to be feared if it should come.
This is the impudently meaningless stuff
which the British taxpayer has been hearing
with growing impatience for 20 years—the
equivalent of a fraudulent bankrupt’s promise
to pay something unspecified in the unspecified
future, provided his creditor will only go
on subsidising him. It is true, as the D.X.
notes, that Britain is anxious concerning the
safety of “this important Dominion, which is
the last she could afford to lose.” We owe
her, one way and another, perhaps
£000,000,000. At present the money is not
only unsecured and unprotected (a matter
of allowing the R.A.N. to expire) ; it is
also incapable of being protected, inasmuch
as we have no dock capable of accommo-
dating a modern capital ship. According to
present rate of progress, we shall not
show a population of 40 millions until the
census of 2011; but, in any event, population
does not constitute security. China has over
300 rfiillions, but has been the, prey of the
armed nations for many generations—the
penalty of taking the primrose path, as re-
gards defence, which the Telegraph advo-
cates for this country. When Australians
blandly talk of waiting till the Common-
wealth has a population of 30 or 40 millions
before worrying about defence, they have not
even the slender justification of the pre-war
anti-R.A.N. school. Before the war there
was a certain proud reluctance in England to
beg for help. Britain felt that in time the
Dominions would see for themselves the un-
fairness of an arrangement which left the
whole burden of Imperial defence on .1.
Bull’s weary shoulders. Pride, however,
has its limits, and in the last few years
British statesmen, such as the present First
Lord of the Admiralty, and British sailors,
such as Admiral Beatty, have been calling
on us to play the game without any reti-
cences whatever. British opinion, as expressed
of late by all its representative men who have
discussed the subject, is quite clear as to
what is expected of Australia. It is con-
sidered that we should begin to contribute
now to an Imperial defence-pool ships to
the value of five-and-a-half millions sterling,
and —equally important—the men to officer
and man them. By the time the Common-
wealth has a population six or eight times
larger, the obligation will no doubt have
proportionately increased. At present the
irreducible minimum is as stated; and we
must either accept the situation and pay up
or sit down under the charge of being a
nation of confidence-tricksters.
-■ C ——
“All Other,”
It is a sign of the tendencies of the day
and generation that in the 45-million-pound
loan scheme which the Commonwealth and
States have concocted for the new financial
year, railways and tramways stand for oniy,
nine millions, or one-fifth of the whole. They
are beaten badly by repatriation, in its vari-
ous forms, and have a fairly close race with
“Immigration,” though they beat “Other Pur-
poses” (sometimes set down as “All Other”)
handsomely. Theoretically, loans are in- ,
curred for reproductive works, of which rail-
ways and tramways were once the chief.
Then other items crept in. Now railways
almost look like creeping out and leaving
the other items in possession. The case of
N. S. Wales, the State which owes the big-
gest heap of millions, is typical. There is
hardly a visible hope of building another
yard of payable railway oustide Sydney! Lines
which come on the Treasury for part of the
interest on their borrowed capital, or for ail
the interest, or for the entire interest and
part of the working expenses, are a drug in
the market. Most of the recent achievements
of Ma belong to the third and utterly disas-
trous category—in fact, eight out of the last
nine railways do, and the ninth, though it
pays expenses, doesn’t nearly cover interest.-
Yet money must be borrowed or else the State
must find a new type of statesman who can
get along without it. In fact, more money
must be borrowed, it being now an unwritten
law that the new loans coming in shall equal
the interest going out, and leave a margin to
fly round with. The interest is always grow-
ing bigger (it doubled between 1912 and
1921), and nobody ever noticed anything
mean or skimpy about the margin. In these
circumstances this advantage attaches to a
policy of spending the loan funds on settle-
ment, immigration, public buildings, or even:
on some pyramids as an attraction for
settlers, or a temple to Diana of the
Ephesians—the most that can be lost is the
principal, with cumulative interest on it
till Judgment Day. There is no distressing
bill for running expenses in addition, for
Diana doesn’t run these times. The belated
analysis in the “Quarterly Bulletin of Aus-
tralian Statistics” gives the actual figures
for 1920-21. In that year the States ex-
pended a little over 37 millions of other
people’s money. “Land Purchased for Settle-
ment” was an easy winner with £13.300.084.
This, when it is analysed, may be taken to
mean that the State sold the land originally
and used the proceeds as revenue. Then it
bought it. back at the top. of a market in-
flated by the lavish scattering of war loans,
and doubly inflated by the news that a rich
buyer was in sight who was determined to
have land at any price. The purchase money
was also borrowed at the top of the market,
and is to a considerable extent lost, for the
buyers can’t in a multitude of cases pay the
impossible prices they are committed to.
“Railways and Tramways,” representing a
shade over eight millions, came second, and
“All Other,” representing a shade under eight
millions, was a good third. This item didn’t
include “Water Supply, etc.,”, or “Harbors,
Rivers, etc..” or “Roads and Bridges,” or
“Public Buildings,” for they all appeared
separately. It is pleasing to anticipate the
satisfaction of young Posterity when he
grows up and inherits his debts, and proceeds
to overhaul the accompanying assets, and
when he finds that these latter consist largely
of “All Other.” When he investigates further
and discovers that other large securities con-
sist of immigrants, and a mortgage by him-
self to himself on his own soil for the settle-
ment of these immigrants, his dish of joy
will doubtless overflow. In 1894 N. S.
Wales had £7O 4s. of each £lOO of its mod-
erate debt represented by railways and tram-
ways, which are at least perceptible things,
and also the things which w4re the original
justification of a steady borrowing policy,
the other £29 16s. being sundries. The figures
for other States are not at hand. In 1908,
£39 9s. 2d. out of each £lOO of debts of ail
the States was represented by matters other
than railways and tramways, and such sturdy
assets as “Development of Mines” began to
attract the eye. At June, 1921, the oddments
represented £213,111,000, or £46 9s. 6d. per
cent, of the debt. June, 1923, will see them
representing more than half, and “All Other”
flourishing exceedingly. There was quite a
recent time when people in N. S. Wales, and
to a less degree in some other States, hugged
with a bear-like grip the conviction that they
could, if so inclined, sell the railways, pay
off the public debt and start fair. That ide4
isn’t hugged now. Quite a marine-store of
mixed properties are being got together for
the rising generation, and the possibility of
selling them at even half-cost is never men-
tioned.
Money-making.
Sydney Mint, which was established in the
early ’fifties, is to be closed at the end
of this year. Until the opening of the Mel-
bourne Mint, in 1872, the Sydney institution
was one of considerable importance, and
many millions of pounds’ worth of gold
passed through it. Latterly it has
been very little more than a receiving depot
for gold from N. S. Wales and Queensland,
and its business has been very limited owing
to the decadence of the industry in those
parts. Last year it involved the State in
a loss of £7OOO, and this year is expected
to show a larger debit. The Mint in Mel-
bourne, on the other hand, is very profitable
to the Federal Treasury, because of the silver
and bronze it: handles. Last year an excep-
tionally large quantity of these tokens was
issued, and there was a net profit of
£140,459. A florin contains only a trifle
more than Is. worth of silver even on the
recent high average-value of the metal. Last
year the cost of the bullion was £167,902, and
there was a gross profit of £143,923, or
£125,506 net. Bronze currency is an even
better-paying proposition. There were issued
last year pennies and half-pennies of a cur-
rency value of £44,850; the metal used in mint-
ing these cost only £10,335, showing a gross
profit of £24,515. The net profits realised
on coinage of silver and bronze since 1917
have been: 1917, £327,344; 1918, £205,477;
1919, £110,745; 1920, £53,086; 1921,
£74,722; 1922, £140,458. As to the profits
on gold coinage, strict secrecy is preserved.
In the early stages of the war all gold was
commandeered by the Government. The re-
sults after the removal of the embargo on
the export of gold and upon the formation
of the Gold Producers’ Association in 1919
indicate that prior to that time the Imperial
and Federal Governments reaped, or had a
chance to reap, a big harvest. Or if not
the Governments, then the Commonwealth
Bank. For the 47 months ended Dec. last
the G.P.A. handled £14.511,363 worth of
gold (standard value), and received premiums
of £3,509,340. What happened to the pre-
mium in the war-days before the Association
was formed?
Gaol and the Moron.
“R. G. N. Cliff well,” after a close study
of the problem:—
Parents, school-teachers and organised qwomen-
kind, in Victoria especially, are seriously disturbed
by the prevalence Of that form of degeneracy which
finds expression in the abduction and molestation
of very young girl-children. Women’s organisations
have made representations to the State Government
upon the subject. The demand that something be
done may be said to be general. Docjtrijnaire
observers advocate emasculation; but public opinion
will not uphold anything so drastic. Others say
segregate, lock up for life. Any intention to
follow the latter course, however, is met by a new
problem as regards treatment of the sexual degene-
rate, though an old one to the penologist. For the
moron of this type gaol as at present conducted is
the worst possible remedy.
When Victoria ceases to pretend, and faces its
gaol problem frankly, it will learn that the biggest
drag on reformation by locking-up is the practice
of self-abuse. In all its phases the System lends
itself to the degrading vice. Single-cell confinement,
forbiddance of : social intercourse between prisoners,
wholly masculine surroundings, insufficient toil by
which to send the toiler to bed healthily tired, the
ennui of long lonely hours in which the man has
nothing to do but think or be i bestial, the fact
that nineteen-twentieths of those in gaol are of low
human type indisposed or unable to think or read,
the total lack of enjoyment (in the sense understood
by inferior mentalities) —they all (throw the prisoner
back upon himself. Even modern amenities like
sewering—a pan and flusher to every cell —add to the
difficulties. Of what use to thrust a sex-maniac
into an environment like this ancj to expect reform?
Unthinking people are laughing superciliously at
the gaol brass band, the community singing, the
periodical concerts by visiting theatricals, the
extension of factory departments, the bright paint,
the rebuilding of dark cells, the introduction of
moral and material light, permission of cell-adorn-
ment, the profuse bath and shower facilities with
which prison reform is being attempted. Yet they
represent valuable munitions in the fight against that
(Which makes the locking-up of mep a mere thrusting
of them downward towards the beasts. Further to
meet the problem, Victoria is considering some
revision of its system in the direction of placing
three and four men in a cell instead of one. It is
considering, too, extension of opportunities for
gaol work —real work, engrossing to the mind,
repercussing on the body in the form of healthy
fatigue—adequate payment for work well done, and
amendment of the penal code which will permit
infliction upon low-grade offenders of sentences of
such length that the reformative qualities of hard
work, hygienic surroundings, reasonable amenities and
carefully chosen social intercourse will have time
to act. Gaol will be the means of showing this
type of man a stratum of life marked by a standard
of comfort and decency he has had no chance to
experience in his free state —in the hope that upon
release he will be eager not to return to his old
squalid, ambitionless existence. Moreover, if the
reform is carried to completion, he will emerge
equipped with a several-years’ apprenticeship to one
of. a selected group of skilled trades; he will have
money in his pocket, and should go out to a home
kept in comfort during his absence and made ready
for his return out of the regular, payments he has

Ft „ ts&oltl v, a Half-weekly Tenancy.
“SE. • iONisy” : I remain quite cold’after
reading the passionate protestations of in-
terested but unconvincing parties that what
northern N.S.W. requires is not a new State
with control of its own land revenue, land
policy, immigration policy, railways, rail-
way-building, ports, harbors, loans, roads,
rabbits and destiny, but county councils—big-
municipalities piled on top of the smaller
municipalities, but with the system un-
changed. If one has urgent need for an
artesian bore it is no good offering him a
lighthouse. The whole thing works out like
this:—•
Under a clew State Government the area would
have six vSe""»-irs of its own to look after its inter-
ests. The county council compromise would leave
it as it is—with an uncertain or one-fifth share in
the Big State’s six, who may all come from the
capital.
When the loan-money assets were valued and
divided the people of the New State would probably
owe about £5O per head, and be the least indebted
section of the Commonwealth. The county council
idea would leave them owing £B7 per head, as at
present.
? The place, as a New State, would have a hand-
some land revenue to meet its liabilities, and, if it
was a sane sort of spot, to build public works with.
Under county councils it would have no land
revenue (as at present), though it would supply a
lot (as at present).
The No’-r.h, in the capacity of a New State, might
have at any moment, if it pleased, two or three
ris’iig sexperts, direct railways to the sea, and, in
manv cases, only half the distances; and the short
line co Brisbane, which has been a will-o’-the-wisp
for t\.o decades. Even if the district was snowed
under with county councils the present order o'c
things would remain in all these respects.
A New State Government, in the north of N.S.W.
or anywhere else, would have permanently, and in
its own right, all the powers which the Federal
Constitution leaves to the States. A terrace of
county councils would have such powers as its old
jealous State boss pleased, for as long as he pleased,
and till he chose to withdraw them, as he did the
very short-lived powers of the only N.S.W. harbor
authority that was ever permitted to exist outside
Sydney. The difference between the two schemes
is just the difference between owning a freehold and
being a weekly or half-hourly tenant.
The present arrangement of circumstances
is so comforting and convenient for the old
crowd of tribute-collectors that naturally
they explain that everything which can pos-
sibly be wanted in the way of decentralisa-
tion is obtainable without the old centralisa-
tion being interfered with. As one of them
recently put it in The Bulletin, the bless-
ing of freedom, in the shape of the county
council, lies at our feet like a squashed toad
with a priceless jewel in its hair, waiting to
be shovelled up and poured into a jug for
future use —or words to that effect. Despite
all eloquence of this sort the secessionists
stick to their point. Their misfortune is
that they are very slow in finding the sort of
leader who can carry a point.

Charity on the Cheap.
The reflections of “Whitehall”:—
A favorite, if not the favorite, argument against
State-run hosoitf Is is that a moral hurt will be done
to the eomßiU'nty if it is debarred from exercising
its charitable '.npulses in the interests of the indigent
sick. There was something in the contention before
the war. . number of worthy folks worked unobtru-
sively for charity, their names unknown to the general
public, their only reward the knowledge that they
were doing good. With the war new people emerged
who possessed large fortunes and a corresponding Just
for self-advertisement. They realised quickly that the
easiest way to acquire reclame was to break into
“Society.” But how to do it? Sweet charity sup-
plied the answer. The hospitals were amongst the
institutions which had been hardest hit by the war.
Their patients had increased while their revenues had
decreased. The advantage of toiling for a hospital,
from the standpoint of a social climber, is that the
present position is so desperate that the humblest
aspirant with money or the capacity to raise it
from someone else has to be welcomed. If the
“drive” is an affair of any magnitude, there are
meetings at Government House, or at the homes of
others whom the committee women-climbers would
not otherwise consort with on friendly terms. After
half-a-dozen of these gatherings it is a poor moun-
taineer who has failed to form the nucleus of asocial
circle drawn from the set into which she has decided
to penetrate.
Her ambitions are furthered by another post-war
phenomenon. Previous to the end of 1914 Austra-
lians were a staid people who danced, theatred, etc.,
in moderation. In commercial cities such as Mel-
bourne and Sydney the rich indulged in a few club
and charity balls at fixed periods of festivity, while
very oecasionaly a big dance was given by a private
hostess. The fighting ended, and Australia went danc-
ing mad. The ballroom is no longer a place merely
for young people, and especially y'-vsig unmarried
people: it is equally the stamping- o’ ayifiwag-ground
of the old and the very old. The®* <i tuore money
available for amusement than there was before the
war —much more. But, then, the prices of service,
food, champagne, whisky and all else that appertains
to entertainment have doubled where they have not
trebled. The clubs can no longer stand the
racket, and most of the private hostesses of other
days have long given up the struggle. And so charity
has come into its own. At a guinea a head a iamUv
can get a night’s jazzing at any time practically tnu
whole year round, and simultaneously have the satis-
faction of feeling that a hospital is being assisted.
For bo guineas or less it can entertain its intimate
friends, instead of having to spend hundreds of pounds
on a private dance to which all sorts of casual
acquaintances and known enemies have to be invited
for one reason and another, as was the way under Ibe
old system. And practically all these charity revels
are “Government House affairs.” Our vice-regal fam-
ilies have also accommodated their habits to the
times. Government House balls are almost things of
the past: the average Governor does his bit socially in
the form of a small dinner now and then ; or, still
better, a luncheon at which the guests are set an
admirable example in frugality. Instead of enter-
THE MEDDLERS.
“A convention will be called shortly by politi cians to consider the holding of a referendum of
the people with a view to amending the Constitution.”
THE POLITICAL TOMMY TINKERS: “Hi, mister, lend us your axe, will you?—we want to
see the works go round!”
tain Pig, the viee-regalities are entertained —-at charity
balls, theatrical shows, etc., for which they are not
expected to buy tickets.
If this ingenious device for combining the business
of pleasure-on-the-cheap with the virtue of beneficence
were effective in the way of maintaining the hospitals,
there would be nothing to say against it. Unfortu-
nately from the hospital standpoint is is a confessed
failure. The bigger “Society” grows (and no woman
whose husband is prepared to provide her with a regu-
lar allowance of charity tickets and jazz-frocks need
be cut of it nowadays), the more balls and amateur
theatrical entertainments there are, and the more red
carpets and dais rugs our vice-regal toilers wear out,
the more patients the great hospitals have to turn
away for lack of beds. If the gaols and asylums were
maintained on such preposterous lines, neither the
properties nor the lives of the jazzers would be safe.
As things are it is only the lives of the poor that are
endangered; but as these are the charge of the Gov-
ernment equally with the lives of the rich, it is time
the State assumed an obligation it has too long
neglected, and took the support of the hospitals
entirely out of the hands of Private Enterprise.
“Rio”: The Minister fer Tefence has again
appealed for more students to enter D ,<n-
troon, but although the entrance examination
has been abolished eniran 3 arp rvf fart'-
coming. Had the Minister taken*, ’■jot® cf
the passenger-list of a liner which left Aus-
tralia about the day he made his appeal he
would have seen the names of two officers
whose reasons for leaving the land of their
birth would have thrown some light on the
difficulty of filling the college. One, a colonel
retired last year, left for Europe, where there
are more opportunities for retired regular-
officers. The other is one of the few survivors
of the first batch of Duntrooners. Deco-
rated and “mentioned” five times, he returned
the senior R.M.C. graduate of the A.1.F., and
also did a brilliant course at the Staff Col-
lege. Surely an officer with this record
should be able to look ahead to something-
more than a hand-to-mouth existence; but,
although his prospects were as goo i as those
of any officer of his age in the service, he
found that his pay would not allow him any
of the comforts that a brainy and successful
young man in any other profession looks for-
ward to. He, therefore, resigned, and has
left to take up a lucrative civil appointment
in England, one of several offered him by
men he met during the war. Incidentally,
with the few cadets now at the college, it
is practically impossible to teach drill and
tactics properly, and it would pay any young
Australian with military inclinations to go
to Sandhurst or Woolwich. The cost would
be about £5OO, and the pay and prospects
on graduation are so superior to those of
the Duntrooner that the £5OO could be re-
couped out of the first few years’ income.
Not only is the pay twice as great as the
Australian, but promotion is much quicker,
and the hard-working officer is soon noticed
and selected for preferment. If Australia
wants good and well-trained staff-officers, -it
must bring their pay and prospects up to
something approaching those of the British
Army.
Dear Bulletin, —It is pleasing to note that
even if Australia has to part with Hickson
there will be no absolute void. Several of
the local clergy have started to practise “the
laying on of hands.” A Chinese missioner
has advertised that he was in the line long
before Hickson came, and is still in work.
And it is published that two Chicago (L.S.)
“evangelists.” Dr. Bedderwolf and Mr.
Dodeiieaver, are on their way here. They
represent the family Altar League, and will
probably perform miracles if sufficient in-
ducement offers. Australia has had miracle-
mongers not a few, including a gentleman
belonging to a judicial family who breathed
on the iufferers through red flannel, and an
Italian uersonage with a tossing mane who
had been celebrated when in the glove trade
for his taking way with women. There was
a sort of rdm religious light about this Dago
healer, and, when he was in trade, flappers
of gentle birth fell at his feet while they
held up their delicate paws to be fitted. It
rather suggested Bret Harte’s maiden and
the Ritualist parson :
He wore, I a chasuble that day when first
we met,
A cope and snowy alb likewise, I recollect them
yet.
He called me “daughter” as he raised his jewelled
hand to bless,
Anl then in thrilling undertones he asked would I
confess?
O mother dear, blame not your child if then on
bended knees
She fell and thought of Abelard and also Heloise....
A rugged Yorksh :,, e layer-on of hands did a
one-night stand in Sydney quite recently, but
made little sti r Tile supreme difficulty seems
to be to persuade chy healed to stay healed.
The former me healed, or partially healed,
or think they are healed, or their relatives
carry the child away assuming it is a lot
better, all "his being done in public and in
drover- Yhtv go home and there they can
rbVJpsp in private, and one by one, like
son’s sins. Therefore, I think being
miraculously healed should be made a notifi-
able disease, the same as death or bilharzi-
asis, so that there would be an official regis-
ter of eases. And I would have them all
officially visited, say a month after the event,
and perhaps subsequently—anyhow, before
the practitioner left, so that he eould be
given a Government certificate. I wouldn’t
put either doctors or parsons on the job, they
being liable to different kinds of prejudice.
Lawyers would do—not K.C.’s, they being
too costly. Incidentally, it is characteristic
of the slovenly ways of almost everybody
that, though the sovereigns of England had
the alleged divine power to cure scrofula
(king’s evil) by laying on hands, and did it
from the days of Edward the Confessor to
those of Anne, no definite record of a per-
manent cure is preserved. The disease didn’t
die out either, for after 600 years of steady
curing Charles 11. found 92,107 patients
waiting for him. —Yours, etc., J.E.
The judgment of the M.L. Full Court dis-
missing the appeal of Astle v. the King
comes as a jolt to holders of wholesale
licenses who advertise their wares. The
appellant is the manager of the Greytown
department of the " Wairarapa Farmers’ Co-
operative Assoc., Ltd., and advertised in the
Wairarapa Daily Times, which circulates
in Masterton, a no-license district, the offer
of Christmas hampers containing ale or
stout and other drinkables. The local police
hopped in with a summons, and the local
magistrate convicted and imposed a fine. In
view of the importance of the question, the
appeal was heard before five Judges, three
of whom decided that the Act had been in-
fringed, as the advt. amounted to the “soli-
citing of an order” in a no-license district.
Justice Salmond dissented: he thought that
the advt. was published for the purpose of
promoting business in Greytown, which is
wet, and the fact that the paper circulated
also in Masterton did not entitle the Court
to infer an unlawful purpose. Justice Reed
also thought that the magistrate should not
have determined that there was a wrongful
intention. The minority was right. The
Bulletin can certainly be found in Master-
ton. Is the Australian brewer, who adver-
tises in The Bulletin, to be accused of
having his eye on Masterton? Is the man
who advertises Judges’ wigs to be assumed to
be trying to »ell those goods to chimney-
sweeps because chimney-sweeps read the
paper in which he advertises?

“G. Rich” : I travelled with them from
Perth, on a slow train going south. Both
were Cockney factory-hands, induced tq
migrate by the usual glowing stories. They
landed in W.A. four months ago with no
money—except a few odd shillings. They
were strangers to farm work, and had no
desire to get acquainted with it. They had
spent the four months on a constant job—
tramping the streets of Perth while waiting
to be found employment by the Government.
They had received 15s. a week each, suste-
nance money. Now they were travelling to
a southern group settlement where they’d
receive 60s. a week with the chance of draw-
ing a group farm-block. They didn’t want
a farm and hoped chance wouldn’t favor
them. In six or eight months, they calcu-
lated, they’d have sufficient to enable them
to ship back to London—and factory-work.
Something seems wrong somewhere.

MEMO. FOR THE UNDER-SECRETARY FOR MINES,
BRISBANE,
In reply to your Memo., dated 16th August, requesting
information regarding the efficiency of the “Curvilinear” Vanner,
I have the honor to state that the machine is doing excellent
work. We have handled ore containing as much as 15% of
valuable sulphides, the loss in the tailings did not exceed |%
mineral; it adapts itself equally well to the low-grade ores, of which
we are treating large quantities.
The costs of repairs are very light, and the power required
equally so.

POLITICAL
POINTS
Acting-Premier Oakes (N.S.W.) was
absent when the final touches were put to
the tentative taxation agreement at the
Premiers’ Conference, and Cocks hesi-
tated to conclude the bargain. See-
ing nothing better ahead than Bruce’s pro-
position that the States should levy income-
tax on individuals and the Commonwealth on
cos., the States came into line and agreed
to give up per capita payments and surrender
interest on ' transferred properties for five
years. The maximum rake-off from cos. by
the Commonwealth was fixed at half-a-crown
in the £, but it was stipulated that the States
might, if necessary, exact up to another Is.
3d. from the same companies. Cocks pulled
this way and that way to get an adjourn-
ment of the debate, and a titled delegate
from another State interjected that it was
no wonder there were so many all-night sit-
tings in Sydney if there were many more
members as argumentative as he. But appa-
rently Cocks was the only man present who
knew what the effects were likely to be-
lie runs a little co. of his own. Finally
came an adjournment of the conference till
June 9 for the checking and revising of
details.
As far as it has gone the war has cost
Australia £525,000,000. About £375,000,000
of tli s is still owing; and a bill for about
£25,000,000 falls in every year—some of it, of
'course! 'for interest. Stay-at-home Australia
put up a really shocking performance during
the war: to March, 1918, it had spent
£185,000,000, and had raised by taxes only
£24,600,000 of it. including what it had to
pay for interest on loans. And meantime it
was loafing hard on Britain for nxaintenancc
of troops, etc., the bill for which is still
outstanding. The £525,000,000 includes the
war-gratuity bi'ibe, on account of which this
long-suffering country still owes over 20
millions.
Britain has decided not to come into the
German reparations wrangle yet. Presum-
ably its Government believes that neither
France nor Germany is in a proper condition
to judicially consider the case. It is mostly
a matter of national psychology. The “sport-
ing” Briton, when lie has had his fight, for-
gets about it; if he doesn’t forget he is more
likely to give his /late opponent a friendly
hand than anything else. Germany simply
can’t understand this “sporting” spirit. So
far as it is concerned, the war isn’t over.
Germany is still fighting. And France quite
understands. So she is fighting too.
At the Premiers’ Conference Federal Works
Minister Stewart, in reply to S.A. Premier
Bar well, said that the Constitution permits
the Commonwealth to enter the territory oi
any: State in spite of opposition and lay a
railway for purely defence purposes. Pos-
sibly but when built, could that line be
used for other than “purely defence pur-
poses”? This rattling of the Defence sabre
in the interests of something that isn’t de-
fence at all will have to be watched. Beal
defence "is not a matter of S.A. policy, nor
the enrichment of Sid Kidman; it is an
Australian actional right. And the only
real defence for Perth or Hay, Sydney or
tire Rest Home in Spring-street lies in the
immediate connection and development of
the Northern Territory.
The Premiers’ Conference fixed up a new
list of political deadheads for the Federal
and State railways ; anyone, who can wangle
a Minister’s job or the chair of any one of
Australia’s 13 Houses and stick to it for a
few inonths can travel the rest of
his days free. Deadheading costs the N.S.W.
railways alone just on £lOO,OOO a year—at
least,: that is the amount which the Com-
missioners are paid out of taxes for the ser-
vice—and the system is all wrong. There
should be none of these backstairs allow-
ances. If a Minister must have a pass fox-
life over all Australian railways, then the
money should be paid to him, and the public
would know what he costs. At present it
is told only half the truth, and not always
that much.
From a table in Sydney Trades Hall: —
The Bulletin’s remark apropos of the Dooley-
McGirr rumpus, that “there is no more fight in
McGirr than there is in a frilled lizard,” was in
many minds when the annual A.L.P. hullabaloo
started on Saturday. For the place in which the
senior -member for Sydney should have been found
contending with his numerous enemies was empty
of that voluble humbug. According to custom he
had retreated to one of his funkholes, leaving all
the fighting to be done by his ragged and dispirited
regiment. By contrast, Dooley, when he made his
appearance on Monday, was quite an impressive
figure—-cool, imperturbable, confident. Thus far the
conference has been distinguished by a riot of accu-
sations and counter-accusations touching “cronk” pre-
selections, ballot-boxes with sliding panels, and simi-
lar agreeable features of Sydney Labor politics. In
the few divisions that have been taken, the Dooley -
ites have prevailed. But should they win out, as
seems highly probable at the moment, they will owe
their victory to .help received at the crisis from
the Communist group—Howie, Garden, Willis, Den-
ford and co. They will have to pay a heavy price
for such an alliance. In a word, they may be un-
done by their auxiliaries.
From Sydney Telegixapii :
Japan to-day is in very much the same position
in which Germany stood in 1914. She has been
taxed up to the limit of her capacity for many years,
for the purpose of building up an efficient army and
navy, which have scarcely been used. The people
who have paid for these luxuries are demanding
that they get some value for their money.
A time comes when a monarch of bloated
and unused armaments must either send
them out to conquer and pay a dividend, or
start to dismantle them and save the money.
In the latter case, if it is a crowded nation
IF NATIONAL FINANCE CAME HOME.
“The Commonwealth and the States have drawn up a programme that will entail loans of
£45,000,000 per annum during the next few years. And the public is expected to give three cheers for
the ‘vigorous policy.'”
MRS. AUSTRALIAN : “Oh, darling, I’ve got such wonderful news for you that I
haven't been able to think about your dinner. Look, I've made a list of thou-
sands and thousands of pounds I can spend. WON'T we be well off when we owe
all that money!"
seeking expansion, the result may be that
the king goes into eclipse and the com-
mander-in-chief takes charge. So the Kaiser
of Japan may let loose on a much-damaged
world almost the only undamaged armament
of note that the world contains, and do so
in self-preservation. The Telegraph stated
this, and also that we seem to be in the
line of fire. Therefore it is pertinent to
inquire how much that organ has done to
urge that our North be garrisoned, or even
taken possession of, by the only visible
means —the founding of States and conse-
quently cities (State capitals) there, and
the construction of the long-overdue railway
to cai’ry the necessary people (including
troops) ? Or if it has done nothing, what
does it propose to do now that it realises
the position?
A Government led by business men who
also show some disposition to get away fi’om
cant and humbug might well consider the
relations of the Federal authority 'and
Tatt.’s. The Bulletin holds no brief for
Tatt.’s, and thinks it might well be replaced
by something which would do the public
revenues more good and have no connection
with the racing madness; but it can only see
hypocrisy and wastefulness in a Government
which declines to carry letters for Tatt.’s
and yet takes a cut of the prize-money. The
present system simply means that a thou-
sand agents—many of them the worst sort
of parasites—are employed to canvass and
collect the money for tickets; and probably
fewer tickets would be sold if the post-
office were open to receive letters for Tatt.’s,
and the agents’ occupation was thus cut
away. The revenues w'ould gain, and no-
body would lose—except, perhaps, the para-
sites before mentioned.
The wise words of Mines Minister Jones,
of Queensland :—-
It was a fallacy and a mistaken policy to merely
aspire to be a producing country. We should be a
manufacturing country, and if we manufacture and
buy our own articles we will help ourselves.
It is fairly self-evident. If we imported or
otherwise acquired 300,000 capable factory-
workers in addition to those we possess
already, we would have so many more local
customers that we would save a great deal of
the freight and loss on meat that is sniffed
at on arrival in Europe, and the cost and
freight on return goods. Also, the new tax-
payers would come in handy. But wise
words don’t carry us far. Next day Jones’s
boss, Theodore, was orating, as usual, about
settlinn; people with loan money on 3,000,000
acres in one place, and on 180,000 acres in
another, and on the whole Dawson Valley
to boot, and building more loan-money works
that will reach out to the welkin.
“Gallery”; When in Melbourne Theodore
caused it to be announced that he wouldn’t
dream of abandoning Queensland for the
Federal arena until his recently-elected Par
Lament has finished its term. This notwith-
standing, Labor men among whom he moved
When not engaged with Bruce, Oakes, Bar-
well and the rest were left with the impres-
sion that if the southern organisations set
up a unanimous howl for his services he will
yield to it. But it would not be so easy to
find him a seat as some people think.
From north of twenty-six:—
In southern reports of the Queensland elections,
Murilla was credited to the Labor party. Actually, a
belated return, counted after the “great” dailies
had dropped the painful subject, put Morgan, the
Cocky member, nearly 500 ahead. Theodore failed
to gain a seat from the Country party. Unavail-
ing was his great idea of informing every farmer in
the State, per mimeographed letter, that the industry
had been organised on a co-operative basis at the
Government’s expense and that further favors were
in store provided the farmers were properly grate-
ful at the ballot-box. This is the pitted speck in
his plucked apple.
The attention of the Bruce-Page Ministry
was being invited to the pensions of soldiers’
widows when the Prime Minister got his
well-clothed back up over a resolution passed
by the Soldiers’ Federal Executive, and
ceased to be on speaking terms. The widow
of the 65.-per-day private is the most numer-
ous, and the least likely to have affluent
relatives. She receives 235. Od. per week,
which doesn’t go far at present, lhe iacij
is getting older, and less tit to toil, and pro-
bably more rheumatic and more in ne ®d
medical attendance. The winter is cold ana
work is scarce. Therefore it was proposed
that free medical attendance for the lone
Mrs. Digger would not be amiss. It is Quite
true that this country has done a good deal
for the Digger and his missus. But mucn
of it was really done, not for the Digger,
but for the politician. The scandalous gra-
tuity was wasted to buy votes and popu-
larity. What was spent on that and a great
deal more can’t be debited to the Digger.
For the worst sufferers —the disabled men
and the dead and disabled men’s dependants
—we haven’t done so much, after all.
Finance is worrying the New Staters.
Hitherto they have depended on the shilling
membership-fee to provide campaign funds,
and the headway the movement has been
able to make on this pittance is a good indi-
cation of the general feeling in northern N.
S. Wales. The leaders, however, believe that
little will be achieved until there is a sub-
stantial fighting fund, and are now trying to
induce the leagues to go after £25,000.
The suggestion that “Paddy” J. IMinahan
should be the leader of the “militant”
Laborites in N. S. Wales shows how badly off
that section is. Of course it is not a new
suggestion. Minahan has money, and natur-
ally some friends; and on and oft during the
last 10 years, when a job in the front row
has become vacant, it has always been ten-
tatively suggested that “Paddy” was just
the man to fill it. The amusement of the
rank and file in the days when Labor stood
for the worker always caused the suggestion
to be quietly dropped. Now, taken more seri-
ously, it crops up again ; and Minahan might
do just as well as any of the others wno are
on offer.
Just because we haven’t a few millions
more to eat our beef —we employ them
instead in foreign manufacturing countries
and let the foreigners feed them —a grazier
in the Wlnton district (Q.) has just sold
500 bullocks to the Alligator Meat Works,
Townsville, for £3OO the lot. The balance
of his herd, 500 mixed sorts, brought per
head the price of a front-terrace seat at a
Stadium fight—7s. The Northern Meat
Works recently secured another grazier’s
1300 cows at 375. 6d. a head.
Dear Bulletin, —The man who wrote
that glowing article about the agricultural
resurrection of Denmark in a recent Bul-
letin might have added a postscript with-
out damage. People have a habit of consider-
ing Denmark as living wholly on agricul-
ture, but it doesn’t. No country worth living
in does. When the tiny land (it is much
smaller than Tasmania and has three million
people to the Commonwealth’s five millions)
took a manufacturing census in 1914, it had
346,000 employees in its factories (the Com-
monwealth then had 332,000), and 229,000
of them were skilled artisans. I wonder if
there was that number of really skilled arti-
sans in Australia. —Yours, C. Snook.
“Collonna”: If, as “Derry” says (B.
24/5/’23), there is variance between the
Nationalists of N. S. Wales and Queensland
over the arrest of the Irish envoys in Syd-
ney, let me assist towards a settlement. The
Irish Republican committee in Brisbane
approached the Labor executives to secure
their co-operation in a demonstration on the
visit of the delegates to Queensland. This
was promised, conditional on the assurance
that they would not be brought to Brisbane
until after the elections. The stipulation
was readily agreed to, and the necessary
arrangements made with Sydney. So the
N.S.W. Nationalists didn’t keep them back ;
and if the Queensland Nationalists think
they did they can get the idea cut of their
minds.
Sydney is expected to live in a state of
periodical and increasing water shortage till
the great Warragamba dam is built, and it
may be reduced to the primitive bush habit
of having a tin tank at the corner of the
house, to catch water and dead things off the
roof. The view from a place like Woollahra
heights, the serried tanks of Bondi spreading
like a panorama at the spectator’s feet, would
be an inspiration for a painter. The Warra-
gamba scheme is to rope in Sydney’s drink-
ing supply from Lithgow on one side and
Goulburn on the other, so these places had
better not grow too much, else they may
find themselves out in the cold for fluid.
When all the people come to the Big City,
and all the water is brought there to supply
them, a novel situation will arise.
Ramsay Macdonald and Sidney Webb have
both, like Jock Garden, been to Russia and
had a close look at Bolshevism; and what
they think of it is shown by the prominent
part they are taking in a new International
formed at a conference in Hamburg which
has the adherence of the socialist organisa-
tions of all countries except Russia. The
new International forswears Bolshevism, and

DEMOCRACY.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
The angry flock is bleating o'er the plain,
Running in woolly circles on the grass.
It does not heed the little winds that pass,
Nor sing for greenness and the gift of rain.
Always it seeks its safety in the vain
Attempt to narrow-in the running mass
Of fellow sheep. “One consciousness one class”
Is the ideal of its wool-bound brain.
Vaguely it dreams, while running on small feet,
Half suffocated in the sun and dust,
Of triumph when some chance dispels the fog
Of its unreasoning fear, and cools the heat
Caused by the mob in which it puts its trust —
Then it will turn in pride and bite the dog!

This life proprietary, which also undertakes
tire, marine and accident underwriting, has
been quoted more than any other office in the
recent flotation boom. The Bulletin has
repeatedly emphasised that the A.P.A.’s big
figures—described as “startling” by one pro-
moter —have been only one feature of its
career; of more importance was the cost of
registering those figures, and the manner in
which some of them were arrived at. There
was not the slightest doubt that policy-
getting had been too costly,. but two years
ago it seemed that founder Selby Wood had
realised the advisability of keeping a tight
rein on expenditure, and there appeared to
be prospects of a turning-point in the
A.P.A.’s expensive career. The management
having decided to look into underwriting
possibilities in London, Mr. Wood paid a
visit there, but quickly decided that prevail-
ing conditions did not justify a participation
in the gamble. It was well for the A.P.A.
that he so decided, considering subsequent
happenings in that field! For two years
following his return Mr. Wood suffered the
penalties of the strain of his strenuous pio-
neering, and only recently returned to his old
job.
Twelve months ago The Bulletin re-
marked that the co.’s future depended on the
reduction of expenses in the Life depart-
ment—there had been no improvement on
the previous year—and on its luck in tire,
marine and accident insurances. And here
is the pitiful tale of the past year’s opera-
tions :
Income. Claims. Expenses. Surplus.
Life .. £313,633 £32,549 £166,313 £114,771
General . . 75,633 41,563 64,779 30,709*
£389,266 £74,112 £231,092 £84,062
* Excess outgoings.
More than half the total Life income went
in expenses, a cost rate far in excess of what
it should be in an eleventh year. It was, of
course, affected by the volume of new busi-
ness : first-premiums amounted to slightly
more than one-third of renewals, tiie £66,560
coming from £1,600,000-odd of new assur-
ances. Assuming that old business cost 8
p.c. of renewal premiums—which is a point
more than the “Wild Cat” usually allows for
well-established offices —the new-business cost
was 227 p.c. That is a dangerously high
cost: it means that not until well on in the
third year can premiums begin to provide the
nucleus of the reservations required to meet
the contractual liability. Possibly new busi-
ness is not so costly ; if so, renewal business
takes more than 8 p.c., and administration
charges generally have been top-heavy.
Adopting another English method of calcu-
lating costs —allowing that new business
costs 10 times more than old business —the
A.P.A.’s renewal rate last year was 19.5
p.c. and first-premiums cost 195 p.c.
Meanwhile general insurance operations
luiVe gone from bad to worse Here are fig-
ures.for the past two years:—

Unexplained adjustment. .. 490 6,916
1922 . . 75,633 41,563 64,779 30,709 37,625
Expenses absorbed 85.6 p.c. of income ; claims
55 p.c. Outgoings have so far exceeded in-
come by £37,625. After a 40 p.c. provision
had been made for unexpired risks, the
total deficiency was £67,878. These figures
should be a warning to new-comers who are
creating costly organisations in the belief
that anybody who hangs out a shingle can
make profits from underwriting. The A.P.A.
would have been better-off had it not touched
the business. At December 31 the position
had become desperate; there can be only one
end to the venture unless the costly adminis-
tration can win considerable additional busi-
ness at a low expense rate, or costs of hand-
ling the present volume of business are dras-
tically revised. In either case, the manage-
ment has a long, stern chase to overtake the
deficiency.
One way and another the A.P.A. slipped
badly in its eleventh year. But the figures
so far reviewed are only those of the revenue
accounts. The latest balance-sheet records
an earthquake which shakes faith in the
published accounts of other years and shat-
ters justification for the distributions which
have been made to shareholders and to
policy-holders. An entirely new lot of direc-
tors are in control, and they instructed the
management to prepare accounts “on the most
conservative lines.” For a start they decided
that only premiums within the days of grace
should be taken credit for, instead, as pre-
viously, those outstanding up to 12 months.
This re-arrangement is, possibly, too drastic
in some instances in which the policy has
not been in force long enough to pro-
vide a surrender value to keep the policy
alive. It is certainly a more conservative
method than is employed by some big
offices, which take credit for four months’
outstanding premiums. At December 1921,
the A.P.A.’s “outstanding premiums” totalled
£(50,778; in the latest balance-sheet, £15,458.
The directors also decided to spread the pre-
miums from war-gratuity policies, previously
taken credit for in a lump, over the years
which they covered. Whether exes, attach-
ing thereto were similarly treated is not
disclosed. These were not the only corners
in which the new directors got a broom into
action. They decided to go back to 1919 to
effect a thorough clean-up, and adjustments
have been made throughout, though how the
co.’s auditors could be got to agree to such
a proceeding is a matter which surely calls
for explanation. An explanation is also due
respecting the certificate attached to the
1921 accounts, which claimed that the audi-
tors had, on April 24, certified that the pub-
lished balance-sheet had been “drawn up so
as to exhibit a true and correct view of the
Association’s affairs as shown by the
books.” Twelve months ago among
assets were debtors (unspecified) for
£85,158; in the latest accounts that collec-
tion is down to £21,337. The 1921 accounts,
it seems, credited capital and reserves with
new-share subscriptions and premiums there-
on not actually paid, and included debits on
the other side. Some of the undertakings
were not fulfilled; hence a reduction in paid
Capital from £341,747 to £328,366 and a re-
adjustment of reserves. In addition 192 l
debtors included outstanding premiums
backed by p.n.’s which also proved not
worth the paper they were written on.
The adjustments necessitated by the actu-
ary going back on his tracks to amend esti-
mates which had been based on bad debts,
and those required to counteract credits fox-
share premiums which were not received,
and the x-e-arrangement of war-gratuity
premiums, probably did not account for
all the “reserves” which disappeared.
It is practically certain that some tens
of _ thousands of reserves were also re-
quired to increase funds to the actu-
ary’s requirements, notwithstanding that the
latest balance-sheet mentions a “transfer to
reserve, after providing for actuarial lia-
bility,” of £4413. Taking the high costs into
consideration, The Bulletin refuses to
accept the suggestion, made by the published
accounts, that the A.P.A. has been able to
fulfil the actuary’s requirements wholly from
income.
The net result of the adjustments has been
that, after transferring the 1921 loss on
general insurance to an establishment
account, life funds and general reserves were
written down by no less than £158,856. The
effect on the balance-sheets has been as
follows :
1921. 1922.
Life Fund £410,327 £463,499
Reserve Fund .. .. 114,642 52,466
Fire, etc., Reserves.. .. 27,665 30,253
Total .. . . £552,634 £546,213
Establishment accounts . . 50,000 117,878
Net Reserves .. .. £502,634 £428,340
There is now only £52,466 of reserves over
and above the amount estimated as required
to cover policy liabilities, which are calcu-
lated on the basis that funds will continue
to earn 4 p.c. for the duration , of policies, a
higher expectancy of earnings than is gener-
ally allowed by life offices. However, the
directors have ear-marked £50,000 of gen-
eral reserves as a “special reserve in excess
of the actuary’s valuation.” If that proves
a necessary provision for policy-holders,
then only £2466 remains in general reserves,
and on the other side are “establishment”
accounts : life, £50,000 ; general, £67,878. That
means that £115.412 of shareholders’ paid
capital of £328,366 has disappeared.
The most serious aspect of the clean-up
is that previous accounts have been entirely
misleading. On the strength of the pub-
lished figures the old directors (1) per-
mitted the issue of shares at a
stiff premium—a quarter-million gross was
collected from shareholders in this way in
two years; (2) divs. were paid to share-
holders (£59,277 in 1920-21) ; and (3)
bonuses amounting to £51,167 were allotted
to policy-holders. Recent happenings con-
firm The Bulletin’s suspicions expressed
last year that shareholders’ premiums had
been providing shareholders’ divs. On its
own showing, neither the stiff share-
premiums nor the distributions to share-
holders and policy-holders wefe justified,
the directors having apparently been misled
by bogus “surpluses.” Fortunately share-
holders woke up in time. Their new Board
of directors is to be commended for its
promptness in effecting a clean-up, but how
it has dealt with officers responsible for
the mess is not disclosed. It has made
a good start, but the biggest difficul-
ties will be to reduce Life costs to a level
which premium income warrants, and to
devise means of effecting a rescue in the fire,
marine and accident department. Perhaps
Selby Wood’s return to duty may help the
directors; but unless the faction fight which
has been proceeding for some months among
shareholders, directors and the staff is
promptly ended, and responsible officers be-
come impressed with the necessity of cutting
costs, the A.P.A. will crash. The new direc-
tors need to go further still with their in-
vestigations, particularly in the matter of
risks the co. has underwritten.
So far there is no need for anxiety on
the part of policy-holders. The directors,
by setting aside £50,000 more than actuarial
requirements, show that they at least realise
their responsibilities to policy-holders. There
are tangible assets £200,000-odd in excess of
the amount necessary to meet current policy-
liabilities. And these assets are mostly a
healthy lot earning a good rate of interest.
Of the balance-sheet total of £1,214,821 at
December 31, more than three-fifths
(£736,506) were Government securities.
Freehold properties (premises in four capi-
tals) had a book value of £178,016; loans
on mortgage and policies totalled £69,972,
and cash and other assets, as overhauled by
the directors, totted up £112,450. On the
other hand, the co. has borrowed extensively
to finance its premises and War-Loan hold-
ings.

In 1920 Burns-Philp followed the lead of the
C.S.R. and transferred most of its South Sea
interests to a pup in which it took a half-
million ordinaries, and to which shareholders
subscribed a quarter-million new capital.
But the division of interests has not been
accompanied by results anything like those
disclosed by the C.S.R.’s subsidiary. The
latter was recently restored to the parent
and,'it returned in cash all the gift capital
allotted in the float, together with some lus-
cious bonuses. The 8.-P. South Sea: holder
probably wishes that his parent co. had also
taken back the Islands interests—so that he
might get a div. Since world’s prices of
Islands produce collapsed this subsidiary has
had a comparatively cold time. Earnings
have been curtailed by low prices, while the
depression has also restricted the turnover
of general merchandise. No doubt there have
been failures amongst the big crowed who are
partly financed by the co., and disclosed
results have probably been affected by pro-
visions for doubtful accounts. The South
Sea Co.’s gross profits have declined in this
way: 1920. £208,791; 1921, £164,764; 1922,
£91,869. Results for the three years have
been as follows :

1922.. 4,192 Nil 4,192 33,337
On its holding in the subsidiary the parent
co. received £50,000 in its 1921 financial year
(it balances in March annually and the
South Sea Co. three months earlier), £37,500
in 1922, and nothing for the past year. Mak-
, ing allowance for these figures in the intro-
ductory table, the parent’s business is obvi-
ously flourishing. The growing profits, inde-
pendent of South Sea divs., are rather a
paradox, in view of the parent’s own Islands
interests. Not all that trade was passed over
to the subsidiary : it took over interests in
groups not controlled by the Commonwealth ;
but the management evidently considered it
wise policy for the subsidised parent co. to
retain interests in the Australian-controlled
groups. Anyhow, Western Pacific branches
(Papua and New Britain) are still run by
the parent. 8.-P. accounts do not disclose
the extent of the Commonwealth Govern-
ment subsidies, but as the votes cannot be
definitely regarded as recurring income the
co.’s accounts would be more satisfactory if
they showed the allocation of the sub-
sidies. For the 1922 financial year the Com-
monwealth subsidised the Pacific shipping
and mail services to the extent of 149,167,
and for the 12 months ended June 30 this
year £50,200 was voted. Obviously, these
subsidies have an important effect on 8.-P.
profits, and their influence must not be over-
looked by the investor. The time may come
when consideration of the agreement will go
before a Parliament less friendly, or more
hard-up, than those which have approved
subsidies in the past.
The parent co.’s profits shown in the intro-
ductory table take credit for £19,447 net
added to insurance and sundry reserves dur-
ing the year. Depreciation allowances, etc.,
not included, have been as follows: 1921,
£88,835; 1922, £106,587; 1923, £96,284. In
addition, £25,000 of profits have been taken
in each of the past two years to write down
the book value of the fleet. The Bulletin
will be surprised if these allowances are not
wholly additions to internal reserves. Dur-
ing the period of abnormally high shipping
values there was no writing up or any re-
construction affecting that asset, and depre-
ciation had apparently received full attention
in previous years. Possibly the trend of
happenings in the Pacific prompts the
strengthening of internal reserves: apart
from recent trading difficulties there are
other factors affecting the co.’s position. For
instance, the South Sea Go. directors
announce—
Owing to trading restrictions imposed in the
Marshall Islands, the co. suffered a heavy loss
through being precluded from continuing trading in
that territory, now held by the Japanese under
mandate from the League of Nations.
Whether its field will be further invaded in
this way only the future can tell. Mean-
while, the parent co. is strengthening its
position by remodelling the Morinda and
adding a new 3300-ton passenger-steamer to
its fleet.
The old-timer is, of course, getting fat
returns from his investment. Only 13 years
ago, when £350,000 of reserves were capital-
ised, the co. was supposed to have been re-
organised on a 5 p.c. div. basis. But another
£lOO,OOO of reserves have sifice been trans-
ferred, and 10 p.c. p.a. has been paid for the
past four years. The parent has visible re-
serves of three-quarters of a million assisting
1-1 million of paid capital, which places if
in a strong position as a div.-payer. Its
actual strength is not - isible from the pub-
lished accounts, because all belongings are
tied up in four parcels which hide the extent
of liquid resources and actual book values of
the fleet and properties.

This is the Tas. Permanent’s 36th year. At
the 27th milestone it was nursing three-
quarters of a million of estates; three years
ago the figures touched a million; but since
then progress has been slower, and at March
31 the book value of trusts was £1.055,775.
Paid capital is £lO,OOO, in 10,000 £5 shares
paid to £1; and the co. has also accumulated
£12,033 of reserves. But these funds are
giving only mild returns: interest and rents
for the. past year, prior to paying rates and
taxes, amounted to £1075, and gave slightly
less than 5 p.c. on average funds. But com-
missions from trustee operations (£3795),
less all expenses (£2667), made £ll2B more
available for shareholders. So the net profits
represented 22 p.c. on paid capital, and a sub-
stantial surplus remained after paying 15 p.c.
divs. At March 31 the co.’s belongings—the
bond insuring clients’ money against mistakes
and leakages—consisted of public securities,
£9250; mortgages, £7303; premises, £3OOO
(written down from £5000) ; cash, £2175;
book debts and odds and ends, £1456. Lia-
bilities amounted to only £257, and there
were net assets, after the div. distribution,
with a book value of £22,033.

Elder’s Automatic Irrigation (Aus-
tralia) , Ltd. —A Melbourne crowd, headed
by Sunshine H. Y. McKay and sharebroker
Fred Tbonemann, are introducing this co.
to acquire the rights of Maorilander Donald
Elder’s “automatic system of aerial irriga-
tion,” a simple watering device which, in its
early stages, was awarded the gold medal
and grand prize at the Panama Exhibition
by world’s horticultural and agricultural ex-
perts. They reported that the system would
“revolutionise the present wasteful methods.”
The apparatus consists of a repeater, a regu-
lator and a sprayer, which automatically
perform, with a minimum volume of water,
all the w T etting desired over any area or any
shape. The Australian co. undertakes to
pay £50,000 cash to the vendor Maoriland
concern, which in part return underwrites
38,000 £1 shares. Nominal capital is
£125,000, and the public is invited to sub-
scribe £90,000. Wm. Langton, who secured
the rights for the Commonwealth, and who
undertakes to manage the concern and pay
portion of preliminary exes., is to receive
10,000 fully-paids. The prospectus does not
go into details of cost of manufacture and
of selling prices, but broadly anticipates pro-
fits. Investors who do not feel inclined to
take for granted the prospectus claim that
“this seems certain to be one of the most
useful and liighly-profitaole inventions of the
period,” and that it is “confidently believed”
that it will prove “a money-maker that
excels the ordinary business investment, both
in safety and profit,” may get deeper into
facts and figures by buttonholing some of
the principals in the float.
W. G. Gillett’s attempt to revive Cobar
(N.S.W.) is taking shape. A proposal is
afoot to float Peak Mines, N.L., to take
over the Brown Lode, Conqueror, Blue Peak,
Triangle and other leases at the Peak. A
10-hd. battery and considerable plant is
already installed, and for the whole outfit it
is proposed to ask £3OOO cash and £15.000
in fully-paids in a £50,000 co. of 2s. shares,
350,000 of which will be available for the
public. On this basis the float will give a
working capital of £30,000, and it is proposed
to earmark £9OOO for a development cam-
paign during the first 12 months. W. i'S.
Curteis, formerly of Gt. Cobar, considers
that the amalgamation of the leases will give
them a new life. Mainshafts are down 121 ft.
in the Brown Lode, 260 ft. in the Conqueror
and 237 ft. in the Blue Peak, but develop-
ment has so far'been limited to the area
around the shafts, though one level has been
driven on one lode at 100 ft. between the
former two shafts. Only four of the eight
lodes known to exist have been opened up to
any extent, and these four have not been
thoroughly prospected. Below water-level
practically no work has been done, though in
one place in the Conqueror bottom workings
ore averaging 2oz. gold has been exposed f >r
the full width of a drive. To begin with
the promoters estimate ore in sight at 7590
tons worth £13.000 in gold and silver. Cur-
teis’s report adds :
It is now proved that the rich ore-shoots con-
tinue down. I discovered that the recently-worked
rich shoot of silver ore in the Brown Lode (averag-
ing £32 per ton) which was cut off by a slide and
considered worked out still continues beneath this
slide... .This discovery puts a different complexion
on the field, and justifies development for finding
the continuation of rich shoots above the 100 ft.
level and the downward continuation of several rich
shoots beneath this level.
His advice is to concentrate on development
of the West lode in Brown Lode-Conqueror
ground at 226 ft., and on the East lode at
100 ft. and 226 ft. That will reveal the posi-
tion above water-level and indicate possibili-
ties deeper. If anticipations are confirmed
by development, a plant to cost about
£17,000 will go up. Some handsome returns
have been won in the past from more or
less haphazard working by small parties,
and there appear possibilities for Peak Mines
if sound and comprehensive development of
the area is undertaken.

Government Geologists E. C. Andrews and
L. F. Harper have had another look at South
Lucknow, in response to that co.’s applica-
tion for a further financial lift. The re-
quest has been refused: Mr. Andrews con-
siders the co. is not making full use of its
calling power to carry out the required
prospecting. Fie recommends that the direc-
tors should engage a consulting engineer and
provide adequate funds to finance vigorous
prospecting. The trouble with South Luck-
now to date has been that all the money
spent has done little more than bear out
geological theory, and given occasional, tan-
talising glimpses of values to encourage hones
that rich makes would be encountered.
Efforts to locate them, however, have failed.
Still, there is no reason for shareholders to
become disheartened with the field: from the
beginning it was clear that, unless the co.
had extraordinary luck, the proving would
be costly and difficult—just as it was in the
old days. South Lucknow is still a pros-
pecting venture with possibilities. But it
hasn’t a ghost of a chance if directors don’t
compose their differences as to mining-policy
and agree on a sound prospecting pro-
gramme. Lately they have been engaged in
a windy warfare by circulars, and striving
to win personal battles with proxies.
The prospecting shafts which are being
sunk at the Crown gold-mine, JVlt. Bombandy
(N.S.W.), are reported to be showing good
values. An experienced mining man who
inspected the property a few days since con-
firms the general opinion that it is a very
promising surface-show, but that it is pre-
mature to talk about defined lode or lodes.
There is quartz here, there and everywnere,
all carrying gold, but giving the impression
of a series of blows, which may be only super-
ficial. Nevertheless, they might give a good
tonnage.
* * * #
Christmas Gift, Cullinga, near Coota-
mundra (N.S.W.), has so far failed to re-
deem its early promise. According to old-
time reports the average yield was about
loz. of £3 bullion per ton. The latest crush-
ings have averaged only Bdwt. and 6dwt. per
ton, which is unpayable. Extensive de-
velopment work at 300 ft. has failed to locate
any ore corresponding in value with that in
levels above, but the manager believes
further driving will disclose a payable block.
Meanwhile, calls will have to be made, much
to the disappointment of the principals, who
had what seemed good reasons to expect
better results.
# * * *
Mt. Boppy has disposed of portion of its
large plant at Canbelego (N.S.YV.), but is
holding sufficient for its own requirements
should another attractive proposition become
available. At present, after a long search
throughout the State, the co. is concentrating
on the Junction Reefs, near Mandurama,
which it is developing under option. The
show is responding well, and there are pros-
pects of a considerable tonnage of pay-ore.
A parcel of forfeited shares in the Big
Ben Gold Syndicate, whose mine is s tuatcd
at Gundagai (N.S.W.). was offered by auc-
tion at the Stock Exchange the other day,
but was withdrawn “owing to bidders re-
maining mute.” The manager bewails the
apathy of the public towards the mine, the
shaft of which, we are told, is “fitted with
a ship-rope and substantial ladderways”;
which, further, has 2oz. stone at the surface
and 2|ft. of Boz. stone at 50ft., with the
reef topped at 75ft. but not broken thr ugh
—why is not explained. Big Ben has been
ringing out this sort of joy ul news with
monotonous regularity for a long time past.

From Grampian Hills manager R. F.
Burton :
Portable sluicing-plants (B. 31/5/’23) were intro-
duced to the New England tin-fields to treat small
holdings which did not warrant the expenditure
entailed in the installation of heavier and more
economical plants, and for this purpose they proved
a success.
Having treated ground with a portable steam-
plant at a cost of 6d. per yd., I contend that the
high cost of production may be attributed, not so
much to the use of that type of plant, as to the
increased cost of labor and material, coupled with
the fact that nearly all the remaining dredging
areas now under treatment require a lavish expendi-
ture on explosives and labor to prepare the ground
for sluicing, or are so stony and shallow as to
be classed as unsuitable for sluicing. The strongest
argument against the portable steam-plant is that
its' power is limited, and the plant of 40 h.p. in
“easy” ground requires the same personnel as the
400-h.p. plant.
I have been concerned over this problem for
seme time, and have now concluded that the intro-
duction of a simple innovation will enable the yard-
age capacity of these portable plants to be doubled,
in good sluicing ground, without employing addi-
tional labor.

Westralia’s mineral output for 1922 was
£2,801,626 less than for 1921. Gold turned
in £2,286,325; coal £381,555; copper,
£20,379; silver, £18,164, and tin £10,930.
Divs. at £1u1,251 were £115,707 smaller.
The shrinkage in production is attributed
mainly to continued high ecsts and the
depressed base-metal markets. The aver-
age value of auriferous ores treated was
53.1J5. compared with 51.565. in 1921; but,
at Kalgoorlie, which produced over 70 p c. of
the whole, values fell from 50.375. to 48.635.
This may mean (1) that the grade of ore
available for treatment is still declining; or
(21 that owing to more scientific mining,
and slightly cheaper supplies, producers
were able to make ore of lower grade pay.
The Mines Department report gives costs, as
supplied by the Chamber for Mines, for each
year 1915 to 1921 inclusive, but no figures
are presented for 1922. “It is not possible
for many reasons,” says the report, “to
give accurate figures relating to working
costs that w T ould not be misleading. It is,
however, safe to assume that they are in
excess of previous years.” There" is some
doubt on that point; and the failure of the
Chamber of Mines to present figures is
almost sure to have a certain construction
put on it by the unions.
The Empire boom (W.A.) having burst,
co. promoters and option-holders are in full
retreat from Sandstone. The Mararoa is
still holding on to its 13 leases, but if the
directors want to conserve shareholders’ in-
terests they will get out. There is nothing
visible on the field suitable for a co. One
option-qo., the Pioneer, which was floated in
Perth and Adelaide on the strength of
Empire reports, and lost nearly half its capi-
tal in prospecting a worthless lease, intended
to wind up, but the lure of the market
proved too strong, and the directors are now
seeking another gambling counter.
Kanowna (W.A.) deep-leads are again
attracting attention in Melbourne. The
last time they were talked about a syndicate,
headed by the Bryants, acquired large areas,
put down several test holes, and after spend-
ing a fair sum of money, came to the con-
clusion that values were too uncertain. Opti-
mists claim that capital only is needed to win
profits from the continuation of these old
alluvial workings; but cautious mining men
consider that heavy ground and capricious
values of the wash make the proposition
unattractive.
“O.B.”: Adelaide, and probably Melbourne,
may shortly be asked to find capital to work
the Surprise leases at Bulla Bulling, near
Coolgardie (W.A.). They are likely to be
sorry if they do. A rich jpatch was struck
near the surface, and the reports of several
persons who were “impressed with the pros-
pects’’ were published in the local papers;
but work by option-holders established that
it is no good for a co.

North Fingall Extended, on the advice of
Dave Welch, has thrown up its option at
Warriedar (W.A.). He found some good
ore, but the average value was not nearly
enough.

New Blue, Bendigo, has put. up a splendid
record for the half-year: 12,720 tons yielded
12,3200 z., an average of about 19.36dwt.
Divs. have totalled 13s. 6d. per share
(£30,375). jLast year’s returns were: 25,000
tons, 18,1550 z. (141dwt.) ; divs., £81,500.

“Old Alluvialist” on Langi Logan pros-
pects :
“Optic” (B. 24/5/’23) is quite right in increas-
ing the expenditure by various cos. to over
£200,000, but, because it may seem hopeless to
expect the present co. to wipe out this debit, that
is no fair reason for covertly sneering at its
plucky work. It is ungenerous to refer to the
Langi Logan Co. as having “bad repute behind it” —
“bad luck” would be more appropriate. The posi-
tion now is that from the main east-reef drive it
the south end the co. has opened up an area 620 ft.
long (not 400 feet as stated by “Optic”) by 300 ft.
wide with, as officially reported, good gold still show-
ing in the ends of the east and west wash-drives,
so that the actual width is not known. This, when
cut up for panelling, represents 6000 fathoms—
certainly a small area to mention in connection with
a big alluvial mine. It has been reticulated in all
directions by wash drives, which have disclosed
excellent values throughout. There was no selection
for values in panning these drives; they follow
geometrical lilies adapted to the System Of working.
From these drives the co. has treated 133 fathoms
for 5500 z., a trifle over 4oz. per fathom. This fact,
in itself, is a complete answer to “Optic’s” assertion
that “no one has dared to estimate above 30dwt.
for the lead in either New or South Langi.” North
of the main east-drive there is a proved, area of
about 3000 fathoms of 3oz. wash.
Manager Toole is positive that he can cover all
working costs with loz. per fathom, or £36,000
for these areas, leaving a credit on mine account
of £72,000. At this end the co. has over iialf-a-
mile to go to reach its south boundary. The wash
in the extreme south wash-drive prospects 4oz.
to the fathom. Bores put down by the Government
across the southern boundary disclosed heavy bodies
of wash recorded as “carrying gold.” The co.’s
bores show that it is “valuable ground, apparently
running level.” It cannot be said that it is
proved ground, beyond the face of the south wash
drive, but Only blind prejudice would assert that
the available evidence doesn’t indicate an excellent
prospect.
“Optic” is entirely wrong when he writes about
the ground to the south being “deeper and wetter”
than it was to the north. At one time, with pumps
in two shafts, over 5,000,000ga1. water were raised
per day; now, with one pump going slowly and
draining from north to south, the maximum flow is
a million gallons. The South Langi has compara-
tively little water to pump'.
“Optic” is contradicted point blank by Stanlev
Hunter, the Government geologist, who superintended
the boring at Ararat, as to “no tributaries coming
in to the south.” To the east there is a big lead
which, that officer contended, was the main Langi
lead. It is still referred to as Hunter’s lead, and
the contours, as shown by bores, indicate that it
must junction at or near the boundaries of Langi
and South Langi. It is quite a reasonable conjec-
ture that other leads will join the Langi from the
west, just as the Cathcart lead did to the north.
“Optic” despises the extensive area of wash left
in the northern section at No. 1 shaft, but “Battler”
Bill Toole doesn’t endorse this “ruling out.” The
puddlers have proved the area to be worth 28dwt.
per fathom, and, with full squads of men and all
the puddlers going, this, even at ruling high costs,
should be made to pay. Anyhow, Toole is going lo
tackle it again at an opportune time. A “squad”
consists of nine men (six miners and three trackers),
and their work shows an average of about 55
fathoms per fortnight. It is expected that in a few
weeks four or five squads will be at work.

The bore of the Queensland Coastal Oil
Concessions at Tewantin is down almost
300 ft. H. E. King has issued a statement
that oil has been found in small quantities
and tested. Dr. Jensen recently examined
the area and has given a report favorable
to the chances of the basin containing oil.
There is some doubt, however, whether the
bore is in the right spot, and probably an-
other position will be tried.
The Canary, Kangaroo Hills (N.Q.), has
responded so well to development that the co.
is exercising its option, and is paying owner
Lennox £4OOO down and promises £4OOO
more within 12 months “subject to the co.
being in a position to pay, or had paid divs.,
to the amount of £8000.”

Electrolytic Zinc anticipates treating 25
tons of zinc-ore per day at Zeehan (Tas.).
This is part of the scheme to work the enor-
mous deposits locked up in the Read-llose-
bery district. A deputation of Rosebery resi-
dents recently waited on the Mines Minister
to protest against the way the Electrolytic
Zinc is stifling industry on that field. The
Minister promised to look into the matter,
but the deputation has not much faith in
his ability to move the big concern.

Timber troubles and tin at £l6O kept
Tongkah Compound No. 2 profits for last
year down to £4OSB. The plant stood up
nobly to a forest of logs; it ladled out
770,000 c. yd. for 2811 tons oxide, an aver-
age of 0.819 lb. per ,vd~. Values worked out
at 7.84 d. a yd., costs 6.15 d.; and the co.
netted £B9 7s. 54d. per ton oxide. The co.
now owes Tongkah Compound £33,876. At
the balance cash amounted to £5575, and
spares and stores, etc., had a book value of
£5600.
The samples of ozokerite, or mineral-wax,
from a salt-lake on the shores of the Great
Australian Bight have been analysed and
proved to contain crude petroleum of a paraf-
fin base. The country is composed of sand,
sandstones and limestone, and is on the
eastern edge of the Nullarbor Plain. The oil
exists, in the form of an emulsion of brine
and oil, underneath the salt surface, and is
mixed with the gypsum and gypseous marls
which are abundant in the vicinity of Lake
Mac Donnell. There is a rift in the granite,
and an ancient marine estuary covers about
70 square miles of country. Ozokerite is
found on the raised beaches at the estuary
mouth, and it probably exists under the sand
dunes in larger quantities.

“James B.”: “Yarrum’s” game Austra

were carried in a pram, which he pushed,
while two dogs, fastened by ropes to the
axle, pulled. He had come from Beechworth

about three months. The old chap was quite
independent, and refused my offer of tucker.

“Feather”” (Broome j-~ f : Pearl-shell openers

“Randolph Rentless”: The Australian is
not supposed to have the ingrained love of
titles of the Briton; but one Sydney firm
has' solved the problem of a contented staff
by a fountain of honor which sprays om
high-sounding designations. For instance,
the chief man in the footwear—-the Boot-
Department Manager—has, to assist him, a
Deputy-8.-D.-M., a Principal-Assistant, a
Lady Manager, a Deputy-Manageress, a
Pi’incipal Lady Assistant, a De-
puty-Principal Lady Assistant and
a Leading Saleswoman. That is
all the staff, except a boy. and he
is Chief Messenger. All the other
departments are similarly equip-
ped ; and one of the firm fold me
slyly that the system yields more
peace than money could buy.

“Geo Rich”: My entry for the Small-
cheque Trophy is one drawn by the Tost
master-General’s Department in Westralia
in favor of G. M. Roberts for one penny.
The typed curiosity is signed by two officials,
and the payee is asked to cash it immediately.
He is also requested to acknowledge receipt
—which he can hardly do without spending
2d. in postage. Roberts, who is a Kal-
goorlie mine-manager, and a member of the
Perth Uni. Senate, has a small sheep-run in
South Groperland. The penny is a ouar-
ter’s rent for a building used as a telephone
exchange on his property.

“Wilfrido”: The Cooper case is without
a parallel in the legal history of Maoriland.
The two accused, husband and wife, were
charged with the murder of four infants
whose bodies were discovered by the police,
after a long and diligent search, buried in a
section of land owned by the Coopers at New-
lands. The defence for the man (who was
convicted) relied mainly on the failure of
the Crown to identify the babies. For the
woman it was maintained that she was
under the hypnotic influence of her husband
and incapable of knowing what was go ng on
around her. Various extraordinary features
supported this theory. The male was a
small, grey-haired man of 43, with dark,
piercing eyes set far back in his head. The
wife was a frail creature of 27, who had,
without protest, seen the mistress of her hus-
band give birth to two children while she
was relegated to the position of household
drudge. Her counsel by. continued reference
to metal discs and mesmerism created an
atmosphere of mystery about the woman’s
part in the horrible business, and Justice
Chapman in his summing up seemed dis-
posed to think that the propositions of Coue
and Chako in regard to auto-suggestion and
metaloscopy, as propounded to the jury, were
applicable to this case. On the jury acquit-
ting her, there were signs of enthusiasm in
the ladies’ gallery. Throughout an unprece-
dented crowd followed the unfolding of the
strange document; queues were formed at 7
in the morning.

ing in Dowling-street, Sydney, to a new one
at Bellevue Hill. Founded as a memorial
to the Jewish philanthropist and centen-
arian, the Home is a model in its way. In
the new premises old couples will be able to
live together in their own quarters. There
fire some children, too —orphans who are
awaiting adoption by kindly-disposed
families. Contrary to the general belief,
a large percentage of the Jewish people,
even in Australia, are poor, some very poor;
but the race has a habit of looking after
its own needy and submerged. There is
even a society which advances interest-free
loans to pob'r Jews who want a start or a
helping hand, and it is remarkably-seldom
that it is “let down” by borrowers.
NOT HER FAULT.
MISTRESS : “Were you entertaining in the
kitchen last night. Bridget?"
BRIDGET: “Not very, I’m afraid, ma’am. But
I did me best with what provisions
there was."
“Wonthaggi”: How about this for the
mixed-metaphor competition? Stump, orating
on our corner relative to the proposed 15 per
cent, levy for the maintenance of the Mait-
land and Newcastle miners, addressed the
assembled comrades as follows : "Do you think
us working bullocks is going to be milked dry
to keep those goats on the other side in lux-
ury? Not for mine!”
“Umfaan”: I had to have one, so I dived
into the nearest pub and asked for a pint
out of a pewter.
The girl bustled
around to the front
bar, returned, and
asked me if I would
mind a glass. I in-
sisted on metal.
“Well, you’ll have
to wait,” she said

she explained that
there were only

lets in the hotel,
and a “coupler reg’-
lars” from the fell-
m o n g e r y were
using them when I
spoke. “The boss
only said yesterday
not to fill ’em if
the bar’s busy, as
he can’t afford to
risk losing ’em.” I
looked at the scars
on the old warrior
I was handling.
“Been in the family
a long time?” I
suggested brightly.
“Oh, no. But the
boss needs them for
hop-overs.” “How?”

“Centurion” : Another example of how the
tropics destroy the initiative and sap the
energy or the white race. The little Austra-
lian who supplied the illustration is an 11-
year-old hero named Litchfield, who lives
in Darwin. His smaller brother, aged 5,
fell down a 30ft. well with 10ft. or more of
water at the bottom. The elder brother
dropped down after him, and, though he
hurt his foot badly in the dive, he held up
the little chap until assistance came.
* * * S’!
“Cripps Clark”: The gentleman in black
with his collar buttoned at the back was
being entertained in the dining-room of the
Hotel Murphy by an admiring churchwarden.
Under the unaccustomed spur of a large
bottle of lager they chatted freely upon
parish matters. The two “commercials” at
the same table appeared only mildly inter-
ested until the cleric changed the topic with
the genial inquiry: “Have you heard that
funny story about the widow and the motor-
cars V’ His friend expressing ignorance, the
other propounded his conundrum: “If a man
married a young widow with two small chil-
dren, what motor-cars would he have?” The
churchwarden gave it up without a struggle,
but one could see the commercials’ faces
twitching. The clerical humorist glanced at
the impassive features of the waitress a
moment and then supplied the answer: “A
second-hand bzzie and two runabouts.”
“That’s good. That’s very good,” pronounced
the churchwarden, and chuckled till it began
to get on the nerves of one of the bagmen.
Assuming a very shocked expression the lat-
ter cut in : “Pardon me, your Reverence, but
as a Methodist I’m grieved to hear one of the
cloth telling smoking-room stories at a public
dining-table.” The rest of the meal was eaten
in silence; but one could almost hear the par-
son dissecting his fatuous riddle in a vain
attempt to discover a double entendre.

“Michael Onial”: I was reading the paper
to a cocky friend of mine when I chanced
upon the report of Roy Governor’s escapades.
“I see there’s another Governor out,” I re-
marked to the old man. “Huh,” he replied
“that makes eight of the blanks noAV.” ’

“C. 3” : Ticket-collectors in the Allied coun-

would seem to suggest. I remember an occa-
sion when- the' last tram for Harfleur from
Le Havre had got under way crowded with
Diggers making the most of their leave-
passes. The girl-conductor had no great
difficulty in collecting fares till she arrived
among the knot of more or less inebriated
warriors swaying precariously on the rear

excuses and irrelevances, from protests of
insolvency to hilarious invitations to “pro*

Foch 7” one hilarious soul inquired. “Ah,
oui, monsieur,” was the response. “Well”
—this with the triumphant air of one who
slams the joker on his opponent’s right
bower —“Ffich pay.” But the damsel,
though perfectly good-tempered, proved
obdurate. She simply jerked the bell-cord
and announced that the tram would wart
till the messieurs paid—or got out. And
wait it did till public opinion, seeing the
guardroom ahead for coming late oft leave,
forced the dilatories to meet their obliga-

“Solomon M.”: A real highbrow butted
into the Irish-envoys discussion with the
theory that persons humping a British pass-
port can’t be shut out because of the firm,
not to say haughty, language on the docu-
ment :
We request arid require in the name of his Majesty
all those whom it may concern to allow the bearer to
pass freely without let or hindrance, and to afford him
every assistance and protection of which he may stand
in need.
It sounds formidable, but really it can’t be
taken seriously. The assistance of which
the bearer stands in need is too often £lOO
or more, and the protection he most wants
is frequently from his deserted wife, or his
creditors, or the justly infuriated police.
To let him pass in absolute freedom would
include letting him go on to the flower-beds,
or on the wrong side of the traffic, or into
private property, probably after dark, that
being a favorite time for passing on to
private property. Yet it isn’t so much the
passing that is objected to as the stoppage.
And the silly document says nothing about
stoppage; it is a passport, and the beggar
can’t pass if we allow him to come ashore
and remain-
“M.D.” looks back a few years:—
Amidst the universal sorrow at the loss of Herbert
Maitland his colleagues were not unmindful of the
great obligations he was under to the genial Irish-
man who was connected first with Prince Alfred and
afterwards with Sydney Hospital, and who was, in
the infancy of the Medical School, the lecturer on
medical jurisprudence. It was a lucky day for Mait-
land when, after filling a resident position at Sydney
Hospital, he became assistant-surgeon, and had Wil-
liam Henry Goode as his chief. I remember in the
far-off years being present at Sydney Hospital when
Maitland was operating, and Goode told me, with a
characteristic smile, that it was his young assistant’s
50th case of the radical cure for hernia —an excellent
tally for a mere assistant and good fortune extended
to few. I know a surgeon, very distinguished now,
who had to wait until his senior passed away before
he could get more than his dole of two beds. His
chief wouldn’t part with an extra bed under
any prefer. whatever; so a long wait resulted.
I know ‘mother specialist who “did” out-
patients, lut was allowed no beds at all, which
prevented him doing operative work. He asked his
chief whether he couldn’t have a couple of beds to
treat operation cases. The senior man turned quite
pale at the audacity of the proposal. From the
very outset of his career Maitland encountered none
of these difficulties, being happily associated with the
best-natured man in Sydney, a man for whom we
had the greatest affection, and to whom we listened
with respect—albeit he lectured on medical juris-
prudence, the driest and dullest subject in the cur-
riculum. Some of the laurel leaves that have strewn
Maitland’s grave have disappeared: generous himself,
his spirit, I think, has reverently laid them upon
the grave of the older man who in the warmth of
his heart gave the youngster a chance —with such
far-reaching consequences. I had the privilege of
30 years’ fellowship with Maitland; and I believe
that if it were possib’e to get from him a message
to students it would be this: “Spend all the time
you can in the dissecting-room.” Certainly it was
that way he reached his own celebrity.
“X2X” : Three cases of sleeping sickness
have been discovered in different parts of
Australia during the last few years. This
suggests a clear possibility that the causa-
tory organism of the disease has found its
way into Australia. In Central and "South-
western Africa the organism is transmitted
through the tsetse fly; but it has been estab-
lished that other insects may convey the in-
fection. Australia, while without tsetses,
may have some of these insects, and visitors
suffering from incipient forms of sleeping
sickness may act as hosts. Recent investi-
gations in Brazil and equatorial South
America show that the malady has a footing
in places where it was previously never sus-
pected ; which makes the matter all the
better worth looking into by the Common-
wealth authorities.

“A.F.” : Apropos the general good quality
of the native murderer compared with his
fellows. About 15 years ago I was doing
some work that would have taxed most
women —taking down the evidence in the
preliminary hearing of a murder trial at
Broome (W.A.). The case lasted several
days; the heat was tropical; witness after
witness droned or jabbered his testimony to
the click of my typewriter. The only wel-
come interlude for me was when, at the brief
afternoon interval, the black boy who offici-
ated as the local police sergeant’s cook and
rouseabout would appear at my elbow with
a tray bearing tea and some dainty cakes or
pastry. Every day there was a new kinfl of
cake; there never was such a pleasant break
in such a gruesome job. On finishing, I
thanked the sergeant for his kindly thought-
fulness and complimented him on his cook.
“You’d never believe, would you,” he re-
turned. “that the nigger who makes those
cakes committed three murders, and is serv-
ing his sentence for the last one now.”

“TI.K.”: This is the jubilee year of
Bathurst’s big St. Stanislaus’ College, which
has been conducted for the past quarter of a
century by the Vincentians. The foundation
of the present building; which cost about
£30.000, was laid on January 21, 1872, and
on September 8, 1873, the college was for-
mally opened by Dr. Quinn, first R.C. Bishop
of Bathurst. The jubilee celebrations will
take the shape of a re-union, which ex-
students from all parts of the Common-
wealth will attend. Prior to his transfer to
St. John’s Father O’Reilly presided at
“Stannies.” Nowadays the position is held
by Father John Hall, C.M. An old St.
Stan.’s boy himself, he was the first Aus-
tralian Vincentian ordained. (A decade ago
he was one of the most dashing centre three-
quarters in the west, and Bathurst’s most
prolific run-getter.) Included in the clerical
teaching staff, which with one exception is
wholly Australian, is a brother, lather
Mark Hall, C.M., who, like Fathers King,
Templeton and OTlea, is an ex-student.

“C.McL.”: Two or three years ago Mr.
Bonar Law had to retire from politics owing
to a high blood-pressure; he was. surely
tempting Providence when he resumed ms
political activities last year. It is much
eas.er to raise the blood-pressure than to get
it down again, and the trouble was evidently
only scotched. “Macquarie Street” (B.
24/5/’23) may be quite right in surmising
his loss of voice to be due to an aneurism,
for that may itself be due to the high press-
ure or be a cause of it —there are innumer-
able conditions which might lay up a poli-
tician’s voice, all made worse by his having
a high pressure. In a case like this a man
may feel perfectly well, even though his
blood-pressure is liigh enough to threaten to
stop his heart. But let him resume strenu-
ous work, and he will soon find his body
playing him false.

“Six-t&-Eight”: S.A. Criminal Court has
heard a quite unusual charge of murder of
a woman, by a woman, in a stand-up fight
on Oakbank racecourse on Easter Monday.
There was evidence of blows with a bottle.
But accused declared that deceased, her
friend but quarrelsome when in liquor,
attacked her with the vitreous weapon, that
she acted only in self-defence and had r.o idea
until next day that any serious result had
occurred, and that, anyway, deceased was
about the city for a day or two after and
might have got damaged then. A puzzled
jury at first professed itself unable to
agree, but finally called it manslaughter
“with a very strong recommendation.”
Judge Parsons, however, thohght it worth
four years. M *
“Skyrider”? One of the oldest landmarks
of the Goulburn (N.S.W.) district is
vanishing. The old Retreat Inn, on the
Gulien-road, about 10 miles from Goulburn,
is being dismantled; already it is a mere
ruin. The Retreat saw some stirring times.
Ben Hall, Gilbert and Dunn put in two or
three nights at different times under its
roof; handy to the bush and not far from
the roughest country in the district, it was
a good place for a ’rangers’ rest. It is
said that after Constable Nelson was shot
at Collector, the gang which had stuck up
that town rode across country and stayed a
day at the Retreat. Whether or not the
inn got its name from its hospitality to the
knights of the bush I cannot discover.
This ancient pub is not the only one on the
way to disintegration; there are a dozen
of "them in the district going to decay, while
others have been turned into farmhouses.
The motor-car goes quicker than the bullock-
team, and the country can put up with
longer spaces between drinks.
THE LOGIC OF THE SEX.

[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
“The Sydney Water Board still rigorously forbids
the use of garden hoses,”
All was happiness at Phloxville. Gentle horticul-
ture's joys
Engrossed the suburb’s best and bravest hearts.
There was Smith, of Emoh, Cross-street: his sweet-
peas had caused a noise
In many of the shire’s most distant parts.
And Brown, who grew his bulbs in one of Phlox-
ville’s choicest blocks ;
And Jones, of Mons, whose roses were as famous
as his stocks.
As the 9 a.m. banged townwards Smith and Brown
and Jones, of Mons,
Discussed the latest thing in wet manures;
Or the price of super-phosphates, which the suburb
used in tons;
Or chuckled at the devastating lures
Contrived by one or other to defeat the local snails,
Without the fag of slaying them by night in lime-
filled pails.
But the topic they most favored was the sinister
designs
Upon their cherished gardens’ very lives
Of the Water Board’s stern despots. At the risk
of heavy fines
Smith, Brown and Jones, their children and their
wives
Employed their hoses freely to revive each drooping
pea,
Or wilting bulb, or fading rose-bush, as the case
might be.
Came a c’.av when Brown said: “Smitho! You know
Curzori Grange, old sport—
The ‘Mod. Det. Bung. All Cons.,’ next door to
me? —
You can see its fowlhouse from your gate.” “Of
course,” was Smith’s retort.
“It’s let,” said Brown. “I wonder what he’ll be?”
Murmured Jones. “I fancy roses should be our new
neighbor’s line.
The last cove that had Curzon grew some quite as
good as mine.”
None upon the nine from Phloxville now hears Brown,
with laughter loud,
Recall his triumphs over snails and slugs;
Jones no longer speaks with biting scorn of “the
No-Water crowd” ;
No more does Smith refer to them as “mugs.”
Dead or dying are the roses that were once the pride
of Jones.
The bulbs of Brown, the peas of Smith are dry as
ancient bones.
Have you read the riddle, reader ? Guessed' aright
the cruel truth?
Solved the tragedy of Smith and Jones and Brown?
Yes. The Water Board without one touch of
sympathy or ruth,
As though its record black it wished to crown,
Had chosen an inspector Phloxville’s sylvan streets
to range,
And rented for his use the empty Mod Bung., Curzon
Grange.

James Craigie, Francis Mander and Alfred
Newman, pushed into M.L. Leg. Council last
week, are dashing youths of 70: they score
210 among them. Craigie, having learned
how to paint houses at Dunedin, set up his
ladder in Timaru. There he became a pros-
perous tradesman and a Seddonian Liberal,
succeeding William Ilall-Jones as M.P. when
William flitted away to take Pember Reeves’s
job as High Commissioner. Mander started
at 9 to mind sheep near Onehunga for
2s. 6d. a week. At 50 he was a rich man.
By that time thousands of acres on the
North Auckland peninsula had been swept
bare of the kauri pine, the big logs being
swallowed up in Mander’s mills at Puhipuhi,
Dargarville and Whangarei. Newman, son
of an Indian officer, took a medical degree
in London, but never seriously practised. He
is a sturdy little chap, with red hair and
crimson face, a violent opponent of beer and
a keen supporter of Rugby football. Most
of his life has been spent looking for new
jokes and battling for votes —two pursuits in
which a long purse is often a handicap. He
married one of the Featherston girls, so the
family goes back almost to the beginning of
things around Windy Wellington.
Edmund Molesworth, who died at Chats-
wood on Saturday, aged 76, had only one
real trouble in his happy and successful life.
Strangers were always confusing him latterly
on the one hand with Vol. Molesworth, the
combative Labor member, and, on the other,
with a third Molesworth who, at elections,
usually figures as a light of the North Syd-
ney Protestant Federation—the gentleman
who began a suit for libel against The Bul-
letin last September, and then apparently
forgot all about it. The kindly old English-
man who has just died (he arrived from
Warwickshire at the age of 3) had no-
thing of either the State Laborite or the
N. S. Wales sectarian in him. Yet he was
a keen politician and an even keener church-
man. He was M.L.A. for Newtown-Erskine-
ville for 13 years and a prominent Synods-
man. He left a family of seven—three sons
and four daughters.
“Jim G.”: The reappearance of the name
of Governor in the newspapers brings to mind
the story told about the last words of Jacky
Underwood, one of the chief actors in the
former Governor
drama. As he
walked jaunt-
ily to the scaf-
fo 1 d in Dubbo
Gaol ho asked:
“Will I be in
Heaven in time
for dinner?” The
prison chaplain
had done his job
so well that the
liangee felt it was
merely a few miles’
non-stop journey
to Heaven, and
that Dubbo was on
the main line.
E. J. L.
BREMNER, one
of the chiefs
of the National
Roads Assoc., which
has been persuad-
ing the Prime
Minister that the
States ought to
concentrate on
one thing at a
time, and that
the thing they
should concentrate
on next year is
good roads.
Arthur Andrews, one of the men who cap-
tained the movement which led to the forma-
tion of the A.W.U. in 1893, has just died.
As president of one of the two unions (Gen-
eral Laborers’ Union and Amalgamated
Shearers’) out of whose amalgamation the
A.W.U. was born, he was in the running
for the presidency of the big body; but
W. G. Spence got the job and held it until
1917. Andrews was 70 when the end came.
“Jeames”: Lord Chaplin, who died last
week,. aged 82, was about the handsomest old
man in England, and one of the most digni-
fied-looking in the world. His pontifical
manner, his gravity, his tall, portly figure
and the monocle which he retained even
while riding to hounds, made him an ideal
president of Boards of all descriptions; and
what with his personal popularity, which
was enormous, and his social pull (he mar-
ried a daughter of the third Duke of Suther-
land) he eventually achieved Cabinet rank
and a P.C. No more unintellectual man ever
rose so high. The humiliation of his life was
experienced at the hands of a woman. Forty-
seven years ago, on the eve of his marriage
to the beautiful widow of the fourth Marquis
of Hastings, he heard the news that she had
bolted with his 21-.vear-old friend, Sir George
Chetwynd. A mild social vendetta rages be-
tween Chetwynds and Chaplins over the
matter to this day.
“The Deacon” : Archbish. Duhig, of Bris-
bane, who is tearing into the Irish envoys, is
an Irishman that Australia caught young.
Beginning, like his fellow-Bananalander
Archie Bradley, in a butcher’s shop, he soon
caught the eye of Archbish. Dunne, who sent
him to the College of the Propaganda in
Borne. After his debut Dr. Dunne promoted
him to be Administrator of the Brisbane-
Cathedral, whence he was taken to succeed
Bishop Higgins, of Rockhampton, on that
prelate’s translation to Ballarat. All the
time, however, his eye was upon the coadju-
torship of Brisbane, which his friend pulled
off for him. When Dr. Dunne died —inci-
dentally cutting up for £120,000 —the rest was
easy. Duliig, however, missed the Sydney
’bus, the choice going to the at present
unknown Coadjutor-Archbish. Sheehan, who
makes his H.Q. at St. Benedict’s, Sydney.
“H.E.R.”: There is an older priest than
Dean Shanahan, of Victoria, who at 87 is
still in the vineyard. Moms. Burke, V.G.,
of St. Brigid’s, West Perth, is toeing the
mark at 89. He was ordained in Westralia
in 1858, at the age of 24, and had his share
of roughing it in the pioneering days when
a brumby was the only means of locomotion
around a parish something like 200 miles in
width.
Passed out in Maryborough (Q.) at 73,
William Mitchell, one-time M.L.A. and
Deputy-Laborleader in Bananaland. A Fal-
kirk man, he set up as a bookseller in Mary-
borough in 1882, and 12 years later entered
the House with A. J. Jones, Rankin, Buch-
ard and Somerset, all of whom except Jones
(now Minister for Mines) have left actiye
politics. In 1909 Mitchell was defeated in
company with some old Labor champions,
including Peter Airey—that was when T. J.
Ryan and E. G. Theodore first appeared.
Vowles, G. Morgan and Corser also were
returned at that election, the last named de-
feating Mitchell then and again in 1912.
Mitchell’s health failed after that, and he
never tried again.
C. M. Rogers, the new private sec. to Sir
Matthew Nathan, Gov. of Bananaland, is the
first station-owner to take on that ceremoni-
ous job. He owns Torilla station, near
Rockhampton, has tons of money, and is a
personal friend of Sir Matt. Rogers sought
to create a new fashion in Queensland men’s
dress by adopting shorts, soft shirt and
collar and no coat for his usual attire; but
though his bare knees have become a familiar
feature of the Rocky landscape, he has found
no disciples. Still if he can persuade his
Ex. to don the shorts in Brisbane he ought
to get the fashion swiftly on its feet.
The Speck’s University has now produced
a vice-chancellor of its own —William
Joshua Tilley Stops, who graduated LL.B.
in 1896—six years after the ’Varsity’s in-
ception. A little wiry man with a hard
face that belies his nature, Stops has
for years done much of 'the spade-work
which has placed the Uni. on its present
basis.. A lawyer by profession, he was a
partner of the present Administrator until
the latter was elevated to the Bench. His
father, who obtained local fame by consoli-
dating the Tas. Statute Law, is cheerily
approaching the nineties.
An Adelaide merchant, S. J. Attiah, has
been made a Bey—probably the only one
in Australia. Though a good Australian
for 26 years, he spent most ol last year
in Syria and Northern Africa, taking an
active part in public affairs during his stay.
He has now received from Tunis the title
of El Iftikhar, or Bey, with the approbation
of the French, who have the ruling hand.
W. J. Skewes, second member of the new
Federal Public Service Board, will probably
have a big say in administrative work, as
Major-Gen. White (chairman) and Brig.-
Gen. McGlynn (third member) are not so
intimately acquainted with civil-service ways.
Skewes began as an £BO-a-year clerk in the
Vic. Education Department in the late
’eighties. His first lift was to the job of
private sec. to “Yardstick” Sargood. then
Minister for Education and Defence in the
Munro Ministry (1890-92). Fie was Alec
Peacock’s right-hand man and sec. to royal
commissions till 1902, but only reached
the fourth class. Irvine, when he be-
came Premier, just 21 years ago, thrust
him aside, and let him become a “redun-
dant” officer in the Premier’s branch. Then
all the man in Skewes (he was 31) rose
up, and he transferred and started a new
career in the Commonwealth service, rising
step by step to his present £2OOO-a-year job
—a nice little lesson to the departmental
clock-watchers.
Andrew Lang Petrie, who got back as
member for Toombul in the Bananaland
Parliament, has long since made a habit of
that sort of thing. He turned up as a blush-
ing beginner in the Flouse as a representa-
tive for Toombul away back in May, 1893,
and has gone on representing the same part
of the State —before and after redistribution
—ever since. He is a Brisbane native, 69
years of age, and started in the Customs,
but later became manager of, and then
partner in, the contracting, building and
other industrial concerns of his father, John
Petrie. Twice he has been returned to Par-
liament unopposed, and this time he extin-
guished his opponent, the Independent can-
didate, C. M. Jenkinson (Mayor of Hamil-
ton), with a two-to-one majority.
The Methodist Conference in Adelaide has
had a sudden death during its sittings, not for
the first time. Basil Archer, from Tasmania,
who was 83 and had a weak heart, died in
his pew. He combined station-owning with
local preaching, and was at one time in the
Tas. Assembly.
Binghi in S. Aus. has lost his official Pro-
tector—W. G. South had held the job since
1908, after many years in the mounted police
at Alice Springs, Barrow Creek and other
Centralian places.
Westralia’s Premier JAMES MITCHELL ,
now on a visit to the Eastern States.
May 27 saw the last appearance of Joseph
Massey as organist at St. Andrew’s Cath-
edral, Sydney. He had been pumping out
anthems there for nearly half-a-century.
The annual muster of veterans in South
Aus. saw a big roll-call this year. Gover-
nor Bridges himself has 32 years’ service
behind him. Only four are left of the 32
veterans who were at the first of these
gatherings 20 years ago. All of them, Mo ;re,
Watson, Isley and Walker, are Crimean
men, and Watson was in the Indian Mutiny
as well. A number of the local men saw
service in Egypt 40 years ago, and yet man-
aged to take a hand in the scrap Kaiser
Bill started.
From a good pioneer’s daughter:—
"The Oldest” (B. 10/5/’23) says he under-
stands that the grave of my father, Janies Harrison,
the pioneer ice-maker, is unmarked. This is not
so. The residents of Geelong erected a slab ovev
the grave soon after my father’s sudden death.
Tom O’Callaghan, who has been lecturing
before the Royal Aus. Historical Society in
Sydney on “The Police Service of N. S.
Wales,” was the first ranker to be Chief
Commissioner of Police in Victoria. He
was born in 1845 at Baulkham Hills
(N.S.W.), where his father was a station
overseer, and he joined the force in 1867.
The Postal Department lost its most
ancient employee when Mrs. Bridget Mclner-
uey, postmistress at Collector (N.S.W.),
heard the call. She was 85, and had held
her job for 55 years. When she first took
possession, Collector was humming with the
gold-rush; but it is now so quiet that the
authorities saw no reason to appoint anyone
to relieve the old lady of duties that were
hardly worth mentioning.
Squired his last station, Charles McDoug-
all, of Lyndhurst, Warwick (Q.). He special-
ised in racing stock and shorthorn cattle —
Lyndhurst has sheltered some notable blood
horses in its day. There were 58 years
notched against McDougall on the stick of
time when the silent reaper called.
Timothy Coghlan, the Ma State’s Agent-
General, starts his 69th year on the 9th. He
is a Sydney native, and first waded to fame
through an ocean of figures, George Dibbs
having discovered his genius as a statisti-
cian. He joined the public service half-a-
century ago, and has since found light recrea-
tion in writing on heavy subjects. Coghlan
married, in 1897, a daughter of the late D. C.
Donnelly, M.L.A.
Hobart still has one of the old type of
shipbuilders in Tom Purdon, of Purdon and
Feathers tone. He designed the schooner
Valmarie, which is still earning her- tucker
after being twice wrecked and abandoned to
the underwriters. Another of his boats is the
Cartela, which flies the cock at her masthead
as the fastest steamer on the Derwent. “Old
Tom” carries the structure of his ships in
his turret. He is supoosed to have retired last
year at the age of 80 or so, but he is usually
handy to the yard if he is wanted.
Albert Byrne, the ancient tipstaff of Syd-
ney Supreme Court, has just finished his
41st year in the job. He is 75, but is not
touched by any retiring-age regulation, and
is still tough. He began as tipstaff to Jus-
tice Windeyer, served next for 16 years with
Justice Cohen, and since then has toiled under
Justice Ferguson. He sat through the Mt.
Rennie and Dean cases, and a score more
that made great trade for the evening papers
HIS SWAN-SONG.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
“Let me in a tavern die.”— Walter de Mapes.
Wise was he, that toper old,
Who, when tippling blithe and bold,
Counted naught the wisdom taught by the great in
story;
Turned his empty flagon down,
Called his present bliss his crown,
Hiccuped then
His prayer again:
“Heaven and Hell 1 wouldna ken —
Mihi est propositum in taberna mori!”
Through the mists of thick’ning time
Seems to me I hear the chime
Of the bell that warning fell: “Tippler, bent and
hoary”
(Down the street it sounded clear).
“Come, my lad, and leave the beer.”
“True,” he said,
“ ’Tis time for bed ;
Move me not till I be dead—
Mihi est jpropositum in taberna mori l”
“Let me sleep where’er you will
In the vale or on the hill;
Carve a cup upon my tomb as my claim to glory ;
Ne’er an anthem o’er me raise ;
Drop your windy blame or praise;
But until
The grave ye fill
Leave me here where flagons spill
Mihi est propositum in taberna mori!”
“In the land where I was born
Black-eyed lasses sweet as morn
Tread the grapes with feet that dance fairy-like
before ye;
If beside the bottle I
Sing my song before I die,
I may chance
To see them dance
While the wine recalls Romance—
Mihi est propositum in taberna mori!”
“Let who will slip out of Life
’Mid the tears of kin and wife ;
tVine to me was wife and dam—she who bred and
bore me.
Coward deed it were, I trow,
Should I dare desert her now ;
Leaf of vine
My brow entwine,
Ere I taste the bitter brine —
Mihi est propositum, in taberna mori!”

ABORIGINAUTIES
MADE IN AUSTRALIA
BARNES LINSEED OIL
“Edge o’ Beyond”: While I was out fish-
ing in Deception Bay, off Scarborough (Q.), recently,
a kookaburra, in an exhausted condition, flew across
the bow of the dinghy about two feet from where 1
was sitting, and settled on the water a few yards
away. It rested in this fashion quite happily for a
few minutes, with its tail cocked perkily out of the
water, then rose and flew to the shore. It’s a fairly
safe thing to say that it flew from Toorbul Point, a
distance of 10 miles or more, and probably had
more rests on the water than one. Has anyone else
ever seen Jack do this duck act?
“Tarago” : Reeeiit pars, about the taming
influence of kiddies recalls that recently, while on a
visit to a friend, I was horrified to see the daughter
of the house, aged 4, hanging on to the tail of an
unbroken colt in the paddock. The animal had its
head well up and ears back. I called quietly to the
child to come and get a lolly. The youngster released
her hold and dropped on the ground in a sitting posi-
tion, then scrambled up by way of the colt’s hind legs.
I saw the ears go a little flatter and the white of the
eye gleam, and held my breath; but beyond that the
AN ADDITION TO THE NAVY.
JACK: “ There she is orright. Why, there's two of 'er;
wot d’yer think o' that!”
JOHN : “ Wonnerful! Muster built 'er a sister ship while
we've been ashore.”
prad never moved. After listening patiently to my
caution the little offender lisped: “But I’se oney
swingin’ on ’e’s ’andle.”
“The Elder Son” : Re “L.36’s” score of 37
kangaroos inside two hours (B. 10/5/’23). In 1902,
near the Lachlan (N.S.W.), I sat with the late Jack
Marsh —not the abo. but the one of cricketing fame —
from late afternoon until 8.30 p.m. His tally with a
.44 Winchester for the time was 73 ’roos from 75
shots. One day in the same year he and I were
walking down into a gully when seven ’roos started
up the opposite slope. Marsh dropped on one knee,
and, without moving the sliding sight, toppled over
six of them, and missed the last as it was disappear-
ing into some pine scrub. This man was the best bush
shot, with all classes of guns, I have ever seen. Blood
poison, after having a tooth drawn, signed his scoring-
card at Cowra in 1903.
* * # *
“Jim Carew”: As a snack an alligator
prefers a dog above anything else, and I saw one refuse
to touch a calf because he thought that by so doing
he would manage to get a dog. I was taking some
stud cattle from one N. Queensland station to another,
and after crossing a river stopped for a rest in the
shade right on the bank. A six-months-old calf
strolled back into the water, and even when I started
the others he refused to come out. 1 tried to send my
dog in after him, but for the first time in his life the
dog refused duty ; and when I dismounted, intending
to throw him in, he bolted. Then the calf suddenly
decided to come out of his own accord, and while
watching him leave the water I saw a big alligator
swim slowly upstream.
* * * *
“Biltong”: No one seems to have an ex-
planation handy as to why a bullock has longer
horns than a bull, and a wether is minus the big
curly horns of a ram (“Two Blacks,” B. 17/5/’23).
Anyone I’ve heard discuss it merely makes the
obvious remark that castration is responsible, the
bullocks becoming more like the cow and the
wether more like the ewe; but why does the
operation which promotes the growth of horn in
the one animal actually retard the same process in
the other? Also, why doesn’t a spayed cow develop
bull-like horns and a ewe similarly operated upon
acquire the eurly-wurly head decoration of the ram?
* * * *
“Quang”: Herewith a belated explana-
tion of why springs rise in drought time (B.
12/4/’23). During these periods barometric pressures
are abnormally high over long periods; hence the
pressure against the underground current is lessened,
the moisture rises and commences to flow. Later a
long period of low pressures arrives bringing heavy
rains, and the flow diminishes or ceases altogether.
* * * *
“Ringer”: “Jim Carew’s” female shearer
(B. 26/4/’23) reminds me of two sisters who ran a
selection out towards Alice Springs (S.A.). Besides
being good shearers, they broke in all their own horses,
branded cattle and marked lambs—in fact, their old
man, who had country near by. told the Adelaide
Observer, in an interview, that his daughters were as
good as any bushnien at any old kind of work. They
once brought a mob of fats into Oodr.adatta, with
the assistance of two gins,
. * » •
“Jimmy Possum”: Recent pars re
feathered alarmists remind me that when 1 was
kangaroo-shooting on the 13ananaland
coast in 1902-03 the birds I cursed
most were the sulphur-crested (white)
cockatoo and the crow. As sure as a
patch of ’roos was struck in grass-
tree or casuarine country up would
tiy a flock of the noisy white corn-
thieves, and away would go the
bounders. It seemed to me they had
formed a compact with the ’roos for
mutual benefit, for where the birds
were found the others would not be
far away. Crows, on the other hand,
would fly on ahead and alight on a
trcei beneath which the ’roos were
camping. A few low caws, and in-
stantly the whole mob would be on
the alert, and by the time I sighted
them would usually be in full flight.
I have never been able satisfactorily
to decide whether the scavengers were
taking sides with me or the ’roos. It
meant a gorge for them when I
dropped a hopper, and 1 am inclined
to think the black devils knew it.
•» * *
“Rabbit”: Two rabbiters in
the backblocks near Mossburn (M.L.)
had a Chow cook who died on their
hands. The nearest policeman was
at Lumsden, 40 miles away, and BilJ
Simpson, one of the rabbiters, called
him up on a station telephone and
aSked for instructions. “Pack him
in here for an inquest” was the reply.
This was a three-days’ job, but Bill
couldn’t dodge it, so he loaded up
the Chow across a packhorse and set
out for Lumsden. He arrived late at
night, knocked up the cop, and said,
“Here’s your damned Chow. Lay hold
of him—l’ve had enough of the
blighter.” As the John Hop lifted
the corpse from the horse he re-
marked : “He’s pretty light for his
size.” “Too true,” said Bill, “we
gutted him.”
“Zamilc”: “W.D.G.” (B. 17/5/’23) tilts
at “Huffln-Guflin” for deploring the lack of shade-trees
tor sheep, and instances jumbucks ignoring the shade
on Western (N.S.W.) stations. They do; but not
because they don’t like it. The natural camping-place
for sheep during the heat of the day is in the shade,
but out on the broiling, plain they get more or less
immunity from the blowfly. Old hands out back fre-
quently remark the almost invariable camping of sheep
in the sun nowadays, and allege that it wasn’t so
when blowflies were scarcely known. The maggot-
dispensers stand heat a good deal better than they do
cold, but even they jib a little at the heavy sun tem-
peratures of the plains out west, whereas they
are nimble enough in the shade upon the hottest
day. But constant bleaching in the sun make*
the wool harsh and dry and the tip “fuzzy” and open
WHAT YOU MIGHT GALL A SIDE-
LINE.
PIANO TUNER: “ I’ve called to tune the
piano.”
WOMAN OF THE HOUSE: “I never asked you
to tune my piano.”
PIANO TUNER “No; but the man next door
did”
to collect dust. So even if he has to sit and pick his
teeth in the shade the buzzer is putting in deadly work
indirectly just the same.

“V. J.C.”: Yes, queer accidents are still
happening. The other day a man at Goulburn
(N.S.W.) was catching a horse, when his dog charged
from the rear and got his teeth caught in the prad’s
tail. The horse swung round, and Rover went flying
through space, catching the man in the face. Result:
a broken nose and a dead dog.

BACK TO BANGALOO.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
You’ve heard of “Back to Ballarat” and “Back to
Bogan’s Gap,”
And back to lots of other parts not marked on any
map;
But, just in case you’ve missed the yarn, I’ll set it
forth for you,
Of a little celebration that they held at Bangaloo.
Now Bangaloo consists of one small drinkery, a store,
A blacksmith’s shop without a roof, and goats and
dogs galore;
Just add a tattered abo. and a browsing cow or two,
And you’ve a mental picture of the town of Bangaloo.
’Twas Hogan organised the stunt that brought the
pilgrims back
On bikes, in drays and sulkies, and with swags along
the track.
It seemed everyone was coming whom the township
ever knew—
They were riding, biking, driving, tramping, back to
Bangaloo.
There were tables set and ready, ’.neath the spread-
ing gum-tree’s shade,
And sundry kegs and cases ’neath the wattles were
arrayed;
A banner, made of calico, from two tall saplings flew,
To tell you you were welcome —welcome back to
Bangaloo !
If chanced three weary swagmen to this out-back
township tramped;
They were tattered, tired and thirsty, and at set of
sun they camped
IVhere a clump of giant dogwoods by the dusty road-
side grew
A space beyond the boundary of the town of Bangaloo.
One was Mulligan the mummer ; years ago he’d made
a name,
When he took the part of ligro in a drama called
“The FLame.’
But, alas! the “flame” soon smouldered, so our
Mulligan withdrew
To play other parts more humble at the back of
Bangaloo.
Now, once before in Bangaloo had Mulligan appeared,
And he still remembered Casey; of the patriarchal
beard;
Casey of the big shillelagh, Casey of the wild hurroo,
Overlord and reigning monarch of the town of
Bangaloo;
But not for kings and dynasties will Father Time be
curbed.
SARCASM.
FOREMAN (to go-slow laborer): “Go on. Don’t be afraid. Lean on the shovel now and
then. If it breaks I’ll pay for it.”
And Casey on the hillside now was lying undis-
turbed.
They’d miss him, sadly miss him, from the great
and grand shivoo
They were holding on the morrow—their famed
“Back to Bangaloo.”
While sadly ruminating on the changes time had
wrought,
A brain-wave came to Mulligan, a grand, inspiring
thought:
Could he resurrect Pat Casey, he and both his
cobbers true
Might fare full well to-morrow at this “Back to
Bangaloo.”
Some greasepaint , (relic of the past) he delved from
out his swag;
An old grey horse supplied I a beard —he blessed that
ancient nag ;
Some wetted match-heads, and the beard a ghostly
radiance threw,
And Casey, from the Great Unknown, was back to
Bangaloo.
Next night spake Hogan from the stump: “To see
yez is a thrate!
There’s but one man we’re wantin’ now t’ make th’
thing complate;
If wishin’, shure, c’d bring him back, t’night he’d
be with you ;
We all wish old Pat Casey back —aye, back to Ban-
galoo ! ”
The bushes parted in the rear, a ghostly form
appeared,
A phosphorescent glow was cast around his flowing
beard ;
A big shillelagh in his hand, he bellowed out:
“Hurroo!
Be japers, thin, ye’ll have yer wish—-I’m back to
Bangaloo!”
Fell consternation came upon the festive scene that
night;
Some bolted wildly for the scrub, and some fell down
with fright;
But, wild with fear, they scrambled up, and down
the road they flew;
The ghost yelled out: “Come back, ye fools—come
back to Bangaloo ! ”
But not for all the spirits that the festive board
contained
Would they come back —the more they ran the
greater pace they gained.
Three thirsty souls sat down that night, and many
corks they drew
To celebrate that great event —back, back to
Bangaloo.
At kookaburra call next morn the local John came
round,
But scores and scores of “dead marines” was all
the loot he found ;
For Casey’s ghost had fled, and left no word of fond
adieu;
And never, never more would he come back to Ban-
galoo.
With bulging swags and aching heads that did not
ease their load,
Three drunken swagmen plodded on, along an old
bush road.
With mueh embellishment, no doubt, they’ll tell the
tale anew
Round future camp-fires to their mates, this tale of
Bangaloo.

Australasian Agents:
GOLLIN h CO. PTY. LTD.
“Ringer”: I didn’t like to call the old
man a liar, because 1 might have got. the sack;
but he showed me a three-year-old colt whose mother
REASONABLE VARIETY.
STATION HAND: “ D’yer want to loaf all the time?"
JACKY : “N o. mine don’t wantcr loaf all time; mine tranter
sleep some time."
was 19 months older. Can any Abo. give me the
dinkum oil as to whether it is possible for a filly
under 20 months to become a mother?
“Yarrum”: Ask any scientist about the
mysterious drying of Lake George (N.S.W.), our big-
gest inland waterhole, and you’ll get little satisfac-
tion. Many years ago I was at Milbank near Bungen-
dore, four miles from the lake, and fluked a remark-
able discovery. Four of us were sitting smoking on
a hillside when Tinham asked: “Any of you blokes
hear something?” We didn’t. “Then,” said he, “I
do, and it's like the rumbling of a big river below.”
We each put an ear to the ground, and were satisfied
it must be a subterranean river of considerable capa-
city. We followed the sound down to the lake,
but couldn’t locate an entrance. I was there
after the lake dried—-when the wholerbed was selected
and farmed —and prospected' fOf the mysterious sub-
terranean sound ; but it was item est. The river had
evidently ceased flowing, and that may have accounted
for the death of the lake. Anyhow, the old pot is
full once more, and the rumbling noise—as of huge
boulders being tossed about —is going strong.
“N’lmporte” : As to the origin of the ex-
pression “So long.” I don't think it is Greek,
Dutch, Latin cr French. Cousin Jacks here (Bendigo)
swear that it is merely a shortening of the good old
Cornish farewell, “Well, boys, I’ll go us Tong, you.”
“D.F.” : If I could put in a belated entry
for the record shout it would be that of an old Van
Diemen’s Land lag known as Brummy, whose exploit
is described by an eye-witness, Richard Burgess, in
the autobiography which he wrote before he was
hanged for his share in the Westland (M.L.) murders.
Brummy had made a hit at the Ballarat diggings, and
early in 1852 he went into the Royal Oak in Mel-
bourne with some other Van Demonians. Someone
shouted for the crowd and put down a £lO note.
“Hasn’t anyone got any money?” snorted Brummy,
lie planked £lBO on the counter and told the land
lord to keep the fizz bubbling till it was cut out.
“Ius”: This ought to be some sort of a
record. A teamster, with a waggon and six horses,
arrived in a village on the G.S.R. (W.A.), got on
the spree, and was ordered out of town. With half-
a-load, and a mould-board plough hitched behind, he
started about sundown. A few miles out a wheel came
off the plough and it was dragged along on the axle.
The team arrived home at daybreak next morning
with the driver sound asleep and the brake hard on.
It had been put on before they left town, and the
team had dragged the skidding waggon and the
plough on three wheels 35 miles over sandy roads.
* * * *
“Riverina”: Funny how names get fast-
ened on some blokes. Years ago a well-known station
cook in Riverina was suddenly ticketed “Poor Blanker
Joe,” and for ever after was known as such. A flood
and a nigger were to blame. Joseph went on one of
his customary benders in a Murray River town, and on
the trip back to the station was trapped by the rising
water. Two days later an abo. arrived at the home-
stead with the news that “that poor blanker .Toe up a
plurry gum-tree down Tonga river bank.” Joseph was
rescued and promptly saddled with the moniker.
* * * *
“Kenbir”: The three little kangaroos in
one pouch, quoted by “W.D.G.” (B. 26/4/’23), was
not all unusual happening. I have made a close study
cf the marsupial, and found that, though there are
never three joeys born of the one
mother, the old lady will very
often adopt the offspring of a de-
parted sister. The orphan, how-
ever, does not suckle, but must
subsist on grass.
* * #
“Condamine”: The old
cabbage-tree hat, made from the
pith of the cabbage-palm, is well
enough known to old hands, but
very few have heard of a still
better lid, and less bother to pre-
pare, made of the inside fibre of
the kurrajong bark. Select a
fairly large tree, with a straight-
grained bark free from knots and
breaks. Cut off the bark in pieces
about two to three feet long.
Starting from the inside, with a pli-
able table-knife strip these pieces
in sections about an inch or so
wide, one layer at a time. (The
thick skin of the tree is com-
posed of succeeding layers of
fibre joined together by a gluti-
nous substance.) After working
about one-third of the distance
towards the outside the bark
ceases to be of much use. Next,
while the fibre is still soft and
damp, scrape off the glutinous
substance by laying a strip across
the knee and pressing with a
knife held at an angle, then pull-
ing the strip under the knife.
Next, divide each strip into smal-
ler even strips a quarter of an
inch wide. (A small instrument
made of pieces of match-box tin
inserted in the end of a pine
stick does this.) Plait in an
eight-strand flat plait, and sew
together. The finished hat is like
a first-class panama, and, no mat-
ter what rolling and bending it
is subjected to, it keeps its shape.
Its only fault is that it soon goes
yellow. If a method of retaining
its first rich color could be found, kurrajong hats
would be unequalled.

“Dave Shep”: May I tell “Jimmy Possum”
(B. 3/5/ 23) my way of making couch grass take
the full count ? Have your paddock well graze*.!
down by the time dry weather arrives; then select
a disc p’ough with a new disc, set to four inches
deep, with as much draught as the dry soil will
hold. Drive straight, so as to thoroughly break and
turn over the land. Let it stand for a couple of
weeks after ploughing, so as to give the sun a
chance to get in his punch ; then get a spading
harrow or Burdekin harrow and give the ploughed
area a thorough tearing up. Go back to the
plough, lower the disc another four inches, and
give the ground a cross-ploughing ; then another once
over with the harrow. There’s nothing to be done
after that except read the Funeral Service. P.S.—I
refuse to hear a word in favor of red Natal grass;
and why did “Jimmy Possum” drop Rhodes grass
out of the argument?
“Sir Spen”: lie the western N.S.W.
binghis’ holy horror of the eel, mentioned by “Jim
Carew” (B. 12/4/’23). On the dad’s Cuttabunda
station, on the Bokhara, a goo'd many years ago, a
number of blacks were fishing, when one of them
AN ALIBI.
“Sate ’ec up township yesterday. Billy."
“An. ded ’ec? S’poase ’ee was too proud to speak to the likes o’
me up there?"

hooked what he termed a debbil-debbil fish. lie
didn’t land it, but let go immediately it came to
the surface, and lapsed into a fit, afterwards declar-
ing that the poison from the fish had run up the
line and into his body. All efforts by the tribe’s
medicine man to extract the poison failed, and it
wasn’t long before the nig. passed out. We all
wondered what sort of creature the stranger could
be; but the mystery was cleared up when one of
the station-hands landed a big eel near the spot a
few r days later.
* * * *
“Kayo King”: Something was said re-
cently about the accurate cutting of meat. Well,
at Clark and Phillips’s bacon factory here in Northam
(W.A.) the other day a discussion arose about the
weight of two sides of a bullock, which had been
cut down the middle by Simmons, the slaughterman.
The latter eventually took on a bet, for drinks, with
the manager that there was not two pounds differ-
ence between the two sides. The meat was weighed,
and the margin was well under a pound—a pretty
good performance, seeing that each half weighed
about 3401 b. The meat-axe manipulator is willing
to bet that way about every bullock he kills.
* * * *
“H..T”: “Cartet's” (P>. 12/4/’23) flying-
foxes on Susan Island in the Clarence River (N.S.W.)
wouldn’t be noticed up here in N.Q, I was recently
off the mouth of the Tullv at about sundown, and
saw them in millions, not thousands. They flew over
in regular streams, about a mile apart, and stretching
as far as could be seen in either direction. I am
told they fly in this manner to the mainland every
evening from the neighboring islands. A few weeks
later while standing on the Cairns wharf, 50 miles -
further down the coast, I saw similar clouds coming
over. It struck me at the time that if they developed
a taste for sugar-cane they'd settle the sugar question
with much thoroughness and promptitude.
“Ray D. L.” : The Abo. Council has dis-
cussed some disastrous cattle stampedes. Here’s one
that wasn’t. During a bang-tail muster on Consuello
station (C.Q.) in 'BB we had about 300 yarded
ready for drafting on the following day. They were
a mixed lot, mostly cows, with yearlings and some
bollocks. About 3 a.m. sudden bellowings and arash
of timber told us they had rushed. At daylight we
went to the yards expecting to find some too injured
to get away ; but to our surprise we found neither
hoof nor horn left behind. They had only carried
a, ay one 10ft. panel, splitting the posts at the mor-
tises. And they were posts—l 4 x 8 round-backs.
When we rcmustered the stampeders we found a few
merely pin-hipped —a pretty lucky let-off.
“Zanthus”: While Australia is over-run
with imported birds and animals, useful and other-
wise, there are very few eases of Australian creatures
gaining a foothold abroad. One outstanding excep-
tion is the black swan in M.L. On Lake Ellesmere
and elsewhere in Canterbury they are in thousands.
The ’possum, too, seems quite inclined to make him-
self at home in Maoriland. Our plants are much
more cosmopolitan. Two of them, the eucalypt and
the wattle, are widely distributed in those parts of
the world with a suitable climate. In fact, lots of
South Africans think that the black wattle is a native
of their country, and there is the same delusion in
U.S.A. about the bluegum.
*■.*.* *
“Harry Stottle”: I don’t know whether
sharks eat colored men, but I do know that some
colored races eat shark. There is a regular market
for fins and tails In
China, and quantities,
in a dried form, reach
there from other
countries. Duting
1921 Hong Kong im-
ported nearly £lOO,OOO
worth. Only £lOOO
worth of this came
from Australia, where
sharks are used chiefly
for speeding up Coogee
surfers. The U.S. A.
contributed nearly TO
times Australia’s quan-
tity, and even Africa
and Central America
sent large quotas. The
shark has other quali-
fications, too. Most of
the world’s supply of
so-called cod-liver oil
is shark-liver oi 1,
manufactured in Nor-
way. Shark’s hide,
varying from an inch
thick to the thinness
of paper, can be turned
into leather for soles,
isuede and uncrack-
able uppers that will
beat the best patent
l.iither. In Seattle
(H.S.A.) boots are
now being made from
shark’s hide, and com-
petent authorities pre-
(iki great things for
the shark trade in
British Columbia. Even
the entrails can be
used; other parts pro-
duce glue, and the
carcase can be turned
into an excellent fer-
tiliser. In fact, every-
thing about the mon-
ster can be utilised
except what a false-teeth foundry would call its
dental impression.
* * * *
“Ooja”: The thin yellow snake with black
head and neck killed in W. A., mentioned by “H.E.R.”
(B. 26/4/’23), seems to answer the description of a
reptile I found to be common in the west of N.S.W.
—round Byrock and Coolabah —-in the ’nineties. It
was known there as the mulga snake. I don’t know
how it got the name—l killed many, but never
noticed that they were particularly partial to mulga
country.
■* * * *
“rat Bushie”: While living on the Mac-
leay River (N.S.W.) we sat a hen, and put a box
over her as protection against night prowlers. I n
the morning she was dead on the nest, and a tiny
hole was bored into her neck just behind the head.
A second hen was set there, and suffered the same
fate. Then a baited rat-trap was set, and a platypus
caught. Do they usually visit fowl-pens, and, as
the box was a fair weight, how did the little
marauder manage to get under and out again? It
had not scraped away the soil
QUANTITY OR QUALITY?
SWAGGIE: “Immygrints pretty common in
these ports. I. suppose?"
COCKY “Not all of 'em; some of ’cm's
decent."
“Werrimee”: The shelled maize cob is a
good rouseabout on the farm. The small end makes
a cork for bottles and water bag, and for plugging
the beer keg. It is also a quick and ready stopper
for mouse-holes in bags of grain. A 3in. or 4in.
length makes a good file handle, it being only
necessary to stick the sharp end of the file into the
pith, and a thick butt, scooped out, with a piece of
thin cane or an elderberry stem inserted, makes a
sweet-smoking pipe. Two cobs held together are
brush and currycomb for the plough horses, and a
handful, dry, are the quickest fire-kindlers out.
BY THE WOLLONDILLY.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
Under the oaks by the river,
Pleasant it is to lie,
Watching the shining water
Gliding in ripples by.
Gifts of the bush it carries—
Leafage and bracken red ;
Flecks and patches of sun-gold
Lie on its shallow bed.
Under the oaks the shadow,
Cool and scented and calm,
Touches the fevered spirit,
Soothes it with healing balm.
While through the noon I loiter,
Lying with out-flung arms,
Heard are the lowing cattle
Back on the valley-farms.
Toned by the spell of distance,
Lowly their lowing falls,
Heard by me and the magpies
Piping their liquid calls!
Smiling the river wanders ;
Caught by its mood 1 ‘mile;
Flotsam of leaf and frondage—
These are my thoughts the while.
Parrots and red rosellas
Pass me with plumes aflame;
Little the river troubles
Whence in the past it came.
Slowly, with blue wings flapping,
Cranes through the noon fly low;
Little the river questions
Whither its waters flow.
Placid and bright it wanders,
Singing by grove and glade;
Enough for it is the present,
Splendid with shine and shade.
Over me sway oak-branches,
Crooning a lullaby ;
Deep in their soothing shadow,
Careless of all, 1 lie.

A WOMAN'S
LETTER
ROGER
GALLET
Perfumes
soaps
Powders
Summer tiuug a more brilliant smile than
ever over her shoulder last Saturday, and its
effulgence enveloped a Rand wick which,
according to the racing calendar, was indulg-
ing in a Winter Meeting. It was a quiet
day in the stands; woman had stayed away
in large quantities, and the lucky one present
was she who stuck to lightweight frocking—
tncolettes, charmeuse and even georgette
were worn with the minimum of discomfort.
Ot course, Egypt was there in colorings and
embroideries—every third woman can easily
imagine herself Queen of old Nile ; give any
suburban matron a colorful lid and some fan-
tastic bead effects to go on with, and she’ll
swear she's the reincarnation of the chief
vamp to the Ptolemies. Velvets and knitted
costumes threaten to be the universal wear
this winter, and for the long, narrowed-to-
tlie-ankle skirt silk velvet is the Heaven-
created medium. One of the prettiest frocks
was of soft blue velour cloth with a hip-to-
shoulder corselet woven of beads in steel and
blue tones; the neck of the froca was cut
round and finished off with a berthe effect
of the blue cloth. One startling creation
consisted of a black satin groundwork, built
in panels of yellow, blue, green and red rib-
bon worked into Egyptian fresco designs—
the whole might have been five ana three-
quarters snipped off the de-luxe trappings
of dear old Tutti.
There were two lots of vice-i’egals to give
joy to an otherwise dull afternoon. The
good-looking Forster couple—she smiling
under an extensive brimmed hat, and other-
wise blue and grey silky frocking—were
accompanied by daughter Mrs. Pitt Rivers,
black-velvet clad. Her State Ex. was like
a pastel study in cloth the shade of a
lightly-done biscuit, to which she added
crfeme-de-menthe millinery that sprouted a
feathery crop. With her was Mrs. Alexander
Gordon in golds and browns. Mrs. Bertie
Watson was one of the Official Stand good-
lookers in sand-toned frocking; the Frank
Osborne lady added a luxurious fur wrap to
yellow cloth frocking, and was black and
neat about her headgear; Mrs. Tony Hor-
dern was another addicted to small-size mil-
linery-—her hat was nigger brown, and was
the .finishing touch to putty Jersey cloth.
Millie Sheldon walked in the newest draped
effect from Paris, carried out in black maro-
cain. Spencer Bruntons were there, and
Knoxes, Mrs. .Pat Kenna in navy tailorings,
the MacCormiclt lady with daughter Alison,
Mrs. Dennis Allen in navy and henna, and
—and the thousands of others who go to make
up a typical Randwick day.
.The grey pall over Monday gave the new
winter models a chance to air themselves.
Browns, mostly golden leaf, were every-
where ; and of this color her State Ex. wore
one of the handsomest outfits. Her tailored
costume was carried out in rich brown cloth
that sported a heavily appliqued design;
and her close-fitting headgear was of velvet
that looked as silken as a pansy. Beige—
the color that fluctuates between stone-grey
and mole —was another established favorite.
Hose of this tone above black shoes helped
some of the smartest footwear of the meet-
ing. Lady Forster was Persian-pussy soft in
her deep blue frocking, which she covered
with a dream coat of Dutch blue velvet that
murmured its final purr in a luxurious grey
fur collar. Daughter Mrs. Pitt Rivers’s
trucking suggested a poplar-leaf in autumn.
Another brown lady was poetess Dorothea
AlacKellar. Macarthur Onslows enhanced
the vice-regal fold during the afternoon; so
did Dorothea Collins, who was a study in
blue and black. Mrs. Sep Levy turned on
one of the most exquisite costumes of the
well-dressed meeting: it was of black cloth,
trimmed with grey fur.
Every kind of suit except a bathing two-
piece was worn at the Masons’ Ball in Syd-
ney Town Hall last week. The Grand Lodge
had done its proudest for its 31st annual
event, and the civic headquarters glittered
with Masonic colors, fully developed fuchsia
electric shades, and dangling baskets giddy
with roses. The double relay of vice-regals,
G.-G. and State, made a dashing entrance
about 9 o’clock under a glittering arch of
steel, to the accompaniment of a fanfare of
trumpets. The young lady who remarked
last year, during the march-past of the
Lodge’s stunning regalia, that dad had left
nothing at home but the dado on the dining-
room wall, observed with a little more
acidity that he was wearing everything
except the tassel of the bathroom blind.
Forster veiled her blue frocking in
tulle, and carried the up-to-the-minute em-
broideries in gold and blue-green chenille
upon the lower deck, while the upper was
finished off with a cape effect of net that
glittered as though it had been caught in a
shower of dew. Dame Margaret w T as dia-
monded at frequent intervals, and more hand-
some jade brocades also, with a lightsome
cape accessory. Amethyst satin, on which a
flock of golden butterflies paused on the
wing, enwrapped the naval Craufurd lady.
The Kelso Kings added dignity to the vice-
regal group—daughter Olive in blue velvet
--and of dancers and lookers-on there were
literally thousands.
The drawing-room and the assembly-room
of the AVomen’s Club were banked with roses
one warm afternoon last week in honor of
Lady Forster, to whom the Victorian League
was holding out the sleekly-gloved hand. The
two big rooms were packed to overflowing with
femininity, but fearless among them stood
a few males, of whom were Henry Braddon
and Archdeacon D’Arcy Irvine. The G.-G.’s
lady turned on her pretty profile under
coque-plumed brown millinery, and was
otherwise dressed in cigar-brown satin and
lace. Mrs. Pitt Rivers bore her company
in a gown and hat of sable hue. The Cullen
lady added mole silk to an afternoon that
looked solidly prosperous rather than giddily
exuberant.
While the rest of us were at work, etc.,
the Gov.-Gen. and Lady Forster and 2998
others bade good-bye to Australia’s Davi3
Cup team at the AVhite City courts last week.
Between tea, cakes and chatter they cheered
the brilliant left-hander, Jack Hawkes, when
he defeated J. O. Anderson pointless in an
exhibition singles match. If smiling can
win the Cup, then Ilawkes, Mclnnes and
Sclilesinger will bring it back; and th'e dread
of many a young Australian miss is that their
hearts may go with their cheeriness. Ander-
son, of course, will comport himself as
befits a man with wife and family at home.
The trippers left with many good wishes and
much luggage by the Makura on Saturday.
At the last Sydney Hospital committee
meeting it was decided to erect some perma-
nent memorial to Herbert Maitland, its
senior surgeon—perhaps “a new wing when
space can be made available, to include,
amongst other things, a suitable out-patients’
department, thus making further provision
for the sick poor of the city.” If his wishes
could be expressed, they would assuredly be
for something in such form.
Soprano Emily Marks, dressed in a shim-
mering glory of golden tissue, with her night-
black hair worn in a graceful sweep from
forehead to the nape of the neck, poured out
her exquisite notes to a crowded King’s Hall
on Friday. It was the piquant little lady’s
first song-burst since her return from Europe
and America; and the Voice has lost none
of the bell-like quality which won from Lon-
don critics such rounds of applause. The
programme wandered through the ages, from
something written by a Chinese poet 705
years b.c. down to a 1922 composition, and
included works of English, French, American
and German composers.

Renee Maxwell took farewell of her Syd-
ney admirers on Saturday evening in the
I*? 11 - T Her . frock, to echo the color of
Ihe Lilac Domino,” which music formed
a large slice of the programme, was of lilac
velvet that cunningly coquetted here and
there with silver lace. Renee’s voice is as
sweetly true as when she first returned to Syd-
ney and D’Alvarez has promised to put her in
the way to conquer America with it. Half-
way through the concert the singer’s accom-
panist and adviser, Natalie Rosenwax. took
things in hand, addressed the audience at
length—a good deal to her own glory—and
recommended contralto Evelyn Hall as a sub-
ject for a benefit concert with the object of
sending her to London to study. When the
concert was ended, and every woman was
feeling for the arms of her top-coat, Natalie
blew’ into the conductor’s signal-box and led
the audience in “Auld Lang Syne.” Ada
Reeve or Melba couldn’t have done it with
more dash.
For the junior Vere de Veres the
dance at the Rose Bay Golf House gave
a finishing touch to Saturday’s races.
The wattle-bowered rooms and wide veran-
dahs were almost entirely given over to bat-
talions of young and as the June
night was summer soft, dancing was carried
on as much in the open air as in the ball-
room. Mrs. Pitt Rivers, who dropped in late,
was a graceful exponent of black satin and
jet; and the same combination clothed Mrs.
Nelson Clover. Fuchsia-toned georgettes
enveloped Airs. Hector Clayton, and old-
rose satin with heavy bead effects was worn
by Mrs. Frank Osborne. Tall Lachlan
Beaton brought his w'ife, who wore one of
the handsomest frocks in the room—it was
of gold tissue and autumn-red lace, with a
few handfuls of flowers blooming on it;
Ruby Adams, who came with her, was in a
froth of gold tissue and lace. Three Shel-
don sisters and the Waley twins came to
the party, on which artist John Longstaff
also shed his light.
Here’s a man who is on speaking terms
with more insects than most of us ever Avant
to have anything at all to do with. Walter
Wilson Froggatt is 05 now—or will be in
a day or two
—a n d he
started keep-
ing winged
things in
empty match-
boxes when he
was seven or
eight. That
was outside
Eaglehawk, on
Bendigo, where
his fa the r
managed a
mine. When
he went drov-
ing he still
kept more
than half an
eye for buzz-
in g things;
and he pur-
sued the wily
beetle from
Milparinka to
Cape York, and generally caught it. Then
the duly earmarked scientists caught him,
and through Baron von Mueller he was ap-
pointed entomologist to the exploring expedi-
tion which the Geographical Societies sent
to New Guinea. That was in 1885, and he
has been an entomologist ever since—first
for the Macleay Museum, then for the Tech-
nological Museum, and for 27 years past for
the N.S.W. Government. At the invitation
of various bodies he has travelled over nearly
every part of Australia and many of the
Pacific Islands, and the work he has done
to circumvent his little friends, who seem
to be always ready to do mischief, is as
colossal as his modesty. >. Of course, being
65, he has to retire from the State’s service
now. Government being a wonderful man-
made institution which reckons that only a
person physically capable of quelling a push
riot can be trusted to properly consider the
ways of a caterpillar.
Lady Forster has enrolled another ardent
admirer. He is singer Walter Kirby. At
the tenor’s last concert the vice-regal party,
which had arrived a little before the time
specified, was left for a whole half-second
waiting for the reception committee to usher
it to its seats. Then somebody hurried for-
ward, murmured the usual greeting, produced
the usual posy; and the party from Admi-
ralty House seated itself. But a press ever
vigilant in defence of Empire scented in
the incident something close to a Guy
Fawkes plot, and next day heavily rebuked
the concert management. Whereupon nice-
mannered Captain Lawrence hurriedly
’phoned Lady Forster’s distress over the com-
ments, and next day the singer received a
charming note from the vice-reine express-
ing her delight with everything connected
with the recital.
The concert given by the Sistine Soloists
on Saturday will drop about £3OO into the
hat extended for St. Vincent’s nursing
novitiate. The Italians were in top form,
and the audience, which was heavily banked
with college students, purred with delight—
the shimmy-shake effect after a particularly
high and passion-freighted note almost hyp-
notised the convent lasses. Mrs. Victor Con-
rick, Marie Segur and Gertrude Concannon
supplied the programme with female inter-
est; and for some obscure reason eacu of
the Australian songbirds poured out grand-
opera arias. Young brigands sold sweets
and programmes.
The League of Nations, which is to bring
peace and goodwill to a warring world is
at the moment responsible for some high
tempeiatures in Sydney, So far there are
four women nominees for the job of repre-
senting Mrs. and Miss Australia at the next
conference: Mrs. Holman, Miss Preston-
Stanley, Mrs. Dale and Mrs. Laverty. Mrs.
Laverty doesn’t violently mind who goes; but
the other three are keen starters for the Swiss
city where watches are made and time is
never forgotten.
The Outpost Kindergarten at Pyrmont
will receive a comforting cheque from a
dance held at the Cavalier last week. Mrs.
England, who helped to establish this oasis
for children amid a desert of warehouses and
factories, is the mainspring of these dances,
which will happen every few weeks for the
same cause. The restaurant management
deserves a cheer for giving the use of its
supper-rooms. The dance was a small and
cheery one, and Captain Gilbert Nobbes was
the favorite partner of an evening abound-
ing in handsome young men.
Mi’s. Philipson, who won the Berwick-on-
Tweed (Eng.) by-election by a large majo-
rity, turns out to be the actress Mabel Rus-
sell, probably identical with the Mabel Rus-
sell who was with the Williamson manage-
ment in Australia and went to England many
years ago. Anyway, she has established a
record as the first actress to get into Parlia-
ment. But her big poll was probably iu part
attributable to the unseating of her husband
on a technicality. Now Melba is talking
about going into politics. She will be a great
campaigner, anyway.
Kitty Merewether, the graceful, dark-eyed
elder daughter of the Fred Merewethers, of
Mulinda, Edgecliff, has engaged herself to
Selwyn Miller, who is a son of General
Miller, and has a station home near Wagga.
Bride-to-be is still in her teens. Her mother
is one of the good-looking Gores, two of
whom married Merewethers, and another a
son of Albert Gould.
Philoinena Mallon, of Berrigan, is calling
her left hand to witness that she has given
her promise to Major Young H. Walker,
M.C., late of the Bth Light Horse, of Yam-
boola, Canowindra.
G. R. W. -McDonald, M.L.C., who made
something of a combustion a Labor mem-
ber in his youth, and was later regarded by
his friends as a confirmed bachelor, has now
upset their calculations by persuading pretfy
May Dezarnaulds, a daughter of a late Count
—the widow is now of Double Bay—to be-
come Mrs. McDonald at an early date.
Bridegroom-to-be lives at Bellevue Hill, but
left Sydney last week on a business trip to
New Caledonia. In these days his business
interests are wide. Yet it is barely 20 years
since he threw down his pen in the Justice
Department for the last time, and set out
to make the world his oyster.
Ursula Stevenson and Philip Smyth King
were married one recent day at St. Martin’s,
Killara, by Padre Charlton and L. J. McDon-
ald. The bridegroom, his father and brother,
the bride’s father, grandfather and brother
and two of the groomsmen are or were of
the legal profession, and the guest-list was
thickly strewn with the law, from judges to
the very latest and least-learned of articled
clerks. The stalwart bridegroom, who
possesses brawn as well as brain, and over-
tops his bride by a foot or so, lately termin-
ated _ a brilliant uni. career in the family
specialty with first-class honors and the
coveted gold medal. Killara will be the
nesting spot of the honors and the wedding-
presents of the new husband and wife.
The third annual supper-dance in aid of
St. Joseph’s Hospital, Auburn, is to be held
at the Wentworth on August 14.
A Brisbane postscript:—
Our non-stop Ex. made a lightning tour of
Brisbane the other day at the request of various
theatrical managers, and put in an appearance at
several shows. Among other things he heard Moisei-
witsch play, saw Mdlle. Terpsichore dance, and
listened to one of Louise Mack’s Travelogues.
Sir Matt, took supper at the newly-opened Troca-
dero, where there were 3000 dancers and many
hundreds of onlookers. All the takings went to
the Children s Hospital. Mayor Faulkner declared
the dance hall open, and Benno Moiseiwitsch came
with the local peerage.
E. H. Macartney’s spouse poured tea for Benno
Moiseiwitsch • and hundreds of guests in Paling’s
salon the other afternoon in an amethyst gabardine
set off with a black-satin hat. Rawdon Blandford
arranged the musical programme, Vera Benson,
Hayden Beck, Arthur Aldridge and Percy Mackay
supplying the items.
the Royal Automobile Club, like Moses, went up
the mountain the other night, and, the moon being
obligingly full, they jazzed in the new pavilion
on the top of One Tree Hill.
The Lyceum Club did itself proud to welcome
Margaret Dale. Freda Bage spoke a piece of wel-
come against a background of roses.
Sir Matt, is off to the North again, one of his
objectives this time being E. D. White’s station,
Bluff Downs, where two well-known racehorses,
Freshman and Marcus, were bred.
Brisbane is to have its own repertory theatre at
last, Walter Hunt and Eve Warhurst being the
daring producers.
A whole week is being given over to festivals,
to aid the Sick Children’s Hospital. Seats for thb
big theatrical benefit were auctioned in the Empire
theatre the other day, and the Great Event is billed
for the Bth.

The Rooms
The State Parliamentary farewell to the
Arthur Stanley pair simmered pleasantly
in the Queen’s Hall, which was palmed and
flagged for the event. There were just
enough State politicians and their women-
folk to give the function a political
flavor. There might have been more
country members if railway tickets for tne
family had been put in the envelope with
the invitation cards. Anyhow, the weather
had been very boisterous, and the Stanleys,
who were the principal guests, are no longer
a draw. And a few members stayed away
deliberately because they had heard that
S’rathur’s reference to Australian Parlia-
mentarians in a recent after-dinner speech
had been more candid than candied. Electric
lights blazed “God Speed” from the end wall
decorations as her ex-Ex. blew through the
doorway; but S’Arthur failed to materialise
until the curtain had fallen on the reception
act. The lady had roped her slim body in
massive pearl chains above black satin hang-
ings, hitched to the shoulders with narrower
chains; but she cutely dodged the chills
with a mustard-colored dressing-jacket
having a comfy white-fur lining. Acting-
Premier McPherson hosted with his wife,
who sported gold and silver embroideries on
her black tulle dress. A number of political
importants lined up on the stage, wi«.h one
or two of their lesser halves and Arehbish.
and Mrs. Lees at the rear end. The Peacock
dame, convoyed by her laughing hubby, was
in black, resembling a dusky waterfall. Attor-
ney-General Robinson’s wife dared the chill-
some night in what looked like a rucked bolster
of white brocade casually secured by am-
ethyst shoplder straps. General John Monash
illuminated the room with his war decora-
tions, but the White and Chauvel warriors
omitted theirs. Evelyn Scotney was a most
spectacular circumstance in cloth of silver
shaded with mauve and wearing a crown of
diamonds on her brown thatch. Mrs.
Lauchie Mackinnon mounted an ermine scarf
over her vivid blue silk ; the Henry Weedon
widow had cast her black trappings for
mauve effects; Mrs. W. Baillieu was in
black velvet, and Prof. Lyle’s wife lit up a
black dress with crystal beads. Monty Grover
and John Sandes were there, smiling sun-
ningly; Mrs. Monty smiled, too, in mauve
chiffonery.
Innumerable disappointed suitors will be
grieved to learn that Esther. Paterson was
married the other day to George Gill, a young
English sailorman who has found a berth
in the Melbourne office of the Common-
wealth Line. The innate modesty of the
artist-bride forbade any wide broadcasting
of the affair, so she answered the usual ques-
tions before a limited audience of relations
and a few close friends. The pair are now
understood to be honeymooning in a cosy
nest on the Dividing Range.
Bush Nurse Dorothy Allmond’s name is in
everybody’s mouth this week. Three years
ago the Anglican Bishop of Gippsland in-
duced her to come from London, where she
bad a comfortable job in a hospital, and she
has proved herself a jewel. The spirit of
the bush has taken possession of her. To
skill she adds resource and pluck, and the
people of her territory, knowing her, stand
by her wonderfully. At her command eight
sturdy settlers regarded it as all in the
day’s work to carry a sick woman on a
stretcher over 16 miles of the roughest East
Gippsland country in bleak winter weather
to the high road to meet a doctor who had
been summoned from Orbost. She herself
rode 16 miles to do the organising, and then
attended the patient during the long trek.
The sick woman’s life was saved, and that
was sufficient reward for the party. Doro-
thy Allmond has found her work. Go back
to London? Not she. Desert men and
women with hearts as big as the Province
that holds them? Not much!
Col. George Stevenson had a C.M.G.
Order and a regiment of medals wandering
across his khaki chest the other day when
he bestowed himself and all his worldly goods
on Claire Dennis, younger daughter of the
late squatter Dennis, of Goon station
(N.S.W.). The bride, who tripped up the
South Yarra Christ Church aisle on the
arm of her brother Seymour, had white
marocain folds clasped with brilliants on
one side and a backwash of a stouter satin.
Her Honiton lace veil had been lent by Mrs.
Russell Clarke. Estelle Dennis attended
auntie Claire in blush-pink silk, with pink
leaves binding the locks that flowed from
under a tulle cap. Major Russell Manton,
in the panoply of war, had charge of the
bridegroom. The Seymour Dennis pair
spread cake and fizz at Arcoona, their South
Yarra home, for relatives and chosen friends
only, and afterwards the newly-weds started
out to honeymoon in Sydney and Queens-
land sunshine.
A loud wail comes from one of our smart-
est wimmen’s clubs, where the gilt-edged
committee has decided to lift the yearly sub-
scription, which means that lots of original
members will be pushed out, and in time the
club will lose its superior tone and become
merely the haunt of the most moneyed.
The elder unmarried daughters of Westra-
lian knight Henry Parker are joining the
overflowing ranks of business women as
specialists in babies’ wardrobes, and all the
best mothers have threatened to load them
with orders. Women who earn their daily
crust needling infants’ muslins and laces
will welcome the news with enthusiasm. One
of the Parker sisters is a good-looker with a
fine singing voice. She landed back last
year from a plunge in the Anglo-Indian
social bath. Quite a lot of women in our
best circles are in business nowadays—f’rin-
•stance, the O’Loghlen sisters, the Grey and
Stevenson sisters and a Cochran cousin, Mrs.
Fred Tatham, the Robertson sisters, and, oh,
lots of others. Our ex-Chief Justice’s third
daughter, Mrs. Lesley Madden Nelkin, made
a little nest-egg out of a crepe-de-Chine
undies venture before she married.
Mardi Syme, the Geoffrey Symes’ eldest
chick, has announced her engagement to ex-
Naval Captain Haggard, who once gert. •
helped on the staff of Gov. StradbroA*.
Mardi, whose christened name is Margaret,
is a dark-eyed, vivacious little thing, and one
of the best-liked girls in her set. Sister
Hilary, her junior by a year or so, is in the
Cold Country with her maternal grand-
parents and some uncles and aunts who are
younger than herself.
Staniforth Smith, who gets the coveted
medal of the exclusive Geographical Society,
had his appetite for Papuan exploration
whetted in the infancy of the Commonwealth
Parliament, when he took- an early oppor-
tunity to charter an old yawl and man it
with a scratch crew at Thirsty Island, and
start to make the acquaintance of the real
New Guinea. He told some weird stories
of that voyage, and his uncertain reception
by doubting natives. He seems to have
escaped the boiling-pot in spite of the fact
that some dusky belles pinched him and
found him appetising. Hailing from Mel-
bourne, Smith told friends of his Dalgety
and ’Varsity days how he arrived in West-
ralia the proud possessor of half-a-crown
and an old push-bike, which he rode from
Southern Cross to Coolgardie. He did some
digging before he joined Reuters; then came
a goldfields mayoralty and, later, a seat in
the Federal Parliament. His wanderings
in Papua weaned him from politics, and
earned him a hearing before the Geographi-
cal Society some years ago. Now its medal
nestles upon his ample chest.
This is a Rembrandt photo of Mrs. Bob
Staughton, one of Melbourne’s most energeti-
cally philanthropic matrons and a headlight
of the Victoria League; which is now making
a big push to
regain its pre-
wa r finan-
cial footing.
(Among its
many - sided
activities, by
the way, the
League tries to
keep the Way-
backs supplied
with books,
and for that
alone deserves
many bless-
i n g s.) Mrs.
Bob is also a
live wire at
the South
Yarra end of
the Children’s
Hospital Auxi-
liary and in
various other
charitable en-
deavors. Her aptitude for organisation and
her readiness to shoulder work and respon-
sibilities have landed her on many a com-
mittee list. She is English born, but was
reared in Canada, then came to Australia
and tied up with one of the squatting Staugh-
ton clan. Her flapper chick, Millicent, is
now preparing to give mother a hand in her
philanthropic activities.
Treasurer McPherson was playing host at
a private dinner at his house at Haw-Haw-
thorn when news arrived of his knighthood.
Fellow-Cabineteers and S’Arthur Stanley
were the guests, and there was, of course,
an extra toast. Whatever value there is in
the thing McPherson has earned the decora-
tion better than four-fifths of those who
have got ribbons and stars in the last 15
years. Still something of a Radical, Pre-
mier Lawson, wouldn’t take any bauble
himself.
The Mewton Choir warbled its swan song
at the Melbourne Town Hall the other night,
when the pathetic farewell note sizzled deli-
cately through all the choral numbers. Dur-
ing the evening there were several presenta-
tions to the departing leader, who is cross-
ing the Murray to take charge of the organ
at St. Andrew’s, Sydney. When the show
was over Mewton bade his friends good-
bye in the foyer, and everyone felt the
tragedy of such a well-trained vocal band
being lost for want of a leader.
This is how Ermyntrude Avery looked in
the face of Rembrandt’s camera. She is the
".lever little
Kew girl, erst-
while pupil of
Edward Goli,
who has struck
success in
every suburb
with her story-
concerts for
children. She
is the only
daughter of
D. Avery, one
of our big
chemical - re-
search guns,
and his liter-
ary wife, who
wields the
hon. sec.’s pen
of the Home
Reading
Uni on. The
lass first got
the idea of
combining music and story—and, inciden-
tally, learning and pleasure—when teaching
R class of small tots at Winning-ton school,
Ringwood ; and now the grown-ups who con-
voy groups of joyous youth to her concerts
enjoy them just as much as the kiddies do.
After 36 years as reporter, acting-leader of
staff, leader- and sketch-writer Dave Maling
has left the Argus office to seek that slip-
pered ease to which approach to three score
and ten entitles him. Steeped in the tradi-
tions of the Tory journal, he (with or with-
out consultation) voiced its sentiments so
precisely that it was difficult to say whether
the Argus was Maling or Maling the Argus.
But the real Maling was best seen in his
“Among the Members” weekly notes during
the Parliamentary session—first the State
and then the Federal. “Timotheus”
(Howard Willoughby) in his “Above the
Speaker” was so interesting and so gripping
that there was a doubt whether his successor
would ever get as strong a hold on readers;
but Maling outclassed him. Master of a
rich vein of humor, he worked it judiciously,
and it never petered out. When his friends
gather in a week or two to wish him joy in
retirement it should be a night to remember.
The little Stanley lady, who always had
a friendly word for feminine Inky Way-
farers when S’Arthur ruled at Stonington,
was called in by the old brigade for a parting
chat over the Lyceum Club teacups on Fri-
day afternoon. A few of the newest scribes
were asked to join in the pekoe. The lady
wore her friendliest smile under a hat-brim
of amber brocade with a feather waving
on the port side. Her natty little black
frock was closed in with a fur-edged coatee.
The 15 hostesses were paired off in turns to
chat with the guest, who honestly looked as
if she was enjoying it. Emily Charlwood
and Bunchie Wheeler, as chief conspirators
in arranging the gathering, shouldered the
reception duties, and the former handed over
a floral trophy in blue and mauve with a
tortoiseshell boomerang significantly beckon-
ing from its northern end.
J. Lemmon, M.L.A. for Williamstown,
who still has hopes of being Minister for
Education in a Labor Government, owes a
lot of his interest in politics to his fine old
mother, who has just finished 50 years’ ser-
vice as caretaker of the Melbourne Trades
Hall. He is probably the most popular man
in the Assembly, and it would need somebody
with a character yet uninvented to replace
him in the affections of his constituents. One
of the still bright spirits in the A.N.A.,
Lemmon declares that his proudest moment
was when he had saved up £5O to nominate
for a seat in the Assembly. He didn’t win,
but his experience decided him to buy an-
other money-box and start building up a
fresh 50.
The David Hennessy girls asked a whole
battalion of young things to come along and
fox-trot in the parental top flat at White
Lodge, where they live over the Everard
Browne family. The trio of hostessing sis-
ters fluttered in flower-like frockings, Sylvia
in jade green, Lurline in tender pink, and
little Valerie in primrose. Dr. Kathleen
Daly whirled like a soft little butterfly in
black silk patterened with moonlight beads.
Dad and mum side-tracked the frivol for one
crowded hour of the State Parliamentary
shivoo to the Stanleys.
The South Yarra end of the Children’s
Hospital Auxiliary met in the ballroom of
the president, Mrs. Harry Emmerton, the
other afternoon, and among other things it
was agreed, though not unanimously, that
an auxiliary flower-day should be tried.
After the hon. sec. had pencilled the final
note members cheered themselves with tea
and cream-puffery in the billiard-room. The
Mackey dame, Premier Theodore’s wife
and the Glasgow matron were among
the. visitors. As the last cup was
drained Mrs. Emmerton turned on some
musical moments, with Miss Dallas Fraser
handling the ’cello, and Mrs. Pauli Carter
the piano. Niece Mary Emmerton and little
Dorothy Langlands Jack are the auxiliary’s
non. secs., and Edith Poolman looks after its
finances.
While fathers, lay, religious and other-
wise, are making a fuss about Head-of-the-
River races, mothers are lying low. But
their mutterings amount to this: “Why
shouldn’t those of us who are lucky enough
to have boys of good physique and sound
limb allow all the other mothers and sisters
to admire them? The more the better!” So
that’s that.
When Mrs. Ellen Miller died the other
day, Launceston lost its oldest citizen. In
another 12 days, according to family papers,
she would have been 102. Mrs. Miller
was a Fifesider from Dunfermline, and left
just when they were starting the construc-
tion of the Forth bridge, which brings her
stay in Launceston to about 43 years.
Charles Doherty, who is to figure in
Esson’s “Mother and Son” at St. Peter’s
Hall to-night with the Pioneer Players, has
built up a pretty considerable repertoire of
roles. lie appeared a while back in Esson’s
“The Battler” at the Playhouse, and was
associated with the brilliant Isabel Handley
in Vance Palmer’s dramatic version of Henry
Lawson’s “Telling Mrs. Baker.” In Stewart
Macky’s “John Blake,” which had a three-
nights’ run at the Temperance Hall, Doherty
took over the name-character, which had been
dropped by a specially-engaged pro. through
illness. Formerly he had whetted his young
appetite for problem drama on Galsworthy’s
“Strife” and Ibsen’s “Enemy of the People”
with Gregan McMahon, and the same actor-
manager picked him for a congenial role in
McDonald Hastings’s “New Sin,” the odd
flare of extravagant cynicism which hasn’t
a petticoat in it. And years and years ago
he was a model Parliamentary Whip in
Arthur Adams’s “Mrs. Pretty and the Pre-
mier.”
Cynthia Taylor isn’t going on the stage—■
or, if she is (one can’t tell what a girl may
do in the years unborn), she isn’t rehearsing
for “Tangerine.” Her mother, who three
years ago married the only son of Dr. Roth-
well Adam, assures this Letter on that point.
Lady Forbes Robertson has agreed to play
the part of chief lantern-carrier in the “half-
hour-before-midnight” procession at the
Civil Ambulance Ball, and the “O’Brien
Girl” crowd have promised to look in and
lead the way in the fox-trotting cotillion.
The whole cost of production has been raised
by contributions and otherwise. One cheque
for £lB was thrown in by Athenseum Club
members to pay for the band, which is appa-
rently not giving its services too cheaply.
Adelaide drops a line: —
A committee took over the Palais de Dance the
other evening and gave a subscription ball in aid
of the Babies’ Home at Walkerville. The H. C.
Downer, J. E. Good, H. 0. H. Denton and E. W.
van Senden matrons and Miss E. Barker were among
those who worked to make the show a success, and
their friends brought along parties.
The F. H. Snows’ only son, Wilfred, has made a
Brisbane damsel, daughter of the F. Ewings, pro-
mise to say “I will” at a forthcoming ceremony.
F. J. Mills, one of the pillars of the Cheer-up
Society, has left the Post Office to be State general
see. for the Boy Scouts. In his spare time he lec-
tures and scribbles, as well as lends a hand on
various committees; one of his books brought in a
useful £BOO for the Returned Soldiers’ Assoc.
Under the presidency of Lady Bridges the Victoria
League opened its winter lectures with an address on
the Monroe Doctrine by Mrs. G. C. Henderson, Ph.D.,
who held a professorial job at one of the American
’varsities before her marriage, and has made a
special study of American and British history. She
wound up with a declaration that Uncle Samuel inter-
preted the doctrine to suit himself, “always and
absolutely.”
The estate of the late A. J. Barker has been sworn
at £20,000 and goes to his widow and children,
except four £25 legacies to charities.
The St. Peter’s Collegians’ Association is mourn-
ing the loss of its hon. sec., Arthur Evans, who has
resigned after keeping the minutes for 23 years (he
is a mere infant in office compared with treasurer
Labatt, though, for he has kept the Association’s
accounts for 42 years). Evans was the guest of
honor at the annual smoke social, and came away
the richer by many compliments and two entree
dishes. The work has grown so heavy that the
Assoc, is putting a paid man into his place.
Passed out, Mrs. Lavington Glyde, whose husband
held Ministerial office ’way back in the ’sixties and
’eighties. Her daughter married one of the Moul-
dens, since when her home has been mostly in Eng-
land.
And the death of Miller Anderson leaves a gap
that won’t be easily filled. Like his wife, who died
about three years ago, he chose to live quietly and
do good unostentatiously.
The Governor is planning a trip to the Macdon-
nell Ranges in mid-June, with Premier Barwell,
Railways Commissioner Webb, T. McCallum and
Murray Aunger as others of the party. Prime Minis-
ter Bruce was asked to go, too, but the House meets
two days before the date fixed for the party’s depar-
ture.

The purchase of a Case Tractor, is a sound investment, returning good
interest through years of faithful service. The Case is reliable, cuts down
farm costs to a minimum, and is so constructed, and backed by engineering
service, that replacements can be quickly and cheaply supplied when such
are required.
The Case Radiator—One of many exclusive features of CASE Tractor Construction
This radiator, made in CASE
Workshops, is of the copper
fin and tube, non-clogging type
with a cast-iron frame.
The radiator is made in five
parts, the core being supported
by two cast sides bolted to the
cast upper and lower sections
which act as reservoirs. This
<
r
M
m
makes an absolutely rigid con-
struction, and is the only de-
sign that will withstand the
weaving and vibration that a
Tractor radiator is subjected
to, and removes a source of
considerable trouble resulting
from the use of radiators of
less sturdiness.
The cooling system is of large
capacity and very elective. The
amount of water evaporated in a
day’s operation under ordinary
service conditions is negligible,
and the CASE engine never boils
—just one reason for CASE
Tractor economy.
The CASE Tractor may be run
on the hottest day without trouble
from overheating.
The CASE Tractor radiator may
be taken apart and reassembled
without a soldering iron or any
special tools, and the vertical
copper tubes in case of damage
are readily repaired.
SPARE PARTS ARE
STOCKED BY ALL OUR
BRANCHES.

How Goodyear
builds tubes —
both Red and Grey
GOODYEAR Red and Grey Tubes
are all constructed by the lami-
nated process, that is, built up,
layer on layer, of pure tissue —thin
sheets of rubber, until the proper
thickness is acquired. This eliminates
the possibilities of slow leaks.
Both types have the valve patch
thoroughly vulcanised into the tube —
not just stuck on. Both are doubly
and thoroughly tested before they are
put into service.
Then, to guard the tube on its way to
the user and to protect it after the
consumer receives it, it is packed in a
waterproof and dustproof bag.
Goodyear Red and Grey Tubes will
give you satisfactory and economical
service.
Try one of them next time.
Obtainable from Service Stations and
Dealers everywhere.

Considering the rich prizes handed out by
the A.J.C. for its June jumping events, with which
it was fondly hoped to rival the V.R.C. Nationals,
the class of cattle engaged was rather disappointii g.
there were only 13 starters in the £2OOO Hurdle,
anti seven ot them might as well have been kept in
their stables for all the chance they had. Vic-
toria was represented by Dunwil, who can’t stay ; by
Jlerngan and Amazonia, who can’t jump; by Jewel
bong, who was mud-fat; and by the Beragoon—Lady
Rufus gelding Bigoonbah. The last-named, favorite
at 9 to 2, took part in a spirited finish but failed
by half-a-length to reach Delusion, who had made
most of the running, and the chestnut was the
same distance behind Les Paddington (s’s). The
unsexed son of Paddington—Skopo is a useful bit of
stun, but All Aboard gave him 441 b. and a beating
at Randwick a few months ago, and All Aboard
is no Fiseom or Bright Plume.
OUI H' * n Paddington’s race, and finishing
fast, Plan Robert was backed down to 9 to 4 for
Second Hurdle, and won with his mouth open,
after Bigoonbah had run off when looking danger-
ous. Les Paddington, raised 221 b., was a creditable
second and John Shell a bad third. Clan Robert is
a likely-looking customer, and would have been
more troublesome in Saturday’s race had he been
kept near the leaders instead of being allowed to
labor along among the rear division and set an
impossible task in the straight.
The Victorians annexed both Steeplechases with
Liberate, a lightly-weighted chestnut by Cooltrim—
Liberty and a 2-to-l favorite on each occasion.
In the £750 race on Saturday Liberate cantered in
from the Sydney horses Blue and Guntalk, but in
the two-thousand-pounder he had all his work cut
out to beat old Bright Maid, whose amateur rider
steered an erratic course after landing over the last
jump. Agar, another Victorian, was a decent third.
Liberate is trained by one of the punting Godbvs,
and the other brother landed the £750 Winter
Stakes with Purser (6 to 4) ; albeit if Dialogue’s
apprentice rider had been any use to him in the run
home, Bailie’s outsider would have got there. Sea
Risk, Purser’s little four-year-old brother, won a
£5OO handicap with ease; and Note, their five-year-
old sister, was unlucky to lose a mile race for
novices, in which she was a close second to Stavin-
jay. It is rare for the same sire and dam—Sea
Prince and Paper Money in this case—to produce
three good horses in three years. For the rest,
Toohey rode three winners and two placed horses in
seven tries; and Soorak was twice defeated in second-
rate company. Also, the bookmakers protest as
usual that they had a bad meeting. That may be
true of some of the big operators, but 50 p.c. of
the Randwick fielders are persons who take no risks
and who cumber ground that might be usefully
occupied by a 10s. s.o. tote.
* * * ft
If Tangalooma can’t improve on his re-
cent running it would be a merciful act to pension
him off. Following on his wretched form at Rand-
wick the big Linacre-Auriety gelding was backed
down to 2 to 1 in the w.f.a. King’s Plate at the
fj.T.C. Cup meeting, and finished third last in a
strung-out field of nine. Syce Kifight (7 to 2), re-
turned after a long absence to the land of his birth,
won handily from consistent Fairy Bob and Sarrail.
Another disappointment, for which Linacre was
partly responsible, was Laneffe in the six-furlong
Stradbroke Handicap. His owner tried to persuade
Toohey to take the mount, but Toohey was otherwise
engaged. The race was a cakewalk for the beautiful
St. Anton-Princess Aura filly Lady Aura (4’s), who
was receiving 111 b. from Laneffe and 261 b. from
the Brisbane Thousand winner Admetus. Pike rode
Lady Aura, and Wood was on top of three winners—•
Syce Knight, Washburn in the Welter, and Seremite
(Seremond —Rowlady) in the St. Leger. For that
race the very moderate Sydney performer El Dorado
was a hot favorite, but fifth was the best he could
do. Another well-backed loser was Elpes, and con-
sidering that Elpes ran two great races against Kings-
lot last year, punters ought to have given Seremite
a chance in the Brisbane Cup. But they let him go
out at 50 to 1, only to see him win in a canter
from Warwick Gun and Polardee.
* * * *
The A.R.C. Birthday Cup was a pleasing
race for the surreptitious Tommy Rooks who infest
the Holy City. Dazzled by Benoni’s defeat of Denacre
and King Ingoda at w.f.a., and by gaudy reports
of the much-travelled Skysail’s capabilities, with
Lewis on his back, the majority of punters over-
looked the good form shown by Leaheim and Wynette
in the City Handicap. Ridden by Lewis, Leaheim
was a fast-finishing third to Denacre and the mare
in the City. With Hopwood up, and 121 b. less to
carry, he romped home in the 12-fUrlong event and
returned his backers £lB 15s. for every £1 risked,
The Storm, who lasted long enough to cut Wynette
out of second money, paying £24 ss. for a
place. The winner is a four-year-old bay gelding
by St. Anton —Quoin, and has earned a lot of money
for his owner, A. E. Michael.
Viscount Chaplin, who died the other day
in Eng .and, achieved some fame as a Tory parlia-
mentarian and tariff reformer, but not as much as
he acquired as a young man in the twenties by the
ownership of Hermit, the 50 to 1 outsider that
won the English Derby in 1867. Hermit’s win
practically smashed that splendid spendthrift, the
Marquis of Hastings, who had gone for a recovery
on George Frederick. There was a certain political
justice about the event, seeing that the Marquis
had bolted with Chaplin’s fiancee the day before
the wedding was to take place. Hermit’s victory
(in a snowstorm) effectually ruined the amorous
peer. Chap.in, eyeglassed, big, burly and handsome
and always immaculately clad, had a superaquiline
nose that was the joy of caricaturists, and Phil
May worked the Norfolk squire into many a drawing.
Hastings died in exile and poverty; Chaplin full of
year and honors. Tattersall’s Club wi.l draw the
moral.

“Splinter”: Thumbs Up is the champion
freak jumper of Australia. Tne little chap literally
climbs over the showground sticks. When he takes
off his forefeet are seldom more than a yard from
the foot of the jump, and he rises almost perpendicu-
larly. 1-Ie often uses the rails to help himself over,
and on one occasion I saw him balance on his hind
hoofs on a top rail and come down on the other side
without dislodging a stick. Irish hunters perform
this feat in counties where the walls are topped
with coping-stones, but no visitor from Erin has
seen a jumper with the delicacy of touch that
Thumbs Up possesses.
* * * *
“15-80”: Hawkes’s defeat of Anderson in
Sydney last week is a waning to the Japs and the
Americans that the Australian Davis Cup party will
prove stronger than was originally estimated. The Vic-
torian, who has filled out and acquired more stamina and
speed, did well against the Japs two years ago. He
plays the backline game like his prospective Nip-
ponese opponents, and his service, deviously s.ieed
off a left-handed stroke, has increased in craft and
break-power. It is astonishii g the amount of break
he can get on the ball, and 1‘ m prepared to say
that he is superior to Anderson in thp service
department. Seeing that a well-placed serve is
often a point-winner in the best company, it might
have been thought that Anderson would concentrate
on the improvement of this stroke, but he hasn’t
done much, and his second ball, though better than
when 1 saw it last in Melbourne, invites contemptu-
ous punishment from second-raters. Mtlnnes and
Schlesinger have no service to rave about. How-
ever they will only be spectators in the coming
struggles, barring accidents, of course.

Britain has managed to survive its first
Davis Cup engagement with Belgium. The Birming-
ham-born Lycett, who learned most of his tennis in
Australia, had no difficulty in defeating Watson in
three straight sets, but received a horrible mauling
at the hands of Washer, scoring 8 games to the
Belgian’s 18, perhaps because he was playing on
asphalt instead of on grass. Through Washer
accounting for Gilbert almost as easily as Gilbert
defeated Watson the two countries were level on the
singles matches. It was in the doubles, wherein
Lycett is one of the best in the world, that Britain
earned its right to appear in the second round.
Watson, a Britisher long resident in Brussels, was
the weakest of the crowd, and it shows the state of
Belgian tennis that he was sent over with Washer to
fate the Australians in England last vear. Washer,
however, is one of the first half-dozen hard-court
players in Europe. Johnston, of California, had to
go five sets to beat him in the final of the hard-court
championship in Paris the other day.
Herewith 11.

M.L. Soccer XI, row

18 years since the All

covered N.S.W., and
H.M. was the man who

tour on that occasion.

one of the foundation

Judging by the
form of a team that
is visiting Sydney,
Soccer has made little
progress in 'Victoria
since the war. In a
match against a N. S.
Wales side the Mel-
b •ns shaped fairly
well up to the interval,
but went to pieces
afterwards and were
beaten 5 goals to 1.

best man, and one of N.S.W.’s finest battlers was
Bourke, a youngster having his first game in repre-
sentative football.

South Sydney’s hollow defeat of Newtown
—they scored 7 tries 6 goals to 2 tries 2 goals—
staggered that industrial suburb. True, Newtown
lost the services of Seddon, their star back (injured
ankle), and of skipper Felix Ryan (broken nose), but
before that the South rearguard had run all over
them. The cleverest person in the argument was
ilallett, South s full, who has never played a better
game. In the other matches North Sydney—like
South, still undefeated—beat Glebe, 16 to 5 Eastern
Suburbs outed St. George, 4 to 0, and Western Sub-
urbs accounted for ’Varsity, 19 to 9

“Centurion”: Those misguided Rugby
Leaguers who persist in maintaining that their
professional game is an amateur one received a
shock when the N.S.W. Amateur Athletic Association
warned its members against competing at the Rugby
League sports if they wished to preserve their lily-
white status. The same trouble has arisen in Mel-
bourne University over the proposal to form a
League club in that foundation. Nevertheless the
Sydney Uni. League club clings to the belief that
its members rank as amateurs, and annually applies
in vain for admission to the Uni. Sports Union.
* * * *
"Leaguer” : The Sydney Uni. club that plays
Rugby Teague is homeless, the Sports Union having
denied it the use of the ’Varsity ground for train-
ing purposes. This Sports Union does funny things
In Queensland League is the only Rugbv code played
by the students, and their club is affiliated to the
Q. University Sports Union. But when the Uni. League
XIII came from Queensland last year to contest the
inter-’Varsity fixture, the N.S.W. Sports Union gave
them the cold shoulder. By contrast, the Bananalanders
who won the Uni. boatrace last week were received
with open arms.

This is a picture
of Harry Bosward, one
of the stalwarts of
N.S.W. Rugby Union.

Sydney gave
Maumuiiu the father of
a wal oping fn the
third inter-Uni. test.
cne opening half the
Blues ran up 14 points
1 ’ d "t the <nid
they had 37 (7 tries
7 goals) to 11 (1 try
3 goals). The winners’
strength was in the
three-quarter 1 i n e,
where Nothling and
Foote (two tries each),
Stanley and Callaghan
- i-
land were the better scrummagers, with Miller
and Munro always in the van, and the reliable E.
ti. Diack scored all their points. The result of rl.e
tour is that each side won a match, and the other
was drawn. Which means that the Maorilanders
haven't he-m dhnnssos«ed of the honors they won in
the Dominion last year.

A combined ’Varsity team—seven from Sydney
and eight from M.L.—tackled a strong N.S.W. XV
on Monday, and shaped better than the scores (33
to 19 in N.S.W.’s favor) indicate. In the first
half ’Varsity led by 16-10. Then Raymond, the big
Rhodes scholar, and W. G. George, a small five-
eighth, only 19 years old, rose to the occasion, and
the students were gridnellv mastered, although
they contested every inch of ground.

“Ivirbo’’: Out of commission this season
are Fred Roberts and Billy Wallace, half-back and
full-back respectively of the great All-Black team of
1905-06. For some years the two have selected the
Wellington (M.L.) team, but this year they have
given it best. It’s no sinecure selecting the rep.
team in a town where 30,000 people stood in
drenching rain and a bitingly cold wind, waiting for
hours —five and six in some cases —to see Maoriland
play the Springboks. In the effort to arrive at a
team which could be unanimously declared the pick
of the province 50 players were tried last year.
* * * *
“Past Grammar”: “O.R.’s” par. (B.
31/6/’23) on the centenary of Rugby football is
a reminder that the occasion will be celebrated on
Nov. 1 next, when a combined team of England
and Wales will play Scotland and Ireland on the
historic close at Rugby. The Old Rugbeian Society
is circularising the ends of the earth, with a view
to inducing all Old Boys to drop their affairs and
trek for the spot in time to see the game. Admis-
sion will be by ticket only, and no parents will be
allowed tickets unless they are Old Rugbeians them-
selves. No ladies’ tickets will be issued, save to
Rugby women, so unless the missus hails from
Arnold’s school town, she will have to be left at
home.

The pretty ground at Essendon was none
too large for the 35,000-odd who pushed into it
on Saturday to watch the Same Old play Fitzroy.
Last year’s premiers had just got a clearance through
for Bryant, a big follower from Adelaide, and
perhaps the knowledge heartened them up after the
beating they got from Geelong; or it may have
been the week’s rest —they had the bye Saturday
before. Anyhow, they held their own up to half-
time, and, lasting better after that, ran out winners
by 60 points to 37. It was Essendon’s first defeat
this season. St. Kilda were at home to Melbourne
and felt fairly good up to half-time. After that
the Red Legs persisted in keeping the game open, and
the Saints had no hope, losing finally with 63 points
to Melbourne’s 85. Big McNamara place-kicked
three lovely goals from 60 or 70 yards out, but
after the third the Red Legs saw to it that the
ball didn’t go near him to a great extent.
“Trekle”: Dave McNamara, in 1909, kicked a
ball 84 yards at the St. Kilda Cricket Ground. In
1915, when in his lusty prime, he managed 86 yards
at the Launceston (Tas.) Show. Notwithstanding
his racing interests (he owns the champion pony
Golden Glove), his age (his football career started
in 1905), and several retirements from the game, he
still captains and coaches St. Kilda; .and every
Saturday kicks over long distances. During the
match against Collingwood the starting places of
three mighty efforts were marked, and officials got
to work afterwards with the tape-measure. The first,
kicked into a cross wind that swerved it through the
posts, was 74 yards to the fence over which it had
gone. The second (another goal) had also flown high
over the pickets, but to there had travelled 84 yards.
The last, though probably not the longest, was meas-
urable from end to end, as it began and ended in the
ground. It went 93 yards.
“Winkle”: Odd how faithfully great foot-
ballers turn to beer-pulling when their days on the
(more or less) green sward come to an end. Bert
Flanks (Souths) the greatest all-rounder of his time,
and one of the few big men who could do every-
thing and do it neatly, is a city publican. Billy
Dick, of Carlton, who had only one eye, yet was a
champion half-back or ha it-forward, and a batsman
far above the average; Jim Stewart (Norths and
St. Kilda) ; and Johnny Walker, the large Essendon
ruckman —all are Bungs out Collingwood way.
Flapper Hughes, who played for the Magpies foi-
ls years without losing his smile or doing an unfair
action, dispenses the amber fluid at Fitzroy; and in
the same suburb is a hotel presided over by Ginger
Moffatt, of Richmond’s famous Moifatt-Herbert-Hall
ruck. He retired from the game because of the
storm of hostile press criticism against his new, but
perfectly fair, method of shepherding. Then there
is Silver Caine, the longest kick that ever played for
Victoria. He was half-forward in Carlton’s famous
1908 team. Boromeo, of the present Carlton com-
bination, is a bush Bung. When asked by l the Carl-
ton committee of the capabilities of Maurice Beasy,
a fellow-townsman, he modesty replied: “Everybody
says I’m a champion; well, Beasy’s nearly as good.”
Mick Maguire, the present proprietor of the Bull and
Mouth, Bourke-street, a champion boxer in his time,
was a footballer of merit with Richmond and Mel-
bourne.

Johnny Kilbane, the 34-year-old U.!s.
featherweight, who has held the title since 1912, thanks
chiefly to his prudence in picking his marks, last
it last week to Sydney’s old friend Eugene Criqui.
The battle-scarred Frank did the trick in the sixth
round with his favorite right smash, and a crowd
of 20,000 saw their countryman go down. Only
once before had Johnny taken the count, and that
was when he went out of his class to meet Benny
Leonard. When in Sydney Criqui walked through
all his white opponents; but the Filipino Dencio
might have beaten him had the Manilaman not
had a sudden visitation of the malady which, a few
months later, caused his death. Eugene has been
matched with Johnny Dundee, so called because
his real name is Josef Carrora, or something like
that.

Frank Da Silva, the 6ft. 4in. lightweight
from India, owns an interesting left, and his foot-
work is not to "be despised. Also, in the fourth
round of his scrap with Danny Morgan at Sydney
Stadium, he contrived to bump Daniel’s right eye
with his head, although the Welshman is nine
inches shorter. But among Frank’s possessions is
a glass jaw. Morgan reached it in the seventh with
a snannv right. Then the crowd melted out into
the night.

It is a long time since an easier win was
seen on the Parramatta River than that -of t.he
Brisbane crew in the inter-’Varsity boatrace. Except
lor a few moments when the Queenslanders got
dangerously near the northern shore, the race was
never in doubt. Rowing 32 to the minute the strong
young men from Theodore’s capital were soon in
the lead and, taking things easy over the last half-
mile, they reached Searle’s Monument four lengths
ahead of the light S.A. crew, with the Victorians
third and the Ma Staters a very bad last. Veteran
A. A. Watson coached the solid Bananalanders, who
have been surprisingly successful in these contests.
They were third in 1920, second in 1921, and first
last year, as well as this. Sydney’s showing was
simply execrable. But a blight seems to have settled
on the sport in what used to be the premier rowing
State.

“Pick”: According to “Mirza” (B.
31/5/’23) L. H. Kelly is the only Australian athlete
who has jumped higher than six feet. That may
be so, as certified records stand, but other Australians
have equalled, if they haven’t bettered, the perform-
ance. One is big Jack Ellis, an abo. of the
Wallaga Mission Station, who used to compete
regularly at South Coast (N.S.W.) athletic meetings.
Jack was two yards tall in his bare feet, and had
a woolly mop of hair that brought him at least
two inches higher. At any time of asking he would
jump a bar, turn around and jump back, and then
walk erect beneath without touching it.

“Lexite” : Lowry, the M.L. Rhodes scholar,
made 161 for Cambridge against Lancashire in a
match distinguished otherwise by low scoring.
Lowry intends returning to Maoriland. He will re-
ceive a royal welcome from the local cricket afithori-
ties who are full of projects for improving the stan-
dard of the game, including the engagement of
coaches from Australia. They tried that experi-
ment five and twenty years ago, when Albert Trott
was engaged. He struck a particularly wet season
with soggy grounds, and came back disgusted.
“Dunno about cricket,” he said, “but we learned
anv amount about swimmin’l”
* * » *
“Warrawong”: If Australia had had a
cricket XI in Dickens’s day, the novelist would per-
haps have put an Aussie into the Dingley
Dell team. W. L. George, in “Caliban,” refers
to the double hat-trick performed by Jimmy
Matthews (now of Melbourne Norths) against S’Afriea
at Manchester. And the headmaster of Eton, another
English novelist, mentions J. M. Gregory in his “Mr.
Evans.” The hero of this book is a bowler who
wins the match and the girl by clipping J.M.’s fast
ones off his eyebrows to the boundary. G. K. Ches-
terton was also intensely interested in Australian
cricket. At Harefield Hospital he used to listen by
the hour to tales about it.
* * * i *
“Blue-Bar”: Old-time road-cydlist T. C.
Riley bobbed up the other day as an applicant for
a car license. At 56 —he is 70 now—he won a
race from Picton (N.S.W.) to Enfield, beating the
youngsters hollow. Riley was the first man to push
a bike from Sydney to Melbourne inside 100 hours,
finishing with 45 minutes in hand.
* * * *
“Ancient”: T. W. Wills (B. 24/5/’23)
was notable in cricket as well as football. In 1866 he
trained 11 abos. (Rose, Bullocky, Cuzens, Mullagh,
Jellico, Peter, Tarpot, Paddy, Diek-a-Dick, Watty
and Twopenny), and a year later played them in
Sydney against the Albert Club. Wills’s father was
a member of the Leg. Ass., who went to Queensland,
and settled on Cullinlaaringo, where he, his overseer
(Baker), the latter’s two sons and 11 other per-
sons were slaughtered by blacks on Oct. 17, 1861.
T. W. Wills was then in Victoria. He was in all the
first elevens in the ’fifties, and played in all the
intercolonial matches of his time, his forte being
bowling. Of all the men of his day Dick Hewitt,
now in Sydney, is probably the last.
THE SUZANNE SEASON.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]

Again, across the world, the racquets whirl.
The camera snaps. Anon the screen discloses
Quick-darting man and wild.y-leaping girl.
And once again in countless prints we’d scan
Invincible Suzanne.
Across the courts the flannelled Tildens caper,
The Andersons and Mavrogordatos,
Looking' surprisingly alike on paper.
But what is this in flying skirts and hose,
Unique, entrancing? Match for if you can!
Nay, there’s but one Suzanne.
Cochets and Lycetts for contending nations
May fling themselves'heroic’lly about,
But when it comes to scrumptious illustrations
Of swiftly-flashing limbs, they’re counted out.

Dodge Brothers one problem, at present, is
riot how many Touring Cars they can sell, but
how many they can build.
Never was public approval of Dodge Brothers
product more obvious, and never was it more
richly deserved.
Improvements, rarely spoken of but constantly
being made, have brought the car to a state
of perfection which can only be described aa
remarkable, even for Dodge Brothers.
Every part which takes a major strain is
built of chrome vanadium steel. Many more
pieces of alloy steel are used in vital parts
than normal wear requires.

“Hamer”: A worthy addition to the list
of curiously applicable surnames is that of
an inspector of the Canterbury (Sydney)
Council. lie is Mr. Ferrett.
“Feather”: A late entry (it’s from Broome.
W.A.) for the Malaprop Stakes. After
driving with her best boy one afternoon
Jane returned suffering from internal in-
juries and a broken rib. On being asked a
week or so later, her mother replied: ■ “She
is doing very well, but she’s had an awful
time—besides the broken rib she was hurt
maternally.”
The management of Gibbs, Bright and
Co.’s Adelaide branch lias changed hands
after 83 years, H. W. Waterhouse giving
place to .1. D. G. Medley, who was in the
co.’s office first in London and afterwards
in Melbourne. Waterhouse’s predecessor
was Alfred Meeks, who. after digging in in
Sydney, became also chairman of the A.M.I*.
“C.M.” explains an apparent conflict of
evidence this way:—
“Dee” (H. 17/5/ 23) is doubtless right in saying
Bligh didn't land on the eastern coast of Australia.
But the third account of the voyage states thst a
landing was made near the coast, on Restoration
Island. Here the exhausted voyagers stretched their
legs for the first time for 20 days; they stayed two
days, one of which happened to be the anniversary
of the restoration of Charles II.: hence the name
Bligh gave to the place, llow he remembered the
occasion is beyond me.
His trip to the Imperial Forestry Confer-
ence in Canada in July may help to divest
Owen Jones, Vic. Forestry Commission
chairman, of some of liis hitherto unconquer-
able shyness. Peacock, who is Minister for
Forests, counts Jones one of the State’s few
good importations, and has been giving him
a free hand for a couple of years. He used
to be in the Imperial Flying Corps, and
cherishes the notion of having a ranger or
two on the wing in the years to come.
“Aeon” : At a Sydney surfing village there
is a young man for whom I beg your sym-
p itliy. Until last year he was one of the
l.fe-savers, but finding the remuneration in-
adequate iie lightly turned to the undertak-
ing business. He is still an enthusiastic but
unpaid member of a life-saving club; but
lie finds bis two sets of professional instincts
at war with each other, and when tnere is
a job to be done in the surf he is torn b.v
conflicting emotions which will probably drive
him out of the club in the end.
“Bunchytop”: One Marks on the Tweed
River (N.S.W.) recently went after the local
Fruit Association’s reward of £5OOO for a
cure for bunchy-top, the disease which has
played the devil with the bank-balances of
banana-growers in that district (it lias
already, done damage to the extent of a mil-
lion). He undertook with his supposed cure
to keep an area 100 per cent, clean over a
given period. At the end of the term there
was 5 per cent, bunchy. Had he stipulated
95 per cent, he would have collected the roll.
John Keogh, who died the other day, came
from Ireland to Vic. in ’59, when he was
23. Starting in the Law Department, he
climbed to a P.M.’s chair, and, after half-a-
century’s public service, went out on a pen-
sion in 1909. Then the Commonwealth made
him a special magistrate, and lie had another
five years of official life. Marrying the
daughter of John Fitzgerald, a Western Dis-
trict squatter, he got some butter to go along
with his own crust, and help feed a fine
family of two daughters and nine sons.
Some Sydney Labor aldermen, who were
passionate advocates of the Martin-place ex-
tension when there was tacked on to the
scheme a £40,000 or so commission for cer-
tain people, are as cold as a Polar expedi-
tion now that there is no such commish. But
they offered recently to back the idea again
provided the Mayor promised that the land
wouldn’t be sold, but would be municipal
property for ever. As even Lord Mayors
don’t live for ever, “His Lordship” could
only say that the condition was beyond him.
Whereupon hostilities resumed.
“H.N.” : It is. a habit with some Sydney
paragrapliists to compare Theodore disparag-
ingly with the late T. J. Ryan. That is an
error into which no Queensland galleryman
would fall. Actually, Ryan was very lucky
to have had Theodore as liis lieutenant. T.J.’s
success in the sphere of constitutional law
was largely due to the help he got from
McCawley, now Chief Justice, then Crown
Solicitor, and Hugh Macrossan. Further.
Tom got a plenitude of “boost” that is never
lacking in the case of a public man with a
pleasant personality and a fin*- old Irish
name.
“Yardley”: Poor luck attends the occa-
sional pleas that a Board be formed to en-
courage Australian inventors. Amongst my
papers I have a letter from the Minister for
Defence refusing to consider a device of mine
for notifying ships of the proximity of tor-
pedoes, the basis of it being the well-known
scientific fact that sound travels through
water further than through air. The refusal
stated that Japan and America were experi-
menting in the same direction, and Australia
would wait to copy their successes. When
the war had loaf. Great Britain a few hun-
dred ships, a development of the idea
was employed to warn seamen of the
proximity of submarines. Had our Naval
Department given Australian brains a
show the warning might have been found
practicable very much earlier, and many a
ship now at the bottom of the sea would
still be earning money.
Cornelius Crowe, who retired on a pen-
sion from the Melbourne Police Force long
ago, is still troubled by the germ which pre-
vents some natures from accepting the in-
evitable. He has been an agitator for in-
quiries until his agitations have lost ah
value; his rambling revelations of jobbery
and injustice have ceased to count, and his •
pamphlets have acquired a fatal character
for futility. Nevertheless the tremendously
earnest Irishman, with the high type of
handsome face, persists in re-uttering stories
of his wrongs. In attributing his one-tim.
imprisonment for libel to the influence, direc;
or indirect, of the Wren who scandalised
many Catholics by his attentions to the
Archbishop, the complainant may be right;
but in assuming that any reasonable citizen
has branded him as a criminal, Crowe i*
quite wrong. Anyhow, he appears to have
helped “nark” John Wren, whilst spoiling
a good joke, by supplying Dr. Mannix with
a fund of information re the “rise” of his
patron when, according to popular account,
that wire-pulling gentleman had almost suc-
ceeded in obtaining a Papal title for himself.

<J7 IAST, Powerful and Interdependent
is this living industrial age.
In little more than half a century science has
transformed our globe of land and water in-
to one gigantic institution. From the day of
the isolated craftsman to this day of massed
industry, Oxy-Acetylene Welding has made
possible an advance which cannot be visual-
ised because there has been no advance
comparable with it.
Dependent upon coal is nearly every industry
known to man. The use of Oxy-Acetylene
at coal mines is almost universal and to-day
the process is being extensively employed
also in the yards and in the docks.
Coal handling machinery for loading and un-
loading colliers, coal barges and railway trucks
is composed for the most part of heavy units.
This machinery is usually operated to capacity
when shipments are being received or des-
patched and when a breakdown occurs it is
always urgent to effect repairs with the least
possible delay, not only to prevent demurrage
charges, but to make way lor other shipments.'
In such emergencies Oxy-Acetylene plays a most impor-
tant role. Comox (Oxy-Acetylene Welding) is to the coal
industry what coal is to universal progress —a necessity.
The accompanying illustrations are actual photos, of re-
clamations done by Comox Oxy-Acetylene Welding.
In scientific improvement of working conditions and
equipment, Comox has united with industry and marks
it another milestone on the path of the world’s progress.

At Sydney Theatre Royal “Chu Chin
Chow.” the gorgeous masterpiece of the
world’s most massive and imposing actor-
producer-manager, is in the full swing of its
pomp and pageantry. ’Tis a stunt to make
the senses ache; in the circle phrase it takes
the cake; the gods account it “bosker” to
see Abu Hasan, the robber “shayk,” in the
robes that flow, on the boards that quake,
portrayed by the peerless Oscar.
It’s a long lane that has no turning, where-
fore this paper has been steeling its heart
to hear the managerial admission that
“Sally” is in her “last weeks at last” at Her
Majesty’s, Sydney. Nevertheless, it is long
odds that the little lady will see out her half
year’s run before the curtain falls.
If shudder-plays the hair that raise and
thrill the spine are in your line, and shivery
shocks and scary, then you should hie to
Sydney Cri.; you’ll find ’twill fill your ear
and eye—“ The Cat and the Canary.” The
breath-catcher has another fortnight to go.

Reinforcements of average quality that
came into the Sydney Tivoli bill on Satur-
day included Herbert Barton, a Dickens im-
personator, and Nessie Bett and Kath Casey,
“musical melodists.” Ventriloquist David
Poole and his inanimate accomplices also put
in a reappearance. The week-old veterans,
Herschel Henlere, Audrey Knight and the
Campbell boys, however, are not languishing
in the Castlereagh-street attack upon
gloom. Herschel, of the long hair and the
longer memory, whose repertoire runs from
Chopin to the latest nightmare by Cyrus K.
Tinht rn, remains easily tfie headl.ner of a
good show.

. The “Queen of Sheba” is a wild and woolly
silver-screen concoction that looks as though
it will draw crowded houses to Sydney Town
Hall for many nights. A William Fox pro-
duction, it treats of the love pass ges beiw en
Sheba . and Solomon when the lady pinned
on her-best jewelled apron and her longest
train —these and some jewelled breast-plates
form the bulk of the lady’s outfit —to pay
her call. Apparently Solomon’s palace was
a kind of “residential” for roaming queens
and princesses whom the okl royal poet not
only suffered but embraced. • There are
chariot races and plots and wicked princes—
but, to make a long story short, Slieba and
Solomon call, the eheild David.
“QUARANTINE," AT MELBOURNE
KING’S.
Lawrence Grossmith as Tony Blunt: Edwin
Lester as Mackintosh Josephs.
Beautiful Gloria Swanson, whose gowns
are more superb than her histrionics, is “The
Impossible Mrs. Bellew” at the Sydney
Strand. “Impossible” in the eyes of a way-
ward hubby and a few shady relations and
tea-swallowing gossips, Gloria is only saved
from hectic giddiness by a parson’s son.
“Thorns and Orange Blossoms,” at the Ly-
ceum, has nothing to do with the Water
Board. There is a catch in it. The story
really revolves around a Spanish female
singer’s intrusion into the home of a happy
couple. The extra film, “The Danger Point,”
is also greatly concerned over the folly of
husbands who are too busy to keep an eye
on their wives. Mabel Normand is genuinely
funny as “Suzanna,” a Mexican coquette, at
the Rialto. “Smilin’ Through” srill keeps
the Globe interested, and the Crystal Palace
usherettes continue to catch glimpses of
Chaplin’s antics between rushes. Hoyt’s
features “The Dinkum Bloke.” a local film
which combines fair acting with smooth
photography. Arthur Tauchert plays the dad
of the girl who marries into a snobbish fam-
ily. It is a poor conclusion. “Adam’s Rib.”
the Piccadilly’s money-raker, seeks to throw
fresh light on the petticoated sex ; and suc-
ceeds as well as usual.

Despite ail the dramatist’s sly promises
to the contrary, Tony Blunt is still proving
to his partner in “Quarantine,” at Melbourne
King’s, that he is not That Sort of Fellow.
The demonstrat'on of his propriety occurs
after every suggestion for another ending
has been exploited to the fullest, and the
young man emerges from the bedroom en-
tanglement, his lady’s and his own reputa-
tion unsullied, through the intervention of a

is to show the daughter, Blackie, starting
off the aged tune that tinkled an accompani-
ment to her mother’s awful heartbreak 20

The prospects of seeing Maud Fane dangle
a slippered foot from the boom of the s.s.
High Hope brought a crowded house to
the brief revival of “You’re in Love,” at
Melbourne Majesty’s, on Saturday. Maud
was in great form as Georgiana, but her
smiles and blandishments were frittered away
on Cyril Ritchard, whose jerky movements
and consistent garbling of the'English lan-
guage in song are at his time of day unpar-
donable crudities. A touch of freakishness
is visible in the bounding red-nosed spectre
of Aloysjus Wix by W. S. Percy, whereas
Field Fisher’s ancient salt, with the husky
sound of deep-seated mirth issuing from his
beetroot countenance, is hidebound in the
conservatisms of popular low comedy. Jack
Ralph Harker and the piquant
lteita Nugent, clogging briskly on a wooden
mat, furnish the most skilled disturbance in
the show. To-morrow will be Maud Fane’s
absolutely last performance in Australia.
On Saturday Kathlyn Hilliard will be the
attraction in “Mary,” and Eddie and Deeirna
McLean are lending their whirling legs to
the production.

The ghosts will vanish at Melbourne Royal
on Friday, and all other features of “Smif n’
Through” will be put away. Saturday will
see Gertrude Elliott flouncing in as an
Italian prima donna in “Enter, Madame.”
As previously mentioned, “The O’Brien
Girl” retires in favor of “Tangerine” at
Melbourne Princess’s on Saturday. The
200th performance of Miss O’Brien last
night gave Hugh Ward’s supporters another

All good friends of the Pioneer Players

opposite St. Pat.’s Cathedral, to-night to

The new Arabia, which has been invented
by movie producers for the purpose of pro-
viding fresh backgrounds for faded situa-
tions, is getting another boost in “Burning
Sands” at Iluyt's Melbourne house. The
film is a sequel to “The Sheik,” and, like its
predecessor, leaves all female kind with a
feverish pulse, A bust-heaver of great stay-
ing power is "The Impossible Mrs. Bellew,”
wherein a lady has a gay time until God’s
Good Man starts a throb of lawful emotion
in her wayward heart. At the Majestic the
pew-er typist, nobly resisting the naughtiest
means for relieving an invalid brother’s pain,
suffers a weepy resurrection in “Beyond the
Rainbow.” The same house uplifts wives who
own wandering husbands, the stimulating
message being contained in “All’s Fair in
Love.” Movie students are advised to visit
the Melba, where a ghostly “Christian”
almost founders under the red-hot kiss of
Glory Quayle. The reformation of crooks
goes on steadily at the Britannia. “The
Invisible Power” is the latest to reduce the
“habituals” in Sing Sing by one.
About the Dancey Memorial Show:—
Most of the people who bought chances in the
draw for the Dancey Memorial Exhibition at the
Vic. Artists’ Society got little more, and some got
less, than tlicir money’s worth. A few men handed
in contributions which only Charity could prompt
one to accept. Others were very generous—Howard
Ashton conspicuously so. Ashton’s four little pastels,
dainty and effective, were all real prizes for those
who captured them in the gamble. A chalk study
of Diggers on horseback, by Will Dyson, would hot
have been unhonored and unsung in one of his own
exhibitions. Another strikingly good . effort was
“Pinetrees, Japan,” by P. Hurry, and one couldn't
pass H. B. Harrison’s “Autumn” without a second
look. Tom Roberts is to be commended for his
“River Oaks” ; and R. Sturgess had expended thought
and feeling bn “Fisherman’s Bend, Evening.” Other
contributors to the pleasure of the present critic
were Norman Lindsay, Louis McCubbin, M. J.

Black-and-whiters Tom Glover, Finey, Dennis Con-
nelly, Bancks and S. G. Wells also made a good
show, but their generally fresh work was largely
ignored by investors, who showed a preference for
any old tripe in oils or water-colors.

“A Southern Maid” is in its second week
at Adelaide Royal. Gladys Moncrieff is as
artistic as usual, and notably less gloomy
than last year; and Arthur Stigant enjoys
his own jokes as much as the audience does.
Gerardy’s wizardry is filling the Town Hall.
At the Prince of Wales’s, Frank Bradley is
putting some capital acting into a sketch that
hardly demands it, Reg Thornton has an
original ballad about Moonta and its Cor-
uishmen, and the Akabah Arabs (singularly
white and Western, some of them) give a fine
acrobatic turn. Acrobatic, too, are the
Miranos at the Majestic, where the Jim
Gerald co. still furnishes about half of a
bright programme. West’s pictures have the
dd Sardou tragedy, "Theodora,” with lions
and things on the screen which the stage
only talked _ about. Thomas Meighan is
domestically intense at Wondergraph, Harold
Lloyd funny at the Grand, and Bettv Comp-
son her charming self at the York.

From an Adelaide critic:—
The current exhibition of S.A. Society of Arts is
a triumph of the ordinary. Nothing in it specially
takes the attention. The influence of Heysen
and Ashton —the two strongest factors in Adelaide
art is all over it. Good studies of gums are shown
by Roach and Haynes and Mrs. Torr. Some of the
best canvases are very small ones, by John White
and Malcolm Ilelsby, the latter a new name owned
by au Adelaide resident with English experience.
Goodchild’s etchings are as reliable as ever. There
is very little figure-work in the show. Paula Brain
is the only one who attempts flights of fancy, and
her technique is not yet assured. The portraits in
the exhibition are, as usual, remarkable for a hard-
ness of face that surely cannot be universal among
the sitters.
“Lud”: They don’t seem to mind what
title they give to a revue in London. Not.
I admit, that it matters much. The latest
specimen, to be done at the Vaudeville, has
been christened “Rats.” What a gift for
the “gods” if it thuds on the first night!
“Timson” writes from a furniture van:—•
Spring-street, Melbourne, is not what it was. Its
north and south extremities are as placid as for-
merly, but the section between Bourke and Little
Bourke has become a sudden loud advt. of the tire-
less activity of Hugh Ward. If was possible in
other days to take a jug over to the corner pub
without being noted by more than 10 citizens as
dissolute as yourself, and you excited no remark if
your tenth-best suit accompanied you on the jour-
ney. But since Ward came with his army corps
of decorators, upholsterers and what not, and turned
the old Princess’s into something intended for an
Indian durbar or a coronation, the blight of opulent
respectability has descended on the surroundings.
Every day you run into beautifully-dressed chorus
gills, exquisitely ironed-out actors, with socks and
neckties like four jazz bands playing at once, not to
mention immaculate managers, prancing producers,
and all the paraphernalia of a vast and successful
enterprise just feeling its feet. The populous state
of the neighborhood, busy at any time of day—
especially at matinees—has been largely increased
AT SYDNEY TIVOLI.
Audrey Knight, from London, giving her
idea of a swaggie singing “ I'm on the
Rood to Anywhere."
by the fact that Gladys Moncrieff has taken an ad-
joining flat, and may be seen almost any morning
sunning her flock of curls on the balcony. Awed
spectators of this precious rite only have their
attention diverted by the vision of Mamie Watson
or Maud Beatty in still another confection that
strives to confirm the darkest rumors about their
fabulous salaries. At night the excitement grows
more intense. The clatter of hurrying feet about
theatre time and after, combined with the hoots of
motors, the clang of the tram-bells, the yells of
newsboys, and the unmusical recitals of the Salv’-
army, which appears to feel that its industrious
blatancy is being seriously challenged, make a din
which we older habitues cannot bear. But we
know it is futile to curse and tear our whisker®.
The only thing to do is to shift, so I'm moving
next door to the West Melbourne Stadium for a little
peace and quiet.

“Theatre-goer since 1876”: Last time I
was in ’Frisco I met Clay Green, who wrote
“Struck Oil” for J. C. Williamson. He told
me he met J.C. by chance in Los Angeles,
then an orange-growing village of 20,000 in-
habitants, about the time oil was struck
there. Williamson and Maggie Moore were
barnstorming through Southern California,
doing one-night stands and not making too
many “dahlars.” Clay Green offered a play-
let, “The Chinese Question,” to them, and
it became instantly successful, because the
Chow was a political problem in California
j(ist then. After that Clay Green wrote
“Struck Oil” for the Williamsons, who
brought it hither after trying it in the
U.S.A. George Coppin offered J.C.W. £4O
a week salary, only to be refused. Finally
they agreed to divide the takings, which
totalled £lOOO a month for some time.
Maggie Moore made a boom of “Struck Oil”
because, up till then, no play of the kind
nor actress of her type had been seen in
Melbourne. Clay Green told me he had
realised a fortune from the royalties on the
piece, and showed me a draft he had that
day received from his Sydney agent through
some amateur co. having paid tribute.
“Second Murderer” : Apropos the remarks
of “Caesar’s Ghost” on ttie Actors’ Federa-
tion, and his mention of John Cosgrove as
the first member of the defunct Actors’
Union (B. 31/5/’23). It is curious to notice
time’s revenge. The evidence of the late J.
C. Williamson largely contributed to the
deregistration of the Actors’ Union. In the
box J.C W. looked at the list of names of
members, smiled pityingly, and said : “They
may be very estimable citizens, but as actors
——” and he shrugged. It was unfair, but
he won, and the Union was outed. Now
John Cosgrove, the first man on that despised
list, is playing in all the Firm’s principal
theatres with their leading attraction, and
the Firm is paying him to do it. The egre-
gious, tame-pussycat Actors’ Association
which followed the Union, and which at
first ate out of the Firm’s hand, lived to
bite that hand rather savagely. I wonder if
any of the old unionists are still black-
listed? I was the first secretary to the union
in Melbourne, and I never had a look-in with
the Firm again. George Musgrove gave me
work, however, and told me at the time that
I was on the index expur gat orius. His
troubles about that! There was nothing
mean or petty about Muzzy.
“H.K.”: Mention by “Hamfat” (B.
24/5/’23) of canvas theatres recalls that the
first theatrical venture under canvas in Aus-
tralia' crashed badly. It was Signor Dalle
Casse’s Olympic, which opened on a vacant
piece of ground on the south side of Hunter-
street, Sydney, in 1842. Casse was an Italian
acrobat who had come to the colony a year
before, bringing with him two Brazilian girls
as tight-rope dancers and contortionists. The
trio appeared at the old Vie. Theatre for a
short season, but owing to a difference with
the management launched out in the circus
business on their own account, supplement-
ing their acts with a couple of equestrian
turns and two clowns. The result, however,
was a failure, so they tried combining the
drama with the circus, and for this they
altered the auditorium and erected a stage.
Though the canvas theatre had but a short
life it so interfered with the attendance at
the Vic. as to cause the management of the
playhouse to install a tight-rope and add to
the gaiety of Sydney with a brace of clowns.
“Nella”: Of the itinerant tent theatre re-
ferred to by “Hamfat” (B. 24/5/’23), Philip
Lytton was the pioneer, closely followed by
Robert Hollyford (“Dan Barry’s Famous
Dramatic Co.”), Jefferson Tait, Stanley
McKay, “Billy” Carroll, Stephenson and
many others. The idea is rather overdone
the annual showtime. At Cowra
(N.S.W.) I have seen five of them'. Once,
to squelch a hated rival, Lytton had two
theatres going simultaneously in Wagga,
with “Sign of the Cross” in one and
something equally ambitious, in the other.
Half-a-dozen tent shows, with their accom-
panying brass bands, megaphones and rau-
cous spruikers, can transform Bobbra Wobbra
into something like Paddy’s Market on the
spree.
“M. 8.” (Eng.) : No young or youngish
conductor of high-class music at present in
England is more eye-filling than the Austra-
lian Aylmer Buesst, at present head of the
British National Opera Co. He received his
education under Marshall Hall in Mel-
bourne, and only migrated here to widen his
musical knowledge. His reading of the
Wagnerian opera “Parsifal” lifted him to
the highest esteem. His quality as a
musician is scholastic; and his mastery of
both choral and orchestral work has rarely
been reached by men of his age. He has,
moreover, a knack of inspiring those who
come in contact with him. Whether he has
done it himself I don’t know, but I have
repeatedly found myself thinking of him in
connection with the Sydney Conservatorium.
“Nella”: “George Rignold produced most
of the plays [Shakspeare’s]. during his reign
at Sydney Majesty’s,” says “J.F.H.” (B.
3.1/5/’23). Rignold did not. He opened
Her Majesty’s with “Henry V.” on Sept. 10,
ISB7, put up the shutters on Sept. 21,
1895, with Tom Taylor’s “Clancarty,” and in
between mostly juggled bellowdrama. He
had quitted Her Majesty’s when he first did
“Othello,” for instance, and he had done
“The Tempest” and “Romeo and Juliet” be-
fore opening there —he did not act in the
latter play. “The Merry Wives of Wind-
sor,“A Midsummer-night’s Dream,”
“Julius Caesar” anfl “Macbeth” were notable
productions at Her Majesty’s, but that only
makes eight out of the possible 37. On the
other hand, Allan Wilkie has a working
repertoire of 16, with more to follow, and
he has now given more than 700 consecutive
performances of the Bard in Australia, an
unparalleled record. More power to him !
“Caesar’s Ghost”: By the explosion that
killed circusmen Sole and Perry, Blayney
(N.S.W.) has lived up to its reputation as
a luckless town for thespians. Years ago,
when running a theatrical show through the
Ma State’s middle-west, I was urged by the
old hands to dodge the bad-luck centre, and
laughed at their superstitions. But there
was no show: we got there, to find that the
hall had been damaged by fire, and all our
travelling expense went for nothing. Since
then I have known of four shows that have
AN OPTICAL ILLUSION.
THE BOY (in front of a futurist painting ):
“Dad, What made him think it looked
like that?”
been held up by death at the cold place; and
the financial tragedies have been innumer-
able. By the way, Perry (otherwise Eroni)
was a well-known horse-exhibitor at shows
as well as a circus-proprietor. He had been
30 years on the sawdust, and was on the
point of retiring to a farm at Leeton when
Death took a hand.
“First Old Man”: Who says Shakspeare
doesn’t pay? There’s a picture-play being
shown at the present time called “Doubling
for Romeo.” It’s a winner of the first order.
The authors’ names are on the posters. The
announcement runs: “Written by Elmer
Rice, Will Rogers and William Shakspeare.”
But I feel pretty sure the Immortal Bard’s
Yankee collaborators collect the fees.
“Whitebait” : Hugh Ward has the veteran
dresser Joe Stoyle on his salary sheet at
Melbourne Princess’s. Barring the debonair
Alex. Carroll, manager at the Bijou, Stoyle
is the only working relict of the staff of the
previous Princess’s when it opened with
Nellie Stewart in “The Mikado.” Stoyle,
by the way, dressed Federici for his fatal
exit through the trap in “Faust.” Carroll
was a spectator of the affair.
ALL DEPENDS.
THE TRAVELLER: “Don't you think my hus-
band is gloriomly unselfish to send me
abroad to complete my musical studies !”
THE MAID: “I don't know, madam. I have
not heard you sing."
“Fleet-street”: Oscar Asche has been
roasted gently by Lloyd’s Weekly News.
That paper, in an editorial, “Negroes on the
Stage,” accuses hiuj of being the origin of
the trouble that nas lately been exciting
London theatre-land. Says the writer: “I
suppose the fashion began when Oscar Asche,
having made a hit with ‘Kismet,’ followed
it up with a practically all-black production.
Then came the craze for jazz music, which
brought hundreds of black vocalists and in-
strumentalists from America to London.”
The article concludes by deploring the star-
ring of black artists in London programmes.
“It will cause our colonies to regard us with
contempt, and we ourselves will lose caste
ill the black man’s eyes. Moreover, what
social calamities are involved by the associa-
tion on an equality of black men with our
own English girls!”
“Roma”: Droughts have one queer little
effect: they drive the travelling showmen on
to the patches of country w’here there is a
bit of grass and enough water to make cara-
vaning reasonably safe. Roma (Q.), for in-
stance, being in the narrow belt where the
rains haven’t failed, had more side-shows
and cheap-jacks during this Show Week than
it ever saw before ; and the same circum-
stance is noted at other towns where there
is still a bit o’ pickin’ for man and beast.
“Orb”: Mention is made by “Floater” (B.
31/5/’23) of Aubrey Mather, of “Smilin’
Through,” as a King Claudius in “Hamlet.”
There are other Claudiuses now mumming in
Australia. John Cosgrove, qf the Oscar
Asche co., has frequently appeared as Ham-
let’s wily, sensuous uncle. Asche himself
was Claudius to the Hamlet of H. B. Irving
at the Adelphi (Lond.) in 1905. Lily Bray-
ton was the Ophelia.
“Norbell”: Curiously enough a recent
mention of Charles Kenningham by “Caesar’s
Ghost” is followed by a reminiscence of “Old
Timer” (N’York), who says (B. 31/5/’23)
Lean Caron “took a hand in the opening of
the Federal Parliament. He conducted the
orchestra and wrote the music for the ode
that was sung.” The words yvere by Charles
Kenningham and "were sung by our very
own Nellie Stewart.
“Nebuc”: “V.C.” (B. 3/5/’23) is wrong
when he says George Robey succeeded the
late Dan Leno as “King’s Jester”; the post
with all its honor and glory went to Leno’s
Drury-lane confr&re, pantomime-dame Harry
Randall. I don’t know if Randall still has
the job—perhaps now that he has a film-star
in the family George Rex has passed the
cap and bells on to him.
The evil that Ben wrought:—
I blame Ben Fuller for the devastating übiquitous-
ness of Ephraim Boom. Ephraim Boom is our local
pitcher-showman, and was the means of thrilling the
feminine population with “The Shick,” “Keep Off
the Grass Widow” and “The Flapper that Flopped.”
By these and countless other improving exhibitions
he has made tons of money; but until Ben was kay-
beed Boom was quite an unobtrusive character. Since
the three-two-one music-hall acquired a knighthood,
a Great Ambition has dominated Mr. Boom’s life.
In sincere flattery of the well-advertised endowments
that enabled Ben to bag his bauble, there are Boom
Scholarships for Aspiring Infants. There is also a
Boom Scholarship Trust composed (a stroke of genius
this) of parsons and pressmen. Result, miles of
“p"blicity” for Boom, whose homely phiz, beaming
with conscious philanthropy, has become as familiar
to readers of the photographic press as the lineaments
of their favorite pitcher hero. But scholarships are
only one feature of the Boom campaign. When the
Premier returned from London, having floated the
usual quarterly loan, who suggested that he should
be fed by a grateful people? Boom. Who lent the
hall and sat next to the triumphant earbiter ? Boom
again. Who was M.C. at the Government House
tennis-party in aid of the parching AbyssiniansT
Always Boom. Likewise the papers, in which Boom
is an extensive advertiser, obsequiously publish his
views on mixed-bathing, Labor politics, Egyptology,
vers libre and the treatment of red rust in hogs. All
this is having such an effect in the right quarter
that Boom’s enemies are resigned to the belief that
he is about to be made an 0.8. E. But there ia still
a chance that his head will burst before they be-
knight him.
“Second Murderer”: The old penniless,
pitiful “Bohemian” who scratched for a liv-
ing, and who never paid because he was
never “holding,” is as dead as Yorick. He
has had to get work. To-day the mummer
is paid, and, in turn, pays. There are no
pathetic deadbeats on Poverty Point now,
nor is there any Poverty Point, for that
matter. The Orient corner in Melbourne and
the Park-Pitt-streets corner in Sydney are
points no longer. When the rendezvous of
Sydney pros, was at the Theatre Royal
corner, any bushwhacking, fly-by-night “man-
ager” could engage half-a-dozen barnstorm-
ing cos. there any day at noon. He would
have to advertise extensively now in the
“Positions Vacant” to secure a cast for “East
Lynne.” Cuthbert, Howard, Marmaduke
and Stanley have faded away. The pitchers
have done it.
“Crispie”: Every other time I visit a Mel-
bourne vaudeville show the comedian, whether
he be local or imported, annoys me by joking
about Footscray and its smells, and the
audience exasperates me by laughing loudly.
’Scray’s smells are really a proof that it
has taken off its coat and got to work. Their
sources are the many factories in the dis-
trict, among them three artificial manure
and chemical works, tanneries, a soap-fac-
tory, a maize-products treatment works,
rubber mills and so on. It’s a pity Mel-
bourne, Sydney and other cities don’t con-
tain dozens of Footscrays. If they did Aus-
tralia would have no need to borrow millions
of money to burden posterity. For a change,
suppose we give Footscray three cheers next
time it is mentioned.
“Orb”: This Point gossip about Oscar
Wilde’s opinion of his “Salome” re-
recalls Oscar’s remarks to a friend
who had visited him in Paris. “Did you
drop in at my chambers before you left
London?” inquired Oscar. “I did,” was the
reply. “Did you observe whether my lily
was" in flower?” The friend answered that
it was. “How good of it to bloom while
I’m away!” murmured Oscar gently.
“Mancam”: Apropos mummers saying
whatever comes into their heads (B.
3/'5/’23). Qn a crowded first night in Mel-
bourne, at the “Alec,” I had just come off
gasping from a front scene, when Alfred
Dampier calmly sent me on again. “They’re
not quite ready with the next scene, laddie.
Go back and talk to ’em!” It was not un-
usual on first nights, but this time it meant
an impromptu soliloquy of indefinite length.
And I was Geebung, an aboriginal!
“Thersites”: Most of the stock yarns of
Scotch “nearness” are fathered on to Lauder
as a matter of course, but we’ve had other
mummers quite as close-fisted —if he is close-
fisted. When Albert Myers was s.-m. for
George Musgrove’s German Opera co. he was
complimented by one of the big Fritz pot 3
of the show. “To me very _ goot haf you
been,” said the great Wagnerian artist. “I
make it you a bresent —soh!” and with a
flourish he handed his benefactor a
packet of fags. One high-salaried comedian
imported by the Firm mentioned that he
wished to send a birthday present to his
little wife in Shepherd’s Bush. The oblig-
ing house-manager—it was a Sydney house
—rang up a leading firm of jewellers, and a
salesman came along with a bag of costly
baubles. The comedian fingered the glitter-
ing trinkets, and toyed with diamond rings
and flashing tararas. “Er —you see,” he ex-
plained, “I thought of a brooch, you know’.”
“Yes? About what price?” asked the sales-
man. The comedy merchant gulped hard,
and then let himself go. “Price ! Oh —er —
about four-an’-six!”
“Pedro”: Eardley Turner and Louis
Esson, who have been arguing about “well-
made plays” (R.P. 12/4/’23 and 3/5/’23),
evidently need to be told that thte dispute
was settled long ago by Dumas. “Well-made
plays!” roared the great part-coon. “Such
foolishness, this talk about how to make
plays. There are no more tw T o ways of mak-
ing plays than there are of making children!”

in a unique but simple way.
Peps owe their unparalleled success to the
ingenious idea of condensing into the form of
a handy tablet, balsamic pine essences and other
volatile medicaments of inestimable value in
troubles affecting throat, chest or lungs.
When a Peps tablet is divested of its silver
wrapper and slowly dissolved on the tongue, the
POWERFUL MEDICINAL FUMES
given off, are breathed deep into the chest and
lungs. Thus the Peps medicine comes into
immediate contact with vital parts quite beyond
the range of liquid medicine. It is a proved
scientific fact that so-called ‘ cough cures' swal-
lowed into the stomach, can never affect the
chest or lungs except in a very slow and round-
about way.
A,s the Peps medicinal fumes circulate through
all parts of the breathing
system their soothing and
healing influence is
quickly made mani-
fest. Sore, weak
inflamed tissues are
soothed and healed
dangerous disease
germs are destroyed, and chest and lungs are
gradually but wonderfully strengthened.
Be sure and get these breatheable PEPS
tablets and refuse nauseous mixtures containing
opium, morphia, chloral or other dangerous
drugs. Peps contain no harmful drug, but are
so pure and so safe that they can be given even
to the youngest child or frailest invalid with
absolute benefit.
Keep Peps always handy! They are the
most valuable remedy ever discovered for treat-
ment of Coughs, Colds, Night Chills, Throat
Trouble, Bronchitis, Bronchial Asthma, Old
Folks’ Cough, Children’s Chest Weakness, etc.
PEPS are obtainable of all Chemists and Stores
at 1/6 per box, or family size 3/- (containing three
times quantity), or post free at same prices from
C. E. FULFORD ( A/asia), Ltd., Sydney. The
name PEPS is stamped on every tablet.
Dr. Cordon Stablea says:—
Dr. Gordou Stables, in one of his famous books,
says:—“Peps are exceptionally suited for the
treatment of bronchial ailments ; their peculiar
composition, their direct influence on the mem-
branes of the bronchi and their freedom from
risky narcotics being among their many praise-
worthy points. Therefore, if you desire to ease
and end a cold or to loosen tickling phlegm and
clear the throat and breathing tubes, use these
Peps tablets freely."
Serious Chest Complaint.
Mrs. Abbott. Carmalea, Wynnum North,
Brisbane, Q’land, writes
“ Being a great sufferer from Bronchial Asthma,
and at times not able to lie down on account of
the awful choking sei sationsand wheezing on the
chest, I wish to let you know of the wonderful
relief your Peps have p.ven me. When these bad
rttacks are on 1 take two of the Peps, which bring
me quick relief; and arter continuing fora few
doses at short intervals 1 am soon able to lie down
without the suffocating ,'eelings overtaking me.
“ Anyone I come a.ross who is suffering from
colds, or other chest trouble. I recommend Peps
to, and indeed give them one or two to take for
relief, which they ah-ays get quickly.
“ You are quite at liberty to use this testimonial
as you wish, as I think others suffering from
Bronchial Asthma, as I have, or any other chest
trouble, would be pleased to know of Peps. Per-
sonally I would not be without them.’’

What the Right Leather Belting Means
to Your Production Efficiency.
Engineers who have made a study of power transmission problems testify to
the difference in the efficiency of a plant that the right belting can make.
For instance, on a high-speed drive such as that illustrated, it is of the
greatest importance that the belt used should have the maximum of tough-
ness, flexibility and frictional grip.
That is the reason why
Chromol Leather Belting
was selected for the purpose.

Choose Your Light Plant
by its ENGINE.
IN selecting their Electric Light Outfit, many people
overlook the supreme importance of choosing the
plant by the soundness of its heart—the Engine—
they make the mistake of taking a plant of the direct-
coupled type where the engine must be a high-speed unit,
good for little but driving the dynamo, and where utility
is sacrificed to floor space. Why not get a real Farm
Engine as the prime mover of your plant? To get that
advantage you must select a belt-driven outfit—the type
we have been advocating and selling to the man on the
land for a number of years—the only really practical
outfit, because with it you can choose your light plant
by its ENGINE.
Here we are offering you a range of plants driven
by a “Lister” Engine—the “Rolls-Royce of Farm
Engines”—tried out and proved on thousands of farms
and stations on shearing, pumping, and any other every-
day job, an engine that only needs oiling once a month,
an engine that can run all night w.ithout attention, an
engine that is dust-proof and fool-proof. And it’s a
low-speed, water-cooled job—4oo/500 revolutions a
minute as against the 1500/1800 r.p.m. of most light-
plant engines! Think of the difference in wear and tear,
in maintenance costs and in reliability!
The “Lister” is needed for charging the storage bat-
tery only twice a week or so; the rest of the time the
whole of its power—2, 3 or more 8.H.P., as you choose
—is available for other work. You can even have the
engine portable if you wish. We have a very large range
of installations in N.S.W. to which we should like to
refer you if you are interested. Write now for special
catalogue.

BRISBIS CENTRAL TIN MINING COMPANY, No Liability.
Capital: £75»000, consisting of 100,000
Shares at 15/- each.
Payable 1/- on application, 1/- on allotment, 6d. per month for six months.
Owing to low price of tin and disturbed financial conditions this Company has
suspended active work for about two years, but everything has been kept in readiness
for a new start at short notice.
With tin at its present price of £2OO per ton or better it is felt that now is the time
to get going and to complete construction work, so that tin-raising may commence.
While it is estimated that £lO,OOO may be required to complete all works and to equip
the mine, an issue of 28,000, or about half of unsold shares at 55., will advance the w T orks
to such a stage that there will be no trouble in financing the balance, by debentures or the
issue of more of the unsold shares, w T hich the Directors feel confident will be disposed
of at a premium ; this will place the Company in a good financial position.
No applications will be accepted unless at least 20,000 shares are sold.
VALUE OF GROUND. —Nothing has occurred to lessen tne confidence of share-
holders in the value of the ground to be immediately worked when the water scheme is
completed for which this money is required. The boring has proved the existence of a
defined gutter running north-westerly through the ground. The head of the gutter, being
in comparatively shallow ground, was worked in the early days and was wonderfully
rich. A sudden dip in the gutter where it enters this Company’s leases prevented it being
followed, and it has been shown by boring that the gutter is beneath from 40 to 70 feet of
tin-bearing gravels. While the boring has proved the existence of tin in payable quantities
from 40 to 70 feet in depth and from top to bottom, yet owing to granite boulders the
44,963 Shares paid up to 10s. are now held by Shareholders.
55,037 Shares are held in trust by Company.
Special Issue of Shares (paid up to 10/-), offered at 5/- per Share.
actual gutter cannot be proved by boring. All experience in other alluvial mines goes to
show that when the gutters can be worked they are phenomenally rich- J-he well-known
Briseis Mine at Derby can be instanced. Yields jumped from about 30 tons to about lhO
tons per month once the gutter was traced and followed. All previous boring and shaft
sinking had failed to prove such values.
ECONOMICAL WORKING.—The present issue is to provide money to complete a
large storage dam and the connecting races to the mine, and much of the heavy and
expensive work has already been accomplished. The. water will take the . place of
expensive steam plants, and as soon as available will provide all the motive power
required to work the plant necessary for the recovery of tin oxide and the lighting of the
mine by electric light. , , " , ,_.
15 PER CENT. BONUS.—Some Shareholders have placed at disposal of Directors
sufficient shares (paid up to 10s.) to guarantee a bonus of 15 per cent, on present issue, to
all applicants completing payment of ss. per share on shares allotted. A successful
applicant for 1000 shares at ss. will thus receive 1150 shares paid up to 10s. when ss.
per share has been paid on the 1000 shares, or pro rata when more or less than 1000
shares are applied for. . , . . ,
Pending* the granting of applications a deposit of £1 per 100 shares is all that is required, /he
balance will be called for when allotment is made. In the event of no allotment all money received
as a deposit wi'l be refunded. A fair parcel of shares has already been applied for. Applications
will be received up to 30th June, 1923, but will close directly 28,000 shares are applied for.

“BILLABONG”
Windmills and Troughing
offer you a full measure of Service,
Dependability and Value.
Their outstanding quality and many exclusive features
make “BILLABONG” Pumping and Water-supply Plants
the preferred choice of all who demand the utmost of the
above qualities.
Referring to “BILLABONG” Windmills, an enthusi-
astic owner writes as follows:
“When in need of a Mill, I obtained catalogs of every
make of Mill known to me. These I submitted to two of
my brothers (who are expert mechanics, and one especially
skilled in machine design and construction), asking them to
pick out a Mill. They had not the slightest hesitation in
arriving at the conclusion that the absolute superiority of
the ‘BILLABONG ’ over all other makes was evidenced by
even the most casual perusal of the catalogs. I consider the
‘BILLABONG’ can give points to every other make of Mill
from top to bottom.”
“BILLABONG” Patent Steel Troughing is equally superior in
Its class. It is constructed on commonsense lines that enable it to
withstand rough usage and hard bumps. Its patent interlocking,
grooved joints are easily fitted together, cannot pull apart, and cannot
leak. “BILLABONG” Troughing is supported in a framework uf
heavy angle steel, and will give so many “years of extra service” that
it is easily the cheapest troughing proposition available.
There is much that we would like to tell you about
“BILLABONG” Mills and Troughing, but as the space available
here will not do them justice, we will gladly send you our illus-
trated booklet, “W. 65,” which tells the whole story. Write NOW
for your copy.

Why Don’t You Have Perfect Health?
*
m
Nature intended you to be strong, healthy and vigor-
ous, but if you neglect to exercise both vour internal
and external muscles, thereby strengthening your
lungs, digestive and other organs, you MUST pay the
penalty by having ill-health. It cannot be otherwise.
If you wish to enjoy perfect health —to become tit,
strong and well-developed—you must have correct and
sufficient exercise.
The Baker Postal Course of
Body Culture
consists of a series of simple, enjoyable and
graduated exercises, which bring into play the
neglected muscles, steady the nerves, make you
breathe in a natural manner, and induce all the
organs in the body to perform their functions
correctly. No apparatus of any kind is required
and the exercises are prescribed to suit your
individual requirements.

No notice (except of a hostile character) will he
taken of communications insufficiently Humped.
Name and address must appear on the MSS. No
liability is undertaken le contributions volun-
tarily submitted; and no MS. will be returned
unless stamps accompany.
Henry P.: That idea has been well
worked; and your man doesn’t talk naturally....
Vance M.: Merit in it; but it is hardly strong
enough to win a place G.F.R.; It probably
means something; but stuff that is half-poetry and
half-puzzle gets wearisome.... Besom: It had no
blood in it when it arrived and has joined the great
majority.... D.P.M.: Close up; the craftsmanship is
very fair D.F.D.: Very good of its kind. You
should have no difficulty in placing it elsewhere
Charlemont: Is it a new invention ? Prose we know
and verse we know, and it’s neither of them .... W.
McM.: No fresh idea ; and the work isn’t quite good
enough to stand on its own Wilf: “Frolics” has
had the juice sucked out of it. . . . F.A.M.: We will
consider anything. But it must have air all-Austra-
lian interest to stand a chance. .. -Chloe: Thanks;
but we’ll let the pair fight it out... . A.G.C.: Have
no idea whether it is original or not. It is pretty
poor whatever else it is.... Sam C.: Some dam-
sinkers asked you to have a drink. Six pages. Too
much... .D.D. (Glen 1.): Incredible yarn wearily
told. . .May C.: Goes heavily with too many words...
K. : “Bennie” is a bit thin. .. .Celia W.: The old
thing in fluttering verse.... H.J.G.: Rather pon-
derous fooling. .. .Winkle: No use G.A.C.: The
“Ring” is only three-carat; the other is bad prose. .. .
Collonna: Poorly constructed. First of all, make
your plans; then build your story on them....
Tcmpe: An ordinary railway journey without special
incident... .J.J.H.: You’ll have to learn to use
words in their proper meaning. ... N.B.M.: Suffers
from general umptiness... . W.M.R.: No use....
T.E. (Glenoura) : Suitable for the last page of an
imported washerlady’s album. (N.B.—The washer-
lady must be imported) D.P. (Whangerei) : Too
slight... .John E.: The old commonplaces.... Eye
C.: Weak verse without enough thought. .. .Joe D.:
Too rugged and crude T.R. • (Sans Souei); They
sing that sort of thing in the sort of drawing-rooms
in which the sort of people who read this sort of
paper are least comfortable... .W.E.B,: You kill
the yarn with ineffective words L.B. (St. Kilda):
Sorrowful and rubbishy R.S.R.; Not for us
A.W.: “Lost Hope” might well “change the curse”
of anything:—
Long ago a girl took me by her charm;
1 loved her ; my heart was true and warm;
She was false, her heart was icy cold,
And married for money a man twice as old.
This made me change the curse of my life; *
It brought me down, 1 never had a wife;
I tried to forget this cruel irony fate.
When I came to my senses then it was too late.
... Nararon: The “Bell” doesn’t hold the interest....
A.E.K.: Rather old material, and you don’t put a
living pulse in it... .C.M.C.: The verse is not good
enough to carry the idea.... Margaret M.: Loose
verse that rhymes sometimes and bumps often won't
do... .I.R.M.: Has movement, but deserves a little
more attention. For instance, you use “clouds that
fly” and “shapes that flee” in the same quatrain,
the verbs having the same meaning. Also the
“gather”-“leather” rhyme is a good one to avoid...
A.R.G.: Thin and futile Riverina: Not bad. But
why violate the sonnet form by using that final
couplet? The couplet belongs to the Shakspearean son-
net only....Seb Emm: Too many knobs on it....
P.A.L.: The “Wireless” thing breaks off on a feeble
jest just when it promised to be interesting....
Graham S.: Old [platitudes Vincent C.: Not
enough in “John Riley’s” tale. . . .F.C.B.: Verse no
good. Why not take a pen-name if the other
worries you? L.E.C.; A little worse and it would
have been a shocking example. .. .E.C.H.: There's
nothing to distinguish it from any other sunset. . . .
L. : Really not a yarn in it... .J.M. (Too-
woomba) : Verse bumps so much it made us quite
sore to read it W.P.W.: All those ideas have
been labored to death.... V.L.: Commonplace....
Jos. H.: Rather dreary.. . .G.T.C.: Not much in our
line....L.M. (Randwick): To get even with you
for rhyming “trees” with “leaves” we’ve rhymed
bad manuscript with waste-paper ' basket L.A.S.:
Misses... .E.B.Ii.: Doesn’t quite do it... .Stranger:
Nowhere near B.T.T.: No good G.E.P.: In
spots good. Have another try... .D.C.J.: Not
enough in it.... Griff W.: Doesn’t get there; but it
made a fair attempt.... Tyo: “Orison” goes heavily.
. .. .But: Too thin and weak... .Pelagios: Not up to
its possibilities.... Kat: The vivid account of the
breaking of the drought goes:—
After the bankers refused the cockies a sub.
They drifted along to Murphy’s pub;
Each one was doing exceedingly well
Till a wire-whisker blew in to tell
Of another petition he was getting up for rain.
lie begged the boys to give it a fly again.
And not a cocky in the crowd tried to shirk
Though most of them had to stagger to the kirk.
While the parson was beefing out their petition.
The Judge eyed the congregation with suspicion.
He was growing tired, hearing the same old refrain,
So he granted the cockies an extra lot of rain.
He sent it down- in bucketfulls, in torrents, then
more
Till the whole of the congregation stood and swore.
....Charles M.: Not enough there... .T.R.T.:
Doesn’t strike us... .Faceplate: Rather an old idea.
....Julie D.: Poor sort of limping verse... .J.W.:
“Quick Way” too slight.... Bernard M.: There is
a novelty about sleeping in the day to think of love
at night: but it seems a trifle insane. .. .A.F.M.:
Your orders to Night to send the world to sleep
will no doubt be obeyed.... Fid: Too close to the
commonplace... .M.B.R.: Don’t like it... .M.P,S.:
The verse hasn’t the strength to carry it.... S. McC.:
Not for us....N.W.S.B.: “Warm” rhymed with
“dawn” is a fresh horror... .Iv.F.A.: Pity our eyes
and buy a penn’orth of ink. The mud you use is
as hard to read as the intentions of a spider....
C.C.M.: Not up F.G.G.: Fluttered to the basket.
Svranx: Not well enough told....M. Bool:
“Deal” hadn’t quite the strength to go the distance.
A.C.M.: Thanks ; but he was discussed at fair length
a few months ago. .. .George A. (Mt. Morgan) : Sound
sense, anvwav; but not very attractively presented.
Podg: Get it cut if it’s long hair makes you
do things li 1 -'’ that.
TO ARTISTIC (AND INARTISTIC)
CORRESPONDENTS.
P.W.: A good way to go yet. .. .T.W.D.: Those
frogs would drive the Abo. Council mad C.J.W.:
No hope for sketches in writing ink on ruled paper
—except, of course, as ideas... .E.K.: Drawing
weak and jokes weaker T.L.: Not up; and where
do coastguards live in Australia?... .W.Ii.C.: A
bad miss. . . . Kem : A worse missus.... G.R.: Con-
torted gent, and bald-headed boy disqualified
V.R.: feeble little thing. .. .E.Ii.G.: Labored joke.
G.B.: Not much interested in princes jumping
hurdles. .. .E.A.D.: Sketch shows striking imagina-
tion—in the matter of hands. .. .A.M.M.: Smudgy
drawing in pencil no use J.K.: Much more to
learn yet M.C.: Mayoress too suggestive of
fashionplate drawing. . . .C.A.P.: Careless drafts-

MISS ELLIE BHEEDY,
a Beautiful Tasmanian.
Rexona Girl.
Girls!
Beauty is
All
Supreme
Rexona Girls are beautiful girls, and Rexona Babies are the pride of Australia. To be
beautiful you must have a good complexion and bright, fresh, clear skin. This is what Rexona
Soap does for its devotees.
No matter if your features are irregular, beauty is not denied you, for every woman can
have a good complexion if she but cares for the skin by using Rexona Soap. Rexona Soap is the
ready aid to those in search of skin health and beauty. Everything that is necessary for over-
coming complexion ills is combined in its generous, creamy lather. Rexona Soap refreshes and
invigorates at the same time, removes the tendency to blotches, sallowness, oiliness or roughness
of the skin. No matter how particular you may be, Rexona Soap is sure to satisfy you, for it
is the aristocrat of Soaps, pure and free from harmful dry chemicals. It is a facial Soap specially
suitable for the most delicate skin. Rexona Soap has no heavy perfume, only the delightful
Rexona fragrance. It lathers freely, cleanses perfectly, and leaves the face and hair in the pink
of condition.
WHY NOT ENJOY A GOOD COMPLEXION?
You cannot if you do not care for the delicate skin of the face. When you wash your face
do you realise that it is not enough to simply remove the dirt, but that your skin needs a soothing,
healing influence to keep your complexion fresh and free from blemish?
Scented toilet soaps are often very pleasant, but do not assert this influence, as you are
well aware. Many of them contain free alkali, which tends to dry up the skin and destroy its
delicate texture. Even the better class of such soaps do not in any way help to improve the skin,
but Rexona Skin and Facial Soap is not only an absolutely pure soap, but is medicated on the same
principle as the famous Rexona Ointment, which is known throughout Australasia as the Rapid
Healer. That is why Rexona Soap really does for the skin and face what cosmetics are supposed
to do, by ensuring not only a clean face, but a pure and healthy skin, and thus gives you a clear
complexion.
Shampoo Your Hair with REXONA SOAP.
Do you know that in less than ten minutes you can double
the beauty of your hair? It becomes light, wavy, fluffy, abundant,
and appears as soft, lustrous and charming as anyone could desire
after a simple wash with Rexona Soap. A delightful surprise
awaits those whose hair has been neglected, or is scraggy, dry, brittle
or thin. Rexona Soap cleanses the hair of all dust, dirt or excess
oil, and in a few moments you have doubled the beauty of your
hair. Rexona Soap dissolves every particle of dandruff, cleanses,
purifies and invigorates the scalp, for ever stopping itching and
falling hair. If you care to have pretty hair, and lots of it, get a
tablet of Rexona Soap to-day.

Clifton Gardens Hotel
An exclusive Residential Hotel conveniently close to the City, standing on a
commanding slope among the wooded hills of Mosinan.
A broad beach of silvery sand and rocky foreshores afford endless delight
to the children. The unique bathing amphitheatre invites the visitor to all the
luxuries of sea bathing. In the evening there is Dixieland nearby, with Derriman s
Orchestra and a perfect floor; billiards, etc.
Fast, commodious steamers give direct access to Circular Quay, immediately
among the pastoralist firms and the Government offices. The theatres, shopping,
racing and other centres are reached by short direct routes.
The unique charm and convenience of Clifton Gardens Hotel appeal equally
to the business man on a hurried visit; as to the family seeking recreation.
Terms from guineas. Special fates for special arrangements on request.

“L’Fou”: I suppose Clancy of the Over-
now and the other storied drovers will sit
up—if they don’t turn in their graves—
when they hear of it. Railway trucks were
bad enough, but now stock are being bustled
to market per motor. Recently 45 fat lambs
were brought thus from Mullenganda tc
Albury, something over 20 miles. The trip
took two hours, and the cost was Is 6d a
head.
* * * *
“Jobber”: Re deductions from men’s wages
for medical attention. Broken Hil] is not
Place where this is done (B.
17/0/ 24). On the Murrumbidgee Irrigation
Area mnepence per week is deducted from
each man's wages, and paid, plus a subsidy
from the Commission, to the local medico.
It s a good thing for some of the toilers, par-
ticularly the married ones. And for Saw-
bones.
* * * *
“Harold Hardupp” : The N.S.W. egg-ex-
ploiters who shipped eggs to England, content
to put up with a loss as long as local prices
could be maintained, were hit harder than
they expected. A million dozen eggs went
overseas, where, to show the smallest margin
ot profit, they would have to fetch 2s. Bd.
per doz. Actually, the average realised was
only Is 1 l-sd. The experience may well
have filled the manipulators with gloomy
doubts about their ability to hold up prices
by these methods. Anyway, although still
high enough in Sydney, thev are 4d. lower
than they were at this time last year.
“U.P.”: The Greig-Allen system of airless
storage was recently tried on the China-
Australian steamer Victoria, between Mel-
bourne and Hong Kong. Apples, grapes,
lemons, pears and oranges were stored in
steel containers, 7ft. by sft. by sft., from
which the air was then pumped. All the
fruit arrived in splendid condition except
the apples, and the trouble with them can
probably be overcome. It is anticipated that
the new system will be the means of open-
ing up a large export fruit trade with our
North. And there is hope with regard to
potatoes. The tubers have refused to keep
under refngerator conditions. The airless
method is to be invited to show what it can
do with them.
.‘‘Hobson’s Bay”: “Salamander” complains
'H. 10/5/23) that the first-class cabins on
the Bay steamers are unbearably hot. When
Larkm has remedied this I suggest that he
should give orders that more Australian pro-
ducts find their way into the pantry. Fancy
being served with English fish and jams
while lying in Sydney Harbor! The stewards
are courteous enough towards passengers,
out they are adepts in leaving undone the
little things which make for comfort on a
long voyage. Another howling grievance is
the cleansing of the decks. This starts at
sea at 8 a.m. and continues often till after
noon. I have seen sea-sick women huddled
on deck chairs on a hatch cover all day be-
cause of the sloppiness of the decks. Having
a predilection for public ownership of trans-
port utilities I booked my passage by the
line, and can certify that it offers a maxi-
mum of discomfort;. After my own experi-
ences I have ceased to wonder that a promi-
nent Queensland socialist is travelling to
Fogland in a black-manned liner
* * . .
“Alastor”: Muttaburra (Q.) is mv nomi-
nation for the most generously-pubbed settle-
ment m Australia. The ‘“Burra,” as it is
affectionately styled, has a population of
about 100, for whose malted and spirituous
requirements six thriving taverns cater.
I here is a “dry stage,” 100 yards between beers
—and a local poet who divides his time be-
tween the six pubs entertaining visitors with
verse on the beauty of the local barmaids.
One hotel had written on it. in the good old
days: “This is a pub.” I asked the pro-
prietor the reason for this quaint notice. He
told me with intense bitterness that his hotel
was once mistaken for a grocer’s shop, and
he proposed to guard against the recurrence
of such a baneful mistake.
* * * *
“Te Pana”: An early-door gallery queue
can’t beat the line-up of saloon passengers
awaiting the second steward’s allocation of
places at table on the run from M.L. to
Australia. At 4.40 the first day out there
is a wild surge of pale-faced people stolidly
viewing each other with deepest suspicion.
In turn each is moved up into the Presence,
states his requirements, age. nationality,
views on Bruce, and what he thinks about
Hickson —the queries are about as relevant
as these, anyhow. If you look like a tourist
or an American pork-packer, vou’re sure of
springing to the first bugle-call; but if yom
pants bag at the knees, the crumbs from the
main sitting will be your lot. But why
should harassed passengers have to undergo
this sea _ ritual ? A s berths are allocated
at the time of booking, the shinping cos.
wouldn t feel the strain. over-much if they
did likewise with seats at table.
THE RAMPANT RODENTS.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
“Every rat consumes, in the course of 12 months,
tood to the value of from 25s. to 30s.”
Cost of living high;
Means to meet it, nil;
Though you try and try
You can’t foot the bill.
Consolation slight—
Though you lack a meal,
Not a single bite
Can the grey rats steal.
Food of any kind.
Not the smallest crumb
Will the robber* find
When again they come.
Tradesmen half-a-score,
The whole collector trew
Daily on the door
Beat a loud tattoo.
Driven near insane
(Rats’ parade begun)
Your unbalanced brain
Fancies each a dun,
Scrambling at the door
In a frenzied mob,
Each one shrieking for
Five-and-twenty bob.

“T. 0.1.”: It was stated in a recent S. M.
Herald that the grave of the botanist-ex-
Cunningham, on the Bogan
(N.8.W.), is in a state of disrepair. Allan’s
bones, however, are in Sydney Botanical
Cardens. The grave on the Bogan is that
ot Richard Cunningham, who took part in
lhos. L. Mitchell’s second expedition, and
was killed by natives.
. M.T.” ; Maoriland’s Postal Department
chips in with a claim for a record. A letter
was pushed into the pillar-box at Midhurst in
January, 1904, and was found recently in
the lining of the edifice. The actual lost
time was 19 years 3 months 11 days, and it
might have been there for another 100 years
had not prying officialdom thought it time
the box was disinfected.
“The Deacon” : K.C. Bishop O’Connor, of
Armidale (N.S.W.), is celebrating the 20th
anniversary of his episcopal consecration.
Hearty and jovial, he gives the impression
ot being as much Bohemian as cleric, and be
is easily the most popular R.C. bish. in chp-
tivity. The history of New England is the
history of J. J O’Connor, who has been as
much concerned with its material prosperity
the R.C. part of its soul.
. “ Six , and Eight”: The extract from Bligh’s
K“ rn ,? : 1 dated June 12, 1789, and cited by
“irf- 6 !, 17/o/23), does not prove that
Bligh and his party did not land anywhere
on the east coast of Australia.” As a matter
ot tact they did land, and this extract from
the diary of the earlier days of June proves it :
Tin'll?,!,i' ad n ? w , b f e " s > x days on the coast of New
Holland, and but for the refreshment which our
visits to its shores afforded us it is all but certain
that we must have perished.
“Wart”: “Donalbain’s” par (B. 3/5/’231
reminds me that the best handlers of small
poats about the Australian coast to-day are
the half-castes of Flinders Islands—the de-
scendants of white sealers and native women
lhe meeting of the currents round the islands
and the strong tides make navigation
there as dangerous as in any part of the
world, but the half-castes will put to sea in
anything that will float. It is not once in
a blue moon that one comes to grief, either.
The Federal Government is pledged to
supply the members of the Veterans’ Assoc
who saw service before 1885 with a dinner
once a year, just to show that old soldiers
are not forgotten. At this year’s feast in
feydney three oldsters turned out who were
8b each, and there was one (J. Bates) who
was 90. One of the 86-ers, G. Margott, is
a Crimean veteran ( a batch of them passed
out during the last 12 months) ; C. Kidd
was in the Indian Mutiny; a nd W. Rich
served in the Baltic Expedition.
“C.M.M.”; Cotton-growing only started
on the North Coast (N.S.W.) last year, but
already one record has been cracked In a
four-acre plot grown by A. Byrnes at Old
Bonalbo was a plant bearing 325 bolls. The
best 1 had previously heard of bore 298, and
it was grown under special conditions,
whereas this was merely part of the ordi-
nary crop. Incidentally, it was planted in
September, which fact should have some
weight when the early or late sowing ques-
tion is being discussed.
“D.F.” : The old-time Bow-street runners,
who preceded the police force in the U.K.,
were a bit slow, but they were very thorough
sometimes. The sweep which they made of
the once notorious criminal family of the
Dunhills (of Yorkshire) could hardly have
been cleaner. In his “Life” Snowden Dun-
hili noted amongst other things as a bee-
stealer, recw'ds the transportation to Aus-
tralia of himself, his wife, two sons, two
daughters, and no fewer than five sons-in-law'
not to speak of a stepson. One daughter
had three husbands transported before she
followed them herself, the other only two
What happened to the clan at this end is
not related. The elder Dunhill was well
known as a seller of pies in Hobart Town
about 1833.
“Jobber”: To what base uses some ex-
service men put the badge! A bird flew
into this town, went to the Soldiers’ Club
and after a yarn with the caretaker (an ex-
Digger) casually mentioned that he (the
bird) had heard that the caretaker ran a
small book on the ponies. Billjim disclaimed
the .doubtful honor. The visitor was very
persistent, implored his “comrade” to be a
sport, and as he left threw five bob on the
table to go on Queen of the Fairies or some
such prad. The caretaker left the money
where it fell, and, for all I know, it is still
there. Admitting that sly betting should be
stopped, and someone has to do the pimping,
what sort of a “cobber” must he be who
would use his badge in such a service?
Reoh : Our troopship let a few hundred
of us loose in Virginia (U.S.) and Nova
fecotia. (Canada). Newport News was full
of uniformed “guys” from various States,
who reckoned we “talked like Englishmen” •
that is what struck them. Unlooked for the
same comment was made in Halifax, i’ felt
complimented until we reached England
after which I had doubts. A considerable
period spent in the U.K. leaves me still
doubting. Of criticism heard there on the
point of speech, one piece sticks: it was con-
tained in the query, “Are you not a clergy-
man. levelled at me by a man with whom
I had got into a yarn. Our vowel sounds
may have the tendencies so commonly attri-
buted to them, but if we make “cows” into
keows,” the Pommy here or at home makes
them cays” and a house “a hace.” This
trick strikes me as being his most abiding
weakness of speech.
, pro P° s l “W.J.H.’s” memories
Of 5 - 24/5/23) of the last fight in N. S.
Wales between bushrangers and the police.
It was Governor Loftus who commuted the
death sentences passed on Williams, alias
Johns, and Bennett, on account of their
youth. But the former of the pair didn’t
■profit much thereby. While in Parramatta
Gaol he was so badgered by another prisoner
who was doing 10 years for cutting the
throat of a racehorse at Hay that he dug a
dinner knife into his tormentor. Tried again
before Justice Windeyer, who had heard the
Wantabadgery case, he was once more sen-
tenced to death and this time hanged, despite
extenuating circumstances. Loftus refused to
interfere again. Windeyer, in passing sen-
tence, had expressed his surprise that he had
not been consulted when the first sentence
was commuted. It transpired that the Gov-
ernment, on the Judge’s advice, had left all
four of the bushrangers to hang; but Loftus
stepped in to exercise the royal prerogative
of mercy, as Carrington did in the case
of some of the Mount Rennie boys.

REX HAM PATE
On every side you hear it proclaimed that Rex Ham
Pate is the thrifty housewives’ great stand-by in
helping to solve the sandwich problem—whether for
the children’s or the worker’s daily lunches—or for
picnics where appetites need littie coaxing.
Rex Ham Pate is all Ham —prepared in the exclusive
Rex way that gives it the most delectable flavor.
Try Rex Ham Pate by itself if you will. Add sliced
Tomato, Cucumber, beetroot, Chopped Olive,
Lettuce, Horseradish, Anchovy Sauce or Mayonnaise,
if you desire a change.
The young folks will soon show their appreciation—
and you’ll get lots of praise from them for “those
different sandwiches” which are eaten with zest.

[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
f I THROUGH the garden, row on row,
I Marches bannered Mexico !
Cortez sleeps, his sword is rust;
Montezuma’s pride is dust;
But the sun with flaming boast
Shines upon the dahlia host
Marching on tvith flags unfurled
To the conquest of the world.
Spring with scent of violet
Walked in sandals dewy wet.
Rose-time came with garlands gay
Blowing perfume down the day.
But hot summer at the gate
Sought a lustier, bolder mate,
Made his hottest kisses glow
For the queen of Mexico.
St. lago and Castile
Walked the land on iron heel,
Brought with fire their bitter gain
To the reddened feet of Spaiu.
Spain to-day has less of power
Than one Mexicano flower;
Less, for all her vaunted spoil,
Of the tilth of alien soil
Than' the bloom that could outgrow
Ruin’s pride in Mexico.
Drums that beat across the world,
Bolts of death and vengeance hurled,
Men whose names are written low
In the dust where no deeds grow,
What of conquest, what of power?
Ages yield to one proud flower
Homage evermore denied
To your blood-bespattered pride.
Blossom of the least of lands,
Sceptred in our midst she stands,
Crying to the winds that blow
“Garden room for Mexico!”
Montezuma’s faded name
Fills an hour of ancient shame,
Scarce remembered more than they
Who set blood on yesterday.
Only where true life and strong
Brings a willing soil to song,
And the homes of men are made
Far from conquest’s reeking blade,
Over years brave peace shall know
Marches splendid Mexico.

[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
CROSS-LEGGED on the hearthrug, two
drawers of her writing-desk before
her, the floor littered and the fire blaz-
ing spasmodically, sat Daphne burning love-
letters.
No woman likes burning love-letters, and
Daphne was essentially feminine. Tears
came and she brushed them away ; her heart
ached, and her plucky, if misguided, soul
called it sharply to task ; words that had been
magic once cried to her from the pages, and
she put them resolutely on the coals and
watched the flames kill them.
It was characteristic of her sex, too, that
instead of burning the whole packet blindly
she heaped exquisite torture on herself. She
knew the letters off by heart, but she read
each one, crushing back the impulse to cry
over it, to hold it against her face, to shut
her eyes, and by sheer force of love to drag
his spirit close to her; to admit, even in
a luxury of abandonment, that his spirit was
not enough, that she wanted his arms and
his lips, and the smell of his rough tweed
coat, and the sound of his big voice soften-
ing over her name.
She was no psychologist, you observe, and,
as. is sometimes the case with your Quixotic
people, she was hardly honest to herself, her
dead husband or the man she was to marry
the next day. Nor did she know that thoughts,
like creditors, cannot be repressed, but must
be met one by one, dealt with, and sent away
satisfied. So, having made up her mind to
be a good wife to Ralph Evans, she burnt
.Tim Davidson’s love-letters and bullied her
thoughts into temporary submission —as may
be done also with creditors.
The last letter was gone, and a photo-
graph lay face downwards at the bottom of
one of the drawers. Daphne eyed it —there
is torture and torture. Then she looked up
at the mantelpiece where her fiance’s face
stared rather blankly in front of him from
a plain silver frame. A psychologist would
have told you that her unconscious mind
was crying out for reassurance. Let us be
charitable and blame the photographer if she
found none.
She took her husband’s picture from the
drawer and put it carefully, and still face
downwards, on the fire. She watched it
shrivel, unaware that the very act of burn-
ing it proclaimed her uncertain of her heart
and a fugitive from her unconscious love.
She had no idea that the ostentatious replace-
ment of those dear, burnt letters by a newer
bundle, the fact that she had given the old
frame to the new photograph, were the
blatant efforts of her conscious mind to
deceive her. .
She rose stiffly, replaced and locked the
drawers and looked round the room. Her
trunks stood ready packed. By the burning
of a few letters she imagined she had put
the old love behind her. Good! She and
Ralph would start life to-morrow with a
clean slate.
* * * *
I.
“Telephone, telegraph or tell a”
He pulled himself up sharply on the old
adage and substituted “ write a letter.
Damn it all,” he said, “my mind still wan-
ders. I mustn’t go to her myself—that’s cer-
tain. Too much of a shock for her!”
He sat on the edge of the bed, staring
abstractedly round the small hotel bedroom,
busy with his thoughts. They always kept
him busy these days ; they needed to be guided,
marshalled, ordered, for they had not yet
found their way back into the old, smooth-
running groove. When a man, minus ins
memory, has been lost for three years in a
strange country, his mind, even though cured,
needs a little adjusting when he returns to
his normal world.
Daphne’s husband, therefore, sat on his bed
pondering how best to break to her the news
of his return to life.
“Telephone, telegraph or—write a letter,”
he murmured, and sat brooding over the
respective merits of the three courses open
to him.
He decided suddenly. “I’ll write.”
An hour later he was still scribbling—
eager, impetuous words, hot with his love
for her, and the impatience of one who sees
health in sight after a long illness. All their
love came flooding back as he wrote—war
love, it had been; passionate, intense, with
a note of desperation ; a feverish anxiety to
live every second of their little time together.
He felt his own old personality again; he
saw himself as he had been then —ardent,
vibrant with life and enthusiasm, bringing
shouts of laughter and uproarious good spirits
wherever he went. He remembered ho_w,
strictly in private, she had called him
“Hubbub” —“nicer than hubby, and much
more suitable!” —and these trifling memories
seemed to bring back with them the very
essence of all that had been beautiful in
their marriage. A little of it leaked out,
perhaps, through his fingertips and found its
way down the pen on to the paper, for he
wrote her a letter beside which the. ones she
had burned were the amemic offerings of a
schoolboy.
Then like a crash a thought came to him.
He sat very still, dealing with it for a few
minutes; then he wrote the next words
slowly:—
“Three years is a long time, and you must
have been lonely. If you don’t want me
don’t answer this at all. I can just dis-
appear again.”
He meant to end it there, but another
trickle of love found its way down the pen
and he scribbled impulsively:—
“Be glad I have come back, sweetheart.”
Through the crowd of Daphne’s friends
on the wharf her maid pushed breathlessly,
and touched the “best man” on the arm.
“This letter, sir, came by messenger-boy
for Mrs. Davidson —Mrs. Evans, I mean.
It’s marked Urgent.’ ”
The “best man” balanced it in his hand.
“Right! I can easily throw it up. Hi!
Daph! Here’s a letter for you. Catch?” .
Daphne was settling up with her brain-
creditors who had begun to clamor directly
the marriage ceremony was over, and she
was feeling rather dazed.
She nodded. It was rash of her, for her
eyes were half-blind with tears. Something
white whizzed close to her; for half-a-seeond
she held the letter in her hands—fumbled it
—missed it —and watched it sink.
* * * *
11.
“Telephone, telegraph or —write a letter,”
he murmured, and sat brooding over the re-
spective merits of the three courses open to
him.
He decided suddenly. “I’ll wire.’
He ponderedfor a long time over the word-
ing. He tried 50 different ways. He
wasted sheets of paper. What he finally
achieved was this: “Have been very ill.
.Just returned. Shall I come to you? Write
to 59 Henley-street” —he paused a moment,
and added slowly—“if you want me.”
That was better. He signed it “Jim,” but
a flash of inspiration made him alter it to
“Hubbub.” It looked ridiculous, of course,
but it carried conviction, and she might well
need to be convinced, poor girl, after three
years.
It came just as they were leaving the house.
The wedding was to be quite informal, and
bride and bridegroom were to drive together
to the church. She was pulling on her
gloves, and Ralph took it from the boy and
stuffed it carelessly in his pocket.
“More congratulations!” he said, smiling
at her, and she nodded rather listlessly. She
had spent half the morning opening tele-
grams.
In the vestry before the ceremony he stood
with an elaborate air of unconcern before
the tiny coal fire while the formalities were
being carried out. The traditional fears of
the bridegroom beset him. Had he remem-
bered everything? His hand, feeling anxi-
ously through his pockets, encountered the
telegram. Daphne, sitting down in front
of the register and taking the pen from the
clergyman, met his eyes for a moment.
“Shall I open it?” he asked.
She smiled her assent.
He read it, full of his own thoughts, and
only half taking in the sense of it. The
signature conveyed nothing to him —its
absurdity, in fact, added to his passing
spasm of irritation that anyone should have
sent so inconsiderate a telegram on a wed-
ding day.
“Mr. Evans, please? Will you sign
this?”
He dropped the telegram on the fire and
attended to the business on hand. The for-
malities over, there occurred one of those
slight hitches which are apt to mar all cere-
moflies. Daphne, shaking with what she
imagined to be natural nervousness, tried to
say something easy afid conversational:
“What was the wire about?”
He looked startled.
“Oh, I say, I threw it in the fire! Sorry,
but I wasn’t' thinking. It was something
about someone having been very ill and just
returned, and wanting you to write to some
address —I’ve forgotten. It was signed
‘Hubbub’ Daph!”
Her face was chalk white, and she
clutched his arm ; her eyes were wide with
—what was it? Terror? Hope?
The whole room was watching, dumb with
amazement. Her voice came slowly, fear-
fully :
“Asking me to write?”
“Yes. ‘Write if you want me’ —some-
thing like that. What is it, dearest?”
He was bending over her anxiously, some
dim recollection at the back of his mind
that brides were prone to hysteria.
“Ralph,” she said presently, very softlv,
as one speaks in a cathedral, “what was the
address ?”
He ran his fingers helplessly through his
hair.
“I don’t know, Daph. I’ve forgotten. Was
it so important?”

Finish the Day Well!
HOW do you feel in
the evening? Are
you weary and spent
after your day’s work, in-
clined to doze in an arm-
chair, too tired even to go
to bed? Or are you brisk,
alert, jolly, ready to put
aside the cares of the day
and spend your leisure
hours in whole-hearted
enjoyment, feeling that
the evening is too precious
for inaction? Your health
decides*the answer?
You should come home
as keen for the evening’s
entertainment as you
started (or should have
started) on your day’s
work. If you fail to keep
thus vigorous and active
throughout the day there
is something wrong with
your health. Your liver
and kidneys are not work-
ing as they should. Im-
purities have collected in
the system and contamin-
ated the blood, every func-
tion of the body is dulled
and impeded. Headaches,
tiredness, depression, loss
of interest, lack of enthu-
siasm follow. To regain
health and energy you
must stimulate the action
of the liver and kidneys.
How?
By acquiring the Krus-
chen habit of health.
A tiny pinch of Krus-
chen Salts in your break-
fast cup of tea every morn-
ing will soon make a dif-
ference. Kruschen is not
one salt, but six, just the
six the body needs,
blended in Nature’s pro-
portion. Normally these
salts should be extracted
from your food, but insuf-
ficient fresh air and exer-
cise, unsuitable diet, over-
work or worry prevent
the system from obtaining
them in the natural way.
Kruschen supplies the
need. It invigorates the
internal organs, gently
cleanses impurities from
the body, purifies and en-
riches the blood, fills the
whole being with new life
and new energy.
Try it.
Just a small dose every
morning will make you fit
and keep you fit. You will
be able to enjoy your
evenings to the full and to
look forward to another
day made bright by the
joy of perfect health.
Tasteless in Tea
Put as much in each
breakfast cup as will
lie on a sixpence. It’s
the little daily dose
that does it.
đ
Good Health for a Farthing a Day
The dose of a sixpenceful taken
every morning is found in practice
just the right amount for a most in-
vigorating daily tonic. The medici-
nal dose for persons suffering from
pains of rheumatism and gout, or
habitual constipation, with inactive
liver, etc., is half to one teaspoonful
in a tumbler of hot water before
breakfast.
Every chemist sells Kruschen Salts.
One bottle contains 96 morning
“pinches”—enough to last three
months. Get a bottle to-day.

Daphne stood quite still. Her creditors were
giving her a bad time, and making such a
noise inside her head that she felt giddy,
khe spoke to the clergyman, still in the same
soft, slow voice:
"I’ve had a telegram from my husband.
I his marriage—I’m sorry—it can’t go on!”
111.
“Telephone, telegraph or—write a letter,”
he murmured, and sat brooding over the
respective merits of the three courses open
to him.
He decided suddenly. “I’ll ’phone.”
He fought the instrument for half-an-hour,
and then had a rest and a drink before tack-
ling it again.
No, I’ll answer it, Mary. You take my
sul tcase down and then come back.”
She put the receiver to her ear.
Hullo?”
She had insisted on answering the tele-
phone herself for one reason only. She
wanted to say, just once more: “Yes, Mrs.
Davidson speaking.” But the first note of
the voice she heard asking the number made
her hot and then cold—-dizzy—incredulous!
She pulled herself together.
I’m imagining things. Hullo! Mrs.
Davidson speak”
Daphne! It’s Jim here! Don’t you
know my voice? Hubbub!”
Thfre was a hammering in her brain
which was the merciless stampeding of her
creditors suddenly let loose; a din in her
which was their voices shouting at her:
it s Jim. You love him! You love Jim
—only Jim !”
She heard her husband speaking through
the clamor:
“Shall I come at once?”
Jim ! Darling!”
Cl’'\ lere * n h a lf- an -hour.”
Daphne stood looking at the telephone in
a puzzled way as though she had never seen
one before.
-I hen she sent for Ralph. For one second
the thought of going through with it had
come wildly to her brain, but she had learned
the price of dishonesty to oneself. She loved
.Jim, not Ralph. She had done Ralph a great
wrong, and her punishment was that the
power to make amends was not hers.
So he came, and she told him, and he went
away. There were hard words, of course,
explanations to relatives, tears (not
Daphnes), confusion and surprise. There
was consternation on the part of guests, at

P. O’R.
The Dago.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
HE was known in the district as “The
Dago.” The term happened to be
correct in this case; it is derived
from the Spanish “Diego,” and that was his
name.
He lived on the side of a mountain. Be-
hind his hut a creek dropped over gleaming
boulders, splashing the bracken. Late in
winter, sweetness of the interspersed wattle-
gold hung about the kindling sapling-tops;
and, when spring came, the clematis spread
trails of starry flowers, diffusing fragrance
as light becomes mist in the Milky Way.
He had lived here alone for 10 years. The
sturdy, quiet beauty of the place was mild-
ness to his passionate blood, which was
made manifest in the blackness of his hair
and beard and the glitter of his dark eyes.
Otherwise the tawny color of his skin
might have been taken for sunburn.
When he had first come there the place
was a solitude. It was still quiet, but,
with the building of a railway, a township
had gradually grown up around the station
in the valley, and tourist tracks were made
through the gullies. Now holiday-makers
often passed his hut on their way up the
mountain. He lived by cutting timber.
Sometimes people stopped to speak to him
as he worked. He would answer them
shortly and kindly, and, if they happened
to come to him as he stood in his open door-
way, he would allow them to satisfy their
curiosity to look inside. There was not much
to see. A small bookcase made of pack-
ing-case wood held some old works in
Spanish, which would have been a rare find
for a bibliomaniac, and, besides the usual
litter of a bushman’s reading, a few de-
votional works in Latin. His furniture
had the rough neatness of self-sufficiency—
almost austerity, for there was no orna-
mentation except (if it could be called an
ornament) a curious dagger that hung on
the wall above his bunk. It was formed
like a cross. The thin, bright blade thick-
ened up to the nailed feet, and across the
hut st-retched the pierced hands, surmounted
by the drooping head, of the crucified
Christ. It was a relic of mediaeval times,
the symbol and instrument of some obscure
Holy Brotherhood, one of those old Orders
which, mellower if less virile, st'll persist in
their remote mountains. Every night and
every mornig Diego muttered a prayer be-
fore this sinister crucifix, crossing himself,
in the Spanish fashion, first on the lips and
then on the breast.
One hot summer day a stranger came
panting up the steep foot-track from the
gully and asked at the hut for a drink of
water. Diego stared at him for a moment
then, turning to fill the pannikin that hung
by his waterbag, glanced at his visitor from
the corners of his eyes, and in that glance
there was fierce recognition.
The stranger took the pannikin and gulped
thirstily. “Ah, that’s better! Thanks.”
” ith bis hat in his hand he stood in the
shade of the doorway looking over the scene
outside. He was a rather stout man. with
a pleasant, florid face. He had that air of
polite self-conceit which is met with in
many educated Englishmen, and something
about him —an indulgent, panoramic, snap-
shot gaze, a habit of scenic appraisement
suggested the globe-trotter. “It’s a
pretty spot,” he went on suavely, “a good
view, too—but the hill’s the deuce. And
that track! What the Spanish would call
a trail for cats. Phew!”
"You have been to Spain?”
A stealthiness in the question, and a cer-
tain familiar husky softening of the con-
sonants, caused the stranger to turn.
“Yes,” he said —“there and the Argentine.
Ho you” He stopped short, and stood
with his mouth open. The dagger hanging
on the wall had caught his eye. “That’s
odd, now! May I”-
He took a step forward and reached up a
hand ; but before he could touch the weapon
it was snatched down by the bushman,
whose face thus came into the light of the
doorway.
"Diego!” he ejaculated with surprise.
“Edmunds! I know you,” said Diego.
The Englishman was still staring aston-
ished. “Of course you do,” he replied.
“But, damn it, fancy running across you
here like this! It dawned on me vaguely
as soon as I caught sight of that blas-
phemous dagger. How odd!”
“Where is Camilla?” asked Diego
sharply.
Edmunds uttered a short laugh which
trailed a little sadly at the end, like a brave
flag when the wind drops. “You always were
a strange fellow, Diego. How it takes one
back across the years! Camilla and I
parted long ago, and she is”
“She is dead?” half-whispered Diego.
“You killed her!” he burst out as Edmunds
nodded.
“I—now —what amazing nonsense you
talk! You haven’t grown up, Diego, in
spite of the whiskers. I wish you could
have seen your little sister at the finish! I
wanted her to marry me then. She was —
beautiful words! — unu bellisima senora.
South America did the rest. She cleared
out with another fellow. How did you come
here? There was some absurd story about
your following us, and Camilla Used to be
frightened— at first!”
Diego did not answer for a while. They
both looked out dreamily at the green of
spreading bracken, the silver-green of gum-
leaves, the misty blue-green of distant wooded
hills. The noon sunlight made all unshaded
surfaces harsh, and the monotonous noise
of cicadas in the gully vibrated tensely
through its sultriness.
Diego began to speak in a sort of sorrow-
ful chant, hypnotic and absent, low as deep
violin notes that ache from the strings into
the resonance of the wood, with an occa-
sional pitiful pizzicato. “I sought her. I
sought you. I sought you both. I went to
Argentina. I went working where the ships
took me. I came here. I had almost for-
gotten till this day.”
Edmunds, watching him with faintly
amused sympathy, sighed. “It is the only
thing that makes life endurable —forgetting.
I treat these things lightly, perhaps. What
is the phrase —la mano blanda? But I too
have been tolerably chastised. I have grown
rich, Diego. I am that horrible thing, a self-
made man. Those vintages (after God)
brought me a fortune. And now I have
nothing to hope for. I believe in nothing.”
He stopped suddenly, for it occurred to him
that he was maundering in the same weakly
egotistic fashion as Diego. The thought
roused the devils of banter that kept his
heart alive, and he smiled.
The smile seemed to rouse Diego, who
now stood watching him closely, with his
arms tightly folded, the point of the dagger
showing under his left elbow. All of a sud-
den he flung up the hand that held it. His
fingers gripped the blade, which was thus
hidden, and his attitude was that of a priest
elevating the Host.
“Do you believe in the Christ?” he said
with drawn lips.
Edmunds laughed in spite of himself. It
was all so utterly, so unreally absurd. He
remembered an old Spanish proverb.
“An old Moor makes a bad Christian,
Diego.” Then suddenly he saw the fanatic
fury in the Spaniard’s eye. “Diego,” he
said quietly, “you know as well as—better
than I do, the legend of that dagger; but,
even if God’s power of vengeance be invested
in his priest, will not its instrument bring
punishment to the apostate—to you who have
broken your vows—you who left the monas-
tery to seek out a worldly revenge?” He
held out his hand. A ridiculous feeling came
over him that he was preaching, though he
was really only humoring the "fellow.
“Come,” he said, “give it to me before
any harm comes to you.”
But in a flash Diego’s hand descended, the
point of the blade gleaming. Edmunds had
just time to stumble aside in the awkward-
ness of sudden panic. Somehow he caught
hold of Diego’s arm above the wrist as they
both tripped, and the weapon was twisted
inward by the fall. Next instant Edmunds,
panting, was standing looking down with
amazement at those long brown fingers still
clutched around the hilt of the dagger, the
blade of which had been crushed into Diego’s
breast by the weight of the other’s body
falling upon him.
“Hell!” exclaimed Edmunds. “The fool
-■-the damned fool!”
He glanced round in bewilderment, then
went to the door and looked out. There was
nobody about. Ugly, stertorous noises began
behind him, .but soon ceased. The insistent
cicada-song in the drowsy peace of the gully
sounded like a sarcasm. He hesitated, doubt-
ful as to what he ought to do. At last he
turned back and stared down at the body
lying still on the floor of the hut. Per-
versely, for a moment, a flash of faith, a
fatalistic sense of inevitable purposes,
seemed to reveal itself in this horrible
sequence to his own words, and involuntarily
he crossed himself—-a thing he had never
in his life done before.
Then his habitual commonsense reasserted
itself; and, reflecting that he could do no
good to anybody by allowing himself to be
mixed up in such an affair, he went off down
the hillside alone the track by which he had
come.
