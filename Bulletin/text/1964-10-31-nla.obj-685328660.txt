“ Whenever I though
of serving an
Australian white wine
/ used to find it difficult
to make a choice
red wines never seem to present
the same problem (Coonawam
Estate is always so good)
until Clifford suggested / try
another ESTA TE wine of Wyn
Modbury Estate.
/ was agreeably surprised —
the 1963 Vintage is superb
for as long as it lasts 1 won y t
be looking elsewhere. ”
There arc six distinct types of Modbury Estate
vhitc table wines: Riesling, Chablis, Hock, White
burgundy, Semilion (Sauternes) and Moselle.
963 is the recommended vintage.

Today you have it!
At the moment you read this, busy
executives throughout the world will be
welcoming the new I.C.T Series 1900.
Here at last is a complete range of
systems that takes all the risks out of
choosing a computer—now, and for
always.
WHY? Because the Series 1900 is
geared to the needs of your organisa-
tion: as your needs expand so does the
1900 system. Expansion is therefore
smooth and your initial investment
stays safe and sound in the years
ahead. You have the widest choice of
systems' available at the most com-
petitive prices, ranging from approxi-
mately £45,000 to over £1,000,000. Rental
terms can also be arranged.
THE 1900 GIVES YOU HIGHER PRO-
DUCTIVITY PER £ INVESTED THAN
ANY OTHER COMPUTER.
NEW FEATURES: Multi-programming
facilities increase up to four times the
productivity of the Series 1900. Other
money-saving features include a com-
plete range of random access and
visual display devices. A built-in Master
programme called Executive finds the
quickest, most economic way of dis-
tributing work load.
The I.C.T standard interface—which
enables all the peripherals to work
with all the processors—is a major
advance in computer techniques.
DELIVERY: The first deliveries of the
1900 system will start within the next
three months. The complete range of
this new I.C.T equipment is currently
being demonstrated at the London
Business Efficiency Fair.

National Notebook
Export Drive
In the past few weeks Sydney art deal-
er, Mr Rudy Komon, has sold Austra-
lian paintings to overseas buyers for a
sum approaching five figures. “On that
basis I think the artists and I should be
eligible for export incentive rebates from
taxation,” Mr Komon said. “If Austra-
lia wants to earn currency overseas it
should be prepared to help its artists as
much as it helps its manufacturers.”
Some of Mr Komon’s recent custom-
ers have been:
• The New York Office of J. Walter
Thompson, which bought a Russell Drys-
dale, “Red Hills”, painted in 1957, for
2500 guineas, as a present for a director
of the company who is retiring. The
Drysdale was the director’s own request.
• Visiting bankers, American David
Rockefeller and Englishman Evelyn de
Rothschild. Mr Rockefeller bought two
Leonard Frenches and a small Dobell oil
of a fish. Mr Rothschild bought Leonard
French’s “The Greek Church” and Drys-
dale’s ‘.‘Sick Child”, a recent painting.
Mr Rothschild bought the Drysdale on
condition that he made it available for a
one-man show which Mr Drysdale will
have, if things go to plan, during the
Commonwealth Festival of Arts in Lon-
don next year. The French will be in-
cluded in Mr French’s exhibition at the
Whitechapel Gallery, London, next year.
• Conductor Rafael Kubelik and his
wife, soprano Elsie Morrison, who
bought a French. Other French buyers
are interior decorator, the Hon John
Siddeley, of London, and Mr Catton
Rich, a trustee of the Guggenheim
Museum.
• The Earl of Hardwick and London
restaurateur, Mr Ken Hall, and the
British High Commissioner in Australia,
Sir William Oliver, who all bought
Dobells.
Lying Low
VUe were warmly welcoming English
" actor Gordon Boyd back to this
country for the musical “Carousel”,
when he whispered: “Psst, not a word to
anyone! I haven't been back to Eng-
land. I’ve been lying low.” Mr Boyd
came here IS months ago for “Wildcat”
for Garnet Carroll. When this folded
he did a television series, called—as he
says, “for want of a better name”—the
“Gordon Boyd Show” and some cabaret.
After that he “lay low” until something
decent came up.
“This, of course, was to maintain my
status as a visiting artist,” Mr Boyd said.
“Once anybody realised I lived here, it
would cut my chances and my salary in
half.”
Mr Boyd does, however, hope to live
here. He has bought a house on Syd-
ney's North Shore. While he “lay low”
there he thought, and now behind the
bright smile and warm voice of Billy
Bigelow at Sydney’s Tivoli lies a burn-
ing ambition to go into politics, to Do
Something About the Australian Enter-
tainment Industry. Mr Boyd is almost
prepared to forsake his Tory principles
and support Labor, because he has seen
signs that Labor has a more benevolent
attitude towards actors.
Most of Mr Boyd’s plans for the
entertainment industry revolve around
films. “You will never get Australian
actors to come back to this country, or
good actors to stay here, without a film
industry,” he said. “It is the only thing
that will make acting economically
feasible.
“And I’m not talking about documen-
taries. If I had my way, there would be
a closed season on Australian documen-
taries for five years, and instead people
would have to make feature films. And
I don’t mean someone getting a few
thousand pounds together and making a
film, then not being able to sell it over-
seas and going bankrupt.
“An Australian film industry has to
have power and money behind it. It has
to be able to follow one film with
another. It has to have a budget big
enough for a consistent publicity pro-
gramme in the United States, Britain, or
wherever the films can be sold. Do you
know that this year Egypt—Egypt, mind
you—is making five full-length films,
with stars such as Albert Finney and
Trevor Howard? If Australia wants to
make full-length films it would cer-
tainly have to get a world star and the
actors would have to use a mid-Atlantic
accent. But even Britain has to make
those concessions to get into the Ameri-
can market.
“An Australian film industry would
have to have Commonwealth Govern-
ment backing, but I can't think of any
way in which the Government could get
a surer return. In migrants. Before
we came here we got all. sorts of pub-
licity material from Australia House,
but we still didn't have any real idea of
what the place was like. But if we'd
seen Australian films, with people in the
their natural setting— not just docu-
mentary shots of the Harbor Bridge—
we'd have known.
“Take the Australian laundry. No-
body overseas knows what an Australian
laundry is like. You could base a whole
migration programme on that one room.
If you only had a shot in a film of an
Australian woman walking into her
laundry and flinging the soiled clothes
into the machine, think what it would
do for migration in England! There you
wake up on Monday, and it's probably
raining. You trundle the washing
machine into the middle of the kitchen,
do your washing and have it hanging
around the house for the rest of the
week.

The Old Hollywood
Tt's always pleasant to hear examples
A of professional modesty, so we felt a
warm glow on learning that Roger
Edens, who produced some of the more
diverting Hollywood musicals, had flown
off to these parts as Ethel Merman’s
pianist. Our pleasure was increased
when we found Mr Edens to be a mir-
acle of youth, spry of face and figure,
and as adroit on the keyboard as he had
—we imagine—been 34 years before,
when he played piano for Miss Merman
in the pit at her Broadway debut in
“Girl Crazy”.
We discovered him playing Irving
Berlin in the desert wastes of the Silver
Spade room, which was looking a trifle
tarnished in the afternoon light. As we
walked up to the suite he occupied, he
flexed his muscular fingers and expressed
delight that we had seen his musical,
“On the Town”, only a few weeks be-
fore, on television. “You know the idea
I had in that picture of getting the par-
ticipants—Gene Kelly, Frank Sinatra,
Betty Garrett and Ann Miller—to act
and sing out a scene on top of the Em-
pire State Building was a development
of something I’d planned back in 1936.
For the ‘Broadway Melody of 1936’, I
had the dancers go out into the streets


SHELL’S WONDERFUL
WORLD OF
CHEMICALS
Nearly every Industry—certainly every major one—relies in some way
on the vast range of chemicals available from Shell. Here are a few highlights
from Shell's widespread field of progress with chemicals from petroleum.
A FANTASTIC PLASTIC
Polypropylene was specified
for this one-piece chair by
a famous designer. This new
thermoplastic is the latest
and lightest yet developed.
No other substance known
has so favourable a combi-
nation of strength, weight,
chemical resistance, rigidity
and resilience as Shell
Polypropylene.

TARGET ON TERMITES
Aldrin and Dieldrin, famous
eradicators of a large
variety of insects that rav-
age agriculture and indus-
try, have been developed
for an all-out war against
termites in all building
constructions. Expertly ap-
plied as a “soil barrier” in
existing or new buildings,
they prevent white ants
from getting to their fav-
ourite meal.
“EPIKOTE” GOES UNDERSEA
Shell Chemical engineers
have developed and proved
a new “Epikote” resin com-
pound that can be applied
underwater to protect steel
hulls, piers, bridges, etc.,
from sea water corrosion.
The new substance out-
lasts and outprotects even
special corrosion-resistant
metal sheathing. Yet it is
approximately one quarter

• 0 f the city. Up till then there had been
a tendency for everybody to play in
studio sets.” But most people, he sug-
gested, tended to sing when they were
free, happy, and out of doors.
Was it true, we asked, that he had
had something to do with the discovery
. 0 f Judy Garland? “Oh yes, indeed. I
can remember distinctly when she came
in to Metro for her first audition. The
child was so obviously unhappy. She
was the ugliest little creature, in an un-
attractive middy blouse. Her mother
sat down to play the piano, rather badly
tas I recall. I heard the little girl sing
‘Zing went the strings of my heart’,
j Wham! Two minutes later I was in
Louis Mayer’s office telling him to sign
her. He came right down. He knew
t straight away. He told the casting office
[to issue a contract.”
j Later, Mr Edens had written “Dear
'Mr Gable” for her to sing to the studio’s
reigning pithecanthropus at a celebrated
birthday party. And repeated in one of
the “Broadway Melodies” it had helped
to make her a star. Talking of those
days inevitably brought a nostalgic
gleam to Mr Edens’ eye, and we asked
fhim, knowing the answer in advance,
iwhat had gone out of Hollywood. “In
those days there was a tremendous feel-
ing of energy and excitement. People
speak against Louis B. Mayer but in fact
he gave us all an extraordinary degree
of freedom. If you were an artist, and
he recognised artists, you were left
alone. But once everything passed into
'the hands of the New York bankers
dhere was no more chance for freedom.
'Nowadays a really creative man like
Selznick can’t set up a picture and a
banker like Joe Levine—not an artist
at all—makes the hits,
i “No, I wouldn’t put the beginning of
>the decline in musicals to the rise of
television. I’d locate it exactly in the
period when ‘The King and I’-was re-
leased in Europe. Suddenly we began
to realise that European audiences didn't
want to hear American songs any more.
They wanted to hear their own songs.
we began to lose the overseas audi-
'ence.
, “And the decline in quality has come
with the fabulously increased costs in
Hollywood. It used to cost 25,000 dol-
lars a day to make a picture. Now it’s
50,000 dollars. On ‘Singing in the Rain’
had a 10-week rehearsal. We
''couldn’t do that now.”
We asked Mr Edens what stars today
could both command an audience and
successfully dominate a musical. For a
hffle, he cogitated, looking sad. “We-eIT
Jt’s a tough one. Debbie Reynolds,
e an Martin, Sinatra still, and Julie
Andrews since Disney took a gamble and
s hrred her in three pictures in a row.
And that’s all.” .
L With so few stars, what would Mr
ydens see as the future course to save
Hollywood from extinction? “We all
feel that pay television will open up an
enormous industry. Once a year before
Christmas Day Metro puts on ‘The
Wizard of Oz’. We learned that 65 mil-
lion people saw the last performance of
that picture. Seventeen million sets
were in use. Now when you have pay
television you each pay, say, one dollar
per set to see a new movie. So you see
that means 17 million dollars in one
night’s performance alone. If we can
swing it, we will have to produce pic-
tures on an enormous scale to keep up
with the demand. And the payments
from the sets will more than meet our
costs.” And Mr Edens, looking from
the past to the future, had an expectant
gleam in his eye.
Ballerina s Baby
could be more nerve-wrecking
to a ballet company than to learn
that one of the prima ballerinas is preg-
nant? But love waits for no management.
Marilyn Jones, of the Australian Ballet,
which began a seven-week season in
Melbourne last Friday, is to have a
baby and will leave the company in a
month or so.
She is the wife of Garth Welch, the
company’s leading male dancer. In the
Melbourne season, she is sharing with
Kathy Gorham the role of Giselle, and
dancing the Princess in “Aurora’s Wed-
ding”.
When we telephoned the Melbourne
office of the Elizabethan Theatre. Trust,
a spokesman for the ballet company
confirmed our news of the baby, but
added that the company’s administrator,
Mr Geoffrev Ingram had tabooed all
Press interviews.
The necessity for Marilyn Jones to
leave the company before the end of
the new season could prove a bit of good
news for Elaine Fifield, who has made
a comeback to ballet after four years
on a New Guinea copra plantation as
the wife of Mr Leslie Farley. Miss
Fifield has not been given quite the
same size type in the advertisements for
the Melbourne season as have Miss
Gorham and Miss Jones.

ADVICE TO EXPATRIATES
feuLletin
80 Years Ago: October 25, 1884
A new paper has been started in
London for the purpose of sup-
plying our friends at home with infor-
mation as to which part of Mada-
gascar Australia is in, whether there
is postal communication between
Sydney and New South Wales, and a
census of the population not living in
bark huts. This is a very worthy pur-
pose, and one that, if carried out,
would, no doubt, do the colonies a
great deal of good if our members
of Parliament would only stay here
and look after their business, instead
of going to England and giving away
the whole game. While this goes on it
is impossible to remove the idea which
prevails in many English circles that
our highest society intermingles and
intermarries with the blacks. We think
a law should be passed providing that
no person representing himself as a
prominent person in political, profes-
sional, or social life in the colonies
should be allowed to go to Europe
until he had passed an examination in
English grammar and given sufficient
guarantees that while he was away
he would clean his teeth and nails
regularly and not use hair-oil when
he was going to a ball. If this course
of conduct were adopted, Australians
might, in time, be able to converse in
London drawing-rooms without the
usual criticism after they were gone
that they were remarkably intelligent
for savages.

Australia and the Chinese Bomb
Uor Australians the Chinese ex-
-*■ plosion of an atomic “device”
with the power of the bomb that
obliterated Hiroshima—raises one of
the gravest defence questions we have
ever had to face, especially when
linked with the policy of the new
British Prime Minister of scrapping
the independent British deterrent.
The Chinese bomb is a far more
ominous development than the French
bomb. France no longer has imperialist
designs and no country has any
occasion to fear a French attack: no
one in Switzerland or Italy or Spain
reacted to President de Gaulle’s bomb
by demanding independent nuclear
deterrents to safeguard their countries
from the French. But China has pro-
claimed to the world its designs on
India and Indo-China and is engaged
in war against countries further south.
Even without nuclear bombs, it had
reason to be optimistic; now it may
even feel confident of spreading its
empire at least to the shores of Aus-
tralia.
For the time being it has only the
bomb, which is comparatively useless
without both a stockpile and a delivery
system. But it is only a matter of time
before it develops these, and the value
of this breathing space can be easily
overstated. (As Professor Titterton
points out in his important article on
page 21, Red China is not impotent
without a delivery system. “Nuclear
bombs are small and can be broken
down into parts to be smuggled into
a country and assembled clandestinely
to await firing at an appropriate time.
Nor is it impossible, in the appropriate
areas, for a tramp steamer, or for that
matter a Chinese junk, to enter a
chosen harbor carrying a nuclear
bomb. Such suggestions may seem
far-fetched but they will have to be
considered.”)
Since, at the same time, Mr Harold
Wilson is committed to scrapping the
British deterrent (so that, as Mr W. C.
Wentworth put it last week, whereas
Australia once had two great and
powerful friends, we may now have
°niy one), Australians are committed
1° the sort of realistic reconsideration
°f °ur defences that is also engaging
Indians. Translating Gaullism into
Indian terms, they are asking them-
selves how any country can remain
non-aligned if it does not have a
nuclear deterrent.
For 10 years India has been ex-
panding its nuclear facilities so that,
according to Dr Bhabha, director-
general of India’s Atomic Energy
Commission, it could produce a
nuclear bomb within 18 months, and
the influential Calcutta “Statesman” is
advocating that India consider pre-
cisely this —an indication of how
deeply the Chinese bomb has shaken
the land of Jawaharlal Nehru. Despite
some opposition within India, it still
seems probable that India will be the
next nation to explode a nuclear
bomb. Quoting General de Gaulle, the
“Statesman” says the only reliable
deterrent is one’s own. (See story, page
40.)
No one would gladly see Australia
enter this nuclear race either by buy-
ing atomic weapons from our allies or
by building for ourselves a nuclear
stockpile of sufficient strength to en-
able us, despite our small population,
to deter any invaders. But in the light
of the changing balance of world
power we must now consider this
possibility, even if in the end we find
preferable ways of guaranteeing our
independence. At least we should put
ourselves in the position of countries
like Israel, India, Sweden, Italy and
Switzerland of being technically able,
in an emergency, to produce the
weapons we may need.
This is not a pleasant prospect, but
it is nevertheless a situation that
countries like Sweden, Israel and India
have learnt to live with countries
which may increasingly have to be our
models.
State Aid Without State Control
\\Then the Anglican Synod in Sydney
" recently rejected the Federal
Government’s proposals for aid to
independent schools, one of the telling
arguments apart from the usual
appeals to prejudice against Catholic
schools was that State Aid would
inevitably mean increased State Con-
trol. This is not a worthless argument
and should be faced.
In the current issue of the Mel-
bourne Socialist magazine “Dissent”,
however, Mr Alan Barcan of the New-
castle Teachers’ College, recommends
a system of State Aid which may
overcome this problem, and deserves
wide discussion.
“Let the Commonwealth Govern-
ment,” he writes, “together with State
and local governments, grant aid to
private and State schools which
possess governing bodies, provided
these governing bodies are democratic
in the sense that the majority of their
members are made up of teachers em-
ployed in the school. These school
councils, boards of trustees, senates,
governors, or what you will, should
consist of, say, 50 per cent representa-
tion of teachers actually teaching in
the school. Parents, too, should be
represented, as also the State and
Commonwealth Governments. Con-
veniently placed tertiary educational
institutions (universities, teachers’ col-
leges, or technical colleges) might also
frequently be represented. If these
independent schools prefer to have a
religious coloration this should be
accepted; but they should be open to
all. To counter the argument that
this policy would mean support for
exclusive “elite” schools, one require-
ment should be that aided schools
which charged fees should offer a
number of free places obtainable by
means of scholarships.”
The point of this proposal is that
it would turn State Aid into an instru-
ment to encourage genuinely indepen-
dent schools. If adopted it would
mean that State moneys would not go
to the churches, but to the indepen-
dent bodies governing church schools
—and presumably they would not be
entitled to the money unless they
could prove their independence. His
suggestion would also involve the
reform of State school administration,
as well as that of some church schools,
which would certainly be welcomed by
teachers in both types of school as
well as by the laity in church schools.
The Barcan proposal also has some
traditional claim: It is the system
which was applied in New South
Wales to Sydney Grammar School and
Sydney University in the nineteenth
century.


THIS AUSTRALIA
Will Menzies Lose Control?
SIR ROBERT MENZIES
GEORGE COLE
ARTHUR CALWELL
FROM ALAN REID IN CANBERRA
T>oth the Menzies Government and
** the ALP are in trouble over
the Senate elections. Labor's troubles
are financial. The Government’s troubles
are more serious. They are political. To
maintain its present freedom of political
action the Government has to maintain,
in addition to its majority in the House
of Representatives, a majority in the
Senate. It has the Senate and will con-
tinue to have it until June 30 next when
the new Senators elected on December
5 will take their seats.
Of the 60 Senators in until June 30
next, 31 are Government supporters, 27
are ALP, one is DLP —Senator Cole of
Tasmania and one is Independent
Senator Turnbull, also of Tasmania.
Thirty of the 60 Senators are retiring
this time. They consist of 15 Government
supporters, 14 ALP and the solitary DLP
Parliamentarian, Senator George Cole.
Each of the six Australian States elect
five Senators. This means that to main-
tain its majority the Menzies Govern-
ment has to win and thereby get three
Senate seats in any three States.
A few months ago it looked as though
the Menzies Government would win in a
canter. It looked a certainty to win Vic-
toria, Queensland and Western Australia
and had a show in NSW. But the picture
has changed since then quite dramati-
cally. The Government moved off-balance
with the Voyager sinking, which had the
effect of directing public attention to
shortcomings in the Government’s de-
fence measures. Every time it tried to
get back on balance it has stumbled
afresh. It bought into what seems a need-
less and premature brawl over airlines
allocations in NSW and its major ally
and sheet anchor the Bolte Liberal
Government in Victoria has turned in
an even more pitiful performance, where-
as earlier this year Bolte was riding high,
wide and handsome, with an overall
majority in the Lower House, newly
given him by the electors, and control of
the Upper House. In his own right
Bolte’s public image is such that on
paper, at least, he looks more like a
liability than an asset to his Federal
Liberal associates.
The Federal Liberals’ own mistiming
undoubtedly contributed to Bolte’s plight.
When the Menzies Government decided
only days before the by-election which
lost Bolte control over the Victorian
Upper House not to co-operate with
Victoria in the collection of Victorian
State income tax proposed by Bolte in
his Budget and the decision “leaked”, the
decision probably cost Bolte any chance
he might have had otherwise of taking
out this vital by-election. But Bolte’s
antics since can hardly be described as
helping his own or his Federal associates’
cause. Forgetting all about his claim
that within the limits imposed by Com-
monwealth grants States are sovereign,
he first of all accused Deputy Prime
Minister and Federal Country Party
leader John McEwen of telling him at
a Premiers’ Conference to go back to
Victoria and raise freight fares and
other charges.
When McEwen would not wear that
one Bolte turned round and said that if
it was not McEwen who told him that,
then it was his fellow Liberal Harold
Holt speaking as Federal Treasurer, or
some Federal Treasury official. These
constant shifts of ground can hardly im-
prove the Bolte image in the eyes of
Victorian voters and as Bolte is identic
tied closely with the Liberal cause ini
that State the Federal Liberals, includ-
ing the Prime Minister Sir Robert
Menzies, are understandably worried
about the effect upon the general Liberal
image practically on the eve of a Senate
election. The Bolte contretemps is un-
doubtedly spilling over into other States'
and could have a psychological effect)
upon voters, particularly in NSW where
Labor Premier John Renshaw, who has
a State election coming up, is shrewdly
exploiting weaknesses in the civil avia-
tion brawl. As Mr McEwen and hisj
Federal Deputy-Leader Charley Ader-
mann have shown by their acceptance of
the Commonwealth decision, and the
ALP has repeatedly stated, the Common]
wealth has a respectable case for taking
full control of civil aviation in Australia,!
But the issue could not have been worse
handled if the Commonwealth were out
to discredit the case for Commonwealth
control rather than to justify it.
A Government always has difficulty in
winning a Senate election. Because the
outcome does not mean the replacement
of one Prime Minister and his Govern-
ment with the alternative Prime Minister,
and a new Government, Senate elections
held separately as the December 5r
Senate elections will be from House of
Representatives elections, seem to have
in Australian voters' eyes only the status
of a by-election. Those with grievances,
grumbles or frustrations, vote against
the Government, not to turn it out but
to register a protest. >
When the Victorian and NSW de-
velopments are added to these attitudes'
it can be seen that the Government has
its task in front of it, unless it can turn
the fight into an ideological one instead
of a straight judgment upon the Govern-
ment's recent record and activities. Bun
the ALP also has its difficulties. As the
Opposition Leader Mr Calwell told
Caucus last week there is no money
coming in. If there is any feeling
against the Menzies Government it is
not being balanced by corresponding
support for the Labor Party.
will be fighting the election on a very-
tight budget. Mr Calwell warned thi
Caucus that the unions would not bt
“kicking the tin” to any significant ex-
tent. At the moment most of them are
contributing to support of the GM-H
strike and even if that folds up over-
night they will have exhausted much oh
their giving capacity. On top of that
and with State elections coming in NSW ;
State ALP machines are prudently try-
ing to reserve some funds to fight their
own campaigns.
The extent of Labor's financial plight
can be gauged from Mr Calwell's noti-
fication to Caucus that Labor would be
spending very little on commercial TV-
It will be relying almost exclusively

From Hardware stores everywhere t.is
its TV campaign upon the free time that
the ABC is obliged to give all political
parties at election times. Herein lies
the ALP weakness.
If the Senate election fight shifts back
on to ideological issues and with the
position in South-East Asia touchy and
capable of producing a situation in which
national interests may dwarf relatively
minor domestic differences—the ALP
could find itself inadequately equipped
and organised to counter a Government
propaganda blast mainly directed against
the ALP’s ideological and leadership
shortcomings. To this extent it is to
Labor’s advantage that the campaign
will be short between the time the
Leaders give their policy speeches
Menzies on November 19 and Calwell
on November 20—and electors go to the
polls a fortnight later,
For both parties it is an uneasy time,
with Labor having the advantage that,
already being in a minority in the Senate,
it has nothing to lose while the Govern-
ment which has control of both Houses
of the Federal Parliament at the moment
has quite a significant stake, including
its prestige involved in the outcome of
the December 5 Senate election.
LAW
The Tax Racket
FROM J. C. HORSFALL IN MELBOURNE
The Federal Treasurer, Mr H. Holt,
-*• dropped a bombshell into the com-
pany world last week with his proposals
for taxation reform, the first major ones
for nearly 30 years. It was thought they
would follow closely the lines suggested
by the Ligertwood Committee on Taxa-
tion which reported in 1961, but they
turned out to be much more thorough in
most respects, and in some cases de-
SIR GEORGE LIGERTWOOD
parted sharply from the Ligertwood re-
commendations.
Originally it was thought that the
implementation of the Ligertwood pro-
posals would make the Treasury about
£l4 million better off a year by stop-
ping up avenues of tax avoidance through
private companies, trusts and lease
arrangements, abuse of superannuation
fund exemptions and so on. Now this
sum should be substantially exceeded be-
cause the Government has decided to
make it virtually impossible for com-
panies to benefit, taxwise, from the pur-
chase of tax losses in other companies.
In the very' broadest terms it is pro-
posed that, in future, losses of a previ-
ous year will not be allowed as deduc-
tions against the income of a year of
any company unless there is found to
be, during both years, a beneficial owner-
ship by the same shareholders of shares
in the company that carry at least 40
per cent of the voting and dividend
rights and 40 per cent of entitlement to
distributions of capital in the event of the
company being wound up or reducing its
capital.
Many companies which had bought
tax loss companies in the last few years
and still haven’t exhausted the benefits
were stunned by the latter proposal which
is a complete reversal of the Ligertwood
finding that “in the light of our view of
a company as a legal entity separate
from its shareholders, we think that a
company’s losses should be treated for
fiscal purposes without regard to the
identity of its shareholders”. Under the
Bill any company still with unexhausted
tax losses purchased from other com-
panies will have to use them up in the
current year or else forfeit them.
While the Government will strike some
heavy opposition from its back benchers
on this proposal, if only because of its
virtually retrospective effect, a number of
companies with tax losses to sell looked
even more friendless than usual after the
contents of the Bill were known.
Even if the public generally are un-
likely to see any objection to stopping
the tax loss racket, Mr Holt will certainly
be taken to task by company lawyers for
confusion of principles.
On the other hand company lawyers
will see merit in his proposal to adopt
entirely new definitions for public and
private companies which follow, except
in one important respect, the Ligert-
wood recommendation. The point is
that the Ligertwood Committee found
the definition of a private company
wholly unsatisfactory and decided the
best course was to make a firmer defini-
tion of a public company and call all
others private ones. So the Treasurer’s
proposal is that all companies will be
deemed private unless the ordinary
shares issued by a company are, at the
end of the relevant year of income, listed
on a stock exchange, and if throughout
the year 20 or fewer persons did not
own three-fourths (the Ligertwood Com-
mittee recommended it be two-thirds) of
the paid capital other than preferred
capital, or did not control three-fourths
of the voting power, or would not be
entitled to three-fourths of distributions
made by the company.
But even in setting up this dichotomy
the Government has allowed the Tax
Commissioner discretion in classifying
companies in appropriate cases. Indeed
this discretionary power is also written
deeply into most of the other clauses of
the Bill and this may be the measure’s
biggest weakness —the arbitrary discre-
tion given to the Commission.

The Last
Hanging?
FROM A PERTH CORRESPONDENT
Edgar Cooke, WA’s most hated
man, was hanged on Monday,
October 26, amid a cloud of doubt. He
went to the gallows for the murder of a
youth and is known to have killed four
other people. Two more narrowly
escaped death at his hands during his
long reign of terror that included shoot-
ings, a stabbing and a strangling. The
doubt is not over these outrages, but (a)
whether Cooke was sane, and (b) whether
a deaf-and-dumb man is serving a life
term for a murder Cooke claimed he
also committed.
The WA Labor Opposition has in-
creased the doubt by urging a retrial of
the man, Darryl Beamish (23), despite
the fact that Cooke’s “confession” to this
murder was rejected by the Court of

Criminal Appeal and the High Court of
Australia when Beamish appealed. This
case was the sex murder of wealthy
young socialite Jilian Brewer. Cooke
also “confessed” to another killing and
a subsequent appeal by a youth serving
a term for this crime was also rejected.
The appeal judges told Cooke they were
satisfied his stories were tissues of lies
and that justice had been done.
The Director of Mental Health Ser-
vices gave evidence at Cooke’s trial that
the pint-size killer was sane, though he
suffered character abnormalities. How-
ever, a newspaper survey among Perth
psychiatrists showed that most are not
happy with this opinion. One thing is
quite clear: most WA people (70 per
cent, on one survey) wanted Cooke
executed. They remember the many
months of fear before he was trapped
by detectives. His father refused to
visit him in gaol and his mother said:
“The sooner my son is dead the better
for all concerned. Eric’s main ambition
in life was always to be the perfect
criminal Little Ned Kelly, I called
him.” She said his confessions to the
killings the youth and Beamish were con-
victed for showed his criminal cunning
in prolonging his life.
But a poignant note was struck by
Cooke's wife, who was continuing to
show her husband photographs of their
six children until the hangman cut short
her daily visits. The children, aged from
three to nine years, think he is sick in
hospital and neighbors, shopkeepers and
schoolmates preserved a conspiracy of
silence for the 12 months Cooke was
in Fremantle Gaol. “Eric was always
a good, kind father.” said Mrs Cooke.

it neared its close was a strong move to
end the death penalty in WA after
Cooke had gone, of course. Many
people are sensitive about WA’s reputa-
tion as the hanging State: four hang-
ings since 1959 with Cooke’s. Labor
is traditionally against capital punish-
ment but has carefully avoided aboli-
tion during its terms in office.
Now three members of the Liberal
Party who are not in Parliament are
reported to be threatening to stand
against endorsed Liberal candidates as
independents at the next State election
unless the Government abolishes the gal-
lows. Cooke’s execution could well be
the last time the ghastly ritual is enacted
in the West.
RELIGION
God and
the State
FROM GIRDON CHESTERMAN IN SYDNEY
month a Western Australian
inter-Church committee (compris-
ing representatives of the Catholic,
Anglican, Presbyterian and Methodist
Churches) will investigate the decline of
religion in State schools. Two proposals
will be considered:
• The introduction of religious
specialist teachers. (Under this envisaged
set-up the religious instructor would not
be a casual weekly visitor merely
tolerated, but an accepted part of the
school organism. The status of such an
instructor would be the same as that of
any other specialised teacher.)
• Or the possible abandoning of re-
ligious instruction altogether, and allow-
ing concentrated instructional classes
outside school time and away from the
school itself.
Basis for the investigation is a report
by the Rev. B. R. Adderley, of St Pat-
rick's Cathedral, Bunbury, Western Aus-
tralia. The report is an amplification of
a proposal for religious specialist teach-
ers made by him last year and since
adopted by all the Diocesan synods of
the Anglican Church in Western Aus-
tralia.
Mr Adderley in his report said:
“Christ is absent from the classrooms of
State schools except for the regulation
half hour once a week, during which
well meaning but often ill-prepared in-
structors deal with a sometimes hostile
and nearly always indifferent segment
of the future citizenry. Children will be-
come more secularised in outlook and
more indifferent to Christian values un-
less a revolution is effected in their
education.’' He felt that nothing would
be attempted in this field by the State
without unremitting and probably mis-
understood pressure from the Churches.
It was strange that in Australia there
had been so little questioning of the
State’s assumption of the direction of
education (as distinct from its mere en-
forcement). He quoted J. S. Mill: “A
general State education is a mere con-
trivance for moulding people to be exact-
ly like one another; and as the mould
in which it casts is that which pleases
the predominant power in the Govern-
ment ... it establishes a despotism over
the mind leading by natural tendency
to one over the body. An education
established and controlled by the State
should only exist, if it exists at all, as
one among many competing experi-
ments carried on for the purpose of
example and stimulus.”
Rarely, said Mr Adderley, had any-
one in the interests of a free society
criticised State-controlled education as
being what it was in fact socialised '
education. Monopolies, be they private
or State, were criticised in the industrial
sphere as major curtailers of the liberty
of the small man the small organis-
ation. Apparently they had lost their
danger in the educational world.
“What is needed is an aroused and
informed public opinion on the matter,
for the Government policy on education •
can and ought to be formed by the elec-
tors,” he said.
If the educational authorities claimed
that they can only operate within the
framework of the State Education Act,
what must be done is to change that
Act to provide for radical rethinking
on the problem of religious instruction i
in schools, he said.

CENSORSHIP
Freedom to Read
FROM A MELBOURNE CORRESPONDENT
rpuE Victorian Freedom to Read Asso-
ciation, concerned at the Federal
Government’s proposal to introduce uni-
form literary censorship throughout
Australia, has submitted its views on
censorship reform in a letter to The Min-
ister for Customs, Senator K. M. Ander-
son.
In summary, these are:
1. The definition of obscenity The
Association believes that the present
definition of obscenity, used by both
Commonwealth and State authorities,
which is derived from a rule laid down
by Mr Justice Cockburn in 1868, is out-
moded and unduly restrictive. It urges
that, in any new legislation, obscenity
be defined in these terms: “A publication
is obscene if its sole appeal, considering
the work as a whole, is to prurient
interest.”
2. The procedure against obscene
publications The Association believes
that the procedures adopted in the case
of allegations of obscene publication
should be amended to incorporate two
principles which the law does not at
present recognise: that, in the first in-
stance, action should be directed against
the publication rather than the author,
publisher, or distributor, and that cer-
tain defences should be available which
are not at present available. A procedure
along these lines would satisfy these
proposals:
(a) That a publication may be declared
obscene if, in the opinion of the appro-
priate tribunal, it falls within the above
definition.
(b) That any person whether Govern-
ment official or private citizen) may
apply to any Justice of the Supreme
Court of the ACT or of any State for
an interim order to prohibit the distribu-
tion of the work complained of, which
order may be made on the complainant
establishing a prima facie case that the
work is obscene.
(c) That the interim order should set
a date, which should provide adequate
time for the entering of defences, for the
hearing by the appropriate tribunal of
an application for a permanent order to
prohibit distribution.
(d) That public notice should be given
of the hearing of this application, and
that interested parties (including author,
publisher, booksellers, and organisations
or individuals who can establish their
interest) should be entitled to enter de-
fences.
(e) That in considering such an appli-
cation, the tribunal should consider the
interest of the work to normal adults.
(f) That the defence should be entitled
to call expert evidence as to the inten-
tion of the author of the work and
the interests to which it might appeal.
(g) That an appeal from the tribunal’s
decision should lie on questions of law
but not of fact.
(h) That where a permanent order is
made against any work, provision should
be made for the tribunal to grant special
permits for the acquisition of individual
copies, on the application of libraries or
of individuals with a professional interest
in the work concerned.
(i) That penalties should be provided
for persons distributing any work against
which an order has been made.
3. The tribunal The Association
also believes that an appropriate com-
position of a tribunal to consider appli-
cations for permanent orders of prohibi-
tion would be: a Justice of the Supreme
Court as chairman, and four other mem-
bers chosen for their expert literary
knowledge and appointed by the Gov-
ernor in Council.

ADVERTISING
Foreign Agents
From a Melbourne Correspondent
Taking his cue from the question,
“How much of Australia is up for
'sale and at what price?” (posed by Dr
Malcolm Mackay in The Bulletin,
September 19), Mr John Jackson of
Jackson Wain Pty Ltd, Sydney, told the
Advertising Agencies Convention in
1 Melbourne: “We should not fear the
( prospect of good overseas agencies from
'anywhere coming here to compete for
| opportunities in this market.” His
jeason for this was confidence in the
ability of locally owned agencies meet-
ing this competition as successfully as
[ before.
| Although Mr Jackson had a feeling of
disappointment that so many large
agencies here “have not been sufficiently
self-confident to retain independence”, he
said he was not looking for a closed
shop in the advertising agency business.
On the contrary he welcomes foreign
agencies, who, as in the case of J. Walter
years ago, are willing to take
, the financial risks of opening here en-
-1 tirely by their own resources and re-
sourcefulness.
The factor not to be overlooked is
quality. “When the mergers or take-
overs are completed, when all the re-
search is over and done, when the com-
puterised media schedules are finished,
• when the marketing reports are stapled
in their blue or morocco leather covers,
it is still the magic words of the copy-
writers which sell the product,” he said.
CRICKET
Indian Summer
BY DISCUS
When the Australian XI arrived in
T India a month ago, Ray Steele pro-
mised bright cricket and Bob Simpson
said the Australians were not tired after
their long English tour and would find
the Indian climate similar to Australia’s
in summer.
These statements dispose of some of
the reasons which have been offered for
India’s good showing in the recent Test
series. A few years ago both India and
Pakistan were being regarded as second
c iass teams in international cricket.
Tests against England and Australia
have proved that assessment out of date.
If the Indians had anything working
I°r them it was Australia’s shortage of
s Pjn bowlers. Time and again India’s
spinners wrecked the batting, in one
distance dismissing our last five batsmen
I°r 20 runs.
In the first innings of the Second Test
India’s Bth, 9th, and 10th batsmen
scored 78, while our three made 17.
In the second innings India's spinners
took our last five wickets for 20 runs.
On a spinner’s pitch, but that’s cricket.
Australia added left-hander Cowper to
help offset India’s left-hand spinners,
but in the first innings of the Third
Test spinner Durrani took the wickets
of Lawry, Cowper and Veivers, all left-
handers, and three others as well, for
73 runs. Our last five wickets went
for a grand total of 3 runs. Only
Lawry, Simpson and Redpath scored
double figures. India had five batsmen
in double figures, including two of the
last five in their batting order,
Over a Test series these statistics must
suggest either a weak or tired Australia,
or a stronger India,
Australia has dominated the world of
cricket for seven or eight years. It is
a healthy change to see India challenge
this supremacy. If the improvement
extends to Pakistan we may see a vigor-
ous match or two when that team
pauses on the way to New Zealand this
summer, to play what may be the first
of the short tours.


Around Melbourne
THERE'S A WHISPERING WAR UP THERE
rFouGHENED aviation correspondents
believe we have just witnessed the
finest air battle since the Sabre-MIG
contests of the Korean War. Accord-
ing to one of the TAA air-marshals,
the battle need never have occurred.
Originally the idea was for one
Boeing 727 to come into Sydney and
for the other to head straight for Mel-
bourne. “Well,” said this air-mar-
shal, “we waited for Ansett’s to do
something and they didn’t, so we
chose Melbourne. Next we knew they
were coming in to Melbourne, too.”
An Ansett-ANA air-marshal on the
other hand said they were the first
to order the 7275, yet TAA’s Boeing
was first off the production line by
three weeks. Then the rush was on.
It was only because the Ansett crew
already had done their simulator train-
ing in Melbourne, whereas TAA’s
crew did theirs in the US, that they
were able to make up the three weeks
lag. Anyway their executives tossed
a coin on the choice of cities.
As you know, TAA and Reg
Ansett tossed a coin on the point as
to who would land first at Essendon
and Reg won. It was a terrible
occasion for us non-combatants. In-
vitations arrived from both com-
panies to attend the arrival at the
same time on the Friday afternoon.
One couldn’t accept both. So here
once and for all loyalties were settled
in Melbourne. “Were you for Reg
or were you for TAA?”
There’s no question that Reg won
the first little publicity skirmish. When
their 727 landed, TAA took it away
into a hangar and had speeches. Lady
Chippindall smashed a bottle of
champagne across its bows and
formally named it the James Cook.
However, Reg Ansett doesn’t go in
for any of this sentimental nonsense
of naming aircraft. The only speech
he made contained the rather wistful
point that he had bought all Aus-
tralian National Airways with its
aircraft fleet, ground installations,
spanners and what not for £3.3 mil-
lion. Now for just one aeroplane
with its spares he had paid £3.5
million.
So while TAA was having cere-
monies, Mr Ansett didn’t hesitate.
Within 30 minutes he had his
anonymous aeroplane up in the air
giving trips to newspapermen. For
the next day both air forces had
planned their proving flights around
Australia and both had flown in
Pressmen from the other cities.
Actually TAA planned their round-
Australia flight four months ago and
every effort was made to keep it
“top mum”—a phrase coined by the
English comic strip character Colonel
Pewter. Indeed that was the way it
remained until somehow the news
leaked out from Perth 10 days before
B-day.
Ansett-ANA, on the other hand,
decided to do nothing until TAA
showed their hand. They learned that
TAA intended to go to Adelaide to
Perth and then from Perth on a
direct flight to Brisbane; stop over-
night there and continue through to
Sydney and Canberra. In every city
they would have demonstration
flights plus fashion parades by the
Wool Board.
Do Ansett-ANA waited until the
TAA invitations were out and ac-
cepted, then made their move. Instead
of a two-day tour they decided to
do the capitals in one day, starting
at 6 a.m. and finishing after 10 at
night, 6000 miles in 10 hours flying
time. This meant that Reg was first
into every capital except Adelaide
and Canberra. He missed out on the
Adelaide first because he flew from
Melbourne direct to Perth and picked
up Adelaide on the way back and
why waste time on Canberra? That
wasn’t a 727 city.
TAA claim that with their more
leisurely approach they were seen by
more people. What's more, they felt
that their slogan “The Whispering
T-Jet” had a real edge on the dull
Ansett-ANA “Fan Jet” theme. Be
that as it may—you must understand
it is always most difficult to assess
rival claims in wartime.
Your correspondent actually did
fly in the Ansett-ANA tour. The
unconfirmed report is that the round-
Australia trip cost Mr Ansett £lO,OOO.
The most interesting experiment con-
ducted by the aviation correspondents
was the balancing of the beer bottles.
At 31,000 feet they made a column
of four bottles on top of each other
placed neck to neck, an exercise that
put the Boeing experts aboard into
raptures. They thought it a most
interesting Australian experiment.
Meanwhile all that was done aboard
the James Cook was a mere balancing
of a penny on its edge.
As I am used to very old-fashioned
propeller aeroplanes, I found a num-
ber of things disturbing. It is possible
to hear noise only in the back three
or four rows, reserved for tourist
class, naturally. Up front it is im-
possible to hear the engines start and
there’s not a sound beyond airflow
noises even at take-off. According
to the pilots, they have to tell by
lights that the engines have started.
What’s more, if they lose an engine
in flight there’s no movement in the
aeroplane at all, no violent swing.
And they need a light to tell them
they’ve lost an engine. Another
difference from normal jets is the
great weight down aft. They need to
approach with a good deal of power
or there’s likely to be a splurge on
landing.
Actually, for an old-fashioned type,
it’s a comfort to hear engines to know
that they’re there. And if you’re
used to the old style of take-off you
need to be prepared for the Boeing.
It is usually 800 feet up by the end
of the runway and rising at just on
6000 feet a minute. The angle of
climb is unbelievable, looking up the
aisle of the aircraft is like looking
up the steps of St Peter’s.
However, Mr Ansett got us back
home very safely. And, by the way,
Ansett-ANA have now secured the
Melbourne PO Box Number 727.
Just another little publicity battle
they’ve won.

No Gentlemen’s Agreement
Should Australia have a stockpile?
LIU SHAO-CHI and MAO TSE-TUNG
By E. W. TITTERTON
(Professor of Nuclear Physics, Australian National University)
Since the realisation by the three
major nuclear powers—Britain, the
USA and the USSR, especially the
last-named that all-out nuclear war
is unthinkable, a sort of gentleman’s
agreement has grown up among them.
This shows itself through their deter-
mination to do nothing which would
encourage or help other nations to
acquire nuclear weapons for themselves.
The possibility of the spread of nuclear
bombs to many nations the so-called
n-th nation problem has worried the
big three because they fear that small
nations might use such weapons
irresponsibly or that there could be a
mistake or accident which would
initiate nuclear warfare and which could
escalate into a world-wide conflagration.
rpi. . . r i
The strength of this policy can be
gauged from the facts that, much tc. the
chagrin of General De Gaulle the USA
and Britain were not prepared to give
information to France on nuclear
weapons, while on their side the Soviet
Union withdrew its technical aid from
e !na ' .
As is well known, France decided to
go it alone. She developed and tested
nuclear bombs and is now busily stock -
piling them to establish an effective
strike force. Furthermore, in the next
year or so France will test her first high
yield (megaton) bombs in the Pacific
and will then be a fully-fledged mem-
ber of the nuclear club. Now we have a
similar situation developing in the Red
Chinese case. Without help from the
Russians they have assembled and sue-
cessfully tested - a nuclear weapon.
The entry of China into this field will
have much greater effects than in the
case of France. France is one of the
oldest technological civilisations, with
wisdom in international affairs, and she
threatens no-one with her nuclear
weapons. From the outset, Paris has
made it clear that French nuclear capa-
bility was aimed at ensuring an effective
French defence; there were no overtones
of aggression. This was widely accepted
and there were no serious repercussions
thus neither Switzerland, Italy, Spain
nor even West Germany regarded
French possession of nuclear bombs as
a threat to them. But this is not the case
with Red China. In recent years China
has exerted herself militarily against
neighboring territories notably in
the adventure against India.
This changes the situation, especially
in South-East Asia and India, very con-
siderably. Since the debacle against
Chinese forces in the north, India has
been doing everything possible to
strengthen her defences. But now she
has to re-examine the situation and de-
cide whether to make nuclear weapons
for herself or whether to rely on Britain
and the USA coming to her aid should
she be attacked or threatened with
nuclear bombs. Unless India can be given
some verv definite assurances by the UK
or the USA or both it seems very likely
that she will be the next nation to make
nuclear weapons.
Before considering which other
nations might take the same decision,
and what the impact of this developing
situation is likely to be on Australia, it
is necessary to outline what is involved
in becoming a nuclear power.
To produce nuclear weapons, one
first requires supplies of plutonium or
U-235. The former is a man-made
material and, for its production on a
considerable scale, requires installation
of many high-powered nuclear reactors.
U-235 is present in all uranium ores but
only to 1 part in 140 the bulk of
the uranium being the heavier isotope
U-238. To make weapons, then, the
U-235 has to be separated from the 238
and, in quantity, this is difficult.
Three methods are possible diffu-
sion, electromagnetic separation and
centrifugal separation. The plants for
the first two are very large, require engi-
neering of a high degree of sophistication
and consume huge quantities of elec-
tricity; but West Germany has produced
quite small centrifuge separation equip-
ment. Red China at this stage has no
such plants in operation, but is estab-
lishing a diffusion plant. Nor does she
have high-powered nuclear reactors to
produce plutonium as yet the material
for the bomb just tested was accrued
over a longish period of time from her
small reactor. These are the reasons why
we believe China cannot become a
major nuclear power quickly; some 10
years or so will be required for her to
establish a substantial stockpile of
nuclear weapons.
Once plutonium or U-235 is avail-
able it has to be fabricated into suitable
form. Both materials are radioactive
and the former is highly toxic. Moreover,
if too much material comes together in
one place at one time a nuclear ex-
plosion can occur spontaneously. Fab-
rication therefore demands specialised
equipment, safety measures, and high
metallurgical skills.
The rudiments of nuclear bomb de-
sign are now common property. In fact,
as soon as sufficient U-235 or plutonium
is assembled together an explosion
occurs immediately. The minimum quan-
tity required is called a critical mass of
the material. One simple technique
would therefore be to take two masses
of material each sub-critical and throw
them together very quickly to form a
super-critical mass which would ex-
plode. Another method is to take a
mass which is just below critical size
and compress it very rapidly to a
smaller size so that it goes critical and
explodes. The fast assembly of the
critical mass is the key to achieving a
big explosion and the techniques for do-
ing this are the carefully guarded
secrets. But it is known that the tech-
nology involves ingenious and cunning
uses of high explosives and therefore
makes demands in that field.
Once a suitable assembly system is
designed it has to be tested and im-
proved as far as possible prior to the
first nuclear explosion, but eventually a
nuclear test has to be made. Thereafter

regular testing is essential to improve
the design by increasing the efficiency
of the bomb so as to obtain the biggest
possible explosion from a given amount
of the expensive fissile material. This
entails the setting up and instrumenting
of an appropriate site and involves the
production of sophisticated equipment
and the necessary scientists to maintain
and operate it.
To produce and test the first rudimen-
tary bomb is one thing, but to go from
this to a substantial stockpile of highly
efficient weapons is quite another. This
last step involves building an entirely
new industry with all the novelty and
specialisation indicated by the foregoing.
These, then, are the reasons why we
believe China cannot establish a large
stockpile of nuclear weapons quickly—
some ten years or so will be required.
Moreover, bombs are no use without
delivery vehicles advanced aircraft or
missiles and these would have to be
produced in parallel, so increasing the
demands on Chinese technical and in-
dustrial resources.
At present China has no aircraft in-
dustry and has not embarked on the
large-scale production of military missiles
such as are required to carry nuclear
bombs. But we should not underestimate
their capability to do these things. Nor
would she be completely impotent with-
out them. Nuclear bombs are small and
can be broken down into parts. It is
not impossible for parts to be smuggled
into a country and assembled clandes-
tinely to await firing at an appropriate
time. Nor is it impossible, in the appro-
priate areas, for a tramp steamer, or for
that matter a Chinese junk, to enter a
chosen harbor carrying a nuclear
bomb.
Such suggestions may seem far-fetch-
ed, but they will have to be considered.
With the foregoing in mind, let us
consider which other countries might
feel compelled to produce their own
nuclear weapons. We have already said
that India is in a position to do so.
Israel lives precariously under threats
from the Arabs. Greatly outnumbered,
she would have to rely on superior
armament technology in any future war.
Nuclear bombs could confer enormous
strength in her defence and there is no
doubt at all about the technical com-
petence of Israel to produce weapons.
In such a case it would not be neces-
sary to match the giants in the nuclear
club a stockpile of a few dozen, not
many thousands, of bombs would suffice
as a deterrent to local attack.
Both Italy and Japan have bought
nuclear power stations from the UK;
both have the know-how, technical
competence and industrial resources to
embark on a weapons programme should
they wish to do so. But neither of these
nations will feel themselves threatened
at this stage in the same way as India
and Israel do. In Switzerland and Swe-
den there has been talk of producing
nuclear weapons Tfor defensive pur-
poses again implying a small stock-
pile and both countries have the ad-
vanced technology which would make it
possible.
In fact two leagues are likely to de-
velop. Firstly, the really big-timers such
as the UK, USA and USSR with France
and China intent on joining; and all of
whom will build large stockpiles, in-
cluding megaton weapons, backed up
with the essential means to deliver the
bombs anywhere in the world. Second-
ly, a group of nations, some of whom
may be neutrals and others of whom
may be allied to one or other of the
big-timers, but who nevertheless may
feel it to be essential in the interests of
their own security to have a relatively
small number of nuclear weapons direct-
ly under their own control.
In the light of these developments we
can now consider our own position in
Australia. We are isolated from our major
allies the UK and the USA by
very great distances. Communism is on
the march in South-East Asia. A belli-
cose Indonesian President makes no
secret of expansionist aims and openly
indulges in acts of aggression against
Malaysia. Further to the north, the
Chinese colossus is developing the tech-
nology and industry which inevitably
will make it one of the most powerful
nations of all time.
The Australian Government has
shared the UK-USA view that the spread
of nuclear weapons to more and more
countries is undesirable. Because of this
no effort has been made to acquire
nuclear bombs, nor have facilities been
established in Australia to make them
for ourselves. These decisions must now
be reviewed in the light of the changing
circumstances. Prior to the general elec-
tion in the UK, Mr Harold Wilson, now
Prime Minister, talked of scrapping the
British deterrent. In office, of course, he
may change his mind. One would hope
so, for this is no time for the UK to
place its future defence capability en-
tirely into the hands even of a tried
and trusted friend.
The possibility of such major changes
in the balance of power affect Australia
directly and underline the need for a
careful review of our position. Clear and
definite arrangements with the UK and
the USA are essential. Even with these,
however, consideration must now be
given to deciding whether Australia, too,
should join the minor nuclear league.
This could be effected either by acquir-
ing from our allies or by making for
ourselves a nuclear weapon stockpile
sufficient for us to be able to repel any
attempted invasion of Australia.

THE RACING GAME
The Biggest and the Richest
The One Day of the Year
By ARTHUR HARRIS
IN the spring, for at least one day,
practically everyone’s fancy turns to
the thought of horses. And this year
the VRC Carnival is to be the biggest,
the richest, the most glamorous . . .
A race meeting was held for the first
time on the banks of the Maribyrnong
River on March 3, 1840, and a make-
shift grandstand was used to accommo-
date the spectators. The flat where the
races were held soon came to be known
as Flemington because of Fleming’s
butcher shop on the nearby thorough-
fare.
The early meetings were conducted by
the Port Phillip Turf Club, which in
1848 persuaded the Government to give
it a lease of the Flemington ground.
This turf club held the first Melbourne
Cup in 1861, when 57 horses were
entered. By this time a rival turf club,
the Melbourne Jockey Club, had come
into existence. In 1864 these two bodies
were dissolved and their liabilities taken
over by a new club, the Victoria Racing
Club which was formed on March 9,
and the Melbourne Cup has been con-
ducted under the auspices of that club
ever since.
The Melbourne Cup enjoyed tremen-
dous popularity in its first 20 years. In
1868 25,000 spectators came to see the
Cup, but by 1880 100,000 persons
attended. Despite the fact that the
population of Australia in 1880 was only
about 2i million, that attendance figure
has not been equalled in recent years.
The all-time record attendance is
118,877 for Spearfelt’s Cup in 1926
(when the population of Australia was
about 5£ million).
Undoubtedly the rise of the SP book-
maker and more recently the off-course
tote together with radio and TV cover-
age of the Cup have affected attendances,
but the Cup today is still the glamor
event of the Australian turf and attend-
ances at Flemington on Cup day are
the highest for any race meeting in Aus-
tralia. For no other sporting event is
a public holiday proclaimed.
Apart from receiving great public
interest, the race is also well supported
by owners and trainers, not only because
it is the richest of the Australian turf,
but for the honor. But it takes patience
and care to prepare a horse for this
gruelling contest, because a true stayer
must be given time to develop and
mature.
Melbourne Cup winners can be divided
into two groups, those who were
brilliant as two or three-year-olds, and
those who did not develop or show much
form until late three-year-olds or four-
year-olds. The first of these groups
represent those stayers that developed
quickly and are capable of winning at
a distance while still early three-year-
olds. These are the horses that usually
win the Derby.
Twenty-three three-year-olds have won
the Melbourne Cup and of these 15
won either the VRC or AJC Derby.
This precocity in many cases enabled
them to win and often these fast develop-
ing stayers are not so good as four-year-
olds or older.
Many Derby winners are at their peak
as three-year-olds and are past their
prime as four-year-olds because the slow
maturers have caught up with them and
their superiority is not so marked. The
only Derby winners to win the Cup, not
as a three-year-old but as a four-year-
old or older, were Phar Lap, Spearfelt,
Comic Court, Delta and Peter Pan
(although Peter Pan also won as a three-
year-old). These figures indicate that
with a good spring three-year-old the
best time to tackle the Cup is as a
three-year-old rather than as a four- or
five-year-old.
In recent years the idea has grown
popular not to start a good three-year-
old in the Cup as it burns him out and
he is no good afterwards. This may well
be true for the precocious three-year-
old, but the point is that it might not
need a race such as the Cup to “flatten”
this type of horse. Many horses hit a
peak of form and after going out for
a spell never recapture it. A truly good
three-year-old is never flattened by a
Cup run and will come back as Phar
Lap and Peter Pan have shown.
The reason why a horse that shows
good form as an early three-year-old and
finds it hard to win the Cup as a four-
year-old or over lies with one of the two
causes. The first may be that the horse’s
physique could not stand the strain of
racing as an early three-year-old. A
horse does not stop growing until about
five. Pressure from training might be
too much for horses not properly
toughened up.
In recent years the list of Derby
winners that have broken down is long


Summer Fair, Summer Prince, Sky-
line, Craftsman, Persian Lyric, Martello
Towers needed no Melbourne Cup to
cause their breakdown. It has been
shown in England with the skeletons of
some horses over-raced as two-year-olds
that the vertebrae of the spine under-
neath the saddle position has been
squashed up.
The second cause is probably that
they have shown up as three-year-olds,
and when they attempt to win as four-
year-olds the handicapper is aware of
their ability and weights them accord-
ingly. A slow-maturing horse who
suddenly comes good overnight as a
four-year-old is not treated so harshly
by the handicapper and has a better
chance of winning the Cup.
Most handicap stayers do not reach
their peak until four or five. These two
age groups account for 28 winners each
of all 103 Melbourne Cups decided to
date, i.e., over 50 per cent. Because so
many stayers do not reach their peak
until four or five, their owners and
trainers must race them with great
patience and often will have had to pay
large bills by only feeding the horse for
two years before a return can be ex-
pected.
(The best results with stayers is possibly
achieved by not racing them until they
are four. They are all the better for
this because they can stand a hard
preparation necessary for distance racing
and also train on longer.
While the normal horse that races as
a two-year-old is finished as a six-year-
old, a horse that starts racing as a four-
year-old can often go on until he is
10 years old. Brown Jack in England
commenced racing as a four-year-old
and won the Queen Alexandra Stakes—
the longest flat race in Britain —for six
consecutive years. Other examples closer
to home of horses which did not race
until they were four are Maidenhead
who won the Sydney Cup and the un-
lucky River Seine who won the Queen’s
Cup this year as an eight-year-old. An-
other example is the great mare Wakeful
who ran second in the Melbourne Cup
with 10 stone.)
The fact that many stayers need
patient handling is one of the reasons
that New Zealand stayers have come to
dominate the Melbourne Cup over the
last 12 years in which period seven New
Zealanders have taken away the prize.
New Zealanders have also won 10 of
the last 12 Caulfield Cups.
Sixteen six-year-olds have won the
Cup. Generally these have been horses
that have reached their peak after their
three-year-old Jays, but have been
allotted their share of weight in the Cup
and managed to carry it to victory.
Eleven of these 16 horses had over 8.0
in their Cup wins, and two had 10 stone
or ™ or f-
Or the five to carry under 8 stone,
Rimfire (7.2) and Gaulus (7.8) scored
lucky victories, while Rivette, Wooilomai
and The Quack hit a purple patch as six-
year-olds.
The worse category is for aged horses
and only eight of these have won. These
horses are usually moderate performers
with moderate performers’ weights and
have suddenly come good at the 11th
hour of their racing careers. No aged
horse has won with over 8.4, and six of
the eight carried less than 8 stone. Aged
horses which have shown any ability
beyond the ordinary have been weighted
out of the Cup. Included among the “old
contemptibles” who won the Cup were
the outsiders Old Rowley and Catalogue.
Comparing Jockeys
By EDGAR BRITT
JgDGAR Britt, for many years a leading Australian jockey, reached the peak
of his fame when he rode in India, France and England. Now retired and
living in Sydney, he is a regular writer on racing matters and his opinions
on jockeys and horses carry more weight than most of any other racing
journalist in Australia.
I have found that the easiest way to
draw comparisons between jockeys
is by riding against them: it is much
easier to see their good moves in a race
than from the stands; you can also see
their mistakes.
Jack Thompson, Athol Mulley and
George Moore are the only three jock-
eys riding in Sydney whom I have
ridden against. Of the big Victorian
riders, Scobie Breasley is the only one
still riding whom I have ridden against
in England and Victoria. But I have
seen Roy Higgins ride on his visits to
Sydney, and when he won the Sydney
Cup on Grand Print' no jockey could
have ridden better. He is a first-class
rider, and is rapidly going to the top
in Melbourne. He has a good seat, a
fine pair of hands and rides a horse
out well.
When W. A. Smith rode Rashlore
to victory at Randwick recently he rode
a very calm and confident race to win.
Judging on that the Melbourne standards
seem very good. But I do not think their
standard is any better than the standard
of riding in Sydney.
Des Lake has come over here and
kicked off in a blaze of glory. He is
doing much better here than he was
in Victoria. Lake (22 years old) is one
of the younger generation of riders who
will go a long way. At this stage he is
starting to get the opportunities and
experience. No doubt one day Lake will
be offered a good job overseas.
Bill Camer is another good rider. He
is a lightweight who is very strong on
a horse and a strong whip rider. He
doesn’t quite seem to get the opportuni-
ties that his ability deserves.
Jack Thompson, who rode well in
Ireland and whom I rode with when he
came across to Britain, is a good rider.
He can still ride a good race and is
smart at the gate and a great judge of
pace. If Jack ever has a horse on his
inside, and the jockey wants to get out,
he hasn’t got much chance if Jack is
going well enough, for he can hold an-
other horse in a pocket as well as any
jockey I’ve ever seen. For his weight he’s
very strong on a horse and he excels
in riding over a distance.
Athol Mulley is another good rider.
He is a born horseman and he has
beautiful hands on a horse and a good
seat. Horses run well for him.
He is what I term a pattern rider.
He is very calm and cool. Sometimes his
patience in a race can scare the daylights
out of a punter who’s having a good bet
on his mount. But often Mulley can
bring his mount on the scene from a
long way back with a brilliant run to
win. He is at his best on a horse who
needs to be given every chance early.
He will not bustle this type of horse in
the early stages. At the finish he will
generally bring it along with a well
timed run to win. He likes to go the
shortest route and is a good fence rider.
Even on a free running horse Athol
Mulley likes to ease it down to settle in
behind the leaders to conserve the horse’s
energy to challenge in the straight. This
is Mulley’s pattern. On the odd horse,
there are times when I think Mulley has
stuck too much to his pattern. I’ve
thought that he should have drifted away
from it on a free running horse that
would have been better striding along in
front.
George Podmore is another of our
good lightweights. He is a man at a
boy’s weight and very vigorous and
strong on a horse. I do not think that
he gets the number of opportunities
that his ability deserves. At his weight
I think he should be more in demand.
George Moore is the maestro. He is
in great form at present and is the most
consistent of all the jockeys riding in
Sydney. His business is riding winners.
He studies every aspect of the game and
knows what's going on all round him in
a race. Often you’ll see him on the fence

in a race boxed in. But he has a good
knowledge of the ability of the horses
around him and a pretty fair idea of the
way the other jockeys ride and what
they are going to do. He also knows
what his own mount can do, and he
can then make a decision whether to
stay on the rails or mdve out when
the opportunity arises and go round the
field. He is seldom wrong. Moore is
brilliant at the gate and he has the
horse smartly away and within a couple
of strides he seems to have the animal
perfectly balanced and going smoothly.
You very rarely see him uncomfortable
in a race. He has beautiful hands on
a horse and all horses seem to run well
for him. He never gives up even when
he is riding a rank outsider. He gene-
rally has them in a winning position
approaching the turn, so they have the
opportunity to win if they are good
enough to go on with the race.
All these riders I have mentioned
would do well and certainly hold their
own overseas.
It’s a comforting thought for punters.
Prosperity from the TAB
By BOB PARSONAGE
Tracing is booming in Victoria, and
the reason is not hard to find
the Totalisator Agency Board. Next
year the boom should be on in New
South Wales, for TAB opens up in Syd-
ney in December.
Although TAB has existed in Vic-
toria for a relatively short time it has
benefited every facet of the industry.
Among its many rewards are huge in-
creases in prize money, a boost to
breeders and greatly improved amenities
for the racing public.
From a handful of agencies to start
with, 133 have sprung up in the metro-
politan area, and 83 in the country. The
agencies operated on 477 meetings in
1963-64.
TAB officials expect to have 400
agencies catering for the NSW punting
public within two years. In the same
period only about 120 were operating
in Victoria.
When TAB starts in NSW it will have
these advantages over Victoria:
• Payment to winning punters 15
minutes after each race, allowing them
to bet on following races with their win-
nings, thereby increasing the turnover.
(In Victoria, punters are paid the off
course double or other TAB bets on the
day following a weekday meeting or on
Mondays after the Saturday meeting.)
• Automatic issuing of tickets, unlike
Victoria where betting is slowed down
by manual issuing.
• Closure of betting on each race 20
minutes before starting time. (It is 40
minutes in Victoria.)
The TAB, since its birth in Victoria
in March, 1961, has progressed in leaps
and bounds. Figures released in the
Board’s 1963-64 Annual Report show
that £40,593,788 was invested in Vic-
torian agencies nearly three times the
“paltry” £13,826,268 turnover for the
first 16 months of operation.
Of last year’s total, £23,498,145 was
bet for win and place. The surprisingly
high figure of £15,772,689 was invested
on the daily “off course” double. This
daily off course double has grown enor-
mously in popularity. On the first day
of operation only £24,524 was invested.
Six months later the figure had grown
to £63,739, and in another year had
doubled to £128,372. More than
£168,000 was bet on the double on
Caulfield Cup Day.
The double is run on the two most
interesting and open events at every
meeting covered by the TAB. Because
of big fields usually about 15 run-
ners in each leg, handsome dividends
are often declared. If a punter’s selec-
tion in either “leg” is scratched his bet
is transferred onto the “substitute” (the
TAB favorite); this often results in a
windfall for the punter.
On March 16, 1962, a handful of
punters at Flemington who coupled New-
market winner Our Cobber with Western
Moon received a bonanza £1290/5/0
the highest dividend so far paid by the
TAB.
In the fourteen metropolitan meetings
held this year the lowest double dividend
declared was £4/ 8/ 6, and the highest
£2ll/15/6. The average doubles divi-
dend over the first 14 meetings was £42.
Clubs, from the all powerful Victoria
Racing Club down to the lowly Mt
Wycheproof Turf Club, reap rich rewards
from the TAB. A total of £1,379,911
was distributed to the clubs last season.
This was more than £500,000 over the
previous year’s grant. Chief recipient was
the Victorian Amateur Turf Club with
£289,730. (The VATC incorporates the
Melbourne Racing Club following a
merger and stages 50 per cent of meet-
ings in the city).
The VRC received £189,388 and
Moonee Valley Racing Club’s share was
£151,964. Country clubs split up the
remaining £455,126, Werribee getting
£33,300 and Bendigo £27,680.
The four per cent State Government
commission amounted to £1,623,751
which was distributed to hospitals and
charities.
The impact of TAB has already been
felt in Sydney. At the annual Newmarket
sales at Easter the aggregate and average
prices reached all time records in the
past two years. Breeders and auction
officials attribute this to Victorian and
Queensland buyers, who are now pre-
pared to bid much higher for yearlings.
However, country clubs are the ones
to have gained most from legalised off
course betting. TAB grants have enabled
them to increase prizemoney, thereby
inducing owners to enter better class
horses at their meetings. The result has
been an upsurge in attendances and a
keener interest in provincial racing.
Geelong Racing Club gave away £5700
in prizemoney at its Cup meeting. The
Cup was worth £1750. Moe and Cran-
bourne, which recently held their Cup
meetings, gave £3200 and £3600 respec-
tively. Prizemoney for the Werribee Gold
Cup is £2lOO.
The clubs also are pouring large
amounts into improved facilities for the
racing public. No wonder the admini-
strators of racing are happy.

How To Pick the Winner
A guide to the Melbourne Cup
By TIM WHIFFLER
A prospective Melbourne Cup winner
** must have two main credentials:
(a) form and (b) breeding. A horse not
in top form or near top form before
such a gruelling race as the Melbourne
Cup cannot win. Over the last 35 years
every Melbourne Cup winner—with only
two exceptions—has been placed at one
of his last two runs before the Cup and
has finished no further back than
seventh at his start prior to the Cup.
This rule about form will usually re-
sult in the elimination of 50 per cent of
the runners. Last year, for instance,
it dismissed 15 of the 30 final acceptors.
But form can only
tell the punter two
things: if the horse
is fit and how good
the horse is over a
particular distance.
While it may be of
some guide in full-
filling the former of
these two require-
ments in the Cup, it
cannot answer the
latter without re-
course to breeding.
This is because
many of the con-
tenders are unknown
quantities over the
Cup distance and
those that may have
run over two miles
may have competed
in a race with no
pace on and which
will be of no guide
to a fast-run race
like the Melbourne
Cup.
The question is
now raised how
can we tell when a
horse will run two
miles by breeding?
The answer lies
more with the sires
in a horse’s pedigree over the last four
generations than with the maternal side.
Two sires which both stood at the
Duke of Portland’s Welbeck Abbey Stud
in England at the turn of the century
have come to exert the greatest influence
on Melbourne Cup winners. These sires
were St Simon and the mighty Austra-
lian horse Carbine. Sires tracing in
paternal descent to these two great
stallions can be found in the pedigree
of nearly every Melbourne Cup winner.

He was a son of Galopin and other sons
of Galopin also appear in the pedigrees
of Cup winners. Rather than refer to
St Simon blood it would be wiser to
refer to Galopin blood, remembering
that St Simon was the greatest of all
Galopin's sons.
Carbine himself won the Melbourne
Cup and was by Musket, a son of Toxo-
philite. Again, instead of referring to
Carbine blood it would be better to
refer to Toxophilite blood, as descen-
dants of Toxophilite not tracing to Car-
bine feature in Cup winners’ pedigrees.
Some examples of
past Cup winners
are given in the box
on this page, toge-
ther with strains of
the leading candi-
dates this year.
Provided that
they meet the form
require men t s al-
ready specified, the
four best Cup can-
didates on breeding
are those at the top
of this list (but
Algalon may be a
value bet).
These four horses
have good stamina
on their dam’s side
as well.
(1) Bon Filou is
the best bred for
distances on the fe-
male side of his
pedigree. The dam
of Bon Filou, Con-
trive, is a sister to
Calibrate (winner of
the New Zealand
Cup over 2 miles).
(2) Striking
Force’s third dam,
Duchess Pet, is a
three - quarter sister
in blood to Prince Foote (who won the
Melbourne Cup).
(3) Royal Sovereign is out of Sabah,
a half-sister to Prince Rezan who won
the Queensland Cup (2 miles).
(4) Elkayel’s third dam, Lugano, is a
half-sister to Kilmoon (dead-heated for
first in the Wellington Cup over two
miles).
These four horses must therefore be
rated the best Melbourne Cup chances.
If any of them fail to meet the form
requirements, they can be discarded.

In every one of Australia’s rapidly
expanding cities, striking buildings
testify to the use of aluminium as a
structural and decorative metal. With
its outstanding combinations of
strength and light weight, aluminium
has proved itself invaluable as a
material for curtain walling, window
frames, door suites, suspended ceil-
ings, balustrades, sun hoods and
roofing. The ease with which it can
be extruded in a multitude of shapes
and cross-sections, its variety of
alloys, and its remarkable corrosion
resistance, have resulted in its ready
acceptance by Australia’s architects
and engineers.
Some of these buildings will be
familiar to you. Others you may have
heard of. All of them have been
built within the past eight years. In
all of them, Australuco aluminium
has been extensively used. All of
them demonstrate aluminium’s ver-
satility and lasting attractiveness.
Of course, there’s more to achieve-
ment than aluminium alone. Achieve-
ment also means Australuco’s years
of experience in research, testing,
design and improved alloys . . . years
of practical application which can be
summed up in two words: know-how.

Merman: Upright,
Forthright, Downright
"The show is everything while Tin on it "
By CHARLES HIGHAM
She had been compared with an earth-
quake, a tornado, a blizzard, a tidal
wave, an impatient horse, an air-
raid siren, an electric sign in Times
Square, and the atomic bomb. She had
begun her career as a woman in a
leopard-skin, projected by savages into
a papier-mach6 jungle in an early Warner
Brothers two-reeler. She had been de-
scribed by one critic as “like nothing else,
alive or dead”. One expected, waiting
for Ethel Merman to hit the stage at
Sydney’s Chevron-Hilton, to experience
a phenomenon of nature, a freak in a
fright-wig. Instead, an upright, forth-
right, downright matron in a spangled
black cocktail dress and pumps got onto
the stage, sang a score or so of numbers
m a loud but pleasant voice, executed
8 fox-trot with herself during the lyrics,
and did nothing more earth-shaking than
wave a hand, decorated with a pearl
the size of a horse-pill, in the direction
of the spotlight.
By means of a transistor microphone
sewn into her bodice, she kept the
audience happily on the brink of deaf-
ness f° r niore than an hour. Later, in
her penthouse, clad in a print dress with
a choker necklet sporting a single,
gigantic precious stone, she again seemed
ordinary, unremarkable and charming.
She sat almost motionless in her chair,
did not smoke or toy with a drink or
pace about like most stars. Her face was
full of experienced pain, but her tiny
button eyes were bright as sequins,
snapping humorously in sunbursts of
wrinkles, and her smile was motherly
and cosy under the tangle of sandy hair.
Considering she was in the midst of a
mutually recriminatory divorce suit and
that posters had dealt crudely with her
that afternoon, she was amazingly with-
out temperament. You could believe her
when she said she ate steak tartare
raw strips of meat chopped up like food
for the dog—before a performance, filed
her own correspondence, did her own
typing and kept a record of every show
she had ever done.
I asked her about her first musical,
“Girl Crazy”. Unlike most performers,
she remembers everything, tiny details
of half a life-span ago as clearly as
though they had happened the previous
weekend. She had been singing “Sing,
\ou Sinners in an act between movie
shows when “Girl Crazy’s” producer,
Vinton Freedley, had hired her as the
woman who kept the ranch Ginger
Rogers went to stay in in the musical.
She auditioned for Gershwin, who wrote
it. “I went up to his apartment at 33
Riverside Drive. I wasn’t nervous, I
never am, but I was awe-struck. It was
like going to visit God. He was very
handsome, with a beautiful Babu’s head,
done like a sculpture. He had a pointed
nose, a little turned down, like this.”
She ran her finger over her own. “He
played piano, his ‘I Got Rhythm’. He
said, ‘lf there’s anything you want
changed in the number, just say so.’
Imagine me, wanting to change a Gersh-
win tune! So I said something like, ‘No,
that will do quite all right, Mr Gershwin,
thank you.’
“Yes, when I sang ‘I Got Rhythm’ I
stopped the show. Cold! When I heard
the cheering and shouting I thought
something must have gone wrong with
my dress!” She laughed loudly and
happily, living a remembered pleasure.
Thirty-four years fell from her face and
her eyes were as sharp as a young girl’s.
“In the interval all these important
people came to see me in my dressing-
room. There was Joan Crawford, I
remember; she was married to Douglas
Fairbanks then. As naive as I was I
didn’t realise what happened to me until
about 10 days later.” Not only had she
played a taxing role in the show, she had
been making two-reelers for Paramount
in the daytime and appearing at the
Central Park Casino in the middle of the
night. “I was young, and mother fed
me well.”
The first vehicle especially written for
her had been “Panama Hattie”, about a
girl she delicately called a “friend of
sailors” in the Canal Zone. “Now what
was the date that opened? Just a minute,
I’ll look it up.” She went out of the
room and came back with a bulky,
quarto-sized loose-leaf book in a black
folder. It contained dates, names, details
of encyclopaedic thoroughness about
everything that had happened to her in
her career, all written out in a neat long-
hand script. “I keep this for reference
at all times,” she said crisply, turning
over the pages. “Let me see . : . yes,
October, 1940.”
She had been in “Something For The
Boys” and then, notably, “Annie Get
Your Gun”. “I remember one night we
were playing ‘Annie’ in Boston. There
is a scene where I’m coming back from
Europe on a freighter. I’m sitting in a
deck-chair and I sight a seagull. I’m
supposed to pick up my Annie Oakley
gun and fire at the gull. It falls. Then
I’m supposed to send my little brother
off the stage with the bird, saying ‘Take

Tired of the
Executive
Rat-Race?
WELL, GET OUT OF IT!
The longer you ‘sit’ on a job the
harder it looks. Any good executive
knows that. Yet decisions are put
off by the thousand every day.
‘Difficult’ jobs go into the ‘too
hard’ basket.
This procrastination is like a disease
in business. It’s the by-product of
the Executive Life. The pressure
goes on the strain gets tougher
the mind often flags. Result?
Work looks harder so takes more
out of you. So the mind flags more.
The rat-race is on.
A mind under pressure needs good
care. The executive life tension,
worry, hurried unbalanced meals,
alcohol often leads to a deficiency
of essential B Group vitamins.
These are the vitamins —BI in
particular which have a signifi-
cant effect in conserving nervous
energy. Additional B 1 is often pres-
cribed during periods of physical
stress and excessive mental activity.
You may not get adequate Vitamin
B from your meals. The drinks you
have to relax you, increase your
needs still further.
It’s comparatively easy to stop the
rat-race and get off. But you must
make a decision. You must put
yourself on to ‘TAB-VITA’ B
GROUP FORT tablets. This is a
potent source of B group vitamins
enriched with Vitamin C. It is not
a miracle ‘cure’ but if taken regularly
may do a lot to help restore your
initiative and drive. Get out of that
rat-race. Tear out this advertisement
and go to your chemist. Or send
your secretary to get a bottle.

it in the ‘too hard’ basket, please.

this down to the kitchen and tell the
cook to make a seagull sandwich out of
it.’ Well, I take aim and fire. And the
darned bird doesn’t fall down on cue.
So I have to think fast. So I say to my
kid brother instead, ‘Go down to the
cook and tell him to make a seagull
sandwich. So the boy leaves the stage.
There’s silence for a minute or two.
Then, after all that, there’s a noise and
the seagull hits the deck . . .”
She laughed, then suddenly the creased
face looked sad, she was almost crying
with a remembered pain. “I remember
another time during that run of ‘Annie’.
My little girl Ethel was four years old
at the time. She got very sick, the little
thing. She had to have her tonsils out
and I don’t know how it is here but over
there they don’t like to operate in Janu-
ary in case the children get pneumonia.
So they gave her penicillin and she was
allergic not to the penicillin but to
the beeswax it came in. She broke out in
hives from head to toe ... I was so
worried about her . . . but the show must
go on, you know the saying, so all one
Wednesday matinee I played that cheer-
ful role crying, just crying. I was singing
brassy numbers—‘You Can’t Get a Man
with a Gun’—and the tears were just
streaming down my face!”
She had enjoyed “Call Me Madam”
and had become a close friend of Perle
Mesta, whom it was based on, but
“Gipsy” had been her favorite role
because, for once, it gave her a chance
to play a full-fleshed human being.
Away from the stage, she said she had
always been a Republican, from the age
of five when she had sung at Republican
Clubs in Astoria, Long Island. “You
know, I sang a song called ‘I Like Ike’
in ‘Panama Hattie’,” she said. “I cam-
paigned for Ike at the Cow Palace in
San Francisco, singing a song for him to
the tune of ‘Alexander’s Ragtime Band’.
I admire him so much ... I have 25
items from him framed . . . letters, in-
vitations . . . and so on . . .”
Aside from her interests in politics,
did she have any others? Reading? Going
to movies? “I never read books except
when I’m on planes, and I never or
almost never —go to movies or other
shows. Most of my friends are, frankly
speaking, way outside show business.”
Evidently, performing in a show was for
her simply a job she did, hard work like
stevedoring or running an addressograph
system. “The show is everything while
I’m on it. Why, take tonight for instance.
When you leave I’m just going to put
U P my hair, eat and think about the
show.” She looked almost defiant, chal-
lenging life to face her with anything
that could distract her attention from the
evening’s austere discipline. “Just eat
a nd think about the show. And that’s
all!”
The Search for Simplicity
“The best thing about Sydney homes is the harbor-view"
By HUGH CURNOW
You can tell a lot about a man, they
say, from his taste in rooms. So
before we spoke to the visiting
English interior decorator, the Hon.
John Siddeley, I strolled through the six
mock-up rooms that David Jones had
built to his instructions on the sixth
floor of their Market Street store in
Sydney. A Siddeley sign outside The
Bedroom said bedrooms should be
feminine. The Teenagers’ Room included
portable TV, a blown-up plastic beach
ball, a dartboard, a deck of playing-
cards, a copy, of ‘"MAN” magazine, a
huge china piggy-bank and a Beatles
record cover. The sign outside the
Dining-room said a dining-room is really
for entertaining. Inside was an elegant
table set for four underneath a chan-
delier. The walls were surrounded by
white plastic cast-iron balconies set
against a backdrop of Thai silk curtains
and lit from above and behind. Rather
like eating inside outside at Paddo.
The Country Dining-room, said an-
other sign, was there because not every-
one lives in towns. Its floor was cover-
ed in straw matting. The Sitting-room
was done entirely in wool - including
the walls and looked very warm.
The Living-room included some of Mr
Siddeley’s paintings from his private col-
lection. A tiny Renoir was hung im-
mediately under a larger Van Gogh.
Louis Quinze rubbed shoulders with
Louis Seize, and in the corner a built-
in library was stacked with real though
not Siddeley-selected books.
He was concluding the second of his
daily hour-and-a-half lectures nearby

on a tiny stage. With one exception
a David Jones staff man the small
auditorium was crowded with women.
This, someone from David Jones’ public
relations department said, was the lecture
entitled “Art and Architecture In Rela-
tion To Interior Design”, and was the
“more highbrow” of the two. As he
finished speaking, women crowded for-
ward and asked Mr Siddeley to auto-
graph sketches he had made during the
afternoon. He obliged, smilingly, and,
when one matron asked him earnestly
how she could ensure the autograph
would not fade, told her to lacquer it.
“She has come to my lectures three
times and asked my advice about her
decorating problems each time. I must
say I’m flattered,” Mr Siddeley said,
flicking shut the top of his gold Dunhill
pillar-action lighter. I asked him what
he thought of Australian houses, inside.
He smiled. “Well, they’re not really
brave enough, are they?”, he said, “I
mean, Australians aren’t yet game to be
quite simple about it all, really. Often
the rooms look ‘decorated’ rather than
lived in. Actually I love the Australian
homes that pretend to be nothing other
than what they are: homes, either old or
new. But, do you know, I think the best
thing about Sydney homes is the view
of the harbor. I can’t take my eyes off
it.”
Mr Siddeley said he had not inherited
the Amstrong-Siddeley fortune. The heir
of the second Baron Kenilworth, he is
destined to be Lord Kenilworth one day
but says he won’t forget that he started
his working life earning £5 10s. a week.
“People keep saying I’ve used the Sid-
deley money to help me along. It makes
me furious, I can tell you”. Mr Siddeley
has come a long way since his £5 10s.
days. Now one of London’s most
fashionable and sought - after interior
decorators, he recalls designing furniture
for the luxurious suites at the Carlton
Towers in Knightsbridge and doing the
decor for the Harlequin Suite at the Dor-
chester in Mayfair. “That’s the one Eli-
zabeth Taylor said she likes best, even
though she always stayed in the Oliver
Messel Suite”, the David Jones spokes-
man said.
Mr Siddeley, understandably enough,
is content to rest on his well-earned
laurels without mentioning Miss Tay-
lor’s taste . . . “The main thing, after
all”, he said finally, “is simplicity. If my
lectures have their effect, I expect to see
a lot more of that when I return to Syd-
ney in 18 months”.
One of Johnson’s
Republicans
A Luce comes “to look around”
By PATRICIA ROLFE
Mr Henry Luce, iii, at present visit-
ing Australia, might be a micro-
cosm of the American elector’s
dilemma. If he gets back to the United
States by November 5, he will forgo his
status as an independent Republican to
vote for Lyndon Johnson. His father,
the founder and chairman of “Time” and
“Life” magazines, is reportedly mildly
in support of Johnson (although Mr
Luce says: “If you really want to know
how Dad’ll vote, ring him up and ask
him”), while his step-mother, Mrs Clare
Boothe Luce, is campaigning for Senator
Barry Goldwater.
Is Mr Luce voting for Johnson or
against Goldwater? “Both.” Who does
he think will win? “Johnson.” Mr Luce
said this would be the first time that he
had voted for a Democratic candidate
for President. However, he liked to
think of himself, as a newspaperman, as
technically independent. He thought it
was important for a newspaperman not
to be too committed in politics. Gener-
ally, he voted a split ticket.
Mr Luce, a vice-president of the com-
pany in charge of research and develop-
ment, was spending about 10 days in
Australia, taking in Sydney, Canberra,
Melbourne and Perth. He came via
Japan, Taiwan and Hong Kong—Asian
countries where “Time” and “Life” sell
well, rather than those where at the
moment news is made. He was here, he
said, “to look around”, both at Australia
and the firm's operations here.
Mr Luce’s appearance and manner
seem ideal for anyone who wants to look
around and not be looked at. Nothing
about him smacks of power, money or
influence, and nothing about his slow-
speaking, but self-assured manner reveals

any trauma about having grown up in
the shadow of a remarkable man. Several
dozen carbon copies of Mr Luce, in
lightweight, crumpled suit, with a crew
cut and the look of a college-boy who
is hitting middle age rather hard, cross
the foyer of Australian hotels in a day.
In Sydney he didn’t displace any of the
visiting entertainers from the luxury
suites of the Chevron Hilton, but he and
his wife, suntanned pink from a harbor
cruise and rather absent-mindedly clutch-
ing a toy kangaroo, seemed comfortable
in quite modest quarters.
Mr Luce has no particular confidence
in the ability of newspapers to sway
electors. “Perhaps ‘Time’ is an opinion-
stimulator, but I don’t regard it as an
opinion-maker,” he said. “But, of course,
public opinion is a nebulous pheno-
menon. No one can really gauge what
affects it.
“In highly developed countries the
sheer weight of informational material
must have some effect on people’s minds,
but I think it just enables them to vote
cut of more knowledge. When I talk
this way I am thinking of very free
societies, such as the United States, and,
I think, Australia.”
Mr Luce said that the international
edition of “Time” magazine was planned
in exactly the same way as the domestic
edition and often contained substantially
the same material. No attempt was made
to predigest the material or to slant it to
make it either more acceptable or more
intelligible to non-Americans.
“It is true that foreign Governments,
particularly those of under-developed
countries, have taken ‘Time’s’ version
of events as the voice of the American
Government,” he said. “However, there
isn’t anything we can do about that,
except, of course, apologise to the
American Government.”
On the internal running of “Time”
and “Life”, Mr Luce said that because
of an elaborate system of research and
rewriting, “virtually nothing” which ap-
peared in “Time” was written by the
same person. He did not see that this
might appear to show a lack of con-
fidence in the paper’s journalists.
On his father, Mr Luce said that the
thing which still impresses him most is
Henry Luce’s capacity for work.
“Sure he takes vacations, sure he
sometimes takes time off,” he said. “But
when he is working he is hard at it:
reporting, listening to people, reading.
His reading covers an enormous range.
Anywhere he travels he gathers im-
pressions. And he will listen to any-
body to learn anything new, even to
people like me from whom he must
have heard it all before.”

Peking Moves into Africa
Smiles and courtesies reserved
From COLIN LEGUM in London
44 A N excellent revolutionary situa-
tion exists in Africa.” That is
how Chou En-lai, the Chinese
Prime Minister, summed up his Afri-
can explorations last December. As a
result of that visit, the Chinese have
completely changed their strategic
priorities in the continent, though with-
out changing their basic aim. This is to
establish a Peking-orientated alliance be-
tween Africa, Asia and Latin America
to prevent the isolation of China by
Western and Russian diplomacy.
The Chinese are not interested in any-
thing as crude as trying to “buy” or
“grab” Africa. To represent them as neo-
colonialists or imperialists is to misjudge
their motives, and to obscure the reasons
for such success as they have had.
Before his December visit, Chou had
concentrated Chinese diplomacy and aid
on five relatively strong and radical
North and West African States —Egypt,
Algeria, Mali, Guinea and Ghana. Now,
while still maintaining strong embassies
in North and West Africa, the bulk of
Chinese resources are concentrated in
the militarily weaker and politically less
stable States in East and Central Africa.
They have offered far larger trade and
aid programmes to these countries—£ls
million to Tanganyika and Zanzibar, £7
million to Kenya (besides regular Chin-
ese payments to certain Kenyan politi-
cians), £8 million (plus arms) to Somalia,
and £lB million (according to Dr Banda)
to Malawi—than they ever did to the
others. They are also paying special
attention to the liberation struggle in the
Portuguese territories and Southern
Africa and to the rebels in the Congo.
No less significant has been the con-
centration of Chinese diplomats in East
and Central Africa. They have establish-
ed an extensive network of diplomatic
posts, agents and contacts along an arc
stretching from Dar es Salaam to Braz-
zaville. To the north of Dar es Salaam
the network stretches into Kenya and
"A successful nuclear test by
China may give the colored
people in the world a sense of
pride . . . "
— "Statesman", Calcutta.
Somalia; to the south it goes into Nor-
thern Rhodesia, South Africa and Basu-
toland.
The nerve-centre of this network is
the Chinese Embassy in Dar es Salaam,
which is today the most important politi-
cal capital in Africa (as the seat of the
Organisation of African Unity’s Libera-
tion Committee it attracts liberation
fighters from all over the continent. It is
also a convenient point where Kenyan
and other politicians can collect their
personal aid). The ambassador there is
Ho-Ying, a chubby, smiling diplomat
who apparently knows no English. But
the key figure is Kao Liang, the tough
übiquitous correspondent of the New
China News Agency, who carries out the
exploratory probes for Ho-Ying and
acts as a go-between for the diplomats
and their African contacts^
It is difficult to determine the precise
number of Chinese diplomatic agents
who operate within this network for,
although African governments restrict
the size for all embassies, they have little
control over the continuous movement of
large numbers of Chinese political,
technical and cultural missions.
Apart from the Americans, however,
the Chinese embassies are by far the
largest in that part of the world much
larger, for instance, than either those of
Britain or the Soviet bloc. The perma-
nent Chinese corps in Dar es Salaam is
between 30 and 40. There are perhaps
twice that number of diplomats and
technicians in Zanzibar; at least 20 in
Kenya; a dozen in Uganda; tiny Burundi
has 20—as against only four Russians.
In all these places the Chinese always
live together, segregated in their own
diplomatic compounds. They employ no
outsiders, bringing even their domestic
servants with them. They invariably eat
together in private, and they play little
part in diplomatic life. They pointedly
refuse to talk to the Americans, are rude
to the Israelis and Yugoslavs, and are
curt with the Russians. All their smiles
and courtesies are reserved for Africans.
Three separate types of activity are
conducted through the Chinese network.
First, maintaining straightforward diplo-
matic relations, which requires special
skill because of the frequent offences
caused by a second type —keeping close
ties with specially favored African
leaders, who act as contacts for the
Chinese. A small number of these receive
direct financial support. Sometimes these
contacts are themselves important mem-
bers of the government or of the ruling
party.
A third type of activity is continuous
beavering to make new contacts and to
develop these to the point of deciding
whether they are “worthwhile”. An
esssential part of this exploration is a free
trip to Peking. By no means all those
favored in this way pass the test of
acceptance. There are many more would-
be takers of Chinese monetary aid than
actual recipients. Although the Chinese
will hand out small sums of money, they
are carefully discriminating when it
comes to large sums.
A ll the time, they maintain an uncom-
promisingly revolutionary attitude:
unlike the Russians they believe this is
the surest way of gaining support. They
tell Africans that political independence
is not real independence; that this can
come only through armed struggle; that
they are able and willing to guide that
struggle; that real liberation cannot be
achieved through aid from the United
States or even from the Soviet bloc.
They concentrate their efforts on Afri-
can radicals, whether in or out of
government; and especially on the leaders
of liberation movements To them they
promise open-handed financial, technical
and military support.

New Kodak Copier accepts...
“BRIEF-SIZE” DOCUMENTS
The VERIFAX WITNESS Copier,
newest member of the world-famous family of Verifax copiers, is
now introduced to Australia. It has two outstanding features:
copying large documents up to 18 x 14 inches in size, and copying
pages from magazines and books.
The Witness will copy documents of legal “brief” size and larger.
It is therefore particularly suitable for use in offices where legal
documents, company reports, prospectuses, share certificates, patent
applications, leases, briefs, wills, affidavits etc. are handled.
Of course, the Verifax Witness will copy smaller documents and
letters with equal ease. All copies are dry, ready for immediate use.
They are clear, smudge-free, inexpensive and, above all, photo-
accurate and permanent.
Any original, of any colour can be copied. Verifax copies are made
on high-quality bond paper; they may be made on coloured stock,
or paper pre-printed witn a letterhead. Like ail Verifax copiers, the
WITNESS can save hours of costly copy-typing and checking.
The Verifax system will give you HIGHEST-QUALITY SINGLE
Copies as well as LOWEST-COST MULTIPLE COPIES. Let
us convince you with a demonstration.
Telephone now for an appointment.

More than a Scotch, a Tradition for over ioo years.
Nor are they too fussy about the
movements they choose to support.
For instance, they ignore the internal
conflicts within the National Liberation
Committee in the Congo, and support
all its wings indiscriminately. Having
tried hard but without success to win
over the sympathy of the African
National Congress in South Africa, they
are now concentrating with some ap-
parent success on the Pan-Africanist
Congress—a movement which declares
itself to be anti-Communist.
Their opportunism is shown by their
open support for the Tutsi refugee move-
ment, “The Cockroach”, committed to
the overthrow of the R\ anda Govern-
ment. For centuries the Tutsis of Ruanda
were notorious feudal aristocrats who
treated the Hutu majority like helots. In
1953 the Hutu peasants revolted; colonial
Belgium accepted the result, and a Hutu
peasant government took Ruanda into
independence. It is the first genuinely
peasants’ government in Africa. Yet the
Chinese are allied with the fallen Tutsi
aristocracy in trying to overthrow it.
This piece of opportunism gained the
Chinese an unexpected foothold in
Burundi, the vital neighboring State to
the Congo from which Gaston Soumialot
launched his rebel attacks.
this activity is part of what the
* Chinese see as the “first wave” of the
revolutionary struggle. During this they
accept the need for alliances with almost
anybody willing to denounce the Ameri-
cans and to approve in general terms of
revolution as an instrument of liberation.
In the “second wave”, the struggle
assumes its ideological character. For
this purpose the revolution needs militant
cadres capable of seizing power for the
proletariat and the peasants. Peking’s
maxim for the cadres is blunt: “Political
power grows out of the barrel of a gun.”
The main Chinese success so far is
their successful appeal to the radical-
mindedness and growing anti-Western
feelings current even among normally
well-disposed Africans. This is due to
disappointments and doubts over Ameri-
can and British policies in the Congo, in
South Africa, in the Portuguese terri-
tories and in Zanzibar; and because of
Western failure to provide the kind of
aid the Africans themselves desire.
What of the Chinese failures? First,
contrary to their earlier beliefs, they
failed to make any real headway in
Egypt, Algeria, Guinea or Ghana, al-
though they might have made some in
Mali- They had hoped, by an oppor-
tunistic initiative, to establish a foothold
ln Somalia, but the Russians outflanked
them and took over the training of the
Somali army. More recently, the Somali
leaders who initiated the Peking talks
have lost office. Their clearest setback
came in Zanzibar where, again, it was
the Russians who outmanoeuvred them
through their East German allies.
There are virtually no Communist
parties in Black Africa, but the few that
exist —as in South Africa and Basuto-
land —side with Moscow against Peking.
China’s greatest failure, so far, has
been with the major liberation move-
ments in South Africa and the Portu-
guese territories which would seem to be
excellent clients for what Peking has to
offer. Although both the major liberation
movements in Angola and Mozambique
have negotiated with China, nothing
practical has come from these talks.
But although there is no doubt of
China’s comparative lack of success so
far, her strategy cannot be judged simply
by short-term results. The Chinese are
gambling heavily on the correctness of
their analysis that Africa is ripe for
revolution. If they are right, they might
yet be able to hope for success when the
present African governments begin to
crack, and when violence spreads in the
Portuguese territories and in South
Africa, (ofns)

THE
Should India
Have the Bomb?
To preserve non-alignment
From JAMES MITCHELL
in New Delhi
HPhe Calcutta “Statesman”, in asking
-*• whether India should not think of
developing an atomic bomb, has jolted
the complacency of many people. A
muffled debate on this delicate subject
had been going on for some time, but
the image—largely created by Nehru —
of a “moral country” refusing to dirty
its hands by exploiting the most ad-
vanced scientific knowledge to perfect
the means of death was too sacred to
be questioned.
The fact that one of the most serious
and influential newspapers has decided
to start the ball rolling shows that Indian
reactions have changed a lot since the
Chinese aggression. In a way the de-
bate about the desirability of an
“Indian” bomb comes at an embarras-
sing moment. At the Cairo conference,
Prime Minister Shastri sought to put
China in the dock by proposing that the
non-aligned countries should send a
mission—or at least direct an appeal—
to the Peking Government asking it not
to pursue its nuclear endeavors.
Until now official pronouncements in
Delhi maintained firmly that India,
despite her considerable knowledge in
the atomic field, would not try to seek
entry into the nuclear club. But since
the announcement that China was on the
point of conducting her first test, there
have been signs that India was reviewing
the situation at the highest level.
When asked how long it would take
India to manufacture a bomb, Dr
Bhabha, director-general of India’s
Atomic Energy Commission, replied:
“Eighteen months.” With what certain
people here would like to consider as a
note of regret, he added, however, “but
I do not think such a decision will be
taken”.
But the Shastri Government is likely
to find itself under increasing pressure
not only from the Opposition but also
from inside the Congress organisation.
It is argued that the psychological im-
pact of the Chinese explosion will be
“terrific” among the neighboring coun-
tries and in Africa. The “Statesman”
writes: “A successful nuclear test by
China may give the colored people in
the world a sense of pride that one of
them has been able to break what has
hitherto been the monopoly of the white
nations.”
The campaign in Delhi curiously
echoes the pronouncements of President
de Gaulle, who until now has not had
many admirers in India. Says the
“Statesman”: “Many will feel President
de Gaulle talks sound sense when he
declares that the only reliable deterrent
is one’s own.” It is true that the news-
paper's only positive plea is that India
should not “tie her hands completely”.
But it gives a new and unexpected twist
to the ideology of non-alignment when
it adds that in the atomic field India
cannot “become dependent” on the pro-
tection of the USA, or the USSR, or
both, (ofns)
Circumstance
Without Pomp
British euphoria
From PATRICK O’DONOVAN
in London
arrival of a new Government to
power is a stimulating experience
which can be consciously enjoyed like a
stiff drink or a surprise present. But like
a stiff drink the stimulation is only tem-
porary and, like a present, it can prove a
disappointment. But this odd public
pleasure does exist. Britain is now en-
joying a brief period of euphoria. There
is at least the illusion that things are on
the move and, quite indefinably there is
a feeling of elation, not altogether dif-
ferent from that which precedes a care-
fully calculated bet on a carefully
chosen horse.
It would, however, be wrong to claim
a mood of national enthusiasm for the
new Government or its leader. The close-
ness of the result at the polls gives lie
to that. But, even so, a new head of
Government does entail novelty, new
faces and a flirtation with the unknown.
Even those crusted Tories who will


never refer to him as anything but
“Wilson, Ha!” or “that feller Wilson”
feel their political blood moving a little
quicker and the acceleration is caused
by more than anger or frustration.
The actual counting of the electoral
returns is, of course, one of the great
national sporting events. It arouses on
TV unparalleled interest. But the im-
mediate aftermath of victory rewards
the victor with a sudden rise in popu-
larity. Usually this' is the most uncriti-
cised and popular moment that he will
know in all his term of office. As sure
as the sun rises, he will suffer his apothe-
osis, he will be photographed, beaming
on the steps of his new official residence
and all the photographers will be at
pains to show “No. 10” on the door at
his back. The process, the pleasurable
process of adjustment has begun.
Of course there is nothing in all this
to compare wth the inauguration of an
American president. That mixture of
undogmatic religion, of solemn Repub-
lican ceremony and of small town high
spirits finds no echo in London. Each
four years there comes this regular
dawning and the joy seems always the
same. It is as if some well-loved medieval
prince had safely succeeded his father,
worn the Crown and now all will be
well. But a ceremony-soused England
denies herself pomp on this occasion.
One reason is that the Prime Minister
does not exist in law. His title to power
is that of First Lord of the Treasury.
His role as Chairman and Master of
the Queen’s Ministers and all her Gov-
ernment has merely evolved until, en-
crusted with power, he is in his sphere
a more powerful, less trammelled man
than the President of the United States.
All that happens in this change-over
is that the defeated man takes a car
(still an official one though) and drives
from Downing Street to Buckingham
Palace. In a first floor drawing room, he
surrenders his Seals of Office to the
Queen. It is not recorded whether he is
offered a stiff drink to buck him up.
Then, a little later, the successful man
leaves his home for the same Palace.
His car is his own. No roads are cleared
for him either. No flags are hung out,
no bands play, no crowds line the
streets to cheer the new leader. He goes
up to receive the Seals of Office and
kiss hands.
The preliminaries, it must be con-
fessed, are somewhat dim. But then
there follows a sort of national prize-
giving festival when the new Prime
Minister makes up his new Cabinet.
The Real Goldwater
A Mainstream Republican
By HANS J. MORGENTHAU
While talking to Senator Goldwater
in September, 1963 —questioning
him, arguing with him, sizing him
up—l could not banish from my mind
the memory of a similar encounter I
had with Senator Taft in June, 1952, a
few weeks before the Republican Con-
vention rejected his bid for the Presi-
dential nomination. I was struck by the
resemblance between their modes of
thought—a resemblance that was made
only the more striking by the obvious in-
tellectual superiority of the late Senator
from Ohio. And I remember thinking
when I left Senator Taft that I had
never met anyone so intelligent and re-
sponsible who was yet able to contradict
himself so often within the span of a
half-hour without ever being aware of
it. Senator Goldwater is endowed with
the same ability.
We must take a stronger stand against
the Soviet Union Senator Taft told
me but we must reduce our military
commitments in Europe. We must win
victory over, rather than contain, Com-
munism Senator Goldwater told me
but we must reduce the expenditures
of the Federal Government. Neither man
could be said to be so lacking in reason-
ing power as not to see these and simi-
lar contradictions if pointed out to him;
and Senator Goldwater admitted them
readily when I did so. Why, then, is it
that such an admission remains nothing
more than a lucid interval? The answer
must be sought in the romantic charac-
ter of both men and, indeed, of the
main body of Republican thought.
Liberal Republican opposition to
A Goldwater, and the newspapers and
columnists sympathising with it, have
made it appear that Goldwater has im-
posed an alien conservative philosophy
upon an unwilling Republican Party
which he has been able to dominate.
This is a myth. Goldwater’s Con-
gressional voting record shows conclu-
sively the harmony between his position
and those of the Republican members
of Congress. And, indeed, his political
philosophy individualism, free enter-
prise, States’ rights, a weak federal gov-
ernment, a balanced budget, reduced
taxes, victory over Communism, Ameri-
can omnipotence abroad either through
isolation or domination moves in the
mainstream of Republican thought. Even
if Dewey and Nixon did not share this
(or any other) philosophy, they used it;
as cold-blooded operators they could
pay lip-service to any philosophy.
However, Taft and Eisenhower certainly
shared it.
The continuity between Eisenhower
and Goldwater is striking both on the
philosophic and personal levels. To be
sure, Eisenhower's romanticism the
simple virtues of the small town, free
enterprise, reduction of federal power,
a balanced budget, a moralistic concep-
tion of foreign policy was mitigated
by vagueness and rendered relatively in-
nocuous by indolence and by a desire
for domestic and international peace.
Yet Eisenhower’s understanding of
reality, and his vision of the world to
be created by political action or lack
of it are essentially those of Gold-
water.
'C’or example, Goldwater advocates an
aggressive foreign policy which will
keep our allies in line and ultimately
lead to victory over Communism, and he
has at least played with the idea of
using atomic weapons in Vietnam. But
who was it in the 50s who advocated
brinkmanship, massive retaliation, the
liberation of’ Eastern Europe, the un-
leashing of Chiang Kai-shek, an agon-
ising reappraisal of our relations with
Europe, the “new look", and interven-
tion in Indo-China with atomic
weapons? John Fester Dulles, Eisen-
hower’s Secretary of State. Or again, no
man could have been more fervently
dedicated to balancing the budget and
curtailing the activities of the federal
government than George Humphrey who
was Eisenhower’s Secretary of the Trea-
sury from 1953-7. And Humphrey is now
one of Goldwater’s most influential sup-
porters.
While the widely held opinion of a
rift between Goldwater's philosophy of
the Republican Party is thus a legend,
there does in fact exist a cleavage be-
tween Goldwater and the Republican
tradition that is pregnant with drastic
consequences for the country should he
be elected. His immediate predecessors,
as leaders of the Republican Party,
romantic though they might have been,
were no fools. When their romantic
philosophy came up against the hard
facts of political life, it was the facts
that won out. Dulles might orate about
allowing Chiang Kai-shek to invade the
mainland, or about liberating Eastern
Europe, or hitting the Soviet Union
with atomic weapons on the occasions
and at the places of our choosing. But
when opportunity beckoned, as on the
occasion of the Hungarian Revolution
of 1956, his passivity was total, and

when the chips were down, even with
the brink nowhere in sight, as at Suez
in the same year, he forced our allies
to retreat.
Goldwater is of a different breed. He
is an honest man, and he gives at least
the impression of being a determined
man. Not only does he firmly believe in
what he says, but he also appears to
have the resolve to put into practice
what he believes, come hell or high
water. His predecessors failed because
they did not believe firmly enough and
did not try hard enough. Don Quixote
has mounted Rosinante and is at last
ready to give battle.
Goldwater’s tendency towards activism
has also been powerfully reinforced by
the objective conditions under which he
is competing for the Presidency of the
United States. For a genuine conserva-
tive position of the kind that is excep-
tional in American history has now
crystallised the position of the seg-
regationists, North and South. Here is
indeed a group that has a stake in the
status quo and is resolved to defend it.
Goldwater has become the champion of
that group. This is the novelty of our situ-
ation. Goldwater’s political romanticism
tending toward action has converged
with a conservatism requiring action.
And that is what makes his candidacy
so portentous and ominous an event in
the history of our country.
Romanticism has been the curse of
the Republican Party since 1932
Eisenhower’s victories were but acci-
dents without consequences in the history
of the Republican Party and activist
romanticism is bound to be a greater
curse still. If Goldwater were nothing
but an activist romantic, he would be
bound to go down to resounding defeat
in November. But Goldwater is also the
champion of segregationist conservatism,
and here one must distinguish between
the old conservatism of the South and
the new one of the North. The great
unknown are these new conservatives of
the North.
If Goldwater should lose
Flow large is that group? It is certainly
larger than the number of Repub-
licans who will be deterred by Gold-
water’s activism. But how large is it
likely to be in terms of electoral votes?
Nobody knows. More particularly, the
pollsters do not know, for they cannot
identify the number of habitual non-
voters who might be sufficiently aroused
this time to vote for Goldwater; nor can
they isolate the prospective conservatives
of the North from the rest of the voting
population.
If Goldwater should win, the stub-
bornness of the facts is bound to restrain
his romantic activism, and so will his
innate democratic decency. Yet it is
exactly this unwitting decency which
makes him the natural prey of people
less decent than himself. There looms,
then, the spectre of a victorious Repub-
lican Party taken over by romantic and
conservative activists, and pulled by its
own dynamics toward a fascist position.
For neither romantic restoration nor
conservative preservation is attainable
within the limits of the democratic con-
sensus. If they are to be attained, they
must be attained by violence.
If Goldwater should lose, the Repub-
lican Party he will leave behind will no
longer be a viable alternative to the
party in power. We would find ourselves
in a condition similar to that which pre-
vails in Germany, France, and the
Scandinavian countries: we would have
a two-party system in which one party
governs in virtual perpetuity. Thus,
whatever happens, this promises to be
an election memorable in the annals of
the nation.

Last Colony, Lost Causes
The years Australia wasted in New Guinea
By JAMES McAULEY
(Formerly Lecturer in Government at the Australian School of Pacific Administration.)
"C'irst, let us remind ourselves of the
elementary facts. Papua became a
British Protectorate in 1884, and a Bri-
tish Colony in 1888; it became an Aus-
tralian possession in 1906. New Guinea
was a German Protectorate from 1884
until it passed under Australian military
administration in 1914, and became a
C class Mandate in 1920. During the
last war, from 1942 onwards, the two
territories were placed under a single
military administration, and after the
war this administrative union was con-
tinued, being formalised by the Papua
and New Guinea Act, 1949, which com-
bined for the purposes of government
the two juridically separate entities, the
Trust Territory on the one hand to
Papua on the other.
I think it is true to say that from
1884 up to and even beyond the passing
of the Papua and New Guinea Act in
1949 there was no ultimate aim officially
or unofficially recognised as the aim of
political evolution.
Before the war, the absence of stated
policy was even more complete. The
fact is that anyone who, before World
War 11, had raised the question of self-
government for the native people would
have been brushed aside; and if anyone
had said that we must begin preparing
for rapid political development within
30 years or so, he would have been
thought quite mad.
It is easy enough to see why the poli-
tical question seemed so remote not so
long ago. There is an internal and an
external reason: (a) Internally, the
country was amongst the most back-
ward in the world, the most resistant to
exploration and elementary administra-
tion, let alone development. I can my-
self remember saying that when it is
possible to found an advanced economy
on sunlight, water, and leaves, New
Guinea will come into its own, but not
before. The New Guinea leaders them-
selves are now quite well aware that a
small tropical island territory, without
much prospect of special development in
minerals or other things (except, maybe,
oil), faces difficulties that cannot be
wished away, (b) Externally, we had
not got used to the operation of the law
of political acceleration which governs
our time. This is a law which makes
changes which would have taken 50
years to mature in the nineteenth cen-
tury, take only 25 years in the first
part of the twentieth-century and 10
years or less in the second part. I re-
peat that no one in 1954 would have
been game to predict that in 1964 politi-
cal evolution would have reached the
point it has. We are, I understand, at
present in the happy situation that the
New Guinea leaders are themselves not
anxious to have Australia withdraw be-
This is a condensation of a paper
recently given at a Seminar on New
Guinea held in Sydney by the Aus-
tralian Association for Cultural
Freedom.
fore they are “ready”—but even this
situation is also subject to rapid change.
To sum up: before 1949, the tacit
assumption that prevailed in default of
any other policy was that New Guinea
would be administered by Australia for
an indefinitely long time far into the
future. For most “Europeans” in the
Territory, the native population were
like a frieze painted on the wall: there,
but not in it when it came to any ques-
tion of responsibility, control, or equa-
lity. Australia was in New Guinea for
its own reasons; it prided itself —a little
too easily—on being fair in its treatment
of the native people, but it was in New
Guinea for its own reasons, and these
reasons were alone what counted.
What were the reasons? Not pri-
marily economic. Papua had proved a
great disappointment when it was taken
over. The plantation interests and the
small amount of mining did not add up
to a worthwhile economy, and the Com-
monwealth Government had to subsidise
the administration just to keep it going
at an elementary level. So disappoint-
ing was Papua, that when William Mor-
ris Hughes was urging the Australian
Parliament in 1920 to accept the Man-
dated Territory he assured them that
they need not fear it would prove
another Papua; no, it was, he said, a
territory with the potentialities of Java.
Which, of course, it was not, being a
little better than Papua, only by virtue
of a little more volcanic soil in some
areas and by virtue of goldfields that had
not yet been discovered.
If the reason was not primarily econo-
mic, what was it? Mainly it was de-
fence. From at least the middle of the
nineteenth-century the Australian States
were nervous about the strategic position
to their north. The first hostile act of
Australia in World War I was to
send a small expeditionary force to
Rabaul to take over from the Germans.
Thereafter, Australia was determined to
remain in occupation. For a long time,
mere occupation seemed to be practically
sufficient as a defence measure. It
seemed neither practicable nor necessary,
to develop the country very much, so
long as it was in our own hands. And,
indeed, it is arguable that when the test
came, the undeveloped nature of the
country worked for us and against the
enemy. For in the early months, the
Japanese advance was slowed down by
the poor facilities and communications.
Defence remained a paramount con-
cern after 1945.
What gradually pressed in on those of
us who were continuously thinking about
this matter was that the defence argu-
ment was in fact uncertain in its bear-
ings. During the fifties, the great diffi-
culty was to decide which kinds of 1
possible defence threat Australia could,
and should prepare for. In the case of l
some of the possibilities New Guinea
seemed to be rather irrelevant. Today
there has been a recrudescence of con-
cern about defence as a result of the
activity of Indonesia.
Indonesia was present in our minds as
A a problem in 1950. Mr Spender, in
his more important capacity as Minister
for External Affairs (for Territories die
not yet rate a Minister solely concerned
with them!) said things that read rathei)
sadly today. Australia, he said, musj
be a party to any decision about Westerri
New Guinea; the Indonesian claim to
sovereignty was inadmissible; and “the
Government of Indonesia, being un-
stable and politically immature, is not
capable of assisting the native peoples oh
New Guinea in the way required”. 1°
addition he made it plain that he be-
lieved that Indonesia would prove a
troublesome neighbor if it got into Irian,
and that no assurances from the Indo-
nesian Government that it had no de-
signs on the Australian part of the area
could be trusted.
But this Indonesian strand did not
bulk largest in our minds. The general i


pressure of anti-colonialism in the
United Nations seemed a far more im-
portant motive power pushing us along
the road of political development.
Where was that road to lead? To a
New Guinea that was an integral part
of Australia, a new State? Or to a New
Guinea linked permanently to Australia
in some special association as Puerto
Rico is to the United States? Or to a
politically independent nation-state of
New Guinea, possibly forming part, if
this proved possible, of a Melanesian
federation or union?
These choices are still more or less
open.
rrHE view I took then I have since
abandoned. I argued that Australia
should seek complete and permanent in-
corporation of New Guinea into the
Commonwealth with the free consent of
the people, who would rise to self-
government as political citizens with full
rights. I admitted some of the obvious
difficulties: the economic disparity, the
difficulty of social and cultural adjust-
ment. But I argued that incorporation
was not only the best answer for Austra-
lia’s legitimate defence needs, it was also
the best answer from the point of view
of the New 7 Guinea people, who could
not hope to maintain a strong prosperous
community if they set up political house
by themselves. Again the difficulties
that an independent New Guinea would
face are obvious enough. I considered,
at this time, but rejected as of small
value, the idea of a Melanesian federa-
tion or union:
“But such a political grouping
could have little reality. The island
groups are dispersed over a vast
stretch of ocean, and the inter-
connections are few. They do not
do business with one another, and
their interests are not so much com-
mon as parallel, e.g., they each sell
copra to Australia or Britain, but
one group would be unaffected if the
next sank to the bottom of the ocean.
Moreover, since all these islands have
similar weaknesses, putting them to-
gether would do little to solve their
problems. The only really effective
union open to New Guinea is union
with Australia.”
The reasons for my withdrawal from
My first position and acceptance of the
idea of an independent New Guinea
belong to a more recent and far more
Public phase of the debate. The oppo-
Slr >g reasons were well formulated by
John Kerr, QC. He doubted whether
die Australian electorate could be got to
ac cept a policy of incorporation on a
basis of equality—and whether the New
Guinea people could for long accept
a nything less. He argued that the worst
thing would be to beckon the New
Guinea people towards a door which
was supposed to open, only to find it
locked in their face. He pointed out
one strictly political problem that might
emerge if New Guinea had equal poli-
tical representation in the Common-
wealth Parliament. There is no certainty
that New Guinea would simply adopt
the same Lib-Lab party complexion as
the rest of the Commonwealth. It
might be that the balance of power was
held by a New Guinea nationalist group
with grievances of its own and with
views unacceptable to the rest of Aus-
tralia. Would the Constitution stand up
under the strain of this situation?
In addition to other arguments of this
sort, he pointed out that my argument
was based on Australia’s defence and
security needs, as well as on the welfare
of the New Guinea people. But Austra-
lian New Guinea is only one segment
of Australia’s defence arc—which still
included at that time West New Guinea,
as well as stretching round the Solomons
to the New Hebrides. Wouldn’t the best
solution be one which enabled as much
as possible of this outer arc to be handled
as one political and defence problem?
To incorporate New Guinea would be
to break the arc, and render impractic-
able a solution of the whole problem.
John Kerr therefore argued that the
Melanesian Federation represented the
best chance of creating a political unit
in this part of the Pacific which could,
with assistance, meet the demands of its
own people and of Australia and the
nations friendly to Australia.
John Kerr’s argument was based on
the assumption that Australian-Dutch
co-operation could become such a reality
that they could co-ordinate fast political
development in the direction of a federa-
tion and withstand the hostile and dis-
ruptive pressure that Indonesia was
exerting. We all know now the sad
truth that Australia had neither the will
nor the means to make its decade-long
endorsement of Dutch presence in West
New Guinea meaningful when chal-
lenged. Our bluff was called and we
could do nothing.
The situation, in which we now
discuss the political future of Papua
and New Guinea, is of course the result
of the collapse of the Dutch-Australian
position, as well as of the other factors.
In some ways the pressure from the
United Nations for immediate political
withdrawal may have eased—for ex-
ample, the Chinese invasion of India
produced a marked alteration in India's
doctrinaire unrealism on this issue. And
of course the present New Guinean
leaders have told the United Nations
that they want the privilege of deciding
when they are “ready” . . . But otherwise
we are almost as unprepared as ever.
Prostitution as Safety Valve?
The clamp-down reconsidered
By GORDON HAWKINS
Tn the 1890 s the Promenade of the
A Empire Theatre, London, became
the focus of a crusade aimed at cleaning
up the English music-halls. This Pro-
menade, like others of its kind, was a
large space behind the dress circle where
alcohol was sold. It was frequented
by prostitutes, their customers and a
mixed rowdy crowd of young people of
both sexes. In the summer of 1894 a
public-spirited London county council-
lor, Mrs Ormiston Chant, organised a
Purity Campaign and tried to procure
the closing of the Empire Promenade
and the bars which abutted on it.
Eventually she achieved a degree of suc-
cess. It was agreed that the bars should
be shut off from the Promenade by light
canvas screens.
The music-hall proprietors after some
initial protests appear to have accepted
this position. It was not accepted, how-
ever, by a hooligan element among the
public. On the first Saturday night after
the canvas obstructions had been set up
a crowd of some two or three hundred
people got completely out of hand,
rushed the barricades and tore them to
pieces. The ringleader in this act of
deliberate and wanton vandalism was a
red-headed teenager who harangued and
incited the mob amid hysterical
applause. His name was Winston Spen-
cer Churchill; and this was his first
public speech.
Recounting the story many years later
—he was, incidentally, the author of the
ironic comment cited above—he sounds
singularly unrepentant about this piece
of larrikinism. “The barricades were
rebuilt in brick and plaster,” he says,
“and all our efforts went for nothing.
Still no one can say we did not do our
best.” He does, however, make a
significant remark apropos of his youth-
ful scorn for those he terms “Prudes on
the Prowl”. “I had no idea in those
days,” he says, “of the enormous and
unquestionably helpful part that humbug
plays in the social life of great peoples
dwelling in a state of democratic free-
dom.”
Today, although some may doubt its
helpfulness, few would question the pre-


dominance of humbug in the public dis-
cussion of such matters as aroused the
young Churchill. Nevertheless, in Syd-
ney some time ago a lady columnist
asked whether “the alarming increase in
prowlers and sex attacks in Sydney”
might not be partly due to “the crack-
down on prostitution”. Subsequently an
editor wrote that “the number of rape
cases has increased alarmingly since the
police clamp-down on prostitution”.
More recently a correspondent signing
himself “Doctor” said, in a letter to a
daily newspaper: “Having studied the
relationship between prostitution and sex
crimes in many countries of the world, I
believe the recent increased incidence of
rape and prowler attacks in Sydney is
the natural result of the suppression of
prostitution.” All three writers went on
to suggest that the control and regula-
tion of prostitution might be more bene-
ficial to society than attempts to stamp
it out; for it provided a necessary “safety
valve”.
Now there is nothing particularly re-
volutionary in the idea that prostitution
should be controlled, either through the
regulation of the trade by means of a
system of licensed houses, or alterna-
tively by a system of registration and
medical control by the public health
authorities. And many experienced
police officers have long maintained that
a policy of suppression would, if suc-
cessfully carried through, lead to an
increase in sexual assaults and offences
of various kinds. Moreover, although
no one can say with any certainty what
is the relation between sex attacks and
the presence or absence of prostitutional
outlets, the suggestion has a prima facie
plausibility. So the whole question is
one which merits serious consideration
and rational discussion.
Unfortunately what it gets is some-
thing very different. For we really don’t
seem to have come very far since Mrs
Ormiston Chant’s day. Of course we
still have with us those who are privy to
“Our Creator’s” intentions in these mat-
ters. We still have also persons who
appear to regard almost any manifesta-
tion of sex outside wedlock as a peculiar
product of our “corrupt society”. And
we still have those who regard all pros-
titutes as tragic figures and victims .xff
“male lust”.
The simple truth of the matter was
well put in the Report of the Committee
on Homosexual Offences and Prostitu-
tion (1957), better known as the Wolfen-
den Report. “Prostitution,” the commit-
tee said, “. . . has persisted in many
civilisations throughout many centuries
and the failure of attempts to stamp it
out by repressive legislation shows that
it cannot be eradicated through the
agency of the criminal law.” The Re-
port goes on to say that whilst there are
men who demand the services of a pros-
titute and women who, “even when
there is no economic need to do so”,
choose this form of livelihood, there will
be prostitution and no amount of legis-
lation directed towards its abolition will
abolish it.
Only a difference of degree
Tn fact, although the Report doesn’t
A say so, there are a number of reasons
quite apart from the “safety valve”
theory—for holding that attempts to
suppress or abolish prostitution are mis-
conceived. It is, of course, impossible
to deal fully here with the complex
question as to how far private immora-
lity should be the concern of the crimi-
nal law. But granted that in order to
protect the young, prostitution with, and
of, minors should be proscribed, why
should adult prostitution be singled out
from other moral sins and brought
within the realm of the criminal law?
It is arguable that only an over-
idealisation of sexual relations of a
strictly non-commercial nature could
lead to such a conclusion. After all,
for real sordidness in regard to sex in
our society one must look not to the
chronicles of prostitution but rather to
the records of divorce proceedings. And
it is certainly difficult to believe that
prostitution inflicts any greater damage
on family life, or on the welfare of the
individual or the community, than adul-
tery which is not a criminal offence.
Nor are prostitutes the only “persons
who engage in sexual relations for pur-
poses of gain”. Between prostitution
and other sexual relations outside wed-
lock (and for that matter some inside
too) there is only a difference of degree.
Other considerations relate to some of
the unintended consequences of a policy
of abolition and attempts at suppression.
Thus experience shows that the prosecu-
tion of such a policy frequently gives
rise to a ruthless underworld organisa-
tion both for the protection and the ex-
ploitation of prostitutes. Not only this,
repressive measures are likely to create
among persons engaged in prostitution
a hostile and antagonistic attitude to the
authorities which must inevitably ham-
per attempts at rehabilitation.
At one time it was said that the sup-
pression of prostitution would help con-
trol the menace of venereal disease.
But as long ago as 1926 the Council of
Direction of the International Union for
Combating Venereal Diseases declared
that the conventional belief that the
prostitute was a main factor in the
spread of venereal disease was no longer
true. Prostitutes, they pointed out,
usually took prophylactic precautions.
Ordinary free promiscuity, they said,
which would be likely to increase rather
than decrease if prostitution were
abolished, was the most potent factor in
the spread of venereal disease in our
time.
A further point is made in R. L. Arch-
dale’s “Prostitution and Persecution”
(1960) which combines an attack on
the English Street Offences Act of 1959
(which increased the penalties on soli-
citing and made convictions easier to
secure) with a frank defence of prosti-
tutes and the institution of prostitution.
The prostitute, says Archdale, in pro-
viding for the odd man out, the man
who lacks the charm and physical at-
tractiveness to win a girl, performs a
valuable social service. Such men, he
adds, may be only a minority but “they
have always been among us even in
times of substantial female majorities”,
and "there are likely to be many more
of them now that the scales are tipped
the other way and young men are pro-
gressively outnumbering young women”.
This is not without relevance to the
situation in Australia, especially when
one bears in mind the disproportionately
large number of single males in the age
group 20 to 35 to be found in our post-
war immigrant population.
A style of living
for the prostitute herself, most of
those who write on this subject seem
little more realistic than the romantic
novelists with their gay and golden-
hearted whores or the so-called realists
and their pathetic broken creatures,
diseased, drugged and old beyond their
years. There is in fact no evidence that
the majority of prostitutes are driven to
adopt their manner of life by such popu-
lar “causes” as economic pressure, bad
upbringing, seduction at an early age
or a broken marriage. According to
the Wolfenden Report, “the great
majority of prostitutes are women whose
psychological make-up is such that they
choose this life because they find in it
a style of living which is to them easier,
freer and more profitable than would
be provided by any other occupation”.
Yet it seems improbable that we shall
easily be persuaded to abandon our
pride, prudery and prejudice and adopt
a more rational and objective attitude
to the role and function of the prosti-
tute in our society. Boswell tells us how
walking along the Strand one night “a
woman of the town accosted us, in the
usual enticing manner. ‘No, no, my girl,’
said Johnson, ‘it won’t do’.” “However,”
says Boswell, “he did not treat her with
harshness”. Bearing in mind the Kin-
sey revelation that seventy per cent of
adult males questioned admitted having
used prostitutes, is it too much to hope
that we may emulate Dr Johnson, and
at least cease to harry and harass them?

Degrading Search
SIR. —Recently, I was asked at the cash
desk of a leading self-service store to
open my personal handbag. I was not
carrying a shopping bag. This request
was made before the goods I was pur-
chasing were checked on the cash register
or paid for. I refused. The manager was
immediately called and he produced a
notice that is at all times prominently
displayed, concerning this matter. I again
refused to open my handbag for inspec-
tion and intimated that, should he insist,
I would never shop there again. His reply
told me that he did not insist, but that
their store could do without my custom.
There is a serious infringement of
personal liberty that both shocks and
worries me. Women must decide what
line they are going to take. Sufficient
refusals, which are within their rights,
will stop this degrading practice.

Come , Come , Mr Leibler
SlR.—Little did I realise that having
lunch with Mr Isi Leibler would prove to
be such a complicated affair. For him to
say that “mutual friends” arranged for
us to meet is just nonsense. Mr Leibler
and I made the arrangements on the
telephone after he rang me. Mr Leibler's
fanciful suggestion that he came to see
me after he had been persuaded by some
of my colleagues to make “a documented
presentation of the facts” to me is about
as reliable as his “mutual friends” story.
Mr Leibler could not name one of these
“colleagues”.
However, the nub of the dispute be-
tween Mr Leibler and myself is the much-
daunted “documented presentation of the
facts”. This consisted of type-written
statements purporting to be extracts from
Material prepared by Mr Butler. Can I
give Mr Leibler this assurance: If some-
body came to me with type - written
statements which made out that Mr Leib-
ter was anti-Christian and anti-Australian,
J would treat that approach with the
same contempt as I treated his. For Mr
Leibler to invoke Mr Wentworth to sup-
port his stand is a piece of untrammelled
humbug. Surely Mr Leibler will recall
that when he asked me for a statement
denouncing Mr Butler, Mr Wentworth
immediately reacted, saying that such a
proposition was not fair.
This brings me to offer this bit of
advice. Mr Leibler, you have an oppor-
tunity to make your charge in Mr Butler’s
presence, as I understand Mr Norman
Banks, against whom you have also made
some wild accusations, has offered to
provide radio facilities in Melbourne for
you all to get together. It would seem
to many people, Mr Leibler, that it
would be the manly thing for you to do
to accept the offer.
Finally, can I tell Mr Leibler again
that I have absolutely no ill-will towards
his people. I can do no more than say
that, but in candor I must tell him that
there is a grave risk of there being one
exception. The way he is behaving is
putting my sense of charity to a real
test.
D. J. KILLEN
MP for Moreton
Brisbane (Qld).
SlR.—Last week it was reported that
Mr D. J. Killen, MP, had asked the
Deputy Prime Minister, Mr McEwen,
whether the Federal Government had
any evidence to support recent allega-
tions that the Australian League of Rights
had shown “disloyalty” to the nation.
As a public figure who has closely and
consistently allied himself with the
League of Rights over the past decade,
surely Mr Killen now realises that Mr
McEwen is not the man from whom we
can expect a fair and unprejudiced reply.
Mr Killen’s friend of long standing, Mr
Eric D. Butler, the League's National
Director, has pronounced Mr. McEwen
to be a tool of the Jews.
In his well-known endorsement of the
Protocols of the Elders of Zion, “The
International Jew”, Mr Butler referred to
Mr McEwen's “alarming” views: “Here
is the Judaic policy being openly advo-
cated” (p. 50).
LEON GLEZER
Carlton (Vic.).
SIR. —Some people may feel that Mr
Leibler's relentless pursuit of Eric Butler
and his friends is “ungentlemanly”, par-
ticularly since Mr Butler likes to present
himself as the voice crying in the wilder-
ness. Such a view replaces sentimentality
for a reasoned moral and political judg-
ment. Non-conformity is no excuse for
the dissemination of destructive and
libellous hate-propaganda against ethnic
minorities. Anti-Communism is morally
and politically spurious if it is linked
with fascism.
In 1947, two years after Auschwitz,
Mr Butler published a book called “The
International Jew”, a compendium of
pernicious antisemitic nonsense, some of
which had formed the background music
on the road to the gas-chamber. And
there is no evidence that Mr Butler has
in any way repented or changed his
views. As a leader of the Jewish com-
munity and as a good Australian, Mr
Leibler would be failing in his duties if
he did not harass the pedlars of racist
libels.

Brisbane Heritage
SIR. —During a protracted stay in Bris-
bane, I attended, quite by chance, a
performance of an Australian play,
“Dark Heritage”, by a local writer,
Barbara Stellmach.
I feel, without hesitation, that, with
some re-writing of the first act, her play
could better such efforts as “The Shift-
ing Heart” and rank with “The Doll”.
But the lack of support given by
Press, radio, and public to this remark-
able effort makes me realise more and
more why Brisbane actors, dancers, and
(obviously) writers must depart their
lovely city to make any headway in
their careers.

Frightfully funny
SIR. —One of the most amusing and
ironical happenings to read about in any
newspaper or news magazine this year
is your “Modus Operandi” (The Bul-
letin, 17/10/64), which gave an
absolutely topping resume of your inter-
view with Senior-Inspector J. Sadeer
Zain, of Singapore Police. Oh, it really
was frightfully funny!
Here we have that frustrated, bitter
and misguided idealist, Mr E. S. (Solly)
Sachs, of 1953-South Africa, making an
Australia-wide tour in efforts to raise
funds for the Defence and Aid Fund,
and in the process, denigrating the 90-
day no-trial clause, under which various
people, European and non-European,
were arrested and put into gaol. And
on the other hand, we have Mr Zain
telling how Singapore police deal with
secret society gangsters; namely, arrest-
ing them for a minimum of 16 days
“while we build up a case against him”,
then charging them under the Tempor-
ary Provisional Ordinances and gaoling
them “for a year” without trial!
Not 90 days, chaps! But one whole
year!
Oh, it really was frightfully funny to
read Mr Zain’s comments, especially
when he says that if Australia applied
a similar treatment (for gangsters) “you
would not have half so much trouble
with your young hoodlums”. Too bad
no one like Solly Sachs is campaigning
for the economic boycott of Singapore
by United Nations countries, as he so
wilfully does to get countries to make

Goldwater
SIR.—As an American who is reason-
ably familiar with the outlook of Senator
Goldwater and his supporters, I must
plead with you for a fairer treatment of
the Senator. Your editorial (3/10/64),
which in effect accuses Goldwater of
isolationism, was obviously inspired by
something other than first-hand know-
ledge of what he has actually said and
written. Certainly the Senator’s per-
ceptive, intelligent anti - Communism
would be vastly more advantageous to
Australia, Malaysia, and other outposts
of civilisation in South-East Asia, than
the toothless, unimaginative inanities
which currently pass for “foreign policy”
in a State Department riddled with
security-risks!
Even more basic is your earlier mis-
cenception (25/7/64) that Goldwater “is
the focus of the most uncertain and
illiberal elements in the United States”.
This amounts to uncritical acceptance
of an inverted, Communist - inspired
semantics, according to which all free- (
dom - loving anti - Communists are i
“illiberal” pro-fascists, while advocates
of Socialist, totalitarian regimentation
emerge as “liberals”, “progressives”, etc.! i
(Odd that “Nazism” means, literally,
“National Socialism”, NOT “Goldwater
Republicanism”!)
Goldwater represents the sane, quint-
essential centre of the American
political tradition, which is merely try-
ing to regain its rightful place, after
thirty years of suppression by an
illiberal, fundamentally un - American, /
Socialist extremism! i

Somewhere the tin thunder of a bar shutting.
Now the questions issue above ground, prowl for all
that
satiation day withholds from them. Can we share
this foglight scurrying with them? We could walk
all night and practise not discovering. As it is
we will walk all night, for we are both locked out.
Oh, if arms could build against the dark, refurnish it,

Monroe, and while Wal Cherry’s pro-
gramme notes play this down, it remains
the centre of the story. Almost any
married couple will recognise at least
some of their problems in the drama.
Beyond this we have the soul-searing
doubts of the modern intellectual, torn
between pure intentions and moral un-
certainties. There is the baneful influ-
ence of parents on children and, finally,
the magical image of Marilyn herself.
In the play she is Maggie: a lost, way-
ward, lovely and infinitely touching girl.
Arthur Miller has handled his fascina-
ting subject in perhaps the only possible
way. The action takes place where it
belongs—in the mind. It is the mind of
the playwright Quentin, a part which,
because of its sheer weight, makes ter-
rific demands on the actor. Alan Hop-
good, himself a playwright, fills the role
perfectly. Never off stage, his slight but
intensely sincere presence holds every-
thing together. Quentin is a good man,
a little tragic; involved in a battle with
the irreconcilable forces that make or
break our integrity. Through him
speaks a world that includes Dachau, the
great American conflict about the mean-
ing of loyalty, and the needs and suffer-
ings of love.
Three women dominate his life: his
mother (played by Bunney Brooke with
an exactly balanced mixture of hysteria,
greed and Jewish maternalism), his first
wife, Louise (Terri Aldred, giving her
bitterness as well as frustrated sympathy)
and, of course, Maggie.
Quentin’s marriage with Louise is
failing. Each, obsessed by a hunger to
know who they are, cannot understand
the other. Louise is also jealous of a
stranger, Holga, a concentration camp
survivor whom Quentin has met in Aus-
tria. Holga embodies the enduring
power to accept evil. The key line of
the play is here. “One must finally take
one’s life in one’s arms.” But this is
precisely what Quentin, the artist and
radical, cannot do. Then, on a park
bench, he encounters Maggie.
She is the “absolute” woman, but,
knowing only how to give, she has not
learned to take what is due to her
human dignity. Betrayals, exploitation
and her own childlikeness have left her
utterly confused and vulnerable. Quentin
sets out to restore to her what she has
been robbed of, hoping, without con-
viction, that it will teach him the
humility for which he is desperate. They
have met too late, however. Maggie’s
misery sucks him dry. He fights a
losing war against her drug bottles and
against what, at last, he comes to see as
her mask of innocence. Yet it is more
than a mask ... it is innocence turned
against itself.
Patricia Conolly changes before our
eyes from a completely defenceless,
completely lovable Irish child into a
fated victim of beauty and guilt. She
is an enchantingly feminine Maggie,
tender and raucous in turn, but perhaps
more arresting before her rages sweep
her away. The combination of Quentin
and Maggie plays on the whole register
of emotions. The end is inevitable, for
Quentin is a man and not a savior.
Wal Cherry’s approach is extremely
interesting. He brings out both the
masochism and the brutal honesty be-
hind Miller’s conception. But the second
part lacks the deep simplicity of the
first. It is a flaw in the play that, once
the hinterland is mapped out, it con-
tinues to impinge fussily on the harrow-
ing confrontation between Maggie and
the dramatist. But it remains moving.
The tempo is right, though the set not
entirely: the inevitable ramps which the
action calls for are so built that the
actors never quite forget their feet. But
these are only minor defects.
Alan Cole’s production (for the
Swedish department of the university)
of Strindberg's “The Father” almost sup-
presses the Grecian undertones of this
dated masterpiece with a contemporary
theme —the destructive female. It de-
mands sharp naturalism but here receives
a rather East-Lynneish treatment. Lola
Russell, who has valiantly pioneered
many new plays, should not have acted
but produced, since for Laura she has
not enough depth and cunning. George
Dixon seems too young (but not too
shallow) as her husband, the unhappy
cavalry captain.

They don't make ’em like “Carousel”

Tivoli is everything that “Camelot” is
not. The blossoms on the trees are
clearly crepe paper, the houses are made
of canvas and wood, but the singing is
splendid. And although the Rodgers
and Hammerstein musical has undoubt-
edly lost something over the years it was
reaching this country, the score is still
a good deal more appealing and the
lyrics fresher than anything in “Came-

The Q Group may be getting fairly
tired now of patronising pats on the

“Nice try”. In fact, they have developed
a well-nigh unbeatable recipe for draw-
ing people into the theatre when shops
and parks beckon. They choose new
plays, which must strain a budget, and
some of Sydney’s most competent play-
ers. (And they have a wonderful recipe
for cheesecake.)
This recipe works well again for
“Squat Betty”, a silly title for a highly
diverting play in which Doreen Warbur-
ton, John Gray and Max Meldrum are
equally successful.

Winds blow hot and cold from the pages
of the world's art magazines into this
26th Annual Interstate Exhibition of the
CAS. Talent combines or recombines
elements borrowed from a brace of
doctrines, from pop Kitaj, plus shots of
post-abstraction, to illegitimate Whiteley,
narrowed into the simplest genital sym-
bolism. No humor, no fantasy, no par-
ticular compositional skill enliven the
grim dullness of conception in some of
these pieces, but the graffiti is writ large,
very large.
Assemblage-Pop is new hat, which
converts the old-abstract expressionism
1 °r impressionism, textural abstraction
. a nd the like, into harmless pursuits fit
h>r old fossils of 36 or upwards. Some
after all, shows considerable
joinery— Mike Kitching’s “The Hundred
%r Clock” for example— producing
a n effect of a piece of ye olde decor for
a Victorian pub. Nice if you like a
r to of weathering with your wit. Rein-
{ hard revels in thinly drawn decorative
hinnies with bags and appears to have it
over some of the others working along
similar lines. Man wrestling with lion
in red, white, green and blue stripes
may not be everyone’s cup of tea; a good
commercial illustrator could pull us up
with a gasp, perhaps, but not this souffle
by M. Dunn.
Turning to the decrepit productions
by the old hatters, and Carl Plate’s
“Dark Forms Light Segments” which
won the Roy H. Taffs Art Award of
£500, one is struck with a concern for
purely painterly qualities which, horrify-
ing as it may sound, might be stimula-
ting to live with. At rock bottom any
honest person is liable to tell the dubious
who say, “but really you’re not supposed
to like this” to go to hell.
Guy Warren employs equal awarness
for some of the problems of painting (is
it really a dying art?), and Louis James’
emergent fantasy rests squarely on the
achievement of European craftsmanship.
Peascod has returned to a more assertive
textural substance in “Urgent Spring”,
Raft and de Teliga to quieter form. Bob
Parr’s sculptured relief comes off effec-
tively, while some of the graphics and
watercolors give far greater support than
the elephantine things surrounding them.
Now in his 80th year, Orban has
painted since the beginning of the cen-
tury, and one is immediately disarmed
by his youthful capacity to enquire, to
grow, to turn away from past idioms.
Early work dated from 1902 shows im-
mediate talent; a small Parisian nude of
1911, real accomplishment in a territory
familiar to Cezanne and Modigliani; the
1915 still life discloses an awareness of
cubism, if not a direct involvement in it.
Post-Impressionism sets the pattern
for the decades following. A lush roman-
ticism practically engulfs the 1925 still
life and it is not far off from the Austra-
lian landscapes after Orban's emigration
in 1939. It surges up unexpectedly
from the rich pastels on black paper or
in the convoluted fantasies in line of the
last year or so. These reach out beyond
the confines of western tradition, but
they enhance, rather than deny the
image.
JOHN HENSHAW
MUSIC
Homage to Meale
Homage to Garcia Lorca. Sydney Little
Symphony Orchestra Concert. Cell
Block Theatre, Sydney.
This new work by Richard Meale is
unmistakeably an authentic piece of
music by a composer in complete com-
mand of his idiom, who knows exactly
what he wants to do and how to do it.
It also, incidentally, confirms Meale’s
standing as one of Australia’s leading
composers and as an artist whose signi-
ficance is not merely local.
Nothwithstanding its title and the two
quotations from Lorca in the score,
“Homage to Garcia Lorca” is not pro-
gramme music. It is an evocation of
qualities which the composer admires in
Lorca’s verse, created by strictly musical
means.
The work is scored for a double string
orchestra of twenty players, each of
whom has an independent part. It fea-
tures much interplay not just between
the two orchestras but between different
sections of them. The centre of inter-
est constantly shifts about the concert
platform, making the work one that de-
mands to be seen as well as heard for
its structure to be appreciated. “Homage
to Lorca” is in fact conceived in terms
of movement of space as well as in time,
though it should be emphasised that the
spatial dimension of the work is not on
the same plane as the music, but simply
provides the composer with the oppor-
tunity to create musical forms of greater
richness and complexity. In this respect
the work is similar to the third Branden-
burg concerto or Bartok’s music for
strings, percussion and celeste.
Meale’s musical idiom makes no use
of melody or harmony in the conven-
tional sense. The work is built out of
what can be called “melodic cells”—half-
articulate fragments of melody, often
consisting of only a couple of notes,
which when combined horizontally and
vertically provide means of organising
musical space roughly analogous to those
provided by melody and harmony. This
parallel is not exact, for conventional
musical categories are of little use in
approaching this work. Meale has
created a musical idiom which is dis-
concertingly free of presuppositions
about syntax or form —which demands
that the listener abandon his precon-
ceptions and approach the work on
terms that are dictated by the com-
poser and not by tradition.
The work is full of vivid, violent con-
trasts —between held notes and pizzicati,
between episodes of utter stillness and
wild outbursts of energy, between pas-
sages in strict tempo and others in no
rhythm at all. The last movement, the
most extravagant of all, contains one
section consisting entirely of glissandos,
and ends with a kind of primal noise
made by the players’ scraping their bows
across the strings in much the way that
beginners do.
But the extremes in style and atmos-
phere which the work embodies are
never mere gestures. Even at a first
hearing, “Homage to Garcia Lorca” im-
presses as a work of integrity and sta-
ture, one that demands to be reheard.

Canned Ovations
Der Rosenkavalier. Director, Paul Czinner.
Savoy Theatre, Sydney.
Le Joli Mai. Director, Chris Marker.
Union Theatre, Sydney.
Guns at Batasi. Director, John Guillermin.
Esquire Theatre, Sydney.
The credit titles of Paul Czinner’s “Der
Rosenkavalier” tell us it was made for
Poetic Films Ltd, but it’s a thoroughly
prosaic filmed record of a stage perform-
ance at the Salzburg Festival Flail, com-
plete with canned ovations at the end of
each act. The stage is wonderfully
spacious and the production sumptuous
(though photographed in rather fitful
color). Czinner has varied his camera
angles more than usual, but it’s still
theatre rather than cinema.
Dramatically the production is stylised
but hardly stylish, except for the per-
formance of Elisabeth Schwarzkopf (the
Marschallin), whose elegance even over-
comes the first-act handicap of a ring-
leted, Charley’s Aunt wig. The other
players rely on the broad, overstated
gestures on the operatic stage.
An odd, maddening, absorbing film,
Chris Marker’s “Le Joli Mai” was shown
at Sydney’s Union Theatre by a Left-
wing group, for what I strongly suspect
to be mistaken motives.
Marker’s political bias is certainly to-
wards a vague Communism of the
cloudy, idealistic kind, but as a propa-
gandist he’s a flop. His real interest is
in people and the way they look and
behave, and in the sheer technique of
filming. His habit of wandering off at]
odd tangents from the party line must
make him just a nuisance to a practical
Communist.
This edgy, idiosyncratic documentary
is always technically exciting, as well as
giving an affectionate yet unsentimental
picture of Paris and her inhabitants, j
“Guns at Batasi” only needed to be
a little bit better to be a memorable film;j
but it never quite matches the originality 1
and topicality of its central idea.
In an African state still undergoing
the birthpangs of independence, a small
contingent of British military “advisers”
is caught in the middle of a local poll,
tical upheaval. The Regimental Sergeant)
Major, an old school, Kipling-styk
soldier, cannot understand that the Brij
tish must simply sit tight and let the
Africans work out their own problems,
His outmoded derring-do almost
a diplomatic crisis, and he is left at the?
end with the bitter realisation that the(
values on which his life has been based
are no longer acceptable.
John Guillermin's direction is rarely,
more than workmanlike, and the sets'
(flimsy studio constructions varied with
scratchy stock shots) are a constant dis-l
traction. Richard Attenborough’s peri
formance as the RSM is fine. 3

The Aust. Lit. Industry
By VIVIAN SMITH
The Literature of Australia. A Pelican
Original. Edited by Geoffrey Dutton.
15s. 6d.
The last few years have seen an extra-
ordinary proliferation of studies of Aus-
tralian literature: histories, surveys,
handbooks, collections of essays, mono-
graphs on individual writers, chapters in
symposia, the founding of popular and
scholarly magazines devoted to local
books and authors. And now that Aus-
tralian literature is studied in most uni-
versities, and America (with its own
little Aust. Lit. industry) is helping with
imports, there seems to be a fairly
assured buying public for most of these
publications. Penguin’s “The Literature
of Australia”, edited by Geoffrey Dut-
ton, has just appeared to add to the list
—and for a while at least to take pride
of place in it.
“The Literature of Australia” is
closely modelled on the Pelican Guides
to English Literature; it follows their
general structure and outlay. “Its pur-
pose,” Mr Dutton tells us, “is to fill a
gap. For the first time in the history of
Australian literature it offers the general
leader and the student, in a cheap and
compact form, a critical account of the
more important writers and their works,
with bibliographies that include refer-
ences to further critical commentaries.”
It is to be welcomed first of all then as
an indispensable source of information;
as a cheap and convenient reference
book. Facts are gathered together,
many for the first time.
It is divided into three sections: Part
I consisting of surveys; Part II a series
of individual studies; Part 111 a most
valuable bibliography. The surveys
they can hardly all be called general
introductions devoted to Australian
poetry are by Judith Wright and Evan
Jones; those to Australian fiction are by
John Barnes and Harry Heseltine; and
there is a chapter on the historical back-
ground by lan Turner. Judith Wright's
admirable account of Australian Poetry
to 1920 is a model of its kind. Informed
with tact and taste, it is critical without
being rigidly opinionated and enlivened
everywhere by her fresh and individual
%w of the figures she discusses. Her
'omments on Harpur, Kendall, Bayle-
hidge, Brennan and Shaw Neilson will
tommand general assent, as will those
, ( f John Barnes on Marcus Clarke,
■ HHphy and Miles Franklin, to mention
% a few names. Barnes’ survey seems
to me to say all that one would want
to hear said on the subject of Australian
fiction to 1920.
Harry Heseltine and Evan Jones had
perhaps a more difficult task in survey-
ing the modern field. Heseltine’s
approach is essentially appreciative and
all-inclusive. He has a slight tendency
to overstatement, but constantly com-
municates the sense of unashamed enjoy-
ment in reading. Evan Jones’ approach
is less eclectic, stiffer, and partisan. I
think he was right not to let his chapter
become a mere catalogue of names:
poetry does not lend itself to a descrip-
tive listing in the way that novels per-
haps do—though this does result in a
slight disparity in the nature and the
quality of the surveys themselves.
More varied is Part II the bulk of
the book which consists of separate
“critical” essays on individual writers
from Henry Kingsley to Patrick White.
The six predictable names among the
living poets are here: Fitzgerald, Slessor,
Wright, Stewart, Hope and McAuley.
There is an essay on The Bulletin, the
theatre, and, of course, the Ern Malley
poems. Nothing unexpected here and
nothing out of place—though our con-
stant obsession with the Ern Malley
poems does point both to the thinness of
our literary scene and to the deep
cultural uncertainty and insecurity that
is such a feature of it. There is, how-
ever, general agreement about the im-
portant writers of the past and the
significant names in the present, and
the measure of agreement which this
represents is all to the good.
Of the 23 contributors, seven at least
are creative writers in their own right;
six are subjects of essays or of sections
of essays in the other parts of the book.
All except four of the writers are pro-
fessional academics. Some of the essays
are positively chatty and cute; others
almost exclusively descriptive and
factual; but the bulk does attempt
critically to assess its subjects. The
essays offer insights of varying depth
and value.
There is a marked certainty of tone
in the sections devoted to the writers of
the past —an assurance which is absent
from those devoted to the living. This
is understandable enough. The critic has
a chance to see the work whole; he is
less inhibited than when writing about
someone alive. Art is the realm of the
unpredictable—and an essay on a living
writer can become out of date or invalid
overnight by the appearance of a new
work. This has been the case with A. D.
Hope, and above all with Patrick White,
both of whom are far ahead of their
commentators. But this means that
Wilkes, for example, is able to take a
clear and steady view of Brennan, as is
Leonie Kramer of H. H. Richardson, in
straightforward essays without jargon or
pretension.
Among those who write on living
authors, perhaps only Chris Wallace-
Crabbe sees his subject as a whole. His
stylish essay on Slessor is one of the
best things in the book, valuable both
for its detailed comments and its
generalisations: “The characteristic Aus-
tralian poem is one in which there is
just enough art to hold the job together:
whether it gives voice to prophecy,
belief or intimate emotion, it is unlikely
to be remarkable for delicacy and
precision.” We are still at the stage
where that needs saying. James McAuley
has an illuminating essay on the whole
of Douglas Stewart’s work though it
might have been desirable to concentrate
exclusively on Stewart's lyrics, which
haven’t yet had the fullness of attention
they deserve. Throughout the book
there are valuable apergus : David Brad-
ley’s: “We do not sense in McAuley’s
verse a struggle with the disparate
elements of experience, but rather the
workings of a highly conceptualizing
mind in search of luminous symbols
through which its gains may be in-
terpreted and recorded”; or Wilkes’:
“Brennan is to be evaluated not as the
author of a number of poems, but as
the architect of a single poem”; or Edgar
Waters’ comments on Dennis in his in-
formative essay, “Ballads and Popular
Verse”.
Variety to the point of unevenness
seems to be the way to characterise the
whole book. Douglas Stewart’s personal
tribute to Fitzgerald will make it im-
possible for anyone to dismiss the col-
lection as being merely academic. Max
Harris’ article on Judith Wright I should
personally consider unsatisfactory in its
language and tone, as well as in its over-
simplifications. And the same applies to
Vincent Buckley’s chapter on Patrick
White. There is something increasingly
mechanical in Buckley’s “discrimina-
tions”, his weighing of positives and
negatives (“. . . on the one hand there is
something tainted ... on the other hand
there is something uniquely fine"); and
his comments on “Riders in the Chariot"’
are especially unpersuasive. But this
book should remind us that creative
achievement is always well in advance
of critical awareness.
There are other comments to make.
There is much overlapping too much
perhaps, though I personally welcome
the degree of disagreement it involves.
Other anomalies could have been
straightened out by the editor. For


instance, Evan Jones writes: “McAuley’s
‘Quiros’ can hardly be judged on the
few excerpts yet published”, while David
Bradley devotes four pages to the poem,
which was available before this Penguin
appeared. There are odd omissions.
One would have thought “Meanjin” and
its role an undeniable fact in the
literature of Australia — but it doesn’t
rate a mention outside the bibliography.
Throughout of course one wants to dis-
agree. But the contributors disagree
sufficiently for one not to have to fear
that this collection represents anything
like an orthodoxy. Let us hope it won’t
become a mere source book of potted
opinions.
Wise Old Party
Prefaces and Introductions of W. Somerset
Maugham. Heinemann. 26s. 6d.
Somerset Maugham does not like
critics. He agrees with Chekov that
they are like horse-flies which prevent
the horse from ploughing. He is puzzled
by their use of the word “competent” in
a slightly derogatory fashion. And this
is a little curious since in his essays on
writers and writing he reveals his own
preference for genuine competence over
other, more fashionable, virtues, and
because he himself is one of the most
competent of masters of fiction. Compe-
tence, when practised on Maugham’s
scale, is anything but a term of detrac-
tion.
Yet his dislike for critics is under-
standable. They have usually typed
him as a middle-brow writer —somewhat
like Galsworthy—and not very fairly,
when we consider “Of Human Bond-
age”, “Cakes and Ale” and some of his
best stories. But as an essayist (it would
be hard to call him a critic) Maugham
cannot claim originality. I don't know
why I should be always surprised that
he has erudition, unless because in his
creative work he strives to be close to
the ground, but his view of his own and
other men’s books is devoid of what we
nowadays regard as profound. This by
no means implies that it is not useful
and interesting: few better things of their
kind than “A Writer’s Notebook” exist.
Maugham, it would seem, is more con-
cerned with the world of individual
writers as reflected in their material than
with their consciousness, and the more
perfectly they penetrate it, be it ever so
circumscribed, the better they please
him; hence his unqualified admiration
for the short stories of Kipling. He
likes Henry James too, and especially,
for you can hear the man talk in every
line of his prose, and praises Katherine
Mansfield's “small, derivative but ex-
quisite talent”. Exquisite and deriva-
tive Maugham is certainly not, and
his talent is not so much small as well
controlled, but, more even than Kipling,
he explores his characters (including his
own in his great autobiographical novel)
almost entirely through situations, the
place they occupy.
He abhors didacticism. Entertain-
ment he sees as the true function of the
novel—instruction cannot be an aim of
art. This, I feel, perpetuates an ancient
fallacy, since nothing may be more
entertaining than instruction in the hands
of an artist. In any case, aims are so
mixed in every good writer that the divi-
sion becomes meaningless: was Dickens
not an instructor and Wells, at his high-
est, not an artist? Sure enough, it is
not easy to find the instructor in
Maugham. He strongly insists on the
anecdotal manner of his invention,
based on the observation of strangers,
without quite allowing for his own pro-
jection into them. Many of his figures
appear, indeed, to have little to do with
the inner Maugham, but this is decep-
tive. In “The Moon and Sixpence” and
“Rain”, to mention only two, facets of
the old maestro reveal themselves
clearly. Still, how often he stresses the
importance of beginning, middle and
end!
One might almost think him a forma-
list. But, of course, he is not. Half
a Frenchman, and imbued with the
Gallic sense of equipoise, it can’t be
said of Maugham, as he says of Kipling,
that countless men have modelled them-
selves on his characters. But it can be
said that, however his later plots give
the impression of contrivance, his
people, above all the women, are living
entities and typical of a class and coun-
try.
To many readers much of what is re-
published here will be well known. The
possible exception is the preface to the
American edition of The Complete
Short Stories. However, Maugham does
not treat of this art form with particu-
lar distinction. When he began to
write stories, about 1919, Maupassant,
of whom afterwards he became more
critical, had a great influence on him,
then to be supplanted by Chekhov and
perhaps Tolstoy. He demonstrates his
technique of observing from life by re-
ference to “Rain” and “The Outstation”.
For the latter he used as chief model a
dead British Consul in Spain, with the
result that a living one in Sarawak felt
personally insulted. He had the knack
of creating, as it were, to order, pro-
ducing for instance half a dozen sketches
of the same sort as those in “On a
Chinese Screen” to fill a given space in
Ray Long’s is the
death of the short story if it can be
beaten at its own game by the naked
truth,” he states, and this again should
not deceive us. For it is a fact that not
a few of Maugham’s convey an extra-
ordinary atmosphere of closeness to
truth: think only of his way with the
subtle terrors of middle-class marriage
and separation. They are very naked,
but the stark nudity is disguised, not
one remove from reality or experience
but miles away from documentary.
Even in the South Seas he is suspicious
of the exotic, setting it off against west-
ern commonness, and in Lambeth, at
home with the proletarians he medicated
at Guy’s Hospital, he transcends Green’s
verisimilitude to squalor by his own
brand of seriousness.
As a playwright Maugham has
suffered all but total eclipse. Yet at
one time he was the most successful
dramatist in Britain. It had to happen;
the very qualities which make him a
good story teller and novelist have
worked against him in the theatre. But |
not in the way he thinks, or as he wants)
to show in a short comment on Ibsen, i
who “brought the realistic prose drama
to such perfection as it is capable of, and
in the process killed it”. If it were true
that it has been killed the modern play- 1
goer should relish what followed after,
quasi-surrealism. But Maugham also
holds, rightly I think, that the spectator
no longer believes in the persons that
are set before him. “Realism, where
realism is out of place, has forced the
dramatists in order to hold the attention!
of their audience, to resort to themes
outside the normal run of life . . .” Whatj!
tarnished Maugham’s reputation was not
the normalcy of the bulk of his plays
but their dullness. The stage is harder
on “truth” than the printed page. Thelj
conflicts Maugham presents, unlike thoset
of Ibsen (it’s rather a ridiculous com-j|
parison) are, by and large, simply too
flatly imagined.
The preface to The Collected Plays
appeared in 1931, near the end of
Maugham’s productive period. He|
could not foresee then the new and some-!
times strange forms the drive for a)
return to normalcy would eventually
take, though he predicted the all-round
drama that includes music, dancing and
sometimes poetry which we are just be-
ginning to see emerge. There is 8
world-wide dearth of straight plays,
neither musical nor introspective moti
vation drama, and when they come again!
the importance of structure will rise
once more, but not in Maugham’s style
Beginning, middle and end are very well
but beyond this is what one can only
call resonance. Admittedly, Maugham’|
prose does not resound either, but we dcf
not expect it. What we expect and
richly get is the subdued hum of the
traffic of life. It is not a boundless life
but within its limits it is admirable, as|
Maugham says of Maupassant.
I think of him as a British Confucian.
He declares that he has not the gift of'
the perfect phrase, but he is always a;
pleasure to read. Much wisdom afld


suffering have gone into a conquest of
Lf-pity to distil urbane sympathy, with
balance achieved, and drama independ-
ent of exaggeration, and emotion
checked by irony. Yet there is depth,
too. Middlebrow, highbrow: these classi-
fications do not really serve, and the
current often flows strongest down the
middle. This is a welcome collection by
the most collectable of writers — and
with only two exclamation marks in 146
pages.

Jhe Presidential Papers. Norman Mailer.
Andre Deutsch. 31s. 6d.
A. landscape mildly undulating towards
an uncertain horizon. The vegetation
dingy, grey and uniform, the tired re-
growth one sees in exhausted industrial
areas. Over everything lies a thin but
baffling haze, through which from time
o time appear tumbled towers, eroded
umuli, that bear a dim resemblance to
the great monuments of East and West.
Fitful groups of people can be discerned,
i heir movements slow and uncertain,
heir gestures obscure. One or two are
nore sharply defined and purposeful—
hey turn out to be Ernest Hemingway,
ggang of New York juvenile delinquents,
1 and the heavyweight boxer Floyd Patter-
1 son, There is no sun and little wind, all
fsounds are muted; phenomena in general
■ are hardly differentiated.
’ Where are we? In the imaginative
: world of Norman Mailer, as far as it
: jis available in this book. It has to be
failed a miscellany, for lack of any other
'jterm, and the object of putting it to-
* ;ether has to be quoted to be believed
if it can be then):
! Since this book chooses to call
itself “The Presidential Papers”, let it
' now be modest enough to explain its
function. There are essays and inter-
1 views gathered here, a few poems, an
! open letter or two, some literary criti-
cism, portions picked from magazine
1 columns, a large section from an un-
’ published philosophical dialogue, there
| is altogether a fair part gathered of
!j what has been written since “Adver-
I tisements for Myself” was published
C: in 1959. What will not be found in
this collection is a five-hour play which
j the writer has been seeking to improve
for five years, as well as any of the
} work done on a long novel talked
| a hout in “Advertisements”. It is not
j wise to show this portion yet.
- No, these short pieces (some of
. hem not so brief —the three longest
j tot together make fifty thousand
*ords) are concerned for the most
tat, indeed were chosen for this col-
1 Won, because their subject matter is
)y concern for a President. One is of
y tourse not throwing any disqualified
devil’s wishes into the ring for one-
self, no, no, these are the Presidential
papers of a court wit, an amateur
adviser . . .
The topics on which Mr Mailer thus
addresses the Chief Executive include
Heroes and Leaders, Existential Legisla-
tion, Juvenile Delinquency, Foreign
Affairs, Dread, Red Dread, Totalitarian-
ism, Minorities, Death and Waste: twelve
presidential papers in all, with a Pre-
paratory Paper, Postscripts and Notes to
several, three Appendices, and, as pro-
mised, several portions picked from
magazine columns, and several poems in
obdurately free verse—the Table of
Contents is a collector’s piece in its
dreary ornateness and utter lack of
humor.
What are Mr Mailer’s qualifications to
speak on these topics?—for he speaks as
one having authority. Well, he is of
course the author of three novels and
another miscellany; “The Naked and the
Dead” will I suppose survive as testi-
mony to a certain moment of the Ameri-
can sensibility. Mr Mailer is in other
words a “Writer”, that portentous post-
Romantic phenomenon; one of the clan
of self-designated illuminates who by
virtue of their Writing understand and
mediate to us the essential categories.
Writers are not to be confused with
simple authors, like Shakespeare, Dante,
Racine, Tolstoy and other honest crafts-
men; writers, after all, like Cyril Con-
nolly or Gide, simply discourse, with sen-
sibilities stretched and flapping, on —any-
thing: Heroes and Leaders, Existential
Legislation, and Juvenile Delinquency
would do for a start.
What Mr Mailer has to say on all
these pressing topics is difficult to for-
mulate—-for Mr Mailer as well as the
reader battling through the crumbling
entanglements of his prose, the detritus-
littered no-man’s-land, of battles fought
long ago. Mr Mailer, indeed, isn’t greatly
interested in formulating anything,
whether seizable descriptions of what he
is discussing, or suggestions for concrete
action; when he does venture on
the latter he produces the mildly em-
barrassing utopian or anarchist notions
of an earnest schoolboy rebel. There is,
for instance, a sad fantasy around the
possibility of Hemingway’s not having
committed suicide, but rather played an
heroic game:
I wonder if it is possible Ernest
Hemingway was not a suicide. It
may be said he took his life, but I
wonder if the deed were not more like
a reconnaissance from which he did
not come back?
How likely that he had a death of
the most awful proportions within him.
He was exactly the one to know that
cure for such disease is to risk dying
many a time. Somewhere in the deep
coma of mortal illness or the trans-
fixed womb of danger, death speaks
to us. If we make our way back to
life, we are armed with a new secret.
This is a fair instance of the kind of
Mr Mailer’s deliverances about the
world. The manner seems confident and
assured, but nothing is in fact communi-
cated; we haven’t learned anything, ex-
cept the redundancy that Mr Mailer has
said this —what it means is not relevant,
for Mr Mailer’s concern is only to say it
—not, for all his cumbrous framework of
advocacy, to move or persuade us. He
represents indeed the impulse of roman-
tic prophecy, taking off in distant gran-
deur from Blake, reduced to dullness and
inanition: Like Blake, the only author-
ity Mr Mailer offers for his deliverances
is that he asserts them; but unlike Blake
he is possessed by no burning urgencies
—the fire indeed scarcely smoulders.
Things in Mr Mailer’s world are reduced
and slowed —they hardly matter, for all
his rhetoric of solemn concern; one has
an impression of tired confusion rather
than the energy of language the author
strives for.
This curious effect can be seen in a
group of motifs which recur as the foci
of Mr Mailer’s discussion of twentieth-
century life: cancer, “existential poli-
tics”, contemporary architecture, the
god-awfulness of North American soci-
ety, Negroes and Jews, and the topic of
excrement. It’s a curious list to hang
a philosophy on, but what Mr Mailer
makes of it is dull of expression and null
in content—the six-page essay on excre-
tion is hardly even boring; sex is pre-
sented as a grim duty and demonstra-
tion of maturity and virility; “existential
politics” shows a grasp of neither politi-
cal nor philosophical thinking.
A principal reason for this negativity
is that Mr Mailer is dourly determined
not to be caught by other people’s sys-
tems and schemes—so that his values
will be toughly his own, he flabbily re-
fuses almost the whole human achieve-
ment to date, in every field, in advance,
as it were. Thus in handling topics like
Communism and commercial sex (the
sort of conjunction which recurs),
nothing of moment is said in several
pages; for two reasons. Firstly, because
Mr Mailer doesn’t know what Com-
munism is, either as ideology or geo-
political activity; and, secondly, because
he is so busy demonstrating toughness,
so wary of being caught in a merely
ordinary response, that he has to pause
to make it plain that though he was “a
little shocked” by William Buckley’s
sentence “A whore practising fellatio
looks up and says, ‘Are you a Commu-
nist?’ ”, nevertheless this was a tough
Hemingway-style shockedness.
It’s very difficult to convey the numb
negativeness of this book.

Chariot
My Autobiography. Charles Chaplin.
Bodley Head. 55s.
It is seven years since Chaplin made
his last film. One might have expected
this to be the 75-year-old actor’s final
effort but, not only has he now published
an autobiography, at the end of the book
he announces his hopes of writing more
film scripts, a play and an opera.
The autobiography divides into three
sections — the first dealing with his child-
hood and youth in London; the second
with the years of success and adulation
as a film-maker; the last with his fall
from grace in the United States. Of these
three periods the first is by far the most
interesting.
He draws a moving picture of those
years of hardship when Hanna Chaplin
struggled to support her two boys. Now
and then some windfall, like a purse
found by Sydney, would allow them to
enjoy temporary comfort. But twice the
little family was forced to retreat to a
workhouse. On the second occasion Mrs
Chaplin had the first of many subsequent
bouts of insanity. The boys were then
sent to live with Charlie’s father and his
disgruntled mistress, Louise, until she
recovered.
At eight Chaplin began his theatrical
career in earnest, and he worked more or
less continuously in the theatre from then
until his second tour of America with a
vaudeville company, when he was invited
to join the Keystone Studios.
This world of his childhood (whether
or not it is accurately reported) is
brought vividly, fantastically to life with
odd, unexpected details — a room is
decorated with a stuffed pike from whose
mouth protrudes the head of another
pike it had managed only to half swallow,
and another room is adorned with the
painting of a nude and a bearded artist
in the act of flicking a fly from her
bottom.
But it is the portrait of his mother
which constitutes the real triumph of
this section. His treatment of her insanity
is poignant and delicate. At the same
time he is not afraid to quote some of
her comic remarks.
Charlie himself appears to have been
an exemplary son. The second and
longest section of the book presents him
in a less favorable light. The tone of the
writing becomes smug. He is inexcusably
patronising when he sums up the achieve-
ment of D. W. Griffith, for instance. An
autobiography is bound to contain anec-
dotes of famous contemporaries, but
Chaplin’s has far more than is acceptable.
He is, in fact, indulging in a protracted
form of name dropping. This is especially
unwelcome in that it means skimping on
his film-making activity.
In this section too, he allows himself
to become dangerously expansive. There
are numerous embarrassing pronounce-
ments on life, not only banal in their mes-
sage but almost illiterate in their expres-
sion: “Loneliness is repellent. It has a
subtle aura of sadness, an inadequacy
to attract or interest; one feels slightly
ashamed of it. But, to a more or less
degree, it is the theme of everyone.”
We are told many times of his taking
part in philosophical discussion. With
Hart Crane he “reached out mentally for
the subtle definition of his thoughts.”
With someone else he gets deeply in-
volved in philosophy and art.
This is perhaps hitting below the belt.
Knowing his background it is easy to
excuse such lapses. (And would it be
too unkind to see in them a hint of
senility?) There are lunges into a pre-
tentious, schoolgirl style. “I was not
frantically ebullient about his prognosti-
cations.” It is reported that Truman
Capote advised the removal of the word
“cognisant” throughout. He might have
included “esurient”, “kudos” and one or
two others. It is in fact a great pity
Chaplin did not submit his book for more
careful editing.
These faults are of course part of the
man, but they spoil the book’s chances
of having more than documentary in-
terest.
The third part of the book is better.
A doubtless carefully thought out ac-
count of his tangle with Joan Barry and
the Un-American Activities Committee.
Whether by design or not Chaplin pre-
pares the ground for his version of the
Barry affair by relating other romantic
adventures is which he played a similar
passive role. There is also the story of
a persistent fan who turned out, when
he was congratulating himself on getting
her off the doorstep, to be upstairs in
his bed. At any rate he convinced me
that in this, as in the matter of his
alleged Communist sympathies, he was
the victim of unfair persecution.
Chaplin is one of those rare artists
upon whom the public and the critics
are agreed. His importance in the his-
tory of the cinema and the permanent
greatness of his major films are never
likely to be questioned. This book does
not give as much new insight into his
creative activity as one hoped. One re-
vealing section, though, describes his
difficulty in making the transition to
sound films. In 1936, nearly a decade
after the first talkies, and alone among
film-makers in Hollywood, he was still
producing silent films. (“Modern Times”
has a soundtrack but is essentially
“silent”.) Realising that a voice would
destroy his famous tramp character, he
was faced with the necessity of aban-
doning him entirely if he wanted to
continue making films. In “The Gr
Dictator” he temporarily solved
problem by leaving all the talking to
tramp’s double, and it was not u
“Monsieur Verdoux” that he finally,;
successfully (from an artistic point i,
view) made the break.
On film theory Chaplin is sadly
adequate. Halfway through the b|
he announces his intention of mai
some reflections on the cinema, but
two or three pages which followj,
pointless and silly.
What is most surprising, he is
ever funny. The only good laugh coi
from one of the fascinating illustrate
(which include a superb still from
Great Dictator”). This is a snaps,
entitled “Breaking the news to Ir
Mountbatten that he is no actor”, wr
hardly needs description.
Chaplin’s self-portrait is, I
trifle flattering. Resourceful and coi ?
geous, vain, disingenuous—these i
some adjectives one might apply to .
man revealed through these pages. >
book is full of interest to the cine h
certainly, also to the general reai[
though it fails by a considerable ni g
to be one of those autobiographies whj a
take their place among the permau
works of literature. He has waited ,
long to write it, I fear.

Keeping Brokers Honest
The honorable profession of stockbrokers received a
swift kick in the pants this month from the US
Securities and Exchange Commission, which estab-
lished a definite legal obligation for floor trading
[‘specialists” (known as jobbers in London) to maintain
orderly marketing in the stocks under their control. To
the uninitiated, this means the specialist, who is permitted
to deal in certain stocks, must prevent violent fluctuations
(by. using his own funds to buy or sell stocks as a counter
'to the public trend.
l ' This may not seem a good idea to the speculator who
'wants to see his stock skyrocket. But it is designed also
jas a protection against violent price falls. The specialist is
Opposed to perform this function anyway. The SEC

Bonus Issue, But No Market
Shareholders of Freightlines and Construction Holding
Ltd, although sweetened by a one-for-three bonus last
July, have been deprived of a market for their shares since
March, 1962, and are entitled to feel browned off. This
road haulage company, which acquired Kwikasair Freight-
lines Ltd in 1960 (including the Collier Bring, Collier-Gar-
land, Collier Moat group), was “declared” by the Attorney-
General’s Department of NSW on July 11, 1963. Its
shares then had been off the quotation list for 16 months
because of failure to comply with stock exchange require-
ments (the stated reason being “late lodgment of company
reports”).
The investigation by the Attorney-General’s Department
has been going on for 15 months. The company cannot get
its shares back on to the stock exchange list until the
matter is cleared up. It’s rough on shareholders, irrespec-
tive of what the investigation will uncover.
Meanwhile, some transfers of shares have gone through
at prices around par. But the transactions have to be
negotiated privately and anyone who wants to get out has
to locate a buyer willing to take his shares.
In the interests of shareholders, The Bulletin last week
tried to discover the reasons for the investigations and how
long it would be before they were completed. The com-
pany’s secretary claims that, other than the original com-
plaint from the stock exchange about late lodgment of
returns, the company does not know the basis for the in-
vestigation. It would appear that a company can be de-
clared without any reason being given, he says.
The Bulletin suggested that, in answering questions
put by the Attorney-General’s investigators, some clues
should be gleaned on what the investigators were looking
for. But the secretary claims that he and the directors are
in the dark. He said: “The board considers that this in-
vestigation was brought about by an opposition company.”
When asked why an opposition company should bother to
do this, he said: “The instigator of the original three-man
shareholders’ committee was an employee of an opposition
company.”
Books of the company were removed by the Attorney-
General’s inspectors when the company was “declared”,
but the company took out an injunction and succeeded in
having them returned, as it could not function without its
books. The latest balance sheet states that the company
is trading profitably and has slashed accumulated losses
from £107,055 to £43,751. It apparently is having some
success in the express freighting field, which previously
was dominated by IPEC.
The secretary says that he left the company in June,
1962, but came back again in April, 1964. The auditors
have qualified their latest report by saying that one of the

subsidiaries has not been assessed for income tax and,
because certain matters are unresolved in respect of the
computation of taxable income for 1963, the tax liability
might be increased by £12,400. If so, it must be charged
against future profits.
The latest auditors’ report is tame compared with 1961-
62, when the auditors referred to the value of shares held
in the operating subsidiary, Collier-Garland (Properties)
Pty Ltd, and issues of shares to Mr W. Shapowloff and his
nominees. Principal asset, then, of the parent company
was shares in subsidiaries, shown at cost, £139,080. The
auditors said: “Such subsidiary companies have sustained
substantial losses and we are not satisfied that the present
value thereof is as much as the cost price.”
Is this the clue to the situation? Is the investigation
concerned with methods used to acquire shares in subsi-
diaries and the valuations of such shares in the light of pre-
vious losses?
Back in 1961-62, Collier-Garland showed a loss of
£33,555 while the group showed a consolidated loss of
£41,240, raising accumulated losses to £87,247. A later
balance sheet showed £108,677 deficiency arising from sale
of shares in a former subsidiary.
Auditors in 1961-62 also had something to say about the
allotment of 10,400 shares in Collier-Garland (Properties)
which, they said, was not in accordance with the articles
of association. Of these shares, 1517 were issued to
Freightlines and the balance was reported to be part of
29,995 £1 Collier-Garland shares issued to Mr Shapowloff
and his nominees, giving him a 49 p.c. interest in the sub-
sidiary. It was explained at the time that Mr Shapowloff,
who appears to be a major influence, had an option to take
up 20,293 £1 shares in Collier-Garland and he also was
issued with 9703 shares at par to assist the group’s financial
position. When the Shapowloff group’s holdings were sold
to Freightlines for £46,747 in 1962-63, this group became
the owner of more than 50 p.c. of Freightlines’ capital.
Mr Shapowloff, who has been on and off the board
during the various company moves, also was reported to
be a major shareholder in Tat Corporation Pty Ltd, which
offered 4s. a share for the capital of Freightlines. Although
the directors said in 1961-62 that the fair value of 864,881
shares in Kwikasair and 30,000 shares in Collier-Garland
at June 30, 1962, was below cost price, the additional
30,000 shares bought after June 30 for cash in Collier-
Garland were well above the face value. Subsequently,
when six companies were “declared” in July, 1963, it was
stated that they were associated. They were Collier Moat,
Collier-Garland (Properties), Frames Co. Ltd, Freight-
lines and Construction, Dodge Investments, Tat Corpora-
tion Pty Ltd. Today there are only two subsidiaries listed
in the balance sheet, Collier-Garland (Properties) Pty Ltd,
and WS Investments Pty Ltd, Canberra.
In the welter of confusion, one consistent, dominating
figure remains. That is Mr W. Shapowloff, who was a
director of Collier-Garland, was on the boards of both
Kwikasair and Freightlines when they made their takeovers
and, with his niece, Miss E. Sedevcic, was the board of
directors of Tat Corporation which offered 4s. a share for
Freightlines. Before the Tat Corporation takeover offer,
Tat was one of the largest shareholders in Freightlines but,
in the statement covering the offer, Tat claimed it held no
marketable securities in Freightlines. Shareholders won-
dered why Tat should dispose of its holding, then offer to
buy the outside shares.
The action of the stock exchange, in de-listing the
shares, apparently was designed, amid all the uncertainties,
to protect incoming investors as much as anything else.
It is unfortunate for the old shareholders who are stuck
with such a situation. But, in their interests, something
positive should be done to find a solution.
Even if some shares are the subject of investigate
perhaps these could be frozen by the Attorney-General a I
also those of the directors, if necessary, while the mate
is finalised. Purely on the side of the shareholders, the!,
fore, some finality should be demanded.

those investors perhaps over-impressed by the present vd

Mr Cameron was largely concerned to explain w

round about £stg.soo. He considered, though, that f
shortage of supply would be overtaken by mid-1965. J
This date is really not so far ahead. Australians, al!

“We can expect a firm price for some time to con?'

“that producers of some 85 p.c. of the world’s coppf
are directing their very considerable efforts to preventif

Economists the world over are agog

Residence at 10 Downing Street. Many
Shave been in Cabinet rings in various
'countries but few, if any, have been ring-
masters. The nearest parallel to come to
mind is the Italian representative of “The

was elected President of Italy. It

Club in the basement of 22 Ryder Street.
This is not quite the same thing as being
k Prime Minister of Britain who, as Mr
Harold Wilson announced well before
his election, intends to lash the economy

Ahunder rocking the economic tent, it is
how many of Wilson’s

performance is going to last. Economists
only hope he has time enough to

countries, also, in that he has promised
i,them a new deal in the British market

their development.
It is fairly obvious, even from this
distance, that in such a tight balance-
'of-payments corner Mr James Callaghan,
(he new Chancellor of the Exchequer,
Ml not have much room to move to-
wards economic innovation. And, apart
ifrom that, more radical measures like the
je-nationalisation of steel and road haul-
age seem to be ruled out of immediate
tabulations as too controversial to be
(pressed without a much bigger parlia-
mentary majority.
Nevertheless Labor can be expected
’ to go hammer and tongs to introduce
its regional development schemes, which
aim not only to achieve more balanced
growth but also a better general alloca-
tion of resources. Mr Quinton Hogg has

GEORGE BROWN
UK Minister for Economic Affairs
return to Whitehall is that Mr Wilson
will try to give Commonwealth trade a
shot in the arm. He has often stated his
intentions to re-introduce bulk buying
of Commonwealth primary products and,
unlike the Tories who a couple of years
ago looked quite prepared to barter it for
a cabbage patch in the Common Market,
otherwise look after their interest in the
British market. If he does this he can
expect British exports to these parts to
get a tonic effect. This would provide a
useful follow-up to the British Exhibition
in Sydney, as well as a cue for Mr Mc-
Ewen to press home his own strong case
for reducing our unfavorable payments
balance with Britain (see Croesus, Octo-
ber 17).
With a gallon size balance-of-payments
problem on its hands, the incoming
British Ministry needs a boost to its ex-
ports probably more than any other single
economic stiffener. Unless it happens
fairly rapidly, sterling will have to be pro-
tected by special measures. Already it is
being supported on a big scale by cur-
rency swap arrangements with Paris Club
members, though the exact figures are
not revealed. Suggestions that these, to-
gether with usage of International Mone-
tary Fund facilities, will prove inadequate
and a devaluation of sterling is at hand
look most premature at this stage. A
flight of capital from London must be
reckoned as unlikely. With the delicate
political balance, foreigners have no
reason to fear Labor will bring in
frightening measures.
Mr Wilson would probably turn to
restriction of inessential imports as a first
step if a big drain on sterling developed
and, most likely, couple it with cuts in
public investment (Mr Maudling was
probably delaying these until after the
election). Neither step would directly
affect Australia, but it would almost
certainly be reflected in lower prices for
base metals. This would reduce our ex-
port returns, notably from lead and zinc,
but this wouldn't be too tragic and it
could be a blessing in disguise for our
own users of these metals, whose prices
are sensitive to London’s.
Tn the unlikely event of a devaluation of
A sterling the authorities here would have
to think seriously of refusing to follow
suit. The situation is vastly different from
September 1949, largely because of our
huge kitty of international reserves, but
also because we could usefully do with
a cheapening of imports in Australian
currency terms. In our current tight re-
sources situation we certainly wouldn’t
relish an inflationary boost which would
follow a devaluation on the scale of
1949. It might be wiser to edge back a
little nearer to par with sterling.
Naturally there would be a loud cry
from exporters if we did this and also
from business, despite Mr Holt’s repeated
assurance, which is even smarting over
Dr Coombs’ latest modest SRD call-up.
Despite the fuss it might be the least
painful way of stopping the now over-full
employment position in its tracks and
avoiding a boil-over. The latest unem-
ployment figures show a further reduc-
tion of 4412 to 35,166, or 0.8 p.c. of the
work force in September. This is just
about as low as in October, 1960. Of
course no choice has to be made as yet
and, even though our exporters could
probably stand it, it is unlikely the auth-
orities here would create their own op-
portunity to revalue the £A against
sterling, at least while capital inflow is so
strong and Mr McEwen is in the Minis-
try, though a lot of stranger things have
happened around the globe in the last
week or so than that.
As for the consequences of Mr Wilson
for capital flow to Australia, from the
sound of it less developed Common-
wealth countries, particularly in Africa,
are likely to get priority. In other words,


Labor seems to be thinking along the
same lines as it did in 1945-51, when it
set up the ill-fated Overseas Development
Corporation (ground nuts, sorghum and
all that) and the Colonial Development
Corporation (Gambia poultry fiasco,
turtle canning in the West Indies, etc.).
Heaven forbid! This time it will have to
do better than that. On the score of
private capital inflow it is difficult to en-
visage much change from the present; on
balance there could be some increase,
notably in portfolio investment here, but
not as much as we might have expected
with such a substantially bigger Labor
majority.
CROESUS
Come Hell or High Water
Advertising’s role in the economy
A fter his searching examination of the
role of advertising in the Australian
economy in his presidential address to
the Australian Association of Adver-
tising Agencies in Melbourne last week,
it was rather a pity Mr T. R. Carruthers
had to wind up with a stiff indictment
of the Federal authorities for their
efforts to prevent the development of
another boom.
Even granting his suggestion that
there is a real need for more positive
Government indications of future
policy designed for smoother control of
the economy, so that business can plan
ahead with more certainty, does he
really believe the right course of the
monetary authorities is to be neutral in
the present situation, when, on his own
showing, inflationary influences are at
work?
As we shall see, the address was not
without inconsistent economic argument
elsewhere in dealing with the question
of consumption. But this was most
glaring at the end, when Mr Carruthers
seemed to pay only the barest lip-service
to the virtues of price stability by con-
demning the Reserve Bank's latest call
up to SRD on the one hand and plead-
ing for a more successful export per-
formance and the brainwashing of Can-
berra’s “money minds” on the other.
“Sure, there are inflationary influences
at work,” he said, “this cannot be
denied. Stemming from them we already
see, for example, rising wages and
scarcity of skilled labor. But let us
not forget we have had unparalleled
price stability since 1960.” Is it any less
important now than it has been these last
three years to maintain price stability?
And in the light of the inflationary in-
fluences he admits to be at work, is it
not reasonable for the authorities to be
increasingly cautious?
Not to Mr Carruthers, who incident-
ally is a member of the Export Develop-
ment Council. For him it is a question
of “how much longer business will allow
the money minds in Canberra to fool
themselves about what makes our eco-
nomy grow” and a clean sweep in which
“the country's development should be
put in the hands of bold, confident, sen-
sible administrators who have their eyes
on where Australia should head and,
come hell or high water, will inspire the
people to get there.”
T. R. CARRUTHERS
No, from his peddling of this sort of
stuff, there was no point in Mr Carru-
thers advertising his limitations in eco-
nomic reasoning. He would have done
better to have stayed in his own back-
yard (he is the chairman of J. Walter
Thompson Australia Pty Ltd), where his
expertise is acknowledged and whence
his observations on advertising’s role in
the economy command respect.
The keynote of that part of his
address was that the economy should get
full value for the £l2O million spent
on advertising in the course of the year.
“You know that the Australian economy
cannot afford waste in the £l2O million
it invests annually in advertising, so let
us demonstrate we are in the midst of a
revolution in advertising.” He went fur-
ther than this, however, by stating that
Australian consumers held the future
of the growth of the Australian economy
in their hands. He said “the Austral
public holds the real key to gro\|
through potential ability to lift its staij
ard of living.”
This was doubtless music in the e&
of the assembled advertisers, and 1
went on to tell them that “persuadi
the public to expand consumption j
myriads of goods and services”
“expansion that engenders renewal at
additions to plant and equipment, stint
lates research in new products and st
vices, spurs private investment, optj
up new job opportunities—all this a
more.” It was a logical step to ar«t
that this implies increased attend,
being given by advertisers and agencs
alike on how to communicate to c?
sumers in terms meaningful to the
And from that to the cost of such cot
munication, which Mr Carruthers 1
lieves should be shared by advertiss|
advertising agencies and the Govei
ment. It would mean high costs t
research into consumers’ attitudes, te.
ing of communication and selli»
appeals, and into the effects of advf
tising campaigns.
However, after recognising the advf
tising industry’s need to increase
efficiency in a world where a commu
cations revolution is in progress and
an economy which can’t afford to was

to have reconciled his first argument

As a member of the Export Couni
it is surprising Mr Carruthers didn’t f
forward some ideas on the role of advi
tising in stimulating exports and merf
said “you and I know that Austr
must be made stronger and one sure'
of doing this is by devoting more c

The requirement of giving a high
priority to exports raises the important
question whether so much emphasis
should be put (as Mr Carruthers did
earlier in his address) on raising the
standard of living as the best means of
expanding the economy. For, quite
apart from the obvious importance of
increasing exports in getting a higher
growth rate, there is the further question
of allowing for the appropriate shares of
gross national product to be set aside for
investment and defence. Mr Carruthers
can't have it both ways. If we drive
ahead on the assumption that a rising
standard of living is the key to growth,
with advertising directing its main
attention to stimulating local consump-
tion, this means that investment and
defence have to come later.
Nonetheless, the point has to be re-
cognised that, as Mr Carruthers says,
consumption as a percentage of dispos-
able income showed a marked drop last
year, indeed a movement contrary to the
predictions that full employment would
lead to an increase in the propensity to
spend and a consequent reduction in the
propensity to save. In a refreshing part
of his speech he referred to the view
that this decline is related partly to
caution engendered by the 1960 credit
squeeze and suggested that “maybe
people are waiting patiently for us ad-
vertising men to be more noteworthy,
to stimulate their interest, to find more
mature ways of talking to them. Yes,
you and I think they are waiting for
advertising to sell them more goods and
services so as to make their lives more
comfortable and more fun.”
This is an intriguing question, to
which Mr Carruthers has a challenging
answer for the advertising fraternity.
“Don’t you think,” he stated, “that in
turn advertising people could stretch our
imagination, raise our standards, learn
more about people and their attitudes,
exercise more creative discipline and use
our influence to ensure the marketing
of excellent products?”
In this spirit he threw out a number
of lines which will require more home-
work being done in advertising circles.
“The growing sophistication of Austra-
lian consumers underlines the inadequate
knowledge we and others in business
have about them.” In particular, he was
speaking mainly of the knowledge of
what consumers think of products and
the effectiveness of the language and
media of communication. “It is greatly
beneficial to ensure that the benefits of
m advertiser’s products are clearly com-
municated to consumers in terms of
own wants.” Fuller knowledge of
these would not only cut down needless
expense in advertising unwanted pro-
ducts, but would also economise on the
Use of resources in advertising as a
Whole.


A Surfeit of Accidents
The high cost of Workers' Compensation
HPhe rising incidence of industrial acci-
dents and the rising cost of accident
claims are worrying companies engaged
in workers’ compensation insurance.
These accidents, which cost Austra-
lian industry millions of pounds a year
in lost time, reduced production and
premiums payments, are occasionally
encouraged by the amount of compensa-
tion the worker can get. Under the
present system, a man can be paid as
much for being off work as he would
normally earn while employed.
The cost of industrial accidents in
Australia has been estimated at
4170 million a year, says the Metal
Trades Journal, and 95 p.c. of these
are preventable. The cost of workers’
compensation alone is about £44 million
a year. The balance is indirect costs
arising from accidents—“the hidden giant
of Australia’s cost structure”.
„ t . .
lnere IS damage to equipment, tools
and material—spoilage and material
wastage. There are replacement of
employees and the expenses of recruit-
fnent, rearrangement and training of
personnel. There are the production
losses, overtime to meet commitments,
loss of sales, loss of orders, machine
stand-down time, rearrangement of work
processes, inspections and investigations,
reports to be prepared for government
departments and insurance companies.
“And finally there is the rehabilitation
period of the injured after they have
returned to work.”
Workers’ compensation insurance pre-
mium structure is similar all over Aus-
tralia. In NSW in 1962-63 (the latest
year for which figures are available) the
estimated cost to industry of compensa-
tion insurance reached a record
£26,937,065. In 1961-62 it was
£26,445,124 and the year before that
£26,033,232.
The actual amount of compensation
paid when compared to the cost of
premiums makes it look as if insurance
companies are recording huge profits,
Not so. The compensation paid in any
12-month period cannot be related to
the number of cases arising in the year,
because many payments overlap from
year to year and in some instances con-
tinue for a number of years, occasion-
ally for life.
The following table, prepared by the
NSW Workers’ Compensation Commis-
sion, shows the amount of compensation
paid,

Workers’ compensation insurance pre-
miums are calculated according to the
insurance companies’ income and claims
experience. The Commission in NSW
fixes the maximum rate per £lOO of
wages paid. The rates were recently
substantially increased to operate from
June 30 this year. Among the highest
premiums are those for aerial crop
dusting and spraying (200 s. per £100),
canning (2705.), building demolition
(4625.), chaff-cutting (2735. 6d.), metal
working (1195.), mining (from 1355. to
2205.), timber mill yards (3575. 6d.).
The highest premium is for professional
footballers. Their employers must pay
5315. 6d. per £lOO of wages.
Among the lowest are mental asylums
(2s. 6d.), clerical staffs (3s. 6d), clock'
makers (35.), dentists (3s. 6d.), and lace
manufacturers (4s. 6d.).
The Commission determines the pre-
miums in such a way that insurance
companies should run at a loss ratio of
70 p.c. Since 1945 the loss ratio has
passed 70 p.c. only three times—in ;
1956-57 (74.20 p.c.), 1958-59 (72.84
p.c.) and 1962-63 (70.47 p.c.). For the
18 years to 1962-63 the average has
been 58.71 p.c.
A spokesman for one large insurance
company said Australia had one of the
worst industrial safety records in the'
world. “Despite all the safety propa-
ganda, posters and lectures, safety
guards on machines, appeals from the
management, safety incentive schemes
and so on, the cost of compensation
rises each year. In NSW there was a
slight downturn in the number of in-
juries compensated in 1961-62, due
probably to the scarcity of jobs, but they
are on the rise again. Workers’ com-
pensation has now reached the point
where it can pay the worker to stay at I
home.
“He can get three-quarters of his <
wage or a maximum of 10 guineas, £3l
for his wife and £1 ss. for each child. 1
So it's not too hard for an unskilled
worker with a large family to get his
weekly wage without working for it.”
Another insurance company execu-,
tive criticised Australia’s programmes oh
rehabilitation for contributing towards
the high cost of compensation. “We’re'
possibly the most backward country in
the world when it comes to getting the
injured worker back on his feet and
back to work.
“Rehabilitation itself is expensive, but
I think the insurance world would wel-
come schemes like they have in American
where rehabilitation, it has been said,
starts in the ambulance. In nearly all
cases you’ll find that training, where
the worker has been perhaps paralysed
or lost a limb, begins within hours oil
the injury occurring. Here in Australia,!
those schemes which are operating do a.
good job but they cannot cope with thef
volume of work. And once they’re re-
habilitated the scope of work available
to paraplegics, amputees, blind people
and the like is extremely limited. And
while they cannot find work suitable
their disabilities, the compensation con-,
tinues to mean costs for both industry
and insurance.”
Another insurer, while agreeing that
the structure of the compensation pay-
ments and the lack of rehabilitation
facilities added unnecessarily to the cost
to industry, blamed the medical a nd »

iegal profession for the present expense
of compensation. “They aid and abet
the worker to get the greatest amount of
compensation and stay off work for the
longest possible time. This has caused
what is broadly termed litigation neuro-
sis and settlements which seem out of all
proportion to the injuries sustained.
“Although the settlements have not
reached the outrageous proportions they
have in third party vehicle insurance,
they will shortly. Juries don’t under-
stand third party insurance, they think
payments come from some unlimited
source, and never think of the fact that
ultimately it’s the driver who has to
pay. They know, however, that indus-
try pays for workers’ compensation and
for some reason they are reluctant to
give as much for similar injuries as they
would on third party.
“Sometimes the worker will talk him-
self into non-recovery from his injuries.
One case I recall was of a man who
developed violent shakes after cutting
his hand. It preyed on his mind so
much that he was, literally, unfit to do
anything. As soon as settlement was
made, he was back at work. But not
all cases are like that. We examined
at random 20 cases on our books who
succumbed to litigation neurosis after
minor injuries. Since damages have
been awarded only one has recovered
sufficiently to return to work.”
Bogus claims, while not of high pro-
portions, have a significant effect on
compensation payments. Apparently
the easiest injury to feign is a strained
muscle, often in the back. Insurance
companies have in their files still and
motion pictures of people, with sup-
posedly strained backs, undertaking all
types of activity which involves the use
of back muscles—tennis playing, gar-
dening, lifting, painting, and so on.
Often such films, when produced in
court, can result in discontinuance of
compensation payments. But, as one
director pointed out, once the compen-
sation has been paid, it cannot be re-
covered.
Another high cost to insurance is the
hidden liabilities, the diseases or inju-
ries which flare up after being dormant
for years. If it can be medically proven
that the disability is the result of an old
injury suffered in the course of employ-
ment, the worker can claim compensa-
tion again. One example, quoted to
The Bulletin was of a man who
suffered an eye injury which reduced
visibility in that eye by 25 p.c. That
happened 12 years ago, yet when
doctors asserted that that injury caused
the man to go blind in that eye recently
he was paid a lump sum in compensa-
tion for the loss of the eye. Even if the
man had changed jobs and worked for
an employer who was not insured with
the original company it was still liable
for payment.
the last five years, the greatest
number of injuries at work in all
age groups has been in the 20 to 24
year olds. While the number of injuries
reported in this age group has been
declining, as has the proportion to the
total number of injuries, they still rep-
resent the majority. In 1958-59, 12,731
workers aged between 20 and 24 were
injured. In 1962-63 they totalled 10,856.
The percentage distribution for these j
two years was, respectively, 14.4 and
13.5. I
The age groups between 15 and 44 1
share the bulk of injuries, probably be- |
cause people older and younger than
these years are less concerned with■
machinery. However, the high incidence
of injuries in the 20 to 24 age group,
says one executive, should mean higher'
premiums on those workers. He would f
like to see an adjustment of premiums
similar to the £25 excess placed on ;
drivers under 25 (see The Bulletin, f
October 17, pages 62 and 63).
“Like drivers under 25, workers
under 25 are less responsible than older
age groups. I feel employers should
pay a higher premium for people in this
age group to offset the large number of;
claims they make.”
While claims and costs to insurance
companies for workers’ compensation,
are high, the business does not appear
all that bad. Suggestions of a system of
comprehensive social insurance met
with doubt. The insurance companies
The Bulletin spoke to said at present
it had no place in Australian industry.
Under the British set-up, for example,
the worker and the employer contribute
weekly to a scheme of insurance under
which the worker, if injured or unable
to work, receives compensation from the

Not Yet, Not Yet!
No restraints: what of next year?
]V|R Holt gave an assurance to Mr
Bolte that no credit squeeze is con-
templated, as in 1960—a message that
will be greatly appreciated by those re-
quired to plan ahead for the next six
months or so.
Yet it is obvious, with the labor
squeeze now on, that credit control
through the banking system will need to
be tighter if the required restraints are
placed on inflation.
At this stage, everyone confidently
states that no Federal restraints will
come until after the Senate election.
It is much the same in America,
where the economy pounds ahead, con-
fident that no unpopular moves will be
made until after the Presidential elec-
tion.
And what of next year?
★ ★ ★
TV/T ban time, there is speculation on the
effects of the British Labor Party
win.
Those who predicted a wholesale
flight of capital, however, are now more
restrained since assessing the very slim
majority held by the new Labor Govern-
ment. The feeling is that no drastic
Labor action will be taken when it is so
happily enjoying the feel of the Govern-
ment benches after 13 years in the
wilderness.
Doubtless there will be a greater
awareness in London financial circles of
the possibilities in a young, thriving
country like Australia. There could
even be a few takeover brews being
concocted at the moment.
■k ★ ★
could be a new advance
headquarters for some of the large
UK groups, as witness the battle plans
of the Cope Allman group in controlling
the South African company and the
Indian company from Australia.
Insurance and finance could get closer
attention, too.

I>ecord sales from H. G. Palmer were
* welcomed by shareholders of MLC
Ltd, although it is obvious that the MLC
has been placing substantial funds at the
disposal of its subsidiary to help finance
its operations. Latest move is to sub-
scribe for 500,000 £1 cumulative 7 p.c.
second prefs in H. G. Palmer. How
many other organisations wish they had
a daddy who could cough up such a
large slice of pocket-money?
★ * *
TTnited Holdings, on persistent
rumors of a larger-than-usual bonus
this year, has edged up to 475. Latest
rumor is a one-for-four. It certainly
would need to be more than the usual
one-for-eight to justify the strong rise
in price.
k k *
At a time when prices are drifting, it
is often a good idea to look for a
strong stock which is subject to a short-
age of scrip.
Sydney Mutual Insurance, the recent
flotation handled by Hordern, Utz and
Bode, qualifies as a stock likely to enjoy
scarcity value. An allocation of 100
shares was hard to come by in the flota-
tion. It seems that this is one stock
which is likely to enjoy solid market
rating, especially with the relatively high
earnings yield of 8 p.c.

Hanging By a Thread
Federal Hotels in adversity
T ast week’s annual report and balance
** sheet from Federal Hotels, Aus-
tralia’s biggest hotel chain, is an ex-
tremely worrying document for the
already unfortunate shareholders. In
discussing the Melbourne hotel trade,
whose calamitous state has been a
major factor in putting Federal’s earn-
ing rate on the skids, directors echoed
' the theme of The Bulletin’s hotel
, stories of earlier weeks that the
development of tourist traffic and the
steady population growth will eventually
improve prospects, while the short-term
will see a continuance of low occupancy
and a consequent adverse effect on
r earnings.
Any further setbacks could affect the
company’s debt position to a serious
extent. The balance sheet shows that cur-
| rent assets at £414,000 are far below
| current liabilities of £1,183,000. Within
ythe next two years, £1,235,000 becomes
(payable but only £136,000 is due in the
I same period to offset this sum. Between
[two and five years hence, £1,341,000 is
payable but only £lO,OOO will arrive in
[the coffers. After five years, £1,420,000
becomes payable and nothing at all is
shown as being due.
This apparently precarious situation is
i not unusual to the group, however. In
' past years, a new float of unsecured notes
has merely been made to meet what-
ever issue was maturing. The most re-
[ cent move was an £850,000 raising in
April last year, which went towards re-
newing issues due for repayment on
i April 30 and May 1. The question is,
can directors still attract such sums
with the company running at such a
low ebb? And what will happen if per-
formance weakens before it gets any
better? Any failure to raise money to
I repay loans may necessitate a selling-off
of assets in order to stay liquid.
' It is devoutly to be hoped that
knowledge of such a situation has not
been the spurring motive behind the dir-
ectors’ decision, revealed in the annual
report, to write some £520,000 off the
v alue of properties and licences held by
ha of the three Lennons hotels
and Toowoomba. Broad-
W:h was the most vital, losing
1142,000. Directors have decided to
fl to run the hotel profitably, following
Seated unsuccessful attempts to sell it
11 an “acceptable” price.
I Why did directors leave their devalu-
[fion move until now when, for more
than a year, they have known that
something of this nature was inevitable.
In the 1962-63 balance sheet, the audi-
tors stated that, as the Broadbeach hotel
if sold could only result in a substantial
loss, they felt the consolidated accounts
did not give a true and fair view of the
state of the company’s affairs.
The tight corner into which the com-
pany has boxed itself, and which oniy
time and good luck seems capable of
solving, does not throw an overly favor-
able light on the management. It also
brings to mind disagreements on the
board in May of last year, which went
unresolved and resulted in Mr O. C.
Shaul and Mr M. J. O’Neill resigning
their positions. Mr Shaul had been
managing director for 12 years.
No official statement was made on the
reasons for what could fairly have been
called a “split”. However, it is believed
that they centred around a policy to
consolidate existing operations (involv-
ing the sale of Lennons Broadbeach)
with existing assets as opposed to further
expansion and asset replacement in the
residential hotel field.
It seems ironic that a lack of liquid-

Annual Meeting of Shareholders, 19th Oct., 1964
Extracts from the address
by the Chairman and Managing Director
Mr. John R. Walton
Thirty Years’ Unbroken Profit Record
The net profit for the year of £1,444,905 is another
record profit. It is the twelfth in succession.
This Company has maintained an excellent unbroken
profit record in every year for the past 30 years. In that
period it has paid a dividend of 15% in each of 20 of the
years, of 12in seven years, and of 10% in three years
those during the last war 1943-5. In this 30-year period
the Ordinary Capital of the Company has multiplied 61
times and the net profit of the Company 86 times.
Reserves have been increased by £1,913,880 out of
surplus profits over the past five years.
Melbourne Expansion
The increase in net profit for the year was not as great
as in each recent year. The particular reason for this is
that our business in Melbourne was seriously disorganised
and our trading greatly hampered.
This has all been in preparation for the sizeable project
of launching the whole operation in Melbourne as
Waltons. This event will take place on Thursday of this
week.
For some years we have been working to a plan of
development in Melbourne which will now culminate
with the opening of Australia’s finest and most modern
department store in the city and the integrating with it
of two suburban department stores and nine other stores
in metropolitan Melbourne. We proceed from a sound
basis of established customer acceptance and profitability
in that city.
Retail Progress
In 1950 it was decided that the Company would be
developed fully into a general retail business which would
cater for the needs of a family and vigorously compete
with other established retailers. Progress in the field of
general retailing is indicated by the comparisons below:—
The expansion in the field of retailing reflected in the
above figures has resulted in an increase in the net profit
of the Company from £120,294 in 1950 to the £1,444,905
in 1964.
A major proportion of the sales volume of Waltons
is in “big ticket” merchandise furniture, floor coverings,
major appliances and hard lines. In this field the Company
has gained a predominance in Australia. In the last four
years Waltons’ increase in sales in this field is 92.0%,
which compares with the general increase in Australia
of other retailers in the same period of 4.3%, as revealed
by figures just released by the Commonwealth Government
Statistician.
Thirty Years Of Successful
Credit Experience
At Waltons, costs and disadvantages of credit have been
weighed against the advantages, and a sound and realistic
retail credit policy has been formulated out of our 30
years of very successful credit experience.
The credit practices of the Company have also been
strengthened by our link with Sears, Roebuck and Co.,
the world’s largest and most profitable retail company.
The latest annual report of Sears, Roebuck and Co.
shows that at 31st January, 1964, “Customer Instal-
ment Accounts Receivable” totalled $1,999,276,762
(£A896,536,700) spread over 13,061,631 separate accounts.
The soundness of Waltons’ credit policies and control
of customers’ accounts was thoroughly investigated ar.d
verified on three separate occasions in Australia by
different members of the board of directors of Sears,
Roebuck and Co., the most widely experienced company
of all in the field of retail credit.
More recently, prior to the current Debenture and Note
Issues, the Trustee for the debenture holders, Burns Philp
Trust Company Limited, mindful of its increased respon-
sibilities under the new company borrowings Acts,
obtained independent confirmation of the soundness of
the Company’s procedures for handling the customers’
accounts of the Company. The Trustee’s consent to the
issue followed immediately upon an independent investiga-
tion on its behalf by Price Waterhouse & Co.
Conclusion
The facts and figures I have quoted confirm that this
Company has made sound progress as General Retailers.
I am confident that this progress will continue in New
South Wales and Queensland and that the retail develop-
ment about to take place in Victoria will add substantially
to our future overall profits.

Elder’s Gold
/The annual report from Elder Smith
-*• Goldsbrough Mort, among many
other things, raises the possibility of a
share issue sometime in 1964-65. The
chances are suggested in an indirect
fashion, of course, as the possibility is
not exactly what one would call a
“cert”.
More than half the £69 million worth
of assets comprise advances, trade debt-
ors and bills receivable, totalling
£36 million. Directors are anticipating
.heavy demands from clients for advances
this year, so cash from 1963-64 asset
sales and the post-dividend profit sur-
plus has been retained to oblige them.
Pastoral companies are at present enter-
ing the months when demands from
their clients usually touch a peak.
However, ESGM’s report points out
that if there is any tightening in bank
lending, these pressures on pastoral
firms could easily increase, and repro-
duce the same fund shortages which
occurred four years ago. The statement
vs dated September 1, before the Reserve
Bank's most recent siphoning-off was
anaounced.
It is thus feasible that the company,
and many other pastoral houses, may
find liquid cash a bit hard to lay their
hands on if current trends continue.
ESGM's £l2 million capital, on which
21.8 p.c. was earned to June 30 last,
could well support a premium share issue
without endangering the normal 8 p.c.
dividend or, for that matter, the higher
10 p.c. which directors saw fit to dis-
tribute following the buoyant 1963-64
year.
Vigorous Pioneer
Pioneer Concrete’s ss. shares, selling
at present at about 175., appear
undervalued in the light of its excellent
1963-64 profit. A purchase at that
Price is easy entry to a company which
shows no sign of slackening.
Latest profit is £488,587—35 p.c.
higher than the previous year’s £360,830.
Earning rate moves up accordingly
from 19.2 p.c. to 22.5 p.c., after allow-
ing slightly higher tax of £275,703 (last
year £234,212) and a 50 p.c. rise in
depreciation to £454,482.
In the preliminary report directors
say trading conditions during the year
continued to improve. Results of over-
seas subsidiaries were gratifying and up
to expectations. Since June 30, output
and profitability of subsidiaries both
overseas and in Australia have improved.
There seems to be no reason why the
current year's result should not well ex-
ceed the 1963-64 effort. Acquisition of
Fitzpatrick Industries Pty, the quarry-
master, since June 30, gives Pioneer blue
metal sources right in the Sydney metro-
politan area and a big advantage over
its competitors.

two recent issues (one to shareholders at
June 30 on a 1 - for - 8 basis), together

wealth Development Bank and the
Commonwealth Trading Bank.
“There will be a short period during
which the investment of these funds
will be non-income producing and a
slight fall in the percentage of earnings
to capital for the current year is a
possibility,” directors warn.
They also mention that any disturb-
ance arising from doubts on US meat
imports has already been countered by
keeping a balance of operations. How-
ever, directors do think that “the North
American market will continue as a
steady outlet for a large proportion of
our export meats”.
The company’s 1963-64 sales, up by
16.1 p.c., were distributed as follows:
carcase meats 53 p.c.; butter 14.4 p.c.;
sundries and services 14.4 p.c.; bacon
and smallgoods 14 p.c.; by-products 4.2

Those who have stuck with the com-
pany may also feel a trifle abashed to
learn that a share issue, hinted for the
end of 1964, will not be made. The
latest profit (up from £34,289 to
£55,991) and higher retentions obviate
its necessity.
Nevertheless there’s enough in the
rest of the report, apart from the better
8 p.c. dividend, to keep shareholders
reasonably cheerful. Sales for 1963-64
went up 26.5 p.c. and the first quarter of
the current year saw them 32 p.c. above
the corresponding 1963-64 level.

aerials and accessories, radio, television

The ss. shares, now around 6s. 6d.,

Troubled Air
The markets are hardly yet able to
take much comfort from Carrier
Air Conditioning’s latest annual report,
even though 1963-64 converted a
£128,168 trading loss into a £73,528
group net profit. After wiping out the
1963 debit balance of £33,876, only
£43,652 would remain for dividend.
Any payment still looks a little dis-
tant. Directors suggest ‘"that the industry
as a whole has achieved a degree of
stability not apparent in the several
years immediately preceding the year
under review”. Admittedly keen com-
petition means a continuous battle for
forward orders. These latter, at
£3,600,000 on June 30, stood £850,000
above their June, 1963, level.
Carrier, though, does report reason-
able additions to current assets and
working capital, as well as a highly
respectable reduction of bank overdraft
by £192,775 to £172,283. Internal re-
organisation has seemingly accomplished
quite a lot.
Investors give every sign of what
must be considered a proper caution,
holding the ss. shares close to 6s. 9d.

absence of write-offs restored earning
rate to 16.4 p.c. and dividend to 8 p.c.
On present indications, directors may
decide on a full return to a 10 p.c. pay-
out this year.
According to the recent annual re-
port, substantially more undelivered
orders were on hand at September 30
than at the same date last year. Sales
and profits, for the full half-year at
least, are expected to exceed those of
1963-64. More efficient production
methods are enabling profit margins to
be restored, and further progress is ex-
pected in this direction.
The main factor offsetting profitability
lifts will be a bigger tax commitment
and the lower payroll tax rebate ex-
pected if export sales keep falling.
Despite the overall sales rise, export
drifts reduced the 1963-64 rebate from
99 p.c. to 43 p.c. The 1963-64 profit
of £98,000 was after tax of only
£12,000, thanks to 1962-63’s losses.
Forest of Issues
T>y the end of 1964-65, Softwood
Holdings, the timber merchant and
forest owner, will have more than
doubled the paid ordinary capital on
which it operated in 1961-62. This will
be the combined effect of the one-for-
two par issue in June, 1963, a share
placement made in March last, a one-
for-three par issue planned for Decem-
ber, and the recently announced one-
for-five bonus issue to be made before
June 30 next year.
However, the improvements achieved
by the company since the first issue and
those yet to come, thanks largely to the
successful takeover of certain Kauri in-
terests, will ensure that the shareholders’
10 p.c. dividend remains intact. But
naturally enough, further capital benefits
cannot be expected for some time, once
the bonus moves are complete.
Higher capital and a full tax commit-
ment, once the benefits of the Kauri sub-
sidiaries’ losses peter out, will eventually
reduce earning rate considerably. As it
is now around 40 p.c., a mere mainten-
ance of profits in the 1965-66 year,
when all shares will probably rank for
dividends, will still enable 10 p.c. divi-
dends to be about twice-covered.
Profits are more likely to improve, so
the cover could be even better. Such
being the case, shareholders may well
see a dividend lift in 1965-66. And,
despite all the recent and imminent capi-
tal moves, earnings could still support
another cash issue a year from now if
finance happens to be needed for fur-
ther expansion.

A Steamship Trading brings 1963-64

rate from 22.9 to 24 p.c. on capital

five premium issue.

SECURITY ANALYSIS
Prospects for ANI's Recovery
Current share price fair on the evidence
A cursory examination of the last
annual report suggests that Austra-
lian National Industries Ltd has at last
recovered roughly to the position of
1960. Sales are at about the same level
in money terms (after allowing for the
sales of the Melbourne Iron and Steel
Mills, which was sold to K-M Steel Pro-
ducts Pty Ltd in June, 1960). Earnings
are probably at the same level “pro-
bably” because this involves the assump-
tion that the Iron and Steel Mills just
broke even for the 1959-60 year.
There are, however, a few factors
which are not in line, one of which is
the price of the shares. In the 1960
calendar year, despite the Black Novem-
ber the share price ranged upwards from
ss. 4d. to a maximum of Bs. 7d. Cur-
rently the shares are selling at 4s. 2d. and
they haven’t risen above par during 1964.
On the other hand, since 1960 they
haven't fallen below 3s. Bd. (about half
of the net asset backing, which is now
7s. 9d. approximately), whereas in 1959
they were as low as 2s. 3d. at one time.
The question is: “Are the shares good
buying at current levels?”
' In the first instance, it is probably a
good idea to get a clearer picture of
ANl’s activities. The present group was
formed from a motor vehicle distributor,
John McGrath. This company had been
formed in 1911 and its early history is
well studded with bonus issues. In 1947
a company named G. J. Cullen Pty
Limited was formed and this company
became John McGrath Industries in
December, 1950 (the name was changed
to the current style six years later, in Dec-
ember 1956).
-This marked a turning point in the com-
A pany’s career. Net profit had risen
to just under £168,000 in 1950, from a
level of £20,000 five years earlier. In
1951 net profit reached £351,722. This
was the highest figure in the fifties. Some
sceptics might have said until recently
- that the company would never reach
this level again. The current year’s result
must lead them to think differently.
It now appears that in 1950 or there-
abouts the management decided to be-
come a supplier of automotive parts to
the then growing automotive manufac-
turing industry rather than to remain a
distributor of its products. In those days
this must have seemed an excellent idea.
Even now it is difficult for the outside
observer to understand why the company
was not more successful.
Perhaps the answer lies in the fact
that the motor vehicle manufacturing in-
dustry did not develop as rapidly as
expected. New registrations declined
from 1950-51 to 1952-53, then increased
to 1955-56, declined in 1956-57 and in
1957-58 were only 11 p.c. higher than
in 1951. Using 1957-58 as the base year,
new vehicle registrations and ANl’s sales
and estimated operating income show the
following trend:
1958 1961 1962 1963 1964
Motor vehicle
'registrations 100 137 100 168
ANI: Sales 100 82 69 79 83
Operating income 100 100 57 108 154
Unfortunately the figures are confused
by the inclusion in ANl’s figures, prior to
1961, of the sales and losses of the Mel-
bourne Iron and Steel Mills. The base
year is also perhaps an unfortunate
choice, because during the following year
two subsidiaries, namely Beverly Bright
Steels and Industries Insurance, were
sold.
A part from the extremely competitive
nature of the businesses in which
ANI operates, another problem seems to
be the low return in relation to the capi-
tal invested. Taking the last four years
only to eliminate the Melbourne Iron and
Steel figures, the following figures and
ratios are interesting:
1961 1962 1963 1964
Sales £ million, A 10.5 8.8 10.1 10.6
Total capital at beginning
of year £'ooo, B 5072 5091 5479 5749
Operating income, C 411 235 432 633
C % A 3.9 2.7 4.3 6.0
C % B 8.1 4.6 7.9 11.0
A/B 2.07 1.70 1.84 1.85
While it is always difficult to generalise,
there seems good reason to believe that
unless sales reach £lO million in any
year the company barely breaks even.
This view may be reinforced by the fact
that in the two years out of the last
seven when this figure was not achieved
no dividend was paid. However, it is
encouraging to note that last year, with
sales up by only £500,000, operating in-
come increased by £200,000.
If it could be assumed that each
£500,000 increase in sales from now on
would produce £200,000 increase in
operating income, then I would calculate
that by the time sales reach £l2 million,
earnings of the group could be near to
20 p.c. on capital. Unfortunately, ex-
penses do not frequently behave so well.
But I believe that a 20 p.c. increase in
sales above the 1962-63 level would pro-
duce a very substantially greater increase
in earnings.
Yet I also believe that problems of
financing such an increase in sales may
also be quite considerable. From this
point of view, it is a little disconcerting
to see that the increase in “stocks and
work in progress” represented 60 p.c.
of the increase in sales. A similar substan-
tial increase in stock, etc., occurred from
1960 to 1961 and it is a matter of
record that in the 1961-62 year sales
were down by £1.7 million and earnings
fell to a very low level.
JTIhe prospects of increased demand for
locally produced automotive compo-
nents must be good in view of the inten-
tion to require a 95 p.c. local content in
all cars assembled here. On the other
hand, many feel that in the short run
the demand for new vehicles may level
out.
The question posed at the beginning of
this article I find too difficult to answer
directly. I think the company has made
an excellent recovery this year and there
are good prospects for this recovery con-
tinuing (particularly if the cold forming
processes which the company has
pioneered in Australia are accepted).
Nevertheless, no investor can accept with
equanimity the prospect of yet another
dividend-less year if sales should fall by,
say, 15 p.c.
The present price, therefore, seems to
be a fair one until there is stronger evi-
dence that the difficulties of the last
ten years are well and truly in the past.

BEHIND THE BALANCE SHEETS
Priced in a Leader Class
Protector Safety for the long term
Protector Safety Industries Ltd
has made a determined bid for ex-
ports and now sells through 33 overseas
agencies, including centres as far apart
a s London, Kuala Lumpur, Bulawayo
pud Montevideo.
The company has only a small capi-
tal, yet its successful history since
achieving stock exchange listing three
years ago has priced it into a leader
class.
Certain shareholders placed 300,000
ss. shares at ss. 3d. plus charges early
hn 1962. Since then the shares have
always been at a substantial premium.
The company had a successful 21-
year history prior to flotation, speciali-
sing in a wide range of industrial safety
equipment relating particularly to the
head and face as well as the respiratory
system.
Expansion moves have included a
Talf-interest with American associates
y Fibre-Metal (Protector) Pty Ltd,
(which is manufacturing locally products
[previously imported. A branch office
has also been established in Johannes-
brg.
j Branches operate in all Australian
i capital cities, while in Auckland, New
Zealand, a factory was built in 1959 and
has operated profitably ever since. Re-
cently the company moved to larger pre-
'mises in Sydney. Despite the disruptions
normally associated with such a change,
profit has risen rapidly in each year of
•listing.
From £61,985, equal to 31 p.c. on
capital in 1962, profit has risen by more
.than one-third to last year's £84,155,
equal to. 42.1 p.c. on capital. Dividend
distribution on the £200,000 paid-up
capital has been restricted to 10 p.c.
L Much of the recent expansion was
| financed by outside borrowings, for the
latest accounts show a term loan of
t£73,737 (with £13,714 repayable in one
Hear) and a mortgage of £12,000 (with
£625 repayable in a year).
Since balance date the company has
Raised an additional £50,000 from share-
holders, with a one-for-four share issue
at par. Employees have also been given
'he right to take up an additional 16,000
s Wes. These moves lift paid-up capi-
ljl to £254,000. Directors modestly
Recast continuation of the 10 p.c. divi-
hnd on the higher capital.
The latest accounts, made up to June
, show the company to be in a parti-
cularly strong position. Bank overdraft
has been reduced from £61,784 to
£43,239, while trade creditors are down
from £67,677 to £51,625. Short-term
loans are up from £24,000 to £45,000,
though the new share issue more than
covers this.
On the assets side, stock has been
carefully controlled and is actually down
slightly from £197,813 to £190,960.
Promising big things for the current
year, trade debtors are up from £108,504
to £171,873.
Reserves, all in the form of surplus
profits, appear at £153,245, and, sub-
ject to intangible items of £34,816
(principally goodwill on consolidation)
give an assets backing for each 5s. share
of 7s. lid.
Last year’s profit of £84,155, although
high, was after making a special provi-
sion of £25,000 for export market deve-
lopment. If that was treated as an
appropriation, result for the year would
have been equal to 54.6 p.c. on capital.
Although last year's sales were a
record, turnover in the first three months
of the current year is ahead of that of
the corresponding period of 1963-64.
Expansion is far from completed, for
there are a number of major develop-
ment projects ready for the near future.
The old shares are currently selling
around 30s., ex the share issue, to show
a dividend yield of a mere 1.7 p.c.,
although earnings yield is about 7 p.c.
At this price the shares are obviously
being bought for long-term gain. This
could be considerable.
THOMSON AND SCOUGALL INDUSTRIES LTD
Winning Back to Success
Thomson and Scougall Industries
A Ltd has made a substantial re-
covery since it incurred a heavy loss six
years ago. • Sales in the period have in-
creased by 65 p.c., while dividend,
passed in 1959, has been raised pro-
gressively to 10 p.c.
The company was formed in 1950 to
acquire the business of Andrew Thom-
son and Scougall Pty Ltd, which began
operations as a maker of malleable
castings and iron founder in 1907. In
1951 shareholders placed a small parcel
of 20s. shares with the public at 255.
plus charges in order to obtain stock
exchange listing. Paid-up capital at this
stage was £250,000, all in the 20s. ordi-
nary shares.
Since then capital has almost doubled,
due principally to the issue of shares
for takeovers and the acquisition of
assets, and now stands at £487,500.
The company was quietly successful
until 1957, when it acquired a fully
mechanised foundry at St Peters from
Lister Blackstone Pty Ltd. Part of the
price involved the issue of 60,000 20s.
shares at a premium of ss. and a cash
payment over a period, reputed to total
in all about £200,000. The foundry
was one of the best mechanised in the
State.
However, the company ran into
trouble the following year, due princi-
pally to lack of adequate throughput at
the new foundry, and profit for the year
took a tumble. In 1958-59, Thomson
and Scougall incurred a loss of £82,530
and failed to pay a dividend.
During the 1958 year, £200,000 was

the holders having the option to take up
ordinary shares on the basis of one
share for every four notes held, the
options to be exercised six months be-
fore maturity on February 1, 1964.
Following the setback, the company
had a close look at its whole organisa-
tion. A large number of senior person-
nel was retired and new methods intro-
duced. In addition more land, build-
ings and plant were bought at St Peters,
financed by the issue of an additional
130,000 shares, this time at a premium
of 6s.
Arrangements were made with Lister
Blackstone for the manufacture of Lister
diesel engines and sheep shearing equip-
ment. with Lister to handle their distri-
bution. This had the effect of giving
the foundry a much - needed lift in
throughput.
The improvement was noticeable
almost immediately. Profit for the next
nine months was £66,929, equal to 15.2
p.c. on capital, and dividend payments
were resumed with a 4 p.c. distribution.
In 1961, profit declined to £37,614,
equal to 8.6 p.c. on capital, but dividend
was raised to 6 p.c. The improvement
since then has been steady, with profit
last year almost doubling from £47,276
to £89,991, equal to 18.7 p.c. on capi-
tal. Dividend was raised from 8 p.c. to
10 p.c. The result was after lifting tax
provision from £50,950 to £83,000,
though depreciation was unchanged at
£50,508.
Sales during the year rose by 174 p.c.
Continued improvement in the current
year has only been limited by the ability
to obtain suitable labor and by produc-
tion capacity in some sections of the
plant.
When the St Peters property was ac-
quired, the property at Alexandria was
sold. Arrangements were made to lease
the foundry until September, 1965. In
order to meet the demand, the company
is renegotiating the terms of the lease!

Stability with Range
HThe 10s. shares of K. G. Luke Group
Industries Ltd have always provided
investors with an opportunity to receive
fairly good returns on their money with
maximum security (as far as equity invest-
ments go) and moderate capital growth
prospects. At present they are selling
between 21s. and 225. on the market,
yielding just under 5 p.c. from the well-
established 10 p.c. dividend rate. The
scrip is being quoted “ex-rights” to a
one-for-five issue at a 3s. 6d. premium.
Since listing in 1952-53 only one other
ordinary shareholders’ issue has been
made. It was in 1954-55 and went out
at par.
Such will undoubtedly be the pattjl-e
of future years, although, depending H 1

'-’P overseas developments when changes
to the technical and research field were
so rapid and expensive that it was im-
possible, for economic reasons, for the
company to keep in step with its own
resources alone.
Just as important is the buffer against
imports which these affiliations provide.
The table illustrates only too well the
drastic affect which importing can have
on the company’s earnings. The flood
following the Federal Government’s 1960
economic measures and, more important,
the general drop off in demand resulting
from these moves, reduced K. G. Luke’s
sales to a level where profit on capital
equalled an all-time low of 13 p.c.
This is not to say that the group is
unable to compete very well with im-
ports. In fact, the opposite is more the
case. The overseas affiliations enable
products to be as good as anything im-
ported and also ensure that many would-
be competitors in fact end up in business
with K. G. Luke, instead of just export-
ing to Australia themselves in compe-
tition. It was reduced demand generally
which had the most drastic effect on per-
formance.
Again, the company has found that its
overseas connections provide valuable
sales outlets for its products, especially
during the times when local demand is
lagging behind supply. It is only in recent
years that the group has really started
to develop an export market. There is
a big future ahead of it in this field,
especially in the Far East, where the
majority of its efforts have been con-
centrated so far.
The group’s export potential is quite
extensive and the degree to which it is
exploited will go a long way towards de-
termining the rate of the company's
growth in the next few years.
The table shows exactly how steady
and secure the shareholders’ money has
been since 1959-60. The same can be
said for all the years since listing and
for many of the years to come, too. It
is emphasised again that the scrip should
be bought, firstly, for the relatively high
but safe income yield and, secondly,
though not quite as important, for capital
growth, mainly in the long term.
Earning rate, though healthy, has yet
to recover to the pre-1962 level. Such
a staging may not occur this year, unless
the company does particularly well, be-
cause the new ventures will take time to
reach full profitability before they start
adequately servicing the new capital.
Working capital is at an all-time high.
Fixed assets have eased slightly after
a period of steady growth, mainly be-
cause of the numerous small takeovers
which also account for the yearly capital
increase. Preference capital is reduced
by £3000 every year until 1968, when
a small balance must be written off.
Loan capital has been kept down, while
reserves have developed steadily. The
ploughback has been big this year,
despite the higher dividend commitment.
The dividend yield and the share
prices combine together to reflect the
stable nature of the whole concern.

Glamor flotations , and bad debts again
TI/hat are supposed to be the best
floats often turn out quite the
reverse. All those people who bought
John Lysaght at 80s. on its opening day
would certainly agree with me.
United Telecasters is shaping up in
much the same way. With some of the
most respectable company names behind
it, it came onto the market at a premium
well above that of many established com-
panies. It was a rude shock for the
shareholders when they received their
first annual report. It looked as if about
£600,000 had slipped through the
accounts over and above the original
estimates.
Another company name that was
mentioned with awe around the Stock
Exchange until recently was Deposit
and Investment. Now it would be hard
for any large company to beat its bad-
debt record.
Going back to the 1961 balance sheet,
which incidentally was the 79th, it was
stated in the directors’ report that “all
known bad debts have been written off
against current profits”.
The next significant mention of bad
debts was in 1963, when the same chair-
man, W. R. Schofield, stated that
“directors are confident that losses
through bad debts will be reduced”.
Then the fun really started. In
November, directors stated that they
had transferred an additional £187,000
to doubtful debts, but they now “view
the future with confidence”. Six months
later another £600,000 was transferred
to doubtful debts. There was more to
come, when it was stated that £2,500,000
was being written off for bad debts for
the full 1963-64 year.
For the first time in recent years,
directors took a little more care in word-
ing their report by saying “Every effort
had been made to ensure that all debts
which are bad have been written off”.
At least this gave them an opening to
tell the shareholders at the annual ml
ing last week that there were more H.
debts to come. However, directors shot

would affect the share price. A mi

THE MAN
ON THE LAND
Private Irrigation Projects
Farmers counter Government hesitations
’TI/I'any farmers along the Murray and
its hinterland are beginning to think
seriously about private irrigation pro-
jects.
Their interest has been stimulated by
two factors:
• New piping systems with automa-
ted controls may soon become cheaper.
• Academic and financial opinion
seems likely to deter governments from
entering the irrigation field or, at least,
make governments far more cautious.
No farmer, or group of farmers,
could afford to build a full-scale irriga-
tion project with channels, pumping
stations and resident staff. But are
these things really necessary?
For moderately sized areas it appears
they are not. Engineers are working on
improved pipe systems, pumps, regula-
tors and so on, which operate automati-
cally and require a minimum of atten-
tion.
One subtle difference, however, is that
these private project ideas concern far-
mers who already own properties cap-
able of being irrigated. They already
own the land. They want to improve it.
Perhaps, eventually, they want to sell
some of it off. Nevertheless, the initial
capital cost of getting the land does not
arise.
Large - scale Government projects,
such as Coleambally, are entirely differ-
ent, in that they are developed for new
settlers who must pay the Government
back over the years. And according to
certain men likely to influence Govern-
ment thinking, it is not good business.
Speaking at a recent symposium at
Leeton, organised by the Water Re-
search Foundation, the science liaison
officer of the Reserve Bank, Mr R. W.
Prunster, said a number of dry land
development schemes in operation in
Australia at present offered greater re-
turns on investment than current irriga-
tion development schemes. The virtues,
benefits and production from irrigation
had been too often over-emphasised,
without any acknowledgement of the
great advances made by other sectors of
the rural economy.
Mr Prunster said that general agri-
cultural production had been increasing
and not just in the areas of irrigation
development. Overall, the great in-
creases in production had come from
existing farms rather than from new
settlement schemes. This had been made
possible by more intensive farming
through the application of new techno-
logy, which demanded investment of
large amounts of farmers’ own capital.
In the short run, our increasing needs
could be best met from existing farm
land. Mr Prunster said that pointing to
the high level of return from small areas
of irrigation meant little more than that
irrigation led to intensive forms of land
use.
Yet wheat yields in the Wimmera,
Darling Downs and other areas exceeded
those of the irrigation areas and districts.
Sheep grazing intensity in western Vic-
toria was at least as high as obtained
at present in irrigation districts. The
farm lands adjoining Sydney were just
as intensively farmed for high value
products such as whole milk and
vegetables.
"IV/fR Prunster said that the rate of gross
return to public capital of the Mur-
rumbidgee Irrigation Area since its incep-
tion was eight p.c. When it came to
development, a number of schemes were
offering greater returns on investment
and were attracting more private capital
than those based on irrigation. He out-
lined estimated costs and returns of the
following:
• Esperance Scrub Plain: Light land
development in Western Australia, which
has been running at 750,000 acres for
more than 10 years and which has
attracted private capital from farmers
all over Australia. Gross return on
capital 22.6 p.c. and net return 14 p.c.
• Brigalow country, Fitzroy Basin,
Queensland: Total area involved, 9i mil-
lion acres. Rates of return on capital
13 to 16 p.c.
• Tablelands of New England, NSW:
Development of existing properties on
1,700,000 acres. Estimated net return
on capital 10 p.c. or more.
• North Coast of NSW: Land area
of three million acres could be developed
and current Investigations suggest tt
a crude return of 20 p.c. for dairyi
and eight p.c. for beef could be obtains
• Coleambally Irrigation Area: I
suming instantaneous development, t
rate of return is 9.8 p.c. If there is
income for three years, the return
reduced to 8.5 p.c.
These figures of Mr Prunster, !
relation to irrigation, are of cours)
challenged by people who want to »
continued government participation j
irrigation development. But as |
Prunster is an officer of the Reseii
Bank, his views indicate the likely dire,
tion of any Reserve Bank funds 6
farming ventures.
It’s possible to disagree, yet the BaJ.
ought to know its business.
Another highly placed critic of iri
gation, Professor K. O. Campbell, |
the faculty of agricultural economics t
Sydney University, spoke at the sait
symposium. He said that irrigation w*
only one way of increasing primal
production. Perhaps other method
could achieve this at less cost and gif
better returns. He warned against to
much romanticism of the virtues f
irrigation and urged a more caref£
evaluation of all the facts.
Professor Campbell said: “I belie!
that decisions on irrigation developmeiV
must be based on economic and sock
considerations rather than technics 1
agronomic or engineering principles.
“The wisdom of embarking on fii
ther irrigation development is not realf
a question of whether cotton and rip
grow well, or of the volume of watt
that flows down a particular stream, r
of the location of suitable dam sites. 1
is rather a question of whether there a!
markets to absorb the crops to be pri<
duced, and the costs which must tl
incurred to produce those crops.”
He argued that it might be better t
encourage more widespread use of in
gation to supplement dryland forage fj
livestock production in critical perioi
rather than trying to develop more inte-
sive forms of irrigation agriculture.
Campbell mentioned that the mark#
for the products of intensive irrigatid
had repeatedly been under a cloud »
recent years. Added to this, Australia)
advantage on world markets was in tb
production of cheap protein from grasjk'
not in the products of intensive agricu
ture.
Mr Prunster and Professor Campbe*
were not the only speakers at the synfl
posium. Each is so strategically placed,'
so to speak, to influence governmen
and financial attitudes that their view'
cannot be dismissed as mere theory.
In this writer’s view they both ignore
one very remarkable aspect of irrigation'
in Australia, which is that it has dor?
what its pioneers claimed for it, in

Jsense that many new settlers have been
.placed on the land.
On the other hand, many big dry land
.development schemes, including Esper-
fance, never really do seem to end up the
v/ay they start out. Big operators seem
jto get more than their share of the
1 goods. This would be all right except
(for the part that public capital plays in
the development. How many acres has
American TV star Art Linkletter got at
Esperance? How many other Ameri-
cans own “spreads” at Esperance?
Leaving this aspect aside, it will be
interesting to see how private irrigation
schemes do develop now that it seems
apparent that big government spending
on irrigation is doubtful. With a real
need now to conserve costs (no govern-
ment handouts or bureaucratic waste-
fulness), and with ingenuity given full
rein, the results may prove surprising.
Futures Market for Beef
America tackles some cattle problems
The news that American beef ranchers
are withholding cattle from market
in protest against unprofitable prices
highlights the troubles of their industry.
There has been a ghastly incident in
which one rancher, trying with others to
prevent “scab” ranchers supplying a
s particular market, was run over and
killed by a truck laden with cattle.
t No one could imagine a similar inci-
dent happening in this country.
* Maybe we did well to salvage as much
of the US export trade as we did. At
least we can now more readily under-
hand the attitude of US ranchers to
Australian and New Zealand imports,
even if their arguments are not econo-
mically sound.
I Obviously the American ranchers are
aot concerned with arguments at the
.level of economic theory. Not when a
fellow gets killed. Not when the cops
are called out to prevent rioting at
saleyards.
v Now comes news of a plan to set up
a futures market for beef in the United
States. If it works out, it will affect not
only American farmers and consumers
but also overseas suppliers such as
Australia.
The plan has been developed by the
Chicago Mercantile Exchange, the
nation’s second largest commodities
market (the Chicago Board of Trade is
the largest). A recent meeting was
attended by members of the exchange,
the US Government, bankers, cattle
(feeders, brokers, meat packers, ranchers
and others.
| They discussed ways by which the
bard-pressed American livestock indus-
try might protect itself from the slump
in cattle prices that has plagued it for
,i almost two years. The chronic price
'Weakness is traced chiefly to changing
trends in consumer buying habits and
»ew patterns in the industry. Signifi-
cantly, at this level, imports of Austra-
liian beef do not get the blame.
The quest for a cure has led to the
futures market idea. It would operate
in a similar way to futures trading in
wool —an established procedure in the
wool industry. The ability to hedge in
the futures market would transfer part
of the risk of raising and fattening cattle
to speculators willing to assume the
risk.
Ranchers would be able to sell their
beef cattle immediately, for delivery in
the future. At the same time there
would be similar futures trading in beef
carcasses which would enable processors
to buy immediately from the ranchers.
The difference is that meat is gener-
ally regarded as a. perishable, whereas
wool is almost as good a long-term
risk as gold. Quite apart from the price
structure, wool cannot decay, can with-
stand water-logging, and is a sound fire
risk. But American know-how in the
deep-freezing technique may have eradi-
cated much of the perishable quality of
meat.
The Chicago meeting was told that
American families have upgraded their
tastes in meat. They now want the bet-
ter grade—the better cuts —but this is
the kind which comes with a lot of trim
(fat), which they do not want. Many
cheaper cuts of beef now have to be dis-
posed of at giveaway prices. The con-
sumer also wants the meat in convenient
form—trimmed, weighed and wrapped.
All this has led to a reduction in grass-
fed cattle, relatively inexpensive, and an
increase in grain-fed animals. The
grain-fed cattle are fed by scientific
formulae and the feeding is, naturally,
expensive.
Most of the lean meat, used for ham-
burgers and sausages, is imported.
American ranchers have got into a pre-
dicament where their investment in feed-
ing equipment and so on prevents them
reverting to lean cattle production, even
though many may desire to do so.
The Chicago Mercantile Exchange is
confident that futures trading would
benefit industry. While there is much
detail yet to be worked out, it is thought
that futures trading may begin late this
year or early in 1965.
