THE RED PAGE
HIGH PLACES.
My heart turns to the mountains,
That I so long have missed,
The blue hills on the skyline,
Bird-haunted, sunshine-kissed.
For in my soul I see them,
The gullies golden-green
Where from the hop-vine tangle
The bell-bird chimes unseen.
And higher yet and higher
I Avant to climb, until
The trees give place to bushes
Windshorn and struggling still,
For foothold on the corrie,
Steep-sloping to the sky.
I Avant to reach the summit,
And Avatch the clouds race by—
The clouds that go so quickly,
The whole hill seems to lean —
1 Avant to rest there breathing
The cold air thin and keen.
My heart turns to high places
All men have so adored ;
The proud and lonely mountains,
The altars of the Lord.
DOROTHEA MACKELLAR.
The Utter Uselessness of Poets
It is time we had a little straight talk
about poets. They have lived on their repu-
tation long enough. There lias too long been
the impression that they are a kind of supe-
rior being, full of beautiful thoughts, and
occasionally condescending to publish them,
quaffing ambrosia—and if, sometimes, they
showed a preference for a more stimulating
drink, it should be our pride and delight to pay
for it. But we cannot OAmrlook the fact that
there has been a hideous slump in the poetry
business. Half of our poets are unemployed,
and the others are working broken time. In
this modern world the poet industry has de-
cayed, and there is no sign that the trade in
metres will ever revive. It is not the fault
of the poets ; they are turning out lines of
the same length and with the same number
of syllables in them—indeed, some are pro-
ducing longer lines than Milton: it is the
fault of modern industrial conditions. The
market for poetry is overstocked, and there
is a steadily decreasing demand for metrical
goods.
“There is,” remarks Arnold Bennett, “a
word, a ‘name of fear’ which rouses terror
in the heart of the vast educated majority of
the English-speaking race. The most valiant
will fly at the mere utterance of that word.
The most broad-minded will put their backs
up against it. The most rash will not dare
to affront it. I myself have seen it empty
buildings that have been full, and I know
that it Avill scatter a crowd more quickly
than a hose pipe, hornets, or the rumor of
plague. Even to murmur it is to incur soli-
tude, probably disdain, and possibly starva-
tion, as historical examples ; show. That
word is ‘poetry.’ ”
J*
It hardly needs proof to show that poetry
is not read nowadays—read, that is, regu-
larly and universally. There is no conscious
appetite shown by the general public for
this AUtriety of mental breakfast foods. A
man or a woman may read an occasional
book of A r erse —if he has to, because he is a
critic, or because she knows the author ; but
the general educated public does not rush to
lyrics as it rushes to the Melbourne Cup, or,
during .this hot weather, to the breakers or
to beer. If all the books of verse were simul-
taneously destroyed, nobody Avould commit
suicide, or Avrite letters to the paper, no
Cabinet Avould resign, no business go bank-
rupt, no public subscription be raised. Take
any of the efficient types that furnish the
motor force of this civilisation of ours—the
successful business man, the great inventor,
the farmer, the journalist, the politician, the
doctor, the engineer and ask them if, when
their day’s Avork is over, they hurry home to
their libraries and refresh their tired souls
communing with the poets. No ; the life of
the community goes quietly on its Avay with-
out a sideAvays glance at poetry.
It knoAvs that there is such a thing, but
it has no time for it. Metrical diction is
foreign to the modern mind; to the average
man it is like reading a good novel in the
old black-letter type. Poetry is a medieval
survival —-and the wonder is that it has sur-
vived so long. And this, despite the fact that
as good poetry is probably being written to-
day as ever before. For one thing, much
more is w r ritten ; there are 10 poets now to
one a century ago; and the Avork of the bulk
of them is f.a.q, Technically, there is a
higher standard of poetry now. But, how-
ever Avell constructed, and however beauti-
fully bound, the product is not sampled by a
curious public. And, if you think that the
reason is the poor quality of modern poetry,
are there any signs of a wild stampede back
to read the classics?
Youth, of course, especially feminine
youth, still dips into poetry ; but, then, youth
dips into anything, from Corelli and “Home
Chat” to Tennyson and the newspaper serial.
And, if it does dip, it seldom gets much
deeper than Omar. Certainly it does not
gets its feet Avet.
The booksellers will tell you the same sad
story. Poetry does not sell. Publishers will
echo it. There is no demand for poetry.
Editors of magazines know. They do not
rejoice over one prodigal poem as they do
over a good short story. They measure the
worth of a poem by the number of lines it
requires, and file it for fill-up purposes, bru-
tally branded with the number of inches it
occupies. (By the way, the bit of poetry
printed herewith was put in because it just-
filled up. This without prejudice to the
poet or the poetry-—which, as poetry, is
good poetry.) , ■ .. \
&
You AA’ould think that the poets must knotv
these facts; yet they go on Avriting poetry.
It usually does not dawn on them till they
decide that the time has come to appear in
book form. They send their little bunch of
beautiful blossoms to a publisher, with the
modest suggestion that he should confer glory
on himself by giving it to a- starving public.
He is delighted to do it, only he demands a
“publishing fee” of £2O. If you forward
your MS. to England, lower-priced labor
may do it for £l2. So practically every book
of verse noAv published in Australia costs
the poet £2O, or is published “at the author’s
risk.” And the editions of poetry published
in the case of an unknown poet are so small
that there is seldom the remotest possibility
of a profit even if every copjf were sold. Y r et
poets keep on publishing their little books at
their oAvn expense. Why? You can take
your choice between ambition, youth, hope
or vanity.
The trouble with poets is th.at they refuse
to recognise that poetry is an infection of
youth, more lasting but just as painful
as measles. Nearly every author has started
by writing poetry, for the adequate reason
that it is easier to write than prose. But
the great writers end by learning prose, am-
putating the useless wings of their pet Pega-
sus, and putting the nag to the plough. Once
poetry had a use in the Avorld—-so, once, had
the communal dance of the tribe; but these
arts of the Avorld’s youth have now been dis-
placed. Poetry has had to give Avay to the
novel, the prose drama, the short story and
the photo-play. In this busy world, metrical
writing has been scrapped ; and it will stay
on the heap just as long as the Avorld keeps
on progressing.
And the world acts on its refusal to take
poetry seriously. It regards the dead poet
not at all; and the living poet it regards as
a bad citizen. He is not doing any useful
work for the tribe ; he is wasting whatever
talents he possesses in doing Avork that is not
wanted. The reverence that the singer of
tribal songs was once accorded, aided by the
belief that the ability to compose songs had
in it a species of divinity, has insensibly
changed to a polite scorn or a careless con-
tempt. Take any poet you know. There
are enough poets in Australia for every
reader of this page to make this test. Is he
the sort of man that you would chobse for
the executor of your will or the captaincy of
the Australian cricket team? Would you
give him a job in your bank or your boot
factory? Would you lend him your best
umbrella? No; the world does not respect
poets. Do you ?
If you respect a poet at -all, it is not for
his poetry. You' respect the man, not the
feathered mount he rides. We respect
Banjo Paterson, because he has repented.
We do not respect and and
and (also ), because they keep on.
Ever notice that a poet does not grow up?
He writes the same sort of verse, only at
greater length, that lie wrote when he was
young. And, without individual develop-
ment, the Avorld would not progress.
This attitude of contempt is shown by the
appointment to the only salaried poet’s
position in the world of a man who isn’t a
poet. The Lord Chamberlain of England
acted wisely in choosing his servant in Alfred
Austin, He wasn't a poet, but he had the
makings of a good servant. He was Avorth
his wages. It was the same always. Milton
was respected as a civil serimnt. Dante as a
politician, Shakespeare as a working dramat-
ist, Byron as a lord, Keats not at all. Homer
was probably a syndicate, and even the
ancient Greeks cannot have loved a syndi-
cate. And the only poets of any value in
England lately either go bankrupt, die miser-
ably or get a paltry dole from -the State. No
birthday honors come to poets.
And is there, in this modern world, no
poetry? Lots, but it is not embalmed in
pretty little booklets. Romance is every-
where, waiting for you to Avake her with a
kiss. But reading poetry will not lead you
to her. She lights up many a novel, she
makes many a play. She waits at the first
street corner and the next moonlit night.
She is hidden in suburban sculleries (when
the nice-looking butcher calls j, her voice is
heard in the hum of dynamos, in the creak-
ing of the winch, and in the rattle of the
typewriter keys. And when two lovers go
picnicking, they need no book of verses un-
derneath the bough—unless tp sit on if the
ground is damp. They know more poetry
than ever Omar tried to tell them.
Annals of the Antarctic
The “Red Page” Editor was poring
dreamily over a review copy of "Poems of
the Pole” —the anonymous crime of some
member of the Shackleton Expedition—when
he was startled by a cold shaft of breath
down the back of his collar.
Hastily turning in his chair, he was con-
fronted by a long, hairy individual clothed
in moth-eaten fur boots, several blankets, a
bedraggled white fur-boa, and a tourist’s cap
with flaps for the ears. The apparition
clapped down a bundle of tattered MSS. on
the desk, and stood swaying to and fro in
impressive silence, one paw placed Napoleon-
wise within its -bosom.
The Editor spread ’out the stained and
ragged sheets, and, with a thrill of horror
read :
BULLETIN EXPEDITION TO SOUTH
POLE.
REPORT OF SOLE SURVIVOR.
TERRIBLE CATASTROPHES AND
PRIVATIONS.
HOP EATEN BY CANNIBALS.
HOP’S UNDERSTUDY ASSASSINATED.
HENRY HORSECOLLAIi REACHES
POLE.
THE CITY OF INSUFFERABLE
BLOWFLIES.
“As all the’ world knows The Bulletin Ex-
pedition to the Pole started, irom the office
at 4 p.m., Publishing Day, last week in
March, 1911.
“For the inception of the whole disastrous
affair a man named E. J. Brady was re-
sponsible. Attired as a buccaneer, this per-
son called upon the Editor one quiet after-
noon, and sp wrought upon that guileless in-
dividual that he, too, became infected with
the craving for adventure. The mania
spread like wildfire throughout the office.
Within an hour Mr. Henry Ilorsecollar. as
chairman, addressed a huge monster meeting,
comprising the entire stall’ and every one of
the outside contributors within a radius of
five miles (lured by the simple method of a
large sky-sign on the office roof: —-‘FREE
BEER TO-DAY.’)- Amid roars, yells,
stamping, clapping, revolver-shots and gen-
eral patriotic ecstasy, it was decided to out-
wit the rumored Japanese Polar Expedition
by making a start that very afternoon.
“A scene of extraordinary activity en-
sued. For the procession to the wharf the
curators of the Zoological Gardens kindly
lent a large number of suitable animals;
while a telephonic message to Garden Island
requesting the loan of some seaworthy vessel,
otherwise useless, had resulted in the gift to
the Expedition of the Powerful. Drawn
up at the Milson’s Point Ferry wharf, the
ironclad was quickly loaded with a cargo of
tinned tomatoes and bottled stout, so that, by
the time the procession arrived, all was in
readiness for putting to sea.
“The awe-inspiring spectacle of the pro-
cession down lower George-street will not
readily be forgotten. At the head, pedalling
with terrific energy, appeared Henry Horse-
collar upon a tricycle ; the rear was whipped
in by ‘Kodak’ on an undertaker’s hack.
R-nd-lph B-df-d charged fiercely down the
road on a wild bull, closely followed by the
Religious Editor on a well-thought-out jim-
jam. With characteristic modesty, Gr-nt
11-rv-y chose a whited elephant, slashed
with scarlet stripes and silver spangles.
Hop was seen to advantage on a giraffe, and
McCr-e on a unicorn; while Ad-ms, in be-
fitting dignity was drawn in a closed peram-
bulator by Newfoundland dogs. The din
was terrific. Fifty-four casualties occurred
on the way down, and every shop-window on
the route was broken.
“At the wharf there was further confusion.
Cages had been provided for the poets, but
many of these animals managed to elude
their keepers, and ran about biting the ears
of the bystanders. At last, however, they
Were -caged; the anchor was raised; and
amid a shower of cheers, confetti, old boots
and banana-skins the Powerful slowly forged
its way out of the Harbor into the open sea.
“April 2. —At sea. Poets all very busy to-
day. Captain fell overboard at first sight of
B-njo I’-t-rs-n, and not again seen. Very
fine and warm.
“April 7. —Terrible scene this morning.
Duel between Gr-nt 11-rv-y and an Ac-tor
over affections of Mary McCommonwealth ;
Ac-tor won in second round with backhander
to stomach. Lady much upset, and on being-
escorted to cabin by B-rn-d O’D-d bit him
in syllabus. Barometer 33.4; thermometer
50.7; gasometer (after each combatant ex-
plained how he Avon fight) choked at 4000.
“April 10. —Barmen busy to-day, in pre-
paration for to-morrow, which is 11-nry
L-ws-n’s birthday.
“April 11.— BIO! !!
“April 15. —First icebergs sighted. Poets
much affected by cold, snarling and biting at
each other from cages ; bottled stout served
out to keepers.
“April 16. —Disgraceful occurrence for-
Avard, where Mr. Kodak has been eking, out
precarious existence taking in boardefs. Hop
discovered endeavoring to shoot moon by
lowering into small boat his sole possession,
an ancient fiddle. Apology to' Mr. Kodak—
forgiven. Full moon, much flying-fish.
“April 21. —Bitterly cold. Ship’s corn-
pany gathered round galley-fire, where
Q-mi brewed, bowl of Harbor Hunch. Sud-
den cry of 'Land ho!' at seven bells ; snow-
clad cliffs to S.E. l’oets very excited, bark-
ing find straining to get loose. Bottled beer
(double rations) served to keepers, and all
other preparations made for disembarking
to-morrow.
“A pril 22. —Safely disembarked. and
sledge-journey southwards begun. Several
poets uncaged for exercise. Small unbranded
Maoriland bard crept into crevice and re-
fused to come out. B-rtr-m St-v-ns sum-
moned as expert, very elegantly recovered
poet by simple method of drawing him forth
after loaded beer-bottle, on string. Glaciers
troublesome, 7 exotie bards disappearing in
snowstorm.
“Mqy 10.— Nearing Pole, office-boy making
it half-column distant by office foot-rule.
Deplorable fatality at Beer-time to-day.
Strange white object on horizon, very
bloated-looking. Loud cry of ‘Fatman !’ from
black-and-white artists, and great rush to
caricature same, during which Hop’s Under-
study struck by bottle and expired. Hop
much cheered by event, and fiddled till mid-
night when stunned (much jto general satis-
faction) by heavy blow from B-11-r-ve's MS.
“ May 11. —Wonderful discovery. Same
white object as seen yesterday rushed
straight at caravan and overturned, where
it lay buzzing angrily and roaring out some-
thing that sounded like ‘Another interfer-
ence with the rights of the States!’ Cap-
tured and found to be fat white insect, of
Blowfly type, as large as a man. Govern-
ment Insectologist classifies beast as States-
Ilights Insect, driven to frozen South by
spread of Federal sentiment in Australia.
Cowed by being shown fly-paper, and sul-
lenly agreed to guide Expedition to South
Pole and its home, the Great White City of
Insufferable Blowflies.
“May 12. —At mid-day halt to-day, repre-
hensible conduct by li-d-r-c Q-nn. While
beer was being cut up with axes, Q-nn, not-
withstanding orders to shun Insect, seen to
take same aside and hold him affectionately
by front paw, gazing dreamily into his eyes.
At midnight, camp aroused by Q-nn reciting
new-laid poem in moonlight:—
He gave a buzz, and I gave a whoop,
And well meet perhaps never hereafter;
So many poor Blowflies end up in the soup
That it’s scarcely a subject for laughter.
(Great laughter, in which Blowfly joined.)
“May 13. —Reached Pole, in barren plain :
Mr. 11orsecollar taking possession of same,
in name of Federated Australia. During
confusion, captured Insect escaped. Return-
ing, found Blowfly deputation waiting. Ex-
pedition (disguised as Fatmen by pushing
pillows under waistcoats) greeted by flowery
insect named IX Kin (whispered to be re-
formed Federalist), and in reply O’D-wd,
disguised as Bruce Smith, orated a few abso-
lutely cryptic polysyllables. Great cheering.
All taken to Fatmens’ Club, in omni-buzz.
“May Ilf, —Visit chief sights of city.
Blowflies live ip five separate towns, sharply
divided from each other, and each at daggers
drawn with all its neighbors. By this ar-
rangement they assert they get their w T ork
much better done than it would be other-
wise performed. E. J. Br-dy very »
pointed out that by all uniting under one
control state of affairs would be much sim-
plified. Loud and angry buzzing from r
sects, shouts of ‘Sosh ! Sosh!! Down with
the Federalists!!’ Great Drawl : Blue-
bottles called in, whole Expedition arrested
as'Anarchists, Br-dy lynched.
“May 15.— A1l lost. In cells all night, In-
sect crowd roaring outside ‘Death to the
Unificators !’ Comrades insane with terror;
Kodak singing hymfis of childhood, Q-nn
writing prose. Hop fiddling ‘Yankee Doodle’
in corner. McCr-e turned bald in a single
night with fear. Loud sounds outside of
flesh-pots and boiling oil being prepared.
Blowfly chaplain called; exhorted us to re-
pent of our terrible Australianity, and re-
vealed nature of death-sentence. We are to
he eaten alive. . .
“ June 1. —-Aboard whaler, homeward
bound, after privations impossible to de-
scribe. Escaped by stunning warder with
Daily Telegraph leader, disguising self as
alderman, insulting Mayor, and so getting
removed from city precincts. Last sight that
greeted my eyes was Hop, covered with
bread-crumbs and beautifully fried, being
fished from frying-pan by waiters”
The Red Page Editor could read no more.
Tears streamed from his eyes at the thought
of that Antarctic meal- —poets and artists
butchered to make a Blowfly holiday! Then
the sky burst into 4000 comets, a crash
sounded throughout his skull, and he picked
himself up, rubbing his eyes.
The room was empty. He had fallen out of
his chair,
A look of disappointment stole upon his
noble countenance as he strode to the win-
doiv, where there was a Blowfly- singing
contentedly on Lie pane.
With a muttered curse he pulled forth his
tablets, and in a shaky hand wrote
“Memo. — Office-hoy to lay [nsectibane im-
mediately.”

CATTLE SCENE , GRANTHAM, S.Q.
Our Greatest Wants Population,
Queensland is the cynosure of all eyes at the present moment. The
reasons therefor are the unprecedented prosperity it has enjoyed for years
past, the glorious opportunities it offers to all new arrivals, possessing thrift
and grit, to become prosperous, the vastness of' its resources, the fertility of
its soil, the singularly varied character of the crops raised, the evenness of the
rainfall, and the genial and invigorating nature of its climate. With an area
of 670,500 square miles, or, in other words, 429,120,000 acres, the State has a
population of only 613,464; therefore, there is room for millions more people,
and Queensland invites desirable immigrants to settle within her borders and
enjoy the good things which Nature has so lavishly bestowed upon her. There
is a remarkably buoyant feeling in every branch of commercial and industrial
life, the conditions of the workers are satisfactory, and there is a great demand
for labor.

Our Most Valuable Asset : The Soil.
Queensland stands alone on account of its liberality in regard to the con-
ditions under which land may be taken up. Despite the fertility of the scrub and
river flats land, and their close proximity to railway and shipping communication
in many instances, the State offers them to intending settlers at prices ranging
from £2 to £5 per acre. At the present time there are 6,235,656 acres open
for selection under the various modes. Agricultural farms may be taken up in
areas aggregating 2560 acres, and the payments therefor extend over a period
of 20 years. The purchasing price ranges from 10s. per acre upwards; the
annual rent is one-fortieth of the purchasing price, and is credited as part
payment thereof. Grazing selections may be obtained in blocks up to 60,000
acres on lease for 14, 21, or 28 years, at an average rental of per acre.

The North Coast Railway will, when completed, give a continuous line
from Brisbane to Cairns, and the present gaps, totalling 454 miles, will then
be filled up. Practically all the country en route is suitable for close settle-

In addition to these lines, several are being built to agricultural districts.
The total cost of the lines under construction, and approved, will amount

A TYPICAL VICTORIAN DAIRY FARM.
Farms ®. Homes for the People.
UNDER the provisions of the Closer Settlement Acts the Victorian
Government has power to purchase privately-owned Estates in the
country districts for subdivision into Farm and Agricultural Laborers’ Allot-
ments, and near the cities and large centres of population into Residence Sites
for working men. No unsatisfactory ballot is held; the applicants are called
before a Local Land Board, and after a judicial hearing, the Land is allotted
to those who are likely to make the best use of it. The areas are not arbitrarily
fixed at so many acres, but are based on a maximum value, so that every
applicant may be sure of getting an allotment of a reasonable extent, whatever
the class of land may be.
This Act also provides for assistance to Settlers in the form of advances
of money to enable them to carry out the improvement conditions. Eesidence
on the allotments held by a lessee is compulsory.
The land is sold under Conditional Purchase Lease, extending over a
period of years; the payments are therefore low, being equal to only six
pet cent, per annum on the value of the land, and are made in two half-yearly
instalments of three per cent. These payments, spread over the term of the
lease, repay the whole of the principal and also interest at the rate of four-and-
a-half per cent, per annum.
ASSISTANCE TO SETTLERS.
Advances up to 60 per cent, of the value of the improvements effected by them
may be granted to lessees, whether farmers, agricultural laborers of work-
men, to assist in the development and working of the land. Thes.e advances
are repayable over a period not exceeding 15 years, and - bear 5 'per cent,
interest.
PAYMENTS IN ADVANCE may be made at any time, and a propor-
tionate amount of interest saved thereby.
INTEREST IS ONLY CHARGED on the actual amount owing from
time to time.
EVERY INDUCEMENT IS HELD OUT.by the Government to people
to settle on the land, and assistance by the experts of the Department is avail-
able in any branch of agricultural industry.
IRRIGABLE FARMS.
Large areas have been acquired in the Irrigation Districts of the State,
and are made available for application from time to time. These lands are
more or less improved, are of good quality, respond freely to cultiva-
tion, and provide an immediate return for the capital and labor expended.
The allotments will be sold under Closer Settlement conditions.
THE SUGAR BEET INDUSTRY.—Areas for the growth of sugar beet
have been acquired in the district surrounding MafEra, and have been sub-
divided into Farms in conjunction with the growth of sugar beet. The State
Sugar Factory at Maffra will be able to utilise the whole of the Sugar Beet
grown. There is every promise of a highly remunerative return to the indus-
trious grower. The Government gives great inducements to growers to com-
mence the growth of the beet.

VICTORIA
is the second smallest State in the Com-

VICTORIA
has resumed over 408,500 acres of valu-
able land for settlement as farm and
other allotments under the Closer Settle-
ment Acts.
VICTORIA
is the land of rapid growth and un-
limited possibilities. Good Soil, splendid
climate, ample rainfall, free education,
light taxation, and general prosperity.
VICTORIA’S
climate is the most suited of any in
Australia to the constitution of the

IN VICTORIA
all crops which may be grown in Eng-
land flourish. Fruits of all kinds at-
tain perfection. In the northern districts
are to be found thousands of acres of
orange and lemon groves, and vineyards
of currants, raisins, sultana, wine and
table grapes.
VICTORIA
has the most liberal land laws of the
world. Advances are made on easy
terms to aid settlers in the erection of
the necessary improvements. It grants
loans of passage money and also cheap
passages to settlers from abroad. Gen-
erous railway concessions are granted.

How to Address Letters.
Correspondents to The Bulletin would oblige the
paper (and, to an extent, themselves ) by taking
some care as to methods of address.
Business letters (with regard to subscriptions, ad-
vertisements, etc.) should in no case be addressed to
the Editor, but to the Manager. To send them to
the Editor is to invite inattention.
It is not a good thing to address editorial letters
to anyone by name. “The Editor, The Bulletin,” is
the proper superscription for “copy.” Delay, and
even loss, is sometimes caused by addressing to per-
sons instead of officials. The person may not be
there; the official alirays is.

DEAR FOOD.
The year 1911 is likely to be long remem-
bered as the year of the Dear Food dis-
turbances. They broke out in one shape or
another in almost every country which has
to depend largely on imported victuals, and
in two or three places—notably in Britain —
they broke out on a very large scale. The
Briton is, as a rule, a law-abiding person;
he didn’t, for instance, hit a Judge on the
head with an axe and drown a principal
policeman, as did a mob of Spanish furies
at Cullera; therefore his uprising attracted
less attention than might have been expected
considering the numbers engaged. In some
cases the people rose because food was so
high that it wasn’t commensurate with the
wages, and in other instances they burst into
insurrection because the pay was so low that
it was out of all reasonable proportion to
the food. Sometimes, as in France, they
wanted more bread and meat for the shil-
ling ; sometimes, as in the United Kingdom,
they demanded more shilling with which to
buy bread and meat. The trouble was ex-
pressed in different ways, but in every case
it was based on the discrepancy between the
provender and the remuneration, and the
difficulty of buying sufficient sustenance out
of the honorarium. The same trouble has
been with the human race, more or less, to its
own certain knowledge, for some hundreds
of years, and probably for thousands of
years. Those who go out in search of the
old dismasted facts that drift on the sea of
history find, for instance, that John Bull,
in the year 1201, or thereabouts, got good
fresh beef for |d. per lb. About 1350 the
flesh of the ox was Ad. About 1450 it sold
at 81b. for sd. It was id. a lb. about 1560.
A century later it was 3d.; in another cen-
tury it reached 4|d.; and then it flew right
up out of sight till the importation of chilled
and frozen meat pulled it down again for a
while, and in a small way. A certain list of
necessaries, ranging from a whole ox down to
a gallon of beer, cost J. Bull 18s. Id. about
the year 1250; then, taking leaps of
a century at a time (if it is safe to
leap a hundred years with an ox and
a gallon of beer), the price of the same
collection of goods rose to £2 13s. 3d.;
£4 ISs. 5d.; £9 4s. 2d.* £2l 16s. 2d.;
£3B 15s. lid. (about 1750), and finally,
about the year 1885, the articles couldn’t be
bought for less than £62 11s. And to-day
they are much higher than that. Prices have
always been rising. Moreover, they usually
rise first, and wages come lagging after.
There are exceptions to this rule, but not
many.
* * v ■ * *
Of late, a new element of scarcity has
entered into the question of food prices.
There was a time when famine (accom-
panied by famine prices) was caused by
lack of roads, railways, ships and the like,
so that one nation might be perishing through
failure of its crops, while the one next door
had a useless and unsaleable surplus, and
hardly even knew that its neighbor was
partly dead. There was also a time when war
was waged on tue simple principle of burning
every combustible object that couldn’t be
conveniently stolen, and hanging the owner
of the combustible object if he failed to make
an early start for the horizon. That also
caused grievous shortages and high charges.
These troubles have at least been alleviated,
but now a fresh cause of anxiety is dimly
visioned on the horizon. For the first time
in all history man begins to contemplate afar
off the Universal Shortage, and to wonder if
the unusual rise in prices, of late years, is the
shadow that Universal Shortage casts ahead
of it. The demand for food has increased at
a stupendous rate, in recent times, for the
simple reason that population is growing as
it never grew before —in fact, during the last
century or so, it has apparently been growing
10 or 20 times faster than it ever grew be-
fore. England and Wales, for instance, in-
creased their population from 8,000,000
people—that was all they had contrived to
acquire between Creation and the year 1801
—to 32,000,000 in 1901. The United States
boomed in a century from 5,000,000 to
90,000,000. Prussia jumped in the same time
from 8,000,000 to 40,000,000. There is no
corresponding increase in the possible food-
growing area, for no new continents are
made or discovered ln fact, the
possible food area is diminishing as the de-
mand increases, for man wants more and
more soil on which to grow timber for build-
ing houses and ships, for fuel and for furni-
ture making; he wants more ground to live
upon; and he wants quite a vast area to
produce rubber for the tyres of his motor-car.
The United Kingdom was the first country
to definitely reach the point at which it had
to depend on imported food supplies. It
wandered back and forward for years across
the line at which self-support ended and
foreign dependence commenced, but at last
—within the memory of people still living—
it definitely crossed the border. The Free-
trade madness helped to shove it across. It
is difficult to get full details re its early
sources of supply, for records were loosely
kept, but by the year 1894 Holland, Bel-
gium, France, Spain, Portugal, Italy and
Austria had all ceased to furnish Britain
with wheat; in other words, they had ceased
to have a surplus, and most of them were
themselves hustling for outside food. In
1898 the British Isles imported about
65,000,000 cwt. of wheat and 21,017,109 cwt.
of flour, principally as follows
Wheat (cwt.). Wheat (cwt.).
U. States ..37,804,300 Chile .. 807,300
India .. 9,537,900 Germany ..711,390
Russia .. 6,232,500 Turkey ..271,560
Canada .. 5,012,030 Australasia ..211,620
Argentina .. 4,034,700 Roumania ..183,700
Also, 21,017,109 cwt. flour, of which 17,445,890
cwt. came from the United States.
In those days Eastern Russia hadn’t come
into the field as a very great wheat furnisher,
and Western Russia was 'beginning to eat up
its own wheat so fast that, as shown above,
it only supplied Britain with 6,000,000 cwt.,
where four years earlier it had supplied over
16.000,000 cwt. Thjhgs grew worse with it,
and in 1899 it had almost dropped out of the
list of suppliers. ‘ But later a change set in
with the development of new lands in East-
ern Russia, Siberia, and the Caucasus. Five
years later, in 1903, John Bull found that
he required over 88,000,OOOcwt. of wheat
and 20,601,191 cwt. of flour to keep him
going, and he got the goods mostly in this
fashion :
Wheat (cwt.). Wheat (cwt.).
U. States ..24,195,726 Roumania ..3,140,727
Russia ..17,176,302 Turkey .. 459,104
India ..17,057,842 Germany .. 310,175
Argentina .14,120,455 Australasia .. 230
Canada ..10,803,941 Chile, etc. .. 866,132
Also, 20,601,191 cwt. of flour, of which the U.S.
supplied 16,223,384 cwt.
That was the last time Germany had any
surplus wheat to sell. It handed in its
resignation and became one of the importers,
and made one more competitor in the market.
The most notable feature is that the main
sources of supply begin to be shoved further
out, remote places like Eastern Russia, In-
dia and Argentina, all coming notably to the
front.
In the year 1907 Turkey followed the ex-
ample of Germany and gave up its billet as a
wheat exporter. That left Russia (which is
partly Asiatic), and Roumania as the only
European countries with breadstuffs to sell.
Roumania presently began to have less and
less surplus. The United States kept on the
down grade. Canada made its biggest effort
(16,615,746 cwt.) in 1909, and then dropped
a little. Chile reached the top (2,210,700 cwt.)
in 1908, and then showed signs of becoming
a back number. In 1910 J. Bull found
himself clamoring for no less than
108,000,OOOcwt. of wheat and 9,960,491 cwt.
of flour, and he got it principally thus: —
Wheat (cwt.). Wheat (cwt.).
Russia ..28,941,600 Australasia .13,117,500
India ..17,916,738 U. States ..10,948,900
Canada ..16,449,200 Roumania .. 939,200
Argentina ..15,131,800 Chile .. 630,500
Also, 9,960,491 cwt. of flour, of which the U.S.
furnished 5,117,380 cwt.
That shows all Western and Central Europe,
also Turkey in the east, dried up as a
source of supply and turned into a wheat
importing region. It shows little Roumania
drying up, and the United States getting
very near the point at which it will have no
spare wheat to sell, and getting there very
suddenly. Comparing 1898 with 1910, it is
evident that Britain wants much more
wheat than it did 12 years earlier, and has
to reach much further out to get it, and Bri-
tain is only a sample—though the worst
sample—of the general tendency of Western
and Central Europe. Twelve years isn’t a
wonderfully long time in which to effect
such a change. _ To make up for the failure of
the old granaries, Siberia, Argentina, Cana-
da and Australasia, which, a very few years
ago, were practically countries in reserve,
have been called upon very earnestly to make
up the deficit. All tnis suggests movement —-
quite a lot of movement.
Of course, there are still vast unexplored
possibilities _in these new countries —such
great possibilities that it may be a quarter
or half a century, even at the present rate of
progress, before the human race will be
really “up against it.” And there are still
unexploited regions in Asia, Africa and
South America. But in considering the
Dear Food problem there are several points
to be kept in view:—
(1) The old countries, which began any time be-
tween 72 years ago and yesterday, to be unable to
supply themselves with food and to be buyers of ex-
traneous victuals, want more extraneous victuals
every year, as their population increases.
(2) The buyers become constantly more numerous
as one country after another gets off the list of
sellers and on to that of buyers. When the United
States does this conversion act, which will probably
be within the next 10 years, it is liable to shake up
the food market of the world. And Canada, Argen-
tina and India will follow.
(3) As the buyers increase the sellers naturally
decrease.
(4) Also, the sellers want more and more of their
crop for their own consumption.
(5) There will soon be a stupendous necessity for
planting new forests, for the timber scarcity is far
nearer than the food scarcity. And as man invents
new wants he requires more ground to supply them.
He wants not only more wool and cotton and silk,
which all require space, but he already requires a
decent-sized kingdom to grow rubber to make tyres
for his motor-car.
Taking all the circumstances into account it
looks not only as if the price of food is
bound to increase—it always, apparently,
has been doing that—but that it is bound to
increase much faster than heretofore.
* * * *
There ought to be a good time in view for
the agriculturist, provided he doesn’t get
swelled head and take too violent an ad-
vantage of his position. He has long been
one of the worst-paid individuals in the com-
munity, but this position should be reversed
in a few generations, and he should take his
place in the front rank of the affluent. The
Man with the Hoe has waited a great while
for his opportunity, and it appears to be
coming. And there should be a good time
ahead for the comparatively thinly-peopled
countries provided they can hold their own.
If they can’t hold their own there is pro-
bably ahead of them the worst time they
ever had. On the other hand, the prospect
for the very thickly-peopled countries seems
none too pleasant. As the demand for wheat
grows greater the wheat-selling countries
will realise their power. They will pro-
bably begin to regulate the trade by export
duties or otherwise. They will feed them-
selves first, and the thickly-peopled countries
will get what is left, which is another way
of saying that prices will be put up like the
very devil. The thickly-peopled countries
will use bad language—naturally. They
may even use worse things. There will again
be Dear Food disturbances, but instead of a
few people going out to break a baker’s win-
dow a great many people will very likely go
out to break the windows of a continent.
There will be a new incentive to war and
conquest, for a oartly unoccupied country
with a great grain surplus, or possibilities of
a great grain surplus, promises to be of much
more value 50 years or even 25 years hence
than it is to-day. There are already plenty
of incentives to war and conquest, and Dear
Food will add another to the list. There-
fore, it will be the business of the partly
unoccupied country to see that it isn’t too
unoccupied, for thieves will multiply and the
Face at the Window will grow more trucu-
lent of aspect. When a very small race
owns a very rich gold or diamond deposit
there is more wealth to go round than if the
community was larger, but if this is carried
too far a larger people annexes the whole
show, and the small race has no wealth at
all to go round. It may even be fortunate
if it is allowed to go round itself doing odd
jobs for its new masters, instead of meeting
a worse fate. The best prospect, some few
generations hence, should be for the empire
which has a thickly-peopled nucleus and a
large, fertile and thinly-inhabited tail, pro-
vided it can hold together, and the nucleus
can persuade or force the tail to give it
special advantages in the way of food supply
-—to give preference in the matter of ex-
ports rather than in that of imports. Of
course the tail may decline to sacrifice the
profits it would gain by dealing in the
world’s markets, and may give back-talk to
the nucleus, and then that empire will pro-
bably go to pieces. Or the tail may insist,
as the price of its aid and support, that it be
made the head and political centre of the
empire, and the old nucleus may find itself
degraded to the status of a province, and
pensioned off with a bread allowance.
There are many interesting features about
the Dear Food problem. One of the most
interesting is its velocity. Seventy-two
years ago every country in Europe—the most
thickly-peopled section of the earth —could
grow its own loaf peacefully at its own door,
and in the main every country did so. There
were exceptions, but only exceptions. This
state of things had lasted, so far as men
know, for all time. Now, Europe has to
rake the farthest ends of the earth for its
loaf, and to rake harder every year. If it
doesn’t get that loaf —if the supplier gives
notice that he will want the goods in future
for his own use —then the sceptre of some,
at least, among the gyand old nations will
depart, and the glory , will fade. Where the
immediate interest comes in is that the
one-time biggest supplier— that is to say,
the United States —has. practically given
that notice, not only in the matter of bread-
stuffs, but also as regards meat and other
sundries. And already the harried people of
Western Europe feel the pinch badly and
have aimed a rock at ’the baker’s windqw—
not the soft “gibber” that turneth away
wrath, but the hard variety.
PLAIN ENGLISH.
The Little Steamers that Get Lost.
There are two' ways of , running a coastal
trade—the way N.S.W* ddes it and the other
way. This profound reflection is inspired
by the awful mortality which has prevailed
in recent times among the little long-shore
craft of the Ma State. One device—which
is not the one Ma adopts, but the other one
—is to furbish up the few good ports which
the coast-line can show, to supply them all
with wharves and other essentials, to con-
nect each one by railway with the district
which Nature intended it to serve, and to give
these railways every facility to bring big
loads of goods for export down to the big
cities that would grow up beside these big
ports, so that the goods could there be shoved
directly on board the big ships. These big
ships would then strike right out into the
big deep ocean. That would mean that rail-
ways would do the work at present
done by the small, wretched bar harbors, and
that the tiny, luckless, feckless craft which
now hug the coast and decorate it with their
bones would go out of the business. The
other device is to leave the big neglected
ports unused as at present. (A deep water
port, it may be observed, with no bar at the
entrance, is always a port with high land
around it, no big river running into it,
and no rich river flats to attract
settlers; so, while towns spring up volun-
tarily on the bad harbors, the good ones need
railway communication to bring business.)
That means maintaining a fleet of poor little
craft to potter in and out of the dreadful,
bar-bound river-mouths, and bring goods
down to Sydney, either for export, because
Sydney is the only place where the big ships
come, or for local consumption, because Syd-
ney, under the present system, is the only
big local market. What some of these har-
bors are like can be gathered from this list
of low-water measurements at the various
entrances (N.S.VV. Statistical Register for
1909. page 76) :

These lamentable river mouths have ab-
sorbed an immensity of money, which is mostly
dead loss, for their latnentableness remains
much the same. They are only approach-
able by small vessels, and even the small
vessels often perish on the bars. When they
don’t perish on the bars, they often perish
outside. They can’t stand the weather if
they go far out, and they are apt to bump
on rocks if they keep close in. They have to
keep close in, partly because they don’t
like the weather far out, and partly to save
time, because they Lave to call at so many
of the lamentable, stormy river mouths where
there is about a yard of water at
low tide. The business costs a ter-
rible lot of lives. If the deep-water
harbors that at present lie useless
were made available for first-class ships, and
goods were fetched there by rail, then eight
out of the 13 alleged ports in the above list
would probably be written off as bad debts,
and the towns situated upon them would be-
come railway centres instead of centres for a
twopenny steamboat service. That would
save a lot of money, for railways pay inte-
rest on their cost, and shallow bar harbors
don’t pay for the grease used on the dredge.
It would also save lives, for trains don’t
make complete disappearances, like weary
little steamers. But, alas! the use of the
good harbors outside of Sydney is prevented
lest they should interfere with the foreign-
trade monopoly of the big city. So the pro-
duce has to come to Sydney by sea from the
little harbors, partly through lack of coastal
railways, and partly because pigs and vege-
tables can’t stand the cost of 200 or 300 or
400 miles of railway freight. And there
have to be little steamers to go into the little
harbors. It may be that the man who first
thought of sending, all the stormy way to
Nambucca, a vessel small enough to crawl
over the Nambucca bar ought to have been
hanged. It may be that the people who con-
tinue sending that sort of vessel there ought
to be hanged. These are theological points
which should be referred to a committee of
two bishops and a rope-maker.

Exodus, also called The Second Book of
Moses.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
I am troubled by a Vision
Which besets me in the night,
And no Bulletin derision
Can dispel it or affright;
For, incessantly unsleeping,
On a prickly bed I sprawl,
With the terrors on me creeping
Of the Flight of Capital.
In the Second Book of Moses
You may read of shuddrous things:
But no horror that it shows is
Like an Exodus on wings!
What a spell of windy weather!
What a darkness overhead!
What a rain of fluffy feather
When the pinions have been spread !
I am stricken with aphasia—
In a fit the bed I bite —
As the Bank of Australasia
Pops away in sudden flight!
And it passes my endurance,
Leaves me helpless, cold and null,
When I see my life insurance
Flitting seaward like a gull.
In the hour before the sunrise,
I, with ice around my heart,
See a million-acre run rise,
Wag its tail, and so depart.
Bullocks flutter off, as only
Scared Australian bullocks can:
Do you doubt my visions lonely?
Nay, then ask your Abo-man.
Re is truthful; and, as he knows,
We have seen, with faces pale,
Forty thousand pure merinos
Soaring down along the gale;
Then we’ve heard the Herald crying.
Truculent amid our woe,
“Look how Capital is Flying!
Ain’t I always told yer sot”
Dreams, that yield to no dispelling!
Nightmares, squatting on my bed!
Yet the worst remains for telling
In this avalanche of dread.
From my trouser-pocket hollow—
Far too void for men to rob—
With the swiftness of a swallow
Darts my last and only bob !
That is why your head-lines solemn
Have not brought me solace yet;
That is why your Wild Cat column
Cannot stop my pallid sweat:
There’s a doom that I must dree, and
On my head the Curse must fall:
I have seen what none can see, and
Live—the Flight of Capital.
VICTORIA.

IN THE LAND OF THE
UNSPEAKABLE
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
LET us sit down together, brethren, and
consider that odd corner of the land
of the Unspeakable Turk, which is
comprised in Palestine and the adjacent land
of Syria, and great is the unspeakableness
thereof. As a blight the Turk is possibly
rivalled by the Persian and the Moor, but
on this point there is no assured evidence.
Some authorities declare that there is no
one like him except himself and the Devil;
and: that, in the matters of energy, punc-
tuality and business capacity, he isn’t a
patch on the Devil,
There are roads in Palestine here and
there, and there are railways here and
there. The old Romans were hefty road-
makers, and even after centuries of neglect
it is a blessed circumstance in places to
strike a fragment of the ancient Italian
highway, and do some good travelling. The
Crusaders did a little work of the same sort,
but not, much. They were a valiant lot of
crustaceans, but no engineers. Then the
French rushed an army into the country
some 60 years ago, and did many things.
That was soon after the Crimean War, at
which period the Unspeakable, in his deep
gratitude for the British, French and Italian
aid which had dragged him out of a hole, pro-
mised to reform, and live cleanly, and take
his front feet out of the trough. Then he
started a general butchery of the Christian
population of Syria, and the infuriated
Gauls came armed to ask what he meant by
it. These invaders were road-makers of
great tonnage. They constructed the first
highway from the coast to Jerusalem, and
the first highway from the coast to Damascus.
That city, the second or third in the great
Turkish Empire, was formerly reached by a
sort of goat or ant track. Commerce was
carried on camels, horses and mules, and a
tribfe of robbers, located half-way, generally
took half the goods. If the traveller had no
goods they usually tried him for being with-
out visible means of support, and cut his
throat. The earmark of the liar of Lebanon
in olden times was his boast that he had
ridden alone from Beirut to Damascus.
When he said that a great silence fell on
the public-house, and presently, one by one,
the audience rose and left. The Turk never
interfered with the robbers, and they throve
for centuries, and handed down their job
from bleeding sire to son, as Byron has it.
Then French workmen started to build a
splendid highway over the mountains, and
shot the Arabs who ordered them to leave
oh. Next the strangers put caravans of
waggons on the road, and carried goods far
below the old rate, and their drivers shot
the Arabs who canae to demand half the pro-
perty. Likewise they established a coach
service, and the escort shot the Arabs who
waylaid the vehicles and demanded the
travellers’ valuables. Next a railway was
built, and when the remnant of the same old
tribe started train-wrecking, the Frenchmen
gave way to unreasoning anger, and shot so
promiscuously that the last of the robbers
fled the country in dismay.
All the railways in Syria are French ex-
cept one, which will be described later on.
The Turk has built one road himself and
is making another. Fate has driven him to
it. The allegedly Holy Land lives mostly
on the pious swindle—in fact, if it were not
for the pious swindle and a certain amount
of belated agriculture, the place would have
to be abandoned. And the pious swindle
lives on the foreigner. The hardy old pil-
grim of other days, whose faith was strong
and his feet tough, took things as they came.
He was generally a male. He arrived from
countries where the tracks were none too
good, and he was accustomed to hard travel-
ling and hard living. So he hoofed and
camelled and donkeyed through the land,
making small complaint; and reflected that
the worse his corns were on the path to
Jerusalem the easier they would be on the
narrow way to Paradise. And the owner of
the land said “Bismallah,” or words to that
effect, and let things slide.
Theh in later years came a new type —the
tourist or pilgrim-tourist. Pie was often a
female, and sometimes American at that.
He was accustomed to easy travelling. He
had much money to spend, and promised to
be a great asset if he wasn’t scared away.
Hotels, more or less comfortable, were built
for his accommodation, and European hotel-
keepers began to multiply, for the Unspeak-
able doesn’t keep hotel —he doesn’t know
how. Lager beer, whisky and cognac arose
in the land. Plug tobacco and cigarettes ap-
peared on the horizon. There was born a
demand for new things, and the dazed Otto-
man, feeling that the foundations of the
earth were giving way beneath his feet, had
to sit up and take notice in his own obscure
way.
Unfortunately, though he built one road
and badly muddled another, he has not yet
learned that roads require repair. His great
and notable effort leads from Jerusalem to
Jericho, the Jordan and the Dead Sea.
Seemingly it was a good work once, though
some of the grades are terrible. Now it is
a variable quantity. It has had every pos-
sible chance, for the wheeled traffic consists
solely of light vehicles carrying tourists; the
rest of the scanty trade is mere camel and
donkey wanderings, and the passage of the
local pedestrian, stepping lightly in his
skirts and flat shoes, or on his bare horny
feet. There is little rain to destroy the sur-
face, hardly a tree to fall across it, and
illimitable limestone for repairing purposes.
Yet most of the mountain section is just
Sheol and the level section is mostly a ribbon
of dust and rocks stretching across a plain
of rocks and dust. There is not one main-
tenance man on the whole route; it is
alleged that there never was one; it seems
probable that there never will be one. The
Uispeakable, viewed on the evidence, doesn’t
know a maintenance man from a blue giraffe
with red stripes and a burning torch on its
head. . *
So the summer visitor to Jericho rises at
3 a.m., and has a snack beneath the stars,
and flees early towards the glory of Solomon
in a sort of four-wheeled cab with three
horses —the wise horse in the middle, the
foolish horse on the right, and the dissipated
horse on the left. He does this because the
animals would probably faint by. the wayside
unless they had a chance to get into the cool
mountain air before the heat and burden of
the day, and journeying is slow. Even under
the most favorable circumstances the de-
fendant walks over the most perpendiculai
section of the way. It is a wonderful sight
to see the three steeds clawing up the wall
of the Ottoman road with the carriage dang-
ling behind and all the luggage nouring out
at the back, and into Moab. *
The local peasant farmer is to be met fre-
quently on these roads, hunting his crop to
market on the back of a donkey or hunting
the empty donkey home again from market.
He is a simple and interesting agriculturist.
In the mountain country of Judah he some-
times fences in his bit of land with hunks ot
the loose and abundant limestone, to keep
the hyena out of the crop, while at other
times he leaves it unfenced. But then there
is hardly any cultivation in the mountain
country. On the plains he usually fences
with thorns, or else, again, he doesn t fence
at all. He ploughs up the soil with a quaint
and hunchbacked old circumstance, which
suggests a plank with a hairpin at the end
of it. There are said to be exceptions to this
rule, but I saw none of them. He sows the
seed by hand, and harrows with something
that looks like the plough’s small brother.
When the crop is ripe he hews it down by
hand, and deposits it in heaps on the ground.
And then comes the great operation ot
threshing, which consists, as a rule, in har-
nessing two or three cattle together, and
driving them to and fro over the piled-up
produce from early dawn to dark. Why the
wretched animals do not fall down from
sheer giddiness is a mystery. But they go
round and round and round with infinite
patience, and the man on the land bolts con-
tinuously after them with shouts of encour-
agement, and at long last the work is done,
or half done —at least it is done as well as
the circumstances allow. It is all as it was
in the days of the late Moses, when the
Hebrew was forbidden to muzzle the. ox as
he stamped on the wheat. The ox is still
unmuzzled, but he doesn’t appear to eat the
wheat. Perhaps he is too dizzy. Perhaps
the frenzied being who runs after him all
day has taught him better. Possibly he is
so sick of his job that he hates the very men-
tion of wheat, and can’t even endure to read
the grain market quotations. Or, maybe, he
is more particular than his master, and re-
fuses to eat trodden-on food.
THE
LUGGAGE
FALLING INTO
MOAB.
Even in immovable old Palestine, how-
ever, the ox isn’t an invariable institution.
Sometimes a horse drags a stone over the
grain at the end of a rope. Sometimes a
donkey drags a plank. Or, again, by way of
reckless innovation, the horse may drag the
plank and the donkey the stone.
Winnowing is a simple business. Some
time, when there is a gentle breeze, the Pal-
estine farmer throws his crop up into the air
with a shovel. He stands to leeward, so
that it won’t fall into his eye. The height to
which he throws it depends on the strength
of the breeze. The grain comes down in a
fairly perpendicular fashion. The chaff
blows a few yards away. When the whole
output of the farm has been shot upwards at
the stars some three or four times, the owner
inspects the result with the naked eye, and
paws it over by hand. If he is satisfied, the
matter ends there; if he isn’t satisfied he
throws up the great nature! resources of the
country once more. Then he bags the finished
result, puts six bags of it on three small
donkeys, to the almost total obliteration of
the donkeys, and runs behind with encourag-
ing shouts for 18 or 24 or 36 miles to market.
And when he has sold the corn it is ground
by hand (grinding corn is a simple but mono-
tonous occupation for the blind, who are a
strangely numerous race in the land of the
Unspeakable), and made by hand into a
large, thin, flapjack sort of thing, and the in-
tending customer overhauls the pile by hand
till he finds a flapjack which commends itself
to him. Meanwhile the farmer, as already
mentioned, either chases his three discharged
donkeys home in ballast, or else he rides one
donkey and chases two.
There are good and sufficient reasons why
the farmer of Palestine adheres to his old
methods of conveyance. He has hardly hea rd
of a wheeled vehicle, except the one the
tourist rides in. There isn’t even a visible
wheelbarrow in the whole of old Canaan. It
would be folly to buy a vehicle if he had the
money and the knowledge, for a donkey can
go almost anywhere, and there is a sort of
spongy adhesiveness about a camel which
almos't qualifies that beast for climbing a
tree or walking on the ceiling. On the other
hand, a cart can only go to the few places
which are accessible by road. Moreover, any
great increase of wheeled traffic would be
bad for the neglected roads; in fact it might
obliterate them altogether, and then the
donkey, instead of having some kind of high-
way in places, would have to cling with its
teeth to the mountain side everywhere, and
let itself down absurd precipices by the tail.
When that result came about the farmer
would have to break up his cart for fire-
wood. And before half the cart was burned
the Unspeakable would probably come along
and arrest him for spoiling the road, and
give him six months in a gaol that would
make even a dog angry.
* * * *
The small agriculturist of Palestine —es-
pecially in the south, where much of the land
is poor and where there are fewer beneficent
remnants of the French occupation than in
the north —is not a rich man. Where 25
people do by hand the work that one might
do by machinery, wealth is naturally a scarce
object. The average bucolic person of
Judsea has no piano, no gramophone, no pic-
tures or oleographs, no glass windows, no
books, newspapers, theatres, cinemato-
graph shows, lectures, chimney, clock, watch,
or prospects, and he has no furniture worth
mentioning. If he is of the better class, his
residence is a square, flat-headed stone build-
ing of one or two rooms, fitted inwardly with
an earthern floor, some cooking utensils, and
sundry articles of clothing, but he may hang
out in a brushwood-and-cloth hovel or a tent.
His position is uncertain; his education (in
the ordinary acceptation of the term) is
almost nil. Yet, so far as it is possible to
judge on a very brief acquaintance, this
neglected individual should be the hope of
the community. He is generally straight
and sinewy, with a pleasant face, white
teeth, and good brown legs, which traverse
the alleged roads of the Unspeakable at a
very respectable rate. He seems, on the
whole, a hospitable and agreeable person. I
met two of him busy watching about four
sheep amid the ruins of the great temple of
Samaria, and the kindly insistence with
which this party made me drink coffee out
of a shovel left a deep impression on my
mind. When the Turk is quite dead, and is
deeply buried, and his remains have been
squashed by a 100-ton monument, with an
inscription on it setting forth that for him
there will be no resurrection, there should be
a future before the Arab of Palestine —not
the Bedouin Arab, who is supposed to be the
old lost Hebrew tribe of Simeon gone to the
dogs, but the more peaceful specimen of the
race. At present, however, he is so back-
ward that he hardly knows he is backward.
In other words, he hardly knows that any-
body else is forward or that there is any such
place as forward.
Yet this man lives in a land which, despite
patches of barrenness, has great possibilities.
It is almost a treeless country now, by
reason of the waste and folly of many cen-
turies ; but it was well-timbered once, and it
might be so again if the Unspeakable, wan-
dering around in the fez that is imported
from Austria, had any more idea of afforesta-
tion than he has of whale-fishery. The
wretchedly bare and untenanted hills of
Judaea and the nude mountains of Moab
might be transformed into a waving mass of
tree-tops, and there is no obvious reason why
the almost dead and gone cedar should not
be planted again on Lebanon. There are
regular winter rains, and there might be the
“latter rains,” as there were in days of old,
if the arboreal hair were restored to the
nude, white, glistening scalps of the ranges.
Almost anything would be possible with a
Government that knew enough to plant
trees, make roads and railways, supply edu-
cation, encourage industry, and hang its cor-
rupt officials. Irrigation exists only in one
or two spots, and on a very small scale, yet
the chances are enormous. In that respect
the valley of the Jordan is probably one of
the best propositions in the world. It is
wider than most of the Nile valley, yet the
Nile valley is the whole wealth of F>vpt. It
is flat, exceedingly rich, it lies mosiiv below
sea-level, it is shut in by abrupt hills, and it
is furnished with a fairly large, swift and
never-failing river. Once this region was a
land of plenty and densely peopled. But the
curse of the Unspeakable came upon it, and
the irrigation works fell to pieces, and the
cultivators fled or died, and the towns per-
ished, and even the grass gave up the ghost
when it saw the evil, bloated circumstance
of tlie oppressor’s hat on the skyline. Now-
adays the Jordan runs to waste, like practi-
cally every other river in an aged and moul-
dering land.
* * * *
The average village of Palestine consists
of square stone cottages, glaring white or
light grey outside, and murky and unfur-
nished within ; older stone cottages that have
fallen into ruins; traces of very old cottages
which have been practically obliterated:
debris and dustheaps. The alleged streets
are hardly ever wide enough to admit a
vehicle, and even when they are, there is so
little spare space that the passengers fre-
quently get out and lift the back wheels
round corners. Also, the streets are all holes
and hills, and are sometimes at such an
angle that a dog slides across them one way
and waits for a favoring wind to help him
back. There is no port at Jaffa because the
Unspeakable doesn’t make ports ; ships sim-
ply anchor in the Mediterranean. There is
no r eal port. anywhere save what Nature or
the French invaders constructed.
There is no road by which a carriage can
traverse the holy city of Jerusalem. Cabs
come in a _fe,w yards and bring up at the
hotels, but if they went further they would
rush down stairs, or get bogged in narrow
bazaars that are roofed in and full of shops
adorned with all manner of tawdry glories ;
also, the horse would slide on old Roman
grease, and fall down and break his neck;
and the stench would clothe the passenger
with a garment of cursing; and the driver
would get into trouble for running over Ibra-
him, the cripple, in the middle of the street.
The Turk doesn’t propose to make a carriage
road through Jerusalem. Perhaps it is as
well. It might be wiser to destroy Jerusa- ‘‘
lem, to put dynamite under it and blow up
all its hills, and fill the Valley of Jehosa-
phat and the Vale of Hinnom with the ruins
—in short, to wipe out the place so utterly
that it would be unrecognisable for ever-
more. Or else, it might be put into the
hands of some strenuous Power which would
gaol nine-tenths of its priests for getting
money by false pretences, taking a mean ad-
vantage of the Aveak-minded, robbing fools,
and driving pious cranks to plain insanity.
And it wouldn’t be amiss to disinfect part of
the other tenth.
Jerusalem is the world’s great confidence
trick. It is a place with stately ramparts
outside and donkeys and slush and hypocrisy
within. Every possible item of Scripture his-
tory has been scraped together there or there-
abouts, and the alleged site is always on view
for a consideration. Inside the great boss
fraud —the Church of the Holy Sepulchre-
are shown, among other things: (1) The ex-
act centre of the earth; (2) the exact spot
where Adam was created; (3) the place
where he was buried (he was evidently ani
untravelled man) ; (4) the pillar to which*'
Jesus Christ was bound; (5) the cell in
which He was temporarily confined (though
the church was admittedly built by the Cru-
saders many centuries after His death; (6)
the scene of the crucifixion; (7) the three
holes in which the three crosses were placed ;
(8) the spot where Jesus and Mary stood
immediately before the crucifixion: (9) the
really authentic spot where Christ’s raiment
was parted; (10) the spot where the women
stood while the body was laid in the tomb :
(11) the tomb of Christ; (12) the places
where the angels sat after the resurrection ;
(13) the tomb of Nicodemus; (14) the tomb
of Joseph of Arimathea. These are a good
many items to crowd into one church, yet
they are not all. In addition, there is the
exact spot where Longinus, the _ Roman
soldier who pierced the side of Christ upon
the cross, did penance for his sin. He had
been a one-eyed man, but some of the. sacred
blood dropped on his blind eye, and his sight
being restored he was naturally converted.
At the same time, some of the blood fell
through a hole in the earth on to the skull
of Adam, and that Oldest Father of the
human race instantly rose from the dead,
though his after proceedings are enshrouded
in mystery. It may be that he went on the
land. Also, in the same crowded tabernacle
are exhibited the footprint of the Lord; the
stocks in which His feet were confined ; the
place where He was scoffed at by the ribald
multitude; the place where He appeared
after the resurrection ; the place where Abra-
ham found the ram; and many other inter-
esting sites and details.
There is something marvellous _ about all
this accurate dennition when it is remem-
bered that Jerusalem has been twice wiped
off the map since the day of the Crucifixion;
that it was for 60 years a practically unin-
habited pile of ruins; and that after this
long abandonment it was rebuilt by pagan
folk who neither knew nor cared for the
sacred sites.
Despite the monstrous grab done by the
Church of the Holy Sepulchre, there are
plenty of show places left. The room of the
Last Supper is revealed; it is a large up-
stairs apartment, supported by pillars, of
fairly recent appearance, and frankly ad-
mitted to be only about 400 years old. Then
there are the tomb of David, the House ot
Caiaphas, the stone on which the disciples
sat while the Lord washed their feet, the
rock on which Abraham proposed to offer up
Isaac, the gate through which Adonijah fled
when Solomon was crowned, the gate through
which Stephen was taken to be stoned, the
gate through which tne Lord passed on His
way to Calvary, the identical stone on which
the rooster stood when it crowed at St. Peter
(the bird itself, strangely enough, is not
shown), and the place where Peter stood
when the fowl of evil omen lifted its voice in
reproach. A coarse and fearsome picture
expounds the Redeemer, Peter and the
rooster all standing on one square yard of
space. Furthermore, there are on exhibition
the apartment wherein Jeremiah wrote his
prophecies, and the tombs of the Virgin Mary,
of her parents, of Joseph of Nazareth, Abso-
lem, Jehoshaphat, Zacharias, St. James, the
Hebrew prophets, the Hebrew kings, the
Hebrew judges—in fact, the burial place of
almost everybody except Goliath and the
Devil.
* * * *
And all these, though they may seem to
constitute a fairly large order, are only the
crude beginnings of the trouble. In and
close around Jerusalem are shown, for suffi-
cient and reasonable monetary consideration,
part of the house of Pontius Pilate, the road
to Cavalry, with the different places at which
the Cross was put down for a rest (there
are about 14 of them, and the numbers are
printed large on the wall), the other tomb
of Christ (admission 4|d.), the place where
Pilate washed his hands, the old armchair
of St. James, the spot where St. James was
beheaded (the Turkish Government, how-
ever bad it may be on roads, has a wonder-
ful capacity for keeping spots in good re-
pair), the house of Annas, the quarries off
Solomon, the stables of Solomon, the pool
of Solomon, the pool of Hezekiah (apparently
no Hebrew king was complete without a
pool), the garden of Solomon, the garden of
Jehoshaphat (no Hebrew king was quite
complete and finished without a garden), the
place where Judas Panged himself, and the
bit of land which was bought with the
money returned by Judas just before he
suspended payment. Judas isn’t still hang-


ing; presumably his remains were cut down
by parties who are still at large. And the
visitor can also see, on very moderate terms,
the spot where the Lord prayed in Gethse-
mane, the spot where the disciples slept in a
row under a rock, with exact details as to
which disciple was at this end and
which one was at that end, the spot where
Peter cut off the ear of the high priest’s ser-
vant, the place of the Ascension, with the
Lord’s footprint plainly visible on the rock,
the precise scene of the utterance of the
Lord’s Prayer, a well belonging to that emin-
ent squatter Job, the place where the dis-
ciples met after the Crucifixion, the place
where Jesus wept over the forthcoming down-
fall of Jerusalem, the house of Mary and
Martha, the tomb of Lazarus, a large boulder
which Abraham brought from Hebron (pos-
sibly for road metal), the inn to which the
Good Samaritan brought the traveller who
fell among thieves, and a fountain at which
the disciples once stopped to drink.
Furthermore, the breathless and staggered
traveller has expounded to him the place
where the ravens fed Elijah, the mountain
on which the Saviour was tempted by Mephis-
tortheles, the fountain whereof the waters
were purified by Elijah, the scene of the
Israelitish crossing of the Jordan, the pre-
cise location of the Lord's baptism, a
fountain at which the Wise Men drank (they
saw the reflection of the Star of Bethlehem
in the water and nearly swallowed it in their
haste), the mark of a human body on a
large stone showing where Elijah lay down,
a footmark left by Elijah when he stood up
either before or after he lay down, Herod’s
grave, the grave of Rachel (wife or Jacob),
the well that David badly wanted to drink
out of, an underground sort of place in
which the Redeemer was born (the exact
spot is pointed out to an inch), and the
manger in which He was laid. This manger
is an affair of finely-polished marble and
much costly decoration ; it is probably worth
£6O of good British money, and it suggests
that the cow of old Judaea was a madly ex-
travagant animal. These last two shows
are located in a huge church like a fortress.
It has one door into which one person can
enter at a time in a stooping position, so
that the place can’t be rushed by large num-
bers of hostile individuals. As it is shared
by various Christian sects, a Turkish sol-
dier stands around at service time, armed,
and with a scoff on his countenance, to pre-
vent the denominations disembowelling one
another. There is nothing more reprehen-
sible than a disembowelled denomination.
The room where the innocents were mas-
sacred is also shown, though why they should
have been all brought together in one room
passes comprehension. As for such small
dust as the death-bed of Moses (seen in the
distance), the tomb of Moses, the location of
the baptism of the eunuch, the oak that
Abraham sat under, the field in which the
shepherds watched their flocks on the even-
ing of the nativity, the house of Tabitha, the
house of Simon the tanner, the yard in
which he tanned, and the well from which
he drew water to tan with, they are lying
around in heaps.
They have a wonderful memory for local-
ities, these coarse, shameless, polyglot frauds
of the city which is called Jerusalem, but
which, by reason of its ancient shoddiness,
is only Jerry. The sites which they so friskily
identify fall into three separate cate-
gories. The newest ones stand for events
which are blurred by the haze of some 1870
years, during which period the old Hebrew
metropolis was twice levelled to the ground
and made a mere heap of ruins, and a vast
proportion of the Jewish nation was des-
troyed, while the survivors were forbidden
to even approach the old site. Then Jeru-
salem, as hereinbefore mentioned, was re-
built, once by pagans, who had not the
slightest desire to preserve the old land-
marks, and who didn’t know the old judges,
the old kings, the old prophets, or the
apostles from a crow or a battleaxe; and
again it was rebuilt by a mixed race of ignor-
ant folk. The events of another series are still
older; the veil of some 26 centuries hangs
over them, and they are further blotted and
obliterated by Nebuchadnezzar’s extinguish-
ment of Jerusalem (the old city fled right
off the map three times) and by the great
Captivity. And the oldest stock or heap
of alleged facts is supposed to have
accurately survived, not only all these
vicissitudes, but also the long absence in
Egypt and the other troubles of some 4000
illiterate years. For these reasons the
stranger is . apt to look with a glassy eye on
Job’s well, and to lend a deaf ear to the
stone on which Jacob rested his head when
he had his famous vision.
Lies, ancient and modern, are the visible
means of support of southern Palestine.
Everywhere is found the pilgrim and the
stranger. Everywhere is found the holy sham
in a maddened hat waiting to take the pilgrim’s
money, and to show him in return the mark
left by the ear of Jeroboam’s uncle. Almost
the only things that can be seen gratis are
the Unspeakable Turk and the cave in which
Samson hid himself either just before or
just after he slew 1000 Philistines with the
jawbone of a common domestic animal. This
dry but notable hole lies close alongside the
Jaffa-Jerusalem railway line. It once, so
I was told, lay alongside the bridle track
further north, but it was removed when the
railway was built. Being a lonesome curi-
osity which herded together all by itself, it
was never a paying investment.
* * * »
Still there is some excuse for the confi-
dence man of Palestine, in all his Greek and
Roman and Abyssinian and Samaritan varie-
ties —the friar of orders grey and brown and
black, and the monk of the striped com-
munion, and the sandalled person with the
drab night-shirt and the rope round his
waist, who lives by exhibiting the dog-license
of the dog that licked Lazarus. He has to
exist, and existence is tough in old Canaan.
In some places, where the Unspeakable is
unusually rapacious, it is alleged that even
the olive trees are being cut down and sold
as timber, because the local boss Ottoman
taxes them so heavily that the industry is
cheaper dead than alive. But this tree-
felling doesn’t cause the souvenirs “made
from wood grown on the Mount of Olives”
to be any more reliable. Only a poor smat-
tering of foliaee remains bn the Mount of
Olives —probably not enough to keep the
trade in souvenirs going for a year. There
is no sign that new trees are being planted,
and the feeble haze or dandruff of old vege-
tation seems to be carefully preserved. It
is necessary to retain some faint pretence
of herbage on the Mount, else its name
would debase into utter mockery. Already
one can stand on the top of the historical
elevation, and look eastward across the land
of Benjamin and the Jordan and the Dead
Sea, and far into Moab, and not observe a
tree. When war happens there nowadays,
the general who is on the defensive takes up
a strong position behind a blade of grass, and
waits on events.

There is a Turkish coinage, but. except in
the shape of a battered and dirt-colored
small change, often as thin as a razor, and
with frequent holes bored through it, little
of it is seen. I bought a bottle of beer on
the border of Benjamin, at a two-roomed
PUBLICANS
BESIDE
THE
DEAD
SEA.
stone pub with no chimney, hardly any fur-
niture and an earthen floor. I gave French
money, and got English and French change.
I gave French money at a pub at Jericho,
and got French change. At a canvas and
brushwood cafe on the shore of the pictur-
esque Dead Sea—a place where four wild-
looking publicans wanted to hold my clothes
and my pocket-book while I had a swim—
I paid in Egyptian money, and received the
change of three countries. The native takes
Turkish money if necessary, but, if he can
get the French article, he shies at his own
like a horse which has found a dead donkey
in the middle of the road. There was such
an animal —old and half-eaten —on the high-
way between Jerusalem and Jericho; and
when my team saw the skeleton and the rag
of hide, it leaped sideways almost into
Gilead.
The Turkish post office is very much on a
par with the Turkish coinage. It is reputed
to lose one-half the letters, and to spend six
days in carrying the other half two miles.
Consequently Britain, France, Germany,
Austria and other countries have acquired
the right to run private post offices, so that
their subjects may hear occasionally from
home and mother.
Churches are everywhere—Greek Catholic,
Greek Orthodox, Syrian, Armenian, Abyssin-
ian, also sundries, casuals and heterodox,
odd-job churches, churches of no account,
joint-stock churches, in which various sects
run their various shows, with the Ottoman
infantry man on guard, to keep the mad-
dened but affectionate Christians apart,
Maronite tabernacles, holy fanes run by
holy fathers and holy brothers, establish-
ments run by persons with shaven heads and
sandalled feet, and others run by individuals
with assorted heads and mixed feet. These
are quite apart from the numerous mosques
and synagogues and the new mission
churches —Anglican, Lutheran, Presbyterian,
Roman Catholic, and those belonging to a
drizzle of smaller sects. In Palestine an old,
chronic religion doesn’t build a new church
because there is a possible congregation, but
because it has found a sacred or allegedly
sacred site. At Capernaum, whereof the
permanent population is now one ruined syna-
gogue, six large dogs and one brown priest
with a hat like a pelican in the wilderness,
some £lO,OOO are being spent on a church
which is to stand on the exact spot where
Jesus Christ addressed the people. A few
miles from old Shechem (now called Nab-
lous) a similar amount is being expended on
another church, which is to enclose, and pre-
vent people drinking at, the well where the
Lord conversed with the woman of Samaria.
Devout and weak-minded foreigners endow
these churches, in which the priests drone
out services to each other and to a congre-
gation of nobody at all, and the haunted and
haggard hat is carried on their behalf all
over the civilised world, year in and year
out. Even the old Samaritan sect, which
has only 170 surviving members, and which
possesses one school, in which six small
Samaritans and one Samaritan baby sit on
the floor and study Hebrew, has a synagogue
in the backest back slum of Nablous, and a
high priest who keeps a fruit stall, and an
indefatigable old belltopper into which the
tourist drops a franc under, protest. The
Samaritan Church was once a great institu-
tion, but it is dying for want of a birth-rate.
The young male Samaritan is ejected as a
limb of the Devil if he marries outside his
sect, and it is difficult to marry inside it, be-
cause the old male Samaritan makes part of
his income by selling his daughters to the
Unspeakable Turjs. #
Two-thirds of the property in Jerusalem
is said to belong to churches and mosques.
Everywhere are British, French and Ger-
man —also, here and there, Italian and Rus-
sian—hospitals, but the Turkish hospital is
almost as scarce as an elephant up a tree.
Outside Nazareth is an unfinished English
hospital. Some Turkish official demanded
backsheesh when the roof was about to be
put on. Not being mollified with the article,
he reported to headquarters that the English
were erecting a fort, and that the red stan-
dard of revolt would presently go up in
Galilee; so the terrified imperial ass at By-
zantium stopped the work there and then.
Now a new and allegedly reformed imperial
ass—he is also said to be a drinky and alco-
holic ass—rules at Byzantium, but the pro-
hibition has not been removed.
The French road enables the traveller to
reach old Shechem (now called Nablous),
where many of the streets are tunnels, being
roofed over for the convenience of ladies
and cats, who want to pay visits from one
house-top to another. No vehicle can go
through Shechem, and the old part of the
town was last cleaned up by Jacob, that
smooth and plausible man who looms so
large in early Scripture history.
* * * *
Samaria, once the capital of the northern
kingdom, is honest by comparison with Jeru-
salem. It only charges the visitor for a
view of the prison of John the Baptist.
There is a single two-storey house in Sam-
aria nowadays, and it belongs to a wealthy
and influential sheik. Four windows, with-
out glass, but richly decorated with iron
bars, ornament the front. Two of them are
blocked with loose storjes to prevent the
excited populace looking in at the harem or
the harem looking out at the infuriated pop-
ulace, and behind these bars and stones the
ladies of the family enjoy all the discomforts
of a home. In the men’s quarter is the
oumial reception room, splendidly furnished
with a beehive-shaped stone roof, a bare
stone floor, two wide window ledges and six
cushions. There the sheik, a perfect gentle-
man with a considerable reputation as a
"'■'et. supplied in quick succession one glass
Of lemon water, two cups of tea, one cup of
coffee, and many cigarettes. From the win-
dow ledge I looked on the proud old capital.
Outside its present bounds are remnants of
the stupendous walls, some bits of the
ancient temple, and a few pillars to repre-
sent Herod’s market place. The crooked
ways of the present town are from three to
five feet wide, and suggest a stormy sea sud-
denly petrified and covered with offal, grey-
ish dust and hens. Apparently Israel sup-
plied eggs to the surrounding country. The
pale-grey houses are from five to eight feet
high. In the lower ones the doorway is 4ft.
high, and inside the taller folk live doubled
un. There is no window glass in Samaria.
Wealthy citizens have a breathing hole in
the wall. The poorer and more debased
sorts breathe through the doorway. Furni-
ture is practically unknown. The roofs
were once flat, but the pallid debris of ages
has cnanged them into bumpy hillocks
whereon the local fowl claws precariously.
* * * *
There is no road to Samaria, nor to the
older Israelitish capital of Jezreel; but then
in the land of the Unspeakable it has been es-
timated that four towns and villages out of
five have no road to them. Presumably
there was a highway in the great days
when Ahab, the king, drove forth to war
from the gates of his fortified metropolis,
with the banner of Abraham in front, and
his mighty men of valor to left and right,
and the local small boy hanging on to the
tail of the chariot behind, for the small boy
is the same in all lands and all ages. Now
it is just possible to drive to a spot two miles
from the historical city, and after that the
stranger proceeds on foot and reaches his
destination on all fours. Still if one can
overcome the natural obstacles, he is al-
lowed to arrive nowadays—also to depart.
It was not always thus. In the earlier days
of Abdul Hamid, to be seen going anywhere,
except with vegetables for sale, was a sus-
picious circumstance, and to be seen coming
back from anywhere was almost fatal. Abdul
Hamid was so anxious that his own brother
(now Sultan) should not commit the indis-
cretion of going anywhere, that he kept him
shut up for 30 years—it is alleged, without
anything to read. Therefore that brother
was worse off than the old nurse in “The
Gondoliers,” who was supplied with all the
illustrated papers in the torture chamber.
Some time in the dim backyard of his-
tory the Turkish Government decided to
build some 40 or 50 miles of new road by
way of supplying a short cut into Galilee.
It is wrestling hard with the section be-
tween Nablous and Jenin, and this was
officially declared open a few months ago.
The only drawbacks I found were (1) that
a three-mile stretch of the road at the
Nablous end was so new that it wasn’t made
at all, and it was necessary to drive uphill
and down over the crops of maddened agri-
culturists; (2) that a five-mile stretch at
the Jenin end was so old that it was over-
grown with brambles, and, as the horses
wouldn’t face them, it was again necessary
to rush over the crops; (3) that the middle-
aged section of the road had about 12 unfin-
ished bridges, so 12 times more it was neces-
sary to rush downhill over the crops and
uphill again to regain the road. We did 25
miles in nine hours. The last 16 miles of
the Turkish road, from Nazareth to Tibe-
rius. are regarded as a nine hours’ job in the
wet season.
Beside the blue and beautiful Sea of Gali-
lee one can intercept that infuriated snail,
the Turkish train, taking its headlong way
along the Turkish railway. There is only
one Turkish railway in Syria; all the others
are French. The great Ottoman steam
vehicle is timed to sprint 176 miles in 12
hours. In my case it reached Damascus
nearly four hours late, chiefly through its
habit of stopping half an hour at stations,
where the legitimate and authorised pause
was 10 minutes. So long as daylight lasted,
the friends of the driver and fireman rallied
round them at every stoppage and asked for
news. The driver and fireman squatted on
the platform and told the news—told of the
twins and the cholera and the robberies and
the scandals and the backsheesh. Some-
times they even played cards. There was a
pleasant swapping of lies and cigarettes, and
everything was cheery and casual. The sta-
tion-master blew his horn now and then as
a sign that the Turkish train was to resume
its wonderful Turkish journey ; but it didn't
start till the driver felt inclined. He was
said to be an invalid who suffered greatly
from insomnia on the engine, so doubtless
the station-master extended to him a special
measure of consideration. One station-
master told me that the engine was 45 years
old. and he gave me the name of a Turkish
official who, he said, had gone to France to
buy new engines, and had purchased old
scrap-heap locomotives for a song in order
that he might pocket the difference. He
didn’t seem to regard the proceeding as un-
usual, or to think that the eminent Turk
would be angry at this public mention of the
event.
The water supply on this breathless Turk-
ish express had dried up, and there were no
towels. Also the lamps went out as soon as
they were lighted.
I failed to find out what explanation the
Turkish driver gives when he drives his red-
hot Turkish train into that picturesque, rav-
ing dust-heap called Damascus, four hours
behind his due date. I fancy, though, that
he says: (1) It is the will of Allah; (2) he
didn’t notice the time; (3) the water went
“off the boil.”
Damascus, viewed from the hills, is a
beautiful white city, set in a dense wilder-
ness of orchards. Viewed from within, it is
just Damascus. The Abana River roars
through the old place, and makes it look
cooler and cleaner than it really is. Many
European drinks are sold there, but it is
generally necessary to find the landlord iu
his lair, and wake him up, in order to get
the drink. It is possible to drive through
this venerable capital of Benhadad, but
often the wheels scrape the walls on each
side. And when the Corporation has dug a
huge hole in the middle of a narrow street,
and forgotten all about it for five weeks, the
only resource is to take out the horses and
lead them around the gaping orifice, and
then hire the neighboring population, at two
for a franc, to lift the carriage over the ob-
struction.
At Damascus the polite and voluble drago-
man shows the exact spot on the wall where
Paul, the apostle, was lowered in a basket.
He also adds, quite cheerfully, that the wall
was built by Saladin, the Sultan, more than
1000 years after Paul was dead.
Beyond Damascus lies Baal-bek, the city
of gigantic ruins, in the walls of which there
A BUSY STREET IN NABLOUS.
are single stones weighing 800 tons. The
local guide book says that, 133 years after
the Creation, Cain built Baal-bek “in a
moment of frenzy.” So Cain evidently had
his crowded moments. The guide book also
says that the mastodon must have been em-
ployed to carry the stones, and the fact of
the mastodon being alive in Cain’s time
proves that Cain was the architect. But it
is just possible that Cain, who, according to
some Syrian theories, was 150 ft. high, car-
ried the stones himself.
And further on is Lebanon, the mountain
Paradise of a neglected land. It is mostly a
Christian country. Years ago the French
Government, giving way to sudden excite-
ment, bought itself a club, and hit the Un-
speakable so hard on the head that Lebanon
has had ever since a Christian Governor and
a Christian militia., and the Unspeakable’s
troops are kept out of the district. And as
a result Lebanon is a fairly clean country,
with good roads, abundant hotels and a gen-
eral air of prosperity. But beyond it the
old Turkish misery starts again. If the
Ottoman were boiled he might be hearable,
but in his raw state he looks like one of the
world’s calamities.

Niobe.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
THE grey magicians, deathless, wise,
Into the null and void down gazed
And there hung awful destinies —
Wild worlds which spun, mad suns that blazed—
And life, awakening, staggered dazed
Where thunders, hounding, bayed and pealed.
In headlong flight through Chaos crazed
The spheres in hot quadrillions reeled.
The grey magicians made them Grief,
That woman of the wond’rous eyes
Plumbed with a sorrowing past belief
That yearns, that sears, that never dies.
Enthroned upon a cloud of sighs
They crowned her with the Might-Have-Been.
Their heralds through the star-strewm skies
Went swiftly to proclaim her Queen.
In the lone bush as evening falls,
And darkness gathers, tree by tree,
When Night comes with her plumes and palls,
Oh, mournful grows the soul of me.
A bloodless, witless wight is he
With heart of marble, eye of stone,
That sorrows not with Niobe,
Who weeps amid the trees alone.
Hear the hoarse greeting of the sea
When the Grief Queen walks by the shore ;
When the wind-wolves tumultuously
Hunt in fierce packs o’er Ocean’s floor ;
Where the huge billows sink and soar ;
And solemn surges plumed and grand
Boom their dread dirge of Evermore
In thunder on the shuddering sand.
Steal honeyed joys from Beauty’s lips,
Speed rosy hours that fly so fast ;
Pour the red wine where Virtue slips,
And gild the future, drug the past,
To find all mirth is overcast,
Our raptures one by one escape —
Yes ! the dull dawn has come at last,
And Niobe in robes of crape.
Then let us laugh (for fear we weep)
From our soft couch of perfumed sins ;
Drink in the ecstasies which leap
From tense mirth-maddened violins.
Lo ! At our blithest then begins
The soul to sorrow, and appears ,
Behind the hollow mask which grins •
A drawn white face all Stained with tears.

The Rise and Fall of Walmatta.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
IT began absent-mindedly. A swagman
lit a fire under a tree where two stock
routes crossed. His luck was out. Two
more swagmen came along and asked him
what he was doing.
“Nothin’,” he said.
“So’s me an’ me mate. Got a bob?”
“Two,” said Jones. One of the new arri-
vals drew out a pack of cards.
“Let’s make ourselves more comfy-like,”
saiu Jones at the end of the third day. He
built a brush hut. The new arrivals de
parted, not wiser though poorer. The o -
lowing morning a mob of cattle appealed.
“What place do you call this?” asked the
backbone of the country, looking down at
the pack of cards Jones was idly shuffling,
his elbows on a stump.
“Dunno,” said Jones, without looking up.
The backbone flicked a bot fly from under
his horse’s chin.
<4 I thought it was TYalmatta, he said.
“What’s trumps?” Jones dealt a hand oppo-
site his own.
“You can make ’em what yer like, said
Jones. . • '
“Done,” said tbebackbohe of the land, dis-
mounting and picking up the hand. . At the
end of the fourth day Jones acquired the
buggy and 1 horse. The backbone of the na-
tion was getting interested, and hired the
lost buggy that he might send one of his
hands for supplies.
“I mus’ build a ’ut,” said Jones some
hours after the supplies arrived, or that
stuff o’ mine’ll spoil if it comes on wet. Bj
this time Jones had won the supplies. The
stock were driven on to replenish the purse
of the backbone of the country. At the end
of the week a neat bark hut was on the cor-
ner of the cross roads. More travellers
drifted, past, and Jones built up two more
rooms. A month passed quietly.
“This place is gettin’ dull,” murmured
Jones. Then three men came along on bi-
cycles.
“Got any pizen?” asked one, dismounting
and wiping plenteous moisture from his face.
“A bob a nip,” said Jones.
“We’re too tired an’ thirsty to haggle with
a brigand,” said the first bicyclist. Three
hours later they were drunk. Three days
later they left. Jones built a kitchen, then
disappeared' for a week. Afterwards the
kitchen chimney never ceased from smoking.
“What’s the name of this place?” asked a
swagman passing one day.
“I remember as somebody called it Wal-
matta,” said Jones.
“Blast it!” said the swagman. He had
arrived with only five shillings. Jones used
the ss. to buy a sign labelled “Walmatta.
Fine place for soft drinks.”
On an average of once a week stock passed,
and as it did so, prosperity illumined the
path of Jones. His luck at cards held good,
and his charge for drinks was exorbitant.
He called the dtinks soft as a matter of
form. A pile of broken glass grew week by
week behind the bark shanty, to which were
added skillions at the back and a verandah
in front.
One day an unusually well-dressed stranger
approached on horseback. He looked full-
pursed. Instead of calling for a drink, he
demanded a bedroom. With some disap-
pointment Jones led him to a skillion.
“I want it for a month,” said the stranger.
Jones grew darkly suspicious, but redoubled
his politeness. Only police and excisemen
could be so liberal witn their time.
The stranger was melancholy, which made
Jones sympathetic.
“You don’t look cheerful, mate,” he said
persuasively.
“I’m as merry as the day is long. There’s
an air of freedom, a feeling of unlimited
space about here that is exhilarating. To a
nerve-wracked city man it is Elysium.”
“What’s Elysioom?” asked Jones.
“A brand of drink. You supply it with-
out charge.”
“No, yer don’t, mate. I supplies nothin’
without charge. An’ me drink’s honest.”
The stranger gazed at him pityingly.
“You don’t realise all you supply.” Jones
looked sick and edged away. “Don’t go,”
said the stranger. “I like talking to you.”
Jones looked more sick, and backed into his
shanty. There he sat down to think. The
stranger got on his horse and rode away.

Frantic suspicion gnawed at the vitals of
Jones. The thing was not understandable,
The stranger no longer went out riding,
but gloomily hung about the bark shanty,
often gazing at the kitchen chimney. Each
day the newcomer mounted and rode away,
At evening he returned, always looking
pleased; then the two went off in earnest
admiration of the gumtrees.
“I admire this place, Tom, and I mean
business,” said Bill one night. Jones over-
heard, and a dull sensation seized upon the
pit of his stomach. Next day his chimney
fire ceased smoking, except at meal times,
When the newcomer rode away, Jones
slouched sideways towards the stranger,
hitched his trousers, and leered half-deferen-
tially into his face.
“ ’ls game ain’t fair,” said Jones, tenta-
tively. The stranger looked at him sadly.

“Not when he has half a million behind

sprawling commodiously on a rug.
“This is the smallest of your duties,
Madge,” said Bill, scrawling on to the grass
beside the rug. He tickled the baby with a
straw ; but he watched the girl in white',
w ith her sunbrowned face and arms.
“This is real life,” he said. “The hum of
insects, the moo of cows, the smell of apples,
0 f SU n-warmed grass. There’s no equal to
it.” The baby squealed with delight.'
“Just listen to that! All the joy of the
birds, the sun and the sky in its voice. It's

sane people.”
Madge said nothing.
“I hate it,” said Tom, standing upright. “I

lights and trams and theatres and people,

of its simplicity. Jones is simple enough for
me. Good-bye, Madge.”
“Call him back, Bill,” said Madge,
“Not I. I don’t agree with his senti-
ments.”
“Tom,” called Madge. When he turned
she was peeling apples.
“What is it, Madge?”
“I love the city best, I think.”

Tom stayed till,late in the evening, but
Bill caught his horse and rode back to Wal-
matta. He found it a smoking ruin. There
were no signs of the owner. With a certain
languid anxiety he poked among the debris
for the burnt remains of Jones. He didn’t
find them, but amid the wreckage of the
chimney he came on what might have been
the remains of a still.
Jones was far away, fleeing madly over
the landscape to keep ahead of imaginary
excisemen; and Walmatta was no more,

The Fire Hog.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
IT would be hard to say what Ruffy’s idea
of a day’s work was. He would squat
for hours together doing nothing at all
sometimes. Then perhaps he would scramble
up a tree, and along one of its boughs to the
farthest end, where he would hang by his
hands, and get a sweeping up-and-down swing
on the bough. At last he would drop off
adroitly, when he came near enough to the
ground, and would watch the effect of the
branch’s rebound. Then he would do it over
and over again. A simple thing like that
would last him half a day, and then, like as
not, it would be lunch time.
At other times he would knock two pieces
of stone together, just to hear them hit. It
was innocent, and amused him vastly, and
was at any rate as good as playing billiards
in the Bull and Mouth. He would knock
two stones together till he smashed one, and
get as much satisfaction out of it as if he’d
kicked a goal.
One day, with one of these bashes, a spark
or two came —absolutely the first fire ever
beheld by mortal Link.
One of the stones was darker than the
othei 1 , and must have had some iron in it, but
whatever it was it sufficiently astonished
Ruffy, and he went on desperately with his
pounding, to get those sparks again, with
more or less success.
When tired of that in its turn, and his
knuckles a bit worn, he gathered up some
of the pieces and ran off to his cave to nlant
them —for the Links were very secretive, and
would hide sticks and stones and things, to
get them again. The idea of property was
even thus eai-ly developed.
And it just shows what an undiscriminat-
ing sort of mind Ruffy’s was, that he left
behind him, after all, the only piece that mat-
tered —the dark stone that had really made
the sparks. But another and much longer-
headed Link had been watching Ruffy. He
noticed this dark stone at once, and, poun-
cing on it, took it off to his cave. He prob-
ably succeeded in making sparks, too, for in
the middle of the night, when the Links were
asleep and all nature bathed in stilly gloom,
what time the Carnivora Gigantica were
abroad and padding round for prey, wild
yells broke out from Vulky’s cave, followed
almost immediately by the screaming family
itself, and huge, dense volumes of black, curl-
ing smoke. The smoke smothered all the
camp, and frightened it still more, so that the
pack, never having seen fire before, was much
too alarmed to enter its caves again, and
spent a most uncomfortable night in the open
air. Fortunately the wild beasts of the field
were frightened off the locality too, so no
harm came. In the morning the Links mi-
grated and picked another abiding place, for
to stay there after such an uncanny occur-
rence was out of the question.
As for Vulky, he was so like a singed cat
that his best friends did not know him, and,
as the Links neither liked nor understood
anything unduly strange, he was urgently but
firmly given to undei-stand that for the future
he must row in another boat. And, as there
was about as much family affection among
the Links then as there is to-day among the
gohannas, the wife and kin of Vulky also
heartily shared in this repudiation of him,
and refused to tolerate for a moment so
ridiculous and smirchy a father and hus-
band.
Hence Vulky became a nomad, driven to
shift for himself, and fish his living as best
be could out of the cruel primeval surround-
ings of his time. Luckily, although a bit
scorched and badly frighted, the outbreak
had not seemed quite so unearthly to him as
to the others. He did not quite understand
it, of course, but he knew something of its
coming about. And, having nowhere to go
now, he wandered back toward the camp that
the rest had deserted, although it was a long-
time before he plucked up courage enough
to enter that old cave of his, which he had
last beheld lit up by the blaze of the family
bedding (dry grass and ferns).
Otherwise the place looked harmless
enough, and Vulky got so fa.r over his fears
as to be joyful at finding his black stone
again, the thing he had made the sparks
with. Fie eagerly picked it up. Playing
with it had become a sort of vice with him,
like drink, and as hard to leave off.
Then a still smouldering stick among the
ashes caught his eye, and he fished it out and
fell to examining it. He knew really little as
yet about the nature of fire, and this inter-
ested him greatly. Evidently wood burned!
Vulky may even then have had some idea
that this red, stinging, hot matter might
some day, when it got to be studied more,

Already it had hurt him. It might hurt
otners —his enemies, perhaps, next time ! tie
collected smouldering sticks.
It was a wonderful thing, this fire! The
lordly Dinosaur, or Swallowall, Chief Satrap
and Padishah of all Creation, wandering-
round in the peaceful gloaming for his. even-
ing’s chew, was totally unawai’e of the exist-
ence of such an element. He looked in on
Vulky quite casually, as one might at the
pork butcher’s, on his way home from the
theatre, for a titbit for supper. The Swal-
lowall was surprised to find the camp de-
serted, and he was not altogether pleased
either. The Links had occupied that spot
for five summers, and it lay convenient to his
accustomed rounds, and he, like the rest,
hated changes. He was still more surprised,
on sniffing about, to find that one of the
caves was apparently not quite empty. The
Dinosaur never entered any cave in search of
prey. That would have been impossible to
such a monster, and his fine, supple, spine-
embossed neck of eight or nine feet long made
it unnecessary. It was easy for him, with a
kind of scoop, to make a sweeping inquiry
into every corner while he stood outside —
the main part of him.
He came so quietly that Vulky, wrapped
up in his scientific pursuits, did not know he
was there till he saw his horrible head, about
the size of a cottage piano, right up against
him. Then he got more alarmed than some
people do when they see a tarantula, and the
burning stick he held in his hand dropped
from sheer palsy!
One of the brute’s great, blowing, sniffing
nostrils was offensively touching his elbow,
and the hot end of the stick fell right into
it!
That saved Vulky’s life. He never knew
exactly what happened. He was suddenly
knocked against the side of the cave. There
was a lightning disappearance of some yards
of head and neck structure, drawn noisily
out through the hole with a roughness that
brought some of the roof down. That was
all he knew till he got up and peeped out.
The Dinosaur was noisily examining liis in-
juries with some snorting, and seemed to be
absurdly nice about recovering some particu-
lar variety of snuffle that was apparently
lost for ever.
Vulky, seeing it so wrapped up, and with
its head the other way, made bold to throw
a hot stick at it, and in cowardly fashion ran
back into the cave. The stick set light to the
grass under the Dinosaur’s hindquarters, and
soon could be felt along the ground the thud,
thud that these vast creatures made when
they moved recklessly, and leaped two
fathoms at a time.
The Dinosaur was going straight home, and
thinking as it went. It decided never to call
on him again under any circumstances what-
ever. In fact, it made up its mind to recon-
sider the whole question of its status in crea-
tion, and its relations to the Links in particu-
lar.
Vulky, the half monkey, in his cave, found
out that embers could be raked together and
fed with sticks, which was most important,
for presently he made a blaze come again.
That was the origin of the fire that he after-
wards made up outside his cave, and he
took care to keep it going. And that night
he sallied forth in a buccaneer spirit towards
the new Link camp, holding a lighted stick in
each hand. He scai-ed away every living
soul of them, and then foraged round for food
and flints and skins and other things he
wanted.
But he came back on his ear, for they met
him returning with his loot—his torches dead
out and flung away. They recognised him
instantly as plain Vulky, without trimmings,
and he had to flee before them. A mad,
screaming time it was while he fought for
his life and was mauled and hunted by the
horde, but he got through to Sanctuary, to
his City of -Refuge, his beloved cave —he
knew none would ever follow him in there.
Better luck next time! Nothing could
save those Links ! Vulky knew too much,
and before he ventured to raid them again
lie had learned a deal more. Pine wood,
light and resinous —that burned well! And
the sight of him, brandishing two great
blazing torches, brought all their old fears
back, and he did what he liked with them,
and took what he wanted. One night he
paralysed them by setting fire to the grass
in half a dozen places right at their very
dooi-s, and they fled all ways. He marked
one of the plumpest for his own, and followed
her as she ran screaming. Terror took all
the fight out of her, and a touch of the fire-
stick did the rest, leaving her limp and
senseless. So he managed to balance her
over his back, and staggered off through the
woods to his den with her.
With the community of our ancestors the
situation was intolerable. Links could not
live! There were no longer residential
rights! No longer rest and safety—only the
mortal dread of a bogey devil, 10 times worse
than the Ichthyosaurus, a devil that stole
their bodies and substance, from whom there
was no deliverance, go where they would!
Not even in stormy Chartist or Eureka
times was the indignation of a people more
thoroughly roused. Even monkey blood will
boil in time over repeated injuries.
What was this outlaw against a whole
tribe that he should defy them? They would
smother their fears! They would go in a
body and pull him bone from bone.
A CON-
CESSION.
“ Give us a suck o'
yer toffee, Lucy."
“No, I won't l But you may kiss me while
my motif is sticky."
But, when they got there, all that'
valor melted away, and they could
only tremble. A brisk fii’e burnt in
front of Vulky’s cave—weird dancing
flames that were alive flickered in
the blackness, and they quailed at the sight
like all the rest of creation. That fire kept
him sacred. No living thing would approach
it! Vulky, the fire maniac, knew his exist-
ence depended on it, and it was kept well
fed and attended. That was his “mate’s”
department. She knew pretty well now that
if its light went out, hers would be put out
too. Vulky had taught her! He knew lots
about fire now. Of course he knew it was
hot. He had good reason to from the first,
and had put the matter beyond all doubt
since, by holding his wife up to it. He got
into a way of doing this, instead of whack-
ing her. It was more interesting, and less
bother, so she generally sported a singed,
hairless patch or two somewhere or other.
At times the Links, impelled by curiosity,
would creep up and blink through the trees
at his fire, and they got more and more used
to it until their pluck rallied again. Later
on they gathered round, one dismal night, an
immense pack, all loaded with heavy missiles,
desperately anxious to do bodily injury, and
were astonished to find no fire, no dancing
flames, no curling smoke! There was only
the dark mouth of the cave, and out of it
came shocking screams that raised goose-
flesh to hear! Again they trembled, and
were utterly routed, and bounded off wildly
through the brushwood back again, and the
great awe and mystery of Vulky became
more wrapped up than ever.
As a matter of fact, a dreadful thing had
happened. Vulky’s missus had let the fire
out. The only fire in creation had gone dead,
and all had to be done (if evermore done at
all) all over again! And Vulky blamed the
woman, and was still blaming her.
That was the last of Vulky’s cave, for
afterwards he crept forth, along, clutching
his old sparkmaker, and wandered, loose
and unattached, and more than ever irre-
sponsible, to where there was much dry
grass, where his sparks could have another
chance. Ere many days his whereabouts
was known to all concerned by pillars of
smoke by day, and fire by night, and all
neighborhoods he came to were turned into
smoking ash-liills, with his bonfires. He
revelled among them, intoxicated with the
smell of burning, and never so happy as
when he could scarce see for smoke. But
his chief, particular delight was to hunt the
Links out of one hole into anothei’. He
would flank them with a long train of brush-
wood and fire it. Coming up behind them
with his firesticks, he would drive them like
a lot of cattle before him. He would light
a circle of fires around them at night, and
watch them dance inside it. Or he would
burn off a whole hillside and scax - e them
with the screaming of the wild fowl and
scampering of animals, and the crashing to-
gether of the trees into sheaves of sparks.
And soon the apotheosis came! A day
when the wind got up, and took everything
out of his hands.
Bonfires gave way to blazing forests all
round. They burned night and day with
a fiei-ceness and to an extent that nothing
could quench, and that left nowhere to flee to.
It was a doomed country, full of wild, singed,
fleeing animals, some of which weighed
as much as 80 tons. And in the midst of it
was mad Vulky, the Fire Hog, exulting to
the last. “I started it!” he shouted. “Alone
I did it!”
* * # #
The very next day was cold and bleak.
Another change of wind had set in in the
night, bringing with it a deluge that had ex-
tinguished all fires, and left the land a heap
of damp ashes.
The very secret of fire had perished. There
was no smoulder left, nor anyone capable of
lighting one. Another aeon or two must now
pass ere food be cooked or shins warmed at
friendly hearths.
Away in the coming
Stone Age, perhaps,
some flint-axe artist
would rediscover the
vital spark!
Or, in some hot
country, a branch
would, in a high wind,
rub itself into ignition
against another branch!
Perhaps when men
were really men, and
would know better
what to do with it, and
not play monkey
tricks!
The remnant of our
band of ancestors, all
that was left of them,
ventured forth more
dead than alive, from
the crevice that had
been their refuge, and
streaked wearily over
the grey, desolate
plains, a sori-y lot,
with tails scarce long
enough to carry be-
tween their legs, but
pointing that way.
They hung together
with craven fear, not
quite sure, as they
crawled along, that the
very ground was not
still alive. Lost, cold,
ravenous, they poked
about for flotsam and
jetsam, hoping, perad-
venture, there might
be something to eat
anywhere among the
ashes. Desperation
killed their fears. They
seai-ched about even
among big, charred
logs that were still
warm, and close by
one of these they
found a roasted car-
case, well-browned,
and not yet cold.
And although cooked meat was not in
vo°ue in our family at that time, one would
eat even that if he could get no other.
First, the boldest and hungriest of them
hooked off a piece of crackling with his finger
and tried it, the rest watching him anxiously.
Presently he/took another help, and after
that there was not a dull moment.
It was not alone the crackling. The dish
was good all through. The flesh simplv slid
off the bones into the mouth, with the ample
sauce of its own succulent juices—good
honest roast, with none of the oven about it.
It was. in fact, the Fire Hog done to a
turn, and they had discovered roast pig be-
fore the Chinamen, after all!

Gypsy Blood.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
BE it wide as half Australia, yet a
boundary you define,
And the Gypsy is in prison if he can-
not cross the line;
He may camp awhile in cities, though he
never makes a home,
And he’ll rest and wait contented, for he
knows the call will come!
For the Gypsies starved in prisons, dying
hard and dying slow,
Just for loving God’s own sunshine in free
England, long ago;
But the spirit broke the prisons, and the
spirit kept the vow,
Till they are the only people who are free
in England now.
“You go West!” says Law or Custom, and
he heeds not in the least—
that face to face the daybreak meets
the Gypsies tramping East!
“Go you North!” say Law and Custom —-
sign, or screed, or word of mouth ;
And the ghastly daybreak darkens on a
Gypsy faring South!
“This is Truth,” says fair-faced friendship,
and we ask not how, nor why—
He says nothing, but he always acts as
though it were a lie.
“You do this,” say Law and Custom, soft
and gentle, sharp or flat,
And his camp-fire after midnight shows the
Gypsy doing that.
(For they sold us through the ages till a
cunning race are we,
And we camp not and we tramp not with
their pale-eyed treachery;
We stay longest where we may not, only
going when we must,
And our peonle follow swiftly by the pateran
in the dust.)
He has wisdom old as China—let the world
think as it will —
And, in spite of his wild spirit, he has
patience older still;
There are many signs, my children, by which
you may recognise.
But the heartache, pain, or hunger never
shows in Gypsy eyes.
He has fire and food and shelter, when it
rains, for hunted men,
And from out his store of cunning lie can
help them on again;
For the craft of being hunted, and of hiding,
has been his,
Since the gallows trees of England groaned
with Gypsy carcases.
They bore brats beneath the gallows who
should take the place of these,
And their queens divided England ’twixt the
tribes and families —
They marked out the land and shared it,
holding silent, sullen sway,
And lived over it, and on it, as they do unto
this day.

HENRY LAWSON.
A Marrying Man.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
HE could he heard bounding on the stairs
20sees. before he arrived on the bag
flat (top floor), like the humorous
object shot up a trap in the pantomime. He
was a total stranger, apparently a son of
toil in unusual and unseasonable garments,
and his temperature was 19 points above
normal. He had no time for the niceties of
social usage. Prodding the nearest paster
with a short, indurated, imperious forefinger,
he gasped :
“You, there, will yeh marry me?”
Priscilla Hill, his first choice, being fair
and young, saw little need for this urgency,
and took cover, armed for defence with a
brush full of paste.
The stranger had no iron predilections. His
hardened digit travelled to the second girl,
Stella Gateway.
“You then?” he blurted.
Stella stood as if the fate of Lot’s wife
had overcome her in the performance of her
humble duties, and stared at the impetuous
suitor.
The man-anxious-to-marry hammered on
her pasting board with hot impatience.
“Dammitall, can’t yeh answer a civil ques-
tchin?” he wailed. “You then —will yeh
marry me?” His finger jabbed Miss Oddie.
It had never happened before to Miss Oddie.
She uttered a faint cry, and fell back into
10,000 paper hags. “You? You?” The
finger went to Ollie Cromwell (16), and Miss
Josephine Egg(4l once). Ollie broke and fled.
It was all so new and strange that before
Josephine could close with him the finger
had passed to Mitty Smith.
“Golmighty!” cried the intended bride-
groom, “whatsa matter with the offer? It’s
fair dink, i tell yeh. Here’s me wants a wife
fer better ’r worse, all in, ’n’ the odds be jig-
gered. Ain’t there no takers? You—it with
the squint? I want a wife. The case is
urgent. The place is waitin’. Be a sport,
Tilly; it’s yer last charnce.”
Mitty Smith did not quail; she skewered
him straight and fair with her best eye, and
held him for a trying moment.
It was a thrilling crisis. There were on
the factory fiat close upon 100 girls of all
ages from 13 to 50, to each of whom marriage
was the ultimate dim Thule, the remote
possibility. And here was a rash stranger,
not as plain as a cat possessed of a devil nor
as poor as a benighted flea on a wooden
Highlander, ravenc usfy demanding any old
hand in marriage. It on • remained for a
spinster to snatch at Liin. The factory was
spellbound.
George Mills, head packer, who had been gap-
ing at Ilaste-to-the-Wedding like a man who
sees green lobsters oozing from the bottles,
and hears gohannas singing in the cheese,
was the first to recover his faculties. He
went softly to the blowpipe, and whistled
up the powers of darkness in the lower
level.
“Hello!” he said. “Ring in a hone cart
’n’ police assistance fer three. Here's a
maddo offerin’ marriage to all ours.”
“Ahr, come back when you’re sober!” said
a thin voice in the pipe.
“It’s gostruth. He’s Billy Breathless from
the Madmen’s Shelter. He’s proposed to
the bunch, bar none; ’n’ if somethin’ ain’t
done all iv a sudden, ten t’ one lie’ll be
killed in the rush.”
Meanwhile the young man in a hurry was
knocking impatiently on the work-board of
Miss Mitty Smith.
"Well, well, well!” he cried. “Jimmy Jee!
Let’s have it. ’Ere’s me ’and in wedlock.
Take it or leave it.”
Mitty’s lips tightened, a dash of red
bloomed in her lank cheeks. “Straight, d’yeh
mean it?” she said.
“S’elp me!” The sprint suitor wet his
forefinger on his tongue, and drew it across
his throat with horrid suggestiveness.
“Wisher may die,” he said.
“ ’N’ yeh don't drink?”
“Never touch it much. Got honorable
mention from No. 9 tent iv the Fightin’
Reckerbites.”
“What about workin’?”
“Stiddy ez a church. Four years on the
lorry fer Gorse ’n’ Hackermann. Cudn’t
shift me with a winch.”
“Yer racketty. Yeh scatter it on ’orses
or et two-up.” To Mitty he seemed too
good to be true.
“S’trewth, not ever! When I marry, no
other wimmin’s in it with me ’uinble; ’n’ I
don’t wear out nothin’ on the ’orses, nor toss
fer nuts. Lumme, ’ere’s Ned’ll speak fer
me.” The stranger dragged Mills forward.
“Known me since I was a kid. He’ll take
his solemn oat’ I’m square ’n’ sober, ’n’ good
t’ mother.”
“I can certify he ain’t been hung fer
stranglin’ his aunt,” said the packer; “but
there me privit ’n’ confidential infermation
ends. Never saw him in me life before.”
“Ellen Tommy!” wailed the rapid marrier,
“carn’t a man give hisself away with a pound
iv tripe? Here, I say, Sis”
He was trying it on another, but Mitty
jumped in, and closed with him. “Done!”
she cried. “I’m on to it.”
Mitty's decision precipitated a rush. Up-
roar broke loose. The girls scrambled about
the promised bride, offering gibes, encourage-
ment and advice.
“But what iv Nicko Jimm?” asked a
limp folder.
“What iv Nicko Jimm?” repeated
Mitty Smith with intense scorn. “This is
where it’s rocked into Mister Nicko Jimm.
Nicko Jimm! Thinks he got me with a
thousan’ tea-wrappers, don’t he? Well,
now’s when he finds out.” Mitty was truly
desperate.
“Time flies,” said the bridegroom, fever-
ishly. “Don’t keep the church waitin’.”
“What!” gasped Mitty ; “yeh mean right
now ?”
“Just ez quick ez you can pin a hat on.
Here’s the irons.” He plucky a wedding
rinv from his pocket and held it aloft. “S,tep
out! I gotter parson sittin’ on the mat, ’n’
four bob’s worth iv fresh-cut paper roses
bloomin’ on the chapel wall. There’s nothin’
t’ waste, so show yer speed limit.”
Roseann Mack and Hoppy Witherfie vol-
unteered as bridesmaids, and rushed Mitty
to the dressing-room. Fuzzy Ellis, the fore-
man, flurried down the stair seeking the -
majesty of Spatt’s, the senior partner, who
alone could grapple with an emergency like
this.
The bridegroom leaned against the packer’s
board, and fanned himself with his hat, and
Mills gazed upon him, with the curious regard
we feel for all demented creatures.
“Can these things be?” said Mr. Mills.
“Think she’ll hold to it?” /asked the
stranger, nodding sideways towards the
changing-room.
“Think she’ll ’old to it? Will a nigger
’old to a chicken? But you’re due to wake
up in lOsecs., Ned. You must ’a’ bin missed
long afore this; ’n’ presently the ’ole <asy-
lum ’ll be pounding up Pepper-lane, with the
straight-weskit ’n’ the handcart, t’ restore
you to doo control in Ward 7.”
“John Corum’s mine,” said the other
coolly. “ ’N’ don’t you fret about cats in
my cra-ni-um. I’m one what knows. See?
PATHETIC.

“’N’ get somethin' 'ard ez accessory afore

A couple of minutes later came Mitty
Smith, hatted and ready for the fray, fol-
lowed by the bridesmaids. John Corum took
the bride-elect on his arm, and the wedding
party rattled down the back stairs. As they
did so, Ogden, Esq., came roaring up the
front, and in lOsecs. the manufacture of
paper bags was going along as briskly as if
marrying and giving in marriage were a
matter of no consequence whatever to the

Spatt’s is really the second joint of this
tale. Boyce’s joint claims priority in chron-
ological order, but a storywriter has power
to decree that the first shall be second, and
/the second first. At Boyce’s joint they re-
tailed floating peas,
tepid pies, turgid cof-
fee, icecream, and
other quick-change re-
freshment. It was
among twelve and a-
half dozen of cracked
cups and the wreckage
of 130 mutton pies
that John Corum in-
formed Letitia Wylie
of her pending fate.
“You gotter marry
me,” said Johno.
Letitia pro-
fessed not to see
it in fe that light.
She wasn’t fas-
cinated with the
chance. “Well, I
just won’t,” she
said, pettishly.
Miss Wylie was
kitchen assistant
and ladies’ and
gentlemen’s help
at Boyce’s. Her
admirers were fre-
quent and free,
and John was not
the pick of the
basket.
“When ’n’
where?” persisted
Mr. Corum, with
the air of a man
who would take
no denials.
“S’pose I gotter
say in me own

“ Cert. ’I g h

fettered choice.”
“I won’t be married in any of ’em,
thanks for nothin’.”
“Good enough ! Half a dollar's worth et

Letitia insisted that she wouldn’t marry
Johno if there wasn’t another man living,
yet at the same time she greatly admired the
thirty-seven-and-sixpenny opal engagement
ring he had given her. She said she did not
love him madly, nay, passionately—that she
would never marry a man whom she could
not adore with sufficient frenzy. She had
already bought the material for her wedding
dress, a white muslin with lilac sprigs, but
she still resisted and still denied. She could
never live with a ginger mo, she said. When
John wanted to buy a beautiful, blue-plush.
bow-legged drawing-room suite for £o is..
Lettie was quite peevish for three days
because her soul yearned for an artistic
maple suite of polished kauri, with split
sheepskin morocco bindings,
Then came the day and the hour, and
Johno Corum waited at the church for
Letitia and her people. At ten minutes after
time the lady had not arrived. Twenty
minutes later there was a notable absence of
the bonny bride. In half an hour this scarcity
had become a crying scandal. J-ohno gave
her another quarter, and as the essential
half was still missing, his proper pride
asserted itself. ~ f
“Blimy, she’s bin kiddin’ me,” he said to
the patient parson. "She’s ducked out, but
don’t you take your things off, Mister ; you
don’t lose your job. There’s goin’ t’ be a
weddin, ’n’ I’m t’ be in it. If I don l t have
a willin’ miss back here in twenty-eight and
a half minutes my name’s, Mud.”
Johno tore out, with a Red Indian yell,
and he had been so infuriated for a space of
a quarter of an hour, and so anxious to
fight something or someone, that the church
was delighted to be rid of him. A very few
moments later, Mr. CorUin shot up on the
top flat of Ogden’s fa&f<py, and made his
rash offer to the female employees.
**• A * *
Preliminaries being explained, we can
haste to the wedding. Johno put his party
on a tram, and well within the time stipu-
lated, he bustled Miss Mitty Smith into the
church. There were quite a number of
people sitting about in the pews, two of
them asleep. Behind the altar rails a
young clergyman, in full regimentals, sat
back, embracing his knees, and gazing medi-
tatively at the ceiling. Before the rails
stood a fair-to-medium maiden lady bedizened
in a beautiful parlor curtain, wearing a large
circular bunch of funeral blossoms in an em-
broidered paper setting, and looking as mucn
like a happy bride as circumstance would
permit.
The young lady supporting the bridal bou-
quet was Miss Letitia Wylie!
For a full minute John Corum stood in
the centre of the complication he had
wrought, with a face like the death mask of
a homicidal idiot.
“Oh, John, what a time you’ve been!”
cried the bride with the prior claim.
The clergyman arose, and shook out his
lingerie. “Shall we proceed with the cere-
mony?” said he.
The company awoke, and bestirred itself.
The bride’s mother put on a now-we-shan’t-
be-lqng expression, and Johno Corum gulped
horribly, and let his eyes float from Letitia
to Mitty, and from Miss Smith back to Miss
Wylie.
"Shall we proceed with the ceremony?”
said the parson in resonant tones.
Johno woke up. “Proceed?” he gasped.
“Jimmie Jee, I got two brides!”
Then an ill-regulated debate broke loos“
in that church. It raged for over 10
minutes. Everybody put his, her. or its
spoke in, but Mitty Smith was chief spokes-
woman, and the* bride’s mother an able
second, with the parson as the most promis-
ing outsider. Johno was the centre of the
disturbance. Miss Wylie struck him in the
face with her bouquet, and indulged in in-
termittent hysterics. Her father, an inter-
esting old gentleman with conions whiskers,
stood on the pews, and hurled hymn-books
and other sacred literature at the bride-
groom. Young Mr. Wylie, who tore oysters
asunder in a city saloon, took his coat off.
appointed the clergyman referee and official
time-keener, and was noisily insisting on
Corum fighting him nine rounds, prize-ring
rules. The clergyman sent for a constable.
“He brought me ’ere t’ marry me,” shrilled
Mitty Smith, “ ’n’ he’s goin’ t’ do it.” She


had a half-Nelson on Johno, and there was
a look of deathless resolve in her eye.
Wylie, junior, thrust his fishy left into
Corum’s face with an upward tilt, and said :
“You gotter marry me sister, or the morgue’s
yer only ’ome.”
The clergyman sent for another constable.
The clamor was at its height, and hostili-
ties were on the point of opening up, Johno
having obliged young Mr. Wylie to the ex-
tent of removing three articles of wearing
apparel, when a diversion was created by
the violent intrusion of a large, toil-stained
man in a leather apron.
The new-comer was a farrier, and fresh
from the forge. He pounded into the church,
fury in his air, and a half-pound hammer
in his left hand.
“Stop the weddin’!” he cried. He
ploughed through the crowd, faced the woe-
ful clergyman, and hammering on the altar-
rails, thundered : “I forbid the banns! D’
ye hear? I forbid the banns.” Then he
turned on the hapny party. “Where’s the
bridegroom?” he said. “Show him to me.
This ain’t his weddin’. This is his finish.”
Mitty Smith detached herself from Corum,
and put the grip on the new-comer. “Now,
you just behave, Nicko Jimm,” she cried.
“Fine cheek you’ve got interruptin’ peoples’
weddin’s. You come over ’ere, ’n’ I’ll talk
to you.”
She dragged Nicko Jimm into a far, dim
corner of the church.
“Now, ’ow is it?” growled Jimm. “’Ere’s
Kittie Coudry comes tearin’ t’ me et the
smithy with a dilly mag about you marryin’
another bloke. I ain’t the man t’ stand it,
see.”
“No, and you ain’t the man t’ up ’n’
marry a girl yerself. Give’s a show. You
won’t marry me yerself, V when I got a
willin’ lad, you butt in queerin’ every-
thing.”
“I’ll marry yer, Mit. I will, s’elp me.
I’ll marry yer termorrer,” pleaded the smith.
“Call this off ’n’ mine’s yours.”
“That’s fair dinkum? Very well, then.”
Mitty Smith marched back to the wedding
party. “It’s all right, Wliat’s-yer-name,”
she said. “You can push ahead with your
marryin'. I’m off it. I got another' en-
gagement.”
Mitty Smith sailed out on the arm of her
blackened beau, and, order being restored,
the Corum-Wylie event was duly celebrated.
EDWARD DYSON.
The City of the Last Drink.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
BY the old Moulmein pagoda, that looks
westward up a river, factory chim-
neys smoke, and the White Man talks
teak and paddy.
In his office bungalow, a whisky keg at
his elbow, surrounded by clerks and coolies,
he tabulates logs, meditates over brands,
broods over grievances, and devotes his mind
to the knotty problem of the last stolen ele-
phant.
For him the world that bears no brand,
and is not wooden, has no existence. “Un-
rest” in India, threatened trouble between
China and Japan, the future of the white
race—in such trifles he takes no interest
whatsoever.
“Those Shans,” he says, wearily, “denied
at first that our elephant had any brand.
The Judge ordered the jury to see for itself.
The foreman wanted the elephant brought
into court. Our brand was as plain as a
pagoda. ‘lt was born with that,’ said the
thief. The case has been remanded for an- v
other month, and my leave’s due.”
He mops his brow. Native evidence
makes him very tired. Teak is a tough
thing to chew, and the elephant lies heavily
on his chest.
We paddle up the Salween —a broad, grey
river—among islands with cotton and cocoa-
nut groves, along banks lined with chim-
neys, wharves and warehouses. It is a pictur-
esque scene, where thatch-roofed villages
peep beneath palm-trees; and, despite the
dry season, the vegetation is green and
vivid, and creeks rush down from the pa-
goda-studded hills.
At Moulmein meet four big rivers—the
Attaran, Gyaing, Tahton, aud Salween—all,
like the muckle-mouthed Irrawaddy, flowing
into the Gulf of Martaban.
There is constant life on the rivers. Float
by timber rafts of bamboo, completing their
three or four years’ journey from up-coun-
try ; canoe-shaped boats or “dug-outs” made
out of a teak log; sampans propelled by long
oars; boats hooded with bamboo matting,
laden with paddy, fruits, or green stuff for
elephants; junks with square-cut sails;
river boats, timber boats, barges, and steam
launches churning the water with their
paddles, and belching black smoke.
At a wharf, made out of an old boat, a
quaint crowd collects. A yellow-robed
Buddhist priest holds up a white umbrella.
Children crowd the rafts and splash in the
water. Black-haired Burmese women, natty
and gay, bring down baskets of fruit while
some goods are being unloaded. Everybody
has plenty of time. Behind lies the Burmese
village, with its bamboo houses, many raised
on piles, its blindingly-white pagodas, drows-
ing under the betel palms.
On the right rise high-peaked hills. We
pass cactus-matted islands, banana planta-
tions, bamboo groves, cocoanut palms rising
above the young sugar-cane.
At ICadoe, an important timber station,
there are logs and elephants. Under a shed,
raised on account of the damp, a tusker
rests, piling green leaves on his head. Others
are working—slow, grotesque, but lovable
beasts piling teak, carrying huge logs with
their tusks, and placing them mathemati-
cally into position.
The elephant is the retriever of Burma,
i'lome say he is all bulk and no brain, a
greatly over-rated animal. Others lie in-
abo"t his uncanny sagacity.
Mild. remarked a man who had lived
among elephants for 20 years. “Sometimes
I have seen him go into convulsions at the
sight of a rat. Yes, and I’ve seen the same
tusker march into camp dangling a man s
le°- in his trunk. I think he needed salt, so
ate the mahout. You must always give
elephants enough salt.” . . .
Back at the club the white-clad sahibs
are knocking billiard balls about. Many
Englishmen, who are usually Scotsmen, are
taking their last drink before departing on
leave to Glasgow or Aberdeen, for Moulmein
is on the edge of civilisation; others, just
returned from leave, are taking their last
drink before setting out timber-getting up-
country, for Mouldigid is nlso on tliG of
the jungle.
Moulmein is a cross-road between the
Wild and the Strand —the meeting place
where everybody takes his last drink.
Indeed, there is little else to do; and it is
only in such places that one can learn what
a resplendent institution the Brixton Em-
pire really is.
The multitude of cheap servants corrupt
the sahib, who largely over-estimates his
own importance in the scheme of things;
the damp and laziness sap his strength and
soften his brain.
Many go out to work the teak forests,
others to see that they are not worked over-
much, an arrangement of little economic
value to Burma, but for which, neverthe-
less, was this lazy land annexed.
Few white men care for the country or
wish to settle in it. They come but to make
money. Some save it, more spend it. And
a few years unfits the majority for work
anywhere else.
The pivot of life—the Gospel and the Law
—becomes the bottle. Veterans favor brandy
for chota hazri. A bottle of whisky a day
is a moderate average ; and unless one can
stand up to at least half a bottle daily, one
rapiaiy acquires an unenviable reputation
for weak-mindedness or cheap eccentricity.
Everybody dresseS for dinner. When his
dinner-jacket is off the typical English gentle-
man risks mental and moral degeneration.
Luckily, he usually persists in dressing even
when in the jungle, alone, and surrounded
by tigers. It is his sole moral support.
But the Burman doesn’t worry. Fellow-
subject or no, he steadfastly refuses to be
beguiled by any doctrine of work or of the
glory of Empire-building. Pie wouldn’t
build his own hen-roost if he could help it.
He prefers to smile, to stick a flower in his
hair, to puff a white cheroot half a yard
long—it is mostly paper and gives forth a
sad, depressing odor; to chew a junk of betel
nut, and to sit all day long under a palm-

tree, watching a cockfight or the world going
round. The women, who enjoy consider-
able freedom for Asiatics, have business acu-
men, and attend to the work in the bazars.
Scrupulously neat in attire, always smoking
and smiling, gay in manner, most travellers
regard the Burmese as perhaps the most
charming of Asiatic women. They are not
the handsomest, but they are chic. They
know how to manage a stall, a bungalow, or
a husband. "If the women had been
the men,” states an authority, “Britain
would never have taken Burma.”
In Moulmein the Burma n allows other
Asiatics to do the work. The coolies are
usually Oorias, from the Orissa coast, or
Tamils from Southern India. Chittagonians
form the bulk of the boatmen, elephant ma-
houts and the headmen of coolies. Sikhs
and Afghans make up the military police,
and natives of Oudh. known as Poorbias,
act as watchmen. Sleek Bengalis come from
Calcutta to deal in timber and paddy; and
everywhere, as throughout India, the money-
lending Marwarris batten on the workers
and ekact their cent, per cent. John China-
man, the übiquitous, the eternal, now smokes
his pipe in many a dragon-decorated store,
behind his ancient smile and colored lan-
terns. He is spreading all over Asia, and
everywhere else, and is the problem of the
future. Among the small traders, hawkers
with baskets, are Slians and Laos from
Northern Siam and Monds from the South.
The carrying trade between Burma and
Siam is done mostly by Panthes, mule cara-
vans being used after leaving the cart-roads.
It is all curiously mixed, and the smells
are of many colors,' and plague and cholera
are prevalent. The white-clad, white-
cheeked Empire-builder, weakened by fever,
weary and washed-out, gazes through the
straw in his glass, and vaguely wonders
why he has brought it all about.
“One more drink,” cries the man going
Home.
' “My last,” calls out he who is starting
for the jungle.
And the last drink is very long.
Near midnight, along the Strand, whither
one goes to catch whatever breeze there may
be, a sahib, in evening dress, attended by
his “boy,” reclines like a sleeping Buddha.
His head is down, the “boy” trying in vain
to raise him. He has had his last drink.
At last he looks up and blinks.
“B’y,” he calls softly.
“Sahib,” replies the faithful bearer.
“ Bu-butti Ko bu-budjou” (“Put out the
light”).
Then the Empire-builder puffs out his
cheeks and breathes hard.
He is trying to blow out the moon.
LOUIS ESSON.
The Whale’s Baby.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
I to be a party to this story, but
that need not matter, because William
Tennant, sometime harpooner-in-chief of
the whaling brig Rampager (Captain Aaron
Macintosh), who related the circumstances,
personally guarantees their accuracy. This
is near enough to the way William spun the
yarn to me.
“We had three or four make-shift stations
along the Maoriland coast, with headquarters
at Tokonui, between the Bluff and Waikawa.
Well, one fine day when we had the boats
away out of there on the tail of a school of
sperms, we separated a bull, cow and calf,
and ran them close in to the mouth of the
Tokonui river. The cow was killed without
much trouble, but the bull played up blue
hell before they settled him; and in the
middle of the infernal scuffle the calf was
washed over the bar and became a prisoner.”
Here William wet his whistle —at my ex-
pense.
“Yes. Well, the next thins? was to know
what to do with the blessed kid, for nobody
had the heart to kill it. Howsomever, there
seemed nothing else for it, seein’ as the
mother what used to feed it was no more, as
you might say; when the old man says:
What’s the matter with bringin’ the young-
ster up on the bottle?’ ’Natcherly, what the
old man suggested was good enough to try,
so we drove the baby up on to the beach, arid
put a bellyful of goat’s milk down his gullet.
At first go off he didn't take kindly to the
business,, but in a fiew days he grew used to
it, and lined up regular to the staging every
morning as soon as the sun heaved its anchor
up, and every evening at two-bells. Then
the cook used to drive a she-goat down,

ball): “ Mod' ’strornary thing Pm here—

milk it while the whale pup waited, and do
the feedin’ out of a square-face.”
At this point William whistled that it
was dry work.
“Yes. And the old she-nanny soon began
to take a motherly interest in the proceed-
ings ; and, by-’n-bye, when she felt lonely-
like, she used to go down to the staging
and bleat for her fambly; and no matter
where the fambly was it always came lar-
rupin’ along. Well, to make a long story
short, the two became so attached to one
another that the goat would jump on the
whale’s back on fine afternoons and ride far
out to sea —for by this time we had deepened
the channel to let our friend have some free-
dom —and I never saw her come home with
even her toe-nails wet. Sometimes the cook
would tie a bundle of grass on the whale’s
back when the pair was goin’ one of these ex-
cursions, and then the two of them would go
off for the whole day round Stewart Island
or somewhere. And there was more ’n plea-
sure in it for us. I tell you it was the best
bloomin’ day’s work w T e ever did when we
saved that there young whale’s life. For
why? Because he used to go round amongst
the schools outside, and tell ’em what sort of
a good place he had got on to, and they used
to come up the channel in strings to have a
squint round, which was the end of ’em.
There wasn’t a one of us didn’t make a for-
tune down there, and”
But I didn't wait for the rest. I was
afraid I might begin to doubt William if I
heard any more, and I’d hate to do that.

BY Camden town a lilac grows,
And in its shade a tall moss rose
Bends softly down;
As if slie longed again to see,
The English red-coats marching free
Through Camden town.
Methinks I hear the lilac sigh,
Those old Colonial days gone by,
When, o’er the brown
Wheat paddocks, in the pleasant morn
The reapers went to cut the corn,
By Camden town.
That old moss rose, within her dreams,
May glimpse high-laden bullock teams
Outside “The Crown,”
While on a sanded floor within
Wild teamsters drank the New Year in
At Camden town;
And in that past doth dimly see
A district belle, in dimity,
Uplift her gown,
To shake from high, old-fashioned heels,
The dust of ancient carriage wheels
In Camden town.
Now ay de mi! So low she lies
In that old churchyard on the rise.
Nor smile nor frown
That early Beauty courts or fears;
She takes her rest these fifty years,

My grandsire, in that long-dead day,
She wed a clown
For wealth and place...He, long ago,.
To want and sorrow brought her low

Her name is wearing from the stone
By rose and lilac overgrown;
No far renown
Attaches to the actors three
In this forgotten tragedy
Of Camden town.
But down a red road, as the horn
Of some gay motor wakes the morn,
With ghostly frown,
The spirit of an old romance
Turns sadly in its grave, perchance,

A Song of the Air.
/ J r '7lE liner drives with her sunken
A blades —
The mail with her whirling wheels ..
That fly the levels and leap the grades,
And roar where a tall bridge reels.
Yet they are slow as the tides are slow
In the race with the ocean wind.
We watch them hurrying far beloiv,
And ipe leave them far behind.
As we lift and soar on the planes that cry
With the strain of the awful speed.
We are the lords of the upper sky,
Oh, little eartn men, give heed!
The sun sinks red to the westward,
A blue haze spreads below,
While eastward and south there shimmers
The golden after-glow.
With glorious space above us,
Around us the twilight fades
In a silence only broken
r By the swift propeller blades.
Then stars come out of their day-dreams,
Shining, some timid, some full,
And white, on the mists reflecting,
The lights of our long, lean hull.
Onward at speed that reckons
By hours where we told by days,
On the tortuous earthen railways,
And the wild, slow ocean ways.
There are lights to the port and starboard
And a great, white glare far down,
Where, girt by her bays, half-lolling,
Dreams wondrous Sydney town.
Our strong vibrator quivers
Its warning across the night—
The call of the fast mail-flyer,
And the lights swerve left and right.
Inward, from San Francisco,
A long, white ship sweeps by,
A bell on her bridge-deck tolling
Lone notes to a lonely sky.
And, dropping down to her moorings,
The Indian liner swings,
Ablaze like a clasp of jewels,
Made for a line of kings.
So the lights pass on and darken,
And only the bright stars shine,
As we leap full-speed to eastward,
The fastest ship of the line.
With Ocean a mile below us,
r Wrapped in her cloak of grey,
The world-winds, passing, whimper
At the ship that thwarts their sway.
And, held in the hull, there mutters
The god of the wild machine
That drives us, quivering, swaying,
Where only the gods have been.
Watch after watch, Night wearies—-
Dawn sees us floating down
To the silvery, gleaming water
That dreams by Auckland Town.
The liner drives with her head to sea,
And her icild screws kicking high.
The fast express ivas an extasy
At night , in the years gone by.
But these be slow and tardy things,
And scorned by the men who fly
On ships that rise on poised wings,
And beat their hearts in the sky.
Lifting up on the planes that moan
With the strain of the awful speed.
We are the lords of the higher zone,
Oh, men of the earth, take heed!

THE CODE MESSAGES.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
PUKETAPU Junction was an idle sta-
tion, but the presence of a telegraph
instrument in the office kept the un-
fortunate officer tied up like a dog on a
chain —he could never go out of earshot. I
was the unfortunate officer, and now I am
out of it, J earnestly advise the management
of Maoriland Railways to find work for
young officers to do, for the old truism about
Satan and idle hands is one of the few
truisms that are true.
The afternoons were long at Puketapu, and
mostly I sat in a deck-chair, and read any
stray literature that happened along, and
smoked the correct thing of the hour in cigar-
ettes. But ever my heart was out where the
top of Puketapu showed grey against the
cloud-flecked sky, and down by the old
lagoon where the wild duck flew, and the
flounders cavorted round the estuary.
OUT FOR A SPIN.
MOTORIST: “What did you say you dropped?"
CHAUFFEUR: “Only a topper."
The telegraph wire that passed through
our office was a busy one —seldom silent, in
fact —and sometimes, in sheer desperation for
something to do, I would sit on the deck-
chair and read the messages that went click-
ing through, but as on most days, they all
had reference to the workiu<r 0 f the line,
they were not very interesting. They dealt
with the movements of trucks and the running
of ballast trains, and so forth. But I got
into a habit of reading them mechanically.
It used to rain sometimes at Puketapu
Junction, and on wet afternoons, even if it
was midsummer, I used to make a disgusted
porter light a fire —it cheered things up
somewhat. One afternoon, while it was
raining, and I loafed by the fire, I was
rather astonished to hear a message in
cipher from the Central Goldfields wire,
which was not our wire, break out on the
office sounder. Of course it was a case of
wires crossed or something, and then I re-
membered that morning young Billy Smith
had been trying to fly a kite along the plat-
form.
I called porter John Reid, and, assuming
an air of vast wisdom, said gravely :
“Jacko, go out and cast your glittering eye
along the wires by the post at the back of
the office, and tell me is there a kite tail
caught.”
Porter John Reid returned in two min-
utes with his mouth open.
“There is, by gosh ! Now, how the devil
did you know, ’cos’ it’s only 20 minutes or
so that it got properly tangled.”
I made no reply, but went out and looked
at those- wfires. I wanted to make sure
which was the Goldfields wire. Desire of
knowledge—out-of-the-way, apparently-use-
less infoi’mation- —has always been a charac-
teristic of our family.
* . * * *
Bulger was the postmaster, and his office
was located at the other end of the town.
He was great on codes and ciphers, and used
to boast that he had once been employed in
the British Post Office to translate cipher
letters of suspected personages. Nobody be-
lieved this yarn, because everybody knew
that no British Government would dream
of opening anybody’s letters —England is the
home of the free, and the fortress of Indi-
vidual Right. Nevertheless, he might know
something about codes.
So I sounded Bulger cautiously, and, after
I had circumnavigated the bush for half an
hour or so. Bul-
ger filled his
pipe with a se-
vere expression
in his eye, and
came to the
point suddenly:
“L o o k here,
old man, what’s
in your noddle?
I know you’ve
got some vil-
lainy ferment-
ing there, so out
with it, and, if
it isn’t too dan-
gerous, and the
splosh is at all
c erta i n, I’m
your Moses !”
“I’ve found
out which i s
the Goldfields
wire!”
“Well, what of
that ? I could
have told you
had I known
you were inter-
ested.”
“Yes, but I’ve
found out how
to tar it,
and, as you know all about ciphers, I thought
we might collar Leslie Bluenose’s telegrams
to his city manager, follow his lead, and get
fat.”
“Walls have ears!” said Bulger, walking
to the door hastily, and looking down the
passage cautiously.
“It’s all right,” he said, coming back,
“but we will finish this conversation out
under the stars. - Come along !”
When we were clear of the little town
Bulger went on :
“Don’t see how you’re going to tap it
without being traced. If you sling it on to
your office instrument everyone on the wire
will know something is crooked; and you
can’t tap it without a sounder.”
“I’ve got a sounder of my own ; the water-
tap will do for ‘earth,’ and I’ll put an extra
station on their blessed Goldfields wire.”
“Where will you stow it? You can’t have
an unauthorised instrument on the office
table. First electrician that comes along
will say ‘Whaffor?’ and then you’re in the
mud. No, it’s too dangerous.”
“Will you translate the messages if I
catch them?”
“You bet your blooming life; but, for
Heaven’s sake, be careful. They’d sack you
if they bowled you out.”
“Well, I believe they would play up. It
isn’t quite the same as reading a message
which goes through your own office. It’s a
case of tampering with Her Majesty’s tele-
graph lines to acquire other people’s mes-
sages. But I’ll risk it.”
Then we walked back, and I set to work
to add an unauthorised telegraph station to
the Central Goldfields line. It took two
hours of hard work, some climbing, and con-
siderable brain-fag to make that connection ;
but when it was done I felt proud of my-
self.
I had screwed the sounder, upside down,
with a compensating adjustment, to the bot-
tom of the table on which stood the railway
instrument. Under no conditions would
that table be moved, and the presence of the
extra wires on the edge of it did not excite
suspicion. I had fixed it so that a touch
with the thumb would disconnect the sounder
and cut the unauthorised station out of the
circuit, without interfering with the main
line in any way. Then we shut the door,
and while Bulger sat on the end of the table
and smoked, I sat in the deck-chair and took
a number of messages. The only one which
really interested us was the following:—
Shark,
Romahapa.
Menthorne C. Cabbage, apple, i turnip, peach.
Golden Hope—l- spud, plum, peach. Mokonui —
banana orange 5/Bths, artichoke 2.
(Signed) BLUENOSE.
* * * *
Our combined capital was £BO, and so
wonderful a speculator was Bluenose that in
16 weeks we had turned our £BO into £450,
and were going strong. What puzzled Blue-
nose was that a rival firm, Gray, Nurse and
Co., used, at first in a small way, but in a
way that grew week by week, to anticipate
his instructions to his manager. The worst
of it was that when Gray, Nurse and Co.
found that our lead usually led to fair divi-
dends and practically ho losses, they started
to follow it on their own account, and Blue-
nose got very wild.
He rushed to the Director of Telegraphs
and swore there was a leak, and demanded
that somebody should be hung. The officer,
who was accustomed to that sort of thing,
set various traps, but, as there was no
sender on our apparatus, and it was a re-
ceiving station only, all his tricks failed to
locate it. Meanwhile our swag swelled up
from £450 to £7OO odd.
Leslie Bluenose changed his code, and the
mysterious operations stopped with a bang
for a fortnight, during which time Bulger
made frantic efforts to decipher the new
code. I’m sorry to say that Bulger had
developed into a most confirmed money-grub.
Leslie Bluenose beamed. He stayed one
night at the pub where I lived, and
told me all about it, and asked me if I
could suggest how it was done. I told him
I didn’t believe it could be done —in fact, it
was just a fanciful idea born in his brilliant
imagination—which sort of brilliant imag-
ination, by the way, is often responsible for
the impossible of to-day being the matter of
fact of to-morrow.
Leslie Bluenose looked at me keenly, and
then called for drinks. When he put down
his glass he said decisively:—
“Your blasted blarney doesn’t deceive me
a bit. I’ve been taking a course in ‘Elec-
tricity as applied to the transmission of Sig-
nals’ lately, and I know it can be done;
and I know that you know it can be done;
an’, damme, if I don’t think you know some-
thing about it.”
* * * *
Then Bulger translated the cipher, and
Bluenose’s troubles resumed on a larger
scale than ever. He became wildly furious,
and assaulted both the head men of Gray,
Nurse and Co., on the floor of the Stock
Exchange.
Meanwhile I imported the best thing in
the bicycle line that England produced. 1
laid in a stock of seven suits, and wore a
different one every day. Likewise boots.
The girls at the hotel said my pyjamas were
a dream, and I held a beauty show, gave
the fair competitors a supper, and presented
the three pi’ettiest with valuable prizes, and
some kisses.
An auditor —no less a personage than The
Raven himself—descended on the station
suddenly, and overhauled my accounts un-
mercifully. But, instead of finding a short-
age, he discovered that I had 10s. too much.
He stayed with me nearly a week, and then
I was fined for having a surplus in the till.
When I asked the brute to have a cham-
pagne lunch with me he declined coldly, and
informed me in the baldest manner that I
was an object of suspicion, and that my
vagaries had been brought under the notice
of the Head Ottice.
There was nothing for it but to brazen it
out, and I had some more elegant suits made
for summer wear, and subscribed to the funds
of the Anglican and Presbyterian churches,
with which all the “best people” were con-
nected.
I had just sat down one dreamy summer
afternoon to take Bluenose’s message, when
the aroma of a most delicious cigar sud-
denly floated into the office. I had smelt that
cigar before; it was the preliminary and in-
visible sign of the presence of the Old Man.
So I disconnected the instrument with the
toe of my boot, and was in a deep reverie
with one knee crossed over the other, and my
arms under my head when the Old Man fol-
lowed the aroma of his cigar.
He Was dressed in a swallow-tail coat of
pale-blue corded worsted. His vest was a
delightful creation of cream silk and pale-
blue spots, fastened with a couple of onyx
buttons. The satin tie and regatta shirt
were hidden by the silvery, silky beard that
hung down from his beautiful pink and
white face. His trousers were of the tiny
check known as shepherd’s tartan, and over
his resplendently polished porpoise-hide
boots he wore cream spats to match his
vest. His umbrella was gold mounted.
He nodded and walked straight into the
station-master’s office.
“He’s not in, Mr. Mackenzie!”
“Humph ! Chuck it!”
“Chuck what, sirV”
“There’s nothing in it.”
“I don’t understand —there’s nothing in
what?”
“Is he in it, too?” and he jerked his head
towards the S.M.’s room.
“No, sir; didn’t you notice his room was
empty!”
“So will your billet be presently, if you
play the fool with me. How much have you
made out of it?”
“I don’t understand—not very much !”
“I didn’t think so. Well, have you got
£lO about you? I find I’ve come away and
left myself a bit short.”
“Look here, I can’t give you £lO on the
hop. This is a syndicate, and I'll have to
get the money from them.”
“Oh, it’s a syndicate, is it? Well, in that
case, I’ll take £2O. And then I think you’d
better chuck it for a bit. Next time you
strike a good venture, let ME know, an’
we’ll raise some capital. Bluenose came
round and said the Post Ottice people had
come to the conclusion it was some railwaj
scamp, and I thought of you immediately,
so I came up and tried bluff. I didn’t think
you’d have caved so easily.”
“Well, you might have looked under the
table.”
He dropped the cushion out of the S.M.’s
chair on to the floor, got down and looked
under the table. Then he hoisted himself
up, breathed hard, and remarked as he placed
a cigar in my hand.
“Most ingenious, most ingenious! You’ll
be in gaol yet. Well, I’ll go now —you won't
forget that £5O, first thing in the morning,
will you?”
Just then the S.M. arrived, and I rushed
the old reprobate of a manager over to where
there was a pretty barmaid. It would be
£lOO soon, if I couldn’t side-track him.
Then he went back to Romahapa with the
£5O in his vest pocket, and reported to Head
Office that he was pained that the General
Manager should listen to these aspersions
on his staff. His officers were gentlemen of
honor, and he suggested that the Department
should call on these confidential detractors
to either make good their charges or face an
action for libel in the Supreme Court.
That broke Leslie Bluenose right up, and
he started to play it low down. He sent a
fake wire, a lying telegram, ordering his
manager to pawn everything, beg and bor-
row all the money he could, and buy Golden
Hopes. Mrs. Bluenose was also wired to
hypothecate her jewellery, and give the
money to the manager to invest in Golden
Hopes.
We fell over ourselves to turn everything
into money with which to buy Golden Hopes.
Fortunately, we hadn’t much luck. The mar-
ket was sick, money was tight, and we had
only dropped about £3OO when we discovered
that Leslie Bluenose himself was selling us
Golden Hopes, and that we were beng fooled.
How much we were fooled we realised when,
that night, it was reported that the inrush
of water had wrecked the mine, and des-
troyed the machinery. Later on, another
wire stated that the shaft had collapsed, and
the Golden Hope Co. would go into recon-
struction, but ttiat there wasn’t much to re-
construct.
Next morning, Leslie Bluenose, fleeing
from the flooded goldfield, looked in, with
his face beaming, at the office door, and took
a lunar at me. He never said a word, just
smiled, lunared, and was gone before the ruler
hit the door.
* * * *
That night we held a board meeting, and
decided to wind up the co. In spite of all
losses there was a sum of £3OO for each of
us, after losing the money invested in Golden
Hopes and the £5O “lent” to the manager.
The unauthorised station disappeared from
the Central Goldfields circuit.

Merryman Pan.
LET me lilt you a lay of a minstrel gay,
Who was wandering, wild and free,
When he came to a glade by the
fairies made,
In the shade of the greenwood tree.
There he threw him down where the brackens
brown
Were tipped with a touch of gold,
With the beech and the larch an enchanted
arch
High over his head to hold.
Then his strings he felt with a hand that
dwelt
On a note, and a chord, and a strain ;
For his soul was a-dream in the twilight
gleam,
And a-tune to the wood’s refrain.
He sang as he played, till the woodland
shade
With his melody fair was filled ;
And the song that he breathed with the
flowers enwreathed,
And the trees with its wonder thrilled.
Then the thrush and the wren and the wild
moor-hen,
And the stork and the starling, too,
And the owl and the bat and the water-rat,
And the hawk and the great sea-mew,
They came in flocks, from the trees and
rocks,
And the plains and the hills and the sea;
They came enthralled by a tone that called
To the heart that in each must be;
They sat them around in that ring of sound
That was more than a mortal song;
But the minstrel’s gaze was on far-off ways,
And he knew nor the thrall nor the throng.
But the strings he swept with a hand that
leapt
From the croon of a crone, to a cry
I.ike the shriek of death through the
strangled breath,
In the storm where the wild things die ;
From the trump of fate, to the call of a mate,
To the mate that he seeks for his own;
From the soft love note in the ringdove’s
throat
To the were-wolf’s hungry moan.
Then the darkness fell, and the passing-bell
Was heard from the tower on the hill ;
Then a wondrous peace, as the wild notes
cease;
And the minstx-el strange lies still.

Reminiscence.
WE are proud of our mind’s achieve-
ment,
And proud of our body’s shape;
But back in the past, says Science,
We were ox and wolf and ape.
We browsed on the primal herbage,
Or swung in a forest grey,
Or, nose to moon, through the midnight,
We hunted our stricken prey.
We knew not the past behind us,
Or the wonderful crown in front;
For the work of our day was ever
To browse and clamber and hunt.
So long as the grass was luscious,
So long as the nuts hung near,
So long as our jaws were reddened,
We had never a hope or fear.
It was all so animal . . . brutish.
And we are so noble . . . good—
"We could surely never have ravened
Or browsed, or climbed in the wood.
And yet, it is mine to fancy
(As yours it may be to scout)
Whenever the ox took courage
The Man through his eyes looked out.
Whenever the wolf grew kindly,
And paused as he ravening ran.
Somewhere in his blood there kindled
The promise and pledge of Man.
And to follow the fancy further —
Whenever some old ape heard
A song in the trees, and hearkened,
The Man in his being stirred.
We are proud of our mind’s achievement,
And proud of our body’s shape;
But what of the ox within us,
And what of the wolf and ape?
On the brow of the beaten toiler,
In the depths of his eyes unlit,
On his shoulders, bowed with service,
The sign of the ox is writ.
In the smile of the gilded sweater,
Who battens on human lives,
And turns red blood to coinage,
The wolf of the wild survives.
And. at times, as I watch the antics
Of some spoiled son of ease,
I think of a primal forest
And an ape among the trees.

A Moon-Dream.
THE wind was dead, the sand lay calm
in the blaze;
The moon swung low at anchor across
the haze;
Bells on the harness sang to their elfs’
own rune;
The serried caravans set out for the Moon.
Two by two the horses outscreamed from
sight,
Drawing with easy wheels, for their load
was light,
And little black slaves, with ripple of bronze
and jade,
Danced in the sand of the channels the
wheels had made.
The serried caravans moved to the windless
plain,
And the sombre voices, low with long-welling
pain,
Of the white-robed Wise, still sought them,
outcrying rain!
Wliat man, like forming cloud, to the height
is driven,
Or Moon, from the laden sky, to the earth
like rain?
Ye pace a phantom path to the wastes of
Heaven,
And pace. .. .in vain.
There came the maid they chose as Bride-of-
the-Moon :
Her doom-black eyes were lidded against the
noon:
The moon-shaped scar on her breast to the
blaze was bare:
There were pearls like streaming bees in her
beaded hair;
I saw her turn, as she passed, to deride the
Wise :
But she could not hide the fear in her
haunted eyes.
Over the chant of the Wise her clear-belled
song
Swept like a desert-wind through the host
along:
Out from the starry main to the sanded
shore
The Moon, my love, returns to the Earth
once more:
Sinks not the sphere to its source when the
planets wane?
The Son of the Earth to the Earth is re-
turned again!
Ah, she sang as they sang of old by the
cedar-tires,
The forest-haunted, chanting to netted lyres,
When stars from the boughs, too rich, of the
burdening sky, were spilled,
And all Night’s shades and ways with stain
of the moonray filled;
And none there heeded the Wise when she
sang—their eyes
Gazed to the waiting Moon in the windless
skies ;
Bells on the harness rippled in elfin rune:
The serried Caravans set out for the Moon.
I saw the Caravans set out for the Moon ;
There was Fear like Night on the eyes in
the hoods at noon :
I saw the maid they chose as a Moon-bride
fair :
There were pearls-of-the-moon like bees in
her beaded hair,
I watched her turn, as she passed, to deride
the Wise:
But she could not hide the fear in her
haunted eyes.

Helen’s Bower.
THE balcony where Helen bides
Is hung above the river bend ;
Thither the stealthy waters wend
To whisper with the lifting tides.
About her slender railing clings
And climbs a many-branching rose
That all in crimson buds and blows,
And wafteth fragrant summonings.
When evening on the river lies,
The hollow ripples hold a light
As of reflection, darkly bright,
From downward-looking shadow eyes;
But when my boat, with silver wake,
Stirs the clear shadow gathered there,
I see not Helen anywhere,
And all the hollows spill and break.
I’ve paid the ancient sorcerer
My soul —he will not take my gold—
And he hath sworn that I shall hold
The living, breathing grace of her.
To lift that evil-weighted spell
Sir Priest hath wrestled long. Saith he:
“Beneath yon rose-bright balcony,
Oh, Fool, thou driftest quick to Hell!
“Look you. ’tis but a dream,” he saith —
But such a dream as well might make
The proudest monarch fear to wake.
Wherefore I still draw even breath,
And bid my heart lie close, lie close.
Small need to paint me fires of Hell;
Me, that must burn unquenchable
When Helen goes—when Helen goes!

No Matter.
THERE’S a tarnished little
bauble on my topmost
mental shelf,
Which longtime on my breast I bravely
daunted :
Though I gazed in many mirrors I could
never see myself,
And my faith in my illusion was un-
daunted.
One’s bauble of Importance shines as bright
as virgin gold :
In youth we never notice that the gilt is
merely “rolled” ;
Our vanity persistently we flatter
Till Truth appears and whispers in an ear
that’s growing old,
And the liearkener is told he doesn’t mat-
ter.
’Twixt a leading politician and a dead-beat
on the tramp
The difference is simply a distinction,
In the eyes of the nude lady who upholds a
classic lamp,
Or of Death, who dooms all mortals to
extinction.
The politician figures as a hero of to-day
When he blathers to the masses who vocifer-
ate “Hooray !”
Or “Bunkum!” as they listen to his chat-
ter.
He’s a person of importance till he passes
right away,
Then it seems his disappearance didn’t
matter.
Rich merchants Dy the dozen I am calling
now to mind
Who have strutted in the mart like Alex-
anders,
The petty, sordid armies of commercial
humankind
Regarded them as wonderful commanders.
The shadow of their fatness falls no longer
on the street:
They died and they were buried, and the
worms will likewise eat
Their successors, who are quite as fat or
fatter.
But wouldn’t these be wounded in their
precious self-conceit,
If you told them their existence doesn’t
matter!
“I could never love another,” says the
maiden to the man:
Her soothing words are seriously spoken;
When she tries to love another she discovers
that she can,
And the heart of him she jilted isn't
broken.
For Nature is a tyrant, and its laws must
be obeyed:
It has no consideration for a subject’s social
grade,
In their early days as well as in their
latter,
The transitory passion of the lover and the
maid
Is found to be a flame that didn’t matter.
I am sick of hearing comments on the mar-
vels of the age,
By persons who delight in up-to-dateness—
Who have watched each new invention to its
very latest stage;
And love the latest fashions for their late-
ness.
The feats of modern science are a worry to
my brain.
Electric innovations seem a very doubtful
gain
To a citizen whose nerves they tend to
shatter.
Sure the fact that Julius Caesar never trav-
elled in a train,
Or telephoned a message, doesn’t matter.
Old Time is still a-flying, and the ages on-
ward roll,
The fruits of life get ripe and soon are
rotten.
This maxim I have treasured, like a miser,
in my soul,
Namely, “Man is mostly born to be for-
gotten.”
Prithee, take whatever’s going, fellow mem-
bers of the crowd.
Enjoy a sense of humor in the presence of
the proud,
Get never quite as mad, as, say, a hatter.
When we’re numbered with the angels we
will sit upon a cloud.
And remember all the things that didn’t
matter.

Rubaiyat of an Average Bloke.
I WAKE, the day has driven forth the
night,
And lo! my sleeping-room is bathed in
light,
And Mary calls without, “’Tis eight o’clock,”
I turn towards the wall and grunt “Or!
right!"
I dream when Dawn’s Left Hand is in the
sky,
And hearken not unto the housemaid’s cry ;
Perhaps I could get up if I desired,
But then I dashed well don’t intend to try !
“How splendid is the early morn,” think
some:
Others : “How fine pre-breakfast walks. Oh,
come
With us,” they say, “at six o’clock a.m.’
I merely look at them, remaining dumb!
For while the shrill cock crows without the
door
Like some old, dull, uninteresting bore,
I lie untidily upon my back
And think: “Old man, you’ve said all that
before.”
I thuswise muse: “How splendid it would be
Could I induce them to bring up to me
A loaf of bread, some butter and a plate,
And —blow the book of verse! —a cup of
tea.”
Alas! the hopes men set their hearts upon
Turn ashes; for without I hear anon
The voice of Mary: “It is ’arf-past
eight”—
Downstairs her slippers pad and she is gone.
I sadly rise. “How early is the hour,”
I think. The sunshine in Life’s eastern
tower
Moves me to brood on my unhappy fate,
What time I shiver ’neath the morning
shower.
Then, like a brazen-throated noth of Doom,
I hear the breakfast gong’s discordant boom ;
Visions of lumpy porridge and tough
steak,
Plunge me into the depths of' hopeless gloom !
Downstairs I rush. The steak is there!
“Oh ! whence
Came this?” I ask. My rage it doth in-
cense.
I clamor for a cup of tea to drown
The Memory of this Impertinence !
Six minutes for my breakfast, then I must
Depart; the Argus in my pocket thrust;
I read it in the train and thus I learn
Of the designs of Sosh, with deep disgust!
And in the carriage, I, as sure as Fate
(This rouses in my breast the lust of Hate)
Will meet a youth, liigh-collared, who in-
quires :
“What do you think of Carlton’s chances,
mate?”
And then begins among those who frequent
My train, a long and heated argument
Anent the chances of the Saints and
“Sowth”;
But I step out as wise as in I went.
I leave the wise to row and wrangle re
The merits of Geelong and ’Varsity.
The clock upon the station striketh nine,
And citywards, in haste, I wildly flee!
Perched high upon a stool all day I sit
Writing in weighty tomes, and having writ,
At six I journey homeward, in a train
And listen to the youth’s depressing wit.
At half-past ten I blink a sleepy eye,
And realise that lam feeling dry—
One glassful of the old juice do I drink,
Then close the cupboard with a heavy sigh!
’Tis time to put the clock outside the door,
Wind up the cat and then retire to snore !
Another day is gone. To-morrow I
If I awake —will do it all some more!

ILONG for stately numbers,
For linked and wedded notes,
Wherein some Idyll slumbers,
Some mystic cadence floats.
On rhythmic sound-waves humming
My soul exultant swims—
I loathe the labored strumming
Of antiquated hymns.
Like some dull, dreary function,
Funereal, they beat
With sanctimonious unction,
Or plod with hobbled feet.
When piety is thumping
They sound, those saintly airs,
Like wooden legs a-stumping
Up endless flights of stairs.
Long cheated of sepulture
The hymnals wail and moan,
As voices, void of culture,
The painful chants intone;
Their woeful bathos surges
In hopeless minor keys—
Sure, no sepulchral dirges
Had gloomier themes than these!
With oily locks and lanky
A zealot once I knew,
Who wailed through yards of Sankey,
And reams of Moody too;
The ecstasy that shook him
Caused me enduring ™ T oe,
Till Nemesis o’ertook him—
I trust he wails below.
Oh, that some force potential
Were given me, to quell
Those plaints so unessential
That cause the gorge to swell;
That doleful exorcising
Of demons of the Text;
That drear apostrophising
With which the soul is vexed.
Sweet melodies we cherish
When to sweet numbers wed.
Go to! and prithee perish,
O Hymns, that should be dead!
Without the least compunction
We would inter thee well,
And ring, with perfect unction.
The ancient Hymnal’s knell !

Gum Leaves on the Fire.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
DAD’S just a bent old cripple now ;
Full eighty winders gone have reared
Their snow-drifts high above his brow
And spilled their frosts down on his beard ;
Blind, too, for in the eyes that blazed
Defiance unto arnffid might
At Ballarat, the years have raised
A misty monument of Night.
He speaks not much, but, like an Age
Within the shadow Time has cast (
Sleeps in his place—a tattered page
Touched with the pathos of the Past.
But sometimes for the old times’ sake
We stir dead embers of desire,
And bid old memories awake
By burning gum-leates on the fire.
The pungent smoke rolls up and spreads
Its aromatic fumes around,
And back through vanished years Dad treads
Like one who walks on holy ground,
Till, as his thoughts the decades span,
He tells us tales of times long gone—
The “I remembers” of a man
Who fought and lost nnd still fought on.
Again Eureka’s voices ring
From blazing bivouacs of night;
Again the rifle oullets sing
Across the palisaded height;
Again we hear the bugle-call
And, where Rafaello’s ardor led,
We watch one fight, and fighting fall
Where Lalor fought and Lalor bled.
Again by mountain-spur and creek
He sits by many a camp-fire’s blaze,
And bearded mates come back and speak
Of golden deeds, of golden days ;
With here the riot of the rush,
The shanty and the gleaming lode,
And there, ah! there, the mournful hush
Of comrades wandered from the road.
Dead comrades ! but the gold of Time
Death washes into History,
And such as Lalor, Burke and Syme
Are wealth for all posterity ;
And these the old man worked beside ;
And these, and such as these, come fast
To show us how the world grew wide
From scattered camp-fires of the past.
But not of men, and not of gold,
And not of bush-ways undefined,
Are all our father’s stories told;
The burning gum-leaves bring to mind
One simple tale of love that glows
With faith and loyalty and truth ;
Then where the swift Campaspe flows
He sings again his song of youth.
Oh! she was glorious ; her smiles
Such magnets strong men might not miss!
He rode at night a hundred miles
To claim at morn, perchance, one kiss.
“And she” —the blind eyes seek the light—
“ She was your mother!” proudly said ;
Then with a broken “Boys, good-night!”
The old man gropes his way to bed.
“Good-niglit! Good-night!” perchance he
dreams,
When the last link of life shall break,
Of wooing on, by radiant streams,
Our mother for her own sweet sake ;
But this we know, who sit alone,
And watch the blinking coals expire—
Dad sits upon a kingly throne
When gum-leaves crackle on the fire.

THE two tried mates—the prospector
and the sailor—went east to Towns-

vilie, and there Jack \V agstaff was
called to Thursday Island, and Crayth went
ALARMING SYMPTOMS.
(At the Pessimists' Club.)

vvith him. And from Torres Strait Wag-
staff was despatched south, as first officer of
a British India steamer laden with jute for
Sydney and Melbourne.
They parted with regrets, Crayth saying
that lie would work at something in the
Straits till the sailor returned. It was no
question of waning mateship, but of the ex-
pediency of making money. Wagstaff was
always short of money. Crayth, so many
times on the threshold of a fortune, whs, as
he phrased it, “up against it” again, and as
he could be neither thief nOr beggar, he must
dig. He watched the Ifidaba, with Jack
Wagstaff aboard, drop behind Goode Island
and make tortuous ways between the reefs
to clear Cape York, and he watched the
Indaba again as she came in sight for a
moment between Horn and Tuesday Islands.
Then he felt his loneliness, and for a moment
was very sorry for himself.
But it was only for a moment. He looked
for work, and found it in an hour as super-
cargo of the Tarawa, tlie storeship of the
biggest pearling fleet in Torres Strait. And
in a fortnight he had settled- down to the
work as if he were born to it.
He looked upon the deck of the storeship
- —a confusion of shell, dead oysters, colored
men and diving gear, the red rubber spi-
ralled tubes that are the diver’s life. The
warm sea was dotted with turqupise-blue
jelly fish, taking their color from the water
which had had its shallowness disturbed by
a big blow. _ Two coffee-colored men pulled,
against the eight-knot tide, a dinghy, so loaded
with stores that only an inch or so of free-
board kept the boat afloat in the fresh little
seas, and the water lapped and hobbled, at
the storesliip’s ladder and anchor chain,
making noises like the lip sounds of a guz-
zling drinker. And Crayth heard the noises,
and was irritated thereby, for he was trying
to think a way out of a tight place. He
held in his hand a telegram, delivered that
day, but dated yesterday from Sydney, 2500
miles south.
“Stranded—wire thirty pounds—before
Saturday^—Jack Wagstaff.”
And he hadn’t 30 pence; and yet the 30
pounds must be found and telegraphed. It
never entered Crayth’s mind to make excuse
or refusal.
“He’s my mate,” said Crayth. “We did
that perish in the lancewoods. He’s my
mate. But where’s the £3O to come from?”
He addressed the gorgeous sunbirds as
they flew between the shining masts of the
schooner, unpainted pine, glossy with oil, and
tapering gracefully to the brown trucks.
Getting no satisfaction from them, he stared
five minutes at the flying fish steeplechasing
from their enemies in the quick, continuous
seas. After that he stared at a Jap car-
penter casing the peai-l-shell and stencilling-
on it the address of a firm in Hatton Gar-
dens, London, and then at the men who
trimmed the shell —-Rotumahs, Javanese, Ke-
wais from New Guinea, Bingliis from Aus-
tralia, and a Nova Scotian. And in-
spiration would not come. Then he
spoke to the white men who opened the
oysters and searched for pearls in the cor-
ruption of the dead oyster.
•‘I want to go up to Thursday,” he said.
“You’ll have to wait the tide,” they told
him.
So he sat down to worry and wait for five
hours, and in the slack water of the after-
noon two Cingalese rowed him up the nar-
row channels, and met a new current at
every point. The indigo of the sky and the
sea was splashed rudely with the brown of
the bare islands, for this was in the south-
west monsoon, and all the life of the soil was
dead.
Crayth felt as dead and despairing as the
bare rocks looked to be —his mate in trouble
far away, and he had but two pounds of the
30 wanted. He went into Denny O’Rourke's
hotel, and ordered a drink, and sat quietly
in the bar smoking.
“Ye seemed troubled,” said Denny
O’Rourke.
“I am —a bit.”
“What’s it about?”
“A- —a —friend ligs wired to me for money,
and I haven’t got it. I wanted to send it to
him. He’s a mate —a friend.”
O’Rourke smiled to himself at the hesita-
tion. “ ’Tis a woman do be the friend,” he
thought, but he said only, “How much?”
“Oh ! I can’t get it —it’s £30.”
“H’m! Thirty pounds is £3O ; but I don’t
like to see a good felly in trouble. I’ll lend
it to ye.”
“You will?”
“Yes, I’ll find it.”
“I don’t know when I can pay you.”
“Oh! pay me when you can.” He had
taken a pen and ink from the shelf and a
crumpled doa-eared cheoue-book from the
till drawer, and proceeded, with many grim-
aces and apparently much agony of spirit,
to write the cheque.
“But,” persisted Crayth, “you don’t know
me well enough.”
“Look here,” said Denny, stopping and
pointing the bitten end of the pen-handle at
him, “I know a man when I see ’im, and
y’ave a good eye, an’ you’ll pay me, I
know.”
So Craytli took the cheque, and thanked
him and said: "lie asked me to wire it
through the post office.”
Denny smiled again at the “he,” but
politely accepted the sex of the needy one,
and advised other procedure.
“Ye’d better send it troo a bank,” he
said, “an’ then ’twill go to the right one
when she’s identified.”
“She! He.”
“Oh! He or she, ’tis no matter. Send
A troo a bank.” So through the Bank of
Capricornia Craytli sent the money, and
then advised Wagstaff, and waited at Thurs-
day Island for a reply. But none came from
Wagstaff. Instead, the bank informed him
that the money was ready in Sydney to be
paid over to Wagstaff on proof of identity.
And by the time that Craytli knew that, he
had missed the last daylight tide, and was
forced to stay at Thursday Island for an-
other night. And he spent most of the time
worrying as to the means of paying Denny
O’Rourke. That night in O’Rourke’s bar
the talk was long and general, for there was
a new thing in wrecks.
“Another man trying to sail overland,”
said Druce the pilot. “Some of these over-
sea men beat hell. One of ’em took an ob-
servation, and when we worked it out, it put
the position of the ship 18 miles inland.”
“What do be the name of the ship a-
shore?” asked Denny O’Rourke, and the an-
swer came from half a dozen men.
“The Rangoon. She had 600 horses for
Bombay .. . hit a reef north of Cape Flattery
.. . engine room bulkhead door open ...
no ! no ! bulkhead door broken ... well, they
think they could repair it or something...
pump her out, and ghe'd float enough to tow
... nearly all the horses drowned .. . couple
of score on the main deck got ashore ... all
the others done in ... they want divers ...
nearly all the shell divers away.. . and the
fellows spelling ashore won’t take the job
... she sunk in five or six fathoms of water
up to the main deck.. . but they think she’s
only injured in one place, and they might
pump her.”
A new thought brought a new hope to
Crayth. He had never dived yet—but——
“Where’s Bill Tunks?” asked Dan’l
Haynes, the withered, bloodless cripple, who
had found paralysis in 28 fathoms.
“Didn’t you know?” said Druce. “Bill’s
dead —drowned in a dress last week.”
“Dead —is he? An’ I’m left,” quavered
Dan’l Haynes. “I’m left. He! he! he! an’
Jim Marsh is dead, too—they hauled him
up dead in his dress, they did, an’ torn was
the dress, too —Dursted in by a devil fish.
An’ a big horned ox-ray—they’ll never let;
you go wance they touch air-pipe or life-
line, me man—it tore Andy Blake’s air-pipe
to smithereens.”
Crayth listened to these horrors of the
work, and found himself dismissing them in
consideration of the money.
“Well, the agents are tearing their hair
lookin’ for a man,” said Druce. “I met
Jeffries just now, and he’s got a tug ready
to start, and no diver. He might have to take
a Jap on yet, and he hates . Japan like
poison. Where’s Kermander got to?”
“Jack Kermander?” said Danny Burke.
“He’ll never dive again. No, he isil’t dead,
he’s buried. He married a shypoo shop
over in Broome and a widder with it —-gave
himself away to a woman for a watch and
chain and a bit shackle, an’ he sit all day
behind the bar an’ takes money for beer, an’
he do be gettin’ fat.”
“It’s better to die of a widder than get
paralysed in 30 fathoms,” said Druce. “Gim-
me a pleasant death, if I must die.”
“The men come and go, and then don’t
come back again,” said Dan’l Haynes. “Bin-
tura, the Manila man —his gear fouled, and
suffocated he was; an’ Willie Ikers, the
Rotumali, he died of paralysin’, an’ ”
“There’s plenty of ’em,” interrupted
O’Rourke; “Mshinmura, an’ Mshioka Ki-
makichi, and Feliciano, an’ Sankiclii Taka-
kaski, an’ ”
“You’ll die of lockjaw talking all them
monkey names,” said Druce.
Crayth had been intently regarding
O’Rourke, and thinking of the £3O. “You’re
a man, Denny O’Rourke,” he said to him-
self. “And you’ll never lose a penny by
me. It doesn’t matter if I haven’t dived be-
fore? I’ll take my chance and dive for that
liorse-boat.”
And he left the bar and sought Jeffries,
the agent for the wrecked Rangoon.
Jeffries was a man of few words, and his
anxiety to begin clouded his judgment.
“You’re a diver, Mr.”
“Crayth—l can dive.”
“And d’ye think y’ could rig a temp’ry
door in the middle compartment?”
“Yes. I’ve done bush carpentering, and
I can use a drill and make a horseshoe.”
“Well, all right. I’ve got the gear on the
tug. Will you start?”
“Yes, but what do I get?”
“Fifty pound, anyhow, and a hundred if
it’s right.”
Crayth avoided Denny O’Rourke’s hotel on
the way down to the wharf, and departed to
take the greatest risk of his life.
The tug ran the 350 miles in a day and a
half —Bushy Island, Oxfordness, Cape Gren-
ville, Onion Island, Cape Sidmouth, past
Claremont light—and reached Flinders Group
late in the next afternoon. All the way
Crayth had no fears, but many misgivings
as to his capacity for the work. And in the
attempt to be an old hand, he overlooked the
air-pump and helmet and corselet and air-
pipe and life-lines, while the tug sped south
and brought the trial nearer.
The outer course for ships north of Cape
Flattery is between Lizard and Eagle Is-
lands. The Rangoon, taking the inner pas-
sage between Hares Reef and Decapolis
Island, had foundered in five fathoms. They
reached the wreck and anchored. The masts
and funnel of the Rangoon stuck out of the
water. The open hatches —open always to
admit air to the hold full of horses —showed
the clear light of water by contrast with the
blackness of horseboxes and decks.
Crayth, drifting in the tug’s dinghy over
the wreck just before the sudden darkness
closed in, saw with gladness that the rushing
water had carried the horse ramps and stag-
ings upwards as she sank, and thus he
would have a clear hold. Hundreds of
horses, drowned and living, had been floated
out of the ship, and had drifted to safety or
destruction. But many horses were still
there, drowned and held from floating by
their head-stalls, for the ship, after the first
rush, had sunk gradually and evenly, so
that Crayth was moved to hope that the
damage was not great, and that the Ran-
goon might be raised. And then he saw
great grey rapacious shapes showing in the
lighter water above the hold like a moving
picture in n frame—sharks tearing th«


drowned horses. And at that Crayth shud-
dered.
He went back to the tug-beat trying to
prevent imagination from exaggerating fear.
He shaved clean, and then got the cook to
shave liis neck sb that there would be no
hair to catch the thread 6f a screw. And lie
talked to himself thus: “I mustn’t forget—
sink quickly and rise slowly—-and not be
afraid.”
And he was immediately afraid again when,
“the sea hath its
PEARIS.”
in the darkness, he saw the black below torn
by rushing white hre —the phosphorescent
stragglings of the sharks as they bit and dis-
membered. But he went to sleep without
any thought of backing out, and slept well,
and awoke to a dull morning. He'break-
fasted heartily as the condemned do bn their
last day, and then he clothed himself in
thick woollen undergarments, and the ten-
ders dressed him in the canvas dress with
the rubber bands at ankles, and at wrists,
and they gave him 50 pounds’ weight of
brass-toed boots to wear, and laced his heavy
helmet on his chest, and put on back weights,
and then began to pump, and the tender
screwed on the face glass and tapped on it.
He was alone —separate from all the
world. A free and abundant supply of air
thudded irritatingly into the helmet, and his
breathing was not difficult. But excitement
made it rapid. That isolation, immediate
and complete, from the breathing world
while still being in it made the apple of his
throat to rise, and he choked over the
swallowing of it. The air had lifted the
weight from his back and chest, but he felt
he was a monstrous thing, leaden-footed,
bloated with clothes. Shame of his fear and
the pride of a man forced him to let go of
the ladder. He opened the valve and sank
into feathers. It was entrancingly soft and
caressing. He saw the reflected daylight on
the keel of the tug-boat, and fell more
rapidly, and then the pace made the impres-
sion of feathers change to the feeling of
liquid silk.
He was over the reef, and a little current
swirled across it but not enough to fatigue
him in struggling against it. His feet sank
in the coral trash and weed. Groves of rose
and madder and purple corals were about
him, and grottoes of corals blazed in indigo.
But Crayth was too busy troubling about his
sensation to have an eye for beauty.
He talked to himself as the loneliness of
the bush had taught him to do, and his own
voice startled him as it reverberated in the
helmet. He gasped relief as his feet reached
the coral, and then he thanked the luck that
had sent him on the port side of the ship,
and by the hole that had sunk the Rangoon.
It was not a great hole. A few buckled
plates and a few more strained had admitted
enough water to sink the vessel to the level
of the great square ports on the ’tween
decks used for cleaning ship, and these were
always open ror ventilation. Onlv a foot
or so of freeboard she had had. The broken
plates had sunk her to the level of the open
doors, and the Rangoon was drowned by 12
inches of water.
Crayth measured the broken plates, and
wrote the measurements on his slate, and
grey shapes swam to him curiously.
Crayth looked _ about him and saw forms
forms of horrible edacity—rising above
and around him. The exhaust air from the
surging to the surface in great
bubbles of mobile silver seemed to frighten
the cruel cowards above him, and those near
the bottom backed from the advance of this
strange creature, which seemed neither help-
less nor afraid. But as he signalled to be
drawn to the surface, they closed in, finding
courage to follow a thing that ran, and
Crayth wished with all his soul that he might
be drawn up slowly.
They only attack the thing that seems to
be helpless or running away. With a neiv
idea, he tied his hammer-headed axe to the
end of the light line lie carried coiled at his
waist, and dropped it almost to the bottom,
and raised it again half way, and again
dropped it. Interest immediately centred on
uw W that showed the greatest speed.
Ihe sharks sank after the axe, and Crayth
rose and gripped the ladder with the grip of
a drowning man. Om the rung clear of the
water he drew the axe up Swiftly, and the
8 *.cJi S P ursu ed it in flashes of grey light.
oharks much trouble?” asked the tender
as he relieved Crayth pf breast and back
weights, and the natural air came back to
be gratefully breathed by the diver.
“They’re all around me.”
“They’ll be worse in the ship itself.
“Thank you,” said Crayth to lnmsell. it s
you for heartening a man up.” But lie re-
plied • “I’ll get rid of ’em as soon as 1 can.
if 1 can think of something to frighten ’em.”
“Can she be raised V”
“I’m.sure. She’s not much injured—gone
down through having open ports all doors
open—compartment doors open too,' I should
say.”
“Must be a few sharks in her.” y
“Not many,” replied Crayth, putting the
best complexion on matters, and saying to
himself: “Don’t, let yourself go—don’t meet
anything until it comes to you.”
“They’d be a lot if most of the horses
hadn’t floated out.”
And Crayth thanked God for the open
hatch that floated tne horses away after it
had also admitted the filthy life of the depths
lading in the blackness of the hold, and wait-
ing for something helpless or afraid.
“Send the whaleboat to the lighthouse for
more divers if they want the work done
quickly, and tell ’em to' send pumps.”
“Got a big enough pump here,” said the
captain of the tug.
“Right then—we’ll have the Rangoon good
again in quick time,” said Crayth confi-
dently to hide the fear that crept over him,
struggle against it as lie might.
But in spite of fear the work had to be
done, and Crayth hurried to it after a little
food and rest.
Then they moored the tug nearer the Ran-
goon, so that they looked almost directly
over the open hold framing the water. A
great grey shape wavered in it like a shadow
and disappeared.
The engineers were already boring new
plates to Crayth’s measurements. He heard
the cheerful sounds of the working-world
hammers on heated steel, and then he sank
again.
Crayth stepped off the ladder and stood
on the deck of the Rangoon, and his helmet'
was out of water. Then he-'walked to the
hatch, and sank again, and gripped all his
courage.
DEFINITIONS.
DAUGHTER: “ Father , what's a bigot?”
FATHER: “A bigot , my child , is a person who
doesn't think the same as I do and sticks
to his opinion."
Glad was he to see in the row of stalls
but one of the dead horses on the port side
and three on the starboard; and he was
almost reassured at finding but two sharks
great grey brutes of 14ft. or so.
He drove them away, and found them
back near him as soon as he became motion-
less, or stooped to look at the inner skin of
the ship. But the sharks retreated as he
stood erect and advanced to them. He
found the port side door of the amidships
compartment, and closed it., and then went
to the starboard door, and in the alley way
was a gorged shark—tail on to him. Crayth,
trembling in every nerve, closed that door
and the shark was a prisoner.
“If he can’t get out the other end, we’ll
suffocate him slowly when she pumps,” said
Crayth, joyfully.
And so he worked for two hours, trying to
forget the grim death that hovered around,
and doing everything with his usual tho-
roughness.
Flash! A grey thing, deceived by his
motionless pose, turned on its back as it
made a dash at him. He thought agon-
isedly of his air pipe, and held it to him
while aiming a futile blow at the greedy
mouth set with four rows of gleaming teeth.
The coward of the seas turned with the
speed of light as another grey shape wav-
ered from the gloom forward, and then wav-
ered back again.
Desperate with all this goading, and feel-
ing strangely light, for abundant air came
down to him and relieved him of the pressure
of the weights, Crayth pursued the first
shark, and chased him through the open
doors into the outer sea. Then, glad with
achievement, he swung the doors to and
bolted them with his face turned away from
his work to where the other horror lay con-
cealed. And, looking always to the black-
ness forward, he shut all the ports in the
area under the hatch on both sides.
The work in the foreliold was at last com-
pleted, except the closing of the hatch. In
this other men must help. Now retreat be-
came more dangerous than advance.
How to ascend and escape the watching
murderer. The incident of the axe returned
to the diver —but the axe did not bulk
large enough in the half-darkness to dis-
tract the pursuer. And then he kicked
against a coal basket, and fastened its rope
slings to his line, backed to the after end of
the hatch, and gave the signal to ascend.
As his head was level with the hatchway,
the shark made his rush. Crayth tugged
his life-line again, and the ascent became
rapid. The coal basket came between the
shark and the light. He turned on his back'
to attack it, and his jaw snapped half-way
round the cane and spun it in the water.
Then the shark rose to the other figure, but
Crayth was on the ladder, and the disap-
pointed brute sank back again to the
drowned horses.
Crayth, trembling from the stress, and
seeing a fin ploughing the water round the
tug, said he would dive no more that day.
“We’ll clear ’em out before you go again,”
said the captain of the tug. “It ’u’d take the
heart out of a lion to be with a lot of those
things in the dark. I’ve got a rifle and a
junk of pork.”
“Half a day at them will clear the atmo-
sphere,” assented Crayth.
“Only—one bad thing—the blood will
bring up others, and you’ll be fighting all
the sharks in the Pacific.”
“No blood,” said the African, who was
cook. “No blood. I give ’em pumpkin. You
know? All right—you wait.”
And the sinister fin made an ellipse in the
water around the tug. and then the cook
said he was ready. He brought from the
galley a great ironbark pumpkin boiled in
the copper and hot with steam, and as the
ploughing fin passed the ladder he dropped
the ball of heat.
The shark flashed, turned on his back and
swallowed. And then Crayth, mad with the
lust of hate, slapped the cook on the back
and laughed hysterically, for the shark went
mad with agony, sinking and rising and
thrashing the water, and at last disappear-
ing utterly.
Then Crayth, reversing his earlier deci-
sion, went down aft, and found the Rangoon
there unbroken and resting safely on a bed
of rotten coral trash. He closed all doors
and ports, and fastened the doors of the
compartments, and saw far forward a phos-
phorescent trembling in the water —the great
gorged shark, now absolutely prisoned.
. The safety of the morning had heartened
him, and he treated the smaller sharks in
the afterhold with a sort of cheerful con-
tempt, tempered still by disgust and fear.
And now there remained but the hatches to
be closed, and the plates to be fixed, before
the pumps began their work. He had be-
come used to the horrors, and determined to
be repaid for them.
“I’ll fix the plate myself—they’ve got a
pneumatic riveter aboard- I’ll do it and
divide the money with nobody.”
So he had bored the holes below by the
time the plates
were ready. And
when he sank
again, the com-
pressed air from
the riveter so
scared his ene-
mies that he
once caught
himself singing
ridiculously in
his helmet. And
the pneumatic
riveter punched
and spluttered
and drove the
rivets home, and
tied the new
and clumsy
plates to the
ship. And when
Crayth came to
the surf ac e
again he saw
through his face
g'lass two
steamers and
two new divers,
and his pleased
employer stand-
ing by the lad-
der, and with
him a man
strangely like one who should then
be in Sydney, 2000 miles away.
And when they screwed off' his
face alass he saw Jack Wa^staff
really present. “ '
“Why”
“Good old George! A thief who knew we
were mates somehow tried to swindle you
but the bank wouldn’t pay without identifi-
cation.
“And you’ve not been in Sydney?”
I was first officer of the Rangoon. I’ve
,< n . in Cooktown ever since the wreck.”
( ‘And how did you know?”
The bank told Denny O’Rourke, and
lfenny knew I was in Cooktown, and wired
tO -/r?-, * VOTI l <now - And Denny’s wire
said: ‘That good fool Crayth is trying to
pay me back, and he's no diver.”
‘‘But ain’t you?” asked Crayth’s em-
ployer. “xou said you could dive.”
‘ So I have eiten —in the baths,” replied
who nad fought fear and beaten it.
‘ Well, you’ve done it, so they tell me,”
said t;re agent of the Rangoon. “And
these two men can fasten the hatches down
and get her ready for the pumps.
So the two mates had a battle of sharks
that afternoon with a piece of pork and
Winchester rifles. And by dusk of next day
hatches were fixed and battened down, and
all upper openings closed, and in the soft
starlit night the pumps began to work—
each tug-boat attacking a compartment.
From the coral the Rangoon slowly rose,
dripping sea ooze and reeking slime. She
made a little water through the clumsy
plates, but her engine-room was dry, and
while the tugs bent lines to her for the long
tow to dock, the engineers got the Rangoon’s
pumps going under her own steam.
‘AVe’ve got a shark of yours in the chief
alley way,” said the engineer to Crayth,
looking down from the deck of the Rangoon
to the little steamer that had salved her.
“It’s i your shark, and it don’t smell nice.”
“There'll be a few more in the fore and
aft holds,” replied Crayth, laughing. “I
give you the lot.”
And the tug with the mates —the diver,
and Wags t a ft, the sailorman—beat the hot
sea northward to Thursday Island.
RANDOLPH BEDFORD.
Man!
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
IN the dim and misty ages, ere chronology
began,
A Disturbance struck this planet, and
the name of it was Man.
’Twas a sort of bull-volcano that arrived
upon the earth,
And has hustled ’round this planet since its
devastating bir.th!
’Twas a restless he-tornado, raised God-
knows-how-long b.c. ;
And to-day this same Disturbance rushes
’round incessantly !
It is hurrying and roaring-—it is sprinting
o’er this ball,
And its hands are full of shekels and its feet
■ are swift to fall!
With its axes and its hammers, with its tele-
scopes and guns,
It is tearing ’round this planet and is
measuring the suns !
With its stamps and. mills a-clamor —with
its creeds and governments,
It is dragging out the vitals of astonished
_ continents!
It is leaping through the forest with the
broad-axe and the saw ;
And it calls its fads Commandments and its
views are known as Law!
’Tis a very strange Disturbance—’tis a sub-
stance extra-queer;
But its ways are wavs of vigor and its grab
is most sincere;
It has pleased itself with ethics —gazed
awhile with cynic eyes
At the antics of the prophets and the gospels
of the wise!
It has pondered creeds and Korans. New
and ancient Testaments
It has taken to its bosom—and lias sold for
twenty cents!
It lias bowed to Booth and Dowie, wor-
shipped idols cneap and strange;
Tis at times a whale on prayer—and yet it
always counts the change!
It is cautious and it’s steady, and it’s wild
and vain and rash.
It has one eye fixed on Heaven; it has two
upon the cash.
It ariseth in the morning, and it sitteth
down at night,
But it lioldeth fast the plunder—yes, it
grabs the shekels tight!
Hanging on to wisps of paper, clutching fast
its precious stones,
Lo, it dredgeth up the ocean and exploits its
parents’ bones!
For the Pharaohs in their coffins, who dis-
turbed the earth of yore,
Are a source of cheerful profit—-hear the
ghost of Tnothmes roar!
Hear the wail of ancient Sargon, and like-
wise of Itameses,
As their tombs are wrecked and plundered
after fifty centuries!
See this querulous Disturbance, how it
hustles swiftly on;
Ilow To-day diverts To-morrow when the
first is dead and gone!
Yea, when we are all deported—when our
bones are very dry,
Man will speculate upon us, and the scien-
tists will lie.
They will tell amused To-morrow what our
customs used to be;
How we hired us gangs of Talkers who
orated uselessly!
They will guess and wax excited, pawing
plans and dusty maps,
They wilt fiercely argue whether we were
Dhows, Malays or Japs !
But those scientists will moulder, so let
Thothmes cease his bleat —
The Disturbance hits the landscape w T ith its
large and tireless feet!
The grave that swallowed Pharaoh waited
too tor us and them;
bee the comic kings a-strutting, proud of
throne and diadem!
AVhen To-morrow s day is finished, it will
toss its marble in;
And the Day That Cometh After will ex-
pound new-fangled sin !
lor the same old man-contraption will ex-
ploit the suffering earth,
And will shake the pubs of Saturn with his
fury and his mirth!
flabbergasted planet-dwellers will deplore
our ways in Mars,
When the Day That Cometh After steals
rich plunder from the stars!
For throughout the dusty ages, since chro-
nology began,
There has raged a fierce Disturbance—and
As name is only Man!
Tis a storm that blows incessant through
the keyhole of the years ;'
And to-day it flops ecstatic towards the fear-
astounded spheres!
It has lied and grabbed and wrangled, har-
nessed steel to hissing steam;
Now with new and fearsome weapons see it
. chase the golden gleam!
It is flapping, it is flying; but so long as it
shall be,
It shall load its drays with dollars— if you
doubt me, lice and see!

DOING TWO THINGS AT ONCE.
Quite a physiological interest has been created in England on the subject of ambidexterity in consequence of the
success of the left-handers in the Australian team.


STRAY PHYMES
(FOR THE BULLETIN.).
The Sea.
IS it lapping or language? Surge or a
soul ?
And the combers that batter the sands.
Are they the froth of a shaken bowl,
Or the fury of pinioned hands?
Is the tide a nurse that asleep shall rock
The fretting world at last?
Or a pendulum dead to a demon clock.
Through a shuddering vortex fast?
The forced caress of a moon-wooed trull.
Or the cry of souls for their Source?
The random bilge of a derelict hull.
Or the lymph of Eternal Force?
To the souls marooned on the prisoning land
Do their lost sea-kin complain?
Or is it but raid of dead surge on the sand.
Dead sand in the surge again?
Humors that ooze and, glistering, dance
In the slough of a green-rimmed scar?
Stale drops wrung by a fumbling Chance
From the shroud of a clammy star?
Or the Dew in a Lotus borne aloft.
On- ripples of Love unseen?
The eyes of a Living Creature soft
With desire for a welkin queen?
Do a dead wind’s wheels the dead foam
spurn.
As blind to a void they dash?
Or sylphs on a zephyr riding turn
And the undine tomboys splash?
Is a ripple the yawn of a wakening wave,
Or the note of a Triton chord?
The petulant wince of a wind-whipped slave,
Or a dimple announcing her Lord?
An idiot sapper laying low
Creation, is the sea?
A sour solution dropping slow
Drab continents to be?
Or the Rose of Renewal seraphs steep
Attar of rain to make?
The soothing Word of God, asleep?
A flail of His Wrath, awake?
Was it only a nest for our younger selves
In the days of the fin, and now
Is it only a mine where the fisher delves,
A road for the trading scow?
Or the opal demesne of another Law
Than rules in our dim abode?
The Changing Land that the sailor saw
As the Gaelic sea-god rowed?
Over the rim of the rushing skiff.
The pennon weeds below,
Hy-Brasil appears, and the magnet cliff
And the rivers of Eden flow!
The Changing Land wherein, among
Unearthly-gleaming braes.
Wander the folk of the Ever-Young,
And the hind of Ossian strays!
Where Ponce de Leon is sailing on,
And slumber the Isles of Bliss !
Where Leda’s is that comely swan,
And Lir’s sad daughter this!
Or can it be ourselves, the sea?
Our nerves its sifted mud ?
Our pulses still its rippling glee?
Its water in our blood?
Yea, proud amphibian emigrants,
With her own tears we weep:
In our working veins her high tide pants.
And still she ebbs in sleep!

BERNARD O'DOWD.
Ballade of Vain Longing.
Oh, that I had the wings of a little dove; for
then would I fly away and be at rest. —The
Psalmist.
WITH hope and fear alternate in each
breast,
Clear song and sorrow, joy and
orison,
Good hap, unsought, and unrewarded quest.
And pride, and stern ambition that makes
wan ;
With pains remitted and delights fordone,
Where sateless Death waits all things in
the West,
The great procession of the world moves
on—
But I would fly away and he at rest.
Let good deeds shine and sins be uncon-
fessed.
Let Truth be hid, and Wisdom motley
don;
Let tyrants thrive and tame folk be op-
pressed ;
Let menacing armies march in echelon ;
Let priest and princelet pose as Paragon,
lime and the Event will put them to the
test
As they have tested all men dead and
gone!
But I would fly away and be at rest.
The things of earth men seek for with such
zest
And hand as heirlooms down from sire to
son,
What are they but poor, tinsel gauds at best
We wear a little while, and shed anon?
Better one cup from crystal Helicon
lhan cloth of gold, or coin, or lordly crest!
Let fools crave Fame and find —Oblivion,
But I would fly away and be at rest.

Philosophers and bards in unison
May chant Life, Love and Death, the
Anapest
Of God’s eternal epic none may con —

Years and You.
SOMETHING I knew —as you half-
recline
By the sandalled feet of the casement-
saint
With the sun-haze warm on your profile-
line —
Ultimate, far and faint,
Steals to my sense through a gate ajar,
Stealthy as footfalls on velvet are.
White on the altar where Thought ungyved
Sits in the midmost mind'of me —
Limned with the lives that my dead selves
lived,
Writ that my soul may see—
Folded the Book of my being lies,
Filled with the years and their mysteries.
Paged with my Egos (to each a page)
Moveless it sleeps in its still recess,
Pregnant of soldier and seer and sage,
Till with a slow caress
This shy sweet breath, that the leaves lifts
through,
Rustles and opes it —the sight of you!
As the grey great tide and the shouting
storm,
As little shadows that sneak and slip
Through the feathered grasses ; living-warm
As lip to a living lip—
Runs the passionate script of the lives that
look
From the turning leaves of the Ego-Book.
The page filings backward —the old years
ring
(The leaf lies wide at your pictured
face!)
With war, and the galleys dip and swing
In the sweep of a harbor-race;
And queening all is a face I know,
And a white hand grips on a singing bow.
Still gleams, O queen, through a dead veiled
space,
(I greet you here, white-handed One!)
The aureoled light behind your face
Rose-framed in the dipping sun.
O jewelled sea! O jewelled eyes! . . .
The clamor drowns —the vision dies!
Hail, hot arena! Hail, blood-blotched sand!
(Your silver face, O queen, shines there!)
I stretch to you my gauntlet-hand,
I see you—lithely fair—
Calm-souled —the awning-fringe above —-
The maundering captain’s lisping love.
Beneath the purple fringe has crept
One ray, to touch the sand below
(Patched red where gory feet have stept),
And frame your face aglow—
The greedy stark-blue steel leaps on —
Art where, queen-face? Grey—glazing—
gone!
The broad page turns, and I stand erect
In the chiselled gloom, where you knelt
and heard
The drone of the priestly genuflect,
The bell and the mumbled Word,
While the yellow shaft of the chancel-light
Burned on your brow as it burns to-night.
The wan light weakens on figured tomb,
On ruff and kirtle —yet scintillates
Like a gem in the heart of the girdled gloom.
Your face fades —dissipates
In the_ altared dusk where the incense rose . .
The dim page darkens —the covers close!
O thrice-known whiteness ! Warrior-queen !
O regal Roman returned again!
O thrice-dear worshipper serene
Of the grey mediaeval fane!
I know you one, though I may not look
’Twixt the close-clasped leaves of the Ego-
Book.
Dear, fourfold-dear, for I know you such
As I knew of old, as your side-face shines
Where the timid, slow sun-fingers touch
With their luminous glowing lines;
And your crowned brow fetters my mind to-
day,
With a fourfold link, to the Far-Away.
Something once known —as you half-recline.
By the sandalled feet of the casement-
saint
With the sun-haze warm on your profile-
line —
In a time that is far and faint,
Steals to my sense while I watch you there
In the lustrous, darkening window-square.

JAS. A. ALLAN.
A Ballad of Elderly Kids.
NOW this is the ballad of Jeremy Jones,
And likewise of Bobadil Brown,
Of the Snooks and the Snaggers and
Macs and Malones,
And Diggle and Daggle and Down.
In fact, ’tis a song of a fatuous throng,
Which embraces “the man in the street,”
And the bloke on the ’bus, and a crowd more
of us,
And a lot of the people we meet.
Yes, this is the story of Jack and of Jill,
Whose surnames are Snawley or Smith,
And of Public Opinion and National Will,
And samples of Popular Myth.
For Jeremy Jones, as a very small boy,
Was encouraged to struggle for pelf,
And to strive very hard in his owu little
yard,
But never to think for himself.
Then, Hi-diddle-diddle, the cat and the
fiddle,
Come, sing us a nursery rhyme.
For, in spite of our tohiskers, we elderly
frisk ers
Are kiddies the most of our time.
So this is the song of the juvenile throng,
And its aunts and its big brother Bill,
Its uncles and cousins, and sisters in dozens,
Louisa and ’Liza and Lill.
Now, Jeremy Jones was exceedingly “loyal,”
And when any procession went by,
He’d cheer very loud with the rest of the
crowd,
Though he honestly couldn’t tell why.
He was taught that his “rulers” toiled hard
for his sake,
And promoted the “general good” ;
That to meddle with “customs” was quite a
mistake,
And Jones didn’t see why he should.
To gird at the “Order of Things as they
Are,”
He was told, was the act of a fool.
He was taught, in effect, to regard with
respect
Ev’ry “Precedent,” “Practice” and “Rule.”
And if we deserted the “Usual Plan ”
He believed that the nation would fall.
So Jones became known as a “right-think-
ing man,”
Which meant that he didn’t at all.
Oh, Little Miss Muffett, she sat on a tuffet,
But fled from a spider in fright;
For no one haa told her that if she teas
bolder,
She might have asserted her right.
Ho, rub-a-dub-dub, three men in a tub.
On a sea of political doubt;
And they argue together concerning the
weather,
But never attemnt to get out.
They made him a grocer when Jerry left
school,
a j yer y good grocer was he;
And a dunce he was not, for he knew quite
a lot
T 3 natters as treacle and tea.
-L>ut the making of nations, and things so
immense,
He considered beyond his control.
He was busy on week-days at saving his
pence,
And on Sundays at saving his soul.
But politics Jones did not wholly neglect;
He subscribed to a paper, The Sage ;
And every morn, with becoming respect,
He scanned its political page.
He believed what was said in each leader
he read,
F° r a “right-thinking oerson” was he,
Who was shocked at their vices, who growled
of the prices
Of sugar or treacle or tea.
Oh, Little Jaclc Horner sits in a corner,
A look of delight in his eye,
At the sight of a plum on the end of his
thumb,
While there's somebody sneaking his pie.
Then, ride a cock hoss to Banbury Cross—
Though the Lord only knows why we do.
But there's precedent for it, and those who
ignore it
We class as an ignorant crew.
So Jeremy Jones he meanders through life,
Behaving as Grandmother bids;
And so do his very respectable wife
And extremely conventional kids.
Their bosses can trust ’em, for habit and
custom
They’ve learnt in the regular school;
And they call him “right-thinking,” while
privately winking
And setting him down as a fool.
Convention’s his master; he vows that dis-
aster
Will swiftly encompass its foes.
He thinks Evolution a Labor delusion,
And “Progress” a “something” that grows.
He’s one of the many—a credulous zany—
The leadable, bleedable type—
Who looks upon “Time”-—as instructed by
Granny—
As something that rarely is ripe.
Oh, Goosey, goose gander, where do you
wander?
Only, kind sir, inhere I'm told;
For my master has said l mast go where
I’m led,
And to contradict him would be bold.
And Little 80-peep she lost her sheep.
It’s the Socialist’s fault, she’ll insist.
But leave her to grieve, for she’ll never be-
lieve
That a Meat Trust could ever exist.
Then this is the ballad of elderly kids,
Of Jeremy Jones and his kind,
Of Bobadil Brown, and Daegle and Down,
And the crowd with the juvenile mind.
Oh, this is a song of the National Will,
Of the Snooks, and the Snaggers, and
Smiths,
Their aunts and their cousins, and big
brother Bill,
Convention, and Popular Myths.
A sad little song of the fatuous throng,
A string of sedate little rhymes,
Concerning the crowd who consider it wrong
To collide with the “trend of the tinm-v
A song about Us, who are missing the ’bus,
While we trifle and toy with pretence.
For we play very hard in our own little
yard,
But we seldom look over the fence.
Then, Hi-diddle-diddle, the cat and the
fiddle —
We're never concerned with the cause.
Let’s giggle and sing for the Trust and the
Ring
Are really our old Satita Claus.
Effects may surprise us, but Granny’ll advise
us;
We’ll ever behave as she bids.
110, grocers and drapers, let’s stick to the
papers;
We're all of us elderly kids.

Her arms were truly round his neck;

Demanded all things save a check
Of bliss.

The Elysian Hunt Club Meet.
DIANA, the huntress! She breaks
through the trees —
The stars flash their whiteness like
flame on her knees,
And deep as Thor’s thunder, the tune of the
hounds
O’er shadowy dingle and hillock resounds.
The hawk hangs a horror athwart the May
moon, v,.;, ;
The swans ruffle slowly along the lagoon,
And red gleams the path where the spent
boar has gone,
While the dryads all cheer the glad goddess
on.
Pan roars like the Devil and joins in the
chase,
And the sneezing young fawns lean down to
the pace,
Till fresh from the stables old Hercules
strides,
With straw in his whiskers and leonine
hides;
Swift. Mercury skims like a bird through the
air,
And Vulcan comes puffing from out of his
lair
In a terrible splutter of fire and of soot,
As the horn sounds again its “rooti-ti-toot,”
And the shade of Adonis exults from the
sky,
For odds are a hundred his slayer must die.
“Well driven, Diana!” Then, crash in the
track
The boar topples prone on the pork of his
back.
But, Oh . . . Who could think it? . . .
The god's out of breath . . .
Through chasing a poor little pig to his
death!!

The Lobster and the Lioness.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
AT 11 o’clock Thomson, who had broken
his glasses during a last whirling-
argument re the chances of the
Liberal candidate, was pushed gently
out the side door and told to go home.
Instead of taking the barman’s advice, he sat
on the horse-trough, and held an indignation
meeting with himself until Sergeant Jones
happened along.
“Good-night, Mr. Thomson,” said the ser-
geant, kindly.
Thomson pushed his boxer hat to the back
of his head. “Good evenin’,” he returned
sulkily.
“Are ye comiu’ down the street?” ven-
tured the sergeant.
“Cert’nly not!” said Thomson. “I’ve lost
me glasses, an’ me eyesight’s ’stremely bad.
I can’t see what I’m doin’!”
“Well, come along and walk with me. I’ll
see ye as far as the gate.”
Thomson rose unsteadily. “I tol’ you be-
fore I’ve broken me glasses. Do you mean
to ’sinuate I’m drunlc ?”
“I do not!” said the sergeant. “I never
saw a soberer man in my life! P>ut come
along now, an’ I’ll tell ye somethin’ 1 lieerd
to-day about Prince Foote f’r th’ Cup. I’m
goin’ your way !”
Op those honorable terms, Thomson con-
descended to take up his lobster, and allow
Jones to pilot him gently toward his lodg-
ings.
According to Thomson’s reckoning, they
had trudged through 283 deserted streets,
and turned 1834 strange and unexpected
corners, when he found they were both
standing still on a vacant piece of land, in
front of an enormous board with “For Sale”
on it.
“Wliasser matter?”
“I heerd a strange sound,” answered the
sergeant. “Be quiet a minit! Maybe we’ll
hear it agin!”
They waited breathlessly. . . .
A deep, muffled grunt arose close by.
“That’s it!” said the sergeant excitedly.
“Somebody’s drunk,” sighed Thomson
wearily. “Sailor prob’ly.”
The sergeant snorted. “No sailor ever
made a sound like that! Look, it’s gettin’
up 1 Is it a dog? . . .Run, man! run for your
life!” he yelled, and ran heavily up a dark
lane.
Thomson, swaying on his feet, patted his
leg and called encouragingly to the appioach-
ing thing, “Goo’ dog!”
Two yellow eyes glowed in the darkness.
“Goo’ dog!” cooed Thomson encouragingly,
and patted his leg again.
A deep, hungry growl.
“Gome on, ole feller. I won’t hurt yer!”
The thing with the smouldering yellow
eyes came a step nearer, and Thomson cried
out in delight, “By George! that’s finest
mastiff I’ve ever seen! I’ll get him to foller
me back to boarding-house!” He staggered
off sideways, murmuring endearments, and
stopping every few yards to flick his fingers
or pat his leg. And the escaped circus
lioness followed him as if he had been an-
other Daniel.
They went slowly up the long, flat street
that stretched away to a plain of burnished
silver —the sea. The moon had slipped
from her cloud dressing-room, and was
hurrying down the sky like a woman going-
in search of a policeman.
Thomson staggered on, hugging- his lob-
ster, till he reached a lamp-post. Then he
sat down, and, calling affectionately to the
lioness, started to eat. “Here yer are, ol’
boy,” he cooed. A claw hit the lioness on
the nose- and dropped to the pavement. The
beast growled at the indignity, but ate the
fragment, and licked her chops with evident
pleasure.
Thomson methodically dissected the food
with Ins hands and cnewed stolidly, oc-
casionally throwing a bit over his shoulder
with a mumbled word of encouragement.
The lioness sat on her haunches and growled
between courses, hut accepted the scraps with
JUST CAUSE.
PRESBYTERIAN SKY PILOT: “Misguided man ,
what drove you to drink?”
MISGUIDED MAN: “My father was a (hie)
Presbyterian parson. ”
a sort of eager humility. This went on till
the lobster was no more. Thomson then
wiped his mouth with the back of his hand,
leant against the lamp-post, and closed his
eyes. In a minute he was asleep. In an-
other 30 seconds, he gave a long, whistling
snore like the wail of a distant siren.
The wild beast, sitting erect like a thing
of stone, growled nervously.
Thomson snored again.
The lioness growled angrily.
Thomson awoke with a start. “Who said
that?” he demanded. “Who denies that
Wade’s done more f’r th’ d—d country
than th’ blauky Labor party — eh?” He
turned slightly and beheld the enormous
beast. “Goo’ dog!” he cooed. “Goo’ dog!”
Faintly, from the distant sea of city lights,
came the clear chimes of a clock, followed by
12 deep, solemn notes. Brother timepieces
to right and left answered it like watchful
guardians of the hours.
Thomson rose slowly with a look of deter-
mination and flicked his fingers. “Come on, ol’
boy! Mus’ be gettin’ home!” He stag-
gered along for about 20 yards, and the lion-
ess, her head down and her tail straight out,
tracked him step by step. Then he paused.
The beast stopped dead, with her glowing,
yellow eyes fixed on his face. Thomson
didn’t notice her; his mind was grappling
with some tremendous problem. “Where did
I leave it?” he moaned at last. “I’ll go
back an’ look!” With tremendous care, he
steered a wavering course back to the lamp-
post, moored himself to it, and peered all
round the circle of light. The thing he
sought was nowhere to be seen. “Dammit!
I wonder where I lef’ that lobster?. . .I’m
certain I had it —an’ I can smell it now !. . .
Somebody’s done me for it!”
Far up the street, approaching boot-heels
made a clear, crisp clatter in the still night.
“I’ll ask this chap if lie’s seen it!” mur-
mured Thomson, and took a firmer grip of
the post.
The lonely pedestrian came up rapidly, and
proved to be a slight young man in evening
dress.
Thomson raised his hat. “ ’Scuse me,
did you notice a ’stremcly large lobster as
you came ’long?”
The stranger stopped dead, stared past
Thomson into the gloom beyond, and, with
a muffled cry of horror, turned in his tracks,
and ran with amazing swiftness into the
night.
“Hoi’ on!” yelled Thomson after him, but
there was no answer —merely the sound of
a man running.
The lobster-loser turned disconsolately and
found the lioness looking intently in the
direction the stranger had taken. “Served
him right if I sooled th’ dog on him!” he
reflected bitterly. Then, with an air of
resignation, “Come on, Carlo, ol’ boy; if
coffee stall’s open, I'll get a pie.” Once
more he set sail, and the immense beast of
prey followed stealthily in his footsteps at
a distance of three paces.
Down the road they went, round two
corners and across an unoccupied grassy
lot, then along a dark, shop-lined street. At
the far end, near the kerb, gleamed the head-
lights of a coffee-stall. As Thomson drew
near, the proprietor was seen leaning on the
counter absorbed in reading, by the light of
his big lanterns, the account of the pre-
vious night’s fight.
Out of the darkness a command came to
him: “Hey! give’s a pie an’ ’nother f’r th’
dog !”
The proprietor looked up cheerily.
“Itiglit-o!” He put down his paper and
turned to fill the order. As he opened his
oven door, a delicious whiff of hot meat
perfumed the frosty air. The lioness in the
shadow growled loudly.
“Oo did that ?” asked the hot pieman,
suspiciously.
“Sorright,” Thomson assured him; “th’
dog won’t hurt yer.”
“Wot sorter dorg is it?” persisted the pie-
man, vainly endeavoring to see what species
of animal was beyond the light.
“Mastiff,” explained the amateur lion-
tamer wearily. “Prize mastiff —mos’ ’fec-
tionate beast. Gimme two pies!”
The pie artist extracted two of his finest
works from the oven, and placed them on
the counter just as the lioness growled hun-
grily again.
“Better give us another pie f’r th’ dog,”
said Thomson, putting a shilling down on
the counter, and taking up one of the band-
boxes of nourishment.
The coffee-stall man ignored the order,
and, leaning far over the counter, looked
into the shadow. His eyes bulged with ap-
prehension. “That ain’t no mastiff,” he
breathed at last. “It looks more like a —
Gorstktjtii !” With one mad bound lie
was over the counter and away. Thomson
howled after him indignantly, and waited
for five minutes to see if he would come
back. He didn’t. At last, Thomson climbed
carefully over the counter, threw two sizz-
ling pies to the lioness, and recommenced on
his own. Fortunately the lioness’s , share
fell into the gutter, and was thereby cooled,
otherwise tragedy would probably have hap-
pened then and there.
After the light refreshments had been con-
sumed, Thomson climbed down and invited
Carlo to follow him again. Some blind in-
stinct guiding his feet, he at last came by
devious ways to the terrace-house where he
wasn’t a star-boarder. . W’
Hanging on to the frost-cold, railings in,
the moonlight, he communed with himself
thus: “If I take tli’ dog roun’ back, I’ll
wake up all th’ dogs in th’ place and fall
over dust-box. Let’s see !. ... Yes, I better
take ole Carlo in fron’ door and go through
house. That’s it ! That’s what’ll do. Come
on, ol’ chap !” .
With extreme care and patience he at last
found the keyhole, and flung wide the door.
Then he lit a match and cooed encourag-
ingly, but in vain, until the flame burnt his
fingers. “I’ll get him in !” he muttered, and,
stumbling through to the kitchen, he found
a large piece of raw steak. After opening
the back door, he returned to the front and
waved it at the lioness. “Come on, Carlo!”
he commanded. The beast, growling slightly,
started to follow him. He backed into the
hall, intending to lure his prey right
through; but she was too quick for him.
At the foot of the stairs she darted forward,
and snatched the steak from his outstretched
hand.
“Give it here, d —n yer!” he hissed, and
made a wild grab at the goods.
The brute snarled horribly, and thumped
the floor angrily with her heavy .tail. Thom-
son staggered back and his match went out.
A door on the first landing opened explos-
ively, the wavering light of a candle illum-
ined the upper part of the staircase, and a
quavering soprano voice cried, “Is anyone
there?”
“Sorright. It’s only me!” replied Thom-
son. irritably. “I’ve gotter dog !”
The candle, a wrapped-up head and a long
thin arm appeared over the banisters. “Do
you mean to say you are bringing a dog
through the house, Mr. Thomson?”
“It won’t hurt th’ d —n house!” retorted
the bringer-home-of-lions, staring upward
defiantly.
“Mr. Thomson,” chattered the partinlly-
liidden landlady, “you are not in a fit state
to argue. I will speak to you in the morn-
ing The hand that held the candle shook
with rage, and, as a natural consequence,
the light wavered considerably.
“I am fit t’ argue, and I will argue ’slong
as I please ! An’, what’s more, I'll do Avhat
I d —n well please in th’ rotten house, and
bring as many dogs as I want inter it!' Why.
yer know yerself it’s only fit f’r dogs! Come
on. Carlo, ol’ chap !”
He made a grab at the lioness’s head, but
missed. The brute snarled again, louder
than the largest-sized dog.
“If you have any respect for yourself,”
wailed the landlady, “I say if you have any
respect for yourself, you will take that blood-
thirsty brute out of the house !”
"Gorrer bed !” shouted Thomson. “Gorrer
bed, an’ mind yer own bizness, you—you
ole meddler!”
“How dare you!” shrieked the landlady,
and fled horror-stricken to her room.
Then, alone and unseen in the hall, Thom-
son performed a really fine taming feat.
Lighting his second last match to see what
he was doing, he walked behind the lioness
and gave her a hearty kick. “Gerrout!”
he yelled, and the lioness, with an ugly
shriek, ran lightly down the hall, and out
into the yard. Thomson then shut both
doors, back and front, and stumbled heavily
upstairs to his room, where, without
troubling to undress, he climbed solemnly
into bed.
* f ! * * *
On the stroke of three he awoke and mut-
tered, "Warrer! I wonder if warrer-bottle’s
been filled?” He struggled sadly out of bed,
and blinked at the Washstand, dimly visible
by the light of the waning moon. He could
not make out a water-bottle, but something
white and round like a china bowl gleamed
invitingly by the wash-basin. “I dunno
what’s in it, but I’ll drink it, whatever it
is!” he sighed, and made dry-mouthed for
the waiting refreshment. tie seized the 1
bowl, and conveyed it half-way to his lips,
then dashed it to the floor. It bounced
lightly under the bed. “Blast th’ collar!”
he shouted, and started to fumble for
matches. He persevered nobly until the
water-jug meanly bumped against his elbow
and smashed with a terrific sound on the
floor.
“That settl.es it!” he said, and plumped
down on the bed. “I’m not goin’ t’ degrade
nieself by gettin’ drink for meself in soap-
dish!” For five wrathful minutes he sat
and savagely wondered how best to revenge
himself. Finally, lie opened his room-door
and bawled : “Where’s my shavin’ water?”
The house remained submerged in sleep.
“Where’s my shavin ’ water?” he howled
again.
The .dumb Avails flung the echoes baclj at
him; 'and outside in the yard the iron dust- !
box rolled to and fro in agony. ' Something,
hungry was ransacking'fit for nourishment. ;
“D’ye think I’m goin’ t’ wait all day f’r my
sharin’ tvater!” roared the. mastiff-finder
for the third time.
The landlady’s door flung open, and she
appeared on the threshold, done up like a
sort of original mixture of Lady Macbeth
and the' Worst Woman in Sydney after a
gas explosion. “How dare you?” she cried
tragically. “llow dare you make such a
noise Aat this hour! What do you mean by
asking for shaving water at this hour!”
Thomson, not at all abashed, lurched to
the lobby railings, and leant over like a can-
didate addressing an election crowd from
the balcony of a hotel. “What do I want
warrer for? I’ll tell yer why! I want f,
drink it!! I’ve decided t’ reform and,
join ill’ No License crowd. I’m goin’ t’
be a Wowser f ' That rotten ’ ole paper y’
gave me last week with picture of two
horses at a trough sayin’ ‘We only drink
warrer’ has made me better man! I’m
goin’ t’ A’ote No License! I think pubs are;
curse to ev’ry man! If there were no pubs,
you’d have t’ keep beer in th’ house, and we
wouldn’t have t’ go out f’r it. D’ye under-
stan’ that, Missus'? D’yer see?”
“You forget yourself, sir!” trumpeted the
landlady.
“Forgot who?”
“I say you forget yourself!”
“Oh, no, I don’t! But I wish you
wouldn’t forget t’ put warrer in my room!
Look here, it’s" all d —n fine t’ gns ’bout
’totalism, but why don’ you s’ply some
Avarrer? Has warrer gone up?”
“This is too much !” wailed the wretched
landlady. She turned and tapped sharply
with her bony knuckles on the door of the
next room, and a sleepy male Amice said:
“All right! Be there directly.”
Thomson leaned far over the railings and
sniffed suspiciously. Ilis nose wrinkled in
disgust, and he said something ip an under”
tone about the place smelling like the Zoo.
“Who's keepiu' bears?” he demanded ex-
citedly at last. “I’m not goin’ t’ stay in
place if you’re goin’ t’ take in bears!”
“You are drunk!” chattered the landlady
furiously. “How dare you say there are
animals in the house !”
Thomson sniffed again. “Why, tlr house
stinks like a circus! It’s bears, or tigers or
somethin’!”
The landlady raised a shaking hand, and
pointed an accusing finger at him. “If there
is anything in the house, you brought it in
yourself!” she intoned.
A sudden gust of rage shook Thomson to
the foundations of his being. “Same ole
gag!” he roared. “Tha’s exactly what v’
said Avhen I found th’ Avhat-d’ye-call-it!
‘Muster brought it in yerself!’ I tell yer
I didn’t bring anythin’ in! There’s bears
in th’ house, an’ I’ll leave it t’-morrer! D’ye
think I’m going t’ live in a m’agerie? S’pose
you’ll tell me nex’ I don’ know what a bear
smells like!”
The door of the other room opened, and a
tall, thin, spectacled man, in a purple dress-
ing-goAvn, stepped out. “What is all the
noise about?” he inquired bitterly, holding
his candle on high like the Torch of Liberty.
“I say that there’s hears in th’ house!”
repeated Thomson.
The tall man inhaled
deeply. “There cer-
tainly is a strong odor
of animal s,” he re-
marked acidly.
“What did I tell
yer?” cried Thomson,
triumphantly. His voice
rang through the
house, and two more
doors Avere heard to
open slightly.
The tall, embittered
man turned to the land-
lady. “I suppose, Mrs.
Tribbens. Mr. Thomson
has brought home a
monkey or something of
the kind. He seems to
be able to do just as he
pleases in this house.
I daresay we shall be-
come used to the smell
in time; but I reall.v
must object to being-
called up in the middle
of the night to talk
about the matter. Sure-
ly it would have done
in the morning!”
"You don’t under-
stand, Mr. Pyppe,” re-
torted the landlady
Avith fearful hauteur. '
“No, I’m afraid I
don’t,” said Pyppe, ir-
ritably. “The whole
thing seems ridiculous
to me. Why on earth
I should be called out
of bed at this hour of
the night to talk about
an unpleasant smell
with a man who is ob-
viously”—
Crash! The tinkle of
glass falling on stone
told the landlady that,
the kitchen Avindow had
succumbed.
“What’s thatf” she gasped. Down the pitch-
dark hall, they heard sounds which sug-
gested a burglar in stockinged feet dragging
the body of a murdered boarder over the
linoleum.
“I will see what it is !” Pyppe announced
in a loud voice, and went cautiously down-
stairs, a step at a time.
Thomson and the landlady stared after
him.
“ Who is there?” cried the brave investi-
gator, holding his candle far out over the
railings.
There was no answer.
“Who is there?” he snapped. His candle
tilted, and a drop of hot wax detached itself,
and fell into the well of gloom. A grating,
bestial roar of rage rang through the place,
and a lithe, yellow animal sprang into the
lighted radius, and stood lashing its tail.
“My God, it’s a lioness!” shrieked Pyppe,
really shaken for the first time in his life.
Ilis candle clattered from his hand, and he
rushed upstairs into his room and slammed
and bolted the door
“I toV yer so!” shouted Thomson exult-
antly outside the landlady’s door, from be-
hind which came hysterical sobs and the
shrieking of castors. “I tol’ yer there was
bears in th’ house !”
“The police!” wailed the distracted
woman. “The telephone! Ring for the
police!”
“I give you notice now,” continued Thom-
son, above the sounds of hurried barricading.
“I think it’s disgustin’! Why, your d — n
lion might have eaten my dog! I’m goin r
t’ leave t’-morrer, d’ye hear? I’m not goin’
t.’ live with lions ! I’m sick of yer stinkin’
house!”
A deep, menacing growl floated up the
staircase.
Thomson sprawled ovbr the rails.
“Shurrup !” he commanded, and the
lioness, absurdly enough, was still. “Stink-
in’ brute!” he muttered, without the slightest
sign of fear, and made for the telephone on
the landing.
In a minute or so he had the police
station, and was speaking: “That th’ p’leece
station. Yesh? Well, this is Thomson
speakin’ here. Eh? Yesh, Thomson, of
Gladstone Manshuns (I don’t think!). _ Can
yer hear? . . • I say, there’s a lion in th’
hall here waitin’ t- be fed. . . . Eh? . . .
Yes, a lion! . . . No, I’m wrong, ol’ chap—
it’s th’ lion’s wife. Are you there? .
Well, it’s waitin’ t’ be fed. I dunno who it
b’longs to, but I’m goin’ t’ leave in mornin’.
It’s stinkin’ th’ nlace out. Eh ? ... What’s
that? . . . Yesh, Gladstone Manshuns—you
know th’ place near th’ Town Hall! Eli!
. . . No, nobody’s killed; there’s nothin’
here t’ eat but boarders—never is! Are you
cornin’ along? . . . Right-o!” The bell
tinkled hurriedly in the darkness. Thomson
fumbled his way into his room and shut the
door.
It was a lovely, peaceful morning. There
wasn’t a sound until two policemen and a
little man. in the ring-costume of a tamer,
trotted round the corner.
Thomson waved frantically to them from
his window. “Go roun’ side an’ get in th’
scullery window!” he howled. “Look out
f’r my dog in th’ back yard—he’s big mastiff,
hut he won’t hurt yer. If he growls give
him a bit o’ lobstpr—he loves lobster!”

The Go-Between.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
A VE it yer own way, Jerry,” said Mr.
ZA Sharp resignedly ; “but one thin’ I do
■* *■ beg—don’t come to me when it's too
late an’ say I never warned yer.”
Mr. Maunder smiled tolerantly.
_ “ 'Ere’s a pore young feller,” he declaimed
virtuously, “lyin’ in a sick bed with ’is
doll”
“Fur shame, Jerry!” interrupted the scan-
dalised Mr. Sharp. “Wlierever’s yer man-
ners, mate?”
“Carn’t you kindly ’old that tongue o’ yers
fur jest one ’arf a minute, SamV” expostu-
lated Mr. Maunder, warmly. “I kin ’ardly
’ear meself speak a word hedgeways along o’
you. _ Wot I meantorsay is this pore young
feller’s lyin’ sick in bed with ’is young
woman nussiu’ ’im, an’ .yet when my feelin’
'cart arsts me to go an’ ’elp ’em both, ’oo
ain’t gotter friend in the ’ole world, you ups
an’ throws cold water over me.”
“Cold water wouldn’t be of no use, Jerry,”
said Air. Sharp, with conviction. “Wot you
want's plen’y o’ soft soap an’ a scrubbin'-
brush, then ’ard-b’ilin’ in the copper fur an
hour or so.”
He broke off short, shaking his head over
the futility of offering up good counsel at the
shrine of friendship, as he gazed after the
x-etreating form of his venerable colleague.
Mr. Maunder threaded his way through a
tangle of narrow streets, and paused before
the open door of a dingy lodging-house. En-
tering, he ascended a flight of rickety stairs,
and knocked modestly at the door of a small
room.
His summons was attended by a young
lady with dishevelled coppery tresses.
“’Ow’s pore Watty V” inquired Air. Maun-
der, with solicitude. “I’ve called to see if I
carn't do nothink fur ’im.”
“Step inside,” responded the girl ; “and,
fur Gapv’s sake, coax a smile outer 'im ; ’e’s
that sour”——
“Shut the door, Carrots, quick ’n’ lively,
afore I send me boot arter you,” besought
a hoarse voice from the interior of the room.
“An’ don’t stand there hobnailin’ with any
blanky bloke wot comes along—d’ye ’ear me?”
“Wot’s bin upsettin’ yer, Watty?” rskcd
Mr. Maunder, anxiously. “Why ain't yer
out a-barkin’ in the sun?”
Air. Walter Grimes scowled upon his bene-
volent visitor.
“Ho, it’s you, is it?” he vouchsafed
gruffly. “You ain’t ’urried yerself. Ere
am I layed be the leg, an’ not a soul to do
me a ’and’s turn, ’cept that grinnin’ ginger
object, Liz.”
Miss Elizabeth Bloomer laughed good-
humoredly.
“Go easy, Watty,” she said; “you'd be
badly orf if it wasn’t fur me. You’d better
tell the ole chap wot you want ’im to do—
them banks don’t keep open orl night, you
know.”
Air. Alauuder pricked up his ears.
, “Anythink I kin do fur yer I’ll be on’y too
appy,” he announced. “Well I know wot
it is to lay on a suff’rin’ bed. Why, fur two
ole year”
“Gh. stow it!” interposed the. ungracious
Mr. Grimes. “We kin guess yer worst com-
plaint. I’ll subscribe fur yer meself. Give
’im a drop o’ gin, Liz.”
.Miss Bloomer made up the prescription
with her own fair hands, and the invalid
swallowed his dose without visible i-eluct-
ance. “Now,” continued Air. Grimes, “I’ve
got 10 banknotes ’ere fur five p’und apiece.
Never mind ’ow I come by ’em—as honest as
ever your mother come by you. They’re on
the Bank of Maoriland, an’ wot I want yer
to do is, go down to their ’ead orfice in Col-
lins-street, an’ bring me back the fifty quid
in ’ard cash. ’And it over to me safe, an’
there’ll be a fiver fur yer trouble. Carrots is
goin’ with yer fur fear you lose yerself
cornin’ back.”
Air. Maunder shook his head sadly.
“I’ll do it fur yer willin’, Watty,” he
said ; “but me ’eart won’t let me leave yer
lonely on a suff’rin’ bed, an’ nobody to look
arter yer. No, no, matey; Gar—Liz, I
meantersay, shall stop along o’ you, an’ I'll
go be meself.”
“I couldn’t ’ear tell o’ yer goin’ alone,”
persisted the considerate Mr. Grimes. “I’ve
read afore this o’ pore ole addle-’eaded men,
same as you, furgettin’ ’emselves orl of a
sudden like —couldn’t even remember their
own names. Git yer ’at on, Liz.”
Mr. Alaunder swallowed his wrath with an
effort; a portion of it seemed to stick in his
throat'.*.. He glowered upon Mr. Grimes.
“Larst time I took a walk with a young
woman,” he remarked, reminiscently, “I put
me arm round ’er waist an’ kissed ’er rooby
lips. If you was to arst me why I done it,
give you a answer I could not. ’Orrid, fat-
lookin’ gufl. she was, too, with red ’air an’
speckles, same as Liz there. I s’pose it’s me
second nature, an’ wot’s the good o’ fightin’
agin nature, eh, Watty?”
“Second, child-’ood, more like,” commented
Miss Bloomer, contemptuously. “I shouldn’t
advise yer to put yer arm roun’ my waist—
you wouldn’t do it twice over. As fur kissin’
—an’ ole man like you to tork that way in-
deed ! Why, you got one foot in the grave
orready.”
Air. Alaunder shuffled his feet uneasily.
“Yer stockin’s full er ’oles,” he remon-
strated. “Surely yer sense o’ shame won't
let yer walk through the streets in stockings
with ’oles in ’em?”
Aliss Bloomer’s spirited criticism of Air.
Alaunder’s physiognomy left little to be de-
sired.
“Come now, don’t git ’avin’ no more words
together,” broke in Mr. Grimes, impatiently.
“If you’re goin’—git; if not, gimme them
notes back agin.”
“I’m ready an’ waitin’ this five minutes,”
proclaimed Liz.
Air. Alaunder grunted unintelligibly.
The surveillance which Aliss Bloomer saw
lit to impose upon her companion's move-
ments attracted 'considerable attention. In
Elizabeth-street, Jerry, taking advantage of
a block in the traffic, made a bold but unsuc-
cessful bid for freedom. The ambiguous re-
marks of an inebriated individual who fol-
lowed with interest the acrimonious couple’3
arm-in-arm progress along Collins-street
well-nigh drove Air. Maunder to madness.
Outside the main entrance of the bant, Aliss
Bloomer released her captive with reluctance.
“If you’re gorn more’n two ticks, I’ll be
in arter you,” she stated definitely.
The persecuted Air. Maunder, who had
been quarrying his mind for epithets of
weight, glared upon his dainty escort.
“If you was my daughter, I—l wouldn’t
own ter yer,” he declared venomously.
“If I was your daughter, von wouldn’t

Bloomer. “Git inside, an’ tell ’em from, me
3 r ou , vG tried yer , a.rdest to p&wh tli£it liidjus
face o’ yers, but nobody won t look at it.
It being nearly closing time, the bank
counter was thronged, and the badgered
Jerry found himself elbowed aside with a
disconcerting lack of ceremony.
“ ’Oo yer shovin’ of V” he demanded trucu-
lently of a straw-hatted youth with whom
he collided. “I s’pose you broke that little
chain o’ yers an’ run out arter the dorgs-
meat man.” „
“Wait your turn —hrst come, first served,
replied the juvenile, brusquely.
Mr. Maunder felt a light touch upon his
arm. An elderly gentleman, of benevolent
aspect, beckoned him apart.
“I can see you’re not used to this sort of
thing,” he said, with a kindly smile. “Sit
down here for a moment. I’m one of the
bank directors, and shall be glad if I can be
of any service to you. Did you wish to
make a deposit?”
Mr. Maunder eyed his questioner with
suspicion.
“I wanter git -ard cash fur fifty five-p un
notes —no, meaiitersay, for five fifty-p’un’—
fur —’ere, see fur yerself.” Breathing apo-
plectically, lie drew the bundle of notes from
the security of his bosom, and shook them
in the old gentleman’s face.
“Yes, I sge,” said the latter; “but, my dear
sir, you must allow me. to examine them
more closely. I won’t rob you.”
Mr. Maunder’s tentacles unwillingly re-
laxed.
“You seem to possess a sadly limited faith
in mankind,” went on the old gentleman,
reprovingly. “Happy is he who can go
through life, and reach the ripe age of three
score years and ten —as I have done —and
yet retain his trust in the integrity of his
fellow-creatures. Dear me! What is this?”
“Ten fifty-p’un’ notes —should say five
ten”—began the bewildered Mr. Maunder.
“My dear sir,” interrupted the old gentle-
man, with a furtive glance at Jerry’s dis-
organised features. “I regret to say that
you have placed yourself in an extremely in-
vidious —nay, even perilous position. It is
my bounden duty to enquire how these notes
came into your hands. Stolen —most in-
dubitably stolen ; mind, I don’t say by you,
but it is a very fortunate thing you did not
present them at the counter. The chief
cashier —that gentleman over there with the
bald head and glasses —would have undoubt-
edly sent for a police constable.”
Mr. Maunder’s face took a pale-greenish
hue • he gazed helplessly at the old gentleman.
“This is wot comes o’ tryin’ to do a kind-

LITTLE CHILD.
DOROTHY (looking at their
latest art purchase): " Ma,

ness to a suff’rin’ feller-creetur,” he mur-
mured, brokenly. “Watty Grimes ’is name
is, sir. I’ve bin doin’ orl I kin fur the pore
feller, let alone a ’orrid carroty-’aired young
woman wot’s waitin’ on me outside—blarst
’er! An’ ’oo, if 1 was ’im, I wouldn't so
much as look at with a clo’es-prop. ’K
arsted me to git these notes changed fur
’im, an’ agin me 1 better feelin’s I says I
would.”
“Well,” said the old gentleman, sooth-
ingly, “I am sure you are not to blame. I
should be sorry, indeed, to see you involved
in any difficulty by reason of your obedience
to the dictates of humanity. Your friend,
too—poor fellow, probably he is acting in
all good faith. Ah! I fancy I recognise a
way out of the dilemma. As I told you .be-
fore, lam a director of this bank, and’if you
hand the notes over to me, I have little
doubt that I shall ultimately be able by
their means to trace the real culprit. In
exchange I will give you my cheque for £5O
on Lovell’s Bank in Bourke-street, where I
keep a small account. I fear it is too late
for you to obtain cash to-day, but present
the draft to-morrow morning—I will make
it payable to bearer. Now, no thanks; I
am aiways glad to be of assistance to Any-
one with such an excellent heart as yours.”
Sheer astonishment at finding himself, for
the first time in his life, viewed in the light
of a philanthropist held Mr. Maunder' mute.
He stared with protruding eyes as the old
gentleman drew a cheque-book from his
pocket, and, sitting down at a small table,
wrote a cheque for £5O. This he handed to
Jerry.
“Well,” he said, rising, “I must hasten
away ; besides, we mustn’t keep your young
lady friend waiting any longer.”
The misogynist grinned vindictively.
“She ain’t no lady friend o’ mine—l ’ate
the very sight o’ the likes of ’er,” he an-
nounced, witheringly. “If you should ’appen
to know of a back wav outer this, sir, I
should be kindly thankful,”
The old gentleman shook his benevolent
head and smiled.
u blip out by the side door,” he suggested.
“I fear you have been grievously hurt by
some disappointment in early life. Ah, how
many faithful, bruised hearts walk about
this world doing good under a bushel! Fate
smites us first on one cheek, then urges us
to turn the other for a knock-out blow, my
friend.” He shook his head again as he
watched the incurably-wounded Mr. Maun-
der steal cautiously through the swing-doors.
Jerry had barely returned to the lodging
he shared with Sam in Silver-street, when
he heard a familiar step upon the stair's,
and Mr. Sharp entered, wearing a face of
severity.
“Don’t arst me to console yer, Jerry,” he
said. “I know wot a mess" yer made o’
thin’s. Stolen notes, matey ! Well. I never !”
Mr. Maunder laughed scornfully.
“lou must ’ave ’ad them flop ears o’ yers
glued to key-’oles, as per usual, Sam,” he
retorted, with acerbity. “Bin dodgin’ me
steps the ’ole blessed arternoon, I s’pose.”
Sam sat down on an inverted pickle-case,
and rising in haste, spoke bitterly concern-
ing two-inch nails.
“At this identical moment you gotter
faked cheque, signed ‘John Maxwell,’ fur
fifty quid in yer pocket,” he continued, chaf-
ing himself gingerly. “I see’d John Max-
well, alass Tommy Capp, come outer the
Bank o’ Wot’s-its-name on’y jest now—’e
wos larfin’ as if ’is ’eart ’ud break. I ’ardly
noo ’im in them gold goggles. Clever little
chap, Tommy. ’E were very friendly with
Watty Grimes till lately, as I could ha’ told
yer if you’d on’y demeaned yerself to listen
to me. They ’ad a row over them same
stolen notes as Watty got yer to ’ump to the
bank, ’opin’ you’d git the money fur ’em,
but at the same time fully expectin’ you’d
be run inside ’stead of ’im. Liz was to see
’ow thin’s went, an’ then ’urry back an’ let
’im know in case o’ accidents. Watty’s lyin’
low a bit fur fear o’ the traps—’e’s noo to
the business—an’ Tommy’s persuaded the
rest o’ the push to boycoat the pore feller.
Well, mate, Tommy’d set ’is ’eart op ’avin’
tliem flimsies wot Watty wouldn’t part up
with. It’s no good you shakin’ yer ’ead at
me,;; Jerry. Wot I’m tellin’ yer’s Gawspel
troo. As fur that cheque, best thin’ you
kin do is burn it, else you’ll git jugged,
sure's eggs.”
Choosing his words carefully, Mr. Maun-
der addressed Sam at some length,
“ ’Ush, Jerry,” urged the latter, reproach-
fully! “Don’t make use o’ them disgustin’
expressions. You’ve on’y yerself to thank.
Why wouldn’t you take my advice, matey?
There’s pore copper-nob stan,din’ outside o’
the bank waitin’ on yer as patent aS a monu-
ment. Go back immediate an’ tell ’er ’ow
sorry you are you lost them notes to ole
Tommy Capp, bec,os you badly wanted ’em
yerself, Let’s ’ave a look at that val’able
dockiment ’arf a jiffy.”
After closely scrutinising the cheque, Mr.
Sharp tore it into minute fragments.
“I’ve saved yer fur the nine ’undered an’
ninety-ninth time, Jerry,” he declared. “Why
don’t yer thank me kindly Istead o’ standin’
there with a face as black as them ole boots
o’ yers oughter be?”
Mr, Maunder’s response was to produce a
piece of dirty paper screwed into cocked-hat
shape.
“I picked this up orf the floor when ’e
wos writin’ the cheque,” he explained, in
strangled tones; “it fell outer ’is pocket.
Addressed William Joseph, Malcolm-street—-
’ere, read it.”
“Bill Joseph?” commented Mr. Sharp, as
he untwisted the note; “I dunno ’im ’cept
be ’earsay. Broke-down pug, ’e is—a fence,
same as Ikey Cohen. Let’s see wot Tommy’s
gotter. say to Bill Joseph. ‘Dear Bill, —
This is to introduce young Watty Grimes,
the bloke I was telling you of the other day.
Give him all I owe him. and take a receipt
in full. See you the end of the Aveek. The
traps are out, so I’m in fancy-dress. Tom
Capp.’ ”
There s sometliink in this, Jerry,” re-
marked Sam, meditatively. “An idea’s sim-
perin’ in me brain. You’ve played yer ’and
an lost. Now it’s my turn. I’m Watty
Grimes, orf to call on Bill Joseph, twig?
Wotever I git you shall ’ave one ’arf of,
Jerry. I couldn’t say fairer, could I?”
Mr. Maunder nodded sullenly.
“None o’ yer funny tricks,, mind, Sam,”
lie said warningly. “It wouldn’t be the tirst
time, nor the second neither, you’ve mistook
the ’ole fur yer ’arf.”
Mr. Sharp ignored the insinuation. “You
carn’t stir out yer self, Jerry,” he hastened to
remind his aged friend. “Think o’ that pore
gurl you bilked. S’posin’ you was to meet
’er in the streets, you wouldn’t be able to
look in ’er luverly face, matey. No, no, you
stop ’ere snug while I run roun’ to Malcolm-
street. So long.”
For nearly an hour Mr. Maunder kept an
enforced retirement. At last, however, the
door opened, and Sam stood on the threshold,
breathless and hatless. His whole appear-
ance was a study in dilapidation.
“Why, wotever ’ave you bin doin’ of,
Sam?” inquired Jerry, in blank amazement.
“Drinkin’ someone else’s beer accident’ly fur
the purpose?”
Mr. Sharp sank exhausted on the pickle-case.
“I b’lieve you noo it orl the time, an’ let
me go outer wicked malice. I wouldn’t ha’
thought it o’ you, Jerry. I’m that crool
sore I kin ’ardly set down,” he gasped, his
head buried in his hands.
“Well, don’t set down —stan’ up,” advised
Mr. Maunder. “It’s my candied ’pinion yer
the worse fur licker, Sam. Where yer bin
fur the larst hour, might I kindly arst?”
“Drunk!” ejaculated the indignant Mr.
Sharp. “Drunk! My Gawd, I on’y wish I
was! Listen to this, you ungrateful croco-
dile. I went round to Maleolm-street, No.
13, and knocked at the door. A big, ugly-
lookin’ bloke, with a face like a muffin, orl
over little ’oles, come out an’ fixes me with
’is coal-blue eye. I give ’irh the note, an’ ’e
reads it through very careful. ‘So yer

nasty-like, ‘yer the man wot’s bin tryin’ to

an’ I’m goin’ to learn yer sech a lesson yer

“ ’E must ha’ hit yer below the belt, Sam,”
interpolated Mr. Maunder.
“But ’im ’oo larfs longest larfs the best,”
continued Mr. Sharp,- firmly. “Jest as ’e
feinted”
“Don’t wonder, arter bein’ in the same
room along o’ you fur ’arf a hour,” said Mr.
Maunder, with acidity. “I feels that way
meself, orfen an’ orfen.”
“Shut yer fat ’ead. .Test as ’e feinted,”
repeated the bellicose Mr. Sharp, “I ducked
an’ slung in me right, catchin’ ’im fair on
the p’int.”
“Wot you don’t know about pints ain’t
worth knowin,” put in the malignant Jerry.
“ ’Ee wos out to the world,” pursued the
Homeric Sam, disdaining retort; “an’ when

smilin’ pitiful orl over ’is pore, bruised face,
‘that I’ve bin wopped be a better man than
’isself, an’_nex’ time ’e wants 'is dirty work
done fur ’im, let ’im sally ’is own ’ands a-

Mr. Maunder laughed rudely.
“You’d dirty anybody’s ’ands, Sam,” he
said, with candor. “I’m glad to ’ear Big—
meantersay Bill Joseph’s so partic’lar. If
I’d bin ’im, though. I’d er marked that ugly
face o’ yers, on’y I s’pose its so wooden ’e
couldn’t make no impression on it.”
“One moment, Jerry, if you please,” en-
treated the punctilious Mr. Sharp. “A ’arf
o’ wot Bill give me is yers be rights. I’ll
pass it on at once, afore I furgit ’ow ’ard ’e
’it.” He rose briskly, and proceeded to
divest himself of his jacket.
Mr. Maunder interposed hastily.
“Don’t be a fool, Sam,” he requested.
“Yer -welcome to keep the lot —I ain’t one o’
them graspin' greedy sort.”
Mr. Sharp; grinned.
“Orl right, Jerrv, I’ll keep it fur yer, to
be. repaid some other time. Now, seein’ as
neither o’ us ’as gotter bean, I’m goin’ roun’
to Ikey’s td%ry if I carnt touch ’im fur jest

I mustn’t arst you to come too", but there’s
Carrots to think of —I met ’er at the end o’
Maleolm-street 10 minutes back, an’ she were

wot my feelin’s ’ud be if I was to ’ear ypu’fl

He drew forth a handkerchief with a
flourish, and as he did so half a dozen sover-
eigns tinkled on the floor.
As Sam stooped hurriedly to i-ecover his
scattered treasure, Jerry, suddenly enlight-
ened. raised an accusatory voice.
“You’ve been deceivin’ ine, Sam; it ain’t
no use denyin’ it. You nevepVad no scrap
with Bill Joseph. You cadged 'them thick-
uns outer ’im some’ow. You’ve bin tellin’

Mr. Sharp rose erect, and the ghost of a
blush mantled his ingenuous countenance.
“P’raps arter orl yer better come an’ ’elp

subdued accents. “I ’spect Carroty Liz ’as

A LAY OF DEVILS
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
WHEN the devils sport at eventide
At Sunset-by-the-Sea,
The waves are still, and the airs are chill,
And the sands are wide and free;
There’s a devil for Tom, and a devil for Jane,
And a brace of devils for me.
Tom’s a lazy devil, I ween,
He loves to lie at ease
While the smoke wreaths curl around the girt
Whose arm is across his knees;
Oh, my twin devils mock and scorn
Such idle tricks as these!
Jane’s devil wears a subtle smile
As he whispers in her ear
The lingering bliss of a lawless kiss
When ho one else is near;
And both my devils snort like Hell,
And splutter, pnd hiss, and jeer.
Yes, they have only a devil apiece,
The man and the winsome maid,
While I walk with two, and their breath is blue
As the tint of the brimstone shade;
But the devil of Jane is surely Tom,
Alack, that it should be said.
And at eve, in Sunset-by-the-Sea,
When the lights begin to wane,
Hand in hand on the darkening strand
I walk with my devils twain;
And I know, Ah, none so well as I,
That Tom's own devil is Jane.
If only the devil of Tom were mine,
Or Jane were the devil of me,
Dr I, to be plain, were the devil of Jane,
How fair were the darkening sea,
With the devils that prance on the evening sand
Reduoed at least by three.
For out of the devils that prance and rear
On the maze of the sobbing tide,
My special two that obscure the view.
And that will not be denied,
Are the fiends of envy of Tom’s good luck,
And desire for the girl beside*
And still, I suppose, if it yet might hap
That Jane had a smile for me,
The fiends I keep wouldn’t go to sleep
In Sunset-by-the-Sea,
They’d then be found at the twilight hour
In Tom’s menagerie.
So I walk at eve on the darkening strand
In the midst of my devils twain,
And they prance and rear when they come a-near
The spot of their birth and pain—
The spot that is occupied by Tom
Accompanied by Jane.
But if only the devil of Tom were mine.
Or Jane were the devil of me,
Or I, to be plain, were the devil of Jane.
Then mine were the joy of three,
If the balance of devils accompanied Tom
In Sunset-by-the-Sea.

The Trouble on the “Clarion.”
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
THE General Manager of the Daily
Clarion sat back in his chair,
puffed out his cheeks, and blew
through his whiskers. He was a Godly man
had he been otherwise he would
have sworn through them. He had received
a shock. He had discovered that the staff
was discontented. That this was the inevit-
able result of his blundering, bullying treat-
ment of the men he had not yet discovered,
for the General Manager of the Clarion
prided himself more on his capacity for com-
mand than on his grip upon the ledger. Just
as Henry. Tarkes thought more of his verse
than of his statesmanship, or Senator Neild
preferred the one line—“Eftsoons a nocent
waterspout”—to the imperial glory of his
moustache. Great minds all have their aber-
rations.
The General Manager was once a very,
very small dog in the Clarion office. In
those days of subservience, and of the
adding-up of interminable figures behind the
plate-glass partition which trembled at the
roar of the big machines in the basement,
he had looked up to the reporters as bril-
liant, clever, worldly-wise fellows upon
whom the paper, and, consequently, his own
small salary, depended. He had even called
them sir.” Thank God, he had climbed
above that sort of thing now; climbed above
the reporters, above the editor, even, and
was answerable only to the proprietors, and
they required nothing more than a large
yearly dividend, and left the getting of it
to him. Yes, he was quite a big dog now,
and felt every inch of his bigness.
So the staff was discontented, was it?
What disgusting ingratitude! Was he not
paying enormous salaries?— two men were
earning the fabulous wage of £250 a year.
It was too much to pay any reporter. He
had an idea that you can take any sort of
human object, and make a reporter of it by
teaching it 1 itman, and sending it round
after paragraphs. It is not an uncommon
mistake among people like the General Man-
ager, who have never been reporters. It
was partly for this reason, and partly for
the sake of cheapness, that he had got into
the habit of engaging “juniors,” at from
255. to 30s. a week.
So far, this system had led to nothing
but trouble. First of all, you cannot expect
a boy of 20, pitchforked into an assignment
which requires a deep knowledge of politics
and the tact of a head-waiter, as well as
the ability to write decent English, to get
the news that is available to a man who
has put in many years in learning these
things. Secondly, one must consider libels.
A boy of 20 does not always realise the
importance of keeping a discriminating eye
upon the names of plaintiff and defendant.
And if one is only 20, and has three girls,
and 255. a week with which to buy them
chocolates, it is so fatally easy to mix up
qames on a charge-sheet. Especially when
one has to go from 3 o’clock in the after-
noon to 3 next morning upon the “rounds,”
and “pick up” three or four minor meetings
and concerts in between times. And though
any journalist knows the danger of turning
a cub loose to “pick up” police-court news,
the. Clarion system, which expected each
of its juniors to be in three places at once,
forced this slovenly expedient on them, and
bred numberless harassing little libels.
Beside these troubles was the continual
“scooping” of the Clarion by its reptile
contemporary round the corner. That this
was the natural result of the “junior” sys-
tem the news-editor knew. So did every-
body in the office but the General Manager.
The Echo employed older men, and paid
them decent salaries. The Echo men were,
for the most part, married, and that made
them careful. And, whenever the Clarion
showed signs of having trained a smart
junior, the Echo bought him just as he was
beginning his usefulness. It was rarely
indeed that an Echo man was discharged,
for the paper had a name for keeping its
men. On the other hand, the Clarion
manager sacked a junior once a month or
so. But it was very little satisfaction to
discharge a cheap junior, because) as a rule,
he did not mind it in the leass. The last
one who had been thus dealt with had
spoiled the ceremony by telling the General
Manager all that was in his heart about
the great man’s personal appearance and
habits, appending a brief but vivid sketch
of what would inevitably happen to him
after the affairs of the paper had worried
him into his grave.
But the worst of the juniors had been
weeded out, and the Clarion had a set of
cubs who promised a good staff —and a
cheap one—in two or three years. This
very morning the boys had put up two un-
deniable scoops on the Echo, and the Gen-
eral Manager had been congratulating him-
self upon this almost unprecedented thing,
when a small but determined deputation of
two broke in upon his satisfaction.
Smithers, who was getting £2 a week for
(2 hours’ work upon the “rounds,” had re-
ceived an offer of a better position on the
Echo. Derham, who put in 80 hours on
“Departments” and in “the Gallery,” had an
opportunity of showing his skill as a sub-
editor on the Globe, an evening paper which
lifted all its over-night news (there was a
black suspicion about its cables, too) from
the morning journals, thus giving its report-
ing staff a chance of taking its wife to the
theatre at night. But Derham looked with
the scorn of a morning-paper reporter upon
the Globe and all its ways. Still, he could
use it as a pistol. And so both he and
Smithers came to the General Manager to
wrench out a rise in salary. - It was well
known that this was the only way to get
such a thing on the Clarion. The General
Manager had successfully suppressed a wild
desire to tell them to go to Sheol, and had
at last promised them three-fourths of what
they demanded. The paper had lost many
other young men just as they became useful,
and he was sick of the growling of the news-
editor at having continually to train fresh
cubs.
And, on top of this, the news-editor had
come in and told him that Addison, the star
reporter, was in the sulks because he, the
manager, had brought in a newsman from
the country to edit-the agricultural section,
when Addison had looked for the position
himself. That was why the General Man-
ager was angry, and blew into His whiskers.
The staff was discontented, was it? Well, if
so, it knew what to do, he informed the
news-editor.
As he meditated, the sub-editor came in
with the morning’s issue. The new shipping
junior had distinguished himself. The Customs-
clerks, scenting something ineffably green,
had filled up that unfortunate young man
with the story of a barque which had arrived
with a consignment of post-holes? and mixed
cargo, and had left with a cargo of cocoa-
nuts and pearl-shell for the *■’ Solomons.
Three captains and two shipping agents had
been up during the morning, and had
sci’eamed with mirth all over,the sub.’s room.
One captain, who. was a cluF-mate of the
most influential of the propi’ietors, had
shoved the paper under this great man’s
nose, and had told him that when he, upon
his last voyage, had taken a cai-go of
coals to Newcastle, the paper hadn’t
reported it. And one only had to mention
cocoanuts in the club-room to lose the friend-
ship of that proprietor. The General Mana-
ger took a bold and original step. He called
the shipping junior and gave him a week’s
notice.
And it was that very morning that the
cheap new cable expert had got a cable
about some troubles in Greece, and had mis-
taken them for a fall in the grease market,
whatever that might be; and had inter-
preted a political assassination at Florence
as something about -a young woman of that
name. He read the comic papers, and un-
THE COMING SUNDOWNER.
derstood that a certain variety of woman
was commonly called Florence, or else
Flossie. He took chances, and called her
Flossie. He also said, in a reckless moment,
that she wasn’t really dead, and charged the
attack on her to the Social Purity Society.
Perhaps, but for this error and that of the
shipping junior, the General Manager would
not have done what he did. But he walked
blindly into destruction when, his temper
overcoming his discretion, he broke faith
with Derham and'Smithers. The result was
that, when these two interviewed the ac-
countant at the end of the week, Smithers
found the usual two sovereigns gazing up
at him from the counter, and Derham’s
£3 10s. bad not increased. “What’s this?”
inquired Derham.
The accountant sucked his teeth.
“What’s this?” inquired Smithers.
“If you don’t want it, gentlemen,” replied
the accountant, “you might give it to me.”
“I’ll leave mine! till to-morrow,” said Der-
ham ; and Smithers, although he badly
wanted to take a girl to the theatre that
night, said he would leave his too.
They went to the General Manager, who,
to exhibit his dignity, kept them waiting
half an hour outside his door. When they
got in they asked mildly for ah explanation.
Of course, he had forgotten?
He was very decisive upon the point. He
had not forgotten—he considered that they
were amply paid—amply. He would not
suffer this “stand and deliver” attitude. If
they considered themselves unfairly dealt
with, they might take those very desirable
positions of which they had told him. He
hinted that the whole story of outside offers
was a lie, and concluded by asking them to
shut the door. He felt like Napoleon, and
admired his own astuteness immensely.
Derham and Smithers looked fixedly at him
till he dropped his eyes, and then they walked
silently from the room.
They knew what the General Manager
had guessed, that the two positions had been
filled. And before evening the whole office
had heard the story, and somebody ha*d
hooted the General Manager as he left the
building. He turned round savagely to
catch the concentrated gaze of half a dozen
of the staff, opened his lips as though to
speak, thought better of it. and pounded
down the stairs in a black fury. As he got
to the street he heard it again, “Boo—ooh!”
Blind with wrath, he missed the last step,
and his hat flew off, bounding through the
office into the street, where a ragged urchin
kicked it joyously into the gutter, amid the
cheers of the group on top of the stairs.
That night a meeting was held in the re-
porters’ room, where several interesting reso-
lutions were carried. A copy-boy who was
caught with his ear to the keyhole was
kicked very severely, and went blubbering to
the General Manager (who had sent him)
only to be kicked some more. The news-
editor knew what the trouble was, because
the General Manager had proudly, told him
how he had dealt with this “damned
mutiny.'’ And so the news-editor sat
gloomily over a bundle of proofs, wondering
what was going to hit the paper. A strike
was the last thing he feared—it would be
something worse than that. The men had
been addressing him as “sir” all the evening,
and then only when he had spoken to them
first. After the meeting they filed in
silently, one by one, signed the duty-book,
and departed. The roaring presses awoke
at half-past 1, and, taking out a sheet of
copy-paper, the news-editor wrote out a
rough draft of his letter of resignation. He
locked it carefully in his desk as a boy came
in with the paper. Then he rose, stumbled
over the waste-paper basket, kicked it sav-
agely to the other end of the room, jammed
on his hat, and went home. As he walked
through the deserted streets, he thought of his
wife and children, his bank-balance, and his
prospects of staff-work on another paper.
Then he damned the General Manager, and
hoped he would be able to keep his hands off
him when the time came.
Yet the work of the paper went on
smoothly next day. The men seemed in good
temper, and dug out news in ap amazing
way. It is true that the copy-bby who had
been kicked heard Addison, the leader of
the Gallery staff, and the shipping junior,
who was to leave next day, discussing
some judgment of the Marine Court in a
way that would have interested the General
Manager.
“To make certain,” Addison was saying as
the boy came upon them, “just chuck in a
few caustic remarks by the president upon
the skipper’s sobriety and seamanship. It’ll
make better reading, and, besides, the paper
can’t crawl out then.”
Being a copy-boy, the listener was not
interested.
Late at night, the news-editor called the
roundsman in, and pointed to ; a half-column
describing the arrest, half an hour before, of
a prominent citizen on a charge of bigamy.
“I s’pose this is all*right?” he asked, doubt-
fully. “It seems too good to be true!”
Smithers vouched for it. But the news-
editor was not satisfied. Smithers was
young and irresponsible. So he sent Addi-
son up to the police station to verify it, and
Addison came back with a line half-column
interview with' the wronged wife, all tears
and forgiveness, and another with the
brother of the second lady, in which the
words “hound” and “horse-whipping” oc-
curred quite a number of times. And when
Addison casually mentioned that the Echo
roundsman had fallen down on the whole
story, the news-editor set it up in glaring
blacks. If he had been able to set it
in red he would have done it. A noble
scoop like this was not an everyday affair
to the Clarion.
The Parliamentary staff brought in an
account of a disgraceful scene in the House,
in which seven members were “named,”
and two, after rolling upon the floor before
the Speaker, biting each other as they rolled,
had been forcibly removed, using the most
disgusting language, by the Sergeant-at
Arms and three policemen. From Depart-
ments came a tale of low jobbery in high
places, inculpating a Minister and several
big shipping firms. “You had this from the
Chief Secretary V” asked the news-editor,
and Derham said he had, and from the
Premier too.
“That’s good enough,” the news-editor
declared. “Neither of them \y,puld let the
Clarion down.” And so a scathing leader
was written upon the subject by the
Clarion’s youngest and most vituperative
leader writer.
Even the Church produced a mild sensa-
tion that day. The copy-boy who had been
kicked overheard another conversation at 10
o’clock.
“The Reverend William* Meeks, lecturing
last night upon ‘Divine Forbearance,’ ” read
one of the juniors to Addison, “said that
upon study of the Scriptures, any broad-
minded churchman must come to the conclu-
sion that Divine forbearance was a thing
conspicuous in Heaven by its absence. It
was frequently found amongst men, but
never in the place where it might naturally
be expected. A God wdio visited the sins of
the father upon the third and fourth genera-
tion, who hardened Pharaoh’s heart and
then smote him with boils, and the death of
the firstborn of Egypt, could neither pride
Himself upon His justice nor His me rev.
Omar had nailed this lie of forbearance to
the table when he wrote:—
O Thou, who Man of baser Earth didst make,
And Even with Paradise devised the Snake;
For all the Sin with which the face of Man
Is blackened, Man’s Forgiveness give—and take!”
“The Reverend William must have been
mad,” was Addison’s comment.
P e ma d to-morrow,” replied the
junior. File this for me, old chap, will
3 oik 1 m atraid to face the sub. with it.”
i -l-h e copy-boy picked out a piece of well-
cliewed gum from his trousers pocket. Reli-
gious controversy bored him. .But when the
man who did the Divorce Court came in and
gave Addison the spicy details of a case he
had taken in to the news-editor, the boy’s
jaws stoppeu working, and he envied’ these
reporters to whom the policemen on guard
outside the place of broken marriages opened
wide the door.
“Good Lord!” said Addison. “It’ll be an
interesting paper to-morrow—every cross-
head a scoop !”
The Divorce Court man scratched his
nose. “Booked your passage, Addy?”
“What do you think?”
“I’d like to see the old man’s face when
they begin to come in. But one has to
deny oneself something. Good-night, Addy.”
They shook hands solemnly. “See you
some time or other,” said the star reporter.
All of which conveyed nothing to the copy-
boy who had been kicked.
To nobody was the paper more interesting
than to the General Manager. Fvery cross-
head was a scoop, as Addison had said. As
the General Manager looked scornfully
through the bald pages of the Echo, he felt that
at last the Clarion had a staff of which he
could be justly proud. He put this new
activity down to his own decisive methods.
With the paper in his hand, he went into
his club, and there caught Enderby, a stout
lawyer, just leaving. He pushed Enderby
back into his chair and rang for drinks. He
bragged about his staff, flourishing his paper-
ful of scoops. “Never saw a paper so badly
beaten as the Echo to-day, Enderby,” he
said.
“The trouble about this so-called ‘brilliant’
journalism,” said Enderby, slowly, “is that
it’s bound to hurt somebody, and that some-
body is bound to squeal. And your brilliant
young reporter at 20s. a week is apt to fake
his story. Amongst your lists of scoops, for
instance, you mentioned the ; Marine Court
finding in respect to the Althea wreck. Now
that report has hurt the skipper of the Al-
thea very badly, and the worst of it is that
it is a totally inaccurate' report. Far from
condemning the old boy, the President of the
Court complimented him upon his skill and
courage, and discharged him from the in-
quiry without a stain on his ticket, and his
firm has already given him another com-
mand. Captain Bluenose, finding himself
grossly libelled, came to me. Here is the
writ.” He pushed a paper over to the
dazed General Manager, and rose to leave.
“It is for £2OOO, you will observe —and I
think he will get every penny of it. Take
my advice, and sack every boy on your staff,
and get good, responsible men at decent
screws.”
The General Manager bounced up the
office stairs 10 minutes later in a state of
frenzy. He called for the shipping junior
and was informed that he had drawn his
pittance and departed, having been sacked
by the General Manager himself a week
ago. Then he went into his office, to find
on his table two lawyers’ letters on behalf
of two well-known and respected burglars
whose luck had stood them in well at yester-
day’s police-court proceedings, in despite that
the Clarion had reported: “The accused,
who both pleaded guilty, were committed for
trial.” It would cost at least £2OO to square
that. And, as the frantic General Manager
rang the bell for the sub-editor, another
lawyer dropped in to discuss the matter of a
prominent citizen’s hurt feelings. It would
hurt anybody’s feelings to have it printed in
a respectable paper like the Clarion that
he had been arrested for bigamy, and this
lawyer’s client was damaged to the extent of
£2500, a very moderate estimate when one
considers it. And no sooner had the Gentle-
man One departed, than another arrived on
behalf of the Rev. Meeks, who had “read
with pain” that he was reported in the
Clarion as “having satirised a subject
which was very holy” to him. His pain,
however, was nothing to the General Man-
ager’s.
By 6 o’clock that evening writs were in
for £16,000, and even then the two politi-
cians who were alleged to have bitten each
other had not been heard from. Very likely
they were still adding up the bill. None of
the offending reporters had yet been in, and
as it became apparent that they would not
be in any more, the city was scoured for
casual hands to assist the sub-editors to
bring out next day’s issue. As a matter of
fact, Derharn and Smithers had left for
America, and Addison for the Cape. The
shipping junior had sought refuge at Perth,
and the Church and Law-court reporters
were in hiding, waiting for the boat to Java.
They were tired of newspaper work, they
said, and were going to grow rubber. The
news-editor had put in his resignation, giv-
ing his reasons to the Board of Directors by
letter, and to the General Manager by word
of mouth —-the nastiest word he could find.
“You, too.” he concluded, “are sure to be
sacked over this, and it serves you damned
well right. And when you look frr a new
billet, let it be away from a newspaner office.
Say a gaol. You’d have made a first-class
warder. You’ve handled my staff here as though
it was a chain gang, and I’m glad, for the
sake of journalism, that it has done what it
has done.”
The news-editor’s letter of resignation
was read at the next meeting of the Board,
and, after a long discussion, it was decided
that he be requested to withdraw it, and
that the General Manager be asked to for-
ward one in its place. So the General
Manager resigned, and. as he walked down
the office steps for the last time, he met the
news-editor coming up them. “Back to the
old kennel!” he sneered. “Dang to read
copy, or take a sweeper’s job?”
“A sweeper’s job it is,” answered the
news-editor. “You’ve left a deal to clean
up. Got that wardership yet?”
He passed up the steps to his new office.
And he swept so clean that now there is no
joy for an Echo roundsman or depart-
mental reporter in scooping his fellow of the
Clarion. Because the men on the Clarion,
being men of their hands, and valuing their
paper and their salary, will lot him bak
good and hard. So the roundsmen walk
from the hospital to the police court, and
down to the morgue together, and the men
on “Departments” swan notes in the cor-
ridor outside the Chief Secretary’s office,
and all is peace.

His Sorrowing Letter to Honoria.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
YOU tell me, child (I’ve kissed the paper
twice,
And twice a hundred times, perhaps,
and more)
You tell me I have filched away your dream,
And spoilt the sweetest of your memories,
And made your honey gall, and slain your
faith
Irresolute in man (which means in me),
And fouled day’s splendor with a hideous
stain,
And torn away the ecstasies of the night,
And done a thousand other things that show
I am a very heretic and love
As men love, for a day—and then forget.
True, you are not so wordy ; but you say,
With here a word and there a hinting
phrase,
And twenty million plaints between the
lines,
Something like that. It’s sweet of you to
write
Such things to me. You cannot then forget?
Thank God for that! When you forget, I’ll
cry
Derision of all goodness, and I’ll know
The gods are dead and carrion, and I’ll slay
My every faint ideal till the reek
Of all that poor corruption shames the sky
And turns the stars to offal. You forget!
When you forget, I will forget my name,
And swear no fool so piteous ever breathed.
When you forget, I’ll fling my very soul
Dor swine to nose at. Dear, when you
forget,
The world will be forgotten, and cold space
Will ring with one damned last most deso-
late cry
That God is dead ! You never can forget.
And now, life’s sweetness, coming back
again
To your dear letter (which my thoughts
have kissed,
My holiest thoughts, each thought a thou-
sand times)—
Deferring to that letter, lady mine
Who will not be my lady, what shall I
Say in defence —I, who am at this point
A heretic (wasn’t it?) by Love forsworn?
Item. You’ve found that on a time —last
week,
Last month, last year, or years and years
ago—
-1 kissed a Certain Damsel. (I suppose
That I did kiss the damsel? Kindly state.
’Twer" shame to leave such damsels all un-
kist
Beneatn the expectations of the moon.)
I kissed a damsel. You don’t name the jade.
’Twas wrong of you. Such damsels should
he named.
You leave me in a fog. How shall I say
Which damsel ’twas 1 kissed, or how decide
Which crime I’m being tried for? Oh, tut,
tut,
To leave a man in such a sorry plight!
If I confess that Circe once 1 kissed
Devoutly on her little tapering chin,
Or on her sleek, soft, golden neck, low down
Where the demurest, wickedest dimples are,
And then it prove that she you hear I kissed
Was that lithe wench Astarte, where am I?
Or if I plead (ah, lady, pity me!)
That on a day 1 met Campaspe shy
Upon a mead bedecked with flowers and
things—•
.Poppies and cowslips and anemones
And aphrodisiac mushrooms, and such trash.
O youth grown ripe l O spring to autumn
bloomed !
If 1 should plead that I Campaspe met,
And straightway kissed her in the space be-
tween
The exquisite marvels of her cornflower eyes,
And urge as my excuse 1 did the thing
Because she seemed so innocent, and so
Unconsciously athirst for kisses—well,
If X say this, and you retort that you
Heard'that I kissed a dairymaid or so
For very naughtiness on a day in June,
Here I "shall be mine own accuser. Come!
It isn't fair —you know it isn’t fair.
Produce your damsel. Send her photograph.
Tell me her age and height. Say when and
where
I did commit this crime detestable.
Help my poor fading memory to bring back
The several details of the accident.
And straightway, with my hand upon my
heart
(That overdriven, dolorous, decent dog!),
And penitence all a-bristle in my hair,
111 cry, “Oh, sorry me! I own I kissed,
Being dazed or drunken, this astounding girl,
Who dared to let me do so ill a thing.”
Then you, from out the sweetness of your
store
Of sweetness utterly quintessentialised,
0 lady, dear, my lady! you will say,
“To err is human. I forgive you, boy.
1 will not grudge your failing memory of
A trifle soon forgotten. Nay, I’ll be
A lady worth your loving. I will give
You such a kiss as shall for ever more
Cure you of the desire of kisses such
As dairymaids on sunny days of June
Fling broadcast o’er the meadows —eh, the
darned
Red clover, daisies, buttercups and things!-—■
, Chuck right across creation to ensnare
The feet of truly modest gentlemen.”
Thus shall you say, dear lady of my
dreams,
Who know men so, and are so merciful.
So, dear, I’ve answered you; and now I
wait,
AH meekly, for the name and photograph,
The needed details. Ten to one, I’ll prove
I never kissed the girl at all, nor sought
To kiss her, but by her was caught and
kissed,
And did so blush at the amazing thing,
That straight 1 drove her from, my memory
As all unworthy of my thoughts of you.
P.S. —The world’s so full of prowling misses,
It’s difficult at times to dodge their kisses.
Hence, if you'd keep your lover staunch and
steady,
Have your own kisses always warm and
ready !

[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
A CARD in the shop window notifies the
public that “costumes at lowest possible
rates” are made “within.”
The card is as well known to the hurrying
patrons of the adjacent market as is the row
of limp wrappers which flank it, the
sleeves crossed meekly over the buttons of
the garments in front, as though patiently
warding off a blow.
Hanging in festoons by the yard is lamb’s
fur —a species unknown to sheep breeders—
fur, to be quite candid, grown no further off
than the neighboring blanket mill. Offered
at a reduced figure, it ever awaits a buyer.
Other things there are. Brooches appeal
to the sentiments with inscriptions of “Bet”
or “Mother.” Beari necklaces set their
meshes as a trap for dead flies. A blouse
bears the one expressive word “Rich” upon
its bosom.
The window tended by none, glanced at by
few, is indeed dead—a no-man’s land, where
flies buzz drowsily by day, and a corpulent
mouse riots among the skin-food tablets by
night. But within all is activity.
Behind a partition which forms a work-
room, with a window overlooking the
counter, Miss McQuirk’s employees are toil-
ing nineteen to the dozen. Miss McQuirk is
at the “cutting out” tabic. She is sharp and
raspy. Last Sunday’s application of hair
restorer is wearing off, leaving her coiffure
ringed like a subdued rainbow. A collar sup-
port, broken from its stitching, stabs her
neck cruelly at every turn. She suffers
from chronic exasperation. If for even a
second her shears are mislaid she rends
her hair. A missing “measure” makes her
mad.
Grabbing a roll of lining she slices out a
skirt, and throws it to an improver, with in-
structions unintelligible through being hissed
amid a mouthful of pins. The improver—un-
comprehending-—allows her face to remain a
blank. She is new. . A few days will teach
her the policy, in receiving orders from her
employer, of feigning a lively “grasp.”_ Any-
how, is there not always the chance of picking
up the clue to the mangled instructions from
the other hands? Even should the expected
wink or whispered word be missing for the
moment, “Old McQ.” is sure to be called out
eventually, when all caffs may be let out of
the bag and discussed freely. Even now the
door-bell announces a customer, and the
dressmaker pounces upon her.
“Goo’ morn!” she says. She is interrupted
by the other. “I jus’ called in to arsk your
charge to make my girl a dress,” the other
pants. “I’m jus’gettin’back from the market.”
She indicates a pram full of cabbages,_ in
which a baby is imbedded, that ,leans against
the portal. 'Past the door echoes the cease-
less tread of feet, with a deafening'current,
now coucliant, now rampant, of groaning
wheels. Women go by pushing green stuffs,
and boys dragging rheumatic hand-trucks
loaded with the same verdancy, for it is mar-
ket day. Looking out, the dressmaker moans
NO USE FOR A CORPSE.
BILL (f o r even your Rabbit-O has his tender moments) : “ Fair din bum, I love yer, Mag.
I love yer well enough to bloomin' well die fer yer."
MAG : “ No good ter me, Bill. I want someone who’ll love me well enough ter bloomin'
well work for me ."
WHEN THE TAXI BLEW UP.
THE FARE : “Well, the register's busted , anyhow; and he
won't know how much I owe lump
in her heart. How shall she endure the dust
and din of many market days—the shrill
confidences of women, the rotten carrot of
derision, which, straight from the hand of
boyhood, vaults lightly through the fanlight ,
Her jaded ear again attends the custo .
“Was passin , and thought id arsk yo
charge quite plain she wants it witn a
gathered skirt an’ one o’ them noo sleeves an
no collar l ut a Peter Pan an’ no tucks on’v
braid an’ if you do it reas’nable”
“How old is the girl?” inquires the dress-
maker tartly.
“Oh! She’s on’y little, my youngest. Ihe
first two was”
“Her age?” again the dressmaker.
“Oh! She’ll be IS on the first”——
“Eighteen! Practically a woman, says
Miss McQuirk, “and I should charge her as
such.” The customer, wounded at such ex-
tortion, prepares to go. “Thought you was
reasonable,” she mutters to her cabbages.
“Th’ ticket in the winder says you re cheap,
but I dunno.” „ ,
Miss McQuirk stickling for her profit, and
the customer robustly clinging to the sweat-
ing principles, are inclined to argue—a tact
which is quickly perceived and acted upon
by the hands behind the partition. There is
a lull. Miss Dando, second in command, is
away matching silk; therefore the employees
can relax their labors. “Why this everlast-
ing strenuousness?” they ask themselves.
One trims her nails, one whirrs her machine
at random upon a scrap of cloth the while
she studies a fashion book on her own ac-
count. The apprentice, trying to get an in-
sight into “the fitting,” is stealthily busy
with paper and a tracing wheel. ~
The interview in the shop is cleft by tbs
tempestuous entrance of another client—a
person of knotty appearance, who bursts in-
stantly into a passionate descnption of a
dress she has seen elsewhere. ‘Better malm
mine like it,” she cries. “It loas so pretty.
There was a sort of folded front, cut well to
the figure.” , , ,
“Narrow skirt?” questions the dressmakei,
swallowing an angry yawn. ,
“M’m? Well, ye-s-s-s. Anyhow, it had a
sort of folded front, an’ it was so pretty ~
“One of the new skirts?” again demands
Miss McQuirk. “Was it a hobble?”
“A nobble? Oh, yes; it was a nobble.
Oh, I wouldn’t dream of wearing anything
else. Make it a nobble —about so.
She draws together her faded black, ana
indicates the r smallest amount ot stepping
pace she can do with. The dressmaker,
quite Without bia«. first takes m the client,
knotty appearance as a whole. Ine lee,:
she then considers separately. 1 bey aie
feet which seem to plead for secrecy and tud
raiment. “'Bout yard ’n arf, she sajs
finally. “I shouldn’t advise any less.
“Oh, but I want a nobble—a real obb’e.
not an ’arf an’ ’arf,” objects the client , an
full here — very full ’ere.”. She bunches up
imaginary yards of material upon her chest.
Here she is wise. Nature having treated lie
scurvily in that region, she recognises nei
only hope to lie in fulness, and would a\aii
herself of it. ,
Miss McQuirk almost strangles the vocue-
rating one with her measure, and then, spite-
fully enlarging on the meagre total, agrees
that “fulness” is indispensable.
“I-I-m-n!” she says. “Must be a full
bodice. You’re so”— —
“Frail,” breaks in the client, Snooks L-j
name, with complacence. , ■
“Flat.” finishes the McQuirk, who objects
to having her remarks ended for her I"™ o ’',,
as much as she objects to the gentle ait i
fla “When shall I call to be fitted?’.’ inquires
the knotty Miss Snooks, now being ed.ed
doorwards. “You might measure me •
She holds out a lean arm. Is it endowed
with two elbows, besides several wrn
joints?” the dressmaker asks herself. Ur s
she a victim to optical illusions. Again
surveys the client. . ~ „ , «t
“Fitted.” she mutters in her throat,

any day.” she says aloud.
“Don’t forget the ’obble, sajs Mu-
Snooks. in reminder. , , ~ .
“Verv well. A hobble and a full bodice.
Goo’ morning—call in next week, says tne
costunii&re, with an air of cold finahtj.


“A sort of folded front, it was so pretty,”
anxiously floats back.
Miss McQuirk almost cuts off the client s
heels in her haste to shut the door, and Miss
Snooks finds herself out in the traffic, still in
the descriptive vein, and being run over by a
truckload of turnips. Snorting scornfully,
the coStumihre then flings open the work-
room, scattering accusations, and making
the guilty flinch.
She gives instructions concerning Miss
Snooks’s “’obble.” - “Leave it a good two
yards,” she directs; “the idea of a scarecrow
like that mincing about in a 27-incli skirt.
Her sister-in-law wouldn’t let her wear it if
I did make it. It’s her we’ve got to please
—she’s paying for it. Where is my tracing
wheel? Miss Dando, Miss Gaby, where is
my tracing wheel?” Foaming, she pitches
the medley of snippings and patterns about,
becoming more infuriated each second.
“Where is my”
“Here,” says a quavering treble. The
flushed apprentice produces the missing ar-
ticle from her apron pocket, “It—must
have fell in when I was stooping down for
pins,” she says. The explanation, felt by
all to be a lame one, nevertheless passes.
There is not time for cross-examination.
Without, still the rumbling of the wheels
—the shrillness of women—the dusty whirl-
wind. Within, work 'arid hectoring. The
dressmaker lets her rusty temper have full
vent —she knoweth not the soft word. Let
her profession take the blame. Working
quickly, she chops out skirts all of one
shape. Any individuality the garments are
to possess develops later, when Miss Dando,
the middle woman, takes them in hand.
Miss McQuirk has no use for prevailing
styles. Experience and the shears are her
sheet anchors. In fashion she steers a
middle course —never quite in—never quite
out! -Her customers are mostly hard-worked
women who proclaim loudly their contempt
for extremes of modishness; To any who do
hanker after subtlety of design, Miss
McQuirk points out the cost of their whim.
Have they realised the amount of trimming
required? Do they know what such and such
is per yard? The customer rarely does.
When told, she descends precipitately from
the high horse of her aspirations, thankful
to her informant, and gratefully leaves the
dress scheme to Miss McQuirk’s good taste
and judgment.
In and out of the otherwise dead shop,
women come and go. Some are taken behind
a tottering Japanese screen, and there put
to the torture. The dressmaker, fitting
them hastily, runs pins into their fleshy
parts, stabs them with the scissors, and
beats down ruthlessly any fancies they may
have for the novel or unique. Others come
in merely to ask the current price. Often
a concise statement of the charge, low as it
certainly is, produces in the inquirer a dis-
tinct falling of countenance and a confused
withdrawal from the premises. The
McQuirk’s heart does not fail her on this
account, however. Weil she knows that,
being unable to find lower rates in the four
corners of the city, the inquirer, armed with
a paper parcel, will return.
A woman is in now. She has with her a
weasel-faced child, who climbs the counter and
kicks the woodwork. The mother is a talkative
creature whose desire to confide amounts to a
passion. _ She deluges Miss McQuirk with
family history. Already the dressmaker is
aware of the lady’s husband’s size in under-
shirts —his aunt’s taste for “common” people
—his brutal refusal to purchase a piano for
the weasel-faced one. Miss McQuirk, from
listening protestingly, finds herself becoming
soothed as by a lullaby. The feeling is not
unpleasant. She sways lightly to the other’s
fluency. Her eyes become glazed. Dreamily
she_ calculates on the size of the other’s
brain. Somewhere in her consciousness she
mis stored up some statistics on the subject.
She would like to prove the truth of them,
by exact measurement. By force of habit
she draws from her shoulders her inch tape,
and, all in the interests of science, attempts
to measure the talker’s head. The resultant
scene even the ts~t of Miss Dando finds diffi-
cult to handle. A rumor, thrown at random
among the traffic by the measured one, that
the measurer is addicted to drink, is the
immediate result, rivalled by another that
she is insane.
Back at “cutting out” Miss McQuirk
pitches epithets broadcast. They are ap-
plicable to_ any who wish to appropriate
them. Idiots,” she says, butchering some
cashmere. “Fools! They ought not to be
allowed to live. Tape! Tape! My tape
measure! Where is it—Miss Dando? Mv

ll P ol t Miss Snooks’s silesia lining lying on
the floor, and falls heavily to her knees. At
this, words fail her. With hysterical
screeches, she. regains her feet and plunges
into the interior.
• Bubbling with giggles at the catastrophe
the hands bend oyer their machines. Like
unto strong wine it is to them to see their
boss laid low. Invigorated, they now work
like furies.
the adjacent holy of holies, Miss
McQuirk s bedroom, a muffled tumult reaches
the ear at times. Sandy, the pup, tired of
flirting with a bone, is worrying Sambo, the
old terrier. They wrestle together, biting
growling. “Thud—shuffle —pad, pad-
shuffle, shuffle.” Now Sandy is worrying the
angora mat. Tufts of it cling about his
jaws ; other tufts adhering to his nostrils are
drawn in and out with his every breath.
Sambo, stupid with great age, mistakes the
mat tor a goat he knew many years ago—a
•mat with whom he had a feud. With zeal
he tears his ancient enemy, scattering his
vitals far. Then again to fresh endeavor.
v\ eI K , ss McQuirk, returning to the cutting
or obbles, scatters the wrestlers to the limits
of the yard.
She finds Miss Dando behind the Japanese
screen in conclave with a lady. That
sister-in-law it is to whom the firm must
m P aymeri t.of Miss Snooks’s ’obble.
Built on bow-window lines, the lady is yet
determined. to wear the facsimile of a ball-
gown clinging round a sylph on a fashion-
displayed in the window.
But with your outlines,” persuades Miss
Dando, the tactful, “so rounded, so —so full,
you know, I think really a V —a nice V, of
course would set off your figure better.
Ihe circular cut is so common, is it not?”
But the bow-window lady will have
none of her suggestions. “No, I want a
low neck,” she booms, “like the one on the
tashion plate.”
“It’s your fault for displaying it,” scolds
the dressmaker, in bitter asides to Miss
Dando. “I told you some fool wou’d want
'L A h rench model at my rates! In'fact.
I couldn’t make the thing if I tried, and
that’s being honest. I’m a plain woman, not
a fancy-dress artist.”
“A low neck,” reiterates the lady. “It’s
for the Mare’s ball —-Jackson, you know, the
corn dealer. My ’usban’ canvassed for him,
an’ now he’s Mare lie hasn’t forgot ’is fren’s
—l’ll say that fer Jackson. He sent us our
invite, an’ I want this dress to be just the
thing, d’yer see. Something smart. Low
neck an’ shoulder straps”
Miss McQuirk interrupts. She has been
impatiently looking from the pictured sylph
to the aspirant for social honors.
“Is this the dress you want?” she snaps.
“That’s ’er. I want to look like ’er, all
spangles an’ yards of train. ‘Spare no ex-
pense for Bill Jackson’s ball,’ my ’usban’
says, an’ natclielly”
Miss McQuirk reads extracts: “Taffetas
... .Dead ashes silk. .. . Swathed in London
mist. .. . Cabochons.... Fog-blue violets....
ropes of peafls”—— Angrily she throws the
fashion plate, aside, and, holding her head
hard, probably to keep sanity in it, dashes
away. To linger Would mean the shedding
of blood —a bow-window client the: sacrifice.
Weapons for the deed are not wanting—a
dress stand, an order book. Failing these,
much damage Could be done with a pair .of
scissors. Meanwhile Miss Dando takes the
half-fitted lady into her tender care. At
this juncture, the door opening again ad-
mits the scarecrow who wants “a nobble.”
Miss McQuirk strides forward to know her
pleasure. “After all, I think I’ll have the
bodice made tight,” pants the knotty Miss
Snooks. “I saw one in a window —it was
so pretty—only five guineas done in silk—
mine’s only silketto, I know, but good, mind
you, good. I wouldn’t wear it else. Be-
cause though my brother is married to a
vulgar person, 1 don’t forget we come of a
superior family—and I dress accordin’ to the
position we ought to hold. But any’ow it
was made smooth across the chest. You
might”-—here she whispers and indicates
gracious curves upon her hollow frame.
“Just light ones,” she adds aloud. “Not
vvaddin,’ it gets so ’ot —a bit of something
light just to round”
“Round off your corners,” snarls the dress-
maker, again at her temper’s mercy. “Very
well; tight bodice and a hobble”
“Oh! No! Not an ’obble skirt. I’ve
changed my mind about that. I’d prefer
something floatin’ an’ sawft —something
cloud-like. I saw such a pretty one done
that way. Another thing, my sister-in-law’s
wearing an ’obble. That’s enough for me.
When a common person like her wears
one —! Well, really, what my brother mar-
ried her for baffles me. They do say ’er first
husband sold fish”
“Liar!” The epithet fairly leaps upon
Miss Snooks, making her cower. At the
same moment, a soft zephyr, as though a
passing angel had waved her wings in bene-
diction, envelops Miss McQuirk. But it is
no angel—merely a disturbance in the atmo-
sphere caused by the falling of the Japanese
screen.
“Swoosh swoosh—swoosh.” It comes
forward with a soft, ragg.v sound. Falling
on the McQuirk it pins her to the floor, with
her head stuck through the vitals of a gold
Japanese bird.
“Liar!” Again the epithet sticks its
fangs in the cowering Snooks. The screen
down, behold the maligned sister-in-law once
wedded to a purveyor of fish ! Like an in-
sulted phoenix she rises above her garments.
shaking a muscular fist. With vengeance
writ in capital letters upon her face, she
climbs across Miss McQuirk, who, like some
stringy vegetable in a cucumber frame, still
encumbers the floor, and leaps upon her prey,
“Don’t make a disturbance here,” shouts
the dressmaker, struggling to rise. “Miss
Dando—Miss Gaby—come here and quell the
riot—send for the police-separate them-
get me out of this tangle, or blood will be
shed”
The hands need no urging. Confusion
reigns. _A box of trimmings is upset. Miss
Snooks is seen on all fours. The sister-in-
law’s striped hosiery is much in evidence,
and Sandy the pup joins the game, bearing
in his jaws—Oh, sacrilege!—Miss McQuirk’s
Sunday stays.
AEEROONA.
The Fraud.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
BY cutting down expenses Flo’s pa gave
her a superior education. At seven
years she had Percy Grainger beaten
on the five-finger. At 12 she painted a sun-
flower that didn’t look too much like a cir-
cular saw. Later on she could touch high C
without standing on her toes. The man
next door, who had no soul, used to throw
stones on the roof when Flo got in a few
cadenzas. At IS Flo took a course at a his-
trionic academy. Pretty soon she would
recite “Lasca” on the slightest provocation,
if jon breatned hard Flo took it as appre-
ciation, and got off another. As a natural
corollary Flo got anxious to Appear. She
arranged an amateur production in the
Mechanics’ Institute. As there were not
enough star roles to go round, Flo lost a lot
of friends. To fill the small parts it was
necessary to hand inferior people a shilling.
Bill, who shined the footwear at the Com-
mercial, was one of the professionals. He
was cast as the Parson. Bill didn’t have to
do a thing tut look like first favorite for a
halo and keep his face shut.
Flo had her eye on a young man, who
owned a whole row of Queen Aimes. She
rather fancied the idea of being Mrs. Jones.
So she invited the gentleman with the name
that occupies 22 pages in the directory to
honor the performance with his presence—-
r.s.y.p.
The audience comprised 89 sisters, 52
liarents, 18 brothers, one husband and Mr.
Jones. The tragic denouement wluwe the
missing document is discovered in the'coal-
scuttle was due for the second act. Bill’s
great chance came in here. But he had got
tired standing round in his holy clothes,
looking like an imported bishop. Bill wanted
to liquidate his appearance money. At the
right moment Bill was a non-starter. The
show could not proceed without the parson.
So Flo went out on a search. She knew
nothing in particular about the business, but
being a wise girl she made a shrewd guess,
and drew the prize. She found Bill busy
in his clerical attire, with gaiters, celluloid
neckwear and squash hat. The angelic-
clothed person was bending his ellmv and
lowering pints just as quick as the sweet
girl could do Sandow exercise on the beer-
pump.
As Flo entered she heard the imitation
good man telling a person who wore football
colors in his hat that Sylph was a good
thing for the Derby, and he didn’t mind if
he did. The place was crowded as a draper's
bargain sale. Everyone wanted to get his
eyes on the parson who rolled off improper
language and told blushy stories. Just
about here Mr. Jones had a drought in his
thorax, and was tired of a poor show. On
the way down he met Flo leading Bill back
by the arm. Mr. Jones didn’t know that
Bill was only dressed for the part. He had
no idea that the nice holy clothes covered
a gross deception of sin and beer. All
he saw and cared about was that Flo had a
jiu-jitsu grip of a parson's arm. He decided
at once a worldly person like himself had
Buckley’s. Flo, too, realised the nasty
situation, and colored. To make matters
worse, Mr. Jones stood on the spurious
clergyman’s pet corn. Bill said more blanks
than appear in a Cup sweep. He called Mr.
Jones a vermilion, exploded, condemned-to-
perdition imbecile. When Bill’s vocabulary
ran dry he started over again. Meanwhile,
people coming home from choir practice
were scandalised, and held up their hands
until they tore the clouds and caused heavy
rain. Bill threatened to push Mr. Jones
hard in the countenance. He also proposed
to fracture his store teeth and generally
alter the contour of Mr. Jones’s profile.
Mr. Jones had never before met a man of
religion who blasphemed and used language
calculated to provoke a breach of the peace.
Not being in the joke, he decided to let the
holy business slide in future. This did not
require much will power, for Mr. Jones's
wings had never shown signs of sprouting.
He didn’t think much of Flo’S friend. So he
retreated with that discretion which is the
better half of the substance frequently men-
tioned, and bought sixpence worth of re-
freshment at the alcohol counter. Flo be-
gan to weep, then got. Soon after the show
closed down. The sisters and parents\went
home annoyed. Bill ended up his clerical
career by an argument with a tall policeman.
When he was well enough to come out of
the hospital, Bill got seven days, and had to
pay for the uniform. Flo had to give evi-
dence. Bill lost his job. Flo lost her oppor-
tunity, and Christianity lost Mr. Jones—all
through the histrionic academy and Flo’s
talent.

His hoots are broken, his pants are

Oh ! not with toil on the wharves or roads

But looking for butts to fill his pipe, or stow

He stops and stares at a passing boat, and
mutters : “Well, ain’t that queer !”
While a worried woman runs about with
parcels and says, “Oh,.dear!
I'm sure I heard something drop just now.
Now where can that half-crown be!”
(He keeps his foot on the missing coin, and
looks at the nice blue sea.)
Around the bars where the city men fore-
gather when darkness comes,
He edges in through the swinging doors and
cadges for trifling sums ;
The Whine at the Elbow is Ruin’s ghost,
and few men count it dear
To lay the Horror with silver coin and stifle
its grief with beer.
He lurches out through the swinging doors.
and drifts up the lamp-lit street;
Policemen take scant heed of him when they
see him upon the beat;
No harm docs he to the warehouse locks in,
the doorways where he prowls;
The suburbs far are his danger zone, and his
prey the housewife’s fowls.
He drifts along to the black Domain, where
the swinging golden lights,
Like pawnshop balls, at the Harbor glare
through the drowsy summer nights ;
And there, ’neath a spreading Moreton Bay,
does the cadger lie and smoke,
While the count of Time by the solemn
clocks comes to him stroke by stroke.
The Harbor wide is a lake of glass, and the
shore-lights set all round,
Burn like the candles that light the dead ere
they rest deep underground ;
The squandered years like a pack of ghosts
rise out of their graves and slink
Like prowling dogs through the outcast's
dreams, unless he be doped with drink.
Oh! the grisly thoughts come crowding fast
as the hours of darkness clang
From the white-faced, sleepless clocks afar
that over the city hang,
Warning the one that sits and smokes in the
shade of a twisted tree,
With deep-sunk eyes on the lake of glass
that once was a wind-swept sea.
lie sits and stares at the lake of glass whilst
the great Time demons tell
Their iron beads in shudd’ring tones in the

Man Who Takes His Time!

An Episode in Grease.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
THE Secretary of the Red Kangaroo lane
was a man of ideas, and had in him some
of the stuff of which organisers of great
trusts are made. He was worried to think of the
vast mass of intelligence and inspiration that was
going to waste on the Red Kangaroo fleet. He
lay awake at nights wondering how to make use
of it—how to turn it into producing revenue for
the co.
An inspiration fell on him one night so heavily
as to rouse him from a profound sleep. He
switched on the light, and, although the night was
cold and the bed warm, got out and made a
note. Next morning he got to the office early
and put the thing before the General Manager.
The General was not of the stuff of which great
organisers are made, and he showed a disposition
to snort when the Secretary pointed out the
advantage of offering a reward for suggestions
from the employees.
“ But, Smith, do you really believe these fellows
ever think ? I don’t. If they did think, do you
think they would ever think of thinking for us ? ”
And laboring under the impression he had said a
really smart thing, the great man leaned back and
smiled amiably.
“ It's this way,” said the Secretary. “ A hun-
dred men working on the actual spot have more
chance of seeing ways and means of saving money
than the man who is on the spot only very occa-
sionally. Anyhow, let me try it—if it does no
good, i) can do no harm ! ”
“No, I s’pose not. How do you propose to
word it ?” > -
“ I have a draft with me,” said the Secretary,
holding o’ut a neatly engrossed document, that
looked suspiciously like a District Court writ.
NOTICE.

officers, suggestions for reductions in working ex-
penses, which can be effected without impairing
efficiency. Any employee forwarding a suggestion

By order.
, General Mgr.
“ I believe that we shall reap a whole crop of
most valuable suggestions in a very few months,”
said the Secretary.
“ Very well, stick the thing up and time will
tell,” said the Manager.
One thing to be said about the Secretary was
that he always went straight to the root of the
matter. Even before the trouble was over and
the bad debt was written off, he got hold of the
second cook of the s.s. Boonooloo, sate him down
with a cigar in his face and a pot with a head on
it at his elbow, and demanded particulars.
“The whole thing happened, sir, through a
dirty, ugly feller, by name Jack Gilhillan, who
was spud-peeling his passage to Fremantle. He’d
left his last bean in Melbourne, and was broke.
Ilis face got on me nerves. He used to poke it
in at the port-hole of the galley an’ make it grin :
‘ Oi fale splendid,’ he would say ; ‘ Oi’m drawing
uv a foine big shlice uv the flaming fat-monney
whin we make Fraymantle. Phwat d’ye reckon
it ’ull pan out, Tommy ? ’
“He yapped and yapped about that blessed
fat-money till the boss cook and meself got fair
bilious ; and we began to ask one another why a
bloke who was working his passage should get
any of the fat-money. You know we always used
to deal out the money in Fremantle because we
could get eight bob a tin there ag’inst seven in
Melb. And we had 10 tins saved up from two
round trips that Gilhillan hadn’t worked ; but all
the same, he reckoned he was to stand in for a
share of the whole lot of it.
“ Well, 10 tins at eight bob meant four quid,
which was a quid a-piece for Arty Ivory, the chief
cook, meself, Gilhillan and Crayfish Jimmy, the
reg’lar rouseabout. Arty was in great trouble.
He had a wife in Queensland, and she wanted
money all the time. Spare me days, if I could
think of what she did with the money ; but Arty
useter picture her bein’ stone broke and thrown
out on a cold world, all for the want of a bob or
two. And when he thought of Gilhillan
drawing an equal share of that fat money he went
fairly mad worrying about his wife. He was dead
sure she was starving. The nearer to Fremantle
we got the more he worried, till the night before
we was due he leans over his bunk and sez, sez
he :
“ ‘ Cripes! But I’m thinkin’ terribly of me
poor moneyless missus up in Queensland. Wot
if we collars the bunce ?’ he sez. ‘ Wot ’ud you
say, Tommy, to a double quid each, eh ? ’
“ Well, you know, boss, nobody’s a real blessed
angel—when bein’ the other thing means double
money. So I grunts an endorsement.
“ ‘ Spare me days, wot annorrible row there
will be ! ’ he sez, anxious-like; thinking of how
Gilhillan would go to market.
“ An’ there was annorrible row, to be sure.
But the money was safely stowed away in the post
office when Gilhillan's phiz pushed through the
door :
“‘Where’s me fat-monney?’ he shouted.
‘Blast yous, where s me fat-monney?’ An" he
shook his fist an’ breathed fire an’ brimstone at us.
‘ Roight up the office Oi goes,’ he yells ; ‘ an’ let
’em know phwat thaves they kape aboard the
Boonooloo. Oi’ll tache yous. Oi'm afhter goin’
now ! ’
“ And he went. Half an hour later down
comes Mr. Grayrigg, the Fremantle manager.
He didn’t say much, but the questions he asked
showed us somebody had bin making a suggestion.
Seems that Gilhillan on his way up chewed it
over, saw he had no right to share in all the fat
money, so comes on the other tack. He thinks
of the offer of for suggestions, and up he goes
an’ claims it for pointing out that there was a
powerful lot of fat money in the fleet goin’ into
the pockets of the cooks. Whether he got the
I dunno, but Grayrigg came down an’ in-
quired into the size of the fat business, put it down
on a paper, works it out and sez :
“ ‘ A fleet of 15 steamers, an’ each losing ’bout
255. a week in fat— roughly per month —equal
to about ,£lOOO a year. Good Gawd !’ he sez.
‘ It’s ’orrible- most ’orrible.’
“Nothing happened that trip, excepting the
howls of Gilhillan along the wharf each night till
we started; but next time the Boonooloo got to
Fremantle there was Mr. Grayrigg with two
butchers’ carts waiting to collar the blessed stuff,
He brings along a couple of fellows in blue
aprons, darts down ’midships to the galley and
nails Arty, the head cook, on the spot.
WHERE DAD CAME IN.
DISTINGUISHED PIANIST : “And your fader —does he not sornedimes dake part in dese charming
home concerts of yours—ais Chamber music?”
LADY AMATEUR : “Dad? Oh, yes, sometimes. He kicks the dog to stop his howling!"
J“ ‘ Dripping ! ’ Arty says in his most lofty tone.
. ‘ No, I hain’t got any dripping !’
“ Blit Grayrigg just puts his thumbs inside his
waistcoat:
“ ‘That’ll do,’ he says quietly ; ‘you seem to
forget you are speaking to your manager. Con-
sider your remark null and void, an’ say some-
thing in place of it,’ he sez.
“ ‘ Why,’ Arty sez, humbler-like, ‘ why, of
course, Mr. Grayrigg, you means the fat. I never
thought of calling it the dripping before.’
“ ‘ How many tins ?’ snaps the Manager.
“ ‘ Four, sir,’ sez Arty, sweetly.
“‘Four! Wot, only four? Why, last trip
you had ’ an’ then he shuts up sudden an’
starts humming. After seein’ the stuff into the
cart -he comes back to the galley, curls his
moustache an’ sez politely :
“ ‘ You fellows,’ he sez, ‘ must be more careful
of the dripping—why, the company’s losing hun-
dreds an’ hundreds of pounds per annum by allow-
ing unscrupulous persons to appropriate it; but,
thanks to a suggestion by a very decent man,
that little lapse is going to be rectified sudden-like.
The dripping is to be carefully saved, and at each
:pqrt some person authorised to do so will collect
.it, and, of course, sign for it. These receipts will
be handed in at the end of the ship’s quarter and
checked.’
“ ‘Thecompany means to confiscate what rightly
belongs to the cooks, then ? ’ sez Arty, looking
him in the eye.
“‘You can preserve your own ideas about
that; but kindly do as ordered, or’
“ ‘Get sacked ! ’ sez Arty, quickly. ‘ Thank
you, Mr. Grayrigg. I’ve a wife to keep and a
principle to uphold. I'm sorry we signed on in
Melbourne.’
“ ‘ You can go in 24 hours ! ’ he sez, an’ turns
to me. I shoves out me chest. ‘ An’ me, too,
Mr. Grayrigg?’ I sez.
“Me an’Arty just packs up our knives, an’
nex’ day leaves the ship wot ’ud bin our home for
four years.
“ ’Tis hard on me poor missus ; but we can’t
help wot is otherwise,’ Arty sez.
“Well, Mr. Grayrigg tries his darndest to get
two cooks to take our place ; but no decent, self-
respecting cook wot knew his business ’ud sign on
when they heard the special clause about the
fat ; an’ in the end the Boonooloo left Fremantle
with 80 passengers, an’ on’y the chief steward an’’
two scullery-men to handle the galley. Wotter
time they must have had ! A more howling,
glorious mess there never was before, an’ they
near blew the whole blooming ship right up, an’
when they lined up again at Port Melbourne they
hadn’t any bloomin’fat at all—’cept wot was all
over ’em.
“The fat idea flew about like the blessed
plague, an’ knocked Australian ports all of a heap.
Little crowds of cooks out of work were all over
the wharves, stranded because they couldn’t col-
lect grease. It useter fall overboard or drop into
the fire and burn till there was a stink of burnin’
fat from Townsville to Fremantle. The com-
bined companies’ motter was : ‘ No fat, no work.’
The result was the galleys was filled with blokes
more fit to drive cabs than sea ovens. They
didn’t save any fat ’cause they didn’t know how.
One tin was, I heard, landed at Brisbane, but it
was half cockroaches an’ beetles, an’ a 20-candle-
power rat was fished out, too.
“ Arty an’ me sat tight in Fremantle waiting
developments until we nearly forgot wot food
looked like. Arty had a bad attack of the sor-
rowfuls—his blooming missus cropped up between
every drink.
“‘lt’s no use, Tommy,’ he sez; ‘I often
wonder now how you cohersed me into collaring
the bunce.’
“ This made me wild. ‘Me!’ I sez. ‘Wot
rot ! What are you gulping at ? You was the
blessed means of bringin’ all the trouble about.’
“ ‘Oh, all right, then !’ he sez. ‘lt was me,
then. Alone I did it—every darned thing. I
started it, an’ ’ (bringing his fist on to the bar
with a bang) ‘ I’ll finish it.’
“ ‘ I’ll follow you, Arty,’ I sez, ‘ even if the
cells are a bit damp.’
“ ‘ Listen, Tommy, carefully,’ he sez. ‘ Larst
night, while you was exploring the thruppinny
bar, I was workin’ points. The Taranga sails
to-morrer, an’ the men refuses to go without
cooks. I went up to the office, an’ Grayrigg was
out, so I had a pitch with the clerk —a nice young
feller. Sez he :
“‘You fellers had better give in, ’cause the
companies never will. Only last evening I typed
a letter from Grayrigg to the Head Office, saying
as how he insisted on pursuin’ his policy, an’
how, if necessary, he’d stow away to catch the
cooks wot dumps the fat overboard, an’ have ’em
lugged for malicious destruction of property. ’
“ ‘ So take your cue from that, Tommy, an’
leave the rest to me. Arsk no questions, but
just obey orders—my orders.’
* * * *
“ Nex’ day, we rolls into the office an’ meets
Mr. Grayrigg.
“‘Well,’ he sez, dirty-like, ‘ wot’s your
trouble ? ’
“‘We’ve come, sir, about the Taranga,’ sez
Arty.
“ ‘ Well,’ sez Grayrigg, ‘ wot’s wrong with the
Taranga ? ’
“ ‘ Please, sir, we thought you might want
some good cooks —that's all.’
“ ‘ Not of your sort,’ he sez, quickly. ‘ Wot
erbout the fat ? ’
“ ‘ The fat,’ Arty sez, nearly chokin’, ‘ will be
saved, every drop, and given to a representative
of the company.’
“ ‘Then it's a complete comedown, eh?’ sez
Greyrigg.
“ ‘ I’m starvin’,’ sez Arty, piteously ; ‘me
wife’s starvin’, me children's starvin’, an’ me—me
—me mate’s starvin’. ’
“ ‘ Good !’ sez Grayrigg. ‘ Well, I’ll give you
another charnst. You can sign on immediately.’
“ Then Arty stands back an’ starts fumblin’
his hat an’ standing about. ‘ Mister Grayrigg,’
he sez, ‘ there’s something wrong ’bout the galley
of the Taranga. I’d like you to have a look at it
so as you could arrange for it to be fixed up. It
wastes a terrible lot o’ fat.’
“ ‘ Very well, I’ll be down at —at’
“ ‘ At sailin’ time, so as you can see it when it’s
goin’,’ sez Arty.
“ ‘At sailin’ time,’ sez Mr. Grayrigg.
“ An’he kept his word. Just before we was
due away he comes dowm.
“ ‘Show me your requirements, an’ when you
return they will be attended to.’
“Arty spread hisself something wonderful;
and Grayrigg wrote it all down in his pocket-book,
and then turns to get out of the stuffy hole. But
Arty gives him a push an’ he shot into our own
cabin on to his head, an’ bein’ stunned, lay like a
log.
“ ‘ Look alive,’ sez Arty, pushing him right in
an’ banging the door. He was fumbling to get up
—no doubt he heard the swish of the propeller.
He got a grip of the door and wrenched it back,
came at us like a tiger, an’ nearly bit the thumb
off Arty. But he stopped one under the jaw an’
another between wind and water, an’ the door
was locked on him.
“He started to yell like the son of a gun. We
had to go in and tackle him, and as we downed

him before putting the towel into his mouth he
spluttered :
“ ‘ Gaol for this, you ’ —and then he was into
the bunk and safely trussed up. In quarter of
an hour he was clear of Fremantle harbor.
“‘Wot a treat!’ sez Arty, sucking his
thumb. ‘ He’s stowing away, as he said he
would.’
“ In spite of his thumb, Arty sang all the after-
noon.
“‘Shut up,’ I sez; ‘it’s the cells for this’ ;
but that only made Arty sing the more.
* * * *
“ Poor devil, I was sorry for him. All he got
to eat was fat—fat boiled, braized, baked, roasted,
burned and underdone. Arty called the various
forms by different names ; hut the foundation
and general top and middle was fat all the time.
And when he wasn’t eating with Arty standing
over him he was tied up and gagged.
“ ‘ How long do you intend to keep this up ?’
he inquired with a shiver one day.
“ ‘ Till you’re well agin, Mr. Grayrigg.’
“‘And what am I supposed to be suffering
from ? ’
“‘Fatty degeneration!’ said Arty, slipping
out and locking the door.
Three days of this awful tack at sea made Gray-
rigg realise that, for the time anyhow, he was
beaten badly.
“ ‘ Look here,’ he says, ‘ I’ll reckon that I did
stow away when we make Adelaide, only, for the
love o' Heaven, gimme something to eat.’
“ ‘ Who said you were going off at Adelaide ? ’
demanded Arty. ‘You ain’t at the proper stage
to discuss terms yet, so the treatment goes on
■rigorous. ’
“Then Grayrigg went on another tack. He
used to groan, declaring that it would soon be
over. He would be dead, and then we’d have
something to answer for.
“ ‘ It’s too rough,’ I sez. ‘ Chuck him in a loaf
of bread an some meat, or he’ll peg out. An’ I
■don’t want any dead blokes, even if they are
managers, on my conscience,’ I sez.
“Arty follow'ed me plan, an' that evening he
got a bit steadier.
“ ‘You fellows saved my life w'ith that bread
and meat,’ he sez, quiet-like, ‘ an’ I’m grateful.
I’ll give you me word, which is me bond, to go
ashore quietly at Port Adelaide an’ keep me mouth
shut. Also, while I retain me own position you
fellers will never know the want of a good job.
That’s fair enough, isn’t it ?’
“‘ I told you,’ Arty says later. ‘My treat-
ment is a triumph of modern scientific methods.
After all, he ain’t a bad cuss, an’ by gosh he’s full
of grit.’
* * * *
“At Port Adelaide, which we reached after
■dark, the Water Police comes on board. They
talked to the Old Man first and then searched the
ship.
‘ “ By the lord !’ Arty sez, rushing into the cabin,
‘ the police are after something. Now, remember
your word, ’cause we could have dumped you
overboard easy as anything. You’d better get out
•of here.’
“ ‘ I’ll stay here,’ says Grayrigg, with dignity,
‘ an’ if they come, I’ll not forget me promise.’
“ So we had to leave him, with the door un-
locked, and waited anxiously in the galley. Down
■came the trap.
“ ‘You can go in our cabin,’ says Arty, ‘it’s
■not locked.’
“ The policeman grinned :
“‘Not much use, cook,; we know how all
yous blokes love him.’
“ ‘ Who are you after, anyhow ? ’
“ ‘ Grayrigg, of Fremantle. Disappeared at
the beginning of the week, an’ two thousand of
the company’s brightest and best has gone with
him. They’re very sore about it, and there’s
£2OO to the man wot produces him. Now, I’ll
just take a look in your cabin as a matter of
form.’
“And he poked the door open, stuck his head
inside and sniffed.
“ ‘ Natcherly, not there!’ he remarked, and
started for the deck. I s’pose Grayrigg was hid
under the bunk. We looked at each other.
“ ‘ So Mr. Grayrigg’s what yer call an hem-
bezzler,’ sez Arty with a chuckle. ‘Two hundred
quid—oh, my mother ! 5 And he dives to the
door and locks it.
“ ‘ He’s ours ; apiece, Strike me ! ’
“ He knocked on the door :
“ ‘ Mr. Grayrigg, Tommy an’ I’s going for a
little walk. Don’t be anxious on our account.
The reward’s £2OO, and it’ll buy food for me
wife and kiddies for the nex’ year.’
“ ‘ Ivory, don’t go. I’ll make it to let
me slide.’
“ I just caught Arty in time. He had col-
lapsed.
‘ ‘ * Have you got it about you ? ’ sez Arty,
opening the door ever so slightly.
“ The door flew open. Arty fell back from an
awful right swing on the nose. Grayrigg was
naked, but he had a bundle in one hand. In the
dim light of the alleyway he was an ’orrible sight.
As I saw Arty go down I grabbed him by the
arms.
“ But, good Lord, me hands just slipped oft
him. Arty came to and snatched him by the leg;
his hands slipped too. And then I stopped some-
thing—stars fell in showers, and the steamer deck
flew up and hit me hard, very hard.
“ When I come-to Arty was lying there dead
to the world, with a bulge the size of a pumpkin
on the front of his head, where Grayrigg had
kicked him, for Grayrigg had kept his boots on.
“That, sir, is the last we saw of Grayrigg.
Lord knows where he is now. When we looked
at our hands we understood why we couldn't hold
the brute. He had greased himselt all over.
Then I s’pose he fled into the night with ’is
bundle, an’ dressed himself in some quiet corner
an’ got away. He must have had about 2lb. of
our lawful fat on him when we saw him last.”

[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
FOUR elderly men sat in the red glow of a
comfortable smoking-room and discoursed
on romance, the painted fowl which had
flown from all of them these 20 years. That is,
three of them discoursed, while one, who wore a
somewhat harassed face, mostly listened.
Beegle, his eyes dimmed by reminiscent sym-
pathy—or it might have been alcohol—told of the
little shop-assistant whose idol he had been in the
long ago.
“Gad! how mad she was about me,’- he
mused, with a self-satisfaction which he ineffectually
essayed to hide behind an appearance of remorse-
ful gloom. “I don’t think I shall forget to mv
dying hour the night I told her I was tired, and

And the whilom Don
Juan laughed cynically,
and leant back in a
pleasing reverie anent
the cold-bloodedness
of which he had been
guilty.
Brown, old and
stout, hastened to
take up the bragful
parable. He sup-
plied a treacly nar-
rative of a peerless
creature whom he
had subdued when
in his early t wenties.
She had fair hair,
eyes like a glimpse of
Heaven and so on. It
appeared that she and
Brown were wont to
foregather on certain
rocks by the sea. Brown
gave details of the
rocks; he described the
particular boulder on
which he had kissed the
girl, the wind that was
blowing at the time,
the appearance of the
adjacent ocean, her hat,
the style of incipient
whiskerings he then af-
fected and her wild ad-
oration of the same.
The mature sentimen-
talists listened tolerantly.
Indeed, these tales of
bygone naughtinesses
heartened them. The
pleasures of Remem-
brance are next best to the pleasures of Hope.
Mention of rocks recalled to Jeavons a young
and lovely married woman who had wanted to throw
herself over the cliffs at South Head on his
account. Despair at the rude health of a hus-
band whom she abhorred, coupled with Jeavons’s
aversion from wronging that worthy superfluity,
prompted the scheme. The tragedy was only
averted by the personal attendance of Jeavons, on
the night advertised for the slaughter, at the
lonely public-house on the cliffs near which her
tram stopped. This effort fell a shade flat. The
company was in no mood for moral attitudes. It
felt that Jeavons, in rebuffing the fair amorist,
had shown a lack of spirit unworthy of one of
his then time of life, and it said as much.
Jeavons fell back on a palpably lying story of the
dastardly treatment he had meted out, shortly
after attaining his majority, to an infatuated
young woman in a city tea-shop. Again his
listeners were absorbed. They revelled in re-
miniscences wherein the woman was trusting,
loving, gullible—a plaything and victim in the
hands of strong, capable Man..
Suddenly little Jobson, who had sat absent-
minded and seemingly unsympathetic, unwound
himself and spoke.
“ I had an experience that you might call—er—
romantic once,” he said diffidently.
They were willing to hear. Certainly Jobson
didn’t look it—still one never knew. Weak,
adoring Woman was capable of amazing things
where the dominant male was concerned. Jobson
was encouraged to proceed.
“ It was night-time, years and years ago,” he
said, sadly. “ The wife had gone out, for a
wonder, to see some people, or something, and
left me alone. You know how cursedly jealous
she always has been.” (There were assenting
nods.) “The moon flooded the garden out-
side. The scent of magnolia floated in on the
summer breeze. In a word, it was a night and
hour for sentiment. The warm stillness was
broken by a strident telephone-ring. Feeling I
know not what delicious premonition, I picked
up the receiver. A girl’s voice—one of the
sweetest, I thought, I had ever heard—breathed
my name at the other end.
“ ‘ Hullo ! ’ I said, ingratiatingly. It was banal,
but there was nothing else for it.
“ ‘ls that Mr. Jobson speaking?’ said the voice.
“ ‘ It is,’ I answered, striving to put a world of
passion into my tones.
“ ‘ I know I oughtn’t to’—began the voice, and
trailed away into shy silence. To put it mildly, I
was interested.
“ ‘ Of course you ought to,’ I said, with what I
think was a somewhat taking air of gallantry :
‘ Now, tell me all about it.’
“ ‘ Oh, but Mr. Jobson, you don’t even know
me ! ’
“ I made an appropriate rejoinder.
“ ‘ Besides’ (hopelessly) ‘you mightn’t like me
if you did.’
“ In an impassioned speech I endeavored to dis-
pel this absurd notion.
“‘Tell me,’ I went on, feeling, I own, a
shade foolish, ‘ how you first got interested in
me.’
“ It seemed she had seen me at theatres, about
the town and so on, and a wild longing to know
me had supervened ; then had come this night
when she couldn’t refrain from, at any rate, having
speech with me, if it was only over a telephone.
“ I don’t know when I have been so pleased
about anything.
“It turned out she lived only a few streets
away. But more than that she wouldn’t disclose.
I begged her eagerly to let me meet her there
and then. I explained the entire position, gave
the earliest hour at which my wife could possibly
return, expatiated on the unusual splendor of the
opportunity that offered. She was weakening.
I could feel it.
“ ‘ Well, if I come round, it’s only for a minute,
mind.’
“I had won. Exultantly I gave her direc-
tions. ‘ Expect me within to minutes,’ she said,
in those haunting, golden tones of hers. Beside
myself with triumph, I swallowed a stiff brandy
abd soda; lit a cigarette and settled down to wait.”

ever got to a loose life, and I have regretted it

The Chances That I Missed.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
AMIDST a haze of vain regrets
Which in my thoughts abound,
Breathing the scent of violets,
Fair phantoms gather round.
I clench my hands, now scant of pith,
My fingers intertwist ;
Those phantoms seem to taunt me with
The chances I have missed.
Such chances—had I only known
When lineless was my brow,
And all my teeth were all my own,
As much as I know now—
I courted girls, or lean or stout,
And many lips I’ve kissed
In former days. But what about
The chances that I missed ?
There was a widow, gently grave
And always very nice,
Whose furtive glances sometimes gave
Me leave to break the ice ;
Whilst I, regarding her in awe
With gaze abashed and trist,
Admired her charms, yet never saw
The lovely chance I missed.
The words of matrons two or three
Still echo in my ear.
Alas ! they failed in tempting me
To overcome my fear.
Bright spinsters of uncertain age,
And girls, a lengthy list
I call to mind, with futile rage,
As chances that I missed.
The luscious passion-fruit I might
Have gathered freely then,
The peaches which I longed to bite
But left for bolder men.
Because I lacked the nerve to try,
Or patience to persist—-
Are mem’ries which provoke a sigh
For easy chahces missed.
Coy signs that, in the years agone,
I rarely could detect
Are plain as Holy Writ to one
When viewed in retrospect.
Hot passion blinds a young man’s eyes
Though beauty grips his wrist,
His eyes grow old, and then he's wise.
And mourns the chance he missed.
The winter of my discontent
Is not quite dark and drear ;
I treasure in love’s tenement
Some recollections dear.
But now that women tempt no more
My chief regrets consist
In ruminative broodings o’er
The chances I have missed.

Ballade of the Locust’s Appetite.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
THE shadow of the years begins to grow,
The ginger lacks a little of its heat ;
The blowsy roses quickly overblow,
And the breezes carry just a hint of sleet.
■Corked is the wine, and overdone the meat
That was manna to the reckless young be-
ginner;
While the pace has slowed that once was Hot
and fleet,
In the years that the locust had for dinner.
The gee-gee of to-day seems all too slow,
And the “Sport of Kings” a barer, yiler
cheat. ,t, ..
Though the roarings; of the old-time ll;ey Mo,
Would have., quelled the Minotaur'in ancient
Crete —
Now Ikey should be in.his winding-sheet,
For his grandest coups are nothing like the
skinner
That the punters of the past were wont to meet,
In the years that the locust had for dinner.
The dear, delightful dames of long ago,
And the damosels demure and most discreet ;
No more behind the glasses do they glow,
All ardor in their eagerness to greet.
And the tea-room girls—dear, dimpled ducks and
neat,
Each in distracting starchy cap and pinner-;
They have lost their charm, that once were kind
and sweet
In the'years that the locust had for dinner.
Envoy.
So, I go a-pulling bells in Memory Street,
Though Youth stands by, a mocker and a
grinner.;,
But the days-are dead, that ran with tripping feet
In the years that the locust had for dinner.

MACHETE.
A Display of Boxing.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
A LETTER from the Rev. Elias Tregorry, of
All Saints’, Hawburn, to Charles Greville,
Esq., amateur lightweight champion of
Victoria :
The Parsonage,
Hawburn,
22/7/’OB.
My Dear Young Friend,
You will no doubt be surprised at receiving a
communication from me. For I fear, after the
admonition I felt it my duty to administer to you
through your dear mother on the sinfulness of
your ways some time ago, you have- nurtured
bitter' and uncharitable feelings towards me.
However, I trust by now you will have realised
that I acted only for your own spiritual welfare.
My reason for writing you is as follows :
We are holding a Charity F6te on the 17th of
next month, at the Shire Hall, in aid of the Home
for Consumptive Curates.
We desire to have as varied and interesting a
programme as possible. Knowing your profici-
ency in the noble art of self-defence, I venture to
hope that you may be willing to assist the cause
of charity "by arranging a display of boxing for
us. There can be no need for me to point out
that there must be no roughness—just a gentle
display of the art such as ladies might witness.
I trust you will see your way to assist us with
this worthy object. I will leave all the details to
you. Kindly convey my deepest respects to your
dear mother.
I am, my dear young friend,
Yours very sincerely,
Elias Tregorry.
From Charles Greville, Esq., to the Rev. E.
Tregorry :
Lockinge,
South Yarra,

Dear Sir,
Your favor of 22nd inst. to hand. I shall be
pleased to arrange a display of boxing for your
Charity Fete on the 17th prox.
Yours faithfully,
C. Greville.

land, of Mulga Downs, Riverina (N.S.W.) :

Dear .Timmy,
Enclosed you’ll find a letter from that old
bell-wether, Tregorry, who pitched such a tale
to the mater about that harmless jamboree of
ours last year. Said letter speaks for itself.
Wants a “ gentle display of the noble art suit-
able for ladies.”
Well, he’ll get it. Am writing forthwith to
“Snarlo” Ockings to see what can be done to
suitably accommodate the reverent blabber.
Wish you were here to share him with me. Shall
write full details later.
Truly, as it is written, the righteous sometimes
get a bit of their own back.
Yours, as much as my own,
C H ARLIE.
From C. Greville, Esq., to “ Snarlo” Ockings,
proprietor of the Carlton Boxing and Athletic
Club :
South Yarra,

Dear Snarl, .
Some sporty friends of mine, sick to death ot
watching fakes at the Pavilion, want to see a
good, willing 10-round mill—science doesn’t much
matter so long as there’s plenty of biff and blood.
Can you lay your hands on two likely lads .
There’ll be a fiver in it for you. as referee and
promoter, and a fiver each for the lads.
We want it for the 17th of next month ; of hour
and place I’ll inform you later. Let me know at
Sorry to hear of your little affair witn the police.
Yours sincerely,
Charlie Greville.

From C. Greville to J. Copeland, N.S.W.
Hotel Australian,
Sydney,
22/8/'OB.
Dear Jimmy,
I am sorry to have left you so long without
news of the Charity Fete; but as you see by
the above address, I have been travelling. Fact
is, I felt I required a change, so came over here
by the Roumania, which I boarded early on the
18th inst.
The F6te was a great success—greater far than
I anticipated.
The Hawburn Shire Hall was filled to over-
flowing with all the pick and flower of the Rev.
T.’s virtuous and respectable flock.
In all their sombre glad-rags they sat in upright
rows, with never a smile to break the dull mono-
tony of their hard dials.
Even a youth who sang the alleged comic song,
“There’s a Girl Inside,” shocked ’em, and was
suppressed. It made me ache to rouse’em. And
I did, too. Wait till I tell you. Punctually at
8.30 p.m. Snarlo turned up at the corner, accom-
panied by four other gents, to whom he intro-
duced me. They weren’t what you’d describe as
pretty.
They had the ingrowing foreheads, the pro-
truding teeth, the beady eyes and other pleasing
characteristics of the “ push” variety of citizen.
As you know, Snarlo himself hasn’t exactly a
face that you’d put in a plush frame. So alto-
gether they looked a pretty tough proposition.
For my purpose they were superb.
I smuggled ’em in at the rear entrance of the
hall and hid ’em in a dressing-room, where I
issued final instructions and just a hint of what to
expect.
Presently the Rev. T. bustled up as I stood on
guard outside the door, and inquired if we were
ready.
“ All ready,” I replied.
“Good,” said he. “ The—er—ring is fixed and
the curtain down, so I’ll go and announce the
item.”
While he was standing in front of the curtain,
sermonising on the noble art, I bustled Snarlo
and party into the ring.
Tregorry was saying in his pulpit voice: “To
show you the difference between the brutal,
bloodthirsty and inhuman sport of prize-fighting,
against which, as you know, I have fought so
strenuously, and the scientific art of boxing, I
have arranged a gentle display, which I am sure
you will admit has no objectionable feature in it.”
At a signal from Snarlo and a whispered :
“Righto, up with the rag,” I slipped into the
wings, switched the lights in the hall down low
and hoisted the curtain.
The perfunctory applause which broke out
changed into a gasp of astonishment and surprise.
not to say horror. It was a pretty tableau
enough. Snarlo. in a white sweater, leaned out
over the ropes : “Lydies an’gents,” he announced
in that sweet, husky voice of his —like a foghorn,
“ this is a ten-round go atween these’ere lads—
Micko Doolan, o’ Footscrav, ten stun twelve, an’
Poley Morgan, frum Port, heleven stun two an’
a narf.”
Just here the Rev. Elias Tregorry, who was
standing like a graven image, with dropped jaw
and an expression of blank horror on his counten-
ance, sprang to the ring-side.
“Wh—what’s the meaning of this?” he cried
in a shrill voice.
‘’Order!” bellowed Snarlo. “Git offer the
flamin’ platform—unless you’re a-goin’ to challenge
the winner?” he added.
“How—how'dare you !” spluttered the rever-
end one. “ You must leave here at once. There’s
some terrible mistake. Where’s Mr. Greville ? ”
(Mr. G. was hid in the wings.)
“Git down offer the platform,” ordered Snarlo,
and as the reverend gent, still argued, Snarlo
helped him violently.
“Sit still!” shouted Snarlo as some of the
pillars of the church in the front row made as if
to rise to the assistance of their pastor.
‘ ‘ Sit dahn ! ”
The pillars sat.
“ They’ll box the best o’ ten three-minute
rounds—one ter win,” continued the referee, “for
a five-pun’ note an’ t.her shower. So if their
exhibition o’ the noble hart pleases yer, why then
it’s up to yer to unbutton liberal. Now, put yer
pipes art, an’ give the lads a show.”
“Shake ’au’s,” he yelled, turning to the con-
testants. _
Each anxious and assiduous attendant quickly
stripped the overcoat off his man, and the two
lads advanced to the middle of the ring, wearing
each a loin cloth, a pair of mits and a determined
expression.
Amid hysterical squeals and screams of out-
raged modesty from the female jjortion, the
entire audience rose to its feet.
“ Order ! ” yelled Snarlo in a thunderous voice.
A tall, thin, be-whiskered individual in a long
BILL'S DILEMMA.

BILL : “ I've just found, a tray-bit, an', cuss

tion or a 'ot time!"
black frock-coat pushed forward. “Perhaps
you’ll explain the meaning of this disgusting and
immoral spectacle, Mr. Tregorrv, and also the
presence of these —these undesirable persons
here?” he said, fixing the reverend gent, with a
cold, green sea-bath of an eye.
“ Be cripes !” shouted Snarlo, ducking between
the ropes. “If I come dahn there I'll steady
ver.” He gazed fiercely and fixedly at the, tall,
frock-coated moralist. “ Sit dahn —all ! ’ he-
bel lowed.
All sat.
Snarlo gazed round fiercely for some moments,
snorted indignantly, and then clabbered back into-
the ring. “If I ’as to speak Hgen, 111 learn,
yers ! ” he hissed.
“ Corners ! Box on ! ”
The lads put their heads down and rushed at.
each other wildly. Biff ! bang ! They went at.
it like whirlwinds.
They knew nothing of science and apparently
cared less. But they were willing. They banged,,
whirled and clinched up and down the ring,.
Nothing was heard but the pad, pad of their feet,
the heavy thud of gloves on rib and head, and the-
constant: “ Break—break, blast yer ! ” from the
referee. The audience was still—frozen with
horror. Hidden in the wings I stood, watch in.
hand, and smote the gong at the end of the first
three minutes.
As they went to their corners both lads were
bleeding freely as to the nose, and puffy as to the
optics.
As the seconds fanned their supine princi-
pals and sprayed their heated faces with refresh-
ing showers, the Rev. T. jumped to his feet, and,
with a scream of anguish, rushed to the platform
with the intention of dropping the curtain and so
blotting out the hideous spectacle from the sight
of his outraged flock.
Snarlo, leaning over the ropes, caught him bv
the scruff of the neck and gently dropped him on.
to the floor.
The audience suddenly rose and stampeded for
the door.
" Stop /” thundered the referee ; and, leaping
down from the stage, he dashed to the door and
closed it with a bang. .
“ Don’t think to git away afore the collection,
he sneered as he put the key in his pocket.
Then he hustled them back to their seats. “ I’m.
a mild-mannered bloke meself,’’ he told them ;.
“ but, be cripes, don’t push me too far. This’ere
fight ’as got to be fought, an’ I’m the cove to see-
as it is. I don’t know whatcher game is, but I
see you’re tryin’ to queer the show, an’, by ’ell,
the next bloke what sez a word, or s’much as
moves, I’ll deal with ’im—SEE !”
Then slowly and with dignity he re-entered the
ring, and the fight—or, to be more exact, the
brawl—re-commenced. What would have been,
the natural end of the scuffle I cannot say.
But towards the conclusion of the third blind,
gory round, when the seconds came to words and
everything pointed to a general mix-up, tliere-
arose a loud banging on the doors, and above the
din of the argument we heard: “Open in the
name of the King ! ”
“The p’lice !” hissed Snarlo.
Some of those who had escaped in the stampede
had sought out police assistance. Though, as I
hurriedly explained to Snarlo, we had nothing to
fear from legal proceedings, being clearly within.
the law, still we decided to move off unosten-
tatiously.
So switching out all the lights in the hall, we
hastily made our exodus through the darkness-
and the back door.
We raced for the park at the bottom of the hill,
where the contestants were induced to put or>
their clothes. There I paid over the stake-
money. , ,
Then, with expressions of mutual esteem, we
parted, and made for home by devious paths.
First thing next morning I caught the boat on
here, feeling I would like to see the mater, and.
thinking perhaps I’d be better for a change of
scenery for a few weeks,
If there’s anything fresh I’ll write again.
Yours, till the crack of doom,
Charlie.
p.S.—I hear that the Bishop is very displeased l
with the Rev. Elias Tregorry.

I MAY not ride with Peter —
Except down quiet lanes
Whose dim bark-littered trackways.
No prying eye profanes —
For he is in disfavor.
So we ride behind the screen
Of slender saplings gathered
In a maze of brown and green.
They say that he is shiftless,
I know that he can ride —
His bay mare and my Dinah
Keep even, stride for stride,
Across the tangled bracken,
All green and copper fronds,
And the barren, sandy stretches
To the westward of The Ponds.
No good girls dance, they teß me,
With such a man as Paul.
His sins are very many,
But I forgive them all,
For he dances most divinely—
Still I know what folks w'll say;:
So I postpone our waltzes
Till the night slips round to day.
When filled with cake and coffee
The good old ladies drowse,
And the farmers get their horses
With thoughts of distant cows,
Unnoticed Paul and I may
Sway in a stolen spin,
Till all the world, a sparkling blur*
Whirls to the violin.
I might surprise the neighbors
Had I a decent chance ;
But Paul’s a fool with horses,
And Peter does not dance.
So Twill only be in Heaven
That (if I get there at all)
I can ride all day with Peter,
And dance all night with Paul.

The Civilisation of Sam.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
THE tracker propped himself against
the stable wall with one leg and an
air of resignation, and proceeded to
execute hieroglyphics on the sun-baked
earth with an equally sun-baked toe. A half-
grown kangaroo pup made frantic efforts to
attract his attention, but, in the mind of the
tracker, there was no room for kangaroo
pups. In point of fact, there was no room
for anything except his grievance. Even as
he dwelt upon it the injustice of it swelled
and grew.
Away against the sky-line, the author of
the trouble —to wit, Trooper Pat McManus
—-was cantering into the distance, singing
as lustily as though neither trackers nor
grievances existed in his sunlit corner of the
world.
But the tracker knew better. Here was
the boss off for the day—and the pub only a
mile away. So far, so good.
But the boss had left strict orders with
Hogan that he, Samuel, must not be served
with the luscious long beer, nor the luscious
anything else that possessed the magic power
of rendering him blissfully “shickered.” The
trouble had arisen through Sam’s celebra-
tion of McManus’s last absence, when, in
the exuberance of his (or Hogan’s) spirits,
he had thrown out a challenge to the white
race in general, and badly fractured the
peace of Skeleton Creek. McManus had, in
Sam’s opinion, taken an absurd view of the
occurrence, lienee his injunction to Ilogan.
Under other circumstances Sam would
have treated the prohibition order with the
contempt it deserved. Had he been financial
he could easily have secured the services of
a philanthropic, if impecunious, white per-
son who followed the open-air cult on the
bank of the creek ; and, for a consideration,
would gladly consent to procure necessary
refreshment for a colored gentleman; but he
was stone-broke till pay-day, and his credit
being summarily stopped the outlook was
black indeed. Even blacker than the out-
looker.
He cursed dejectedly. The pup continued
to frolic, and was rewarded with a well-
directed kick.
The trooper disappeared over the ridge,
leaving a faint plume of dust to mark his
trail; and Sam contemplated the advisa-
bility of approaching the publican. The pro-
spect was not encouraging. The beer mer-
chant had a wholesome fear of McManus, so
a refusal seemed imminent; and, as such a
happening w r ould seriously impair the dig-
nitv of the temporary representative of
“law-’n’-order” at Skeleton Greek, the afore-
said representative was dubious.
He aimed at the persistent pup another
kick which displayed a fine precision but
sadly lacked enthusiasm; made three well-
intentioned but unsuccessful efforts to ex-
pectorate, and surrendered unconditionally.
Half an hour later he turned up at
Hogan’s, resplendent in tunic, riding
breeches and leggings; the lot surmounted
bv a somewhat dilapidated helmet (on oft-
days it proved a useful conveyance for
lunch, fish-bait, etc.). Boots he dispensed
with as an irksome and altogether unneces-
sarv adiunct
‘ Hogan eyed him with disfavor mingled
with a tinge of discretion. There were times
when the hawk-eyes of the tracker saw
things the trooper passed unnoticed. Ihere-
fore he was a person whom it was desirable
to placate in moderation.
Sam opened the conversation with the air
of a seeker after knowledge. “G’d day, boss,”
lie remarked casually. “You bin see it that
pfeller trover bin come longa this way two
tu jf of ? a a n y reply was brusque, but
Sam was not easily depressed,
“My boss look out that pfeller,” he re-
sumed; “which way you thinkum sit down
how?”
Hogan couldn t, or wouldn t, say, but
Sam was perfectly satisfied. The drover was
merely a peg upon which to hang an open-
ing' remark. The place of his location was a
matter <d , supreme indifference both to
Samuel and Samuels boss, a fact of vhich
Hogan was well aware.
dropped the drover as a peison u -
worthy of discussion between gentlemen,
“i! ld . proceeded to direct the conversation as
diplomatically as might be into channels

Sam fiercely denied being an aboriginal,

**. * *
The track to the station seemed, in the eyes
of Samuel, hateful in the extreme.. The bril-
liant sunshine served only to remind him of
the wondrous thirst that possessed him. At
every step the fine white dust curled up in
little eddying clouds that helped to increase
his yearning for the long-sleever that is so
scarce in the land.
A column of dust in the vicinity of the
station caused him to quicken his steps. It
might be a traveller with a drop in a bottle,
and some small service or scrap of informa-
tion might, like virtue, bring its own re-
ward. But 100yds. further on he stopped
with a snort of disgust. His quick eye had
marked the folds of a turban over a face
almost as dark as his own.
“Plurry Afghan,” he grunted. ‘ Hawker,
mine t’ink it.”
He resumed Ins slouching mode of pro-
gression till he neared the cart. Then, sud-
de.nly, Ins step quickened. He looked like a
man with an idea,
The hawker came to meet him with a show
of cordiality. His limglish was limited a
fact which Sam noted with approval—and
he was evidently a new-chum.
_ “Good Mister-r-r-r,” he began ingra-
tiatingly. Nex water-r-r, how far-r-r?”
The tracker regarded him sternly “Why
you no got it name longa cart? he de-
manded. , , .
Name? The hawker gazed at him with
a S.,^; ir bewildennent. Then, suddenly:
Oh ! ?/es ’ Mis ter-r-r. 1 P a y the man. He
say the verree good name, Mister-r-r. I show
you, Mister-r-r.
WRONG IN DETAIL.
SHE : “I love, and I am loved.”
HE : "Then you must be perfectly happy.”
SHE : “No. It isn't the same matt.”
He pointed to the side of the van, where,
in white lettering on a blue ground,
the mystic words, “FATTEH DEEN,
LICENSED HAWKER,” were emblazoned.
But Sam was not to be bluffed.
“Tha’s no damn good,” he announced.
“Tha’s the cove make it the cart.”
The Indian seemed puzzled.
“The man he say the verree good, name,
Mister-r,” he repeated, helplessly. “I say
...‘Fatteh Been?’... The man say ‘Or-
right !”" He pointed again to the letters.
“He say, ‘Fatteh Deen. Verree good!”
Sam adopted a judicial attitude, and the
hawker altered his tactics. He produced a
piece of dirty paper from the innermost re-
cesses of his garments, and waved it
triumphantly before the tracker’s eyes.
“Mister-r-r,” he proclaimed, decisively. “I
buy the li-sen. The man say my li-sen the
verree good li-sen. Oh, yes, Mister-r-r.”
Sam remained sceptical.
“That yarn no good,” he decided. “I’ll
’res’ you any’ow. You baal got um name
longa cart.”
Fie grabbed the bewildered hawker as he
spoke, but that individual objected strenu-
ously. Lithe and wiry, he fought as the cat
fights; and from a picturesque scrap Sam
emerged victorious, but minus several un-
important portions of skin, hair and “uni-
form.” With the air of a conqueror he bore
the vanquished one toward the cell.
“Come ahn you,” he commanded. “You
done it now. F’ plurry fool. Fightin’ th’
p’leece; tear it tiff uniform, too. Spare me
day! Cors y’ two plurry quid. My word!”
Sam bustled his prize into the cell without
ceremony; and retired to treat his wounds
and await developments.
In 10 minutes the prisoner’s head appeared
at the man-hole. Plainly he was convinced
of the seriousness of his offence.
“Mister-r-r,” he began apologetically. “I
ver’ sorree I break the coat. Never-r-r be-
for-re I bad man, Mister-r-r. I stop her-re,
Mister-r-r, how long?”
The tracker considered.
“Boss come back one week. Mine think it
cors y’ ten poun’.”
The hawker wilted obviously.
“One week. Oh! Mister-r-r. My car-rt
might be some man steal all the thing.
Mister-r-r. I pay the monee.” He produced
a pound note. “Never-r-r I come back. Mis-
ter-r-r.”
Sam considered. “Orright,” he assented.
“Spos’n you clear out good way, i fine y’
meself.”
The prisoner fervently protested his in-
tention of fleeing to the uttermost ends of
the earth.
Sam led his prisoner to the tiny room
where justice was, at rare intervals, dis-
pensed to the extremely rare drunk. If he,
Samuel, were to usurp the judicial office, he
felt that it was up to him to do the thing
well. He seated himself gravely at the table
and toyed with a pen.
“You stan’ over there,” he told his victim,
imperiously. Then, angrily, as the thought
struck him, “What for you wear um hat
’longa court ’ouse? You plurry fool.” He
pointed to the offending turban.
The wearer thereof protested hastily. He
began to explain how the wrath of Buddha,
or Vishnu, or some other exalted personage
would inevitably
His dusky judge bounded from the Bench.
“Y’ COW!” he shouted. “Y’ don’ pull it
th’ hat off, I knock y’ bloomin’ ’ead off.
Quick, too.”
The turban collapsed forthwith, and his
worship subsided upon the Bench.
The prisoner still profferred the pound,
and the Bench eyed it covetously.
“You baal got um name longa cart.
Guilty? Ain’t it?”
He looked toward the hawker for con-
firmation of his views, but, as the prisoner
was plainly puzzled, he went on aravely:
“Orright. Fine y’ one poun’ or five plurry
year. Gib it th’ poun’.”
The prisoner tendered the amount.
The magistrate gazed at him question-
ingly.
“Tear it th’ coat, too,” he reminded him.
“How much more one poun’-note you got it?”
The defendant de-
clared himself hopelessly
insolvent, whereupon his
Worship left the Bench,
and proceeded to search
for possible hidden trea-
sure. Having verified the
truth of the hawker s
statement, he returned
to his seat to deliberate
upon the problem. There
could be no sense lin
fining a person who had
no more cash. Anyhow,
the pound was eminently
satisfactory ; but the dig-
nity of the Court must
be preserved at all haz-
ards.
Sam regarded the
offender with a judicial
eye.
“Orright,” he decided.
“Mine tink it now mine
bin tear it that coat
’nother day meself. You
clear out now. S’pos’n
you come ’ere agen, mine
bin fine y’ ten plurry
year.”
He threw open the
door with the air of a
monarch conferring the
Royal Pardon.
Half an hour later the
ancient philosopher from
the creek presented him-
self at Hogan’s bar-
counter with a pound
note and a demand for
two bottles of whisky.
Hogan surveyed the
wealth with surprise.
Twice, on the preceding
day, he had refused cre-
dit to this same capital-
ist. But to be inquisi-
tive, he reflected, was
neither wise nor polite.
He produced the whisky.

When McManus re-
turned at dusk, he met
a joyously inebriated
Samuel, who leaped on
him before he knew that war had been de-
clared. It took 10 minutes strenuous cam-
paigning to convince Samuel of the error of
his ways, and a further five minutes healthy
exercise with a stirrup leather to extort a
confession. Then McManus retired to his
quarters to consider his position.
Later on, he journeyed to the bank of the
creek and yarded, on general principles, the
blissfully unconscious disciple of the open-
air cult; while away in the darkness a
scared Asiatic, with a prime assortment of
strange curses, urged two tired horses to take
him further from a black devil to whom he
alluded with curses aud opprobrium.

Where Truth IS
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
The finest Hamlet of his time
Appeared before the paper men;
Sad was the visage of the mime.
He pointed to a column, then
“Your criticism I have read
Of my performance, sirs,” he said.
“I mind not being criticised
AVhen what the critic says is true —
Indeed, I’ve cuttings highly prized
A hundred weight to show to you—
But herein it is written down
My Hamlet’s something of a clown.
“’Tis said I lack distinction, too;
3ly elocution is described
As stilted, sirs, and, later, you
Have at my comprehension jibed.
You say ’tis mediocre art,
That I misunderstand the part.”
With every phrase much warmer waxed
The finest Hamlet. “Furthermore
With want of dignity I’m taxed.”
He finished with a strident roar.
“Me DULY! Me STALE! Why, hang it,
gents,
YOU DON’T READ OUR ADVERTISE-
MINTS!”

SILAS SNELL.
Bohemian and Puritan.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
(Told by the Cynical Philosopher.)
LISTEN a bit if you’ve half an hour —
Or less than a half to spare,
A sigh to give and a tear to drop
For the woes of a wedded pair.
On the day that I saw the couple wed
I knew ’twas a tragedy,
And ’mid the roses and boots and rice
Was a shake of the head from me.
You see I’m a student of Temperament,
And the human types I know,
And that’s why I shake a waggling head,
Why I murmur “ I told you so.”
For he was an artist of chrome and paint,
And the blood of the martyrs ran
In the chastened veins of the strenuous Ruth,
The child of a Puritan.
For he was a dweller in Devil-may-care,
A drinker of wine and beer ;
Who laughed at the laws of a moral age,
And had for the Church a sneer.
For him the mission of life was mirth,
The motto : “ Let grief go hang ” ;
For her : “Be sorry for other’s woes,
And sad for your neighbor’s pang.”
But over his brow was a tuft of hair,
And over his mouth another ;
And these he spread for the haloed maid,
One snare by the side of t’other.
And for all her Bible, and all her psalms,
And for all her halo golden,
He won that maid as the maids are won
Through all love's story olden.
And so they wedded, this youthful pair,
So blind that she told her mother
(The while he babbled “ affinity”)—
“ God meant us for one another.”
Eh ! you’ve listened a bit, and I haven’t told
Of the woes of a wedded pair.
Why haven't I spoke of their characters ?
And isn’t the story there ?
They’re parted. . . Isn’t that tale enough ?
I saw him a while ago,
And he only laughed when I said again,
“ Now didn’t I tell you so ? ”
She’s home again with her parents now,
A-teaching the child its psalm ;
Her halo, saved from the Land of Sin,
Shines over her features calm.
Though at times her eyes are sad for him,
The gay Bohemian,
And often a prayer goes up above
For that Devil-may-care young man.

On Work.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
THE man walking rapidly, with a neat
brown paper parcel under his arm,
looks as if he has been considerably
trimmed and burnished. You can see that
liis renovation is not at all a usual thing.
The man who leans against a verandah-post
seems as if there is no earthly reason why
he should trouble about such matters. He is
limp and listless.
“Don’t stop me,” says the burnished one
as he passes. “I’m in a desperate hurry.”
The post appendage does not seem at all
interested.
“Gimme a match,” says the hurrying one,
stopping abruptly.
The listless one produces a match, and the
man who has had a wash fetches a cigarette
end from ms pocket and lights it. After
three puffs he snuffs it out and returns it to
his pocket.
“I must be goin’ now. Got ter be down
at the Masonic be 1U.30, an’ it on’y wants
three minutes now.”
“What yer got in the parcel?” asks the
dejected one.
“A suit tor a bloke wot’s goin’ ter be mar-
ried at 12. We’ve bin up ail night finishiu’
it off. He’s bin ringin’ us up ail the morn-
in’ about it.”
“Who’s us?”
“Us is the firm I’m workin’ for.”
“Oh! What-o! Workin’? My oath, you
take the bun all right!” cries the lounger,
growing hilariously interested.
“Well, what do you think? A-course I’m
workin’ ?”
“Since when?”
“Since 9.30 a.m.”
“What does it feel like?”
“All sirgarneo! My oath, you take my
word, it’s grand. If I’d knowed what work
is like I’d a bin graftin’ years ago.”
“It’s on’y fools en’ ’orses what works,”
says the other man, contemptuously spitting
into the gutter over his shoulder.
“Well, I’m not a fool, and I’m not a ’orse,
an’ I’m workin’, an’ I’m going ter keep on
workin’. See! Gimme a match.”
He brings his cigarette out again, and
takes three more puffs, snuffs it, and re-
turns it to his pocket.
“What are yer doin’?”
“Oh, a sort of rouseabout in a tailor’s shop
a few doors up. The governor’s a all-right
sort of bloke, too, as good as they make
’em.”
“Yer can have yer job fer me,” sneers the
listless man.
“And I’m goin’ to, my oath. I likes you
blokes sneerin’ at work, but I tell you that
it is the right and proper thing. And some
day you’ll see all about it. Work is the
finest thing in the world. It knocks bummin’
kite high. What’s the good of bummin’,
enyway? What do you git be it? On’y a
bumper or two, a few cigarette ends, en’ a
beer now en again, en’ all the rest of the
time where are you? Then look at me, busy
all day, occupyin’ me mind, payin’ fer me
own beers with money what I’ve earned
honest, en’ as happy as Larry. An’ what’s
ahead of me? Mind yer, I’m not boastin’,
but be strict attention to me dooties I makes
meself indispensable to the boss, as the sayin’
is, and I saves me money, and when I sees
that the boss can’t do without me I says ter
’im, ‘I wanter be taken in partnership, or
I’ll start in opposition in the shop next door.’
The boss sees that he’s got a good man, and
a-course he takes me in. And then what do
I do? I builds up the business. The shop’s
not big enough, so I takes the shop next
door, an’ a year after another shop, and we
builds up a few storeys on top, an’ by-and-
bye we owns the whole block, and we calls
the show a emporium. And ’ow do you
stand in? You leans against a post, and
sees me drivin’ past in a carriage and pair,
and you says to another bloke, ‘You wouldn’t
think that bloke what just drove by in a
carriage aud pair useter sleep in the Do-
main?’ And he sa.Yn. ‘No, you wouldn’t.
Who is he?’ And you says, ‘That’s the new
Anthony ’Ordern, Soaker Smith. We useter
be pals onct.’ Gimme a match.”
“Go and buy yer own matches. Blime,
do yer think I’m standin’ ’ere all day ter
keep you in matches?”
“Oh, well, I’ll ’ave ter use me own.”
He lights up again, takes the usual num-
ber of puffs, and returns the cigarette end
to his pocket.
“Well, so long. I must be goin’ now.
The bloke will be real mad at me keeping
him waiting for his togs. Hullo, was that
11 o’clock?”
“Sounds like it, and I’m feelin’ like it,
too.”
“Oh, come and ’ave a drink with me. I’ve
got sixpence. The boss gave it me to take a
tram down, and I was walkin’ to save the
money, so’s I could ’ave a beer.”
They disappear into the nearest bar.
A man from the tailor’s shop a few doors
up rushes down the street. A quarter of an
hour later he rushes back, looking the mad-
dest man in creation.
Some minutes later Soaker Smith and his
friend come from the bar wiping their
mouths. Soaker is talking with animation.
The friend takes up his position at the post,
and Soaker ceases his discourse on the ad-
vantages of work to say, “Gimme a match.”
This time the out-of-work hands him a
box. Soaker tries to open it ineffectually.
“Blow me if I can open it,” he says.
“What sort of a match-box is it?”
“Oh, that’s the trick. Try.”
For 15 minutes Soaker does his best with-
out any success.
“It’s a fair cow of a match-box,” he says.
“Where did you git it?”
“Picked it up.”
“Can you open it?”
“No.”
Soaker shakes it close to his ear.
“I don’t think there’s any matches in it.
Here, take it back. I’ll use one of me own.”
He is in the intent attitude of lighting a
remnant of cigarette without burning his
nose when an angry tailor catches him by
the two shoulders and shakes him with ail
his strength.
“You lazy vagabond !” he hisses.
Then his feelings overcome him, and he
kicks Soaker just as vigorously as God has
given him power to do. Snatching up the
paper parcel he darts for a tram.
Soaker follows with vengeance gleaming
in his eyes.
“I’ll learn you to assault me, you old dog,
he shouts. “On’y let me git ’old of yer, an’
I’ll screw yer neck.”
Then, as he sees the tram moving off, he
shouts: “Pay me me wages. If yer don’t
pay me me wages I’ll take yer ter court.
I’ll summons yer.”
The tram is too far off now.
“How much does he owe you?” asks an
onlooker.
“Oh, about ninepence, unless the law
allows me a week for being discharged with-
out notice.” „ .
When he gets back to his friend, that fel-
low says: “He got you one that time,
Soaker. My oath, I did laugh. It was as
good as a pantomime.”
Soaker takes his stand by an adjacent post
and lights his cigarette end. After taking
three reflective puffs' and returning the frag-
ment to his pocket again, he says
“You sed it’s on’y fools an’ ’orses what
work, an’ I don’t know but what you was
right, after all.”

“Give me the salt spray in my face
And the sea wind in my hair;
A piping gale from the sou-sou-west,
And a ship hound anywhere!
With the phosphor-bells in the churning wake,
And the dancing clouds overhead,
And I wouldn’t call the Queen my aunt!”
As the red-haired ho’sun said.
“Give me the smell of the Stockholm tar,
From the serving on the shrouds,
And the rolling swell of the southern sea,
’Neath the madly-racing clouds,
With a pint of rum and a Gouda cheese,
And a pipe of negrohead,
And I wouldn’t call the King my dad!”
As the red-haired ho’sun said.
“Give me a hunk in the fo’c’sle head,
On the lee sidelas we go,
And the bilge-wash for a lullaby,
When it comes my watch below!
■Give me a hammock and good round shot,
When my span of life is sped,
And fifty fathoms of clean blue sea!”
As the red-haired bo’sun said.

[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
I moral should be rey e .
| Therefore this is a story with a
moral,
The lower end of Bill-street otherwise
William—overlooks Blue s Point-road, with
a vacant wedge-shaped allotment, running
down from a Scots church, between Bill-
street the aforesaid and the road, and a ter-
race on the other side of the road. A cheap,
mean-looking terrace of houses, flush with
the pavement, with two windows up stairs
and a large one in the middle down stairs,
and with a slit to the side of it called a
door, and looking remarkably skully in
ghastly dawns, afterglows, and rainy after-
noons and evenings. Each slit looks as if
the owner of the skull got it there with an
upward blow of a sharp tomahawk, from a
shorter man—who was no friend of his—
just about the time he died. The slits open
occasionally, and mothers of the nation,
mostly holding their garments together at
neck or bosom, lean out—at right angles al-
most—and peer up and down the road—as
if they are casually curious as to what is
keeping the rent-collector so late this morn-
ing. Then they shut up till late in the day,
when a boy or two comes home from work,
There are four houses. It is seldom that
more than two of them are occupied at one
time often only one. lenants never shift
in, or at least are never seen to, but they get
there. The sign is a furtive candle light be-
hind an old table-cloth, or a skirt, or any
rag of dark stuff, tacked across the front
bedroom window, upstairs, and a shadow
suggestive of a woman making up a bed on
the floor.
If more than two of the houses are occu-
pied, there is almost certain to be; an old
granny with ragged grey hair, who folds
her arms tight under her ragged old breasts
and bends her tough old body, and sticks her
ragged, grey old head out of the slit called a
door, and squints up and down the road, but
not with any malicious intent —onljl out of
mild, ragged-grey duriosity regarding the
health or affairs of the rent-collector.
Perhaps there are no bills to be collected
in Skull Terrace —because no credit is given.
No jugs are put out, because there is no
place to put them, except on the pavement,
or on the narrow window ledges, where they
would be in great and constant danger from
the feet and elbows of passers by. There
are no tradesman’s entrances to the houses
in Skull Terrace.
Tenants and sub-tenants often leave on
Friday morning in the full glare of the day.
Granny throws down garments from the top
window to hurry things, and the wife below
ties up much in an old allegedly green or red
tablecloth, on the pavement, at the last
moment. The van is of the bottle-oh variety.
It is all done very quickly, and nobody
takes any notice—the other tenants are
never there long enough. Landlord, landlady,
or rent-collector —or whatever it is—calls
later on, maybe, knocks in a tired, eveh
bored, way, makes inquiries next door, and
goes away wearily, leaving the problem to
take care of itself. The business people of
North Sydney, especially removers and labor-
ers, are very casual. Down old Blue’s Point-
road the folk get so casual that they just
exist, but don’t seem to.
One thing I never could make out is that,
when one house becomes vacant from a
house-agent’s point of view—there is a per-
manent atmosphere of vacancy about the
whole terrace —the people of another remove
into it. And there’s not the slightest differ-
ence between the houses. It is because the
removal is such a small affair, I suppose, and
the change is the main thing. I always do
better for a while in a new house —but then
I always did seem to get on better some-
where else.
But just now, in the heat of summer, the
terrace happens to be full, and all the blinds
are decent. Two of the tenants are newly
come to Skull Terrace, and the other blinds
are looked up, washed, and fixed up by force
of example, or from very shame’s sake.
All of which seems to have nothing what-
ever to do with the story, except that the
scene is down opposite my balcony as I think
and smoke, and it is a blur on one of the
most beautiful harbor views in the world.
I had been working hard all day, mend-
ing the fence, putting up a fowlhouse and
some lattice-work and wire-netting, and
lime-washing and painting. Labors of love.
I’d rather build a fowlhouse than a story
or terrace of verses any day. And when
finished —the fowlhouse I mean —I sit and
contemplate my handy work with pure and
unadulterated joy. And I take a candle out
several times, after dark, to look at it again. I
never got much pleasure out of rhyme, story or
first-class London Academy notice. I find
it difficult to drag myself from the fowl-
house, or whatever it is, to meals, and
harder still to leave it for this story,
and I lie awake planning next day’s
work until I fall asleep in the sleep
of utter, happy weariness. And I’m up and
at it, before washing, at daylight. But f
was a carpenter and house-painter first.
Well, it had been a long, close day, and I
was very dirty and tired, but with the
energy and restlessness of healthy, happy
tiredness when work is unfinished. I was
out of two-inch nails, and the shops were
shut.
Then it struck me to start up the copper
and have a real warm bath after my own
heart and idea. The bathroom is outside,
next the wash-house and copper. There was
plenty of splinters and ends of softwood
that were mine by right of purchase and
labor. My landlady is, and always has
been, sensitive on the subject of firewood.
She’d buy anything else to make the house
comfortable and beautiful. She has beea
known to buy a piano for one of her nieces
and burn rubbish in the stove the same day.
I knew she was uneasy about the softwood
odds and ends, but I couldn’t help that —
she’d still be sentimental about them if she
had a stack of firewood as big as the house.
There’s at least one thing that most folk
hate to buy—mine’s bootlaces and bone
studs, so long as I can make pins and inked
string do.
I put a bucket of water in the copper,
started a fire under that, sent sparks out of
the wash-house flue at an alarming rate,
filled the copper to the brim, and, in the ab-
sence of a lid, covered it with a piece of gal-
vanised iron.
I tacked the side edge of a strip of canvas
to the match-board wall along over the
inner edge of the bath, fastened a short
piece of gaspipe to the outer edge, with
pieces of string through holes made in it,
and let it hang down over the bath, leaving
a hole at the head for my head and shoul-
ders. I was going to have a long, comfort-
able, and utterly lazy and drowsy hot water
and steam bath, you know.
I fastened a piece of clothes-line round
and over the head of the bath, and twisted
an old toilet-table cover and a towel round
it where it sagged into the bath, for a head-
rest —also to be soaped for the places where
I couldn’t get at my back with my hands.
I went up to my room for some things,
and it struck me to arrange two chairs by
the bed —candle and matches and tobacco
on one, and a pile of Jack London, Kipling
and Yankee magazines on the other, with
the last Lone Hand and Bulletin on top.
Going down with pyjamas, towel, soap,
etc., it struck me to have a kettle and a
saucepan full of water on the stove, to use
as the water in the bath cooled.
I took a roomy, hard-bottomed kitchen
chair into the bathroom, and on it I placed a
carefully-scraped, cleared and filled pipe,
matches, more tobacco, toothbrush, saucer
with a lump of whiting and salt, piece of
looking-glass and a knife. And I knocked a
few three-inch iron nails in the wall to hang
things on. I placed a clean suit of pyjamas
over the back of the chair, and over them
the towels.
I arranged with the landlady to have a
good cup of coffee made, and as she knows
how to make it, ready to hand in round the
edge of the door when I should be in the
bath. There’s nothing in that. I’ve been
with her for years, and, on account of the
canvas, it would be just the same as if 1
were in bed.
On second thoughts I asked her to hand in
some toast, or bread and butter and bloatei-
paste at the same time.
I fed the fire with judgment, and the
copper boiled just as the last blaze died
down. . , , . ,
I got a pail and carried the water into
the bath, pouring it in through the opening

The last few pints I dipped into the pail
with a cup. . . , , , ,
I covered the opening with a towel, to
keep the steam and heat in until I was
iea i dy got the boiling water from the kitchen
into the bucket, covered it with another
towel, and stood it in a handy corner in the
bathroom. . , , ,
I made an opening between towel and
canvas, turned on the cold water tap. ana
commenced to undress. I hung my clothes
on the wall till morning, for I intended to
go straight from the bath to bed, and read
in my pviamas. , _
I turned off the cold water tap to be sure,
lifted the towel off, and put my good right
foot in to feel the temperature—into about
three inches of cold water that was vanish-
ing. , ,
I’d forgotten to put in the plug!
I’m deaf, vou know, and the landlady,
hearing the writer run, thought I was sloosh-
ing out the bath (we were new tenants),
and wondered vaguely why I was so long a.
lt- I dressed rather hurriedly, in mv work-
ing clothes, went inside, and spread myseit
dramatically on the old cane lounge, and
covered my face with my oldest hat to snov
that it was comic, and I took it that way.
But my landlady was so full of sympathy,
condolence and self-reproach (because she
had failed to draw my attention to the
gurgling) that she let the coffee and toast
up and lay on my bed, and was so
tired and misty and far away, that I went
to sleep without undressing, or even wasn-
ing my face and hands. ,
How manv, in this life, forget the plug.
And how many, ah ! how many, who Passed
through, and are passing through skull ier-
race, commenced life as confident, care-
free and clear-headed, and with such easily
exercised, careful, intelligent, practised, and
methodical attention to details as I did tne
bath arrangements —and forgot to put m
the plug.

Remember that the
Gillette Razor
needs no . ,
stropping or
honing .
Comfort and Pleasure in Shaving
begin as soon as you start to use the Gillette Safety Razor.
All the bother of stropping and honing—all
the time wasted in getting a razor right for
shaving, is saved when you use a Gillette.
The Gillette is ready for use the moment you
pick it up, and you can shave with it as easily as
you lather your face. There is nothing to learn
—the blade itself curves and makes the correct
angle at which you must shave. It is therefore
impossible to use it in any but the right way.
Moreover, the Gillette is the only razor that
can be adjusted to the exact thickness of your
beard. What this means in additional comfort
you can hardly imagine. It entirely overcomes
the harshness in shaving a coarse beard, and if
the skin is tender it enables you to shave with
an exquisitely smooth touch, without causing
the least smarting or irritation.
Why not buy a Gillette, and start to shave
yourself in comfort without delay ? Think of
the saving of time and trouble, the ease and
smoothness and the safety of using a Gillette.
And remember, it lasts a lifetime.
The Gillette Safety Razor is sold everywhere in velvet-lined morocco case, complete with 12 double-edge blades. Ask ‘o see the Combination sets with Gillette shaving
soap and brush—ideal for gifts and holiday use—also the Pocket Editions. Made in the British Empire. Ask for booklet at any dealers, or write direct to

“Kaitangata tka” : One reason, and pro-
bably the main one, why sharks are at-
tracted close in shore is the amount of dead
fish left to waste its sweetness on the desert
beach. The shark has a marvellous sense
of smell, and if he gets a whiff of his de-
funct brother, his voracious appetite will
drive him to take any risk to obtain the
goods. If ripe surf girl happens to be han-
dier, that will do jufet as well, but it is
generally the old fish that brings the shark
to the vicinity of the new woman. Last
Saturday some ignorant or thoughtless per-
son who had killed several stingrays at La
Perouse left them rotting in the sun, and a
hungry eight-footer was suddenly discovered
nosing • round where some children were
bathing. Not long ago I saw a • school
of the brutes cruising about a rock on
which a couple of the family, caught over-
night, had been abandoned. They were mad
with hunger, and so fiercely determined _ to
grab the lunch that they were launching
themselves upward from the water to reach
the counter. We harpooned three of them,
and hooked another, but the balance still
surged round the rock, until the tide went
down. It was the same rock, too, that we’d
dived off hundreds of times.

“Itan” muses :— 1
Ever and anon the Judge peers over his pince-nez
at the guilty man behind the spikes, and offers a lec-
t.urette on Beer. The cant goes ablaze in the street,
flares into the head-lines in the daily papers, and is
hosed at a score of innocent congregations next Sun-
day. There is no exception, saith the Prohibition
person—every crime is due to Rum! How ludi-
crous is this attempt to saddle all crimes on the
Barrel and the Decanter. As a matter of fact, the
average 18-carat criminal is a sober soul. Drink
would end his career in a trice —long before he be-
came callous and cunning enough to succeed at a
decent swindle' or perpetrate a robbery of the re-
spectable order. The professional burglar, the alert
pickpocket, the clever confidence trickster are con-
vinced teetotalers to a malefactor. A smart burglar
cannot be the buqgler which a tippler always is.
For this reason thp instinctive criminal steers right
clear of the drinking class as confederates. The
latter are generally squeakers when pinched, or ,
.squealers when yarded into a corner. The pro-
fessional gambler, too, is mostly a sober individual,
for the same reason—he needs an unerring eye, a
steady hand and a brain unclouded by liquor. A
man may preach 1 rilliantlv when half-drunk, but
he can’t gamble brilliantly. The amateur criminal
pvho develops the public-house habit, may drift in
‘the direction of small forgery or an obscure shortage
in the cash, but most men who have obscure short-
ages in the cash are sober —painfully sober. Gener-
'ally they have toiled for many years on a salary so
small as to make beer unattainable ; then, when the
habit of tcetotalism is so deeply ingrained that it
is impossible to shake it off, they are driven by the
shabbiness of their clothes to make a hole in the
cash-box. They do it clumsilv, because they are not
experts, and the cheap lawyer, hired for the defence,
sees that the case is hopeless, and pleads the drink-
craving because he knows that will give his Honor
a chance to hold forth at great length, and his
Honor is so pleased with himself when he has held -
forth at great length, that he makes the sentence
lighter. His Honor has been even known to hold
forth at great length with a half-bottle of whisky
comfortably warming his own learned innards, and
another half-bottle in prospect.
The shortest charge to an Australian jury
was delivered by Justice a’Beckett, in Mel-
bourne, in August, 1h94. The case against
the accused was overwhelming. “What have
you to say to the jury?” inquired his Honor.
“I have nothing to say,” said the accused.
“Gentlemen of the jury,” said a’Beckett, “I
have nothing to say either. What have you
to say?” And the jury cut its observations
down to a laconic “Guilty.”
“Trotter” : Australia has a big interest in
the agreement just concluded between Ger-
many and Russia, under which Russia, re-
gardless of Britain’s feelings, dak with-
drawn its opposition to the Bagdad railway.
This line will link Constantinople to the
Persian Gulf, and ultimately to Bombay,
which means that the journey from London
to; Bombay will be shortened by five days:
viz., from 12 to seven. And, of course, a similar
period will be taken off the trip between Aus-
tralia and London. I have not calculated
wffiether we are to go quicker by the Port
Darwin railroad or that to Westralia. Any-
how, there are to be more days shorn off
thus. What will be the minimum time be-
tween Australia and England l M. Schmidt,
of' the Paris Excelsior, has just gone all
round the globe in less than 40 days (39
daiys 194 hours), via Siberia, Vancouver,
Yokohama and New York.
When are paper towels to be introduced into
Australia’s public lavatories and for domes-
tic use? They have them;in America —eight
a penny ordinary small size, or 30 a penny
smallest size—and in Germany, at schools,
restaurants, railway stations, etc. The
paper towel is intended to rid civilisation of
tlae contagious evils attaching to the roller
towel, which relieves many hands of their
wetness, and leaves them only moderately
damp. It is an offspring of the paper ser-
viette, and much more earnest in well-doing
than its parent. The rule with all decent
bodies politic was one serviette for one per-
son at all times; but up to now the linen
towels in lavatories have been circulating
mediums for any disease they might happen
to catch.

A Maoriland Supreme Court Judge learned
a new word the other day—“rigger.” It
seems to be short for “square-rigger,” and in
these days of Prohibition, when it’s the
common thing to keep a drop in the cup-
board, the prevalent habit is to use a
“square-rigger” for the job. The old four-
sided “square-face” bottle is It.

. H.S.M.’s tale of the way the Banks help
the Birth-rate: —-
Met Brown in. Timaru (M.L.), where. I was com-
pleting my twelfth year of servitude with a leading
bank. Brown had been slaving for 1.3 years in an
opposition institution which had its head office in
London. Brown seemed dejected. After a while he
told me liis trouble. Contrary to the bank’s rules
he had married some time before (his salary was
under £2O0 —£175 to be exact), and the girl was
in hiding in Christchurch. For several good and
sufficient reasons she was getting restive about her
position. I regret to say that I advised him to
make a clean breast of it. He did, and immediately
got the sack. He tried to get a job—any job—but
failed. A dismissed officer and a married man mostly
does. In the end we other clerks got up a small
“purse” for him, and this, together with a bit he
had saved, bought him and his wife two steerage
tickets to the Cold Country. The Lord knows what
has become of them. The bank still passes its vote
of thanks to the officers, and pays a roaring dividend.
“Castaway”: They have a custom, here in
tjondon, of bringing dogs into the dining-
room, and chaining them to the legs of the
tables. When the female owner of the dog
has half finished her frozen meat, she places
her plate under the dog’s nose, and he has
his turn. The dog sleeps in her bedroom,
and is led out on the footpath morning and
evening. I think it was this pleasant cus-
tom that forced the hobble-skirt on the fair
sex, and nearly led to the adoption of the
harem skirt. No lady can safely wear a
train to her dress in London. Also, she
holds her head high. Some people think
that’s due to pride, but it isn’t. She is
merely keeping her nose as much out of the
way as possible. There are 6,000,000 dogs
in England, and only 3,000,000 in Germany.
Germany has so many infants to feed that
it hasn’t much time or victual for dogs.
London Referee, snorting at the leader
of the local “Unionist” party, says:—
The woman who dreads a mother's pain, and will
not do her duty by the State, is a soul akin to the
spirit of the Leader of the Opposition. So great is
the refusal of maternity by women in the classes re-
presented by Mr. Balfour, that the love of dolls is
dying out among little girls. The modern child of
the effete class has no love for a doll. Teddy-bears,
gollywogs, toy shop freaks replace the dolls, which
for centuries have awakened the spirit of motherhood
in little girls.
Which is a very owlish view of the trouble.
The anti-maternity, movement started in
America, the land of pampered city women.
It gained a lot of its force among the moder-
ately dollared class from the dearth of hired
“helps” and the consequent development of
the flat system of domestic establishment.
In Noo Yark, the toniest quarter of tne city
(where the best flats can be obtained) is
reserved for childless tenants. A young wife
who aspires to maternity is confronted with
the necessity of having to shift her domicile
to a comparatively “vulgar” neighborhood if
she acquires “encumbrances.” Therefore, she
relinquishes her aspirations in that direction,
and buys a teddy bear. The teddy came
from America to Britain, and was originally
the toy of the childless woman, anyhow. To
say that its adoption by little girls is evi-
dence of a “refusal of maternity” by the
mothers who bore them is equivalent to say-
ing that these little girls come of families in
which it is hereditary to have no children.
The one habit that can’t be handed down
from generation to generation is the habit of
childlessness. A family may have the habit
of being an orphan or a posthumous child,
or of being divorced or dead, but the germ of
childlessness dies with its owner.
The hat builders and chiffon stores have
devised a new bandbox label for a particular-
ly troublesome brand of female pirate. The
legend is, “Will Not Be Exchanged,” and it
is designed to thwart the woman who gets
an expensive hat on approval, wears it to a
function or two, and then returns it to the
sho” as unsuitable. The mean dodge is prac-
tised by a lot of wealthy (or reputedly
wealthy) women who run accounts, but are
not ready to run them as high as Kosciusko
to gratify their vanity. First-class hat
prices are too stiff to allow an ambitious
dresser of limited allowance to hat lavishly ;
so some of the maddest hattera have gone in
for this mild species of fraud. Of course, :
the hat pirate buys a “little” hat from the
defrauded milliner now and then; but with
a cityful of good shops to operate on, a
clever woman can do wonders and still keep
her actual purchases within limits. A second
form of brigandage which was rampant be-
fore the protective notice was adopted was
to keep a smart little milliner girl in the
house, at 3s. a day and her tucker, to copy
the models obtained on approval from the
shops. Providing the retainer was suffi-
ciently skilful, elaborate dresses could also
be obtained and duplicated at moderate cost.
One of Melbourne’s short-lived social or-
ganisations was the N-Rays Club. It was
composed entirely of nice girls, and it would
probably have been clattering along now
only that half the members were captured,
matrimonially, in rapid succession, and
carried off from the debates, till the lamp of
knowledge was half-way to extinction. The
last debate of the club remains still unfin-
ished. It was on “The Lost Art of Conver-
sation,” and was carried on at full speed by
30 pairs of feminine lungs in excellent work-
ing order, ‘ till half the club hurried off for
the trousseau gathering, leaving the subject
undecided. Now about 15 new husbands
have to sit and listen to the theories and
doctrines that would have been aired at the
club if that institution had remained un-
married a little while longer.
AT POVERTY POINT.
“S.T.S.”: The copying of each other’s “business”
and “gags” by music-hall artists —of which The
Bulletin has iately complained —is definitely barred
by a clause in the general agreement of a body just
established. It calls itself “The World’s League of
Artists’ Organisations,” and has already roped in
some of the best-known English, French and Ameri-
can variety-performers’ societies.
The picture business that Hoyt started in Mel-
bourne three years back, is to be extended on branch
lines. When Hoyt’s Proprietary, Ltd., breaks out
in sundry places, the founder of the firm will have
the busiest dual identity in Melbourne. Hoyt, away
from St. George’s Hall, is Arthur Russell, the old-
established derttist, who has a conjurer’s pair of
hands, and is tooth-doctor-in-chicf to the profesh.
Once a showman always a showman. Dentistry is
the only work that Russell could have stuck at, out-
side a place of entertainment, because it calls for
tricky handicraft. He has stuck at it, and made a
lot of money at it, which is now earning lovely in-
terest in the picture spec. But once or twice in
time past Arthur Russell took a holiday from the
surgery, and ran himself in his capacity of wizard
for love of the thing. With J. A. Miller (after-
wards Melbourne manager of West’s) he went as far
as New Caledonia with a show.
When Hugh Ward was showing in Calcutta, an
aide notified that the Viceroy’s wife intended to pri-
vately visit the show on a given evening. Strict
secrecy was to be kept, so that anarchists, editors
and other mischief-makers should not take a hand.
But the seven Jews who owned the theatre were so
delighted with the honor, that they decided on a
private scheme of welcome. A roll of red carpet
was obtained, and placed so as to be unwound like
a flash on the lady’s arrival, and re-rolled before the
neighboring nigger bazaar could swarm. Also a
magnificent bouquet was put in a handy place, and
the seven descendants of the father of Moses each
took a sharp-toned whistle and posted themselves at
intervals between the castle and the theatre. As
her Ex. passed through the gateway in the carriage,
a long, shrill whistle split the darkness and startled
both her and the accompanying aide, and by the
time the theatre was in sight half a dozen progress
signals had terrified vice-regality into the certainty
that the bomb might be expected at any minute.
This fear reached its climax when an almost fainting
lady alighted from the carriage and endeavored to
side-step half a ton of charging velvet pile, and all
the Ikeys in the family. The performance brought
hundreds of niggers crowding into the entrance; the
audience stood on its neighbor’s hoof, and cursed in
20 dialects; the orchestra tried to quell the riot by
playing “Gor’ Save,” and all was dust and damn
and colored shirt-tail and diamond-studded Yids and
infuriated aide-de-camp. Ward doesn’t know to this
day what became of Minto’s lady.
“Blue Mask”': When bandmaster Sousa was in
Australia he made it clear to several people that he
wasn’t giving away complimentary tickets; but it
was not until he reached Maoriland that he published
his reasons. In reply to a definite question he
said: “People who get free tickets are the worst
section of an audience. The free-ticket man thinks
it is his privilege to be hypercritical and cynical, and
he very seldom applauds. If a person were to
advertise, a free concert, he would find that, after the
second item, a few people would leave; more and
more would leave after the third item; and in the
end about a third of the audience would remain to
see the concert out. When they pay they see the
show through. That is because you get a different
class of people,, the genuine lovers of music.” Which
seems to say that Sousa has had a different experi-
ence of the “dead-head” from Australasian managers.
In this part Qf the world, speaking generally, the
holder of a pass from the manager of a good show
remarks to his -friends: “Going down to Blank’s show
to-night. Old pal of mine. Insists on me running.
along when he’s got anything good.” And, inside,
the Australian “stiff” serves out his appreciation
lavishly, as a rule.
“Ring-in”: What is it that ' makes the melo-
dramatic orchestra conductor so utterly humorless?
It isn’t enough that the music of melodrama, is
mostly painful iteration—-a dozen bars repeated
until the happening Of something which must have a
new variation. If good music were played between
scenes, waits for new scenes would not bore so
much, and the “front” or “carpenters’ ” scenes,
which nearly always destroy the continuity of in-
terest of a play, would be unnecessary. Of course
most melodrama hasn’t any interest for which con-
tinuity is required, and, therefore, in those cases it
doesn’t matter. But it’s a pity with a mechanist’s
triumph, such as “Via Wireless” —a conventional
melodrama written round a fine effect. The orches-
tra’s humorlessness was all the more apparent when,
between the scene of the Mongolia picking up the
boats of the wrecked yacht, and the discovery of the
hero and the stupendous wreck effect, the band
played “A Life on the Rolling Wave,” with wild
variations. Reminded me of Mark Twain’s yarn of
the pianist vtho played to illustrate a picture of
the resurrection of Lazarus, “Then Rise Up, Willy
Reilly, and Come Along With Me!”
“J.F.I-I.” : Many Australian playgoers will remem-
ber “Yours merrily, John R. Rogers,” the husband
■‘and business-manager of the fair and fluffy Minnie
Palmer (“My Sweetheart”). His association with
Minnie closed some time ago, but when seen the
other day in London, he still had the same old
jovial signature and irrepressible energy. His prin-
cipal object in crossing the Atlantic is to exploit a
parachute he has invented for the salvation of air-
men, and, incidentally, to secure some new English
plays for his American patrons. John R.’s presence
in London naturally leads to remarks about* Minnie
P. One paper says “she made such a success in
‘My Sweetheart,’ while still a child, that she has
been playing nothing else for 30 years. She has
played it all ever the civilised world, and her por-
trait of that lovable little person is as fresh and
sweet as ever.” This scribe is a lover of the pure,
unadulterated truth, and he cannot conscientiously
declare that when he last saw Minnie in a London
suburban theatre, she looked quite as fresh and sweet
as when he first saw her in the Melbourne Bijou
nearly 25 years ago.
“Snell” : Never yet on stage or screen have I dis-
covered an actor-person who had even a remote
idea of how to wash a dish of dirt. They are the
same in the pictures as in the drama; the miner-
man scoops up a pinch of soil from any old place,
dips it in the stream, points excitedly to the centre
of the damp litter, and then executes an exuberant
fandango. He has struck it! I’ve seen red-shirted
diggers in an Australian drama washing prospects in
a pie-dish. It was in a Darrell play, I think, that
the hero said: “The dirt was full of nuggets. I
carefully panned off a dish, and got three pieces as
big as duck eggs!” That sort of man would hunt
for camels with a microscope.
“Snell” : Most actors have a pet phrase which they
ring in whenever opportunity offers. With some a
word suffices. One prominent actor, now operating
in Australia, is not happy unless he can work “On
my soui, no ! ” into a speech. There is another who
never fails to trot out: “And well you know, you
do.” When playing a part that allowed of the slight-
est departure info comedy, the late Alfred Dampier
strained any old situation to get in: “As good as
you are, and as bad as I am, I’m as good as you
are, as bad as I am.” At least 20 of Dampier’s
characters threw off that rather involved gag in my
hearing in the course of 10 or 12 years.
Says an Australian entrepreneur: “If we advertise
for chorus girls now, two-thirds of the applicants
are Jewesses. The profession is going over to the
sons and daughters of the Children of Israel. The
actors are now made up of two classes —those who
are Jews and those who are suspected of being
Jews.” In the face of this, how absurd appears the
familiar text: “Many are called, but few are
Chosen!”
“Theorbo”: One Dr. Flood, of Dublin, has written
a biography of Vincent Wallace, the composer of
“Maritana” and other operas. Wallace, pere, con-
ducted the orchestra in a Dublin theatre, and Vin-
cent played in it. He is said to have come to Aus-
tralia owing to a quarrel with his wife. Bourke, the
then Governor of N.S.W., befriended him, and he
managed to raise £lOOO for charitv with one con-
cert, which good deed made him solid with the “best
people” of the day. After some cheery and pros-
perous years in Sydney, he went to Maoriland, and
there a chief’s daughter is supposed to have saved
his life. Hence, “The Desert Flower” which ap-
peared after “Maritana.” From Maoriland he went
to India, and so on to Valparaiso, Callao, Lima and
Mexico, where he composed a popular mass. Thence
to London. “Maritana” came out in 1845, and was
an enormous hit, rivalling “The Bohemian Girl.”
Wallace’s only other great success was in 1860, with
“Lurline.” He thought “The Amber Witch” his best
work. Perhaps the libretto was bad. Anyhow, it
slumped. He spent much time in Germany, and died
in the Pyrenees, leaving a widow and two children
badly off. The widow was not his first wife, but a
jady of some reputation as a pianist.
THE KINDLY PRO.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
At our suburban boarding-house
There lives a nice, tall actor-bloke,
So kind he wouldn’t hurt a mouse,
So generous he’ll never joke
Of others’ weaknesses, nor say
A rude thing of another jay,
Nor scandalous remarks provoke.
The others may, with youthful guile,
Drag in an absent party’s name
To scoff, or injure, or revile.
This' actor scorns such deeds of shame —
. He only utters words in praise
Of clever deeds and pleasant ways,
And) gifts superior to blame.
He backbites neither man nor maid,
But tells of one who’d grace a throne,
Of great success, and tribute paid,
To genius of all men known.
No words of scorn or doubt he speaks. . .
In fact, for weeks, and weeks, and weeks,
He talks about himself alone!

Ran into “Smiler” Hales (who has forsaken the
Daily News and the tame environs of Fleet-street
for the greater excitement that is to be found in
South America) not many months ago in the sinful
city of Buenos Aires., He was then drawing the dol-
lars towards him by giving lectures on the Russo-
Japanese fight, and also by contributing articles on
spiritualism to the Standard, an influential English
newspaper in the Argentine capital. Over a mug of
rotten beer “Smiler” told me he was looking for
local color for a novel dealing with South American
life, which he intended writing. That novel, when it
appears, ought to be a hair-raiser, for local color in
South America is particularly vivid. “Smiler’s”

The late Major-General Hoad was a pro-
tege of The Bulletin’s old and lamented
friend, “Softgoods” Sargood, Melbourne’s
militant linen-draper. • It happened that Sar-
good, then Minister for Defence, was in the
habit of dressing at a window overlooking
the schbolyard in which young Hoad, already
something of an enthusiast on military mat-
ters, drilled an exceptionally smart corps of
small boys. While wrestling with the top
stud, Sargood, who was busy foster-father-
ing the cadet movement, took particular note
of the zeal of the young man in the yard, and
the fitness of his army, and the strapping
school-teacher was bumped up in the State
militia. He was the best evidence on record
of Sargood’s judgment.

and his Britannic Empire 1911.
The signature professes to be that of a
rather wealthy Sydney personage. As to
what he is driving at, this paper hasn’t a
suspicion. Anyone who thinks it has can
search the office.
“Silverleaf’s” inconvenient memory :
The Superior People who sneeringly refer to
Labah Ministers as —ah —boiler-makers and—er—
tradesmen, have a darned short memory. Long
before Labor was in the ascendant, quite a con-
siderable number of their own cherished leaders
were anything but scions of a noble aristocracy.
There was Henry Parkes, for instance, who humped
his bluey down the ’Bidgee, and washed sheep by
hand at intervals. That was before he established
himself as a toymaker and carver in Sydney. Then
there was David Buchanan, who used to knock
about Maitland, doing odd jobs, such as would
provide the wherewithal to buy a mutchin o’
whisky. Nor must we forget John (Jannery) Davis,
one time Postmaster-General in N.S.W., whose nick-
name was presented to him by The Bulletin in
commemoration of the colossal ignorance he displayed
when the late plain Bill Dailey, who defended The
Bulletin in a libel action Davis brought against
the paper, requested him to spell January. Next I
recall to memory the very superior and hard-shell
Tory, Henniker Heaton, who conveyed, in the early
60’s of last century, a diminutive Matilda to
Oberne station, near Tumbarumba, then owned by
Mr. Thomas Bardwell, and engaged himself to the
latter gentleman as cow-boy, at 10s. per week.
“Cow-boy Tom” was the name he was known by
at that time. Later on, he taught some cockies’
children in the bush, and canvassed for the Town
and Country Journal. Then there was Lucas, a
dealer in firewood, who made money, became a
Minister, and finished up as M L.C.; also. Jack
McElhone, whose mother sold mill; and many others
of a like humble origin. Coming down to the
“Liberals” of the present time, we find Joe Cook,
ex-coal miner and permanent Wowßer; J. J. Carrol; -
of the Lachlan, who carried a cheerful Matilda into
Ilillston ; and Jack Perry, once a shearer, and, the
writer believes, a paid delegate of the original Aus-
tralian Shearers’ Union. He was chairman of the
Labor League at Quirindi, but, finding that the
Labor people would not put him forward as their
candidate, he stood and was elected as an Inde-
pendent, about seven years ago. Incidentally, his
father went by _the name of Berry. Not that it
matters —it couldn’t make John any less competent
politically if his name was Jerry.
IN REMONSTRANCE.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
Surely a dignified reproof from one of our more
cultured legislators would do much to banish the
rowdyism so common in State Parliaments. Bris-
bane daily.
Brother, in a wild unhappy
Fit of fury didst thou call
On myself, in accents snappy,
’Fore the legislators all,
And suggest a fierce encounter just outside this noble
hall ?
Now, my style’s a trifle ton} - ,
And a vulgar bashing bout
With a legislative crony,
Who might chance to knock me out,
Would but soil the crest of gentry for the glory of a
lout.
And, in case, O brother bounder
I should smite that nose of thine,
And should make thee madly flounder,
And “Peccavi” sadly whine,
Pray—what lustre could the “scrap” bring to this
noble name of mine?
Is it fitting, is it proper,
That the People’s Chosen bash
At each other till the “copper”
In the melee makes a dash,
And prevents us getting ground-up in a pugilistic
hash ?
Shall he seize us by the trousers,
And the section called the scruff,
Like a pair of low carousers,
Or the lower type of “tough,”
And impound us in the station, just because we’re in
a huff ?
Brother! Drop thy lurid lingo,
And thy warlike fury, too,
Leave alope the fiery stingo
For a milder brand of brew.
Get a match with “Mistah” Johnson. Let “Mac”
make a Hope of you.
QUEENSLAND.

The Whiskyologist-
Who is he ?
WHO is the shrewd-looking, pleasant-faced old party
who has made himself so familiar to newspaper
readers under the name of the Whiskyologist, and
whose bull’s-eye questions brought the Whisky Importer to
his feet with a jump P
Is it a portrait of anyone in particular P Some people
have settled the question by identifying the picture with a
well-known Victorian public man, who has .from time to
time shown some of the: Whiskyologist’s traits in his deter-
mination to get to the root of certain matters, and his utter
refusal to be fooled.
In point of fact, the Whiskyologist isn’t intended for
any particular individual. The picture is the artist’s con-
ception of the clear-headed, middle-aged man of the world,
typically Australian in character, proud of the fact that the
home product is in every respect equal to the imported
article, and ready to prove it by his own experience.
The Whiskyologist wears Australian clothes, boots and
hats; he eats and drinks Australian food and liquor. He
made his money in Australia, and he spends it on
Australian-made products.
In the matter of Whisky he has the Commonwealth
Government guarantee to support his judgment in selecting
Joshua’s. The “G.R.” label on the bottle is the official
proof of age, purity and quality.
Follow the old gentleman’s example—he knows.

Self-Loading Shotgun, Model 1911
12 GAUGE
The Winchester Self-Loading Shotgun has all the good points of other recoil-
operated Shotguns and also many distinctive and exclusive features which
sportsmen have been quick to appreciate and endorse. Among them are Nickel
steel construction throughout, and a receiver made with the Winchester pat-
ented “Bump of Strength” which gives the gun surpassing strength and safety.
C. No readjustment of the gun is required for different loads. It shoots any
safe load from a “Blank” to the heaviest with certainty and safety without
tinkering the action. The recoil of this gun is divided, which makes it “kick” less and therefore pleasanter to shoot than
any other similar arm. It can be used with facility as a single loader, as the action can be locked so as to remain open
after any shot at the option of the shooter. There are no outside moving parts or any sharp corners or projections
to injure the hands, and the receiver is entirely free from screws or pins to jar out, or assembling holes to weaken it.
CL A two-part take-down system, with no loose parts to be left behind or lost, is used in this gun. When
taken down, the action is accessible for cleaning. In safety, reliability and shooting qualities, fhis new
model keeps pace with the established high Winchester standard. Look one over at your dealer’s.

IITIJ V are so many Clement-Bayards sold ? Well, for many reasons, some of which we men-
tion here —but the vital reason —the absorbing reason —the life and death reason —is
“the stuff that is in them, the wear-resisting materials, the specially prepared metals, the criti-
cally tested parts, the guaranteed components.”
A Clement-Bayard Car, small or large, has only the BEST of its kind in it —then every part
is drastically tested before the assembling; and so, when a man buys a Bayard, he feels he has a
machine that will stand up against hard wear—daily wear—and he knows he can trust his life to
the reliability of every part.
He knows that his Car will not recline at ease in the repairer’s hands half its time, and he
knows it will last half-a-dozen of the cheap machines being offered.
There are cheap Cars being sold that are merely castings, and got up to sell —Cars that it is
positively dangerous to trust life arid limb to.
Another reason for the popularity of Clement-Bayards is they are without doubt the simplest
of all cars to drive, and to maintain, and so the ordinary man (without a Chauffeur) can safely run
one.
Then, owing to their lightness (and yet great strength), they are very economical in up-
keep, light on tyres and naphtha.
Finally, they are 20 per cent, cheaper than any Car on the market —that is comparable with
them, for quality, finish and reliability.
CLEMENT-BAYARD CARS are made in all sizes from the
small 2-Cylinder up to the big 6-Cylinders.

PILLS
BRIGHTEN EXISTENCE.
It is not difficult to know when a mild aperient
is required. One feels dull and depressed; there is
acid in the stomach, oppression at the chest, numb
pain in the back, possibly a sharp attack of indigestion
or biliousness and headache.
Cockle’s Pills quickly dispel all such distressing symptoms of disorder,
cleansing the system thoroughly, restoring tone and stability to the whole
digestive apparatus, purifying the blood, and generally renewing normal
physical conditions as well as mental brightness. In a word, Cockle s Pills
brighten existence by keeping the body fit and well. The purer skin
and clearer complexion are the sure signs of it.
Of all Chemists, l/li and 2/9 per box.
Is the most perrect Preservative for the Skin
and Complexion, Invaluable for the SKIN
in HOT or COLD Climates, removing all
ROUGHNESS, IRRITATION and TAN
COOLING AND REFRESHING TO THE SKIN, KEEPING IT SOFT
AS VELVET ALL THE YEAR ROUND. VERY SOOTHING IF
APPLIED AFTER SHAVING

... EUCALYPTUS OIL
The Great Australian Remedy for
RHEUMATISM, COUGHS and COLDS.
Just Sit Down and Reason the Thing Out.
YOU say your scalp and hair are
in a most unhealthy condi-
tion. Your hair, which was
once admired by everybody, is now so
miserably thin and lustreless that
people commiserate with you, and ask
what has become of your beautiful hair.
Yes, you have used nearly every adver-
tised remedy to try and check its fall,
and to preserve its color, but they only
make it worse.
A Lady writes: —“A few months ago
I did what I ought to have done when
my hair first showed signs of deterior-
ating. Instead of wasting my time and
money on a lot of Quack Nostrums, I
consulted you, whom I had heard of
for years as being a Hair Specialist of
long standing in this country. I was
afraid your charge would be beyond
my means to pay. It was sheer neces-
sity at last which compelled me to visit
you. When I asked your charge, I
was agreeably surprised to find I had
nothing to pay beyond the price
charged for your remedies. These
were not more expensive than the
Quack Nostrums, and there was this
difference, whereas I spent Six Pounds
on those Nostrums, and got absolutely
no beneficial results (indeed, my hair
was getting less the longer I used,
them), one course of your treatment
removed the scurf and irritation from,
my scalp, and started a new growth
of hair. After six months’ treatment,
I am glad to say the effect is so marked
that my friends ask me what I am
doing to my hair. It is getting nice
and thick, and looks in a healthy con-
dition. I think your Shampuna a
lovely thing. I would not like to be
without it now. I have persuaded a
dozen of my friends to use it, and they
all speak most highly of it.”
Father Ryan writes: —“Dear Mr.
Holland, I am writing to you for an-
other supply of your excellent hair-
wash. I cannot speak too highly of
your hair restorer. It is the only gen-
uine stuff on the market. As I have
tried nearly all others, I think I am
competent to pass judgment. Please
send to the enclosed address one bottle
of Parasene Special, one box of Exemo
and three packets of Shampuna. The
latter is a splendid wash. I shall
never fail to recommend your treat-
ment as it justly deserves.'”
Mr. Kelly writes: —“I want you to
send me four months’ treatment of
Parasene and Cosmo. I want these
for a friend, who noticed how quickly
my hair grew under your treatment.”
Wonderful Testimonials can be seen
at my consulting rooms, proving that
my treatment is successful, if used for
a l’easonable time.
Scalps which have been nearly bald
for years are now growing a good,
healthy crop of hair.
Mr. Cummings writes from S.A.: —
“My hair is getting on first rate.”
Mr. Johnson writes from Queens-
land: —“I have used your treatment
for a few months and my hair is grow-
ing real good.”
Mr. Crosby, Sea Lake, Victoria,
writes: — a Two years ago I had no hair
on the top of my head; now, thanks
to your wonderful remedy, I have a
splendid crop of hair/’
Mr. Sheppard, Tasmania, writes: —
“I lost my hair, every bit of it,
when I was two years old, and I
have been quite bald for 15 years. I
have used dozens of preparations, but
they failed utterly to give me any hair.
Your treatment was brought under my
notice, and I am glad to say I am get-
ting a splendid crop of hair.”
Mr. Reynolds, of Launceston, came
to Melbourne to buy a wig. Before
doing so he was advised to consult me,
and, as a result of my treatment, he
has secured a good head of hair.
Constable Turner, of N. S._ Wales,
writes: —“A friend of mine was as
bald as a billiard ball, and wore a wig
for two years. He has now secured a
good head of hair, with your Special
Parasene and Cosmo.”
A Gentleman writes from Ravens-
thorpe (Q.) : “I have been troubled
with a most severe form of scalp
disease, and, although I have had the
best medical skill available, I was
never free from a terrible irritation
until I commenced a six months’ course
of your Parasene and Cosmo. I am
happy to say it is now quite cured. I
look upon the money spent on your
treatment as a most excellent invest-
ment.”
NATURALISE TESTIMONIALS.
Madam Yatohes writes from
Queensland: —“I have only used two
applications of your Natural ine, and
it has colored my hair perfectly. It’s
a beautiful thing.”
A Lady living at Gawler, S.A.,
writes: —“I have used your Naturaline
for over 12 years, and none of my
friends know I have a grey hair on
my head.”
A Lady writes from Wellington,
N.Z.: —I never thoiight it possible to
get a preparation which would color
my grey hair so perfectly as your
Naturaline does.”
Gentlemen whose hair is falling out
should use Special Parasene at
night and Cosmo in the morning, and
wash the hair once a week with Sham-
puna.
Price, by post, Victoria, two months’
treatment, 12/-; other States, 12/6 ;
four months’, 22/6 and 23/6.
Ladies troubled with falling hair
should use Restorer at night, and
Cosmo in the morning, and wash it as
often as necessary with Shampuna.
Price as above.
NATURALINE,
Nature’s Great Remedy for coloring
grey hair, beard and moustache. It
acts quickly, naturally and effectively,
and is guaranteed to be perfectly harm
less.
No. 1, for light brown hair; Medium
for medium brown hair. No. 2 for
dark brown, and a light black. Extra
Strong, for very black hair. Price,

ARE YOU
DEAF?
If you are deaf, or going deaf, you will
be glad to hear of a simple and scientific de-
vice which will restore your hearing, no mat-
ter how old you are. There is no mystery
or secrecy about it; we describe it fully and
explain just how it acts.
You use spectacles as sight magnifiers, and
in the same way you may use this sound
magnifier as an aid to weak hearing. But,
unlike spectacles, the Wilson Common-sense
Ear-Drums are invisible and comfortable.
You can’t tell you are wearing them. No
one else can, either, because they are not
seen.
They rest the ear nerves by taking the
strain off them —the strain of trying to hear
dim sounds. What a blessed relief to have
done with that tiring strain 1
Being made of the purest and softest Para
rubber, they cannot be felt, even when the
head rests on a pillow. For the same reason,
a blow on the side of the head will not hurt
the ear. In fact, they protect the ear, the
tender inner parts that are so sensitive, from
cold winds, dust, sudden and piercing sounds.
So that you may clearly understand why
these facts are true, and why the Sound Mag-
nifier restores the hearing, we give an illus-
tration of one as it lies in the ear. You will
notice that the Sound Magnifier is shaped
like a trumpet, and so conveys even the
faintest sounds right to the natural ear-
drum. Being of the softest rubber, it cannot
hurt the ear. It fits the orifice of the ear
with precision and comfort. The division
that runs across the mouth is to allow the re-
moval and insertion of the Ear-Drum, and to
brace it.
The shape of the Wilson Ear-Drum has
been chosen after years of experience as the
best adapted to carry the faintest sound right
down to the natural ear-drum.
To persons who are nearly deaf, it is not
only trying to have people shout at them,
but it hurts the ear-drum. When age comes
the ear-drum sometimes gets thickened, or
loses its tightness, and shouting does not act
properly on it. It only makes a confused
and tiring noise. But the Sound Magnifiers
concentrate the sound in the best spot for
perfect hearing.
Of course, if you have lost the hearing-
nerve completely, or were born deaf, we can-
not pretend to cure you. Only a miracle
could do that, in spite of some of the absurd
claims made to-day. But if you can hear the
faintest sound, do not despair. You will
never regret trying the Wilson Ear-Drums.
We have letters to show you from deaf people
in Australia and New Zealand who have been
cured, and you can be cured, too. You may
wear the Ear-Drums day and night, and take
them out whenever you wish. Children can
wear them (we have special sizes for. children
from six to twelve). Even a child can insert
and remove them without the least danger.
The price is £1 (the fee for a doctor’s
single visit). This includes a pair of Drums
(they are only sold in pairs), a fine nickel
remover and also an inserter. After the first
pair is bought you may purchase a single
drum at any time for Bs., but the pair you
get at first will last quite two years. Do not
ask for a trial pair. AVe do not send them
out on trial, and so they are never second-
hand. Use the Order Form below, and the
Outfit will be sent to you at once, with the
fullest instructions. Don’t delay, but have
the comfort of good hearing as soon as you
can.

1 — It uses cheap lamp oil (such as kerosene), and other residuals.
2 The oil is injected directly into the cylinder, thus dispensing with unre-

3 It is very simple in construction, there being no electric ignition or other
complicated mechanism.
4 Its speeds are such that electric generators and centrifugal pumps may

5 No skilled labor is required, the supply of fuel and lubricant being all

TRIAL
Those who are troubled with falling hair, dandruff,
baldness, itching scalp, etc., know full well the
humiliation that they cause. There is no need, how-
ever, of such conditions. These troubles can be
quickly overcome by my True Hair Grower.
I am not an advertising quack, but am a business
man. My hair began to grow thin about the time
I reached the age of thirty. When I had reached the
age of thirty-five the top of my head was quite bald.
I had considerable v pride, and sought for something
to cause renewed growth. I invested in every pre-
paration that I could see or hear of, and here let me
say that not only did I try all the 'English so-called
restorers, but those of Continental Europe. I also
visited specialists. My experimenting cost me many
sovereigns and considerable time —yet the hairs came
not. 1 had given up the idea of ever growing hair
again. One afternoon, while enjoying a brief busi-
ness respite by an Alpine trip, I fell in with an old
collegiate chemist, whose hair was, particularly plen-
tiful. I jokingly remarked that 1 wished he could
spare some of his hair for my benefit. This led him
to tell me that he understood the human hair as well
as a good dentist understands teeth. Me wrote out a
formula, and suggested that I have a quantity of the
compound prepared. 1 did this a few days later. I
was astonished to see the hair coining forth after
several applications, and within six weeks my head
was covered by a firm, yet soft, black growth of hair.
Since then the hair on my head has been as luxuriant
as when in my school days. Having arranged for
the legal right to do. so, .1 have for some time been
privately selling this marvellous hair-growing com-
pound. I bold over one thousand letters from people
who have actually grown new hair through the
medium of my true hair grower. Ido not pretend
to say it is the only hair grower in the world—l am
not interested in decrying others —but I do assert
that it is the most reliable, and in the end by far
the cheapest.
