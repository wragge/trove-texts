To stimulate the appetite, enhance the flavour of good food and aid digestion, is the function of a white table wine. Mildara
white table wines capture the subtle flavour and characteristic bouquet of Semilion and Riesling grapes. After controlled
fermentation, they are bottled when only a few months old, then mature to perfection in the bottle. MILDARA WHITE OPAL
is a new favourite—a dry white wine of Hock style, blended from the Semilion and Rhine Riesling grapes vintaged by
Mildara. GOLDEN BOWER, the name chosen for a wine made from the Riesling grape grown in the Hunter River Valley of
New South Wales. Each vintage is given a Bin Number so you can select your favourite year. Legend has it that a
returning Crusader brought with him from Persia the vines that eventually became known as Hermitage, growing
on the slopes of the Rhone River. Cabernet Sauvignon grapes originally came from Medoc in France and give
to claret a distinctive flavour and rare quality. Mildara makes three types of red table wine. HERMITAGE CLARET—
a special table wine blended by Mildara for everyday use, a wine of quality and good value available in bottles and flagons.
CABERNET SHIRAZ, a dry red wine made from the grapes it is named after. Grown in South Australia, at Coonawarra and
the Southern Vales, south of Adelaide—blended at Mildara and bottled as a vintage wine under distinctive Bin Numbers,
for instance 1963 is Bin No. 32. Mildara now has one of the largest Cabernet Sauvignon vineyards in Australia at
Coonawarra and new Cellars featuring modern techniques for the production of fine table wines. CABERNET SAUVIGNON,
1963, AND CABERNET SHIRAZ, 1963, vintaged at our Coonawarra Cellars from our Coonawarra vineyards, matured
in oak casks, bottled at two years, these fine red wines are Champions ahd will improve in bottle for many years.

Student Journalism
Sir,
Is is all too familiar to see criticism
of extreme Left-wing activities con-
demned, with extravagant emotive
language, as merely a neurotic pre-
occupation of the Radical Right. David
Salter’s letter (8., Nov. 26), defending
the Sydney University’s students’ news-
paper “Honi Soit,” and particularly its
issue just prior to President Johnson’s
visit, was simply the latest example. He
denounced THE BULLETIN as having
indulged in a “self-indignant and
moralistic frenzy which quite over-
shadows the worst of Goldwaterism”
for exposing the recent tone of “Honi
Soit.” Were it not for the fact that he
wrote as Director of Student Publica-
tions of the Students’ Representative
Council, his invective could well be
ignored.
He regarded as a “criminal and
deliberate distortion” Peter Samuel’s
omission of the fact that the front page
essay in the “Honi Soit” issued just
before Johnson’s visit was written by
the famous writer Jean-Paul Sartre.
Titled “Waiting for Lenin,” the essay
argued that the failure of the “socialist
camp” to threaten the U.S. “with
graduated reprisals of counter-escala-
tion is disheartening and tragic.” His
anxiety to emphasise that it was not
written within the university avoids the
point that its publication, so timed and
prominently featured, no doubt contri-
buted to the disgusting violence at the
anti-Johnson demonstrations. And the
fact that the author was an outsider
simply adds weight to the view that it
was published for the persuasive effect
the editor thought it might have.
Mr. Salter did not deny nor could
he, the fact, pointed to by Peter Samuel,
that in that same issue the editor
admitted that a series of completely
fabricated reports of alleged state-
ments by Professor David Armstrong
and Mr. David Stone had been used to
ridicule them. Neither could he deny
that there were other examples of anti-
American propaganda in that issue
without the slightest attempt at balance
by even a token presentation of other
views.
And then, Mr. Salter is the last who
should sanctimoniously complain about
the exclusion of relevant facts. By refer-

ring to the publication in “Honi Soit”
in May of a very long but uncut article
by Professor Armstrong, he invited the
inference that “Honi Soit” was really
not unfair to the Professor. It is signifi-
cant that he happened not to mention
that in June the SRC appointed a new
editor, Hall Greenland. The significance
of this is demonstrated by reference to
certain of Greenland’s political activi-
ties.
Since September, 1965, the SU ALP
Club (which later became the SU Labor
Club) has published weekly during term
a news sheet called “Wednesday Com-
mentary.” The March 2 issue announced
the organisation of a Medical Aid for
Vietnam Fund, and it described its pur-
poses as twofold: “one to aid victims
of the U.S. bombing and the other to
supply the Viet Cong.” This issue was
expressed as authorised by Hall Green-
land, as was the issue of April 20, which
stated that the fund had reached the
$lOO mark. Then the issue of June 22
“reprinted” a letter purporting to have
been signed by the “Chief of the South
Vietnam NLF Permanent Representa-
tion in the Soviet Union.” It thanked
“the group of socialists at Sydney Uni-
versity and Mr. Hall Greenland” for
their letter of “sympathy and support
to the people of Vietnam, who are
struggling against the U.S. imperialist
criminal war of aggression.” The letter
also purported to explain how money
and medical aid could be sent to the
NLF. The very next issue announced
that Hall Greenland, “one of WC’s
team of writers,” had been made editor
of “Honi-Soit.”
Greenland would have been foolish
had he made “Honi Soit” the same kind
of extreme Left-wing medium “WC”
has been, and so risk precipitating re-
taliation by the SRC. But even though
a little more subtle, it was soon recog-
nised as a platform of the Left Wing.
Being the last issue of the year, no
doubt Greenland felt free to reach the
peak of propaganda manifested in the
“Johnson edition.”
This still leaves the SRC to explain
its choice of editor and whether it
agrees with David Salter. It is incon-
ceivable that Greenland alone among
about 15,000 students could be found
to take the position and at the time of
his appointment his association with
“WC” must have been well known. The
unhappy recent experience must be an
object lesson, especially for the SRC to
maintain a responsible vigilance. More-
over, it owes itself, not to mention the
university and the body of students, a
prompt, clear declaration of its position.

A Pat for the Wales
Sir,
The reference to the closing of banks
in your instalment, of Michael Can-
non’s book “The Land Boomers” (8.,
Nov. 5), creates an erroneous impres-
sion. The passage in question reads as
follows:
“On Monday, May 1, 1893, men
picked up their morning papers to read
the incredible news that the colony’s
(i.e. Victoria’s) entire banking system
had apparently broken down. How-
ever, two banks, the Union Bank and
the Bank of Australasia, remained open.
The task of reconstructing the banking
system occupied several months while
trade languished and men starved.”
In condensing the book you have
omitted a vital sentence. In the book
Mr. Cannon says:
“. . . Two banks, however, refused
to obey the moratorium. The Union
Bank and the Bank of Australasia
remained open.”
The actual sequence of events was:
On Saturday, April 29, the National
Bank of Australasia Limited informed
the Victorian Premier of its intention
to suspend operations. Later the same
day, the National Bank told the other
banks of its decision.
On Sunday, April 30, the Victorian
Cabinet reached the decision to pro-
claim the following week “a bank holi-
day,” and obtained, urgently, the Act-
ing Governor’s signature to a procla-
mation to this effect. (This is the “mora-
torium” to which Mr. Cannon refers in
his book.)
The same day, the banks held a
midnight conference at the Union Bank,
where the Bank of Australasia and the
Union Bank declared their intention
to remain open and defy the proclama-
tion. The Melbourne manager of the
Bank of New South Wales was unable
to act without reference to his head
offic'e in Sydney. But the following day
(Monday) he sought permission to take
a course of action similar to that of the
Bank of Australasia and the Union
Bank.
The directors of the Wales refused
on the ground that they did not wish
to break the law. However, within 24
hours they changed their minds, and
the Wales, joining the other two in
defying the proclamation, opened for
business on Tuesday, May 2. The
Wales did not close at all in the other
States.
These facts are confirmed by the
records of the Bank of Australasia and
of the Wales. All told, 19 banks closed
during the crisis, and of these 13 sus-
pended payment for reconstruction pur-
poses for periods varying from 30 to
128 days. Of today’s surviving banks,
only three, the ANZ Bank (an amalga-
mation of the Bank of Australasia and
the Union Bank), the Bank of Adelaide,
and the Wales, did not suspend pay-
ment. As the Wales, in nearly 150 years’
existence, has never closed its doors on
a normal Working day, you may con-
sider publishing these facts.

Racial Prejudice
Sir,
I write to support Kenneth Grenville’s
call (8., Nov. 19) for a public renun-
ciation of the racialism, real or
apparent, in our migration policy. Most
Australians do not discriminate against
colored people on the basis of color. I
use as an example Wilcannia, a river
town in western N.S.W. where part-
Aborigines make up half the total popu-
lation. The attitude of the “white” resi-
dents toward the “darkies” (the distinc-
tion has been forced upon us) is not a
uniform one. If a man is a “good
worker” and a “decent liver” his skin
color is irrelevant, he is accepted as a

member of the society that he shows
willingness to be part of. If a lady
tries to keep her house tidy, her children
presentable, she is welcomed by those
with similar desires. It does not matter
to the other members of church or
social clubs, community or sporting
bodies whether they are “black” or
“white.” What matters is do they want
to be part of a white way of life, and
are they able and willing to accept the
obligations as well as the benefits of
that way of life? That it is impossible
to enjoy the benefits without assuming
the obligations accounts for the large
numbers of part-Aboriginal drop-outs
from white society.
In this town colored people are
treated according to what they make of
life (some would say according to what
life makes of them), not just according
to their skin color. Now that should be
our attitude toward prospective Asian
migrants. If differential treatment is to
be shown because of economic or social
reasons, let them be the reasons, and
not irrelevant considerations of skin
color. The prejudice of racialism comes
with a generalisation to all colored
people of the unpleasantness encoun-
tered in contacts with some colored
people. It is this using color as a badge
to identify and label all of a race as
birds of .a feather that must not be
allowed to remain in our dealings with
people of other races within or outside
our country.

Dialogue on “ Dissent ”
Sir,
Mr. Samuel portrays himself (8.,
Oct. 29) as, among other things, a
moderate man of good intentions, seek-
ing, in the face of unmerited abuse, to
engage in genuine dialogue over Viet-
nam. But his account of the con-
troversy in “Dissent” is so selective as
to be bizarre. Two paragraphs of his
letter were devoted to an unashamed
misrepresentation of my comments on
Vietnam, and an angry whinge about
being criticised. All I can do here is
to refer readers to the relevant issues
of “Dissent” —numbers 14, 15, and 16.
On the supposed history of the Viet-
nam debate in “Dissent,” Mr. Samuel
refers to my “Warring in Vietnam” as
the first piece on the war to be pub-
lished in the journal, and an indica-
tion of its degeneration. In fact, while
he was co-editor, he solicited from me
and, as far as I could tell, approved of
the content of a critical article headed
“Buddhists in Revolt.” (“Dissent,”
Summer, 1963). Perhaps Mr. Samuel
has stood his ground less than he be-
lieves. And this is nothing to be aggres-
sively self-defensive about, or something
for which others should be abusively
condemned. Views change, because of
new situations, or greater knowledge
of relevant facts, or for many other
reasons.
I claimed, in replying to Mr. Samuel
in “Dissent,” that he was a “poor friend
of liberty.” The claim arose from his

polemical technique, and many of his
later letters and articles give rise to
the same feeling. He appears unable to
grasp the fact that his opponents are
sincere—that over Vietnam, for
example, fundamental disagreements are
both genuine and reasonable. He
prefers malicious assaults on the
integrity of others, and amateurish
attempts at their psychological classi-
fication. This was the basis of my
original claim.
Finally, I do hope that, before Mr.
Samuel throws around further charges
of hysteria and abusiveness, he would
pay some attention to the beam in his

GRAEME DUNCAN
Clayton (Vic.)
Sir,
As the person chieflly responsible for
founding “Dissent” and sustaining it
during the first two years of publication,
I should like the opportunity of
strongly supporting the present editor,
Mr. Glezer, against the attacks on
him and on his editorship of the
journal. Mr. Glezer’s letter (8., Oct.
8) dealt adequately with most of the
charges made against “Dissent” and
himself, but I should like to add a
couple of points of my own.
1. Mr. Buckley (8., Aug. 13) makes
sweeping and serious charges against
a whole cluster of journals on, at least
in “Dissent’s case, the most flimsy evi-
dence. What evidence? Two short
quotes from one issue of that journal!
On this basis “Dissent” (as part of the
Left) is said to display “serious de-
ficiency in . . . intellectual and emo-
tional equipment”; to go in for
“. . . posturings, evasions, and culpable
betrayals”; is guilty of “wilful misun-
derstanding of frequently repeated
American objectives in Vietnam” . . .
and other deficiencies which collec-
tively constitute a “moral and intel-
lectual disgrace!”
On this kind of “analysis” even THE
BULLETIN would have Buckley’s
chance of getting an anti-Communist
guernsey.
2. Mr. Evans’ (8., Sept. 17) claims
that “the basic proposition to which
‘Dissent’s’ founders were committed was
that ‘Dissent’ was to be a focus for
anti-Communist Left-wing discussions
and polemics.” This was certainly not
my conception of the journal’s raison
d’etre, as can easily be confirmed by
reading the editorials of the first six
issues. One thing “Dissent” emphati-
cally did hope to become was a
“journal open to anyone who is con-
cerned about the society in which we
live.” (First “Dissent” editorial, July,
1961—emphasis mine). It also rejected
the “clique and faction thinking that
has become unfortunately the mark of
so much of the Australian intellectual
and political world” (same editorial),
and in a later editorial it declared that
it had been started, among other
things, to meet the need for a journal
where discussions could take place on
important issues free from the “vicious
ideologising” that too often is found in
such journals as THE BULLETIN and
“Outlook,” not to mention the
“Guardian” and “News Weekly.” Mr.
Evans’ false and grossly unfair remark
on Mr. Glezer in his last paragraph
reveals how quickly a so-called “tough
mindedness,” masquerading as political
maturity, leads to the inability to dis-
tinguish between mere abuse and poli-
tical analysis.
3. Mr. Samuel (8., Oct. 29) in a
most misleading paragraph claims first
that he was, like Mr. Evans and Mr.
Buckley, one of the group that founded
“Dissent” and then, on the basis of
these remarks, assures us that he can
speak with some authority in saying
that “Dissent” under Mr. Glezer’s
editorship “is not living up to the
thoughts that inspired it until recently.”
Firstly, Mr. Samuel played a negligible
part in the founding of “Dissent,” as
did Mr. Buckley. Later Mr. Samuel
with Mr. Glezer was responsible for
making “Dissent” into a really national
and professional journal. Mr. Evans
did most useful work on the distribu-

tion side but had virtually nothing to
do with the content of “Dissent”! I
can only say emphatically that I, at
least, regard the present “Dissent” as
living up to some of the central
thoughts that moved me to try to found
it. As for the rest of Mr. Samuel’s
letter, most of it represents the kind of
writing “Dissent,” at least to my mind,
was brought into existence to try to by-
pass.
Finally, perhaps, it would be a good
idea if all of us, before we publish on
crucial issues such as Vietnam and
world peace, consider whether what we
have described in others as cowardice,
self-seeking, failures of nerve, ideologis-
ing, wilful blindness, etc., is not, per-
haps, capable of being more accurately
described as honest assessments, made
by men of integrity whose judgments
of the facts and whose weighting of
legitimate consideration are different
from our own.
PETER WERTHEIM
Brisbane (Q.)
FEDERATION
86 Years Ago: December 11, 1880
ir pHE results of the recent Federal
Conference in Melbourne have
shown that the South Australian
Premier was perfectly right when he
wrote that it was easier to dabble in
magnificent theories than to give
practical effect to them. The actual
achievements of the Conference may
be reckoned as nil. The feasibleness of
Federation appears at first consider-
ation to have been shown to be more
remote than had been conceived
prior to the conflict of ideas which
the Melbourne Conference evoked.
But it seems at least possible that the
effect will not be to relegate Feder-
ation to the indefinite future. A Fed-
eration of which the basis shall be an
assimilation of tariffs and excise duties
has been clearly shown to be unattain-
able at present. But that fact should
not be allowed to block the way. On
the contrary, the recognition of such
an insuperable stumbling-block should
merely set people thinking whether it
would not be possible to get round
it leave it standing and yet
reach Federation after all. It wodld
be possible to approach very near to
Federation without a Customs union.
The business of the next Confer-
ence will be to evade difficulties while
accomplishing possibilities. The rep-
resentatives of the several colonies
will best prove their loyal desire to
approach Federation by avoidance of
subjects upon which agreement is
known to be hopeless. They will be
under no obligation to enter upon
such discussions as the one started
by that organ of Victorian spread-
eagleism, the Melbourne “Age.” The
“claims” of Victoria to Riverina, as
advanced by that Journal, and the
cool indifference of N.S.W. to any
sort of Federation, as reported by
the “S.M. Herald,” will alike be ex-
asperating matters best left alone.

Indian Summer
\IITHILE each Indian summer
" ’ monotonously brings news of
crop failures, famine, and cries for
foreign assistance, the temptation to
despair of India’s problems is an
easy one to succumb to. This year
the outlook is even more depressing
as the fabric of Government wears
thinner and street rioting and
police shooting become almost
daily occurrences. To top it all—
from the point of view of the
sceptical foreigner —. there is the
tragic irony in hungry men
demonstrating in order to gain legal
protection for the tens of millions
of parasitic holy cows.
Even if this sort of news picture
is an unfair caricature, India is
nevertheless paying dearly for its
past failures failure to promote
birth control, to extend agriculture,
to encourage foreign private in-
vestment, to abandon the late
Mr. Nehru’s obsessive attachment
to Soviet theories of the importance
of heavy industry. Some of these
policy deficiencies are now being
remedied: family planning is being
pushed along; agricultural services
are being expanded; several large
fertilizer plants are being built by
American business; and more
money is going into agriculture. But
the yields will not appear for at
least two or three years, and mean-
while India is certain to need at
least 10 million tons of food grains
a year.
It is quite within the capacity
of the world’s wheat producers to
provide this (our own exportable
surplus this year, for example, will
be almost 10 million tons) but,
unfortunately, the most important
donor, America, is showing signs
of growing tired of carrying the
burden alone. Last year the
Americans handed the Indians one
quarter of their total wheat harvest
of 45 million tons for nothing; now
their stocks have run down and the
U.S. Congress is sceptical of the
value of lavish hand-outs.
Such pressure on India could
not come at a worse time. Several
million people in the states of Bihar
and Gujerat face death by star-
vation and Indian domestic politics
between now and the elections in
February will be increasingly tense
and critical. The overriding
question is whether or not Indian
political life will be disrupted by
street violence, religious extremism,
and inter-State rivalries. While
a famine, made worse by foreign
callousness, will make this sort of
disruption so much more likely,
generous and immediate food aid
would help avert it.
Foreign aid must not be seen as
an attempt to preserve the political
and economic status quo in India.
It may well be that India needs a
new Prime Minister, that it would
be better if the fumbling Congress
Party were to split into two wings,
and that an alliance of the moder-
ate Congress elements with the
pragmatic Swatantra and Praja
Socialist parties would give better
government. But the real issue is
not whether the status quo is to be
preserved, but whether India is to
be in a position to change .its
policies in conditions of peace and
freedom. Australia has politic-
ally vested interest in preserving
Indian freedom and any economic
aid that will promote this will be
politically cheap as well as a com-
pulsory humanitarian gesture. We
should have no difficulty in finding
the money for half a million tons of
wheat, and the Government should
do so immediately.


THIS AUSTRALIA
Men y. Machines (ALP)
From ALAN REID in Canberra
A power struggle, which is far more important than the looming leadership
struggle between Mr. Whitlam and Dr. Cairns, has broken out for control of the
ALP machine and will decide the future of the Federal Parliamentary Labor Party.
In the present set-up it is the people
controlling the ALP machine who
run the Labor Party, not the Parlia-
mentary leader. Moderate Federal and
State Parliamentarians and trade unions
have belatedly awakened to the realisa-
tion that it does not matter whether a
Whitlam - Cairns, Whitlam - Patterson,
Cairns-Whitlam, or some other com-
bination takes over Labor’s Parliament-
ary leadership from Mr. Calwell.
In an extraordinary prophetic warn-
ing, Mr. Allan Fraser, himself near
defeat in the landslide Government win
portrayed what was likely to be the fate
of the Labor Party if it continued on the
disastrous course it was then pursuing.
Mr. Fraser gave his warning on Febru-
ary 20 this year, when he was defying
the authority of the Federal ALP
executive, Labor’s 12-man strong
supreme governing body between bi-
ennial conferences. In his broadcast,
Mr. Fraser said, “It is necessary to
realise that in this crisis the Labor
Party is not simply liable to a big de-
feat at the coming election.
“The position is more serious than
that. For the first time in my experi-
ence the survival of the Labor Party as
an effective Parliamentary force is
doubtful. This follows the actions of
the Federal executive (in insisting upon
the complete subjection of Labor
Parliamentarians to the authority of
the ALP machine). The Communist
aim is to destroy the Labor Party so
as to clear the way for its own suc-
cess. They (the Communists) would
be helped by a position in which the
Labor Party was so heavily defeated
that only a handful of members from
industrial strongholds would form the
Labor Party in the ensuing Parlia-
ment. The aim of these outside men
... is that there would be a Parlia-
mentary group, dependent entirely on
pre-selection and not on election, who
would be the mouthpieces of those gain-
ing control of the ALP machine. The
creation of a Parliamentary platform
for expounding extreme views would
replace the object of winning Gov-
ernment, and concern for public
opinion would no longer be import-
ant.”
This, in effect, is what has happened.
Against this background, the struggle
for the Labor Parliamentary leadership
becomes merely the showpiece, while
the much more fundamental struggle
is taking place within the ALP machine.
I see several important developments
so far in this Parliamentary-ALP
machine struggle:
• The Opposition Leader, Mr. Cal-
well, has called a meeting of the Federal
Parliamentary Labor Party caucus for
the first week in February. He gave
no indication as to whether or not he
would honor his undertaking to step
down from the leadership if Labor was
defeated.
• The ALP president, Senator J.
Keeffe (Qld.), denied that he would be
seeking the expulsion from the ALP of
the present deputy, Mr. Whitlam, at
the Federal executive meeting this week.
Unless there is a change in the ALP
machine set-up, Mr. Whitlam, of neces-
sity, must be a “mouthpiece” for the
outside forces to which Mr. Fraser re-
ferred, whatever future post Mr. Whit-
lam occupies in the Parliamentary
Labor Party.
• Mr. Kim Beazley, who has moved
on to the W.A. ALP executive, is mak-
ing no secret that his aim is to change
the ALP Federal machine set-up, and
that he intends to contest the Labor
leadership at the February caucus meet-
ing.
• Pressure is intensifying from Par-
liamentarians and moderate trade
unionists in South Australia for S.A.’s
two delegates to the ALP Federal
executive to join up with N.S.W. and
forces in Western Australia and Tas-
mania against the Left-wing and Com-
munist - influenced Victorian ALP
executive.
• The S.A. Parliamentarians realise
that on the Federal figures the S.A.
Labor Government is doomed, the
Premier, Mr. Walsh, would have diffi-
culty in holding his seat, and the ALP
in S.A. would also be reduced to the
handful of members from industrial
seats.
• Moderate S.A. trade union lead-
ers have realised that sectarian bitter-
ness that exists in that State have been
exploited skilfully to align them with
extremist elements within the ALP,
particularly in Victoria.
• The Left-wing controllers of the
Victorian ALP executive realise that,
though their forces have won control
of the Parliamentary Labor Party, a
genuine “grassroots” ALP hostility is
developing against them and the foreign
policies they have been big factors in
successfully forcing upon the Parlia-
mentary Labor Party.
• In the belief that if they can hold
on long enough this “grassroots” re-
volt will lose its momentum, the ALP
Left-wingers are desperately anxious to
persuade Mr. Calwell to remain as a
member of the Victorian ALP execu-
tive. The Left-wing Victorians are
working on the assumption—justified by
Right-wing weakness and vacillation
over recent years—that the Right-wing
will not have the ruthlessness to act
against an executive which numbers an
ex-Federal Labor leader in its ranks.
Once the emotionalism arising from
Labor’s election disaster is exhausted,
the Left-wingers believe —probably
accurately—that they will be able to re-
assert their control over the ALP
Federal machine and establish through
this ALP machine the type of control
over the Parliamentary Labor Party that
Mr. Fraser foresaw in his February 20
broadcast.
Mr. Fraser has also been justified in
his warning that, with the ALP machine
under its present control, mass violence
could develop. In the final week of the
election campaign, the Prime Minister,
Mr. Holt, was subjected to violence of
the ugliest kind at the Rockdale meet-
ing—the first Prime Minister in Aus-
tralian history to be physically assaulted
not by an individual but by a mob on
a public street.
At the time Mr. Fraser broadcast his
warning, he said that it was more
pleasant to believe that mass violence
could not happen here. But, he added,
“it had happened elsewhere by similar
strategy.” Against this background, it
is easy to see why the power struggle
within the ALP Federal machine is in
the long-term of far more significance
than the showier but less meaningful
struggle between what in effect are only
puppets, as far as their non-machine
roles are concerned, for the Federal
Labor leadership.
On the Donkey’s Back
An analysis of the results of the recent election (as they looked last week) showed
that as many as 16 of the 123 seats in the House of Representatives would be held
by different candidates were it not for the donkey vote.
Ten ALP members would not have
won, and six Liberals. Probably
Messrs. Costa, Curtin, Beaton, Court-
nay, Cairns, Cross, Gray, Ditmer,
Nichols, and Cameron of the ALP
have only the donkeys to thank for their
places in the 26th Parliament. On the
Liberal side, Messrs Arthur, Dobie,
Erwin, Lee, Jones, and Jessop are
donkey-sponsored.
Mr. Allan Fraser only held his seat
of Eden-Monaro in 1958 and 1963 on
the donkey vote, and if he manages to
scrape home again this time it will
only be on the donkey’s. Mr. Leslie
Bury only beat an Independent Liberal


rival for his seat of Wentworth in the
by-election of 1956, thanks to them.
So donkey voting represents an im-
portant defect in our electoral system.
We must hope that the Minister for
the Interior, Mr. Anthony (despite his
surname), will make some move to
eliminate its effect.
To explain, take a Sydney telephone
book and you will find that sub-
scribers’ names are equally distributed
on either side of the Josephsons. Mel-
bourne isn’t very different. Its middle
man is one of the Johnsons, only a
couple of pages away. But our parlia-
mentarians are a weird crowd—in their
names at least. In the last Parliament,
for instance, you might have expected
to find Mr. Les Johnson halfway down
a list of MPs ranked by alphabet. In
fact, he was two-thirds of the way
down.
IT could be said that we “post-Js” who
represent half the Australian popu-
lation are represented by only 43 poli-
ticians whereas the privileged “pre-Js”
the other half have 80 to speak
for them. Look at the inside back page
of any copy of Hansard and note the
plethora of men with names beginning
with A, B, C, and D. Forty-eight of
the 123 in the new Parliament will
probably have names starting A to D.
There will be only about 20 people
from N to Z.
This alphabetical bias in the elect-
oral system arises from the ranking of
candidates on the ballot paper in
alphabetical order, and the practice of
a large number of irresponsible voters
of voting 1,2, 3, etc., down their ballot
paper. Somewhere between one per-
cent and three percent of voters lodge
such a “donkey vote.” This means that
in the average electorate of 50,000
voters we can usually expect around
1000 donkey votes, a very good wind-
fall indeed for the lucky highest alpha-
bet candidate. The small men of poli-
tics provide clear examples of the size
of the donkey vote. Take the five
servicemen who recently stood for the
seat of Mitchell only in order to gain
premature discharge from military
service. On the last count to hand
Messrs. Deecke, Jones, Martin and
Rees had polled 275, 284, 228, and
264 while their colleague Mr. Bonnor
had got 2043.
And take the personal history of a
veteran minority candidate, the presi-
dent of the Australian Republican
Party. As John Murray, in 1961, in the
electorate of Balaclava he was fortu-
nate enough to have Messrs Platz, Ryan,
and Whittorn as rivals and he got
1780 votes or 2.27 percent of the total.
In 1963 he stood for Maribyrnong,
where he was pushed down the list by
a Mr. Armour and Mr. McManus, and
on this occasion he polled a mere 141
votes, or 0.31 percent of the total. Be-
ing an enterprising man he changed his
name for the 1966 elections and stood
as Mr. John A’Murray. Back at the
top of the ballot paper again, he has
the donkeys working to save his deposit
and on the latest count (this time he
is standing in Higginbotham) he has
1372 votes.
the effects of the donkey vote
are not trivial, as such explanatory
examples might suggest. Thus, Mr.
Whitlam must be acutely aware of some
of the implications, and not merely be-
cause his name is becoming an impor-
tant handicap now that his seat has
become less secure for Labor. His great
rival, Dr. Jim Cairns, is only back in
Parliament on the donkey vote. Indeed,
he would not have been elected on his
first try in 1955 had it not been for
that.
What is the solution?
The Chief Electoral Officer, Mr.
Ley, favors a lottery draw for ballot
paper positions. This would still allow
the donkey vote to favor candidates
who had the luck of the draw, but it

McWILLIAM’S Private Bin 56
1965 Lexia
This is a light, dry, white table wine made
from the grape variety known as Lexia,
and was produced at McWilliam's Robin-
vale Winery in Victoria. During fermen-
tation the temperature was maintained
below 55° F., and this has helped to retain
in the wine a very powerful aroma of the
grape, as well as a tremendous volume of
flavour. An ideal accompaniment to most
foods, particularly seasoned fish dishes,
white meats and poultry. It was awarded
a Gold Medal at the 1966 International
Wine Fair held at Ljubljana, Yugoslavia.
McWILLIAM’S Private Bin 35
1963 Claret
The Hermitage grapes used to produce
this wine were picked exclusively from
our Hanwood Vineyards in the Riverina
district of New South Wales. Here, con-
trolled irrigation, accompanied by special
pruning techniques, helps to produce
grapes which give a “claret styte,” light
and delicate, but at the same time full
of flavour of the fruit and with a firm
tannin finish.
It was awarded a Silver Medal in the
International Wine Fair at Ljubljana,
Yugoslavia, in 1966.
McWILLIAM’S Private Bin 66
1965 Moselle
With its fragrant aroma and its delicate
fruity flavour, both enhanced by a slight
effervescence, this wine has the charac-
teristic qualities expected in a good
Moselle. These qualities make it most
suitable for serving with fish, salads and
all light dishes.
In the Queensland Royal National Show
of 1966, it was awarded a Bronze Medal
in the Vintage 1965 Medium Dry White,
Moselle Class.
McWILLIAM’S Private Bin 14
1963 Burgundy
Made from a blend of Hermitage and
Grenache grapes grown in the Riverina
District of N.S.W., this wine has the deli-
cate aroma of the fruit, is full-bodied and
has a soft, round palate.
It is an ideal accompaniment with meat
dishes and cheese.
In the Queensland Royal National Show
of 1966 it was awarded a Bronze Medal
in the Dry Red Table (Export) Class.
would eliminate the present systematic
and chronic bias of the system in favor
of the people with high alphabet names.
It would stop the practice of the
political parties giving preference to the
Bs and the Cs over the Rs and the
Ss in their pre-selection procedures.
This is where most of the bias originates.
A better system would be to eliminate
the donkey vote itself somehow. One
way to do this would be to abolish the
compulsion in voting, though this raises
other issues. Another way would be to
arrange the names of candidates in a
circle or square so that there would be
no line for the donkeys to follow down.
It could be done on conventional
ballot papers. Or it could be linked to
the introduction of mechanical voting.
This involves one large central com-
puter to process information transmitted
by telegraph line from simple punch
card devices in each polling booth.
We would have all our results by about
8.15 on Saturday night (with the ex-
ception of late absentee votes). The
computer would secretly keep a con-
tinuous tally as votes came in through
the day, and all it would have to do
after the polls closed would be to check
its work, and print out its electroni-
cally stored results.
IBM already has a man in the U.S.
looking at mechanical voting systems
in use there, with a view to designing
one to suit Australian voting. With our
complicated preferential and propor-
tional methods, computerisation makes
even more sense than over there, where
the first-past-the-post method is used.
As well as exterminating the donkeys,
some $BOO,OOO of salaries and 40,000
man-days would be saved. Though a
few commenators would be out of
business.
Quiet Lee
Mr. Mervyn Lee is going quietly
about his drapery business in Broadford,
a small town 40 miles north of Mel-
bourne, and wondering who will look
after the business if he has to go to
Canberra next year to represent the
seat of Lalor in the House of Repre-
sentatives.
Much to his own surprise and that of
most others, Labor front-bencher Mr.
Reg Pollard has lost his former abso-
lute majority of 9000 votes and with a
normal drift of preferences will lose his
seat.
When Mr. Lee nominated for Lalor
he had few or no thoughts about win-
ning and having to drag up to Can-
berra. He ran the gentlest of election
campaigns, called no public meetings,
and was utterly unassisted by any
Ministers or Government Members. His
only promise was that if elected he
would travel around the electorate and
discuss people’s problems.
Meanwhile, in the seat of Yarra,
only a couple of miles from the G.P.0.,
Dr. Cairns fights for preferences for the
first time. He should get enough to
win, and, unless the Liberal Party
applies successfully to the Court of
Disputed Returns about the Liberal
Reform ticket which was used to sup-
port Cairns and about allegations of
faked votes, Dr. Cairns will be a candi-
date for Labor leadership.
Most commentators give much of the
credit for the 3000 vote reduction of
Cairns’ majority to the lively “Ameri-
can-style” campaign run by the Liberal
candidate Mr. Leo Hawkins. Mr.
Hawkins, like most young Liberals, is
a keen student of both market research
and the political techniques of the
machine of the late John F. Kennedy.
His election campaign was thoroughly
planned. The electorate was surveyed
and the results carefully analysed. It
was discovered that most voters were
unaware of the name of the sitting
Member, so the temptation to run an
anti-Cairns campaign was resisted.
Cairns was mostly ignored and the
weight of Liberal strategy was directed
to promoting the name and image of
Hawkins.
r p : HE strategy was cleverly successful,
and with the aid of posters,
pamphlets, microphones, the Prime Min-
ister, some antipathetic local toughs,
balloons, rattles, boaters, and incessant
door-knocking the name and English
accent of Leo Hawkins became features
of life in the district. Whether it made
any difference to the vote is hard to
say. All we can be sure of is that those
who voted Liberal knew whom they were
voting for. Those who voted Labor
knew whom they were voting against.
Mr. Lee over in Lalor must be wonder-
ing why Hawkins went to all the
trouble.
“American-style” was the term fre-
quently used during the campaign to
describe the activities of the more
enthusiastic candidates, but there is not
much evidence that American election
tactics were widely used or understood.
The best campaigns, such as that run by
Mr. Ray Evans, campaign secretary for
Captain Benson in Batman, used
surveys to find the areas to reach and
abandoned public meetings for personal
contact. However, there was not much
barnstorming or glad-handing. March-
ing girls were neglected and attempts
at float parades mostly ended in fiasco.
Television still seems to be an embar-
rassment to the political parties. They
know they must use it, but show little
sign of knowing how. The Government
went through with a TV routine, but it
was an old act and unpolished, the
DLP directed its television effort at the
kiddies’ vote —and the kids thought the
rockets were beaut, and the ALP, apart
from the pleasant case made by Mr.
Whitlam for a better deal for every-
body, px'obably scared people into vot-
ing against it: it tried to use fear to
promote its foreign policy and the plan
backfired. However, Mr. Pollard will
no doubt acquaint his party with, the
“sophisticated” techniques of Mr.
Mervyn Lee.

The outstanding features of the New

and Labor, the large number of voters
who abstained, and strong showing of
the Social Credit League as a third

The League polled almost 15 percent

the first candidate in more than 20

League savagely cut many majorities,
including those of some Cabinet
Ministers. Twelve seats of the House’s
80 are now held with margins of less
than 1000 votes.
Naturally commentators are asking
why 15 percent of the electorate turned
on the National Government and found
Labor no alternative. Mr. Cracknell’s
evangelical message, “Join the swing to
Social Credit,” was hardly a rally-
ing cry. Perhaps unwittingly he plucked
at the “populist” prejudices of New
Zealanders, not only attacking New
Zealand’s “debt - ridden monetary
system” but claiming it is controlled
by a small clique of international
bankers. He blamed increased prices
and taxation on both the system and
the trend toward monopoly in the
economy. He raised the overseas invest-
ment bogy; said immigration should be
restricted to those of European stock;
and personally “had a great deal of
sympathy for Mr. Smith in Rhodesia.”
These emotive emphases found a re-
sponse in an electorate probably tired of
the status quo (the National Party has
been in Government 14 of the past 17
years). There is genuine disquiet over
the economy, where the Government
has been reluctant to check internal
demands to ease overstrain. In a period
of record income New Zealand’s over-
seas reserves are at a record low. The
Government has been using heavy bor-
rowing to offset the effects of increased
imports.
on the other hand, has been
accused of being dominated by
trade-union pressure groups. Nor has
Labor’s current leader, Mr. Kirk,
created much impression on TV or
gained a good Press. After being a dash-
ing debater of the back benches he
became quite timid when reseated at
the front. Labor also concentrated its
appeal on specific groups rather than
seeking broader appeal.
What is Social Credit’s future? Its
most marked gains were made in the
northernmost rural districts of the
North Island. As well as holding Hob-
son it is now second party and Labor
third in three other electorates. In
another two its share of the votes is
similar to Labor’s. In the northern
region the League’s policies register
with low-income farmers, small shop-
keepers, and other dissatisfied groups
with all the impact Poujade registered
in France some years ago.
The League, with this regional base
of electoral support, has better chances
of expansion than any previous third
party in New Zealand’s recent history.
A lot will depend on Mr. Cracknell’s
behaviour in the House. He enjoys a
unique position. For what is to stop
him supporting in debate or in division
only those policies he considers expedi-
ent. Will he be shrewd enough to do
this, or will his Right Wing leanings ex-
pose him as being little more than a
successful eccentric? Certainly the
voters of Hobson have forced him to
become a member of the “Parliamen-
tary Club” which he despises.
TONY ASHENDEN
White’s Appeal
The Army’s best-known conscientious
objector, William White, now serving
a 21-day sentence for disobeying mili-
tary orders, may make his next Court
appearance on December 19 almost
one year after he first applied for total
exemption, and before the same magis-
trate.
White’s solicitor, Mr. David Cooper,
has made a second official application
for his exemption, and this is set down
for hearing in Sydney’s Special Court
of Petty Sessions before Mr. C. S.
Rodgers, S.M. On December 20 last
year, Mr. Rodgers refused to grant
White total exemption, but did exempt
him from combatant duties.
White took his case unsuccessfully to
the District Court and the High Court.
On November 17 he was found guilty
of failing to report for his call-up and
six days later was carried from his
Gladesville home by State police.
He was taken to Eastern Command
Personnel Depot, Watsons Bay, where
he was charged with being absent with-
out leave and disobeying a lawful com-
mand to report to the depot. He was
fined $lO and lost pay and allowances
amounting to $24.40.
Early the next morning White con-
firmed his intention not to assist the
Army in any way. He refused to sign
for his uniforms and “carry out clerical
duties.” For disobeying these two com-
mands, he was brought before a court-
martial last week.
The court-martial, held in a small
wooden building at Victoria Barracks,
lasted 23 minutes. Military policemen
stationed at the edge of the lawn kept
spectators away. Inside, the charges
were read before Lt. Colonel D. J.
McMillen, president; Major L. E.
Kilner; and Captain P. Mazengarb.
White, who had waived the right of
professional legal counsel, was defended
by Captain A. G. Huggins. At one point
Captain Huggins asked the court for
leniency in view of White’s short time
in the Army and to give him time to
reconsider.
White jumped to his feet and inter-
jected. “Your Honor, I shall not re-

Col. E. P. T. Raine, E.D., reminded
Captain Huggins to stay within his
instructions. He also told Huggins he
draw the court’s attention to the
portion of evidence where White said
he was not disobeying out of personal
disrespect for his commanding officer,
but because the orders wepe military.
After a 20-minute adjournment, the
court-martial reconvened and sentence
was imposed.
White emerged from the rear door of
the building carrying his suitcase. He
walked to the edge of the porch,
slumped down on the step, and was
then carried to a waiting utility truck.
Onlookers cried, “Good luck, Bill,”
“We’re with you,” and “Good on ya.”
Coincidentally, the day White’s sen-
tence ends, his application for a second
hearing is scheduled. For his applica-
tion to be successful he must appear
in court, and that will depend on Army
officials, since he is now in their juris-
diction.
Meanwhile, in another conscientious
objection case last week, the Full High
Court ordered a Queensland magistrate
to rehear an application by a youth
whom he had earlier denied exemption.
The youth, Noel Edgar Collett, had
applied for registration as a conscien-
tious objector in April, 1965. His
application was refused in August by
Mr. E. N. Loane, S.M., at Nambour.
Collett and White are among the few,
if not the only, professed conscientious
objectors to make second applications
since the National Service Act was
amended in 1953. However, the cases
differ in that Collett is seeking exemp-
tion from combatant duties, White total
exemption. Collett has not yet begun
his National Service; White, if reluc-
tantly, has.
Art Critics
In Carlton, half a mile from the
headquarters of Victoria’s Vice Squad,
is the Strines art gallery, which opened
in October with an exhibition of the
work of Ron Upton.
A reviewer in a Melbourne paper
wrote of some of Upton’s drawings:
“Bones, sinews, teeth, genitals, etc.,
coalesce like biological diagrams in these
writhing black-and-white silhouettes and
change their order according to the
subjects.”
Next day at 9.45 a.m. the gallery
was visited by Melbourne’s best-known
patrons of the arts, whose attention was
most captured by a painting called
“Oops” (real title “Oops I’m Falling”).
Their cameras swung into action, and
last week the director of Strines Gal-
lery, Mr. Sweeney Ried, received a
summons from these gentlemen for ex-
hibiting an obscene article. The dedi-
cated Ron Upton was summonsed for
assisting in the exhibition of an obscene
article. They are both to appear in
Carlton Court on February 9.
It is not known how the many classes
of schoolchildren who visited the gallery
reacted to “Oops,” but the Australian
Broadcasting Commission reports that
it received no complaints when the
drawing was shown on the television
show “Watch This Space.”
The Vice Squad had been behaving
itself lately and the sudden descent on
Ron Upton’s semi-abstracts is some-
thing of a surprise. In the past they
have concentrated on simple, realistic
art. The move into the field of abstracts
and figurations may be a wholesome
sign of a broadening, deepening taste.
Oddly enough, members of Sydney’s
Vice Squad have also become art en-
thusiasts. Last week, because of “a
public complaint,” two Vice Squad
men visited Gallery A, in the Padding-
ton art belt, and subsequently charged
artist Michael Brown, of nearby Wool-
lahra, with (a) having delivered the
paintings for exhibition and (b) having
assisted the gallery to exhibit them.
Brown pleaded not guilty before Mr.
Locke, S.M.
Brown’s paintings had not had the
benefit of scrutiny by ABC cameras or
TV viewers, but some 20 of them were
neatly arranged against the walls, dock,
and bar table for the Court’s viewing.
After evidence from a psychiatrist and
an art critic, the cast was adjourned to
December 13.


SECURITY REPORT A DOSSIER ON ASIO
By SAM LIPSKI
DINNER in a Paddington terrace:
two academics, an actor, a sculp-
tress, an architect. The talk turned
to Vietnam. One of the academics
said that he felt that there would be
more interest shown by university staff
in discussions or activities connected
with Vietnam if there was less fear
of “Security opening a file on you.”
This was not the first time that 1
have heard such views expressed In
academics, but since I find it difficult
to square with what has in fact been
happening in universities I queried the
notion. If one could speak of any pre-
vailing orthodoxy in Australian univer-
sities, it would have to be Left-
Liberal. But my academic was adamant.
He was convinced that the doubts about
how Security might affect future
employment chances prevented many
academics from getting “involved.”
The suspicion of Security—the Aus-
tralian Security and Intelligence
Organisation—seems to be something
more than the normal suspicion that
would be expected of an organisation
with largely unspecified powers to inter-
fere with the rights of citizens to
privacy, free movement, and the very
rights of citizenship through naturalisa-
tion.
Whatever is the full explanation, the
Government is at least partly to blame.
The recent claims, for example, by Mr.
Francis James, of “The Anglican,”
about alleged Security dossiers on him
would not have got so much publicity
or commanded so much credence if
some parts of the public were not sus-
picious, rightly or wrongly, of the way
ASIO works a suspicion which
the Government’s indifference does
nothing to alleviate. Ever since Aus-
tralia got its first Security agency in
1917, no Government has ever shown
that it is genuinely aware of the
dilemmas and dangers inherent in the
establishment of a Security service in
any democracy.
The Liberal - CP Government's
repeated refusal to discuss the work of
ASIO in Parliament has nearly always
been accompanied by the reference to
precedent for this which Dr. Evatt and
Mr. Chifley set in 1949—with an addi-
tional emphasis on the calibre of the
men appointed to senior positions in
ASIO, their integrity, good war records,
and solid family life. The integrity of
the men rather than the law or public
and open discussion or Parliamentary
responsibility are considered to be the
citizen’s safeguards. With the excep-
tion of Mr. W. C. Wentworth and
Mr. H. B. Turner, who have both raised
the question of Appeal Tribunals for
the subjects of unfavorable Security
reports, the Government coalition has
never shown much awareness that the
necessity for ASIO poses certain in-
escapable problems.
The Labor Party on the other hand,
especially after the Petrov affair, has
Brigadier Sir Charles Spry
been in two minds about ASIO. The
most vociferous, and at times positively
anarchistic, critic of ASIO was the late
Mr. Eddie Ward, supported by Mr.
Clyde Cameron, Mr. Leslie Haylen, and
others who in effect wanted to dis-
mantle ASIO. Dr. Evatt himself was
in a special position, having been per-
sonally involved. He had been instru-
mental in setting up ASIO, but after the
Petrov affair he joined in the attacks
by Ward and others at every oppor-
tunity. Ward, especially, spoke fre-
quently of cases which purported to
show ASIO inefficiency or injustice.
According to Sir Garfield Barwick,
however, none of these charges had
ever been substantiated to him privately
although he had asked for the evidence
to be laid on his table. In all the
causes celebres which came before Par-
liament after Petrov such as the cases
of Gluckman, Russel Ward, Brenner,
Staples, and others less memorable,
Eddie Ward, assisted by Cameron and
others, was the Government’s most
severe critic. Their essentially aboli-
tionist viewpoint was rarely spelled out
but it was clear in their method of
criticism.
The more responsible critics of ASIO
within the Labor Party, who accepted
the need for ASIO to exist, have
also taken part in criticism, but on the
whole it is not their more reasoned
voices which have been heard longest
and loudest. As a party it cannot be said
that the ALP has been an effective con-
tributor to solving the dilemma which
faces all democratic governments —how
to maintain a working Security service
within the framework of responsible
government and justice for the indi-
vidual.
Yet the political parties are not the
only ones which have failed to tackle
vigorously the questions of political
liberty which the ASIO poses. Although
they have been involved directly or
indirectly in some of the most pub-
licised of the ASIO affairs in recent
years, and although in occasional letters
to the Press or articles they have ex-
pressed their doubts or fears, the
academics of Australia have not made
the one contribution to a public aware-
ness of issues that they should have.
They have not produced one serious
monograph on the work of ASIO, its
origins, its relationships with govern-
ment.
The Press has done a reasonable job
of reporting what was stated in Parlia-
ment or at other public occasions and
it has from time to time called for a
system of appeals. But mostly it has
waited for ASIO to be in the news
before contributing to the public debate.
In some cases the Press has made sure
that it would not be taken seriously by
screaming about a “gestapo.”
Part of the problem is that the
Director-General of ASIO, Sir Charles
Spry, having been director since 1950,
knows more about the Organisation
than any other man and he does not


give interviews for publication. It is
also true that it is very difficult to
get very much substantial information
on ASIO beyond that which has been
made available in Parliament or at the
Royal Commission. Nevertheless the
field is wide open for investigation,
clarification, and discussion.
A point of departure might be
November 29, 1917. It was a hot,
humid evening in Warwick, Queens-
land, just 49 years ago when William
Morris Hughes, campaigning fran-
tically for conscription, stepped from
the Sydney Express. travelling south
out of Brisbane. Before he had said
a word an egg thrown from the crowd
spattered over the platform railings.
Then a second egg broke over his
hat and knocked it off. This convinced
Hughes that he had to have his own
police force, and so for the first time
since Federation 17 years earlier Aus-
tralia was to have a Commonwealth
police agency.
A fortnight after Warwick, Hughes
announced sweeping police powers for
the Commonwealth and the first of the
Federal police began appearing in
Queensland. In his “The Australian
Commonwealth” Brian Fitzpatrick notes
that there was some resentment among
other State Premiers at the setting-up
of a Commonwealth police force—so
much so that the Acting Prime Minister
in 1918, W. A. Watt, said that if the
term “police” was objectionable or con-
fusing, the Commonwealth would con-
sider suggestions for an alternative.
So the new police force became
known as the Commonwealth Investi-
gation Branch. Its functions were rather
vague—but they did include law
enforcement and national security. It
was in fact the first national security
service—however ineffectual it turned
out to be under Hughes. Little was
heard of its security activities until the
period immediately before the outbreak
of World War II when the Lyons Gov-
ernment introduced its Refugee-
Immigration Scheme. The scheme was
to bring 15,000 refugees, mainly victims
of Nazi persecution, to Australia in the
next three years.
The budget of the CIB was increased
by a third to £16,219 in 1938-39 and
to £19,098 in 1939-40. Fitzpatrick
claimed that although the CIB increased
its surveillance of aliens at this time
and although it developed its liaison
with the State political police, the
“Special Branches,” there was still no
keeping of dossiers of non-criminals
until the war actually started. There
is some evidence, however, which sug-
gests that it might have started earlier
than the war.
In 1939, claims of espionage rings,
mainly German ones, had grown. Again
it was Hughes who had strong words
to say on Security. In July, 1939, he
announced that he would call for a
special report from the CIB about the
activities of Nazi organisations in Aus-
tralia. He also revealed that for a
number of years a careful check had
been kept of the activities of aliens in
Australia, particularly any individuals
whose movements suggested that they
might have some special mission that
might not be in the interests of the
Commonwealth. The important phrase
“Things have come to a pretty
pass when the Government estab-
lishes a security service not to
police the security of this coun-
try but to compile dossiers that
may subsequently be used to
embarrass people .”
—E. J. Harrison, Liberal Mem-
ber for Wentworth, 1948.
“The Security Service must be
operated in seorecy in order to
properly protect the community
against subversive activities .”
—Dr. H. V. Evatt, 1948.
followed: “In such cases all possible
information about their movements and
interests before they came to Australia
has been ascertained and recorded.”
In this sort of atmosphere, and with
the war underway, the security
activities of the CIB were largely
taken over by the wartime Military
Intelligence known as “MI.” As
well as its purely military activities
abroad, MI was responsible for security
within Australia and was involved in
censorship, internment, mapping of
Australia, prevention of sabotage, the
issues of passports and visas. It had
taken a great many special powers
under legislation introduced to deal
with the war in 1939.
According to Dr. Evatt, the Military
Intelligence took their powers of ad-
vice on internment to absurd and un-
just lengths. Speaking in 1956 at the
introduction of legislation covering
ASIO, Evatt claimed that in 1942
there were 7500 people under deten-
tion. Prime Minister Curtin decided
to take the jurisdiction over intern-
ment away from the military and
give it to a civil organisation. This
led to the appointment of Brigadier
W. B. Simpson, later Mr. Justice
Simpson of the ACT Supreme Court
(he died last month), as Director
General of the Commonwealth
Security Service—in fact a new organi-
sation but using some of the facilities
of both Military Intelligence and the
CIB. Shortly afterward the number
of people interned was reduced from
7500 to 500.
(Yet Evatt played a less praiseworthy
role in the “Australia First” case of
1942, which remains a blot on the civil
liberties record of Australian govern-
ments. Acting on the advice of Military
Intelligence, police arrested 16 people
in New South Wales alleged to be mem-
bers of a pro-Nazi and pro-Japanese
group the Australia First Movement.
After investigation it was later found
that half of them should not have been
detained.)
When the war ended the Government
merged the Security Service with the
Commonwealth Investigation Branch
and renamed it the Commonwealth In-
vestigation Service. This meant that
the Security and law-enforcement activi-
ties of the Commonwealth were now
together again in one organisation. But
the Military Intelligence organisation,
or some of it, was kept active in in-
ternal security, as was shown when the
next big “security” scare occurred in
Australia in March, 1947. Evatt an-
nounced that Commonwealth investi-
gators would work in liaison with Mili-
tary Intelligence and more security
officers would be appointed. This fol-
lowed the revelations of the Canadian
Royal Commission on Espionage and
the plans to establish facilities at
Woomera for rocket experiments. There
were rumors and allegations of Com-
munist espionage in Australia made by
Opposition politicians. It was not until
a year later, however, that they claimed
the United States was refusing to supply
details of atomic research to Britain,
unless it had assurances that the in-
formation would not be passed on to
Australia because of the fear of leaks
to Communists. The Chifley Govern-
ment consistently denied this. Mr.
Arthur Fadden, Acting Leader of the
Opposition, added interest to this con-
troversy when he quoted from “secret
documents.” One of these was an
alleged report of a British Cabinet meet-
ing at which Mr. Chifley had admitted


to the British Cabinet that America did
not want to pass on atomic secrets be-
cause it distrusted Australian scientists
working in the Council for Scientific
and Industrial Research the fore-
runners of the CSIRO. The veracity
of the Fadden documents, although
denied by Chifley, was never effectively
challenged.
There is no doubt that an element
of witch-hunting made itself felt in
accusations about “nests of Communist
spies” in Government departments and
especially among scientists, but this
was mixed with some solid evidence
of the Communist Party’s attempts
to sabotage the economy of Australia,
and telling arguments about the need
for security in the handling of any
atomic research information. There
were certainly some leaks in the
Department of External Affairs and
information was being passed to the
Russians. There was also the influx
into Australia of hundreds of thousands
of refugees and other immigrants from
Europe. All this probably contributed
to the Labor Government decision to
set up a separate Security service inde-
pendent of the law-enforcement Com-
monwealth police agency.
in March, 1949, Chifley announced
that he had appointed a South Aus-
tralian judge of the Supreme Court,
Mr. Justice Reed, to form and be
director of a new peacetime Security
service. What did emerge was that the
Director-General of the U.K. Security
Service, M. 1.5, Sir Percy Joseph Sillitoe,
had advised Chifley on the formation
of the new service and that basically
it was a replica of the British system.
One very important aspect of the
Security service’s apparatus in Britain,
however, was not copied in Australia.
This was the appeals tribunal to hear
appeals from civil servants threatened
on security grounds with transfer or
dismissal. This tribunal—the so-called
“Three Advisers”—had been established
by Attlee’s Labor Government in 1948
and Chifley and Evatt presumably knew
of it.
The nine months or so of ASIO under
a Labor Government passed with little
incident and with only the occasional
question in Parliament. The setting
up of ASIO was not accompanied by
any legislation —in fact this did not
come until 1956. Just like the Security
bodies before it, ASIO was not set up
by statute or after debate in Parlia-
ment but by special regulation and
administrative fiat. In ASIO’s case it
operated under a charter from the Gov-
ernment to deal with activities that
might threaten “the internal security of
Australia.”
In 1950 Colonel Charles Spry, the
director of Military Intelligence, re-
placed Justice Reed, who had been re-
leased from his legal duties to found
ASIO. With a wartime career in which
he had earned rapid promotion from
Captain in 1939 to Colonel in 1942, with
a DSO and a reputation as a brilliant
staff officer, Spry came to ASIO after
some years as head of Military Intelli-
gence and a more than casual acquaint-
ance with problems of security. Military
Intelligence had maintained some of its
security framework and, according to re-
marks in Parliament by Evatt in 1955,
“a struggle (in 1948) was going on with
military intelligence which had been
deprived of the terrific power that it
had in wartime for the internment of
civilians.” What role, if any, Spry
played in this “struggle” remains a
matter for speculation, but the organisa-
tional experience he had gained in the
Army was quickly brought to bear in
the building of ASIO.
The staff and facilities of ASIO grew
steadily from its initial budget of
£115,000 to £332,000 by 1953-54. Dur-
ing this early pre-Petrov period ASIO
was not often in the news and only an
occasional question was asked in Parlia-
Vladimir Petrov
Ivan Skripov
ment about its activities. The main
focus of attention in the early ’fifties in
matters of political security centred on
the attempts by the Menzies Govern-
ment to ban the Communist Party. The
fact that ASIO did not arouse much
public interest or concern probably
suited its early activities, especially its
counter-espionage activities.
There was one minor furore in the
early period when the Communist
“Tribune” published information from
a classified document including details
of a draft commercial treaty between
Australia and the United States. One
prominent Government spokesman de-
clared that there was a “nest of traitors”
in the public service. Some time later
in 1954 there was evidence from a Com-
monwealth police inquiry which sug-
gested that the treaty draft may have
been leaked by an ASIO “agent prove
cateur.”
The Petrov affair removed ASIO j
relative anonymity. It became clear the
the Director-General and his staff di
indeed have wide powers to act o
many matters involving nations
security without reference to anybody
including the Prime Minister (the
paid Petrov £SOOO without Menzie;
knowledge). But in answer to critic
the Commissioners rejected all sug|
gestions of improper conduct by an
officer of the service; as a counter
espionage force the service had bee :
responsible for drying up the source
from which information had previousli
been available for the MVD and it 1
agents at the Soviet Embassy; and ac
cording to the Commission the servio
officers acted with high intelligence an<
complete propriety in difficult and deli
cate circumstances. ASIO emerged fron
the Royal Commission as a very effec
tive security service.
In one of the few books ever pub
lished by the head of an intelligenci
agency, “The Craft of Intelligence’
former CIA head Allan Dulles sayi
that the Soviet Union suffered ai
“enormous setback” in Australia wher!
Petrov defected. The reputation ASICI
gained for effectiveness in the counter
espionage field was further enhanced by
the revelations of preparations foi
espionage by Ivan Skripov of thr
Soviet Embassy in 1963. Dulle:
remarks that Skripov’s cardinal
blunder was hiring a woman to helj
him build up a new undercover intelli
gence apparatus in Australia. Th(
woman was really an agent of th(
ASIO!
This, says Dulles, was “the kind ol
coup on the part of the Australians tha
the Soviets themselves have tried tc
practise so often; yet it has been rarely
practised against them largely because
in the past they did not have to rely
on strangers and outsiders.” In Aus-
tralia they came up against a “strong
and watchful Security service” and sc
could not as easily pick up Communists
or Communist sympathisers for their
work.
ACCEPTING Dulles’ assessment ol
the Petrov and Skripov affairs, the'
question again arises as to the price in!
terms of individual liberties we have 1
to pay for a “strong and watchful
Security service,” whose activities extend,
far beyond counter-espionage. An
examination of the legislation directly
affecting ASIO and some of the cases
which have brought it to public atten-
tion might help to put ASIO’s activities,
in some perspective.
There are only two pieces of legis-
lation which specifically refer to ASIO.
The first is the Australian Security!
Intelligence Organisation Act of 1956,
which gave ASIO its legislative basis'
and set down in statute what had largely)
been established practice since 1949.1
The Act provided that the head ol
ASIO should be the Director-General
and that he should be appointed by the
Governor-General. The Director-


General was given power to employ
permanent, temporary, and casual
employees. The purpose of ASIO was
defined as “protection of the Common-
wealth and the territories of the Com-
monwealth from acts of espionage,
sabotage, or subversion whether directed
from, or intended to be committed,
within the Commonwealth or not.”
There are a number of important
points worth noting. First, the term
“security” is defined, (as Chifley had
defined it) and given some limits:
it means protection against espionage,
sabotage, and subversion. Subversion
is not defined but it would be
a brave framer of the law who could
come up with a definition that would
be any better than leaving it undefined.
Nevertheless, it is ASIO’s activities
relating to “subversion” that have
caused most debate. Looked at from
the point of view of security, however,
the three areas are not separate but
linked. The Petrov Commission showed
that espionage and subversion are
closely interwoven.
Secondly, the Act makes ASIO not
only concerned with foreign powers
directing espionage, sabotage, or sub-
version against Australia, but also with
anyone using Australia as a base to
subvert or sabotage other Governments.
Judged by this part of the Act, ASIO
failed to prevent Croatian extremists
from using Australia as a preparation
and training ground for attempted
terrorist activities against the Yugoslav
Government in 1963 when they crossed
into Yugoslavia. After a trial, they were
given jail sentences for attempted
terrorism and sabotage. Since that
time, the answers to questions in Parlia-
ment have made it clear that ASIO has
kept a close watch on the Croatian
extremists and has collected informa-
tion about them. But on the available
evidence it seems that ASIO did not
know very much about the activities of
the extremists during the years 1961 to
1963, when the preparations for the
abortive sabotage were being made in
Australia.
The traditional ALP explanation that
ASIO is only concerned with Com-
munists and subversion of the extreme
left and does not worry about threats
from the extreme right does not stand
up. ASIO has been the source for
much of the Government information
about the small Nazi groups in Aus-
tralia, and the falling-off in Croatian
extremist activities is almost certainly
due to the surveillance kept on them
by the ASIO. It seems to have been
slow, however, to realise the dangers
of such groups.
The functions, as distinct from the
purpose of ASIO, are defined as fol-
lows: (a) To obtain, correlate, and
evaluate intelligence relevant to security
and, at the discretion of the Director-
General, to communicate any such
intelligence to such persons, and in such
manner, as the Director-General con-
siders to be in the interests of secui'ity;
(b) to advise Ministers, where tbe
Director-General is satisfied that it is
Max Gluckman
Russel Ward
Francis James
necessary or desirable to do so, in
respect of matters relevant to security,
in so far as those matters relate to
Departments of State administered by
them or to authorities of the Com-
monwealth established by or under Acts
administered by them; and
(c) to co-operate with such Depart-
ments of State and authorities of the
Commonwealth and, so far as is prac-
ticable, with such Departments and
authorities of the States and of other
countries as are capable of assisting the
Organisation in the performance of its
functions.
This makes it clear that ASIO is not
a police force and that it has no enforce-
ment powers. Secondly, it has no execu-
tive powers. All it can do is collect
intelligence and to report to the respon-
sible minister. It is there in an advisory
capacity. The argument that advice
from ASIO has a peculiarly compelling
quality not common to the advice from
any other Government department and
that therefore ASIO does in a special
sense have de facto executive powers is
a hard one to resist. Yet there are cases
where ASIO’s recommendations have
been rejected, especially in the
Immigration Department, where visas
and naturalisation certificates have been
granted against ASIO advice. This has
happened, however, in a minority of
cases. Generally, ASIO’s advice is
heeded.
JN introducing the legislation, Menzies
reaffirmed that the Attorney-General
was the Minister “ordinarily respon-
sible” for ASIO. But, as in the past
and as intended by Chifley, the
Director-General would have direct
access to the Prime Minister. There
is no specification in the Act of just
how the Attorney-General should ad-
minister ASIO. At the time, the Gov-
ernment defended this lack of detail
on the ground that the relationship be-
tween the Minister and ASIO would be
worked out “in exactly the same way
as the British common law was worked
out: that is, as result of experience and
common sense.” The analogy suggests
a wait longer than even some defenders
of ASIO would be prepared for.
The Public Service nature of ASIO
was also made clear. Salaries and
terms of employment for ASIO officers
were to be fixed by a committee con-
sisting of the chairman of the Public
Service Board, the Solicitor-General,
and the ASIO Director-General. Thus
conditions and* salaries were to be
broadly in line with those in the rest
of the Commonwealth Public Service.
Although not incorporated in the legis-
lation of 1956, a reply by Menzies in
1955 made it known that ASIO expen-
diture was subject to inspection by the
Auditor-General.
Why was the legislation introduced in
1956? Mr. W. McMahon, the Minister
for Primary Industry, left little doubt
as to the major reason. “The general
purpose of this Bill is to ensure that
loyal and honest servants of the Com-
monwealth who have effectively done
a job are given proper security of
tenure in their employment, and that
they shall not be lightly dismissed at
the whim of persons who feel that in the
past, by destroying the authority of
the Communists in this country, they
may have destroyed one, two, or per-
haps a few more political reputations.”
It was a candid admission that the
Government feared—or that ASIO
feared—that after the Petrov affair the
senior staff of ASIO was in danger of
dismissal should a Labor Government
come to office. This may explain why
the legislation did nothing to change
what was already established practice.
It did not aim at trying to resolve the
dilemmas of Security and civil liberties
and it did not aim to clarify administra-
tion of ASIO, because it was concerned
primarily to make ASIO senior officers
as immune from political whim as the
Public Service regulations allowed.
The second piece of legislation which
directly involves ASIO is the Tele-
phonic Communications (Interception)
Bill of 1960. It is the only explicit
grant of power to ASIO and it enables
the Attorney-General to issue a warrant
for the tapping of phones to the
Director-General of Security where he
believes that the telephone service is,
or is likely to be, used by a person
reasonably suspected of being engaged
or likely to be engaged in activities
prejudicial to security.
Professors Campbell and Whitmore,
in their recent “Freedom in Australia,”
have pointed out two dangers inherent
in the legislation. As far as its use by
ASIO is concerned, the legislation
“piles subjective discretion upon sub-

jective discretion and is completely
beyond control by the courts.” Secondly,
as the legislation stands, if, after the
request by ASIO, there has been no
actual refusal, the Director-General
himself may issue a warrant.
In 1960 Sir Garfield Barwick said
that there had been 182 intercepts
since 1950 or “about 17 a year.” Since
then there has not been any information
on how many intercepts have been made
by ASIO. A much publicised case of
telephone interception recently, which
(if the legislation was adhered to) ASIO
carried out, was the news that Aus-
tralian Security men had intercepted
messages from Communists in Mel-
bourne to demonstrators in Sydney
during the visit of President Johnson.
American correspondents travelling on
the Press jet accompanying President
Johnson were told of the efforts of Aus-
tralian Security men by White Plouse
aides.
So much for legislation—or the lack
of it. Other than the espionage
cases of Petrov and Skripov, the most
publicised cases involving ASIO have
been in three sorts of activities. The
first sort of activity has raised the
question of how far ASIO plays a role
in affecting the employment of public
servants, academics, or others in sensi-
tive positions. Secondly, there have been
activities affecting immigration and
naturalisation. Thirdly, there have
been the cases where the Government
has used ASIO officers or information
in controversial political situations.
In the first category there have not
been very many sensational public
cases involving public servants since
the legislation was passed. This
is largely because no information
is released on whether a Security
report has played a role in failure
to get a certain job, a promo-
tion, or transfer. There is no doubt
that Security reports do affect employ-
ment throughout the Commonwealth
Public Service, that all senior servants
are investigated, and that transfers and
dismissals have occurred as a result of
unfavorable Security reports. One of
the few cases made public, perhaps
one of the most embarrassing experi-
ences for ASIO, was in 1960, when a
former Communist, who had been ex-
pelled from the Party, was employed
in, of all places, the Attorney-
General’s Department as a legal officer
dealing with files marked “Most
Secret” and “Confidential.” He was
employed for ten weeks before he was
dismissed following a Security report.
Although he had been questioned be-
fore joining the Department, and
although he had been a prominent
Communist in his university days,
ASIO did not learn this part of his
background for ten weeks. No one had
asked him if he had actually belonged
to the Party. This was an isolated ex-
ample of known ASIO inefficiency,
but it was naturally seized on by
Labor Party spokesmen to ridicule
ASIO. It was answered by the Govr
ernment in familiar tones. Said Bar-
wick: “The men of ASIO are gentle-
men of great honor and integrity doing
noble work in the country quietly.”
'JJ’NDER the Act, the Director-General
is not only empowered to advise
Commonwealth Government depart-
ments —he is also able to co-operate
with State authorities. How much of
this co-operation goes on is impossible
to say.
The case of Dr. Russel Ward, who
failed to get a teaching position at
the University of New South Wales in
1956, was publicised in 1960. Academics
who had been involved in appoint-
ments at the university claimed that
“Security reports” were used in con-
sidering Dr. Ward, a former Com-
munist who had left the Party years
before, and that they were used in
other appointments. The university
denied this. But many of those who
believed that Security reports had been
used took it for granted that 'it had
been ASIO which had supplied them.
Menzies, however, went out of his way
to deny that ASIO had anything to
do with the Ward case something
that he had not done in as definite
a fashion before. He made it as clear
as possible, without actually saying so,
that the States have their own “Special
Branches” and that if a Security report
were used, it came from a “Special
Branch.” A spokesman for the N.S.W.
“Special Branch” denied the suggestion
at the time. (The Ward case was
neither the first nor the last time that
there has been confusion between ASIO
and the “Special Branches.” All State
police have these branches. ASIO men,
for instance, rarely take notes at politi-

a great moment
for all
whisky
drinkers
Connoisseurs are aware of the vital part grain plays in pro-
ducing a fine, smooth whisky. Australian barley, grown
under ideal climatic conditions, has reached such high
quality that it is now recognised internationally for its
superb whisky-producing qualities. This is important for
Australia; it is important for the entire Australian Whisky
industry. For the first time our modern distilleries, with
their highly skilled blenders and strict quality controls, are
now able to create smooth, matured whiskies of truly
unique character.
This is the era when Australian Whisky has achieved full
international recognition—so much so that it is being
sought in increasing quantities by overseas countries.
Connoisseurs are already celebrating this new era. Why
not join in and enjoy a nip or two tonight? You'll be
pleasantly surprised.
cal meetings; they do not make routine
inquiries about university student news-
papers; they do not protect politicians;
they do not dress up as vagrants in
Hyde Park before an anti-LBJ demon-
stration; they do not attend union meet-
ings. This sort of activity is police
activity, State or Commonwealth, with
the ostensible purpose of ensuring that
the laws of the State or Commonwealth
are observed. The information they
collect is available to ASIO. But ASIO
would make their own use of it and
have to take their own responsibility for
its use.)
The second sort of cause celebre has
arisen over the issue of entry permits
to Australia or Papua-New Guinea. The
two most controversial cases have been
those of Professor Max Gluckman and
Y. S. Brenner. Professor Gluckman,
Professor of Social Anthropology at
Manchester University and a visiting
Fellow at the Australian National Uni-
versity, was refused a permit to visit
Papua-New Guinea in 1960. The reason
was a Security report to the Adminis-
trator of the Territory, Brigadier Cle-
land. Cleland decided not to issue the
permit and the Minister for Territories,
Mr. Hasluck, confirmed Cleland’s
decision. Despite considerable agitation
from universities and the Press and des-
pite support for Gluckman from British
Government spokesmen, the Govern-
ment still refused to grant Gluckman a
permit or reveal any of the reasons
in the Security report which might have
explained the decision. Gluckman was
a distinguished scientist who had never
been a Communist. ASIO provided
the report to Cleland almost certainly
on information it received from British
Intelligence sources. It remains a
mystery on what the British informa-
tion could have been based, beyond
Gluckman’s criticism of Britain’s
colonial policy in Africa.
Cleland, perhaps over-concerned at
the possibility that Gluckman might be
critical of some aspects of the Terri-
tory’s administration, may well have
decided to play safe. It was a blunder
and one of the clearest examples where
a Security report was the cause of an
unjustified interference with academic
inquiry.
the Government did not have
anything in its Security report on
Gluckman which would have stood up
for very long in public became clearer
in 1961 when it was quite willing to
publicise its reasons for not allowing
an Israeli-born History lecturer at
London University, Y. S. Brenner, to
enter Australia and take up a teaching
position at Adelaide University.
Menzies and the then Immigration
Minister, Mr. A. Downer, contradicted
each other on the reasons, but it seemed
fairly clear that Brenner’s membership
of the terrorist anti-British Stern Group,
which had fought the British mandatory
power in Palestine, and his member-
ship of the Communist Party as a youth
played some part. Whatever the
reasons, what is relevant here is that
Government Ministers were prepared to
reveal parts of a Security report in
Brenner’s case in order to defend a
decision, while they tried to make a
virtue of not revealing anything in the
report in the case of Gluckman.
These cases, as well as reports of
failures to grant naturalisation because
of Security files, have strengthened
calls for a system of appeals. The
best summary of this viewpoint came
in 1960 during the Gluckman debate
in a few succinct sentences from W. C.
Wentworth himself, one of the
staunchest defenders of ASIO. “I sug-
gest that when, as the result of a
Security report, executive action is taken
in any way, the person concerned
should be told in confidence of the
proposed action before it is taken, and
he should have a right of appeal to an
established tribunal consisting of three
eminent persons not in Government
employment.
“It is not an ad hoc tribunal for any
particular case that I visualise, but a


permanently established tribunal whose
members are known in advance, and
who serve on all cases.
“I propose that on this appeal, which
would be held in camera because we do
not want the interests of an innocent
man prejudiced, he should be informed
of the nature of the charges and so
much of the evidence as can be pro-
duced without a breach of security, and
he should be given an opportunity to
show cause why the proposed action
should not be taken.
“If he be dissatisfied with this appeal
held in camera he should then have a
right of appeal before a judge of the
High Court in open court.”
Such a suggestion has the advan-
tage of supplying both a procedure for
appeals and access to the courts. It
would go beyond the British system. In
Britain the system of the “Three
Advisors” tribunal which hears appeals
from civil servants who have been
declared a Security risk by their Min-
ister sits in camera, does not allow
legal representation, and does not give
the accused a chance to hear some
evidence where it is thought that this
might endanger sources. Nor is there
recourse to the courts.
There remains the third area of
ASIO activity which has also aroused
public concern the use of ASIO
by the Government in those areas
which the Government considers to be
problems of Security, but which many
of its critics feel are more properly
matters of political dissent and opposi-
tion. The most recent example of this
sort of activity was the use of an ASIO
report in Parliament to refer to the
political attitudes of the mother of a
15-year-old boy who had refused to
stay in the cadets at his school. He dis-
agreed with the use of other cadets as
the Viet Cong enemy. Notable pre-
vious examples have been the use of
ASIO information to discredit the
“Peace” Conferences of 1959 and 1964.
'J'HERE was, however, one unusual
aspect of the Michaelis affair: for
the first time a Security document had
been referred to as such in Parliament
in the course of giving information in
reply to criticism. It was Mr. Holt’s
admission that he was quoting from
an ASIO report which gave the whole
affair a special importance. It raised
again the suspicion that the Govern-
ment does not always discriminate be-
tween political opposition to its policies
and “subversion” when it makes use of
information available to ASIO. It has
on occasions in the past relied
on ASIO to do the political
research work which its own officials
should be doing.
The point is not what information is
available to ASIO or what sort of infor-
mation it should seek. Obviously, in
the course of gathering information on
the Communist Party, ASIO is bound
to find out a good deal about the fronts
the Party uses. It is also likely, there-
fore, to find out about a good many
innocent and well-meaning if sometimes
misguided people. The point is how
the Government makes use of that
information and it is that which aroused
the greatest disquiet. ASIO is not like,
for instance, Treasury—just another
Government department which can be
used for political purposes.
If ASIO is to have the sort of public
confidence which it needs, the Govern-
ment has to be much more careful of
how it uses Security information. One
Michaelis affair can be in its own way
as damaging as any “Peace” Front.
As the growth in its budget indicates,
ASIO is expanding. The recent rise
of $500,000 to bring the budget up over
$2 million was the biggest rise in
the budget since its inception. Some
commentators have put this sudden in-
crease down to the Government’s con-
cern with the growth of protests against
Vietnam and conscription. There may
be some slight basis for this—but there
are at least some alternative explana-
tions which seem equally logical. For
one thing, the increase was needed to
pay rises in public service salaries
which apply to ASIO staff. There has
also been a growth in intelligence infor-
mation (Vietnam is a factor here)
necessitating a growth of staff, and
finally there has been a recruiting drive
in the past 18 months.
“Z suggest that the person con-
cerned should have a right of
appeal to an established tribunal
... If dissatisfied , he should
then have a right of appeal be-
fore a judge of the High Court
in open court.”
—W. C. Wentworth
Although it is a public service de-
partment, ASIO has in its organisation
features. similar to the Army and in
the same sense that one infantryman at
the front needs anything up to ten men
to back him up, a field officer for
ASIO may need a similar increase in
other staff clerks, typists, librarians.
An increase of ten such men there-
fore might mean a possible increase
of 50 staff altogether.
The ASIO recruiting drive has been
directed mainly toward the universities,
where it is trying to get good honors
graduates in histor\ and political
science to join its staff of analysts.
ASIO prefers its recruits to be under
25, and a number of wardens of resi-
dential colleges at universities have been
approached to recommend possible
candidates. Unlike the Central Intellig-
ence Agency in the United States,
which recruits more or less openly on
the campuses of American colleges (it
even has a brochure) and competes for
the best brains with private industry
and other Government services, ASIO
cannot advertise and cannot publicise
its need for graduates. Just as the
CIA finds that its main competitor is
the U.S. State Department, ASIO finds
that its main competitor is External
Affairs. To offset this it is offering 200
dollars a year more as starting salary,
which means a graduate can join ASIO
at about $3200 per annum.
One of the problems for ASIO is
that External Affairs can almost
guarantee a certain overseas posting
within a few years, while ASIO, until
recently anyhow, only had a few
officers overseas attached to Immigra-
tion to work on screening European
migrants. But recently it has expanded
some of its intelligence work into
South-East Asia, and a number of its
officers are now serving where there is
a good chance of gaining first-hand
intelligence about guerilla warfare and
political subversion.
rpHE problems of secrecy which sur-
round ASIO have their slightly
comic side. A potential recruit, for
instance, gets a letter from the Attorney-
General’s “D” Branch, and the tele-
graphic address is “Scorpion”; or The
Planning Co-ordination and Liaison
Officer’s section can be contacted by
asking for PICCOLO. On the other
hand, ASIO’s phone numbers are in
the telephone books and there are
public offices in all States. Secrecy is
not always Bondian. Members of ASIO
do not, for example, generally reveal
their place of employment. But they
are unarmed and carry identification
cards, which they will show.
The recruitment drive for gradu-
ates does not mean that these are the
only sorts of people ASIO seeks or
needs. Graduates are mainly required
to analyse intelligence and interpret the
growing bulk of intelligence informa-
tion (ASIO is sharing the world-wide
growth of intelligence - gathering
agencies), but ASIO still requires some-
one to collect the intelligence, and these
men are often former detectives.
It is a routine part of all articles
on ASIO that sooner or later the
writer has to say that very little is
known about the actual organisation
of ASIO. But a few matters seem clear
enough or might be inferred. The
Director-General is effectively more
powerful than the head of a depart-
ment and normally no security docu-
ments are passed on outside ASIO
without his perusal and consent. To
administer the organisation he has two
assistant secretaries and ASIO is div-
ided into “sections” with “section
heads.” The functions of these sections
and how they are divided is probably
not known to anybody outside ASIO,
except possibly for some ministers—
and then probably only in part.
This is how it should be. There is
little point in having an intelligence
organisation if its structure and organ-
isation are freely known. But the de-
mand for more information on ASIO’s
activities and powers can still be a
responsible one. The Government
should acknowledge that there is a real
problem of democracy. It is not enough
to rely on precedent and on the integrity
of the men involved. It should be at
least as zealous in safeguarding the
citizen’s rights as it is in safeguarding
our national security.

State Aid for Children, not Churches
Some Advice for Senator Gorton
By JOHN D. TRAILL
FOR the first time since Federation
the policy speeches of all political
parties in the recent election
recognised that Government must give
help to the independent schools. Dis-
cussion no longer centres upon the
arguments for and against “State aid”
but around the amount of “aid” and
how it should be given.
In a pluralist society these afe ques-
tions which should be resolved with the
least amount of friction. But the fact
that Catholic bishops are frequently the
spokesmen for Catholic schools—as
currently in Canberra and Goulburn —
creates the impression that “State Aid”
for Catholic schools is really a scheme
for “Aid” to the Catholic Church,
which creates uneasiness in the minds of
many non-Catholics. The Rev. B. G.
Judd, secretary of the N.S.W. Council
of Churches, said that if the
Government gave any substantial
increase in aid to the Catholic Church
it would help break down the public
school system and re-establish compet-
ing systems of private schools. The
Anglican Church would then have no
alternative but to commence its own
large independent school system. Pre-
sumably other churches would feel the
same.
It is hard to disagree with these
views. But many people might
have second thoughts generally if
such a fragmentation of education were
to result. As more “Aid” is extended
or present “Aid” is widened, public-
confusion about what is really involved
could lead to serious problems.
Already “Aid” comes in many forms.
There are Capital Grants for Science
Blocks; the payment of interest sub-
sidies; textbook allowances; Common-
wealth and State Bursaries; Student
Allowances (as in N.S.W.) subject to
a means test; and forms of assistance
for Teacher Training. But all told,
these are inadequate. They do not meet
the real cost of building Independent
Schools or represent more than a frac-
tion of the expenditure of running such
schools in view of rocketing costs. The
annual cost of educating all pupils in
N.S.W. public schools in 1960 was
$183.00 per pupil. The cost in 1966
has risen to $310.00 per pupil. Against
these figures Bishop Cullinane’s claim
for a subsidy of $2O per term for each
pupil educated in Catholic Schools is
quite moderate.
The primary purpose of Aid is to
assist the student—not a Church, nor
even a school as such. Children in the
State System do not receive a “free”
education. Taxpayers’ money is used in
effect by the State to endow, through
State Education Departments, various
schools which these children attend.
The State also does this for patients
who attend Public Hospitals, with this
difference that Health Benefits may, on
the patient’s direction, be paid directly
to the Hospital or to the Patient him-
self where he has paid the Hospital.
The State allows this endowment to be
paid not only to State Hospitals but to
approved private (and religious) hos-
pitals if the patient chooses to go to
them.
Yet the cry of “State Aid” to re-
ligious hospitals is never raised. It is
recognised that it is primarily the
patient who is being treated and helped.
Only indirectly, through his free
choice, does a religious or State hospital
benefit. Similarly (in the provision of
an educational “service” to the child), a
The Rev. B. G. Judd
properly approved independent school,
religious or otherwise, serves the same
function as an approved non-Govern-
ment hospital. Already the State pro-
vides a subsidy to each school child to
receive this service in a State school.
The question is inescapable; why not
adopt such a subsidy or endowment
system for each child whose parents
wish to educate in an approved inde-
pendent school, religious or secular?
This principle has operated for many
years in Queensland. Parents sign an
authority for allowances paid in respect
of their children at independent schools
and the schools collect the money. All
secondary students receive an allowance
from the Queensland State Government
of $36 per annum in the first three
grades, $42 per annum in the last two
years of secondary schooling, and, sub-
ject to a means test, they may receive
a further $36 to $5O per annum.
Unfortunately, the legislation intro-
duced by Mr. Menzies after the 1963
elections to provide science blocks for
independent schools established church
committees to advise on capital grants.
While the use of these committees pro-
vides a ready-made mechanism for dis-
tribution of aid to schools, they are not
appropriate for all purposes. Any sug-
gestion that Governments should pay
more and more public moneys direct to
churches (or their committees) for
schools cannot but heighten feelings
of sectional favoritism among those who
do not participate in such schemes. Mr.
Holt’s new Education Ministry might
well begin by trying to rationalise the
whole question.
Obviously the Commonwealth Gov-
ernment will have to provide more
finance eventually. “Aid” might be given
under two headings:
(a) Capital Grants or Interest Free
Loans and/or interest subsidies
could be administered by a Schools
Construction/Aid Authority.
(b) A per capita endowment/subsidy
for each child to be paid directly
each year to the Independent
School nominated by the parent
and attended by the child. A
voucher system could be used,
whereby the parent received a
voucher which could be cashed
only by the school attended by the
child on the authority of the
parent.
Such a per capita system is the only
way by which public moneys can be
properly paid from Government to tax-
payer’s child. The taxpayer’s dissatis-
factions can always be remedied at
election time. Private schools could also
charge fees above this basic allowance
and, naturally, parents, would be free to
decide as between schools and their
various fees or to choose the State
System in preference.
From such a guaranteed income based
on per capita grants plus fees, inde-
pendent schools should be able to pro-
vide their running costs and pay their
teachers. Many schools would prefer
to employ and pay their own teachers
rather than accept State-paid teachers.
Under such a scheme the Anglicans
would be able not only to establish
their own School System but could
maintain and staff it adequately.
Ultimately such a system, difficult
though it may be to start, has many
clear advantages:
1. It enables Governments to avoid
sectarian conflict between churches.
2. It avoids involvement by Govern-
ments in the internal “politics” of
churches themselves.
3. It provides the means of enabling
Independent Schools to maintain
their freedom and independence
(subject to proper supervision).
4. It clearly establishes the child as the
proper and primary object of the
Government’s (and the taxpayers’)
concern.
5. It avoids the very doubtful practice
of handing over public moneys to
churches to dispense, when such
churches or their committees are not
answerable to the taxpayers whose
money they receive.


Face of the World
Asia: Brief truces were arranged
in Vietnam for Christmas, the New
Year, and Buddhist New Year. Viet-
nam’s elected Constituent Assembly
resolved that military men should
not enter politics while serving, or
hold Government posts. A U.N. vote
on China’s admission was 57 to 46
against. In the Vietnam war, the U.S.
forces had 800 casualties for the
week, mostly along the Cambodian
border. The Australian troops found
and destroyed a Viet Cong base.
China was about to explode her fifth
atomic device, and had elevated Lin
Piao to No. 2 man. Malaysia moved
troops to Sarawak, fearing rebellion.
The Americas: President John-
son said that although the U.S.
economy was healthy he would have
to cut internal spending $4732 mil-
lion to relieve inflationary pressures.
NASA announced plans to orbit a
space workshop manned by six men
in 1968. America agreed to supply
planes and tanks to both Jordan and
Israel. In Hollywood, teenagers again
rioted against a 10 p.m. curfew.
During Thanksgiving weekend, 748
died on the roads. A ship sank on
Lake Huron, taking 29 lives. Bar-
bados became independent.
Europe: As the Aberfan disaster
inquiry began, another slide of the
mining slag heap was reported, but
was under control. Britain ended
an imports surcharge begun in
1964. In Germany, Dr. Kiesinger
was appointed to lead a coalition
government, and 3000 students
demonstrated against the rise of
neo-Nazis in politics. A Soviet
delegation of 40 arrived for a nine-
day visit to France, returning de
Gaulle’s visit to Moscow. The Luft-
waffe lost its 37th pilot in its 65th
Starfighter crash. There were further
Israeli-Arab clashes and Jordan-Syria
skirmishes. Seventy-one died in a
launch capsize in the Gulf of Oman.
Africa: The Britain-Rhodesia rift
led to a meeting between Harold
Wilson and lan Smith for last-minute
talks before Britain took the issue
to the U.N. In Malawi, Premier
Hastings Banda, who considers sanc-
tions and threats of force against
Rhodesia foolish, had been trying for
peace moves. Premier Kaunda, of
Zambia, said the British-Rhodesian
meeting was “nonsense.” In Salis-
bury, the leader of the African
Opposition in Rhodesia’s Parliament,
Josiah Gondo, predicted that the
Wilson-Smith talks would fail, and
said the exclusion of African repre-
sentatives from previous talks had
also led to their failure. Nigeria’s
military ruler, Colonel Gowon, sus-
pended the nation’s constitutional
conference indefinitely.
OVERSEAS
Indonesia’s Chinese
By JOHN BUTLER
Indonesian hatred of the Chinese
just now is reaching strident intensity.
The reason is that Indonesians badly
need somepne on whom they can
vent all the frustration they feel
at what is wrong with their country.
And the Chinese (there are about three
million in the country) are the only hate
figures left.
The Chinese are economically very
powerful, possessed not only of wealth
but of the professional and commercial
skills which have for generations made
money out of Indonesia. Their record
here is not calculated to make them
lovable. The Dutch used them cynically
as middlemen. The natives regarded
them as the ruthless agents of a harsh
Imperial power. They were and still
are —• fiercely exclusive, building their
own schools, living in their own tight
communities.
Since independence in 1949 their
official standing has depended on the
current state of Indonesia’s relations
with Peking. In 1955 an agreement be-
tween the two powers decreed that
within two years Chinese living in
Indonesia with dual nationality mqst
opt for either Chinese or Indonesian
nationality. At the moment 1,500,000
have taken out Indonesian citizenship
papers. Probably as many as 100,000
hold Chinese passports. Most of the
others are technically stateless.
Since independence, also, there has
been a series of laws aimed at curbing
Chinese economic power, but they have
usually managed to find a way round
these. For example, no Chinese is
allowed by law to register a company
and this led to the growth of “Ali-
Baba” firms: Ali for the Indonesian
whose name is on the official licence,
Baba for the Chinese who owns the
business, makes the profits, and gives
Ali his cut.
The same pattern of winking the
official eye continued more or less
easily until the attempted Communist
coup last year, and as far as big busi-
ness is concerned it still does, though
the appropriate cut to the right Ali is
probably larger than it has ever been.
But since last year’s investigations
most spectacularly in Dr. Subandrio’s
trial when it was revealed that China
had offered to provide aid to arm “a
fifth force” to be unknown to the Army
—have shown the extent of Chinese in-
volvement in the attempted coup both
from outside and within Indonesia.
There have been some ugly incidents of
mob and individual violence and the
climate of popular feeling grows con-
stantly more vengeful.
This has been particularly so in the
island of Sumatra. In riots there last
December, 160 Chinese were killed,
shops looted, property burned down.
Now every day there are stories, re-
counted with considerable gloating in
the Press, of the plight of thousands of
Chinese refugees kicked out of one
province and shunted round from make-
shift camp to camp.
Large numbers who can afford to
pay their own way to more congenial
Chinese communities like the Philip*
pines have already left by air and sea,
and many more obviously want to go.
In recent months the screws have been
tightening in a series of orders which
have been at worst cruelly repressive,
at least humiliating. Chinese schools
have been closed and Chinese teachers
expelled. The ten Chinese-language
newspapers in Djakarta have been
banned, and now there is one Govern-
ment paper in Chinese “for indoctrina-
tion of the Chinese community.”
In Jogjakarta thousands of students
pulled down the name boards outside
Chinese shops and the demonstration
was described as “proceeding in am
orderly manner.” In the town of Men-
ado the authorities, assisted by students
and mass organisations, have marked
the houses of Chinese citizens with the
initials *of the Chinese People’s Repub-
lic. It has been suggested that Chinese
“foreign nationals” should wear identi-
fying badges on their clothes.
ir pALKING to even the most liberal
Indonesians, they may go out of
their way to tell you that their doctor,
dentist, some of their best friends are
Chinese, but then they will continue
with ghoulish stories of Chinese ruth-
less cunning which recall the anti-
Semitic propaganda myths used in
Nazi Germany to present the Jew as
the traditional Shylock grinding the
native poor.
What is most alarming to the out-
sider is that the strident demands for
“a solution to the Chinese problem”
comes loudest from just those forces
in the country preoccupied with build-
ing a new Indonesia which will respect
human rights, personal freedom, social
justice, particularly, of course, the
students. But even the new leaders, the
men of liberal enlightenment, are
allowing themselves to be drawn in.
Speaking in Tokyo recently Adam
Malik, the Foreign Minister, volun-
teered that the Chinese population in
Indonesia was a headache now and
would be in the future. “What should
be our attitude?” he asked. “Should we
allow things to go by as in the past?


They receive all the facilities, all the
opportunities to exploit Indonesia.”
Up to now an official distinction has
been maintained between those Chinese
who have become Indonesian citizens
and those who remain “foreign
nationals.” But a Chinese face is a
Chinese face and no mob bent on loot-
ing and destruction has yet been known
to stop to ask for a passport.
The one question that gets well and
truly begged is whether Indonesia can
afford to do without her Chinese popu-
lation. Since the expulsion of the Dutch
businessmen in 1957, followed during
Confrontation by the British and Ameri-
cans, they are the only substantial group
with the entrepreneur skills to keep
trade moving at all. And in the present
disastrous state of the economy those
skills are needed more than ever. This
is a loaded question to put to an
Indonesian. The fact that Indonesians
are, at the moment at least, patently
incapable of dealing with the hard
facts of daily economic life, like trans-
port, distribution, marketing, is a
rankling humiliation which is yet an-
other reason for resenting the long-
privileged Chinese. What seems certain
is that the economy, currently shaking
on its all but last legs, will totter even
more dangerously if the Chinese leave
in vast numbers.
THAILAND
Increasing Terrorism
By GAVIN YOUNG
JN Thailand there are indications
that the Communist insurgency is
gradually expanding. Cases of terror
and intimidation are on the increase
and violent incidents, though on
a comparatively small scale, have re-
cently occurred in regions west of the
North-East s heartland where they were
hitherto unknown. Compared with Viet-
nam of course the whole subversive
w HaiToiT
is miniscule.
The North-East may be the geographi-
cal heart of South-East Asia, but it is
partitioned off from the richer farm-
lands of Thailand—and from Bangkok
• by a curtain of hills. And the people
on the North-East, many of whom are
of Laa origin, and who speak a local
Cl’ Th7 yS l.” ?P> r ded b y
many lhais as some kind of rather
backward outsiders.
In recent years the Thai insurgents
have been boosted by aid in arms from
Laos. They are now in common cause
with Peking. Their close links with the
Viet Cong National Liberation Front
are immeasurably assisted by the pres-
ence in North-East Thailand of thous-
ands of Vietnamese refugees from the
French Indo-China War who revere
Ho Chi Minh.
By now, many people in the North-
East will be strongly resistant to Gov-
ernment attempts to woo them. The
Government may give them electricity
and running water but can it, the peas-
ants ask, give them justice?
On a visit to this area last week, I
saw a well-ordered village that is the
end product of three vear °> hard devel _
opment work done ' b y one of the
G -r nment mobile development units -
Ihe umts concentrate on selected vil-
la&es > providing them with everything
from straight streets, house signs, sani-
tation, running water, health hints, and
crops. This village was a neat place of
well-kept houses built on stilts among
mango trees and coconut palms.
Yet, since 1963 about 100 men have
left it and joined the insurgents: forty
r _ a S T ’
° f the ™ ran off thls y ear - Argents
have shot ’ 77 three villagers
who sta y ed behmd on the outskirts.
Pollce and Government special force
patrols have been ambushed nearby and
one was w ip ed out the other day.
One can sympathise with the irrita-
tion of American military observers who
deplore the Thai Army’s inability to
react to terrorist attacks swiftly enough
to show that “crime does not pay.”
SINGAPORE
After the Student Riots
By DENNIS BLOODfORTH
AT Ngee Ann College, the workers
have been quietly effacing the
ravages of war inflicted by Singapore
“Red Guards.” They have put in new
windows, swept up the clutter of
broken bottles and chairs, repainted the
walls that were daubed with crimson.
For 25 days defiant Chinese students
barricaded themselves in this institute
of higher learning in the heart of Singa-
pore, until last week, when riot squads
protected by wicker shields smashed
their way in. They were met with a
hail of window panes, bottles, and
chairs from students fighting a stubborn
and vicious rearguard action. But,
although driven off once, the police
returned, smoking the defenders out
with teargas and detaining 131.
This was the climax to a month or
more of violent unrest, during which
four students of the University of
Singapore were banished from the Re-
public for being “closely associated
with Communist United Front activi-
ties,” 110 more were expelled from
Indonesia opens its “Legacy Box”
Nanyang University, and 67 Malay-
sians among them were forbidden to
enter this island again. Ostensibly, the
students were agitating in different in-
stitutions for different reasons.
In the University of Singapore
they were demanding the abolition of
“suitability certificates,” which involved
the political screening of all candidates
for admission, while those at Ngee Ann
College were demonstrating against
proposals to lower its academic status.
But it was not long before the Chinese
banners outside Ngee Ann College were
reading: “Crush the reactionary Fascist
government.”
Significantly, the trouble had started
in October, after the Parliamentary
group of the extreme Barisan
Sosialis (Socialist Front) had submitted
their resignations and announced that
they were going to “take their struggle
into the streets.”
About 30 trades unions, mustering
some 45,000 industrial workers, sup-
port the Barisan Sosialis, whose earlier
chiefs are all housed in various jails
under the provisions of security ordin-
ance, which permits unlimited deten-
tion without trial.
Half of Singapore’s population of
1,800,000 is now under 18 years of
age. Every year more and more young
people pour out of the schools in this
highly literate republic, demanding
good jobs. There are about 65,000 to
70,000 unemployed—the equivalent of
nearly two million jobless in Britain—
and this figure will normally increase by
at least iO,OOO (250,000 in British terms)
—every year. An energetic Govern-
ment acutely aware of its own problems
has done wonders so far. There is a
comforting accumulation of capital
here: manufacturing output rose 23 per-
cent in the 12 months ending in mid-
-1966, and trade increased by about 10
percent over the previous period.
Although she depends on her entrepot
trade, and on exporting factory pro-
ducts, Singapore has her props. These
include a brisk barter trade with Indo-
nesia, healthy-looking contracts for sup-
plying the U.S. and South Vietnamese
forces with boots and other equipment,
and above all the military presence of
the British, who spend about £5O mil-
lion here annually. But these props are
hardly designed to last, and sounder
substitutes must be found.

The “War Crimes Trial”
By SIDNEY HOOK
A FEW months ago Bertrand
Russell, the nonagenarian but
still vigorous English philosopher,
issued a call for an International
Tribunal of Justice to put on trial
“the war criminals Johnson, Rusk,
McNamara, Lodge, and their fellow
criminals.” Promptly and enthusias-
tically endorsed by Radio Hanoi and
the Communist Press throughout the
world, the indictment published by
Russell accuses the American Govern-
ment and its leaders of deliberate and
systematic resort to the use of “con-
centration camps, torture, massacre,
poison gas, and chemical warfare”
against the Vietnamese people. It
charges the United States with behav-
ing like the Nazis in Eastern Europe
and the Japanese in South-east Asia
“on a scale which is larger and with
an efficiency which is more terrible
and complete.”
The explanation of these horrible
crimes against humanity, according
to Russell, is simple. The American
leaders have done “all this to pro-
tect the interests of American cap-
italism” and further “their own
economic interests.” The people ruled
by these capitalists are kept ignorant
of the facts by a lying press; they are
unaware that they, too, are being ex-
ploited by the war criminals and in-
dustrial overlords: “. . . 66 million
Americans live at the poverty level.
The cities of America are covered
with slums. The poor carry the burden
of taxation and the fighting of colonial
and aggressive wars.”
Russell holds out hope, however,
that the rule of these “greedy and
brutal men” will be overthrown just as
soon as Americans understand the
connection between the crimes perpe-
trated in Vietnam and the poverty of
the American masses. “The Negro
struggle in Harlem and Watts the
resistance of American students” are
encouraging signs. The War Crimes
Tribunal, by providing “the most ex-
haustive portrayal of what has hap-
pened to the people of Vietnam,” will
contribute to this end.
What is curious about this document,
issued in the name of one of the most
distinguished minds of our century, is
the simplism of its thought and the
virulence of its language, matching the
crudest Communist propaganda leaflets.
The only charge absent from its litany
of crimes is that of germ warfare, the
standard Communist canard during the
Korean war that was laid to rest at the
cessation of hostilities.
Because of its extremism, some
observers have doubted that Russell
himself is author of the statement,
despite the use of the first person pro-
nouns in it. Some sentences, such as
the assertion that American capitalists
“send American soldiers to Vietnam as
company cops,” are written in an
American idiom untypical of Russell.
However, he has broadcast the sub-
stance of it on the Hanoi and Viet
Cong radios.
Obviously, Russell is not, sufficiently
free from violent bias against either side
in the Vietnam war to assess fairly the
respective guilt of the combatants.
Indeed, there is a good deal of evidence
to show that he has become almost
pathologically anti-American, not
against individual Americans, but
against the American nation —its leaders
and policies, and its people to the
extent that they support these leaders
and policies. Perhaps the most emphatic
expression of Russell's hostility to the
United States—not without its humorous
aspects—roccurred at the time of the
Cuban missile crisis. Russell had by
that time swung from a political posture
in favor of preventive atomic war to
one of nuclear disarmament. When
President Kennedy announced the dis-
covery of Soviet nuclear missiles in
Cuba, positioned to fire at the United
States, Russell taxed the President with
lying. He denied that there were such
missiles in Cuba and dismissed the
photographs as fakes. He denounced
the American heads of State as “worse
than Hitler” and as the crisis deepened,
wrote: “You are going to die because
rich Americans dislike the Government
Cubans prefer. Do not yield to ferocious
and insane murders.”
\YHEN Khrushchev finally admitted
the presence of Soviet missiles in
Cuba, Russell was not embarrassed in
the least. As a founder of Ban-the-
Bomb movement, one expected at the
very least that he would condemn
Khrushchev for smuggling nuclear
weapons into Cuba, thus precipitating
the crisis. Instead, he praised Khrush-
chev for his forbearance. Russell’s atti-
tude and sympathies were clearly ex-
pressed in the text of two telegrams.
The first was to Kennedy:
YOUR ACTION DESPERATE
THREAT TO HUMAN SURVIVAL
NO CONCEIVABLE JUSTIFICATION
CIVILISED MAN CONDEMNS IT.
WE WILL NOT HAVE MASS MUR-
DER ULTIMATUM MEANS WAR I
DO NOT SPEAK FOR POWER BUT
PLEAD FOR CIVILISED MAN END
THIS MADNESS.
The second was to Khrushchev, who
had dispatched the missiles and whose
adventurism was subsequently criticised
by his own comrades.
MAY I HUMBLY APPEAL FOR
YOUR FURTHER HELP IN LOWER-
ING THE TEMPERATURE DESPITE
THE WORSENING SITUATION
YOUR CONTINUED FORBEAR-
ANCE IS OUR GREAT HOPE WITH
MY HIGH REGARDS AND SINCERE
THANKS.
Apparently Russell’s high regard for
Khrushchev was unaffected not only
by Khrushchev’s role in the Cuban
missile crisis but by the butchery of
Bertrand Russell
the Hungarian Freedom Fighters, car-
ried out on Khrushchev’s express orders.
One might interpret Russell’s blat-
ant anti-Americanism, his shrill denun-
ciation of its foreign policy, and his
uncharacteristic servility to Khrushchev
as a kind of subconscious compensation
for his earlier espousal of a nuclear
preventive war against Communism.
But this can hardly explain the tone
and substance of his criticisms of
American domestic policies and con-
ditions in recent years. Far from rec-
ognising the great, if incomplete
strides made toward the elimination of
poverty and racial discrimination,
Russell writes of the United States as
if its minorities lived under a perpetual
reign of terror organised against them
by the Federal government, and as if
the American working class was still
suffering the throes of hunger and un-
employment. About the time the FBI
arrested and jailed John Kasper, the
white racist rabble rouser, for encour-
aging violation of a Federal court
order, Russell wrote of conditions in
America:
“Members of the FBI join even
mildly liberal organisations as spies
and report any unguarded word. Any-
body who goes so far as to sup-
port equal right for colored people, or
to say a good word for the UN is liable
to a visit by officers of the FBI and
threatened, if not with prosecution,
at least with black-listing and conse-
quent inability to earn a living. When
a sufficient state of terror has been
produced by these means, the victim
is informed there is a way out; if he
will denounce a sufficient number of
his friends, he may obtain absolution.”
These and other fantastic state-
ments, unmatched even by the worst
drivel about America broadcast by
Radio Moscow or Peking, brought
forth an indignant refutation by Nor-
man Thomas, the veteran Socialist
leader, and a more consistent oppon-
ent of war than Russell. His “Open
Letter to Bertrand Russell” on
January 7, 1957, refuting these false-

hoods left Russell unmoved. Russell’s
fury against the United States has
reached such a pitch that despite his
claims to have returned to his earlier
pacificism, he has recently appealed to
Premier Kosygin, of the Soviet Union,
to send the Soviet Air Force to com-
bat the American planes in Vietnam
• thus inviting the very global war
he professes to fear.
In his latest characterisation of the
United States, Russell speaks of the
American welfare state as if it were
an economic-military dictatorship rul-
ing over a brainwashed and poverty-
stricken population. He ignores the
fact that the standard of living of the
American working class, despite pockets
of poverty, is not only the highest in
the world but is currently the highest
in American history. He ignores the
progress the Negro, the Puerto Rican,
and other minorities have made with
the help of all three branches of the
American Government. He ignores the
fact that most principled and consistent
opponents of Communist aggression
are not the American capitalists—many
of whom wish to do business with the
Communist countries, including Com-
munist China but the organised
American Labor Movement.
One does not have to approve of
American foreign policy in Vietnam or
elsewhere to be appalled by the viru-
lence and hatred of Russell’s caricature
of America’s culture and economy.
When he shifted from the advocacy of
appeasement of Fascism in the ’3os to
resistance, he never spoke of Nazi Ger-
many in comparable terms. What ex-
plains his transition from a staunch
opponent of Communism we were
premature anti-Communists in many
battles together! to a role more
appropriate to Lord Haw-Haw than to
Lord Russell?
I am assuming, and I think it is
true, that Russell is still in possession
of his remarkable faculties —that he is
not a pitiable old man blindly signing
statements drawn up in his name by
those upon whom he has become physi-
cally and mentally dependent. One
reason for believing that he is respon-
sible for what he has written is that he
has recorded large portions of it for
Radio Flanoi for transmission to Ameri-
can servicemen in South Vietnam.
There are some who contend that
Russell’s transformation from a fana-
tical anti-Communist—prepared to des-
troy Communism almost at any cost
including nuclear war —into a fanatical
anti - anti - Communist and anti-
American, is a consequence of the
humiliations he suffered in the United
States in 1940-42. At that time he was
unjustly denied an opportunity to teach
at the City College because of his views
on sex and marriage—views that are
widely held today. Later he was rudely
and arbitrarily dismissed from his post
at the Barnes Foundation which had
been procured for him by John Dewey.
This shocking treatment left him
with a justified resentment which still
burned fiercely when I last met him in
the fall of 1953. But it does not
explain the shift of ground. For
although he was very critical of the
United States at the time, asserting
with typical exaggeration that the
United States had become a police state
under McCarthy, he was even more
critical of Communism.
The real reasons for Russell’s conver-
sion say more for his motives than his
judgment. When the Soviet Union
acquired the full panoply of nuclear
weapons, Russell became convinced that
their proliferation would in all likeli-
hood lead to a world war which would
destroy the whole of civilisation, perhaps
all human life. He was aware that the
West, particularly the United States,
had officially declared its willingness to
accept general and complete disarma-
ment provided it was universal and
multilateral, subject to strict interna-
tional control in order to prevent totali-
tarian countries, unhampered by a free
Press or a free public opinion, from
launching atomic Pearl Harbors. At
first Russell thought that the Soviet
Union would accept such controls, since
they were in everyone’s interest. But
when it became clear that the Com-
munists would not permit effective
inspection on their territory, Russell’s
views underwent a profound change.
He declared: “I am for controlled
nuclear disarmament but, If the Com-
munists cannot be induced to agree to
it, then I am for unilateral disarma-
ment even if it means the horrors of
Communist domination.” In effect, to
avoid the risks of war Russell was will-
ing to settle for peace at any price.
The foolishness of such a position is
apparent, since it can only harden Com-
munist intransigence. It offers the
premium of total victory for stubborn-
ness and unreasonableness in negotia-
tion. The logic of Russell’s new posi-
tion, the emphasis on peace at any price,
compelled him to downgrade the
importance of the values and institu-
tions of freedom in the open societies
of the West.
H E began to refer to the West and
especially the United States as the
“so-called” free societies which he
did not do when, less free than they
are now, they were struggling against
Fascism — : and to play down the evils
of Communist dictatorship in the
Soviet Union, China, and North Viet-
nam. If the United States is a dic-
tatorship of the capitalists and their
military henchmen under a formal
veneer of rhetoric about democracy, the
talk about freedom is hollow and hypo-
critical. Since the choice is between one
kind of dictatorship and another, ac-
cording to Russell’s political logic, we
may as well stay alive. Instead of re-
sisting Communist aggression by war,
which may destroy everyone, it is wiser
to yield. “The horrors of Communist
domination” will not last for ever,
Kublai Khan, after all, followed
G'engis Khan.
It is thinking of this sort which ex-
plains why Russell has declared that
West Berlin and West Germany are
not worth defending, that India was
more at fault than China after China
invaded, that the intervention of North
Vietnam into South Vietnam is not
aggression. It explains why he refuses
to speak of the deliberate murder of
tens of thousands of South Vietnamese
by Viet Cong terrorists in connection
with what he purports to be a “most
exhaustive portrayal of what has hap-
pened to the people of Vietnam,”
and why he plays up as deliberate
American atrocities the unfortunate
accidental loss of life incurred by the
efforts of American military forces to
help the South Vietnamese repel the
incursions of North Vietnam and its
partisans.
Bertrand Russell is no more a Com-
munist today than he was during the
many years he denounced its terror.

But his desperate fear of war has made
him the willing ally of the Communist
cause. Even in 1938 when he was plead-
ing that the best defence of England
and Denmark against Hitler was “their
very defenselessness,” and that in the
event of a Nazi invasion and takeover
“the consequences both to ourselves and
the world would be infinitely less ter-
rible than the consequences of war,” he
did not speak up for the Nazis or
defend their actions or pretend that
they repiesented the forces of peace
and liberation. Today, however, Rus-
sell has willingly accepted the role of
spokesman for the Communist cause in
Vietnam. Last June 11 he sent two sep-
arate messages to the Viet Cong and to
Hanoi informing them that he was
organising a War Crimes Tribunal to
bring Johnson, McNamara, and Rusk to
justice. He concluded his message with
these words:
“I extend my warm regards and
full solidarity for President Ho Chi
Minh and for the people of Vietnam.
I convey my great wish that the day
may not be far off when a united and
liberated Vietnam will celebrate its
victory in a free Saigon.”
Bertrand Russell’s place in the
history of modern philosophy is as in-
contestable as the place of Richard
Wagner in the history of music.
Neither the anti-Semitism of the latter
nor the anti-Americanism of the
former can alter that fact. But they
prove that when great men err they
err greatly.
QNE final question remains. Bertrand
Russell may be wrong in his un-
measured indictment of the position
of the United States. But this does not
establish the validity of the American
policy. What moral justification, if any,
can be offered for American interven-
tion in South Vietnam? Perhaps the
strongest defence of the official position
of the United States was actually made
a long time ago by John Stuart Mill,
the godfather of Bertrand Russell. In
an essay on “Non Intervention”
(Fraser’s Magazine, 1859), which reads
as if it were written only yesterday,
Mill wrote:
“To go to war for an idea, if the
war is aggressive not defensive, is as
criminal as to go to war for territory
or revenue; for it is as little justifiable
to force our ideas on other people
as to compel them to submit to our
will in any other respect.”
None but ideological fanatics would
dispute this. Mill then states what is
required of a foreign policy, grounded
in an intelligent morality, in situa-
tions like that of South Vietnam:
“The doctrine of non-intervention,
to be a legitimate principle of morality,
must be accepted by all governments.
The despots must consent to be bound
by it as well as the free states. Unless
they do, the profession of it by free
countries comes but to this miserable
issue, that the wrong side may help the
wrong side but the right may. not help
the right. Intervention to enforce non-
intervention is always right, always
moral, if not always prudent. Though
it may be a mistake to give freedom
(or independence S.H.)' to a
people who do not value the boon, it
cannot but be right to insist that if
they do value it, they shall not be
hindered from the pursuit of it by
foreign coercion.”
No one can reasonably question that
South Vietnam values its independence,
and that it is right for the United
States to endorse its claim. But whether
what was right was also prudent,
whether anything which is imprudent
on a large scale is also right, are ques-
tions not so readily answered. It may
have been imprudent originally to be-
come involved in South Vietnam. But
it seems even more imprudent to with-
draw from South Vietnam without
negotiating a peace. For this would
abandon the South Vietnamese to
enslavement and decimation by the
vengeful Viet Cong and thus encourage
further Communist aggression. I believe
that Adlai Stevenson spoke for the
reflective conscience of America when
he said, on the very day of his
death:
“My hope in Vietnam is that resist-
ance there ma Y establish the fact that
changes in Asia are not to be precipi-
tated by outside force. This was the
point of the Korean This is the
point of the conflict in Vietnam,
If this point gets across the sacrifices
will not have been in vain, since they
will have prevented further sacrifices,
If it does not, then since the United
States cannot be active everywhere,
prudence may dictate greater caution
in the future concerning when and
where to engage the enemies of freedom
and national independence.


ONE MORE
WEEK
Change
THE ANNOUNCEMENT by the
Johns Hopkins Hospital in Baltimore
that it was performing a limited number
of sex-change operations each month
drew a reaction from Miss Christine
Jorgensen, who, until she had a similar
operation in Copenhagen in 1952, was
an American soldier named George. “I
take my hat off to them,” said Miss
Jorgensen. It hardly seems fair to point
out to a satisfied customer that taking
her hat off as a sign of approval is
something no woman would do.
Remote
BRITISH ACTOR Robert Morley is
coming back here next year for Phillip
Productions. When Morley was last
here, in 1949, he had what still seems
to be the best answer to the question,
“What do you think of Australia?”
“It doesn’t matter what I think of it,”
he told reporters as he was leaving.
(And apparently he didn’t think much
of most of it.) “What matters is what
you think of it. You have to live here.”
It is doubtful whether he could find
a better answer when the same question
is inevitably put to him next year.
Not Good Enough
“WHO IS my neighbor?” asked the
financial editor of “The Sydney Morn-
ing Herald” recently, opening a dis-
cussion on whether Australia should let
India have wheat at concession rates,
and also, perhaps, opening up new per-
spectives for financial writers.
Christ’s idea was, of course, “my
neighbor is all mankind.” Letter-
writers have agreed that India is part
of mankind, but only if she produces
fewer Indians, more food, spends less
on armaments to fight Pakistan, and
shoots her sacred cows. It may not be
enough to produce new versions of the
Bible; perhaps the whole should be re-
written to reflect today’s attitudes and
ideas.
No Work and No Play
SYDNEY now has five fountains all
within what you might inelegantly call
spitting distance of Shakespeare Place
at the Macquarie Street end of the
Royal Botanical Gardens. However,
at the moment it seems a case of no
work and no play.
The Morshead fountain, built for
$30,000 by architects Woodward, Tar-
anto and Wallace, who won undying
admiration for their El Alamein foun-
tain at Kings Cross, was opened
officially last week. But the architects,
who could not have a “dry run” before
handing their work over, are still
smoothing out difficulties.
The more florid Phillip fountain
nearby was put out of commission when
the Cahill expressway was built under-
neath. Afterwards, the Sydney Water
Board stipulated that fountains must
reuse water. The Gardens authorities
have now installed pumping machinery
and hope to have the Phillip working
before Christmas.
The small fountain at the entrance
to the Gardens in Macquarie Street is
under the control of the Crippled
Children’s Association. At present, it is
out of commission while adjustments are
made in its filtering material. The
Pioneers’ Garden fountain went dry
during Sydney’s drought but should
be playing again very soon. The fifth
fountain, in front of the State Offices,
and part of the building’s air-condition-
(ing system, will be functioning when
the building is.
Sweet Charity
IT IS A SAD FACT THAT, like all
other businesses, the business of raising
money for charity either has to get with
it or go under. The slicker fund-raising
organisations would horrify their sup-
porters if it could be established just
what proportion of the given dollar went
to the administration that made it so
slick.
Against this outlook toward charities
in general, Western Australia, where
this year the Miss Australia finals were
judged, has been left with an unquiet
feeling over the recent quest, run in the
West by one of the best-publicised and
consequently most widely supported
charities of them all the Spastic
Welfare Association. This group’s fund-
raising runs to life-sized statuettes of a
girl with callipers on her legs and hold-
ing a collection box in a number of
stores, and the highly efficient door-to-
door business of getting collection boxes
placed handily around the kitchens of
most suburban homes.
But the most spectacular effort is the
quest, probably the most lavishly pro-
duced junket of the year, rivalling Royal
tours for sheer glitter. Of course, the
critics can be easily answered by the
undisputed fact that most of the lavish-
ness is the result of donations from
commercial enterprises, who want
their generosity to get as much back
in publicity as it can.
Still, for people helping the charity
it grates to see each entrant chauffeur-
driven and alone in one of a string of
cars on long country tours. To make
it even more ridiculous, the girls them-
selves complained of being bored. For
the organisation’s helpers, many of them
parents of children with disabling and
disfiguring cerebral palsy, the emphasis
of the quest on physical perfection must
seem slightly off-key.
This year’s quest ended on a couple
of sour notes: the previous year’s win-
ner, Sue Gallie, of New South Wales,
was asked to leave the hotel where she
was staying as part of the ‘quest en-
tourage because the organisers said she
might take the spotlight off her succes-
sor, Margaret Rohan. She was annoyed
indeed about this, and was allowed to
stay in Perth (where her parents were
holidaying) only after repeated letters
to the organisers. She was glad to be
rid of the title, she said, rating the
past year among the least happy of her
life; this may be simply exhaustion, but
it did nothing to boost the quest.
The occupational disease of being
over-organised became too tiresome to
be ignored after a while. Girls, chosen,

Nothing on the House
ON THE most epic pub crawl ever
recorded in Australia, University of
N.S.W. Professor of Architecture, J. M.
Freeland, author of “The Australian
Pub,” was never given a free beer.
“They always took my money,” he
said. They took it from Cairns in
North Queensland to Geraldton in
Western Australia and down to Tas-
mania. But they didn’t do too well out
of the professor, who describes himself
as a “one-beer-a-week man.” His in-
terest was purely architectural.
He regards the Australian hotel as
extremely interesting, feels that it
expresses the very essence of our his-
tory. It reflects the society and the
times irl which it was built with a
straightforward honesty that many more
pretentious buildings lack.
“Our pubs are the quintessence of
our architectural heritage, a distilla-
tion of its history in a most unique
way.”
His interest was originally just a
hobby pursued on holidays, but when
his publishers, Melbourne University
Press, who handled his first book, “Mel-
bourne Churches,” found out that he
was a pub-fancier, they suggested he
write another book.
Four years and hundreds of hotels
later, having travelled so much that
it seems unlikely he will be recom-
pensed by the book, Professor Freeland
handed over the manuscript. Only a
very few of the hotels mentioned in
the book proved too far away for a
visit. He managed to fit his pub crawl-
ing into vacations from the university
and his writing into every available
moment. “It was quite uneventful re-
search. Nothing exciting happened.”
Though ghosts were promised by
many publicans, who like to have a
little romance about, Professor Freeland
found them missing. He is still hearing
folk lore. One hotel is reputed to have
a trapdoor at the bar. The publican on
his side had a lever. In the bad old
days the drunks might suddenly dis-
appear into a cellar where they could
sober up before climbing back out for
another drink to help them' forget.
However, the professor has not yet had
time to check this out.
Tasmanian bom, Professor Freeland
was educated at Melbourne University
when he returned from service with the
RAAF. He was a fighter pilot and was
awarded a DFC, though he claims he
doesn’t quite know why. It came to
him as an immediate award while he
was flying Hurricanes against tanks.
During the war he was able to get
almost round the world. He was in
Europe, England, and the United
States.
After eight years away from school,
Freeland found it hard to go back to
studying. Vocational guidance people
i . j i .. . . v tt
advised architecture or journalism. He
~.. J , , ,
took the university course, though he
was already married and had one child
and he knew it would be a struggle
His wife encouraged him and helped
keep the wolf from the door by dress-
making. She sat. up until the small
hours sewing, while he studied.
The battle paid off in the end and he
gained his degree. In 1961 he became
a full professor. Now, with two books
published and a third contemplated, he
can feel he has combined his two
potentials, journalism and architecture,
He likes architecture that is an
honest reflection of the conditions that
give it birth and feels that Sydney has
had some very fine buildings erected
in the past five years, including the
Water Board building, the IBM build-
,and the Australia Square tower.
?l,e lat ' er > to Professor Free-
! a "d shows a wonderful advancement,
introducing as it does modern con-
.&, . t •
struction and structural techniques,
which ive it t significance . H ow .
ever h a feels the least said about the
new Wentworth Hotel the better.
Describing himself as a placid man
with no pet grievances, he enjoys
music and the theatre and has made a
lifelong study of comparative religions.
“I am not a churchgoing man, but
religion is very important to me,” he
said. “I think the most important thing
in life.”
The Letters of Trevor Gooseboot
(Intercepted by Will Rushton)
Dear Mother,
It seems that I must return to the Land of Hope and Glory at once. That
Harold Holt should be swept into power on a wave of apathy when he should
be forcibly dunked into a deep pool of diluted, lukewarm Coca-Cola and pelted
with stale hamburgers, is depressing enough but there are other factors. It all
happened to me very suddenly last week. I had just emerged from a cool,
green-tiled hotel into the hard, hot sun of a Sydney day, and was thinking
lightly of cricket and jacarandas blooming and other summery offerings, when
a deeply tanned face, white bearded and capped in scarlet was pressed into my
own. “Ho! Ho! Ho! Merry Christmas, mate!” vouchsafed the sweating face
of an Antipodean St. Nicholas. “Rubbish!” I said, “Push off with your festive
greetings.” But it was so. Christmas is coming, and the Goose is perspiring
freely. It isn’t natural, Mother. Christmas without holly and Yuletide logs
and heavy drizzle is not Christmas, and I am a sentimentalist. The child
Jesus (Happy Birthday, God!) may or may not have been born in a steaming
heatwave, but I cannot envisage myself tucking into the plum pudding on
Bondi Beach. So I must away.
Anyway, Australia has voted for Holt and the American Alliance for three
years at least, though I think the sentence could be quashed on the grounds of
insanity, and I must back to Old Dart. How amazing to think, such is the
wonder of Modern Travel, that I shall be seeing you once more in 36 hours or
so. I shall be flying QANTAS.
Yours ever,
Trevor.
P.S. It must also be confessed that I have been deported.


Dr. Pockley in Orbit
By APRIL HERSEY
THE ABC has just established a
special unit for the purpose of
bringing science to the masses
and heading it will be Dr. Peter
Pockley, 31, surely one of the liveliest
doctors of scientific philosophy ever to
emerge from Balliol College, Oxford.
In a cluttered room filled with tapes,
data, scientific reports, and “millions
of ideas for programs”—perched like
an angular bird in his nest four floors
above William Street, Sydney, Pockley
fairly hums with nervous energy. In
the past three months he has not paused
for more than five days in one place,
has travelled 45,000 miles while he
broke new ground preparing the first
program to be bounced from a satellite
between England and Australia, and
during this same time finished and
corrected the proofs for a textbook on
Physical Chemistry which will become
standard for British schools when it
appears in two weeks’ time. He also
tutors Chemistry at Sydney University,
where he lives at St. Paul’s College, “to
keep in touch.”
“The satellite thing was not strictly
a scientific program,” he said. “I be-
came involved through my knowledge of
the European system. It may have
appeared all rather casual—we hope
that it did—but it was all timed down
to the last split second and everything
was calculated, even the possibility that
there would be a time lag between the
sound and the picture—though this
didn’t happen.”
Other television programs have in-
cluded two on Astronomy which took
six months to prepare and 50 minutes
each to show. Pockley was determined
not to film a staid scientific monologue,
so he spent a week in each centre, then
used outside film units in a “now it's
happening” approach.
He intends to use this technique
wherever possible. “Science is im-
mensely exciting, not just to scientists,
but to any educated layman,” he said.
“I feel that the really interesting de-
velopments would make competitive'
viewing against any type of program. - ’
He joined the ABC in 1964 for both
radio and television while still in Eng-
land and was immediately sent off to be
Australia’s representative at a Scien-
tific Film festival at Athens. Here he
found that Australia was being sabo-
taged and her films were missing. He
discovered them hidden in a back room
and produced them in time to take their
turn, much to the chagrin of those
who wanted them lost.
“I knew nothing about scientific
films, television, or radio,” he recalls.
“I had everything to learn. I had to
produce my first radio talk in a matter
of minutes. I was bluffing most of the
way in those early days but as I
was the first scientist to be employed,
I was making my own rules anyway.”
A sort of press-relations man be-
tween the laboratories and the com-
mon man, Dr. Pockley has one of
those scholastic records that has been
brilliant from kindergarten. He con-
sistently topped his class in everything,
won a scholarship to Geelong Grammar,
where he matriculated with first-class
honors in English as well as Science.
In fact, it was a toss-up whether he
would take Arts or Science at Mel-
bourne University, but he decided on
Science topping his year.
In case he had made a mistake, he
decided to catch up on the other cul-
ture by taking a teaching course, and
he gained a Diploma of Education
with first-class honors again. He taught
for two years at Melbourne Grammar,
then began to think about post-gradu-
ate study. Again he was undecided
between Science and the Arts, but
Dr. Peter Pockley
finally won an Australia-wide Shell
scholarship which took him to Oxford
to study Science.
He spent three years there, “golden
days, quite halcyon, really,” where he
not only conducted intense geological
research, but pioneered the use of a
computer in checking the age of rocks.
He was elected President of the Junior
Common Room, a busy job which
included meeting the Queen and other
visiting dignitaries. He also rowed in
the championship eight at Henley and
gained his doctorate, though he liter-
ally finished his thesis on his way to
hospital for an operation.
Afterwards, in a plaster cast from
neck to pelvis, he went forth to teach
again, this time at Wellington College
in Berkshire.
He taught for two years, and then
decided it was time to take another
look at Australia. “After five years you
have reached a time when you either
throw in your lot with the English, or
come back.”
The prospects in England were very
inviting, but he decided to spend the
long English summer holidays having
a look at the world. Having gone right
through his education on scholarships
he had no money, but his headmaster
managed to get him sponsored on a
scientific world tour, which he com-
pleted in sixty days.
He eventually reached Australia, but
while looking at the Mt. Isa mine he
was hit by a great piece of copper ore
and rushed off to hospital again for
agonising operations to his crushed
hand and thumb. When recuperating
he called at the ABC with a letter
of introduction, as just another leg
on his tour. They discussed educational
radio and television with him.
The Commission kept in touch with
him and he began to realise he was
being considered for some kind of job.
But he was back in England again
after having driven through Turkey,
been threatened with a pistol in Bul-
garia, and almost knifed in Jordan be-
fore he saw the ABC advertisement for
a scientist. He decided to apply and
was appointed in September, 1964.
After the Athens film festival he re-
turned to Australia, learning as much as
he could about television and radio in
England, Canada, and the United
States on the way.
“I am a chemist,” he says. “Sud-
denly I realised I had to be pretty
up-to-date with everything that was hap-
pening in science in every field.”
He has made a pretty good fist of
it. His Sunday radio program “In-
sight” has regularly produced front-
page news. His television programs
have been repeated and also have sold
well overseas.
Now that his labors have been recog-
nised and he is to be detached from
the Talks Department and made the
head of his own unit with an executive
producer and a radio producer as well
as other staff, he intends to increase his
output.
He wants to touch on any scientific
subject that will interest people, in-
cluding medicine, psychology, noise
abatement, air pollution, and such far-
out themes as science fiction. Recently
his radio program dissected and psycho-
analysed Sherlock Holmes, and as a
Christmas offering he plans Zany
Science, a send-up of the dedicated
taking themselves too seriously.
But there will be plenty of meat for
the intellectuals. “Any theme must be
accurate, and the serious things must
have significance. Research if it is in-
cluded must have international stan-
dard and quality. We won’t show
minor things just because they are
Australian.”
One of Pockley’s first assignments in
1967 will be televising the Australian
and New Zealand Association of Ad-
vancement of Science Congress in Mel-
bourne in January.

AROUND MELBOURNE
The Ways of a Greyfriars Man
ACTUALLY there was a time
when I thought the inspiration
for several of our Great Public
Schools was derived entirely from
“The Magnet.” They had the same
fagging system, the same worship of
sport, the same supreme majesty of
the senior prefects.
Greyfriars and “The Magnet” was
a perfect product of Edwardian
England. Everything was so very
comfortable and secure. Aristocrats
like the Rt. Hon. the Earl of Maule-
verer were placid, easy-going,
terribly languid, but one always knew
they were decent, plucky, and British
to the end in a scrape.
All foreigners were slightly odd.
Frenchmen wore funny pointed
beards and were called “froggies,”
Italians were “dagoes,” Chinese
wore pigtails, had funny names, and,
like Wun Lung in the Remove,
weren’t entirely trustworthy. Ameri-
cans, really, were pretty vulgar. For
example, there was Fisher T. Fish,
who thought only about amassing
money, just like his cigar-smoking
millionaire father, Hiram, from the
Yewnited States. Most foreigners
were a bit shady, but Indians like
HRH the Nabob of Bhanipur,
Hurree Jamset Ram Singh, were
thoroughly decent chaps really —■
they had to be because of their
aristocratic upbringing—but the way
they talked was vastly amusing.
However, one learned that at
Greyfriars fair play was paramount,
any form of scholastic brilliance was
something to treat with suspicion,
even ridicule, and things to be ad-
mired were a title, sport, skill on the
playing field. Frankly it is surpris-
ing that Frank Richards, the creator,
who has been dead these five years,
Greyfriars, and Billy Bunter haven’t
been well and truly forgotten. But
the truth is they are causing great
happiness amongst the publishers.
Cassell and Co. have 30 Billy Bunter
titles on sale in hard covers for $1.60
a copy. Cassells in Melbourne report
that there’s one old gentleman w'ho
buys every one that comes on the
market. When he buys a book he
sends cash for his next Billy Bunter
so that he won’t miss out.
All this has no appeal whatsoever
to the 14-year-old of 1966. The
appeal is to the over 40-year-old who
never quite forgave the Establish-
ment for the death of his comic dur-
ing the Second World War. Now
old Greyfriars material sells very
well indeed. This time last year we
saw the publication of “Greyfriars
School —a Prospectus,” by J. S.
Butcher, Esq., compiled from the
records of the late Frank Richards.
This was a fantastic publication and
from it the devotee was able to learn
much more about Greyfriars and all
its pupils than ever he could about
Geelong Grammar and Timbertop.
Even though the very slim vol-
ume sold for $4.80 it went in a hurry
and smartly became a collector’s
item. Next we had the publication
of a facsimile of the first issue of
“The Magnet” dating back to 1908.
This too went in a hurry. This week
as I was passing a book shop I was
fascinated to see “Billy Bunter’s
Holiday Annual, 1967.” It had the
traditional yellow cover and there
was William George Bunter himself
with a spread, feeding himself on
two buns at once.
The foreword from W.G.B. him-
self read: “Dear readers, it is with
pride and plessure that I put before
you a speshul issew of my Holiday
Annual. Chums from all over the
beastly unvurs have been asking to
read again some of the good old
fun at Greyfriars. Mind you, most
of the chaps at school are beasts to
me and don’t apreshiate my honest,
generus karakter . . .”
Ah, yes, this was the first issue
of the Holiday Annual since 1941.
Except, in those days it was always
called “The Greyfriars Holiday
Annual.” Billy Bunter, who was
barely mentioned back in 1908, now
completely dominated the Famous
Five, thoroughly decent chaps like
Harry Wharton, Bob Cherry, and
Frank Nugent.
Psychologically, Bunter, like one
“A best seller, and they didn’t
even have to ban it.”
of A 1 Capp’s “Kygmies,” is a much
more satisfying type. He is entirely
incompetent at everything, he is
stupid, he is a sneak, a liar, a glut-
ton, lazy. One can look down upon
him with great happiness.
From the two recent volumes one
can learn essential details, all
teachers, all boys, even the coat of
arms. Greyfriars “is in unspoilt
country surroundings, within easy
reach of the coast of Kent and in
close proximity to the River Sark.”
It is, of course, one of the Great
Public Schools and it was founded
by the Grey Friars in 1551. We learn
that in 1564 Queen Elizabeth I
visited the school. “The headmaster
had the honor of entertaining Her
Majesty, and ‘Good Queen Bess’ was
acclaimed by the scholars. In 1643,
at about the time of the Battle of
Newbury, the school was involved
in a minor clash with Parliamen-
tarian troops. The sympathies of the
head and the scholars were mainly
with King Charles I.”
The tuck shop was established
under the reign of Queen Anne and
is now under the management of
Mrs. Jessie Mimble. The school
telephone number is Courtfield IG6.
The boys rise in the summer at 6.30,
go to chapel at 7.15 a.m., and have
breakfast at 7.45 a.m.
“Fagging” has been a custom at
Greyfriars for many years. It is
confined to boys of the third and
second forms. Their duties consist of
tidying studies, preparing tea, run-
ning errands and such.
The prospectus is full of such de-
tailed information, floor plans, the
study room of every boy in the
school, and, for heaven’s sake, we
even get the school song, “The Jolly
Old Friar,” set to music. The
chorus goes:
Good old Greyfriars, second to
none
Past and present and forty years
on:
Never in the cart, ever in the
van
For that is the way of the Grey-
friars man.
There are about 300 boys at the
school and 37 are listed in the
Lower Fourth, the Remove, and we
are happily furnished with height,
ages, and weight of everyone in the
class. William George Bunter is 15
years one month, 4ft. 9in., 14st.
1241 b. The only thing we do not
learn is any information on school
fees. But then, one feels to even
ask would be bad form. If you
need to know the price, then obvi-
ously you can’t afford to send your
son there.

What is an Oriental rug
—do you really know?
1. AN ORIENTAL RUG IS A
NATURAL CARPET entirely
hand-made of handspun wool, gener-
ally vegetable-dyed to mellow and
improve with use, possibly the only
folk art still produced under the
original conditions available today.
2. AN ORIENTAL RUG IS AN
ORIGINAL CARPET—each piece
is unique, individual, distinctive, re-
flecting your personality.
3. AN ORIENTAL RUG IS A
UNIQUE CARPET an ancient
art form that has survived the cen-
turies and in its variety includes
both the rich, elegant timeless pro-
ducts of the Persian master crafts-
men in cities like Keshan, Isfahan,
Tabriz and the striking, colourful
or boldly simple rugs woven by
hundreds of nomadic tribes who
wander the great plains and deserts
of Western Asia.
4. AN ORIENTAL RUG IS AN IN-
CREASING ASSET—the value and
beauty increase with age as colours
mellow and use adds a patina
(being hand-knotted it can withstand
30-80 years wear).
DENIS CRONEEN'S GUARANTEE! We
undertake to buy back in ten years at pur-
chase price the fine Persion rugs we sell you
now we know our rugs are assets!

ON THE MARGIN
And Quiet Flows the Milk
Larry takes a look at
THE BRITISH
DOWN-UNDER
ONE of the most valuable adult
education services in this country
is provided by breakfast cereal
packets. With their aid most of us can
■'pend a few instructive minutes each
morning studying the history of aero-
nautics or the folkways of Red
Indians. A new field has been opened
up lately by the Weet-Flakes people
with their series of cards on National
Costumes of the World.
Of special interest is the card depict-
ing some Cossacks in their Sunday best.
In the past the Cossacks have suffered
from unfavorable publicity. They were
reputed in Tsarist days to occupy them-
selves largely in whacking Jews with
knouts. Hence it is an agreeable sur-
prise to find that the Weet-Flakes
(’ossacks are a happy, smiling group,
and include pretty girl Cossacks. There
is not a knout in sight.
After a moment’s reflection this card
struck me as not only charming but
puzzling. Relations between the West
and the Soviet Union, while improved,
are still somewhat distant and wary. It
seemed curious that a solid private
enterprise like Weet-Flakes should go
out of its way to make Cossacks lovable.
T put an undercover man to work,
charging him to find out, if possible, the
background to the card. He learned
that there was indeed a story behind it.
It began when Weet-Flakes wrote to
the Russian Government, asking per-
mission to send a photographer to take
pictures of Cossacks in national costume.
The request was referred to Vassily
Multibunko, head of the Bureau of
Agitation and Propaganda (Agitprop).
After reading the letter, shrewd, hard-
eyed Multibunko rapped out a ques-
tion: “What are Weet-Flakes?”
A week lapsed before an answer
came through in cypher. It did not
allay Multibunko’s suspicions.
“Why should Weet-Flakes want to dis-
tribute pictures of Cossacks?” he said.
“No doubt they are aiming at anti-
Soviet propaganda. Moreover, their
photographer will try to take pictures
of military installations. Tell Weet-
Flakes they cannot send a photographer,
but if they care to send one of their
executives we shall be willing to discuss
the project. I want to find out what
their game is.”
So it came about that Norman
Threepwood, 35, Weet-Flakes vice-
president in Charge of Cards and Packet
Design, found himself making a rush
trip to Moscow.
When he went alone to have dinner,
he was delighted to find a dark, beau-
tiful girl sharing his table. Her name
was Natasha, and she invited him to
her room afterwards.
After pouring the drinks, Natasha
sat next to Threepwood on the sofa.
Her perfume was disturbing as she
leaned toward him and said softly:
“Tell me about Weed-Flakes.”
Threepwood replied: “It is a crisp,
crunchy, vitamin-packed food that
brings you all the tangy goodness of
freshly toasted wheat.”
The vodka was coursing through
Threepwood’s arteries. Soon Natasha
had a soft arm behind his neck.
Weed-Flakes men are so strong,
so masterful ...” she whispered.
Mad thoughts were crowding into
Threepwood’s mind. The bed was only
a few feet away. He did not know
that the ceiling above it concealed a
television camera, linked by closed
circuit to the office of Vassily Multi-
bunko.
But suddenly Threepwood leaped to
his feet. The years of training in the
Weet-Flakes organisation did not count
for nothing. He could not let the firm
down.
“I’m —I’m sorry,” he stammered. “I
have to go—” And he rushed from the
room.
A week later he was granted an
appointment to see Vassily Multibunko.
The Agitprop chief was glancing
through the file on him. Results were


disappointingly negative. A pamphlet
entitled “Snap, Crackle, Pop,” found
in Threepgood’s luggage, had been
cleared as ideologically neutral.
“Mr. Threepwood,” he said, “I regret
that our policy does not permit you to
photograph Cossacks. But as a mark
of goodwill towards Weet-Flakes we are
prepared to make available a photo-
graph taken by one of our State photo-
graphers. The Cossacks are a gay,
laughing people, and this happy study
shows them at their finest ...”
Back at head office Norman Threep-
wood tossed the photograph on the
chairman’s table. “Sorry, boss,” he
said. “But it’s the best we can do.”
ROSS CAMPBELL
New Mother Hubbard
WITH 31b. of suet and a pair of
trotters between us and starva-
tion, it was a matter of some
relief when Jerry from Munchen
brought replacements for our freezer.
Unlike Harold from Hamburg, who
delivered it first time round, he had
little to say on the subject. Since he
pronounced our name Genius it was
probably just as well.
Mrs. Katharine Pirie, Amana’s
Supervisor Food Consultant (All
States), however, had lots. Her first
time, round six months ago, occurred
in the dead of night, when she arrived
with a gentleman’s briefcase contain-
ing, among other things, a gruesome
picture of what the average family
of four eats in a year. The sight of this,
plus the recent bank statement burning
a hole in my husband’s hip-pocket, tip-
ped the balance in favor of eating the
freezer plan way and, to this day, when
friends ask whether the scheme works
(meaning is it a flop, they hope) we
chant: “What we once spent $2O a
week on, we now spend $l4 and that
includes buying the freezer.”
Like all facts of this nature, once
acquired it was very difficult to let
go, but Mrs. Pirie, who said please
call her Kathy Pirie because her firm
wants to build her up as a homely,
warm body, assured me her figures
were right. This aspect of freezer
ownership, although no doubt interest-
ing to the bank manager, no longer
has quite the same appeal for me. What
is appealing is having your own super-
market in the kitchen open 24 hours
a day and no queuing when you get
there.
On her second time round, Mrs.
Pirie produced the interesting statistic
percent of Americans shop the
freezer-plan way. They buy their meat
bulk, this being the commodity on
which most savin § is made > and s . tow
d awa y either by the carcass or cut into
joints.
Since the average Australian adult
eats three to four pounds of meat per
week, it is only a matter of time (Mrs.
Pirie reckons five years) before they,
too, deep-freeze en masse. It seems ap-
propriate, therefore, to pass on some
of our deep-freeze experiences which,
for the purpose of this informative
article, will be kept on a serious level,
While there is no apparent danger
of shutting oneself or one’s child or
family pet (not counting, I would say,
those of the mice genre) into it—the
shelfing arrangement prohibits this
there is some opportunity for injury
via the dropping of a frozen three-
pound joint on one’s foot. But this I
have come to regard as an operational
hazard. Children, however, are fas-
cinated by freezers, or it could be their
perversity in touching the one thing
they are told not to. One nipped down
to the basement and left his mother’s
freezer door open all night. A key is
provided and, so long as the child does
not lose this, it makes sense to keep
it locked.
It is essential to keep a cool head
and not eat the best things first, other-
wise you are left with a surplus of not-
so-goodies. To be stranded with, say,
shank for an elegant dinner party at
which one hopes to impress visiting
royalty would be extremely disturbing.
On the other hand if, like me, you
cannot bring yourself to examine the
packet of brains, let alone cook them,
it is quite a useful gift for someone who
loves them.
It is clearly an advantage to indulge
in which Mrs. Pirie calls bulk-cooking,
in that fuel expenditure is the same
whether baking one or a dozen steak-
and-kidney pies. Labor and time are
not, so I am not in favor. Amana also
provides special paper and sticky tape
for freezing your own things i.e.,
vegetables and fruit in season which,
again, is an obvious economical move.
Failing this, we have discovered the
paper and tape makes splendid wrap-
ping for parcels.
we became freezer-owners, the
first reaction of friends was dis-
belief due, no doubt, to the fact that the
English are slow starters in modern
living, while Australians with showers
and two-car families are not. One by
one they stared goggle-eyed at our four
rTionths’ supply of meat, vegetables, fruit
juice, butter, cakes, ice-cream, and all
the rest. We have now learnt to dispose
of what they consider tricky questions
regarding the wisdom of our invest-
ment, such as what happens if there is
a power strike and the food goes bad,
the answer being it takes 14 hours to
thaw and if it went off then, by the
grace of Amana, it is restocked free of
charge.
Anyway, apart from the technical
side of our freezer and all the labor-
saving it has brought to our household,
there is the knowledge that Mrs. Pirie
is always by her telephone should we
get stuck with our goulash.
In fact, if it hadn’t been for her we
would never have known that this year’s
in-dish is Osso Buco. A great improve-
ment on last year’s, which led one
woman to remark how much her hus-
band enjoyed her standing rump.

WILDLIFE
Gone But Not Forgotten
Bv ALEC CHISHOLM
IN recent years,
specimens of
a number of
animals which
had been written
off as extinct
have been found
in various States.
At the moment,
Victoria is lead r
ing in the restora-
tion contest.
For many years Melbourne naturalists
had been ambitious to rediscover one
or more examples of Leadbeater’s
possum, a pretty little animal of which
very few specimens had been seen since
the original discovery of the species in
Gippsland a century ago, and which
appeared to have slipped into oblivion.
All searches and many expeditions
operated in rough country over the
years —faded into blanks.
Yet, to general astonishment, quite a
sturdy little colony of the “lost”
possum was chanced upon, in 1961, only
a short distance to the north-east of
Melbourne, and since then the species
has been devotedly studied. But that
discovery paled beside a more recent
development a discovery made not
through searhcing, but in fortuitous
fashion and one involving an animal
never previously seen in life, at least by
white men. The central figure this time,
again a natty little possum, belonged to
a species hitherto known only from
bones found in cave-deposits and known
only by a scientific name, Burramys
parvues.
Here it appears seemly to mention
that I discussed both the Leadbeater
and Burramys possums in THE
BULLETIN over five years ago and
there threw out a pointer, maybe
a trifle dubiously, on what has now
come to pass. In that article I re-
marked that Burramys, when “chris-
tened” about 70 years ago from fos-
silised bones found in Wombeyan Caves,
N.S.W., had been considered to have
vanished the scene in the distant past
(perhaps 10,000 years back), but re-
mains recently found in cave-deposits
left by owls in East Gippsland indicated
that the animal had, in fact, lived on
into a much later period and had been
a contemporary of its Leadbeater rela-
tive. And, making a mild sortie into
soothsaying, I ended the article thus:
“Is there, one wonders, any chance of
either or both of these animals turning
up alive in some quiet spot?”
Obligingly now, both have done jusr
that. But, whereas the lost Leadbeater
has reappeared in small groups (coin-
cidentally, the first was found quite
soon after that quoted query appeared),
the Burramys score so far is only a
single example: one that wandered
casually into a ski lodge on Mt. Hotham,
and there made itself comfortably at
home. Fortunately, the lodge’s occu-
pants realised that their little visitor—
Burramys is only lOin. long, including
6in. of tail—represented something
unusual, and so they boxed him up and
took him to Melbourne, thereby bring-
ing joy to astonished zoologists through-
out the land.
What next? Well, since it would
appear to be injudicious to regard the
stray of Mt. Hotham as the last of his
race, alpine searches for at least one
other example, preferably a female, are
obviously desirable. To that end, the
game’s afoot.
As to the other States, if none of
them has produced an ancient Aus-
tralian never seen in life before, some
have done pretty well in the rediscovery
of “missing friends,” not mammals but
very distinctive birds.
Western Australia set the precedent

PR3O-66
in 1961 by revealing the continued
existence of Atrichornis clamosus, a
small and secretive yet very strong-
voiced ground-dweller, loosely termed
scrub-bird, which had not been recorded
during more than 70 years. A small
colony was located in thick undergrowth
about 20 miles east of Albany. News
of this find made world headlines, and
eventually—just a few months ago —the
W.A. Government was persuaded to
cancel plans for the establishing of a
township, named in advance Casuarina,
in that area beside Two People Bay.
Actually, of course, the western scrub-
bird could have been located long ago
if some of the various searchers for it
'and there were quite a few earlier in
the century) had been equipped with
more resource and a bit of luck. This
is true, too, of a couple of “lost” species
recently rediscovered in South Aus-
tralia.
One of these, a small and very elusive
desert-dweller known as the Eyrean
grass-wren, was never actually lost; it
simply remained unviewed during 87
years (1874 to 1961) because of the
daunting nature of its habitat. But
when in August, 1961, five young fellows
from Melbourne forced their w r ay into
the Lake Eyre region they not only
found examples of the bird but photo-
graphed a nest with young.
South Australia’s second contribution
to the process of restoration is a whip-
bird. The species, sole relative of one
familiar in eastern Australia but lack-
ing the whip-crack call, was originally
found in the far west. There it had, and
still has, become rare. Unexpectedly, a
small colony was located in mallee
country in the far north-west of Vic-
toria and adjacent parts of South Aus-
tralia a few decades ago, but since
then it appears to have vanished from
that area.
Q UITE recently, however fand not to
the surprise of some of us), other small
groups have been discovered for the
first time in wild country on both Eyre
and Yorke Peninsulas and thus,
South Australia has the black-throated
whipbird back on its list.
The other two birds that come into
the “long-time-no-see” category are
both parrots. One, a dweller in the vast
interior and known as the night or
spinifex parrot, presents a difficult prob-
lem because it is largely nocturnal. The
other, the paradise or anthill parrot, is
a slim and beautiful bird of eastern
tropical areas that breeds in the ter-
restrial mounds of termites. Neither
of these species has come into orni-
thological view for many years (I am,
perhaps, the only living naturalist who
has seen the paradise parrot in life, and
that was over 40 years ago), but, from
information received, there is good rea-
son to believe that both birds are still
in existence, if sparsely.
Given fulfilment of those expecta-
tions, there wall remain on the missing
list only one distinctive member of
Australia’s fauna that was once known
to settlers but has not been seen, des-
pite many searches, for quite a long
time. This is the thylacine, Tasmania’s
marsupial “tiger.”
Thirty-three years have passed since
the last captive thylacine died in
Hobart’s zoo I saw it there, tramp-
ing about on broken concrete in a
small den and since then all
attempts to obtain another example
have failed. Nevertheless, I for one
have the impression that some few, if
very few, specimens of the curious
“tiger” still exist in the wild country
of western Tasmania.
While believing that, however, I draw
the line at a prediction made recently
by an Australian zoologist. “Dash it,”
he said, upon learning of the appear-
ance of the little Burramys possum,
“we’ll be running into Thylacoleo
next.”
But he spoke only in jest. For
Thylacoleo, which was also a mar-
supial “tiger” of sorts, sank into
oblivion many thousands of years ago.
And none at all of Australia’s large old-
timers, from the giant kangaroo to the
“tiger,” can be expected to repeat the
comeback performance of Burramys,
the little possum.


ARTS AND ENTERTAINMENT
Stimulating Perth
By DUNCAN GRAHAM
IN the pre-Christmas weeks every
year, Western Australians get their
first look at the summertime culture
menu prepared for them by the Festi-
val of Perth Committee.
After last season’s lavish and success-
ful Festival fare, some people suf-
fered from indigestion and said so.
Their complaints led to a closed two-
day evaluation seminar which the
critics and the committee held in a
beach-front hotel 30 miles south of
Perth.
Some of the seminar’s suggestions
have been used in the 15th festival,
starting on January 28 and now com-
pressed into five weeks, but others seem
to have been forgotten. One big com-
plaint centred on the Festival’s “high-
brow” programs which tended to ex-
clude Perth’s average citizen.
Certainly most of the activities,
staged in and around the lush and
beautiful university grounds, have tradi-
tionally drained their audiences from
the exclusive suburban catchment areas
where academics abound.
But next year the committee is giv-
ing, as an experiment, “good quality
popular entertainment, free of charge,
every weekend during the Festival.”
This will include jazz groups, folk-
singers, dancers, and bands. The
dilettante’s fun will be provided in a
central Perth open-air theatre in the
Supreme Court gardens.
Elsewhere, the $150,000 Festival will
be concerned with more earnest activi-
ties.
The 400th anniversary of Monte-
verdi’s birth will be celebrated in a
series of musical programs, but other
music sessions will include Australian
compositions. Invitations to submit
works have been sent to Australian
composers, and, if they respond, some
of the criticisms about the overdose of
imported material may be nullified.
On this controversial topic, Festival
executive officer John Birman is ada-
mant. “Perth’s Festival is not a pack-
aged deal like Adelaide’s,” he said. “In
our isolated community there must be
a balance of local productions and
talent with overseas and eastern States
imports. That way local artists can
learn more, not by watching but by
interacting. The Festival must stimu-
late Perth not smother her.”
Part of the stimulation will include
South Australian painter and musician
J. S. Ostoja-Kotkowski’s electronic
audio-visual show, “Sound and Image,”
seen at Adelaide’s Festival this year.
As a contrast to electronics, the com-
mittee will bring 30 Aboriginal dancers
from Yirrakala and Bathurst Islands to
perform a full-scale ballet program in
the open air against the backdrop of
natural bush in Perth’s 1000-acre King’s
Park. This show, an expected Festival
highlight, will cost $17,000 to bring to
Perth. The dancers, said Birman, will
be paid Equity rates.
The university’s open-air Elizabethan
replica, the New Fortune Theatre, came
in for some criticism recently by
the “West Australian” theatre critic,
Donna Sadka, because it is so little used.
It will be dusted off for a spectacular
presentation of “The Royal Hunt of the
Sun.”
The problem with the New Fortune,
once hailed by Tyrone Guthrie as a
unique theatrical achievement, is its
position. Surrounded by distraction-
prone Arts Faculty seminar rooms and
offices, it cannot be used, even for teach-
ing, during the academic year, and use
is even difficult out of term.
The Playhouse Theatre will present
Bernard Hesling in his own play, “My
Life With an Interval for an Aspirin,”
and the English musical hit “Oh What a
Lovely War.”
Films, including “Othello” and “The
Lord of the Flies,” will be spread
beyond the five-week Festival period
to counter charges that too much was
being presented in too little time.
The Elizabethan Theatre Trust Opera
Company is bringing over “Tosca” and
“The Barber of Seville” with a full
chorus and orchestra —an unusual event
for Perth theatregoers accustomed to
tape-recordings backing local shows.
ABC conductor John Hopkins will per-
form in concerts, one with a 150-voice
choir, set in the university’s magnificent
Winthrop Hall, now fitted out with a
full-size organ.
Local cut-price grocery magnate Tom
Wardle has dropped out of the art
prize field and has given his money
instead to music. Art benefactor Claude
Hotchin has filled his place, and the
Festival Art Prize will be worth $2OOO.
Together with Esso student awards,
this might provide good bait for rais-
ing dormant talent to the surface.
The art exhibition will be held in
the Skinner Galleries, a sore point with
many local artists who tried, unsuccess-
fully, to have the paintings shown in
the State Art Gallery, or some other
non-commercial venue instead.
A photographic exhibition of the
Gernsheim collection, Australian sculp-
ture, and a series of art exhibitions, in-
cluding a collection of Elwyn Lynn’s
works, will also feature in the Festival,
as will a local ballet, performed for the
first time on a specially erected stage
in the University’s Sunken Garden
Theatre.
Again for the first time, the Festival
will have a literary side to its multi-
faceted program. English writers and
critics Iris Murdoch and John Bayley
will take part in a seminar and in
sessions on the literature of protest
together with readings and dramatisa-
tions, all chaired by Max Harris.
Though modified and shortened,
Perth’s basic Festival format remains
unchanged. Bookings are only just start-
ing, but Festival records are expected
to be broken again.
Last year almost 154,000 people went
along, and with W.A. becoming better
known on the international scene each
year, there seems no reason why the
bulk of the expenditure should not be
recouped.
Making Opera Popular
By JOHN CARGHER
THIS year’s Elizabethan Opera Com-
pany’s season has finished, but
looking ahead it is clear that
the crucial point for local opera, with or
without the Sydney Opera House, will
be reached within the next few months.
Now that the N.S.W. Government
and the Sydney City Council have a
future invested in the Trust Opera
Company, it is likely that they will
attempt to get representation on the
Board. One must hope that they will
demand to see returns for their sub-
sidies in terms of audience attendances.
Opera is “pop” art. Its popularity
was built on its tunes, on the entertain-
ment provided by the stage spectacle,
and on fan worship of singers. All
three factors are still present in today’s
unprecedented opera boom in most
countries, except Australia. And even
here the sale of operatic recording is
high compared with attendances at live
performances. There is clear evidence
that audiences are ready and waiting
for the right tunes, the right entertain-
ment, and the right singers. The only
doubt is whether the Elizabethan
Theatre Trust can or will bow to the
demands of cash customers.
This year’s opera season is no yard-
stick of past or future standards. It
appears to be a hasty last-minute affair
which was surprisingly good. Why the
season should have been put together in
haste is hard to understand, since this
season has had a full two years for
preparation. “Boris Godounov” was
originally planned, I believe, with
Boris Christoff as star and then aban-
doned. Last year Edward Downes
assured me that he was coming to Aus-
tralia to conduct “Die Meistersinger,”
with Ronald Dowd as Walther. In


March or April this year “Meister-
singer” was still on the books. At that
point things started to go wrong:
Downes, Dowd, and Wagner suddenly
vanished and Boris reappeared without
Christoff. (No reflection on Neil Warren
Smith’s excellent Boris.)
Then someone decided that the suc-
cess of “The Consul” many years ago
could be duplicated by producing “The
Saint of Bleeker Street,” Menotti’s
greatest flop. Producer, designer, and
conductor were engaged (perhaps even
paid) before better counsel prevailed
and the opera was dropped. Yet as late
as June, only weeks before rehearsals
commenced, Trust publicity stated that
“a contemporary work” would be pre-
sented in Sydney and Melbourne. It
was much too late by then to start any-
thing new, but the fact that such an
announcement was made at that time
reflects the complete lack of realism
of the people in charge.
Original ideas by people with the
Trust management seem to have been
hidden or suppressed with greater suc-
cess than their ventures have enjoyed.
If ideas are there but cannot be ex-
ecuted because of pressure from above
(who is above Stefan Haag?) or lack of
money, then a threat of resignation
would very quickly determine whether
the resigner is indispensable. Mr. Utzon
is having no difficulty finding work, and
neither would any ex-Trust member
who resigned on matters of valid prin-
ciple. But all of the evidence indicates
that security of tenure is more impor-
tant than bringing home the bacon at
the box office.
On the artistic side things are not
quite so bad, though they raise more
comment through public exhibition.
The idea that Australian opera must
be performed only by Australians is
dying a natural death. After all, what
German opera house, presenting opera
in German, is without its American or
Australian contingent? The star system
is still the best insurance and claims
of “too expensive” can be answered
simply by the inscription in a cigarette
case given to Caruso: “To Caruso . . .
least dear of artists,” it said. The donor
had just paid the great tenor £stg.l4oo
per performance, knowing quite well
that each and every one would be a
complete sell-out at a handsome profit.
There was no loss made on Suther-
land nights last year, and had the Mel-
bourne season been at the Palais in-
stead of Her Majesty’s Theatre, an
overall profit would have been made.
The attempt to get Christoff, even
though it failed to materialise, and the
present negotiations with star artists
(who must remain anonymous for
obvious reasons) for next year are a
sign that the present administrator of
the opera company is aware of this fact
and it is to be hoped that his endeavors
meet with success. At the same time he
must refuse employment to singers who
cannot acquit themselves adequately;
the present low standard among sup-
porting artists is incomprehensible in
the light of past seasons. But the en-
gagement of Lauris Elms and Rosina
Raisbeck is a welcome sign that some
of the Trust’s past taboos are being
breached. There is hope that other
neglected local singers will appear on
Trust stages next year.
'J'HE standards of conductors and pro-
ducers have always been reasonably
high, though the latter have been ham-
strung by impossible sets at times. Aus-
tralian designers are world-class and
opera is a medium ideally suited to
the talents of people like John Trus-
cott, to name but-one. It is inconceiv-
able that such an artist would permit
the ugliness and senseless experiments
which have been allowed to ruin so
many productions. The current “Trova-
tore” is a good example. It succeeds on
musical grounds alone, for Verdi’s
score is strong enough and well sung
enough to overcome the revulsion which
the set produces in some scenes. The
same production with designs even of
only average standards would have been
a sensational success instead of leaving
audiences to tell their friends: “It was
very good indeed . . . but . It
would be better not to produce an
opera at all if it needs expensive sets
than to cause distraction from what may
be very good singing.
Even if the new permanent opera
company produces the right operas with
the right singers at the right time and
does succeed in establishing a beach-
head in Australia for this very popular
medium, what will become of the great
hopes we had for international seasons
in what is already the world’s most
famous, or infamous, opera house?

A Cold Eye
Loving Couples. Director, Mai Zetter-
ling.
Seduced and Abandoned. Director,
Pietro Germi.
AFTER several years as an actress,
Mai Zetterling turns director
so effortlessly that it is clear that
she used her eyes and ears to good pur-
pose during her time on the other side
of the camera. “Loving Couples” re-
veals complete professionalism; Mai
Zetterling for her first essay in direc-
tion takes a complex three-sided story
complete with interlocking flashbacks,
and deals with it like an old hand.
It’s a curious thing that Sweden’s
much-publicised liberality of attitude
toward sex doesn’t seem to do the
Swedes much good, if one is to judge
by their literature and drama. Miss
Zetterling joins the distinguished but
glum company of Ibsen, Strindberg,
Ingmar Bergman; the characters in the
film embark on sexual relations with
enthusiasm, but lasting emotional ties
are something else again. Throughout
the film the recurring motif is voiced
by the players—“people always let you
down, you can’t trust anyone”; to a
young girl marriage appears “like fall-
ing asleep for the rest of your life,” a
middle-aged cynic describes the rela-
tionship of man and woman as “30
seconds heaven, 30 years hell.”
Yet despite its bleak viewpoint the
film is lively and absorbing, and even


a new kind of
motor fuel.
Caltex Astron is the world’s most advanced
commercial motor fuel. It has a unique
combination of qualities possessed by no
other gasoline. Astron, developed by Caltex
Central Laboratories in Holland, keeps
your engine clean, protected and
operating at full efficiency
for longer than is possible
on other petrols.
CALTEX
with

HSTRON


has gleams of wintry humor, though the
very integrity of its uniformly cynical
attitude prevents any great sympathy
with its characters. The Scandinavian
eye that Mai Zetterling casts on the
story is so cold that a similar detach-
ment is felt by the spectator; the film’s
interest is intellectual, never emotional.
The linked stories deal with three
young women in a maternity hospital,
two awaiting the birth of their illegiti-
mate children fruit of that midsum-
mer night which, to judge by the
movies, must be responsible for most
of the Swedish birthrate the other,
married but desperately unhappy, to
have a dead baby removed from her
womb. By a series of deftly managed
flashbacks we are shown each woman’s
background and her education in the
untrustworthiness of men; the only one
who had adjusted herself at all is a
silly, self-indulgent girl incapable of any
feeling beyond the gratification of her
own impulses.
As in most Swedish films, the acting
is of high calibre (many of the players
are familiar from Bergman movies); the
clear, chilly black and white of the
photography is beautiful in itself, as
well as being admirably suited to the
calm, unemotional treatment, and the
soundtrack makes imaginative use of
natural sound.
Pietro Germi’s “Seduced and Aban-
doned,” which had an all too brief
release here, is being reissued, and
should not be missed. Once again
Germi examines the weird doublethink
of Sicilian morality. It is a more savage
film than “Divorce Italian Style,” in
fact, toward the end it occasionally
approaches perilously near to hysteria.
Aside from its own great merits, it
makes an interesting study in contrast to
“Loving Couples”; though both deal
with sexual morality and with the in-
herent cruelty of human relationships,
Germi is never detached from his char-
acters. His warmhearted involvement
with them occasionally leads him to
emotional excesses, but these spring
from a sincere love of his fellows; he
could never be guilty of the sometimes
over-rarefied atmosphere of Mai Zet-
terling’s film.

BALLET
Repeat Doses
Giselle and Pineapple Poll. Australian
Ballet, Palais, Melbourne.
WHEN a ballet company can stage
and sustain a capital city season
on purely repertory items with-
out novelties or guest stars, it has truly
justified its existence. Such a season
depends largely on repeat audiences
willing to pay for repeat doses of the
same ballets danced by the same dan-
cers. The only “attraction” the manage-
ment provides is numerous cast
changes. The Australian Ballet is strong
enough in its rank and file to provide
the latter; it only remains to follow
overseas practice in providing daily
program shuffles. Why should we have
to sit through “Pineapple Poll” if we
want to see “Giselle” and vice versa?
“Giselle” is still the best balanced
of the older classics and is ideal both
as an introduction to ballet and as a
vehicle for different dancers whose
interpretations can create controversy
among balletomanes. The first fist fight
between Gorham and Jones fans will in-
deed be a milestone for the Australian
Ballet! “Giselle” has by far the stron-
gest story line of any classical ballet.
Its drama is clearly stated in this pro-
duction, which must rank with the best
the ballet has seen in the 125 years
of its life. Peggy van Praagh’has made
further alterations, all for the better,
especially the transformation of the
milksop Wilfred into an older mentor,
and Albrecht’s spectacular fall in Act 2
has been restored.
I have never cared for Marilyn
Jones’ Giselle, but must admit there is
substantial recent improvement. Her
Mad Scene had many original and
genuinely touching moments. Techni-
cally she has always been strong, and if
she can bring this new softness into the
spirit world of the second act she may
yet equal her overseas competitors.
Bryan Lawrence has also improved his
characterisation further and his tech-
nique is beyond criticism. As a truly
masculine dancer, he is the strongest
inducement to use this production to
introduce newcomers to the imagined
land of pansydom. They will have a
rude, if pleasant, awakening.
“Pineapple Poll” is a further nail in
the same coffin, for it is full of virile
male dancing, delightful comedy, and
tuneful music. It should bring pleasure
in any of the many announced cast
changes. The orchestra plays Sullivan’s
melodies a lot better than Adam’s soul-
ful score.
JOHN CARGHER
THEATRE
Broadway
Bedroomese
The Owl and the Pussycat. Bill Man-
hoff. Russell Street, Melbourne.
THE Owl is an effeminate young
book salesman with avant-garde
literary ambitions. The Pussycat
is a boisterous prostitute who prefers
to think of herself as a model. The
Owl spies on and reports her sexual
proclivities to their mutual landlord,
and Pussy is evicted. With murder in
her heart, she gains entrance to the
Owl’s flat. But somehow, despite her
temper and Owl’s misogyny, the argu-
ment is resolved in bed. And so on.
Manhoff was a protege of Abe Bur-
rows, author of Melbourne’s other
piece of Broadway bedroomese, “The
Cactus Flower,” and while he com-
pletely runs out of steam in Act 3,
his play is a far superior piece of work.
Alan Hopgood is not one of my
favorite thespians, as he usually hides
the lights of his characters under a
bushel of mannerisms. But as the Owl
he emerges as an extremely skilful
comic. I can’t remember having seen
Anne Harvey before, but hope to
again. Her performance* along Shirley
Maclaine lines, was first class.. Kristian
Fredrikson contributed a useful set,
plus the series of decorative drawings
with which John Sumner punctuated
proceedings.
The production was, in a word, run-
cible.
PHILLIP ADAMS
Pinerotic
Trelawny of the Wells. Pinero. The
Players. Theatre 62, Adelaide.
Trelawny of the Weiis” is so
“well made” that from the second
act on, one can anticipate turns,
in the plot and even the all’s-well-that-
ends-well denouement. This is part of
the play’s charm, along with its genteel
humor and earnest presentation of late
Victorian theatrical types. Audiences
respond enthusiastically to its conven-
tions because they are, I suspect, nos-
talgic for theatrical peace. To go, as I
did, from “Who’s Afraid of Virginia
Woolf?” to “Trelawny of the Wells”
is to go from Armageddon to the vicar-
age. Yet the two plays are in a
historical sense related. Pinero wanted
to “make his people talk and behave
like live people,” and this play is con-
cerned with the problems his new drama
faced. One wonders how he would have
reacted to Albee’s people. We can now
see that Pinero’s (then revolutionary)
realism moderated rather than departed
from late Victorian theatrical conven-
tions.
The cast is one of the strongest
assembled in Adelaide this year, and
the performances are of a high and
consistent standard. Everyone treads a
delicate path between a straight con-
ception of his role and the occasional,
necessary overstatements. An example
of the method is seen in Ray Wheeler’s
Tom Wrench, the playwright. He is
earnestly good-natured, sensible, and
straight, but over this Mr. Wheeler
lays a dreamy glaze of Victorian lack-
love and self-pity.
Rose Trelawny is a petite heroine,
sweet, simple, warm-hearted, slightly
sentimental. Barbara West’s concep-
tion of the role added a certain suf-
fragette spirit, and gave herself room
for really clever comedy. In the hands
of a lesser actress the part could have
been merely plot furniture. Miss West
makes it intrinsically enjoyable. The
same could be said for Daphne Grey’s
Avonia Bunn, which is a high-spirited
exercise in light cockney, very pleas-
antly soubrette, and for Kathleen Steele
Scott’s Miss Trafalgar Gower, whose
tall, gangling, absurdly proper middle-
aged spinster is straight from Ronald
Searle.
The whole presentation is in very
good humor, what Shaw called “Pine-
rotic.” It should really be described
as a panto for adults, just right for the
season.

CAN MOVE
30.000 TONS OF
COAL A DAY!
A5BO/7
At Morwell Victoria, the longest single-flight,
high-speed conveyor system in Australia is
carrying brown coal from the open cut to Hazel-
wood Power Station, 1f miles away. Plans for the
conveyor system were adopted by the State
Electricity Commission Victoria after a thorough
investigation of all means of transporting coal
over such a distance.
Built to exacting specifications by Goodyear
Tyre and Rubber Co. (Australia) Ltd., the two
steel cable conveyors operate at a speed of 1050
feet a minute carrying 2000 tons of coal an hour.
The belts are 7244 feet and 8560 feet long, 48
inches wide, approximately f inch thick and con-
sist entirely of rubber and 500 miles of steel
cables. Minimum breaking strength is 423,000
pounds. The structure of the belt allows the cable
maximum lateral movement. There is no tearing
under impact!
The seven miles of Goodyear belting used on
the two mainlines for Hazelwood is another
example of the numerous advantages of steel
cable belting. It has an extremely high tensile
strength. Its design makes it trough perfectly and
have the best impact resistance of any belt con-
struction. Stretching and elongation is negligible
so short take up lengths are possible.
If you have a project where you need conveyor
belting remember Goodyear conveyor belting. It’s
the best. Contact the Goodyear technical man at
the Goodyear branch in y° ur state.

MUSIC
Singing Volumes
Raymond Myers. Sydney Conser-
vatorium.
IN December, 1962, during his first
visit to Sydney, Dean Dixon con-
ducted the Mozart Requiem and, in
that performance, introduced a fine
young bass, Raymond Myers, almost un-
known to the general public. After some
work with the Elizabethan Trust Opera
Company, Mr. Myers went abroad
and worked extensively in Great
Britain, Italy, and elsewhere; he has
now returned to Australia for a brief
visit.
Even four years ago, when he won
the Sydney Opera House Competition,
no one could doubt the quality of Mr.
Myers’ voice; by now, wisely calling
himself a baritone rather than a bass,
it is even finer. Success in music, how-
ever, calls for more than just a fine
instrument. Mr. Myers’ first Sydney
recital was a sad disappointment.
Part of my disappointment was the
programming. At pre-war suburban and
charity concerts it was customary to
include operatic arias as well as
“favorites,” and the great singers of the
day, such as Peter Dawson or Harold
Williams, rightly sang such items.
Nowadays we are a little more sophisti-
cated musically and it seems to me that
a recital at the Conservatorium need no
longer include Vaughan - Williams’
“Vagabond,” Ireland’s “Sea Fever,” or
Bridge’s “Love Went A-Riding.
Unfortunately, the inclusion of these
items proved to be symptomatic. Mr.
Myers’ musicianship is not, regrettably,
equal to the standard of his voice. It is
a big voice, of enormous dramatic im-
pact, and at its most impressive at the
bass end of his range. A voice of such
magnitude needs to be restrained and
modulated, but we heard it, almost
throughout, either forte or fortissimo.
There were some few fleeting moments
of something like a mezzoforte, but a
true piano does not seem to exist in the
singer’s repertoire.
Perhaps in an attempt to prove his
versatility, Mr. Myers included every
possible genre. He opened with Han-
del’s “Honour and Arms” aria from
“Samson”; this florid warhorse was sung
with exemplary clarity, considerable
drama and quite shattering volume.
Brahms’ “Four serious songs,” to
biblical texts, were less enjoyable. These
are, as their title suggests, serious, but
that is hardly the same thing as a fear-
somely dramatic interpretation. The
songs are among the most difficult in
the literature and even experienced,
German-speaking lieder singers usually
avoid them. Mr. Myers would be well
advised to do likewise, at least until
he gains a genuine undestanding of the
texts, dynamic restraint, and a feeling
for the phrasing demanded by Brahms’
music. Donald Hollier, a thoroughly
competent accompanist throughout,
proved to be much more at ease in
Raymond Myers
Brahms’ music than the singer and pos-
sibly deserved to be heard on his
own.
Musically, the event of the evening
was Britten’s 1965 cycle “Songs and
Proverbs of William Blake,” which
had not been performed in Sydney be-
fore. The cycle was written for Fischer-
Dieskau and it is no disgrace for any
singer if he cannot emulate that sup-
reme artist. Although Mr. Myers’ inter-
pretation was somewhat lacking in fin-
esse and in attention to dynamic and
other details, he proved that he can,
in fact, subdue his enormous voice oc-
casionally. His reading was such that
one had no difficulty identifying the
songs as being Britten’s; they are beauti-
ful indeed and will, I believe, take their
rightful place among the composer’s
finest recent vocal works.

More Condottieri

French Art. Clune Galleries, Sydney.
Selected Works. Darlinghurst Galleries,
Sydney.
WHAT is expected from a real
dealer? He is to be both exca-
vator and hunter. He digs in
unlikely and obscure places for
treasures; he hunts in tangled forest
and treacherous terrain for rarities; he
wins what the armchair collector has
rarely the time, knowledge, or reckless-
ness to find for himself. The grand
dealer salts away works to dazzle with
a show of, say, colonial portraits, the
formative years of Roberts and Streeton,
or Nolan’s early abstractions. He may
even subsume, as in New York at
present, a whole show under the com-
prehensive title of Silence. This year
saw two theme shows that were partially
shows of the unexpected—the nude at
Gallery A and landscape at the Darling-
hurst —but the salting-away stage is
beyond local dealers at present: in fact,
the pattern, in its liveliest form, is set
by the Stern Galleries, where finds
hardly have time to stay overnight.
Some dealers simply wait for works
to appear, but generally the true dealer
is more condottieri than consultant and
Mr. Frank McDonald, now owner of
Clune’s, presents the results of his
fourth raid, or perhaps excursion, to
Europe. It is generally a lamentable
show, as though the lights were going
out over Europe again.
In the dream time Mr. McDonald
envisioned a rise in the appreciation in
price and appeal of Australian art by
accustoming the local market to high
prices and superior work; the public
was to trust —and why not?—the
informed, tastemaking dealer. Mr.
McDonald’s taste, however, despite the
fine Epsteins and the magnificently
muddy Dubuffet he commandeered in
the past, tends to the chi-chi, ephemeral,
the boudoir bouquet, the decorative, and
the derivative. It is not surprising that
Mr. McDonald’s new gallery in Mac-
quarie Street will open in 1967 with a
show of that established new Austra-
lian, Conrad Martens (1801-1878).
Once again we have the fleshy,
abstract cliches of Aizpiri, Cavailles’
enfeeblement of Matisse, one Trup-
hemus that confuses impressionism with
scrambled eggs and another that tames
Fauvism with skittish decoration. Who
are these gugs? A Trouillebort of 1874
is not up to the standard of a good
forged Corot, and Oudot’s bit of sea and
shore is charmless Charm School. The
nadir of taste is Gualtieri’s L’Amour,
where two sweet birds in gaudy red
cane cage nibble one another’s beaks
and eggs in a nest aglow with baby
pink. Such sugary sentimentality is
only equalled in the great art of the
Australian country calendar. Even
Buffet has looked better; his Bord de
Mer (1961), with spiky black trees
and stark white houses, has a remote
coldness, but his flower piece is deplor-
able. Hasn’t Buffet any friends to tell
him, or are they all dealers?
Is there enough to redeem the show?
Hardly. The Bonnard bronze of 1910
is inconsequential; the Modigliani
drawings are lissom and graceful, but
not masterly; the Cezanne drawings
amalgamate rotund forms with com-
prehensive rhythms, that are reflected
in the heavy, monumental Gaudier
Brezeska, not given, like the Buffets or
Aizpiris, to vain repetition.
Best are two Daumier bronzes, con-
centrated caricatures of unpleasant
people, whose faces and bodies reveal
their crooked souls: Monsieur Qui
Ricane and L’Avocat Salant, which
might be translated by those who think
of dealers in Aesopian terms as “The
man who laughs derisively” and “The
lawyer who fleeces.”
While the dealer offers minor works
by minor names, the buyer is reason-
ably safe, and Australia has seen no
need for an Art Dealers’ Association
like that founded in U.S.A. in 1962
to reveal successfully fakes, frauds, mal-


practice, and erroneous appraisals. But
ADA, as they call it, blows like an
honest hurricane through American
dealing and . . . caveat emptor.
Donald Friend, who shows a de-
lightful pink-icing version of Hill End
at the Darlinghurst, once “forged” a
colonial painting for fun and was de-
lighted to hear the then “Sydney Morn-
ing Herald” critic say that Friend was
not capable of doing it! He is in mixed
company that ranges from a pile of
granite rocks of eroded splendor by
Rees, a fluid New Guinea Landscape
by Dobell, an excellent oil sketch by
Miller, where the strokes fly like chaff,
and a cool, snowy street by Eric Wilson,
to some curiosities, like a Chinoiserie
lady by Roberts, and Lambert’s quiet,
dull sketch for his magnificent “Across
the Black Soil Plains” in the N.S.W.
Gallery, where, on loan, is a painting
by Roberts of Thunderbolt, amid the
hard-edge rocks, firing on the police
and rehabilitating Roberts’ reputation.
The largest curio is Sir George Clau-
sen’s “Peasant Family” (1884), healthy,
stalwart, and a match for any grain
dealer around.

Encouragement?
Metropolitan Opera Auditions. Town

IT remains to be seen whether the in-
clusion of Australia (as the U.S.’s
51st State?) in the Metropolitan
Opera auditions is a good thing. We
should welcome the financial and
artistic encouragement it gives to young
singers, but I have doubts whether the
winning of competitions benefits im-
mature artists anywhere. The number
who make the top is, distressingly small
when one considers the immense raw
talent brought to light each year. The
artificial and purely temporary fame of
strenuous concerts and travelling is a
poor substitute for experience gained
the legitimate way, through sheer hard
work.
All this applies doubly to Australian
singers. This year’s final was a concert
by six fully polished professionals
which could be and was enjoyed by a
capacity audience. Yet their profession-
alism was of the concert stage while
they were, in fact, auditioning for an
operatic career. Surely there must be
some way in which these singers can
be used in local opera production in-
stead of allowing them escape over-
seas. Two or three Trust Opera seas-
ons would double or treble their chances
of succeeding beyond the audition stage
and, quite incidentally, the infusion of
talented youth into local seasons would
greatly enhance their potential success
at the box office.
The winner of the auditions was
Marilyn Richardson, a Sydney soprano
old enough (30) to retain her magni-
ficent voice in the face of trials to
come. Her singing of Zerbinetta’s aria
from “Ariadne Auf Naxos” was an
outstanding performance by any stan-
dard. Lynne Cantlon and Valerie Han-
lon, the place-getters, could be valu-
able additions to the local operatic
scene or perhaps Sadler’s Wells. How-
ever, their chances of getting on to
the stage of the Met. seem slim.
In this company one could only feel
sorry for the other place-getters. In
other years they might well have gained
one of the three trips to Honolulu to
compete in the Pan-Pacific finals. One
Australian will from there be guaran-
teed a place in the New York finals,
but since all the top places were won
by Australians in the two years our
singers have competed, the chances are
a lot better than one in three. Malcolm
Donnelly may well make it in two or
three years’ time: His fine baritone is
limited only by years (23) and experi-
Marilyn Richardson
ence. Janice Taylor may not, though
she has beauty as well as voice. John
Pringle was clearly the audience’s choice
and might have won in a vocal compe-
tition. But this was an audition, and
a baritone who auditions bass arias,
no matter how well sung, must be
judged as a bass. In that capacity
Pringle was rightly ruled out by the
judges.

TELEVISION
Mindless Delight
Nice ’n Juicy. ABC-TV.
Marvel Heroes. Channel 9.
Impact. ABC-TV.
New Industrial Revolution. ABC-TV.
THE choice is often between “Nice
’n Juicy” and “Marvel Heroes,”
although the names may be
different. “Nice ’n Juicy” is ABC-
Television’s first home-grown series,
set on an orchard owned by two
derelict brothers, who are absurd but
not funny. One, John Ewart, eats
quantities of oranges. The other,
Willie Fennell, makes spongecakes.
And these comprise the more dramatic
moments of their “comedy”! In
“Marvel Heroes” viewers find another
of the benefits of television horror
comics come to life, complete with
such scintillating, hand-hewn dialogue
as, “I must save humanity from Glug.
Take that, GIug—KERUNCH!”
The two approaches can be com-
bined, as in the ABC’s “The Board
Riders,” half of a split showing in the
“Impact” series. In this, brothers and
sisters under the suntan describe the
attractions of their “sport” in such
terms as, “It gets you. You don’t want
to do anything else. Just the sun and
the sea and the wave you’re on. It’s
terrific.” And fashionably mindless.
At night, when the waves are unat-
tainable, you can watch “Marvel
Heroes” before bed and dreamless
sleep. Who can criticise such dedica-
tion to the true delights of life?
There were no such lotus-eaters in
the other half of “Impact,” a short,
pacy study of Australian women called
“Bird in a Gilded Cage.” There was a
reference to them as “Queen Bees,”
the active young who have retired to
their cells in the hive, to go-go no
more, but the many speakers for the
anti-Queen Bees were voluble. Not
necessarily right, but voluble. None
attempted to explain the Queen Bee
as a phenomenon, other than to blame
her plight on a “man’s world.” Could
it be that too many are domestic
“board riders” at heart? “Bird in a
Gilded Cage” was an excellent tele-
vision study, written and directed by
Brett Porter, with smart graphics by
John Endean, barbed comments by
Andrea; and by Porter, who sketched
in the exciting part women’s magazines
play in women’s lives romance,
cooking, sewing, romance, cooking,
etc. Television’s part, unfortunately,
was not covered equally.
To follow “Impact,” someone at the
ABC had the bright idea of showing
the BBC’s “New Industrial Revolution”
before one hour of the Israel Phil-
harmonic, instead of around midnight
as on the previous week. Besides dem-
onstrating how to make a potentially
dull subject visually interesting (com-
puters, not the Philharmonic), the
BBC managed to convey the urgency
of understanding the new revolution
and its effects. Even an ABC program-
mer (television, not computers) could
understand the benefits of showing it
when the audience could reasonably be
expected to be still awake.
The BBC man commented on Eng-
land’s slowness to be with the revo-
lution, compared to the U.S. and
“across the channel.” The ABC might
have added a local comment. How far
are we behind Japan, for instance, in
understanding what is happening, and
what it means in terms of area market
competition; and on our general future
as thinking people, or “board riders.”

THE
HOSTILE
VOICES
SHORT STORY BY IAN MUDIE
SHE stood in the middle of the big,
empty classroom, staring at the
blank pages of her autograph book.
She didn’t care that she had never
had the courage to ask anyone else to
write in it. Other people had never
really seemed to matter. She didn’t
want their silly old autographs, any-
way. But if only she could have had
his! It would have meant so much to
her. Until now, when things were bad
and she was driven close to tears, she
had always tried to think of one of
the chapters of his book. The one
about the time he was separated from
his companions on the Ross Ice Shelf
in the worst blizzard he had ever seen
was the best. If she thought of it hard
enough the teasing and the mocking
laughter of other children and of
adults, and the anger of teachers and
her parents, didn’t seem to hurt so
much. But sometimes it wouldn’t work.
Then, try as hard as she could, the
sound of their voices and their laughter
made her wish that she could suddenly
be invisible, or that she knew some
words that could make her twenty-one
within a couple of seconds and no
longer the girl with red pigtails and
freckles that everybody laughed at or
got cross with.
If only, she told herself, she had
managed to get his autograph there
would no longer have been times like
that. She would have been completely
safe from them all. Just to think of
the magic words of his name, written
by him, would have been all she needed.
Nobody could have hurt her then.
W ITH . the thought of his signature—
written just for her—to help her
she could, she felt sure, have been able
to do her gymnastic exercises properly,
so that the other girls wouldn’t laugh
at her. And the boys would have for-
gotten the horrible rhyme they’d made
up about her freckles. And mental
arithmetic . . . ! The answers would
have turned out to be correct when, be-
cause she couldn’t think when everyone
was looking at her, she tried to guess
them and then Miss Hocking
wouldn’t say nasty things like she did
now because the answers were never
anywhere near right. And her mother
wouldn’t be cross with her any more
for standing by the sink imagining her-
self the daughter of the President of
the United States of America instead
of doing the washing-up. And Heather,
her elder sister, would stop calling her
“Runt.” And Miss MacDonald would
stop lining up the class by sizes, so she
always had to go first; and she wouldn’t,
as the smallest girl, have to sit in the
front row or she might even grow a
couple of inches taller. And when her
next school report came in her father
would forget to give her what he
called “a serious talking-to” ... or,
even better, her report would have
Good and Excellent all over it . . .
She stared at the blank pages of the
book. She had funked asking him; now
nothing would come right. Losing her
nerve had stopped her from possessing
the magic of his signature. After he had
finished his talk to the school she had
rushed to her desk for the book so that
she could ask him to sign it. She had
gone halfway across the school yard to
where he was walking toward the
teachers’ common-room with Mr. Hen-
derson and some of the other teachers
and the man who had brought him to
the school to speak. Halfway, and then
she had stopped. Her old fear of people
. . . her fear of asking for something in
case she would be laughed at . . . had
come over her . . .
She had turned tail and come back
to the classroom. On the way she had
begun by swinging the autograph book
in her hand, as if she only happened
to be carrying it by chance. Then she
had pushed it up under the side of her
pullover, holding it in place with her
elbow, so that no one would see it.
By the time she reached her desk she
had been almost running.
She felt her face grow hot. What if
some of the others had seen her! She
couldn’t think of any story to make up
. . . not one that anyone would believe.
They would be sure to tease her about
it . . . start passing notes to one another
in class . . . whispering behind her
back . . .
But it wouldn’t do any good to go
to Miss MacDonald and say that she
felt sick or that she had a pain in her
stomach and thought she had better
go home. Last time she’d tried that Miss
MacDonald had merely said not to
eat her lunch she’d probably feel
better then . . .
Why hadn’t she asked him! Others
could. Girls walked straight up to pop
singers without blushing and said, “Can
I have your autograph?” And boys did
the same to footballers and cricketers.
And no one ever laughed at them, or
refused . . . And yet she had turned
back, frightened, when she was halfway
across the yard . . .
And had spoilt the whole day. After
it had started off so wonderfully, too.
Everything had gone right, right from
the start. For once she’d put her hair-
ribbons together the night before, and
this morning she hadn’t had any trouble
finding them, as well as all the books
she had to take to school. And on the
way through the park her favorite mag-
pie the one with the twisted leg
had been sitting on the dead limb of
the big gum tree. So she was able to
say to him, “Oh, you beautiful bird,”
and that was something that never failed
to bring her luck, really special luck
that usually lasted all day long.
when she had arrived at school
none of the boys had noticed her as
she crossed the playground. They hadn’t
even glanced up from the model plane
that one of them had brought from
home. Not one of them had chased her
and stolen one of her hair-ribbons, pre-
tending he wasn’t going to give it back.
And none of them had sung out their
“Jane, Jane, Jane” rhyme . . .
And then, first thing after the bell
had rung, Mr. Henderson made his
announcement, “ . . . famous Antarctic
explorer ... all classes will assemble at
ten-thirty . .
And no one round her had noticed
the look oh her face; no one had whis-
pered “Jane Flytrap catch flies if
you don’t close your mouth.”
All through the first two periods
she’d been too excited to pay attention
to lessons. But her darling magpie-
luck, which so rarely failed her, had
held good. Neither Miss Hocking nor
Miss MacDonald had noticed that she
wasn’t paying attention to the work.
They hadn’t spoken sharply to her
once. It almost seemed as if neither of
them even noticed she was there.
When, after a short recess, the whole
school filed into the assembly hall, she
thought her luck had deserted her. For
a minute she had a horrible hollow
feeling in what she supposed was her
stomach. Her class was going to have
to sit in the last two rows, and she
could see that she was going to be in
the very back one, right against the
wall. Some of the taller girls would be
sure to sit in front of her, and she
wouldn’t be able to see the speaker
properly.
Of course, she could have stood up;


there would be no one behind whose
view she could spoil. But she wouldn’t
dare; she could still remember what
happened when she did that the time
the man came and lectured to them on
birds. She had only wanted to see the
nest he was pointing to on the table in
front of him. She still felt hot and
found herself hunching her shoulders
together and pulling her head down
as if she wanted to hide between them
whenever she thought of the way one
of the senior masters had hissed, “Does
that little girl who is standing up in
the back row want to leave the room?”
But today it had been all right. She
had been in the. back row, yes, but in
the best position in the whole hall.
The back row, being against the wall,
didn’t have any break for the aisle
it didn’t have to and she’d found
herself sitting there, staring straight up
at the platform. That’s the kind of day
it had been till she went and spoilt
everything . . .
When they were all in their places,
Mr. Coolidge, the assistant headmaster,
stood watching out of a window, smack-
ing at a fly with a bunched-up corner
of his gown. Suddenly he whirled
round. “Stand up!” he ordered the
school.
There was the usual shuffling of feet,
whispering, and scraping of chairs. Then
there was a swish of gowns, murmurs
of “After you!” and the official party
had stamped up to the platform, Mr.
Coolidge glaring at the school to keep
silent before he followed the others.
Mr. Henderson stood up. “Right!”
He waved his hand. “Sit!”
Scrape of chairs and shuffle of feet
again; then she was staring up the
aisle at the tall man with the lean face
and the brown eyes. So that was him!
Really him!
She supposed now that Mr. Hender-
son must have introduced him, but she
couldn’t remember. All she could
remember was the way she had put
her hands on her knees and leaned for-
ward as the explorer stood up.
H E put his hands in his pockets; then
he took them out again. He
coughed. He strained his head up and
back, as if his collar was too tight. Then
he began to speak . . .
She listened to his voice. And she
watched his smile as he told them of his
travels in that strange landscape that
surrounds the Pole. As he spoke he
seemed to be looking straight along
the strip of rather dirty coconut mat-
ting that ran from the foot of the plat-
form to her feet. It was as if he was
talking only to her. As if each time he
smiled he smiled at her . . .
And she sat there looking up at him,
thinking how strong and fearless he was
and how much at ease. And she wished
she could tell him how much it meant
to her for him to be there. Wished she
could tell him how she had read his
book again and again, living over and
over with him his travels through that
land of ice . . .
She had borrowed the book from the
school library quite by chance. It had
been the first one she had seen on the
shelves that day which was obviously
written for grown-ups, and so she had
taken it quickly to be checked out by
the prefect who was acting as assistant
before Miss Dunkley, the school
librarian, could give her the usual lec-
ture on reading books that were, ac-
cording to Miss Dunkley, too old for
her to understand.
As she was walking back to the
classroom with it she had passed several
boys standing under a veranda. They
had at once set up their horrid chant:
Jane, Jane, Jane,
Freckles is stain;
Won’t come off in the heaviest rain.
Why, oh, why, she had wondered
bitterly, did everyone have to tease
her? Plenty of other girls were red-
haired and had freckles. But she seemed
to be the only one who had fun poked
at her for it.
“It isn’t fair,” she had whispered to
herself, “it isn’t fair.” And instead of
going on the long way across the play-
ground to the classroom she went
quickly to the girls’ lavatory so that
the boys would stop chanting at her.
There was no one else in there, and
so, to give the boys time to forget
about her and go away, she opened
the first page and began to read. And,
as she read, it almost seemed as if the
first words had been written for her:
“Each time I land on the Antarctic
continent I have a strange feeling of
fear as if hostile voices are jeering
at me. Yet I go back time and time
again, drawn by I know not what
attraction, perhaps a desire to learn
not to be afraid of those voices.”
“The hostile voices!” she had
thought; that was what she was afraid
of, the hostile voices all around her
When she arrived home that after-
noon she had read on, and on, and
on. And she had known she must have
a copy of the book for herself, to read
again and again, so that she could
think of his courage in crossing the
Ross Ice Shelf, and all the other won-
derful things he had done, and so that
she could use the thought of how brave
he was, use it to muffle the hostile
voices, so that they wouldn’t ring so
insistently in her ears. Not that the
thought could prevent her being afraid
of them, but once she had her own
copy of the book specially asked
for as a birthday present she never
cried about them at night again. She
just went to sleep with her fingers
touching the book, which she always
put under her pillow.
She often thought how wonderful it
would be if she could meet him.
“Do you know my book?” he would
ask her.
And for answer she would say a
whole chapter through to him, word for
word. Without any of the gaps and
stumblings that happened when she
tried to say a paragraph through to
herself but she was sure that those
gaps and stumblings were because she
always did it to stop herself from cry-
ing about something.
As she listened to him this morning,
and smiled when he smiled, she had
thought of the autograph book.
It had still been fairly new the morn-
ing she had told her mother that a man
was coming to school that day to talk
to them about birds.
“Oh, how nice, dear,” her mother
had said in her sweetest, most accus-
ing voice. “Why don’t you take that
lovely autograph book to school that
I gave you last Christmas and get him
to sign it? I happened to pick it up the
other day when I was trying to get
your room into some sort of order.
Why, you haven’t got one autograph
in it yet!”
she had brought it to school. But
of course she hadn’t liked to ask
the birdman for his autograph—hadn’t,
she told herself, particularly wanted to.
And after that the book had remained
at the bottom of her desk, still empty.
At times she had wanted to ask various
people to sign it but had never
really wanted to yet in the end she
had been afraid to ask them.
But she had really wanted his auto-
graph oh, so desperately. As soon
as his talk to them she almost
thought of it as his talk to her was
ended she raced back to the classroom,
grabbed the book, and started to hurry
out toward where she guessed Mr.
Henderson would be crossing the play-
ground with him, on the way to the
teachers’ common-room.
But as she had gone out across the
yard there had been the usual feeling
of panic, the feeling of being unable
to approach people . . . And now all
she had to show for the morning’s ex-
perience were the blank pages of the
book in her hands.
Maybe, later on, she would be able
to forget the humiliation, or at least
not feel so miserable about it, and re-
live in her memory the wonderful ex-
perience of listening to his talk, of
watching his smile. But now . . .
Suddenly there was a voice beside
her, a long way, it seemed, above her
head.
“Excuse me; did you want my auto-
graph?”
She nodded. It was all she could
do.
“I’m so glad,” he said. Then, when
she didn’t say anything, he went on.
“I saw you come toward me and then
turn back. I was almost afraid to come
after you. I thought the others might
laugh at me.”
“Laugh at you?”
“Yes. But I was glad of the chance
of speaking to you. I wanted to thank
you for being so nice in there when
I was talking.”
“N-nice?”
“Yes. When I stand up like that
and find a whole lot of people staring
at me I get so scared. I’m afraid they

He took the autograph book from her
hands. “What’s your name?”
“Jane.”
“Jane that’s my favorite name.”
He began to write “To Jane . . .”
Then he paused. “But when there’s
someone special in the audience, like
you, it makes a difference. Like this
norning. I could see that you liked me,
liked what I was saying. It was as if
we were talking to each other just
the two of us. And when you smiled
at me I knew that we were.”
She gulped. So she was right; he
had been smiling at her . . . just at
her.
“The hostile voices . . .” she whis-
pered.
He finished writing and put his pen
back in his pocket. “The hostile voices?
Oh, yes, that’s it. When I look down
at a whole mob of people like that >t’s
just like hearing the hostile vi-.ces.
People have no idea how scared I am
of them. But this morning you made
me forget all that.”
She tried to speak but couldn’t.
He started. “I’d better go. They’ll be
wondering wherever I am.”
£JHE looked up at him, and suddenly
realised that he was scared of Mr.
Henderson, too that he was scared
of everyone, just like she was.
“Goodbye, Jane, and thanks again.”
“Goodbye,” she whispered.
They smiled at each other; then he
turned and almost ran out of the room.
When he had gone she realised that
several of her usual tormentors were
watching her through a window at the
far end of the room.
“Jane, Jane, Jane . . they began
to chant.
But she didn’t let them go any
further. She waved the autograph book
at them, for it was now both her wand
and her shield. “You’re only jealous,”
she told them, her voice much louder
than usual, “because I was game to
talk to him and you weren’t.” She
screwed up her nose at them. “Cowardy,
cowardy custards . .
Then she walked quickly, her back
to them, out of the door. If they’d
seen her face they would have been
silly enough to think she was crying
because of them . . .
“The hostile voices,” she thought,
“I’ll never be scared of them again.”
And she hoped that on her way home
through the park the magpie with the
twisted leg would be on his usual
branch. She’d hold the autograph book
up toward him and say, “Thank you,
you beautiful, beautiful bird.”
And she wished that he could be
as happy as she was.

BOOKS
Australian Furies
By JAMES KIRKUP
Australian Poetry, 1966. 25th Anniver-
sary number. Selected by David Camp-
bell. Angus and Robertson. $1.75.
WHAT do non-Australians like my-
self expect of modern Australian
poetry? That it should be
modern, Australian, and, if possible,
poetry. But it should also, we feel,
have some extra quality, some specific
Australian “thing” which can be con-
veyed only by poets who live and work
on that continent. Such unmistakable
“thingness” emerges from a novel by
Patrick White, “Riders In the Chariot”
his only great novel the poetry
of Randolph Stow (not represented in
the volume under review), and from
modern Australian and Aboriginal arts.
Does this special “thingness” make
itself felt in “Australian Poetry, 1966”?
Yes and no. There are, it seems, Aus-
tralian poets today who quite righth
wish to be thought of not just as local
phenomena writing in a local idiom but
as poets of the world. Others are
almost defiantly Aussie.
It is interesting to try to evaluate
these two types, the firmly antipodal
and the vaguely international. The
former are usually superior poets, with
a true national identity. The latter
inevitably are influenced sometimes by
the awful, dead literary suburbanism
and academic insularity of today’s
dreary English poetic scene. It is
chiefly for this reason that they are,
from the outset, less vital and less
original than what we might call “the
natives.”
JJOWEVER, a. few very good poets
seem to have been able to assimilate
the best of Europe and America and to
combine native and international modes
successfully. It is to these fine poets I
should like mainly to address my atten-
tion.
Among them, the name of J. M.
Couper—a name new to me in my
ignorance seems pre-eminent. His
“versions” of Rimbaud and Horace
become new, vigorous, and brilliant
poems in their own right, with bold
Australian cultural and political con-
notations. The famous Horace ode
about a flirty girl called Pyrrha, begin-
ning quis multa gracilis, is utterly trans-
formed in language, style, and setting.
Pastoral Italy becomes Surfers Paradise
and Pyrrha of the scented locks becomes
a beefy all-Australian bitch called—
Betjemanesquely—Angela, “reeking of
suntan.” Her poet addresses her cava-
lierly but quite unlike a Cavalier poet —
irreverently and with a rasping, twang-
ing post-amorous bitterness.
Couper’s version of Rimbaud seems
to me even more remarkable. Appar-
ently the original was the sonnet begin-
ning “Morts de Quatre-vingt-douze et
de Quatre-vingt-treize,” but the con-
tents have been so transformed as to
make it almost impossible to identify
the source. Couper has altered the form
to half-rhymed (or rather off-rhymed)
Shakespearian sonnet (and here the
clinching couplet is savagely satisfying);
it serves well his demolishing scorn for
some “elected crackpot” and
some mild myopic runt of a fellow
in parliament because of a meddle-
some tic,
or any plausible rascal to work a com-
mittee
and tip his boundless disasters on
you and me.
Great! The tone of voyou indigna-
tion, personal passion and disgust
with war and war-makers is an
authentic marriage of Rimbaud with
R. D. Fitzgerald
gutsy Australian grunts and spits. Rim-
baud’s despised royalty becomes
Couper’s jobbers.
Both of these renderings are outstand-
ing achievements in interpretation and
adaptation, going much further, and
deeper, than any of Robert Lowell’s
effete, prosaic “Imitations.” They are
the best poems in the book.
The same heartburn and frustrate
fury come into Bruce Dawe’s tor-
mentedly formal verses and into Les A.
Murray’s cooler “Manoeuvres.” The
latter poet has, in “Beside the High-
way,” the sort of poem I meant —one
that brings us the smell of Australia,
this time in the shape of a very un-
romanticised Aboriginal settlement. In
the same Australian sense of place and
time and people I like Roland Robin-
son’s “The Cradle” and the editor’s
(David Campbell’s) sonnet “Soldier
Settlers,” deeply convincing, and with
a cleverly used Cockney rhyme—
“gnaw” and “floor.” Among other
“native” yet sophisticated poems are
good ones by Charles Higham
(“O’Leary”) and Bruce Beaver (“The
Cranes of Auckland”). Another admir-
able poem is Robert D. Fitzgerald’s
“One Such Morning”: this poet must
surely be regarded as Australia’s Robert
Frost, though his poem is, in its own
pawky way, inimitable; it is that very
rare thing, a good modern narrative
poem.
Unfortunately, not all the poems are
up to these high standards: I cannot see
the slightest virtue in Judith Wright’s
embarrassingly selfconscious “Naked
Girl and Mirror,” nor in J. R. Row-
land’s “Lines for 18th February,” nor
Craig Powell’s feeble pseudo-canzone
“Rendezvous.” There are a number of
other poems so bad they should not
have seen print. I refrain from men-
tioning them.
QN the other hand, I was entertained
and impressed by one “European”
poet, A. D. Hope, with three excellent
poems, “The Martyrdom of St. Teresa”
(wryly funny as the best of Hardy),
“Advice to Young Ladies”- —a Graves-
like evocation of the classical past —and
“Ode on the Death of Pius the
Twelfth,” the latter an admirably
natural and philosophical tribute
to something more than a mere
occasion. A. D. Hope is certainly
one of those Australian poets whose
form and idiom are distinctly European-
American, and who deserves to be con-
sidered on the international as well as
the national level.
It is curious the number of very
empty poems here which are based on
classical themes: Vincent Buckley’s
“Versions from Catullus” (in old-
fashioned Ezra Pound-Robert Browning
banter —how very much inferior to Mr.
Couper!), Anne Gordon’s tremulous but
twee “Reading Dante,” David Row-
botham’s “The Hood” (with its modish
Aristotle epigraph), Thomas W. Shap-
cott’s meretricious pseudo-Lawrentian
"Irene as Coronis” with its quote from
"Greek myth.”
These are mistaken directions. A few
“European” poems —those of Chris
Wallace-Crabbe, Norman Talbot, Doug-
las Stewart, Grace Perry, Rosemary
Dobson —are competent and interesting,
but might have been written by any-
body with a flair for verse. They exhibit
the amateurism that afflicts most
anthologies of modern verse.
But on the whole this anthology does
poetry —not just Australian poetry —
proud.
I shall end with what is to me a
significant quotation from Robert D.
Fitzgerald’s “One Such Morning.”
. . . Yet, for enrichment, thought may
sometimes gaze
on happenings now stilled that half
persist
and origins that fade like ships in
mist.
Back to your origins, poets of Aus-
tralia!


The Primitive Banjo
By GEOFFREY SCOTT
The Banjo Of The Bush. Clement
Semmler. Lansdowne Press. $5.25.
Andrew barton paterson
was Australia’s pre-eminent
literary myth maker and, in the
face of the mystery why some myths
take root and flourish prodigiously and
others don’t, academic criticism seems
beside the point. The Man from Snowy
River, Clancy of the Overflow, and the
Jolly Swagman are now the archetypal
figures of Australian legend, the
Homeric heroes of a vanished age.
From the time when they first
appeared in THE BULLETIN in the
1880 s and ’9os, Banjo Paterson’s ballads
touched a nerve in the national con-
sciousness. Even in those days when
bullock teams still hauled the wool over
the western plains and it was possible
to address a letter simply “care of
Conroy’s sheep along the Castlereagh,”
there was a feeling that a primitive,
red-blooded, pioneering age was end-
ing.
“Temper democratic, bias offensively
Australian’ was how Furphy de-
scribed his rambling, broken-backed
epic “Such Is Life.” He might have
been describing THE BULLETIN itself,
which gave most of the new writers
their chance to break into print. Indeed
it is interesting to speculate how many
of them would have reached the public
at all but for the encouragement of
Archibald and A. G. Stephens. Pater-
son might have remained an unknown
solicitor, Lawson a mute inglorious
house-painter, and it is highly unlikely
that any other journals would have
wasted a second thought on Furphy’s
opus. But THE BULLETIN’S instinct
was sure. It was not enough to beat
the drum of Australian selfconscious-
ness; it was necessary to produce evi-
dence of a distinctively and peculiarly
native culture. The times and the oppor-
tunity produced the men and, of them
all, “The Banjo,” as he first signed
himself, was the most instantly popular.
The popularity has proved enduring.
As Clement Semmler remarks, we have
the phenomenon of a ballad-writer,
most of whose work was first published
more than 60 years ago, outselling every
contemporary poet year after year ever
since. Of the writers of Paterson’s own
age only Lawson rivals him in public
affection, but, though the best of Law-
son’s stories are far more moving and
sensitive than any of Paterson’s rhymes,
it is the Banjo’s characters who have
taken on the magic mantle of immor-
tality.
Clement Semmler’s book is the first
full-dress biography of Paterson. It
cannot have been a particularly easy
book to write, though the author’s
admiration for his subject as a man and
an artist comes through on every page,
and at times leads him into literary
assessments that seem to me over-gen-
erous. In a sense the past 30 years of
Paterson’s life were a long anti-climax,
for all his best work was done before
World War I and in fact most of it
by_the end of the 19th century. His
Boer War verses should be charitably
buried and Clement Semmler does him
no service by recalling some bathetic
and jingoistic examples. Paterson was-
an unmemorable war correspondent
and as editor of two Sydney news-
papers (“The Evening News” 1903-5
and “The Sportsman” 1921-30) he
made no noticeable impact on Austra-
lian journalism. He also produced sev-
eral novels, respectfully reviewed in
their day and now totally forgotten.
His obituary notices in 1941 surprised
many people who thought he had been
dead for years.
It is perhaps not Clement Semmler’s
fault that Paterson does not emerge
from his book as a particularly interest-
ing figure. He was, by all accounts,
an unaffected, genial, uncomplicated
character who had no grand ideas about
his writing and never seems to have
regarded himself as a “literary” man.
He loved the bush and its people (its
masculine people anyway, for women
make few and fleeting appearances in
his verse) and he had a passion for
horses, from the wiry mountain ponies
to the sleek thoroughbreds of the race-
track. Horses, in fact, are the real
heroes of many of his sagas. It was
the Horse from Snowy River that fas-
cinated him, as it was the horse that
carried Ryan to safety through Conroy’s
Gap, and Old Pardon, the Son of Re-
prieve, who galloped down all the
opposition despite his bellyful of green
feed.
Clement Semmler pays proper tribute
to Paterson’s enterprise in collecting
dozens of traditional outback ballads at
a time when many of them were already
Banjo Paterson
fast fading from memory. Paterson
admitted-that he did “a terrible lot of
patching and altering to make them
readable,” but publication of “Old
Bush Songs” in 1905 was a momentous
achievement and laid the foundation of
the energetic pursuit of folklore in
recent years. It is a chastening thought
that classics like “The Eumerella Shore”
and “The Old Bark Hut” might have
perished completely but for Paterson’s
devotion. A. G. Stephens once called
Paterson “the ordinary bush bard sub-
limated” and Banjo was quite content
to rate himself no higher than that.
There was, however, one marked
difference (apart from literary merit)
between the traditional bush ballad and
Paterson’s verses that they inspired. The
former were meant to be sung and
were generally strings of rough rhymes
set to existing English, Irish, or Scot-
tish melodies. Paterson’s ballads were
as typically recitation pieces as “Mar-
mion” or Macaulay’s Lays. Which
leads to the vexed question of “Waltz-
ing Matilda.” Was Paterson in fact
the author? I think that Clement
Semmler makes out a convincing case
that he was. The tune itself is another
and more mysterious matter, as readers
of Oscar Mendelsohn’s “A Waltz With-
Matilda” will have discovered.
Lion’s-gate
I shall go in, go in at the lion’s-gate
That locks the wildest garden. The man then
Who follows me in must be the beaten man,
Fellow-animal dragging in his wound,
Parting the bushes to his breathing-ground.
Thus driven, all who enter meet apart,
Hearing in the tunnels they make separate
The tawny suffering of the secret heart,
But in the hidings of the sheltering den
Sounds the sympathy that can save men;
There in the respite of leaf and dark they begin
On the long agony of curing wounds,
Ready to run again where the hunt resounds
On .the open rocks of the world. The beasts go in.

Our Nightmare Cities

OF these books it is perhaps slightly
odd that those dealing with
country life should be written
with more sophistication than the one
which is city-based. Both Jack Mc-
Clenaghan and D. E. Charlwood, I
feel, would write with skill and under-
statement about either city or country,
but it is interesting to note that they
have both selected the country as the
background for their books. Australians
and New Zealanders are still somewhat
selfconscious about their cities, as
though they cannot really believe that
they exist.
When one looks at the cities it is
easy enough to understand this incredu-
lity. Our major writers have only
scratched the surface of the unreal
asbestos-cement hell of Blacktown and
Villawood. They have only been able
to caricature it and etch it with hatred
from the outside. They have, not been
able to rise up from inside it and treat
it with that mixture of love, horror,
and amusement which may be extracted
by the hand of genius from all living
material. So the story of the child who
punched out confetti up at the back of
the classroom for all her schooldays,
carefully coloring each bit, remains un-
celebrated, as does the story of her
schoolmate who lovingly and patiently
sawed her desk in half over a period of
months.
Much Australian writing still dawdles
in a Georgian twilight, and we can
write with skill about the countryside,
but the city remains a nightmarish
excrescence on the landscape.
“Moving Target” is the first novel of
New Zealander Jack McClenaghan and
is a particularly fine achievement. It
is written with verve and economy.
It deals with a bushman and gold-
prospector who is called up by the Army
in World War 11. Dougherty, the pros-
pector, has no firmly held convictions,
he has no hesitation about killing when
his own survival is at stake, but he
continually runs foul of Army regula-
tions, and Army obsession with straight
hats. After being frequently disciplined
Dougherty unobtrusively deserts.
Dougherty slips away into the New
Zealand Alps, which he knows and loves
well, and begins a long and lonely
struggle with the authorities who hunt
him down, evading them with cunning
and ruthlessness. The landscape is a
presence throughout the book, with
lakes, forests, and treacherous rivers.
But the landscape for all its harshness
is an ally of Dougherty’s, and this is a
story of nature and natural man locked
in a convulsive struggle with unnatural
man, the world of regulations and
authoritarianism. Dougherty has no
false heroics and his deeds speak for
themselves. The incident in which he
sprinkles pepper in the eyes of the
murderous doberman pinscher dogs
and then attacks them with a scythe is
particularly fine. Some of the incidents
would seem a bit far-fetched if they were
told with less skill. However, Mc-
Clenaghan writes with such plainness
and understatement that he can make
any yarn feasible.
This is a novel which is strongly
written and with a good plot and atmos-
phere. Characterisation is adequate and
never jars, but is not outstanding. How-
ever, this is perhaps a carping criticism,
because in every other way the novel is
memorable, and achieves with remark-
able success its aim of exploring the
reactions of men in the grip of an
abstract situation.
“An Afternoon of Time” is a collec-
Patrick Davidson
tion of short stories and semi-
autobiographical pieces set in the far
west of Victoria’s western district.
These are quiet, reflective pieces
written with considerable skill and
sophistication of language, and also with
understatement. The landscape is again,
as in “The Moving Target,” a constant
presence. It is a hilly, heavily wooded,
and lonely landscape, similar in many
ways to the landscape which Mc-
Clenaghan writes of. These stories deal
with a variety of subjects: One is about
a cricket match, another is a character
sketch of “Percy the Rabitter,” another
deals with a wedding in the Irish style.
In these stories D. E. Charlwood is
more concerned in establishing a mood
than building up tension. The plot
is merely a light framework within
which he can evoke landscape or char-
acter or history. He is very much con-
cerned with continuity. The landscape
is history.
“I stood in the sunlight, aware of
the faintest sounds: the popping of
lucerne pods and the secretive move-
ments of the parrots in the apple trees;
the occasional fall of walnuts at the
foot of the orchard. There was not a
rabbit to be seen. ‘The rabbits are be-
coming a great pest,’ McAlister had
once written. ‘lt has been told me that
Thos. Austin brought them from Home
for the hunting, but he and the Colony
are fast regretting it.’ ”
The notable thing about Charlwood’s
stories is that we have here a country-
side which has known the white man
for a hundred-odd years. This is not
the rugged outback, this is country
which man has assimilated even if he
has not completely tamed it. Perhaps
the pick of these stories is the opening
story, “The Pilgrimage Year.” In it
Charlwood’s mixture of strength and
simplicity is displayed at its best.
“Make Much of Time” is a novel
by Patrick Davidson which .is Set in
Sydney. Mr. Davidson himself hails
from Belfast. The novel traces the love
affair of two teenagers which is tragic-
ally terminated, and then plots the
long and difficult return to normality
which this termination entails.
Some incidents are well evoked, par-
ticularly the scene in which the young
lovers undress to show each other their
bodies without actually touching. How-
ever, the book is too long and the author
allows what one presumes in his own
interest in collecting books, compara-
tive language, journalism, and general
philosophising to bog down the book.
There is an odd mixture of bookishness
and women’s magazine sentimentality.
The author also has the tendency to
use the same device too often. He
almost invariably describes in detail the
clothes that *his young heroes and hero-
ines are wearing. The three young girls
who appear in the book invariably use
the word “super” as their favorite
epithet. I know very few young women
who use this word. The characters are
always a bit too goody-goody. In fact,
the whole book is pervaded by a
strange sort of moralism. It is not
strict, hard and fast conventional mor-
ality, because the author seems to advo-
cate pre-marital sex where the parties
are deeply in love and going to marry.
But it is a morality of effort and
action, which is indicated by the title
“Make Much of Time.”
Through prose in her children’s
book “The River and the Road” Judith
Wright travels the road back to the
world of her earlier poetry explored in
such poems as that beautiful and nos-
talgic poem “Old House” or that justly
famous poem “Bullocky.”
In this book she evokes Australia in
1859, kettles hanging on chains from
old clay-and-stone chimneys, the big
purplish berries of the lilly pilly by the
river, a hurricane lantern carried by
hand through a stormy night, the bustle
of gold-rush days, and like a dark
counterpoint the memory of convict
days and old violence.
Max, Emily, and George are the


young heroes of the book. Max is
intelligent but has a lame foot. Emily
is sensitive and observant and George
is one of the boys. Max is friendly
with a young Aboriginal boy, Kulara.
The children play by the river, explore,
catch crayfish, and read. Max has his
foot treated by an old free-thinking
doctor. But strange things begin to
happen. George’s fishing line disappears
and a large knife also vanishes. A dark
figure moves around Iscanus House,
which is a large stone edifice, built by
convicts and set in remote bush on the
other side of the river. Iscanus House
is owned by a lonely old man who is a
retired magistrate, hated by the locals
for his meanness and his brutality to the
convicts in the old days.
The fine, sunlit day becomes a stormy
night and Max stumbles on a secret,
a murder which has been planned since
convict times. Briefly the dark counter-
point takes over and becomes the domi-
nant theme. However, eventually light
triumphs, although there are some
losses on the way. At the end of the
book the children are left with the
prospect of growing up. The road
leads on . . .
One of the problems of the artist is
to keep in touch with the sources of
his inspiration. Past a certain age
when the bloom has been rubbed off the
grape, it becomes more and more diffi-
cult to write with the direct sensuality
of youth, because one is no longer so
convinced of the importance of those
first lyric stirrings. Also everyone is
born with a certain environment. There
comes a point when the artist has
explored this in his work so completely
that it becomes impossible to traverse it
again. There are various ways in which
the artist may keep his imagination
alive. Yeats did it by recourse to myth
and had such nervous energy and
sensual vitality anyway that it was
impossible to shut him up. Edwin Muir
kept in contact with his subconscious
through his dreams. Walter de la Mare
used to write a lot of children’s poetry.
“The River and the Road” is a
charming and pleasant book, informed
by a gentle humanism. It has sufficient
plot and excitement to keep any child
of 12 or 13 or over interested, and the
Australian setting is handled with
imagination and sensitivity. It is, I feel,
important that Australian children
should be made to read literature with
an Australian background, as this all
helps to give the landscape history and
meaning, “a habitation and a name.”
This book perhaps lacks the lusty
vitality and humor that most very great
children’s books have, but it will cer-
tainly be a cherished addition to any
shelf of children’s books.
However, the book is probably not
written merely as - a children’s book,
and is, I suspect, written with the
ulterior purpose in mind of providing
a watershed for the poet’s imagination.
A book such as this is partly an exer-
cise, a means for releasing the poet’s
creative forces. I do not know whether
Judith Wright has ever tried writing
children’s poetry, but if she did the
results could be most interesting.
The Youngest Generation
By RODNEY HALL
Under Twenty-five. Edited by Anne
O’Donovan, Jayne Sanderson, and
Shane Porteous. Jacaranda. $3.95.
THIS handsome book is written,
illustrated, edited, and designed by
Australians under 25. The contri-
butors are very mixed: beginners side
by side with professional journalists
(one of whom claims to have written
a hundred million words), and children
of 12 and 15 among young adults of all
ages up to the magical 25.
As a whole, the book’s interest is a
matter of potential rather than achieve-
ment; indeed the editors make a some-
what self-important claim that, “In
these pages lies the future of our cul-
ture.” That’s further than most men
would dare go, for—who can tell?—
five years from now our national litera-
ture might well include the works of
Whitman, Hemingway, and Salinger.
Age-limits are unfortunately arbitrary,
in any case.
This book has a good deal to offer;
nevertheless, it gives curiously little
flavor of any overall individuality.
There’s a sense of aimlessness about it
(which may well be a true reflection of
the state of under 25 at present, but
let’s hope not). There seems little evi-
dence here of young writers attempting
to establish a new order or to break
down the old. There is almost no
iconoclasm; the book contains 63 con-
tributions, of which only three are
satirical.
Despite some sound work, I feel there
is a general lack of bite and adven-
turousness. This is no doubt because
adolescence is not usually a period of
extrovert experiment (as childhqpd
most definitely is), but of preoccupation
with self and the massive issues of
becoming adult. In the main, these are
writers entering a new world rather
than exploring the old. And prospective
readers should be warned not to expect
springtime bubbling over, the fresh-
ness of youth, etcetera. The accent in
“Under Twenty-Five” is on death, old
age, insanity, and suicide—all in the
necessary process of learning the limits
to which morbidity can be carried. The
self-absorption and the rejection of
flippancy in Susan Hemphill’s excellent
story “Elizabeth Anne” are quite
general attitudes: “I said I was sick
of the life of comedy that I’d been
leading, and that I wanted tragedy and
to be serious.” The craving for freedom
from parental control and social form-
alities makes a frequent appearance:
I want to be alone with
myself
For when I am alone I am myself
alone.
(“I am Alone,” by Jeannette Goudie.)
Youthful paradoxes permeate “Under
Twenty-Five”: the desire to be alone
matched by fear of being left without
support; the attempt to avoid medio-
crity which so often reveals mediocrity;
and the awareness of being young,
coupled with a panicky feeling that
it’s already getting too late to make a
mark in the world.
A s 1 see it, there are two outstanding
prose items, both extracts from
novels. The first, “Contacts,” by Peter
Carey, is a highly polished account of
lovemaking, in which the narration is
shared between the two participants. The
second, Suzanne Holly Jones’ “Harry’s
Child,” is all too short—an enticing
snippet of sophisticated writing. Both
Mr. Carey and Miss Jones have
achieved fully individual voices. “Prob-
balinggo,” by Peter Smart, is a fine
piece of reportage. Anyone who has
hitch-hiked in remote parts will recog-
nise the veracity of this account of
travelling in Indonesia; the style is
mature.
Most of the other stories are con-
cerned with presenting a quick succes-
sion of events. They are almost caution-
ary tales or fables (as with “Once
Upon a Time,” by B. D. O’Loghlin).
The result is curious but interesting.
The names are seldom filled out inta
personalities. It is as if one overhears
conversations and is left to guess, by
their ideas and tone of voice, what
the speakers are like.
One of the exceptions to this gen-
eralisation is Eileen Haley’s “Marcel-
lin,” a charming story of twins, in
which it is the events that are passed
over cursorily, as external machinery
for bringing about changes in the per-
sonality of the narrator and her brother.
Equally unusual is the disillusioned
violence of “Snookered,” by David Page,
and of Kenneth Ellis’ story “A Swim-
mer’s Christmas.” The latter tells of
a lifesaver who, hearing a drunkard
shout from the waves beyond the sand-
bar,. swims out toward him in a leis-
urely manner. When he realises the
man was being attacked by a shark
and that he is too late to help, the writ-
ing achieves an effective peak of tension.
and shock.
The best of the satirical pieces is a
savage and well-aimed attack on a
socially entrenched class: junior execu-
tives, and the offspring of politicians,
lawyers, and doctors. Here, in “Sing
This At Your Old School Reunion,”
John Box shows abundant talent. All
strength to him.
It is even harder for the reviewer to-
generalise about the poetry than about
the prose in “Under Twenty-Five.” The
outstanding work comes from three
contributors, Rhyll McMaster, Roger
McDonald, and Judith Driscoll. Miss

MELBOURNE UNIVERSITY PRESS
McMaster gives a delightfully sharp
and neat description of blue jays:
When they land
Their wings fold over,
Clip, snack . . .
Roger McDonald’s poem “Motherless
Children” also shows original responses
at work:
The flat-voiced priest
Has called a hundred times
With consolation in his acid palm . . .
Judith Driscoll’s technique is often
shaky, but a genuine power forces itself
through in “Spring and the Unborn
Child.” There are competent poems by
John E. Tranter, Jennifer Clarkson, and
David Wood, and a most attractive
piece called “Lady,” by David Walker.
Other poems have plenty to offer,
though they may lack assurance: the
strong “Blues,” by a New Guinean girl,
Rosa (one wonders why she has not
been accorded the courtesy of a sur-
name), the image a “chorus of port-
holes” in Kenneth Ellis’ poems about
a wrecked ship, and the vigor of “Song
of Clinton Steele,” by Brendan Pascoe.
Mr. Pascoe’s work is interesting; it’s
untidy, over-long, and poorly written.
But, for all this, the talent is clearly
there. As yet he seems to have been
unable to find the right language for
his thoughts. That is to say, the thoughts
themselves have not been clarified and
cut free from “poetic” jargon.
I expected to find much more work
of this untutored kind in the book, but
most of the contributors are dauntingly
suave. This might be explained by the
high proportion of university students
included—victims of literary awareness
and taste which have outstripped the
development of creative powers.
“Under Twenty-Five” contains some
workmanlike illustrations and some ex-
cellent photographs (particularly the
“Onlooker at Sydney Domain,” by Jon
McNally, and the second of the series
on the sculptor Peter Corlette, by Jon
van Gaalen).
Brief biographical notes are provided
on all those represented, but the snap-
shots of them are infuriatingly jumbled
and no clue is given as to which is
which. Still, by and large, the book is
well designed with generous-sized pages
and wide margins. It’s as pleasing to
handle as it is to read.
An Exile in Rome
By LEONIE KRAMER
A Long Way From Home. Desmond
O’Grady. F. W. Cheshire. $3.
Summer’s Tales 3. Edited by John
Iggulden. Macmillan. $3.
Desmond o’grady now quali-
fies as an expatriate writer, and
it is not surprising that his col-
lection of short stories should celebrate,
if that is the word, the trials and
errors of the stranger in a strange
land. In “A Long Way from Home”
he introduces Europeans in Australia
and Australians in Italy, and is able
to suggest their feeling of displacement
from their old environment and aliena-
tion from their new. In so doing he is
contributing to the tradition, well
established in Australian writing, of
the divided consciousness, the clash be-
tween settled habits and strange experi-
ences.
To describe his stories in this way,
however, is perhaps to imply a slight
solemnity which they certainly do not
possess. Their characteristic mode is
comedy, ranging from the near-farce of
Doctor Deju’s encounter with a devilish
goat on the cliff above Manly and a
Hungarian’s self-interested passion for
Billy Graham, to the cold humor of a
young Australian writer’s growing dis-
illusionment with Rome. In spite of
the variety in situation and character
which the stories display, they have in
common a narrative tone which can
perhaps best be described as quizzical
detachment—a distant' curiosity about
the oddities of human behaviour.
Mr. O’Grady has a sharp eye for the
odd and eccentric, and is at his best
when describing the antics of Doctor
Deju, or of a Croatian restaurant pro-
prietor conducting a feud with his
Serbian rival, or of an' Irish-Australian
grandfather escaping the steady surveil-
lance of his wife to go on a beery spree
at carnival time. He is less successful
when, occasionally, he strikes a more
serious note, or tries to explore a close
personal relationship. Here, in a minor
key, he seems ill at ease and unable
to make the surface reflect the shadows
beneath.
The role of the cool, detached ob-
server of the human comedy is not
fully sustained and one is at liberty
to wonder whether in his Roman exile
Mr. O’Grady is not feeling slightly
sentimental about Australians. They, as
well as his Europeans, are figures of
fun. Their gaucheries and prejudices
are revealed, as are the temperamen-
tal peculiarities of bewildered Euro-
peans in Australia. Yet he extends to
them an affectionate sympathy which
does not always show in his treat-
ment of Europeans. They may be stupid,
narrow - minded, isolationist, and
maddeningly self-contained, but they
are good blokes all the same. One can-
not be so sure about many of . his
Europeans. Even here, however, there
are qualifications to be made. One
thinks of his entertainingly satirical
portrait of a pretentious young Aus-
tralian artist in Rome, and of his less
successful sketch of a rich Australian
girl who has been to all the right
places and learnt nothing from them.
There is no single outstanding story in
this collection, and there are one or
two which barely earn their place; but
there are many good moments.
'JHE same cannot be said of “Summer’s
Tales 3.” Its predecessor was,
in my opinion, an unsatisfactory
collection, in spite of the interest attach-
ing to the fact that it was made up, as
is his volume, of hitherto unpublished
material. Mr. Iggulden hopes that his
anthology might some day be seen to
mark “a stage and direction of transi-
tion which later was realised to be of
some importance to Australian writ-
ing.” At the risk of appearing unduly
pessimistic, I must say that I think his
optimism is misplaced. He notes that
these writers have in common “the
quality of directness” and the “unpre-
tentious qualities of clear communica-
tion of recognisable human realities and
experienced human situations which are
utterly basic in making a work of
fiction readable . . .” It may be so.
To claim that it is, however, is to ignore
the vast differences between writers
such as Manning Clark and D’Arcy
Niland, G. M. Glaskin and Dorothy
Hewett, Peter Cowan and James Mead.
The qualities of clarity and directness
are important, though not overridingly
so. That they are no guarantee of dis-
tinction, this anthology clearly demon-
strates.
There are . some worthwhile things
in it—Peter Cowan’s small “drama,”
Manning Clark’s ruminative mono-
logue, G. M. Glaskin’s tightly con-
trolled “chiller”; and other stories, less
satisfying as wholes, have moments of
interest. But the successes do not cancel
out the effect of sheer mediocrity—
mediocrity in sentiment, in situation,
in grasp of character, in style.

On Privilege
By the Hon. W. F. SHEAHAN, MLA
Parliamentary Privilege in Australia.
Enid Campbell. Melbourne Univer-
sity Press. $6.00.
IT is not uncharitable to say that few,
if any, members of Parliament
possess any profound knowledge of
Parliamentary Law or privilege. Pro-
fessor Campbell’s book is a first-class
textbook on the subject. It embraces
in its ten chapters, with abbreviations,
notes, table of cases, table of statutes
and index, a comprehensive treatise of
Parliamentary Law in all its ramifica-
tions.
She shows that the English Parlia-
ment began, not as a political or legis-
lative institution, but as a Court of
Justice, whereas the Colonies and
Dominions were the creation of a de-
veloped political institution, viz., the
House of Commons. Her clear exposi J
tion of the contest for supremacy be-
tween the King and Parliament high-
lights how the latter, asserting those
rights which became the dominant
issue in the struggle, succeeded. She
shows why Parliament demanded that
it and it alone was to be the sole
interpreter and judge of its privileges.
The Professor has also made it clear
that Parliamentary Privilege, particu-
larly in New South Wales, differs from
in the Commonwealth, which gains its
power of privilege, and those of punish-
ment incidental to its exercise, through
the operation of Section 49 of the Com-
monwealth Constitution Act. The
Commonwealth has power to punish
contempt, but the New South Wales
Parliament has not that power. In 1842,
the then Chief Justice, Sir Francis
Forbes, refused to call in question the
proceedings of Parliament, holding that,
even though a breach of privilege had
been committed, there was no penalty
enforcible for the alleged contempt.
Professor Campbell’s book, reviewing
the classic case of Browne and Fitz-
patrick, poses the question what safe-
guards should there be so that a person
charged shall receive a fair and im-
partial hearing. Should he have the
right to know in advance the specific
particulars of the charge? Should the
House have the right to regard any
conduct as a contempt? Is a Com-
mittee of Privileges the safest guarantee
of preserving freedom of expression,
whether editorial opinion or public
declaration, with a corresponding
respect for the dignity of Parliament?
The Professor does not express an
opinion whether the public interest is
best served by referring questions of
privilege to a Committee, when a prima
facie case has been established, but a
study of her book will help Parliamen-
tarians to form a balanced judgment
whether this would be preferable to a
sudden decision of an Assembly, based
on party expediency and passion.
Every member of Parliament should
possess a copy of this book.


BUSINESS AND FINANCE
Safeguards—Nil!
THE Common Market threat has once again become
serious. This time it is not just another “crying wolf”
episode; this time it looks like the real thing. It is
“more likely than not,” according to Canberra’s present
assessment of the latest Wilson Government moves, that
Britain will go into the Common Market. And it will be
quite soon, according to this view, probably within a year.
But while the Canberra men think the old General is no
longer the “obstacle formidable” of a year or so ago (and the
uncertain political situation in Germany may make the
British seem a more attractive partner after all), there is no
suggestion that things will be made easy or rules will be
broken for Britain.
Mr. McEwen said in June that he believed Britain would
join the Common Market in a matter of years rather than
months. He would not put it quite that way now. Britain’s
entry looks much closer with Mr. Wilson now a dedicated
marketeer and the Foreign Minister, Mr. George Brown,
off on a sounding-out tour of Europe.
Reaction here has been blase, in extraordinary contrast
to the excitement of 1962 when Mr. McEwen went around
crying woe and had Mr. Bury sacked for being insufficiently
alarmist. Of course we do have assurances that “Common-
wealth interests will be safeguarded.” But like assurances
that Britain will maintain a “military presence” east of Suez,
they are of doubtful value. The London “Economist” has
gone as far as to say that Mr. Wilson reiterates this condi-
tion of Britain’s entry solely in order to give himself room
for bargaining manoeuvres. He might decide for other
reasons that he didn’t want to take his country in and he
could invoke the name of the Commonwealth and use the
old Empire bank to stave off his critics. (The “Economist’s”
detailed examination of the question is on page 67 of this
issue of THE BULLETIN.)
Officials of the Department of Trade and Industry are
under no illusions about the likelihood of Commonwealth
interests being safeguarded if Britain joins the EEC. They
say that it is difficult to see just how Britain could negotiate
to safeguard these interests. The “Brits” would go in under
the Treaty of Rome, and that does not allow scope for any
special arrangements. But if they are pessimistic on that
account, they are probably being sensibly realistic. From
having preferences and even free access, our wheat, meats,
sugar, dairy produce, and vine products will change to
facing severe discrimination in relation to the produce of
the Six. They hope not for safeguards but for a moderation
of the Market’s ultra-protectionist agricultural policies. They
hope, first, that a Britain inside might be a force for modera-
tion and, second, that the Kennedy Round talks will get
tariff walls cut down somewhat.
Mr. McEwen has been positively eloquent—and he is not
often that—about the great importance of the Kennedy
Round succeeding and the dangers of a lapse into economic
nationalism and regionalism in which we might be left out
in the cold. But, unfortunately, he has been unable to con-
tribute significantly to the success of the talks by offering
reciprocal concessions. In the bad old tradition, our negotia-
tors have been insisting on the sacrosanct nature of our
tariffs on industrial goods. No one would seriously maintain
that we could make or break the talks, but we should not
underrate our own importance. We are a sizable market
for industrial goods. A new liberal stance on our part im
MEN AND MATTERS
LAST week was the first time in
many years that Mr. James Burns
had not chaired Burns Philp’s
annual meeting. But the octogenarian
chairman’s temporary indisposition that
kept him in Bowral for the day gave
83-year-old Mr. Frederick Ewen Lox-
ton the chance to chair the meeting
as his last official duty before retiring
from a board on which he had sat
for 36 years and from a company he
had served for 66 years.
When Mr. Loxton joined Burns
Philp as a 17-year-old lad in Sydney
16 years after its foundation, the com-
pany had a capital of £235,000. Today
it stretches from Wagga Wagga to
Pago Pago, its capital is slBm., and
total shareholders’ funds $74.7m.
In 1906, the 23-year-old Neutral
Bay boy, by then an evening student
Arts graduate from Sydney University,
was sent to Queensland, and he has
been there ever since. After being
manager of several Queensland
branches, and general manager of the
State of Queensland from 1924, he led
Burns Philp’s major move into retailing
in 1932 by founding Penneys, which
grew to an extensive chain, where em-
ployees used to call him the store detec-
tive, he watched the stocks so carefully.
In the northern State, Penneys was
bigger than Woolworths or G. J. Coles,
but Burns Philp directors, recognising
that Mr. Loxton would not be avail-
able to run the
chain for ever,
agreed to sell it off
to Coles in 1957
at a handsome
profit.
Outside the old
firm, Mr. Loxton
had time for other
interests; he de-
came deputy
chairman of the
National Bank of
Australasia. H e
was also a director of the infant airline
Q.A.N.T.A.S. from 1930 to 1947.
AT another annual meeting last
week, the chairman’s absence
meant a 24-year pattern was
broken for Tutt Bryant Ltd., the Syd-
ney-based construction equipment com-
pany. The joint managing directors,
Mr. Leo Tutt and Mr. George
Bryant, take it in turns to be chair-
man. It was Mr. Bryant’s turn to pre-
side last week. But he was in London
on business, so Mr. Tutt had to take
the chair for the second year running.
These two men have been partners
in this company since 1940 when Mr.
Tutt, who had the Le Tourneau fran-r
chise in those days, invited his best
customer, George Bryant, to join him
in financing the addition of an Allis
L. E. Tutt
James Burns
G. E. Bryant
Chalmers dealership to L. Tutt and
Co. and jointly managing the com-
pany. They have worked together full
time in this business ever since
apart from some time spent on outside
interests, many of which are jointly
owned.
Together they own one of Australia’s.:
leading Brahmin cattle studs, Tropical
Cattle Co., and are spending $600,000
improving a large area of wallum.
land at Caloundra, in Queensland.
George Bryant is quite a different
man to Leo Tutt. Tutt had battled up-
the ladder, starting as a salesman and
later becoming manager of Waugh and
Josephson before starting out on hi&
own in 1938; Bryant was from a well-off
family, did an engineering degree at
Sydney University, and has considerable
family interests outside Tutt Bryant
(like Bell Bryant).


offering to reconsider our industrial tariff policies might make
a considerable contribution to a breakthrough on agricultural
protection.
“Industrial diversification” sounds very nice as an aim of
tariff policy, but in reality it is folly. It means the creation
of a whole set of internationally non-competitive industries,
handicapped by a small domestic market and detrimental to
overall national efficiency. We need to arrange time for any
adjustments. But we cannot seriously expect the Europeans
to make drastic adjustments in their farm policies unless we
are prepared to make some ourselves.
Budging the Consumer
THERE is plenty of money around; most company bor-
rowings (with one or two spectacular exceptions like
last week’s 78 percent undersubscription by Olympic)
and Commonwealth loans are being fully (or over) sub-
scribed; overdraft limits by the trading banks have reached
record levels; new lending commitments of the trading banks
rose in November by $29 million a week or 50 percent
more than their old “guidelines” rate; and now the Reserve
Bank is handing back another $25 million out of the banks’
Statutory Reserve Deposits as a contribution toward a $4O
million rise in term loans by the banks.
On top of that, the Reserve Bank has been helping official
interest rates downward by edging bond prices up through
being a reluctant seller of short and medium bonds to
those professional operators and investors who are now keen
to buy in the hope of showing a capital profit when the next
Commonwealth loan rates are approved.
Yet despite all this, the economy is still flat; experts like
Sir lan Potter are still saying that “the present economic
outlook justifies a conscious effort to stimulate private activity
to a new level of productivity” and the Federal president
of the Associated Chambers of Manufactures, Mr. F. R.
Curtis, has called for urgent Government action to stimu-
late growth. But, as Peter Samuel says on page 65, the
Treasury in Canberra seems fairly pleased with things the
way they are.
No matter how useful all these monetary measures are
for industry and commerce, the consumer still must be
encouraged to spend some of the cash he is now saving if
the whole economic structure is to keep moving ahead.
For most of the potential buyers of the appliances and
vehicles who have saved a proportion of the cost do not
have enough to pay for their purchase entirely in cash. And
unless the outlook appears fair to them, these people are
not going to be willing to go into debt.
A Broker's Education
DESPITE the significant improvements in recent years
(with a four-year certificate course now available at
the Sydney Technical College, for example, presented
by lecturers supplied by the - Stock Exchange), the require-
ments of formal training for stockbrokers in Australia still
lag far behind Britain’s.
There, the Federation of Stock Exchanges has come out
with a set of examination statutes that would do credit
to a university. They bear in mind that “a stockbroker has
to give advice to the public.” So, as from August 4, 1970,
to be allowed to be a new partner in a firm of brokers you
will have to have passed six three-hour papers in: law,
monetary economics, taxation, Stock Exchange practice,
interpretation of company reports and accounts, and the
technique of investment. This last will test the applicant’s
ability to give investment advice: the phrase still favored
by brokers “Charlie (or Fred or George) is buying, so
you’d better get a few now” will probably not collect many
marks.
Because there is a three-year apprenticeship period,
anyone who joins a British member firm as a trainee after
next August will have to qualify as a trainee. For even to be
allowed to train, potential brokers will have to be qualified
in some way.
THE WEEK BRIEFLY
For the economy: The trading banks’ credit
facilities are further improved by the Reserve Bank
allowing another $4O million to go into their Term
Loans Fund, bringing this to $287 million. Of the in-
crease, $25 million moves from Statutory Reserve
Deposits and $l5 million comes from trading bank assets
before the end of December ... In the four weeks to
November 9, the banks’ overdraft lending averaged $27.1
million a week, against $24.9 million over the previous
four-week period and $19.4 million in the corresponding
1965 interval.
Portion of the Commonwealth’s last cash loan has
been used to repay $U.5.19.8 million of securities
matured in New York on December 1; the Treasurer is
“exploring the possibilities” of a new overseas loan.
October’s retail sales totalled $562.8 million, only
$4.8 million more than September’s; the September-
October advance in 1965 was $14.9 million. Retailers
still anticipate record Christmas spending . . . Tobacco
consumption for 1964-65 averaged 5.271 b. a head, down
from 5.351 b. in 1963-64.
The Housing Loans Insurance Corporation insured
2284 loans up to November 25, for a total $lB million
. . . “Current market values” will form the basis of car
insurance by members of the Fire and Accident Under-
writers’ Association from February 1 next.
The current wheat harvest may permit a contribution
to the Wheat Stabilisation Fund the first since the
Fund’s exhaustion in 1958-59 . . . Beef and veal produc-
tion in the September quarter rose on lower slaughter-
ings.
For the markets: Digestion of the Federal elec-
tion results certainly enabled Australian share markets
to feel more assured; they were further aided by the
Reserve Bank’s policy on the Term Loans Fund. The
better tone held over all five trading days, so the index
at last managed to stay up. Not much help arrives from
the leaders, but other good industrials are receiving more
attention. Base metals again look strong.
Higher gold and dollar reserves for November brought
some encouragement to London. However, buyers tend
to remain hyper-cautious as they await a decision on
Rhodesia. ... A few glamor issues stirred Wall Street
from stagnancy, but could not overcome a generally
dull approach.
For companies: The “big ’uns” left a variable
impress on the week . . . British Tobacco, though,
started things off well by confirming a 12 percent
dividend by its final six percent, having last paid this
full rate in 1927. The parent profit for 1965-66 was
announced as nine percent higher at $4,837,178 . . .
CSR is to close its asbestos mining venture at Wit-
tenoom (W.A.), having shown losses there since 1963
and now needing a $3 million asset write-down; in
23 years the mine has yielded 161,000 tons of blue
asbestos . . . Burns Philp finds conditions still buoyant
in Papua-New Guinea, yet drought and lower sugar
prices still influence trading in N.S.W. and Queensland
. . . The four months to October 31 produced lower
sales and pre-tax profits for Felt and Textiles of Aus-
tralia, whose directors had to face a rather critical
annual meeting . . . An $8 million unsecured notes
issue from Olympic Consolidated Industries could only
attract $ 1,756,900; underwriters will make up the
balance . . . Group profit of AWA went up 3.4 percent
to $1,779,073 on much lower tax; the 16 percent dividend
including six percent bonus, is untouched.
Widely diversified heavy and light engineer Clyde
Industries suffered a 21 percent fall in earnings to
$1,377,224, fetching earning rate down from 23.6 to
18.4 percent; most of the damage occurred in the second
half, yet dividend remains at 15 percent. Subsidiary

PETER SAMUEL'S CANBERRA
A Treasury Point of View
How strong is the economy?
TREASURY officials are reacting to
the current ferment of agitation for
action to stimulate the economy.
They strongly contest the need for any
such action. First, they say that un-
employment has remained very steady
throughout this year, showing no signs
of increase. So, despite all the talk of
a lack of buoyancy in the economy,
all additions to the work force have
been absorbed into employment. This,
together with the time during which
unemployment has remained steady,
shows that business is unlikely to be
hoarding labor. If there had been any
such hoarding, there would by now have
been signs of layoffs.
Next, they say that the expansionary
effect of the August Budget is still
largely in the future and they are con-
fident that by early next year it will be
seen that the economy needs no boosts.
They are also reconciled to the States
getting small, but important, new grants
of money after the special meeting with
the Premiers in the new year, and the
Federal election promises will soon
begin to cost money. So there will be
some automatic boost.
They say that action now is unneces-
sary and that it is best to wait until
early February. Only by then will the
effect of the Budget be clear and also
it will be possible to judge the strength
of consumer spending over the
Christmas period and see how school-
leavers’ have been absorbed into employ-
ment. Any decisions to boost or not to
boost will be based on better informa-
tion about trends than is available now.
Treasury people also say that there
is little scope for stimulating the econ-
omy through monetary measures.
Money is so freely available now that
anyone who wants to spend is not being
inhibited from doing so through lack
of finance.
That is a Treasury view. (There is
rarely such a thing as a Treasury view.)
We could argue with it, but for now it
is, perhaps, enough to note that the
Treasury has been over-optimistic or
complacent about the strength of the
economy before. October’s retail sales
figures were a disappointing relapse
from the September level. They are a
poor start to the Christmas economy,
but November and December will still
provide scope for seasonal cheer. We’ll
hope so, anyway.
ON the fifth anniversary of the
founding of the OECD (Organisa-
tion for Economic Co-operation
and Development) it is worth remarking
again that Australia suffers through non-
membership. The OECD is described
by the Secretary-General, Thorkil Kris-
tensen, as “the organisation of Western
countries,” and the claim is difficult to
contest. We recently joined the Organi-
Ration’s Development Assistance Com-
mittee and earned ourselves some blue
cross-hatching on the cover of the latest
“OECD Observer,” but we missed out
on a lot by not being eligible for the
full blue shading by becoming a full
member.
The OECD produces an impressive
flow of studies of continuing economic
problems, national and international. Its
various committees meet around the
year and a handful of ad hoc surveys
are underway at any one time. It is
rapidly becoming an umbrella organisa-
tion within which the big issues of the
IMF, GATT, UNCTAD, the Group of
Ten, and the World Bank are thrashed
out. Our continued absence from the
organisation is an extraordinary act of
isolationism.

MICHAEL BAUME'S SYDNEY
Keeping It in the Family
FAMILY fights are always the best.
Not even the confusion of a
Landmark lark, the determina-
tion of a Clementson comeback, the
expected crossfire at Concrete Indus-
tries now that two men formerly asso-
ciated with the horrible Hurstville
super-centre project (in receivership)
are challenging for a board seat, can
compare with the violence of a family
fight.
There is an added piquancy about the
heckling at Hudsons (even though this
year the dissident nephew, Dr. George
Hudson, did not stand for the board),
the annual shindig between the
Mackens and the Foys at Mark Foys,
the walloping at Wallaces, and the
battle between the Henderson family
about who will sit on the board of their
spring-making company.
But the best of them all this year is
a renewal of a battle that began six
years ago between the McWilliam
brothers over their rich Sydney print-
ing company, William Brooks and Co.
Ltd. For this is one family fight
where major matters of principle are
involved, not just family feelings, and
where the field of battle has long since
left the board room, has departed even
from the annual meeting, has gone
through the courts and is now before
the Government.
Messrs P. B. and B. S. McWilliam,
sons of a former director of William
Brooks, Mr. Bruce McWilliam, have
formally asked the N.S.W. Government
to appoint an inspector under Section
186 of the Companies Act, “or to exer-
cise any other power that you may
have” to stop the present takeover
scheme for the company from being
implemented. So far no decision has
been made on the request.
The takeover offer now before share-
holders is of $8 cash for every $2
ordinary share, $6 for every cumulative
participating preference share and $2
cash for first preference shares, and has
been made by William Brooks (Hold-
ings) Ltd., a company founded by
William Brooks’ managing director, Mr.
R. A. McWilliam. The offer is worth
$616,000, but Mr. Bruce McWilliam
says he has another buyer for the
company for “$2 million or so,” and
there is no doubt about the financial
strength of this potential buyer.
The reason his sons, both share-
holders, have asked for an urgent official
investigation before the takeover goes
through is that they consider the take-
over arrangement unfair because the
company is being sold to the managing
director’s private company for only one
third of what Mr. Bruce McWilliam
considers to be its real value. But
holders of most of the 100,000 shares
in the company have agreed to accept
the offer; the R. A. McWilliam group
announced 90 percent acceptance only
two weeks after making the original
notice of intention to make a bid at the
end of October.
Mr. Bruce McWilliam’s reply to this
is that 80,000 of the 100,000 shares in
the company are owned by employee-
shareholders, most of whom have been
lent money by the company or given
bonuses in order to buy these, shares,
and that another 15,000 shares are held
by the R. A. McWilliam family. He
suggests that the employee-shareholders
are not really free agents in their de-
cisions what to do about the takeover
offer from their managing director, and
says further that about half these em-
ployee shares were acquired since the
1961 court action between the Mc-
Williams, when Mr. Bruce McWilliam
succeeded in getting a Supreme Court
order to wind the company up (later
set aside by consent in the High Court).
]J/£R. JUSTICE HARDIE had made
the wind-up order because he was
“satisfied directors have been acting in
their own interests rather than the
interests of members of the company as
a whole.” He was also satisfied that the
managing director, Mr. Ronald Arthur
McWilliam, had acted in a manner
“unfair and unjust” to other members
of the company. In that action, Mr.
Bruce McWilliam had argued that the
company had taken actions that would
deliberately depress the market value
of the shares, with the intention of keep-
ing control of the company, by writing
down the valpe of the assets below
market value, suppressing profits, and
paying extravagant wages and bonuses
(some of which went into buying the
company’s shares).
Mr. R. A. McWilliam said that all
this was part of his intention of creat-
ing a “worker-owned” company; but
now Mr. McWilliam’s proprietary com-
pany will end up owning the shares.
William Brooks has the Sydney tele-
phone book contract, which, according
to Mr. Bruce McWilliam, brings in far
more profit that the company reveals,
as well as having a considerable general
printing operation.


BEHIND THE MOVE INTO EUROPE
"The Economist" looks at Britain and the E.E.C.
THE convolutions of some of his
statements should not obscure the
seriousness of Mr. Wilson’s de-
sire to bring Britain into Europe. The
key question is: if General de Gaulle
does not impose a veto, would Mr. Wil-
son press on eagerly into the market,
even if no special economic arrange-
ments were offered to “safeguard the
essential British and Commonwealth in-
terests” of which he talks. The short
answer is: “yes, although Mr. Wilson
will deny this.” His denial is not
only based on his desire to maintain a
bargaining, position on certain peri-
pheral economic matters if he can. He
is also intent on maintaining political
dignity at home, in case President de
Gaulle slams the door in his face.
In his coming talks about talks, Mr.
Wilson may therefore mutter some
things about food prices and other
special interests, possibly giving the im-
pression even to some of Britain’s
friends in Europe that he is a pettifog-
ging man. But it will be quite wrong
to deduce from this that he is asking
for entry on impossible conditions,
which is a hypocrite’s way of saying
“keep me out.” Really, he is heaven-
bent on joining, provided only that
the Sphinx of Paris does not say “non.”
What is true, however, is that the
Government seems to have worked
out only sketchily the economic in-
terests that it would be nice to safe-
guard in the negotiations if Britain can,
and is in that sense in danger of per-
petrating a botched job.
LET it therefore be said straight-
away that it really is not a major
obstacle that a switch to the com-
mon market’s agricultural policy might
raise Britain’s cost of living by between
and percent, over a number of
years; many other, much lesser, policies
of successive governments have man-
aged to change the cost of living by far
more than that. Nor, in the context of
this historic venture, is it really a mat-
ter of quite overwhelming importance
that the common market’s agricultural
policy might eventually swell Britain’s
import bill by between £175 and £2OO
million per annum; that is equal to
something under 3 percent of Britain’s
total exports of goods and services in
any one year, and, of course, entry into
the market would affect our exports by
considerably more.
A lot of the worthy, impassioned talk
in 1962-63 about the need to protect
particular primary exports from the
Commonwealth to Britain also looks
pretty silly now, in view of the switch
of Commonwealth exports in the last
few years, especially those of Australasia
toward Japan. The most frequently
quoted, because harshest, case is that
of New Zealand’s agricultural exports
to Britain, about which the Europeans
themselves agree that something
should be done. But it is worth re-
membering, to keep things in perspec-
tive, that the number of New Zealand
farmers and workers directly engaged
in producing agricultural exports to
Britain and nobody suggests that
they would all be thrown out of a job
is probably less than the number
of people who have become newly un-
employed in Britain during the past two
months alone. The problem of com-
pensation arrangements is not exactly
vast.
The real economic problems are two-
fold. The first and short-term one
to which the British Government still
seems aggravatlngly blind concerns
sterling’s international role. The big
point to understand here is that the
near-equalisation of prices, and the
near-absolute freedom of movement, of
industrial goods in the common market
means that, as soon as the pace of in-
Britain's Changing Trade Pattern
1958 to 1965
Percentages show total growth 1958-65
Britain, exports f.o.b.; imports c.i.f.
ternal demand in one member country
gets even slightly out of step with that
in another, these countries swing into
large current balance of payments de-
ficits or surpluses.
For continental European countries
swings of this magnitude in their cur-
rent accounts are manageable
partly because movements in their capi-
tal accounts tend to go in the right
counter-cyclical direction (with more
foreign and domestic capital tending to
be invested at home when the country
is in boom and therefore deficit, more
being invested abroad when it is in
recession and therefore surplus). But
in Britain, with its world-wide invest-
ment role and the £3OOO million of
foreign short-term sterling balances that
are held here, everybody knows that a
current deficit tends to lead to a with-
drawal of capital from the country —•
piling a new Pelion of crisis on the
Ossa.
The usual British Treasury reply to
this is that, by the time Britain enters
Europe, our internal policy will have
seen to it that sterling rides high and
impregnable, as witness the very hearten-
ing October trade returns. But that
represents a complete misunderstand-
ing of the long-term problem; even if
internal redeployment in the British
economy went so marvellously far dur-
ing the current recession that sterling
became as strong a currency as the
D-mark has been in most recent years
(and it would not be good for other
countries if any single currency became
much stronger), then the problems in
off-years would remain.
There is very real reason to ques-
tion whether it is possible to operate
within a wide free trading community
without any tariff or other restric-
tions on trade between its members, and
with inviolable rules against imposing
such restrictions whenever the move-
ment of goods across these free ex-
changes turns even momentarily ad-
verse while still trying to act as one
of the world’s two leading short-term
bankers, committed to taking the strain
on our gold reserves whenever any
other currency in the world is regarded
as even temporarily more desirable to
hold than sterling. Since it is highly
desirable on every general economic
and technological ground that Britain
should merge itself into a wider free
trading community, it will be right to
accompany an attempt at entry by
thinking hard and concurrently about
ways in which Britain could modify its
international banking role.
QERTAINLY, if the continental
Europeans suggest any negotia-
tions about tolerable schemes for
funding the sterling balances, Britain
should consider them very carefully; at
present the British Treasury seems far
too inclined to assume that any mention
of this subject would merely be a wic-
ked and wounding gallic obstacle or
trick. Heretically, one might even ques-
tion whether as a pis aller (and how-
ever loudly the United States protes-
ted) Britain should not indicate in the
negotiations that it might as least con-
sider supporting stratospheric French
sugestions for so-called “solving of the
key currency problem” by the admitted
archaism of raising the world price of
gold.
Whether, if any scheme for reducing
the banking role of sterling were ham-
mered out, it would then be sensible
to consider a change in the sterling ex-


change rate relative to other currencies
should depend on how Britain’s exports
move in the year ahead. It may be that
the recession next year will show that,
once Britain is running its economy
with an unemployment rate higher than
the tiny level which is has been willing
to tolerate hitherto, then exports will
bound up. But if they do not, then the
problem will deserve to be studied quite
unemotionally.
The second major economic problem
about entering Europe in the long
term it will prove even more important
for us than sterling’s role is this:
entry into Europe would reduce
Britain’s freedom of independent
economic action, because Britain would
have gradually to integrate with Europe
many of its taxation policies, social
policies, planning policies, trade union
policies, and much else besides. Ten
years ago, it might have been right to
cite this as an obstacle, because there
were then still doubts whether the whole
of European Christian Democracy
could easily be converted to the modern
policies which most Britons will want to
pursue. Today, however, most European
policies and practices in most of these
fields are more progressive and efficient
than Britain’s are. That is shown by the
way in which their experiments have
worked.
Perhaps in only one major respect
does British planning policy enjoy an
advantage: the budget system in Britain
makes it possible to announce a
counter-cyclical change in tax rates on
a single parliamentary afternoon, to take
effect immediately. Fortunately, that is
an advantage which no rule in the
European Economic Community would
force Britain to give up. And, over-
shadowing all other aspects of integra-
tion, is the key point: it has become
steadily more apparent that the modern
technological industries, on which
Britain’s industrial future depends, need
a wider free market in which to operate
and grow than can be provided by the
population of 55 million and national
income of some £30,000 million of
Britain alone.
Tactics in Paris
BRITAIN’S second bid to enter the
European community has been
diligently played down in Paris.
The foreign minister, M. Couve de
Murville, has been telling journalists
that Britain must drop its east of Suez
commitments and that the pound, sterl-
ing must cease to be a reserve cur-
rency. The Labor Government, in
the French view, is even less indepen-
dent of Washington than was its Con-
servative predecessor and as such it is
not “ripe” for Europe. The practical
problem is how to block the British
initiative this second time round. First
of all, the French Government wants to
gain time; it must first get past the
parliamentary elections in March. An
abrupt political veto would be unpopu-
lar and would certainly be exploited by
the opposition. Objections to the trav-
elling timetables of Messrs. Wilson and
Brown can only delay matters for a
few weeks. To gain months, the French
negotiators will have to display their
old virtuosity once more. EFTA is no
longer a serious obstacle as in 1963,
but any discussion of special provisions
to cater for “Britain’s vital interests”
would give the French plenty of room
for manoeuvre.
Rightly or wrongly, it is believed in
Paris that Mr. Wilson will proceed
slowly and cautiously and that the sec-
ond British bid will only reach its cli-
max in mid-1968. By then, General
de Gaulle should know in what shape
the common market has emerged from
the Kennedy Round negotiations. He
should also know whether his original
policy of looking to Bonn, or his more
recent policy of looking toward Mos-
cow, is the more rewarding. On this
basis, he could decide in his own time
whether to wield the veto yet again.
Meanwhile, the French will rely on
Fabian tactics of obstruction.
£)NLY if Paris were taken by surprise
and Mr. Wilson and Mr. Brown
Were to go ahead with lightning speed
would General de Gaulle be forced to
change his tactics, if not his strategy.
Mr. Wilson’s only hope is at one and
the same time to press hard enough on
General de Gaulle to make him think
again and then, having softened him a
little, to attract him by his general
political and technological outlook. Can
this be done?
As far as pressure goes, Mr. Wilson
will not even begin to apply it unless
he simplifies Britain’s request to enter
the common market to the very mini-
mum. He must smooth it down so
thoroughly that the French negotiators
cannot get one of their famous half-
nelsons on it* while the Five are re-
assured that it really is the European
community Britain wants to enter and
not some new creation of London’s
fancy. That means a British decision
to accept the common market as it
stands, with only a transition period
sufficient to ensure that adjustment is
smooth and that the broadened com-
munity, including Britain, can handle
problems for Britain or the Common-
wealth as and if they arise. Any
attempt to refine on detail would doom
the attempt to failure from the start.
If, as some suggest, negotiations were
to begin after the end of the Kennedy
Round of world trade talks next sum-
mer, and then last, say, at least a year,
this would spell disaster. Mr. Wilson
talks of “momentum,” and he will have
to mean it if he is to make the most
of his resources.
If Mr. Wilson, at the end of his
projected grand tour with Mr. Brown,
decides there is no immediate prospect
of getting past General de Gaulle into
Europe, then he should settle down to
what “The Observer” has called the
“long siege” of the community, in the
hope of getting in eventually. If one
accepts that Britain needs to belong to
a wider free trading area and if we
dismiss some airy new talk of a north
Atlantic-cum-Pacific free trade area
(North America, EFTA, possibly
Japan, and Australasia) as the moon-
shine it is there seems to be no
practical alternative.
The best instrument for the long
siege of Europe could be Mr. Wilson’s
emphasis on technology. From every
point of view, that of pressing his suit
or of keeping Britain’s claims alive
despite the old man of the EEC, his
championship of a European tech-
nological community (including Britain)
makes excellent sense. Europe’s greatest
challenge in the second half of this
century is likely to be neither the sur-
vival after empire nor the recovery
from war which, with Americaa
aid, it has achieved with astonishing
ease. It is likely to be the second,
science-based industrial revolution now
emanating from America and to a les-
ser extent from the Soviet Union,
Europeans have no chance of getting
into the really big league for this un-
less they come together, and it will not
be very easy for them even then.
Britain’s relative advantages in deal-
ing with Europe are greatest here, be-
cause it has much the most impressive
technological resources in western
Europe, and because most Frenchmen
are keenly aware of this. It is one of
the weak points in the General’s posi-
tion which is bound to make even him
feel uncomfortable. And the need for
this cross-fertilisation of industrial tech-
nology which should stretch far
across the private industrial field is-
therefore one of the most important
matters for Mr. Wilson to press home.
Business Advantages
WHILE exceptions understandably
remain, most British businessmen
themselves are now convinced that the
advantages of membership in the com-
mon market outweigh the risks. Just
now, in fact, British industry’s enthusi-
asm for Europe is a little too good to
be true. Some British industries are
bound to be hurt, and hurt a lot harder
than they are used to. Britain, com-
pared to the Six nowadays, is a highly
protected country just as France
and Italy were when the common,
market began in 1958.
If membership comes in 1967 or
1968, it will not find British industry
in its best position. Investment looks
like falling between 15 and 25 percent
next year. And most British firms are
carrying a lot less protective fat todays
than they were in 1960. Gearing has
been going up, the margin of cash avail-
able for self-financing has been going-
down.
Against this, there is no doubt that
European businessmen have a very
healthy respect today for what the best
of British industry can do. Britain has
some of the biggest and most dynamic
firms in Europe: among the first 20
non-American companies in the For-
tune rankings, seven are British and
seven are German; France and Italy
have only one each. Among the first
200, 28 are British, 19 German, 12
French, and 6 Italian. In Europe, these
figures talk.


Not So Blue at CSR
WILD CAT
PAGES
MARKET POINTERS • SECURITY ANALYSIS • COMMODITIES
MINING • SHARE LIST • BEHIND THE BALANCE SHEETS
By JASON
WITH its inevitably gloomy
approach, the stockmarket found
nothing pleasing in CSR’s de-
cision to close down its steadily losing
blue asbestos mining operations in Wit-
tenoom, Western Australia.
The news brought only a further fall
in CSR’s hard-pressed share price to
$2.77. Yet the end of this running sore
and the deconsolidation of the hard-
board operations, which move into the
recently announced Associated Pulp-
CSR joint company, will give a look
of far greater joy to CSR’s accounts.
Now what is needed is for something
to be done about the dreadful chemical
companies.
Even though the Wittenoom closure
will mean an assets write-down of $3
million, it had been producing losses
since 1963 (this year’s accounts to
March will still suffer from these losses
as well as from the assets write-down).
But as the chairman, Mr. J. W. Dunlop,
pointed out last week, “there are some
substantial offsetting taxation benefits.”
And presumably a lot of the equipment
and labor force could be useful in the
CSR iron ore partnership at nearby
Mt. Newman.
A Sydney broker has circularised his
clients suggesting that CSR’s dividend
could be expected to rise when the
group’s earnings start to increase
which may not be too far off following
three years of falling earnings during
which dividend has shown a modest
increase because of the bonus content
of the 1965 cash issue. He says that
overall sugar returns could be slightly
higher in 1966 because of improved
returns from refining, marketing, and
financing, but that although improved
results are likely from CSR’s Austra-
lian sugar milling interests in 1966,
these could be wholly offset by antici-
pated lower returns from milling in
Fiji.
The broker estimates the average
annual earnings available to CSR from
the Mt. Newman venture over the
period of the Japanese contract at about
25 percent of CSR’s group earnings in
1965-66.
THE coming struggle by two dis-
sident shareholders in Concrete
Industries (Monier) Ltd. to get
on to the board should not detract from
the greater degree of realism directors
show in this year’s set of accounts from
the company.
The two dissidents, Mr. W. H.
Duffy, a director of one of the com-
pany’s subsidiaries, and Mr. J. L. Aston,
a solicitor, are understood to have as-
sociations with Monier’s unsuccessful
Hurstville Super Centre project. They
will be opposing the chairman, Mr.
J. W. Blaiklock, and one of the com-
pany’s senior executives, Mr. H. A.
Wilkinson, standing in the place of
Sydney solicitor Mr. S. J. Carroll, who
is retiring.
The admission by directors in the
latest accounts that the company stands
to lose up to $6 million on the North
West Cape project (excluding the
chance that there could also be liquid-
ated damages) and the provision of
$5,750,000 for contingencies (related
in the greater part to this project) is a
welcome recognition that shareholders
want to know how bad things could
be. The accounts show that even if this
provision is entirely lost, the company
will not be destroyed. The cash on
hand of $2.3 million could meet any
forecast loss on North West Cape that
exceeds the $3 million of the “contin-
gency provision” already invested there.
THE Chartist’s glum look at Linde-
mans on this page (it would be
'•* nice to see the Chartist cheerful
once again) follows a “Behind the Bal-
ance Sheet” item on this company in
the issue of November 19, which showed
the company’s liquidity had been
severely run down. It was subsequently
pointed out here that current sales and
profit trends were not revealed at the
annual meeting, following a year in
which pre-tax profit rose by only 4
percent. If the Chartist is right, and
Lindemans does have a downturn, it
would be wise to keep a ready hand
on a cheque book in case prices get
to bargain levels. For in the long term
the company’s heavy capital expendi-
ture in recent years must pay off.
APART from giving a striking
example of how not to make a
statement to the Press, the messy
bits of information (and misinforma-
tion) that came from Melbourne’s
Golden Poultry Farming Industries
The Chartist says:
LINDEMANS HOLDINGS LTD. should be closely watched by investors as
the “grapes could be about to turn sour.” The overall performance of this
stock since 1961 would be regarded as the “growth” phase in the life cycle in
terms of market appreciation. An upward trend at the rate of approximately 40
percent per annum was maintained with even faster intermediate rates until the
commencement of the general bearish conditions during the early months of 1965.
Since then, a slower uptrend has been followed at an approximate rate of 20 percent
appreciation, but the consolidation pattern in the shape of an upslanting wedge
formed over the past two years has very bearish implications, although it would be
possible for prices to continue to rise to about the $3.30 level in the short term.
However, if sales fall below $2.60, this would give a definite signal that the stock
could be about to change direction. The possibility of a decline to approximately
$2.10 would have to be considered, and investors should also be aware of a more
pessimistic target of approximately $1.60. Last sale price on 2/12/66 $2.78.

Ltd. last week also indicated that even
if there was some uncertainty in
directors’ minds about whether profits
were up or down, at least they were
clearly confident that business in the
broiler chicken business was improv-
ing.
This improvement has been confirmed
by the private newsletter “Inside the
Food Industry” that first revealed some
months ago how bad things were.
The newsletter says that the poultry
glut is easing as growers cut back sup-
plies and prices rise slightly. But it
pointed out that the private operator,
Inghams Enterprises, has emerged from
the crisis as the clearly dominant pro-
cessor in the industry, with its output
(including the Tender Joy line for
Woolworths) totalling 400,000 birds a
week. “This is more than twice Golden
Poultry’s output, three times that of
Provincial Traders’ and four times that
of Steggles’,” it says. (Provincial
Traders has since upped its capacity to
about half Inghams’.)
Golden Poultry’s first buoyant state-
ment last week (unsigned and issued
through a public-relations company)
of increased sales and profits in the
first quarter of 1966-67 has now turned
out to be bunkum (not surprisingly, in
view of the statement by the recently
deposed chairman, Mr. W. Baker, at
the annual meeting that earnings in
the first two months were only marginal
at $1500).
The correct position at Golden
Poultry is that profit was “satisfactory”
for the September quarter (for what
that word is worth) but lower than for
the previous corresponding quarter of
1965. But the bright outlook of the
first statement remained; the whole
mess arose because “the board wanted
to reassure shareholders.”
The statement said that Golden
Poultry had increased its share
of the market despite keen com-
petition and that planned Christmas
sales promotion was expected to lift
turkey sales even higher than the Sep-
tember quarter’s record level.
chickens make up a
relatively small part of Provincial
Traders’ operations, the improvement in
this industry and the likelihood of a
better margarine situation suggest that
this company’s shares may be under-
valued at only 95 cents to yield 5.8
percent on dividend and almost 10 per-
cent on earnings. It has a big stake in
the continuing increases in edible oil-
seed production, having extensive equip-
ment for the extraction of oil from all
types of seeds.
Following last year’s record profit,
Provincial Traders’ group sales were up
20 percent in the first quarter, and the
chairman reported at the annual meet-
ing that the company had no problems
with its chicken operations, although
the drought had affected its margarine
and farming interests (but not enough
to prevent a record profit). The com-
pany recently acquired Swift Australia’s
chicken business to lift its capacity to
about 200,000 birds a week.
Apart from the impact on the de-
mand for the company’s edible oil, the
prospect of higher quotas for margarine
production is important to Provincial
Traders’ own Australia-wide margarine
sales; its quota has been steady for the
past 14 years despite continued pro-
tests. All this, along with better
seasonal conditions, suggests the com-
pany’s share price could be in for a
rise next year.

The yawn
that killed
a business!
Here was a company going places. Up to the minute on the market, knew what their
competitors were doing, continually checking with surveys, research and statistics.
Trouble was, they ignored the most vital statistics of all . . . that major fires put up
to 71% of companies out of business. We tried to point out all these vital points, but
were met with the “Won’t Happen To Me” attitude. Finally the discussion was closed
with a polite yawn of boredom. It happened! They paid the high price . . . loss of
wages, turnover, key staff and customers of years standing. Insurance covered the
physical things . . . but it wasn’t enough! Statistics also show that fires can be
beaten. In fact major fires can be eliminated or drastically reduced. EVERY 24 HOURS

shares at these prices have every right
to be intrigued by last month’s take-
over offer which followed the chair-
man’s comment at September’s annual
meeting that a large buyer of the
shares had asked the board’s attitude to
a prospective bid. They may well
wonder whether Vehicle and General
Insurance, which made last month’s
offer, was the same “large buyer” that
had previously approached the board.
For Melbourne’s leading investment
counsellor, Mr. James W. Cowan, is
executive chairman of Vehicle and
General. A year ago Petroleum Invest-
ments appointed an unnamed but
“highly regarded firm of investment
counsellors” to assist it in its decisions.
Petroleum Investments’ board includes
Brisbane stockbroker Mr. R. M. Corrie
(it also numbered Mr. Corrie’s former
client Mr. R. M. Ansett among its
members for a while), who is believed
to think highly of Mr. Cowan’s invest-
ment services and to suggest their use
to some of his clients.
The Vehicle and General bid seems
likely to succeed; the chairman of
Petroleum Investments had said in Sep-
tember that no offer could be recom-
mended unless it represented a cash
payout commensurate with what share-
holders would have received if the
company had been placed in volun-
tary liquidation. The cash bid of 24
cents a share is very close indeed to
the 26 cents a share assets backing on
market values at June 30 and its share
exchange offer is worth about 31 cents
a share—indicating that there is little
profit in the deal for Vehicle and
General unless it has managed to
acquire many other shares in Petroleum
Investments for much cheaper prices.
Petroleum Investments received some
publicity earlier this year for the high
cost of running the company; its ex-
penses last year of $BBOO were at the
rate of 2.9 percent of its portfolio
(including $2OOO directors’ fees for a
year in which the company increased
its profit and loss account deficit by
$155,520 to $206,918 as it continued
its policy of switching out of oil stocks
into industrials).
A SYDNEY broking house has fol-
lowed up last month’s discussion
on this page on the merits of
Queensland copper-gold miner Mount
Morgan with a very strong recommen-
dation to clients to buy the shares de-
spite the prospect of a lower copper
price in the long run.
The broker takes the view that
Mount Morgan’s earnings should treble
this year from last year’s drought-
affected 35 cents per $1 share to give
an earning rate on capital in excess of
100 percent —with the figures now sug-
gesting a rate around 120 percent.
This would result from a maintenance
of production at 48 percent above last
year’s level at prices 29 percent higher.
At current share prices around $2.90,
a 120 percent earning rate would repre-

sent a price earnings ratio of only
about times, and the company’s past
history indicates a liberal dividend
policy which has always been tax free,
the broker says.
THERE should be no doubts about
the success of this week’s FNCB-
Waltons Corporation Ltd. deben-
ture and note issue; the interest rate,
down only slightly from the previous
capital raising when the company was
Waltons’ Credit Corporation, is not only
attractive, but the role of the First
National City Bank of New York and
the arrangements by which Waltons
buys back some of the FNCB-Waltons
debts (the difficult ones?) give an added
sense of security to the issue.
The Melbourne broking house of
J. B. Were and Son, which has had some
heavy undersubscriptions to recent
fixed interest issues (the sub-underwrit-
ers had to contribute s6£ million of its
recent $8 million Olympic Consolidated
Industries note issue, for example), was
formerly Waltons’ broker, but in recent
years the company has got by without
any underwriter. The latest issue is
underwritten by the Sydney broker,
Hordern Utz and Bode.
THERE are mounting prospects
that another mineral sands float
could come on the market early
in the new year. It is Cudgen R.Z.,
whose sand deposits are on the north-
ern N.S.W. coast not far from the
Queensland border and 1 whose output
is believed to be around 30,000 tons
of rutile and 37,000 tons of zircon
yearly. This places it slightly ahead of
Consolidated Rutile Ltd., which was
floated a year ago by Sydney brokers
Hordern Utz and Bode.
■ Cudgen R.Z. is owned by the Foy-
ster family, who were the vendors of
Consolidated Rutile’s Stradbroke
Island deposits for $2.4 million. Three
poysters, all of whom live on Queens-
land’s Gold Coast, are on Consolidated
Rutile’s board Clive as managing
director, Lloyd, and Mark.
APPOINTING a technical man, Mr.
C. Herkenhoff, as general
manager of the local Pickands
Mather organisation under managing
director Bill Conway underlines the
importance of the pelletising process
in the Tasmanian Savage River iron
ore development the company is man-
aging. Instead of simply exporting the
ore to Japan and beneficiating it there,
which would be an expensive freight
operation in view of its iron content,
E. Herkenholf
the company is
in effect creating
an industry rather
than simply dig-
ging a quarry.
For Herkenhoff,
a mining and
metallurgical en-
gineer who spent
the 1950 s as assist-
ant chief metal-
lurgist at Pick-
a n d s Mather’s
main laboratories
(before going to
Utah Construction as director of
metallurgical research), was one of
the key men involved in developmental
design and operation work at Erie
Mining Co. in Minnesota, which PM
organised and manages and which was
the world’s first large-scale plant for
beneficiating and pelletising low-grade
iron ore.
PM was a pioneer in finding out
how to up-grade low-grade ore, and its
present day reputation is probably
strongest in this field.

Trends in Metals Usage
WORLD metals statistics are
usually rather slow in appearing
and Metallgesellschaft AG has
only recently released its metals stat-
istics for 1965. But they are of interest,
especially as there has been evidence
that trends established last year have
continued this year. Aluminium and
nickel were the only two metals of the
six reviewed to lift consumption faster
than production during 1965.
Primary (excluding scrap) alumin-
ium production grew 6.3 percent from
6.08 million metric tons (of 22041 b.)
to 6.46 million tons. Consumption rose
8.1 percent to 6.51 million tons —r
changing an overall surplus of 60,000
tons to a deficit of 50,000 tons. (These
and the following figures exclude scrap,
supplies of which are of importance,
especially when supply is close to
balance with demand.)
Nickel output climbed 5.1 percent to
410,000 tons, while use jumped 7.5
percent to 430,000 tons, lifting deficit
from 10,000 tons to 20,000 tons.
Tin use and production both held
steady, at 200,000 and 220,000 tons
respectively. Metals statistics, as well
as being late, are often inconsistent,
and some sources report a narrowing
of the tin gap from about 22,000 to
14,000 tons.
Lead, zinc, and copper made up the
other side of the picture consump-
tion grew more slowly than production.
Lead output rose 2.9 percent to
3,160,000 tons, while use lifted 2.0 per-
cent to 3,120,000 tons, bringing surplus
from 10,000 tons to 40,000 tons.
Zinc production was up 2.9 percent
to 4,040,000 tons while use was up 3.8
percent to 4,080,000 tons, reducing
deficit from 80,000 to 40,000 tons.
1A ND copper production increased 5.7
percent to 6,140,000 tons, while con-
sumption rose only 3.1 percent to
6,070,000 tons, changing a deficit of
80,000 to a surplus of 70,000. As a
comparison, crude steel consumption
grew by 5.2 percent higher then
the 4.7 percent average for the non-
ferrous metals.
Aluminium’s rapid expansion has
taken it to top place among the non-
ferrous metals, and it now represents
31.9 percent of the total, against cop-
per’s 29.7 percent.
An interesting relationship shown up
by Metallgesellschaft is that between
price and consumption trends, al-
though a cause and effect relationship
can hardly be presumed. Disregarding
the fall in the value of money, the price
of aluminium has risen 100 percent
since 1935. Copper is now eight times
as expensive; lead and zinc almost
seven times; tin, already dear in 1935,
almost six times; and nickel only three
times as expensive.
Aluminium and nickel show by far
the highest growth rates for the period
—lO.B percent and 5.8 percent respec-
tively (average annual). This compares
with 2.8 percent for lead, 4.1 percent
for copper, 3.7 percent for zinc, and
1.1 percent for tin.
IT is reported that as well as the
proposed lift in capacity, the
Gladstone alumina partners have
discussed admission of a new member.
The Japanese firm Showa Denko has
been mentioned. Such a move would
fit with the general trend in Japan to
service raw material supplies.
The lift in output is expected to be
to about 865,000 tons, or possibly to
900,000 (theoretical maximum is 1.8
million), from the 600,000 tons which
will begin operation next year.
THE U.S. General Services Admini-
tration has lent support to the
bullish interpretation of its state-
ment on its stockpile tin sales policy.
The GSA last month restricted sales
of the “A” grade metal, the best
quality remaining in stockpiles. The
move was explained as being intended
to minimise world market price disrup-
tions. The LME price is hovering
above £stg.l2oo a ton.
ZINC prices weakened in London
last week following a forecast of
a possible 123,000 metric ton
world surplus of the metal next year.
This International Lead and Zinc
Study Group figure is less than the
annual rate of the recent production
cuts by major smelters. But it under-
lines zinc’s problems, and LME prices
are certainly much more realistic now,
at around £stg.loo a ton.
The surplus predicted for lead is
44,000 tons, and release of this figure
put paid to a slow recovery evident in
lead prices previously.
CUBA has started harvesting what
it hopes will be a record 1967
sugar crop. The start on the
harvest is the earliest ever, and the
aim is a total milling of 7.5 million
tons of sugar by May;
Last year a bad drought followed
by heavy rains hit output, which was
2.5 million tons below expectations at
4.5 million. This was also well down
from the previous record—
tons in 1952.
Meanwhile, Cuba has sent a delega-
tion to the latest UN preliminary talks
on sugar —it did not attend the July or
September meetings.
Shipments of tea from Ceylon
have been held up by a strike
which began in Colombo early
in November. More than 30 million lb.
of tea are held up on estates and in
warehouses. Not only will Australian
tea merchants have their supplies dis-
rupted but prices are being forced up
by the shortage.
Values in London for Ceylon teas
rose eightpence a pound in the first
three weeks of November. Indian tea
values have also risen. However, tea
prices generally are still twopence a
pound below year-ago levels.

SHARE YIELDS AND STATISTICS
The Reserve Bank’s considerable bond market activity has
continued, with the aim and effect of lowering short and
medium term yields; the markets are taking some cues from
this operation. The Reserve’s release from Statutory Reserve
Deposits also brought some bank shares into favor. On differing
annual results, British Tobacco added 17 cents to reach $2.24,
while Clyde Industries was depressed six cents to touch a decade’s
low of 84 cents. Ampol picked up three cents to finish at 62 cents;
Ansett slipped a further two cents to 59 cents. Among miners,
North Broken Hill jumped a good 27 cents to hit $4.12.

per day and, with a return to the
average grade of 3.2 percent of copper
reserves, copper output should move
above the 1965-66 level of 76,000 tons.
The No. 1 and No. 3 concentrators,
which have a combined capacity of
• approximately 10,600 tons per day,
are now treating the copper ore, while
the new No. 2 concentrator, with a
capacity of 5400 tons per day, is be-
ing used for lead-zinc ore (although it
can be switched to copper ore treat-
ment if desired).
When full capacity is achieved,
annual ore throughput will rise to 5.6
million tons, which, on the present
usage pattern of the three concen-
trators, would include some 3.7 mil-
lion tons of copper ore and 1.9 million
tons of lead-zinc ore, an increase of
42 percent over 1965-66 treatment
rates. If it is assumed that grades of
ore treated remain constant at 1965-66
levels (3.2 percent Cu, 6.8 percent Pb,
and 4.9 percent Zn), then production
of these metals may also rise by 42
percent to approximately 104,000 tons
of copper, 90,000 tons of lead, and
45,000 tons of zinc.
It seems unlikely that the estimated
capacity output of 104,000 tons of
copper will be achieved until close to
1970. However, if copper prices fall to
levels between £stg.3oo and £stg.3so
($750-$870), the company will need to
increase its copper output to levels of
at least 80,000 tons by 1967-68 to
counteract the anticipated unfavorable
markets for lead and zinc. If produc-
tion can be increased above this level,
or if copper prices average above
£stg.3so per ton, an increase in net
profit above 1965-66 levels could be
expected.
even if copper prices do fall as
low as £stg.3oo a ton by the time
Mount Isa reaches its projected pro-
duction levels in 1970, and if lead and
zinc prices drop to around the £stg.Bo
a ton level, the company’s gross revenue
from copper, lead, and zinc should jump
by more than one third over last year’s
$BO million to almost $llO million,
indicating a substantial profit rise de-
spite the inevitable increase in costs
that would follow such a lift in pro-
duction. And for every £stg.lo by
which the copper price . exceeds
£stg.3oo, there would be a s2£ million
addition to Isa’s revenue. Unlike the
Barrier companies (with the exception
of New Broken Hill Limited), Mount
Isa Mines Ltd. has virtually no invest-
ment income to underpin its mine
earnings. Consequently the company
is more susceptible to fluctuations in
metal prices, particularly copper.
Although its long-term prospects remain
very sound (even excluding the pros-
pects at MacArthur River) the com-
pany’s share price could be affected by
any marked weakening in copper prices.
MINING
Mt. Isa's Next Few Years
SHORT-TERM worries about the
likely impact of lower metal
prices and lower-grade ore on
profits in the next couple of years have
taken some of the shine off Mount Isa
shares, which had swung strongly into
market favor with an excellent result
for 1965-66.
With the higher Australian Producers’
price for copper coinciding with the
recent commissioning of Mount Isa’s
new K 57 shaft and No. 2 concentrator,
two major items in the company’s $l3O
million expansion program, prospects
looked bright for a further increase
on the 1965-66 record profit of $16.8
million. The share market seemed to
be expecting a higher output and higher
average price for copper, the source of
about 70 percent of the company’s
revenue, to far outweigh the decline in
lead prices in the current year.
However, the market received a
dampening influence when the chair-
man, Mr. G. R. Fisher, announced at
last month’s annual meeting that he
expected 1966-67 profits to be “some-
what similar’’ to those of last year.
The main reason for this rather disap-
pointing forecast is the lower grade of
copper ore being treated in the current
year, a factor which the market had
not, taken into acount. The grade of
primary copper ore treated in the first
16 weeks to October 23, 1966, averaged
2.6 percent copper compared with the
average grade of 3.2 percent for copper
ore treated in 1965-66.
F is a traditional feature of mining
development that poorer grades which
have to be removed sooner or later are
handled at times when metal prices are
high enough to make a profit on the
deal. . There is an added reason at
Mount Isa, where this lower grade is
expected to prevail until at least the
end of the current financial year,
when installation of the primary
crusher at the K 57 shaft will permit
full-scale extraction to commence in
the higher grade 1100 orebodv below
13 level. Until then, ore production
cannot be increased sufficiently to
counter the effect of the lower-grade
ore. In fact, Mr. Fisher has predicted
that copper output in 1966-67 will drop
by some 10,000 tons to around 66,000
tons.
Lead production, however, is expected
to rise by 10,000 tons, or 16 percent, to
over 73,000 tons. Although the chair-
man made no forecast of zinc produc-
tion, if a 16 percent increase in output
occurs, in line with lead production,
zinc metal output for 1966-67 will be
in the vicinity of 37,500 tons.
It seems reasonable to assume that
the chairman, in making his forecast
of steady profits in 1966-67, is expect-
ing higher costs, particularly wages
(although the outcome of the com-
pany’s offer to the unions is not yet
known), plus a decline in lead and
probably also in zinc prices, to be
balanced by a substantially higher
average price for copper.
In 1965-66 the average metal prices
realised by the company were $BOB
per ton for copper, $265 for lead, and
$271 for zinc. With sales of these
products at 73,000 tons of copper, 55,260
tons of lead, and 51,620 tons of zinc,
gross revenue, excluding sales of by-
products such as dross and cadmium,
would have amounted to nearly $BO
million. Silver sales would have added
a further $5 million.
I F it is conservatively estimated that
the company’s average price realised
per ton of copper in the second half
of the current year is $9OO, then the.
average for the full year could be
about $960, or $l5O higher than in 1965-
66. With industry forecasts of copper
shortages in Australia in the coming
year, it seems reasonable to assume that
the entire anticipated output of 66,000
tons will be sold. At an average price
of $950, this would yield $63 million in
copper revenue compared with $57.5
million last year.
LME lead prices, which have fallen
from £stg.94 per ton to current levels
just above £stg.Bo, do not seem likely
to rise much above this level for the
remainder of the year in view of fore-
casts of a world lead surplus next year.
An average lead price of £stg.B3 pet-
ton ($210) for the year seems not un-
reasonable. Meanwhile, the zinc pro-
ducers’ price has remained steady at
£stg. 102, with producers attempting
to keep prices at this level by means of
production cut-backs.
Despite this, experts are forecasting
a world zinc surplus in 1967 in the
vicinity of 120,000 tons. It seems likely
that, in spite of their efforts to keep
prices at current levels, the producers
will be forced to reduce their zinc price
in the coming months. In this event,
the average price for Mount Isa’s zinc
in 1966-67 could be about $240
(£stg.97) per ton, with further falls in
the following year.
In view of the predicted world sur-
pluses in lead and zinc in 1967 and
1968, there may be some build-up of
Mount Isa’s stocks of these metals
and', despite production increases, sales
might only rise to 59,000 tons of lead
and 30,000 tons of zinc metal, yield-
ing revenue of approximately $2O mil-
lion. Gross revenue from sales of the
company’s three major products, cop-
per, lead, and zinc, would then amount
to $B3 million in 1966-67 compared
with $BO million in 1965-66. After
allowing for some increases in opera-
ting costs, railage, wages, etc., net
profits would indeed be similar to last
year’s level.
In 1967-68, the installation of the
underground crusher in the K 57 com-
plex will enable ore throughput to
reach its planned rate of 16,000 tons

BEHIND THE BALANCE SHEETS
Gadsden out of the Doldrums
AFTER years in the doldrums
Melbourne-based canmaker J.
Gadsden is at last emerging into
what should be some good trade winds.
The fact that the stockmarket does not
think so (it has marked the shares down
below $1.50 from levels earlier this
year of $l.BO, despite a lift in dividend
from 7 percent to 8 percent) gives in-
vestors an excellent opportunity of buy-
ing into this stock on very good terms.
For the company is now in a better
financial state than at any time for
years.
Gadsden has done very well indeed
out of the coming of beer cans; it has
the major part of the business in Aus-
tralia. Now that the initial growth has
gone out of this business, which is grow-
ing now at a steady rather than a
dynamic pace, the swing into cans for
carbonated beverages (and mixed
drinks) has given a significant impetus
to the company. And it should con-
tinue to do better out of its half
interest in steel-drum maker, Austra-
lian Packaging Industries. On the
other hand, its cardboard carton opera-
tion (which makes Rothmans cigarette
packets and is also in the highly com-
petitive cardboard container business
for the food industry) may not be doing
terribly well in view of Rothmans’ fall-
ing market share.
But the main thing about Gadsden
is that the company’s financial position
has improved drastically from one of
expansionary indigestion and tight
liquidity into a healthy liquid state.
Its cash flow (last year it reached
$2.2 million despite the higher divi-
dend) is such as to provide for the
company’s likely re-equipment needs
which, while expensive, are neverthe-
less not likely to require anything like
the huge expenditures of the early
19605. That sort of expansion seems
to be behind the company now. As a
result, the company could decide not
to refinance the $2 million in 8 percent
unsecured notes that fall due next
April; its present high liquidity could
meet this repayment and it seems un-
likely that any real need for funds of
this order would arise for a few years,
unless the company decides to make
significant increases in the proportion
of profit it pays in dividends. And it
may prefer to wait until interest rates
are lower.
JTROM the 1963 nadir, earnings on
capital and on total funds have been
steadily upgraded; the company seems
poised for some real profit growth, par-
ticularly if it can throw off the yoke
of interest payments, up in the year to
June from $370,000 to $426,000. Be-
sides the $1.73 million borrowed in
mortgage loans on freeholds at June
30, the company had $4 million in
unsecured notes ($2 million of these
maturing next April). Amongst cur-
rent assets J. Gadsden has built up
$560,000 in short-term deposits over
the past two years which could serve
as a sinking fund toward the notes re-
demption. So their repayment would
present few problems, particularly as
bank overdraft, reduced from $399,000
to $lOl,OOO over the year, could be
extended if needed.
The company has relied heavily for
finance on “deposits at call,” but these
are not as temporary as they look, being
largely from the Gadsden family and
from the company’s superannuation
fund. In any event, as its liquidity im-
proves, they are being whittled away;
this last year they were reduced from
sl.2m. to $963,000. (They have been
as high as $2.2m. in the past.)
The past two years’ trading has been
been vastly more profitable than in
prior years as capital expenditure has
slowed down markedly. Certainly, being
caught with a $254,000 bad debt on
Foster Clark companies in 1963 was
an unexpected blow at a time when
capital expenditure was high. Disagree-
ment with the Tax Commissioner as to
whether expenditure was of a capital
nature or not necessitated appropriation
in 1965 of $354,000 for additional in-
come tax in respect of years prior to
1965. The matter was settled in the
year under review, with $111,903 being
written back into the profit and loss
appropriation account.
Income from general investments of
$58,000 includes the first dividend of
$35,000 from the associate company,
Australian Packaging Industries Pty.
(owned 50-50 with Van Leer Tambores
S.A., of Panama). This company was
set up in 1961 to make large steel
drums (in competition with Rheem),
and plastic containers and packaging
materials of flexible and non-flexible
nature. The company caters for the
oil, chemical, paint, and food industries.
After an initial loss, the company had
accumulated profit of about $300,000
‘(after paying the maiden 7 percent
dividend of $70,000) at June, 1965, on
capital of $lm. Gadsden’s share of the
API profits would have lifted its own
earnings in each of the years 1964 and
1965 by over $100,000 had they been
consolidated. API results for 1966 have
not yet been reported, but are believed
to have increased further. The 1966
dividend (likely to be steady) will be
incorporated in Gadsden’s 1967 pro-
fits.
Both shareholders have advanced
large sums to API, besides their
$500,000 investment apiece. Most of
the “other debtors” in Gadsden’s non-
current assets, described as unsecured
advances to an associate company, re-
payable at no fixed date (down from
$736,000 to $686,000) would be to API.
The interest earned by Gadsden is be-
lieved to be around the “going rate.”
Now that API’s establishment phase
appears to be almost over, a more gener-
ous dividend policy could reasonably
be expected, supercharging Gadsden’s
own accelerated earnings.
There is a claim against Gadsden for
a substantial sum which is the subject
of litigation but it was not specified
in the accounts because it is a cross-
claim to one made by Gadsden.
Two paragraphs in the 1966 directors’
report and chairman’s address may be
read as official advice that the dividend
rate will remain steady in the immedi-
ate future, but earning rate will im-
prove. “The continuing process of plant
and equipment replacement and im-
provement, with the attendant price
spiral, creates the necessity of conserving
our financial strength to meet the com-
pany’s expansion program. After the
enormous cost of expansion over re-
cent years we readily welcomed a period
of stabilisation and the opportunity of
consolidating our financial position.”
But investors prepared to put up
with a 5.4 percent dividend yield for a
couple of years should find their
patience rewarded.

SECURITY ANALYSIS
Boral A Fallen Leader
IN this series, I propose to depart
from the usual practice of con-
sidering an industry group. I will
instead consider five companies which
were previously regarded as “leaders”
(and priced accordingly), but which
have now fallen from favor. There are
a number of such companies—perhaps
not quite as many as the fallen angels
in “Paradise Lost”—and it would have
been equally possible to select several
other groups of five. In my selection,
I have taken those which have fallen
more than 30 percent from their high
point of 1966, which is a fair fall
because the Sydney all ordinaries in-
vestment index has only fallen 8J per-
cent during 1966.
The selected companies are: Boral
Limited, Commonwealth Industrial
Gases Limited, Dunlop Rubber (Aus-
tralia) Limited, Grace Brothers Hold-
ings Limited, and Minster Limited.
Currently these stocks are selling at
prices which give immediate dividend
yields varying from 4.2 percent (Grace
Bros.) to 8 percent (Minster), and
price/earnings multiples varying from
7.3 (Minster) to 16.7 (Boral). While
the dividend yields are factual, the
price/earnings multiples are open to
variation according to one’s own judg-
ment regarding earnings. For example,
I think that Boral’s earnings are rather
higher than actually disclosed and the
price/earnings ratio, in my view, is
nearer to 15.4.
'J'HE last issue by Boral to share-
holders was made in July, 1961,
when a million shares were issued at
$1.50 each. After this issue, there were
11 million shares on issue. Since then,
more than 20 million shares have been
issued to other than shareholders to
acquire other companies and assets;
the shareholders of 1961 have seen the
earning rate (on my basis of calcula-
tion) drop from 15.8 cents per share
down to 12 cents per share.
However, this seems hardly likely to
be the root cause of their disenchant-
ment, for the peak share price was
reached in the 1964 calendar year when
the price of the shares touched $3.50.
At this price, the immediate dividend
yield was 2.9 percent and the price/
earnings multiple 25.8.
It might be interesting to consider
the rate of growth that might have
been anticipated by a price/earnings
multiple of this magnitude. Firstly, let
us make the assumption that in very
few cases would any analyst care to
predict earnings growth beyond a five-
year period. After such a period, he
could perhaps consider that earnings
might continue to grow but only at the
general inflation rate, which for this
purpose will be taken as 3 percent per
annum compound.
It then becomes a matter of deciding
what would be an acceptable price/
earnings multiple (or earnings yield)
if growth of only 3 percent per annum
compound was to occur in perpetuity.
To be generous, I will assume that a
7 percent earnings yield would be
acceptable, i.e., so that the effective
earnings yield will become 10 percent
per annum with the 3 percent growth
rate. If one is willing to accept a price/
earnings multiple of 25.8 or an earn-
ings yield of 3.9 percent, then the
growth rate of earnings per share for
the next five years must be of the order
of 23 percent per annum compound.
Expressed in another fashion, the per
share earnings of 1963-64, 13.6 cents
per share, would have needed to increase
to 38.4 cents per share by 1968-69 to
justify the price of $3.50.
As it so happens, the trend in per
share earnings of Boral Limited until
1963-64 had been as follows:
Year to
June 30 1958 1959 1960 1961 1962 1963 1964
Per share
earnings
(cents) 7.4 9.4 15 7 15 8 10.3 16.2 13.6
Index
1958=100 100 128 212 214 140 219 184
Even if one optimistically assumed
that the earnings of 1961-62 and 1963-
64 were depressing accidents, one could
hardly have assumed that, from the per
share earnings of 1959-60, 1960-61, and
1962-63, growth of the order of 23 per-
cent per annum compound on average
was likely to occur from 1963-64
onwards.
Of course, “Old boy” talk might
well have resulted in the price being
pushed up to the high levels which it
achieved during 1964. “Old boy” talk
to me means the type of comment
which says, “You must buy Boral, they
are going into fertilisers (or blue metal
or oil or even clothes pegs) in a big
way and the price is sure to go up.”
No mention is ever made of “why” or
“by how much” or whether the rise
if it occurs will be sustainable by
increased earnings per share.
Since 1960-61, Boral’s per share
earnings have been decreasing at an
average compound rate of about 5£
percent per annum, so clearly one can-
not pay anything for future growth in
such cases. The maximum price that
could be placed upon the shares —and
this would mean that one was confident
that no further decreases would occur
in the earnings per share—would be
$1.20, i.e., 10 times earnings.
It is rather difficult to get any better
idea of the group prospects. The distri-
bution of assets between groups is as
follows:
Boral group 38%
Albion Reid group 18%
Mount Lyell Investments group 17%
Gas Supply group 13%
Petrochemical group 7%
(about 55% owned)
Hebbum group 4%
(about 59% owned)
Huddart Parker group 3%
Profits are unlikely to be in the same
proportions. For example, listed in-
vestments, which form 20 percent of
the assets, only seem to have contributed
about 7 percent of profit before tax and
depreciation, but about 21 percent of
net consolidated profit after tax. How-
ever, if it is assumed that, by and
large, profits would be contributed in
much the same proportions as the assets
are distributed, then I would estimate
that future growth in earnings could
hardly exceed 7 percent per annum
compound. Clearly this is an approxi-
mate figure and based on a number of
assumptions, but when it is used to
find the approximate price for Boral’s
shares, I come up with the answer of
$2.10. This would suggest that Boral’s
shares are undervalued as to 12 percent
at the present time, when they are
selling 20 percent below the 1966 high
point.

THE
SOUTH BRITISH INSURANCE
COMPANY LIMITED
Address to Shareholders by the Chairman,
Mr. Kenneth B. Myers, at the Annual General Meeting
held at the Head Office of the Company,
Auckland, New Zealand, on 24th November, 1966
Ladies and Gentlemen,
v ,
Your Directors again take pleasure in
presenting Annual Statements of
Account which show that underwriting
results, investment income and total
profit of the Group all advanced to new
levels, but to enable the full significance
of these variations to be seen in proper
perspective, I propose first of all to
amplify the reference in the Directors’
Report to the change which took place
, . ° . ..
during the year in the composition of
the Grouo
Last year, I traced our association in:
South Africa with the Union & Nat-
ional Insurance Company Limited and
outlined reasons why, in order to eii-
hance its standing as a “national”
company, it was decided to revise its
capital structure and to widen the
element of South African shareholding.
Subsequent to completion of these
arrangements, representations were made
, r
o your oar tat t e prospects o
nion & National would be even more
enhanced if it were to be endowed with:
the true status of a South African com-
pany by allowing a majority of its
shares to be owned by South African
interests. These representations, coming
as they did from a responsible source,.
naturally called for full investigation,
and after careful assessment of all the
factors involved, your Directors reached
the conclusion that, taking the long
view, the interests of South British
shareholders would best be served by
reducing your Company’s
in Union & National to below 50%, and
the necessary number of shares was dis-
posed of at a satisfactory price. As
anticipated, the decision to reduce our
interest met with immediate response by
attracting to Union & National a large
block of desirable business, followed
by indications of further support of a
like nature in which, as the largest
shareholder in Union & National, your
Company indirectly participates. As
befitting that position, we continue to
maintain a close liaison with the Board
of Union & National and the benefit
of our long experience on an inter-
national scale remains available to our
former subsidiary.
By reason of the reduction in our
shareholding, Union & National ceased
to be a subsidiary in terms of the New
Zealand Companies Act, and for this
reason, its figures are excluded from
Group accounts for the year just closed
although they remain in the compara-
tive figures for the previous year. As
Union & National has in the past been
a consistent contributor to the con-
solidated figures, it will at once be
apparent that the improvement in both
underwriting profits and investment in-
come achieved by remaining members of
the Group is even greater than the
respective gains of £105,839 and £42,802
revealed by the published accounts. Like-
wise, instead of an apparent fractional
decline, total premiums written by Group
■companies actually increased by nearly
3% during the year, and had it not
been for devaluation of the Indian Rupee,
“the record revenue figure established last
-year would have been exceeded.
REVENUE ACCOUNTS
The figures j have already quoted
speak for the continuance of our policy
of contro n e d expansion with the
emphasis remaining on the quality rather
t h an the quant i ty 0 f t h e business
accepted, although within that pattern
some variation is to be expected in the
fortunes of the separate underwriting
departments.
Thus it is that in the face of rising fire
wastage, accompanied by the continuing
trend towar d s finer nremium rates nur
irena towards nner premium rates, our
Fire department experienced a deteriora-
tion j n resu jts from Australia and New
Zealand where it appears the market
j s re i uc t an t to heed the expensive les-
sons learned by underwriters in Europe
and North America over recent years. It
is with some satisfaction, however, that
I am able to report an improvement in
results from this section of our United
Kingdom business, but the most sig-
nificant contribution to the increased
T Y , • Came
from international reinsurance business
accepted and administered in London,
which provided welcome relief from the
adverse results of recent years,
In the Accident department, the con-
tinued application of strict underwrit-
ing principles justified itself by corn-
mensurate returns from the Personal
Accident and Miscellaneous sections, but
there was no relief from the incidence
and cost of motor accidents which re-
main a matter of constant concern. This
year, however, we enjoyed a rather
better than usual result from Workmen’s
Compensation business within the toler-
ance allowed by the legislative control


exercised in Australia and New Zealand,
the two principal fields in which we
write this class of business.
In contrast to the Fire and Accident
departments, there was a sharp recession
in the profit from Marine underwriting
which followed the pattern experienced
by the major markets of the world. The
high incidence of serious casualties, which
included an unusual and disturbing
number of modern and expensive vessels,
contributed to the less favourable result
and never before has the Company been
involved in claims in respect of so many
well found vessels totally lost. It is
generally accepted in the London market
that rates have been inadequate and steps
being taken to correct that situation en-
courage the belief that an improvement
can be expected. Until this is supported
by firm evidence, our acceptance of
Marine business on the London market
is being restricted.
As is to be expected, Australia and
New Zealand continue to be our prin-
cipal fields, and under present conditions,
probably offer more scope for expan-
sion than do most other countries in
which we are established. It is a source
of considerable satisfaction, therefore,
that underwriting results from the former
have been strongly supported by profits
returned by our in Africa, India
and the Far East, although in the United
Kingdom, improvements achieved by the
Fire & Accident department were more
than offset by the loss sustained from
Marine underwriting. We greatly value
the operations of our overseas branches
which improve the balance and spread
of our portfolio, two elements which are
of fundamental importance.
Underlying the success of the year’s
activities has been the ability to con-
tain expenses within acceptable limits.
Unfortunately this did not apply to
four provincial offices established in the
United Kingdom some years ago, which,
over a~ lengthy trial period, have been
unable to operate as economic units.
Arrangements have accordingly been
made, though not without considerable
regret, for these offices to be closed, but
our Fire & Accident department will
continue to function in London as it
has done for very many years.
INVESTMENTS
The management and disposition of
your Group’s investments assume in-
creasing importance, not only for the
income they produce, but also for their
support of underwriting operations. In-
flationary trends and balance of pay-
ment problems which have afflicted so
many countries have led to development
of a pattern of high interest rates and,
in a number of cases, to Government
intervention and imposition of more res-
trictive exchange controls. Besides add-
ing to the prevalent atmosphere of gen-
eral uncertainty and loss of business con-
fidence, these measures in our case have
tended to restrict the mobility of our
funds and hence our ability to deploy
them as we would wish. Nevertheless,
we believe our portfolio is judiciously
selected and well spread, both nationally
and internationally, a benefit which
shareholders will recognise in view of
talk of devaluation and restrictions im-
posed on the purchase and sale of over-
seas securities within New Zealand.
Although the higher interest rate
structure benefits investment income, the
corollary of lower price levels for exist-
ing fixed-interest investments naturally
reacts upon the market value of your
Group’s substantial portfolio of gilt-
edged securities. In conjunction with the
wide-spread decline in Stock Exchange
quotations for equity shares, this has
reduced the margin by which market
values of investments at last balance date
exceeded book values to approximately
£150,000.
A consequence of monetary restric-
tions which causes us some concern is
that many of our clients, denied access
to their normal sources of finance, have
turned to us for assistance. While we
endeavour to help our friends when-
ever possible, we feel sure they will
appreciate that the disabilities' I have
already mentioned necessarily limit the
funds we have available.
PROFITS APPROPRIATIONS
AND RESERVES
Transfers from Revenue Accounts plus
income from investments totalled
£1,886,542 and after providing £203,986
for depreciation, net profit of the Group
amounted to £1,682,556, the highest
ever recorded. £465,000 was transferred
to General Reserves, and following pay-
ment of an interim dividend of 6d. per
share in April last, your Directors now
recommend a final dividend of lOd.
per share to make a total distribution
for the year of l/4d. per share.
Technical reserves in the form of
provisions for losses and unexpired risks
are commensurate with commitments
and the Group’s entire underwriting
portfolio is additionally supported by
free reserves as represented by share-
holders’ funds which now exceed
£16,000,000, or almost 95% of last
year’s premium income. This is a
position of great strength which it will
be our endeavour to maintain and so
finance our own expansion.
THE UNITED INSURANCE
COMPANY LIMITED
At this point I wish especially to
mention the efforts of our major Aus-
tralian subsidiary, The United Insurance
Company Limited, which contributed in
full measure to the success of the year’s
activities. In addition, Directors of that
company, with their intimate knowledge
of the Australian economy, have been of
great assistance in administering invest-
ments in the Commonwealth and I am
pleased to have this opportunity to
acknowledge their wholehearted co-
operation in thus promoting the interests
of the Group.
A.M.P. FIRE & GENERAL
INSURANCE COMPANIES
Last year I told you of arrangements
by which the non-life subsidiaries of the
A.M.P. Society would assume manage-
ment of their own affairs. At that time it
was predicted that phased transfer of
control would be completed within 18
months. In fact, however, this was com-
pleted well ahead of schedule and hav-
ing now relinquished our responsibilities,
we welcome the A.M.P. Fire and General
Companies as friendly competitors in the
Australian and New Zealand markets.
PROPERTIES
You will also recall my mention of a
proposed redevelopment of the two
properties adjoining Head Office build-
ing in Shortland Street to provide much
needed additional accommodation for
the Guardian Trust, United’s Auckland
branch and our own needs. Plans have
since been approved for the new build-
ing and no doubt the Architects’ per-
spective appearing inside the back cover
of this year’s Statements of Account
is of interest to you. Those in atten-
dance today will have observed that
operations on the site are well under way.
Alterations have been effected to our
Perth building in which United’s branch
office is now accommodated so as to
permit integration of group affairs in
that city. With the same purpose,
arrangements are in hand for the erection
of a modern building on the present
South British site in Brisbane and a
new building at Bunbury in Western
Australia will be completed shortly.
As I have stated on previous occasions,
our property investments are directed
principally towards ensuring that our
staff is permanently housed in modern
premises with up-to-date amenities and
equipment. For that reason, we do not
regard our buildings as assets to be
bought or sold at will and as there is
therefore no occasion to establish their
market values, your Board considers it.
best to carry them in the books at cost
less normal depreciation. Purely as a
matter of interest, therefore, reasonably
estimated market values exceed book
values by approximately £1,400,000.
STAFF
The accomplishments of the past year
were only possible through the efforts
of our very capable and loyal staff. They
are the Company and they are its future
and in recognition of their efforts pro-
vision has again been made in the
accounts for payment of a staff bonus
for which your Board asks for approval
today.

THE FORGOTTEN NORTH
Last week, Peter Samuel put the
case for U.S. investment in Australia
in general terms; in this article,
RONALD ANDERSON argues
specifically in favor of U.S. invest-
ment in the cattle industry.
CAPE YORK PENINSULA is Aus-
tralia’s forgotten land. But for
the bauxite at Weipa, the land
north of latitude 16 could be part of
another continent, so little is it in-
volved in the life of the rest of Aus-
tralia. Cape York’s 43 million acres
three-quarters the size of Victoria
is a land apart, a no-man’s land, a
last frontier. In Sydney and Melbourne
we are in the Space Age, but north of
Cairns they are still pioneers.
Cape York, in spite of Weipa, re-
mains a wild and colorful land. It
must be one of the few parts of Aus-
tralia where poddy-dodging (the steal-
ing of unbranded calves) still rates as
a local sport, and where the crime is
not being caught but in reporting a
theft to the police. Cape York is
changing, slowly, of course. The recent
wave of American investment in cattle
properties promises to hasten the trend.
But nature is still harsher there than
in the tamed South. Stations are still
cut off for five months during the
“Wet” and only fools from the South
risk the jaws of the big estuarine crocs
by swimming in the rivers or water-
holes. Nobody goes strolling about at
night without a light there are
too many death adders about and
a rifle is still a man’s most valued
companion away from the homestead.
The cooling evening breeze sweeping
in from the Coral Sea is symbolic,
however, of what the American money
(for there are no Americans there) is
doing to Cape York. In less than
twelve months it has begun to shake
loose the lethargy and apathy born out
of a country of frustration and heart-
break.
Cape York’s hardy cattlemen have
grown accustomed to failure. Some
have given up trying. But those who
have battled on over the years, strug-
gling with insufficient funds to de-
velop areas beyond their financial and
physical capacities, see new hope in
what the American money is achieving.
For the first time they are seeing what
their land can achieve if the money is
available for massive and rapid develop-
ment. As a result, Cape York Peninsula
will never be the same again.
The Australians who are managing
the American properties have exploded
too many old beliefs, introduced too
many innovations. But in a sense the
American money has brought frustra-
tion as \Vell as achievement. This is
because it has proven, once and for all,
that huge quantities of capital are neces-
sary to adequately develop Cape York
and similar regions of Australia’s North.
Buying or leasing a property is barely
a start. The seven stations managed by
Sir William Gunn and his management
group on the Peninsula cost their
American leaseholders only $1 million.
But in less than twelve months they
have spent an additional $2 million on
basic improvements. And this has
barely skimmed the surface. One sta-
tion alone (admittedly of 2.8 million
acres) will have had close to $1 million
spent on it by the end of the year
and all this will have gone into fencing,
bores, dips, and homestead accommo-
dation. In other words, this expenditure
has been necessary simply to bring the
land under Man’s control. Huge addi-
tional sums will be needed to develop
the property.
,r pHE Americans have this sort of
money; Australians have not. It is
regrettable, but true. And in the absence
of sufficient capital to develop the North
ourselves, we must be grateful for
American capital and do our best to
match it, where possible, with our own.
It would be foolhardy to let the old
catch-cries of “foreign ownership,” “sell-
ing our birthright” and “subdivision” in-
fluence our attitude to foreign partici-
pation in northern development. These
cries are seldom heard in the North
itself, where the lack of adequate capi-
tal is recognised as the biggest bar to
development.
It must be recognised also that Aus-
tralia is not selling its North to foreign
interests. The land controlled by foreign
capital is leasehold and can thus be re-
sumed for subdivision or redistribution.
And it forms a small portion of the
total. (Claims that Americans now con-
trol the whole of the cattleland on Cape
York are typical of these uninformed
exaggerations. At present American in-
vestors control only one-seventh of the
Peninsula’s cattle lands.)

ing huge areas of our North held by
Australians if they are unable or un-
willing to do anything with the land.
Australia and Australians in general
benefit from the opening up of the
North, with all the resulting bonuses in
the way of more developed land, more
jobs for Australians, more export
potential, etc.
Foreign control has not always been
a good thing in the North. Some
absentee owners have sought a quick
profit, with disastrous results. But Aus-
tralians have been equally guilty in
this regard. Much of the blame must
rest on the authorities who have
allowed these money-grabbing or lag-
gardly owners to ill-use or waste their
leaseholds.
'J'ODAY, with a burgeoning interest in
Northern Australian beef, there is
little risk of the mistakes of the past
being perpetrated, provided Federal and
State authorities are alert. Today North
Australian cattle leaseholds can be
acquired for 20 cents an acre, and less.
This day will not last for long. As Aus-
tralian and American capital, backed
by Australian management, reveals the
North’s potential, the clamor for land
will grow deafening. And that is when
the authorities will have to resist de-
mands for too massive and too early
subdivision if disaster is to be avoided.
It is one thing for a big company or
a multimillionaire to develop 2 or 3
million acres, but it is vastly different
for an individual, however good a
cattleman, to get a profit, out of half a
million acres with only bank and Gov-
ernment financial backing. Eventually
some alteration in the system of land
tenure may be necessary to encourage
foreign and Australian interests to de-
velop unwanted portions of their lease-
holds for subdivision. It might be feas-
ible, for example, for leaseholders to
convert portions of their leases to free-
hold if they' handed over a comparable
area fully developed for subdivision.
From what I have seen, most of the
overseas money which has come into
Northern Australia in the past few years
has been well spent. It and the opening
up of the American market for manu-
facturing beef have been the two vital
factors in what looks like becoming a
bright new future for the northern beef
industry. After an on-the-spot inspection
I can see no objections other than
purely emotional ones —against worth-
while foreign participation in the
development of the North. If we want
our North opened up and made produc-
tive, we must welcome increasing
amounts of foreign capital, because
tory has proved the task beyond our
own limited resources.

MAN ON THE LAND
Subsidies after the Elections
WITH the elections, which seemed
more a referendum, out of the
way, the policy in Australian
farming generally would appear to be
to soldier on. Nevertheless, things may
not be quite the same. While the
Liberal-Country Party coalition must
remain strong, it will be evident that
the big winner in the election was the
Liberal Party. A study of returns, com-
pared with the previous election, indi-
cates that the Turks of the Liberal
Party did best of all.
The most remarkable personal effort,
to our mind, came from Mr. lan Haw-
kins, who was not a winner at all. But
to run Dr. Cairns so close, in what has
always been the epitome of a Labor
electorate, is a startling indication of
how young Australia is thinking. How
pathetic and wrong was the obviously
sincere belief of Mr. Calwell that, be-
cause he had the folkies and beats at
his meetings, youth was on his side,
This election revealed the growing
aspirations of the young, middle-class
suburban voter and in this there is a
clear message for the man on the land.
The Government, we think, will be more
clearly aware of the burden of taxation
on middle-class, under-40 people beset
with the problems and costs of raising
children and establishing homes. One
of the reasons the tax burden falls so
heavily on this segment is unquestion-
ably the farm subsidy and support sys-
tem.
Wool promotion and research is in
the clear. Surprisingly, Mr. Holt made
the increased Government contribution
an election promise. It does not surprise
us that the Government came to the
party, but the speed with which it hap-
pened staggered us. We expected it to
come around January, just before the
Wool Industry Conference which will
decide the rate of grower levy. The
opponents of promotion have little
chance now. Most woolgrowers, now.
that the Government is going 50-50,
will let things stand.
It is not surprising, either, that the
Government is going to increase the
funds for extension to about $5 million
a year. Likewise, we did not think this
would come so soon. The fact is that
no one, in the Government or out of it,
has any clear idea of just how the
money will be spent. There is a strong
suspicion that extension could turn into
a vehicle for employment rather than a
boon to farmers. It is up to the aca-
demics to sort out their differences and
to show that they can use this money
with intelligence.
B UT academics are voters, too, of
course, and providing this money
was something of a master stroke on the
part of the Prime Minister, who must
have known that the shadow Labor
farm policymakers were steering clear
of extension. The growing army of
aspirant Ph.D.s, who might have been
inclined to swing, probably voted where
their bread and butter was to be found.
The figure, $5 million, is a nice round
sum, large enough to ensure that the
plans will see the light of day, but not
large enough to anger all the North
Shores.
The subsidy which does appear to
be in for a difficult time is the $26
million provided for dairying. We did
not hear the PM mention this one,
although in rural electorates some Gov-
ernment members told farmers that the
Government would be prepared to con-
tinue it if returned. The Dairy Industry
Council, which is the accepted voice of
dairy farmers, has asked, not for an
increase, but continuation. The Aus-
tralian Primary Producers’ Association,
which claims to speak for a majority
of dairy farmers, wants the subsidy
increased to $6O million.
Dairying, through the margarine and
Mrs. Jones controversy, has been getting
a lot of criticism on the score of
efficiency lately. It is not nearly as
inefficient as some of the critics claim,
but there are some bad pockets. The
Dairy Industry Council acted with
restraint and candor in seeking, not a
massive increase, but continuation at the
existing level. It has asked for some

WINE
ONE OF A SERIES
Oak from the forests of Nevers in France has for centuries
played a major part in establishing the reputation of
famous French dry reds. This same oak is imported by
Yalumba to make 100 gallon puncheons to mature the
prize-winning Galway Vintage Claret and Yalumba
Burgundy. After two years quiet maturity in these oak
casks the wine is bottled and laid down in huge bins in deep,
cool cellars to reach their peak of bouquet and flavour.

additional things, principally loans at
favorable terms of interest (that means
around 3 percent) to enable expansion
of efficient farms and modernisation of
factories (co-op. owned).
The re-negotiation of the dairy sub-
sidy, which will begin soon, will test
the coalition. Our view is that the
Dairy Industry Council requests have
a much better chance of being met than
the APPU demands.
One of the imponderables which the
Government must begin to consider
seriously is the way in which all the
subsidies, supports, and loan provisions
appear to assist those who are already
in possession, rather than those starting
out. If young Australians are not tak-
ing up farming it is not because they
do not want to. All the State land
settlement commissions have long wait-
ing lists. True, the young are not pre-
pared to go into the wilderness with axe
and gun and little else. The brawling,
hungry, desperate landtakers belong to
the 19th century.
Today, unfortunately, capital is re-
quired (and the truth is it always was,
up to a point) and very few people
young enough to take on farming have
any hope of getting sufficient capital.
There is likewise little hope of raising
capital for farming enterprise from
among the young, middle - income
groups. Few can save capital.
Farming, either as an investment or
as an occupation, is a long-term busi-
ness. So it looks like the Americans or
no one. And that is what is happening.
Labor’s views on American buying of
Australian farms are either incoherent
or emotional. To hear some of the
old stalwarts speak one would think the
Irish immigrants were on the march
again at Kangaroo Flat. Realism is
needed.
ONE of the startling gaps in Austra-
lian academic thinking is land pur-
chase and tenure. Farmers are told
they are inefficient by dozens of ex-
perts in dozens of ways. They are
given advice on all aspects of farm-
ing except the most basic of all
how to obtain a farm.
It is because of a passive accep-
tance of the trend to big corporation
farming - big Government alliance,
which, if unchecked, eventually must
lead to a revision of ideas on land
ownership. In our mind the answer
is quite simple—permit a generation
of more capital in Australia to cater
for Australian enthusiasm and ambi-
tion, which does exist (go-go and
Opera Houses notwithstanding).
General Moshe Dayan, in his re-
markably illuminating articles on Viet-
nam in THE BULLETIN recently,
mentioned that it costs about $35 to
set up a family on the land in Viet-
nam, about $lOOO in Israel, and about
$6OOO in Venezuela. What is the
figure for Australia? We would say
$20,000 bare minimum. About $40,000
would be more realistic: It is not
a very healthy trend and it could be
corrected by a clear determination of
priorities.

Pigs Ready for Take-off
PIGS is pigs scarcely any longer.
Pork and bacon production is
presently facing great change. Pig
raising is now where the broiler busi-
ness used to be ten years ago, i.e., it is
becoming an industry in its own right
rather than continuing as a sideline
identified usually with dairying.
Soon the people who compile the
Commonwealth Yearbook may give pigs
a separate entry instead of listing the
production figures in the dairying
industry section. The latest Yearbook,
incidentally, shows that Australia has,
at any one time, nearly million pigs.
The great majority of these occur in
the three eastern States, Queensland,
New South Wales, and Victoria. The
distribution of the pig population, in
fact, coincides fairly closely with the
density of the rural human population.
The map may look different in a few
years’ time when pig production may
have moved out of the more closely
settled dairying districts to the broader
acres of the grain belt.
Agricultural research is not ringing
this change, but the inexorable march
of economics. This broad conclusion is
apparent from data compiled by Mr.
H. A. White, of the Agricultural
Economics Branch of the Victorian
Department of Agriculture.
from confirming that food is
by far the most important cost in
pig-meat production, his “Pig Manage-
ment Study” focuses attention on the
fact that skim milk is now much too
valuable to feed freely to pigs. As a
protein supplement it is worth about
four cents a gallon. And a gallon of
skim has about the same food value
for pigs as one pound of meatmeal,
which costs the same.
The world is now hungering for skim
milk powder to feed the spiralling
human population. Its value, there-
fore, is likely to rise even higher yet
in the near future. Moreover, it is
difficult to manage a piggery so that
its efficient consumption of liquid skim
milk matches the production of the
concomitant dairy herd. Efficient con-
sumption is when the intake of skim
by the piggery does not exceed 10 per-
cent of its total feed needs. More
precisely, piglets from weaning to pork
weight should get | gallon of skim per
day, porkers and baconers half a gallon,
dry sows one gallon, and nursing sows
two gallons of skim per day.
Clearly, careful planning and com-
plicated implementation in practice is
required to maintain such a strict
dietary regime. Too often pigs on dairy
farms are subjected to feast alternating
with famine. Frequently they are given,
profligately, two to three times their
daily protein needs in the form of
skim milk. At other times there is in-
sufficient skim available and the pigs,
suffering accordingly from lack of pro-
tein, do not turn into meat at a profit-
able rate, or the farmer has to dip into
his pocket to bring on to the farm a
protein supplement. In addition, there
are other difficulties associated with
skim-milk feeding. Hygiene is a
problem. Losses by spillage and other
waste are hard to avoid. Milk exposed
in troughs quickly goes bad in the hot
weather and the pigs won’t eat it—or
any solid feed which may have been
mixed with the milk.
On the other hand, meatmeal is
readily storable and transportable. It
makes better sense now to locate a
piggery close to a source of grain rather
than protein. For economic feeding,
grain should comprise nearly 90 per-
cent of the total diet. Where freight
charges are low, grains may be fed to
pigs for as little as two cents per pound
—which is just half the price of skim
milk. Whether to feed wheat or barley
depends mainly on the landed cost of
each at the piggery. Mr. White has
calculated, taking into account the
relative feeding value of these two
grains, that when barley landed at the
piggery costs, say, $1 a bushel, the
farmer can afford to pay up to $1.20
for wheat. His formula for making this
decision is simply: price of wheat per
bushel divided by 43 is equivalent to
price of barley divided by 36. Obvi-
ously, the graingrower rather than the
dairyfarmer should be looking into the
question of producing pigs.
As this change becomes general, the
supply of meatmeal will be stressed.
Poultry farmers are the main consumers
at present. Fortunately there are alter-
native protein-rich feed supplements
that can be used. The Queensland De-
partment of Primary Industries has
already shown that imported South
African fishmeal, despite its apparent
high price, can be used profitably in
pig-feeding. Opportunity is said to
exist for the Australian fishing industry
to make a good quality fishmeal in
reasonable quantities if a suitable outlet
were available. But probably the demand
for a plentiful, cheap, and good protein
supplement for pig and poultry feeding
will first stimulate the infant soybean
industry in Queensland and northern
New South Wales. Eventually, the
Darling Downs with its bean and grain
crops growing right beside each other
may become Australia’s pork barrel.
from the mean little
dairy farms, pig-meat production is
now poised to go. All it needs is a few
big-moneyed wheatmen or perhaps Pitt
Street “farmers” to kick it off and
fashion it into an independent industry.
Then it will attract the close attention
of scientists, economists, and all kinds
of schemers. Possibly the big meat
interests might organise vertically
integrated production owning the grain
farms, the piggeries, the processing fac-
tories, and all the people involved. Or
the farmers may get together first and
form co-operatives. The industry could
develop in two sections, with the
weaners being raised on the dairy farms
and the porkers and baconers being
raised in huge piggeries in the grain
belt. Like large-scale poultry units,
large-scale pig production has economic
advantages. A big piggery would be
costly to build, but if put in the right
place and managed shrewdly it should
make much money.


Chess Bulletin
By JOHN HARVEY
JOHN HENDRY
SYDNEY chess officials are becoming
very excited about the potential
of young John Hendry. He turned
15 in August and has staggered officials
and competitors with his knowledge
of chess theory, his natural ability and
his astounding improvement this year.
Hendry was taught the moves by his
father at the tender ag e of eight, but
did not take the game seriously until
this year. In the under-is section
of the N.S.W. Junior Championships,
held in September, he tied for first
place with Martin Fikler and then
lost the play-off.
His next tournament was one for
adults —the Sydney Chess Centre Re-
serves Tournament. On this occasion
he convincingly outclassed his rivals.
His effort in the Monster tournament
passed unnoticed. Having lost three
games, he was eliminated in the seventh
round. Most significant, however, are
the names of the three players who
beat him. They were A. Hidas, J.
Anderson, and A. 'Szirt.
His next and latest achievement was
the reserves tournament run in con-
junction with the N.S.W. State Cham-
pionship. Revenge was sweet. He
defeated Szirt, drew with Anderson',
and won the tournament a clear point
ahead of runner-up, Eddie Daroczy.
The following game provides an ex-
cellent illustration of Hendry’s prowess.
His opponent, Eddie Daroczy, was
runner-up in the State Reserves.

SPECULATORS DIARY
Seventh Annual Report
LADIES and GENTLEMEN: It is with considerable satisfaction that this
seventh annual report and accounts covering the 12 months ended November
30, 1966, are laid before you. As has been our practice in the past, every
effort has been made to present these accounts as quickly as possible. In this
regard, we are proud of our record both for this year and for previous years.
PROFIT: Directors are pleased to re-
port a profit of $1636. While the earn-
ing rate based on funds at the beginning
of the year is lower than in any of
the previous years, it was achieved under
most difficult conditions. This was par-
ticularly so in the second half of the
year, when the rate of profitability fell
away sharply. Unlike previous years,
the account generally carried a cash
balance. In view of the dull state of
the market, this was considered the
most prudent action. A consolation for
the disappointing market in the past
year is that it is now at its lowest level
for several years.
The history of growth of the diary
since it began seven years ago is shown
at right. An amount of $4OOO was the
starting sum in 1960. When the value
of the portfolio had grown to $27,210
in 1964 it was reduced to $4OOO again.
Directors think it unlikely that it will
reach $27,000 in the next five-year
period, although it will not be through
want of trying!
TRADING REVIEW: The most sig-
nificant observation of this year’s trad-
ing was the poor performance of in-
dustrial stocks. If those industrial
companies which had received takeover
offers are removed there is barely a
profit remaining. Fortunately, in this
year’s trading, F. W. Williams and
Cottees have not been overlooked.
A reflection of the industrial market
was the success of the Amalgamated
Chemical put option. After making
allowance for the cost of the option, a
profit of $132 was the result.
The mining market once again pro-
vided the thrills for the year. As was

the case with Renison Tin a few years
ago, the portfolio just managed to get
out of Western Mining before it began
its spectacular rise! Nevertheless, good
profits showed up on other mining
stocks, including Kathleen Investments,
Consolidated Rutile, and New Guinea
Goldfields.
The diary’s 1966 company award
goes to Woodside. Although neither
managing to come in at the bottom
price nor sell out at the top price, a
series of transactions in the stock re-
sulted in a total profit of over $4OO.
Not entirely for sentimental reasons
Woodside is in the present portfolio.
MARKET OUTLOOK: In the past
few weeks the diary has gone to some
length in giving fundamental reasons
for a sustained rise in the industrial
market in due course. Now that
Harold has triumphed, the air has
cleared for a quick rise before
Christmas. The market seems likely
then to mark time in the early months
of 1967. Barring a sudden change on
the international scene, and in spite of
the pessimistic views of the chartist
colony, a fairly smart improvement in
the index is then expected.
Time will prove that there are some
outstanding buys on the present market.
One could well be Pye. Already de-
pressed by the lower profit last fin-
ancial year, the share prices suffered
another jolt when it became known
that the parent company was having;
its troubles. But more of this next
week.
CONCLUSION: While it has gener-
ally been a trying year it has had its
exciting moments. On some occasions
it may appear that purchases have
been at bargain prices, but it must be
remembered that the diary relates to
transactions in the previous week. The
directors look forward to another
eventful year.

A little of this. A measure of that.
Hennessy cognac is a master-
blend of old brandies . . . drawn
from the largest and finest reserves
in the world. That’s why the subtle
excellence of Hennessy cognac
never varies.
And that goes back to when
Hennessy started distilling brandy
in the district of Cognac before
Napoleon was born.
Hennessy Cognac is distilled and
blended in Cognac. No Cognac
could be more French.

As a country on a map, we lie sprawled across the top half of
North America —nearly four million square miles—a land singularly
blessed by nature. As a people, we plan to celebrate our
100th Birthday in 1967 by inviting the world to share in
our Centennial festivities. In the beginning, our forefathers
came seeking wealth and a new way of life. First the
French, then the British. Separately they began to
explore and chart this vast and unknown land. Then, across a
conference table, they combined their strengths. That was 100 years ago
—on July 1,1867. Now we possess this land in common under the maple leaf,
symbol of the great forests we have hewn down together.
An equal welcome is extended to all who come —and millions have,
from many parts of the world, from many racial origins.
They have brought us hands and brains, skills and ideas.
They have helped us spread out over this enormous territory-
blessed with most varieties of climate and almost every natural
resource. Joined now by railways, highways, airlines and waterways
...and linked by radio, television and telephone networks.
We are bound together, too, by the knowledge—gained from
men and women of many races—that harmony nee.d not mean assimilation.
Today, we are twenty million Canadians, half of us less than twenty-
five years old. We are friends and next-door neighbours of
the United States. Our roots run back to overseas motherlands
but our loyalties are inseparably linked with Canada. A partner in
the Commonwealth, we are also a member of the United Nations, sharing its
burdens and aspirations. A land abundantly endowed—four thousand miles
wide—we believe in the wisdom of sharing our blessings with other
members of the human family. We are grateful to the past, invigorated by
our current progress, and inspired by the challenge of the years that lie ahead.
Already, Canada ranks as the third country to have a satellite in orbit.
Certainly 1967 finds us with much to celebrate.
Centennial Year will be a great and glowing festival. Nowhere will
the lights shine so brightly or so many people gather as at Montreal, where
a host of buildings and spectacles are rising to form a new-made
city of islands and lagoons. Here, from late April through
October, with 70 nations assisting us, we hope to make
our INTERNATIONAL EXHIBITION—EXPO 67—the largest, finest
WORLD'S FAIR ever held, and a true mirror of man's achievements.
Everywhere for our cross-country Centennial we are readying new events,
adventures, sights and sounds and places.
Things are happening in Canada...for us, and
for you. We hope you will come to share them.
