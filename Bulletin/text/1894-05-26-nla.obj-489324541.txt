“THE BULLETIN."
(Published at Sydney, N.S.W.)
The Unique Weekly—Australia’s Nonpareil
Illustrated Newspaper.
“Tli© Bulletin,”
Premier Australian Literary Journal,
Is the only paper which has a consistent and dis-
tinctive Australian National Policy.
The Bulletin favours—
A Republican Form of Government.
One .Person, one Vote.
Com ole bo Secularisation and Freedom of State
Education.
Reform of the Criminal Code and Prison
System.
A United Australia and Protection against
the World.
Australia for the Australians.; —The cheap
Chinaman, the cheap nigger, and the
cheap European pauper to be absolutely
excluded. ,
A State Bank, the issue of bank-notes to be a
State monopoly.
The direct election of Ministers by Parlia-
ment, instead of Party Government or
rather Government by Contradiction.
A new Parliamentary System - one House to
be elected by constituencies as at present;
the other to be chosen by the whole;
country voting as one Constituency.
A Universal System of Compulsory Life
Insurance.
The entire Abolition of the Private Owner-
ship of Land.
The Referendum.
The Abolition of Titles of so-called “ nobility, ’
The public eye rejects as uninteresting more
than half of what appears in the newspapers of
tlie day. It is only the remainder that is found
in The Bulletin.
The Bulletin is an aggressive Democratic
paper which strives to exclude from its artisti-
cally-condensed columns all matter* that is not
o! general human interest. The Bulletin was
started 13 years ago with no capital but brains,
and has become the representative Australian
journal, because it possesses-a vitality lacked
by the countless news paper-ventures in wljich
Australian capitalists have unavailingly spent
large fortunes.
The Bulletin’s conductors claim that every
progressive paper on the Australian,continent has
more or less endeavoured to profit .by its example
and follow its lines. The result of its powerful
influence and its unprecedented literary and com-
mercial success can at once be seen by comparing
the methods pursued by the Australian daily and
weekly press prior to and immediately after th
first issue of The Bulletin.
From the date of The Bulletin’s inaugural
publication its success was assured. It had at
once a dozen more or less servile imitators, many
of which even took, so far as was possible, its
name. They are now all dead, while The Bul-
letin continues the one phenomenal success in
Australian journalism, the one completely non-
local arid distinctly universal Australasian news-
paper.
The Bulletin proprietary have spent some
thousands of pounds in fitting their buildings
with the latest appliances for high-class printing
and the production of illustrations, and they have
now issued The Bulletin in an entirely new
form —printed with new type of improved legi-
bility on the finest paper, and adorned with
sketches from the hands of the ablest and best-
paid, newspaper artists Australia has ever seen.
The Bulletin is the only well established Aus-
tralian journal which, throughout its career, has
been consistently Radical. ' It points with pride
to the fact that for years it stood alone among
secular newspapers in advocating the Irish
National Cause, and that it was the only Aus-
tralian journal which denounced the Soudan
Expedition from its inception.
The Bulletin is the beacon-fire of national
progress: it is the forceful summons to the
crusade against the monopolies in land, wealth,
power, and privilege—the direct cause of half the
misery which now afflicts British humanity.
Against the clabns of avaricious clergy who claim
to monopolise salvation, against the dark despotism
of grasping plutocrats, and against the exercise of
any human authority which has not been granted
by the people over whom it is exercised, The
Bulletin will fearlessly and ruthlessly contend.
The Bulletin, unlike the ordinary weekly
journal, is not loaded with a weight of matter
transferred from the columns of a daily paper
issued from the same office. The Bulletin is
not connected with any other paper, and the
matter it contains is all specially prepared by its
own unequalled staff.
The Bulletin is the journal which, of all Aus-
tralian journals, is most frequently quoted in Eng-
land, America, and the colonies.
The Bulletin, which is the only paper sold
by runners in the streets of every Australasian
capital, is the most widely-circulated of all papers
published south of the equator, and is the only
Australasian publication which enjoys a popu-
larity unhampered by the political boundaries
that so closely restrict other journals to the
colonies in which they are printed.
The Bulletin’s red coveris equally familiar
to the bushman of the Far North, the stockman
of Central Australia, the pearl-sheller of Torres
Straits, and the digger in the Maoriland
Ranges. A paper which is at once the most
popular city publication and the organ of the
intelligent bushman must indeed be broadly based.
Perhaps the strongest proof of The Bulletin’s
popularity is found in the unchallengeable fact—
easily ascertainable from any postal official—that,
of all journals issued in Australasia, The Bul-
letin is the one most frequently remailed from
one reader to another.
The Bulletin is going ahead faster than any
other paper, because its vast mass of original and
specially-written reading matter is the brightest
and best, its illustrations (he cleverest and most
artistic, and its policy the boldest and most
straightforward ever submitted to the Australian
public.

With an ordinary tape measure determine the width
round the joints AA, round the instep 88, round heel CC,
round the ankle DD ; next ascertain the length and width
of tread by placing the foot on a sheet of paper, and
running a lead pencil round the heel and toes. Cut the
outline thus made with a scissors, and enclose with the
other measurements, stating what size you generally take.
What are your peculiarities—a weak ankle, perhaps a pet
corn, ingrowing nails, or a blooming bunion. All these
little matters attended to, if you have a long thin foot or
a short thick one, with very high instep, send to ELLjb o,
where you are sure to get a fit. The proprietor, with a
view of introducing his new and simple system into the
country districts where practical bootmaking is unknown,
has decided to supply his patrons at the lowest cash price.

No matter how far in the interior you reside, ELLIS’S

insoles of w'hich fairly bristle with tacks and other un-
comfortable impedimenta. All boots made on specially-
constructed lasts, giving the foot an an tr ®’rg

A German savant says that the red-backed
spider, common about Sydney, is the most
poisonous spider in the world. One twenty-
eighth of a grain of his poison injected into the
blood of a 12st. man would be fatal.
Some time ago a man living in a bush
township went to Melbourne for a week, lie was
a widower living in an isolated house of his own,
and he just locked up and cleared without saying
a word to anybody. Before he went, he lit his
fire and made a cup of tea, arid gnawed the last
remnant of flesh from an ancient ham-bone ; then
got on his horse, whistled to his dog, and rode toff.
Half an hour afterwards a log (that is the theory)
fell out of the fireplace and burnt the house, down
without anybody noticing it. Next day somebody
passed and saw’ smoke, and smelt fire, and reported
to the police. The police “ made enquiries,” and
found the man hadn’t been seen for several days.
So they searched the ashes and found the ham-
bone, and decided that the man had been too
drunk to crawl out of the way of the flames, and
the ham-bone was all that was left of him. They
iplaced'it on a sapling bier, and covered it decently
with a uniform coat, and carried it shoulder-
high to-the doctor, who, after putting some dex-
terous questions, identified it as the scapula of an
adult male about 274 years of age and sft. 7|in. high
(the man wasexactly 27^years of age and sft. 7f in.
high). Then a coroner’s jury sat on the ham-bone,
and returned a verdict of “ Suicide while of un-
sound mind ; ” and next day the ham-bone was
put in an elegant coffin, covered with flowers, and
followed bare-headed by several, townspeople to
the cemetery, where a minister made affecting
discourse over the solitary remnant of the departed,
and pointed out how the remainder of him was at
that moment soaring on muslin wings through
golden streets, where banana-peel never falls on
the pavement. Then the funeral party 1 ' proceeded
slowly homewards, and at the end of the main
street met the corpse just returned from Mel-
bourne. As soon as they-recovered from their
astonishment they told him he was a low liver,
and a drunken sot, and an atheist,, and presented
him with a bill for <£l2 11s. for his own funeral
expenses. He objected; but the ham-bone was
resurrected and placed in evidence against him,
and when he still refused to pay up the police
arrested him for personating the ham-bone under
the 163 th clause of the Elections Act. and he was
sentenced to six months’ imprisonment. Local
public feeling is dead against him, and when he
gets tout he will have to go to Coolgardie.

Dear BiftLhTiN,—A little practical experi-
ence of the London retail “ Australian Meat ”
trade. I left Sydney for England last October,
arid as we' found, on starting to keep house, that
mutttin-chops cost Is. 2d. per lb. our thoughts turned
towards “ Australian Frozen Meat,” the bulk of
which, by the way, is no doubt sold to the pre-
judiced British public as fine British meat at the
aforesaid Is 2d. per lb., for Australian mutton, as
such, is most difficult to get. After much seeking
I discovered the Leadenhall Meat-market a few
weeks ago, and there got a fine forequarter of
Australian lamb at 7jd. per lb. Freezing cer-
tainly had not spoiled that meat, for I had not met
with anything sweeter or better in England. We
kept portion uncooked for four days to test its
“ staying” powers, and found it quite as good at
the end of that time. I have been living at Chel-
sea—a thickly-populated district—where the very
poorest meat is ticketed lOd. On Saturdays,
about midnight, hundreds of people can be
seen waiting outside the various butchers shops
to rush the odds and ends left over, for which they
gladly pay from sd. to Bd. lam convinced that
much of this meat is Australian, but in deference
to the popular feeling it is sold as English-
grown, at lOnglish-grovvn prices. Loudon alone
could easily use treble its present consumption of
Australian mutton of good quality, but if the
growers wish to utilise the market, they must
organise a system of retail shops, otherwise the
present “ririg” of butchers, who are, of course,
coining money out of the business, will go on
deceiving the public. The chief reason why retail
buyers object to Australian meat is that the only
title they fancy they see it is when some inter-
esled butcher shows them some dried-up trash,
and blandlv states that it is a fine representative
spSmien of frozen meat from Australia. .The:
prewlice has been created, and will last until the
clean, Australian-managed, retail shops make their,
«»wei’uwMqp, und then good times will come both
for Australian growers and the meat-buying
British public. By the way, prawns of medium
size and with little flavour are sold here at Is. 3d.
per dozen! Could not these be easily and safely
shipped from Sydney to London to compete with
the presellt supply, wherever it comes from ? My
idea of the immense future before Australia is;
improving ’’every, week,—Dawson A. ViNDIN.

SATURDAY, MAY 26, 1894.
The Law “takes its Course.”
It has been formally decided, according to
the good old lag-time statutes of New South
Wales, that the law shall “ take its course”
in the matter of Montgomery and Williams,
the Sydney burglars. This historic phrase is,
in itself,*a serious reflection upon the law,
for whenever it “takes its course” some-
body is hanged as the inevitable consequence,
and when nobody is hanged it is only be-
cause the law has been violently arrested in
its gallop. Therefore, the natural course of
New South Wales law is obviously towards
the soaped noose, and the gallows, and the
stipendiary man-butcher. In the present
case, it seems likely, at time of writing,
that the statutes will go their blood-
stained way without serious remonstrance.
The two condemned men are not of the
kind who arouse much public sympathy.
They are' habitual criminals ; they ate
coarse, illiterate, badly-dressed, and alto-
gether uiuesthetic of aspect, their portraits
have been made to look gratuitously horrible
in the evening papers, and they have never
moved in “ society ” —all of which matters a
great deal. Altogether, nobody—not even
The Bulletin —takes the slightest real in-
terest in them personally. But this paper
takes a serious interest in the legal process
by which they have been tried and
convicted —a process which is yet another
commentary upon the blood-stained and
hideous code which Alfred Stephen, ex-
Chief Cpown Prosecutor of Yandemonia,
was mainly instrumental in fastening upon
the country of his adoption. It is a curious
coincidence, by the way, that the case of the
condemned burglars was tried before Mr.
Alfred Stephen’s son, who, judging from
the result; of his report, seems to have flouted
the jury’s recommendation to mercy in the
case of Williams.
• • •
The crime for Which these two exceedingly
uninteresting persons are condemned is
“ assault with intent to murder.” As every
sane man in the community is fully aware,
the assault was not committed “ with intent
to murder.” It was obviously committed
with intent to get away, and for no other
purpose whatsoever. The fact that the
criminals made no use of their revolvers is
one evidence of that fact ; another is that
when they had knocked down the available
“ force ” and could have murdered it with-
out difficulty, had they been so inclined,
they made not the slightest effort to do so.
When a person has an intent to commit
murder and gets the opportunity to do so
he naturally commits it; if he refrains
the reasonable assumption is that he
had not the intent. This fact is so
obvious that it has not even been seriously
disputed. But the gore-spattered code
of Botany Bay practically arrogates to
itself, or rather its administrators, under
certain conditions, the right to assume an
“ intent ” without any evidence whatever. A
certain illogical charge was formulated, and
the jury was requested to say, in one word,
whether the prisoners were wholly and
entirely guilty or wholly and entirely
innocent. The clumsy law, which New
South Wales dug out from the savage code
of England in its pre-civilisation days, cheer-
fully assumes that there can be no medium
between these two extremes.
* * •
In France, the United States, and various
other countries, the crime of murder is
divided into certain degrees, according to
the provocation given, the amount of pre-
meditation or the absence of premeditation,
and other attendant circumstances. There-
fore, the jury is not only enabled to say
whether the prisoner is or is not guilty,
but also, if guilty, how guilty he is,
and, within certain limits, to fix the
punishment accordingly. In barbarous
New South Wales the jurymen are merely
permitted to recommend the prisoner to
mercy. Then the Cabinet, sitting as a secret
tribunal, either adopts the recommendation
or otherwise, according to the state of its
liver or its “backbone.” The recommenda-
tion to mercy is intended by those who
make it to be as much an integral part of the
verdict as is the verdict itself. It is also as
solemn an expression of the j ury’s opinion as
is the verdict itself. Therefore, when the
Cabinet disregards such a recommendation it
deliberately puts it on record that it doesn’t
regard the jury’s opinion as sufficiently in-
telligent to be worthy of consideration.
Then it proceeds to execute the defendant,
and thereby deliberately puts it on record
that it regards the jury’s opinion as quite
sufficiently intelligent to hang a man upon ;
consequently the assumption is that it takes
much less intelligence co hang a man than to
spare his life. The whole proceeding is
nearly related to lynch-law and half-brother
to judicial murder. If the Government
arrogates to itself the right to accept one-
half of the jury’s verdict and reject the other
half—which is an equally deliberate expres-
sion of opinion—then it might as well dis-
pense with the jury altogether and find its
own verdict.
* * •
A recommendation to mercy is surely not
the empty formality it is commonly supposed
to be. The State, in this case, formally
charged the prisoners with assault and tacked
on to it an “intent ” of which there was no
good evidence. The jurymen, under the
pressure of overwhelming proof, necessarily
found the assault charge to be absolutely
true ; and the recommendation which they
attached to their verdict, in regard to
Williams, was practically the only method
which their oath, and the N.S.W. statutes,
and the evidence allowed them of stating
that they found the alleged “ intent ” to be
false. The Government, however, decides
to hang both prisoners on the first half
of the verdict, which is just about as
bad as hanging them on no verdict at all.
So long as the statutes are so built as to give
a jury merely the right to choose between
finding a prisoner wholly innocent —which is
generally a lie—or finding him wholly guilty
—which is often a lie also—a recommenda-
tion to mercy should be regarded as an in-
tegral portion of the verdict and acted on
accordingly.
» • *
The Cabinet’s decision that the law should
take its course was, in the present instance,
almost a foregone conclusion. The master-
ful Premier Dibbs, by a ghastly display of
political indecency,'practically judged the case
and found the prisoners guilty even before the
beginning of the preliminary inquiry. The
law holds—in theory—that every person is
innocent until he is proved to be otherwise ;
therefore, until Montgomery and Williams
were legally convicted, Premier Dibbs had
no legal evidence that any burglary had been
committed, or that there had been any
encounter with the police, or that anything
unusual had happened. Nevertheless, he
proceeded to the hospital immediately after
the fracas to compliment the police upon
their bravery, which then rested entirely on
their own statements, and to recommend
that they should be promoted and otherwise
rewarded for their valuable services—which
also thenrested entirely on their own evidence.
There are no valuable services rendered
when the police arrest the wrong men by
mistake, consequently Mr. Dibbs was simply
giving it forth as an indubitable fact that the
police had arrested the right men. Also,
there is no bravery in arresting a prisoner
who doesn’t resist, therefore Mr. Dibbs
declared by his proceedings that the accused
had resisted desperately. His action, at such
a time and under such circumstances, was a
public announcement that the assertions of
the police were absolutely true, and that any
counter-assertion or counter-evidence which
might be advanced by the prisoners was
absolutely false. In fact, the Premier almost
announced, a few hours after the arrest, that
the law ought to take its course, and his
present decision that it is to take its course
is, therefore, in most respects, a mere
formality.
* m
It is only when the case of Montgomery
and Williams is placed alongside two others
of recent date that the utter iniquity of the
law, and the still greater iniquity of its
administration, become fully apparent.
These two men did not seek the police with
a view to attacking them ; their crime was
not premeditated ; and their alleged “ intent
to murder ” is fully disproved by the fact
that they made no effort to follow up that
alleged intent when they had abundant
opportunity to do so. Nevertheless, the
law, in one of its blind, unreasoning out-
breaks of panic and blood-drunkenness, fixes
the “intent” on them, and sentences them
to the gallows for a mere impromptu scrim-
mage. The two Broken Hill constables who
recently attacked and slaughtered an aggres-
sive drunk, after he had ceased to be aggres-
sive, deliberately went in search of murderous
weapons, then followed up their enemy, and
shot at him persistently until they killed
him. Yet the law refused to regard all this
deliberate shooting at an unarmed man as a
sign of any intent whatever, and promptly
set them at liberty. In the case of Thomas
Pert, the “ push ” hunted for its victim
day and night, and killed him at the
first convenient opportunity, and in this
instance two of the assailants got a short
sentence, and the others were released. The
inference is, therefore, that, in New South
Wales, when several men deliberately pursue
and attack one and kill him, his death is
sufficient evidence that they didn’t intend to
kill him, and when three men have an un-
premeditated encounter with five or six, and
don’t kill any of them, that is solid evidence
that they did intend to kill them. The proof
that they did intend to do the crime lies in
their not doing it, and the proof that the
other lot didn’t intend to do the same crime
lies in the fact that they did it. The alterna-
tive inference is that the law is strained
in the case of Montgomery and Williams
because they had added burglary to their
other sins—that the alleged “intent to
murder ” is a hollow imposture intended to
protect the sacred interests of Property—
and that the law is to take its course,
not because of the midnight scramble with
the police but by reason of a brutal attack
on the Union S.S. Co.’s iron safe. The
truth lies between these two alternatives
and nowhere else, and the public is left to
select whichever one makes the law seem
less ridiculous or less loathsome in its own
eyes.
Stained Glass Window Education.
Chancellor Manning, of Sydney University,
ex-Supreme Court Justice of N.S. Wales,
recently “broke with reluctance a rule of 56
years’ standing ” and wrote to the newspapers
in protest against the withdrawal of part
of the endowment with which the Univer-
sity is assisted by Government. Such a
tremendous cataclysm of ex-judicial nature
obviously invites investigation, which discloses
the following facts :—Since 1851 the N.S.
Wales taxpayers have presented the University
with £714,877 10s. 6d in hard cash. In return,
the University has presented N.S. Wales with
1126 graduates. In 1892 there were 90
graduates for a total expenditure of £40,083,
or £445 per graduate. Salaries amounted
to £18,625, distributed among 44 professors—
an average of £423, each professor producing
two graduates and one twenty-secondth of a
graduate, at a cost of £206 per graduate. This
estimate takes no account of private benefac-
tions amounting to £409,000. If the students
be charged with 5 per cent, interest on a capital
of, say, £BOO,OOO sunk in the University, and
yielding no income available for direct expendi-
ture, which is only fair, wdien the institution is
regarded in the light of a valuable educational
investment, the cost of a graduate in 1892 was
£BB9. It is probably the consciousness that
they are dear at the money which impels the
undergraduates to throw in extra value in the
form of an annual display of larrikinism on
Commemoration Day.
• * •
•A few vreeks ago a Women’s College was
added to Sydney University. The building
cost £12,652 ; £5OOO provided by the Govern-
ment, and more asked for. With furniture and
fittings, the cost will be nearly £14,000. This
building accommodates 26 scholars ; there are
at present five. The descriptive reporters
expatiate on “ white lonic columns and pilas-
ters,” “richly-modelled frieze,” “vaulted wood
ceiling,” “ tiles of a rich peacock-blue,” and
“ massive hammered iron fire-dogs.” Assuming
that all the rooms are filled, and that each
scholar stays three years, the annual cost of
this (at 5 per cent, interest on £14,000) is £BO
per scholar. That does not include board or
education, so that the female University
graduate is in a fair way to be as expen-
sive as the male. Like him, indeed, she
has the advantage of stained-glass windows.
Stained glass windows are the University’s
strong point. It can only educate 90 graduates
up to its standards for an expenditure of
£40,000, but it has all the kings and queens of
England since the Conquest in gorgeous hues,
with many less notorious personages. The
stained glass window is the typical fruit and
consummation of Sydney University training.
The funds have been lavished oh buildings and
decoration, while the end of education has been
comparatively neglected. The University is a
splendid husk, but there is no fruit.
' The University is for the children of the rich,
not for the children of the poor. As a factoi
in national life it is singularly ineffective.
methods are obsolete ; its results are pitiable
It is out of touch with modern life ; it breeds
academic noodles whose incompetence excite?
the derision of men made in the mould of the
times. University education means wasted
years, unfitness for business and public work
the need to unlearn much that has been learned
toilfully in the heyday of youth. So far from
the State increasing the endowment of such an
institution, it should take avvay the endowment
it already gives Until it has complete control of
the endowment. What people want is not a
University for a wealthy, leisured class, but a
University for the people, free to merit, and
forming the crown of a complete State educa-
tional system. It is indispensable that the
University come in direct touch with the
people, and that its heads be directly respon-
sible to the people’s representatives in Parlia-
ment. At present the University taxes rich
and poor to benefit the rich alone. That is un-
democratic, inexpedient and unjust.
Burglars’ Law.
Ex-Premier Parkes has not forgotten the
days when he read law in J, B. Darvael’s
chambers; neither has he forgotten what
he learned there. His letter on the bur-
glars’ case points out, with judicial precision
the great mistake which has been made
in the trial and conviction of the men, the
result of which mistake is that, instead of
being sent to gaol for life or a term of
years, they are to be hanged by the neck
until they are dead. He also points out
that this mistake originated in the scare
which took possession of Sydney some months
ago, under the influence of which “ the enter-
prising burglar ” became magnified into a
criminal monster whose one object was to mur-
der everyone who stood in the way of his
burgling. But for this scare Montgomery and
Williams would, have been tried under a
section of N.S. W. Criminal Law Amendment Act
which was expressly designed to meet such
cases as theirs—that is, an aggravated assault
committed for the purpose of preventing arrest.
Their assault, however, had the effect of in-
tensifying the scare to such an extent that a
hysterical Government thought it necessary to
arm every constable with a six-shooter, and
to have the men tried on a capital charge.
They were accordingly indicted under a sec-
tion of the Act which does not apply to their
case at all. Let the reader examine the words
carefully, and the intention of the Legislature
will make itself evident
16. Whosoever administers to, or causes to be taken by>
any person, any poison or other destructive thing—or by
any maans wounds or causes grievous bodily harm to any
person— with intent in any such case to commit murder
shall be liable to suffer death.
* * •
The collocation of these words obviously
points to cases in which life is deliberately
aimed at, and in which the destruction of life
is necessary to effect the criminal object—if,
for instance, the burglars had killed some
person who resisted their- attempt to burglari-
ously enter premises. No one gives another
person a dose of poison, other than a temporary
narcotic, unless he wants to destroy his life,
either to obtain possession of his money or to get
him out of the way for other reasons. This being
the class of cases which the Legislature certainly
had in view in this section, it goes on to pro-
vide for cases in which a weapon is used instead
of poison. In either of these cases, unless it is
made to appear that the poison or the weapon
was used for the purpose of taking life,
the section does not apply. Had there been
no public panic at the time, the prisoners would
have been indicted under the 22nd section of
the Act, in which the object of the Legislature
is just as clearly expressed as in the other
case ;
22.—Whosoever maliciously by any means wounds, or
inflicts grievous bodily harm upon any person—or shoots
at any person, or in any manner attempts to discharge
any kind of loaded arms at any person—with intent in
any such case to do grievous bodily harm to any person—
or with intent to resist, or prevent, the lawful apprehen-
sion or detainer either of himself or any other person
shall be liable to penal servitude for life.
* * *
Under either of these sections the Crown
must prove the intent charged in the indict-
ment or the conviction cannot stand. Was it
proved in the present case ? There was no evi-
dence to prove an intent to commit murder,
but there was plenty to prove an intent to
resist or prevent apprehension. In the former
case the test is—was the taking of life necessary
to effect the prisoners’ object ? It was not, for all
that was necessary was to disable the constables.
The Judges in England have always held that
the intention to commit murder must be shown
to have been present in the prisoner’s mind at
the time of the assault. To take one case out
of many, in Regina v. Cruse (8 c. and p. 541),
when the indictment charged the prisoner with
having inflicted an injury dangerous to life,
with intent to commit murder, it was held that
the jury ought not to convict unless they were
satisfied that the prisoner had in his mind a
positive intention to murder, and that it is not
sufficient that it woidd have been - a case of
murder if death had ensued. So here, if the
constable had died from the wound, it would
have been a case of murder; but that is not
enough to prove the intent. t
PLAIN ENGLISH.
A Question of Taste.
A DAY or two ago a double-headed deputation
waited on the N.S. Wales Minister of Justice
re the case of Francis Abigail, of Australian
Banking Co. notoriety. One half of the depu-
tation wanted the prisoner released, asserting
that his sentence of five years’ imprisonment
was excessive ; the other half protested against
the proposed remission. The case for this
second deputation was, practically,’ that the
Australian Banking Co. was a premeditated
and utterly heartless fraud ; that the agitation
on Abigail’s behalf arose solely through his
political influence, and that if he had been a
person of no political influent he might have


been sentenced to ten years instead of five
without anyone putting in an appeal on his
behalf; and that there was not one redeeming
feature in the case to justify Government inter-
ference. This second deputation has come in
for much strong language from the “respect-
able” press, the Telegraph, in particular,
breaking out as follows :
The fact that the persons composing this body, or
sanctioning Us object in approaching the Minister, con-
sisted largely of sufferers through the collapse of the
Australian Banking Company, of which Abigail was chair-
man, lends air unpleasant aspect to its representations,
That many persons have suffered loss and bitter anxiety
through the frauds perpetrated in connection with that
defunct institution is true. But no rigour of punishment
that can now be visited upon those chiefly responsible for
what happened will mitigate this loss. The presence of
these persons on such an errand, or their declared
approval of it, is likely to be attributed to a spirit of
.revenge which the administrators of justice can hardly
approve.
Again :
The “ pound of flesh” deputation which waited upon
the Minister for Justice yesterday to protest against the
showing of any mercy td prisoner Abigail displayed the
spirit of anarcfiy in its crudest form. They had a per-
sonal grievance) against the man, and demanded that the
law should be administered so as to gratify their vindic-
tiveness rather’than to serve the public interest. Mr.
Bull, who appeared for the swindled shareholders and
.depositors of the society in connection with which the
Abigail fraud was committed—whatever they have to do
with the question of his sentence -was the only one who
bad good taste enough to be ashamed of his position.
His money was gone, he said, and torturing the now help-
less man who swindled him out of it would not make good
the loss.
This is poor logic. The deputationists
didn’t “demand that the law should be ad-
ministered to gratify their vindictiveness ”;
they simply demanded that the law, having
been already administered on an impartial basis
by an independent tribunal, shouldn’t be after-
wards interfered with through political pres-
sure. Their conduct might be in bad taste, but
the fact remains that they were upholding the
law, and it is a new thing to find the “ respect-
able ” press taking sides against the law’s up-
holders. Even in the matter of taste, however,
they followed a highly respectable precedent.
A few years ago a crowd of influential Sydney
citizens, hailing from the Exchange, brought
strong pressure to bear on Governor Carington
to prevent him granting a reprieve to the Mount
Rennie prisoners, and neither the Telegraph
nor the Herald made any allusion to their
“crude anarchy” or their “vindictiveness.”
These unspeakably brutal persons deliberately
urged the Governor, not merely to refuse a com-
mutation to a short-sentenced prisoner, whose
case can be reconsidered at any time, but to go
ahead at once with a wholesale hanging (ordered
at a trial, the brutality of which, as was
remarked by the late W. B. Dalley, could
only be paralleled in the darkest and
most bloody days of Irish history) and put
the matter beyond all further consideration.
On that occasion the ’ social influence was with
the party which demanded a general strangula-
tion, and the people to be strangled had no
social influence, so the Telegraph was silent;
in the present instance, the social influence
is with the man in gaol, and the people who
were defrauded by his “ bank ” are of no special
account in the community, so the Telegraph
rises to point out that the latter crowd are act-
ing contrary to the “public interest”—how
Abigail’s release would serve the public inter-
est isn't explained. Also, it complains because
itlie deputation was composed of persons who
ihad suffered greatly by the Australian Banking
■Co. swindle, and holds that to be an aggrava-
tion of their offence. Here, at least, the Mount
Rennie petitioners were free from blame ; they
had no wrongs to aggravate them, and for the
most part howled for the gallows from pure
bloodthirstiness and a natural yearning for blood
and butchery. Also—and on this point the
respectable organ comes out especially
strong —the money lost by the Abigail frauds
is gone, and no amount of torture inflicted on
the miserable prisoner can bring it back.
Which statement is undoubtedly true, not only
in this case but in every other, and if it is a
reason for the release of one influential ex-
politician it is also a reason for a general gaol-
delivery throughout the province. All the
money that has been stolen is gone, and all the
crimes that have been committed are done,
and no amount of imprisonment, or hanging, or
flogging will undo them. The Telegraph has
struck a solemn truth; the only pity is that
the truth didn’t strike it till a person of influence
belonging to its own especial political crowd
was concerned.
Insanity and Crime.
Dr. P. H. Todd’s lecture on “Insanity as a
Defence in Criminal Trials,” delivered before
Sydney Articled Clerks’ Association, was in-
teresting and unscientific. It halted between
the legal theory of criminal responsibility and
the scientific theory of general irresponsibility.
Conventional morality, as embodied in law,
punishes crime in the individual; although, so
far as the individual is concerned, vice and
virtue are scientifically equal. It is no merit
in the agent to do good, no sin to do evil. Only
the influence of his acts upon others confers
their ethical quality. In his relations to him-
self every man is an effect; in his relations to
society he is a cause. A logical doctrine of crime
and punishment can only take into account the
individual as a cause. Social praise and blame
have no basis except as stimulants to future
action. They are influences which help to shape the
individual to the mould of society. The punish-
ment of crime, in the ordinary meaning of
punishment, has no justification. The criminal
is the product of causes over which he has no
control; he falls as inevitably as the apple falls.
The judge who imprisons him, flogs him, hangs
him, is, as an individual, just as guilty as he
is. Guilt only comes to the member of a
society. The criminal whose crime hurts none
but himself, and influences none but himself,
is no criminal. Punishment is only justified in
so far as it prevents future crime ; and the
conventional reprobation of crime has no
better footing. Thus, scientifically, the man
who is normally sane and the man who is
palpably insane stand on exactly the same
ground of responsibility. The question of what
shall be done with them is merely a question
how best to make them innoxious to society.
If it is just to imprison them, it does not matter
whether the place of imprisonment is a gaol or
an asylum. If it is wrong to hang the lunatic,
it is equally wrong to hang the sane criminal,
unless it can be shown that he is a greater
danger to society. But these conceptions are
still far ahead of the popular sense of jus-
tice, though that sense is gradually being
elevated in the light of science. A century
ago, lunatics were hanged with the rest; even
now, had “ Jack the Ripper ” been caught red-
handed, his madness would not have saved him.
Deeming was sexually insane ; but that did not
lessen the cry for his blood. Colston was in-
sane—and they hanged him. O’Farrell was
insane—and they hanged him. Dr. Todd
wishes to widen the present legal definition of
insanity, which is doubtless desirable and right.
But in proportion as the definition of lunacy is
widened the liberty of lunatics must be
narrowed. A man’s sanity or insanity makes
no difference in his criminality, and the punish-
ment should depend on the danger which he
focuses as a direct or indirect source of future
crime. Medical evidence must not be inter-
posed as a shield from the consequences of
social guilt.
That profoundly dull personage, R. Hoddle D.
White, of N.S. Wales Legislative Council,
writes to S.M. Herald to demand that the
jury’s recommendation, to mercy in the case of
the Sydney burglars, Montgomery and Wil-
liams, be disregarded, and that they be hanged
for “ intent to murder.” As a reason for this,
Hoddle tells over again, for the hundredth
time, the well-advertised yarn of his own
valour when he met a gory bushranger at some
remote spot about 20 or 40 years ago. Every-
body has heard this story over and over again—
for Hoddle even drags it in at public meetings
of bank shareholders. This time he solemnly
pastes his experiences on the gallows, and inci-
dentally uses the two condemned men as a
personal advertisement—thus :
There are few men in New South Wales who have had
better opportunity, from personal experience, of judtfimj
about this matter and of marking the dire effects result-
ing from a misplaced clemency in the case of certain
criminals. I take the case of Lbb's gmg who stuck up
Mr. Miller and self at Denitiquin, in 1858 or 9. Catching
us unarmed as we left the dinner-table, they rushed us,
put loaded revolvers to our heads, actu dly shaking
against our skins ; and, judging from their conduct, it
was only a miracle our lives were not taken. For this
offence Lee and Drew received 12 years’ imprisonment,
the two others less, Judge Wise informing them they
had narrowly escaped the death penalty. While in
the gaol in Goullmrn they nearly escaped by
tunnelling through the wall ; being removed to Cocka-
too, they immediately instigated the well - known
riots there ; being removed to Berrima, Lee was
sentenced to death for the murder of a constable.
While in Darlinghurst Gaol he threw the warder over the
balcony of the corrider, almost killing him and crippling
him for life. Had capital punishment been inflicted in
the first instance, all this career of crime and murder
would have been avoided. On another occasion, when
assisting the police to capture a desperate ruffian in
Queensland, the man, at close quarters, threw three-parts
of a brick at my head totrv and brain me but, fortunately,
it just glanced off my shoulder as I rushed forward and
captured him. Again, I was attacked by five bushrangers
and fired upon at close quarters. These are only a few of
my experiences whilst gold-buying and conveying bank-
money about in the different colonies.
“Only a few!” The Bulletin strongly advises
Mr. Hoddle White, who has been pursued by
so many shockingly bad shots, to publicly get
the rest of his many penny-dreadfuls off his
chest and have done with them finally. Not,
however, that anybody wants to see them in
the newspapers. The hero might have them
advertised on the tombstones of the Bridge-
street burglars.
Sydney Truth, supposed to be chiefly controlled
by Premier Dibbs’ bosom friend, Nicholas
Willis, M.L.A., professes to give an account
of how the head of the N.S.W. State decided
uponthehanging of Montgomery and Williams
(the italics are Truth’s) :
When the Colonial Secretary read the two statements,
he said, “Damn it, Montgomery is a Man, and I'd be glad
of an excuse to spare his life ; but the Law is definite, and
the circumstances of the case show no extenuating cir-
cumstances sufficient to warrant Ex cutive interference.”
With regard to Williams’ abject appeal, the Colonial Sec-
retary was equally emphatic—“ As to the other cowardly
animal, he is not even loyal to his colleague in crime and
adversity. He says he is a child of God, and therefore ”
(tossing Williams’ statement on one side) “ I think the
best thing we can do is to send him home to his father
with as little delay as possible.”
The Bulletin has waited some days since this
statement was published in the expectation of
hearing that Mr. Dibbs, President of the New
South Wales court of final appeal in the case
of condemned criminals, had risen up and in-
dignantly refuted the foregoing gross slander.
As no such information has arrived, however,
it would almost appear that Premier Dibbs is
countenancing Truth’s defamatory assertions.
If the picture is true, then Premier Dibbs, in
his capacity as arbiter of life and death, and
sayer of smart things, is indeed an unpleasant
spectacle. As head of the final court of appeal,
civilised men expect him to consider cases,
especially capital cases, seriously and solemnly.
His pal’s paper represents him, instead, as
considering them by an airy process of damning
and throwing papers around, and attributes to
him a “blasphemous” joke, which would be
hissed down even at a sixpenny nigger-show.
The picture is ghoulish and wholly disgusting.
Let us hope, for the credit of humanity, that it
is altogether malicious and false.

The Sydney Telegraph wants to have Francis
Abigail released on the ground that the money
which disappeared in his awful “ bank ” is gone
past recovery, and nothing is to be gained by
torturing him further. How does this apply to
the case of Sweetman, the Mount Rennie cab-
man, who was sentenced to 14 years and two
floggings for taking a pavement-trotting girl for
a drive in his cab, said girl having afterwards
left the vehicle and come to more or less grief
among certain rowdy youths with whom Sweet-
man was not in league and for whose actions he
was in no wise responsible? That famous drive
and its after-consequences couldn’t be undone
by the hideous tortures to which the cabman
was sentenced, and it can’t be undone now by
a further continuance of those tortures. More-
over, The Bulletin defies any sane person to
read the evidence in Sweetman’s case and
find there any trace of a crime which, as
the world goes, merited more than a month
or two’s imprisonment—let alone fourteen
years and two floggings. Sweetman was
not dealt with like Abigail, in cold blood;
he was tried while Botany - Bay populace
and press were alike blood - drunk. The
last heard of him is that, previous to his
alleged crime, he had suffered from a cranial
injury which, of late years, developed into
paralysis, and has lately necessitated the sawing-
away of a large sample of his skull. Yet he
remains in prison all the same, and no big poli-
tical deputation demands his release to garnish
Victoria’s birthday ; and even the Telegraph
never once gets up to point out that another
seven years’ torture applied to this miserable
paralytic won’t undo one solitary item of that
bygone horror for which he was never respon-
sible in any reasonable sense of the word.
Barrister Want, who, while in N.S. Wales
Assembly, always acted as if he regarded politics
as a joke and a plaything, announces his inten-
tion of retiring from the House, and in doing so
curses, not himself, but Parliament, which, he
holds, is utterly and hopelessly degenerate. As
an example of its windy impotence, he points
out that in 1883 it met on 59 days, and sat
419 hours, against 116 days and 1096 hours in
1893, and yet the business record of 1883 was
far the better of the two. Mr. Want is wise,
though not especially candid, in selecting 1883
for purposes of comparison. In that year the
Legislature held three sessions, almost the
whole twelve months being fooled away in
prorogations; and it accomplished practically
nothing. In 1881, which would have answered
equally well for purposes of comparison, the
House sat for nine months ; in 1884 it sat for
eleven months, and so on. Ever since there
was a Parliament in N.S. Wales, in fact, it
has kept up a steady average of about nine
months’ talk per annum —barring the one year
which Mr. Want picks out to prove that it is
the Assembly and not himself that is a failure.
The strike and lock-out of Sydney bootmakers
had at least a plain and intelligible issue. In
three of four factories the men struck because
non-union labour was employed; in 20 others
the masters locked them out in order to defeat
the strikers. Each side was perfectly within
its rights. On the one hand, union must be
general to be successful, and in view of the
constant encroachment of employers the con-
dition of the men can only be raised by union ;
on the other hand, the man who refuses to join
a union, and the employer who supports him,
exercise their legitimate individual freedom.
Democratic sympathy goes naturally with the
men in their endeavour to establish co-operative
workshops, which have in the boot-trade, where
duties' are definite and routine exact, a very
good chance of success, provided the manage-
ment is able and unhampered. The monopolist
employer only justifies himself by succeeding ;
the sooner success can be attained without him
the better it will be for the community and the
better the community will be.
The latest from Paraguay is that Lane, the
founder, dictator, apostle, organiser and great
panjandrum of New Australia, has “chucked
up ” the bulk of his followers and the original
settlement, and gone off, with 40 or 50 others,
to found a superlatively beautiful colony of
their own. The alleged reason of the seces-
sion is that Lane’s crowd feel the neces-
sity for a “ higher moral tone ” than that
of the other lot, and their parting is said
to have been “ perfectly friendly.” Con-
sidering, however, the enthusiastic manner in
which the bosses at this end have denied every
unpleasant report until it was impossible to
deny it any longer, the public opinion of their
veracity is at a low ebb, and recent events
don’t point towards much cordiality. It is
only a few days since Lane and his party
were, it would appear, enthusiastically heaved
out of office by a majority vote of the com-
munity, and the sudden departure which
followed looks as if the same majority had
afterwards harried them from the settlement.
The “ moral tone” story sounds like the snuffle
of a (lefeated person with a huge black
eye sitting on an ant-heap in the wilderness.
The next trouble will probably be a civil war
between the moral tone party and the crowd with
no moral tone, and The Bulletin backs the im-
moral lot for all it is worth. People of high
moral tone are seldom any good in a fight.
Meanwhile, negotiations, or bricks, or some-
thing like that, are passing between the
two factions, and the third faction—the lot
originally ejected—are prowling round in the
old famished way and waiting for some-
thing to happen. Also, the crowd at this
end, who have been issuing so many stories
about the beautiful unanimity of the settlement
ever since everybody who wasn’t unanimous
was fired out, now say, as usual, that they have
been convinced for a long time that the split
was ‘ ‘ both expedient and right. ” They are all
going to join the superior lot, which is a beau-
tiful example of egotism, and a first-class advt.
for their own moral tone.
The retirement of Mundella from the Rose-
bery Government deserves to be noted and
remembered by Victorian electors in particular.
A Judge dropped some mildly unfavourable re-
marks upon Mundella’s connection with the
N.Z. Loan and Mercantile Co. and immediately
the solemn tribunal known as “British public
opinion ” decided that Mundella was unfit to
have a finger in the control of the Hempire.
Public opinion moves at the nod of Mrs.
Grundy, and these is no commanding place in
British politics for the man who has been
recently convicted of breaking Respectability’s
rnles. One sneers a little at the awful assump-
tion of virtue by Mundella’s press detractors,
one snorts at the popular indignation levelled
against the English legislator whose little sin has
found him out. Possibly the sin in this case
was very small indeed. Yet there is no deny-
ing that hypocrisy makes for purity by main-
taining a sham ideal of Ministerial honour. It
is a healthy kind of humbug which decrees the
casting forth of a Mundella, merely because
he had admitted his knowledge that he was
“directing” a scandalous!} 7 -managed company
by selling his shares on the quiet. Compare
this incident with the position of affairs in
Victoria, where public opinion is hopelessly
tainted, where a James Munro and a Graham
Berry held high positions in defiance of their
busted bank associations, and a James Balfour
still acts as mouthpiece for the blessed council
of churches ! Which political system is the
better for a country —the system of sacrificing
men to an extravagant pretence of national
honour, or that of abandoning every pretence
to national honour for the sake of a few old
identities ?

N.S.W. Full Court decided last week that a
publican has a lien on a lodger’s goods for credit
given, and that the lodger who takes away his
goods without paying his account steals from
the lienor. Chief Justice Darley, who had
tried a case involving this issue at Dubbo, re-
mitted the point to the Full Court. Judge
Innes, in concurring with Judge Windeyer,
who delivered the judgment, admitted that he
did so with much doubt; and Judge Foster,
also concurring, said he would not sanction hav-
ing a man arrested for leaving a hotel without
paying his bill. But, if he even takes a carpet
bag with him, he commits a theft against the
lienor, according to that judgment, and why
shall the publican be deprived of his right to
have him arrested ?
Westralia also is afflicted with the judge-
disease. At Perth Supreme Court, April 4th,
a man was charged with defrauding the Cus-
toms, and acquitted, to the obvious displeasure
of the presiding Judge, who, “ to express his
opinion of the verdict given,” refused bail—
though defendant had been out on bail for
three months awaiting trial! Two days later
he was arraigned on another count, and found
guilty. The Judge said that the evidence in
the first case was equally clear, and “he must
take that case into consideration in estimating
the penalty.” Then he fined prisoner £750.
On the presumption that the Judge held the
guilt in each case equal, defendant was thus
called upon to pay £375 for the privilege of
being declared innocent of the first charge
brought against him. Where does the jury
come in here ? Plainly, if the J udge can go
behind the verdict, and actually fine a man for
being acquitted, the jury isn’t worth a straw.
“ Divorce,” according to Victorian Chief
Justice Madden, “ should only be for meri-
torious people who have, for a long time,
endured wretchedness and misery.” The Bul-
letin invites the C.J. to stop just here and
look hard at his own logic. When he divorces
the meritorious person who has endured long
wretchedness and misery, doesn’t he also
divorce the unmeritorious person who caused
the wretchedness ? And is it not quite possible
that the latter individual gets as mucli satis-
faction out of the divorce as the former ?
Therefore does Mr. Madden want to fix
up a scheme whereby the plaintiff is divorced
while the defendant isn’t —which is much
the same as arranging a plan whereby two
people will stand near each other, only one
of them will be nearer than the other one—or
what does he propose ? Further, why should
it be necessary to endure wretchedness and
misery for a long time before the law inter-
venes ? Life is tolerably short altogether, and
when a long hunk of wretchedness is cut out
of it while qualifying for a separation, there
isn’t much time left to enjoy the blessed relief
which comes after. Also, why should the
law release only the meritorious person and
leave the person who wasn’t meritorious
in all her wretchedness, seeing that it professes
to protect all persons alike regardless of char-
acter ? And, in any case, if plaintiff isn’t
meritorious, there is always the possibility that
it is the long “wretchedness and misery”
which has reduced her to that condition, and if
the said wretchedness is lifted off she may
improve in course of time. The Bulletin’s
learned brother Madden proposes, in short,
only to divorce the person who suffers the
misery hereinbefore alluded to if she is
meritorious under conditions which would
undermine almost anybody’s merit, but he is
quite willing to divorce the person who causes
the misery whether he is meritorious or not.
He is profoundly anxious about the character
of the under dog in the scrimmage, but the
character of the upper one doesn’t concern him.
Mr. Madden’s law may be good—most probably
it is—but his loose eloquence is a dreadful thing
to read or to listen to.
A “silvertail” Women’s Franchise League
has now been formed in Brisbane, the members
whereof visibly shudder when the original
vulgar league is incautiously mentioned. The
cause in Brisbane, however, has received a bad
knock from Mrs. T. W. Foot, the poetess,
about the best representative of female culture
in Queensland. Mrs. Foot has actually said
that she doesn’t want a vote, and she thought
that a woman had quite enough to do in mind-
ing her home and family without joining the
ranks of political blatherskites. On the point
that women were wanted to improve the
moral tone of politics, she told the hor-
rified suffragists that male politicians were
moral enough, and if they weren’t immoral
men were no good as rulers, anyhow. Then she
quoted Scripture to show that Eli, a highly
moral man, had lost the ark of the Lord —the
worst calamity which ever befell Israel; while
David, a highly immoral man, made an excel-
lent king. Then she went to history, and
showed that Charles I. was moral, and yet it
wasn’t safe to leave him his head. And she
wound up with a general panegyric on men;,
whom she declared were very good to women,
and if they weren’t whose fault was it ?
whereat the assembled suffragists dispersed
howling.
You can always judge a country by the candi-
dates it keeps. Here follow a few extracts
from the election address of one Edward
Hamersley to a Westralian constituency :
I shall always advocate State aid to the Christian
churches. A country without a faith would be an
'anomaly in civilisation. The precepts of Christianity,
divine in their superiority to the beliefs by which they
had been preceded, after nineteen centuries of trial remain
intact and unassailable ; and these nations by which they
have been adopted appear to have been specially favoured.
. . .. The presence in a State of anarchists, nihilists,
atheists, demagogues and skunks generally, does not
appear absolutely essential to its welfare; and, personally,
I should offer no objection to their migration to an
Elysium of their own, provided it be as nearly under the
equator as possible, under the impression that a modifica-
tion of their views would be represented by the possible
survival of the fittest. I am opposed to a land-tax;
under existing conditions it would. be the nt plus
ultra of fatuity. The great railw’ay companies and
the Government hold some twelve millions of acres

of land through which their lines run, surely even
the howling political agitator can scarcely suppose this
land is to be brought into play by the present population
of the colony. Such a tax would be a bar to the intro-
duction of capital and its investment in that direction,
and it would be a drag on the efforts of the unfortunate
land-owner whose capital and credit are, as a rule, in-
vested in Improvements—a tax cruel and unjust, worthy
of a writer who appears to have escaped the gallows, and
his disciples. ... I am opposed to payment of
members. To me the phrase appears to a not very
qualified extent, to be synonymous with payment of
scoundrels. I have no wish to see our Parliament rushed
by men of shady antecedents, leeches seeking to attach
themselves to the political body for the sake of the
emoluments of office, men of rant and cant, blatant and
flatulent; contrast the work of those of their order who
have sought notoriety in print, with the work carried out
without their assistance or advice by the Forrest Ministry
and the true friends of the colony. On the one side you
find an anxious desire to promote the welfare of the
colonists, on the other a pitiable exhibition of mis-
chievous folly.

The utter incompetence of the first generation
of Australian “ statesmen ” is glaringly shown
by the way in which they have muddled the
land question. With a country landlordless,
with a free hand for political agrarian wisdom,
with the knowledge that haphazard aggression
methods have ruined empires, with the curse
of English and Irish landlordism before their
©yes, they have deliberately woven the web of
private ownership over the land, until the
only brisk business of the country is the dis-
traint auction-room, and the mark of the beast
in the shape of “ ejectment ” notices is as com-
mon on the doors as the “ board and lodging ”
cards in the windows. The fatuity of their
action is remarkably shown in the case of C. G.
Duffy, a whilom rebel against the curse of
English landlordism in Ireland, and the first to
sow the dragon seed of Australian landlordism
n Victoria. One is inclined to think that
inch men, deliberately plotting to secure the
guin of their country, looked over lazar-houses,
a nd, seizing with avidity the most hideous
c ancer they could see, inoculated our young
oountry with the landlord system.

The British nation is weeping tears of joy at a
new lie now going the round of the “ loyal ”
papers:—
One day while walking with one of her ladies in the
quiet lanes near Sandringham the Princess of Wales met
an old woman weeping bitterly and tottering under a load
of packages. On inquiry it appeared that she was a
carrier, and made her living by shopping and doing
errands in the market-town for the country people. “ But
the weight is too heavy at your age,” said the Princess.
“ Yes. You’re right, ma’am. I’ll have to give it up, and
if I give it up, I’ll starve. Jack carried them for me—my
boy, ma’am." ‘‘And where is he now? ” “Jack! He’s
dead 1 Oh, he’s dead! ” the old woman cried wildly.
The Princess, without a word, hurried on, drawing her
veil over her face to hide her tears. A few days later a
neat little cart with a stout donkey were brought to the
old carrier’s door. She now travels with them to and fro,
making a comfortable living, and never has been told the
rank of the friend who has tried to make her life easier
(or the sake of her dead boy.
This is the sort of thing by which the British
monarchy, like all other monarchies, is shored
up. Perhaps it is true, perhaps it isn’t; most
likely it isn’t. Anyhow, it does no particular
credit to the Princess, and is, if anything, an
argument for the abolition rather than for the
perpetuation of lords, kings, queens and
princesses, who, like the fuli-phylacteried and
well-advertised Pharisees of old, make their
pompous offerings. Reason agrees with re-
ligious-sentiment in singling out as the one
woman for praise, the widow who gives the
mite representing a real sacrifice. If the
Princess of Wales ever did give any old woman
“ a neat little cart with a stout donkey,” she
did not thereby abridge her own comforts and
pleasures by one hairbreadth ; and, therefore,
in the eye of God as of _ democracy, her gift
wasn’t worth talking about in the papers.
The professional staff of the Yic. Public
Works Department has been reduced by retrench-
ment from 50 to 14 men.
It is understood that Mr. Edward Pulsford,
late N.S.W. Freetrade League secretary, wrote
the recent manifesto of the N.S.W. Land-owners
Defence League.
The Bulletin reads that the support of
the Sydney Anti-Humbug League will be given in
Gipps Ward to Dan. O’Connor as against Black.
The irony of it ! An “ Anti-Humbug ” League
Supporting Dan. O’Connor!
The N.S.W. Industrial School authorities
are, it is stated, quite sure that the little girl on
whom the recent mysterious stone-throwing at
Enmorehas been fastened is not the true culprit.
She has, as per her confession, had her little
innings of pebble-throwing; but she, it is almost
certain, did not commence the business until the
windows of the house had all been broken by
someone else, and she could not possibly have
thrown the heavy stones. This opinion is strongly
concurred in by an eminent surgeon who has
examined the girl.
The S.M. Herald objects, in the strongest
Lading article which it knows how to write, to
a bill introduced into N.S.W. Assembly by
Dowel, M.L A. The object of this measure is to
alter that section of the criminal law under which
Montgomery and Williams are to be hanged for
an assault on the police, and the Herald holds
that the occasion is “ inopportune,” and that if
Dowel wants the law altered he should wait until
these men are hanged. Otherwise, his conduct
is unjustifiable “interference,” and looks as if
it was meant to save the condemned burglars from
the gallows. How would the same logic have
looked if applied to Dibbs’ Bank Issue Bill, sup-
ported by the S.M. Herald, which was rushed
through in the days of the panic? If Dibbs
waited the law altered on that famous occasion
he should have waited until the four remaining
banks burst and had their assets liquidated, like
ordinary insolvents; before moving. As it
was, his conduct was an unjustifiable inter-
ference, and looked as if it was intended
to save the banks from destruction. In each
Instance it was proposed to alter the law hurriedly
to fit one particularly case; the Herald approves of
this most cordially in the case of the bank, and yet
it disapproves cordially in thecase of the burglars.*
The principle is exactly the same, the only differ-
ence is that the Herald adores Property and sets
no value on the lives of common people.

A faint odour of tired-out cynicism per-
vades Sydney Lyceum where “Lady Winder-
mere’s Fan ” is in possession. Oscar Wilde’s
famous play is a curious and lop-sided production.
His characters are mostly of high rank; among 14
people—leaving out a maid and two flunkeys—
there are three lords, five assorted “ladies,” and
one duchess. One young lord and his very young
countess are fresh and good and pure of soul; the
rest of the crowd are the most exhausted-looking,
battered, and worn-out lot on record. They lie
round wearily amid much costly furniture, smoking
cigarettesand blastingotherpeople’scharacters, and
uttering that kind of morally-diseased wit which is
based on the assumption that everybody is tired
and dirty of soul. When the author gets away
from this one assumption his wit is not above the
average ; when he is on his favourite topic he is
brilliant. Still there is nothing visibly immoral
about his dialogue; it is merely filled with the
flavour of satiety and disgust, and old cigar-
smoke, and pervaded with very, very old young
men, who look boredly at the world through one
weary eye-glass in a club. And seeing that all his
characters, barring the pair above-mentioned, have
got this disease so badly, the assumption is that
these two will also get it when they grow older.
This considerably spoils the interest.
* * •
Oscar Wilde’s dialogue being all built on
the one dismal story that all men and women are
hopelessly immoral, his plot naturally follows the
same lines. The one good woman in the play
elopes at two o’clock a.m.—all the other women
seem to have eloped, more or less, before the
story opened—but is followed and saved from
destruction by an abandoned female of twenty
years’ experience. This incident shows the neces-
sity for always keeping an abandoned female on
the premises—no woman who hadn’t often eloped
herself would know exactly the right thing to do
at such a crisis, or would know how to do it in
the small hours of the morning. Also, the awful
facility with which the only good woman of the
crowd goes wrong at the shortest notice is possibly
intended to show that every woman ought to go
wrong when she is very young, so that she will
know how not to do it afterwards. It further sug-
gests, in a vague, irrelevant fashion, that it must
be a depressing and unwholesome thing to be the
author’s wife—unless the faint effluvium of decay
about his soul is only a laborious pretence and not
a reality.
• • •
There are only three characters of any
real importance in the play, and of these Tither-
adge, as Lord Windermere, has a commonplace
part, and is chiefly necessary that he may draw
cheques for the abandoned female. The aban-
doned female, by-the-way, gets through a heap
of money. Lady Windermere is the best piece
of work Miss Grace Noble has yet done in
Sydney. Her representation of the pretty,
pathetic little wife whose ideal has fallen on her
head, is almost perfect, and when she rises in
insurrection against the abandoned female she
exhibits a tragic intensity of which no one has
hitherto suspected her. Mrs. Brough, as the
female aforesaid, is excellent all through, barring
the fact that her evening-dress is of a dreadfully
glaring character which doesn’t agree with her
alleged desire to get back to respectability; and
Cecil Ward is a nice, beautiful, refreshing idiot,
who is gladdening to the soul. The other characters
—with the exception of Mr. Renouf, a mild
production with no especial features—are on hand
solely that they may get clever epigrams off their
chests, and they fill their purpose satisfactorily.

The “ King of Crime ” still keeps a paying
connection at Her Majesty’s, and other shows are
much as reported in last issue. Owing to Her
Gracious having arranged to have a birthday this
week a small theatrical boom will probably even-
tuate, but at time of writing no aggravated
symptoms have supervened.

Bland Holt’s recent importations from
Drury Lane are put into the shade by “ A Life of
Pleasure.” This is a strong, compact story, as
melodramas go, whilst its spectacular merits are
striking even on the limited stage of Melbourne
Princess’. The slaughter of a humorous Burmese
army by British heroes is not impressive, but the
military incidents appertaining to that inglorious
massacre have a natural air which doesn’t belong
to the average stage-soldier in mock combat and a
misfit uniform. A notion of active service is ex-
pressed upon an Australian stage for the first
time ; also the piece is well played. Sass, for the
nonce, is the vile seducer who causes Miss Watson
to clothe herself in crimson and prepare for a
desperate plunge into impropriety. Fortun-
ately she changes her mind and takes poison
by mistake, after which she recovers her
health and probably turns religious. The dis-
reputable Sass suicides on his wedding - night
to the joy of Miss Harrie Ireland, who dis-
covers her husband’s true character before the
honeymoon has begun. Sass, however, does not
relinquish his honeymoon without a struggle, and
invades the dressing-room of his bride at mid-
night ; but the lady screams for timely aid in a
manner not at all in accordance with the gospel of
Judge Madden. Hence arises the delicate
question as to whether Madden would sympathise
with the suicide of Sass under these circumstances.
The chief honours fall to the artists named, but
others are equally satisfactory. “A Life of
Pleasure ” is fated to enjoy distinguished patron-
age, and Premier Patterson will move a national
vote of thanks to the brigade of Indian hawkers
who assist Bland Holt to exterminate the dacoits.
“ Friends,” at the Bijou, delighted a poor
attendance on Saturday. Eulogy may be boiled
down to the simple statement that “Friends,” by
Garner’s Co., surpasses the Brough-Boucicault
performance of “ Peril.” This is high praise, and
if so excellent an entertainment is to waste its
sweetness upon empty benches the management
had better abandon high-class comedy forthwith.
Harwood and Annie Taylor are specially happy in
their parts, but it comes as a surprise to find
Edith Blande and Bentley playing out of their
usual lines with so much brightness and ease. The
comedy is prettily staged and deserves to be hand-
somely acknowledged by a degenerate public.

The experiment of Fitzgeralds’ circus, at
Melbourne Alexandra, promises well. On Satur-
day the big house was full, and pony Commodore
was observed to wink his tail as though he
reckoned that his proprietors had struck another
rich patch. Plainly, more things can be done
with a ring on the stage than are dreamed of in
ordinary circus-tent philosophy. The ring has
been adroitly environed with bits of woodland
glade, and the beasts of prey form a choice zoo-
logical background. Also, the limelight man
contributes largely to the general success by pro-
ducing blue lions with yellow tails, and other
Jim-Jam effects. This affords but little pleasure
to the animals, and the lion who finds himself
turning green is apt to smile bitterly with the top
half of his countenance while a gigantic frown
corrugates the bottom half from N.E. to S.W.,
and makes everybody hope the management will
see its way to advertise four rounds between the
lion and the limelight man as a grand climax to
the show.

The Sapio-Urso concerts at Melb. Town
Hall have met thus far with far less financial suc-
cess than they deserve, but jpiite as much of it as
could be expected, considering that the business-
manager is a Frenchman who knows naught about
the local “ropes.” Madame Camilla IJrso is a
rare violinist, a great artist, and when she pro-
duces real music her hearers are held enthralled.
Unhappily, it seems necessary for all gifted per-
formers on the violin to prove their technical skill
to other violinists by a series of marvellous scrapes,
in which there is no real meaning or charm for the
common ear and heart of humanity. This com-
plaint holds good against every notable lady-
fiddler. There are times when tjiey torture the
catgut to give forth horrible noises to the glory of
the purely mechanical side of their art. No such
noises can be ascribed to Madame De Vere Sapio,
the soprano singer of this very select combination.
One may say of Madame Sapio that she accomp-
lishes almost as much at the finest vocalists, only
she doesn’t do it so enchantingly. Her voice is
strong and flexible, and highly-trained, but there
seems to be a want of the smoothness which dis-
tinguishes the Pattis of this world. Madame has
a bigger voice than Outtioa’s, but it is, perhaps,
not quite as even, or as pure, or as something to
the same effect. Nevertheless, she is a delightful
singer, and when she warbles to Urso’s accompani-
ment the result is akin to Paradise on a fine day.
A well-rehearsed orchestra of 45 fills in the rest of
the concert, and some pretty little compositions by
Signor Sapio obtain the usual encore.

The jockey who carefully tumbles into the
water-jump, in “The Prodigal Daughter,” gets
paid a few shillings extra per week. On the first
night, at Melb. Princess, the boy nervously fell
off his horse before he reached the little tank, soi
fearing that he might have to forfeit his “bit of
bunce,” he crawled under the hurdle and gave
himself a soaking in the mimic brook. Talking of
this—when Dr. Carver was playing at the Alex-
andra they had to get a super for the job of
jumping from a considerable height into the big
tank. A _ likely-looking young applicant was
selected without any mention of terms. When
Dampier suggested “£2 a week” the man
couldn’t articulate a word for several seconds.
Joy had made him dumb. Then he turned as pale
as a sheet and gurgled, “God bless you! sir.”
He would gladly have dropped twice the distance
for half the money.

Four parsons, of Warrnambool (Yic.),
waited upon the local mayor recently to protest
against the desecration of the Town Hall by a
Sunday sacred-concert company. One of the
reverend quartette objected to the concert because
it was “essentially a commercial undertaking,”
and as such was unfit to take place on the pro-
perty of the burgesses. The other three com-
plainants stated that their spirits were chiefly
bruised by the idea of a charge being made for
admission. Then the mayor reminded them that
clergymen had used the same building for Sunday
services, with a view to taking up a collection,
and to settle the difficulty he would request the
concert company to run their commercial enter-
prise on church lines. As the parsons had now
nothing left to complain about they sorrowfully
withdrew, praying inwardly that Christians would
rush the seating accommodation, and reject the
offertory plate with scorn.

Jenny Hill, the goddess of the London music-halls
W d ®r2 ne A f^ pe ? ra ?? e recen J t . 1 J r on the stage at Johannes-
burg (b. Africa), It was a dismal occasion. The goddess
has suddenly and unaccountably crumbled away. A few
months ago she was young and giddy and gushful; then
like Clark Russel s ‘ Frozen Pirate,” she seems to have
fallen oyer something and become 150 years old almost on
the instant. She had no middle age to let her down
gently; she simply woke to find herself a haggard old
child of no particular date, but with a general aspect of
having been left behind by the Romans. The Johannes,
burg audience found her a pallid, bony, despondent
wreck. She couldn t sing-, or dance, or even stand, but
she sat in a big chair, and whispered a feeble, ramblino-
oration about things in general, while the cockney part of
the crowd cheered and wept by turns. Then the wreck
was helped away, leaving behind a faint flavour of pathos
and a vague idea that Mrs. Skewton had arisen from the
grave. It is a solemn thing to grow old under any circum-
stances, but to grow old suddenly in tights must be a
ghastly event.

a truculent small boy kicks an abnormally large British
sailor until he howls for mercy.

Critic Archer on “The Bauble Shop”;—"The whole

myself: ‘Nol no! things do not happen like this ! These
are not men and women, but sentimental situation-
makers 1 Theatrical 1 false, false, false 1 and not
very cleverly false either.'” Which is a glorious
example of the awful oocksureness of an inflated critic.
“ Things do not happen like this,” says Archer’s “ inward
voice.” A very moderate study of the papers ought to
convince Archer that in real life things happen anyway or
every way, and that the utter unaccountableness of every-
body makes it absolutely impossible for any one to say
how things ought to happen.

846 Macquarie-street North, Sydney,
May 22, 1894.
My Dbab Moobabinda—
If it hadn’t been for the peacock gowning of
the Second Mrs. Tanqueray, “ Lady Winder-
mere’s Fan” would certainly have led the dress-
ing of the present B. and B. season at Sydney
Lyceum, and a very good thing, too, for the
“Fan” doesn’t absorb your attention so com-
pletely that you don’t notice what the women
have on. Some of the “ new ” dramatists take as
much dressing as a French salad. It seems to me
that a modish couturiere is just as solemnly im-
portant a factor in the society play-up-to-date as
the stage carpenter is in melodrama.
Quite the most attractive confection (though
strictly on the safe side of conventional effect;
there are few pioneers in the paths of daring
colour-contrasts) was an albescent robe worn by
Lady Windermere (Grace Noble) in the second
and third acts—a dress of white satin spangled
with silver jaunty paniers and full train
of white satin with a quilted lining. The bodice
was girdled about with silver, and The Fan of
soft white ostrich completed the picture. By the
way, a puff of Miss Noble’s hair came down in the
matrimonial skirmish of the first act, and she
stopped to put it up, though the scene would have
gained much in realism had the heroine played it
out with her wool in her teeth. Not many women
would marshal their hairpins in the exigencies of
the first connubial quarrel, it seems to me.
And, talking of Lady W., why didn’t Miss
Noble wear a wedding-ring ? In the melodrama,
you know, the heavy father in search of his erring
che-yild always explores her left hand to slow
music when he finds her in St. John’s Wood, but
in the “Fan” we have a high-toned heroine guilt-
less of the badge. .
In the middle acts, Mrs. Brough, in blue-corded
silk cut like a pinafore and trimmed with silver
and a court train edged with blue fur, the whole
toilet aggravated by a thing like a shaving-brush
in her coiffure —well, she didn’t please me a bit.
Although there are said to be no old women in
London society, still Mrs. Erlynn was altogether
too fresh for a lady who was “29 with pink shades
—3O without ”on her own admission. A coarser
and more visible fresco and a wig stiff with gold
wash would have been nearer the author but,
then, Mrs. Brough is as wedded to her own hair
as Sarah Bernhardt, though the “Divine” does
occasionally ring the changes among her dye-
bottles and lias been almost every colour but pie-
bald. In the last act, Mrs. Brough’s pale grey-
green rep silk with jaunty jacket of emerald green
velvet and lashings of steel passementerie, small
bonnet en suite, was as effective as Miss Noble s
fluttering white muslin was the other adjective.
There is altogether too much fleeciness about
Lady Windermere. An ' actress-, who is white
three acts running deserves to be turned to a pillar
of salt. "
Titheradge, as Lord Windermere, in a curry-
coloured and curly wig, reminded me of how a
certain Sydney dancing-master would look if he
powdered his hair with ginger. And, talking
about the he-actors, is it the latest London snip
for men to put on their white gloves after they
have shaken hands with their hostess? At the
ball almost every man who came in dragged his
•gloves on in the middle of the reception-room, and
I would like to know whether it’s the caper in
“town” or merely a stage version of the glove
question adopted to.give the actor-man something
to do with his paws ?
The pr<smi6re of the “Fan ” acquired a more or
less society interest from the presence of an
unbroken draft of damsels sent on as ‘ guests, to
judge of their promise by B. and 8., who seek an
ingenue of their own growing and are becoming
convinced that it isn’t necessary to import long-
legged English talent at a high figure just to wear
simple frocks and look impossibly innocent in the
unearthly style of ing&iuedom. Miss Dudlay
(she travelled hitherwards as Miss Ward) is the
latest juvenile forwarded to the care of B. and 8.,
and a damsel more like a baa-lamb on stilts it
would be difficult to imagine. Even in a ball-
gown inches too short in the front she didn t look
ingenuous—only absurd ; and it seems lucky that
Brenda Gibson hadn’t sailed for Ome, as she
threatened, and is still handy as a juvenile if the
worst comes to the worst. Imagination reels at
the thought of Miss Dudlay as the short-skirted
tomboy in “Niobe”; still, for all the world
knows, she may be a Sara Bernhardt.
Among the lady-guests aforesaid, on trial before
preparation, in a manner of speaking, the pretty
daughter of a well-known Sydney doctor pervaded
the ball-room scene in a fluffy pink frock, and
with a graceful ease born of much society experi-
ence. She looked the most promising of the
muster, to my eye, though none of the B. and B.
"colts” shaped extra badly as the guests of Lady
Windermere.
People may argue that the “ Fan” is improbable
on the ground that a man doesn’t want to marry
his grandmother, and that even a jealous wife
wouldn’t get on edge over a woman literally old
enough to be her mother. But experience teaches
us that in life few things are impossible. It
happened, not an age ago, in one of the wretched
kawlinies, that a man introduced a he-friend to
his blushing bride-elect, after which the friend
faded away for a year or so, and when he turned
up again he found the lover a Benedict in decent
sequence.
But the wife puzzled him. Her features,
colouring and hair resembled those of the fiancee,
but making full allowance for the expansiveness
of matrimony and the carking cares of being one
flesh, there isn’t enough “ stingo ” in two years of
it to transform a willowy maiden into a well-
seasoned-looking woman, rather worn round the
edges, and he, puzzled, sought an explanation.
Like all explanations it was the simplest thing in
the world. The girl had turned Tarter after
marriage, and Benedict had cut adrift from her
and married her ma.
A feature of “ Lady Windermere’s Fan ” was
that, in one scene, nearly all the principals carried
swell posies. Now, I wonder is this the fore-
runner of a more open and candid policy in regard
to floral “ managerial ?” Will they come on
frankly from behind in future, and be no more
guilelessly hauled over the floats?
I have received a musical composition called
“ United Australia,” descriptive waltz by A.
Hermes—with music for oboes, horns and other
wild instruments, and words here and there to
keep the enthusiasm up to concert-pitch. There
is much noise and Chinese opera about the
patriotic fantasia, but it has very little merit. It
is a port of battle-of-Prague-and-water, with the
cries of the wounded boiled down to the shrieks
of one gouty invalid.
From a feminine aspect the new dance (it comes
ball-marked from ’Ome) is really taking. There
are airy flights in it and seductively waving arms,
which, however, make one apprehensive that if
smart society takes to practising it outside cafes
by gas-light our up-to-date belles will resemble the
weird vision Tam O’Shanter saw.
Trinity Church, Kelso, the oldest ecclesiastical
building over the Blue Mountains, and built at
Kelso instead of Bathurst at a time when the
“ free and bond ” were divided by the Macquarie
River, the “free” occupying the Kelso, and the
“ bond ” the Bathurst side of the stream—was the
scene of an interesting wedding last week, when
Lieutenant Abdy, R.N., took unto himself Edith
Mary, third daughter of George Lee, M.L.C.
This makes the third generation married in the old
church, the bride’s father and mother, and grand-
father and grandmother having been wedded in
the same unaltered building. Many interesting
reminiscences hang round the spot, and many
pioneers of the plains rest in its old-fashioned
cemetery. In the Lee vaults rests “Ted” Lee,
Crown-prosecutor, sportsman, and generally good
fellow, who died somewhat young, after a merry
innings.
There was not an embarrassment of fine feathers
at the Factory Girls’ ball. Lady Duff, in black
silk and jet draped dowager-wise, with cream-lace,
was half hidden by a committee-bouquet. Mrs.
Edward Hutton in opaline shades of pale-green
and heliotrope, etherealised with cobwebby old
lace and a handsome display of diamonds, must be
regarded as the top-weight of fashion on this occa-
sion among the plain dressers.
Among the poudrd people, Mrs. Prendergast, in
ivory-satin with pale-pink roses, diamonds and
suggestion of grey velvet on the bodice, presented
the most refined ensemble, but ah the powdered
brigade had not been so light on the cosmetics by
a long, long way. How should we blame the im-
pressionists of the ballet when belledom en mas-
querade, which ought to know better artistically,
gets its face up as if the laws of beauty were two
lovely black eyes and sanguineous apoplexy?
Owing to there being so many fancy sets, every
man who had a brass button or a tinsel collar-
band among his assets came out in uniform—
down to the spurs in the case of the military
officers, some of whom were wedged so firmly into
their garments that they looked as if they had been
hard-boiled in their wearing apparel. I really
think, do you know, that the pert bob-tailed shell-
jacket ought not to be worn without reservations.
When a son of Mars shows a tendency to outpace
the weighing-machines it appears to me to be
about time that warrior left off figuring in a red
Eton jacket. Under such circumstances the
temptation to stick pins into the military isnt
wholly monopolised by the calves of the Highland
regiments. “ Uncle,” in a red-shell jacket (it
suits his style of physique), headed the warriors,
who were scattered over the ballroom with the
sunsetty effect of a pint of prawns. For orna-
mental purposes, one plain rank-and-file soldier
will fill the eye more than half-a-dozen admirals.
Apropos of hops, owing to a printer’s error, it
appeared last week that the Fresh Air League
ball is to be on 26th prox., whereas the ball in aid
of that most deserving charity, the Tempo refuge,
dates its tickets (which are selling like rockets, by
the way) for the 26th. On 21st prox., a grand
public ball, in aid of Sydney University Sports
Union, takes place in Sydney Town Hall, under
distinguished patronage ; and, on the 14th June,
a re-union in aid of the Randwick R.C. Church
Fund holds the fort at Paddington Town Hall,
which, as was the case last season, is much to tha
fore as a fashionable ball-room.
“ Ouida ” depicts the English lord as a wicked
Sybarite who drops diamonds into the champagne
of his lady friends and lives in reprehensible mag-
nificenoe. But then he is, after all, the sort or
duke one reads about—he doesn’t often leave nx»
own country, apparently. Anyhow, a lord on tno
globe-trot doesn’t travel de luxe —he does most ot
it on the moral support of bis title, so to speak.
Only the other day a society girl, who had been
one of a party invited to “ mangle garbage witn
a real live lord (he has left us, by the way),
unfolded her dire disappointment. She had go ll ®
expecting something epicurean and original, but,
alas ! this ineffective lordling dropped no pearls m
their coffee-cups—simply sooled them on to a good
square meal with ordinary trimmings, and looked
quite pleased with himself. .And not only this
recent lordling, but nearly all itinerant aristocrats
cut things pretty fine in the hospitality way in this
tinpot country. If “ Ouida ” wants to study the
reverse of her prodigal peers, Australia s her
workshop, it seems to me.
Madame Belle Cole, the third deep-0 warbler
who has tested the weight-carrying capacities of
Australian concert platforms in the last two years,
is a queen-like —Queen Viotoria-like artist with
plenty of lung-space for her well-oiled vocal organ,
and not a bad notion of how to dress herself
either. To the exceedingly plump, few garments
are possible, and Belle Cole (as I saw her) in white
brocade slashed with dark-green velvet on the
skirt and a good show of diamonds, looked as
undulating as one could reasonably expect. A
contralto voice appears to be as antagonistic to
willowy outlines as a seat in the Upper House.
By the way, the second Cole concert in Sydney
Town Hall was advertised as a V.R. night.
Governor and Lady Duff had _ promised to be
present, but a cluster of cane furniture on a square,
like a Moslem’s prayer-party high and dry in the
middle of the floor space, was all that told of the
expected presence of vice-royalty. However, the
charming major-generaless, in a warlike scarlet
opera-cloak, lent tone to the reserved seats and
made an excellent substitute.
To Madame’s rich and friendly voice I give my
almost complete approval. I don’t say I would
rush through the rain without any goloshes to hear
her sing the “Lost Chord,” which she warbles
with her head on one side and far too much vocal
colour, but in any music where a luxuriance of
feeling almost verging on the melodramatic is
necessary, Madame Belle Cole is ahead of the
field. And you like her for the way she effaces
herself. Most much-puffed artists look so hideously
conscious of the beautiful language used about
them in the papers that you quite forget what
they’re singing about. However, despite all
these attractions, Sydney hadn’t commenced to
tear its gardens up by the roots and hurl them at
the feet of Madame or any of her co. “at time of
going to press.” I never saw so flowerless an
entertainment as the second concert.
Of the Cole company Emily Spada has a fruity
soprano very artistically handled, but without
much dignity of tone. I heard Miss S. sing
“Angels Ever Bright and Fair” as if she was
winking at an archangel, though towards the end
she remembered to be more devout. Mr. New-
bury, the robust tenor, looks like Deslouis on the
platform and sings with baritone force and fervour
but a clogged articulation as if he rolled the
words under his tongue ; and basso Magrath ha.s a
rich but jarring voice which impresses you with
the notion that it will loosen his front teeth some
day_it certainly shakes his music-sheet. With a
more tranquil production and a less fervent belief
in himself Mr. Magrath would shine in any com-
pany. The remaining member of the co. is the
blonde Mdlle, Murkens whose baby-dimpled elbow
best excuses her appearance as a professional
violiniste.
The amusing feature of the Factory Girl’s Club
ball, at Sydney Town Hall the other evening, was
the frantic way in which people who had the
foggiest connection with the management scorned
plain evening dress, and grabbed a May-pole, or
tied a 0.M.G.-looking ribbon round their torsos,
or merely agitated the flour-dredge over their
devoted heads—anything to show that they were
the kernel of the show, so to speak. One com-
mittee youth had a wisp of green and yellow paper
tied round his arm to distinguish him from the
ordinary simple-minded visitor, the green and
yellow tissue aforesaid coming off one of the
“Lampshade” fancy dresses—French fowl-like
confections of green and yellow (as if woman’s
next idea was to reconcile Home Rule with the
L.0.L.), made up of crinkled paper frills in the
two colours, and meant to be rendered dazzling
by a head-dress of electric points. But the lamps
only worked successfully in one instance, tho’
coatless electricians lurked in the corridors and
tried to renew exhausted batteries, with the effect
of Howard Vernon in the “ Mountebanks ” wind-
ing Ophelia up.
By such means as these the society people who
foster-mothered the G.F. ball made themselves
into a pleasing masquerade for the ordinary, open-
mouthed onlooker, and caused the evening to pass
like a pantomime to the galleryites, I rather
thought the whole ball played to the gallery. The
first sign of it was the Swedish danoe performed
by the full strength of the crime de la crime, while
the others looked on. As I hear, by the way, that
this aforementioned dance—a good deal like Sir
Roger de Ooverley, with aggravations—is going to
be the barn dance of ’94, I may as well remark,
for the benefit of the dancing-man, that it cannot
be got through in glove-fit inexpressibles without
hair-raising apprehensions on the part of the
wearer. Kneeling on one knee is not generally
allowed for in this practical age by a man’s tailor,
and the ball-room he-butterfly who isn’t quite
sure whether the moth has been through his ward-
robe or not had better pause before he shakos a
loose leg in the Swedish danoe.
Yours apprehensively,
SAPPHO SMITH.
Melbourne Confidences.
“Melbourne, May 22, 1894.
Latest Mildura gossip is, that young Cltaffey
i(son of the founder of the settlement) is engaged
to one of Railway Speight’s daughters, who has
been up there visiting her sister, the wife of Lord
Ranfurley’s manager.
The Sapio and Urso concerts are not well
attended so far, except in the plebeian parts of the
house. Madame De Vere Sapio is, in appearance,
pale and rather colourless, and, when dressed in
white satin with gloves and shoes en train and her
hands clasped in front, she looks as demure as a
girl going to her first communion. This negative
exterior doesn’t prepare one for her splendid sing-
ing, which, in brilliancy of execution, at all events,
surpasses anything hitherto heard in Melb. since
di Murska. Mdrae. Urso is short and very stout,
and doesn’t look in the least graceful playing her
violin. However, hers is another case wberu
appearance counts for nothing. Chopin’s “ three
minutes valse,” tripping from under her bow, is a
measure so ethereally dainty and fairylike as to
sound almost out of place in a sordid and common-
place world.
Mons. the manager of the concerts, is a
handsome man, with clear-cut features and wav-
ing silvery hair. He is said to be something of a
martinet, and keeps everybody connected with
the entertainments well up to the mark. The
audiences also come in for a share of his attention.
If he spies a lady in the “ dress seats ” wearing
even the most unobtrusive of hats, he despatches
an attendant with a polite message which soon
produces the desired result. M. Lucre is the sort
of person sent by Providence to uphold the
majesty of showman business, and on vice-regal
nights he must, I’m sure, wear a halo and look
like one inspired.
At a recent Cathedral crush the clergy’s seats
were rushed by women, who refused to resign
them to the rightful owners pro. tem. Vergers
were repulsed with parasols and scorn, and sweet-
voiced precentors found their blandishments fall
on deaf ears. Even when a. massive parson
approached with an exoommunicative frown, one
dauntless female held her ground and remained,
calm and defiant, among the surplices until the
end of the service.
Again this week a deputation of poor, timid
souls interviewed the Minister of Lands and in-
formed him, among other things, that upon a
specified occasion he “ got drunk and said
naughty words.”
A man, visiting Mr. Mclntyre with this pleas-
ing intelligence, would probably be like Long-
fellow’s Benedict, “who knew by the hob-nailed
shoes it was Basil,” but women, entrenched behind
the traditional sancity of their skirts, proceed to
slang male opponents with impunity. One of the
deputationists, after treading on the Minister, dis-
played extreme solicitude for her own personal
dignity. She declined to be addressed as “ Mrs.,”
on the ground that “Madame” was her correct
title. Mr. Mac. might have replied aptly with an
accent on the “ Mad.”
Professor Marshall Hall, they say, looks for-
ward to founding a Conservatoire in Melbourne.
His scheme will inevitably raise the ire of local
musicians, most of whom have little sympathy
with the professor. One of M. H.’s pet theories
is that, if necessary, an artist should do, suffer, or
sacrifice anything for his art. If bread-and-cheese
sons of harmony raise the domestic household
question the answer is, “ A man must leave wife,
children, father, mother, etc., and cleave unto his
art,” i.e,, don’t absolutely let them starve but regard
them as minor considerations in the fattening of
art.
However, the doctrinaire himself has apparently
solved the problem of both art and mammon, as,
besides being a genius, he is the recipient of a
comfortable salary, and can be soulful on the
solid foundation of .£lOOO a year. And local
nymphs of the urn do say that if Marshall Hall’s
coffee is not sufficiently strong, he reveals an
unexpectedly mundane side of his character. His
allegro movements are also full of subtle meaning
when the milk gets scorched.
Lalla Miranda, who left for London, the other
day, spent her last evening in Melb. at the Bijou,
in company with Mr. and Mrs. Turner, of exhibi-
tion concert fame. The songstress wasn’t looking
her usual bright self, partly owing to a sombre
black gown, and partly, perhaps, to a preliminary
twinge of home-sickness. The Ormuz passengers
should have a pretty cheerful time with lilting
Lalla and dramatic Miss. Bensusan, of Sydney,
both aboard.
Miss Mattie Thompson, second daughter of the
Leviathan bookmaker, and well-known as a taker
of prize after prize at Melb. rink carnivals during
the skating boom, was married on 10th Feb. last
to Mr. H. E. Topping (a son of the well-known
English ringman).
VAN M.
An old Maitland identity has just passed
over, aged 92 years—Eliza, relict of the late
Henry Incledon Pilcher. She has left behind her
some brainy sons, amongst them being C. E.
Pilcher, Q. 0., M.L.0., the pallid and cold-blooded
gentleman who, when he really puts his heart into
a jury case, civil or criminal, has not and never
has had, any superior as an advocate at the Aus-
tralian bar.
The saddest thing which has happened to
The Bulletin for 13 years past arrived last
Monday, when a bard from Neutral Bay sent in
the following letter; —
I beg to enclose for publication in your next issue, a
few lines written for the approaching anniversary of Her
Majesty’s birthday. I know that the sentiment generally
expressed in your paper is not of as loyal a nature as I
should wish to see, but I feel that, at heart, you must be
as loyal as myself, for instance, and that, like the Pistes
of Penzance, with all your faults you must still love Her
Most Gracious Majesty. I trust that the accompanying
few lines may serve to bring forth that loyalty which I
feel sure is only latent in your heart.
The following unspeakable slush is “the few
lines ” in question :
Hark, the merry joy-bells’ pealing
Richly freights the eager air !
Born aloft, the loyal feeling
Trembles o’er the landscape fair.
Far and wide each heart is throbbing
With the pray’rful, happy lay.
Which we, blissful e’en to sobbing.
Sing this twenty-fourth of May.
“ Hail Regina, Dei gratia I”
Great Australia humbly saith,
"Ever proudly filta tua,
Queen, Defender of the Faith!
" May thy subjects still deserve thee—
Thee so marked with Sorrow’s hand.
And thy loving,, tender name be
Ever great thro’out the land.
And this is The Bulletin’s reward for 13 years
of consistent Republicanism J

Victoria has had 16 Prime Ministers, < f

Mr. Lamonby, well-known as a Melbourne
sporting pressman, and now connected with Lon-
don Field, contests a Parliamentary seat against
Wilfred Lawson, the teetotal punster.
The enemies of Mundella (their name is

The Bulletin hopes that Robb. Reid, the
missionary from Melbourne, will be knigbted as
soon as possible. It would be a pity to have any
delay in the case of this blatant and deserving
drummer.
Haddon Chambers, who fancies himself as
a boxer, lately “took on” a man much heavier

Of the Dora Dora blacks, “Jacky’’goes

N.S.W. Government Astronomer. He sleeps

Among those who asked fur mercy for ex-
banker Abigail was Frank Wright, M.L. A. Every

ineffectual criminal prosecution some years ago !
Alleged in Adelaide that Wood, defaulting
S.A. public trustee, could recently have been

reasons which everyone in Adelaide knows.
Wood’s arrest would cause a flutter in many dove-
cotes.
A former Blackheafch (N.S.W.) clergyman

Dear Bulletin, —Look at “Diplomacy”
written for you in January, ’93, and then look at
any chapter of “The Yellow Aster.” Then
answer, who wrote “ Diplomacy ? ” “ lota ? ”
If not, the hand that wrote the novel penned the
sketch. —P.W.
Robert Louis Stevenson’s mother was in
Melbourne last week. She says that since R. L.
wrote “ A Footnote to History ” he has been
severely cut by all the German officials at Samoa,
and the German naval officers are not allowed to
call on him as they formerly did.
Robert Louis Stevenson is second cousin
to the sanctified James Balfour, of Melbourne,
The father of that humourless elder was own
brother to Stevenson’s maternal grandfather, so
the novelist’s mysticism would seem to be a poetic
development of old Kirk bigotry.
Sladen says that when he went to America
he was introduced everywhere as the Australian
Laureate. At first he objected faintly, but a
Boston editor told him that “everybody in
Boston has a label; that’s your label; and you’d
best let it be.” So Sladen let it be. So like
Sladen!
Since his elevation to the Yic. Premier-
ship J. B. Patterson has cultivated an extra
ordinary newness. In the matter of tailoring,
collars, cuffs, boots, gloves and shave, he is the
newest man in Melbourne, and half his power is
in the dazzling lustre of his brand-new silk hat.
Politically, he is even shabbier than ever.
In the deputation of Pentridge and Mel-
bourne gaol-warders to the Chief Secretary, which
was formed for the purpose of protesting against
the proposed reductions in their salaries, the five
members thereof were all Irishmen—Ryan, Don-
aghue, Murphy, Fitzgerald, and Stone. What a
time the Scotch prisoners must have, to be sure !
Mary Gaunt, whose Australian story has
been so favourably reviewed by the Melb. daily to
which she contributes, is the daughter of Judge
Gaunt and inherits a large share of the family
beauty. Her brother is a lieutenant on the
Sydney naval station, and her fiance is Dr. Miller,
of Warrnambool, one of the handsomest and most
rollicking of Victorian medicos.
The first man to persistently use “our
Beautiful Harbour ” as a bold advertisement was
Tommy Stubbs, the old-time Sydney auctioneer.
He used the words to some point in his evidence
before the “ Monetary Confusion ” Select Com-
mittee of 1843. Tommy was as guileless as the
rostrum knights usually are, but the whole of the
Harbour water won’t wash off his memory the sin
of inventing the phrase.
The lady mayor of Onehunga is not getting
a fair chance. A man mayor, being continually
assailed by temptations to wrangle and lose his
head, would undoubtedly cut a much meaner
figure than Mrs. Yates has made of herself
hitherto. The ordinary mayor is a raving maniac
when baited by his brethren in private. This
seems to be a case of the public rolling up to assist
at a pre-arranged rumpus.
“ Mr. Geoffrey Eagar, once a prominent
figure in N.S.W. politics,” says Sydney D.T.,
proposes to re-enter public life and will stand as a
candidate for the Glebe as a Freetrader,” &c.
Now, the Mr, Eagar who used to figure in N.S.W.
politics has long been dead, and the present
candidate is his son. And, by the way, the
Geoffrey Eagar was an enthusiastic Protectionist,
like his colleague, James Martin.
N.S.W. Minister Suttor takes with him
to Canada at State expense a secretary (Mr. 0.
Lyne) and a messenger. “Messenger” is good,
and, of course, means valet. By the way, a certain
exalted N.S.W. official makes the departmental
messenger help him pull on his shirt. You
couldn’t expect Charley Lyne to pull on the
Minister’s shirt, and Heaven forbid that so illus-
trious a person as Suttor should have to pull on
his own shirt.
When bushranger Moonlight was charged
with murder, before Mr. Love, the fussy
Gundagai (N.S.W.) P.M., he harangued the
Bench for three hours, until at last the pangs of
hunger wore out poor old Love. “If the
Attorney-General, or any other barrister learned
in the law, were to insult me half as much as you
have done I would order him to be turned out of
Court.” “I wish to God,” retorted the’ranger,
“ that you would turn me out then.”
The grand idea of Premier Patterson’s
life is to have the week-day life of erring humanity
regulated by calm Sabbathian principles, so that
Sunday will be practically the same as Saturday,
and not a bit different from Tuesday or Wednesday.
Patterson, it appears, has elevated his own daily
life up to this standard. Existence is one eternal
Sunday with him, and he sees no reason why
banquets should be restricted to six-sevenths of
the week, since he is prepared at all times to gorge
to the glory of God,
Marie Belloc, writer of the article on
Henri Rochefort, in a current Idler, is the
daughter of Madame Belloc (cousin to ex-Premier
Parkes). She is an exceedingly clever and charm-
ing young woman, half French, half English, and
wholly pretty. Petite and plump, she makes a
delicious picture (to the masculine mind, at any-

David Christie Murray, the gay Lothario
of 1894, writing ten years ago, rhapsodises in
“Coals of Fire and Other Stories”
Love works strange metamorphoses. To be in love is a
delicious and an altogether admirable thing. I would be
in love again to-morrow if I could. You should be
welcome to your foolish laugh at my raptures. Ah me ! I
shall never know those raptures any more ; and the follies
you will laugh at in me will he less noble, less tender, less
innocently beautiful than those of young love.
Yea, David, verily thou wast a true prophet.
A number of nasty paragraphs are being
written re the domestic affairs of David Christie
Murray, lately sued in London for maintenance
by his wife, who, poor woman, is naturally wild
because she has been left with .£1 a-week, or less,
“ to work a sewing-machine for from ss. to 12s. a-
week,” while David, and the nice, musical girl he
picked up in Melbourne, occupy diggings for
which he pays .£3 3s. weekly. However, accord-
ing to the newspaper reports, Mrs. Murray ad-
mitted in court that she had been confined in an
asylum for grog and morphia victims. Much may
be forgiven a man whose wife takes either grog or
morphia—provided that he didn’t drive her to it.
Mannikin Sammy Oracknell, the ginger-
bearded jockey, got charged the other day with
“assaulting ” a Melb. pub.-keeper. But then the
victim of Sammy’s muscle was a man not much
bigger than himself, so the matter assumed
ordinary dimensions in a relative sense. The
incident recalls to mind the old story of Sammy,
who had just ridden the winner of an important
h andicap, putting himself beside Bon nor, the
giant, and saying, “ George, you and me, I reckon,
are the two biggest sanguinary men in Australia,”
Another Jacky Dow story. Swaggy asks
work from Dow, who, to “ ascertain his bonaj
fides,” sets him at the homestead door and tells
him to bow. “Who to?” asks swaggy. “Never
mind who to, my man ; all you have to do is to
bow,” was Dow’s reply. And so, all day, in the
heat of the sun, poor swaggy bowed to the distant
horizon. At nightfall he explained to the station
hands that his (adjective) back was broken in
various (adjective) places. When Dow appeared
upon the scene next morning, the light bower
was a speck in the far distance.
Dear Bulletin, —I am tired of the puffery
accorded by you to Meteorologist Wragge. Vanity
is Wragge’s mainspring, and he has no works.
When a man prophesies every day of his life,
some of his predictions must come true ; people
remember the few truths and forget the fictions.
When the big flood of ’93 rose Oft. over Brisbane
bridge, Wragge didn’t predict that, but three days
afterwards he publicly ukased that if it kept fine
the water would continue falling. A few weeks
later he did predict the greatest cycloneon record,
but it hasn’t come yet, although chimney-stacks
were secured, and respectable merchants held back
orders, expecting galvanised-iron to rise (in two
senses). Wragge gets a fat screw, has had two or
three daisy trips at the country’s expense attend-
ing conferences and examining black gins for
scientific purposes, and is altogether an over-
boomed individual.— Disgusted.
Chief Justice Madden has broken
again. This time Sir Oracle, K.C.M.G., deal®
with dipsomania, and puts his little say-so agains C
the opinions of experts, with the bovine confT
denceof an important personage who likes himself
very much, and doesn’t care who knows it. Ob-
serve :
Drunkenness is no more a disease than any of the other
defaults which are the subject of investigation in the
courts. It may just as well be said that adultery is a
disease, for it might also arise from a diseased and un-
disciplined will.
His Honor abolishes the idea of a hereditary
taint in one act, also the possibility of con-
cupiscence being a disease or the effect of a disease.
Evidently there is more in man and woman than
is dreamt of in Madden’s philosophy. He is not
even conscious of his own ailment, which is an
aggravated case of swelled head.
Another Tyson
story—with a differ-
ence. Travelling along
a Queensland track,
on a shaggy pony, the
man of millions over-
took a young teamster,
with whomhecamped
for dinner. The road
was heavy, and the
carrier’s horses fag-
ged. The loading
was for two stations,
the first on the line
being one of Tyson’s,
a circumstance the
carrier lamented.
Had it been the other
way about, lie ex-
plained, he’d borrow
fresh horses before
pushing on, but he
wouldn’t think of
asking that mangy
Tyson for even the
loan of a lucifer.
Thereupon the stran-
ger remarked that
somehow he had never
heard anyone speak
well of Tyson. Had
the carrier? “Well,
yes,” answered the
carrier, “my father
always spoke well of
him. He was a mate
of Tyson’s years ago,
and wouldn’t hear a
word saidagainsthim.
He always said that
there was good stuff
in Jimmy in spite of
what people said to
the contrary.” Before
parting, Tyson ascer-
tained hiscompanion’s
name, and the following day, when the carrier
arrived at the station, there was ready in the yard
a splendid team of horses, which Tyson gave as a
present to the son of his old mate who wouldn’t
hear a word said against him. ft
Dear Bulletin,—ln your article “The
Victorian Bar ” you omit an incident which goes
to show that a member of the blood royal is not
ipso facto an inherent ass. The story is as
follows ; —Some brilliant member of the then most
fashionable Sydney club, at 4 p.m. one day, pro-
posed the boycotting of the leading counsel for
the defence in Regina v. O Farrell (for shooting
to murder the Duke of Edinburgh). At 4 o’clock
next afternoon, to the chagrin of all the dudes,
who should come down the block arm-in-arm but
the Duke and Aspinall, Q.C. !—0.8.M.
The crowd who waited on N.S. W. Minister
of Justice Slattery to ask for the release of bank-
cronk Abigail, ex-N.S.W. Minister of Mines,
afforded a lovely study. Hardly any of them
were really friends of the prisoner—for people
who have got into gaol never have any but obscure
friends. Half the deputation went to the Justice
office only to work a political rig, and had its eye
on the Orange vote and the general election all
the time ; another lot went there because it knew
very well that it ought to be in gaol itself, and so
thought bluff the best policy ; and a third division
appealed for Abigail, not because it cared a curse
for him, but because it was working for the
emancipation of Peter Howe, ex-M.P., or Miller
or some other of the brigade of bank and building
society crooks. Abigail, as an ex-Minister of the
Crown--poor Crown !—is, as it were, the loco-
motive of the whole trap-full of rogues. When he
starts, the train follows.
The Sydney representative of a big Lon-
don publishing house confessed the other day that
his firm made, proportionately, far more money
out of “ Australasian literature” than out of. any
other line. Which reminds us that Louis Becke’s
charming South Sea stories which have appeared
from time to time in The Bulletin, are being
republished in London by Fisher-XJnwin. They
will form one of the Autonym (uniform with the
Pseudonym) series, the first of which will be by
Marion Crawford. The Bulletin predicts for
Mr. Becke’s stories a success unparalleled in South
Sea literature. At any rate, they deserve it.
IS HE TO BE “SIR” ARTHUR?—TO DAY IS THE DAY.
Dear Bulletin, —Have you noticed how
the cheap and natural “zinco” process for illus
trating books, papers, etc., is playing up with the
lord-loving proclivities and religious loyalty of a
devoted people? Since the adoption of this
process by the jingo-ridden English illustrated
weeklies, the “orty” British aristocrat has
dwindled to an insignificant five-feet-four mostly,
and is found to have a wry spine, and two large,
obtuse front teeth, which give him the intellectual
aspect of a boiled rabbit; also, the Prince of
Wales has grown suddenly fatter and balder, and
loyalists are inexpressibly shocked to find that he
has no legs worth mentioning above the knee.
Lately a London illustrated, run for years exclu-
sively for the glorification of the Royal Family,
the nobility, and the military, came out with a
picture of Queen Victoria that resembled a canvas-
covered merry-go-round with a hat on top. I
want to ask shouldn’t the process be put down as
treasonable and seditious, and calculated to under-
mine the throne, burst up the constitution, and
bring the House of Lords into contempt?—S.S.
At the Wesleyan General Conference
Meeting, on May 14, a vote of thanks was passed
to God “ for the abundant blessings bestowed
upon the New Guinea Mission,” and another t«

members at a garden-party.
The Australian’s Recklessness.
The Englishman and the Scotchman, and
especially the latter, have much to say in and out
of season about the recklessness of the Australian,
the ease with which he throws aside work for play,
and his general improvidence. Especially against
the bush Australian do they level the accusation
that he is, with few exceptions, a periodical
drunkard ; that he can never earn a cheque without
itching to spend it; and that improvidence begins
and ends in him. To judge superficially as the old
worlders have done, without any knowledge or
appreciation of Australian conditions,- all the
foregoing charges are true. But treat the subject
intelligently and you find the Australian is jiut
the reverse. All that is wrong with him is dys-
pepsia at the beginning, and later on aggravate d
kidney diseases. The menu of the bush is un-
varying, which is in itself a bad thing, and of
poor quality, which is very much worse. Damper
to the writer, and such damper as he used to make,
is a substance constituted merely of flour, water,
bicarbonate of soda, if you have it, no bicarbonate
of soda if yon haven’t any, a little salt and a large
fire. Six months of such a diet finds the bnshman
surcharged with bile; his stomach coated with the
tannin of the unspeakable tea ; his throat caked
with the soot of sheep-wash tobacco ; then lie gets
his cheque and winds up at the shanty. We have
numberless instances of bush dyspepsia and fever
having been completely cured by a few doses Of
the Oure. It gently stimulates the jaded system,
and reorganises the disorganised functions.
Warner’s Safe Cure is the one bush medicine.

“The wave that washes the Liberal leader

No less than 89 of the present candidates

An Australian Premier observed recently :

That most ardent of Freetraders—the
Sydney housewife —acknowledges that “things
were never so cheap ” as now under Protection.
She finds fault with but one Act of the Protec-
tionist Ministry, their abolition of _ the tea-
duty. A specific tax on any article is against
inferior quality, as it will always bear a larger
proportion to the lower cost of producing the
cheaper rubbish. Thus a 6d. tax on a fid. article
would be 100 per cent., the same tax on a Is.
article would be only 50 per cent. In England,
when the remission of the, malt duty took place,
the market was flooded with cheap foreign barley
previously unsaleable. Sydney is now flooded
with cheap and nasty tea.

into it he will get back five millions in a very few
years.’ In other words, Mr. Carnidge points out
that the Australian, being in a very ba,d way just
now, may be induced to sell, for a million, pro-
perty which he will be glad, a little later on, to
buy back for five millions, thus losing, or being
swindled out of, four millions by the transaction.
Therefore, Mr. Carnidge urges the foreign specu-
lator to come along and defraud his flock before it
is too late. It is a beautiful thing to find the
heavenly shepherd thus shoving the boom along
for the benefit of the foreign shindykit.
Sydney’s own Jawbone Neild, who once
spoke in Parliament for nine solid hours, is being
opposed for Woollahra by Adrian Knox, also a
Freetrader. Mr. Knox is a coming equity lawyer,
and is understood to have made a big gold-punch
at Coolgardie. He drives a spanking dog-cart,
and as respectability still consists somewhat in a
gig ’.Jawbone will find in Mr. Knox a formidable
opponent. Despite Neild’s ghastly puns, it would
be rather a pity to see him out of Parliament,
where he has successfully initiated perhaps more
useful measures than any other individual private
member. Notwithstanding that he is the Head
Centre or something of the L.0.L., whatever that
may be, he is at heart no more a religious bigot
than his chief, Parkes, who, like many another
political humbug, no doubt slaps his thigh and
grins behind the altar of useful old King Billy.
In a Maoriland court, the other day, a
husband and wife were charged with sly-grog-
selling. Their lawyer arranged that the cases
should be tried separately. The man was charged
first, but the lawyer proved so conclusively that
the offence was committed by the wife that he
was acquitted. Then the woman was charged,
before another jury, but the same lawyer rose up
and proved beyond any possible doubt that the
offence was committed by her husband only, and
the jury discharged her also. Yet if any layman
had called that lawyer a liar it would probably
have been actionable.
A few months ago Mr. Moss, British
Resident at Raratonga, and John Webster, of
Opononi, Hokianga, interviewed the Governor of
Maoriland “on island matters.” _ Possibly this
had something to do with Seddon’s idea of taking
over the Government of Samoa from the Three
Powers. Webster, by the way, is an old South
Sea wanderer. He was with Ben Boyd in his
fatal cruise in the Wanderer yacht. An English
paper says :
Mr. Webster’s connection with South Sea affairs goes
back to 1851, when he was on board the yacht Wanderer, 12
guns, with the celebrated Ben Boyd, cruising in the
Pacific, with the intention of founding a South Sea
liepublio. The murder of Boyd on the island of Guadal-
camar put an end to the expedition, but in 55-6 Mr.
Webster had a narrow escape of becoming “ King of the
Cannibal Islands,” when a fresh idea was conceived of
forming some of the islands into a confederation under the
protectorate of the Government of the Sandwich Islands.
Mr Webster was appointed sovereign chief of Eastern San
Ohristoval; Mr. Charles P. Juliet), N.S. Wales, of Marau ;
and Mr. C. G. De Reeves, of Malo. In 1859, King Kam-
mehehay (sic) created Mr. Webster a Knight Commander
of the Order of Arossi, to which only four appointments
were ever made. The Confederation of San Ohristoval
through various causes never became an accomplished
fact, and England and Germany of late years have
divided the Solomon Islands between them.
The “founding a South Sea Islands Republic ” is
good. Boyd simply went to the Solomons on a
blackbirding trip in a piratical vessel. The
Wanderer returned without him, and the captain
reported that Boyd had been killed. As a matte^.
of fact, no one saw him killed. He went on shore
and never came back again, and the captain of
the Wanderer didn’t waste time in looking for his
chawed-np fragments. The yacht was wrecked
off Port Macquarie on her way back to Sydney,
and proved a godsend to the people of that dreary
village. _ >

A private letter received in
Sydney from one of the British
S. Africa Chartered Co.’s pioneers
gives the Matabele slaughter
away badly. Mashonaland, the
territory which the co. were
Royal-chartered to exploit, was
found to be unhealthy, most of
the pioneers were down with
malaria, and the eo.’s shares
were falling fast. In this pre-
dicament Matabeleland was found
to be exceedingly healthy, besides
being supposed to be fabulously
rich in gold. The “ war ” followed
as a consequence, and shares re-
covered. However, hardly any-
thing but worked - out claims,
centuries old, have since been
discovered in the grabbed terri-
tory, and the letter ends with the
prediction that, unless some good
gold-finds are shortly announced,
shares will slump again. Then —
-another “ war”?
Only the initiated (remarks an English
paper) were aware that the “ Dr. Howard,’ who
for the last few years has been one of the residents
of South Kensington, was no other than the
spy Le Caron, whose evidence in the Parnell
Commission trial proved so valuable. _ After
that historic period the Major was in receipt of a
handsome annuity from the Times, which further
insured his life at a very large sum; this, by the
Way, will give the Major’s very attractive
daughter quite a comfortable fortune. He Caron s,
or rather Dr. Howard’s, life at the last was, if
anything, quite as much threatened as at any
period of his adventurous career, so graphically
related in the well-known volume he published
some years since. His house was guarded by a
posse of detectives, for the fate of Carey, there is
no doubt, awaited Le Caron had he relaxed for a
moment his vigilance. x
The second gathering of traders connected
with confectionery, baking, and grocery, an-
nounced in our advertising columns, to be held in
London, England, in September next, will be earned
out on strictly trade lines, and will be similar to
that held every October by the brewing and dis-
tilling trades. Bread and confectionery-making
were last year carried on at this exhibition in a
very large way, and over 1000 loaves a day were
given to the poor of London. The first show was
attended by over 125,000 traders, and the
engineers and other exhibitors who filled the
Royal Agricultural Hall (which is the largest
building in London) were more than satisfied with
the number of orders they received. A number of
American and foreign firms have taken up space
for this year’s exhibition, and those interested in
the trade will find it well repay them to make a
visit.

A fashionable Australian tailor has filed

standing debts. His estate is likely to realise far
more than 20s. in the £. The poor devil daren’t
dun. Some time ago he sent the nephew of a
social bigwig a final notice. The amount, about
JlBO, was paid under pressure, but the “bad pay,”
in revenge, probably," used his influence so that the
tailor lost all his custom among the members of a
club. So, consequently, he deems it better to file
than to ask for his own.

Chinese laundries are rapidly increasing in
Melbourne, and are,to be seen with startling fre-

plaintive appeal from their cheap and leprous
Eopularity one can now see “ The Englishwoman’s

and other melancholy attempts to wean the
affections of the lady of the house from the yellow
curse to her white brothers and sisters. Why are
there no Chinese laundries in Sydney ? And why
do they sell apples by the pound in Melb. instead

The S.M. Herald’s argument in favour ot

burglary was becoming too common an offence at
the time they took to the business. The Herald
should set a man to think this point out.

Chief-Justice Madden is surprised to find
that a considerable proportion of his customers, ab
Melb. Divorce Court, have been married by Rev.
Nat. Kinsman. But it is also a fact that a largo
percentage of the happy couples, who go market-
ing on Saturday nights, were joined in wedlock by
that same ordained furniture-dealer. Every time
Madden meets a jubilant father pushing the
perambulator he can safely take eight to one, or
even shorter odds, that Kinsman gave religious
sanction to the baby’s birth. Likewise, when
Justice Madden observes a pair of dark forms
hugging one another in the gloaming, he may
wager his 30s. bell-topper to a 12 guinea dress-suit
that the amorous objects will presently swear
away their freedom in old Nathaniel’s back
parlour. After which he may estimate their
chance of flying to Madden for relief from bond-
age. Ere committing himself to further remarks
on the psychological aspect of Kinsman marriages
the learned Judge had better know for certain the
number of Melbourne people who get spliced by
anybody else. Meanwhile, he will oblige The

Mr. Alf. Smart, a Melbourne architect, is
off to London with a patented process for burning
pictures upon wood panels. The. novelty of
Smart’s invention lies in the fact that the hot
point of his hollow drawing-pencil (made of
platinum) doesn’t touch the wood. Delicate
cauterisation is effected by hot air; the artist
draws his decorative pattern, or picture, with
heated atmosphere, modulating his tints by the
distance between the pencil and the wood. One
of the best samples of the inventor’s own skill is a
character-portrait of George Lauri, who has a
share in the little syndicate formed for working
the patent. This new hot-point process admits of
much finer artistic work than the old “ poker ”
method, which it is bound to supersede. Further-
more, it should enlarge the sphere of burnt-wood
panelling, and carry culchaw into many a numble
’ome.

The father of the
damsel who eloped, a while
back, with the married
organist of a fashionable
suburban Melbourne
church, has died of some-
thing very like a broken
heart. Fond parents should
never allow their daughters
to join the choir. If
trouble doesn’t come
through the curate, it is
nearly certain to arrive
per medium of the saint
who plays the accompani-
ments, or the boss Bible-
class Jeacher. The visiting
revivalist is likewise a man
to be much feared when
all the other perils fail.

One of the cable liar’s
grandest achievements up
t'o v date is the earthquake
in Venezuela, by which
exactly 10,000 lives were
lost. It is now hinted
that the, earthquake never
took place. Some pre-
monitory rumblings were
announced ; the cableman
took the quake for granted,
and wrc te down 10,000
deaths as a matter of
course. He has a mania
for the good round figure
aforesaid. When the next
European war comes on
the tapis the first loss of
the defeated side will in-
variably be estimated at
10,000,. but later telegrams
Will disclose that the other
si.de was defeated with a
(ike result. The fate of
the battle is subject to
alteration, but the heaps
of slain tot up to 10,000 in
any case.
Dear Bulletin, —I am one of four un-

us to get husbands. The other day the City
Employment Committee of Pittsburg, U.S.,
issued notice that they would employ only
married men. Next day the marriage-license
clerk was at work from 9 a.m. till dark. Every
unmarried Italian, Pole and Hungarian in Pitts-
burg hunted up a wife. Now, why can’t this be
done in Australia? If the Government would
only make a law that no single man would be kept
in the service, what thousands of hippy-homes
there would soon be ! —Yours, Amelia McGaunt.

The Pitcairn islanders are having bad
times nowadays. Eighteen months ago a party
of American Seventh Day Adventists exploited
the Society and Paumotu Groups, and in their
schooner, the Pitcairn, visited the lonely little
island and converted the, people from•“ hard-cased
Christianity ” into Seventh Day Adventism. The
new religion has proved too much. The mission
schooner brought, in addition to the new brand of
Terewth, dysentery, diphtheria, measles and in-
fluenza ; and now comes the news that many of
the miserable survivors* (about 70) have been
attacked with malignant typhoid, to which 12
persons have already succumbed, amongst them
the well-known Rosa Young.

Suggesting kinship with the vags.

There’s something in the new-chum’s lapse,

Suggesting mother’s love, perhaps.

DOMESTIC ECONOMY!
WHAT IS IT ?
DOMESTIC ECONOMY is primarily the art of feeding’ and clothing the family at as low a rate as possible,
without impairing the family digestion, or taking away the character of its members for being well and com-
fortably dressed. Domestic economy is not comprised in buying a bad article for sixpence when better can be
got for sevenpence ; but if the ruling price for the best is eightpence, and somebody comes along and offers it for
sevenpence, then it’s domestic economy to close with t lie merchant so offering. By all means study this great
and glorious science of social life, because its due and proper observance cannot fail to make poor people rich, and
rich ones richer. What say you ? Will you do your business at

A curious trouble has arisen in Melbourne
between a German named Yunker and another
German named Gurmppenberg. Yunker couldn’t
speak English, and he fell in love with a girl who
couldn't speak German. Consequently, he
engaged Gurmppenberg as intermediary, and for

WIFE: “Mrs, Jones was bidding against me, and I owed her a grudge.”
two weeks that Teuton sat beside the lovers and
translated their tender endearments in a gruff
voice to one another. At the end of the fortnight
they dispensed with Gurmppenberg and got
married, and their agent sued for £4O for work
and labour done, and was nonsuited. The Bul-
letin is distinctly of opinion that if there is any
justice on earth Gurmppenberg should have got
his money. If the girl was pretty then the job of
making love to her for two weeks on behalf of
another man, when he naturally wanted to be
making love to her himself, was a severe strain on
the constitution. And if the girl was ugly
the position was even more trying. Any man
who has sat for two weeks along with a red-haired
girl with a wart on her nose, and told her she was
a beautiful gazelle, knows the feeling, and when a
man has to tell her instead, in a hoarse, unim-
passioned voice, that another man says in a
foreign language that she is a gazelle, all the in-
terest goes out of it.

Dear Bulletin, — It would appear that at
least one Sydney stipendiary (at an annual salary
,of £850) has been in the habit of exacting a guinea
fee from confinees for every visit paid by him to
Darlinghurst Gaol for the purpose of granting
bail. To this extortion the Attorney-General has
put a stop. But it may now happen that when
the fiiends of a prisoner wait upon a stipendiary
after office-hours, they may be told that he is
“out,” and the detenu may have to wait in gaol
for bail until next day. Why cannot the prison
visiting justice reside in the neighbourhood and
attend to all bail cases—or why should not the
gaol governor be a J.P, with power (bail having
been given at the police-court) to accept bail
bonds?—F.

The hangman business is evidently falling
into disrepute. Roberts, the new Vie. strangler
and gaol-flogger, and the widow of his prede-
cessor, Jones, were recently accused, in Mel-
bourne, of taking a gold watch from a drunk and
putting in his pocket instead the brass “ ticker ”
of the late lamented hangman. Roberts was dis-
charged, the evidence being insufficient. Also, on
the same day, the two-year-old child of the
deceased was charged with being a neglected
infant. If the gallows business is ever going to
be made respectable the salary must be raised to
<£looo a year, and the offender must always be
hanged in evening-dress, with a flower in his
button-hole. Also, the hangman must appear in
evening-dress and white gloves, and wear his
rings outside his gloves.

TWO LETTERS.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
One was a garland of flowers from the bride,
And one was a wreath from the dead,
From the brow and the breast of two sisters, inside
The frailest of caskets they sped.
And they came unto me in the still eventide
When the glory of sunset had sped.
The darkness drew round and I bitterly cried,
In the night with the stars overhead,
©’er that garland of flowers from the brow of the bride
And that wreath from the breast of the dead—
And with me till death’s-day must ever abide
That mpmory of anguish and dread.
One told how in gladness and pleasure and pride
The fair Muriel had been wed,
And “dear little Marie hath sickened and died’’
Was all 'that the other one said—
Ah! one was a garland of flowers from the bride
And one was a wreath from the dead.

A GOOD STOVE.
A WORD OF CAUTION.
Everyone knows what a good stove is—at least,
the women do ; and every woman knows that, of
all the treasures of the household, a really first-
rate, reliable cooking-stove is the greatest desider-
atum in a house. A great many stoves are
advertised every year, many of which are like
jerry-built houses —thrown together to sell. A
word of caution is therefore necessary to intending
buyers, because there are few things so annoying
and vexatious as to buy a stove and then find that
it does not possess all the qualities that are neces-
sary to give complete and lasting satisfaction.
Now, the points in choosing a good stove are:—
1. Strong oast-iron frame.
2. Good draught.
3. Facilities to burn either wood, coal, or
even turf.
4. Simplicity of parts, and thus, easy to clean.
5. Duplicate parts kept in stock, so that
bieakages can be replaced at small cost
and without delay.
And if, in addition to these five points, you can
get a stove that is also an ornament to the kitchen,
all the better.
Price, of course, is a point, but that is a matter
which need scarcely be mentioned, since, if the
above points are combined in any stove, it would
be cheap at any price within reason.
It only remains for us to say that, with con-
fidence, we can honestly recommend “The
Housewife,” sold by Holdsworth, Macpherson
and Co., 250 George-street, Sydney, from -£3 10s.

M'Burney, Wallis & Co.'s Report.
M'Bumey, Wallis and Co. report: -The sales this week
were characterised by brisk bidding and, if anything, a
slight increase in prices. The wool offered was of the
description usual at this time of the year—viz., country
and local scoured and odd and inferior lots of greasy.
Judging from cables just received from our London
agents, Sydney prices are slightly-in excess of the home
market, and we fear those who shipped their wool last
season will have cause and leisure to repent their action.
The time lias come when “ Sell in Sydney " should be the
wool-growers’motto.
A considerable quantity of Queensland woq! wasoffered,
but owdng to its wasiy condition did not receive much
attention from buyers, and a number of lots were passed
in, ow ners clinging too milch to values received at this
time last year, when the market was firmer and the wool
in much more attractive condition. We did not sell this
week, but will offer a good catalogue in the next fort-
nightly series.

Almost all the Australian reconstructed banks
reported enthusiastically that the first call had met with
a splendid response; in the worst oases it was paid up
in full, and in many instances considerable sums were
received on account of the second call. That second call
is now about due in most instances, and the enthusiasm has
ail evaporated. By the time the eighth call comes along
the annual meeting of the average reconstructed bank
will be a pandemonium, and amid the general frenzy a lot
of strange circumstances will come to light.

At a recent general meeting of shareholders in a
certain re-constructed bank, a bondholder clenched his
speech—an all-round onslaught upon the management—
with the following:—“Our general manager. Mr. Blank
Dash, is hated by the bank’s clients, feared by the officials
over whom circumstances have put him, and is regarded
generally as the weakest item in the bank’s constitution.”
However, the newspapers don’t report such things; it

sort of thing goes on we shall have ordinary defendants of

Certain unpleasant facts came to light at the
last annual meeting of the New Zealand Fire Insurance
Co This is a big institution with a reserve fund of
£235,000, which fund, it transpires, is largely invested in
shares of various companies. These shares are mostly
of the ordinary contributing kind, and when the com-
panies begin to burst up, and the calls come in, there
will be exceedingly pleasant times for the N.Z. Co.’s
shareholders. In one 00. alone they are contingently
liable for £230,000 in calls, and as the concern in question
is in rather a depressed condition the prospects are not
any too bright. This original way of investing the reserve
fund makes that alleged reserve a huge liability instead
of an asset, and as the N.Z. Fire Insurance is an un-
limited 00., the shareholders may, in some time of
panic, find themselves with their savings and their capital
all gone in one act, and their 00. burst up, and a million
or so of liabilities on hand as well.

The Colonial Mutual Insurance Society got an
excellent “ad.," the other day, in London. A wealthy
citizen lodged a proposal for £5OOO, but when on his
way to the office to be medically examined he fell under a
train and was killed. The society’s prospectus was found
in his pocket, and was duly mentioned in the papers
among the other particulars of the sad ooourrenoe.
Then the management naturally wrote to correct the
altogether unfounded rumour that the proposal was
made under table J when it was really under table A, or
something to that effect, and drew more attention to
Itself. All of which means business. You have to adver-
tise even on a corpse, nowadays, if you want to keep
abreast of the rush.

The Bank of Australasia announces a dividend
of 74 per cent., and shows a satisfactory profit of £60,606.
This is not quite up to some of the brilliant results of
former years, hut it is a remarkably good showing at such
a time as the present. The bank has £4,000,000 in cash
and Government securities, and of its reserve fund of
£BOO,OOO, half-a-million is invested in British consols,
where it can be readily found when wanted. The Austra-
lasia has always been an intensely conservative institu-
tion, and its conservatism has done it good service during
the crisis. There is a trifling shrinkage in business, as a
matter of course, but there is no sudden and awful drop
In the assets, as has been the case with most banks of
late, and the shares are remarkably steady.

The spiritualists who started boring for coal at

case.

The mining-talk of the day centres round the
Mount Huxley, Tasmania, alleged discovery-indicated in
The Bulletin some weeks ago. The syndicate consists
Of 300 paid-up shares of £250 each, whereof the original
owner, Mr. Barker (of Ebsworth and Barker, Sydney),
takes 100 for his interest, with £BOOO cash from the
£25 000 subscribed by the public, to whom 100 shares were
•old’. The other hundred shares are held by Mr. P. P.
Samuel, the promoter. The shares were last week quoted
in Sydney at £l2OO, and fractional interests only were
being sold by the “ velvet ” brigade. The money was
fully subscribed at the first meeting, but shareholders will
be entitled to a refund of their cash, minus a small
amount lor expenses, in the event of the experts sent over
by them not confirming the original reports. Various
Statements are being made as to the mine s richness.
Late news is that the Tasmanian Government
geologist has gone to inspect the show, which, it is said,
has long been known as ground running about 3dwts.,
and which would only pay if treated on a huge scale.
Should thls'be true everything will depend on how much
there is of it. Twelve shillings a ton in gold is quite good
enough where there is plenty of dirt and you are able
to shove it into the mill at Is. a ton.
Should Mount Huxley only turn out a 3-d wt.
affair instead of 10-dwt., as believed by the promoters,
the ill-luck of the children of Israel In gold-mining will
receive yet another awful illustration. But should it pay
10-dwt., then about 40 sons of Judah will take an early
departure for Park Lane.
The publio would shriek with laughter if they
only knew the exact style and qualifications of the
“ experts ” who are occasionally allowed to boom mines
in big type.

Three mines at Belmore, N.S.W., including the
Bluejacket, have been amalgamated and floated in London
for £150,000. How much working capital this means is
unstated. In the district, at Boney Rocks, there is a
mine called the Lady Burdett Coutts. Which somehow
recalls that when Pritchard Morgan first went to England
betook with him a Charters Towers mine called “The
Scotchman,’’ and set about floating it, “Scotchman I”
said the broker, “Scotchmen aren’t popular in London,
Call it the Disraeli.” And he did,

What is said to be a very big thing in gold is
being carefully shepherded in a remote region of North
Queensland. It was found by a man now dead and a
Victorian crowd have fitted out an expedition to size it
up. But somebody has got ahead of them.

The Francis Reward mine, Cue, Murchison,
lately crushed (Otis ball mill) 2120z5. from 50 tons of
stone ; a further crushing of 7 tons through the oo.’s own
three-head stamper battery returned 38oz. gold—average
about 4oz. Bdwts. per ton.

Junction (8.H.) makes a profit of .£916 10s. for
half-year to March 31. Previous half-year’s surplus was
£4267. Ore raised during the half-year was 550 tong car-
bonate and 5957 tons sulphide - 2240 tons sulphide were
sold abroad and 2698 tons, with only 483 tons carbonate,
were smelted. No other Broken Hill mine has turned its
sulphide to such good account.
* * * *
The J unction Co. recently effected an indepen-
dent 10 per cent, all-round reduction, the second since
the strike, and, curiously, the larger mines have not yet
followed suit. Said that the Proprietary directors,
during their recent visit of inspection, discussed a further
reduction and that Manager Howell opposed it, wherefore
it was abandoned ! In the face of Western allurements,
says Howell, it is already difficult enough to retain good
men.
* * « «
South Australian Government has reduced the
rates for carriage of sulphides from Broken Hill to Port
Adelaide from 21s. Bd. to 15s. 6d. per ton, carbonate rates
to remain at the old figure. The reduction gives an
impetus to sulphide treatment at the seaboard and
export, and will be compensated for by the increased
tonnage of ore carried. Even 15s. 6d. per ton for 333
miles is high. S.A, only relaxes the screw on the score of
expediency.
« • • •
Block 10 Warren, who has already one costly
and elaborate sulphide experimental plant hung up, is to
the fore with an improved jigging process, for which he
claims the practical solution of the sulphide problem.
The difficulty is, as usual, with the slimes. The long-
suffering shareholders, who have provided the where-
withal for many experiments, will be rejoiced at the
prospect of the profitable treatment of their immense and
at present valueless sulphide dump, especially as the rich
carbonate in the mine is nearly all gone now.

Broken Hill returns, week to May 17 : Proprie-
tary, 11,863 tons ore, 334,7620 z. silver ; Block 10, 277 tons,
97600 z. The Proprietary is putting through some extra
rich stuff at present, which causes a temporary rise in
average yields. Shares up to 51s. 6d.

Baker’s Creek, at Hillgrove, has crushed 460
tons for 500 oz.; Sunlight, 670 tons, 2490 z. ; Eleanora,
239 tons, 550 z., and 7 tons concentrates. At Parkes the
Old Bushman tributors have got 2430 z. from 120 tons—
good enough.
* • • •
As Wyalong goes up the crushing average goes
down. The 3oz. and 4oz. stone is getting scarce, and
Charters Towers may have a chance in the race yet. The
latest Barmedman returns are 5560 z. from 407 tons, but
“ some owners decline to furnish their returns for publi-
cation ” —doubtless because they don’t want to be
pestered with speculators anxious to buy the shows.
However, there is ample warrant for hope that good work
will return good profits once the skiting corps and the
booming brigade are silenced.
• * * «
Gibbons and party, prospecting on Bolte’s
selection, about 2J- miles from “old” Wyalong, struck
something which, up to date, seems the nearest approach
to a well-defined reef yet found ; it shows good gold and
is 2ft. thick. Bolte’s claim it was that showed such
a splendid blow a few weeks aero. Wyalong threatens to
be at least an excellent “ tucker’’-field.
• • ♦ •
The first death on Wyalong occurred on Mon-
day, May 14th. Andrew Mathieson, the deceased, suc-
cumbed to enteritis, possibly caused by bad water. The
bands of Perry’s and Montgomerie’s circuses led the pro-
cession, playing the “ Dead March in Saul,” and about
400 persons followed the corpse.
• • « •
Some idea of the exodus from the east can be
gained from the fact that 106 tram-conductors and grip-
men have cleared to Coolgardie from Melbourne alone.
None of them had less than £4.0, and each withdrew his
£5 deposit lodged with the company, which had thus to
payout £530. The flesh-pots of a tramway company are
no great shakes, but they are no doubt sighed for by this
time. A Bulletin correspondent saw two gins cleaning
knives at the back of a leading Coolgardie hotel the other
day. Gne was spitting on the knives while the other
polished them on the board. The best bungle the Govt,
water-supply officials have made yet seems to have been
sinking the large new dam on an abandoned lease. An
enterprising miner has jumped the lease, applied for
forfeiture, and enclosed the dam. He appears to have
law on his side; and though the water-supply is franti-
cally scratching its head, the miner remains firm.

26740 z. The Mountain Maid has struck it rich at Croydon
with a 4ft. reef.

The Jubilee, Croydon (Q.), is, we hear, working
an 8-ft. 15dwts. lode. Capital and machinery are ajj
that are wanted (with economical mine-management) to
make It a valuable property. At present It is in the hands
of tributors.

Mountain Maid United, Croydon (Q.), on which
nearly £20,000 capital has been expended in seven years,
besides another £3OOO proceeds from sales of gold, at last
threatens a div. Last crushing, 130 tons, averaged
24dwts. gold worth £3 3s. Bd. per oz. from 4ft. vertical
reef. One of the very few mines on this field which is
being properly opened up.

By the end of June the largest cyanide plant in
Australasia will be completed at Croydon (Q.); capacity,
4000 tons per month. It is to treat 60,000 tons tailings,
the property of the Croydon Quartz C. Co. Previous
assays and practical cyanide tests promise a gross return of
28s. per ton. Only 3600 odd shares in 00. which have risen
from £2 to £4, buyers.

The excellent yields from the Brilliant Block
mine are infusing new life into Charters Towers, remarks
Mr. Alan B. Bright. The April returns were 1680 tons
for 2602 oza., and a div. of £2500. The May dividend of
9d. (£3750) has been declared, and there are £2OOO at
fixed deposit and a credit balance in current account
besides. It is probable that the directors will restrict the
dividend to 6d. a month (equal to £2500) in future and
build up a strong reserve with any surplus.
• * • *
About 100 tons are being raised monthly in the
Brilliant Extended, 0. Towers. This is the first stone
treated in Queensland from below 2000 feet.
♦ ♦ * *
The April returns from the Mosman mines, C.
Towers, were 1147 tons for 1176 ozs. ; of which the North
Australian gave 725 ozs. from 388 tons.
« « « •
Mill’s Day Dawn United yielded for March
3615 tons for 3579 ozs. ; divs. were as usual, £7500, Reef
in some places 15 feet thick; monthly output, between
3600 and 4000 tons.
* ♦ • *
The Old Imperial, a 25-acre lease, says Alan
Bright’s circular, has provided the sensation of the month
on 0. Towers. The upper levels were little more than
payable, but after water level the stone improved greatly,
and the last 430 tons crushed gave 9700z5., and provided a
div. of 6d., equal to £1250. Another 250 tons are now at
grass, and it is expected to put through 1000 tons before
stopping.

With the big cyanide plant at work during

True Blue block, Croydon, is working a big
2Joz. reef, averaging 4ft. The value of the gold, however,
is most unsatisfactory, proceeds from last crushing only
averaging 335. per oz. A couple of hundred to credit at
bank, and 600 tons stone at grass, give hopes of 3d. div.

Kapai-Yermont gold-mine, M.L., is erecting
dry-crushing and cyanide plant. An enormous quantity
of stone is in sight. As the cost of mining and treatment
is reckoned at but 255. per ton the claim should soon be
on the div.-list.

Last Saturday, at Parke and Lacy’s ore-crush-
ing works, Sydney, saw a working test of the Storer-Lacy
filtration process. Meant for use in the wet extraction
of gold (by chlorine or cyanide) it was claimed, by the
joint inventors, that by means of their mechanical
improvements, they could work off in a week what another
plant of similar size would take a year to do. The trials
—under the auspices of the Engineering Association of
N.S.W.—were successful, and it was generally recognized
that Storer-Lacey had upheld their statements. The
mechanical idea is simple and has not a moveable part to
get out of gear. There is scope enough for such things,
and should further trials maintain the result of Saturday’s
experiments many a struggling mine will arise and call
the inventors blessed.

A letter from Geraldton, Westralia, to a Sydney
man :—Dear Sir, —Arrived yesterday after a tiresome
journey, via all ports. Steamers coming this way are
packed like herrings in a barrel. Well-dressed and clean-
looking women were buttonholing men in the streets of
Melbourne to pay their passages to the new'field, and with
a marked degree of success. I got a passage in the s.s.
Adelaide, which, being a “swagger” boat, soon filled
from stem to stern with men and women of all sorts and
conditions. One lofty lady who kept aloof all the voyage
showed her hand at Freemantle. Some of her luggage
being missing, she declared that if the blanked box didn’t
turn up, the double-blanked captain would have to blanky
well pay for the blank thing. An old iniquity present
suggested that it must be her medicine-chest, at which
she broke out in a fresh place and much delighted the
company. The Great Australian Bight was at its worst,
and an Orient liner 24 hours before us had a fearful hand-
ling. The Bulimba, eight hours later, had to stop her
engines for 24 hours. We kept going all the time, but
were dead to the world for 36 hours. When things
smoothed, we began to take one another out of twist.
Not more than four persons on board who didn’t make a
full statement of their affairs, several times repeated.
There was a scarcity of old-digger element, not more
than a dozen. The rest comprised amateur syndicate
men, sharks and prostitutes. A tough lot, so much so
that one of the officers publicly stated that we were the
hardest-mouthed cargo to date—could only hope, at the
most, that some of us would keep out of gaol. Of the 990
odd dumped this week about 50 go to Cue ; all the rest to
Coolgardie. As far as I can observe, the coastal slope is a
howling wilderness-sand everywhere, and plenty of it.
They tell me there are fertile patches w ithin, but, judging
by the quantity of produce imported, I beg leave to
doubt it. Such stock as I’ve seen are nothing but
hat-racks. I now understand what has retarded progress.
Without minerals, the coast from Albany to Geraldton,
some 500 miles, is simply impossible. I’m told Cue is
distant 270 miles from Geraldton. Of this, 15 miles are
by train, 25 by contractor’s trucks to Mullew a, where they
fire you out on a sand-plain to do the best you can. Here
real trouble begins. There are three modes of transit
from this point to the field. First, by mail-coach in nine
days, £7 10s.; assist with the horses, find and cook your
own tucker. Next, by camel In 16 days, 3d. per lb.
for swags, find your own boots and walking-power. Last
by horse-dray, at current rates. In very few cases can
you obtain a cooked meal on the road. I have chosen
camels as the best and cheapest, but this must be the
subject of my next letter. While at the office of Messrs.
Falz and Thag Mahomet, I was shown some quartz from
Fortune of War mine. It is mean, white, sugary stuff
but, by Jove, there is gold in it. You will see by
papers sent that they are heaving forward. The natives
here resent our coming, call us generally “T’other
Siders,” and abuse us generally. They damn gold, the
diggers, the eastern colonies, and, above all, the competi-
tion that came with the rush of people. Formerly they
ran a monopoly, and were masters of the position—money
came In without exertion. The new order is crushing
them out, and they are Just mad. In the near future the
eastern people will run the show, Government,and all.
Since leaving the mother colony, I’ve met nothing but a
legal system of highway robbery without arms. In King
William-st., Adelaide, I saw a varied assortment of
specimens from nearly everywhere, and it is quite true
that Hill End takes the cake.—Yours, etc., D. M‘K.
The Sydney boot-strike ended almost as
spon as begun. The recalcitrant non-unionists
yielded ; the masters gave an assurance that wages
would be maintained, and everything is cheerful
again. A decided triumph for union principles.
Thus Brisbane Courier: “Labour de-
tached from Liberalism is political Anarchism.”
Listen, Courier : “ Liberalism detached from
Labour (in Bananaland, at least) is a political
cipher 1”
There is a pleasing contrast between the
reasonable, conciliatory tone recently adopted by
Glassey towards Lilley and the democratic-party
he represents, and the ill-judged tirades against
all who are not “straight Labour,” indulged in
by certain Queensland Labour-members. Glassey
recognises that “support for concessions” is a
motto likely to gain more in 12 months than
“Socialism in Our Time ” will gain in 12 years.
The latest clever capture by the police is
their finding of John Sivindell, of Mungundi,
(N.S.W.). Sivindell broke gaol, where he
was confined on a charge of owning a horse
which didn’t belong to him, and the police started
out after him. They didn’t find him, but one
morning Sivindell wandered into their camp, and,
mistaking them for a party of shearers, he gave
them full particulars. When he had finished, the
officers rose up and made a really brilliant arrest.
If he hadn’t given them the aforesaid particulars
they would probably have given him a square
meal in their own kind-hearted fashion, and sent
him on his way. The fact that, out of the eleven
policeman who met the supposed Barraba mur-
derer, no less than six fed him as he passed, shows
that the N.S.W, “copper” is a very decent
Samaritan, whatever else he may be.
According to the cable, somebody, signing
himself “ A Sydney Worker,” writes to London
Spectator stating that 99 per cent, of the misery
in Australia is due to strikes. That “ worker ”is
probably the same corpulent landlord who used
to sign himself “The Wife of a Forced Striker”
in Sydney Telegraph. The person of the W. E.
Abbott type is much given to this kind of foolish-
ness, and has a vague idea that the public is
deceived thereby. Some day, when the present
writer has time to spare, he is going to fix up a
frightful diatribe of the most violent Domain or
Yarra-bank orator stamp, demanding the entire
abolition of private property. Then he will sign
it “A Sydney Capitalist,” and send it to the
papers, and await results with a grin of fatuous
contentment upon his countenance.
The collected “ poems ” of E. B.
Loughran, a Melb. journalist, have been pub-
lished by Melville, Mullen, and Slade. The bid
for immortality is unwise as the “poems” are
unworthy. Commonplace in thought, awkward
and inharmonious in treatment, they are merely
the mechanical utterance which anybody may
compass with a certain amount of culture and a
certain amount of pains. Interest enough to
fertilise the arid columns of the average news-
paper does not justify addition to the terrors of
below-the-average books. “ Sonnets ” with seven
rhymes in fourteen lines (p. 31), abominable and
unacknowledged paraphrases of Brunton Stephens
(p. 57), and Kendall (p. 118), with imitations of a
score of others, couplets like (p. 94): —
With hopeless anguish Dante mourns for his Beatrice,
By Musa’s magic crystal again his love he sees !
give to Mr. Loughran’s book some'right to rank
as a literary curiosity, but cannot give it literary
merit.
Dear Bulletin, — The Law’s first object is,
is, or shonld be, not to make punishment, severe,
but to make it certain. Capital punishment fails
as a deterrent, firstly, because deliberate murderers,
like other criminals, reckon either on not
being found out, or on not caring a rap when they
are found out (this according to whether their
motive is gain or revenge), and, also, because all
men think themselves immortal until they hear
the handcuffs click. To what end would the
execution of Montgomery and Williams conduce?
It wouldn’t stop burglary any more than hanging
used to stop larceny when the stealing of 40s.
worth was a capital offence; it wouldn't make
burglars (who are, and must be, men of nerve and
resolution, playing a desperate game) any the
more ready to surrender when they got into
a tight place—it would but make them kill where
now they only stun, in that one may just as
well be hanged for a sheep as for a lamb,
for killing as for half-killing. It would only make
jurors, when they .had presented to them by an
adamantinely-unelastic law the alternatives of
murder and perjury, commit the lesser crime, which
is perjury, and which, under the circumstances,
would not be a crime at all. N.S. Wales and
Tasmania are the only white-man’s countries where
the law exacts the death-pebalty for an uncom-
pleted homicide. It would, therefore, appear (1)
that the law-makers of these countries are more
brutal than the rulers of other countries, or (2)
that the people are so brutal as to need brutal
treatment. There is a third alternative—that,
broadly speaking, the two provinces are ruled by
hangmen and populated by criminals. As a
matter of fact, the existence of this law is entirely
due to the circumstances that New South
Wales began as a convict colony and that
its socially, politically and legally-powerful ex-
Chief-Justice who, with his legal apprentices
and hangers-on, engineered the present blood-
soaked code through a Legislature so ignoralht
and brutal as to be worthy of the most
savage traditions of Lagland, was Solicitor-
General of Yan Diemen’s Land in the bad
old days of 60 years ago. People don’t
generally know that in New South Wales
—where a decent man can, on the simple
dictum of a couple of mere magistrates, be triced
up and skinned alive for writing “John Smith ”
in lead pencil on the wall of a public building,
the offence of “defacing a public building ” being
floggable—there are more offences punishable by
death (nine capital crimes are in the Botany Bay
code of 1884) than are thus punishable under the
united criminal codes of all Europe and of all
America put together.—Yours, Deeming W.
Gabbett. " ’

“ Widow has furnished bed and sitting-
room for ladies or others.” — Melb. Ad.
Q. agricultural lecturer, Shelton, “ would
substitute for all the existing Land Acts this single
clause: ‘ Any citizen of Queensland, 21 years of
age, the head of a family, shall be entitled to 160
acres of Crown lands, wherever found, after a
payment of survey fees, and five years of bona-fide
occupation and cultivation.’” Good; but it
doesn’t go far enough. The average citizen would
simply sell his holding as soon as he got the deeds,
and start to cultivate another. Free land should
go with permanent residence for small areas ;
with permanent cultivation for large; in default,
forfeiture.
G. W. Pope, one of the seceded New
Australians, writes to S.A. Register :—
One man named Kempson, who was on board with the
pioneers, but was put back on account of measles in his
family, decided on reaching Asuncion that he would not
go any further. He is a man of sixty years quite, with a
young wife and four children, all of whom are under six
years of age. He went to Lane and asked him for a trifle
of money with which to face the world again. The old
chap had paid into the association £143, but Lane told
him that he would not give him a red cent, whereupon
the old man promptly knocked him down.
Pope writes that they have discovered quite a new
disease in Paraguay, “ chu-ehu,” a form of fever-
and-ague which kills off foreigners in a most
reliable and expeditious manner, but this has
probably been “expelled” by order of Lane.
Pope is evidently a bitter pill, and has laid him-
self out to burst up Rue-Australia. His letters
are appearing in papers all over the place.

CHARLES PINHEY, Registrar-General,
“ His Honor the Honourable Sir John
Madden, Knight, Chief Justice,” is the style pre-
scribed by the present occupant of the Vic. Chief
Justiceship. His predecessor was “George Higin-
botham, Chief Justice.”
Cable announces that the English State
Church parson, who habitually blew a whistle in
the pulpit, has been declared a lunatic. And yet
the English State Church depends almost entirely
on the assumption that some one will blow a
trumpet presently.
Property and the Tasmanian Club were
badly beaten in the return of F. W. Piesse for the
Legislative Council district of Buckingham, over
the head of Dr. Butler, who ran with all the club,
family, and landed influence that could be
roused in the little island.
The lady who asserted that the Yic.
Minister for Lands was drunk based her assump-
tion on the statement that he had asked someone,
“ What the hell he was doing there I” To
those who know Maclntyre, this will not be taken
as proof. Mac., who swears like a trooper, has
been known to curse a village-settler into outer
darkness while he was feeling in his own private
pocket for half a sov. to give him. Victoria might
advantageously change her Premier, but not her
Minister for Lands.
Rev. J. Chalmers telegraphs, with a proud
and holy burst of joy, that he has been up the Fly
River, New Guinea, and hasn’t killed any
natives: —
He had no arms, and landed at each village, viz.—
Pirsame, Adura, Throga and Baiaasarara. The natives
were armed everywhere, or had their arms handy on the
hanks, but nowhere was a single arrow fired. The real
fighting chiefs Mr. Chalmers had on board for two days
and one night, and they introduced him to other tribes.
Everywhere they say that they did not want to fight the
several expeditions, but were simply bearing down on
them to be the first to get a piece of cloth or a bit of iron.
Mr. Chalmers, with the Miro, “simply steamed
amongst them.” Brave man ! Governor Mao-
gregor has also simply steamed among them on
four different occasions, but always with fifteen
or twenty truculent Fiji policemen, armed with
Winchesters, and itching to hang some poor black
devil who has fired an arrow or hove a spear at
the “ Kovana.” The missionary also took care to
mention this
Each expedition had to use- firearms, and by each
several natives were killed.
Years ago, when the trading steamer Vesta was in
New Guinea, her chief means of defence was
steam-pipes laid along her sides. When the
niggers, in canoes, got troublesome, steam hissed
fiercely from hundreds of perforations, and scared
the would-be boarders. Mr. Chalmers might de-
vise some means by which the Word could be
fired at the Fly River people—per rocket-tube, for
instance.
Sydney Telegraph has another fearsome
groan on the evils of Protection :
A fine illustration of whom Protection protects just
comes to hand from the Richmond, where the local
industry of sugar production is swelled out to a much-be-
lauded fatness by a£s a ton duty. In the Lismore Court
the other day there was a case involving the earnings of
sugar-farm labourers, when it came out that the average
pay for white men working in the caneflelds is not more
than I6s. a week. The Police Magistrate, after the facts
had been put before him, took the responsibility of saying
that these workers are worse off than “ any in the world,”
which, considering the kind of labour they have to per-
form and the limited purchasing power fof their wages, is
probably true. Shearing wet sheep at £1 a thousand is
bliss in comparison to cutting sugarcane and dodging
snakes oh the sweltrous delta of a North Coast river at
16s. a week. Yet this is the w T age yielded to labour by the
one great New South Wales industry which protection
has to boast of. To keep up the sugar-growing industry
every member of the community, from the fashionable
consumer of afternoon tea at Potts Points to the swag-
man boiling his billy out in the Never Never, and from
the jovial toddy-swigger at the swell club to the school-
boy with his penn’orth of lollies, is put under tribute.
The result is that “ employment is found for local labour”
at pay which, according to those who ought to know, is
lower than that earned by any other class of white men
in the world. Where does the £5 per ton go to, then?
The interesting point just here is that the afore-
said £5 a ton was one of the old Freetrade duties
put on by the party which the Telegraph has
boomed in season and out of season—mostly out of
season. Therefore the question is—why did the
Telegraph not point to these same facts three
years ago as a ghastly evidence of the futility of
its own revenue-tariff policy? The sugar duty is
the Telegraph’s one awful example of the horrors
of Protection, yet if it is Protection then the old
Parkes-M‘Millan gang were Protectionists, and
the Telegraph is trying all it knows to boost
ihem back into office. This discrepancy wants a
lot of explanation. Also, by the way, the wages
are not “16s. a week,” but “16s. a week find
rations,” which is bad enough, but, all the same,
makes the above yarn a very mean perversion.
One of the most prominent and adventur-
ous South Sea traders, the taciturn Captain
Donald Macleod, is dead. Bub a few weeks ago
he was in Sydney and bought a fine vessel, the Sir
John Franklin, and the news of his death at
Noumea startled those of his friends who knew of
what tough stuff he was built. Macleod was,
probably, the best-known —and, in some quarters,
the best-hated—man in the Western Pacific.
With the natives his influence was extraordinary,
and but for him the French New Hebrides co.,
which, till lately, was practically Donald Macleod
himself, would never have acquired its present
local prestige. The old man’s undeviating support
of French v. British interests aroused the bitterest
hostility against him, particularly from the mis-
sionaries, who many years ago tried to have him
deported from the group, and Captain (now
Admiral) Markham, a blustering naval officer,
once visited the New Hebrides to seize the famous
old trader for alleged blackbirding in his equally
famous schooner, the Donald Maclean. Hearing
that charges had been made in the Commons
against him, and that a man-o’-war was after him,
the old man, in his quiet, sombre way, went aboard
and, to the speechless indignation of the mission-
aries, returned to his vessel again without having
been eitjier hanged or shot. His escapes from death
in his earlier South Sea career were many and
narrow. Once, while taking some trade out of a
box amongst a crowd of natives, he just raised his
hand in time to save his skull_ being cloven by a
tomahawk, and came off with the loss of one
finger. Although he had another tomahawk buried
in his shoulder he got his boat’s crew away in
safety. With the natives, in after years, the
name of “Maklau” was something to conjure
with—simply because he was a man of iron nerve,
whose straight-dealing policy was thoroughly
understood by them, although never by his
many jealous white colleagues —who, however,
were always eager enough to invoke his aid when
their skins were in danger. He accumulated a
considerable fortune, but lived hard and never let
anyone, white or nigger, do him out of a cent.
His death will be hailed with joy by that section
of the white community in the New Hebrides who
live in dread of French annexation, and are
always making frantic appeals (through the dour
and pious Australian syndicates that own them,
body and soul) for Australia to arise and wipe out
the ruffianly Frenchmen who want to have a finger
in the New Hebrides pie.

William Epps, secretary of N.S.W. National
Ass, lias published a valuable abstract of the
Land Systems of Australasia. The peculiarity
of the book is that it isn’t finished. Mr. Epps
piles up such suggestive facts as these :-r-
There is no country in the world with a similar popula'
lion in which such immense areas [of land] are held by
private individuals [as in Australasia].
The operations of the land systems of these three pro-
vinces for 65 years in ontf province [N.S.W.], and a little
over 50 years in two others [M.L. and S. A.] have resulted
in 1250 persons securing almost one-half the total alienated
area, while 105,000 others between them possess only just
*bout one-fourth of the total extent alienated.
While the population of all the provinces has increased
rapidly, the public estate has been passing at a terrific
rate into private hands, cultivation has been practically
at a standstill, and the number of persons engaged in
winning frbm the soil an increase quite dispropor-
tionate to the increase of the total population.
Then Mr. Epps stops short. He sets down the
sum and doesn’t add it up. He strips and spits
on his hands and doesn’t show fight. He never,
never dares to say that these things shriek for
the direct taxation of land monopolists. It is a
bad thing to be tethered to the tail of the
National Ass !
“ They who, under certain circumstances,
do not lose their intellect, have none to lose.”
Cairns suffered terribly during the recent
storms and floods. Many verandahs were blown
down, also a building tenanted by the Young
Men’s Christian Association. The only contents
of the latter building (remarks Cairns Argus) was
a pack of cards. Another delusion gone!
The use of shearing-machines in Australia
has so far failed to pecuniarily advance the
squatter. Over a wide average of stations it has
been found that sliearing by machine -coats some-
thing over Is. Gd. per 100 more than by hand. In
time it is hoped machines will be worked more
economic illy, but" up till the present they fall
greatly short of expectations.
Dear Bulletin,— The champion mean
man! Some months ago, a half-starved swag-
man, passing a selector’s house, saw a man wheel-
ing bar row-load after barrow-lpad of quinces from
an orchard to a pig-stye. The stone-broke watched
him hungrily awhile, and at last plucked up
courage to ask for one. “ Begad,” was the reply,
“I can’t; I want ’em fer me pigs.”—Muff,
Bundarra.
“ H.”: “Higinbotham and Michie did not
suffer in their business through their politics.
Higinbotham made it his, perhaps, Quixotic prin-
ciple to do no private business when in office. As
soon as he returned to the Bar, while the acrimony
was yet high, he floated up again to his right
pos’tion. Michie, in ’6B, date of the cause celebre
mentioned in your article, got his full deserts. In
many fights, litigants don’t care twopence about
barristerial politics. Look at Syme and Furves.”
Can a greater blasphemy be uttered than
the following from W. T. Stead’s hysterical book
on Chicago? “If Christ came to Chicago and
were still of the same mind that he was when he
walked in Judea, he would have said the same
thing (as I, W. T. Stead) with probably greater
emphasis.” Stead, by providing against a possible
change of political and social views on the part of
Christ, proves that his reverence, of which he boasts
so much, is not even skin deep; and his ascription to
Christ of a probable lapse into the use of emphasis
of a pronounced character where he, Stead, was
able to hold control over bis language recalls the
maxim of the French critic: “Intellectual sots
are prone to emphasis.”
The riot in Sydney Presbytery must have
come as a painful surprise to all intelligent thinkers,
who assumed that the “ verbal inspiration of the
Bible ” theory had long ago been buried beside
the whale that swallowed Jonah, or thrown into
the apocryphal furnace which didn’t burn Shad-
rach. Tliese Bible idolaters can no longer excuse
their conduct on the score of ignorance. The
Book of the World lies open before their fairly
educated eyes. They cannot avoid looking at it,
and their affectation of stupidity is sheer impudence.
The Bible is a work of garbled Jewish history and
florid Eastern imagination, mostly written by
religious cranks, very badly translated, and altered
by all sorts of artful holy fathers, and still in
urgent need of a respectable editor. Creation was
already old-established before any Bible appeared
on the scene, and its various origins were so vulgar
that no heathen man of letters ever tried to collect
material for a preface.

“How politicians can dream of a united
and homogeneous Greater Britain, with the case
of Ireland staring us in the face, I do not under-
stand. England and Ireland will never be one, in
the sense that Wales and England or Scotland and
England are one, until there is dry land between
Li verpool and Dublin. Historians still attribute
the loss of our American colonies to the addlepated
policy of George 111. and his Ministers. A mis-
take ! America, by dint of her geographical
position, was bound, sooner or later, to drift away
from us, as in due time will Canada, Australia,
and the splendid South African States of which
Mr. Cecil Rhodes is now laying the foundation.
The Australian and the Afrikander are going to be
as typically different from John Bull as the
Yankee, or, for the matter of that, the Irishman.
There will be the bond of language, of course, but
that, as the example of America shows, is really
no bond at all. What binds Australia and South
Africa to the mother-country still is the fact that
the great majority of the colonists are British-
born and look upon England as “home.” Through
the flow of emigration Canada is in a similar
position. It will be otherwise when those great
dependencies of ours will have grown their own
population. There will arise in due time a king
who knows not Joseph. In other words, the
great-grandchildren of the English immigrants in
Canada, Australia and South Africa, owning, as
they will do, a strong admixture of Other blood,
will ask why their local interests should be sacri-
ficed to other interests which they hear of dis-
tantly from over the sea, and it needs no great
insight into human nature to know what answer
they will make to their own question.”— London

OFF TO THE DIGGINGS !
Slash —lash—onward we dash,
And away to the diggings we go.
From thb East and the West on our fortunate
quest—
There is wealth for the winning, we know.
We’ll work like a black on the gold-hunting tack,
And when we’re all stiff with the toil,
To l>e supple and spry we know where to fly
To the aid of ST. JACOBS OIL.
It isn’t all beer and all skittles,
This digging for gold in the mine,
With a shortage at times in your “ wittles,”
And the water as costly as wine.
When tropical rains bring rheumatical pains,
Your chance of enjoyment to spoil,
Then the miner’s best friend, from all pain to
defend,
Is a dose of ST. JACOBS OIL.
There’s plenty to do and to suffer
Ere a sight of the gold can be won ;
For your claim may pan out a rank duffer,
And yield but a grain to the ton.
Disappointments in life are distressingly rife,
And fortune your efforts may foil.
But there’s one thing we trust though all else may
go “bust”—
We refer to ST. JACOBS OIL.

A Few Sketches of His Interesting Life and
Work.
Herr Rassmussen, who is known throughout
the world as 44 The Celebrated Danish Her-
balist,” was born in the little kingdom of Den-
mark, shortly after its last disastrous war with
Germany. Mis parents being wealthy, and
belonging to the most influential class, he
received a first-class education, and displayed
exceptional talent in the science of botany and
botanical chemistry, and very soon surpassed
everyone of his fellow scholars in those sub-
jects, and eventually made the science of botany
his life-study.
Finding his native country too small, and its
flora too limited to extend his botanical re-
searches, he left for Australia, and landed here
in the beginning of 1879. His first object was
to learn the English language and become
familiar with the customs and habits of his
adopted country, as well as with its botanical
history and medicinal flora. Herr Rassmussen
had quite his share of the troubles and difficul-
ties which usually befall a newcomer in Aus-
tralia ; bub he soon overcame every difficulty,
and after five years’ travelling through all the
colonies, investigating every known Australian
medicinal plant, and discovering many new
ones, he eventually settled down permanently
in Sydney in 1883, and then commenced a
most noble mission—that of turning his most
wonderful botanical' discoveries to the benefit
and relief of suffering humanity. Herr Rass-
musseu succeeded in this gigantic undertaking
far beyond all expectations, and his name very
soon became a household word, not only in
every Australian camp, village and city, but
also throughout Europe, Africa and America.
Space will not permit to mention the
numerous cures effected by his now world-
famed Alfaline Remedies, suffice it to ■ say
that thousands of original testimonials may be
inspected by anyone at his Head Depot, 547
George Street, Sydney, many of which may
also be seen in "his celebrated work, 44 The
Natural Doctor. ”
There is no doubt whatever that Herr Rass-
mussen deserves all the success and praise which
he has met with, because he is a most scientific,
conscientious and genuine herbalist—his last
ten years record being so wonderful that his
remedies mupt have cured more human suffering
in that period than is usually effected by a
hundred average doctors in a similar number of
years. He does not bold any consultation
similar to .a doctor ; his whole business is
purely a Proprietary Herbal Remedy Business.
-He: simply-prepares a genuine herbal remedy
specially for the nerves, and another for the blood,
and so on, which can always be relied upon.
He prints on the box containing the remedy its
price and all advice as to doses and diet and
other particulars, arid advertises same, which
is the fairest, way possible to conduct a business
of this kind. Any information or particulars
desired are given or. sent absolutely free of
charge. Pamphlets are sent post free to any
person desiring one,’ containing all particulars
and many useful and valuable hints on health.
Herr Rassmussen has very large branches
of his extensive business in Melbourne,
Brisbane, Adelaide, Perth, Wellington (N.Z.),
and throughout the world. He is an
honorary member of several scientific socie-
ties, a gold fnedalist, diplomee and Hon.
Corr. Mem. ofMdie Acadenrie Parisienne des
luvenleurs,'France ; last year "'he received the
Honorary University degree of Doctor of
Philosophy ; in 1887, he was presented with a
magnificent gold nnedal by several of Iris cured
patrons in Sydney, and also awarded’ a silver
medal in Denmark, 1888, a bronze medal,
Melbourne, 1893 ; and in 1891 he issued his
44 Natural Doctor,” a herbal medical work of a
high standard for which he received great
praise from the press, and which is now trans-
lated into many languages.
Dear Bulletin, —The champion mean
man is a Northerner, whose servant - girl

claimed half-a-sovereign, on the grounds that she
used his flour and oven, and made the scones
during working hours.—M.G.
Human nature. Many Judges, who when
barristers took clerks’ fees (a kind of blackmail)
without a npise, and growled much when
they were not forthcoming, lose no opportunity of
speaking scathingly of the unseemly practice when
it comes before their judicial notice.
An .enthusiastic German has erected a
statue of Heine on the border-line of the German
territories in Africa. There the poet stands and
looks out over the voiceless desert, and the itching
lion comes and scrapes himself against the lone-
some monument. It is only a German who would
put a monument in such a situation. The Teuton
is a strange mixture of beer and sauer-kraut and
sentiment. . =
Melb. Herald is aiding the knock-out of
its evening rival by spending money lavishly.
Standard hasn’t improved its prospects of living
by changing its size and style, nor by employing
boy-reporting labour. Of the latter this is a speci-
men;—“lf people saw any line kinds of printing,
they turned round and said it was American ; but
there was just as good men here, who could do the
same work.”
Queensland Inspector of Animals Whit-
ing lately arraigned a small boy of 14 years, a
wood-hawker, for using a horse unfit for work.
When asked if he had any questions to ask, the
nipper promptly answered : “ Yus, I ’ave ! Didn’t
yer say las’ week as ’ow 4 Yer young blank—
I’ll’ave yer run in yet?’’’ “I did not,’’ confi-
fidently replied the inspector. “In yer hevidence
yer ses as ’ow the ’oss was covered with sores.”
“ Yes.” “Qn jvpt part of the ’oss was them
sores? ” “On his knees, on his hocks and on his
back and withers.” “Wasn’t them sores ’ealed ? ”
“ Not altogether.” 44 Was they runnin’sores ? ”
41 No; healing sores, not covered with hair—bare
scars.” 44 0 h! Well, if yer'ed was bald, would
yer 'ave a sore ’ed?” The Bench: “Case dis-
missed.” Boy, to Bench: “I s’pose I kin ’ave
my expenses.”
Editor Bulletin, The other day a
tornado burst over a N.Q. mining - camp.
By a tree which fell on a miner’s tent one man
was killed in his sleep; a second died later,
and the third was terribly mangled. The
nearest doctor was 30 miles away through a
N.Q. scrub. Creeks were in flood and the tropical
rain was pouring. A gang of miners set to work
to get their mate to the doctor. An advance-
guard, with scrub-hooks and axes, cut a way
ahead ; the bearers following with a stretcher on
which lay the cripple. For nearly two days the
men were without food. At length they reached
a selection and got out of the scrub. The floods
had left the farmer nothing but a bucket of
sweet potatoes. There were not enough to make a
square feed for all; so those of the party who
were knocked up refused the food that those who
were going on might have the more. At last the
bearers got their mate into the doctor’s hands, and
at latest accounts he was getting along well.
The papers haven’t yet recounted any 44 splendid
deed of heroism.” All the same, if heaven is
full of chaps like those, it must be a proper
camp.—X.
Editor Bulletin,— Why should 44 mug"
wumpery be henceforth named Heatonism,” a 8
per recent par. ? I protest that I • have no
connection whatever with the advertising Hen-
niker. Do you know who I am ? I come from
the States, and was born in N. Y. Tribune, Feb.
16, ’77, when J. H. Bromley in an editorial called
John A. Bogan 44 the Head Centre, the Hub, the
King Bin, the Chain Spring, Mogul, and Mug-
wump” of a current piece of corruption. In the
Gieveland-Blaine Presidential campaign of ’B4 the
N.Y- Sun took me up and applied me to the Inde-
pendent party ; and Horace Porter went so far as
to say that “a Mugwump is a person educated
beyond his intellect.” But I meant then, and mean
still, the man who sits on the rail, the trimmer;
and as such am an object of vulgar scorn, although
as Halifax, Charles ll,’s great trimmer, pointed
out, truth doesn’t lie in extremes, the best climate
trims between the frozen zone and the torrid, laws
trim between liberty and license, and God Himself
trims between mercy and justice. But 44 for public
life,” as Lytton says in “ The Caxtons,” a man
should be One-sided ; he must act with a party,
and a party insists that the shield is silver when,
if it will take the trouble to turn the corner, it
will see that the reverse is golden. Woe to the man
who makes that discovery alone while his party are
still swearing the shield is silver. Why ? Because
profanum vul<jus, which odi as much as Horace did,
is always in extremes, and hates the man who sees
the faults of both sides. - But you rnusn’t use me
as country, editors do the Yahoo, and call un-
deserving people by my name merely because it
sounds nasty.—Yours, Mugwump.

SPORTING NOTIONS.
A returned Sydney man says the N.S.W. inter-
provinoial eight was completely outpaced, but in any case
they wquld have had to be lengths faster than the winning
crew to have a show in the Sydney boat, which is next
thing to broken-backed. He lifted one end of her six
inches before she moved off the next trestle.
• • • •
How is it the Sydney interprovinoial eight-oar
crew is, year after year, so lamentably managed ? Fuller,
the Vic. builder, offered the N.S. Wales crew the loan of
a new boat, said to be the best eight-oar ever built in
Australia, but they declined, and rowed (probably for fear
of offending the donor, Mr. Sam Hordern) in a boat fully
501bs. heavier than the Victorians, which, after a mile had
been covered, sagged to such an extent that the middle
men could not clear their oars, and wriggled through the
water like an eel.

Dear Bulletin, —In your last you say you have
been asked to warn seafaring men of the state of the
shipping-trade at Singapore. But why go so far afield?
The colossally-rich owner of a yacht (resident south of the
equator) advertised for a skipper, one holding master’s sea-
faring certificate. The at one time master of a big
steamer, sick of want of employment, applied for the
billet. The owner told him the wages were three pounds
a week ; he would be expected to clean the brass-work on
board, wait at table when company were around, and
when nothing was doing at the yacht or the house, he
could put in a hand at the owner’s place of business.
“ You hold a master’s certificate ? ” continued the owner.
“ I do," replied the wrathful mariner, “ but 1 wish to God
I’d been a mentioning the owner’s line of trade.

The schedule of a well-known Melbourne sport-
ing journalist, recently through the court, makes extra-
ordinary reading and provides plenty food for reflection.
Assets, 10s.; liabilities, £1243 10s., of which £784 is for
money borrowed from friends. The friends number 63
and consist of racecourse proprietors, stipendiary stewards,
jockeys, trainers, barristers, handioappers, bookmakers,
and even newspaper men found a fiver now and then to
force upon this taking journalist. Victor Oohen, manager
of the ’93 Australian Eleven, lent him £B, but the schedule
does not state whether it came out of Vic.’s pocket or the
general fund of the Eleven. The sums borrowed run from
£7O from an auctioneer to £1 from Julian Thomas, “ The
Vagabond.”
• • * •
In certain circles it is considered mean to bid
against the owner when the winner of a selling-race is put
up. A little dispute over a matter of this kind is
engaging the attention of the Vic. turf.

Her recent achievements stamp Utter as one of
the very best animals on the Australian turf. She is

One objection laid against the tote is that
it would prevent owners giving their friends the
“straight griffin.” What odds? No backer is so un-
fortunate as he who gets information that the stable
money is on, when, as a rule, it isn’t. “ Good informa-
tion ” and “straight tips” are the curses of the average
backer.
• • ♦ »
A Maoriland scribe states that the totalisator is
like all gambling machines—if you play long enough, the
bank will have all the money. True, but to lose all your
money, you have to play longer with the tote than with
the bookmaker.
* • * *
The Bulletin, three years ago, ventured to
expres-j an opinion that it cannot yet retract. The totalis-
ator will not suppress the better-class bookmaker.
Owners, trainers, and their friends, all, in fact, who
possess good information, will insure a good price instead
of trusting to the chance of having it shortened by the
participation of outsiders.

A smart N.S.W. trainer has got hold of another

Not one of the leading Adelaide bookmakers
opened straight-out books on the local Birthday Cup
Meeting. They allege that as they cannot bet on the
course, anything but double books means losing money.
There is a steady immigration of pencillers to Westralia
and the other provinces. And now S.A. parsons (like the
fools moat of them are) are leading a crusade against the
more rational totalisator.

Australian football. Port Adelaide (S.A.) Club
complains that it only received £97 on May 5, as its share
of the gate. Why does an “ amateur ” football club want
more money for one Saturday afternoon’s' exercise by its
“ gentlemen ” players? This is surely introducing pro-
fessionalism into the game. Which is writ sarcastic.
• • * *
Nothing so illustrates the influence of betting on
sport than the decrease of distances in “ foot ” and horse
races. Sprinting has taken the place of mile contests and
six-furlong dashes of the old-time heats. The reason is
that, other things equal, a short is a better betting event
than a long race.

Wonderful how banging a horse’s tail will alter
its appearance. A well-known Sydney trotting mare,
recently “ rung in” in Maoriland, was, before she left
Sydney, held for half-an-hour by the man who had had
the handling, of her for months, and not recognised—
because she had had her tail banged. She won a couple
of races in Maoriland before they bowled her out.

A member of the last Australian Eleven was
recently describing a game of American football, at which
they were present in the States. It is a sort of bastard
Rugby, played with eleven a side, with no “ off-side,” as
in the Australian game. The college teams, once purely
amateur, are now almost wholly made up of retired prize-
fighters, and the “ butting,” necessary in the game,
causes the players to allow their hair to grow in a chrysan-
themum-like mop for protection. In addition to those
playing, a full team is kept in attendance, to take the
places of the killed and injured.
Melbourne bookmakers got a nasty knock over
the recent Hunt Club meeting. Ilium won the Handicap
Flat Race from Chiron, but Chiron’s party entered a pro-
test against the winner for crossing. The stewards met
and dismissed the protest, whereupon the “books" pro-
ceeded to pay Ilium. Nothing more was heard of the
protest till Monday morning, when the papers announced
that an appeal had been lodged with the V.R.C., and by
night the race was awarded to Chiron, and Israel knew its
doom. Now, as bets follow stakes, and Chiron gets the
stake, the bookies must pay his backers, and as for getting
back the “oof” which they have paid over Ilium—why,
it's as easy to extract butter from a dog’s throat than
money from a cash punter.

“ The Flying Pigeon ” is a recent spieling-trick
which “takes down" both “tug" and “ hot member.”
The operator, apparently in a boisterous condition,
appears amidst a bar full of people. From the ticket-
pocket of his coat dangles ostentatiously a piece of red
tape. The “buttoner,” with many winks at the assembly,
and much apparent finesse, tugs out the tape, to which is
attached a folded envelope. The operator then tempor-
arily quits the scene, and the “buttoner” remarks: “I
wonder what that boozy cove has tied up here.” All
draw round, and the “ buttoner ” finds the packet to con-
tain a threepenny piece. This he hands to one of the
lookers-on,*and saying “Now for a lark,” rolls up the
envelope and drops it on the floor. The operator returns,
looking about disconcertedly for his lost packet, spies it
at last, and then joyously exclaims: “1 wouldn’t have
lost that for a tenner. It contains a coin given to me as a
keepsake by my girl.” The “ buttoner” tips a wink to
the company, and promptly bets the operator that it
doesn’t contain a coin. The pigeons chip in, of course,
betting on a certainty as they think, but when the
envelope is opened a second 3d. concealed in a corner is
brought to light and everybody “ falls in."

Zimmerman, the Yankee cycling champion, last
season won in all prizes to value of 11,848 dole.—including
85 diamond pins, rings and studs, 15 bicycles, 12 sets of
silverware, six clocks, eight watches, 11 medals, one piano,
two road buggies and a pair of horses, two bronze figures,
two cups, one dressing-case, one gun, one suit of clothes
and a set of tyres. He competed in 70 open events, and
won 66. He won eight of 14 handicaps, conceding long
starts ;of 10 international events he won eight; and he
was not beaten in any lap race. Nine out of twelve
championships fell to him, and he fell in two of them.
To capture these prizes Zimmerman had to compete at
32 race-meets in five different countries, and covered in
all 174 miles on the track in actual racing. A record.

Spofforth has one good yarn in his “ Retrospect
of Australian Cricket.” When the first Australian Eleven
went to England in ’7B, via America, they were caught in
a big storm off M.L. coast. Charlie Bannerman, though
a good swimmer, was very frightened. “Once let me
get on dryland," he said, “ and I’ll never leave it as long
as I live.” “Well," said Spofforth, “s’pose we are
wrecked, what will you do?” “First,” said Charlie,
“ I’ll save Alick, then Murdoch, then you.” “ And what
about the Victorians ? ” asked Spofforth. “ Them ! Let
them drown. D’you think I’m going to risk my life
for them 1 ”

Vic. Football Association this year decided to
substitute chance drawing tor the arrangement of matches
in place of the previous system, whereby all the big clubs
annexed the profitable dates and left the simll fry out in
the cold. When the “lot” was announced, it was found
that Queen’s Birthday, always good for 2000 spectitors,
was (as hitherto) the monopoly of the Essendon and South
Melb. clubs. And now the minor clubs fancy this is piling
on “ the long arm of coincidence ” with a shovel, and are
growling aooordingly.

was an Empress of China, or never dreamt she
had a birthday. The mean, pathetic Chow who

of a collection of nondescript effluvia, will gain at
least an inch in height, and the joyous and
corpulent Mongolian who runs an opium-den will
grow two inches, by connection with a lady who
can afford to blew £3,000,000 on her birthday.
Just think of it!—£3,ooo,ooo worth of big bangs
and little bangs, fizgigs and fiery jim-jams.
Why doesn’t somebody tell the Empress to pur-
chase £3,000,000 worth of Marshall’s Tonic

The London Times has arrived at the
mournful conclusion that “Australia is disposed to
solve the labour-question on principles involv-
ing the negation of the sacredness of con-
tract, thus imperilling the stability of private pro-
perty.” This meek little platitude has come all
the way from Hingland by cable, and it doesn’t
look worth the trouble spent on it. Contract has
never been sacred anywhere, and pretty nearly
every contract The Bulletin ever heard of has
been broken sooner or later. Also, private pro-
perty has never had more stability than a quick-
sand, for if the man who has it doesn’t lose it, his
son does, and then his grandson makes a precari-
ous livelihood by digging drains for the Corpora-
tion or something. If Australia can find any way
to make private property more unstable than it
always has been then it can effect a miracle.

The Man Who Ran Away.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
We all liked Bloxome, and when Hayes, who was
newcomer in the district, told a very discredit-
able yarn about him, most of us disbelieved it. It
was a fact, however ; and when Bloxome found
out that it was known he quietly left, without a
word of denial or explanation. Hayes had come
up to manage the only sheep-station in the dis-
trict for a large Sydney firm, and a dashing wife
accompanied him. A bright-eyed beauty with
thin lips, marvellously unpleasant to my mind.
The story was this. A few years before there
was a determined attack made by the blacks on a
station some distance to the south of the district I
am writing of. There were two runaway troopers
amongst the natives, and all hands on the station
were within an ace of being massacred, but, after
a hard fight, they beat the niggers. The station
belonged to Mrs. Hayes’ father. She and a
younger sister—both then unmarried—were on the
place and so were Hayes and Bloxome. The
shame of the thing was that Bloxome took the
only available horse on the place and rode away
on it, leaving the others to their fate.
To those of us who had learnt to know and like
the man this seemed incredible ; but there was no
blinding the facts, and Bloxome took his punish-
ment without demur. For my part, I put it down
to one of those unaccountable tits of panic which
are recorded as having seized, at times, upon men
of undeniable courage. Nobody could ask Bloxome
for an explanation, and he offe red none.
I did not like Hayes, nor did I like his wife, but
as they were my neighbours we kept on terms of
civility until I, too, left to go out West.
Three weary years passed and 1 came in for a
spell. The road we had traversed going out with
the cattle as a mere bush-track was now well
cleared and worn with traffic. Wayside pubs, had
sprung up as the advance-posts of civilisation, and
the mailmap with his pack-horse had given place
to the coach.
One evening I met and camped with an old
friend, and during the long night’s yarn we spoke
much of the old district.
“You will find a former neighbour of yours
keeping the pub. 30 miles from here,” he remarked.
“That swell manager, Mr. Hayes.”
“The devil!”
“ Yes. The firm he was managing for went
broke, and after many ups and downs he has
found his proper level.”
“ And his sweet wife ?”
“Oh ! she’s there, and a nice life she leads him.
The only time he can call his soul his own is when
he gets mad drunk.”
“ I think I shall pass without calling.”
“But who do you think is groom and wood-
and-water-joey ?”
“ Ask something easy.”
“ Bloxome.”
“ Never 1”
“Fact. He tried to fight that yarn down and
gave it up, I suppose, for he is now nothing but a
walking rum-cask. I can’t understand it; there
was something behin 1 that we never found out.
However, he and Hayes get maudlin drunk
together, then Hayes starts in to beat his wife and
Bloxome defends her and takes the thrashing.
Three such wrecks you never saw. You ought to
call, just for an object-lesson.”
As it turned out, I did call; one of my horses
fell lame and I found it convenient to stop at the
pub. that night.
I pass over my meeting with the people whom I
had known under such different circumstances.
Mrs. Hayes alternately smirked and railed at her
husband. Hayes tried to turn it off, and took
refuge in drink. Bloxome was sodden and stupid.
About midnight I was awakened by screams and
curses in the bar. Half-asleep, I and two
bullockies, who were there, tumbled into the
room. _ Hayes, with a revolver, was threatening
his wife, who seemed undetermined whether
to stand her ground or run. At our appearance
he raised the weapon, shrieking, “I’ve sworn to
do for you, you , and now I will I”
We all saw he meant ft and rushed forward;
but the woman would have been as dead as
Pharaoh before we could interfere, had Bloxome
not staggered in from somewhere and got the shot
himself.
I shall never forget that scene. A whiff of the
sulphurous smell which the discharge of a firearm
in a room always causes, brings it back to me at
once.
The squalid bar, the handsome she-devil, half-
frightened, half-defiant; and the ghost of Bloxome
reeling against the counter and then slipping
helplessly on to the floor.
The bullockies and I had the revolver out of
the madman’s hand in no time. Then I examined
Bloxome and we carried him in to a bed. I
managed to stop the bleeding but I knew at once
that a man in his state could never recover. X sat
with him all night, and the bullockies took turn
about with Hayes, who had the horrors—bad.
Just before daylight Bloxome recovered con-
sciousness. He was quite sensible and his
memory clear. He knew he was dying and was
glad to have a friend with him.
“I’ve squared accounts with her,”hesaid, “and
now I’ll tell you all. That woman, as you can
guess, has been my ruin. She took a fancy to me
when I was on J station, and she made no
of it to me. I was gone on her sister
Winnie, and would have none of her. There’s
some Latin saying bearing on the case, but I for-
get it now,”
.He stopped for a minute, for he was weak. I
did not try to prevent his talking, for the poor
fellow was bound to die, and I wanted him to
clear himself.
“ Of course, she guessed about Winnie and I,
but if it made her worse she never showed it.
■Then came the evening when the blacks tackled
us. Hayes had ridden up, and his horses were
tied to the fence. She (lie never mentioned her
hy any other name) suddenly came to me, crying
that Winnie had gone up the river to the old
plum-tree only a short time before —a big, shady
tree, about half-a-rnile up the river, where Winnie
and I had often met. ‘Take the horse,’she cried,
‘and, if you love her, go after her quick.’ God
help me ! I never doubted her for an instant. I
rushed_ out to the horse, and next minute was
galloping off. When I could not find her, I
thought she had heard the blacks coming and
planted. I searched and called until all the fight-
ing was over ; then I went back, to find that she
had never left the house, and—her sister knew it.
I was damned as a coward. Even Winnie would
not credit a word—the only one I said —in my
defence. After that I could do nothing. I
left, but my story haunted me, until I
gave it up and tried to drink it down.
Somehow I drifted here, and I have taken a
curious pleasure in knowing that she hates me
more and more for living here, a witness to the
degradation of her husband and herself. I saved
her life to-night, and that was the bitterest blow
of all, for I am going where she cannot vent any
more spite on me. On the whole, I think we’re
quits.”
Just then she peeped in at the door. I guessed
she had been listening and gave her such a scowl
that she drew back. Bloxome saw her and smiled
at me. He died, very calmly, just at sunrise.
Poor old fellow, I felt so glad that I had been
there to ease his heart by hearing the truth.

the list of his virtues. He spends one day de-
nouncing the Shiels Act for loosening the moral
fibre of the community by its facile divorce pro-
visions, and the next day in abusing unlucky
respondents and regretting that, in addition to
freeing the poor petitioner from the odious tie, he
is not able to “ triangle” the respondent as well.
Both series of remarks were in cases of desertion
where no adultery was proved.

‘Tales of the System.
GIRLS OF THE RIGHT SORT.
My daughter, unless you van work the ship off the
coast, she will soon strike the rooks, and we shall all
he lost."
So said tlie captain of a fine merchant vessel to
his daughter. He was right; it was their only
c anoe. The bark Anina, 709 tons, was bound
from Ouxhaven to Rio v ith a general cargo. She
had scarcely left port when the captain was
disabled by a broken leg. A mutiny followed.
Under threat of bad weather the Anina anchored
in a bight of a bay on the dangerous coast of Corn-
wall. Here the officers and all of the crew deserted.
A furious cyclonic south-west gale arose. The
anchors dragged, and the girl burned a flare on
deck. • The lifeboat responded, but was staved
against the ship’s side by a sea. _ All the boat’s
crew were lost except the coxswain, wlio gained
the dqgk. He was not a sailor, yet, with him
alone under her orders, this girl, who was a sailor,
cut both cables, set some headsail, and got out
into the open. It was touch and go, but true grit
won. Three weeks longer the girl commanded
before help came.' Yet it did come finally, and
so did the wedding of the handsome youngooxswain
and the captain’s beautiful and heroic daughter.
And yet there are some fools left who say we
must look to men chiefly for courage and intelli-
gence. Stuff and nonsense! Any woman will
scream when she sees a mouse (that’s mere nerves),
and ten minutes later she will meet disaster or
death with a quiet smile. Then, too, women
have a genius for throwing in a suggestion exactly
when it is wanted.
A man writes this way;—“l came home de-
jected,” so he goes on, “ and didn’t know what to
do ; but my daughter said ”
But wait a minute. Before we hear what his
daughter said, let’s have his story from the start,
shipshape and Bristol fashion. He says : ‘ In
December, 1890, I was suddenly taken one day
with an excruciating pain in tire pit of the stomach
and in the right side. For over twelve hours I
could neither sit nor lie down. ’I he medical man
who examined me gave me some medicine, but on
tlie second day jaundice set in, and from that time
I suffered from a similar attack about once every
three weeks. Fvery remedy was tried without
avail; nothing did tlie slightest good. The kidney
secretion was something frightful, being a mass of
matter, blood, and bile.
“ This continued five months, and I grew weaker
and thinner every day. My friends thought
nothing could save me. Many urged me to have
further advice, as at this time the secretions were
much worse, and the motions resembled white
clay. Another attack came on, and as I was
daily getting worse, I said, ‘ I will see the doctor
first, and if he can do me no good, I will seek
further medical help.’
“ Accordingly I went to see him, but he was
from home, and would not return until late at
night. I came home dejected and did not know
what to do, but my daughter said, ‘ Why don't you
try Mother Seigel's Curative Syrup? We hear it
has cured so many. If it does you no good it will
do no harm.’ ‘ Well,’ I said to her, * I will try a
bottle.’ .
“ X then began to take it, and oh ! how thankful
I afterwards was, for on the third day I could see
such a change. The secretion, instead of being
nothing but corruption, became clear, and the
motions a healthy colour. From that time I daily
gained health and strength, and in a short time I
was as well as ever in my life, and have had no
return of the disease. _ ....
“ I can, therefore, speak of this medicine in the
highest terms, for, under God’s blessing, it cured
me when nothing else had the slightest effect.^
The above communication is from a business
man of high character in the county of Brecon.
For especial reasons he desires his name to be
withheld for the present, but we freely pledge our
own reputation for the truth of his statement.
The date is February 12, 1892.
The attacks which would probably have soon
ended his life were of severe kidney and liver
congestion, growing out of profound indigestion
and dyspepsia. His system was flooded with bile
acid poisons, and he may thank Heaven for having
a daughter who made the right suggestion at a
critical moment. In courage and good sense she
is like the other noble girl who saved her father’s
ship from wreck while he lay helpless in his cabin.
Success attend them in their own life voyages,
say we.
M'Carthy's Brew: A Gulf Country Yar[?].
(FOR THE BULLETIN.)
The teams of Black McCarthy crawled ftdown
the Norman-road,
The ground was bare, the bullocks spare, and
grievous was the load,
And the brown hawks wheeled above them and
the heat-waves throbbed and glowed.
With lolling tongues and blood-shot eyes and
sinews all a-strain
McCarthy's bullocks staggered on across the
sun-cracked plain,
The waggons lumbering after and the drivers
raising Cain.
Three mournful figures sat around the camp
fire’s fitful glare
M'Kinlay Jim and “Spotty” and M‘Carthy’s
self they were—
But their spirits were so dismal that they
couldn’t raise a swear !
’Twas not the long, dry stage ahead that made
those bold hearts shrink,
The drought-cursed ground, the dying stock,
the water thick as ink,
But —the drinking craze was on them, and they
had no grog to drink !
Then with a bound up from the ground,
M‘Carthy jumped and cried :
“ ’Tis vain ! ’Tis vain ! Igo insane. These
pangs in my inside !
Some sort of grog, for love of God, invent,
concoct, provide 1”
M'Kinlay Jim straight answered him : “ Those
lotions, sauce, and things
Should surely make a brew to slake these
thirstful sufferings—
A brew that slakes, a brew that wakes and
burns and bucks and stings.”
Down came the cases from the load—they
wrenched them wide with force.
They poured and mixed and stirred a brew that
would have killed a horse—
Cayenne, pain - killer, pickles, embrocation
Worcester sauce !
0, wild and high and fierce and free the orgie
rose that night;
The songs they sang, the deeds they did, nc
poet could indite,
To see them pass that billy round —it was a
fearsome sight.
The dingo heard them and with tail between
his legs he fled !
The curlew saw them and he ceased his, wailing
for the dead !
Each frightened bullock on the plain went
straightway off his head !
Alas 1 and there are those who say that at the
dawn of day
Three perforated carriers round a smouldering
camp-fire lay :
They did not think M‘Carthy’s brew would
take them in that way !
M ‘Carthy’s teams at Normanton no more the
Gulf men see.
M‘Carthy’s bullocks roam the wilds exuberant
and free ;
M‘Carthy lies —an instance of preserved ana-
tomee !
Go. Take the moral of this song, which in
deep grief I write.
Don’t ever drink M'Carthy’s brew. Be warned
in case you might.
Gulf whisky kills at twenty yards, but this
i stuff kills at sight !

“Luliban of the Pool.”
(FOR THE BULLETIN.)
A BOY and a girl sab by the .rocky margin of a
deep mountain pool in Ponape. The gal was
weaving a basket from the leaves of a cocoanut;
as she wove she sang the “ Song of Luliban,’ and
* the boy listened intently.
“’Tis a fine song that thou singest, Niya,” said
the boy, who came from Metalanien and was a
stranger; “ and who was Luliban, and Red-Hair
the White Man ?”
“ O Guk !” said Niya wonderingly, “hast
never heard in Metalanien of Luliban, she who
dived with one husband and came up with another
—in this very pool.”
“What new lie is this thou tel lest to the boy
jgpcause he is a stranger?” said a White Man, who
lay resting in the thick grass waiting for the
basket to be finished, for the three were going
further up the mountain stream to catch crayfish.
“Lie?” said the child; “nay, ’tis no lie. Is
not this the Pool of Luliban, and do not we sing
the ‘ Song of Luliban,’ and was not Red-Hair the
White Man —he that lived in Jakoits and built
the big sailing boat for Nanakin, the father of
Nanakin, my father, the chief of Jakoits?
“True, Niya, true,” said the White Man, “I
did but jest; but tell thou the tale to Sru, so that
he may carry it homo with him to Metalanien.”
Then Niya, daughter of Nanakin, told Sru, the
boy from Metalanien, the tale of Luliban of the
Pool, and her husband the White Mart’ called
“ Red-Hair,” and her lover, the tattooed beach-
comber, called “ Harry from Yap.”
• # #
“It was in the days before the fighting-ship
went into Kiti Harbour and burnt the seven
whaleships as they lay at anchor* that Red-Hair
the White Man lived at Jakoits. He was a very
strong man, and because that he was cunning and
clever at fishing and killing the wild boar and
carpentry, his house was full of riches, for Nana-
kin’s heart was towards him always.”
“ Was it he who killed the three white men at
Roan Kiti?” asked the White Man.
“ Aye,” answered Niya, “he it was. They
came in a little ship, and because of bitter words
over the price of some tortoise-shell he and the
men of Nanakin slew them. And Red-Hair
burnt the ship and sank her. And for this was
Naitakirt’s heart bigger than ever to Red-Hair, for
but of the ship, before he burnt her, he took many
riches —knives, guns and powder, and beads and
pieyea- of silk; and half of all he gave to
Nanakin.” ;■ ■ -
“ Huhl” said Sru, the boy. He was a fine
man ! ” .
“ Now, Harry from Yap and Red-Hair hated
on -another because of Luliban, whom Nanakin
had given to Red-Hair for wife. This man; Harry,
lived at Ngatik, the island off the coast, where
the turtles breed, and whenever he came to
Jakuits he would go to Red-Hair’s house and
drink grog with him so that they would both lie
on the mats drunk together. Sometimes the
name of Luliban would come between them, and
then they would fight and try to kill each other,
but Nanakin’s men would always watch and part
them in time. And all this was because that
Lnliban bad loved Harry from Yap before she
became wife to Red-Hair. The men favoured the
husband of Luliban because of Nanakin’s friend-
ship to him, and the women liked best Harry
from Yap because of his gay songs and his dances,
which he had learnt from the people of Yap and
Rtik and Hogelu, in the far west; but most of all
for his handsome figure and his tattooed skin.
“ One day it came about that his grog was all
gone and his spirit was vexed, and Red-Hair beat
Luliban, and she planned his death from that
day. But Nanakin dissuaded her and said, ‘lb
cannot be done ; he is too great a man for me to
kill. Be wise and forget his blows.’
“Then Luliban sent a messenger to Ngatik to
Harry. He came and brought with him, many
square bottles of grog, and went in to Red-Fair’s
house and they drank and quarrelled as they,ev£r
did, but because of what lay in his mind Harry
got not drunk, for his eyes were always fixed on
the face of Luliban.
“ At last, when Red-Hair was fallen down on
the mats, Luliban whispered to Harry, and he rose
and lay down on a couch that was placed against
the cane sides of the house. When all were
asleep, Luliban stole outside and placed her face
against the side of the house and called to Harry,
who feigned to sleep. And then he and she talked
for a long time. Then the white man got up and
went to Nanakin, the chief, and talked long with
him also.
“ Said Nanakin (he chief, ‘O, White Man,
thou art full of cunning and my heart is with thee.
Yet what will it profit me if Red-Hair dies?’
“‘All that is now his shall be thine,’ said
Harry.
“ ‘And what shall I give thee?’ said Nanakin.
“ ‘Only Luliban,’ said the White Man with the
tattooed body.
» # *
“On the morrow, as the day touched the night,
the people of Jakoits danced in front of Nanakin’s
house, and Harry, with flowers in his hair and his
body oiled and stained with turmeric, danced
also. Now among those who watched him was
Luliban, and presently her husband sought her
and drove her away, saying : ‘ Get thee to my
house, little beast.' What dost thou here watch-
ing this fool dance 1’
“Harry but laughed and danced the more,
and then Red-Hair gave him foul words. When
the dance was ended, Harry went up to Red-Hair
and said, ‘Get thee home also, thou cutter of
sleeping men’s throats. lam a better man than
thee. There is nothing that thou hast done that
I cannot do.’
“ Then Nanakin, whose mouth was ready with
words put therein by Luliban, said, ‘ Nay, Harry,
thou dost but boast. Thou canst not walk under
the water in the Deep Pool with a heavy stone on
thy shoulder —as Red-Hair has done.’
“ 1 Bah 1’ said Harry. ‘ What he can do that X
can do.’ _
“Now, for a man to go in at one end of this
pool here”—and Niya nodded her head to the
waters at her feet—“ and walk along the bottom
and come out at the farther end is no great task,
and as for carrying a heavy stone that doth but
make the task easier ; but in those days there were
devils who lived in a cave that is beneath where
we now sit, and none of our people ever bathed
here, for fear they would be seized and dragged
down. But yet had Red-Hair one day put a stone
upon his shoulder and carried it under the water
from one end of the pool to another—this to show
the people that he feared no devils. But of the
cave that can be gained by diving under the wall
of rock he knew nothing—only to a few was it
known.” ,
“ ‘ Show this boaster his folly,’ said Nanakin to
Red-Hair, who was chewing his beard with wrath.
And so it was agreed upon the morrow that the
two white men should walk each with a stone upon
his shoulder, in at one end of the deep pool and
come out of the other, and Harry should prove his
boast, that in all things he was equal to Red-Hair,
* * *
“ When Red-Hair went back to his house Luli-
ban was gone, and some said she had fled to the
mountains, and he reproached Nanakin, saying:
‘Thy daughter hath fled to Ngatik to the house of
Harry. I will have her life and his for this. But
Nanakin smoothed his fade and said : ‘ Nay, not
so ; but first put this boaster to shame before the
people', and he shall die, and Luliban be found.’
“Now, Luliban was hid in another village, and
when the time drew near for the trial at the pool
she went there before the people, In her hand
she carried a sharp toki (tomahawk) and a long
piece of strong cinnet with a looped end. She
dived in and clambered out again underneath and
waited. The cave is not dark, for there are many
fissures in the top through which light comes when
the sun is high.
“'The people gathered round, and laughed and
talked as the two white men stripped naked, save
for narrow girdles of leaves round their loins.
The skin of Red-Hair was as white as sand that
lies always in the sun ; that of Harry was brown,
and covered from his neck to his feet with strange
tattooing, more beautiful than that of the men of
Ponape. . , , , • ~ •
“ They looked at each other with blood in their
eyes, and the long*, yellow teeth of Red-Hair
ground together, but no words passed between
them till Red-Hair, poising a great stone on his
shoulder, called out to Harry : ‘ Follow me, O,
boastful stealer of my wife, and drown thy blue
carcass. ’
“ Then he walked in, and Harry, also with a
heavy stone, followed him. Ere one could count
a score those that watched could not see Harry,
because of the depth of the vyater and the darkness
of his skin. But the white skin of Rod-Hair
gleamed like the belly of a shark when it turneth
—then it disappeared.
“ When they were half-way through a stone tell
through a fissure of the cave, and Luliban, who
watched for the signal, dived outwards with the
line of cinnet, and came behind Red-Hair and put
the noose over his left foot, and Harry, who
followed close, cast the stone lie carried away and
raised his hand and stabbed him iu the belly as he
turned, and then with Luliban and he dragging
tight the line of cinnet they shot up from beneath
the water into the cave and pulled Red-Hair after
them.
• • #
“ The people had gathered at the farther end of
the pool to see the two men come up ; and when
they came not they wondered, and someone said :
‘ The devils have seized them 1 ’
“ Then Nanakin, who alone remained on the top
of the rocks, called out, 1 Alas for the white men 1
I can see bubbles, and the water is bloody,’ and he
beat his head on the rocks and made great grief
and called out to the devils in the cave, ‘ Spate me
my white men, O devils of the cave, spare me my
good white men. But if one must die let it be
him that hath offended.’ . ,
“ Ah ! he was a cunning man, was Nanakin, the
father of Nanakin my father.
1 “ The men and the women and children ran up
again from the end of the pool ; for, although
they were greatly afraid, they durst nob leave
their chief by himself to beat out his head upon
the stones. So they clustered round him and
wailed also with him. And Nanakm raised his
voice again and again and called out to the devils
of the pool to spare him one white man ; ana the
people called out with him. Yet none of them
dared look upon the water of the pool; only
Nanakin turned his eyes that way. ,
“At last the chief said, ‘Ho, what is that.
and he pointed to the water, and they saw bubbles
again rise up and break the surface of the water.
‘ Now shall I know if my white men are dead.
“ And, as they looked, behold there shot up
from the water a yellow gourd, and the men
shouted, some in wonder and jnore in fear. And
Nanakin leaned over the edge Of the rock and
stretched out his hand and drew the gourd to him.
Then he took it in his hand, and lo ! there was
tied to the neck a piece of plaited cinnet, which
ran deep down into the water under the rock.
“ Again Nanakin called out to his men who
stood crouched up behind hi in. ‘What shall i
do with this, shall I pull it up?
“ And then—so the people said—there came a
voice from the bowels of the earth, which said,
< Pull r
“ So they drew in the line, and as they drew it
became heavy, and then something came up with
a splash, and those that held the line looked over
and lo ! there was the head of lied-Hair, wet and
bloody, tied to the end of it by the ear,
“ The head was laid upon the rock, and then
the people would have turned and fled, but that
Nanakin and two of his priests said there was now
no fear as the cave devils were angry alone with
Red-Hair, who had twice braved them.
Then the two priests and Nanakin leant over
the wall of rocks and called out again for the life
of Harry to be spared, and as they called, behold
he shut out from underneath and held out his
hands; and they pulled him in.
“‘Let us away from here quickly, was all he
said. ‘I thank thee, O chief, for thy prayers;
else had the devils of the pool taken off my head
as they have 'taken off that of Red-Hair,
devoured my body as they have devoured his.
“Then the people picked him up, for he was
weak, and everyone that was there left the pool in
fear and trembling, except Nanakin and the two
priests, who laughed inwardly.
“ When all was quiet, Luliban, too, came up
from under the water and dried her body, and
oiled and scented her hair from a flask that she
had hidden in the bushes, and went back to Red-
Hair’s house, and, with downcast face but a merry
heart, asked her women to plead with her husband
not to beat her for running away. Then they told
her of the doings at the pool. r * ,
“ When ten days were gone by for mourning,
Luliban became wife to ‘ Harry from Yap,’ and
he took her with him to Ngatik, and the favour
of Nanakin that was once Red-Hair’s became his,
and he prospered. And for long, long years no
one knew how it was that Red-Hair lost his head
till Luliban told it.”
* * •
“ Huh /” said Sru, the boy, admiringly. “He
was a Fine Man, that Red-Hair; but the white man
with the tattooed skin was a Belter.”

AMBITION.
I am the maid of the lustrous eyes
Of great fruition,
Whom the sons of men that are over-wise
Have called Ambition,
And the World’s Success is the only goal
I have within me—
The meanest man with the smallest soul
May woo and win me.
For the lust of power and the pride of place
To all I proffer.
Wilt thou take thy part in the crowded race
For what I offer?
The choice is thine and the world is wide,
Thy path is lonely—
r*may not lead, and I may not guide,
I urge thee only.
I am just a spur and a whip that smites
To fierce endeavour—
In the and the sleepless nights
I urge thee ever.
Thou shalt wake from sleep with a startled cry,
In fright upleaping,
At a rival’s step as it passes by
Whilst thou art sleeping.
Honour and truth shall be overthrown
In fierce desire,
Thou shalt use thy friend as a stepping-stone
To mount the higher.
When the curtain falls on the sordid strife
That seemed so splendid,
Thou shalt look with grief on the wasted life
That thou hast ended.
Thou hast sold thyself for a guerdon small—
In fitful flashes
There has been reward—but the end of all
Is dust and ashes.
For the night has come, and it brings to naught
Thy projects cherished,
And thine epitaph shall in brass be wrought—
“He lived and—perished !”
Abt.
I wait for thee at the outer gate,
My love, mine only,
Wherefore tarriest thou so late
While I am lonely ?
Thou shalt seek my side with a footstep swift—
In thee implanted
Is the love of Art—and the greatest gift
That God hath granted.
And the world’s concerns with its rights and wrongs
Shall seem but small things—
Poet, or painter, or singer of songs,
Thine Art is all things.
Por the wine of life is a woman’s love
To keep beside thee,
But the love of Art is a thing above—•
A star to guide thee.
As the years go by, with thy love of Art
All undiminished,
Ihou shalt end thy days with a quiet heart—
Thy work is finished.
feo the painter fashions a picture strong
That fadeth never—•
And the poet singeth a wondrous song
That lives for ever.
THE BANJO.
“The Second Mrs. Tanqueray.”
Editor Bulletin, -“The only moral of the
play, smd an orthodox woman the other
evening, is the old adage ‘That men should
never have anything to do in the way of
matrimony with that kind of woman.’” Now
is it not in this light that “The Second Mrs.
lanqueray appeals to most of the audience
(which, throughout the Sydney run, averaged
three-fourths women)? The effect on the audience
was varied: At the “awkward’’ scenes the
younger women cried, the elder women looked
dignified, the dress-circle maidens studied the
ceiling—and the men yawned. On the whole, the
audience did not like it, and the majority missed
the moral (that is if the author’s intention is to
show the unjustness of our moral code as applied
to men and women) and accepted the old,
threadbare one: “that social sin carries
its own punishment’’—in the case of a woman.
A masculine belief is that all the women who see
it imagine themselves the heroine. Not so ! had
it had that effect the play would have been much
nearer fulfilling its purpose. Had Paula been
portrayed as a victim of some great misfortune—a
nobler woman, forced by circumstances to lead
such a life, every woman who saw it would have
imagined herself a Paula ! But the “ man’s life”
railed at by Aubrey is represented as being also
the woman s chosen life. Paula is pourtrayed as a
frivolous, affectionate woman, who has transferred
herself from one lover to another, and, judging
from her remarks, has led a not altogether unen-
joyable life. Nor is her desire to be married a
good one, and that she would have been happier
with Aubrey without the marriage is highly
probable. She says: “I dearly wanted to be
married, but what is the use of being a married
woman among other married women ? ” The
‘ respectability ” attained by having a legal right
to the name of the man she lived with only stood
conspicuously forth when in the midst of women
who only bore ‘ courtesy ” marriage titles.
Paula’s resolution to tell Aubrey of her “ house-
keeping ” with Ardale (sacrificing her own chance
of happiness to save Elleari from a marriage with
a. shallow affectioned boy) is quite unexpected and
inconsistent with her character; for throughout,
though her intentions are good, her actions—with
this one exception—are petty; and to the audience
there does not appear sufficient reason for the
tragedy of the concluding acts—a widely-expressed
opinion being : “ Oh! what an awful fool she was
not to hold her tongue about knowing Ardale in
.London. And a sub-moral is regarded as being
UP rv j * 7 lsdom . of keeping one’s counsel.
Did Aubrey object to Ardale as a son-in-law on
account of his “ wildness,’’ or only because of his
intimacy witli Paula? The probability is that he
otherwise would have regarded it as being part of
a “ man’s life.”
Again, is not the idea—conveyed by Ellean’s
words: “It is in your face !” that the immoral
—or, as chastity is but one item of the moral
code, unchaste—woman carries a stamp upon her
face, and can be recognised by every virtuous
woman, a false one? Years of debauchery in
either sex will leave indelible traces, but that
women are “ hall-marked ” by an unchaste action,
is a barbarous superstition.
This play is indeed a bold attempt to pourtray
the cruelty and injustice of our sexual code with
respect to the chastity of men and women—a code
which so ridicules chastity in a man that he is
ashamed to admit it, and in which even a sus-
pected unchaste action by a woman is sufficient to
shut against her the door of respectability. How
many of the audience realise that Aubrey, whose
life, presumably, since the death of his first wife
has been quite as unchaste as Paula’s pre-married
life, should also be a social outcast?
The play is regarded as “horrid” because, for
the three hours that it lasts, the “ moral” question
is handled with an amount of freedom quite un-
known to a large section of the audience. But
how our ideas are widening ! Paula, though not
favourably regarded, is pitied; and the pure
“saint El lean,” instead of being admired, arouses
almost a feeling of repulsion for the conventional
cruelty of her treatment of Paula. May we hope
that this play proclaims the dawn of a new era,
in which justice, not prudery, will rule, and
women’s—and men’s—inhumanity to the “ moral”
female sinner be relegated to the lumber-room of
obsolete tortures ?

A critic on Zola “ Animal life can be
healthy to contemplate, but not when it exists
under artificial conditions. The wild boar in his
freedom is a sweeter sight than the domestic hog
which wallows in the sties of civilisation. Better
live with the angels wo do not see than with the
feminine failures which are actually visible. Zola
is now a pessimist, and evidently regrets his mis-
spent energies and talents. His future is behind

By enforcing the minimum regulation age

State schools, the N.S.W. education authorities
have played directly into the hands of their enemy

quite alive to this fact. Apropos , a suburban

for a name-list of all R.C. children on the rolls.
Names and addresses were supplied, and the fol-

faith remained at the State-school. Since then
however, nearly all the quondam pupils have re-
turned ; which goes to show that depression still
stalks the land—the church-schools charging fid.
against the State-schools’ 3d. weekly fee.
