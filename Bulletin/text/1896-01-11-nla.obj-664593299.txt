Speaking of “The Man from Snowy River,”
The Melbourne Argos says:—“There is hope for the
Australian Poet when a volume of verse goes into its
third edition within six weeks of its first publication, and
great encouragement is to be extracted from the fact
that the success of the book is entirely justified by the
quality of its contents.”
Mr. J. Brunton Stephens says:—“The more frequently
they are re-read the better they seem to be. I cannot
agree with the critics who say that they arc the best
bush ballads since Gordon. I think they are quite on a
level with Gordon’s, though, of course, each of the two
writers has his own special merits. . . . The best
book published in Australia for very many years.”

The N.S.W. Govt. Printer issues the third
volume of that province’s “historical
records.” Alex. Britton’s preface to \ol 1.
> reprinted, and F. M. Bladen, who edits
the volume, supplies notes, introduction, and
index. His work cannot he judged without
independent survey of his materials : it
appears to be well done. The introduction,
which summarises the contents, is clear and
succinct. The book is well bound and
printed; though figures might be substituted
for the defacing signs employed as guides to
footnotes.
* * * *
The N.S.W. Govt, is now issuing concur-
rently its historical records and a history based
on the records. The history, as a State task,
- smacks of the superfluous. If the State lays
the foundation it may well be left to learned
enterprise to erect the superstructure.
* * * *
The new volume deals with the period of
Gov. Hunter (1796-’99). Not till 1800 do
the local records begin to be of value : the
papers dealing with the province s infancy,
which might be expected to be preserved in
Sydney, have apparently been 'carefully
destroyed by interested parties. those
“first families”! Probably, when Wm.
Sikes, iun., became a man of importance in
the new colonv, the possessor of many hogs
and goats and convicts, he saw no necessity
for the publication of scandalous details
regarding his lamented progenitor. And so,
one conjectures, the Sikes Union for the
Suppression of State Papers was formed.
Held each son a lighted brand
In a bold, determined hand—
and—puff'.—the awkward little lot of docu-
ments collected by Govs. Philip and Hunter,
and Lieut.-Govs. Grose aud Paterson, made
a momentary black cloud on the Austral zenith.
* * *
Unluckily there still remained the docu-
ments and copies of documents at the anti-
podes—the letters to and from Governors,
the accounts of exploration and comments on
the colony and its people—collected m offices
at London. These are the materials from
which Mr. Bladen has made his volume-
doubtless with discretion. No editor c<wi
afford to tell all he knows.
* * * *
The N.S.W. records have interest, They
are alive, and talk. You see in them liow
strong Etruria grew by degrees up to the
level of Premier Reid and payment of mem-
bers. When Gov. Hunter took charge the
population of the settlements at and near
Sydney was less than 5000. How they lived
you may read in Robinson. Crusoe. The
Govt, fed most of them ; and even the Govt,
had frequently to take heed what it ate, and
drank, and wherewithal it should be clothed.
With such a land and such a climate the
colony could not easily reach, the stiaits
through which the young American colonies
passed. But it got as close to them as it
could.
* * * *
When Gov. Hunter got settled he fixed
prices and wages and hours of labor by
Govt, ordinance, after the paternal fashion
of those days. Here are some of the prices
which he “ conceived to be fair and equitable
between the farmer and the laborer 100
years ago :

Gov. Hunter is described by a comem-
porary as * i a pleasant, sensible old man.
It grieved him that his people should be so
remiss in their religious duties. For “ here,
wrote a missionary whose style might have
liodel for the Rev. Meekin’s, “ we have
itend -with the depravity and corrup-
of the human heart, heightened and
ned in all its vicious habits by long and
ed indulgencies of inbred corruption,
ne following the bent of his own cor-
nind, and countenancing his neighbor
e pursuit of sensual gratifications,
iniquity abounds, and those outward
sins which, in Europe, could render a
i contemptible in the public eye and
ious to the civil law, are become
nable and familiar. Adultery, fornica-
fcheft, drunkenness, extortion, violence,
incleanness of every kind, the natural
mitants of Deism and infidelity, which
boldly thrown off the mask, and stalk
gh the colony in the open face of the
so that it is no uncommon thing to hear
•son say, ‘ When I was a Christian, 1
jht so-and-so.’ ”
* * * *
rerefore, on 27tli Aug., 1798, Gov. Hun-
sued a General Order stating that ‘ ‘ with
i concern and displeasure ” lie had
served a more than usual inattention to
Sabbath Day and to the sacred duties
h that day has been set apart for the
irmance of.” So he directed that all
convicts were to go to church at least
a day ; and asked the military officers
send their servants and support the
ral themselves. Pubs, were open on
lay 100 years ago ; and if his order was
beyed he threatened to shut them all up.
to church the convicts went for a month,
u Gov. Hunter issued another General
3r —parole “Sacrilegious;” countersign,
icendiary ” —breathing fury and £3O re-
1. They had burnt his church down.
* * » *
oor Gov. Hunter ! A little before he
been involved in a dispute with Capt.
Arthur, who felt slighted because the
ernor had pooh-poohed his “plausible
i for the propagation of swine.” A
idred years ago the man whose “ plausible
l for the propagation of swine ” was pooli-
hed would stick at nothing. Capt.
Arthur complained to the authorities in
ldon. Gov. Hunter replied. This is the
, paragraph of his reply :
shall only add, further, my Lord, in this
je, that the sacred character of our Saviour,
e he to appear in this colony in its present
;e, wou’d not be secure from the dark attack of
se whose private views \_e.g., in connection with
propagation of swine] he might oppose m
or of the public interest. There are people
e who wou’d most readily prepair for His
red head another crown of thorns, and erect
ither cross for His second crucifixion ; and none
m persuaded more so than the person of whom
ave complained.
e for Capt. John M‘Arthur !
* * * *
rhis “letter from a female convict to her
her,” printed in the True Briton (Lon-
n) of Nov. 10, 1798, gives a good idea of
3 condition of the colony :
[ take the first opportunity of informing you of
r safe arrival in this remote quarter of the
irld after a pretty good passage of six months,
ice my arrival I have purchased a house, for
lich I gave £2O, and the following articles,
lich are three turkies, at 15s. each ; three suck-
y pigs, at 10s. ; a pair of pigeons, at Bs. ; a yard-
g, £2; two muscovy ducks, at 10s. each ; three
iglish ducks, at ss. each; and a goat, five
lineas; six geese, at 15s. each. I have got a
rge garden to the house, and a licence. The
m is the “ Three Jolly Settlers.” .
I have met with tolerable good success m the
iblic line. I did a little trade in the passage
ire in a number of small articles, such
sugar, tea, tobacco, thread, snuff, needles,
id everything that I could get anything
r. The needles are a shilling a paper
jre, and fine thread is sixpence a skain. I
ive sold my petticoats at two guineas each, and
y long black cloak at 10 guineas, which shows
lat black silk sells well here; the edging that I
ive Is. Bd. per yard for in England 1 got ss. for
here. I have sold all the worst of my cloaths,
3 wearing-apparel brings a good price. I bought
roll of tobacco at Rio Janeiro of 541 b. weight,
•hicli cost me 205., which I was cheated out of; 1
mid have got 12s. a lb. for it here. I like-
wise bought a cwt. of sugar there, and
Iso many other articles. Rum sells for
s. 6d. per gallon there, and here, at times,
12. Any person coming from England with a
ew hundred pounds laid out at any of the ports
hat shipping touch at coming here are liable to
cake a fortune. Shoes that cost 4s. or ss. a pair
n England will bring from 10s. to 15s. here.
On our passage here we buried .only two women
tnd two children. The climate is very healthful
md likewise very fertile, as there are two crops a
mar of almost everything ; and I really believe,
vith the assistance of God, by the time 1 have
laid the forfeit, according to the laws of my
jountry. I shall acquire a little money to return
ionie with, which I have not the smallest doubt of,
ind to be a comfort to you at the latter end of your
lays. Any person that should have a mind to
come out here as a settler, by applying at the
Secretary of State’s Office, may have a free pas-
sage, and likewise two men and a farm here, which
is great encouragement. I should be very glad to
year from you the first opportunity. I live by
myself, and did not do as the rest of the women
did on the passage, which was, everyone that
could had a husband.
I shall conclude with giving my, love to my
brother and sisters, nieces and nephews, so am,
dear father, your ever dutiful, loving, and affec-
tionate daughter till dead.—S.B.

Jennings Carmichael’s Poems.
I Jennings Carmichael’s poems are issued in
legant form by Melville, Mullen and Slade,
r. F. Hogan, M.P. (Eng.), contributes a
>ompous preliminary puli' which asserts that
he author possesses the ‘ ‘ spirit, the sym-
pathetic insight, and the imaginative power
>f the true poet.” Nothing could be further
:rom the fact. Miss Carmichael s verses are
nostly pithless and bloodless, with neither
neaning nor message. They divide themselves
into two main classes —poems about children
md poems about scenery. There are two or
three in each class with a little charm : none
with any power. Of “insight” there is
hardly a gleam. The descriptive poems read
as if the author had sat down in front of her
scene, and deliberately tried to reproduce it
in rhymes. But her epithets rarely show
the scene to the reader. She has. no
“vision ” ; she is always outside her subject.
Devout enough, no doubt; but devotion
isn’t poetry. , * .
Perhaps it is Miss Carmichael’s talent for
hunting the tame moral from its lair which
made Brunton Stephens dub her ‘ ‘ the Aus-
tralian Jean Ingelow.” But the comparison
isn’t over happy. Jean Ingelow had a little
“ imaginative power ” and some capacity for
subjective thought : Jennings Carmichael
has neither. She wants even Ingelow s
knack of melody ; a line like
Grand is the leisure of the earth !
is quite beyond her. Miss Carmichael s
talent, in fact, lies in her power to put into
—>re or less monotonous rhymes the emotions
dch passing moods and objects stir in her.
snerally, the emotions are shallow, femi-
ae, and commonplace enough. When Miss
,rmichael strikes the personal note keenly,
e is effective —if your own mood is in
mpathy ; but her effect is neither powerful
ir permanent.
* * * *
Only Mr. Hogan’s ridiculous over-praise
rpels this protest. As some amends, here
Miss Carmichael’s prettiest poem :
WHEN LIGHTWOOD FLOWERS,
memory of landscapes comes to me,
The flush of springtide fills my heart again ;
he lissom budded twigs once more I see, .
A yellow largesse over hill and plain,
wealth of blossom blows upon the earth,
In the young passion of awakening hours,
ut brightest bloom in all the land has birth,
When lightwood flowers,
far-off river current curls and sweeps
Its gurgling waters in my ears once more;
watch again how each slow ripple creeps
In foamless wavelets on that river shore ;
see the grey boat moored upon the bank,
Beneath the shadow thrown from leafy bowers ;
hear the singing in the rushes dank,
When lightwood flowers.
till hang the gnarled roots o’er the placid tide,
Where I would lie in girlish, gladsome days,
hatching the sparkles o’er the river wide,
Till eyes were dazzled by the golden rays.
,till float the yellow blossoms down the stream,
Shaken from slender limbs in perfumed showers,
Jeneath whose sweetness I could dream and
dream,
When lightwood flowers !
; hear the waters swirl below the roots,
And seem to see again, with restful eyes,
The bronzy buds, and leaves, and spiral shoots,
Wedded to break the blue of cloudless slues.
Tow was I wont to listen to the sound
Of throbbing pulses and returning powers 1
The heart of Nature leaps within the ground,
When lightwood flowers !
The reedy marshes girdled by the hills,
The low-set orchard on the willowed road ;
The dreamful distances where blue mist fills
The bushy spaces of the birds’ abode.
The stretch of valley, rich with growing gram,
Dyed with the glory of the sunset hours;
The ranges haunted by a wraith of ram,
When lightwood flowers.
O ! springs of girlhood, ye were wondrous sweet \
O ! suns of girlhood, ye did shine so strong;
No springtides bring your flowers beneath my feet,
No noontides shine so brightly, nor so long.
The loveliest and best seems dead and cold,
Buried as surely as your lisping showers,
And memory only brings the days of old,
When lightwood flowers.
* * * *
This is not the work of “ a sterling acquisi-
tion to the poetesses of the Victorian era,
but of a writer of rather graceful emotional
verse ; and in that guise Miss Carmichael is
entitled to Australian welcome and esteem.
Some Recent Publications.
I George Robertson and Co. issue “ A Visit
to Blestland,” by W. H. Galier, which
carries dullness to the pitch of genius. Style
is admirably suited to matter —“Just as we
were about to set sail, Mac became possessed
of a doubt as to whether the locker
contained a certain condiment which he
very highly prized,” means ‘*When we
were ready to start, Mac. missed the mus-
tard ” —and the author never loses a chance
of using ten big words instead of two little
ones.
Says Lond. Speaker
No Australian poet has yet been quite'Satisfac-
tory, oven in a little way, and Mr. J. 13. O Mara
is not an exception. We get no new airs, no new
emotions from the newest world. They arrive at
writing very fair verse, .which in England would
crive thorn at best a tenthuate reputation, but the
passion is one caught faintly from English models;
the eyes that look on that brilliant new world are
jaded. They do not even take the best or second-
lest or third-best models. There is a pretence of
ree living, a convention of the wild and imcon-
entional in their verses which deceives no one.
'he sprinkling of the page with words un-
uniliar to English ears no more give [ we
fiould write “gives” in AustraliaJ the atmo-
phere than if the verse were written beside a
jondon lodging-house fire—which, indeed, the
reater part of it might have been. Mr. U Mara
ioes not affect the bushranger. He is .quite
imple and direct, and apparently has no ambition
o bring the South to use, or to do anything but
yrh pleasant and facile verse. His verse is
nanly and dignified, but it lacks the magical
uggestion that makes verse poetry.
50 far as Mr. O’Hara is concerned, this is
rery just criticism. For the rest, the writer
s apparently not familiar with the three men
it the top of our poets’ class, and he is cer-
lainly unfamiliar with “ The Banjo.”
The author of “Australian Gossip and
Story,” a series of articles reprinted from the
Sydney Stock and Station Journal, mora-
lises agreeably on themes sufficiently. re-
moved from the obvious to be interesting,
though he doesn’t stir far from the obvious
point of view.
The North Queensland Register Xmas
number does Charters Towers credit. Pass-
ing the printing, it is the best of Australasian
issues—bar only The Bulletin’s. Becke
and Montgomery contribute characteristic
tales; Jennings Carmichael and P. Luftig
give verses ; and the rest of the literature is
also original and Australian—not the.work of
foreign syndicate-hacks. Some of Payne and
Radford’s illustrations are very fair, if a little
stiff.

chronic. No house should be without it, as, taken
at the beginning, a dose is generally sufficient,

“Mr. W. G. Hearne,
“ Dear Sir, —Some months ago my little boy got
very ill with bronchitis. My wife heard of your
Bronchitis Cure and got a bottle of it. The first
dose eased him, and less than half the bottle com-
pletely cured him. We always keep it in the
house now. I persuaded a friend of mine to try
it ; lie did so, and it was just as successful with
his children. You are at liberty to make what
use you like of this, as I consider your Bronchitis
Cure to be a boon that cannot be too widely
known ; in fact, I cannot speak too highly of it.

you that my father has been improving ever since

all signs of bronchitis have disappeared. Yours

Dr. GIBBONS,
Who is trebly-qualified, and registered in London
and the Colonies as a Physician and a Surgeon,
received his education in the English and Scottish
universities, and completed bis studies in the lead-
ing hospitals of Europe. He has made a life-long
study of
PRIVATE, NERVOUS & SKIN DISEASES.
He has, by diligent research, investigated their
origin and course, and has discovered the quickest
and surest means of thoroughly curing them. He
has, by his unequalled success, during a period of
man y years, obtained the highest position in his
profession. The various diseases embraced in his
speciality are those which have hitherto caused
more misery and suffering than any other kind of
trouble that affects the human frame.
Young Men and Those Who
Wish to Marry
who, as the result of early follies, or excesses of
more mature age, suffer from any of the follow-
lr )f? symptoms, namely : —Frequent headaches,
giddiness, drowsiness in the daytime, irregularity
of the bowels, feeling of fullness after eating,
specks before the eyes, halos or circles round a
candle, cold hands and feet, pains in the back or
under the shoulder-blade, tenderness of the breast-
bone on pressure, yellow discharge from the
mouth on to the pillow during sleep, palpitation
of the heart, unpleasant dreams, clammy hands,
an aversion to society, a whitish or cloudy sedi-
ment in the urine after standing, fear of something
dreadful about to happen, impure blood, spots or
pimples on the back, chest, legs, or face, failing
memory, hacking cough, falling of the hair, ftc.,
&c., should consult him, for he is now enabled
quickly and effectually, to remove the cause, and
so prevent life-long misery.

after having lost all hope.

CAPE RAOUL, TASMAN’S PENINSULA.
Scar ever frowning to the Southern pole
Over a sullen ocean, thou hast seen
Splendor of God and devilry of men,
Earthquake and tempest, and the stubborn soul
Of the oppressor; now thou art a scroll
Where Time has writ the fury that has been,
And thou for solace on the clouds dost lean,
From their full utterance gathering a soft toll.
The surges at thy base for ever thunder;
The piping winds like haggard spirits wail;
And from afar the melancholy main,

What matters it to us, that in the seething,
Unheeding stream of Life our faith gets torn
Beyond redress ; that Truth is ever breathing
Death to the fondest hopes that man has born ?
What matters it to us—who dare not tarry
To cool in happy dreams the reeling brain,
Whither the mighty eventide will carry
Us —whence we came—to Nothing, back again ?
Into one eager lifetime we have pressed
Whole ages full of hate and love and thought
And work and giant deeds —carelessly casting
All peace aside, all quietness, all rest.
What wonder, that we sadly yearn for nought
But sleep eternal, silence everlasting ?

Where then shall Peace be found? Upon the
height
Of glory ? Or within the gloomy vale
Where Death sits waiting for us stark and pale
With bloodless lips and eyes that have no sight ?
Or shall we seek it mid the quiet light
Of shadowy cloisters where sad hermits wail
With stripes and fastings ? How shall these
prevail
Though they should kneel and pray the livelong
night ?
Not in this wise may ye attain the goal;
But rather on the level plains of life
Amid the daily round of toil and strife,
The stings that chasten and make strong the soul.
Quit you like men, be patient, brave and kind,
And ye shall gain thereby true peace of mind.

Adopted by DIXSON&SONS.for their
_ Highest Grade. Mild Plug Tobacco-.
YANKEE; DOODLE ,
“YANKEE DOODLE” is everywhere spoken of as the finest plug-tobaoco that has evei
appeared here, and it has won greater success during the short time it has been on the market than
anything previously. This is no idle boast, and, to prove it, any smoker can test the statement, for
there are few towns in N.S.W. where “YANKEE DOODLE” is not known and sold. Its sale
has this year increased nearly one hundred (100) per cent over that of last year. And why is this?
Simply that “YANKEE DOODLE” has struck the popular taste. In the first place, it comes, after
• years of careful study, from a combination of certain choice Virginian tobaccos, so blended and
| exquisitely flavoured, that any smoker who can stand a tobacco heavier than the pure gold-leaf is
j forced to admit that he has at last discovered something far and away better than anything he has
i been accustomed to. DIXSON & SONS have taken over half-a-century to accomplish this; and, as
their leading business lias been built up on their reputation for QUALITY, they could not afford to
make the foregoing statement if any doubt existed. DIXSON & SONS, who use more American leaf
than all the other Tobacco Factories combined, are noted for several high-class brands: —“CON-
QUEROR,” “ SIR ROGER,’’ “ CHAMPION,” and “DOLLAR;” but “YANKEE DOODLE’
ranks supreme.

SATURDAY, JANUARY 11, 18911.
A Lesson in Land-Grant Railways.
The close of the Midland Railway arbitra-
tion brings Maoriland a step nearer to the
end of a most disastrous experiment. The
Midland is the first extensive land-grant
railway scheme which has reached anything
resembling a definite conclusion in Austra-
lasia. One or two very small ones got
through in times past with a moderate
amount of success, so far as the owners were
concerned, and a very small amount of suc-
cess as regards the country ; one very large
one in Westraliais in a feeble, semi-hopeless
state, and its financial methods have created
a great moral stench in the land ; a number
of others in Queensland have, so far, luckily
failed to get afloat ; and various proposals by
irresponsible local persons to build the S.A.
Transcontinental line on the land-grant and
British syndicate principle have so far led
to nothing. But the Maoriland Midland has
at last arrived at some more or less definite
result, and any province which dreams of
building railways on the land-grant system
should think hard over that result and all
that it implies. So far as things have gone
they show that the people who go into this
kind of business are mostly wild-cat specu-
lators who don’t risk their own money on it,
and who, apparently, have no intention
beyond grabbing the land, and exploiting
the State for further concessions, and then
abandoning a shoddy line to the debenture-
holders, or leaving it to be closed up and
deserted. Or, if that was not the purpose of
the Midland Co., then its doings can only be
set down to the awful stupidity of private
enterprise in general and British private
enterprise in particular.
* * *
The Midland syndicate started under ex-
cellent auspices. It was to build and work
235 miles of railway, and the State agreed to
pay in land-grants half the cost of the work.
The grant was to be handed over in instal-
ments as the line progressed, so that the co.
could raise money on it as it went along. All
the Government lands in Canterbury, West-
land, and Nelson —over 6,000,000 acres,
valued at nearly £4,ooo,ooo—were closed
against settlement until the line was com-
pleted and the co. had selected its grants,
the only reservation being that the State
could set aside mining reserves to the extent
of not more than 750,000 acres. Otherwise,
the co. could range all over this vast area
and select the best and most saleable pro-
perties, and the land was put in at such a
low valuation that the Midland Co. sold its
grants for fully one-third more than their
nominal value. Consequently, instead of
the State paying one-half the cost of the
venture, it really paid two-thirds, and if the
syndicate had been an honest and business-
like concern, it would have ultimately found
itself in possession of a line valued at about
£2,400,000 which would have cost it only a
little over £BOO,OOO. The work was esti-
mated to yield a return —with good manage-
ment—of 2 per cent, on its cost, which
would have meant dividends at the splendid
rate of 6 per cent, on the co.’s capital. It
was hardly possible to have a better prospect
than this, and the manner in which it was
fooled away was absolutely unique.
* * * »
The Midland Co., in the first place, flatly
refused to put up the necessary capital. It
paid up £250,000 only, and wasted every
penny of it away in office expenses, directors’
fees in London, commissions, interest on
borrowed money, travelling expenses, and
miscellaneous frill and dignity. It raised
£311,000 by the sale of land received on
account of its grant, and fooled that away in
the same fashion. Its own cash thus equalled
£561,000, not one coin of which was really
spent on railway building. Then it borrowed
£825,000 in London, and of this amount a
part seems to have gone the same way as the
capital and the land-grant—at all events the
whole amount spent in actual railway works
was not quite £760,000. And apparently it
accumulated other liabilities in addition, for,
according to the statement of its own legal
representative, its total expenditure was
£1,864,000 —£760,000 for railway building
and £1,104,000 gone in ways not very clearly
explained. Even if the State had given
twice the cost of the work in land, instead
of one-half, it could not have kept afloat so
utterly fatuous a syndicate as this.
* * * *
The line, as far as it went, was therefore
constructed wholly with borrowed money.
Said money was raised by selling 5 per cent,
debentures in London at £92 10s., so that,
after making a moderate allowance for
expenses, the money cost fully 5| per cent.
As the co. had no revenue from railway
traffic until the first section was opened, and
very little thereafter, the interest on the
borrowed money had to come, in part at
least, out of more borrowings, and the
interest on these further borrowings had to
come out of still more borrowings, so that,
if the Midland railway ever had been
completed, and it had finished on the same
lines as it commenced, it would have had to
earn about 6 per cent, on a capital cost that
was nearly twice as large as it should have
been, in order to meet its liabilities. In
other words, putting its value per mile on
the same basis as the State railways’, it would
have required to earn something approaching
12 per cent., whereas the State lines earn
barely 2f, if it was to keep out of bank-
ruptcy. This position was so utterly hope-
less that it is difficult to suppose that the
Midland Co. ever seriously intended finish-
ing and working the line. Whether it existed
principally to find billets for the directors,
or to grab the land-grant, or whether its
hope lay in bailing up the State for further
assistance, or whether it proposed to abandon
the line at last to the miserable debenture-
holders, or whether it had any definite pur-
pose or any definite idea where it was going,
is all a mystery.
* * * »
Then the Midland Railway Co. became an
insatiable mendicant sitting on the doorstep
of the Government offices and asking for
“ more.” It demanded an extension of time,
and got it. It demanded permission to alter
the route agreed upon at the Lake Brunner
section, and got that. It demanded permis-
sion to substitute an incline for a tunnel at
Arthur’s Pass, whereby it would save
£500,000 at a woeful cost in efficiency—and
it got that also. And, having got all these
things, it further demanded that it should be
allowed to abandon altogether the least-pro-
mising section of the undertaking ; that its
land should be exempted from the land-tax ;
and that the State should guarantee 3| per
cent, interest on the cost of the line. This
final demand was the last straw. The State
could have borrowed money at 3| per cent,
and done the work for itself at one-half
the outlay. In that case it would have
owned the railway ; its liability would have
been much smaller than that which the
co. asked it to undertake ; and when the
Midland line became a profitable spec,
some time in the future the profit
would have gone to the public Treasury.
The astounding British syndicate demanded
that the State should stand the loss, while
there was a loss, and that the co. should get
all the profit, when there was a profit.
Naturally enough, the Maoriland Govern-
ment refused to entertain this unspeakably
impudent suggestion, and soon after the
Midland Co. ceased work. A little later it
stopped payment of interest on its deben-
tures and became a hopeless ruin. Then its
contract time expired, and, as it had only
completed a little more than a quarter—the
easiest quarter —of the undertaking, and
there was no earthly prospect of further pro-
gress, the Seddon Government formally can-
celled the agreement and took over the un-
finished line as provided for in the contract.
It was driven to this course by the fact that,
until the work was completed or the contract
ended in some other way, all the State lands
in Canterbury, Westland, and Nelson had
to remain shut against settlement at an
enormous loss to the Treasury and the
community.
♦ * * *
The next stage of the long, dismal agony
of Maoriland’s land-grant syndicate swindle
was the arbitration, in which the Midland
Co. kept up its reputation to the end as the
most shameless joint-stock job that ever
came out of Bull-land. It demanded
£1,817,000 damages and various other items,
which, with the land-grant already received,
would have made something near £2,500,000
as the price of 75 miles of not-very-well-con-
structed railroad and seven miles of partially-
finished ditto. It claimed these amounts for
reasons which were as remarkable as the rest
of its proceedings : (1) The concessions
granted to it had been “unreasonably de-
layed.” The said concessions were granted
solely as a favor and with no shadow of right
whatever, and the Midland Co, demanded
heavy damages because the favor hadn’t been
granted more quickly than it was. (2) The
State has reserved certain mining lands. It
retained the right to reserve 750,000 acres,
and of this area it actually reserved only
about 150,000 acres, therefore it treated the
co. five times as well as the letter of the
agreement demanded, and the co. wanted
damages because it wasn’t treated still better.
(3) The State refused to allow the co. to
annex the timber on these reserved lands, to
which timber the Midland syndicate had no
claim whatever according to its contract.
(4) The State had imposed a land-tax which,
when the co. selected its lands and sold them,
would be payable by the buyers in common
with all other land-holders in Maoriland, and
thus it had, or might have, “depreciated”
the value of these lands. As the land which
was handed over to the co. at £1 an acre
realised on an average £1 75., it got much
more than it bargained for, despite the de-
preciation, yet it wanted damages in addition.
And (5) it wanted more damages—great
quantities of them—for the seizure of its
line, despite a cast-iron agreement in writing
that the line was liable to seizure if the work
was not carried out according to the terms of
the specification. There was a long, weary,
and expensive arbitration on all these points,
and finally the umpire, Mr. Blake, an Irish-
Canadian lawyer and politician, gave his ver-
dict against the co. on point.
* * * *
The situation of the Maoriland Govern-
ment in the matter is'now an interesting one.
It has got 82 miles of railroad in three dis-
connected scraps, and to make them of any
serious value it must complete the great line
itself. As the object of the whole business
was to avoid making the line itself, this is a
serious matter. The co.’s agreement has
blocked settlement in Canterbury, Westland
and Nelson for 10 years, and has lost the
Treasury 10 years’ land-revenue over
6,000,000 acres of country ; and, in conse-
quence of this reservation, there is still
practically no population along the route,
and hardly any traffic. The B„ate has paid
nearly £400,000 in land-grants for its 82
miles of line —only 75 of which are really in
working-order—or £5OOO per mile, which is
very little, if any, less than the amount for
which it could have been built and owned the
road at present rates. Even in the old, extra-
vagant days of high wages and bad manage-
ment, and lavish expenditure for land-resump-
tions, Maoriland railways only cost £7700 per
mile, and with low wages, cheap material,
economy, and practically no land-resump-
tions to be paid for, the Midland line, so far
as it is built, should have cost no more than
the State’s present outlay. In addition to
this, these three scraps of road purport to
be mortgaged for £825,000 to the British
debenture-holders, and the position of the
Government with regard to their claims is a
difficult problem. If the claims hold good,
then the line will represent a national outlay
of £15,000 per mile. And, as a further
trouble, the seizure by the State is only a
partial and ineffective measure. All the
Government is authorised to do is to run the
bit of line as the company’s trustee ; if it
more than pays expenses the co. gets the
surplus;, if it doesn’t pay expenses the loss
can’t be recovered from' the co., which is
utterly lost and insolvent. To acquire actual
possession it will probably have to pay for
the work in cash after already paying in land,
and before any ( definite result is arrived at
there will almost certainly be more costly
litigation. Probably the debenture-holders
will foreclose on the co.’s interest in its little
scrap of iron rail, and then the State, and
the co., and the debenture-holders, and the
miscellaneous creditors, will tight a quad-
rangular duel and ultimately arrive at some
kind of a settlement. Meanwhile, the co.,
being in England, has the capacious ear of
the British public, and its mendacious howl
goes out through the length and breadth of

the Midland railway scheme is about the

imagined
The Transvaal —and Some Reflections.
The attack on the Transvaal by I)r. Jameson,
the butcher of the Matabele, has come to an
ignominious ending. Doubtless the glorified
Rhodes arranged the plot, and Jameson was
merely his catspaw. If Jameson had br.mgiit
the chestnuts safely out of the tire, the monkey
would have taken the credit ; as it is, only
Jameson’s fingers are burnt. Probably, when
the invader marched over the frontier, he
reckoned upon reaching Johannesburg before
he could be intercepted ; and lie made sure of
Johannesburg assistance. Johannesburg—to its
credit —kept quiet; and the Boers were too
alert for Jameson, and entrenched themselves
right in his path. It does not appear that they
at any time took the offensive ; and Jameson
had no choice but to retire or to make a bold
stroke for success. The bold stroke, in this
instance, was mere madness. Probably not
twice their number of the best troops in the
world could shift, without artillery, 1500
Boers from a strong position in their own
territory. Jameson apparently tried to
do it with 700 or 1000 men—man for man
probably unequal to the Boers in guerrilla
warfare. There co.uld only be one result.
Jameson was forced to surrender, with a
loss of 240 killed and wounded ; Rhodes has
cast him off'; and lie is to stand his trial by
court-martial.
# * * *
The game was obviously to embroil England
so far that the Boers would be “settled” finally.
It was reckoned that once British blood was
spilt, once the British flag had been fired on,
Britain would have to suppoit the invasion
whether she liked it or not. Reliance was
placed on the real grievances of the “foreigners
at Johannesburg, on the warlike temper of the
Tories, on the still smarting sore of Majuba
Hill, on the influence of the Chartered Com-
pany and the Duke of Fife, and on the
glamor of the Rhodesian policy of “ all
South Africa a British province.” Had the
Johannesburgers risen, and had they and
Jameson won one battle, or even held their
ground, Britain would hardly have missed the
opportunity of at least converting her nominal
suzerainty of the Transvaal into an effective pro-
tectorate. The inaction of Johannesburg spoilt
the scheme. Jameson became merely an un-
authorised freebooter bearing arms into friendly
territory. The cutting of the wires—equivalent
to the burning of his ships—in order to prevent
his recall, made things worse. And, to crown
all, he failed to sustain himself. Not having
half-armed savages to deal with, he was
ingloriously beaten ; the climax of Laing’s Nek
was capped ; and once more the British flag
was trampled on by filthy Boer feet. The
episode is one to make any well-constituted
Tory gnash his teeth.
* * * *
But Jameson’s crime for whatever the
Boers have done they have done nothing to
justify attack by the mercenary troops of a
greedy British syndicate—has had consequences
infinitely more important than its local results.
It has stimulated a hardly-paralleled outburst
of indignation on the Continent against Britain
and her methods. For it cannot be denied
that, after all, Jameson was but carrying out
on a small scale what Britain has consistently
performed on a large. The bombardment of
Alexandria had not a whit more justifica-
tion than the invasion of the Transvaal :
and the policy now' sought to be applied
to the Boers is but the policy by which
Britain has won half her empire from
weaker nations or savage tribes. This time,
however, its brutality was too obvious. Ger
many has been stimulated to a most significant
protest; Holland is enraged; France is de-
lighted at the British reverse ; and there is not
a doubt that the sympathy of other European
nations is with the Boers—or, rather, against
the British. Stupid John Bull suddenly
awakes to find himself the most unpopular
person in Europe, and is indignant that his
motives and actions should be so misconstrued.
More, he begins to be a little alarmed. France
and Russia he knows are hostile to him ; but
if there is any nation to which he has a
right to look for support it is Germany,
with which he is connected by blood, by royal
alliances, and by g,n apparent concord o
European interests. That Germany should
turn against him gives even stupid John Bull
pause.
* * * *
It is high time that Britain seriously con
sidered her position, and began to set her house
in order for war. Her navy is her sole hope ;
she has not, like the Continental nations, her
manhood enrolled in her defence ; and were war
to break out suddenly, all her millions could
not buy her trained soldiers. It takes time to
make a soldier. You can do it in five years,
perhaps in three; but the foe at Britain's
gates will not wait even three years.
And now that it is certain that every
European power w'ould gladly see her humbled,
even if they would not gladly take a hand to
humble her, it behoves British statesmen to
face seriously the situation which has been
fronting them for the last score of years.
Quite apart from Australians’ direct interest in
the encounter, we must have some indirect
anxiety for Britain’s future. We hate British
cant and greed and hypocrisy, but we admire
British blood and grit and force. We have
nothing to gain, and a good deal to lose, by the
relegation of Britain to the. ranks of second-
rate powers —a contingency which looms ever
nearer. With all Britain’s faults, we cannot
wish her failure in the struggle before her—if
she has anything like a just claim to struggle for.
* * * *
In the Transvaal matter, Britain is clearly in
the wrong ; and, as this fact seems to be
thoroughly recognised, the squabble will
probably go no farther. But it is interesting
to ask how exactly would Australia stand were
war declared to-morrow and this country
embroiled in it by reason of the existing
British connection. How many men, cap-
able of bearing arms, have we to face a pos-
sible foe, and how many trained men ? How
many stand of rifles are available, and how
much ammunition? What artillery, uniforms,
accoutrements have we ? The Bulletin sus-
pects that truthful answers to these questions
would be by no means reassuring. Some day—
and perchance soou—the ponderous articles of
our newspapers and the ceaseless gabble of our
politicians will be cramped into one word—
Fight! We eat, and drink, and make merry,
and chatter, and scribble conceitedly enough :
suppose the grim utterance came—“ Thou fool,
this night shall thy soul be required of thee ! ”
—what then ?

Federation Critics.
Arthur Rae, an ex-member of the N.S.W.
Parliamentary Labor-party, writes at' great
ength to Sydney Daily Telegraph pointing
out obstacles in the way of Australian Federa-
tion Owing to the obvious and beautiful fact
that construction is difficult and destruction
vety simple, and that it is many hundred times
easier to show what shouldn’t than what should
be done, critics of this description are always
plentiful. | Also, the person who shows what
shouldu t be done always looks more powerful
and more eloquent than the other man, for the
same reason that a conflagration looks more
picturesque than the spectacle of a peaceful,
ordinary person laying bricks. One of Mr.
Rae s complaints is that the Federal second
chamber is likely to be called a “senate,”
whereas it would be more appropriate to call it
a “ States-council. ” This is a matter of com-
paratively small importance; so long as the
second chamber is well-constructed and does its
work to good purpose, The Bulletin, for one,
doesn t care much even if it is called a port-
manteau or a horse-box. Mr. Rae also com-
plains that there is nothing said so far about
any arrangement for secession, and that the
federation seems likely to make Freetrade
impossible—in other words, that most Aus-
tralians are Protectionists and there is no pro-
vision for putting a foreign-trade minority on
top But most of all he objects as follows :
While urging this contention, I submit, at the same
time, that it is extremely unfair for a constitution to be
drawn up by delegates, of whom some will be elected on
the plural-voting principle in force in Victoria, Queensland,
Tasmania, and Western Australia; those from this colony
on the basis of “ one man one vote,” and the South Aus-
tralian delegates on the single votes of both men and
women. Surely we must expect the return of more Con-
servative delegates from those provinces with a restricted
property franchise, than those elected by the more demo-
cratic colonies I have mentioned.
There is no remedy suggested for this obvious
difficulty—unless it be the remedy of waiting
till the more backward provinces catch up.
ihe same difficulty has been pointed out many
hundred times already, and no remedy ever
appeared—except waiting. And if New South
Wales holds back until Queensland and Victoria
and A estralia have got manhood suffrage, and
then B.A. and Maoriland insist on further
waiting till New South Wales and the rest
have womanhood suffrage as well, when the
end of the long interval comes things will be
no further advanced. By that time one or
more of the more advanced provinces will have
made further improvements in its system of
untdTluTot? aud aga ‘, U ifc will have to wait
until the others overtake it. Unless each nrn

ibis proves, of course, the interests of the Fat
and the Lean Man to be so closely allied that
str ( r/ he , f r er Was fcaxed > country
started downhill on the road to beggary.
Every year the amount of income to he
axed grew less, and the amount of revenue
derived from the tax became smaller, and if the
impost continues the bottom will presently fail
out of everything in S.A., as the natural result
of Democratic legislation. And yet the alleged
figures which prove this desperate state of
are all mere bluff—unless, indeed, the
o. A. Government returns, which are the final
court of appeal on the question, are wholly
false and unreliable. According to that large
and apparently serious publication, the income-
n X m , lgBb yielded onl y =£--,500, aud the
alleged £07,000 is apparently made up by
adding two years together and representing
them as one. The receipts for 1892 didn’t
show a paltry rise from <£57,378 to £57,825, as
the result of 50 per cent, more tax, for neither
of these figures existed; they showed a rise
compared with 1886, from £22,500 to ,£48,700.’
In 1893, a further increase in the tax raised the
revenue to <£60,000, not £73,000 as alleged.
And ni 1394, according to the same apparently
reliable public document, the returns didn’t fall
to <£<>B,ooo but further increased to £270,000.
instead of the alleged falling off, which is ’held
up as solid evidence of poverty aud increasing
destitution, the proceeds of the income-tax
steadily increased each year from ’B7 to ’94
therefore the natural inference is that it didn’t
blight the community as alleged, or undermine
the national prosperity, or do anything except
show that the Fat Man could bear taxation
better than anyone else in the country, and
that to tax him was a wise and wholly com-
mendable proceeding. Where the Ass organ
got its figures doesn’t appear, hut, judging from
the nature of them, they certainly look as if
they were manufactured by the apprentice Fat
Man on the premises.
Du i Punishment.
“Here, as in England,” snorts Melb. Argus,
a feeling seems to be growing against the due
punishment of vile creatures who, from time to
time, perpetrate horrible crimes.” Which out-
break of scorn, by the way, was suggested by
the agitation for the release of George Dean
at a time when his horrible crime and personal
vileness were quite unproved. But no matter.
The point of the foregoing Tory remark seems
to lie in the application of that little word
due. Xo wrong-thinking Radical objects to
the punishment of horrible criminals, as far as
iiiE Bulletin knows. The gallows is objected
to on the ground that a compulsory corpse,
swinging from a Government noose, is
not a first-class moral reformer, nor a
valuable influence upon murderous-minded
people. Wrong-thinking citizens hold this
opinion. ihe Argus and other organs of
correct thought are in a position to state that
hanging is a due punishment whenever the law
calls for it. Xot so very long ago sheep-
stealers and forgers and “ disloyal” stump
orators who spoke ill of the monarohial insti-
tution were duly killed, but a “feeling grew ”
against these legal proceedings until Kiev dn!\
ceased. The word “ due,” it will be found on
reflection, is an ancient Tory excuse for brutal
opptession and general bad conduct on
the part of the powers that be. Wrong
thinkers have been slowly changing the due
into the undue for centuries past, nevertheless
existing evils have their worshippers by virtue
or the lamentable law which keeps them alive.
Respectability still points a fat finger at the
figure falling through the prison drop with its
head in a white hair, and says, “ Due punish-
ment ! Respectability said the same thing, in
the same tone of voice, when James Barrett
aged 16 years, the first “man” to be put to
death in Australia, was hanged by the Botany
ay Government for stealing provisions from
the state store-house.
Tiie viciously-inspired Criminal Law of New
South Wales in such cases as that of T. M.
Sheridan sins with equal malignity against the
accused the jury, and the Executive. It
classes the accused, who knows that he did not
mean to take life, with wilful murderers: it
constrains the jury, who believe that he did
not mean to kill, to return a verdict to the
effect that he wilfully killed, and it constrains
ie Executive, except under rare compulsion
from irregular sources, to inflict the highest
punishment for an offence which members of
the Council individually admit is not murder
in the first degree. This triple-headed iniquity
is the direct consequence of employing the
woul malice in Criminal Law in a sense
which it does not possess in morals. Every
wrongful act done intentionally without just or
lawful excuse is supposed, in Criminal Law, to
ie done maliciously, so that men like Sheridan,
who take life by misadventure, are, because
they intended a wrongful act at the time,
legaHy held to have taken that life with malice,
in morals the essence of murder lies in the deli-
berate taking of life to gain private ends or with
malice against the person. This definition
stands true to every mind, legal and otherwise,
it presented in the abstract; yet all concerned
in the trial of any such case under the existing
Criminal Code adopt the legal definition of
malice, thereby obfuscating their own intelli-
gence, perplexing and bewildering the general
public and often punishing with death persons
not morally guilty of the offences ascribed to
them. N. S. W. Parliament is promised a debate
on Capital Punishment next session, and
whether or not the death penalty be abolished
it is to be hoped that the word “malice” as
defined in Criminal Law will receive the atten-
tion of the House.
Judge Windeyer having obtained six months’
leave, the public concludes that he is making
ready to retire. The public’s wish is father to
its conclusion. The Bulletin, being in no
way dominated or influenced by the subtle and
powerful forces which for so long have einbas-
tioned a man whose continuance on the Bench
of Justice was, after the hideous Mount Rennie
trial, a public calamity and disgrace, gladly
lays a wreath of carrots on the official coffin of
his Honor. lor full vindication of the course
which it lias pursued in relation to Mr. Justice
Windeyer, whom it has only known and criti-
cised in Ins public capacity, it confidently
appeals to the verdict of history—to the undis-
puted and indisputable facts of the most shame-
,l o° •• , 1 tr * t * lat * las ta ken place under
the British flag during the last hundred years,
lor the rest, it wishes Mr. Windeyer health
and prosperity, and devoutly trusts that Aus-
tralia will never again see on the bench a man
so utterly unfitted by Nature to preside over
criminal trials.
“ Serious conflict/eared ” was the legend on
the newspaper-contents hills last Thursday
when news came that the African Chartered
Co. s guerrillas were pouring into the Transvaal,
lhe national hypocrisy looms up even there.
Everybody who knew anything about the
malter hoped for that row all he was worth.
I lie Boers hoped for it, for they are suffering
from swelled head of the largest and most
greasy description. The British in the Trans-
vaal hoped for it, for the large, fat, pious Boer
is an unbearable person. The Chartered Co.
hoped for it for the sake of territory and plun-
det* and influence. Rhodes wanted it for the
sake of his South African federation. The
papers wanted it for the sake of the sensation,
lhe world m general howled for it because
a great upstanding fight is a thing that
vvarms the public soul. And, in any case,
the invasion, if it had succeeded, was a
thing with many good points about it.
Lhe Boer is about the most unprogressive
and most ignorant white man on earth.
He is brutal, dirty, intensely pious, given
to long, dull sermons and hymns, given
also to living on an earthen floor, where the
grease of ages accumulates, and his large
pious, unwashed frau is commonly reported to
sleep with all her clothes on-a mountain of
hot, bulgy flesh heaped up shapelessly in a
r, UI , 1,16 world’s great objection to the
Englishman is Ins arrogance and snuffle, hut, in
the present case, he was opposed to the only
man on earth who is a more aggravated snuflier
than himself, and a good deal of sympathy went
with him in consequence.
A curious point of law. At YVhittlesea (Vic.)
a nre broke out on some land belonging to the
Board of Works and spread to. an adjacent
farm where it did much injury to property
and badly combusted a woman who tried to
put it out. There was a person in charge of
the Board of Works land, but he only looked
on and didn t attempt to stop the spread of the
S 8;, jury, after two trials, awarded
10s. damages for the property destroyed
and the burnt woman. Then the Full Court
considered the matter, and decided that though
the person in charge knew of the fire, and
didn t attempt to put it out, no damages were
recoverable unless it was shown that he dis-
tinctly approved of the conflagration, and so
another new trial was ordered. According to
this new and brilliant reading of the
farmers wife can’t recover damages for the
injuries done through the other man’s neglect
unless it is shown that the other man reallv
enjoyed the hre and was pleased to know that
she was injured, and as it is practically ini
possible to show whether he was pleased
or not, unless he waved his hat and
o leeiet when he saw her running away with
her skirt on fire, the ease hopeless.
Ihe most astonishing feature of the law is its
capacity for breaking out in new and unex-
pected places. If the same rule had been
applied to the case of Madame De Alba, who
was awarded damages for having her’head
shattered by a lift accident in the Freehold
Investment Co s building, she obviously couldn’t
have recovered anything unless the Freehold
Co. was shown to have distinctly approved of
the lift being in such a state as to lead to the
accident, and it had been obviously pleased
and happy to know that it was in such a state.
Ohiet Justice Madden is admittedly an ex-
perienced lawyer, but experience in law seems
° 3e . a )ou k as destructive of common-sense as
experience in rum or opium. Meanwhile, if
the plaintiff wins his case, the damages won’t
cover Ins expenses, and if the Board of Works
wms it will have spent a lot more in trying to
resist payment of the £272 10s. than the money
amounts to. The civil law is probably the most
expensive swindle ever invented— and the
stupidest.

Oh, would there ? Then what becomes of the
dogma of the infallibility of the gospel of
Freetrade . Let the Daily Telegraph for ever
hold its peace concerning the recreancy of its
no, Premier Reid, in wanting to “ protect ”
ie agriculturists by “ bonusing ’* the rail-
ways. For the Great Confession is out. “It
might become essential” to have protection
in the event of war! Ergo, Freetrade is a

Ed. Bulletin,—l can endorse, as far as Thurs-
day Island is concerned, the comments on the
Japs, by your Roebourne (W. A.) correspondent.
-the Jap. women are now at Croydon, Nor-
manton Townsville, and Mackay, supplying
Australia with any quantity of disease. Twelve
months ago there were a good number of white
shipwrights employed here, earning 15s. per
day; and there were three ship - building
slips owned by white men. Now there if
only one white man’s slip, employing the owner
and one man. Two Japs, own the other two
slips, and do nearly all the work, employing
between -0 and 30 Japs, at from ss. to 7s.
pci i ay. ibis place was opened by white
men and now the colored men rule the roost—
thanks largely to the local black-labor firms.
All kinds of Jap. mechanics and merchants are
coming here and leaving for the South by
nearly every “China steamer.” Within the
last two months they have introduced women
in men s clothing for the purpose of prostitu-
tion. Ihese women are attended by a keeper
to every gang, and are practically slaves, as
the police here know.—Pearl-Shell.
To the making of cycle heroes we shall have no
end. Given a bike (on time-payment) any sort
of young man may hope to achieve a transient
tame, and the trouble, very soon, will be to put
a name to the real champion of the hour. The
pacing ” question is peculiar to bike-racing.
We don t have steam engines to encourage the
competitors in long-distance running-matches
nor a lb-oar crew to show the way in a champion
sculling-race, yet cyclists require “ triplets ” to
bring them along. Many of them seem incap-
able of travelling their hardest “ on their owin’’
lo abolish pace-making from test-races will be
to abolish champions who wouldn’t be chain
pious if somebody else had had a chance to
hang on to the triplet.” And before
any sort- of champion has reigned for
six months, he will be overtaken by dis-
turbances in his stomach and dethroned If
his vanquisher gets biliary trouble next time
they meet he will go down because he wasn’t in
his proper form,” and some unexpected high-
geared outsider will capture the blue ribbon
tlirough “ stealing a march ” on the cracks and
being singularly free from pains inside at the
time. What with the triplet or no triplet,
nigh-gear or low-gear, one sort of track or
another sort of track, “true form” or colly-
wobbles, it will be difficult to take an intelli-
gent interest in cycling, such as one takes in
other sports whose champions don’t come and
go like shadows.
The emotions are naturally stronger than the
powers of logical thought.” Thus philosophises
; Jell> °drne Argus on the agitation for the re-

the general demand for a second trial. Few

conducted that it would be impossible for the
evils of the earlier one to recur ? That was tin-
whole matter, so far as the public was con
cerned. A Royal Commission appeared to be tin-
best constitutional method of dealing with the
affair, and to that body the subject was
remitted. The issue does not prove that tin;

Imperious Fashion
Ordains that the summer season of 1895 is ended.
Social life, no less than climatological phenomena,
marks the changes of the seasons. The winter
season is Fashion’s Carnival; the summer its
period of comparative respite. The autumn and
winter seasons are the periods for indoor merry-
makings, festivities and functions, all of which
necessitate much more “ dressing ” (speaking
technically) than the out-of-door recreations of the
hot months. Howbeit, each change of season
brings its monster “clearing sales.” Surplus
stocks must be quitted to make room for the new
importations. This is the occasion of the startling
bargains now obtainable at Manning and Co.’s,
Collins-street, Melbourne. The cream of this
fashionable firm’s stock of Millinery, Costumes,
Fancy Dresses, Silks, &c., &c., is now being posi-
tively sacrificed to make room for new goods.

Sydney,
January 7, 1896.
My Dear Moorabtnda—
“ John-a-Dreams ” drew a good house to Sydney
Lyceum last Saturday, and the most gaped-at
woman in front was Mrs. Brough in a black gown
cut square with jet round what dressmakers call
the “decolletage,” and gauze sleeves; a diamond
star at her neck. Lively Emma Temple accom-
panied her and wore black, too, with a cluster of
crimson flowers on the port side. It’s an odd
thing that an actress always spends her night off
at the theatre —j ust as a waiter al ways goes to haunt
a friend still flying round with the chops, when he
has a holiday. In “John-a-Dreams ” sartorial
honors are even between Mrs. Wanklyn (Hilda
Spong, who returns in all her pristine slimness
and doesn’t steer herself along with her elbows so
jerkily as of yore) and Kate Cloud, Miss Beryl
Faber. By the way, Kate’s regeneration from
her dowdy past is one of the coinpletest phoenix-
ings ever seen on any stage, and makes it seem
almost impossible that so much deep-seated purity
and old-established virtue could ever have done
those things they didn’t oughter have done. Miss
Faber can’t help her air of superhuman goodness,
but it makes her confession in a virginal white
gown sound like baseless hysteria. Why doesn’t
she sew a black hem round her spotless skirts to
help the public imagination a little?
In the first act Kate (under a) Cloud wears
yellow brocade with big sleeves and a soft drapery
of lace about the bodice, which is brightened at the
neck with spring green and has glittering sequin
trimmings ; in the second, she wears white, while
Miss Spong sports an ideal cycling costume (it is a
shooting-suit in her case) of brown heather tweed
with short skirts and tan boots, a well-fitting coat
and vest, and a Tam-o’-Shanter with an edge of
peacock-blue. In the third act, Hilda wears a
very pretty silver-grey. skirt, with a violet blouse
covered in grey chiffon, small grey bonnet trimmed
•with pansies. Miss Faber also wears a grey skirt
with a black satin brocade blouse. It is in this
act, when the two men are fighting over her, that
Kate suggestively remarks, “ I II wander down to
the church.” As both men wait to marry her,
this sounds like a pretty broad hint for one of
them.
Cecil "Ward, as the bold, bad baronet, is the
first villain I have ever seen smoke a pipe.
Hitherto on the stage a pipe meant high moral
rectitude, and the villain always fused a cigarette.
Also, Cecil’s villain does most of his diabolical
plotting in a sac suit and a hard-boiled round hat
—he is indeed a novelty. Titheradge doesn’t
exactly look like an opium-eater, nor does he very
much resemble his ancestor on the wall ; John-
a-Dreams is not his best part by long chalks. The
new scheme of lighting at Sydney Lyceum seems
certainly kinder to the complexions of the stage
ladies, for the stage-light is more refined and
dimmer than usual, and if the new semi-illumina-
tion catches on actresses can go back to printed
calico for brocade, and glazed lining for French
silks, as in the good old days, and nobody except
the first row in the stalls will be any the wiser. I
thought the dim after-dinner light on the yacht in
the first act was excellent—indeed, the only draw-
back to the intense realism that prevailed aboard
the Moonbeam was the energetic sailor in the
fourth act, who hung on to the wheel like grim
death although the anchor wasn’t shipped.
On dit that Williamson and Musgrove will not
renew their lease of Sydney Lyceum, which ex-
pires with the year, but will do as other companies
do —simply pop in a” 1 out of whatever playhouse
suits ’em—rumor h... ug it that their first love,
the good old Royal, which in the past carried
more fleas to the square inch than most theatres,
will be their principal scene of action. Of late
the gorgeous Lyceum has been lite,rally eating its
head off. The B. and B. Co. gave up the long-
lease system years ago.
The annual dance held last Friday by the Moss
Vale Lawn Tennis Club in the local “ new hall ”
new to the extent of smelling new—was a cheerful
affair. The decorations were done very neatly by
the committee, which also took the supper in hand
with tlie very best results. The floor was even,
and as Mons. Kowalski, who was present, highly
approved of the dance-music played by the P.A.
/ pnd, there was no flaw in the mounting. Gov.
Hampden was too tired, or bored, or something,
to turn up, and the silver lining of his absence was
that it saved the committee all the wear and tear
of erecting a dais ; and so many glittering mili-
taires —with short red mess jackets and long,
arrowy legs with a tinsel stripe all the way down—
were spotted about the room that an unadorned
Fersonage like H.E. was not missed spectacularly.
t is very amusing to see the way some horse
soldiers walk a ballroom —under protest, as it
were, and apparently in splints, and it appears
to be correct f or them to hold their hands as if the
last four buttons on their weskits were missing
and they wanted airily to conceal the discrepancy.
But there is one bad habit not common to Captain
Gingah, and that is sliding his hands into his
pockets. Mars holds himself up by his sword-hilt
if he feels he musi be supported, though a side-
long glance at his epaulettes is a wonderful
reviver.
The dresses were on all fours with the rest of
the show. Mrs. Scrcggie (wife of one of the hon.
secs.) wore creamy gauze over silk, and moonshine-
colored fixings on tie bodice; Miss Richardson
(feminine hon. sec.) wi sin sunset pink with butter-
fly sleeves and a charming necklace of pink roses ;
Miss Bessie Tarrant (who shortly goeth ’Ome to
be married), wore pale eau-de-nil satin with pink
sleeves; a medico’s wife presented a blushing
appearance in pink brocade ; a wealthy widow
fittingly wore yellow, the exact tint of Australian
gold ; and a plump milit;. ry matron in black with
big yellow sleeves evidernly didn’t put much faith
in the pocket Ezekiel’s dismal foreboding, “Woe
to the women who sew pillows to all armholes ! ”
The ever-fashionable Bong-Bong, or Bong-Tong,
races are billed to eventuate on the 16th and 17th
instants at the picnic race-course. The race-ball
happens on 17th, and with the Governor to be
there as large as life, will, as usual, be the most
important society fixture of the recuperating
season.
From W. H. Paling and Co. I have received
Aug. W. Juncker’s latest song, “Star of the
East,” words by Russell Rogers, and dedicated to
“my friend, Mr. Phillip Newbury.” “Star of
the East ” is not labelled sacred, but it is so full
of “glory to God ” that the person who loves to
make Sunday hideous with song cannot do better
than buy “Star of the East” at once. It is a
good, chest-expanding melody of the “ Jerusalem ”
stamp, and makes up into a most effective warble.
From the French Musical Instrument Depot
comes Mons. Kowalski’s charming melody, “Twi-
light of Love,” words by Gilbert Parker. “ Twi-
light of Love ” is the mezzo-soprano song that
made such a good effect at the production of
Kowalski’s oratorio, “Future Life,” on Xmas
eve. It is published with both ’cello and violin
obligati. From Gordon and Gotch comes a very
lively-looking “Australian music portfolio” (by
the way, one hardly sees where the “Australian ”
comes in) with a mob of gaudy masqueraders on
the cover and a good lot of things inside : “The
Diver,” “ To Anthea,” “Quand tu chantes,” “ O,
Rest in the Lord,” with the plaintive “Valerie
Waltz ” and the “ Palotta March” to hold up the
instrumental end of the log. It is really a mar-
vellous shillingsworth.
Medical men are really the least impressionable
of mortals, therefore I am not a bit surprised to
hear that a well-known Sydney medico has taken
the rooms lately the scene of the most sensational
double suicide ever known in Sydney. Neither he
nor his wife shrinks from occupying an apartment
fraught with such gloomy memories. After all,
the experience they once had in China was worse
—when they rented an alleged haunted house, in
which the gore of a murdered Parsee still lent a
rich tone to the floor of the front parlor. But
they merely threw rugs over this engaging sou-
venir of the former tenant, and forgot all about it.
“Pat,” at Sydney Royal, is a rorty sort of
utterly irresponsible whirligig, which principally
deserves praise because it keeps cutting off short
at the meter the dreadful Irish hero with no
braces on, and substituting a gay and gladsome
ballet for his shamrock-scented maundering*.
How nice it would be if everybody followed suit,
and, when the heroine came on with her hair
down, shoo’d her off in favor of a pas de quatre !
Minna Phillips sings sweetly, and looks very en-
gaging as a phenomenal colleen with golden hair.
Most stage-colleens look as if they stood on end in
a pot of blacking, but Ould Oireland evidently
knows how to turn out a blonde now and then.
Florrie Forde, as a Gaiety Girl, wasn’t quite so
screamingly dressed as Maud Hobson, but her
mauve chiffony frock only wanted a few more
yards in the skirt; and her blue silk with a black
lace flounce and things embroidered in gold was
festive. In the Gaiety, girls are dressed with that
wonderful playing into one another’s hands so
common behind the footlights, where you never
see Tottie in green trying to “kill ’ Flossie in
blue—not among the chorus, at least. Miss
Beaney Gellatly’s high-kicking is a beautiful
thing of its kind, and if the “ Statute Nymph ”
rather suggests that “Beaney’’has two or three
artificial legs concealed among her overwhelming
black and red skirts, it is a graceful show for all
that. Harrie Ireland looms large and rather heavy
as a Society widow, and Mr. Westmacott, one of
the best-dressed men on the local stage, also turns
out to be a comic vocalist of the deepest dye.
“ Pat ” is brightly and effectively staged.
An English duchess has lately been giving out
her views on those amateur attempts at nuns,
Anglican deaconesses, u horn I always look ujion
as so many possible bigamists, since they wear the
ring which marries ’em to the Deity (so the cant
goes), and yet take no vows of earthly celibacy,
but are liable to go off at any moment with their
most moneyed admirer. The Duchess got home
with her left on the subject of foreign missions
in the course of her remarks: “ Women could
always be found to act as missionaries to the
heathen . . . yet for more prosaic . . .
duties of work among our own poor sufficient
volunteers were not forthcoming, especially from
the Church of England.” And when the Anglican
sisters do consent to stop at home and do a little
slumming, they put in most of the time in decid-
ing what length their veils ought to be, or whether
it wouldn’t be a good ad. to wear a crown of
thorns round their bonnets in the Autumn ! The
only way out of the difficulty would be to make it
one of the rules of the game that no nation shall
christianise itself. Thus if we send missionaries
to jolly Japan, Yum Yum will have to come here
with a portable Joss-house and return the compli-
ment.
W hich reminds me that a pretty choristeress in
a leading Australian church has been getting a
good ad. in religious circles by expressing her firm
detenniuation to go to China and drag Ah Sin
into the narrow path of Christianity by his little
pigtail. She was one of the prettiest girls in the
choir, too; so first the parson tackled her and
pointed out in a solemn voice that her first duty
was to her aged mother, or some poetic relative of
the sort, and that it was plainly her thorny path
to remain like a rose at the head of the band.
After that, the wardens got on her trail and
pointed out how the yellow heathen is a lot more
religious than you’d think, much more so than
her own back alley ; and after the war-
dens, the organist and the curate took a hand
in dissuading her. Consequently, the whole
church hung breathlessly on her decision (she
really was a pretty girl), and when at length she
said that she wouldn t go to China —well, then
the parson’s wife got red in the face and openly
remarked that she was a designing little cat.
A Sydney surveyor had an amusing experience
the other day. He and his assistants were
measuring a rather dubious street with the pretty,
bright silver tape common to the process, when a
lady stepped up to the best-looking assistant and
said, “Fardonme, but what do you pay a yard
for that?” The surveyor named the high price
necessary, and the lady appeared discomfited.
“ Uh, so dear as that? I only wanted some to
make a bustle! ” and with a radiant smile she
passed on. Now isn’t that a woman all over ?
Everything subservient to dress. She only looks
upon the stars as so many effective buttons run-
ning to waste. Like a girl I saw, the other day,
looking at a mountain waterfall blown by the
wind. After a breathless period of gazing out
came the truly feminine remark : “ What a lovely
bridal-veil that would make ! ”
Lord Hampden’s speech at the Hielan’ Gather-
ing on New Year’s Day, ye ken, left much to be
deprecated from a fashionable standpoint—l refer
to that part where he alluded to not being proud
of his ancestors who got hanged for poaching.
Remarks of that kind are quite uncalled for in
Australia, where everybody’s grandfather didn’t
die in his bed either. Gov. H. could have won
local renown by saying that the ecstacy he derived
from contemplating that hanged ancestor must
ever remain among the proudest emotions of his
life (wild cheers from Potts Point).
My Melb. correspondent writes :
“Roland Cunningham is for the moment a
‘ ladies’ idol ’in the .London world. One gushful
society paper speaks of him as the handsomest
tenor on tlie English stage. Melb. folk who have
seen ‘ Roley ’ lately say he certainly has improved
vastly. Always good-looking, he has now lost tlie
namby-pamby giriy expression which characterised
him when in Melb., and his voice has gained much
in strength and power.
“ A recently-imported Age man sets the fashions
in the Melb. press world. He wears ties har-
monising with the rest of his attire, pink limp
shirts and sensitive pants which turn up sympa-
thetically at the hems when it rains in London.
Apart from this beauteous youth, Age men are
proverbially shabby—as were Akgus men until
lately, when, fired by the noble example of the
aforementioned youth, almost the whole staff
blossomed out into top-hats, ‘ street-sweepers’and
patent-leather boots.
“ A dozen years ago a Melb. merchant died
leaving his widow penniless. Having some skill
(or rather experience) as a palmist and futurist,
she set up in a suburban main street. Last year
she had amassed enough by half-crown fortune-
telling to trip to England and the Continent. She
returned after a year’s absence, and continues to
thrive at her ‘ profession. ’
“ A crematorium is to be erected in St. Kilda
cemetery. As the cemetery is situated in the
midst of a thickly-populated suburb, the fumes on
“ cooking ” days will be obnoxious to the residents,
who are already petitioning the authorities.
Opposite the cemetery is a mansion prophetically
called ‘ Closeburn.’
“A brilliant and fascinating poster of Meunier’s
decorates Melb. hoardings.' The subject is the
New Woman —an audacious little minx with long,
narrow, Trilby feet, and a ravishing mouth, who
glances wickedly at passers-by out of half-closed,
heavily-lidded eyes.
“The Brasseys are the most desperately ener-
getic governors Victoria has yet had. They rise
with the sun and speed round St. Kilda beach on
their bicycles—they rush back to breakfast, then
off again to committee meetings, opening of things,
morning calls —anything, just to put in a good
day’s work. They are essentially of the fnend-
and-acquaintance-making order. You hear of
them at breakfast in one big Toorakian house,
at lunch in another, or dropping in promiscuously
to afternoon tea. They can tbe accused, either, of
putting on airs. If their own carriage isn’t ready
—well, the other day, H.E. was seen wildly rush-
ing out of his own gates, racket in hand, to catch
a passing tram. This delights the ordinary tram-
riding 1 populace. It may be a big bid for popu-
larity, but it’s a very homely and harmless one.
The Brasseys take local society as they find it.
The Mars-Buckley lot have captured them just as
completely as they captured Lord Hopetoun ; but
so have some other people as well, at whom
even Lady Loch, the first to begin this sort of
promiscuousness, drew the line. The danger the
Brasseys run is that of having no standard at all.
“Since Bradfield and his songs have left it is
the fashion in Melb. society for conversation to be
as extremely risky as possible. A story is about
concerning a dashing widow whose accomplish-
ments in the way of Equivoque and double-entente
have taken full advantage of this license. A
newly-imported johnny had met her at a garden-
party, and after an afternoon with her and others
of her set came away marvelling at ‘ Colonial
Society.’ ‘I thought you’d draw —haw—the line
somewheah,’ he remarked in a general way to a
‘ fwend ’ who had no clue to the johnny’s mistake.
The next afternoon johnny drove to the fair
widow’s villa and was further astounded at the
style and surroundings. Then, primed with the
fizz he had taken, he awaited her. Presently she
entered—and no one knows exactly what occurred,
except that shortly after a crushed and bewildered
and very sobered Englishman was tottering down
the path to his cab. Since'then the widow’s con-
versation has been pruned and prismed except
where she is safe among intimates.
“ In ‘ Djin Djin ’—the record show up to date at
Melb. Princess’s—Mr. Barnes’s dresses are among
the chief attractions for the women. It is safe to
prophesy that Flo. Young’s magpie dress, or her
brown and crimson get-up as Prince Eucalyptus,
will be seen on more than one young person with
shapely limbs, at the next winter fancy-dress ball.
Flo. Young looks her best as a boy. Some,
though, are simply wild over Flora Graupner’s
hand-painted wedding-dress—ivory satin, with
blue and purple irises; being tiny sne looks appro-
priately like a Japanese doll.
“ Speaking on the subject of example at a
Melb. Y.M.C.A. function last winter, Rev. Dr.
Rentoul took occasion to remark that * whenever
wan fule rides a bighsighele along St. Keelda-road
on a Sawbath there are 10 more fules ready to
follow heem.’ Gov. Brassey and suite may be
now seen every Sunday pedalling along the
thoioughfare in question, and Toorak prepares to
follow—yea, even to a thousandfold. So Dr.
Rentoul has scored. Still, some further remarks
on the subject from the ultra-loyal Rentoul
would be interesting. ”

“ John-a-Dreams,” put up at Sydney
Lyceum on Saturday, is a play which is hard to
locate. It looks a rather good drama when splen-
didly staged and played by an excellent co. ; if it
were staged a little worse and played by an inferior
co. it would probably fall so suddenly that its skull
would crack loudly on the pavement and a crowd
of seedy men would gather round to see the corpse.
There is distinctly less in it than in “Captain
Swift” or the “Idler.” Two young men—a
dreamer who takes opium and gazes into the sea,
and a moderately bad young baronet —have made
a vague, unstamped agreement to be always loyal
to each other. They call this “ the Oxford com-
pact,” and drink to the health of it considerably.
Then they both fall in love with a girl who has a
“ Past ” of the usual monotonous kind ; if that
girl had been gaoled for stealing, or had committed
murder or burglary in her childhood’s hours, it
would at least be more original. The girl rejects
the baronet, and the dreamer sits up all night and
indites a poem to her on two sheets of paper—
which is a very long grind for a very small poem.
Also, he tells his old clerical father about the
opium, and, when he is still staggering under the
revelation, the girl tells him about her Past.
After that there is more maundering over the
Oxford compact, and the baronet drugs the poetic
dreamer in an impossible fashion and tries to carry
off the girl in a yacht, but, being retarded by bad
weather, he is overtaken and nothing very definite
happens, except that it is generally understood
the dreamer and the girl will get mar wed shortly
with the consent and blessing of the old, shocked
clerical parent.
* * * «
The dialogue of “ John-a-Dreams ” is nof
especially brilliant, and the humor is somewhat
scarce, and though the drama is neatly con
structed there is none too much meat upon it. A
lot of the things that might be expected don’t
really happen. The girl’s Past doesn’t rise up
against her. The opium-dreamer doesn’t see hor
rible visions of crocodiles and worms. His poen:
leads to nothing. A certain estranged couple whe
are supposed to be funny have apparently quar
relied about nothing in particular, and they
get partially reconciled for no very definite
reason. Titheradge and Boucicault show to
moderate advantage in two characters which
are not large enough to hold them. Miss Fabei
plays the girl with the Past prettily and success-
fully, and the two strongest characters are Cecil
Ward as the bad baronet and Granville Blake
who makes a big, muscular success as Hilda
Spong’s “Johnny” husband and the man who
dismisses Hilda’s lover in a shattered condition.
A very unusual and beautiful scene on board a
yacht, with the big mainsail shaking in the breeze,
and the cool green moonlit ocean in the back-
ground, does as much as anything else to help
“ John-a-Dreams ” along to its unspecified desti-
nation.

All riders know what a delight it is to enjoy a
smoke as they go pedalling along, but during the
hot weather a pipe is too heavy and a cigarette
too enervating. Most cyclists are now smoking
ouly Frossard’s Cavour Cigars,“which, from their
delicious fragrance and freedom from nicotine,
make them the ideal wheelman’s weed. Although
the nicotine is extracted from Frossard’s Cavour
Cigars “in vacuo,” they retain all the qualities
desired in a first-class cigar. The finest riders of
the day indulge in nothing else, amongst them
Pouvet, the French champion, who swears by
them and recommends them to all riders. We dc
likewise, and in wishing you many a pleasant spin
during this new year, we hope that you will take
our advice and smoke only Frossard’s Cavour
Cigars. Mild and fragrant. Obtainable every-
where in packets of 8 for ls, #
of ice in it, and the spectacle of a hot black nigger
being walloped by his infuriated owner was not
appropriate. In any case, “ Uncle Torn ”is a
play which has seen its best days, and Little Eva’s
entry into paradise isn’t taken seriously now, and
when the heavens open after Tom’s decease and
show the long flight of steps at Lavender Bay
jetty all polished with Pears’ soap and lined with
angels, the public naturally expects to see Geo.
Lean steering the ferry-boat into the picture. The
Pollard version of the drama, however, is pro-
bably intended to be taken in a light and airy
spirit. There is much small nigger, and dog, and
comic song, and breakdown and Virginia reel in
it; and Marks, the comic lawyer with the aged
umbrella, pervades it all through ; and, as the
small nigger and the dog and Marks take up so
much space, Little Eva has to sicken and gradually
fade away and die of slow consumption all in 10
minutes, and almost all the beautiful remarks
she makes on her death-bed are crowded out.
Ihe conversion of Topsy is also cut out, and
Uncle Tom is hurriedly walloped at 10.30 and
dies almost instantaneously. This airy way of
treating the business makes the lugubrious drama
almost cheerful, and doesn’t harrow up the audi-
ence in the old, dreadful fashion.
* • * •
One illogical feature in almost all versions
of “ Uncle Tom ” is the extreme old age of the
hero. As a rule, he starts in the first act as a bald
and rheumatic nigger with a white patch of wool
above his ear—a nigger so obviously only fit to be
boiled-do n tli it the large prices paid for him are
ridiculous. By the time he comes into Legree’s
possession he is a doddering cripple, without a leg
to stand upon. Despite all discrepancies, however,
the co. played the piece throughout remarkably
well, the youthful Quealy, as Marks, being especi-
ally noticeable as a clever comedian. And by the
time this appears in print the juveniles will have
wisely gone back into comic opera, which is their
strong point. To-night (Thursday) “ Cloches de
Corneville ” will be produced (n.v.), and if D.
continues to V., “ Girofle-Girofla ” will follow on
Friday, and “Pirates of Penzance” on Saturday,
with “ Madame Fa vert ” and “ Ermime ” in
reserve.

Her Majesty’s pantomime continues a
highly profitable spec., and it has brightened up
considerably of late. It goes faster than it did,
and Friday and Saturday have got a strong hold
on the audience, and the public is gradually being
educated up to Marie Luella’s legs, which can
only be fully appreciated by a cultivated taste.
The suicidal person who cast himself out of the
gallery is nearly recovered now, though, with the
usual inverted cussedness of things, the two
people he fell upon are both far from well. He
was a good advt. for the pantomime, however,
and he might easily have thrown himself over in a
worse cause.
“Pat’’goes on his misguided Irish way
at Sydney Royal, and his painful resemblance to
every other Irish drama still continues. He is as
purposeless and as incoherent as he was at the
beginning, and the reason of his existence remains
a mystery which will not be solved until the ocean
gives up its dead and their ghosts drip solemnly in
long rows on the sad sea-shorp.

Mr. George Bull, of the Australian Star,
a well-known and much-esteemed Sydney press-
man, who is departing shortly for the foggy land
of his brother John, is to have a m itinee benefit
at Her Majesty’s (Sydney) on Friday of this
week. The Criterion, Royal, Tivoli, and Her
Majesty s companies all take part in the pro-
gramme, and Premier Reid, General Hutton, and
other mighty persons lend their patronage and
moral support to the proceedings.
* * #
The two music halls have done nothing
very special this week. Lawler s establishment in
George-street is still cheered by the presence of
the mirthful Benham. The Tivoli announces
the last nights of Alice Leamar, whose absence
will create a serious void, unless she can be re-
engaged with great difficulty at enormous expense,
and induced to shed the light of her countenance
on the scene a little longer.
The joyous magnificence of W. and M.’s
panto, at Melb. Princess’s is just now employed in
making itself talked about. The first audiences,
expecting nothing remarkable, were so dazed by
“ Djin-Djin ” that they went home with only half
an idea of the total effect. Then their uncles,
cousins and aunts came along, prepared to see
something unusual, and therefore better able to
appreciate the spectacle at all points. The Firm’s
latest effort invites criticism, and will fatten on it.
Artists Gordon and Goatcher painted the scenery
bet ween them, John Wallace arranged the order
of things, and manager Williamson drew up the
‘ < k* 1 campaign. Also, Bert Royle devised the
book, ’and Leon Caron made the musical stew.
As for Coleman’s valuable legs, they grew upon
him several years ago.
** * *
Santa Claus,” in conjunction with “ The
House that Jack Built" and a ramshackle giant
ot loose principles, is flourishing at the Royal,
banta Claus ” has not yet earned The Bulletin’s
earty blessing, but it shows a disposition to
reform, and Miss Florence Wilton protects it
from strong language in the meantime. The new
ady is vivacious, and her tight-fitting rationals
are evidently the handiwork of the same master
builder who made for Billee Barlow. Moreover,
she kills the Giant ere that wobbling monstrosity
exceeds the limits of endurance. A burlesque
comedian, able to run in double harness with the
intelligent Miss W. —as Leslie used to
ally himself with Barren—might do much for this
antique pantomime show. Miss Maud Williamson,
who took somebody else’s place as a prince after
the first few nights, makes a striking vision in
her airy summer garments, and adds a touch of im-
portance to the co. Also, the Fire Ballet (new to
Melb.fc is a toothsome suggestion of roast fairy,
not too underdone.
*** * .
Dan Barry’s dramatic company holds'forth
at Melb. Alexandra. Jlist now the bill
or iare is “ Foiled,” and the hero is sentenced to be
sawn asunder by Augustus Glover, an actor whose
hne broad style of wickedness and large rolling
eyes and voice qualify him for the job. Augustus
has several intended victims in the melodrama
under notice, but luck is against him and lie dies
without one deliberate murder to his credit. At
the end of the first act he surprises an Australian
into dropping dead of heart-disease, otherwise his
career ranks as a failure. Miss Lora Mostyn foils
him all the while. Dora is a black tracker with a
prejudice against Augustus because he cut her
tongue out in days of yore, arid every time he
goes to commit a capital offence the dumb
heathen follows his footmarks across country and
blights his scheme. “Foiled ” would be a better
melodrama if Augustus were allowed to attain his
end occasionally. The story has a well-defined
commencement and some strength of character
until it degenerates into a frantic grab at new
horrors. The circular-saw sensation and the in-
cident of hurling a female off a three-foot cliff do
more harm than good to Foiled.” The manage-
ment should furnish Mr. A. Glover with a meat-
axe, and allow him to do a little plain and fancy
mutilation in place of the absurdly complicated
atrocities which come so utterly to grief. Some
stirring acting by Glover, J. P. O'Neill, and Miss
Duggan is slunk into the evening’s entertainment.
The only Rickards has promised to re-
appear at the Opera House on Saturday (11th)
with a new lot of songs acquired during his recent
travels in far lands. On the same evening Miss
Alice Leamar, late of Sydney, will appear for the
first time with the Melb. co. The joint arrival of
these two favorites promises to be the cheerf idlest
thing that has happened to the Opera House for a
very long time.
Fill up your glass with brandy, rum or Scawtish
whuslty prime,
And drink long life to old Djin-Djin, an Eastern
King of Crime,
A demon dead to sense of shame, whose notes are
loud and low — .
For he’s the cove wot puts a name to Melbourne’s
biggest show.
Although he scorns to comb his hair, and jubilates
in sin,
No other demon anywhere
Can revel in the splendor rare of J apanese Djin
Djin—
Chin-Chin —
Your ’ealth and song, Djin-Djin !
Djin-Djin within his haunted den a talisman
secretes,
But Florence Young, the pink of men, his pur-
pose dark defeats,
Assisted by a Fairy Queen, who mocks the
monster’s rage;
And then the famous earthquake scene falls wallop
on the stage.
The rest is all a gilded whirl of up-to-date
delights,
A rush of tuneful chorus-girl, arrayed in gleaming
tights,
A blaze of pomp in palaces, a ballet mid the snow,
And such-and-such sweet fallacies, as well as so-
and-so,
And jokelets tame, or witty, help to make the
panto, hum,
Till the dream of bright illusion
Slowly comes to a conclusion
In the lime-lit Golden City of a fairy Kingdom
Come.
So fill your glass with nectar, do, or charge it with
champagne,
And drink long life to Djin Djin, who has not
been born in vain,
Although he scorns to comb his hair (which, by
the way, is thin)
No other demon here below
Plays name-part in a finer show than Japanese
Djin Djin—
Chin chin —
Your ’ealth and song, Djin Djin !
At Porerty Point.
,S:S.: “ Flo. Young, as the Arcadian-Austialian in the
Firm’s panto., is very fine and large, and waible's'charm-
ingly, but she is obviously diffident in tights just yet, and
it is absurd to compare her to Marie Luella in that par-
ticular, to the disadvantage ot sweet Marie, whoas always
at home and at ease in her breeches of indecorum. It
requires considerable experience to wear tights con- :
vincingly, and the actress accustomed to petticoats
usually seems to be troubled with chilled knees and ail
anxiety to pull down her vest. Miss Young lias not
learned to forget her petticoats.”
Mr. Nathan, the erstwhile Sydney solicitor, will ere:
long appear in opera in Europe. He is at present kept
rather dark, and is pledged to his master, Sbriglia, not to
sing even in private. He is reputed to have a lovely
quality of voice, though at present it somewhat lacks
strength.
Ada Crossley, writes a Bulletin correspondent, is, up'
to date, the most successful of all the Australian singers
save Melba and Frances Sax ill a. She is now making a
clear £lOOO a year. She has London engagements until
the coming autumn. A private letter tells of the A is-
tralian contralto being included in the cast of a n w
opera shortly to be produced in London although when
she left here her fixed intention was to study for oratorio
—a class of music much better suited to her voice and
style.
Charming Frances Saville has been engaged for a season
in the States at a big salary, and will sing with Jean de
Reszk6 in “ Ronffio et Juliette.”
From a lady’s paper: “ Before long- the idea will have
died out that the Creator made woman's lower limbs (the
writer, of course, means legs) so beautiful in order to
make it a sin to look at them.” The sex is marching.
Lucy Escott’s demise is wired from Paris. Escott and
Squires did not marry until near the end of their Aus-
tralian professional life, wherefore they lived happy ever
after. Squires was fraudy, a pale little fat man, with an
inevitable falsetto ; and Escott only had the rags of her
voice, even when she came, but was a splendid actress and
remarkably fine woman.
An Australian actor was in an American theatre, when
a bland stranger began to chat with him. Says our
friend : “ Excuse me, sir, I am listening to the play.”
Afterwards he found he had snubbed Longfellow.
“ It is believed that Nellie Farren may yet recover com-
pletely from the paralysis of her lower limbs, as she did
from a former attack of the same kind.” Here’s to their
speedy restoration to power and glory 1
Pro. : “Nelly Farren had an effusive reception at the
opening’of her London theatre, Opera Comique, but will
come down with a slump. She sat in her chair and re-
ceived the shouted congratulations of ‘ her boys,’ the
johnnies. How beautiful! But Johnny is a selfish little
beast, charity is cold, and he will be after the May
Yoh6s.”
“ Prof.” Kennedy had another turn at the hypnotic
sleep business in Adelaide, and this time Frederick Keat-
ing, the subject, was sent off for eight days and nights.
Kennedy says this is a record. Keating, by the way, is
the man who was put to sleep for six days by Kennedy in
Melb. Kennedy “is the only man who can awake his
subjects thus hypnotised,” and people are asking what
will happen if, in the middle of one of these experiments,
the Professor gets run over by a tramcar, or something.
Apropos Thomas Kennedy and mesmerism. The writer
knew a splendid “subject” some years ago—an amateur
actor and very impressionable. He was the best subject
ofaS.A. lecturer on mesmerism, and went everywhere
with him. Suddenly the young fellow went mad, and for
several months was on the verge of death, but eventually
he grew better, although he can never fully regain his
health. The lecturer—then and still a well-known busi-
ness man—gave up lecturing and now never refers to the
subject.
“The solicitors of the families of both Arthur Dacre
and Amy Roselle,” writes The Bulletin’s London corres-
pondent, “persist in their denial that either of the un-
fortunate mummers could have been in want of money.
What a mockery to say they • could have had what they
wanted,’ when Dacre was full of indignation, even before
leaving for Australia, at the want of sympathy, and the
refusal to help them when they had even gone so far as
to sell off all they possessed to provide for their wants ! ”
All the English papers seem agreed that Arthur Dacre
was the sole cause of the unhappy couple’s misfortunes.
Before they left, Dacre refused £3O a week engage-
ments for Amy Roselle. “Both or none,” was his
invariable answer. Only once was the wife permitted to
act alone, and she gave up after the first week, as while
she was at the theatre her husband sat moping at home in
a dreadful state of suspense and melancholy.
Dear Bulletin, —In last week’s Poverty Point there is a
suggestion that Ada Colley should have her voice sent to
Europe to be trained. Sarcasm, surely. It isn’t so much
training that Miss Colley needs, so far, but voice. Little
material to work upon, little sweetness or power, or any-
thing in Miss Colley’s singing except a clever trill and
skilful production of falsetto trick notes. Hers is one of
the lightest and least musical light soprano voices that
ever knocked an uneducated audience, but it is exceed-
ingly well-trained for its music-hall purpose.— Mark Hazy.
A London man recalls a Dacre story told by Arthur
Dacre himself. A provincial manager was notorious for
providing ill-furnished and insanitary dressing-rooms.
Dacre complained in vain. One evening the manager
}vas in a terrible state. “ Dacre,” he said, “ that
iron bar across your room fell down this evening and gave
your dresser such a blow that I had to send him to° the
hospital.” “By Jove,” said Dacre, “ I’m terribly sorry to
hear that.” “ Yes,” said the manager, “and it’s only by
God’s mercy that the bedroom jug and basin were not
dashed to atoms.”
The young man who gushed in Melb. Age over “ Djin-
Djin,” foamed all over Williamson’s shirt-front on account
of the alleged newness of the idea. It was time all the
well-worn panto, themes, such as “ Crusoe,” “ Sindbad,”
etc., were dead and buried, and so on. But a more
cautious youth, who was sent to scribble about “ Santa
Claus” at the Royal, gushed in praise of Coppin for avoid-
ing all new-fangled notions and keeping to the good old
tried lines.
Carrie Moore, the larger little girl who joins Ivy Scott
in “ I don't want to play in your yard ” (Melb. Princess’s),
is a novice on the stage- never faced the footlights before
Boxing night. A very clever performance under the
circs. Little Ivy is practically a stage veteran.
The earthquake in Melb. Princess’s panto, is derived
from an Am -ricaii drama of long ago. Manager William-
son has been saving up this spectacular effect for the last
20 years, awaiting a favorable opportunity to slip it into a
show. “ Djin-Djin ” was the opportunity, and the earth-
quake is realising J.C.W.’s fondest hopes.
Nellie Farren’s first venture in theatrical management
is said to be a failure—extensively lauded by the press,
but an obvious failure all the same. The burlesque on
“ Trilby,” produced by the bright, deserving little woman,
has no humor, satire or fun in it.
J. C. Williamson works off a fine chestnut upon an
Argus interviewer as a personal experience. He tells
how Brigham Young got at his management when he was
playing “ Struck Oil,” in Salt Lake City, by bringing Mrs.
Young in on a family-ticket, and ha'lf-filling the circle
with her.
Janet Achurch has written a short story, “ A Lucky
Man ’’—evidently inspired by what Charrington isn’t.
Mrs. Courtice Pounds, who followed hubby to this far-
off land, has been enrolled in the Firm’s opera co. Her
stage name wasn’t decid 'd on at time of writing. It may
as well be the lady’s matrimonial title, for the information
of all and sundry.
Miss Fortescue (the lady who got £lO,OOO as a solatium
for her wounded affections from the late Lord Garmoyle)
was, on the whole, a bad failure in South Africa. The
South African Review on her Juliet: “Miss Fortescue
manifests tender emotions by a sing-song whine, rage
with the rasping gutturals of a virago, and sought to
arouse recognition of the critical situation in a climax by
bellowing gibberish which was not recognisable as the
text. If costumes could have done it, Miss Fortescue
would have illustrated a reason why Juliet’s father wished
her to wed a wealthy suitor at short notice. But thsre
is more required for the part than an ability to carry
fantastic millinery with the art it demands. More than
this Miss Fortescue has not got ” The Standard
and Diggers’ News contends that most people in the For-
tescue Co. play tolerably, with the glaring exception of
the leading lady. “ Melodramatic ‘ mouthing ’ and rant-
ing and grimacing and turning up the whites of her eyes
and elocuting in an unpleasantly stilted and -wooden
fashion isn’t acting.” Interviewed by the Press, Miss
Fortescue said that Johannesburg was an odious town.
“ What / call living, is passing your time profitably with
dignity to body and mind. Can you do that in Johannes-
burg ? To lead a healthy life you require to be surrounded
by ,a certain sort of cleanliness of body and soul. In
Johannesburg you can not.” Too true. But how beauti-
ful (remarks the paper) Johannesburg would have been
had not Miss Fortescue’s performances been the most
wretched failure on record 1
The Bourke (N.S.W.) Anglican church and its ad
joining hall were burnt to the ground on Boxing Day.
The hall had turned in many an honest penny to the
preachers from quadrille parties and travelling theatricals,
and nasty people whisper that the place was struck by
the Almighty’s hand for having been used for worldly
pleasures. Some 16 swaggies helped the scanty fire
brigade in its at tempt the extinguish the flames, writes an
unregenerate Bulletin correspondent. The day was
terribly hot, but the swaggies worked with a wiil, and
saved much furniture. The men were all hard up, and
some of them hadn't even had a feed on the day when
“ peace and happiness shall reign upon earth,” But they
didn’t get a meal or a drink, or even “ thanks” for their
labor.
Only Melbourners can understand why Williamson
forbade Elton’s gag, in “ Djin Djin,” on Leonora Orelli’s
appearance. “Here is the Orelli’s sweet strain.” The
underlying reference is to the Reilly-street drain, and, of
course, Orelli was the first to scent it.
“Trilby” was bound to come. George Musgrove has
bought the Australian rights for the Firm, and is engaging
new people to fit the leading parts. The boom null be in-
augurated at Melb. Princess’s on Easter Monday, they say.
J. F. Robin, one of Rickards’ new people now appearing
at Melb. Opera House, seems to travel chiefly on his hearty
laugh, or cackle. Robin reminds one, in a small way, of
Jolly Nash, the fat man who shook his sides in Australia
for a while during the “ eighties.” Nash-he was among
the early fathers of London music ’all entertainment
lived, and lived well, by his infectious laughing songs for
thirty years, and may still be flourishing at the old
“ wholesome funny ” business. The jolly one’s cachinna-
tions were works of art in their way.
Lady Carington is one of the sponsors for the son of
Mrs. Aubrey Desborough, otherwise Mrs. Lawrence
Cautley—daughter of Mr. and Mrs. Carl Fischer, of
Sydney.
Australian singers, actors, authors, and artists seem to
be forming a clan in London. From letters coming out, it
is clear that they gather closely around a fresh arrival
from “down under.”
In Southern theatrical circles that good old subject, the
jiorality of tenors, is again being discussed.
The most delightful Belinda the writer remembers to
nave seen was Nellie Stewart when she played “Our
Boys ” with the Lingards at the Theatre Royal, Melb., in
1576. Appleton was Sir Geoffrey, and Dampier Talbot
Champneys. The way Nellie sat on the table and swung
her legs, and screwed up her pretty, smudgy face into
serious expressions, is worth remembering 1 . It was pro-
favor e *' nc * a t * lat brought Nellie prominently into public
Dr. Eichard Hodgson, who has just exposed the alleged
medium, Madame Eusapia Palladino, is a graduate of Melb.
University, and now secretary of the American branch of
the Psychical Research Society. Madame had previously
fooled Lombroso and a lot of other continental scientists,
Professors Sidgwick and Oliver Lodge, of England, and
F. W. H. Myers, sec. of the English spook society.
Hodgson burst up the show by firstly explaining Eusapia’s
methods and then doing all her business himself.
Coleman, the eccentric dancer now agitating his legs at
Melb. Princess’s, is wont to faint on the smallest provoca-
tion. “Tiny” has won a reputation for wisdom by
posing as a preternaturally-solemn man.
Leoncavallo’s new opera—a musical story of Thomas
Chatterton, the boy poet and suicide—will be produced in
Italy at Easter. Great things are expected of “ Chatter-
ton,” which will probably set the musical world talking
about the hungry young genius who wipe ! himself out
with a dose of poison 125 years ago.
Miss Gerrard, the latest and least of Melbourne singing
girls to be sent ’Ome, writes the usual letter re her voice.
Santley, she says, has expressed himself as very much
pleased with her organ of sound, and “ the improvement
already noticeable in her singing.” The damsel left for
London six months, or less, ago, and after getting there
she was obliged to run away to Scotland to recruit her
health, she says. She made a “lengthy sojourn” in
Scotland. So the journey ’Ome, the loss of health, the
lengthy sojourn aforesaid, and a reasonable time for
making a noticeable improvement in her singing, have all
happened between the dates of her leaving Melbourne
and her letter to hand last week. Miss Gerrard has
faith in herself, but that’s not much use to the pos-
sessor of a thin voice and weak chest. One of Florence
Young’s best notes would blow her off her feet.
The average mummer in these cold hard days seems to
divide his life into two parts ; three fourths of the time he
is out of a job, and the other fourth he is being secured
with great difficulty at enormous expense.
“The Silver King” had eight years ago brought 11. A
Jones £lO,OOO, and it is still r inning. “ Pygmalion and
Galatea ” has brought W. S. Gilbert some £25,000. From
“The Private Secretary” the profits to Hawtrey were
some £lOO,OOO. “ Charley’s Aunt ” has returned to
Brandon Thomas about £30,000. No wonder that authors
turn from fiction to drama.
Manager Solomon, Adelaide : “ There have been two
Solomons. The wise one buiit a temple, the fool built a
theatre.”
Surely the Melb. Theatre Royal is unfairly handicapped
—the audience having to pass through the vestibule bar.
Melb. Princess’s panto, cost about t'2ooo to stage. The
electric city scene alone ran away with t“00.
Comic Opera Co. follows B. and B. at Sydney Lyceum.
It is doubtful, though whether anything fresh will be
played. J. C. Williamson seemingly prefers to produce
his operas in Melb., as a rule. lie has two new pieces
coining out from Musgrove—the forthcoming Gilbert and
Sullivan Savoy opera, and something fresh from Parisian
Planquette.
“ Djin Djin,” the Ann’s pantomime masterpiece, gene-
rated from Williamson’s idea of introducing a Jap. ballet
in “ The Mikado.” It will be seen in Sydney next Xmas
—if not before.
Mark Twain lectures in Ilingland, late in ’93, under the
management of Major Pond.
Thou-art-my-soul Robinson has re-named his brigandy
opera, which Guy Boothby has re-written, “The Handsome
Rausome ; or, the Brigand's Bride.”
“ Eve rather over-dressed her part.” Victorian Girl,’'
of the Argus, on Willi imson’s Tableaux.
Coppin has now four of his family engaged in stage
work, though he vowed none of them should go on the
“ boards.”
It is quite probable that “ Trilby” and the newco. from
G. Britain will make the r Australian debut in Syd ley
not at Melb. Princess’s.
Any amount of slaver is being bestowed on Mrs. Iveeley s
Jack Sheppard, but, turnin ; up tie London ATUEX.Ui M
for 1839, one finds it termed a disgrace to the stage. Oh,
if a Gaiety Girl only lives to be Ninety !
The latest “Tr liyisn.” A fa Jvenable dinner-table
ornament at Ameiiran houses just now is a woman's foot,
mode led in ice, which occupies a prominent position on a
glass salver. Under the influence of the warm lamplight,
it gradually melts to the strains of “Ben Bolt” and
Srengalian small-talk. The Yankees have discovered
poetry even in c >ld feet.
Miss Faber’s highest effort in Australia so far is her
d lightful acting as Mrs. Quern :1 in the love-scene with
T. the radge in “Rebellious Susan”—a delicious niece of
a -t which will never be forgotten by those pres nt.
Melb. : “ I see a fellow about town who got a splendid
chance to go on the stage here, in Creswick’s time, but so
mulled a long speech, which he had to deliver to the
tragedian, that he was sacked, and conseqi.e itly is now in
a flourishing business.”
Chemist Kruse’s will (“Johnny” the fiddler’s father)
shows an estate of only £550.
Mark Twain will be piloted through India by Carlyle
Smythe, while R.S.S. runs lecturer Charles Clark round
the Australias.
“ Djin-Djin ” goes to Sydney, Brisbane, and Adelaide
after doing five weeks at Melb. Princess’s. The firm ex
pects the Melb. season to pay the cost of preparation onlj
and looks to the other three capitals for profit.
The fever season has fairly begun at Cool-
gardie.
A guaranteed letter from Nelson’s Lady
Hamilton appears in the window of a Melbourne
pawnbroker.
Mr. It. G. Vallack, head of the big Sydney
softgoods firm of Gardiner and Co., suddenly died
last week of heart-disease, aged 65. Mr. Vallack
was a level-headed man of business who eschewed
parliamentary and civic glory ; consequently,
there are “no flies ” on the firm of Gardiner and
Co.
Private business worries, as well as shocks
to his democratic system, have told rather severely
upon Dr. Maloney, M.L.A., so the little member
for W. Melbourne is just now seeking a nerve
tonic in a trip to India. Being an object of Tory
scorn and Argus derision, this dapper Republican
possesses charms for The Bulletin, hence his
portrait on page 13. It has been alleged by the
enemy that Dr. Maloney went to India with a
view to joining one Geismardo, alias Professor
Richards, a somewhat shady “electric-healer,”
in whose system of treatment he sincerely
believes without regard to the healer’s ante-
cedents. As a matter of fact, he didn’t know
of Richards’ whereabouts at the time the journey
was decided upon, since when the wily Prof, has,
without authority, announced the coming of his
former champion to back him up. Meanwhile,
Dr. Maloney desires to heal himself with briny
breezes and change of scene. The Vic. Assembly
could have better spared many a cooler-headed
politician, and The Bulletin hopes to see Maloney
back again in his old fighting form as soon as
possible.
THE THEATRE HAT.

’Twas a hatful of tricks
That the milliner knew
And I missed the high-kicks
Through her hatful of tricks-
Tliere were sunflowers six,

Alas ! ’twas not surprising :
They danced together on the stage,
And each was paralysing.

At a recent Melb. Caledonian dinner one
M‘Gregor remarked that no country was governed
well unless Scotchmen were at the head of affairs.
“ Scotchmen,” said he, “ruled in Victoria when
things were going well, and Victoria would never
be again in a prosperous condition unless its ad-
ministration were largely entrusted to Scotchmen.
Shades of Munro and Gillies !
The Highland Gathering (20,000), at Syd-

Since Malthus has become the patron
saint of Maoriland women, the aged man who
harangues at the back door has ceased to have 12
young children at home. He has found that even

door in his face on learning that he has been
unable to work for 10 years, and has nevertheless
added to the population in that period.
Applications were lately invited for the
position of Resident Med. Officer of Adelaide
Hospital at £5OO p.a., and, although many applied,
the Board reported that none of the applicants
were eligible, and asked the Govt, to secure a
medical man from ’Ome. Premier Kingston re-
fused point-blank, and said he would appoint
none but a local man, and as the Board declines to
recommend anyone, there is now another “ Hos-
pital ” difficulty. The Bulletin hopes that by
“ local ” man the Premier doesn’t necessarily mean
an Adelaide man.
A decent old Wesleyan, Parson Wells, died
recently in Melbourne, and the obituarist lifts up
his voice in wailing, and states that he has gone to
join these great and honored associates in the
ministry—Butters, Draper, Binks, Dare, Symons
and Egglestone. Then he assumes a more cheerful
key, and remarks that there still remain to the
Church these indefatigable toilers —Waugh, Iron-
side, Blamires and Watsford. Which is very
consoling, no doubt, but the whole eleven of them
put together are not one-quarter so well-known as
Carbine, or Zimmerman, or even Alf. Josephs, of
Bendigo, and never will be, unless one of them
cements his murdered wife under the hearth-stone.
And in the rush and hurry of this sinful genera-
tion, the obituary of the great Butters and Binks,
deceased, sounds just as unimportant as the news
that a leading cockroach has pegged out in 1 -
kitchen. The irreverent Australian doesn’t even
know that there ever were any Butters and Binks
—and never will know it.

Dear Bulletin,—The representatives of
Her Gracious on the Australian mainland seem to
come more prominently before the public than
those in the Little Island. But at no time in the
history of Tas. have the Governors distinguished
themselves by the performance of praiseworthy
acts. Davy, the first I can remember for the
moment, was a most disreputable swab. Sored
was weak morally, too fond of elevating his
little finger, and is chiefly remembered for his
part in the formation of that hell on earth, Mac-
quarie convict-settlement. Arthur was a grant-
giving, insufferably arrogant autocrat; and poor
old Franklin doddered about the rough scrubs
looking for the North Pole, or something, and did
no harm and very little good. Denison was, per-
haps, a fairly good man in the wrong place, and
was intensely hated by his subordinates. Col.
Gore Brown was a gentleman, with no pomp or
vanity in his composition, but, as a ruler—enough
said. Du Cane was noted for his agricultural-
dinner speeches, and for his lady with her bull-
dogs, but for nothing worse ; whilst Strahan was
a jolly dog, who spent more money during his
term than all the rest put together. Acting-Gov.
Lefroy was painstaking and popular, but, p G

figureheads rolled into one, whose aim is fishing,
and whose name is- unknown to thousands of the
population. We import our Governors as we im-
port our stallions, and bulls, and rams, and, if
they turn out failures, we should be able to get rid
of them by shipping them back to the ’Ome they

A leading dame, of striking aspect, has
suffered a cruel disappointment. Her ardent
desire was to career round on wheels with the
vice-regal set—to which end she repaired to a
noted cycling teacher in a country town. After a
week’s hard work he told her it was no good—she
fell off on an average five times in as many
minutes. The dame has at last reluctantly come
round to the trainer’s point of view : “To be able
to ride a bicycle you should see straight in front
of you—if for any reason you can’t you had bettei
let it alone.”

In a somewhat wild and woolly Gippsland
district, where a Bulletin correspondent spent a
few days recently, most of the competitors entered
for the local New Year’s sports failed to put in an
appearance, and to eke out the bill a handicap
spitting-match was arranged on the ground. The
prize, a wooden pipe and five pounds of plug
tobacco, was offered by a resident storekeeper.
The winner, an expert axeman, spat from scratch,
and expectorated close upon 1 Aft. Each com-
petitor found himself in beer. Feeling ran very
high, and the betting was all in favor of a smal 1
Irishman, who crippled himself by blowing out a
necessary front tooth at the second try.
It is perhaps needful to mention that
this “par.” is not printed altogether
with the idea of popularising a new ,
indigenous form of athletics in Aus-
tralia. The other most interesting
item at the sports mentioned was a
battle between a retriever and a cross-
bred ram for £2 a-side. The dog was
knocked out in 7min., and was not
even accorded decent burial. Then tin-
owner of the dog fought the owner of
the ram for natural love and affection,
and the day’s entertainment concluded
with an attempt by a Comishman to
beat the local beer-drinking record for
ten pints. He finished 2sec. behind
time, and then refused to pay for the
beer as per agreement. Altogether it
was a chaste and elevating exhibition,
and demonstrated satisfactorily that tin-
healthy love of sport characteristic of
the true Australian is invariably equal
to the occasion, and capable of flourish-
ing under the most adverse circum-
stances.

A hungry, exhausted wretch
aauled out of a ship’s hold at Freeman-
tie, W.A., the other day, said he had
stowed away in a boiler, subsequently
covered by 500 tons of cargo,
with three bottles of water and
some bread and meat. He
thought four days would see
Freemantle, but he was cooped
up for a fortnight in total dark-
ness, run over by rats, and

Dear Bulletin, —You say, “ The most
sacred traditions of Melb. Govt. House are being
ruthlessly upset by the Brasseys, and Wallington
looks on in horror at all sorts of vulgar people,
with whom the Hupetouns would never have
associated, being invited to dinner and luncheon.’'
The fact of the matter is this--Wallington, of
yore, ran the vice-regal show for the particular
benefit of a set —in whom, of course, he sincerely
believed. He invited the guests (for Lady H. had
no friends to speak of), and the boss entertained
them. The Brasseys are disposed to select their
own friends, or acquaintances, instead of leaving
the private secretary to prescribe for them. The
new guests are probably less vulgar and snobbish,
on an average, than the mob that Wallington had
branded Al. The day of sassiety selection by a
long, thin shadow (Agnes Murphy refers to the
Wallington influence in her silly little book) is
ended, and the handy-man has found his official
level. When the Brasseys go to the Princess’s
they spread themselves in the manager’s box, with
the Freeman-Thomases and a lord or two, whilst
Wallington and any other small suite-potatoes
strive to present an imposing appearance in the
stage-box beneath. It is amusing, this new
arrangement, and it works one humorous result.
After Brassey has put in a “command night,"
ex-Acting-Gov. Madden comes along and engages
the manager’s box, that he may keep himself in

About the largest Xmas-box going was
the one which arbitrator Blake left behind him in
Wellington. When the hearing of the Midland
Railway dispute was finished, Blake wrote out a
voluminous decision and left it sealed up, with a
/ >n w’ l6 outs . lde setting forth that he wanted
A2lOO for his services. The Government and the
co. were both sanguine, but badly scared, and for
five days nobody had courage enough to apply for
YMi'h'imir' 6 dreadful document. There were
Ki,ooo involved; one way the co. would be
burst and the other the Seddon Government
would be ruined beyond repair. Finally, the co’s
solicitor applied for the paper and read it; and
then the Midland Railway syndicate fainted in a
corner, while the Government called wildly for
champagne and threw up its hat and never
saw it again. But all parties had a pleasant
Christmas holiday with the sealed verdict
preying on their minds, and the Midland
Co. lost the one chance of its existence during that
hve days waiting. The general manager and the
solicitor should have burgled the fateful packet in
the dead of night, and finding the contents were
unfavorable, should have replaced it with another
looking exactly the same so far as concerned the
outside, but containing a -and-costs
verdict m favor of the co. Then the largest
debenture-holder should have gone out and secretly
smothered Blake, by shoving him head-first into a
geyser, so that there could be no awkward ex-
planations afterwards, and after that they might
have formally opened the verdict with a light
heart. But they missed the opportunity, and it
will never, never return.

A Sydney Daily Telegraph obituary
notice, 30th Dec., ’O5
We are sorry to record the death of Mr. ’s St Ber-
nard bitch, Osborne (imported), by Nero 111., ex Katrine.
It is only last week that we eulogised so favorably this
grand hitch, and we feel certain that the fancy in general
sympathise with Mr. in his heavy loss, which is all the
more severe in consequence of Osborne having recently
visited Mr. —-’s dog Captain 11., from the result of which
union great things were anticipated. No reason can be
assigned for the cause of death, and the hitch looked all
right hut a short time prior to her being found dead in
her kennel.
Dear Bulletin,— You mention the fact of
a Yarrawonga man having produced a beautiful
flower from a marshmallow inoculated with the
sap of the pelargonium. Really, you amuse me !
I have now for some years been growing potatoes
(murphm (jardenienses or vuli/ares) from an
original stock inoculated by myself with the juice
of the salt-bush and of a pepper-tree. It is a
superior spud, and we use it mostly for Irish stew,
which thus requires no seasoning. Last year I
inoculated my strawberries with turnip-juice and
the raspberries with tomato-sap, producing in each
case a ten-fold larger crop, and one which gave
splendid financial results in connection with the
local jam-factory. But this year I have exceeded
the wildest hopes that ever floated through the
brain of a company-promoter. I inoculated a
healthy gooseberry-tree with sap from a sample of
wheat, spraying the plant regularly with soda-
water. And, I assure you, on the word of a
farmer, that all the pastry-cooks in Melbourne
cannot beat my crop of gooseberry tarts.—Rich-

Dear Bulletin, —Your “Plain English”
correspondent, “Heretic,” is a sturdy indivi-
dualist. He would have a privileged class in
sexual love. ‘ ‘ One man, many women—result,
normal reproduction ; one woman, many men—
result, sterility and specifically deterrent disease,”
says “Heretic,” without troubling to remark that
many women for every man were an impossible
state of society unless each woman scattered her
favors around. What “ Heretic” really means is
“ Some men, many women.” Those are my senti-
ments, always assuming that I ought to be
included among the polygamous minority. Let
the other fellows content themselves with one
virtuous lady each at the most, or only a portion

The most painful aspect of the Sheridan
case is the sufferings of the condemned man’s
devoted wife, whose desperate earnestness in
laboring for a commutation earned for her the
sympathy of all. For Sheridan personally it was
impossible to churn up much pity: a man
who had been directly concerned in the death of
at least half-a-dozen women, and who, after all,
couldn’t take the significant hint afforded by a
14-years’ sentence, almost deserved all the bad
luck in the criminal code.
Recent Bulletin testimony as to the
length and normal circumference of Gippsland

plated prodders used for prodding bits of lemon in
a squash, and when fully extended they
measure about four feet from start to finish, or a
little less. Dreadful worms, the vision says, but
not more evilly-disposed than the ordinary human
worm who applies for drinks.

One Australian city possesses a charitable
lady whose speciality cous sts in supplying tracts to
sick foreigners in the various hospitals. She im-

head in the fish-saloon, she looks out a bundle of
suitable literature and rushes to his assistance.
Her Greek tracts, however, are not imported.
They are supplied in manuscript by a deranged
clergyman in Callan Park, and she assumes that
they are full of beautiful sentiments, though as
likely as not they consist of wild essays’ on the

A native boy was arrested the other day at
Kimberley (S. Af.) for illegal diamond-buying, on the
following affidavit by Dr. Otto “lam a medical offici r
of the De Beers Convict Station. On the 23rd July, 1895,
convict No. 5200, David, alias Solomon, a convict under-
going sentence at the station, was admitted to the station
hospital. I examined him, and found symptoms of
tetanus, resulting apparently from an incised wound
about 2in. long on the inside of the calf of the leg, and
about sin. from the knee-joint. On the f 1 owing day I
considered it necessary to open the wound and see if
there was any extraneous matter inside, and on doing so
I found buried in the flesh, about 3in. deep, a piece of rag
tied into a small bundle. I removed the rag, and opened
it in the presence of the Chief Constable, and found it to
contain 31 rough and uncut diamonds. Th«p e diamonds
I handed to the superintendent of the station. ’

The British filibustering expedition whi- 1
invaded the Transvaal was badly licked by the
Boers and captured in short order. This mak -
the fourth time that the Boer and the Briton hav
met to the utter discomfiture of the latter, and tl e

people on this earth who can truthfully allege tin t
every time they have met the Briton they have
come out on top. The Mexican goes one better, fi r
he has met Britain, France, and Spain, and ha
definitely licked one of them, and without actually
licking the other two he succeeded in showing
them that it would be much better for tlvnr
health to go away and leave him in peace with > i
getting the thing they came for. He also casual' j
mashed up a quantity of loose Belgians and Aus-

Germany was delirious with joy over the B > :•

subscriptions were being taken up for the Boers
who captured Jameson’s army and ran it in. The
Yankee bond of brotherhood col lap ed badly at
the first mention of the Venezue’a trouble, and
this other “ bond ” seems to luxe gone, the same

There was presented, the other day, to N.S.
Wales Assembly a return, moved for by E. M. Clark,
M.L.A., of the working of the great land-resumption
swindle on the railway extension from St. Leonards to
Milson’s Point, North Sydney. Said extension is 24 miles
long and the amount of land (unimproved) which had to
be resumed was a fraction over two acres, which was
obtained at a cost of just about £6OOO an acre. Also, for
some reason not fully explained, the Government took
nearly eight acres more, which was not actually
wanted, at nearly £7OOO an acre. This is, roughly
speaking, somewhere between twice and three times the
average selling value of land in that locality. There are
sundry curious features about the list of purchases. One
man, who probably was a harder customer to deal with
than the rest, is reported as having got £2OOO for three-
sixteenths of an acre. Another got £6OO for a little over
one-eighth of an acre, which wasn’t wanted—in fact, it
was resumed entirely by mistake. Another person’s
1 vnd was resumed by mistake at a cost of £3OO.
Itather less than I acre, which wasn’t needed, was pur-
chased for £2720-at the rate of £ll,OOO an acre.
Taking it all round, the land which was resumed because
it was wanted is set down at £12,000, and the land
resumed “in excess of railway requirements”—in other
words, the land which wasn’t wanted—seems to have cost
£5',800. With all these figures in view, The Bulletin
st ill wants to know when a little Bill is going to be intro-
duced providing that the land-tax valuation, with, say, 10
per cent, added for disturbance, is to be the standard of
sill future resumptions ? Under the present system every-
body seems to get about twice as much as the fair value
of his property, and the man who makes the most row
gets four times as much.

Dalgety and Co., Limited, present a better
b-■dance-sheet than is usual in the stock and station and
\v v -I business at this disastrous season. During the year
/■II led 30th June, 1895, the co. successfully met the
interest on £2,866,915 owing upon debentures, wrote
down the book-value of its assets by £102,000, and still
has a net profit for the year of £83,896, which enables it
to pay 8 per cent, dividend, and have £3826 to add
to the balance carried forward. Also, the reserve fund
'if £130,000 is intact, Considering that wool has dropped
16 per cent, since ’93, and 33 per cent, since ’B4, this is a
remarkably good showing. At the same time, the
£2,866,915 of debentures Took rather top-heavy. This
consists of irredeemable 4 and 44 per cent, stock, and four
different kinds of terminable debentures varying from 3
to 44 per cent. The average rate of interest is a shade
over 4 per cent., and when Dalgety and Co. borrow money
in England at 4 per cent., and then invest their reserve
fund in British consols at 2f per cent., there seems to be
a considerable loss on the deal somewhere. At the same
time, the fact that the co. has commenced to issue deben-
tures in a small way, at 3 per cent., shows that its credit
is very high. It also takes a good deal of the glitter off
the two Government loans which were recently floated at
the same figure.
* * * *
Some of the recent doings of the City of Mel-
bourne Bank liquidator are remarkable—to put the matter
mildly. Just before the collapse, the bank received £3OOO
from'the Prahran Council to pay interest on its deben-
tures in London, and £7600 from the Board of Works for
a similar purpose. One Judge decided that in the first
case the bank was only an agent and the money was held
in trust, and he directed that it should be repaid in full
instead of going into the general smash. In the second
case, another Judge decided the exact contrary. Then
the Full Court considered both cases, and resolved defi-
nitely that both sums should be repaid as a prior claim
on the assets. Now, the liquidator has got permission
to “blew” a lot more of the assets in fighting
these two decisions (with the creditors’ money) before
the British Privy Council! The liquidator himself
has no personal interest in the matter. All he really
needs is a legal decision which will give him authority to
take one of two. courses, either of which will—or ought
to—suit him equally well, and the Full Court gave him
the authority. He can have nothing to gain in
cozening the Prahran Council for the benefit of the other
creditors, or in dozening the other creditors for the sake
of the Prahran Council. But the habit of fighting every
small legal question to the bitter end, regardless of ex-
pense, is characteristic of liquidators. The hungry legal
sharks gather round the carcase and presumably whoop
on the liquidator in his wild career, and when he spends
a very b g sum in law-costs trying to get the very best in-
formation as to who a very small sum should be paid to it
is called “ protecting the interests of the creditors.”

Robert Byrne, a South Melbourne auctioneer,
lately went bankrupt for a few hundreds of thousands,
and his estate paid 20s. in the £ and left £BOOO over to be
handed back to the insolvent. Whereupon the court, in a
prosaic, cold-blooded, unemotional fashion, gave him an
ordinary, plain discharge just as if he had been a common
one-Fink-in-the-£ insolvent. That court should have
been moved to tears, and should have made an entry on
its records in a-broken voice that there was one honest
man left in Melbourne, and given Byrne his certificate
printed in gold letters on vellum. And then the dis-
charged insolvent should have been escorted home in a
carriage by the Governor, with a brass band in front and
all the Judges riding behind, and after their carriages
there should have followed an interminable procession of
bankrupt boomers on foot, with the men who paid 19s.
in the £ walking next to the last carriage, and the men
who paid 4d. running on all fours in the Just at the remote
ehd of the caravan. Melbourne doesn’t deserve to have
an insolvent like Byrne.

If the Kingston Ministry goes down at next
S.A. elections it will probably be by reason of its financial
policy—which is the weak spot in almost every Austral-
asian Government. Kingston has done much better than
some of his predecessors, yet there is another probable
deficit looming, and S.A. is weary of deficits. Still, it is
noteworthy that, taking the period from ’9l to June, ’95,
S.A. and Maoriland are the only two provinces where the
public debt has decreased in proportion to population ;
they each owe about £2 7s. less per head than they did in
’9l. Also they are both in a pretty tight place, as all
these provinces are when the foreign capital stops rolling
in. Tasmania and Westralia meanwhile have a boom on,
or in immediate prospect—and in proportion to popula-
tion, they have borrowed three times as much in the last
four years as all the other five provinces combined. There
is a dreadful sameness about booms in these parts-they
all come from borrowed money. Westralia has naturally
the biggest boom - it has borrowed £lB per head within
four years: Tasmania, having borrowed £7 Bs. per head,
is getting up the next best boom. Victoria, which is
actually paying off £250,000 of its past debts out of the
year’s revenue, isn’t booming.

The latest big Melbourne insolvency, that of
Michael Ferguson, represents an almost total loss of
£170,000 to the City of Melb. Bank, and £77,000 to the
Bank of S.A., while six other banks are let in for con-
siderable sums. The mortgages and amounts owing to
“ secured ” creditors are stated at £404,000, and the
whole value of the securities is set down at £60,000.
Under these conditions what is a secured creditor ? The
A.M.P. Society is also in the schedule for £23,637 Bs.
Altogether, it is a fine big boom insolvency, with half-a-
million liabilities, and very little in the way of assets.

The N.S. Wales revenue for last half-year was
£4,936,620, and the expenditure £5,086,239, so there is
another apparent deficiency of £149,619. Treasurer Rem,
however, represents the balance as a surplus of £535,9ij6.
This result is arrived at by charging £573,783 to the
previous half-year, and £173,405 to “ 1894 previous
years,” so that even yet it seems G. Reid hasn t finished
making additions to the great “ Dibbs deficit.” This sort
of thing is eminently dispiriting. When the public
accounts were put on the alleged “ cash basis,’ each year s
expenditure and each year’s revenue were to stand against
one another, and if the money that went out of the
revenue during the year for whatever purpose was more
than the amount which came in, then the difference was
to represent the deficiency. There was to be no saddling
of this year’s shortage on to previous years, which does
no good and only makes confusion. And, apparently,
Mr. Reid is still not quite finished with the old stupid
system, whereby the year, say 1894, closes with a surplus,
and the said surplus appears in Coghlan’s statistics, and
there is a great whoop in consequence ; and then in 1895
half-a-million is charged back to ’94 and makes a big
deficit, and more sums are charged back to it in ’96 and
’97 and ’9B; and ’95 ends with a surplus, which is also pub-
lished with much joy, and is afterwards obliterated
through amounts being charged back in ’96 and ’97 and
’9B and ’99, and so on ad infinitum.
* * * *
Q. revenue and expenditure are both rising.
For the half-year just ended taxation returns have in-
creased by £22,000 and railway revenue by £70,000 as
compared with the half-year ended 31st Dec., ’94. On
the other hand, ordinary expenditure has increased by
£67,000 and loan expenditure by £138,000. About the only
good point of Boodlewraith Government was the economy
which Treas. Nelson enforced in ’93 and ’94. It looks as
if the province felt it was safely over the “burst,” and
was getting ready to borrow and boom again.
But things are on the mend generally. Even
little Tasmania has increased her 1894 revenue by £60,064
to make the total of £761,942 for 1895. Custom receipts
improved by £23,000. The change in the incidence of
land and income taxation decreased the land-tax by
£19,000, and increased the income-tax from £lsB9—the
first instalment under the new system to £46,528. And
there was a small increase under nearly every other head
of revenue. They are slow in Tasmania, and, at time of
writing, the Treasurer didn’t know what his expenditure
was.

From the Judge’s farewell speech to Jabez
Balfour, previous to giving that podgy sinner 14 years
penal servitude ; “ You stand convicted of frauds extend-
ing over a series of years, and which I am satisfied you
carried out in connection with the group of companies
with which you were connected. . . . And you have
been the means of dishonestly obtaining from the public
large sums of money. ... It has been suggested that
during the period in which your fraudulent operations
were carried out, had times been more auspicious, if there
had been greater commercial prosperity in the country,
your operations would not have been disastrous —might
even have been successful. Success might have covered
the fraud and prevented its discovery, but success cannot
turn fraud into honesty. ... In the course of this
trial, certain crimes were spoken of as vulgar crimes, as
though a distinction should be drawn between the com-
mon methods of the ordinary criminal and crimes accom-*-
plished by the ingenious devices of men of education and
position. All I can say is ” Well, the learned gent
gave Jabez 14 years. The words in italics are specially

There are innumerable buyers in Sydney for
N.S.W. Government stock, and the supply is so scanty
that during December, ’95, only £9O worth changed
hands. It sold at £ll2, and at that price it only yields
the investor, allowing for the loss on redemption, a shade
•over per cent. Therefore N.S.W. securities are now
going in Sydney at a better price than G. Reid’s famous
3 per cent, loan realised in London, and the blank foolish-
ness of that famous deal sticks out more conspicuously
than ever.

The finding of the Hands Across the Sea mine
(W.A.) may be set down as another example of the
horrors of Der-rink. A party of prospectors were tramp-
ing patiently along the dusky track, when they came to a
bush shanty. They had one drink apiece and moved on—
all except the boozer of the party, who stayed behind.
An hour later he started after his mates with a thousand
bees buzzing in his head, and when he came to a cross-
road he lost all recollection of the instructions he had
received, and started with a demoniac howl on the wrong
track. A mile or two further a bullock-puncher told him
in a flow of kindly profanity that he had got off the gory
road,‘but he pointed out certain land-marks bv which he
might strike across country and find the blanky track
agai rf. He struck across accordingly at a blasphemous
jog-trot, arid half-way he stubbed his toe against a
magnificent outcrop and came down with a thud. When
he had finished hopping round dizzily with his foot in
both hands and cursing, he found that, he was standing
•on gold, and it was the Accursed Drink that had brought,
him 'there. An Adelaide paper started this lie, which
seems a verv probable lie as lies go.

“ Bayley’s Reward claim,” says Murchison
Times, “ has a record to date of 53,5000 z., this being the
product of 8440 tons. The average yield right through is

late. The mine has been the most prolific producer in
Western Australia, the Great Boulder, New Chum, Star
of the East and Consolidated Murchison (Day Dawn)
•coming next in the order named. The combined
production of the last-named mines has reached
56,0u00z. ; so that Bayley’s Reward claim has yielded
nearly as much as all of the others ” But Bayley’s Re-

A correspondent suggests that in view of the
difficulty experienced by prospectors in many cases owirg
to lack of water to try prospects, Govt, would do
wisely by supplying iron tanks, say 400 gals. each, made
flat, to fit the beds of iron drays constructed durably for
the purpose—said articles to be lodged at each police-
station in mining districts and lent out to any
bona-fide miners on their finding security, and for
prospecting purposes only. Miners would find business
people to back them, and it would be the cause of new
goldfields being up. *

off to Westralia via Italy. He has engaged a German
manager at £2OOO a year.
* * * *
Tired of prospecting the hundreds of outcrops
around Coolgardie, of coarse-grained, milky-white, and
rock-salt colored, and, above all, barren-looking quartz,
work is directed to find somewhere or other some
formations similar to the Boulder, which has proved itself
a mine, and, better still, has done more towards taking
the wool off John Bull than all the others put together.
A leader, 9in. thick, with a formation 2ft., found two and
a-half miles north of Coolgardie, is the latest thing
“ exactly like the Boulder ore.”

Ed. Bulletin, —A word about the West. The
other day an ad. appeared in a Perth paper for 20 car-
penters to proceed to Coolgardie. Forty men rolled up
at the appointed time, and, as the agents found difficulty
in selecting, a ballot was decided on. Forty slips of paper
were prepared—2o blanks and 20 having the name of the
employing firm. By the time this work was finished 20
more carpenters had appeared, and the agents deemed it
advisable to go straight on with the ballot while they had
a chance. One applicant generously supplied a hat (he
never saw n again), the slips were thrown in, and a mad
rush ensued for the coveted prizes. A policeman tried to
keep order, and, finding this impossible, wisely retired.
After the battle the question of “ terms ” arose, and they
were : £4 a per week (for Coolgardie !), lucky winners to
pay their own fares, keep themselves, and buy their own
water. As 90 per cent, of them were stone-broke, the
result was a crowd of gloomy faces, about the only
fortunate one being the man who stole the hat. There is
more demand for carpenters here than for anything else,
and yet crowds of “swampers” are landing every week.—
T. H. Wilson, Perth, 18th Dec.

G. M‘Leod Matheson, formerly a Sydney
broker and N.S. Wales M.L.A., who met with so terrible a
death by falling from a Coolgardie hotel verandah and
being “ staked ” on a fence, was busily engaged for two
hours before his decease in signing documents which were
brought by cyclists from Kalgoorlie, where the unfor-
tunate Matheson had large business dealings.

Hill End mine, Broad Arrow, for the month,
62 tons, yielding 10640 z. of gold ; average over 17oz.
* * * *
The story goes that two unemployed men from
Sydney Labor Bureau, who recently secured Govt, rail-
way passes and went to the country to try their luck as
gold-miners, induced a Crow Mountain selector to let
them prospect for gold on his ground, at the nominal
rental of 10s. per month. Soon they struck a patch, the
first three tons of which yielded 171 oz. of gold, which,
added to about £5OO worth of specimens, gave over £llOO.
The next 14 tons yielded £5500, and now, so says the
story, these miners are offered £15,000 for their claim.
* * * *
It will be interesting to note the wriggles of the
N.S.W. Cabinet re the Sydney Harbor collieries leases
question.
* * * *
The miners and laborers employed at Burraga
(N.S. W.) copper-mines have struck, owing to the owner’s
refusal to grant an increase of Is. per day wages, the pre-
sent ruling prices being 6s. per day for miners and ss. per
day for laborers.
* * * *
The Lady Jersey mine, Drake, has been sold to
a Sydney syndicate for £7550. From all The Bulletin
hears, the syndicate has got much the better end of the
bargain.
* * * *
At Wyalong during last year Channon’s battery
crushed 2153 tons of stone for 37960 z. free gold, without
reckoning tailings and concentrates—the average being
loz. 15dwt. 6gr. free gold. The largest cake was from the
Welcome Stranger, namely, 11330 z., from 185 tons.
At Nicolas and Reymond’s battery, from Oct. 30 to
Dec. 31, 780 tons were treated for 11930 z. of gold, an
average of a little over an ounce and a half per ton. The
biggest lot treated was 260 tons from the Perseverance
f0r6200z., and the best average was 14 tons from Hen-
nessy and party for 50oz.
* * * *
The Lady Augusta mine, Eidsvold (writes a
Bulletin correspondent) has put up a local record by
cleaning up on 19th Deo. 38 tons stone for 418 oz. gold
just lloz. per ton. Total yield for year, 194 tons for
1040 oz. gold, to which must be added 250 z. from pyrites,
making the bulk yield soz. lOdwt. per ton. The yield for
’94 was 220 tons for llOOoz. The mine is owned and
worked by 11 men.
* * * *
Gympie’s year closes none too brightly, though
the field has seen worse days than ’95. The yield was
, 78,8870 z. from 80,392 tons —a good enough average ; and
£125,266 was paid in divs. The pity is that the profits
came from so few claims—the Phoenix is responsible for
more than half, £63,750, and the Phoenix P.C. Tribute
paid £17,775. 1 North Glanmire paid £10,800; 1 North
Phoenix, £6OOO ; Jones’s Caledonian single lucky crushing
brought £4950 ; and the Crown and Phoenix’s legacy from
’94 yielded £2166. Add Phoenix Golden Pile, £2400; 1
North Smithfield, £9OOO ; S. N. Zealand Junction, £1350 :
and you have almost the “ demnition tottle ” of Gympie
div.-paying claims for the year.
There is hardly a field in Australia (bar Ballarat)
so well supported as Gympie. As fast as the money
comes in in divs. it goes out in calls, and out of last year’s
£125,266 profits, £117,566, or thereabouts, were put back
in the ground again. Many claims are crushing con-
tinuously, and making ends meet, without being able
to get * on the div. list. Nothing under about
15dwts. to the ton has much chance of paying
a div. on Gympie, but a claim can exist on about lOdwt.
The trouble is that when the patch of good stone comes
it generally finds a lot of accumulated liabilities or neces-
sary works waiting to be provided for, and the div.
vanishes before it is fairly grasped.
Gympie’s total yield since the field started is
estimated at £2,035,916, which, at £3 10s. per oz., was
worth £7,125,706. The average annual yield since the
end of ’77 has been 78,3840 z. -with which last year’s
result (78,8870 z.) closely coincides.
* * * *
Charters Towers-yield for last year was a little
better than the oz. per ton —251,5770 z. from 249,520 tons.
The year before Mills United was booming, and the re-
turn was 263.8740 z. But the field was never better than
it is to-dav. Dec. yield : 21,0420 z. from 17,606 tons.
* « * »
Thanks to cyanide, Croydon’s total yield in-
creases while the yield from the mines is lessening—not
for want of gold, but for want of water. The 1894 total
was 81,2080 z. For 1895 the mines produced 54,7210 z.
from 39,094 tons which pans out much better per ton
crushed than either Towers or Gympie figures, Cyanide
got 33,5190 z. from 27,680 tons total, 66,774 tons, 88,2400 z.
And another big dam or two on the True Blue and Golden
Gate lines would have brought the figures very nearly to
the 100,00Coz. mark.
* * * *
The best-boomed outside-show on Charters
Towers the Golden Surprise—has at last received the
stamper-test. A crushing of 80 odd tons put through
yielded something over 2oz. The odd pennyweights in
this case do not matter, as the shareholders were looking
forward to from 6 to 8 oz. per ton, according to the elasti-
city of their respective imaginations. The result justifies
the name of the mine. As the reef, or leader, is onlv 4 or
5 in. thick, in hard country, and is composed mostly of
urown-stone, the disappointment at the result is further
accentuated.
Mills United, Charters Towers, is reducing
its crushing- engagements. Cause—falling away of out-
put. The mine is now keeping only 20-head stamps going
at the Burdekin mill.
Brilliant Extended Block, Charters Towers:
Prospecting "haft is now down about 1600 ft. It is esti-
mated the Brilliant reef will be cut at 2250 ft.—about the
middle of the year. It is also, of course, confidently ex-
pected that the reef will be cut, but that is another
matter. Reconstruction, for the second time, is round-
aboutly hinted at in the last report.
Peabody mine, one of the properties of the Mos-
man (English) Co., Charters Towers, has crushed 97£ tons
for 2710 z. The stone is from a recent discovery in the
shaft, in an under-a-cloud portion of the field, which
should now look up.

When your artesian bore is down and you are
drawing a million gallons per diem it isn’t all plain sailing.
At a Central Queensland bore the other day, the pressure
suddenly dropped from 40lb. to about half that. The
casing had begun to “ bridge”—that is, to silt up and fill
with mineral deposit.

Vic. coal output for 1895 was 198,703 tons,
being over 20,000 tons more than in 1894. Vic. coalminers
number 782.
* * * *
During 1895 Victoria produced 713,9000 z. of
gold, thus retaining the auriferous premiership of Aus-
tralia, and giving employment to almost 33.000 miners.
Since ’5l, Vic. has produced 60,120,5930 z., value
£240,482,372 sterling.
* * * *
Vic. last year exported 19,035,1381 b. butter,
1,006,9251 b. cheese, 459,154 rabbits, 34,029 head of game and
poultry, 11,134 cases fruit, and 23,396 doz. eggs, through
the Agricultural Department, in addition to large quan
tities sent independently of Govt. In every case then
was a big increase on the ’94 export.

Whilst' cattle-hunting on the Tararua Range -s,
Wairarapa (M.L.), one of a party slipped in the good old
anecdotal way, and, to save himself, gripped a root, which
not only stopped his fall, but, loosening, disclosed quart;
carrying payable gold. Rumor at once clothed the valley
in gold, but when the lucky ones went back to locate their
reef, they could not find it! There is a party now se _>k-
ing that Eldorado.

“To properly carry out the duties of a
oolonial Governor one must have the patience of
Job, the industry of a Chinaman, and the
übiquity of a French provincial Mayor.”—Sir. W.
Robinson.
It is. notable, in view of Judge Windeyer’s
proposed visit to England, that his Honor inter-
viewed Hogan, secretary of the alleged Australian
party in the Commons, when the latter was in
Sydney recently.
Bard Fitzgibbon has in MS. material for
about five fat volumes of “poetry,” which, how-
ever, are not to be printed until he is dead. The
Bulletin presumes that this is a condition of his
life -assurance policy.
Michael Davitt knows all about the Mount
Rennie trial, concerning which he, while in
Sydney, made minute enquiries. His book on
Australia will possibly be published in England
during the visit of Judge Windeyer, who° will
then have aji: opportunity of giving his version to
the public.
Agnes Murphy, in her
“ One Woman’s Wisdom,” sug
gests that her “ apparent Care-
lessness about dress was really
the outcome of deep study.”
Agnes, it is clear, firmly believed
that all Smellbourne found a
subtle charm in her aggressive
unloveliness.
The daughters of E. A.
Buxton, Gov. Powell’s brother,
have published a volume of photo-
graphs, recording a tour to the
East, the descriptive letterpress
including extracts from private
communications. A specimen :
“Father’s dining costume gets
odder every night. He now
wears, by Way of full dress, the
nether part of his pyjamas with
all his other clothes tucked into
them, and his old ulster above.”
One of Australia’s few living
millionaires is noted for the
meanness that passeth all under-
standing. He suffers from a de-
lusion that he is slowly losing
all his wealth, and his existence
is consequently wretched. The
last man who got any money out
of him was a ne’er-do-well relation,
who upon his first appeal was
repelled. “All right,” he said,
“I’m not a very pretty object—
my toes are showing out of my
boots, my pants are torn, I don’t
smell like Araby the Blest, and the
hair is sticking out of the top of
my hat. I shall go and sit out-
side your front gate, and tell
passers-by and visitors who I am. ”
“Go and be damned !” the o’ ’
man growled ; but after the wreck
had been there for a few days,
“a message came from the
house.”
Evangelist Varley leathers away, in a
Melb. religious paper, last week, against a Sydney
pietist, who puts “ten columns of sin ” into bus
journal, and whose editor, aq. ex-clergyman, told
Varley to mind his own business.
A Member of N.S.W. Leg. Council who
never gives charity promiscuously on week-days,
provides himself every Sunday with a number of
3d. pieces, which he distributes to such ‘ de-
serving objects ” as he may meet while on his way
to church. The Domain deadbeats know tins
“ weakness,” and stick him up with surprising
regularity.
One satisfactory feature about S.A. Gov.
Buxton is his athletic figure and entire absence of
adiposity. The ex-brewer is a fine man for his
age, and it is bad luck for him that his Jeff eristic
face makes him an easy victim for the caricaturist.
Justice Windeyer was, when in Parlia-
ment, the author of the Act which enables
“ colonial ” barristers to occupy seats upon N.S.W.
Supreme Court Bench, and by a coincidence was
the first Australian barrister appointed under the
Act.
Ex-Premier Parkes wants a lump sum as
a grant from N.S.W. Parliament; he will not, it
is declared, ever take an annuity. “Old Jack”
Robertson declined an annuity and got a lump
sum, which he at once distributed amongst his
creditors.
Mark Twain intends writing his book on
Australia while in South Africa. He was offered
.£2OO each for ten articles for Harper’s Maga-
zine, but refused, as he reckoned they would spoil
the book, which he estimates will be worth
<£lo,ooo.
In her second book, “Snags,” Miss Sophie
Osmond, a Melb. pen-lady, refers to the shearers’
strike as “ the nearest approach to an outbreak of
socialism that has ever happened in Australia.”
Miss Osmond, by the way, is the Austral Salonite
who passed the cake to Kipling.
When the convict-ship John Berry arrived
at Sydney, in 1820, she had on board a prisoner
named David Lee, aged 28 years, who finally
gravitated to Parramatta Asylum, where he died
on last Boxing Day in his 103rd year. There can
be no doubt of his age, as his “record ” still exists.
Lady Carington, when in Australia, was
never suspected of being a poetess. Yet the
British Australasian credits her with a contri-
bution (poetical), called the “Legend of Kil-
larnev,” which is to appear in the Primrose
Lea ueG v ' ette. Surely, it is her Ladyship of
Jersey who i j meant!
Noli,ik r Chief Justice Way nor Judge
Boucaut (S.AJ depends upon the bench for a
living. Way is a farmer and pastoralist; and
Boucaut breeds horses for the Indian market, and
is believed to be mali ig much money. Judge
Bundey, who is as pi or as he is popular,, is an
enthusiastic yachtsman.
London Daily Chronicle dismisses Jen-
nings Carmichael’s book of poems in one wither-
ing line. It just quotes a bit of J. F. Hogan’s
eulogistic introduction—about the young lady’s
gifts—and says : “If Mr. Hogan believes this, he
will believe anything.” Richard Le Gallienne
writes most of the reviews of poetry in the
Chronicle.
Ex-Governor Carington has placed his
family estate, Wycombe Towers, in the market
for sale, not, mind (as he is careful to let it be
known), because he is at all hard-up, but simply
for the reason that he has bought (at a much less
price than Wycombe will fetch) an old estate
which belonged to his mother’s family, Gwydir
Castle, in Wales.
Mrs. Threlfall, of Sydney, several of
whose lately-issued and successful “Starlight
Songs ” The Bulletin had the honor of first
publishing, has had a book of “Cradle Songs”
accepted by publisher John Lane, of London.
It will be out in the spring. Mrs. Threlfall, in
adopting the vein indicated by the title of her new
literary venture, has found her obvious metier.
According to the Sydney Sunday Times
penlady, ex-Premier Parkes “ once dreamt that he
was Prime Minister of England, and he has vivid
recollections of stormy interviews with the Queen.
Eventually the old lady took a liking to him, and
they were about to be married when little Cobden,
TOM REEVES of Tasmania, who claims to he champion
axeman of the world.
who was in bed at the time, dealt him a blow in
the face and shattered the illusion. ”
Westralians now in Melbourne say that
ex-Governor Robinson spends his time in London
principally in writing letters of introduction on
behalf of a shoal of speculative company-promoters
to prominent persons in Australia. Calvert, the
muoh-advertising, came along with a pocket-book
full of them. They all beseech consideration for
the bearers as bosom friends of his ex-Excellency.
E. L. Ettershank died at his residence,
West Melb., on Ist inst. The name evokes a
crowd of recollections of a most exciting period in
Victorian history. Glass, Quarterman, and
Ettershank were proceeded against by Govern-
ment far a breach of privilege, the proceedings
being taken by the Leg. Assembly itself without
the intervention of the law-courts. The matter
was in connection with the battles between the
squatting interest and a legislative majority over
the land. The .Judges released the three persons
mentioned from an imprisonment ordered by Par-
liament, whereupon G. P. Smith, as Attorney-
General, appealed to the Privy Council, which
upheld him, but nevertheless the offenders were
n>■bi In I L-u'k t< • prison. The Government was
satisfied with establishing the supremacy of Par-
liament over the Supreme Court.
Senior-sergeant Cassin, in charge of the
police at Adelong, N.S.W., died the other day.
The Sergeant was second in command at the fight
at Wantabadgery station when Moonlight’s party
stuck up the homestead. It is not generally
known that the Moonlight gang proved a great
disappointment to the police. At the time the
Kelly scare was in full swing on both sides of the
Murray, and some <£Booo was offered for the Kellys’
capture, dead or alive. When news of the stick-
ing-up reached Gundagai, Adelong and Wagga,
the impression that the Kellys held Wantabadgery
was rife, and every constable within 30 miles who
could be spared armed himself to the teeth and
hurried off to the scene. When the fight was done,
it was found that two bushrangers had been shot
dead, and Senior - constable Bowen mortally
wounded, and that the prisoners were an almost
unknown crowd who, with the exception of Scott
(“ Moonlight ”) were amateurs in crime.
Gov. Fowell Buxton is now known in
Adelaide as “ Chooky ! ”
On the eve of their discovery of the
famous Brothers’ Home tin-mine ? Tas., tha
Krushkas called at Sunnyside, Ringarooma,
and asked for a night’s lodging. Foreigners,
unknown and penniless, they failed to create a
favorable impression, and were shown into
the. stable as a favor. Fact is stranger than
fiction. The Krushkas now own Sunnyside,
and many thousands of acres around it, and
one of the brothers married a daughter of the
house at which they were told that “ they’d
find plenty of old bags in the stalls to make a
shakedown.” But, notwithstanding the hun-
dred thousands they have won from their
mine, Sunnyside, one of the most beautiful
little homesteads in Tasmania, is now in utter
ruins.
A yarn about cricketer Bonnor—who,
it will be remembered, attained English social
fame through Ruskin’s gush over his magnifi-
cent physical proportions. Augustine Pirrell
(“ Obiter Dicta ”) says he met the Australian
at the Johnson Club, Fleet-street. The talk
was about Dr. Johnson. Bonnor bluntly re-
marked that he had never heard of the man
until that evening. When somebody sniggered,
Bonnor, flushed, added : “ And, what’s more,
where I came from you can ride a horse 60
miles a day for three days and never meet a
soul who has heard of Johnson either. But I
say this much, if I hadn’t been Bonnor, the
cricketer, I would have liked to be Dr. John-
son.”
The new poet-laureate is admirably
chosen. Once, some honor attached to the
office : it was a badge of literary merit which
a people’s poet might be proud to wear. Now,
the laureate is royalty’s tame cat, its official
adulator and greaser. He pares the royal
corns, trims the royal nails, and is allowed to
hang about the royal kitchen and fry odes
and dirges in butter when there is a birth, or
marriage, or death to be officially celebrated
or deplored. No better poet could be chosen
to perform these duties than the highly-
respectable Alfred Austin. His verse is
sometimes melodious and clever, and always
utterly uninspired. It is absolutely loyal
and absolutely proper. Royalty may confi-
dently rely upon him to purr nothing which
might not appear in the Court Circular
itself. The new poet-laureate is admirably
chosen.
In connection with the proposal to settle
an annuity on patriarch Parkes, instead of giving
him a lump sum in cash, it might be well to
remember that the Old Man has, more than once,
made public boast of his conviction that he would
live till he is 120 years old. Wouldn’t it be
cheaper to start him (with <£lo,ooo added) as chief
prize in an art union, the winner to take over the
responsibility of looking after him for the remain-
der of his days ?
There was once in Victoria a Surveyor-
General named Ligar who mapped out a track
through Gippsland to the Kiandra diggings. The
route was known as “Ligar’s Track,” and so indi-
cated by calico bills nailed on the trees along it. It
was a gruesome and awful path, and those who
used it took their lives in their hands. One
digger who went by it took the trouble on his
return journey to cut all the G’s out of the name
of the surveyor. Ever since then it has been
known as “Liar’s Track.” A warning to care-
less surveyors.
Judge Windeyer— The Bulletin doesn’t
quite like to call him Justice Windeyer—says he
is not necessarily going to retire on the expiration
of his leave. But the fact that theS.M. Herald,
which has always been deeply in the Judge’s con-
fidence, farewells him may be taken as indicating
that it is his Honor’s present intention to retire.
His leave will probably be devoted to fishing in the
Privy Council pond. Failing a P.C.-ship it is
just possible that his Honor may be offered the
Chief Justiceship of Ashantee, which country
England is about to annex and civilise —by
degrees.
The Australian linotype record has been set
by Mr. Frank Bevan, of Sydney D.T. composing
staff—3ls lines of minion (equal to 17,940 ens),
without a lead, headline, or break of any kind, in
one hour !
A tin of Australian canned meat, over 20
years old, was the other day opened in Melbourne.
It was perfectly fresh, though flavorless, after
travelling 400,000 miles or so on a coasting steamer
since its purchase.
‘ ‘ The great American continent, bounded
on the north by the Aurora Borealis, on the south

Day of Judgment.”
Cutting from the Sheffield (Eng.) Weekly
Telegraph : “ Sometimes Australian snakes in
captivity are trained to fight, and an owner will
occasionally be found to back his ‘ tiger ’ to fight
any snake of his inches in New South Wales.”
And London Christian World (Nov. 7) gravely
announces that a plague of rabbits, four miles
long and as many wide and as close as bunny can
travel, is at present ravaging Australia.
The news lately wired that the Q. Govern-
ment Resident at Thursday Island has discovered
two rivers on the Cape York Peninsula, running
into the Gulf, and named them respectively the
Embley and the Ley, is rather perplexing. It is
rendered more so by the statement that they are
large and navigable for a considerable distance.
The Gulf side of the Peninsula has been traversed
over and over again of late, has been taken up for
cattle runs, and generally become as well-known
as the Sydney Block. Where these two navigable
rivers could have hidden themselves all this time
is a mystery. If Calvert had discovered them, or
even David Lindsay, no one would have wondered,
but Resident Douglas is a man of veracity and
experience.
Meteorologist Wragge is said to be stuck
for storm titles. Apropos of which one of the
most shriekingly funny stories on record comes
from the Tasmanian Telegraph Department. But,
sad to say, it is unprintable.
A very high medical authority says that
Queen Victoria finds increasing difficulty in
respiring, especially when asleep. In Nature’s
craving for oxygen is found the cause of H.M.’s
long and rapid open-carriage drives in all
weathers.
‘ ‘ The dawning of a glorious day of Aus-
tralasian literature is already ruddying the East,
when colonists, their nation-making labors les-
sened, will have time to devote to intellectual
culture some portion of those energies now often
so profitlessly expended amid the storm and stress
of colonial politics.”— Westminster Review.
Dear Bulletin, —The Australian rabbit
can only mount a tree under favorable conditions.
The tree must be either hollow —with an aperture
at the top of the spout, for exit—or else leaning at
a very considerable angle. In the former case, the
animal usually works up with the aid of his back.
Wire-netting being set perpendicularly blocks the
prolific little pest, unless small enough to get
through. Witness the tens of thousands found
dead, at times, along the netting, which has effec-
tually blocked them from water. — Muzzle wood.
Among the convicts still lingering in Wes-
tralia, is an “old hand” whose repeated escapes
from the most closely-barred cages puzzled his
keepers. As a last resource, a specially-constructed
cell of bars was provided for him. “ Now, get out
of that,” said the gaoler grimly, “and you oan
have your liberty.” “Right, Guv’nor,” said the
convict, “ I will call before breakfast to-morrow.”
He kept his word, and got his ticket-of-leave. It
was not till then that he exhibited a tiny saw,
which for years he had carried secreted in his
mouth.
The Hot Wave.
About this season of the year look out for the
hot wave. Every now and then one sweeps over
the country, blistering the face of nature with its
scorching breath. It turns the fields of living
green into shabby patches of dirty brown, dries
up the rippling rills, and drains the life and vigor
from all animate objects.
How tedious and uncomfortable the long hot
days are. The cattle cease browsing and seek
the stream, where, half immersed in the cool
water, they meekly chew their cud ; the house-
dog lies stretched and panting in the shade, and
permits the dusty tramp to approach the door
unheralded; the birds hush their song and hide
in the deep recesses of the woods.
They are fortunate beings, for they may indulge
in the rest and quiet which nature craves. It is
the human beings who suffer most at these periods
of unnatural depression. The system revolts at
physical activity and demands a repose, but the
daily grind must go on. The harvest must be
housed, the wheels of commerce must be kept
turning. From field and shop the commands of
labor are imperative, and household duties cannot
be neglected. Men and women must work,
though the extreme heat makes physical effort a
seeming impossibility. They are periods of great
danger. The system, depleted of strength and
vigor, easily yields to the encroachments of
disease. The slightest irregularities are speedily
transposed into dangerous maladies, and the
necessity of keeping the system regulated and
toned lip during these periods is urgent. To those
who appreciate the situation it is not necessary t©
say now is the time when the use of Warner’s Safe
Cure is found most valuable in maintaining a
regularity in the natural organs, necessary to a
healthy condition, and in giving a .on' and
strength to the system which can be acquired by
no other means. Its combination of system-regu-
lating, blood purifying, and strength-giving pro-
perties is unequalled, as has been proved by its use
by thousands of people in all parts of the civilised
globe.
The following experience, like thousands of
others, testifies to the value of Warner’s Safe Cure.
Mr. Murray L. Allan, Government Officer, of
Goulburn, N.S.W., says: “ I have much pleasure
in lustring witness to the efficacy of Warner’s Safe
Cu e T had been troubled for many years with
congestion of the liver, and I must candidly state
that nothing has ever given me such relief and
built me up to such a degree as this remedy. 1
will always recommend it. I may also state that
those to whom I have commended Warner’s Safe
Cure have derived great benefit therefrom.”

POLITICAL
POINTS
In place of “ Anglo-Australian, absentee-
parasite,” &c., what’s the complaint with “ Ex-
haustralian ” ?
The U.S. Monroe doctrine applies only
to Ameripa. J. Bull’s Monroe doctrine applies to
the whole earth.
Rhodes, in re Boerland, plays the
game of Cavour towards Garibaldi. This is to
disavow the thing, but take advantage of it, if it
gees.
Q. Premier Nelson may not seek re-elec-
tion owing to ill-health. Should he retire, recreant
Philp, the cocksure Tozer, and the smug Barlow
will each struggle desperately for the reins.
The Braddon Government helps along the
good cause of economy by selling - the departmental
waste-paper, old records, blue books, &c., to the
Maoriland paper-mills at £2 a ton. It made <£4o
last year out of this new source of revenue, and is
now known as the “ Waste-paper Ministry.”
Isaac Isaacs, the Vic. Attorney-General, is
strangely anxious to keep Johnny, his brother,
before the world. Lately they were ban-
queted together at Bright, and, as a matter
of course, the reporters of Ike’s speech gave the
brother a word or two of mention. Johnny, as an
M.L.A., is a screaming joke in real life, but his
brainier relative wants him to be taken seriously.
The Supi’eme Com-
Bill, reducing the power " nd
dignity of the Northern
Court, has been a bitter pill
to Townsville.
Just as Yictoria has
built up a big butter export
trade with England, news
comes that Argentina has
started to export on a large
s ::ale to the same -universal
market. And the Argentine,
with low wages, cheap land,
shorter distance from the
British market, and a de-
preciated paper - currency
which makes his sovereign
worth about 60s. for all pur-
poses within the country,
can cut out the Australian
hopelessly, provided he pro-
duces a good article, which
he probably will learn to’ do
some day. It is the old
story —there is no reliable
market except our own. If
the Victorian spreads him-
self to supply his own wants
i i the matter of sugar, and
thus saves the <£500,000 a
year which goes out of the
province to buy that article,
and if he can save the
£ 400,000 a year that has
hitherto been paid for coal
imports, he will do more
reliable good for his province
than if he struggled with the
butter-export trade till the
day of judgment.
The N.S. Wales Leg.
Council made only one
amendment on the Federal
Enabling Bill, its effect
being that the province’s
delegates to the Federal
Convention are not to be paid
as originally intended. Pre-
mier Reid wisely yielded the
point, else Federation, so far
as N.S.W. was concerned,
would probably have got
back to where it started
from. Also, he very un-
wisely announced that some
way would be found for pay-
ing- the delegates after all —
in other words, he announced
that the Government would
find some underhand method
of bursting up the statute.
There is a fine, ruffianly un-
scrupulousness about the
average party Cabinet with
a big party majority behind
it. TJnder the present system
the House can’t seriously in-
terfere with the Govern-
ment’s doings unless by de-
stroying it altogether, and so
long as there is no alter-
native save the not too popu-
lar Lyne, Reid may do almost
anything he pleases. He
must do something desper-
ately bad to make the
Assembly put up Lyne in
his stead, and G.H.R. trades
•n this fact in many ways.
Acting-Justice Cohen’s appointment to a
permanent N.S.W. Supreme Court judgeship may
now be regarded as almost a matter of oertainty.
But why on earth should Mr. Cohen be
appointed while a man of Edmund Barton s
calibre is available ? T s it beoause Mr. Cohen is a
political friend and Barton a political opponent or
the Reid Cabinet? Is the bench of justice to be a
political stamping-ground ?
Dear Bulletin, —Do you notice that Hing-
land has made a sudden rise in the favor of
theatre-audiences here since ’Murka began to
“come it a little too thick” in the Venezuela
matter? Australia’s alleged love for America is
not a very solid sentiment when tested. — Blanker
Grab.
Q. Attorney-General Byrnes, who pro-
mised the electors of Cairns never to desert that
northern constituency as long as it stood by him,
is now advertised as a candidate for North Bris-
bane at the coming elections. The seat-holders at
present are MTlwraith and Kingsbury. Neither
is likely to stand again.
Maoriland now requires foreign bagmen te
pay a license fee of <£so per annum before they are
allowed to pervade-the province with their samples.
As a result a good many Australian and other
drummers have abandoned Maoriland, and the
native drummer finds things looking up. In a
province run on protectionist principles the foreign
bag-person is about the most legitimate object of
taxation that could be discovered.
The S.A. Labor M’sP. who sat in the
expired Assembly have to run the gauntlet of a
plebiscite shortly, when their names will be
coupled with those of eight Labor men recently
chosen. It is regarded as certain that, of the
retiring members, Wood, Hourigan, and M'Gilliv-
ray will be dropped. In S.A. it is much better to
be an M.L.C. —a billet which lasts for nine years,
as against three years in the Assembly.
Item from the Freetrade Border Post
(Albury, N.S.W.): —
A district miller states his intention of importing Cali-
fornian wheat per Port Melbourne, taking it in bond to
Albury, when the duty is removed, as promised by the
Reid Government at the end of the year. He estimates
that he can thus land wheat at Albury at 3s. 7d. to 3s. Bd.
per bushel.
Another joyous prospect for the N.S.W. agricul-
turist.

THE HAWKERS' LICENSING DAY.
"'me Albury Bench seems to have taken up a position in connection with
Assyrian and other foreign hawkers from which it should promptly be shifted
by the authority which makes Benches. The local police objected to the grant-
ing of licenses to some of these aliens, on the ground that many complaints
had been received of the conduct of colored hawkers in terrorising women and
children. Thereupon the police magistrates intimated that henceforward no
licenses would be granted by the Albury Bench to them. It seems to me that
this line of action is as mean and unwarrantable as ever a civilised Government
permitted. It would be as justifiable to refuse ordinary citizens’ rights to Irish-
men or Scotchmen, because a few of their race misbehaved.”— Sydney D.T.
Magistrate : “ How many shillings in a crown ? ”
“Beg pardon
“ How many shillings in a crown ? ”
“ Twelve .”
“ What ship did you come out in ? ”

bluff. Say exactly what you mean. It’s a good deal.
Leave the other fellow to make an ass of himself. If yeu
know anything special about a particular Act, trot it out.
Special knowledge, whether it touches the matter in
hand or doesn’t, always impresses the crowd. Be rather
advocate than judicial-it pays! The public always
knock 50 per cent, off the value of your utterance. Talk
up to the 50 per cent, discount. If you can, go 75—you
are bound to win ! Never injure your chances by show-
ing temper of any kind ! Use always the retort cour-
teous ! The suaviter in modo is the electioneering atti-
tude ; keep the fortiter in re for assured membership.
Never go back on the man who writes your speeches, for
thereby you prepare a back for a whip of scorpions.
Ten probable N.S.W. delegates to the
Federal Convention: Reid, Wise, M‘Millan,
Want, Lyne, Barton, Copeland, Ashton, Ewing,
and the inevitable Parkes. Ten probable Vic-
torian delegates: Turner, Isaacs, Peacock, Best,
Deakin, Shiels, Trenwith, Service, Wrixon, and
Tucker. Ten likely S.A. representatives : King-
ston, Downer, Cordon, Holder, Cockburn, Horn-
burg, Symons, Baker, Gillen, Jenkins. Ten Tas-
manians : Braddon, Clark, Fysh, Moore, Douglas,
Bird, Burgess, Pillinger, and two others who are
so doubtful that they may be anybody. If Wes-
tralia is represented, and her delegates are elected
on anything resembling a liberal suffrage, they
will probably consist of John Forrest and nine
men that have never been heard of before. And
if the Boodle Ministry can work the elections as
it usually does, Queensland’s 10 should be Nelson,
Tozer, Barlow, Byrnes, Drake, Glassey, Powers,
Philp, MTlwraitn’s ghost, and either Morehead
or Beelzebub for last place.
When feeble
old John M‘ln-
tyre started his
Vic. village set-
tlement scheme,
he dumped down
one of his biggest
colonies in the
middle of a valu-
able State forest.
The settlers pot-
tered feebly at
the roots of the
gigantic gums,
and after much
time and much
expenditure of
public money,
cleared a lot of
ground, and
burnt much valu-
able timber. The
ground, it is now
found, will grow
nothing worth
speaking of but
timber, so the
settlers are drift-
ing away, and
tiie money paid
them by the State
is lost, and the
area they cleared
will have to be
replanted with
trees to make it
of any value.
And meanwhile
the unspeakable
old John wants
to get back into
office to save his
bleeding country
once more, and
his pride in his
village settlement
scheme breaks
out with a powerful Scotch accent at every oppor-
tunity.
Queensland, which is already overrun with
unemployed, is now dreaming about a scheme for
inducing shipping go’s to bring out poverty-
stricken immigrants at £l2 a head, the state sup-
plementing this with a grant of £2 per head.
Also it is proposed to send a lecturer to England
with lying statistics and magic-lantern slides, in
order to beguile the British Hodge to the land of
bankruptcy, sun-glare, Kanakas, crocodiles, and
general rottenness.
The Age : “If ex-Premier Parkes had re-
ceived a testimonial from the public, no word
would probably have been uttered against him.
But, as it is, the representatives of the N.S.W.
Eabor-party have raised their voices in protest;
and, if the grant is carried over their heads by
mere force of numbers, it will be robbed of all its
value from a national point of view. If the ex-
Premier consulted his own reputation, he would
decline any grant of public money that any section
of the taxpayers objected to, and leave it to his
personal friends and sympathisers to fill up the
void. A donation to which half the donors are
compelled to contribute against their will is a
theft, and not a gift at all.”
Trenwith (Yic, M.L.A.) on man’s chival-
rous treatment of woman
I believe we have set up a certain standard of etiquette
that makes the decently-inclined of us lift our hats when
we meet a lady in the street whom we know, which
makes us get up in order that a lady may occupy a seat,
and which makes us rob women of half their wages when
we employ them. I would ask honorable members not
to forget, when we are remembering the good things
which we do for women, that when we employ them in
almost any capacity we rob them of half the wages that
they ought to get. Man has “ worshipped ” women, to
use the language of the honorable member for Mel-
bourne, by oppressing them during all ages. The pro-
posal to give them equal power with man is one means
that will be used as a lever to elevate them from the
position of social and economical degradation into which
they have been driven.
The Age also was very much hurt by
M.L.A. Prendergast’s declaration that a little
repudiation by Australia of the interest due to the
British bondholder would do no harm at the
present time. The Age is a bold, bad bi-metallist,
which says that the appreciation of gold has
doubled the burden of interest to the prejudice of
Australia, that one sovereign now is worth what
two sovereigns were 22 years ago, and that a
return to a fixed legalised ratio between gold and
silver is needed to adjust matters. Prendergast
accepted the Age premises that the official stan-
dard of value had swollen in a wicked, hurtful
way for the benefit of creditor nations —but Pren-
dergast would not wait for the long-deferred
remedy. He proposed a short cut to exactly the
same end, and the Age called him a wicked
repudiationist
In Maoriland, if a “ prohibited person ” is
found in an hotel he may be fined £5 ; the hotel-
keeper may be fined £5 for allowing him to be
there; and any person who accompanied him
when he went in, or accompanied him after he
was in, or incited him to go in, or incited him to
drink, or directly or indii-ectly helped, or incited,
or encouraged him to obtain drink, may be fined
£lO. The word “accompany” is so large and
general that, under this supremely silly law, it
isn t safe to go into a Maoriland hotel alongside
anybody, or directly in front of or directly behind
anybody ; and it is highly dangerous to tell any
casual stranger, inside or outside, that it is a hot
day, lest he be a prohibited person, and the
remark reminds him of his thirst, and thereby
‘ * indirectly incites ” him.
Smith was an Australian politicians’
“ghost,” a clever pressman who managed to
quarrel with every political party. But he had
gone away, left the country —was in hospital, some
thought. A candidate, addressing the electors,
said : “ I could never think of associating myself
politically with such men as Mr. Smith. ” Smith’s
voice (from body of hall) : “ Did I not write your
political address for Frog Flat last year?” The
candidate was short-sighted. Peering down
among the upturned faces, he stammered : “ Well
—ahem—l ” “Did lor did I not?” roared
Smith. “ Well—ahem—really, gentlemen—l ”
“Did I write your speech?” again demanded
HIS OTHER HALF.
(Talking pair in background.)
SHE: “See the newly-wedded couple. They say he married beneath hiw"
HE: “Rather!”
Smith. “ You did,” softly ejaculated the candi-
date as he collapsed amid the jeers of the citizens.
It wasn’t Smith after all, but a man with a voice
like Smith’s, put up by the opposition purely on
the off-chance.
The wobblesome Sydney D.T. now says
that the “accuracy of Judge Windeyer’s decision
in the Dean trial was most amply vindicated by
subsequent events ; ” also, that “ Judge Windeyer
has the satisfaction of not closing his career until
it has been demonstrated that, whether he com-
mitted an error or not in his methods in that
matter, he did no injustice.” Which would be
very good soft-sawder as applied to Judge Lynch,
but surely not as regards Judge Windeyer, who is
an official of an ostensibly civilised community.
As to the argument of “ subsequent events ” vindi-
cating illogical and tyrannous judicial actions,
just apply it to the Mount Rennie case, presided
over by the same Judge Windeyer, where four
boys were hanged, mainly on the evidence of two
men claimed by the Crown to be decent citizens,
but proved by “ subsequent events ” (within a
month and 18 months respectively) to be a forger
and an arsonist. It is the privilege of the Deity
alone to be vindicated by “subsequent events.”
Byrne, Q.C., whom “Tom” Slattery has
retained to lead the Privy Council appeal on the
N.S.W. Payment of Members difficulty, is author
of probably the most useful Act passed by British
Parliament last session. The Act, which came into
force on Ist inst. and is entitled The Summary
Jurisdiction (Married Woman) Act ordains that
where a husband wilfully refuses or neglects to
provide his wife with reasonable maintenance she
can leave him and sue for a weekly payment of
not more than £2. This sum she can obtain in
the lower court through any magistrate; if she
wants more than £2 she will have to apply to the
Divorce Court. The Act also provides that where
a woman “ goes wrong ” through the fault of her
husband that fact will not disentitle her to claim
the maintenance specified. Tire first intention of
the Act was to give women the pecuniary benefits
of the Divorce Court without the costly litigation
whiclr divorce proceedings entail, but the author
has included principles which carry the rights of
women much farther than the courts have hitherto
been willing to sanction. Mr. Byrne received the
support of the Radical members, and notwith-
standing the startling features of his measure he
carried it through with comparative ease. If he
succeeds as well with the N.S.W. business he has
taken in hand, and he is understood to express
confidence in his ability to do so, Premier Reid
and the Constitution will have another -Wrestle in
the open.

Report of the Trustees of the Sydney Cricket Ground .
In publishing the attached balance-sheet for the
year ending the 30th September last, being the
20th year of the existence of the Sydney Cricket
Ground, the Trustees desire to lay before the
public a brief history of the ground from the
beginning of the Trust.
The Trustees were appointed in January, 1876.
At that time the ground, with the exception of a
small area on the western side, close to the present
entrance to the grand-stand, was as nature had
formed it. A hill on the eastern side, where the
new stand has recently been erected, extended to
the centre of the playing ground where match -
wickets are now pitched. There was a water-course
at the foot of it, by which flood waters from the
southern slope of Paddington and the Rifle Range
found their way to a water-hole on the southern
end of the ground, and thence to the Botany
dams, from which the city received the water-
supply. At the Northern end, the site of the pre-
sent tennis-courts, there was a long, shallow
lagoon, much frequented by wild fowl during the
winter months.
Recognising that the want of a Cricket-ground
had been a long-felt one, the work of alteration
and improvement was undertaken with a will.
The funds of the Cricket Association, £750, were
generously handed over by that body to the
Trustees to assist them in carrying on the work,
and the Government of the day obtained a vote of
£5OO towards the cost of fencing and making
approaches from the Randwick-road. These sums,
however, formed But a small portion of the cost of
bringing the ground from its original condition to
the state in which it appeared when the first Aus-
tralian Eleven returned from England in Novem-
ber, 1878.
The Trustees had first on their own personal
account provided funds by making advances and
procuring credits to the extent of ,£2OOO. Sub-
sequently, assisted by Mr. F. H. Dangar, they
procured a credit of another £2OOO, the guarantors
being indemnified by Messrs. M. H. Stephen,
Stephen Campbell Brown, Arthur Docker, John
M. Gibson, W. C. Goddard, and the late William
Clarke.
From the beginning of the season 1877-8 the
Trustees have been assisted in financing and
managing the ground by a committee selected
from the representatives of the Cricket Clubs then
forming the N.S.W. Cricket Association —Mr.
Gibson, Mr. Goddard, Mr. Docker, Mr. Teece,
Mr. W. B. Walford, and Mr. Beal—these gentle-
men (excepting Mr. Walford deceased, and Mr.
Teece, who is now a trustee), with Mr. Faithfull,
Mr. Bray, and Mr. Portus, forming the Ground
Committee of to-day. The late Mr. W. B. Wal-
ford, up to the time of his death, was honorary
Treasurer to the Trustees as well as honorary Trea-
surer to the Cricket Association. That gentleman
was succeeded by Mr. Teece, and the connection
between the Trustees and the Cricket Association
continued until 1884, when the Association decided
to take control of its own financial arrangements.
Prior to this, the Trustees were ex officio members
of the Committee of the Association. Now, only
one of them holds a seat on that body by virtue of
his office, just as the Trustee of the Domain
Ground holds his seat at the present time.
The Trustees have, since the Association under-
took the management of its finances, received
from Intercolonial and other cricket matches,
managed by the Cricket Association, the sum of
£2198 10s. 2d., the Association receiving £10,557
2s. 7d. clear of all expenses in connection with the
matches, hut from this sum the expenses of teams
visiting other colonies had to be met.
Meetings of the Ground Committee are held on
alternate Thursdays, at which generally a Trustee
attends, when all matters in connection with the
ground are considered and arranged.
Besides the valuable services of the Ground
Committee, the Trustees have had very great help
from the Mayors of the City (beginning with the
late Mr. James, Merriman), Aldermen, Town
Clerks, Mr. R. Seymour, and the Principal
Officers of the Corporation. Without the help
received from this quarter, the Trustees would
have been obliged to lay out large sums of money
in procuring material for forming the embank-
ments which afford to thousands of people who
patronise the outer portion of the ground a good
view of what takes place within the arena. While
thanking their municipal friends, the Trustees are
mindful of the public, from whom the greatest
assistance has come. They, by their generous
support, have enabled the Trustees and the Ground
Commitee to form a perfect ground, equal, if not
superior in its appointments and surroundings, to
any in the world.
While thus acknowledging the public patronage
it is desirable to point out that the Trustees have
not received the whole of the gate-receipts. The
Trustees’ share of these receipts has but seldom
exceeded 20 per cent., the balance going into the
hands of those bodies controlling and managing
the various sports which take place on the ground.
During the 20 years of the existence of the grounds,
the receipts from all sources have been as
follows :
The amounts received by the various bodies who
have engaged th i ground are not given here, b.u
some idea of the sum th ■/ would total may be
obtained by multiplying the amounts under th '
headings of erica ‘t-mitches and sports by 4,
Thus, while the Trustees have received £33,581
6s. Bd. in percentage on gate receipts from Cric cet,
Football and other sports, the Association ■.
Unions, Clubs, and Leagues conducting them hav >
had approximately £L34,0(44. From this sum tli •
bodies in question have, of course, had to defray
the whole of the expenses in connection with th ■
various events conducted by them, includ,ap-
prizes, wages, and expenses of gatemen, &e.
The statement of the 20 years’ receipts and e
penditure has been compiled from the yearly-
balance-sheets, which, after having been duly
audited by well-known and qualified accountants,
have been periodically published in the Sydney
papers.
The past season has been by far the most profit-
able that the Trustees have had, the visit of th •
English team being mainly accountable for it
Never has there been greater interest taken in
Cricket matches in the colonies than in those
played by Mr. Stoddart’s team during the pist
season.
Besides the improvements already on the ground
and in course of erection, the Trustees are h v »g
plans prepared for a new Ladies’ Pavilion < n th ■
site of the old one between the Members’ Pavilion
and the Grand Stand. It will have a frontage o
125 ft. and stand back 44ft. from the p’aying
ground. There will be two galleries, a lower and
upper, each having separate refreshment and retir-
ing rooms. This structure with its terraced front
will give seating accommodation for at least 2004
persons. Accommodation for the Press will b ■
provided almost in a line with the wickets at th ‘
Northern end of the ground.
The Trustees have also in view the extension of
shelter accommodation for the patrons of the
outer portion of the ground by adding a cantilever
to the present eastern stand and erecting another
stand on the top of the south-eastern embankment.
For the season 1877-8 the members’ list numbered
418 ; for the past season it numbered 2401. Whilst
this increase is gratifying it is to be regretted that
the members are far below the members’ roll of
the Melbourne Ground. The annual subscription
to both grounds is the same, and whilst the mem-
bers’ entrance-fee to the Sydney Ground is One
Guinea, it is Three Guineas to the Melbourne
Ground. For the past season the income of the
Melbourne Cricket Club from members was up-
wards of ,£OOOO, whilst the income of the Sydney
ground from the same source was, as the balance
sheet will show, £3632 Bs, 6d.
During the year Mr. Philip Sheridan, who has
filled the position of Managing-Trustee for nearly
20 years, resigned from the trust, and Mr. Richa-d
Teece was appointed a T ustee in his place. Tu •
Trustees desire to place or record their deep sense
of the valuable services gratuitously rendered by
Mr. Sheridan ; it being principally owing to his
zeal that the ground is in its present satisfactory-
position.
In concluding this combination of history and
report, the Trustees desire to offer their thanks to
the press of the city for the generous notices of
the ground and the sports that have taken place
there. The desire of the Trustees has been to
make the ground popular, and in this respe it the
press has materially aided.

[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
OUR CO-OPERATIVE GROUP
(Told by a Member.)
vVe was growing sick of loafing, we was tired of
Brisbane Soup,
So we up and started forming a Co-operative
(Iroup—
Barman Bill and Mick the Lumper, Plumber
Brown and Ikey Jones,
Whose occupation previously was chiefly breaking
stones.
There was Thomas Wall, confectioner, and Smith
who painted signs,
Young Jenkins from the grocer’s store, and Meggs
who mended blinds;
O’Shea the long compositor, M‘Quilk the mason
short,
With the sundry wives and kiddies which they
never could support.
There was Bloggs, the carpenter, who talked of
cows and country air,
And Brice, a softy gentleman who paid for every
share ;
And Mitchins with the fruitful wife who on him
had bestowed
A score of little Mitch ins, and another on the
road.
From a glance at the foregoing ’tivill be easy, sir,
to see
How splendid were the prospects of our new com-
munity,
For our members represented every calling out of
hand,
Except the class who cultivate and dwell upon the
land.
They gave us for a settlement a strip of trees and
stone
(Tho’ had it been Toowoomba loam we never
should have known) ;
But whilst we had a pound or two and Govern-
ment supply
It may be that for half-a-week we got on pretty
spry.
As the journey up was jolty and our nerves not of
the best,
’Twas agreed that work be started by a week of
perfect rest,
So we lay about a-smoking and a-lounging in the
sun,
And ate up all the women cooked as soon as it
was done.
Our Secret’ry, one Thomas Wall, accustomed to
the pen,
And Barman Bill and Lumped Mick were chief
committee-men ;
And Brice, the gent as first financed our daring
enterprise,
He drove the cows up mornings when too damp
for us to rise.
It appears the chief advantage of a Group for
mutual toil
Is that nineteen men can go to sleep whilst One
man tills the soil;
And when a member speaks about the fence that
should be run,
The scorn that greets him makes him add, “ I only
spoke in fun.”
Our Secretary did not toil. He had a playful
way—
He k opt a-granting to hisself a public holiday ;
And took our only cart and horse to reach the
nearest pub.,
Rem irking “ that he needed strength and had to
go for grub.”
Wh' st the Group was still discussing all the
features of his sin,
Bill and Mick, the chief committee, further
troubles did begin—
They “planted” the tobacco, docked our flour
with ribald jokes,
Whilst their wives (on double rations) called us,
“Them there vulgar blokes.”
And when the cheque for bullocks came—we
guessed it from the first —
They never bought no beasts to kill—but went
upon the burst.
And it turned out subsequent their bills for whisky
all were sent
As vouchers for potatoes to a guileless Guving-
ment.
’Twas only human nature that the work came to
a stop :
We was looking for the whisky—we had never had
a drop ;
When the Secret’ry returned to camp and turned
out Tim M'Phayre,
Remarking “he must have that hut as a stable
for his mare. ”
Whilst we was gathered round MThayre and
nearly come to blows,
Up yonder in the milking-yard another row arose,
It seemed that Mrs. Ann O’Shea and Mrs. Jane
M‘Quilk
Had driven milkman Brice away and taken all the
milk.
And milkman Brice, he found himself unable to
pursue—
Last night he borrowed of an axe and chopped his
toe in two —
But Mrs. Mitchins and the kids amid the general
fray
Got access to the ration-hut and took the “ junk ”
away.
We have written to the Guvingment to tell of our
success,
And asked for cheques to go away, and also for
“redress”;
And the only one who doesn’t talk of damages and
law
Is Brice, the softy gentleman, who’s dying of
lock-jaw.

GEO. ESSEX EVANS.
Dear Bulletin. —Re the Wilson divorce-
case (Melb.), you say “the law arrived at one
its most remarkable decisions. ... It decided
that because both of them (husband and wife)
were entitled to a divorce neither of them ought
to have it. ” A commentator who applies the term
“remarkable” to that Wilson decision, and sup-
pose 3 that he has discovered anew legal absurdity’
must b 9 very young indeed. [Nothing was said
about a new absurdity.—Ko. B.] Tne revolting
doctrine that misconduct puts both p etitioner and
respondent out of court, and draws their matri-
monial tie tighter than other people’s, avas
formulated long before The Bulletin was born,
and has been thundered from the Bench by
learned moralists Lord forgive them !—ever
since. It was remarkable once upon a time. It s
a chestnut now.— Court Crier.

Dear Bulletin, — Re the “stoicism” of
Australians. I was in work ; my mate was not.
lie went to another township about 50 miles off to
look for work got drunk, and took a dose of
nitric acid. \\ hen I heard of it T boarded the
tram, arrived at 10 p.m. that night, swallowed
half a tumbler of whisky, and rushed to the hos-
pital. 1 approached the bed with tears in my
eyes, and, leaning over him, said, “Great
Heavens, old man, what did you do this for? ” He
looked at me calmly for three or four seconds,
then, wiping his swollen mouth, remarked—
You ve been drinking !”—H.Y.
Dear Bulletin, —A recent correspondent
asks what good plain rabbit-proof netted fences
u r< m: r 1S tru ® that ra hbits have acquired the
nabit of tree-climbing? First, though rabbits do
climb trees, if there are any forks about, they
seem to have a knack of getting their heads
caught—as the descent is being made, pro-
/r° Wlt}l wire-netting. Thousands of
labbits attempt to climb the fences round the far
western dams, but, unfortunately for themselves
too soon conclude that they are'at the top, push
them heads m, and so get caught. More carcases
are to be seen hanging near the top than else-
where. Apparently there is a difficulty about the
aescent when the top is reached, yet a few un-
doubtedly do scale 3ft. Gin. fences, though it is
only by rare accident. A much greater number
dash through the netting; the regulation ISin.
gauge is certainly ineffective. But, anyhow,
rabbit-proof fencing out west in N.S.W. is a
rarity, though hundreds of miles of what is thus
described have been built. The fence offers some
resistance to sand ; and a decent bush sandstorm
will cover the top wire in an hour or
two, so that the rabbits can go over with
ease, or in far less time will eddy out
| enough of the fence to give passage under-
neath. It is one thing to keep the fence round a
20-acre lucerne paddock rabbit-proof, and quite
another to keep rabbit-proof a 20-mile fence that
passes over sand-hills and across water-courses. It
is also one thing ; to risk putting up the lucerne
paddock fence, and another thing to risk putting
up the 20-mile fence round the l-sheep-to-10-acres-
paddoek where you are pretty certain the posts
will be eaten away inside five years. But the men
of the Eastern and Central divisions don’t seem
to think of these differences when they set them-
selves cheerfully to dismiss the rabbit problem.—
Fencer.
Dear Bulletin, — Re leucoderma, I have
seen amongst the Dyaks occasional individuals
with reddish hair, greyish eyes, and skin light
enough to show a liberal freckling. There was no
affinity to the albinic type, and, as the men were
unquestionably full-blooded Dyaks, I was obliged
to hypothesise some such reversionary peculiarity
as that by which, in breeding, for instance, from
white poodles, there may come to hand at any
time a perfectly black puppy or a brown or both.

SPORTING NOTIONS.
Aided by a wicket which “ did a bit,” N.S.W.
downed S. Aus. for 134 runs in the second innings, and
won the match by an innings and 34 runs. It was hard
for Giffen and co., especially as a stronger N.S.W. team
had beaten Bananaland by only nine wickets, and the same
team had beaten Vic. by only 123 runs.
Borne good fielding was done in the match.
Reedman caught four Sydneyites out in the first innings,
one of whom was the top-notcher, Donnan. In S. Aus.
second innings, MTxibbin caught three men out and
bagged four wickets to his own cheek.
Howell did most of the destruction in S. Aus.
second innings, getting five for 49, as against M’Kibbin’s
four for 73. Nevertheless, MTxibbin, for the trip, comes
out with 20 at 17 ’7 each, while Howell got 13 for 19T each.
Donnan’s batting average for the trip is 99’G6 ;
the N.S.W. team’s batting average is 34'3.
Howell got Lyons again in the second innings ;
and MTxibbin got G. Giffen each time. Now that llowell
knows Lyons’ weak spot, the swiper may become as easy
a gilt to him every time as he used to be for Peel in Eng-
land, or as G. Giffen used to be for Richardson.
The feature of the N.S.W. cricket trip was the
batting of Donnan. Successive scores of 163, 46, and 93
against the best Vic. and S.A. talent are champion’s form.
Thebigpoints of the S.A. match were the batting
of Donnan and the bowling of Howell. Howell bowled 44
overs, 17 maidens, for 88 runs and 8 wickets; MTxibbin
sent down 41 overs, 9 maidens, for 134 runs and 8 wickets.
Sydney Cricket-ground may shake hands with
itself over the recent victories. For, this being the first
time in eight years that N.S.W. has beaten Vic. in Melb.,
and the first for five that she has beaten S. Aus. in
Adelaide, public interest will get nearer enthusiasm-point
in interprovincial matches than formerly.
* * * *
After three hollow wins at Christchurch, Wel-
lington and Dunedin, the N.S.W. cricket team got an
unlooked-ior check when it met the All-Maoriland team
in the first trial match, losing by 142 runs. M.L. made
a much better stand in the second innings (254) than
anticipated, and on Fisher taking 5 wickets for 20 and
Robertson 3 for 44, the rout of the visitors was practically
complete. Callaway took 7 M.L. wickets in the first and
8 in the second innings.
* * * *
Will G. Giffen never learn to change his own
cowling? Three wickets for 140 runs almost equal to
the whole S.A. first-innings score of 152. “ Garrett twice
lifted the mighty Giffen over the leg-chains !” It should
be: “Giffen kept himself on so long, and bowled such
rubbish, that even the venerable Garrett resented it, and
hit two extra soft ones clean out of the ground. Giffen
thereupon changed the bowling at the other end.”
Donnan top score again with 93 in the first
innings. Donnan, going in first, has done big things this
season —against Btnianaland, 40 and 30 (not out); against
Vic., 160 and 46 ; now 93 against S.A.

“ Billy ” Bruce, most popular and unassuming
of Australian ci icx -iers, will probably stand out of the
team visiting England, as his law-practice is more lucra-
tive now than cricket, and to go Ome would simply mean
losing it all. So Bruce will probably lay to his book.

Dear Bulletin, —“ In ” couples Eady with
Coningham tor a place in next Australian Eleven. Now,
beyond once making a first-rate score in Hobart against a
second-rate team from Victoria, what has Eady ever done
to be in the same street with Coningham V Giffen, it is
true, once sent him a badly-worded congratulatory mes-
sage by cable ; but a cabled certificate of merit from the
Great Giffen, even if it were in good form, would not keep
a batsman’s wicket up against English bowlers. In Tas.
N. v. S. match, just played, Rady's bowling was com-
pletely collared by second-class batsmen, while neither
his batting nor his fielding was up to even Tas. high-
w iter mark. Eady, it is said, could be improved. Then
why not improve him first and pick him afterwards ?
Yours, &c., Theta.

The wail of discontent is already heard over the
proposal to have o ily 6d. gates at Manchester and Ixen-

construction and calibre of the team are secondary
matters.

Samples of daily-paper cricket-report: “M‘lvib-

This after MTxibbin got four wickets for 61 as against
S.A. Jones’ seven for 103. And Jones bowled on a better
wicket and against a team which made 320 runs, while
S.A. scored 152. Later we’ll get it: “The graceful
Howell, having bared his magic arm, came with willowy
movements and smiling mien to the bowling-crease, and
delivered his fatally subtle ball; the astonished wicket
fell.”
» * * *
The second innings of N.S.W. against Victoria
and the first against S.A. were remarkable for the amount
of life displayed by the last joint of the tail. Garrett
made 70 against Vic. and 61 against S.AII and Kelly put
up 58 against Vic., 33 against S.A^
N.S.W., having the advantage right through,
did no more than a fair thing in beating Vic. by 123 runs.

Sydney Cricket Ground trustees report a most
successful year to Sept. 30. Receipts were £10,139, and
after paying off £l5OO debentures the expenditure leaves
£lll9 to carry forward. The English Eleven’s visit
brought the trustees £3629 in ground rent and profit.
Only one thing is certain re the next Australian
Eleven. The selection committee will be more generally
and violently abused than any previous choosers of a
team.
* * * *
The cricket-writers who gushed over Albert
Trott’s achievements against Stoddart’s weather-beaten
crew, at Adelaide, are looking very foolish now.
* * • *
Had Tom Garrett’s batting in the second innings
of N.S.W. v. Vic. been performed by ’Enry Parkes it could
hardly have excited more comment on the batsman’s
age. Hearing the remarks of the crowd, and reading the
Melbourne newspapers next day, one could have supposed
“old Tom” to be about 94 next birthday. Garrett is
sixteen years younger than Grace in first-class cricket
experience, and would doubtless live through another
Australian Eleven tour with more credit to his country
than several of the rapidly-deteriorating boys who will go
’Ome next March. Re “veteran” cricketers, there is
some talk of restoring Barlow to the Lancashire County
eleven, and Barlow, The Bulletin fancies, is nearly old
enough to be Garrett’s father.

“I am the biggest hitter on earth. I can drive

no living man can bowl me. I play for the public. I

Th.y are bothering me to go home next year, but 1 won’t

country, 1 know—the team will be a failure without me.
I have spanned the universe several times. I have ”
And so on. Now, who is he ?
* * * *
There was a bicycle race-meeting at Melbourne
Cricket Club ground on New Year’s Day. The somewhat
monotonous announcement that “ all the champions ”
would appear drew an £875 crowd of holiday innocents,
who came fully prepared to see “all the champions”
struggle for supremacy and “smash records” it possible.
The weather was favorable for glorious bike d nigs. A
couple of liberal championship prizes might have given
the public something like the fun they had expected to
get tor their money'.
Nominally a meeting promoted by the Melb.
Bicycle Club in the interests of sport, this was, in truth,
a money-grabbing show fixed up by the M.8.C., the
M.C.C. and Zimmerman, the profits being “ wi.reked ” by
those three institutions. £2O/ was the amount, recklessly'
lavished upon sport, and £668 (less modest exes.)
represented the profit when all was over. A good
day - ’s work for the showmen a bad day’s sport
for the public. Zimmerman, without doubt, proved
fully satisfactory as far as he went. No bicycle rider
could be more sick than the Murkan looked on Jan. Ist,
with his drawn, pasty face, and a silk-handkerchief tied
round his long neck. His appearance was that of a
“goner,” as far as his old championship ability is con-
cerned. Zim. came out for his heat in the 2-mile Brassey
Stakes (a handicap which absorbed more than hall the
total amount of prize-money invested) and made a
decent pretence of being on ttie job. The heat was won
in 4min. 58sec., and yet it was too fast for the great Zim.
and the renowned Parsons, who gracefully retired before
the finish. They were understood to be reset\ ing them-
selves for classic events.
Three of the advertised champions didn’t show
up for the principal handicap, or anything else. Pither
couldn t ride on account of a mishap ; Martin was going for
bigger heansat Bein'i and Don Walker also stayed away',
because, perhaps, hem magement’s prizes didn’t make it
worth his while to .... .-here. Bellow, of Vic., captured
the Brassey Stakes final, with the hard-working Italian,
Porta, second, to the regret of everybody who appreciated
his plucky - try to win outright, and his bad luck in
getting blocked by some of the local candidates.
Zimmerman’s second appearance occurred in his
heat for a One Mile Invitation Scratch Race. Prizes of
£2O, £7, and £3 were the temptation offered to contest-
ants in this high-sounding affair, consequently' champions
didn't make a uig muster. Two starters for Zim. s heat.
They' were both bound to get places in the final, so their
time, 2min. 47sec., for the mile, w 7 as rather kind Under
the circumstances. They' might have “ walked over ”in
a leisurely manner. Ten men in all rode for three heats
of the 0.M.1.5.R., and Zim. won the final from Harris,
who beat Parsons for the £4 difference between second
and third moneys. The American champion beat the
English ditto in 2min. 36sec., and this was the sort of
stuff that 15,000 people had paid to gaze upon. They saw
no more of Zim. The International Five Mile Scratch
Race knew him not. Alas ! it is probable that five-mile
races are things of Zim. s past. At six-and-twenty years
of age he is rapidly growing old, in the present writer’s
opinion.
This International Contest was a medley of
pacemakers and bogus starters. Three out of six starters
wheeled off the track in the second lap. The remaining
three had each of them a tandem or triplet to urge them
on their wild careers. Finally', Harris won in 12min.
27sec., nearly overlapping Parsons. The other man, Car-
penter, earned his £3 for third place at a respectful dis-
tance in the rear. Parsons lolled over his bike in an
apparently fainting condition when Harris seemed to have
him beaten, and would have retired, but the crowd
groaned at their ex-idol, whereupon he shook off some of
his faintness and started going again.
It is hard to say whether Parsons becomes faint
when he is collared, or is collared when he becomes faint.
Anyway, the two circumstances happen simultaneously
in the Vic. champion’s case. Martin outrode him for a
mile race at the “Austral” meeting on the M.C.C.
ground, and he reeled in the saddle. Harris ran away
from Parsons in a five-mile race, and again the beaten
man began to reel.
Parsons, indeed, took his licking at the hands,
or feet, of Harris in the five-mile race with very poor
grace, and went off the picture of disconsolate disgust,
whilst his fickle admirers swarmed about the Britisher,
who lay all of a heap on the grass, and needed much
fanning and pumping before he could be dragged in.
Harris exhausted himself endeavoring to lap the Vic.
champion, which he was within an ace of doing.
A. W. Hill, The Bulletin’s fancy for the Aus-
tral, annexed a second-class mile handicap at the M.B.C.
holiday meeting, last week, in fair style and time. In his
heat for the two-mile Brassey Stakes, however, he rode
with very little dash and judgment, and was beaten out
of a place. Kellow won the £lOO prize with his head
rather than his legs, whilst Porta lost it in the same way.
The present resurrection of Melb. bike-racing
will not be for long unless a strong club is formed to
supersede the rival reigning powers. The M.B.C. has no
sporting bottom. It is represented by two or three
billiard-tables, and refreshment accommodation on the
third floor of a Collins-street building, and is mainly a
place of evening call for young bikers who would be much
better in bed. The club (which compounded with its
creditors for seven “ bob ” in the £ a couple of years ago)
works up a big summer meeting, at which its ardent
disciples ride for about 40 per cent, of the profits when
times are good, and have the satisfaction of seeing
“ foreigners ” capture the bulk of that. Anyway,
the M.B.C. spends a lot more money in organisa-
tion, &c., than it provides for the encouragement
of honest bike-racing, and under its auspices the
“ sport ” is resuming the old stink which made the public
so very sick in days of y'ore. The League of Wheelmen
may be a well-meaning matter, but it isn’t a sporting
institution, nor does the blessed league appear to have the
slightest purifying influence. If the public are to go on
paying their halfcrowns to look at these bits of boys
riding round a tiack, a solid bicycle club will be necessary,
not only for the improvement of prizes, but as some
guarantee of decent racing-a club with power to
punish cronk performers, and sweeten the atmosphere,
and, also, with capital enough to form its own racecourse.
* * * *
We may discover presently that cycling is the
one athletic sport at which a good little man is actually
better than a good big ’un. Although Zim., the great
original champion, is a six-footer, diminutive riders pro-
mise to star in the future. Parsons is only a bantam
(sft. s|in.) anyway, and Michael, the flying Welshman of
the moment, stands sft. half a foot shorter than the
average English sassiety girl. This would be very strong
evidence in favor of the small-champion theory, but for
the fact that tall, heavy men rarely rode bikes in the pre-
“ safety ” days, and are only now beginning to enter the
arena.
* * * *
American makers in 1895 put on the market
355,000 cycles. Estimated output for ’96 about 700,000.
* * * *
Before the five-mile event the crowd were bar
racking Harris, telling him to “ save his wind,” &c., while
Parsons was cheered on to go and take “ his gift.” But
as soon as thr Australian got “ done,” the barrackers
started to tell ,ne another that “they knew he’d be done
as soon as he met a man who could get on to the hind
wheel of the triplet before him.”
* * * *
American definition of an amateur: “ A man
who never has, never will, and never can win a race.”

After the recent eyelids’ church-service at South
Yarra the wheelmen found several machines, including a
tandem, with pin-holes in the tyres and all toe wind out.

Claims for the glory of recognition as the oldest
Australian cyclist roll in fast. E. S. Walter, of Albury,
and Prof. Kernot, of Melbourne, rode machines in 1869,
while Norman Selfe, of Sydney, claims to have made and
ridden a bicycle in ’6B. Another claimant is Alfred
Doubleday, a Melb. coachbuilder, who states that he
made and rode down Collins-street on a two-wheeled
bone-shaker “in the early sixties.” Prior to these dates
the four-wheeled velocipede had been the vogue.
* * * *
The Sydney League of Wheelmen should take
care not to kill the goose that 1 ays the golden eggs. Some
prominent League men, several of whom want to get into
Parliament on bikes, call upon Australian wheelmen at
large to form a colossal league and astonish the earth.
Better stay at home than bother about £309 a year. The
League made 1 1800 out of the last two Sydney meetings,
and has never been able to get its hat on since.

Sample of cycle report: Harris, the Englishman,
was beaten by Zimmerman in the Melb. Bicycle Club’s
mile scratch race. Harris was unwell (especially after the
race ; this fact not mentioned). Again, same day, Harris
beat Parsons in the Five-Mile Race. Parsons was suffer-
ingfrom influenza (caught it riding five miles behind
Harris symptoms not manifest till after the race). Zim-
merman didn’t compete in the five miles ; his doctor said
lie was too ill to ride. (Fact is, bicycle had been left in a
draught and had caught a bad cold). Give us a healthy
cyclist, somebody.
Yes, the cycling firms should advertise :
“ Wanted, a first-class rider who will not contract
dysentery, or marriage, or influenza just prior to a big
race.”

Maclnnes, a South Melb. boy, seems to be a
Zimmerman in embryo—long and slim and a speedy
sprinter. He is only 17, but in the Brassey Stakes on
New Year’s Day he romped away from many an old racer,
and won his heat sitting up.
* • * •
Th ings have been going so badly in connection
with the formation of the Nimrod-Zimmerman Co. that
Zimmerman was cabled for the other day, and will pro-
bably cut his Australian tour short to return.

Zim. settled his little money difference with the
Melb. B.C. and took a third of the New Year’s gate—
about £3OO.
DICK SWIVELLED UP TO DATE.
COLLIE: “ Why were you walking on the roof
this morning? ”
CHOLLIE (who has a creditor in every street ):
“ It's the only way that I can get down
town safely , don't cherknow .”
The sturdy Leicester boy, Harris, is a prime
favorite with the Melb. crowd, chiefly because when fit he
goes for all he is worth. There is nothing suspicious
about his neat pedalling, and when he took the froth off
Parsons’ cup of glory on New Year’s Day, the leather-
lunged mob couldn’t yell loud enough with pleasure. One
elderly gent, was so overcome that he threw his arms
round the Polytechnic rider’s neck and kissed him fer-
vently on each cheek with a sonorous smack.

How does it sound now? “ I have been racing
since ’B7, and in ’94 I won 101 scratch races out of 104.
He spoke cautiously of the Australian riders.” Early
press interview with Zim. And in ’95, just after all these
brilliant successes, to be successively downed by Parsons,
Pither, and Walker—men unknown to the world !

Quiver’s victory in Sydney Tattersall’s Cup
stamps her as a weight-carrying stayer, but it doesn’t free
her reputation from the stigma of being an in-and-outer.
In the Summer Cup she appeared to have all sail set
coming into the straight, but her finishing run was feeble
and unconvincing, and she finished lengths behind the
placed horses. Her heavy weight in bad going was set
down as the cause, but Mahee, in the top division, won.
In Tatt.’s Cup she was never further away than third,
and eventually scored from the handsome little Acmena,
who was within an ace of beating - her. On several occa-
sions (Quiver has disappointed her party, notably in Melb.
Cup, for which she started second favorite. The penalised
Mahee was never in Tatt.’s Cup, shaping badly, but the
favorite, Fort, made even a worse exhibition. He ap-
peared jaded and stale. No end of cash was carried by
Response, who also failed to make a decent show. The
time, 3.314, was decent, but all past contests show
nothing ap, reaching record-smashing. Nightingale’s 3.30
in ’94, when Mahee ran third, is the best chronicled.
* * * *
The swelled-head disease, inevitably caught by
prominent jockeys, is an Australian turf characteristic,
and its existence isn’t to be wondered at. When a pre-
viously unknown rider pulls off a big cup or handicap he’s
promptly interviewed, paragraphed in every paper, bar,
perhaps, the War Cry and the Methodist Ebexe/.er, and
his face-picture duly printed. Also, he is lauded to the
skies by his friends ; congratulated by the big, big owner,
the punter, the chap he used to make mud-pies with, the
bookie, spieler, and other nondescripts, anxious to make
his acquaintance. All of which tends to make him believe
lie’s a most superior person. The scene changes, though,
when he’s guilty of “unseemly conduct” later, and gets
three months' rest. The papers abuse him roundly, and
say he got too big for his boots; his friends call him
bad names until he rides and wins again. Then the old
slobber is poured on with a pint-pot. There are tio flies
onany jock, in the public estimation, so long as he wins.
* * * *
Melbourne started its new year with a fairly
disastrous day at Flemington. No actual favorite got
home, although the first winner, Kobold, was equal
favorite with Newhaven at 6 to 4 in a field of three. The
Tasmanian horse, Lord Charles Scott, made a good few
people happy after the Standish Handicap, but the lucky
on ‘s who played up their “ Scott” winnings went sorrow-
fully home. The Chevalier, often expected, turned up at
last, in the Bagot Handicap—a 15 to 1 chance in a field of
10, and the general grief came to a climax over the
victory of Blue Vest in the Criterion Stakes. Blue Vest,
a half-sister to Solanum, went out at 16 to 1 in a field of
eight. Fortunately, the V.R.C. had no cause to complain
about the gate-receipts.
M'Auliffe, who rode the Meddler, winner of
Tattersall’s Club Handicap, passing the winning-post,
thought Courallie had beaten him. So did Gough,
Courallie’s jockey, who remarked “ I just did you ! ” But
when the numbers went up M’Auliffe had won. M‘Auliffe
has just returned from America, where he has been riding
the kust two years. During ’92-93, M'Auliffe won 40 races
in i,.S YV., mostly country events.
* * * *
Austin Delaney, who rode the winner, True
Blue, in the Carrington Stakes, at Sydney, won on the
same horse the Nursery Handicap, 12 months ago, and
the Nursery Handicap at last Sydney Cup meeting. He
has been a jockey for six years, and this last is his biggest
win. Some three and a-half years ago, Delaney was hurt
in a railway accident, and didn’t ride for 18 months.

True Blue, winner of the Carrington Stakes
(£600) was but moderately backed by the public, but his
stable counted h ; m a good thing long back, and staked
big money on his chance.

The ancient absurdities of the horse-reporter are
being graited upon bike journalism, it seems. The horse-
reporter is at his stupidest when he speaks—as he oiten
does speak—of certain animals showing better “ form ”in
weight-for-age races than in handicaps, or vice-versa. We
are gravely informed that, whereas Pepper-box is superior
to Mustard-pot at even weights in a mile handicap, Mus-
tard-pot is the better horse when they meet on even terms
in “ good-class company.” Poor little punters swallow
this stuff, and “the Pot” is generally accepted as a
weight-tor-age specialist. The bike-reporter for Melb.
Arous talks similar nonsense re Martin, the Irish-Amurkan
plugger. “ Martin’s riding is improving every day, and
he is probably the best handicap-rider in Australia. As
a matter of fact, the man is always one and the same
individual, whether he rides in a handicap or races with a
crowd of other men from scratch. What he can do he
ctn do, and what he can't he can’t. And when Martin
does less than he might, it is because he doesn't feel very
well or the money doesn't tempt him to go all the way,
under the circumstances.

Paddy Nolan, the fine cross-country horseman,

The Sneaker, who won the Steeplechase at
Randwick last Saturday, is a queer jumper. He rises
so slowly that if he takes off Oin. closer than a fair thing
he hits the jump for certain; but it he takes off yards
behind a lair mark he goes over dead sure. The length of
his jump showed itsell against Reckless. The two would
race level to the jump, but over the jump the Sneaker
would be a length ahead.

True Blue, the Carrington winner, is by Hotch-
kiss, sire of Oscillator, and is just the sort oi youngster
for punters to keep an eye on with a view to smiting Ikey
Mo. in future big handicaps.
Courallie was the unlucky horse of the day, for
after getting locked up in the moving Carrington caravan,
he just got downed by a head in the Uluo Handicap by
the Meddler, a smart daughter of Trenton, specially served
up by John Mayo tor tiie race. The time, too, 2.9),
showed there was no loafing on the road.
Gulliver, Hopscotch’s half-brother, doesn’t ap-
pear to stay well. Kttridge was Rained tor carelessness
when Adoration beat him in the A.J.G. Two-year-old
Stakes. On New Year s Day, Gulliver was pounced upon
as “ first chop,” but Hordern s filly again caught and beat
him comfortably.
Now asserted that Kallara, a frost so far, will
probably finish into the best four-year-old handicap horse
of his year.

Euroclydon, the champion M.L. three-year-old,
didn't compete in Auckland uup or Dei bj. He comes to
Australia in the autumn to meet Auraria, Hova, Wallace

Maoriland will sell its gold-shares to back him.

The winners of the double, Summer Cup and
Carington stakes, Mahee and True Blue, are by sons of
Musket. It seems safe nowadays to bacx Musket blood
for all big handicaps.

Osculator, odds-on chance for the G.N. Derby
(M.L.), apparently didn’t get a place. The time put up by
Fabulist, 2.39 odd, tells a tale rather different from the
2.46 of Vic. Derby when Osculator was thereabouts.
Maoriland, from a turf aspect, is a Lana of snags and
Blighted Hopes. A champion prad there is champion for
about a week. Then some lank-looking, pigeon-toed,
badly-groomed outsider comes along and knocks the stuff-

At least half-a-dozen neddies contesting at
Xmas gatherings should be re-named “Tombstone.”
“Buried,” of course. In one case, however, the Corpse
was only surface covered and came to life later rather

over his lost cash. As a rule, however, 1. Mo. is fairly
cute, and doesn’t risk too much on corpses that are only
half dead.

St. Hippo’s second to Unita (a despised out-

his win in A.R.C. handicap next day, shows untroubled

autumn may see him at Flemington, strung up.

The old question “Is early two-year-old racing
desirable ? ” bobbed up again in Melb. last week, when the
. V.R.C. committee decided not to alter things. At present
youngsters may be raced after August 1. Argument;
This is too early, for it deteriorates the racehorses. Other
siders favor Oct. 1. Oppositionists aver that this would
strike a severe blow at the breeding industry. Personally,
the writer wouldn’t race a horse until he was a three-year-
old, but poor owners want oat-money and ny at good and
bad juvenile stakes. The rich owner does ditto. Who
suffers then? The horse, undoubtedly. No animal can
matui e into a crack aged pacer if he is raced off his legs,
cartel, a rnut from one province to another, and has the
life anu spirit lashed out of him when a child.

Mahee and Miner, failures at Flemington, were
equal to getting a cup apiece in the summer, though well-
weighted and untanoied. It s always the way. Good
horses get home sometimes, no matter what weight
they have, but it’s the exact time that trouoles what-
ever brain the punters possess. Anyhow, the old advice
is still good “ Always back the best. ’ If there’s no
“ best,” back the nag that people say has got no chance.

Now asserted that one of the chief objections to
Tatt. holding sweeps in (Queensland was their frequency,,
consultations being organised on ail small events, which,
should have been overlooked. Well, the public revenue
wasn't affected by the alleged greediness, anyway.
This story is told of a lately promoted Vic,
policeman. It was on board the old Holden Crown at a
publicans picnic that a certain well-known pug. (then at
the very top of the ladder) got nasty and was mildly
called to order by the very young anu harmless-looking
constable. “ Its all very well,” said the pug., “for you
to talk like that to ate—you know it s only your blanky
uniform saves you.” “If you think so,” quietly rejoined
the constable, “ I'm prepared to make you respect the
man as well as his uniform. Just you meet me at the
back beach.” They met, and the constable took off his
uniform. That pug. never forgot those eight rounds.
“ The ring,” he used to say, “lost a champion when that
fellow donned the blue.”

There are eight courses around Sydney devotee!
t> the alleged sport of pony trotting, and, in more sense:.
6 ian one, Sydney is “full” of pony racing.
A race scene. A crowd of hard-faced punters
h ig over the fence which separates the Leger from thi
Grand-stand enclosure. They are waiting for the “office.”
An abbreviated horse emerges from the paddock, th
jockey-boy glittering in colors and gold. He ambles alom
bv the fence, and, in response to the anxious enquiries o
h i mates, and greatly to the dismay of the greenhorn
wi > has already backed his mount, informs all and
sundry that he “Ain’t ’avin’ any.” As this remark applie
to nearly all the “ competitors,” the most difficult task of
the backer is to find the “triers.”
In a recent race, only one horse was trying.
Fate was in the humor for a joke ; the trier fell, and then
the fun began. The efforts of the others to lose wen
better than a circus. The three leaders were dead lev el,
each boy pulling at his mount as hard as he dared, and ai
the same time beating the air furiously with his whip
Of course, one of them had to win, but the face of hi-
owner was as long as a wet week. Never was a man so
obviously disgusted at success.
The patrons of one pony course were some time
ago afforded the edifying spectacle of a race where every
horse was “ dead.” There were only two horses in who
had any chance of success, and the two owners had each
backed the other’s neddy ! The rest of the field were not
at all in a hurry.
The pony-owner proposes, but the jockey dis-
poses, and the tip from the latter is the safest. The
riders are probably the most cunning in the world. There
was, not long ago, a case where a boy backed his mount
fora place— i.e., backed him on the tote—and backed
another to win. The “other” won, his own mount
getting second, being half-a-head behind the winner !
A favorite practice of the non-trier is to get a
bad start; all he has to do then is to keep behind. The
“ dead ’un ” can usually be detected by the superhuman
activity of the rider. The most hideous feature of these
meets is the crowd of wretched, blighted boy-men who
patronise them.

Yet another corpse now sleeps in Botany
Bay’s Procrustean,bed of prison quicklime. The
hanging of Sheridan was a wanton debasement of
the currency of justice. The Judge’s remarks in
sentencing the man left it to be inferred that he did
not wish him hanged, and most of the jurors have
declared that they did not contemplate execution
following on what they considered as merely a
formal verdict. The public, it seems plain, did
not desire the hanging, and, so far as The Bulle-
tin knows, there is not one newspaper which
has written on the subject without in
some _ form or other expressing the opinion
that life-imprisonment would have served all use-
ful purposes. For the hundredth time The Bul-
letin asks—When will some member of Parlia-
ment submit a bill empowering juries in capital
cases to say not only whether they believe a man
guilty, but if guilty how guilty they hold him to be ?
Yojury could possibly have bracketed the crime
of Sheridan, who by misadventure killed a woman
in procuring abortion, with that of the murderers
who kill for the sake of gain—with the deeds of
say) Nicholls and Lester, who, luring poor men
with promises of work, butchered them in cold
blood for the sake of their miserable silver watches
and trunks of clothing. The Bulletin knows
perfectly well that the hanging of Sheridan was
the deed not of Premier Reid, but was purely
attributable to certain pietistic influences repre-
sented in the Cabinet, and it sincerely hopes that
when the Assembly again meets the Premier will
introduce, or give his best support to, a bill under
which juries, instead of being able to shift any
measure of their responsibility on to the Execu-
tive, will be made to feel that the fate of a man
capitally charged -esi. so far as concerns the evi-
A NARROW ESCAPE.

lence available at the trial, wholly and solely in

Sheridan, the Sydney abortionist hanged
last Tuesday, died penitent after the stereotyped
fashion. He was apparently an energetic, busi-
ness-like man, and when he got into the con-
demned cell, and the gallows came actually in
sight, he set himself methodically to save his soul
as if it was a case of so much dirt to be removed
with a shovel in so many hours at so many cubic
feet per hour. Says the Star :
He rose at 6; a quarter of an hour later he made
his morning prayer and meditation. At 7 he said the
Rosary and had breakfast, afterwards exercise (if
allowed). At Bhe would indulge in spiritual reading, and
at 9 Sacred Scripture from the old text. At a quarter to
10 he had rest, and paid attention to his spiritual affairs,
and having spent three-quarters of an hour in that way
he proceeded with the examination of conscience. Then,
at II o’clock, he received the Litany of the Holy
Name, and afterwards the Seven Penitential Psalms,
At noon, he had his dinner and walking exercise.
In the afternoon, Sheridan commenced with the Rosary
and the Stations of the Cross. At 3, he read light read-
ing matter, and, between that hour and 5, had tea and
exercise. At 5, he said the Rosary, 20 minutes later the
Litany of Our Blessed Lady and the Miserere; at 5.30,
the Meditations, and an hour later the examinations of
the day. At a quarter to 7he said his night prayers. He
made at 9 o’clock each night a preparation, and went to
sleep each night saying (hymn omitted). He read ex-
tensively from the “ Imitation of Christ ” chapters
marked by the rev. chaplain, and from the Scriptures he
read similar chapters. During the day he attended to
the following injunction by the chaplain “ Offer your
heart fervently to God during the day, and each time
regret the past. Have recourse frequently to the help of
Mary, your Mother in Heaven, and reflect after on the
vanity of the world. “ God is all; man is nothing.”
It sounds weirdly methodical, doesn’t it? So
much soul to be saved ; so many hours to save it
in at so much soul per hour ; rise at six and shovel
vigorously at the soul till seven ; then breakfast
and more shovelling at the soul till noon ; then
dinner and more soul, barring a space for “light
reading matter;” tea and another desperate
attack on the soul till bed-time. As related in
the soulless papers, it is all so hideously like tin-
case of a business man who has undertaken to
deliver a lot of meat in a given time, and just
rushes the last forequarter over the gangway as
the ship is about to sail. If salvation comes b\
hard digging, Sheridan, who pegged in for a whole
month at 1 1 hours a day, deserved to get it.
“Jim” ELigue, ex-editor of Sydney E
News (“ account o’ the hexercution —speshul ’dee
shun!”) headed the deputation of M’s. P. who
pleaded for the life of the condemned Sheridan
If Sheridan had been present he would probably
have dug James in the ribs and asked him whether
he really meant it.
Says the foreman of the Sheridan jury :
The Judge, when summing up, explained to us that
according to the evidence Sheridan was technically guilt}
of murder. He however, told us that it was within our
province to return a verdict of manslaughter. This 1
wanted to do, but my colleagues argued, “ What does it
matter whether it is one or the other, they will not han
him, and whichever verdict is brought in Sheridan i.-
sure to be kept in gaol for the remainder of his life.”
Sweet simplicity ! It’s perfectly plain that then
are still a number of people in the country utterly
ignorant of the history of N.S.W. Executive. Ii
the Sheridan jury didn’t wish Sheridan to be
hanged, why didn’t they recommend him to mercy
failing a verdict of manslaughter ? The history o
N.S.W. shows that every jury should, wherevei
possible, dispense its own mercy. Up to now, be
it said to the credit of the Reid Govt., no convici
recommended to mercy has been hanged by tha
Ministry.

Apropos the Sheridan hanging at Sydney :
It is not generally known that nearly every “for-
tune-teller” is an abortionist’s pimp, and receives
from the illegal practitioner a fee, averaging two
guineas, for every woman “ in difficulties ” whom
she sends to him.
The very latest version of things from the
Transvaal is that Dr. Jameson’s invading army
consisted of only 460 men, that it fought 2710
Boers for 36 hours, and only surrendered when its
ammunition was exhausted and it had lost 137
killed and 37 wounded. If this process of enlarge-
ment goes on The Bulletin expects to hear next
week that Jameson invaded the Transvaal with
only himself and another man, and that he fought
5000 Boers for six weeks, until the other man was
utterly demolished by a long bombardment with
canister shot. It is also stated that if Jameson
had been successful the German ships at
Delagoa Bay were under orders to land a force
of marines and crumple him up, which would Lave
involved a raid through British territory, with a
great and gory war as a natural sequence.
Finally, it is reported that Rhodes has resigned
the Premiership, so presumably the evidence of
his complicity in Jameson’s raid has become too
strong to be resisted. If Rhodes did plan that
ugly muddled rush into the Transvaal, then he
isn’t the, Napoleon he was supposed to be —not by
a very long way. According to the most coherent
report, Jameson started with 700 men, and 300
supports so far behind that they never got there,
and 100 reinforcements in front who were cut off
before they reached him.

Dear Bulletin, —Notice how, when a
Christian dies, his friends say “Poor A. has gone.
How they give themselves away—if, as of coursej
he has gone aloft. The common man under
Imperial Rome didn’t say “poor”: he said
‘ 1 divus, ” which means ‘ ‘ gone to glory. ” Catullus,
who believed nothing, said in his ode to his dead
brother, “ Are atque vale,” which means “So long,
I shan’t see you again.” A Christian who believes
his faith shouldn’t talk like that. —IGNOTUS.

in the S.E. corner of S.A., and the western dis
trict of Vic. Moreover, all through the Aus-
tralias the disease has become far more common
of late years.
The pearl-divers at Manahiki and Penrhyn
Islands are probably the best in the world They
don’t bother about sharks —indeed, the man-
eaters very seldom come on to the reefs, but they
are mortally afraid of the local eel —a fierce fellow
sft. long and vicious enough to snap at a kauri
board. The usual pay of the divers is 7.50 dols. a
month, and 5 cents per lb. on the shell they bring
up. Some of them make as much as 150 dols.
monthly. They spend it on European delicacies
and sewing-machines ; every house on the island
of Penrhyn has a hand sewing-machine, and both
men and women are expert machinists.
Nothing in particular recalls the story of a
rare old drill-sergeant, a master of his profession,
out feeble in grammar and other appurtenances of
language, who, years ago, had to drill Brisbane
Grammar-school girls, by way of a variation. The
dsars were out on parade, and the sergeant‘went
at ’em. “ Byer right, dress ! Now, watch my
movements : when I say, ‘ Ten-shern ! ’ do you
stand as I do. Heads well up, but chins down;
chests out, shoulders well back, hands straight
down at the sides, palms of the hands to the
front, little fingers in a line with the seam of the'
trousers —ahem, hem ” —then, turning to the lady-
principal, “Er, but I say, Miss, how’m I to tell
’em to keep their stummicks in ? I can’t say
‘stummicks,’ I s’pose?” “Not very well.” A
pause. And then, aloud —“ And mind you. girls,
keep yer waists well in—like I do. ”
THE AUSTRALIAN GEM TRADE.
H. Newman, the well-known jeweller of 175
Elizabeth-street, Melbourne, is the largest buyer
of opal in Australia, and opal miners will find it
to their advantage to send their opal direct to
him. The firm has a reputation for straight deal-
ing extending over a period of 40 years, which is
sufficient guarantee to consignors that they will
be honorably treated. H. Newman is also a
buyer of all other Australian gems.*
John Archer, M.A., of Melbourne, refers
the public to “ a work not yet known,” for full in-
structions as to acceptable and answerable prayer.
Prayer, it appears, must be “offered in words
that are plain, simple, and concise without redun-
dancy of expression, without vain repetitions, and
without quotations from Scripture; and offered in
absolute confidence that it will be answered.”
Archer, M.A., confirms The Bulletin’s private
opinions on this all-important matter. The Lord
stipulates that even His most faithful petitioners
shall not drivel if He is to be expected to meet
their wishes. The prayer of the typical parson
availeth not at all. If you mean to get there, you
must pray in pithy, grammatical sentences. A
smart literary man’s prayer would come off every
time had he the necessary faith, therefore the
people who possess plenty of faith but no brains
or education should engage experienced paragraph-
ists to write them prayers which they may learn
by heart. A new industry.

A Magistrate Cured of Nervousness and Biliousness
160 Elizabeth-st., Melb., July 18, 1892.
Dear Sir.—l have much pleasure to inform you that a course of
your Alfaline Pills completely cured me of a severe case of biliousness,
wind and nervousness. I may also mention that several of n y friends
to whom I have recommended your remedies have derived great henet t
from them; therefore, J consider you are deserving of success, wmcu
1 do most; heartily wish you.

A Lady Cured of General Debility.
Hekr RASSMUSSEN. March 15th, 185)4.
k lr >—I hereby beg to certify that having been a sufferer from
General Debility of the Nervous System for over seven years, and
having tried without success several of the leading doctors both m
Sydney and Melbourne, I was advised to try your Alfaline Remedies.
I am thankful I did so, for after a few courses of the Alfaline Remedies
I am now completely cured, and I shall be most happy to recommend
your remedies to anyone suffering as I was. Thanking you for your
courtesy and the uniform patience with which you have treated me,
allow me to say that you can make what use you may think proper of
this. Wishing you every success, allow me to remain, yours
CATHERINE HAGERMAN.

A Wonderful Cure.
Herr Rassmussen. August, 1894
Dear Sir,—ln the year of 1871 I was eight days in the water sheep-
washing, and contracted rheumatism and stiffness in the joints, and
have tried all advertised medicines. When I came to Sydney I had a
great difficulty in walking, and went to the Turkish baths, which did
no good. Passing your window I saw a testimonial from Mr. E. W.
O’Sullivan, M.P., with the same complaint as I had, which led me to
try your Remedies. On Thursday before Good Friday It< ok the first
of your Pills; since then I have used 4 boxes Special Powerful Alfaline
V itality Pills, 3 boxes Special Powerful Alfaline Rheumatic Pills, with
Liver and Kidney Pills, and free use of your Alfaline Eucalyptus Oil,
and lain now, with the blessing of God, as well in health as I was 23
years ago. I can with great confidence recommend your Remedies to
anyone suffering from the same complaint. May you long be spared
under God to be a blessing to suffering humanity.
I remain, dear sir, yours very gratefully, ' JOHN KEAY.

To Herr Rassmussen.
Dear Sir, —I have much pleasure to inform you that your Alfaline
Remedies have acted most wonderful in my case, and I consider that
the great virtues you claim for them have been entirely substantiated
not only in my case, but in several of my family and acquaintances to
whom I have recommended their use. I consider they are far more
efficacious than any remedy yet brought before the public. I consider
you are second to none as a human benefactor.
I am, yours truly, EDWARD DREW.
A Lady’s Wish Fulfilled
It gives me great pleasure indeed to inform you that your cele-
brated Alfaline LTnivers.d Pills cured me, when all other remedies and

The Jester of the Damned.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
The Laughter-Maker was dead who had shaken
the world with mirth ;
His soul flew up from the grave, leaving a mournful
earth ;
Up through the web of the stars, till he came to
the Gates of Gold,
And there he claimed admittance, right haughtily
and bold :
“ Out on the earth You created, my laughter can
move them all;
When thay saw my name on the coffin, they snig-
gered under my pall.
“ When the collar was tight and galling, the yoke
too heavy to bear,
I taught them how to ease it, I lightened the load
of care.
“ Weary and wasted women, haggard and hopeless
men,
Drank for a moment from Lethe, learnt to be
merry again ;
“ Laughter bred patient courage ; I, with my gibes
and quips,
Taught them to dance in the fetters, laugh at the
curling whips—
“ They whom love had forsaken, they whom love
had accurst,
T 1 © whose souls were ready out of their lives to
burst,
“They whom the world had trampled—asking
but breathing space—
Rose and conquered the world by laughing back
in its face.
“ Gaze on the green globe yonder, whirring and
spinning along !
Through the hoarse jar cf its erglues cat:'i you a
wisp of song ?
“ Mine is the song they are siugin,-,, mine is the
mirth you hear,
Over the steaming turmoil and jangle of rusted
gear:
“ Laugh when the strain's severest—make it aj
you can l
Smile at the nerve that tingles—conquer it—-prove a
ma n /
“ Play with the scythe and hour-glass—grin for his
grin give Death /
Show him you are his master —laugh with your
dying breath !
“ This is the creed I have practised, this is the faith
I taught—
Ask of the Millions yonder the miracles it has
wrought.
“How do you reckon the tally? What is the
wage I hold ?
Have I not earned my welcome? Open the Gates
of Gold ! ”
Strangely the Judge smiled, speaking, “Judge of
yourself you’ll be—
You are paid in the coin you pay with ; and for
the payment—See ! ”
Opened the lapis arches, parted the sapphired
sheen —
The lj m '•hter-Maker fell on his knees at the sight
revealed between.
All the glow of a garden, all that a sunset shows,
All the distracting beauty that flushes the face of
a rose !
Hues that play in the opal, shadows on molten
gold,
Just ere the ingot, cooling, frosts in the shielding
mould!
Music the midnight planets murmur down in the
deep, # •
All the haunting faces thronging a Poet’s sleep !
“Now,” said the Judge, “ for your verdict! What
does th it Ruby declare ?
Look in the mirror of blood and flame, and read
your answer there ! ”
A strutting, leering clown, with a hideous vainted
face,
Dull, soulless eyes and coarse lips curled in a
mountebank’s grimace !
Said the Judge, as there rose faint harmonies of
some celestial hymn:
“ How would that figure look, think you, in the
choir of the Seraphim ?
“ What have the Blest with laughter? They have
no whips to endure ;
You and your Art grotesque would here have a
sinecure. ”
The Laughter-Maker saw and heard, and he knew
his ugliness !
He turned away and dropped in dismay to the
depths of nothingness.
Till he came to the Other Gates—black and rusty
and grim—
And through the keyhole flew fiery tongues that
sputtered and spat at him.
Back thev flew at his summons, and out on the
roaring flame
Camj oiieers upon cheers in chorus, when the
Janitor gave his name.
“Welcome, O Laughter-Maker ! Bring him with
honors in,
Truly our Lord is good to the suffering sons of
Sin !
“ Here is the balm we have needed—give us a
rousing joke!
Help us to emptv our lungs of the stench of the
sulphur smoke!
“ Make us scoff at the brimstone, teach us to laugh
at the coals,
Yours shall it be to win the debris of the hearts of
poor damned souls.
“Way for the grand procession ! Room for the
Lords of Hell !
Guards, present your pokers ! Ring the Great
Fire Bell !
They marched the Laughter-Maker in : Cerberus
wagged his tail;
Charon caught a crab with joy, when he joined in
the crowd’s “ All Hail !”
They gave him a lofty throne on the edge of a
crater’s pit,
With heralds around in a ring to trumpet forth
his wit.
Loud they blared his laughter, over the burning
seas,
Into the bubbling cesspits, bringing a brief sur-
cease
To roast and toast and turning-spit and skewer
and frizzling hide,
The rabid devouring draught that flew through the
damper open wide.
They tied their tails in true-love knots, danced
round him where he sat;
But they prodded his ribs with toasting-forks
whenever the joke fell flat.
They splashed him over with lava, made him skip
on red-hot bricks,
Gave him to drink from a kettle’s mouth —till he
had to learn new tricks.
And when his wage they threw him, laugh ie .* and
shouting “ Encore! ”
He picked it up—’twas heated pence—and then
they laughed the more.
There in the City of Devils—star of comedians he,
Plays the lead in a one-act farce for all eternity.
And sitting where they have throned him, the
Jester of the Damned,
At times he thinks of the Gates of Gold, that in
his face were slammed,
And then his laugh is loudest! never he plays
so well,
As when he remembers Heaven, he —who is
damned in Hell !

The Dutch Malthusian League, which
flourishes under. Government patronage and is
b y “ right-thinking people ”in its own
stolid gm-drinking country, has appointed a widow
lady to furnish information and advice to enquir-
mg wives and mothers re the rational limitation
of their family circles. Evidently, the young
Queen of Holland, when she marries, will not be
expected to follow the example of Our Gracious,
who positively prides herself on being the mother
of nine.
Salicylic acid is now well known as a
remedy for rheumatism. It is given internally in
various forms, but recently a physician has been
trying its effects in rheumatic cases when applied
to the skin. The acid was applied in the propor-
tion of ten parts to ten parts of lanolin, and 100
parts of lard ; 2 drs. of this ointment were rubbed
into various portions of the patients’ body every
four hours, about 60grs. of the acid thus being
used in-24 hours. The effects are said to have
been satisfactory, more especially as no dis-
turbance of digestion took place.

Dear Bulletin, —P. Luftig calls the big
Queensland saurian an alligator ; Ohas. Hedley
says it’s a crocodile. Nathless so staid a journal of
SC i? n .]'^ < ' bght and leading as London Nature
called the Q. beast an alligator on at least one
occasion (May, 30, 1872), when it told how one
Easton found an alligator’s nest on Eighteen-Mile
Island in Fitzroy River. The crocodile has the
hind feet almost completely webbed, has a perpen-
dicular horny fringe on the back of the hind legs,
has the fourth tooth of the lower jaw fitted into
an external notch in the upper jaw, so as to be
generally visible when the mouth is closed. The
alligator has smoothly-rounded hind legs, very in-
completely-webbed hind toes, has fourth tooth of
the lower jaw fitted into an internal pit in the
upper ja,w, and therefore quite invisible when the
mouth is closed. Also, whereas crocodiles are
found the world over, alligators are confined to
America. The Central American crocodile has a
strong, musky odour. Re Mr. Hedley’s remarks
that, ‘ ‘ Probably the crocodile’s coasting certificate
allowed him to travel from river mouth to river
mouth within the shelter of the Barrier Reef, but
not to navigate the rough open sea,” the crocodile
is not indigenous to the Cocos Islands in the
Indian Ocean, yet at long intervals an odd croco-
dile turns up there to astonish the natives. The
nearest land to the Cocos is Java, about 700 miles
off, where crocodiles abound. If a crocodile can’t
navigate the rough, open sea, how does he ne-
gotiate that 700 miles ?—Steele Grey.

main walks of the establishment are half a mile

We stepped on to Bowen Pier (writes a
cheerful correspondent) and were surrounded by a
crowd of black maidens dressed in white teeth and
satin polish—that was the lot. They had one,
only one, salutation—“ Chuck ’em sixpen.” Those
who understood threw a silver coin into the sea,
and the damsels aforesaid (full-grown women)
plunged in like black seals, reaching it before it
fluttered to the bottom of the clear water, and
rising with it in their lips. They were full-grown
women, so nice and plump that I couldn’t help
patting one gently on the back. These young
ladies had a chaperone, an old dame with a con-
certina face, who, shouting like a demon, skir-
mished round in a canoe. The old lady, who was
doubtless Adam’s grandmother, had the satin-
polish clothing without the teeth ; her figure was
like footballs with the wind out of them, and her
shanks ! Bowen Pier is miles long ; when you
have reached the shore end you flounder in sand,
eventually finding a main street with a magnificent
stretch up a hill. There are plenty of houses, but
the only living thing we saw was a horse grazing
in the middle of the road. He looked up with a
startled air when he saw us; we were evidently
the first human creatures he had ever seen. In
the distance we saw a dog walk across the street
and lie down ; for the rest, the town was a vast
solitude. We retreated back into the scrub—the
place made us sad. On board again, one of the
: passengers declared he had awakened an hotel-
keeper and got a drink, but for the rest of the
voyage this man was regarded as a hopeless liar.
For no one will wake up in Bowen till the last
trump.

“ Never introduce your donah to a pal.”
Styles, M.L.A. (Vic.) laid himself out in
the recent Railway Bill debate to show that the
N.S.W. lines are not what they are cracked up to
be: —
Now, I find from that report that for the six years end-
ing the 30th June, 1888, the special votes for the N.S.W.
railways amounted to £3,388,555 ; while for the next six
years ending 30th June, 1894 since the railways have
been under the control of commissioners—there was no
less than £4,815,377 voted by the N.S.W. Parliament for
the maintaining, working, and improving of the N.S.W.
railways. I apprehend also that this enormous sum
covers up the deficit, because their statements do not
show any deficit at all, nor can it be found in one of their
reports since 1889 that there is any deficit. I would like
to point out that the sum of £4,815,377 for six years is an
average of £802,563 per annum ; yet we talk of our
deficit of £300,000 or £400,000 a year in this colony as
something dreadful. In N.S.W. the people do not
grumble at voting £BOO,OOO a year.

Digger-Man : “ Among the Coolgardie
blacks therapeutics seem to have become a lost
science. Nature has seemingly immunised them
against most of the diseases to which flesh is heir,
as a compensation for their repellent surroundings,
and hence they keep neither medicine men, ram-
makers, sky-pilots, nor any class of scientists
whatsoever. I once saw a flighty gin who a few
days previously had received the customary re-
proof for a breach of conjugal fidelity, viz. , a spear
through both thighs, and though, as an eye-witness
stated, ‘ she howled a bit ’ while it was being ex-
tracted, yet the only remedy she applied was sand
to plug up the holes as a precaution against
the flies. Similar wounds would have proved
fatal to a high percentage of whites, and have laid
the remainder up for months, yet Loo was ambling
round apparently insensible to pain.”

“ Tlie lien who Hake England.”
We are indebted to the courtesy of a gentleman well known in
Liverpool for the following interesting and instructive particulars. He
writes :
“ I venture to think the following will be read with interest by
you and any English people who have friends abroad, and their name
is legion. Quite recently I was a passenger by the midnight train
from Euston to Liverpool. I was travelling in a third-class compart-
ment, and with me there were a quiet, resolute-looking man about
thirty-five, a middle-aged sailor, and a young fellow who stated he was
twenty-two. The latter informed us he was sailing from Liverpool to
Lagos, on the West Coast of Africa, in the course of a few days,
which drew from our quiet-looking friend, ‘ Queer place, Lagos. I was
there eighteen months.’ ‘Unhealthy?’ ‘ Rather; just about the worst
you can hit on. But I kept fairly right.’ ‘How did you manage?’
‘ Well, take this from me straight—cut all spirits, brandy especially,
and always have Beecham’s Pills handy.' ‘ Beecham’s Pills ? ’ ‘ Yes;
I’ve knocked about the world a good deal, and am just off to Rangoon,
where I have a berth cutting teak, and I should never feel safe without
them.’ ‘Right you are,’ chimed in the sailor. ‘I was in Brazil,
Santos, but a few months ago, and they were the regular thing for
keeping you right out there. I came home last week, and here is my
last box,’ producing one from out of his waistcoat pocket. This testi-
mony from ‘the men who make England’ was perfectly genuine, and it
gives me pleasure to communicate it to you.
“ I will just add the following, which was read to me the other
day, it being an extract of a letter from a prosperous young magistrate
at Esk, Queensland, to his father in Liverpool: ‘ I am exceedingly busy,
and on Saturdays can hardly get through; and just now, if a customer
does not ask for wire fencing, he is certain to want Beecham’s Pills,
You had better send me further consignments of these sharp.’ ”
Here you have Australia, West Africa, Eastern Asia, and Brazil,
and climates good and bad. We often hear, “Go where you will you
will find Englishmen,” but we must now add, “ and BEECHAM’S
PILLS.

IMPORTANT NOTICE TO CIGARETTE SMOKERS.
WE beg to inform our customers and cigarette smokers generally that the American Tobacco Co.,
Ltd., of N.S.W., who control the sale of cigarettes known under the brands of “ Allen and
Ginter’s Straight-cut No. 1,” “Cameo” and “ Old Judge,” and who manufacture the colonial-made
cigarettes called “ Pure Gold ” and “Dixon’s No. 1, ’’have given us official not ice that they will not
supply us with any of their American-made cigarettes unless we agree to relinquish the agency held by
us for New South Wales for the world-renowned English firm of W. D. and 11. O. WILLS, Limited,
the manufacturers of those popular high-class cigarettes known as
ct THREE CASTLES 77 and “CAPSrA]N.”
We have declined to conform with this request, as we feel it would not be to the nterest of
cigarette smokers in New South Wales to allow the American Tobacco Co.. Limited, to monopolise
the whole of the cigarette trade. We, therefore, appeal to cigarette smokers to try the celebrated
Wills’ “Three Castles” and “Capstan” Cigarettes,
And compare their quality with that of any other. We are confident that their verdict will be in
favor of the
“ Three Castles” and “ Capstan ” Ciga,rettes,
And by smoking these they will prevent any one Company from attempting to dictate what people
should or should not smoke.

“He ought to ask her to go with him,” I

“Do. It would be a nice little spell. The boss

“ The boss would be all right, but—you know—
it seems a bit funny. I’ve never done it before. ”
Another pause. We were nearing South Yarra,
my destination. She must make up her mind
before I got out.
Suddenly she looked at me sitting opposite.
“ Yes,” I answered with my eyes and all my mind.
“ All right; I’ll go. I’d like to, Mr. , Fred

“ Smith,” he replied, as I left the carriage at the

“You must be quite mad, Mary Grey, toencour-

my conscience.

Dear Bulletin, — You mention a Mirboo
farmer who lias a white duck that lays black eggs.
m ■ So much for Gippsland. They are easily
amused down there. Now I have a goat (of the
female persuasion) which, during the present
scarcity of grass, has nourished itself *n an exclu-
sive diet of old tin cans, &e.; result, from a quart
to a quart and a half per day of condensed milk
in tins, ready sealed and labelled. But my next
door neighbor, Mr. O’Hooligan, scoffs at this.
His youngsters have a pet sheep, of the comeback
denomination, which has been feeding lately on
all manner of garbage, principally cast-off rags,
and he reckons next spring to shear some pounds
of Castlemaine flannel ; at present, it looks more
like flannelette. We have several more specimens
of this class up our way, including a cow which
gives separated milk in the morning and pure
cream at night. -WVhangaroo.
Agent-General Saul Samuel has purchased
for New South Wales the necessary apparatus to
work the Bertillon-Galton systems of criminal
identification. S.A. has been using the Galton
thumb-impress method for some time past, and
only needs the addition of the Bertillon measure-
ments to make its records of convicted
criminals complete. The two systems com-
bined are gradually being adopted through-
out the world, and, according to the report
of the 1895 Paris Prison Congress, France,
Russia, United States, Norway, Switzerland,
Roumania, Argentine, British India and Great
Britain are using them. So effective have they
proved in France that criminals there have almost
entirely abandoned aliases as a futile subterfuge'
Meanwhile, however, Victoria refuses to incur the
slight outlay that the adoption of the systems
would entail. It prefers to stick to the old
clumsy, uncertain method of relying partly on
photographs and largely on the uncertain recollec-
tions of Policeman X. Consequently, it is not sur-
prising that at latest advices the local Government
Statist was worrying his soul in an attempt to
devise some plan of approximately estimating the
province’s annual number of first offenders. Of
course, so long as one province like Victoria
stands out, it tends to nullify the progress of its
neighbors. It simply means that N.S. W.’s ex-
periment witli the new methods must be confined
to the criminals of N.S. Wales, whereas, if the
Victorian police department co-operated in the
matter, both capitals could soon, by an inter-
change of criminal descriptions, compile complete
particulars of the recidivistes of both provinces.
This would make an “old hand ” identifiable as
such, by the police in either province, in a few
minutes.
A slight hitch occurred at Normanton (Q.)
recently when the bore struck a large supply of
water at 2100 ft. Before completing the contract,
it was necessary to have the water tested as to
quality, but it was found impossible to get a man
within a radius of 200 miles who had tasted water
“ neat ” since his hours of happy childhood.
Several could give a tolerably reliable opinion,
they said, if it was diluted with whisky, but as
the contractor wanted an opinion on water only, a
special man had to be sent from the South.
It appears that “Wales 'was sojourning
with Sir Edward Levy-Lawson, chief proprietor of
London Daily Telegraph, when a spark from
his royal gun got into his royal eye. The D.T.
was started on democratic lines, as ideas went 30
or 40 years ago. Compared with the Times, the
new penny rag was a howling radical insult to
respectability. Its policy and G. A Sala and
Others made it into a popular journal and a colossal
property. Fine property and democratic prin-
ciples don’t work together for long if sassiety can
help it. The D.T., under the control of its
Hebrew founder’s high-toned successors, degene-
rated into a “great” newspaper, and now the
Heir Apparent slaps its chief capitalist on the
back. Levy Lawson will shortly blossom into'a
peer. It is very distressing for The Bulletin to
think over these things. The circulation of this
pestilent, disloyal paper increases, and the coming
profits cast a shadow before—the shadow of a
stout, important-looking personage, in a coronet
and a frock coat and white spats. This is believed
to represent The Bulletin proprietor of 1995, or
thereabouts, as he will appear when he runs over
from the House of Lords to look in at the office
and say “ haw ! ” He is the fruits of radical
journalism in the third or fourth generation, and
there’s no getting away from him.
The Maoriland Government has so far
given no compensation to Meikle, the alleged
cattle-stealer. Meikle was sentenced to seven
years, on the evidence of a shady ruffian named
Lambert, who swore that he met him and his son
in the act of removing the allegedly-stolen beef.
The prosecution was conducted with so much
ability, and the evidence was worked up so ably
by the police, and the defence was so weak from
sheer want of money, that it never came out at the
trial that Lambert was drunk in a distant town,
and young Meikle in bed with a serious illness, at
the time of the pretended crime. When Meikle
emerged from prison he hunted up the missing
evidence and convicted Lambert of perjury, but
the State, which had prosecuted the wrong man
so vigorously, flatly refused to assist in prosecuting
the right one. Also, despite Lambert’s convic-
tion for perjury, it never instituted any enquiry
into the methods by which the prosecution
smothered evidence which would have blown its
case against Meikle into small dust. Neither,
as already remarked, has it as yet paid Meikle any
compensation.
The Tragedy of a Pipe.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
The tobacco had run out, and a week’s miser j
stared them in the face.
The two men left their supper with hungry an 1
unsatisfied looks. The elder sat moodily si tr. i '
at the fire. The younger rose, after a d.s.nh
silence, and shuffled out of the hut.
“I ain’t goin’ far,” he said; “be back in an
hour’s time.”
“ I wonder what’s keeping Tom,” said Jim
Wharton as he walked aimlessly in the direction
his mate had taken.
Suddenly he saw the missing man crouched be-
hind a tree, apparently half asleep. From his
mouth smoke was slowly floating upward.
“ By God, Tom’s got a plug of tobacco!” he
hissed, the blood rushing to his rugged face; “and
—and I’ve been his pal for 15 years ! ”
Noiselessly he made his way back to the hut,
and, taking down the shot-gun from over the bed,
grimly returned to the spot. Tom’s look of un-
utterable content nerved his arm : his aim was
true.
An hour later two men drove up to the hut.
“ Hello, Jim ! We’re a week before our time.
How’s your tobacco? I bet it’s I say,
Jim ! where is Tom ? ”
“ You’ll find him over there. I shot him. lie
was my pal for 15 years, and he done me out of a
pipe.”
At Jim Wharton’s official murder the parson
heard him mutter, “He was .my pal for 15
years ”
“ Why, in Heaven’s name, then, did you mur-
der him ? ” whined the man in black.
“ He done me out of a plug of tobacco,” ex-
plained the prisoner as the hangman adjusted the
cap.
But the parson didn’t smoke.

A well-known South Sea Island trader,
lately returned from a cruise, remarks that canni-
balism is a dail y occurrence in M alayta. Malay ta,
it may be mentioned, is the island from which
Bananaland imports most of its Polynesian mur-
derers. The next Q. sensation may be a cannibal
feast on the banks of the Burnett or Pioneer.
At Mystic Park, Swanhill district, a
“snake man,” named Davis, lately captured for
Melb. University physiological department 91 fine
tiger snakes in four days. His first afternoon he
took 1(>, his second 17. On his third with some
local assistance he got 37. All he got for these 91
dangers of sudden death was a five-pound note.
The tigers are now in four big cages, and are
weekly taken out, one at a time, and “ milked ”of
their venom, which is used for experimental pur-
poses by Prof. Halford and his assistant. One of
the snakes is a great and particularly ill-con-
ditioned brute, who strikes at anything waved
within a foot of him, and, when doing so, he flat-
tens out the first six inches of his neck like a cobra
to a width of 2 in. Davis, by the way, pref< rs
handling tiger snakes. “You can easily tell wht n
a tiger is going to strike, but you can’t with a
black snake.” He has been bitten several times,
and probably several non-fatal doses have made
him immune.

of Australia Limited. SOLICITORS
THE obiects of the company are to acquire from Mr. Jobson (late engineer for the Broken Hill
Water Supply, and now head of the Government Water Supply Department at Coolgardie and
Hannan’s etc.) his methods and plans for condensing water and supplying the same under a compre-
hensive scheme to Coolgardie, Hannan’s, Kalgoorlie, Menzies’, White Feather, and other goldfields,
mining centres or districts in Western Australia, and from Mr. Drysdale all his water rights and other
rie-htslind privileges in connection therewith in the above localities, and to take over and carry out an
Agreement dated the 19th day of December, 1895, and made between Christopher Jobson and Henry
Henderson Drysdale of the one part and Charles William Chapman of the other part.
To suddlv the gold fields and the mining towns of Western Australia and the surrounding districts
with water for any purpose whatsoever, and to carry on the business of water works and water supply
ki all its branches and generally to sell and deal in water and the supply thereof, and to do all matters
*“ and will be in full week in less
than two months (and from these alone careful calculations show a handsome profit, after allowing for
all contingencies', and ample capital will remain for the purchase and erection of other two plants in
localities to lie chosen.
Mr. Jobson has been engaged as the company’s Manager and Engineer for one year, with the
option of a re-engagement at the end of that period. -
He will immediately proceed with the work, and devote his whole attention to the business of the
company.
For the information of shareholders who may not be aware of the fact, Wallaroo, the largest
mining town and a port of South Australia, for years had to be supplied during the dry season with
water from condensers.
Coolgardie, Kalgoorlie, Dundas, Norseman,- White Feather, Broad Arrow, Menzies, Mount
Margare". and other goldfields in West Australia have now to be almost entirely supplied with water
condensed from the salt wells and lakes of the district, the opportunities for conserving water being
exceptionally difficult, uncertain and involving great expense.
The condensing business is carried on in a small and desultory way with inadequate appliances,
hence the product is very costly. Under Mr. .Tobson’s scheme the salt water will be pumped from
many sources to central condensing stations, and there distributed to tanks with stand pipes, minimis-
ing the cost and assuring the supply.

[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
It was at Auckland (M.L.). Three of us
were concerned—young Hiram A. Parker, of
Boston (U.S.A.), globe-trotter ; Stimson, youthful,
but mate of an American ship; and myself,
Thomas Dana, Maorilander. We lived at the
same hotel, and together tinted the town. Most
of the trouble was due to that glittering idiot,
Parker, his desire to experimentally smoke opium,
and his deranged habit of carrying a pitiful in-
strument he called “my gun,” with which he
could hit nothing, even on oath. The balance of
the perplexity was due to Stimson and his morbid
craze for practical joking. I, naturally guileless,
was led into it all.
* * * *
Only Parker and I went opium-smoking.
Stimson declined, probably anticipating disaster.
The malign wisdom of the serpent was Stimson’s.
He said he was “too fatigued” to take his ex-
aggerated feet off the balcony rail. Parker and I
hired a private room from a Mongolian in the
Chinese quarter for our opium debauch. Parker
smoked five pipes, and then made even more kinds
of a United States lunatic of himself than usual.
Ultimately, he emptied his usual “gun” at the
lamp and missed. No one noticed, because the
thing made less noise than a healthy cracker.
Six Chinamen conveyed Parker, who, though
minute, was vivaciously vicious, to a cab. He
made me a commodious footstool, returning.
Next morning, after breakfast, Stimson and I
smoked in the balcony, while Parker, in the bar,
mixed himself the albumenized abomination he
termed “ egg-cocktail,” which invariably made
the barmaid ill to look at. I narrated to
Stimson, though- Parker had forbidden me, the
over-night transactions. Stimson’s unholy mind
at once went to work to concoct catastrophes.
“ Have you noticed,” he asked, “that Parker
has a peculiar fear of English law ? ”
“I have.”
“Parker thinks English police can sentence a
foreigner without trial, eh ? ”
I said “ yes,” because I had once, when bilious,
or Parker had fired too much “ gun” or something,
acquainted the Bostonian with this great principle
of British jurisprudence.
“ Well, I reckon there’s trouble ahead of
Parker. Where did the bullets go last night ? ”
said Stimson.
“ Stuck in the wall. They wouldn’t go through
hot butter, you know. There they are.”
“ Does Parker know you have them ? ”
“No ; he thinks that squirt of his a Krupp, and
that the bullets hurtle through space.”
Here Parker came on the balcony, smiling a fat
smile, his mouth plastered with egg and stickiness.
Stimson, affecting not to see him, went on like
this :
“Yes, I guess it was just awful. A Chinese
grandfather, a Chinese grandmother, and a
grandson, were all shot dead through the wall of
the next house, an opium-den. Six shots, the
detective just told me, had been fired from an
American revolver.”
Parker bucked, audibly.
“ There’s nothing about it in the paper yet,”
drawled Stimson ; “ won’t be, till they arrest the
murderer.”
The balcony quaked as Parker shivered, and
crept closer to us.
“ If they catch the assassin, the police in this
country can hang him without trial, can’t they ? ”
said Stimson.
“Under section 73, Charles 1., cap. 404, they
can’t (Parker looked relieved) —unless he happens
to be an alien. They can execute suspected
foreigners at sight.”
The balcony quivered as if from earthquake
shock.
“ Well, I hope they’ll catch the brute,” and
Stimson yawned and loafed downstairs.
“ Wh-a-at’s all that?” asked Parker, white as
pallid death.
I repeated Stimson’s story.
“ Holy Hosea ! what shall we do? ”
“We '? I have nothing to do with it, Mr.
Parker. Don’t blame me for your murderous
folly.”
“You ain’t going back on me, Dana?” he
whined.
“ No, though you have killed three unoffending
Chinese. The police are bound to hang someone
for those murders. If they don’t trace you they’ll
hang some other alien. Surely you couldn’t let an
innocent man hang for your crime ? ”
“ Oh, I think I could,” he rejoined.
Here Stimson burst upon us. “ The police are
below !” he said, excitedly. “ They are search-
ing ! They’ve traced the murderer here. Sainted
Samuel ! ” he gasped, as if with sudden enlighten-
ment, “you boys weren’t up to any devilment last
night with Parker’s gun ?”
But Parker was already in retreat. He snatched
the key of the box-room from its hook, vanished
into that dungeon-like and rat-haunted hole, and
locked himself in.
Stimson fell into a balcony chair and wheezed
and laughed in his interior till he was indisposed.
The landlord appearing, and learning the tragedy,
promptly had apoplexy or something. It was
agreed that it would conduce to Parker’s eternal
welfare to permit him occupation of that box-room
for a term. When the landlord recovered enough
lie started downstairs, and sent up people to con-
sole Parker through the keyhole.
A waiter came first and whispered sympathetic-
ally : “ Mr. Parker, sor, sure the polis, hell to
their sowls! is searching your room, sor ! ”
Parker said, faintly : “ My poor mother ! ”
Sandy M‘Kenzie, of the bank, groaned into the
keyhole : “ Murderer, the peelers have found your
gun ! ”
Then Stimson : “ Say, Parker, are there any of
your fixin’s you’d like sent home, so’s they could
keep your memory green when you’re dead ? ”
Parker said, “ Go away ! Oh, do go, Stimsom
The police may trace you here. Go a— icay . do !
A little Hebrew ' drummer, whom Parker
loathed, stuttered through the aperture: ‘ ‘ Misther
Parker, ma tear ; the polish vasn’t takin’ all your
tings—only de leetle gunsh. I vill give you tree
pound for your closhe, your vatches and all your
tings. Dey vash no good to you ven you vash
hanged. I vill put de monish under de door; only
shay before a vitness de tings are mine. Here’s
de Bootsh. Shay, ‘ Aaronheimer, its a bargain ; ’
shay it, ma tear, and I’ll boke my bill at tree
months beneat’ de door ! ”
Parker said, “Take that little beast away.
Go away all of you—go a— way ! ”
We all pretended to leave. The barmaid stole
to the keyhole.
“Hiram,” she cooed, “I shall never see you
again ! Here’s my scissors, under the door ; see
them ? Out a lock of your pretty hair and pass it
under. ”
She sobbed, winking her disengaged eye at us.
There was a sniffling and snipping, and then about
ten short sandy hairs were thrust through the key-
hole, and Parker blubbered :
“ I’ve kissed my handle of the door ; you kiss
your side. Good-bye ! ”
There was a pause, then Parker called : “ Miss
Mann —Carrie ! ”
“Yes, Hiram.”
“You might mix me an egg-cocktail. I could
suck it through a straw through the keyhole—
plenty of sugar, dear Carrie ! ”
She could only say, “The police! They’re com-
ing ! ” and go into the balcony and scream. We
all screamed a good deal.
* * * *
We permitted Parker two hours’ rumina-
tion. Then the landlord reflected that Parker’s
absence from the bar involved loss of trade. So I
went to undeceive Parker. Several persons accom-
panied me.
“ All right, Parker ! Come out ! ”
No answer !
“ Unlock the door, Parker, you blazing idiot ! ”
Deathly silence !
The landlord waxed very glum. We consulted,
then kicked open the door.
Parker was gone ! He had squeezed through
the small, high window, dropped on the roof of an
outhouse, and gained the ground. Stimson and I
writhed with merriment. The landlord didn’t.
The reSt regarded Stimson and myself in the light
of Parker’s destroyers, and recounted the manifold
virtues of the absconder, meaningly.
The day passed. No Parker !
The night—no Parker !
Public feeling in the hotel unmistakeably con-
demned us two. It was astonishing how everyone
had loved Parker, though they had given no pre-
vious hint of their affection. We searched the
town for him. No trace !
* * * *
In the evening of the next day Stimson
and I went into Parker’s rooms, ordered whiskys
there, and watered them with our tears, regarding
his voluminous properties, which he loved, with
sad eyes, picturing him stark, cold, and dead,
floating in the harbor. We had more whisky and
thought of his bereaved relatives. The door was
softly opened.
There stood Parker !
Stimson ejaculated : “ It’s his ghost ! ” and
crawled unostentatiously under the bad.
But Parker said: “ ’Tisn’t any time for fool-
acting. I’ve only an hour to pack. I’ve taken
passage to Sydney. ”
Stimson crawled out and got possession of
Parker’s “ gun,” which the latter was looking at
with fearful surprise, thinking the police had
seized it.
Said Stimson : “ Parker, my bumptious Boston
boy, it’s all a flam, a hoax, a sell. You killed no
one —you couldn’t if you tried. The police are
not after you —and ”
But Parker had rushed and “downed ” Stimson,
strong as the latter was, and was attempting to
chew him. Suddenly relinquishing that victim
he discharged furniture and jugs at me, sat down
breathless, sobbed, laughed, used profane language,
and finally remarked, “ Let’s have cocktails.”
Over them he told his ingenuous story.
He, after escaping, made his way by back
streets to the wharf, purchasing sailor’s clothes (in
which he was dressed) en route, and had then
taken boat to the American sailing ship, Jabez
Snow ; Jabez Snow, master. He confided in that
conscienceless down-easter, with the result that
Jabez extracted £ 100 which Parker obtained from
his agent for a passage to Sydney. The previous
night Parker had sadly spent on Mount Eden.
That day he had hidden on board the Jabez Snow,
“ Now,” he concluded, “ I allow to get that 500
dollars back from that pirate Snow, and if you
boys don’t help there’s going to be real murder. ”
Stimson became excessively contemplative, his
custom when revolving excessive rascality. After
a time he said, “ Guess I’ve a scheme.”
* * * *
They burst into my room next morning.
Said Stimson to me, “You’ve got a swallow-tailed
blue coat with brass buttons, white satin facings,
and gilt plastered all over, in which, when you
were a mean second mate of a liinejuice ship, you
used to attend bun-worries in England and try to
induce people to think you belonged to the British
Royal Navy—you know you did, you unbridled
young ass. I want that coat.”
And they took it, my most cherished possession,
for which I owed a London outfitter untold
moneys. And Stimson forced me‘to put on my
second best uniform, a frock-coat profusely gilt,
also a uniform cap. My coat and pants and cap
were six inches too short for Stimson, and when
lie had fitted himself into them and torn them,
he was a spectacular outrage. We put water-
proofs over all, cabbed to the wharf, took boat,
and pulled towards the ship. When we got near,
Stimson produced handcuffs and put them on
Parker, pulled off his waterproof, told me to do
the same, pulled out two police truncheons, and
proceeded to instruct me, while the boatman
thought he had shipped a private lunatic asylum.
“Now,” said he, finally, “it rests on you to
bluff Jabez Snow, who’s one of the hardest nails
ever sailed out of an American port.”
“ And why not you ! ” I asked.
“ Why, you thick-headed Britisher, because if I
open my mouth, Snow will know, from the purity
of my English, I must be an American.”
We hooked on to the Jabez Snow, and I swag-
gered up, feeling small.
There was a big, powerful, unpleasant-visaged
person, chewing tobacco, in a silk dust-coat and a
sun-hat on the quarter-deck, to whom I aiid, with
hauteur: —
“ Are you the master of this ship ? ”
“Thet’sso.”
“ Well, I am the principal pursuivant and chief
high hera Id of the Supremest Court of Judicature
of New Zealand. In the name of Her Gracious
Majesty the Queen of England and Empress of
India, I arrest you for being accessory, after the
fact, to the murders, by Hiram A. Parker, of
Amuk, Hong-Kong-Foo, and Alic. Anything you
may say in your defence will be used against you. ”
“ Stranger,” remarked Jabez in a very warlike
tone, “ produce yer derned warrant! ”
“We act,” I replied with dignity, “by summary
jurisdiction in nisi prills sine die. Assistant pur-
suivant, bring up your prisoner. ”
When they were on deck I gave the word of
command —“Draw truncheons!” and our clubs
flashed from their scabbards. The sight of the
Royal Arms on the truncheons, and Stimson’s
uniform, did Snow’s business. He chewed briskly
for a minute, and then enquired—“ Wal, what’s
to pay, anyway ? ”
1 said we wouldn’t arrest him just then, if he’d
give parole and deliver to custody of the Court any
effects the prisoner, Parker, might have left on
board.
Said Jabez: “The skunk didn’t leave nary
stick nor stitch.”
Endeavoring to look terrible, I remarked :
“Jabez Snow, mariner ; if you do not immediately
deliver to the court the hundred pounds the
assassin Parker left with you yesterday, I’ll signal
yonder gunboat and have you arrested. Assistant
pursuivant, return with your prisoner to the boat
and prepare to board Her Majesty’s ship Snake.”
Jabez took a couple of turns and three ex-
pectorations : “Guess it’s got to go,” he said at
last. “Wait a bit ; I’ll get the money.” He
went below, returning after a time with a long
old netted silk purse with rings. The ends of the
purse were stuffed with sovereigns. I counted
fifty at each end, pocketed the purse, stepped to
the gangway and explained :
“Jabez Snow, attend the Supreme Court at
eleven to-morrow. Fail at your peril. ” I solemnly
added, as an afterthought, and desiring to be
impressive, “ Oh yes ! Oh yes ! Oh yes !”
As I went over the side Jabez murmured, soft
and low, “Ohno ! Oh no! Oh, dern my cats’ eyes,
no ! ”
* * * *
Next day, looking out on the harbor, we
were relieved, but not surprised, to find the Jabez
Snow gone. Then we told all men how we had
overlaid that cute commander. At night we
recounted the story, amended and improved, to a
full audience in the smoking-room. One by one
the audience went out. Stimson, Parker and I
were alone left. There entered a saturnine
stranger who, critically regarding us, walked up
and clapped handcuffs on Stimson and me while
we were wondering who he was.
“I’m detective Cowson,” he remarked, “and
I, arrest you two for obtaining money by false
pretences from one Jabez Snow.”
* * • *
How Parker worked Mr. Cowson we
never knew. But we were not locked up in gaol.
Lucre passed between Parker and the policeman--
£lOO, to be precise—Parker guaranteeing to keep
us locked up, in case of accident, till Saturday
night (it was then Thursday), when the Union
Company’s steamer left for Sydney. We were to
be placed aboard and detective Cowson engaged,
at tremendous peril to himself, as he insisted, to
put the other police off the scent. Parker hurried
us to that infernal box-room, and there we stayed,
without bedding, lights, or liquor, and with the
scanty food which Parker managed to abstract
from the table, so he said, for 48 hours. Parker
was very thoughtful, though. He frequently
communed with us through the keyhole, and, from
certain sounds, we sometimes fancied others were
there. We paid him back —he went to our rooms,
brought our purses —we gave him >£so each —the
£llOO bribe he had paid the detective. From about
noon on Saturday no one came near us. At eight
p.m. the landlord unlocked the door.
“ I’ve just received the key and this note from
Parker,” he said. “Parker left for Sydney by
the Tarawera, an hour ago.”
This was the note :
Yes, you’re smart, but not smart enough. The £lOO
you wild asses gave me for the sham detective will just
pay my Sydney flutter. Bless you, my children ! There’s
no need to keep your memory green! —Thine, Hieam
Abiff Parkbr.
The young fellow who brought the note re-
marked : “Just before the ship sailed your friend
flew into a great rage. He looked at an old-
fashioned purse he had full of what seemed sove-
reigns. When he examined them, he found all
but the three nearest the rings on each side rank
duffers. He said he’d lost <£94 by that deal. His
language was awful. ”
Stimson smiled a cold, cruel smile. The
poor Boston boy ! The <£so-note he took out «
my box was a forged one which I kept as a carlo
Jock M'Kenzie gave it to me. Good little fellow
Parker; but — young. , .
“ Where do I come in?” I said—' Ive losl
£5O ! ”
“ You’re a Britisher. Britishers don t come 1%
with the great American nation. ”
J. ESISON.
STARVED IN MUTINY
A FAMOUS mutiny on shipboard came to pass in
this way : When the ship, which had sailed from
London, was well down the Channel, it was found
that the provisions intended for the use of the
crew were rotten and, of course, uneatable. 1 he
men complained to the captain, who promised to
put into some near p®rt, and exchange the bad
stores for good. He failed to keep his word, and
as the poor sailors couldn’t sail the ship 10,000
miles on empty stomachs they killed the captain
and mate, helped themselves to the cabin pro-
visions, held high jinks for a few weeks, and finally
scuttled the ship, put off in the boats, and were
all lost but three. The captain could have pre-
vented all this if he had chosen to; but perhaps
the owners and he had put up the bad job on the
men. Very likely, and got served out for it.
They were both criminals and fools.
But there are ships that must needs sail to the
end of the voyage with only the original stores.
Come what may, they can’t go back or put into
any port. Some are well found and others badly;
and so voyages differ. . i
To modify the illustration, the latter kind of
vessels are human beings. At birth we sail on a
voyage, which by rights ought to be seventy years
long. But how many of us continue on the Sea
of Life that long ? Very few, comparatively.
Most of us go down sooner. Why ? Because we
recklessly, carelessly, or ignorantly waste the stock
of vital force with which Nature endows us at the
start. There are no meat shops or bakeries on the
Atlantic, nor are there any places after birth
where we can beg or buy more “life.” < This is
perfectly plain to me. Is it plain to you ? I am
afraid it isn’t. Let’s see whether a little incident
will throw light on it.
Mr. Henry Fish had been a fortunate man. His
forbears had done well by him. Up to the
autumn of 1890 he could say, “ I have always
been strong and healthy. ” For 30 years he had
worked as a painter for one employer. He
must have been not only a healthy man, but
a good painter. So far his “ vitality,” his
constitution had been equal to all demands on
it. It had endured a lot of hard work, resisted
the weather, and digested his food. Then it
refused to go on. It struck work. It wouldn’t
make sail or pull an oar. In plain English,
the symptoms or signs of the trouble weie these :
Loss "of appetite, bad taste in the mouth, terrible
pains after eating, yellow eyes and skin, and
rheumatic gout in the feet. His legs and stomach
became fearfully swollen, and his heart palpitated
and thumped frightfully nearly all the time. On
account of the distress given him by solid food he
could only eat slops, and not much strength can
be got out of them.
By-and-by the best he could do was to hobble
about on crutches. He could not lie abed at all,
because he couldn’t draw his breath when lying
down. For over a month he snatched what sleep
he could when supported upright on his crutches.
Just think of that, and be thankful it wasn’t your
case. He wasn’t able to lift his hand to his mouth,
and had to be nursed night and day. He got so
low (in spite of doctors attending him) that he
didn’t expect to live, and didn’t desire to. One
doctor said he had heart disease,; and that his
heart was big as a bullock’s, which was nonsense.
During all this illness Mr. Fish had a professional
nurse from a convalescent home. When he had
sunk so low as to make it a wonder limy lie kept
alive at all, he first heard of the medicine which
finally cured him. In concluding his letter he
says : “ After beginning to take Mother Seigel’s
Curative Syrup I never looked behind me. I got
stronger every day, and have ailed nothing since.
This medicine saved my life, and I want the public
to know it. (Signed) Henry Fish, Great Malverp,
County of Worcester, January 12th, 1893.”
Only a word more. We ppoke of men and
women being like ships that have to sail to the end
of the voyage with what supplies they start with.
By that we mean, not supplies of food, but supply
of power to digest food. You see the difference?
Bread and butter are no better than lead and
leather if you can’t digest them. In Mr. Fish’s
case it was not food that failed, but power to use
it. He had indigestion and dyspepsia. The
wonderful remedy discovered by Mother Seigel
stopped the waste of vitality caused by the
disease, and enabled Nature to use food to build
up the perishing body. He will now proceed, we .
hope, towards the port of Old Age, with favoring
winds.
Yet, save for timely rescue, he would doubtless
have gone down, as millions do, leaving but a
momentary eddy over the spot where they
disappear.

tinctive Australian National Polity.

A Universal System of Compulsory Life

The entire Abolition of the Private Owner-

The Referendum.
The Abolition of Titles of so-called “nobility.
The public eye rejects as uninteresting more-
than half of what appears in the newspapers of
the day. It is only the remainder that is found
in The Bulletin.
The Bulletin is an aggressive Democratic
paper which strives to exclude from its artisti-
cally-condensed columns all matter that is not
of general human interest. The Bulletin was
started 13 years ago with no capital but brains,
and has become the representative Australian
journal, because it possesses a vitality lacked
by the countless newspaper-ventures in which
Australian capitalists have unavailingly spent
arge fortunes.
The Bulletin's conductors claim that every
progressive paper on the Australian continent has
more or less endeavoured to profit by its example'
and follow its lines. The result of its powerful
influence and its unprecedented literary and com-
mercial success can at once be seen by comparing
the methods pursued by the Australian daily and
weekly press prior to and immediately after th
first issue of The Bulletin.
I rom the date of The Bulletin's inaugural
publication its success was assured. It had at
once a dozen more or less servile imitators, many
of even took, so far as was possible, its
name. They are now all dead, while The Bul-
letin continues the one phenomenal success in
Australian journalism, the one completely non-
local and distinctly uni versal Australasian news-
paper.
The Bulletin proprietary have spent some
thousands of pounds in fitting their buildings
with the latest appliances for high-class printing
and the production of illustrations, and they have
now issued The Bulletin in an entirely new
form—printed with new type of improved legi-
bility on the finest paper, and adorned with
sketches from the hands of the ablest and best-
paid newspaper artists Australia has ever seen.
The Bulletin is the only well-established Aus-
tralian journal which, throughout its career, has
been consistently Radical, it points with pride
to the fact that for years it stood alone among
secular newspapers in advocating the Irish
National Cause, and that it was the only Aus-
tralian journal which denounced the Soudan
Expedition from its inception.
The Bulletin is the beacon-fire of national
progress : it is the forceful summons to the
crusade against the monopolies in land, wealth,
power, and privilege—the direct cause of half the
misery which now afflicts British humanity.
Against the cl a 1 ms of avaricious clergy who claim
to monopolise salvation, aerainst the dark despotism
of grasping plutocrats, and against the exercise of
any human authority which has not been granted
by the people over whom it is exercised, The
Bulletin will fearlessly and ruthlessly contend.
The Bulletin, unlike the ordinary weekly
journal, is not loaded with a weight of matter
transferred from the columns of a daily paper
issued from the same office. The Bulletin is
not connected with any other paper, and the
matter it contains is all specially prepared by its
own unequalled staff.
The Bulletin is the journal which, of all Aus-
tralian journals, is most frequently quoted in Eng-
land, America, and the colonies.
The Bulletin, which is the only paper sold
by runners in the streets of everv Australasian
capital, is the most widely-circulated of all paper*
published south of the equator, and is the only
Australasian publication which enjoys a popu-
larity unhampered by the political boundaries
that so closely restrict other journals to the
colonies in which they are printed.
The Bulletin’s red cover is equally familiar
to the bushman of the Far North, the stockman
of Central Australia, the pearl-sheller of Torres
Straits, and the digger in the Maoriland
Ranges. A paper which is at once the most
popular city publication and the organ of the
intelligent bushman must indeed be broadly based.
Perhaps the strongest proof of The Bulletin’s
popularity is found in the unchallengeable fact—
easily ascertainable from any postal official that
of all journals issued in Australasia, The Bul-
letin is the one most frequentlv remailed from
one reader to another.
The Bulletin is going ahead faster than and
other paper, because its vast mass of original and
specially- written reading matter is the brightest
and best, its illustrations the cleverest and most
artistic, and its policy the boldest and most
straightforward ever submitted to the Australian
public.
