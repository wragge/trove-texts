A Philosophy of Stage Clothes
In the production of a play the public
demands conformity to its own standard of
knowledge with regard to the dress of the
period in which the events of the drama have
been placed by its author. Its knowledge is
popular, rudimentary and traditional, but
will not allow, as a rule, such anachronisms
as, say, Julius Caesar in a frock-coat and
silk hat seated a.t the head of the Roman
Senate in morning-coats, creased trousers
and spats. It demands a Julius and a
Senate clad in that strange stage garment
which passes muster as a Roman toga. The
toga need not be an exact copy of that worn
on ceremonial occasions by the Roman
senator. Indeed, it would be difficult to be
exact in such a matter. It is only necessary
that the garment should be of the accepted
type; then no note of incongruity will be
struck, and the tragedy can proceed without
provoking roars of laughter.
Clothes very often make the period but
undo the actor. It is a difficult art to wear
unaccustomed garments as if they were one’s
own with pockets in them, and to be success-
ful in the art requires much practice, be-
sides a natural grace of carriage. Last week
I saw an experienced Shakspearean actor
playing Richard 111. at the Old Vic. On
the eve of the battle of Bosworth lie went
to bed very awkwardly in his full armor.
He had the air of a drunken reveller succumb-
ing to the evil effects of an artists’ ball.
Knowing the difficulty of being easy and
natural in costume, the modern producer
fights shy of a period-play and puts on
modern social drama or farce, where the
women wear the latest fashion in undress
and the men can appear in tweeds and
plus-fours by day and dinner-dress by night.
This is bad for the writer of chronicle plays
and the romantic drama. It limits his choice.
There are certain plays that must be pre-
sented. in costume; for instance, no one can
think of a Lady or Sir Peter Teazle except
in the elegantly picturesque dress of the
eighteenth century. “The School for Scan-
dal” is, of course, a comedy of manners of
that century of urbane immoralities. “A
Midsummer Night’s Dream” must always be
costumed as a fairy-play, whilst “Lear”, and
“Macbeth” deal so obviously with men of
primitive and barbaric times that the dress
must at any rate be symbolic of such days.
But what of plays written long ago dealing
with problems of the human soul which might
occur in any age or time’? Do nqt such
plays rather lose than gain in force by
being thrust upon us in the traditional fancy-
dress of the stage? Would it not be more
effective to surround their words with a
modern setting in order to convey to an
audience the enduring modernity of their
problems and ideas?
This is wlfat Sir Barry Vincent Jackson
has endeavored to do in his latest London
production of “Hamlet.”
In the first place, to what age or period
of European history does “Hamlet” belong?
Was he an Elizabethan or a prehistoric Dane
of the Dark Ages? Sliakspeare made no
effort to fix the period, and we may be sure
that in his time the tragedy was performed
in Elizabethan hose and doublet. Since the
Restoration the costumes of the play have
become fixed by tradition. They are a
welange of barbaric mediaeval uniforms and
Elizabethan garments. Except when per-
formed by a really well-trained company,
“Hamlet” has always had, for me, an air
of romantic unreality. Sir Barry Jackson’s
production is entirely modern. I was pre-
pared to be shocked with the pedants. At
first it is startling to hear the words so
crisply spoken; usually they are mouthed
or chanted as indistinctly as a strange tongue
by mummers in nondescript attire. The first
sentences come out of the cold darkness of
the night upon the battlements of Elsinore.
The men who speak them are cloaked and
muffled against the eager air. The unquiet
ghost, though very audible later on, is
scarcely visible ; he is in fact the one charac-
ter in the play who never seems quite
modern.
The court scene is admirably done. It is
of this warm world of to-day. Claudius, the
king, is a distinguished and dignified gentle-
man in full evening-dress, with glittering
orders across his white shirt-front. His
mere appearance provides an excuse for
Gertrude’s frailty. The Queeoi looks the
sensuous creature she is, living on the bright
surface of life and entertaining her guests
with the grace of a freethinking duchess of
Mayfair. Polonius is very modesrn. He is
fussy and officious, a very tedious old fool,
fatuous in manner. He has the tempera-
ment of a flunkey in a royal court, and is
singularly up-to-date. Hamlet isi a gloomy
youth from the University, suffering badly
from an overdose of introspective '’philosophy
and unable to control his own ,complexes.
His mind is too prolific in imagery. His
ideals, born in the unreal atmospjhere of a
publics school and University, Wave been
shattered by his mother’s hasty re-marriage.
The Prince is a marked contrast to the
level-headed, healthy Horatio arid' to the
impetuous, swiftly-moving Laertejs. They
are three distinct types of modern youth.
To them must/be added Osric, the “water-fly,”
in the latest Oxford trousers.
One of the, delightful scenes is '.the; unex-
pected arrival s of the strolling playerti at Elsi-
nore. They arte evidently a repertory %company
on tour. They are ultra-modern. The star of
the company is asttired in plus-fours and
patterned stockings. He is an athletic figure,
and might be 1 - a member of Sir Frank Ben-
son’s sporting, Thespian brotherhood. The
ladies are smartly dressed and shingled,
whilst the professional comic is fat and
Jewish. The; play within the play, ’“The
Mousetrap,” is givfcn upon a stage within
the stage in full ’ viepv of the auditorium. Its
characters are dressed in the traditional
stage style in sharp contrast to the main
dramatis pei'somw, who enter and sit with
their backs to tjhe audience, so that \re feel
that we are at the royal command-pcjrform-
ance and, being,fin (Hamlet’s secret, w'e wait
for the result «upon the nerve-cenfires of
Claudius. *
One of the triumphs of the production is
the gravediggers’ scene. We had come to
regard its humor as stilted and threadbare,
as something which is a mere archaeological
survival of fun, as text-book humor. The
modern dress of the clowns and the dry,
crisp utterance of the words dispelled .the
mustiness of the jokes. The grave-diggers
are a delightful pair of Gabriel Grubbs who
can joke in the medium of their employment.
The sly, cynical humor of the leader is alive.
It is his own philosophy of life and death
breaking into words.
The keynote of such a production is life.
The settings are simple and yet sufficient.
The attention of the audience is centred upon
the characters, tlfeir actions and their utter-
ances. Such a production is only possible
with a company of players whose training
is almost perfect, who speak their lines so
that a modern audience can understand the
significance of every word and phrase. A
success of this kind opens up a whole vista
of possibilities. If simplicity of production
is adopted, the stage may yet be saved from
the cluttering rubbish that has obscured the
true nature of the drama and converted it
into an exhibition of glittering scenery and
spectacular stunts to please the vulgar and
the curious Philistines. The stage may yet
become the most universal medium for the
conveyance of ideas and emotions through
words and actions freed from the bonds of
enterprising commercialism.
FRANCIS JACKSON.
The Exile of Erin
The half-hearted effort at defence of the
Scottish traditional view of Robert Burns —
or. to be more correct, Robert O'Byrne—-
antlior of “Tam o' Slianter” and some of the
sweetest lyrics of any land, makes it almost
unnecessary to add anything to my original
statement. One Scotchman has already
thrown in the towel, and, being unable to
defend the Scotch position, takes the short-
cut of declaring that Burns is no poet. Since
Sir Walter Scott has fallen from fame —the
oaks he planted having outlasted his laurels,
as he himself predicted—'Scotland, with the
possible exception of R.L.S., whose Irish
descent is well known, can point to no
Scotchman who has reached anything like
front rank in literature. The obvious course
for Scotchmen is to declare that literature
is not worth while, and fall back upon the
great national art of hoarding bawbees.
But to trace the course of the Byrne
family to Scotland is by no means difficult,
and is in itself full of interest. “The Book
of the O’Byrnes,” now preserved in the
library of Trinity College, Dublin, is proof
of the tremendous esteem in which the Byrne
family was held by the bards of Ireland
for several centuries. They were the direct,
patrons of literature when even the Fitz-
geralds, Cavanaghs and O’Moores were
“afraid to buy a poem” ; and they were
among the last who held out against Eng-
lish rule. Their two homes were in the.
Wicklow Mountains and at Ranelagh, near
Dublin: and about the end of the 16th
century things went heavily against them.
Rose O’Byrne—-the woman most famous for
her grace and beauty in all Ireland —was
burned by the English in 1695. She was the
wife of Fiach O’Byrne, who, with the O
dropped from his name, took shelter at Fiu-
nard, in County Down, in the early years of
James I. The family remained in many
branches near Dublin ; and the Byrnes were
still noted literary enthusiasts at the close of
the eighteenth century, when the name appears
times in the subscription list to the first
edition of O’Conor’s “History of Ireland,”
as against three Fitzgeralds and three
Moores. In 1642, at the outbreak of the
English civil war, Fiach Byrne and his
family were living at Finnard. This may
have been the original Fiach or his son;
but the family was dispossessed of the hold-
ings-—to which it could have had no real
clan title—during the settlement of veterans
from the Parliamentary army in that dis-
trict. Probably Fiach had taken the wrong
side in the struggle; but this is not clear,
for a William Byrne—the Christian name is
illuminative —is found petitioning William
111. in 1693 for the return to the family
of the very lands previously occupied by
Fiach. The petitioner is found setting forth
his loyalty and, curiously enough, his Pro-
testantism, as claims for consideration ; and
the matter was referred to Sydney, Lord
Deputy, who apparently reported adversely,
for the Byrne family did not return to Fin-
nard. Instead, it is found settled on a small
and unprofitable farm near Cushendall —
famed for its ponies—in northern Ant-
rim, where one of its members acquired a
local fame as a writer of verse. Hugh
Byrne was the author of many ridiculous
political lampoons in bad verse and w’orse
taste and of some other scraps of rhyme
which have been preserved. The proof of
his connection with Finnard is found in his
mention of that place as his former home
in a doggerel ballad called “The Poor Potato
Digger,” which Father Donovan quotes in
his “Ulster Miscellany” (Christie, Dublin,
1823) . It was William, the younger brother
of Hugh, who went to Scotland about the
middle of the eighteenth century. There can
be no real doubt about either his new place
of abode or his identity ; for once more Father
Donovan’s book comes to the rescue with a
quotation
My brother Billy’s o’er the water
Where lie must be a man of Air,
While 1 grow flax to take and barter
For a sow at Ballymena fair.
The good Father had no knowledge of the
fact that he was forming important historical
links or that “brother Billy’s” Son was to be
the greatest lyric poet of a generation.
There is no proof that William Byrne
said he came from the Highlands. The Irish
origin may have been a family secret well
known to his son Robert, who may even have
been fed from infancy on remembered scraps
of Irish literature. 1 )r. Douglas Hyde, writ-
ing with no thought of this controversy,
pointed out 30 years ago (“Literary History
of Ireland,” page 534) that the verse-forms
which Burns uses in Scotcli-English are
often identical with old classic forms of Irish

Gaelic. He quoted one stanza which was a
true rannaigheaeht mor quatrain. It 18
ficult to think that this was due to accident
or the working of the sub-conscious mind.
To sum up: Robert Burns even in form
and feature was Irish ; his virtues and
were alike true to his Irish ancestij , ■_
mode of thinking was Irish; his verse-form,
are frequently Irish; liis spirit is not on \
Irish, but in direct antithesis to everything
Scotch; and every link in the chain ot tain
history is complete. Scotland can claim t\\
things only: his birth and the dialect •
used. When he went from the plough to
mingle in Edinburgh society he bore liimse
like a courtier —in fact, just as a desccnda
of the Fiach O’Byrne who had courted the
lovely Lady Rose two centuries earlier img lit
have been expected to bear himself. IN atm-
ally Edinburgh wrs surprised; for to any
other Scotch ploughman the clods of earth
cling permanently and make heavy marks
on the drawing-room carpet 50 years after
he has left the paddock. And it anything
more could be wanted to show the poverty
of the Scotch claim to Robert Burns it is
the certainty that his good taste would re-
coil in absolute horror from the blatant brag
and bombast of every national feast that is
held in his alleged honor.
C. O. M.
Moreton Bay
In Morcton. Bay Settlement, W. W. Craig,
of Brisbane (Watson, Ferguson and Co.),
early days of struggle and strife that led
to the founding of the present magnificent
State of Queensland.
The real opener-up of the Moreton Bay
country and of the river flowing through it
was Oxley, to whom much space is rightly
devoted. Oxley’s labors were much light-
ened by the discovery of several shipwrecked
men among the blacks, whose aid was in-
valuable. These castaways paid a high tri-
bute to the humanity and kindness shown
them by the much-abused aboriginals among
whom they were flung. On the other hand,
the blacks further north (Wide Bay) were
reputed to be cruel and barbarous, a char-
acter they did much to deserve both then and
in days to come. Commandant Logan was,
however, the real beginner of the foundations
of the settlement. In company with Major
Lockyer he did much towards mapping the
country in the Brisbane basin. One extra-
ordinary notion held by these explorers was
that the tremendous floods that took place
in the Brisbane were due to the swamp at
Bathurst overflowing and swelling the lower
reaches of that river. Logan disappeared on
his last excursion to investigate such pro-
blems, and the mystery of his end has never
been cleared up. The true nature of the
basin was not understood till Allan Cunning-
ham discovered the Darling Downs and the
cup-like depression that broke through the
maritime range separating the Downs from
the coastal country. Then followed the open-
ing-up of the Downs —a development that had
a marvellous effect on the fortunes of the
country.
The original Moreton Bay settlement was
of course penal, and one of its features was
a huge treadmill for grinding corn worked
by prisoners. “They feel it very irksome
at first,” says the old record, “16 men being
kept at it 14 hours at a time.” Irksome?
Probably—probably!
Then men went further afield. Major
Cotton and Andrew Petrie did much work of
this pioneering character, and Stuart Russell
pushed ahead into the Wide Bay district.
That indomitable battler Patrick Leslie was
the first to “sit down” in the country west of
the range—a development made possible
by the discovery of the Gap that rendered
Brisbane accessible for the Downs country.
No land within the 50-mile limit of Brisbane
could be thrown open prior to 1842. Such
restriction not applying to the Downs, settle-
ment was rapid in that district, and this pro-
gress had a profound influence on the rest
of the colony.
The struggles on the transportation ques-
tion soon loomed up. Sturdy old Dr. Lang
stood for free labor, or, rather, for a free
farming industry, and conducted a bitter war-
fare with Leslie. Much of the convict labor
wms undoubtedly, as the latter asserted, very
efficient and highly prized. “Exiles” was the
euphemism used by Leslie in alluding to con-
victs. Even in those days controversialists
could get very acrimonious. Leslie remarked
that he was not an admirer of Dr. Lang,
Whereupon the doctor: “He does not like
me, forsooth! I should be sorry if he did.”
Lang’s great coup was the introduction of
some 600 immigrants by three vessels into
Brisbane, an enterprise that left an indelible
mark on the story of that city.
Interesting also is the story of Colonel
Barney’s landing at Pt. Curtis. His vessel
ran on a shoal, thus nullifying all the pre-
parations for a landing in style—“full uni-
form” and “proper blowing of trumpets.” To
be noted also that the Sydney Government
was not without ulterior motives in wanting
to set up a new possible capital so far north,
there being a certain fear of rivalry of a
new and flourishing centre as close as More-
ton Bay! But the Pt. Curtis venture failed,
and Brisbane commenced to grow and grow.
Meantime explorers kept pushing out. Bur-
nett opened up the country on the fine river
that bears his name, and Kennedy met his
death while exploring the far north-eastern
coast-line.
Next a brisk and somewhat amusing con-
test for the honor of being the capital
took place between Brisbane, Cleveland and
Ipswich. Governor Gipps himself came
up to adjudicate, but struck Cleveland at
low tide and had to wade through mud and
shallows to reach the shore. Fitzroy also
was unfortunate at the same place, and
gradually the contest centred round Brisbane
(North and South) and Ipswich. Meantime
the movement for autonomy had been grow-
ing, and finally a specific motion by Dr.
Lang in Parliament in favor of Separation
was defeated by “a majority of 16 out of
30 votes.” Stuart Russell seconded this
motion, and of course Patrick Leslie had
to oppose it. Both Governor Fitzroy and
Governor Denison were hostile, but finally
her Majesty’s Government heeded the re-
peated meetings and petitions of Moreton
Bay. Sir George Bowen arrived as first
Governor on December 10. 1859.
In the engrossing references to the abo.
inhabitants, a number of their amiable
customs are mentioned. Thus it is noted
that the Moreton Bay aborigines, after a
tribal battle, took away the bodies of their
deceased friends and relatives and ate them.
That, no doubt, was common enough; but
with these people the skin of the deceased
was removed and preserved as a relic, some
magic property against disease being sup-
posed to inhere therein.
The book fills a blank that has long been
crying to be filled; altogether too little
attention has been devoted by Australian
writers to the rise and progress of the most
fertile and promising State in Australia.
The title might, however, be amended with
advantage. “Moreton Bay” does not con-
vey an adequate idea of the book’s scope
and value.

Pity the Poor Publisher
By Christmas Eve London will have seen
within three months the publication of 5000
now books. This fact is an index to the
extent of a publisher’s activities, but by no
means of his prosperity. A majority of
these works can scarcely hope to pay ex-
penses, and most of them will be quickly
relegated to the “new remainder’’ counters
and to second-hand bookshops. Few book-
publishers die rich men—the term in this
and ensuing statements does not include
those whose main interests are magazines
and newspapers. No other tradesman car-
ries anything like so large a percentage of
losing lines. Very few first-novels —indis-
pensable to an ambitious firm —yield any
profit. Advertising on a considerable scale
is absolutely necessary. An average sale
for a first-novel (now published at 7s. 6d.
net) would be about 500 copies. A 10 per
cent, royalty yields the author £lB 15s. —
a poor enough reward for writing 60,000
words. Sold to the trade in single copies
at 6s. 3d. (13 copies to count as 12), the
turnover is about £l5O. From this must be
deducted the cost of printing 1000 or 1500
copies, the author's royalties, about £25 for
advertising and 15 per cent, for office
expenses. It is exceptional for an author to
strike immediate success; but he receives a
certain standing as the author of a book, and
more easily finds acceptance for short stories
and articles. With a third book it is fairly
clear to the publisher whether or not the
author stands a chance of making headway.
Often he speculates large sums in advertising
a new man. Thus the attention of literary
agents and other publishers is attracted;
and, with the spade-work done, one of these
may snap up the rising writer, whose origi-
nal benefactor is left lamenting. But the
author is wise to stick to one firm, for if
it is confident of his loyalty it will as a
rule spare neither pains nor pennies to boom
his work. William .1. Locke wrote eight
novels without achieving a real success;
with the ninth, “The Morals of Marcus
Ordoyne,” and the tenth, “The Beloved Vaga-
bond,” he made thousands of pounds. Authors
are needy people, and constantly clamor for
payment in advance —-sometimes before they
have written one line of a long work.
Few publishers have not paid many hun-
dreds of pounds for work which has never
been written —sometimes, however, written
and paid for a second time and issued by an-
other firm. Yet, for reasons of prudence
and popularity, prosecution never follows.
Another difficult point is reached when the
first edition of a moderatelv-popular novel is
exhausted. By the time that a second edi-
tion is prepared, the market for it may
have completely dropped—this may happen
within two or three weeks —and another 1000
or 1500 copies may have been printed at a
dead loss. Yet if the new edition were not
produced the author would naturally feel
that he was not being given a fair chance.
Some authors are hurt by kindness. Two
such instances occurred at the Bodley Head.
John Lane was immensely struck with “Wid-
dicombe.” a West Country novel by Miss
M. P. Willcocks, an intellectual predecessor
of Sheila Kaye Smith. When Miss Will-
cocks completed “The Wingless Victory”
Lane advertised it enormously, thrust it
upon newspaper critics and won big orders
from booksellers, who, in their turn, were
for their own sakes obliged to do their
utmost for the book. But they found they
had ordered too extensively, and when the
author’s next book, “A Man of Genius,”
appeared, booksellers were cautious and
critics lukewarm. Miss Willcocks never re-
covered from that reaction. A similar inci-
dent occurred with Charles Marriott’s “The
Column.” Over-insistence by the publisher
on the merits of the work gave the author a
reputation that he could not sustain. Lane
did infinitely more successful work on similar
lines for Stephen Phillips, for he laid siege
to Beerbohm Tree at His Majesty's Theatre
and George Alexander at St. James’s until
he could induce them to produce “Herod”
and “Paolo and Francesca.” The four prin-
cipals all made thousands from these plays.
About 15 years ago publishers came to
an agreement whereby a MS. by a new
author would be accepted only on the
author’s pledge to offer the publisher the
first refusal of the next four or five books
from the same pen. Higher royalties and
gradually increasing advances were indi-
cated. In this way a publisher was ap-
parently protected, so that an early success
would not allow a rising young author to
be snared away from the firm of his adop-
tion. These agreements have been fre-
quently broken, yet in no case has a
publisher taken his cause of action to court.
Printers and binders are in a much safer
position than those for whom they work;
they receive definite orders. Certainly the
publisher may make an infinitely greater
profit from an individual book, but it is
all a gamble; favorites go down or win at
ridiculously short prices, and outside chances
upset logical calculations. There is a risk,
too, of libel actions. “The New Macliia-
velli,” by H. G. Wells, which satirised in very
thin disguise his old Fabian comrades, was
refused by six or seven publishers from fear
of libel action before Lane took a sporting
(and very successful) risk, advancing Wells
£lOOO on account of royalties. Finally, it
would surprise many people to know how
many MSS. have to be carefully revised—
often re-written— by expert “readers” be-
fore they see print; and that also means
heavy expense.
In spite of the tremendous output of
fiction, any good novel to-day is reasonably
sure of acceptance by one publisher or an-
other, and that it is swamped in the flood
of new novels seldom deters its acceptors
from courting further failures. Naturally
many MSS. have been refused again and
again, ultimately to become financial suc-
cesses. But these are only so many romantic
items among hundreds of thousands. Georg**
Meredith refused "East Lynne” on behalf
of Chapman and Hall, roundly abusing Levi-
son as a stick and Lady Isabel as a “blotched
fool.” Probably not six London publishers
to-day could immediately meet their liabili-
ties. Many are heavily indebted to printers
and binders, while heavy advances to authors
over long periods leave them constantly short
of ready money.
ARUNDEL DENE.
William Pember Reeves
William Pember Reeves is back in Maori-
land, and one can easily believe him when
he describes the joy with which, after MO
years, he saw from the deck of the Niagara
the blue on the hills of home. Rooking over
Auckland from the top of Maungakiekie, and
noting, as a sign of a high standard of living,
the thousands of garden-enclosed homes, the
framer of the factory and arbitration legis-
lation of the ’nineties could say that he had
had a share in promoting this prosperity,
lie has, however, another claim upon the re-
membrance of Maorilanders. He is their
leading man of letters, and no native-born
has written so felicitously of their history
and the beauties of their country. Reeves
is most versatile. As Maori land's first Minis-
ter of Labor his fame is secure in the history
of politics. From Seddon’s Ministry he went
to London as Agent-General, and afterwards
became head of the London School of Eco-
nomics. As chairman of the National Bank
he is now inquiring into conditions in Maori-
land. “The Long White Cloud” is not only
a reliable history of the country, but the
most readable book on the subject. It has
the graces of a man who is steeped in culture
and has a fastidious sense of style. Had he
given himself entirely to literature, he might
have made a much greater reputation as
historian, publicist or poet. His writing,
however, has been done in the scanty leisure
of a busy life, and his fastidiousness has
helped to restrict his output. He has a
rare poetic gift, but all his verses would
go into a volume of moderate sine. It
is characteristic of him that in his new
volume of verse, privately printed, like the
one issued nearly 20 years ago. he has made
extensive alterations in some of his best-
known works. In the oft-quoted “New Zea-
land,” for example, the last verse is almost
new.
Peaks piercing the silence of Heaven,
Snows gleaming in luminous space,
See her waves round a hemisphere driven
Fling their crests to the winds as they race;
And the stars watch her lamp newly lighted
And its beams shot afar'o’er the sea ;
With the light of old wrongs at length righted
By men who are free.
Not a line remains the same. In the much
liner “Passing of the Forest,” one of the
most beautiful of Maoriland poems, there
are many changes. In the new edition of
“The Long White Cloud” he revised his
previous work, but lie commissioned another
hand to write the history of the last two
decades. What gives this book and his
"State Experiments in Australia and Maori-
land” a special value is that they are written
by a man who is at once a scholar, an
economist and a statesman, and took a
leading part in many of the events described.
Hooks on sociology are apt to be dull.
"State Experiments” is never dull. All
through there is not only acute observation,
but style. The chapter on shop legislation
is all the better for the picture of the
country store with its leisurely trading and
its atmosphere of “mingled odors of cheese,
American apples, moleskins, bacon, brown-
sugar and boots.” It is melancholy to think
that in the Maoriland Parliament to-day
there is no one with similar gifts. Downie
Stewart has some reputation as a writer,
but he lacks Reeves’s grace, and he is not
a poet. Reeves’s admirers are wondering
whether at the age of OS he will be moved
to write more by the smell of tussock and
the sight of the Alps at the end of Christ-
church streets —“like Heaven at the end of
long, plain lives.”

The Lost. Sword of Shamyl, by Lewis Stanton
Palen (John Lane). Born at the close of the
eighteenth centurv, a weakling child of a dissolute
father, Shamyl lifted himself into prominence as a
blade of the Moslem faith. His military campaigns
in defence of the Caucasus against the Russians have
passed into history and been woven into song. At
last a t tiwnib, in the summer of 1859, he was
brought to bay by the Russian general Prince Bana-
tinsky, to whom he handed over his sword. The
Prince subsequently gave the weapon to the grand-
father of “The White Devil,” a Russian aristocrat,
who played an adventurous rOle during the Bol-
shevik revolution. In January, 1918, the Unite
Devil was condemned to be executed, and the sword
taken from him was the famous sword of Shamyl.
The book has been written in collaboration with
Ossendowski, the author of “Beasts, Men and Gods, ’
a fact which will add considerably to its interest
for all readers of that remarkable work.
Doctor Doolittle's Circus, by Hugh Lofting
(Jonathan Cape). Probably the most interesting fig-
ure to appear in the realm of childish romance since
Alice followed the white rabbit into Wonderland is
Doctor Doolittle, whose extraordinary knowledge of
the speech and ways of animals leads to countless
adventures dear to young hearts. Doolittle has done
a great deal of work since he first supplied the old
draught-horse with green spectacles and borrowed
the sailor’s ship to go to Africa ; but, unlike most
heroes of the sort, he continues as simple, fresh and
attractive in each new book as in the one which
went before it. This one might easily be regarded
as the best of the series. There is rather more than
the usual adventure, a lot of quiet fun —some will
strike the elders without being missed by the child-
ren—and the touches of philosophy are often de-
lightful. The humor is all of the seemingly un-
conscious sort; birds, beasts and men are natural,
direct and convincing; and even the good doctor
standing in the midst of the hunt with his pockets
bulging with young foxes and borrowing a guinea'
from the master of the hounds is a picture in keep-
ing with the rest. The illustrations are from the
author’s own pen —just the sort of drawings a child
ought to make if he could picture his own thoughts
Without being too clever about it.


ACK
A Good
Rarely in manufacturing history has a name entrenched itself so firmly
in the confidence of the entire world as the name Dodge Brothers.
Everywhere and to everyone this name means but one thing: a prod-
uct built honestly of the best available materials and sold at a just price.
Behind this product, this price and this enviable reputation lie certain
impressive and fundamental facts.
So important is a knowledge of these facts to the motor car buyer that
Dodge Brothers, Inc., have determined to publish them, from time to
time, until every newspaper reader in the world may be presumed
to have read them:
Dodge Brothers, during the past
eleven years, have built and sold
more than one million four hun-
dred thousand motor cars—and
more than 90% of these cars
are still in service. This record
requires no comment It stands
impressively alone in motor car
history.
It has never been Dodge Bro-
thers policy to build yearly
models. When an improve-
ment, that is really an im-
provement, is discovered, it is
made at once . Their slogan,
“Constantly Improved But No
Yearly Models 8 ’ is familiar the
world over.
Dodge Brothers build one chas-
sis and only one. This policy
materially lowers manufactur-
ing cost. It also enables Dodge
Brothers engineers to concen-
trate their entire time and
thought on the betterment of
this one type.
Dodge Brothers have never had
an “off year” or an “off car.”
This is because they have never
used the public as a testing
ground for “new models’’ or
lowered the quality of their
product in the slightest degree.
Every change has been an im-
provement on the original
design.
Dodge Brothers pioneered in
building the first all-steel open
car and the first all-steel closed
car. These epochal develop-
ments have saved Dodge Bro-
thers owners many millions of
dollars by materially prolong-
ing motor car life and by effect-
ing marked economies in man-
ufacture. This construction has
also reduced incalculably the
danger from accident and fire.
Dodge Brothers sell directly
through their dealers to the
purchaser. There are no sec-
tional distributing agencies to
increase the cost of distribution
and the cost of the car.
Dodge Brothers have never
given so-called “free service.’*
The car is sold at a fair and
honest price. Nothing is added
by the manufacturer to this
original purchase price to pay
for service that the owner may
never need.
Dodge Brothers Dealers were
pioneers in adopting the flat
rate service system. By this
system, the owner knows in
advance what any service job
will cost. There are no unpleas-
ant surprises in his bills.
The sturdiness and long life of
Dodge Brothers Motor Car
is reflected in its resale value.
Comparatively few Dodge
Brothers Motor Cars are ad-
vertised in the resale columns
of the newspapers. The values
they bring testify unanswerably
to their goodness—and the
public’s belief in their goodness.
The time has passed when transient novelties can lead a though tful
buyer to overlook the great essentials of motor car worth. A few of
these essentials, outlined above, go far to explain why Dodge Brothers
name is accepted, the world over, as the hall mark of dollar-for-dollar value.

largest individually owned and operated business building in the
world, symbolizes the strength of General Motors, with its resources

What makes motor car value?
12* Permanence
IVtoRE than ever people ask before
purchasing a motor car or truck: "Is the
company which builds it permanent?”
Experience has shown that when a
make of motor vehicle is discontinued,
the existing models immediately lose
in value because of the difficulty of
obtaining parts and service.
Buick, Cadillac, Chevrolet, Oakland,
Oldsmobile and the GMC Truck are
made by companies which are strong
in themselves. Each has a long suc-
cessful record extending back to the
beginning of the industry. And, as
divisions of General Motors, their per-
manence is doubly assured by reason
of the great resources and financial
strength of the parent organization.
General Motors cars are recognized
as value standards in each price class.

VARIOUS VERSE
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
The Cycle.
[Queen Mab of fairy lore has been shown to be
Queen Maeve of Irish legend.]
The woods are gracious in the spring
And merry in the summer;
And pleasure has a dower to ding
To every gay newcomer.
But old and very old are they
Who own these storied glades,
Where laughters low run to and fro
Among the tall grass-blades.
There was a woman of the world
Whose reign has never ended,
A queen who saw the dags unfurled
In battle pageant splendid,
Who on her milk-white stallion set
Caused stern men’s hearts to know
The splendid pride that like a tide
O’erwlielms both friend and foe.
Where “faery Mab the junkets ate”
Who saw the white queen going
Amid her star-eyed lords of State,
The horns about her blowing V
She passes far from Irish earth
And holds a wider reign—
A laughing maid who cannot fade,
With Milton in her train :
And who may say what years will bring
As changing seasons mellow?
Will Shakspeare be a woodland thing,
Some dimpled, laughing fellow
Made half of leaves and half of sun
And clothed in fancy’s pride,
While down the world with bags unfurled
The new Maeves bravely ride?
And which is false and which is true?
Bring forth the magic fiddle
And play the world’s white music through
In answer to the riddle.
There was a queen, there is a queen—
Time goes on flying feather —
Oh six years old, with hair of gold,
You're Mab and Maeve together!

A Dream of Summer.
Of stately queens, gold-browed,
Who walk among the bees
In warm spice-gardens far away
Croons the summer breeze,
Singing: “No hint of cloud
Athwart the lazy air
Darkens the noontide of Cathay,
Nor any storm is there!
“Under the thin jade moon
The scented nights are sweet
With the faint plucking of the lute
And soft, slow-dancing feet.
The swaying bamboos croon
By waters amber-pale;
But all the birds are stricken mute
To hear the nightingale.
“Then come, oh, come away!
The city gates stand wide;
The blue pagodas of the past
Will shelter you and hide.
There you who find the day
A burden, you who weep
Will find forgetfulness at last
In this the land of sleep!”
Of sleeping queens, still-browed.
At rest among the bees
In shadowed gardens far away
Croons the summer breeze,
Singing: “No hint of cloud
Darkens the drowsy air
With bitter memories in Cathay,
Nor any grief is there!”

December.
December lays her glowing hands in mine.
Her eyes are opals, but her hands are gold;
And whether she unwind through rain or
shine
Her threaded days she never can be cold.
She burns her fine grey dawns with yellow
flowers,
Warm white her cloud and silver light her
showers.
December at the doorway of the past
Raps with a hand that bears a magic ring.
Troop from the gates ajar all shrouded forms,
Each with a load of merchandise to bring.
One like a luscious dark-eyed houri goes,
Her yashmak fastened with a Persian rose.
One has sweet-oil in alabaster urns;
One carries in her burnished copper jar
The folded purples of a Syrian night,
Where probing fingers yet may find a star.
One brings within an ebon tube and small
Only a laugh that echoed through a wall!
And one has her small olive shoulder grooved,
Her slight form bending like a lily stem
With that bossed chest that makes such
burdening
In clash and click of many an uncut gem.
Behind her the black eunuch with no word
Fingers the gold hilt of the hidden sword.
Sometimes December shuts the magic door
And opens, near the ground, a little grate
Just wide enough to let the fairies through.
You hear their broken laughters as they
wait,
Rosy and frail, impatient, foolish things
With shoe-strings made of grass and petal
wings.
Or else she takes me by the eager hand
To old Romance within a Saxon wood.
That bark-brown gown Maid Marion enfolds,
That leaf-green jerkin cases Robin Hood;
Or, where thick mosses make a genie’s mat,
The Marquis struts behind his booted cat!
Through the more sterile months I some-
times hear
Jingle of bit and fret of stamping hoofs —
The Dream grown restless for December days
To blow the blossoms over dusty roofs
And set the wizard finger on the gate
Where new romance and inspiration wait!

THURSDAY, DECEMBER 24, 1925.
THE SPLIT HAIR OF JUSTICE.
The feeling wliich most prevailed in Aus-
tralia was one of surprise when a large and
learned High Court unanimously turned
Walsh and Johanson loose on the com-
munity, thereby creating the impression that
this is the kind of hotel which has no voice
in the selection of its guests. Even the dis-
charged men were surprised, or at least one
of them was. Then a certain impatience
supervened when it was found that the
large and learned Court, though rapid and
unanimous in deciding that the deportation
proceedings were null and void, required a
week in which to explain to itself and others
exactly why they were null and void. The
Federal Government, even if it had been a
swift Government, which it is not, couldn’t
begin to repair the hole in the law until it
knew what and where the hole was, and
meanwhile the insurrectionary policy which
Walsh and Johanson represent continued
active, and the spasmodic hold-up of the
shipping trade remained an unmitigated nui-
sance.
* ■» # *
When the country was informed why
it couldn’t rid itself of self-imported revolu-
tionaries the information proved to be less
informative, or at least less helpful, than
was hoped for in sanguine quarters, and
even less unanimous. It would appear that
some difficulties arise because of Magna
Charta, a document which was extracted by
violent rebels from a usurper, and which long
since went astray, though presumably authen-
tic copies are in existence. The Charter was
quoted to the effect that “no free man shall
be taken or imprisoned or exiled but by the
laic of the land.” As no one proposed to
exile Walsh and Johanson otherwise than
by the law r of the land, this chestnutty quo-
tation seemed pointless. It was further laid
down that section BAA of the Immigration
Act, passed by a Federal Legislature which
only came into existence in 1901, didn’t apply
to immigrants who were here before 1901,
and that they couldn't be deported, no matter
how disagreeable their actions might be after
1901. This might be taken to mean either
that the Immigration Act is amiss, or that
the Constitution leaves much to be desired,
or that logic isn't what it is cracked up to
be. Walsh made his initial appearance here
before 1901, while Johanson arrived later,
so this contention covers only half the
ground at best. Whether an immigrant who
arrived here before 1901 is exempt from
every form of penalty under Federal law for
the rest of his days, and can thus do what
he darned well likes in newly-acquired places
where there is none but Federal law, is an-
other question. Another allegation was that
the accused weren’t sufficiently informed of
the deeds laid to their charge; but sufficient
information is difficult to define, especially if
the person concerned is doing his best to
avoid information. The inevitable haze ot
doubt was thrown on item XXVII of Clause
51 in the Constitution. This gives the
Federal Parliament control of “immigration
and emigration.” It has been pleaded that
expulsion isn’t emigration, and that the
latter is, and must be, a voluntary act. How
the voluntary act of an individual can be
controlled by the State is left an open ques-
tion.
* * * *
The decision of the Court, whatever the
grounds upon which it was based, leaves the
Bruce Government with a clear field. There
being none of the Government’s forces left
on the field it couldn’t be clearer. The
smouldering and exasperating insurrection
had been in progress for about a year before
the long-suffering Ministry began to do any-
thing. It explained on many ocasions that
“Patience is not cowardice,” and the informa-
tion was not out of place. It was late and
slow in getting off the mark, and now. it is
back at the mark with failure, a bill of
costs and sundry writs for its pains. So
everything has. to be done afresh. One thing
needed is a drastic amendment of the Consti-
tution, but that is too slow a remedy to have
any immediate value. The document which
the learned Isaacs and Higgins helped to
create has these two drawbacks among
others. It specifies the powers of the Com-
monwealth and leaves the rest to the States,
instead of specifying the powers of the
States and leaving the rest to the Common-
wealth. Consequently, every time it is de-
monstrated that the Constitution-makers
had blundered again it is the Commonwealth
which loses prestige and sinks more deeply
into contempt. And, to aggravate the situa-
tion thus created, the assent of 66f per cent,
of the States is required before the smallest
blunder can be repaired. In the United
States an invisible fraction over 52 per
cent, is enough. If the N. Territory was
qualified as a State, or if N. S. Wales was
sawn in two, amendment would require the
assent of only 58 per cent, of the States, and
the way to repair would be easier.
* « * *
But, leaving amendment of the Constitution
temporarily out of the . question, there are
things to be done and things to be attempted,
unless the Cabinet has laid in another in-
definite supply of the patience which, the
community is assured, is not cowardice,
even if the resemblance is noticeable. The
most obvious move is the repeal of the
Navigation Act. Under that Act the Sea-
men’s Union has the sole right to furnish
men for Australian ships. . As it won t
furnish men, by reason of its slavish sub-
servience to imported people like . Walsh
and Johanson, the obvious thing is to let
others help in the business. As the hope of
losing these and similar nuisances is blighted
for the time being, even the mildest Prime
Minister whose patience was ever mistaken
for cold feet might realise that the next best
thing is to disarm them as far as possible,
and that this is disarmament. Something
vigorous might be done in the way of .mak-
ing it a very serious crime, as it is in
Britain and the United States, to preach, to
advocate in print or writing, or to plan and
organise, insurrection; and the Common-
wealth might provide itself with its own
criminal courts, police and gaols to prevent
borrowed State functionaries making a fool
of its law. If the High Court ruled that
the putting-down of insurrection, with all
its attendant horrors, is another of the
things not permitted by the Constitution,
there would at least be the credit of having
made the attempt. Even if it resulted in
nothing better than the permanent disquali-
fication of obvious Bolsheviks as voters and
law-makers of any and every kind, sorqething
would be gained. There is nothing to pre-
vent the almost imperceptible army being
greatly strengthened against the emergency
which may not be far off, and a lot of
other legal apparatus might be overhauled.
A positive essential is that Bruce should
harden his heart, like a certain Pharaoh of
old, and give his followers a run for their
money, as that monarch did. It has also
been suggested that the Cabinet shoqld get
some lawyers who know the law; but it is
just on the cards that it isn’t the Cabinet s
law that is wrong. The High Court has,
before this, reversed one of its own inter-
pretations of the Constitution, apparently on
the ground that it was a rotten interpreta-
tion.
GHOSTS AND MYTHS OF THE
NORTH.
On a recent day there arrived in Sydney a
young woman of Perth (W.A.), and a girl-
child aged about a dozen years, who had
motored by a northern route from one
capital to the other, thus doing about three-
quarters of the circuit of Australia. They
propose to do the remaining quarter after
brushing some dust off and getting their
hair tidied up. In their progress they
crossed the Northern Territory, touching at
Katherine River, Newcastle Waters, Italy
Waters and other places, and in these pro-
ceedings they met with no opposition, nor
did they report any outstanding hardships.
In fact, a woman and a child made mockery
of the attitude of the seven Federal Minis-
ters who have looked after the Common-
wealth’s big and promising property during
the 15 years of Federal ownership, and
especially turned into jest the great Pearce,
who has had the longest consecutive run in
the Home and Territories, with a time of
complete peace to operate in, and with the
largest number of previous mistakes to guide
him. When these men weren’t simply post-
poning all development work till the war
would be over, their attitude has been that
the Territory is a mystery place, at once
akin to the impenetrable forests of the upper
Amazon and related to the treeless wastes of
Sahara, and that it is a land where ordinary
rules and laws are suspended—including
those of settlement, communication, cohesion,
gravitation, evaporation and water supply.
Some have doubted whether railways are
any good in this bit of Australia, which only
differs from many other bits in its lack
of votes to sell, the idea apparently being
that under the peculiar conditions a line
might fall off. or fall in, or fall up, and so
be lost. Hesitation has even been shown in
the matter of wells and telegraphs, possibly
lest they should go mad in these strange
latitudes and bite, and the unsuitability of
the northern waters for shipping lias been
guarded against by shooing practically all
of it away, bar a hired tub of limited speed
but honorable intentions. The new Parlia-
ment is expected to meet on January 13.
The long, purposeless, obstructive debate on
the Address-in-Reply, which the Prime Minis-
ter isn’t expected to have the courage to sup-
press, and the desert of verbiage over the
Estimates are prognosticated to fill in the
weeks till Easter. And about that time the
Ministry is expected to announce that an-
other determined effort will be made to “solve
the problem” of the Territory, and that a
Polar expedition of three or more highly-paid
explorers, or missionaries, or Commissioners
is to be sent out with a long engagement to
see wliat can be done. If it goes amissing a
relief expedition of more and better-paid
Commissioners will naturally follow.
* * * *
As regards the water-supply difficulties of
the Territory no particular obscurity exists,
and there is no special “problem” to drive a
Minister to floundering antics and whale-like
performances. The latest “Official Year Book”
gives some interesting points about artesian
and sub-artesian bores as follows: —
Tot;il Daily Flow
Bores. Depth in Feet, in Gallons.
Queensland .. 2968 3,676,089 297,903,000
N. S. Wales .. 510 854,282 81,032,000
Westralia .. .. 209 183,051 60,757,000
S. Australia .. 143 112,562 12,972,000
Victoria .. .. 347 93,050 No record
N. Territory . . 167 54,970 6,736,000
The figures really put the Northern Terri-
tory in much too favorable a light. The out-
put of water given in the case of Queensland,
N. S. Wales and South Australia is from
flowing bores only, and it is a misfortune
that a very large number of bores ( in
Queensland the greater number) don’t flow.
The coy fluid rises to within a certain dis-
tance of the surface, and then has to be
pumped, which is a costly process. That
weariful person Minister Pearce recently
made the wildly original discovery (and it
he had discovered the bona fide source of the
Amazon he could have hardly heen more im-
pressive) that the N. Territory wants rail-
ways and available water. The fact that the
third largest province of Australia has the
fewest wells and the least flow of water is
because people like Pearce haven’t sunk
more wells and sunk them deeper. There
is really only one artesian bore in the
entire Territory, if the official authority
is correct, the rest being of the sub-
artesian sort which don’t flow; yet it
is a country where water is reputed to be
obtainable everywhere, if looked for with a
fraction of the assiduity which is devoted to
the search for votes.
The want of better means of communica-
tion, which is always included by Pearces
and other mournful but inquiring folk among
the obscure ailments of the Federal property,
seems to admit of much the same explana-
tion. The responsible people haven’t supplied
better means of communication. Since the-
taking-over of the Territory op fixed condi-
tions, of which the construction of the Soutli-
to-North line was one, this has been the
record: —
New Railways Opened,
Miles.

tion to build about 1087 miles of line, and
thus link together the portions already

the extent of .. - ■ • • • • • • 53
Thus the shortage of railways in the Terri-
tory seems to arise from the same cause as
the lack of water-supply, said cause being
the blank impossibility of getting political
images of the Pearce variety permanently
interested in anything, however important
to Australia’s future, which doesn’t mean
direct political profit, in the immediate
present. As regards the lack of settlement
and trade, the former is at least partly ac-
counted for bv the fact that the Govern-
ment’s best effort has been to reluctantly
sell 2361 acres to settlers between 1911 and
now, and that, save for 14 acres out of each
10 000, it hangs on to its empty vastnesses
like a miser hanging on to his last copper
or a drowning whale clutching at straws. As
for trade, it practically stopped when the
vessels which found it worth while to do
much trade were disqualified under the Navi-
gation Act. and the Government took to
hiring an old ark or two to prevent the sea
looking too absurdly deserted.
* * * *
dry, desolate, despairing howl of the
Government, or that part of it which is
vocal on the subject, is to the effect that
it has exhausted every avenue of investiga-
tion, and the only thing it can think of
in order that the mysterious Territory may
be saved is to provide dignified billets and
good salaries for some friends and well-
wishers there, and then await events. These
appointees will be additional to the officials
already there, and they are reputed to be
numerous enough to fill every available niche
of use and ornament. Already many poli-
ticians and ex-politicians have been suggested
as willing to reluctantly accept the salaries,
or even better ones. The duties of the re-
cipients. so far as can be ascertained, will
be to advise the Minister to use the powers
which he is apparently too tired or
scared to use, and to inform him of things
which he can’t help knowing already. But
the community has lost most of its faith in
the narrow-gauge railway which is creeping
across the continent at an average rate of
31 miles per annum. It isn’t much impressed
by Minister Pearce’s languid proposition,
which shows no sign of bearing fruit, about
selling some small freehold farms, under
elaborate conditions, out of the 334,000,000
acres on which the leasehold fetich sits like
a patient incubus. It is no longer impressed
by Pearce in any shape, form or capacity.
It even doubts whether the present Govern-
ment, no matter what mandate it receives,
will ever have the courage to annoy its Bol-
shevik acquaintances by allowing overseas
vessels to take a free hand in the Territory’s
coastal trade again. And it has reason to
be very tired of the bogus mystery of the
North, and the alleged struggles of chatty
characters to lay or abrogate the ghost.
PLAIN ENGLISH.
The "Big Brniher" Movement.
The Commonwealth Government steamer
Jervis Bay has brought to Australia 155
strapping British lads —mostly “middle-class”
boys fresh from school —for whom some
practical training in agriculture has been
arranged, with a guarantee of 12 months’
work. On arrival at Melbourne 67 members
of the party were met by and entertained in
the homes of 67 kindly citizens who have
individually agreed to take an active interest
in a particular lad while he is learning to
become a Victorian farmer; and 85 young-
sters whose fortunes will lie in N. S. Wales
were similarly welcomed at Sydney. This
is the first instalment .of a scheme which
originated in the mind of Richard Linton,
an Australian. Visiting Britain for the first,
time in 1923. Linton was appalled at the
number of idle youths lie saw wherever he
went. On inquiry he was told that boys were
leaving school at the rate of 1000 per day,
and that in the distressful condition of
the country three-fourths of them had no
present prospect of getting even dead-end
jobs. He determined to do what a good Aus-
tralian could to ameliorate this saddest
feature of the post-war slump in Britain,
and conceived a plan which, having heen un-
folded to sympathetic Britons, enlisted the
support of a sufficient number of like-minded
Australians. The Big Brother movement is
the result. It is a movement with obvious
limits in its present form, but within those
limits it is more likely to succeed than any
gaudy experiment in shoving grown-up new-
chums “on the land” at a cost of £2OOO or
more per newchum —for example, the group-
settlement scheme in Westralia. Those re-
sponsible for it recognise that, if assisted
immigration is to benefit both Britain and
Australia, the immigrants—skilled workers
imported under contract excepted—must be
caught young. Also the Linton plan has
the merit of being independent of politicians;
and the less politicians have to do with the
administrative side of assisted immigration
the better. But the benefits of Big Brother-
hood should not be restricted to British lads.
Australia can do with a Big Brother move-
ment for its own boys. Owing to the craze
for buying foreign goods, and lack of oppor-
tunities for learning trades, and (in some
cases) the ridiculously high wages paid for
boy labor, thousands of young Australians
are in danger of becoming odd-jobbers—
units in the too vast army of unskilled
laborers. These lads should not be forgotten
as the Big Brother spirit grows. Nor should
it be forgotten that there are magnificent
opportunities for adventurous youth of both
nations, adequately trained and equipped, -in
the almost-empty North.
♦
The New Objective.
The first straightforward comment from the
Labor side on the release of Walsh and
Johanson came from Jacob himself, when
he told his own union he was sorry it was
the law and not industrial action that got
him out of custody. Nothing could have
better emphasised the difference between the
old type of Labor leader and the new. The
union official of an earlier generation was,
like Martha, careful and troubled about
many things. It was up to him to see that
the union members got the highest wages,
the shortest hours and the easiest working
conditions that could be wangled either in
conference or from an arbitration court. He
had other duties, too, but these were para-
mount. But to-day, in the case of unions
that have the services of really up-to-date
leaders of the Walsh and Johanson type,
the whole outlook is changed. The object
now is to prevent the members earning any-
thing, and no other consideration is reckoned
of the slightest importance. Mr. Johanson,
just delivered from durance far from vile,
expresses his stern displeasure at the fact
that large numbers of unionists, members of
his own and other industrial organisations,
went on earning wages during his incar-
ceration. Had they not succumbed to this
weakness for work, one gathers, Joiianson s
martyrdom would have been ameliorated
by the happy reflection that his great mis-


sfion was being discharged, even in his ab-
sence. His release as the consequence ot
constitutional processes in which his only
initerest is a bitter antipathy strikes linn
nAore as an impertinence than a boon, and
hie takes no pleasure in it. The recovery ot
a, handsome fortune in damages from the
I J /rime Minister and his colleagues, the people
on Australia and anybody else who might be
served with a writ, is not likely to dispel tins
gloioim These things will come, if come they
doi through tile channel of the law and the
astitution, accursed tilings even When ex-
ency dictates their use. But the mease
frhiVt bondage and the spoiling of the Egyp-
tian's, if arrived at through a prolonged loss
of wages on the part of the people who pay
Johan son to look after their interests, would
have been a glorious indication that at
any moment the Millennium might be seeu
bowling up George-street like a hoop. The
most discouraging feature of the business,
from .Johanson’s standpoint, however, is
the somewhat distrait and preoccupied man-
ner in which his union greeted its master.
It would almost seem that they didn’t want
the cat to come back.

Who Said Cotton?
In spite of pests and pessimists; in face of
abnormally difficult seasons; notwithstand-
ing mistakes inseparable from a new indus-
try, cotton in Australia continues to grow.
The expansion is not magical, but it is con-
sistent

The last three years have been unfavorable.-
The drought of 1922 was followed by a
season of pests. Last season the crop was
severely affected by two reverses —an acute
spell of hot weather in February, which
caused widespread boll shedding, and four
unduly early frosts, which cut the second
and third pickings in some districts very
badly. Cotton is as sensitive to seasonal
vicissitudes as most primary products. The
United States crop fluctuates between a
feast and a famine. That is why cotton
offers one of the biggest gambles in the ex-
changes. The yield for 1921 in U.S.A. was
only 7,953,941 bales. The 1914 crop was
double that. For the three years ending
1923 the average was less than 10,000,000
bales; then, owing to highly favorable
seasons,. the crop expanded to 13,627,936
and 13,588,000 bales during 1924 and 1925
respectively: . With anything like normal
rains during tlife coming summer the Queens-
land crop may easily reach 25,000,0001 b. of
seed cotton, and might total 35,000,0001 b.
Even then the crop would be oiily a drop in
the ocean of the world’s market: 25,009,0001 b.
would mean only 16,000 bales (5001 b. each)
of raw cotton, as compared with 4,000,000
bales by the one American State of Texas
last season. Texas, indeed, offers both an
example and an inspiration to the Australian
grower. The value of the Lone Stax’ State s
yield in each of the past two seasons was
more than three times that of the Australian
wool clip. Texan cotton is grown and picked
mostly by white labor, and under climatic
conditions approximating to those of South-
ern Queensland. Australian cotton closely
resembles Texan in texture and grade. Both
bring a substantial premium in the world s
markets. In our favor is the cheapness and
virginal richness of our lands and the ab-
sence of the dreaded boll-weevil. Against
us is that the Australian has not yet learned
to pick commercially. Our average picking
is not more than 1001 b. of seed-cotton per
eight hours day. The official return of the
Texas picking is 2501 b. per man per 10
hours. The future of the industry rests on
our ability to produce at or below American
costs. It is not colored labor that we need
fear; Europe continues to draw three-fifths
of its needs from U.S.A., the highest-wage
country in the world, all grown in the tem-
perate zone. Nor do Americans fear over-pro-
duction. Last year England took 2,545,123
bales of American lint. Germany, with As
trade revival, took no less than 1,852,720
bales. Japan accounted for 701,575 bales,
worth approximately £35,000,000, from Gulf
of Mexico ports, a total significant to Aus-
tralia, since we are the only people in the
Orient who can supply Japanese mills with
the American type of lint. The passing of
the severe depression in which Europe is at
present immersed must express itself in
firm prices. The normal world-demand
for the raw product is not being met by
present world-production. America, which
has hitherto been the great cotton reservoir
for Europe, lias expanded her spinning in-
dustry to meet the wants of her own ever-
expanding population. The South has be-
come the great textile centre of the country;
cotton is spun within sight of the fields in
which it is grown. Last year U.S.A. mills
absorbed 6,191,349 bales, which was less than
2.000.900 bales short of her total production
of 1921; and, though large importations of
Egyptian were made into the States for the
niaking of motor tyres and mercerised goods,
American reserves are very slender, standing
at 1.610,550 bales in August last as com-
pared with 2,324,999 in 1923 and 6,534,360
in 1920. The big success that will make cot-
ton as significant a factor in the develop-
ment of Australia’s resources as wool has
been should come to us as we follow the
example of our wool-growers from Mac-
akthuk onwards, and make quality the
first principle of production. It costs no
more per pound to grow, pick, gin and trans-
port high-priced lint than it does to produce
low-quality stuff. We have begun well in
this direction. If we continue in it there
seems to be no reason why cotton should not
redeem its early promise.

The Pace that Kills.
Twenty-five casualties, including several
deaths and many very serious injuries,
occurred in Sydney during a recent week-end
as the result of motoring accidents. The
usual week-end crop, of course, but serious
enough to provoke questions, in the N.S.W.
Assembly and a short discussion. The Chief
Secretary was asked if anything was being
done to ensure that motorists did not exceed
a reasonable pace in Sydney, and the reply
was that they were not allowed to “race in-
discriminately at high speeds through the
streets.” The reply was not a fair answer
to the question. The principle underlying
the control of street-traffic in Sydney, as in
some other Australian cities, is the American
one that a relatively smart pace is no more
dangerous than a slower one, and the
advantage of saving everybody’s time. What-
ever may be said of the soundness of the
theory of fast traffic being safer than slow
as applied to the American cities in which it
originated, the practice of it in Sydney has
been followed by some very undesirable con-
sequences, In the first place it has become
practically impossible for the police to dis-
tinguish between a safe and an unsafe traffic
pace. The only practicable test is whether
an accident ensues. A noisy motor-cycle
clattering along at 20 miles an hour looks
faster than a huge limousine gliding past at
twice the pace, just as a launch at 10 knots
gives a greater impression of speed than a
liner doing 20. So the policeman gives up
the job of difficult comparisons, and trusts
to the fact of his presence to keep the traffic
in order. But where there isn’t a policeman,
or isn’t supposed to be a policeman, motorists-
can and do “race indiscriminately at high
speeds through the streets.” The speed-
capacities of modern motor-cars and motor-
cycles, as demonstrated at Maroubra Speedway,
are well in excess of a mile a minute —to p'flt
it very conservatively—and racing on tin?
streets by vehicles capable of such speeds is
criminal. Yet it occurs, and occurs daily,
as any observant citizen could testify. But
apart from racing, the door to which is
bound to be opened by devotion to the “fast-
traffic” fetich, the average pace of motor
Vehicles is too rapid in Sydney, all circum-
stances considered. Among those circum-
stances are the narrowness, and especially
the* varying width, of many of the arteries,
the' hilly character of many of the streets,
the presence on the roads of trams and
horse-drawn traffic, and the absence of any
attempt to regulate the use of the streets by
pedestrians. In Melbourne, and even in
M.L. centres, people afoot are enjoined to
cross the streets only at and
between marked lines. “Jay-walking,” as
the Americans call it, is discouraged. In
Sydney the jest that pedestrians can be
numbered in two classes, the quick and the
dead, is becoming too true to be a jest. On
several occasions lately even the footpaths
have been invaded by motorists travelling at
uncontrollable speeds and children and old
women have been slain. The remedies are
obvious enough—enforcement on all traffic
of a slower pace in the city area, more atten-
tion to the parking problem so that a greater
width of roadway is available for traffic, and
regulations enabling the police to restrain
pedestrians, for their own safety, from run-
ning needlessly into danger.
Culture and the Cinema.
DURING the past year the Sydney University
Extension Board arranged for a total of 118
lectures at which the attendances reached
1.3,225, an average of 112 per lecture. The
lectures were distributed over 25 courses,
nine of which were conducted in Sydney and
its suburbs and the others in 16 country
towns. This is the record of one branch
only of the University’s activities outside
its walls, for it also carries its offering of
knowledge into the ranks of labor through
the Tutorial Classes under the Workers'
Educational Association. It is 76 years since
a Select Committee of the Legislative Coun-
cil of the then colony of N. S. Wales recom-
mended the founding, upon “a liberal and
comprehensive basis,” of “a University winch
shall be accessible to all classes.” That the
University authorities have done their part:
to honor the intention of the founders few
will dispute: to rich and poor, highbrow and
lowbrow, it offers the services of its experts.
Few bovs of to-day but have heard the oft-
expressed regret of their fathers living in
less well-endowed times that they had none
of the educational advantages of to-day. It
is therefore interesting to learn from the
Board what is the attitude of young and
middle-aged men to the surpassingly greater
facilities for study and tutorial assistance
offered them. In estimating the attendances
at the Extension lectures, it must not be
overlooked that they sweep urban and rural,
figures together and presumably include the
large audiences present at Sir Ernest
Butherford’s series of popular lectures in
Sydney. We get a truer criterion, then, of
the appreciation of the benefits offered by the
’Varsity when we go into the country. Dr.
WoolnougH, who carried out the most ex-
tensive tour arranged by _ the Board, makes
some remarks on this point. Speaking in
general,” he says, “the audiences were dis-
appointingly small.” He had visited the
same districts 15 years ago, and then found
“much more enthusiasm for various avenues
of culture than appears to exist at present.
Among the factors contributing to “the un-
doubted falling off in the audiences attending
University Extension lectures during the last
*>o years,” he considers the most important
single cause to be “the unprecedented in-
crease in popularity of the picture show,
and goes on to say: “The craving for melo-
drama fostered by this agency lias largely
destroyed interest in anything that is not
sensational. Reading of anything but the
lightest fiction has been abandoned in favor
of passive absorption of thrills.
quency of these entertainments supplies the
demand for evening recreation, and the tech-
nical excellence in photography combined
with movement in the pictures lias destroyed
nil interest in the comparatively, mediocre
results from the ordinary projection lantern
which illustrates the average lecture. Again,
that other modern invention, the motor-car,
bv linking up once isolated communities,
has enormously facilitated the opportunities
for social intercourse and made people less
dependent on internal sources of interest.
The report does not touch the Workers
Tutorial Classes, but those who are m a posi-
tion to fudge doubt whether they are as
fully appreciated by the section for which
thev cater as might reasonably be expected.
A stranger dropping in at a Tutorial lecture
would probably find more members drawn
from outside the industrial ranks than he
would from within them. Another signifi-
cant factor is pointed out by the same com-
mentator. The teacher interested in his
work estimates the lecture, if passively re-
ceived, as failing in its effect. Its true ob-
ject is to arouse intellectual activity, and
here again the modern youug man and maid,
even where they resist the lure of the movie,
seem to be on the way to decadence. "I was
somewhat disappointed,” says the Doctor,
‘‘at the lack of response to the request for
discussion of the subjects at the close of
each lecture. I have found this tendency to
be universal and growing.” The question is
a serious one. The movie can, doubtless, be
used as an instrument of education, but it
is comparatively rarely put to that purpose;
and of itself it is at best a poor substitute
for the lecture, the discussion and the text-
book. At any rate, the experience of the
Board seems to indicate a general weakening
of intellectual fibre in modern life, a waning
appetite for knowledge and a slackening in
the love of study, all suggesting a definite
downward trend in our civilisation.

The Commissioner-Appointing Disease.
It is announced by Peakce, of the Home
and Termites Department, that the inter-
rupted work of appointing three or more
Commissioners to brood and cogitate, if pos-
sible in conjunction with State cogitators
from Westralia and Queensland, and incu-
bate a policy for the Northern Territory, will
be resumed. Said Pearce in his best official
voice:—■
I am confident that this is the only way that
anything effective can be done to develop the North.
... .We want someone clothed with power to do
things and supplied with the necessary money to
carry them out. I have recently had an opportunity
of meeting two members of our Land Board, Messrs
Easton and Williams, who have spent some months
inspecting the pastoial lands in the northern portion
of,the Commonwealth. ... Both assured me that there
are*vast areas which, if given railway communication
and water supply, will carry millions of sheep.
They said, further, that there is no doubt about
water being there- if bored for.
Probatily they also informed Pearce that
Queen Anne is dead and that the Dutch
seem to bic in permanent possession of Hol-
land. The existence of vast pastoral areas
and of subterranean water was known be-
fore Pe&rce was born, and it is one of the
disgraces of Pearce’s department that with
so much known water available far less
boring has been done in the N. Territory
than in any of the mainland States. It
represents 17i per cent, of Australia in area,
and has a little over 1 per cent, of the wells
if measuiled by depth, or 32 per cent, it
measured by number. Kven on the great
stock route, from north to south, where no
deep sinking is required, wells are ridicu-
lously far apart. At one of them the pump-
ing apparatus is said to have recently col-
lapsed, two' years of hard reporting upon its
worn-out condition having failed to catch
the eye of the Home and Termites Depart-
ment. The consequent perish of travelling
cattle by thirst was not an edifying spectacle.
Various questions arise out of Senator
Pearcle’s pronouncement, and have been ris-
ing continuously ever since the N. Territory
passed into Federal keeping, or, in other
ivords, since it passed out of hands which
were partly paralysed by the lack of money,
and pfissed into a control which had nothing
wrong with it except lack of patriotism,
absence of the pioneering spirit, indifference
to evertything wdiich didn’t promise immedi-
ate votes, and too much laziness, ignorance,
stupiditty and subservience to State preju-
dices. Two of those questions are :
Seeing (that all that is required to open “vast
areas” and, raise “millions of sheep” is railway com -
munication . and more -wells, why doesn’t Pearce
propose to give the N. Territory more wells right
off, and, as* soon as possible, at least the preliminary
railway to.-which the Government is pledged, instead
of giving it expensive and, it may be, dawdling
Oommiasidners who may develop an idiotic frame of
mind, asnd not supply either railway communication
or wells?
What is the good of all the bunkum about the
Commissioners being valuable because they will have
“power to do things,” when they won’t and can t
have any more power than the underlings who are
said to Have cried to the Department for two years
about a worn-out pump? The Commissioners will
have no power to levy taxes, to float loans locally
or abroad, or to raise money by the sale of Govern-
ment land. So they will spend their lives in
planning works and improvements, and trying to
persuade some Pearce or other to beguile some
Bruce or other to interest some Government party
or another, so that it will provide enough money,
or vote a trifle on account.
Things that would help the Northern Terri-
tory are a standard-gauge railway crossing
the continent from south to north, a free-
hold policy to encourage laftd settlement so
that there would presently be enough people
to run the place on self-governing lines with-
out any pompous frill of Commissioners, and
a lot more wells. Water-finding is so easy
in the Territory that the greatest depth sunk
before water was struck was 1760 ft. And it
would be a material help to get rid of
Pearce, and replace him by somebody who
would do his own work, and not wander
about appointing deputies, middlemen and
go-betweens.

The News.
Arthur Cocks, ex-Agent General for N. S.
Wales, no sooner hit these shores than he
unburdened himself of a plaint about the
way this country is misrepresented in the
English press. The only news it furnished
about us is of our crimes and our catastro-
phes. It is an ancient grievance. In
the issue of the Australian paper that
reported and solemnly endorsed the returning
pilgrim’s grievance, the following items ot
foreign news were presented to its readers:
Political crisis in France.
Republican threats of violence in Ireland.
Civil war in China.
Graeco-Bulgarian argument with fists.
A squabble in Mosul between John Bull and
Abdul.
Fighting in Morocco.
A brutal murder in Britain.
Consulting its library, The Bulletin finds
that readers of the latest issue to hand of
the leading newspaper in China are inter-
ested in
Rum-running outrages in U.S.A.
Murder of an Australian woman in Java.
Suspicious death of a millionaire’s wife at Los
Angeles.
Arrests of communists in Poland.
The chief organ of public enlightenment in
Singapore thinks its subscribers want to
hear about
Indian bomb outrage.
Revolution in Bolivia.
Threats of revolution in Sydney.
Murder of an Australian woman in Java.
The Sinar Sumatra, a vernacular journal
circulating amongst the cultivated Malays ot
Padang, Dutch East Indies, gratifies the
taste of its clients with
British tyranny in Iraq.
French atrocities in Morocco.
Ex-Sultan Hamid's harem.
Murder of an Australian woman in Java.
Coming nearer home, the Melbourne news-
paper that began the argument thinks its
purchasers will be interested in the statement
that a plot to bribe N. S. Wales Labor mem-
bers has been frustrated by a Labor paper, that
a verandah collapsed in Adelaide, that the
unemployed threaten to loot Hobart, and that
an unmarried couple left a baby on a Perth
verandah. Of course, Australia, is misrepre-
sented. In fact, until the average citizen
of the earth develops a taste for abstract
science, art for art’s sake and love of his
neighbor instead of secret envy, curiosity
and dislike, this paper is willing to wager
a sheep-station against a couple of man
dated colonies that the next time the journal
which agrees with Arthur Cocks prints
news from Patagonia, it will concern the
assassination of a president or the amours
of a movie star.

Mother’s Unwanted Million.
The suggestion of Ramsay MacDonald
that Britain might spend some of the money
she has to spare for emigration subsidies on
settling her own people on her own land is
not the silliest thing that has been said on
the subject. Admitted that the primary
cause of the Cold Country's present distress
is over-population, which seems to be the
most generally-accepted diagnosis, it is still
a fact that attempts to alleviate the pressure
by stimulating migration have been signally
unsuccessful. Canada, South Africa and
Australia are taking fewer British immi-
grants per annum than they did before the
war, while the U.S.A. has placed positive
barriers in the way of an increased How
into that territory. Underlying all the
flowery language that is used between the
London and overseas Governments when dis-
cussing these family matters is the fact
that Mother and daughters are at cross-
purposes. The neo-Conservative notion of
Imperial development, as expressed by such
men as Amery, is the maintenance of the
Dominions’ status as primary producers.
They are to be the hewers of wood and
drawers of water, so to speak, feeding the
manufacturers of the Overcrowded Kingdom
with raw materials and orders for finished
products. Hence the insistence upon con-
verting skilled artisans and unskilled laborers
from the cities into farmers and farm-
laborers in the Dominions. The more direct
means of reducing Mother’s population-
pressure—a transferral of industrial workers
in Britain to similar work in the.colonies —
never seems to enter into Imperial calcula-
tions. The result of this game of cross-
purposes has been rather peculiar. As Lord
Inchcape bluntly remarked recently, the
aim of the Dominions and India seems to be
to manufacture all their requirements and
import nothing, but it is an aim that
is never admitted at the Imperial coun-
cil table. Hence it comes about that
while the Continental units of Empire—
Australia, Canada and South Africa —are
taking fewer immigrants, Maoriland, with
practically no new land available for settle-
ment, is" breaking all previous records.
The explanation is simple. The M.L. Gov-
ernment is in the hands of an agrarian
party to which the idea of cheap and plenti-
ful farm labor is attractive. The elusive-
ness of the goal so far has not discouraged
attempts to attain it. The position that
has arisen is not satisfactory, from the
standpoint of the small Dominion or the
other portions of the Empire, Mother in-
cluded. It is not likely to be altered for
the better until there is a frank recognition
on the part of the men who govern Britain
that the outlook of “the colonies” has changed
in the last hundred years. It may be, as
the London Daily Mail has unpleasantly
mentioned, that Australia cannot afford to
hand-pick her immigrants with so much of
her territory unoccupied ; but Australia does
many things she cannot afford to do, and
to point out that she cannot afford them is
no deterrent. Mother’s most urgent political
task is to shake a million and a quarter
of workless dole-takers off her apron-strings,
thus relieving her industries of a choking
burden of taxation, and if she cannot get
rid of them her way she will have to get
rid of them the Dominions’ way. And that
will probably mean putting a good many
British millions into the development of
“colonial” manufacturing industry.

Education and Exams.
“Country Fed” : While supervising in a
centre for the annual examinations for the
Vic. Qualifying and Merit Certificates held
on November 20, I could not help noticing
one youngster as, with brow deeply fur-
rowed, he wrestled physically and mentally
with the various sheets of questions. The
pained and wearied look in his eyes told
all too plainly that lie was attempting a task
far beyond his mental capacity, though
he was 13 years of age, one year above
the standard for Q.C. In the seat before
him sat a girl, not yet 10, revelling in the
same exam., her pen and pencil racing to
give expression to the knowledge that pos-
sessed her. Poor lad ! I pitied him; more
so when I corrected his papers and found
that his desperate efforts were in vain, for
he failed badly in five subjects out of six,
and 0 decorated more than one of his answer
papers. This is supposed to be a humani-
tarian age led by enlightened educationists;
yet we still persist in tormenting youngsters
in this cruel fashion. If the trouble only
lasted for one day it would not be so bad,
but the tribulation extends for nine months,
while worried teachers attempt to cram
figures and facts into the aching heads of
children who can never possibly assimilate
them. No wonder this boy, according to
the testimony of his teacher, cried over his
lessons every day. It is time this cruel
farce of forcing all children to attend certain
set annual State-wide examinations was
abolished. Though this reason is never ad-

vanced by their advocates, they are only
held because they form a rough—very rough,
indeed —estimate of a school’s progress and
a teacher’s teaching ability (actually his
methods of cramming), and thus save the
extremely busy district inspector a certain,
amount of work and enable him to super-
vise a larger number of schools. Really,
when one looks deeper into the matter, one
senses that the old parsimonious treatment
of State education, the heritage of last cen-
tury, is at the root of the evil. To double
the number of inspectors, and so halve the
inspectorates, would sound the death-knell
of this unenlightened examination system..
For then, instead of hurriedly visiting a
school once or twice a year, the D.I. would
be perfectly free to visit a school as often,
as he wished, not merely for inspection,
but for the purposes of genuine supervision
and helpfulness. If the public still demanded
certificates of school progress—and they cer-
tainly have a value outside the school —in
conjunction with the teacher the D.I. could
issue them.

The N.S.W. Council and the Axe.
The political situation in N. S. Wales,
according to the sudden and astonishing
forecast of the Monday morning papers, was
somewhat as follows, and it was a good deal
of forecast to assimilate all at once:—
His Excellency He Chair was to assent to the
appointment of a vast batch of new Leg. Councillors
—sufficient to carry all the Communist-Labor Gov-
ernment’s measures without amendment and without,
debate, and even without civiljty. This would not
have been so easy if ex-Premier Fuller had filled
up existing vacancies instead of leaving the oppor
tunity to his successor; but Fuller seldom or never
missed a chance to do the weak and procrastinating;
thing.
The swamping of the Upper House was to be a
prelude to the abolition of said House without popu-
lar sanction. If any Nationalist Government had
had the prevision to establish the referendum,
that a popular vote could be held on questions like
this, or to put the Upper House on a wide elective
basis similar to that of the Senate and make it at
least as reliable a Voice of the People as the Assem-
bly, this move would have been impossible; but
Nationalist Governments of the Fuller type have no
prevision worth mentioning.
The swamping of the Leg. Council with the aid
of Excellency De Chair, and the subsequent abolition
of that body, were to be followed by the abolition
of De Chair and imported Governors in general. If
this should mean that the State Governor would be
appointed by the Governor-General, as in Canada,
the change would be an improvement. If it meant
election by the whole body of the people as in the
United States, it would be a still greater improve-
ment. The system which supplies an orthodox and
starchy Governor for perhaps four years, and then a
violent political partisan and local makeshift for
perhaps 18 months, is too spasmodic. But it is
generally assumed that the idea is to choose the
Governor by caucus or by Labor Conference, so that
the job will be a perquisite of the violent and a
profit for the crooked and the uncouth.
The basis of it all was, to a great extent,
the rotten and undemocratic idea, which the
Storey-Dooley Cabinet introduced and
which Fuller and uearne were too slow
and fatigued to remove, of filling casual
Assembly vacancies by nomination instead
of by election. A return to the electoral
system might have destroyed the Lang
majority in the first days of the Lang
Ministry. Ex-Speaker Dan Levy made the
discovery (or thought he did, and it really
seemed a genuine find) that the Casual
Vacancies Act was a temporary device which
has expired, and a party which was willing
to take sporting legal chances, as Walsh
and Johanson did with striking results,
and which had the stomach for a fight, might
have tried its luck on the matter. But the
Nationalists didn’t. One hardly expected
that they would.
The bitter feud between Albert \\ illis,
the union boss of the N.S.W. coal-miners,
and Jack Bailey, State president of the
A.W.U., has reached a stage where disaster
threatens Willis. For two years that bulky
gentleman had things all his own way. Be-
coming president of the A.L.P., a body which
Bailey had dominated for years, he routed
the Bailey faction at the 1923 Labor Con-
ference, caused Bailey to be expelled from
the party on charges of selection-ballot
swindling, and had the satisfaction. of seeing
the sentence confirmed by ex-Premier Theo-
dore (also of the A.W.U.), who was called
in as arbitrator. And at tbe State election,
while Bailey had to surrender his safe
Assembly seat, the Labor party, under
Willis’s presidency, fluked a majority which
resulted in that “stalwart” being named
Vice-President of the Executive Council. The
Welshman’s stocks began to slump when the
annual Labor conference was abandoned, at
his instance, lest the Bailey faction regain
control. His unbrilliant leadership of the
Leg. Council and the growing hostility to
the imported element since Nov. 14 have
also injured his standing in the party; and
in an infatuated moment he fathered the
Labor Daily yarn that four Labor members
were to be offered £20,000 of Nationalist
money for their votes. Now Bailey and the
Worker, with the whole A.W.U. behind
them, and with the goodwill of some of
Willis’s loving comrades in the Parliamen-
tary caucus, are demanding liis Ministerial
head, and it looks as if they will have to be
obliged.

“Temsee” : I am sorry to have missed see-
ing on its publication “R.H.’s” courteous
challenge (B. 29/10/’25) concerning my
condemnation (B. 8/10/’25) of conditions in
some Melbourne charitable institutions,
otherwise I would have hastened earlier to
satisfy his justifiable request for the name
of the institution or institutions I had par-
ticularly in view. As it is in every way
desirable that as much public attention as
possible should be given to the whole ques-
tion of how a community views its obligations
to its stricken and helpless members, I re-
joice that “R.H.,” in the interests of the
well-conducted Home of the Little Sisters of
the Poor in the Northcote suburb of Mel-
bourne, has raised this question of identity,
and I welcome the opportunity for answering
it. First, I would point out that the North-
cote home, which “R. 11.” champions with
knightly courtesy, is differentiated in an
important particular from the establishments
I condemn by the fact, stated by “R. 11.,”
that “it receives not a penny of Government
money,” whereas the institutions I was firing
at receive, as I stated, “substantial annual
grants from the State.” These latter insti-
tutions —the so-called benevolent asylums—
SANTA KLAUS ARRIVES.
are the places I referred to generally in my
article of 8/10/‘25 ; and the one concerning
which I gave particulars is the chief and
largest of them all, the Melbourne Benevolent
Asylum at Cheltenham, 13 miles from the
city, which houses 300 to 700 unfortunates
of both sexes. Should any reader of the
article think my account of the place is an
exaggeration based on hearsay information, I
may state that I had myself been unfortu-
nately an inmate of that institution for some
four years. So I wrote whereof I knew —
knew only too well. None of those officially
concerned with the professed philanthropic
establishments of Melbourne was in doubt as
to the identity of the institution specially
pilloried. For some time past the best-
informed on these matters among the leading
people of Victoria have recognised that the
term “benevolent” as part of the titles of
such institutions (of which there are several
scattered about the State) is a misdescrip-
tion calculated to mislead the charitably
inclined; and the necessity for these dump-
ing-places for broken humanity to be im-
proved is now beginning to impress itself
upon the slowly-responsive public. It remains
for the Government, in the interests of com-
mon humanity, to assume entire control and
direction of these institutions and thereafter
administer them with efficient, trained offi-
cials. Management by private amateur
committees should be abolished forthwith
and a system of enlightened, scientifically
humane treatment of inmates, both indi-
vidually and collectively, installed under
direct and vigilant Government control. At
present the so-called “benevolent” institutions
of the Victorian pattern are a cross between
a badly-managed prison and an ill-conducted
imbecile asylum.

“ J.G.”: Although the N. S. Wales law
respecting the cleanliness of dairies is strict
and inspections are regular and rigid, the
Act seems to have overlooked an inspection
of the dairy-attendants. In my district I
know of three men who have had parts of
their faces and scalps removed for cancer,
and are still having operations performed
periodically, and a woman whose nose has
completely gone in the same way; and all of
them still milk cows, turn the sepnmtor and
scour out the cream-cans.

A few days after a woman was found dead
in a Melbourne street in circumstances that
pointed to a night encounter with a passing
petrol-waggon, another pirate ran a
woman and child in broad daylight. The
child was picked up seriously injured and
its mother dying. The car proceeded on its
way until an infuriated crowd surrounded it;
it would have gone hard with the owner (a
Greek) if the police had not intervened.
Unless the law deals more seriously with this
class of offender Australia will stage a lynch-
ing one of these days.

Almost any intelligent official is adequate
to discharge the routine jobs that fall to
the average consuls lot. L IOKUGAWA,
Japan s new Consul-General to this country,
is a dignitary of a different sort. In order
to realise lus tonnage it is necessary to go
back into Japanese history a matter of eight
centuries. About that time tlie famous
Shogunate system was instituted. lhe
Mikado became a mere puppet, with a good
deal of religious prestige but no political
power at all. The heads of various great
clans struggled for the job of Shogun until
the seventeenth century, when the Tokuga-
was seized the prize. From then until 1867
they were so much the actual rulers of the
country that when Perry presented his
celebrated letter from the President of the
United States to the Emperor of Japan, he
delivered it to the Shogun at Yedo. The
new Consul-General is the direct descendant
of these all-powerful Tokuga was : if it had
not been for the Restoration in 1867 he might
be sitting on the throne to-day. His fore-
bears’ fall from power was largely unde-
served. The first Tokugawas initiated the
Policy of isolating their country from the
outside world in order to prevent the white- j
anting of their institutions by the hairy bar-
barian from overseas. In its time it was a
policy of wisdom, but when later on the
same rulers who had introduced it saw that
Japan must either better the foreigner’s in-
struction or become his slave, and deliberately I
reversed their policy, they were made
the scapegoats of the disappointed mob '
Nevertheless the astute policy of the Toku-J
GAWAS remained the policy of their succesf
sors, with the result that the country oh
artist-workmen and armored bowmen of m
years ago is the country that in 1!)25 owils
the third largest navy in the world. The
appointment of Iyemasa Tokugawa to th/is
country is an incident of some political iil-
portance. It serves to emphasise the fact
that the Elder Statesmen of the island kiij"-
dom regard diplomatic relations with Aus-
tralia as more than a matter of attendjfa"
to stranded matlows, endorsing passp/orts
and registering trade statistics. (

“S.G-.”: A report from London suggests
that a lot more Bolshies will have fo be
gaoled presently, the campaign for the Bol-
shevisation of the British bluejacket \iavirw
been resumed. The frowsy conspirators who
got what was coming to them last month
were prosecuted under laws passed by the
second Pitt after the mutinies at Spithead
and the Nore. Inspired by curiosity, I
up a contemporary’s account of those dis-
turbances, which contains some curiousiy
modern touches :
What would have been a strike in a .factory was
a mutiny in a fleet. In the 16 men-of/tvar lying a t
Spithead a new power had suddenly arisen— the
authority of 32 delegates. Three admirals Went on
board the Queen Charlotte and had a conference
with the delegates. One gave way to passion, seized
a delegate by the collar, swore he would hang them
all, and narrowly escaped with his own life. Then
was hoisted the terrible signal of the red flag—the
pirates’ signal, which implied that no quarter would
be given A bill was rapidly carried through
both Houses for an increase of pay and allow-
ance to the seamen and marines. The bloody flag was
struck and the fleet put to sea. But the danger
was not overpast. The redress of grievances alleged
by the fleet at Spithead applied to the whole navy.
The mutineers at the Nore repeated these complaints
as if they had not been redressed, and assumed an
attitude which made conciliation impossible- At the
Nore the acts of the fleet were those of a foreign
enemy. The delegates had chosen a daring man as
their president— Richard Parker, who signed the
demands of his associates as if he were invested
with supreme power. The red flag was hoisted. The
mutineers moored their ships in a. line across the
river, and intercepted every merchant-vessel. Pitt
brought in bills to provide for the more effectual
punishment of those who should excite mutiny and
sedition in the navy. The mutineers quickly dis-
covered that the Government was too strong for them.
All the ships at anchor struck the red flag.
Obedience was soon completely restored, and Parker,
who had been a small shopkeeper in Scotland, was
hanged.
Apropos, the “advanced” Australian Laborite
is fond of claiming a noble origin for the red
flag whose praises he sings in the dismal
dirge of that name—“the funeral march of
a fried eel,” as somebody calls it..
♦
“Bex” : The House of Lords decided in the
notorious Russell v. Russell divorce case
that evidence of non-access by a husband or
wife cannot be admitted where the result may
be to bastardise a child. Any doubts that
may have existed as to whether this ruling
applies in Victoria have been dissolved by a
decision of the State's Full Court. A husband
petitioned for a divorce from bis wife on the
ground of adultery: it was shown in evidence
that he had been living apart from her for
three years, and that she had obtained a
maintenance order against him. Then she was
delivered of, a child at the Women’s Hospital
of which he denied the paternity. His law-
yer put the wife in the witness-box, but she
refused to say why she entered the hospital
or whether she had or had not committed
adultery with anybody. The child died
before the hearing. The Court held that,
despite differences in the divorce legis-
lation of England and Vic., the rule applied
in Victoria; and the fact that there was no
living child to bastardise and that the parties
were living apart under a maintenance order
does not alter the position. The upshot is
that in cases such as these the husband s
mouth is shut, and unless he can prove by
third persons that he did not have access
the child must be his, and it follows that
there can have been no adultery. Neverthe-
less, English Judges have already started
whittling down the House of Lords decision;
it lias been held, for instance, that it does
not apply in the case of a still-born child,
and in an even more recent case it was
decided that a wife’s confession that a child
was conceived in adultery is evidence against
her so long as she does not assert that her
husband could not have had access at the
time. The Russell case (a majority de-
cision of three against two) was not binding
on our courts, and it is open to grave ques-
tion whether the Vic. Full Court has acted
wisely in adopting a rule which is supposed
to protect the secrets of married life when
the Divorce Courts exist for the ventilation
of them.

POLITICAL
POINTS
From the army of applicants for unpaid
positions in the N.S.W. Leg. Council, the
State Labor caucus picked J 5 by ballot be-
fore the Randwick races on Saturday.. The
successful candidates (all victims of the
nefarious capitalist) comprise business mana-
gers, manufacturers, lawyers, storekeepers,
union secretaries and organisers and defeated
Labor candidates; also “Larry Cotter, Syd-
ney financier, and Jack O’Dea, Randwick
bookmaker.” Presumably Jack O’Dea will
be asked to suggest a plan for “securing the
workers the full results of their industry.’
After casting a number of insults at the
High Court in the form of compliments upon
its decision in the Deportation case, Senator
Gardiner proceeded to define the attitude ot
the Labor party, of which he is deputy-
leader, towards lawnorder: —
Our method has teen to submit to laws even when
we disagreed with them, but by constitutional means
to repeal bad laws to make room for better and
more equitable laws. Hut we never denied the right
of any union or organisation to decide the matter
entirely for themselves.
In other words, Labor was prepared to run
with the constitutional hare and hunt with
the unconstitutional hounds. And its deputy-
leader regards himself as quite a pillar of the
Constitution because he Belongs to a party
that isn’t an unconstitutional hound all the
time.
John Greig Latham became Federal
Attorney-General last week in place of L. E-
Groom, who is to li<rve the bpeakership it
he will take it. Latliam succeeded Best as
M.H.R. for Kooyong (Vic.), being elected
three years ago as an anti-Hughes Liberal,
and was regarded by the Cockies as one ot
themselves until the association was severed a
few months back without ill-feeling on either
side. A barrister oi some tonnage with a bent
for constitutional law, Latham served in
the Intelligence Branch of the R.A.N. during
the war and was assistant-secretary to the
British Empire Delegation at the Pans
Peace Conference. He is 10 years younger
than Groom, who is rising 59, and 20 years
less tired. Groom, though amiable always,
has given unmistakable signs lately of being
weary.
In 1922 the S.A. Labor party captured the
three Senate seats, although the Nat.-Cocky
groups polled 4022 more first preferences.
Had proportional voting obtained last month
and six seats been available, the party would
have secured two —and two it still has. lu
1906, when S.A. Labor sent Russell to 30m
McGregor, Guthrie and Story, who had been
elected in 1903 for six years, it disputed the
election of Vardon, a Liberal, and, on the
High Court unseating him, nominated J. V.
O’Loghlin instead, being in temporary con-
trol of the State Parliament. These cir-
cumstances were recalled when ex-l remier
Harwell was appointed to succeed O Loghlin,
and they didn’t help the luckless Joel Moses
Gabb. Nevertheless, in entering federal
polities by the nomination route Harwell
challenges invidious comparisons with Ley,
sometime N.S.W. Minister of Justice, who
abandoned an Assembly seat worth ±B<s a
year and a fair prospect of becoming Oppo-
sition-leader (and thence Premier) to tackle
a Labor M.11.R. whose 1922 majority was
3500, and beat him by over a thousand.
The breach between Labor moderates and
extremists is widening in Queensland. The
A.W.IJ. and all the prominent politicians are
on one side; on the other are the Railway
Union,, the seamen, the wliarfies and many
of the craft unions affiliated with the. Trades
and Labor Council. Queensland will have
two Labor conferences within the next couple
of months—the special trades-union con-
gress, controlled by the Reds, and the trien-
nial Labor conference, controlled by the
moderates. And the State election will be
upon them while they are fighting out their
quarrels.
JUICE.
“There is great joy in some circles over the High Court’s decision in the Deportation Case.*
MISS AUSTRALIA : “Those men say the cars broken down hopelessly."
CHAUFFEUR BRUCE: “Bless you, no! Merely wants some more petrol."
The N.S.W. Labor party has had no luck
with its plans for consolidating the Tam-
rnanv regime in municipal Sydney by the
addition of suburban areas with Labor
majorities, regardless of the ratepayers
views. In the Dooley Government’s time
Paddington was to be tacked on, but some
of the Paddington Labor aldermen revolted
and the plot failed. The Lang Government s
scheme provided for the amalgamation of
Sydney and Waterloo, which suburb was to
receive a present of £50,000 per annum for
four years and double its fair share of re-
presentation. In other words, the Sydnev
ratepayers were to pay Waterloo £200,000
for the privilege of getting four more Labor
aldermen, and that without being consulted in
the matter. This nefarious piece of legis-
lation was defeated on the second reading
in the Leg. Council. It didn’t deserve to get
even that far.
Adelaide City Council has decided that
it won’t be a consenting party to the preach-
ing of revolution: it has passed a by-law to
require Botanic Park orators to get a permit
before they mount the soap-box. There is
an outcry about “sitting on the safety-valve.
But the time has come to reconsider a lot of
the ancient guff about “free speech.” It won’t
do much harm to allow Smithski to advocate
cannibalism so long as there is no danger ot
the thing being adopted; but if some great
European nation openly embraced canni-
balism and practised it as a regular thing,
and spent large sums in advocating its prac-
tice elsewhere, there iVoiild be a good deal ol
sense in putting the lid on soap-box oratory
in praise of cannibalism.
While Victoria's Dreary House was wait-
ing for the Income-tax Bill it had an aca-
demic debate on the Street-trading Bill, the
main purpose of which was to regulate the
employment of infant newsvendors. Every-
body knew the badly-drafted thing was
doomed from the beginning; it had to be
tinkered in the Assembly, and when Cohen
and a few others kicked it in the Council
it collapsed. It will be reconstructed next
session, and may then have a chance—there
is room for it.
A passionately patriotic article in the S.
M. Herald argued, quite correctly, that it
Sydney took in everything within a 1 0-mile
radius, as Melbourne does, it would include
ten more towns, and be larger and more
bloated with population than it is, and the
Best of the State would be more of an empty
failure than ever. The view was apparently
held that an injury had been done, and that
an action should lie for Wrongful Depriva-
tion of Dropsy.
It is announced, in a superfluous.way, that
Bill Lambert, ex-Lord Mayor of Sydney, will
not resign his safe seat at West Sidney to
make room for Theodore, who gave up the
Queensland State Premiership to enter
Federal politics, and didn’t enter because t.be
door blew shut. Con Wallace had n est
Sydney, and was persuaded to surrender it
and the salary in favor of Ryan, an ex-
Queensland Premier, who also couldn t find a
Federal seat in his own State. It was under-
stood that the retiring man would be
provided for, but all he got was a Brisbane
waterside job at starvation wages. When
Ryan died, Cou Wallace, back in search of
a better crust, tried for the West Sydney
nomination again, but Bill Lambert wanted
it, and he had much the louder roar. Where-
fore Wallace did the only logical thing, and
died in the odor of ingratitude. In the cir-
cumstances Bill Lambert isn't likely to sacri-
fice himself for another politically homeless
Queensland Premier.
Never has a Vic. Government heard more
candid criticism from its friends than the
present Coalition has had to listen to. When
the third Peacock Government was totter-
ing on the brink last year the Premier
strained a point to have H. I. Cohen, K.C.,
Minister for Public Works, made Attorney-
General. The new job lasted only a week,
but Cohen was able to gratify what was pro-
bably a life-long ambition. Now, by way of
recompense, Cohen, in his capacity as unoffi-
cial leader of the Uppah Chambah, says
acidly that Peacock has neither the inclina-
tion nor the ability to fill the office of Treas-
urer.
“0.H.”: In other days the Vic. Labor
party would have been in the van in standing
up for the rights of the Assembly against
the Council, but last week it refused to fight
the Uppah Chambali when that body rejected
the Government’s financial proposals, de-
manding a 3d. in the £ income-tax rate in-
stead of the 4d. the Ministry proposed. In
the same way the six Labontes in the
Dreary House ranged themselves alongside
the squires, cockies and commercial mag-
nates. Class consciousness isn t halt as real
a thing as party consciousness.
It is reported all of a sudden that another
section (158$ miles) of the South-to-North
railway may be put in hand by the Common-
wealth Government. The new start is to
be made on the northern end, where labor
is scarce and dear, and where materials
will have to be humped round a vast distance
by sea, instead of from the southern or I ort
Augusta end, where people are white and
fairly sane, and materials are handy. Also,
the 3ft. Gin. measurement is to be persisted
in, by way of a joke on the Government s
uniform gauge policy. Still even a rumor
of movement is better than no bread.
Exercising a right he possesses under the
Closer Settlement Act, Downward, Vic.
Lands Minister, has decided not to go on
with the resumption of the Banemore (fwo-
mey) Estate, near Hamilton. Advised by
arbitrators, Justice Macfarlan fixed £lO an
acre as the value, and at that figure the
transaction would have meant an outlay o~
£115,000. The Settlement Board ottered £B,
and might have gone to £O, but thought £lO
out of the question, especially after the
report of the Soldier-Settlement Commission
on the results of placing Diggers on dear
land. So it was considered better to pay the
arbitrators’ fees and let the trustees con-
tinue to hold the property.
A while ago an application was made to
the Tariff Board on behalf of a Kalgoorlie
eo. to have the duty taken off inside plates of
ball mills on the ground that they could not
be satisfactorily made in Australia. Ihese
plates suffer severe wear, and for years the
only sort that had stood up to the work had
been made by Hadfields, of Sheffield. How-
ever, when some plates were wanted in a
hurry an order was given to Hadfields ( Aus-
tralia), Ltd., whose works are at Sydney.
The next that was heard about it was a re-
peat order, then another, then still another.
And then it came out that the plates which
“couldn’t be made in Australia had beaten
those from Sheffield by 10 per cent, on a
wearing test.
For the first time in dreary years an opti-
mistic note is sounded in Britain, and there
is talk of more work and better pay. It is
set down on all sides to the fact that Prime
Minister Baldwin has been “sneaking in -Pro-
tection.” as Jennings and Dibbs once did in
N S Wales, and the silk industry is said to
be specially cheerful. In a country where
living is cheaper and wages are lower than
in Australia, where workers, barring the coal-
miners. do 48 hours per iveek and com
munists get 15 months, a little Protection
goes a good way.
“Old Parliamentary Hand” : In the last 42
years no Vic. Ministry, has been treated with
less respect by both Houses of Parliament
than the Allan-Peacock Cabinet. True, no
countenance was given to the Elmslie Labor
Government (1913), which lasted lo days,
but Elmslie and co. were only filling a gap
while the wayward Libs, were being brought
into line. Very little generosity was shown
to the Bowser Administration (191 <-!»),
but it maintained a good Parliamentary
status. Nobody dared to throw empty tins
or bottles at it. Any old missile is con-
sidered good enough to hurl at Allans Gov-
ernment. The easy-going Premier and tne
too amiable Treasurer haven't managed to
maintain discipline on their own side or to
stand up firmly enough to the Labor Oppo-
sition. Few Ministerial supporters are really
loyal, and every Laborite is a captain,' m nis
own opinion. Bent was fortunate in having
J. M. Davies as leader of the Council, and
deferred much to him. Allan is handicapped
in not having a colleague of the same calibre
instead of Richardson.
Among the odd jobs which may be
attended to soon, if the Bruce Government
will cut out useless debate on addresses m
reply where no reply is required, and on cen-
sure" motions which lead nowhere, is one con-
cerning the High Court. That body, or part
of it, is past its first youth. No retiring age
has ever been fixed for its Judges, and as no
pensions are provided no one likes to
contemplate giving the oldest of them the
shoot.” It is suggested that both retiring
age and pensions may be attended to shortly.
If they are not, then should the Communist
party win the election of 1928_ it will be able
to fix a retiring age which will sweep away
the whole collection at once, and make room
for a judicial generation such as Queensland
has lately put on the Bench.

[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
“It used to be his [Willis’s] pleasant habit to
blame everything that went wrong on Jack Bailey
and his gang. Well, Jack Bailey and bis gang have
been pushed aside, and yet, instead of a sweetened
atmosphere, the Labor movement absolutely hums,
and people are holding their noses and staring at
one another in dismay.”—Australasian Worker.
Comrades, firmly grasp your noses! No boronia
here, or roses —
(Oh the sliding-panelled boxes tor selection ballot
votes!)
So persistently it lingers you might cut it with your
fingers
(Oh the Civic Graft Commission and what Tam-
many denotes!).
No olfactory apparatus can withstand this fierce
afflatus,
In comparison a bone-mill but a circumstance
becomes.
'Tis a rank and pungent terror. Can you place it?
Make no error,
’Tis the good old Labor movement —and it hums!
Fighting grimly, frowning greyly, from the fold
we booted Bailey
(Oh the annual spring-cleaning, with its strife
and strafe and shocks!),
Saw in office gaily, gladly, Lang and Willis, Dunn
and Baddeley
(Oh the walk-the-plank for Stevens and the out-
you-go for Cocks !).
Better things we sensed expectant, lesser need for
disinfectant,
Nov/ our crowd had stormed the tart-shop, shaken
from the tree the plums.
But the smell grows viler, brothers, ’tis a stench
that fairly smothers,
An atrocity that absolutely hums!
There are numerous aromas. carrying their own
diplomas
(Oh the mythical Fascisti in an editorial den!).
Well-matured Limburger cheeses hardly make for
perfumed breezes
(Oh the fabled plots to nobble undenominated
men!),
Skunks are mostly an annoyance, garlic is to few
a joyance ;
Castor-oil I find repugnant, asafoetida benumbs.
But for really shrieking reeking—’tis the Labor
organ speaking—
Labor takes a lot of beating when it hums !

not uncommon; and as the building boom

There is a mortgage of £14,067 on the

that cost £355S were made to plant and
equipment, but an almost equal amount was
written off out of profits against deprecia-
tion and amortisation. The allowance for
wastage of equipment appears to be satis-
factory, and much depends on whether it is
or not. Improvement in the net profit figures
may be shown by next balance. The removal
of the business from its old stand naturally
disturbed trade, and it is largely a question
of building up a new connection. For the
present, and especially until all the letting
portion is occupied, the capital value of the
premises is too great for the turnover. This
is a handicap which time may wipe out;
meantime the outgoings seem to need check-
ing. There is fierce competition in the job-
printing and stationery trade, and close
supervision and careful costing are essential.
The market opinion of the £1 shares is not
flattering; latest quotations were under 11s.

Another splendid year. And the very con-
servative Board decided, after caution had
been duly satisfied, that 13.9 p.c. (2s. Id.
on each share paid to 155.) might safely
be distributed. Almost half of the earnings
went to swell reserves. These, at £1,312,444,
are now almost double the amount of paid
capital. They include, however. £472,000
provision for unexpired risks. The usual
allowance (40 p.c.) would call for £362.366.
That over-allowance is typical of the South
British, which has been helped to its present
position largely by the early forbearance of
shareholders in leaving profits in the busi-
ness for the greater protection of policy-
holders. (Doubtless shareholders had a
thought for themselves, too; for this was
one of the very few cos. in which, until a
few years ago, their liability was un-
limited.) On that foundation the war piled
business and profits to a dizzy height. Nowa-
days the co. writes business in most parts
of the world, and gets a big share of the
trade of the east coast of Asia, partly as a
result of the purchase, three years ago. of a
controlling interest in the Eastern United
Assurance Corp. of the Straits Settlements.
Last year's results were assisted by a better-
than-average loss-rate: —

Even the small shrinkage in the expense rate
for the year compared with its predecessor is
of value, for the tendency had been steadily
upward since 1921.
The policy-holders’ security is first class
as to both quantity and quality. On August
91 cash and gilt-edged securities alone were
in excess of the combined losses of the past
three years, and total funds were more than
twice last year’s net premium income. No-
thing can be said about the £269,100 in
“stocks, debentures and shares,” which
would look better itemised; but the other
assets are of exceptional quality :—-

Book debts . . . . . . 62,132 2A
Mortgages, once a substantial item, are now
kept at reasonable levels, although there was
a rise last year.
Shareholders have done well. Of paid
capital of £773.730 (1,031,640 £1 shares paid
to 155.) only £67,686 has come out of their
pockets; no less than £450,000 of reserves
have been capitalised since 1917. Income
from investments last year exceeded the
amount distributed in divs., which is one
reason why the market regards the scrip as
containing possibilities of further gifts. It
is a not unreasonable expectation.

The Dunedin directorate considered that
3s. 3d. on each share paid to 30s. was suf-
ficient return and sent almost as much to
reserves. Still, shareholders are not likely
to protest, for early abstinence permitted
distributions of bonus scrip amounting since
1016 to two-thirds of present paid capital,
so that the div. is equal to 324 p.c. on capi-
tal as it stood before the bonuses were
handed around. The drop in the loss rate
last year—only once in the knowledge of
the “Wild Cat” has it been lower—meant a
substantial gain in net profits, which the
lessened expenses assisted. These figures
show what has happened over a long course
of years:—

The expense rate is still not light, and it
should be possible to pull it back further;
for while taxation is high—we still have the
war to pay for although we finished using
it a long time ago—the co. is not doing much
in the way of fighting for new business.
Indeed, if ordinary rules applied, it would
have to be said that this co. has not even
held its own. considering the tremendous
rise in insurable values during the past 10
years. Actually, however, this co. hasn’t
been quite so well placed as most to show
increased business figures, because its risks
are largely marine, and there has been a
serious shrinkage in ship values since the
war-boom period. The position in respect
of shipping is weird ; for while the cost of
new British-built ships is staggering, there
are tens of thousands of tons of cargo-carriers
on offer in England at almost ridiculous
prices. It is a position which makes the
marine underwriter very cautious; and he
will be well pleased and rather surprised if
the loss rate can be kept down to an average
figure during tlie next few years.
From the viewpoint of the policy-holder,
the National of New Zealand is a Rock of
Gibraltar. At September 30 accumulations
totalled £431,636, incliiding the customary
40 p.c. provision for untexpired risks. Total
funds amounted to 34 times the year’s pre-
mium income, more than twice the amount
usually looked for. Anid for the most part
they can be readily conwerted into cash: —

The improvement in tlie co.’s holdings con-
tinues. As compared with 1924, for instance,
the amount in mortgages was reduced by
£26.63H, war-loan holdings increasing by
almost the same amount. Shareholders, too,
are snug. Interest earnings alone are suffi-
cient to pay 10 p.c. on the watered capital.

That is to say, in four years the liquid
position has gpne back £332; and what
else is thereV Certainly £2125 has been
added to property account, and probably a
few pounds mono than that may have been
spent; but on tlie other hand furniture and
effects must havje suffered a good deal of
depreciation, and] there has been some wear
and tear of premises also —no hotel building
lasts for ever. I|t is really doubtful, there-
fore, whether thef dividends paid during the
past four years tfave been earned. However,
the recent structiifal alterations are expected
to put up the ea rnings substantially; and
it is needed if the* 6 p.c. is to be maintained.
The financial position is by no means diffi-
cult : the liabilities are comparatively small,
considering, the viil ue of the property. Nor
are the earnings: bad, either, though they
ought to be better; they only look small
alongside the inflated capital.

Stocks, swollen by the purchase of two
Dunedin businesses, were uncomfortably
heavy at tlie beginning of the term, Sind the
Board decided to get them down. The result
shows in a reduction* of £50.000. It took
doing; but either the buying or the selling
was so good that the result, apart from the
desired contraction, was the fat record profit
indicated in the table, an increase in the
div., £18,374 added to reserves and the
almost total extinction of the mortgage debt.
Altogether the co. improved its position in
every way:—

One way and another it was a year of really
extraordinary performances. Without getting
in more capital, trading liabilities were re-
duced by £25,677 and a loan of £48,060
secured by mortgage was paid off. Mort-
gages on August 20 were unimportant at
£6450.
Although the co. is established in Welling-
ton, Wanganui and Christchurch and does a
Dominion-wide trade, headquarters remain
at Dunedin, its starting-point. And there
has been the Dunedin touch in its manage-
ment. The Board was not carried away by
last year's opulent result. Over-importation,
particularly of luxuries, was a danger which,
in the opinion of the directors, demanded
caution. The experiences of 1921-22 were
recalled. A recognition of the danger im-
plies, in this case, provision to meet it, and
at the annual meeting strong emphasis was
laid on the fact that stocks had been valued
on a most conservative basis and all doubt-
ful lines cleared out. “Full provision” had
been made for depreciation of premises
and plant, these appearing at £3030 less
than 1924, despite the re-fitting of the Dune-
din quarters. Expenses showed only a slight
increase. Shareholders received the cus-
tomary 24 p.c. bonus on purchases—a nice
addition to their div. return —but the aggre-
gate sum is not mentioned. The 10 p.c. div.
was worth a little more to those who shared
in the one-in-four gift issue of 1921. As
£18,374 remained after final appropriations
—equal to another 10 p.c. on ords.- —the
outlook for more 10 p.c. divs. is bright. But
with £427,854 of capital (a quarter-million
is in 6 p.c. profs. 1 shareholders should not
look for anything beyond that until reserves
are much stronger.

Of recent years (it used not be so) Austra-
lian workers in clay have shown a large
capacity for sticking together; and largely
for that reason this co.’s investments, chiefly
in subsidiaries, are very profitable. Three
years ago it received a gift of bonus scrip, and
now £9646 comes from one of these “other
companies” to help reserves along. Apart
from the windfall, the profit was not so
good, although still comfortably in excess
of the amount required for the reduced div.
The gloom of 1924 in the brick trade has now
lifted, and prospects are considered to be
much more encouraging. Meantime, although
the co. worked only three kilns, it was able
to build up its stocks; and there is some
virtue in that, for it was the incapacity of the
brick-men to cope with orders during the last
boom which assisted concrete to popularity.
Tlie co. wins a -handy profit from tiles and
pottery lines, but in those branches keen
overseas competition lias driven it to spend
a good deal of money in labor-saving addi-
tions. Compared with a year earlier there
was 110 movement of note in balance-sheet
figures, apart from the addition of the bonus
shares : ; .

Plant, stores, etc., show a reduction, .not-
withstanding the additions previously men-
tioned ; but that is accounted for by the
substantial writing down of old plant—alto-
gether £7303 of visible revenue has been
struck out during the year as a set-off against
depreciation. The liquid position on Sep-
tember 30 was strong, and, accepting the
book value of assets, there were net tangibles
of 255. 6d. to represent each £1 share. If
the promise holds, Hoffman should do well
this year. In any case it should do well
enough to pay a fair div., and to all but
very recent buyers of the scrip a fair div. is a
bit more than that because of the one-in-six
gift issue of 1924.

Brisbane City Council lias approved a
scheme for the formation of a co.
£250,000 capital to run a ferry service be-
tween the city and suburbs up tlie rl > -
The council will grant sites tor landing-
stages. Frank Torazzi, the promoter, is ai
engineer with experience in Queensland,
NS.W. and England. His scheme provides
for the running of three boats within nine
months. The vessels will be built at New-
castle (N.S.W.), and will rather resemble
floating tram-cars. But the money is yet o
be got.^
Recently the Kalgoorlie Chamber of
Mines suggested a rotary system of holidays
for employees, but the miners union was
talked into refusing to agree. Hitherto the
mines have closed down for a fortnight a
Christmas-time in order to give all hands
the prescribed annual holiday, but this has
meant serious losses. 2he Chamber reck
that under the rotary system more men
would be employed and everybody would be
better off, but the union diifcrs, and wont
change its opinion. As the rotary system
works well in other Westralian industries,
the opposition easy to understand.
Westralian Government has seized the
Bullfinch Co.’s mine and plant under a
mortgage which was given for advances
totalling £3OOO. This sum was used to
drain and sample the Gladsome Sand-Queen
Mines at Comet Vale, which the eo. was
compelled to abandon, as shareholders jibbed
at paying calls. The mine is practically
valueless under present conditions, and most
of the plant which originally cost ib7,UOU
could hardly be sold at the jirice of old iron.
Glenelg Hills (W.A.) is a field worth
watching. So far claim-holders there have
had a rough spin owing to shortage of water
and provisions. However, now that an
adequate water-supply and decent roads are
promised by the Government they look tor-
ward to better times. Meanwhile those
needing assistance under the Mines Develop-
ment Act are dinning into the Government s
ears that the hope of a gold-mining revival
in the West lies in bona fide efforts to locate
and develop new fields, and not in recklessly
spending money on the apparently dead or
dying, or guaranteeing at the bank old-
established cos. that have paid away nmre
than they ought in divs. and have nothing
left.
* * *
The requiem of Golden Hope (W.A.)
seems to be near. Following on unsatisfac-
tory prospects and dearth of market-interest
the battery has ceased work, a final clean-
up has taken place and, on the advice ot
the manager, the mine has been closed down.
To date about £85,000 has been spent on
development, plant, management, office ex-
penses, etc., without shareholders receiving
a sou, and their chances of ever getting one
are anything but good. #
Ives Proprietary (W.A.) is now playing a
lone hand in the Manxman flutter, all other
option-holding cos. having passed. The Han-
sel Mundy Go., which held an option over a
lease adjoining the Ives show on the south,
extracted 115 tons, from which 4450 z. bul-
lion worth 70s. per oz. was obtained. 4hc
gold content of the sands has not yet been
announced. It might appear strange that
Hansel Mundy should abandon ore of this
grade, but the lode from which it was won is
narrow and the country extremely hard. At
the same time, there is still money in the
show for the owners. One result of the
recent Manxman excitement is that three
cos. are in a fair position to embark on
option-hunting expeditions at Wiluna and
Glenelg Hills —centres that are expected to
attract some attention next year. Cash in
hand of these cos. is something as follows:
Radio, £5000; Radio South, £2200; Hansel
Mundy, £l5OO. Although nothing suitable
for a co. was disclosed at Manxman, a num-
ber of holders are likely to do very well for
some time. In addition there is a good
chance any day of something bigger being
struck in the district.

The once-famous, but long-abandoned
copper-mine at Burra (S.A.) has taken an-
other step towards dissolution. A grass fire
lately spread to the old engine-house. Ihe
poppet-heads and great pulley-wheel, a land-
mark of the district, crashed down, and the
fire is now running unchecked through tne
timber of the old shafts. This will make any
further exploration of the old wonder more
difficult and perhaps impossible. iwo or
three times in the last 40 years a little
stabbing has been done, but without any
success. The great deposit seems to have
been just a pocket of ore.

W. F. Lee, in charge of the N.T. Mica
Mines at Macdonnell Ranges, is on his way
to Sydney with three sample-books of raw
mica said to speak loudly for themselves.
Since taking on the job, Lee has not been
holding stop-work meetings. With halt a
dozen men he has sunk as many pros-
pecting shafts, and in connecting them
with drives has accumulated his first ton
of the mineral. Inquiries for the stuff, even
for the chips lying about the dump, are a
feature of tlie office correspondence, and the
share-market is waking to the possibilities.
Scrip is at a. premium of 800 p.c., and the
inner circle believes that public demand is
only setting in. #
The show item at the Mt. Painter and
Radium and Rare Earth meetings was the
exhibit of sewn milligrammes of radium
bromide. This featherweight was handled
by D>\ Cooke with all the pride of a fond
parent for his first-born. As it was the first
sample of the crystal turned out in Aus-
tralia it was worthy of some gush, par-
ticularly as its market value was £l2O.
Experimenting on the Mt. Painter radio-
ores is thought to be over, and the Dry
Creek works are expected to find no more
difficulty in producing 1000 milligrammes
than seven. The Radium Hill conceptrat-
ing plant is up, and everything is ready to
test the statement that February sliould
see these little shows beginning the ex-
port of their radium products. Better that
than selling the ore to foreign buyers for
treatment overseas.

Twelve months of waiting have failed to
materialise William Orr’s vision of a big
Cloncurry copper merger. So Hampden,
after skipping a half-yearly balance, now
discloses its year’s doings for review. No
work has been done on the mines save
pumping at the Trekalano. The water is
up in the Hampden to 150 ft. from the sur-
face, and in the Answer claim it has risen
to No. 1 level. The ?nly mining has been
a hit of tributing in some of the old shows.
Accordingly, ore reserves are os m 1.L.8
when Erie Huntley last totted them up. Re-
venue has flowed in from that closely-
guarded preserve, Metal Manufactures,
Pty Ltd., in which the co. now rejoices
to hold 118,078 shares. Its divs. were
£45 082 for the year, so that mine expenses
of ’about £10,500 did not cause sleepless
nights, and the £l2OO per six months needed
for board fees and salaries worried no one.
Also the banker, with his £19,500 0.D., got
his interest pat. The barebones results are
profits of £16,937 in the February six
months and £14,014 for the August term,
all of which has been spoofed olf to depre-
ciation and equalisation reserves. worked
out. the liquid position, apart from the share_-
interest in Metal Manufactures and 6310
shares in the Electrolytic Refining and
Smelting Co., which may be regarded ps in
suspense, is a surplus over debts ot £-0,<14.
Stores, fluxes and fuel at £56,276 are a
big item. What is to be the end of it all
only a full-time prophet could reveal. Mines
stand in the books at £397,018, tramways
£90.587, plant, etc., £253,497but if the
machinery-man has to be relied on cash
from there won’t figure largely. Blocks of
scrip have been soaked up steadily in Lon-
don and Australia in the last six months.
The buying may be on account of Mt. Elliott,
or for Mt. Isa, or the lure of backing Metal
Manufactures shares, which as things go
should be worth 40s. each. The mystery of
who is buying and why will doubtless be
solved soon.

“Iverogen” throws water on troubled oil:
After successfully shutting off the secondary top
waters, including presumably the artesian How met.
with in the Roma district at about 1200 feet, the
Lander Co. reports the breaking in of bottom water
in its Orallo bore at 2660 feet, just when the oil
test was to have been made. All this emphasises the
difficulties of oil-boring in artesian basins. Water
conditions in these areas have been such that any oil
deposits originally present have suffered consider-
able modification,, even if not complete replacement.
Apart from the Roma gas, which, according to the
official logs, was struck in pockets and fissures in shales,
all other indications met with in Queensland artesian
deep bores were inspissated products deep down m
the series—always unfavorable to commercial pools.
It is universally l'ecognised that water, by its sweeping,
concentrating action, accumulates oil in definite struc-
tural local ions of limited extent from enormous
masses of oil-bearing strata; and petroleum in water-
logged rocks generally occupies the highest portion
of°porous reservoirs in such rocks unless the presence
of gas prevents it. But the theory must undergo
modifications in the case of large artesian basins
such as those of Queensland. Here, on the water-
intake side of the eastern portion of the State, are
the enormous masses of beds “feeding” the basin.
These not only saturate the first porous ; reservoir, but
a large amount of percolation downwards through
fault planes, fissures, fractures, joints and other
means of communication must take place, so that
lower reservoirs ultimately become water-logged.
Assuming that oil ever existed in the series, the
downward passage of the water caused an up-dip
travel of the oil and associated gas. What more
natural than the gas occupying bulges and terraces
(if present) in the sfrata, and the oil passing on to
dissipate in the “intake beds? It will take a
lot of boring and underground contouring to defi-
nitely find such terraces, and until this is dope oil-
boring in the Walloon artesian basin or the out-
cropping jurassic and other “intake” beds is the
wildest gamble, with water troubles all the way.

The best news from Flagstone (N.S.W.)
still concerns the Cartwheel lease ot th>
parent co. McKenzie stated last week that
this section is opening up "in an exceptional
manner,” and that he considered develop-
ments “exceedingly gratifying.” In sup-
port of this view he announced that tne
crosscut has now gone 17 feet across the
lode without any signs of the other wall, and
the face is still in rich ore tor the full
width. The lode is bad shooting, making pro-
gress slow, is going strongly underfoot and
appearances indicate that it will live to any
depth. Values are worth 6 P- c - tin oxide

have been exchanged at 455., a premium ot
only ss. The explanation offered is that there
is no group of big tin men behind the show;
but the fact is that outsiders remain unin-
spired by the dilatory methods in battery
erection. It is now announced that arrange-
ments for transport of the heavier machinery
from the Butler have been made for early m
the New Year. The trouble is that arrange-
ments were made four months ago and no-
thing came of them. With tin at £--80 all
the time this appears sheer waste of oppor-
tunity-.
Vegetable Creek, Ardlethan (N.S.W.), got
114 tons concentrates from 903 tons in its

Another attempt is being made to float
Manna Hill, near StiTart Town (N.S.W.).
Four Orange directors appear m the pros-
pectus plus H. D. Mcßae, of Sussex-street.
A nominal capital of £20,000 consists of
40.000 each in ss. paid shares and ss. con-
tribs., paid to Is. on allotment. The pro-
moters ought to provide more recent data.
A. P. Penman’s report is a year old. Me
describes how the n.-w. and s.-e. reef is
the only one worth following, and it is
practically undeveloped. Further:
In the upper tunnel [about 100 ft. beneath the sur-
face] a rise shows'good grade ore. A winze has
been sunk off the reef, and about 20ft. beneath the
tunnel level a drive has just reached the main reel,
but has not penetrated it. The gold values here
are exceedingly rich, much .of the ore being m
the form of specimens. The reef here contains so
much coarse gold that, being only partly exposed, it
was considered inadvisable to sample. The genei.il
mining position of the property is that a very rich
reef has been located, but practically no development
work has been done to prove the widths or extent ot
these values.
Penman concludes that “the type of deposit
is not generally favorable to permanent
values. However, the presence of high-grade
ore renders it advisable to prospect the
occurrence.” Muckerawa Creek provides a
good water-supply. Subscribers are entitled
to be very curious as to the reason why such
rich gold has been allowed to lie unex-
ploited for over a year at one spot on the
44 acres of leases.
* * * *
Reports from Great Northern, Herberton
(N.Q.), still make cheerful reading. A fur-
ther 200 tons of good ore is stowed away for
crushing and there is more in every direc-
tion in the stopes. This shoot is close to the
porphyry dyke cutting the Gully shaft, and,
like most of the shoots on the field, is con-
nected with these intrusions. It will pro-
bably be found that the shoot will run down
to the dyke and be cut off in another bOtt.
or 70ft. unless the dyke works away off its
known course. Geologist St. Smith, who
sized up the position of the mine recently,
considers it time to be thinking of building
up a reserve fund for further prospecting.
This shoot had a narrow escape from being
discovered years ago, and the location of it
so close to former workings affords further
proof of flip advisability of testing the walls
of the many abandoned workings on the Mer-
berton field.

retains as an heirloom an ancient threepenny
bit. Many years ago its forebears came to

out a bare living by exchanging with each
other their farm produce and helping one
another in the farm work. In those days

“Eyebolt” : In the good old pioneering days
of the Speck a young Englishman and his
wife came to settle in a particularly wild
spot. The lady, accustomed to the miniature
fields of Eugland, soon languished amid the
silence and solitude of the bush ; and one day
she startled her husband by requesting that
in the event of her death her remains should
be sent “home” for burial. Hubby patted
her on the back and told her not to be silly,
but he gave the promise. And when some
years later the lady did die he had the body
sealed up in a leaden casket and placed m
an attic pending the fulfilment of his obliga-
tion. The opportunity came when No. Z
arrived on the scene, and, after having been
wooed and won, proposed a voyage to the Uld

“Old Grammar”: The arrival in Melbourne
of the first batch of “Little Brother boy
immigrants by the Jervis Bay brought a
curious crowd to the waterside, anxious to
look over “the cream of the public schools,
as one local journal fatuously described
them. The lads, who vary in age from 18 to
12 are a bright, likely lot, but those who
expected to see them landing in toppers or
Eton jackets were grievously disappointed.
One young gentleman, who brought an im-
mense pile of luggage containing three
years’ supply of clothes “of different sizes,
to fit me as I grow,” came somewhere near
the traditional article. But the
standard seemed up to that of one of tle
lads who had taken a course m butchering
before leaving. The ship’s butcher died on
the way to Australia, and the boy took his
place, earning over £2O to start his Austra-

pital; and there he died two hours later. He
had hailed a passing cab and been drive
home, but hadn’t thought it worth while
speaking about his own condition.
“Gomaoho” : 11
isn’t only the
pommy who finds
pitfalls in the Aus-
tralian language. A
Papuan planter,
writing to his wife,
who had remained
at home, mentioned
that out of his first
year’s profits he
proposed purchas-
ing a gin ; he didn’t
think it worth
while to add that
he referred to a
machine for clear-
ing cotton fibres
from the seed. P.V
return mail he re-
ceived an acidu-
lated assurance
from his mother-in-
law that her daugh-
ter wasn’t going to
play second fiddle
to a native woman.
The planter
travelled a hundred
miles along the
coast to the wire-
less station; but
being unable to put
things straight
through the air, he
covered the extra
2000 miles home.
Indifferently re-
ceived at tlie front
door by ma-in-law
he managed to ex-
culpate himself with
the aid of a dic-
tionary, but when
he gained access to
his wife the whole
clearing up had to
be gone over again.
The confusion over
a word cost him
three months’ labor
and half the sea-
son’s crop.
“Centurion”: The two old battlers who
renewed acquaintanceship in the lockup-yard
at Townsville after 14 years’ separation (B.
10/12/’25) bring to mind the experience ot
an old friend of mine. He was a rather
swanky bank-manager who had Served 12
months as a trooper in S. Africa. Returning
on the old Orient, he grew cocky as Aus-
tralia drew near and talked back to the
ship’s sergeant-major, an old 21-years’ ser-
vice Imperial man. Two minutes later lie was
shoved into a gloomy clink in the bowels ot
the ship, where he fell over another victim.
It was a fellow official in the same bank
whom he hadn’t met for, years. Congratula-
tions over, they compared notes. Said one :
“This comes of cheeking that infernal ».M.
“Same here,” acquiesced his comrade in
misfortune. “And it’s my birthday, too,
complained No. 1. “Mine, too, said the
other —“many happy returns.
“Hillmorton”: I suppose Rugby was
chosen for the site of Britain's newest and
hugest wireless station because it is some-
where near the centre of England. \ lsitors
to the Midlands from oversea are persistently
shown places which are alleged, on the
authority of the oldest inhabitant or some-
body. to be the exact centre of England—it
may be a town or a village or a lull or an
old tree —and they are nearly all in V\ ar-
wickshire. Personally I could never under-
stand or elicit, when I was shown these
geographically thrilling spots, how the resu t
or the distinction claimed was arrived at.
To ascertain the centre of a country like
England (and Wales presumably), would you
locate the particular spot that is furthest
from the sea —any sea? Or would you draw
a straight line*down the full length of Eng-
land, say from Berwick-on-1 weed to the
Isle of Wight, and another across England
and Wales at their fullest breadth, say from
Yarmouth to St. David's Head, and call the
place where they intersect the centre of the
land’ For all I know, both these methods
mav'be patently wrong. In which case how
is the problem solved? Anyway, Rugby is
near enough to the geometrical Heart o
Britain to be a good site for a wireless sta-
tion. though I have an idea that Learning-
ton stubbornly claims to be nearer.

NEW YEAR’S WISH.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
A light heart go in your pack to-day
And a careless joy to your knapsack swing;
For a light heart finds that all months are May
And a careless joy wears the smock of Spring.
And the best I can wish you this New Year
Is never to care too much, my dear!
Make no long stay in the taverned town,
But let your, inn be the blossoming tree,
The blue roof over the rolling down
And a wild-bird choir for your minstrelsy.
Let each new road wind to a place of sleep,
Nor plant the pegs for your tent too deep!
Make your walls so frail that the sun can slip
Between the chinks at the dawn of day,
And break the bowl that has left your lip
And fling its fragments to Faraway.
So you forge no chains for your ardent soul,
For who can grieve o’er an empty bowl?
Hang never a picture on your wall—
In a window frame be your pictures set!
If you kiss one mouth you must kiss them all,
So you leave no room for a grey regret;
And make no goal of a steadfast light,
But follow a firefly all the night!
Oh, the roads are easy to roving feet —
The Gone To-morrow, the Here Today!
Keep no fading blooms when fresh buds are sweet,
And cut no reed for a dream to play ;
But live each moment and let it go,
Then every wind for your ship shall blow !
QUEENSLAND.

“Verri": A story that would have de-
lighted Stevenson or Becke was brought by
the Aorangi on its last trip to Auckland.
Two days out from Fiji the ship deviated in
the direction of the lonely l'hoenix Group,
and hove to off an ocean speck known as
Hull Island. The detour was made at the
request of a Sydney firm which was con-
cerned about the plight of A. A. Schaeffer,
manager of a copra plantation there, who
with his wife, two children and 20 Kanakas
had been marooned on the atoll since liis em-
ployers went into liquidation. The Aorangi
waited until the manager canoed out to
them; then it supplied him with food and
medicines —the party had been living on fish
and cocoanuts for months —and left with a
promise to make arrangements with another
steamer for the removal of the company.
They have been there, cut off from the world,
for over four years.

“Morse”: Melbourne G.P.O. mixes fero-
cious suspicion of the outside world with an
engaging trust in human nature. If a pri-
vate person applies for a refund of fivepence

from the lordly institution, he has to fight
his way through a barricade of red tape; yet
a man who merely said he was an employee
of a big assurance co. and had lost the key
of the firm’s letter-box got away the other
morning with a bag containing hundreds of
pounds’ worth of cheques and money-orders.
In the same way the concern takes elaborate
precautions to prevent news of the Melbourne
Cup results from leaking out, while anyone
with a Morse ear—and nowadays they
swarm —can listen-in at any country tele-
graph office to the private business passing
on the wire. Similarly, identity has to be
proved to get delivery of odd telegrams in
certain circumstances, but much of the daily
correspondence is distributed by small boys
who drift through city buildings bawling
“Smith!” or “.Tones!” and handing over
their freight, without asking for a receipt, to
any passer-by who cares to call himself
.Tones or Smith.
SCANDAL IN OUR TOY-SHOP.
M RS. FOWL : “Just look at the hussy. Her hair fell off in the night, and now she's pre-
tending she's had the Eton crop!"
“Sucre”: The value of the aeroplane to
the Outback has had another almost sensa-
tional certificate. The daughter of a stock-
man at Kvnuna. between Cloncurry- and
Winton (W.Q.), was badly scalded. The
tiny local hospital was out of the necessary
palliatives. A prescription was telephoned
through to the Northern Territory Aerial
Service. Cloncurry; the medicine was put
aboard one of the service’s long-distance
piers and dropped by a parachute two hours
later. A motor-car takes .'l2 hours to bridge
the gap between Cloncurry and Kynuna.

“Centurion”: Kruger never gave war
medals to anyone (11. ; the re-
wards for military service in native scraps
were generally something more substantial,
such -ns the dead nigger’s land or cattle. Still,
many burghers who began the Great Boer
War in the ranks of the embattled Republics
finished it (and thereby became entitled to
some decoration) as soldiers of the Queen,
cheerfully helping to knock spots off their
former associates. These burgher scouts
(“Ilansuppers,” their own, folk called them)
were prisoners or surrendered men who pre-
ferred changing sides to St. Helena or
Ceylon. Under “Manie” Botha, an uncle of
Louis, they rose to a strength of some thou-
sands and did good service to the end of
the war. They received the Queen's medal
at least, and the calm way in which the
renegades and the dicliards accepted the situ-
ation after the. surrender, and fraternised
again, without any trace of ill feeling, was
an eye-opener to anyone not acquainted with
the easy-going ways of the Boer of those
times.
* * * *
“Cue”: The quaintest legal case I ever
reported was one in which a lawyer de-
terminedly set himself to prove that he had
been so drunk for a week on end as not to
know what he was doing. Regarding him-
self as the most material witness, he thought-
fully hired another lawyer to conduct the
case. The central figure in the proceedings
had been on an unusually lurid jamboree, in
the course of which he had presented several
barmaids with tokens of his maudlin afEec-
tion in the shape of brooches and rings.
When he sobered up he uncliivalrously de-
manded the return of the jewellery on the
ground that it had been wheedled out of lum
when, in his own words, he was “silly and
delirious.” or in legal parlance non compos
mentis. The barmaids, resenting the implied
slight on their womanliness, refused to hand
over the baubles and hired a third lawyer
to rebut the imputation that they had
acquired the goods by unworthy methods.
Thus the whole of the local Bar was engaged
or implicated—it is hardly necessary to
mention that this happened m the roaring
days of the W.A. goldfields—and as almost
every person connected with the six pubs ot
the township was summoned to give his or
her views as to the precise stage of
intoxication of lawyer No. 1 when he
was distributing presents to the fair, and
as everybody in the district, wanted
to hear as much of the case as he could,
the courthouse was packed and the proceed-
ings protracted for two days. There was a
mass of expert testimony, pro and con., on
the effects of assorted liquors on the human
frame and brain, and the wrangling of the
two Wigs over the exact condition of the
third, and the third's vehement protestations
that he had been as drunk as David s sow
from Monday morning to Saturday night
(except when he was asleep), combined to
lift the case out of the ordinary, lßnally
the magistrate, a thoroughly conscientious
man and something of an expert himself—
I remember that he reserved liis decision and
the story went that it took him half a bottle
of whisky to arrive at it—dismissed the
action for the return of the jewellery on the
ground that, drunk as the plaintiff had un-
doubtedly been, he was not so drunk as to
be incapable of knowing that, he was giving
things away. The verdict was generally
approved, the defendants—satisfied with
having vindicated their characters handed
back the gewgaws voluntarily, and everybody
went back to work.

“Spare Corporal”: A polite female
prisoner is now regretting an act of courtesy
to a policeman. On the way from Liverpool
to Long Bay (N.S.W.) she. gave the slip to
the John Hop who was responsible for her
safe delivery; then, feeling some compunc-
tion for putting a black mark in a consider-
ate bobby's record, she rang him up from a
telephone booth at Circular Quay to ex-
press regret’at having got him into trouble.
Then her rotten luck started. Of all people
a couple of detectives overheard her remarks;
and as she left the telephone-box she found
the Law waiting for her with open arms, so
to speak.
* * * •*
“Iford”: Better even than the alleged dis-
coveries of reputed traces of Roman-Jcwish
occupation of Arizona a thousand years ago
I like the story, printed seriously in New
York and repeated with an open mind by the
special correspondent of a London daily,
about the tribe of Indians recently encount-
ered in Panama whose “pidgin” English in-
cluded such old-flavored words and phrases
as “Gadzooks,” “Odsbodikins” and “Bestir
thyself betimes.” These interesting survi-
vals were discovered, it appears, by a pro-
fessor who is collecting for a New York
museum, and the ingenious gentleman arrived
on terms of sufficient intimacy with the tribe
to bo able to advance the plausible explana-
tion that the tags of speech had come down
from white ancestors—to wit, Bartholomew
Sharp and a mob of buccaneers who rested
from their piratic labors in Panama about
1080, and naturally used Elizabethan oaths
and phrases. If the story is a lie it is at
least a picturesque one; the Panama natives
deserve to rank with Ivipling s Thibetan who
chanted a corrupt version of Ihe Wearing
of the Green” that had been handed down in
the family from an Irish forebear who had
deserted iiis regiment in the days of John
Company to settle in those parts.
“Black Tracker” : Some years ago a well-
to-do lady who took a keen interest in a Vic.
charitable institution notified the trustees
that the home would benefit to the extent
of a thousand pounds after her death. The
good lady recently passed out, and the
trustees were anticipating a welcome addi-
tion to tlieir rather scanty funds when a com-
munication from the lawyer engaged in
administering the estate came to hand. It
was to the effect that the testator found in
the end that she could set aside only iqUU
for their benefit; but in order to keep faith
she had instructed the executors to pay
this amount into the Commonwealth Bank,
where it was to lie until the compound in-
terest brought it up to the promised thousand,
when it was to be handed over. Ihe ac-
countant is now busy calculating how long
they will have to wait for the legacj.^
“Ibn el Issar": The new Turkish civil
code, which is to supersede Moslem law as
laid down in the Koran, makes a clean
sweep of customs which have long been the
very breath of Islam. The unveiling of
women is a drastic departure, and so are
the abolition of the husband's power ot
peremptory divorce and the prohibition ot
polygamy." Both these changes will be re-
sented by the old-time Turkish woman, for
they supplied, paradoxically enough, her
chief hold over hubby. , A husband who
divorced his wife had to return her dowry ;
nor could he take any more of the four
wives which the Koran permits without the
first wife’s permission. Naturally, a wise
wife saw to it that she got liberal concessions
or privileges before she would permit the
introduction of new' spouses, who were
always under her orders. More than that,
the lady could insist that her spouse should
not entirely neglect her for the other cats.
Under the new law, Mrs. Jacko will be no
better off than a miserable Christian.
“Machete”: There is at least one British
seaman who probably wishes he had never
made an Australian landfall. He appeared
in a Melbourne police court the other day
to answer a charge of assaulting his Austra-
lifin wife*. His version showed tlint the
missus would not permit his presence at
the family seat, where she ran a boarding-
house, a matrimonial agency and a general
shop. He was exiled to a far suburban shop,
where he had to sell dubious ice-creams and
fly-specked packets of cigarettes from 7 a.ni.
to midnight. For these duties and his con-
tinued absence the lady allowed him 255. a
week. Even this and being called an idle
dog and “a pommy goat" did not bend his
proud spirit; but when she asked why he
couldn’t smoke a cheap brand of cigarettes
UNDER COMPLETE CONTROL.
“Her husband says she obeys him implicitly."
"Yes, she can make him order her to do any-
thing she wants to do.”
from the stock instead of the best, the Bri-
ton in him woke, and, as the lady came at
him with a poker, he gave her a push. The
P.M. took a risk and dismissed the case, in
the teeth of the aggrieved wife’s protests.
LABORATORY LOVE.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
“ ‘Marriage,’ Dr. Hirschfield added, ‘should not be
invested with romance. Love, being ehemica am
physical, was in the domain of the scientist, not
the popular novelist.’ ”■— Cable.
List, ye love-lorn everywhere,
Who of sonnets to your fair
Are prolific,
In these hard material days
Try to make your roundelays
Scientific.
Verses with endearments larded
Should be rigidly discarded.
List, ye rare romantic lads,
Romeos and Galahads,
Full of passion,
Yearning for a clingsome. mate!
Amorous odes are out of date,
Out of fashion.
You must put your palpitations
Into chemical equations.
Of affinities ye raved
In a frenzy fine, enslaved
By their graces.
Your attachments, you should know,
Are the same as acids show
For their bases,
Indicating early mating
By a text-book’s formulating.
Love is chemical —no more.
Nat.hless, nymph whom I adore,
Peerless Nancy,
You I cannot help but view
As the son of Montague
His fiancee.
Sweet, I fear you’d lose attraction
As a chemical reaction.

Tlie Johnstons, of old Windsor (N.S.W.),
have put up another Australian record.
Grandfather John-

succeeded J. B.
Johnston; anti after
he had sat on
Ilawkesbury’s tra-
gedies for a gener-
ation, his son Hil-
ton S. saw him to

turned home to be
appointed to the
family job.

Ages of High Court Judges: Higgins, 74;
Gavan Duffy, 73 ; Powers, 72 ; Isaacs, 70;
Knox, C.J., and Rich. 62; Justice Starke, 54.
Dr. Quick, of the Arbitration Court, is 73.
John Watson, of Mt. Gambier (S.A.), re-
puted to be the oldest newspaper editor
in harness in Australia, has passed out in
his 92nd year. He was born in Forres,
Scotland, and was apprenticed to the Forres
Gazette at 14. At 21 he landed in Mel-
bourne and got a job with the Argus. Nine
years later he joined the brothers Laurie
on the Border WatCii at Mt. Gambier, and
took charge of the literary staff. He was
the Mount's first mayor, and always a lead-
ing townsman and a pillar of "the kirk.
Watson was a friend of Adam Lindsay
Gordon, several of whose early poems were
published from the Border Watch office.
James Gartrell, just dead in Adelaide at
79, came from Cornwall as an infant, and
spent all his life in Adelaide, building up,
first with Gilbert Wood and then with Peter
Wood, the big grocery business of Wood,
Son and Co., with branches in London,
Broken Hill and all over Westralia. He
was a mighty Methodist, and presented a
whole church to suburban Rose Park. Driv-
ing was his one recreation, and though he
lived for over 40 years in a distant suburb
he claimed never to have entered a tram-
car.
“St. John’s” (Lond.) : The Weigalls
vacated Government House, Adelaide, be-
cause they “could not afford the demands
which vice-regal activities made on their
financial resources.” In England they are
spending more in entertaining in a month
than they would in a year in Australia.
They are now building a new ballroom on
to their place at Petwood, where Princess
Helena Victoria and Dame Nellie Melba
were among the guests at a recent party.
The ballroom is to be for the special delight
of Lady Weigall’s daiighter Elizabeth, who is
not yet old enough for her debut. Lady
Weigall was the only daughter of Sir
Blundell Maple, the millionaire furniture-
dealer of London, who first introduced the
“free lunch for customers.” This led to so
many abuses that the ordinary paying res-
taurant soon became a feature of all the big
department stores. Lady Weigall’s ' first
husband w r as Baron Eekarstein, of the Ger-
man Embassy, who in pre-war days was con-
sidered “the catch of the season.” The mar-
riage was not a success. Eekarstein is one
of the Prussian guardsmen who lately wrote
very pro-English memoirs.
A brass-hat who heed never be afraid of
being asked what he did in the Great War
is Bob Young, the new Maoriland G.O.C.
He may claim to have risen from the
ranks, since lie first wore uniform as a
private in the Amuri Mounted Rifles
in the old volunteering days. Later,
when he was a dentist at Marton, he got
a volunteer commission, was a captain
when the unpleasantness of 1914 broke out.
He. enlisted within a fortnight, fought all
through the Gallipoli campaign, winding up
as a temporary lieutenant-colonel. For the
rest of the war lie commanded brigades,
though advancing only to a colonelcy. He
collected some wounds and several medals in
Europe, and on returning to the Unstable
Islands joined the permanent Defence Staff,
serving as commandant first of Canterbury
District and then of the Southern Com-
mand. His promotion will be popular.
Bernard Heinze, who takes the Ormond
Chair of Music at Melbourne Uni. in succes-
sion to W. A. Laver, is an Australian pro-
duct with an overseas polish. He was born
at Shepparton (Vic.) 31 years ago, and
entered the ’Varsity Conservatorium on a
scholarship in 1912. Another scholarship
took him to the R.C.M. (Lond.), where the
Great War found him. After service in the
Royal Artillery he resumed his studies in
London, finishing off in Paris and Berlin.
Lately he has been teaching the violin at
the Con. and conducting the Symphony
Orchestra.
After 45 years’ service on the Vic. rail-
ways Bill Phelan will be retiring from his
job of employees’ representative on the Dis-
cipline Board in March next. He beat 15
candidates for the position in 1904, and has
retained it at every election since. When
he is not browbeating Clapp’s witnesses from
behind the shining table, in the board-room lie
potters about the State, filling in time as a
block and signal inspector and an examiner of
aspiring signalmen, and doing it all with a
breezy disregard of red tape.
Ninety-five years old James Entwhistle
Watkins, who died a few days ago, was the
first white man born in the Friendly Islands:
he was the son of a missionary. He saw
service in the Maori War, and at various
times traded in small brigs and schooners
between Maoriland, where lie settled in his
boyhood, and Australia. Lie could talk of
Sydney when the Tank Stream ran through
the city—his memories of the place ran back
to 1839.
Just dead at Auckland, aged 68, William
Joseph Napier, protege of, and later legal
adviser to, pro-consul Grey, as well as to the
great Maori chiefs Te Ivooti and Rewi. He
was also solicitor for the Tongan Govern-
ment, and adviser to Kings Mataafa and
Malietoa. Among other big cases Napier
handled the Samoan land suit, which dragged
on for seven years and was three times be-
fore the Privy Council. Public affairs took
a lot of his time, and he saw three years in
Parliament.
A noted blackleg passed out the other day
in Captain Richard Chugg, sometime master
of the Loch Venachar and other famous
fliers, who kept the Antiquarian book-depot
in Little Collins-street (Melb.) in his de-
clining years. He left the sea over 30 years
ago, but got hack to it again during the
maritime strike of 1918. As an able seaman
on a steamer manned entirely by retired
officers he then helped to keep up commum-
cations between Australia and the Speck.
Dr. Campbell West-Watson, who succeeds
Dr. Julius as Bishop of Christchurch (M.L.),
leaves Barrow-on-Furness in the Cold Land,
and is only the third Anglican bishop in Eng-
land to swap his job for one overseas. The
first was Dr. Awdry (a relative of Archbishop
Julius, by the way), who when Suffragan
Bishop of Southampton heard a call to South
JOAN ROSANOVE (born Lazarus), of Mel-
bourne, barrister and clever speaker.
Tokio. Awdry was replaced by another
English suffragan, Boutflower, of Dorking.
West-Watson, who is not yet 50, became
a bishop at 31, which is about as early as
possible, the prayer-book laying it down that
one must be “fully thirty yeai-s of age” be-
fore one can wear lawn-sleeves and an apron.
But West-Watson was probably the most
brilliant divinity scholar Cambridge ever
turned out. He was dean of Emmanuel at
28.
• “Feng-Shui" : As in Australia so also in
China any shopkeeper or estate-agent lias a
field-marshal’s baton in his lunch-basket. Sun
Chuan-fang, who may be the Country’s next
dictator, is a long, thin, hollow-cheeked
Shantungese who started a couple of years
ago with a handful of ragged followers
to see what soft of a living could be made
out of the revolution business. By selling
himself at the price of more munitions and
more men to each party in turn he got a
large mob together, and by a forced march
—always an effective method in the lethargic
Orient —he appeared near Shanghai a couple
of days before the time advertised in the
vernacular papers. Shocked at this disgust-
ing impropriety, his opponents refused to
fight, and he became the principal factor in
Middle China by default, as it were. He put
the position to liis defeated rival in a nut-
shell : “You are too much of a gentleman to
be a good soldier. Nobody can accuse me of
being a gentleman.” If Chang of Manchuria
is defeated, this Shantungese adventurer will
probably become the ruler of China.
“T.P.”: Versatile John Byatt, Sloyd
organiser, ex-cliief singing instructor, assist-
ant-general inspector of drawing, and organ-
iser of big summer schools and monster edu-
cational exhibitions, will shortly retire from
the Vic. Education Department, in which he
has been a sort of Pooh-Bali, with the rank
of Senior Inspector. Over a quarter-century
ago Director Tate imported him to organise
the Sloyd system of manual training. The
appointment was only for a short period, but
the chief recognised the value of the new
arrival’s passion for detail, love for crossing
“t’s” and dotting “i’s,” and power to save
pence. Tate with vision and imagination
and Byatt with his capacity for the'minutiae
of routine did big things together. Now, 65
years young, Byatt will take up church
work, for which he has been preparing for
years in his scanty leisure. Only recently
lie took high honors in Scripture Hebrew.
The winning by North Melbourne branch
of the A.N.A. of the championship in the
tournament debate recalls that the same
branch scored a similar victory 30 years ago
when it had as its team ex-Speaker Willie
Watt, M.LI.R.; Mick Brennan, LL.M., now
dead, one of the brainy family of journalists
and lawyers ; and C. Douglas. Of the team
just successful (Davidson, Galwell and
Lewis), Galwell has political aspirations.
He would surrender his snug Treasury job
any day for a metropolitan Labor seat.
“8.D.K.C.” : Mr. Eighteen (B. 3/12/’25)
isn’t the only person with a numeral for a
name. There are two or three families in
Melbourne suburbs answering to the name
of Forty.
Hjortli, the somewhat immature M.L.A.
for Bulla (Vic), and Hogan of Warrenheip,
one of the State Labor party’s long-distance
orators, were recently told off to form a
branch of the Labor League in a hamlet
where no-e had previously existed. Nervous
over his job, Hjortli enlarged on Labor's
desire to secure better hours for the worker,
but, becoming confused, referred repeatedly
to “the 44-liour day.” Hogan followed with a
speech which lasted an hour and a half. The
branch was formed ; but its organisers drew
a blank when they invited an old swaggie to
join. “No blanky fear !' he answered. “Here
is one of these windbags ’d work a bloke to
death, and the other’d talk him to death.
It's no good to me.”
A unique record is that of L. Noseda,
for 51 years official hairdresser to Geelong
(Vic.) Grammar School. During the half-
century he has attended every Wednesday
afternoon while school was in session to
barber the lads.
There is no accounting for tastes. Canon
Wise, the Highest Church Anglican of Adel-
aide, f§tcd by his church at suburban Good-
wood on the 25th anniversary of his start-
ing work there, was presented with a gold
watch and a cheque. The latter he promptly
promised to spend on a wireless installation.
“It is about time I heard some sermons,” he
said.
Mrs. Bleasby, of Brighton (Vic.), re-
elected the other day as president of the
Association of Ladies’ Benevolent Societies,
is the only daughter of the late Tommy
Bent, onetime Premier, and his unofficial
lieutenant in many campaigns. She still
lives at Brighton—dad’s constituency for the
best part of 38 years.
“H.II.”: The late ,T. H. Maiden’s
humor (P,. 19/11/’25) was tinctured
with some irascibility. He was “blowing
off ” hotly about loafers who would
neither work nor go to the war one day in
Sydney’s Hyde Park as I was passing'.
A journalistic opportunity suggested itself,
and my offer to take a job resulted in
(1) a day’s not unenjoyable work in
the open air, (2) an urgent invitation to
come back for more next day, backed by a
hint of “good prospects in a regular job,”
and (3) a “special” in a Sydney daily on a
day’s work in the Garden—“ The Craft of
Adam,” I called it. I met him again a
little later, lie protested that a trick had
been played upon him, resenting it as an
affront to his dignity, and for a couple of
days I don’t think there was an angrier
man in Sydney.
In Melbourne, to inspect Victorian hospi-
tals at the invitation of the Government, is
Dr. Malcolm T. McEachern, a big medicine-
man in Canada and U.S.A. Those two coun-
tries have autocratically applied to hospital
administration the principles of standardisa-
tion which Ford applied to motor-cars. About
3400 hospitals come under the scheme, which
is claimed to have
had the effect of re-
ducing the stay of
patients from an
average of 22 days
to 14, with conse-
quent saving of the
public’s money;
and the death-rare
has declined from
between 40 and
50 per 1000 to be-
tween 20 and 30.
The institutions are
not asked to sink
their individuality,
but even in setting '
a dislocated femur'
are compelled to
adopt a high and
defined standard.
The visitor, who
was born in
Canada, has been
in charge of these
activities.
Dr. MALCOLM
T. McEACHERN.
The vice-president of St. Pat.’s College,
Manly, Father John Nevin, besides being a
D.D. and a D.G.L., owns a Croix de Guerre
with palms. He earned the last decoration,
along with a wounded leg that had to be
amputated, when he was chaplain to an Eng-
lish regiment in the Great War. He was
at one time vice-rector of the famous Propa-
ganda College in Rome.
Glenelg, where South Aus. was “pro-
claimed” as a separate province on Decem-
ber 28, 1836, finds the list of persons actu-
ally present on that occasion exhausted, and
the list of pioneers earlier than 1840 getting
thin. It has just- intimated that any arrival
-—native-born or by vessel—earlier than 1847
can claim a special welcome next “2Sth”;
and all those who were on the scene not later
than 1850 are invited to register their names
with a view to future promotion.
A SONG OP PROGRESS.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
“A well-known squatter who went to the Gulf 60
years ago by bullock-dray flew recently to Charle-
ville.”
Land of the treeless plain, land of the rolling down!
Sixty years like a dream have fled,
Sixty years in a flash have sped,
Since first he yoked up his stout ox-team
And faced the drought and the swollen stream
Out where the plains are brown.
Month by month did his waggon creak
Over the wild unknown;
Night by night did he watch the stars
Pointing him out his own.
Coarse and rude was his daily fare,
Flour and beef were his ration spare-
pipe of the weed as well.
And at the end of an eight months’ road
See him bend and at last unload,
Glad of a breathing spell.
Tent and hut by the stream uprose;
Hammer and axe were loud.
Daily clamored the hungry crows
Up in a wheeling crowd.
Stock were turned on the Mitchell grass,
Curious black men watched them pass,
Spearing a beast or two.
Rifle crack, when the word was vain,
Warning gave; if a beast was slain
Woe to the hand that slew !
Rose a home by the Gulf-bound wave
Girt with a garden fair;
Neighbors came with the flight of years,
Women brave who had lost their fears
Shared the lot of the pioneers,
Life was no longer bare.
He who came with a waggon rude
Rode out now with a sturdy brood,
Boys and girls of the blithest mood,
Free and devil-may-care!
Yesterday from his Northern home
Down to the South he flew !
Left his herds for a Vickers ’plane—
Seemed to some like a trip insane
Up in the steely blue!
Bullock-dray and a weary road
Out in the western sun!
Sixty years since he turned to roam.
Now he sees in the tender gloam
Flocks and herds and a smiling home
Speaking his life’s “well done.”
Hearts, strong hearts of the pioneers,
Yours was the foresight true.
Somewhere back in the bygone years
Visions of this had you—-
Airships cleaving the cloudless blue,
Ships that waited for yours and you;
Tell us not that you never knew.
Back of your sorrows and joys and tears,
Hearts, strong hearts of the pioneers,
Back of it all you knew!
QUEENSLAND.

“S.C.”: The seeds of many garden plants,
such as larkspur and lupin, are poisonous, and
wild birds of vegetarian diet seem to know it as
well as we do. Peaceful doves, parrots and finches
often feed in my garden, in which the seeds of
the plants aforesaid are allowed to fall thickly;
.vet, so far as can be ascertained, there have been
no deaths among such birds from this cause.
Certain domestic chooks, however, which, loudly
protesting, were driven forth from this garden
at least twice a day, began to sicken, and eventually
died mysteriously, though the final symptoms were
those of heart-failure. The seeds, and sometimes
other parts, of the plants mentioned contain an active
principle which acts as a heart-poison. The fruits,
berries or seeds of certain native bush-plants—
such as the so-called “deadly nightshade” (Solarium
semi-armatvm) are also highly poisonous, and wild
birds apparently instinctively avoid them. This
prickly plant has a purple flower like that of the
spud of commerce, also a member of the family
Solanaceae. The seeds of the false castor-oil plant
( Stramonium ) are also suspected at times of causing
deaths among cattle and horses, but birds won't eat
them.
* * * *
“Fitz”: There was a time in Australia
when cheese was made in presses fashioned out of
tree-stumps. One of these old machines is still to be
seen at Cundletown, on the Manning (N.S.W.) —
a time-worn stump perforated by a big mortise hole
through which the lever was worked. It is a
tradition amongst the old inhabitants that this
particular press was also used for squeezing locally-
grown tobacco-leaf into plugs, but if so the local
taste in cheese-flavorings must have been peculiar.
* * * *
“X2X": Throughout the Pacific malaria
is not found on the coral islands, but occurs only
on those of older structure. Why this should be is
a puzzle, for many of the coral islands, especially
the larger ones, are not lacking in suitable breeding-
places for the anopheline mosquito, and on some of
them the insect is found in numbers. Nor are hosts
for the malarial organism wanting, for on many- of
the coral islands there are men who have been
infected, previously with the disease. Yet even when
these are living in places where anopheles are
occasionally seen, there is no dissemination of the
complaint. One strange feature of this phenomenon
is that it applies apparently only to the Pacific.
The American bacteriologist Stitt and others have
reported that they found endemic malaria on islands
of coral structure and origin in South American
waters, with every indication that the disease had
existed there for a long time.
“Jesmond”: For an anti-ant mixture tel!
“Jimmy Possum” (B. 3/12/’25) to dissolve the
tartar emetic in a little water before mixing with
jam, honey l or molasses. It is almost impossible to
dissolve it direct, and, no matter how finely the
drug may be divided in the carrying medium, if it
is not dissolved the ants will reject it. The best
plan is to make a saturated solution of the antimony
salt, warm up the jam to make it fluid, then stir
the two together until cold. Though some of the
antimony may be precipitated in the process, there
will still be enough left to lay out any ant that
samples it,
* * * *
“Buttenderry”: In the recent discussion
on ringbarking no mention has been made of “frill-
ing.' which, to my way of thinking, is the best
merhod of all. Instead of removing a strip of bark
the collar-cut—the axe is driven downwards into
the tree at an angle of about 45deg., and then
wrenched away, so that it loosens and ■ pulls away
with it a frill of bark and sapwood. It is very
much quicker and easier than the collar-cut, requiring
only about a third of the number of cuts, and, if
carefully done, is more effective, since the frill holds
a good deal of moisture after rain, and this seems
to start a surface-rot. When the sap is up, as
shown by the bark stripping freely—generally after
soaking rains—is the safest time.'
“2d.”: One of the remarkable features of
the Speck’s west coast is the “drawback,”r a-strange
regular advance and retreat of the sea, distinct from
the tidal motion. The waves, breaking well up
the” beach, move back till they are'a hundred feet
or so further out, then steadily return •to their
original position and again retreat. I have noticed
the same thing on a much smaller scale on a salt-
water estuary, and on an even smaller* scale on a
• swiftly-flowing inland river. Perhaps the enormous
•area of ocean, stretching more than half-way round
the world, from Tasmania to Patagonia, has some-
thing to do with the large scale which it assumes
on the west coast.
* * * *
“C. Coral”: A big-follow shark is to bo
seen near Murray Island (Torres Strait) from time
to time. Ilis length is computed at 40ft.; when
last spotted he was disporting himself between
Murray and the Barrier. The crew of the fishing-
boat which he eyed inquisitively was not anxious
to continue the acquaintance, and didn’t attempt to
hook him. It was off Edithburgh (S.A.) that a
mere youngster of 22ft. or so rammed and sank
a fishing-cutter some years ago, the two men in it
having a narrow escape; and the islanders are not
takihg any risks. Shark-fins, by the way, are worth
money now; a couple of sets the other day, taken
from 1 Oft. or 12ft. sharks, brought 22s 6d. in Thurs-
day Island.
“Dorai” : “Morob” (B. 12/11/’25) may be
right about the South Sea islanders using stones that
are non-conductors of heat for their fire-walking;'
but I can assure him that the Tamils in the Malay
States really do walk on fire. For their big four-day
festival, Tivalli, a trench about 18ft. long, 10ft.
wide and 4ft. deep is dug. Some days beforehand
this is filled with wood, which is set on fire. On
the day it is a bed of red-hot ashes. The Tamils
who are to walk through the fire drape therhselves
in a yellow cloth, and as a rule run round and
round the edge of the trench until they have , worked
themselves into a fit mental state to take the plunge.
Then they start from one end and walk through
18-odd feet of these burning embers ; but they don’t
loaf on it or discuss the price of rice en route. I
did not examine their feet after, but three days later
they were all working. I saw this on an estate in
Perak.
“Wingella” (N.T.) : Has Keith K. (B.
21/9/’25) ever heard a group of niggers eorroboreeing?
If he has he will know that they can obtain a very
Wide range of notes from the bidgerydoo or drone-
pipe. But he ought to hear an expert at it. It. is
SCHOOL’S IN.
“You naughty boys, you must not teach Polly such words.”
“That's all right, missus. Polly’s teaching us.”
played in the same way as a cornet, by vibrating
the lips ; but the bidgerydoo is elevated or lowered
to help in extending the range of sound. Bidgerydoos
vary in length ; I have seen them from three to
seven feet long, and made from various, substances
a cow’s horn, a piece of piping, a hollowed piece
of wo6d or a hollowed-out length, of bamboo may
be used. Often they are '.carved and painted. Prob-
ably the niggers got the idea from listening to the
drumming of the emu, and copied the head and neck
of the bird. Certainly there is a great similarity
in the sound, though in the hands of an artist the
bidgerydoo is nearly as vocal as a violin.
“ Jumbuck”: In reply to “Saaodi,” who
lately wanted to know how black sheep were bred,
my grandfather, Richard Whiticker, of Jellingrco
station, Tumblong (N.S.W.), bred black sheep for
years,>and between 1890 and 1900 shore as many as
12,000 of them in a year. If .white ewes are mated
with black' l rams they will produce only about five
per cent, black lambs, but those white lambs mited
again with black rams will produce 95 per cent, of
black lambs.
“Canar” : In the early days in New
Guinea men whose work took them much out into
the bush alone used to carry small tubes of potas-
sium cyanide/ so as to be able to avoid, if necessary,
the slow tortures of the cannibal cooking-fires.
One man, who died only a couple of years back,
was captured by cannibals and taken to their village,
where preparations for a banquet were started. He
made several unsuccessful attempts to escape, and
had eventually come to look upon his plight at
hopeless. In the lining of the band of his trousers,
however, he had a gelatine capsule filled with cyan-
ide, and he determined that this should make his
death a quick one, instead of one that might: take
a day or longer to effect. On the very day on which
the feast was to begin he was rescued by a party
of white men—luckily before he had broached his
capsule.
* * * *
“Morob”: Amongst the Now Guinea
natives love-potions are not unknown. They are
designed for use when one or other of the • lovers
has started to show signs of coldness or has failed
to respond to the advances of the other. Generally,
these potions are of vegetable origin, and can be
administered in any wav,, such as by putting them
in the tobacco of a cigarette ahout to be smoked,
or in food likely to be- devoured by the object of
attentions.. It is said that they nearly always
succeed in • producing in a short time the desired
and because of this the native puts unbounded
trust in them. Scientific examination of the plants
from which they are made has not, however, dis-
closed the presence of active principles of a chemical
nature such as might bring about a result by ordinary
physiological means. It is more, than probable that
their action is purely psychic, depending, in the
fiative mind, on 1 the particular methods used in the
preparation of them.
“Wingolla” (N.T.) : “AdeL” (B. l/9/’25)
says “bamboos are not easily got in the saltwater
country.” If so, the saltwater country east of
Darwin differs from the saltwater country west of it.
Round about Darwin itself great clumps of bam-
boos grow within a few feet of high-water mark —
bamboos that w r ere growing before the white man set
foot in the country. Down along the western coast,
also, bamboos grow in millions; I never met a
saltwater nigger who couldn’t find all the bamboo
spear-hafts he needed.
“Lp North': I've watched an abo. do
some energetic burrowing to get at scrub turkeys’
eggs. In the older nests the mound of soil, twigs
and leaves goes to a depth of 10ft. By the season
and the nest’s appearance, any bushman can give a
good guess as to the
likelihood of eggs. To
make certain the abo.
scoops a hole 2ft. deep
and works his spear
as an auger through
the matted leaves, if
the withdrawn point is
yellow, then he gets to
work after the fashion
of a burrowing dog,
head and shoulders
down, leaves flying in
a shower. As he delves
deeper, half his body
hangs in the hole, and
he clings to the crater -
1 ike edge with his
knees. The mouldy
leaves and earth come
up smoking with de-
cay. Occasionally his
clawing hands grip the
twisting body of a
snake; fat yellow and
green centipedes
seutter across h i s
wrists: for variety a
scorpion may clench
on his naked, sweating
hams. But it’s all in
the day’s work, and
Binghi smiles when he
introduces his teeth to
the luscious eggs below.
Some prospector friends
of mine found in one
of the Cape York Pen-
insula scrubs a tur-
keys’ mound which
held in its centre the
inverted skeleton of
some lonely abo. who
had been engulfed by
the loam while burrowing.
* ' * * *
“Dobotte”: It happened on the N.S.W.
North Coast. We were living at the foot of a
mountain, it was midwinter, and the dingoes were
very venturesome. Dad had an old nag he had
turned out in a back paddock. Having occasion to
go there, rounding up bullocks early one morning,
he was shocked to see the old chap just about
breathing his lakt ; one side of his neck had been
torn away from jaw to collarbone. The hungry
brutes had evidently taken advantage of his feeble-
ness and attacked him. On hearing Dad’s voice he
attempted a faint whinny, and we answered his
call by giving him decent burial.
* * * *
“Mike” : An unborn baby whale two inches
long is exhibited in San Francisco by Charlie Miller,
a professional whaler. He captured it when a big
60-ton mother whale was brought into the station
at Bay View (Wash.) recently. Miller plans to
send the tiny whale to the Smithsonian Institute,
whose secretary is credited with the declaration
that the smallest embryo whale heretofore recorded
was 4Jin long. Twofold Bay (N.S.W.) or Motueka
USEFUL TO THE END.
“What’s become of the Rev. Mr. Noddle?”
“Died of consumption.”
“Poor chap! When did it happen?”
“At the close of his missionary career.”
(M.L.) may have something to say hereon, Miller's
whale, by the way, has perfectly developed legs.
Whales are mammals, and even full-grown whales
have atrophied legs. Through thousands of years of
evolution the limbs have gradually dwindled, until now
they can only be seen on a grown whale when it
is dissected.

THE CHOOKS.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
Oh, who has counted the songs that tell of the
pride and speed of the horse,
Of the races run and the trophies won on many a
crowded course ?
Or who has numbered the moving tales of the , dog
that was true and brave,
Who saved a life or found a child or died on his
master’s grave ?
We learned them first when we heard at school of
the Arab’s farewell to his steed, .
Or when to the tale of Llewellyn’s dog we gave our
childish heed ;
But though I have studied the bards since then and
searched through a thousand books,
I have found no ode to those friends of man, the
humble and homely chooks.
When I eat my eggs and toast in the morn I think
of the faithful hen,
And how through a hundred centuries she has offered
her gifts to men.
In the tropic heat of the cold Far South, in the
climes of the West and the East,
She has made her home in a thousand lands and
labored for many a feast.
In lonely places and out-back farms where the toils
are hard to endure
She has softened the rigors of life and called to the
big bush epicure ;
And when I have filled my head with songs of the
breeze and the purling brooks
I often wonder why no one yet has chanted an ode
to the chooks,
OUR REMARKABLE FAUNA.
COCKY: “Yairs, there’s plenty of sport about
here. The other morning a bloke got up
at three o’clock and shot a kangaroo in
his pyjamas.”
CITY VISITOR: “Good heavens! However
did it get into them?”
The notes of the lark as it wings the sky have a
thousand songs inspired,
While the nightingales in the woodland shades have
many a writer fired;
And oft we have heard of the lilt of a bird that has
wakened the longing for home
In the exile sad who had tramped as far as the
world held roads to roam.
The sparkling wine that is famed in song would
fill up a thousand kegs,
But never a poet has written yet a sonnet of ham and
eggs.
So the time is ripe for a golden rhyme that will
shrine in immortal books—
A song that will sing for well-fed men the praise
that they owe the chooks!

The shade of the ferns!
When it's near 100° in the shade in the city how one longs
for the fresh cool air of the hills, the welcome shade of the
fern gullies. Motorists are to be envied their opportunities
of quickly getting away from the heat and turmoil of the
city. Independent of train or tram they can reach their
objective in the minimum of time, in comfort, and at.a
particularly low cost of transport. There’s no doubt the
automobile brings a new zest into the family life. It should
not be forgotten that the service and pleasure derivable
from motoring is after all dependent on the quality and
staunchness of the tyres used. Motorists can free them-
selves from all anxiety in this direction by always using

“J.D.C.”: When Bill McClure was carting
wool from Huntawang a few years ago he ran into
a streak of hard luck. The night before he left with
his last load one of his horses fell into the
station dip. Bill found him next morning, but
by that time he was nearly settled. With the
assistance of several men, a block and tackle and
much blasphemy, the horse was dragged out. Most
of the hide had been worn off his body during his
frantic struggles, and as the weather was bitterly
cold, with little feed about, Bill offered to sell him
for five bob. Finding no takers, Bill led him over to
the slaughter yard, greased him care-full}', and slung
four newly-killed pelts over his back, skin side in,
and tied them on with binder twine. “They’ll dry
on ’im,” said Bill, “an’ will ’elp to keep the
poor blighter warm. Anyway, ’e’ll ’ave to take ’is
chance.” The horse was turned into a back paddock,
and Bill pulled out with his team one short. It was
nearly a year later when he got back to Huntawang.
He found the horse in the same paddock, fat and
Well; but, in place of the skins drying on him as
he had anticipated, they had become grafted on to
the horse’s raw body, and now’ took the place of his
natural hide. When Bill got him back to the shed
it took two fast shearers nearly 25 minutes to knock

“Mephisto”: A sight as rare as a comet
is that of iridescent clouds. Last year I saw them
twice. A large patch appeared at noon above
Brisbane last July, and shortly afterw’ards I saw a
smaller cloud at Canungra (S.Q.). They had all
the colors of the rainbow; there was one long streak
of blue and green, with touches of pink. These
clouds are the highest known. The moisture con-
denses in the form of tiny ice-particles because of
the intense cold, and these cause the iridescence.
“DON’T GET SCARED, MISSUS, I’VE
GOT ’IM!”
“The Rumpus”: Years of meeting willy-
willies in the nor’-west of W.A. has taught me there
are more than one sort. The ordinary is a sedate
fellow with an average diameter of three miles, and
travels as steadily as a policeman on his beat. He
is slow, but thorough, picking up every little trifle
in his track and giving it a good airing. Once a
pair of these dignified monsters accompanied me for
10 hours with my teams, one on each side, like red
escorts, within hailing-distance, but never interfer-
ing with my belongings. With evening, however,
came the end of their pomp and majesty, and I felt
that I had parted with a couple of friends. Other
breeds, spinning like massive tops, describe circles
of their own irresponsible creation and are difficult
to dodge. The moderate willy-willy may content
itself with lifting your lid; the militant will take
the dust from under your very feet. The worst
sort is the little snorter, never more than half a
mile in diameter, but changeable as a woman is
supposed to be, made up of separate little willies—
dozens of them —each with a sting of its own.
“Larrapinta”: I agree with “1.L.1.” (B.
26/11/’25) that the Queensland hornet can galvanise
animals into marvellous activity. In ’B6, while
I was droving from Brunette Downs to Isisford, our
cattle suddenly went mad when we struck the tele-
graph line which runs from Boulia to Winton.
With swishing tails and flapping ears they rushed
in all directions, making for the bush. We couldn’t
account for their behavior until one of our black-
boys, pointing to the telegraph line, which was
humming as a long stretch of wire sometimes does,
yelled: “Bullock think that pfeller old-man hornet!”
“Lilli-Pilli”: While boating on the Tweed
River, Brown and Potts, of Sydney, were struck by
the tameness of three wild ducks. “Why, a man ’d
nearly hit ’em with an oar,” commented Brown.
“Let’s try,” said Potts; and the chase started. It
was good fun, and as one big black duck with a
red head seemed to be tiring they persevered. \
whiskered individual on the bank seemed to be
taking a great interest in the chase. Every time
Brown stood up and smote the water where the
black duck had been Whiskers seemed to yell
encouragement and dance with excitement. Towards
sundown Brown and Potts, thoroughly tired, rested
on their oars, while the ducks floated calmly 20
yards away. Whiskers roared something across the
water which sounded like an offer to shoot the
birds, and the hunters signalled a glad assent.
THE PLEASURES OF MOTORING.
DAD (at the wheel): “If I’d had a cow-catcher attachment I’d have got her!”
MUM: “Yes, what a pity! It’s such a job to keep baby amused.”
They watched the old chap stride over to his house
and return carrying something. They saw him place
the object to his shoulder and produce a puff of
smoke from it; but before the expected report
reached. them a bullet had chipped a piece off the
side of the boat. “He’ll never hit ’em —he’s a rotten
shot,” remarked Potts, disgustedly, as they pulled
away a bit. The next, bullet splintered Brown’s, oar,
and the next pierced the boat just above the water-
line. . Then, without waiting for more, the hunters
dipped their oars and. kept dipping them energetically
until a bend of the river hid them from view of the
shooter. The policeman grinned when they indig-
nantly recounted their experience to him. “Of
course,” he said judicially, “the old beggar shouldn’t
have fired at you; but you had no right to chase his
museovies,”

“Jim Carew”: I know, an Upper Hawkes-
bury River orchardist who, has a big demijohn of
whisky over 60 years old. When his father first
went there, in the late ’fifties, a neighbor who was
famous for- his home-made whisky presented him with
the filled demijohn in return for some small service
rendered. The recipient was a teetotaller, corked .the
demijohn securely and left it under the house. When
the old man died a few years ago his son remembered
this whisky and retrieved it. It is now a beautifully
mild, mellow spirit, very different from -what it was
at first. In the days when the Hawkesbury district
was noted for its, illicit distilling the whisky from
there was frequently called “wild cat,” It was
alleged to bite all the way down, and scratch all
the way back.
* * * *
“Brady”: Ever try salve-wood berry for
sores and cuts ? The tree flourishes in parts of
Tasmania, where its healing powers are well known
to track-cutters and prospectors. It is only neces-
sary to crush the tiny balsam-scented berries between
thumb and finger and apply them to the wound, and
the flesh heals in no time.
*** * *
“Morob”: Although lightning, as a rule, is
entirely haphazard in its choice of a striking spot,
there are areas which possess a peculiar attraction
for it. Near Rockhampton (Q.) there is one on the
side of a small hill. In the last dozen years or so it
has been struck at least five times. Most of the strokes
have hit trees first, afterwards throwing up miniature
furrows around the foot of the tree, but one or two
have struck the ground directly. The existence of
other similar patches has been reported. One
explanation may be that in the earth beneath the
surface there are deposits of some mineral exercising
a magnetic attraction. The reason that the trees
are struck first is simply that, being wet, they are
good conductors.
* * * *
“Adelaide”: On one of Kidman’s stations
—Mundowdna, in the far north of South Aus. —
horses have been declared a pest and wiped out.
There is no money in horse-breeding out back now,
and the station is being converted, at big expense in
the matter of fencing and water conservation, for
sheep ; it is computed it will carry 16,000. Hunters
have been out with rifles after the horses, and the
run is now “clear” of them, after a slaughter of
about 2000 since last March.

“Gouger” : The abo. witch-doctor, like the
members of the 8.M.A., must obtain his degrees.
He must be versed in the sciences of the super-
natural and in the ait of instilling credulity and
fear of causing death. What often happens is that an
ambitious native becomes “possessed.” He shows
aversion to company, indulges in long silences and
takes lonely walks into the bush with bowed head.
Then he disappears, perhaps for a month, to return
with elastic step and radiant face. Something
wonderful has happened to him. ,A capable liar of
my , acquaintance described the “something.” For
long he travelled in the quiet places, all alone,
except that he felt "one of the big spirits compelling
him on. At last, faint with thirst, he bent to
drink at a calm waterhole. As his lips kissed the
liquid it clouded inky-black, and the frightened man
staggered to a further waterhole. As he bent to
drink, the same thing happened, only, high above,
through the’' stillness of the bush, there sounded
the beating of giant wings. Terror-stricken, he
looked up. There was nothing there, only in the
far blue a tiny insect that he could never have seen
with his ordinary eyes. Dying of thirst, he crawled
to the last waterhole, and his lips bent: to drink.
The water darkened instantly, and he groaned as his
throbbing head was, slowly lifted up. Gazing fiercely
down from above was a monstrous eaglehawk, and
the shadow of its mighty wing's darkened the water,
1 For long minutes the bird’s piercing eyes searched
his soul; then, satisfied, the bird spoke and told him
that he should be the greatest witch-doctor among
tert tribes. He would be given the magic stones
that would imbue him with the power of. life and
death and the mystery of speaking with' the spirits.
The eagle then commanded him to drink. The terri-
] fled man bent to drink. The water quivered, and the
open mouth of a fish bobbed up, pushing aside the
blackness. He drank long gulps of cool, clean water
that shot up from the fish’s mouth and felt little
hard lumps of fire speeding down his throat. These
were the sacred stones, of which his belly was now
full. That was the gist of my abo. friend’s tale,
and 600 men and women implicitly believe him.
* * * *
“Koolmara”: Walking home the other
evening, I was overtaken by a gentleman in a sulky
who offered me a lift which I gladly accepted.
My friend, who handled the ribbons in quite a
masterly manner, informed me that he was seven
years old ; also that he was quite used to driving
and fully conversant with the rules of the road.
On being questioned as to the latter, he proudly
imparted the following information. “When meet-
ing another vehicle pull to the left, and when
passing one always do it on the driver’s side. Give
all heavy traffic the full road, and if you see a lady
coming, driving a motor, get as far off the road
as you can without vesting time.”
* . * ■* *
“J.S.L.” (N.T.) : There was a big cor-
roboree some time back at which I was present, and
iubras from several different tribes were dancing in
it. After every dance the bucks from other tribes'
present walked over to the women and laid bundles
of spears at their feet. When I asked the reason
for this I was told: “Before, him no more country-
man longa him, him all time fight. S’pose him
givum spear, him makum good friend now; can’t
fight longa him.” Seemingly the idea was that the
women kept the spears and the men were weaponless,
compelling friendship with the tribes that before
they had regarded with enmity.
“Slam”: In spite of our many “living
fossils,” most of our wild life is comparatively
recent; but the dingo roamed Australia millions of
years ago, long before man appeared on the earth.
Originally a wolf-dog of Asia, he came south over
an ancient land-bridge in Pliocene times, and fossil
A DREADFUL POSSIBILITY.
REBECCA : “I tell you I saw him put one of
the animals in his mouth and swallow
it.”
ISAAC: “Ooh, I hope it vas not the pig!”
dingo-bones have been unearthed from great depths,
associated with the bones of enormous marsupial
lions and giant wombats. When the diprotodon fed
along warm, muddy margins and the 34ft. allosaur
preyed upon the 65ft. brontosaur of ancient Aus-
tralia, the dingo was on the scene. A few restored
specimens of those slow and stupid monsters may be
seen in our museums, but the dingo is still putting
up a fight.
* * * *
“Coot”: What’s the origin of the term
“Cock-eyed Bob” applied in the West to a thunder-
storm ?
* * * *
“Jacey”: One of Binglii’s characteristics
is his stoical indifference to pain. Out of many
instances one always remains vividly in my mind.
Near Nyngan (N.S.W.) a Binghi who was helping
to saw wood got his left arm mixed up in the cross-
cut, damaging it very badly. The arm was treated,
but a few days later began to mortify. It was
then decided that the only thing to do was to ampu-
tate the limb at the shoulder. It was impossible
to get the patient to a doctor, and with the aid of
a medical book the station manager undertook the
job. He had no anaesthetic to use, but made a
success of the operation. All the time Binghi lay
on the table he never even flinched.
* * * *
“Mag”: Where does “Cartot” (B,
l/10/’25) get his theory that meteors when leaving
their starting-points are molten? The realms of
space in which they travel are icy-cold and friction-
less, and there is nothing to melt them. Does “Car-
tot” believe they are really throw-outs from the
moon, sun or planets? Even if it were so, there
would be not one chance in 100,000,000 of one
reaching pur atmosphere. In my view, meteors are
really prodigals making a compulsory return, after
thousands of years of space-wandering through a
vigorous kick-off, to a cooled-down parent.
* * * *
“Polycarp”: Has it ever been noted by
the bird-men that the lyre-bird cannot fly? From
long life in dense scrub-country the legs have
been developed at the expense of the wings, and
I’ve seen a male bird leap easily from the ground
to a horizontal limb 6ft. high. They use their wings
in volplaning, buit I’ve never seen a lyre-bird fly
upwards yet, even when hard-pressed. Perhaps
this explains the placing of the nest on a hillside
slope with a taking-off ledge in front.
* * * *
“Coot”: So-called white ants are neither
ants nor white. They are termites, and, when
adult, are variously pigmented. Their communal
existence is practically the only thing they have
in common with ants. Unlike the male ant, which
usually dies after its brief nuptial flight, the male
termite lives on in the nest with the female. Should
anything happen to the male and female, certain
undifferentiated termites in the nest are transformed
into reproductive insects, and thus perpetuate the
species.
TINS.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
Step forth when you will from the streets of the
town
To court the Far West in her raiment of brown,
Or seek for a treasure by tracks that are strange,
Which beckons you east of the farthermost range;
Get mounted and trek from the wheel-furrowed South
To breast the swift torrent or conquer the drouth;
And, search as you may for a spot that is new,
You’ll find other men have been there before you.
Black ashes are left for the pilgrim to see
Where strangers have camped ’neath a rock or a tree.
Secure from the world and its greed and its lies,
In regions you dream you are first to surprise,
Behold the plain traces of failures and sins,
The bottles and bluchers and garments and tins!
“We’ll make for the peak that show’s faint through
the haze,”
Said my comrade to me in the wandering days.
“This country is new and a sight to behold;
And, somehow', I’m certain we’re heading for gold.”
We fondly believed we were first in the race
And no man who followed our speed could outpace.
We marched with a will over boulders and stones,
But all we discovered were bottles and bones.
We stumbled on painfully, barking our shins,
Dismayed at the litter of rubbish and tins.
We pressed further on for a ridge far and dim
With eyes on horizons flushed white at the rim ;
By bull-oak and Bramble we eagerly sped
To waken the silence primeval ahead.
We left the last outpost long miles in our rear,
Assuring each other that fortune was near;
And then we beheld, when the last mile was won,
A pair of old boots curled and burnt in the sun!
And sadly, that evening, we sighed for our sins
And camped in a graveyard of bottles and tins.
We roam the wide continent, year after year;
That our quest is a vain one is painfully clear.
At times, while we squat on a stone or a log,
We see the remains of a case of tinned dog
That some hardy prospector emptied the while
He strove to uncover a new Golden Mile.
Asparagus, salmon, fresh herrings, sardines,
Sheep’s tongues and spaghetti and haricot beans
Are eaten by tourists in places remote,
Abandoned, it seems, to the wandering goat
Which eats off the labels; and. how the sun grins
And squanders his glee on the bottles and tins!

Into one’s frame are shot.

Sister, ■ you’re speaking
Of what (unless you mock)
In many a vintner’s stock
Long I’ve been seeking.
A tot, to get my vote,
Would burn and blister
The ordinary throat.
Your artless words denote
You’ve found it, sister.
Tell me where I may go '

Assuredly of dough
For such as I to know)
To drink my shockfui.

CLIMAX SMOKELESS
BLACK SHELLS
f lOADED W/r// DUPONT POWDER %
ABETTER all-purpose shell than US Climax never slid into a gun-
barrel. Close shooting, hard hitting, it remains the favorite of a host
of trap and field shots. It gets a lightning-like speed and force from its
powerful, instantaneous primer. And it is waterproof. You’ll never lose
your game through a wet or swollen cartridge if you use Climax Blackshells.
TWO TESTS WORTH MAKING.
1. To prove shell shot speed.
Empty a Climax Black Shell of its load and with the primer only shoot a
shilling into the air. Then make the same test with the primer of any other
shell of corresponding grade. You'll quickly realise why Black Shell users
need less “lead’ on the bird.
2. To prove waterproofing.
Put a Climax Black Shell into a glass of water for half an hour. Get it wetter
than you’d ever get your shells. You’ll find it still chambers and ejects as
well as if never wet.
It is Waterproof.
If the Rifle is Your Weapon —Treat it Right
US CARTRIDGES
Use
Practically Non-Fouling and Non-Erosive.
Rust and erosion are the two bitter foes of a rifle. They are persistently seeking to destroy its
accuracy by eating away the sharp edges of the rifling. With ordinary ammunition 5000 shots
may mean a rifle’s lifetime of accuracy.
But with U S Cartridges you can use your rifle without the feeling that each shot brings it nearer
its end. U S Rifle Cartridges are practically non-fouling and non-erosive.
Be good to your rifle; use U S Cartridges—the choice of crack marksmen*

AWOMAN'S
LETTER
SAY-

GLOVES
Three thousand permanent smiles deco-
rated the Town Hall the other afternoon when
the kindhearted Godhard couple gave the
biggest Christmas party on Sydney record.
Their guests were from the streets that
Santa Claus is always complaining aren’t
wide enough for the passage of his rein-
deer. From streets that have forgotten
to be streets and have becomes lanes the
kiddies flocked, and every here and there
groups of them were picked up for the jour-
ney by golden chariots that masqueraded to
grown-up eyes as special trams. The disem-
barking held up the George-street flow, but
the traffic policeman didn’t mind, for it’s not
often he feels himself surrounded by a sea
of happiness. Every child who went to the
party got a toy; and nearly 100 of them were
lucky winners of special prizes like rocking-
horses and woolly St. Bernard dogs and
tricycles and beautiful dolls. There were
films, and songs by good-natured theatricals,
and ice-creams by the million, and mountains
of cakes and sweets —enough to keep the
castor-oil bottle busy in many a home.
Mayoress Cecilia Walsh acted as hostess, and
Mr. and Mrs. Godhard worked untiringly in
the entertainment of the children. A gor-
geous party, the only unhappy thing about
it being the hundreds of kiddies who, having
heard of the doings too late to get a card,
came along on the off-chance. Stern door-
guardians let these uninvited ones slip
through until reluctantly but firmly the doors
closed on a bulging Town Hall.
Thirteen hundred youngsters were whirled
into happiness when a flight of yellow cabs
as long as from here to to-morrow dropped
them at the Ambassadors. The party was run
by a limited company of joymakers that in-
cluded Stewart Dawson, Surgeon Maitland’s
widow and Mrs. J. A. Wilson, and its guests
were. kiddies whose dads aren’t too success-
ful in growing Christmas-trees. The big
ballroom yawned sleepily at 8 o’clock when
its toilet was got under weigh for the 10
o’clock invasion. And sharp to the minute
battalions of excited youngsters swept down
the stairs, the foremost being two early-
comers who had arrived about 7.30. There
were balloons and happy, indigestible,
highly-colored sweetstuffs. There was a stock-
ing as big as a house, and a sympathetic
Father Christmas, and there were toys for
everybody. The atmosphere was heady with
excitement. Ice-creams disappeared even
as dew upon the desert’s dusty face, and a
little girl whose pathetic babv crutches
leaned against her chair turned a cheek like a
pink rose on the passing show. Mrs. Stewart
Dawson, ex-Premier George Fuller and his
lady, the Godhard couple, photographers,
policemen and a round dozen or more of other
males moved around getting a ration of joy
from the kiddies’ pleasure. Maybe the phi-
losopher among them brooded over the dif-
ference in these 10 o’ the morning revellers
and the midnight seeker after distraction.
Australia will be there. When one of the
special trams on its way to the Godhards’
party the other afternoon stopped at a
picking-up place for a load of nippers, the
driver discerned a small boy tearing up the
side street. The kiddie, about five years old,
was frantically signalling the driver to wait,
and the object he waved was a pair of
pants. Ilis own pants they were, too. As
the sprinter flashed full on the gaze it was
seen that his small sunburned hams were in
a state of nature save for a little frill of
shirt. The driver waited and, as the in-
domitable boarded the tram and set about
completing his toilet, the guard and the
driver —both ex-Diggers—gave him a cheer.
In spite of the blistering westerly on top
of Friday’s earthquake, Randwick was the
garden chosen by countless Eves to loiter in
on Saturday. The occasion was the first of
the A.J.C.’s Christmas parties, and woman,
in her widest hat and her thinnest dress, her
eye filled with indomitable courage, faced the
weather, grasping her flattest bag. The
stands bloomed noisily with the vivid coloring
and the outsize designs, cubist and horticul-
tural, which are the moment's wear. Mrs.
Pitt Rivers struck a contralto note among
the cicada-like dress choir with her milk
chocolate and gold raiment. A water-lily
trimmed hat brought a cool vibration with
her approach. One who walked in conscious
righteousness was Mrs. Harry Dransfield in
her just-tliis-minute-left-Paris outfit of black
with lilac and lettuce-green prinkings. A black
crinoline hat trimmed wflth feathers, in the
greeny blue of the peacock, was a happy last-
word. The Knox lady rustled in sumptuous
black, and Surgeon MacCormick’s lady
brought daughters Mrs. John Martin, in
ethereal pinks, and Morna, in soft white with
a turquoise hat. Philippa Stephen was an-
other who made an indelible impression in
washing attire. Dark-haired Mrs. Oscar
Ireland braved the heat-waves in mustard
attire. Barbara Bowker was a blonde bound
in blue; and Mrs. John McKelvey got a
water-melon effect from white and pinks.
The really imposing figure on the Jervis
Bay the other night was the chief steward.
Olympian as a butler of the old school, he
stood moodily surveying the rather drab
length of the one-class saloon. What layman
could plumb the thoughts of vanished great-
ness behind that portentous brow, as, arms
folded, he stood majestic as Napoleon on the
rock! At the old Orient wharf the Jervis
Bay, which had been lent by the Common-
wealth Line, was chained, and up her sides
stormed hordes of those all-tlie-year-round
dancers who make charity affairs even in
Christmas week pleasure as well as a profit.
Prince Alfred’s, that enormous and insatiable
colony of healing, w r as the beneficiary; and
the crowded decks were as a censer swung
to the glory of Mrs. Hubert Binney and Mrs.
Frank Buxton, the organisers. A group of
the V.A.’s from the Hospital Cafe in King-
street presented lucky fans at the heads of
all comers, and did it with a money-or-your-
life smile that snapped all powers of resist-
ance. Of the buccaneers Miss Hearn was
one of the mightiest. Mrs. Binney kilted up
her georgette skirts for quick action with
sprays of gay flowers, and her fellow con-
spirator, Mrs. Buxton, wore innocent-looking
lilac brocades. The raiment of secretary
Dally Thompson was roseate, and sparkled
with crystal embellishments.
Whenever tins Letter hears the word
Armenian it has a vision of distracted gentle-
men in sheepskin caps, accompanied by dis-
tracted wives, leaping among craggy fast-
nesses, while the Turk pursues tl».;m with
hungry sword. The Armenian, according to
history, has no home-life. But history seems
to have slipped somewhere, otherwise how do
you account for the national embroideries?
No lady with an eye constantly over her
shoulder could ply her thread in the beauti-
ful and unusual designs on view last week
at the Feminist Club. Mrs. Bavin declared
the little show open, and explained again
the object of the sale, which is the upkeep
of the Australian section of the Armenian
Relief Fund. Mrs. Glanville and Mrs. Kemp,
the great pillars of the work in Sydney, made
a telling appeal; Red Cross Mrs. Mackinnon
addded the word that cheers but not in-
ebriates ; and the vivid Michailovska demon-
strated how the Armenians dance on their
village greens.

Within a stone’s throw of one another the
Koyal Welfare Society and the committee of
Karitane, the Truby King Motliercraft So-
ciety’s stronghold at Coogee, held their meet-
ings one afternoon last week. The finances
of Karitane are not equal to the service it is
called upon to render, and whether the home
should be closed or not was the question of
the moment. The final decision was to carry
on and engage an organising secretary to
map out a treasury-filling campaign. Mrs.
Ken Austin still remains the home’s secre-
tary for love. The Welfare Society’s gather-
ing was one of congratulation. The secre-
tary pointed out that Maoriland under the
Truby King system had a 12 years’ start of
N. S. Wales, and when the Tresillian way
had been working 18 years he hoped the
work of the Welfare Society would be able
to compare favorably with Truby King’s.
Meantime all the old office-bearers were re-
elected, Innes-Noad again taking his place
as president.
To Mrs. Monty Severn and Mrs. Frank
Bennett must be chalked up the credit of a
movie and songandanee success at Double
Bay the other night. Its purpose was to
cheer up the treasury of the District Nurs-
ing Association, and Woollahra turned up in
its best evening-cloak and shawl. Gentle-
men posed in the vestibule with telescoping
opera-hats, and the Mayoress of Woollahra
looked in to wish the affair success. Ella
Shields came as lovable Burlington Bertie;
and Mrs. George Earp’s gorgeous kim was
the high-light of her presentation of “Butter-
fly.” Mrs. Leslie Walford warbled of
Havana, and the Coombe sisters, Moira
Brady and Donne Waldron raised their
voices in the refrain. Peggy Bell and
Devitt were others who made the night
glad and received of the bouquets that fell
to the performers—bouquets that varied in
size from the garden-plot with herbaceous
borders to one of the circumference of the
daisy in the field.
Tal Ordell, who wishes you a Merry
Christmas from this picture, has.chalked up
still another
achievement to
his long credit
account. He
has not only
written a play
(we all do
that, Heaven
help us !), but
has persuaded
an Australian
en t repreneur
to produce it.
The play,
“ Ivang aroo
F 1 a t,” is as
Australian
as the kooka-
burra, and the
man who is
giving it to
the public is
E. J. Cari'oll,
a pretty good
Au s tralian,
too. Brisbane is now cheering the show
nightly, and it looks as though the Carroll
luck plus its own merit will make this as
great a success as “The Sentimental Bloke.”
Talking of that classic is a reminder that
Tal was the irresistible Ginger Mick of the
production; he has acted on the legitimate
stage (the talkies, as Hollywood calls it)
and in the movies. He can paint, and his
stories and his verse are known to Bulletin
readers.
• The Apollos, who despite their handsome
name look from the back of the Con. rather
iike rows of penguins, burst with obvious de-
light into their final concert of the year,
though the air lay like a hot compress on
the city. Beethoven’s “Creation’s Hymn”
was the opening number, and its sublimity
lost nothing in the rendering. German’s
“Sleeping” and “London Town” and Alfred
Hill’s “Warriors’ Chorus” (the verse by
Arthur Adams) were other numbers on the
well-shaded programme that evoked the loud
hand. Cyril Monk was the night’s solo violinist
ana Jessie Bartlett and Charles Stephen its solo
song-singers. But the concert was merely the
prelude to a pretty compliment to Alfred
Hill, the choir’s conductor since 1898. Alfred
goes abroad next year, so the Society’s sub-
scribers and the choir joined forces, and the
result was a cheque handed over by the
president, knight Alfred Meeks. Then audi-
ence and Apollos joined robustly in the usual
unmusical honors.
The first performance in the ballroom
theatre of Burdekin House was appropriate
to the season. Its theme concerns that night
in Bethlehem long ago when shepherds and
kings were guided by a great star to a
lowly manger. The play has been adapted
from the pageant of the Shearmen and
Tailors in the Coventry Cycles, and John
Trevor and Don Finley, with Ken Webb,
reproduced faithfully the atmosphere of the
Middle-Age Guild performance. On the
stage were three, alcoves. One curtained in
skyey blues bestrewn with stars was Heaven,
and here Isaiah prophesied and the angel
appeared to the wise men. The middle alcove
was alternately Joseph’s house and the
manger. The third, in the hard crimson of
pride, was Herod’s throne. The opening
night of the play drew Sydney’s writers
and amateur actors in great numbers, and
a front-seater was poetess Mary Gilmore
with a sun-browned son from the north
country. Carrie Tennant (another Playbox
discovery) played the part of Mary with the
right note of simplicity, and from an alto-
gether delightful company must be singled
out Herod and the two little pages in atten-
dance on the kings. A group of girls cowled
in grey sang with fervency the Walloon
carols translated by Mrs. William Moore.
One of the North Side’s pretty blondes,
Cynthia Blair, rustled into matrimony by
way of St. Philip’s midway through last
week. Cynthia, who is the only blossom of
the A. E. Blairs of Neutral Bay, had picked
up out of the many hankies dropped before
her one with a name as trossachy as her
own stamped upon it. So Herbert Mac-
quarie Douglass, of Darling Point, was the
young man who waited at the altar, under
the eye of Canon Bellingham, and in view
of row after row of guest-filled pews. Pink
and blue hydrangeas, frilled with pale-pink
tulle, adorned each pew as father led the
bride dowh the colorful aisle in her wedding
garment of shimmering satin crepe —a mod-
ernised version of the Princess robe —with
splashes of embroidery in pearls and dia-
mente. A silver filigree design was em-
broidered on the train, which was a souffle
of ruched georgette, silver and Iloniton lace.
A tulle veil, four yards wide and nine long,
floated like a fairy foam about the slender
figure, and was arranged about the head in
the mediaeval fashion known as Joan of Arc.
Evelyn Johnstone, who was known for
several seasons to Wentworth revellers as a
clever exhibition dancer, has just become the
wife of Dr. C. J. Wiley, of Centennial Park,
by grace of the Dean of Sydney. St. Andrew’s
lit all its candles for the event, and the bride ;
was lace from her veil to the hem of her
dress. Sister Lillie ’maided and P. E. .Jones
was best man. The bride comes from Eng-
land by way of Maoriland, and the ’groom’s
father was Frederick Wiley of Capetown.
The Wentworth staged the party.
Among the persistent wanderers who have
lately returned are those two sun-worship-
pers, Mrs. Mcßobert and daughter Helen,
who when they are not seeking warmth m
the south of France (with a flight to the
married daughters in England for summer),
find all they want of it in their native Syd-
ney. They are temporarily housed at Clifton
Gardens.
There’s to be a wedding of the Arts m
Adelaide before the end of the month, and
Basil Burdett, of the Macquarie Galleries,
is hasting south to play principal male lead.
The girl of his heart is Edith Napier Birks,
whose school of fine arts has been eulogised
by Blamire Young. She is a daughter of
the Napier Birks who is the magnate of
Motors, Limited, and other firms in Adelaide.
The Greuze-like “Bunty,” daughter of
Denis Senior, of Gosford, once of Penrose,
numbers an engagement-ring among her
Christmas acquisitions. The giver thereof is
John Tanner, of Bowral. Romance started
while “Bunty” was under the wing of aunt
Mrs. F. Moates at Hampstead Flats in
Sydney.
Brisbane has a last word: —
Dainty Vera T.ucas has accepted the usual token
from John Armstrong, of Takilberan, Gin Gin. She
is the elder daughter of the F. S. Lucases of Wilston.
Gay colors predominated at Ascot for the second
summer meeting of the Q.T.C. A background of
green lawns and multicolored zinnias made a pretty
setting for Mrs. Tyrwhitt’s black and white foulard,
Mrs. Cecil Palmer’s mauve voile and Mrs. Isaac
Moore’s apricot; Mrs. Whittingham was in ivory
with a mauve design and a pink hat. Bebe Bulcock
wore floral-sprigged ninon. Olga Bruche was in red,
Sheila McCowan in henna and black. On the same
afternoon the Nathan Cup was struggled for by the
white wings of the river, the race being conducted
by the R.Q.Y.O. with the Koopa as flagship.
Keith, son of the Dynevor Downs Peglers, took
Esther Jessie, daughter of the C. B. Monteiths, of
West End, Brisbane, for better and worse in All
Saints’ Church, amid a profusion of white flowers,
Canon Garland helping him. The bride, given away
by her father, was in maize mariette, with a wide-
brimmed delphinium-blue hat. Lyla Pegler ’maided
in blue, with a black hat. Roses and greenery-
backgrounded the feasting at the bride’s home,
Hillson.
The Cliarleville Bush brotherhood have brought
60 children, mostly boys, for in most cases their
first sight of the sea. Some of the kiddies had never
been in a railway train before. They are now at
Rainbow Bay, on a grassy slope near the sea, and
in charge of Brothers Morris and Hall, Simpson (of
the Ambulance) and two hospital nurses ; and P. B.
Miles organises the camp.
St. Mary’s, South Brisbane, saw the tying of
Leo O’Sullivan and Ivy McDonald. The bride wore
silver lace, the junketing was at her mother’s home
and Pialba sees the honeymoon.
A Christmas party for the sick Diggers at Ardoyne
was arranged by the Sherwood W.C.T.U. and the
R.S.S.I.L.A. A concert followed the taking of gifts
from the tree. Sister Coves gave supper to the
visitors.
For Maiorie Hibbard, who is soon to be married,
yellow blossoms decked the Eastern tearooms at
Southport, when Miss Adamson, in cream crepe de
Chine, gave a party. The bride-elect was in lavender.
Christopher Hurworth was head-teacher at the
Brisbane Valley school when his son Edward went
in ’74 as pupil teacher to Nundah, then known as
German station. Under the late J. S. Kerr
Edward taught at the Normal, and later went on
to Stanthorpe. Ultimately he was in charge at
Kangaroo Point school, where he was chosen to edit
the Queensland school paper and the Education Onjee
Gazette. A brief illness took him from us last week.
Dora Warby and her company from Cremorne
helped Mrs. Eve to entertain the 70 patients at
Eosemount Military Hospital. Afternoon tea was
followed by a concert, at which Byrne, one of the
“long sentence” patients, said, on behalf of his
cobbers, that they could never forget the many
pleasures Mrs. Eve bad arranged for them all.
Mrs. George Marehant, on the eve of her departure
to the Cold Country, was stricken with an illness
from which she did not recover. She worked strenu-
ously for charities here, and had been five years in
charge of the Paddington branch of the Creche and
Kindergarten. She was the originator of the Christ-
mas gifts for kiddies in the Children’s Hospital.

This is a book for Owners, Trainer and Jockeys of AUSTRALIAN HORSES.
It deals exhaustively with every phase of the training of a racehorse from the

bred sires and prospective sires now in Australia, together w T ith full pedigrees.
Muggridge’s HOW TO TRAIN A RACEHORSE is undoubtedly the finest text-
book on the subject and should be invaluable to every owner and person interested

Moonee Valley, with its green trees, trim
lawns and hedges of roses fanned by a coot
breeze, provided a pleasant setting on Satur-
day for a race meeting at which Society—
busy packing or departed for hills or seaside
—was but sparsely represented. The Moonee
Valley Club entertained representatives of
the V.R.C., V.A.T.C. and Williamstown Club
and their womenfolk at luncheon. Secretary
Kewney of the V.R.C. was there with Mrs.
Kewney, and the W. Poultney Mein pair
represented the Williamstown Club. Other
sports were Rogers Thomson and his wife,
Mrs. Ben Chaffey, Russell Clarke and
Mrs. Clarke and Mrs. Wheatley, lately
arrived from Europe with the General. June
Elvidge did the lawn with Miss Effie Ball.
Moonee Valley’s secretary A. V. Hiskens and
Mrs. Hiskens received the welcoming hand
after a trip to Colombo.
Renee Kelly, in “Polly with a Past,” wears
some ultra-fashionable fal-lals in the form of
jewelled garters, an anklet of gold, shoes to
match her frocks, and huge bunches and
trails of blossoms suspended on the left from
the waist-line of gay gowns. As merely
Polly the maid she wears the trim grey
uniform of service. Her past with its
French accent, pearls and a Pekinese is
acquired firstly in georgette covering, very
short, of cosmos-pink, with trails of bowers,
and an upturned mauve hat with strings
dangling more blooms over the right ear.
Old friend Beatrice Day appears in Madonna
blue hat and frock with a crimson rose
perched on the brim of the one and ecru
lace adorning the georgette front of the
other. The sweetest of wistaria-colored rai-
ment with accordeon-pleated flounces is aired
by Margaret Darner, and an apple-green
frock with bands of white waved in black,
topped by a white hat banded with black
velvet, is worn by Dorothy Fane. Knight
George Tallis, numerous Taits, the Hen-
nessy dame and her two daughters,' Mrs. C.
Wenman, Mrs. Colin Fraser, Beryl Ainslie
and Mrs. Allen Tye were among the first
viewers whose faces and frocks caught the
eye.
Alice Richardson, the Austral Salon’s
secretary, was responsible for an attempt
to give Christmas its traditional wintry
flavor by organising a yuletide party at the
salon. Holly and mistletoe were every-
where, and many came in fancy-dress. Sir
Roger de Coverley footed a dance-pro-
grammp catholic enough to embrace also
the waltz and jazz. “Love’s Old, Sweet
Song,” sung by the hostess, who wore an
early-Victorian flounced frock of pink muslin,
was the bright flash of the evening, the
guests joining soulfully in the chorus. Mem-
bers of the Repertory Theatre. Society pre-
sented Laurence Housman’s humorously
weird “Possession —a Peep into Paradise,”
with Betty Rae as producer. Pianist Paris
du Chaumente played some dainty frag-
ments and helped to pass around ices and
coffee-cups. Myrtle Davis, costumed as
Juliet, trilled the Jewel Song, and Alba
Zacutti recited. Memories of the Robert
Brough company were revived by Mrs.
Mahrice Dudley attired as Rosamund in
“Sowing the Wind.” Miss Annette Lynch
as “Lavender and Old Lace,” aired her
mothjer’s wedding-cape of the loveliest Duch-
esse ‘Point over mauve brocade. A coat of
fine yak lace, also her property, was dis-
played by Mrs. Galwey in a Dickens charac-
ter. Netta Woodbine made a charming
Watteau shepherdess, and Mrs. W. Wade
trailed the sable raiment of Marv Queen
of Scots.
The pretty, if somewhat thin, Ernest
Denny comedy, “All-of-a-Sudden Peggy,” in-
troduced at the Palace mainly for the good
of the City Newsboys’ Society, brought out
Gaston Mervale as producer, with amateurs
as the players. In the name role Ceridwer
Kelly culled the laurels of the show. Sin
is a dainty young person with a nice bronze-
gold shingle, which kind of melted in effec-
tively with a reseda green crepe-de-Chine
frock. Frank Louie helped along the
maiden’s sudden outbreaks. Mrs. Louis Nel-
ken, very successful in the part of Lady
Crackenthorpe, featured fringe largely in her
dressing. Maisie Bennett was ever so attrac-
tive a Widow O’Mara, which atoned in some
measure for an accent that was yet another
injustice to Ireland. Pauline Abrahams, all
pale blue, appeared as a titled aristocrat is
supposed to appear according to the canons
of the stage; and Gaston Mervale, Millicent
Ryan, Claude Thomas and others helped to
pass a cheerful couple of hours. Walter
lvirby and Robert Molyneux sang between
acts. Mrs. T. Mclnerney—with pink roses
on black picture millinery allied to an ivory
georgette frock—and Mrs. Nelken secretaried
the entertainment.
Gifts aplenty were received at the Austral
£alon by Mrs. Jim Angus for the “White
Elephant auction in aid of the Alfred Hos-
pital. Parcels of all sorts of intriguing
shapes were piled up, interest centring in
a vast and mysterious hat-box which was
found to be crammed with Christmas cakes.
Salon-secretary Alice Richardson gave a
table-centre beuring the cachet of first honors
at the Royal Agricultural Show. Mrs. Kroef
Gwen Dwyer, Mrs. Ed. Dyson, Airs. George
Haines and Kathleen Rochfort cheered the
gathering with song, and Violet Carruthers
drew sweet music from her violin while tea-
cups clinked. D. G. Macdougall, the restless
secretary of the Alfred, came along to say
thanks.
Tasmania, which in proportion to popula-
tion, gathered in more war decorations than
h er sisters, is the first to erect a
► tate memorial, not only to those who never
came back, but also to every man and woman
who enlisted for active service. The unveil-
ing was performed by Governor O’Grady in
clw 'R°. m 1 ain : w h ence I'ises a granite obelisk
NOft. high, from whose summit a fiery cross
may by night be seen from all parts of the
city. Rut Tasmania has its mean ones, too;
before 10 o clock the same evening the rib-
bons had been stolen from the wreath which
the Mayoress had laid at the base of the
obelisk.
At the Auditorium recently the Victorian
l ostal Institute choir, encouraged by its
grand championship at Ballarat last year,
tackled the unaccompanied Bach motet,
Jesu, Priceless Treasure” as the chief fea-
ture or an ambitious programme, emerging
trom tie choral fray a little shaken but
generally quite victorious. The massive
harmonies and intricate fugal patterns of
the great master of polyphony search out
the weak spots in any choir, but the Postal
choristers found their way successfully
through the labyrinth and ended really
brilliantly.
Sport nowadays bulks as large in the
curriculum of girls’ schools as the rule of
three, calisthenics and use of the globes
did in the Victorian era. At St. Catherine’s
break-up, held at Prahran Town Hall, the
array ot silver cups and oak shields for game
champions would have put the trophies of
the average boys’ college in the shade. Miss
lempleton, in cinnamon crepe de Chine and
lace, read the annual reckoning; and Arch-
bishop Harrington Lees handed the study
prizes to the demure intellectuals of the
seminary, Mrs. Lees doing her bit in passing
out the silver- and oak-ware to the “sports,”
who got most of the applause. The maiden
who received dressmaking honors created
very little furore, while the winner of a
divinity prize had to rely almost wholly
upon the church for her ovation. Lesley
Bailey, the school’s captain, who recently
won a golf championship, collected a barrow-
load of the e.p.-ware, Merle Taylor gather-
ing up much of what was left and sharing
the glory of tennis doubles with Pixie TabarL
a daughter of the V.A.T.C. secretary.
Linda Phillips (Mrs. Maurice Kauff-
mann) is one of Melbourne’s makers of
melody in song and lyric. Under Fritz Hart
at the Albert-street Con. she developed her
Hair for composition, and several of her un-
accompanied choral works, including her re-
cent “Lake
Isle of Innis-
free,” a set-
ting of Yeats's
verses, ha v e
been sung by
the ladi e s’
choir of the
Mel b a Con.
Evelyn Seot-
uey popular-
ised her song,
"T h e Swal-
lows,” which
i s no w in-
cluded in the
star soprano’s
repertoire
abroad. A book
of Mrs. Ivauff-
mann’s verse,
"Prom a City
Garden,” has
lately been
published by Eudieott.
Members of the Women's Automobile Club
exchanged season’s greetings at Champion
House over the warm but cooling beverage
at their last social gathering of the year.
Music and a guessing competition whiled
away a couple of hours. The competition
called for a cyclopaedic knowledge of the dif-
ferent makes of motors, and was found diffi-
cult even by members whose prowess with
clutch and gears is admired by all. The
president, Mrs. 11. J. Robertson, received
some lovely floral trifles, a wicker basket of
pink water-lilies eliciting many gasps.
Jennie Brenan lent the Embassy for a
hop with cards organised by St. Vincent’s
Nurses’ Association to help the Tallis appeal,
which already has brought in over a tnou-
sand pounds. An energetic committee fol-
lowed the leadership of Mrs. F. Blackall,
president, Mrs. W. R. Burston, secretary,
and Miss A. Cavan agh, treasurer.
A choral service at Trinity Church graced
the wedding of Audrey Fleming and Lieuten-
ant Rosenthal, R.A.N., second son of the
Major-General of the Sydneyside. The bride,
a daughter of the F. ,1. Flemings of St.
Kilda, carried a sheaf of Christmas lilies
against a gown of ivory lace and georgette,
with tulle train and veil. Her three maids,
Kathleen Cusack. Enid King and Susie Tol-
hurst, were studies in sweet-pea mauve ex-
pressed in georgette and lace, crinoline straw
and posies. Lieutenant Geoffrey Hall was
best man. Congratulations were tendered at
No. 9 Darling-street. The hostess relieved
an all-black toilette with silver embroidery;
and the groom’s mother, who wore a black-
beaded gown and crinoline hat, brightened
the effect with a fuchsia-hued posy.
Miss Lulu Montgomery,, much interested
in societies that look after the welfare of
dumb beasts, recently became Mrs. Charles
Lort Smith, her lesser half being a member
of a well-known Melbourne law-firm. Only
relatives and a few very old friends were
invited.
Beresford Fowler has introduced to Mel-
bourne audiences some very promising ama-
teurs, and a Dickinson-Monteath camera
here pictures in Dulcie Bland one of the
most successful of his leading ladies—she has
been seen in
Ibsen and
Bernard Shaw
plays. Tliongl.
she handed
herself and
her nice
shingle over to
Allen Meakin,
only son of the
Russell Meak-
ins of Geelong,
on December
22, she does
not promise to
give up her
i n t e rest in
stage matters.
The other day
her pupils met
around the tea-
cups at the
liivoli to wish
her much luck
with her change of name, and handed her a
cheque for a wedding gift.
A wedding party stole into All Saints’
Church, St. Kilda, a few days ago, and when
it came out Netta Searll was the wife of Dr.
Gordon Hislop, medical superintendent of
the Children’s Hospital at Perth. Netta is
the youngest daughter of Mrs. A. T. Searll,
of St. Kilda. The rejoicings were quite
private.
Marion Bridges, younger daughter of the
late Major-General, has arrived back from a
holiday in Asia; and at a tea-party given her
by Mrs. Russell Clarke the news was broad-
casted that she has promised to return to
Penang in January and exchange “I wills”
with Arthur Maxwell, whose parents, the
Crawford Maxwells, live in Tasmania. The
bride-elect is off to spend Christmas with
her prospective in-laws.
The Friends’ school in Hobart—the only
school of its kind in the Commonwealth—-
had a Christmas break-up with tears very
close to the customary smiles. It was losing
its beloved Margaret Irvine after 38 years’
service; and scholars, past and present, had
built up a cheque for £3OO to give her.
Colonel Elliott, who is among the school’s
old boys, handed it over amid mingled regrets
and rejoicings.
The University Conservatorium’s second
pupils’.concert at the Melba Hall was res-
cued from entire femininity by one lone
youth. Its other notable features were a
Handel aria sung by Hetty Thompson, whose
contralto notes were found agreeable, and
the playing of the first movement of I)e
Beriot’s Concerto in G by Ilermia Barton,
a flapper-violinist with the two-plait coiffure
and some genuine ability.
In Sydney the end of December brings
Christmas bush and bells; in Melbourne
the ’perfume of lavender is scattered every-
where. You scent it long before you sec
the (lower stalls—masses of mauve blooms
from which bunches may be culled for “a
traybit, lady.” Even the petrol-pushed
traffic cannot kill the clean fragrance.
To show appreciation of the work of their
secretary, Miss F. Johnson, for 17 years an
indefatigable battler, on their behalf, mem-
bers of the Women Teachers’ Association of
Victoria rallied round at Anzac House and
gave her a cheque for 60 guineas. President
Miss A. Fleming handed over the Christmas
gift and expressed the association’s gratitude.
The attention of a big audience at the Prin-
cess the other night was divided between
“Archie,”, which has developed into a bright
breezy show, and a front stallite who had a
swathed coiffure. It was unique, its like
never having been seen outside an Egyptian
bazaar. There must have been yards of' the
deep ivory silk: it covered the wearer’s ears,
disclosing only circlet pearl ear-rings and a
tiny lock of hair.
Beatrice Holloway sends greetings from
America, where she and her husband. Bob
Greig, are happily established. Bob is in the
cast of the successful musical piece, “The
Student Prince.” Mrs. Greig remarks that
“Cradle-snatchers,” a clever play by Norma
Mitchell (a cousin of Muriel Starr), has
made a hit. She also has a word to say
upon “Weak Sisters,” a play that carries
some rather broad speeches, but which has
found considerable patronage. Australian
audiences, she hazards, would not find the
play to their liking.
The old gag that the youth of no par-
ticular intelligence was relegated to the
< hurcli found its parallel the other day when
a school-girl, on being questioned by the
Head, intimated that the career she had
decided on was that of a wife. “And why?"
asked the surprised marm. “Oh, there’s
no fag of examinations to pass,” was the
comprehensive answer.
At the bidding of the Mayoress, wives of
aldermen and councillors met at the Town
Hall to drink a farewell cup of tea with Mrs.
S. J. Morell and her daughter Sheila, who
are off to Europe. The hostess wore a frock
of fawn crepe de Chine and lace, allied to
tjt-1 ac k Dorothy Humphries and Ivy
Wilmot sang to Miss N. Richardson’s accom-
paniment.
Sister Adelaide sends greetings:—
A New \ ear’s ball had been planned by the
W allace Bruces to ring in their mayoral regime, but
Court mourning cancelled that, and they turned theii
energies to a Queen Alexandra memorial fund, launched
with their own cheque for £lOO. The modest
objective was £660 for two beds at the Children’s
Hospital, but the total swiftly flew to £lOOO.
Ex-Mayoress Clover has had another good-bye party,
this time with the Helene Taylor committee as
hostesses. That, committee performed the rather
remarkable feat of raising £436 on an outlay of
£25, and attributes a good deal of it to the ex-
Mayorcss.
The engagement is announced of Alison, daughter of
the W. P. Harts of I'oltalloch, to Carton, son of the
P. S. Hones.
This year’s Catherine Helen Spence scholarship
goes to Daisy Curtis, to the joy of her fellow police-
women. The scholarship provides for research in
social legislation and reform on the other side of
the world, and because of her job and training the
knowledge Miss Curtis will bring back should be of
great benefit to the State.
Life has moved chiefly to the piping of the
young, and school break-ups, Christmas shopping
and holiday moving have not left much time
for frivolling. Victor Harbor is full to burst-
ing point (there is a pathetic story of two leases
signed for the same cottage), and even far distant
P.obe bids fair to become a “popular” watering
place now that a passable motor road can eliminate
the dreary narrow-gauge train journey. At the Oval,
where St. Peter’s registered an innings’ win in a
triumphant flutter of blue and white flags and
ribbons, Sangster and Downer were the heroes.
Downer, by the way, is a grandson of old Federalist
John. In Prince Alfred- junketings there has been
a minor note, for James Ashton has retired from the
staff after 39 years as art master. His good-bye
trinkets include one from his fellow pedagogues,
a gold watch and a wallet from the school and a
parcel from the Preparatory.
The joy-rider is admittedly a soulless brute, but
lie surpassed himself when he annexed a motor from
near by a well-known church. The owners were
prospective honeymoeners, who emerged from the
knot-tying to find their chariot vanished. It was
retrieved in the West-end market a couple of days
later.
On view at the moment is a collection of water-
colors by the sisters Hambidge—chiefly portraits
and sketches of best-known gardens and homes. The
latter include Shirley, once the Bakewell property at
Payneham, some delightful bits of Birksgate and
a view of the Haekett-Moulden home in North
Adelaide.
Two items of post-war work never neglected are
care of disabled soldiers at the Anzac Hostel and
of shell-shock cases at the Parkside mental home.
Both have had their Christmas parties this week—-
the former with a special programme for > their
amusement, to a fitting accompaniment of tea and
cuke and Christmas parcels, with Mrs. P. S.
Toms, Mrs. Michael Hawker, Mrs. Dudley Hayward
and Mrs, H. C. Downer as the hostesses. The
men at Parkside are the special care of a V.A.D.
detachment under Mrs Bigmore, and every week since
the need began there has been an afternoon’s
entertainment for them. This week they had their
Christmas party too—4o of them in the big dining-
room, and 20 more, too ill to join them, in another
room. Here, too, was all the panoply of Christmas;
but it was a tragic party to onlookers and, as far
as the men were concerned, mostly a silent one.
The strain of carrying on such devoted work week by
week only those who undertake it can know ; but
it goes on without hitch or intermission, un-
realised by the public except when some special
entertainment brings it, for a moment, to light.

“What a Great Big Mouth YouVe Got!”
You remember Little Red Riding Hood, and the
savage wolf who waited for her with his big mouth all
ready for action?
She got away in time, and the general impression is
that she lived happy ever after.
Don’t you believe it! There are too many other
devouring animals on the path of life.
If you live in another man's house , you have one of them constantly on
your doorstep , and he takes his weekly bite out of your income.
And the bites get larger and larger, for the Rent-
Wolf grows hungrier as time goes on. And you say in
the words of Little Red Riding Hood: 11 What a great big
mouth you've got!"
Every man should, therefore, see that he is not dependent on someone else for a roof over the heads
of his wife and family.
It is not easy for the average man to get a ."house of his own, but we make it as easy as possible.
Even as an investment, suburban land such as we handle is first-class. You cannot find any ot er sa e
investment with equal prospects of fin/ancial gain.
Once the land is paid for, it will be good security for the building of a
home. When you reach that stage, the problem of rising rents will trouble
you no more. In fact, the more they rise, the more valuable your house will
become.
Don't wait for the Rent-Wolf to lose his appetite , You know he won't!

A Beverage
i a
Double Purpose.
WOLFE’S SCHNAPPS differs from all
other stimulants in that it is something
more than a “drink.” It is, above all,
a beverage with a medicinal purpose. Its
diuretic effect—its corrective action on the
kidneys, assisting them to function properly
and filter from the system the impurities they
collect—is its most valuable feature.
That is why the greatest good accrues from
the moderate use of Wolfe’s. “One Wolfe’s
a Day for Your Health’s Sake” is the course
prescribed by experience and wisdom. Make
it your Golden Rule and you will become just
one more in the multitude who, through three
generations, have found Wolfe’s Schnapps a
wonderfully beneficial stimulant.
Wolfe s Schnapps is obtain-
able in three sizes—Quarter
Bottles, Half Bottles and
Large Bottles.

SPORTING
NOTIONS
Saturday was a brute of a day m Sydney,
and most of the 29,000 people at Rand wick had a
beast of a time until the fourth race. Few outside
the respective stables backed the oft-defeated Mend it
(B’s) in the Hurdle, or the smart country mare
Tiny’s Court in the first division of the Trial Handi-
cap, or even Minjerookah (12’s) in the December
Nursery, although the last-named filly is trained by
the elder Kelso, who is having a remarkable season.
But Hemisphere (7 to 2) obliged in the Villiers
Stakes and Trillo (5 to 2) in the second division of
the Trial, and there was fair public support for
Dainty Davie (B’s) in the Holiday Handicap and
Sea Risk (7’s) in the Highweiglit; in fact, with
a change in the weather came a change of luck.
Still McShortodds had the better of the argument
on the whole. At least 9 of the 18 starters were
backed for good money in the Villiers, which served
to show what a smart horse Hemisphere is. He was a
long way back in the early stages, and as they
turned into the straight was behind Valais Queen
(the pace-maker), King Cvllene, Undaunted, Quan
Tart and Valdoona, but, responding brilliantly to
R. Marsden’s urging, he rushed past them with an
irresistible run, and although the margin between
him and Quan Tart was only a neck, he could have
increased it. Meenah, who also finished well, beat
Undaunted in an interesting struggle for third
money ; of the others, Valais Queen and King Cyllene
showed pace for seven furlongs, but Pigeon Pie was
a disappointment. Owned and trained by F. J.
Marsden, Hemisphere is a four-year-old bay stallion
by imported Cyklon—Asturina, and, having shown
his ability to travel 10 furlongs, is quite likely to
develop into a stayer. He was 3 to 1 most of the
time, and those who backed him at that price
growled when they looked at the grandstand tote,
which paid £2 Is. 6d. for 10s. —it would have been
Just on 6 to 1 had there been one dividend instead
of three. Pigeon Pie was 7 to 1, Meenah B’s, Quan
Tart and King Cyllene 10’s, Royal Dighton and Sir
Alick 12’s, Balbus 14’s and Undaunted 16’s.
The track was exceptionally fast, as witness the
fact that Mendit’s two miles over obstacles were run
in 3min. 3§Jsec., Tiny Court’s six furlongs in lmin.
lllsec., Trillo’s in lmin. 12-jsec., Minjerookah’s half
mile in 591 sec,, and Hemisphere’s mile in lmin.
37Jsec. Mendit’s time -is a world's record, Min-
jerookah’s a record for the course and Hemisphere’s
a record for the race. After the Hurdle came a
southerly which helped the sprinters but hindered
the middle-distance horses; for example, it took
Dainty Davie 2min. 7isec. to gallop 10 furlongs
in the Holiday Handicap, and he finished lengths
ahead of a strung-out field after leading all the way.
Trillo, an enormous bay gelding by Three —Tehama,
showed fine speed in his particular race and will
probably win again before he returns to Melbourne,
especially if Pike rides him as artistically as he did
on Saturday. There was a ton of money for The
White Diamond in the Highweiglit, but this fine-
looking horse, who perhaps requires a bit more work,
grew tired of chasing Collaroi, dhe latter, with a
stable-bov up, nearly stole the race; first away and
first into the straight, it was only in the last few
strides that he was headed by Sea Risk. His ring
price was 20 to 1, but he returned his backers
£lO 4s. on the 10s. tote, which means that he would
have paid over 60 to 1 on a straightout machine.
Yet another argument for the installation of s.o.
totes.
Dainty Davie, who carried 7st. Sib. in the Holiday
Handicap (the minimum was 7st.), will have 6st.
131 b. in the Summer Cup on Saturday. The distance
is three furlongs further, and that may help Player
i(6st. 131 b.), Highlander (7st. 31b.), Prince Minim-
foah' (Sst.), and Bard of Avon (Bst. 41b), but these
four horses were well beaten by the Don Reynaldo—
The Knot stallion, as also were Stony (B'st. 41b.), The
Wild Goose (Bst. lib.), and Master Cagou (7st.
fib), albeit the last-named ran third—Eaton Boy,
s runner up, is not engaged. Solidify (Bst. 101 b.),
p '<Sf« C. (7st. 71b.), Royal Roue (7st. 41b.) and
ruu (6st. 121 b.) did not run in the Holiday,
Jjuadt two of them may give Dainty Davie more
and one
trouble than anything that did. This page has a
fancy for Luddenham, who stays pretty well and
is well; and Royal Roue also has a chance.
The feature of the racing at Moonee VaL
ley CVie.) was the easy manner in which buomi
won the Laluma Handicap, the principal event ot
the day. Going out second favorite at 5 to a
he was at a longer price earlier in the betting, but
the money came for him in lumps—he fook eharge
with about three furlongs to go, and romped home
by six lengths from Spearage and Warwickshire,
Noggin, first choice at 9 to 4, was a poor filth.
Suomi, who is by Finland —War Talk, was well
fancied for Purser’s Caulfield Cup, and is a B°®“
sort. With so few stayers about, he is sure to be
dangerous in whatever race is chosen for him during
the holidays. L. J. McCann, who has King of
Mirth in his care, trains him and he is owned by
Mrs. C. Russell Gabb. He carried Bst. 21b. in
the Laluma and covered the 10 furlongs in 2min.
5 a sec. One of T. M. Burke’s string in Suspension
(Burrabadeen—Tenterhook) was victorious in the
lvoombahla Maiden Plate after a great struggle with
Raddle. Duncan was at his best on the winner,
who nearly pulled off a double; saddled up again,
he ran second to Stareen in the Argyle Highweight
Handicap. Santock (Quantock —Lady Santoi) landed
the Barkoola Handicap for two-year-olds by a short
head from the unlucky Rainproof and Margaux; and
Shaheen, who is trained and part-owned by Dick
Bradfield, won the six furlongs Kiata Handicap for
apprentice riders, with Poetaster (likely to score
soon) and Papinyah in the places. McShortodds
grinned all the way back to the city, for only one
favorite —Miltrim —-was successful in six events.
* * * *
“Ascot”: Brisbane bookmakers are so used
to having it all their own way that when a rare
favorite wins they wail that the game’s no good.
On the last day of the Q.T.C. December meeting three
favorites and one equal favorite won out of 10
races, and the lamentations of the layers split the
sky. Yet the tote laid longer odds, even about the
favorites, with two extra dividends thrown in; and
then showed a profit of well over £3OOO on the day.
The hottest favorite was Taupo—evens with the
books; the flat tote paid 6J to 5, with a second
dividend. Another hot favorite was Juleigh, 2 to 1 ;
the tote paid 2.2 with two other dividends (flat
tote, 2.9) ; in other words, the tote not only laid
longer odds than the books, but would have returned
the punter’s stake had the horse run second or third.
The other favorites were Coin Nut (4 to 1) and
Mareoda (3 to 1) ; the tote prices (taking second
and third dividends into account) were 5.3 and
3.8 to 1. McShortodds laid 5 to 1 against another
winner ( Sky cloud) ; the paddock tote laid 7.3 to 1
for a place (equivalent to 12.8 to 1 5.0.) and the
flat tote 17.6 to 1 for a place (equivalent to 31.6
to 1 5.0.). And this was the worst day the bookies
have had for months!
* * * *
“Bris”; To prevent forgery, tote tickets
issued bv the Q.T.C. always bear a check word. The
man who allots the check words is a pretty good
tipster and something of a wag. A disgusted punter
showed me his ticket headed “Obituary.” What
chance has a man of collecting on that?’’ he
growled. I looked over my last day’s collection of
tickets and found them marked “Parson,” “Thump,”
“Gloom,” “Gravity,” “Woeful” and “Farcical.” All
losers of course. But I remember collecting on
a ticket marked “Vimful.” If the tote tipster would
only let us know his check words in advance it
would save cross words afterwards.
“L. Woo” : A Brisbane business man who
is fond of the gee-gees never goes to the races. He
doesn’t need to. His villa overlooks the Ascot race-
course, a leading jockey lives next door, and on the
other side is an s.p. bookmaker. The business man.
gets the dinkum oil from the jockey, makes a bet
with the bookmaker, and then goes on to his front
verandah with a pair of field-glasses and watches the
race.

Carbine to victory in the Melbourne Cup of 1890

the guest of the W.A.T.C. at its Cup meetings.
He was nearly 61 when he weighed in.

“Shrewsbury” : The death of G. W. Smith,
the British bookie who traded as George Drake, is
a reminder that Jewry does not bulk nearly so large
in the ring in Britain as it does in Australia.
Smith, like his contemporaries Peech and Pickersgill,
both recently dead, was a Yorkshireman, but he fared
poorly in comparison with them, leaving a paltry
£13i,000, as against the £750,000 which Pickersgill
reluctantly abandoned and the £550,000 found in
Peech’s bag. Laying the odds in England is not
what it was in the days of John Gully. There arc-
no punters now like the Marquis of Hastings, George
Payne, or even the Jubilee Plunger. The . little fish
may be sweet, but they take a lot of netting, while
modern turf information, at the disposal of everyone
who can buy an evening paper, is so up to date
and accurate that even a Yorkshire bookie has to
scratch gravel to keep ahead of the game.

Having a match with Harry Collins in
prospect, and knowing that Havilah Uren carries a
heavy wallop in his left glove, Westralian Eddie
Butcher was noticeably careful in his engagement
with Uren at the Sydney Stadium. He declined
serious warfare as much as he could, making great
use of the ring-space and clinching whenever the
doggedly-pursuing Penrith (N.S.W.) pug. moved
within striking distance. One result of his eagei
hugging was that he butted Havilah heavily on
the right eyebrow in the fifth round, causing a gash
that bled all the rest of the time; and the hemor-
rhage was accelerated by the W estralian s rough
treatment of the wound. For this referee Wallis
rebuked the Boulder City youth on several occasions.
Butcher got the decision at the end of 20 dreary
rounds. He weighed in 61b. heavier than Havilah,
who scaled 9st. 101 b.

“Past Grammar”: Many a Queenslander
in exile will rejoice to hear that Brisbane citizens are
getting up a petition to the Greater Brisbane Council
to spare the old Rugby Union ground at Bowen
Bridge Always rather a primitive arena, it was
the scene of many a stirring battle between N.
Wales and Queensland in those golden days of Rugby
when cash considera-
tions did not corrupt
nor golf and tennis
break through and steal
the cream of the ris-
ing generation. Per-
haps its “peak load’*
was the first Maoriland-
Queensland match in
1897. Half the vast
crowd (for Brisbane)
could not see the game,
so lightly turned to
thoughts of beer, which
it translated into
action. Having got the
band well sozzled,
various amateurs ap-
propriated the instru-
ments, and at half-
time, when Queensland
was leading, the players
were met on the field
and escorted off by
their delighted com-
patriots, who danced
before them with trum-
pets and shawms, not
to mention the big
drum.

Provided expenses are forthcom-
ing, Major Goodsell will risk his world’s sculling
championship in a match w’ith Bert Barry on
the Putney-Mortlake stretch of the Thames. The
title has been carried oversea before. Ned Trickett
lost it to Edward Hanlan (Canada) on the Thames in
1880, and Dick Arnst left it with Barry in 1912.
But Bill Beach kept it against Jake Gaudaur in 1886,
and Harry Searle against W. O’Connor in 1889,
although it reverted to O’Connor on Searle's untimely
death; and Jim Stanburv brought it back after his
meeting with C. R. Harding in 1896. Tom Saul,
of Macleay River (N.S.W.), has challenged Goodsell,
but the latter has his mind on a sea voyage.

“Adelaide”: Club cricket in Adelaide ad-
journed for the more serious inter-State fixtures,
with the Sturt district standing clean out from tne
others. This is Vic Richardson’s club, and the
recent addition of Scott’s fast bowling has given it
the extra nip in attack that it needed. In the
team also is Bartlett, a young batsman who has
been strangely overlooked by the S.A. selectors.
But much of the current success is due to the
veterans Willsmore, Gould and Townsend. The last-
named in particular is bowling nearly as well, and
hitting quite as fiercely, as when he was one of
the first choices for the S.A. XI.
* * * *
South Aus., starting with high hopes and
a correct coin-call against N.S.W. on Friday, had
arrived in a desperate position on Saturday. In-
different batting began the trouble and missed
chances intensified it. The total reached only 185 ;
excepting Vic Richardson, the captain, who compiled
59 by free and confident cricket, Rymill (26), Run-
dell ‘(37 not out) and Scott (20), none of the
southerners made any show against Mailey (G for
79) and Everett (2 for 35) ; Gregory and Macartney
took a wicket apiece. After this, various of the Ma
State's batsman proceeded to improve their chances
of catching the eve of the selectors of the team for
England. Collins failed for once, but Macartney
signalised his return to first-class form by knocking
up 112 with qll his old grace and forcefulness,
Bardslev contributed 47, Taylor 95 (made in
under two hours), Andrews 63, Kelleway 50 and
Kippax 56. The innings closed on Monday for 554.
Grimmett proved expensive, and wicketless on Satur-
day but he had cruel luck, for Taylor should have
been stumped off him early in his innings and
Bardslev was indebted to ’keeper Ambler for a
life. Andrews, too, would have been run out it
Whitty had possessed a little more of the springiness
that is prone to vanish with the years. Scott bowled
creditably, and Rymill’s ground fielding was, as
usual, good to see.
Passed out, in his 78th year, A. N. Hojv
one of the finest cricketers 'at whom a crowd e\
roared approval in the ’seventies and ’eighties when
he captained Lancashire. In his youth he was a
Rugby international, too. Hornby came to Australia
as a member of Lord Harris’s team in ’7B; he played
for England against the Australian sides of ’B2 and
’B4. A hard-hitting batsman who almost always
opened the innings, a brilliant cover-point and a
captain who threw all his heart into the work of
collecting the best county team available and getting
the most out of it, Hornby will live long in cricket
annals. Among his lesser distinctions he has that of
being acclaimed, along with the stonewalling pro-
fessional Barlow, in some verses by the ill-starred
poet, Francis Thompson —probably the only instance
on record of a genuine poet finding a theme on the
cricket field.

“Hambledon”: It has always puzzled me
why spectators at Australian cricket matches are
debarred from the privilege of swarming over the
ground during the lunch interval, as they always used
to do in England and apparently still do, judging
from the photographs in the illustrated papers. The
only difference, 1 think, is that the pitch is lightly
roped in nowadays so that the sagacious mob’s
numerous feet can’t do it any damage. It was
always a pleasant way of stretching one’s legs, and
it was intriguing to hear experts or those who ranked
themselves as such learnedly explaining to less gifted
persons which were the hoof-prints Of Blinks, the
demon bowler, and what was the precise quality in
the turf which had enabled Blog'gs to break back
a foot with disastrous effects to Blevin’s timber-yard.
In a more democratic country like this, it is a
wonder that pitch-surveying when the players are
off the ground isn’t demanded as a right rather than
a privilege. Is the non-exercise thereof a survival
from the days when most matches were played on
matting? I don’t suppose anybody ever wanted to
see how a matting wicket was wearing.

“Tren” : A Ma State XI seems certain to
“do” England in Australia’s interest next year.
Collins, Gregory, Taylor, Macartney, Oldfield,
Kelleway, Andrews, Mailey and Bardsley are
pretty sure to go, and Hendry and Love,
now of Vic., both learned the game in the
Ma State. On Grimmett, too, Sydney has a call,
for in that city he played his first cricket on the
mainland. Kippax or Scott may increase tjhe
N.S.W. quota; anyhow, it is pretty safe to wager that
a Mothah State side will be included in the 15.
There were 10 N. S. Welshmen in the 1921 lot, and
then Kelleway declined an invitation.
“George”: I don’t agree with “E.W.”
when he says (B. 17/12/’25) that “there Is not such
a wide margin between the N.S.W. first and second
elevens.” Also, as one who has seen both O’Connor
and Ellis in action, my vote goes to the Victorian
every time. There is no doubt, however, that
Queensland should be admitted to the Sheffield Shield
competition. W T ith limited opportunities against first-
class teams, it has produced such men as McLaren,
Hartigan, Alan Marshal, Hutcheon, Ironmonger,
Thompson, O’Connor, Hornibrook and Oxenham, and
with match play against better opponents, a further
improvement would be the result. Incidentally, the
N.S.W. cricket authorities are not to be blamed
for the Northern State's being kept outside the
charmed circle. They have always advocated its
inclusion.
* * * *
“Young ’Un”: Lionel Wall, bowling for
Paddington (N.S.W.) against Gordon, caught Camp-
bell well out of his ground in over-eager backing up
for short runs, and whipped the bails oft instead of
delivering the ball. Ignorant onlookers hooted the
bowler and reporters wrote of it as “a most unusual
incident.” It is unusual chiefly because batsmen in
general avoid the risk of being thus run out. About
52 years ago I saw H. E. Cotton, a young English-
man, playing in a match on the Albert Barracks
ground, Auckland (M.L.), perform this trick at
the expense of a sprinter who was too eager to
steal runs, and it has been done in Australia many
times since. Incidentally, Wall (4 for 59) and
Asher (4 for 30) dismissed the last six Gordon
batsmen for 14 runs on a flawless wicket, Gordon
having on the first day lost 4 for 117 in reply to
Paddington’s 171, and the latter has a good lead
for the Sydney premiership.

Adelaide’s only inter-college cricket-match
was a one-sided affair this year, Prince Alfred,
winners the last two seasons, being able to manage
only 158 and 155. Every bowler tried for St.
Peter’s took wickets, McLachlan,: son of the sporting
squatter “Paratoo” of that ilk, ‘ standing out With
6 for 63. For the Saints, total 439, a son of
Fred Downer, of S.A. Cricket Association committee,
made 130 very carefully, and Stone from Tasmania
a fiercely hit 85 not out. Adelaide Uni. sent a
strong side to Melbourne for the inter-’Varsity final
and Sydney was defeated by three 'Wickets. The
losers were without Taylor, Rock arid Nothling, but
Hogg (39 and 72), Harris (63, and 10 for 151) and
Doyle (98) battled manfully for them. Adelaide’s
best work was done by McKay (71, 82, and 6 for
156), Prest (32 and 96) and Wagner (8 for 163).
* * * *
A by-law framed by Adelaide City Council,
proposing to make all the reserves and parklands
“dry,” has caused a brisk discussion. The new
clause is the result of a suggestion by Police Com-
missioner Leane, the Mayor mentioning a case where
“a so-called cricket match” used 60 dozen bottles of
beer. The discussion wandered to the bowling-club
reserves, Lundie claiming that “more liquor is drunk
there than on the rest of the parklands put to-
gether.” Then someone remembered that Victoria
Park, the home of the highly respectable Adelaide
Racing Club, would be covered by the enactment;
and the by-law was sent back to the Works Com-
mittee, to be dealt with by the new Council.

“Hamer” : Even croquet is thrusting itself
into the championship arena. A team from Australia
made a savage attack on the croquet lawns of Eng-
land not long ago, three “Test matches” being
played. Now, Maoriland is holding a championship
which has attracted Sir Francis Colchester-Wem.v-s
all the way from England. If the representative of
the Golchester-Wemysses fails to annex a glory from
which apparently he will not be barred bv lack of
residential qualification, he will salve his disap-
pointed soul with trout fishing. Sir Francis is no
Willie-boy—he held a commission in the Cameronians
during the war and is a director of a big Gloucester
(Eng.) waggon-making business.
THE COUNTER ATTRACTION.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
“On the day of the wedding he appeared most
anxious to get away to be present at the first race.
—Sydney Divorce Court.
He married her, but had no time to linger,
His thoughts were obviously w’ith the ring
Nay, not the hoop he’d placed upon her finger;
The pencillers, bejewelled and bellowing,
Held in his mind a more insistent place:
He didn’t want to miss the hurdle race.
He signed the register when they addressed him
And snatched perhaps a perfunctory kiss;
Withal the book that really obsessed him
Was quite a different article from this.
The odds that he was striving to assess
Were not about his nuptial happiness.
His wedding breakfast speech was brief and jerky,
He scarcely ate a bite. He couldn’t force
His fancies on the beef or pork or turkey,
They strayed from legs of lamb to legs of horse.
Dead birds he had in mind, right sure I am,
But not the sort they serve with tongue or ham.
All life, he told himself, was left for mating
Endearments and accessories, but it hurt
To think by amorous procrastinating
A newly-wed might miss a Randwick cert.
No sense, he said, in taking risks like that,
And reached incontinently for his hat.

THE INKY WAY.
“A.G.M.”: Beverley Nichols, who, as secretary to
Melba, wrote her recently-published autobiography,
has decided to now print his own life-story, and has
found a publisher in Jonathan Cape. The title will
be “Twenty-five,” after which age the youthful
author protests no one should be guilty of an auto-
biog. Nichols is at present writing theatrical notes
for the Weekly Despatch. When only 19 he pro-
duced a novel about life at Oxford, and -later attracted
notice by his “Little Tales” in the Daily News.
Although the average newspaper office does not
suggest a healthy atmosphere, every old-established
newspaper in Australia is proud of its array of
ancients. The last to say good-bye to one of them
is the S. M. Herald, which has lost J. R. Pegg,
who died at 76, after only a couple of years’
twilight rest. When he retired he was sub-overseer
of the composing room. He was well over 50 years
with the Herald, in whose service he commenced as
an apprentice in 1866.
Sir PERCIVAL PHILLIPS, the London
Daily Mail man, who has been writing
very frank things about Australia.
“S.T.S.”: Strange how localised the range of slang
can be. When I asked A. P. Herbert, the London
Punch writer, if he was getting thoroughly acquainted
with the language, he mentioned that some hospit-
able friends had undertaken to get him a “guernsey”
for a dance —meaning an invitation. When I said
the word was quite unknown to me, he asked: “Well,
do you know the word ‘cobbers,’ meaning friends?”
This term, which we all take for granted, was just
as strange to him as the other. And yet he claimed
to know, and to be fond of, “The Sentimental
Bloke.”
“C.Q.’.’: The absorption of Melbourne Punch by
Table Talk will cause some re-shuffling of portfolios.
Artists Leason and Will Dyson are to do some
Work for the surviving periodical, and according to
present arrangements ex-editor John Dailey goes to
London as a special representative of the Melbourne
Herald, which owned the deceased paper in its
latter, days. The demise of the “new” Punch
Was so gentle that some of the city newsagents even
on Dec. 10 did not know they were handling the
last issue. In dropping a tear for the old Punch,
■One’s sorrow is lightened by the thought that the
venerable sheet had a most expensive funeral.
“Michael Earle” (Vancouver, 8.C.) : Jack London’s
widow manages her late brother’s property, the
Valley of the Moon ranch, at Glen Eden, California;
she takes care of all the practical detail, and helps
at roundups and branding and in the sale-yard. We
were arguing the point once, another fellow and I,
in an office in Sydney, as to whether “The Call of
the Wild” or “The Sea Wolf” was the better book.
True to the instincts of our kind, we took no
notice of a stranger who cable to the counter.
Presently he said, “Excuse me, I know something
about that; ‘The Call of the Wild’ was the better.
Would you mind showing me in to the chief?” He
held out a card. It was Jack'London.
“Vic. Farmer”: After prolonged and painful gesta-
tion the Country party in this State has been
delivered of the Morning Post. The paper, which
was to give expression to the ideals of the V.F.U.,
proves to be merely an “evening paper,” lacking
even the last sad echo of culture which sometimes
floats about the Herald, and issued in the morning
instead of the evening. A statement under huge
cross-headings that “a fire at Herne Hill burnt a
number of chickens” is the most intriguing item
I have been able to find in the course of a close
study of the Post since its initial number. The
only glimpse of a policy I have been able to detect
is that the Country party is in far closer sympathy
With the Laborites it is supposed to fight than
with the Nationalists with whom it is in alliance.
This is interesting and important—if true —but
as I have never yet conversed with a member of the
C.P. who did not yearn to hang or shoot the
more conspicuous “leaders” of the Labor push,”
I am reduced to doubt, even in this matter.
OUR JOB.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
Like crinkled cream with raspberries flushed
Be food for me, bright rose, upthrust
Against my lintel. I will sing
Your loveliness when you are dust,
And when the wind forgets your breath
Rhyme shall recall it out of death.
Oh, shaven grasses, let me lie
Where your bruised blades hold Morning fast,
And the long shadow of the pine
Is like a plume across you cast!
When you in sallow hayricks lean
I shall make glory of your green.
Oh, orange lily, bend your head
. And scorn me not as I go by.
Between the covers of a book
Your majesty some day shall lie!
'•ven the bee that thrums by me
Brings harvest to my granary.
Rose-petals that have lost their seent,
Green grass-blades dipt in summer sheaf,
The grey bibliophile some day
May take my book and turn a leaf
dusty shelves to set you free,
Gold lily and adventurous bee!
So, though I wear a shabby coat,
And strum a lyre with rusty strings,
A thought makes flowers out of words,
And other things than bees have wings.
The green of bannered grass that dies,
Mere poets may immortalise.

Westinghouse
LIGHT & POWER PLANT
Light for the evening,
Power for the day—all
at the turn of a switch
Electricity removes the one
biggest drawback to country
life.
Electricity on the farm, station, or in the
country home provides the same conveniences
enjoyed in the city, it improves the health and
contentment of the whole family, it permits
the performance of many arduous duties at
a saving of both labor and time, and in
general makes living conditions better.
It provides LIGHT, the basis of domestic
comfort. It will provide power for pumping,
milking, separating, grinding, sweeping, wash-
ing, ironing and the sewing-machine, as well
as many other tasks. It will provide power
to operate a water-pressure system, and the
means of fighting fire. It will run electric
fans and the Kelvinator.
A Westinghouse plant is so simple to look
after. There is only one place to oil, for
instance. It is air-cooled, and cannot run too
long, because it stops itself when the batteries
are fully charged.
Westinghouse plants are made by an organisa-
tion employing 50,000 people. Its reputation
is a great one —too great to risk giving any-
thing but the best that engineering science
makes possible. The guarantees covering
Westinghouse installations are unique in the
protection they give the buyer.

nothing to inquire about it. Send in the

“Katja,” written by the facile composer
of “The Girl in the Taxi,” stormed Sydney
on Saturday from the boards of the Royal.
It is at once dramatic and merry and mad,
and the music and the dancing gave Marie
Burke and Warde Morgan almost unlimited
chances of showing that they are front-
rankers in both these lines. Mane as the
exiled Russian Princess, Katja, lias gained
subtly since her first appearance in Aus-
tralia. There is less of strain about her
work, and the whole effect is now rhythmic
rather than jazzy. Her singing was in turn
dramatic and tender, and her gallant en-
trance in a Russian model of turquoise vel-
vet, fur-trimmed, plus a wonderful ikon of
diamonds jambed on her dark hair, quite
devastated impressionable males (and there
are no others), while feasting the eye of
womanhood. In her scenes with Prince Carl
(Warde Morgan), the supposed despot whom
she and her wraith-like brother (Ary de
Leoni) are out to kill, the struggle of her
changing emotions was cleverly shown. Ot
those who snatched success out of the very
mouth of defeat must be numbered comedian
Barrett Lennard; amid a perfect. Sahara of
poor lines lie contrived to be a green oasis
of fun. Margery Hicklin acted and danced
with him, her work, especially in their big
duet, “When We Are Married,” dovetailing
perfectly.
* * * *
Briefly the plot of this rambling edifice ot
drama and fun is that Katja and lier # brother,
exiled nobilitv. think they have Prince Carl
to thank for their banishment. They deter-
mine to slay him in melodramatic manner at
a ball given by Count Orpitch—one of those
glad, bad old men who apparently bestrew
the path of all musical-comedy composers,
and make the introduction of ballets of ladies
with light heads and lighter toes an easy
matter. Katja, instead of knifing the Prince,
is herself wounded to the heart by L)an
Cupid, and the rest of her job is to foil the
conspiracy against his life, and win him tor
her own. Cecil Kellaway, as the flighty

A Frank Rigo
opera season
opened at Syd-
ney Hippodrome
on Saturday night
with “The Barber
of Seville.” The
cast contains some
very good singers,
notably Gild a Pat-
tini (Rosina) and
Fmbaldo Russ o
(Figaro), but of
the bassos Ambrose
Bourke’s Basilic was more upstanding than
Jack Ivinson’s Bartolo. Robert Harper s Al-
maviva seemed a diffident fellow’, but will
probably grow out of that as the. season ad-
vances. Pretty, and charming in her im-
maturity, was Rosina; her acting in spite of
obvious nervousness (it dissolved into te_ars at
the inevitable speeches before the final cur-
tain) was natural, and in the Better scene
full of delicate roguery. The voice is clear,
sweet and true and is never forced. She
chose “The Wren” as her song in the Lesson
scene, and charmed the ear and the fancy.
The Figaro of the piece held up the action
with the applause that followed his Largo
A 1 Factotum” number, and Mary Mac! or-
mick’s Bertha was an extremely good per-
formance. The comedy work of the who e
company is in many places irresistible, ana
the fun of the madcap story never nagged.
Mr. Fossati conducted the orchestra in capi-
tal style, and Henry Staell was its leadei.
“Leave It to Jane” is in its ninth week
at Sydney Majesty’s. The second act did
double duty on Monday, being served in the
afternoon as the piece de resistance at
J.C.W.’s monster gala performance to pro-
vide Christmas dinners for the poor children
of Sydney.

“Charley's Aunt” leaves Sydney Opera
House after to-night (Thursday) to re-

During the next few days Sydney Tivoli
will have a deluge of patrons, because Ella
Shields, matchless impersonator of Picca-
dilly clubmen, is due shortly to leave for
other regions. At the moment she is en-
larging her circle of admirers with a pic-
turesque Spanish sketch in which a ballet of
six co-operates charmingly; there is a new
number entitled “The Bloom on the Heather,”
also “Aussie,” a song of home manufacture and
of last season’s pattern. “Le Petit Cabaret ’
is an odd little playlet performed by Man-
tells’ Marionettes. No fewer than 6U wooden
dolls make their appearance in this amusing
puppet show. Corinne Arbuckle, Peel and
Curtis, and Dorothy Bremmer, who have
been on the premises for some time, have
been joined by Fred Bluett, a valuable acces-
sory.
A flock of new arrivals alighted upon Syd-
ney Pullers’ last Saturday, byit as Robinson
Crusoe is due to discover Friday s. footsteps
at this house on Boxing Day, their sojourn
will be brief. Chief among the immigrants
are Estelle Rose, who excels in character
songs and stories of Yiddish extraction; and
Odette Delage, who adds a sinister touch to
her quite good violin playing by appearing
as a French apache. Tenor Enrico Palmetto,
a citizen of Denmark, sings with an extraor-
dinary fervor for such a stolid Northerner,
and according to the programme Edward and
Hughes serve up “Cutlets of Comedy, but
the cookery is poor.
The moths and butterflies pursued at
Sydney Lyceum are not figures of speech
for giddy home-wreckers, but the real
articles, hunted as a release from her
mother’s bitterness by “The Girl of the
Limberlost,” tlie heroine of Gene Stratton
Poster’s best-seller for homely sentimen-
talists. Of sterner stuff is “Durand of the
Bad Lands,” whose stirring opposition to
a crook sheriff is haunting the drefuns of
Hoyt’s patrons for days. Mabel Normand,
a very old-time comedy actress, reappears
also at the same house as “The Extra Girl.
The fact that Cardinal Richelieu is one of
the main personages in “Under the Red
Robe” is proof that this film version of
a Stanley Weyman romantic novel at the
Piccadilly is rich in the intrigue, chivalry
and gorgeous costuming of the period round
about 1630. “Scaramouclie’s” sword is kept
busy at the Prince Edward, and the Crystal
Palace usherettes see “Zeebrugge” bottled
up a score of times a week.

Saturday night’s performance of “The Mes»-
siah” was one of the best performances to the
credit of the Welsh Choral Society (Sydney).
The choruses brought out light and shade with
thorough artistry under the guidance of E.
11. Jones; there was a stirring and impres-
sive volume of tone in the “Hallelujah.
Ethel Osborn as the soprano rejoiced greatly,
and obtained an emotional effect with “I
Know that My Redeemer Liveth.” V ir-
gmia Bassetti’s sympathetic and creamy con-
tralto, Reginald Gooud’s. resonant bass, and
Molyneux Phillip’s tenor caused enthralling
moments in a notably good production.

An artist who has made a new name :
The new premises of the Australian Fine Art
Gallery in King-street, Sydney, have been opened
with an exhibition of etchings and aquatints by
Sydney Long, A.ILK., who has grown to that glory
from the plain Sid Long of the old rebellious days.
It is a good show, even if one may be inclined to
regard the restraint of the artist as at times too
fine; there is some loss of liveliness to be seen in
seme of our still home-staying artists as a set-off
against mellowed craftsmanship. The stamp of the
approval of galleries in England and Australia, in
which there are many of these 40 items, is upon
Long’s work, the most likeable of which is to be
found in decorative subjects such as “Fantasie,”
“Pan” and “Moonlight Pastoral” ; but “Radmage,
“The Passing Storm” and “The River from Black-
friars Bridge” show the artist’s capacity for expression.
“Lincoln,” however, is a dull architectural drawing,
and the curious trees in “The Home of the Rooks”
are very hard to believe.

“Polly with a Past,” starring Renee Kelly
at Melbourne King’s, is a lightweight Amen-
can farce-comedy, whose theme has been
fried to a frazzle on the gas-rings of many
studios. Its action opens m the N York flat
of Clay Collum and Harry Richardson (I aul
Plunket and George Barraud), who are em-
ployed to make the necessary explanatory
noises which let the audience into the author s
secret. Rex Van Zile (Antony Holies), of the
usual aristocratic Dutch descent and heir to
a large fortune, harbors an unrequited pas-
sion for Myrtle Davis (Dorothy Fane), a
stern young nun' of charity with an urge for
saving other people’s souls. The friends of
Ilex conspire to assist him to obtain the
lady’s favor by inventing a liaison for lam
with a demi-rep. who has served as mistress
to European kings and for whom a world-
famous pianist has just committed suicide.
Polly Shannon (lienee Kelly), the daughter
of a poor Baptist parson who has gone to las
reward, is earning her bread and butter by
doing chores for the conspirators, and she
engages for a price to assume the part of the
(French) lady of breezy virtue. Tha action
then packs up its suit-case and betakes itselt
to the Van Zile summer home, Long Island.
It is there speedily disclosed to the most
unsophisticated playgoer that young Van
Zile will fall in love with Polly and out of
love with Myrtle, and that the Van Zile
mother, learning that the Gallic vamp is
really a poor but respectable member ot
society, will become reconciled to her as a
daughter-in-law. The last act is saved from
crumpling badly by the) advent of the woi Id-
famous musician to announce that the news-
paper reports of his suicide are exaggerated
and by the sub-incision into the plot of
Hylton Allen as a Van Zile uncle who be-
lieves he knows women and especially hand-
some ones.
* * * *
Of the seven brand-new importations in the
cast, Renee Kelly is likely to prove worth
while. She is the modern flapper type that
suits a flapper type of play. A fetching face,
expressive legs and a sentimental manner aie
her portion, though
her spirited show-
ing as the naughty
lady hinted at
weightier ammuni-
tion in her maga-
zine. Antony Holies
provided a neat pic-
ture of a hesitant
young lover; Jack-
son Wilcox was a
satisfactory dead-
beat ; Hylton Allen,
the producer, made
an efficient heavy
uncle; and Doro-
thy Fane a _ very
safe and consistent
Myrtle Davis. The
overdrawn exposi-
tion of Margaret
Damer (Mrs. Van
Zile), however,
warred violently in
the memory with
recollections of the
aristocratic dowa-
jers of Mrs. Brough.

negro “spirituals,” paused at the Assembly
Hall, Melbourne, long enough to deliver two

visit she bore the heat and burden of the
show alone. But she still didn t make this
critic feel that her soul was in those “spirit-

“Caesars Ghost”: The old concession of

there are mummers who still look tor it

which does not justify any demand for re-
duced charges, and whose reputation m
the Trade is that of a finicky, exacting per-
son, more of a pest than a guest, phoned
the manager of a Melbourne hotel to

he said pompously, “that you cater specially
for theatrical artists; what concessions do
you give?” “Twenty per cent, extra tor

the end of the season that he really must

handed him his victuals. “I will get you a

gested.

Dear Sirs, —- _
I have been driving my “Crossley” Car, 15/30 H.P.,
for 12 months, and have covered 10,000 miles on all
classes of roads.
During that time I have travelled through South
Australia,, New South Wales and Victoria on private
and official business, and up till now I have not had
occasion to take a tool out of the case nor been held
up through engine or tyre trouble.
It will 'interest you to know that on the South
Australian trip I covered 1500 miles, carefully check-
ing and measuring the petrol, and I averaged for the
total distance 29 miles to the gallon ; on one section,
from Melbourne to Hamilton, 200 miles, I averaged
32 miles per gallon.
I have only just arrived from Melbourne, and I feel
sure you will be pleased to know we had no trouble of
any sort, and the engine is still running beautifully.
Yours faithfully,
H. W. JAMES,
President of the National Roads Association,

Dear Sirs, —
It gives me pleasure to subscribe to the general
efficiency and all-round dependability of the 15/30
lI.P. “Crossley.”
As you know, it is 15 months since this firm first
purchased a >4 Crossley” Car, and it was not until this
car had been on, the road continuously for 12 mouths
that we had it overhauled.
There were no mechanical defects, and it was the
condition of this car that decided us to standardise
on Crossleys throughout.
The new model appears to be even superior to last
year’s, and if we get the same service from the new
cars that we obtained from the old one we shall be
very satisfied.
Yours faithfully,

Messrs. Crossley Motors (Aust.), Ltd.,
87 William Street,
Sydney,
Dear Sirs, — . . .
1 have pleasure in giving you my experience ot our
15/30 H.P. Model “Crossley” Car.
I find after two years’ daily use, during which period
I have covered a distance of slightly over 30,000 miles,
that the car is just as good as when first purchased.
During the period mentioned repairs have been prac-
tically nil. , . . ,
Four other cars I have had during the past ten
years after about the same running distance were
worn out and disposed of. . , n . ,
Re mileage. I recently tested the car with 24 gal-
lons petrol, 'and covered a distance, city and suburban
running, averaging about 50 stops daily, of 7ao miles,
31 1-5 miles per gallon. One country run to Braid-
wood and the South Coast, 34 miles per gallon. This
is ordinary driving, without any special attention. 1
consider it remarkable for a car of its size. A test
of this kind is, in my mind, the only one of any
benefit to the ordinary user. .
Anyone needing a reliable and comfortaole car, with
plenty of speed, economical as to petrol and tyres and
repairs, will find your 15/30 much cheaper, in spite
of the slightly greater first cost, than most of the much-
boosted cheaper cars on the Australian market; at
any rate, such is my experience—in short, I consider
the car worthy of the reputation of the world-famed
Crossley Firm. Yours faithfully,
ERNEST HILL,

Poverty
Point
“St. John’s” (liond.) : Madame Lily Pay-
ling, contralto, of Sydney, where in other
years she was known by another name, gave
the first of her new series of Albert Hall
concerts on the last evening of October. The
prices were low, the enthusiasm high and
the attendance moderate. Madame Payling
herself sang well and made a speech ot
thanks for the support accorded. Kosina
Buckman, whose waist-line remains gener-
ous, sang with great intelligence; but, as
Australia found on her last tour, her voice
has lost some of that alluring fruity quality
which made it enchanting when Freddy
Shipman first took her through the Common-
wealth. Madame Payling deserves well of
the public in this new venture, albeit the
opening programme was not artistically bal-
CHARGE OF LUCK.
THE FOWL : “Ah all, old hoy—l see Christ-
mas day falls on a Friday this year!
Are you superstitious?"
anced. Her financial position must be more
than sound, for the money expended on
advertisements, halls and fees for these con-
certs and her vocal competitions would be
considered a very handsome income for any
singer not in the exclusive star rank.
“Simon”: Australian tenor Alfred O’Shea
has something to say about the way the
daily newspapers classify their advertise-
ments. He holds it wrong to put grand
opera under the “amusements” heading.
“Grand opera is not an amusement,” he
protests, “it is an education.” Boko Blithers,
a pug. of my acquaintance who sometimes
gets a date at the Stadium, also objects to
the classification which irritates Alfred.
Riding home in the tram after his ten-
rounder with Norky Fisher, Boko opened a
paper and turned to the page on which the
contest had been advertised, employing the
bloodshot eye which Norky hadn’t closed with
a straight left. Nudging me with his elbow
he morosely indicated the word at the top
of the column and spoke bitterly with a
swollen mouth. “Amoosements!” he said.
“Middle Blue” : Vera Remee, who has re-
turned to the stage after some years of
absence, got her first big chance in the Max
Maxwell co. when Beatrice Holloway was
down with typhoid. She was kept busy as
a melo. heroine for a decade or more after
that. Farce is not new to Vera, who was
one of the girls in “Fun on the Bristol” when
C. E. King revised that old laughmaker in
Brisbane, with Walter Cornock in Johnny
Sheridan's old part and Jefferson Tait as
the Captain. Walter Cornock, oddly enough,
started as Sheridan’s call-boy.
“0.H.”: The revival of nigger min-
strelsy at Melbourne Tivoli with Will Whit-
burn as one of the cornermen recalls a
performance at the Victoria Hall, Bourke-
street, on March 17, 1892. On that date
Speight, Ford and Greene, the three Rail-
way Commissioners, were suspended by the
Shiels Ministry, and when night came' Gra-
ham, Outtrim and Peacock, three Cabinet
Ministers, drifted in to “see the minstrels.”
Soon Whitburn had Peacock’s laugli in full
blast. Will stood it uncomplainingly until
it dawned on him that the audience was
treating the Minister for Education as an
auxiliary entertainer. So, stepping to the
edge of‘the platform, he glared at Alec and
asked: “Look here, young ’un, are you run-
ning this show, or am I?” Peacock smiled
louder than ever. He does not laugh so
convincingly now.
“S.T.S.” : The modern Safety First stage
policy of aiming the fatal pistol-shot ob-
viously towards the foot or some other lion-
vital part of the victim may look absurd;
but the danger of doing otherwise has had
one more proof at Port Piric (S.A.). The
Lionel Walsh co., working the country towns
on its way to Westralia, was playing “Little
Nellie Kelly” when Lionel Tower got a
bullet in him. The player pluckily saw
the evening through, but next morning went
into hospital for three days to have the
bullet extracted. Examination of the re-
volver showed that it was loaded with blanks
in every other chamber, and Tower had the
bad luck to get the one live cartridge which
had unaccountably got mixed in.
“Lysander” : In the film called “The Lost
World” there is a tree-felling incident that
is a joy. The party travelling with only
axes for jungle-falling equipment reaches the
top of a towering height, which is the lip of
a yawning gulf. Standing near is the only
tree for miles, its seed sown no doubt by a
straying pterodactyl. Fallen just right, it
will bridge the unbridgeable. The hero ad-
vances on the tree, axe. poised over shoulder.
He sets out manfully to ringbdrh it! Under
the light scarf of Bark that tree is neatly
sawn, through ; they must have grown that
way in the brontosaurian age! The axeman
completes his ring, a camp-follower gives
the trunk a light tug with a rope and the
tree drops gracefully across the chasm.
“Hamfat”: The Allan Wilkie co. took a
three weeks’ respite from its strenuous life
prior to opening at Hobart. Wilkie himself
enjoyed his ease on Bruni Island, where he is
monarch of all he. surveys. The useful Gus
Neville has left the co.—he is a leading actor
in Ray Longford’s latest film, “The Pioneer”
—after having been with it since Wilkie
started in Australia. Neville’s place is taken
by John Cairns, who has been leading man
in S’Africa, and was with Benson in Eng-
land.
“C.Q.” : The. importing craze has suffered
a check as regards male comedians. Gus
Bluett (“W ildflower’), Atliol Tier (“Leave
it to Jane”) and Roy Rene, whose humor
stops the play in “Give and Take,” have
shown that Australian talent can do as well
as any Yankee or English requisition. Joe
Brennan is another indigene. He is to draw
the laughs in “Jack and the Beanstalk,” the
new Ward panto, at Melbourne.
“Machete”: That J. M. Barrie should
have been roused to fury by the proposed
revival of “Walker of London” is not sur-
prising, for the long-forgotten farce-comedv
is very far removed from the little man’s
later manner. As Barrie admits having sold
it, with all rights, as far back as 1592, it is
difficult to see how he can prevent its pro-
duction. Possibly the rusty barb is poisoned
by the fact that Barrie met his first and only
wife while she was playing in “Walker,” and
the marriage w-as a sad failure.
A handful from “A.G.M.” (Loud.) :
T-he highbrows of the weekly papers have been no
kinder to Oscar Asche’s “Good Old Days” than their
brothers of the morning press. James Agate, in the
Sunday Times, delivered himself with unusual
violence. “It would have been a charming piece,”
he said, “if every word in the book had been dis-
carded and if the principals had been endowed .with
greater talent.” The Observer man dipped deeper
in gall and said: ‘lndeed, Mr. Asche’s first entrance
seemed like something that Hell itself had spewed
out upon the homely scene.” Pretty Eve Grey, of
Sydney, has a part in this play, and' uses her light
singing voice with refinement and effect. In order
to give a fillip to the story a few more hounds
have been introduced into the hunting scene, but the
show would not be likely to have much of a lease
of life even, if Asehe engaged a whole menagerie.
Pavlova of the thistledown feet has concluded her
very successful season at Covent Garden. When she
appears in Australia next March she is sure to
create a sensation, as there is no artist to surpass
her. She will be accompanied to Sydney by 37
assisting dancers, and will give the programmes with
which she has just delighted London. Pavlova enacts
the role of great lady as well as that of great
dancer. At her Hampstead home she constantly
entertained on a grand scale, her guests includirg
Cabinet Ministers, ambassadors and their wives,
Judges and the most exclusive members of the nobility.
It used to be said in the days of her early residence
in London that the exalted character of her guest-
list was due to the fact that she was a high officer
in the Intelligence Department of the Czar’s Govern-
ment.
The London production of “The Silver Fox” has
THE SEASON’S STAR.
At work. At knock-off time.
aroused interest that stopped short of enthusiasm.
The play has been accepted as a rather attractive
jumble of comedy, tragedy and farce, generally arti-
ficial but often amusing. On the first night it
stepped with rather leaden feet, and seemed over-
weighted with artificiality; vet the often clever
humor of much of the dialogue and the novelty of
the situations give a Certain impression of freshness
that may carry the piece to a fair run. Lawrence
Grossmith is repeating- his Australian success in the
leading part.
Not for many years have there been such scenes
of enthusiasm in a London theatre as on Nor-ember
3 at the Lyceum when Ellaline Terriss returned to
the West-End stage after an absence of six years.
The play was “The Man in Dress Clothes,” with her
husband (Seymour Hicks) arj her daughter Betty
in the cast. Although the piece affords only limited
scope for Miss Terriss, her appearance provoked
astonishing fervor. Twice during the evening, she
had to make speeches of thanks. Mr. Hicks also
spoke, and the mother kissed her daughter in the
exuberance of the moment. Immense numbers of
bouquets were heaped on the stage at the close
of the performance. Among the many notable social
and stage people present on the first night were
Australia’s old G.-G. Lord Dudley and his lady—
the latter used to be Gertie Millar, an old Gaiety
colleague of Miss Terriss.
“Adamascus” : Gus Bluett, now well in the
limelight, figured with his father in a Boy
Scout act at the Brisbane Cremorne nine or
ten years ago. A very awkward youngster
in those days, lie seemed to have mistaken
his vocation. It was when he toured Queens-
land with the Nell Fleming co. in such plays
as “Fair and Warmer” that he gave the first
indications of having some acting stuff in
him. The clumsy lad is now a self-possessed
and personable young man, with a distinct
talent for playing silly-ass parts, as he has
shown in “Wildflower.” He owes much to
father Fred, who has coached him thoroughly
—and he must have been a trying pupii.
Fred Bluett, to my mind, is the best music-
hall comedian Australia has had, although
this statement, I know, will excite the wrath
of the old-timers wdio swear by Will Whit-
burn.
“Goldilocks”: The adventurous Frank
Hurley has completed his “Pearl of the South
Seas” picture for the Oswald Stoll syndicate,
and is now filming “The Jungle Woman”: —
it is his own scenario. When Hurley was
shooting “Pearls and Savages” he fell out
with the Papuan Administrator, and on re-
turning he found that he had not been for-
given. So he has taken his team to Dutch
New Guinea, where his chief trouble is
translating sonnets addressed by sighing
Hollanders to the belle of the outfit.
“S. Gumm”: N.S.W. School-inspector
Fraser, addressing a conference of teachers
at Goulburn, appealed to them to encourage
the Australian moving-picture industry by
getting the children to appreciate films made
in their own country. The appeal would be
enthusiastically responded to if our Amal-
gamations and Chauvels and Shirleys went
in for the production of short moving-picture
stories dealing worthily with romantic events
in Australian history, from the whaling days
to the Great War, and there is no reason why
they should not when the Commonwealth
Parliament comes to light with an effective
tariff. Unfortunately too many Australian
films have been idiotic imitations of Holly-
wood in its most fatuous mood. No teacher,
however patriotic, could recommend his
pupils to see “Painted Daughters,” or the
latest and silliest production of Beaumont
Smith.
“A.G.M.” (Lond.) ; Edward Knoblock’s
new play, “Lullaby,” produced at the Globe
during the first week of November, is obvi-
ously meant for the films. Many of the
plays seen at West End theatres this year
would never have reached that theatrical
eminence but for
the screen. Hence
the large number
of failures after
very elaborate
launc h i n g. In
Knoblock’s latest
effort the heroine's
sin-stained misfor-
tunes have so little
relation to inevita-
bility that they en-
tirely lack convic-
tion in the drama-
tic sense. In the
Opinion of St. John
Ervin e “Lullaby”
might more appro-
priately have been
named “The Pros-
titute's Progress.”
The lea ding
woman \s part, oil
which the whole
production depends,
was played by Mar-
garet Baunerman,
the young Cana-
dian actress who
took London by
storm in “Our Bet-
ters.” She is seen
first as a betrayed village maiden, and
on through various stages until the epilogue
reveals her as a broken harridan with no
illusions left.
“Maolsa”: It has been my nightly task for
years to fit appropriate music to Hollywood
films, and the job has become tiresome be-
yond expression. There is just an endless
succession of storms, fires, stampedes and
sloppy heroes who suddenly go in for stunt-
ing and as suddenly become sloppy again.
Years ago there were breaks ill the mono-
tony, especially when Neilan was turning out
films like the one called “Life”—a really fine
picture which, of course, failed to draw—
but Neilan’s later efforts have been purely
Hollywooden, like all the rest. The trouble
is that so many newspaper reports of film-
showings are written up from the elaborate
publicity matter that accompanies
from Hollywood. If honest criticism of
photoplays were the rule instead of the
rare exception, my position might not be the
horror it is.
“St. John’s’’ (Lond.) : Bruce Bairns-
fatlier’s latest “Old Bill’’ stage adventure,
“Carry On, Sergeant,” at the New Oxford,
so obviously dates back to other days and
other tastes that its run is not likely to be
long. Some of the language is strong
enough even for a military smoke-room of
the present. On the opening night a man in
the upper circle, at the end of one scene,
loudly exclaimed “Disgusting!” and the
sentiment met with considerable approval.
“Ca?sar’s Ghost”: J. C. Williamson, Ltd.,
did good business for itself in taking over
the little pub originally associated with Her
Majesty’s, Sydney—it was a beer emporium
on the Market-street corner—and turning
the acquired space into offices, with a show-
window for a department store. The green-
room yarn is that the reconstruction has
been so profitable that the Firm gets the use
of the theatre for nothing. The capital
value of Sydney playhouses has soared
amazingly of recent years, but the upward
flight may be arrested by the opening of
Fullers’ two new theatres and the one which
a syndicate headed by two “sports” is going
to build. On the other hand, Sydney’s
ability to keep theatres going is an expand-
ing quantity. People who exist in flats must
have places to live in during the long even-
ings.
“Lond”: Drury-lane Theatre, for many
years the home of melodrama, has been on a
bad wicket lately, bnt the co. that runs it
has just got back on the dividend-paying list,
though only 5 p.c. so far. This is entirely
owing to “Rose Marie.” Alfred Butt, the
chairman, told the annual meeting of share-
holders that the co.’s manager, who went
across to see this joyous musical comedy in
New York, condemned it; but he (Butt)
gave an exactly opposite opinion, whereupon
the manager resigned. And “the London suc-
cess of ‘Rose Marie’ from the start, six
months ago, was phenomenal.”
PANTO.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
The yellow gaslights of the past;
The open shops a-glare;
The hansoms “clopping,” proud and fast,
With gay folks here and there;
The magic that all Stageland held
To childish eyes—how plain
Come visions that our young minds spelled,
Now Panto.’s here again!
Though barber Time has shaven crowns
And bloated many a girth,
The bouncing “boys,” the dames and clowns,
Reviving boyhood’s mirth,
Once more with eagerness we’ll meet,
Forgetting passing time;
And laughter loud the old jokes greet
That live in pantomime.
Old jokes? Old friends that memories wake
Our best vcung days recall!
Though we’re the old ’uns now who take
Youth to the festival,
Still in our hearts once more we’re boys
And glad for Christmas come,
And that the pudding of its joys
Still holds the Panto plum.

THE ELEY GASTIGHT
WATER-RESISTING CARTRIDGE
Sportsmen have long appreciated the fine shooting qualities of the Eley
gastight cartridge—“the standard by which quality is judged.’’
This standard has now been raised: the case, giving the same fine
shooting, is now made water-resisting as well, and is consequently
becoming more than ever popular.
After testing these cartridges “The Field” described their pressures and
velocities as “ excellent ,” their turnovers as “in every case firm anti
strong ,” and their resistance to damp or water as “far superior to any
other make of cartridge

ENOs “FRUIT SALT”
The World-Famed Effervescent Saline
FIFTY-ODD years ago ENO’s “ Fruit Salt ” was regarded as an
elegant preparation. The adjective seems nowadays a trifle out
of fashion, but no bther word so aptly suggests the purity and
delicacy of this famous health saline.
The sterling merits of ENO have won for it the friendship of the world at
large. ENO provides that assistance to Nature which modern life has made
necessary. ENO contains no flavouring matter, no sugar, no purgative
mineial salts, and unlike some of the drastic aperients, does not form an undesir*
able habit, but can be taken at any time with perfect safety by young or old.

George H.: Agree with every word you
say. All we are concerned about is that the battler
shall not be handicapped out of the struggle to get
a start for himself on the land. Ramshead: We
went to sleep at page 11....R.E.: “Rimbaud”
pushed out by the crush of applicants with a stronger
Australian appeal... .M.C.1.: Don’t worry; we don’t.
Certainly the poor little thing, itself moribund, did
have rotten luck in printing the article just at that
moment.... Piscis: Too clumsy.... W.M.C.: Dull;
and dulness is the deadly sin... .Nikko: “Distribu-
ter” or “distributor,” our dictionary says; but there
are no alternative spellings for “gauge” and “con-
sensus” A.J.F.: Sorry, but lack of space compels
us to confine the row to the two disputants Hugh
L.; That tough bit of meat had been well chewed
before your contribution arrived.... Discus: What
makes you write things like that? Perhaps your
hair wants cutting. Try it. Try anything
Wompah: Yes, there was an explorer named Barclay
(1877) ; but the tableland wasn’t called after him
• —Sir Hy. Barkly, Governor of Victoria, provided
it with a name nearly 20 years earlier... .F.H.8.;
Quite unworthy of that beautiful penmanship....
AV.T.J.: Doesn’t make us want to hug it... .E.R.8.:
Not enough interest.. . .M.H.H.: Too much preach-
ing.... White Owl; They both miss the perch....
J.R.L.: Commonplaces dished up in bad verse and
shaky grammar... .E.M.8,: “Concert” not quite
well enough done....N.P. (Armidale): The same
eld lament; and neither very attractive nor very
true... .R.H.0.; You don’t seem to have much idea
of verse; and the words you use carry little or no
meaning.... Emsee; It’s all a bit thin, raw and imi-
tative... .Una C.: Both fall far short. .. .MeC.R.:
The thought is weak and the verse ragged
J.8.D.; Pretentious and empty verse of bad con-
struction .... Barbara L.: The lines are too rugged
to carry it.... Anonym; It’s almost bad enough to
turn the office-paste sour.. ..W.A.G.: All of them
miss, but some of them graze the target... .W.D.F.:
That yarn begins well, but gets to nothing....
F.J.H.: Horrible story with no point. The verse
is too crude in shape... .J. 5.8.: Verse weak and
grammar horrible... .C.L. (Kensington) : The yarn
doesn’t move us... .A.M.8.8.: Very p00r... .A.D.M.:
A sonnet should be more than three quatrains and
a couplet. The matter of the verses does not quite
carry them.... Marjorie F.: You oughtn’t to leave
loose, rhymeless lines kicking in that way.... Mar-
garet K.: Your verse falls into all sorts of shapes,
yet never gets away from the commonplace.... Reg
R.: It has no sonnet movement and no freshness of
idea; one line halts badly; one alleged rhyme is
false... .Susan R.; It has some distance yet to
climb... .M.P. (Mudgee) : The matter is better
than the form. Unless some effect is gained by
their absence there should be rhymes to all the
lines.... A.C.: Not up.... Alan B.: Too weak; and
you can’t rhyme “athwart” with “thought”
F.E.R.: Not badly done, but it leaves us c01d....
El Haste: Terrifying.... Ripponlea: The most 'strik-
ing description of a proposal we have met for a
long time: —
Unsteady and weak
But determined to speak
In spite o’ his doubts and fears,
He sounded a note
Within his throat
Like a learner changing gears.
Helpless with tension,
He managed to mention;
“Miss Penhalluriack—l—believe me, I beg—
I feel carried away;
I’m—what shall I say ?
My heart is as full as an egg.”
Sighing, she just
Collapsed on his bust,
Then kissed his jaw so haggard.
And midst his face
A smile took place,
As homeward he rapturously staggard.
R.G.W.: Not quite bright enough. Also, the
wattle does its dash quite a long time before
Christmas W. 8.8. (Day’s Bay) ; The sonnet calls
for better workmanship... .1.W.: Not enough fresh-
ness about it....E.D. (Perth): The subject is not
specially attractive, and the lines move rather heavily.
....Bill; Too loose and rugged. .. .E.J.0.: Not
enough there.. . .J.S.D.; It moves along easily, but
says nothing new Grom: Very poor Chhota:
It bumps along, making obvious remarks as it goes.
O.H.W.: “The Trees” are not very enticing
vegetables.... A. 8.: No market for long screeds of
blank verse. The sonnet is better, but hasn’t enough
interest... .U.R.E.: The dying typewriter taps its
departure painfully, particularly when it rhymes
“war” with “saw”. ...P. O. Mac: Very little there.
....Billy O.; Uncle Joe is too crude... .Carysfort:
True enough, but you don’t make it an interesting
sermon.... Maud W.: Even verse must bend to law
and order in some respects J.R.L.: One thrilling
quart of the beer-drinking narrative:—
The usual way is to open the mouth
And so put an end to the parching drouth;
But to close the mouth and still to drink beer,
Ah that is a method most terrible queer.
An English cricketer, one Tom Emmett,
Appeared to us just about the limit.
“ ’Ave a drink, Tom?” a friend once said,
For he thought Tom looked like as if he’s half-dead.
“Aw’ right,” said Tom with the rubicund nose,
No poetry ’bout him but just deadly prose.
“ ’Ave a pint, Tom?” another friend inquired,
Looking much like an idiot who’s inspired.
“Yes, to both of you,” said Tom in his brogue,
As he cast his boiled-fishy eyes on the rogue,
“Just draw us a couple o’ pints o’ beer,”
For no middle course could Tom Emmett steer.
TO ARTISTIC (AND INARTISTIC)
CORRESPONDENTS.
H.W.T.: As heavy as the suet pudding they make
at our boarding-house... .C.R.N.: Cedric and his
facetious friend shown the d00r... .M.G. (Wentworth
Falls): Not in a billion years... .W.A.H.: Hovers
between Stand a Chance and Try Again... .P.A.8.:
Fair drawing, joke too mystifying... . J.P.R.
(F.M.S.): Don’t blame Bill. His two wretchedly
drawn cobbers obviously drove him to suicide....
M.G. (Bendigo): As smoky as the inside of a
chimney... .R.R.: Finicky studies of damsels in a
state of semi-nudity declined. .. .R.H.: Have seen
better raffled at a church bazaar.
“Coot”: “Wang’s” par. (19/11/’25) re-
garding persons with strings of letters after
their names reminds me' of - the man who
printed after his name the letters 8.A., D.J.
Upon inquiry as to what they represented, he
explained that D..T. stood for “de jure” (by
right)—lie should have got his 8.A., but had
been plucked by a prejudiced examiner.

to Skin an d /fair/
That natural beauty of skin and hair which
cannot be imitated can be obtained by regular
use of Rexona Skin and Facial Soap. Ordinary
toilet soaps do not assert this influence. Many of
them contain free alkali, which tends to dry the
skin and destroy its delicate texture. Even the best
of such soaps can only cleanse; they cannot heal
and protect the skin.
Rexona Soap contains the same soothing, Heal-
ing, antiseptic balsams as Rexona, the Rapid Healer,
the value bf which in the treatment of skin affec-
tions is known throughout the world. Simply use
Rexona Skin and Facial Soap regularly once or
twice a day, and see if it does not quickly soothe
and cleanse the pores, lessen the tendency to pimples,
and leave the complexion clear, fresh and velvety.

“Adelaide”: Our American cousiu hasn't
troubled yet to learn much about liis good—
too good—customers on this side. South Aus.
has just imported 26 taxis for a Yellow Cab
Co. And every one of the cases had painted
on it in big letters the direction : “Adelaide,
N.S.W.”
“Keppel”: The Queensland cattle-owner
has worn a satisfied grin lately. At Knog-
gera yards a pen of bullocks from Killarney,
each weighing over 10001 b., fetched an aver-
age of £l6 10s,; another consignment of five
brought £l7 12s. 6d; apiece. Other prices
varied from £l7 12s. 6d. down to £7 9s. 9d.,
the latter being the average secured for 60
bullocks from St. Lawrence. But the prices
will not last, judging from overseas quotes,
although there are hopes that next year's
prices will be better than this year’s.
* * * *
“Keppel” : J. W. Pohlmann, of Maryborough
(Q-), has invented a process whereby tar
will mix with water. Some recent experi-
ments in Brisbane indicate that it may meet
a long-felt want as a dust-layer. The mix-
ture, which possesses disinfectant properties,
can be applied with cold water and wili
pass through the finest atomiser. It is
claimed that it is cheaper than water-
sprinkling, and that a single application
will bind the dusty surface of a street and
make it impervious to rain, just as if the
surface had been tar-painted. #
“Jimmy Possum”: Bananaland has at
least two timbers—native elm ( Apliananthe
philippinensis) and whalebone-tree (Pseu-
domorus brunoniana ) —suitable for axe-
liandles (B. 5/11/’25). The wood of both
is white, heavy when green and very pliable.
The trees do not attain any great girth, but
grow fairly tall, and occur only in scrubs,
chiefly patches of rain-forest along the coast.
So pliable is the whalebone that a tree 60ft.
high and lOin. or so in diameter sft. from
the base will bend to the ground without
snapping. Cudgerie ( Flindersia schotti-
ana), a white wood, also makes good
handles; where it is available, cockies use
it largely for making shafts for hoes and
mattocks.
* * * 9
“Tomb”: Tn the Rockhampton (Q.)
Botanic Cardens there is a fine specimen of
the Florida swamp cypress ( Taodium dis-
tichum) which, though not yet 20 years old,
has a girth-measurement of 106 i inches at
breast-height. In the last 12 months it has
put on 41 inches round the waist. The
Queensland Forest Service has planted some
thousands of seedlings—the progeny of this
tree—at its Byfield plantations, and, if
similar success is experienced, Central
Queensland will soon have more softwood to
draw upon. Finns insignis is generally re-
garded as holding the belt in the quick-
growing class, but the imported tree has
issued a challenge.
* * * *
“Osmi”: Speaking of high prices for flour
(B. 19/11/’25), when the Adams River
(Tas.) osmiridium rush was in full swing
some months ago flour cost £l3 10s. for a
1501 b. bag, although the field is only 25
miles from a railway-station. One digger
on good metal bought £3 12s. worth of
potatoes and onions, and had to pay over
£25 for freight. In the beginning, goods for
the field had to be hand-packed a good part
of the way, as the country was too rough and
scrubby for horses. Packers got £3 for
carrying a 501 b. pack seven miles ; some of
them knocked up £2O per week. Since the
track has been cut and horses have been
coming through, packing charges have
dropped considerably.
* * * *
“Julian”: Yes, there are timbers other
than American hickory suitable for axe-
handles. During the war years, when the
ninepenny handle soared to 4s. and was hard
to get even at that price, necessity sent us
looking for substitutes. I was on a big clear-
ing contract in Westralia at the time, and
got into the habit of carving handles out of
any timber that came handy. Malice, gimlet,
york-gum and jamwood—l tried them all,
and the results were so satisfactory that we
bought no more handles at inflated prices.
The stick chosen for a handle should be at
the right stage—neither too young, when it
lacks durability, nor past maturity, when it
loses springiness. We got good results by
storing the newly-made handles up the chim-
ney, where they were smoke-dried. Of the
timbers in N. S. Wales, white myrtle and
silky-oak gave the best service.
TREASURE IN HEAVEN.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
“She asked to see defendant’s pass-book and was
told that her husband had it in Heaven.” —Cabled
report of an English case.
Amid the rainbow lustres and the glory
Of those high fields where walk with folded wings
Tall angels in low talk with saints, whose hoary
Grey locks are haloed with imaginings
Too fine to compass with a mortal thought,
Some little dust of this old earth is caught.
Though gold beyond all counting has been squandered
In making pavements for immortal feet,
It seems they still possess a money standard
And that their banking systems are complete;
Their real needs in Heaven may be few,
But even saints can give an lOU.
Perhaps they still know agent, tout and broker;
And it may be throughout the languid days
That Abraham and Jones sit down to poker,
Or someone backs a horse with wings—and pays.
In any case, to make a heavenly dash
It still appears that you require some cash.
So when a simple maiden in her blossom
Becomes a medium for the spirit throng,
Though mild her speech and sleek as an opossum,
The need of cash is evermore her song.
Don’t fancy that she wants it just to spend;
It’s Heaven’s remittance that she has to send.
Bread on the waters is a proposition
Which often has returned quite cent, per cent.;
Treasure in Heaven is useful in addition,
A sort of background to the glory spent,
And he who backs a bill for brave St. Peter
Can make the option on his wings completer!
N.S.W.

REX-PYE, packed in 1 lb. and
hygienic cans, in a delicious jelly, is the
tastiest treat cooked ready to serve,
and the most economical meat meal you
can obtain. You will find, as thousands
have found, that each tin is consistently
of the same outstanding choice quality.
This, due to the facts set out below,
accounts for the triumphal march of
REX-PYE into popular favor.

This is why we claim that REX-PYE is the finest meat in the world:
1. The tin itself is unique, being stamped out and seamless; hermetically sealed without
solder (lead) or soldering flux—it is the perfectly hygienic container.
2. The meats (raw materials) are perfectly wholesome, being choicest quality, carefully
selected. Visitors from abroad, inspecting our works, have said that the meats are
superior to those used at any other factory in their experience.
3. The spicing by a recipe in our sole possession and the excellent jelly help to produce
the delicious flavor characteristic of REX-PYE.
4. The cooking en casserole preserves all the wholesome meat juices, and retains the high
food values.
All these facts combine to produce a meat product of unrivalled quality. Thus we account
for that delicate aroma as you open the tin, and that delicious flavor when the dainty is
eaten.
your Grocer for REX-PYE
—the finest meat in the world.
Look for the attractive label.
I nutations are offered for sale, but
they are decidedly not REX-PYE.
Its delicate aroma and delicious flavor
distinguish it from all other meats.

A lady witness who recently appeared in
the Supreme Court at Ballarat surely holds
the record as the oldest person to enter a
witness-box in Australia. She confessed to
being 95.
“Quantas,” which is the short name for
Queensland and Northern Territory Aerial
Services, commenced its fourth year of opera-
tions last month. It is able to boast that
in its first three years its pilots have flown
over 300,000 miles without any injuries
to either officers or passengers.
Laird Smith, one-time Minister for the
Navy, has gone back to the plough: he has
a good little farm near Burnie (Tas.), and
when he drives in a small draft of lambs
to the local market he generally tops it. He
has only two public jobs nowadays—he sits
in the Emu Bay Council and, as a member
of the committee of the local show, is the
Burnie representative on the body that more
or less regulates the affairs of all the State's
shows.
“Muts”: I am curious to know how
“R. 8.” (B. 3/12/’25) satisfied the College
of Heralds about the validity of his claim
to be a descendant from Catherine Parr, the
last wife of Henry VIII. Catherine before
she married the stout monarch was a child-
less widow. She had no issue by Henry ; and
after the royal death she married in the same
year (1547) Lord Thomas Seymour, of
Sudcley. In the following year (1548) she
died in childbirth. There is no record of
her having left any children.
With the cemetery at West-terrace, just on
Adelaide city boundary, spreading steadily—
an attempt to go out some miles to the
northward was abandoned a few years back
—the City Council was asked to take up
officially the one clean method of disposing
of the dead. It has decided not to do so,
and the old, insanitary method of burial will
continue. Incidentally, the figures of the
crematorium for the 30 years of its existence
show that, though many prominent men have
by their own instructions been cremated, the
general patronage has been poor, and quite
insufficient to make it a commercial proposi-
tion. Public opinion needs educating.
The birthday of Melbourne’s latest alleged
millionaire, T. M. Burke, falls on an appro-
priate day for a man who has devoted so
much attention to the acquisition of bullion.
His natal day is June 30—the end of the
financial year. At 53 he is still young—a
restless spirit and a tireless worker. He has
two hobbies, racehorses and the “Develop
Australia” League, of which he is the
founder and life’s blood. The League is
unique in that it will not accept donations.
Burke made his money out of suburban sub-
divisions, after helping to lose a good deal
for the civil servants of Vic. in their co-
operative store.
“Moe”: What constitutes a record yield
per acre for any kind of crop in Aus-
tralia? The strawberry-growers at Warr-
nambool (Vic.) must have come pretty close
to it. Some of them have made as much
as £3BO an acre from their land in good
seasons; one grower, in fact, netted just on
£4OO, but that was several years ago. At
Cleveland, near Brisbane, where the land is
not nearly so good, some growers have taken
from £250 to £3OO an acre. But the crops
are very susceptible to disease and weather
conditions, and it takes very little to ruin
them.
Douglas Saunders writes from Chicago :
Anent the paragraph about the Rev. A. G. B. West
(B. 18/7/’25), lately in Australia to promote immi-
gration from the Cold Country. At the time he
arrived from England to take charge of St. Augus-
tine’s, Adelaide, I was a 12-year-old constrained to
make regular weekly attendance. 1 remember that
one of his first innovations was to instal a verger.
The official was armed with two 18ft. poles, with
which he would reach over and crack us on the
head when we became talkative or restless. The
parson himself was the idol of us young boys; a
fine athlete himself, he encouraged us in boxing,
swimming and crick.et. I remember that he gave
out from the pulpit the banns of his own marriage.
“Schnorrer” : The quaint midget figure of
“Rabbi” Mestal, of the East Melbourne Syna-
gogue, will be missing for some time; he is
off to England to earn the right to the title
which the thoughtless Gentile already gives
him, believing that every Jewish minister is a
Rabbi —which is tantamount to believing that
every other sort of parson is a Doctor of
Divinity. During the time Mestal is collect-
ing the much-desired rabbinical diploma he
will have his salary and all expenses paid by
his congregation; and, on his return, Aus-
tralia, which a few years ago harbored only
two—veteran Dr. Abrahams (Melbourne)
and F. L. Cohen (Sydney)—will hold five
Rabbis, the others being Brodie (Melbourne)
and Freedman (Perth).
“Clerk”: The Vic. Railways’ new store-
house at Spotswood, which covers 12 acres,
has 123 racks and 46 packing-counters, with
two Bft. passages running the whole length of
the building. The Yankee “11. C. Pearce”
system of storekeeping has been adopted;
the storehouse is divided into eight groups,
and each again subdivided into 15 sections.
The articles are carried in racks or trays, the
total number on hand being posted conspicu-
ously. Roughly, about 12,000 different items,
ranging from needles to electric cranes, are
stored, 700,000 requisitions have to be met
each year, and at a moment’s notice the staff
can ascertain the supply of each item on
hand. Before the introduction of this system
the railways used to carry stores valued at
24 millions ; now less than a million’s worth
suffices.
Dr. Emanuel Lasker, the recognised chess
master of the world since he won the cham-
pionship in 1894 (two years before that he
had become champion of England, and in
1893 of America), has been eclipsed at last
by a new star, one Bogoljubow, a Ukranian,
wdio triumphed at a tournament held in
Moscow. The winner scored 15 points out of
a possible 20, and the Cuban player, Capa-
blanca, at one time regarded as a pheno-
menon, was third with 134 —he was handi-
capped by losing two games early, being “off
his game”; even chessplayers suffer from
that. The sensation of the tournament was
the defeat of Lasker by a boy from Mexico,
young Carlos Torre, who is acclaimed as the
world’s future champion. Lasker, who runs
a chess journal and is a writer of books
upon geometry, does not regard chess as a
rrv>rention; his relaxation is tennis. He is
57 now.

Backache! Why?
Do you rise in the morning with a groan? Do you feel
that you are getting old? Having made up your mind that
you are a martyr, do you vent your ill-humor on the family?
After a while the pain and stiffness leave you and you forget
your troubles until the next morning, when the same dull pain
in the small of your back, the difficulty of bracing your nerves,
brings back all the dire forebodings of the day before.
This is the way Kidney Trouble creeps on its victim and
you are starting on a long journey towards ill-health and
infirmity. The kidneys are overtaxed with the work of cleans-
ing out the impurities from your blood. Each day there is an
accumulation of waste which must upset the body. It forms
Eric Acid and Uric Acid is the most insidious form of poison-
ing that can take place in your body. The number of ills
to which it leads is almost limitless and though middle age is
the most favorable season for their activity, even the youngest
child often suffers and sometimes dies from the different mani-
festations of Kidney Trouble.
A change of diet is an advisable precaution, but a reliable,
specially-prepared remedy, such as Dr. Sheldon’s Gin Pills, is
the safeguard for your health. '
Dr. Sheldon’s Gin Pills stimulate your sluggish kidneys to
re-action and assist the work of removing impurities from
your blood, which the kidneys have been unable to accomplish
unassisted. Then their tonic action so revives the kidneys that
are filtering the blood that the w T ork is done automatically as
by a perfect machine. Your back straightens up, the pulling,
dragging feeling gradually leaves you; in the morning you can
leap from bed, feeling a glow of health and vigor and meet
life with a smiling face.
It is the duty of every man, not only to himself but to
the world at large, to keep his health in the proper condition
for his daily task; and for the victim of Kidney Trouble Dr.
Sheldon’s Gin Pills give just the little boost his organs need to
make them his slave, instead of his being a slave to ill-health.

CROSSING the moor came singing
Alice;
Worship gushed from the glad young
throat of her.
Glear eyes woke in each sundew chalice,
Skylarks dropped lest they lose a note ot
lior
As through the bracken and heath-waves her
way
She waded with hands brushing color m
spray,
Breathing was rapture to Alice —
The faith and the wonder of virgin day!
Round the starred wedding-bush bees were
agile, . .
Tiny blue butterflies curtsied to each
blossom;
Flowers on the tea-tree were porcelain fragile,
White like plum bloom, pink like peach
blossom.
Azure and ivory and scarlet the wild
Glowed for the welcome of summer and smiled
And for the bright feet of Alice,
Airy as wings, in its honeyed store.
Alice was singing (and what did it matter
If the words mixed in a saucy insanity,
Breaking and blending with larks’ sweet
chatter?)
“Strawberry Fair” and “The Golden
Vanity.”
Simple folk’s tales like a daisy chain strung
To melodies old when her grandsires were
young—
“ Hares on the Mountains,” sang Alice,
Tip-toe where moon-green fuchsias hung.
All adoration, unconscious, all glory,
One with the wild garden's guileless
hilarity,
Bell notes she added to morn’s ringing story,
Incense aspiring to Heaven’s high clarity.
Life was sheer beauty, and life was God,
Not grim, but a lovely youth ecstasy-shod—-
Even such another as Alice!
Flittering birds were her Teet that trod.
Sudden she saw near her steps unheeding
A little trapped animal, just to the right of
her,
Gripped by a soft limb, broken and bleeding.
Frantic with agony, slain by the sight of
her,
It leapt at her horror and died with a
scream! . . .
Life bared teeth in a devil’s gleam—
“Oh, God. I hate You!” cried Alice,
Never so young since that bludgeoned dream.

[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
JASON drove the cart through the gate
which opened off the road, and jolted
along the path round the hill to the
main creek crossing.
From the house Grandpa watched his
progress eagerly; but once the bend had
swallowed the cart the old man left his
perch outside the shanty door and hobbled
inside.
Crow’s Creek came down the hills like a
serpent, winding and writhing, doubling right
back on itself at times. It was serpent-
colored, too, in places; dark and sluggish,
flecked with gold spots where the sunlight
struck down through the trees that lined the
bank. Jason’s little farm, which he and
Grandpa had inhabited together since the
final dissipation of a gradually thinning
family, was at the base of the hill in one
of the creek’s great bends. The trees were
cleared away there, and the sun shone on the
water.
There was no verandah to Jason’s little
shanty, but a pepper-tree flung its protect-
ing branches over the iron roof and shadowed
the front, where was Grandpa’s chosen rest-
ing-place. From there he could see, across
the creek and tho level, sparsely-timbered
paddocks, clear to the town, which com-
menced its straggling two miles away.
He could see Jason’s orchard, too, and it
impressed him. The lovely lacework of early
blossom and the soft, translucent green that
carpeted the creek-sides burst on him with
all the breathlessness of novelty. “Ain’t
that beautiful, now!” he had appealed
to the dutsty collie curled at his feet. But
the collie had merely snuffled once or twice
and gone to sleep again. He was an old
dog, blind, and his teeth were gone.
Grandpa was old. too. So old that he
scarcely remembered his years. But, un-
like the dog. tho spring worried him vaguely.
The new life, the triumphant birth around
him, struck some faint chord in his feeble
mind. “Eh, Reddy, we’re gettin’ old, we
are,” he said once, sadly, a little bewildered,
like a child. Then almost immediately he
had forgotten, and was happy again, doz-
ing there in the mid-morning warmth.
Twice a week Jason drove his cart, filled
with farm produce for local sale, into the
little town. Sometimes Grandpa went with
him. But not often. Town, with its motor-
cars, its noise of commerce, so hurried and
different from the days ( lie remembered,
frightened him. But he liked the rush and
excitement of getting Jason off.
There had been a big load this morning,
and he had packed and pulled with his
gnarled old hands, tucking in the clean
hessian over the vegetables. He had put
the latest-gathered eggs beside the others
in the sawdust-filled boxes, and he had
screwed down the lids on the glass jars of
cream. These and the pots of golden honey
he had bedded carefully in straw. Then,
as always, he had waited at the gate until
Jason was through, closing it cai'efully be-
fore hd pattered back to the house. He had
washed the breakfast dishes, splashing hap-
pily away, and tidied up the three little
rooms; but even when all this was done it
was still very early, so he went round the
farm, shooing off marauding fowls and
screeching in his thin, quavering voice at an
audacious cow. After that, with every pos-
sibility of his charge exhausted, he had be-
taken himself to the old chair under the
pepper-tree to smoko and watch for Jason’s
return.
Once or twice he dozed off. but he was
wide awake when the cart came in from the
road. He was glad Jason was home. It
was midday, and he was hungry.
Inside he .stoked up the fire. Already the
kettle was boiling gently, and he bustled
about, setting knives and forks and plates
on the deal table in the centre . of tho
kitchen. But he had scarcely begun when
Jason appeared in the doorway.
“Why, yer ain't Jet the mare out that
quick,” said Grandpa reproachfully, as lie
lowered his burden of crockery to the table.
“No, I ain’t. I ain’t goin’ let ’er out,”
answered Jason cryptically. His speech was
slow and lumbering, unlike his swift, vigor-
ous body that must stoop and twist to enter
through the low doorway.
Grandpa’s methods were direct. “Why
ain’t yer goin’ to let ’er out?” he inquired.
“ ’Cos I ain’t. I’m takin’ ’er out agin.”
“Where to?”
“Ter town.” Jason unwrapped parcels
from the store, creasing and folding brown
paper and carefully gathering up the string.
Later, as they sat either side of the table,
he returned to the attack. “Watcher goin’
ter town fer, Jason?” he appealed.
“Well, if yer gotta know, I’m goin’ in ter
fetch someone. I got a visitor cornin' —a
girl.”
Grandpa’s eyes opened wide. Then he
began to giggle, till lie nearly choked in his
withered old throat, and Jason shut down
like an oyster, eating stolidly and in silent
contempt.
Only when he was driving off again did
Jason condescend to speak. “It ain’t none
er yore business,” lie said. “But I gotta
girl. Had ’or a long while now. I’m fetchin’
’er out ’ere ter see the place. While I’m
gone yer might: sprint round an’ tidy up
a bit.”
When he had gone Grandpa went slowly
round to the front of the house. He felt
very tired, and his legs were aching.
The spring air was warm, caressing, and
no winds stirred in the trees. Suddenly the
new blossoms, the young grass, the sight
of a shaky, leggy calf suckling its mother
filled him with a strange sense of loneliness.
Vaguely he tried to grasp it, to analyse it.
But the tired old brain, granite-hard, re-
sisted ; and he was soon cheerful again, busily
preparing for the visitor.
He made a careful toilet. In a kerosene
box under his bed were all the requisites
of a man of fashion. Seldom used now.
and redolent of mothballs, they still retained
their early grandeur. Even a faded carna-
tion, overlooked in the careful putting-away
after the last visit to town, shed its drying-
petals down the lapel of the coat.
Slowly and with difficulty Grandpa sluiced
his face and neck under the tap: then, using
Jason’s brush, he smoothed his stringy white
locks and his sparse beard. Last of all he
put his stiff old limbs into the black suit,
and secured an early cabbage-rose to take
the place of the withered carnation.
When at last the two came round the side
of the house he was pitifully nervous.
“How d’yer do?” he said. ‘‘Pleased ter
meet yer.”
Their self-possession, their pulsating youth,
struck him dumb. He felt shy, uncertain.
“It’s a fine day,” he attempted further.
“I'm glad yer was able ter come.”
“Too right. So'm I,” said the girl, and
she laughed. A full laugh; white throat,
white teeth. She laughed gloriously. She
was a strong creature, lovely in her coarse
health; full-breasted, with firm arms defi-
antly bare. Her cheeks were rich with
blood, sprayed over by crinkly fronds of her
black hair.
Jason —big, silent Jason —watched her all
the time, devoured her with his eyes. He
hardly spoke although she teased him,
laughed at him, chattered incessantly. She
frightened Grandpa, made him feel just a
little ashamed.
“I think the position here is just beautiful,
Mr. Gramb,” she said amiably to Grandpa.
“Don’t you?”
“Yeh,” said Grandpa. How (could lift
tell her of the purple nights, the white
mornings, the mists on the hills, the stretch-
ing infinity of color? What language did
she speak, this young girl?
“Yeh, it’s all right here,” he said. __,
Later they were in the orchard, the girl’s
black head startlingly _ vivid against the
tracery of rose and white, her strong feet
tramping down the grass. Jason, long-
bodied and vigorous, was laughing, too, now
—uneven, excited laughter. At the. gang-
ling calf; at its young, uncertain antics: at
a queer, twisted bough that spurted over
flic creek —at anything, at nothing. Irresis-
tibly their hands met and clenched, and they
laughed at that, with a new note in their
laughter.
“You’ll be shockin’ Mr. Gramb,” said
the girl. “Let go, you great silly! Let
go!” Then she broke away and careered
like a colt undier the spraying, arching-
blossoms till she stumbled at last and Jason
caught her as they both fell headlong in the
lush growth.
“Oh!” she shrieked. “Jason, you great
silly! Mr. Gramb, make him let me up.”
Grandpa watched them gently. It hurt
him inexplicably to see their scrambling,
hurt him to hear their careless shrieks
of laughter. He was glad when Jason told
him awkwardly, the blood pounding darkly
in his face: “We’re goin’ fer a walk. Gramp.
I’m goin’ ter make ’er climb the hill. She’s
too lazy for words.”
Left alone, he just stood there in the
orchard, while Reddy snuffled and nosed
around his feet. For a long time he stood
there, trying to piece it all out. Discontent,
stabbing so strangely all day, filled him now.
“He won’t want me no more,” he said at
last, quaveringly, without any certitude.
“Why should ’e want me when ’e can get
’er? An’ ’e’s got ’er all right.”
Pondering on it. the idea became fixed,
rooted. “I ain’t got no use at all.
Reddy,” he said dully. “Round ’ere
everythin’s young—even the grass, an’ every-
thin’. You ain’t no use. Reddy, neither, you
ain’t. Yer old. Yen teeth's gorn. like mine.
When them two gits married I'll have ter
buzz off, I reckon. She kin do fer ’im
better’n what I could.”
He felt hopeless, infinitely alone, out of
place. He did not cry. He was so old.
he had not many tears. But his sunken
eyeballs ached and stung as he turned to-

McCLARY’S Electric Ranges are most economical in the use

wards the house. It took him a long while
to grope to the chair under the pepper-tree,
and then he sat with his old head, so hope-
fully brushed an hour since, sunken on his
chest. He felt his hands, gnarled and twisted
with age and rheumatism. “What the hell’s
the good er you?” he said bitterly. “She
can carry cups and saucers and pack eggs
better’ll what you can. Yer ain’t no use;
yer old. Yer ain’t got no use. It’s the
young ones what matters. We should ha’
gorn out years back, Reddy, me an’ you.
We ’ung on too long. I reckon I’m nearly
tli’ oldest ’bout ’ere.” He became terrified
at the utter loneliness of his position. “The
oldest ’bout ’ere.”
Slowly the sky crimsoned, and shadows
lengthened, and at last the sun had gone.
Still the two did not return. But Grandpa
had forgotten their absence. He was
brooding, dreaming, and, tired with bitter-
ness, fell into sleep at last.
A touch awoke him. But it was not
the boy and girl. Sim Pratt it was, chiding
him jocosely, and behind him stood old
MacCartliy, the Mayor of the town.
“We were just passing here,” bellowed
Sim jovially, when the old man was fully
awake, “and we thought we’d come in and
fix up a matter of business with you. We
were coming out to-morrow, but to-day is
just as good, eh?”
Grandpa had known Sim since he was in
short trousers.
“Yeh. I'm glad yer come. What did yer
want?” lie said affably, poking at his pipe.
“Good-day, MacCartliy. Jason's around, lie
won’t be long.”
“It wasn’t Jason we wanted ; it was you,
Cramb. It's about this ‘Back to Bunda-
been’ Week we’re having month after next.
You've heard about it, haven't you?”
“Yeh,” said Grandpa. “I heard about it.
Why?”
“Well, you're the town’s oldest identity,
you know, so you will be playing a pretty
big part. We want you on the reception
committee. We want you to be in a sort of
demonstration up at the old mines, too. We
got some others who were here in the gold
rush as well. But what I really wanted to
see you about to-day was the history of
the town we’re getting printed. You know
more about this town than anyone in it.
There’s no one been here as long as you,
and we want you to give us some of your
experiences in the early days.”
“You’ll have to get busy. Cramb. Get
Jason to bring you in one day this week,”
said MacCarthv. “There isn’t another soul
in this town can tell us the things you can.”
Long after they had gone Grandpa sat
there. Vaguely through the gloom he could
see the young blossoms, the new buds. He
could hear the cries of the calf, and through
tlie trees he saw Jason and the girl lustily
emerge.
From a fixed idea he spoke.
“Why. you—there’s hundreds like you.
Thousands. Young, bein’ born, right ’ere
in this town. But there ain’t but one er
me. I know more about this town than
anyone in it. That’s what ’e said. I got
ter give ’em what no one else has got—
experiences—what you ain’t. I bin what you
are, young. But maybe you won’t ever be
what I am, an oldest identity!”
Infinitely wise, infinitely comforted. Grand-
pa hobbled inside to escape the crisp even-
ing air.
VELIA ERCOLE.
His Unfortunate Handicap.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
PAISLEY had mentioned ’it often
enough, but always with such an air
of shame that I had not cared to
probe for what he meant by it. “My un-
fortunate handicap, of course, stands in my
way” seemed to indicate a shortcoming that
was so obvious that it would have been futile
to attempt to screen it. I liked the little
barber at the saloon which had my regular
patronage, seeing nothing wrong in him
excepting, occasionally, an aroma which
awoke suspicion that his unfortunate handi-
cap might be an undue fondness for onions,
and he seemed to be the most popular man
in the place.
Generally Paisley was a cheerful little
soul, but one day when I met him in the
bar at Young and Jackson’s there was a
glumness settled upon his face. He cheered
up, but only slightly, when I invited him to
have a drink, including in the invitation
Withers, who had just come in.
“Taking a holiday?” asked Withers. “I
didn’t see you at the saloon this morning.”
“I’m afraid you won’t see me there any
longer,” he replied with a return of glum-
ness. “I've got the sack.”
“The sack!” exclaimed Withers explosively
and, it struck me, a little blankly. “Why,
how’s that? I always reckoned you the
best bai-ber in the shop.”
“I don’t suppose you need worry much,”
I said. “A man like you should have no
difficulty in getting another job.”
“I don’t know,” lie said gloomily. “A man
like me, with six kiddies, finds it takes all
his money to keep the home going, and he
can’t afford to be out of a job even for
a week. And I might find it difficult to get
another job quickly. In most shops they
don’t want a man with my unfortunate
handicap.”
It may have been the look he saw on my
face at this repetition of his continual griev-
ance that caused him, in a sort of explanatory
manner, to put his hand up, lift his hat
slightly and run liis hand over his head.
“In places where the boss runs a line
of preparations for the hair it’s not likely
that they care about having a inan with—
with my unfortunate handicap,” he said
sadly.
The head he had exposed to view was as
bare as a billiard-ball. I liad always known
that he was bald, but the revelation that
this was the deficiency about which he
had spoken so regretfully, and that I had
all along failed to connect it with his heart’s
sorrow, gave me a sudden inclination to
laugh. I threw a quick look at Withers,
expecting to catch in his face a reflection
of my own mirth ; but there was only there
a look of indignation.
“I’ll never go near that saloon again,” he
said warmly. "I reckon it's a heartless thing
to sack a man with six children just be-
cause he has the misfortune to be bald.”
“You can't blame them altogether,” said
Paisley humbly. “There arc the other bar-
bers telling customers that their hair is
getting thin and advising them to try a
course of Pobblecliick’s liair-restorer, and
there am I, a living advertisement that the
stuff is no good.”
“Why not paint your head with a sign:
‘Before using Pobblechick’s liair-restorer’?”
I suggested with a laugh. “If Joe, with
his curly hair, were to say that his head
was as bald as yours before he started using
it, it would be a good advertisement.”
“It’s no joke,” said Withers indignantly.
“It’s a dastardly thing to throw a man with
six kids out of a job; and there are others
besides me who will feel angry about it.
We regarded this chap as the best assistant
in the shop.”
Then a reason, to which I had never given
a thought previously, occurred to me as the
clue to the popularity of the little hairless
barber. It. came with a vision of the men
who, like Withers, always sought his chair,
and only with great reluctance were deflected
to another Rogers, Cayley, Morton and
a lot more. All of them, like Withers
himself, showed large patches of naked head.
The humor of the vision and its revelation
absorbed me, and I only caught Withers
half-way through the explanation of an idea
which sent the little barber away with his
usual chirpy spirit restored, and an appoint-
ment. made to meet Withers on the follow-
ing day.
Because of a liking for the little barber,
and a sympathy for him in his anxiety for
his children, I readily bound myself to give
support to the scheme Withers propounded ;
and amongst the baldheads it was taken up
with genuine enthusiasm. Withers happened
to know a tobacconist who had no saloon
attached to his shop, and ample room at the
back to establish one; and he listened to
an influential deputation of regular customers
who suggested that a saloon was wanted, and
gave guarantees of support. Once mooted,
the scheme moved quickly to fruition, and
within a few days the little barber was
installed in a saloon of his own.
“I have to consider myself fortunate —
with my unfortunate handicap,” he said as
he shaved me for the first time in the new
premises. “And I owe it all to the kind-
ness of you gentlemen. I hope to be able
to show my gratitude some day. I’ve got a
secret, but it’s no good talking of it yet.”
I glanced around as I left the chair. Three
men were waiting their turns, and each one
of them was more or less inclined to bald-
ness. On my next visit the place was filled
with tobaceo-smoke, baldheaded customers and
an air of placid contentment. The situation
was amusing. The news of the existence of a
barber whose own deficiency left him help-
less to make remarks about his customers"
cranial shortcomings seemed to have spread
amongst the bald-headed; the little barber
assured me that he was doing splendidly, and
that he was looking for a baldheaded assist-
ant to help him in the rapidly-growing
business. “A man like me naturally has a
feeling that lie would like to help others
who may suffer from the same unfortunate
handicap,” he confided.
It had never occurred to me before that
the hairless were so sensitive about their
lack of locks, but I saw' in the rapid popu
larity of the little barber the relief they had
in getting away from men who constantly
reminded them about it and urged them to
combat a condition with which, but for such
irritating reminders, they would be contented
enough. •
To escape the annoyance they were satis-
fied to undergo the waiting which was in
evitable, even when an assistant almost as
bald as the little barber himself arrived
Having no such reason for seeking this sane
tuary, however, the waiting became irritating
to me, and at length, feeling that the little
barber was well established without my sup-
port, I went.wdiere I could get more prompt
attention.
It was- on meeting Withers many months
later that I remembered how he had
established the little barber, and I inquired
after him.
“A man doesn’t expect any gratitude in
this world,” lie said shortly. “Paisley’s a
fool —a man who couldn’t leave well alone.”
“Why, what’s wrong with him?” I asked.
“What’s he been doing?”
“Oh, he’s all right, I suppose,” Withers
said. “He’s doing very well, I believe; but
I haven’t been there for some time.”
When I called into the saloon a few days
later I had the luck to get a chair imme-
diately. It struck me that an air of unusual
prosperity gave Paisley, who greeted me with
cheerful cordiality, an aspect which was in
some way strange.
“Your hair seems to be growing as strongly
as ever,” he said, with something like regret
in his voice. “It’s not necessary for inc
to dq. anything for you; but I’ve got a liair-
restorer of my own now, the value of which
I’ve proved myself. See what it has done
to me.”
There was an absurd pride in his voice
which drew my attention to his head and
the cause of the strangeness in him which
had struck me. Over that expanse of shin-
ing bareness which had once been his “un-
fortunate handicap” a soft down had made
its appearance, a young crop making, ap-
parently, a great struggle for existence. As
liair it was infantile as yet; but there it
was, giving promise of a future.
Then I knew the reason for . the petu-
lance of Withers the man who, having
escaped from a daily annoyance, found it
returned to him by a man who regarded
hair as one of life’s most desirable posses-
sions. The knowledge reminded me of an-
other change which had struck me. but
which I had scarcely noticed. The assistant
now helping P ( aisley was Joe, his curly-haired
colleague in the other saloon.
“You’ve lost the other man you had here
at the start?” I said.
“Yes; I had to send him away. I gave
him a trial for as long as I could,” he said,
and then dropped his voice into a confidential
whisper. “Somehow or other my hair-
restorer, good as you see it is, had no effect
at all upon his head.”
