conversant with all their peculiarities. I am prepared,
therefore, to
Guaranies a Permanent ad Complete Cure iu every case I undertake.

DR. KELLY'S REPUTATION IS SO THOROUGHLY ESTABLISHED THAT IT WILL
ONLY BE NECESSARY FOR HIM TO INTIMATE THAT HE IS PRACTISING AS A
SPECIALIST TO BE APPRECIATED AS A BENEFACTOR TO SUFFERING MANKIND. AS
THE GREATER PORTION OP THE NEW SOUTH WALES PUBLIC IS AWARE, DR. KELLY
IS A LEGALLY QUALIFIED AND REGISTERED PHYSICIAN, AND HAS BY FAR THE
LARGEST PRACTICE IN THE COLONIES. MANY PERSONS AT A DISTANCE, HOWEVER,
ARB UNAWARE OF HIS GREAT SUCCESS, AS, HITHERTO, HE HAS REFRAINED FROM
ADVERTISING. HENCE, TO WIDEN THE SPHERE OP HIS USEFULNESS, HE HAS
DETERMINED, BY MEANS OP ADVERTISING, TO MAKE HIMSELF KNOWN IN REMOTE
DISTRICTS WHERE HIS REPUTATION MAY NOT YET HAVE TRAVELLED. AS THE
QUESTION MAY ARISE, WHY DOES SO EMINENT A PHYSICIAN AS DR. KELLY FIND
IT NECESSARY TO ADVERTISE, HE MAY REPLY TO ONE AND ALL AS FOLLOWS
IP THERE IS A PERSON ON EARTH TO BE PITIED IT IS HE WHO IS OBLIGED
TO ASSOCIATE WITH HIS FELLOW BEINGS WHILE HIS MIND IS CONSTANTLY
HARASSED AND TORTURED BY THE CONSCIOUSNESS OP
WHAT MUST INEVITABLY FOLLOW.
HE LOOKS HAGGARD AND SHEEPISH. HE IS NERVOUS IN PUBLIC, AND EXTREMELY
GIRLISH AND BACKWARD IN LADIES’ SOCIETY. THE VICTIM OP THIS, THE MOST
DANGEROUS OP ALL VICES, IP NOT RELIEVED, SOON REACHES A STATE WHICH MUST
END IN LIFE-LONG MISERY. HE MUST ULTIMATELY SINK TO THE LOWEST STAGE
OP DEGRADATION AND SHAME. DR. KELLY MAINTAINS THAT THE PHYSICIAN WHO
HAS THE POWER TO CURE, AND REMAINS SILENT, IS GUILTY OF AN UNPARDONABLE
SIN OP OMISSION. PERSONS WHO READ HIS GREAT WORK ON THIS SUBJECT WILL
BE SHOWN THE INEVITABLE RESULT OP THE BAD HABITS, AND IN MOST
INSTANCES SUFFICIENTLY EARLY IN LIFE TO ENABLE THEM
TO SEE THEIR FOLLY
BEFORE ANY DISEASE HAS TAKEN POSSESSION OP THEM. THE BOOK WILL ALSO
SHOW THEM CLEARLY
HOW TO CURE THE DISEASE WITHOUT
THE ASSISTANCE OF PHYSICIAN OR CHEMIST.
MANY PERSONS WONDER WHY THEIR MEMORY IS NOT SO RETENTIVE, AND THEIR
GENERAL INTELLECT NOT SO CLEAR AND STRONG AS THEY FORMERLY WERE.
DR KELLY’S BOOK WILL EXPLAIN THE CAUSE IN PLAIN AND SIMPLE LANGUAGE.
THEREFORE. EVEN THOUGH YOU BE FREE PROM DISEASE, SEND FOR THIS GREAT
MEDICAL WORK, THAT YOU MAY BE ENABLED TO ADVISE OTHERS AFTER PERUSING
ITS PAGES. VERY FREQUENTLY THIS MAY BE DONE BEFORE ANY GREAT HARM
HAS TAKEN PLACE.
SEE HIS PALE AND SALLOW FACE, UPON WHICH
DISEASE HAS LEFT ITS MARKS.
AMONG WHICH ARE
ACNE (FLESH WORMS), PIMPLES (ESPECIALLY ON THE FOREHEAD),
DARK CIRCLES ROUND THE EYES, SLUGGISH PUPILS, AND EYES
WITHOUT LUSTRE, HE HAS A HAGGARD, TROUBLED LOOK, HIS
MANNER IS ECCENTRIC, LISTLESS, SHY AND EASILY CONFUSED,
HIS MOVEMENTS ARE SHUFFLING AND UNCERTAIN, AND
BETRAY A MIND ILL AT EASE, HIS MENTAL OPERATIONS ARE
ERRATIC, HE IS EMBARRASSED, AWKWARD, AND ACTS WITHOUT
ANY FIXED PURPOSE, HE IS ABSENT-MINDED, AND GIVEN TO
REVERIE AND DESPONDENCY.
IF 1 YOU ARE DOUBTFUL AS TO WHETHER YOU REQUIRE MEDICAL ASSISTANCE,
YOU SHOULD WRITE TO THE DOCTOR WITHOUT DELAY.

Ananias, the Auditor.
The few remaining “ land-banks ” of Australia
—the straggling survivors of the great financial
storm—are still bursting one by one, and of
these institutions there will presently be none
remaining. The boasted “revival of public
confidence,” so glibly foretold by the daily
press, never comes, and in any case no amount
of confidence can prop up an establishment
which lives by borrowing money at 10 per cent,
and lending it out again at eight; The banks
that are gone are now being overhauled by the
bankruptcy officials, and they all exhibit a
great and horrible discrepancy between the
balance-sheet and the reality ; and the banks
that are not gone, but are only going, keep on
issuing more balance-sheets, many of which will
probably excite public derision in times to
come, when the capital is missing, and the
reserve-fund is non est, and the securities are
brown paper, and there are no assets save air
and utter emptiness. All these balance-sheets
are “ carefully audited ” by more or less reput-
able accountants, with the same invariable
result. Even the week before the great ex-
plosion the auditor always guarantees that
everything is perfectly correct; and though the
alleged securities are only dead men’s I O U’s
he testifies that he has gone through them and
found that the capital is safely and prudently
invested, and when the alleged available cash is
£lO,OOO and the visible funds are only 4s. 2d. and
an obliterated postage-stamp, he issues a signed
statement that he has checked the said balance
and that everything is absolutely without flaw.
Also, the books may bo all hopeless and
unutterable chaos, but lie always compliments
the management on the scrupulous accuracy
displayed, and, strangely enough, the public
■4 ill believe in audits, and never seem to realise
that the auditor and the Ttch hokne claimant
and the great sea-serpent are all built on the
tame plan.
[here is absolutely no balance-sheet on the
face of the financial earth to which hundreds of
auditors will not certify—provided they receive
their fee—without the slightest question. The
accounts of the City of Glasgow Bank were
duly inspected for some twelve or fifteen years
nf utter rottenness, and always “found to be
trictly accurate. The Bank of Van Diemen’s
Land was-audited.in. like manner. So was the
Northumberland (N.S.W.) Banking Company,
which was attested as being in a- highly pros-
perous state until it dried up Ifke'a vision. ‘So
was that other bank which recently failed to
discover that its manager had allowed himself
an unsecured overdraft of something over
£lOO,OOO. Matthias Lakkin was audited for
many years without arousing the slightest sus-
picion. Every swindle—every glaring fraud
which lives upon the public in any part of the
world—is duly and scientifically audited ; and
so long as the swindle is perpetrated by the
directors or proprietors of the institution—that
is to say, by those who hire the auditor—
the report always announces that things are in
a condition which exceeds the brightest hopes
of everybody concerned. Among all the bubbles
that have burst in recent times, there is—so far
as we are aware—not one case in which the
blind and deranged supervisor of accounts did
the slightest service in protecting the interests
of the shareholders or the outside public.
Judging from results, there seems to be every
reason to believe that Ananias was an auditor.
The position occupied by this functionary is
-curious and anomalous. In the first place,
there is no guarantee whatsoever that he knows
anything of accounts. Anybody who can hire
an office and get credit for a brass plate is an
auditor, and he may even get through without
the office and the brass plate. He may be an
ex-mud-carter, or a person who shovelled dirt,
or a bricklayer; if it is the interest of his
employers to engage a man who is absolutely
certain never to notice a discrepancy, the
chances are that he is one of these. His busi-
ness is, above all things, to detect frauds perpe-
trated by the managers and directors at the
expense of the shareholders. Yet, in most
cases, he is appointed by the same managers
and directors whom he is supposed to view with
an all-seeing and hostile eye—-their personal
voting power and that of their friends and
proxies being generally sufficient to outvote the
handful of shareholders who roll up at the
annual meeting. He is nominated, directly or
indirectly, by them, either because he is weak
and spineless, or is unscrupulous and open to
bribery, or is utterly ignorant and incompetent,
or, again, because he is too poor to risk losing
his miserable salary by making unpleasant dis-
coveries. He understands that he is appointed
expressly for the purpose of not finding out
anything, and that he will hold his place only
so long as he shows no signs of finding out any-
thing, and he finds out nothing accordingly. If
the detectives were appointed by the votes of
the criminal classes, and when they interrupted
a burglar were liable to be dismissed by that
burglar there and then, it would exactly repre-
sent the situation. The auditor is a spy and a
detective whose great business it is (or ought to
be) to run down the fraudulent 1 director, but as
the director virtually appoints his own detective
he naturally selects one who, he is quite sure,
will never cause him the slightest inconvenience.
Hie one constant and reliable feature about
the general public is that it can’t even
audit its own wash-bill. It is guiltless of arith-
metic and even of ordinary horse-sense.
When a company offers to borrow money from
the harmless, necessary depositor at ten per
cent., and lend it out again at eight, it is a
hundred chances to one that it never notices the
awful anomaly. It will believe in any kind of
balance-sheet that is placed before it, except in
times of general panic, and then it believes in
nothing at all; but, whether it believes or dis-
believes, the document is as unintelligible to it
as an Assyrian inscription is to a goat. We
have before us, at the present moment, a
balance-sheet issued by a well-advertised
financial institution, in which the gross amount
of a debt and a certain sum paid in reduction
of that debt are added together, so that, on
paper at least, the item grows by being
reduced ; this publication is duly attested
by the usual alleged accountant, and so far no
one appears to have noticed the difference. In
view of this general public stupidity, the
auditor is the only possible safeguard of the
shareholders, and, though the auditor wrecks
, them every time, their child-like faith in him
never seems to diminish. Every day he guar-
antees packets of wrapping-paper as being
valuable securities, and takes his useless
affidavit that he has seen and counted the cash
that doesn’t exist, and swears that the
absconded swindler’s P.N., or the corpse’s
unsecured overdraft, is a solid asset; and though
he thereby gets his salary under false pretences
and becomes part and parcel of a villainous
fraud, lie never seems to get into gaol as a con-
sequence. He is arrested occasionally, and
then he is bailed out, and next he is acquitted
as being the victim of undeserved misfortune,
and that is all.
There is no evil, excepting death, that is
absolutely without a remedy. In the first
place, the auditor, like the lawyer and the
physician, should be a licensed officer, who has
proved by examination before a competent
board his fitness fot his work, and an absolutely
and hopelessly ignorant member of the profes-
sion should be made an impossibility. It is
still possible to find a licensed attorney or
doctor who knows exceedingly little, but to
find one who knows absolutely nothing is a
matter of difficulty, and the auditor could at
least be elevated to the same sufficiently mean
standard. The law, of course, cannot forbid
a man to die without a doctor, if he absolutely
insists on doing so, nor does it prevent a man
being hanged without a lawyer ; and in like
manner any company or partnership may go to
financial ruin without calling in an expert to
supervise its accounts if it feels that way ; but
so long as a body of shareholders pay and rely
upon an auditor the State can, at all events,
give some assurance that they will get the
individual they pay for. And, in the second
place, the auditor of every company should be
appointed by the personal suffrages of the
shareholders assembled in general meeting, no
directors being allowed to vote. Such an
arrangement is absolutely necessary, seeing that
the chief business of this particular official is to
keep a strict watch upon the directors. He
exists on the well-founded assumption that the
board and the manager and the clerical staff
are a joint public conspiracy to be continually
guarded against. He is, in short, a hired
detective and spy, and if he is entirely depen-
dent for his appointment on the very enemy he
is supposed to watch with a sleepless eye his
supervision is necessarily a mockery. And,
having accepted his position, he should be held
civilly and criminally responsible for the due
performance of his duties. He practically
undertakes to prevent, or to promptly detect,
frauds ; if he is incapable of doing it then he
has obtained his salary under false pretences
and should bo treated accordingly ; if he
is capable of doing it and does not do
it, then he should be prosecuted for criminal
negligence or for wilful dishonesty as circum-
stances direct. The position is a strictly
logical one. The man who undertakes to
supervise a steamship or a locomotive is
held responsible if the steamship is wrecked or
the locomotive is shattered either through his
carelessness or his ignorance, and the fact that
he did not wilfully run his engine or his vessel
to destruction is not regarded as any sufficient
excuse. The man who undertakes to supervise
a financial institution suffers no hardship if he
i s treated on an exactly similar principle.
ihe auditor, in short, should be the profes-
sional foe of the director—the hired blood-
hound who is for ever on his track. The
only reason for his existence is the assumption
that directors are not honest and reliable, and
he should treat them accordingly. The chronic
explanation, whenever some big institution
crumbles unexpectedly away and all its assets
vanish like a baseless assumption in the dark, is
that he “accepted the assurances” of some-
body, and in a general way the auditor who
accepts the assurances of anybody should be
put in gaol. Over and over again the story is
told of how he passed the title-deeds of some
utterly useless swamp as being valuable pro-
perty because he was told to do so—-of how he
accepted a bundle of sham parchments as
genuine securities—of how he passed a bogus
bank-book, without comparison with the bank
ledgers, or assumed a dead creditor to be alive
and solvent, or guaranteed the cash which he
never counted, or took it for granted that an
empty safe was full of valuable assets. Yet his
business is to assume, as a general principle,
that the manager and the directors and the
entire staff are lying in every particular, and he
has no more right to accept their statements
without absolute verification than the police-
man has to believe the unsupported assurances
of the burglar whom he interrupts when he is
making off with his “swag.” Moreover, the
auditor who accepts favours from any board of
directors with whom he has business relations
should be as promptly discharged and disquali-
fied as the Judge who is convicted of taking
gratuities from the Chifiese fan-tan expert;
the act may be perfectly innocent in either
case, but the probabilities against it being so
are altogether too numerous. And, finally,
the accountant who devotes himself to this
branch of business should be paid at a
rate which is commensurate with his re-
sponsibilities. Under present conditions any
cheap ignoramus will fill the bill, and, as a
natural consequence, the remuneration is care-
fully adjusted to correspond with the probable
uselessness of the person who receives it. There
are few good auditors, because it is more profit-
able to be a bad one. The skilled accountant,
if he performs his duty conscientiously, devotes
to it an amount of time and labour which is
absolutely ruinous. Then, as the result of this
waste of energy, he finds out discrepancies, and
is either “sacked at once for finding them out,
or else he gains an unenviable reputation which
leads to his being quietly shunted at the next
election of officers. The model auditor is the
man who never asks unpleasant questions, and
who drinks comfortably with the board.
The Question of Equality.
Whenever the well-fed holder of much of this
world’s wealth wishes to absolutely crush and
logically pulverise his socialistic or democratic
opponent, like the Christians who put their
failings on the Devil’s back, he throws all the
responsibility of the short-comings of the exist-
ing condition of things upon the shoulders of a
much-abused myth which he calls Nature.
This lady, whom he pictures as a sort of cruel
fairy godmother, is supposed to live somewhere
within the bowels of the earth, ttfh'jhg most of
the time upon the necessity of gjypg forth to
kill something, and filling in her leis Ul<3
moments making cyclones and tidal-waves
crocodiles and monopolists, and various other
pests, to serve her as missionaries of death and
destruction. “Survival of the fittest” i s a
stock phrase with the average objector who
values “fitness” at bank-hates and measures
manhood by acreage ; but he loses sight entirely
of the fact that finality is the only test anph-
cable to the conditions, and that the survivor
may, in all probability, be nothing more import-
ant than the infinitesimal life-germ that eats
away the iron-rails of locomotive tracks or
throngs the tiny pores of the granite of which
men fashion basement-stones for financial insti-
tutions.
* * *
The man who owns money and land, and is
generally prosperous, is, however, not often con-
sistently logical. One such wiseacre writing in
the S.M. Herald the other day, first made an
assertion to the effect that all men could not
expect equal rights because Nature did not
make all men equal. He afterwards remarked
that if a man does not succeed in making a
fortune, he has only himself to thank for it.
Now one of these statements contradicts the
other, because if a man has to thank Nature
for making him what he is, it is manifestly
absurd of him to waste valuable energy in
thanking himself. The writer, who writes over
the subscription of “One of the People ”~he
should have added “ who are well to do”—
advocates the maintenance of the injustices
inflicted by birth, heredity and environment
upon the physically, mentally and socially
handicapped, and considers that when he has
proved that one man comes into the world
with greater strength or greater brain-power
than the average, that "he should there-
fore, by natural right, annex everything
that he can lay his hands on that makes
life worth living. This argument, if logi-
cally extended, would mean the absolute
subversion of all government, for it is simply a
plea for the annihilation of every barrier raised
by humanity between the oppressed and the
oppressor, and for an unqualified return
to a state of savagery, in which the battle
between the weak and the strong would be ever
decided by the rules that obtained in the
gladiatorial arena of old Rome.
# •!>.
Men are not born equal; but the institution
of the State is in itself an avowed effort to
lessen the horrors of inequality as much as
is possible, and any State is advanced and pro-
gressive in proportion as the strength of the
strong and the cunning of the canny are levelled
down to the weakness of the weak and the
simplicity of the simple. Otherwise, the best
possible of all governments would be a competi-
tive tyranny in which the spoils would he to
the most ruthless and the most brutal and un-
scrupulous among men. What a hideous
thing would be a tyranny of genius, with
successive Julius Caesars or Napoleon Bona-
partes crushing out the life and energy of
States, and dissipating the manhood of nations
in wars subserving only their own ambitious
ends ! Fortunately for humanity, the genius is
ordinarily succeeded by the fool, and the
exhausted community has a chance of recovering
somewhat of its misused vigour, and of again
breasting up to the standard set by its too
energetic masters of a preceding generation,
io say that the mere possession of extraordi-
nary ability to acquire, constitutes a right (in
the moral sense) to override the rights of those
less able to do so, is simply to give the denial to
all the ideals of humanity, which for at least
eighteen centuries has found the highest
expression of its perfected manhood in the per-
sonality of one to whom the moral right was
paramount. Craft, and not merit, seizes most
of the material rewards of life, and this
modern deification of mere monetary suc-
cess is the excuse which the system of
Free Competition lays hold of to justify
its existence. But it is a sheer evasion
of the question to consider every ■wealthy man
as the creator of his own wealth, and entitled
therefore to all the rewards that should attend
on merit. An enormous percentage of such
wealth has been inherited by men totally incap-
able of earning by themselves even an average
livelihood, and it has been augmented and kept
continuously increasing by means of a system
of social mechanism that no one man in the
world could possibly contrive.
Putting aside, however, all consideration of
the means by which wealtli has been acquired,
together with the questions involved by an
assessment of priority or equality of opportuni-
ties, the issue is a very simple one, and it is
this : should men hold political power in pro-
portion to their incomes or not ? If it is granted
that a house entitles a man to a vote, over and
above the vote he holds as a man, then two
houses should logically entitle him to two votes,
and a thousand houses, or equivalent money-
value, to a thousand votes, and so on, until Jay
Could or Baron Rothschild is arrived at,
ruling a nation by virtue of a voting-power
based solely on the “ rights ” of Property-
Plural - voting and the “ reward of thrift”
logically means this, or it means nothing-
But the argument extends further than
this. If the possession of property means
moral right carrying political power, if
inequality among men is one of Nature’s most
sacred laws, intended to be upheld and observed
by humanity at any cost, at any surrender of
ethical ideals, then re-establish feudality with
its chattel serfs, and give once more to the most
masterful and brutal the thousand and one per-
sonal claims of the lord over his creature. But we
know that such a proposition would be indignantly
scouted by the very men who now ignorantly
claim political power for mere inanimate matter,
and who believe that they arc assisting Nature
in her intentions by attempting the annihilation
of every social regulation or legislative enact-
ment by which men have sought to mitigate
the ferocity of mere natural law. It is nob
enough to attempt to justify any existing con-

V o w, under a democratic government, moral
■Jlit is as much recognised as the laws of
demand and supply. The democratic govern-
nt is an amplification of the ideal of the
family- lt‘ s function is the care of all its
children, so that no one shall have undue
advantage over another. To favour the wealthy,
the prosperous, the thrifty, the inheritors of
certain instincts which alone are sufficient to
protect them against the competition of those
pot similarly endowed, is to handicap in the
same proportion the poor, the needy, and
the unfortunate. Every crumb piled upon
the plate of him who hath is a crumb
stolen from the mouth of Lazarus. The
true mother protects the weakest of her off-
spring against the aggressions of the rest. The
ideal State is that one in which the possession
of mere life is the sole claim to any right of any
kind, political or social. No Protectionist
Government in the world logically dare give
the wealthy man more political power than the
poor man, because Protection is the recognition
of the fact that Nature is partial. Some States
are too powerful to treat with commercially,
and Protection, recognising this, steps in to
adjust the balance and to guard the weak
against the encroachments of the strong.
Instead of any increase in political power as a
reward for the conservation of wealth, Demo-
cracy demands absorption by the State of that
wealth in order that political power shall not
accrete in the hands of the few, and govern-
ment thus become the rule of a caste or a
section over the entire community. In other
words, Democracy is a political machine for
correcting the inequalities attributed to Natural
Order.
“Influenza has caused a fall in colonial
securities”—by reason, it is said, of British
insurance companies, which were large holders
of Australian debentures, being compelled to
realise on those securities, in order to meet
claims falling suddenly due in excess of the
average death expectancies. There is probably
a lot of bogus exchange trickery in this bearing
down the market, but it nevertheless indicates
a point of caution to insurance actuaries who
are wont to calculate problematical chances
with an assured certainty that leaves only a
narrow margin for sudden wholesale death
contingencies. In a young country like Aus-
tralia, whose population is continually being
increased by young and healthy lives,
and whose proportion of old people nearing the
inevitable is much smaller than in old-world
countries, the past and present death-rate has
been, and is, necessarily low. But even with-
out the occurrence of a destructive plague or
other calamity, there must come a time in the
future when the older assurances will fall in by
larger groups, and the death-rate will steadily
rise as the years progress, until a new minimum
and a new maximum average are established.
It is with these considerations in view that the
progress reports and actuarial statistics of even
the largest Australian life-assurance companies
should be studied.

Eight years ago (then as now) Premie r
Griffith (of Queensland) swore by the Dutton
band Act, which aimed at shutting down on
land alienation; now, MTlwraith has con-
verted him to widespread land-sales in order
to fill the Treasury. Then Griffith success-
fully opposed land-grant railways, dear to the
speculative heart of Mac.; now, Sir Sam. is
understood to be willing to experiment with the
evil thing. Then, also, Griffith denounced
the kanaka trade as a creation of Satan’s ;
now, he is wavering under the domination of
his porpoise colleague, whom he was wont
to liken to the very Mephistopheles himself !
MTlwraith used to assert that Griffith had
not only attacked him as a politician, but had
assailed his personal honour in a manner that
would have branded him as a felon. Griffith
never publicly apologised, as did the late Billy
Miles and Mac’s other detractors, and Mac
swore he would never recognise Griffith “ as a

Morehead, whom he now hates like poison,
and lo ! the present iniquitous Coalition. Sir

Liberal policy remains. As for MTlwraith’S

The House of Living Death.
(FOR THE BULLETIN.)
Twenty-two miles from Sydney, planted
in the centre of a desolate landscape, close by the
roar of a railway-line, clothed in a harmony of
misery, stands the N.S.W. House of Living
Death, the Liverpool Poor Asylum. There, the
worms fatten faster; there, exists a Purgatory
visible to human eyes. There, year in and year out,
an average of 300 living corpses gasp out their
last; never is there cessation in the stream of
recruits. Cosmopolitan is its constituency, the
nations of the whole world discharge their refuse
into this Golgotha. Even the chill Esquimaux
may yet hope to warm his frost-bitten fingers
at its kitchen fires. His is almost the only
nationality now unrepresented there.
# * *
More than a third of the Asylum’s inmates
are Irishmen; scarce a score are Australian
natives. The played-out scion of a “noble” family,
flung as waste on our shores, is there, props his
wasted body against the same walls as does many
a hardy pioneer who has done Australia good ser-
vice, and has failed grandly in life’s combat.
Many a riddled and heroic fool, who has taken
“ the Queen’s shilling ”to be made a target of, has
sighed out his last breath in this haven of per-
ishing cripples. Past professional and business-
men, ex-clergymen and university graduates croon
out their days with poor devils, foredoomed
failures, who never had among them all one
solitary chance to taste of life’s higher pleasures.
And there, right in the hand-clasp of “ the great
leveller ” is that hateful horror - , Caste.
The dying aristocratic pauper in Bed 1 won’t
speak to the expiring pauper workman in Bed 2,
though they may both be clutched in the Un-
known’s grasp at the same second. A consump-
tive, almost at his last whiff of respiration, boasted
that he “ never spoke to the other patients ; I’m a
gentleman born, you know.” And his hollow,
hectic cheeks seemed to puff themselves out with
the “pride of birth,” while his startlingly piercing
eyes, even though they saw the shape of the All-
gatherer stalking towards him, flashed with scorn
of his mates. Is there aught that can kill human
hatreds while class-rule holds the world ?
Three hundred and fifty of these mixed paralytics
lie bedridden in the overcrowded hospitals of the
asylum ; the others totter around in various stages
of heart-disease and hopeless infirmities. A few—
a very few—are “ shamming Abraham.” “ What
is the matter with” (let us say) “the Colonel?”
Quoth tiro respondent official, “Sloth.”
"About three-fourths of the inmates are deaf,
blind, maimed, or palsied. Some are all four.
There is not one quite deaf, and not a dumb man
at all. Bachelors preponderate over married men.
There are numbers of Norwegian phthisical
patients.

The ages of the men range from 22 to 105.
The tallest man there is the oldest and one of the
strongest—old Daddy Brown, 105 years old, a
pensioner in receipt of 15d. per day from Her
Gracious Majesty, because he failed to get mur-
dered during 171 years of naval service, is 6ft. 3in.
in his socks, and 15 stone in weight. A little
while ago—only 90 years —Brown commenced the
vicious habit of smokin§. At the age of 12 years
he started feasting on o.p. ship’s rum, and hardly
a day since he came to Australia has he missed
taking a morning pint of similar snakejuice.
Cursed drink and vile tobacco have marked him
for their own and written premature decay on his
furrowed brow, and now, at the early age of 105
years, he is not expected to live more than another
score or so. It is deplorable to see such a man
wrecked by vice.
The pigmy of the Asylum is 4ft. 4in. high, and
is a renowned teetotaller.
This paper does not intend to enquire into the
religions of the patients; they probably mostly
would “take whisky in their tay,” if permitted.
Grog, however, is not permitted inside the insti-
tution, except in cases of the most urgent
necessity.
It is not unfair to mention that the Asylum
contains at least one Agnostic—the Librarian, an
omnivorous reader. His is a case of severe physical
injury, but he is happy inside his little den, where
he rules 1600 volumes, of which 300 are always
out on loan. The run is on novels, and theology
is a neglected sport. Scientists are, by depart-
mental decree, proscribed authors. In the Libra-
rian’s private collection, however, are to be
found Spencer, Huxley, Tyndal, Darwin, Brad-
laugh, Annie Besant, Tom Paine, Ingersoll,
Renan, &c.
Perhaps the 20 or so Salvationists would feel
hurt if this article neglected to advertise them.
Their boss got his conversion as suddenly as St.
Paul, and, like St. Paul, by a scare. He was a
bullock-puncher, and one morning the new leader,
just after being yoked up, viciously drove its left
horn between the man’s leather belt and his body,
and in the result dislocated his ankle and gored
his back. Being thus reminded of the Devil’s
horns and guessing at what these might be like,
he repented and reformed.
Another Salvationist received 4d. per day for
a billet he fills. He saved up, invested in a race-
sweep ticket, and joyfully raked in <£B 14s.
Hallelujah !

Talking of sacred luxuries, 13s. fid. is a
clergyman’s fee for reading the burial-service over
a defunct Liverpudlian. The Catholics don’t die
hurriedly. Seeing a coffin being wheeled on a barrow
towards the small stone morgue, a Roman Catholic
priest cried out—“ Doothor, there goes another
body for the English clergyman—that’s his
fifteenth to my third.”
“ It’s the body you want, then?” retorted the
doctor, with brisk vivacity ; “ I thought you only
cared about a man’s soul. Well, are you going to
offer roe a commission ?”
One clergymen raked in for the last quarter of
’9l, for these mournful services, =£23.
Cardinal Moran recently minuted the visitors-
bouk to the effect that a chapel should be erected
for the Roman Catholic inmates; also, that the
hospitals were overcrowded. Why didn’t his
Eminence also ask for another hospital ?
That the hospitals arc overcrowded is patent to
the most Unobservant visitor. For a poor wretch
to die on the floor is not uncommon. The largest
dormitory holds 75 beds.
# * *
Dr. Beattie, the superintendent, is a big,
robust, kindly man, and appears to fit his position
perfectly. The patients delight ill Ills cheery
animation, though he himself on one occasion
gave himself quite an opposite certificate of
character.
“ How many hypochondriacs are there among
the patients, doctor?”
“ We are steadily populating Paradise with
them. There are scores of them here. I’m one
myself. I’ve got bronchitis this morning. If you
go into the morgue, you’ll see the coffin I selected
for myself long ago. It’s the one with the red
mark on it. Coffins are supplied here by the
dozen at Bs. apiece, so I don’t see why I shouldn’t
get a cheap one.”
Dr. Beattie was the head medico at Quarantine
Station during the Sydney smallpox panic, years
ago. One of his present patients was coadjutor
grave-digger there. On one occasion, when a
smallpox patient died, the doctor, in the absence
of anyone else, volunteered to read the burial-
service. It was night, and such a night! When
the procession started for the grave, a thunder-
storm was raging at its highest. A disinfected
policeman, carrying a lantern, took the lead; two
rum-infected gravediggers, humping the body with
muttered hiccoughs of blasphemy, followed.
Beattie brought up the rear, stumbling and falling
through tangled grass-tree unevens; torrents of
rain drenched the odoriferous rumholders and
bobby, and lightning played a ghastly illumina-
tion commentary, while the thunder boomed its
dread minute-guns. Fifty yards from the grave
the policeman fell and broke the lantern, and the
rest of the misery had to be seen through
lightning flashes and by lighting matches. Reach-
ing the grave, the alcoholised bearers flung in the
body and cleared back cursing. Then the doctor,
while the policeman steadied himself against his
sober form, lit matches, and holding his hat over
the Prayer-book read the burial-service conscien-
tiously through.
#« * *
Of course, the patients all know Pavkes.
When he visited the Asylum last he promised to
have a balcony added for the use of consumptive
patients. Another unfulfilled promise, that's all.
The Asylum grows its own vegetables. Lately,
a farm of 1200 acres has been started at Glenfield,
under Captain Webber, once of the ill-fated
Ly-ee-Moon. Cows are to be sent there to grow
milk that is to outrival that of the contractors.
Three-fourths of the inmates have not an outside
friend in the world, and never receive a letter.
They may rejoice that they are consequently
never dunned, nor need to thank heaven that
-there is an editorial w.p.b. The sight of no old
friend’s face cheers their last flicker ; the grasp of
a mate’s hand is to many of them a memory far
back in the faded years —20, 30, 40 years. _ The
average number of visitors is two per diem, in the
proportion of three women to two men. Alone, a
member of Parliament visits the Asylum about
once in five years ; otherwise, only when there is
a “function” and a feed. Once a month about
20 of the lucky ones are allowed to visit their
friends.
On the average, 12 letters a day leave the
Asylum, and about six are received. Out of the
800, few received Christmas tokens last Christmas-
tide, and the mail-bag had no extra bulge. One
favoured patient did certainly receive a beauty—
baby faces and flowers, with the lines
Mockery of contrast : he was a once famous Mel-
bourne detective, and “ Paralysis,’' said the
doctor, “ he’ll be dead in a few days.” That was
weeks ago.-
R.I.P.
Several patients receive between them all the
Sydney papers, while three actually contribute to
the Sydney dailies. We thought we recognised
their style in the leaders. The comely matron
declares that she gets all the country news
through the inmatek.
About six entertainments per year are got up in
the dining-hall, and of these Dr. Beattie, elocu-
tionist and all-round amateur, is naturally the
mainstay—if we except the Blind Asylum Band.
The men who scrub, or wash, or cook, &c., get
two figs of tobacco per week, but others who
cobble or work as tailors earn as much as from
2d. to 6d. per week. The Asylum makes all its
own clothes. Only two or three priyate indi-
viduals are paid for as guests; one is an old
barrister.
Lord Jersey’s last minute in the visitors-book
declares that “all the arrangements appear well
adapted for the comfort and happiness of the
inmates. Everything was in perfect order.”
* * *
A brofcher-in-law of Sir is gate-
warder, a decent billet as asylum billets go. He
is reserved, but courteous. A relative of a certain
genial politician is also there ; likewise a son of
the Dean of Windsor, England; a Church of
England clergyman (billeted as a warder); two
captains and one colonel of the British Army;
one of the Soudan contingent, a recent arrival;
while a Catholic priest who entered under an
assumed name and vocation died there quite
recently, and an actor, brother of a popular
novelist, left not long ago.
A Bulletin man saw a decrepid old wreck
apply to the clerk for admission. He was hardly
recognisable as one of Sydney’s once brightest
business men, ruined a few years ago by mining
disasters—bloodshot eyes, trembling jaws, matted
hair sticking up through his hat, clothes dirty
and ragged, naked feet taking the air outside of
broken boots, lame and scarcely able to stand ; a
spectacle to move equally pity’s self or adamantine
stones.
Not long ago, a dying inmate, the remains of a
profligate young British nobleman, used to still
receive letters from two or three fashionable Lon-
don actresses. There is, however, only one Im-
perial convict, lagged for stealing a cheese—a
whole cheese, mind you.
The sprinter of the institution is a wooden-
legged man who despises crutches and has estab-
lished a record for 15 yards. A male Malaprop is
a curiosity ; he declared that he had arrived at
the “age of impurity.”
A big fat man, evidently demented, being asked
what was the matter with him, replied: “My
wife cleared out with another bloke.” “Do you
know this is New Year’s Day?” “My wife
cleared out with another bloke,” was his one
refrain. _
To another, a palsied old man, the Doctor —
“This is New Year’s Day, Jack, what do you
wish us?” “Health before all else, sir.” One
inmate is & facsimile of the Duke of Wellington,
and has had a classical education. There sat
down 481 to last New Year’s Day dinner ; but
the hospitals were still overcrowded.
Not long ago two consumptives struck up a
strange friendship and entered into a solemn com-
pact to race for death by starvation, and meet as
soon as possible over the Styx. This grim contest
was tile most appalling spectacle the matron has
seen during 30 years Asylum experience. The
awful emaciation of the starving consumptives
was a transoarency of death.
A hale old man, in company with his third wife,
regularly visits the Asylum to se «"•••. bv lu»
first wife; the son is parchmenting away by con
sumption. Three inmates confess to birthdaj
anniversaries on New Year’s Day.
* * *
Jack B , inmate, was fellow billiard
marker with the elder Roberts at the Athasneum
Moses-street, Manchester, England, and marked
the game when Roberts beat Tom Sharp. H<
declares that Roberts drinks spirits freely and
regularly, generally brandy. 15 has rur
billiard-tables on many of the chief Australia!!
diggings. Twenty-three years ago he hurt hi;
legs at a riot, and, says he, “I’ve had no luck
since then. Ninety-nine out of a hundred pro
fessional billiardists die in the gutter. But I’m
not done yet. My legs are getting better, anc
you’ll see" me down in Sydney marking before
long.”
B tells a yarn of a highly-respected N.S
Wales clergyman who was so passionately fond ot
billiards that he used to sneak by way of a back
entrance into his billiard-room at two o’clock in the
morning, and play him for ill a game until grey
dawn. He also has reminiscences of Jack Conway,
and “ Hamilton, who used to go about with him."
“Old Davy”—a namesake and scion of the
same family as the great African explorer, David
Livingstone—is 80 years old, and keeps up hia
relative’s traditions by spending all his earnings—
lOd. per day as messenger—on his fellow-inmates
and in lollies for the Liverpool children, who rush
him directly they see him. He neither drinks nor
smokes. He has lost two little “rises” by sheer-
robberies. First, the Clarke gang of bushrangers
robbed him of his pile, and left him suspended by
the waist to a branch of a Lee, with his feet just
touching the ground, from which position he was
rescued by a selector’s wife. He next ran a pro-
duce store in Sydney, and, nine years ago,
travelled via America to visit his brother in Eng-
land. At Niagara Falls a burglar eased him of
his wealth, and he returned to Australia. How
he does detest the Caste foolery in the House of
Living Death !
Another inmate participated in the Ballarat
riots, and since then worked several years for
Jimmy Tyson, the millionaire, concerning whose
bachelor and solitary habits of never allowing
a woman near the house, and of camping out on
damper-and-corned-beef ration as a matter of pre-
ference. he is eloquent-
* * #
John Riley, once member of the “Light
Brigade ” (500, will leave his dust at Liverpool
Asylum. He gets a pension of Is. 3d. a day-
half of which is confiscated by the authorities.
Glorious reward for 23 years’ service, and almost
total loss of memory. But he has one idea burned
into his brain by British brutality—the cat ! “1
remember that well enough,” says Riley, sawing
his head from side to side, “ every British soldier
remembers the flogging. I have had to flog men
myself !”
Every morning this demented man-forgotten
soldier crawls to the Asylum authorities, and cries
with piteous pleading—“ For God’s sake, don't
flog me ! Do anything else to me, but don’t flog
me! Doctor, you’ll stop them from flogging me
to-day?”
The old man remembers his morning rations
splendidly, and this may be a great argument in
favour of the lash. It lasts, and is an enduring
lesson. Great God !
Riley describes minutely the Balaklava charge,
his feelings in battle, and his wound. He has
four medals.
Oh, and 7|d v a day !
#~ # *
Corporal Dennis M‘Bweeney, of the 64th
Regiment, has a pension of Is. a day for not being
butchered in the Indian Mutiny, and receiving an
Arab lance in the back of his head. Glorious
war ! All this for fid. a day ! Boys of Australia,
go into the British navy. The Lords of the
Admiralty are waving their hands to you across
the ocean.
George Gibson is an Australian bushman who
went with explorer Giles 700 miles into the interior
of West Australia, where he quarrelled with his
chief and bolted back again alone, except for the
companionship of a retriever slut. He got safely
through in five months, living on ’possums and
mussels. The slut was his huntress and could
“catch anything, and dive into the water and
bring up fish.” When has Brigand Stanley done
anything like that on a lone hand ?
# * *
Grand hundred-year-old Brown, alluded
to above, was born at Canterbury, England.
During years service in the British navy he
took part in 14 engagements. In one at
Malta, in 1803, 175 men were killed on his
ship, a frigate, in which Brown was captain of
the maintop. “ Were 175 killed really ?” “ Yes,
for in those days if a man was wounded anyways
bad, he was thrown through the port-hole.”
Glorious British Service, what debts thy sons
owe thee !
Brown says it was universally known that
Nelson was shot by one Tom Harden, captain
of the maintop of the Victory, in revenge for Nel-
son’s tyranny.
“It was all tyranny and flogging in those days,”
continued the old fellow. “ All of us got flogged
for anything and for nothing. A seaman would
be brought down from the rigging, given two
dozen and sent straight up again to his work. The
officers used to laugh and grin at a man’s cries
when triced up to the triangles ; the louder he
screamed, the more they roared with laughter.
Did I see any men flogged to death ? Only two,
both on the Isis frigate. One sunk down dead on
the grating long before his tally was up, and so
dodged his sentence. The other’s yells were so
awful that the officers fairly split their sides with
mirth. The man went insensible after_five dozen;
so they took him down and promised him a couple
of dozen extra for shamming. Two hours after-
wards he was dead and cold, and they chucked him
overboard.”
# * *
If the past lives of all the Liverpool
Asylum inmates could be cyelorama’d in one
vision, what a kaleidoscope of blood, torture,
bravery, endurance, bad luck and swindling the
seer’s eyes would take in ! One glimpse of such
horrific confusion would ruin the levellest brain.
The butterfly flits through the blossoming tree,
And the cowslip and bluebell are bent by the bee ;
All the creatures that dwell in the forest are gay,
. And why should not we be as merry as they ?

81C Macqnarie-strcet Noitb, Sydney, Feb. 10, 1802
•b Dear Moorarisua,—
There were one or two new features about half-crown
< lay at N.S.W. Horticultural Society’s Summer show, in
the Centennial Hall, on 3rd instant. For one thins, they
played Rule Britannia” instead of “ Gorsave,” etc.,
because a nautical deity. Lady Charles Somt, was butt for
committee compliments on the occasion, and the “never,
never, never is such a novel and suitable air to usher
ihe average patronising party in with to any show, don’t
you think? Lady S. wore a Mack gown, trimmed with
hands of black and silver galon, black hat with feathers,
and a white aigrette, and was backed up by her sister,
Miss Ryan, in a white gown, with twine-lace trimming,
and a black bat with wreath of violets ; and Lord Ancrum
formed the “suite”- kindly lent for the afternoon by
Government House, so to speak. “The bonny Bride of
Buccleuch, ’ as the Scottish gentleman who did all the
speechifying, has for ever christened Lady Scott, carried
a very smart committee posy of mauve-pink flowers,
which considerably relieved her Court mourning. As
people were mostly out at the cricket-match, the crowd
wasn't so lovely to look upon as it usually is on the first
day, and I only want to point a disapproving pen at a
very long lady, attired in a skirt and blouse of scarlet
print, covered with black ink-spots as if somebody had
been pelting full stops at her, the whole topped by T a hat
in the “devil’s colours’’—black and red. Meknoweth
howling tints, that set even false teeth on edge, are largely
the go at ’Oaie, yet how can one forgive the woman who
would wear a fiery frock like that in a Sydney summer,
when it is everybody’s bounden duty to look chromatically
cool at any T rate ?
The show proper was the usaa'. thing. The dahlias, the
pieces de resistance, were very large and bright-coloured,
but they are not graceful vegetables, and one would just
as well pose in front of a woollen pom-pom. They name
some of them very happily, though. For instance, “ Con-
stancy ” was the tag of a hideous bloom the size of a
cheese-plate and of a very bad colour, and the name was
simply a glove-fit for it, since Constancy and Ugliness
jump together, in women especially, don’t you know.
Some of the set exhibits were old friends —indeed, the
gardener of one ex-nautical man must be fairly at his
wits’ end sometimes to know how to set out the old
flower pots from one show to another, and the decorated
tables were like floral lights of other days, too. The
winning festive board was romantic in effect, but it
wouldn’t do practically in a land where the fly falls off
the host’s bald head into the soup right through the
year, for the garniture was asparagus-grass, and
asparagus-grass has the same irresistible attraction for a
#y as a candle has for a moth. By the way, if I were a
prize-table decorator I would resent the bye-law that no
“properties” are to be used. In Melbourne they get up
ail is tic tables with glasses half-full of wine and dessert
strewn in admired disorder on dainty plates and dishes,
&e., and you get a far better idea how the decoration
would work. Besides, it gives a chance to people who are
clever at folding serviettes.
Dahlias, remind m,e of a story about a banker’s wife in a
>.S.\\. country town to whom a friend with a large
garden sends bags of fruit, flower-seeds and vegetables.
The other day the bag gave up what she took to be sweet
potatoes, so she promptly started to boil them-but the
longer they boiled the harder they grew. And then
somebody happened in, and gently broke it to her that she
had been boiling dahlia-bulbs for two hours by Shrews-
bury clock.
According to the Daily Telegraph reporter, Sydney
Dorcas (Tabby) Society “ is doing a great deal of quiet
work.” Now, who’d a thought it! for I’ve general!v
noticed that—
Bat, perhaps, in the “Dorcas” they stifle the riot?
Still it’s hard to think women, en masse, can be quiet 1
It I were a local tin goddess (now please don’t all say
that I am) and somebody asked me graciously to open
this, that, or the other, 1 would reply graciously “ Cer.
t.ainly but on one condition. That you don’t set me up"
on a ten-foot platform ; and no matter how plain I may be
make me the target for foolish flatteries which set the
audience on the broad grin.” It must be very trying to
be at the mercy of any ill-bred committee-man who doesn’t
see the insult of calling a—well —interesting woman
a goddess of beauty. No doubt each daughter of Eve-
thinks herself miles and miles above every other woman,
but a level-headed female always knows when her looks
don’t love her, and to be hoisted on to a platform in front,
of a critical audience and apostrophised as the glass of
fashion and the mould of form must be very displeasing
to anybody but an idiot. Anyhow, for one‘woman who
swallows any publicly-delivered compliment, no matter
bow oily, there are dozens who inwardly resent the
familiarity. And don’t let Dogberry forget it.
Sydney Women’s Industrial League exhibit the fruits of
their industry in a pretty room in Jersey Chambers,
George-street, where “ special salesof sweets, cakes, and
eggs occur every Friday. A great feature of the League
is that they make you any confectionery you fancy at
lowest rates- fig-toffee, for example, which I cannot find
in any Sweet-shop in town. They dressmake largely, (oo,
at very moderate rates, and people who like to see women
self-supporting ought to make a duty of patronising the
League. The only pitfalls I can see are women who have
qo actual need of earning money sending in saleable
“XJOds and making competition keener fo- the real
workers. To make and sell a baby’s frock in order t
have another feather in your hat while there are women
who make such things for a bare living, is, to my way of
thinking, sirapty criminal.
The invitation cricket-match between the Australian
and Lnion Clubs, on the Association Ground, on 4th
instant, was favoured with adorable weather and a top-
skim attendance—women preponderating, of course, for
most of the men were silhouetted in white flannels and
silUen shirts, against the green background of the wicket.
I liked the players (Mr. Chapman captained the “Austra-
lians, including Mr. F. Mitchell, Mr.Onslow, Mr. “Reggie’’
Allen, and Mr. R. Laidley, while Mr. Robinson was
chief of the “ Unions,” in which Messrs. Arthur M’Arthur,
E. S. Cox, S. Laidley, and W, H. Lamb played well for
the losers, so far as I could see)—but where am I after
such a parenthetical far-cry? I liked the way the bats-
men snatched wild and reckless runs where no run s
seemed to he, and there was an air of hilarity about the
match which was exceedingly soothing after the grim
hfe-a.id-death sort of professional cricket we have been
yawning over lately.
In the butterfly throng that fluttered in the reserve
and in the tea-room, a gyp gown was worn by Miss Nelly
Hill. It was of art-green silk marked with cream colour,
and combined with cream and green striped silk and
cream insertion, and further glorified with jewelled
galon ; a smaj; bonnet in black jet and black roses, blush
roses, and a cream lace parasol supplying very satisfac-
tory f.t cetera*. Miss Florrie Hill’s get-up of black
spray id in forget-me-not blue, with trimming of blue
R ngaline shrouded in black lace, hat of gold straw
tiunmed with green velvet and forget-me-nots, was a
worthy sartorial effort; and Miss Manning’s white em-
bioidery frock, worn with a wide straw hat trimmed with
vhat might have been a last rose of summer, had a cool
and simple effect. “By kind permission of Captain
Barlow ” the Orlando band raised the ghosts of bygone
balls by playinggi selection of the best-loved dance-airs of
last season, and amongst those who listened to the lively
strains were Lady Charles Scott, in a black gown, neck-
scarf of white chiffon with a mauve exotic for colour; her
sister, in the harness she were to the flower show ; Mrs.
Merewether, Mrs. (Judge) Wilkinson, just back from
England, and wearing a black silk gown and black lace
Tudor cape with jetted yoke, small black bonnet with a
eiimson rose ; Miss Dight; Miss Ada Fosbery, in a very
fetching black hat and feather ; Miss Simpson, in black ;
Mrs, Spalding and her step-daughter, in muslin gowns—
and so on. Apropos of the play, one well-known clubite
scouting in the field raised a smile for a rather original
catch. As the leathern sphere hurled itself violently
towards bis speaking countenance, he turned his back
and caught it in the hollow of his spine.
rhird day (2nd inst.)of the erieket-matoh (one doesn’t
need to be more explicit) on the Association Ground, be-
held the clerk of the weather out in his waterproof and
the crush of women in the ladies’ stand mostly followed
suit. The air was redolent of the subtle'aroma of
macintosh in which the wise virgins were enveloped, but
a goodly number of foolish ditto held the fort in flimsies
altho' the misty showers must have made the victims in
the frontest benches feel like rows of flower-pots at water-
ing time. I did so long to hand some of those muslin-
gowned idiots a timely cough-drop when I saw them
getting limp. There was a goodly attendance. Captain
and Mrs. M’Neil chaperoned the latest confessed fiancee ;
and Miss Darley, Miss Manning, Miss Nellie Hill, Mr. A.
W. Nathan, Major Churchward, Lieut. Hangar, were
noticeable here and there, but they didn’t stand out as
< i a girl lecently back from a run ’Orae, who wore a red
and cream striped garment which made her resemble a
peppermint-stick on two tootsies. By the way, prattling
artlessly of the members’ stand, it must have sent a cold
thrill through the cardiac region of any Australian patriot
to observe the temper of the mob thereon. For when it
said, “We are winning,” and banged its hand-painted
gamp it did not mean that the “natives” were putting up
a record, but that the Britishers were bounding on to
victory. I had practical proof of this freetrade in national
sympathy. “ Are we winning ? ” asked an innocent gyurl
of a matron who is as Australian as a wombat, but who
has taken a run over to England and undergone the usual
magic transformation. “No—the Australians are ahead 1
said the hybrid mournfully.
Hut the play was the thing on day third-there seemed
to be so much comedy about it. For one thing, the
legend goes that the graceful Grace instantly removes his
flannel-covered batch from the field whenever any-
body in the crowd hoists a rain-shelter, so it was really
thrilling to watch the doctor and see if he spotted some
umbrella that was innocently keeping the drizzle off a
patron in a far corner. And an amusing incident hap-
pened when Bannerman was batting, and all the English
fielders, headed by Dr. Grace, drew in painfully close to
Alexander to catch him on the hop. At which mobbing
a still small voice piped from the Bishop Smith section:
“ Look out yer don’t get yer pocket picked, Alec.! ”
The Sadie Stringham benefit matinee at the Criterion
on sth inst. attracted a ninety-odd-pound house, with
ladies galore from the roof to the floor, so when Fred.
Mason came on with his “I say—boys,” one wondered
where on earth he discovered ’em. The feature of the d.c.
was a semi-society solicitor fanning himself with a penny
fan, and an interesting object on the stage was Amazonian
Jennie Opie, in a black-and-tan frock, singing a ballad
' nicely, but not so nicely as 1 hoped she would. The
musical world expects great shakes from Jennie when she
leaves off being a robber-chief in scarlet tights and takes
to genteel opera and petticoats. The bill was very good,
but the singers and orchestra were at serious cross-pur-
poses now and then-and I also want to enter a protest
against the dual comic song in which two gentle-
men intimated their intention of making one “ Dora’’
their own dear wife. It sounded like Mormonism topsy-
turvy.
Going tearfully for the last time to “ Forty Thieves,” at
the Royal, I found a very good house, with Carrie Swain
in pink silk, chiffon, and many diamonds scintillating in
a prompt box. Gazing gloomily at the fleeting show one
noticed that there are Jacob’s ladders in Pattie B.’s grey
silk trunks, and that the aid of French chalk would
shortly be required for the knees of the chorus, so
perhaps it is best we lose our little Morgiana. Apropos
of the ’mime, by the way, its catchy tunes are whistled
everywhere and by everybody; it is a wonder some
music-monger doesn’t rig up a waltz or lancers, intro-
ducing pantomime airs. It would go off like hot cakes.
There is a sprinting Sydney bank-clerk addicted to
going to soirees and exercising himself when practicable
by a run home in his pumps, who will never do it again
except in bluchers. For he was bounding along a
Western suburb by-way-“ sprinting home against the
milk”—at 3 a.m. recently, when a cold hand suddenly
had him by the collar and the deep voice of the Law was
solemnly indicting him for housebreaking. Not until
after a search for centre-bit and jimmy had failed was his
explanation accepted that his light shoes wore not noise-
less for burglarious purposes, and he was reluctantly let
go with a caution never to do it again.
At a very tip-top Sydney men-roost the membahs pay
extra for the laundried shirt-buzzum of Jeames. Which
is to say if your chop is supported in by a hireling in a.
swallow-tail and a white tie it is ever so much more
expensive than if the mutton were brought to you by a
nondescript helot in slops and a flannel-shirt. But as the
verage clubman Just loves the mise en seine the extra
tees are gladly settled, and the waiters have got so used
to blaok-oloth that if a rough diamond from the sky-line
should object to pay his sartorial footing there would be
some delay in getting clothes to fit the case.
Put not your faith in princes—or women. For it was a
woman who informed me in sepulchral tones that Major
Churchward and a young society lady, whose name I need
not necessarily repeat here, were affianced. But Major
0., who must certainly be accepted as the best authority
on the subject, says there is not and never was any such
engagement, and now I will rise and solemnly contradict
myself—yea, unto seventy times seven.
The late Miss Maud M'Cabe (youngest daughter of F.
B. M‘Cabe, of Russell Vale) had a pretty Wollongong
wedding the other day, the happy man being Mr. Pringle,
manager for the Southern Coal Company. White brocade
and the inevitable orange flowers made the leading lady
look as little like her usual self as possible. The one maid
was an infant in white muslin, and the large wedding-
party, from Sydney principally, was gotten up to the
bonnet-top to grace the occasion. No wedding tour, the
bride travelling direct to her south coast home in a fawn-
and-blue gown, hat en suite.
Women Suffragists still rage in Sydney, and the weakest
point about the disciple who takes a hall to talk in is the
abject way she apologises for being up there. Anyone
with the courage of her convictions wouldn't open her
chin-chin by inferring that her Tistocratic friends were
quite shocked at her being such a “brazen gyurl”(as
Annie lay lor says at the Criterion)*as to leave her proper
drawing-room sphere and get up on a rostrum. Yet that
is what the League’s secretary inferred in saying, at a
Leichhardt meeting recently, “that some of her friends
were surprised because she sought to enlighten those who
gave less time to the study of political economy.” To
a woman, with what she conceives to be “ a mission,”
what does it matter even if the whole of her relatives take
a fit at the mere mention of it? At the lecture, many
trite remarks were aired—most ghastly truth if taken the
right way—the lofty idea, for instance, that “ women
believe in justice more than in charity.” A woman is
painfully just to her own sex. It is justice when she says
that Miss A. is 35, and wears a cork figure ; it is charity
to forget the date of Miss A.’s birth, and admire the fit of
her dresses. Now, which course would ninety-nine women
out of a hundred take with regard to my mythical Miss
A. ! Also, the feminine appreciation of justice is exem-
plified in the way she waits for a penny change even in
the most heart-breaking little shop, or pays a cabby one
Bishop Smith for fifteen minutes up a slippery hill.
Further on, the leoturess confessed how shocked she was
at hearing M.L.C.’s designated fossils; but she shouldn't
have reminded people that among savages “ old members
of the tribe were killed,” because hints come from platforms
in such strange disguises, that you can’t be too careful
really. The wisdom of venerable old age tempered by
the refining influence of the patriotism (!) of woman ” is
the League’s idea of just Government, and if it came to
pass it would simply mean petticoat Government right
out, for who ever knew an old man who didn’t knuckle
down to his housekeeper ? And then the lecturess put in
a bit of self-praise : “ Woman inspires man to noble and
lofty conceptions and had she never existed the poet,
artist, and musician would have lacked the true source of
their inspiration.” Fireworks to conclude—and what a
vista they open up ! “No women—no poitry.” Even the
most chivalrous editor will hide the W.P.B. with its
Spring load of Odes written to say what an angel she is,
and wonder what the world would be without her.
Yours affectionately,
SAPPHO SMITH.

The International Tug-of-War starts at
Darlinghurst Hall (Sydney) next Saturday, and
nearly every place has sent a team, barring the
Benevolent Asylum and the Gaol which remain
unrepresented. At the time of writing eighteen
nationalities or alleged nationalities had entered,
but the unfortunate absence of Johnel Sullivan-
who would either have brought his side out on
top or else stunned the captain of the opposing
team —Slavin, and Peter Jackson has deprived
the show of a lot of muscle. Our idea of a model
team is Slavin, Jackson, Johnel, Mick Dooley,
Beach, Sandow (the “Strong Man ”), Hon. John
Lucas (to be tied to the rope and lean backwards),
long M'Kean (in his wig), one dray-ho#se, a road-

could be got together and properly organised,
we would bet all we have on it.

The course of Melbourne shows still runs
a bit rough. An absolutely crowded house even
on the last night of the week is an unknown
quantity for the time being, and stories respecting
the troubled condition of divers managements are
pitched about at random. Said narratives vary
between mild exaggeration and reckless lying,
however. An occasional “ghost ” may walk rather
“ dotty ” on his near fore leg, but he doesn’t fall
down from exhaustion as often as rumour alleges.
He is a maligned spectre in most cases, and so he
has been ever since Shakespeare’s period. When
Hamlet first observed, “ Alas ! poor ghost! ” that
melancholy young man was really pondering over
the trials and tribulations of “ treasury.”

Frank Clark has left the Gaiety Hall aftei
a long season, and it was understood that Dan
Tracey would step in with a new crowd on Satur-

can give _ points to the Phoenix, is organising
another Silk Stocking Company and engaging an
extra battalion of legs to support him at St.
George’s Hall, where he starts afresh on Feb. 13.

Meanwhile, the Royal pantomime pegs
along in a persevering manner. Billee Barlow
stayed at home to gargle her larynx and tickle
the interior of her face with a feather three nights
last week, and Miss Marie Bernard, a charmer of
french extraction, played Hick Whittington with
his songs cut out. Miss Billee was to resume her
duties, civic and military, on Monday, so the fag-
end of the panto., livened up with new gags and
ditties, promises to hum. Probably “Hick” will
retire for good on the 19th, but it may yet be
arranged to run him for a ninth week. Next
Saturday they give the last matinee show in any
case. The evening profits, after deducting JH2O
for working expenses, are to be handed over to the
unemployed, who have expressed their grati-
tude to George Coppin, and expect their rich rela-
tions to roll up and patronise this special occasion.
The Mayor of Melbourne and Council, with
goodly capon lined, have signified a gracious
desire to come in all their glory to the Royal one
night this week. These dignitaries regard the
story of Whittington as a beautiful example for
the young, and are anxious to impress upon the
public mind the advantages of starting life with a
slap-up pair of silk tights and a choice assortment
of comic songs.

George Musgrove opens the Opera House
on Monday (15th). His Empire Company in-
cludes a phenomenal conjurer in Carl Hertz, and
all the imported stars from Sydney Royal panto-
mime. Rose Hearing, the Graggs, Fred. Mason,
and the Fairy Four will burst forth in a blaze of
specialities, “and the whole will conclude” (as
respectable newspapers are apt to observe) with a
Trench Build D'Action.
Nellie Stewart seems, from this distance,
to have made an unpromising start in London.
The sorrowful conclusion is forced upon us by a
cablegram announcing simply that “ the produc-
tion of ‘ Blue-Eyed Susan ’ was a success and
the press notices are favourable.” When the
cable liar talks in this subdued strain the ease
looks bad.

A Melbourne evening paper has made a

It was not the absence of our own Nellie, writes The
Bulletin London correspondent, that was alone account-
able for the cold reception of “Cinder Ellen ” on her first
appearance at the Gaiety. Even “de boys ” expect more
now-a-days than poor puns, a few bits of sentimental
music (out of place), vapid comic songs, and a pas de six
to amuse them. Not all the efforts of Fred. Leslie,
Lotmen, and Arthur Williams, about as merry a trio as
could well be found, could prevent people from yawning
and wishing for the curtain to fall. In the history of the
Haiety no such chilling premiere has ever been known
for a burlesque. “ Cinder Ellen,” by the way, can hardly
be called a burlesque, for it burlesques nothing, nor is it
a COTnio opera, for it is neither opera nor comic, and it is
decidedly not a musical farce. It is something swi
yeneris, and bad at that. No doubt Nellie Farreti will
"ake matters up a bit, for whatever she does will be
sure to amuse the poor intellects of the Gaiety habitues.

A Melbourne paper tells a queer story of a contortionist
who recently performed at the Alexandra. In the days
when he was young and obscure he called on a manager
and asked for an engagement. The manager didn’t seem
to w'ant him, and asked him sourly what he could do.
“ Well, I don’t know,” said the contortionist slowly.
“ Then you can get out of here. No, hold on ; I’ll engage
you, I will. What salary d’ye want?” The gymnastic"
man looked bewildered at this sudden change of front,
and then he grasped the situation. In his embarrassment
he had unconsciously extended his leg backwards over
his shoulder and was scratching his ear with his toe. M e
dare say this didn’t originally happen in Melbourne.

Melbourne Philharmonic Society held its annual meet-
ing the other night. This organisation has not kept pace
with the times, and was quite as good, if not belter, when
Melbourne was a quarter of the size, wherefore reformers
call for some impulsion from the grand societies of
Chicago or Boston. A little “Opera de Camera” would
be a refreshing change from the qld grind, and a few
years ago the Society did “ Faust” very well. There is a
legend that, in the old day’s, Farquharson was very
drunk, as principal in a sacred concert, when Sara
Flower, the contralto, sat behind him, and sang his
music. The bet was whether Farquharson, as Marcel,
would stand up all the run of the “ Huguenots,” but he
did, and Jim Kitts, as understudy’, got no more chance
than Frank Thornton, understudying for Grossmith, at
the Savoy. Thornton used to come to him with, “ I think

The Gateshead Theatre disaster, with a lot killed, on

This is how the Age starts to describe a new illusion at
Melbourne Waxworks: “ The apparatus of a really

poster constitute a piece of legerdemain, is what fairly
knocks us.
W. F. Terry, formerly manager of the Australian

Mr. Terry.” “ Well, here’s his card.” He went in.

A Melbourne paper, of Saturday, had a roaringly funny
sketch of the concoction of a Great Original Australian
Drama, by Mr. Bosh, the author, Mr. Trefoozle, the
manager, and his wife and daughter, under which thin
disguises were promptly discernible—Messrs. Garnet
Walch, Dampier, Mrs. Dampier and Miss Dampier. The
profession at once jumped to the conclusion that Garnet
had penned the squib, after quarrelling with the Dam-
piers, for it looked as if no one else could have had the
intimate knowledge to write it, and it was all his style.
Probably this hypothesis is mistaken.
Alleged that one Kev. Alfred Walls, somewhere in
America, has dramatised the book of Job in four acts. In
the first act Job is sold up and his house falls in. In the
second his friends arrive, and the star is found sitting on
a real ash-heap and covered with real boils. The third is
devoted to sundry stormy scenes with Bildad the Shuhite
and other disagreeable characters, and in the fourth the
patriarch makes a fresh pile and lives happily ever after-
wards.

A big shark was caught off the Captain
Cook, pilot steamer, at Watson’s Bay (Sydney)
on Sunday last. It was 16ft. long and 10ft. in
girth. The bait used was I libs, of corned beef,

and gave great pleasure to all.”
A North Shore (N.S.W.) genius, after

It was reported to the Fitzroy (Melb.)
police last week that a local hotel had been
deserted, whereupon they went round, and, sure
enough, the landlord and landlady had cleared
right away, leaving the place all alone half a day,
with plenty of liquor in the bar. This is unique.
Spagnolctti : “ The most awful tiling ever
seen in Melbourne was a procession of t v, e unem-
ployed last Saturday, the 6th. They trooped
silently along the pavement of Swanston-street,
Col iins-street, and other main thoroughfares,
fairly and squarely looking in the face the popin-
jays of fashion. It struck me to the very soul,
making me think of that terrible passage in
Carlyle’s “French Revolution,” descriptive of
the gaunt, hungry crowds that haunted Paris, in
1789.

Dear Bulletin, — Be dispute as to eels
in Riverine waters, “ H. 8.” writes in your issue
of 23rd inst. that he saw' “ thousands of dead eels
about four inches long lying on the sand banks of
the Edwards River during a temporary pollution
of that river about 12 years ago.” Is “H. 8.”
quite sure that what he saw were eels and not
leeches? 1 have fished in the Edwards as man and
boy for something like 30 years off and on, and
never saw or heard of an eel being seen in this
river— though I have often caught leeches in it:
and I am strongly of opinion that “ H. 8.”
mistook leeches for eels.— Kyalite, Deniliquin,

The following story is highly commended.
Last Saturday, at Sydney Central Police Court,
a man was fined <£s, with the option of two
months, for something that was euphoniously
described as “cruelty to a horse.” The cruelty
consisted chiefly in knocking large chunks off the
animal, wlxich was so thin that any one could read
small print right through him. Then it seems to
have occurred to the gentleman that the horse
didn’t look nice under these conditions, and being
a man of resource he disguised the injuries by
fastening on pieces of another horse with glue where
the bits were missing. This sets us thinking.
How would Eye-glass Reid look if he were
repaired by having bits of Crick glued on to him ?
The recent banquet to Premier Dibbs, at
North Sydney, more closely resembled the last
feast given by Tinxon of Athens than any modern
outburst of hospitality to an eminent man in
office. The local scribes came thither full of new
and original sayings about “the tables groaning
under the weight of the good things provided,”
and the “cloop” of “ gold-top ”as it was uncorked
to stimulate the flow of wit and geniality. But
frugal counsels had prevailed with the Mayor and
the rest of the bridge-seekers. Champagne was
not there, in its place being Murrumbidgee Port,
at Is. a quart, and lashings of bottled beer. The
meat of both bird and beast was as sinewy and
resistant as the muscles of an approved bruiser,
and sighs and solemnity prevailed. As the chair
man said, “Charge your glasses, gentlemen,’' a
chorus of sorrowful voices asked, “What with?”
it being realised that beer was too hazardous a
bevei'age on which to travel through the toast-
list. The Mayor blamed the caterer, who in turn
blamed the Barmecides. The Ministers got back
as soon as possible to the Austx-alia, and
dejectedly asked for some stewed dado, and a cup
of tea —anything handy, “ but don’t be long about
it.” - The bridge cannot truly be said to have been
advanced a stage.

During 1891 no less than 2,231,399 carcases

total increase of 490,000 on the previous year.
When a certain parson-medico of alleged
bigamy fame was at the N.S.W. gaol known as
“ The Farm ” he had much trouble with some sons
of Belial who resented his praying aloud in the
associated cell. They scoffed, and mimicked him
until he made complaint to the senior warder who,
on learning the facts of the case, ordered him to
pray and read to himself, and not to cast pearls
before swine.
Lange and Thonomann, merchants,
(Melb.), have been lined for labelling as German
lager beer of Australian manufacture. It was not
alleged that the beer counterfeited any particular,
brand ; the firm’s offence was simply pretending on
the labels that it was imported. The prophet is
not honored in his own country and only the far-off
fields are green. It would really appear as if this
defect in human nature should be allowed for in
protective legislation.
Miss Lucy Osburu, erstwhile lady-super-
intendent of Sydney Hospital, has just died in
England at an age unstated in the newspaper
obituary. If we remember rightly, it was she
who nursed the Duke of Edinburgh when he was
shot at Clontarf. Miss Osburn was thoroughly
honest and humane, but a terrible martinet. A
nurse once related that she was watched so closely
that she “ had to run into the hospital dead-house
to read her love-letters. ”
Randall, Queensland emigration-agent, is
still infesting Great Britain as of old, delivering
lectures on the glories of his sult-ty province, and
assuring the British Hodge that he will readily
get 20s. or 255. a week there with rations thrown
in, that farmers and agricultural labourers are in
constant demand, and that every man may become
a prosperous landowner at short notice. At the
same time it is a well-known fact that the Queens-
land agricultural drudge finds it hard to get 12s.
and rations, that there are vast numbers out of
work even on these terms, and that the farmer is
about as hopelessly bankrupt as the labourer him-
self. Therefore, Thk Bulletin asks Randall if
he isn't utterly ashamed of his mean and degrad-
ing billet, and would like to know where he
expects to go to when he dies? If we had his job
we would be afraid to die.
We have received the following from Mr.
W. Wood, of Bourke, secretary to the meeting:
Editor Bulletin.— Sir, —At a meeting of Bourke resi-
dents held last night (nearly 200 being present) the fol-
low ing resolutions were carried unanimously and amidst
great cheeringlst. Moved hy Mr. Thomas White,
seconded hv W. Wood ; “Thai (his meeting endorse the
action of Mr. Kae, M.L.A. for the Mumimbidgee, in
opposing the motion of condolence to the relatives of the
late Duke of Clarence as we consider such motion of
condolence is not. a true reflex of the opinions of the
majority of the Democracy of N.S. Wales; and regret
that a large section of the press has endeavoured to malign
and misrepresent Mr. Rae for his courage and consistent
action in support of Republicanism.” Moved by Mr, D.
Macdonell, seconded by Mr. Gearing, “That the foregoing
resolution be communicated to Mr. Rae, the V\ agga
Advertiser, and the local and metropolitan press.” Mr.
A. Andrews (chairman of the Bourke Branch Shearers
Union) was in the chair. Three cheers were given for
Rae, and three more for the Coming Australian Republic,
which concluded one of the most enthusiastic meetings
ever field in Bourke. Bourke, Feb. 0, 1892.
The only possible euro for the rabbit curse,
is the abolition of the great pastoralist with his
million-acre holding, and the division of the land
into small blocks. The man whose territory is
large enough to make a good-sized principality
cannot cope with the rabbits-he might as well
undertake to pull up all thb weeds on his estate
by hand ; the man with a small farm can exter
minate them, provided there is no great extent of
uncultivated land around him to recruit their
numbers. If the shepherd king is abolished, and
Bis land leased to small selectors at the same
infinitesimal rent which he pays, then there is a
fair chance of wiping out the bunny curse. Possibly
when the trouble has got a little worse it will
have to end in the land being given for a long
term of years gratis, simply on condition that the
rabbit is wiped out, but even that would prove
cheaper in the end than the present method.
Wadham Wyndham, the erstwhile religious
N.S.W. monomaniac, who killed his wife and
three children, has but the vaguest recollection of
the tragedy in which be was the chief actor.
Wyndham is the pink of deferential courtesy, and
one of the best-read of men. As he is seen during
winter months, with mittens, made out of old
cashiered stockings, pacing rapidly up and down
the jagged yard in which he is confined, for the
purpose of keeping himself warm, he looks
“eerie,” but when he stays his course to say
a word to a newcomer, the frosty smile
he habitually wears gives way to a winning
courtesy that dispels the memory of iron gates
and bars, and when he asks the fellow-penitent
if he can play chess, the latter is bound if he can
to admit the impeachment, and sit down to the
slate. This, of course, applies to Saturday after-
noons and Sundays, The method of playing chess
without men has been described before. When it
was first introduced, however, there was an
inrush of faithful and vigilant warders, eager to
detect an infringement of the rules “agin”’
games and gambling; and until constabulary
intellect was bulldozed by a clever device, the
innocent scientific game was boycotted. For
a time chessplayers would take each a
a separate slate, duly squared and marked, retire
to remote distances, and call out to each other
the moves as they were made, and the prison-
warders’ intellects became so much mixed between
these calls that, after repeated cautions, the
guilty persons were allowed to pursue their
nefarious practices.

As an instance of how success promotes

three signatures written by a certain N.S.W.

Frederick Manson Bailey, Queensland
Government botanist, was one of the earliest of
S.A. pioneers—he dates from March, 1839. He
was originally S.A. Government botanist, and

Morell Mackenzie’s death makes one ask,
“How will he appear in history?” Here is the
point to be discussed by the historians: “Did
Von Bergmann and Co. conspire to slay Frederick,
so that he would never sit on the throne?”
Mackenzie said, in effect, that they did.

John Burns was hooted, in addressing the

An Australian millionaire is said to hold

sort of fortune on which a man can afford to hold
independent opinions, and not kootoo, in his
preaching, to the Sanded Sugar interest.
Mr. F. W. Ward, formerly editor of
Sydney D.T., and now cable-correspondent for a
syndicate of Australian papers, will shortly resign
his position. He has succeeded so well in London
as a magazine and editorial writer that he has
decided against the cable business. His place
will probably be taken by Mr. J. M. Morgan of
the Age sub-editorial department.
Thomas Woodward Hill, who died in
Brisbane, Q., the other day, at the age of 7<i, was
for many years printer and publisher of Brisbane
Courier, and had as early as ’39 worked as a
comp, on Dr. Lang’s Colonist ; he was after-
wards on the Free Press, the S.M, Herald, and
Parkes’s Empire. About ’59 he moved up to
Brisbane, and was engaged by the late T. E.
Stephens, remaining in active harness till the
beginning of ’9l.
An edition de luxe of Gerald H. Supple’s
fine poem, “The Dream of Dampier ” (written in
Melbourne gaol) and his miscellaneous pieces, is
contemplated as likely to afford some pecuniary
help in the last years of its now almost
blind author. Supple’s best verse appeared in
the Dublin Nation when edited by Duffy. It
was said of him by Q.C. Aspinall, that if his nose
had been half-an-inch longer he would have
starved—he being so myopic that his nose fre-
quently touched the paper on which he was
penning his editorial contributions to the Age.
Spurgeon vtill be remembered awhile for
the smartness of his texts. Sometimes they were
gallery “gags,” as when, walking on to his
tabernacle platform, and mopping his fat brow, he
shouted, “It’s damned hot!” (This has also been
ascribed to Henry Ward Beecher, but it doesn’t
matter; perhaps they both said it.) But frequently
they were the pithiest of fables, with a subtle
moral hanging to them. When does the orthodox
parson make a start equal to this one of Spur-
geon’s best : “There was a strange dog in my
garden this morning. I aimed a stick at him, and
the animal brought it back to me in his mouth.”

mob. Five minutes after the warrant was served,
the painter was contentedly putting in the long-
sought face, and the bailiff stood posed on the
model’s dais, highly flattered to have his portrait
taken. Some men can gather figs from thistles.
Should Dick Lee’s W. G, Grace letter
keep on turning up, we must again turn his
biography out of its pigeon-hole, and the dose
must.be repeated every time an English Eleven
comes. Richard Egan Lee was son of
that grand old man who started the Mel-
bourne Budget, which provoked a worthy rival,
the Democrat and Citizen. Dick’s father went
one better even than Dick, whose exploits at
Kyneton, Bendigo, and multifarious other places,
are held in memory; for he starred all over
Australasia, working out everv journalistic
diggings.
That expensive pensioner, the late N. S.
Wales Auditor-General, F. L. S. Merewether,
one of the few survivors of the old regime, who
retired at the institution of Responsible Govern-
ment, resides in Essex, to which county his family
belong. The family house is portion of an old
Abbey or Monastery, the property of the Petre
family. Mr. Merewether’s brother was Recorder
of Bristol, and died leaving his large property to
his nephew (the son of F. L. S'.), but there was a
condition attached to the legacy that young
Merevvether should abjure theR.C. faith, in which
lie had been brought up, though his father’s family
are very strict Protestants, The young man de-
clined to accept the money on such terms, prefer-
ring to remain poor. Mrs. Merewether is a sister
of the late John Hubert Plunkett, of N.S.W.
George Watson, of Melbourne—the starter
par excellence of the world, writes a correspondent,
comes of a rare sporting stock. The Carlow
hounds have been hunted from time immemorial
almost by a Watson. A nephew of his who was
formerly in the 13th Hussars, and was noted in
India for his pluck and skill as a horseman, is
master of the West Meath; and an elder brother
of George, though he is close on his eightieth year,
hunts with the Cotswold and holds his own with
the straightest goers. Like his brother, he has an
exquisite seat and hands, and there is no man in
England, except perhaps Sir George Wombwell,
who looks so neat on horseback. The old gentle-
man lives in Cheltenham, where he is most popular.
In appearance he is the very counterpart of one of
those grand old sporting swells who are sometimes
depicted in ancient pictures of the chase.
Graham Berry returns a changed man with
a slimy English accent. His look’s enough—all
the millionaire stockbroker, London City
merchant, ambassador, Pan's Boursian, New York
Wall-streeter, or whatever you like, in store
clothes, paletot, surtout, pullover, and eompactum
umbrella. ‘’Damme! He has a settled, married
look,” says the stout old bachelor. Sir Oliver
Surface, when he returns from India, and finds
his friend of yore, Sir Peter Teazle, “lumbered,”
and Berry has a settled look of you don’t know
what—consols, currency, silver" shower-baths •
velvet-collarish, Rothschildlike. More of a more-
ness, more of a muchitude. All the scrag’s combed
off him, none of the sleeze of the Geelong Woollen
Factory hanging frowsy around the old nimbus
departed. The lion is in the ass’s skin of Sir
Jimmy M’Culloch, and already he talks of
Hancockian dangers, in blasphemy of the banks.

The remains of “ Billy ” Townsend, for
years Chairman of Committees in S.A. Legisla-
tive Assembly, lie beneath an unmementoed,
grass-grown mound—a monument to the ingrati-
tude of hundreds whom he helped over life’s
ruggednesses. Never a rich man, Billy Townsend
made heaps of money as an auctioneer, only to
spend them. By his personal exertions he founded
the Asylum for the Deaf, Dumb, and Blind at
Brighton, S.A., and probably gave away in public
private charity sums that would total up
AoO’OOO. One princely year, when he was Mayor
of Adelaide, he spent £lO,OOO in “functions” and
benevolences. Such a man could die only in em-
barrassed circumstances. His widow lived to feel
the sting of actual poverty. A movement is now
languidly afloat in Adelaide to erect a monument
to his memory. Billy’s first colonial experience
was as a wage cobbler in the shop of Tom Johnson
who still pegs along venerably, although he, too’
has had some hard knocks. His character is tha£

There are few joys in the path of the tired
and hollow explorer, but still, Providence is kind
to him now and then. One day, when the Elder
exploring expedition was at the furthest limits
of its adventurous journey, it was toiling wearily
along oyer the great wilderness and dragging its
commodious feet through the yielding sand, and
.searching the far horizon with its dim, dejected
eye in search of some signs of life or hope. There

■stirred up by the obscene emu. But still its in-
domitable soul kept it up, and it resolved to die
manfully, if it had to die, and be a shining
example to future generations. And then, in that
hour of dark foreboding, a good omen turned up

ements Ionic. I have been a great sufferer
from liver complaint for the past 18 months,
scarcely able to work, the least exertion causing
great fatigue. I did not know what to do with
myseif, I felt so miserable; I had no appetite, a
chdd could have eaten more than I did. One dav
a friend gave me one of Clements Medical Guides
and there I read how Members of Parliament and
other influential people had been thoroughly
cured by Clements Tonic, and I reasoned “If
Clements Ionic cured them, it will cure me ” I
made up my mind to give Clements Tonic and
1 letcher s Pills a fair and honest trial. I knew it
was my last resource, and remember I am only-
giving you a true and faithful statement of un-
case, such as an honest man should give. Mv
eyesight got so bad that on four consecutive nights
I missed four of the largest kangaroos that run in
the mountains. After I had commenced taking
Clements Tonic I took down the rifle to clean it
and, after doing so, I looked along the barrel and
could see the sight, to my great surprise, quite
plainly. I had only taken three doses, and mv
sight was wonderfully clear and distinct. This
speaks volumes, for the effect was simply wonder-
ful in so short a time, that night I killed a
Mal eroo at least 150 yards away. I cannot
speak too highly of the wonderful 'effect of your
remedies. I had all the symptoms which
accompany liver complaint-headache, backache,
indigestion, pains in the chest, ringing noises in
the ears, specks before the sight, partial blindness,
nasty bitter taste, weakness, pains in the sides,
high colored urine, disinclination to work,
poor appetite, drowsiness and sleepiness ; at night
I would jump out of my sleep as if a sharp instru-
ment was being thrust through me, I feared I had
all the diseases under the sun, so miserable was I
but I am now quite well, thanks to Clements
Tomo wd 1 letcher s Pills. The pains in the side
and chest were cured before I had taken half a
small bottle, and as I continued the remedy al)
the other symptoms disappeared. At one time
1 was so weak I could only cradle one hopper-full
of dirt at one time, so severe were the pains in my
back and sides. Sometimes a terrible feeling
would come over me, as if an evil spirit were
approach mg, which would be followed bv extreme
giddiness and prostration. Lots of other people
m this locality have been similarly cured by these
remedies, and I earnestly entreat all people
afflicted as I was to follow my example at once,
for ‘a stitch in time saves nine.” I have lived
ie . r ® °i n !ln( ',°^ 1 f. 01 twenty years, and have been
settled on the Bingara goldfields continually for
the last six, and am well known, X never intend
to be without Clements Tonic and Fletcher's Pills
as long as there is a shot in the locker,” and I
now never fear a relapse, because I take an
occasional dose, and it keeps me in perfect health.
You are at liberty to make what use you like of
this, for I consider it everybody's duty to give an
account of their case where they have derived so
much benefit from a remedy as I have from
Clements Ionic.—Yours very truly,
Bingara Goldfields, N.S.W.

When the Melbourne unemployed set out

What does Premier Dibbs mean by a
“ red-hot Socialist ?” Is the term any more one
of reproach than “red-hot Protectionist ’ or red-
hot Freetrader ?” Such phrases are expressive of
either ignorance or class prejudice —or both.
Census returns show that Canadians are
emigrating into the States faster than they 7 are

Sydney Echo says that Premier Dibbs is
not likely to be offered a knighthood, as Queen
Victoria’s advisers “ will think twice before they
offer the honor to a separatist.” Queen Victorians
advisers would rather offer a bribe than a reward.
W. R. Campbell, M.L.C., in N.S.W.
Legislative Council : “ Men of culture who lead
public opinion are mostly men of no property
living from hand to mouth ; while many men who
own much property may have acquired it by the
lowest practices.”
Traill remarks that G. H. Reid’s proposal
to increase the N.S.W. succession duties is all
right in its way, yet it is the most unvalorous sort
of attack on Property. Afraid to attack capitalists
living, Reid can only summon up nerve enough
to pillage their coffins,
Ex-Treasurer M‘Millan thus defines his
attitude towards G. H. Reid, elected leader of
N.S.W. Opposition :
I want you thoroughly to understand that I don’t
accept you as my leader, but I recognise you as leader of
the Opposition. " (Cheers.)
According to Rev. W. R. Fletcher, a
fellow-traveller, General Booth was anxious to
secure concessions from the W.A. Government for
one of his colonies, and Fletcher acted as his
agent in the matter. The W.A. Government
couldn’t commit themselves, however.
“Mr. Wentworth has said that if certain
persons—the arch-anarchist (Parkes) he supposed
amongst them—got the upper hand, they would
trample on the country with an iron heel; but the
truth is, that we are seeking to rescue the country
from the iron heel of others.” —Parkes in 1853,

Parkes throws mud again at the “ Labour ”
members of the N.S.W. Assembly—this time in
the Contemporary Review, He writes that the
“ labour party has been demoralised and shattered
under the tutelage of the Protectionists.’' lor
Protectionists read Parkes and his friend Cotton,
and the truth is told.

other side employed mostly paid men, selected
from the unemployed.
Sir C. Napier: “As to Government, all
discontent springs from unjust treatment. Idiots
talk of agitation. It means injustice. The cure
for discontent is to find out where the shoe
pinches, and ease it. If you hang an agitator,
’ but leave the injustice, instead of punishing a
villain, you murder a patriot.”
Protection enriches men -not by taxing
them, but by prohibiting the introduction of goods
derived from countries of low-graded standards
of comfort. Where alleged instances of failure
under protective tariffs are misquoted, the fault
lies in the non-soientific classification of the free
and protected items on the Customs-list.
Justice Hood (Vic.) disputes the dictum
of the Victorian Parliament, that the Victorian
law-dealer may appear in Court miwigged. in
ordinary costume. He must be informed, even at
the cost of his dismissal from the bench, that the
law, like the judge, is the creature of the Parlia-
ment, and that the statutory expression of the
people’s will is paramount over judge-made laws.
G. R. Dibbs will probably be the first
avowedly Republican. Premier of a British posses-
sion to pay homage to Queen Victoria. He goes
to London, it is said, to explain to the money -
dealers that the province was thrown on its beam-
ends by Parkes’ senile administration of its
finances. And some politicians say that Dibbs
has a card up his sleeve to play in connection with
the railways and the public debt.
If Premier Dibbs waits a little longer he
will not have to “swamp” the N.S.W. Legis-
lative Council—it will be swamped by Death.
Mr. Dodds, M.L.C., a veteran nonentity, is the
latest to succumb. By the way, the exhibition
which the Legislative Council made of itself, the
other night, on the occasion of the one-man-one-
vote debate, was more painful than anything ever-
seen outside the senile debility ward of an
asylum.
Premier Ballance, of Maoriland, twits
those who talks about the sensitiveness of Capital.
Capital, says he, is selfish, not sensitive, and
where it can gee high interest there it flies. To
maintain this in M.L. is no policy for his Govern-
ment, and as far as his placing obstacles in the
way of the building-up of big estates is concerned,
he prefers encouraging the small ones at their
expense. As long as a good export trade is pro-
curable, no country need fear decline in wealth or
power.
We would point out to the Queensland
Government, which, in the face of an unemployed
problem in its own house, imports
foreign labourers to increase the difficulties of the
position, that no Government in the world—not
even under a Socialistic regime—can provide
occupation for all hands when unlooked - for
elements of this description are ever impending
to comnletely disorganize all trade arrangements,
and overturn what may be termed the commercial
equilibrium.
It is two years to-day since the Federal
Conference affirmed that the Australias should
join in an early union under the Crown. Parkes
pretended to be very sanguine as to the early
realisation of his dream, ajid even went so far as
to prophesy that the Australians would become a
federated people within two years. The period of
two years expires to-day, and the union under
the Crown ” is still far off in the womb of time.
“Under the Crown” is an ominous text for an
Australian statesman to take who wishes to fuse
the Austral provinces.
Mr. Willis, M.L.A., makes a foolish move
in endeavoring to have his name replaced on the
N.S.W. Commission of the Peace. The Bulletin
does not propose to here argue whether his name
was rightfully struck off, for that has no bearing
on the present' question, which is ; Supposing lie
had never been a J.P. at all, is be the sort of
person who should now be appointed to the bench .
Willis’ best game is to pretend that he doesn’t
wish to be a J.P. any more-that he loathes and
despises the position, just as his friend Parkes
loathes and despises Ministerial office.
A very thin farce was played by Munro
and Minister Wheeler, who reigns for the moment
over the Victorian Public Works department. In
his old character of Premier, the unblushing
Munro called upon Wheeler with a deputation
from Geelong to beg the further loan of a Govern-
ment dredge for that sleepy, pettifogging little
fool of a town. Munro and his colleague kept up
a pretence of pleading and remaining firm re-
spectively, for several minutes, but they both
knew dashed well that Geelong wouldn’t get any
'more dredge." ’ And it didn’t. Geelong is for
everlasting being lelt, but it doesn’t lose heart.
The Lord is its shepherd.
Patriotism to-day is a virtue, but in the
future, when the federation of the world ha;
come within the bounds of practicability, the
evolutionary tendency of morality will declare it?
observance a vice. A protective tariff simply
requires that the country practising its principles
shall work out its own destiny, and maintain and
develope its standard of comfort unharassed by
the disturbing actions of foreign territories; in
proportion as it raises its domestic level, -so must
its fiscal impositions be heightened where neces-
sary to ward off the attacks of foreign competi-
tors who, under Freetrade, lower their level.
Whenever all civilised nations shall stand on
something like an equal footing as regards social
and moral characteristics, international Freetrade
and unrestricted mundane intercourse will be
practicable and beneficial to the entire interests of
progressive humanity 7. In the interim, let each
look to his own house ere adopting the idea ot
clubbing together in an edifice of the Peabody
pattern.
Dear Bulletin, —The National Association
(N.S.W.) is zealously engaged in trying to stuff
the electoral-rolls with the names of well-dressed
respectabilities. Out of idle curiosity a landless
city man waited upon a representative of the
association the other day and requested that his
name might be registered on the rolls of several
large suburban electorates. The official, always
ready to oblige the respectably dressed, noted the
name, with the numerous fictitious qualifications ;
and in due course the name will no doubt be
“ passed ” by the different Courts of Revision on
the mere ipse dixit of the association. An appli-
cant for enrolment is not required to produce any 7
evidence of' his bona fides : a well-cut suit is the
best recommendation he can take to the anti-
democratic association. The landless city 7 man
told some friends of his adventure, and the end of
the affair was that four men became plural voters
through the good offices of the “ National ” Asso-
elation.-
T.J.D.
Sir John Hay, in his younger days, was
regarded as the leader of the “ high Tory-party,”
in N.S. Wales, by David Buchanan, who once
sketched his countryman’s style in this fashion ;
Anyone not possessed of a very quick ear would take
Mr. Hay for a thoroughbred Cockney ; and in Scotland
there is no treason so high as any of her sons daring to
attempt to catch the English accent. His accent is an
outrageous mixture of the broadest Aberdeenshire dialect
with the most rampant Cockneyism. For instance, he
calls “act,” “ ect,” and “own” he sounds like “noun,
and “ thought” he sounds “ thote,” all of which is highly
ludicrous when taken in connection with his prevailing
and studious, but withal futile, efforts to pass himself for
a Londoner. His manner is most decidedly artificial and
affected. He is beyond all doubt a vastly over-estimated
man. As a speaker he is contemptible; as a debater,
nowhere; and I cannot for my life understand how he has
acquired the influence winch lie undoubtedly possesses,
unless it is in consequence of his pompous ya-ya style, his
affectation of a superfine refine meiit, and from the
tendency of the poor forlorn effeminate ciealnres with
whom lie mixes to look up to him as tlie type ai.el bean
ideal of lofty hauteur and aristocratic damp bin. He- is
elevoid of energy, courage, intrepidity, sincerity, or
earnestness.
How many Australian politicians, except
Ham. Griffith, can draw up an Act of Pailiame nt
that will hold water V 4 lie latest exploded statute
is the Victorian Local Option Act. One of its
essential provisions is the appointment of local
Courts of Arbitration to deal with certain ques-
tions regarding cancelled licenses, &c. A small
proportion of thfe members of these bodies are to
be nominated by the publicans, and the balance
by the ratepayers. Therefore the publicans at
Maryborough have paralysed the whole scln me
by simply refusing to nominate anybody. 4 lie
Act can’t legally work without the Court of
Arbitration; the Court of Arbitration can’t be
legally constituted unless the publicans are repre-
sented ; and there is no proviso to compel tin-
publicans to nominate representatives—the Act
simply says that they shall do so, hut it makes no
arrangement for enforcing that bald statement.
Almost any ordinary ass might have foreseen this
awful discrepancy, but as it happened no such ass
was on baud at the time, and so after a whole
generation of teetotal agitation, eveiything is
practically Just where it started.
A cold-blooded Sassenach, who “has
bitter memories of the Civil Service injustices
perpetrated in Victoria through Dully and
O’Shanassy,” sends us the following :
A N.S.W. DEPARTMENTAL DITTY.
’Tis said that a rose by a new appellation
To average nostrils would smell just the same,
But I’d like to explain in the ears of the nation
The virtue that lies in a good Irish name.
In the Grasshopper-Crushing department a billet
Was vacant, and lo ! one fine morning there crane
A host of competitors itching to fill it,
And one of them sported a fine Irish name.
Now, the head of the office, with champagne made merry,
Had often been heard to refer to his claim
To kinship with royally planted in Kerry
By virtue of owning an old Irish name.
Two men who applied for the billet I write of
Held hands that were good in the log-rolling game :
The one had a record that none could make light of,
The other was blessed with a sweet D ish name.
Hurroo ! for the land of O’Flynn and O’Connor,
And praise to the saints who are guaiding its fame,
For the billet was filled by a scion of honour—
The man who rejoiced in a good Irish name.

Two absolute essentials for the existence
of the human race are—land and air. Many
economic and political systems have been invented
and are advocated for obtaining land for each
individual to live upon, but it has been left to the
Hydraulic Cooling and Ventilating Co. to intro-
duce pure air into every habitation in Australia,
by means of their “ Perfection Cooler and
Ventilator. By attaching this machine to your
water supply or tank, and simply turning on the
tap, a constant stream of pure, fresh air can be
obtained in any chamber you desire. Punkahs
are thus superseded, perishable goods can be kept
at a small expense without ice, and you can enjoy
the luxury of a cool chamber on the hottest day or
night. r l he machine, which is simplicity itself,
works at the cost of one half-penny per day, while
the price brings it within the reach of most.

have no extradition treaty there, but they have
what is as bad—a law by which any suspected or
otherwise objectionable person can be hunted out
of the kingdom. This law is put into operation
just according to whether the Government who
want a criminal or the criminal himself are pre-
pared to spend most money in greasing the local
authorities.

Talk about foreign-trade ! There is irresis-
tible internal evidence in a review of an Austra-
lian-written but London-published book, which
was printed the other day in a “great” Sydney
journal, that the reviewer wrote within the sound
of Bow Bells ! After this, what is the value of
Australian press-opinion ?

The Melbourne lager-beer case (which was
a for chappies who can’t dwink the
beastly colonial stuff, doncherknow) tempted
Panton, P.M., to observe that other descriptions
of liquor brewed in the district were being sold
as. foreign imports. This remarkable statement
is said to have inspired the Customs Department
with hopes of effecting more captures. Innocent
Customs Department! What whisky-drinker
doesn’t know that popular brands of Scotch and
Irish are imported here in the bulk, and mixed
with choice Australian spirit (about a fortnight
old) before being put into the “home” bottles?
And who doesn’t know that Scotch whisky-labels
are printed in Melbourne to orders of, say, half a
million at a time ? These facts are in every mouth
—of an evening, and one can’t get them out of his
head —next morning.

Old John Harris’s estate, valued at
.£1,200,000, has been placed by the N.S.W.
Equity Court in the hands of the N.S.W, Per-
petual Trustee Company until over 30 alleged re-
latives, who claim shares, prove their bona fides.
This is a profitable piece of business for the com-
pany, whose shares have already gone up in price.
* # #
By the way, Trustee Company shares are
good investments. The Trustees, Executors and
Agency Company of Melbourne (founded in 1889
by the late William Templeton, one of Berry’s
“Black Wednesday” victims) last week paid a
dividend of 35 per cent. The two N.S.W. com-
panies—the Perpetual and the Permanent —have
not yet paid a dividend, but the shares are at a
premium—the former nearly 100 per cent over the
amount paid for them.

Melbourne Institute of Journalists pro-
poses to damn itself by admitting proprietors.
Also, a crowd of other people only half a degree
less remotely connected with journalism are
already raked in. It is anticipated that the whole
of Parliament will be asked to join, inasmuch as
theM.P.’sare regular contributors to Hansard.
The leader-writer of the Police Gazette should
also be, ex officio, a member of the council, and
the poet of the- Butchers’ Monthly is distinctly
eligible.

Judging by the cables, the Privy Council
has upheld the judgment of N.S.W. Full Court in
the case brought by the London Chartered Bank
against the Government over the Hiddilston
frauds; consequently the bank loses JIGOOO drawn
by Registrar-General Ward on the overdraft
“negotiated ”by Hiddilston with the bank. This
is pretty rough on the bank, seeing that every
penny drawn by Ward went into the Treasury.
The judgment of the Full Court was laughed at
by every prominent lawyer when it was delivered,
and probably surprised no one more than the
Crown counsel.

The British Privy Council is conducted
very much after the style of a theatrical perform-
ance. The Court where the Judicial Committee
sits is rather small and the bench is enclosed by a
curtain which is rung up when the Court opens
and the Councillors are in their seats. The
counsel who has the right to address the Com-
mittee first then takes up his place in a sort of
forum and argues his case, after which the oppos-
ing counsel delivers his argument. The curtain
is then rung down again. The Privy Council
never delivers impromptu decisions all its
deliverances take the form of written judgments.
Solicitors are not allowed to be near counsel to
instruct them—in fact, the Privy Council, which
is composed of retired Judges, totally ignores the
existence of the lower branch of the profession.
The Council has a freer hand than any other
tribunal in the world—it is not bound by previous
decisions of any sort, and from its judgment there
is no appeal.

M‘Crow, the latest Sydney edition of
Othello, cut his wife’s throat, attempted suicide,
and confessed all. “Jealousy, cruel as the grave,”
the most easily kindled and most terrible brute
passion ! Here, indeed, you have an example of
the deterrent effect of the gallows. Twenty years
ago M‘Crow’s brother, also a butcher, killed a
woman under almost precisely similar circum-
stances, attempted suicide in the same way, and
was carefully hanged; now we have the wretched
M/Crow repeating his brother’s deeds! When
will it be recognised that the dupe of jealousy—
utterly irrational, groundless jealousy in this case,
apparently—is a monomaniac; a man possessed
of a demon ? Othello, in the whirlwind of his
passion, is nothing but a splendid madman.
We once knew a schoolboy of 17 who was
infatuated with a woman twice his age. A
man’s face at her window, and a refusal to
admit him to her house sent him raving. While
the delirious attack lasted it took three policemen
to hold him. He struck the iron railings in front
of the house_ with his bare fists, smashing his
knuckles to pieces, he broke his teeth on the hand-
cuffs as he strove in his frenzy to devour them.
vV here is the deterrent for such a passion ? “It
is necessary to remove the jealous murderer from
the world with all other murderers,” says society.
But then we are all jealous, and we are all
potentially murderers. The man who thinks he
is of flint has not collided with the woman who
is steel. That is all.

unfortunately through the Duke’s demise a month prior
to the wedding-day, this tablet was consequently substi-

the lady had no opportunity of making a will, for
she took ill just before her husband’s demise and

Cabled that the Earl of Ranfurly is going
to visit Australia. Nothing is known of the Earl
in Australia, save that he has a son on the Mil-

many years, yet every time we take up a paper we
meet with the name of a new (to us) British

It is rumoured that a very “ big ” Sydney
business man means to buy up the whole of the

A French convict escapee lately captured
in Melbourne is credited with being the victim of
an ocular disease, which renders him blind, except
at night when he can see like a cat. This disease
is generally called Burglary.
Which recalls in a roundabout way a charming
Melbourne lady who ordinarily was stone-deaf,
but who could yet hear the faintest whisper
between two people in a train. When Reginald

partment right opposite her what a picnic that
deaf lady used to have ! Her deafness had only

The health of the Princess May, fiancee of

An especially holy Tasmanian parson
makes a practice of lying-low among the
one of the hills behind his town—a locality much
frequented by lovers —to watch for any impro-
priety of conduct, or any language of a worldly
character. Then if he sees a youth hugging
his girl, he solemnly emerges from his
retreat, and addresses a Christian remon-
strance to him. Sometimes he gets bruised
by the ungodly roysterer for his interference, and
once, when he came out suddenly from a hole and
ottered a few words of brotherly reproof to a
newly-married person who was sitting with his
arm round his wife’s neck, he got badly licked.
In fact, he was absent from the pulpit for two
weeks, it being officially reported that he was
suffering from the “chastening hand of Pro-
vidence.

Superintendent Toohey, commanding the
police in Western Victoria, is now to be super-
annuated. When the Kelly gang were abroad in
nailcan helmets and ploughshare armour, Toohey
then only an inspector, was detailed to the charge
of the disturbed district and expected to run the
Kellys to earth. At that time there Jived at
Mansfield a lawyer’s wife who was passionately
fond of equestrian exercise. Her riding-costume
usually consisted of a gentleman’s stiff hat, a water-
proof habit and thick veil. It washer wont to take
long rides towards the W ombat Kansfes, which
concealed the favourite haunts of the Kellys. One
day, as she was returning homewards from this
direction she met Toohey, to whom she was un-
known, and so no greetings were exchanged,
toohey had not gone far when he met a practical
jokei named M‘M ill an, of whom lie enquired as
to any current rumours. “Don’t you know?’
tv- i! ~^ ac ‘ “What?” asked Toohey. “Ned
Keiiy is known to be on his wav to Mansfield dis-
guised as a woman.” “Yerrah!’ exclaimed
toohey, and lie wheeled round smartly and wild-
goose-chased the lawyer’s wife, bailing her up
just as she was dismounting at her own front
gate, it cost the gallant officer a written apology
and no end of chaff and hurt vanity to get over
that hoax. -
The great obstacle to any dress-reform,
says Woman, is that “not more than one English-
woman out of ten has a foot and ankle that will
bear inspection.” In other words, the female
with the bed-post extremity blocks the wav.

A new parson was recently imported to

A VALENTINE.
(F OR THE BULLETIN.)
The Bree was up ; the floods were our
Around the hut of Culgo Jim.
The hand of God had stopped the drought
And filled the channels to the brim ;
The outline of the hut loomed dim
Among the shades of murmurous pine,
That Eve of good St. Valentine.
He watched, and to his sleepy gaze
The dying embers of the fire,
Its yellow reds and pearly greys,
Made pictures of his younger days ;
Outside the waters mounted higher,
Beneath a half-moon’s sickly shine,
That Eve of good St. Valentine.
•liThere, in the great slab fire-place
The oak log—burnt away to coal—
Showed him the semblance of a face
Framed in a golden aureole ;
Eyes, the clear window of a soul,
Soul; of a maid, who used to sign
Herself, “Jim, dear, your Valentine.”
Lips ; .whose pink curves were made to bear
Love’s kisses, not to be the mock
For grave-worms. Suddenly a “ whirr,”
And twelve loud strokes upon the clock ;
Then at the door a gentle knock—
The collie dog began to whine
That Morn of good St. Valentine.
He opened ; by his heels the hound
Sniffed at the night, “ Who comes, and why ?”
What ? no one ! Hush ! was that a sound ?
Methought I heard a human cry.
Bah 1 ’twas a curlew passing by
Out where the lignum bushes twine.
This Morn of good St, Valentine.
What ails the dog? Down, Stumpy, down.
No? Well, lead on, perchance a sheep
It is, poor brute, that fears to drown.
Heavens ! how chill the waters creep,
Why, Stumpy, do you splash and leap ?
’Tis but a foolish quest of thine,
This Morn of good St. Valentine.
Nay, not so foolish as I thought.
Hark ! ’mid those reeds, a feeble scream.
Mother of God ! a cradle’s brought
Down from some homestead up the s treat,'
A white-robed baby ! Do I dream ?
No, ’tis that dear dead love of mine,
Who sends me thus a Valentine.

W. H. Burgess, ex-M.P.,
for bringing about the
failure of the V.D.L.
Bank. The reproaches of
the shareholders are all directed against Burgess,
as if he had been the chairman of the board of
directors. Although his overweening vanity used
to lead Burgess to talk and walk as if he were the
head of the board, yet he was a very ordinary
guinea-pig ; and the chair was filled by a wealthy
gentleman who used to be wheeled into the board-
room. Strange that the name of Burgess should
be in the mouth of every shareholder and deposi-
tor, while such a substantial man as John Pearce,
and such a rich estate as E. P. Wilson’s, are at

The new P. and O. boat, Oriental, is a
fast and splendid vessel, but, up to date, people
dislike her greatly. “We can’t travel by that
steamer,” they say unanimously ; “it’s only got
one funnel.” The average passenger thinks that
the funnel is the thing that shoves the vessel along,
and the craft with two chimneys is consequently
supposed to go just twice as fast as the vessel with
one—which is ranch the same as assuming that
the man who smokes tw r o cigars walks twice as
quickly as the man who only smokes one. The
P. and O. Co. had better build some four-funnelled
steamers and monopolise the trade,

A gratifying episode came off the other
night by moonlight at Balmain (Sydney). A boat
with three dudes came floating along, and passing
a water-frontage mansion the occupants caught
sight of two girls in the garden, and did a
mash. Then the two biggest dudes landed and
proceeded to hug the girls, while the smallest one,
having no girl, sat in the boat. Next
inevitable old man appeared at the landing-stage,
and ordered the small dude to get out of that,
and being scared at this sudden apparition the
gilded youth hastily paddled away. A moment
later the parent caught sight of the two visitors,
w ho were embracing his daughters beneath a tree.
He plunged after them with a howl; they ran for
the boat; there wasn’t any boat; their enemy was
close behind, and the harbour was in front; and
with a yap of terror they took to the water and
swam for it. The scene closed with the old man
firing bricks after his visitors in the moonlight,
and every time he aimed a fresh brick they uttered
another howl and dived to avoid the missile.
THEY DIDN’T MIND.

principle, it is quite refreshing to hear that at
some place on the Cameroons where they were
storming a native citadel the German soldiers
turned tail and bolted. They were driven forward
again by their officers,. who> beat them with their
swords. Atwell-known war correspondent told

A movement is “on foot” for bringing
Moody and Sankey, the tuneful gospel-grinders,
out to Australia. The Bulletin had an impres-
sion that this awful pair had clawed each other
badly over the division of the gate-money, but it
would appear that they still carry on the same old
game. Anyhow, they would probably strike a
profitless reef if they came to Australia just yet.
There have been so many people out here of late
who lived by searing weak citizens into fits, and
then cleaning out their pockets before they re-
covered their senses, that there is hardly any-
thing left to annex that is worth annexing.

The other Sunday a small army of Mel-

a demonstration. They made their demonstration,
but it fell rather flat, and most of them seemed
sorry that the service wasn’t shorter. There was
one interesting feature about the proceedings,
however. Previous to the men invading the
sanctuary a mysterious-looking D. crept up to one
of the canons and whispered the awful warning
that 300 vulgar persons were about to swoop in
and secure the best seats. Had they better be
arrested for insulting behaviour? The canon
meekly replied that there were no best seats in a
Cathedral, whereupon the active and intelligent
detective frowned ominously and retired to watch
the proceedings in the interests of the Crown.

tearing, punching, kicking charge to the lock-up.
The scene reminded one of the Spartan carrying
the fox.
# # *
In the early days of Shepparton (Vic.) the
lockup consisted of a 400-gallon malt-tank, with
a square hole cut in the top, across which there
was a hatchway of irm bars. Into this drunks
and “ righteous ’’ behaviour offenders were promis-
cuously bundled and kept caged until they sobered
up. When the thermometer was high the pri-
soners came near being baked, and relieved their
feelings with dismal howling, which, at night
time, brought round the tank all the dingoes
of the neighborhood to indulge in a chorus of
sympathy—under the impression that some of their
mates had been trapped.
Another Sydney Evening News item.
Something like a matrimonial ad.
WANTED.—The Advertiser (whose previous
’ ’ occupations have prevented him from selecting
a life partner in the orthodox manner) being desirous
of settling in Sydney and entering into a business for
which he is peculiarly qualified, wishes to meet with
a y oung WOMAN corresponding as closely as possible
to the following description : Age not over 28, good
figure, wholesome complexion, sound constitution
and health, cheerful disposition, and sufficient intelli-
gence and educational acquirements to render her
companionable indispensable, while music and other
accomplishments when not acquired at the expense
of those of a more domestic nature would be
appreciated. Having sufficient means to carry out his
projects, and apart from business prospects of an
encouraging nature, the certainty of a future com-
petence, the Advertiser does not seek any pecuniary
qualification, nor does he, while inviting the fullest
confidences in all matters (and preferring to know 7 the
reasons that might actuate an eligible applicant),
desire to avert or mar a happy union by raking up
the buried past. The Advertiser may be generally
described as under: Medium height, age 84, muscular
and athletic figure, superior education and origin,,
proficient in many manly acquirements, exercises,
and occupations, of a decidedly cheer ful and domestic
disposition, and possessing a constitution unvitiated
by any form of excess or dissipation. In order to
facilitate and, as far as practicable, ensure a desir-
able selection, the most minute and complete
particulars on all points of interest are requested.
Applicants having only frivolous objects in view are
requested to save themselves the trouble of com-
municating. Letters containing photos (which in all
cases will be promptly returned) will meet with the
earliest consideration. The contents of all communi
cations will be regarded as strictly confidential, anc
except in such cases where selection renders a brie
retention unavoidable all letters will be destroyed ini
mediately alter consideration. The address wil
indicate that the advertiser has taken every possihl.
means to ensure safe delivery and secrecy.

BOY LABOUR.
(By one of the Unemployed.)
“ ‘ Wanted, Respectable Boy,’
But apply I don’t see how I can %
What they want’s a respectable hoy,
And I’m but a respectable man.’'’
The Phcenix.
With a Journalists’
Club established in Mel-
bourne—not a mere fast
and shady boozery for
all sorts of people—one
reviews some of the
Southern penmen, past
and present. Edward
Wilson’s is the first
name. A poor writer,
loose thinker, but big-
hearted man, and he had
energy to take the biggest
prizes of his day. James
Smith is thedoyen. David
Blair lumbered usefully
along under a tremen-
dous deadweight of dry-
asdust preparation as
pulpit pundit; G. P.
Smith and H. J. Smith
carried on the slaughter-
oustraditionsof Ebenezer
Syme; Jardine Smith
wielded a brilliant but
insincere rapier; Wil-
loughby, though never
snatching a grace beyond
the reach of art, has
been toilful, quizzical,
fancy-fraught; Cullett is
honoured both in Mel-
bourne and Sydney ;
Deakiu unbuttoned great
reading, but is more at
home as speaker than
writer ; Windsor is a
marvel of satiric conden-
sation ; Fitchett dis-
tances any parson who
has tried the pen in Mel-
bourne, though there be
such a parson-proclivity;
Charles Bright was a
pen Apollo; J. B. Thomp-
son, a slashing slaughter-
er with only one fault—
he never could keep
Dickens out ; Marcus
Clarke could write a
better leader than any-
one once in a while, but
when he couldn’t he
was an unblushing prig-
ster.
Melbourne burglars have lately developed
a waggish tendency to enter military strongholds
in the middle of the night and beard the sleeping
lion in his lair. Last week the irreverent mis-
creants raided the premises of the Commandant
and carried off all the available togs belonging to
that distinguished warrior and sundry visiting
colonels as they lay adreaming of foreign invasions
and furious attacks by the enemy. When the
booty had been safely removed it occurred to one
burglar to throw a brick at the front door, where-
upon the Majah-General’s son woke up and dis-
charged a revolver at some retreating footsteps,
whilst the now startled warriors (who are demons
when roused) made valiant endeavours to find
their stolen trousers. But a few days before this
a burglar treated the defence forces with such pro-
found contempt that the case wasn’t reported to
the police for fear of demoralising the local
military spirit. The beast broke into the Officers’
Club as soon as its gaudy lodgers (nine in number)
had retired to rest, and went through all their
pockets. Each gallant defender had a naked
sword under his pillow and a gun within easy
distance, but the burglar got there just the same.

THE BEALE PATENT
HIGH ARM SEWING MACHINES
Have, by their continued merits and the general
satisfaction they have invariably given, won the
first place in public esteem, and are on all sides
admitted to be the best and most useful sewing
machines in the market.
FOR USE IN THE HOUSEHOLD
The Beale Machine presents innumerable advant-
ages. The mechanism and the adjustments are
perfect, while the working is most simple; and
the addition of all the most recent inventions and
improvements renders the manipulation of every-
thing connected with the machine a matter of
perfect ease. The result of this is, that with
ordinary care the machine will last for many
years, nothing can get out of order, and no time
is vyasted in tiresome meddling with the parts.
It is a servant that will never grumble, never
rebel, never want nights out, willing even on
washing days. It only asks for a careful cleaning
now and then, a snug, dry corner and a little
genuine sewing machine oil. Any other oil will
make it sick, and dirt of all kind it abhors.
The Self-threading Shuttle, of solid steel,
saves the trouble of threading by the end of the
cotton. It has an excellent tension, is strong and
simple.
The Bobbin Winder is a marvel of in-
genuity, winding and guiding the cotton by
itself, as evenly as upon the reel whence it came,
and stopping of its own accord when the bobbin
is full.
For all kinds of family sewing and fancy the
Beale Machine has the greatest capacity.
The Improved High Arm. A great de-
sideratum with ladies has been the raising of the
arm of the machine, so as to allow the goods to be
sewn freely to pass underneath. This had to be
accomplished without increasing the weight of the
machine. In fact, the Beale runs with wonderful
ease and rapidity. It is almost silent, all clicking
sounds having been obviated. As is well known,
a good test of the finish of any mechanism is its
silence when in rapid motion.
With the Wonderful Beale Machine,
whether for hand or foot use, you can hem any
width, make double seams or fells, braid stitch
with chenille, Berlin wool, or gold cord, and such
like fancy work; you may make a pretty lace
stitch, tuck ever so finely, bind dresses, coats, or
carpets ; sew on trimmings without guiding, make
frilling, ruffling, or niching; quilt, weave your
own braid with any combination of colours and
stitch it on at the same time ; make thick, ivoollen
door-mats, embroidered antimacassars, window
curtains, and so forth ; you can easily and rapidly
perform the fashionable shirring or gathering so
popular for sleeves, bodies, or skirts of dresses
with an appliance supplied gratis ; lay the small
cords in hoods and stays ; do large cording ; gather
with or without a band, and generally do all
kinds of straight sewing upon any material what-
ever. You can darn upon any woven goods, and
do crewel-work. The Beale Patent will pass
from eight folds of tweed or twenty of calico to
two of thinnest muslin, or even mosquito-net or
tulle, without the operator changing needle,
cotton, stitch, or tension, and the fine material
will not be gathered in the slightest. You may
make button and eyelet-holes, do over-casting,
make herring-bone stitch upon any materials.
This work is absolutely unique and can only be
accomplished upon the Beale Patent Machine.
Any of these performances will be shown at our
shops at any time. The Beale Patent makes
a lock-stitch, which cannot ravel, yet by a momen-
tary alteration the sewing can be done so as to
rip from end to end, if desired. This peculiarity
is sometimes useful when children’s clothes are
intended to be altered.
Nickel-plating'. —ln our climate the exposed
parts of the machine, and the applicances, need
to be protected from rust. We have, at consider-
able expense, added a handsomely nickeled wheel,
nickeled plates, screws, appliances, treadle-bar
and cones. Heightening the appearance, these
improvements also tend largely to preserve the
parts. This plating is imperishable.
A special feature of The Beale Machine is
that
ALL THE CABINET WORK *
is made at our factory in Sydney from registered
designs, and of the choicest
AUSTRALIAN WOODS,
some of which are without doubt the most beauti-
ful in the world. Suitability to the climate is
thus insured, and we are enabled to offer a greater
variety of styles, most handsome in design and
conveniently fitted for all the requirements of a
lady’s work-table.
These machines can be inspected at any time at
our principal show-rooms in Sydney, or at any of
our suburban and country branch shops, or from
travellers who are continually visiting all parts.
All the machines may be had upon easy time-
payment, or for cash less three shillings in the
pound.

The Most Useful Ointment in the World,
Bar None.
PREMIER OINTMENT is the SOUTHERN
HEMISPHERE. But, as many new arrivals
have lately made New South Wales their home, it
may be as well to let them know that there is such
an : rtiole as JOSEPHSON’S OINTMENT purely
the prod action of thecolony, composed ofwildplants
indigenous to the country and nowhere else, the
principal of which is the EUCALYPTUS, now
so famed thoroughout the world.
t Josephson’s Ointment is purely vegetable, and
GUARANTEED FbEE FROM AIL POISONOUS
Qualities. No Abtificial Colouring, as the
Green colour is extracted from the pure green
plants, which defy imitation.
WHO SHOULD SUFFER FROM PILES,
when one application will relieve you?
Read this letter and Try for Yourselves
Messrs. E. Row and Co.
Dear Sirs, —I have tried your Jo.-ephson’s Oint-
ment for Piles, and have found much relief from
using it. You are at liberty to use this if you feel
disposed.

STUDY HEALTH BY TAKING ROW’S
STEANE’S BITTERS.
The great demand throughout the colony for
these pure Bitters shows they are superior to all
others and equalled by none.
Facts Speak Louder than Words.
Read this sworn testimony from a well-known
citizen :
Statutory Declaration.
. “I» George Hewett, do hereby solemly and
sincerely declare as follows
That I feel it a duty I owe to the public to
state that I have been suffering for many years
from weakness of the stomach, so called INDI-
GESTION or DYSPEPSIA, and have been cured
by my taking two or three glasses of ROW’S
STEANE’S BITTERS a day in a little water, and
I hope others suffering from the same complaint
will be as speedily cured.
“(Signed) G. HEWETT,
“ 215 Pitt-street.
Row’s Steane’s Wine
Is a safe and sure stimulant for the female sex or
children, for it raises and strengthens depressed
systems without producing a temporary excite-
ment to be followed by greater depression.
Persons suffering from loss of appetite and
general depression of spirits cannot do better than
take
ROW’S STEANE’S WINE.
It cannot harm you, but must do good to all
delicate persons. Young Ladies can take this
when suffering from general debility. It’s only a
pure tonic. Try it.
I eetotallers will find this newly-invented
TONIC answer all the purposes of a stimulant
without its intoxicating quality. It will satisfy
the cravings of nature and create a desire for food
instead of drink. As an anti-febrile is unsur-
passed.
ROW’S
DANDELION
BITTERS,
We recoramed • these BITTERS to be taken
two or three times a day; a wineglassful for an
adult, smaller quantity for children.
For General Debility, Dyspepsia, Rheumatism,
and Cutaneous Affections.
The action of dandelion, more especially upon
the liver and kidneys, in more reliable for remov-
ing all impure secretions than any other medicinal
plant known.
x’ersons suffering from Skin diseases will find
these Bitters invaluable.
DIRECTIONS FOR USE.
One wineglass two or three times a day after
meals diluted with same quantity of water. For
young people about half the quantity twice a day.
They Purify the Blood and Liver.
See what a Medical Gentleman says
about them.
Messrs. E. Row and Co.
With thanks for forwarding me a bottle of your
Row’s Dandelion Bitters, and consider them most
excellent, and superior to many others that I have
previously tried. Yours faithfully, HENRY
CHARLES CURTIS, M.R.C.S., England.
Port Adelade, October 30, 1886.
Read an expression of thankfulness received
from the undersigned ;
“I have for many years been obliged to take
medicines, of different kinds for affections of the
liver, indigestion, pain in* the chest, general de-
bility, feeling of nervousness, weariness, great
depression of spirits, and so on, but all without
producing any beneficial effect, till at last, being
recommended to try ROW’S DANDELION
BITTERS, which, happily, I find has produced
an unexpected and wonderful effect and change
in my system, and has removed from my mind
the horrible depressed feeling and former con-
dition of bodily ailment I have so unhappily ex-
perienced for so many years.
“ I am glad of the opportunity to make known
the excellent qualities of ROW'S DANDELION
BITTERS, that those who are afflcted as I have
been may take advantage of them.
“ I remain, dear sirs,

the earthquake did serious injury to property, he ought

cate its only tangible security tw'ice over—to borrow' up
to the hilt for ordinary improvements on the security of

‘ Culloden Moor ’: We showed your letter to the author
Of the “Cast-Iron Canvasser.” He is grateful for the
compliments, but avers you err as to the genealogy of
the clan Macpherson. You say that an ancestor of the
clan was the first land-boomer, inasmuch as the late
lamented Abraham bought an allotment from one Mae-
phelah. And you claim that Macphelah was the ancestor
of the Macphersons. This is not so. Macphelah was the
ancestor of the Macphails, and that clan has been
addicted to building-societies and time-payment allot-
ments ever since. The Macphersons are descended from
Phershon, or Fhairshon, a red-headed savage who
flourished a club about the year 15 B.C. You may read
in the Bon Gaultier ballads how
That was the kind of ancestor the Macphersons are
descended from ‘Childe Harold’: Not suitable
‘Adam Bert’; There is an incident in “The Platelayer,”
but you lose the thread of it in a mixture of personalities.
Both the hero and the poet use the first personal pro-
noun, and it would take another poem to get them
untied ‘W. T. Diverall’: Thanks, but did it never
occur to you that there was a physiological side to the
question of drunkenness as well as an ethical one? Some
peoples produce goitre and cretinism. The fierce, tough
and hardy nations shed a lot of waste matter in hard
drinking. It is a question of race and a question of
development, and one cannot approach the matter purely
from the vulgar, ignorant, unphilosophical “teetotal”
standpoint. Moreover, if people must drink, it is far
better for them to drink Australian wine than Scotch
whisky. We consider your moral North of Tweed tone
rather amusing. Your claim for sobriety for the sons of
Caledonia stern and wild over pure-bred Australians is
not borne out by facts. The hardest drinkers we have
ever met in Australia, or anywhere else, have been from
Aberdeen awa’ and thereaboots. [Many replies held over.]
Tone up the system and improve the appetite
by taking Ayer’s Sarsaparilla. It will make you
feel like a new person. Thousands have found
health by the use of this great blood-purifier,
when all other means failed.
Royalty has its drawbacks in some families,
especially for women. The Duchess of Albany is
compelled to maintain a minor state of eminence
in grief by still wearing mourning for the poor
young man who died years ago of his first spree.
And mourning doesn’t suit the Duchess.
St. Joseph’s Building Society, Sydney, is
in difficulties, owing to the financial panic. It
holds deposits to the extent of nearly .£286,000,
and is liable, in all, for about £331,000. Despite
the suspicious circumstance that it is carried on
under the aegis of a saint, it is apparently a very
sound affair, for it seems, unlike most other
societies, to have undertaken no land-speculation.
The assets are set down as £469,000.
As a hair dressing and renovator, Ayer’s Hair
Vigor is universally commended. It eradicates
dandruff, cures eruptions of the scalp, invigorates
and beautifies the hair and prevents its fading or
turning gray.
“ Fhairshon swore a feud
Against the clan Mactavish
And marched into their land
To murder and to ravish ;
For he had stoutly sworn
To extirpate the vipers
With four-and-twenty men
And five-and-thirty pipers.”
DIED FROM STARVATION
According to a London newspaper, the official
list of persons starved to deatli by the community
in London last year showed a total of 31 persons,
who it was found had succumbed to the awful
pangs of hunger. “Of course,” remarks the same
authority, “the actual number is much higher!”
What a shocking commentary on the boasted
civilisation of the 19th century ! These 31 persons
had been found mostly in the streets, dead, where,
homeless and friendless, after being relentlessly
pursued for weeks and months by the grim
spectre, they finally sank down, worn out with
the struggle for existence, and found welcome
release in responding to the inexorable demand to
cross the mysterious bourne of the great hereafter.
Man’s inhumanity to man has a terrible indict-
ment to answer. Prodigality, both in high life
and in humble life, is too widespread for its bane-
ful effects on mankind generally to be negatived,
even by the noblest endeavours of the world s
philanthropists. Amongst those who have done
much towards the amelioration of human misery,
none have a stronger claim upon the gratitude of
the sick and suffering than the proprietors of that
giant arch-enemy of pain, St. Jacobs Oil, the
introduction of which into Australia, has _ been
attended by the most distinguished results in the
cure of every description of nervous and mus
eular disease. The simplicity of its application,
the fact that it may be procured of any res-
pectable druggist or storekeeper, and the rapidity
of its operation in giving relief from and
ultimately banishing such ailments as sciatica,
gout, neuralgia, rheumatism, backache, sprains,
chest affection, sore throat, &c., gives it pre
eminence over all other patent medicines foi
external application. Mrs. M. Calvert, Myrtle-
street, Darlington, gratefully acknowledges: “I
have suffered a great deal from rheumatics in my
hands and shoulders, and have found nothing but
St. Jacobs Oil to do me any good. It is a
splendid remedy, and I, for one, have good
reason to be thankful for it.’"

A CURIOUS CLOCK.
In the front hall of Mr. Darius L. Goff, of
Rhode Island, U.S.A., stands a tall, old-fashioned
clock, an heirloom, that never runs down. It
stands near the front door, and is connected with
it by a rod, with gearing attachments. Whenever
the door is opened or closed the winding arrange-
ments are given a turn, so that the act of entering
or leaving the house keeps the clock constantly
wound. By means of electrical appliances,
operated by'the clock in its movements, the gas
jet in the hall is raised at dusk and lowered at
bedtime, an early-rising bell is rung to summon
the family from their repose, and still an hour
later the clock rings the breakfast bell. When-
ever it strikes the hour, musical cathedral chimes
are struck simultaneously in the chambers, and
for a moment the house is tilled with melody. Of
course the possession of an horological curiosity of
this kind is only possible to a very wealthy man,
and would be not only useless but a perfect white
elephant to a poor one. What every man does
require, however, is a thoroughly reliable and
cheap pocket timepiece, and thanks to the untiring
perseverance of the Waterbury Watch 00. this
want has been amply filled—thousands of people
of every grade of life testifying to the marvellous
timekeeping abilities of these world-renowned
watches. *

WHAT CURES PIMPLES
/f>
ft*
&
The only really successful prevent-
ive and. cure of pimples, blotches,
blackheads, red, rough, and oily skin,
most complexional disfigurations,
is that greatest of all Skin Purifiers
and Beautifiers, the celebrated Cuti-
CURA Soap. For irritating and scaly
humors of the scalp, with dry or fall-
ing hair, red, rough hands, chaps,
painful finger ends with shapeless
nails, and simple humors of the skin
and scalp of infancy and childhood, it
is simply infallible.
CUTICURA SOAP
A marvellous beautifier of world-wide celebrity, Cuticura Soap is simply incom-
parable as a Skin-Purifying Soap, unequalled for the Toilet, and without a rival for
the Nursery. Absolutely pure, delicately medicated, exquisitely perfumed, it produces
the whitest, clearest skin, and softest hands, and prevents inflammation and clogging
of the pores, the cause of pimples, blotches, blackheads, red and oily skin, and most
complexional disfigurations.- It derives its remarkable medicinal properties from
Cuticura, the great skin cure, but so delicately are they blended with the purest of
toilet and nursery soap stocks that the result is a medicated toilet soap incomparably
superior to all other skin and complexion soaps, while rivalling in delicacy and sur-
passing in purity the most noted and expensive of toilet and nursery soaps. For the
prevention of facial blemishes, for giving a brilliancy and freshness to the com-
plexion, and for cleansing the scalp and invigorating the hair, it is without a peer.
Sale greater than the combined sales of all other skin soaps. Sold everywhere. 25c.

The Cost of Pleasure.
Many a drama played in the city streets would
awaken in us a deeper interest, would touch us
with a greater significance, could we but know
something of the actors therein, than all the his-
trionic triumphs of the stage; where vice is but
assumed for an evening, squalor depicted by clean
rags, and misery put on like a garment.
The following incident holds within itself the
nucleus of a novel, or the crowning incident of a
pl a y> yet it is but a chapter from real life.
The winter dusk was creeping over the streets,
tjie early afternoon was closing in, and the scene
was a big station, a brilliantly-illuminated London
terminus, at the gates of which flowed the restless
human tide.
A woman, richly dressed, quite alone, was list-
lessly walking along the station platform. Many
as they hurried by glanced at her, some looked
back, two gentlemen standing together smiled
slightly, but none stayed to speak. What was
she - her rouged cheeks, the glamour of darkened
eyelids, as well as a certain unnecessary richness
of dress told the ordinary man of the world.
What she had been was another matter—a knovv-
ledge hard to attain, perhaps, since one scandal in
high life so quickly buries another out of sight
nowadays.
She was walking slowly down the long platform,
her beautiful insolent eyes carelessly sweeping the
groups of men that she passed—a modern Lamia
m the Modern Babylon. In the old classical
story Lamia sits by the wayside and woos men
with her silver tongue and visible witcheries;
to day Lamia is curtailed her ancient privileges,
and has thereby learned to put a first entreaty in
her eyes. .
The station was crowded, especially at the lower
end, where expectant groups waited. All at once
the woman whitened to her very lips.
“ Godfrey ! ”
The cry was seemingly wrung from her, and,
though uttered in a low tone, reached the ears of
the one for whom it was intended ; for he turned
and faced her, a man with a handsome, stern face,
whose hand was held by a little child of tender
years, a child of that typical .English beauty we
are wont to associate with serenely blue eyes and
“ hair like the thistledown tinted with gold,” as a
now-dead poet once expressed it. The gentleman
and child had just entered by the booking-office
entrance, and were strolling toward the arrival
platform.
Only this once,” pleaded the woman, arresting
his steps. Ihe defiant beauty of her face had
softened; her eyes were pitiful, her manner full
of supplication.
The gentleman thus accosted drew a little
aside out of the glare of the bright bookstall
lamps, looked steadily at the woman a moment,
and then briefly said :
“You may speak to her.”
“We have come,” said the little girl with
childish confidence, and speaking in a restrained
flutter of excitement to the tall stranger, who
bent with tender gesture toward her, “to meet
my mamma. ”
The woman paled beneath her paint, and though
smilmg lips moved, no sound issued.
“ Not my own mamma,” explained the child;
she died long ago. ”
“Yes,” assented the woman gently; “it is
long ago. Do you remember her ?”
I think I do, a little,’’she replied. “She was
like you,” continued the child with artless
sincerity ; “only she had not such pink cheeks.”
ihe woman shrank as if from a blow, and
involuntarily turned her face from the light.
, have come to meet your mamma, you
said; do you love this mamma very much ?”
Yes, ’ and then a sense of wistfulness grew
upon the childish face; “ but I used to love my
very own mamma the best.”
With a sudden gesture of grief and devotion she
bent her head to kiss the rose lips of the child,
and then as suddenly stopped and drew back. A
cruel consciousness of whose lips had pressed her’s
last—and whose might touch them again ! It was
a moment of expiation and sacrifice, a possibly
strained sense of profanation that held that poor
Lamia back from the purity of those childish lips.
God help her ; it was a sacrifice the Recording
Angel might well have accepted as a remission for
many sins.
The train was thundering in as the man, with a
touch of impatience, made a movement.
“ Good-bye,” cried the child, and turned to her
father.
i Vh / 'Y as she crying, papa?” and the little
child, clinging to the man’s stalwart arm, looked
up into his face, and then seeing tears trembling
m his eyes clung the tighter to his hand, awed by
so unusual an occurrence,
“Hush, dear!” he replied in a whisper, and
then skilfully piloted her past the hurrying
passengers and laden trucks, away to where the
bustle of the new arrivals made the throng the
thickest.
A moment later he was standing by the side of
a sweet-faced woman, whom he tenderly kissed
with the simple assurance, “ I have missed you
so much.”
“ And you, my darling,” bending down a happy
face conscious of blushes, “have you missed me,
too ?” arranging, with a woman’s sense of taste,
the child’s hat more becomingly.
“Yes, mamma, and papa said, when you went
away again, you must take us with you.”
The young stepmother smoothed the golden
curls and kissed the little eager face, ere she lifted
her own, bright with pleasurable emotions, to the
grave man by her side, reading in his tender eyes
the trust his heart reposed in her.
Out in the brilliant moonlight they went, into
the midst of the gaily-lit streets, hand in arm, lost
in the throng of humanity. Only from the
friendly shadow of the station bookstall had
Lamia seen it all, that picture of what might have
been, that kiss of welcome to those lips hers had
not dared to touch.
The cold moon shone with no inspiriting
brilliance for her ; all she saw in the streets were
tired men and women, ever plunging forward with
the pain in their faces that she felt in her heart of
hearts.-

OPINIONS OF THE PRESS
Proving the Wonderful Cures to be Genuine.
—
“ Herr Rassmussen’s World-famed Denmark Universal Pills are
purely Herbal, and is the best remedy in the world for curing and
preventing disease.”— The Times.
“ Herr Rassmussen’s, the Celebrated Danish Herbalist, well-
known Herbal Remedies have been the means of performing many
great cures during the last few years, as his numerous testi-
monials will prove.”— Sydney Bulletin.
“ Herr R assmussen has shown us some highly complimentary
Testimonials which he has received, certifying to important
cures effected by his Remedies.” — Sydney Evening News.
“ We have been shown some excellent Testimonials of the
great cures performed by Herr Rassmussen, the Celebrated
Danish Herbalist. Herr Rassmussen is a gentleman who has
gained for himself a reputation in the medical world of herbal
science. He has been practising as a qualified herbalist so long in
Sydney that his name has become known throughout New South
Wales and Australia.” — Australian Star.
“ We are continually receiving letters from Here Rassmussen’s
Cured Patients, requesting us to make known the wonderful
virtues his world-renowned Herbal Remedies contain.”—
Sydney Weekly News.
“ Herr Rassmussen’s name has become a household word
throughout the Southern Hemisphere. He was presented with a
magnificent Gold Medal for some of his marvellous cures.”—
Balmain Leader.
“Herr Rassmussen is too well and favourably known to the
Australian public to require auy additional praise from ‘ Truth.*
His Herbal Remedies are unequalled.”— Sydney Truth.
“ The remarkable Cures effected by Herr Rassmussen’s Herbal
Remedies are pretty generally known.”— Balmain Observer.
“Herr Rassmussen, we are glad to say, as a Medical Herbalist,
holds the highest place in the Colonies, and enjoys the confidence of
many of the leading people in N.S. Wales, Victoria, and Queens-
land."— Cooktown Courier, Queensland,
•‘Herr Rassmussen counts his cures by thousands, has already
acquired an Australian Reputation, and has secured the respect
and gratitude of numerous patients whom his remedies has
restored to Health and Happiness.”— Centennial History
of N.S.W.
“Herr Rassmussen’s Remedies have cured more diseases thau
all the other remedies put together.”— Republican,
“Who have not heard of the numerous Cures effected by Herr
Rassmussen’s Denmark U niversal Pills.”—A ust ralianFriend.
“ All the principal Analysts and Medical Experts have proclaimed
Herr Rassmussen's Denmark Universal Pills to be the best nr
the world.”— Medical Herbalist Journal.
“Herr Rassmussen is a skilled botanist.” — Launceston
Daily Telegraph, Tasmania.
“It may not he out of place to mention that Hrrr Rassmussen
has now been established in the colonies for nearly 10 years.”—
Sydney Sunday Times.
“ Herr Rassmussen is no doubt one of the most successful
Medical Practitioners in these colonies, judging from his enormous
practice and his wonderful cures, and his great skill has been
recognised in many ways. He has also been rewarded with a
magnificent Gold Medal for effecting wonderful cures ” — Syd ney
Freedom.
A REAL MAH' OF MARK.
“ Herr Rassmussen’s Cures are so remarkable that we make no
apology for referring to some of them. Mr. Ramsden’s case is the
most wonderful, and he cured him in six weeks, after all the
Sydney doctors gave him up. We may also state that a gentleman
in this district, who has been a martyr to the demon Dyspepsia for
more than two years, after trying several “doctors” with no
benefit whatever, is recovering under Herb Rassmussen’s Herbal
Treatment. In this age of unblushing quackery it is well to find
a man of Herr Rassmussen’s undoubted skill, and we wish him .a
long life to continue his useful mission in the cause of suffering
humanity.”— Kangaroo Valley Pioneer, N S.W.
A JUST REWARD.
Herr Rassmussen, of whose Famous Herbal Remedies everybody
has heard, is yet a youug man, and has held the position of Lecturer
to several Botanic Societies in Australia; he soon became known by
his wonderful cures of which he has numerous tokens of grateful,
ness, including a beautiful Gold Medal, brought him into the front
rank of Botanic Scientists ; now he is the Proprietor and Discoverer
of the famous Denmark Herbal Remedies, all of which have
secured the honest support of the people, not only of Australia,
but Africa, the United States, the British Kingdom and Italy.
It is not for us to enumerate the various remedies prepared by this
really learned man, hut having seen and examined letters from all
parts of the world, we are assured that he has saved a world of
suffering and cured people of many complaints, after they had
given up all hope.”— The Australian Workman.— Sydney,
January 9 th, 1892.

SPORTING NOTIONS.
Of the first England v. Australia match it was
remarked in The Bulletin that, but for a Sharpe spasm
of fine bow ling the Australians would have made a long
score in their first innings, and again—" Evidently, how-
ever, the English team is not as good as was at first sup-
posed, and after seeing them knock balls into the air just
when safety hits were most necessary one is disposed to
think that some of them can't be cautious. Moreover, the
old bowlers have lost their dash.” This estimate looks
fairly correct now' that the Britishers have been downed
a second time. Grace’s boast that he had brought the
strongest combination that ever crossed the seas didn’t
quite “ wash ” at the outset, not with anyone who
remembered the strength and pluck of Shaw and Shrews-
bury's two professional elevens. Neither Briggs, Peel,
Read, nor Attewell is quite as good a man now as he was
a few years back, Lohmann is no better, Sharpe and Bean
are not nearly so uniformly useful as Barnes and Bates,
Sherwin compared favourably with M‘Gregor, and Shrews-
bury and Gunn were more certain run-getters than Grace
and Stoddart. Even Flowers, taking his bowling into
consideration, was not much behind Abel, for a better-
nerved player “ on the pinch” never held his wicket up.
However, the exact relative merits of past and present
teams ot such good calibre must remain a matter of
opinion, anyway. One thing is clear. Grace and Co.
couldn’t get nine Australian batsmen out for less than
390 runs, which fact alone disposes of the supposition
that they had a bit up their sleeves, and could win when
they Wanted to. Had they just won, as with better
generalship they might have managed to do, there must
have remained the fact that Tweedledum was much the
same as Tw’eedledee. The Englishmen certainly appear
to perform with rather more of practised ease than
their opponents, hut they have lost two fairly fought
matches. Jack Kangaroo is as good as John Bull,
or better. The moral of these contests is that the
science of cricket doesn’t extend very far, and no
amount of experience can teach men how to find a way
of compelling the game to be always lively. Lord
Sheffield’s mission was to make Australian cricket more
interesting, and Ids ludship must confess that he has
failed miserably. John Roberts can come over and
demonstrate that billiard players who don’t score a cer-
tain number of points in an hour must inevitably get left
in the lurch, but the English cricketers have proved
themselves Unable to beat Bannerman’s tactics. A recent
article in Blackwood's Magazine is worth quoting
from in this connection. Referring to W. G. Grace’s
query “ How' if there were a Scotton at both ends? ”
tne writer adds:—“We may carry this awful possi-
bility a step farther, and ask how 7 , if there were an
eleven of Scottons, or Louis Halls, or Barlows, or even
Shrewsbury's, when Shrewsbury is playing a defensive
game? It is perfectly clear that if there was such an
eleven (which Heaven forbid !), and it was once in, it
would remain in for ever; for the bowler has not yet been
horn who could separate such a bundle of ‘ sticks.’ ”
Bannerman, without a doubt, is responsible for the down-
fall of All England in both instances, consequently any
Australian cricketer w-ho aspires to save his country had
better cultivate “ a grand defence.” If one stonew'aller
(a favourite Australian apology for Bannerman) is good in
a team, then two stonewallers in the other team would be
better. And so the argument can be extended. If
cricket, international or local, be played without regard
for the public, who want amusement, and the game
degenerates into a trial of endurance, what busy man will
give time and money to support it?
* # «
Grace made an inexplicable mistake in risking
the slaughter of his best batsmen at Sydney on the Tues-
day afternoon, when there was no opportunity for them
to “ break the bowling and practically no hope of their
making many runs. The three last Australians had been
disposed of by three successive balls, and how VV.G. could
imagine that he and his brother “ cracks ” would be more
at home on such a wicket and in such a light, is one of
those things that only an almighty Britisher can under-
stand. Peel and Attewell were quite good enough to
send in first under such circumstances, with instructions
to take as long as possible in getting out. The obviously
right policy was to potter against the clock and trust in
Providence for a better pitch next morning. If the
ground wasn’t going to improve there was no earthly
chance of winning anyway, so Grace had no sensible pur-
pose to serve in not reserving the flowers of his flock and
giving them the benefit of a doubt as regards the weather.
Abel, Bean, and W.G. made 10 runs between them.
Walter Giffen, for the Australians, had made 3 before
Briggs did the “hat-trick,” so six wickets in all fell for
13 runs.
• * «
W. G. Grace should add this autobiographical
story to his book on cricket. It was the second test
match—England v. Australia. Lyons was batting—his
left foot outside the crease, his right foot and bat within
it. A ball struck the batsman on the right kneecap and
flew towards W. Q. The pain consequent on the blow 7
caused Lyons to raise his right foot and bat off the ground,
and while balancing himself on his left foot (which, of
course, was outside the crease) he began rubbing the sore
place. While the temporarily-crippled batsman was thus
engaged, the Great Champion, W.G., perceived that the
left foot was beyond the crease, so he flung the ball at
Lyons’ wicket, hut fortunately missed it. Talk about
sharp practice !
# # #
Grace has made himself popular in Australia to
this extent: that the public like to see him take his nlace
at the wicket—and get bowled for one or less.
» « *
Dr. W. G. Grace has at last been drawn into
making a fresh formal denial that he ever wrote the
celebrated letter attributed to him, first published many
years ago, abusing Australia and Australians. As The
Bulletin has repeatedly said, the letter in question was
concocted as “a Joke” by the late Richard Egan Lee,
Jun., of Melbourne. on Grace’s departure from Australia
after his first visit many years ago.
* # •
This is an unhealthy year for champions. For
many months past alleged champion bruiser Johnel has
kept his title by skilfully running away from Slavin ; and
now alleged champion sculler Stanbury seems to have
been keeping his dignity by vigorously dodging Sullivan,
of Maoriland. Also, the champion cricketer, Grace, is
being badly licked, and the champion business is getting
\ ery low down generally. The average*champion now-a-
days won’t champ worth a cent., and he has an alleged
hacker who won’t back him, and the only thing that
cither of them is good for is to gas in bars and tobacco-
shops.
* * *
The Australian Eleven are emphatic in declar-
ing that they lose money by playing cricket. Blackham
sajs he wants to get away from cricket if he can, but the
mere suggestion of his secession has brought both Grace
and Lord Sheffield down on him with persuasions to play
on. Grace and Lord Sheffield (this is our own remark)
are probably most anxious also that Lyons and Banner-
man should play in the next “ test” triumph.
# # •
It is useless for the Melbournites to try and get
the third best match with Lord Sheffield’s team fixed for
Melbourne. Before playing in Melbourne in the first
match, Giffen and Lyons made it a condition that the
final match was to be played in Adelaide. Then the
V.C.A. people, frightened that Giffen and Lyons would
not play, went to Sheffield and he guaranteed that the
match should be fixed for S.A. Secretary Gresswell, of
S. A.C. Association, wrote to Sheffield for his signature to
a bond. Sheffield replied promptly, saying, “My word
is my bond. The third match will be played in
Adelaide.”
# • #
“The evil that men do lives after them” —
apropos poor Dick Lee and VV. G. Grace. Dick, the living
skeleton, took an inexplicable down on the big Doctor,
and astonished Melbourne with an account of how the
English oricketers swilled beer out of a tin bucket in the
M.C.C. pavilion. Dick w'as the man w'ho would start with
6d. for a lounge from Melbourne to Sydney.
* # #
It is estimated that Lord Sheffield’s team will
receive in gross about £13,000 as the result of the present
tour; nearly £9OOO is in hand already. Sheffield, on
account of his profuse liberality, will probably lose a
little on the whole programme.
• # *
Richardson should yet make a big star in the
boxing world. On Saturday night he defeated Jackson’s
old heavy-weight opponent, Frank Pablo, in seven
rounds-a remarkable feat for a middle-weight novice.
There is seemingly little of the novice about him, for he
is a remarkably cool fellow', yet we learn that he has
received but very little tuition. He is one of those lanky
Cornstalks who have revolutionised middle-weight fight-
ing—in fact, he reminds one of Fitzsimmons, on account
of his tremendous reach and quickness in getting away ;
at outfighting he is a demon. He can use the right at
close quarters, and his ducking for so tall a in an is
wonderful. In the absence of Hall and Fitzsimmons,
Richardson should now be equal to any middle-w'eight in
Australia.
When slightly “ tonicked ”a man should not be
too eager to act as referee and timekeeper at a boxing
contest.

first and second horses, in the case of a close finish, is not
likely to be approved by the betting public. Mr. Benson
did not place a third horse for the Park Stakes on Satur-
day, and in a recent race at Canterbury the holder of a
horse in a big Tattersall’s sweep had the chagrin to see
his horse run third without being so placed by the judge.
If such a thing happened to the writer he would certainly
kill the judge, or himself—perhaps both.

The small sport who takes a situation to train
a huge, over-grown, cantankerous pugilist has a heavy
boulder to lift. One of the tribe tells his story in an
English paper. He was training an immense, drunken
rowdy for a match and had abundant hopes—if he could
only keep his rowdy sober. So he took him to train in a
lonely region among the English lakes, where there was
only one public-house in 20 miles or so, and so long as he
kept the pug. away from that solitary grog mansion all
was well. But one day, when they were out doing a long
spin, the bruiser insisted on going home vid the public-
house, and when he reached it he sat down and announced
in a burst of flaming language that he was tired of sob-
riety, and intended to be drunk for a week and take his
chance. The trainer remonstrated and was informed that
he must either keep quiet or get his head punched.
Then the small man, having a large sum of money at
stake, took a desperate seep. He could run like a deer,
and relying on that fact he promptly banged his pugilist
on the head with the nearest brick, and fled for his life.
The pug. didn’t stop to have a single drink; he just
gathered up his vast limbs, swore horribly, and started in
pursuit. They spurted along for nearly five miles, the
trainer just keeping far enough, ahead to make his
follower believe that he would catch him at the next
corner. At the end of that distance the fighting man
reluctantly gave it up ; he sat down to cool for a while,
and then turned to walk back with a dogged determina-
tion to have his spree despite all obstacles. It was at this
point of the game that the trainer played his great card ;
he ran after the retreatingpug., and, from a safe distance,
banged him on the head with another brick. Then they
both galloped straight home, and by the time they got
there, the big man was ten miles away from his beer, and
too exhausted either to walk back for it or to lick his
enemy. So they made peace, and the great drunk was
indefinitely postponed.

The name of Glassey, M.L.A., is omitted

Such petty evidence of spleen could hardly be
expected from a Cabinet Minister, even of the
Tozer type.
The Brisbane Municipal elections, mor e
especially in the Valley electorate, were a contest
between the Capitalists and the Labour-party,
but although the former won, it is no criterion of
the result of the Parliamentary elections, as apart
from the comparatively large number of plural
votes on a Municipal roll, the working man is not
blessed with city property.

A new murder epidemic has started in
Sydney. McGrow began it; he killed his wife,
and said it arose from jealousy. Then a youth
named Kirby made a serious effort to kill his
mother, and he also said it arose through jealousy.
Next, we presume, somebody will brain his
grandfather, and say that that was owing to
jealousy. And after that the explanation will be
kept standing in type, so to speak, and a blood-
stained person with a wild eye and a dripping axe
and brains on the edge of the axe will simply
walk into the detective office, and stand the gory
weapon up in the corner, and say in a weary tone
of voice: “Ditto.” Then it will appear in the
evening papers in big, fat letters: “ Horrid
Butchery arising from Ditto.”
Brisbane has brilliantly emulated its
southern neighbours by bringing to grief its
strongest deposit bank and building society,
which has suspended payment. The Queensland
Deposit Bank and Building Society claims to
show an excess of assets over liabilities of £94,924,
but, as a large proportion of the assets consist of
landed property, and as land in and around
Brisbane is just about as saleable as floating ice-
bergs in the Antarctic Ocean, this excess is not a
liquid one, and must be heavily discounted.
Stated assets, £317,555; liabilities, £222,031.
The assets include the bank premises, £30,000,
and landed property separately indicated, £75,000,
But further land transactions lie concealed in the
general statement—“ bills receivable, bills dis-
counted, borrowers’ balances, land purchases, and
temporary advances, about £200,000.” As every
second borrower in Brisbane is practically insol-
vent, this looks as healthy as a consumptive in
the flush of decline. Of course, the promoters
were all men of honor and experience, and equally
of course one or two cantankerous depositors are
pressing the Supreme Court for a compulsory
liquidation.
Item from the report of the “Christian
Convention ” meeting at Launceston (Tasmania) :
Pastor Soltau said he had now full demonstration of the
power of God to answer prayer. He knew He could do
so, but he doubted somewhat if He would heed his (Mr.
Soltau’s) little appeals. However, he was thankful to say
that He had given him a direct and practical answer, for
on last Sunday night week he prayed to the Almighty
specially to send an earthquake upon Launceston so that
the inhabitants would be shaken so that they would
realise their peril. In His own good time and during the
very week the Convention were holding their meetings,
his request had been granted, and he thanked God for it.
The usual prayer-meeting brought the mission to a close.
We mention this so that if convulsions of the
earth’s crust become too frequent the people will
know whom to hang. Pastor Soltau is evidently,
by hrs own sho'wing, the cause of earthquakes,
and either they have got to stop or Soltau “goes
up.” Supposing this should prove an earthquaky
season in Australia,- we would advise that preacher
to bolt in disguise through a back window. If
he doesn’t, an infuriated mob may be busy
some day bobbing him up and down aUthe end of
a rope, and every time he drops dowirthey will
ask him ,if he is going to stop that earthquake,
and every time he says he can’t do it he’ll be
jerked up again. Soltau scoffs at the doctrine of
transubstantiation and the real presence, but
gravely claims to have such influence with the
Deity as to persuade it to rock the earth
gently, smash some crockery, and upset the
stomachs of the just and unjust alike—perhaps, as
Mrs. Gamp would say, “ proticipating many
interesting events” —merely to.terrorise a few
backsliding Particular Baptists, and' stimulate
their oblations. If, however, Soltau will induce
another earthquake after giving due notice of his
prayerful intent, he may be sure of a wider and
more lucrative field than Tasmania. R. S. Smythe
would boom him in opposition to any show
on earth, so he had better keep his hand
in. By the way, another man who ought to
light out for a place of safety this year is the
proprietor of Whitaker’s Almanac (London).
He announces:—
In consequence of the indisposition of the editor, and
the sudden death of his sub-editor and chief assistant,
Whitaker’s Almanac will not be issued before the 21st
instant. Arrangements have already been made to pre-
vent any repetition of such an occurrence.
Now, it is all very good for the Whitaker man to
arrange to prevent the repetition of the death of
his sub-editor, but if he doesn’t arrange to prevent
our death also we propose to make things very
hot for him.
CARBINE.
(For Tub Bulletin.)
Soft on the sunny slopes of Sylvia Park
A mare reposed—a mare of bluest blood,
Musing and pondering on her ancestors,
And on the deeds they did, and wondered if
Her coming son would prove as great as they.
And when that son had risen, or dropped, or come
To light, Or what you will, and when the world
Had gladly learned that patriarchal Musket
Had added yet another unproved weapon
Unto the Well-filled armoury of his sons,
The learned in horseflesh looked on him and shook
Their sapient heads, and said, “ Ills hocks are bad,”
“ Colour not right,” “ Pedigree shows through lines
Of blue and red ; he will not stay.” But when
They saw the colt what time the silk was up,
Playing for keeps, their note was quickly changed.
And e’en of change but little stayed with them.
So from that time to this Carbine has been
The equine god to whom all Australasians
Offer their prayers and gold, and had the cause
Of Federation haply been a go
No other President would they have wished
Than mighty Carbine.
And still his fame increased with every race
He started for or won, which meant the same,
Until arrived the Cup of ’91
When he should venture though, like Scarpia crushed,
With weight of public gold and XOst. 121b.
To put the final seal on his career
Or set upon his never-equalled fame.
So all the people of these Austral Isles,
From shepherds shivering in Otagon huts
To diver* after pearls ’neath the warm waves
Of Torres’ torrid seas, had raised a bit
To put oh Carbine.
O’er the shuddering wires
A rumollr came saying his legs were eronk,
And backers groaned, mourning departed quids.
And backers grinned, counting their certain gai
Standing on velvet. So the Melbourne Cup
Fell to Malvolio ; and the hero went
To rest in glorious ease, and there beget
Sons mighty as himself. But time rolls on,
The world turns round, and even heroes die ;
And Carbine died, and reverend worshippers
Treasured his bones and hide and hoofs and hair,
And all the sinews of his glorious body
Were boiled to thrice-refinM gelatine’
Such as whereon astronomers are wont
To photograph the starry heavens and show
Worlds at the making. Through the silent night
Unnumbered stars, far beyond human ken,
Grace down their form and history and place
Upon the noble stuff which once gave pith
To Carbine’s mighty legs.

Tales of the Early Days.
No. 1.—Overseer Franke’s Pegging-Out.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
BY PRICE WARUNG.
in beginning the publication of the Fourth Series of
Stories by “Price Waning,” it is thought desirable as a
matter of justice to the proprietors of Tub Bulletin and
to the author, to explicitly state that “Price WaningV
Old-Time Narratives are written for, and appear (unless
pirated) in no other Australasian paper. “ Price
Warning's ” work has elicited in several quarters that form
of flattery which consists of imitation, and at least one of
his imitators has gone to the length of claiming identity
with the original—a pretension which was demolished
upon the publication of the first story from his pen.
Further, it may he stated, that while the writer of The
Bulletin’s “ Tales of the System,” “Tales of Old Sydney,”
“Tales of the Old Regime,” and “Tales of the Early
Days,” has devoted twenty years to studying the history
of Early Australasia, and has formed in that period, an
absolutely-unique collection of MS., no other known story-
writer has devoted a twentieth-part of the time to similar
research. Tested by his acquaintance with the facts of
history and topography, it would seem doubtful, indeed,
if any one such has spent as much time in research as
“ Price Waning ” gave to the preparation of his Index
alone—a work, it may be mentioned, which includes
nearly 300,000 entries—for even so small a proportion of
labour would have prevented the least intelligent scribbler
from falling into the ludicrous errors which have been
perpetrated by recent amateurs in Australogy.—Ed. B.
Overseer Franke, of the Outer Domain
Gang, working on the heights of Woolloomooloo,
and engaged in clearing (by means of convicts’
agony) the wooded ranges of hills and network of
gullies, so as to make room for the perfume-breath-
ing plants of civilisation, had been rudely inter-
rupted in his slumbers. One of the gang, Convict
Cummings, being half-starved, sun-smitten, and
overworked, had become delirious in the mid-
hours of the night, and another transport —Mann
—had set the Regulations at defiance by imploring
the sentry’s aid for the sick wretch, his tent-mate.
Thereupon, Mr. Overseer Franke had awoke from
his beauty-sleep and had ordered the sentry to
still Mann’s rebellious tongue with a bullet. The
sentry fired in Mann’s direction, but the bullet
had found its destined billet in Convict Cum-
mings’ body—and Convict Cummings had ceased
from troubling. Unfortunately, the wicked Mann,
having evaded the shot, did not rest. He up-
braided Overseer Franke for having murdered
Cummings. He became positively insulting—and
was flogged.
At two o’clock in the morning, at a spot some-
where, we take it, about where Liverpool-street
of Modern Sydney dips into Womerah Avenue,
Darlinghurst, Convict Edgar Allison Mann
received.,39 lashes.
And Mann was “ gently-born and when the
back of a gently-born transport had once been
stained with the infamous stigma of the lash-
point, only-two things, if he were not to become
utterly bestial, remained for him to do.: to kill his
tyrant, and —to die.
And Convict Mann, ,being at heart a really fine
fellow—being, moreover, a firm believer in
Shandy’s doctrine that a man’s name influenced
his character ; being, in a word, manly, lost not a
minute in coming to the resolve to do both things.
“ Peel!” had ordered. Overseer Franke.
Mann had obeyed- making a remark as he
did so.
“Flog me, and by God who looks from the
Heaven above, you're a dead man, Mr. Franke !”
And then correcting himself, as though before he
were subjected to the degrading ordeal he would
assert his manhood, he repeated the words, but
dropped the title. “ You’re a dead man, Franke /”
“ Scourger—thirty-nine !” laughed Franke. He
might have made the penalty forty lashes —beyond
forty an overseer could not go-—but he read his
Bible, did Franke—also the Regulations. “Thirty-
nine ” was Scriptural. And it was one on the
safe side of the Regulation allowance.
* * *
All through the next day when the only
living occupants of the camp were the sentry (the
one who had shat Cummings) and himself —
Cummings was, of course, also there, but though
he was a present horror and outrage, he was in
the past tense —Convict Mann nourished himself
upon the lees of his cup of shame. And the
draught turned to the acid of revenge in his
mouth. By the time the gang returned to work
after the nooning repast, he had forgotten, how-
ever, for a brief space, his physical pangs in the
pleasure of anticipation.
He had formed a scheme by which to obtain the
freedom of the gang and his revenge upon Over-
seer Franke.
The one recreation permitted to the gangers
was a rare plunge into the waters of the inlet
since known as Rushcutter’s Bay, which was
granted to them whenever they visited the Bay
for the purpose of renewing the stock of rushes
which composed their beds. The sedge at that
time not only covered densely the low-lying
areas between the arms of the Bay, but ran
out in the inlet itself, and to gain a clear plunge
the convicts were obliged to advance some hun-
dreds of yards from the proper beach-line. More
than one poor devil, having got so far, thought he
would go farther, and had sought to dive and
swim beyond the military guards’ range. If the
soldiers missed, however, there were other and
still more vigilant guards (the sharks), and these
never, so the authorities believed, missed their
man.
On the last occasion, six weeks before, on which
Overseer Franke had thought it desirable to
refresh his “labour” with a bath and with new
bedding, Mann, witli another ganger, going out a
little further than the others, found that a dere-
lict ship’s boat had been tide-borne into the bay,
and had nosed a short way into the spiky sea-
growths. Their hearts had laboured mightily at
the discovery, for the fates would be cruel indeed
if, with such a tool to their hands, they could not
win freedom somehow. They had kept the knowr-
ledge of the boat to themselves. They had driven
the craft with all their might farther into the
sedge, and then had diverted the attention of
their fellow-gangers from the vicinity by raising
the cry of “ A shark ! a shark !” and byretreating
hurriedly from the spot. And all the time that
had intervened, the knowledge of the boat hidden
in the rushes had soothed the ache of the hearts
and hands of the two men. The boat was oar-
less, that was one disadvantage, but they did not
always think of the deficiency. They dwelt upon
what they had, not upon that which they had not.
This day—a Tuesday which Convict Mann
spent in camp, brooding over his shame and his
revenge, he thought less, perhaps, of the boat
than he had done on other days—till the after-
noon. Then, the recollection flashed upon him,
and, all gashed and pain-stricken as he was, he
strove to act upon it. He called the sentry.
“ Sentry ! Can I speak to you ?”
The soldier paused in his wearisome walk by
the tent-mouth.
“ Yes, Mann.”
“Will you do me a favour ?”
“ ’Ef it be’nt agen Keg’lashuns.”
There was a moment’s silence. Then— —
“It’s against the letter of the Regulations, but
not against their spirit. ”
“ I don’t know wot yer mean.”
“ Well—the Regulation is that flogged prisoners
should be turned out to work as soon as possible
after the flogging, isn’t it?”
“Yes.”
“ Then I wish to get better soon—to get about
the quicker. And a dip in the bay’ll heal —the —
back—quickly. The salt is good for it!”
“ No-a ! I’ll not let yez go. Yez ’ud d rounded
yesself !”
“ Sentry, what do they call me in the gang?”
“ Gen’el’man Ned.”
“ Yes, Gentleman Ned! And though I’m lying
here flogged ” —then, for a second, the restraint to
which he was subjecting himself gave way, and he
shivered and sobbed—the wrung agony of a strong
man’s sob! in the impotency of his wrath.
“Though I’m here under punishment, I hope—
I hope—l’m still a gentleman in that I won’t lie.
I’ll come back, sentry, if you allow me to go !’’
“Yez ’ud not get there ef I let yez go, Yez
too sick. ”
“ By Heaven, I would, sentry. My will will
carry me, and back, if I had no other power.”
The soldier—a pock-marked, skimpy-eyebrowed-
and-haired fellow, with the irresoluteness ex-
pressed in his features of the creature who has
always been subject to rule—grew dubious.
“ Ef it be th’ salt as yez wants, th’ Overseer ’ud
’a issued some ’a yez spoken for it. I might give
yez some now.”
“The Overseer would place you under arrest
for stealing the salt, if you did. No; I would not
ask you to do that, but the salt of the sea-bath
would cure me quickly. On the word of a man
who never lied, sentry, I’ll come back.”
The sentry hesitated. If Mann did not keep
his word, or became too ill to return before the
Overseer and the gangers came back to camp at 6
o’clock, then he would be ruined. Mann read his
thought.
“On my word of honour, sentry, I will be back
before 5 o’clock. It is now about 2. Weak as I
am, I can do the distance in the time.”
“ Strike your breast, an’ swear be God that yez
’ud not ruin me.”
The crude, childish oath was taken. Mann
struggled to his feet, swinging involuntarily round
on his heel from weakness as he did so, and then
invoking what strength he could, set out. Under
some scrubby gums, offending the day with the
rigidity of its contorted nakedness, lay the mur-
dered thing. Feeble as he was and blood-
exhausted, Mann spent a little of his poor force
in breaking off the feathery crest of a young
wattle; and threw it on the corpse. There had
been no opportunity to bury Cummings before the
gang went to labour in the morning, and the
interment would have to be performed by the men
in their own time at night.
The sound of the breaking sapling directed the
sentinel’s notice to Mann. He ran up. “Yez
mustn’t do that, Mann ; Overseer left no orders,”
he said, as he pulled the branch off the dead man.
At no era in its history did the System inculcate
respect for the convict dead. The convict alive
was carrion ; dead, was carrion still.
* # *
Mann dragged himself to the waterside through
the scrub and timber. It was awful work—heroic
in the endurance of suffering: of the acutest kind.
But'lie was whipped onwards by the shadow o*
the cat. Again and again lie fell; and once when
he fell he burst out in a wild spasm of anger, and
swore by the Heaven that smiled upon him and
upon the System that he would not move from the
spot. He grew delirious for a few minutes and
fancied that Franke was chasing him with the
sentries. “Come on! Come on, ye devils!”
he shouted, but they did not come for they were
not there. And then the rustle of the breeze in
the wattles and the gums, while it cooled his
brain for the moment and momentarily banished
the fever of madness, played, too, its tricks with
his fancy. The interlacing shadows caused by the
movement of the branches, seemed to him a
horrid play of doggers’ whips. The air was full
of “cat-tails” —they whistled, they were falling
upon him, they would lacerate him yet again ! In
his dread he rose and turned to flee, and in the
turning dashed his head against the jagged end of
a limb that had been ruptured by a southerly
squall. The wood ripped into his cheek, but the
gashing of the flesh was his salvation. The
inflamed blood was eased through the wound, and
he became rational again.
He cursed his fate that he had become clearer in
head, though his weakness of body had increased
with the out-flow of blood. And he cried against
the God that would not let him die in a blessed un-
consciousness of dying. But again his mood
changed. He remembered his promise to the
sentry and addressed Heaven once more. This
time it was in prayer. He bent his head, and
craved strength to keep his word. “ Let it not be
said that Gentleman Ned had proved false to the
trust placed in him by the miserable wretch of a
soldier-guard ! ” A poor prayer, indeed, and if
wholly sane he would have spurned the paltry
vanity that prompted it. Perhaps, however, all
unknowing to himself the Power Whom he ap-
proached had Himself framed the pleading. The
only evidence the lower-class creature, free or con-
vict, had in those days of the existence of a Power
that was true and righteous and just, was a
brother-man’s word. A broken vow, a violated
promise—and away went the betrayed one’s faith
in God, truth, honour, justice, everything.
Stumbling, staggering, now leaning against a
tree for rest, now pressing his lips against the
exuding gum on eucalyptus boles, he went on to
the rushes, crying aloud sometimes for help and
sometimes hoarsely whispering to himself in pity
of his own plight-moving while two voices echoed
in his ears: “The boat! The sentry !” If he
could only find the boat safe ! If he could only
return to the sentry in time to prevent the man
being punished for the breach of good discipline
caused by his permitting him to leave the camp!
Onward to the boat, back to the tents ! Once—he
gave up and moved in his return path ! And then,
the thought of the boat spurred him forward
again.
* * > #
At last, he reached the bay. Then his
strength came back to him impetuously. He
crashed through the reed-beds out to the circle of
blue water, and plunged into the shallows. The
brine stung him, pricked him—it punctured him
in a thousand pores, but it renewed his vigour,
and supposing there had been human eye to see,
he had been cheered for the boldness with which
he parted the waves as he swam towards the point
in the sedgy arc where the boat had been driven
in by . himself and the other convict. With the
boat was freedom, perhaps happiness, for the
gang ; and though the rush-edges cut his back and
thighs, he was reckless of the smarts in the


■/'///

m
exhilaration of the conquest over himself, his
weakness, Franke, the System—a victory sym-
bolised by that swim through the cool, foam-flecked
billows. He laughed in his sense of triumph as he
recognised where his brother-ganger, in forcing
his way out again from the dense growths, had
broken off short the dagger-points of a cluster of
reeds. He laughed again when the outer line of
sedges closed behind his own path, as treading
water, he drove himself into the springy mass,
and saw the plants which he and his mate had
bent and bruised as they had pushed the boat
before them. It was a note of mighty exultation
that laugh— wuich changed in its last accents to
the dry cackle of a parching mouth.
The boat was gone !
Had freedom, and wealth, and home, and
woman’s love, and the prattle of one’s child, and
all other things that make life glorious, been
offered to Convict Mann the next hour as a con-
dition of his telling, he could not have related
how he reached the camp again. But at five
o’clock, just when the clod's brain of the guard
was dimly pondering the question us to whether
it was not time for Gen’el’inan Ned to be showing
up, he flung himself gaspingly on his rush-bed.
He could have told to an interrogator nothing but
the one thing—that the recollection of the sentry
waiting for the fulfilment of his vow had alone
kept him from there and then throwing away the
life so ridiculed of fate. To march through an
Inferno to reach the boat—and then to find it
gone ! God !
Now, tiie sentry could not know of this dis-
appointment, of course. All that the stupid
fellow saw was that Mann had returned, and,
diverging a yard from his “go,” he strove to make
himself as pleasant as it was right for Authority
to condescend to when the person to be patronised
was only a transport.
“ Yez a-gqt back then, Mann? ’Opes as yez
'ad ’a raal noice swim, now !”
“ Oh, blast you, blast you ! Go away !” the
tortured wretch exclaimed, and turning his head
upon the rushes, reeked nothing of the anger of
the insulted soldier. Which, nevertheless, was
not to be despised, for was he not the representa-
tive of the military power, and the civil power,
and every other power on that hill-side, pending
Overseer Franke’s return.
* * #
At five minutes past six that personage
lame back to camp, closing with his two soldiers
the procession of ironed labourers. He was
affable, and, as the sentry saluted, asked him how
the “gen’el’man ” had passed the day.
“ ’E war inserlent to me, y’r honor—blarsted
me !” reported the soldier.
“ Mann !”
In his tent, the transport heard the command,
and dragged himself to his feet to obey it.
“ Mann!”
Haggard with his shame and with the horrible
recoil from his hope that had acted as a
new blister upon his hurts, Mann went out, and
fainting, faced his tyrant.
“ Ver’ve bin inserlent, Mann ? ”
The transport looked towards the sentry. .And
the sentry then remembered that, after all, it was
Gentleman Ned who had cursed him—and Gentle-
man Ned had kept his word—and once upon a
time Gentleman Ned had doubtless enjoyed the
right to swear at common people like himself—
and so:
“ Mister Franke, I don’t wish to press th’
charge!”
‘ Oh, very well ! Then we’ll let yer orf this
time lightly. An’ so yer’ll jest dig that stiff ’un’s
fer pun’shment! I won’t flog yer agen—
Mann’s first impulse was to refuse-the next to
strike 1 ranke, and he had actually stepped a pace
nearer to the latter when another and wiser
thought occurred to him. He would dig the
grave, for by so doing he would obtain a shovel
which would serve the fell purpose he had in his
mind. The hand he had raised to strike Franke
he carried to his forehead in salute. Franke
noticed the transition and laughed.
‘ 1 hat’s right, Mann ! Yer a-gettin’ broken in
I see! Theres nothin’ like the cat for gentles
arter all—it breaks the spirit so purtily.”
At 6.3 o—the gang had returned from
labour at six o’clock—the evening muster was
held. “Tea”—l2 ounces of maize meal (reduced
by the overseer’s peculation to 10) mixed with
cold water —was rationed out, and then two men
were told off to dig Cummings’ grave.
“ No. 20 ” (Mann).
“No. 7.” This was a feeble old fellow, one of
the “ passengers ” by the fatal “ second fleet ”
‘ built in the eclipse and rigged with curses dark ”
whose constitution had never regained vigour
after the terrible privations of a voyage that had
been one long feast for the sharks which followed
the vessels’ wake.
“ Nos. 20 an’ 7 —no, we don’t give no precedunse
in this ’ere neighb’rood. Nos. 7 and
2011 dig th’ late Mister Cummin’s’ grave—an’
make a tidy job of it—an’ sink four foot!”
Mann and his co-sexton limped towards the
scrub where the dead body lay. The Overseer
followed them, to mark out the grave. He ordered
Mann to take from the heap of tools thrown down
by the labourers a pick, and No. 7, a shovel.
“Ye’re the younger man, No. 14-736’’—when
Franke was unusually genial he would address the
convicts by their register numbers, and not merely
by those of the gang-roll (and when Mr. Franke
was genial the scourger was busy and happy)—
“Ye’re the younger man, an’ jest yer take the
pick, an’ begin ’ere. Oh, it’s the pick—an’ the
cat—as is good fer yer gentles. Oh ” —the jeer
changed dreadfully—“Oh, help! Mutiny”
Ihe crashing of the pick closed the sentence.
Well was it for Overseer Franke that the torture
of the forenoon had drawn the strength from
Mann’s limbs and the oil from his sinews. The
smooth handle of the tool slipped round in the
transport’s hands as he lifted it, and the pick
struck the official’s head with the side instead of
the point. It was well, we say, for Franke ; for
the blow did not kill but only stunned him.
Perhaps, though, it was ill that he survived.
The Overseer’s cry had roused the guard. The
few minutes that they could call their own of the
whole 24 hours were those immediately following
the muster for “ tea,” and before the night-guard
was set. It had been always a thought of Franke’s
that at that time of the day the convict-mind was
less disposed to study the whys and wherefores of
a “ bolt ” than at any other period, because the
gangers would then be suffering from the lassitude
of the day’s severe labour, and the inertia which
comes from stomachs filled—such filling!—after long
fast. Consequently, he had never objected to a
brief relaxation of military discipline. For a few
minutes their muskets would be laid down by the
three sentinels - their pipes would be lit—and they
could feel themselves a trifle freer than the' trans-
ports they guarded.
Now, by this circumstance—this illustration of
his own magnanimity—was Overseer Franke un-
done. Had he permitted no relaxation of sentry-
duty then, his cry would no sooner have reached
the guards’ ears than it would have elicited the
speedy aid of a bullet—and it is quite unlikely
that Convict Mann would have been missed a
second time that day. As it was, though the
three soldiers heard the sharp appeal for aid, they
were some yards away from their muskets, and
before they could reach the weapons several of
the convicts had rushed between them and the
guard-tent. In the passing of the eye-gleam in
which they saw Mann’s deed, some of the
wretches apprehended the consequences of that
act, and, on the instant, became—men. Sottish
they were one moment with the debased cravings
of the creature that exists only to work, and be
fed, and to sleep sleep that gives no rest; but they
were men the next, under the influence of that
blow for mastery. It wooed their manhood back
to them.
And the guard were powerless to help the
Overseer.
* * »
Mann, having struck Franke to the earth,
threw the pick down and strode towards the
startled, but pleased transports. One or two of
the more adventurous of them, in that rebound
towards mental independence, abandoned all
caution, and cheered him. “ Well done, Gen’el’-
man !” “ Well done, Mr. Mann !”
“I don’t think I’ve killed him, coves,” said
Mann, hardened into a vulgar familiarity of speech
by the very deed which had strengthened the
others’respect for him, “he’ll come to, presently.
But, I’ll kill him then.”
A soldier—one of the two that had formed the
gang-guard—at tins, thought to withdraw him-
self quietly from the group. Instantly the action
was noticed, and a ganger stopped him. “No,”
said the fellow, “you don’t get to the town.
We’ve got a chance to bolt now, and we’d be
fools not to use it. What d’ye say, pals ?”
Then, Mann knew his task was easy—even
without the boat. Unless he could tell them of
the boat, he had not thought to win the assent of
every member of the gang to an attempt to
escape. Now, he understood that they had
responded to his rebellious act as tinder to the
spark.
“ Yes,” he exclaimed, “hold the lobsters.”
“ You won’t murder me, Mann ?” entreated the
soldier.
“ No—but we will bind you till we have made
our run.”
“ ’Ear, ’ear,” was gasped by some of the trans-
ports. “We’ll tie ’em up!” And, in a second,
two tents were on the ground, and the lines were
being cut for the pinion-cords for the military
guard, who, once assured of their lives, made but
slight resistance.
The whole camp of transports was now seized
with semi-madness. They were a long way from
being out of the wood, for, as yet, none (not even
Mann himself) had the least idea of how they
were to effect their escape. Inland, or oversea?
None knew. All they cared to understand for the
moment was that their oppressor, who was to
them the only Visible Authority, lay senseless—
destitute of life apparently as he was of power.
In their wild burst of license some rushed on the
store-tent, others sat down to “ oval ” their own
or their comrades’irons. Nearly all whistled or
sang. The soldiers—two tied to tree trunks, tire
third supine on the grass—were amazed at the
antics; Overseer Franke did not remonstrate;
and was it fancy altogether that suggested there
was a grin on Cummings’face?
Mann, as befitted the leadership which lie had
assumed without dispute, was the first to recover
himself. His back was torturing him. The pain
reminded him of his vow. 1 " 1
“ Coves—mates !” he cried. “Silence! we’vn
business to do !”
Instantly they stopped their clamour. Two or
three, however, went on “ ovalling,” and the rinir
of the hammer as they forced the anklet-bazils
out of their true shape so that the feet could be
withdrawn, disturbed, with a singular sharpness
the suddenly-created silence. Disturbed also—
Mr. Overseer Franke. He came to himself.
The gang heard the rustle as he turned on the
gum-leaves where he had fallen ; they heard his
moan and his cry for a drink ; they heard— and
for answer looked at Mann.
And Mann made due reply,
* * *
Ho walked up to the prostrate official and
asked him did he know him—him, Mann. He
put the question courteously—oh, so courteously !
“May I have the pleasure of this valse?”—that
was the style of it. And Franke nodded a “yes ”
and prayed for a drink.
“Cummings craved for a drink—and you gave
him a bullet!” said Mann. 8
Did Franke respond to that retort? Not even
Mann knew, for with that insight with which the
gang, inspired by sudden liberty, had been
endowed, the transports who had handled the
sentries’ muskets seized the weapons once more
and rushed simultaneously to tender to Overseer
Franke the cooling draught he had proffered Con-
vict Cummings.
“Don’t kill him, boys!” said Mann. “Onlv
wound him !” Then— y
“ Stay !” he continued. And motioning for
help he erected the still half-dazed Overseer
against a tree, and called for more cord. They
bound him to the bole, but at Mann’s order left
the wretch’s right hand free.
Free—for a second it was. Then Mann himself
took it (as limp and nerveless as Cummings’ own)
and stretched it outwards by a piece of line, the
other end of which was fastened to another tree.
The cord was tautened, and thus the hand of the
Overseer was between the two trees.
Mann went to the camp fire-place and, lifting a
charred bit of fuel, returned with it and inscribed
a circle, and, within the circle, “a bull’s-eye,” on
the palm of the suspended hand.
“There !” he exclaimed, as he threw away the
charcoal. “ There’s a target. Fire away!”
The second shot riddled the hand, and the third
smashed the wrist.
Then the leader stopped the musketry practice.
“ That is enough for the present, ”he said. “We
may want these bullets for living men. And this
one is as good as dead ! ’
Thereupon Mr. Franke—whose portrait
may be seen in Government House, Sydney-
realised vividly his fate ; and, banishing all weak-
ness-even a tyrant may be strong when pleading
for his life—cried out for mercy, .
“ Yes ! ’ replied Mann, “The mercy you showed
Cummings and myself and all of us !”
“Wot d’yer fight fer Cummin’s fer?” moanedl
the Overseer. “He peached on yer !”
“ Yes?” Mann could not restrain the note of
curiosity in his voice.
“Yes, ’e did. ’E to)’ me ’bout yer findin’ the
boat. An’l gave’im two figs of chaw-stuff fur
a-tellin’ me !”

A FEW TESTIMONIALS SELECTED FROM THOUSANDS:
Nervous Weakness.
F. C. Anstey, Esq., 199 Queen's Gate, London, S.W.,
writes: “ Words fail to express my gratitude to you for
the benefit I have derived from the use of your Electro-
pathic Belt appliances, for now I feel like a new creature
and better than I have done for years. My nerves are
much better, and I have none of that languid feeling
which used to make my life a burden.”
“ Old Jack ” Dickinson.
NERVOUS EXHAUSTION FROM OVERWORK CURED.
“ Horatio House, Leeds, March 20, 1890.
“Dear Sir,—l am glad to inform you that the full power
Eleotropathic Belt 1 procured from you last summer has
made a new man of me, my health being wonderfully
good compared to what it was before wearing this valuable
appliance, and I assure you I would not now he without
it if the cost were ten times more, as it enables me to get
through a vast amount of work in my business without
the least difficulty or feelings of exhaustion and prostra-
tion 1 previously experienced.
“ Wherever 1 go I always speak well of your treatment,
and wishing you every success.—Yours faithfully,
“Old Jack Dickinson (Champion Turf Telegraphist).”
Rheumatic Gout.
“8, Eton Grove, Lee, Kent, S.E., Nov. 27, 1889.
“Dear Sir-Some time since 1 purchased one of your
Electropathic Belts, as I had been suffering for some time
with Rheumatic Gout.
“After a week the improvement in health began, and
continued, and I should be sorry to he without it now.
“Geo. Franklin Chambers.”
Major Pakeniiam, Longslone House, Armagh, writes :
“The Electropathic Belt has completely cured me of
rheumatic gout.”
A Barrister’s Opinion.
F. Arthur Sibly, Esq., Barrister-at-law, M.A., L.L.M.
(Cantab.), writing from Hay wardsfleld, Stonehouse, Glou-
-1 cestershirc, says:-“I must testify to the wonderful
effect of your Electropathic Belt treatment. My vital
energy was so low' that I was quite incapacitated for
work of any kind. I have now regained all the vigour,
i body and of mind, and am completely restored to
health.”
Liver and Kidneys.
Charles Sewell, Esq., Cirencester, writes; “March
24 You may like to hear that I have worn one of your
Electropathic Belts with the most satisfactory results, for
whereas I used to be constantly laid up with liver attacks
and kidney disorders, I have been entirely free from such
ever since I began to wear the Belt.”
A Clergyman’s Opinion.
DELIVERANCE FROM PERPETUAL PAIN,
The Rev, William John Edoe, late Vicar of Holy
Trinity, Upper Tooting, S.W., writes: —“ Having for some
three yens or more suffered from sciatica, which at
length became almost intolerable, 1 was advised to pur-
chase one of Mr. Harness’ full-power Eleotropathic Belts,
on the 10th cf August last, which from that day forward
I have persistently worn without intermission except at
night. After three or four weeks the sciatica left me, and
not only has never returned, but I may say with truth
that, as far as my feelings are concerned, I am not con-
scious of the existence of a sciatic nerve I This deliver-
ance from almost perpetual pain, which at times amounted
to torture, I cannot but ascribe to your Electropathic
Belt, and I feel bound thus to give public expression to
my gratitude.
Sciatica Cured.
From the Widow of a Medical Man who had suffered for
years from acute Sciatica.
“ 14, Upper Bslgrave-road, Durdham Down,
“ CliVon, Bristol, Jan. !), 1890.
“ Dear Sir,—l am quite certain that it will gratify you
very much to know that the Electropathic Belt is doing
me good, and the improvement is most marked in the past
week. The pain is hss severe at night, which I can assure
you is a great comfort, as I have for six months suffered
so dreadfully. 1 look upon you as being a great bene-
factor to the human race, and how clever you are. Please
accept my most grateful thanks, and believe me to remain
yours ever truly,
“Sylvia Purnell.”
Lumbago Cured.
A STATIONMASTER’S LETTER.
Mr. J. B. Carnb, Stationmaster, L.B. and S.C. Railway,
Clapham Junction Station, S.W., writes: “April 7, 1887—
1 beg to thank you very much for the great benefit that 1
have derived from weaving your Electropathic Belt. I
used to suffer with lumbago and pains in the back, both
of which have now ceased. 1 have highly recommended
the treatment to many friends.”
Neuralgic Headache.
“ Woodvi !W, Westbury-on-Trym, Bristol, Jan. 29, 1890.,,
i “Dear Sir,—l have much pleasure in testifying to the
great benefit I have derived from the use of an Electro-
pathic Belt. 1 have suffered intensely from neuralgic
headache, but, since wearing your appliance, purchased
in October, 1889, I have experienced marked relief. You
are welcome to make use of this letter as a true and un-
exaggerated account of what your wonderful appliance
has done tor me.—Yours very sincerely,
“(Miss) A. Evans.”

Mann turned, as though he would have spit
upon the dead body. But his better self was not
yet dead. He thought that, after all, the System
had made Cummings a traitor—and to a meanly-
endowed creature such as he was, two figs of
tobacco in the hand were worth a dozen boats in
the sedge.
“Where is the boat ?” he demanded.
Between the groans and the teats his wounds
were from him, Overseer lianke tried
t° effect a bargain.
“Will yer give me my life if I tells yer, an’ ow
yer can get ort •
The gang waited breathlessly for the reply of
their leader. When it came, after a moment s
deliberation, it was Yes! ~, , ,
“On yer word as a gen el-man?’ bartered the
infamy. ■ , ~ . a ,... .
A lump rose in Mann’s throat. Still—he con-
firmed his previous answer.
, j S .; , ,i j r , * - rj
And the gang breathed freely. And so did
Overseer if ranke. # #
~ , ~ ~ , ~
Then the Overseer told Mann and the
others how he and Cummings and a soldier had
gone to the bay, upon Cummings’ betrayal of the
boat, after dark one night, and had removed the
boat to another part of the inlet. And Cummings
had kept that new secret, because he was to have
a fig weekly till the boat was sold. For, need-
less to say, being a representative Government
official, though the boat was properly Govern-
nient’s, Mr. Franke intended selling it for his own
profit- ... , .. , ~
And how will we get off ?” questioned Mann.
“Ter-day’s Tuesday. Ter-morrer the coaly-town
(Newcastle) schooner’s due, an’ the night arter
she comes in, skipper an crew go shore, ihere
ain’t a soul on board. Thursday night—yer can
go—an’l’ll not report yer till Friday.”
“ ’Ear, ’ear !” applauded the gang. But Mann
remained silent.
“ Yer won’t break yer promise, Mister Mann ?”
pleaded the prisoner.
How the gang enjoyed the “Mister!” But
Mann’s face eloucied the deeper.
“What promise?” he exclaimed, at last.
“Yer promise to give me my life.”
“ I made you no such promise !”
The gang shrank into stupid silence.
“ Oh, yer a gen’el’man—an’ break yer word !”
The misery of that expostulation from the Overseer!
“ Blast you—yes ! You cut the gentleman out
of me with the cat. You die !”
And in the late-fallen dusk there mingled, cun-
ously, the rapturous applause of the transports,
and the alternate prayers and imprecations of the
doomed officer.
* # *
That vvas on the Tuesday evening. On the
Wednesday the gang had a merry day. They
found the boat in the morning, and stored her with
provisions from the store-tent. And in the after-
noon, they pegged-out Overseer Franke. On an
ant-hill, on a wooded gully-rise, they fastened him
down with tent-lines. His right hand was
stretched out with tightened cord again—this
time to a special peg. A track of sugar was made
from the orifice of the ant-bed to the hole in the
band, in case the industrious little creatures
should not otherwise perceive so appetising a
banquet as that shattered fragment of official
humanity. J
Before they pegged him out, they fl gged Over-
seer Franke,
After they pegged him out', they placed some
victuals and water —just outside of his reach. It
was Mann who suggested that last refinement.
In fact, it was the gentleman whom the cat had
robbed of his gentle-hood that devised the means
for keeping the latter-day Tantalus busy while he
lived. And it was not Mann’s fault that he did
not make Franke immortal.
* * *
The soldiers threw in their lot with the
convicts. Such a thing happened as a matter of
course, when there was no superior officer of the
System to say nay.
And on the Thursday they seized the schooner,
and, after a successful trip, reached a South Sea
island.
Sydney heard of them later—when the mis-
sionary, William Ellis, complained to the British
authorities that they were playing havoc with his
mission-field.
But Mann was not with them then. Mann, in
fact, never left Port Jackson. He committed
suicide just as the vessel was stealing out of the
Heads in the midnight-darkness of Thursday
night. His last words were : “ I’ve done all 1
can for you, coves ! Good-bye ! ” And then he
pulled the trigger.
He was privileged to receive an oration over his
grave in the sea.
“Damn him! W’y didn’t he drown hisself !
That shot might be ’erd at South ’Ead Signal
Stashun.”
Absalom West found Franke’s skeleton in 1824.
Jowler’s Grin.
(FOR THE BULLETIN.)
Captain Extie, of Braesend, Clackmannanshire,
was a gentleman of the old school. That is to
say, he wore high collars and a stock, and attended
Board meetings, whatever they may be. But he
had a fault, and that was his dog, Jowler ; and a
worse fault than that was the length of Jowler’s
chain. If I pass within four or five yards of a
savage, chained-up cur I expect to be dangerously
near him, but a man who would let a tiger have
the control of a semicircle of 15 yards’ radius is
faulty. The first time Jowler bit me I was walking
with Lady Extie and her sister, Lady Anna
Quech. They had forgotten Jowler and my bare
legs were tempting. Many dogs will bite a High-
lander who is healthy because his calves are so
handy. I forgive Jowler for bite No. 1. But on
Christmas day in the year following I had
assumed trews, trowsers, pants, inexpressibles—in
fact, the divided garment. 1 was mounted on a
sheltie called Donald. (N. 8.—78 cent, of
shelties are called Donald for short.) The spirit
of a dog was in Jowler, and perhaps he remem-
bered the delicious taste of my calves, but this
time he preferred my thigh. No mistake he
chawed me. Things were reckoned serious. I
was ordered to gallop to Alloa, where Dr. Brother-
stone screwed into each hole a stick of caustic,
giving it that scientific twist which an experienced
bayoneter uses so as to render the wound in-
curable. Then Jowler was chained up in order to
see if he developed hydrophobia. They did not
confine me but looked on mo with sus-
picion. Summer came, when for men there
is no shooting, but the fun begins for
boys who can raise a gun and get a smack at the
rabbits. Now, Jowler would follow anyone with
a gun. This I knew, and showed him my brass-
barrelled, flint-locked blunderbuss, the delight of
my heart and companion of my boyhood. I have
had more fun with that old weapon than with all
the expensive armoury with which, at various
times and in many countries, I have killed, killed,
killed according to the religion of a Christian
(so-reared.) gentleman.
There was a deserted coal-pit on the side of the
hill. Jowler looked in, sniffed at the edge, and—
the kick turned him round. Just as he was dis-
appearing I caught the expression of his counten-
ance. The sweetness of revenge was annulled by
the enthralling smile on the dog’s countenance.
That grin ! Yes, I have made use of that grin,
although just at present it has involved me in a
very serious law case, and now you shall hear how
I am always accompanied by that warning,
bodiless, and soulful entity.
If you have not read “ Alice in Wonderland,”
you are not the man I take you for, O, Theophilus !
Anybody who passes a public library and has the
means of getting promiscuous literature and has
neglected that book is an enemy to himself and
true religion. I don’t know why I rope in true
religion, but it is an almost universal conjunctive-
ness—goes well with almost anything.
Now, Alice saw a grin without a Cheshire cat,
and this is my idea of Jowler’s grin, but Alice saw
the grin solus. My grin won’t come that way ;it
always flat-washes (the only verb I can remember)
the surface of a person, place, or thing.
If in the clouds I see the grin it portends one of
two things, rain or no rain, according as I want
to go out with my worth-a-guinea-a-box girl or to
water my garden. The grin denotes disaster to
your humble. <
If it pervades the countenance of a publican
none of his grog for me.
Before mounting the worst-tempered prad that
ever played Saul (afterwards Paul) on a race-
course and then won for spite, that sinister leer
shot across the brute’s physog., although I could
only see his mouth. His head was shrouded in a
top coat —otherwise no one could mount him.
When Shan MacLoughlan shot me in theCaron-
delet Faro Bank there was the grimace. Certainly
he apologised next day without a trace of it on
his manly mug.
At Howlong, O ! Lord, Howlong, I broke my
leg to the Jowler moue of Moll Miller.
Tails came when I left a small fortune on the
ground instead of socking the winnings. The
was a piece of bark shaped like Jowler’s head with
the grin.
The Lord Ashley was battered to bits on the
way to the Palmer. The tear in the riven spanker
halted just one second with two of its seams like a
dog’s fangs and the opening like a lion’s mouth,
and above a'l the face of the old cur going down
the coal shaft.
Lastly gentlemen ; and far from leastly, in fact,
it’s beastly ; I was engaged to a widow who owned
a terrace of houses. These pay enormous rentals,
being let to the most beautiful women (physically)
in Southjaneshorington. To-day I ought to have
been married. I was introduced to some friends
of my intended bride. They all wore the grin.
This set me thinking. From thought, to specula-
tion, thence to analysis and action. What do I
find ? The widow is only trustee for her daughters,
and can only call her own a miserable annuity of
<£s2 per annum.
So I love, honor and respect the grin. To
Arimanes with the action for Breach of Promise.
They cannot take the breeks off a hie’lander.
In future I use old Jowler’s talisman as a pro-
phetic prophylactic. In cases of doubt and danger
I scan my plane of vision, not hoping or wishing
for, but fearing Ihe dread omen.
Yes, gentlemen, and my dear, it’s not everyom
who owns a guardian ghost of a dead dog’s jaw.
No, sir, I have no hydrophobia, at least, so t<
say.
I hate water : let it be beer again, my pet.

“ A Study in the ‘Nood.”'
A sailor named Grice was seen by the guard of
a goods train lying close to the railway-line near
Warner Town (S.A.) in a nude condition. He
was unconscious and had lain there three days,
during one Of which the glass registered 110 in
the shade; Grice expressed surprise that the train
did hot pick him up.”—Daily paper. In conse-
quence, the muse :
He was bare—we don’t want to be rude—
(His condition was owing to drink)
They say his condition was nood,
Which amounts to the same thing, we think
(We mean his condition, we think,
’Twas a naked condition, or nood.
Which amounts to the same thing, we think);
Uncovered he lay oti the grass
That shrivelled and Shrunk ; and he stayed
XbrSe hot summer days, while the glass
Was one hundred and ten in the shade.
(We nearly remarked that he laid,
But that was bad grammar we thought—
It does sound bucolic, we think
It smacks of the barnyard—of fanning—
Of pullets, in short.)
Unheeded he lay on the dirt;
Beside him a part of his dress,
A tattered and threadbare old shirt
Was raised as a flag of distress;
(On a stick, like a flag of distress—reversed,
We meanthat the tail-end was up hal/masC
On a stick—an evident flag of distress.)
Perhaps in the dreams he persood
Bright dreams of heav'nly bliss ;
And artists who study the nood
Never saw such a study as this.
The “ luggage ” went by and the guard
Looked out and his eyes fell on Grice—
We fancy he looked at him hard,
We think that he looked at him twice;
They say (if the telegrahi’s trim)
When he woke Up he wondered (g'Ood Lord !)
“ Why the enginemian didn’t heaVe to—
Why the train didn’t take him aboard;’ 1
And novy, by the case of poor Grice,
We think that a daily express
Should travel with sunshades and ice.
And a lookout for flags of distress.

WRECKED ON THE GOODWINS.
Erasmus Darwin, grandfather of tlie famous
Charles Darwin, the naturalist, inscribed upon his
seal the significant words, “ Omnia ex conchis”—
all things arise from oysters. But from what do
oysters arise? What is the origin of matter?
Ah! nobody knows. Yet one thing is getting
plainer every day. Let this man’s stUif slioW.
, Hd goes on to say ; “On the Ifth df December,
-8t 2j Whilst Acting AS Slllp’g barren ter on board
the fiteaittsllij) Sorrento , I was wrecked on the
OoodvVin Sands. The shock to my system was so
great as to produce an effect I never felt before.
I fell into a low, weak state, and was seized witli
giddiness and a sinking, fainting feeling. I had a
bad taste in the month, weight at the chest, and
great pain after eating, and my face would burn
like fire. I had difficulty in breathing and palpi-
tation, and often a pain seemed to run from the
heart through to my shoulder. I had a kind of
rumbling all over me, and a choking sehsatiott at
the throat, with a rush of blood to the head.
“'I slept very badly. n.Hd after a time I got so
hervmis And Weak 1 Was afraid to go about, and
Would sit in a chair quite powerless. I saw a
dOetol', who treated me for a time, and then sent
hie to a hospital in Rattlebone Place, London,
where I was under treatment for three months’
but got no better. 3 then put myself under a
local doctor, who said I was suffering from
nervous debility. He patched me up for a little
while, but said to my wife, ‘Your husband is in a
critical condition, and may die at any time.
“ Howeyer, I got to work for a short time, ahd
then was as bad as ever, t lingered On in this
way for years—hoW a little better, now worse, but
never Well.
“ About 1880, whilst working at Messrs. West-
Wood and Bailey’s, Millwall, a mate who saw my
sufferings told me of a medicine called Mother
Ssigel’s Curative Syrup, and he brought me a
bottle. After taking the first bottle I found my
food agreed with me, and I began to improve.
All nervous feeling gradually left me, and by per-
severing with the medicine I was soon cured.
From that time to this I have been a strong man
and done harder work than ever in my life before!
I have since kept Mother Seigel’s Syrup in the
house, and my wife, who was a great sufferer
from rheumatism and dropsy, has found more
relief from it than from anything else. If any of
my family ever ail anything, a few doses soon sets
them right.”
The statement from which the foregoing is an
extract was made by Mr. William Hill, ship’s
carpenter, 108, St. Anne’s Road, London, E.
Now, what is the thing which we said is getting
plainer every day ? Why this : that almost an
infinite number of different results arise from a
single cause. Like the majority of people in all
ranks of life, Mr. Hill had in his digestive organs
the seeds—or what women, when they buy dress
goods, call “ the makings of dyspepsia. Up to
the winter of 1872 it may not have troubled him
much, but the excitement and exposure of the
shipwreck was more than the system could bear.
We mud remember, too, that all shocks to the
mind or body, or to both, act directly on the
stomach. Who can eat when under the influence
pf worry or a great sorrow ? And if this
or sorrow continue! long, it always upsets
the digestion, permanently impairs or destroys
the appetite, and thus brings on an apparently
incurable dyspepsia and nervous debility. Why,
gracious goodness! there arc millions of women!
and lots of men, crawling about under this thing
in England every day in the year. And it is to
theip we are talking. They are half dead, and
we want them to come to life, and get some good
out of their existence. Whatever the ailment is
called, you may h» sure indigestion and dyspepsia
i - at the bottom of it, as in Mr. Hill’s case, and
what cured him will cure you. j
A British gunboat the other day killed a
married fisherman by reckless firing at practice.
rp ie Government awarded the widow 7s. per week,

paupers, is the value Id a woman of her slaughtered

The Melbourne Age revives the story that
m June last, when the unemployed deputation
waited on Premier Munro, out of 10,000 alleged
sufferers only 000 odd registered their names for
the work put in hand by the Government, and
when employment was offered only about 200
avaUed themselves of it. Here is the plain truth,
ihe irades Hall books showed 7000 members of
various trades but, and this balance of unskilled
Unemployed was rightly estimated at 3000. Munro
recklessly promised to find work for all of these
men. Placed in a dilemma, David Syme came to
the rescue. He suggested that the bona .tides of
applications should be tested by referring them to
the inquisitive manipulations of his pet bantling,
the Chanty Organisation Society. Having gained
f m fc h° Secretary, Mr. Jacob Goldstein,
tola ott batches of policemen to personally inspect
the homes of the applicants and make enquiries
relating to their circiimstanceS, When hecessatvj
rom the* neighbours; Rather than submit td
this degradatibh the skillbc} ttadesrhen declined tb'
report or accept work in the form df charity. As
those who had no permanent address, or who had
the slightest flaw reported against their characters,
such as an occasional drunk or summons for
nfr o' i et £b ih the telndtb past; Were uhehied
1 hell gible, fot employ in cut. it Was easy to reduce
the list of applicants by 50 per cent. ‘ Then the
work found was road-clearing and stone-breaking,
at which these inexperienced men could not make
board wages, and as it was doled out not in a lump,
but at periodical intervals, several of the appli-
cants had either perished of starvation or had else
obtained employment elsewlnre, when written to
stating that a job was ready. Now the unemployed
difficulty is again lo the fore, and the Government
in declining to cope with it, triumphantly points
t‘d tile ilt,ter unreliability of unempldyed figured
ibid the diaincliuatiori df the masses to roll up fot
registration.

General Booth has returned to England.
A certain Sydney citizen—an agnostic not giveii
to dreams—after reading “ Ghost Stories,” saw in
a vision, two nights in succession, Booth assas-
sinated by one of his chief officers out of jealousy.
The dreamer, by way of experiment, consulted
tiie reputedly-best clairvoyant in Sydney, who,
when in a state of trance, informed him that his
dream was an omen, and that he should warn
the General. The curious fact is that both
dr carnet ;tnd clairvoyant ate indifferent in their
feelings towards the Army; HoWeVet, the
General can have the story for nothing.
The municipal authorities of Islington

suffering from aphasia, and don’t know what to do

thinks, vaguely, that she has one child, but
whether it is a son or a daughter she doesn’t
