THE MOUTH THE GATEWAY for DISEASE.
Scientists have proved conclusively that no fewer
than 38 different infections may in;' traced to the
human mouth as a starting point. The mouth thus
being the gateway for the entrance of disease, it
is here that precautions are most necessary.
Hudson’s Eumenthol
Jujubes
Are the most powerful, safe and pleasant Germi-
cide and Antiseptic known. Beiny destructive to
all organisms which give rise to infectious diseases,
they keep the mouth in a sweet, healthy condition.
The Lancet (London) states“ Their purpose is to
act as a bactericide in the mouth. This result 'is
i'kely to be gained, for in the experiments tried
Bumenthol Jujubes proved to be as. effective bae-
tericidally as is creosote.”

Max Meldrum
There are no secrets in art, says Max
Meldrum, no tricks of the trade, no char-
latanry. Depictive art is the simplest thing
in the world.
It is not a question of technical method.
If a subject is properly understood, its lines
and tones will be accurately put down; and
by following the suggestion of Nature a
painter will acquire a greater freedom and
variety of brusliwork than by following some
conventional method. The mission of tile
painter is to record on canvas what he actu-
ally sees, not what he thinks he sees or de-
sires to see. Meldrum refuses the title of
“creative artist,” which he leaves to ama-
teurs aud young ladies. His claims are
more modest. He calls himself only an “in-
terpretative” artist, hut an interpreter of
Nature. An artist, he maintains, is the
servant, not the master of Nature. His aim
is not to “create,” which in reality means
to misrepresent according to some individual
capricious or futile fancy, but to render his
impressions in their right order and propor-
tion. The layman, who prefers art to be a
world of illusion, considers truth to Nature
a rather low and limited aim. Should not
all such vulgar realism be left to the photo-
grapher ! But the photograph, though it has
its uses, has limitations. It cannot render
reality, aud compared with the eye must
always be a misleading and unsatisfactory
instrument. Rodin proved that it could not
be trusted, and was infinitely less truthful
than a good artist. A really important
painter must get much closer to reality than
any scientific instrument, though, as Mel-
drum remarks, a good photograph is better
than the wox-k of a mediocre painter.
But it is not so easy as it seems to put
down on a flat canvas impressions of Nature
in their right order and proportion. Before
it good picture the spectator should feel able
to take a deep breath. There must be a
feeling of depth and air, not merely a painted
canvas. That is the first test. Then the
painter must have conveyed to the canvas the
Order and system, as it is in Nature, .of light
and shade, tone, proportion and color. Ren-
dering isolated objects is useless. It is not
enough to give a mass of unrelated details
so that the delighted spectator may exclaim:
“Tla, that is grass! That is a branch!
There is a cow!” In a certain fashionable
portrait the jewels in the ring on a lady’s
finger have been carefully painted, while
the first elementary essentials have been
neglected. Velasquez himself could never
carry his impressions to such minute detail,
for he worked according to Nature’s law of
values.
Meldrum holds a somewhat similar view
in art to that of James Joyce in literature,
that almost any aspect of Nature has so
much interest and significance that it can
exhaust the resources of the very greatest
artists. Subject-matter, therefore, with all
romantic or literary associations, is an
irrelevancy. His own practice is austere.
No painter in Australia so consistently dis-
dains all meretricious aids to popularity.
He distinguishes “pure” from “applied” art,
rlie latter being exemplified in what he calls
“picture-making”—that is, distorting the
Itarmony of Nature and turning it into pretty
little scenes in some “well-known and indi-
vidualist manner.” Any portrait, still-life
or landscape is a subject made to his hand.
No one of any knowledge or authority ques-
tions the power of his portraits or the feli-
city of his still life; but bis Australian land-
scapes have not yet received their proper
recognition. They are as genuine and char-
acteristic of the artist as any other part
of his work. I have heard people ask with
pained surprise: “Why does he make the
grass like a smudge, and why does he cut
off his trees half-way, the trunks of great
sombre gum-trees sometimes cut off before
they reach the first branch?” But Meldrum
paints a gum-tree exactly as he paints a
portrait, and it is equally vital and
authentic.
Long ago my uncle. J. Ford Paterson,
pointed out the peculiar delicacy of the Aus-
tralian landscape, giving as a simple illus-
tration of bis meaning the introduction of
a foreign tree, say, an oak or an elm, which
always; became the most conspicuous, object,
and could be seen for miles, standing out
boldly against the quieter tones of the sur-
rounding vegetation. That showed what , a
delicate landscape it was, quiet, unemphatic,
with a curious magic of its own. I doubt
if any one else saw it quite in that way till
D. H. Lawrence came here and wrote “Kan-
garoo” with its wonderful descriptions of
our landscape which he thought the most
“inconspicuous,” the frailest, but the most
beautiful in the world. Our early painters.
Ruvelot and others, made it too brown; but
Meldrum says that some of the moderns are
just as far astray, and make it too blue.
The prevailing colors, according to his palette,
and representing the Victorian scenes .he
knows, appear to be amethyst, buff and olive-
green. Some of his impressions recall Law-
rence’s descriptions, with their silvery
beauty, golden gleams and vague enchant-
ment. 1
Australia is still an undiscovered country.
That is a work for our poets and artists.
As my uncle once wittily remarked: “Cap-
tain Cook discovered only the outline.”
LIUIS ESSON.
Sport and Art
Sport is much akin to art, and its method
of development is much like that of art.
Primitive man makes a claypot to hold water.
He is driven to do so by Necessity, and Con-
venience gives the shape to which the pot
must conform. His fellow-tribesmen see his
pot, and wonder and praise. But he does not
work in the first place to win their wonder
and praise, and Necessity and Conveni-
ence are sufficient for him. He is the arti-
san. The artist comes afterwards. He sees
in the completed pot not only a thing of
use but a thing of beauty. Tie sees what
ir is in it that has awakened the wonder
ami praise of the tribesmen. So he sets to
the making of pots. But whereas the pot-
maker sought almost altogether for utility,
he seeks almost altogether for that vague
beauty that the first pot expressed. Looking
about him whilst he is moulding his pot
he discovers that he can add a little here
and take away a little there, and by so
doing put something expressive of himself
and his longings into the work. At the
same time he expresses something his fellow-
lribesmen want expressed. By and bye the
pots he produces become wholly things of
expression, and cease to be things of use.
And still they supply a demand. They are
works of art. It is the same with music.
Necessity drives man to make sounds to
designate certain definite wants, and pre-
sently he finds that sounds can be arranged
to designate indefinite wants, vague yearn-
ings and longings for he knows not what.
It is the same with all the arts. They are
all survivals of what primitive man was
driven to by Necessity. It is the same with
sport and the adjuncts of sport—games.
Once man’s life and well-being depended
almost wholly upon his strength, his swift-
ness, his cunning. He was always either
the hunter or the hunted. The chase for
him was everything. He had to kill the
swift buck or be starved, and he had to
kill the all-powerful lion or the all-powerful
lion killed him. And if he were a success-
ful hunter he was acclaimed by the tribe.
But he did. not hunt for acclamation; he was
simply a hunter by trade. The sportsman,
like the artist, came afterwards. He saw
the high place granted by the tribe to the
successful hunter. So he became a
successful hunter. He hunted the swiftest,
cunningest buck when meat was not a neces-
sity, and he hunted the lion when it was
not a menace to him or his tribe. And he
found that he still did what the tribe wanted
greatly done. He was the prototype of all
the sportsmen of the present-day world.
It is the same with games. All nature
was more or less a menace to primitive man.
He had to fight to live. He had to be strong
and swift and cunning. And he trained him-
self instinctively as young animals do to
make himself proficient in the qualities neces-
sary to his existence. The young cat at
play turns its back on the tree and relaxes
itself. Then with amazing swiftness it turns
and leaps and is half-way up the tree. It
does this over and over again. It plays a
game, makes difficulties, as it were, sets itself
problems, and thus prepares for the time
when it might have to turn and leap with
such swiftness to escape an equally swift
and equally well-trained foe. Primitive man
must have been just like that. He had to
bo swift and strong and cunning. He had
to keep 111 his limbs and faculties in perfect
trim. So, just as the cat does, he invented
games and set. himself problems. He ran
and wrestled and threw spears at marks.
And the swiftest, strongest, cunningest man
'.von the approval of the tribe. Now man’s
life does not depend upon his swiftness, his
strength, his cunning. But he still seeks to
possess himself of these qualities. And the
possession of them still wins approval from
his fellow-men. He runs and wrestles and
plays football and cricket and golf. His
games have now set rules and are far more
intricate than those of primitive man. Neces-
sity does not drive him to the playing of
them as it drove primitive man to the play-
ing of his. But his playing at them still
supplies a demand. Who that has ever been
to a Test cricket match or an.international
football match will deny that the successful
athlete is doing something that thousands of
people want done? Like his brother, the
artist, he is expressing something all those
people want expressed.
A game in a great many ways resembles
a work of art. Take a cricket match, for
instance. Convention says how a certain
stroke should be played; but the cricket
genius comes, plays unconventional strokes
and scores rung. He is skilful, confident
of his skill, self-reliant. He does what no-
body has ever done before. Convention says
that an off-ball should be played to the off.
So the bowler places the field to the off and
bowls to the off. He thus limits the scoring
area. But a Trumper comes in and pulls
the ball to the on, and scores runs as they
have not been scored before. He makes the
discovery, defies convention. Then come
others who are not geniuses. They would
never have dared, in the face of the experts,
to do what he has done. But now where he
has succeeded they copy him. They practise
laboriously, and soon the new stroke has be-
come old and conventional. It has entered
the category of common things. It is the
same in football, billiards, golf, in all games.
It is the same in art. The Shakspeare comes
and defies all the conventional laws of the
literature of his time. He shocks the aca-
demics of his time, and gives birth to new
conventional laws. That is the genius’s part
in art. It is also his part in games.
We are all more or less creatures of habit.
We are also more or less creatures of sur-
vivals. Sport and art are both survivals,
and we are all more or less subject to them.
Deep down in each one of us is the sporting
instinct, and deep down in each one of us
is the art instinct. Anything into which com-
petition enters, attracts our attention, and
if we idly scratch the earth with a stick we
find ourselves, quite instinctively, seeking
some design. Primitive man had to be
athletic to live, just as he had to make pots
to hold water. Now man becomes an athlete
to express something within that athletics
can express. And he makes pots to express
something within that they can express too.
All man’s games are survivals of the once
all-important chase, and all man’s works of
art are survivals of the things he made that
were necessary to him. It is said that if you
-scratch a Russian you will find a Tartar.
It really seems that one has not to go very
far beneath the surface of civilised man to
find primitive man. All our ancestors in
all of us to a great extent seem to survive.

Progress!
Two recent developments have focused public
attention on Graham Brothers Trucks as
never before.
One was the recent price reductions.
The other was Graham Brothers ascendancy
to leadership by building more 11-ton trucks
than any other manufacturer in the world
during the first quarter of 1925, and by achiev-
ing second position in the 1-ton and H-ton
fields combined.
Progress such as this deserves public atten-
tion—and eliminates all doubt as to the
logical truck to buy 1

“The Song of Roland”
Crossing the Pyrenees on the way back
from a Spanish expedition, the army ot
Charlemagne was attacked by the Basques,
and its rearguard destroyed. This took place
on August 15, 778, and among the fallen was
the Count of the march of Brittany, Rotho-
landus —that is, in old Frankish, Hruotlant.
No more is known; and yet it is more than
we can ever hope to know; of the heroes and
battles of Greek heroic poetry. What was
“sung and said” of Roland for the next
couple of centuries w r e do not know; the
theories that we so complacently hugged
until 15 years ago by the clock have received
their quietus. Our knowledge resumes with
the battle of Senlac, where the minstrel
Taillefer rode ahead of Duke William
singing clear
Of Charles, of ltollant, Olivier,
And all the knights of each degree
Who fell at Rencesvals,
and, if I remember my “Royal History of
England,” as he sang he tossed his sword
in the air and caught it as it fell —the per-
fect type of a tambour-major. The “Song of
Roland” that we now have is the song of
Charles, and especially of Roland and Oliver,
and necessarily of all the “vassaux” —the
brave feal-men —without whom those heroic
figures are impossible and unintelligible.
Now, thanks to the vast research, the deep
scholarship, the subtle method and fascinat-
ing exposition of Joseph Bedier, we know
that the “Song of Roland,” the earliest of
the Chansons de gestes, is a sudden, spon-
taneous product of the early eleventh cen-
tury; that it is not “Germanic chivalry in
French guise” ; it is French of very France:
the France of Joan of Arc against the Eng-
lish, as this was of Charles and Roland
against the Saracen; that France which
set as proud title in front of its annals
Oesta Dei per Francos. Later research,
which I lack the skill to check, claims to
have discovered its author, the once mythi-
cal Turoldus.
Whatever its ancestry the “Song” implies
and constitutes a fresh start, both in national
spirit and poetic form. It is, first and fore-
most, a poem of Charles, an episode in those
long wars which it is his dire mission to
wage, even though to the marvel of all. men
he has passed his 200th year. And so it is the
first manifesto of the Crusades. It is, next,
the poem of Roland and of Oliver, because,
under God and under their emperor, they are
the champions of the cause of Christ. The
great last battle involves a conflict before-
hand between Roland and Oliver (“for one
is gallant, but the other wise”) ; full drama-
tic contrast, and then the unity at once of
epic poetry and chivalry. In the front of
battle blaze the two great brands, Durendal
and Hauteclair. Finally Roland, slain by
no man’s hand, broken-hearted with the loss
of his comrades, over-toiled in fight, bids
farewell to his bright and holy sword, after
all his vain attempts to shatter it.
The art of the “Song” is a tiling as un-
accountably new as its spirit. The verse is
an accented decasyllabic; its groupings go by
assonance iii complexes of irregular length,
called laisses. Each verse within each laisse
is a complete and perfect unit; the sense is
stopped at the end of each—a more deaden-
ing rule, we might say, than that of the
stopped couplet. But the poet has a counter-
balance in the laisse. Within that the single
verse may mark itself off as a unit; he
plays the laisses against one another, to a
marvellous effect of heightening either along
the epic line of repetition or the dramatic
line of contrast. And the single verses, each
fulfilling its due function within its proper
limits, under control of that greater form,
fall like the flashing strokes of the great
swords in the dolorous pass.
And there again this poet—for he was one
and individual, whether his name be Turol-
dus or not —has, even as in his ordonnance
of the whole poem, framed this, God’s lost
battle, in the dire straits of the hills, the
narrow defiles under the dark peaks. There,
in the ultimate strait, the Christian chivalry
succumbs, overworn but unconquered, to
wave after wave of Paynim onslaught. The
minor imitative poetry of it we may read in
Byron’s “Siege of Corinth” : the actual threat
of it was impending over us in March, 1918.
And Charles? We come back to him, the
over-labored. Roland is dead and happy, his
soul is with God; but the old king cannot
foresee the ending of his toils. One thinks
of the noble Odysseus of the “Iliad” —“give
no orders to us,” he says to Agamemnon, “on
whom God hath laid this sore burden that
from youth even to old age we wind up the
grievous ravel of war until we perish every
one.” It is the same spirit; only here God
is manifest through his messenger—
Charles falls asleep like one that has hard toiled.
To him God sends the angel Gabriel,
He charges him to watch the emperor.
The angel stands all flight beside his head.
Through vision then he does announce to him
A battle coming even now his way.
Interpreted, it signifies much grief.
Charles look’d aloft, towards the heavens above,
And saw the thunders, saw the winds and frosts
And all the storms and tempests marvailous.
And Are and flame were shown unto him there.
And straightway both rain down upon his folk;
The spear-shafts burn of ash and apple-wood,
And every shield even to its golden boss—
and Charles, God’s elect, cannot, any more
than Job. escape the visions of Jehovah and
drink deep of the nightly draught vouchsafed
to mere mortals.
The poem is of the kind to make one drunk
—“so vast a battle storms about your brain”
—and . one must be on the guard against
enthusiasm. Nevertheless, one may say
that, where the Germans must needs shelter
their “Nibelungenlied” under the wing of
Homer, the French can set their “Song of
Roland” where it deserves to stand, by itself.
Its fate was curious. From it certainly
Dante got his knight of God, Orlando, whom
he, first and only, leads into the oecumenical
poetry of Europe and the world, to the blast
of that tremendous horn which Roland would
not wind before the last extremity:—
Dopo la dolorosa rotta, quando
Carlo Magno perdo la santa gesta
Non sono si terribilmente Orlando—
and, after him, though the figure of Orlando
is wonderfully developed by the Paduan poet
of the Entree d'Espagne and many a fol-
lower, though Boiardo. for his charming but
perverse purposes, had set that horn sound-
“R dreadfully at dawn from the heights of
Albracca. there was a loss to the world’s
imagination until, as a prelude to the re-
discovery of the long-forgotten texts —the
“Song” was found at Oxford in 1837—Roland
came back again to the same music:—
Oh, for a blast of that dread horn
On Fontarabbian echoes borne,
That to King Charles did tell
How Roland brave and Olivier
And many a paladin and peer
By Roncesvalles fell.

On Burials
Has an individual of non-orthodox opinions
any right to a say regarding the manner in
which his funeral obsequies shall be con-
ducted? Have his surviving relatives (his
wife in particular) any justification in
setting aside his expressed wishes (some-
times in testamentary form) with regard
to the fashion wherewith his mortal shell
shall be consigned to the tomb or the crema-
torium? I am driven to make these in-
quiries from having observed what has hap-
pened in the case of certain men of world-
wide fame and of rationalistic opinions who
have died lately and whose funeral cere-
monies contained features that were an
insult to the eminent man over whose re-
mains they were celebrated.
There is, notoriously, a disposition on the
part of pious women with husbands of
agnostic opinions to give the world to under-
stand that the deceased —should the husbands
die first —experienced a “change of heart”
before their departure. One of the most
notorious cases is that of Lady Burton, who
spread the story that her husband, a pro-
nounced rationalist, received voluntarily the
ministrations of a clergyman some time be-
fore his death. It has since been proved that
the legend was entirely without foundation.
But the instances I desire to quote are of
much more recent date and concern men
much more widely known even than Burton.
Take the case of John Morley, biographer of
Gladstone, a charming essayist, a renowned
philosopher, a Minister of the Crown for
many years, and a man who, though not
averse to compromise when compromise could
be effected without a too great sacrifice of
principle, steadfastly refused all his life to
bow his head in the temple of Anglican
orthodoxy or Nonconformity. When Lord
Morley died his will was found to contain
the expression of a wish that no ceremony of
any kind should take place at his burial. Yet
an Anglican funeral service, at the instance
of his wife, was read or “celebrated” over
his remains, and the voice of proper indigna-
tion at this violation of Morley’s wishes was
stifled out of respect to the Peeksniffian
might of British orthodoxy. The case of
William Archer, who died last December,
is another that has attracted some attention.
Archer was the first dramatic critic of his
day. He was, moreover, a fine Scandinavian
scholar, an author of numerous works on
dramatic subjects, an essayist of the first
rank, and a man who scorned to conceal his
agnostic opinions. Yet concerning his
obsequies one reads :
At the funeral at the pretty little church at
King’s Langley on December 30 there took place the
regulation service, he having bought a‘ burying-place
there and left no directions for the disposal of his
body. The clergyman, after the customary ritual,
paid a cordial and satisfying tribute to the dead
man’s excellence of heart and head, as a man and
as a mind. His old friends could not havg asked
for more.
But Archer might have asked for more;
and his old friends might have done so, too.
Surely they might have asked that Archer’s
remains should not have been interred with
a ceremony which, in view of his opinions,
was nothing but a mockery. It is quite in-
conceivable .that a * man who tvas in the
first rank as an outspoken rationalist should
have wished a religious ceremony of any
kind to take place at his grave. Yet Archer
was a man of the widest charity. With re-
gard to those from whom he differed on theo-
logical matters he took as motto the noble
phrase: “We will not attack you; we shall
explain you.” Surely this last slight might
have been spared to so noble a memory.
They manage things better in France.
When Anatole France was buried there was
no religious ceremony whatever at his grave.
Nobody implored the Deity in whom this
illustrious writer disbelieved to have mercy
upon him, and it is certainly not uncompli-
mentary to the same Providence to assume
that Anatole’s chances of mercy—if need for
mercy should ever be—will be by no means
impaired by the omission. A Times corres-
pondent remarks: “It was curious to note
how greatly the absence of any religious
character detracted from the impressiveness
of the proceedings.” Surely the want of the
“impressiveness” given by a ceremony which
would have been to Anatole France in the
nature of a farce was no loss at all. The
great Frenchman had looked in the future
as far as mortal eye could reach and had
seen
Solemn before us
Veiled the dark portal,
Goal of all mortal;
and was contented to leave it so. His friends
respected his opinions and his memory.
If a man of strongly Protestant opinions
were interred with a Roman Catholic cere-
mony, or if a Roman Catholic of pronounced
views were buried by a Church of England
clergyman with the customary Anglican
burial service, what an uproar would be
raised on the matter by one section or the
other! Naturally the thing seldom, if ever,
occurs. Should not the same respect be
extended to the convictions and character of
a departed rationalist by friends and rela-
tives of orthodox opinions? After all, as
the great Goethe said. “Toleration is the
only real test of civilisation.”
P. AIREY.
Guitry, Father and Son
The recent death of Lucien Guitry in his
early sixties has made a strange gap in
the stage, not only of France, but of the
world. Although it may be urged that his
career will be continued in that of his brilli-
ant son, Sacha, it must also be admitted
that Sacha’s work, both as actor and as
playwright, has been at its strongest when it
was related to his father’s.
For more than 20 years the French play-
wrights have depended on Lucien Guitry and
have written plays for him. Consider that
terrible play by Henri Bernstein, produced
in 1906. “The Claw.” Its leading character
was a wealthy, middle-aged man, on the
left wing in politics, infatuated with a young
girl who was less naive than she seemed. He
marries her. and during the subsequent acts
the man’s honor slips from him and his men-
tal powers decay, all in the effort to satiate
his wretched wife’s greedy ambitions. In
the last act he is indicted as a political
traitor and accused of definite corruption.
He intends to carry it off by a swaggering,
emotional speech in the Chamber, but finds
that his strength is going and his memory
with it. His wife is disgusted with his col-
lapse. Refusing to help him in his coming
disgrace, she goes off with a young lover.
The old man, whose house is now attacked
by an angry mob, becomes light-headed. As
stones are thrown, he remembers his early
days and cries, “The people are being mas-
sacred! To the barricades!” He chants a
song of the Paris Commune; then, dancing
on a table, he sings the fateful song of the
French Revolution :
Dansons la Carmagnole,
Vive le son... .du canon !
The last curtain falls on this mad scene.
Guitry’s character-acting in this play has
been preserved in a series of pencil draw-
ings. His face showed the decadence of the
politician during the four acts, which are
rather widely spaced in time. Guitry re-
vealed his character as passing not merely
from middle age to premature senility, but
from honesty to corruption, from stalwart
uprightness to hesitating, tremulous weak-
ness. There you had a well-defined charac-
te", consecutive renderings of a personality,
and at the same time an overwhelming change
from act to act. Such fabulous versatility
was Lucien Guitry’s forte.
Sacha Guitry evidently recognised this,
and in “A Subject for a Novel” he gave his
father a heavy task. This play, produced
only two years ago at the Theatre Edouard
VII., took for its object “to l'eveal to the
audience the joys and sorrows of those who
devote their lives to it.” It represented an
elderly novelist, adored by all his readers
except his wife and a few mercenary-minded
friends. As he grows older, the novelist
writes more slowly: he is fatigued, he' is
more fastidious, he will give his best. His
wife attacks him for an idler, and he has a
nerve-storm, a collapse. During the second
act he appears with his brain wholly clouded,
while his wife schemes for a hack-writer to
dish up some notes her husband had put to-
gether and make them into a highly remuner-
ative novel. In the third act he has recovered
suddenly, and in the end finds that his wife
while burrowing among his papers has come
upon bundles of letters from his devout
admirers. She can do nothing, when she is
alone, but read them oyer to herself, marvel-
ling to find what man she has lived with for
so long. He finds her in the small hours
reading them aloud: “Those who have the
honor to know you and approach you!” She
looks up, and, imagining that his mind is
still far away, says to him over and over,
in little, easy words: “My husband, I am
sorry. Will you forgive me? I am sorry.
Do you understand?” To her amazement he
answers in reasoned, ironic words. It is a
long speech, such as only an accomplished
actor can handle. He says that on the whole
he will forgive her: “I have no wishes of my
own. My character, my opinions, and my
ideas. t-hese I have sprinkled among the
people in my books. .. . But if I were one of
my characters now, what would I make him
do? For the sake of the denouement, for the
sake of drawing a sort of moral, he would
have to forgive her. Yes, it finishes best
like that.” So he is the subject of a novel,
one of his own.
The old actor took this character in his
stride. “His tumbled white hair, his droop-
ing moustache d la Flaubert, his _ tortoise-
shell glasses, so often bent oyer his books,
his fine forehead bathed in the light of genius,
the mask of his face carved at once in sad-
ness and serenity”—seeing him so, the theme
of the play was clear.
They say indeed that whenever Sacha
Guitry as dramatist deserted light comedy
and wrote a serious and solid play, it was
with his father in mind. So he wrote tin;
play “Pasteur,” with his father in the his-
toric name-part. But Lucien Guitry did not
depend on his son to provide him with roles.
As late as last winter Guitry was acting in
Moliere at the Theatre Edouard VII. It
must have been amusing, if only because
Antoine, the great manager, used to come
forward as prologue and make a witty speech
to the effect that the people at the Comedie
Frangaise (the State Theatre) had no idea
how to act Molihre: “So, if you want to see
how Moli&re should be acted, please keep
your seats.” The curtain would then rise to
let Guitry proceed with the good work. The
Comddie Frangaise was not flattered; but
it is one of those institutions that become set
and complacent for want of an occasional
goad.
Now Lucien Guitry is dead, and those
who saw him in London and Paris will be
telling one another all they can remember
about him. Sacha Guitry, who is actor as
well as dramatist, will probably never be a
great power like his father, but he has his
own qualities. In French life to-day Sacha
is “a dancing shape, an image gay.” His
comments are light, but to the point: he has
a little column to himself every week in Lf,
.Journal Amusant. The same paper thinks
him fair game. In writing satirical New
Year wishes to various well-known people, its
editor wished for Sacha Guitry “a little
publicity, in case he isn’t in the position to
make himself the usual amount.”
It had better be admitted, then, that Sacha
Guitrv is a brilliant young man who puts
plenty of goods in his window and likes
people to stare at them. But he sometimes
can creep away to the shop’s little back par-
lor. Seated there, he thinks and writes;
writes too much, perhaps, too fast, but bril-
liantly and safely. Again he comes forward
as an exquisite and polished actoi\ He is
still young, and the world will not soon be
sated with such vivacity.

“They make a great difference
and keep the car very steady.”
—just what they
were made for — to
keep the car steady!
A motorist at Cobar, in the west of New South Wales, fitted a set of
new Stewart Shock Absorbers to his Rugby and found such a marked
difference in the riding that he was moved to write as above. The
comfort this man is getting from the Stewart Shock Absorbers can
be yours also, whether you have a Rugby, a Ford, a Buick, a
Studebaker, a Dodge or one of the numerous other makes of cars
on the market.
It Does Act Well.
There’s no doubt about it! The Stewart is wonderfully effective in
snubbing the inevitable rebound of the car body following the striking
of a rut or pothole. And what is more, it actually can and does
snub every rebound—no matter how fast the rebounds come. It’s all
a matter of design and construction—and the Stewart is proving
itself day in and day out on our all-too-plentiful bad roads
The Stewart is capable of absorbing every shock the wheel receives
because its strap does not coil upon itself as in the earlier type of
absorbers. This coiling of the strap upon itself results at times in its
sticking, and the action of the absorber is thereby necessarily retarded.
The friction required to absorb the shocks is, in the Stewart, supplied
by two specially-treated friction discs, which act like friction clutches
on the sides of the steel drum containing the recoil spring. The strap
simply rolls with the drum for a portion of a turn, consequently it is
not subjected to excessive wear and stretching, with the frequent
breakages these entail. A set of Stewart Shock Absorbers will give
you riding comfort, and will protect the car springs.

“Why, she looks as young and charming as her daughter.” How
often have you heard these words spoken about women who have retained
their girlish appearance while their family is quickly growing up around
them! Have you ever stopped to think what the real secret of their
youth is? The turning-point of youth to early middle-age comes when a
little silvery grey creeps in amongst that crowning glory of women—their
hair. No matter the youthful bloom upon the check, or the figure its easy
girlish form, the hair appearance is the mirror of the age.
Stou for a moment and think of the really smart women that you
know; they do not allow those tell-tale grey hairs,' the unmistakable symbol
of advancing years, to creep in and spoil their beauty.
Grey hair can never be fashionable—it is the first sign of old age. A
man may be as old as he feels —but a woman is as old as her hair.
Dr. Allen’s Mexican Walnut Stain has enjoyed the confidence of women
for 25 years—it is perfectly harmless, easy to apply, immediate in action,
and, above all, undetectable. Carefully carry out the instructions and let
it restore your hair to its natural shade. Grey hairs will vanish like magic
and youth will walk in at your door.

The South-West Arm: Port Hacking.
Vital and bright the new-born day,
Lavish of lustrous gold,
Spreads its splendor o’er beach and bay,
Highland and headland old.
Steals a wind from the outer sea,
Softly o’er gum and palm,
Breathing of spaces wide and free,
Sleeping in azure calm.
All dew-wet are the saplings trim,
Leaves in the light ablush,
While aloft on a she-oak limb
Warbles a joyful thrush.
Strong and sweet in his leafy place,
Lone and hidden from sight,
Sings that thrush for a moment’s space,
Voicing his sheer delight.
Then, as though at his will set free,
Over the water floats,
Making a feast of melody,
Music from many throats.
Singing, singing as one, are heard
Lyrists on limbs above—
Honey-eater and butcher-bird,
Warbler and cooing dove.
All together, and all as one,
Fine of feather and voice,
Greeting the golden godlike sun,
“Rejoice!” they carol. "Rejoice!”
Breaking the water a porpoise shoal
Leap in the new-born day,
Lustrous waves from their sides a-roll
Circling the shining bay.
Over the flats the tide comes in,
Setting the Aveeds adrift, .
Welcomed by flashing tail and fin—-
Mullet and kingfisli swift.
Flushing the flats with waters sweet,
Flooding rock-pools and grooves,
Hither and thither with velvet feet
Coasting the shore it moves.
Yon a bream through the shallow shoots,
Yonder a gannet wheels,
While, aAvash in the mangrove roots,
Over the sand it steals.
Golden lights from the sky downpour,
Falling on hills of green;
Beauty hovers o’er cove and shore —
Beauty of song and scene.

Shadows.
When the goblin rain is crying
Through a sodden dusk of fear,
When the lonely day is dying
In a grey light thin and drear,
There’s a dream I dream, a sorrow,
Like a ghost of ancient grief,
Of a night that has no morrow,
And a blind wood bare of leaf.
When the house is hushed and breathless,
And the wind sobs at the door
Like a vampire, dead, yet deathless,
That must hunger evermore,
Then the old ghost-griefs come creeping,
And anew my heart must break;
For though sorrow’s self be sleeping
Yet the wraiths of sorrow wake.
When the star-bells toll night restward
From the morning’s silver spire,
And the moon-lamp glimmers westward,
Hung in skies of fairy fire,
There’s a singing dream, a splendor
In my heart that’s healed anew,
As the sun-drenched mists surrender
And the world flames out anew.
lake a shadow sorrow passes ;
And I gaze with gladdened eyes
On the green flame of the grasses
And the blue flame of the skies.
To the golden morning’s greeting
Will I tune my song of praise;
For. though Beauty’s self be fleeting,
Yet the joy of Beauty stays !

Armaments come of errandising doom,

THE MYTHICAL MANUFACTURING
MILLIONAIRE.
The new Premier of N. S. Wales speeds on
his breathless way, making alarming dis-
coveries, finding billets for supporters, issu-
ing almost every day a nagging scream about
his own good qualities and the inferior ones
of his opponents, and dropping on unexpected
deposits of millionaires who don’t contribute
as they should to the support of his sup-
porters. In the natural course of events, he
got on the trail of the Australian manufac-
turer. A characteristic of Labor-leaders is a
fierce animosity towards the Australian who
produces goods for Australian use out of
Australian materials, pays full award wages
to expert Australian workmen for short Aus-
tralian hours, and does more than any one
else to prevent Australian city-folk being
all roadmenders, dealers, parcel-carriers or
deliverers of milk. This attitude is in strik-
ing contrast to their unfailing tolerance of
the importer, a middleman who deals in
foreign materials, mostly brought here in
foreign ships, gives indirect employment to
many outside workmen, and supplies direct
employment chiefly to some local clerks,
packers and commercial travellers —a service
which the manufacturer performs also. Pos-
sibly the explanation is that the manufac-
turer, being cumbered with heavy machinery,
pan’t, so easily as the importer, dodge spolia-
tion and insult by shifting his headquarters
over a border-line. Probably it comes of
reading old tales about the sweated toilers
of a century ago in England, just as the
revolutionary movement is built on the doings
of dukes and the like in Russia. Anyhow
it was quite in the order of things that Lang
should break out as follows:
I recognise that it would be madness to kill the
goose that lays the golden eggs—to place such re-
strictions or burdens on industry that it could not
be profitably continued—but when we consider the
Enormous Surplus Profits (that is Unreasonable or
Excessive Profits) at present extracted from every
stage of our industrial processes, it must be confessed
we are a long way off doing any real injury to in-
dustry by fair increase in wages, improvements in
working conditions, and the adoption of the 44-hour
working week.
* * * *
The Lang Ministry is headed by a subur-
ban estate-agent, and the rest of it is mostly
lawyer, ex-civil servant, trade-union secre-
tary and a trace of Labor newspaperism.
There isn’t known to be one man in the com-
bination who pursues big industry or even
medium-sized industry, who pays wages to
the horny-handed artisan, or who knows, save
by heated hearsay and gassy inference, that
there are Enormous Surplus Profits in every,
or any, branch of industry at present. The
ex-master tailor of the last Labor Cabinet,
who once employed nine subordinate tailors,
isn’t in this Cabinet. The immensely
wealthy chemist and property-owner who
sparkled in the same previous Ministry isn’t
in this Parliament at all. The big boot-
manufacturing member of the party doesn’t
fit into any Labor Administration, probably
because he has an inside knowledge of what
profits really are, and can’t join whole-
heartedly in the crazed but breezy chorus.
It is a very casual crowd which thinks it
knows all about the mythical manufacturing
millionaire, of the Ma State. Some details
about that person are worth a mention: —
In 1923 there were 6702 factories in N.S.W.
according to the official list (full details for 1924
are still wanting). Of these 1439 employed less than
four hands; 2083 employed four or less; and the
number which didn’t exceed 20 employees was 5251.
The working boss was included among the four or
more hands. The bulk of the manufacturing industry
of the State isn’t conducted on a scale to allow of
Enormous Surplus Profits, such as may be conceived
of in an estate-agent’s imagination.
At latest figures the number of factories and the
number of employees in the vast area outside the
metropolitan area were both declining. If the Enor-
mous Surplus Profits had been satisfactory in that
region the decline would hardly have happened.
When the two sets of figures were last made up
the visible wealth of the N.S.W. community, apart
from book debts and such-like paper assets, was set
down at £948,000,000. The manufacturer was
credited with owning or owing for £59,500,000 of
fixed assets (land, buildings, plant and machinery)
out of this total, or he would have done so if his
premises were always his own, which is far from
being the Case. Manufacturers supply more employ-
ment than any other class, but they certainly don’t
show up as owning any absurdly large proportion of
the community’s fixed assets.
By last figures the aggregate N.S.W. manufacturer
was supposed to have, out of the “value added in
process of manufacture,” about £20,760,000 left
after paying the year’s wages and fuel bill. This
sum was available for Federal, State and municipal
taxes, water supply, rent, interest, discounts, travel-
ling expenses, office expenses, repair and replacement
of plant and buildings, additions to same (the amount
invested in additions for the year was apparently
about £7,000,000), bad debts, depreciation of stock,
and sundries. What remained after these were pro-
vided for was profit for the 7321 owners, many of
whom were not individuals, but companies repre-
senting, perhaps, hundreds of owners. The exact
surplus it would take some trouble to find out even
approximately, but even if trouble is involved a roar-
ing but inexperienced Premier should investigate a
little before he talks wholesale and retail plunder.
* * * *
Really large industrial concerns in this
country are mostly owned by companies. The
great individual capitalist more often goes in
for squatting, or importing, or the Emanuel
Myerson or Gregory McGirk trade of plain
landlordism. It is easier and pays better
than doing battle with strike leaders, arbi-
tration courts and abusive politicians, mostly
men of unproductive occupations, in the cause
of Australian industry. And the biggest share
list can be searched very long and earnestly
without it revealing the stupendous profits
about which the ignorant orate and the thick-
witted discourse through their hats. But such
items as these are common enough:—

There are no really big industrial profit-
makers on the list to offset that melancholy
procession. Still, all these industries are
working, which is something, even though
some of them may see suspension in sight.
Very many concerns, large and small, have
left off, like the Newnes oil enterprise, in
which some enterprising men invested over
£700,000, instead of sticking to the safer
lines of politics and land-dealing. But it
shouldn’t be necessary to refer the Langs
and their noisy kin to a share list for evi-
dence. N.S.W. Labor is itself a manufacturer
in a pretty large joint-stock sort of way. It
manufactures a Sydney morning paper, and
if that venture extorts Unreasonable or Ex-
cessive Profits the fact isn’t generally sus-
pected. Labor, in its Parliamentary capacity,
has been a manufacturer of and dealer in
many things, including bricks, loaves, drain
pipes, electricity, ships and canned fruits.
The aggregate result, despite exemption from
many of the burdens which the private em-
ployer has to carry, has been immense loss.
If the cause of the loss was incapacity and
dishonesty then the party shouldn’t be in
office so often. If it is simply that there are
not, under existing conditions, any wonder-
ful profits in manufacturing industry, then
the Langs of the party shouldn’t cut such
capers before high Heaven when they are
in office. Incidentally, the share list includes
the name of one large Sydney company in
Premier Lang’s own non-productive line of
business —land-dealing. It has a paid capi-
tal of £471,000. On £200,000 of this the
average dividend for the last three years has
been £7 6s. Bd. per cent, and on the other
£271,000 it has been 8 per cent. A smaller
Sydney company, also in Lang’s business,
has averaged for the same period £l9 6s. Bd.
per cent. This may possibly be taken to
signify that the Premier’s trade calls for
more comment than that of the manufacturer.
Recent records alleged that there were 4178
manufacturers in the metropolitan district
and 969 estate-agents, so there is material
for inquiry both ways.
TROUBLE ON THE PLANTATION.
Asia may be said to-day to be flaming with
revolt. In some parts of the vast plantation
Europe has made of the non-white world
the revolt takes the form of bomb-throwing
and active propaganda ; in others actual war
is being waged. Australia, one of the few
outposts of the British Empire that isn’t
manned with colored helots, stands on the
edge of the complicated tumult. No gesture
she can make is likely to affect the issue,
and yet her own destiny may be fundamen-
tally influenced by its outcome. The capital
made by Australian Labor politicians out of
the accidental circumstance that an Aus-
tralian warship happens to be exercising in
the vicinity of one disturbance is an example
of how a foreign question may be used to
gain an advantage in a domestic squabble;
hence the threads making up the twisted
skein are worth examining in case something
coherent can be made out of a curious tangle.
* # * *
Modern industrialism has been advanced
as one of the reasons why the meeting of
East and West has resulted in a series of
explosions. There is no doubt that mass
production by machinery in European-owned
factories on Asiatic seaboards has caused
immense suffering and unemployment inland.
The little village industries were first de-
stroyed by the competition between machine-
made piece-goods and the productions of the
liand-loom; and the jobless class that was
thus created supplied the labor for further
cheap production. Nevertheless, the Asiatic
had fairly large-scale industries of his own
before the white man came ; he had built up an
impressive commerce all round the Asiatic
shores, and in the guilds he had, ready-made,
a trades-union organisation well able to pro-
tect its members from exploitation under
conditions that were not too abnormal. An-
other fact, often ignored by agitators
anxious to make a case against the Western
capitalist, is that Asia has started breeding
capitalists and captains of modern industry
of her own skin-color, and this process would
not stop if all the foreign capitalists were
assassinated to-morrow. Even the dislike of
alien government does not. explain the rancor
in the Asiatic _ breast; the personality of
his rulers, provided they leave him more or
less alone, never troubles the Oriental citi-
zen. He has remained warm* and comfort-
able under alien usurpers through most of his
history. The Oriental politician has no re-
semblance to an Australian suburban coun-
cillor. Gandhi, who starts a fast in bitter-
ness of soul because his followers have been
guilty of murderous precipitancy, is a type
of the Asiatic statesman. The figments of
the mind are the only realities in the world
of shifting shadows that moves east of Suez.
Like that race of people who were alleged
by Greek geographers to live on odors, and
who died when they came within smelling
distance of the crude aroma of a piece of
steak, the person . in the loincloth stands
solid against the impact of material forces,
but bends and breaks under the bombardment
of a new idea.
* * * *
Bolshevism and the Christian ethic are
the two ideas which have most strongly
affected Asia’s mentality of late. The claim
that Christianity is an Eastern religion
ignores the fact that Asiatic society based
on the. family has always instinctively re-
jected it, whereas it was promptly taken to
Europe’s individualistic bosom. The heretic
Nestokius led the first big offensive east-
wards. So successful was it that by the
eighth century Nestorian bishoprics were
flourishing from Samarcand to Peking. By
the time the Portuguese adventurers re-
discovered China it had vanished from the
scene, leaving only an inscribed stone in
Si-nganfu. The second great offensive,
backed by all the might of Rome, nearly
resulted in the adoption by a Chinese
emperor of the foreign faith; but this
attempt collapsed in the ultimate test against
the same barrier as all the others. Asked
by the Jesuit advisers of the Peking court
whether ancestor-worship and the family sys-
tem were compatible with the Christian
creed, the Pope was compelled regretfully to
say no, and the influence of Rome faded like
a dream. The final attack upon the Asiatic
mind came in the middle of the nineteenth cen-
tury. The missionaries, driven by revolt out of
farther Asia, returned with the bayonets and
battleships of the Western Powers behind
them. Every show of opposition that took
the form of violence only brought them back,
when the dust of bursting shells had settled,
with fresh treaties in their hands and greater
privileges to build and preach. Against this
new assault Asia had no defence. She had
to stand by and watch depots for the manu-
facture of spiritual dynamite being erected
everywhere in her midst. Like Communism
in a capitalist country, the alien religion
attacked the very basis of Asiatic society.
Before the missionary came the father could
punish his rebellious child with death, and
the lazy one with expulsion from the family.
The missionary taught that it was right for
a son to leave his father and follow a higher
master. Pie taught that the individual had
a soul to save and that his chief aim in life
was to save it: the Oriental teaching is that
the individual’s sole religious function is
to provide in this world the means whereby
his father and the myriads of his forefathers
shall be kept in ease and plenty in the next.
Any member of an Asiatic family who finds
the pressure of this system irksome can
always secure a refuge in the Christian
church; so the missionary is feared and
hated by every Eastern patriot for precisely
the same reason as the early Christian social-
ists were feared and hated by every Roman
patrician.
* * * *
Bolshevism completes in the native village
the disintegrating process that Christianity
began. It is the doctrine that a mob can be
master of its fate, that the lowest and most
uninstructed of the populace are under th
sacred necessity of rising up and seizin? th
reins of government from their rulers ti •
is exactly the opposite of the Oriental creed
which insists that the father is the "narZ
of his family, the headman is the father of
the village, the magistrate is the father of hi
province, and the ruler who derives h«
power from Heaven is the parent of the lot
and that the right to wield authority i s
on the possession of a “superior” or educated
mind. Such are the main causes of discon
tent down m the plantation. And when the
dissatisfied workers rise at the instigation of
Bolshevik agitators and chase the European
masses off the premises; or when, with th»
aid of Japanese militants, they indulge in
civil wars for the establishment of democratic
Governments; or when a Chinese Christian
general declares, in the name of the Christian
God, a holy war on European Christians
they are not showing a preference for one set
of masters as against another, but a desire
to be left to mismanage the plantation in

PROFESSIONAL CONFIDENCE AND
THE LAW.
To the client in barrister’s chambers or soli-
citor’s office, and the patient in the consult-
ing-room, these questions must frequently
occur: “Is there a seal of confidence between
us that the law will not break? If I tell
all may it not be to my undoing?” In some
countries the extent to which this confidence
may be secured is determined by the specific
words of the written law, but in England
and Australia the matter rests wholly on
the unwritten or common law. In other
words, it is built on precedents laid down
by judicial authority from time to time. The
legal profession alone has secured for itself
undoubted immunity. The seal of its con-
fidences cannot be broken—except in a few
minor instances that do not come strictly
within the rule. Communications between
a client and his barrister or solicitor are
privileged: that is to say, cannot com-
pulsorily be put in evidence. This exemp-
tion includes all media of communication
between them, and is not confined to verbal
statements. Also it embraces such inter-
mediaries as clerks, interpreters and even
agents. But it does not permit the exclusion
from evidence of facts which the legal
adviser may have learned by any other means
than confidential communication with his
client, though if he had not been employed
by such client he probably would not have
become aware of them. The privilege at-
taches to the client personally, and he may
waive it if he thinks fit. It covers only the
period of employment and its subject-matter.
Should it happen that before the commission
of the offence the client had consulted his
solicitor for the purpose of getting informa-
tion that would guide or help him in the
contemplated commission of a crime or civil
fraud, he cannot subsequently claim what
then passed between them as privileged. Nor
does privilege attach in the case of persons
who have a joint interest with the client in
the subject-matter of the disclosure where
they themselves are not clients. That, in
brief, is the law applicable to lawyers and
their clients, who stand as a privileged class
Medical men and their patients, by our
common law, have no such privilege. Com-
munications to a medical man made in con-
fidence may have the seal of secrecy within
the profession deeply impressed on them, bat
the Court breaks that seal with greater ease
than it would a nutshell. Whether they
should be privileged is a subject of debate,
with much to say in favor of an affirmative
answer. The position of its advocates is
strengthened by the fact that in some other
countries the law, by statute, extends this
consideration. The penal code of France,
for example, enacts the following:—
No person authorised to practise physic or surgery
shall be allowed to disclose any information which he
may have secured in attending any patient in a
professional character, and which information was
necessary to enable him to prescribe for such patient
as a physician, or do any act for him as a surgeon.
The principle upon which our Courts aci
was established many years ago, having been
clearly enunciated in the State trial ot
Elizabeth, calling herself “Duchess Dowager
of Kingston,” in 1776. Elizabeth was
charged with having feloniously married
Evelyn Pierrepont, late Duke of Kingston-
she being then the wife of Augustus John
Hervey, Earl of Bristol. Among the wit-
nesses called for the prosecution was one
Caesar Hawkins, a surgeon,. who objected
to speak up and speak out on the ground
that by so doing professional confidence
would be violated. So it was argued, and
many learned precedents against C/ESARS
objections were quoted. Said Lord Mans-
field, speaking on behalf of their Lordships •
Mr. Hawkins will understand that it is your Lord-
ships’ judgment and opinion that a surgeon has '■
privilege, where it is a material question, in a ci
or criminal cause, to say that his introduction to u 1
parties was in the course of his profession, and tn-
in that way he came to a knowledge of it. * ,
surgeon was voluntarily to reveal these secrets, u
sure he would be guilty of a breach of honor an
great indiscretion, but to give the information ■
court of justice, which by the law of the land
bound to do, will never be imputed to him as
indiscretion whatever. .
Hawkins raised no further objectio •
Elizabeth, found guilty, was given
benefit of the Statutes exempting a conu
person from “being burnt in the hand
imprisoned,” but the Lord High Steward .
marked: “You can never have the like be _
a second time; another offence of the .
kind will be capital.” So stands the Id .
day, though in the great country ’
George 111. lost for us some of the & ti

As to communications made _to spi
advisers, the ground is not quite so .‘ .
though the weight of authority is a &‘ n
privilege. A confession of guilt MBjv eJ .

Is It a Settlement?
r , rTS which have come to light since the
■ settlement” was announced indicate that
,nV local management of the Commonwealth
S inning Line, consisting largely of a rear-
Vlmiral, purchased peace and freedom from
toh-control on very ignominious terms, and
j sn ’t in the least assured that it has got,
S is likely to get, the goods. The award
uliicli T. WALSH tore up when lie cheerfully
Sde the Federal Arbitration Court to de
roister his union and be hanged is still to
bl-binding on the owners. As regards the
long hold-up ships Dilga and Fromanga, it
is alleged that a cessation of hostilities was
bought with £OOO cash, the money to go, as
a reward for striking, to the Volvunma crew
which began the trouble. (This was the
crowd which was tried before a State Court
for breach of Federal law because the Com-
monwealth has no minor courts or police of
it s own, which was put in a State gaol be-
cause the Commonwealth has no gaol of its
own. and which was pardoned by a State
Government because the Commonwealth has
no authority of its own.) T. Walsii, the
non-Australian strike-maker and revolution-
ary, retains his position and his power, and
bis last reported words were to the effect that
job-control exists by law ; wherefore it is
assumed that the promise to abandon it is
waste paper. He and bis friends further
allege that he won’t he deported, and some
of them go so far as to say that the Aus-
tralian-born Prime Minister will. The
matter which outstands is that Brtjce' had
better get out of the shipping business and
sell his ships for what they will fetch.
They have lost millions and are losing
more millions, and they have lost the Minis-
terial dignity and the community’s respect.
The maintenance of the fleet gives much
satisfaction to the Prime Minister’s enemies,
and none to him or his constituents. A wise
man knows when to get out, while a merely
obstinate one doesn’t. Jonah parted with
his whale, despite the absurdly high price of
whales. St. Paul threw away his viper
instead of trying to sell it to a menagerie.
A very ordinary man, having a red-liot poker
bequeathed to him by a rich relative, gener-
ally knows enough to drop the legacy at an
early opportunity. The Prime Minister should
consider these precedents, and cease to waste
the public funds in making himself a cockshy
for a gang of vulgar foreigners and quarrel-
some sundries.

The Asiatic in the East Indies.
A matter that may some day interest Aus-
tralia almost as vitally as white occupation
of the Northern Territory is the question
of yellow occupation of the Dutch East
Indies. The Javanese has no pioneering
qualities. He never achieved any higher
economic system on his own- account than
sitting underneath a kelapa-tree and wait-
ing for the ripening nut to drop. The more
•strenuous Hindu, who in turn got his stimu-
lus from Aryan invaders, gave him any
notion of civilisation he can claim. The
Hindu made the Javanese erect the magni-
ficent temples whose ruins still amaze the
traveller when he first approaches them
through the picturesque but flimsy basket-
work villages of their builders. When Van-
schnapps discovered the Javanese after the
Hindus had departed, he found them waiting
underneath their trees for the nuts to fall
ynee more. He made them build stupendous
irrigation works, bridges and roads instead
"t temples; but if Dutch control were re-
moved the next discoverers would find the
gentle aborigine at his old sylvan address
again. The Hollander has tried for many
years to induce the surplus population of
overcrowded Java to migrate to the fertile
nut empty outer possessions, such as Celebes,
New Guinea and the Moluccas, but without
nie least, success. Nevertheless, this im-
mense area, which in places comes to within
u «ays steam from Australia, is being
steadily settled, and the Dutch census figures

More Patching in the North.
Half-hearted, patchy, apologetic, unsatis-
factory and unfinished are the terms that
describe Minister Pearce’s schemes for the
rehabilitation of the Northern Territory.
The adjectives apply to practically everything
Pearce does, and most of them apply to the
persistent office-holder himself. As his mea-
sures unfold the missed opportunities become
more in evidence. The first news was that
the Territory was to bo saw r n in two, and
provided with a new cargo of Commissioners
with no authority save that of referring
things to Melbourne in the old way. It was
proposed that Westralia (Pearce’s own
State) and Queensland should be invited
to join in the new management, and that
South Australia, which nursed the place for
many years, and then handed it over on con-
ditions which remain wholly unfulfilled,
should not. This was taken to mean that
the monstrous job of a northern east-to-west
railway, to tie together fcjie three emptiest
sections of the continent, had a chance of
fulfilment. Pearce’s awkward alleged fol-
lowers in his own State had practically dis-
qualified him by declaring that their nom-
inees in future must profess the Freetrade
faith, which implied that Pearce must either
seek a seat elsewhere or leave the allegedly
Protectionist Ministry. Then it was
reported that the party in Westralia had
decided to renew its confidence in the P»ad
Luck of the Cabinet, whatever his fiscal
views, and people naturally wondered at the
reason of the change, and the east-to-west
railway was again thought of. The later de-
velopments in the scheme by which the Terri-
tory is to be born again are not more satis-
factory than those which went before. A
dozen or more years back certain theorists
resolved that the way to attract people
into the great immensity was to refuse them
any more than a tenant’s position, and
neither to give nor sell a freehold at any
price. As no one could borrow money for
development purposes on a tenancy, and no
one wanted a tenancy, people didn t come.
They departed. The situation having become
obvious to most people except stupid legis-
lators. and having at last dawned upon them
in a limited way, it is now proposed to do
a little in the freehold line. The individual
settler is to be allowed as much as 1280
acres of good land, or 2560 acres of poor
land, at not less than 2s. 6d. per acre. Town
and suburban lands will, of course, cost
more, and the town-settler is to do a pre-
liminary canter as a leaseholder. But neither
the bili for appointing Commissioners, nor
the one for selling 2560 acres of poor land
for not less than 2s. 6d. per acre, touches
the urgent question as expressed by the
official from Pearce’s own department who
wrote “Census Bulletin No. 7” -
Those speaking with personal knowledge of the
country agree that the foremost conditions for accele-
rated progress are cheapened transport and quickened
communication with the South. With a freight bill
running to something like 2s. 9d. per ton per mile
for goods carried inland, and a postal service by
which a letter from One of the southern States, say
to Newcastle Waters, may take longer than one
from Melbourne to the northern parts of Norway,
there is little hope of progress.
When it costs more than an acre of land
to carry one ton of produce 1760 yards
along the route of the unbuilt railway, what
good is 1280 acres to anybody ? The through
railway should reduce the price to 2d. But,
apparently, the line can’t be built anywhere
without offending people who want it else-
where, or who want. it. nowhere at all, be-
cause they desire to grab the money for other
purposes; so the old trouble is likely to last
as long as shiftless Governments do.

Wind and Water.
“J.H.M.A.” watches and waits: —
Five or six hundred of us stood on the shores of the
little cove on the north side of Botany Bay, close to
which Lai'EROUSk refitted his ill-fated ship 13.7 years
ago, and witnessed —with their hearts in their mouths
one of those checks to Australian pioneering which
have never arrested it long. The mishap which befell
Squadron-Leader Wackett’s new flying-boat Wid-
geon, built in Australia from his own original design,
was simply a piece of bad luck of the sort that pre-
vented George Bass and others from getting across
the Blue Mountains in the first years of this coun-
try’s settlement. It is not unlikely that before these
lines have been seven days in print the gallant and
cheery airman will have demonstrated successfully
that it is possible to build satisfactory seaplanes
cheaply and quickly in Australia, of all-Australian
material, and by means of Australian brains and
hands. Which was what he set out to do. Only the
most unfavorable conditions of wind and water, and
that by the narrowest margin, prevented him from
proving it at his first attempt.
It was a bleak, cold and beastly afternoon, with
rain threatening, and “white horses” racing out in
the big bay. The preliminary trials in the morning,
on the surface of the water, had favorably im-
pressed so competent a judge as Lieut.-Colonel
Brixsmead, Director of Civil Aviation. But the
weather was so bad that .it seemed doubtful whether
any attempt to complete the tests would be made
that day. However, after the seaplane had been
brought to the beach to be christened by Mrs.
Wackett with the usual bottle of champagne, her
designer and pilot decided to proceed with them. The
Widgeon was floated out again, and he went aboard
with Colonel Brixsmead and two mechanics of the
R.A.A.F. The coldness of the day made it a little
difficult to start the engine, and for some time the
two members of the crew toiled strenuously at the
propeller before succeeding. Sundry wet and shiver-
ing assistants stood up to their armpits in the chill
water, and held her in position. At length, how-
ever, the spluttering roar that has become as familiar
as the smell of a motor-car shattered the silence of
expectariey, and the graceful craft shot off across the
cove towards the point that limits it westerly on the
northern side.
We watched from the beach, and wished the Wid-
geon the luck her pilot deserved. And then, after
swooping round in circles on the bay for a little
while, he increased her pace to take her into the air
—and got what he didn’t deserve. In a cloud of
white foam she was heading out southward into
Botany Bay, her nose beginning to lift into flight,
when a long roller heaved under her, and she dived
into the trough and immediately stood on her ‘head.
She had, as it were, been hit between wind and water.
Presently, through glasses, heads could be seen in
the water, and the Air Force’s speed-boat raced to the
spot and picked up their owners. Only the tail-
planes were above the surface, and the cabin seemed
to be almost entirely submerged. That those four
fine Australians were not drowned, and that the
Widgeon herself was very -little damaged, is a pretty
fair omen for the success of her next trial.
Up on the hillside Le Peek Rf.ceveur, Laperouse’s
chaplain and naturalist, buried there, slept through
it all. But as one passed his grave in the dusk came a
reflection that it takes all sorts of brave men to keep
the old world going, and that the good “man of
science and letters ” who lias rested there so long
would have approved of those who had not been lost
in Frenchman’s Bay an hour before.

The Rabble of Foreign-Traders.
Con currently With the ran of railway acci-
dents in Queensland, and the IN'. S. Wales
floods, and the row in Oliina —that is to say,
just because its time has come round —there
has been an epidemic of very poor-quality
Freetrade correspondence in the two older
Sydney morning papers. It is far below
the standard of the George it Eli) days,
partly, it may be, because the combatants are
getting up in years, and partly because the
bright and shining example of the Cold Coun-
try is no longer quoted with the old confi-
dence. One obtuse genius explained that
the local manufacturer should be his own re-
tailer, and then, through the saving of the
retail middleman’s profits, lie could dispense
with Protection. The idea of a soap- or hafc-
and-cap-manufacturer, whose goods arc in,
say, a thousand country stores, making a
fortune by opening a thousand country stores
himself for the sale of his own soap or caps,
and the further idea that the importer
wouldn’t follow suit and grab at the fortune,
are down to the current Freetrade level.
Another eloquent writer stressed the point
that the late Lord Lkveriiulme, visiting Aus-
tralia in his declining days, said that “any
industry which needed artificial protection
should 'not be fostered.” The same might
be said of any baby. A pile of Freetrade.
correspondence of a very angry sort was
written in the alleged interests of the Coun-
try party, some of which has become very
much unballasted of late. The farmers re-
ceive a subsidy of some £ 1 ~°>oo,ooo in a single
year in N. S. Wales alone through the car
i-iage of agricultural produce on the State
railways below cost, and the wilder Cocky
members badly want to destroy the tariff
revenue which makes this concession pos-
sible. The position of the Labor people is
complicated. They want shorter hours of
work and, in some eases, higher wages as
well. Leaders of the Lang type declare that
less work for the same pay, or more pay fot
the same work, doesn’t increase the cost of
production. Therefore, more work for the
same pav, or for less pay, doesn’t reduce the
cost. The unavoidable inference is that the
need for Protection against “the products of
sweated labor” and against “the long-hour
and low-wage foreigner” is only a figure of
speech, for apparently the doing of double
work for the same pay gives the foreigner
no advantage, after all. So it will.be only
logical if Labor joins up with the importer
and the country landlord, and makes the
Freetrade circle complete.

The Tarrying Telegram.
“Retired Volt” in reply:—
“Ex-Telegraphist” (B. 9/7/’25) makes an odd
suggestion when he proposes that, in order to facilitate
business on the Commonwealth’s antediluvian tele-
graph service, clerks should be given the power to
grade traffic according to what they consider is its
relative importance. His own preferences show what
human prejudices would make of the notion, illness,
commerce and sport come before domestic and social
matters in his list, and “miscellaneous” presumably
includes press matter. There are plenty of people
who would regard putting sport third instead of first
as little less than impious, and most telegraphists
apparently agree with them, because the finest cable
and telegraph records have always been, made in the
transmission of Melbourne Cup or English Derby
results.
As one who had an intimate and bitter experience
of control as irresponsible as that advocated by
“Ex -Telegraphist” I rise in protest. When the
war broke out, hordes of well-meaning patriots were
removed from office-counters or honorable retirement
and inflicted on all the cable stations of the
Empire as censors. These autocrats had power to
do precisely what “Ex-Telegraphist” suggests. They
graded traffic in what they considered was the
order of its importance, and when a particular
message earned their hostility they fell on it m
a body and exterminated it altogether. Business
men have an inkling, but the public will never
know, what the commerce of the country suffered
through the operations of this secret cabal. It was
very difficult, for instance, to convince a censor,
appointed perhaps because he had been a prominent
member of a country rifle club, that a cable about
an advance in the price of wool might be as vital
to the progress of the war as a communique from
Athens or Helsingfors recording purely mythical
advances of the Russian steam-roller. The cable
companies, which have had 50 3’ears of experience
of pushing traffic through congested channels, have
never found a better method of giving preference
to the more important classes than by varying
charges. A triple instead of a double rate for
urgents insures that that class of telegrams is almost
exclusively reserved for important business; and if
a husband here and there thinks his love and kisses
to his wife are wojrtjj Bs. a word, he is entitled
in a democratic country to indulge his folly.
Nor does the International Convention, to which Aus-
tralia is a signatory, advocate any better method of
grading telegrams than, like other goods, in the
order of their price; except, in the ease of Govern-
ment business, which, quite properly, gets precedence.
There is a''remedy for the miserable service the
Commonwealth' gives to the users of its telegraphs,
but it does not lie in granting unlimited power to
an understrapper to hold up a citizen’s communi-
cations according to his own sweet fancy’. It lies
in the multiplication of circuits and the proper
development of automatic working, which is a policy
favored by Britain, where even urgent telegrams are
considered undemocratic. Since, however, even a
multitude of circuits are equally inarticulate when
they are strung on the same pole if the pole falls
down, and since heavy storms wall interrupt even
the best land-line equipment,'as well as make wireless
unworkable, some of the new circuits might be
laid under water around the coast. Cables are
expensive, but a £500,000 submarine wire has
already been considered necessary to bring Newcastle
and beyond within. easier swearing distance of
Sydney’s telephone attendants. The telegraph system
needs improvement" just' ai badly. It is a reflection
on our national sanity and resource that Sydney
should be in closer and more regular touch with
U.S.A. than it is with Melbourne, and that Perth
should be further away from Adelaide than it is
from London. This is giving a fine advantage to
the foreign trader, while putting the Australian
manufacturer under a disastrous handicap. Also if
an invader arrived off Sydney in his might, the
Defence authorities in Melbourne would, under present
conditions, probably have to be advised of the circum-
stance by post.

The Poor Man’s Lawyer.
In 1918 the N. S. Wales Parliament passed
the Poor Persons Legal Remedies Act, and
the intermediate years have tested the efli-
cacy of the legislation. The intention of
the statute was to provide legal assistance
without cost for necessitous persons who had
proper grounds of action or defence. A
very worthy object, as all will admit who
know the circumstances which sometimes
accompany the efforts of the poor but honest
litigant to establish a just cause or uphold
a valid defence. The principle was sound;
but it soon became questionable whether the
machinery set up adequately functioned.
Tightly bound in red tape, the system is
cumbrous in administration, and it is more
than doubtful whether it provides adequate
checks against abuse. The duty of in-
quiring into both the means of the
applicant and the grounds of his action
or defence is delegated to the Legal
Aid Office. That office reports to the
Court whether, and on what terms, the appli-
cant ought to be admitted as a party to
legal proceedings. If the Judge sees lit on
this report to so admit the applicant, lie
may assign counsel or solicitor, or both, to
act in the matter and assist him in the con-
duct of the proceedings. A list, of counsel
and solicitors willing to thus act without
remuneration is kept, and, apart from pay-
ment of out-of-pocket expenses, the assigned
gent, one may only, under exceptional cir-
cumstances. be allowed a fee. As a rule,
no fee is forthcoming, and thus the legal
fraternity becomes linked to that of medicine
and surgery by generous assistance to the
impoverished man in need of advice and
help. During the reign of the Fuller
Government Attorney-General Ravin caused
a memorandum to be prepared by the Com-
missioner for Law Reform on the working
of the Act. This memorandum was duly
drawn up and presented. It stated in effect
that the existing system had not been a suc-
cess, owing to its own defects. The out-
standing difficulty appeared to be to provide
sufficient safeguards against abuse. That
the Legal Aid Office has had to meet in-
geniously-contrived abuses of the law. both
as to the means of applicants and the justice
of their causes, is generally known, but how
to check these attempts is a far from easy
problem. One means that has been sug-
gested is the creation of a Board consisting
of members drawn from both branches of the
profession and presided over by a Judge of
either the Supreme or District Courts to
deal with all applications, making due in
qniry into means and determining whether
the facts disclosed constitute a good claim
or defence in law, and generally to super-
vise the working of the Legal Aid Office.
Obviously this duty of adequate inquiry
cannot be carried out at present by the
Judge in person; he must rely on* the re-
ports of the office. The proposed scheme
suggests a formidable multiplication of
machinei*y. Still, whatever the means taken
may be. it is clear that if this Act, with an
object beyond reproach, is being used or
attempted to be used by persons who have
no just claim to its benefits, action should
not be delayed in providing a remedy. The
new Attorney-General can find all the neces-
sary information filed in his department;
and as the Act is one which most closely
affects the interests of the section of the
community that his party professes to
represent, he should not delay in calling for
it and drafting any necessary" legislation. It
is only fair to assume that the Labor Gov-
ernment is as concerned in preventing the
abuse of the system by unqualified persons
as were its opponents; otherwise it would
be better to have a clean declaration of free
law for all and be done with it.

A Vision of 1950.
The health officer of Sydney has warned the
political and municipal heavy fathers in-
volved that they should stand by and be pre-
pared for great doings. Twenty-five years
hence the Ma State metropolis, judging by
its recent and present rate of growth, is to be
a city of 2,900,000 inhabitants—or 3,000,000.
for round figures are easier. This will almost
certainly make it the second mass of popu-
lation in an empire which covers one-fourth
of the habitable globe, and far ahead of all
other aspirants to the honor, for at last
census no other imperial city, not even Lon-
don, was growing at the same pace. The
forecast of future greatness is apparently
based on estimates and figures like these

ditions, which is evidently the idea on which
the prophecy is built, it will be mostly located
in the County of Cumberland, though the
adjacent County of Northumberland, where
the coalmines are, may have a look in. And
by 1950, assuming a continuance of the con-
ditions shown by last census, half the State
will have practically no population at all.
The city has grown in the past by swallowing
the country inhabitants, and if it is to con-
tinue growing as foreshadowed it must con-
tinue swallowing. On the proportions
shown by last census, out of the suggested
increase between now and 1950 Cumber-
land County should take about 2,200,000, and
the big balance of the State the other
092,000. It is a sketch of abnormal growth,
reminiscent of the article on Elephantiasis
Arabum or Cochin Leg in the encyclopaedia,
which tells how one small organ may grow
to the weight of lewt. or more, so that the
patient can only move by rolling, and even
then can ofily roll a yard or so per dsy. The
general i*emedy is secession of the rest of
the body by surgery. The Sydney health-
officer urges immediate and vigorous town-
planning in preparation for the future, but

hotel as worthy of your patronage.

'i ruiVm?, 1 ® matter to lay out a new city of
1.. MX),000 people, and a bigger matter
it on to an old city of
I.<XX),OOO people which is in urgent need of
reconstruction itself, and it is a pity there
arc not more people to face the job. But,
after all, the wonderful spectacle of London's
competitor for the position of the real im-
perial city rising against a background of
sheep and little bits of agriculture may never
happen. The year 1950 may find Sydney
very little larger than it is now. When
new States are carved out of N. S. Wales,
either peacefully, or the way old Israel and
recent Norway did it, there will be rival capi-
tals and rival ports. Nothing but absurdly
inefficient government can prevent them be-
coming the centres of a rush of population,
after the manner of fresh goldfields. Then
most of the people who now migrate from the
country to Sydney may migrate to newer
cities, and many who migrated to Sydney
in past years may leave to see what the new*
rush is like as a field for speculation. The
picture of the city of 50 years hence depends
partly on a continuance of loan money, and
mostly on the assumption that the Sydney
enipire will last, that the policy of keeping
rival ports closed will last, and that it is
possible to put a bigger and bigger propor-
tion of the population of a great State into
one city and its environs, woi*ld without end,
amen. It is a good deal to assume.

Gum-leaves and Cherries,
“L.E.” puts in his plea:—
It was in the train that runs through Eastern
Gippsland from Bairnsdale to Orbost that I met a
quiet-looking man of about 50, a typical bushman,
tough and wiry and burnt brown by sun and wind.
It is said that a little way out of Bairnsdale the
“country” ends and the “bush” begins. For some
miles there was “settled country,” with many pad-
docks of dead, white trees, and then the train crossed
the Mitchell and Nicolson rivers and came on to
the Tambo River flats. The Tambo River flats,
the quiet man explained, with the Orbost flats, were
the best maize-growing land in Victoria, worth
£l5O an acre. He spoke in that low, soft voice
characteristic of bushmen. He was a cattleman with
“a bit of country” up the Snowy. When the train
left Bruthen it passed through a magnificent forest.
As I was looking out of the window at this extra-
ordinary scene, with its stark grey trees, deep fern
gullies and wild undergrowth, a fragment of a
primitive world, older than Europe, the bushman
quietly remarked: “Picnic country I” I turned and
saw a sly look in his grey, far-seeing eyes. “Gum-
leaves ! ” he said slowly and scornfully, obviously for
my benefit. Then: “Do you know, people sometimes
come out here and pick gum-leaves,. and send them
to Melbourne! If they were cherries now! But
gum-leaves! Some people like ptm-leaves! ” He
paused a moment, plunged in thought, then muttered
“It’s wonderful.”
But it seems still more wonderful to me how a
man who had lived all his life in the bush, and
wouldn’t be away from it for the world, prided him-
self on his lack of sentiment. Who could imagine
a Highlander hating the heather hills or an Irishman
cursing his damned shamrocks? But my bushman
companion hated gum-leaves and gum-trees. He
preferred cherries.
National sentiment must be a slow growth; for,
though we have improved on the days of Gordon
and Marcus ClaßKb, many people still prefer cherries
to anything that is our very own. Every little
wildflower in England has had its meed of praise
from generations of poets and singers, and is
familiar to every child. Many of our loveliest bush
flowers are still nameless. Our native animals, the
gentlest of Wild things, are in a worse plight. It
is still considered good fun to run dowri kangaroos,
and skin-hunting is a profitable business. ’Possum
skins are collected in many parts of the bush
where hunters, amateur and professional, set their
traps and snares, and know how to dodge the few
policemen who occasionally made a raid. Even the
little koala has been pursued so relentlessly, more
than 2,000,000 being killed in a year, that a wide
appeal has been made to the public to save it from
extinction.' Apart from their general interest, all
these animals have a unique scientific value, and
European and American scientists envy Australia’s
opportunities of making important researches. Even
our once despised blackfellow has been shown to
be a person of interest and importance. No one
would dare nowadays to write such stupid and dis-
gusting lines as those on a black gin by Brunton
Stephens. A world-authority like Professor Elliot
Smith considers it is our duty and privilege to
collect and study his beliefs and customs and tradi-
tions, which are of profound anthropological and
human interest, before it is too late.
Certainly an effort is being made to familiarise our
school-children with the life of nature around theni.
And bad as our present vandalism may be, it is
less devastating than in the past. Our wattle-
blossom and birds and animals are at least and in
places officially protected. But fear of the law
is a poor substitute for a genuine national senti-
ment that appreciates the beauty and significance of
the Big- Bush, with its trees and birds and strange
wild creatures, wonderful as any in the world and
peculiarly Australian.

A Need for Federal Courts.
The Bruce-Page Government would do well
to study Clause 71 of the Constitution and
consider whether there is profit therein. The
amending Immigration Act, if properly
administered, should save the Government
from destruction at the coming election, but
the apparatus of administration looks a trifle
scanty. Under Clause 71 the Commonwealth
has power to create all manner of courts for
all manner of purposes, but the power, like
many others, has been much neglected. It
can imitate the United States, with its 81
Federal districts (in addition to Circuit
Courts of Appeal and Supreme Court), for
the trial of all offences against the laws of
the Commonwealth, and thus get the neces-
sary conviction against the industrial dis-
turber before its own Judge, instead of rely-
ing too much on the kind of Judge or magis-
trate that a possibly hostile State crowd may
supply. One of the tragic farces of the long-
drawn-out shipping insurrection was the per-
formance which centred round the Federal
s.s. Volumnia at Fremantle. The crew was
ordered ashore by State disturbers. Federal
officials were grossly interfered with in the
performance of their duties by a State mob.
At this juncture the police, being a State
institution, gave no protection against
violence because the State Ministry remained
torpid and gave no orders. The Federal
troops, such as there were, couldn’t legally
protect anybody unless the State Ministry
asked them to do so, which it didn’t. When
a local Court passed a small sentence on
the deserters for breach of the Federal law
the State Government liberated them on the
ground that it had a right to do as it pleased
with its own Court. The final scene was
the arrest of the Federal Government’s much-
injured skipper on a trumped-up charge, at
the instance of State officials, and his ap-
pearance before a N. S. Wales State Court,
EVOLUTION.
“The possibility of Mr. Theodore becoming Governor of Queensland is being discussed.”

All this suggests a sinful lack of grit about
Federal law methods.
.Managing -Maoriland.
From the Maoriland Press Gallery:—
The Maoriland Press plumped pry tty solidly for
Joseph Gordon Coates as: the next best thing to
Massey, and the caucus of the Reform party pushed
him almost protestingly into the big man's shoes.
Over this way we like a man who is young and
gruff and bullying; and if the man has brains, sc
much the better. Whatever Coated may be as a
politician or even perhaps as a leader, one does not
gather much of it from his speech. His oratory
is jerky, somewhat colorless and very often con-
tradictory, though his words have a certain potency.
He has an. amazing sang froid that would carry him
through the stormiest seas of interjection, but he
never really makes port—only calm waters. The
public likes hirn for the man that he is: likes that
‘Tm-the-cock-o’-the-walk” gait of his, his free
and easy manner and his contempt for trivial tactics.
There is no one in the Ministerial ranks who ever
made a promise more reluctantly. Physically, he is
big, and any ignoramus is likely to thifik that he
owns the Parliamentary building by the way he
struts about in it; but he could never develop into
the really great leader that Massey was. Massey
was patient where Coates is impatient; Massey did
his best to placate Oppositionists, whereas Coates is
a “take-it-or-leave-it” man.
Meanwhile Dowxie Stewart is coming back to
health. Here is a brainy man, sane thinker and
brilliant political economist. And he will be off
crutches in a month or so. As a representative at
the Imperial Conference he would have no equal;
but the question of transit is a big one in so far as
human freight is concerned.
Overtures have been made by the Liberals to the
Reformers to form a National party, a coalition oi
a fusion of some sort, and Coates seems to favor
accepting the olive branch. What he should do is
go to the country immediately instead of risking his
head in the noose of a no-confidence motion.

‘‘Sol. Malaprop” : The passing in several
States of George Washington’s country of
freak statutes against the teaching of the
doctrine of evolution, and prescribing strict
adhesion to the Creation story of Genesis,
represents one of Uncle Sam’s theoretical
brain-waves of anti-niggerism. It does no-
thing, good or bad, to the nigger, but it is
the assertion of a principle. The theory is
that white American man must not be
allowed to be descended (or ■ascended) from
a monkey, or to have a monkey in his pedi-
gree, because the animal was probably brown
or black. He must come straight from Adam
and Eve, who are assumed to have been pure
white, though no one can prove it, and though
they were Asiatics. It is also assumed that
the women whom Seth and hjs male de-
scendants married were all white; in fact,
many things are assumed. It is not gen-
erally known that Adam, in his later prime,
when lie had stored up much wisdom, wrote
a theological work of great size and learn-
ing. Eve predeceased him, and his sons and
daughters scattered, leaving him a lonely old
man. On his death-bed he did the only thing
possible, and entrusted the manuscript to
the Devil, wdio promised faithfully to look
after it. This he did for many centuries,
till at last he either gave or sold the price-
less relic to a Russian monastery, where it
was exhibited to the devout. Being w-ritten
in Slavonic it was intelligible, but it was
never published- in book form. It was pro-
bably lost in the revolution. This legend,
which Is as good as many other legends,
should interest U.S. legislators.

From S. Della Vecchia, secretary of the
Italian club at Mourilyan (Q.) :
The writer of “Clouds in the North” (B. 28/5/’2sj
had clouds in tax north when he asserted that “the
Italian club at Mourilyan is a Fascist organisation,”
and that there was “a very big and very secret
meeting-,” after which “it became known that
every gun in the shops had been sold, mostly
to Italians.” Such statements could only have come
from an ignorant and unprincipled person. In his hatred
of Italians “Clouds” forgets many things. To the Italian
Marconi the world owes the greatest scientific inven-
tion it has ever known. In the struggle for Liberty
half a million Italians, the flower of Italy’s sons,
fell side by side with her Allies. Italians have
played an honorable part in the development of
Queensland. Innisfail might still be a muddy and
feverish place were it not for us Italians, w-ho
helped to a very large extent to clear the soil from
its vast tropical jungle and made it productive.
To-day it is known as the Million-Pound Town.
The Italians are good settlers and staunch unionists.
They do not loaf about the streets, living on Gov-
ernment rations; on the contrary, they work hard,
observe the laws and pay their way. The Italian
club at Mourilvan is a real club and not a political
organisation. So far from its members being Fascisti,
from 90 to 95 per cent, of the Italians in Queens-
land are either true Socialists or have socialistic
sentiments. “Clouds” mentions Under-Secretary
Ferry. That gentleman, in his report to the State
Government on the social and economic effects of alien
immigration in North Queensland, states that the
Italians are thrifty, industrious, law-abiding and
honest in business transactions. Lot it go at that.

“Notsellor” : Now that proportional repre-
sentation or whatever one likes to call the
involved system which decides who shall have
the right to misgovern N. S. Wales is on the
edge of the melting-pot, I suggest that our
whole electoral system be pushed in. I am,
say, a woolgrower; but it is only by acci-
dent that there is a member of Parliament
who knows anything about growing wool.
The same might be said of any other indus-
try or calling or profession. To ensure that
I shall be really represented in Parliament,
representation should be by industries and
not by districts. It would mean re-
vising the rolls by adding to each name the
industry each elector follows, and by allowing
him to vote only for one or more of the can-
didates standing in the interests of that in-
dustry. The number of seats allotted to each
industry would be governed by the'’capital
invested or by the number of persons em-
ployed, or by a scale taking both factors into
consideration. The bigger concerns, such as
woolgrowing, would need to be territorially
subdivided also, and smaller industries and
professions would have to be lumped together
to keep the number of members at a workable
figure. Professional politicians would tend to
disappear under this scheme, and that is pro-
bably one very good reason why it will be
resisted.

“Canar” : Of a batch of young criminals
recently dealt with in one of the Sydney
courts every one had previously been con-
victed in the Children’s Court, some of them
more than once. Theoretically, the juvenile
court is a place in which youthful offenders
may have it impressed upon them that law r s
are made to be kept without bringing them
into contact with the unpleasant associa-
tions of the police court. It is an entirely
commendable purpose, but over-leniency
is having some disastrous effects. It is the
usual thing in the Children’s Court to dis-
charge not only first but second and even
third offenders w T ith a warning and a few-
kind words. Hence the idea in the minds
of many youthful transgressors that they
may commit at least two offences witli im-
punity. Another factor which isn’t working
out as w-as intended is the entire absence
of publicity. The offender has come to
realise that he runs very little risk of any
penalty more severe than an admonition,
and even this will not be obtruded on the
public. The consequence is- that the youth
of the type with which the court was in-
tended to deal is being very doubtfully
advantaged.

“Feng-Shui” : The possibility that a near
descendant of Pithecanthropus ereetns, the
ape-man relation of the Australian aboriginal
whose skull and oddments w 7 ere found in
Java in 1802, still roosts in the treescape of
the neighboring island of Sumatra is prompt-
ing the. setting out of three scientific expe-
ditions shortly. ,T. van Herwaarden, a
Dutch explorer, claims to have seen the crea-
ture, which was entirely covered with hair,
had a somewhat pointed head, high forehead,
dark and lively eyes, negroid nose, broad
mouth, unusually large molar teeth and long
arms that reached almost to its knees : never-
theless, he found its expression pleasing and
not in the least ape-like. Unless he met a
particularly wild specimen of the orang-
kubu, the aboriginal of those parts, what the
herr probably saw was his ow-n reconstruc-
tion of the popular Malay legend of the w-ild
man of the jungle. These, creatures are the
offspring of mesalliances between native
women stolen from their beds and the orang-
outang, a term, by the way, which means
jungle-man and is not used by the Malays
to describe the monkey of the Indies. This
slander on the morals of one of the most
pacific of animals is a very ancient traveller's
tale. Hanno. the Carthaginian explorer,
found' an island on the African West Coast
inhabited by hairy women who were called
gorillao, also a word that means wild-men:
and the satyr of the Greeks was the same
prodigy. The furthest west the legend pene-
trated was to Kent, there being a belief on
the Continent up to the time of Thomas
a'Beckett that that lovely county was in-
habited by men w-ith tails. As the pet haunts
of the fable were successively invaded by
exploring white men jt retreated eastwards;
I heard it last in Labuan, North Borneo,
from an old Tutong who had lost a new and
beautiful young wife in this dramatic way—
actually she had bolted with a Chinaman.
When rubber has opened up Borneo suffici-
ently to let the daylight in, the yarn will pro-
bably move on to China. China already has
a district w r here the women give birth in
equal numbers to girls and dogs.

POLITICAL
POINTS
For a weary procession of days the bill
authorising the deportation of
criminals and conspirators klraggjed along in
the House of Reps. Then opposition was
poor and perfunctory, but, of course, long-
winded. It was an open secret fihat a fair
number of Laborites- would! gladly have de-
clared in favor of the measure, Ond one of
them (Ogden, of Tasmania!) did, for there
is no great pleasure in beinjg browbeaten by
immigrants who take their tVom Mos-
cow; but a majority of 'the caucus ruled
that they must stand up Tor their tyrants.
Judging by the depressed! character* of the
debate even the majority ‘(began to Atink it
had backed the erroneous hbrse, and ifVPifimo
Minister Bruce had cut the declaration
short, and saved some (Oppositionists* the
necessity of holding fortli, he might {have
earned silent gratitude. Pint Bruce, wn|p is
a mild whale for popularity, hated to' be
unkind, and time rolled on. Meanwhile the
tariff reform question was held up indefi-
nitely. At latest reports. 40 per cent, of
the looms in Australian factories were idle
because of cheap foreign col npetition, and the
situation isn’t improving labile Brnee prae
tises superfluous airs and graces.
The clique in control A>V the N. S. Wales
A.W..U. had another strike of misfortune
when Bill Lambert, M.jtljß., was beaten in
ilie West Sydney selei'tijniK-ballot by English,
the Sydney alderman. Lambert, who was
Gaud Mayor of Sydney- before lie succeeded
to the late Tom Ryan’s. Ijbderal seat, had a
great reputation for sagacity when he posed
as the Silent Man of ulie '.Movement, but in
an infatuated moment he decided to make
speeches like the other-' ehafis. and that was
the beginning of the 'end. The customary
“irregularities” are alleged.
At Brisbane recently a meat employee
was fined the sdzeabke sunv of £5 for non-
attendance at union nueetings. It reads like
a variant of the old I-lnglisli) Jaw about com-
pulsory attendance at churdh, which proved
so expensive that some mttcllk-fiiXed and mueh-
imprisoned absentees, including the ex-York-
shire squire Fawkes, tried to blow up the
whole Parliamentary institution. An attempt
to collect the fine by process of law failed
for the time, not on the ground that non-
attendance was no crime, but because the
magistrate held that defendant should have
been heard in his defence. So he will pro-
bably be heard and then fined something
extra.
Vic. Treasurer Peacock will have a surplus
of slightly more than £lOO,OOO for 1924-25.
He is finding it easier to explain away a
credit balance than to apologise for a deficit.
At present he will only admit that he has
£79,000 to the good—£s3,ooo from general
revenue and £26,000 from railways—but esti-
mates made a week after the close of the
financial year are invariably revised. Under
the Audit Act accounts may be adjusted and
reconciled in July, and accurate figures will
not be available till the first week in August.
Still, Peacock was able to tell Parliament
that the income-tax produced far more than
was anticipated, because of the squeezing pro-
cess applied and the more expeditious work
done by assessors. But for Treasury pay-
ments to the railways of £298,000 for non-
paying lines, and the reduction of rates on
farming products, Clapp and co. would have
had a deficit of £272,000, instead of a sur-
plus of £26,000. Uppah Chambah members
are shaking hands with themselves for hav-
ing compelled Peacock in December to prune
severely his income-tax proposals. All the
same, the pruning was badly botched, and
irritating anomalies were created.
Some Lithgow (N.S.W.) ironworkers got
wild the other night and resolved that unless
THE SKELETON THAT WON’T STAY PUT.
“Although it was dismissed in a couple of lines in the Vic. Governor’s speech at the opening of
the State Parliament, Premier Allan is going to find the matter of Redistribution of Seats the thorniest
item of a dangerous session.”
Prime Minister Bruce dropped his bill autho-
rising the deportation of foreign ruffians
lie would be deported under his own law as
soon as Labor got a turn at office. Bruce,
as an Australian by birth, couldn’t come
under the law, but possibly the excited crowd
didn’t know that, or much else. Anyhow, the
idea of sending Australian citizens into exile
because their political opponents dislike their
opinions has been started on its first innings.
The Westralian Labor Conference made a
scrap of history when it demanded the release
of one Callanan, who is doing a sentence for
robbery under arms on the goldfields. Calla-
nan pleaded that his action wasn’t robbery
because he was an enthusiastic Communist.
Apparently he took the plunder for distribu-
tion among the community, and forgot to dis-
tribute it. There was much debate as to whether
the 44-hour week, when it is compulsory all
round, shall be worked on 5 days or 54
days, and it was held that when 44 hours is
really achieved a dash should be made for
40 hours. Meanwhile Westralia is pottering
along with its claim to be compensated by
its smaller and less golden relatives for its
losses through Federation.
Ogden, the Tas. Labor Senator, has been
threatened with assault as well as expulsion
if he persists in his determination to sup-
port the deportation clauses of the new
Immigration Bill. In the vanguard of the
expulsionists are “comrades” who made them-
selves very scarce when Speck Labor wanted
Senate candidates three years ago. There
was an enthusiastic rush to avoid the appa-
rently hopeless contract, and Ogden was left
to take it on alone in circumstances which
seemed to give him no chance in the world.
For every Laborite who voted for him had
to distribute two votes among the Nation-
alists —there were three Senators to be
elected, and plumping was barred. Great
was the chagrin of certain chicken-hearted
“comrades” when Ogden got 20,130 out of
46,470 effective No. 1 votes, and was elected
before Hays and the late Bakhap. He is not
the kind of man to let threats worry him,
nor are the electors at all likely to put him
on their index for voting according to his
conscience on a subject vital to the Speck.
Dear Bulletin, —The writer of “The State
as Station-owner” (B. 9/7/’25) omitted some
of the case about the Queensland Govern-
ment and its bullock enterprises; but then
there is so much case that some of it is
always being missed. It is quite correct that
the Government owned, before it parted with
Dillalah station, less than 34 per cent, of
the cattle, and less than 1 per cent, of the
horses in the State, and no sheep or pigs—
in other words, that there was a great deal
more fuss and advertisement than genuine
socialistic cow. But the total loss on the
muddled tinpot cattle-show written off to
date is £978,540, the ever-recurrent hole in
the bottom of the concern having been
plugged four times—in 1922, ’23, ’24 and ’25.
Presumably a fifth hole is starting, and the
Treasury is running short of plug.—Yours,
etc., Bildad.
The Labor party is always ready to split
the welkin with yells of “victimisation” if a
street-cleaner is sacked. Yet immediately it
assumed office in N. S. Wales it set up a
reign of terror among civil servants who have
incurred its displeasure. Among the first-
fruits of Labor administration is the en-
forced resignation of B. S. Stevens, Under-
Sec. to the Treasury and Director of
Finance. There are few brainier public ser-
vants in Australia, but he is supposed to
have been responsible for a small retrench-
ment scheme when Fuller was Premier, so
out he goes.
The shipping situation :
Hurried steps were taken last week to explain
that the marine trouble was over, and everybody had
reformed, and the leopard changed his spots. The
shipowners were to give way on the final point in
dispute, and pledge themselves in writing to observe
the terms and conditions of the award which Thomas
Walsh, the seamen’s president, had formally torn up
and repudiated. Previously they had observed '‘t,
but without any written pledge. N.S.W. Premier
Lang, who posed as the author of the “settlement,”
said proudly; “You can take my word for it, that
this means the end of job-control. There will be
peace at last on the water-front.” But the old
crowd of revolutionaries and job-controllers remained
in office, and within a few days a lot more Australian
steamers had been held up, to the. huge delight of
foreigners whose cheap-labor ships are never interfered
with. While the marine transport group acted credit-
ably in repudiating job-control for its own part, the
inclusion of Garden, Communist aandidate and
Moscow pilgrim, as a peace negotiator was a bad
blunder which created the worst impression. Clearly
the cherished idea of turning Australia into a Soviet
republic, with Garden and Walsh and ‘ Johanson and
their kith and kin in the places of profit and honor,
isn’t abandoned because suburban estate-agent Lang
has spoken some pacifying words.
Four of the five Vic. Parliamentarians who
inquired into the question of handling grain
in bulk advocate a £3,500,000 scheme pro-
viding for elevators at 132 country stations
and at Williamstown and Geelong. Subject
to breakwater extensions, they also favor
one at Portland. Oman, the fifth member,
who as Cabinet Minister ran the wheat pool
for three years or more, is dead against the
bulk system. He fears that it would be
excessively costly and little used. Reading
between the liris, it is easy to see that his
chief dread is fihat the taxpayers would have
to provide heavy subsidies, in addition to
their enforced contributions to secure cheap
railway rates for cockies. The Composite
Ministry is nonv between the Devil and the
deep sea. If it ignores the report it will
displease Weaver, the Cocky, and if it adopts
the recommendation of the majority it will
offend Oman, who is a power among the
country Libs.
Window-dressing is one of the accomplish-
ments of the Vic. Composite Cabinet, judg-
ing by the eiaborate display it made last
week, llis l{x. was required to broadcast
just on ISSQ words to crack up a lot of
second-hand goods and treat them as if they
were new Stock. Almost fresh were the
proposal to give a tenure of five years for
a voluntary wheat pool, with a guarantee
of 75 p.c. of values, and the scheme for
spending £2);000,000 a year on road-construc-
tion and niiintenance. Superannuation for
State employees on a contributory basis
and better donditions for some teachers were
promised, afnd the creation of a commission
to recast Aj&sembly seats was hinted at rather
than The handing over of metropolitan
arterial rdjads and bridge construction and
upkeep to 'the Board of (Water and Sewer-
age) Works, and the purchase of the Metro-
politan Gfhs Company’s works for a public
trust to mantage were the little bits of fluff
titivated, for city folk. It would take Parlia-
ment tjhree years to handle all the stuff
offered, but the carry-over will do to decorate
other windows in the future.
“ll*. Hardlupp”: Melbourne Housewives’
Assignation ijs putting up a strenuous agita-
tion for “kerb markets.” It isn’t that the ladles
liayh any sympathy with socialism, but. they
want cheap vegetfjbles and fruit; and they
are irritated because muncipal councils,
which have to lofok to rent-paying shop-
keepers for rates ntnji votes, oppose the kerb-
selling. In some places the difficulty lias
been solved by members of the association
giving the use off vacant allotments for
market purposes, nut the Housewives are
demanding that the! Government shall compel
the municipalities rto sanction street-selling.
One lady who glided into the controversy
went further than 'that; she thinks the Gov-
ernment should cqfcnpel growers to sell only
at kerb-markets. Among those who ap-
plauded the idea were at least two ladies
whose husbands rnj.i large drapery stores, and
who would need fijrst aid if it were proposed
that softgoods-mefichants ansd -manufacturers
should only sell their goods through itinerant
hawkers.
THE MARTYR.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
“Mr. Hughes states that the deportation of Walsh
and other Communists would make martyrs of
them. Mr. Walsh in a newspaper article declares that
the very first act of a Federal Labor Government
must be to see that those deported under' the pro-
posed law are returned to Australia and indemnified
for the outrage put upon them.”
Oh, strait is the way of the martyr and rocky the
road of the saint,
With grief as their only guerdon and terror their
lives to taint;
ilot sands of the red arena, cold stones of the
market-place
Have their tales to tell of the brave that fell for love
of their land and race.
For this is the world’s abasement, let this be its
bitter shame,
That the best of its sons it tortures and kills w-hom
it may not tame;
And stones there are still for prophets, the selfless
reformers of men,
And a Super-Bolsh, a reforming Walsh, is deported,
they say, now and then.
Oh, long is the list and bloody of those who have
died for the light
That shone from a distant Godhead through the murk
of a heathen night,
Sustained in their lasting anguish, through tortures
unholy and grim,
By the thought of a crown from the skies let down
and of gifts that were stored with Him ;
And many a soul heroic has fought for no other gain
Than lay in a moment’s power to comfort its fellows’
pain ;
Then gladly resigned the burden and welcomed the
long, cold sleep—
And to-day there’s Tom, who was erst a “Pom.,” to
stir you and make you weep.
But hearken, you Labor leaders, and list all the leal
and true • *
(For when you have come to office ’twill surely he
up to you),
Though glowing the later glory a,sd bright as ,a halo
burns,
They’re a trifle cold for a martyr bold who is look-
ing for quick returns.
Let none in his ardent worship, in his zeal to
canonise
The hero w'ho suffers for him, forget there’s an
earthly prize.
I'nselfish, of course, the spirit that the martyr’s
crown attains,
‘'till, a martyx-ed Walsh, be he ne’er so Bolsli, will
expect to be paid for his pawns.
VICTOEIA.

“Ex-Dig.": Among recent recipients of
a low-grade birthday honor was a man who
had given countless pints of blood for trans-
fusion purposes to a Txmdon hospital. There
was never any difficulty in finding A.I.F.
WILLING TO WAIT.
"I'm sorry, Bertie, to disappoint you, hut I became
engaged to Dick last night.”
"Well, how about next week?”
men for this purpose; many came forward
doubtless in the sacred cause of mateship,
but there was a very tangible quid pro quo
as well in the form of leave for those who
were ready to have their veins opened to
save others’ lives. Sydney has a Digger who
attributes his present deplorable taste for
alcohol to blood transfusion from a boozy
battalion mate who specially volunteered
for the sacrifice. The man for whom the
sacrifice was made insists that before that
operation he was a non-drinker—even when
he consumed his rum rations it was with a
wry face, as one who gulps down nauseous
medicine—but the moment he left hospital
craving for alcoholic stimulant began to
make itself felt. I don’t know whether a
board of medical experts would accept his
contention.
“X.N.0.”: The story of the N.T. magis-
trate who added his own butcher’s bill to a
fine inflicted on a wayward Celestial re-
minds me of an occasion when the position
was reversed. The head of the biggest naval-
outfitting firm in England was one John Gieve,
who was also a J.P. of Portsmouth. Every
naval officer always owed a bill to “Gieve’s.”
One day a young sub-lientenant was up for
motor-bike speeding and John was on the
bench. “£2 and costs,” was his verdict. “All
right, put it down in my bill, Mr. Gieve,”
said the irreverent youth. “And £5 for con-
tempt of court,” added his Worship. Then
the conversation languished.
“Nosrac”: “E.L.R.B.’s” par. (B. 9/7/’25)
fairly clamors for some correction. The first
engine that ever ran on rails was built by
Richard Trevithick, a Cornishman, in 1804,
and not by Stephenson. It never managed
to kill anybody, and after crawling a few
miles along the wooden rails of the Wylam
colliery retired permanently from business.
The first individual to lose his life per con-
tact with a loco, was Huskisson, M.P. for
Liverpool; so far from being an unbeliever
in the power of steam, he was one of the pro-
moters of the Liverpool and Manchester rail-
way, and it was at the opening of this his-
toric line on September 12, 1830, that this
accident occurred. The engine was Stephen-
son’s “Rocket”; the unfortunate politician
was taken on the engine to his home, 15
miles away, at the unheard-of speed of 36
m.p.h. It is worth mentioning that Blen-
kinsop’s and Medley’s engines were working-
on the Tees between Stockton and Darling-
ton as early as 1812, 18 years before this.

“Harold Hardupp” : A Melbourne J.P. who
had to pay a fine of 10s. on a “drunk”
charge can reckon himself amongst the luck.v
ones. He was having a heated argument
with a taxi-driver and a strange man who
wanted to get him into the taxi and drive
him home, when a John Hop came along.
The obstreperous person had his pockets
stuffed with money and cheques, and a valu-
able gold watch and chain hanging on his
ample waist, which decided the constable to
impound him for his own good. That same
night, within a distance of 100 yards, three
people were robbed. One, a girl, had a
purse snatched from her with only a silver
watch in it; two men, held up, panned out
only £2 between them. And the prize whom
Providence and the police had lugged out
of the danger zone was snoring his way
back to sobriety in the cells !

“Nikko”: The tale of the hotel mix-up
between the two Jones couples (B. 2/7/’25)
recalls a similar happening-
in Wellington, M.L. A post-
office official who was used
to working until midnight
was one morning advised by
his wife that when he re-
turned that evening tli e
household goods and gods
would be removed to the new
abode, some doors up, and
was handed a key of his new
residence. He arrived in
front of the long terrace of
houses, all exactly alike, just
ifter “midnight, and, remem-
bering that his was still the
ront balcony room, he turned
his_ key and softly stole up-
stairs. A dim gaslight was
burning, and the steady
breathing from the bed con-
vinced him that his wife was
wrapped in well-earned slum-
>m\ if is boots and coat were
off, and he was struggling
with a stud when he heard a
gasp from behind, and turned
to find a strange woman sit-
ting up in bed and preparing
to yell. “Don’t scream, for
God’s sake, don’t,” entreated
the harassed man, “I’ve come
to the wrong house. We
moved to-day.” He seized his
belongings and fled ere the
lady had time to get on to a
really high note. It was
about an hour later, when
his wife came anxiously on
to the balcony to scan the
horizon for him, that he had
the courage to open another
front door.
“Oxmead”: Don’t know about the legality
or otherwise of a marriage service shouted
across a flooded creek, but I have heard of
a magistrate trying offenders at precisely the
same long range. At Geraldton (W.A.) a
tradition still lingers of the days when old
Tom Burges used to ride into town from his
station to perform any court work that was
waiting for him. On one of these trips the
Chapman River, about a mile out of town,
proved to be an impassable torrent, and
Tom reined up. Just as this moment the
sergeant of police appeared on the other
bank, and bellowed that there were six pri-
soners in the lock-up charged with minor
offences. What should he do with them?
“Bring them down here,” yelled the squatter-
beak, “and we’ll hold court in the open.”
And down to the Chapman the Law pre-
sently shepherded an assorted bunch of mis-
demeanants, mostly drunks in the throes of
recovery. The sergeant howled the details
AND OUT THE OTHER SIDE.
“Did you hear I came into a nice little pot of money ?”
“Worse than that, silly. I heard you went right through it!”
of each offender’s lapse across the river, and
an arresting constable contributed stentorian
endorsement, and the culprits—at least, those
whose voices would carry that far —screeched
anything that occurred to them in extenua-
tion, and the J.P. inflated his lungs and bel-
lowed back “Cautioned” or “Fined five shil-
lings” with immense empressement. It may
have been illegal, but I never heard of any
appeals being lodged.
* * *• *•
“Machete”: I have been in close contact
with the haute noiblesse. I inhabit that part
of Darlinghurst where social standing is
estimated not by the number of heraldic
quarterings you can show, but by the num-
ber of storeys contained in the flat where you
have your being. Naturally, a person like
myself, who exists in a dwelling of two paltry
storeys, is soon taught to know his station
and keep in it. So the other evening, when
in the process of acquiring my bottle of beer,
at an emporium patronised by duchesses of
the highest standing, I hastily moved down
the counter to make room for such a one
who swept in. Demanding in queenly accents
a bottle of Manhattan cocktail, she negli-
gently leant one elbow of her fur coat on the
counter. Unhappily, in my agitation I had
left there an inadequately wrapped bundle
of hot “chips,” a plebeian delicacy to which
I am greatly addicted. The pleasant warmth
attracted her notice, and lifting her elbow
she investigated the somewhat greasy bundle
and then the sleeve of her coat. By the
mercy of Heaven, my bottle arrived just
then, and seizing the odoriferous parcel I
fled into the winter’s night before the power
of speech could return to Madame la Mar-
quise.

“Forebridge”: The present skipper of the
Anchises isn’t the only man who saw the
historic old Cutty Sark during the war,
“dirty and unkempt but making profits for
Portuguese owners” (B. 9/7/’25). I was a
young sub. on H.M.S. Cornwall, which put
into Cape Town in February, 1917. Strolling
round the docks one morning with a ship-
mate —an old “hardcase” R.N.R. lieutenant
—I suddenly came on a decrepit-looking
sailing-ship flying the Portuguese flag. My
companion stopped for a moment as if spell-
bound, and then, without a word, scrambled
on board. I followed. Not a soul was to
be seen. The vessel’s masts had been cut
down, her gear was rotten, her decks were
slime-encrusted; she was filthy beyond be-
lief, and a small farmyard defiled the poop.
My friend, usually a talkative man, said
never a word, and I was puzzled at his
queer looks, for to me the old vessel was just
a dirty and forlorn hulk, albeit with pre-
possessing lines. When we stumbled back
on to the jetty I asked him some trivial
question. I don’t think he heard it, and
when I glanced at his face I saw, to my
amazement, that there were tears running
down it. You will know already that the
ship was the Cutty Sark; but what I didn’t
find out till months later was that my old
Irish friend had once been her chief mate.
* * * *
“Walter Lichen”: More often than not
jury-squaring is done without a penny chang-
ing hands. Suppose you live in Fitzroy or
Collingwood, or some inner suburb, and are
on a jury which
brings in a “guilty”
verdict against one
of the lads, you’ll
see wh a t yo.u’ll
get. One man, a
decent, hardwork-
ing little chap,
helped to find
Murphy, a dweller
in the same neigh-
borhood, guilty of a
cri me. Reprisals
began with stones
on the roof, then
three of his win-
dows were broken
in one night. A
little later his wash-
house was set on
fire. Then his boys
began to catch it
from other boys till
they were scared to
go out in the
streets. Little girls
put their tongues
out at his little girl
and said her father
was a “scab.” In
the boot - factory,
where he had
worked for nearly
20 years, kerosene
was poured into
his lunch-bag. In
the end he had to
sell his house and
clear out. That sort
of thing gets abput
and makes me n
careful about bring-
ing in a verdict of
guilty. It’ll go on
till a majority ver-
dict convicts, s o
that the pushes can’t fix on any particlar
juryman.

“S.T.S.”: S.A, antiquarians have been
going into the history of the unauthorised
sovereigns which that State once made, and
of which a few are still to be found. It
was late in 1852, when nearly all the male
population had gone across to Bendigo and
Ballarat, and was sending home its findings
in the shape of nuggets and dust. Adelaide
was stuck for want of currency, and Gover-
nor Young authorised a new coinage at th<•
Adelaide Mint. A few thousands had been
PRE-SELECTION.

struck off before the English Government
heard of it six months later and forbade
the carrying on of the experiment. The
sovereign is stamped “Government Assay
Office, 1852: weight sdwt. 15grs. 22 carats:
value one pound.”

SO THIS IS MELBOURNE?
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
“Were the Lord Mayor to call a meeting of all
those citizens of Melbourne and suburbs whose homes
and business premises have been despoiled by robbers
during the last few years he would require to hire
the Exhibition Building to accommodate them. The
burglar and the gunman, the shopbreaker and the
footpad are having what is colloquially described as
the time of their lives. Root-and-branch reorganisa-
tion of the police force is imperatively demanded.”
—Arqus (7/7/’25.)
Know' ye the town where the mask and the sandbag
Are emblems of things that are done in the street?
Where nightly the snatcher of wallet or handbag
Escapes with a laugh at the cop on his beat?
Where no building is safe from the jemmy of Sikes,
And Flash Toby Orackit does much as he likes?
Know ye the suburbs with corners in shadow
Where the beetle-browed thug lies in wait for his
prey?
Where the gunman emerges from fell ambuscado
To carry your portable assets away,
Or, mayhap, you are “frisked” for your uttermost bob
With a bit of lead piping held over your nob ?
Ivnow ye the warrens and slums — if you’re vague in
Your sense of direction the Argus may tell—
Where, if you’d luck, you might come on a Fagin
Schooling his charges in crime to excel?
Know ye the spheres where the larrikins clash,
Ferocious and foul as Parisian Apaches ?
Know ye the State where less honor bestowed is
On uniformed Johns than in vaudeville sketch?
Where they sneer Quis custodiet ipsos custodes
When a bunch of detectives goes up for a stretch?
Where a phrase like “The Force” its repute would
convey
More clear if the “o” were replaced with an “a” ?

“Sucre” : I know a worse case than that
of the voter who dropped his spectacles into
the ballot-box (B. 9/7/’25). It happened
at Merindi (N.Q.) some years ago when
I was returning-officer for the Herbert divir
sion at the Federal elections. An aged
exerciser of the franchise was taken with a
fit of coughing while in the act of posting
his ballot-paper. The vibratiou shook out liis
top row of false teeth and they rattled into
the orifice after his vote. As the box was
taken to Darwin, four miles distant, before
it was opened, the hapless ancient had to
gum his food until the following Monday.

“Ming” : Talking of fortune-tellers, a young
friend of mine who once consulted a back-
street oracle retains her faith. It happened
to be the period when futurists were being
harassed by the unsympathetic police, and
Louisa, whose father is a church elder, felt
she was doing a sporty thing. The seeress
hadn’t had time to tell her much when
someone dashed aside the curtain and said
hoarsely, “Police! Run quick!” Louisa,
obeying directions, dashed across a small
yard, visualising as she went the wrath
of her father and the church if she couldn’t
get clear. There was a low wall at the back
and over this she clambered gallantly, de-
scending through the roof of a small fowl-
house amidst a pandemonium of cackle.
Before Louisa co”ld extricate herself the
owners arrived. “We’ve gottim,” said a deep
voice, “when I open the door you ’old ’iin.”
As Louisa crept out, “Gosh! It’s a girl,”
said the astounded poultry fancier. “ ’Ow
long ’ave you bin at this game? An’ where’s
my 17 Buff Horpingtons?” Louisa protested
hysterically, but dad sent for the local con-
stable, and it was only by making a clean
breast of it that she was exonerated and
escaped any further publicity. Of course
it was a false alarm that started the flight,
but Louisa still insists that the seeress was
really good—had just prophesied a time of
great excitement for her client, and it came
hot on the prediction.
AT TWO IN THE MORNING.
VISITOR FROM INDIA : “And do you know it is the custom of men
in India to remove their shoes before entering the house ?”
HOSTESS : “ That's nothing out of the way. My husband has done
it for years.'”
“Percy Pawnticket”: To write a letter to
some fictitious lover, and drop it carelessly
somewhere about the house, is the way
adopted by some women to revive the fires of
conjugal affection. But there are some
obvious dangers attached to the method. A
Melbourne lady who had tried it, and found
that after a partial restoration of the old
fealty her husband was drifting again,
thought she would experiment with a new
idea, and stayed away from home at night.
Then her husband remembered the letter
addressed to Tom Jones he had found some
months before, and after brooding over the
matter for a day or two he seized his hat
and raced,for the Malvern address that the
envelope had borne, only to find that there
was a Tom Jones there. That he was the
father of many children only made his appa-
rent enormity the worse; and the news that
he had left home that afternoon on business
in a country town fanned the flame of sus-
picion. The conflagration spread to the
bosom of Mrs. Jones after she had heard the
HE HAD A USE FOR ONE.
JESSIE : “ 'Jer like to have a little sister, Tom[?]
TOMMIE: “Yurnmie, yairs! I"m fed up with teasin' the cat. ”
bereaved husband's story; she promptly
started for the country town where Jones
was pursuing his commercial activities, and,
encountering her husband talking business
to a woman in the street, without waiting
for any explanation she attacked the presum-
able she-vamp with a dogwhip. Meanwhile
the lady who had started the rumpus was
ringing up from the house of the friends
with whom she had stayed to tell the dejected
husband where he could find her. Her ex-
planations had just been accepted when the
rift in the lute was widened again by. the
arrival of an indignant Jones —full of the
righteous anger of one who felt that he had
lost one of his best customers through the
mix-up, and ethically couldn’t expend his
wrath on his wife—with his wife’s dogwhip
to exact retribution. Jones made such a
good job of it that the Bench (even after
hearing the circumstances) assessed the price
of the retribution at £5 and costs.
* * * *
“Flicker” : The discussion on the duties and
qualifications of public executioners might be
rounded off with a word about the emolu-
merits of the job.
When Calcraft was
appointed “hang-
man to the City of
London”—an office
that disappeared
when he resigned it
in 1874 —his wages
were fl 10s. per
week, with an
extra guinea for
each execution. A
flogging only
brought the opera-
tor half a crown,
but he was allowed
to perform country
jobs, for which he
received £lO a neck.
The oath taken by
London’s city hang-
man must have
been a grisly cere-
mony. The appoin-
tee was compelled
to swear on the
Bible that he would
despatch all crim-
inals “without fear
or favor, whether
they be father,
mother, relation or
friend” ; finally he
was dismissed with
the genial benediction of “Get thee gone,
wretch!”

“Merris” with a bedroom play:—
Apropos of bolting- brides (B. 2/7/’25), I know of
one who left her run until they were right ur the
straight, so to speak, and past the judge’s box. They
were married in the early morning; and the red
glow of sunset found them comfortably housed in a
c-ity hotel. Hand in hand from the balcony they
watched the eager throng on its way to the picture
shows. About 10 o’clock Mabel felt sleepy, and
George, with tender gallantry, announced his inten-
tion of smoking one more cigarette before turning-
in. It was apparently on her way upstairs that
Mabel's heart failed her; suddenly she thought of
her kindly old aunt who lived in a distant suburb,
and without waiting to put on a hat she dashed
down .the stairs and boarded a passing tram.
George threw his glowing cigarette butt into the
roadway, strolled up the broad corridor, softly
opened the bedroom door and switched on the light.
His first impulse was to raise the alarm, but he re-
membered Mabel’s timorous nature and her aunt’s
address, so without waiting to put on a hat he
dashed down the stairs and boarded a passing tram.
When Mabel reached the residence of her aunt and
found it all in darkness, fear of ridicule overcame
her; without knocking she crept silently away and
signalled a city-bound car. Timorously she crept
up the stairs and switched on the light. A great
sigh of relief escaped her.
When George reached the darkened residence of the
aunt he paused irresolutely; clearly she wasn’t there
or the place would have been flooded with light and
agitation. Fear of ridicule overcame him; he crept
away undetected and signalled a city-bound car.
Panic gripped him by the throat, and for hours he
walked aimlessly under the cruel stars; at length
haggard and exhausted he crept silently up the
stairs, opened the bedrqom door and switched on the
light. A great sigh of relief escaped him.

“Bilbie” : Re Boulder City (B. 11/6/’25),
I think the late J. M. Hopkins (subsequently
a State Minister) and not “Smiler” Hales was
responsible for the grandiose nomenclature.
And it isn’t quite the only “City” in Aus-
tralia ; there is another, not so many miles
away, that has fared much worse. When the
Hampton Plains mining boom was at its
height a few years ago, a site for a town was
duly surveyed and laid out by the Govern-
ment on the chance of a second Golden
Mile eventuating. The area was duly
gazetted by the Lands and Mines Depart-
ments as “Celebration City,” and still wears
that name, although it consists of nothing
more than a solitary pub and a few iron
shanties.

“H.1.M.”; Allusions to the “Fighting
First” (or Fifth, Fifteenth or Fifty-anv-
thingtfy) remind me of some other A.I.F.
titles. The First Battery was composed of
regulars; their attitude of superiority in
the early training days gained them the
ironic sobriquet of “The Soldiers.” Later
on, at Gallipoli, a battery which was always
going somewhere and being recalled was
christened “The Deep Sea Battery.” Allit-
eration may have had something to do with
the nom-de-guerre of “The Thieving Third,”
but their nocturnal activities in the firewood
line were marked. To pinch timber from
the beach would have been too commonplace,
but it was a long way from the beach to
Russell’s Top, so a variant w r as introduced.
At 1 g.m., say. H.Q. would be noted climb-
ing the hill from Reserve Gully with timber.
At 3 g.m. details would sally from Russell’s
Top and steal the already stolen, burying it
in a parapet until wanted. Peevish matu-
tinal callers never found anything but the
weather to discuss with us.

“Bill Bowyang”: “Bluey” Breen was one
of a camel party 'who left Mersa Matruh to
patrol the silent wastes of the Libyan Desert.
Near an oasis he found a dead Senussi war-
rior with 50 sovereigns in the greenhide belt
around his waist. Bluey’s mates were chas-
ing quail among the stunted shrubbery on
the outskirts of the oasis, and he decided not
to mention the incident as he concealed the
coins in his tunic. On the way back to Mersa
Matruh the rattle of those sovereigns con-
jured up glorious visions of an early leave
trip to Cairo, countless glasses of Pyramid
beer and some lazy basking in the cushioned
dwellings of the henna-dyed maids of the
Wazza. Back in camp, lie placed the sov-
ereigns in an empty pickle bottle, and, digging
a hole in the sand beside the pole inside his
tent, carefully buried his treasure. Ten min-
utes later Bluey was picked to accompany
another patrol into the interior, and in the
hurry of departure forgot all about the cache.
When he returned two days later he found
that his tent, with others, had been shifted
a quarter of a mile; the spot where he had
concealed the sovereigns was now a vast
stretch of sand. During the remainder of
our stay at Mersa Matruh Bluey spent all
his spare time in fruitless prospecting. A
few days back I met him toiling in a N.Q.
cane paddock; he told me that often in
dreams he goes back to the desert and
searches for the elusive treasure.
* * * *
“Harora”: A marked feature of the recent
Santa Barbara (California) earthquake was
the small loss of life compared with damage
to property. It was the same in the big
’Frisco shake-up in April, 1906, a point on
which I can speak with certainty, for I
covered some of the worst affected areas of
the city between the big ’quake and the
sweeping of the ruins by lire. On that
occasion the first shock lasted 68 seconds.
There were a dozen more during the day,
and 33 within three days. A month after
the destruction of the city I had warning
of an earth tremor by ’phone. I was speak-
ing from Berkeley, on the north shore of

stopped. A few seconds later I heard my
friend apologising; an earthquake was on
at Alameda, and he had rushed from the
instrument to save a wavering lamp. Hardly
had he spoken when the house I was in
creaked as though a giant had leaned, against
it. The heave travelled eight miles in about
as many seconds.

“C.”: The last tangible evidence of the
convict days of Wollongong (N.S.W.) is
being removed with the demolition of the old
hospital, for some years past used as the
nurses’ quarters. Originally a grant made
in 1831 to Thomas Osborne, Hospital Hill
has been subdivided and built on down the
years; the original residence of the owner,
with several acres surrounding it, eventually
became the old hospital. Underneath are
several cellars where convict servants were
housed; and the curious- visitor has always
been able to locate the solitary confinement
cells, with only a peephole for ventilation,
and outside them the whipping-posts. Now
the grisly relics are doomed.

“Herodot” : An event like the forthcoming
visit of the U.S. Fleet to Sydney and Mel-

round up suspicious characters of both sexes
who might interfere with the comfort of the
expected guests. The arrival of some thou-
sands of visitors, each well provided with cash,
is naturally an occasion full of interest for
the underworld; but just at present large
numbers of Sydney’s least desirable citizens
are lying extremely low, or are engaged in
something sufficiently resembling work to put
them, temporarily out of the reach of a
vagrancy charge. Others have left the city,
to return quietly later on. Still, despite all
the police can do, one may expect to hear
of a few free-hearted Jackies being separated
from their cash.

quality of those reserves. They consist of: —
Reserve for depreciation .. £66,428

And this paper has doubts whether the first
and the third are genuine reserves ; that is
to say, whether there is 20s. in the £ of
capital and that much over. From the fact
that the directors have now written ss.
in the £ off capital, it looks as though they
have their doubts, too. The good things have
come in patches. Before that table; opens
there were a couple of dry spells and the
20 p.c. div. of 1918 was the first plum to be
picked for many years. Two years later
came a two-in-five gift issue, and this, with
the big divs. of the boom years, wiped out
the memory of the earlier famines. Mean-
time capital had grown: before the capi-
talisation it was £130,000: on March
31 last it was £294,698. But the past
few years, so far as the timber trade is
concerned, have been very bitter. There has
been increasing competition among local mer-
chants —wholesalers, retailers and joinery
merchants —and the prices of imported timbers
have suffered drastic cuts, so that local cos.
have had to use the axe to bring book values
down to replacement costs. In addition to
price wars, there has been a» growing de-
mand for substitutes, and less demand for
hardwood. These have affected all timber
cos. But McKenzie, Ltd., has had a bunch
of private troubles. In 1920 it purchased
10,000 acres of forest on Fraser Island, near
Maryborough (Q.), from H. McKenzie. The
report put the latest development this way:
Fraser Island, which is the principal asset of H.
McKenzie (Q.), Ltd., and appears on our balance-
sheet in “shares in other cos.,” has not realised
expectations. Owing to the limitations of the lease,
drastic depreciations of approximately Ilf p.c. p.a.
have had to be made; this necessity, together with
the high cost of production, has caused a deficit each
year on this venture, and is an additional drag on
the resources of our co. Provision for the deficit
each year has been made by way of reserves, but
owing to the loss sustained during the past year,
this cannot be maintained on this occasion. Efforts
are being made to dispose of this property, or alter-
natively to cultivate a Queensland trade which may
help to make the mill investment self-supporting.
All tilings considered, it looks very much now
as if the profits of 1922-23-24 were not
earned; that instead of meeting fallen
values with a drastic revision of stock
figures, the co. used the pencil too
lightly. However, the Board realised
that the position had to be met, and it de-
cided to write off ss. per share. Nominal
capital is therefore now £300,000 in 400,000
shares of 15s. each, paid capital being reduced
from £294,698 to £221,024. The book value
of “shares in other cos..” which covers the
Fraser Island show, is written down by
£70.000.
The position as at March 31, compared
with the previous year, is like this: —
1924. 1925.

Stocks 175,023 97,767
Stocks have been written down to “replace-
ment costs,” according to the report. The
co. obtained possession of, the N.S.W. State
timber yard a year ago. but this property
has not yet been utilised, the idea apparently
being to sell part or all of it. The position
from the outsider’s noint of view is quite
sound; liabilities on March 31 totalled
£14,667, while cash in hand and at short call
was equal to almost double that. Various
economies have been lately made; neverthe-
less the position of the trade is so unsatis-
factory that prospects for the current term
are by no means bright.

Shareholders got their usual 10 p.c., but
according to the accounts’it was not earned.
There is a reserve fund of £43,000, consist-
ing of fixed deposits, Commonwealth stock,
City Council debentures and shares in public
cos. Ordinarily some or most of the earn-
ings from those investments arc credited
direct to the fund (they are included in
profits in the introductory table) ; for
example, £2500 in 1922, £2OOO in 1923 and
£lOOO in 1924. But nothing was so credited
last year. The Board may have decided that
the fund affords sufficient reserve, but it
is much more likely that the figures reflect
the increasing difficulty experienced by
timber merchants in the past few years.
Most other concerns have had a hard time,
and severe losses have been the common ex-
perience. However, the price-war in im-
ported softwoods, which has been raging in-
termittently for over two years, and the
drastic cuts in the overseas producing centres
affected Taylor’s but little. Unlike most
merchants, they did not carry heavy stocks,
and were not faced with the necessity of
ruthless writing-down. But the growth in
concrete construction and the slackening in
heavy timber work by Government depart-
ments have inevitably been reflected in less-
ened turnover and lessened profits. And it
is in heavy timbers that. Taylor’s mostly
operates. The financial stringency played its
part, of course. Last year the co. gave more
attention to export with success that assisted
to offset the dulness in home business. There
is no statement of the provision for depre-
ciation. In previous years there were indi-
cations that liberal allowance had been made,
and although the directors report that the
necessary depreciation of the wasting assets
has been provided, it is unlikely that it was
on the same scale. Nevertheless the finan-
cial position is very sound, as this compari-
son of balance-sheet figures shows :
1914. 1923. 1924. 1925.

Each of the 150,000 £1 fully-paid shares is
represented by assets with a book value of
265. 3d. The directors report these assets in
good condition. carefully valued and
adequately insured.
Although the scrip has yielded an average
10 p.c. since the co.’s formation, it must
not be forgotten that the cost of living has
gone up no less to the investor than to the
worker, and that some of the capital was
issued at a premium. Therefore the 10 p.c.
of recent years has not been worth as much
as it was 10 years ago. But the co. has
consolidated its position, and shareholders
have the security that is contained in £47,324
of reserves, £43,000 of which is invested out-
side the business. The report is silent as
to prospects. Past construction booms based
on State borrowings have proved profitable
to handlers of big timber, but a recurrence
of the hectic loan-mongering of earlier years
seems improbable. Likelihood of material
improvement during the current term is
slight. Taylor’s will continue to get its
share of the business, and shareholders will
almost certainly get divs., but unless trading
conditions change for the better the 10 p.c.
does not look secure.

With average funds of £30,376 at work dur-
ing the year that profit is very small, and
the div. is less than 5 p.c. on shareholders’
funds. Interest and rent brought in £2279,
so net earnings from trustee operations pro-
vided only £474. Trusts are in excess of
three millions, so the return is very poor:
for the State Trust Office of N.Z. is a
powerful competitor, and keeps rates at
razor-edge margins. The latest 15 p.c. div.
is the twentieth of its line, and in that period
£11,600 has been added to reserves—the paid
capital is only £lO,OOO. If the Board issued
bonus scrip to the extent of, say, the present
paid-up capital, the div. would assume an
appearance more in keeping with the rather
drab realities of the case.

In 1911 the co. controlled the picture inter-
ests of the Taits. Chafing at the keenness of
foreign film producers, who seized advantage
of the competition to charge all that the
traffic would bear, Amalgamated talked
things over with its chief rivals, Spencer’s
and West’s; and the General Film Co. of
Australasia was the result. Later when
Barrington Miller was placed in control of
J. D. Williams, that firm entered the circle.
The final development was Union Theatres,
Ltd., and Australasian Films, Ltd., the
former to show the pictures, the latter to
do the hiring. For their goodwill the sub-
sidiary cos. were given loads of shares, which
accounts for the writing up stated in the
opening lines. But this co. has more than
hot air in its assets: —

It owns the St. Kilda theatre, a freehold
which has been written down (by £2OOO or
so) to £6565; the Melbourne Majestic, a
leasehold on which the co. has spent over
£34,000; interests in Melbourne suburban
theatres; and £11,700 of debentures, repre-
senting loan to General Film Co. Union
Theatres runs the Majestic and Amalgamated
collects the rent. Here is a record of earn-
ings and exes: —

A rise of £BOO in expenses looks serious, but
the whole' of it was provision for taxation.
The return from the combine cos. is very
small; allowing that the debentures bear
interest at 5 p.c., the yield was little more
than £3OOO -on £87,616 of shares plus £4OOO
in subsidiaries, or something like 3i p.c.
Fortunately Amalgamated did not inflate its
own capital to conform with the writing-up
of its assets. Instead, it pursued the much
sounder course of wiping out a deficit and
placing the balance, £59.663, into a capital
realisation reserve “to provide for any fluctu-
ation in the value of shares held.” The con-
sequence is that shareholders have had a
regular run of divs. —mostly 10 p.c. since
1915, with 5 p.c. on four occasions. Tan-
gibles consist of freeholds and leaseholds,
book debts, cash and securities (£57,125),
which, after liabilities and divs. had been
attended to, was equal to £4 7s. 4d. for each
£1 of pref. capital. Then there was what-
ever was solid behind the £103,316 interest
in the combine cos. and the subsidiaries.

For the past two years the directors have
pleaded the weather as an excuse for poor
results. Last summer certainly was unkind
in patches, but the sundae scoffers seemed
to be abroad in the land in undiminished
numbers. The real cause of the trouble
appears to have been poor management
shown in the uneconomic production of the
poods retailed in the co.’s shops. Changes
have lately been made, and instead of scat-
tered production, work is concentrated in a
modern factory. Alterations are being made
also at the chief city cafe, from which the
management expects good results. The
public is interested only in the prefs.: £14,130
carrying 10 p.c. To represent them on
February 28, after liabilities of £2022 had
been provided for, there was £1989 of cash,
a freehold valued at £37,391 less mortgage
of £l5 000, stocks £4252, and book debts
£372, the lot equal to £2 4s. Id. per pref.
share, with leasehold, plant and fittings
worth (book value) a further 16s. Bd. per
share. The amounts written off appear to
be substantial, and the plant generally is
reported to be in good condition. The
balance of P. and L. had to be drawn on
to pay last year’s div.; the amount now
stands at £1291. The management reports
that improvement in results is visible since
the close of the accounts. It will need to
continue, for there arc 55,017 £1 ordinary
shares waiting for a taste. Meantime the
interests of pref. holders are sufficiently pro-
tected.

Sydney has eaten this co. out of its troubles :

Excess liabilities.. £3,528 £B6O
Liquid surplus . . £3,356 £8,258
Of course, that doesn’t necessarily mean that
the co. is £11,786 better off than it was
only two years ago. There may be fewer
cups and saucers and things now, for in-
stance ; and there is nearly always some taxa-
tion to be paid soon after March 31, and the
co. would certainly owe more this year than
it did in 1923. Also, ordinaries haven’t had
a bite since 1919 until now. Still, the re-
covery, though it is thus not quite all it
looks, has been good, and is a credit to the
people who took the business in hand after
it had been just about wrecked. Freehold
and plant and fittings are in the books at
£34,780, but against that there is a “reserve
for depreciation, etc.,” £9096. The “etc.”
is apparently taxation; and the two should
be kept separate. That very doubtful re-
serve is not reckoned with the reserves in
the first table. Unless the depreciation re-
serve is utterly inadequate to counter-
balance wear and tear and breakages and
thefts, the written-down capital is now in-
tact; and if the co. can make even three-
quarters of the average profit of the. past
three years the ordinaries wall get their 10
p.c. ali right.

Australian Prest Air, Ltd., is a syndi-
cate co. formed to acquire from Eric W.
Richards the Australian rights of a patent
for the manufacture of liquid carbon dioxide
and carbon dioxide-ice, and to promote cos.
in the several Australian States to carry on
manufacture and sale. Capital is £lOO 000
in £lOO shares; 500 are to be issued for the
transfer of tb e rights and the other 500 are
offered at £25 per share on application, the
balance on allotment. Numerous advantages
are claimed for this refrigerating substance.
On exposure liquid carbon dioxide immedi-
ately returns to a vapor. Solidified carbon
dioxide (Prest-Air Ice), however, evaporates
slowly and is said to last frotn five to. ten
times' as long as water ice. Further, it is
considerably colder: it has a temperature of
114° below zero. Approximately £27,200 is
to be paid for the rights. This will leave
about £22,000 for the promotion of operating
cos., and the idea is to get this back from
them. It is suggested that a share considera-
tion of £30,000 and cash of £5OOO be secured
by the parent for every 25-ton plant installed.
The capacity of the mainland States is
placed at 13 "plants; but the prospectus takes
as a basis the establishment of 10 plants
and thereupon wallows in wealth. Reports

Monolyte Constructions (Vic. and S.A.),
Ltd., is being formed to acquire a patented
process for the construction of rein-
forced cement-concrete houses and to operate
it. The process has been long used by the
inventor, S. B. Marchant, who is a builder,
and there are plenty of examples of its suc-
cess in S. Aus. and Vic. Nominal capital is
£200,000 in shares of £1 each, of which
91,000 are offered, ss. on application, ss. (or
less) on allotment, but shares are not to be
called beyond 10s. until six months after
registration; 20,000 go to S. B. Marchant
and A. T. Teasdale with £lOOO in cash each
to A. T. Teasdale and B. A. Marchant. Ven-
dors’ shares, although issued as fully-paid,
will rank with the contribs. in the distribu-
tion of divs. only on the basis of the paid-up
value of the contribs. Of the vendors’ shares
10,000 are to be issued upon incorporation,
5000 when 50000 contribs. have been applied
for, and 5000 when 75,000 shares have been
applied for; 9000 fully-paids are to be issued
to the brokers and others as underwriting
commission. In addition brokerage of 5 p.c.
will be paid and an over-riding brokerage of
21 p.c. to B. W. Reuseh and Co., part con-
sideration for services rendered. Eulogies of
the process are quoted from Government and
Savings Bank officials and architects, and
the 24-page prospectus is profusely illus-
trated with “Monolyte” houses. Chas. H. Sum-
mers, A.R.V.1.A., estimates a net profit of
10 p.c. on contract price, and a further esti-
mate reckons on enough profit to pay 15 p.c.
divs. Those figures, however, carry no con-
firmation by an independent authority. The.
loading (vendors’ shares, cash payments and
shares for brokers) amounts to a heavy 31
p.c.; and the preliminary expenses will not
be light. The method itself seems something
more than merely satisfactory.

Kalgoorlie is. booming a new gold find in
country 10 miles south of Kurnalpi, which,
it is alleged, has never previously been pros-
pected. Stone napped from a “huge quartz
blow” is said to be rich, and rock broken
from other outcrops is reckoned to be quite
as good. Kurnalpi used to be one of the
biggest alluvial fields in the West, and many
who were acquainted with the early days of
Coolgardie and Kalgoorlie declare that Kur-
nalpi beat them both in the matter of wealth.
The reefs there, however, were poor.
Westralia's gold-production still declines.
For the six months ended June the decrease
was nearly 40,0000 z. compared with the first
half of 1924, and the depressing feature is
that the bulk of the output continues to
come from the few remaining mines at Kal-
goorlie. The search for new shows is pro-
ceeding, but. with little success. Apart from
Kalgoorlie and contributions from two or
three of the smaller centres such as Meeka-
tharra. Gwalia and Yilgarn. Westralia’s
gold yield nowadays is insignificant
* * * *
At Gnow's Nest (W.A.) the Brilliant Co.
has struck a sea of troubles in more senses
than one. In sinking the main shaft from
280 ft. to 380 ft. level it has had to contend
against, an inflow' of water estimated at
250,000 gallons per day. Calls have been so
frequent that shareholders are now as slow
to pay them as the Mines Department is to
make further cash advances on loan. To
date £lO,OOO has been expended in an en-
deavor to strike the reef at the 380 ft. level,
and the main crosscut has yet to be extended
from the shaft to where the reef is hoped to
be. If the reef comes up to the expectations
of the optimists, about £20,000 worth of
gold may be available between the 280 ft. and
380 ft. levels. This w-ill cost £lO,OOO to win.
and as developmental charges already amount
to £lO,OOO, the co. may have a bare chance of
getting some of its good money back.
Notwithstanding general good management
and competent underground surveying, it is
just possible the Bullfinch Proprietary
(W.A.) has missed something important.
Prospector Ewan Macdonald, working a por-
tion of the co.’s surrendered areas, has located
near the surface a lode formation 15ft. wide
from wdiich he has obtained 220 tons yielding
190 oz. gold, and the Ibde appeals to b 3 going
underfoot Sti-ongly. Lxperts Say Macdonald’s
find is simply the cap of one Of the numerotis
lodes worked by the Bullfinch Proprietary
from the mine levels Underneath. In reply
Macdonald says he intends sinking On the
find, and in doing so will not b'e afraid Of
holing through to old Bullfinch workings.
Perth is being asked to find capital to
work the immense manganese ore-deposits
in the Peak Hill district (W.A.). Estimates
of visible tonnage vouched for by State
Mining-Engineer Montgomery and other _ ex-
perts range from over a million to millions
of tons, and after allowing for all expendi-
ture a net profit of 255. or more is reckoned
on. Montgomery, whose estimates are invari-
ably conservative, says that the gross value
of the ore in sight is £13,000,000. A limited
liability co. in 250,000 £1 shares is being
formed, and 125,000 10 per cent. £1 deben-
tures are to be issued, the vendor annexing
two-fifths of the issued shares and debentures
as purchase consideration. To help along
the flotation the provisional directors, who
include Hedges, ex-M.11.R., and MacCallum
Smith, M.L.A., have promised to subscribe
about £15,000, and the Broken Hill Prop,
has agreed to subscribe for £lO,OOO worth of
debentures and take 5000 tons of ore a year.

Two companies to prospect for minerals
in Central Australia are being formed in
Adelaide. The directors of the Mid-Australian
Exploration Co. are Edward Lucas, sometime
S. Aus. Agent-General; James H. Gosse, and
Alfred le Messurier, the coastal shipping
man; the capital is £lO,OOO in £lO shares,
150 going to the promoters, who will pay
flotation expenses. William Garnett and
John Ansell, old prospectors in Queensland
and Central Australia, are in charge of the
search parties. Garnett found the Ruby
Vale gem field in Central Queensland, and
more recently the Home of Bullion silver-
lead mine at Barrow Creek. The other
venture is the North Australian Development,
Ltd., the capital being £lO,OOO in £lO shares
• —460 fully-paids go to the promoters and
syndicators, 240 are offered to the public, and
300 are in reserve. This co. holds eight claims
—two gold, one silver-lead, three asbestos,
one mica and one tin.

Chillagoe Smelters (N.Q.) have closed
down owing to shortage of ore. Chief sup-
plies have been coming from the State-owned
Lady Jane and Girofla supplemented by
sundry small tonnages from surrounding
mining districts. Development on the Night
flower has been too slow end awinr
up to expectations, and P. L. Goddard had
been looking forward to smelter feeu irom uns
mine. Lawn Hills has supplied very little
ore, chiefly owing to transit difficulties. There
is an uneasy feeling that several members of
Cabinet are not enthusiastic about keeping
Chillagoe running at a loss, and results of
this year's operations at the Smelters are
likely to be crucial. If the Lady Jane
develops further good ore in the near future,
things will be much smoother for the G. M.
at Chillagoe, for its rich ore is what the
smelters chiefly rely on, Girofla ore being
rather lean. The official announcement of
closure states that it is only temporary, and
probably a lead and copper furnace will
be. blown in again in a couple of months’
time, but for how long will depend on an
improvement in suitable ore supplies.
The Great Northern Tin at Herberton
(N.Q.) is looking better than for years past.
The last crushing of 156 tons gave
the fine figures of 27.4 tons of concentrates,
which realised £4448, equal to about £2B
per ton. This is probably the richest crush-
ing for its size for some years in the north-
ern field.
* * * *
Mt. Isa scrip has been depressed to the
lowest point since the co. was formed. Yet
development work, which is proceeding
quietly, has revealed nothing to weaken the
impression that the mines will become im-
portant producers of lead and zinc. The
decline in share values is partly due to the
delay in announcing the decision to build
the railway from Duchess. It is realised
on all side that the mines must have a rail-
way to pay. Proprietary scrip is much more
buoyant, yet its chief suit is the same Black
Btar lode of which the Isa holds a largely
preponderant area. Prop. No. 2 bore is
approaching a depth of 550 ft. Although
assay values have not been given out, it is
fairly well known that they will be quite as
good as in No. 1, and that they will show
consistently high zinc values.
* * * *
The Queensland Government lias lost a
heap of money in one of its State collieries,
Mt. Mulligan, but the Mines Minister an-
nounced recently that for the first time in
its career the pit has become payable. Feeble
credit balances have been produced for the
last two months. Jones also states that
prospects of coal reserves are now 7 much
more favorable, and that after an exhaustive
examination the geologist’s recommendations
for future development work are now being
carried out, with good results. However, the
Minister must not make too much of his
credit balances, or the miners may think up
some new demands. Their attitude appears
to be that no profits must be made out of
State mines.

Peak Mines, Cobar (N.S.W.), have
despatched 16 tons shipping ore from the
winze at 226 ft. level, Late reports from the
tvinze (88ft. heldw the rails) are unsatisfac-
tory. The lode has gone flat with the slide,
and, while width has tapered to 12in., silver
values have almost gone out, reading only
7Joz. The gold content remains about 12dwt.

Shareholders paying the 3d. call in Vege-
table Creek, Ardlethan (N.S.W.), have been
bucked up a little by concurrent
ments below, and share values have been
lifted from 6d. to about Is. 6d. The foot-
wall on the western pipe developed porphyry
carrying 1 p.c. tin. In Smith’s workings
No. 2 pipe, dipping again, is very small but
carries 8 p.c. values: and No. 4 pipe is also
narrow but good. In the open cut the ore
is still desci’ibed as poor grade.

Zinc Corporation, Ltd., reports that its
diamond drill No. 58, being put out west
from the main north drive on No. 10 level
at 500 ft. north, has disclosed a body of ore
of approximately 70ft. having an average
grade of 13.3 p.c. lead, 9.10 z. silver and 16
p.c. zinc for the first 57ft. bored.

Ratrut Basin (Siam) is in a better posi-
tion than at any time since 1921, and threat-
ens to resume dividend payments almost im-
mediately. The date will be fixed as soon
as the Siamese Tin Syndicate has signed,
sealed and delivered the necessary papers
confirming the purchase contract over the
new area. Chairman Kerry gave the annual
meeting an account of his recent trip to
the co.’s property and the re-acquisition of
the area of ground which had been purchased
from the Siamese Tin Syndicate and subse-
quently rejected:—
While much of this ground was unpayable, a con-
siderable section could be economically handled at
present tin prices. As the result of negotiations, the
leases were again taken over at a purchase price of
£4OOO. By selecting the part averaging lOoz. and
working through to an adjoining block; belonging to
the co., which contains rather better values, a life
of at least eight years is assured for the dredge.
That’s that, but it must not be forgotten that
on the previous occasion the purchase price
was 30,000 20s. shares in Ratrut, compared
with £4OOO cash now: and that, on check-
ing the Siamese Syndicate’s boring figures,
the Ratrut people rejected the area with
contumely.

Thabawleik (Burma) has had the last
of its dredge material transported to the
head of navigation on the Tenasserim River,
and most of it is at the site where the dredge
will operate. Pontoon erection should be
completed in a month’s time unless heavier
rains than those at present have to be con-
tended with. The Burmese Government has
paid the co. £4500 on account of the road
constructed from the Tenasserim to the dredge
site, has taken over its maintenance and
promises “a further substantial payment.”
Holders’ estimates of the prospects are such
that the 20s. shares have crept, up beyond £2.
Takuapa Valley (Siam) continues dis-
appointing. November last was the month
originally nominated for big yields, and July
finds these unrealised. “Trial runs” of the
plant have been numerous, and now “the
trial run for the month of June” is an-
nounced as though the occurrence represented
something new. “The dredge worked 465
hours, turning over 100,000 yards for 21
tons tin oxide. Time was lost through ad-
justments required to pumps, and three
days owing to floods.” Owing to some
bungle the impellers are unable to lift more
than 5000 gallons of water a minute to
assist the jigs, whereas 9000 gallons are re-
quired in order that the jigs may function
as they should. Thus it is that, although
the slow-moving Takuapa River contains
more flood water than for 20 years
the heart of the plant remains paralysed for
lack of sufficient water beats. To date,
total production is only 28-1 tons, but “open-
ing out operations were over rough ground
with low values.” The belated cablegram
which only announced the June yield on July
6, in the midst of a bear raid on scrip
values, is set down to the debit of the
floods. Meantime, in the absence of actual
production, nothing is said as to methods of
financing; yet heavy sums in cash are re-
quired to make the dredge go.

Mandated Development Co. achieved an-
other scrip-flutter last week, when a radio
announced a little oil at 435 ft., and a geo-
logical forecast of more at 450 ft. Scrip
jumped from 30s. to £5 in a few hours. The
trouble is that the co., having failed in its
quest for more capital to equip its New
Guinea property with a rotary-driller, de-
cided to potter along with the obsolete water
boring plant at its command. This was
shifted from the former sRe, where the origi-
nal bore was capped at 72ft. with 40 gallons
of oil a day making. Boring on the present
site began in March. Capital should be easy
to get if the drill taps anything outsize.
A. J. S. Lindsay, an Adelaide geologist,,
and an assistant are on their way to Madang,
New Guinea, to examine two areas on the
Ramu River for oil on behalf of the
Ramu Oil Development and the Eastern
New Guinea Development. The parent co.
is the Sepik Valley Oil Development Co.,
Ltd. Six oth'er members of the expedition
are to be picked up at Rabaul.

Priminister Bruce, usually so phlegmatic,
showed real feeling last week in defending
Major Story against the blackguardly
attacks, made under cover of Parliamentary
privilege, of Nelson, the voteless chin-wagger
who misrepresents the N.T.; and the wires
have been humming with friendly messages
from his old Digger pals to Story, now Gov-
ernment Secretary at Darwin. Before join-
ing up with the 37th Battalion Story was
a teacher at the Melbourne High School.
On his return he became chairman of the Vic.
War Gratuity Board, and when that insti-
tution petered out he got the N.T. job. Story
once pulled an oar in the Civil Service boat.
Though austere-looking, lie has a big heart,
and tells a rattling good yarn.
Frank McElhone, just gone out at 59,
was Sydney’s original surf-bather 1 . Forty
years ago he entered the water at Bondi with
a small addition to his birthday clothes, later
to be fined a shilling at the Central Police
Court for bathing in a public place. Thereafter
if anyone questioned his right to the title of
pioneer surfer he produced his receipt for
that historic “bob.”
“Sturt”: Dr. Arthur Cudmore, who has
just been superannuated from liis position as
honorary surgeon at Adelaide Hospital, is
only 55; but there is a firm rule, made many
years ago, that each surgeon must retire on
reaching 60, or after 20 years’; service,
“whichever shall first happen.” It is thought
that the old-time framers of the rule did not
expect a man to get a place on the senior
staff before he was 40, and thus the penalty
would not matter. In Cudmore’s case it is
clearly absurd, as he is at the height of his
powers. But there is, of course, the other
point of view, that brilliant younger men
would not be attracted but for the reasonable
certainty of promotion in due course.

Melbourne Labor Day procession will miss
the top-hat of the 96-year-old R. Honeyeombe
at its next walk. Honeyeombe, who used to
be a member of the Stonemasons’ Union, was
given pride of place with another veteran of
the movement; though not on the hrst com-
mittee, be was a supporter of the original
agitation for the eight-hour day. The man
who paced alongside him —-James Wardley,
ex-president of the Bakers' Union—-is 108
years old.
Edward Irving Body, the new president of
the N. S. Wales Sheepbreeders’ Association,
is a member of an old pastoralist family.
Fifty years ago Ins father, F. E. Body, owned
Wambandry and Wonbobbie stations in the
Warren district conjointly with B. R. C. Bird.
Later the old man acquired Buudunar,, in the
Trangie country, and Terramungamine, one
of the earliest squattages in the Dubbo dis-
trict, previously owned by John and William
Maxwell Irving, bis wife's brothers. An old
King’s Scholar, Edward Irving Body was
studying for a medical degree when his
father’s deatn was announced. He straight-
way discarded medicine for the life pastoral,
and has never repented it.

Roderic Quinn, now convalescent after
a serious illness, is likely to be granted
a literary pension; and it will be
worthily bestowed. Quinn modestly claims
to be the only man in Australia wbo has
made a living entirely out of verse, but in
his younger days he wrote a lot of stories,
and his first publication was a novel—“Mos-
tyn Stayne,” issued in 1897. He has had
three collections of mellifluous poetry pub-
lished. He left a job as a schoolteacher to
go rough-riding on Pegasus. While Rod
was sojourning on the South Coast frsf.S.W.)
a couple of years ago he was pointed out
to a voung blood as “Rod Quinn —the great
Rod Quinn.” The young blood subsequently
sought out his informant. “Cripes!” he re-
marked, “I think the bloke with the mo is
foolin’ yez. I don’t believe ’e ever won a
fight in ’is life!”
An unalterable belief that Shakspeare was
somebody else had George Stewart Oaldewell,
who. at 84, has gone to regions where that
controversy may be solved or will not matter.
Caldcwell was a public servant, and at 12
received the remarkable salary (specially
remarkable for those days) of £lOO p.a. for
looking after the Williamstown time-ball. He
remained in the Vic. Astronomer’s Depart-
ment until the Post Office found him; and he
became Deputy-P.M.G. before his retirement.
After that he reorganised the Westralian
branch for the Federal Government. Litera-
ture was a hobby, and he has left a manu-
script developing his theory that Sir Walter
Raleigh found time in his crowded life to be
Shakspeare also.
A man in a London office: —
Hal Colebatch, Groperland’s representative in
London, has other claims to distinction besides the
brevity of his Christian name, the polished phrases
he puts into his post-prandial oratory and the West-
country burr of his accent —he left Herefordshire for
South Aus. at the age of four, bringing his native “r’s”
with him. Colebatch, who started his Inky career
at Broken Hill, was an exceedingly capable all-round
journalist before he forced his way into Parliament,
after several unsuccessful attempts, in 1912. After
some year’s on the W.A. goldfields he returned to
Perth to become a Parliamentary reporter, and in
that capacity he was the storm centre of a quaint
dust-up in 1898. A wire had been sent by him
to a goldfields daily recounting how two members
of the Assembly had engaged in a spirited bout of
fisticuffs in the refreshment-room. The incident, or at
all events the downrightness of the scrap, was hotlv
denied by the legislators concerned, and Parliament,
deciding that its dignity had suffered, summoned the
editor and proprietor of the offending newspaper to
the bar of the House, where they were solemnly
reprimanded. C'olebatch, the author of the telegram,
was dealt with by being refused further entry to
the Press Gallery. Fourteen years passed and he
became an M.L.C., with full freedom of the floor;
16, and he was a Minister and leader of the Upper
House. He was even Premier for a few weeks in
1919, and might have remained in that post for a
few years if he hadn’t lost his head and been bustled
out of his usually cool judgment in the Fremantle
wharf disturbances. The Cabinet to whom he now
finds himself responsible as the State’s London agent
consists of the very men who howled the loudest
for his blood when he caused the Riot Act to be
read gt Fremantle.
“Pick”: An emblem that, if its owner were
disposed to part with it, would find a fitting
place in the Sydney War Museum is a flag
possessed by Digger Tom Murphy of Bung-
endore (N.S.W.). In 1914, when the town
was farewelling its first recruits, Councillor
Chinnery presented them with a flag, and
Tom Murphy undertook to look after the
bit of bunting. Subsequently it fluttered over
his possie in the scorching winds at Suez,
was frayed by the blizzards of Gallipoli, torn
with shot in the muddy trenches of France,
and waved proudly far east of the Hindexi-
burg line at the Armistice. When Tom
was welcomed home again, he handed back
the tattered rag to its donor with no more
ostentation than if it had been a box ot
borrowed matches. There was a general
feeling, however, that he had fairly earned
the trophy, and he was prevailed upon to
keep it.
With the passing of Francis Edward
Rogers, for many years N.S.W. District
Court Judge, goes one of a characteristic
line linking up with Forbes and Dowling.
Of good pioneer stock, Rogers was educated
at Sydney University, and admitted to the
Bar in 1864. He served a long apprentice*
ship as Crown Prosecutor before he got the
job of Chairman of Quarter Sessions. An
upright Judge, with that human charity
which a wide knowledge of life and some
share of personal suffering endow men, was
Rogers.

mentary Grain in Bulk Commission was pre-

He was formerly on the Argus staff, and was

for 23 years. An old band like Oman might
have made some fist of the tiling with a less
efficient ghost, but what new chums like
Weaver, Bath. McDonald and Pollard would
have done without him the Hansard staff
only knows.
Frank Brown, all-round athlete of former
days, buffalo-shooter and overlander, has
done some notable pioneering iu Australia’s
north. He has travelled across the conti-
nent five times, and was the first to bring
a mob of sheep to the Roper River. lie is
off this week to U.S.A. and England on an-
other droving expedition which has as its
objective the bringing to Australia of a mob
of bruisers for Stadiums, Ltd.
Walter Duncan has become Deputy-Whip
for the Government in the Senate, Drake-
Brockman having gone as delegate to the
League of Nations. Duncan was elected in
1919, mainly on the strength of having been
one of Carmichael’s Second Thousand, which
was only 400 or thereabouts. It was as vice-
president, when Carmichael was president,
of a very fighting Clerks’ Union that Duncan
got his first trade-union standing; and he
stood for both Granville and Waverley in
State, and Wentworth in Federal politics,
always putting up a good fight. His first
wife was a daughter of Ted Riley, M.H.R.
for South Sydney; so he has both a father-
in-law and a brother-in-law as opponents in
the Federal Parliament.
August 10 will mark the 90th anni-
versary of the arrival in Sydney of its
first Methodist minister. That was the Rev.
Samuel Leigh, who came out in response
to an invitation sent to headquarters in
England by Thomas Bowden (grandfather
of Eric Bowden, M.H.R. for Nepean) and
a few other earlier Methodist arrivals. They
asked for “a man well supplied with books
and a sound constitution,” and got him.
I.eigh was a sort of ecclesiastical “Flying
Pieman”; he thought nothing of walking
from Sydney to Parramatta to deliver a ser-
mon. He was the first ordained minister to
occupy the pulpit of that ancient Hawkes-
bury River shrine, Ebenezer Church, the
oldest place of worship standing in Australia.
After firmly establishing Methodism in the
colony, he returned to England while still
in vigoroixs middle-age.
“Daniel Thorn”: “H.K.” (B. 20/6/’25)
has made a slip or two in his par. about the
old Woolpack Hotel, Parramatta. It was
Nat., not Andrew, Payten who was pro-
prietor of the Woolpack and laid down the
first bowling-gi-een in Australia. (I helped
him myself with the green when young.) He
retired from business in the late ’seventies.
Like most of the Paytens, he was a keen
sportsman, and had few equals as a “whip.”
Andrew Payten, who was _Nat.’s brother,
kept the old Red Cow Hotel in George-street,
Parramatta, at a much earlier period. After
retiring he lived at Deskford, at the back of
the old Domain. A.third brother was Harry
Payten, a champion. pigeon-shot of his day.

officer to handle that Old World relic, the

was once a cavalry weapon, it is rather
appropriate that a galloping major should

About a minor Speck:—
The unchallenged Grand Old Man of King Island,
William Ilickmott, is now verging on 90. When
lie settled on the fragment, 65 years ago, a few
sealers and hunters were its only inhabitants. Lying
about halfway between Victoria uni Tasmania, the
island, 40 miles in length, has been the scene of
41 recorded shipwrecks, 27 of which have happened
during Mi - . Hickmott’s residence. The immigrant
ships Neva, Catarique and British Admiral, which
met disaster there, accounted for a total loss of
704 souls, the survivors numbering only 34. With
a population of, roughly, 1000, the island contributed
168 men to the war, 29 making the supreme sacri-
fice. Mr. Hickmott tells of the Golden Age when
kangaroo and wallaby, long since exterminated, were
plentiful. Father Shaw brought the little community
into the daily world with a high-power wireless
installation which he erected 15 years ago.
Mrs. Annie Robertson, of Skene, Hamil-
ton (Vic.), who has given £lOOO to establish
a scholarship at Balmoral State School, is
the widow of James Gordon Robertson, a
Western district sub-squatter. One of the
family possessions was Kongbool Estate,
31,756 acres, which was sold to the Closer
Settlement Board three years ago, for
£111,147. The scholarship is intended as a
memorial of J.G.R., who was always a gener-
ous fellow. Knowledge of the Ten Com-
mandments and the Lord’s Prayer is one
condition Mrs. Robertson wishes incorporated
in the requirements, and she expresses pre-
ference for technical training. With a trade
on his hands, the Decalogue as a staff, and
“Our Father” as a compass, a youth, she
thinks, would have a fair chance of making
a successful pilgrimage through this imperfect
world.
Coleman Phillips, a big pea in the Wairarapa
(M.L.), has just died, aged 78. He did mueh
to foster trade between M.L. and the South
Sea Islands in the ’seventies, and threshed
those seas on some strange craft. He shipped
the first lot of frozen meat from Wellington
to London in 1883; introduced Holstein
cattle to M.L. in 1887; constructed the first
water-race in the North Island in 1894, and
packed apples for export in 1888. He was a
barrister of the Supreme Court, hut didn’t
worry much about that.
The name of Andrew Smith, father of air-
men Keith and Ross Smith, is to be com-
memorated in an unusual way. The Mutoo-
roo (S.A.) Pastoral Co., with which he
was long associated, has bought about 150
square miles in a subdividing of the neigh-
boring Boolcoomatta station, and this new
block is to be known —officially and with the
sanction of the Surveyor-General of the State
—as St. Andrew’s.
The death of the widow of Francis Ormond
brings an additional benefaction of £50,000
to the Melbourne Working Men’s College,
which, if a strong agitation now proceeding
succeeds, will have a new name shortly. This
£50.000 was tied up by the founder of the
College to provide an annuity to the widow.
The institution can do with the money, as
big extensions are proposed.

13th February 1925.
Dear Mr Roberts,
with reference to my letter of the
23rd of December last, I ara commanded to say that The
Queen has now seen the Pianoforte which you sent to
Buckingham Palace,last month on behalf of Messrs Beale
of Sydney, New South Wales.
Her Majesty is much pleased with the tom
of the instrument, and greatly admires the workmanship
of the beautiful case.
Believe me,
Yours faithfully,

ER MAJESTY QUEEN MARY
graciously commanded the accompanying letter to be
sent to the London representative of Beale & Company
Ltd., in relation to a Beale Piano chosen and purchased by
the Queen at Wembley Exhibition in November last.
Her Majesty’s admiration of the Beale Piano—more especi-
ally her endorsement of its tonal quality is fitting con-
summation to the years of industrial effort which have
resulted in an instrument of such undoubted excellence.
The piano purchased by the Queen was not specially con-
structed for Her Majesty, but was chosen for its beautiful
The same matchless tone that has inspired so much approval
among musicians who know piano quality thoroughly, will
equally impress the private owner.
tone and admirable casework from the rest of the Beale
Exhibits at Wembley.
The judgment of the first Hostess of the Empire —famed
for her mature knowledge and keen perception —may safely
be relied on by all music-lovers. In addition to the Royal
preference, there is the further fact that in August last,
Nineteen Beale Pianos were purchased by the N.S.W. State
Conservatorium on the recommendation of musical experts
— recognition which establishes beyond doubt the pre-emi-
nence of the New Beale Piano as a musical instrument.
The Beale Piano is priced within the reach of the moder-
ate purse. The balance remaining after deducting the value of
your old piano is cared for by our system of easy payments.

"H. Hardupp”: “A good dog? Well I

admiration of the kelpie’s work. ‘‘lt’s hereditary

for years, and I remember sending ’er out one day
on ’er own to find six ewes which ’ad strayed away.
It was rough country round my place, and 1 wasn’t
surprised when she was still away next day; but
after a week or two 1 got anxious, and I’d have
gone out to look for her, only something or another
kept me back day after day. I was beginning to
think I’d never see the old slut again when one
day I heard a bark, and, rushing out, there I sees
her driving them six ewes home. But when I took
another look I could hardly believe my eyes. At
the back of them six ewes was six lambs, each one
of ’em being driven in by n puppy hardly able to
walk, and their mother was just barking to encour-
age ’em in learning their trade. That’s the sort
ot' breeding that’s in that dog! ” He became

“Up North”: Some of the tropical lagoons
in the Gulf country and the Northern Territory arc
alive with birds. Every species of wild duck, untold
varieties of pigeons, flocks of galahs and cockatoos
that cloud the sky make these lonely lakes a bedlam
of sound. Wild geese, brolgas, jaberoo, a locally-
called “spoonbill,” cranes, ibis, plover and many
feathered things unknown to me crowd the shallow
mud and sandy reaches. Flocks of screeching, bril-
liantly-plumaged parrots and uncountable mobs of
smaller birds keep the branches of the thousand
trees trembling when they come twice a day for
water and a chit-chat. In the Territorial swamps
the lover of larger game has the buffalo, and on
the Queensland side the wild pig. But the most-
prized game for the camp-fire is a species of pygmy
goose. Only about the size of a duck, it wears a
white waistcoat, a nearly-black coat, and has dark
wings flicked with sheeny green.

-“ Jim C.”: “Wandi” (B. 18/t>/'25) is
right about the catfish being thrown away in disgust.,
although a superior table-fish to many that are used.
But he does not give the reason. Scores of fishermen
firmly believe that the head of the catfish is poisonous.
How or when this absurd idea originated I don't
know, but it is deeply rooted. “Wandi” describes
a catfish nest as built of pebbles, but stones would
be a better name for the building material. Sonic
of the stones in nests I have seen have weighed
over two pounds, and as a rule there isn’t another
stone to be found anywhere within yards of the
bungalow.
“Pick” : When on wing the plain turkey
(Australian bustard) is a strong, speedy flier and
can travel hundreds of miles without alighting.
He, however, always takes a 50-yard run before
rising, and for that reason is tardy at getting into
flight when an enemy appeals. He often prefers to
hide, and this is his undoing. On the plains a
hunter finds it a sheer impossibility to stalk the
buzzard. Uncanny in his elusiveness, he keeps just
out of gun range, quietly marching on as he is being
encircled or sneaked upon, and is never induced to
approach a sand-rise or cover, beyond which another
gun may be lying in wait. To get him, therefore,
the knowing hunter adopts a plan that would De
fatal if tried upon other game. He rushes suddenly
into view of the turkeys, and approaches them swiftly
All the birds of the flock at; once squat. With necks
outstretched and heads planted in the tussocks, they
believe themselves invisible, and fail to observe the
coming danger. When, too late, they finally set off
cn their preliminary run, it is a poor shot that cannot
roll over two or three before they get steam up.
“Itiorn ': Has any Abo. seen a professional
lady bulloeky? Before the railway reached Sale,
Mrs. Bunting was a familiar figure around Port
Albert (Vic.). Slle' boasted that she was the first
person to drive a waggon-load of stores to Walhalla,
a feat demanding much courage and fortitude. Rough
in exterior but kind in heart, with an elementary
knowledge of medicine, she was looked on as “a
good fellow” by the pioneering spirits. She lived
to be upwards of 80, and was quite as original a
character as Meg Merrilies.

“Brady's Look-out” : Flourmills driven by
the Speck's ample water-power were at work in
most of the Tasmanian wheatgrowing districts in
the ’fifties. They may not all have had Tasmanian
blue-stone bearings, but one mill that began grinding
about 100 years ago, near New Norfolk, certainly
had them. Shortage of the usual metal accounted for
their use. Anyway, they stood up to the work
splendidly for about 60 years, and then continued to
carry the wheel on its new job of generating
electric current.

“Bol” : Dad found considerable difficulty
in discovering how the pig got into the potato-patch,
which was surrounded with bracken fern. At last
he observed that the destroyer entered through
a hollow log shaped like the letter L. Then he
had a brain wave. He turned the log round so
that both entrance and exit were into the paddock,
and sat down to await developments. The pig
entered as usual, and, emerging, was amazed to find
the Irish apples still as far off as evei'. Undaunted
he made three attempts to reach the heaven of
succulent roots. After the third try he realised
that something dreadful had happened. Rearing up
on his hind legs he expressed his feelings in a
long, loud snort, and then scampered off across the
paddock as if 100 unseen devils were in pursuit.

“J.G.”: Here is my little list of the best
ornamental flowering-trees in the world; they are
all dinkum Au&sies, too, being members of the
health-giving eucalyptus family. The E. ficifolia, V..
macrocarpa, E. erythrocorys , E. caesia, E. erythro-
nema, E. pyrifornvU, E. .tetraptera and E. torquata are
all bright-red and crimson-flowering gums, erythro-
corys being probably the best of a very beautiful lot.
Pink-flowering gums are E. calophylla rosea and E.
Icucoxylon rosea, the former being, I think, the most
handsome flowering-tree in the world. Yellow-flower-
ing gums are E. crucis (or Southern Cross), E.
eremophylla, E. preitsiana, E. stricklandii and E.
tetragona. All these are very striking when in
bloom, their colors ranging from bright orange shades
to cream. They all grow very shapely, produce
Dretty foliage, and consequently are handsome trees
even when not in flower, &. ‘cdtophyll'd is the best
of the white-tiowefing sorts. 1 wish I could quote
them by sihiple naiiies, but we have been stupid
enough not to applV thehi. What about doing it?

“Buttenderry”: .The theory, that the
water of Lake Lyre constitutes a reservoir for the
sub-artesian supply of the. West is, I think, based on
false premises. Even if the level of the lake did
not rise in flood-time^ —and “Nitric” (B. 1/6/’25) has

been misinformed on that point—the several swollen
rivers which empty into it would reinforce the sub-
artesian supply, and this in the wet seasons would
be reflected at the bore-heads by increased pressure
and output; and that is not the case. The origin
of the bulrushes along the drains and nowhere else,
and the presence of tiny semi-transparent fish, which
are quite at home in extremely hot water, has always
puzzled me: but, after filling innumerable water-
bags, quartpots and other vessels at many different
bores. I have concluded that the one place they
certainly did not come from was the bore itself.
“Bill R.” : That starlings banquet on sheep
ticks (B. 18/b/’25) is known to every wool-'owuer
where the birds are found. Not only do they clean
vermin from shqrn sheep, but they beak down for
their breakfast and catch ticks in the densest and
longest wool. Infested sheep plainly welcome their
attentions. Incidentally, in another direction the
starling is a sheepman’s friend. By eradicating the
ticks he enables many a cocky to evade the S. P,
Board’s ukase that sheep must be annually dipped.

passed on its way into the yard; then it would dart
directly at the animal’s eyes. The climax was
reached when my friend’s wife caught the bird in
the act of picking at her two-year-old baby’s eyes.
It was tried, found guilty, and cracked on the head.
“Ento": “Slam” affirms (B. 11/G/'25)
that “the worst insect pests in Australia are immi-
grants,” but he shouldn't have mentioned the fruit-
fly. Until a few years ago the Queensland fruit-fly
was considered to be one species attacking native
and cultivated fruits alike. Then the solarium fruit-
fly was isolated, followed by the recognition of the
Jarvis fruit-fly. The recently discovered Bancroft's
fruit-fly makes the third undoubtedly indigenous
species that had originally been included under one
name and regarded as a probable importation. How
much of the residue may have been introduced is
unknown. Prof. E. J. Goddard and F. A. Perkins,
who are going to the root of the subject and know
more about it than "Slam” or I, have no evidence
that there has been any importation. They consider
the matter to be one of possibility only. Imported
pests do not have it all their own way with regard
to destructibility. There are blowflies, for instance,
whilst the little Brisbane leaf-miner, a moth of the
silver wattle, has recently threatened the extermination
of that ornamental shrub in the Sydney Botanical
Gardens. It has yet to be shown that the thrip
associated with banana rust is an alien. Our cane-
fields, with their indigenous grey-back and other
beetles, must not be forgotten, nor yet the many
pests of the cotton plant. All these are doing as
much damage as the imported curses mentioned by
“Slam,” perhaps more.
“ Bill R.”: Rescuers in boats navigating
among the partly submerged houses at East Goulburn
(N.S.W.) during one of the deluges heard doleful
whimperings from a flooded back-yard, and traced
them to a chained dog. Forgotten and abandoned,
the poor fellow had scrambled to the roof of bis
kennel. On that unsteady platform lie had stood
throughout the night as the waters gradually rose.
When rescued next morning from the roof-tree of his
cabin, his nose alone appeared above the surface.
How he had managed to retain his narrow foothold
during the long hours and against the swirl of the
rushing current was matter for wonder.

“Billy See” : Touching those “Rambles of an
Australian Naturalist” (B. 28/5/’2o), I have never yet
located a springing centipede I7in. long, although
I have lived and still live in districts where it is
supposed to flourish; Neither call I discover the
embalmed specimen ill the Perth \lusehm. 'The
barking lizard is also a mystery to tile. However, till
“jumping snake” seems capable of explanation.
Thomas Ward describes it as a lizard about a foot
or more in length. He does not deny its powers of
running, but stresses its ability to jump. On the
Westraiiali goldfields 1 have occasionally seen a
small lizard with over-developed hind legs which
scuttled off in a curious kangaroo fashion, giving
the impression of a two-legged snake. Unlike most
lizards, it was a slick sprinter, and perhaps if
chased might have jumped as described.
* * * *
“Jim Carew” i While out shooting neat
Gobargo (X.S.W.) I noticed two big flocks of white
cockatoos flying towards each other at a breakneck
pace. When about 20 yards distant each leader
uttered a warning squawk, but neither seemed inclined
to get out of the other’s way. A split second later
they met, head on. For a few moments over a thou-
HADN’T NOTICED ANYTHING.

rough around these parts?”
HARDENED OLD SALT : “So we ARE at sea!
I thought we was still tied up along-
side.”
sand shrieking birds were mixed in one bunch;
then suddenly each flock sorted itself out and went
on its way. Neither body came off lightly, for over
30 dead or injured birds fell to the ground, and
there were many stragglers.

DANNY’S ELDORADO.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
"Twas in the early ’nineties old Danny Dobson said:
“I’ll strike that El Dorado—it isn’t far ahead.
Yes, somewhere in these ranges it’s playing hide
and seek,
To lui'e the strong and patient, to scare away the
weak,
"“It slyly uses silence to hide its whereabouts —•
A trick" of El Dorados to fashion fears and doubts.
Unceasingly I seek it from morning until night—
But still it always manages to keep just out of sight.
-“l’ve costeened all the ridges, I’ve panned off tons
of loam,
Trying to trace that fortune, trying to find its home.
i ve tapped each likely outcrop, spit-visioned every
scrap
Of quartz that may have drifted from somewhere near
the ‘cap.’
"f ve sluiced the little gullies on very rainy days,
Or when the mists were heavy, the forest aisles a
maze ;
I've gone to camp, clothes sopping through crossing
swollen streams — ,
But soon that fortune glittered in the forefront oi
my dreams.
“I’m growing old, my shoulders are getting rather
bent,
At times my toughened stomach reveals its discon-
tent.
My feet are dragging heavy—they feel like leaded
lumps ;
My heart, too, is long weary—protestingly it pumps.
“But; by the campfire nightly, when sparkling heat
consoles,
My El Dorado graces my gallery of coals.
And I shall one day find it and all my dreams come
true;
I’ll find on some glad morning at last I’ve battled
through !”

National Wealth Australians haVe created for Themselves
£BOO,OOO added to national assets , in buildings and equipment !
9 Remunerative employment for 1800 skilled Australian Workers !
Over £1,000,000 added annually to the production-total ot
Australian-made goods !
THE above facts and figures relate
only to the industries conducted
by Geo. A. Bond O Go. Ltd., but
they constitute practical proof, in face
of any theory, of the benefits that
accrue to Australians through the
purchase of goods made in their own
country.
The buildings of Geo. A. Bond 0 Co.
Ltd. are the work of Australian brains
and hands. The immense variety of
materials and the many types of labor
required in their erection represent a
vast sum paid out to Australians.
The completely-equipped buildings are a
valuable NATIONAL asset, that pays big
dividends to the community, since they
enable 1800 highly paid Australians to
produce efficiently, every year, over
£1,000,000 worth of goods required by
Australian men, women and children.
And it is Australians themselves who
have created the wealth thus represented.
If the Australian Public had not
consistently favored the Australian-made
article, as represented by goods carrying
BOND’S label, the present giant enterprises
of Geo. A. Bond 0 Co. Ltd. would have
been stifled at birth. Buildings such as
BOND’S would be adding grace to a foreign
landscape—workers overseas would be re-
ceiving the money now paid to 1800 Aust-
ralians, who would probably be swelling
the ranks of the unemployed, and over
£1,000,000 now being added annually to
Australia’s income would be increasing our
import totals and adding to our burden of
foreign debt.
So always remember that in buying Aust-
ralian-made. goods, you are helping your
own country and yourself. Whenever you
are choosing Silk Hosiery, Half'Hose for
men, Sox for the kiddies, Underwear for
men, women, or boys, Sheeting or
always specify " BOND’S.” Remember this
too, that in so doing, you are making no
sacrifice, since the presence of BOND’S
LABEL on an article is a guarantee that it is
the best of its kind at the price paid.

“Polycarp” : After many an argument
about the nesting habits of the big bluewing duck
or Australian shoveller —poor flier but marvellous
diver —I was able to clinch the matter by personal
observation. I saw a downy chick tumble out of a
holiow in a big gum growing in a swamp, and then
swim away among tne rushes. Presently another
followed suit. Investigation showed an untidy grass
nest filling a decayed hollow about five feet above
the surface of the water, and on the day I went
stickybeaking there was still one duckling in the
tree, five being out with the old ducks on the swamp.
Queensland bushmen swear that bluewings often build
in trees at some distance from water, and that each
younker, in that case, is carried to the ground by
the bill of the mother, reaching the water on foot.
• * * *
“James B.” : In a par. (B. 18/6/ 25) refer-
ring to the ducks on Lake George (N.S.W.) in the
’sixties, the word “millions” and not “thousands”
would have been correct. Only one who saw the
lake in those days could form any conception of
their countless numbers. The like will nevei be
seen again in Australia; perhaps not in the world.
At that time, Lake George had a coastline of
nearly 100 miles, and no matter where you approached
it you came on solid masses of ducks. As you
neared the water those directly in front began to
move out from the edge,, their companions on either
side extended more slowly, and by the time you
reached the edge there was a semi-circle of a
bank of ducks with supporting columns on either
side as far as could be seen. All round the lake it
was the same. Fire a gun, and they rose in
clouds, with a noise like thunder. In ’67, a
week’s rain raised the water level a few feet. It
was the laying season, and the shore was strewn with
eggs laid by every species of waterfowl. For some
time afterwards the neighborhood smelt like a hundred
bonemills.
* * * *
“Bunya” : Has anyone ever seen a moth-
owl or night-jar perch? I doubt if this bird can
grasp a branch, or if it uses the trees at all. It
seems to live entirely on the ground or in the air.
I have often seen night-jars (by the way, why
"goat-suckers”?) at night continually hovering about
an out-door fire in the bush, following the insects
attracted by the light. The single egg, laid on
the bare ground, is not
nearly as well camou-
flaged as the curlew’s
or most other ground
nesters’, being of a
light color with rather
prominent dark spots.
The newly-hatched bird
is, on the other hand,
perfectly disguised in
its reddish-brown down,
and will not move till
almost trodden upon.
Indeed, Australia seems
to have a far greater
proportion of totally
nestless birds than most
other countries. Several
of the native quails
and ground pigeons, all
the cockatoos and par-
rots except two, and
all the owls make no
attempt at nest build-
ing, but lay either on
the bare ground or on
the decayed wood in-
side hollow limbs of
trees. The ground,
sometimes a slight un-
lined hollow, is the
nesting site not only of
the night jar, but of
the plain wanderer, the
dotterels, several of the
plovers, the curlew and
the pied oyster-catcher.
The jackass does not
even collect a stick,
and, among the birds
of prey, the falcons
build no nests. Either
a stick nest is com-
mandeered from some
other bird, as is the
habit of the grey and
the black falcons, or
the eggs are laid on a
bare rock or cliff ledge,
that being the common-
est nest of the dash-
in g b 1 a c k-cheelced
falcon. Probably this is only half the list.
“Gouger”: I know one authentic case of
a good-luck charm working apparent miracles.
“Darkie” Dawson is the owner, and opal-miners well
remember his luckless ventures on White Cliffs and
the Ridge. Many and many a time “Darkie” car-
ried his swag from those two fields after months
of bullocking toil. After the last of numerous dis-
appointments he came across an overturned cart with
an Indian hawker pinned underneath. The man was
dying, and Dawson went to a lot of trouble to make
him comfortable. Before he passed out the grateful
Indian handed Dawson a curiously patterned black:
opal which, he whispered, was a good-luck charm
of inestimable value. Darkie tramped back to the
Ridge, determined to give it another “fly.” His
first shaft bottomed on opal. Thereafter for two
years he couldn’t get off opal. He bought himself
a natty sheep-selection, the ambition of all Ridge
gougers. He then put in four years at the war,
got through it with perfect health and minus a
scratch, then returned to find a wife who is certain
the sun shines out of her hubby’s nuggety little
frame. He has a son who is already game to ride
anything with hair on, two others who think the
world is a place made for them to laugh in, and
A RANK OUTSIDER.
JACKEROO : “I think he must he a half-caste.”
JACKY: “ Baal half-cask. Baal that eye belongin’ to black phella,
baal belongin’ to white phella. Mine tinkit that pholla
plurry wrong ’un, boss.”
a miniature daughter who promises to be even as
fine a woman as her mother. He’s backed the last
four Melbourne Cup winners. His wool-clip always
tops the market, and his merino rams flock up to
94 p.c. Only one dread clouds “Darkie’s” happy
horizon. It is with him both day and n’ght. He’s
afraid of losing the curious black opal that from
the day the Indian died has never left the little
bag round his neck.
• « * *
“Wingella”: I can assure “W.J.C.” (B.
16/4/’25) that the N.T. abos. are not circumcised
with a piece of broken glass. The operation is
performed with quartz or flint triangular knives.
The less naise a boy makes during the cutting the
braver warrior will he become, so at every cut the
king makes the surrounding ring of warriors howl
in unison, thus drowning any other sound. Tribal
marks are also made with these clumsy-looking knives.
The tribal cuts are made to a certain depth, and then,
the lips of the wound being pulled apart, fine ashes
are sprinkled thickly in the orifice. The gash heals
slowly, leaving cicatrices that in many cases are
as thick as a man’s finger, though they vary according
to the abo.’s tribe. A nigger working for me
recently had three newly-made marks across the
cheeks of his buttocks, but though hideous-looking
wounds they did not interfere with his working in
any way. So proud was Biah of his new markings
that he absolutely refused to wear anything save a
curtain tassel.
* * * *
“Mepliisto”: There are many ways of
getting drinks out back without paying for them.
I knew a dingo-trapper who frequented Blackall
(W.Q.), where, if not supplied with free booze, he
would threaten to scatter some of his home-made dog-
decoy about the premises. A refusal meant an
immediate invasion by all the mongrels of the town,
and few of the bar-tenders cared to risk it. Another
adventurous and thirsty perse n presented himself at
quite a number of hotels with a card which set forth
his occupation as that of a Government “drink-tester.”
It seems hardly credible that he should have been
believed; nevertheless, he was —until he became too
drunk to explain his mission coherently. Lastly, I
once encotntered a sparrer for alcohol who was wont
to conceal a snake in his shirt, and, on approaching
the bar, to release it. He generally scored a few
pints.
• * * *
“Pick”: “Tarago” is not explicit enough
about his bay horse turning grey (B. 25/6/’25) ;
a correct diagnosis is impossible without further
information. Brown or bay horses the progeny of u
roan mother or sire will often, especially in good
seasons, become a whitish grey at the spring of the
year, returning to the original color as their hair
lengthens with the approach of winter. Where
galled by saddle or harness, light bays will almost
invariably turn grey in patches. A brown horse
rescued after a severe scorching in a burning stable
at a South Coast (N.S.W.) hotel became an almost
complete grey when the skin and hair grew on him
again. Foals born white that afterwards, as they
mature, change color to roan, chestnut or brown,
often return to white or grey with advancing age.
“W.J.C.”: For sheer ability to cling to
existence, despite adverse environment, the lower
forms of life can give man many points. The record
is surely held by the sporing bacteria. Material
from the tombs of the Pharaohs has been shown to
carry spores of bacteria
thousands of years old,
the spore being a rest-
ing stage in the life
of the organism, and
much more resistant to
external influences than
is the germ proper.
But bring the spore
into surroundings favor-
able to the growth and
multiplication of the
germs and it takes on
again the germ form.
Some others of the
lower forms show a
similar ability to trans-
form themselves into
bodies resistant to ad-
verse environment. In
all of our ponds there
are myriads of small
forms of water life,
many visible to the
naked eye and often dis-
tinctly beautiful. The
Cyclops vulgaris, easily
seen, is an exquisite
thing, especially the
female with her two
bunches of eggs, like
clusters of grapes, one
on either flank. It
would amply repay any-
one to buy a cheap
microscope and watch
the whirlings and pir-
ouettings of the Roti-
fera. If a bottle of
pond water containing
these be allowed to dry
out, and though it
stand dry for ever so
long, they will, on the
bottle being recharged
with water, be frisky
as ever in a few hours,
provided no common
enemy has consumed
them during the days
of desiccation.
“S.C.” : Nearly all the smaller varieties
of hawks will eat mice, and larger rodents, too,
if they can get them (B. 25/6/’25). I can’t agree
with “Cycas,” however, about the nankeen kestrel
(Cerchneis cenchroides) appropriating old babbleis .
crows’ or magpies’ nests; this bird invariably nests
in the hollow or spout of a tree. The two species
of lazy brown hawks do commandeer suitable stick-
nests occasionally and build them up a little. Most
of the owls are fine inousers, and I have seen
a magpie on the topmost twig of a pine-tree with
a freshly-caught mouse in its claws. The mopoke
and the bustard also include mice in their menu.
It is a pity the farmer doesn’t more generally recog-
nise and protect his avian friends. Quite inoffensive
and useful hawks are often shot as being chicken-
stealers, and mopokes and owls are wantonly de-
stroyed by casual gunners, although all these birds
are now protected by legislative enactment.
SAFETY IN ROUGHNESS.
“I s’pose you get some lawless characters in
this locality?”
“No, y' wanner go down on the noo road in
get THEM. It’s too flamin’ rough jet-
cars to come up ’ere.”
“Nitric”: Re “Jackeroo’s” recent query
whether horses that are lucerne-fed make a habit 0’
eating various tree barks —he quotes the willow.
At present I have two saddle-horses in my yard, anti
both are chaff- and corn-fed, yet they seek their dessert
in the bark of “pepper” and poplar trees. In
the case of the latter they chew off dead branches,
which certainly do not look appetising. My theory
is that they are seeking for necessary ingredients not
present in their ordinary feed, just as cattle will
go for miles to a salt-lick.

Dew-laden strays, while, pale and strange,
V lone wan star steals shyly forth
Above the loom of the Barrier Range.
Tired-out by travel the horses stand
With drooping heads at the stockyard gate;
A dingo hOwls on a distant slope,
And howls in answer his wakened mate.
Howl answers howl as they leave their lairs,
Dark caves, scrub-hidden, in some lone hill;
To-night, fleet-footed and keen of fang,
They’ll rend and ravage, and maim and kill.
The air turns chill in the deepening dusk,
A thick dew falls and the soil grows damp ;
Wild-fowl belated, surprised by night,
Fly west, swift-winged, to their water-camp.
By gloom enshrouded, in darkness set,
The broken hills in the distance frown;
Like sentinels on a lone night-watch
Above them coldly the stars look down.
Above the creek and the creek-side gums
Dim mists upwreath and wraith-like hang;
A far, faint call from a night-bird comes—
A death-cry silenced by beak or fang.
Around a lamp that softly glows
Grey moths and green-winged night-things flit
Unwatched by two, who wordlessly
Beside their fire of mulga sit.
A dream-mood born of soundless deeps,
Of stirless gloom and pale star gleams
And trees that muse, invades the room
And makes the room a place of dreams,
A DAWES PLAN.

Eyes fixed upon the glowing hearth
The two men sit; though, hand and heart,
They have been mates on many tracks,
To-night they stray lone tracks apart.
Lone tracks they tread, tracks worn and old,
Tracks rough with care or sweet with bliss,
And though they have been friends long years,
Yet each to each a stranger is.
Thus dreaming, thus with musing eyes,
Through firelit hours they forward lean,
Each moving in his own thought-realm,
The red, red mulga fire between.
Thus, thus they lose themselves, these twain
Made wanderers by the moment’s power,
While ruddy flakes to ashes turn
As silken white as new-milled flour.
Through windows anl through doorways wide
Keen gusts of coolness .inward flow;
Outside the sheep-dog barks again—
Barks once, maybe at some dream foe.

torn from the beasts of the jungle. One
fair creature, like an Amazon returning from
the chase, had a grinning grey white wolf
slung from shoulder to skirt-hem. Mink,
ermine, sable, seal, 'possum and rabbit
mingled in the menagerie on the lawn and
in the stands. Squirrel capes were prevalent
additions. Wraps and coats, fur, or fluffed
wool-collared and -cuffed, overshadowed en-
semble suits as fifty to one. Everywhere a
bunch of violets, a bit of daphne or a nice
seasonable sprig of holly brightened up tlie
fur; and gaily-colored millinery also cheered
dull covering. Cherry and tan tones, with
lots of “pull-ons” in the new fuchsia shades,
made radiance. Gov. Stradbroke was
there, like a peninsula, almost entirely
surrounded by chairman L. K. S. Mac-
kinnon and his wife, Mr. and Mrs.
Alan Currie, the Leonards, Mayor and
Mrs. Reynolds, Mrs. W. Winter Irving and
her bride-daughter, Mrs Bruce Mead, and
other racing folk. Prime Minister Bruce
had Mrs. Bruce, in an ermine collar reliev-
ing an all-black toilette. Mrs. Colin Fraser
was a cross-word puzzle, plus a hat of grey,
llou. Mrs. Lindsay, in ether waves of grey,
black and a dash of red, topped by a navy
and white toque, led about her flapper daugh-
ter, in navy with a mist-hued hat upon her
two plaits. The chill stone pavement of the
new stand ate like sin into shoe-soles that
covered stockings in wonderful checks and
stripes, which, though chiefly hideous, at
least provided a bit of warmth.
The opening of the State Parliament —
the 28th of its kind or species—drew the
usual crowd of onlookers within and with-
out. A band and a military guard of honor
were the only signs of pomp; the gilt is
reserved for the Federal Parliament ginger-
bread. Visitors crowded all the available
seating: therefore members of tlie legisla-
tures, on being summoned, did not get beyond
the entrance to the Chamber, and the Gov-
ernors request, “Gentlemen, be seated,” was
greeted with a titter. Lady Stradbroke’s
ensemble suit of black and black-
plumaged millinery made a sombre ex-
clamation-mark amid the gay plumage
of the legislators’ womenfolk. Mrs.
Robert Lindsay, alongside her, aired the
last trumpet-blast of beaded finery in a short
coat worked all over in floral design, topping
a nigger-brown frock, and a small hat upon
which perched two pink roses and a grove of
verdure. The Speaker and Mrs. John Bow-
ser (in coat-froek of black and white) dis-
pensed tea after the ceremony. The refresh-
ing was a scrum from which the vice-regal
cake and sandwich were only saved by being
valiantly protected. Mrs. Wilson, wife of
the Soustralian Senator, aired a charming
black rose-trimmed hat above a navy suit.
Mrs. Premier Allan was robed in black, with
millinery decked with grey plumes. Mayoress
Brunton was in ensemble suit, all-over em-
broidered in black and dull gold, and toning
millinery, and Mrs. Cohen combined tones
from brown to fawn in her gown and hat.
Members of the State Parliament and tlieir
womenfolk were bidden by Governor Strad-
broke and his Countess to fraternise at
Stonington on the eve of the opening of the
session. Guests whose cold hands were
clasped in greeting in the lounge, all pink
heath and roses, with tlie extra glow of a
blazing Are, passed into tlie drawing-room,
which was heavy with the scent of narcissi
and wattle. Soon the House was sitting, the
band failing to drown the fortissimo of voices,
for even the chicken-sandwiches could not
stop tongues wagging. Lady Stradbroke was
a willowy figure whose jewels caused some
of the invited to murmur with Marguerite:
“Can they be ree-al?” One diamond neck-
lace, another with big pear-shaped pearl-
drops, long diamond ear-rings and a brow-
band with more diamonds was tlie inventory.
Alexander Peacock’s lady, in black marocain
chenille, embossed witli dahlia tones, shared
dress honors with Mrs. W. Angliss, arrayed
in dull gold lace over old rose.
The portion of the comedy “The Broken
Wing” which was not damaged beyond re-
pair on the aeroplane’s first bump at the
King's Theatre on Saturday night did not
admit of lmich arresting frocking, since the
flier descends upon a Mexican ranch. Thur-
ston Hall is a fascinating Spanish captain
in chocolate-soldier uniforms. Gladys Web-
ster airs one attractive bit of evening cover-
ing in white crepe marocain crystal-beaded.
A couple of striking shawls go with dresses
of zephyr and frilled muslin. A bit of New
York is brought upon the scene by Madge
North, in an ensemble suit of nigger-brown,
fur-trimmed, and upturned millinery of the
same hue. Very charming is Sylvia Clifton
as the Spanish maid Ouichita, with a dash
of red accompanying all her wardrobe and
big ear-rings. The counter-attraction of a
Kreisler concert drew the usual first-viewers
away, and high Society, including the vice-
regal had foregathered at the
Herbert Brookes* mansion, where pianist
Goll and violinist Henri Verbrugglien were
being- heard in lofty harmonies. George
Tallis and his dame cast approving glances
from a box. General Monasli. who had a
possie in the stalls, Mr. and Mrs. H. Cox,
Mrs. Iv. McClelland, Mrs. Attiwell and Miss
Bentwitch were among those present at the
new theatrical offering.
The State Governor was pressed into ser-
vice for opening a loan exhibition of 400
pictures by 100 Australian artists at the
National Gallery last week. Incidentally,
some of the loaned have come from Govern-
ment House, and included in these, contribu-
tions are two exceedingly clever water-colors
by the Hon. Christopher Rous, the Gover-
nors small son who so lately crossed the
Great Divide. For the age of eight Christo-
pher showed rare talent. In “The Bridge”
there is the promise of a Hilder in the
making—promise which is now only a
memory of an ever-smiling small boy. John
Longstaff shows among his portrait' gallery
one of Nina Murdoch, wife of the popular
“Brownie,” of the Sun Pictorial, who is
the first Australian, journalist to have her
good looks immortalised thus. No collection
of Lambert’s ever being complete without
one of the artist himself, there is “Me Tying
Me Cravat, by Me.” The show is really the
first big effort to gather together the output
of Australia’s best wielders of brush and
palette. The exhibition ivill run for about
six weeks, with various afternoon concerts to
push it along.
The Auditorium stage was a flower-show
for Rosa Pinkerton, of the warm soprano
notes, at her farewell warbling before she
goes Londonwards by the Osterley. Rosa,
who is a University Con. product, raised an
attractive voice in operatic excerpts and
artistic songs, to which Edward Goll and vio-
linist Bernard Heinze added the Cesar Franck
sonata and some Chopin. Henri Ver-
brugghen, who arrived in Melbourne on the
same day. dropped in, later crossing the
street to the Assembly Hall to hear some of
Fritz Hart’s recent works and meet Kreisler.
The social limelight w r ill presently fall on
the lady photographed here by Lafayette.
Slic is Mrs.
Norman L.
Anderson, wife
of the Acting-
Consul - Gen-
eral for U.S.A.
The coming of
the American
Fleet means
many crowded
hours for both
herself and her
husband, who
has been in
Melbourne for
two years.
His refer-
ences include
diplomatic ser-
vice in Den-
mark and
other places.
It was in the
former coun-
try he discov-
ered Mrs. Anderson, who, though American
by adoption, is Danish by birth.
Members of the Melbourne Music Club
made concertgoers at the Assembly Hall
acquainted with the latest works of Fritz
Hart by a presentation of “New Year's Eve”
and “Salve Caput Cruentatum,” choral work
for ladies’ voices with slight orchestration,
and a trio of Choral Preludes of Bach,
arranged for violin and piano. Mary and
Muriel Campbell’s efforts at publicity gath-
ered a full house. The Con. ladies’ choir,
with soloists Lilian Stott and Victoria An-
derson, in deb. frocking, raised pleasantly-
modulated voices, and the clever Fritz waved
his baton. He went, to tire piano for the
Bach selections played by violinist Ger-
trude Healy. Ivreisler and his wife were
guests. The fiddler, who has realised our
weakness for speeches, shed his topcoat
and faced tumultuous applause and a sea of
expectant faces in a business-like manner.
Guests were introduced, but were not per-
mitted to shake the hand that wields the
bow.
The hands of many Melbourne women
were extended in welcome to the Hon. Mrs.
Robert Lindsay and her daughters, Joyce,and.
Rosemary, who are on a visit to Australia.
Mrs. George Landale provided tea and buns
to music at her Toorak residence, where the
ballroom was all a-gleam with Iceland
poppies and narcissi. Mrs. George, who is
a sister of Mrs. Lindsay of the Clarke clan,
relieved a black ensemble suit with beige.
The guest of honor covered sable-toned gown-
ing with a wrap coat traced with beads and
gold thread, plus brown millinery. Daugh-
ter Joyce aired reseda satin and Paisley
inarocain, allied to an attuning headpiece.
Rosemary wore a black hat over blue velvet.
Of the invited were the Irvine and Chauvel
ladies. Mrs. Tom Grantham. Mrs. Alister
Clark. Mrs. IV. J. T. Clarke and Wilma
Clarke, Mrs. Reggie Clarke and heaps of
other folk likely to be seen any day enter-
ing the portals of the Alexandra Club.

Dr. Alan Waterhouse, of the. Apple Isle,
signed a permanent partnership with Dr.
Kathleen Daly at St. John’s, Camberwell,
the other day. The bride, who combines
brains and good looks, lias been a full-blown
medico only since April, 1928, when she
topped the honor list and shared the Fulton
Scholarship at the Melbourne Uni. Ivory
satin, crystal- and silver-beaded, with tulle
floating from a Juliet cap of orange buds,
formed her apparel. Dora and Beatrice, her
sisters, ’maided in apricot pink froeking and
toning tulle veils. Mr. and Mrs. {Arthur
Daly held the rejoicings at the Recreation
Hall, Kew.
The cables have brought news of the
marriage in London _ of Eleanor (Dora)
Watson, youngest chick of the late T.G.,
Clerk of Vic. Parliament, to Robert Wallace,
son of a late colonel. The bride’s dad was, as
Clerk of the Council from 1895 till his death
in 1912, the favorite Parliamentary officer
of the State. When Uncle Sam’s fleet was
in Melbourne IT years ago the Press dinner,
financed by the Bent Government, was orga-
nised by Watson, and was one of the most
memorable of the Melbourne functions.
That friendship and gratitude can sur-
vive the tomb was proved last week, when
the deeds of a villa at MacKinnon and a
cheque for £25 to help to furnish it were pre-
sented to Mrs. Allan Cameron by Vie. poli-
tical friends of her late husband, who was
M.L.A. for Dalhousie for nine years (1914-
23). Speaker Bowser did the presenting
at the State Parliament, and told the group
of subscribers who assembled that he had
no doubt they had borne in mind that the
dead member’s dad had also served in Par-
liament as member for Evelyn for 40 years,
lie gave a pat on the back to Everard, the
present member for Evelyn, for his organis-
ing work in helping to raise the £SOO-odd
which had paid for the home and a tomb-
stone, and then left the little surplus.
The Lyceum Club now boasts a suite of
rooms such as few feminine organisations
possess. They swagger across a whole
floor of the new additions to the Gothic
structure known as the E., S. and A. Bank
in Collins-street. Since its modest beginning
in 1910 the membership of the Lyceum lias
soared to over TOO feminine highbrow's. At
the housewarming recently, president Dr.
Georgina Sweet wms hostess, a happy inter-
val of the party being a presentation of a
purse of sovereigns to Miss Florence Byrne,
the club’s popular manager.
Newman College dance at St. Kilda Town
Hall was a jazz of joyous youth—nice young
men and pretty girls, the latter in the sweet-
est of wrappings. The college colors _of
cherry and navy blue were the decoration
scheme. Only one little pink-robed deb.,
Francie Nolan, from Echuca, was there to
take her initial dive into the social whirl-
pool. Reita Nugent was enjoying a night
off from the footlights, arrayed in gold lace
over old rose; and Eileen Starr, of the mel-
odious notes, had swathed her locks with
gold and red tissue above white attire.
The Norman FalkSners’ residence at South
Yarra was invaded the other afternoon by
the whirling dervislJtes of bridge, who played
for the glory and pitofit of the South Yarra
Melbourne Hospital .Auxiliary. To provide
against players taking any of their winnings
home, stalls were stocked with sweets, cakes
ami flowers. The prime movers of the card-
playing were Lady Mauds ley, chairwoman ;
Dorothy Mollinson, lion, secretary: and Mrs.
11. Maudsiey, who kept tally of the takings.
Mrs. S. M. llruce was of the tradespeople
pro tern.
Melbourne mourns a splendid philan-
thropist in tlie passing of one-time Chief-
Justice John Madden's widow. She was the
foundress of the Bush Nursing Association
and was interested in many hospitals and
charities. The date Frank Stephen, brother
of a former Chief Justice of N. S. Wales,
was her father.
The Kooyong CUthhouse sheltered the Vic.
Lawn Tennis Association dance, a happy,
informal affair. Between jazzes there was
a merry gathering around a cheerful log fire.
Frocks of every hue went: upoir their beaded
and crystal way, almost to a feminine patron:
and those who did not glisten glittered. Of
the beaded was Mrs. Frank Major, whose
gown was black; and Jean Morrell had pink
georgette traced with a floral design ; while
Mrs. Trenccy was an icicle with a crystal
fringe. Mr. John Koch secretaried the suc-
cessful hop.
Wedding bells rang at Scots’ Church.
Collins-street. for Anne, younger daughter of
the William Mcßeaths, of Toorak, and Dr.
John F. Williams, sou of Mrs. Williams,
also of Toorak. White satin with pointed
hem and train, all a-glisten with brilliants
and seed-pearls, was followed up the aisle by
sleeveless coats of silver lace, fur edged, and
hats of violet and silver tones wreathed
with pansies. Constance Mcßeath. Cecil
Belbridge. of Albury, and Lucie Williams
warmed the latter. The after-jollo filled the
Mcßeath domicile, where the hostess added
a sable wrap to black satin gowning, with
ospreyed hat, and the bridegroom’s mother
touched up black with leopard-skin.
At last the £25,000 given by ex-State
Treasurer William McPherson for a domestic
economy college is to be utilised bv the State.
A contract has been let at £37,484 for the
erection of the building' on portion of the
former Melbourne Gaol site, Itussell-strect.
In 37 months some interest has accumulated
on the 5 p.c. bonds handed over by McPher-
son. and the State will have to find only a
trifle over £lO,OOO. The col. is to he named
after the donor’s wife.
Miss Adelaide's budget:—-
The size and warmth of the Town Hall
meeting of protest, liurnedfv aicanged as
it was, should make the Government think
again about its Government House schemes.
Wisely the whole thing- was kept clear of party
politics and personalities, and even Lewis Cohen
tempered his usual emphasis with an unusual suavity.
Dr. John Corbin, with brilliant war service as a
medico to his credit, followed him, with Mrs. A. K.
Goode to voice the feminine view. The meeting was
practically unanimous—even J. C. Kield and M-cGann,
of the R.S.A., demanding to know what was to be
done about a war memorial, didn’t want the guber-
natorial residence moved—and was representative
enough to satisfy the most critical. Meanwhile the
wall has come down at a rate that a Government
job has never before achieved, the trees that once
shaded the hottest stretch of King William-road have
followed, and another day or two will see the
last of the old stables and out-buildings.
Ivy Phillips, who took herself and her contralto
voice to England some time ago, is at the moment
touring S’Africa with an English concert co. .
The Norwood School for Mothers has to thank the
Jazz Frolics for the proceeds of an excellent show
staged at the local Town Hall' the other evening.
These amateurs, with VVylton Todd as their director
and guide, give a show that should make professional
vaudeville blush under its carmine, and a good many
charities have had a financial leg-up through them.
What with Dorothea Spinney - , the State Orchestra
and the Con., the highbrows had it all their own way
this week. The Con. staged two concerts —one of
chamber music in the Liberal Hail, with Sylvia
Whitington. Kathleen Meegan, Charles SchiJsky ;aml
Harold Parsons as its exponents, and the other: by
the Students’ Orchestra in the Elder Hall. The
Students’ lot, by tlie way, is another of the things
we have to thank W. H. Foote for. He has done
wonders with it, as he has with the State Orchestra,
which gave a capital concert in the Town Hall.
Dr. Postle, who has been head of the Presbyterian
Girls’ College, is going to ped. on his own account
in Launceston (Tas.), where he has bought an
old-established school.
Twice this week two hostesses have circumvented
the High Cost of Jazzing by combining to give
dances —Mrs. Warden and Mrs. Britton Jones in
their mother’s house at the Grange; and Mrs. Willi.-
Aeraman and Mrs. Arthur Kaines at the Liberal Hall.
The latter, in a setting of lotus lilies, brasses and
eastern rugs, was mostly for the younger set, as one
of Mrs. Acraman’s two daughters still wears her hair
in beribboned plaits.

STOCKINGS
Valerie Braddon, only daughter of Dal-
gety’s chief, knight Henry, gave St. Mark's
at Darling Point its romantic thrill last
week. The old church looked its most digni-
fied against the clear cold night, and within
struck a note of subdued gaiety in a Wealth
of white blooms and banked greenery. The
stage being duly set, Valerie on father’s arm,
to a burst of choral music, kept her matri-
monial tryst with John D. Arnott, of Strath-
field. She passed demurely up the aisle
radiant in ivory crepe Romain, sprayed with
silver flowers and sparkling with what
appeared at first sight to the shivering on-
looker as hoar frost, but turned out to be
diamente. The sunrise had apparently been
robbed of the fluffy pearl and pink cloud that
did duty for a train, and a veil of Limerick
lace and an armful of such sweets as daphne
and violets finished off the perfect whole.
The four bridesmaids were a vivid splash of
color in their cornelian pink georgette frocks,
made with the newest knee flare, and apron
effects, and everything. Their heads were
swathed in gold tissue bands, to which were
moored the wisps of pink tulle that floated
off into shoulder scarfs. Bride’s
beckoned the guests later on to the Rose
Bay Golf Club, where the wedding-feast and
jazz met 'with the approval of all. The Brad-
don lady, incidentally, wore lilac and silver
frocking that deserves a special word. A
black hat with a sparkling crown and a
white fox wrap that trailed off into several
feet of black-and-white fringe were notable
addenda.
The party at the Royal Colonial Institute
had to do without its principal guests last
week because the American Admiral's lady,
her daughter and her niece were represented
by “regrets.” However, Mrs. Maclean, wife of
the Colorado’s chief, brought the aura of the
Stars and Stripes and the Empire heartbeat
of the Bligh-street stronghold together. The
Hugh Denison matron was Queen of the
frolic, and dressed the part in olive greens,
with sable for remembrance. Bertie .Kelly
kept the musical billy boiling, and had Gladys
Whybrow for one of his assistants. If
Gladys would drop the “r” from her name
what an arresting poster it would make!
Mrs. Robison, wife of the Admiral in
charge of the U.S.A. warships that will visit
Sydney, arrived last week by the Sonoma.
With her came Mrs. Baughman, Mrs. Wil-
liams, Mrs. Hooper and Mrs. Leigh, whose
husbands are all potentates in Uncle Sam’s
warboats. Mrs. Robison is a guest of Mrs.
Thornett at Summer Hill.
Singer Dorothy Helmricli, back among her
own people and quite unspoiled by success,
had the civic carpet of welcome spread tor
her midway through last week. Over white
fox furs Mayoress Cecilia Walsh crooned the
honors in a reception-room blazing with red
carnations and roses, the torrid temperature
thereof being cooled by a virginal mixture
of arum lilies. Dorothy arrived in an artful
frock suggestive of golden sands patterned
with dark-brown seaweed; her turban, in the
same shades, flew a pair of golden wings. A
posy of pink carnations and violets was
thrust upon her, together with many words
as sweet to the ear as honeycomb to the
teeth. Mother and sister Mrs. Piddington
smiled proudly over the success of the family
baby, and old teacher Will Beattie basked
in the glow. Sydney’s musical peerage
turned up in force, Town-clerk Layton mel-
lowing the gathering with his well-tailored
suavity.
Dorothy Helmrich has been the centre of
quite a flurry of social activities during the
week. At one reception the singing girl made
her first flight into oratory with a flawless
speech of five minutes’ length. This was
duly caught in the wireless and hurtled
broadcast over the continent. The third
day after her return Dorothy was bidden to
a dish of tea with Lady de Chair. To meet
her were the wives of the Great of the visit-
ing Navy who, like sailors’ wives the world
over, are waiting the tide that brings their
lords home again.
Historic King’s School held a rally at the
Wentworth last week, and Old Boys from
the outermost borders of the State swung
an active foot in the dance or reminisced
cheerily. Grey and scarlet gave a swash-
buckling air to the gathering, but the wear-
ers proved to be the present-day seniors, who
still labor under the bloom of youth. Beauti-
fully-frocked young things, in plaits and
bobs and shingles, were there in shoals to
partner the boys; and the school's blue and
white, mingled with bowls of gaily-hued Ice-
land poppies, put a further splash of color
on the jocund night. Headmaster-padre
E. M. Baker and his graceful wife came in
a. quite unofficial capacity, and were the
guests of the David Maughan couple. The
other big public schools sent ambassadors,
who were the guests of the very efficient
committee. N. Walters and J. Houston were
the evening’s secretaries, and W. Friend
and B. B. O’Conor kept an eye on the box-
office.
The little Playbox Theatre had a very
grand audience for its second performance of
“R.U.R.” The nice Consul for Czecho-
slovakia, who looks like a Michael Aden
hero, was a front-seater and brought a party;
also he made a speech during an unduly pro-
longed interval. The bandbox of a theatre was
crammed so tight that there literally wasn’t
foothold for a late-comer. Ernest Watt and
Sydney Ure Smith were among the early-door
arrivals; a highbrow visitor from Oxford and
a layer of the local Higher Education had
seats of vantage; Tenor Alfred O’Shea
looked in, and Duncan Macdougall’s beam-
ing wife kept the door. A completely happy
gathering, except that poor Dorothea Mae-
kellar was absent from the cast owing to
her father’s illness.
The Painter-Etchers’ show swung smoothly
open after Sir Dudley de Chair had
applied a neat combination of words to
its official lock. Syd Dong, who knows all
about Governors, having been chummy with
the species since boyhood (he began as far
back as the Beauchamps), took charge of
his Ex. and talked himself hoarse pointing
out the good work of the other fellow\ The
Viking's daughter, who kept them company,
smiled even when details slipped into the
technical; afterwards there was tea in the
alcove, where the Brangwyns hang. The
prices of the etchings in this show are mod-
erate. Some delightful bits can be had for
three or four guineas.
Midway through last week the young
things of Dattilo Rtibbo’s studio sat about
on its Batik- and chintz-covered benches and
listened raptly while Barclay Godson told
them the way of an etching, from the pre-
paration of the copper-plate to the last twist
of the press. Of line, aquatint, mezzo-tint
and steel engraving Mr. Barclay discoursed
so simply and lucidly that if this Letter
could only draw it would now be the com-
plete etcher. Major Arnott was in the chair,
and Dattilo Itubbo kept the atmosphere
vibrating. By the way, one of the best
things that have evolved from the art students
of the State is their little typewritten paper,
Undergrowth, which is just two issues
on its way to become a rival of Art in Aus-
tralia.
When you see a lady wearing across her
shoulder a skin of golden brown fur that
looks and feels like plush, you’ll know she
is Ida Dawson, whose picture is alongside,
and that the skin once housed a bulleau of
Patagonia. Ida, the first white woman to
cross the
Andes, is In
Sydney for a
hying visit
to her family.
Southern Pat
ago n i a has
been her ad-
dress for the
last five years.
There her
brother is dug-
in as estancia
(station) man-
ager for one of
the Argentine
cattle kings.
When Ida
(her father
was for years
stock inspector
at Goulburn)
first went out
housekeeping
for her brother
their estancia was pitched on a tableland
set between fathomless seas of green—the
forest canons of the Andes—and the glitter-
ing, opal-tinted glories of the mountain peaks.
Around the station colony the wind blew
ceaselessly; at night it sounded like the suit
at Bondi. Even in midsummer it was never
warmer than our winter days. Timber was
so scarce that fuel had to be brought leagues
in the wooden springless carts that are still
the principal transport in a district whoso
only roads are mule-tracks. So lots of nights
the Australian rejoiced that she was of
Goulburn, where the winds breed you hard.
A move down into the valleys in the
middle of the Andes brought comparative
thawing and a chance to wear evening frocks
when one gave a party. That is not often
when there is only one w r ay of entering or
leaving the mountain fastness where your
host lives, i.e:, by mule. Everybody hunts,
and the daily bag is made up of miniature
deer and the guanaco, a sort of small brother
to the llama. Running a home is not much
trouble, for any amount of labor is ready
at hand. Although the maids (mostly half-
breed Indians) arc bush-shy at first, and
view such strange contraptions as a bed, a
carpet and a gramophone with amazement
and awe, they soon become almost blasA In
less than three months they have exchanged
the long trailing skirt and blouse which was
their wardrobe on arrival for the last-
minute ParisrPatagouian style. They can
copy anything, and pay-day means a run
on the station store s stock of vivid materials.
Even the hairdressing changes with the
quickness of a conjuring trick. When the
newest house parlormaid arrives, she we.acs
her locks in a jungle of tiny little plaits
all over her head: but the next time you
look at her, a fashionably-dressed head, such
as adorned the front of that mail-order cata-
logue you threw in the waste-paper basket,
meets your gaze. IThe shingle and the
straight-front figure haven’t yet been heard •
of in Patagonia. When they are, the local
belles will have a terrible time, for now fat is
beauty.

Two small-size dances and a garden party
are the Government House fixtures for the
entertainment of the visiting Fleet. The
American colony’s own welcome on the night
of the 23rd, the ball on the Naldera on the
25th, Mrs. Dan Kelly's ball at her Kirri-
billi home on the same date, a tattoo and
a hunt, the last two arranged by the Vic
toria Barracks, are a few other social acti-
vities in the week that treads on the heels
of the Dudley Cup flutter.
Even a wind with a razor-like edge could
not keep the surging hundreds away from
the Catholic Ball at the Palais last week.
One limousine got the shock of its life wheu
it pulled up at its Moore Park rendezvous,
and that was the car of Archbishop Kelly.
It positively blushed into its bonnet. But
the Church's head dignitary was there prin-
cipally to usher the little debs, across the
social threshold. Very prettily too the string
of white-frocked and -posied youngsters
dropped their bob to his Grace, who kissed
his ring and retired down the avenue of red
carpet. The frocks at the ball were both
rich and beautiful, though they were only
seen when the w.earers were in action. In
between dances everybody shrunk inside
wraps and gathered about the radiators of
the family box.
William Heughau brought his perfect pro-
file and his nice taste in kilts back to Sydney
Town Hall last week, and for two
nights delighted a real heather-mixture
audience with the songs of Scotland.
Heughan is clever at pantomime; with a
twist of the face and a movement of the hand
he can be a perfect imitation of the canny
old man off to market, or the cocksure young
laird going a-eourting. When he struck up
“Auld ,Lang Syne” he insisted on the audi-
ence not only joining in but joining hands.
And, really, when the two good-looking High-
landers (there’s an even more handsome
brother who wears a kilt with a devastating
grace) urge them on, the fur-coated woman
and her neighbor of the woolly scarf clasp
hands for a few glad moments in which all
differences lie drowned.
_ Viola Ferguson, now of Woollahra and one
time of Goulburn, has joined the ranks of the
trousseau collectors. The male reason for
her research work is A. E. L. James, of
Miles (Q.) and of Summer Hill.
Miss Esther Chandler, who retired a few
weeks ago amid showers of bouquets from the
Director of Education down to the youugiest
assistant, was one of the most diffident of
women teachers. “You tell Miss Chandler,”
said a former chief inspector, “to blow her
trumpet more loudly. It sounds true!” After
50 years’ service Miss Chandler is still
awaiting confirmation of her original appoint-
ment. Rejected by old Dr. McKenzie owing
to lack of inches, she simply went on teach-
ing. She was called upon to appear before
William Wilkins, and was also inspected by
Mr. Alfred Stephen. Interested in her re-
plies to questions, they told her to expect a
letter of appointment in a few days. To this
day the letter has not arrived. But Miss
Chandler did.
The most interesting number on the Ruth
Ladd programme at the Con. last week was
Percy Grainger’s “Colonial Song." The
music is at once melodious and stirring, but
instead of words there are just meaningless
vowel and consonant sounds —perhaps a
gentle hint by the composer that he con-
siders Australia inarticulate. Frank Hut-
chens, violinist Dan Scully and accompanist
Vern Barnett helped to make the Melbourne
girl's recital worth remembering.
The Arthur Morts of Ffanklyu Vale,
Queensland, decided on All Saints’, Wool-
lahra, for daughter Mary Franklyn's wed-
ding to Dr. Nat Barton; of Wellington
(N.S.W.). A bishop and two canons —his
Archgaiters of Bathurst}, Canon Langley
and Canon Mort, an uncle of the bride—saw
that the noose was properly adjusted. The
bride, in a thistledown confection of ivory
georgette and diamente ballasted by a lush
growth of pearl and crystal fringe, was
squired by her father to the altar rails, and
her train of Spanish lace Avas guarded by
two tiny nieces, Mary and Barbara McCon-
nel. In addition, there were three grown-up
’maids, Gwen McGregor, Kitty Joske and
Margaret Walsh, and the whole retinue was
euswathed in the softness of ivory lace. lan

amid the correctness of the Queen’s Club,

Sydney’s Best and Almost Good Enough
arc getting thrilled already over the Dudley
Cup Ball on the 21st. The takings have quite
an aristocratic objective—they arc to help
towards the new polo grounds that enthusi-
asts are planning. The G.-G. Forsters are
“patronising" the function, at which their
State Exes, will be present. Nicholson's
have the box-plan, and Mrs. Din Garvan is
the secretary, with the attractive Mrs. Wol-
ford as energetic First Loot.
Genevieve Taylor, youngest daughter of J.
M. Taylor, of North Sydney—the man who
refused to resign from the Public Service
Board a few years ago—is engaged to Cecil
Murphy, the Labor member for the
district. Genevieve, a pretty, dark girl, has
inherited old J.M.’s smile, which is embrac-
ing and benevolent. Her eldest sister married
Captain Duhig, a nephew of Archbishop
Duhig. They are nieces of George Crowley,
the veteran of the Mutual Life.
The friends of the Hospice for the Dying
are once more rallying to the assistance of
the Darlinghurst institution. A ball at the
Palais on August 3 has been organised with
a view to replenishing the coffers that are
never locked against the cry of need.
Mayoress Cecilia Walsh is president of the
committee; and the State Exes, have pro-
mised the light of their presence.
A brief note from Brisbane: —
Passed over suddenly, Mrs. Lumley Hill, whose
racing colors were carried by a number of good
horses, She had a noble eye for stock, and her
station, Bellevue, in Coominya district, where she
entertained General Pau, ran many a fine beast.
Gloria Hughes, in pink georgette over satin, took
Geoffrey Annand, of the Lieutenant-Colonel Annand
family, for better or worse in St. Andrew’s Church
the other day. The bride is the only daughter ox
the late W. B. Hughes of Glenprarie station. The
Rev. Scott Macdonald tied the knot, with Dailey
Scarlett at the organ. Jean Annand and Doris
Kemp ’maided in blue; and Thompson Annand
best-manned. The feasting was at Finney’s.
The Press Institute poured tea for the Allan
Wilkies’ week, and there were many verbal bouquets
thrown about. The throng included Mrs. White
(Sydney), the Sligoes, the Percy Reays, the Readings,
M. Forrest, P. J. Leahy and other penpushers.
Although Brisbane is not usually keen on drama,
Guy Bates Post as the Masquerader has been at home
to good houses at His Majesty’s. A civic recep-
tion was given to the American in the Town Hall, at
which Allan Wilkie spoke in praise of his fellow
mummer.
Tessa Reading is back from Westralia, where she
has been visiting her brother-in-law, who looks after
the Carnegie observation post on the edge of the
Great Beyond.
Iceland poppies and bignonia venusta made a glow-
ing background for the winter frocking frieze at
Ascot races. Sir Matthew had General Douglas
with him, and brewed a pot of tea for the Whitting-
hams, the Glyn Connollys, J. J. Powers, Irma
Dearden, Elfrida Walsh and Garth Ehvyn.
Brisbane’s Mayoress Barry called a crowd to
Lennon’s to welcome sculptress Daphne Mayor. Brown
bowls and baskets of wattle decorated the ballroom,
and presentation bouquets filled the arms of the
guest of honor, who murmured thanks in navy and
a black hat anu furs. Mrs. Premier Gillies and
Mrs. Tom Ryan were amongst the bidden.
Mrs. Parke Pope of Sydney lunched some pals at
the Bellevue, amidst scarlet poinsettia and orange
bignonia. Mrs, A. D. Walsh and Mrs. A. B. Carvosso
helped to pick the chicken.
Percy Wilmot Milner, who took Elsa Valentine
Young for keeps at St. Andrew’s Presbyterian Ivirlc
the other day, is a nephew of late newspaper
potentate Northcliffe.

SPORTING
NOTIONS
“Hasen”: Jumping at Flemington, as at
Randwick, becomes more and more a sort of Roman
holiday affair. Seven of the 13 starters fell in the
G. N. Steeple (one was remounted), and three of the
five in the Footscray Steeple. But perhaps the number
and variety of falls are considered added attractions,
something really exciting for our 13s. 6d. That
seems to be the attitude of one Melbourne paper
which, after recalling that three-quarters of the field
fell in the Trial Steeple of 1924, suggested gleefully
that there would' be “plenty of thrills” in the 1925
event of that name. There were, though probably
not enough for the real connoisseur of “thrills.” Of
a field of 12, five completed the course safely. The
sort of sportsman who
finds his thrill in such
affairs must have licked
his lips, though, at
the sight of Yarragon,
the poor brute that fell
at the first fence in
the Keilor Hurdle, then
chased the field up the
straight with one leg
bmken and flailing
wildly, and actually
jumped a hurdle on
three legs.
MICK RASHEED.
His colors arc
well known on
S. Aus. and West-
ralian courses.
Although there had been rain, with more
expected, the crowd that saw Tommy Butler land
the G. N. Steeple on Dundalk was an improvement
on the attendance of a week before, when Tommy
triumphed on Pildin in the G. N. Hurdle. Having
during the week beaten a lot of other ’chasers on
the flat, Dundalk firmed immediately from 10’s to
s’s, and finished favorite on the course at 7 to 2.
As a result, Haoma, 3’s early, went out to 4’s and
Palbi to 0 to 2, King High being at 7’s and Mon-
rose at 10’s. Haoma was in front at the treble
the fjrst time round. Dundalk hit the second of
this row and Butler was looking over his mount’s
head for a fateful second or so; by good luck his
foot caught in the saddle and he was bumped back.
Haoma looked to be going easily in front six fur-
longs from home, but down he came at the second
of the abattoirs treble, old Monrose having fallen
at the previous fence and broken his neck. This
left Palbi in charge, but Dundalk soon passed him
and entered the straight with a good lead and
the race won. He finished six lengths ahead of the
outsider Mailman, who outstayed Palbi in the
run home. King High, Red Mac, Governor Gay
and Resembler were the only others to struggle
past the judge’s box. Bred in South Aus., by
Pistol —Poise, Dundalk won the last Onkaparinga
Steeple and afterwards ran two solid races at Flem-
ington and AVilliamstown. Stan Reid, Mountain
God’s old pilot, trains the ordinary-looking gelding
for S. Myers. Another S. Aus. horse in Sandridge
(3’s) annexed the Footscray Steeple, being left in
front after Welcome Stranger, Dorney and Strath
Blith had fallen. He had only to beat the un-
ready Sir Wilson, and he did it by two lengths.
■Nicely handled by young Ryan, Parupa (s’s) eaught
Fiscom at the last obstacle in the £lOOO Doutta
Galla Hurdle and cleared away from Fail-land (4’s)
and Berrinbo (5 to 2) at the end. This taking
customer has lost. 3lb. in the Australian Hurdle,
and will figure in many Hurdle-awl-Steeple doubles.
Valiant, who ran a close fourth in the Doncaster,
won the July Handicap, at r s’s, for F. E. Shillabeer.

“Hamer”: Harry Harrison was so sickly
at the age <of 23 that he had to abandon his job as
a compositor; and it was then that he took up work
as a horse-trainer. He was 70 when he died the
other day. His father was a great founder of papers,
the Geelong Advertiser and the WatrnaWi-
Ibool Advertiser among them. The son trained
.a heap of winners for the Manifold family, 'first
■coming into prominence when Apsley Tan away with
the Grand National Hurdle in 1804 ; but Mountain
God was the best horse he ever saddled Up. Mountain
God won the G. N. Steeple with list. Mb. In 1921

The V.R.C, is making its members pay
more for their privileges. The entrance fee has been
raised from 30 guineas to 4'o guineas, and the
yearly subscription goes up -50 p.c.—from six to nine
guineas. It is within the power of Chief-Sec. Argyle
to disallow the by-law in which the new fees are
embodied, but he is not likely to exercise it.

W. Kelso, who is completing a very suc-
cessful year, has effected a great improvement in
the three-year-old Red Gauntlet, by Malt King—
Sundream. An upstanding chestnut, Red Gauntlet
!had lOst. 31b. in the second division of the Flying
Welter at Moorefield, and, if Pike had been wilding,
■could have won by a lot more than the head that
separated him from the smart Chateau Tanunda. Seven
to two was the chestnut’s price (it was his second
success in nine days) and 7st. 10lb. is his weight
in the Epsom Handicap, in which he has more than
an outside chance. Carmray (Rouvray—Carmia)
showed surprising speed at the right end of the
Moorefield Handicap, 10 furlongs, considering that
he will be 12 on August 1. He went much too
fast for Farceur, Automatical and eight others. The
ancient was favorite at 9 to 4.
* * * *
“FY7”: An Adelaide greyhound is the
latest to figure in the limelight of a doping
scandal. His mouth was swabbed and the vet. reported
traces of arsenic, whereupon the stewards handed out
a packet of disqualifications ranging from 10 years to
18 months. These little refinements in the gentle
art of stopping a dog are no doubt necessary in
the enclosed coursing grounds of Australia. At
Waterloo, Lancashire, where the famous Cup is run,
and at other well-known coursing grounds on British
downs, our rude forefathers resorted to methods no
less efficacious, if more direct. There is a classical
instance of a leader who was squared to stiffen the
favorite in a semi-final of a Waterloo Cup in the
’sixties. This he did by feeding the ravenous tyke
with several pounds of steak which he had concealed
in his coat-pocket. When the dog was put in the
slips with his rival, on whom all the me n-y was
going, he felt he had made a mistake and surrendered
his breakfast. The other dog, profiting by the
fact that the attention of the humans was centred
on another course in progress, gratefully swallowed
it, with disastrous results to his backers.
“The Deacon”: The next world’s champion
sculler may be a German. Ernest Barry, the greatest
oarsman Britain has produced, has gone out to Halle,
in Germany, as rowing instructor to the young sports
there. One would th'nk that there would have been
little difficulty in England about retaining the services
of the man who beat Paddon, but Germany, recog-
nising his ability, secured him without any difficulty
or protest from the English rowing fraternity.

“Hamer”: For winning the professional
golf competition at Sandringham (Vic.),Tcm Howard
collected £5OO and a medal; but he earned it In
four days he had to play 143 "holes and made 570
strokes in doing it. traversing 30 miles. Tom climbed
into the semi finds by a spectacular victory over
"Happy” Eyre, who gave him heaps of trouble.
Howard was brilliant in the semi-final, in which he
defeated Rowley-Banks; and, matched against the
steady Spicer -in the final, he won 3 up and 2 to
play. In the first knock-out round, Eyre eliminated
Arthur le Fevre, sometime open champion ; and 1).
G. Soutar and Fred Popplewell were among the
casualties in the next round. It was a competition
full of surprises, and the noise of youth knocking at
the door was almost deafening.
"H. Hardupp”: Howai-d is rising 37. He was
for 14 years a clerk in the N.S.W. Railway Depart-
ment, and was in the Education Department before
that. The golf bug got him when he was 23, and
six weeks after joining a club he was runner-up in
the State championship. He won a pile of amateur
prizes and titles and last year annexed the N.S.W.
professional title; he has been a pro. for three
years. One of his two sons caddied for him in
the Sandringham match.

Tenarlo Pelkey (9st. 121 b.), the sullen-
looking Filipino welterweight, punched a hole in
his manners when he discovered, at Sydney Stadium,
that he could not beat Era Baxter (9st. 9flb.) in a
round or two. Surprised and hurt by the white man’s
tearing lefts, Pelkey resorted to Haymarket rules. He
was reproved several times by the referee, and more
than once he earned disqualification, but it didn’t
arrive. In the second round he split Baxter’s right
eyebrow with a butt, and thereafter he palmed and
pawed and scrubbed the wound with his mat of
hair. By such means he kept it constantly open,
the stream of blood partially blinding the white
man throughout. Even with this heavy handicap,
Baxter, who showed great improvement on his
previous Sydney form, proved a doughty opponent,
and frequently knocked Pelkey out of his stride by
hard straight rights or lefts to the head and body;
while twice he more than held his own in a desperate
rally. But Ernie presented such a gory spectacle, and
was so obviously tiring, that referee Joe Wallis, after
putting the question at the end of the 11th, exercised
his option in the 12th tohrid and crowned Tenario.
The crowd angrily hooted the winner.
"ft&ttelr”: The stranger in the Stadium
Hrtg had evidently learned his boxing from a pugs.’
fashion journal. His stance was beautiful, and
nothing could be more elegant than the way in
which he led off with his right, crossed with .ms
left and clinched; but unfortunately the only thipjg
the stylist could score a hit with 'Vis nis face, fVitn
which he battered his opponent’s igloVgS Unmercifully.
Still, punishment did hit elite him of,the idea that
he was doing the. right thing, and his boxing was in
its own way as ihhhacdlate as, Bruce’s spats. Pre-
sently the path'OS of the. thing touched the heart of
someone in the hob 'seats. “Throw in the towel,
Wia%e’!” the sympathiser shouted. “You ain’t a
foghthr—yoh’re 'oti’y an optimist!”
Walter Miller (list. 1111 b.) and Al.
Katesick (list. 121 b.) have had another of their
grappling duels at the Melbourne Stadium, without
intervals between rounds this time. Karasick did
a lot of acrobatic work in his eager search for
head-holds, but Miller evaded in his eel-like way
till he saw an opening; then, bringing tremendous
pressure to bear with a double wristlock and double-
arm scissors, he soon had Karasick in dire straits.
Referee Bridges asked Karasick whether he con-
ceded the fall, and the man’s “Yes” sounded like
BENNY WEARING, the Ma State's best
winger.
a dying squeak. He came back vigorously enough,
and with a series of headlocks punished Miller so
badly that the American, with one arm in danger
of being fractured, signified that that particular
bout had lasted long enough. Miller got the third
and deciding fall in a brainy fashion. Karasick,
making one of his dives for a headlock, missed and
fell sideways. Miller fell upon him, turned him on
his back, and pegged away until both shoulders
were on the mat.
Memories of previous M.L. League teams
kept many people away from the Sydney C. G. on
Saturday, but it is estimated that 22,000 witnessed
the first N.S.W.-Maoriland match. They soon learned
that League football has greatly improved beyond the
Tasman, and was general agreement that the
Maorilanders were unlucky in being beatin by 7 points
to 4. During most of the time they had much the
better of the play ; in the second half the ball was
only four times near the Black goal-line. With a.
bit better handling in the final passing rushes, the
visitors would have been a hatful of points to the
good after the hard game. They have a very good
pack, and Mouatt, Henery and Ellis (all six-
footers) were conspicuous ; their flashes of dribbling
often baffled opponents. Weatherali (five-eighth),
Brown (a fast winger who kept Wearing quiet) and
G. Dufty (full-back), also played finely; in fact,
Dufty was the best man on the field. For N.S.W.,
Rule and O’Rourke (centre three-quarters) were the
outstanding pair, O’Rourke’s try—the only one of
the match—being very clever. Latta and O’Connor
did a lot of heavy work; they had to, for Justice,
the hooker, gave them little assistance.
* * * *
The third Soccer Test match, played at
Maitland (N.S.W.). ended in another win for England,
scores being 8 goals to 2. Such a runaway victory
was not anticipated, for Australia fielded her best
team to date. Masters and Thompson, from the
South Coast, were again in the forward line, the
argument which kept the pair out of the last Test
having been dropped for the time being. England, oil
the other hand, was weakened by injuries to some of
her cracks, two of her three backs having to stand
down. The game was another triumph for the
English combination ; the forward and half-back line
displayed perfect un lerstanding and time and again
left the Australian forwards standing. Batten, who
netted five of the winners’ eight goals, outplayed
Masters at centre. The fourth Test in Sydney next
Saturday and the last in Melbourne the following
week should provide opportunity, now the series
has been captured by England, of trying out some
new' men. The tourists’ score sheet shows the
staggering tally of 112 goals to 9, they having
defeated Newcastle in a mid-week match by 3—o.
* * * *
Cold, wet weather spoilt Melbourne’s
League gates on Saturday, though the chief show,
between Melbourne and Essendon, brought a 25,000
crowd. The ancient club has regained some of its
former glory this season, and on Saturday delivered
the goods with emphasis. Faster and better organised,
the Red Legs gave the ’Dons no encouragement from
the start, and finally outed them with 55 points to
38. Geelong, unbeaten this season save for its
initial and unaccountable licking by North Mel-
bourne, was at home to South Melbourne, and, having
got its old cmmv down, avenged many defeats with
a bit to spare. When, at the end of the first quarter,
the board showed Geelong 70 points, South 0, the latter’s
barrackers departed en masse in search of lemonade
and other pick-me-ups. At the close, the horrible
record ran: Geelong 121 points, South 28. Fitzroy
also piled up a mountain of points against Hawthorn
—125 to 41 ; and Collingwood notched 106 to
Footscray’s 62. St. Kilda managed, by a., last-
quarter outburst, to overcome Carlton. with 65
points to 40, and the Richmond Tigers shunted North
Melbourne into outer darkness, with 60 points to
North’s 51.

“tiiprk'’: Tli'ey take their football seriously
ih Ballarat as well as Melbourne (B. 2/7/’25).
The South Ballarat club, having gone down before
Golden Point in a recent match, protested on the
ground that Point had played a leather-chaser who
resided outside the club radius. After solemn de-
liberation, the League officials dismissed the objection,
but the indignant South Ballarat delegates supported
a second protest with an imposing pile of plans,
maps, photographs of mile posts, official drawings,
municipal engineers’ declarations and land officers’
certificates. For three solid hours the League
officials held their aching heads while the rival
delegates thundered. In the end it was decided that
official information as to the distance by air from
the Ballarat P.O. to Wilkinson’s domicile should
be sought by the League from the Lands Department,
but there is a strong feeling in Ballarat that Parlia-
ment should appoint a Royal Commission.

“FY7”: Rugby Union players nowadays
are running terribly to swank. They get ss. a day
amateur allowance, and play at the most three
matches in eight days, when on tour, with three
clear days before a Test. I notice that the M.L.
Union, while arranging preliminaries for the Ma
Staters’ tour next month, turned down a Sydney
request for a touring party of 29 players, a
manager and a “baggage man,” though it con-
sented to 26 players, a manager and a secretary.
Time was when a side of 18 or 20 players, one of
whom was a manager, could tour M.L. and win
matches, too. Their allowance was what they could
provide themselves. As for baggage, we have the
precedent of one famous player of the ’nineties who
arrived cn board ship with a bundle in a red hand-
kerchief. When he was shown his cabin, the
steward asked where his baggage was. “Baggage?”
said he. “Why, it’s ’ere in this bundle.”
# * * *
“Tren”: Just-deceased W. W. * biggin
helped to make Victorian cricket history. Open-
ing batsman for Bast Melbourne in the ’sixties and
’seventies, he played a prominent part in the
lost-ball match between Bast and South Melbourne
'.in ’7l. Ford (S.M.) hit a ball to leg. It hopped the
t.wo-rail fence, and Goldsmith, in trying to hop after
it, struck hard and fell dazed. So eager were the
fieldsmen to render first aid that the ball lay un-
heeded on the road. There were no boundaries then,
so Gagg., cool and shrewd. Called “lost ball” when
five had been run, and limited the hit to six. Bast
won by two runs, and a long and strong argument
commenced in the newspapers between the rival cap-
tains. The first contention of Dick Ward ill. of
South, that eight had been run before “lost ball”
was called was never proved, and his seech 1, that
as the ball was always in sight the call should neither
have been made nor allowed, gained him only sym-
pathy. So this most famous of Vic. club matches
remained to the credit of the Jolimonters. Old Gagg.
had a distinguished career in the State public
service.
*#* , *
“Shrewsbury” In spite of the Oassandfas
of the English sporting press, who have been wonder-
ing where the country could get an eleven of Gents,
fit to compete with the Players, the despised Mistahs
handsomely wen the first match at Lords.- With Tate.
Hobbs, Heame and other cracks against them, the
Gents, did splendidly to get 485, Tate taking 7 for
148. The pros, declared in both innings, with 8 for
403 and 7 for 252 (Hobbs 51, Heariie 65), and their
opponents made the required mils for the loss of
six wickets. Bettington, of -N.SfW.j wiio was chosen
for the Gents., did nothing startling With bat or ball,
but G. O. Allen, of Melbourne and Cambridge, got
130 in his side’s first knock.
* * * *
Opposing players are milch more likely to
be better judges of a cricketer's capacity thail armchair
(or grandstand) critics, and soiiie of Herbert Sut-
cliffe’s impressions of the younger Australian players
he saw in action last season (London DailA Chkon-
ictK 20/5/’25) are full of interest, none the less
because one or two of those evidently regarded by
him as probabies for the next English trip are
hardly yet placed in that category here. “Pohsford's
batting was one of the prime features Of our toiir,
but on the perfect Australian wickets he can plat
to the pitch of the bail and punch it through the
covers without risk, whereas in England the baii
lias to be watched right up to the face of the bat.
Victor Richardson has flic real Test match tem-
perament; I doubt if a better three-fienre irtnittgs
was scored by anybody during the recent series, aild
he has few superiors as a captain.... Arthur
Richardson is a rapid scorer, and his fierce attacking
powers might easily make him invaluable if he should
take full advantage of our English wickets,... KippaX
scores all round the wicket; his best strokes are
reminiscent of Trumper.... Woodfull was Very unfor-
tunate in not being given a chance in the Test
series. His defence is extraordinarily sound; if ho
comes to England, where the ball has to be watched
so closely, he will not be far from the top of the
batting averages in the end.... One of the most
promising players in Australia is J. W. Rymill; his
wrist-work and his perfect timing make file ball
leave the bat at a terrific speed. He plaved a most
brilliant knock against us.” From other eulogistic
references to South Australian cricket one infers
that Sutcliffe won’t be surprised if N.S.W. and
Victoria cease to have it all their own way in
Sheffield Shield matches this year. It may be better
for cricket if they den't, even if the selectors of flic
1926 team for England get more headaches in conse-
quence.

“Tammas”: A Perth Jewish cricket team
did well during the past season in open competition
with its Gentile friends, coming third in an Associa-
tion of eight clubs. It is now devoting its attention
to Soccer, which game is played almost exclusively
in Palestine, where most of the team first, saw flic
light. Apropos of the Jew’s aptitude for sport,
Suzanne Lenglen belongs to the Chosen Race, as also
do Abrahams, winner of the 100 metres at the
Olympic Games; Benny Leonard, Kid Lewis and
Bloomfield, the boxers; and Karasick, the wrestler.
Australian Jews prominent in sport are Coppleson the
swimmer, Asher the “bosie” bowler, and the Cohens,
great smiters for the late Sydney first-grade club.
HER FANCY.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
“Young Lady like to meet young Man in racing
line; view above. Valda,” — Age matrimonial ad.
He must be in the racing line,
The bloke round whom her arms would twine
In passion fierce or pensive.
The damsel needs a turfy beau
His handkerchief her way to throw.
The field that’s indicated so
Is fairly comprehensive.
An owner, I surmise, would do,
Or one who bellows 5 to 2
Where bulging bags are carried.
A jock, ’tis clear, more ice would cut
Than any non-equestrian knut ;
A trainer might suffice her, but
They’re almost always married.
A really soulful “after dark”
Might prove the quite ideal spark
In whom she yearns to merge her
Lone maiden lot. But how about
A stable lad? A clocking tout?
A cove who ticktacks odds about?
A whisperer? An urger?
A sporting prophet? Who denies
That each or any such complies
With all the acl.’s essentials?
A chap whom nothing else equips
To sip the honey from her lips
Might trot along his weekly tips
To serve him as credentials.
Ah, lady, may you find a fine
Prince Charming “in the racing line”
For union beatific!
But there are such a vast of queer
Potential mates within the sphere
1 think you ought to be, my dear,
A trifle more specific.

“X2X”: It is likely that before long there
will be a considerable demand for a new
drug known as caapiu, recently discovered
by an American phai’maeologist in Central
South America. The glucosidal active prin-
ciple of a root-plant, known botanically as
Caapi banisteria, it belongs to a natural
order not unlike that which gives us strych-
nine, and possesses stimulating properties, both
mental and physical, greater than those pos-
sessed by cocaine. On the other hand, it
has no harmful qualities when taken in
moderate doses, and is not a habit-forming
drug. Its chief medicinal use is said to be
in cases of sudden collapse and syncope, and
it is likely to be found valuable in the treat
ment of certain forms of heart disease. In
addition it may prove an antidote for the
drug-habit, one medical man having reported
that when it was administered in place of
morphine it removed the depression caused
by the withdrawal of that drug. As a re-
viver after a hectic night it holds out great
promise.
“Sixenato” : Some unusual romantic senti-
ment was outlined—albeit the Court refused
to listen to the full details —in a recent Mel
bourne divorce case. Some years ago a
woman who had been shamefully treated by
her husband made a slip which landed her
in the Divorce Court as a respondent. The
co-re. failed to “do the right thing,” and the
woman, with the two children her husband
had left on her hands, was practically desti-
tute. Then a good-hearted and elderly bache-
lor, who had been an intimate friend of the
lady’s father, came on the scene, and re-
claimed her from the ranks of the socially
outcast by marrying her. The marriage was
de jure, not de jacto, the man being content
with giving his name to his old pal’s daugh-
ter. Orthodox romance would probably in-
sist that the girl learnt to love her bene-
factor ; but she didn’t. Someone else came
along, and the older man completed his sacri-
fice on the altar of friendship by furnishing
his legal partner with the evidence that has
enabled her to get a divorce and marry the
late-coming Mr. Right.
Herbert Macdowell, formerly chief clerk
of the Chief Sec.’s Department in Victoria,
who has released his grip on life, will be
missed by a group of boon companions upon
whom he played countless pranks. As a
trustee of Caulfield racecourse he went for
a stroll one evening, accompanied by his
Irish terrier. “I saw.” he said, “several
colors not registered by the V.R.C., and found
they were sported by Arch. Mannix and
others who were joining in an open-air fete
in aid of Catholic schools or something.”
Thinking he would like to hear Dr. Mannix,
Macdowell pushed his way into the throng.
No sooner did the terrier catch the roll of
the episcopal oratory than he growled like
an angry Ulsterman. There was a move
to silence the dog, when Macdowell said, in
an admonishing tone: “Be quiet, Pat; have
some manners.” To ill-treat an Irish terrier
named Pat was the last thing such a crowd
would dream of doing; and the dog, whose
real name was understood to be Horace,
was allowed to do just as he pleased.
“H.E.” V : Usually my only dealings with
the mighty Water Board are those of a
humble vassal who periodically brings
his inadequate tithe to his lord. But
the other day accident gave me a
chance to assert myself, if only anony-
mously. Having removed my mud-caked
ploughing boots, I was praying earn-
estly that the baby would not wake before
the goodwife had lunch ready, when the
telephone-bell, always a disturbing element
where baby is concerned, rang long and per-
sistently. Answering the summons, I heard
a firm voice telling me without preliminary
that “The water is 20 feet at Avondale.” I
expressed my complete indifference. “What?”
came thundering back. “I don’t care,” I re-
plied again dully,” “I will report vou to the
chief,” bawled back the voice. I am a peace-
ful citizen, but a ’phone is a ’phone. “Go
ahead,” I dared; “I am not frightened of
him.” Silence, next a suspicious voice asked,
“Who is speaking?” Cool again and with
perfect imperturbability, I answered, “New-
castle 070.” Suspicion had vanished and
anger reappeared in the voice as it came
back. “Why the h—ll didn’t you tell me
that before?” All the long years of injus-
tice that men of the land have had to put
up with from the Board came back to me as
I got in my final kick before hanging up the
receiver: “Why the h —l did you want to
wake the baby?”
“X.N.0.”: “The American Fleet has been
engaged on the mightiest manoeuvres ever
staged in time of peace,” says the S. M.
Herald, which is utterly incorrect. I ven-
ture to say that each “side” in pre-war
British Naval manoeuvres for many years
before the war was as strong as and prob-
ably stronger than the whole U.S. Navy
put together. To give one instance only, in
1906, during combined Channel and Medi-
terranean Fleet manoeuvres, 68 first-class
ships—that is battleships and first-class
armored cruisers only—dropped anchor and
moored simultaneously in Lagos Bay, s.-w.
Portugal. Naval nomenclature has changed
since then, and the light cruiser has re-
placed the armored cruiser, but not more
than half the above number of first-class
ships took part in the recent Honolulu stunt.
“Nom” : The first man to make money out
of running two-up schools in Australia still
knocks around Waterloo and Alexandria
(Sydney) hale and hearty. He it was who
taught two Engine-street brothers the busi-
ness by which they made their fortune. In
later days the schools used to be conducted
inside, but in the olden time the locale was
Botany or La Perouse bush. The ring-
keeper had to be able to whip any malcou;
tent or else forfeit the job, and as “Tommy
weighed only 9st. and stood little more than
sft. his job was no sinecure. As the two-up
was the only school he ever visited he never
learnt to read or write, but such was hi>
natural shrewdness that with his first ‘earn-
ings” he made investments that have enables
him to live in comfort ever since.

“The Broken Wing,” which opened its
career at Melbourne King’s on Saturday,
yields quite a bright evening’s entertainment.
Into a region of Mexico where Inez Nillera,
brought up by an English foster-father,
Luther Farley, to a regard for soap which
causes her to despise the unwashed Greaser,
awaits the coining of the Gringo husband she
nightly prays the good God to send her,
flying-man Phillip Marvin is suddenly pre-
cipitated. His arrival is a genuine bolt
from the blue; liis disabled ’plane, crashing
to earth, makes a hole in the roof of Inez’s
home, rendered with spirited stage effect.
The observer is killed; but Phillip is left,
with a blank memory and the spotless white
bandage around the forehead which in well-
regulated drama indicates the wounded hero,
to fall in loVe with his nurse, Inez, who
naturally regards him as a Heaven-sent
affinity. The growth of the love-affair is,
however, viewed askance by the Mexican
army, which had counted on winning the
lady for its own; but Captain Innocencio
Dos Santos, who practically becomes the
Mexican army (with the exception of one
private) and its General after shooting a
rival brass-hat in General Parefilo Aguilar,
is pacifled by the idea of exacting ransom
for Phillip, a story of whose wealth has
been conveyed to him by Sylvester Cross,
an American who happens to be pottering
about the neighborhood. Cross, after stipu-
lating for a share of the loot, departs to
America to get the ransom : meanwhile Inez,
who has discovered that Phillip's is an assumed
name, marries the wearer of it. Complica-
tions ensue when Cross reappears with a
lady who is announced as Mrs. Marvin,
although Inez finishes the third act with a

Monte,” and Reg Wykeham as “The

passionate declaration that if God, in answer
to her prayers, has sent her a husband who was
already a married man, it is His fault, not
hers. The mesh of complications, including
the matrimonial tangle and the plight of the
American airman about whose presence the
Mexican Government is suspicious and hos-
tile, is cleared up in the swiftly moving
last act, when happiness comes to every-
body except to the chagrined Mexican army;
though even the General’s offsider Marco
(played tunefully by Charles Waldron) man-
ages a successful love affair with Ouichita
(Sylvia Clifton). Marco’s song in the
closing act is "well sung, but it interferes a
little with the rush of happenings.
* * * #
The acting was consistently good. Three
of the players, Henry Latimer, who enacts
the flea-bitten Mexican General, constrained
to scratch himself against the door-post;
Thurston Hall, as Captain Innocencio Dos
Santos, whose love for Inez induces him
to defy Mexican military traditions by wash-
ing his hands; and Monty Wolf, who played
a live-wire American in Sylvester Cross, were
in the same parts in the London production;
and their acting was easy and finished.
Gladys Webster was a delightful Inez, and
there is no complaint about the way in
which the other parts were filled. On Her-
bert Leigh, as Luther Parley, depended a
good deal; Roland Ward, as the flying-man
who loses his memory, did very well, and
Madge North was a dashing Cecilia.

Kreisler’s violin enchanted four vast audi-
ences at the Melbourne Auditorium last
week. Handel and Grieg were among the
composers represented, and beautiful was
the Austrian’s playing of Handel’s Sonata
in D Major, which other fiddlers heard in
Melbourne have cruelly maltreated. Popu-
lar demand has made extra concerts neces-
sary ; the last of them is to happen to-night.

Melbourne is getting high-grade melody
in torrents just now. To keep up the flow,
Paul Althouse and Arthur Middleton begin
a season at the Auditorium on Saturday.

Black-and-white and color splashes:—
A mixed show of etchings and pen and pencil draw-
ings is on view at the New Gallery, Elizabcth-street,
Melbourne. Practically all of it is good stuff; some of
it very good. John Shirlow’s portrait of Bernard
O’Dowd is fine and characteristic. Lionel Lindsay suc-
ceeds best with “The Great Red-gum” (No. 5) and
“The Dancer” (No. 10) ; H. Van Raalte with “Even-
ing Glow” (No. 52) ; and Harold H. Herbert with “The
Broken Plough.” Sydney, as seen by John Good-
child, is a gloomy city; there is more spright-
liness in Sydney Ure Smith and Nuttall; Lambert’s
familiar “Mr. Smith of Australia” is again on view;
and Miss Spowers’s work (“Cdl’ni-street on Sunday,”
No. 59) also appeals. A collection of pencil draw-
ings by Phil May adds to the attractiveness of a
show which has work in color by P.nleigh Boyd,
Blamire Young, Leslie Wilkie and Harold Herbert,
and some fantastic and clever woodcuts by Margaret
Preston.
A bomb-thrower amongst the artists, G. Pillig is
in the nature of a noisy interruption to the sedate con-
versation of Phillips Fox, Penleigh Boyd, W. D. Knox,
J. H. Cunningham, Gwen Michael, Nicholls Anderson
and others whose pictures are on show at the Queen's
Hall, Melbourne. Pillig’s art is a Marathon in
which form and color sense are apt to be out-
distanced ; nevertheless he does succeed in conveying
a vivid quality of movement. “Races” (No. IS) is
a whirling blur of horses and riders, and the
mauve and pink water in “Seascape” is moving, too.
Gwen Michael, with 'several minor efforts, is the
next largest exhibitor. A “Battlefield” (No. S), oy
F. Crozier, is a dull record without imagination.

The plainltive iinquiries of Muriel Starr’s
romantic stage-aunt concerning her lover’s
whiskers nightly amuse the people of a
whiskerless age at the Melbourne Royal,
where “Secrets” will be told for the usual
tariff, plus tax, for some time to come.

“Kid Boots” skips as brightly as ever at
His Majesty’s, Melbourne, and the curtain
front-scenes ktfep the frivolity moving with-
out a break. But something will have to
be done about 1 the fearful nloise made by the
scene-shifters at the back of the thin par-
tition.

“No, No, Nianette,” is delivering its gaiety
to houses whfleh give the management only
one trouble—that of answering the inquiries
of importunate clients who urgently want
seats at the. New Princess which it is diffi-
cult to find flbr them.

Changes at the “Snap” rfevue at the New
Palace, Melbourne, include* the arrival of
Harrington .Reynolds. Although there was
nothing umlily impressive about Reynolds’s
first appearrmce, he added Jiis modicum of
humor to filie well-spiced dish of frivolity.
Another addition is a scena “The Sun
Girl,” in which Howett Wprster sings pas-
sionately. but “The Dancing IDoll” and “Acci-

A National Gallery venture: —

bourne National Gal-
lery has borrowed from
their owners. The
idea of the trustees is
good, but it depends
for complete success
upon the willingness of
the owners of pictures
to lend them ; and that
may account for short-
comings such as the
absence of a Charles
heeler nortrait and
the exceeding loneli-
. .s or ueoige Coates.

Amber Necklace” is
really a portrait study,
and an outstanding
one at that. It is
doubtful whether even
in Longstaff’s work,
represented by seven
very excellent canvases,
of which the best is
that of David Watter-
son, there is anything
better. W. B. Mclnnes’s work seems to “season” in
a disappointing fashion; his “Miss Collins,” a recent
effort, shows up best. Some of Australia’s best
landscapists are conspicuous by their absence. John
Ford Paterson and David Davies are poorly repre-
sented ; although the Streeton collection is good.
Three n ;table specimens express Max Meldrum’s views
on the simplicity of Art, and there are six witnesses
to Elioth Gruner’s skill.

In “The Point of View’,” presented at the
Sydney Conservatorium by the Players’ Club,
Judge Beeby gives a drama of character
rather than of incident; of thought rather
than of action. The play opens in the homo
of John Davidson (Edwmrd Musgrave), a
vice-president of the Bootmakers’ Union,
which is thirsting for a strike. A memory
of the 1908 struggle between Capital and
Labor has thrown its shadow over John’s
spirit; so good was the acting that you felt
his depression before he uttered his first
word across the rim of his evening paper.
Others under the Davidson roof-tree are a
daughter who would be in the flapper stage
if the family’s circumstances were easier, but
who, already a wage-earner, is sullen-browed
over the inequalities of life; a son at once
headstrong, ignorant and weak-w T illed; and a
small boy and girl for whom the mother is
planning the higher education. Of the four
acts the first and fourth are the best. The
second act in the boot-manufacturer’s home
is too long, and the girl Joan became tedious
in the delivery of her lines, though not so
tedious as the sporting girl, introduced for
no apparent reason but the display of a
golfing rig-out that would make the laziest
cow look up. There are volcanic moments
in the third act, with its flawlessly-repro-
duced court scene, but one remembers most
vividly the scenes in John Davidson’s cot-
tage, the last of which is masterly in its fore-
shadowing of worse evils to come. Eric Howell,
who produced the play, was amazingly good
in the part of Andrew Thompson, the sincere
strike-leader, convinced of the justice of his
cause. Vera Keogh’s Mrs. Davidson wms
easy and natural, but the part of Joan Mars-
land, the rich man’s daughter, w r ho breaks
a lance on behalf of her father’s wmrkers, was
beyond Adeline Taylor. Mollie Iverwin’s
factory-girl and Sally Law’’s chattering neigh-
bor w’ere neat and complete bits of work.

A youth who is getting on:—
Frank Lynch, sculptor, of Sydney, has followed up
his remarkable Faun with a small model of a Diggei
for a war memorial. This is also a fine achievement.
The Digger stands defiantly balanced forward on a
very long and powerful set of legs. His putties are
over his boots and it is a long time since his trousers
have known a press. His small gaunt head is thrown
back and looking sideways, and the rhythm of his
limbs pierces through the untidy clothing and carries
the figure upward as if it were about to leave the
ground. The finished eight-foot statue will need no
pedestal to show it off. It is stated that the young
artist turned down an opportunity to go abroad,
preferring to fight it out in Sydney. It is to be
hoped Sydney will appreciate his action.

A versatile jester is Milton Hayes, Syd-

lightning speed from grave to gay. His
“Meanderings of Monty,” a burlesque elec-

herent sentences, mixed metaphors and
“bulls,” leaves such rival practitioners as
Thos. ’Enley and “Alphabetical” Reid
among the also-rans. Jay Whiddon con-
ceals his shortcomings as a violinist in a
series of freak noise effects, but he is a
change from the hordes of serious-looking
would-be Kreislers so much in evidence just
now. The drum-tapping and gong-beating
Traps is a noisy six-year-old whose sense
of rhythm is a saving grace. Reg
Wykeham, Pressy Preston and Pirie Bush
appear in a bright little sketch entitled “The
Bachelor,” and the Alton Sisters successfully
keep their balance on a tight wire.

Sydney Fullers’ is suffering from an inva-
sion of acrobats who conduct their activities
with a complete disregard of compound frac-
tures. The principal prop, used by Paul
Warton and co. is a springboard that propels
an infant into the air and lands him. after
a double somersault, in a chair held by a
brawny adult standing on the shoulders of
another. The Eleven Wonders alternate
eccentric dancing with freak tumbling. Linn
Smith’s Jazz Band find favor with the gods,
but some doubt exists as to whether any
crowned head would extend them his per-
sonal patrdnage. A pleasing newcomer is
Estelle Rose, whose mimicry of the foibles
of the Chosen is highly relished by patrons
who have done in their good brass with Iky
Mo earlier in the day.
The story in “The Garden of Weeds,”
screened this week at Sydney Hoyt’s, has
been better told before, nor does there seem
any pressing reason wdiy Betty Compson
should change her clothes so often. “On
Probation,” at the Lyceum, presents the Law
as something more than a common or garden
ass; a sentimental Yankee judge releases
a girl with an appalling criminal record by
the simple process of going bail for her him-
self and then allowing his son to propose
to her in court. “Too Many Kisses” are
being given at the Empress. Norma Tal-
madge is the Piccadilly’s “The Lady.” She
reverses the usual movie tradition when, as
an elderly barmaid in a disreputable pub, she
confides to a customer that she only descended
to her present state after a grand career.

Skin.” “Girl Shy” is sailing under a good
breeze of patronage at the Crystal Palace.

Each year finds new commercial uses for wood pulp.
To-day millions of men and women are unconsciously
wearing wooden clothes—wooden hosiery, fabrics:
millinery goods, braids, laces, neckties, ribbons and
countless other articles.
Wood pulp is the base used in the manufacture of
much artificial silk.
In its many forms, however, Wood is being consumed
much faster than it is being grown. Only five per
cent, is being replaced by reafforestation. It is
estimated that in 1 5 years’ time the world will be
faced with a famine in softwoods.
The New Zealand Perpetual Forests, Ltd., is an
afforestation project run on co-operative lines,
designed to meet a national need. It offers you the
opportunity to make a profit of £5OO from £25
invested,
£5OO from £25
£25 will purchase you the yield of one acre of the
Company’s scientifica'lly-afforested land in the
Thermal Region of New Zealand (part of 50,000
acres being planted). After heavily discounting
to-day’s average figures &nd assuming that only 500
out of 680 trees mature that the prices obtained
be only £2 per 6 tree, a of £5OO is assured. And

“Caesar’s Ghost”: The ghost had failed to
walk for several weeks, and Sylvester Saw-
arms gave the manager a hint that some
money would be acceptable. “My landlady
reminded me this morning,” he said, “that I
owe her a month’s board.” “What’s the mat-
ter with her?” retorted the unfinancial
entrepreneur. “Didn’t she know you were
an actor when you went to stay there?”
“Jamwood”: Add the success of G. I*.
Hanna’s Digger comedy co. to the evidence
furnished by “On Our Selection” (B.
0/7/’25) that the public is hungering for
worthy Australian-made theatrical goods, a
fact to which the amalgamations which con-
trol our city playhouses and cinemas are
blind. Hanna, a Maoriland lieutenant, orga-
nised his Diggers at Cologne after the Armis-
tice, and they have been showing ever since.
They had the record run of 18 months (478
performances) at the Brisbane Cremorne,
which seats 2500; and going to Rockhampton
recently they filled the open-air theatre
known as Earl’s Court, which accommodates
just on 4000. And then Hanna had to turn
many away.
THE PROSPECTS.
LANDLORD: “Yen arc you goin ’ to pay me
my rent, mister?"
ARTIST : “As soon as I get a cheque from
a buyer for a painting I’m going to do
when I get an inspiration."
“Treasurer”: “Caesar’s Ghost” was slightly
askew in his reference (B. 9/7/’25)
to Clarence Brune’s season of "His Majesty
the King” at Sydney Cri, The bank clerk
referred to was not connected in any way
with that season. I knew him and Brune
both, and. if my memory serves me rightly,
they had never met. The bank clerk made
his entry into the ranks .of professional
managers when he starred Walter Bentley
and Nellie Ferguson in a fortnight’s season
of “Hamlet” at the Cri. Although the
support was rather feeble the manage-
ment showed a profit of £350 on the fort-
night—a considerable achievement in those
days. Since then the ex-bank clerk has be-
come one of our best-known provincial man-
agers.
“FY7”: To add to her other post-war
afflictions England has had a series of visits
from Hollywood film stars. The latest -was
Tom Mix, who confided to an interviewer on
recrossing the herring-pond that his reception
by the Lord Mayor of London had amazed
him by its dignity. Evidently mayors who
don’t chew Virginia stogies and adorn their
apartments with exuberant cuspidors are new
to Tahm—they certainly wouldn’t suit the
pitchers. At the Tower Mr. Mix saw the
apartment Sir Walter Raleigh had occupied
for 12 years, and was greatly moved. He had
read all about Raleigh, it seems, while look-
ing up details of Dick Turpin!
“Hamfat”: As he was a darned poor actor
and seldom earned more than a super’s pay,
I was surprised to learn from a Yiddish
friend that Cohen had left the stage and
bought the license of a substantial hotel. The
friend saw no mystery in Cohen’s possession
of the necessary money. “Vy shouldn’t he
liaf der money?” he asked. “He vos vour-
teen yearsh on der stage, in regular vork;
and he vos that sort of man who felt sorry
for himself venever he got hungry.”
“C.lv.” recalls a frost:—
“His Majesty,” by Frank Burnand, Rudy Lehmann
and Alexander Mackenzie (B. 2/7/’25) was an inter-
esting failure. The plot was good, the libretto was
far superior to the usual comic-opera stuff, and, to
the surprise of the critics, there was light and lilting
music combined with the scholarly compositions to
be expected from the eminent Alexander. As Mac-
kenzie never used the violins in octaves the orches-
tration was a little sombre at times, but that was
all. The late George Grossmith, having a financial
interest in the thing, stipulated that he should play
the name part. Long before the first night the rest
of us knew that G.G. would kill the piece; and so it
proved. Grossmith had been away from the stage
for some years, and his reappearance was delightedly
anticipated. Before the curtain rose Mrs. G. held
quite a reception in her stall-box, and when Oros
smith appeared the applause continued for some
minutes. But on his taking the call at the end of
Act I he was hooted by the gallery and told to go
home and get work! The poor chap—one of the
most lovable men I have ever been associated with—
played only three nights, after which the late Charles
Workman, here with J.C.W., took it on as under-
study until H. A. Lytt.on was fetched from the pro-
vinces. If Lytton had been His Majesty from the
beginning I am certain the piece would have had a
good run, but a first-night failure is seldom, if ever,
reversed, and the opera was shelved.
“Tinsel”: Perth lived up to its reputation
for being a good show town when the Van-
brugli-Boucicault co. inhabited the place.
Tom Molloy’s theatre, still one of the biggest
in Australia though no longer one of the
nobbiest, was packed every night for three
weeks. Glossy-haired Dion said au revoi-r
in elegant periods full of promises of plums
in the near future.
“Lysander”: Away from the hypnotic in-
fluence of the press-agent we have to own
that our introduction to the world-famous
in art is left until the world-famous have be-
come a little world-weary. We have whipped
ourselves up into hysterics of enthusiasm
over Melba, Irene Vanbrugh, Gertrude
Elliott, Seymour Hicks, Connie Ediss, Huber-
deau, Galli Curci, the Lloyd Sisters (largely
for Marie’s sake), G. P. Huntley, Dot Bouci-
cault and others —dozens of them —but all
the time we have known they are not pos-
sessors of the fresh young art and the fresh
young voices their boosters proclaim. Some
of them were, indeed, almost elderly—in self
and art. Now comes Kreisler. We are
burbling ecstatically over him, but —ah, the
cruel years! Kreisler is a great artist, but
we are not hearing the Kreisler of the press-
agent’s pagans; we are enjoying that super-
man’s artistic uncle, perhaps great-uncle.
If only some of our home-grown fresh young
voices and artists could get the claque
granted the ageing outsider!
“Hamfat”: The habit of rehearsing the
supers apart from the rest of the company
led to our show being deprived of Gussie,
who had been given a small part because he
figured in local “society” and didn’t want a
salary. Gussie was so raw that, having gone
through his rehearsal without them, he knew
nothing about supers. Walking on as an un-
popular character, he saw in the opposing
wings a knot of men who broke into malig-
nant hisses at his first speech, and the experi-
ence so unerved him that he made a fearful
hash of his lines. He had to exit that way,
but as he approached there were fierce cries
of “Kill him!” “Break his neck!” He
paused, terrified, and then, as another furious
shout arose, turned frantically and fled
towards the wing from which he had entered.
In his flight he "upset the juvenile (an obese
gentleman of 60) and the leading lady. A
stout juvenile sprawling among the footlights
docs not look dignified, but it was the lady
who attracted more attention when Gussie
had disappeared.
“E.”: A play that some enterprising Aus-
tralian dramatic society might attempt is
James Joyce's “Exiles,” which has been
staged at the little Neighbourhood Playhouse
in New York. It is a sincere, straight-
forward work, technically of the Ibsen school,
with few characters and two simple interiors.
You can get it in book form, and it is not
at all shocking. The story goes that in
1904 W. B. Yeats asked Joyce to write a
play for the Abbey Theatre. The other re-
plied that he would have one ready in ten
years. He kept his promise, “Exiles” coming
into print exactly ten years later.
“Coot”: What is the record on the Aus-
tralian stage for the number of characters
sustained by one individual on a single
night? Mrs. Coppin, at the old Queen-street
Theatre, Melbourne, in 1845, besides appear-
ing as Lady Teazle in “The School for Scan-
dal,” impersonated eight different characters
in a concluding farce entitled “Winning a
Husband.”
“Lysander”: It may be reaction from the
simpering silliness which marked the “ro-
mantic” play of a few years ago, but tlie
drama fashionable among the neo-Georgian
writers has galloped to the other extreme.
One grows fed-up with fallen sisters and the
weird company they keep. Fallen sister, and
her accompaniments, human and verbal, are
so obviously dragged in solely for shocking
and press-agent purposes. “Spring Cleaning,”
for instance, is a commonplace thing of
marital wrangling, with the Mona situation
so artificial that it stands out like lip-salve
on a Salvation lassie. Monas in real life
would cause clients and police to combine in
a campaign for their suppression—not from
any motives of morality, but on account of
the ladies’ obtrusiveness. Even indecency has
its decencies, as someone has said. Pauline
Frederick would make the tripiest melo-
drama interesting, hut it is pretence to sug-
HIS HOUR.
MESSENGER : “If Amelia Anne could see me now it would be all
over between us.”
gest that anything but nastiness underlies
the prostitution theme. If a “lesson” is
sought for ambitious daughters, a much more
pungent one may be preached from a real-
life text to be found parading any night
under the street lights of Sydney.
“Topee”: I don’t know much about the
fees gained by old-time cantatrices (B.
25 /6 /’25), but in 1877, when Charles
Santley was in his prime with Carl Rosa,
his nightly opera fee was £BO. I know this,
because I made out the cheques for signa-
ture.
“Uramao”: Hori turned up at a small
Maoriland town where Harry Lauder was
to give a show. “Sick and sickpencc!” he
exclaimed, scratching his woolly head. “By
korry, dat a bit ober te odds.” Then he put
the ticket-seller through a series of ques-
tions. “Harry sing te loud song, eh? Him
tell te big joke at te top o’ his voice, eh?”
He was assured that Lauder’s songs and
jokes could be heard at the very end of the
hall —even outside. “By korry, I stay out-
side —all te big talk and te big song for
nix.” So Hori sat outside with ears alert,
and Harry lost 13 saxpences.
“Venturino”: Now that the old ballads
have been returned to their dank tombs let
justice be done to the modern specimens.
What should be the sentence on the perpe-
trator of the subjoined crime, which has
been introduced by the local serio to our
South Aus. village?—
I used t’ love yew, but it’s all ovali,
All ovah neow !
Yew kr.ow it’s all over teown that yew threw me
deown A
But yew shouldn’t let that ainda story get reown’.
I used t’ love yew, but it’s all ovah—-I’ll get along
someheow.
There are things that yew did I used to forgive,
But yew’ll never change just as long as yew live;
Yew’ve had your chance, an’ now it’s all ovah,
All ovah neow!
“Caesar's Ghost”: Once at Newcastle
IN.S.W.) the villain of our dramatic co.
went on strike, and a queer character who
was running a memory-man show in a tent,
and selling knick-knacks as a side-line, was
hired to fill the vacancy. Ho proved himself a
real memory-man by gabbling thi’ough the
part without the script after one reading.
Unfortunately he gabbled through the part
at night, too. Just what he had to do with
his lines and what they meant were trifles
that did not worry him. The old man of
the co. was wondering where his cue had got
drowned in the torrent of verbiage, when
the newcomer shot out the astounding line,
“In spite of all resistance I intend to make
you mine.” The old man blushed violently
and stopped the flow of gabble with a punch
on the nose. Finding the act popular, he
flung the bewildered memory-man against
the backcloth, and the comedian helped him
off stage with a well-directed boot. The
striker, now repentant, took up the
running in the second act, and the
cheerfulness inspired by the expulsion
of the first villain kept the audience in
a good mood for the rest of the night. In
fact, the only annoyed person on the pre-
mises was the memory-man. He hung round
waiting for his money, which he didn’t get.
“Swiss”: Touching the old prejudice
against the opal. In the ’eighties the old
Dongreach Hotel, Brisbane, had as guests
Annis Montague and her husband, Charlie
Turner. Staying there also was Herbert
Bond, a Toowoomba native, afterwards
known in London as the Opal King. Bond
presented Annis with a fine piece of opal,
worth £4O. That night she had a row with
her maid; early next morning I saw her
walk across the street and throw something
into the river. “There,” she said to me, “I
cut its bad-luck career short.”
“Gan”: The bills posted outside most Mel-
bourne theatres must baffle the visitor. As
a rule they announce, not the show being
played inside, but
a show at another
theatre, which, of
course, returns the
compliment. Thus,
if the stranger
comes on a play-
house with “East
Lynne” sprawled
all over the doors,
there will be a per-
formance inside
o f “T h e Giddy
Widow,” or th e
other way about. If
he wants to see the
great melodrama,
“Secret Blood-
stains,” he must
find a theatre with
a poster of “Gig-
gles,” the new re-
vue. No Wonder the
country visitor
stares and gasps
when, instead of the
Oscar Asclie camel
lie expected from
the hoarding, he is
confronted by Com-
mander Allan Wil-
kie as the melan-
choly Dane. One
thin? about this system, it causes a lot of
surprises.
“Hamer”: An unmusical conspiracy in the
streets of Melbourne, consisting of a pair
of voices, a lowly organ and a collection-box,
has compounded a song which can stand up
to some of the ditties recently mentioned in
Poverty Point. Here is a segment, in all
its. glory:—
The pal that I love
Stole the gal that I love,
I gotter just weep and endoor.
lie was cobbers to me;
There’s no eobbcr like ’e—
’E meant not to ’urt me, I’m shore!
The pal that I love
Stole the gal that I love—
That’s why we’re not pals annee more!
The singers shut down after the last pro-
longed “m-o-o-r-e” and collect coppers in the
bar like men whose hearts are broken be-
cause their wives gave them cold sausages
for breakfast.
“Csesar's Ghost” vouches for this:—
For a brief period a show to which I was attached
carried its own private chaplain. I met him in a
small M.L. town to which I had brought him a letter
of introduction, and, finding that he regarded the
theatre as a stronghold of the Devil, I prevailed upcn
him to come and inspect it for himself. He had
never been in a playhouse in his life. I took him
behind the scenes, where he seemed impressed by the
devotion of sundry actors to ladies whom they
presented as their wives, and by the explanation of
the leading female that some stimulant was necessary
playing emotional parts—this apropos of the
whisky'ri On the following night
he called, bringing a flask ijf ths feminine star and
for us the announcement that, as he was leaving
the district on furlough, he would have the pleasuie
of accompanying us to the next town. I never sa-.v
a chaplain get to work so quickly. The “boys,” for
whom he shouted frequently, called him “Old Occa-
sionally” (he had a habit of saying “It does a man
good to get out of the ord-in-ary rut oc-cas-ion-ally 1”) ;
but another word was substituted for “occasionally”
by actor-rs who found him holding the hands of
the dames they regarded as their own property. The
climax developed out of a violent row in one of
the dressing-rooms. The “heavy” had found him with
his arm round the soubrette’s waist, and the parson’s
explanation that he was only doing it in the interest
of the lady’s spiritual welfare was hotly rejected.
He was hurled through the stage door and out into
the night.
THE ETERNAL PAREWELL
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
“Goo’-bye. Goo’-bye!” AA’ith sobbing deep
Her grief she cannot tell.
Yet one brave smile she tries to keep,
While pale girls choke and strong men weep;
It is the star’s farewell.
How sweet she looks, a queen in state!
How can we bear to part ?
Yet she must leave us (such is fate!),
Bright star, superbly passionate,
AVith hand upon her heart.
There’s deep emotion in the stalls;
A fat man starts to cry,
But wipes away the tear that falls.
The star steps forth, as some girl calls
“How can we say goo’-bye?”
“Oh, when will you come back again?”
A flapper’s voice rings clear.
The star sobs out, at first in vain,
And then just gasps, to ease our pain,

ANSWERS TO CORRESPONDENTS.
No notice (except of a hostile character) will be
taken of communications insufficient lu stamped.
Name and address must appear on the MSS. So
liability is undertaken r<* enntriluil inns rnhin-
tarily submitted; and no MS. will be returned
unless slumps accompany.
M.H.H.: Don’t sec a chink that it would
fit R.L.H.: True, no doubt; but too vague to
be useful... .J.W.: A paper that has to cover the
Australian continent once a week can’t afford much
space for overseas cranks.... Scherzando: Don’t
know exactly how “Krygger” is pronounced, but if
it can be rhymed at will with “nigger,” “oblige a,”
“tiger” and “bridge a,” it is a devil of a surname
for anyone to carry... .A.E.S.: The verse has
no real pulse in it. Those vague moral
generalities are rather painful... .M.B. (Warren 1:
It is not dreadful, but the lines are not
very strong, and the general thought is an over-
worked commonplace... .R.H.R.: Poor stuff....
Jielina: It misses, but there is a hint of quality and
force in it M.H.H.: Ugly little yarn with no
point H.H. (Brisbane): The scene was set; but
it hasn’t the touch P. 0. Mac.: Wooden, lumpy
and extravagant J.W.D.: Doesn’t get near
A.G.0.: It takes about ten times as much as that
to make a foundation for a decent yarn Harold
T Not nearly well enough done....Sneck Posset:
The verses are too bad of their kind to have much
interest F.E.R.: Must go back A.C.W.: Con-
ventional old phrases sprinkling verse that is poorly
constructed... .Agnes G.: No use sending us a feebly-
written school essay on a subject about which you
have not one original thought... .A.F. (St. Hilda):
Send it to the girl herself. If she can tolerate the
rhymes, the grammar and the miserable tags you
have proof that she must really love you... ,L L.
(Brisbane) : Topical verse must do something more
than merely paraphrase the paragraph it is based
on K.R.M.: Not up by a good way L.G.R.:
Falls over its own feet too often. Also, that mur-
derous “dawn”-“mom” rhyme shows the sort of
ear you carry about... .Violet M.: “Jim” may have
all the virtues you say, hut he doesn’t show any of
them in the tale S.M.R.: The verse is very
wooden ; the prose is right off our beat. .. .Retep:
Not had of its sort, hut it is a very poor sort....
H.A.0.: Send it to some magazine published in the
interests of sick curates... .Peter: The doleful slab of
misery didn’t move a tear. .. .A.S.M.: Falls far short.
... .Ripponlea; The recipe sounds like*a bit of secret
vegetarian propaganda:—
From an old manuscript I have came to possess
This dainty dish for one or less —
Cut from a loaf with the usual knife
A goodish hunk of th’ Staff of Life.
Spread it all o’er with a layer of jam,
The kind doesn’t matter a tinker’s dam’.
Next, ope a bottle and carefully spill a
Couple o’ drops of fragrant \ a -ilia —
But stop one moment, I forgot to utter
To lay a solid foundation o’ buHer—
When the bread’s beladen with all of these
Sprinkle all o’er with grated cheese.
To lend this dainty added force
Garnish all o’er with tomato sauce;
But don’t mistake for tomato relish,
Or ’twill make the favor simply hellish.
Now take a knife, or if you pre'er another.
And evenly o’er the surface smother.
When you’ve turn’d on the tap for the water to flow
Do you hold the lot under for a second or so?
....Ledraw; The yarn doesn’t thrill us... .W.H.L.:
Not much use pouring out masses of bad verse about
nothing... .Budding: Horrible in every respect,...
W.J.H.: “The Lover’s Boast” is pretty lumpy verse
turned on old commonplaoes... .E.D. (Perth): The
half-bred poet misses... .J.A.K.: Not well enougn
t01d... .M.P.F.: The verse is very weak and thin....
a.E.Y. ; Not quite up.... J.S.D.: The verse is poor
and the point is very small... .M.F.M.: The verse
couldn’t be much worse. It only says obvious
commonplaces in a clumsy way.... J.L.H.: About as
dreary as its subject... .0.A.J.: You have no idea
wliat decent verse is Rozinante: Doesn’t get to
anything worth while... .Q.M.8.: Keeping smiling
won't help you to a better knowledge of the English
language. Read some real books, and when you try
to write, tackle something real.... J.A.S.: The lines
on the American fleet stir us strangely:—
Away in the wide Pacific sea
Here comes a neighboring fleet
They came to us just once before
A welcome to our nitive shore.
They come to us just once again to say
Some solid words of fame
And how they built the Yankee fleet
And by experiments complect
And how she made her name
How she hops o’er mountain waves
And how she crossed the mane
The nations all have national ships
Ships to scrap and ships to build
Ships to scrap with no cnc killed
And ships to build again.
.... James M.: The yarn moves heavily, and it
wouldn’t have been much of a yarn even with the
best telling Cygnet: Misses by some distance....
F.R.A.: The sonnet comes down with a wallop in
the last line of the octave—the place where most
bad sonnets go to pieces. The rhyming couplet at
the end is not in keeping with that form A.L.M.:
Weak verse that goes over all the olj commonplaces
and is tagged out with print-worn phrases
Lucy R.: That alleged free verse can’t come to roost
here. In the first place, it is not verse and makes
very bad prose; and, in the second, it is almost
sheer nonsense without a hint of real thought or
emotion... .J.J.L.: The humor would take a lot of
searching for. There are a few unlikely violences
and some lapses of grammar, but these don’t provoke
anything except pity.... J.McN.: It falls far short.
Don’t try to imitate the W'orst verses you have read.
. ...A.H.Y.; Doesn’t strike us... .H.D.A.: Poor yam
poorly told S.G. (Parramatta) : You use up three
pages saying you are going to tell a yarn and in
the four that follow fail to keep your promise....
H.B. (Townsville) : Joan is very young and crude. ...
Milton L.; Goou of its kind, but not our sort. The
scheme of the yarn is too mechanical....C.W. (Avon-
side) : The arrow has a small point, but its flight
is not interesting J.M.8.; The yam is pretty bald.
as you tell it, but there is material there for a
story... .S.W.S.; Can’t find anything there to get
excited about... .E.V.T.: A poor yarn very badly
told G.S.C.: Wanted more detail to make it
convincing.
TO ARTISTIC (AND INARTISTIC)
CORRESPONDENTS.
W.J.8.: The drawings we most desire are good
drawings and the jokes should be good, too —also
fresh.... L.McC.: You appear to be on the way.
H.D. and A.W.J.: Puns, generally speaking.
haven’t a chance... .W.A.H.: Can’t allow the lady’s left
arm to grow out of her back in this paper H.C.:
Slipshod but vaguely promising. .. .H.M.: Looks like
a woodcut done with a rock-dri11.... H.R.M.: A
low, furtive joke that spends its life dodging editorial
boots A.F.G.: Drawing has no visible means of
support .Anonymous Goth who marred seven fair
sheets of paper: No harm will be done to you if
you call and remove your handiwork.

‘‘Phoney”: It isn’t only the hairpin fac-
tories that have been hit by the craze for
bobbed or shingled hair. The white men on
the Broome (W.A.) pearling luggers used
to carve hundreds of tortoiseshell haircombs
in their spare time, and these found a ready
sale in the southern cities. Lately word
came to them that, owing to the new styles
of hairdressing, there were more on hand
than required. As a rule, the carvers kept
to set designs, but the more ambitious pro-
duced some very fine work. One ex-Digger
still waxes profane over a treasure he sold
for £l5 which later realised £B5 in Bond-
street, London. Shell-openers now spend
their time wrestling with crossword puzzles
and trying to write acceptable pars for The
Bulletin.
* # * *
“C.0.M.P.”: Why will storekeepers persist
in trying to sell imported articles in prefer-
ence to Australian V Asked one a few days
ago for a garden rake. He began by introduc-
ing me to a Yankee production, which I
immediately adjudged too light. He agreed
that it was a bit frail and said he had
another one in another part of the shop
which was all steel. Again it was unsuitable
and imported, and I asked “Have you
no Australian-made?” Yes, he had, but
he did not think they would suit. He led
me back to the part of his premises where
we started from and dug up a “Dad” brand
which was exactly what I wanted. It is
just the same with quantities of other lines.
* * * #
“Herodot”: Reference to the European
custom of trampling down the grapes in the
fermentation-vats with bare feet (B.
1.1/6/’25) recalls that bread was frequently
kneaded in the same way, even in Australia.
After the dough had been mixed it was placed
in the troughs, and all hands employed in
the bakery removed boots and socks and got
to work. In country towns this system was
occasionally found surviving up to about 20
years ago, when a rigid inspection of bake-
houses sent it out of existence. It is only 14
years since one N.S.W. country baker sued
another for damages for slander, alleging
that the defendant had circulated maliciously
the story that he was in the habit of knead-
ing his dough in the old way.
“T.P.”: For six years I have used an
Australian painters’ sash-tool, No. 6, price
3s. 6d., as a shaving-brush. Needing an-
other, I commissioned a local painter to
procure it, and he vainly sieved two Vic-
torian towns for one. There were plenty
of expensive imported brushes, but Aus-
tralian were unobtainable. However, from
a manufacturing firm in Melbourne my agent
brought back a score for as many local
shavers, who want to dodge anthrax, save
cash and use Australian stuff. We saw off
the superfluous wood and soak the bristles
for a night in phenyled water, just to make
assurance doubly sure. The painter him-
self has used one brush for a dozen years
in his trade, so the quality’s all right.
“X2X”: “Jaycee” need not worry about
the recent destruction in Sydney of £15,000
worth of confiscated opium (B. 11/6/’25).
The stuff had been specially prepared for
smoking, and as such was of no value for
medicinal or scientific purposes. Smoking
opium frequently contains not only a high
proportion of coloring matter but also other
drugs such as “hashish” or Indian hemp, and
its morphine-content is usually only about
three or four per cent, instead of the minimum
of 7.5 per cent, required for legitimate pur-
poses. To clean it of its superfluities would
be too tedious and troublesome, and to stand-
ardise it by the addition of more morphine
would be prohibitively expensive.
* * * *
“C.P.S.”: The practice of writing the
sender’s address on the back of a mailed
envelope (B. 25/6/’25) may be common in
America, but I suspect it was borrowed from
France, where it is practically universal.
There being no branch of the French postal
service corresponding to our Dead Letter
Office, the address of the sender is something
more than desirable. I still receive corres-
pondence from friends I made in France
who never fail to add their full address on
the flap, and repeatedly advise me to do
the same.
* * * *
“Albatross”: The sailing-ships Harbinger
and Hesperus, regular traders between Eng-
land and Australia in the early ’eighties, were
really the nucleus of the Orient S. S. Co.,
then the P. S. N. Co. Their respective skip;
pers, Bolt and Harry, through their strenu-
ous “speeding-up” tactic's, became better
known as Bolt and Hurry, and the names,
stuck to the two clippers. Besides 24 A.B.’s
each vessel carried midshipmen and appren- .
tices, and a distinct line was drawn between.
the two ranks. What seems still stranger
nowadays, both carried four negro quarter-
masters, who were looked on with suspicion
by the whites before the mast. The niggers
had “cushy” jobs and separate quarters.
A WARNING.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
Some buyers’ remarks may be strong,
Yet contain a proportion of sense;
They may tell us to go to Hong Kong,
And we don’t, as a rule, take offence.
But I sing of a man who was rude,
Who had only two “tags” in his head.
“The colors are ancient and crude;
The design is on old one,” he said.
When the samples we showed him were dark,
He discovered he wanted them light;
When we livened them up, he’d remark,
“They shouldn’t be nearly so bright.’’
When at last we considered them good,
We awaited his verdict with dread ;
“The colors are ancient and crude,
The design is an old one,” he said.
This gentleman’s curious fate
I fear it may grieve you to learn.
Yet the truth let me briefly relate
To all whom the facts may concern.
One morning I chanced to allude
To a rainbow that arched overhead.
He murmured, “The colors are crude,
The design”.... Then we took him up dead.

Vic. Parliament will have to set about
training a few “table” officers. H. 11. Pear-
son, clerk assistant of the Dreary House, is
due to retire in a couple of months; Newton,
clerk of Parliaments, has only about 18
months to go; and Tom Gilchrist, second
man in the Assembly, cannot have more than
three years left. There are some good men
in the background, and it looks as if
Barstow, Heywood and Conlan will get lifts
before they are much older. Barstow nar-
rowly missed the clerk-assistantship of the
Assembly. If tradition is followed and Alex-
ander becomes clerk of the Council, Barstow
would be in the line of succession in the
Assembly.
“The Deacon” : I also doubt the story of
Father Teuison Woods (B. 18/6/’25) pro-
jecting the marriage service orally across a
flooded creek. If such a proceeding were
recognised as valid by the R. C. Church,
a couple could be married by a priest at the
other end of a telephone wire.
“Sixenate”: A nonchalantly cheerful
debtor helped to brighten up proceedings in
a Melbourne police court the other day.
The peremptory demand of a frowning soli-
citor to be told how a man, who said he had
no means to pay his debts, could go golfing
day after day was met with an earnest assur-
ance that a kindly pal had paid the em-
barrassed person’s membership fees, and that
he could always borrow a bag of clubs.
Under further examination he mentioned that
the gun he used in shooting matches was the
property of a brother, to whom also belonged
the new suit he was wearing; the motor-car
he sometimes drove was lent him by a cousin
whose hours of leisure were few, the cornet
he played at concerts belonged to another
brother, and the motor-bike he rode was the
property of the firm for which he travelled.
The only possessions which the debtor seemed
disposed to admit were his own—and not
supplied pro tern, by accommodating rela-
tives or friends —were a wife and five child-
ren. And he mentioned these with an air
that suggested that the hard-hearted creditor
could have that handful if he wanted it.
“Hopalong” : Yes, gas opened up a whole
lot of new opportunities for the lead-swinger
(B. 25/6/’25). Not that my mate Bill was
one of that class; he merely took the gifts
the gods provided. I had been sent back to
lI.Q. with minor injuries when Bill arrived
from the line with a despatch. Having a
few minutes to spare, he came round to the
doctor with me. The medico took William
for auother prospective patient, and after
finishing with me asked him his trouble.
Bill, who had almost lost his voice as the
after effects of a cold, croaked an almost
inaudible “Nothing, sir.” “Gas?” ques-
tioned the medico sharply, and Bill, having
grasped the situation sufficiently to nod im-
mediately, received his ticket for Blighty.
I met him in England afterwards, and he.
told me that he got a couple of months’ holi-
day out of the doctor’s mistake. Certainly
he was well cursed when he rejoined for
being a lead-swinger, if only a passive one—•
but the curses were those of envy, not of
condemnation.
“Pedro”: Compare “Labor Student’s” (B.
25/6/’25) statistics of the present N.S.W.
Labor party with a few about the original
Laborites of the 1891 Parliament. There
were nominally 36 of them, though the party
was soon split by the fiscal wedge and pre-
sently petered down to an equally nominal
27. Of the 36 three were always doubtfully
solid. Taking the other 33, their average
age was 38. The patriarchs were Donnelly
(58), Newman (52) and Kirkpatrick (51) ;
the babies of the family “Jupp” Gardiner,
now of the Senate (24), and Dr. Hollis
(26). Nineteen of them were English, seven
Australian, two Scotch and two Irish, and
there were an American, a Maorilander and
one born in France. Seven of them were
destined to be Ministers, including McGowen,
Gardiner and our old, persistent friend Joe
Coolc. It used to be said at the time that
Cook, though listed as a miner, contrived
to get among the genteeler jobs around the
pit, and in politics he has lived up to that
report. The only members of the original
party still in politics are Gardiner and
George Black, M.L.C., except that E. M.
Clarke continues to raise his vast voice in
North Sydney Municipal Council.
“Bildad” : I am not surprised that British
engineer Buchanan, while foretelling a great
city of Darwin, wondered what race would
occupy it. Unless Australia gets a move
on we may all have cause to wonder. The
stranger is apt to come and go in ignorance
of the fact that the place was deliberately
handed over in Fisher’s time to the control
of the A.W.U. (Queensland variety), which
put a finishing touch to a big local industry
when it demanded 565. per day for youths
of 18. Or that paralytic Federal Govern-
ments won’t connect the Territory by rail
because there are practically no immediate
votes there. Or that the Australian way of
attracting settlers is to refuse to sell them
an inch of land at any price. The passer-by
comes to the crude, but natural impression,
when he looks at the Territory’s desertion
and decay, that the Australian of British
descent isn’t fitted for tropical settlement
even if other white races are. Why shouldn’t
he?
The death of Herbei-t Benjamin at South
Yarra (Vic.) recalls that his corpulent dad
was Mayor of Melbourne in Queen Victoria’s
jubilee year, and spent lavishly out of his
private hoard on the celebrations. Of course
he got a knighthood. From ’B9 to ’92 the
elder Benjamin was in the Drowsy House.
The best that can be said of him while there
was that he dozed in good company, as the
Chambah had then some talent.
Back in Adelaide after 20 years’ absence
in England, A. G. B. West, formerly a
strenuous young curate in S.A., latterly
rector of the old Church of St. Dunstan, in
the heart of London. This church holds
daily services for the 50,000 people who pour
into the parish each morning; one of them
lives in it, and there is no use for any Sun-
day service. Meanwhile the value of the
site has moved up to an estimated quarter of
a million sterling, and even the Bishop of
London seems to think that this and a bunch
of other old city churches have outlived their
usefulness. West is going to lecture in Aus-
tralia in the interests of Talbot House, fami-
liarly known as “Toe H.”

[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
a silver cloud at sundown,
With Hy-Brasil on his lee,
Palely to the westward sailing
In a bark of ebony,
Only he could ever see them
Only he, and only he.
Just beyond the darkened headlands
As his Port of Peace is won,
Where the Straits of Time eternal
To Eternity outrun,
Does the voyager behold them
Litten by the setting sun.
Does the voyager find waiting
Friendly faces, fair with smiles,
Calling courage, calling welcome,
To the shady forest aisles
And the scented, breezy meadows
Of St. Brandan’s Blessed Isles?
Dreams of childhood, sweet and tender,
Dreams that youth dreamt, proud and
grand,
Toys and loves that Time has broken.
Will he find them on the strand
Flawless, whole again, perfected,
Mended by a Master Hand?
Cobwebs pearled by dews of morning,
Wings of butterflies asheen,
All the magic and the glory
Of the Springtime, glad and green;
All the scent and song and splendor
Of his World of What-Has-Been?
Will the anxious traveller find them
And a million wonders more,
His in gift and right eternal
On the far and fabled shore
Of St. Brandan’s Blessed Islands,
Mystic Isles of Evermore?
Friends and foes, I cannot answer
To that old and sad request.
This I sense that, love or hatred,
With the worst and with the best,
We are sailing, ever sailing,
On and onward to the west.
And as years more wisdom brings us,
And more tolerant we grow,
Comes a meaning and a message
To the only life we know:
“Earn your way and work your passage;
Live and love and let it go!”
Only they, the voyage over,
Sailed they ill or sailed they well,
Yet have learned if Death doth walk in
Robes of rue or asphodel.
Only they, the voyage over,
Only they, and they can tell.
But to-day, in poet fancy,
Looking backward o’er the miles,
I am thinking, hoping, dreaming—-
Foes or friends, with frowns or smiles —
Spite of life and all its failures,
We will see the Blessed Isles.
Through a silver mist at sundown,
From a mansion or a cross,
Knowing then that all our gain is
In the end but worldly loss,
Hope and Faith to be the wings of
God’s grey guiding albatross;
Through a silver cloud at sundown,
With Hy-Brasil on our. lee,
We will see the Blessed Islands
Green and gold across the sea;
But ’tis only we could tell you,
Only we, ’tis only we.

Wet and Dry.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
f HERE were six of us packed with our
chattels into the Warooba mailcar.
Before we had been thrown together
into the jolting companionship of that over-
driven Ford we had been entire strangers
to one another; but the inequalities of the
Warooba-road shake all barriers down.
All the way from Tillett’s Plains our
rough passage was further enlivened by the
sallies of a jovial red-faced man who was
Wedged into the front seat. He it was who
announced with a joyful whoop each wayside
hotel as it hove into sight; he who reminded
the driver that the reeking mechanism needed
cooling; he the first into the bar, the last to
bid the publican a fond farewell. His fund
of witticism seemed inexhaustible, his thirst
Unquenchable. After the third refection
someone called him “Mr. Booz'e,” and he
accepted the name with a ringing shout of
laughter. We seemed to have known him
for years.
When we rattled into Warooba we found
we had half an liQtir to wait for the train,
and half an hour is a long time to wait in
Warooba; so at our jocular friend’s sugges-
tion we all followed him into the gaunt brick
hotel opposite the railway station to sell a
horse.
But, once inside, Mr. Booze’s effervescence
for some inscrutable reason suddenly went
flat. In a subdued voice that gave but little
hint of its previous spontaneity he called for
refreshment. The publican looked sourly at
him a moment and went on wiping the coun-
ter, muttering the while in broad Doric.
The publican was a dour Scot with a
long, cadaverous face which lost itself in a
fringe of black whisker. Hte wore a suit
of sombre broadcloth of mid-Victorian cut:
and sometimes I caught gliinpses of the
wings of a Glactetonian collar and the huge
knot of a black necktie which were partly
hidden by the long beard that swept his un-
yielding shirt-front. I noted that his boots
squeaked cliurchwarcTenly as lie* moved be-
hind the counter. A high-domed hat which
the years had greened and rusted into an
indeterminate shade sat erectly upon his
head. In silence he served us as we named
our drinks; then it came to Mr. Booze’s turn
to speak.
“Mine’s a Black and White, please,” he
said diffidently.
The landlord bent a savage glance from
beneath his beetle brows. “Ar-r ye sure ye’d
no’ prefair a drap o’ cauld tay?” he asked
fiercely, and turned to attend other custom-
ers, leaving Mr. Booze unserved.
To our astonishment our chance com-
panion made no reply to this affront, but
walked quietly out of the bar. When we
came out we found Mr. Booze on the railway
station. He grimaced drolly at us as we
approached. He seemed restored to his good
humor.
“Well,” he laughed, waving an expressive
hand towards the hotel, “I’d never have gone
in there if I’d know I was going to strike
Auld Rabbie, Goodness, I got a shock.
Funny thing, too, because I always look for
a licensee’s name on going into a strange
hotel; it’s the merest coincidence that I
didn’t happen to look up this time. If I’d
seen ‘Robert Donald Anstruther’ over the
door, believe me, you’d never have got me
inside. I had no idea he was in these parts;
last time I saw him he had a pub in a place
called Coal Valley.” He suddenly shook with
internal laughter. “Did you take a good
look at him, eh? Perfect, isn’t he? The
walking prototype of the wowser. He’d
make a fortune on the stage, begad, just to
be himself!”
Now that he had the centre of the stage
Mr. Booze was himself again; he seemed pre-
pared to enjoy himself.
“As you may have surmised,” he said, “I
am an actor. Tragedy was my forte, but
one cannot always have things one’s own
way.
“Some years ago I joined a vaudeville co.
which was* to do a season in a fair-sized
mining-town down south. I could see that
the show wouldn’t hold together long with
the atrocious management it had; and a
couple of months after we opened there was
a big burst up. I don’t know how the rest
of the company got on, but I was stranded
without the price of a meat-pie about me, let
alone my fare back to the city. Now, as
we had anticipated a long, season, we were
scattered about the town in lodgings. I was
with an old dame who was a straightlaced
Nonconformist with a terrible down on der-
rink. There was a local-option poll a few
weeks ahead; and as I was a few weeks
behind with my board I found it expedient
to sit in her antimacassared drawing-room
and talk about the wonderful blessings of
prohibition, rather than give opportunity for
the discussion of more unpleasant topics.
On Sundays I sat under her dry parson at
the chapel; on Wednesday T yapped at the
Church Debating Society. Instead of being
importuned for arrears I became the star
boarder!
“All this time I was lobbying the licensed
victuallers’ headquarters in the town for a
spruiking job—a man must live. They told
me to stand by until they heard whether a
speaker was being sent from the capital or
no. I was getting pi*etty desperate. Then
there came to stay at my hash-foundry the
Reverend Saul Moag, who was to organise
the cold-tea campaign in that electorate.
The old dame was half-delirious with joy
over the honor done her house. The place
became a sort of subordinate headquarters
for prohibition.
“Onp day after I’d talked myself dry at
lunch, the Rev. Saul beckoned me into the
drawing-room. There amongst the wax
fruit we had earnest conversation, and as an
outcome of this he asked me if I’d do a
hard day’s speaking for the cause. Well,
I ask you! Five pounds for the day, use
of a car thrown in, expenses—can a fish
swim? Of course I knew they had no chance
of getting anything but Continuance in that
electorate, so I wasn’t exactly going against
my—er —principles. Anyhow, I thought, to-
morrow’s the day and there’s no chance of
the wets coming to light with a job now;
and—well, it serves them right for their
lack of discrimination.
“That night as I was passing the Royal
Hotel —now, this is a fact —out ran Tim
Brannigan and told me their speaker couldn’t
come; and as he said this he rushed me into
his office behind the saloon-bar where all
the hogsheads of the association were gath-
ered together.
“ ‘Here,’ says Tim, who’d heard me de-
claim often enough in the local theatre;
‘here’s our man. Give him ten quid for the
day; put him on that Southern-road itiner-
ary, and I’ll guarantee he’ll spout as -well
as that bloke who’s let us down.’
“They put a typewritten paper and a
stack of slacker literature into one hand
and a glass of whisky into the other, and
Tim pushed the bottle and a box of cigars
close to my elbow. Didn’t my eyes sparkle
after six weeks of enforced hydropathy at
old Mother Minton’s hash-factory!
“I woke up in the morning with a thick
head to find it was raining eats and dogs, and
I was just about to roll over again when I
spotted Brannigan’s bottle of -whisky on my
washstand. Then it all came back to me: I
remembered that I’d undertaken to spruik
for the shicker-party! So I hopped out of
bed and went to look for the Rev. Saul and
tell him that I couldn’t take his job on; but
I found he had gone out before daybreak.
“Well, while I w*as having breakfast one
of the Rev. Saul’s lieutenants came in wip-
ing the rain off his face and told us how the
plans had been changed because of the bad
weather. His chief’s staff-work was good.
I’ll say that for it. It appeared that the
Rev. Saul had been up half the night watch-
ing the weather, and when he decided that
the rain was set in, he got busy and tried to
hire every hall in the district. But the wets’
organiser had not slept either, and had got
up to the same game. Along the Southern-
road there had been keen competition to
secure the single hall that graces each of
the eight townships where I had to speak.
Moag’s offsider and one of the emissaries of
Barleycorn had practically raced neck to
neck between these places, and the first one
that could do so roused out the sleepy care-
taker of the Mechanics’ Institute, School of
Arts, Manchester Unity Hall or whatever it

TAKE PEPS NOW!
All sufferers from Coughs,
Colds. Sore Throats or deep-
seated Chest Trouble should
know that it is no longer necess-
ary to swallow liquid cough
mixtures into the stomach. This is now an
obsolete method. The new Peps tablets
provide you with a powerful natural medi-
cine which is actually breathed straight into throat (
chest and lungs
You simply strip a Peps of its silver jacket and dissolve the
tablet on your tongue. The medicinal fumes then given off, mix
with the breath and percolate through the throat and bronchial
tubes into the deepest and smallest air-cells in the lungs.
A MEDICINE YOU BREATHE !
This demulcent Peps medicine reaches inner parts of the chest.
It ends germ trouble in the throat and air-tubes, and relieves and
heals the swollen, inflamed, mucus membrane. Coughing is
promptly allayed; hard stringy phlegm loosened and expelled,
breathing becomes easy.
There is no other remedy so pleasant, so safe, or so efficacious
as Peps for dangers and weaknesses threatening the throat,
chest and lungs at this season.
Take Peps to secure freedom from coughs, colds, sore throat,
bronchitis, etc. Don’t venture out day or night without the protection
of Peps. Always dissolve one in your mouth at the very first sign of
throat irritation or chest discomfort. Lastly—be sure you get PEPS.

IN time of accident you need help quickly,
\ and Zam-Buk is always the best, and
most reliable antiseptic first-aid to have
handy. Whether it be a cut finger or a
gashed knee, a scratched arm, burnt hand,
sprain, bruise or open wound, Zam-Buk
can always be depended upon to swiftly
take out pain and soreness, and ensure
clean healthy healing.
Through its valuable antiseptic
property, Zam-Buk guards broken
tissues against infection and quickly
removes all trace of poison. Thus suppuration,
inflammation and ulceration are completely
averted.
The secret of Zam-Buk’s great success is its
herbal character, its constant reliability and
wide range of usefulness. Every home needs
its ever-ready box of Zam-Buk.
THE GREAT
ANTISEPTIC HEALER
happened to be called. There was no tele-
phone connection along the Soutliern-road
except with the collieries and the post-offices.
Honors were even. Each side booked alter-
nate halls. While I was chewing over this
information with my cold toast, the Rev.
Saul put his head in the door and called
out: ‘Now, brother, here’s your car in front.
Sorry I can’t send a driver. Remember if
the rain keeps up we’ll have to hold all our
meetings under cover. If the weather does
not mend you will only speak at four meet-
ings instead of eight. Unfortunate ; but then
you’ll be able to make your addresses twice
as long, will you not? Now away you go,
and the Hoard with you!’
“The front door slammed, and I jumped
up and knocked the flower-vase into a typist's
porridge in my hurry. 1 raced up the
ha'll.
“ '.Just a minute. Mi'. Moag,' 1 bawled,
but when I got on the verandah I found his
car had disappeared. Another car was stand-
ing empty in the rain. I went back to my
room and sat down to figure things out. I
had a good nip of whisky and another; then
I put the bottle in my overcoat pocket and
went out, cranked up my car. got in and
drove off. Outside the Royal Hotel was all
the talent I’d seen last night, and there was
quite a stir as I pulled up. 1 was a bit
screwed, feeling fit for anything, and fairly
sizzling with the humor of the idea that I
had the confidence of both camps; and when
Tim told me what 1 already knew—that he
could only hire four halls out of the eight—
it was as much as I could do to keep a
straight face. The barman brought me out
a stirrup cup, and while Tim was talking
about his four halls I was chuckling to my-
self to think that I had actually been engaged
to speak in those other four halls.
“Then it struck me all at once that if the
rain kept on I could speak in all eight town-
shins. Yes! Why not? Fulfil both engage-
ments, satisfy both parties—and. well, a man
must live. To-morrow was pdlling-day; but
if I could snatch two cheques to-night, where
could I not be by to-morrow with fifteen
pounds in my pocket? The notion tickled
me so much that I started the engine deter-
mined to get away before someone offered to
come with me; or they changed my pro-
gramme, or some fool asked me inconvenient
questions.
“ ‘Oh well!’ shouted Tim, as I prepared
to move off. ‘Deal it out to them. That’s a
nice car you’ve got; did you get it at Ryan’s?
Don’t forget Ranger’s Hill, Shalesville, Mun-
dobree and Coal Valley if the rain keeps up.
On the pub balconies if it’s fine. Hope it
fines up.’
“‘I don’t,’ I thought, as I opened her out
for the thirty-five miles run to the first of
the Southern-road townships. The rain
came down heavier than ever as I skidded
along that muddy road, and just outside the
first township 1 stopped and had a stiff
wad: and glad J was to get it. because 1
was almost chilled to the bone. Ten minutes
later I was holding forth in the cause of tem-
perance in the Billigool Foresters’ Hall. At
the next township, ten miles further on, I
lunched and otherwise refreshed at the
Ranger’s Hill Hotel and then championed the
cause of John Barleycorn in the local
Mechanics’ Institute; and so I kept work-
ing my two programmes. But I had to watch
those two time-tables pretty closely and see
that I appeared at the meetings at the right
times ; sometimes I had to run back to a
wretched burg I’d left five miles or so behind
to keep to schedule. My great fear was that
some interfering panjandrum from either
headquarters should blow along to see how
things were getting on. But that didn't
happen; no one would have taken on that
long wet trip for fun.
“The tide was out in my original bottle,
but that didn’t matter —I’d only to ask for
anything at any pub where I was accredited,
and I got it on the nod. If I’d asked for
fizz I’d have got it-.; in fact, I’m not too sure
I didn’t.
“I can hold my liquor with the best of
them, but by the time I got to Coal Valley it
was a quarter to ten, and I was just about
slewed. The night was as black as the ace
of spades and I was nearly bogged a couple
of times in the half-flooded streets; but after
I’d run into a wire fence and nearly cap-
sized over an embankment, I found the hall,
where a local speaker was holding the boards
against my arrival. This native Demosthenes
had just wound up his peroration as I took
my seat on the stage, flushed with triumph
and whisky. I’d had a great day. There
was a capacity house, and I felt in tip-top
form for the final flutter.
“The loud and insistent applause that
broke out on my appearance drowned the
chairman’s introductory, remarks. Then just
as I was about to rise I i\yis suddenly frozen
stiff with horror. For the life of I
couldn’t remember whether this was a Wet
or a Dry meeting. Feverishly I fumbled in
my pockets for those sodden bits of paper
that had been my guide all day. ’Twas no
good; I’d lost them! I had been looking
at the chairman, hoping he’d find something
more to say, but as no one had heard a word
of his speech because of the noisy welcome
I was given, he sat down.
“As I looked at that chairman my confi-
dence returned. No, there could be no mis-
take ; so I got to my feet and released my
impassioned eloquence. But, in spite of all
my oratorical efforts, I was vaguely conscious
that something was wrong. In a few seconds
I was sure of it; for those on the stage arose
as one man, violent hands were laid upon
me, and I was: propelled to the stage door
and flung into the outer darkness.”
Between the; gusts of laughter someone
spluttered: “Oh! Oh! I see! You wore
shiekered and started to slatherwack the
Drys from their own platform!”
Mr. Booze grinned through a haze of
tobacco smoke.
“No, my friend, it was the other way
about: I was abusing the Wets from their
own platform !” He leaned back in the
cushions and broke a by-law of the Railway
Commissioners; by placing his feet upon the
seat opposite, as he continued: —
“But it was an excusable mistake. I took
my cue from the cut of that chairman’s jib
—a more wfowsery-looking person I never
saw. That was my cue. A wrong cue, of
course, for who was that chairman but Auld
Rabbi e AnstJ ir-rtither-r!”

Fever.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
IW ASTERS sank listlessly into a deck-
IVI cliair > and a sli s bt tremor shook
him. It had boon a hard day—a
day of a bald, blue sky and a scorching sun
that beat upon his head like a furnace blast;
a day when the shrewd gentlemen of Arikaka,
with their notebooks and pencils, jotting
down suspiciously the weights recorded on
the rusty steelyard, had been more than
usually exasperating. The pungent reek of
their sweating, brown-skinned bodies had
nauseated him; their refusal to recognise
that he was “another-kind trader,” trying to
give them a square deal, had disgusted him.
It w T as not his fault that they had been
demoralised by association with the wrong
kind of white man.
With dull eyes he watched the sun flame
down into the sea, turning the sky into a
riot of shimmering gold shot with vermilion
and flecked with crimson. The air seemed
alive with mysterious noises—the chirp of
crickets, the bell-like notes of frogs and
the rustle of palm-fronds stirred by the faint
breath of the land breeze.
Night descended, and suddenly he felt cold.
He could hear Ivamari rattling crockery in
the kitchen. There would be tinned “bulla-
maeow” for dinner, and tinned cabbage, and
tinned —pah! How he loathed the very
thought of a tin !
“No kaikai, cookie,” he called wearily.
“Tea, tlia’s all.”
The “boy” brought a steaming pan n'kin
and wrapped a blanket around the white
man’s shoulders.
“More better you go sleep, taubada,” he
said, and his dusky face assumed an expres-
sion of solicitude. “Gott’m fever, 1 t’ink."
From the “boy-house” came the syncopated
notes of a tin-whistle and the twang of a
Jew’s-harp playing a tuneless, monotonous
air. A dog howled mournfully, and then
from the direction of the river there arose
a deafening roar, lialf-bellow, half-squeal,
like the death-cry of a wild boar impaled on
the hunter’s stake. Masters shuddered. Then
he laughed—a silly, teetering, hysterical laugh.
He had never become accustomed to the bel-
low of the bull-alligator calling to liis mate.
He huddled into his blanket, squirming
this way and that, twisting his body into
grotesque contortions, striving to find relief
from the dull ache which began to rack his
limbs.
“Taubada!” Kamari’s voice was insistent.
“More better you go sleep.”
“Go away, boy!” Masters raised his hand
impotently. “I’ll —I’ll — g’li'ay!”
His voice trailed off as another bellow
from the river rent the night air. He shook
with sudden dread. His eye roved help-
lessly, to rest on his rifle standing in a
corner of the dimly-lit room, and he felt
comforted. To-morrow he would get that brute.
What a fool he had been to build on a mudflat
when there was so much high land handy! _
He staggered to his feet and dragged his
chair to the verandah. The jungle chorus
should have died away long ago. Mysteri-
ously the confused noises of the night seemed
to have gained volume, and now thundered
in his ears like the roar of breaking seas on
a rock-shelved beach. Five —ten —fifteen —
good God ! He had swallowed forty grains
of quinine that day! No wonder his ear-
drums felt as if they would burst.
Ivamari was still pottering about in the
kitchen. Why the didn’t he turn in?
He was a good lad, Ivamari, different from
these tight-laced, truculent Mekeo bucks who
swaggered into his store, pawing his stock
and arguing about the price of cocoanuts.
A pity the local nuts were so small! In
the Gulf a man could trade a “stick” for
twenty nuts, and five thousand would make
a ton. Here a ton of copra took all of six-
seven thousand —seven thousand —alligators!
Ugh! That brute again! To-morrow he
would —he would ——
A faint odor assailed his nostrils, an odor
of musk blended horribly with something
foul, something abominable. Fear gripped
him—blind, unreasoning fear. Tiny points
of light flashed before his eyes, his body
seemed to be burning in a consuming fire,
and his head throbbed agonisingly. Then
suddenly he felt strangely calm, strangely
cool. He stood up, and his eye sought his
rifle. He did not know that he was swaying
like a drunken man; he did not know that
the hand that clutched the weapon shook
and trembled; he did not know that stark
madness blazed from his eyes.
He was back on the verandah, lurching
towards the steps. The floor was rising
and falling, like the deck of a ship at sea.
His free hand clawed the air, groping for
the verandah-rail. Damnation! Where
were those steps?
At a frightened shout from behind him
he wheeled in sudden rage. A pair of sinewy
hands gripped his ankles. He lashed out.
and yelled exultantly as he felt his heavy
hoot meet soft flesh. He heard somebody
whimpering in the darkness, and, _as from
a great distance, a frightened, faltering voice.
“Taubada!”
Ah! Ivamari —the murdering swine!
Blind rage surged within him. He
staggered forward, swinging his rifle up-
wards. Then he felt his, strength ebbing
from him. A luminous mist swam before
his eyes, and he was falling;—falling.
» * * *
The first faint streaks of dawn were filter-
ing thi’ough the jungle when Masters came to
himself. The fever had left him, but he felt
cramped and cold. He rose stiffly to his
feet, and at the sight of Kamari —lying flat
on his back fast asleep, his head pillow r ed
on the stock of the rifle —he scratched {his
head in faint bewilderment. “Must have
had the dingbats pretty bad!” he muttered.
He seated himself on the steps, his brow
furrowed, his mind vaguely troubled. Sud-
denly he started, and an expression of horror
came into his eyes.
“Good God!” he gasped through stiff lips.
A dim recollection stirred within him. He
felt his heart thumping, and he broke into
a cold sweat.
Within three feet of the bottom step,
clearly impressed on the soft mud, were the
tracks of a monster alligator.
