Lagging Footsteps
Sir Humphrey Ilolleston, President of the
Royal College of Physicians, has written a
book (The Medical Aspect of Old Age: Mac-
Millan) which might have been extraordi-
narily interesting to non-medical readers if
done by a literary genius such as Huxley
or Treves, but still fascinates by its solid
learning, even though it is stodgy and
technical.
lii very primitive organisms there is no
death, for, as reproduction occurs by divid-
ing into two, the individual never dies; but
it has been discovered that every time it sub-
divides it actually rejuvenates itself, so it
is hardly fair to say that it is immortal.
Ihe problem before mankind is to rejuven-
ate the individual, and that is far more diffi-
cult m a mammal than in a lowly organism
such as a paramoecium ; still more difficult
in a man, the highest of all. That is part
of the price we have to pay for our brain.
Old age creeps on us with lagging footsteps,
and we are. old before we have forgotten
what if is like to be young. The first sign
ot age generally appears about 50, when
we notice that we cannot run or swim
so vigorously as we could do 20 years
before; the first sign of intellectual
degeneration about 65 or 70; and the
dictum of the psalmist that the days of a
man’s years are three-score and ten’ and if
by reason of strength they are prolonged to
tour-score then is liis strength but labor and
sorrow, is still true, with all our modern
science. It is in youth that we save life.
lew men die of old age. More frequently,
owing to the sad faculty of old age for con-
cealing its diseases, old men die of some
intent pneumonia or other infection which
is as much an accident, as though a tram
had slaughtered them. Cancer appears to
he almost as if a twin-brotlier had risen
and turned murderer; for it is our own de-
generated cells that turn cancerous. As of
Romulus one might say:—
He slew his brother twin,
Inexpiable- sin 1
The male sexual gland, the testis, con-
tains both germ cells and interstitial ceils:
something the same might be said of the
female oVary, though tfiat does not appear
to be so well understood. The interstitial
cells become very active about the age of
puberty, and are believed to cause the vital
change that occurs at that time. After 30
they degenerate and disappear, and in old
age are feeble and few. Sometimes they
persist, and then we have the pitiful tragedy
of an old man who stands in the dock' for
rape or indecent assault. ■ Judge, magis-
trate, jury and public howl for the rope
to exterminate this scandal on the human
race; and Medicine and Imw renew their
eternal combat, which probably began in
the Stone Age. “De minimis non curat Hex,”
find how could you expect a judge with his
interstitial cells vanished to regard those
of a poor old man whose cells should have
disappeared years ago if he had been a right
and proper member of society? In a sex-
case the man is always infamous.
In the lower afiimals the experiment has
been tried of implanting pieces of testicular
substance from the young; and the result
has undoubtedly been to prolong life and vital
power In man the results are various-
good, bad and indifferent. One man of 70
was to lecture on the marvellous results
the operation had had on himself, but un-
happily he died that very morning, of pneu-
monia, and the necropsy showed no results
v\ hatever of the operation. All we can say
is that in man it is decidedly less success-
iul an operation than in rats, possibly be-
cause man is not meant to live longer than
three-score and ten. Again we must pay
for our brain.
In old age the dinging to life is savage-
even bloodthirsty— though as the fatal ill-
ness draws to a climax the old man accepts
llie inevitable and falls asleep as a baby in
liis mother s arms. If anyone really wants
to live longer than three-score years and ten
—and one doesn’t quite see why—the regimen
is fairly well understood. First, select your
ancestors from a long-lived family, for the
average age of your parents and grandparents
will probably approximate to the age which
you yourself are destined to reach. Sec-
ondly, take no alcohol—and by “no” I
mean no; not merely “a little.”' Thirdly
do not catch syphilis. Fourthly, live in the
open air, preferably the country. Fifthly
be moderate in all things. Sixthly, eat
sparingly; remember the ancient Arabian
proverb that a good cook and a young wife
are fatal to an old man.
But how much more delightful Rolleston’s
book might have been with the literary
giaces suited to its entrancing subject
though it might not have been scientifically
so valuable ! If only Huxley had written it
then it might have been both !

“Expressionism” in Drama
Ibsen, Bernard Shaw, Tchekhov and other
gieat dramatists have been played occasion-
ally m Australia, but no theatre or reper-
tory society, as far as I know, has yet
staged anything by Strindberg, or Andreyev,
not to mention Eugene O’Neill and other
playwrights who belong to the ultra-modern
school As in the art of painting, so in
dramatic art, there has been a reaction from
°T'' f° rrns ° f realism or “represen-
tation. Naturalism has given place to
symbolism, impressionism to what is called
expiessionism.” The labels have little
importance; and many works that are de-
scribed as _ expressionist” contain “realist”
or impressionist” elements. But a tendency
towards greater freedom of expression both
m form and content, a contempt for dog-
matic formulas, and a desire- for bold experi-
ment is manifest in all branches of modern
A good example of “expressionism” in
drama is the work of the German writer
Georg Kaiser, one of whose plays has been
translated into English under the title of
hrorn Morn to Midnight,” and published
by Hendersons at the Bomb Shop, Charing
Gross Road, where the curious may find a
varietynf plays, Swedish, German, Russian
Serbo-Croatian, and even Australian. It
was regarded as a notable play in Germany
and recently it has been staged in London
Iby the Stage Society, and in New York by
the_ Theatre Guild, a new and enterprising
society that gives a wonderful programme
of modern European and American drama.
Georg Kaiser is a German writer with*
definite views of the relationship of art to
society. A year or so ago he was brought
before the. court for selling some of the
furniture in a house that he had rented.
His defence was that he stood above the
conventions of society, and had a perfect
light to sell other people’s things when he
needed money to finish'his great work. The
owners of the property, he said, should feel
honored that they were able to assist him,
even by such humble means as the sacrifice
of a little furniture, in the production of
his masterpieces. But the (lull, ignorant
bourgeois failed to realise their mission;
they thought more of their solid chairs and
tables than of the new expressionist drama ;
and a humorless German judge deprecated,
with characteristic ponderosity, the artist’s
social ethics, and sentenced him to a month’s
imprisonment. Kaiser’s fame, however,
spread, and he became one of the most popu-
lar of the new school of German dramatists.
“From Morn to Midnight’’ is by no means
a great play, perhaps it is not even good
one; but regarded as an example of a new
technical method, it has considerable inter-
est. Everybody is tired of the so-called
“well-made” play, with its pretence of unity,
and its limited scenes into which every
action must be fitted. The-, new school
favors a freer structure, in the Elizabethan
rather than the Greek style, seeking rather
than avoiding frequent changes of scene. In
many respects it is easier to disperse the
action through 14 or 1G scenes than to con-
centrate it into one, in the classical way;
and with the new method there is always
the danger of vagueness ‘ and formlessness.
Hut, after all, each form has its special
merits and defects; and good plays, and
bad, can be written in all styles. But for
more than a generation dramatists have been
afraid to break from the tight-laced Ibsen
technique, though to a certain extent their
methods have been conditioned by the
mechanical and scenic resources of the
theatre fbr which they were writing. In so
far as the dramatist feels less bound by
arbitrary rules and restrictions, the change
is all for the good.
Kaiser’s remarkable play is divided into
seven scenes. There is no plot, no climax,
no scene a faire ; and practically there is
only one leading character, as in Eugene
O’Neill’s “Emperor Jor.eS” and “The Hairy
Ape.” The story deals with the spiritual
adventures of a cashier in a bank in a Ger-
man town. One day a beautiful Italian
lady walks into the bank. There is some
difficulty about a letter of advice, arid the
manager thinks she is an adventuress. The
cashier is infatuated ; and, yielding to a sudden
impulse, he takes a large sum of money
from the vaults. He then goes to the
hotel and offers the lady everything if she
will become his mistress. But the beautiful
Italian is a respectable matron, travelling
with her son ; and the disillusioned cashier
takes to flight. The third scene shows him
tramping through the snow. He cannot go
back now, he must pursue his adventures to
the end. In the next scene he returns to
Ins home; but now he has no interest in its
smug middle-class comfort. Since his mad
act of stealing his life has been revolution-
ised. Though it seems futile, he will go
further and explore any new avenue in the
quest for vital experiences. The fifth scene
takes place at a great cycle meeting. We
feel the crowd, the mad excitement. He goes
into the box and offers vast sums for prizes
to increase the frenzy. This is life at last
noise, tumult, excitement. But suddenly a
German Prince appears ; the stewards bow,
the huge mob becomes silent before this
shoddy deity. This is another disillusion-
ment. He leaves in disgust, and seeks the
.toy of life in a cabaret. First he orders
supper, with champagne, for a beautiful
young woman. He dreams of a pagan orgv ;
but his companion only gets sleepy with the
wine, so, in robust Northern style, he turns
her out. Two other pretty and tempting-
girls prove to be only mean little mercen-
aries. But a vvoman in a long gown seems
strangely alluring. She is not dancing like
the others. He advances; but alas! he is
again deceived—she has a wooden leg. Life
is a mockery. In the seventh and last scene
he appears in a Salvation Army hall. Per-
haps amid this hysteria and crude emotion-
alism he may experience some spiritual
excitement in confessing his sins and taking
his place on the penitents’ bench. AfLi-
ma king a speech he takes out a bundle of
notes and scatters them among the crowd.
1. liore is a wild fight, and soon the penitents
have disappeared with the money. Only the
cashier and one Salvation lass remain. She
was the only one who didn’t fight for the
notes. But now she goes out to return with
a policeman and claim the reward offered
for the. arrest of the cashier. Everything is
disillusion, deceit, futility. He ends the
comedy with a revolver shot.
The play, which has, plenty of energy and
a savage humor, is not as gloomy .'as it
might look from its mere story. Indeed, the
story, the external action, is nothing. ’The
adventures of the cashier are symbolic,
though the symbolism is often grotesque and
rather heavily Teutonic. Instead of charac-
ters there are states of soul, instead of the
representation of life there is an attempt
to suggest the dynamic forces that lie beneath
its surface. This is what is meant by
expressionism,” a tendency that can b»
traced in most branches of modern: art.
“From Morn to Midnight” is a good
enough example of a new school of drama ; but
it is unlikely that it will appeal to any of
our repertory societies.

You Know What Each
Customer Owes
It is worth a good deal in any business, no matter how large or small, to know
at all times just how each account stands, and this is only possible by having
the ledgers posted up to date and in daily balance.
Posting ledgers with a Burroughs Book-keeping Machine is simple, and largely
automatic. The machine adds, subtracts, prints dates, descriptions, ciphers
and punctuation, and extends balances automatically—relieving the operator of
all figure drudgery.
With every account in daily balance you can tell at a glance exactly how much
each customer owes. Furthermore, the Machine makes it possible to eliminate
the month-end rush to strike a trial balance and prepare customers’ statements.
Have a Burroughs representative call on you. He will make a practical demon-
stration of the many advantages you will gain from the use of a Burroughs
Automatic Book-keeping Machine. This demonstration will put you under no
obligation.

DAVID JONES'—-Opp. G.P.0., SYDNEY
method of pickling moonbeams; what ought
I do? Shall I gravely discuss the details of
his' method? Or ask him to prove first that
moonbeams can be pickled? Why, then,
should I discuss the details of his or any
scheme for an Academy of Letters if I be-
lieve, as I do, that it would prove not a
nurse but a stepmother to our literature?
“D.M.W.” seems ready to ignore all the facts
of literary history. At the period of the
renaissance there sprang up literary acade-
mies in Rome, Florence, Bologna, Naples,
Ravenna; in fact, in every semi-independent
Italian State. “They were,” says J. A.
Symonds, “the playthings of a nation fast
degenerating into intellectual hebetude,” and
all but one perished from the consequent
impotence and sterility. If I chose to re-
late briefly some incidents in the long life
of the more famous French Academy, it
was because we can thus perceive both the
merits and the defects of such State-sup-
ported institutions; certainly one of its
prime defects is that it neither gave nor gives
ambitious youth help to a career in litera-
ture.
Now “D.M.W.” proposes to attain this
laudable end by founding a State Academy
on what he regards as a novel plan, and
complains that I have not attempted to ex-
amine it. I shall give him the criti-
cism for which he asks. The French Academy
was founded and is supported by the French
Government; its members are elected fox-
life and limited to 40 in number; about
two new members are chosen annually by the
remaining academicians from the ranks of
professional men of letters who have pro-
duced several masterpieces. The proposed
State Academy is also to be founded and
subsidised by a State Government; its ori-
ginal 12 members are to have an automatic
annual increase of four new members, co-
opted, as in France, by the existing members
from the writers of perhaps one masterpiece
only. In France each academician receives
a small yearly honorarium; here he is to
receive a large sum of money on election
and nothing afterwards. The constitutions
of these two State-founded, State-subsidised,
self-electing bodies seem to differ as tweedle-
dum and tweedledee; the only apparently im-
portant difference centres in the mode of
election. Personally I cannot convince my-
self that a change in the mode of election
will effect a deep and lasting change in the
human nature of the elected, though they
be literary artists; but life would be dull
without such illusions. I pointed out how
little the creative writers who form the
French Academy had done to encourage
young authors, how it had been at times
tainted with the corruption of politics and
at times narrowed by religious bigotry, how
it had bowed the knee to rank, fashion and
riches, had frowned on the happy audacity
of unknown youth and smiled on the com-
pliant dullness of age. Only an incurable
optimist would expect or even hope that an
Australian Academy, almost the replica of
the French, will escape the evil influence
of corruption, bigotry, servility and literary
hatreds, and set up some fabled golden age
of letters because, forsooth, the members
are Australians, elected on a slightly dif-
ferent principle.
But “D.M.W.” will say, “young men will
be in such an Academy as I propose.” It
will begin with “a dozen writers of creative
work” chosen bv the N.S.W. Government —
average not less than 40 years; and there
will be added automatically every year four
more such writers —average age about 30
years. In 10 years the Academy would
number about 45, in 20 years about 75,
in 30 years about 100 members, which
would be about its normal number ; on reach-
ing this limit one of its slight differences
from the French Academy would disappear.
Probably for the first 10 years of its existence
comparative youth might reign supreme;
but once it attained to its full growth
the majority of its members would lie nearer
50 than 40 years of age. The temporary
reign of youth would vanish, and again, as in
France, “the dead hand of the past would
be laid --ion the working present.” There is
yet another point. France thinks one acade-
mician to each million of its people enough ;
in consequence the 40 members enjoy the
respect and esteem of all Europe, and the
most distinguished foreign men of letters
value the honor and prestige of being elected
corresponding members of the Academy. If
in 30 years N. S. Wales has a popula-
tion of three millions, it would then have
one academician to every 30,000 people.
Does “D.M.W.” still think “the rank and
title of academician would mean respect
for the writer’s pen both at home and
abroad”? Would not 100 literary artists
prove a greater burden to N. S. Wales than
she could bear? Such an academy would
be the joke and laughing-stock of the liter-
ary world.
I shall now dispose of “D.M.W.’s” “three .
strong reasons for the establishment of
such an academy.” His first reason is that
imported shoddy poems, plays, fiction and
essays absorb money that ought to be spent
on home-made belies lettr.es. Unless this
new academy is to have despotic power to
vetb imports of new books, which, in its
opinion, ought to be “manufactured at home”
—to use his delightful phrase—l fail to see
how it could prevent what he thinks is an
ignorant purchase of inferior literature. I
pass over without more comment this hint
of a new index expurgatorius based not on
bigotry but on bogus patriotism. It is incor-
rect to say that the Australian author is
ruined or even injured by British cheap
writing. In 1919 nearly 190 books of new
verse appeared in the British Isles, but one
might have ransacked all the bookshops in
Australia without finding even one copy of
quite 150 of them. Of the 40 books of new
verse which did come to Australia, there
would be imported from six to a dozen copies
of books by new writers, and from 20 to 100
copies or more of the better-known poets.
Inquiry leads me to believe that not 1000
volumes of new British verse come to Aus-
tralia each year; and booksellers are of
opinion that the buyers of these books would
certainly not buy an equal, number of books
of Australian verse, were imports entirely
cut off.
His second and third strong reasons may
be taken together. His articles implicitly
suggest that Australia teems with unpub-
lished literary masterpieces—poems, plays,
novels, essays—scorned by timid, money-
grabbing publishers; one function of his
new academy will be to rescue some of these
gems from undeserved oblivion. Let him
survey 400 years of English literature, and
I challenge “D.M.W.” to cite me the name
of one author of eminence whose title to
fame rests on posthumous works for which
he could not find a publisher in his life-
time. Literary history is rich in many an
example that shows how T the unconquerable
will, the invincible vanity and the imperish-
able ambition of the author rise triumphantly
superior to neglect, disappointment, priva-
tion, disease and even death; somehow or
other the masterpiece is printed. The mute,
inglorious Miltons exist only in the fancy
of the poet. Figures seem also to prove that
the Australian poet or versifier finds publi-
cation of a book of verse no more difficult
than his brother bard in Britain. During
the 10 years 1901-10 Australia averaged 13
volumes of new verse per year; in the
decade 1911-20 Britain produced about
140 such volumes each year. The outputs
are relatively equal.
A. HART.
Some New Jane Austen
“I murdered my Father at a very early
period of my Life, I have since murdered my
Mother, and I am now going to murder my
Sister.”
This is one of the artless heroine’s state-
ments, from a new little volume of Jane
Austen, that Chesterton picks out for notice
in a characteristic preface. “Personally I
think it admirable,” he chuckles, though for
some obscure reason he thinks it necessary to
explain: “not the conduct, but the confes-
sion.” Love and, Freindship is the title of
this just-published collection of fragments
that the clever little lady of Steventon Rec-
tory wrote in her middle teens. Through-
out, the spelling and punctuation are pro-
phetic of “The Young Visiters,” though
otherwise there is no resemblance, but all
the difference between a naive observation
of human acts and a shrewd understanding
of human motives.
Besides the romance of the title, there are
“Lesley Castle,” “The History of England”
(“By a partial, prejudiced & ignorant
Historian,” says the youthful writing on its
first page; “N.B. —There will be very few
dates in this History”), and some miscel-
laneous letters and scraps. Altogether they
are a series of exercises in the joyous satire
that was to bubble over triumphantly in
“Northanger Abbey,” satire on tlm senti-
mental “shockers” of her day, which she
devoured and enjoyed, and then with gay
ingratitude turned into ridicule. More than
20 years later her view of them was un-
changed, and she wrote in a letter to an
admirer who wished her to produce a novel
on his own stereotyped suggestions:—
I could not sit seriously down to write a serious
romance under any other motive than to save
my life; and if it were indispensable for me to
keep it up and never relax into laughing at my-
self or at other people, I am sure I should be
hung before I had finished the first chapter.
At the time these early skits were being
perpetrated, Romance in England meant Mrs.
Radcliffe and a number of inconsiderable
and long-forgotten followers, from “Monk”
Lewis downwards. The writer of “The Mys-
teries of Udolpho” had a certain artistry in
horrors, and at any rate should be credited
with being the first and greatest in her own
particular line; but her works were vul-
garised and almost smothered by a swarm of
feeble imitations with none of her redeem-
ing points and all of her weak ones exag-
gerated. These are the fallacies —the over-
done coincidences, the mawkislmess, the'
sweeping sensational improbabilities, such as
strangers at first sight of one another gush-
ing into long accounts of their past lives —
that come under Jane’s young lash here. For
instance, in “Love and Freindship,” when
Laura first meets Sophia: “We flew into
each other’s arms, and after having ex-
changed vows of mutual Freindship for the
rest of our lives instantly unfolded to each
other the most inward secrets of our Hearts.”
Such a sentence would be rather pointless to
those unfamiliar with the absurdities she is
castigating. Then the heroines’ husbands
meet, and the transport of the scene brings
this particular letter to a close. “ ‘My Life,
my Soul!’ (exclaimed Edward). ‘My ador-
able Angel!’ (replied Augustus), as they
flew into each other’s arms. It was too
pathetic for the feelings of Sophia and my-
self we fainted alternately on a sofa.
Adeiu.”
The most amazing thing in this century-
old satire on forgotten fiction is its modern-
ity. Chesterton calls attention to one pose
popular with its young people—“their glori-
fication of ingratitude to parents, and their
easy assumption that the old are always
wrong.” That rather takes the wind out of
the sails of Bernard Shaw and his disciples;
they are not, as they would like to be, the
• first that ever burst into this particular sea
of rebellion and defiance. And one of those
fathers of 1792 replies to a youthful rodo-
montade as he might in 1923. “Where,
Edward, in the name of wonder” (said he)
“did you pick up this unmeaning gibberish?
You have been studying novels, I suspect.”
Among many “ageless” bits, there is a refer-
ence to certain Exalted Creatures who
“scorned to reflect a moment on their
pecuniary distresses, and would have blushed
at the idea of paying their debts,” that could
fit into any novel touching on Bohemia,
from Murger to Compton Mackenzie. Again:
They said he was Sensible, well informed and
Agreeable; we did not pretend to fudge of such
trifles; but as we were convinced he had no
soul, that he had never read the sorrows of Werter,
and that his Hair bore not the least resemblance
to auburn, we were certain that Janetta could
feel no affection for him, or at least that she
ought to feel none.
Let us replace the “Sorrows of Werther”
with “Jean Christophe,” and substitute for
the hair criticism the horror, say. that he
not only wears a moustache but does not
even clip it, and the condemnation is not
of vesterday, but to-day. “Love and Freind-
ship”' reaches a tragic denouement in the
violent death of the two heroes before the
eyes of their wives; the two heroines, who
are properly afflicted :■ —
Sophia shreiked and fainted on the ground—l
screamed and instantly ran mad.... For two hours
did I rave thus madly and Should not then have
left off, as I was not in the least fatigued, had
not Sophia who was fust recovered from her
swoon, intreated me to consider that Night was
now approaching and that the Damps began to
fall.
“The History of England” was evidently
undertaken on some bored impulse of self-
amusement, “meaning by it only to vent my
spleen against and shew my Hatred to all
those people whose parties or principles do
not suit with mine, and not to give informa-
tion.” It is perhaps less worthy of preserva-
tion than the rest of the book ; but it con-
tains such cheerful disposals of difficulty as
“During his reign, Lord Cobham was burnt
alive, but I forget what for.” “It was in
this reign that Joan of Arc lived and made
such a row among the English. They should
not have burnt her—but they did.” “One
of Edward’s Mistresses was Jane Shore, who
has had a play written about her, but it is
a tragedy, and therefore not worth reading.
Having oerformed all these noble actions,
his Majesty died.”
Lovers of Jane Austen will be interested
to discover many hints and forecasts of her
later brilliancy, including a faint sketch of
the famous passage-at-arms between Eliza-
beth Bennet and Lady Catherine de Bourgh.
But, as is shown by a reference in a letter
to her sister 22 years later, the fragments
collected in this little book were regarded as
a family joke, written simply and solely “for
fun”; and so they may be read. Only one
character —the shadowy figure of Eloisa —is
rather out of the- picture, as she is genuinely
pathetic. Her inimitable sister, speaking of
the grief of Eloisa, whose sweetheart was
thrown from his horse and killed just before
their wedding day, evidently feels this, and
says wonderingl.v: “Poor girl! She still
laments his Death with undiminished con-
stancy, notwithstanding lie has been dead
more than six weeks; but some people mind
such things more than others.”
ELSIE COLE.
The Story in False Whiskers
Do Australian writers find they have to
cut their short stories about to get a hear-
ing in London? The demand is enormous,
two editors and one agent having lately
declared, quite independently of each other,
that it cannot possibly be met with the
good stuff available. Says one editor: “If
you see poor stuff printed occasionally,
don’t think my judgment is failing. The
magazine has to be filled somehow.” It
is an ingenious excuse, calculated to cover
any reasonable number of misfits. A lot
of rdbbish does see print in England. The
crowd that bases itself on A. A. Milne and
Dornford Yates is going to be pretty awful
to read. And in the November Windsor one
Iv. R. G. Browne had an almost slavish
imitation of Wodehouse. A literary
“school” is a dreadful thing—for the reader.
But it seems that editors demand, for
filling the yawning gap, stories only of a
cheerful kind, preferring the conventional type
where a man and a girl, after eight pages of
either “chaff” or adventure, finish as an
engaged couple, even though they have just
met for the first time. Acute psychology
is unpopular, and gloom is barred. So now
is the frank display of passion lately con-
spicuous—almost a necessity—in popular
novels. In the Middle Ages—w'hich knew
best —that kind of thing had to be short, and
by preference humorously treated. To-day
it has to be long and in deadly earnest.
But never gloomy. Several of the best
English women novelists, being inclined to
look on the gloomy side of life, say that
London editors turn down their stories for
that reason, though they find ready ac-
ceptance in the magazines of the U.S.A.
Meanwhile the rank-and-file of American
writers are rushing to fill up the vacancy
in London. But—and this is the point with
which I began—these unhappy Americans
have to submit to having their stuff cut
about in a pretence that it is British-made.
The editors, who ought to know, seem to
have a new theory that English people don’t
wa nt to read about anything but themselves,
The result is a half-breed yarn rather
pathetic to anyone who pays it the compli-
nient of analysis. In the same Windsor, for
instance, is a quite good yarn of regulation
Yankee type, by one Harrison Rhodes, of
familiar wealthy young American club-
lounger who, being challenged, buys up and
runs a number of factories successfully,
mar rying a working-girl and living near his
WO rk, looking “dangerous and entirely com-
patent, a s if his stern grandfather had come
Utterly American is the idea of
a gjjded youth sliOAving his breed and his
manhood by making a sudden success in
commerce. Utterly American is the talk :
concerning a judge of beauty, for example,
that he is “ so £, e fair picker » j A nd yet all

Comox gives to the
Village Blacksmith
a wonderful new power
seems a curious word to use for a blacksmith’s shop, and yet it is hardly a misuse of
the term. 1 here is, nowadays, as remarkable a success in the repair of injuries to inanimate things
as of those to the human frame. Science has done that.
In former days, when a man was badly injured, he received the crude ministrations of well-meaning but
unskilful practitioners. If he was hurt beyond the narrow limits of their aid, usually he died—elimin-
ated because of the ignorance of the times. Science progressed, and now the surgeon can reclaim a
sufferer maimed or mutilated almost beyond belief.
Science has reached a similar goal in the case of colossal or infinitesimal pieces of metal which happen
to break or become worn. Formerly a crack or break in metal parts, tools or utensils meant the end
of their life unless fire welding or riveting could give them a small extension of usefulness. But to-day,
a Comox Welding Plant in the hands of an operator possessing no greater technical skill than the
Village Blacksmith provides the means for repairing all broken metal parts and appliances—quickly andi
more cheaply than is possible by the old methods.
Oxy-Acetylene Welding is effected by fusing the cracked or broken area or part to be joined by means
of intense heat. The weld is a perfect fusion of the metal to be “healed,” and the metal becomes as
strong at the join as at any other part.
Any household metal utensil or appliance— any metal part of a motor car, such as gear or crank case,
differential housing, channel frame-—can be repaired for a trifle compared with the cost of replace-
ment, likewise any broken parts of farm implements, while in general engineering practice, shipbuild-
ing, steel and iron work and mining operations, Oxy-Acetylene (Comox) Welding is firmly established
as a tremendous power for economy.

These Smiling Shavers
Now honestly, when you shave, do
you have a silly grin on your face-
like a boy who is told for the first time
by a pretty girl that he has lovely eyes?
I have had a lot of trouble that way
with artists. Their only conception
of registering satisfaction seems to
be an idiotic smirk. So I have given
up this obvious way of illustrating a
shaving cream advertisement.
At best, shaving is a serious per-
formance. It demands mental concen-
tration rather than blithesome vacuity.
What Mennen Shaving Cream does
is to get rid of the pain and pulling and
meanness. It takes all the fight out of
your beard and enables you to remove
it instead of hacking it off.
Becauseit doesn’thave to be rubbed
in with fingers and contains no free
caustic, it never irritates your skin, and
your face feels wonderful afterwards.
Everyone who has tried Mennen’s
thinks it’s great. I know you will, too.

VARIOUS VERSE
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
The Side-track.
Here winds the grey road over hill and
hollow,
The hard road, the high road, the road I
shall not follow;
For the by-road, the sand-road that was no
road last week
Is nosing for the bloom of dreams that I
have come to seek.
The grey road finds a market-place, a tavern
and a stable,
And there are flagons in the vat and capons
on the table;
But the morning magpie whistles by the
sand road in the thistles;
There are flannel-daisies springing from th«
brown, untended loam —
Oh, the grey road seeks adventure, but the
sand-road leads me home.
And should I love the grey road less?
It has mothered a path in the wilderness;
And when the sand-road, puppy blind.
Has grown to sight, shall its wise ruts find
A place that all grey roads make kind?

DAVID MCKEE WRIGHT.
Eyes o’ Dusk and Lips o’ Dawn.
Ah, you are tall and slim, Ninette!
The grace of some high minaret
Is in your poise; and when you walk
It seems a thousand zephyrs sway
Your gracious form. And yet
How frail your tiny hands and feet, Ninette!
The crimson flower of laughter, on your lips
Bids love begone. My fond tongue trips
And falters, and my angry heart grows sad.
What use? I, too, must laugh.
Because I understand ? Ah, no !
Because I would that you should deem it so!
Once—but this is a dream, Ninette —
A woman stood as the young sun set;
Dusky hair to her dimpled knees,
Where the gold sand flowed to the dim green
trees,
In the first rude home of man,
Eyes o’ dusk and lips o’ dawn,
Soft and fleet as the slim-flanked fawn
That from my swift spear ran.
Long and long I had loved her well ;
Like the sting of salt to a new-made wound,
Like the passing sail to a soul marooned,
Her mocking laughter fell ;
Till, sick and fierce from the empty chase,
1 caught her close in a sw r ift embrace.
All would I take for my long desire
(Fettered flame holds the fiercest fire) ;
But she raised her face till our hot lips met,
And the face —the face was yours, Ninette!
Alas for dreams! Your little feet
Are all too frail, your hands too sweet,
To bear the shame of my rude touch ;
I am grown weak with loving over-much!
Yet, Eyes o’ Dusk, for that first sunset,
Where the sands of gold and the dim
met,
Does there lurk no shade of an old regret?
Ts it just a dream that I can’t forget?
Ninette! Ninette!
QUEENSLAND.
L. N. CHRISSEN.
The Last Hope.
I have grown tired of star-courting,
I have unhoused the lance :
A prince, a slut to-day can fling
My pride a haughty glance.
What odds? I have grown tired of every-
thing
But chance.
There’s wine for babes and milk for men—
Maybe, or none for none ;
The buried pod may feed a hen
Or, towering in the sun,
Old deathless branches sway when pride and
pen
Are done.
My plotted ardors have gone wide;
Their petals cut with sand,
My garden blossoms choose to bide
On any but my land ;
The things I do most love do most deride
Command.
I would have hunters galloping
And drink wine in the sun ;
Some spirit on a vulture-wing
Left the stall-latch undone;
Therefore, I have grown tired of everything
But one.
Tell out your boasts of mastered fate,
O youths, proud overmuch ;
I scramble through the dark scrub, late,
No stars nor lamps nor such ;
Still I rnav stumble upon doors that wait
My touch.
Dark doors that open to my key
Of faith in what they hide ;
There’s music, fire and wine, maybe
Laughter and love beside,
When they in the slow warmth of revelry
Swing wide.
I’ve seen the sluggard in his luck,
The traitor in his crown ;
Fortune, the mad hag, runs amuck,
And who can stalk her down?
Out of what pits of ordure shall men pluck
Renown?
Out of what pits will she upstart—
She in her proud affright
To break my pride with Love’s desert?
To-day? This instant night
Will my eyes meet her eyes that burn my
heart
With light?
I've watched mad couples wayfaring
Down tracks of circumstance;
Winds, loaded with witch-laughter, bring
Curses on elves that dance.
Therefore I have grown tired of everything
But chance.

IS AUSTRALIA DYING?
“In the youth of a State, arms do flourish ; in the
middle age of a State, learning; and then both of
them together for a time; in the declining ages
of a State, mechanical arts and merchandise.’’
When Bacon made this generalisation it
was so palpably true that his detractors no
doubt accused him of losing his capa-
city for original thought. All through his-
tory the nations that were destined to do
anything of worth—/the vigorous and healthy
nations—had grown like healthy trees. Eng-
land, for example, had got over the first
stage, and was in the glorious midst of the
second when Bacon lived. Whether it
is now entering the fatal fourth class or
struggling back to the third, in which it
held a dominating position before the World
War, will probably be disclosed within the
next year or so. At present the omens are
not good. But what would Bacon and his
contemporaries have to say of Australia if
by some miracle they could be brought here
from that Valhalla in which the great minds
of the past abide? As a State we are break-
ing every rule of caution and commonsense
laid down by 5000 years of history.
It is a symptom of the pathological trouble
which afflicts this country that most of its
growths have been unnaturally rapid. A
decade ago we had no navy, and an army
that Avas hardly big enough for ceremonial
purposes. The end of the Avar found us with
a fleet capable of accounting for that- of
any European Power in the Pacific, and an
army bigger than Britain’s pre-war Expedi-
tionary Force. It was only by chance that
our 1918 army was composed of men who
had seen active service: if there had been
no war, and recruiting for the C.M.F. had
proceeded according to the Kitchener
schedule, the national forces would ha.e teen
at least as big numerically as the A.I.F.
The difference between healthy defence move-
ments such as that of Britain and unhealthy
ones like ours is that the former maintain
their standard while the latter fall below it.
The one lives and the other des. The Brit-
ish Army is not what it was during the
war, but it is still capable of attending to
the interests of the nation abroad and mak-
ing invasion a practical impossibility at
home. The navy has been drastically cut;
but assuming the AVasliington Treaty is , ati-
fied, it will still be the strongest, individu-
ally, in the world. Both the R.A.N. and
the C.M.F. came into the world with a wast-
ing disease—politicianitis. They began to
fade away in the feeding-bottle' stage, and
are now, to all mtents and purposes, dead.
But, it will be urged by the A.L.P. pacifist,
tins putting aside of the evil gods of strife
is a sign ot righteousness and an emblem of
hope; Australia’s present renunciation of
the past ideals of Australian Labor is a
proof that it has entered upon the second
phase mentioned by Bacon ; the democratic
Policy of free, compulsory and universal edu-
cation has brought the age of learning upon
us with a rush. Australia certainly has
plenty of learning in bulk. But of what use
is culture unless the effect of it is to make
a people cultivated? The learning which is
retailed by innumerable teachers all over the
Commonwealth is advancing the nation, as
a nation, no more than some new toy or
game designed to give amusement to people
of all classes, ages and sexes. In one sense
it is doing actual harm —in burdening the
State with an army of incompetent doctors,
lawyers, architects and the like, and thereby
robbing it of a useful lot of plumbers and
bricklayers. Meanwhile, for learning as it
was understood in Bacon’s age, the age of
Siiakspeare, Ben Jonson and Milton,
of Coke and Crewe, of Raleigh and the rest
of the explorers, there is no enthusiasm what-
ever. An actor produces a fine play finely,
and is rewarded with empty houses. A gang
of illiterates get together and import Yankee
eroticism, Yankee crime and Yankee senti-
ment by the mile in the form of Los Angeles
films; the pictures are interpreted in the
.iargon which passes for English in the
Boweries and ghettos of the U.S.A., and our
people crowd to see art and the language
murdered to the tune of over 12 million
attendances per annum. England has the
film habit, but it pays to see British and
Continental films as well as Yankee ones,
and by fairly general consent its dramatic
school holds first place in the world to-day.
Our courts are beginning to reflect the
ethics and the culture of our theatres. They
were models of discipline and good behavior
under men like Stephen and HiginbotiiaM',
Daeley and Mapden, even where they were
not conspicuously brilliant on the mental
side. To-day we have Keystone Judges
struggling absurdly to cope with Bill Hart
counsel—oafish, blustering fellows, deter-
mined to win their way to a big fee and a
loud press-notice whatever their clients and
the more reputable members of the profes-
sion may think or say of them. And then
there is our press—the first-born, as it were,
of our learning. As it has been shaping of
late it is not even an Australian press. In
its roaring claims to be a reformative and
spiritual force it is a Yankee press after the
debased Hearst model, and it is written
largely in the Yankee language; which is
to say, it is an illiterate press—not quite so
illiterate, perhaps, as its picture-show advts.,
but getting on that way.
* * * •
Mechanical arts and merchandise flour-
ished to an extent during the war, partly
because industry was artificially protected,
and partly because those who did not fight
were eager, for the most part, to make up
for it by working. That attitude was short-
lived. and now a post-war lassitude is upon
us. Thousands of workers who never fought
are resting because their fathers or elder
brothers helped to win the war. There are
indications that we are not even in the early
stages of what Bacon calls “the declining
age of a State.” We either possess or are
known to be capable of producing every-
thing that the world most needs, barring oil
—and oil may be found. We could grow
cotton enough for the Empireand the
U.S.A., which already use 70 per cent, of
their own cotton, are nearing the stage when
they will use the lot. We have coal and
iron in proximity, and lead, copper and zinc.
Yet we are importing, chiefly from the U.S.A.,
an astounding collection of articles rang-
ing from fly-catchers and paper-clips to
£lOOO motor-cars. We are making hardly
anything that we can get someone else to
make for us. According to the Baconian
formula, we not only have reached our
decline, but are some way along the down-
ward path.
When Bacon assumed that States would
continue to develop on orderly lines he d’d
not foresee the arrival of Partyism anv more
than a doctor might foresee that a healthy
lad was going to take to drink. Parliamen-
tarians were Nationalist or nothing in his
day, and the world’s only internationalist
organisation—the R. C. Church —had just
been effectively discouraged so far as Eng-
land was concerned. Internationalism, as
we know it, may be said to have begun with
Party Government. Walpole, Fox and
their successors found out that Sympathy with
the foreigner could be made to pay politi-
cally. With Cobdenism a powerful section
arose which was anti-English as a business
proposition. However, while the British
began to import their food, they never got
down to importing their defence or their
literature, and they continued to make an
enormous number of things, most of which
were the best of their sort obtainable any-
where in the world. The basic cause of the
perilous position in which Australia firds
itself at the present time is Party Govern-
ment in the hands of politicians who are
in the business for what they can make out
of it. The local navy and the C.M.F. have
never been approached from a national
standpoint. The Liberals began opposirg
them because Labor had made them a plark
of its platform. Only by stern economy
could the nation afford to develop them—
that principle was laid down by every
authority, naval and military, from the
beginning—and economy is alien to the Party
system. The final calamity came when the
war threw forward W. M. Hughes and his
army of controllers, contractors and poli-
t.cal heelers, each of whom asked no more
for his devotion to the dictator than the
right to start a department. The country
owes so much now that hired defence, or
even no defence at all, is a useful party
cry. A couriiry that has defended itself,
and that then turns to the idea of mercenary
defence, or in the alternative to defence-
lessness, is ripe for the kind of trade exploita-
tion wnich the natives of trop.cal Africa
have known for so many years. And hence
the Commonwealth is filling up with Yankee
bagmen; and their drama and comedy, their
abominable films, and their jokes, idioms
and language are becoming ours. Australia
is not dead yet, by a long way, of course.
But according to every known axiom of state-
craft it is hastening towards the tomb, and
if the worst happens, and it loses successively
its chances of industrial greatness, its
language and its freedom, the verdict of
history will probably be: “Murdered by
politicians, who got their chance owing to
a rotten polit.cal system.”
TWIN SCOURGES OF THE NORTH.
Giving evidence before the Commonwealth
Public Works Committee Professor Priest-
ley, of Sydney Uni., who spent live years at
the Townsvdle (Q.) Institute of Tropical
Medicine, said that he had seen no sign of
physical degeneration or deterioration of
health as a. result of the North Australian
climate. The children “compared favorably
with children bred in any other part of
Australia and Europe,” and there was no
perceptible difference between those of the
first generation of Townsville and the second,
or between the second and third. As for
the men, the Professor was examiner of re-
cruits at Townsville during the war, and
“a finer lot of men than those who passed
through my hands one could not wish to
see.” Those who came from the back coun-
try were “extraordinarily fine creatures in
every way.” Owing to tile unspeakably bad
housing conditions and the lack of domes-
tic help, the married women are much less
robust. But the girl-children, who mostly
live an outdoor life, whereas poor Ma is
cooped up in primitive shacks made horrible
with galvanised-iron, are every bit as sturdy
as the boys. Also, “nearly all the hospital
nurses were locally born and bred, and they
are as fine a lot, physically and mentally,
as one would see anywhere.”
*■ ' • * * »
Another fact that struck Mr. Priestley
concerning the neglected half of Australia’s
heritage was its freedom from Yellow Jack,
blackwater fever, smallpox, bubonic, beri-
beri, cholera, and the like:—
Northern. Australia has an advantage over any
Other tropical country in the relative fewness ot
the diseases affecting mankind. Tropical diseases,
such as are known in the East Indies, are almost
unknown in tropical Australia. S%lafia certainly
occurs in isolated parts, and is bad at times at
Cairns and Darwin,. but it is not a general menace
to health. There is no malaria at Townsville, and
Cairns could be freed of it. I do not think the
hookworm will ever be a serious menace; it is easier
to control than any other condition one has to con-
tend with. I do not consider that, even with an
increase of population, disease will seriously increase.
The diseases are not in the countrv, and if intro-
duced they can be stamped out.
The Professor might have truthfully added
that the North has only two real pestilences
—the southern politician and the southern
official. These scourges have been endemic
since 1911 and are apparently ineradicable.
They have a trick of neglecting the most
fertile parts of the country and concentrat-
ing on the most inhospitable. Their ravages
are especially noticeable at Wyndham
(W.A.), where the Perth Government built
meatworks at three times the estimated cost
only to shut them down after one season, and
at Darwin, where a swarm of directors
were appointed to direct things which have
no corporeal existence. Other distressing,
effects in the N.T. are an establishment
which costs nearly three times as much as
the revenue, experimental farms which pro-
duce nothing but loan-flowers, and half-a-
dozen Government pubs, which declared a
net loss of £7613 in one year. (Incidentally,
the caravanserai that returned the biggest
deficit, £2955, was promptly leased to a
local man for a £2500 ingoing and £8 a week
for 10 years; another, with a Government
debit balance of £llO5. was let for the same
period at £lO a week and a premium of
£3500.1 The diseases are likewise charac-
terised by a mania for sending cyclists and
other wandering persons through the stricken
country; for assessing and trying to collect
taxes from Melbourne; and for encouraging
the inhabitants to labor with a good heart
by offering them free passes to other parts
of the Commonwealth. Always active, more
or less, the maladies rage most violently dur-
ing the borrowing season. When ILondon is
having its ear chewed they are ant to take
freakish forms.
* • * *
A typical aberration is reported from
Perth. In that city there is a lordlv Depart-
ment of the North-West, composed of a
Minister who has made one sea-trip beyond
Capricorn, a Protector of Aborigines who is
popularly supposed to have never seen an
abo. until a few years ago, and the custo-
mary flock of city clerks and typists. This
comic concern was an improvisation of Pre-
mier Mitchell’s after an intrepid voyage
(his first) to Port Iledland. It is entrusted
with the destinies of a province as large as
France and Germany rolled together, which
province, by the way, half the Cabinet Min-
isters and three-fourths of the legislators
have never seen. Someone suggested to the
one-trip Minister that cotton might be in-
duced to bloom in North Westralia, and in-
dicated Derby as a likely spot. Nothing is
more alluring to the average Australian poli-
tician than the idea of opening a new loan
account, so that unfamiliar plants may be
grown where they never grew before by
men who have never grown anything in their
lives. After calling for his atlas to assure
himself that Derby was in Westralia, and
not in Senegambia, the one-trip man decided
that it should be done. With all convenient
speed plants were ordered from Queensland,
a scheme was drawn up by the State wheat
expert (or it ma£ have been one of the Gov-
ernment vets.), and it was arranged to pay
“sustenance” to the growers’ wives; there
being no accommodation for women in the
little West Kimberley port. Then 30 re-
turned soldiers, selected in Perth by the
aforesaid Protector, were rushed up to Derby
(it is 1621 miles from the capital) with in-
sauctiohs to rear cotton so extensively that
the bursting of the bolls would be mistaken
by passing steamers for the continuous
popping of corks. Nothing more was heard
of the enterprise till a man from the Empire
Cotton-growing Corporation—-he used to be
Director of Agriculture in Bengal—dropped
in at Perth and was persuaded to visit
Derby to see whether it didn’t remind him of
New Orleans. This is what he said when
he returned:—
It is just as well to put the men out of their
misery. They were established on a red, sandy
soil called pindan, which has no subsoil, is non-
retentive of moisture, and does not appear to be
very fertile. There is no chance of growing cotton
on pindan unless you manure very heavily, and it
won't pay to manure. Another thing is that the
men started too late, and the district is only on the
fringe of the monsoon region. Not a single plant
I saw will even flower this year. There are black-
soil areas which are suitable for experimental work.
In my view, additional exploration of the area
further north will show a much more regular rain-
fall and much better soils. But the first thing for
the Government to do is to prove that cotton can be
grown.
So another £6OOO or £7OOO of loan money
goes to join the losses on the Wyndham
meatworks and the Marble Bar railway, both
Perth political jobs. North Australia is a
great country, but the ignorant southern
legislator and bureaucrat have done their
best to destroy it. Until it is delivered
from their baleful imbecilities it will never
have a chance.
PLAIN ENGLISH.
The Government and the North.
Prime Minister Bruce, dealing in his semi-
policy speech with Australia’s biggest and
most vital programme, said: —
When the Government’s policy was announced it
would declare the action to be taken in regard to
the Northern Territory and its development, which
must be based firstly on the pastoral and mining
industries, and improved transport by means of some
railways , and the development of roads and stock
routes.
In reality the case isn’t one for “some rail-
ways”—say a shovelful or so—any more than
the Prime Minister’s wardrobe is a case for
‘ some clothes” —a peck or two of “slops.”
ordered by telephone from a Port Melbourne
shop which does a large trade in “ready-
mades.” Some of the matters at issue are
these:—•
If a line is drawn across the continent from, say,
Rockhampton to Geraldton, our claim to everything
above it, save a thin east coast strip, is liable to
be called in question for lack of effective occupation,
as the Dutch claim was called in question by our
off-hand British ancestors.
Over half-a-million square miles of this area—a
region nearly six times the size of Mr. Bruce’s
State —is under direct Bruce control, and is a direct
Bruce responsibility—the largest one he ever had.
The question of White Australia must be argued
there to a finish; also the question of the white
man’s capacity to work north of the tropic line. This
capacity some people flatly deny because Australia
doesn’t plant a State or State capital or any other
sign of official possession there. This involves our
right to shut out our colored fellow-subject
as well as our miscellaneous tinted brother.
There are white men’s capitals and political
centres galore in the tropics, and even the British
Empire owns one of two, such as Salisbury, Living-
stone and Windhoek. But there are none in Aus-
tralia, though this country talks “white man” ad
nauseam.
The great North, can’t be redeemed by city men
throwing it casually, by word of mouth, a few rail-
ways, roads and stock routes.
What the Territory wants, to begin with, is what
S. Australia was guaranteed in black and white, and
what it paid for with the most lavish land-grant on
record -the South-to-North railway. Then its whole
outlook would be revolutionised, for its roots would
be in Adelaide and Melburne, and it would draw
its population and ideas and guidance from these
sane and civilised centres. And the North’s dis-
tance from big white populations would be diminished
by the railway, very much when measured by miles,
and 971 per cent, when measured by hours.
If it is anything at all this is a sober, busi-
ness-minded Government. And to that sort
of Government a contract must be a serious
matter; for there can be no sort of credit or
confidence where obligations are not honored.
Looking at the matter only from that point,
the agreement with S. Australia to build
the direct North-and-South railway must
be carried out. Other lines there doubtless
will have to be; but that is the one with
which a start must be made. Our honor and
our credit require it.
—" •
And this is a Democracy!
N. S. Wales, which imagines that it governs
itself, was supplied with a new Premier one
recent night. He won’t assume office im-
mediately, in which he resembles the Presi-
dent of the U.S., who is chosen in November
and takes over the job in March. But when
Labor gets another turn of power, which
it can hardly help doing, it is enacted that
Gregory M’Girr is the man. About 30
officials, not members of Parliament, and
not elected by the people, and unknown
even by name to the vast majority, met in
secret or murky conclave (the press is.
never admitted), and appointed Gregory
leader, for reasons not stated. These things
are known of the prospective Labor Premier:
(1) He is an exceedingly rich landlord. (2)
He was Minister of Health and had only one
serious job to do during his term of office.
That was to put in operation the new law
making syphilis a notifiable disease, as it
had long been in most up-to-date countries,
but not in dirty N. S. Wales. Gregory's
attitude was that he was a contemptuous
law unto himself, and the statute wasn’t
enforced. (3) As Minister for Motherhood
he lived for two years on the credit and
glory of being the man who was going to
establish Motherhood Endowment, yet the
big smiling bluff was too lazy or too incom-
petent even to write out the Bill —at least
some of his colleagues said so. (4) He was,
unless appearances conspired unanimously
against him, a disloyal and treacherous col-
league, and the eternal M’Girr-Dooley row,
with McTiernan and others in the distance,
made the Labor Cabinet a bear-garden and
an obscene jest. Nothing else is known in
the new leader’s favor. For the moment,
of course, there are, or were when this was


written, two N.S.W. Opposition leaders—
Dooley, chosen by the members in 1 arlia-
ment, and M’Girr, chosen by the •‘t'xecut.ve
outside consisting largely of baffled appli-
cants for membership. The possession ot
the official room, with the extra allowance
which belongs to the leader, is left to be the
subject of a comic cat-fight between the
parties. It may yet be necessary to. enact
that the people shall elect the Premier for
a fixed term, and that he shall select the
Cabinet. When the owner of the house-
the man who pays the rates and expenses —
can’t sleep because of obscure dogs fight-
ing for the bone of contention, he is liable
to become wild and throw the bone into the
sea.
The County Council Red Herring.
Mr. W. Green, of Tamworth (N.S.W.),
holds forth again (his paragraphs have been
numbered to get things shipshape) :
(1) You bally well don’t know what you’re talk-
ing about. You say (referring to the evils of cen-
tralisation and rural stagnation): “Separation proved
very beneficial for these evils in the cases of Maori-
land, Tasmania, Victoria and South Queensland.”
Let us consider Maoriland first. Where is the
analogy between that country and N.SfW. ? Has
North New Zealand separated from the South ? Or
is there any desire for Separation or the creation of
New States over there? Apparently New Zealand is
satisfied to remain one State and one people.
(2) Then consider Tasmania. Can you or any-
one else quote Tasmania as a great and wonderful >
example of progress? It has the reputation of being
the sleepiest corner of the British Empire. Despite
its lack of progress it has not exhibited a violent
desire to cut itself up into new States. It is a pity
you dragged in Victoria as an example of the advan-
tages of Separation as a means to counteract the
evils of centralisation, for centralisation in Mel-
bourne is just as bad as it is in Sydney.
(3) South Queensland is a better example in sup-
port of your argument. There they have more ports
in direct communication with the hinterland, and
Brisbane is not the bottle-neck through which every-
thing flows. For this you must thank its geographi-
cal conditions, and the fact that it has comparatively
no barrier coastal range making direct communication
with the interior difficult.
(4) I am surprised at your support of the Tam-
worth paper’s statement that the N.S.W. Government
purposely runs the country railways at a loss to suit
the convenience of Sydney. I would like to use
strong language to express my surprise at your atti-
tude. It would be interesting to see you defend
this statement, and prove by solid argument this (to
me) startling contention.
(5) The following extract from your comments
deserves careful analysis: “In this country popula-
tion has always flowed to even badly-situated State
capitals, and (save for mining fields which are tem-
porary at best) it has flowed nowhere else.” In the
first part of the above you are putting the cart before
the horse. Originally population did not go to the
capitals. The capitals went to the population, or,
in other words, the site of the largest population was
< hosen as the capital. Sydney would be the same
Sydney had the State capital been at Canberra or
Currabubula. When the Federal capital was estab-
lished in Melbourne did it make Melbourne progress
to a greater extent than Sydney ? Of course the facts
are that since Federation Sydney has progressed
more rapidly than Melbourne.
(6) Despite your remarks re the new population of
the new inland capitals having two legs and a
head, my original argument holds good—the new
settlers to such capitals would be mostly Civil ser-
vants and their servants, and not primary producers.
(7) In the following you have given me a great
opportunity to get a thrust home between the joints
of your armor. You say: “In some States the out-
ports manage their own affairs, which is also a com-
mon habit in the U.K. and elsewhere.” Quite so;
that is just what we want. Local authorities such
as county councils manage and control ports in the
U.K. and elsewhere. When the Southampton people
desired to make a great port they did not first try
to cut England up into new sovereign States. They
got to work and did the. job. And so in N.S.W. to-
day, big things can be done in the way of rural
development, but the people of the country will have
to do them themselves. If they fail it is no good
blaming the Government or the laws. The Local
Government Act, in its provision for county councils,
gives the legal framework necessary for organisation
and administration. If the people are too indifferent
to use this legal machinery, well, it’s their funeral.
In reply, and with an effort to be more to
the point than the haze from Tamworth :
(1) Apparently Mr.. Green bally well doesn't know
that Maoriland, Tasmania and Victoria got separation
from. N.S.W., settled down as manageable self-govern-
ing areas, and appear to be content with the result.
It is to the credit of Separation that they are con-
tent, which Green's unseparated district isn’t, and
that they don’t want to rejoin. Possibly it is one
result of setting up as manageable properties that
these three States, equal to only about two-thirds of
N.S.W. when added together, are more densely popu-
lated than any of the giants. Another result is
that they have so dodged the centralisation curse that
the biggest Australian towns which are neither
State capitals nor ephemeral mining, centres are all
in . these little States. They include Auckland
(157,757 inhabitants), Christchurch (105,670), Dune-
din <72,255), . Launceston (24,318) and Wanganui
(2£,523)-*—four in Maoriland and one in Tasmania.
The Victorian town of Bendigo (25,693) is barred
because ..it still does a little mining. Next are
Rockhampton and Townsville (Q.), which, at least,
have the direct'railway connection with their hinter-
land that N.S.W. ports can’t get, and Ballarat (Vic.),
which miTres iro longer. Auckland (M.L.) is the one
city which is bigger than the local capital.
(2) It is a mistake to give way to superlatives, as
in the matter of Tasmania being “the sleepiest
corner in the British Empire." The best medical
authorities regard this verbal efflorescence as a bad
sign. Sydney Telegraph, on March 8, gave most of
a page to the wonderful enterprise of Tasmania,
which, after a dozen years of struggle, has about
finished the job of supplying enough hydro-electric
power for all its town industries. As the Tele-
graph puts it: “The eyes of the Old World are begin-
ning to look to the Island State.” Incidentally, the
census figures, as far as they have been published
in the “Commonwealth Year Book,” show no decay-
ing towns in Tasmania —no fading places like Armi-
dale, Grafton, Tamworth, Cowra, Inverell, Moree,
Singleton, Casino, etc.
(3) The fact that, while Queensland has four
main lines striking from four widely-separated
ports into the interior, N.S.W. hasn’t anything of
the sort, has nothing to do with the “barrier
coastal range.” The Sydney interests found no
wonderful difficulty in building from the coast to
Katoomba (3335 ft.), but always found a line from
the coast to Armidale (3265 ft.) beyond the wit of
man.
(4) The reason for the statement that some
country lines are deliberately made non-paying by
the city authorities which design and manage them
can be found on the railway map, and on the list
of new railway proposals. Any language that Mr.
Green likes to use on the subject is a matter
between himself and the local police.
(5) A certain languid interest attaches to the
statement that “originally population did not go to
the capitals; the capitals went to the population,
or, in other words, the site of the largest population
was chosen as the capital.” Well, “originally”
the population came to the capital—in convict
ships. But when Queensland, Tasmania and Maori-
land moved their capitals from Sydney to Brisbane,
Hobart and Auckland respectively they were going
away from the “largest population.” The experi-
ment, having been a success, should be repeated.
(6) Blank assertion, whether about the end of
the world, or the existence of a material devil, or
the kind of people, whether Civil servants or tinkers,
who will inevitably monopolise a hypothetical town
or any sort, are ex parte, and carry no weight unless
accompanied by affidavits and a cash deposit. Still,
the statement that the. hypothetical folk wouldn’t
be primary producers is admitted. Primary pro-
ducers, especially fishermen and bee-keepers, seldom
work in cities.
(7) The Southampton folk didn’t, as Mr. Green
remarks, try to cut up England; that place, being
far less in size than Victoria, is cut pretty ‘small
already. The same reticence will no doubt be prac-
tised here when we arrive at States the size of
Britain. The Simple matter at issue is that there
is room in Australia for some plain States, with
powers that can’t be readily taken away from them,
unlike those of N.S.W. country councils, which are
lightly granted because they can be abolished any
day. These are more or less modelled on English
county councils, which look after bridges and main
roads, dogs, armorial bearings, pauper lunatics and
dance-houses, but don’t build railways'or look after
ports. Queensland also has a system somewhat
akin to that of N.S.W., and its local bodies own
scraps of railway, but there is little in the pro-
prietorship of little lines, each with its dislocated
little management, when the big railways are in
other hands, and there is no power to complete the
jobs the other hands won’t finish, or to repair the
blunders they have made. And as the powers of
Queensland’s “county councils” were altered or
enlarged or diminished seven times in 18 years,
they are hardly worth calling powers.
•
The Christian Tyrant.
The Churches have a positive genius for
attaching themselves to causes which are
subversive of liberty. In Italy an R.C.
archbishop has just issued a pastoral extol-
ling Mussolini and Fascism. It may suit
the Italians, as a race, to have freedom of
speech entirely suppressed (there is now not
one anti-I ascist paper in the country, and
the late editors are either in gaol or on the
run) ; to have the national Parliament
emasculated and the authorities of all the
great cities reduced to the status of dummies ;
to have Jews and atheists made liable to
mediaeval penalties. At no period in the
history of Italy have more than a small
percentage of the population known freedom
as we understand it. The success of the
Fascist movement shows that a majority of
Italians now, as in the Dark Ages, do not
consider the thing worth having; and the
Church agrees with them. In the U.S.A.
the Protestant Churches have identified
themselves —at any in the south and
south-west —with the Ku Klux Klan, a
movement which' differs little basically from
Fascism. It is true that the Ku Klux dis-
ciplinarians, instead of persecuting Jews
and atheists, persecute Jews and Catholics.
The Ku Kluxers are sterner in their puni-
tive methods than the Fascists. The latter
appear to have but few murders to their
discredit, most of their corrections having
been applied with cudgels or castor-oil. The
Ivlansmen rely on tar-and-feathering and
lynching, and a case is now before a
Louisiana Court in which pathological ex-
perts have testified that two Ku Klux vic-
tims, Daniels and Richards by name,
“were inhumanly tortured before they were
killed,” The Klan, which is already a more
successful institution numerically and finan-
cially than Mormonism, Dowieism or any
of the other fancy faiths of the home of the
brave and the free ever were, has announced
in an appendix to its just-published Consti-
tution that it will extend its activities this
year to Europe—where, incidentally, it pro-
poses, to seek, the co-operation “of all good,
straight-going, law-abiding, clean-living
Roman Catholics”! And Australia received
the agreeable news, last month, that this
evangel of righteousness without the law
was also to be introduced here. In oiir own
small way we have not been altogether idle.
From time to time items like this are pub-
lished in the daily press:—
At the monthly meeting of the Eastern Suburbs
branch of the Protestant Federation, .the. president
said it was time Prbtestants' stuck together, and sup-
ported those tradesmen living in their districts who
were members of the Protestant Federation. It
was subsequently stated by the president that a list
of those in business in the locality, was to be nub-
lished every quarter, in order that members could be
guided where to do their shopping, and thus support
each other.
The results have to be sought in another
section of the paper. In the Sydney Bank-
ruptcy Court last week John Cash, a
Protestant and a Digger (he joined the A.I.F.
in 1915, was blown up at Bullecourt, and
was wounded and taken prisoner in May,
1917), attributed his insolvency to a boy-
cott by the Loyal Orange Lodge at Thirl-
mere: —-
They boycotted mv store because I wouldn’t join
the lodge." There are a lot of Orange people up
there, and a great number of my customers belonged
to the lodge, and it affected my business very much
when they boycotted me.
Clearly if the Ku Klux Klan does decide to
raise us spiritually by instituting a mission
here, it will find a useful nucleus of dis-
ciple’s in these enthusiasts, who have not hesi-
tated to ruin a very much deteriorated ex-sol-
dier in the name of Christianity. But it is all
directly contrary to the spirit of British
liberty and British fair play. That really
is where Australia’s best chance of evading
the shackles of Fascism or Klanism comes
in. There may be little cliques of ruthless
bigots here and there, but as a whole the
nation distrusts and despises the tyrannical
and devious methods of mediaeval clericalism,
whether it travels under a Dago, Yankee or
an Ulster alias.

The Sydney Council and a Coal-mine.
The passionate desire to buy something at
an absurdly inflated price has long charac-
terised Sydney Municipal Council, and the
“reformed” body appears to be lapsing into
unreformed ways. The old disreputable lot
wanted to pay £70,000 for a coal lease
wincn its experts vajued at from £5OOO down
to nothing. Certain of the new lot want
to pay £lOO,OOO of the ratepayers’ money
for a quarter interest in the suspended con-
cern at Balmain which has the right to dig
coal from underneath Sydney Harbor. The
concern has paid no dividends in its life of
over 30 years. It is, or recently was,
heavily loaded with “6 per cent, first deben-
ture stock” and “7 per cent, income deben-
ture stock,” and odds and ends like that.
The whole concern is said to have been
vainly offered at £70,000. The Council, it
appears, has no legal authority to become
partner in a mine. That difficulty can, of
course, be got over by legislation; but no
amount of legislation can put coal into the
mine if it isn’t there, or improve the nature
of the seams. The main Is. S. Wales coal-
fields are really one. They reach the sur-
face in the north and south, and are furthest
from the surface under the metropolis.
Nevertheless, certain people decided in the
eighties of last century that it would be
a great thing if the coal business could be
brought to Sydney, and then everything
would be there except shearing and rabbit-
trapping, In pursuit of this ideal a start
was made to pile up all the necessai-y black
and dusty and smoky, apparatus on the har-
bor shore near Cremorne, so that the Ma
State’s beauteous gateway might look like
the English Black Country. A Govern-
ment with some shred of artistic sense
warned the vandals off, and they shifted to
Balmain. The excavation went down
2880 ft. before it struck anything, and that
strike was not a great one, and happened
years ago. The Federal Statistician
remarks that the show “possesses consider-
able interest from the circumstance that its
workings are amongst the deepest in the
world.” But depth of seam is no virtue.
On the contrary, it means a continuing ex-
pense for haulage, ventilation and, pos-
sibly, unwatering. It costs something to
haul over half-a-ton of steel rope, without
any load attached to it. But depth and the
overlying harbor mean something else —un-
certainty. With shallow seams underlying
solid earth boring can determine the quan-
tity and quality of the coal at small cost.
No such determination is possible in the
present case. And there is at least a
serious risk that, though coal beds existed
under Sydney Harbor, they are no longer of
anv value in places. North of Sydney,
between the city and the present southern-
most mine of the Newcastle group, pros-
pecting was done 15 years ago; and^ the
coal was found to have been “coked” in
some of those commotions of nature which
have occurred in past ages. The Bulle- •
tin has no objection to the City Council
acquiring a coal-mine for its own purposes;
but when it does buy one it should be certain
that it is getting one; and it proposes to
go to almost the only place where it cannot
be certain whether it is or whether it isn’t.
Judges—Weak and Strong.
The worst type of judge for the commu-
nity’s pocket is the weak judge. Incompe-
tent judges, biased judges, judges with kinks
—there are remedies against all of these;
and. anyhow, the damage they do is confined
at the worst to individual cases, and in
the nature of things it is periodical in its
incidence. The weak judge is a continuing
calamity. He is to blame for a lowered
moral, not merely in his court, but in all
the courts; for methods in the handling of
witnesses which put a premium on black-
guardism; for the stringmg-out of cases (a
convention which frightens litigants who
are not rich out of asserting their legal
rights) and for many other abuses. The
evil that a weak judge does lives after him :
a reputable citizen may be ruined to-morrow
because 10 years ago a judge lacked the
nerve to lay down a certain line of con-
duct as a principle of advocacy. It is easy
to see why weak judges are so lamentably
common. It takes an exceptionally strong-
man to be a strong judge. The counsel
whom he may be required to discipline have
been his co-workers for years and usually
• are still his intimate friends. He may be
related to them. Bench and Bar form a
close corporation, and if these monopolists
of legal wisdom combine to say that injustice
is justice, who is the public that it should
take a contrary view? The weak judge
floats with the stream of his caste, becomes
even more popular than he was at the Bar
—and is despised by the very men who
applaud him. The strong judge battles
valiantly against irregularities, gets little
or no credit from the public whose interests
he is protecting, and becomes extremely
unpopular with a number of gentlemen who
have been accustomed to play golf or bridge
with him. On the other hand they cannot
choose but respect him. As a salutary
instance of a strong judge in action take
Justice Campbell, of N. S. Wales, in the
Myerson libel case last week. Here counsel
for the defendant wanted to put in “all the
applications that had been made against
Myerson in the Fair Rents Court.” Counsel
for the plaintiff was agreeable, though he
estimated that the admission of the records
would lengthen the case by at least a fort-
night. However: —
His Honor: I cannot see that the admission of
the Fair Rents Court records are relevant, or that
i>v admitting them the progress of the case will be
expedited. In my opinion the ingenuity of counsel
is being exerted in obscuring the issue.
Counsel: I hope' your Honor won’t say that.
His Honor: I do say it, and say it strongly. And
I may tell you this also. If you were to talk
from now till to-morrow morning you would not
induce me to change my opinion that those records
are irrelevant.
Because this judge had the moral courage
to say what was in his mind and to act
accordingly, he saved whichever of the
parties is called upon eventually to pay the
costs of the suit about £5OOO. He saved
the public the cost of his own time and
that of the Court officials. He saved the
jury from a fortnight’s needless boredom.
And he laid down the healthy principle that
counsel, no matter how high they may
stand in the seniority list, who in the
opinion of a judge “introduce irrelevant
matter” or “obscure: the issue,” will lay
themselves open to a public rebuke. It is
an unpleasant obligation that would never
have been put upon him but for the fact
that N. S. Wales has been afflicted with a
number of deplorably weak judges in recent
years.
The Return of Dizzy Finance.
It sounds almost like the spacious, adven-
turous days of ’Si) and thereabouts to find
matters like this in the morning paper:—
With the modest eap.tal of £2OOO in £1 shares,
the Primary Producers’ Bank has been registered in
Brisbane for the purpose of carrying on the business
of 'a “bank of issue'’ and all branches of banking
business in Queensland and any other part of the
Commonwealth.
An institution can’t be a “bank of issue”
nowadays in the old sense of issuing notes,
but it can issue prospectuses, highly colored
reports, nicely cooked balance-sheets, and
the like, so the description is technically
accurate. The northern State has now only
one concern left which icas a bank of note
issue. Certainly the late. Premier Ryan
floated himself and some relatives and
friends, but principally himself, into a bank
just before he died, but as he was also on
paper a sawmill, squattage, shipping con-
cern, mine, shop, balloon, farm, whaling
station, factory of all sorts, and things in
general, his company was almost too com-
prehensive to be taken seriously; and, any-
how, it hasn’t banked up to date. There is
also a proposal to put more capital into the
Federal Deposit Bank, formed in 1908 out
of the Federal Building Society and now a
sort of building bank, and turn it into the
real thing, so that the big borrowing State
may be at least a two-bank show; and the
Primary Producers will make three. Pos-
sibly another flutter in banks is impending,
just as there has been a flutter in insurance.
Lately various amalgamations reduced the
number of assurance offices, whereupon a
score or so sets of gentlemen recognised the
void thus created, and organised enough new
insurance ventures to fill it many times over.
Some of them, though not so comprehensive
as T. J. Ryan’s sawmill-bank concern,
appear almost sufficiently widespread to
cover anything from a baby’s life to the
cargo of a gun-running ship. As some of
them have already discovered, there isn’t
room for them all to get enough business to
live upon, but there is room for them all to
dissipate the policy-holders’ money in hunt-
ing for business. Even the most hopeless
concern contrives to get some policy-holders.
A good many years ago the question of exor-
bitant working expenses led to strenuous
action in the United States. The “giants”
of that country had entered on such a
breathless race to “write” the greatest num-
ber of billions of new policies per annum that
working costs went sky-high. They threat-
ened to make an end of bonuses, and of other
things besides. The race was checked by an
upside-down sort of law, which limited, not
expenses, but the amount of new life busi-
ness an institution could take in each year
Two concerns, finding they could get all the
business that they were allowed to take much
nearer home, thereupon lost much of their
pride in certain gigantic confections of stone
and marble which they had put up in Aus-
tralian cities to attract local trade, and the
last of them, owned by the Equitable, has
just been sold to the National Mutual. Those
vast, ornate advertising edifices, which long-
ago ceased to have any value as advertise-
ments, ought to serve as a warning to this,
country, which wants uniform and compre-
hensive insurance and banking legislation as
badly as it wants uniform marriage and
divorce laws —-the insurance law to, among
other things, limit expenses and provide for
Government audit.

The N.S.W. Prison System.
Deak Bulletin, —I cannot refrain from
writing a few lines in response to those of
“2nd Divvy” (B. 8/3/’2B), for one thing
because, unlike him, 1 have been in gaol,
and, for another, because I think that many
of his conclusions as to prison systems, and
particularly those which he deduces from
his visit to Parramatta Gaol —presumably
some years ago—concerning the systems of
the Ma State, are very wide of the mark.
In 1908 I was hired by a London paper to
get myself into gaol, and did five days in
Pentonville. I have, therefore, at least had
an opportunity of seeing what prison life is
like from the point of view of a prisoner. I
saw, previously and subsequently, as a visi-
tor, Dartmoor, Portland, Brixton, and the
ladies’ establishment at Holloway, besides
the military prison in York Castle. In Aus-
tralia, being interested in the subject, I
have often visited the principal prisons ov
N.S.W., as well as Pentridge and others
in Victoria, and Boggo Road (Q.). (It
would be mere discursiveness to mention that
1 have also been over lie Nou, in New Cale-
donia.) Why “2nd Div\ 7 Y” should suppose
that the captain in the R.N. with whom he
visited Parramatta should be a competent
judge of what was or was not “eyewash” in
a convict prison passes my comprehension.
"The ideal of the Government,” he says,
“should be a gaol system wuthout any reti-
cences ; one which would permit the inspec-
tion of gaols and the interviewing of pris-
oners (with safeguards. for the latter
against victimisation) by the nominees
of certain representative bodies at a
moment’s notice.” Well, both these
conditions obtain already. For many
years past—certainly through the Comp-
troller-Generalships of Captain Neiten-
stein, W. M. Macfarlane, Sam McCauley.
D. G. D’Arcy and William Urquiiart—
the policy of the N.S.W. Prison Department
has been one of few reticences, save those
that are in the interests of prisoners them-
selves. (Go, as a visitor, and inquire about
the personality of any Bill Sikes or Nancy,
and see how you will be snubbed!) And
any M.L.A. or any J.P. —who are surely
more or less representative of the com-
munity—may go over a gaol, under the
regulations, at any time in daylight work-
ing hours. So may other visitors reputably
introduced— i.e., by people knowm by good
repute to the Department. What other
"representative bodies” should be allowed
to do so “2nd Divvy” doesn’t say, but he
surely can’t mean, for instance, that the
Prison Reform Society should be allowed to
knock at the gates and go in whenever it
occurs to it to be fitting and appropriate to
pay such a visit? How could any sort of
discipline be preserved in such a case? In
the opinion of the undersigned, the N.S.W.
system is the best in the British Empire—
and I say that from a considerable personal
knowledge, and a pretty wide reading-
in criminology and its treatment. It is
far from perfect : neither is this world. But:

The Man on the Land.
There is a good deal of truth in this :
The writer has lived for the past 50 years among
the men on the land. For the whole of that time
he has heard a chronic growl about the hardships
they endure and the money they are losing, although
he has known very many who have retired in early
life, have lovely hemes and drive their car—all,
no doubt, out of the money they have lost. For the
same period he has heard fervent appeals go up
to the Government to do something for them. Why
don’t they do something for themselves? Men in
other avocations have to “dig in” if they want to
succeed. The man on the land is pampered. He
wants cheap land and the general taxpayer to find
the money to buy it for him ; he wants cheap money
on the everlasting re-payment system. He wants
cheap railway rates and cheap feed to save his
starving stock —which are starving often through
his own neglect. He wants seed-wheat, and sends
deputations to protest u’hen he is asked to pay up
after many days’ grace. He wants pure-bred bulls
supplied to improve his stock, experimental farms
to experiment with every kind of produce he shoffd
experiment with himself. Unless he gets 10s. per
scalp for the dingoes he will let them eat his sheep.
If he has not an army of rabbit inspectors to make
him deal with the rabbits, he will let the rabbits
eat his grass. If something is not done to eradi-
cate the tick, he will let the tick eradicate the cow.
If the shires do not spend a good proportion of their
rates in paying inspectors to make him keep down
noxious weeds, the weeds will keep down the
grass and starve the cow. He won’t test his cows
voluntarily. He forever cries out about the city
agents robbing him of the results of his industry,
ar.d he won’t join a co-operative society to prevent
them doing it. He wants the duties removed from
every article he uses and socked on every one he pro-
duces. He is forever crying out for good roads,
and strongly objects to paying a shire tax to get
them. This country is kept poor by paying' armies
of inspectors to make the man on the land do
things for his own good. He is always holding
conferences about some pest and how to get rid of
it, but never makes an individual or collective
effort to do anything himself. He reckons everybody
else is a parasite, and is fast becoming a worse
one; he condemns State assistance in general and
sits on the Government doorstep asking for it all
the time. One way to improve production from
the land is to leave off sitting on the doorstep
waiting for something to turn up, and go out and •
try to turn something up.
“Lexite” : A Sydney magistrate recently
expressed himself as shocked at being told
by an official of the Sydney Women’s Hos-
pital that it had had 73 cases resulting from
illegal operations in six weeks. It is obvious
th&t. only a fraction of such cases reach
public hospitals; it is only when things go
wrong that the hospital is turned to. Actu-
ally, _ birth-prevention has a great degree of
public sanction; but because of the • usual
unwillingness to look facts in the face, pre-
vention in its worst form—abortion-—flour-
ishes ; and an army of disreputable people,
including a percentage of doctors, wax fat
upon the unsavory business. If a single
Australian hospital has to treat a dozen
examples of the abortionist’s unskilful work
or bad luck every week, how many unborn
are slaughtered yearly? In England a small
body of professional people (Ettie Rout
is active among them) is urging that the
facts should be faced; and they ought to be.
Not till then will we start to thresh out what
should be done about it all.
“Exul” : The Economy Commission wh-eh
recently inquired into the Speck’s public
service made some extraordinary recommen-
dations, but nothing more reactionary than
the suggestion that a Lunacy Act should be
passed on the lines of what it alleges is the
British one. Briefly, it advocates that as
soon as a person has been declared insane
by two medical practitioners his property
should be seized by the Public Trustee, who
would immediately sell it and invest it in
Government securities, deducting 2\ per cent,
of it for his own expenses. The first charge
on the residual income would be the main-
tenance of the patient in a public institution
or elsewhere. Without taking into account
the injustice that might be inflicted in cases
where investments have temporarily fallen
in selling value, and in other cases where
investments are bringing in a better rate of
interest than that afforded by Government
securities, it may be doubted whether there
is a private practitioner in the island with
an expert knowledge of insanity. Many
people with mere temporary mental derange-
ments, not amounting to madness and capable
of cure under appropriate treatment, might
be certified as insane, and, of course, would
have no redress after their discharge. There
is no provision in the island for "this class
of patient. People showing lack of mental
balance, in Hobart, at all events, are put
into padded cells at the General Hosnital
for observation (a cultured woman, a trained
nurse, suffering from the delirium of perni-
cious anaemia, recently was temporarily in-
carcerated i±. one of these), and, if they do
not show s.gns of rapid improvement under
this up-to-date treatment, are labelled insane
and removed to the asylum at New Norfolk!
There is a crying need in Tasmania, as in
practically all the States, for intermediate
hospitals where patients with curable mental
diseases can be efficiently treated, and from
which they can return to their life in the
community without the stigma of previous
insanity attaching to them.
“Bcuragi” concludes the debate:—
Someone, writing from “the missionary’s corner”
(B. 8/3/’23), makes a valiant attempt to show the
inaccuracy of my statements in defence of the early
miners of Papua in their dealings with the natives.
The missionaries’ lecturer, whose statements I
traversed, admittedly had n 0 personal knowledge of
the subject, whereas, if I may say so, I am well
acquainted with the country, the natives, the
miners, and the missionaries concerned. It is no
use being general. Let us take one case—that of
the trouble on the Mamba River, as illustrative of
what really happened between miners and natives.
First of all, my old friend the late Mat Morijton,
R.M., ascended the Mamba and found gold near
Green’s Creek. Clark’s party followed on his
report, and hired natives to tow them up the
river. After some days of friendship, the natives,
who had received nothing but kindness from the
whites, attacked the unarmed party, killing several.
The survivors went down river and met other
parties of prospectors coming up; they all returned,
after sending a cutter to Samarai with the news.
Macgregor, with the Merrie Fngland, was handy,
and went up the river, to find that the miners
had been after the murderers already: He made '
inquiries and arrests. Next year he returned and
left a white magistrate and native police at the
THE CHARGE.
HER HONOR: “And what are all these accused charged with?"
THE PROSECETOR : "Making justice so slow and expensive that we poor people have
little chance of getting it, your Honor.”
junction of Tamata Creek and the Mamba. Green,
the magistrate, went off to clear a site , for Tamata
station, a mile or two away, and was set upon
and butchered, with his police. Next day; a few-
scared miners of the party tried to go down river
by themselves, and were nearly all butchered and
eaten, one old, unarmed' man being killed by
stones and sticks wielded by little boys, then-
elders delightedly urging them on. The great
majority of the miners remained up river, and
neither on this occasion nor on the other, a year
previous, which the missionaries have jumbled
together, did any but a small majority of the men
“leave the river.” The lecturer’s statement that
where white men came blood was shed was
intended to mean nothing but “native blood,” as
the context shows. Yet the advocate now has the
impudence to say that white man’s blood was
meant! The advocate also says there were many
places in New Guinea where the miner could not
go till the missionary had gone first. Well, I
know that no missionaries were on St, Aignan’s,
Sudest, the Yodda, the Gira and the Lakekamu, and
these were the only important alluvial rushes in
the history of New Guinea mining,
“The Deacon” controversially :
Both “Anglican” (B. 8/3/’ 23) and Archbishop
Wright are lacking in consistency. They make
their yearly protest against the defilement of Good
Friday by the rollicking crowds at the Sydney Show
Ground, beaches and elsewhere. But why stop at
Good Friday? Surely. Holy Saturday, to Anglicans
and R.C’s alike, is an almost equally sanctified day!
Christ died, certainly, on Good Friday, but Saturday
was the day after His death ; and it’s a poor mem-
ber of any family who, the day immediately suc-
ceeding a death in the house, would joyously dress
up in glad rags and, with race-glasses swung over
shoulders, start out for Randwiclc, or head for a
parade of prize bulls on the Show Ground. Yet
this is done every year on the day succeeding the
death of Christ, the day when the body was still
lying in the tomb, prior to the Resurrection, and it
is presumably done with the approbation of Arch-
bishop Wright, since no protest comes from him.
“Rio” : Statements of mine that many N. S.
Wales rifle clubmen are over fighting age have
been hotly contradicted by “Pick” and others.
Yet I now find that it is proposed to hold
a veterans’ match, which the Evening News
(5/3/’23) naively declares “will be a revela-
tion, as a large proportion of present-day
active riflemen are men on the far side of
60.” Two riflemen of 90 or over are in-
stanced as still going strong, and there fol-
lows a long list of marksmen in the 60’s,
70’s and 80’s. In other words, men too old
for active service for anything up to 40
years past have been all that time firing away
Government ammunition on ranges and at
targets at the taxpayer’s expense. And their
vote this year was increased, although our
compulsory trainees cannot afford an ele-
mentary musketry course.
“11.L.N.” looks ahead :
After a 600-mile trip down the Murray I asked
myself, “Do Australian Governments know where
the fruitgrower is bound for; or is it just that
they don’t care?” Irrigation settlements are oases
in a dry land at frequent intervals along the river.
Mildura, in her flamboyant prime; Merbein, in the
flapper stage: the toddler Red Cliffs, where returned
soldiers are scratching at the soil —these sprawl
across a few thousand acres of the Victorian bank.
Then comes. N. S. 'Wales’s outlying settlement at
Curlwaa. Once into. South Alls., settlements, old and
young- and middle-aged, push themselves forward,
of hide ■ modestly behind red and yellow cliffs. Ren-
mark, Berri, Waikerie and Cobdogla—‘all are being
boosted with a mighty boost. They look very pretty,
those; of them that are far enough advanced; and
the Governments concerned point with a grand ges-
ture to the number, of farms that have been set apart
ard selected. But what is going to be the posi-
tion in 10 years’ time, when the younger settle-
ments have matured, and the ventures of the Ma
State, on the Murrumbidgee and the Murray and
on the Northern Tablelands and elsewhere, and of
Victoria in the Goulburn Valley, have still further
expanded? There is vague talk of foreign markets;
but how .are we cultivating them? And what are
we doing- to increase the home demand by better
distribution and marketing ? These are "uestions
that many of the more experienced fruitgrowers
are already asking. The policy of plunging blindlv
ahead in the pious hope that all will come right
may not only lead the new settlers to the precipice,
but also undermine the prosperity of those who
are at present sitting behind a payable business.
“Radio” sends a call for enlightenment:—
Shortly after the erection of Australia’s chain of
coastal wireless stations it was a common occurrence
for inter-communication between them all to take
place. Port .Moresby and Geraldton, Broome and Bris-
bane would call each other up. Perth’s signals were
sometimes read at Port Said, and Sydney could
exchange messages with either Perth or Awanui
(M.L.) in daylight. Can anyone explain why it is
that, notwithstanding the installation of the super-
sensitive vacuum valve receivers, none of
these feats are performed to-day? Ten years
ago certain ships on the South African
run, using crystal receivers, could work both Perth
and Durban the same evening, and Melbourne could
“hold” vessels trading round Maoriland for the
full trip. Although fitted with modern apparatus
the same, vessels rarely, if ever, put up similar
records to-day. Is it that the mysteriously excel-
lent conditions for long-distance working prevailing
over the Indian and South Pacific oceans, which
made the Australian service famous for its
efficiency, is disappearing; or must the explana-
tion be looked for in the loss of enthusiasm amongst
the staffs? Whatever the reason, the fact remains
that the improved results expected from the adop-
tion of the costly valve receiving sets have not
materialised. Instead, the contrary has happened.
“Molokihi” (Papua) : The organisers of
the British Pacific Science Expedition now
arriving in Australia appear to be as confi-
dent of success in New Guinea as they are
well equipped with funds. But the failure
of so many expeditions to make good in this
country has been less due to lack of funds
than ignorance of local conditions. The
trouble is that there is no “average” condi-
tion of travel in the Western Division of
Papua. It is quite impossible to take a map
of these parts, mark out distances and plan
one’s progress. Weather conditions are im-
possible to foresee, and weather means every-
thing in a country composed largely of delta
sediment. It is not uncommon for a section
of low-lying country to be turned into a
breast-high swamp after a few hours’ rain.
The writer on one occasion picked out an
objective only 12 miles away, and started
off with the intention of completing the jour-
ney in a few hours. Held up by impassable
swamp and jungle country, impossible to even
cut through, it took him two days to com-
plete the country, and by that time he had
traversed 49 miles! This sort of experience
is liable to be intensified in unknown coun-
try such as the expedition expects to cross,
and as it can be usually laid down that a
Papuan carrier can only carry sufficient
food to last one unit of a party one month,
independent advance is somewhat restricted.
The relay and depot system will, of course,
be attempted, but will certainly prove very
expensive, • and may be subjected to fre-
quent dislqcation. Much time is also wasted
in this Territory in following blind tracks,
and having to retrace one’s footsteps on the
lookout for more favorable ground. As for
river transport, I do not know the rivers
on the late German side of the Main Range,
but I do know that the Fly and its more
northerly bearing tributary, the Alien, end
up in unnavigable rapids. The lower reaches
of the Fly offer better facilities, but when
in flood (and the river is nearly always in
flood) the current takes some pushing
against. I have seen a launch capable of
a good seven knots held stationary for an
hour or so with the engine going full oil
ahead. If experienced Aussies find condi-
tions of travel arduous and often impossible,
what will they appear on closer acquaintance
to explorers from English Universities?
However, if the expedition even covers the
ground proposed without finding a penny-
weight of gold or an ounce of oil, the journey
will be an accomplishment in itself. The
best of luck to them!
From a chemist who wants a war:—
There is an impressive object-lesson for Aus-
tralian politicians in the news that the British Gov-
ernment contemplates discouraging the traffic in
narcotic drugs with £lOOO fines and penal servi-
tude for 10 years. Prior to the war morphinism
and cocainism were almost negligible in English-
speaking countries, but it is officially estimated that
they have increased ninefold since 1914. The posi-
tion is so serious in the U.S.A. that cities like
New York, Chicago, San Francisco and Philadel-
phia are trying the desperate expedient of drug-
addiction clinics, at which the dope-fiend may get
a free issue of his or her customary poison; the
idea being that the underground traffic will thereby
be scotched. The vice has been imported from
America to Australia, along with nigger-dances, crime-
pitchers and the habit of talking Bowery slang
through the nose. Thus far it has been iocalised
in the underworld of the capital cities, but within
the past two or three years it has made disquieting
progress. In public and private hospitals the
patient who is an habitual drug-taker is becoming
numerous. Australia has a variety of Poisons Acts,
which deal with the sale of narcotics in a merely
casual way, and there is a measure passed at the
instance of the narcotic bureau of the League of
Nations, in which provision is made for a special
department to fight drug-addiction. But it is
rarely that a prosecution takes place under one of these
Acts, although the sources of illicit supply should be
easy to detect. Just as malaria overthrew the
power of ancient Greece and licentiousness broke
that of Rome, narcotism is capable of destroying
a nation. There are Americans who fear that it
will have that effect in Uncle’s county, where five
millions, one in every 21 persons, are alleged to be
drug adicts. The Australian Governments have it
in their power to eradicate the scourge from this
continent, and they should attack it relentlessly
before it gets beyond control.


WATER WELL-DRILUNG MACHINES.
There has never been a time when the problem of adequate and safe water supply

For nearly 50 years the Keystone Driller Co. has been in the forefront of manufacturers of

The Keystone Driller is favorably known throughout the world. They

POLITICAL
POINTS
The bosses of the A.L.P. are out with
the statement that they are the hapless
victims of coincidence. They didn’t use
their public authority to “savage” ex-
Premier Dooley for the private end of get-
ting level with the man who described them
as “uncouth crooks.” As a matter of fact,
they had long had a silent eye on Dooley’s
suspicious career in matters of finance, and
it was by mere accident that the eye culmi-
nated, and could keep its peace no longer,
just when Dooley kicked them on the rear
part of their grumpy little dignity. Even
if they said at the time of expulsion that it
was their personal grievance that the row
was about, that only proved that it wasn’t ;
and the fact that the alleged high public
motive was mentioned very late showed
clearly that it had been in view all along.
Which is good news and no end of a load
off the mind.
A possible result of appointing the elder
McGirr M.L.A. as one of the two Popes
of N.S.W. Labor is that the country will get
some return for the £675 p.a., it pays him.
Last session he was so busy buying chemists’
shops and terraces of houses that w’hen he
strayed into Macquarie-street, inadvertently
as it were, somebody called attention to “the
presence of a stranger in this ’Ouse.” On
chat occasion, finding the company congenial,
he stayed long enough to enlarge on the
advantages of a vigorous borrowing policy
to absorb the unemployed and provide every
mother, regardless of color, with an endow-
ment. Then he scampered away to buy
another chemist’s shop.
Another “revelation” in N.S.W. politics
is to the effect that McGirr. apparently not
contemplating a Labor defeat at the last
general election and believing there would
still be cakes and ale, tried, just before the
fatal day, to buy out Dooley’s interest ii?
the Premiership. The chubby leader was to
clear the track by going to London as Agent-
General with a five years’ engagement, and
McGirr was to get a guarantee from pro-
minent Nationalists that, if they came into
power, they wouldn’t play on Dooley the
dor’s trick that his crowd played on Hall
and cancel the appointment. Dooley, like
the one righteous man who wasn’t found in
Gomorrah, bade the tempter avaunt. When
these periodic “revelations” get going they
somehow suggest the case of Mr. Bonfiglio,
hastening to the witness-box to tell the
worst about his ex-wife, and blame her for
the body being found in the Yarra.
Fed-up with the Dead Sea fruit of direct
action, the Queensland Labor Convention
decided, “by an overwhelming majority,”
that industrial conciliation and arbitration
should be a plank in the party platform.
This, although the State Arbitration Court
reduced the basic wage by ss. a week in
March last year. W. J. Dunstan. of the
A.W.U., significantly stated that every
branch of his organisation, except one, had
declared for aroitration and that even the
exception had : mplored the Court to drag it
out of a mess : n which it was involved. The
debate was brightened by the reading of a
letter signed “Jj M. Durkin, Anarchist.” and
containing this gem : “ix>ng before the elec-
tions I hope to be able to establish a Soviet
Republic.” The hopeful young gentleman led
the anti-arb’tration group at the convention
and was will-beaten in December for Mara-
noa, a seai that old Jim Page used to win
hands down.
The tendency of nearly all new laws is to
manufacture new crimes, new officials and
new taxes, but the Volstead Act has easily
secured the record in these respects for the
U.S.A. There are already over 400 serious
offences that may be committed against pro-
hibition, and new ones are being suggested
by the police every day. Thus it was re-
cently made an offence punishable with gaol
to sell or make medicinal beer. Last week
the death penalty was prescribed for supply-
ing wood alcohol, and as medicinal beer is
liable to become wood alcohol in the hands of
an amateur, the electric chair should, in
theory, be kept busy in the coming months.
DROPPING THE PIRATE.
“The Government has undertaken to remove the Commonwealth line of steamers from political
control and to restore industry in general to its pre-war freedom.”
Actually, of course, the only effect of the
new law will be to cast mud at all law.
Meanwhile the costs of enforcing the unen-
forceable are mounting to fantastic heights.
A few months ago Congress was obliged to
vote for prohibition enforcement 1,600,000
dollars in excess of the amount recommended
by its own committee, and 5,000,000 dollars
is now being mentioned as necessary to cope
with sea-smuggling alone.
When the socialisation of industry was
adopted as a pious aspiration by the Bris-
bane Labor Congress, Theodore, the Queens-
land Premier, protested that “you might as
well drop the term ‘Labor’ and call it a
Communist party.” But at the Rockhamp-
ton Convention the other day he offered no
obiection to socialism “by the constitutional
utilisation of political and industrial
machinery,” whatever that may mean. A
day or two later Theodore’s pal, Dooley, the
rejected of the A.L.P. executive, declared
that his bleed ng heart yearned for Sosh. Be-
fore that Dooley had always posed as a
“moderate,” but it so happens that most of
his enemies on the A.L.P. executive are as
hostile to the pink objective as Theodore
was in 1921. Evidently the advice Dooley
got from Theodore when he visited Brisbane
in his extremity was to shout w-th the crowd
that made the most noise. In this case the
Baddeley group.
Replying to Anstey, who submitted the no-
confidence motion in the Reps., Prime Minis-
ter Bruce admitted that the Government
hadn’t made up its mind about many things
—it would have to inquire into them. No
doubt this is quite true. Nearly every Min-
ister has spoken in public about all these
things many times; but for party purposes
you don’t really have to know anything about
a matter —you just spout the party guff. No
more damning confession of the rottenness
of the Present political system could be
made.
These Asiatics who run a Mohammedan
legislature in the cat-and-goat city of An-
g ra are taking strong measures to make
the race increase, so that its military
strength may be kept up. Every male Turk
is to marry at or before the age of 25, and
be the father of anew child at least every
two years for a period which the cable fails
to specify. So when Miss Turk is pro-
posed to she w T ill know what her future life
is to be. And Mrs. Turk, aged (say) 40,
with 10 sons and daughters all under age,
and possibly still owing the State an infant
or two, ought to be a fagged woman. But
the Turkish official is a sluggish creature;
besides, a great deal of immunity can be
bought for 10 piastres, and a piastre is only
21d.
Six months having elapsed since the
N.S.W. Board of Trade created a disturb-
ance in industrial conditions, the Board’s
statistician has gravely presented it with
anew estimate of the cost of living. This
shows an increase from £3 17s. 3d. to
£3 18s. 4d. per week, so there will probably
be a reassessment of the basic wage, and
a fresh rush by unions to gather in a bob
a week extra. The shilling not benefit
anyone to an extent that justifies the cost
of keeping the cumbersome Board, the Indus-
trial Courts and the necessary governmental
offices going; but of course the tribunal, or
whatever it is, must do something to justify
its existence. And meantime the .whole
basis of the “basic wage” remains utterly
wrong, penalising the good citizen with a
large family and offering a bonus to the bad
one who hasn’t any at alh
The argument was advanced during the
Myerson libel suit that a tenant who applied
to the N.S.W. Fair Rents Court to have his
rent decreased should not be liable to have it
increased. No one has yet heard of a barris-
ter contending that appellants before the
Criminal Anneal Court are the victims of
injustice whenever they have their sentences
increased instead of remitted; yet the prin-
ciple is the same in both cases. The Fair
Rents Court has been congested enough dur-
ing its brief life, but if it were laid down
that the tenant, even if he didn’t win, could
not possibly lose, every rent-payer in Sydney
with a day or so to waste would be disposed
to give it a fly, and the business of landlord-
ing would involve the employment of a per-
manent Fair Rents Court agent. Actually,
of course, the place is intended to be a Rent
Appeal Court: in any other capacity it
would be an instrument of oppression and
injustice.
Prof. Coleman P'hillipson, of the Adelaide
Uni., whose specialty is International law,
but who had 15 years at the Bar in Eng-
land before coming to Australia, has spoken
strongly in favor of retaining jury-trials,
which other witnesses before the Law
Reform Commission in S.A. had proposed
to scrap. He sees no “special sanctity’ 7 In
the number 12, but would reduce it to 8
or 10:
Twelve is almost a crowd, and crowd psychology is
a very curious thing. A skilful advocate could in-
fluence 12 more easily than eight. Personally I do
not believe in the necessity for unanimous verdicts.
Only in English-speaking countries are they re-
quired.
But two rows of men sitting in a jury-
box hardly constitute a mob such as the
spellbinder can so easily work upon. The
trouble, generally speaking, doesn’t occur in
the court; it occurs in the jury-room. At
present the fool or the fraud who gets in
there can at least cause a disagreement;
and if he has a weak jury to handle he
can often produce an acquittal—juries
notoriously hate disagreements. The num-
ber of the jury doesn’t matter so much as
that the present requirement of unanimity
should go overboard.
George Moir, head now of the big Croker-
Gillott legal firm, has become leader of the
Federal reform movement within the A.N.A.,
and he may be relied on to take it as close to
unification as he can. The corroboree just
concluded at Bairnsdale (Vic.) reaffirmed
the 191,8 policy—an amendment of our Con-
stitution on the lines of those of Canada and
South Afr'ca. Peacock, Hewnson and
Davine, while favoring “immense” increases
in the powers of the Commonwealth, issued
warnings, but the State fright cry failed
to intimidate the delegates, 66 per cent, of
whom voted with Moir.
Bailey, the A.W.U. boss, who is supposed
to have hatched the plot to install McGirr in
Dooley’s place, is N.S.W. Assembly’s silent
member. He was taunted last session with
having made only two speeches, totalling
1120 words, in four years. Thus goaded,
he stumbled into an incoherent harangue ab, ut
rats, Catts, Hughes’s £25,000 (he suggested
that portion of it had come from Germany),
cowards, robbers, the unemployed, the races,
and “you say that outside and I’ll deal with
you,” which threat was repeated twfice.
Thereupon he relapsed into the calculated
taciturnity which passes with weak-minded
people for sagacity and strength. They
are an interesting study, these dumb oracles
of the A.W.U. Lambert, M.H.R., was one
of them until he wangled himself into a posi-
tion in which he had to open his mouth
occasionally in competition with other men.
That was the end of the Bill Lambert myth.
As regards the alleged Cornstalk lunatic,
over whom trouble has arisen again, one fact
stands out —that the method of identifying
him and rushing him (or her) into the re-
ception-house, which is the first stage to-
wards a worse place, is just the same as it
was in England when Charles Reade w’rote
“Hard Cash” exactly 60 years ago. Appa-
rently it is not only easy to run in a relative,
but a strong-minded and angry man can pro-
cure the prompt arrest of a comparative
stranger, and pay nothing in damages for
his causeless interference. On the other
hand, an impulsive and kind-heartqd Sydney
medico who interfered on behalf of a patient
whom he regarded as wrongly confined did
almost a record fall-in, when costs, ostracism
and organised opprobrium are taken into
consideration.
THE RIVALS.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
Two Popes, you’re probablv aware,
Once squabbled for St. Peter’s chair —
A most undignified affair.
Both claimed they’d been elected fair
And properly and truly.
Each from the job refused to stir
And fastened to it like a burr
Or barnacle. (“Sit tight, McGirr 1”
“Don’t let ’em bluff you, Dooley!”)
Each Pope the other one reviled
And his credentials onkus styled.
Their claims could not be reconciled.
E’en cardinals got fighting wild
And Christendom unruly.
Fraud and imposture sinister
Each prelate would in turn aver.

Anathemas would each intone
To hurl the other from the throne.
Such wild turmoil was never known
As to and fro the bulls were blown.
Each morn they thundered newly
From rival fanes. One may infer
This way and that the wheel would whir.

Both Popes kept laying down the lex
From their respective quarter-decks,

Each carried on without demur.
And things as quaint may still occur
In Labor ranks. (“Box on, McGirr!”

Special depreciation, £4628.. ( a ’ oll •>->,106
The profits in the table do not coincide with
those claimed by the directors. If the pub-
lished accounts could be taken as gospel,
then last year, though costs were on the de-
cline, was not so good as 1920, when the
management was struggling to pass heavier
working expenses on to the public. The
declared net profits for the past three years
have been £49,606, £46,406, £49,485. Addi-
tions to an insurance fund have been added
in the table : 1920, £3375; 1921, £3164;
1922. £8759. Also, for the past 12 months
£4628 “additional depreciation” was allowed
on three new steamers, “having regard to
the passing by Parliament of the statute to
authorise the construction of the North
Shore bridge.” Though the net profit
claimed by the accounts was only £752
more than was taken by the 8 p.c.
div., the larger vote for insurance and
the special depreciation allowance suggest
that existing working conditions have suited
the co. very well. Wages dropped in August
and the 48-hour working week was restored;
also, stores and odds and ends became less
costly. The only concession to the public
was a reduction of subscribers’ rates dur-
ing the last five months of the year. The
insurance reserve additions, at least, can be
regarded as actual net profit earned ; unless
the co. has mended its ways votes to that re-
serve are only provisions against remote
contingencies, and on more than one occa-
sion accumulations have been taken to supply
gift scrip to shareholders. The necessity for
the extra depreciation allowance is also con-
tingent on what happens to this ferry mono-
poly and its assets in years ahead when the
North Shore bridge is completed. There is
not the slightest cause for the co. to develop
cold feet: unless the N. S. Wales Govern-
ment, during bridge construction, spends mil-
lions in opening up new railways and tram-
ways to connect with the city, this ferry co.
will be assured of a big traffic, steadily grow-
ing larger each year, which will not be
affected by the permanent crossing. The
problem ahead of the co. is not what is to
become of the steamers recently added to the
fleet, but the difficulty of providing efficient
services on congested runs now dependent
on ancient Packets which are rapidly quali-
fying for the scrap-heap. If more than the
customary depreciation lay-by is required at
present, it would appear to be warranted
more in respect of the stiff prices the co. lias
had to pay for its recent fleet additions than
to provide for a remote contingency.
Perhaps the heavy cost of the new ferries
has had attention. The published accounts
are not at all informative, and the extent
of depreciation allowances is never disclosed.
In years gone by very much more than neces-
sary was allowed: a succession of Royal
Commissions and the co.’s own reconstruc-
tions testified to that. There is no guarantee
that the management will not repeat its
former practices. When costs were at their
highest fares were adjusted to give 8 p.c.
divs.; reduced working expenditure and
rapid expansion of traffic now appear to
offer opportunities. On past experience the
public cannot expect concessions unless the
co. is forced to make them. Yet there is
one obvious way in which the public can be
protected.. This ferry differs in no way from
the gas cos., which are compelled to submit
detailed accounts. Parliament should con-
sider whether, in the public interest, Syd-
ney Ferries, Ltd., having a practical mono-
poly of a public utility, should not also be
obliged to account for «very penny of its
revenue.
Happenings other than depreciation and
insurance allowances affect d'sclosed profits.
A few years ago a subsidiary—Harbor,
Land and Transport Co., Ltd.—was formed
to take over all interests “not directly con-
nected with the ferry traffic.” Though this
division of the business was claimed to be
some concession to public clamor, there is
not the slightest doubt that the real object
was to mask some of the co.’s operations.
The subs.d.ary publishes no accounts, and
the parent co. does not disclose the divs. it
receives on its £107,000 holding. Twelve
months ago the directors reported that the
subs diary had accounted for two points of
the 8 p.c. div. ; on this occasion no hint is
given of liow much the pup co. contributed.
There has always been, and still is, an air
of mystery about the concern. Under exist-
ing conditions, investors and the public can-
not get a fair view of the business. There is
no necessity for the directors to throw a
smoke-screen over its affairs: several Uoyal
Commissions and Parliament have conceded
the co. the right to pay an attractive rate
of div. and make all the necessary provisions
against wasting assets. If the directors still
entertain hopes of getting more than a fair
thing out of the concern, they may. make a
mess of things.
The new steamers have taken a lot of
cash: in two years, after deducting depreci-
ation, the book value of the fleet has moved
from £286,580 to £429,078. Meanwhile capi-
tal has expanded from £563,852 to £623,327.
Other balance-sheet figures are not of much
interest, owing to the screening of the sub-
sidiary's affairs. For instance, tlie £65,195
owing on sundry accounts shown in the
parent’s latest balance-sheet—double the
amount of two years ago, though £49,089 of
public securities and cash are held—may
include some of the subsidiary’s surplus
funds invested with the parent. It is pos-
sible for the pun to assist the purchase of
steamers for the parent.

At least one-fourth of the profit shown for
the past 12 months came from the produc-
tion of other seasons. At December 31,1921,
the management put a value of £24,516 on
wool unsold; when marketed these stocks
turned in £6975 more. In addition, £3517 was
received from Bawra priority certificates, on
account of 1916-20 clips. The co. did not
include its Bawra interests with assets, and
it still holds 8038 £1 shares which the mar-
ket values at a premium of Is. or so. The
£10,492 surplus from old clips tells what
the wool revival has meant to this co. Every-
thing also went well with the last shearing :
£50,507 came from sales, and the carry-
forward was very small—the current
accounts_opened with unsold wool valued at
only £645. Livestock also contributed £6270
to the year’s revenue. Current production
alone gave profits larger than in any other
year in the co.’s career. Including settle-
ments on account of other seasons, the Profit
and Loss account showed 14 p.c. on capital
after writing off £l5OO for depreciation.
The 10 p.c. div. is the best the co. has
paid. But it is not all it looks: two-thirds
of the distribution (4s. of the 6s. per share)
was a “bonus” which shareholders are re-
quested to regard as a return of capital.
The co.’s squattages comprise 1018 sq. miles
of south-western Queensland leases which
have still about a dozen years to run. So,
besides paying divs., the management has,
during the currency of the leases, to make
provision for a return of capital represented
by wasting assets. Instead of conserving
portion of earnings to set against deprecia-
tion of leases, etc., the directors adopted the
practice of distributing a bit extra to share-
holders, when earnings permitted, as an
immediate return of capital. Since 1912 13s.
per share has been so distributed. No capi-
tal has been struck off, so the balance-sheets
have not given a true view of the co.’s posi-
tion. It is now proposed to put matters
right, and shortly shareholders will be asked
to agree to the £3 10s. shares paid to £3
being written down to 30s. each, and to the
cancelling of the uncalled liability .of 10s.
per share. There is a big discrepancy
tween the amounts distributed as return of
capital and the portion to be struck off.
Possibly something may meanwhile happen
to the £lO,OOO of War Loan held, the £17,000
balance of cash on hand after paying the
final div. and bonus, and the interest In
Bawra. But even if shareholders should
get a bit more prior to reconstruction, they
are still confronted with doubts as to station
prospects _ until the leases run out, as to
probabilities of renewal of leases, and as to
the realisable assets which will remain if re-
newals are not granted. Probably the Co.
has tenant-right in improvements, 'but what
that will be worth, assuming the eo. cannot
secure a renewal of leases on favorable
terms, cannot be measured in £ s. d. at this
stage.

Latest net earnings gave 10-1 p.c. on paid
capital, but the div. rate stays at 0 p.c. so
that strength may be given the young co.
After 12 years fbOOO-odd of profit has been
stored to assist £11,780 of paid capital. The
management does not disclose the extent of
its business, but each year “consistent pro-
gress” or “marked increase” is recorded.
Much of this expansion is not immediately
revenue-producing: the co. has to wait for
its obliging clients to die before it can have
a harvest. So far everything has gone well,
and provided the office-staff behaves itself
and does not misinterpret instructions the
return from the gilt-edged investments in
which funds have been invested should soon
be augmented sufficiently to make better divs.
possible. At December 31 only £7O was
owing to outsiders, and on the Other side
were: Commonwealth and Vic. Government
securities, £14,373; book debts, £199; cash,
£949; office equipment £56. These assets
and £11,780 of uncalled capital—los. per
share on 23,560 shares—and a registered
office which can’t be shifted to Patagonia
are the guarantees which the co. offers to
assure clients that it will be faithful to its
trusts.

Down to 3918 only £146 p.a. went out in
divs. —10 p.c. on £1462 of paid capital.
There was other capital in the business, but
it had been forfeited a dozen years or so
before. At one time the co. was more or
less a co-op. concern, and it played an im-
portant part in improving the distribution
of cow-juice. Very large reserves in relation
to capital accumulated, and most of these
funds went into works extensions. In 1918
the constitution of the co. was entirely
altered, and the reconstruction was followed
a year later by further transfers of reserves.
Additional capital has since been raised, and
balance-sheet figures have moved in this
way:—

Last year’s disclosed net profit, plus unex-
plained additions to reserves, gave almost 14
p.c. on paid capital. Shareholders, however,
received only 6 p.c., so that reserves for
new buildings and plant could be assisted. A
splendid business has been developed, and
evidently the directors see good prospects for
further expansion. New refrigerating plant
is on order, and shareholders were recently
offered 30,000 £l. 8 p.c. prefs. to pay for it
and other extensions.

Since the rubber market crashed towards the
close of 1920, Victoria Malay has kept going
with the aid of £5183 of new • pref. capital
carrying a stiff 20 p.c. p.a. (cumulative),
and £11,900 raised on mortgage. During
the period £2031 was spent on development,
and the production and marketing of
30-t,94oib. of rubber resulted in a loss of
£5747 after making allowances for deprecia-
tion. Lately there has been a gradual
recovery of rubber prices, and there are pros-
pects of this co. showing a fair margin of
profit. Costs, including depreciation, have
been got down to almost 9d. per lb.; the
market has been around 17d. That market
price, however, has been artificially created
by the Malayan Government restricting out-
puts. This co.’s plantation manager esti-
mates that he could harvest 232,0001 b.
for the current year, but its quota—based on
00 p.c. of 1920 output and allowances for
new areas —is only about 150,0001 b. The
bottom fell out of the market at a very
awkward moment for Victoria Malay. Had
boom prices been maintained a little longer,
it would have had approximately £BOOO more
cash to see it through the troublesome period.
At the latest balance the co. was confronted
with liabilities in excess of cash, stocks and
book debts totalling £7197, compared with
£5109 in 1920, divs. are accruing on the
prefs. at the rate of more than a thousand a
year, aud in future that new capital has first
call on earnings before the £30,000 of ordi-
naries can get a look in. The co.’s position
at present is uot uncomfortable, and the
outlook has improved; but the rubber-grow-
ing industry is in poor condition compared
with a few years ago, and only a shadow of
what it was during the boom of a dozen
years back, which prompted all the flota-
tions now glutting the world’s markets.
A mourner at the funeral:—
Investors in the De Garis Kcndenup (W.A.) De-
velopment Co., Ltd., were promised interest at 8 p.c.
p.a. and a 50 p.c. bonus at the end of five years.
It remains to be shown how much less they will get
out of it, the co. having- decided to go into liquida-
tion. The promoter bought Kendenup for £47,325,
and to finance his scheme of development £128,600
was subscribed by the public in first-mortgage de-
bentures. There were also profits on land sales.
But De Claris's ideas soared beyond his means, and
at the end of 12 months Kendenup was in diffi-
culties. Its founder invited the Mitchell Govern-
ment to lend him £30,000 on the security of his
personal assets (among them the play “F.F.F” and a
film of the estate) to meet pressing liabilities, in-
cluding interest on debentures. The refusal was
immediate and emphatic. Then, by arrangement
with debenture-holders, De Garis went to America in
searth of more capital. While he was there the mail
brought him a Royal Commissioner’s report, in
which it was drily stated that his “methods” were
“spectacular and extravagant,” and that he had
been “improvident.” This notwithstanding, he re-
turned to Australia with the glad news that an
American banking co. had agreed to furnish
£275,000 in five instalments of £55,000 each. The
first was to have been made available on Feb. 15.
It failed to come to hand. Another interest pay-
ment having fallen due in the meantime, the co.
gloomily decided to put up the shutters. The
debenture-holders are secured by their first mort-
gage on the “assets, land, buildings, improvements,
etc.,” whatever they may be worth. But all the
settlers have to rely upon is the hope that the
Government will do something for them, and De
Garis’s assurance that he will devote the rest of
life to paying 20s. in the £. As to that, the man
has some excellent qualities, and if it could be
arranged to keep him going on a modified scale, arid
to forcibly deter him from writing and producing
plays, writing and publishing books, and going' hi
for expensive aeroplane stunts, he might yet make
a success of Kendenup. His present unhappy- ex-,
perienee may have given him a truer idea of the
value of other people’s money.

The Equitable Life of U.S.A. is disappear-
ing entirely from the Australian insurance
field, an agreement having been come to
with the National Mutual to take over all
Australian policies and assets. The Equit-
able was the gaudiest of the three ’Murkan
life concerns which raided this continent
in the ’eighties for the purpose of building up
big figures. Gorgeous premises were put up
in Sydney and Melbourne in the boom days,
and they are the principal assets now being
transferred. The Melbourne offices ran into
£090,000, of which £360,000 was for the
site. In the present deal they are passed
over for £280,000. In Sydney the Yankee
hustlers thought they had acquired ths
George-street corner block facing the G.P.0.,
but afterwards discovered that one side of
the £175,000 pile was in a lane, and its
architecture is now admired by the tenants
of the Bank of ’Asia headquarters. The re-
sults of these plunges into classy advertising
buildings have long since been adjusted in
X’l'ork. where a moderately sane insurance
law insists on a regular review of the book-,
value of assets. The Equitable continues
as one of the world’s greatest assurance
offices; its total funds now approximate 150
millions. :.[«X
The withdrawal of U’.S. life offices, and
their flock of “gilt-spurred roosters” —ex-
Minister King O’Malley was one-—was
brought about by U.S. legislation which,
prompted by a crash in the value of securi-
ties there 15 years ago, restricted new busi-

Mount Lyell is making rapid progress with
the preparatory work for its big scheme, the
ultimate objective of which is the treatment
of 130,000 tons ore per month. In about
three weeks the whole of the reduction plant
should be ready for work and be able to
treat about 120,000 tons of Nortih Lyell ore
per month. Allowing for a probable decrease
m grade, this should mean a yearly output
cf about 80,000 tons cormer.
On the strength of the State Mining En-
gineer’s report that prospects are promising,
a London crowd is nibbling at the gold dis-
coveries made last year by the Westralian
State Prospecting Party. The new finds
are in a waterless tract 100 miles beyond
Laverton, and although some assays are im-
pressive, widths are apparently small, and,
according to some experts, values are unlikely
to go down. Nevertheless, as the State
Mining Engineer sees in some of the reefs
similarities fo those in the Edna May group
at Westonia, they ought to be worth a trial.
The Government is sinking wells and cut-
ting a track, so they will probably be tested
soon. Meanwhi'e Perth and Adelaide pro-
moters are already getting busy in expecta-
tion of an early boom.
Hampton Celebration (W.A.) sorrowfully
announces that additional capital is re-
quired to remodel the treatment plant, to
sink the shaft, open up the 400 ft. level with
“possibility of large addition to ore reserves
and water supplies,” and pay off debentures.
A £25,000 debenture issue to meet these re-
quirements is mooted by the Board, but the
terms under which this amount is likely to
be obtained would practically render the
shares of the co., for the time being at any
rate, worthless. The co. has tried to do
its best for shareholders, but luck has been
against it.
Boulder Perseverance (W.A.) is swap-
ping its present general-managers, Hooper,
Speak and Co., for Ernest Williams, a
former manager, who inspected the mine last
year on behalf of some big shareholders and
issued a blistering report on his return to
London. Williams’s arrival will probably
be followed by the old co. coming to life
again and restarting operations on its own
account. Over a quarter of a million ster-
ling has been dug out of the show since the
co. gave up in despair three years ago.
* * * *
For some years Lake View and Star
(W.A.) has been in favor locally, but so
far it has not achieved much in divs. to
justify that good opinion. Ore reserves are
extensive, but the grade is not high. Official
reports are almost invariably modest; they
merely set out ore reserves actually in sight
and gold content thereof. Recently, how-
ever, the outlook has brightened, five feet of
3oz. telluride ore haying been cut at the 1500 ft.
level. During the past six months there
have been several- good developments at
depth in Kalgoorlie mines, but that in Lake
View and Star appears the best. Of course,
permanence of the body has yet to be proved.
Perth Empire Mining Syndicate has 2300
shares all ranking alike; but they are in
two divisions: 600 “A” shares of 10s. each,
and 1700 “B” £1 shares. Of the latter 400
were placed at a premium of £2 and 228 at
a premium of £4. The syndicate has an
option till September over two groups of
leases about a mile apart at Sandstone
(W.A.). Total area is about 100 acres. If
the option is exercised £3500 cash is to be
paid. At least one lode has been located on
each lease, and on one area three lodes are
being tried. Surface indications and develop-
ments during past three months have been
good. On the Grand Slam lease Bft. of two-
ounce ore has just been disclosed down 50ft.
The owners consider that there is now suf-
ficent 25dwt. ore exposed to keep the nearby
State mill running for 12 months.
Values in shafts on Mutooroo’s new area on
the Trans, line become discouragingly less
with depth, and little is now heard of John
Warwick’s early prophecies of a huge high-
grade ore-body at depth. the new
find adds to the list of recent Westralian
disappointments. Hampton Plains, Mt.
Monger, Retaliation and now the Trans,
area—all looked good enough at the surface,
but, so far, that has been their only virtue.
Mutooroo’s boom at Mt. Juglah (W.A.)
having burse, co. promoters hurraed to Gibral-
tar, near Coolgardie, and started to brag
about prospects there. Adelaide promptly
secured options, but for once had the good
sense to get an independent report before
going any further. On receipt of this re-
port it abandoned everything.
Kanowna Red Hill (W.A.) potters along.
It d.dn’t get the gold that flotation
promised, and after one or two disappointing
returns the show was let to trxbutors. Good
crushings which made the co. turn green
with envy followed, and in August last it re-
took possession. Since then the directors’
reports have been mostly about small veins
and'erratic values. Hike many other small
gold mines in the West, the Red Hill is
apparently suitable for a small party wiil.ng
to bog in and fossick here, there and every-
where, but is no good for a co.
Brown’s Reward will probably have an-
other 300-ton crushing ready in April.
Meanwhile lunds are low, and the co. must
soon issue more reserve shares or make calls.
The ore-body is short and narrow, but is
worth 3oz.
* * * *
A Bulletin man revisits Westonia: —
Most of the boom-day inhabitants have gone,
taking their belongings, including buildings, with
them, and all that now remain are some dismal
looking structures and a handful of down-hearted
people. Mining is stone dead, and street corner dis-
cussions on market quotations have given place to
an exchange of opinions as to the best sort of wheat
to grow and how to get loans from the Agricultural
Bank. There is still some unprospected country
on the field, but capital doesn’t seem to have the
pluck to try it. ' A few sporadic attempts are
being made by prospectors, but nothing of any
value has been sighted.
* * * *
“Topee”: The Bellevue, Sir Samuel
(W.A.), the sale of whose plant to Sons of
Gwalia was lately mentioned (B. 8/2/ 23),
had a fairly long run as Westralian mines
go. I knew it, off and on, from ’96 (it had
been working some years then) until the end
of 1903. The refractory nature of the lode
broke many hearts—-among them that of
Koehler, formerly a brilliant Broken Hill
metallurgist. It was remarked at his funeral
that none of the other occupants of the Sir
Samuel cemetery (then about a dozen) had
died a natural death.
• * # *
New Gibraltar, Adelong (N.S.W.), a
resurrection of the once English-owned
Gibraltar Mines, has not fulfilled expecta-
tions, which ran high only a few months ago.
Capital has all been called up, and a somewhat
drastic scheme of reconstruction is proposed.
The co. has 33,300 ss. shares in reserve, but,
seemingly, shareholders who have faith in
the property are not inclined to subscribe
for these and carry on for the benefit of
holders who are not prepared to go further.
So there is to be a new co. in 86,700 shares
of ss. each, to be issued paid to 3s. 6d. on
the payment of 6d. Holders who do not
apply for their proportion will drop out.
Why the nominal capital of the new co.
should be fixed at £21,675, when the callable
amount will be only £8670, is ‘incomprehen-
sible, in view of the stiff stamp duties on
capital issues. This case demonstrates the
anomalous state of the no-liability law in
N. S. Wales. To raise a small amount of
additional capital every formality in the
complicated and costly process of forming a
new co. has to be observed, whereas if the
law were brought into line with those of
other States, a resolution passed by a
majority of shareholders would provide the
necessary increase. Appeals have been made
to Minister after Minister to amend the Act,
but without avail —a mining co. hasn’t a
body to be kicked, a soul to be damned, or
a vote to give or to sell.
Not quite 12 months, ago a little £5OOO
limited-co. was formed in Sydney to test a
number of reefs at Cedar Creek, a few
miles from the old Eionsville field (N.S.W.).
Development proceeded quietly under W. G.
A. Smith, formerly of Gt. Cobar, and con-
sulting-engineer W. S. Curteis, and by
November several reefs had “proved of
sufficient dimension and rich enough” to
warrant the erection of a treatment plant.
So a no-liability co. took over and also
acquired a couple of adjoining leases. Plant
is now going up and some of the sweet stuff
in sight should be converted into cash next
month. Four reefs have been opened up,
and ore already developed is expected to
return £2OOO over the plates. That value
is based on the assumption that the tonnage
averages 30z.. though one reef of about a
foot is carrying 6oz. The management be-
lieves it has hit on a “real gold mine,” but
very much more development is necessary to
establish the future of the show: so far only
a small section of the reefs has been opened
up. Meanwhile sufficient has been seen to
encourage hopes of a recurrence of bonan-
zas that made the near-by Garibaldi and
Lion mines glitter years ago.
* * * *
A fortnight back the “Wild Cat” men-
tioned that the slate cos. operating near
Mudgee (N.S.W.) had so far had no out-
put. Since then the Mudgee Slate Co. has
marketed its hrsc lot of roonng material and
lU,uOO dampcourses. But whether these
opeiations nave been prohtable is another
maiter. Wastage is temhc, and the extent
of the deposits is not yet sufficiently proved
to indmate whether production can be con-
ducted on a gommerciaily-sound basis. The
N.S.W. Brospecung Board is assisting this
co. to probe the deposits on its leases.
Chairman Leggo had the unique experi-
ence tne oiner day of presiding over meetings
of Six mining cos. simultaneously— tne Ben-
digo Amalgamated “pups.” He justified the
poncy of having separate cos. on the argu-
ment that it “gives full range to those who
wish to continue prospecting work” in their
favored localit.es. He mentioned Hercules,
Monument and Carlisle as having the most
promising immediate prospects.

Directors of Morning Star, Wood’s Point
(Vic.), lacked d.piomacy in not intimating
at the recent meeang that a div. of Is. would
be payable at the end of the month, being
the second for the current year. Share-
holders seemed dissatisfied, in view of satis-
factory yields, that this div. had not been
declared. The chairman, however, made up
for the omission and moilihed them with a
roseate picture of prospects. The new 10-
head battery would oe working in Aprd, and
then, it is estimated, the output would be
2000 tons per month. On this output of 25dwt.
ore, “shareholders should receive 20s. per share
per year, as costs would be materially re-
duced as tonnage' was increased, whereas
1000 tons of 25dv\ t. ore, under present condi-
tions, wouid about pay its way. At the
present depth of the shaft there was five or
ten years’ work ahead.” The share-market,
however, refuses to reflect this optimism.
Bird’s Reef, Bendigo, has started its un-
watering campaign with a powerful Corn.sh
pump and tanks. There is a large body of
water in the long line of old workings, and
it is not anticipated that it will be possible
to inspect the lowest level for five or six
weeks yet. If close investigation half con-
firms the prospects indicated by a recent
compilation of records, the co. has good
Chances, provided adequate funds are
assured, a vigorous development policy is
pursued, and the fatal mistake is not made
of erecting elaborate plant before the mine
is ready for it.
A development is reported from North
Drummond, near Kyneton (Vic.), which
may revive interest in that once-important
centre. A party prospecting to the south of
the old Queen’s Birthday mine has located
what is said to be a continuation of the
Queen’s reef, which “shows gold freely.”
The Q.B. produced 60,0000 z., and paid
£40,000 of divs. without making a call.
“Stellsby”: “M.E.” (B. 8/2/’23) says
that the gold-workings nearest to Melbourne
were at Templestowe, not far from Heidel-
berg, where a gold-antimony lode exists. If
“M.E.” turns up the Illustrated Mel-
bourne Post of January 24, 1863, he will
find a report of the first meeting of the Col-
lingwood Gold Mining Co., held at Mac’s
Hotel, Smith-street, when Graham Berry re-
ported favorably on a “strike” at the rear of
the Royal George Hotel, Hoddle-street.

Some very good specimen stone is being
obtained from the Eclipse and Surprise, at
Brookfield, near Brisbane, down to 70ft. So
far it is only from leaders. There is nothing
bigger than Tin. or Bin., though prospects look
a bit more cheerful for eventually cutting a
good body. At least half-a-dozen carry good
gold and may make into something. The
other possibility is the occurrence of paral-
lel veins, and crosscutting would appear to
be a good line to follow in addition to sink-
ing.
Murphy’s Creek copper show, not far
below the Toowoomba Range (Q.), has been
taken up again. Prospects have been known
for 15 years to exist there and several shafts
and cuts put down during that period on
native copper and pyrites have revealed
bunches of good ore. The show has been
condemned several times, but the jump in
copper has set some of the old hands think-
ing, and a little more cash is to be raked
in to give it another chance. The ore carries
a trifle of gold to make things easier.
# * *
A gold-bearing lode has been unearthed
at Mt. Thora, Cloncurry, (Q.), which is
worth testing on account of its size—up to
sft. wide. The ore shows some free gold,
but other assays so far have been disappoint-
ing and have given only up to lOdwt. As a
prospect it looks worth following up for
an outside chance only. Cloncurry has never
brought a payable gold reef to light yet,
despite its richness in a big variety of other
minerals.
* * * *
Eungella tableland, behind Mackay (Q.),
is being prospected for gold by a number of
small parties. A few prospectors’ shows
have been unearthed, and the Mines Dept,
is assisting development. It is a contmua-
tion of the Normanby and Marengo gold-
field country. This granite and diorite
tableland is rough and inaccessible, but
colors have been found right through the
length and breadth of it, and it must be
given a slight chance yet to produce some-
thing big. * * *
The output of Bowen (Q.) coal is
steadily increasing, the maximum so far
being just over 350 tons per day. The State
mine has got up to 300 tons daily as a
regular performance, and the Consolidated is
mining, and at the same time devoloping.
The Consolidated plumped for the Garr.ck
seam, whereas the State tunnel is on the
Bowen. The Garrick won’t stand much
handling, and fires easily, but being a bit
lower in ash should produce a better coke if
works are ever established. The private enter-
prise mine can hit the Bowen with a straight
shaft between 200 ft. and 300 ft. down, and
there is about lift, of workable coal there.
A new pier for the coal trade is going up
at Port Denison, and by the time it is
ready it is estimated that the two mines
will be turning out 1000 tons daily.
* * . * *
On the Styx coalfield (Q.) the Mines
Department’s No. 21 bore has passed through
sft. Oin. of clean coal. This find adds a
few million tons to the estimate of coal
available in settled country. Hitherto the
trouble has been the highly folded and
faulted areas. Brophy is reported to have
collared an order for 1500 tons for the Navy,
and the output will be jumped up consider-
ably over 100 tons a day. The railways are
using a 50-50 mixture of Styx and Baralaba
coals: but the price, 265. 6d. in Rockhamp-
ton. is pretty stiff.
The revival at Ilerberton (N.Q.) is re-
flected in an effort to resuscitate the Tinaroo,
worked with pretty good results before the
other field had made any headway. A couple
of shows are being taken up and cleaned out,
and a lucky strike would put the old place
on the map again. Concentrates (70 p.c.)
are up to £lO2 10s. on the northern fields —
the best price for a long time.

“Peter”: As almost every oil-bore that
has so far pierced the continent has been
reported as having disclosed favorable indi-
cations, I move that from now on all “indi-
cation” reports be declared an offence. The
time has arrived when reports should be
restricted to footage and actual flow of oil.

“He told me I looked eighteen years older
than when he last saw me.”
“What confounded cheek!”
“Not at all. When he last saw me I teas
six months old.”
“Sierra” puts it concisely j
The miracle-working of such as Hickson is a
simple art, and one of the oldest in existence. It
has been practised by all races and religions since
the dawn of history. Some people think that Indian
jugglers, before performing their most wonderful
feats, first hypnotise their audience. This is not
necessary, as every crowd, once it becomes homo-
geneous, possesses the power of hypnotising itself.
The Indian’s sing-song and kazoo-playing overture
allows time for this to take place, and then the
crowd is prepared to see and believe anything sug-
gested by mass-imagination. The recital of past
triumphs in the miracle line, such as rain-making,
casting out evil spirits, healing the sick, smelling
out thieves, etc., tends to create sympathy between
the miracle-man and the crowd, and is the usual
preliminary amongst all races. Music of any kind
and sudden arresting silences help greatly in indue-
ing a state of emotional expectancy, utterly opposed
to reason, in homogeneous crowds. The priests’
leading of chanting sufferers to the miraculous
spring at Lourdes, the Hicksons’ laying on of
hands to slow music or amidst impressive silence,
and the Kaffir witch-doctor’s incantations, aided by
the noisy ritual of his side-kickers, are slight varia-
tions of the same trick of rendering the crowd
homogeneous and susceptible of self-hypnotism. At
this stage the miracle-monger gets to his work. All_
Christian sects combined to put the black witch-
doctor out of business; but from personal observa-
tion I am convinced that the black witch-doctor
supplies more real uplift to his clients than does
his white fellow-fakir.
“ Jacaranda”: Considered as a cook, the
Solomon Islander is quick to learn, adaptive
and always ready to improvise labor-saving
appliances. We once entertained, in our
South Sea home, a guest of some tonnage in
the Imperial scheme. He was dyspeptic, and
always insisted on his bread being toasted.
One night my duty as hostess took me out
to see what was delaying this special article
of diet. I found cookie sitting down trying
to brown the last piece of ash-covered bread
at a few dying embers, while the pieces that
were done were standing up between the toes
of his outstretched foot as jauntily as they
ever could in any silver rack. And on his
face was the pleased smile of an inventor.
“F.A.” reviews a troop of horse: —
The N.S.W. Lancers, some ex-members of which
have been having a re-union, was Australia's first
cavalry regiment. During the regime of Governor
Loftus, an ex-imperial cavalryman named Thompson
arrived in Sydney from Maoriland. He had served
in the Crimea and the Indian Mutiny. Subsequently
settling at Dunedin (M.L.), he had assisted to recruit
Maoriland’s first cavalry outfit, later known as the
Otago Hussars. In Sydney, shortly after his arrival,
Thompson obtained the Governor’s permission to
enrol a cavalry regiment. His method was simple;
he just meandered about with a notebook and pencil
and an- eye fob a good seat and a well-found
horse. When a possible recruit hove in sight, the
one-man recruiting staff would bail him up and get
his name and address. In a very short, time enough
names were obtained for a first parade on the Domain
near Government House. Colonel J. MacDpnald, a
retired Imperial Cavalry officer, who lived pq the
Lane Cove Road, was the first figure-head of the
corps, whose first public function was to escort the
Soudan contingent to its embarkation. The Lancers
faded out with the introduction of the training sys-
tem now in vogue, although a N.S.W. Light Horse
Regiment carries the title by courtesy. But. there
is nothing in the new formation to identify it with
the old excepting the spirit of its members. Even
the pigsticker is missing.

“Digger’s Batman”: One of the definite
duties of the regimental padre was the burial
of the dead. When a corpse, or even a
skeleton, was discovered, the chaplain was
notified, and would duly apply for a burial
party. One well-known padre of the Ist
Division was an enthusiast; and, at
Wyschaete, where the much fought-over
ground was full of mouldering remains,
sometimes merely peeping from shell-turned
soil, he kept the' burial parties busy. Near
Lamp-post Corner a skeleton was found aud
solemnly interred. The skull was smashed
badly, but one of the burial party, a natural-
ist by profession, protested that it was
more 'like a skull of an ape, and expressed
louder doubts about the bones being human.
However, the padre gave the unknown the
benefit of the doubt, and buried him as a
nameless Christian. Mentioning the inci-
dent at Dranoutre, where there were still
some French people, I learnt that a man
at Wyschaete had kept a small zoo, consist-
ing of some apes and a couple of bears.
Our ape was buried C. of E.; I have often
wondered what religion the other animals
were buried in.
“Wilfrido”: Whatever may be said against
die Chows, as far as M.L. is concerned there
is a good deal to go on. the credit side. They
are at least grateful for what is done for
them. One of them, who hailed from the
south of China, could not get a hearing from
the Consul, who came from the North, and
he went to see the Chief Justice about it.
The Chief Justice, with his native courtesy,
received him and put him on the right track.
On arriving home a few days later ’s Honor
found three sacks of vegetables at his back
gate and a jar of preserved ginger on his
window-sill.

About a man who failed to read the Signs
of the Times :
Der.’j Lyons got the surprise of his life in Sydney
last week when, for working a horse with a sore
back, he Brun Brown, S.M., passed him 21 days’
ha 1 labor “without the option.” Denis was in
the act of explaining that everybody did it, cr
words to that effect, when he was brusquely re-
moved. Withot in any way condoning his abomin-
able offence—one, incidentally, that this paper has
been drawing attention to for more years than it
cares to remember —it may be said that Lyons is,
in a sense, the victim of other men’s crimes, and
of other magistrates’ and Judges’ leniencies. A
score of cases of atrocious cruelty have come before
the N. S. Wales Courts of late years, and the
offenders have got off either lightly or altogether.
A storm that had been gathering for some time
burst when at last Quarter-Sessions Judge Arm-
strong sentenced Carl Oscar Mikkalson (these
Sadistic brutes usually have foreign names) to a
month for beating a horse to death, and then
released him under the First Offenders’ Act. Lead-
ing articles were published by dailies which had
made no comment whatever on the even more hor-
rible Bowi a\ case last year; scandalised letters
poured in, and, what is more, were printed. There

ourselves just, the same.”
was every sign that the sluggish public conscience
had been well and truly kicked into wakefulness.
But men of the Lyons type are not sociological
students, and so it comes about that Denis is in
Long Bay Gaol, paying vicariously for Mikkalson’s
crime.

“Six-and-eight”: Decided at Glenelg
(S.A.) that it is “insulting words” to shout
“Beaver!” pointedly at a bearded man. It
cost the humorist ss. and 15s. costs. By
the way, it is said that the word has acquired
quite the wrong sound. Bevan, the abscond-
ing company promoter, wore an egregiously
false beard.' A photo of it reached Oxford,
where every common word is corrupted with
the “er” ending. Thus, as breakfast becomes
“brekker” and Rugby football “Rugger,” the
Bevan beard became a “bevver.” The public,
getting hold of the word, naturally gave it
the “beaver” sound, and has always asso-
ciated it with the animal of that name.
“Helen Holt”: I don’t know whether a
late Judge was ever known as a poet
among his confreres of the N.S.W. Supreme
Court Bench, but a verse of his comes to
mind. Written behind the door of a white-
washed, ivy-covered building in a corner of
the old garden, it ran: —
TO PERCY AND THE OTHER CHILDREN.
Ambition, well directed, is a brave and good desire ;
It lifts our hearts, it makes our thoughts to noble
things aspire;
But if within the world’s great page you wish for
lasting fame, .
Choose a fairer spot than this, my child, on which to
write your name.
There were many signatures on the walls,
including several of cousins of the Percy re-
ferred to, and to-day I can count 15 of that
clan who served in the Great War. One
acouired wealth, but preferred a trooper s
saddle and a soldier’s grave to a life of moneyed
ease; others collected wound-stripes _ and
decorations. These indeed have established
a chain to “lasting fame,” so who shall say
the verse fired no ambition?
“Sucre”: Lismore (N.S.W.) is the crema-
torium of Australia. Here 23 Hindoos have
gone up in smoke from the funeral pyre.
The latest was one Dava Singh, whose clay
tenement, arrayed in expensive silk pyjamas
and socks, was reduced to ashes in the pres-
ence of hundreds of curious white folk. A
pound of butter was dabbed over the corpse s
head, a gallon of kerosene poured over the
silks and a match finished the job. A handy
club in the hands of the M.C. reduced the
skull of Dara to powder in the course of
the ceremony. Finally the residue was
bottled, and the Ganges will carry the spirit
of the Hindoo on its oily bosom to some
Oriental heaven.

“Kip” surveys the Jap ethnologically;—
It was the anthropologist who came to the rescue
of the U.S. Supreme Court in the recent claim
by the Japanese for
American naturalisa-
tion rights on the
gound that they came
in the category of
“white persons.” The
anthropologist divides
mankind into three
d i s t n c t races,
Caucasian (white),
Mongoloid (yellow),
and Negroid (black),
each with pronounced
and indelible charac-
teristics. The Jap. con-
tended that as he was
not black he was
white; but, apart
from the actual differ-
ence in skin pigmen-
tation, he possessed
three distinct charac-
teristics which associ-
ate him with the Mon-
goloid race. His hair
is always black, and
comes out of the skin
perfectly straight,
whereas the white
man’s comes out at' an
angle; a transverse cut
of his head shows it
to be perfectly circu-
lar, while in the case
of the Caucasian race
it is oval; his incisors
are shovel-shaped as
opposed to the straight
cutting edge of the
white man’s front
teeth. The “almond
eye” is, of course, his
other distinguishing
trait; but actually his
eye does not slant, and
structurally is identi-
cal with that of the
other races. It is the
curious formation o?
his upper eyelid which
gives the Jap’s eye
this slanting appear-
ance ; instead of reach-
ing almost over to the
nose, as. is the ease with both the Caucasian and
Negroid races, it folds down slightly on to the
lower eyelid.
“Veal” : Now that the Church of England
heads talk of revising the Prayer Book
I’d suggest that a price-list or scale of
charges be inserted in it to let the mere
bloke know what he’s expected to pay when
he gets married, or has the infant’s head
sprinkled, or requires some other ecclesiasti-
cal job done. The “fee” for the marriage
ceremony certainly needs attention. Not
long ago I was misguided enough to con-
template matrimony and decided that the
curate, a friend, should officiate. Out of
courtesy I mentioned it to his boss and
learned that if I employed the curate
I’d have to part up two “fees”—the _ addi-
tional one to the boss, for letting the junior

do the work, I presume—and that “the
usual fee is three guineas, you know.” A
little later I best-manned at a union of souls
and, before the show started, handed over
the “fee” in an envelope. So portentously
solemn was the holy man’s inquiry whether
the envelope contained three guineas that
I’m certain if I’d kept back a bob for beer
he’d have left some slack in the knot.

JANE’S JOB.
[FOR THE BULLETIN. ]
“At Arncliffe and Kogarah you have to pay a
woman 13s. a day, and if you enter the room
quietly you will find her reading a yellowback.”—
Remark ' made by a lady at a meeting called in
Sydney to discuss the domestic-servant problem.
Our Jane sits by the kitchen sink,
Her yellowback before her,
The heroine is quite all right
And all the men adore her.
So Janie reads, and quite unheeds
The cat that on the bacon feeds.
For Janie’s eyes devour with joy
Each detail of the thrilling scene,
In which the hero scales the wall
And carries off his Geraldine.
Meanwhile, the eat has left the fat
And drags the fish across the mat.
The tripe is burning on the stove,
But Janie never smells it,
For now the hero’s making love,
And, gosh! how well he tells it.
The dog sneaks in and steals a shin
Of beef from out the baking-tin.
Jane’s tearful eyes are on her book —
Fair Geraldine’s in trouble;
The villain, with his cigarette,
Has burst her love-dream bubble
While Janie's job, at thirteen bob,
Is burning saucepans on the hob.
The lovers now are on their knees
Before the rich and haughty Earl,
Who ere he throws a fit exclaims,
“My daughter weds no base-born churl I”
And Jane shrieks “Oh!” as on tiptoe
Her missus comes and murmurs “Go!”

“X2X”: In an Australian hospital re-
cently a stillborn child was observed to have
a small swelling on the left side of the neck.
Upon this being opened it was discovered to
be almost a perfect example of the rare
dermoid cyst. Amongst the contents- were
a rudimentary eye and three minute but
properly-formed teeth, in addition to some
scraps of ordinary tissue, the cyst being
about 2in. by 2in. A dermoid cyst reported
in Germany some years before the war con-
tained a small reproduction of one of the
ductless glands and an eye, the latter being
an anatomical marvel.
“Henry Bateson” : Wellington (M.L.) has
just had a third-degree case, in which the
prisoner alleged that the confession was
forced out of him by a little judicious starva-
tion. The jury said not guilty, and the daily-
press has been airing the general idea that
all confessions must be given voluntarily. As
a matter of fact, the M.L. law does not lay
this down. According to our statutes dealirg
with evidence, the confession may be given
voluntarily or otherwise, but if the magis-
trate believes that the methods used by the
police were such as to have caused the pri-
soner to make a false confession he may rule
the accused’s statement out. The dailies
have also been insisting that a pol.ee official
must warn a man when arresting him that
anything he may say can be used in evidence
against him. But here they crash again.
The M.L. law does not make this cautioning
necessary.

“The Deacon”: Though the Vincentian
Bishop O’Farrell, of Bathurst, has con-
demned the Hickson healing mission with-
out qualification, a former archbishop, Pold-
ing, practised the laying on of hands, with-
out, however, attaching to it any miraculous
significance. About the only one of the
latter-day clergy to do such a thing was a
cleric who had been associated with Bold-
ing. That was the late Rev. James Sheri-
dan, who later in life took up the role of
dance-reformer to the miners of Lithgow—
with disastrous results. Around the Nepean
district (N.S.W.) and the South Coast there
are still to be found many who contend that
the old gentleman saved their lives. Still,
as the spiritual cure was invariably associa-
ted with stiff doses of castor oil at frequent
intervals, he didn’t achieve much popularity
as a healer.
“Wings”: The invention of another heli-
copter (Brennan, the Australian, produced the
first) gives promise that aviation will soon
cease to be an affair of jolts, bumps and
crashes. The earmarks of a helicopter are
that it is able to rise perpendicularly and
alight the same way, so it requires no
large, smooth, prepared space to .prance
about in, and can rough it among mountains
and other wild places. In addition it is able
to remain poised in the air when its engine

over the nearest embankment in the same
conditions. An air vessel with the latest
improvements should really be safer than any
land or sea craft, for it can dodge over
and under as well as to right and left.
Further, it is exempt from attack by
bulls, dogs, whales and other wild fauna;
it is out of the way of bush-fires; trees don’t
fall on it, and it doesn’t run into derel’cts

“Sir Spen” : A couple of highly-placed N.
S. Walies civil servants are suffering from
strained relations through a misplaced note
of interrogation in a telegram. One, a
Crown Land agent, wired to the head Lands
office of his district for advice as to whether
a selector might take a certain step without
obtaining the Minister’s consent as a pre-
liminary. The officer in charge wired back:
“Why not? Read Section 272.” But the
postal department’s ruthless rendering ran :
“Why not read Section 272?”
"F.Z.” finds the Cockney gasping : —-
Talk horrifying to your true Londoner is that
current about the setting-up of a licensed caravan-
serai in historic Adelphi Terrace. It will not be
yet awhile—-several leases have to expire—but it's
a million-pound site, though with narrow approaches,
and the owners are soulless enough to want the
money. The scheme
(British and Ameri-
can) is for a thous-
and-bedroom edifice,
with etceteras that
will offer “the best
and brightest of hotel
life” to visitors —
specially American.
For years the quarter
has been the domain
of art and literature,
and leading authors
attain to a flat in
Adelphi as to Nir-
vana. Its historic art
associations go back to
Adam—not the gar-
dener, but the famous
brothers Adam who
built furniture in the
street bearing their
name. (By the way,
Sir Charles Adam, a
descendant of the fur-
niture-markers, died
the other day. His title
died with him, but his
property goes to .a son
of the late Keith
Adam, who married
one of the witty Leake
sisters who lived in
Katanning, W.A., years
ago.) The Little Theatre
is there, and Unwin's
publishing house, and
no end of picture-,
book-, bronze- and art-
shops—all small and
of traditional unpre-
tentiousness. And the
end is now in sight.
Times are changing.
Take Devonshire House
in Piccadilly, now
open to the public.
How the bones of
those of the old regime
would castanet round
the graveyards if they
could see its grey, old
walls strung with
fluttering calico signs
announcing beanfeasts
in aid of hospitals
and a pot-bellied “God of Joy’’ perched over the
portico through which the flower of England’s aris-
tocracy has passed, and which anyone may enter
how for “Is. 3d. including tax!”
“Chris”: Apropos Mr. Hickson’s faith-
healing campaign, among other things. A
Maoriland resident had an aloe-tree which
flowered in its rare splendor. Full of the
gloomy belief that the sight presaged ap-
proaching death, two lady friends of the
owner, who was lying ill at the time, bore
down upon him with sad faces and gloomy
predictions. Taking their words to heart,
the sick man rose with the sun next morn-
ing, wrapped up warmly, and, taking his
axe into the garden, felled th& offending" vege-
table. Then he went back into the house
and proceeded to get well at once, persuading
himself that he had got rid of the death
laden omen.

“Randolph Rentless”: The irony of Fate!
Something over a quarter of a century ago
a peculiarly atrocious person named Butler
was in the habit of advertising for partners
with cash for prospecting tours. His victims
were induced to dig a hole big enough for
a grave, under the delusion that they were
after gold. Subsequently a battered corpse
would go into the cavity and Butler would
go off with his plunder. One of the places
where this crime was staged was Cudal
(N.S.W.), and here gold has now been
discovered. Local tradition places Butler’s
camp within 10 feet of a shaft now being
sunk to locate what is supposed to be a
rich vein.
“P.X.”: Isn’t Australia, after all, the
only English-speaking country in the world?
Canada has its big French population, and
S. Africa its Dutch; in New York alone
there are over two millions who curse
U.S.A.’s Dry law in none but foreign
tongues; and most of India knows only
about three words of English when it knows
any at all. The British Isles, too, are out
of the running. I hadn’t thought of them
as quite like that until one morning before
breakfast I went for a stroll through Dol-
gelle.v, which is in the neighborhood of
Lloyd George’s stronghold of Aberystwyth, in
Wales. Fourteen people I heard talk dur-
ing that early stroll, and only one sentence
was in English—flung by one man at another
as they parted. The rest of the greetings, the
conversations, the good-byes were in the
sonc-language of the country. The oldest
inhabitant, who had been as far afield as
Swansea, and had picked up some English
on the way, took me to the local “school of
arts”: the s.gn upon it was in Cymric.
Lloyd George when he goes into those parts
would be unintelligible to most of the inhabi-
tants if he spoke to them in English ; as a
matter of fact, some of his most important
speeches have had to be translated into Eng-
lish for the consumption of admirers at
Hoxton and Battersea. It was a little
smaller surprise when, at Ballachulish, in the
Highlands, the lady in attendance darted off
to bring her husband. “She doesn’t speak
English,” he explained—“and I didn’t either
till the war.” Later, on the ferry that
carries your car the 300 yards or so across
Loch Leven for 10s., passengers extra, I
heard not a word of English; and Loch
Leven isn’t so far north or west either. So
we’ll brand Australia the only purely Eng-
lish-speaking part of the Empire and put
another feather in our tail to go on with.

“Dr. Nil” on anaesthetics that talk, etc: —
“Azrim” (B. 8/2/’23) says, “My own professional
experience is that talking during anesthesia is rare.”
I, C. H. Sherlock Nil, have experienced otherwise.
Having been taught the sawbones trade in Aberdeen,
lam naturally an ether man. (Edinburgh favors
chloroform.) In the Aberdeen Hospital theatre,
operating-time was reminiscent of feeding-time at
at Zoo. I never knew such noisy results as occurred
with “Glover’s inhaler,” which I first saw used in
1882. In my own practice I have seen some curious
unconscious or subconscious effects under ether
anaesthesia. A station cook once came in for operation.
He described himself as a bachelor, but while returning
to consciousness he commenced to mumble and finally
ordered “Sarah! Sarah!” to “Get up—there’s some-
one on the verandah!” When giving ether for
extraction of teeth I once allowed a patient, a
hefty market-gardener, to come “half-to.” The
united efforts of myself and the operator failed to
keep him in the chair. Nothing had been done to
his jaws, but he barged round the room, overturning
the furniture and shouting “I’ve been 20 blanky
minutes in Hell!” When we had finished and he
woke up he remembered nothing about it. The
politest patient I ever had was just nearly “under”
ether when she gently but firmly took off the mask
and handed it up to me, remarking sweetly: “You
can have it. I don’t want it.” I once gave “gas”
to a champion footballer, one of the gentlest men I
ever knew. Just before he came round he suddenly
rose and passed the dentist one in the jaw that
crumpled up the recipient in a heap in the corner
of the surgery. He nearly wept when enlightened
about the punch. Speaking from personal experience,
having had ether on four occasions and chloroform
twice, I may say that the only time I am recorded
to have spoken at all was when I lost consciousness
whilst admonishing the surgeon for giving a prac-
tical demonstration to the onlookers, with the butt-
end of his knife, of what he was going to do to my

Passed out at 87 “Wullie” Affleck, for
many years a member of the N.S.W. Leg.
Assembly. He arrived in N.S.W. by the
immigrant ship Nabob, in 1855, and went to
Gundaroo, where he lived for 44 years—
first as a farm laborer, afterwards as a
cocky, with one horse and a single-furrow
plough to begin with. In 1894 he got a
more remunerative job as member for Yass
Plains. That and storekeeping at Gun-
daroo kept his pot boiling. No cocky in his
electorate appealed to him in vain when
threatened by the Lands Dept, with forfeit-
ure for arrears of rent and instalments.
“Wullie” weathered five or six elections, but
met his political Waterloo in 1904.

js seen from the Gallery:—
(?f the new men in the House of Reps. Latham
seems the most impressive. He is not a striking-
speaker, but his discourses are full of meat, and his
Man-of-Destiny countenance carries a lot of weight.
Near him in the Corner sits Victor Charles Thomp-
son,- member for New England (N.S.W.), whose
pince-nez and trim, creased clothes afford a violent
contrast to the undistinguished raiment of the
towering Killen, who shuffled into Chanter’s seat,
lvillen is probably the tallest man who has ever
been elected to the Reps. A more rugged specimen
of agriculturist is the white-haired and white-
moustached John McNeill whom Arthur Rodgers's
ungrateful constituents elected for Wannon (Vic.).
The flowers of culture do not bloom in McNeills
orations. He only grows eloquent on seed-drills,
onions and manures. His new Labor colleagues
are not astonishing on a first inspection. Percy
Edmund Ccleman, the eye-glassed and confident
young tribune from Reid (N.S.W.), shows the same
immaturity as the good-looking and serious son of
old Ted Riley. Edward Charles Riley, who outed
Catts, may have some of his dad’s urbanity, but
he is concealing his inheritance from the public
for the present. F. A. McDonald, Lamond’s suc-
cessor, is a round-faced Labor idealist who finished
his maiden speech with a fervent recitation from
Brunton Stephens. His premature baldness looms
up through a halo of sandy hair. Lacey, who is
responsible for the absence of Poynton, is a small
brunette. On the Nationalist side Neville Howsc
has enough dignity and appearance for two of his
kind. Edward Mann, who beat Fowler in Perth,
exhibits traces of brains, and something may be
heard of him if he doesn’t go mad about Foreign-
trade. Then there is William Watson, the antithesis
of his poetic namesake in every possible way. He
and his adhesive secretary remind one quaintly of
Don Quixote and Sancho Panza.

“Rienzi”: Victoria’s late Agent-General,
Peter Mcßride, who has died at Cannes,
was a whale for cigars, and it was not
remarkable that David Low caught him with
a bloated torpedo in his countenance when
the artist called for a caricature. Mcßride
had a large, fleshy nose and full red lips,
but Low was not so much touched by these
aspects as by the huge bundle of tobacco
that the statesman was burning. The result
was a drawing of an enormous Cauliflora de
I-labana with Mcßride’s features trying to
crowd in behind it. It was farcical, erroneous,
but somehow it was Mcßride. The only
comment I could make was that the cigar
seemed to ruin the picture. “Not a bit of
it,” said Low; “cut out that unholy weapon
and you rob Mcßride of his personality.”
Professor Mitchell, of Adelaide, has been
paid the big compliment of an invitation to
give the Gifford lectures at Aberdeen next
year. Old Adam Gifford, who established
them about 20 years back, laid down that
they were to be on “natural theology in the
widest sense of that term. The lecturers
appointed may be of any religion or no reli-
gion, or may be so-called sceptics or agnos-
tics or freethinkers; provided only that the
Board use diligence to secure able, reverent
men, sincere lovers of and earnest inquirers
after truth.” The endowment covers also
the Universities of Edinburgh, Glasgow and
St. Andrew’s, and has attracted lately such
big men as Bergson (France), William
James (U.S.A.), and Balfour. About 10
lectures are stipulated, extending over two
years; but Mitchell’s time is now his own,
as he lately resigned the Chair of Philosophy
at Adelaide, though retaining the Vice-Chan-
cellorship of the University.
While giving evidence before the N.S.W.
Parliamentary Committee on Public Works
at West Wyalong in connection with a pro-
posal to build a railway from Wyalong to-
wards Condobolin, Samuel Ridley was asked
if he was a son of R ; dley, the inventor of
the stripper. He said he was. Asked if he
followed in his father’s footsteps in trying
to improve the machinery connected with
agriculture, he replied with an emphatic
“No,” and added : “It means too much lost
sleep.” Further questions elicited that
Samuel when quite young had to strike for
his dad in the smith shop at all hours of
the night, while the older Ridley was work-
ing out some of his mechanical devices —
this, too, after a heavy day’s work. As a
result of these early experiences young Sam
developed a bias against inventions and in-
ventors, which apparently he still maintains
at well on towards 70. The original Ridley
produced his reaper in S. Australia ; passing
to N. S. Wales he settled m the VVyalong
district, and was responsible for numerous
inventions, one of which, the poison-cart, for
destroying rabbits, gave him a steady income
of £lO a week. He died some years ago at
83, leaving five sons resident in the district.
“Huffin-Guflin” : About the most interest-
ing exhibit at the Back-to-Hamilton (Vic.)
celebrations was Tom Oa'wker driving a
four-in-hand team from the box-seat of an
old Coob and Go. coach. Among the fares
was a lady who had been his passenger from
Penola (S.A.) to Hamilton 60 years ago.
Tom cculd hardly have looked better pleased
had the present King, another fare in the
long ago, stepped up to the coach. Cawker
drove George and the Duke of Clarence
from Oasterton to Hamilton in 1880. He
still lives at Casterton.
“Tirnson”: The Reps, having gone into
recess, Speaker Watt will have three months
to decide whether he will be robed like his
predecessor. Probably all his incLnations
would be against the dreadful un form,
while his fondness for hygiene ought to
damn the insanitary wig. One of his first
acts as Speaker was to open the windows of
his official room, to the great horror of the
previous Speaker’s batman, who, like his
master, grew thin through constant terror
of draughts. Watt even abolished a cher-
ished bit of trellis-work that blocked the
light, and now works in anything from a
breeze to a full-blown gale. What other
measuies of reform he contemplates are not
known, but if he started off by giving the
lower paid men a lift in screw, he would
be dealing effectively with an old scandal.
A man who was old enough to have been
in business hard by Sydney’s Circular Quay
in the forties of last century died last
week. John Stoneman Lane used to play
cricket as a boy where the Royal Exchange
now stands. He lived in Reiby-lane, off
Pitt-street, and was little more than a lad
when he embarked in business as a ship’s
chandler on the banks of “the Pitt-street
Canal.”
H. Allerdale Grainger should be included
in the list of surviving ex-S. Aus. Agents-
General (B. l/3/’23). He'represented the
State in London in 1901-05, and came back
to Adelaide, but returned some time ago to
England. On this subject ex-Senator Symon
writes:—
The Bulletin omitted Allerdale Grainger, the
most able, well-informed and original-minded of
them all. He is living in England with his sister
at Leamington Spa. He came up to London to see
me when I was there 18 months ago, and we spent
a most pleasant afternoon at the Savage Club, of
which he is a member ; and it is only a few weeks
since I had a most interesting letter from him
on British politics and the European situation.
John Clark Ross, dead in Adelaide at
close on 60, had a busy and useful life.
Coming to Australia with an engineering
training in Scotland, he helped to build
various Vic. railways about Warrnambool
and from Hamilton to Coleraine (Vc.).
Then he was in charge of water supply at
Warrnambool, Toowoomba apd Hobart, only
leaving the Speck when he became Ch'ef
Engineer of the Hume Pipe Co. in S’Africa.
Since 1920 he had been with the eo. in West-
ralia, and latterly in South Aus.
“D.G.”: When the faultlessly-tailored
Norman Bayles was member for Toorak in
Vic. Assembly his cultured accents and
general aesthetics provided fair game for
Labor followers. At one of his election
meeting Bayles, with studied diction, charged
the Labor Opposition with being devoid of
courage. “If I may say it,” quoth he, “this
weakness amounts to a lack of conlidence
in itself; a dire want, if I may be permitt d
to say so, of —of—-of—” “Guts !’* came from
the back of the hall.
A few days back at Redfern (Sydney) Mrs.
Mary Elizabeth Crawford, an ex-Maori-
lander, was granted an auctioneer's license.
It isn’t her first successful application,
either; she has used the hammer previously
at Cootamundra. The South Coast has a
going, going, gone lady; and Miss Emma
Pyers, eldest daughter of the late Robert
Pyers, one-time M.L.A. for the Richmond,
successfully carries on her father’s old busi-
ness. Miss Pyers seems to have been the
first woman in N. S. Wales to apply for and
be granted an auctioneer’s license.
“The Deacon”: Whether it is the climate
or the whiskers the R.O. prelates of Maori-
land live long. A class’c example to com-
pete with Monsignor Mackay of Dunedin
CB. l/3/’23) is the hirsute Archbishop Red-
wood, head of all Maoriland prelates and
priests, who at 80-odd, though he doesn’t
drive his own car like the other ancient, will
entertain his friends by the hour playing
classical (and other) tunes on his priceless
Strad. Incidentally, Sydney also has its
venerable upholder of the threepenny piece.
Archpriest Collins has pounded the' classic
suburban pulpit of Mount Carmel for just on
40 years, has seen the passing of innumer-
able "heads” and looks like seeing out a heap
more. An unassuming man, he is absolutely
unknown beyond the sandhills, but he ranks
as one of the R.C.s’ most scholarly readers
and deepest thinkers. He is a brother of
the late Neal Collins, of the firm of Collins
and Mulholland, w'ho vigorously pursued
Costs for nearly half-a-century.
“Ivy Street” : Mat Reid, the sole survivor
of the Hughesite Labor Senators who Deed
the electors in December, hangs out at Too-
wong, Brisbane, when the House isn’t sitting.
He is addicted to prowling barefooted about
his vegetable garden, and yarning over the
back fence with neighbors. Other hobbies
are the gramophone
and theosophy. Reid
is head-serang of
the Queensland
theosophists, and
when Mrs. Besant
last came to the
Commonwealth he
travelled over to
Fremantle to meet
the boat. But he
hasn’t converted
his cat to the vege-
tarian side of the
cult. That sordid
animal turns up
its nose at pulver-
ised b'rdseed and
crystallised nu t-
meg, and takes its
meals out.
A. W. PIPER ,
K.C., of Adelaide.
Alick Ogden, who has passed out at 59,
was an old-time Redfern builder who, re-
moving to Manly in the mid-’nineties, became
the foremost agitator against the old Port
Jackson Co.’s high fares. Out of that agi-
tation sprang the Manly Co-operative Ferry
Co., which, after a hard fight with the Port
Jackson people, amalgamated under an
arrangement which gave Manly the cheap
fares that did so much to put the Village on
the map in big letters. Ogden got into the
picture-show business later on and pros-
pered. He was a plucky little business
man who loved a fight—and .he generally
won.
George Brown, Vic. Government shorthand
writer, read back his Pitman shorthand
notes at the Bertha Goughian inquest at the
rate of 288 words a minute for 30 minutes,
and his feat gained the admiration of all in
court. Professor Scott had a much more
trying ordeal when he was on the State
Hansard, prior to Federation. There was
a wrangle in the State Assembly over what
somebody brought to the bar of the House
to answer a complaint had said, and Speaker
Mason called on Scott, on the spur of the
moment, to read what he had on his notes,
including the questions, chorus of interjec-
tions and the rest. Scott rose, took a pull
at himself, and rattled the stuff off as if it
were on a poster in half-inch letters. His
effort and his accuracy won cheers.
“Dick” Davis, dead in Melbourne, had
lived for some years in Vic., but was a S.
Australian in the days of the high b'cycle.
Old-timers recall with a thrill his duels with
Busst of Melbourne on the old flat track of
the Adelaide Oval, with its long straight for
the finish. In 1888 he won the Austral
Wheel Race in Melbourne, starting from
scratch and breaking the previous Australian
record.
Owen Smyth, formerly Superintendent of
Public Buildings in S. Aus., and Michael
Donegan, formerly of the police force in Ade-
laide, being of Irish blood, planned on re-
tirement to spend the rest of their days in
the Ould Country; but in each case a short
trial has been enough, and they are coming
back to S.A, to live. “A proper hell of a
country is Ireland to-day,” says one of
them. The other puts it rather more strongly.
Old Jimmy West, M.L.A., is probably
breathing a bit more freely. A month ago
Greg McGirr announced that he was going
to open a chemist’s shop in the heart of
the East Sydney electorate; and he became
busy around the premises—still in course of
alteration —getting friendly with the local
proletariat. Now the old announcement has
been superseded, and somebody else’s name
has gone up over the pill-box. It may be
that McGirr has abandoned any intention he
ever may have had of wooing this “Red”
stronghold ; but you never can tell.
Heckled in the House of Reps, when mak-
ing his maiden speech, Joshua Thomas Hos-
kins Whitsitt, M.H.R. for Darwin (T.),
mildly protested when the Speaker inter-
vonnr) on his behalf. “I am accustomed to
interjections,” he explained. Joshua got
accustomed to them when, as an Independ-
ent with the odd vote, he put a State Labor
Government in power. Two weeks later
he put it out again. For that he was called
25 synonyms for “twister,” but he took them
all with undisturbed sangfroid. He doesn’t
mind abuse a bit. The farmers on the
north-west coast sw y ear by him. He w r as
born in his constituency and raises spuds
in it. Also sheep.
SHIPS THAT PASS.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
The witness, a tall, rather distinguished-looking
man, gave his evidence with an Oxford accent. He
wore clothes of exceptional cut, though not too
new, and described himself as a greaser on the s.s.
Wanganui. —Sydney Sun.
I met him in a quayside street
One evening I was out;
’Twas then I heard the Oxford bleat
I’ve read so much about.
By Isis’ banks, in quad or hall,
I rather think it’s rare —
At any rate, 1 can’t recall
’Twas noticeable there.
But here it grips you when ’tis spoke
As surely as a coo-ec
The Digger thrilled in London smoke....
He said he was a greaser-bloke
Aboard the Wanganui.
A mild distinction marked his pose ;
The tavern doors were shut;
Though ’most as old as mine, his clothes
Betrayed the Bond-street cut.
But ’twas his utterance, 1 opine,
And not his rig or phiz
Proclaimed his Alma Mater mine,
And mine as surely his.
“Have you a match ?” It stopped me dead ;
Instinctively I knew he,
Like I, from proctors once had fled
He was a greaser, so he said,
On s.s. Wanganui.
I said 1 had. Beyond a doubt,
The old familiar tone
In answer brought the accent out
I never knew my own.
Inflection; —drawl —whate’er it is
It must exist. For sign
You see the way I dropped to his
And he was down on mine.
Undiagnosed at Home mayhap,
’Bove spats or under bluey
’Tis pikestaff-plain this side the map....
He said he was a greaser-chap
From off the Wanganui.

“Billy Cann”: In his brushes with Pommy
the cocky does not always score the grin. Two
new arrivals, perched high on a load of gear, pulled
up at Wiltshire’s pub at Sale (Vic.). A ladder was
lowered and one descended, sank a beer, then climbed
the ladder with a pot for his mate. The procedure
interested a cocky, who asked, “What yer want the
ladder for, Matey?” “We wants summat to help
we get up in the mawnins when we’s working for
you cookies,” was the prompt reply.
“Billy T.”: The worst place in creation
for blowflies used to be the Haunted Range, near
where Yallourn (Vic.) now stands. I speak of
many years ago when a prospecting expedition took
me into the district. The blowflies were as large
as cockchafers, and would attack anything, living
or dead. Tying meat in sacks or covering it
with wirework contrivances was equally vain. I
believe those flies could have blown a steak through
an iron tank. Then Hyde solved the mystery. He
came in one day with a buzzer he had (aptured,
which held between its forelegs a small tube
of curled bark. “So help me cat!” said Hyde, “No
wonder they can blow meat at ten paces. Look
here —the beggars use blowpipes!”
“F.A.” : Tell “Ack F. C.” that the three-
match superstition is but the outcome of a com-
mercial age. With the advent of the late war, and the
subsequent introduction of cigarette-lighters, the big
match-manufacturers saw a sudden downward curve
in the graph of demand, and with Wallingford
genius introduced the three-match joke to pull up
the slack. I took the third light from the farrier-
sergeant’s match just 20 yards from the big dump
at Hazebruck one afternoon just as “Electric Bill,”
the Hun railway gun, dropped a dud 6-inch into
the middle of the dump in the only bare patch of
ground within 50 feet.
* * * *
“Lantana” : “Jobber’s” time-keeping plant
(B. l/2/’23) is Sida rhombifolia— -otherwise Sida
retusa, Paddy’s lucerne, or Queensland hemp. It
is well and truly cursed not only in Bananaland
but also in N. S. Wales, from the Tweed River to
Lane Cove (Sydney), and is described under the
Local Government Act as a noxious plant. It is one
of the most heart-breaking growths the farmer and
grazier has to put up with. In my own home town
of Casino (N.S.W.), for instance, a fine 10-acre
grazing block of land, owned by the late Samuel
Joseph, was absolutely ruined and overrun by this
purple horror. The old police horse-paddock was
also a fertile breeding-ground for it, where there
was always a cateh-as-eatch-can tussle between it and
the fox-tail grass.
* * * #
“Ned Kelly” : It isn't only horses that get
a warning of danger long before humans (B.
8/2/’23). We once had an old dead tree in
the paddock about 50yds. from our door, and
this was the nightly roost for countless spar-
rows and starlings. One sundown w T e noticed that
the birds, instead of settling down quietly, were flut-
tering about and excitedly twittering. In a few
minutes they left the old home in a flock. Towards
midnight the tree came down with a terrific crash.
It was an unusually still night, and to us there had
been no signs to indicate the impending fall. What
warned the birds ?
“Nep Tune”: Re “Widgee’s” par (B.
8/2/’23) anent horses having a sense of danger un-
known to human beings. I think his horse merely
heard the limb snap, and instinctively sensed danger.
A few weeks ago, during a calm, hot spell, I had
my cows yafded up at midday, under a large gum-
tree. Standing near, I was startled bv tjie sudden
snap of a blanch overhead. The way thoke sleepy-
looking cows jumped off the mark was a revelation.
Three of them plunged directly through the fence,
and the remainder crowded through the gateway. By
the time the branch had reached the ground they
were all well out of range. I have handled cows for
many years, but for speed on their part I’ve seen
nothing to compare with this.
“Blunder Buss”: Tell “Bullet” (B.
8/2/’23) that increasing the charge of a cartridge
won’t help him to shoot straight. Also, it makes
no difference in accuracy if the nose of a bullet
is sharp or flat, but the flat nose does greater
damage, especially if, as “Ack P. G,” says, you
split the end with your penknife. If “Bullet” wants
to kill anything bigger than a wagtail let him get
a real rifle, not a pea-rifle. The only way to kill
with one of those things is to, first of all, fix it
firmly in a vice, and find out if it shoots straight;
if it doesn’t, try to make it do so by re-arranging
the sights. Should the thing shoot all over the
place, throw it away-—it takes an expert like me to
fix it up. Once you get confidence in your
weapon it won’t be long before you’ll start to
kill things. Two points about shooting with the
little rifle are: (1) Never shoot at anything over
60yds. ; and (2) aim at a vital spot—-if shooting
wallaby, try for the butt of the ear or the neck,
and not merely the biggest part of the animal. All
big firms keep a staff qf experts experimenting so
as to get the very best results in the hope of
beating the other fellow. The man who can show
them any points is wasting his time in the bush.
The experienced shooter knows quite a lot of little
things about a rifle, such as substituting a knife-
spring for a broken extractor and making a hair-
trigger and sights; but when it comes to muzzle
velocity and punch, that’s where the expert shines.
As for “Nitro-Glycerin” using gelatine, all I know
is that if you place a piece on an anvil and strike
it a moderate blow with the hammer, you’ll—as
the three-cards man said —be considerably surprised.
HE KNEW.
POET: “Ah, the mysterious spell of the bush! Don’t you ever feel that you can never
ever drag yourself away from it?”
COCKY: “Gripes, yes. I’ve got two mortgages on the farm, and Em a year behind with
my account at O'Grady’s.”
“Sylvester”: Apropos the late discussion
on swamp-cancer. I use white arsenic for warts
on stock (it’s a certain cure), and recently I tried
it on a swamp-cancer that had not reached the
bleeding stage, dusting the dry arsenic on just as
in the case of warts. The cancer was gone in two
weeks.
* * * *
“B” : Another shearing record comes from
Mangaohane station, Taihape (M.L.). Eight shearers
barbered 2451 sheep in eight hours 50 minutes,
averaging 306 per man. They were all Hawkes
Bay men and their individual tallies were: Ned
Hawkins 340, George Paul 333, C. Mansfield 318,
Pike 313, B. Stuart 301, Morgan 288, Dawson
284, O’Connor 274. The sheep were all large, and
carried heavy coats.
“The Deacon”: “Centre” (B. 8/2/’23),
who lost his quid on the exact pound-cutting butcher,
would have done his cash equally easy on a little
girl who presides in a cake dispensary at the
top of William-street (Sydney). Any day you can
see her carve off an exact pound or two, or three,
of plain or varnished fruit-cake, and the scale
just delicately oscillates to a fraction. This is
a much more difficult feat than dealing with bull
flesh.
* * * *
“EY7”: A Trangie (N.S.W.) squatter,
recently puzzled by the loss of over 100 sheep, held
vigil and spotted a 6ft. goanna biting the nose off
a feeding jumbuek. On being shot and post-mortemed,
the brute yielded up several more sheep’s noses. This
seems to be the first recorded case of a go. tackling
a free sheep, though the crawler’s horrible assaults
on bogged stock in bad seasons are only too well
authenticated. In the St. George (Q.) country I
have seen a dozen helpless but live sheep with the
soft and exposed parts eaten out by the scavengers.
A hungry goanna will, if undisturbed, literally eat
his way into a living beast's body in search of the
entrails, which he prefers to the flesh proper.
“Island Ike”: Re “E.K.’s” scrub-turkey
eggs that hatched in tumblers (B. 22/2/’23). Half-
a-dozen scrub-turkey eggs and one scrub-hen egg were
taken on Percy Island, 70 miles outside Mackay
(Q.), and were kept two weeks exposed to the air,
after which they were brought to Mackay and kept
for another week, similarly exposed. The turkey
eggs were then blown and a start was made on the
scrub-hen egg, but as soon as air was forced into it
a squeaking could be heard inside. A piece of paper
was promptly pasted over the hole, and the egg
was set on some shavings. Within four days it
hatched, and the chicken was reared and set at
liberty. The precocious youngster could fly when
only two days old.
“Girofla”: Re “Gottem’s” rhinorat (B.
22/2/’23). The nasal “horn” is probably cancerous,
such growths being very common among animals,
especially the rodents. The foul fungating growths
on the udders of cows and goats aie mostly of the
same nature. The horny variety results from slow
and constant proliferation of the skin cells, and is
rather commonly found among stock, particularly
o-i t’’e noses of cows. The foul type results when
the cancer grows rapidly and becomes infected by
, p.uuaCing organisms. Of course, the horn of
“Gottem’s” rat may be a deformity that arose dur-
ing the foetal development of the animal. Inciden-
tally, rats are the only animals upon which cancer
can be successfully grafted.
“Three E’s” op two shes:—
So women’s legs .are now to be decorated with
butterflies and bees, painted in natural colors on
the bare flesh, and revealed through transparent
stockings. Why bother about stockings ? Our
black- and brown-skinned sisters have been doing
the same stunt for generations, and they don’t trouble
to cover up their legs—except with the colored clay
they use as paint. Sydney and Paris fashions, as far
as women are concerned, can’t beat the long-estab-
lished customs of the New Guinea natives. Miss Syd-
ney wears as little as possible at all times (I’m not
blaming her), and, after dark, displays more than she
covers from the w r aistline upwards. She wears metal
and other bracelets, armlets and leglets; she bobs and
dyes her hair; she paints her tace and lips, and
powders herself more or less all over with something
perfumed to tickle the fancy of the male; her ears
MARY’S LITTLE MEAL.
“Why you bin drinkit all the rum, Maty?”
“ Min’ tinkit I bin bery hungry.”
are pierced for ear-rings ; around her neck she hangs
bead necklac es; on her fingers are rings; and on her
head she sticks feathers and other decorations. The
New Guinea native girl does all that, though perhaps
not quite to the same extent. She also has the nose
pierced for the ring or bar, and there’s' little doubt
that Miss Sydney will follow that too. But where
the raw,. brown girl scores is with her teeth. She
wears her own —those which grew with her, unfilled,
uncrowned, unspoiled and intact —but that’s because
she doesn’t lunch off ice-creams and (igarettes, swill
cocktails, and perform similar fool-stunts because
they’re supposed to be smart. In the meantime I’m
on the lookout, every time I go down Pitt-street, for
the first white girl with the nose-ring. It’s sure to
come.
(Continued on page 24.)
WHEN MURPHY’S PUB WENT DRY.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
The pride of Buckingingee, the centre and the hub
Of all the local gaiety, was Michael Murphy's pub.
Its glory’s gone, departed, like sunshine from the sky,
lor Local Option’s done its worst and Buckin-
gi ogee’s dry.
The night before the pub was closed Mike Murphy
gave a spree,
With dancing in the dining-room, and all the
drinks were free;
The young men from the township, from all the
stations near,
Came crowding into Murphy’s bar to finish Murphy’s
beer.
Tlie parish priest, Con Dolan —we called him Father
Con—
Was full of beer and jollity, his face with humor
shone ;
He offered his condolences to Murphy, and he said:
“Although intinded for the Church I’m at the
Bar instead.
“Assist the boys to help themselves the Church will
always do,
And so I’m here at Mike’s request to help in
helping you.
We’ll do our best for Michael too, a mimber of me
flock,
And wind up Murphy’s business by taking Murphy’s
stock.”
To represent a publican or guide a sinner on
The narrow track of righteousness there’s none
like Father Con.
He’d kiss a pretty country girl—sure ’tis the
father’s right—•
And take his liquor with the boys or referee a fight.
We’d finished all the bottled ale in drinking to
our host ;
The beer pump gave a gurgling scream, went dry,
gave up the ghost.
No sadder sound was ever heard ; oft will the good
priest tell
’Twas like the Banshee’s warning call, that beer-
pump’s dying yell.
Mike Murphy sprang upon his bar, scared by the
horrid sound ;
His shaking finger pointed out green rabbits play-
ing round,
And Where upon the bar-room floor a grisly wowser
sat,
His whiskers dripping human gore, blue flames
around his jiat.
ENVY.
“ 'E says 'e'll yet about fifty quid for it.”
“My eath, ’Is union must be pretty strong!”
The Diggers thought ’twas shell-shock : they hadn’t
any doubt
When Murphy seized a bottle and laid Tim Gro-
gan out.
And there were all the makings of a most impres-
sive row
When Grogan struggled to his feet and yelled,
“Let’s at the cow.”
We gave first-aid to Grogan, but Mike put up a fight
With Father Con, who blessed him first, then
crossed him with his right;
So Mike went peacefully to sleep, and when at last
he woke
His pub and stock had disappeared in roaring
flames and smoke.
The lamps were broken in the fight; the cellar
’r/eath the bar
Was full of Boom’rang brandy and Hennessy’s
Three Star;
The liquors mixed, and. blended with flaming kero-
sene
Produced a blaze that swept the site of Murphy's
old shebeen.
Our town’s defunct, its spirit's gone, and, what is
worse, its beer ;
The thirsty swaggie slouches past, the place is
dull and drear.
Two crumbling chimneys, standing lone and stark
against the sky,
Are all that’s left to mark the spot where Murphy's
pub went dry.

The Favourite Brand
Among all good judges 333
are the favourites.
Their quality is always
uniform—owing to the fine
selected leaves that are
used and the entire absence
of sand ? and dust in their
manufacture.
The result is a fragrant
and delicate cigarette —a
positive joy to smoke.
You can always recognise
them in the famous red
packets.

“Cfflsar”: Tell “Widgee” (B. 8/2/’23)
that there’s one old horse up at Monsildale (qp >
which has a hair-trigger sense of danger where fail-
ing trees are concerned. A pommy who took him
out to get a load of wood halted the cart under a
tree. Then he felled the tree —into the cart. Now
you’ve only got to make a hit at a tree to see the
old prad streak.
# # * *
“Test Tube” : I can substantiate “Morob’s”
statement (B. 22/2/’23) re caries in natives; but he
might have gone further and pointed out that there
is a marked difference between the bush and salt-
water native, even on the one island. The salt-
water native gets outside a lot of tinned mush
these days, but his bush brother is not so fortu-
nate!?). I found, in many months of investigation,
that y bad mouth in the bush is the exception. I
was rarely called upon to extract a tooth; but,
on the coast, where the traders do good biz in
tinned tack, neuralgia is common and extractions
many. The better general health of the bushman,
1 think, is largely due to the .fact that his stomach
is not called upon to accommodate large quantities
of germ-laden saliva, with it" attendant evils.
* * * *
“Country Bed” on another yellow peril:—
Eastern Riverina farmers need to guess again if they
think the saffron-thistle will disappear as mys-
teriously as it came (B. 15/2/’23). They will have
to get to work with hoe, mattock, scythe and
mower, and burn up the cut stems, if they don’t
want to suffer the same fate that is surely over-
taking Northern Vic. There the pest, though pro-
claimed under the Thistle Act for the whole State,
is fast capturing the country. The only sure way
to keep it in check is thorough cultivation —-and
then it takes years to eradicate the weed —though
the other methods are good in the early stages of
the invasion. It has spread so alarmingly in Vic.
simply because landholders have been apathetic and
lazy where the Shire Councils haven’t enforced the
Act, or else they have been defiant when the

screw has been put on. Many farmers have cheer-
fully paid £lO fines annually on the wilfully
blind assumption that that was cheaper than pay-
ing men 10s. a day to cut the thistles out. They
are feeling rather foolish about it nowadays, as
they see the carrying capacity of their properties
getting less every year. “H.L.N.” is correct in say-
ing this thistle is useless as fodder —that is, except
in drought times. I know a small grazier, one of
the annual finepavers, who fed his . sheep on the
leaves by using a horse to drag a very heavy chain
over the plants, thus pulling off the leaves and pul-

verising the prickles. The reason for the appearance
of the thistle in Eastern Riverina need be no mys-
tery if the farmers there have used chaff from
Northern Vic. within the last two or three years.
Chaff cut from thistle-infested hay is simply full of
saffron-thistle seeds.
“Mac” : Another queer accident. On Buc-
carumbi station (N.S.W.), stockmen were forcing
a mob of cattle across a stream, when the handle of
one man’s whip broke. The top half with the thong
shot to the rear, striking an abo. riding a few
yards away. The splintered end of the handle
went through his eye and penetrated the brain.
He was taken into Grafton Hospital, but died
a few hours later.

“D.” : The Sydney branch of the R.S.P.C.A.
has justified its exist-
ence if only by pre-
venting the feeding of
live creatures to rep-
tiles at the Zoo. I
once saw a live fowl
fed to a python, and
the memory continues
to wander obscenely
in the chambers of my
brain. At the first
sight of the python
the bird fainted —liter-
ally fainted. After a
while it came to, but
was still too weak to
stand. Its head wa3

it knew what was

evident by the shivers
which convulsed it.

violent death is prob-
ably- painless; and to
99 animals out of
every ioo the loss of
life can be no depriva-
tion. I am personally
acquainted with many
that would be happier
dead. But the antici-
pation of death is ap-
parently as agonising
to them as it might be
to a human being.

“Jimmy Possum”: I can’t tell “Bullet” (B.
18/l/’23) what would be the effect of substituting
high-pressure powder ahd a pointed bullet for the
standard load in the .22-calibre long-rifle cartridge, but
I can tell him the result of substituting a .32 Win-
Chester leaden bullet for the nickel-capped .303 mili-
tary bullet. I don’t like skiting, but when the
experiment was made I could, with the ordinary
equipment, drop my kangaroo at 300yds., and clip
a pigeon’s head at 50 paces with a satisfying degree
of certainty. Yet, when I swapped bullets one day, and
fired a leaden Winchester .32 from a military rifle
at an 18in. honeysuckle 40yds. away, I only hit
the atmosphere. My mate, a better shot than my-
self if anything, laughed at my marksmanship. Then
he tried—and knocked a sheet of bark off a blood-
wood'some distance to the side of the tree aimed,
at. Our idea was that the soft leaden bullet, owing
to the heavier charge and the higher pressure powder,
failed to follow the rifling, and, being forced across
the grooves, was much pared down when it left the
muzzle. Such a bullet would fly wide and topple
in its flight. The amount of lead we cleaned out
of the .303 afterwards backed up the theory of
the missiles jumping the rifling.
“Azrim”: Re “Exul” (B. 15/2/’23) on
snake venom in the eye. There is a Kaffir tradi-
tion that a S’African reptile, after leaping high
into the air, expectorates its venom into optics,
causing blindness ; but .Noguchi, who investigated
the matter for the Rockefeller Institute, was un-
able to find one authentic case supporting the legend.
After sifting the evidence and performing numerous
experiments he concluded that there was no truth
in the yarn, since (1) only a small amount of venom
could enter the optic aperture; (2) most of this
would be immediately removed by the involuntary-
winking; (3) any poison remaining would be washed
away shortly afterwards bv the flow of tears, since
the venom is slightly irritating. In his experiments
nothing untoward happened, except a mild con-
junctivitis which rapidly responded to treatment.
The large protein molecule was practically unab-
sorbed ; and even in special absorbing surfaces, such
as the intestine, it must first be broken into
polypeptides or amino-acids.
“George R.”: When a kangaroo-dog runs
riot on a sheep-walk the mutton bill tots up quickly.
In the Plantagenet district (W.A.) two of these
destroyers, a dog and a slut, hunting in a five-mile
circle for three nights, killed 85 sheep and badly
mauled 27 others. The killing was done for sport,
none of the jumbucks being broached for food.
By-the-way, what is the Council’s record of slaughter
by a ’roo-dog with a fancy for sheep?
* » * *
“Raupo”: “lI.V.E.’s” surprise at black-
bream living in fresh water (B. I/2/’23) surprises
me. In 1891 we used to catch fine big fat black-
bream and golden perch in the Darr River (YV.Q.),
a matter of about 300 miles from the briny. And I don’t
think the fish are peculiar to that gutter.
Maybe they have seen the error of their wowseristic
ways since my day, and now prefer their daily
lubrication with more bite in it.
“The Overlander”: I consider “Mulligan”
(B. l/2/’23) no novice in selecting camping grounds
for travelling cattle; but he says that when a bul-
lock gets up for a walk round on a soft camp,
and finds that none of the others do likewise, he,
conforming to the will of the majority, will lie
down contentedly- again. I’m afraid “Mull’s” cattle
must have been through a severe course of etiquette.
Throughout my experience, most cattle, after getting
up, have given several of their bovine friends
a poke in the ribs, thus disturbing their rest, no
matter how soft the camp, and evoking many- a
curse from a carolling night-watcher. I once saw a
thousand head beneath a very full moon churn a
soft camp to a powder-bin, not through fright,
but for sheer joyousness, bounding, prodding and
playing for two hours at least before they steadied
down. The dust of their corroboree mantled every-
thing, including the boiled beef that the cook had
left uncovered on the seat of the cart, thus causing
a storm of expletives a couple of miles long from
the babbler next morning. “Mull” says vehicles
are never used in far-west and nor’-west Queens-
land. Since when? And 1 wouldn’t mind betting
that some old-time drovers did build fires around
their cattle on camp, mainly in the depth of winter,
when they served a double purpose. But the
idea of a ring of lighted lanterns is new to me.
“Nimshi”: In connection with the
“regional nature of diseases” (B. 15/2/’23), I
recall that a high percentage of cancer cases was
at one time noticeable in thickly-timbered dis-
tricts, the inference being that humans were liable
to contract the dreadful scourge through living in
close proximity to trees. It would be interesting
to learn whether any theory on the subject has
been substantiated, or otherwise, by research.
* * * ' »
“Ned Kelly”: I can support “Te Whare”
(B. 22/2/’23) when he says that a black snake
with a dirty white belly is only a color variation,
and not a distinct variety. But he seems to Suggest
that they are extremely rare, whereas round about
Cobargo, Dry River and Yowrie (N.S.W.) they are
too frequently met with for any special notice to be
taken of them. A few years back, the school
teacher at Cobargo had in the same jar a young
white-bellied female black-snake and two red-bellied
young ones that he had captured with her.
“Tomb”: Is it to late to hand “J.
Trousers” (B. 14/12/’22) a further tip in his soap-
lessness ? Let him get acquainted with a tree
generally known as red ash ( Alphitonia excelsa),
and he will immediately bid adieu to the brother-
hood of the great unwashed. The leaves, used
in lieu of soap, produce a fine lather and are
most efficacious in the removal of dirt.
* * * *
“32x40”: “W.D.G.” (B. 8/2/123) gives an
instance of a pack-horse lasting 10 or 12 days
without water. In 1908 a terrific fire on Vergemont
station (Q.) drove a mob of brumbies over the rab-
bit fence on to an adjoining station, Warbreecan,
which was at the time absolutely waterless. Six
weeks later, out of 18, there was still one alive, a
buck. He was carefully watered and nursed by a
boundary-rider, and eventually made a good pack-
horse. The incident happened during cool weather.
* * * *
“Wilfrido”: A haka is being performed by
the Ngatiawa Maoris over the finding of a native
axe at Pukearuhe. It has been identified as being
the famous Potamawhiria, lost for centuries, and
originally brought to M.L. in the war canoe Toko-
maru. Much slaughter is said to have been
occasioned by this weapon —15in. long and 4in.
broad —and it is, of course, tapu, having with Hori
a legendary significance as great as that of the
grand Excalibur or of the magic sword of the Got-
terdammerung. A tribal gathering has been arranged
for Waitara, and there the history of the
axe will be narrated with appropriate gestures,
food and flowers of poesy.
* * * *
“McJ.”: This is an entry for either the
queer-accident or coincidence events. A few days
ago some chaps were passing this way and camped
here for the night. Next morning two of their
horses were found on their backs in a water-race
18in. wide and 3ft. deep. They were within 10ft. of
each other, and were in exactly the same position.
They were evidently rolling when they got into the
race, and in their struggles worked themselves to
the bottom of it. When released they were very
groggy and in great pain.
UP FROM THE COW COUNTRY.
“These city fellers don't keep their milk-
cans very tidy.”
“Nugget” : I recently came across a small
ironbark which had had the unique experience of
being blown down and. after many years, blown,
up again. It was but little better than a sapling
when a combination of wind, rain and loose soil
brought about its downfall. It didn’t die, but
sent up a sucker from its roots. In the course of
time the youngster became bigger and heavier than
his parent and then he, too, got pushed over by a
frisky westerly. Superior weight did the trick and
tree No. 1 was raised to a very passable imitation
of the perpendicular. No doubt this enterprising
ironbark is rather proud of his victory over the
elements, but from the way he sways and creaks
in the slightest breeze he is likely to split off
from his offspring and crash again. When the
crash does come will he try the same stunt, or
has he something fresh up his sleeve?
GETTING ACCUSTOMED.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
I saw her in the burial-place,
A stout and florid dame,
Yet touched she seemed with sorrow’s grace,
And I was much the same.
It seemed to me an inference fair
Some love of hers lay buried there.
I spoke the seventh time we met
Beside the blossomed grave.
I said ’twas sad to lose them, yet
YVe lost them but to save.
She groaned in tensity of gloom,
And took her seat upon a tomb.
“I have no husband buried here,”
The solemn lady said.
“I do not mourn a baby dear,
My sister is not dead;
But when I die, here where I sit
fl'hey’ll bury me, and, bit by bit,
I’m seeking to get used to it!”

Lady Davidson and Miss Henderson looked
in at the Naval House the other afternoon
when the Friendly Union was farewelling
Mrs. Edwards and Mrs. Starr, wiping a tear
away with one hand, while handing out a
smile of welcome with the other to the new
Commander Craufurd’s wife. She, by the
way, is tall and slight, and was pearl-grey
silk from her hat downwards. The savings
box of the Friendly Union must be pretty
well bankrupt, for ducky little bowpots were
handed to all the principal guests, from her
Ex. downwards. Miss Henderson came in
for one, too, not to speak of a welcome that
hit the roof, for the sailor’s lass has a very
soft spot for Miss Henderson. Mrs. Edwards,
Mrs. Starr and Airs. Craufurd were others
of the flower-gathei’ers, and the Commodore’s
wife and Mrs. Starr, who is also leaving for
England, were surprised beyond speech by
each receiving a dainty platinum wristlet
watch. The new Commander, the girls will
be interested to learn, has brown hair with
a natural curl in it.
The Feminist Club got out the big drum
last week for the opening of its first real
home. It has secured the old Ad. Men’s
quarters in the basement of Culwulla
Chambers, and that prettily shaped, pan-
elled and infernally hot room more or less
accommodated about 300 Feminists and their
friends for the house-warming. Miss I’res-
ton-Stanley, who is the queen-pin of the
club, disclosed a very suave dress policy.
She wore black charmeuse and gold tissue
built according to the newest fashion-archi-
tect, and she wore her black hair dressed
high in a blue-black wave that would have
convicted her on sight in a Bolshevist coun-
try. The night’s entertainment was music
and jazz cut in halves by a supper that
was conveyed to the consumers by as great
a miracle as that which fed Elijah in the
desert —trays seemed to float in mid-air,
above the standing-room-only crowd, and then
nose-dive with not a sandwich split. It
was so bewildering that nobody had a chance
to really see the beautiful brasses and
antiques that De Groot and Tyrrells had
loaned to give the party an air. The can-
vases lent by Gayfield Shaw fared better
as they were nailed to the mast, so to
speak, and no expanse of melting flesh
could hide them from view. Ruby R cli
hostessed in artistic dull-blue draperies, and
Ruby Adams emerged very slim and French-
looking from a frock that was mostly tussocks
of vari-colored tulle. Mrs. Lachlan Beaton’s
frocking was all soft golden brown tones;
poetess Dora Wilcox dug into a corner; the
Osborne Englands were plainly visible, which
is the advantage of height in a crowd; and
Theo Cowan moved gently in blue and gold
frocking. Presently the supper dishes were
shoved into the sink, somebody ripped up
the carpet, and. perspiring couples clutched
each other gladly.
Dame Margaret, piloted by Miss Hender-
son, dashed down from Sutton Forest mid-
way through last week to preside at the
annual meeting of the R.S.P.C.A. The Ani-
mals’ Friends celebrated a jubilee this year,
and after the conventional show of hands it
was decided to jubilate at a ball in the Pad-
dington Town Hall during May. After her Ex.
and R.S.P.C.A. president Acocks had made
a short appeal on behalf of our dumb friends,
the business was got through at Marathon
speed. In the afternoon her Ex. took in
the Naval House gathering, and evening
found her once more at Sutton Forest.
The office-boy must have forgotten to post
the invitations for the opening of the Society
of Architects’ Exhibition, for the long gal-
lery in the Education buildings was almost
as clear of traffic as a bowling alley. Only
small groups of the initiated hovered about
the striking designs for public buildings and
the charming pictures of homes in the mak-
ing. Of these latter there are too few;
there should be enough to draw hosts of
newly-engaged lads and lasses. Director of
Education Smith pushed the show on its
way with an acadejnic blessing that didn’t
include a word about the sumptuous carpet
that draped the wall at the back of the stage,
rippled over its boards and overflowed in
opulence to the floor. It looks as though it
might be loot from Tutankhamen’s Winter
Palace. A grey-green bowl of amaryllis
glowed softly pink against its wonderful
weave at each end of the stage. The nota-
bility among the visitors was the historical
Captain Watson, who at 80 retains the
enthusiasms of 20. Some of the younger men
show up well. There are three whose work
clamors for notice among the students. N. W.
McPherson is gifted with imagination; W.
H. Morris, of the Technical College, has a
good sense of color; and a pencil drawing
by F. H. Moloney has the right touch.
That little band of consistent workers
that calls itself the After-Care Association
and has for its object the kindly guardian-
ship of discharged mental patients held its
annual meeting the other day. The Cul-
len lady who presides lent Tregoyd for the
gathering, and after the business of elect-
ing the executive had been gone through the
meeting resolved itself into a gentle, reflec-
tive garden-party, when the very trees seemed
to breathe a large and roomy benevolence.
The After-Care Association carries on in
the Equitable Buildings, where subscriptions
will be welcomed.
When Australia began to collect a Navy
of her very own, one of the smart little craft
was named the Parramatta, and after it had
been duly christened the people of the his-
toric village presented it with a beautifully-
carved casket in which reposed a starry flag.
The casket bore the rope design so favored
of the woodworkers in Nelson’s day, and,
besides, it had anchors and gunnerv designs
cleverly cloven into its surface. The casket
was tbe work of Miss Makinson, and the
other day it was handed over to help orna-
ment the local Town Hall, for the Parra-
matta has gone the quick way of all war-
ships.
The Palmer-McLachlan nuptials made the
big noise of the week-end at Mosman. The
bride was Mabs, eldest daughter of the E. A.
Palmers, of Bradley’s Head, and the groom
is a product of the same home-making suburb.
Cloth of silver that blossomed into petalled
georgette at the sides formed the bulk of
the bridal outfit, and there were trimmings
in the way of a magnificent train and a
superfine Limerick lace veil. Bride’s two
sisters Wendy and Olive and bridegroom’s
sister Edith performed the time-honored ser-
vices to the leading lady—Wendy and Edith
in rose georgette over silver-tissue frocking,
while the small Olive was mostly a wreath
of roses and crepe de chine petals. An out-
size party afterwards made merry at the
Town Hall, Mrs. Palmer hostessing in a
shining armor of jet and silver. The honey-
moon will be spent on the Northern Rivers,
finishing off with a dash of Brisbane gaiety
just to put a bead on the millf-shake.
When Edith M. Jacobs, second daughter
of the Jacobs of Nerea, Summer Hill, who
has been connected with the Customs De-
partment for seven years, resigned her job
last week, giving as reason her threatened
marriage with John H. Hodgson, jun., ship-
ping manager of Hoffnung and Co., she had
to have heln to carry home a tea service,
an entrde dish, and the spoons that the
dish runs off with. Mr. Barclay made the
presentation, but his nice speech of gmd
wishes was entirely outclassed by the bride-
to-be’s happy little reply. Hodgson, sen., is
well known at the “House” as the shipping
manager of Anthony Horderns’, and away
from there is a Royal Art Society exhibitor.
The new Leader of the Parliamentary
Labor Party, imposed upon it by some un-
known gentlemen outside of it, doesn’t
possess all the brains
of the family. Mrs.
McGirr, who is
shown in the photo,
alongside, can throw
in some palpitating
grey matter on her
own account. Be-
fore marriage she
was Rachel Miller-
Heumes; a native of
West Maitland, she
received most of her
school training at St.
Scholastica’s, Glebe-
point, whose path-
way led her to Syd-
ney Uni., where she
graduated B.A, in
1912. Her particu-
lar line was phil-
osophy—and Heaven
knows a politician’s wife needs a deal of it.
Mrs. McGirr’s chief hobby is the Bush Nursing
Association. She’s a J.P., too, and if that
isn’t sufficient for complete happiness she has
five bonny kiddies—one boy and four lasses.
The Loughborough lordling and his lady
and Mrs. Ernest Watt were the platinum-
set voyagers by the outgoing Nestor. Society
arrived in droves to waggle a streamer, and
social aspirants who couldn’t say farewell in
the flesh did so in waggon-loads of flowers—
enough to unholster a really first-class
funeral. Ernest Watt had set knives and
forks at the Cavalier for a very “swish”
dinner a few nights before in honor of his
wife; the decorations ran to floworing rose-
bushes and flowing bowls and such like. Mrs.
Vivers also handed round a strictly limited
number of platters and at the
Wentworth in honor of the same golden-
haired party.
The mother of a remarkable family died
at Ivillara on Friday. One of her sons is
the famous Egyptologist, Dr. Elliot Grafton
Smith, Professor of Anatomy at London Uni-
versity. Another has recently become Direc-
tor of Education in N. S. Wales. The old
lady w'ho had lived among school-books all
her life, was 81 at the last.
A dear old lady, Mrs. Mary Thompson,
who died a few days ago at Nowra, was a
connecting link with the State’s first Par-
liament under responsible government. A
native of the Shoalhaven River, she was a
daughter of Dr. Mackenzie, one of the
South Coast’s pioneers. But she had lived
at Burrier all the years of her long married
life; and her husband, James Thompson,
was chosen M.P. for St. Vincent as far back
as April 10, 1856.
Here’s a new May Moore picture of Mrs.
A. V. Roberts, the president of the Sunset
Homes scheme. If this happy idea meets
with the success it deserves, old couples
who have been caught by the ruthless hand
of Poverty and pushed relentlessly to the
doorstep of organised Charity will no longer
be dragged apart—
he to pass the dusk
in company with
other old men who
are strangers to him,
she with a group of
women equally
strange and terrify-
ing. If the Sunset
Hi mies multiply as
they should, each old
couple will end their
days in each other’s
company amid their
own household gods.
Arthur Rickard has
given a block of land
at Warrimoo for the
site of the first cot-
tages ; they will be
run on much the
same lines as the Old
Colonists’ Homes in Fitzroy (Melb.), and
will have a garden plot just big enough for
“father” to grow a few potatoes and where
“mother” can gather a handful of holly-
hocks.
Mrs. Walter Keigwin, who used to be
Kitty Shannon, and is a daughter of Sir
James, the R.A., has held an exhibition of
her work which has caught the eye of the
London critics. She is also illustrating a
book which will shortly be published. Sir
James, who is now an invalid and paints
from his chair, is engaged on a portrait of
Babs McQuade in her riding kit, which is to
be shown at the Academy next year. Babs
McQuade was one of Sydney’s most sporting
girleens, who attended the best fights at the
Stadium, and could steer a stripped motor-
car through Sydney’s most hectic traffic.
When Prof. David was addressing the
Royal Society at Hobart the other night he
enlarged on what Clive Lord, F.L.S., had
done to advance scientific work. “For in-
stance,” said David, “he is responsible for
my being here in a dress suit to-night.”
It turned out that the casual old Prof., in
packing up, hadn’t put in a coat to keep his
dress pants and vest company. And the
Lord had provided.
When he has finished his picture of the
Tirranria race meeting, in which several
of the familiar habitues will appear, George
Lambert, A.R.A., goes to a Queensland sta-
tion to paint a cattle picture. He is one of
the competitors, too, for the big War Memorial
at Port Said. George first started modelling
while recovering from fever in a hospital
at Cairo.
Stella Power (Mrs. O’Rourke), the one
protegee of whom Melba seems really fond,
sails for Australia this month, and will give
a series of concerts under the Gravestock
management. Baby O’Rourke and her hus-
band are coming with her. It will be baby’s
first visit to the sunshine of its mother’s
birthland.
Miss Hullin, who left a job as under-
housekeeper at Buckingham Palace to
“mother” 56 domestic helps who came by
the Jervis Bay, is a trim, precise, square-
toed little lady with a positive genius for
reticence. Anyone who still clings to the
notion that a woman can’t keep a secret
should just try Miss Hullin. The papers
sent their most practised news-extractors to
find out something about the daily round at
Buckingham Palace; or, that failing, any old
palace. In vain. Then, so the rumor runs,
a weekly offered her a job on the staff and
a pension for life in return for a series of
exposures of the Royal family, beginning
with the Prince. She merely wagged her
head placidly, and went on supervising the
removal of her boxes.
Quite a big bit of Sydney will be sorry to
learn of the death of Captain Simpson
Baikie. The tall and broad-shouldered man
who had been surveyor to Lloyds at Yoko-
hama for some years oast was in Sydney in
quest of his lost health about nine months
ago. He spoke then in a husky whisper, as
though something of the sea fog he' had so
often faced lingered in his throat. His wife
before her marriage was Constance Brandon-
Usher, well known in artistic circles.
Scarba, the Welfare Home for Children
at Bondi, will blossom into a garden-party
and fete on Saturday next (17th) for the
purpose of installing electric lights through-
out the roomy holiday home.
“The Sex Synonym in Art,” by Norman
Lindsay, will be the star introduction in
Vision, a new quarterly which makes its
first appearance in April. The line decora-
tions which will embellish the pages of the
first number are also from Norman’s pen.
The editors and publishers of the flamboyant
enterprise are Jack Lindsay, Kenneth Sles-
sor and Frank Johnson. Just to give it
a send-off, Hugh McCrae, who, despite a
grown-up daughter, is still one of “us fel-
lers,” has sent something for the first num-
ber, and Jack Lindsay. Slessor, Fritz Burnell
and others will have their exotic say, and be
blowed to the buying public that wants to
read plain English !
Dick Horsfall, who married Eustace Fos-
bery’s sister, has joined the growing colony
of moneyed Australians who have settled in
England. He has become a racing-owner
in a small way, and watches the perform-
ances of his three or four horses at places
like Lingfield and Kempton Park. His
nephew, Rupert Carington—now a captain
in the Grenadier Guards, and married —was
looked on with an envious eye by the match-
making mothers of Sydney just before the
war. The young man is heir to the huge
estates of old Rupert Carington’s octoge-
narian brother, the Marquis of Lincolnshire.
He is not heir, however, to the marquisate,
and will merely be a baron, as the first peer
—who began life with the name of Smith —
was in 1797.
De Giorgio was warmly welcomed back
at the Queen Victoria Club the other day—
Mrs. Geo. Taylor, Mrs. Hutchinson and
Mabel Batchelor were hostesses. The
Italian teacher felt the lure of Sydney even
when in his beloved Italy, and is glad to be
back among his prospective Melbas and
Clara Butts.
Stella Wootton, elder daughter of the
horsey Dick Wootton and sister of jockeys
Frank and Stanley, recently made her debut
on the professional concert platform in the
Wigmore Hall, London.
The Royal Hospital for Women is hold-
ing its own Fair in its own ground on the
23rd and the 24th. Chief Justice Cullen’s
gentle lady presidents the affair, and Josie
“Sally” Melville is to be auctioneer-in-chief,
He was a member of Sydney’s smartest
set, and he was wading through the dust
and rubble of what used to be Darlinghurst
Gaol, in a forlorn effort to find George
Lambert’s new’ studio. “Curse this place,”
he muttered. “It never has proved satis-
factory to members of my family.”
About the success of Miss M. E. Willcox
at recent exams, of the Institute of Account-
ants, the lady hates to be given any more
credit than she earned.. What she gained
was first place in the auditing exam... and
third place (missing second b’’ one mark) in
the complete intermediate exam, for N. S.
Wales —not the Commonwealth.
A few remarks from Brisbane: —
Sir Matthew gave some straight talk at the
Alexandra Home for kiddies. He advocated indi-
vidual homes and individual attention, “properly
supervised,” in preference to the ministi'ations of
any institution. He had an armful of bouquets to
throw at the staff and committee of the Alexandra:
for the system he had, metaphorically speaking,
naught but eggs.
His Ex. had something to say about Australian
art and literature at Wynnum West when he was
called upon to unveil portraits of Essex Evans, R.
J. Randall, Manson Bailey (who knew every kind
of wattle that grows in Australasia), and Jenner,
who painted icebergs from memory in midsummer.
Jenner, by the way, served.in the Crimean War.
The living lions whose photographs were officially
opened for inspection included Henri Tardent, who
wrote a life of Essex Evans, and A. J. Boyd, who
varied a journalistic career with much pioneering.
The Authors and Artists seized the United Service
club-room for a shivoo on the 7th. Steele Rudd
contributed short stories; artists Colelough and Bell
Booth gave lightning sketches; Nell Bbugjas-
Graham recited Mrs. Forrest’s “Moonrise,” and Bar-
bara Sisley proclaimed Essex Evans’s “Secret Key.”
And there was much besides, including R. J. Cassidy's
“Piker’s Pub,” a dissertation on place-names by
Cumbrae Stewart, and sandwiches.
W. B. McKenzie, who is departing in peace from
the Q. N. Bank at the Valley, was laden with a
gold watch, a case of pipes, a tobacco-pouch of
mighty girth, and a £l3O cheque, subscribed by a
few of the friends he has made during his 37
years’ service.
A startled engineer found 15 Chinese where he
expected to find only coal in the bunkers of the
Houtman as she passed the Pile Light in Moreton
Bay last week. The roll-call subsequently re-
vealed five more. They had crept aboard at Singa-
pore Two were dead- —one had been so for some
days—and the Black . Hole of Calcutta was as
nothing to the hiding-place. The living will be
returned to their overcrowded land as soon as pos-
sible.
The V.W.C.A. rooms had been swept and dusted
for the National Council of Women’s welcome to
Mrs. Cowan, M.L.A., of Westralia. That morning,
wearing brown silk jersey', with a brown and
yellow hat, she had been met at the Town Hall by
Mayor Diddams and a cup of tea. Tou must
always have a cup of tea in Queensland.

MISSESE MONKE DOVLE
Phones central 1533, 11609.
The vice-regal enclosure was Avell patron-
ised on Australian Cup day. The G.-G. and
Lady Forster had a party, and so had the
Stradbrokes. Lady Forster looked particu-
larly Avell in blue silk touched up with Bui
gajrian tones, with a lace and berry-adorned,
black hat. The Countess was in ivory-white
satin, finished with a postman-red hat tipped
with toque feathers. Mrs. Pitt-Rivers wore
the SAveetest thing in girlish tourquois-blue
organdie, and a large black hat. Mrs. Fred
Pelly wore henna morocain; Airs. Dugdale
grey satin lumineux and a black hat,
Aileen Bell (Queensland) a black one-piece
frock relieved with white and black velvet
toque.
Nell Stead struck a smart note in a lemon-
toned taffeta frock of a domino-board design.
Kathleen Agnew, Avhose brothers played for
Tasmania in the polo matches, went in for
sunset tones. Mrs. Eric Hill’s blush rose-
pink voile was relieved with a pastel-blue
and pink hat. Mrs. Ramsay (wife of Pay-
master-Commander Ramsay) stood out in
ciel-blue morocain; Edna Armytage, the
much-travelled daughter of Norman, looked
well in a black georgette trimmed Avith
paisley tones; Janet Knox’s cream frock
was crowned Avith a mushroom-shaped hat,
and the White lady was graceful in grey
silk georgette. General Chauvel’s dame chose
champagne tones; John Campbell, son of
the Ottawa Campbells of Toorak, was stroll-
ing proudly about with his bride (who was
pretty little Nell Chambers, the banker’s
daughter) ; and Mrs. George Blackwood was
a study in black georgette.
There Avas a belated spasm of lurid sun-
shine for the V.R.C. finals on Saturday. The
Vice-regal pen Avas again Avell stocked by
both Federal and State dignitaries and their
pals. Lady Forster flew grey frontings to
her blue silk, while Countess Stradbroke
had equipped herself for any temperature
with a filmy white georgette tunic
weighted with dusky embroiderings over
black velvet under-hangings. She had
a dash of red in her droopy hat. Mrs.
Pitt-Rivers wore a billoAyy blue and white
foulard, and silvery grey crinoline-straw
head-piece. Mrs. Bruce moved attractively
in a toga of cinnamon-brown crepe and a
glorified stringless quaker bonnet of a darker
shade. Three sets of checked kiltings under
heavy cloth coatings overheated the atmos-
phere in their near vicinity. One adven-
turous dresser struck a fiery sunset effect
in a coat of glittering steel under a wide
circumference of crimson hat brim. The
elder Everard BroAvne girl, trimly tailored,
suggested Julius Caesar—of the epoch when
Cicero used to refer to him as “that
woman.” Her finely chiselled Roman pro:
file Avas croAvned Avith a toquelet of brown
leaves, that looked exactly like her ancient
laurel wreath. Mrs. Grossmith affected her
grey embroideries and a crinoline straAV hat,
and her Lawrence his smartest Sackville-
street tailorings; the trousers almost
eclipsed the Prime Minister’s. Diana Wil-
son scored beauty honors in navy tailorings
with collared neck and lace fluttering across
her chest.
The party at Stoningt >n was a success.
The moon lifted up her lamp on high and
the terraced garden Avas splodged Avith ropes
of colored lights. It offered Romance for
the young and rheumatism for the mature.
Lady Strad. wore jade-green, and coiffed
her hair like the entrance of Port
Phillip, with a Point Nepean of locks
on one side and a Lonsdale on the
other guarding a sweep of broAA\ Her
pearls looked as if the Oyster Union had
been working overtime. Every second man
was a dinkum Aussie, and nearly every male
chest had a border of miniature medals. The
Priminister arrived with his spouse after the
House rose. Kathleen Osborne, of Sydney,
pleased the eye in blue and a sparkling
headpiece. Archie Maclaren talked of
Maoriland cricket, played to the accompani-
ment of earthquakes and geysers. His wife
was robed, like “dear little Buttercup,” all
in yellow. A Baillieu girleen in dawn-pink
was one of the prettiest buds. Richard Hat-
teras, the young Sultan from “Cairo,” draped
his tall good looks along the wainscoting.
Mrs. Sam McCaughey’s inky chiffons were
lit with diamente. There was late in the
evening an eruption of mummers led by
Hugh Ward. Miss “O’Brien” Watson
danced gracefully in pale apricot georgette,
while May Beatty gave an imitation of
Catherine of Russia in brocade and a defiant
turban. The polo players, Frank Downer,
Law Smith, Dudley Gibson, Ken Austin,
John Winter Irving and Tony Hordern,
attended in full force. Lady Pansy Digby’s
little figure is regrettably missing from these
racing junkets. She was very welcome
amongst the swains of this village. She
had the gift of making everyone feel witty.
At 11.30 Stanley Melbourne trod a digni-
fied measure with the Countess, while his
Ex. stood against the wall and passed the
time o’ day Avith Mrs. Bruce, mauve-satined
in long drapy swathings and an odd diamond
or so.
A great handshaking took place between
secretaries A. V. Hiskens and Harry Cres-
wick over the success of the recent polo
matches. Four dusty struggles were held,
and from a small attendance of Melbourne’s
naic'est-r-t-he numbers grew each day until, at
the final match, last Friday, several hundreds
motored to the"'grounds. Vice-royalty Avas
there every day. ' -No incident of the kind
they call untoward occurred until the last
day; then Eric Murray, Avhile doing fine
work for Adelaide, was playfully tapped on
the mouth by an opponent’s stick and had
his jaAv broken. With the' vice-regal crowd
each day were Mrs!. Pitt Rivers, Mr. and
Mrs. Pelly, Mrs. Dugdale and Miss Bell.
Liter-State and country visitors inundated
the grounds.
Frankston is in the boom, owing either
to the Prime Minister (he has a week-end
house on the Mornington-road) or to the
new golf course. Mr. Bruce has promised
those in his immediate vicinity that, if they
like to spend about £3O each, he will
guarantee a water-supply in less than 18
months, The idea is to build a reservoir
on the Mastertoiis’ place and pump the
water from it. Another attraction is the
new Country Club, now nearing completion.
When finished it Avill have an 18-hole golf
course, also a nine-hole, both surrounded
by beautiful scenery. There are to
be 25 tennis courts and an assortment of
croquet lawns and putting links. The club
is to have accommodation for ICO guests,
and it will swank with swimming baths, a
ball room and a billiard room. The noblesse
of Flindersdane is Avell represented in
Frankston. The Sargoods, Grimwades,
Andersons and Bedggoods Avere among those
Avho got in on the ground floor, and they are
not all taking kindly to some of the late-
comers.
For the first of this year’s monthly teas
given by the Soldiers’ Wives and Mothers’
Friendly Union, new Defence Minister Bow-
den’s wife sat on the stage in brown uphol-
sterings, with a pink rosette bristling fiercely
at the rear of her brown hat ledge. The
Chauvel dame, beautiful in blue, presided
in place of Lady Forster. Theo Roberts had
as usual provided the stars, with Zoe Alli-
son in the lead.
There is not a more strictly musical lady
in Australia than Miss Marjorie Hat-
chapd, who came a
year ago from Lon-:
don, where she
gained her diplomas
for singing and
piano fo rt e. She
studied singing under
Frederic King, Sir
H enry Wood and
Charles Kennedy
Scott, and pianoforte
with Felix Surnstead.
Her platform voice is
not “great,” nor does
. she sing down to the
popular eai-, but as a
genuine “highbrow”
Miss Hatchard is
a much esteemed
teacher. Ruth Hol-
lick took the photo.
Mrs. G. F. Hyde has been elected Presi-
dent of the Friendly Union of Sailors’
Wives. During the war she held a shore
job in the R.N. —chiefly coding and decoding
—qnd made a success of it. tier husband
follows Commodore Hardy as second mem-
ber of the Navy Board, and in sea-going
circles he is spoken of as Australia’s Hope.
Sam Mackay’s little missus, one of
Avhose sisters married George Grossmith,
asked her friends to the Oriental to be in-
troduced to George’s brother Lawi’ence and
his wife. The hostess wore her sweetest
smile under a brown velvet millinery tri-
umph, with ostrich feathers washing the
decks behind the front bulwarks. She was
enfolded in cinnamon brown georgette from
collar-bones to instep (bare chests have
faded out with abbreviated skirtings),
weighted with beaver fur effects. The femi-
nine guests were thrilled at the sight of a
narrow back train section which swept the
floor fully a yard in the rear. The Gros-
smith pair blew in nearly an hour after the
first curtain, full of explanations and apolo-
gies. Mrs. Lawrence floated round like a
misty cloud in grey chiffon, weighted with
embroideries,, with pale, pinky, blue flowers;
athwart a grey crinoline hat brim, and
grasped a presentation posy in the same tint-
ings. In a musical interval there w T as a
singles game between J. D. Brownlee and
Robert Chisholm. The latter, who yearns to
switch over from stage to concert platform,
showed magnificent form in the hackneyed
“Paghacci” solo, and warbled an Italian
lyrjc soulfully. But, sad to relate, his encore
trifle, “A Bachelor Gay,” was accorded the
heartiest welcome. Brownlee’s mighty
baritone boomed out musically in Ed.yth
Harrhy’s “Red-haired Bo’s’un” and “King
Charles.”
Mardi Syme staged a onestep last week
for a brace of bride-elect pals—Peggie For-
rester and Fon Ellison. Mrs. Geoff dressed
herself in black, buttressed with moonlight
beads; and she clothed her drawing-room in
pink floral effects, her dining-saloon in
blue delphiniums, and the rest of the Blythes-
wood parlors in hectic scarlet blossoms
against a green ferny background. Pi *
cactus dahlias rioted over the tables
dotted round the supper tent to keep in
touch with its rosy lining. Mardi was
armored in silver with green beads trickling
down the sides, while Peggy Forrester
revolved in apricot ninon hangings, and Fon
Ellison flew heavy headings from her pink
satin.
Fon Ellison, who is marrying Douglas
Shaddock, of Adelaide, in April, intends to
have a white-and-gold wedding. Clive For-
rester is seeing the bridegroom through, and
little niece Betty Shafckell has been cast
for the r6le of train-holder. The bride, by
the way, is having three rooms furnished
by a fairy godmother.
The Stradbrokes are returning to their here-
ditary acres this month, just by way of a
refresher, leaving their daughters to fol-
low on a couple of weeks later by a cheaper
route. They are an agreeable pair, who just
like to enjoy life. Even their frivols at Ston-
ington have been the ordinary Toorak-
etty young people’s twirls. The moan of
the wowser is occasionally to be heard on
the subject. An imported cocked hat, it is
claimed, could make itself felt, if it was
deliberately worn Avith that object.
Charlie Templeton is giving up his many-
sided billet of Master in Lunacy and Equity
and Examiner of Titles for a legal job with a
big city corporation. Charles is a brother of
Colin, and joined up as a gunner in 1915.
Their cheerful little mother is still moving
briskly after passing her eightieth milestone.
She was a sister of the late. William Mitchell,
and is aunt to the present MitchelJ knight,
and Lauchie Mackinnon is a cousin on
another side of the house. Maurice Phil-
lips and F. L. D. Homan share C. L. Tem-
pleton’s jobs.
Mrs. Edmund Brov/n’s surveyor-husband
Avent west on March 6 at Berringama. He
hever got over the strain of the war years,
Avhen his three sons and a brace or step-
sons (John and Ray Tovell) Avere aAvay
soldiering. One Brown son and a Tovell
stepson never returned. His widoAV (whose
first husband, Dr. Tovell, passed out many
years ago) was one of the Albury Mitchell
squatting clan, a sister of the late Peter
Mitchell and Mrs. .Willie Chisholm of Syd-
ney. The Mitchell family was plunged into
mourning some days previously by the death
of John Mitchell of Ravenswo'od; the last* of
the pioneering brothers Avho owned half the
sheep-lands around Albury.
Dr. Charlie Ryan’s lady is going back to
her soldier son, Rupert, and his pretty, blue-
eyed sister Maie. The latter is, for the
time being, keeping house for the young man
in Germany. He is stationed at Cologne
Avith the Army of Occupation.
Dr. Middleton,. who went south with the
Shackleton Relief Expedition, has given a
diamond ring to Miss Annie Dyer, of
Rupanyup, and will add a plain gold one
to the collection very shortly.
The fareAvell conversazione to Frank and
Mrs. Tate was more of a demonstration than
a social send-off. Everybody who is any-
body was there, and crowds of enthusiastic
nobodies helped to swell the throng. It was
one of those rare occasions when gratitude
wakes up and is articulate. Over and over
again Tate has taken his job in his hand—
and risked the sack—in the cause of reform,
and that sort of pluck is admired. Chief
Secretary Baird, who has been one of Tate’s
Cabinet critics, was generous enough to come
along as the Ministry’s mouthpiece, and lead
the chorus of appreciation.
The household helps who arrived aboard
the Jervis Bay were chaperoned by Miss
Annie Hullin, who for 16 years was “in ser-
vice” in the George and Mary household.
The Prince was a happy-vo-lucky knicker-
bockered youngster when she first made the
beds at Marlborough House. For the past
seven years she has been assistant house-
keeper at Buckingham Palace. Miss Mullin
is here on a visit to a sick relative.
Mrs. Gerald Bacon (her stage name was
Lilian Meyer) is back from New York.
She startled every one on Australian Cup
day by wearing round her neck a red, yellow

Eileen Hamilton, Arthur Robb’s eldest
daughter (she and her husband have
a farm down Gippsland way), was half-
stunned the other day by the cable news that
a Hamilton uncle had left her small sop
£Booo—the income to go to her husband and
herself during their lifetime. The money came
from the sale of an Irish property w r hich had
been in the family for centuries. The Ham-
iltons are now at Mornington, recuperating.
A similar windfall has befallen the Greig
family. Actor Bob’s elder sister, Mrs. John-
ston, who went back to London a year or two
ago with her English husband, has just
written to say that the latter’s uncle has
died and left him £BOO a year.

A word from Adelaide:—
The Black Cat fete, opened by Lady Bridges jn
the Exhibition, is to add about £lOOO to the
funds of the Tubercular Soldiers’ Aid Society. It
was under the patronage of Minister of Repatria-
tion Laffer, with Miss Cleggett as secretary and
fejninine committees from half the business houses
in Adelaide as organisers and stall-holders. Lady
Bridges brought small daughter Alvida with her and
dispensed with A.D.C.s in favor of Miss Judge.
Doris Egerton Jones was tea-ed at the Queen
Adelaide Club during her brief visit here, with Dr.
Helen Mayo and Miss Mary liitson as joint hostesses
and Mrs. Slaney Poole, Dr. Violet Plummer, Miss
Dorothea Pavey, Miss Harriet Stirling and Miss
Darnley Naylor amongst the old friends invited to
...meet ..her..
The Women’s Club, which began life under the
sheltering wing of the Y.W.C.A., but has been an
independent show for the last couple of years, has
moved itself to bigger and conveniently placed roorris
in Hindley-street. The change was effected in
four days, including a Sunday, which isn’t bad
going.
Una, daughter of the W. F. Parkers, of Buckalow
station, Broken Hill, is engaged to Edgar, second of
the W. L. Davidson sons.
It won’t be the Rymills’ fault if the motor-boat
championship leaves this State. The American de-
signer of. the Tortoise is sending them designs for
a new Tortoise (the Baby Tortoise this time), which
will be built here and fitted with the engine of the
smashed Tortoise. It is expected to travel at 10
miles or so an hour.
There is a slump in theological students, and the
Parkin. Trust bemoans its half-empty college. The
only consolation they find is in the fact that most
other churches are in the same boat; the hard work
and poor pay of the average “living” isn’t attrac-
tive to the modern young man.
The Elder Conservatorium began its 1923 session
with a tea-party in the Elder Hall, plus an address
from Professor Harold Davies and a demonstration
by W. H. Foote on the woodwind and other in£Au-
ments that have come from England for the
Conservatorium’s orchestra. Concerts are to be
mostly in the second and third terms this year, to
'leave a clearer run when examinations loom ahead.
The engineers of Australia met in Ade-
laide last week, with Prof. Chapman as their presi-
dent. South Aus. had not many engineering feats to
show them, apart from the Murray reclamation work.
But they saw what there was, and a reception by
Mayor Cohen and visits to sundry vineyards filled
in the week.
V. E. A. Brown, for 10 years secretary
of the Commercial Travellers’ Club here —he was
president of a similar club in Melbourne when the
Adelaide billet attracted him—has resigned, to go
into business. The members presented him with
office furniture at parting, and said they were glad
he was going to stay in Adelaide. Then Mr. Brown
told them that he had found them owing £l5OO
and left them with £2OOO balance on the right side ;
also that he had seen over £30,000 raised for
patriotic purposes during the war, and the member-
ship go up to 2200.

There were nine races at Rosehill (N.S.W)
011 ,® a^irc * a y. an£ i favorites (Linita, Collusion, Joseph
and Wolverine) won four of them. Two others
went to second favorites (Logic and Les Padding-
ton) : in the remaining three outsiders rolled home.
One of the roughies was Barosca, Prince Bardolph’s
five-year-old brother, who started at 15’s and paid
L 6 14s. 6d. for 10-3. on the machine. Hitherto a
very moderate performer over short distances,
Barosca was given a run in the 10-furlong Rosehill
Handicap and romped home lengths ahead of Wisby
and the Queenslander Lodi (backed down to 6 to 4),
with Cliffdale, Grey Arrow and Victrola among
the beaten division. Like the Prince used to do in
his exalted moments, the winner made all his own
running. And now' his connections are kicking
themselves for haying left him out of the Sydney
Cup. Another interesting winner was Furious.
Regardless of the probability that she was in pretty
good condition, the A.J.C. meeting being only
three weeks off, and of the fact that, apart from
the Epicure and Even Song, she had only third-
raters to beat, punters let the beautiful mare run
loose at 20’s. Without help from her apprentice
jockey, w’ho mislaid an iron in the run home, she
won at her leisure from the pair named in lmin
40isec. for the mile.
* * * *
First impressions of the weights for the
Doncaster and Sydney Cup are that the A.J.C. handi-
capper has been too hard on the three-year-olds. In
the mile handicap Soorak has 9st., Whittier Bst.
a ~ Caserta Bst. 81b., Cliffdale and Polytheist
Sst. lib., and Maid of the Mist Bst. 51b.; in the two-
nnler The Cypher and Rivoli are on the Bst. 71b.
mark, Caserta and Whittier have Bst. 61b., Kingslot
fhe Queensiander, Sst. 41b., Polytheist and Maid of
the Mist Bst., and Sir Anclrew 7st. 131 b., This page will
look elsew'liere for the winners. Since Furious won
the V.R.C. Derby and Oaks she has been handled
with poor judgment. If she hadn’t been started at
Rosehill on Saturday she would probably have got
into the Doncaster with Bst. 101 b. Even so she has
a decided chance with 9st. 21b. Others with good
Doncaster prospects are Sir Maitland (Bst. 91b.), Fleur-
lste (Bst.), All Gold (7st. 131 b.), Imputation (7st.
-lb.) and Beeline (7st. lib.). Hoses with Cup
chances are David (9st. 71b.), Prince Cox (Bst. 91b.),
Wirraway (Bst. 41b.), Mufti (Bst.), and Even Song
list. 81b.). The last-named ran a decent second in
the Hotham Handicap to King Ingoda, and finished
sixth in the Melbourne Cup, for which she hadn’t
done a preparation. She is a solid little mare, who
thrives on work, and if she gets plenty between now
and April 2, she will make the last half-mile inter-
esting for the others. At present All Gold and Even
Song looks a double to be respected.
« * * •
. The most impressive performers at Flem-
mgton on the last day of the Newmarket-and-Cup
meeting, which might easily be disposed of in three
days, the fourth being superfluous, were Harvest King,
til Gold and Easingwold. The King made an ex-
hibition of The Cypher and Tangalooma in the two-
mile King’s Plate, incidentally demonstrating that
Eccles’s colt is not in the w.f.a. class. All Gold,
with Johnstone aboard, defeated a field of fast
sprinters, including Maid of the Mist, Weedah, Lis-
navane, St. Speed, Sonora and All Serene, in the
Leonard Stakes, run up the straight six, and finished
so strongly as to suggest (1) that he was short of
a gallop in the Newmarket, and (2) that a mile
wouldn’t trouble him. And Easingwold, carrying 9st.
41b., led all the way in the mile Farewell Handicap,
among those behind him being Beeline, The Tyrant,
Blaekadder, and the well-backed Queenslander, Tolly
Scott. The Westralian exhibits his best form when
allowed to make his own running. He is ape to
shape ingloriously if the jockey has other views.
“O.Iv.”: The vanity of earthly hopes in
turf matters found further expression in the break-
down of Sister Olive a little time before the Aus-
tralian Cup came due. Fred Norman’s beautiful
mare had been earnestly intended to win the race
she was robbed of by Harvest King a year ago.
For a “place” she was as nearly a sure thing as
you can get at racing, provided she came fresh and
well to the barrier. With the exception of Prince
Cox all the likely ones had been cleared from
Sister Olive’s path, and on the Saturday before
the race she was given her final winding-up gallop—-
in a w.f.a. event. That was practically the end
of her racing career. Sister Olive went wrong
in the fetlock, and her racing days were ended.
The way for Prince Cox was then so clear that the
wonder was he didn’t start at even money, instead
of 2 to 1. The Shillinglee bubble had been
pricked, and Sinbad the Sailor was evidently gone
stale from: much recent racing. Stare, with no
form of late to recommend him, was giving Prince Cox
151bs. A stake of more than £2OOO was never
more easily won under handicap conditions. Seeing
that there is never a strong field for the Aus-
tralian Cup, run a month or so before the richer
Sydney Cup, the V.R.C. committee might now con-
sider the advisability of reducing the distance from
2{ miles to 12 or 13 furlongs.
“Fax” : If Easingwold is a most uncer-
tain horse, and The Cypher is unaccountable, and
Eurythmie has lost his old knock-out punch, what
shall be said of Salatis’s performance in the mile
event that: Maid of the Mist ran away with? After
Mr. Phil Russell’s pretty filly won the C. M. Lloyd
Stakes last Thursday on w.f.a. terms it was said
that Sunburst was lucky when the Maid got left
at the barrier in the Newmarket. Is there much
sense in these after-reckonings of sprint races,
where the get-away is all important? M. of the M.
would be likely to make a more or less bad start
in fifty sprints, whereas Sunburst would almost invari-
ably hop off the mark. A dozen horses, in an
ordinary way, are capable of winning the New-
market if they get the best of the start, but only
one or two of them are almost certain to get
away in front of the rest.
* * * *
“Whitehall”: Those who have hunted in
England will smile at the detailed cables of the
Prince’s successes in point-to-point races. His win
last week in the Brigade point-to-point, for example,
had about as much real significance as a “first
home” with the Brigade drag, which hunts about
Ascot all the winter. The Prince might have had
to put up some weight for the point-to-point, but,
on the other hand, he would have ridden one of the
best in his string. The truth is that the Prince,
though keen and thoroughly game, is no horseman,
whereas his brother, the Duke of York, of whom the
Empire never hears in this capacity, is literally one
of the best performers over fences, amateur or pro-
fessional, in the U.K. Apparently reasons of State
demand that the Duke’s sporting capabilities shall
be blanketed lest they overshadow those of his
more important relative.
* * * *
Like most of the Yankee pugs, George
Eagel carries a knock-out punch. Like most of the
present-day Australians, Harry Collins doesn’t. So,
other things being equal, Eagel sent Collins to sleep
in the 10th round of their mill at Svdney Stadium
on Saturday night. Eagel is a tall, muscular light-
weight, with an .awkward defence. He had shaped
rather poorly in his training, and the betting, when
hostilities commenced, was 4 to 1 on Collins, but
before long it was 4 to
1 against. Eagel was
on top all the way.
In the ninth he had
Collins very groggy,
mt could not drop
him. In the tenth, the
Newcastle lad was in
such a heloless condi-
tion that the stranger
twice appealed to the
referee to stop it, but
was ordered to fight on.
Then he unloosed a
punch that put Collins
to bye-bye for many
minutes.
EAGEL, the latest
U.S. lightweight.
He knocked Collins
out in 10 rounds.
“Timothy”: “Jim Roland” (B. l/3/’23) '■
who snatched the heavyweight crown from Colin
Bell’s bald head, is really James Roland Dwyer
An anaemic illustration of the grea> truth that the
white race wilts in the tropics, he has spent most
of his 20 years on the Atherton Tableland (N 6 )
and was farming, until a few months ago, on the
fringe of the big upland scrub at the back of Cairns.
His father —another monument to the ruinous effects
of the N.Q. climate—scales 16st. (Jim is three stone
lighter), and coaxes bullocks to haul big timber
round about Wongabel. Dad’s way of encouraging
his offspring 1 to win the belt was to remark indul-
gently that the bho.v would get the hide belted off
rum if he came back without it.
* * * .
“2nd Divvy”: In its las t issue the Sydney
Sunday Times published what the Yariks "call a
starry” about “a nifty and mysterious crook” who
lived for a month at an unnamed Bondi hoarding-
house with a woman he called his wife (though “in-
discreet telephone callers used to refer to her as
Miss So and So”), and took down the landlady and
the boarders on the false pretence that he was “a
polo-playing squatter from Blavnev.” The boarders
‘most of whom were men—and punters” believed in
him because (1) he rang up Sam Hordern and
talked about thoroughbreds, sheep and the Show ■
because (2) he “rang up Harry Marsden and booked
five pomes on a nag that was to smash all Kenso’s
records ; and because (3) he “rang up the New-
market stables and asked about his polo string
(“ ‘How’s the chestnut’s fetlock?’ he asked Ins
grooni. ‘Do you think the grey mare could stand four
(hukkas to-morrow?’”). The men who play polo
in Sydney may be numbered on the fingers of two
hands. Most of them are as well known by sight
to punters as Sam Hordern himself, and a more unex-
pected place to find one of them living, disguised
and under an alias, than a Bondi hash-house it would
be hard to imagine. Assuming the punting
boarders were not a collection of irreclaimable imbe-
ciles, it should surely have occurred to one of them,
in the distinctly suspicious circumstances, to ask
Marsden about his plunging client, or the equally
approachable Sam Hordern about his mysterious
friend. But the anonymous “crook” brought off his
smartest and most original coup in Usher’s Hotel,
where, having bumped against “a genuine squatter”
in the bar, he was immediately invited to have a
drink and drive in his victim’s car to Rosehill
races. “When they got half-way to Rosehill the
polo devotee excitedly remembered that he had left
his wallet and cheque-book in his room at Usher’s.
‘l’ll have to ring up and get my man to take care
of it,’ he decided. He got out of the car at the
next telephone and ‘rang’ the hotel.” So of course
the squatter lent him £2O. One wouldn’t object
to this vulgar bunkum so much were it not that
the “classy young gent.” is described as “an ex-
officer of the A.1.F.” The position is that he either
exists, and is well known to the police, as the article
alleges, in which case it is the duty of the police to
“vag” him, and of the Times to expose him by
name; or he is a myth, invented to cover up a lack
of real news, in which ease it is up to the Times
to apologise for presenting him as an ex-Digger.
The M.C.C. team’s return match against
Victoria resulted in a remarkable draw. Scores:
M.O.C. 71, on a good wicket (Liddicut 4 for 16),
and nil for 282 (Wilson 142, Hill-Wood 122) ; Vic-
toria, six for 617 (Love 192, Ransford 118 n. 0.,
Liddicut 102, Park 101, Ponsford 62), innings
declared closed. The finishing games of the tour
have a strong picnic flavor. They are decidedly
not serious contributions to cricket history.
Forty-eight country teams competed in the
cricket week arranged by the V.0.A., and Ballarat,
by defeating Kyabram in the final by three wickets,
won the competition for the second time. Dr.
Curtis, 40, 100, 102, 43 ; Arch Wilkinson, a school-
teacher, 102, and 117 (also 9 for 15, 4 for 43,
and 4 for 10), and bowlers Dr. Campbell and An-
derson were the stars of this even combination. Cas-
tlemaine, however, were the best batting side ; against
the strong Maryborough XI they scored the highest
total, 456. Their best were: Pritchard, 52, 56,
107 retired, and 267 not out; Seelenmeyer, 113,
112, 50 and 44; Freeman, 110 and 102 retired.
Of the bowlers Kohn and Vogues of Castleton
trundled practically unchanged on each of the five
days, and the highest innings registered
ag.inst them was 114. Whilbourne and D.
Thompson of Kyabram carried their team into
the final, taking 37 wickets at an average of 11.3,
and 26 at an average of 9.1 respectively. But P.
C. Bill Cannon, the old Fitzroy and inter-State player,
googled as well as anv of them, and he is 59.
“8.F.P.” (and this is the finish) : Mayne
(B. 22/2/’22) keeps his place in the Vic. XI because
he is the best captain the State has had for 20
years. Also, his average as an opening bats-
man in first-class Australian matches is 35,
and, small as his chances were, he was
fifth on the list of averages in England. Park,
who has been compared with him, batted five times
against Douglas’s team for a total of 15. Under
Mayne’s captaincy the Vic. team has lost one game
in two seasons. That will do me.
* * * *
“Tren”: Admittedly there was always a
difference of opinion about the bowling of Marsh,
the abo. express (B. l/3/’23), but his test of rock-
ing ’em ill with his arm in splints did not prove
that he never threw. Both Crockett and Curran no-
balled the black, and “Plum” Warner, who played
against him in Sydney, thought half his deliveries
undisguised throws. Years after in Melbourne I
questioned Marsh about his exclusion from big
cricket. He was quite frank about it. “They tol’
me I stole from ‘Mary Ann’ Noble,” he said; “but
I never did. He was a fool to leave his things there.”
“Venturino” : Add to “Matahari’s” list of
Digger-cricketers (B. l/8/’23) J. T. Murray, who
knocked up 152 for S.A. in the Giffen benefit match.
J.T. is a nephew of Chief Justice Murray, and
after counter-strafing the Hunt as a gunner, he toured
England and S’Afriea with the A.I.F. team. On
week-days he farms at Woodside, in the Adelaide
hills, and on Saturday afternoons plays for East
Torrens. Six-feet-two of Aussie muscle and sinew,
Murray is a great hitter. On one occasion he smote
75 in 25 minutes, on the Norwood oval.
Two friendly rivals in Bill Cutler
(N.S.AV.), and Clarrie Williams (Vic.), finished
with the same aggregate (331) in the King’s
prize at North Williamstown (Vic.) They did the
same thing at Sydney in 1921, when Clarrie won
the shoot-off; here Bill landed the £lOO purse
and the 15-guinea trophy, Clarrie annexing £4O
and a badge. The pair are such pals that when
Bill was being chaired, according- to custom, he
asked the crowd to elevate Clarrie also. McDon-
ald, a Westralian marksman, was third, with a total
of 330, and Dean, the Tasmanian, came fourth in
the King’s and first in the David Syme aggregate.
The Commonwealth match was won by N.S.W.
(1741), with South Australia (1719) second and
W.A. (1712) thhA
Racing on Sydney Harbor for the Rupert
Clarke Cup, Miss Brisbane indisputably proved her-
self the speediest Australian yacht in the 21ft.
restricted class. Leading at every stage of the
journey, she finished 3min. 15sec. ahead of Nettle,
the crack Sydney boat, with E.O.J. third, and the
six others out of it. Norman Wright handled the
Queensland flier with rare judgment.
At Manly (N.S.W.) last week “Boy”
Charlton won the mile championship—his third
State title —in 23min. 43 l-ssec. This is 6 l-ssec.
better than Beaurepaire’s Australian long-course
record, but it must be remembered that the kid turned
35 times as against “Bogey’s” 15. Also, the Vic-
torian did 23min. 30 4-ssec. at Honolulu. Moss
Christie, who was no match for Beaurepaire in
Melbourne or Adelaide, swam a close second to
Charlton, who beat him by 7yds. Which suggests
that, good as he is and better as he promises to
be, “Boy” is not yet capable of lowering the
veteran’s colors. At Brunswick (Vie.) on Saturday
Beaurepaire beat Harris (Honolulu) in a 300 metres
race, swum in 4min. 0 l-ssec. This is not Beaure-
paire’s best distance, but he is good over any journey,
and a world-beater beyond half a mile. During the
last decade the Yanks have sent us Kahanamoku,
Cunha, Ross, Langer, Kealoha and Harris, who are
unquestionably among the world’s best. And, barring
Kahanamoku, whom he never met, the 31-year-old
Victorian, using his improved trudgeon style, has
headed them all.

•‘l5-30”: Young
Schlesinger deserves
all credit for Ids
slashing defeat of
Patterson at Mel-
bourne last week,
but I think it must
be conceded that the
big fellow was; right
out of touch. Except
in the first set, when
his powerful service
was too much for
the youngster, he
was never the man
who had hammered
his way through the
best of the Europeans
at Wimbledon, and
had put up a stiff
light against Tilden
in the last Davis
Cup. Ordinarily he
should be able to rely on a good proportion
of service aces, but here he was putting- over
comparative lollies that the industrious Schlesinger,
whose greatest feature is his perfect length, was
able to bang down the side lines again and again.
Patterson, furthermore, clung doggedly to short drop
returns, instead of increasing the tempo by retaliat-
ing with Schlesinger’s own game. The muscular
Gerald’s girlish handling of the long, low sweeps to
his backhand corner was pathetic to witness. One fears
that Patterson failed in tactics, but there is just a
suspicion that his ground work was ruined by loss
of confidence in his new, steel-framed American
racquet. Compared with the shapely bit of willow
and gut, the American novelty is a crude-looking
thing, and one can’t imagine any champion winning a
match with it.
* ■* # *
Pat O’Hara Wood pleased all his admirers
last week by winning the singles and doubles (with
Patterson) in the M.C.C. autumn tennis tournament.
Probably if his fair partner, Mrs. Lister, had been
well enough to finish, he would have taken the first
prize for the mixed doubles in addition, because
they were having it all their own way when she fed
ill. Schlesinger, the colt who had beaten Wertheim
and Patterson in succession—a fine performance
which he should long remember —met very different
opposition in O’Hara Wood in the final. Wood’s
great library of’ strokes, his brilliancy in inter-
ception, and his ability to outfight the younger
man in baseline driving, if the match was narrowed
down to that desolate form of tennis, Were factors
that gave the international a strong lead in the firsl
two sets, and almost won him victory when he was
within a point of capturing the third session. Here-
abouts Schlesinger made a wonderful recovery, tore
the set out of Wood’s grip, captured the next at
9 —7 on the enemy’s errors, and looked like coming
with a great fun in the final. But Wood's superior
stamina and craft told in the fifth term, and the
youngster was left almost standing still. In the
doubles Wood had to carry the burden of the attack
and defence against Fitchett and Rainey.

When George Dempsey, the 17-year-old
Sydney track cyclist, plugged home first in the five-
mile amateur championship, after 13 of the 16
starters had fallen, the Brisbane crowd regarded it
as a fluke. That it wasn’t, the youngster showed
by winning the 10-miler from King (Q.) and Web-
ber (N.S.W.), in 25min. 33 2-ssec>, the race being
run in heavy rain. He also finished third in the
half-mile to Broadbent (Vic.) and Munro (Q.)., in
lmin. 14see. ; blit 880 yards is not his distance.
In Dempsey, Charlton, Beaurepaire, Carr, New-
man and Brancourt, the heavyweight boxer, not to
mention the tennis cracks, Australia has the material
for a first-class Olympic Games team. Before Kirk-
sey left for California he described Carr as a world’s
champion in the making. But “Slip” needs a man
like Arthur Postle, the Queenslander, to correct the
faults in his style, and keep him up to the collar in
the matter of training.
Rotten as the road is in places, on the
N. S. Wales side particularly, the journey from
Sydney to Melbourne, by motor-car or -cycle, will
soon be a dawn-to-dusk affair. Tommy Benstead
did it the other day on his solo in 14hr. 43min.,
beating the express by four hours. One of these
weekly record-breakers will presently play the star
part in a funeral. Then the popularity of the
pastime will slump.

Soccer football is going so strong in Ade-
laide that it was proposed at the annual meeting to
introduce the district system, which has done so
much for other pastimes. The opposition said it
would be “Australianising a good old British
game” ; on which an argument arose as to whether
the Lancashire League is governed by that system or
not. However, the motion was thrown out almost
unanimously. S.A. has promised to plav a match
in Sydney during the winter, and Tasmanians are to
visit Adelaide. And there is the Chinese Uni. team which
talks of visiting Australia, and a strong attempt is
to be made to induce an English side to come.
OVER THE ODDS.
[FOR THE BULLEITN. ]
An .elderly .bookmaker was kidnapped from his-
home in the hills at Olinda (Vic.) last week, driven
to an empty house in Melbourne and held to ran-
some for £5OO. He escaped through a window.
Money ed tourists as they travelled once ran risks
of being snavelled
By the brigand bands of Italy and Greece;
Sucking millionaires they collar in the country of
the dollar
lo be trailed to hiding-places by police.
On such picturesque abductions with the incidental
ructions
livery week or so the movie patron looks.
But a danger that’s appalling’ will envisage Ikey’s
calling
If they’re going to try the game upon the books.
h hen a roughie’s win discloses that some never-
laid-it Moses
Wears a bag that s chock-a-block with notes and
“jing,”
His content will lack fruition should be harbor a
suspicion
Of potential abductors round the ring.
One conjectures that a “skinner” generally means
a dinner
Where the fizz is iced and succulent the chooks—
lo be seized and gagged and shaken for a cut of
what they’ve taken
Mould be a poor finale for the books.
Various Government restrictions they account as
sore afflictions,
But this would be as scorpions to rods;
If, in rural home or city, he is shadowed )>v
banditti
The fielder well may tire of yelling odds.
M hat’s the use, he’ll ask, of laying and of fleecy
lambs a-flaying-
Yourself to be the prey of huskier crooks?
To be kidnapped in a hansom or a car—and held to
ransom—
Would spoil the day’s enjoyment for the books.

THE INKY WAY.
“D.H.W.”: Edith Erv’s volume of poems, hand-
printed by Phyllis Gardiner at ths Asphodel Press,
Hampstead (London), with a neat little waratah
upon the cover, is out, and copies will shorjy be
in Australia.
“McJ.”: I nominate the Thursday Island Daily
Pilot as the smallest newspaper in Australia. It
measures Ift. by 6in., is printed on one side only,
and has a margin of ljin. top and bottom and
Jin. left and right.
“Coot” : Robert Barr, Vic. Licenses Reduction Board
chairman, before invading State politics in 1902 was
editor and proprietor of the Fitzroy City Press. It
was in this paper that John McMahon’s reminiscences
of early colonial days appeared, and it was Barr's
printery that later turned them out in book-form.
“Kip’’: Any Australian free-lance who submits
MS. to the English magazines should keep in m.i.d
that two or three mags, are sometimes sheltered under
the same roof. For example, the Premier, the Red
and the London are all located at Fleetway House,
1 arrington-street. A story refused by one might
have a good chance of acceptance by another on
the same premises, but it won’t be submitted to any
editor except the one to whom it is addressed unless
the MS. is endorsed: “May be passed round the
office.” This precaution is mostly observed by regu-
lar contributors to the English magazines.
“Nimshi”: The author of a book entitled “How
to Write Fiction” is lavish in his praise of Mau-
passant, whose “Necklace” he includes as a model
short-story. This is not the first time the same
has been selected to show the high-water mark of
short-story writing. Why? The tale, although per-
haps technically perfect, leaves me cold. There
is no feeling about it. The main impression Mau-
passant yields is of a merciless dissection which,
though always skilfully performed, is undertaken
merely for the satisfaction of exhibiting the sub-
ject’s hidden defects.
“Wart”: Clive Lord, of the Hobart Museum,
and H. 11. Scott, of the Launceston Museum,
are collaborating on a handbook of Tasmanian
animals. It is to be illustrated, and the Mer-
cury office is to do the printing. Something
oE the kind was badly wanted, as Le Souef s book
dealing with the whole of Australia is about the
only book that can be procured nowadays. if
the job had been left a few more years the
Tasmanian tiger, and perhaps others, would have
been as extinct as the Tasmanian emu. there
are not many men to-day who know much about
Thvlaeine.
“Nibbler”: The Authors’ Society in Melbourne has
not been quite a dud ; it has succeeded through its
agent Symons in placing a number of local novels
with various dailies and weeklies. Its etfoits have
resulted in breaking down a ridiculous prejudice against
the Australian serial, particularly ridiculous since
none of the papers are stickers for high literary merit in
their stories. What they ask is a peculiar virtue
known as serial quality; that is, a sufficiency o
thrills to provide one at least for each issue, ana a
capacitv for being broken into small particles with-
out serious inconvenience to continuity. Australian
writers it is found, can fashion the sectional •story
satisfactorily, and the work is now passing into
local hands. The Sun Pictorial is the latest o
recognise indigenous talent in accepting a novel
bv J. M. Walsh and E. J. Blythe, the former runner-
up in the De Garis novel competition.
“J.H ” (London) : A section of the London press
has touched bottom over the Ilford murder. Ihe
worst offenders were the Sunday papers, the h\hN-
ing News (Rothermere) and Daily Sketch (Houl-
ton). When Edith Thompson and Bywaters exchanged
the dock of the Old Bailey for the condemned
cells it might have been thought that even the
gutter-press would leave them alone. Not so. the
brother of the murdered man was secured by
Lloyd’s to serve up details of Edith Thompson s
private life. The mother of Edith Thompson was
secured by another paper (for £100) to write
“exclusively” about her daughter’s home life. lne
father of Edith Thompson was retained by the
Weekly Dispatch to tell of her courtship with her
murdered spouse. Mrs. Bywaters, the mother of
Bywaters, was interviewed frequently by the Daily
Sketch about her interviews with her son in the
condemned cell. Perhaps it really doesn’t matter
much what a few newspapers do or don’t: but they
wouldn’t do this sort of thing if there wasn t a wide
demand for it, and that has a very serious
signification.
“S.T.S.”: Few authors are millionaires, but Irene
Osgood, j'ust dead, was one. Also she kept a pri-
vate secretary'. How I know it is this way. She
shared her American father’s wealth with three
husbands, divorcing No. 1 and No. 3. (The second
died before she had time.) No. 1 was a prince,
of sorts. Now, one of her earliest novels was
written round a thoroughly unpleasant subject. It
was not merely immoral, but inherently unwhole-
some, and I said so in reviewing it. A lew
months later my editor sent on to me a letter writ-
ten from Algiers, by direction of the Princess bo-
and-so, bv a private sec., claiming that the book
was all right if regarded from the proper angle,
and protesting warmly against “the Puritanical funa
of a Philistine reviewer.” The phrase was so
neat that one could overlook the abuse. And it
shows that some novelists, at any rate, do read
reviews of their books. Or was that what the
private sec. was for ?
“J.F.H.” (London) : Why don’t Australian authors
turn out more books of life and adventure in Aus-
tralia suitable for Christmas presents to youngsters
in the Old World? Just before Christmas there w
a large and highly remunerative market here for such
goods, and surorisingly few Australian writers seem
to be aware of it. Under the heading of Boys
Books of Adventure” a Times literary supplement
had a whole page lately about the stories in this
department, and it incidentally remarked:
“Australia, one would suppose, ought to supply plenty
of material for tales of adventure, but the only book
to hand dealing with that part of the world is
‘The Jackeroos,’ by Joseph H. Bowes, a lively tale
of the adventures of two boys on a cattle-run ana
of their struggle against a gang of cattle thieves.
Edward Sorensen’s collection of Australian nature
stories gets a good notice in the same issue, thoug
the reviewer thinks they would be more attractive
still as “straightforward descriptions, without an
fancy names or personification.” On the page
to “Books for Girls” Ethel Turner is handed some
confectionery for her “Jennifer J., ’ add in tne
Church Times, the High Anglican organ, she is
complimented as the Louise Alcott of Australia.
“Coot”: Henrv Heylyn Hayter’s volume of verse
entitled “Carboona” (not “Camboola ), mentioned
bv “Huffin Cuffin'’ (B. 15/2/’2B), is to be picked
up occasionally in Melbourne bookshops. My cop.
was published by McCarron, Bird and Co., m Wat.
“Carboona,” and much of it sad doggerel, w*
first published in the Victorian Review in 18»a.
It is the story of an aboriginal girl, whose loiei,
Wark Wark, having been killed in a tribal fight.
accepts William Buckley, the Wild White Man, a
his reincarnation, and ultimately marries him. Some
guide to the quality of Hayter’s muse may be found
in a patriotic song, written at the time of the
Russian scare in 1885. Here is a stanza taken
at random:—
“And if money be wanted let it be forthcoming.
No matter although the last shilling you spend.
Inexpedient the time is the cost to be summing.
Your homes at all risk you must safely defend.
“Mirza”: Scoffers who allege that the virile
verses anent horses, the bush and Back o Bourke
are hammered out on typewriters beneath dazzhrg
electric lights might ponder this vignette by Win
H Ogilvie, who claims to have tracked a few
Australian poets to their lairs:—
“Thev were hefty individuals with the girt oi
forcible languagethey could ride any ordinary
buckiumper; they played polo gloriously, swinging
their 3 half-broken ponies through the scrimmage
with light, hands and dauntless hearts, and at
ni e ht thev wrote their ringing verses by the light
of an evil-smelling lamp of fat, with their paper
covered with winged insects attracted by the light.
But apart from the Geebung enthusiasts, have any
of out versifiers excelled at polo :

Lady Forbes Robertson —preferring to be
still known as Gertrude Elliott, as in the
long-ago, when she was here as just a nice
girl, with Nat Goodwin and her sister,
Maxine —made her Australian opening at the
Royal in Adelaide, in a study of emotions,
"Woman to Woman,” by Michael Morton.
The gentle Deloryse is a famous dancer,
French, but living in London to have her
small boy brought up as an Englishman like
David, his father. David comes back from
a German prison knowing nothing of the
boy’s existence; and having known the
mother only as a peasant girl in war-time
France, he promptly decides to drop her,
and make his resolutely childless wife adopt
the boy. Emotional scene between him and
Deloryse ; another between husband and wife ;
another between the two > women. The wife
not unnaturally declines the boy; so David,
who apparently values him more than the
two women put together, elects, instead, for
a home with him and the mother. But by
this time the wife has been converted by
the previous arguments, and, after another
great scene between the two women, suc-
ceeds in forcing the adoption. Then the
deserted dancer, who has an unsound heart,
will dance and die; but a kindly doctor con-
vinces her that it is somehow her duty to
go on living for the sake of the child whom
she is never to see again. This bit is the
one thing in the play that rings false, and
confirms the general impression given by
the whole Wife v. Mistress contest that
Michael Morton went to a French original.
There is a pleasant but unnecessary epilogue
in which the mother, "many years after,”
makes happy acquaintance with her grown-
up son. It is a play of negatives. There are
few witty lines. There are no obvious ap-
peals, and the “gallery” element (found in
every part of an audience) looks in vain
for moral platitudes to crown with applause.
That is to say, it is Repertory work. Each
side of every argument is stated with per-
fect fairness, and neither party scores unduly
off the other. Each of the successive dia-
logues might be summarised thus: “You
might.” “I will not.” “You ought.” “Oh
well, I will.”
Gertrude Elliott comes back as a finished
actress. Her study of Deloryse, grave or
gay, is masterly, and, seldom off the scene
throughout, she dominates it. Cronin-Wil-
son as David is a more dubious quantity.
His military title must be Commander of
the Reserve Forces. Australia does uot
want him to over-act, but a man owes some-
thing to the primitive emotions when he runs
against them. Most of the week he has
seemed to be battling against a heavv cold.
Lillias Waldegrave is sound as the Society
patron who declines to be a matron; so is
Aubrey Mather as the doctor, and Phyllis
Moyle is a strikingly natural child. But
three people make the play.

The Sistine Choir soloists who found Aus-
tralia so much to their liking that they stayed
on after their beloved Monsignor Bella had
taken liis flock back to Italy have been fill-
ing Sydney Town Hall with melody, if
not with listeners, during the week. The
programmes are the essence of artistry, and
Sydney has been hearing many new and beau-
tiful compositions in addition to old favorites.
Paganelli is the pick of the tenors. The
voice is lark-like in its mirity and lightness.
The number from Bizet’s “Fishers of
Pearls,” sung by Paganelli and Rasponi,
was a sheer delight, and the “Cantique de
Noel” by Rasponi, with the other members
of the choir forming the chorus, was another
number that brought down the house; and
when the lights were turned out and Pag-
anelli, to the gentle stirring of Trudo’s harp,
raised his voice in the serenade from “Don
Pasqual,” romance found its fluttering way
beneath the breast-bone of most listeners.
The voices are good, and the method of
singing better; but the flapper in the audi-
ence is really most fascinated by the sliimmy-
shake with which each of the liquid-eyed
vocalists accompanies a truly feeling pas-
sage. A word of praise is due to Nellie
Black, who supplied the violin obligato to
the evergreen Gounod’s “Ave Maria.” The
season closes to-night, Thursday.
“The Flaw” is about to enter on its final
lap at Sydney Cri. On Saturday week the
emotionalism of Emilie Polini will make
way for the lighter dramatic fare of
“French Leave” and “Madame Butterfly.”
“Sally” is in her tenth week at Sydney
Majesty’s, and the advertising manager has
arrived at the adjective “stupendous” as
the mot juste. It’s difficult to find anything
fresh to say about “Sally,” but her flutter-
ing piquancy and winsome appeal are una-
bated.
“If Winter Comes,” the dramatisation of
the book that made a record in sales and put
A. M. Hutchinson on a pinnacle of eminence,
opens at Sydney Royal on Saturday night.
Playgoers will then be able to see in the
flesh “Puzzlehead” Sabre and unctuous old
“Jonah” Fortune and the exasperating, in-
compatible Mabel and High Jinks and Low
Jinks and all the other celebrities of the
printed page. All except one, that is; we
can’t find the Rev. Boom Bagshaw in the
cast. It seems a pity that Rev. Boom,
surely unique among his clerical kind, was
deemed unsuited for the stage.
Terpsichore, from Paris, continues to be
the headline at Sydney Tivoli. One of the
most impressive recent acts in vaudeville
runs her close for first place—the Gladiators,
who throw each other about with amaz.ng
skill and strength, and only break the spell
by some weak little prattle during breathing-
time. Frank Bradley and Alice Hamilton
cause bubbles of mirth with their subtle and
effective humor in a complicated sketch,
“After the Ball.” Bert Maddison, as the
Bookmaker and the Sergeant, catches the
usual laughs; and The Three Scamps have
brightened up considerably. The Fashion
Review still attracts the flappers, old and
young, with gorgeous gowns and Paris milli-
nery ; and Geaiks and Geaiks, the Cycling
Brunettes and juggler Zellini add good enter-
tainment to an enjoyable show.
A re-creation of “Tess of the Storm Coun-
try,” at Sydney Crystal Palace, with one of
the most elaborate prologues yet staged here,
is the cherry in this week’s movie cocktail.
Mary Pickford as Tess does her best —rather
a good best—to burst through the usual dark
clouds to the usual silver lining. At the
Strand and Haymarket Wallace Reid is seen
in an Americanised version of an old theme,
"The Ghost Breaker” ; the support at both
houses is lent by a splendid adaptation of
James Oliver Curwood’s “The Valley of
Silent Men.” Hoyt’s feature Frank Mayo
in “Wolf Law,” a mid-Victorian drama of
Western U.S.A., and Shirley Mason, who, in
her youth, was pawned by her eloping mother
in “Pawn Ticket 210.” The Lyceum and
Lyric share “Love Never Dies,” and a bur-
lesque, “The Three Must-get-theres.” “Man-
slaughter,” in its fifth week, is still warn-
ing the Globe’s patrons to stick to the
straight and narrow, and Oscar Wilde’s
“Woman of No Importance” looks like expos-
ing her inconsequence for a long time yet
“S ally," at Sydney

clowns and dexter-
ous divers disport-
ing themselves in

which has so sud-
denly displaced the
brown matting of the ring, it’s like an ice-
cream after a many-coursed dinner.
O. Asche’s “Chu Chin Chow,” at Mel-
bourne Majesty’s, compares more than favor-
ably with the Hugh Mclntosh version deliv-
ered a.t Melbourne Tivoli some months back ;
but coming soon after “Cairo,” which sated
the popular appetite for Oriental spectacle,
it is doubtful if its production just now
demonstrates the highest managerial wisdom.
Certainly Asche has done the thing in style,
but one grows t ; red of florid nnrades of misr-
niloquent savagery interrupted by twisting
girls. The eye has had too much of a good
thing, and in the re-action one almost yearns
for candles and simplicity, and the stately
sobrietv of the minuet. Still, many may be
drawn to the show by curiosity to see the
adipose star in his original impersonation
of Abu Hassan. Asche is a malignant mon-
ster, with a sardonic chuckle embellishing
his spasms of grim humor. The previous
potentate, Arthur Styan, diminishes consider-
ably in contrast. Asche sets a standard of
bland and pitiless cruelty, and naught in
menace is omitted from his convincing make-
up. Cecil Humphreys dodders and grunts
effectively as Ivasim Baba, and his head wife,
Alcolom, provides the plump and common-
place Cecil Bradlev with a minor nart in
the tangled Arabian Night. Young Herbert
Brown warbles tunefully to his Marjanah,
Kitty Reidy, who is not worried by any
Occidental restraint in responding to his
dreamy songs of passion. The abandon of
dancer Beryl Anderson in trying to persuade
the aged Kasim that she is a saucy escape
from gloom and despair is also noted with
approval. Charles Workman was a more
piquant and hilarious Ali Baba than Wens-
ley Russell’s boozer is; Gladys Mason, as
Zahrat-al-Kulub, talks in a hapless mono-
tone more suitable for the Chorus in a
Greek tragedy: as Zanin, the slave-buyer,
Beaumont Collins chaffers more shrewishly
than Maggie Moore did before her; and
Jessie Page, as Ali Baba’s sharp and astrin-
gent missus, is hardly a Rolls Royce type
among the shapely wenches around her —
more of a Ford with a stream-line body.
The perspective in Kassim’s Palace is a
remarkable effect, and an oasis in twilight,
before which Eardley Turner groans impres-
sively as a grief-stricken parent, is a bit of
desert landscape that should be cut out and
framed. Also the unexpected introduction
of a midget pantomime, wherein a Persian
Charlie Chaplin is a perverter of feminine
virtue, is a most entertaining trifle.

This week’s event at Melbourne Play-
house is “The Lion and the Mouse,” with
Nellie Bramley humbling the pride of John
Bunkum Ryder. Miss Bramley is not bad.
and is more picturesquely youthful than
Katherine Grey, who was the original Mouse
when Julius Supercilious was the Lion of
the show. Also the Australian colors her
work with a half-satirical giggle reminiscent
of Emelie Polini. But she insists on dress-
ing the part better than the affluent females
she encounters in the Ryder mansion. This
is merely asserting her position as leading
lady to the derision of the heroine’s social
position. Guy Hastings musters all his
energy and emphasis for the part of Ryder,
and is most satisfactory as the arrogant
financier greasing the channels of intrigue
with his slimy money. George Hewlett is
rough and ready as Jefferson Ryder, and
Ethel Bashford, as Kate Roberts, is a rather
dowdy little person. Austin Milroy reaches
the fruitiest heights of transpontine lugubri-
ousness as the broken-down Judge Ross-
more, but one doubts whether to weep in
sympathy with his sorrow or his acting.
Arthur Cornell bustles successfully into the
picture as ex-Judge Stott, and Victor Fitz-
herbert, as the Hon. Fitzroy Bagley, broaches
all his clandestine knowledge of the upper
masses. The creature is beautifully groomed,
by the way. His morning suit might have
been gummed to his elegant form, and con-
noisseurs will swear that the voice was
trained at Eton and Magdalen for the dip-
lomatic service.

“The O’Brien Girl” has passed her
hundredth performance at Melbourne Prin-
cess’s, and still there is no lessening in the
length of the queue. Mamie Watson, Maud
Beatty and the delectable chorus are not
wholly responsible for this portentous pub-
lic interest. Probably there are still a
few thousands in Melbourne who have not
yet heard the numerous ways in which Mark
Daly can be called to the telephone.
•1: * * *
At Melbourne King’s the dark and tower-
ing form of Ashton Jarry still looms up as
the bogus pirate’s mate who tries to relieve
Captain Lawrence Applejack of his bewitch-
ing Portuguese captive. Jarry doesn’t sug-
gest that he is having a hilarious time on
the Spanish Main. One might imagine from
his lack of lustiness and muscle that he has
been practising hunger-strikes down in the
hold.
* >:? * if
Howett-Worster continues to show a par-
tiality for the “Southern Maid” at the Mel-
bourne Royal, and the calm way he waggles
a revolver in the faces of Claude Flemming’s
cowering miscreants is another vivid illus-
tration of the axiom that one Englishman is
equal to half-a-dozen Dagoes any day. Every-
body is glad to see the doughty Briton pre-
vail. As he insists on beating the vendettists
in semi-naval uniform, his triumph is prac-
tically a national matter, and producer Asche
would do well to emphasise the incident
by making the hero wave the Union Jack
whilst the orchestra bursts into “God Save.”
The Royal Southern Singers continue to roll
their tongues in conspicuous Sambo melodies
at Melbourne Tivoli. Like other songsters of
the kind they pour all the fervor of an over-
wrought soul into sad, childish strains of
a semi-religious character. Oswald Remand
is also showing his pride in the education
he has bestowed on his pigeons. The birds
are passable in their way, but they haven’t
any personality for stage purposes, and
would only be really interesting in a pie.
The other performers on the bill are not
remarkable. The best of them are Gus
McNaughton and Jesse Sweet, who, however,
are failing nobly to get some bite into their
dialogue, “Professional Jealousy.” As a
matter of fact, the hard-working humorists
might as well try to distil a liqueur from a
glass of milk.
How Frank Mayo thrashes the town bully
and lifts a lovely mountain heroine is told
in “Afraid to Fight” at Hoyt’s in Melbourne
this week. Ghosts walking in a castle in
Spain are routed by Wallace Reid on the
same screen, which also reproduces the Alma
Rubens smile in a new thriller, “The Val-
ley of Silent Men.” The Majestic, which

On a dumb show in Melbourne: —
M. J. MaeNally’s latest show at Melbourne Fine
Art Society’s Gallery reveals that he has lost interest
in barren yellow afternoons. Instead, he pre-
sents 'several landscape impressions which seem most
charming when he gives full rein to his decorative
intentions. His “Old Trees, Buckland, Tasmania,”
is a delightful example of the type, affording a
perfect harmony in the massed greens of the foliage.
This is probably the best thing in the exhibition,
though there will be a strong liking for “The Chalk
Cliff,” illustrating a great curve of hillside sloping
down to a pool. In “The Hill Farm,” there is a
patch of grass that anyone would love to laze on,
though pictorially the picture suffers from the
unnecessary human interest in the shape of two or
three 'small figures on the top of a haystack. A
couple of boating trippers are likewise an affront
to the tranquillity of “The River Cam, Tasmania.”
“White Gums,” which gets the place of honor in
the catalogue, is a sweetish reminder of Hans
Heysen, but it cannot be regarded as a distinctive
MacNally. One has an inkling of the artist in an
earlier frame of mind in the big “Cloud Shadow,
which furnishes the odd illusion of the earth almost
flat and grovelling before the portentous mass of
cloud overhead. Other delicate efforts are “The
Orchard Valley, Croydon” and “Cottage at Egmont,’
and he tries hard to reproduce the admiration he
apparently feels for the headquarters of the Bagmen s
Association in Melbourne. It is not a bad study,
hut the building would need to be painted from
some uncommon angle or aspect to rival the other
subjects in artistic quality.
There is always a public in Adelaide for
high-class work, and, though business is big
at the Royal, Allan Wilkie is quite well
at the Prince of Wales. He has made a
change from comedy by putting up the now
seldom seen “Henry V.”
“T.W.”: Poet W. J. Turner —he is a son
of the man who used to run popular con-
certs in Melbourne Exhibition —has a kink
for words with a “pop” in them, to judge
by his play, “The Man Who Ate the Popo-
niack” (B. l/3/’23). It was Turner who
also made poetry out of Popocatapetl. A
while before the war he was over in Hun-
land trying to be an engineer, but itching
to get into journalism. Now he is one of
the inner ring of Georgian poets, the equally
exclusive London circle of musical and dra-
matic critics, does reviews for the Times
literary supplement, and goes in for play-
writing in his spare moments.

“Norbell”: Unheralded by the publicity
megaphone, Julius Knight arrived at Fre-
mantle last week. H’s first remark had all
the flavor of melodi-ama:—
My beloved Australia again! By Zeus, I am glad
to be back. The air gives me fresh life.
“I do not anticipate showing out here. I
am alone —no company with me,” says
Julius. But he of all mummers should
know that it is quite possible to secure
sound support locally. Anyhow, I hope he
will play something; he has done much good
work here, and was always a trier. But
he’s getting on. It’s over 30 years since he
came hei’e first with Laura Villiers. Some
of his efforts of those far-off days: Gilbert
Featherstone. the heavy in “Lost in Lon-
don”; Allen Rollitt in “Woodbari’ow Farm”;
John Christison in “The Dancing Girl”;
Loris Ipnnoff in “Fedora”; and Cassio to
Walter Bentley’s Othello.
“Stargazer”; In future when I hear the
furnishings and fui’bishings of a stage play
extensively extolled, I intend to go to the
movies. It has come to this, so far as I am
concerned, that I know a plav advertised
(as “Chu Chin Chow” is and “Cairo” was)
as a magnificent spectacle is going to be a
meretricious display of gaudy clothes,
eccentric scenery, spangles and bare legs,
and nothing of a play at all. To me the
play is the thing, and I hope there are a
good many like me who would rather hear a
fairly good drama blindfold than sit and wit-
ness a procession of gaudily-accoutred

camels and scantily-draped houi’is passing
through a thin and vapid entanglement of
words that mean nothing in particular. Even
Shakspeare cannot properly survive the
meretricious splendor in which _ Asche
swathes him. Too much color surfeits the
sight and atrophies other senses. Zangyvill
was right with his two boards and a passion,
and the boards need not be painted.
“Snell”: I metaphorically rubbed my ears
when I heard Henry Bracy talking in “The
O’Brien Girl” at Melb. Princess’s the other
night. The voice was absolutely the same,
and I thought for a moment Henry had
returned to the bright glimpses of the cal-
cium when I gazed upon the performer. It
was the supererogatory partner of the brow-
beaten husband I had mistaken for the
old favorite. The resemblance was not of
voice only. Henry’s quaint walk was
repeated, and the face and figure were
sufficiently alike to keep up the illusion.
It was with difficulty I recollected that
Henry had been dead so many years. Which
reminds me of an occasion when Bracy,
after losing his voice, was all broke up by
an interjection from the stalls. He had
received an encoi'e for a solo in “The Gon-
doliers,” and came forward smiling to
respond, when a voice from. the front stalls
inquired hai-shly: “Why give the blighter
another trial?”
“Nella”: It’s none of my affair and the
Firm is able to struggle along without my
invaluable advice, but why on earth did it
start Louis Bennison here in the “Johnny
Get Your Gun” foolishness when it had such
a sure winner for him in “The Great
Lover”? Had that admii-ably J aicted play
been served up first we might have swal-
lowed “Johnny” as dessert, and Bennison’s
seasons here would have been the striking
successes they emphatically weren’t. “Sally”
is making records at Sydney Majesty’s, which
is just as well, for it would be dangei'ous
to transfer the show to Melbourne, where
Hugh Ward’s “The O’Brien Girl” might
set even “Sally” thinking.
“G.”: What is the joke in suggesting that
“A Southern Maid”
is something akin
to grand opera in
its dramatic effects?
There are some sin-
fully bad grand
opei-as; but the
“Maid” is simply
bad without being
the least grand. Its
occasional pretenti-
ousness only empha-
sises its general
silliness. The story
and music are
obviously bogus
Spanish, which
would be readily
excused if there
was a bit of Cock-
ney humor in them.
But what could be
more boring than a
whole evening of
impossible situa-
tions —a bout as
di-amatic as a
speech by the new
Prime Minster —
old -fashioned,
humorless music,
as mushy as a
m.'d-Victoiian bal-
lad, and a cheap
rnagaz ne love-
story?
“The O'Brien Girl,”
at Melb. Princess’s.
Westley Pierce, the

“Rionzi”: “The Lion and the Mouse,”
repeated after a long s lenee at Melbourne
Playhouse, was once introduced to a certain
Maoriland town. Leslie Victor, the suave
and natty little gentleman who has been
responsible for a number of striking imper-
sonations, was cast as the Hon. Fitzioy
Bagley, who, though a bit of a johnny, is
hardly regarded as comic relief. It can be
imagined therefore that Victor was part cu-
larly dashed when his first entrance was
greeted with a gale of laughter. Mirth, no
less boisterous, pursued him until he made
his exit. It transpired that his stage name
was the same as that worn by the local sani-
tary man. and the idea of a Bagley being an
“Honorable” was considered too dreadfully
funny for words.
“Second Murderer”: It would be hard to
imagine any mummer playing Maestro
Cereale in “The Great Lover” more con-
vincingly than Gaston Mervale did. He is
unexceptionable in such parts. But it was
rather rough on a good actor to ask him to
sprint round to Her Majesty’s each evening,
as soon as he had done his bit at the Royal,
to play a totally different Dart as Mr. Far-
quhar in “Sally.” Surely there was some
resting mummer who would have been glad.
of the “Sally” part, and who would have
juggled with it creditably? Perhaps this
quick-change doubl ng is a question of
finance. If so, Mervale’s lucky he was not
required to make a night of ( it and finish up
at a picture show, where some of the Firm’s
artists are “lcndly„lent” occasionally.
“Dido”: Hxid “Ambi*ose Applejohn’s
Adventure” beep of Amer.can origin it would
have been less deft in character-drawir g
and more expertly worked out. “The Seven
Keys to Baldpafe” is somewhat similar in
idea, but “The Seven Keys” was a better
joke handled in a more workmanlike way.
There is not much in Ambrose and his adven-
ture when you eliminate the “Peter Pan”
element and consider the attentuation of
Poppy and Aunt Agatha. Apart from Law-
rence Grossmith himself it is acted with no
distinction, Ned Duggan’s Lush being the
next best effort, and we had considered Ned
only as a melodramatic uncle in the worst
plays ever. The pirate act is not nearly as
funny as it might be, for which both author
and actors are to blame. Walter Hackett
is deficient in the true spirit of mischief
and a vivid sense of fun, but he has made
a moderately good comedy that hasn’t much
innards, and which is as far from being “an
Arabian Night story” as can be reasonably
expected.
“Nota B.”: Joseph Levy Goodman, who
went aloft suddenly at Melbourne Alfred
Hospital the other day, was a brother of
“Goodie” Goodman, to whom J. C. Will am-
son left an annuity of £5OO. Born in Lon-
don, Joe was one of the first arrivals on the
Kimberley diamond field. He came to Aus-
tralia after the second S’African war, which
cost him a fortune. In Sydney he ran the
Lyceum Theatre for Spencer, the movie-
man, but Spencer sold his interests and for-
got to arrange for Joe to go along with the
goodwill. After that Joe rested for pain-
fully long periods, and financial worries
accelerated the end.
“E.”: That 0. P. Heggie has acquired the
nickname of “The Terrible Meek” (B.
l/8/’23) is due to the parts in which he
established his U.S. reputation. Bernard
Shaw chose him for Androcles; then he im-
personated the chief character in Chester-
ton’s “Magic” ; ana after that he was The
Little Man, a perfect example of “The Ter-
rible Meek,” in Galsworthy’s play of that
name. Whenever a similar part came along
Heggie was cast for it. Now that the man
is in a position to choose his own plays he
will probably do something more robust, for
he is an exceptionally fine actor. When
Australia swapped him for an imported star,
it got the worst of the deal.
“Splinter”: In my judgment Asche is a
better Antony (B. 8/3/’23) than Allan
Wilkie or lan Maclaren, the only others who
have essayed the part in Australia of recent
years. Maclaren fulfilled the physical speci-
fications, and one could well imagine him
warming the gladsome eye of Cleopatra, but
his unpicturesque monotone was as discon-
certing as Allan Wilkie’s rant. Wilkie
has no particular graces, and he w r as only
more agreeable to the eye than Asche s mp y
because Oscar has an overwhelming quantity
of adipose tissue. But put Asche beside
Wilkie or the other fellow, and the big man
gets first prize for the note of inveigling sar-
casm that makes the mob, for the first time,
a responsive entity worked up by a cunning
appeal to its passions. Wilkie tried to make
the most of a difficult voice in a situation
wherein he apparently couldn’t descend to the
tricks of the demagogic orator. He was
simply heavy and conventional, and he never
let you forget that he was spouting to a
squad of undecorative supers. The same
might be said of Maclaren, whose failure
called for less commiseration, however, be-
cause he hadn’t Wilkie’s vocal shortcomings.
“Lex”: “Nero” (B. 8/3/’23) says that
in my par. of the Ist inst. I overlooked the
fact that the man killed in “The Flaw” was
in the act of burgling Frank Harvey’s safe
when he was shot. Thus Harvey “could
plead justifiable homicide or death by mis-
adventure, claiming in the latter case that
he only fired to frighten the midnight
lobber.” In the first place such a plea
would be useless. The law (I am speaking
of law, as distinct from stage law) does not
allow a citizen to take not-shots at burglars,
as such, or to let off revolvers with the object
of frightening malefactors who are not offer-
ing or threatening actual violence. Lord
Chief Justice Coleridge la'd down the orin-
ciple in the case of a man who, while firing
at a mark, accidentally killed a child: —
If a person will, without taking proper precau-
tion, do an act which is in itself dangerous, even
though not an unlawful act in itself, and if in
the course of it he kills another person, he does
a criminal act which in law constitutes manslaughter.
In any event the essence of Harvey’s de-
fence was the medical evidence that he killed
his man while in a trance; that he was
temporarily deranged owing to worry. I
repeat that in the circumstances no judge or
jury would set him free to go into another
trance and engage in more homicide. The
jury would find he was of unsound mind
and the judge would commit him to a crimi-
nal lunatic asylum “during his Majesty’s
pleasure.”
“G.A.C.”: I don’t altogether agree with
“Ali Selim’s” opinion (B. l/3/’23) of “The
Land of Promise.” It is certainly not a
good play, but it has bright spots. It begins
well, and the first act ends with an effective
curtain. Where Maugham crashes is in the
Canadian stuff. I saw Florence Rockwell
and Frank Harvey play the thing in M.L.
had been doing the fearsome “House of
Glfils” and “The Land of Promise” seemed
almost good by comparison. It was well
acted, too, with Gertrude Boswell and
Arthur Styan admirable in small parts.
“J.F.H.” (London) renews his youth:—•
“Maritana” wears wonderfully well. It is more than
half-a-century since I saw and heard it first, but
at the Old Vie. the other night it had me cheering
with the crowded audience as if I were a youngster
again. How many Maritanas has Australia known?
Mrs. Guerin, mother of Docy, Maggie and Nell'.e
Stewart, was the earliestand a score of successors
might be enumerated, among them Sarah Flower,
“THE FLAW."
AT SYDNEY
CRITERION.
Maurice Dudley as Mason ,
Kenneth Brampton as Barney Steele.
Emilie Melville, Annis Montague, Lucy Escott, Alice
May, and, perhaps the best of them all, Madame
Simonsen. Sydney was, very appropriately, the place
where it had its first Australian hearing. It was
in Sydney that its composer, William Vincent Wal-
lace, lived and labored as a music-teacher in the
time of Governor Bourke. The thing wasn’t actu-
ally composed in Australia, but Wallace filled
several notebooks in Sydney with the musical ideas
and phrases that occurred to him, and on these
notebooks he drew when he was handed the libretto
in London. “Can you compose an opera?’’ asked
the then boss of Drury-lane Theatre. “Twenty of
them,’’ Wallace confidently replied. And so he
started his brilliant career. There is probably no
living Australian—not even The Bulletin’s Oldest
Inhabitant —who saw him in the flesh; but thousands
of present-day Sydneyites can recollect his sister,
Madame Wallace-Bushelle. Unlike her wandering
brother, she settled in Sydney, became its leading
soprano, warbled at Mass every Sunday in St.
Mary’s Cathedral, and survived to a ripe old age.
“Up Stage”: Gertrude Elliott was not
much of an actress until Forbes-Robertson
took her in hand. She was rather gauche in
those days, and owed her first appearance, I
should imagine, to the fact that she was the
sister of the beauteous Maxine, who visited
Australia with the Nat Goodwin co. Gertrude
became F.-R.’s leading woman after Mrs.
Pat Campbell quitted him to star on her own
account.
“Mid-Channel” in praise of Pinero: —
When in Sydney, Asche told me that he intended
to produce Pinero’s “Irij.” This play made Asche
in Lo. don, and he considers it the best of the
Pinero series. Brough produced “Iris” in 1902
at the Sydney Royal. In it Pinero satirises the
wealthy man who objects to his widow sharing his
wealth with a second husband. Much has been
.written recently about successful revivals of “Sweet
Lavender,” “The Second Mrs. Tanqueray” and “The
Gay Lord Quex,” but “Letty,” Pinero’s most bril-
liant work, is not mentioned. Yet the thing was
a rousing success both at the Duke of York in Lon-
don and at the Hudson in New York. H. B. Irving
did nothing better. The dialogue is superb. It is
co be hoped that Irene Vaimrugn will include the play
in her Australian repertory. Ethel Irving was to
have produced it here, but difficulties in easting
prevented its reaching the boards.
“Dido”: “The O'Brien Girl,” at Mel-
bourne Princess’s, derives much of its appeal
from an infusion of what I regard as a new
development in American humbr, a marked
fondness for epivi-ammatic sentences and
crisp remarks. The Literary Digest, in
its page called “Topics in Brief,” gives the
best examples of the thing I mean. For in-
stance : “If we lock up all the feeble-minded,
who will write our song hits?” These terse
items are printed daily (or nightly) on the
screen in New York, and audiences are en-
raptured with them. Melbourne picture-
shows tried the same thing for a while, but
only set their patrons wondering what it
was all about. Yet every jest of this type
worked into “The O’Brien Girl,” and it is
plentifully besprinkled with the Attic pep-
per, provokes a yell of laughter from the
same class of people. The marked difference
between the printed and the spoken word is
responsible.
By the lady who shows ’em in:—
There’s the old girl who wants a seat near the
exit —“It would be awful if a fire broke out,
wouldn’t it?” The sport selects a back—“l’m ’op-
pin’ it if it’s no good.” “Corned feet” takes the
centre —“I don’t want to be trodden to death.” Five-’
foot-nothing says (fiercely) : “Give me an aisle seat
so I can see something.” The baldhead: “Any-
where away from those electric fans.” And
the two flappers gush: “ These two ?.... er.... no, those
two? But aren’t these.... ? Don’t those.... ? These!
Oh!”
THE GOLDEN AGE.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
I sat in the stalls and watched the show,
A foolishly frivolous thing;
I saw them come and I watched them go,
And heard their efforts to sing;
I marvelled to think such a spiritless crew
Was really accepted as f.a.q.
1 thought of the plays we used to see,
And the mummers whose art enthrall’d,
Of the Attic wit, and the repartee
In the days when I wasn’t bald;
I yearned for the good old “Curse-you!” plays,
And the ginger and grip of the Bland Holt days.
I rambled off on a dreamy tour
To the stage I used to know,
With Nellie Stewart and Maggie Moore,
And the sirens of long ago;
Again I sat in the shilling pit,
In the wonderful days when I was It.
Just here a Goth in the seat next me
Emitted a loud “Ongcovel”
Then he gave me a jolt in the vertebra,
With a “Hey, old bloke, don’t snore!”
And he hissed in my ear as the rag came down,
“You’re missing the finest show in town!”

Have you
read this new
and very
much talked
of book?
MOW f (ID
Eleanor Gray
tells you
how
to always look
your best
WAS there ever a woman in the
world who couldn’t recall some-
time, somewhere, a sombre hour
spent alone in front of her mirror wishing
she were different.”
So begins this intimate interesting book
that cleverly deals with every woman’s
problem of making the very most of her
natural attractiveness.
A Practical Style Authority
Miss Gray is a practical style authority;
she has studied the problems of thousands
of women. She knows and understands the
different types and just how each type
should express personality and beauty in
clothes. Her new book “You” gives ad-
vice and suggestions how to attain that
lovely picture every real woman wants to
make of herself—and do it without in
any way increasing the money you now
spend for dress.
Miss Gray discusses the important subject
of proportions in her new book and shows
the necessity of wearing a corset especially
proportioned to your figure needs. She
advises a Gossard Corset because Gossards
are the only corsets designed unerringly
for different figure types. Their front-
lacing comfort, their light scientific bon-
ing, their graceful, natural lines are worth
more to the woman who really cares about
her health and appearance than can be
put into shillings and pence. And yet they
are among the most reasonably priced
articles of clothing to be had today. Do
you realize you can buy a genuine, trade-
marked Gossard Corset for as little cost
as the ordinary corset?
Gossard Brassieres
AndMissGray recommends your particular
attention to the new Gossard Longerlyne
Brassieres. They are differently designed
for those many women who need special
support at the diaphragm as well as added
length to their brassieres to prevent them
slipping up over the lower tops of the
modern corsets.
Go to the Best Store You Know
You can buy Gossard Corsets and Bras-
sieres at good stores everywhere. The
best store you know is sure to sell them
and render you a fitting service that will
assure you satisfaction.
Use the Coupon Below
While it is on your mind, send for your
copy of “You”. Use the coupon; and
remember that you can depend upon Miss
Gray’s personal advice to help you look
your best. If you have the slightest diffi-
culty in finding the exactly-right Gossard,
Miss Gray will be glad to see that you are
supplied with the model you should have.

all the world over, it is evry body’s land.
Humanity will know no hatred or grieve;
only this earth, in beauty, we shall give:
there is Work, pleasure, and life for us all;
Human kind together my thoughts would call.
. ...R.L.J.: Must go back... .F.8.P.: Some good
stuff in it, but a bit too rough.... Roma: First, you
must find out what a sonnet is,.. .8.E.P.: Picture-
show stuff. When did you hear Australians talk
'like that ?.... 8.M.5.: No use for your “50u1"....
Dunrobin: You can’t have rhymes like “harm” and
“balm” and leave all those loose lines kicking with
no rhyme at all; but there’s promise in it... .
Eleanor M.: Your verse moves on wooden legs to
nowhere. .. .G.T.C.: “He Returns” is no good- in that
shape. If you want to write verse you must take
the trouble to do it... .A.W.V.K.: The “Fluffy-
haired Female” is greatly improved, and should now
sell elsewhere.... Rustic : Very lame... .M.G.R.: Not
badly told, but not worth telling.... Flicker: The
“old tramp” rolls heavily in a smooth sea....
G.A.L.: Don’t believe a word of it. ...O’D.: Not for
us....Yanga: Suitable for a lady’s album... .G.P.
(Williamstown) : Too rugged. .. .M.W. (Perth):
Doesn’t resemble verse... . W.M.F.: Not strong
enough.... Cel: Not quite. .. .5.0.8.: Not well
enough done....J.S. (Unley) : Parodies are all bad;
some are poisonous.... Henry S.: Too slight and not
well handled... .H.W.8.: Well-intentioned informa-
tion about Australia, in verse which is dark and
terrible when it isn’t wild and fierce. .. .Pafa: Bet-
ter take a line of your own. Mere imitation of
another man’s work gets you nowhere.... C.E.C.:
Don’t know what it’s about. . . .H.F.K.: Too loose
and rambling. .. .Wombat: One line of the joyful
lament: “Kingadee giba-dee buk looey buk looey.”
Certainly, certainly !. . . .E.JjLT.E.: Hopeless while
your ear will let you rhyme “applause” with
“doors”... .11. T. (Brisbane): Poor stuff.... D.Y.8.:
Too much like too many roads around Sydney.
. ... J.J.H.: “Life” is almost a tragedy... . J. 5.8.:
People who don’t take the trouble to read through
their copy should be sentenced to six months on
pumice-stone and treacle and boiled in whitewash....
Betty: The yarn smothers itself... .F.E.T. : Follows
the obvious in the old ruts. .. .W.M.F.: Doesn’t strike
us hard enough... .P.It.D.: Nothing in it.... Alice
D. : Goes a very long way round to say very little.
. ...J.K.: No use for sapless, snapless rhyme....
Adrian F.: It moves like a wool team on the black-
soil plains... .K.R.M.Ii.: The pious wish in its placid
verse does not stir a pulse... . Carmen: Not up by
a long way....R.R. (Tonga): Almost every line of
“The Sinner” is out of tune... .R.W.R.: Don’t like
“Remorse”; and that long, loose line is no good
in easy blank verse... .W.M.8.: It is only quarter
good, and a thing as slight as that must be perfect.
A.J.N.: Not up.... A.J.L.: That’s a piece of
really remarkable philosophy:—-
Joy is grief but half defined,
While grief—is nought at all.
In other words, all is nothing and the remainder is
only three-quarters of that.... J.W. (North Sydney):
They don’t manage it. .. .W.H.C.: Not for u 5....
E. : Those fragments of the war that have nothing
but horror to recommend them would require to be
astonishingly well done to be worth while n0w....
John S.: No use. ...H.B. (Deniliquin) : Nearly, but
the metre gets very irritating in spots. .. .B. Upp.:
The verse doesn’t carry it brightly... .R.T.D.:
Feeble and commonplace; “Wellington Wind” is
only distorted prose. .. .MeJonah: Bumpy and
crude. .. .W.S.T.: A perfectly correct sonnet, but
without attractive lines or fresh thoughts. .. .1.A.F.:
They miss. The sketch gets nearest .. . .S.H.W.:
The rooster must find another perch.... Stude: The
yarn’s no g00d... .Paragot: “Caroline” gets on
pretty well, but can’t you improve her ending?....
Junos: Poor and thin... . Dugald B.: Bankrupt yarn
about a wretched circumstance... .C.G.D.: A weak
pun at the end doesn’t improve weak verse....
Eileen D.: Not enough in either; but you show
distinct promise... .W. A. G.: Not enough in it....
F. : The statement that a cat ate birds, rats,
snakes, rabbits and poison won’t make a yarn....
Bay W.: Not this time.... Bellerive: The “Poetic
Tribute to a Snail” has a rich, slithery movement
about it that few of the greater lyrics possess:—
Weary, dreary, ugly snail,
Creeping on your slimey trail;
Constructed with a hardened shell,
I n the mud and damp revel;
The butterfly is bright and gay,
The honey-bee hums on its way.
Poets have no time for thee,
But somehow you appeal to me,
Doleful, slowful, ugly snail,
Wending on thy slimey trail.
....Bushy: Begins poorly and gets worse....
Ralphus: “Swogger” misses the pub.... Quiver:
The bull is the usual monster.... Omoe: The “ron-
deau,” which isn’t one, won’t do; the other still
lias a chance. .. .L.P.F.: Fine in places, but a
little incomprehensible in others.... U. lialiptus:
Not enough marrow in its bones... .N.J.S.: The
theme has been better worked by many an aspiring
bard... .D.. 1.5.: Very poor. . . .B.A. (Woollahra) :
The drought-stricken gentleman who said “Thy
will be done” and then blew out his brains is too
sad for us... .J.J.M.: Only scores an outer
Dominie: Impossible yarn in that setting J.T.K.:
Very crude... . C.L.C.: Heavily-rolling commonplace
. ...R.A.8.: Horrible. .. .S.E.D.: What does it say
that has not been said the same way before?
TO ARTISTIC (AND INARTISTIC)
CORRESPONDENTS.
W.J.C.: Very crude, and not a smile in the lot.
. ...G.8.: Has not even the merit of originality....
L.L.W.: A silly little pun.... G.W.: Hopeless
scratching. .. .E.S.W.: “Choom” is the best of the
bunch and shows promise; but your figure-drawing
is shaky... .W.J.M.: Impossible in every respect....
T.H.: That’s better. ... H. 8.: Drawing all askew.
....Nemesis: But why is the man wearing fish at
the end of his arm?. . . .A.E.W.: Looks like a bad
copy of an English drawing.

EDISON
SOME LETTERS
FROM NEW EDISON OWNERS.
“Overhearing the New Edison, one
instinctively asks, ‘Who’s thatV But
overhearing a talking machine, you
ask, ‘What machine is that?’ ” — J.It-.
“Sometimes I put a Re-Creation on
my New Edison, and sit down to
read. But the music is so real and
so compelling, I cannot hut give my
complete attention to the music.”
—E.C.S.
“I have noticed that when people
listen to one of my New Edison Re-
Creations they are quiet and atten-
tive—they recognise the faithful
true-to-life tones of the living
artist.”—R.ll.

EDISON alone proves
Any talking-machine manufacturer can CLAIM
that his instrument reproduces the true art of
the singer.
But somehow Edison alone has PROVED his
claim—and he has proved it by the acid test
of direct comparison.
This test —dared by no other manufacturer—has now been
made over five thousand times before as many crowded
audiences of music lovers. Each time the result has been the
same—the tones of “The New Edison” so perfectly matched
those of the living artist that it was impossible to detect any
difference.
Why he satisfied with thin, strident
IMITATIONS of music when you
can have REAL music, rich with all
the emotions of the living artistt
Hear “The New Edison” for your-
self —the most discussed, the most
tested and most praised phonograph
in the world. Gall or write to-day.

"Topee”: Like “Sierra” (B. 22/2/’23) I
earned a daily pantile in early youth, but
never heard of the "graveyard watch” till
a couple of years ago. It was in Rabaul
an old recruiting skipper told me that the
middle watch (midnight to 4 a.m.) was so
called on account of more island craft having
been piled-up during that watch than in any
other. Seems feasible.
“Randolph Rentless”: It is not often that
such convincing evidence of a community’s
thirst lias been tendered to a Licensing
Court as that given when an application for
the transfer of a license from Parramatta
(N.S.W.) to Campsie was being considered.
The applicant’s lawyer put into the witness-
box a Burwood bottle-oh merchant who certi-
fied that he sent out 15 carts to collect the
dead marines. His estimate was that they
dredged 16,000 bottles a week from the small
suburb alone.
* * * *
“Barcoo”: The Northern Territory Aerial
Mail, plying between Charleville and Clon-
curry, loses no time on the way. Captain
Huxley, the pilot, took wing at Charleville
the other day with a couple of passengers at
1 p.m., and dropped into the aerodrome at
Longreach at 3.45 —270 air miles in 2j hours.
Passages are so much in demand that inter-
mediates cannot be carried. As soon as the
10-seater ’bus, which has arrived and is
being assembled in Melbourne, is put into
commission, prospects should improve for
air-travellers who wish to drop off at the
smaller landings.
* * * *
“F.A.”: “Platman” (B. 22/2/’23) struck
a happy date for his remarks anent tobacco-
growing in Australia. It is exactly 100
years ago to a month since Jonas Bradley,
a Parramatta settler, gave a lecture to the
Agriculture Society on the value of the
weed as a crop. Bradley, an ex-sailorman,
was very keen about it, and his remarks so
impressed Governor Brisbane that the latter
suggested a duty of 4s. a lb. on the imported
stuff, and this was imposed shortly after-
wards. But although Bradley smoked his
home-grown weed and gave parcels away to
advertise it, he was never able to compete
with the Yankee leaf, in spite of the fact
that his was adjudged by many to be in no
way inferior.
* * * »
“Catamain” : An agent for farming imple-
ments called on a N.S.W. North Coast
farmer who had not long previously been
badly stung by one of the tribe. As soon
as he introduced himself the farmer pointed
towards the road, and snapped, “See those
rails? If you’re not on the other side of
them inside five minutes I’ll let the dog
loose. The last time one of you damned
canvassers called on me he sold me a sepa-
rator, and it’s a blasted fraud.” The agent
pulled out his watch and said, “Yes; I can
do that distance in two minutes. That gives
me three minutes to point out to you a few
of the most outstanding advantages which
our unapproachable separators have over
anything else on the market.” He made a
sale.

“X2X”: The making of perfumes from
indigenous flowers should be an Australian
industry. Boronia, waratah and others con-
tain chemical bodies known as esters, com-
binations of a primary alcohol with an acid,
from which is extractable an excellent although
rather heavy perfume. Diluted with the
necessary proportion of spirit, a much lighter
and more lingering essence is obtainable, far
superior to nearly all of the synthetic per-
fumes. In addition, there are plants not
markedly scented from which commercial
perfumes could be extracted, just as bril-
liant dyes are frequently prepared from quite
colorless substances. Even some of the num-
erous varieties of eucalypts could be utilised,
with a very simple distilling apparatus.
* * * *
“Cartot” among the moonshiners :-
Between Rockhampton and Cairns illicit stills do
their best and briskest business. The raw material
is handy in the form of molasses from the sugar-
mills, and the rum (generally drunk white) is
amongst the best in the world, even if it seldom
is matured in wood. At a certain stage the molasses
contains its own ferment. Dilute the stuff, put it
in a kerosene-tin, and leave it in a warm place for
10 or 12 hours. It will then be ready for
the still, and, once through the worm, lo! a drink
that would have gladdened Job and might even
now dissipate the gloom of Dean Inge. As a rule
the apparatus is primitive; six or seven gallons
of rum a week may be turned out with nothing
more up-to-date than an old ship’s tank and a
kettle with a long spout, the condenser being a
few yards of piping in a cask placed in a small
creek.
* * * *
“T.S.”: South Aus. wine-growers are
hard hit by the recent steady slump in the
price of grapes. The Grenache, which
brought nearly £l7 two seasons ago, are
now down to £6 10s., and Doradilia have
fallen from. £l3 in 1917 to about £4 10s. to-
day. It is specially rough on the returned
soldiers, who were encouraged to plant
heavily—and mostly Doradillas —on the
strength of the old prices. A conference of
grapegrowers has just been held in Adelaide,
but co-operation is difficult. The few big
winemakers who buy the produce practically
decide the price. In the early days of South
Aus., families made their own wine; but
the marketing is the’ small man’s trouble
nowadays.
* * *
“S.T.S.”: The complaint (B. 15/2/’23)
about the under-statement of distances in
land-agents’ plans of subdivisions recalls a
mild protest this writer made long ago in
a similar case. I was. gazing at the attrac-
tive plan which, without going into exact
figures, picturesquely showed the allotments
(“Buy one for your child, and give him a
start!”) as bounded by the railway on one
side and the sea on the other. “Can we
interest you in this proposition?” said the
spider, coming out of his web. “No,”. I
replied; “I live out that way. I was only
thinking of the child growing up and going
to take possession, and finding out that the
rail and the beach are both the best part of
a mile away. It will give him a start,
won’t It?" ' - ' V"

Know the Joy of a Faithful Motor.
KEEP every part running true to
form. Be sure you have the right
lubricant.
Each moving part—every one of the
many bearings, the gears, cams, valves
and pistons—is but a single small unit.
Yet their condition will make or mar the
pleasure of driving.
When your motor’s working faithfully—
every part perfectly lubricated, your
mind is free for relaxation.
KNOCK or loss of power—and your
thoughts cannot get away from the
machine —the engine you should be un-
conscious of. '
Texaco Motor Oil is right for your motor
because it is based on definite knowledge
of lubrication requirements. When you
buy Texaco you buy honest and thorough
lubrication for every motor part under
every motor condition.

“Stellsby” : “Jesmond’s” par (B. 22/2/’23)
on diseased cows passing on T.B. to humans
sets me wondering how often the reverse pro-
cess may happen. I once resided close by a
sanatorium whence the patients were prone
to ramble over the countryside, spitting pro-
miscuously, without thought of using either
handkerchief or sputum-bottle. Small dairy
tarms abounded within a four-mile radius.

hobby of stargazing.
“Tedmulgar” : It isn’t exactly a Malapro-
pism, but its quality of polite evasiveness
may commend if. The secretary of our
Benevolent Society, reporting a case in
which assistance had been given, wrote the
following marginal note: “When we first
placed this man s name on our books we sup-
posed the woman he was living with to be
his wife, but she now turns out to be the
opposite.”
“Haka” : For getting off the mark with
his head I enter the bloke who sat next to
me at a political meeting at Oamaru (M.L.).
ihe candidate was criticising the railway
policy of the Massey Government which at
one period was losing at the rate of £3OOO
per day, and contended that owing to
Ministerial laissez-faire the railways were
being slowly strangled by the enterprise of
the motor-transport people. “What kind of
a system do you call that?” said the candi-
date. The beaten track,” chirped my bril-
liant neighbor.

H' Vv,- * about. the folly and wanton danger
ot this record-breaking business on high
roads. One of these days some infuriated
parent whose child has been slaughtered bv
a speed maniac will see red and shoot every
motorist or motor-cyclist he can get a bead
on. In a report made by one of the competi-
torB <l n a re ?ent trial between Melbourne
and Sydney, it is stated that at a certain
part of the journey, on the Victorian side
the speed was 90 miles per hour. One is
lelt to wonder how many narrow escapes
there were for people travelling the same
public road as this human projectile.
“Whitehall”: If you were the son of a
duke (I am speaking of quarter of a century
ago) and forged someone’s signature or
swindled a trusting Jew, you were handed
over by the family solicitor to Charles Gill
and he could usually get you off. Portly
and handsome, he paid tremendous attention
to his dress, and in Piccadilly on a fine day
more.suggested a successful racehorse-owner
“ an , a hard-working lawyer. He was about
the best raconteur in England, and for that
reason was immensely popular with Edward
VII., who put the seal on his friend’s social
tame by getting him elected to the Turf
Club. A cable now reports his death.

Rex Ham Pate as a Sandwich spread is great for
little fellers , old stagers , and every age in

Ships of Love.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
r I NHERE were chances to go courting
On the steamers long ago,
When they gaily went cavorting,
Leaving tracks as white as snow ;
When the tail-rods, lifting, dipping,
Seemed to like to pull and shove
On the good old-fashioned shipping,
That was close-allied to love.
(Oh, behind the dim, old funnels
Was a pleasant place to love!)
It was worth a whole king’s ransom,
Or whatever wealth you’d take,
To be on the shadowed transom,
Staring down the streaming wake,
With her heart-beats on your bosom
While the soft stars in her eyes
Made you fear that you might lose ’em
And they’d fade into the skies.
(Oh % the starlit, throbbing transom
Under solemn ocean skies!)
That was long ago, my brothers ;
Now the lighted liner knows
Neither blessed gloom that smothers
Nor the dim, dull lamp that glows.
White with light in every corner,
Through the fretted seas she thrills,
And the modest shadows scorn her
For the radiance that she spills.
(On the boat deck by the fiddley
Was the place for real thrills!)
There are spotlights on the hatches.
And along the main deck’s sweep
Are electric lamps in batches,
Keeping watch they shouldn’t keep.
If you seek the transom throbbing
You will find the sternlight there
Lighting up the bubbles, bobbing,
Where we used to sit and stare.
(In the silence on the transom
How we used to sit and stare!)
When we’ve settled petty quarrels,
Will we. find the time to think
Whether lights affect our morals,
Warning us from passion’s brink?
When the cynics cease from snorting
At such thoughts, I’d have you know
That a fellow could go courting
On the steamers long ago.
(By the funnels, on the spar-deck,
Oh, those eyes and lips aglow !)

JORROCKS was a man of might, big-

made of steel. The strongest man
in the countryside, there was no man who
cared to cross his path, not even Hartigan,
the fiercest fighter of the district, who, when
the drink was in him, was wont to look
on a rough-and-tumble as the finest pastime
of all.

on one occasion had explained himself to a
taunting group around him. “A man doesn’t
take on a mountain,” he said —“it might
fall on him. But,” looking around him and
baring his hairy arms, “if there’s any mole-
hill among you that’s looking for trouble,
say the word and I’m your man.”
With the right kind of strength goes
gentleness, but Jorrocks, coarse-grained to
the core, was rude where he dared, and, in
a physical, sense, there were few occasions
when he did not dare. His strength seemed
to lie always in assertion; it was always
the dominant characteristic in his dealings
with those about him. If it brought him un-
popularity, at least it won him respect.
“The respect of the damned for the Devil,”
Hartigan put it.
There were two people, however, who
viewed him with something more and some-
thing less than respect. One was Jenny
Bason, the slim, supple girl with the brown
eyes that were never known to look on
man or woman without a smile in them.
The other was Jim Darcy, an easy-going
tellow, whose, one desire in life was to hurt
no man, or, if a man had hurt coming to
him, to get between him and it and do what
he could to lighten the fall of it. That
had been his one desire when he bought into
Basoms homestead and became Jenny’s
lather s partner. A look into her eyes,
brown as bracken by the creekside, had
widened his world in a moment, filling it
with hitherto unsuspected light and color.
■Before he had passed his first hour in her
company he felt that something amazing had
happened to him, and that henceforth life,
always fine and inviting, was doubly worth
the living. YV hen, however, a night or two
atter his arrival at the homestead, he saw
Jorrocks towering above her on the veran-
dah, and she looking up in his face with a
augh of delight on her lips and in her eyes,
other feelings, feelings which lie did not
care to harbor, feelings alien to his nature,
came to him. It seemed to him then, sit-
ting there and watching Jorrocks and the
girl, that, after all, he might not be the
amiable, easy-going fellow that lie thought
himself. Maybe he, too, housed within liis
soul strange, distorting emotions, fierce
littlenesses, like other men whom he had
known and at whom he had laughed and
wondered.
Jorrocks owned the selection across the
c-ieek, his boundary fence being one with that
of Bason. Although the land was good,
well-grassed and well-watered, it could not
be said that he had made the most of it. lie
liked money, but not the effort that goes
«°mi ar ff S lts makingand, besides, Lason was
well off and when Bason died Bason’s wealth
would become Jenny’s. Most of his time
fie did not work, or worked as little as pos-
s‘ble; ,} Io F e to his taste than plough and
axe-handle he found pipe and beer-pot, and
an occasional hour with Jenny. Jennv
even for herself, was worth the having, but
Jenny with money was Jenny gilded
Mhen Jorrocks met Darcy he looked down
on him took Darcy s proffered hand, drew
himselfto his fullest height, and mumbled an
acknowledgment of the other’s greeting
‘‘You’re here to help Lason,” he said later.
“My father and he were friends,” Darcy
replied. “It was long ago agreed between
them that when my father died I should
become Mr. Lason’s partner.”
Jorrocks, looking over his folded arms, con-
tinued : “Are you just a raw colt at the
work, or have you been broken?”
Darcy smiled. “I can do my bit,” he
said. “I’ve been everything that 10 years
on a Queensland station can make a man
into.”
Jorrocks, still eyeing him, was silent for a
while, thinking. He did not like this quiet,
confident, easy-going young fellow. He
sensed danger somehow, somewhere.
“Been a horse-breaker?” he asked at
length.
Darcy nodded.
"Perhaps you can break Hell-for-Leather
then?”
“Perhaps,” said Darcy. “But who is
Hell-for-Leather ?”
“Perhaps—and perhaps not,” growled Jor-
rocks, rising and thrusting his face for-
ward, his lips bunching. “Hell-for-Leather
is just Hell-for-Leather, and the name fits
him like his skin.”
That night, in the men’s quarters, Darcy
talked to Hartigan, and Hartigan told him
oi the horse.
“He’s a sheer divil, but lie’s beauty itself,”
said Hartigan. “Never a man has crossed
leg on him and kept his seat. Sometimes it’s
the man that goes, and sometimes it’s the
saddle, and sometimes it’s man and saddle
both. He’s not an ordinary horse; lie’s got
the black drop in him. Man after man has
tried to tame him, but it was him tamed
them. There’s three men on the tracks now
that curse the day they ever met him. One
had his chest smashed in, one has a crooked
arm, and the third man limps. When he
throws rider he’s not content to throw
him. What he’s watching for is to get him
on the ground and savage him —to pound him
to a bloody pulp wid his heels.”
Hartigan paused and took the pipe from
his mouth, puffing energetically for a minute
or two in order to rekindle it.
“He’s cunning, too,” he continued pres-
ently—“wid the cunning of the Ould Boy
himself. He’ll let you come up to him and
stroke him, and make much of him. He’ll
invite you to saddle him and mount him, but
all the while, if you look into his eyes, you’ll
see the red devilish lights in them, and if
you know what murder means you’ll see it
there.”
Abruptly he broke off, an*d abruptly began
again.
“Who told you of him?”
“Mr. Jorrocks.”
“Did he want you to ride him?” said
Hartigan, taking his pipe from his mouth
and staring at Darcy.
Darcy nodded.
t “The divil he did!” growled Hartigan.
Well, then, for your soul’s sake and your
body’s sake, don’t. The same Jorrocks must
have something against you—you’ve crossed
his path somehow. And the same Jorrocks
daren’t go into the paddock with Hell-for-
Leather.”
Darcy was interested. He leant forward.
‘ Why is that, Hartigan?” he asked.
“Because ’twas Jorrocks made a brute of
h .im. He beat and starved him as a colt,
till all the hate that ever came into the heart
of a horse came into the heart of Hell-for-
Leather. And when he had made a wild
beast of him he got rid of him—sold him to
us because he was afraid of him.”
Darcy rose and stretched his arms.
Well, Hartigan,” he said, “a horse like
that is worth while. I must have a look
at him.”
Hartigan followed Darcy to the door.
“But don’t ride him. Look at him as long
as you like, but don’t put leg across him.
It’s harm Jorrocks meant you by them words
of his. But why?”
The last look that Darcy had of Hartigan
showed him standing in the doorway, the
light behind him, his fingers ranging through
his hair, as though to discover and clutch
an answer to the question he himself had
propounded.
Darcy saw the horse next day. Hartigan
had got him in the paddock and was groom-
ing him. He was all that a horse should be,
all that breeding stands for —strength and
grace and fire. In his eyes was the pride
of the Arab, and wildness of the untame-
able. His coat, beneath the brushes, shone
with the sheen of new satin, the morning
sun lighting up his chestnut hues. Darcy,
fascinated by the animal, approached him
and stroked his neck.
“Pie’s a beauty, Hartigan.”
“He is, but lie’s a killer, too.”'
But Darcy, looking the horse over, felt
that some day either he should master the
horse or the horse should master him.
One evening in the quiet of twilight, Darcy,
rounding the bend of a creek, came suddenly
upon Jorrocks and the girl. They were sit-
ting on a log, and before he could retreat he
saw that they had seen him. The girl
blushed as Darcy approached, but the man’s
face darkened.
Spyin’ around, Mr. Darcy?” he sneered.
Darcy flushed, but said nothing in reply.
The girl rose. “It’s time to be going,” she
said. “We’ll walk home with you, Mr.
Darcy.” She made as if to walk at Darcy’s
side, but Jorrocks, putting one hand on her
arm and one on Darcy’s shoulder, thrust them
apart and placed himself between them. It
was then, for the second time, that Darcy
felt something fierce, unaccountable issuing
from his soul and taking possession of him
something that called for all the powers of
his will to control and subdue.
As they left the creek-flat and climbed the
slope to the house Jenny said: “Mr. Darcy,
Mr. Jorrocks told me just now that you in-
tend to break-in Hell-for-Leather.”
Darcy, because of having Jorrocks between
them, could not see the girl. But so that
he might look into her face he fell back a
pace before he answered her.
“He asked me to do so. but I have not
decided one way or the other,” he said.
The girl’s face lit up. “I am glad,” she
cried out. “because he might hurt you ; lie
might kill you.”
Darcy thrilled. It \vas fine to have her
talking in this way to him. But not so the
other man.
“Afraid?” he sneered, looking sideways at
Darcy.

Do you enjoy life?
Your work, your
thoughts, social inter-
course, and the exercise of
your physical strength—
all these should be a joy
to you. Worry, sluggish-
ness, indifference, and de-
pression are all a question
of health—health’s every-
thing!
A sensation of delicious
freshness, a consciousness
of alert and sparkling
wits, happy outlook, high
spirits, sound sleep, hearty
appetite, renewed energy,
vigor and vitality—in
short, the abundant men-
tal and physical joy of
sheer good health is the
reward of those who take
a pinch of Kruschen Salts
in their breakfast cup of
tea every morning.
Tasteless in Tea
Put as much in each
breakfast cup as will
lie on a sixpence. It’s
the little daily dose
fs
Good Health for a Farthing a Day
The ingredients of Kruschen
Salts are necessary for healthy life.
Your body must, of necessity,
obtain these ingredients from some-
where, or you could not live. Nor-
mally, your system should extract
these vital salts from your food, but
as a matter of fact, owing to im-
paired digestion, overwork, anxiety,
worry and many other causes, your
system does not extract from food
the correct proportions of these
essential life-giving salts.
ECONOMY.—It is the little
daily dose that does it. A bottle of
Kruschen Salts lasts three months,
and costs a farthing a day. Get a
bottle at your chemist’s to*day, and
start to-morrow.
The dose of a sixpenceful of
Kruschen Salts taken every morn-
ing is found in practice just the
right amount for a most invigorating
health tonic. The medicinal dose
for persons suffering from pains of
Rheumatism and Gout, or habitual
constipation, with inactive liver, is
given on the label of the bottle,
viz., half to one teaspoonful in a
tumbler of hot water before break-
fast.
NOTE.—Kruschen Salts are made
in Manchester, England, by E.
Griffiths Hughes, Ltd., established
1 756, in the reign of George the
Second.
Australia.—Trade Supplies are stocked by H. & W.
Grear, 119-123 York Street, Sydney; also at Mel-
bourne, Brisbane, Adelaide and Perth.
New Zealand. —Trade Supplies stocked by Fairbairn,
Wright & Co., Auckland, Wellington, Christchurch
and Dunedin.
“Afraid of neither horse nor man,” said
Darcy, coolly.
In the spring, with Lason and another
horseman. Darcy went away to the moun-
tains mustering. The cattle, put out there at
the beginning of autumn, and fattened by the
lush green grasses, had become wild things
with the speed of deer, and it meant hot
hoof-work to keep up with them on the flats
and through the scrub. Yet it was the life
that Darcy liked best of all, because of its
thrill, its danger, its environment. It was
fine to race neck and neck with some head-
long-rushing steer, to gallop at breakneck
speed side by side with it down the talus
of a mountain, to head and wheel it and send
it galloping back, lowing hoarsely, to the
yards on the flat where the rest of the mob
stood mustered. It was fine, too, to lie
in the open at night with his overproof under
him and his blanket round him, and to look
up at the stars through the leaves and
branches of the tall, still mountain ash-
trees, and to dream. But it was not fine to
dream of Jenny, because she was not for
him but for Jorrocks. There was no sense
in dreaming of what could not be, but, if it
had been ordered otherwise, how he would
have thanked liis birth-stars for their kind-
ness ! Strangely enough, whenever he thought
of Jenny lie thought of Hell-for-Leather, too.
It was as though the gentle girl and the un-
manageable horse were in some way subtly
linked—opposites in association.
With a week’s mustering to bring home,
he left Lason and the other man to continue
the work of getting the stragglers down from
the hills and out of the gullies. He had a
good horse, experienced in stock-work, and
a C , o '!' lle « ood . d °g' s who knew what to do
and how to do it when necessity arose and
though the cattle, for the first flush of the
journey, rushed and wheeled and gave
trouble, in time they went along as docile
almost as a herd of milkers.
Now, he had forbidden himself to think
of Jenny, but as he rode along through the
bush with the dew still dripping from the
leaves and grasses, and all the birds singing;—
magpie, thrush and butcher-bird—he felt
that, with all this joy in being about him,
there must surely and somehow be hope for
him in the future. And the second morning
was like the first, and the third like the
second ; there was the same thrill in them,
and if at times lie woke from his dreams and
called himself a fool, he blamed the birds
their singing for making him such.
. Inwards noon of the third day his horse,
in crossing a creek, slipped and hurt a hind
leg Thereafter it limped painfully, and,
with all the love of a true horseman for his
horse, he liursed it along tenderly, glad that
a few miles more would see the cattle safely
yarded.
Later, as he rode towards the house, he
heard Hell-for-Leather whinnying to ’ his
mount. The rest of the horses, those not
m use, had been sent to an out-paddock, and
the chestnut was lonely for a mate. Against
the bronze of the young sapling leaves the
chestnut coat was scarcely distinguishable.
About the house, its verandah and garden,
there lay a sleepy sunlit silence, an absence
of life which impressed him strangely. He
knew that the men were away, Ilartigan
with the bullock-team and Horseley with
Lason in the ranges, but, notwithstanding
this, it did not seem to him that the place
should be so queerly quiet.
He went up the steps of the verandah, and
at the first fall of his foot on the flooring
Jenny came from her room. She came to-
wards him quickly, her hands out-thrust, hex-
face white, alarm in her eyes.
“Oh,” she said, “I am glad you have
come.
Darcy paused.
“What has happened?” he questioned.
Something dreadful.” She spoke in sub-
dued tones. “Something very dreadful. He
is lying in there on the bed unconscious.”
“Who?” asked Darcy.
“Mr. Jorrocks,” she answered, speaking
with a rush of words—“Hell-for-Leather
got him. He seemed to be waiting for him
the whole day. He came at Mr. Jorrocks
from the saplings where lie’s standing now.
He charged with his head up and teeth show-
ing, screaming as though he had gone mad.
Mr. Jorrocks ran when he saw him, and lie
screamed, too. I got my whip and hurried
to meet them, but, just as Mr. Jorrocks
reached the fence, the horse gripped his
shoulder with his teeth and threw him. Then
he struck him with his forefeet, screaming
horribly all the time. I beat him off as soon
as I could and brought Mr. Jorrocks to the
house, and there he went unconscious.” She
paused, her hands at the neckband of her
blouse, her fingers moving nervously.
“Let me see him!” said Darcy.
The injured man was lying on the bed
his big limbs sprawled out, his breath com-
ing stertorously. His eyes were half-opened,
but Darcy, looking into them, saw that
Jorrocks saw nothing.
“He’s hurt badly,” he said.
Jenny nodded.
He must have a doctor,” she commented
— (( you will go for one?”
“Yes.” And then remembrance came to
him. “But my horse is lame —he could not
go the distance.”
“Oh,” said Jenny—“and we have no
other.”
Darcy looked at the unconscious man, and
then at the girl, and again within him
strange emotions once more welled up and
thrilled him.
There is another,” lie said—“there’s
Hell-for-Leather.”
The girl started forward, her hand
stretched out to stay him. “You must not
oh, you must not,” she cried. “He’ll kill
you.”
“It’s life or death, whichever way it
goes, Darcy answered. And then, not know-
ing what he was saying; he added, “and
anyway, life is death without you, Jenny.” ’
He turned and left her then, and went
out to the fight of his life. It was a great
battle between a great horseman and a great
horse. But to the sorrow of the country-
side no man witnessed it. As for Jenny,
too fearful of what the event would be, she
crouched in a chair in her room, shutting her
eyes to all things around her. But, still, in from
the sleepy sunlight came the sounds of the
battle —the thud of hoofs, the fierce snorts
of a maddened horse, at times lengthening
out into a scream of rage, and above and
through them all Darcy’s voice, calm, deter-
mined, level. To Jenny it seemed that the
man was talking to the horse as he would
to a fractious child, commanding, compelling
him with his voice.
After what seemed an age she heard his
tones ringing out clearly, distinctly, tri-
umphantly.
No, Hell-for-Leather, you’ll go my way,
not yours, and I’m going to ride vou whip
and spur.”
Then the sounds of struggle began again,
and then there came to her the fierce, frantic
beat of a horse’s hoofs at a mad gallop.
Urey evening had fallen on the homestead
when she heard those hoofs again. At the
sound of them she ran to the door, and her
joy at the sight she saw was like strong
wine in her blood. Hell-for-Leather, Darcy
sitting him with ease, was coming up the
track like a racer, his chestnut coat flaked
with white.
, Ilarcy, reining him in by the verandah,
looked up at her, amazed at the gladness in
her eyes.
“The doctor’s following,” he said; “he’ll
be here within an hour.”
lie dismounted, and she came down the
steps of the verandah and stood at his side.
Oh, Jim,” she said, “you’re wonderful—
you mastered him!”
Darcy laughed. “It was all in the day’s
work; I’m used to horses.”
She ca-ine closer to him, she put her hand
°n- ( hi-s shoulder, she looked up into his eyes.
“But not to women, Jim —you don’t know
when you’ve mastered them.”
Darcy turned and faced her, his arms out-
tlirust.
“Do you mean, Jenny”
“Yes, Jim, for ever and ever.”
RODERIC QUINN.
The Seven Wax Candles.
[FOR THE BULLETIN. ]
QUINN’S father was a strong brute of
a man—a mining engineer—and
Quinn’s mother-that-was-to-be was a
soft piece of rounded youth when Quinn’s
father took on one of his South American
trips. It was to be a long job, and Quinn’s
father had an idea that a woman’s presence
might make things a hit more endurable for
himself. Quinn’s mother, who was only
Quinn’s mother in the making, would have
been happy enough amidst her wild sur-
roundings, for she was an adaptable creature,
but for the moths and the candles. Quinn’s
father insisted on dining by candlelight,
and afterwards sitting and smoking in the
soft glow. Of course the moths came in
legions, and Quinn’s mother in the making
confided to me it made her sick every time
one of the soft bodies flew into the heart
of the unguarded flame, and then fell with
a thud. Quinn’s father, being what he was,
loved to call up the horror in the wide-
apart blue eyes, and every, now and then
would call their gaze from the book or
sewing upon which they were unseeingly
glued, to the holocaust. Till on a certain
{light she ran screaming from the room:
I hey are smothering me!” And so she
screamed till the early hours of the morning,
when Quinn made an unexpected appear-
ance into this world just as his mother
decided to quit it.
The men on the mine attended to Quinn’s
father. “Accidentally killed” was the re-
port that reached the London office.
* « * *
Quinn felt weary and a little excited by
the rush of the previous hours. Well, he
thought whimsically, it was only natural
a man’s heart should race a little when its
owner was on his way to his wedding.
Marriage came once in a lifetime.
sometimes V Well, he hoped there would
be no second event for him —Mary was the
one girl in his life. He placed his head
more comfortably against the cushioned
depths of the car to think with greater
luxuriance of the sweetness and the truth
of her. He closed his eyes, and then the
old dream that all through his life had
followed moments of excitement took posses-
sion of him.
Seven wax candles in their seven giant
holders threw their alluring glow on' the
woodwork at the end of a low-ceilinged,
panelled room, guarding closely the secret
thing they surrounded. If he could traverse
the length of the room and peer through
the soft lambent glow, he would behold the
gift of life —the treasure beyond price!
Always iii this recurring dream it seemed
to Quinn, in the unexplainable but all-suf-
ficing manner of dreams, that he was a guest
bidden to a feast in the long, panelled room
at the foot of which glowed the seven wax
candles. Sometimes there was dancing, and
then Quinn would steer his partner—always
at these revellings the same graceful, masked
figure—in the direction of the waxen glow,
and always at a certain point the slim figure
slipped mockingly from his clasp and disap-
peared, or so it seemed to Quinn, right into
the heart of the candle flame.
The limousine purred its way through the
traffic, and Quinn dreamed on. To-day the
feast was more elaborate than usual, the
candles more blazing. He wondered where
Mary was—the bride should be at the feast.
Now, in some inexplicable way, the tables
vanished and they were all dancing. The
slim masked girl slipped into Quinn’s arms.
The seven wax candles sent up a clear flame,
and intoxicated Quinn with the desire to
learn the secret they guarded. The tempo
of the music changed, became faster, and
still faster. Quinn, a whirling madness oil
the waves of sound, swept closer, ever closer to
the seven tall candlesticks. A sudden turn
brought the end one within his arm’s reach.
With a shout of exultation he flung his arm
loose from his partner, and, raising the
gleaming taper high above his head, gazed
down on rough-hewn trestles upon which
rested a narrow coffin.
* * * *
The car came to a standstill outside a little
church. The driver flung open the door, but
ms passenger did not stir. The man shivered
through the length of his bodv, for even be-
fore his hand sought Quinn’s heart he knew
it had ceased to beat.

Kerosene Farm & General PuppDseTractnr
Saved a Farmer £7B
in 23 days l
TO save time when time counts and to cultivate a maximum area at
a minimum cost is the key to profitable land settlement on which
Australia’s future stability will largely depend.
The immense saving and great working capacity of the CASE Tractor is fully dealt with in an
unsolicited letter received from Mr. W. J. Campbell, Wongarbon, N.S.W. It is a whole story in
itself. Farmers should read every word of it.
HERE’S WHAT THIS FARMER SAYS:
(Copy.) Wongarbon, N.S.W., 14/11/22.
“In the interests of advance methods of wheat farming, I have pleasure in supplying you with the unsolicited particulars
of the work which I have lately accomplished with the 15/27 CASE Tractor.
“I worked the Tractor on top gear over all sorts of surface conditions, pulling the Sundercut and doing the hardest of
the ground and was never stuck for reserve power, I also hitched the Tractor to two 10 Sundercuts and ploughed for
three days on low gear. She handled this load with ease over undulating country, ploughing 4 inches deep. In the 23
days, the Tractor ploughed 380 acres at a cost of 1/8i per acre for fuel used, including three tins of benzine and three
tins of oil. I might mention that the Tractor gave no trouble at all, and furthermore, was a pleasure to handle. By doing
380 acres in 23 days, the Tractor displaced three (3) eight-horse teams, representing a saving in fuel versus chaff of
£5B, and about £2O in wages. ‘Undoubtedly the best thing on wheels.’ Wishing you every success, I am, yours sincerely,
(Sgd.) W. J. CAMPBELL.”
The CASE Tractor is doing the same for every progressive farmer who owns one, and the
question is—Can you afford to be without a CASE? Write us for further information about
the CASE and our terms of sale.
