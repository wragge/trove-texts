The Red Page
Jutland and Jellicoe
I am glad I have lived to read The Scandal
of Jutland, by Vice-Admiral Sir Reginald
Bacon (Hutchinson). The Navy has been
waiting for someone with - sufficient know-
ledge to entitle him to comment on the
scuffle in the North Sea, and with sufficient
courage to attack a popular idol. For such
has Beatty made himself ; the public, as usual,
merely followed the man who said “I am
it” loud enough.
Bacon wrote his book in answer to a
eulogy of Beatty, written by Mr. Filson
Young, in Lord Beaverbrook’s English
papers, as a result of an interview with Von
Scheer, who commanded the Germans a;
Jutland. Filson Young is a publicist anc
novelist, who was on Beatty’s staff as an
R.N.V.E. officer in the Lion. His previou
acquaintance with the sea was obtainec
crossing the English Channel, and on th
Cornish cliffs getting “local color” for th
“Sands of Pleasure.” He couldn’t have goi;
on Beatty’s staff without Beatty’s consent
so we may assume a fairly intimate connec
tion between the two.
Bacon indicts Beatty’s lack of experience
when given charge of the battle-cruisers, i.e.
only two months in an independent com
mand; and whatever other result the book
may produce we may hope that future Boards
of Admiralty will take to heart the lesson
that “hasten slowly” is the best maxim at
sea, and that, however brilliant an officer may
seem to be, peace-time experience in hand
ling a squadron is essential before an admira
is qualified for a squadron command in war
A brilliant captain may well be a bac
admiral, for during peace manoeuvres a cap
tain’s only job is to look after his own par
ticular ship, and lie has no time to follow
the course of the action as a whole, includ
ing, as intelligent study must, the “plotting’
of every other ship and squadron, friendly
and hostile, as reports, come to hand. An
admiral, on the other hand, has no respon-
sibility for the handling or safety of his
flagship; his job is to keep himself fully
informed of the movements' of. all other ships
and squadrons, so that the course of the
action can be followed minute by minute,
and the situation taken in from a glance al
(he “plot.” An admiral’s work is not an
enlargement of that of a captain, but is
totally different; and when Beatty, after two
months in command as an admiral, was given
the second highest naval command, his total
qualification must be assumed to have been
obtained in that two months.
“The Scandal of Jutland” is written in
the simplest language, calculated to make the
ordinary citizen rub his eyes and wonder
why he had always regarded naval affairs
as being so fraught with mystery. Step
by step the course of the action is traced
from the time the Southampton first reported
the Germans till well after the latter had
turned tail and run for it. Bacon has
evidently had access to* information, or, at
any rate, has obtained facilities not available
to the ordinary naval officer, much less the
public, and the result is a damning exposure
of the biggest bluff in naval history. The
popular picture of Beatty gamely fighting
the whole High Seas Fleet the while Jellicoe
comes down from the north to help him is
shattered by Bacon, who established that
the battle-cruisers were only in sight of the
enemy for 20 minutes, and that it Avas Jel-
licoe who re-made contact, after Beatty had
got lost. But this is not to say that at a
later stage Beatty’s appreciation of the situa-
tion may not have been more correct than
Jellicoe’s.
Which leads up to what the Navy really
considers to be the worst feature of the
anti-Jellicoe campaign. We may pass over
Beatty’s alleged inexperience at sea as
not being his fault • we may pass over the
Dogger Bank action, where Moore was
blamed, many say, for Beatty’s mistakes:
we may overlook the notoriously bad gun-
nery of the battle-cruisers g we may overlook
all technical, tactical or strategical errors,
actual or alleged, made by Beatty. But we
cannot blind ourselves to the fact that, if
the situation at Jutland was as Bacon says,
Beatty there and then laid the foundations
of the press campaign which followed by
making the signal on which the whole sub-
sequent publicity campaign hinged. Bacon
describes Beatty as having been absolutely
lost‘at Jutland; if this is so, and the facts
seem indisputable, why did Beatty try to
assume control of the action by saying to
Jellicoe: “If the battle fleet will now follow
me we can cut off the whole High Seas Fleet”?
If the battle fleet had followed Beatty, and
a smashing victory had resulted, Beatty
would have got the credit, and any previous
mistakes would have been deemed insigni-
ficant. If the battle fleet did not follow
Beatty, which it didn’t, the world could be
told that Jellicoe lost a smashing victory
by not doing so. And the world has been
told so sedulously ever since. Beatty’s signal
made things safe for Beatty—till Bacon
came along, goaded by Filson Young. Beattys
friend. Jellicoe refused to risk the battle
fleet to save Beatty’s reputation, and Beatty,
sore in consequence, took the first step in
his publicity campaign when he made his
famous signal.
We cannot doubt that this signal was care-
fully thought out, because during the Paris
peace celebrations Beatty said he would not
have hesitated to risk the battle fleet, know-
ing the French Fleet would still have been
intact to oppose the Germans. That was
the second step in the publicity campaign,
and _ there were many more. When the
Armistice was signed crowds gathered
in front of the Admiralty, and cheers
were called for every naval com-
mander of note except Jellicoe—Beatty had
eclipsed him. But Filson Young has wrecked
Beatty; he has gone too far, probably with-
out Beatty’s consent, not so much by writ-
ing his articles as by starting proceedings
against Bacon. Beatty probably doesn’t
mind Bacon’s book much, but what he could
not stand would be an investigation of the
Battle of Jutland before a judge and jury.
Young said Bacon had destroyed the re-
publication value of his articles. Bacon’s
obvious defence would be that the articles
never had any value to start with, and, to
prove that. Bacon would have had to traverse
the whole action; Beatty would have had to
go into the witness-box, as also would Jel-
licoe, and the facts deduced in Bacon’s book
and supported in the witness-box would have
been too much for Beatty. So, in order not
to oblige “highly-placed officials” to appear
in court. Young withdrew his action.
One further vindication of Jellicoe I do
not see. mentioned in Bacon’s book. It was
known immediately Jellicoe and Beatty made
contact at Jutland that one of the two was
about 15 miles out in his reckoning, but
it was not known which. Not long ago the
wreck of the Invincible was located and the
position “fixed.” The result shows that
Beatty was miles out in his calculations
and Jellicoe only a matter.of yards. Yet
it was Beatty who proposed to lead Jellicoe!
The Navy will rejoice over “The Scandal
of Jutland,” but it will not be fully content
till Parliament has voted “J.J.” at least the
same cash reward as Beatty, and until the
King has raised him a step above Beatty in
the peerage of the British Empire. Then
will the R.N. be satisfied that efficiency and
merit count for more than self-advertisement.

Mankind at the Crossroads
In Mankind at the Crossroads (Scribner)
Edward M. East has done his generation a
service. Without pretending to teach us
any new truths, he has connected and com-
pacted the best of modern thought on Mal-
thusianism, on Eugenics, on the “rising tide
of color,” on the inefficiency of most politi-
cal nostrums, and has summed it all up in
one sentence to the effect that in birth con-
trol lies the real hope of the future for the
regeneration of mankind. “Genetics,” he
says, “has enticed a great many explorers
during the past two decades. They have
labored with fruit-flies and guinea-pigs, with
sweet-peas and corn, and have made heredity
no longer a mystery but an exact science to
be ranked behind physics and chemistry.”
But when it came to a question of the
human species, its possible betterment and
ultimate perfectibility, the investigator found
his hand stayed by a mysterious taboo. Of
late that taboo has been lifted, and the con-
viction is gradually growing that the correc-
tive for many of our troubles is to be found
in the .control of human reproduction. The
doctrine of Thomas Malthus, that poverty,
disease and premature death can only be
eliminated by a limitation of offspring, has
slowly but surely come into its own-—as the
truth must do.
East declines point blank to accept the
theory of a school, headed by Lotlirop Stod-
dard, to the effect that the colored races are
increasing much more rapidly than the white,
and must therefore supplant them. The
facts are quite the other way. The negro
population of the United States, including
all who had descernible black blood, was
about 10.5 millions in 1920. In the pre-
ceding decade it increased only 6.5 per cent.,
according to census. Between 1900 and
1910 the increase was 11.2 per cent., and in
every previous decade for the last century
was still higher, reaching a maximum of
37.5 per cent, for the first decade of the
nineteenth century. The white race shows
a similar tendency; but whereas the white
increase falls from 36 p,c. to 16 p.c. per
decade in that period, the black rate falls
from 37 1 p.c. to p.c. “Only in the
South,” says this writer, “is the negro in-
creasing, and even there the rate of increase
is becoming slower every year. Between
1910 and 1920 the number of white children
under five years of age increased by over a
million, while the number of negro children
of the same age interval' decreased by nearly
120,000. And although at every census
between 1850 and 1910 the number of negro
children to every 1000 negro women of child-
bearing age had exceeded the ratio for white
women by from 40 to 170 per 1000 women,
in 1920 the ratio of children to white wpmen
exceeded that of children to negro women
by 42 per 1000.” This is a startling revela-
lation. The real color problem of America
lies in the mulatto and his descendants. Dr.
FI. E. Jordan, of Virginia University, found,
after years of study, that the mulatto had a
greater net fertility owing to his ability to
care for children. With white blood comes
greater intelligence and a lower death-rate.
In another 30 years the mulatto will
probably be numerically supm-ior to the pure
black.
Commenting again on Stoddard's state-
ment that “whites tend to double in 80
years, yellows and browns in 60 years,
blacks in 40 years,” on which figures that
writer built up his theory. East qu’otes the
census officials of the United States, who
believe that population in China is practi-
cally stationary, while the rate of increase
for the yellow race generally cannot be over
1.5 per 1000 annually. East’s own calcu-
lation. based on ICnibbs’s figures largely, is
that the main body of the white race tends
to double in 58 years. While their Asiatic
relatives tend to double in 87 years.
For much of modern charity and “benevo-
lence” East has no time. Public money is
spent largely on the indolent, the pauper and
the criminal. There are almshouses by the
score. There are schools for the feeble-
minded and backward. Still one wonders
why a whole-souled benevolence must include
the encouragement of recipients to produce
increasing battalions of their own kind to
weigh down the burden of the next genera-
tion. Why are the rotten timbers of society
repaired and. painted while the more solid
framework is abandoned to wind and
weather? Why is the producer repressed
and his fertility restrained to make room for
the parasite? “One of our social workers
is quoted as saying that everv child is worth
5000 dollars to society. Stuff and nonsense!
Some of them are not worth 5000 Soviet
roubles—they are liabilities, not assets:
others are worth golden millions. If we are
to prosper the assets must be increased and
the liabilities reduced.”
In the period 1870-1915 all the countries
of Europe show a decreasing birth-rate.' In
England it has fallen 12 per 1000; in France

7 per 1000; in Ireland nearly 5 per 1000;
in Russia 5 per 1000. This is mainly due
to the fact that children are no longer
economic assets. So long as children cost
little to raise till they were six or seven years
old and could then be put to work, families
were large. "When child-labor law’s came
into being the families became smaller.
“Large families,” says Karl Pearson, are
only possible where there is no progress or
expectation of progress.” The attitude of
Australia, S’Africa and California is summed
up in this style:—
They wish to avoid the crushing competition of
peoples accustomed to toiling 16 hours a day. They
say: “Why should we ruin our own and our children’s
prospects' of comfort by receiving this overflow,
carelessly spawned on the world by unthinking in-
competents who should know the crowded condi-
tions into which their children are born? Let their
own Governments take the matter in hand.” The
answer may be crude but it is straight to the
point.
People who worry about the supposed de-
cline in the numbers of the white race of
late years may find comfort in the fact that
in England and Wales, taken as a whole,
there were over 20 babies for every 10 deaths
in the year 1920. as against 14 babies per 10
deaths in 1838-39. The birth-rate is falling,
but the death-rate is falling faster.
The doctrine of Marx that capitalism is
the root of the world’s misery, East charac-
terises as a curse to mankind. Mrs. Sanger
is quoted thereupon :
It is a flattenin'' doctrine, since it teaches the
laborer that all the fault is with somebody else,
that he is the victim of circumstances and not even
a partner in the creation of his own and his children’s
misery.
The workers are taught to believe that the
greater the number of mouths, and the
emptier the stomachs, the more quickly will
the “Class War” be precipitated—the
greater the increase in the proletariat, the
greater the incentive to revolution. This
may not be “sound Marx,” but it is the
popular acceptation. All Socialistic schemes
must depend for their success on minimising
the selfish instincts of mankind. But the
instinct for self-advancement is too
primordial for elimination; that is why
these beautiful theories always fail. Any
redistribution of wealth to-day would be
immediately followed by a fresh increase in
population neutralising the alleged benefit,
so that we are driven to admit that any real
betterment of the race can only be attained
by restrictions placed on the reproductive
instinct. And as the economic level of the
race can only be bettered by an improve-
ment in the ability of its members, we are
compelled to see at last that there is only
one method left us. That is the use of the
stockman’s method —good and restricted
breeding. There is no question of the reck-
less fertility of the unfit. The true eugenic
task is to depress the birth-rate of the social
weaklings wherever found. Unfortunately
the cheeking goes on in quite the opposite
direction.
P. AIREY.
A Movie of the Birth of Man
During the afternoon we heard the notes
of a gamelang coming from the depths of
a neat, green-painted pendopo at the back
of the Government rest-house. Heer Wiel-
andt, our “boy” told us, was holding a
v-ayang Iclitek in honor of the tobacco spirit,
who had dealt generously with him this
season.
It was dark inside Heer Wielandt’s pen-
dopo. Outside the rain fell straight down,
like a gigantic shower-bath. The Dieng
Plateau was doing its best to live up to its
reputation of being the wettest spot in Java,
with an annual fall of 315 inches. In the
large front room, before a white curtain, was
a squatting orchestra, and the instruments
of a full gamelang glittering with gold and
red paint and polished brass. On each side,
ranged in the wings, were 30 or 40 of the
little puppets of the Javanese shadow-show.
In the middle squatted the d<ilang within
easy reach of his gods, heroes, lovely peris
and ravening demons. In a high voice he
was intoning the immemorial epic of the
giant-wars, bending sideways suddenly to
bring into action pink-faced Aswattama,
or Dursasana, red-visaged and terrific.
Wrapped in blankets —for it was cold at
7000 feet even on this equatorial island —
or huddled in figured sarongs, the tobacco
workers crouched, following with silent
wonder a story that must have been familiar
to them since their babyhood. The scene re-
called that passage in the Kawi epic, Ard-
juno’s Nuptials, when the pageant of the
seven widadaris sent to test Ardjuno’s war-
time asceticism so inflamed the amorous hearts
of the other Celestials that they had not
eyes enough to take in all the beauty of the
show, so that a mysterious third eye mani-
fested itself in the middle of their foreheads.
A half-caste who spoke Malay and a little
Dutch took us behind the screen, which is
the proper place to view the> shadow-play.
There his black-eyed wife and a half-dozen
toothless ladies were bent over a mat play-
ing some game of chance while the strange
nightmare projections of the vutn/ang rushed
to and fro in battle or hugged in courtship
above their heads. One of the old dames
removed the quid of betel-nut from her crim-
son mouth and parked it on the crosspiece
of our chair while she interpreted the play
for us and described the characters and attri-
butes of the weird shadows an the screen.
That figure with the round, lascivious eye
and the sensual, squat legs, the hirsute neck
and the beard growing out of tie nose, was
the demon-king, Niwata Kawacha. That
other fearsome spectre with the hysterical
hair and the visible gums was savage Buris-
rawas, a rahshasa of the Bairawa sect, who
drink themselves into a state of madness in
which they eat corpses and unimaginable
filth, and practise incest as a religious exer-
cise. There, too, was Banowati, whom the
ancient poet describes as so lovely that
Dipankara, the amorous Bun-god, is loath
to sink beneath the waves when she is walk-
ing in her garden; she resembles as much
as anything an anopheles mosquito. And
there, like a gaily-painted stick-insect, was
the hero Ardjuno, who defeats the demon-
king, and in reward is led by Indra to a
gorgeous bridal bed on which the seven lovely
widadaris await him.
For, strange as it may seem, these phan-
tasmagoria of evil dreams, with their snake-
like lips, wasp-like waists and spidery limbs,
are credited with human appetites and pas-
sions. They live as authentically in the
Javanese soul as Cleopatra or lago in the
European, and centuries of persecution by
the Mohammedan priests has failed to oust
them. Interpreted by some as a cosmic
epic depicting the struggle between the
forces of good and evil, and by others as the
contest between the dry and wet monsoons,
between drought and plenty, the story, de-
spite its Hindu trappings, dates back to no
one knows what dim period in the history of
the ract. It was actually on the evidence
of these ancient epics that Dubois and Prof.
Deecke claimed that they found a great
number of antediluvian remains. In one
song Ardjuno had a fort called Redjuno
built against the attacks of the giants, and
at Teguan, not far fi’om Redjuno, Dubois
placed the habitation of primitive man. Here
were found traces of fireplaces and bones
of buffalo, banteng, swine, deer and elephants
that had been cut and otherwise handled.
Near Trinil, on the same rich plateau,
Dubois discovered in 1892 the skull of the
famous Pithecanthropus crcctus, and de-
clared that it was here that man first grew
out of the loins of the ape-man and struggled
with his brutish forebear for survival.
Thence he found his way across the land-
bridge that once connected Celebes and Aus-
tralia, where he became the ancestor of the
Australian aborigine.
Outside the rain teemed, and the
gum-trees, planted by the Afforestation De-
partment after the last eruption, drooped in
the downpour like fretting prisoners rooted
in an alien soil. From every crevice of the
chimneyless houses smoke streamed, and a
scent of eucalyptus tinged the sodden air—
the only fuel the mountain people have is
the twigs and leaves from the lower branches
of the gums. Beyond the vague trees and
the vaguer houses came and went the faint
impression of a row of ruined temples. They
are the remains, half swamped in water, of
a holy city, at least 12 centuries old, that
Hindu devotees erected in this crater-pit
ringed by still active volcanoes. It was the
gradual filling of the pit by the eternal drip-
ping of the heavens that drove them out:
the tunnel cut through the rock, with which
they tried to drain their city, still exists
and prevents the water rising over the.miser-
able mat shelters of the aboriginal inhabi-
tants. It must have been amongst the same
primitive huts, and with the labor of their
owners, that the Hindu conquerors built
their temples and monasteries of stone: and
it must have been to the same drumming
accompaniment of the everlasting rains that
their slaves sat each night after their work
was done and listened to the ancient story
of the giant-wars and watched the strange
shadows on the screen.
I do not know how much of the Dubois
theory still holds good or what discoveries
like the Talgai and the Taungs skulls have
done to it; but it was easy to imagine, sit-
ting in the damp twilight of Heel* Wielandt’s
pendopo, with the old hags squatting at our
feet, and the rain, the dalang’s voice and
the native orchestra beating on our brains,
that we were really at a representation of
the great drama of man’s first advent on
this troubled stage.
FENG-SHUI.
The Garden Philosophy
There is a species of thought which wilts
away in the demonstration of it, as flowers
lose their freshness when they arc picked.
If we apply to it the canons of strict logic
we distort it; if we present it as a system
we shall be put down by the academicians,
whose delicate analysis will find it pregnant
with fallacies and contradictions. It is a
garden full of fair shrubs and possibilities
imperceptible to the professorial eye, and if
you have found it you will do well to keep
it to yourself, for everybody knows that a
naked * and unashamed Epicurean is inevit-
ably possessed of the morals of a suburban
cat. Nevertheless Epicurus himself was a
very pattern of virtue; it is even recorded
that he held that water was to be preferred
to wine. Stripped of artless errors of this
character, however, his philosophy is dis-
covered with the charm of adolescence on
it—as rare spirit has said, like the sun
on running water. It is close to the heart
of things; of course, it is illogical.
Green hedonism was calm and restrained
always in its quest after pleasure. The
aesthetic consciousness which finally united
the Athenians in a short-lived, perfect com-
monalty gave evidence of the potency of a
common appreciation of beauty to weld men
together. So Nietzsche said that Socrates
was the destroyer of Athenian greatness,
because he taught the Greeks to think. Old
Aristippus of Cyrene wanted to be master
of things and not mastered by them, and
lie was not obsessed with the exclusive charms
of the taverns, as Minar ud-din Ibrahim al
Khayyam was wont to be. The exquisite
joy of the moment, which for the Cyrenaie
was the only good, was a spontaneous exal-
tation not to he found in vintages ageing in
cobwebbed flasks. Epicurus, w 7 ho kept his
pleasant country household contented on a
diet of fresh fruit and contemplation, called
the greatest good Ataraxia —freedom from
care. Attainable through the moderation of
emotions and the equilibration of temper,
Ataraxia blessed its lovers with serenity and
inward peace, the highest that man can pos-
sess. It cannot, of course, be maintained
that there was any startling originality about
this conception, for Demokritos had glorified
cheerfulness of temper long before, though
the propagation of his idea of Euthumia did
not stay the hands of the citizens of Athens
when they burnt the books which had brought
him such fair fame and as much applause.
But the laughing philosophy gained a fresh
infusion of spirit and life in its sojourn with
the joyous fraternity outside the city wall.
The Epicureans preached always against the
restless inconstancy that followed the gleam
of the instant for the instant only; against
extravagant indulgence and undue excitation
and the reduction of delight to animal satis-
faction. Push-pin was not as good as poetry,
and the secret of happiness was emancipa-
tion from the exactions of riotous passion.
So hedonism in strange fashion becomes a
kind of quietism: morality is peace of mind
and contentment of spirit. High among the
virtues is friendship, for “of all the means
which are procured by wisdom to ensure
happiness in life, by far the most important
is the acquisition of friends.”
Now, it is true that effort and struggle,
which constitute the essence of an active
life, were abhorrent to the members of this
quiet community of gentle spirits: the air
of the garden probably was enervating, and
so far is the criticism commonly levelled
against the philosophy justified. .Still, arid
intellectualism of the kind typical of devotees
of pure thought and auction-bridge never
brought much happiness to anyone, and em-
bittered dialectic distilled of large and musty
tomes and rigorous abstention will fail of
its purpose if it seeks to destroy the joy of
life by demonstrating the intransigeancy of
the world of the senses. For, after all is
said, it is in this world that we see and
hear and feel and create that we have to
live out the tale of our mortal days. Some-
times it overcomes its disadvantages rather
well, too, as when it changes its frocking
day and night, summer and winter, and
misses no beauty in the doffing and donning.
The Germans have satisfied themselves in
a thousand ponderosities that morality can
be measured, cut to a pattern for all men,
and nicely laid out in hidden glory-boxes:
they tell us that the submission of the warm
individual to the frigid rigidity of universal
reason is the only conceivable end of morality
and mortality. Says Fichte: “If anyone
think this morality to be austere and painful
I cannot help him, for there is no other.”
They lived and live, these moralists; but, as
Anatole has cried: “Oh, how little!”
BRIAN C. FITZPATRICK.
English as She is Spoke
I am glad that “1.A.11.” (R.P. 26/2/’25)
supports my contention that h has no legiti-
mate claim to its position in any word begin-
ning with wh, and his implication that we
might spell the words more accurately by
reverting to the obsolete form occasionally
found (which would make “when” “hwen”)
further strengthens my case. The English
language is so bristling with irregularities
and difficulties that, when the public finds
it is not constrained to attempt the impos-
sible task of pronouncing the h after the w,
it certainly will not bother to make it ante-
cedent.
My headmaster half a century ago was, in
addition to being an LL.D. and a 8.A., a
linguist and etymologist of considerable repu-
tation. For years I had frequent opportuni-
ties of receiving personal, and hearing gen-
eral, addresses from him, and can guarantee
he never gave the slightest indication that
there was an h in the initial tvh. Also, our
rector, who had the right to append most of
the alphabet to his name, though he modestly
used only LL.D. and D.D., had no use what-
ever for the hin wh. Neither had any edu-
cated Englishman 50 years ago. It was only
about that time, when a certain cult started
a crazy idea of trying to make the pronun-
ciation conform to the spelling instead of from
time to time (as necessity arose) correcting
the spelling to suit the pronunciation, that
a number of people began to try to pro-
nounce the hin wh. Finding it impossible to
do so after the w, they put it before. About
the same time the same reformers tried to
get “are” pronounced like “air” and “said”
like “sayd.” But colloquialism had made the
words disagree with their spelling, and they
will probably continue so to disagree. Elderly
people will remember how reformers of the
same class seized on a few inoffensive words,
and, having convicted them of a French or
ultimately Latin origin, endeavored to put
them back to their French pronunciation.
Thus “obleege’’ became almost common, but.
later died a natural death. Again, of all
the words commencing with “en,” “envelope”
as a noun (but. strange to stay, not as a
verb) had the first syllable converted collo-
quially to ong. This has been semi-success-
ful, as half the public says “envelop” and
the others split the difference and say
“onvelop.” Incidentally, the best business
houses, and even literary men, as far as I
can observe, for “inclose” or “inclosure”
write “enclose” or “enclosure.”
Dr. Johnson said that the correct pro-
nunciation of a word was that which was
used by the greatest number of educated
people. Therefore, more or less, spelling
must follow pronunciation. But as in modern
times there is a certain tendency to eliminate
or rather correct irregularities, it is hopeful
that in time the English language, in spite
of its immense and increasing vocabulary,
may be simplified. Especially if we have a
controlling—or, rather, guiding—Academy,
as “1.A.H.” suggests.
WILLIAM CLOWES.
A Satchel of Books
The House by the Road, by Charles J. Dutton
(John Lane). A mystery yarn that moves in a
familiar groove, so that the experienced reader will
spot the culprit before the appointed chapter of
revelation is reached. But Bartley, the criminal in-
vestigator, is a likeable chap and it is not every ’tee
who cun discourse on eighteenth-century French litera-
ture.
Doctor Doolittle’s Post Office and The Story of
Mrs. Tubbs, by Hugh Lofting (Jonathan Cape). This
reviewer’s younger daughter at the age of three drew
moving figures full of sinister and derisive life. Since
attending school she has completely lost the faculty.
Hugh Lofting has obviously never been to school
and that accounts for his continued great success.
His books are a lesson to those wrfl-meaning people
who “write down” to children.
The Kangaroo Keeps on Talking, by L. St. Clare
Grondona (Victoria Publishing House). The object
of this book is set out in an introduction by the
British Prime Minister, Mr. Baldwin. “It has,” he
writes, “been the author’s endeavor to anticipate
with an answer any question which might reasonably
be expected to arise in the minds of those of his
readers who may contemplate making their future
homes in the All-British Continent.” His remark
that “there is a ring of truth, good-humor and good-
fellowship in every chapter” may be endorsed —as to
the sound of the metal, anyway, though there may be
some doubt as to the metal’s intrinsic value. The
volume, which is well illustrated and well got up,
should, in any case, be an important piece of immi
gration propaganda.
Magic of Dawn, by Mrs. Henry A. Doudy (Hutchin-
son). If Mrs. Doudy’s knowledge of the storyteller’s
craft were as great as her enthusiasm for the
“Queen City of the Sout/h,” this tale of early
Adelaide and Sturt’s exploration would be a notable
addition to Australian literature. She has quite a
faculty for depicting sunny landscapes, and has
immersed herself in the history of the period, but
she is the most delightfully unsophisticated novel
ist that ever wrote. Her method is as
transparent as a child’s. Each character intro-
duces himself with a personal explanation quite in
the manner of the Chinese stage. The atmosphere of
80 years ago is obtained by making somebody find a
copy of the S. Australian Register and read out items
about Queen Victoria the Good and her courtship
with Prince Albert the Better. The pioneers con-
verse like a chorus from Euripides, except wjhen they
discuss politics in the manner of a leading article.
The hero is a prig.


Here’s Costly Bookkeeping!

§S
?e.
Pen, ink, blotter and eraser cost
very little to buy —but how expen-
sive they prove when you find er-
rors in your ledgers; when your
trial balance is five to ten days late;
when your statements are late in
getting to the mails; when your
bookkeeper spends nights looking
for errors; when you cannot get the
figures you absolutely need to man-
age your business successfully.
How different it is with a Bur-
roughs Automatic Bookkeeping
Machine on the job!
In the first place, a Burroughs
enables you to obtain, easily and
quickly, the figures that tell you
the exact condition of every phase
of your business every day. It
shows you where you are making
—or losing —money.
It proves every day’s work every
day. Hence there is no month-
end congestion—no trial balance
troubles —no overtime —and cus-
tomers’ statements can be mailed
promptly.
Call the Burroughs man to-day
and ask for a complete demonstra-
tion on your own work. Or, if
more convenient, mail the coupon.
There is absolutely no obligation.

God’s Splendid Sin.
Tired of llis everlasting loneliness,
Night-anguished as the troubled stars of
space,
God turned from Heaven His piteous wlntr
face
And the earth felt the fire of liis caress.
The cosmos paused a moment in distress
And the mazed worlds that through the
leons race
Gasped at the magnitude of that em-
brace. ...
God said, “Let Us make man.” Nor moye
nor less.
And when He looked into their garden fair
And saw the man and woman He was
shamed.
He hid His face and wept a little while;
His salt tears mixed with the thin drifting
air.
“I shall be I,” he said, and nothing
blamed.
Now Heaven is filled with His eternal
smile.

Ah, let me weep a little while for ways
That once I trod!
Let me lament those blue-bright summer
days;
And ah, de&r God,
Let me forget a while
That last, long, lonely mile—
The lights behind me, and the new-turn'd
sod!
Then let the tears upon my face burn dry
In bitter shame
That I have dared, while summer lingered
nigh,
To walk so lame
Along her sun-gold ways!
Ring wild, O living days,
O’er tranced silence at death's whispered

Burning; Leaves.
’Twixt break of day and sun’s first bright
ray turning
The palm-trees’ topmost leaves to fans of
gold,
The smoke and scent of gum-leaves near by
burning
Awaken old-time memories that hold
Within their depths a long-forgotten yearn-
ing
For distant scenes, past years and friends
of old.
Again I hear the bush-fires fiercely roaring;
The green leaves craekle as the flames
sweep by,
While hollow limbs of mighty trees outpour-
ing
Great clouds of murky smoke that dim the
sky
Breathe blazing sparks iu glowing showers
soaring
To spread destruction wheresoe’er they fly.
Again the night wind passing by caresses
With gentle touch the trees’ young, tender
leaves;
With smoke wreaths delicate as fairies’
tresses
Again the camp-fire changing patterns
weaves;
Again in roseate garb the Future dresses
The golden visions that the brain con-
ceives.
In station huts 1 seek the forms and faces
On which at night the cheerful firelight
shone,
Only to find that strangers fill their places
And years long past seem dreary viewed
alone
When burnt-out embers are the only traces
Of all the youthful fires that we have
known.

In a Lonely Hour.
A little bird is crying in my heart—
A-crying for someone, something to come!
The sky is ashen-pale, the big drops start,
The winds among the wiry tussocks thrum.
If over all the summer sun were strong
And vagrant blooms down every breeze
were blown,
Then we should now be singing song on song,
Forgetting always that we sang alone.
A little bird is crying in my heart.
Be still, be still, O tiny, restless wing!
No one will come to us who dream apart,
Save Beauty with her sweet, sad offering.

Ocean Birds.
How could the steamers come
By blue hill and hollow—
How could the ships steer home
With no birds to follow?
Darkly the storm-clouds loom,
Tumbling and rolling;
From the loud engine-room
Deep bells seem tolling.
Blithely the petrels swing,
Circling and crying;
Death’s but a little thing
To ocean birds crying.
But when the home lights gleam
And slow move the pistons
Faintlv the sea-birds scream
In the dark distance.
Pilots of ocean’s track,
Whose blue hollows hide them.
How could the ships come back
With no birds to guide them?

THE TWO CRUISERS.
When introducing the Defence Equipment
Bill last session, the Prime Minister said
that the Government had decided on the
construction of two 10,000-ton cruisers to
replace the obsolete Sydney and Melbourne,
and that, since time was an important con-
sideration, one of them would be built in
Britain. As regards the other, the Govern-
ment was “anxious” to have it constructed
in Australia, but its ardor had been checked
by reports that a local contract would be
at least 50 p.c. more expensive than the
current British price, and the matter would
have to stand over till more precise infor-
mation was available. Presently the esti-
mates in the Government’s possession were
referred to Monash, who advised against
Australian construction on the ground that
“the cost of building a 10,000-ton cruiser at
Cockatoo Dock, Sydney, would, upon any
set of assumptions, be £1,000,000 more than
the sum for which such a cruiser could be
purchased from a British dockyard,” and
that the £1,000,000 could be more usefully
spent in other directions. The decision was,
however, deferred until tenders had been re-
ceived, tenderers being asked to quote for
two British-built cruisers, for one to be built
in Britain and one in Australia, and for
the Commonwealth contract onlv. John
Brown and Co., who constructed H.M.S.
Hood and the Lusitania, offered to do both
jobs for £4,250,000. An unnamed British
nrm wanted to build one cruiser in its own
yard and the second at Cockatoo Dock, the
latter to be placed at its disposal "tree of
cost, depreciation or maintenance,” which
arrangement, it is calculated, would result
in the unknown’s warship being £1,170,882
dearer than one of Brown’s. Tne Common-
wealth Shipping Board, which also pro-
posed to use Cockatoo, quoted £BlB,lOB
more than Brown’s price for one cruiser, and
the \\ alsli Island quotation was £1,075,040
more. And each of these Government ten-
ders or estimates was "dependent on varia-
tion m wages and hours of work,” so the
I rime Minister declares, and in the case
ot the Shipping Board “on variations in
cost ot materials and cargo rates also,”
while the Commonwealth would have only
its own taxpayers to come on if the esti-
mate was exceeded-r-as happens with deadly
regularity on all big departmental works,
in Brown’s case, however, if prices and
wages rise and the British Parliament re-
duces the working week from 48 hours to
44 (as the N. S. Wales Labor Party proposes
to do if it gets into power in a couple of
months), the British contractor, not the
Australian taxpayer, will have to stand the
racket. The Clydebank firm has been given
the contract, and the difference between its
figure for one cruiser and the lowest Aus-
tralian estimate is to be applied to the
building of a seaplane carrier in the Com-
monwealth.
* * * *
The decision is one from which no sup-
porter of Australian industry can extract any
pleasure; yet it would be idle to deny that
the Prime Minister, assuming that he has
placed the facts squarely before the public
and that there is no flaw in his arithmetic,
has made out a case. And he has been
supplied with abundant means of defending
his position by tin; Labor people who are
now railing at him —by the too-fluent
Anstey, M.H.11., who, as deputy-leader of
the party, moved that “expenditure on naval
construction be deferred for the present” and
asked why Australia should “waste our
money in building these two cruisers”; by
Maiiony, M.H.R., who, when Anstey’s
amendment was defeated, proposed that “any
sum spent on naval construction should be
expended in Australia, thus relieving the
distress caused by unemployment”; by the
union officials who took up the ignominious
cry that naval construction should be a form
of pauper relief, and by those other union
officials who have been holding up Common-
wealth Government steamers, State Govern-
ment steamers, privately-owned Australian
steamers, privately-owned British and M.L.
steamers—in fact, every shipping interest they
could pick a quarrel with except Asiatic and
German concerns; the i/ have never been in-
terfered with. Even if one of the 10,000-
ton cruisers were built in Australia, a large
proportion of the material —S 5 p.c., it is
calculated—would have to be imported. That
material, seeing that it would be consigned
to a Government dockyard, would have to
be carried in one of the steamers of that
Government fleet which, thanks to the pranks
of the imported Walsiies and Johanssens,
has. become the joke of the Seven Seas. On
arrival at Sydney—if it ever did arrive—-
the material would be handled —if it
ever was handled—by the Waterside Workers’
Federation, which refused to unload coal
for the 11.A.N. because the s.s. Volumnia
was chartered in England by the Common-
wealth Government, or because Tom Walsh
hates Havelock Wilson, or for some other
reason which has never been made clear.
And if the Walsh and W.W.F. barriers
were passed, the job would be controlled by
organisations one section of which declined
to repair a damaged steamer because the
captain lmd taken court proceedings against
the crew, and another struck work on the
Commonwealth Government steamer Ero-
manga because it was getting some cargo
from the “black” Volumnia.
* * * *
It is easy to throw mud at the Prime
Minister, and his tepid statement of the
position is certainly trying; but what en-
couragement has his Government received
from the controllers of Australian unions
interested in ships and shipbuilding that it
should place important features of its naval
and financial policies at their mercy? What
guarantee could it give the people for whose
sea-defence it is responsible that the second
cruiser, if undertaken in Sydney or New-
castle, would not cost half as much again
or twice as much as the stipulated price,
and would be delivered before the type had
become obsolescent, if not obsolete? The
Bulletin wants to see every Australian war-
ship built in Australia, and that of Aus-
tralian material, from conning-tower to keel,
but it is not keen on having the building
done in a Government dockyard in some
centre of industrial turbulence; nor need
the Commonwealth be restricted to a choice
between Cockatoo and Walsh Island. It
would probably get much better results in
some place like Albany (W.A.) or Mary-
borough (Q.), where the shipbuilding staffs
would be withdrawn from the felicities of
Joiianssen’s speeches and Jock Garden’s
conversation, and have leisure to reflect that
this country is not Russia or Ireland or
Holland, but their own Australia.
* * * ®
In any case a locally-built fleet is a vain
aspiration while the Labor attitude is that
it is a crime to have warships of any descrip-
tion, since Australia, which excludes immi-
grants from certain countries, can preserve
itself, should it be violently smitten by
one of those countries, by offering the other
cheek; that if warships are built they should
be regarded as unemployed-relief jobs like
stone-breaking and sand-shifting; that in
such cases time is no object and the greater
the cost of the vessels the longer will the
men be kept employed: and that irritation
and sympathetic strikes, especially when a
non-Labor Government is in office, are justi-
fiable breaks in the monotony of the weekly
grind, which on no account should exceed
five days unless thumping overtime rates
are paid. Naval construction in Australian
yards should be the settled policy of the
nation, but it can only become the settled
policy of the nation when the unions con-
cerned show that they regard the building of
a warship, not as a vote-catching dodge to be
strung out till the crack of doom, but as a
job to be tackled faithfully and completed
with all convenient speed, since it may pos-
sibly decide the fate of this Commonwealth;
and when they furnish guarantees that in no
circumstances will they go on strike or
declare naval-construction material “black,”
though imported blatherskites roar till they
are blue in the face.
SAVING MACDONALD’S SOUL.
“Speaking in the House of Commons, Mr. Ramsay
Macdonald said the construction of the Singapore
base would enable the White Australia policy to be
pursued, and a quarrel between Japan and Australia
was then certain, leading possibly to a general en-
counter between the white and yellow races. The
Empire, he added, did not consist solely of Australia
and Newfoundland. Other parts of the Empire dis-
agreed with the Singapore scheme.”— Cablegram.
Ramsay Macdonald is understood to repre-
sent British Labor sentiment with the reser-
vation that he is less “advanced” and revolu-
tionary than the bulk of the party would
wish. So when he appeared in the House
of Commons the other day as anti-Wliite
Australian and pro-Japanese, it may be in-
ferred that the only thing wrong with him
from the bulk-of-tlie-party’s point of view
Was that lie was insufficiently yellow. Ever
since Britain began to be contaminated,
irom Russia and other places of smudged
reputation, with the Communistic idea that
all men are brothers except the white “bour-
geoisie,” and that any kind of tinted char-
acter is extra brotherly, and that it is a
duty to mix and thus beget mongrels as a
protest against patriotism, the White Aus-
tralia idea has been at a discount in British
Labor circles. It was never regarded there
as much more than a local fad, but the in-
difference shows signs of developing into
rancorous hatred since the British Labor
party took the Sovieteer to its bosom, the
Sovieteer being largely Asiatic, often dingy
enough to look more Asiatic than he is, and
an employer of Chinese mercenaries in a
brotherly way to help to suppress European
political opponents. And with an appa-
rently large class, which is suspected to be
a growing class, White Australia is now at
a discount in Australia itself. When the
choice lies between patriotism and racial
purity on one side and the poisonous guff
which is imported from Moscow on the other,
the Red Objective crowd is anti-White Aus-
tralian all the time. Now that loyalty to
Moscow, and loyalty to the disagreeable
Ramsay Macdonald, and unswerving devo-
tion to the international or mongrel creed
have become one and the same, the Red ele-
ment, which is tolerated here with such
amazing laxity, should develop a new burst
of energy.
* * * #
The British Labor attitude is that a Singa-
pore naval base might help the White Aus-
tralia idea, and is anathema for that very
reason, White Australia being branded as
an accursed thing and worth discouraging
even at yery considerable risk. The base
about which so much frenzy has arisen is
really a very simple business proposition. It
isn’t a new idea or a new aggression, but
rather a proposal to bring an old institution
up to date. Singapore, with the British-
Indian Empire on one side, Australia and
Maoriland on the other and various British
sundries in the offing, holds a fairly central
position in the midst of an ill-defended area
(ill-defended in a naval sense) which is
nearly half the Empire for size, and over
three-fourths of it for population. In the
space for which it is supposed to provide
naval protection are situated six out of
the seven greatest ports which the Empire
possesses outside Britain itself. Singapore
itself is credited with nearly £102,000.000
of annual commerce, so the people in Lon-
don take a natural interest in it. The atti-
tude assumed by the Ramsay Macdonald
Government and maintained by the Ram-
say Macdonald Opposition is that a naval
base at Singapore will be a menace to Japan,
just as a naval base in England is a men-
ace to Europe, and one in Canada or South
Africa is a veiled threat to America and
Africa. But apparently, in the bright lexi-
con of Macdonald and his friends, it is
only when the hostile or defensive attitude
is located in the neighborhood of a brown
Power that it becomes a deadly sin. “Ges-
tures” of suspicion toward white Pow r ers
don’t matter. Certainly the nearest Jap-
anese port which is big enough to matter
is 3020 marine miles, or about 3500 land
miles, from Singapore; but the Japanese of
Ramsay Macdonald’s mind is a dreadfully
huffy person, and takes offence even when
the width of China and Indo-China and
the Malay Peninsula is between him and
the cause of his rage. Moreover, he is
bound, in the view of Macdonald, to come
down the Pacific and burst violently on
Australia, and break into, our domestic
affairs, unless we open the door, in which
case he will burst in just the same, and do
all these nasty deeds, but without violence
or with less violence. Rather than not
make the destruction of the White Australia
idea certain, the crank from Lossiemouth
would leave British marine interests all the
way from Bombay to Melbourne without
the adequate protection which the Singapore
base is intended to supply.
* * «• *
The ex-Primo Minister went out of his
way to remind the people here that Aus-
tralia isn’t all the Empire. It certainly
isn’t, but it is not much short of one-fourth
of the Empire. And it has a future, pro-
vided it isn’t ruined by Ramsay Mac-
donald’s international friends, and provided
it can get hold of a statesman or two in whom
the pioneering instinct isn’t dead. Mac-
donald's own country, sad to say. seems
rather short of a future, for last estimates
were to the effect that its population had
started on the down grade. But it would
be well if the Macdonalds, both in the
United Kingdom and here, would get it into
their heads that Moscow also isn’t the
whole Empire, and. in fact, isn’t any part of
the Empire. The Irishman has been accused
of mistaking Ireland for the whole map,
but the Communistic idea that Moscow is
the globe and something over is a much more
consuming emotion. When a person with a
pious upbringing like Macdonald goes on
a nigger and Communistic rampage against
his own race and color, the natural deduc-
tion is that he thinks he has found a gospel,
and imagines he is making himself accept-
able to the Almighty and paving his way
to Heaven. Something might be said here
concerning Solomon’s statement about his
chances (Ecclesiastes, chapter iii.. verses
19 and 20),.but that may be left on one
side. I lie outstanding matter is that if Ram-
SAY Macdonald wants to save his soul he
should, in common honesty, do it at his own
expense and not at ours.
THE LOST LEADER.
The history of a nation is largely the his-
tory of its great men. Movements and causes
are often forgotten or have been obscured by
the actions of those who were thrown into
the world's limelight by them. Almost every
casual reader has a fair idea of the career
of Julius Caesar; comparatively few have
any notion of the conditions in Rome and
Italy which made such a career possible.
Cromwell is widely recognised as a tre-
mendous figure in English story; much
fewer have a grasp of the facts about that
Puritanism of the hanging days of Eliza-
beth and the hopeless years of James I.
which explain the Protector. The history
of Greece is a confusion of parish records
and municipal infamies till the great
names emerge; then it takes form and life.
Feeling that the story of the world is a
series of biographies without context, many
modern attempts have been made to write
of the past in terms of customs, conditions
and aims without special reference to the
great figures; but in almost every case-such
works are crowded with minor names, and
the result has been the resurrection of the
little leaders at the expense of their greater
contemporaries. It is, of course, a fact that
many of the people who filled the stage
were not really great; history has preserved
them because they filled the eye of their
own time. Richard of the Lion Heart
gets a lot of room in the survey of early
Plantagenet times, though he had no quality
of statesmanship to entitle him to his last-
ing honors. But the reason is evident
enough. This person, with vast muscular
strength, foolhardy courage and effeminate
tastes, was the ideal of the ineffective age
in which he lived. Greatness is not a
quality that can be measured by mathe-
matics or analysed by chemistry. A great
man of one age is not necessarily less than
great because he was mentally and morally
unfit to lick the boots of a thousand men
of some earlier or later age. His greatness
is relative to those about him ; and there is
never any telling how he might have broad-
ened or developed in another environment.
The man who says Nelson could be beaten
at sea to-day by any captain of a gunboat is
talking a vain thing, for Nelson would still
have been the daring thinker with the action
close upon the thought whether he com-
manded Noaii’s ark or the Hood.
* * * *
This stressing of the man in history to the
exclusion of the mob is essentially right. In
the long run the man is more than the
movement, the action more important than
the plan. This is seen even in the religious
sphere. No two things could be wider apart
than the teaching of Quakerism and of Catholi-
cism ; yet at the mention of the name of
Jesus Christ the thoughts of both Quaker
and Catholic turn in the same direction. It
was this emphasis on the individual which
caused the pleasant but never very real
gods of Paganism to fade away before their
stronger religious rivals. ‘ History instinc-
tively recognises this principle. The meaning
of a Reform Bill fades out rapidly, and the
old feeling roused by it can never be
adequately represented to any future mind;
but the meaning of a Gladstone remains
—wilted a little and in a less highly colored
setting—to tell the world something it still
desires to know. And if the great man re-
mains in perspective as of infinitely more
importance than the mob, though closely
related to it, it is no great step to argue
that the great man is the age, or that the
value of an age is to be measured by
its production of great men. As the man’s
greatness is only relative to that of other
men of. his time, this looks almost like a
contradiction; but it is not so in reality.
The great man’s place is relative to that of
the people about him, but it is largely based
on their recognition of him. The man who
fails when the hour strikes fails for good;
the non-recognition of whatever claims he
lias by his contemporaries is forever fatal
to him. When, therefore, we say that the
age which produces most great men is the
greatest age we are practically saying that
the age which best recognises its leaders is
the greatest age. The recognition of the
best leaders that can be found, and the
honest support given to them, means that
the age has recognised its own outstanding
qualities of thought and endeavor, and is
willing to follow the best plans of which it
is capable.
* * * *
The charge against modern democracy is
that it fails to produce outstanding leaders.
The broadening of the franchise in many
lands has made this more and more evident;
and it has even been a matter of propaganda
in certain political circles. That men in
office need not be statesmen or leaders as
long as they will blindly obey the orders of
political organisations as expressed by the
votes of conferences lias been the idea; and
in practice it has failed a little more lament-
ably than most short-cuts to perfect govern-
ment. The truth lies in the old fable about
the body and its members. The bead must
give a lead to the rest of the body or the
whole game of living becomes drunk and dis-
orderly. The fact that, according to some
modern scientists, the thinking process is
distributed through the whole nervous system
and is not entirely confined to the brain cells
only gives point to the allegory. All men
in the body politic do a certain amount of
thinking, but it is for the head to gather
that up, give force and direction to it. and
intimate to the body how T it is to be turned
to most practical use. The stagnant bog
into which Australian politics have drifted
may be directly traced to the absence of this
leadership. And the reason that Australia
is without leaders is largely that leaders
have not been seriously looked for. The
man who might prove to be the very brain
and heart of the community shrinks from
the bigger service of his country. lie sees
the machine of party dwarfing his efforts,
forcing him into a groove in which he does
not wish to run : he feels the pulse of the
time and knows that in return for giving his
vital force to promote reform he will have
only a temporary notoriety, no real honor,
no warm national gratitude. In every


other direction the rewards. are bigger for
the big man ; in no other direction are the
rewards anything like so large for the small
man. So the game is left to the small
man; and democracy discovers that it has
an elaborate machine and no voice, huge
tasks undertaken and no deed done that sug-
gests even an appreciation of the nature of
those tasks.
THE INVIDIOUS POSITION OF THE
U.S.A.
Senator Borah, Chairman of the Senate
Foreign Affairs Committee, replying to a
speech made in the French Chamber of
Deputies, said it was unjustifiable that
America should be regarded abroad as a
Shylock. The solicitude of Senator Borah
for the good name of his country is laudable.
But to declare that the foreign attitude
towards the U.S.A. is unjustifiable is not
sufficient to remove the cause of the post-
war feeling which is expressed fretfully by
comparing his country with the character
that, in the popular mind, stands, for all
that is ruthless, exacting and vindictive.
For the peace of America and Europe,
Senator Borah would be better employed
in seeking to remove the existing sullen ill-
will engendered by America holding so
many European countries in bondage, as a
result of her belated participation in the
fight to sweep back the tide of Prussian
aggression. Senator Boraii is free to state
that the attitude is unjustified, but he must
yet awaken to the stern fact that it is
inevitable, and can be removed only by an
abandonment of all semblance of an ad-
herence to the terms of the bond after the
manner of Siiakhpeare’s Jew. If Senator
Borah has no misgivings as to the right-
eous position of his country, vast numbers
of true Americans have. Many of them
are sorely disturbed in mind over the domi-
nating position in which their country Jias
been placed in consequence of the war—-
or rather, through her slow entry into .it.
They are representative of a large section
of the people who arc uneasy in their con-
science, and would hail with delight any
solution that would do justice to European
countries and retrieve their own from the
invidious position in which she is placed,
and in which the Borahs would keep her.
The plain fact is that America "cannot
have it both ways.” She cannot look for an
expression of real friendly sentiments, and
at the same time exact her pound of flesh;
she cannot hold both a place of enviable pride
and one of exasperating profit at the expense
of her late allies.
Dr. David Starr Jordan, who has been
awarded the $25,000 given by the World
Federation of Education for the best educa-
tion plan for the promotion of peace, based
his scheme on the cultivation of the spirit of
international amity by teaching children in
schools, and by correspondence and inter-
course between the youth of different
nations. Possibly the most striking, piece of
statuary of last year was “Reconciliation,”
chiselled in Paris. It indicates the grow-
ing hope of the times in representing two
young soldiers. French and German, em-
bracing one another on the lap of Peace.
The inspiring efforts of Dr. Jordan and of
all others will be futile if the U.S.A. per-
sists in keeping her late Allies in a state
of servitude. The staggering tribute to be
paid to her will run, as at pre.sent planned,
for generations, if not for all time. Britain’s
yearly contribution, for example, began in
1923 at $160,000,000, and progresses until
it reaches $175,000,000 in 1984. There Can
be no real peace and friendliness while toll
is exacted in repayment of loans that would
never have been needed if the U.S.A. had
stood side by side with her ultimate Allies
from the beginning. The violation of Bel-
gium dated from August 1914, not April
1917.
The U.S.A., as President Roosevelt
and other leading Americans admitted,
would not have escaped invasion if the
enemy had been victorious in Europe, any
more than we in Australia would have done
in that event. As early as May. 1.915. hv
the submarining of the Lusitania, 100
Americans lost their lives. If there had
been no internal division to restrain her.
the U.S.A. would have joined the Allies as
the result of such provocation. But just as
Lincoln could not take action for the free-
ing of the slaves “until the sentiment of the
people was so far advanced towards his own
point of view that what he did should find
support in it.” so it was with Woodrow
Wilson —he had to wait until the repeated
wanton acts of the enemy brought the public
mind of U.S.A. generally into that state in
which it was prepared to accept war. For
this delay the Allies were in no sense re-
sponsible. but the delay of the U.S.A. left
them to bear the whole burden of expendi-
ture and human sacrifice. If an account
were to be taken of the lives unnecessarily
lost and men maimed in consequence of the
delay, what would become of the monetary
claims of the U.S.A.? She should not focus
on money alone, but take a glance at the
appalling loss of life sustained by the Allies,
making her own sacrifices —regrettable
enough. God knows—sink into insignifi-
cance.
There is a curious hesitation in Britain
to state the position plainly; but in the
face of the groivth of enmity toward*
the U.S.A.. it is in the real interests of her
people to declare, openly how the position
is viewed abroad, and why it happens that
there is an occasional petulant outburst of
pent-up feeling such as that which irritated
Senator Boraii and stung him into warmth
in retaliation. This feeling will endure and
become intensified through the years unless
the U.S.A. has the truth candidly told to
her. The sense of fairness in her people will
be stirred to do justice to her late Allies
only by the truth being stated honestly. It
is necessary merely to give practical effect to
the inspiring sentiments uttered in America
from time to time. For instance, what can
be more encouraging than President
Coolidge’s utterance in Chicago, that “it
is our wish to live in a world that shall be
at peace. But we can no more assure per-
manent and stable peace without co-opera-
tion among the nations than we could assure
victory in war without allies amongst
them”? In every section of the, American
people there are many leaders of thought
who long to see their country emancipated
from its invidious position. One of the
foremost bankers of Wall-street agreed
that an adjustment of the total costs of the
war between U.S.A. and her Allies would be
equitable, and another who controlled an
important branch of the U.S.A. finances
during the war advocates a cancellation of
a portion of the debts of other nations on
a definite basis which he lays down. The
President would find great support in an
effort to bring about those conditions with-
out which it is idle to look for a permanent
and stable peace. .
On a certain historic occasion Woodrow'
Wilson, it is related, exclaimed “Damn
logic!” It may be well not to ride logic
to death, and we could well afford to ap-
proach a settlement in the broad and free
way in which business men are accus-
tomed to settle difficulties by a give-and-take
policy. Thus would be. avoided the per-
petuation of rancor with a_ growing cleav-
age between peoples whose interest it is to
be good friends. It is. however, a little
disappointing to find the New York Times
contrasting the subsidies granted by Britain
in the Nanoleonic wars with the loans made
by the IjTS.A. to the Allies, and stressing
tin 1 condition made by Congress, that pay-
ment by the Allies should be applied to meet-
ing the charge on the U.S.A. internal debt
contracted to raise the money. The Allies
were in the throes of the war and were not
in a position to stop fighting the common
enemy to haggle with a partner long waited
for in the struggle.
The first movement towards the establish-
ment of that enduring peace for which the
people of all nations so ardently long can
be secured only by an equitable settlement
of the costs of the war that will entail
upon the U.S.A. the necessity of vacating
her unequal and favored position. When
she releases her late Allies from the galling

PLAIN ENGLISH.
The Drift of the Country Party.
The Country party cranks, with their resur-
rected Freetrade craze, look the nearest, and
almost the largest, Australian danger of the
moment. They are silly and mindless vic-
tims of extraneous impostors, the same as
the Communist and the no-work theorist.
The Freetrade movement has always rested
on the influence of exporters outside who
want to make money by sending foreign
goods to us, and importers inside who ex-
pect to make money by receiving foreign
goods for us. The basis of the argument
has always been the alleged example ol
Britain. Because that country adopted
Freetrade, in the search for cheap raw
materials, when it had built up its manu-
factures so that they almost equalled those
of all the rest of the world, and when it
believed its supremacy fixed for all time,
therefore it is claimed'that Australia should
try the same nostrum when it doesn't want
imported raw materials, and its manufac-
tures are only struggling, and have only in
the rarest instances reached the exporting
stage. Because Britain adopted Freetrade
when its native manufacturers wanted it,
Australia, it is urged, should adopt the
same policy when the native manufacturers
don’t want it but the foreign importers do.
The farming class has. to a considerable ex-
tent. been beguiled into the importing camp,
and the Country party has become, in a
great measure, a new tail to the old body
of city importers. The movement began with
a plea for the abolition of import duties on
the “necessaries” of the bucolic art, but it
is growing into an agitation for the removal
of the duties on clothes, boots, hats, woollen
and cotton piece goods, and many other
articles, all of which the agriculturist uses
also, and on motor-cars, which he employs
occasionally. It has further developed,
especially in Westralia. into a demand _for
the free importation of railway-building
material, because the farmer uses the rail-
ways the same as other people, though, by
reason of the extra-low rates charged on his
bulky output, he is an unprofitable cus-
tomer. In fact, the farmer is presented as
somebody quite apart from the rest of
the working community, but not from
the importing community. And he has im-
bibed the conviction that, if the importer
is given a chance to destroy local manufac-
turing by the dumping process, he will no
more dream of taking advantage of his
monopoly than a shipping combine would of
putting up freights when competition was
removed. Meanwhile he appears to have
practically mislaid the party's original mis-
sion. The main features thereof were to
create new States, and thereby make new
ports which would save millions of annual
miles of needless haulage, and new industrial
centres which would bring the farmer's cus-
tomers to his door. Through very inferior
management the party has drifted into doing
the work of the city importing interests,
which care nothing for anv of these things,
nor.- for that matter, do they care, so long
as the Customs exactions are cut down to
zero, if the bedrock railway rates now
charged on agricultural produce have to be
doubled to make up the loss.

Training and Temperament,
From an old drill-sergeant:—
In the training of our Citizen Army what is
wanted is a system based on the experience gained
in the training of the army Australia put in the
field in the late war. In that disturbance we sent
to the Front thousands of men with less than six
months’ actual training, who proved themselves as
good fighting machines as the world has yet produced.
We who had to train them know that it was a
pleasure to teach them the essentials of soldiering,
but it was a quite different matter teaching them
the stuff that is only necessary on ceremonial parades.
The men who went to the war went to fight for
Australia’s honor, and were enthusiastic to learn
anything that would make them fighters; but any-
thing they were taught with the object of making
them smart ceremonial soldiers left them cold. I
am quite convinced that the same spirit holds with
the compulsory trainee. Submit him to a syllabus of
training that makes the use of arms the paramount
feature, with just sufficient squad drill to make his
unit mobile, and you will find that, although he
may not enjoy his training as much as he does
a game of football or cricket, he will take an
interest in it. For believe me the rising gene-
ration of Australians are just as patriotic as their
fathers.
The principal objection civilian soldiers had to the
British system was the importance attached to
ceremonial soldiering. Any man that served in the
late war will tell of instances of this weakness.
In the Bullecourt business in May, 1917, the
3rd Brigade was so badly cut up that it was neces-
sary that it should rest until sufficiently reinforced
to bring it up to fighting strength. My battalion
(the llth) was reduced to such straits that there
were not more than a half-dozen men who knew
how to fire a Lewis gun. The battalion went into
billets, and in due course reinforcements started to
arrive. These men were raw ; the majority of them
knew nothing about the Lewis gun and Mills gren-
ades, and very little about the handling of the rifle
and bayonet. Did we settle down to teach them?
Wo did not! H.Q. was of the opinion that we
needed battalion drill, and battalion drill it was.
Keen at this distance my blood boils when T think
of the days - we wasted blankoing our equipment
and doing evolutions on the parade ground at a
time when the new arrivals were begging for
education in the use of the weapons on which their
lives would be depending they knew not how soon.
A couple of months later the battalion was waiting
in billets for the offensive that was initiated at
Menin-road in September, 1917. An Order came
from Army H.Q. something in this wise: “It has
been observed that members of the 3rd Brigade have
not been giving the attention to saluting that is
essential to the discipline of the Army. This state
of affairs cannot be permitted to continue. O.C.
units will see that units receive each day a half-
hour’s instruction in saluting”; and the writer
had to go through the farce of instructing nun,
some of whom were present at the Landing, in
saluting by numbers.
To make the training of our boys attractive to
them, and consequently effective in its results, we
must have regard to the Australian temperament.
Work in with that and you can produce the finest
fighters in the world. Fly in the face of it and you
will imperil any system of defence at all.

Captain Conk’s Bones.
“Ancient Mariner” : Ambrose Pratt nTay
be well postpd in the doings of Tiiunder-
bolt anti other immortals of the same
species, but he has still something to learn
about Captain Cook. Me tells Melbourne
that while on a visit to Honolulu he was
astonished to learn that Cook’s remains
are buried in the soil of a foreign country—
to wit. the island of Hawaii. Apparently
he has never taken the trouble to verify the
information, so he has launched a proposal
to invite Uncle Sam’s fleet to call in at
Hawaii, on the way to these shores, for the
purpose of digging up Cook’s remains, and
bringing them along for re-interment at
Canberra. In the light of the incontro-
vertible facts, it would be ridiculous for
Stanley Bruce to approach his Uncle Sam
with such a proposal. Cook was killed on
February 14, 1775, and his body—owing to
what may be euphemistically termed the in-
action., of the lieutenant (Williamson) who
was in charge of the ship’s launch —was left
exposed on the beach, along with the bodies
of the four marines killed- at the same time,
until carried away by the savages to the
rising ground at the back of their village. Re-
membering that these savages were anthro-
pophagi,' what followed may be left to the
reader’s imagination. A week later the
greater portion of Cook’s bones were re-
covered from the natives, and on being de-
posited in a coffin were disposed as follows
(ride the Resolution’s log entry) :
The 21st Feb.—At sunset fired ten minute guns,
with the colors half-staff up, when the remains of
our late commander were committed to the deep.
The monument raised on the island by the
Americans 50 years ago was meant to mark
the spot where Cook was killed, not where
be was buried.

Medicine and Mastic.
Some interesting details came out in the
B.M.A.’s recent prosecution in Maoriland of
Dr. Dtjndas Mackenzie, a registered prac-
titioner who found new methods of healing
more successful, or at any rate more profit-
able. than of old. Mackenzie, a graduate
of Otago University, as an ordinary physi-
cian was not an extraordinary success. He
went to U.S.A., where the late Dr. Abrams
somewhat hurriedly initiated him into the
workings of his now famous magic box.
This apparatus is divided into two sections.
There is a machine, with numerous circuits,
many of which are considered by electricians
to be redundant and only introduced to make
the thing impressive, which diagnoses the
complaint; and there is another which,' so
it is claimed, cures it. The method of diag-
nosis is simple. The spittle, blood or perspi-
ration of a patient, or anything that he has
“polluted” by his touch, gives off vibrations
which the arrangement is capable of measur-
ing. Having discovered the natural wave-
length of chicken-pox or pimples, the opera-
tor applies to the patient vibration from
another apparatus called an oscilloclast.
which, if they are of the proper frequency,
will rout or dissipate the vibrations of _ in-
fection or diseased organic growth. Scien-
tific investigation of the contraption is in-
hibited because, like spiritualistic mediums,
Abrams’s followers are compelled to work
in the dark to avoid frightening the “re-
actions” away. Mackenzie introduced this
wonder-worker to the unsophisticated inhabi-
tants of Maoriland with instant success. He
claims to have treated over 3000 cases, and
says he became so expert that he was able to
diagnose obscure complaints by looking at
the patient’s handwriting. lie was even
able to tell a patient not only that he was
ill, but that he was rapidly getting worse,
all from the one specimen of caligraphy.
The interesting fact remains, however, that
he did make cures. Numerous witnesses,
including a doctor, arose to swear that he
freed them of diseases ranging from paraly-
sis to boils. In the same way the chiro-
practors, who claim to he able to “manipu-
late” the spine, can point to cures. An
American citizen whose doctrine was that
the entire nervous system was centred in
the feet cured large numbers in Adelaide
by maldng patients sit in a' darkened room
with their bare soles protruding through a
window into the sunlight; and a spiritualis-
tic medium in the same enlightened city
still does a lot of Igood with prescrip-
tions which she obtains when in a state of
trance from a well-known local doctor who
has been dead some years. A practitioner
of Melbourne cures by telepathy, the patient
going “into the silence” in a darkened room
at a stated time every evening, while the
healer projects his beneficent influence
through the air. He has had some striking
successes even as far away as Perth, al-
though, owing to his ignorance of the differ-
ence in time between the two cities, he was
probably asleep in bed when his patients
were keeping the appointment. The success
of these pseudo-scientists is a testimony to
the splendid powers of self-recuperation the
human body owns. It is this mysterious
power which the quack, with his hocus-
pocus apparatus, and the registered prac-
titioner, with his recipes of colored water,
evoke when they “make a cure.” In prose-
cuting blacklegs like Dr. Mackenzie, the
medical trades union may indeed be doing
itself more harm than good. It may set
the general public wondering how much of
tiie expensive machinery of public hygiene
and private practice is hokum too.

The Unmarried Mother..
Rita Cociilan replies to her critics:—
It requires a certain amount of moral courage to
suggest any amendment of present-day laws
and social customs, founded, as they are, on tradi
tiens of the past; so 1 am not surprised to learn,
from the abbreviated remarks of Bulletin corres-
pondents, that my proposals regarding the unmarried
mother meet with general disapproval.
Before I reply to anyone, let me quote an actual
case. A friend of mine, an educated woman of good
social standing, has failed to attract the “marrying
man,” and realises that, for some undefinable reason,
she never will. She commenced to suffer in health,
not seriously, but sufficiently so to induce her to
consult her doctor, who told Her that she would
never enjoy perfect health until she had a child,
and the accuracy of his diagnosis was confirmed by
another doctor in ignorance of the first man’s verdict.
She would dearly love to have a child of her own,
and admits that, but for the social degradation, she
would do her best to induce one of her many male
friends to assist her in gratifying her maternal
longings. This is a clear-cut issue, and I ask why
she should not be permitted to follow her natural
instincts and, at the same time, regain her health?
Morally, she would be a far superior woman, child
and all, than the lady who practises birth-control
rather than self-control.
Both Alice Jackson and “Horlick Maltiius'"
obscure the issue by dragging in the father, although
I distinctly said he was only a means to an end:
and a nameless lady introduces some more irrelevant
matter. 1 did not think it necessary to explain
that, being a sensible man with a perfect knowledge
of his position, the father would realise he was
merely a party to a contract in which his duties
and responsibilities were clearly defined. The ques-
tions of seduction and maintenance have no bearing
on the case. However, as the father and the child
have been wished on me, a few words concerning
them may not be out of place. Alice Jackson’s
opinions and her anxiety as to where the “means
may be procured betray her inexperience. I posi-
tively decline to assist her or anyone else in a
vain search for that modern St. Anthony whose
moral scruples would cause him to hesitate before
undertaking a job the average present-day man
would rush with his ears back, providing lie was
absolved from any financial liability.
There is no reason why the unmarried mother’s
child’s father should not be the same “ideal" parent
as the other chap: in each case, so far as the child
is concerned, it is merely a matter of mental sug-
gestion.
The remarks about “barren unions” only serve to
emphasise the disabilities under which so many
married people labor. In spite of copy-book maxims,
they cannot, unless anb rosa, “try again” elsewhere
and retain their respectability, and no adopted child
can be a satisfactory substitute for the “bone of
my bone and flesh of my flesh” infant. •
“Horlick Malthus” explodes with a loud report
and a tendency to stray from the point and indulge
in personalities. In reply to her first question, 1
tell her in strict confidence that I have been married
nearly 20 years, and am the mother of a family
reared in infancy as Nature intended, and not on
the patent food her pen-name recalls. She appears
to be greatly concerned with the “rights” of the
father. The manner in which the average father
of the unmarried mother’s child shoulders his respon-
sibilities can be ascertained on application to the
numerous professional abortionists, kind ladies desir-
ous of adopting a baby, and homes, State and
otherwise, that exist expressly for the benefit of the
unwanted child.
Had “11. Maltiius” followed her argument regard-
ing the wisdom of Nature to its logical conclusion,
she would have discovered that, had Nature con-
sidered man a sine qua non about a house, she would
have rendered him immune to all the diseases
known to the medical faculty until his family was
self-supporting. I repeat Nature is a wise old lady
— “II. M \lthub” evidently concurs.
It might interest both Alice Jackson and “H.
Maltiius” to learn that of the mentally defective
children at present sheltering in so-called orphanages
in Australia, Britain and the Continent, 90 per cent,
are the product of wedlock. I invite inquiry as
to the accuracy of my statement.
To the author of the “rare confession” I extend
my thanks for her support and express the hope
that, should her daughter later rn decide to marry,
her prospective husband will be man enough to
waive the accident of birth. Her remarks concern-
ing the employment of incompetent women prompt
the reply that the employer who from motives of
economy works his female employees as hard as
he can for the smallest wage he is allowed to pay,
is preferable to the emasculate Brigham Young who
employs them because they appeal to his aesthetic
soul; in other words, who “likes to have them
about him.”
But in spite of the ladylike and courteously expressed
opinions of Alice Jackson, the sound and fury of
*’II. Malthus,” the “rare confession” of the anony-
mous lady, and the limited acquaintance of all three
with human nature and life, the unmarried mother*
being a mother, deserves more protection,
ment and assistance than she at present receives,.
She is evidently on the increase, as on February-
-15 last the Bishop of Tasmania said he “did not
know what marriage in Australia was coming to.
The time might come when ministers would have to
refuse to accept the Government license for marriage,
and tell the Ministry to marry the people itself.
The aim to-day was to facilitate the separation of
married couples, but the Church believed definitely
that marriage was indissoluble. People went to
church and swore before God that they would remain
together whatever happened, and yet they broke
their vows and treated them as scraps of paper.
Viewed from an ethical standpoint, therefore,, the
divorced woman, being “single and unmarried (ns
Jacob Stahl’s first wife described herself), is on
exactly the same social plane as the ‘ unmarried.

A Bridge and Too Much Cackle.
Although the Sydney Harbor bridge is only
in the stage where you can see piles of stones
and stacks of timber and cranes and horses
and carts on either bank, it has been the
occasion for an extraordinary amount of
writing in the press-agent’s vein. Had the
leading characters been moving-picture
actresses they couldn't have been more in-
dustriously boomed. There was one out-
break of adulation when the enabling bill
was passed ; another when the chief engineer,
three assistants and his lady secretary went
to Britain “to consult with the contractors
and check the plans” ; another when the party
returned; and another when one of the con-
tractors arrived in Sydney. And there was
a perfect orgy of back-scratching at the lay-
ing of the foundation-stone, which took place
one day last week in the presence of “2000
invited guests,” for whose comfort acres of
timber had been rigged up. In one of the
admiring journals the chief engineer has been
described as the “greatest bridge authority
in the world,” or words to that effect. He is
indisputably a clever man —his record proves
that —but it is chiefly as a railway-construc-
tion engineer that he is known. lie has cer-
tainly had no experience in building bridges
on the grand scale. Ills design—so far as
it is his design—looks imposing in illustra-
tions, but it will be time enough tor the
tumult and the shouting when flu? structure,
with its tremendous arch, is in being and has
stood all tests. Anyhow, this paper wishes
he wouldn't talk so much to the reporters, or
that those brisk young men would let him
alone for a few years, if only for the reason
that the individual who gets an excessive
amount of “publicity” not infrequently comes
a dreadful thud. As a matter of fact,
things haven't gone altogether smoothly the
little way they have, thus far travelled. For
one thing, the Government has become in-
volved in a libel action arising out of some
remarks on a rejected tender; for another,
the contractors have acquiesced in a claim
for a considerable rise in wages, their agree-
ment, it transpires, specifying that the Gov-
erment must pay any increase resulting from
an award or variation of an award. In
Judge Rolin’s words, the successful tender
was based on “the lowest possible wage-
rates” for a 48-liour week; obviously there
is going to be a succession of claims for
higher rates, and, if the Laborites set in
next month, they will make it a 44-hour
week. So nobody yet knows what the bridge
will cost; and nobody yet knows, either,
whether a tunnel wouldn't have been safer.

Ten Years’ Trial.
The suggestion of Ramsay Macdonai.d dur-
ing the debate on the Protocol, that the idea
would prove all right after 10 years’ use,
brings back memories of a similar sugges-
tion made with more success by Cobden
when the Freetrade scheme was first let
loose. Cobden”s idea was to go in for abso-
lute removal of all Customs duties on every-
thing for 10 years ; and he staked his pro-
phetic guessing-power—whatever that might
be worth—that, at the end of the period,
all the other European nations would have
followed Britain’s lead. In actual practice
the scheme never got a trial. A partial
Freetrade was brought about with great
flourish of trumpets and loud assurances of
the wonders it was going to work; and at
the end of 10 years 110 nation in Europe had
been foolish enough to copy it. But the
10-years period had been sufficient to make
the Freetrade idea close like a steel trap on
the British mind; and no matter what suffer-
ing the nation has since had to put up with,
no one has yet been able to remove the
cause. 111 the light of such a piece of
modern political history the talk about giv-
ing things a 10-years’ trial might well move
people to mirth. The Protocol is far more
dangerous in its way than even the doctrine
of Freetrade; for the fiscal mistake could
be rectified by Parliament at a single ses-
sion, while the other matter is apt to be
invested with a sort of divine right which
might make the removal of its objectionable
clauses only possible by the waging of a
war so terrible that its cause would be en-
tirely forgotten in the universal disaster. To
alter the Constitution of any nation —even
one as young as Australia —is a task; to
alter a world-wide arrangement in such a
way as might seem to be an infringe-
ment of the rights of small nations
would be almost unthinkable. After 10
years’ trial the dangerous clauses would be
just as dangerous as ever; but the thing
would be fixed about the neck of humanity
with bolts and rivets of passion and pre-
judice.
Our Prohibited Uncle Sam.
A familiar figure is the man (sometimes
he is a woman) who went abroad to find
evidence in support of a preconceived
opinion, and found it in his mind’s eye, or
invented it, and who comes back swearing
that the places visited are full of corrobo-
ration, and that there is nothing else in
sight. It doesn’t matter whether he wants
to demonstrate that Communism has made
Russia rich, or that Prohibition has turned
the United States into a golden paradise
where crime is unknown, or that Freetrade
cures everything including a weak back, or
that there are oil deposits at the North
Pole—the result is the same. If the Prodigal
Son had gone forth as a special commissiouer
to write a glowing report of the swine
lie would naturally have returned with a
glowing report of the swine. Still more
people write the glowing report without
going out to inspect the animals at all.
For some time now the press has been
flooded with much loose statement concern-
ing the marvellous advancement, moral and
material, of the drinkless United States,
and there has been a wealth of assertion
accompanied by a gaunt famine in details.
Thus politician Tommy Walker, of West-
ralia, based his narrative solely on the
alleged wonderful progress of Peoria—which
has 76,121 inhabitants, and ranks as No.
91 among Uncle Sam’s cities—since the
distilleries closed. This would have been
skimpy and detached testimony, even if par-
ticulars of the progress had been given;
but they weren’t. Statistics never are, and
THE FISHWIVES.
“'Grrrr — Proddy!” “ Burrrr — Carthlick!"
never can be, up to date; age creeps on them
while the returns are being counted. But
those that follow are the newest available:
The exports of merchandise from the United States
reached £1,589,861,621 in 1919—a vast sum when
put into dollars. In 1923 they were down to less
than half, the figure being £791,416,586. (States-
man's Year Book for 1924, which is the latest issue,
page 4-71.)
The number of persons employed in U.S. manu-
factures was given as 10,543,599 in 1919, and as
only 8,084,511 in 1921. (Same authority.) Some
change in statistical methods may have helped to
explain this, but it is hard to explain the unanimous
drop in the value of the output in the five main
lines of textile industry and 13 lines of metal
industry. A decline from 34,026,979 tons of steel
ingots made in 1919 to 18,864,516 tons in 1921
invites contemplation. It can’t be wholly due to
inward drought; still there it is. It is a pity that
the industrial census isn’t taken annually.
U.S. shipping engaged in foreign trade was about
2,000,000 tons less in 1923 than in 1921. (Same
authority.) This is hardly' an argument. Still it is
an item. And The Bulletin didn’t mention these
things first, anyway.
In 1919, according to Whitaker’s Almanac for
1925, which takes up the parable here and fills a gao,
employers came to the Federal employment bureaus
wanting 10,701,447 workers, and workers came
seeking 5,166,447 employers, so there were 5,535,000
more jobs than job-seekers. In 1922, where the
narrative leaves off, the numbers had fallen below
2,000,000 in both categories, but the job-seekers were
in a majority' of 64,295. About other bureaus no
information is to be found.
In 1919, by the same authority, there were 265,707
miles of railway in full work in the U.S. In 1921,
where the record stops for the present, the number
of miles at work was set down at 262,544. Appa-
rently no new mileage had Deen built, and 3165
miles of line —perhaps used entirely for the carriage
of alcohol—had been closed. Incidentally, it has
just been mentioned that the Chicago-. Milwauke-
e Paul railway system has gone into the hands of
its creditors, after a slump in which the shareholders
lost £100,000,000.
The Statesman's Year Book records that
142,333,125 fewer passengers and 352,467,080 fewer
tons of freight were carried on the United States
railways in 1921, where the chronicle ends for the
present, than in 1919. And it is impossible to
suppose that the 352,467,080 tons of freight which
vanished so suddenly was all drink. There must
have been a general slump of some sort.
This handful of facts is quoted as evidence
that travellers are much given to lying,
and that liars are much given to travelling;
also that plenty of people lie without travel-
ling, and swear fluently about foreign parts
without going there, and without even read-
ing them up in books. Some of them swear
about imaginary parts. It has been said
that the more pious a movement is the more
unscrupulous and unreliable are the men
who run it. On this matter The Bulletin
offers no opinion. The United States being
a backward country in the statistical way,
it is impossible to give any comparative
figures concerning crime and drunkenness,
so on these matters reformers and others
can perform pretty much as they please.
There isn’t much to object to in the preval-
ence of Ananiases except that their accept-
ance leads to the iliabit of vacant land
open-mouthed credulity, and it is a degrad-
ing idiosyncrasy. Australians may not have
it worse than the average, but they have it
a great deal too badly. If they hadn’t, the
Country Party impostors, with their tale
about making the farmer rich by the
use of imported Freetrade ploughs and har-
rows, would be laughed off the map. Tiie
Bulletin doesn’t advocate liquor, but for
the credit of the national intelligence it
advocates some attempt at accuracy in the
people who orate about liquor. To be taken
in by individuals who lack even the rudi-
ments of plausibility is something to De
ashamed of.

“Len” : Vere Herbert Casey, a Melbourne
man who has lived in apparent affluence for
years without having any money to do it on,
got his discharge from bankruptcy the other
day; and this achievement calls attention to
some of those loopholes in the Bankruptcy
law of which the contumacious may avail
themselves. A breach-of-promise verdict was
given against Casey in 1914, and he promptly
went insolvent. Many attempts since then
have been made to shake money out of the
pockets of the bankrupt, but he successfully
resisted them all by declining to earn any
money for himself. He had, it appeared, a
benevolent brother who discharged for him
tailors’ bills, supplied him with motor-cars
when he wanted them and gave him pocket-
money. It was in return for this, of course,
that Casey kept busy—purely in liis brother's
interest—with various enterprises

“Anophele”: The Northern Territory is
not the only place administered by the Com-
monwealth where leprosy lias to be fought;
at Nauru, in the Western Pacific, the
authorities have a tougher problem on their
hands. An official report covering the inves-
tigation or a number of cases of leprosy at
Nauru contains some startling disclosures
and emphasises the folly of the civil adminis-
tration interfering with the Health authori-
hs. The whole of the 35 cases dealt with
in the report are believed to be traceable to
a native woman from Ocean Island named
Jvrsio. During the period that I was on
Ocean Island this woman had a noddin"
acquaintance with most of the staff of the
I acific I hosphate Co., as she was a fluent
linguist. However, none of us suspected
her of any disease; a rather prominent
marking of the face and a missing eye were
said to be due to Etsio having been moon-
struck when younger. She had relatives at
JNauiu, and, having made an application,
was allowed to travel thither on one of the
co. s vessels on which I happened to be. On
reaching the Island the medical officer of
the then German Administration, Dr.
Muller boarded the vessel and made what
appeared to me a very casual inspection lie
gave the half-dozen who were landing at
the island a clean bill of health with tl.e
exception of the woman Etsio, who, I after-
wards gathered, was suspected of leprosy.
He ordered her isolation on the boat until
she could be returned to Ocean Island, some
100 miles away. As the ship had to wait
some time for loading, the skipper protested,
but the M.O. insisted. Finally the captain
appealed to the German Governor of the
island, who over-ruled the medical officer,
llie result of that is that the present admin-
istratmn has some 40 lepers on its hands.

“Narhoda”: Until last week it was a year
or so since I had seen a picture play, and
that was in another ' country where loin-
clothed Asiatics add to their sense of racial
superiority by viewing through Hollywood’s
spectacles the silliness and moral degrada-
tion of their Western overlords. Inspection
confirmed my previous opinion that the
whole contraption of high-salaried manno-
Qums and million-dollar spectacles was rush-
ing down a steep place to the sea. It also
revived hopes that the infant Australian
industry, if it rushes thoughtfully in the
opposite direction, may yet make this great
land of sunshine the home of a real moving
picture art. The prime error, it appears to
me, that the Americans have made, is to
overstep the limitations of their medium;
and the priceless opportunity of Australia’s
industry is to bring that medium back to
its proper uses. Even with the assistance
ot a tariff as high as Koscuisko, Australian
producers cannot hope to compete with the
Laemmles and the Selznicks in the con-
struction and destruction of Assyrian cities to
obtain a momentary effect; but they can, if
they want to, mobilise the dramatic talent
standing unemployed about the playhouses
to create a cheap but genuine and effective
art of _the moving picture. That art is
essentially an art of one dimension. It is
derived from the ancient shadow-show of
Asia and not from the legitimate stage, as
Pauline Frederick has asserted in an
interview. The American producers have
tined to make it move in three dimensions,
and because it would not do it they have
had to resort to the ruinous device of break-
nig the dramatic action wfith printed words
of explanation. It. is this device that has
made all their lavish machinery of paste-
board palaces abortive to produce one single
dramatic moment. Charlie Chaplin, w ; ho
happens to be an Englishman, is one of the
few actors on the screen who understand
the limitations of their art, and a simple bit
of pantomime by him sticks in the mind
when all the costly spectacles have faded
quite away, it is significant that Charlie
seldom resorts to the irritating “legend”:
lie tells his voiceless story by brilliant panto-
mime alone. If this view r of the real nature
of the art is right, Australian picture-makers
would get more instruction from the study of
a Punch-and-.Tudy show r than from all the
elaborate ineffectiveness of “drammer” as
understood in Hollywood.

Gullible Melbourne still continues to dance

forgets, in protesting that the Government
turns off the five-ton ’buses to replace them

POLITICAL
POINTS
From the N.S.W. Gallery:
An explosive feature of the chin-music on the
N.S.W. Marriage Amendment theme was the an-
nouncement of Loxton, K.C., Nationalist member for
Ityde, that he would not vote for the bill unless it
was amended to his liking. Another was Tom Hen-
ley’s anguished “resignation” from the Ministerial
party because, having prepared an oration, he was
denied an opportunity to deliver it. But the atti-
tude of Connell, the A.I.F. major, was more interest-
ing than either of these revolts. Alone among the
Labor Assemblymen, Connell voted for the bill in
its original form. In the Leg. Council the ayes had
a majority of one on the second reading; they
included Tom Storey, brother of the late Labor
Premier of that name, and P. G. Hordern, who was
likewise appointed by the Storey Government. But
the bill seemed destined for radical amendment, if
not defeat, on the third reading when J. A. Browne,
one of the legal members, suggested substituting the
words “truly husband and wife” for “truly and
sufficiently married,” in the clause prescribing a
£lOO fine or 12 months’ imprisonment, or both, for
“every person who alleges, expressly or by implica-
tion, that any persons lawfully married arc not
truly and sufficiently married.” Ley, the bill's
begetter, hurriedly accepted the alteration, and now
each side is claiming a victory. And all that fuss
over a matter of three words!
Stewart, M.11.R. for Wimmora (Vic.),
who says he was pushed out of the Bruce-
Page Ministry because lie objected to that
midnight election agreement, has been giving
his Cookies some advice: —
Eschew all alliances; remain as an independent
force and fight for the principle of elective Ministries.
With this achieved the party can then accept its
quota of portfolios and co-operate with other parties
for the. good government of the country. Which good
government, is impossible under the present system
of Cabinet responsibility.
The advice is sound; indeed, elective Mini-
stries is the only principle for a third party
that doesn’t aim at being a nuisance or a
danger. But believers in elective Ministries
make a poor showing at (’ockv conferences
compared with the group that is for joining
with the Nationalists provided every third
Agrarian member gets a portfolio, and with
the other faction that is for putting Labor
in office and extorting all manner of con-
cessions.
A measure of satisfaction (fully a pint)
can be extracted from new alien immigration
regulations. Before an adult can hope to
get in he must be the- possessor of £4O: and
where the export of surplus population has
been reduced to a system, as in Italy, it is
probable that this amount will be habitu-
ally lent for show purposes by the depart-
ment which runs the business. A friend or
relative here may also guarantee the
stranger’s maintenance, which reads like an-
other version of the way impecunious crimi-
nals bail each other out in Slelbourne, some
breaking out of prison to do it. When all
is said and done, British birth and a good
knowledge of the English language are better
than the possession of £4O, or than the
promissory note of a compatriot who had
previously got in on a note himself. And
British “migrants” are available enough if
the people who run the country would rise
to the occasion.
The present position is that the Common-
wealth is going to import its new ships from
Britain because Britain is cheaper than
Australia, and Britain is ordering ships in
Germany because Germany is cheaper than
Britain. Wherefore it might be logic (though
not commonsense) if Bruce skipped the
intermediate stage, and placed his order in
Germany too. A serious trouble in Britain
is the go-slow. In Australia, where men are
expelled from unions for doing more than the
minimum of work, it is the go-slower. And
Queensland hopes to achieve the go-slowest
in a month or two, when the 44-hour law
comes into force.
What Queensland thinks of the Gillies
Ministry and of the manoeuvres which pre-
ceded its formation will be shown, to some
extent, on Saturday, when the Toowoomba
by-election will lie contested by E. J.
Llewelyn, for Labor and Jimmy Tolmie,
for the Opposition. Llewelyn, son of a for-
mer M.L.A. for Gympie, is superintendent
of the Toowoomba Ambulance Centre. Tolmie,
a school-teacher and then a newspaper man,
ANOTHER DEATH-RED REPENTANCE.
“The Commission inquiring into the question of ex-soldiers’ pensions has decided that pensions should
be increased in cases where severe hardships have been experienced. It explains, however, that delays
were unavoidable in amending cases of injustice.”

was M.L.A. for Drayton and Toowoomba
1901-09. and for Toowoomba 1912-18, as well
as being Secretary for Lands under Digb.v
Denham. Labor has won the seat at three
general elections, hut on those occasions .it
had no Brennan appointment to live down.
One of the reasons advanced by Westralian
politicians why their State should receive
baksheesh is that it humps the burden of
more railway in proportion to its population
than any other community on earth. The
claim should be inspected before payment.
The bleak year for Sta*e railways was 1921.
when all the systems failed to cover interest
and working expenses, and Queensland’s came
near to falling short of working expenses.
But by 1923, where the present figures leave
off. a considerable improvement had set in,
except in Tasmania, and the results com-
pared in this wise :
Losses, 1921. Losses, 1923.
Queensland .. .. £1,581,060 £1,292,556
Westralia .. . . 418,370 62,607
Tasmania .. .. 81,907 196,940
Profits, 1923.
N. S. Wales .. .. 577,032 84,056
S. Australia . . . . 561,304 5,769
Victoria .. .. 441,125 227,422
Total loss .. £3,660,798 £1,234,856
Westralia had not so very much more than
its share of the bad luck, on a population
basis, in 1921, and it had its share of the
recovery of 1922 and 1923, and why it should
reckon itself due for a bonus under this
head is all mystery. Tasmania seems a
much more deserving case.
At a Labor selection-ballot
“Jupp” Gardiner, Donald Grant, the Cockatoo
Island Dunn, J. B. Dooley and J. C. Eldridge,
loathed of P. F. Loughlin, Labor-leader Lang's
deputy, arc to be the N. S. Wales Caucus candidates
for the Senate. But what a farce this selection-
ballot business is when it isn’t a swindle! The
scrutiny revealed that about 1500 ballot-papers—
roughly, 30,000 were counted altogether, and that
many times —were simply numbered from 1 to 11
straight down the list: 11 was the minimum number
to be marked. Four hundred other oppressed wage-
plugs started at the bottom and numbered up the
list to 11. Hundreds picked their first preference
(generally Grant, sometime of the 1.W.W.), and then
ran straight on, being concerned only to make the
No. 1 vote valid. The “pigeon” or “blind’’ vote
worked to the advantage of t; n iidates favored b.v
the alphabet. So Gardiner, Grant and Dunn having
been elected, Bodkin. Dooley, Eldridge and Gibbs
led all the rest, though not in that precise order. As
soon as Bodkin was eliminated, alphabetical prefer-
ences carried a D (Dooley) home in preference, to
an .E (Eldridge). Then, Dooley having succeeded,
the “pigeon” descended to Eldridge rather than to
Gibbs. And it was obvious in thousands of eases
that the voter was confused as to the identity ot
the person to whom he gave No. 1. Grant profited
by being mistaken for Senator .Tack Grant, the
single-taxer, and .f. B. Dooley by being confounded
with ex-Premier Jim Dooley, while AV. F. Bodkin,
aged 21, not only scored a host of No. 1 votes
through being first on the list, but' also thousands
of votes manifestly intended for his father, George
Bodkin, see. of the Railwav AAorkers’ branch of the
A.AV.U.
The S. Ans. Labor Government enlivened
the week-end by intimating, after weeks of
deep thought, that its thousand homes
scheme, on which poor old Joseph Timms
fell down, “has not collapsed, although the
contractor has”; that operations would be
resumed on the day-labor system, and that
it was “hoped to complete the houses at a
cost approximating the contract price of Mr.
Timms.” “In any case,” added Bill Denny,
the humorist of the Cabinet, “the contract
will be completed at Mr. Timms’s risk.”
South Aus. hasn’t done laughing yet.
The Argus is praying her hardest that
the new organ to replace the instrument
burnt in the Melbourne Town Hall may be
imported. The old lady’s argument is typical:
When. Melbourne set about procuring the fine
instrument recently destroyed, her aim was to obtain
the best organ the world could produce. .. .Subse-
quently Sydney, in ordering her city organ, was
V. lo , v ! ed * J - V a laudable spirit of emulation to excel
Melbourne, and bought a finer instrument in England,
i , e Caty Council should be induced to entrust
the building of the new organ to Melbourne builders
with their wholly inadequate resources, then Mel-
bourne will complacently surrender the primacy to
Sydney, and Melbourne music-lovers, and, indeed all
Melbourne citizens, will hang their heads in humilia-
tion.
\ct when Jones, by practising thrift and
other virtues, builds his own little home, the
Annus gives him a cheer. VVhat it obviously
ought to do is to tell him to compare its
modesty with the rented grandeur of the
thriftless, and hang his head in humiliation.
The importation of goods because they are
cheaper than the local article is common
enough, but it is declared in Melbourne that
the two gas-holders which the Metropolitan
Lo. intends to import will cost more than
the price they could be built for at the co.’s
own well-equipped works. As much as £40,000
more, it lias been said. It is assumed that the
transaction, if correctly reported, is based on
some high anti-Australian principle, and that
t'n will be added to the gas
bill. Hie Age declares that its requests for
information were treated with large quanti-
ties of dead silence—a substance to which
that chatty publication never did take kindly.
Incidentally, the Victorian railways, in addi-
tion to buying 18 trucks from Uncle Sam,
sent one order for machines to the U.S., and
another to Czeclio-Slovakia, which possibly
comes of having a Country party faddist as
Brenner.
Civil servants of the old school gasped
when they read how Percy Deane, sec. to
the Priminister’s Department, had talked at
an ad-men’s luncheon in Melbourne on poli-
tics as a hazardous occupation. To them he
seemed to be intruding on a forbidden
domain. But perhaps Deane calculated that
he was safe in posing as champion
and apologist for the “underpaid, much
maligned and greatly misunderstood politi-
cian ; or he might have thought that one
good turn deserves another. Certainly a
young man whose rise in the service has
been phenomenal, and who gets £2OOO a year
for bossing a grandiose office which has no
counterpart even in Britain, has reasons for
being grateful to the gentry alleged to be
sweated, slandered and misunderstood.
The great blank in the fertile Northern
Rivers district of N.S.W. is to continue
a while longer, the proposed railway from
Guyra, on the tableland, to the coast having
been again rejected by the Public Works
Committee. Three out of the four Com-
mittee men who voted against it were unpaid
life members of the Upper House and, like
most of their species, Sydney residents. One
of them has been Upper Housing for 17 years
and another for 18. Possibly they are past
the age for quitting the old groove. It is
a line piece of democratic government, this
allotment of three-sevenths of the power of
veto on new enterprises to honorary and
irremovable fossils.
The Ship Painters and Dockers’ Union
struck a different Judge from “sympathetic
old" Powers when it applied to John Quick
in Melbourne for a new award and improved
conditions while some of its members were
carrying on a brisk strike in Sydney. The
proceedings were brief and not cordial. Tin*
usual plea was advanced that the strikers
were out of hand and wouldn’t obey their
helpless leaders. But when the Fordsdale
men refused to strike, the speed with which
the helpless leaders got the machinery of
retribution and victimisation to work was
marvellous.
The Irishman has a way of his own even
in the North, where he is largely Scotch.
At the elections for the Home Rule Parlia-
ment at Belfast 10 strenuous Unionists were
returned unopposed. Also De Valera, the in-
surrectionary leader, occasional gaol-breaker
and frequent outlaw, came up from the South
as a candidate for the wild humor of the
thing, and he was returned unopposed. It
may be that he will angle for a portfolio.
Ireland has many peculiarities, one of them
being that in the Free State the people, as
a rule, don't speak their own national langu-
age. If too many disturbing and disaffected
Irish “republicans” present themselves in
Australia, this country might work off a
joke: they might be put to the language test
and sent back for ignorance of Irish.

But one requiring guts

But wrongs like these grow pale and dim
Beside the dirt they did to him
W’hcn Henley got the hump.
He’d dredged material, stacks and stn< ks,
From many a ponderous tome
To give tlie Scarlet Woman socks
And swing a punch at Rome.
He’d quires of notes benpath his eye,

Could raise so cruel a lump.

“Gouger”: An Aussie pal in Gallipoli was
passionately fond of a little furze bush
which struggled for life just atop of our
parapet. He built sandbags round its
possy, and watered it every day from his
own scanty ration. And the water ration
was scanty. One morning the plant de-
lighted its benefactor by sporting a little
green bud, which presently blossomed into a
bright scarlet flower. A few days later a
whole bunch of flowers flaunted cheerily
against the hard brown of the parapet. One
day w'hen the soldier was in the support-
trenches the sweating water fatigue trailed
along. The Aussie drew his ration and hur-
ried into the fire-trench to his beloved vege-
table. It was a blistering hot day. I was

“Iford”: Has the Tutankhamen curse
shifted to the law-courts? A couple of years
ago, when Lord Carnarvon, the man princi-
pally responsible for opening up the tomb
of the deceased Pharaoh, was bitten by some
unidentifiable insect and died after a very
brief illness, there was a spirited discussion
in the London press—no less an authority
on the occult than Conan Doyle participat-
ing—on the possible perils of incurring the
wrath of obsolete Egyptian deities by dis-
turbing mummy-dust in the Valley of the
Kings The just-concluded unsavory Dennis-
toun case, in which Lady Carnarvon's second
husband was sued by his former wife—the
lady recovered £5OOO damages and the costs
of the protracted orgie of mud-throwing by
several expensive K.C.’s are placed at ±dO,UUU
more — m ay set impressionable people won-
dering how far the aggrieved guardian spirits
of Tut's tomb are going to carry the ven-
detta and what limits there are to their
powers for evil. Fanciful rubbish, no doubt
and yet queer stories have been told per-
sistently before now about the malign influ-
ences exercised by at least one mummy in
the British Museum on everybody who had
a hand in housing it there. It' anything
untoward should happen to the persons who
are bent on disturbing the 5000 years’ rest of
Snefru, a vastly more remote celebrity than
Tut, this business of rooting in tombs for
relics of the dead past is quite likely to be-
come unpopular even among enthusiastic
Egyptologists.

“A.R.C.”: I suggest with due diffidence
that the very disturbing epidemic of infan-
tile paralysis in Maoriland may be caused
by a plant eaten by cows and affecting
tlleir milk. We know that medicine taken by
a nursing mother very often disturbs the
child. Might not a plant eaten in safety by
cows injuriously affect their milk and there-
fore the children who drink large undiluted
quantities of this fluid? The children of the
slums are given less of it than the children
of the well-to-do, and I imagine that this is
also the case with the Maoris, and we have
the fact that the slums and the Maoris are
scarcely affected by paralysis. There is the
evidence of calves at Auckland being seized
by paralysis, and the report that bees at
Christchurch are also paralysed. Does this
not point to a plant which may in its deadly
effects be working the piischief—a plant
that perhaps grows infrequently or only
under certain climatic conditions? Years ago
I had experience with horses which, when
they grew hot, were seized with paralysis of
the hindouarters, resulting in some cases,
where rest was not immediately given, in
death. Careful inquiry showed that it was
caused by a plant which grew amongst the
lucerne —avoided by the animals in its green
state, but, dried with the lucerne and fed as*
hay, indistinguishable and therefore devoured.
Again, old hands will tell you that “Birds-
ville disease” in horses in the far west of
Queensland is probably caused by a plant
which grows on the sandhills after a. drought
and subsequent heavy rain: the disease is
peculiar to sandhill country and only breaks
out every now and then.

plate. When lie came out he was given a

till the milkman clattered round. A fortnight
after he went in again, this time for stealing
some of the family jewels. Another boister-
ous welcoming greeted his second return ; and

“Macann”: It was our first experience
with a New Guinea reptile, and, being a
bit uncertain, we sought the boss boy s
opinion. He shook off a betel-induced sleep
sufficiently to look slowly from the dead
snake to the punctures on my mate’s ankle,
and pronounced a drowsy judgment. bor-
right,” he said. “You die quick timie.
Then lie went to sleep again.
“T.P.”: “Ex-Dig.” (B. 19/3/’25) on
juvenile war-heroes makes one wonder how
much tragedy was connected with the rush
to the colors by boys with the physique of
men and the brain of children. At Galli-
poli a vigorous 17-year-old, foremost in
sporting contests, went over the top for the
first time. He clashed with a Turk, and,
after some pretty bayonet play, stuck the
enemy through the throat. A chum of mine
yelled “Well done, lad!” The poor boy re-
leased his weapon, stared at the squirming
mass, shrieked “What have I done : and
bolted back to his trench. He will finish
his days in a padded cell.
“Ceuturion” : A week or so ago one Pollitt.
a notorious British “Red,” was forcibly
taken out of the train which was carrying
him to a big communist meeting at Liverpool,
was shoved into a motor-car and whisked oft'
into hiding for 24 hours, when he was re-
leased unharmed. The kidnapping took place
in broad daylight
at Edgeliill station,
just outside Liver-
pool, an important
junction thronged
with officials ami
passengers. Yet not
one individual
seems to have
bothered to inquire
why a yelping and
vociferous indivi-
dual was being
hauled along the
platforms by four
strong-armed and
utterly uncommuni-
cative captors. It
is a curious illus-
tration of English
psychology. Th e
habit of taking
things for granted,
plus a dislike of in-
truding on other
people’s affairs, is
deep rooted in the
Englishman. People
who saw the inci-
dent, including rail-
way officials, said
later that they con-
cluded the man was
a raving lunatic or
a recalcitrant
prisoner, and paid
no attention to his
appeals for help,
though his name,
at least, might
have been expected
to catch the atten-
tion of the railway
employees, militant
unionists to a
man. The affair
leads one to won-
der, too, whether
similar bluffs, with
more serious conse-
quences attached, are not worked occasion-
ally.

“Wanchai”: Inscriptions on Common-
wealth notes (B. 19/3/ : 25) are still common
-—particularly such blithering inanities as
“God send you back to me,” a perpetual re-
minder to wearied bank tellers of the lack
of originality in man. Incidentally, such an
adornment would not induce the Common-
wealth Bank to destroy the note unless it
was otherwise mutilated. “The last shot in
the locker” is an inscription I have seen only
once. The strangest endorsement that ever
came under my notice appeared on a very old
Australian banknote which had been sent
from the Darwin branch of a bank to the
head office. The inscription, barely legible,
ran: “This will be found on the body of a
dead Chow.” And it was.

THE RUBICON.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
“Summer ends, officially, on March 21.”
The sky is blue and the sun is bright;
But we, by the calendar advised,
Know that this glory and warmth and light
Are phenomena quite unauthorised;
The perspiration and drouth that erst
We felt are things no longer normal,
And sunburn, after the twenty-first,
Must be regarded as quite informal.
Should the sagging butter commence to melt,
Show it the calendar, point out clearly
The time is over when heat is felt,
Its warmth is imagination merely ;
And lest some similar fancy call
Milk and meat to behave their worst,
Be sure and write on the pantry wall:
“Summer ceased on the twenty-first.”
It’s over, yes; yet the sun is hot
And around me a large mosquito capers—
It’s most annoying that such a lot
Of things created won’t read the papers !
Avaunt with your fierce, incessant thirst,
And your whining song, insatiate rover 1
Saturday week was the twenty-first—
Don’t you know that the summer is over?

“Lady, refined, no opportunities, like meet respect-
able gentleman” .... —Argus.
Tragic my theme and sober, slow my metre
To fit the heavy-footed harmonies
Of some tear-sodden dirge. ’Twere surely sweeter
So to disclose a lone soul’s agonies.
All sorrow in two words! Could phrase be feater ?
“No opportunities 1”
And yet a thought—suppressed, no doubt, it should
be—
Comes like a dancing, sunlit mote to tease
The gloom my sombre muse imagined would be
Most fitting. Soft it whispers, “Tell us, please,
Just how much less refined the lady could be
With opportunities 1”

Sixenate”: A curious charge of theft was
that recently lodged against a Melbourne
litigant who grabbed a letter lying on a
solicitor’s table and destroyed it. The docu-
ment was alleged to be valuable evidence in
a claim for commission, and the solicitor
naturally felt aggrieved—hence the charge
of stealing “a sheet of paper valued at three-
pence.” The P.M. thought that as there was
no intrinsic value in the document that had
been grabbed and it had not been converted
to the grabber’s use—it had simply been
torn up and thrown out of the window—
there could be no conviction; but the honora-
ries differed, and the offender finally took the
easiest way out by pleading guilty and elect-
ing to be dealt with summarily. A fine was
inflicted, leaving a still unsettled point
whether a man who destroys a valuable docu-
ment belonging to someone else is legally
a thief —unsettled, anyway, as far as the
higher Courts are concerned.

“Centurion”: A queer instance of the per-
sistence of ancient superstitions comes from
Newcastle (N.S.W.). Some workmen mak-
ing excavations discovered a plant of old
copper coins and sixpenny bits dated as far
back as 1780. One of the workmen took
home a few farthings as curios, but his
wife refused to have anything to do with
them, saying they would inevitably bring
bad luck, and they were thrown away. This
is a direct survival of the old English belief
that the ancient burial mounds and “bar-
LISTENING IN. — U.S.A. SPEAKING!
rows” were the strongholds of the Fairies,
and that the coins and ornaments often
found in them were “fairy money,” bringing
evil and disaster to the mortal who appro-
priated them. . Similarly in Britain and
even in Australia there is a common super-
stition that green is an “unlucky” color.
I hat is because it was the Fairies’ color,
and the Little People never failed to visit
their wrath on those assuming their livery.
THE TWO-PIECE LOVER.
“Poor Nanette! Your idol had feet of clay, after all.”
“ Feet? Why, he was clay up to the ncck —and then wood.”
“Myall”: I have read many paragraphs
about Cobb and Co.’s last horse coach,
but not one about its final job. The sub-
stituted motor vehicle was duly loaded and
started for Surat; half-way heavy rain came
on and the car bogged hard and fast. The
old coach had to be re-commissioned for the
rescue; solid as ever, the horses pulled the
mails and passengers through. This is the
final effort, however, as the coach is now
in Brisbane en route to the Commonwealth
Museum.

“Swanston Street”; Another Melbourne
citizen who, when he needs an alcoholiday,
finds it in a mythi-
cal fishing excur-
sion—his wife re-
gards the pastime
as so health giving
that she makes no
objection to the
atmosphere of
whisky he brings
home with him—
has thudded hard
by a slip on the
banana- skin of
over-confidence. As
usual, he went for
supper with some
congenial spirits,
but when he asked
the waiter to “put
the usual parcel of
fish in my bag” he
failed to notice
that the servitor
was not the mau
who generally looked
after him and who
knew his habits.
The first hint that
all was not well
came when his wife
said to him, in a
voice sugary but
very cold: “It was
good of you to have
your fish cooked
before you brought
them home; but
where did you get
the potatoes to go
with them?” Now
his only idea about
those “chips” is
that they were a
kindly, if embar-
rassing, thought of
a waiter who had been well tipped.

“Harold Hardupp”: The Italian who
carries a well-nursed revenge through a wil-
derness of years crops up in real life as well
as fiction. Witness the cable about the
Dago who returned to Lugano after 28
years’ residence in Sydney, and put a bullet
into the prosperous brother who had robbed
him of his inheritance and his sweetheart.
Subsequently ho explained that his ven-
geance had to wait 28 years while he earned
the money to pay his passage home. There
used to be an Italian in the wine-bar at-
tached to a George-street (Sydney) fruit-
shop with a very similar but even more
colorful yarn. Until six o’clock closing
came he would tell the tale, during late
hours, with flashing eyes, to customers’
sympathetic enough to shout for him, and
it was regarded as rather a good joke; after-
wards lie became more taciturn. It is at
least possible that this is the Lugano person.
But one can’t tell. There are many
Italians about Sydney who only want to be
wound up to give out a yarn about the re-
venge they intend to take upon someone
some day ; it seems natural for a Latin to
boil some venom like that in his soul.

“Bay Webb”: The derelict had pleaded
hard for a pint, and Bung was a little
touched by the poor devil’s obvious need.
Seeing the publican waver the wayfarer was
quick to press his advantage. “Just one
pint, and I’ll tell you something worth know-
ing. I’ve tried it myself, and it’s worth a
cask.” When jthe beer had vanished
swaggie wiped his lips and proceeded to dis-
charge his side of the contract: “If ever you
should get six months on the treadmill, boss,
choose next the wall. By leaning a shoul-
der, the job comes easier.”

“Akran”: With a decent cheque Darky
left the Richmond for a jaunt in the city.
After a brief absence he returned, having
tramped all the way, both going and coming,
with Matilda up. Flinging her on the
verandah of the only pub he was quickly
surrounded by the occupants of the “bum-
mers’ seat.” “Had a good time, Darky?”
inquired one. “Cripes, that I did,” replied
Darky. “I’d a drink at every pub goin’ down,
and at every waterhole cornin’ back.”

“Amyl” introduces Hobby :
Some years before the war Hobby commanded a
crack R.H.A. battery in India. He had wealth,
social position and the friendship of the nabobs.
Subalterns looked up to him and prayed that they
might become like him. Horses, ladies and the cup
that cheers, however, made such a hole in his
finances that he was tempted to retrieve his for-
tunes by backing a dead cert with the mess funds.
He was cashiered.
In due course he arrived in Australia, his sole pos-
sessions the clothes he stood up in and a discriminat-
ing taste in liquor. His first job was sweeping out
the Melbourne markets, his next laying wood blocks
on the St. Kilda-road. It was while he was thus
engaged that one sparkling day the Garrison Artil-
lery marched past. The band and the uniforms stirred
something in the depths of Hobby and he enlisted
as a gunner.
Time passed and when the R.G.A. was acting as a
guard of honor to Lord Dudley at the opening of
Parliament in Melbourne it was noticed that the
A.D.C., Captain Ruthven, was paying undue atten-
tion to Hobby. Next day he received an invitation
to dinner at Government House. The Dudleys had
been his intimates and Ruthvcn one of his subalterns
in India. After this he was a frequent visitor,
and eventually his friends persuaded him to sit for
his exam, as a Sergeant-Major on the Instructional
Staff. Needless to say he passed it on his head.
That was the job he was holding when the un-
pleasantness of 1914 broke out. He left Australia
with the A.I.F. as a Battery Sergeant-Major. Pro-
motion duly came his way, and when the Corps
Artillery School was established at Beaueourt, Hobby
was sent there as an instructional officer. He
appeared on quite intimate terms with Birdy and
other brass hats who had been his contemporaries in
India, and he told me that while on leave in London
he had met an old pal who had put his case before
George Rex. Hobby was assured that after the war he
would be reinstated in his old rank in the Indian
Army.
The exigencies of the service moved me else-
where and I lost sight of Hobby, but I often
thought of his past and the light that burned in
his eye when he spoke of his future. About the
middle of 1919 I met the General Officer who had
been Commandant of the Corps Artillery School,
and of course I asked him about Hobby. There was
not much to tell. In the early hours of a winter’s
morning in ’lB some of the officers of the School
were awakened by a crash of glass, followed by a
thud. Hobby, walking in his sleep, had fallen through
his bedroom window and been killed on the cobbles
below.

“Keranavura”: Sid. Cross, foreman of the
timber getters who have just invaded Vani-
koro, one of the Santa Cruz group, has made
a find that should interest delvers in the
early history of the Pacific. It is a silver
coin of Chas. V. of Spain, dated 1778. This
must surely be a relic of La Perouse, the
French navigator who visited the island
twice, eventually losing his ship there. The
coin is about the size of a dollar, and excep-
tionally well preserved. It was found near
the surface at a spot which local tradition
alleges to have been La Perouse’s camping
ground.
* * * *
“Venn”: The 20,000 Cunard liner Car-
thinia, which has been chartered to take a
party of American tourists on a joyage
round the globe, is scheduled to reach Auck-
land in December next. One day is allowed
for Auckland and Wellington, during which
time the passengers “will make inland visits
to study the unusual flora and fauna and
scenic wonders.” If the crowd that gaily
disembarks at Auckland manages to con-
nect with the ship at Wellington in the
specified time it will have put up a
record, and the study will have to be
mostly done from flying train windows. The
number of tourists is limited to 400, and a
joyful item is the assurance that they will
be “grouped socially.” Also, the prospectus
adds gravely, “the tour will include the jour-
ney from Fremantle to Perth” ! It looks as
though there’s going to be some tremendous
inland touring on this trip.

“G.E.C.”: Should the driver of a tram
or train in a collision jump before the crash,
and take the chance of life, or should he
stick to his post until the last? Two recent
cases revive this old question. The driver
of a tram in a. Melbourne collision jumped,
and thereby escaped being crushed to death,
but the driver and fireman of a train in a
South African railway disaster lost their
lives, “scorning to jump clear.” There was
a similar case in Sydney last year, when the
conductor of a runaway McMahon’s Point
tram w’orked at his brakes until the last
moment, and _ was badly crushed in the
smash. In this case the conductor’s efforts
SO THAT’S THAT.
LITTLE BIGGSs (after the first dance): “May
I have the last dance with you?”
MISS HIGGS (quite bored): “You’ve had it.”
probably helped to avert a much worse disas-
ter ; but unless there is some such reason
for remaining, it seems to be largely a mat-
ter of false sentiment when a driver goes to
his death with his train. Of course, if he
has been criminally negligent, his action is
intelligible enough, and the manner of his
death will seem some atonement for his
fault. Otherwise it is no more than a survival
of the out-of-date heroism of the captain of
a vessel, lost through no fault of his own
who insists on going down with his ship
when boats are waiting to take him off.
ADDRESS BY A WEALTHY WIDOW TO HER
ONLY SON, WHO WISHES TO TOUR EUROPE.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
As you know, I hate to cavil
And to spoil your joy and fun,
But you really must not travel
Over Europe now, my son.
In the press they’ve made a feature
Of the news that’s going round
That a prehistoric creature
In Geneva has been found.
\\hat sit called? Just wait a minute
While I stir my mind a bit;
There’s a pro or something in it
Ah, the protocol, that’s it.
What, you’ve never read it? Willie 1
Why, this is a shocking state!
Oh, I think it is so silly
Not to keep right up to date.
Though I hate to spoil your pleasure,
It is for your good, you know ;
You’re my darling and my treasure,
And I cannot let you go.
Why, the protocol might catch you
In some lonely mountain cleft;
With his jaws he would despatch you,
And I’d be bereft—bereft!

Income goes up by almost half a million in
one step. But the achievement won’t make
any stir, for the Australian public has got
used to its greatest insurance society doing
big things. The A.M.P. has the wisdom of
age—this is its 76th annual report —with the
activity of youth. Its progress in this cen-
tury lias been a procession from record to
record. It took over nine years to add a
million to the 1900 income figures; and it
then took to 1915 to add another million.
Last year’s total income was almost 2| mil-
lions greater than that of 1915 and almost
three times greater than it was m 1900.
Business written in Maoriland for the 12
months was relatively greater than in any
of the Commonwealth States; but the expan-
sion was general. This was the position at

Those figures represent total policies in force,
Ordinary and Industrial.
A view of the nit result of last year’s
activity is visible in this statement of new
business and of the business discontinued
through various causes (claims, lapses, etc.) :
12 Months to Dec., Annual

Discontinued .. 38,672 6,356,088 246,091
Year’s gain . . 40,396 £10,288,088 £341,486
When actuary Elliott had finished his valua-
tion of the liabilities under policies lie
showed a surplus of funds of £2,255,931 m
the Ordinary branch, and £146,300 in the
Industrial. He recommended that £2,200,931
of the Ordinary surplus be divided among
participating policy-holders (this will provide
about £3,800,000 of reversionary bonuses)
and that the whole Industrial surplus be dis-
tributed. With £22,855 interim bonuses paid
during the year the increase in the Ordinary
branch over 1923 amounts to £236,497—0nce
more “the largest sum ever distributed by
the society.” For £2,370,086 to go to policy-
holders in one year is one of the many rea-
sons why the path of the A.M.P. agent is
made easy in policy-writing, despite the
aggressive campaigning of the numerous
younger cos. in the field, many of which are
almost regardless of cost in their hunt for
business. The record bonus distribution
amounted to more than half of the premiums
contributed under the participating policies
for the period. This is how the ratio has
expanded since the setback in the worst
war year, with some earlier comparisons:

1916 .. 30.1 „ I 1924.. .. 52.9 ~
Last year £125,194 was taken in cash, but
more than 90 p.c. was used wisely m the
purchase of additional assurance.
The amount available for bonuses at the
end of the current term should notch another
record if last year’s expense rate and inter-
est earnings are maintained. Both moved
the right way.

Of course the bonuses are all round splendid.
But it is not enough for the policy-holder
to merely smile and pocket them. There is
really something very bitter in them as well
as much that is sweet. Those large gains
in interest earnings mean that £lOO isn t
worth nearly as much as it was a few years
ago. The general increase in the expense
rate during the past 10 years points to the
same thing. This means that a man who
was fairly insured if lie carried £5OOO
10 or 15 years ago is under-insured now.
The bonuses are doing their best to restore
the balance; but they can’t do it in the time
that is ahead of most of us. Big bonuses
are therefore a warning as well as a joy.
That a good many people realise this is plain
from the comparative ease with which this
office is getting new business or larger cover.

A collateral explanation of the reduction in
costs is that the activity of the younger
cos. is serving to advertise the value of assur-
ance, and, incidentally, sending new business
along to the old ollices. It is likely, too,
that some insurers who allow their policies
in new cos. to lapse later take up assurance
in the established societies. The figures in
the last column are calculated on the arbi-
trary basis of allowing 7 p.c. on renewal
premiums as the charge for old business and
debiting the balance of expenses against new
premiums.

Expansion in manufacturing and the pur-
chase of city blocks in Perth and Adelaide
for showrooms have necessitated a call for
capital, and shareholders are being offered
at par one for every three ordinaries held
by them on March 21. There were 328,270
ordinaries on the register at Jan. 31. and
as there are buyers in the market at 28s. 6d.
it. is unlikely that any of the issue of
110,036 will be left standing. Ten shillings
covers application and allotment; the rest
will be called up when the Board wants it.
This will lift capital immediately to
£483,294. In 1918 capital was £164,133,
and the trebling is a fair indication of the
firm’s growth over the past seven years.
The co. has deserved all the strength that
has come to it, and the shareholders theu'
run of 10 p.c. divs. Formed in Adelaide
in 1908, for years the co. was busy making
fuel stoves and windmills. The war gave it
that adequate Protection which the Federal
Parliament has not even now given, and a
very capable Board made the best of its
chances. Having purchased the Foreman
Foundry and Enamelling Co., of Hobart,
this part of the business was shifted to Syd-
ney, and the co. set out in earnest to cap-
ture the Australian market for enamel-ware.
It has added line after line, and enamelled
hollow-ware and aluminium ware, with gas
stoves, enamel baths and light-castings of all
kinds, are now produced on a large scale.
Much of the present strength is due to the
Board’s restriction of divs. in earlier years.
In 1912 and ’l3 10 p.c. divs. were paid, but
in 1914 there was no div.; and when
rapidly increasing turnover resulted in good
profits in the war years, the Board kept
the rate down, writing off with a free hand
and sending big sums to reserves. Share-
holders got their reward in 1919 in the shape
of a one in five bonus issue, when some of
the profits they had denied themselves were
pocketed in a lump. At the 1924 mooting
nominal capital was increased from £400,000
to a million. During the year 50,000 profs,
(the prefs. are 7 p.c. cum.) were issued,
making £lOO,OOO of the authorised quarter
million, while ordinary capital moved from
£284,125 to £328,276, although most of the
increase consisted of the 15s. each on
50.000 shares called up during the term.
The profit disclosed was not only a record
but it was £16,637 greater than the record
of the previous year, the increase being
equal to 5 p.c. on ordinaries. The profits
in the introductory table are not net. de-
preciation being included and then shown
senaratelv. In 1924 pref. divs. called for
£3500. Last year they took £4666 (£50,000
were issued in .Tune), so that profits, after
providing for prefs. and depreciation, were
equal to almost 20 p.c. on ordinary capital.
But the Board kept the div. at 10 p.c. and
took the opportunity to write the whole ot
goodwill (£29.656) out of the books where
it had remained unaltered from the be-
ginning. This operation doesn’t figure in
the table at tlic head of these remarks, the
amount having been disregarded from the
beginning. After the final appropriations
visible reserves were £84,608; and certain
contingencies are also provided for other-
wise.
Here is the progress so far as figures
can show it: —

More than liajf the capital is in land and
buildings • so the co. has had to lean pretty
heavily on the banks. Ordinarily one might
doubt' whether it was wise for a compara-
tively young co., , fighting hard for trade
against oversea competitors, to put. so much
money into such assets; but in this case it
hasn’t affected the co.’s expansion-
capital required for the business lias always
been available. It is not much of a secret
that emissaries from London lately arrived
with large quantities of capital* for which
thev sought pref. share investments; and
this co. was on the list of those about whom
inquiries had been satisfactory. The almost
astonishing thing is that the co. can show
such a profit as it does with so large a
proportion of its capital in city and sub-
urban freeholdsI—some 1 —some of them certainly
worth far more than their, book, value.
Apart from all this the position is quite
comfortable: —
1914. 1924. 1925.
Liquid assets .. .. £128.095 £249.963 £317.905

Linuid surplus .. £61,966 £137,415 £150,919
Fixed assets . . .. 99,319 277,551 396,750
And the outlook is bright. More and more
the Australian is realising that if he is to
continue enjoying good conditions for him-
self. he must support the local industries of
others. So the goods made by Metters and
other manufacturing cos. are finding a
steadily expanding market;. and the more
they expand the easier it is for them to
expand still further. The 10 p.c. div. is a
simple matter judging by last years results.
But reserves of £84,607 are not over-large
in relation to capital, which will be well
beyond the half million when the present
issue of ordinaries has been subscribed; cer-
tainly they cannot bear early invasion for
further gift purposes unless the internal
reserves are of quite exceptional volume.

Rumors of an agreement between the co.
and Brisbane Tramway Trust whereby the
latter would draw a supply of power from
the co. for a number of years and then take
over the whole business made the scrip firm
on Brisbane Exchange last month. Whether
anything will develop out of the recent con-
ference between the two bodies re-
mains to be seen. The Trust has been think-
ing over a new power-house, to cost a halt-
million. But the plant of City Electric is
extensive enough to supply the needs both ot
the Trust and of its own consumers, so the
parties met and talked over the matter.
On the other hand, some people advocate
the immediate purchase of the City Electric
undertaking. This vague agitation has, how-
ever, not got far, and the severe setback re-
ceived by Labor in the Greater Brisbane
elections will have its influence against
acquisition. Furthermore, acquisition at this
stage would be loaded with goodwill, ihe
present co. took over the Brisbane Electric
Supply Co. in 1906, paying £35 258 for good-
will. Its franchise expires in 1940. In that
year Brisbane City Council may take it over
011 paying a reasonable sum for everything
but goodwill. Or, if the right is not exercised
in that year, it may be at 10-yearly inter-
vals. It is most unlikely that the Board
would recommend shareholders to surrender
their rights before the expiration of the fran-
chise without a substantial consideration ror
goodwill, because the co. is in a thoroughly
sound position and the 10 p.c. div. on ordi-
naries is a simple proposition. I’ urther, a
co. which has made such rapid progress as
this one isn’t likely to under-value its pros-
pects. Various movements are shown in the
next table: —

At Jan. 31 there were net tangibles with a
book value of £1,277,801. Adding goodwill
and whatever might come to light on a re-
valuation of assets, it is pretty plain that it
Greater Brisbane or the Tramway trust
decides on immediate acquisition it will need
to dredge up about two millions from some-
where. . . • •
Meantime shareholders have no reason to
be disturbed. As at Jan. 31 there was suf-
ficient cash on hand after final _d.iv. appro-
priations to almost cover all liabilities, leav-
ing the book debts (£44,899) and fixed assets
(£1,235,939) to provide £8 16s. 6d. security
for each £1 pref. share, or 225. 9d. for each
£1 of capital. Although capital increased
£12,490 during the year, expansion of service
was such as to make the co. go to its tankers
for £17,934 while liquids declined by ±4<b4.
Fixed assets moved to £1,235,939, an increase
of £85,039. Reserves in the introductory
table consist of renewals, replacement and
contingencies fund £179,624, div. equalisation
fund £3OOO. franchise-purchase sinking fund
£30,400 and unappropriated balance of £l7.
less the intangible Purchase Account, £62,721.
The franchise-purchase sinking fund looks
like an ordinary reserve, and the amount
added to it might just as well be written
off Purchase Account each year. Capital
increased during the year by £12,490; the
smaller total of the div. was due to the last
amendment of the Federal Income-tax law.

i rinded from £47,519 to £55,503 and furni-
ture etc., from £230 to £440, so apparently
all improvments and additions have bee
charged to capital. If so, a property main-
tenance reserve is not a true reserve and has
not been so treated in the table. Tublic
securities, book debts and cash amounted to
£lO 092. Allowing for sundry creditors ana
the div., 13 p.c. of the capital was liquid, the
remainder being represented by the building.
Capital has moved from £35,194 to £03,000,
210,000 £1 shares have been subscribed and
are paid to 6s. each. The security for trusts
is, therefore, strengthened by shareholders
liability for £147,000.

National Portland Cement, striking a dull
spell in public and private spending, got
through its first six months’ work with ii
profit of £967. Things really were better
than that, for over £9OOO was written oft for
depreciation. That interest ot £-<B4 had 1
be found for the banker presumes a so ul
wad of an overdraft. Output got up to 17,367
tons uncruslied cement, and nearly 16,u
tons of finished product was sold. 11ns tor
a start is fair going, as men had to be trained
to sort the material broken in the big faces
to the best advantage. But even it the
extreme production of the present unit ot
40,000 tons be reached, there doesn t seem
to be much profit on the big capital em-
ployed. To get anything decent another unit
will have to be installed to double the output.
Relatively the cost will be low, and London
is being'asked to come in, probably on a
debenture footing.

A co. has been formed in Melbourne with
a capital of £120.000 to develop the Golden
Dyke, Grove Hill. 100 miles from Darwin
(N.T.). P. Martin, the promoter, says the
locality was worked for alluvial down to
10ft. for six miles, which would place it
on the same level as the Sebastopol lead at
Ballarat, the Woolshed lead at E dorado
(Vic.) and the Long aud Golden gullies at
Bendigo. One thousand tons of ore from an
open cut returned 6dwt. free gold and sdwt.
from the sand. A shaft was sunk to luutt.
in the dyke, and a crosscut driven 60ft. on a
width of 20ft. Sampling and assaying from
these workings by the N.T. Mines Depart-
ment gave 15fiwt. It is estimated that there
are 160,000 tons of ore available for mining.
These results, bearing Territory conditions m
mind, do not seem to justify a capital ot
£120,000.
* * * *
The Ajax North (Vic.) is still carrying
on for the benefit of the horny-handed. Its
tally so far is capital paid £28,870, and gold
and pyrites wOn £lBB,lOO. Return in divs.
*23,625, wages bill £116.65n. and timber,
plant, material and fuel £60,500. Directors
fees for all the years the co. has been going
tot up to only £1338. The fat men of the co.
must have lived on the market and not on
divs. or pickings. L. Hansen contrives to
keep so close to profits that he is still allowed
to run the stampers. Most w.ork is at No. (
and No. 9 levels, where he has done a sur-
prising lot of poking about for 4650 tons ot
ore which in the end gave only 185boz. Now
he is linking up with No. 7 intermediate so
that he can drive north into the best zone ot
the mine. The testing of the flat make oft
McMillan’s reef is going on. Most important
of all, he is about to follow the new reet,
picked up east from No. 9 level, into the
slates lying underfoot. To get into them is
the aim of every Daylesford miner, and odds
are taken locally that Hansen will run into
a pay shoot when he makes them. Such
chances keep life in Daylesford mining.

Bright Hope, an Adelaide weakling, has
acquired a forlorn-hope option in the Mistle-
toe leases at Meekatliarra. For a time this
show was in the limelight with a few rich
returns, but development work done by the
late option-holder—the Edna May Central
—showed that they were not backed by any-
thing substantial.

Kanowna Red Hill (W.A.) lately added
a little more to its bank balance and now
has about £4OOO in hand. Gold winnings
have not been as good as formerly,
but sweeteners in the shape of rich veins
are expected to be opened up at any time.
At the start capital was insufficient to open
up the patchy ore bodies and break enough
to keep the mill going. Now that finances
have become easier the co. should carry on
profitably for years and pay occasional divs.
Bullfinch Co. (W.A.) is spending lavislilv on
unwatering the Sand Queen-Gladsome mines
at Comet Vale. The shaft has been drained
on several occasions to rush' ''of sand

Naturally the owners think Radio Deeps,

In addition, prospects of getting the eontmuaUon of
the rich Radio lode on the underlay have been
ported on favorably. The Hansel Mundy Co. has a
free working option over the mine Joi inonths
with the right to complete same at £5OOO ea
and 10 p.e. share interest; and if the proposed bores
strike the Radio lode in the Deeps Hansel Mundj
shareholders will be on a good wicket. #

After much variation downwards m values

Development of the Nightflower
lead lode, Chillagoe (N.Q.), has been ham-
pered during the past month by floods in
the Walsh River. The owners of , the Ar-
gentum, in order to conserve their small
cash reserves, changed their minds about
sinking to 150 ft.. and are crosscutting at
120 ft. instead. The main lode has not yet
been cut at this depth, but the last few
feet travelled have cut a 4in. vein of clean
galena, and is in altered country impreg-
nated with sulphides. Which suggests that
crosscutting on both sides of the mam lode
should be worth while. News of the [ if
cut through the ore body is due now, and
the results are promising the co. will
probably try to mop up the adjoining small
holdings on the line. # »
The Wild Irishman. Herberton (N.Q.R
had a recent crushing of 134 tons for 1° Hu s
4cwt. of concentrates, valued at £l5BO, av
aging £l2 10s. a ton. This old resuscitation
lias been doing exceptionally well lately, an
a big percentage of crushing returns are. go-
ing in further development and prospecting.
A crosscut has been started from the 120 ft
level to test for parallel formations, and has
already at a few feet in cut a new spur
lode carrying colors of tin.
The washing away of the Burdekin Bridge
has paralysed the Bowen River coalfield («.)
for the time being, and unemployment doles
are being handed round. Nearly all Lowtn
coal goes to Townsville for bunkers and
railways, and until the rails cross the Bui-
dekin again far-north Q. is dependent on
Mt Mulligan, which is incapable of keeping
the’ Chillagoe smelters supplied as well as
the Far North down to Townsville and Ayr.

A new silver-lead lode has been located
on the Etheridge field (NQ.), six miles
west of Durham, and a small local rush saw
eight leases pegged out. The new line called
the Silveridge, has been traced for half a
mile so far, and makes up to 6ft. wide of
lead-stained lode formation. Six months
work will probably show whether it is a
souib or not; but among the dozens of shows
recently opened on this field at least one
good mine may be produced.
As Hampden-Cloncurry (Q.) still needs
a better price for copper or lower wage
costs, work at its mines is down to pump-
in •. Nothing very fresh is told about the
Mt Elliott fusion save that London has the
draft agreement before it. So-called liquid
assets have slipped down to £58.267, but
£.lf, 909 is in stores, fluxes and fuel, which
might not pan out at that figure on sale.
Very different is the bank O.D. of £41,190.
Still, the financial position is sound enough,
1,,.;,,,, largely helped bv the co.’s holdins' of
78,715 shares in Metal Manufactures. Pro-
fits flow so solidly to that concern that its
discreet Board has taken the co. out of the
limited liability group, where accounts have
to he shown, and put it into the ranks ot the
proprietary concerns, which can disnense
with that little formality. Collins House
shortlv should let out the exact terms of the
Hampden’s deal with Mt. Elliott. The next
move, anyway, will be an issue of prefs. Fre-
sent shareholders will have the first cut at
the new scrip, and before subscribing will he
given the programme ahead. As the co. is to
be Australian they can insist on being told
a lot more than is usual when London has
the reins. Hampden netted £6596 for the
last six months only because Metal Manu-
factures contributed the best part of £14,480.
Tingha Tin is wrestling with cutter-dredge
troubles. These began when it was found
that the Swintex cutter, an American device,
wouldn’t stand up to the Tingha gravel. So
the Castlemaine Thompsons slapped in a re-
volving cutter. This has worked well in
harbor dredging, but found Tingha faces too
tough. The blades were accordingly replaced
by teeth. This arrangement is a 100 per
cent, improvement, but whether it completely
solves the problem will be found out only
when full power is available. Mauager I-.
Grey Wilson washed up £10,703 of tin in six
months’ run and got within coo-ee of a profit.
What is most to the point is (1) he holds
that a bucket dredge would have fared as
badly as the cutter type of plant, and (2)
the alterations have established the sound-
ness of the cutter principle. Someone has to
pioneer, and it was a bit lucky that the
Tingha had two portable plants to assist in
building up yields. The market pneefor tin
did the rest. The co. owes about £5700, but
assets arc strong enough to withstand a lot
more strain while Wilson is justifying his
optimism. # #
Crown (N.S.W.) put through the 40 tons
spoken of (B. 26/3/25) for a yield of lOoz.
Apparently even handpicked stuff has de-
generated to sdwt.

At FJagstone Tin (N.S.W.) acting-
manager Collins has made way for C. lv.
Mackenzie, late of Vimy Ridge. The lode
has been picked up 4ft. south of the shaft
in a cut into the cliff face, 10ft. of ore
showing with only one wall exposed. I welve
tons broken here vanned 5 p.c. oxide, and
20 tons soon to be crushed at a battery six
miles away should give a ton of oxide on
Collins’s estimate. A bigger lode on top ot
the mountain has been shot into and p.c.
values vanned from it. Generally the pros-
pects of this development co. have improved.
* * * *
Preolenna Coal Co. (Tas.) lias suspended
coal-mining and gone into timber-getting.
A sawmill with a capacity of -6-000
super, feet a week has been installed to
handle beech timber, easily sold at payable
prices. The co. is now just paying its way,
as the full output of the mill gives £75 a
week profit. It is proposed to sell 6795
forfeited shares, or borrow £4OOO. ihc
real job, however, which must be taken up
some dav, is the treatment of Preolenna coal
and oil shale. Given a retort, able to recover
the valuable content^-of the rich oil shales
and coal, Preolenna would come into its
own. # ,
From Gilbert Wilkinson, manager of Misi-
ma (Papua) :
I read with interest “Old Hand's” comment (B.
22/l/’25). To date my co. has treated by cyanida-
tion 5050 tons of ore. The stuff is trucked direct to
vats without any preliminary reduction. Possibly
20 p.c. of lode matter —which Block 10 would have
milled —is left behind. Our extraction has averaged
28s. 6d. per ton of ore treated. We started where
Block 10 stopped, and are breaking ore from 25 to
30 different faces. Our residues will average £1
per ton, making average value of ore before treat-
ment 48s. 6d. Block 10’s last published report
gave average head value of ore as only 285., 01
£1 per ton below our average. Can “Old Hand ’
explain this big difference? As only six whites
(including myself) are employed, and less than 50
natives, including truckers, January tonnage of 890
and February of 865 indicates that we have very little
time for picking ore or leaving much lode behind.
At a meeting held February 21 the directors placed
£5OO at fixed deposit, and declared a shilling div.
payable April 2. and monthly divs. onward until
further notice. There was also an all-round increase
of wages. Mint returns to hand show gold in bul-
lion 3 parts to 1 of silver, or the reverse of what
“Old Hand” found Them. Our bullion, after reduc-
ing zincs with sulphuric acid only, has averaged
from £2 2s. to £2 6s. per oz.
Lack of funds can hardly be quoted as a cause
of Block 10’s failure, as called-up capital was
£400,000 and gold won over £130,000. Our
up capital is only £2950. In my opinion under the
old control the show was over-milled a.nd over-
staffed. I quite agree that the future lies below
the Tunnel, but I fully expect more values to be
there than will ever be found above that level.
Kuala Lumpur (F.M.S.) is not bursting
records in its boring on the 180 preset
rubber land adjoining. Ambrose Pratt
bracketed the future closely with these pros-
pects when the option was taken. In the
boring results given out even traces an.
placed on record. The latest batch of I >
holes, varying from 21ft. to 58ft., gave from
l°oz to sioz. for half the number, the otliei
eight merely making traces. If gold were
the quest the figures would be something to
enthuse over, but in tin an average of under
2oz. from numerous holes is useless. *
Enthusiastic buyers of Thabawleik shares
at 365. cooled when the Melbourne office
announced a cable from A. W. Freeman, put-
ting the productive stage back for another
year. The property is 70 miles from Mergui,
the port of Lower Burma, and is difficult
of approach for the ponderous sections of a
100,000 yards bucket dredge. This is being,
supplied by a Singapore co., and “all except
]OO tons” has arrived at Banian, the head
of navigation on the Tenasserim River.
Thence the route is by road, the last eight
miles of which had to be built by the co.
and a low-level bridge erected. The pontoon
is on the lease, and the remainder of the
plant should be there before May. Of 3360
acres acquired 651 are certified to carry 15ft.
of dirt worth 1.461 b. tin oxide, or 16,400,006
yards in all. giving a 14-year life. Austral
Malay paid £35,000 in cash and shares to the
Wightmans of Rangoon for the options and
sold them to the Freeman group for £95,000
in 60,000 paid shares and £35,000 in cash.
The co. got in £lOO,OOO in £1 shares, and
40,000 are held in reserve. With the 60,000
paids to Austral Malay, there will presum-
ably be 200,000 shares claiming dividends
when they come along. Meantime there has
been a sharp drop in price.


The Individual Prosperity.
THE Individual Australian Fortune may have been founded on the first
stroke of the miner's pick, the first furrow the farmer turned, or the
first lamb of the pioneer shepherd’s flock, but the vast majority of
fortunes are the result of planning for the future.
Have you planned for yours?
The greater number of our people are wage and salary earners who
can look only to thrift to establish a competence in later life. For them
there is no better means than the Savings Bank account, and no better
service than one which offers its facilities at all Post Offices and Branches.
Over a million people have found it in the
domnionwealtl) lank of Australia.

been appointed to the command of the naval
training-ship Tingira, was born in Maori-

the same Tingira, then in the Australian
sailing trade, which carried the elder Garsia
to his new home.

The Historical Society has been respon-
.sible for placing a slab, let into the foot-
path, at the corner of William aud Flinders
streets, Melbourne, to mark the approximate
landing place of Batman. The inscription
reads; “John Batman landed near this spot
... .June, 1835. ‘This will be the place for
a village.' ” A grandson and a great-grand-
son were present at the unveiling ceremony.
As a marquis, the late Nathaniel Curzon
shared with three others, Camden, Conyag-
ham and Townshend, the novelty of not using
the customary “of” in his title —he was the
Marquis Curzon. Having no son, the arro-
gant tag dies with its sole holder, unless
another Scarsdale or Howe: the other
branch of the Curzon family—fights his way
up the noble ladder. One is well started on
the stairs of notoriety—Viscount Curzon,
M.P., heir to the Howe earldom, who has
been fined 22 times for motor-speeding!
Like Alec Peacock, Dr. Billy Maloney,
M.H.R., has been 36 years in Parliament.
Both were returned to the Vic. Assembly
for the first time on March 28, ISB9. Alec
remained in the Assembly and has held office
in 14 Ministries; Billy left the State
House 22 years ago to walk into the Reps,
as member for Melbourne, and has held the
seat since. Peacock had a try for the
Senate in 1903, when Sargood took flight for
the Beyond, but the State Parliament put
in Robert Reid, M.L.C.
An unspectacular career has landed Her-
bert Vickers into the job of secretary to the
Premier of Victoria. For 37 years he has
plodded upwards in the service, keeping a
shorthand diary of the most prosaic daily
happenings, which enables him to give exact
details of incidents of long ago. That diary
is typical of the careful man who will keep
the feet of his chief from sliding on the
banana-skin of error in future.
South Aus. still has four survivors from
the Crimean War, though it occurred 70
years ago. A fifth was Joseph Moore, who
died the other day. He was in the Britan-
nia warship in the Black Sea, was in the.
first bombardment of Sebastopol, and watched
the Alma fight from the masthead. He
came to Australia in 1869, and mixed suc-
cessful storekeeping with good work in the
S.A. defence force.
Britain has no less than five living ex-Prime
Ministers. The oldest is Lord Rosebery
(77), whose day of greatness closed 30 years
ago. The others are Lord Balfour (76), the
recently ennobled Asquith (72), Lloyd
George (02) and Ramsay Macdonald (58).
Australia has four men who have won to the
top and passed on or out, viz., Watson (57),
Fisher (62), Cook (64) and Hughes (00).
Fate did a scurvy thing when it led Mary
Meyler under the wheels of a motor-lorry
recently. A pioneer trained nurse of Syd-
ney Hospital, and a life member of the
A.T.N.A., she had been matron of hospitals
here and in Westralia and nurse in charge
of tlyj isolation branch of the Benevolent
Asylum. At nearly 70, she was about to
realise her ambition to revisit her birthplace
in Dublin, and had already booked her pas-
sage and was on her way on St. Patrick’s
Day to make her will, when a violent death
intervened.
George Dunster, a Tumut (N.S.W.)
native, who heard the Last Post the other
day at Orange, got his first taste of soldier-
ing in the Boer disturbance, being then of an
age when he might well have been excused
from service. Yet lie was one of the first
to hand in his name —and, incidentally, dis-
guise his age—when the Big War started,
and was at the Gallipoli landing. Service
with the Light Horse in Egypt followed, till
a bullet through the lungs invalided him.
Death took one of the old school when
Dr. Pat Croker, of Geelong (Vic.), passed
on. He was a brother of handsome W. H.
Croker, in his day Melbourne’s most lordly-
looking lawyer, sportsman and pioneer of
brown coal investment; but Pat was clean-
shaven, ruddy and vastly fat. He died a
bachelor at law, but wedded to music in
fact. He owned a good practice in the
pioneer western city, but had many invest-
ments. and of late years medicine was more
a hobby than a vocation. His rounds were
done in a gig of English pattern, the driver
always wearing a belltopper with a cockade,
after the manner of pre-motor days.
To mark the diamond jubilee of his pro-
prietorship of the Kilmore (Vic.) Free
Press Tom Hunt was given a beano the
other night by his political and personal
friends in the local town hall. The veteran
of 84 reminisced of the days when he was
district member in the Assembly—from ’74 to
’92. and from ’O2 to ’OB. He met his Water-
loo by taking office as Lands Minister in
the tottering Bent Government at the end of
'OS. None of his old Parliamentary con-
temporaries except Prendergast, Opposition
Leader, turned up at the sliivoo, but
Everard, M.L.A., and Angliss and Russell
Clarke, M’s.L.C., of the present-day legisla-
tive contingent, joined in the revels.
During his Westralian tour. Priminister
Bruce picked up an expert whom he had
previously met at the Imperial Conference
and with whom he had then arranged to
visit. Australia. The expert is Sir George
Buchanan, the port and harbor authority
who got his knighthood for coaxing the
muddy Irrawaddy at Rangoon back to its
proper course, and his K.C.I.E. during the
big dust-storm in Mespot, where he was
director of munitions and, incidentally, the
SIR GEORGE BUCHANAN, imported by
the Commonwealth Government to re-
port on Australian port and harbor
works.
makrr of a ni'w port at Basra. Since thin
Buchanan, a quiet, small man with a fund
of interesting stories, has been in S’Africa,
where he helped Smuts to discover a new
port on the same side as Delagoa. The Aus-
tralian visit is to tell us how best to deal
with the ports of the Nor’-West and North.
At first Angwin and his colleagues did not
hanker after Buchanan’s Scotch advice, but,
following Bruce’s Fremantle speech, they
almost fell over the dash of his car to know
how soon and long they could have the little
man with the monocle. Bruce, however,
insisted that the Commonwealth should be
first served, and now Sir George is picking
out his oldest suit and strongest boots for
the trip to Darwin, Thirsty and other points
along the danger line of the North.
Died at Auckland, William Henry Buck,
Maori War veteran and farmer. lie mar-
ried Ngnrongo-Ki-Tna. of a celebrated North
Taranaki tribe, and lived to see his only
child, Dr. P. 11. Buck, become a brilliant
scholar and politician, and a splendid parti-
san of the Maori race.
Just dead, at Auckland, the sire of a very
distinguished son, who, as Lieut.-Commander
Sanders, won the V.C. and other decorations
for his daring feats when in command of
one of the mystery ships. Jellicoe in a re-
port put Sanders in the class of Nelson and
Drake, and it was the popular Admiral who,
some years later, as Governor of Maoriland,
handed the V.C. over to the father’s keeping
at the Auckland. Town Hall. The young
hero had been killed in the blowing-up of
his ship in 1917.
Old Melburnians are mourning the loss of
an old boy, Charlie Pearson, formerly of
Brighton (Vic.), who has passed out in a
nursing home in Brighton (Eng.). He was
one of the best football players the school
has turned out. Like the Rev. “Bert”
Plammond, the N.S.W. prohibitionist, who
is also an old boy of Melbourne Grammar,
he played with the Essendon team in the
days when it was a force to be reckoned
with. For several years he had made his
home in the Argentine, where he had big-
cattle interests.
Vic. Police Commissioner Nicholson is to
draw his £9OO for another year; after which,
although he may still hate leaving, Potter,
the best-advertised man of the C. 1.8., may
succeed him. The worst feature of in-
adequate pay for a high post is that it makes
the occupant a desperate hanger-on even
when his retirement is the best thing that
could happen to both himself and his job,
the pension attached usually being in-
adequate also. Nicholson has his good
points; but Melbourne’s experience is that
amongst them is not the ability to deal
with a crime wave.
Ilolled Smith, who passed out the other
day in the Cold Land, had the soft job of
Military Commandant in Vic. before Federa-
tion. His name is only faintly remembered
by a few. He figured in society a good deal
—and occasionally stroked some of the cats
the wrong way.
A pioneer of the meat industry in
Bananaland during the past half-century
was Frederick Oscar Granowski, who
migrated from Poland and set up meat-
works in various parts of Queensland
and in Bourke (N.S.W.). Also he was
instrumental in establishing several Conti-
nental industries throughout the Common-
wealth. and was engaged in placing a metal-
sprajing concern when Death stopped him
at 69.
V illiam J. Bournes, “official secretary of
the Unemployed Union of N.S.W'.," stated
before the National Insurance Commission
recently that his duties were those of
“general agitator, tickling up docile Gov-
ernments." Nevertheless, Bournes, who is
a signwriter and painter by trade, has thrown
many pounds of good paint about for the
docile Governments both in the N.T. and
Westralia. Several years ago lie was em-
ployed snaring painted finches and other
birds for export to overseas countries. After
several good seasons the docile Government
stopped the trade. A few years before the
Commonwealth Government took over the
North, Bournes contested the Darwin seat,
but was placed third to the late Tom Crush.
He is an honest little battler with a sincere
sympathy for the unemployed, and he has
had the pleasure of placing many of his
union members in a much better position
than he is ever likely to be in himself.
La Touche Armstrong, who is only slightly
over 60, has thrown up his job of chief
librarian of Melbourne Public Library. Lat-
terly he drew £950 a year. R. D. Boys, the
next in command, has a good chance of suc-
ceeding him.
A rare distinction has just come to the
Convent of the Sisters of the Missions in
Christchurch (M.L.). Sister Mary St. Domi-
tille. of that institution, is the first woman
in M.L. to win the degree of Doctor of
Literature.
Closed the ledger, James Broughton,
banker, in his 71st year. llis father was
Thomas Broughton, M.P., a member of the
first City Council of Sydney, and its Mayor
in 1547. His grandfather came to Australia
with the guns in 1790, and the grandson more
or less carried on the tradition by becoming
a member of the old City Gun Club.
R. D. Elliott, tin; youngish Australian
who is managing-director of the Arm-
strong Whitworth Australian Co., is
going to England on a holiday by the
Oronsay. Elliott has two main hob-
bies : collecting pictures (he is on the com-
mittee of the National Gallery) and brains;
and although his co. has an English origin
the brains are mostly Australian. The men
he has gathered into the Armstrong Whit-
worth service include Craig, who was con-
sulting engineer for the Victorian railways:
Leonard, a well-known N.S.W. engineer;
Skerritt, of the Electrolytic Zinc service;
Oliver, a son of a former N.S.W. Railway
Commissioner, who was with the Anglo-Per-
■sian and Commonwealth Oil Co.; and Irwin,
from the Melbourne University. As blandly
close as a Chinaman upon matters he does
not wish to discuss, Elliott talks to the pur-
pose when he has something to say; and his
views about responsibility were epitomised
in a proposal that the Melbourne Gallery
should be placed under a manager. His
view is that one man can always do a job
better than a dozen.
“Pat Bushie”: Elijah Leary, who not long
ago relinquished
duty as sheriff’s
officer at New-
castle (N.S.W.),
has seized most de-
scriptions of port-
able property in his
time. He used to
be afraid that he
would have to quit
before he levied on
an aeroplane; but
the chance came at
last, and then *he
retired a Imos t
happy.
ELSA KTRALIA.
I)r. Walter E. Roth. who was for many
years Chief Protector of Aborigines for
Queensland, now lias an important job in
British Guiana. Word comes thnt he has
left for a six months’ tour of the border
between Guiana and Brazil to study some
tribes whose reputation for assaulting white
men is the only certain fact known about
them.
A SONG OF JOYFUL RELIEF.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
It does not matter what it was, but it is over now.
Tue madd'ning prick of teasing- cares no longer
racks my brow;
And, as with one who sheds a load and easts him
down to rest,
The ease that now my spirit knows with strange-
ness seems oppressed.
For weeks the strain was at my heart, the vultures
pecked my brain,
Whilst trouble held me firmly bound with duty as
its chain ;
All circumstance was as a rack that strove my
soul to break ;
Now free, though sore, a song remains for me in
every ache.
Care bludgeoned me upon my head with many a
numbing clout;
My troubles seized me by the heels and twirled
me round about,
Then threw me crashing in the mud and, giving me
no rest,
Assailed my ribs with hob nailed boots and jumped
. upon my chest.
Hut that is over. All the world is full of soothing
songs ;
At once I want to rest alone and jazz amongst
the throngs.
1 cannot settle down to work; 1 simply want to
smile
l T pon a world grown good again and let tilings
slide awhile!
It docs not matter what it was. This is no proud
disguise
To hide a very private grief from an. prying eyes;
Hut simply my philosophy. I let the ills gone by
Rest in abysses deep and dark where tilings forgotten
lie.
1 face the future that may come, no wrinkles on my
brow—
It docs not matter what it was since it is over now!

The end of the rabbit pest.
CALCIUM CYANIDE.
FUMO
BRAND
CALCIUM CYANIDE has met with absolute success wherever
it has been used for rabbit extermination. It cannot fail.
Blown into the warren like dust, it gives off deadly fumes
for at least twenty-four hours INSIDE THE WARREN.
This is a big advantage over other fumigants, the fumes of
which are generated outside and blown in, for with them
the fumes are very soon absorbed by the soil.
CALCIUM CYANIDE penetrates even the deepest dead-ends
and makes every opening visible with a
dust cloud.
The Fumo Dust Blower has been specially
designed for its application, a.s the result
of 12 months’ experience. It is strong,
simple and convenient. The supply of
dust is under direct control and can be
completely shut off if desired.

ABORICINALITIES
MADE IN AUSTRALIA
BARNES - LINSEED OIL
"Centurion” : The menace to this country
contained in the rapid increase of wild dogs in
Centralia has had a curious parallel in Canada,
where Northern Ontario and adjoining wooded regions
have been experiencing an extraordinary increase
of timber wolves. The reason is the same in both
cases—a great increase in food supply. But while
the spread of the wild rabbit in millions has solved
the cost-of-living problem for the Australian dingo,
the strict Canadian game laws are blamed for the
return of the wolf. Small and big game of all
sorts have tremendously increased with protection
in the northern woods, and the beast that preys
on them lias followed suit. Then, when the vigorous
Canadian winter has closed many hunting grounds
and driven much food to winter shelter, the wolves
have transferred themselves to the settled districts of
the south. Only a portion of them return to the
north with the Spring; the rest settle down in
their new surroundings, and worry the stock . riow
turned into the open. Great wolf drives have been
organised and bonuses given, but a clear way out
has yet to be discovered.
“28”: Let me tell “Billy See” (B.
12/3/’26) that the old Coolgardic camel record for
weight lifting was much more than 9141 b. 1
have seen many camels sold there, arid * quite a
usual guarantee on the part of the auctioneer when
offering a bull was that the smellful beast would
rise with half a ton, which implied that he would
tr,,..sport the same. It was as usual as the ton trial
with a draught horse.
* * * *
“Boronia”: Tell “Geo. Rich” (B.
26/2/’25) that fencing posts split from young jarrah
are seldom affected by dry-rot. This trouble occurs
only when posts are knocked out of an old tree, the
timber of which is always dark and “cheescy.”
Dry-rot invariably makes its appearance on gravelly
ridges when inferior jarrah is used.
* * * *
“Weasel”: There was a strong suspicion
of Satan rebuking sin about Papuan officialdom’s
condemnation of the action of Alan McCulloch, of
the Australian Museum, and Frank Hurley in collect-
ing skulls and other things
allegedly regarded as sacred by
the natives, if one may accept
the ingenuous confession of M.
M. Taylor, a Yankee visitor to
Papua. He describes in his latest
book how, in wild mountain coun-
try where no white man had ever
been seen (except a prospector
named Mclntosh whom the abo-
rigines tried to eat with his
boots on), he came on a skull on
the fence round a burial platform.
An old village constable who was
with the party begged him not to
touch it, but the magistrate who
was acting as his bear-leader not
only insisted on taking it away,
but made the shuddering old con-
stable carry the grisly relic. The
tarrying off of the skull aroused
tierce hostility from the natives.
They threatened to rush the party,
but Taylor had a brain-wave. He
pulled his shirt off, and when the
natives saw his white skin they
ran for their lives. After that,
whenever they were uncertain of
the temper of the natives, the
white man who was in the lead
would strip to the waist, and his
color always proved too much for
the nerves of the savages.
★ * *
“C. Coral”: A custom that
still survives in some of the Torres
Strait islands is connected with
the landing of the first turtle for
the season. As it is hauled ashore
on to fjjie sandy beach, a young
coconut is brought and opened,
and the fresh water allowed to
run down over the head of the
turtle and into its mouth, while
the old women chant a song of thanksgiving and
entreat the “fast” turtle out in the sea not to move
away.
* * * *
“Jesmond” (B. 12/3/’25) says
that adobe houses require a dry climate. Well, mine
stands in one of the wettest parts of Victoria —
absolutely the dampest last year—and though it has
been up 15 years it does not show the least sign
of wear; in fact, the walls are now harder than when
erected. And as they are not protected by verandahs
they get the full benefit of whatever weather is going.
The house consists of five large romps, and there are
neither foundations nor dampeourse; the adobe blocks
(15in. x 9in. x 7in.) were laid on the surface of the
soil, and the walls carried up. My place is built on
a high gravelly ridge, so is naturally well drained.
In a low situation, or one subject to seepage, I
suppose it would be necessary to lay a foundation, as
“Jesmond” suggests.
“Herodot”: “Booth B.” (B. 12/3/'25) not-
withstanding, fish are frequently thrown up out of
the water by exploding dynamite. 1 have seen them
rise as high as 10ft. It all depends on where the
fish are when the stuff explodes. If they happen to
be anywhere near the top, it is almost certain a few
will be hurled clear of the water, but if they dive
immediately the charge is thrown in, as they gener-
ally do. this is not so likely to happen. As regards
the noise of the explosion, a dull thud can sometimes
ONE OF THE SAME PERSUASION.
“A glass of beer, please, dearie!”
“We don’t serve ladies here. I’m sorry!”
“I ain’t no lidy, dearie. I’m just a barmaid, same as
you!”
be distinguished for a considerable distance. Under;
water this sound becomes a tremendous uproar and
can be heard for miles by anybody who chances Ur
have his head submerged at the time. Incidentally,
fish are seldom killed by the force of the explosion;
as a rule, the shock merely stuns them, and they
float unconscious on the surface, where, if left alone,
many will revive. It does not take much to stun a
fish. In inland streams in Victoria I have seen
them caught by simply exploding unslaked lime in
a corked pickle-bottle. The lime was placed in
the bottle, with a sinker and a cork with a small
hole in it. When the bottle sank water trickled in
through the hole in the cork, and carbonic-acid gas
was generated. In a minute or two there was an
explosion which yielded quite as good a harvest as
a plug of dynamite.

Croweatcr” : For the information of that
Australian in King’s College, Cambridge (B. 5/3/’25),
a party of South Australians, travelling in the ’fifties
to the Victorian diggings, ran short of meat, and,
there being nothing else available, shot and ate
crows. Arrived at their destination, they were asked how
they had got on for meat crossing the desert, and
related how they had supped on the melancholy
fowl with the black plumage. Straightway their
camp was dubbed “the croweaters’ camp,” and the
designation being regarded as neat and appropriate
to the then circumstances of South Aus., every
South Australian became a Oroweater to the rest of
the n nl ' v n from tb"t time forth.

“Rex”: It has been said that the art, of
tracking is dying out amongst the present genera-
tion of aboriginals, but if it is dying it certainly
isn’t dead. Walking from Acton (Fed. Territory)
to Qucanbeyan, I was joined by a young Wagga
black, who stated that he had picked up my tracks
on the road and had hurried up so as to overtake me.
I was somewhat doubtful, but was completely con-
vinced when he accompanied me back on the fol-
lcwing day. He pointed out where, on several occa-
sions,' I had left the metal road to avoid passing
vehicles; where I had knocked the ashes from my
pipe on a roadside boulder ; where I had stopped to
tie a bootlace.
* ■ * * *
“T.K.T.”: “Billy See” (B. 12/3/’25) can't
have seen much of camel-carrying when he talks of
9141 b. as a record load. I remember a camel that
shifted two cases of galvanised-iron, weighing
22401 b. without the cases, across the road at Oodna-
datta. From 6cwt to Bcwt. is an ordinary
bull or bullock load when starting from Oodni-
datta on the long trips up the overland telegraph.
The same class of camel will carry Bcrwt. to lOcwt.
of ore on short stages in the Oloncurry (Q.) country.
At Hatch’s Creek I saw a white bull whose owner
offered to bet a miner 150 notes (he produced the
evidence) against a ton of wolfram that it would get
up with a ton and shift it across a mark its own length
ahead of it. The wager did not come off, the miner
not caring to chance his wolfram. Personally I
would have backed the wolfram, but the owner put
on nine bags, 13jcwt. * deadweight, and the beast got
up and carried it abfiut a mile down to the camel
camp without any trouble. Afghan and Indian drivers
are out of date as Regards camel records since the
white man went intfo the game.
* ** * *
“Toonooba”: Darnley Island (Torres
Strait) has given ,up relics other than those of the
Spanish. While ‘'there recently one of our party
secured from the natives three
stones, two of granite and one
of volcanic rock. Each was about
■sin. long, circular in section, and
•lin. greatest diameter, tapering
to a point at either end. The
taper was concave and ground
smooth. Evidently the stones had
been used as grinders or pestles
■originally. At least two were im-
ported, us there is no granite on
Darnley. The artifacts were found
buried side by side, about loin,
deep, in a garden patch over-
looking Massacre Hay. They were
the first of their kind to be seen
on the island, and the natives could
give no explanation of their use.
Probably they are the relics of an
earlier race of more primitive cul-
ture, and came to be used as fetich
stones or their equivalent by the
later comers. It’s on the cards
that further relies will come to
light. We were told that certain
of the natives know of a cache on
the island containing, among other
things, a pair of spectacles.
* # »
“Dry”: I watched for two
hours a fight between a tree
(white-spotted) and a ground
(yellow-striped) goanna. For slow-
ness in action they were nearly
equal to a Test-match cricketer.
At the cud of the first hour Stripes
hud inflicted only a small puncture
under the throat with a claw.
Spots occasionally caught hold of
Stripe’s ribs in its capacious jaws;
the grating of its teeth along
the scaly ribs made a sound
similar to that which a small boy
makes on a corrugated-iron fence
with a stick, though not so loud,
of course. Spots could not make
a mark on Stripes. The fight
spoilt my faith in the yarn of a
snake biting a go’, and poisoning
It. Fangs could not penetrate the hide of a go’.
* * * .
“Caloola”: “Fana” (B. 5/3/’25) need not
v go to the tropics to get moonstruck. I saw a case
fa few years ago at Boorowa (N.S.W.) ; the victim
' was a rouseabout who pulled his bunk out of the
hut and slept in the open one sultry moonlight night.
In the morning his face was horribly distorted. The
-local doctor gave it a fancy name and prescribed,
the afflicted countenance got back to normal in
■ about 10 days, but the rouseabout won’t venture
■out in the moonlight now without an umbrella.
“Nikko”: A relative of mine slept on the deck
of a small coastal boat in broad moonlight, lie
woke up with a facial contortion that persisted for
some time. Apropos, there is a widespread legend
that fish left exposed to bright moonlight is unfit for
food. I have known several cases of poisoning that
were attributed to this muse, and many anglers
cover their catch from the light of the moon on the
principle that prevention is better than a funeral.
THE RIGHT SENSE Of DIRECTION.
BINKS ( watching friend disappear into
hotel ): “Great pity! Clever politician
and all that, you know—horn leader of
men!”
JINKS: “That so? I’ve half a mind to follow
him myself.”
“Jacky Roo”; Two tremendous aloe plants
in our front paddock have shot forth two per-
pendicular stems about 30 feet high. The tops arc-
covered with a cluster of yellow flowers. Pears'
Cyclopaedia avers the aloe flowers every eight years,
whereas an old hand swears that it flowers but once
in 25 years, and then dies. Who is right?

THE SPECKLED VAMP.
[For The Bulletin.]
They tell the yarn in Kggville yet, although its
beard is long,
Of Ifiley's speckled Wyandotte and her seductive
song.
Old Riley then was young and poor and, though
that’s not a sin,
He thought it was and wished lie had a bucketful
of tin ;
For Itiley he had set his heart on winning Maggie
Wren,
And how he did—well, that’s the yam of Riley's
speckled hen.
The hen she came to Riley like a bolt from out
the blue;
A hawk had dropped her as above young Riley’s
farm it (lew.
She landed safely in a clump of bamboo-grass, and
so
Became a valued portion of the young man’s mar-
riage “dough.”
He rescued her and found her bones were all'intact,
and then
She softly clucked and nestled in his arms, that
speckled hen.
She softly clucked and winked at him as if to say
“I’m yours.”
A voice seductive, such as hers, no Irishman abhors.
He quickly found that others, too, could not with-
stand her cluck,
And named her Cleopatra, for she out-vamped Caesar’s
duck.
She won from other broodies all the chickens in the
pen,
And soon a hundred chicks as Ma knew Riley’s
speckled hen.
She won them all and coaxed them in beneath her
ample wings.
By just the same sweet chorus that the untamed
syren sings—
WILLING TO HELP HIM.
“ I’d like to see something cheap in a straw hat.”
“ Certainly, sir. Try this one on, sir, and the mirror’s on
your left.”
At least they called them syrens once, but vamps
is now the word.
So large a brood would prove a bore to any other
bird,
But Cleo quite ambitious grew, as do tbe queens of
men,
And neighbors’ pens were ransacked by young Riley’s
speckled hen.
Fresh pens she daily conquered, and full fifty chicks
or more
With her trailed home to Riley’s farm, while Riley
kept the score.
And while all Kggville wondered where their broods
of chicks had gone,
Young Riley’s face with innocence and satisfaction
shone.
He saw the day approaching when his girl, young
Maggie Wren,
Could claim a half-share in his prize, his vampish
speckled hen.
The other poultry-farmers tripped into the bankrupts’
court,
But Riley prospered. Well, let’s cut the soulful story
short:
Old Riley was a poor man once, but now his roll is
fat,
And Maggie Riley, too, is plump, but nothing’s
wrong in that.
Poor Cleo long is dead and gone, but Riley's thanks
rise when
He sees upon its pedestal a sad, stuffed speckled hen!

“Yarran”: Boulia (Q.) was recently re-
ported to have recorded a shade temperature of
130 deg. Official confirmation was not forthcoming,
however. 1 have seen it stated that 127 deg. on
January 16, 1877 (locality not mentioned), is the
official Australian record. Gullett, in his history of
the Palestine campaign, mentions shade registra-
tions of 128 deg. in the Jordan Valley. I believe
him. It felt like it. Does anyone know when and
where it has been officially hotttest in the shade on
this globe? And some Australian records too —only
don’t make things too warm!

“Wai-hoi”: “Fana’s” moonstruck overseer
(B. 5/3/’25) reminds me of an Adelaide resident
who some 28 years ago, when travelling on the
P. and O. Cuzco through the Mediterranean, got
facial paralysis while sleeping one night in full
moonlight on the boat deck. I saw him last 15
years back, and he still had the same twist in his
features. Is the cause of this paralysis the same
as that which affects fish when left exposed to moon-
light ?

“Pick”: While sojourning on Southern

rider stiffened the loosely-dangling limbs with strips
of green bark bound with rushes, and the maimed
mammas disconsolately limped away with their
lambs. Eight days later I saw the improvised
splints removed. The bones had knitted perfectly,
and beyond a bare, woolless, sap-stained ring
where the binding had been there was nothing to
indicate that there had been any injury.

a few cupfuls every winter, and comes in full with
the Spring. This cow has kept a family of six in
milk since her only calf arrived. She has seen her
erring daughter come of age, marry and divorce
several husbands, leave the old home, and change
owners three times; and Ma is still going strong.
I have heard it said that such a cow’s milk is not
wholesome; but the family this one supplies with
milk hasn’t shown any ill effects, and the liquid
certainly looks and tastes all right.
“FY7”: Touching “Iford’s” angler (B.
12/3/’25) who claimed that he kept fish alive for
three weeks by tethering them in the water, there
is nothing to show whether he fed them or not. With
the Murray cod, at least, this is important. At
Doondi station, between St. George and Dirranbandi,
on the Balonne River (Q.), there is a huge hole
A PROBLEM.
ENGINEER : “That big wheel makes .nearly a thousand revolutions per minute
CORNCOB: “ Struth! How long did it take per to count ’em?”
famous for its cod. One or more of these were
sometimes tethered, but we always found that they
fell away rapidly if not fed. Years afterwards,
reading an account of the processes followed by the
N.S.W. Fisheries Department in obtaining the eggs
of Murray cod for hatching and transfer to other
waters, I noted that the necessity of regular feeding
of the captive cod was stressed. The cruelty of
tethering is debatable. Fish give no evidence of
suffering from mouth-hooking, and I doubt whether
the reverend angler’s lip-tethering methods would
give as much pain as, say, bitting a young colt.
* * • *
“Quero”: The theory that a murderer in-
variably revisits the scene of his crime is applicable
to four-footed creatures as well as bipeds. Shcp-
herds say that a sheep-
worrying dog usually
returns in about 10
days to view the spot
where he had a night
out, even when he has
not taken the precau-
tion to bury a little of
the spoil near by. Such
a dog has been seen to
examine the place care-
fully, and then slink
off with an air which
indicates that he is well
aware of his fall from
rectitude. And birds
have similar ways. In
M.L., some time ago, I
watched two pheasants
fighting on a small
clearing. When the
bout was over they both
sought the shelter of
the gorse, one going
each side. Presently
the vanquished one re-
turned, and sadly sur-
veyed the scene of his
defeat. He had scarcely
gone when the victor
and a companion strut-
ted out to view the
place of triumph. He
had brought the lady,
the cause of the combat, to see the exact spot on
which he had bashed his rival.
* * * *
“Bos”: “Up Top” (B. 5,/3/’25) writes of
“caterpillars that make enormous parchment-like
nests in the branches of trees.” These caterpillars
were at one time very plentiful on the plains west of
Echuca (Vic.). They are usually called the pro-
cessional caterpillar from their habit, when on the
move, of following the leader, head to tail, in a
long queue. Their cast-off skins produce a violent
skin irritation.
* * » *
“Hamer”: Queensland doesn’t own all the
somersaulting motor-cars. The other day a Melbourne
motorist who was trying to drive his ’bus over the
Merri Bridge, on the Heidelberg-road, crashed
through a picket fence and went over a 30-foot
embankment. His car also somersaulted, and came
down right side up, with the motorist still in his
seat; and his only complaint was that the incident
left him with a stiff neck.
“Nugget”: Home-making with the mallee-
fowl is a serious business. Though not so large As
the ordinary domestic fowl, a pair of these birds
will erect a mound nest 4ft. in height and fully 12ft.
in circumference. Eggs are placed in an opening in
the top of the mound at the rate of two or three
a week for a period of about six weeks. Each egg
is carefully covered with earth and vegetable matter
till near hatching time, when it is uncovered again.
Owing to the long period of time over which the
female is actively engaged in laying, some of tUe
young chicks are hatched before the last egg is placed
in the nest. The young birds are not permitted to
fend for themselves, though they are fully feathered'
and quite capable of running and flying after their
first day in the open air. The parent birds collect
their precocious offspring and care for them till they
begin to seek nouse-building sites for themselves.
* * * *
“Veronal”: Death from the bite of a
snake is usually very painful, but there was a
case recorded in 1880 where a man bitten by a
brown snake passed out peacefully without feeling
discomfort. Strychnine, injected for cobra-bite, is said
only to intensify the agony. It has also been tried
for the bite of the red-striped spider, but was found
useless, and, I believe, is now a discarded remedy.
So far as bites from both deadly snakes and this
spider are concerned, permanganate of potash crystals,
moistened, still hold sway as the most efficient
and powerful destroyer of the venom. The crystal
can easily be carried in the pocket, and must be
applied quickly—before the poison has time to
circulate.
* * # *
“Bad Australian”: I thought I was
acquainted with every variety of reptile in the
mountainous districts of Vic., but I found one a few
days ago that has me
guessing. He is of
slender build and a
little over a foot long.
The head is flat and
wide for its size, and
brownish black in
color; the tail ends in
a rather sharp point,
and is of the same
color as the head. The
remainder of the rep-
tile is evenly banded
with rings of the same
color as the extremi-
ties, alternating with
white; the dark rings
are slightly broader on
the back than on the
under parts, while the
white markings are
broad below and nar-
row on top. There are
about 40 bands of each
color, and they circum-
navigate the loathy
worm. I have the evi-
dence in a large medi-
cine bottle and a small
two bobs’ worth of bad
rum. If the rum had
been any good at all
the evidence would
have vanished.
“H. Pannikin”: A motor-lorry on the
Harwood road (N.S.W.) put up a record. It col-
lided with a hare and killed it. No record about that?
But the hare had two tails. Any other part of Aus-
tralia with a motor-killed two-tailer?
“Gouger”: About 30 years ago. during a
big drought, countless thousands of fish died in
Australian rivers, notably in the Barcoo country.
In 1917 many Queensland rivers became floating
morgues. Fish oughtn’t to die in a drought, because
there’s plenty of water always left in the rivers,
but they do ; the cause is a fungus growth. Greyish
white patches settle on the body and grow rapidly,
just as a fungus will grow on a rotting log under
favorable conditions. Pick one of the million dead
fish out of the river and you’ll see sand and fine
pebbles amongst the flaked fungus, where the fish
has been trying to rub the awful stuff off. The
parasite gets down into the gills, clogging up the
works, and the myriad roots penetrate to all parts
of the body. When the rains come, with fresh water
and sediment, the disease disappears.
• * » •
“Troophorse”: Torres Strait has some
queer characters, black and white. Old Balbo, a
Manilaman, lives a simple life on an islet off the
western approach of Endeavour Passage, which sepa-
rates Prince of Wales and other islands from the
mainland south of Cape York. Balbo combs the
beaches and scrapes acquaintance with both varieties
of the turtle family. He eats Chelonia my das and
commercialises C. imbricata. Perhaps twice a year
he will launch his little whale-boat and make passage
to Thursday Island for flour, tea and sugar. One of
the old chap’s favorite dishes is an omelet made from
grated cocoanut and turtle egg fried in oil. If
dugong oil is procurable it sets the dish off to
better advantage. Besides looking after his grove
and turtles, old Balho visits the outlying reefs and
sai.dbanks at low water collecting bfiche-de-mer,
troches and shell of all classes and sizes. His only
companions are (or were when I visited him) a
couple of pigs and a little dog, and they fatten
on turtle eggs, too. He is a cheerful old soul
and always has a billyful of the best toddy hanging
from a cocoanut palm.
# * * «
“Jesmond”: What is there about native-
bears that makes cows go mad? Now that Teddies are
becoming numerous on Phillip Island (Vic.) it is
almost a daily occurrence for us to have the whole
herd bellowing and careering around and incidentally
giving a bear a very rough time. Twice during
the past week I’ve had to dog the herd off one. In
the first case, while I had the cows under the control
of the dog, the bear, which was badly knocked about,
refused to make for the nearest trees, but persisted
in going towards the cows. As she seemed to be
looking for trouble I was on the point of calling
off the dog, when she hopped under an acacia bush,
came out with a young one, and then made for
the timber.
“Alastor”: Four deatli-adders killed one
afternoon on the verandah of the Shamrock Hotel,
Drillham, a small town on the south-western Queens-
land line, some 268 miles from Brisbane, is surely
an Australasian record. Death-adders in the dis-
trict are so common that no one would dare venture
out at night, even for a long beer, without a hand
flashlight.
* * * *
“Munjong”: I recently noticed a young
bronze cuckoo, on a fence, being fed by blue wrens.
It was calling in exactly the same way as young
wrens do when hungry. Was this conscious camou-
flage or merely accidental mimicry?
* * * *
“Billy See”: I will back Fremantle
(W.A.) for snails. A big black fellow, about ljin.
in uiameter, is the original inhabitant; since the war
a new species has arrived—a pretty little fellow
with a pink shell and spiral markings. Rumor
credits him with an Egyptian origin and some
bales of compressed fodder as his means of trans-
port. Anyway, he ought to be a Levantine; he
does so well in this country. Less than two years
ago, when the rinderpest was raging, these snails
A MODERN INNOVATION.

“Of course you didn’t; it’s only just been invented.”
spread over the district in millions. No place was
free from them; even the muzzles of war trophies
on the sea-front were lined with them. Many
people thought this invasion was the cause of the
rinderpest, but the idea was scouted by scientific
authority.
THE GOOD OLD DAYS.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
Those good old days that used to be
Before the times that now we know,
When life was full of fire, and free
From all the present cark and woe—
Ah, we can always spill some tears
About those splendid far-off years!
In those old days beer, real good beer,
Cost only threepence for a mug.
For sixpence, Bung, with perfect cheer,
Would fill a “squareface” or a jug.
What we forget in dreams so fair
Is—sixpences were rather rare.
Yet life was joyous, sans all doubt.
To races ’twas worth while to go ;
And Trumper knocked the ball about
Till even cricket was not slow,
Whilst hotels never got us out
Till it was twelve or thereabout.
Our friends with nothing much to share
Would share it willingly enough.
The prospect, looking back’s, so fair,
Not even rocky roads were rough :
And landladies wlio’d nag and shuuv.
Are something now to laugh about.
We grumble at each prick and thorn
About the roses now we cull.
The wound will vanish ere the morn,
The flower still be beautiful ;
And these will be the golden days
That we in future years will praise!
VICTORIIA,
HAMER.

As President of the British Musical
Society, Mrs. Jimmy Dyer called her brother
and sister members into her flower-decked
Toorak parlors to extend a hand of greet-
ing to Elsa Stralia and co. In voicing the
welcome Mrs. Jimmy breathed a hope that
British music would find a place in the
Stralia concert programmes. The star
guest, who suggested a ray of moonshine
on an inky sea, averred she would rather
sing than talk her answer, and modestly ad-
mitted to being proud of having made Aus-
tralia proud of her. Thereafter Gertrude
llealey made sweet music with her fiddle,
and Henry Thomas warbled a delightful
cycle of songs by a Melbourne composer, the
late I). G. Coutts, to piano backings by
Doris I-laddon. Sutton Grow mentioned that
a thousand copies of the Coutts songs re-
main unsold, and invited the company to
help dispose of them. Supper served under
the rosy glow of red candle-shades cpilogued
the gathering.
The Austral Salon shared its blessing be-
tween Elsa Stralia and a trio of members,
Mrs. 0. B. Moore, Mrs. Strang and Miss
Botch, just back from the other side of the
Equator. Mrs. Quinnell recited the ode
of welcome, and reinforced it with a posy of
ttowers for the star guest. A musical pro-
gramme was punctuated with cream puffs
and pekoe. Members had crowded in to
greet the singer, who warmed biscuit-colored
crepe and lace with a raven satin wrap
dadoed with silver. With her came Uncle
Sobell, Mrs. Hugo Fischer and a couple of
skirted attendants.
The Institute of Arts and . Literature
offered an ornate programme the other night
in the little Queen’s Hall, when a young
Italian fiddler, Pietro Sarcoli, scraped his
first bow before an Aussie audience, which
he roused to something like rapture. F. Colin
Macrae sang a' cycle of Masefield’s sea songs
with a nautical lilt, and a new play from the
flowing pen of Charles Carter (Karta)
trundled from a bright beginning to a not-
too-obvious conclusion in which a well-timed
gag saved the situation. Its executioners
nlayed up creditably, but suggested an insuf-
ficiency of rehearsals.
Brighton’s Church of England Babies’
Home will get a tremendous boost from the
profits of a cafe-chantant in the Norman
Brookes’ house, Kurneh. Nearly 600 of the
skirted sex fitted somehow into the roomy
humpy. A sing-song served up in the musicy
room under the directorship of Mrs. Pauli
Carter was prologued with a fiddle solo by
Zelman, and had Eileen Castles and Violet
Somerset, Norman Bradshaw and Dr. Bar-
tolini as some of the items. Mrs. Gilbert
Lodge was on active service in the music-
room, Mrs. Harold and Mrs. Russell Grim-
wade marketed a florist’s shop, while the Jack
Menzies, Norman Armytage, Colin Fraser
and Harry Gullett mati'ons vended cakes
with profit. Lady Forster, who flashed saxe
blue to match her eyes, shed lustre from the
front chairs, holding the delphiniums shyly
handed over by little Hersey Brookes, who
fluttered up in nale pink, black velvet and
fair locks. A bunch of short-skirted flap-
pers, with heads tucked into small pull-on
lids, made hay with sweets -and flowers.
Ten-an’-cake were spread in a marquee cover-
ing the tennis court, all the gifts of Mrs.
Brookes.
Guida Hewison swore to make the toast
for Desmond Robinson the other night at
St. Kilda All Saints’. On brother Jack’s arm
she went to the halter in brocaded georgette,
swishing a pink-lined tail, and hid her
blushes under a Honiton lace veil, lent by
ex-Mayoress Swanson. St. Kilda Town
Clerk’s daughter Marie and Edith Bonnet
’maided in red georgette, with silver head
turbans, while Bryan Turner and Kenneth
Nicholson looked after the ’groom. Ger-
trude Grey enlivened the signing ceremony
with “Oh, Perfect Love.” The bride’s
widowed mother spread the cake and fizz at
her East St. Kilda home, Gwandalan.
Patrons of Carlyon’s, at St. Kilda, now
trip it to the music of a just imported band
of “Californian University Collegians,” a
likeable sextette of youths directed by pian-
ist Jinjmy Bachelder. Each adds to his
musical attainments a profession which
butters the crust his playing earns for him.
The innovation of Sunday afternoon and
evening concerts by the jazz specialists drew
for their premiere full houses beneath the
spreading chestnut-tree, whose boughs, elec-
trically lit with birds and blossoms some
400—span the ballroom. Georges Capel,
lately assigned the role of host, brings the
latest in attractions and the newest ol evo-
lutions from the London Savoy. In his ex-
hibition numbers he is partnered by grace-
ful Molly Ivensella. Loges with primrose
draperies and borders of shaded yellow tulips
make an effective background.
The Paris Salon couldn’t get on without it,
so ft. G. McCann’s Royal Academy land-
scape which roused the French and English
critics to enthusiasm is missing from Ins
exhibition at the Athenaeum. Krnght Alex-
ander Peacock unveiled the show, and in the
crowd were Donald Macdonald, the Maudsley
lady, Dr. and Mrs. Charlie Lempriere and
their daughter, the Louis Nelkins, Mrs. Jim
Ainslie and Mrs. Quinnell. The Nelkms, by
the way, are packing their bags to cross to
Sydney for the gaieties there. /
Half Albury packed itself into St. Mat-
thew’s Church the other night to see
Dorothy Moore linked up with _ Leslie
Colquhoun. The bride faced the Voice that
Breathed in snowy marocain, shimmering
with pearls and crystal. Sisters Edith and
Evelyn Moore, one in rose and the other in
mauve georgette, followed after, with their
heads tucked into hat brims of silver lace.
H. D. Terry and Donald Webb shepherded
the ’groom, and two golden-headed mites.
Audrey Colquhoun and Sally Davis, strutted
after the train. The William Moore pair
tapped the jollo in Malcolm’s Hall.
The death of his dad has made Sir Arthur
Stanley, our ex-Excellency, Baron Sheffield.
Since liis return to England he made one or
two efforts to re-enter the Commons, but was
unsuccessful. Now he will have to be con-'
tent with a cushion in the Lords.
While Geelong Grammar has been red-
lettering its history with a destructive fire,
the Girls’ Grammar in the Sleepy City has
been adding a couple of new sporting trophies
to its collection —the McKinley Shield, which
it carried off at the Brighton Ladies’ Swim-
ming Carnival; and the schoolgirls’ tennis
doubles. The school 19 years ago was the
home of the Armytages, and its iron gates
were designed by the veteran V.R.O. sec.,
Byron Moore.
Only relatives of the principal parties were
present at No. 9 Darling-street the other
night when little Nellie Millis, late energetic
secretary for the 14tli Battalion Comforts
Fund, said “I will” to the popular Brighton
doctor, Donald McLean.
It must be something of a record to play
a church organ, with complete charge of the
choir, for 30 years, as Mrs. S. Napper, of
the Anglican Cathedral, Sale, has done.
And before that she put in a term as assist-
ant organist. The talented lady is leaving
Gippsland for Melbourne, to Bishop Crans-
wick’s vast regret. But the city will
be the gainer, for pipe-organists with soul
as well as technique are rare birds.
Melbourne’s periodic wail of being musi-
cally starved will have to be omitted this
year. With Galli-Curei opening the ball.
Elsa Stralia following shortly after, and
Kreisler, Chaliapine, the London Symphony
Orchestra, Clara Butt, Altliouse and Middle-
ton and Florence Lett in the offing it looks
rather like a welter, in which local produc-
tions, including the four Conservatorium
orchestral concerts, stand a good chance of
being submerged.
With this is a Brootliorn picture of Linda
Webb, the clever Echuca girl who lately'-
stepped into
the literary
limelight a s
authoress
of a pleasant
little bush
yarn, “Wild
Poppies.” The
book is rapidly
acquiring the
dimensions of
a local best-
seller, and has
attracted com-
plimentary re-
ferences from
the critics.
Linda is the
wife of Alfred
Burge, mana-
ger of the
Woodend
branch of the
C o m m e rcial
Bank, an d
elder daughter of Captain and Mr e John
Webb. She was born and bred in Echuca,
and it was the color of her home town that
crept into the book.
Mrs. Jimmy Dyer, who presides over the
Old Collegians of the Presbyterian Ladies’
seminary, greeted 400 members on Friday
afternoon on the spreading lawns of her Too-
rak home, and unpacked her said-to-be up-
to-datest Paris frock and hat to do it in. A
perfect thriller this frock was. of subdued
green chiffon velvet and gold-embossed crepe;
but the guests gasped audibly at the skirt
hem caressing the ankles, the wide-brimmed
tile sweeping violently up on the port side
to a silken flower; and the black sunshade
shading its owner’s delicate fairness carried
a long handle. Dear, dear! And here we
were thinking that the French elegantes were
wearing shingled heads, tiny lids, short
skirts and stumpy brollies.
Kathleen Taylor came down from Echuca
to say “I will” to Maberly Scott, of Seymour,
at the Collins-street kirk the other evening.
She said it in silver-and-ivory brocade
hemmed with fur, and Eileen Macphcrson
played a lone hand as maid in green georg-
ette. Dick Webster had come from Seymour
to best-man the ’groom. The wedding feast
was held in the Quamby Club. The bride be-
longs to that big squatting clan of Quinns
who once owned Tarella, on the lower
Darling; and grand-dad sat for a while for
that district in the N. S. Wales Assembly.
Tasma Tiernan, whom Brootliorn snapped,
is a Melbourne girl who threatens with her
’cello to play
her way into
the high places
of music. In
1922 she won
the champion
’cello solo
event at the
Ballarat com-
petition, and
has a number
of other laurels
to her credit.
She is the ’cel-
I is t of the
British Musi-
ca 1 Society’s
quartette, prin-
cipal ’cellist in
the Melbourne
Symphony Or-
chestra, and
solo ’cellist in
the Broadcast-
ing Company
of Australasia. She is one of three gifted sis-
ters : the others are Olga, who plays the
harp, and Norma (Mrs. Stan Coleman),
who is a hue pianist.
Warrnambool residents have been felici-
tating Dorothy Younger, who stands self-con-
fessed of intending matrimony with a South
Australian, Stanley Gardiner. An elder
sister tied up with Carlos Gordon, whose
father once commanded S. Australia’s army.
General Bolton, who brought his family
from Ballarat some time back to settle in
seaside Brighton, has been faced with the
awful responsibility of handing a paternal
blessing to two daughters in the one breath.
Helen has promised to make _ Tom Hind-
haugli, eldest son of J. 11. Hindhaugh, of
Camperdown, happy, and Madge has agreed
to do the same for Edward Moray, son of
A. ,T. E. Moray, of Ballarat.
Old friend Charlotte Hemming had the ill-
luck to fracture her hip on the Dandenong-
road the other day and the healing will be
slow. The Shakspearean Society, of which
she is one of the stoutest props, will miss
her badly.
The Albert Miller widow, under convoy of
son Leo, will cross to England next month
to see her eldest granddaughter, Joyce Rus-
sell, linked up with Arthur Yenckcn. Orange
blossoms have been ordered in for June.
Members of the Arts and Crafts will
foregather at 9 Darling-street on the 22nd
for their annual financial reckoning. _ Of
considerable interest have been the sectional
exhibitions held at the new depot in Capitol
House, which by bringing into prominence
certain workers’ artistic efforts gave lime-
light to all. From an unpretentious begin-
ning prior to the war, and kept alive during
the years of the great conflict through
its spinning fund, the Arts and Crafts
Society now numbers about 200 members.
All are not dependent upon the sale of their
wares, but all are swayed by the one ideal
—“the highest standard of work to be main-
tained.” Secretary Mrs. Stewart Murray
is already making preparations for the big
yearly exhibition.

At a Government House discussion presided
over by Lady Forster, after Sutton Crow,
the ’Varsity Con. secretary, had outlined the
situation, the gathering unanimously
plumped for a committee to rope in sub-
scribers at a pound a head. This will
admit to all four concerts of the first season.
Violinist Bernard Heinze, who lately re-
turned from Europe to re-join the Con. staff,
offered a commendable slogan: “Subscribers,
not Donors.” The next thing is to attract
the audiences that are necessary to keep the
project going.
All the loftiest highbrows turned up at
No. 9 Darling-street to cheer ’Varsity Chan-
cellor John MacFarland to his trip over-
seas. Professorial and ’Varsity Council
experts released a flood of oratory
to which Knight John was quite com-
petent to respond. Dr. Douglas Stephens,
president of the Graduates’ Association, and
the secretary, M. M. Philips, with their
wives, stood to welcome the star guest, and
the ’Varsity Con. fringed the chatter with
musical items by some of its brightest pupils.
Supper was eaten on the wide verandah in
the rear, screened off from the draughts with
striped awnings.
The Ambulance Ball in the St. Kilda Town
Hall on July 29 threatens to be a raging
success. Mrs. Trapp, Mrs. Alfred Boyes and
Mrs. Nodrum have dropped £2l into the box
to pay for the music, and will also provide
the programmes, designed by Ray Whiting.
The veteran Tom Brentnall is offering a prize
to the person who sells the biggest sheaf of
tickets, and Ray Whiting will shoulder the
job of publicity man.
Melbourne talked quite a lot some time
ago about Muriel Benton’s voice, and Henry
Russell, artistic director with the Melba co.,
was moved to take it to Monte Carlo for
a final polishing. There it broke down un-
der its owner’s temporary illness, but the
voyage back has restored it, and it is to get
its first release again in this city on Good
Friday night in a sacred concert with
Walter Kirby.
Melbourne is to lose another of its best-
liked girls: the H. H. Haines’ younger
daughter Jeanne has promised to make a
date with the Joseph Winters’ son and heir,
Owen, of Balaringar, Merriwa (N.S.W.).
The widow of the late knight Samuel
Wilson passed out last month at Brighton
(Eng.), at the ripe age of 83. The dead
lady was a daughter of the late William
Campbell, of this State’s House of Land-
lords. She was a gentle creature and Rumor
has it that once when she and her husband
launched a big evening party at her Caulfield
house she draped the nakedness of some
statues in the liall with gauze.
Tas. Government Assayer Reid, who re-
presented the small island at Wembley last
year, is off again to the same job. With
Mrs. Reid he sails by the Persic some time
this month.
Cecil Hay has promised happiness to the
John Stonhams’ eldest son, Franklyn, of
Camberwell. She is the eldest daughter of
the late squatter Hay, of Boomanoomana
(N.S.W.) and his widow, now of Box Hill.
Adelaide’s observations: —
The simultaneous staging of the polo and tennis
tournaments has put a strain on the housing'capacity
of this village. Tents are filling, the equine bill at
the Hunt Club’s new yards, where some of the 250
ponies are stabled, with their attendants in marquees
hard by; but visiting athletes and their families
were less easily disposed of —-in these Mary-Annless
days private billeting isn’t easily accomplished. So
far poloists have mostly concentrated themselves on
the game, but half a dozen local players combined to
give a dance at the Glenelg Palais. %he frivol will
be the supper-dance, billed for the end of the week,
with S. H. Ayers, who runs Clare’s polo week, as its
presiding deity.
The Tubercular Soldiers’ Aid Society, one of the
hardest and quietest workers among patriotic
associations, has made its annual appeal—this time
it wanted £2500. The City Council’s veto on
street collections keeps badge-sellers in these days
within the boundaries of arcades and shop fronts, but
business was brisk and the counting shows good
totals.
The Walkerville Boys’ Home has achieved its
£6OOO, with over £lOO to the good, which joyous
fact was announced at its annual meeting, when it
decided to be known in future as the C. of E.
Home for Boys. Its balance-sheet showed that up-
keep works out at about £4O per head, of which
less than 4s. a week comes in maintenance fees.
The Anglicans’ next enterprise will be the pursuit of
£25,000 for the Cathedral, “urgently needed” as an
endowment fund, and for immediate repairs and im-
provements.
Mrs;. Bruce suffered meekly an orgy of tea-drinking
on Friday, including one cup at the Town Hall
with Mayoress Glover as hostess, and another at the
Liberal Club, with Mrs. C. R. Morris to pass the
sugar. At Clare, where the Bruces stayed with the
Dick Hawkers, there was a temporary cessation of
speeches while the Priminister went fox-hunting, and
during a couple of hectic days here he found time to
go riding at Glenelg, cast an eye on the polo at
Birkalla, and make a private inspection of the
Exhibition as a preliminary to declaring it well and
truly open.
Funds are still wanted for the Thornber memorial.
The sec. places it on grateful record that a. donation
has come from the remotest wilds of Queensland,
where The Bulletin had penetrated and the secre-
tarial circular hadn’t.
After a lapse of 30 years the United Service Lodge
of Freemasons —naval and military—-at Adelaide has
been revived, with Brig.-Gen. Price Weir as Master, and
several of Weir’s Gallipoli comrades are joining as
members. The lodge started with a great flourish
of trumpets in 1887, when the late General J.
Fletcher Owen was State Commandant, but there
weren’t enough military Masons to keep things
going, and it surrendered its warrant in 1895.
Acting Chief Justice Poole, as Grand Master o)
S. Aus. Freemasons, will lay the corner stone of
the Craft’s new Temple at Adelaide on April 15.
Masonic dignitaries from other States and M.L. will
foregather. Poole will be Administrator of the Gov-
ernment then.
Gov. Tom Bridges will unveil the Light Horse
Memorial on April 5. A few days later he trips off
to the Cold Country.

STOCKINGS
At the moment Sydney is in the condition
of the man who has just been sandbagged.
" herever the glance strays it encounters
stars. Four flashed across the vision within
2+ hours. Galli-Curci and Pauline Frederick
Jed the display, and when they had gracefully
rocketed into position at the Australia,
Stralia and Bessie Griffiths arrived flower-
laden from their triumphal progress through
the* South.
,Galli-Curci, who had jazzed nearly every
night. ;ph the trip over in the Ventura, lias
the physique of a dancer rather than of a
singer. Small and daintily formed she has a
step ' like thistledown, a brushed-from-tho-
forehead coiffure that is sleekly austere, and
full-lidded eyes from which leap a hundred
fires of emotion and sensibility. Looking into
those eyes you no longer wonder at this slip
of a thing’s mastery over her art and her
audiences. Only one party was staged in
her honor prior to her opening concert, and
that was the reception at the Australia on
the afternoon of her arrival. The affair,
though a happy enough gathering under the
shepherding of Mrs. George Taylor and Mrs.
Hyman, wasn’t notorious as a rally of either
Music or Sassiety. The Premier’s lady had
been got in to do the honors, and clothed her-
self in sable garments of distinction. Half
an hour after scheduled time the tiny guest of
honor fluttered from the lift, in sleek black
panne flounced with gorgeous lace of a deep
ivory tone, topped by a small hat with
ospreys. After the big handshake, the tea-
tables, enfolded in a pink mist of cactus
dahlias, lured all comers. On Galli-Curci’s
table glistened a golden ladder, over which she
was as naively charmed as a child. Also
she clapped loudly all the singers and musi-
cians in the afternoon’s programme. But
it wss ominous that she sent a message ex-
cusing herself from the Musical Associa-
tion’s party arranged for the following even-
ing.
Elsa Stralia and Bessie Griffiths being two
of Our Very Own, Sydney took them to its
heart, and during the week the billy boiled
over in a social hallelujah to them. The
day after their arrival the mayoral lady
opened her reception-rooms in their honor, and
saw nearly 200 guests wedged happily to-
gether. The reception turned out to be a
re-union of old friends, and the atmosphere
immediately got off its stilts and became
positively matey. For instance, three ex-
mayoresses, knight Richards’s lady, Mrs.
Lambert and Mrs. Fitz Gerald, revisited the
scene of their past glory, hobnobbing without
a qualm of regret. Songbird Stralia, in a
shimmer of gold against a bank of crimson
salvia and feathery cactus dahlias, was a
striking figure; and ’cellist Bessie Griffiths,
in spite of her demure black-and-white out-
fit, made one think of Meredith’s “dainty
rogue in porcelain,” though terra-cotta or
bronze would be a better medium to express
the warmer tones of Bessie’s coloring. The
Arundel Orchards and Gerald Walenn were,
among the first: on the, doormat, followed by
the De Cairos Rcgo family. Judge Back-
house looked in, and impressive Mrs. Monty
Severn dropped a few kind words into the
censer. The Feminist Club was represented
by Ruby Rich and an equally attractive sis-
ter. People from the Millions Club and the
Australia Preference League and the Musical
Association came in force, and in short the
two. brilliant musicans had a home-coming as
typically Australian as the gum-tips which
beautified the rooms.
The Feminists wove a handful of blooms
m the liomecomers’ garland on Friday. The
club’s new rooms were hectic with excitement
from an early hour, for this shivoo took the
form of a mid-day reception on the seventh
floor followed by a snack on the sixth. By
12.30 it looked as though every Feminist
in Sydney was heading for the club, and at
a quarter to one the crush was so great
you were lucky if you knew whether you
were standing on your own feet or the
woman’s next to you. Stralia, in frocking
the tone of golden sands, made with a loose
panel back and draped skirt, smiled over an
armful of pink blooms and under the pilot-
ing of knight Waley’s capable lady got
through the bewildering ordeal of greeting.
Which same remarks apply to Bessie Grif-
fiths. except for her frocking, which was
black georgettes cunningly outlined in Per-
sian reds.
Ear-rings were much worn at this party :
they ranged from art jewellery to the peari
beauties in the Waley lobes. Tall
Kirkpatrick was a good-looker, but the belle
of the party (if you exclude Manager Jack
Griffiths) was Mrs. England. The lady
wore black georgettes, distinguished by a
heavily-wrought bead design between
knee and waist. It was furthermore
embellished by a straight black cape of
the same softness dependent from a modi-
fied Elizabethan ruff over which the wearer’s
clean-cut chin emerged triumphantly. A
special cheer is due to president Miss Pres-
ton Stanley’s! speech of welcome to the
guests. It was at once poetic, sincere and
not a word too long.
The pocket-edition prima donna, Amelita
Galli-Curci, filled the Town Hall on Satur-
day night with one of the largest and most
mixed audiences the building has. ever
roofed. At 10 minutes past 8 a pair of the
tiniest silver shoes man has made moved
swiftly and lightly up the aisle from the
artists’ room, slid round the curve of tho
piano and brought their wearer to anchorage
in view of the waiting thousands, A souffle
of silver lace and tulle, her dress was the
sort we call a dream, the bill therefor being
generally a nightmare. It was blown to-
gether by some fairy Venetian glass-blower
in a moment of inspiration. Its long slim-
ness closely followed the slender lines of its
wearer, and on each side of the skirt poised
a cloud of silver tulle forming i trail of
glory to the singer’s exits and entrances. In
the sleek black hair brushed high off the
forehead ivas worn a high ivory comb of
large dimensions; the whole served with
diamonds and pearls and a small black book
of words. The' face is quite extraordinary,
all length and no breadth, the eyes full be-
low their weighted lids and (apparently)
plucked eyebrows, and the expression is at
once impulsive and controlled, nervous and
yet confident:. All the best Pointers and
the Complete Thrusters were present in
hordes. Lady de Chair, flashing with opales-
cent sequins, came with a party that in-
cluded General Tom Bridges, Governor of
South Aus., and his sister, who wore a black
frock and her brown hair in a Grecian knot
at'the nape of her neck. But the thrill came
after the two first numbers when Stralia, an
emerald cloak around her, rushed forward
and handed up to sister songbird an immense
laurel-wreath.
Vete r a n
critic (Jerald
Marr Thomp-
son had his
hour last
\v e e k w h e 11

ney crowded
to the ball-
room of the
Australia to
wish him and
Mrs. Thomp-
son a happy
voyage. The
two insepar-
ables leave for
England o n
the Moreton
Bay, and half
of the city
took the
chance to tell
the gentle
little man
how much they look forward to his return.
Brothers in crotchets Cairos Rego and
Paddy Nolan, with the Musical Association
and Bertie Kelly, had whipped up the func-
tion till it resembled a Roman victor’s
triumph. The ballroom was roseate with
feathery cactus dahlias, and pretty singing
and playing girds were present in hordes
flying tlieir newest hats for the event. Mrs.
Thompson, very smart in black tailorings,
made quite a neat little speech on her own
account, for Gerald Marr, obviously over-
come by the ovation, had as mucli as he
could do to speak for himself. A wallet
plump with over £2OO went with the com-
pany's good wishes. Nor was this the end.
Paris House, on the following day, housed a
“stag” lunch, acompanied by yet another
presentation. The picture that goes with
this shows Mrs. Thompson, who has be-
come almost as well known to concert-givers
as her husband.
Probably the greatest multitude Dawes
Point has known since the Old Battery
days gathered to see Minister for Works
Ball lay the foundation stone of the Sydney
Harbor Bridge. This he did with the help
of a crane, a man to mix the mortar and a
silver trowel. After the last pat of the
trowel the accessories before the act ran
for cover and left Mr. Ball in solitary
grandeur to the photographers. The Point
flew a merry design in bunting above its
forest of cranes and iron skeletons. It was
furthermore furnished with a many-tiered
wooden stand opposite a funnv little dais
on which sat the State Governor in full
naval kit and his Yice-reine. she looking a
stranger, having exchanged her usual leafy
millinery for a straight-fronted hat that
shone like Venetian glass in the sunshine.
On neighboring seats sat the Premier Fuller
couple, Dr. Bradfield, the Bell and Dorman
knights—these last suggesting in their frock
coats and grey stove pipes a couple of cor-
: ner men who might at any moment burst
into a song and dance. Dorman did trickle
into words, rather like a sieve that wants
to keep back more than it lets through,
after George Fuller and his colleague had
made two electioneering speeches on the heel
of the State Ex.’s address. Commander
Grant, in . blue and gold, and Captain
Coote, blushing above a most becoming
shade of brown, were there to see that
the vice-regal path was made straight.
Then, for all the world to see, a shining
silver casket engraved in waratahs and kan-
garoos and such flora was thrust upon Mr.
Ball. Somebody at the back called out:
“Lift it up and let’s see!” And even as
Mr. Ball replied “Come round and have
a look.” Sir Dudley picked up the casket
and held it aloft. Later on all partook of
a brew of champagne, and when the revels
were at their height, contractor Hugh Bell
handed over to Dr. Bradfield his souvenir
of the laying of the foundation stone.
On the same day as the Minister for Public
Works struggled titanically with the founda-
tion-stone of the bridge, Archbishop Kelly
got busy on the stone of Santa Sophia,
which will be the first college for R.C. girl
undergrads within the Uni. It will be next-
door neighbor to St. John’s, and is to cost
£81.200. Eight bishops spoke a blessing over
the chosen site, and the rectors of St. John’s
and St. Paul’s, the principal of St. An-
drew's. Mrs. Bennett (for the Master of
Wesley), and Miss Williams (principal of
the Women’s College) were at the function.
Hugh Denison's lady was a living demon-
stration of the eternal fitness of black at
the; cheerio given in her honor by the Vic-
toria Leaguers. Her up-to-the-minute frock
was in black Ottoman silk, and the outfit
ended on a crescendo of smartness in a
high-crowned black satin hat adorned with
a plumy tuft. The Premier Fuller matron,
who was the hostess, embellished her black
satin attire with onyx ornaments, remind-
ing one of a story told by Cyril Maude.
He was out walking one day in New Or-
leans and found himself and a raging thirst
in the negro quarter. Knocking at the door
of a shanty lie asked the shining row of
teeth and the ebony Smile that greeted him
for a drink of water. “Certainly, sail,”
said the lady; then, calling over her
shoulder: “Onyx, Onyx! Bring the gentle-
man a glass of water.” “That’s a very
unusual name,” said Maude. “I have heard
of Pearl and Ruby and Opal as girls’
names, but never Onyx.” The lady handed
him the water with an air. “Well, sah,
you see, it was this-a way. My husban’ wuz
three yeah at the wah, and while he wuz
away that-ali gal was born onyx-pected!”
The American Colony glad-handed Pauline
Frederick before she left for Melbourne, and
U.S. Consul Lawton’s wife introduced a
sharply-accented feminine multitude to the
pretty lady. The jollo was in the rearmost
corner of the Winter Garden because of
scaffolding in the annexe and Marr Thomp-
son in the ballroom. Mrs. Lawton had done
the thing in fine style, and crimson cactus
dahlias flamed in a long, long trail down a
dozen tables close together in the cosiest
manner. Pauline, ravishing in a black
redingote effect, with one of those new ex-
tinguisher hats in black satin pulled down
nearly to the bridge of her classic nose,
arrived under convoy of Mrs. “Snowy”
Baker. A miracle of tact and alertness, she
caught everybody’s name and remembered it.
She asked advice about having her shingle
repaired, and in a breath 20 different women
suggested 20 different barbers. But in the
end every woman was beaten from the field
by a young thing who urged the merits of
her particular hair-trimmer with the zeal of
the fanatic, finally demonstrating his merit
by pulling off her close-fitting bonnet and
displaying her sleek head in a fine frenzy
of enthusiasm.
Housed in Swain’s Gallery. Theo Cowan’s
show of water-colors attracted a lot of atten-
tion. Likewise it has been the port for
dozens of women, until on the last day it
had the air of a club rather than an art.
show. The,opening was quite a social flut-
ter, and knights and their ladies, Judges and
their associates (by marriage) and the
merely social butterflies found their way to
the show of the head hunters and their
native heath. Theo received first-day con-
gratulations in vellum-toned silk, to which
a picturesque black hat added charm. One
of the warmest admirers of the sculptor’s
new venture was B. E. Minns, president of
the Water Colorists; and Mon sign or King,
the R.C. cleric, who is critical in art mat-
ters, signified his feelings with a red tab.
Mrs. Walter Swinson was too ill to
hostess the party she had arranged at the
Queen’s Club to the glory of sister Bessie
Griffiths; so mother took the helm. Bessie
sparkled above black and red frocking, and
for headgear wore what appeared a viva-
cious design in red lacquer.
Helen Blaxland. daughter of the medical
Blaxlands, of Double Bay, said “I will” the
other night at All Saints’ to Lionel Rose,
whose father is Padre 11. .1. Rose, of Home-
hush. Canon Langley was the locksmith.
Gwen Brain ’maided, and Bernard Rose best-
manned. Tlie congratulations and toasts
were imbibed at the bride’s Double Bay
home, Warranong.
This gracious lady is Mrs. A. J. Thynue,
president of the YVomen’s Standing Com-
mittee of the YVomen’s College, Brisbane.
As Mrs. Leslie Corrie (she was formerly
married to a man of letters who was for
some years Mayor of Brisbane) she began,
when a bride,
to interest her-
self in philan-
thropic move-
ments in that
city. A fluent
speaker and
quick thinker,
she has done
much for many

bers, was to

she went on
to found the
W o m e n's
Electoral
League, of
which she was first president. She helped
to float the National Council of Women:
and the Crfeche and Kindergarten, the Social
Service Institute and the Lady Lamington
and Brisbane General hospitals have all to
thank her for services rendered. She com-
piled the “Red Cross Guide” during the Big
War, and worked hard for the Mutual Ser-
vice Club. The Scribblers’ Club and Arts
and Crafts now claim her spare moments.
She was born in Scotland, and lived much
iii Maoriland. One daughter is Mrs. Keith
Hall, who was married a short time before
her mother’s second marriage. Mrs. Thymic
has a beautiful home on Highgate Hill, with
a garden full of sweetness. Her husband
shares in his wife’s intellectual and philan-
thropic pursuits.
Elsa Stralia is out to beat Dot Brunton’s
£lOOO effort for the babies of St. Margaret’s.
She is organising a cabaret at the Ambassa-
dors early in April, when something new
in the way of a singing competition will be
heard.
Joseph Ward, one-time Premier of Maori-
land, has been hard hit by the epidemic of
infantile paralysis. Three grandchildren
(children of daughter Eileen, now Mrs.
Wood, of Christchurch) were attacked within
a fortnight. Two of the little sufferers died ;
the third is making a brave fight.
Miss Brisbane’s notes :—-
His Ex. patted the heads of the kiddies in the
Deaf, Dumb and Blind Institution on the 26th, and
listened to the committee’s tale of what it proposes
to do with the £4600 it hopes to get out of itt
present appeal to the public. A swimming pool
and pagoda, joy-wheels and other toys will lighten a
little the darkness of the youngsters. Elena Morth-
ram and C. F. Whitcombe are the architects.
Tlie lion. Bill Lennon will guard the vice-regal
interests while his Ex. takes a final survey of his
diocese.
Fine weather induced the ladies to make the War-
wick Turf Club’s annual meeting a well-decorated
show. Mrs. F. Margetts was sheathed in grey floral
crepe georgette ; delphinium blue draped Mrs. Barnes ;
and red was the hue of Mrs. E. A. Flower. An
equally exotic show was the ball that rounded Oft
the day.
Much tea bad to flow before Tessa Reading was
allowed to leave us for Westralia. Plnebe Kirwan,
assisted by Merita Gillies, staged one shivoo at the
Women’s Club; Jean Moore gave an amber and gold
party in Finney’s Roof Garden ; and Mrs. Sanderson
Taylor chose the Tea Kiosk in (lie Botanic Gardens
for her God-speed.
A pathetic story comes from Arrabury, near the
border of S.A. and Bananaland. A brown snake got
into young Robert Eastwood’s bed and bit him on
tlii' foot. His intrepid mother promptly scarified the
wound and started to drive her patient into the
head station. Three miles from her home she
found her son was dead, and alone in the desolate
silence she dug a grave and buried him. Next
day a snake was found, in her house, and was

SPORTING
NOTIONS
In the matter of showmanship Sydney
racing clubs have a lot to learn from music-hall
proprietors. The latter would ridicule the idea <>l
putting a star turn on first, which is what the Rose-
hill (N.S.W.) people did with Beauford when that
great favorite with Sydney crowds returned to the
business on Saturday. Beauford’s race was set down
for decision at the absurd time of five minutes
past one. As a result, many hundreds of people who
would have cheerfully dispensed with both divisions
of the two-year-old race, to say nothing of the divided
three-year-old handicap, a six-furlongs affair, missed
seeing him in action, and the betting machines
suffered accordingly. The old champion had lOst.
51b. in the first division of the Railway Handicap,
seven furlongs, and though palpably in need of a
few more gallops was made co-favorite with King
Carnival at 5 to 2. He left the barrier smartly,
led. at three furlongs and was still in front at the
distance, but there Valiant (9 to 2) tackled him, and,
weight and condition telling on the Newcastle horse,
went on to win by a length and a quarter, with
King Carnival three-quarters of a length behind
Beauford, whom he had trailed most of the way, and
Stony a fair fourth. Valiant, who has fined down
since he went to Victoria, carried Bst. 71b., 41b. more
than his Doncaster weight, and must be accorded a
chance on Easter Saturday, although his attempts
to get a mile in good company at Randwick have
not hitherto been encouraging. Still the same might
have been said of Blackadder before the latter came
good last year.
Valiard (6 to 4 on) let his backers down badly in the
second division, for which his weight was Bst. 131 b.,
the ’same as in the Doncaster. Jolly Handsome, a
neat bit of stuff from Westralia, made the pace for
half a mile or so; then Encre (B’s), David’s half-
sister, took command, and, making a holy show of
Valiard, beat. him home by four lengths, Royal
Digliton—still a bit on the big side, though he
seemed to be genuinely backed —being three-quarters
of a length behind Valiard and clear of Wallace Arm-
strong and Valdoona, who is nearly right again.
On this form Valiard may be dismissed from Doncaster
calculations, for Encre will meet him on 51b. better
terms; and there are other reasons. The mare
galloped the seven furlongs in lmin. 25Asec., |sec.
slower than Valiant’s time.
The Hawk (9 to 4 on) came to the rescue of the
big punters in the w.f.a. Rawson Stakes, in which
the nine furlongs were run in lmin. 51ijsee., a course
record. But it took him all his time to beat
Whittier (?o’s), who tried to win all the way and
only failed by a neck after a gallant struggle. The
A.J.C. hanlicapper must have looked very thoughtful
when Polycletan, with Bst. 131 b. up, ran past horses
that will be giving him lumps of weight in the
Doncaster or the Sydney Cup, to finish within a
length and a half of The Hawk. There was daylight
between this much under-rated horse and the fourth
pair, Windbag and Mountain Song, and behind the
three-year-olds were All Sunshine, a very fit horse *
Cliffdale, Wallace Mortlake (very prominent for a
mile), David and Lilypond, with Virgin Gold last.
Lilypond looked rather light on it, and that 9st. is
goiug to trouble him in the Cup.
In this page’s opinion Toohey made rather too
much use of Whittier in the Rawson Stakes, whereas
Dike rode The Hawk like the artist he is at his best.
But Toohey’s turn came after McShortodds had
replenished his bag by the successes of Royal Attend-
ant (10’s) in the first division of the Juvenile Handi-
cap and Vice-Regal (B’s) in the second division, the
favorite having in each case (Bravery in the one and
Vaals in the other) lost its chance at the start.
Royal RouC> (9 to 2) was first home in the Club
Handicap, 12 furlongs, but Meenah (3’s) got the
race on a protest. Rightly so, because Royal Rou6
palpably interfered with Toohey’s mount in the run
home, but the Gadabout—Vira gelding, who was
driven to the front from the start, must have lost
many lengths by leaving the rails, after entering
the straight, and finishing near the grandstand fence,
and it was tough luck for J. M. C. Forsayth, who
threw in for a good win. Prince Minimbah was
placed third and Houdini fourth, while Accarak, the
favorite, was close up. O’Connor. Royal Roud’s rider,
turned the tables on Toohey in the first division
of the Three-vear-old Handicap, iu which Persse’s
Double (2’s), from Queensland like the jockey, had a
shade the better of an exciting finish with Troth,
ridden by the Rosehill horseman, Chateau Tanunda
and lvenmare, there being only heads between them.
Then Toohey got Peri woo (2’s) home in the second
division, and finished the day in a blaze of glory
by guiding Lausanne (0 to 4) to an impressive
victory in the Parramatta Mile, notwithstanding a
big weight (9st. 131 b.), a bad marble and 22 other
starters. The Valais —Courante colt, now in W.
Kelso’s stable, is a thorough gentleman in appearance,
and though he had nothing much to beat (Riga was
second and L.A. third) he won in smashing style.
He will be a taking Doncaster proposition with 7st.
91b. if he keeps right.

The A.J.C. should get a great crowd of

“ What’s Mrs. Smith’s handicap?”
“Smith.'’
for a Sydney suburban meeting. Beauford, who
pulled up well after his Rosehill race, is likely to
have a cut at the Liverpool Handicap, in which he
has lOst. 71b. It is not an extravagant weight, and
the distance (six furlongs) will suit him, but it is
doubtful whether he can concede a stone to Brae-
head, who is receiving a special preparation under
Dick O’Connor’s care. Perhaps Braehead will do
the trick, and Kilkenny Lass (7st. 111 b.) has a
rough chance. For the Autumn Cup, 12 furlongs
Polycletan (Bst. 91b., including a 71b. penalty) will
be favorite if he starts, and in that case he will
be this writer’s choice. Should he be withdrawn
the winner may come from Windbag (Bst.), Royal
Dighton (7st. 91b.), Confusion (7st. 41b.), Solidify
(7st. 31b.) and Royal RouC* (7st.), and possibly
Royal Dighton will prove the best tote bet. He may
not be quite at his top, but his Rosehill gallop must
have brought him on; and he has shown that he
can get a prominent position early—it will be use-
ful at the Farm —-and run out a good mile and a
half. In the 1 0-furlongs Chipping Norton Stakes,
w.f.a., with penalties, Whittier will have to shift
101 b. more than the 9st. 21b. he carried at Rose-
hill and concede The Hawk the same 31b.—in the
Doncaster The Hawk has lOst. slb. and Whittier
9st. 101 b. There is not much between the pair, but
Whittier seems the more likely to improve on
Rawscn Stakes form —he manifestly needed the race—
and to be at home in the short straight, for which
reasons he is selected to beat The Hawk and Heroic
(9st. 41b.) too, if that boomed chestnut is produced.
* * « *
Melbourne followers of the game haven’t
forgotten Last Drop’s meritorious second in the
V.R.C. Standish Handicap, and there was good
money for the Blague—Flash mare at 7’s (it was
6 to 1 the feeyuld) in the Open Handicap at Men-
tone. Last Drop was in front all the way, but she
was stopping at the end, just as her sire used to
stop, and Pluto (12’s) would have beaten her in a
few more strides. Reid tried a new way of hand-
ling Graball (fi’s), a remarkable track galloper, in
the Mentone Handicap. Instead of letting the
Pendil—Linrose gelding rush away with the lead,
which method hasn’t been startlingly successful, the
M.L. jockey kept him well behind, and his finish
had a sparkle in it —certainly he travelled too fast
for Demades and Gay Serenades Oile of the beaten
division was the KetliUvorth gelding Answer* who
has done nothing since his surprise win (a fluke it
now appears to have been) in the Australian Cup.
“Hasen”: There are some queer happenings that
never come to inquiry. In a Mentone sprint, a horse
that on paper and "performances should have been
easily favorite, after opening momentarily in that
position, quickly receded quite a hiunber of points.
Since it was a big field the likely reason seenled to
be the drawing of a bad marble, but posting of the
numbers showed that it had an excellent position
at the barrier, t watched that start with glasses
rather carefully. The horse ill question didn’t play
up. In the ordinary way of the line-up it was walked
out and back several times, and each time it finished
on the outside of a few more horses. Not once
did the boy attempt to regain tin* position originally
drawn. Finally it started from somewhere well out
toward the middle of the field. There may be a
perfectly good explanation of this, but it seems to
me no more reasonable to censure a boy, as is
frequently done, for trying to hotter an unfavorable
position than for losing, without an effort to prevent,
it, a favorable one.
* » * *
“Chiron”: The unregistered meetings at
Richmond (Tas.), held about this time of the year*
are generally worth going to see* but it is not
advisable to bet Unless yoU know something. Ailti
then you mustn't believe ull you are told. Local
punters have a great respect for any horse with an
aroma Of suspicion about it. At cne ' particular
meeting a grey supposed to be a ringtail was backed
so profusely that lie would have returned 11s. (3d.
for 10s. had he won. In a later race another grey
with the same name rolled home by many lengths,
despite his jockey’s heroic efforts to make a close
finish of it; the dividend in that caBC was CO. In
more primitive days the judge gave a Verdict which
sent the crowd mad, and an Infuriated dame pelted
the winning jockey with stotles and gravel to
prevent his Weighing in. The maiinikirt persisting,
she charged him with her Umbrella, the crowd
cheering tumultuously the while. The judge’s deci-
sion was reversed at a hastily assembled Caucus
of stewards, and the matron collected.
“Centurion”: There is little doubt that we
moderns lift the weight of fiatlipg years. Even a
Rugby League football
final could not offer a
fed-bloodecl equivalent
to the pleasant aftet-
noou forecasted in the
subjoined copy *of a
sporting handbill dated
Anzac Day, or, to be
exact, April 25, 1702.
It is doubtful, too,
if our finest movie
advertisement writers
could set out such ail
anticipatory thriller:
“At the Bear Gar-
din, Hockley in the
Hole. These arc to
give notice to all
gentlemen, gamesters
and others that on this
present Monday a great
match is to be fought
by a bald-faced Dog
of Middlesex against a
fellow Dog of Cow
Cross for a Guinea
each Dog, five let-
goes out of hand,
which goes fairest
and furthest wins all.
Also a great mad Bull
is to be turned loose
in the Game-place,
with Fireworks all
over him, and two or
three Cats ty’d to his
tail and Dogs after
them. Also other
variety of Bull-baiting
and Bear-baiting. Be-
ginning at two of the
Clock.” Note the dis-
tinction then drawn
between “gentlemen”
and “gamesters” ; these
last, presumably, the
equivalent of our “sports” as opposed to “sportsmen.”
Despite all the interest it evokes, and the
training it necessitates, and the hero-worship it gives
scope for, the Oxford and Cambridge boat race is
mqre often than not a rather dull and stodgy affair,
as any race over four miles is likely to be. Still
there are thrills and out-of-the-way happenings some-
times, as in the dead-heat year of ’77 due to the Oxford
bow damaging his oar, and the catastrophe of 'B7,
when an Oxonian (McLean) broke his oar, and the
memorable struggle of ’l2, -when both boats sank in
the disturbed river and the race had to be re-rowed.
Something similar happened last Saturday, except
that, only one crew was affected. The Oxford boat
became waterlogged before much more than half
of the course had been rowed, and that was the end
of the race. According to some of the critics Oxford
lost the race when its captain lost the toss and
had to take the turbulent side of Father Thames.
If this is so, albeit Cambridge were almost certainly
the better crew, it looks as if the spin of the coin
may have as much to do with the result of a boat
race as a Test match, or even a little more when
the elements are asserting thenvelves.
South Aus. tennis was obviously over-
weighted in taking ori Vic. and N.S.W. at the same
time, and got two bad lickings. The only point of
interest was that Patterson unexpectedly lost to
Hone, 4—6, 3—6. The Victorian’s ankle seemed
to trouble him, and he took things easily. He beat
Rowe, the other local star, and O’Hara Wood beat
both of them. In the championship tournament
which followed, Patterson and Hone were both
knocked out, the latter by Rowe, the former by
Cummings (N.S.W.), after five sets in each case.
It took another hard-fought five-set match for O’Hara
Wood to dispose of Cummings, who is unquestion-
ably a comer; and the final, between O’Hara Wood
and Schlesinger, who eliminated Rowe rather easily,
was equally strenuous. Wood losing the first two
sets and winning the last three. His form was
much sounder than he showed in Melbourne. Pat-
terson and Hone overcame O’Hara Wood and T. K.
Fitchett in the doubles; apd Miss Boyd, who is
going to Europe with Miss Daphne Akhurst and Mrs.
Harper, was victorious in the women’s singles and
doubles, the latter with Mrs, O’Hara Wood.
Bon*. Martin (9st. IMb.) fulfilled expecta-
tions prompted by his showing in previous fights
that he would beat Bert Spargo (9st. 41b.) at the
Melbourne Stadium. But the Spargo of 1922 would
have made mincemeat of the Martin of Saturday
night’s affair. There was a spasm of excitement
in the eighteenth round, when a speculative light
knocked Martin to the canvas. Apart from that it
was a drab contest, with Martin always the winnei
on points.
* « * *
With onlv one round to go, University,
Waverley and Sydney (20 points) are leading for the
Sydney cricket premiership, Manly being a point
away. Sydilev looked hopelessly out of it a few
weeks ago, but a fine four-point win over North
Sydney put them in the running again. Asher,
11 for 90, was a great factor in their innings defeat
of the North Siders. Always a great collector of
wickets, although the selectors never seem to notice
it, he has this year taken 61, averaging 16.27. The
irony of the situation is that Sydney are to be
excluded from the competition next year, the Associa-
tion having pronounced what is equivalent to the
club's death-sentence. IC. Taylor, a colt with Western
Suburbs, batted splendidly for 105 not out v. Waver-
ley. Ho should be heard of again,
* * * *
There were varied degrees of vetetanship
in a team lately led by Clem Hill against a strong
suburban XI in Adelaide. Hill himself made 76,
Travers 28 not out and took two wickets for 31.
These are still active, (ioorge Giffen, at 64 or 66
(he has challenged the latter accepted age, and
thus appears to have been a member of a premier
club team at 14 and an inter-State man at 16), is
showing tile flight of time, hut he took 8 for 23,
A whole cricket g( iteration older Is AV, 0, Higgin-
bottom, in lioiior of whose 80th birthday the match
was played. He is still active in suburban matches,
mu! on this occasion ids Underhand lobs bagged
2 for 33.
« * # *
“Tim Deacon”: Old as lie is. Bill Howell,
the ex-intemationai, can still bowl a bit. In the
Nepean (N.S.AV.) district this season, Bill has taken
just ioo wickets, averaging a shade over 5.
The veteratl is a good advertisement for the Tteeha-
bites—he has been a teetotaller all his life.
* * * *
“Shrewsbury” l The Fates pursued QilH-
gatt’s cricketers even to the remotest western rim of
the continent, .lust before they sailed, an XI of
the visitors took on a Westraliaii side at Soccer and
were soundly walloped by 6 —3. This though Patsv
Hendren is an international and Whysall and Gilligaii
are both county “reps.*’
* * * #
“11. Ilardupp”: Melbourne will open its
football season in ail atmosphere of bitterness. The
ruptdre between the League and the Association has
brought back the old inter-code bargaining, which
(lie agreement checked, and the Association has re-
fused to give clearances to the members of the three
clubs taken over by the League, Some of those
players wilt certainly stay with the Association.
Getting on in years, they realise that they might before
long be discarded by the new League clubs, and if they
disqualified themselves for Association ’ball by going
over without clearances they would be unable to
fall back oil the 30-bob-a-week they are likely to
draw as Association players. Again, League clubs
are fighting amongst themselves like eats in a bag.
Clearances are being refused by some clubs in a most
peronintory fashion, and disgruntled players are being
forced to stay in their old district or else not play
at all. Altogether, there are entrancing prospects
ahead for those who like their football vicious and
count a Saturday afternoon ill-spent unless they
have seen at least three leather-chasers laid out.
“G. 0.8.”: Touching this trafficking in footballers.
Stewart McLatchie, a clever rover, intent on earning
a few more bob than Carlton can give him, applied
for and captured the coachship of Coburg, the new
Association team. Then he resigned, giving as his
reason that he did not have time to do the job
properly. During the next couple of days, McLatchie,
Charlie Hardy and a host of others were beaten, by
Gordon Rattray, for the more lucrative position of
playing mentor at North Melbourne; and now Mc-
Latchie is without a job and Coburg is without a
coach. Ratts., who had previously left Fitzroy with-
out a permit to go to Melbourne, just as promptly
threw in his new North guernsey to take up a better
post at Brighton. Trebilco, of Carlton, has moved
over to Northeote; Harry Smith and Johnston,
’Cote’s brightest stars, are with Melbourne and Gee-
long respectively; “Chook” Howell, formerly of
Stoush Melbourne and Footsrray. is at Prahran; and
many other players have their bags packed in antici-
pation of adequate temptations coming their way.
* * » *
“Shrewsbury”: The N.S.W. Rugby
League, which has sourly refused the Soccer people
the use of Sydney C. G. for even one match against
the Britons, has declared a profit of £254
on last year’s operations, which included a visit from
an English team. Receipts were £17,287 10s. 7d.
and expenditure £17,033 2s. 10d. ; of this last,
players’ “allowances” took £1974 14s. 2d. A
standing credit of £6839 brought forward
from the 1923 season makes a total credit of
£7093. Teams will come this year from
Queensland and Maoriland, and if the Maorilander-
show no better form than they did on their last
visit there will be a mighty slump in the attendance
after the first match. But it is alleged that they
will include some of the returned All Blacks. The
Rugby Unitn, which is making good headway again,
converter] an overdraft of £950 into a credit balance
of £ll2O.
Tommy Lawton. Queensland Rhodes
Scholar and Rugger footballer, came back to Aus-
tralia the other day to farm in the Northern State.
It was round his rufous poll that the lightnings
of amateurism played two or three years ago. when,
after he had made his debut in Oxford football, it
was found that he had played the “professional
League game with Brisbane Uni. Several prominent
English Rugger potentates took to their bed* on
hearing the news ; but the two facts that Lawton was
only technieallv a pro, and that Oxford read.'
needed a high-class stand-off half, saved the day. He
is going to play League again in Queensland, and The
Bulletin experts any day to hear that he has been
excommunicated by the Archbishop of Canterbury-
or whoever handles these jobs for the English Rugby
Union.
THE EVERLASTING LOSER.
[For The Bulletin.]
“Gooseflesh was the only winning favorite, but
probably the success of Cadger, Bivalve, Chilled
Beef, White Rabbit and Foxtrot caused the majority
of the bookmakers to show a loss on the day’s trans-
actions.” —Sporting paper.
It’s tough on Britain’s unemployed who stand in line
for doles,
It’s rough upon the squatter in the drought,
Pom - devils of insolvents come before the courts in
shoals,
And broken men shove tickers up the spout.
There's few of us don't speculate in more or less
degree,
And it’s sad to see the oof bird flit away;
But what are the misfortunes of chaps like you and
me
Compared with Ikey’s “losses on the day” ?
His foot is on his native heath, and in his bag
the wads,
There’s never of despondency a trace
in the penciller’s demeanor as lie gaily yells the
odds
With Chesterfieldian courtesy and grace.
A dozen horses saddle up. His generous heart
expands
And odds of six to four he’ll freely lay
Against the pick of them —though sometimes evens
he demands—
And even then he “loses on the day.”
There’s but a single favorite comes home with easy
stride,
The others mostly finish in the ruck;
But you’ll always hear the bookie to the sporting
scribe confide
The gloomy information he’s been “struck.”
And the sympathetic pressman, sorrowing for the
ringman’s plight,
Hurries office-ward his knowledge to display,
Recording for the hundredth time in screaming black
and white
How poor McShortodds “lost upon the day.”
A prad goes out at fifties —Ikey hasn’t scratched
his name—
And canters home, as roughies sometimes do.
“I’ll pay Gone Bung” they’re shouting, but no-one
comes to claim,
’Tis a skinner for the ringmen entre nous.
There’s many a pudgy hand bedecked with flashing
diamond rings,
There’s many a launch that chugs about the bay,
In fact it’s possible to buy no end of sumptuous
things
Out of lkey Moses’ “losses on the day.”

This Free Test
Will amaze and delight you
This offers you a io-day test, to show the
way to prettier teeth. To cleaner, safer
teeth. Millions now employ it. You see the
results in whiter teeth wherever you look
to-day. Now find out, for your own sake,
what that way means to you.
Film —the great enemy
Dingy teeth and most tooth troubles
come from film. From that viscous film you
feel. Soon that film discolors. Then it
forms dingy coats, and white teeth lose
their lustre.
Film also holds food substance which
ferments and forms acid. It holds the acid
in contact with the teeth to cause decay.
Very few people who brush teeth in old
ways escape those film-caused troubles.
Protect the Enamel
Pcpsodcnt disintegrates the film,
then removes it with an agent far
softer than enamel. Never use a
film combatant which contains
harsh grit.

How to combat it
Dental science, after long research, has
found ways to fight that film. One acts to
disintegrate the film at all stages of forma-
tion. The other removes it without harm-
ful scouring. A new-type tooth paste has
been created to apply those methods daily.
The name is Pepsodent. Now leading den-
tists the world over advise it, and careful
people of some 50 nations enjoy its benefits.
A new dental era
In other ways Pepsodent is bringing a

THE INKY WAY.
Adelaide Register celebrated last week the 80th
birthday of C. H. Franklin, who has been in the
office for 664 years, and is still in charge of the
advertisement section in the lino. room. He claims
to have missed not more than two months from
ill-health in the whole period.
Melbourne Age lost an elderly inhabitant when old
Peter Milledge died lately—he had been in the
composing-room for 52 years. But he was not the
oldest inhabitant. “Pa” Hewitt has been 54 years
in the same room, and reckons that he will fix
up many formes before lie thinks about his old-age
holiday.
“Amyl”: I have always been puzzled over the origin
of the Digger term “jake” and its elaborations
“jakerloo” and “jakerlooski.” The Bakerloo under-
ground circuit of London may have had something
to do with the evolution of the second word, and the
penultimate “ski” was employed to give any slang
term a Russian flavor; but where did the original
“jake” come from ? All three words are merely
synonymns for “all right.”
One of the. earliest and best Labor journalists in
Australia died a few days ago in Adelaide —Charles
Malev, headmaster of the Algate State School
and president of the S.A. Teachers’ Union. After
being in charge of some of the largest schools
in S. Aus. Maley became deeply attached to the
Labor party, left the service, and, crossing over
to Broken Hill, edited the little Labor paper which
had been founded there. He did much fine social
work in Broken Hill; but was too philosophical
to be warmly embraced by the younger Laborites,
and presently returned to the S.A. Education Depart-
ment.
Amongst picturesque public announcements one
which appeared amongst the “Public Notices” of the
S.M. Herald of February 8, 1861, deserves remember-
ance. Here it is, without a letter altered: —
“Where are you now, Richard Kelly ? In the year
forty-one its in the Queen’s County you war. Your
wedded sister Ann Morris nearly washed the eyes
out of her head searching for you. She lives with
her fine family at Mount William, Port Phillip, and
its sore her heart is that you don't spake. If the
gentlemen who make the newspapers were to mintion
it, Richard lived, soon the poor girl wud hear from
you. So she would.” ■
“Wink”; I have a complete file of the Kia-Ora
Coo-ee, the Diggers’ periodical of the Palestine front
(B. 26/2/’25), and an excellent journal it was—
to send to the family in Aussie. But it had too
little of the true barrack-room atmosphere to be an
eagerly awaited trench paper. For this deficiency
Charlie Barratt was blamed, as the boys believed that
his co-editor, Frank Reid, would have made it full-
flavored and really popular. Still it had its bright
spots. There was the ribald tale of a Digger who
stumbled on an Arab mansion as the household was
praying that the married daughter might be blessed
with a son. Nugget introduced himself, was hospit-
ably entertained, and spent a pleasant afternoon with
some of the younger ladies of the household before
returning to the lines. Many months afterwards he
found himself again in the Sheik’s neighborhood and
politely called to inquire “Has your daughter received
the blessing of the gods?” “They answered my
prayer this morning,” the old chap replied, “but the
idiots gave the boy to the wrong daughter.”
“Wynton”: Died in Perth the other day, J. C.
Morrison, a Ballarat native, ex-leader writer of the
West Australian, and for many years a prominent
figure on the local Inky Way. A facile pen, made the
more effective by a full equipment of general know-
ledge first brought him into prominence on W.A.’s
eastern goldfields. Thence he gravitated to the
metropolis, and some 14 years ago became leader-
writer on the morning daily. He was equally at
home whether firing broadsides from the editorial
columns or presenting the tears and smiles of human
interest, but his pet subject was statecraft. His
style was clear, his argument well developed, and he
possessed a fund of biting satire which made him a
dangerous critic. Personally he was dogmatic and
egotistical, but withal a good fellow. A little rumpus
in the West’s holy of holies about 18 months ago
resulted in Morrison resigning. For a time he edited
the Leader, a mushroom weekly, and then founded
the Freelance, another weekly, which was on the
up-grade when the gong went. His death was sudden
and unexpected ; he had reached only the 48tli mile-
stone.
“W.11.E.”: Probably the first Labor paper pub-
lished in the Commonwealth was printed in a dilapi-
dated old weatherboard building in Park-street
where the Criterion Theatre now stands. In 1873
three employees of the S. M. Herald severed their
long record on that paper and helped lay the foun-
dation of the Labor movemint. “.Jack” Hyde
and Fred. Shettle were two of the Herald’s hand-
setting comps (the linotype was not then thought
of), and “Christie” Moore was in charge of the
machine-room. With limited capital and much
optimism they published weekly The U orkman a
breezv eight-page demy folio. It was edited by the
versatile Jim O’Neill, who had long been on the
staff of the Illustrated Sydney News, then pub-
lished bv Gibbs, Shallard and Co., whose premises
were in Pitt-street about the present site of Vickery’s
Chambers. Harold Grey, a cynical humorist, was
responsible for most of the “copy” that wasn t
political. The Workman struggled with adversity
before passing out, but it lived long enough to
galvanise the moribun 1 Trades and Labor Council,
which later on culminated in the present-day Labor
party. Strange to say these early pioneers of the
Labor Movement did not seek the limelight in press
or on platform, and it is questionable if their early
efforts in the interests of Democracy (or even their
names) are remembered.
“Bodleian”: The death of John Lane, publisher, of
the Bodley Head, has a personal interest to some
Australian scribblers, for John launched a few of
their little argosies, though, so far as I am aware,
no golden fleeces reached this part of the world.
John was a plausible and an optimistic correspondent.
It was always “the next will arrive”; and as he
bound down the author to give the next to him, the
system kept the former in a sort of literary servitude.
“When a publisher takes up a novelist,” John wrote,
“he does so on the principle that when the novelist
‘arrives’ he (the publisher) will reap the reward
of his enterprise. It sometimes happens that novel
after novel results in financial loss, but then there
comes a time when the public awakens to the merits
of the novelist and justifies the publisher. Then it
is that the publisher has an opportunity of recouping
himself.” In the meantime, other firms, attracted by
these novels passing through the Bodleian mill,
approached their authors ; but John stood like a lion
in the way. Doubtless there were tricks and artifices
by which the bond could be avoided, but publishers,
like other business folk, hang together and look
askance at such suggestions. “I must stipulate for the
offer of your next two novels, if you write two more,”
he wrote again, and added the cold comfort: “I do
not make it incumbent on you to write novels. I
merely say that, if you do write novels, they shall
first lie offered to me.” The would-be novelist had
been prepared to sign anything to compass the
publication of his first book; but as the publisher
paid no royalty on this till at least (or so it used
to be) a thousand copies had been sold in England,
irrespective of what were sold elsewhere, he attacked
No. 2 novel in a less optimistic spirit. And so it
went on —John always laudatory, always optimistic
and John’s cheques always small. “There is one
important fact against your immediate success,”
wrote the good John in a P.S., “the fact that, you
are not personally known to your critics or public in
this country. Believe me the personal element stands
for a good” deal —in this country, at any rate. Of
course this difficulty you will undoubtedly overcome
in time by your splendid work. Please remember
also that Anthony Hope wrote eight or nine books
before he got any position at all.” Again the old
man wrote: “I hope that you are not becoming
discouraged. The path of the novelist is a thorny
one, and it is only persistency and good work that
will gain for him the public of his dreams.” He
then enclosed the cheque of reality—which was cal-
culated to arouse envy of the lot of the wharf-laborer.
Still one could not be angry with John. He bound
vou in chains of iron pnd fed von on scant tare,
but never let the lamp of hope flicker out.

COMPETITION
From 46,285 suggestions we have
chosen REX-PYE. The following sent
in this name, and*, in accordance with
Condition 7 of the Competition, they
divide the £lOO prize money. Bank j
drafts have been posted to:—
You ask for “Camp Pie,” expecting
to get the Foggitt Jones Rex Camp
Pie. It is a natural expectation; for
we have made the name famous
throughout Australasia. The name is
famous because you have found Rex
Camp Pie, made from a recipe solely
in our possession, to be of dependable,
excellent quality.
But there is a risk of your being given
imitations, cheaper in price like most
imitations, but decidedly not REX
CAMP PIE.
To ensure that you get the genuine
article you have in your mind when
you order, and to protect you fully
from imitations, we have decided to
change the name.
In the meantime, say “Foggitt Jones 5
Rex Camp Pie.”

When you travel
You’ll find that favourite hotels
in Australia and New Zealand
furnish the favourite toilet soap
From Brisbane or Sydney to Mel-
bourne —from Adelaide to Pertl
from Auckland or Wellington to
Christchurch and Dunedin.
Travelling Australians find at the
most popular hotels the country's
most popular toilet soap. Where
you find exceptional service, ex-
ceptional attention to your com-
fort —there you find Palmolive.
Where you find Palmolive —there
you are apt to find every detail of
hotel service to be excellent.
Next time you travel, check up on
this. Check up on it now, from
memory of your latest trip.
Proof Right Here.
On this page are photographs of
twenty-one hotels. They are lead-
ing hotels in their sections of
Australia and New Zealand. Per-
haps you have been a guest in one
or more of them.
In every one shown, Palmolive is
furnished. And in hundreds more,
for which there is not space to
show pictures here.
It is further proof of the tremen-
dous popularity Palmolive has
won —and holds.
Why so many prefer it.
The owners and managers of these
fine hotels do nor guess about even
the smallest details of service—
upon which they depend for suc-
cess. They know that people
prefer, demand, and use Palmolive
at home. They know that it is
the toilet soap favoured by most
women and most men.
Because it is a pure, scientific
blend of rare palm and olive oils,
perfectly saponified.
Because it is an unusually thorough
cleanser —yet mild, gentle, lotion-
like.
They buy it for the use of guests
because it is their policy to provide
the best of everything. Just as
they provide excellent foods. Just
as they insist upon courteous, in-
telligent employees. Just as they
provide fine linens, good furnish-
ings and appointments.
The famous “ little ” cakes.
For use in hotels, Palmolive is sup-
plied in “ individual cakes." They
are of exactly the same pure, mild
soap that is found in the famous
full-size cakes of general use. But
smaller in size. They are wrapped
in the Palmolive green wrapper—
which usually carries the hotel
imprint.
If you have a favourite hotel at
which Palmolive is not yet being
furnished, a word to the manager
will secure this extra comfort for
future visits.

Do we blame tlie lark that in addition to
his swelling song lie lias not the carrying
capacity of the aeroplane? Then why blame
Galli-Curci for not possessing in her voice
those qualities whose very absence lias made
her the most dizzying coloratura of her day?
The voice (smaller in volume than it records
for the gramophone), too ethereal, too thistle-
down light for human nature’s daily emo-
tions, has the sweetness of a night wind
blown through jasmine, and though empty
of warmth as moonbeams, it yet possesses all
their silvery glamor. The opening pro-
gramme on Saturday night at Sydney Town
l-lall was made up of numbers that dazzle
the fancy rather than tear the heart-strings;
but, again, those are the works to which the
singer’s vehicle is most suited. So when the
singer rippled and shone in the Polonaise
from “Mignon” you saw not only Titania but
Peaspod and Cobweb and Mustardseed, and
grasses heavy with dew—it was fairy stuff.
The flickering, will-o’-the-wisp Shadow Song
from “Dinorah” was another of the night’s
big moments; and though occasionally the
voice shrilled, there was a complete absence
of harshness. The high voltage “Spanish
Carnations,” by Valverde, taken at extraor-
dinary speed, captured the entire house, and
had to be repeated, the little singer, for the
encore, turning her back on the front seaters,
and giving those on the platform seats the
full benefit of the extraordinary agility and
volubility with which she treated the num-
ber. To Bishop’s “Pretty Mocking Bird”
the flautist, Manuel Berenguer, added, as in
the Shadow Song, the notes of his golden
pipe; in this number the artist trilled and
shook as in the Shadow Song in a very
ecstasy of suave sounds. Staub’s “LTlenre
Silcncieuse,” and an exquisite little poem,
“Pierrot,” whose music is by the songbird’s
husband, Homer Samuels, were other delicate
moments in a programme that opened with
two old Italian compositions, “Deli pin a
me,” by Bononcini, and “Se tu m’ami” from
the pen of Pergolese. But it was a pity
that for her final encore Galli-Curci fell into
the trap and sang “Home, Sweet Home.”
The words of this old stand-by are so banal
that it requires genuine emotion on the part
“TANGERINE" AT SYDNEY GRAND
OPERA HOUSE.

and May Beatty as Kate Allen.
of the singer to awaken response in her audi-
ence. Mr. Samuels played his wife’s accom-
paniments with a sympathy that shows long
partnership, and an insight that proves the
musician. The flute solos were a feature of
the second part of the programme, and in-
Gluck’s “Sacred Dance,” from “Or-
pheus,” and a rather thin composition by
Samuels. To-night, Saturday and on Mon-
day and Wednesday of next week there will
be further concerts.
s*: 3: 3:
Mark Daly is both acts and the curtain
of “Tangerine,” “a musical satire of the
sexes,” which floated off at Sydney Opera
House on Saturday. Really it is burdened
with very little music and nothing so dis-
quieting as satire, but it is loaded to the
plimsoll with the sexes—including Clarence,
who is of the neuter gender—and heaped
high with cheerful humor. Commencing in
a prison in New York for divorced husbands
who cannot or will not pay their wives’
alimony, the play is transported to a South
Sea island, where tha separated couples
find a social system in which women do the
work and the men sit round and knit.
Their arrival before the scenery has been
quite knocked into shape gives opportunity
for some sentimental singing by Mamie
Watson and Leyland Hodgson, and some
song and dance by Madge Roberts and
others; after which the influence of the
tropic afternoon makes song and dance the
order of the day, and the plot is tacitly mis-
laid. Its sudden re-discovery towards the
end, to give Mamie and Leyland a further
opportunity to resurrect their romantic
feelings, isn’t so disconcerting as to spoil
the fun.
* * * #
Daly, as the King of Tangerine, dis-
closed himself once more to be a comedian
of merit, who is not content to fire away his
boxful of aphorisms made in U.S.A. with
the customary grin and caper, but charges
them with a personality made at home,
lie is ably seconded by May Beatty, who
knows a good deal more about make-up, has
wider inflections in her voice, and more
variety in her acting than most of the star-
ring flappers of to-day, who will doubtless
learn in time. Of the divorced husbands.
Ireland Cutter is casual and amusing, and
knits with expedition and despatch. Mamie
Watson hasn’t more voice than her part
demands, but she has a nice high kick.
Good dancing and light singing distinguish
nearly all the rest.

Criterion, knew some tricks that A. A. Milne
forgot when he wrote “The Truth About
Blayds.” Both plays move around the
divulging of a guilty secret that wrecks the
little cosmos of a good but vain domestic
tyrant; but Pinero did not allow the adultery
of the dear dead-and-gone Annabel to emerge
until the evening was drawing to its close,
and then he had plenty of action in reserve
to keep the tiling uplifted to its final touch-
ing climax. Lacking the action Milne-’s
brilliant persiflage failed to hold the inter-
est of the house; while Pinero with his
sager stagecraft was able to palm off on an
enraptured audience perhaps the longest ser-
mon any playwright has had the courage to
put into a play. This is the exhortation
which Dion Boucicault as Hilary Jesson
delivers to the long-suffering Nina (Irene
Vanbrugh) in the appallingly difficult third
act, an effort in dramatic rhetoric which
showed that the actor was almost as great
a preacher as the Rev. North Ash, of Neutral
Bay. The audience expressed its relief from
the frightful tension of the high moral plane
it had been lifted to by breaking into savage
and exulting cries when Nina announced her
intention of sticking to her original plan of
a primitive revenge; and when later she
substitutes self-sacrifice for vengeance, it is
stage-craft that reconciles the audience to
being cheated of its prey.

Backing the excellent acting of the prin-
cipals was a fine performance by nearly all
the others. C. M. Hallard. as Filmer .les-
son, was a satisfying cuckold, and Eleanor
Ross. Henry Latimer and Ronald Ward vari-
ously depicted the characters of the venom-
ous Ridgeley family. Reginald Wykeham
paid a short but distinguished call as Dr.
Dilnott. and Mrs. Brough, as Lady Ridgeley,
made this Page thankful to the charming
veterans of the stage who save us from the
bad acting that usually goes with elderly
roles.

Long Tack Sam and his cort&ge of
Oriental brethren are again gracing the
honorable boards of Sydney Tivoli. All the
old hands are on view—crockery spinners,
conjurers, baton jugglers, horizontal-bar
specialists and the joker who produces bowls
of water from space to the joy of teetotal-
lers. Sam himself is a prince among show-
men, and the vaudeville world is fortunate
that he entered the entertaining game in-
stead of electing to grow onions. The per-
centage of clog-dancers who would be better
dead is very high, but the lives of Billie and
Beattie Birchell are protected by the per-
fection they have attained in the noisy
business; their latest achievement, an imi-
tation of a starting train, sounds like the
real goods. The Cockneyisms of Duncan
and Godfrey are responsible for an increase
of snoring, and the Statler Sisters should
be let go with a warning.

“The Pickled Porter,” George Wallace’s
latest attempt at Sydney Fuller’s, is sprightly
nonsense, mingled with some tolerable sonsrs

the principals want to cool off. On the
variety side George Wallace, Junior, follows
in puppa’s footsteps and obliges the “gods”

Melbourne comes to Sydney:—
.John Eaton, of Melbourne, interprets the environs
of the southern city in a low-keyed mood of melan-
choly. There are no harsh, dramatic notes in any
of the pictures at present showing at Harringtons’.
Solitary gums, wide plains and spectral fences all
sing the same gentle symphony, which may not
impress those who believe that the camera lens
only tells the truth when it is stopped down and
focussed to maximum definition. There is, however, as
much sincere and sympathetic craftsmanship in this
show of photographs as in many a collection of
etchings.
Allan Wilkie has been adhering to his
programme of nightly changes, w’ith occa-
sional repetitions of the most popular works
of the bard. “Twelfth Night,” “Much Ado”
and “As You Like It" are popular fancies,
apparently; in the last two Miss Hunter-
Watts is w T ell suited, and the company gener-
ally makes a very good showing. “Romeo
and Juliet,” which arrived last Saturday, is
one of the weak links in the company’s
chain ; Miss Hunter-Watts neither represents
the care-free spirit of the IG-year-old Juliet
nor the intensity of later awakened passion;
Claude Saunders, looking an ideal Romeo,
speaks his lines with a precision which sug-
gests no sparks from the anvil of love; and
Allan Wilkie himself fails to catch the buoy-
ancy of Mercutio. though he is satisfying
enough in the frivolous babbler’s death scene.
Gus Neville’s Friar Lawrence and Vincent
Scully’s Apothecary contained the best work.
Monday saw “Cymbeline” revived, with
“Hamlet” and “The Winter’s Tale” follow-
ing; this afternoon (Thursday) “The Mer-
chant of Venice” seeks his pound of public
flesh, with “The Comedy of Errors” at night.
Three nights are to be added to the season.
Then the co. takes a couple of nights’ rest,
pending the production of “She Stoops to
Conquer” on Easter Saturday.
At tlio end of another week the dress-
maker will cease to lead on to the stage
of Melbourne Majesty’s his bevy of tuneful
and nimble-limbed assistants with the frocks
which are to clothe Betty for her new
station in life. “Primrose” is to bloom on
Easter Saturday night.
The New Princess’s has been dusted and
swept for the reception of “Little Jessie
James” on Easter Saturday. The lady is
said to have had a record run in Noo York;
and, although the task of the big Yankee
Warren does not always coincide with that
of Australian playgoers, the Hugh Ward
management talks confidently of making new
records with the show in Melbourne. Any-
way, the Southern city always has a wel-
come ready for Dot Brunton; and the
novelty of a jazz orchestra which is incor-
porated in the play will draw the curious.

Although it is announced that Guy Bates
Post is to reproduce “The Masquerader” be-
fore the termination of his Melbourne sea-
son, there is no other hint so far that “The
Green Goddess” is to finish her sway at the
King’s. The thrillful drama continues to
attract the multitude that likes a solid
meal served with the rich gravy of excite-
ment.

“So This Is London” is amongst the
Easter-tide ‘casualties. Thurston Hall will
cease to be a Yankee boot manufacturer
next Saturday; the Royal will then go into
recess until Pauline Frederick introduces
“Spring Cleaning” on Easter Saturday
night. If the crowds which were moved to
give the lady a reception when she arrived by
train (a hefty policeman had the delightful
job of carrying the lady from the Spencer-
street station to save her from the mobbing
of her admirers) are any criterion, the sea-
son is going to change the luck of a theatre
which has for months past experienced
rather lean times.

For one week more “Cappy Ricks” will
talk about his dollars and his force of
character at the Melbourne Athenaeum. The
little comedy has scored a remarkable suc-
cess, and in its 10th week still fills the little

been made, and the show has to close unless,
of course, the said arrangements can bo
postponed. .T. I). O’Hara was to play
“Skittles” on Easter Saturday, but no man-

Old friends came in crowds to Melbourne
Tivoli to greet “The Two Rascals”; and in
that friendly atmosphere even a bad turn
would have had to go well. But if Eddie
Fields and Charlie O’Donnell had been a
bad turn they could hardly have achieved
that atmosphere. Such rippling nonsense as
“The Little Wooden Whistle Wouldn’t

appeal when supplied by two artists whose
greatest asset is an ability to convey a sense
of supreme enjoyment of life. Clement May

ance ; and Wee Willie Lancet still appears

it, the Agents will send it post
free on receipt of a postal note
for
THERE will be no barber’s shop near your camp.
You should have in your holiday kit a razor
which can be relied upon to shave you comfort-
ably every day without the slightest need of skilled
sharpening or of fresh supplies of blades.
There is only one razor which entirely fulfils these
requirements. The Valet Auto Strop Razor strops
itself automatically by means of the self-stropping
device built right into the razor head. Every Valet
blade gives, at least, forty or fifty perfect shaves.
Call at the nearest store and ask the man behind the
counter to show you how the Valet Auto Strop Razor

ALWAYS SAFE IN A
BIG BLOW
No matter how stiff the wind is the “Billabong" is safe. The
Automatic Governor and Speed Regulator presses the brake
on the windwheel and slows it down to a safe pumping speed.
When a gale blows up the Regulator throws the wheel out of
the wind, and does not bring it back till it is safe to do so.
OIL ONCE EVERY SIX
MONTHS
Tlie new enclosed gear “Billabong” has double
massive gears working in an enclosed gear-box.
Partially fill this gear box with oil every six
months, that is all the attention it wants.
These two points make the “Billabong” a favorite
on big stations and runs where the mills are far
apart. No worry about damage by storms —or time
lost in oiling. We still manufacture the old-type
“Billabong.” Many users found it so satisfactory
that they still order and recommend it. Write

Within 5 Short Years—a Household Word!
Within five short years the P. & C. has
become a household word throughout Aus-
tralia. Each year since inception the Company
has made history in Australia, creating new
records for Life Assurance, making a host of
new friends.
The reasons? Firstly, because the P. & C.
blazed the trail of co-operation as applied to
Life Assurance, and is linked with the most
influential co-operative bodies in each State of
the Commonwealth. Secondly, because its
policies are specially designed to meet the
peculiar requirements of the man on the land.
Thirdly, because fair treatment, prompt settle-
of claims, and a spirit of helpful co-operation
has won for the company goodwill everywhere.

Last week’s concert under the direction ot
the Ormond Professor of Music, at the Mel-
bourne Assembly Hall, introduced a new
string quartet of which one member, Heinzc,
who had the first violin in hand, was a mem-
ber of the Lejeune Quartet, one of the musi-
cal combinations of Paris. Stanley Tompkins,
William Lamble and Louis Hattenback were
the others. The work of the four was uni-
formly good; but there were occasional in-
cursions of applause wliich indicated that
not all the audience understood the music as
well as they wished the rest to believe. A
somewliat dramatic work by Frank Bridge,
full of brilliant movements and charming
digressions, rendered with fine tonal imagery,
was the event of the evening; it was backed
by faithful offerings of Beethoven’s Op. 18
(No. 2) and Schubert’s Op. 29.
The Easter Art Show epidemic:—
On the day Harold Herbert's show opened at the
Fine Art Gallery, Melbourne, the red tab was on
19 of the 30 water-colors. Herbert is building up
a reputation which is filling suburban horned witli
pictures designed to occupy just the right amount of
wall space. Careful craftsmanship justifies the
popularity ; the one fault is a lack of inspiration—
the artist appears to be satisfied to fill those subur-
ban wall spaces. It is a sound commercial ambition,
no doubt, but is a pity, nevertheless; an occasional
venture into really ambitious work on the part of
an artist who has all the qualifications might
reasonably be expected. The water-colors are backed
by a number of etchings—good but not up to the
standard of the color work.
Criticism is invited by a catalogue statement that
Miss A. E. M. Bale “may be set down as the best
of Australian woman painters,” a declaration that
might be less venturesome if “flower” was put
before the last word. Her portraits are stodgy, and
her landscapes in the main uninspiring. “Evening,
Warrandyte” (No. 62) and “The Yarra in Autumn”
(No. 44) are exceptions. But the flower studies are
altogether admirable; one of a bunch of dahlias (No.
10) is even delightful. The show is at the New
Gallery, Melbourne.
R. G. McCann has returned from Europe with a
cartload of paintings, now showing at Melbourne
Athensum Hall, and a sheaf of eulogistic notices,
some of them from French papers which acclaim
him as one who, without being an imitator, is
another Corot. A view of his 108 offerings forces
the suggestion that his Australian showing is mainly
the left-overs from a strenuous European existence.
There are glimpses of the power which might have
inspired the critiques in French papers usually chary
of praise; but the general feeling inspired by the
exhibition is that here are largely the failures of an
artist who has struck success in a certain line of
blatancy. The atmosphere naturally is not Aus-
tralian ; and in such themes as “Fog in Kensington
Gardens” (No. 2) he gets a wonderfully fine
effect with a few trees in a background of fog.
Without doubt the artist has capacity above the
ordinary; he has a fine sense for atmosphere and a
feeling for beauty; but, inspired no doubt by
adulation, he has adopted what is sometimes a
daring misuse of color in order to get effect —and
does not always succeed in doing it.
At the Queen’s Hall there is a harmless show of
water-colors by Miss Elsie Barlow. Some snow
scenes of Sassafras and Buffalo are effective; yet
why the lady should allow the snow to be repre-
sented by the white paper upon which the rest of
the color is splashed is a mystery. It is slovenly,
lifeless work. Elsie Barlow can paint if she likes ;
the fact that she avoids using her brush where a
bit of real paint would finish an effort gives the
idea that in a desperate moment she has pawned
her white. “Red Banks, Swansea” (No. 38), “Mid-
summer, liyneton” (No. 19) and “Sand Dunes at
Night, Swansea,” give an impression that she is a
real artist and not a mere producer of cheap wall-
coverings. Stanley Lucas and Jack Myers exhibit
with the show some nice knick-knacks —bridge-scorers,
albums and other items nicely decorated, which the
well-to-do might be proud to possess. The whole-
affair is a sideshow of art really—but, of course,
that is what most “art shows” are.

Pictures in Adelaide at the moment are
largely devoted to Hollywood, their birth-
place. “Potash and Perlmutter,” at the
York is funny, the sub-titles for once help-
ing mainly to that end. West’s has Percy
Marmont in the dreariest drama that ever
was; but the brisk Douglas Fairbanks is
on the doorstep. Wondergraph is more con-
ventional in the story of a woman, a kid and
a dog, “Half a Dollar Bill.” “Kid Boots” is
finishing its record run at the Royal with
George Gee controlling the remarkable golf
club in which the younger members all fra-
ternise with the club pro., and congratulate
him heartily on his promising love affair
with the millionaire member’s daughter. The
Prince of Wales keeps the serious drama go-
ing, ranging from “The Midnight Wedding”
(Darcy Kelway very strong on the humor-
ous side) to the old Corelli “Sorrows of
Satan.” And the Majestic has the Davey
juggling, clever and funny.

AN END OF IT.
(For The Bulletin.]
The dreams I dreamed when I was a lover
Are all gone over. A shrill bell rings,
The lights are out and the entr’acte over.
The drama is on. Death waits in the wings.
I am the fool of the piece. No story
Was ever complete without its fool;
Someone else gets the gold and the glory,
And 1 get only the dunce’s stool.
Death in the wings. An end of dreaming!
Footlights, people and play are past.
There is an end to all my scheming—
The curtain falls on a fool at last.

“Storky” (U.S.A.) : The thoughts of
Australian managers who visit North America
these days must be long, long thoughts.
Leon Errol, now a full-blown citizen of
Coolidge’s Republic, has been allotted his
first real starring engagement in the Ziegfeld
show, “Louis the XIV.,” at N’York Cosmo-
politan. Leonard Wiley was on Broadway
till recently as the lead in Simon. Called
Peter.” Passing through Philadelphia I saw
that O. P. Heggie was playing the name-
part in “Minick.” He made a hit in this
piece on Broadway, where it ran for several
months. Harry Sweeney, known here as
Harry Mowbray, is supporting Doris Keene
in “Starlight.” Judith Anderson has fol-
lowed up her success in “Cobra” by co-
starring with Holbrook Blinn in the Belasco
production of “The Dove.” These five Aus-
tralians are right in the front rank of the
profession in America. Yet there are Aus-
tralian showmen who have the gall to sug-
gest that Australians can’t act well enough
for the pitchers!
“Charlick”: It has always been recognised
that Edward German (B. 2G/3/’25) wa3
the legitimate successor of Sullivan in that
form of composition which so increased the
latter’s fame and fortune. German’s music
is of very high standard —full of melody,
with colorful orchestration hardly inferior,
if at all, to Sullivan’s, but it lacks that
supreme attribute of humor which made the
Gilbert and Sullivan collaboration so unique.
The deterioration of the public taste or the
absence of a librettist —Basil Hood being
dead —may account for his small output.
In the last chat I had with Captain Hood,
a few months before I came to Australia,
he agreed that for a comic-opera librettist
to have a chance of success he must get
as far away from Gilbert as possible. “Rose
of Persia” was then in his mind. In Aus-
tralia the opera was not a great success,
principally on account of the Oriental leth-
argy which pervaded the music and the
action. Williamson had a brilliant idea, so
the wonderful Milmie Everett invented a
ballet, Leon Caron composed (as always)
“THE GREATER THE TRUTH," ETC.
GWEN ( criticising portrait): “I shouldn’t
make it too like her, Jimmy; she might
be offended!”
excellent music, and the second act was
brightened up considerably. Within a week
a cable arrived from London: “Withdraw
ballet or opera.” J.C.W.’s contract with
the Savoy did not permit of these interpo-
lations. I wonder what the Cartes would
have said had they known about the second
act of “Pinafore” and the finale of “Pirates”!
“Ces”: An enterprising youth with stage
ambition has just completed a walk of 1500
miles to join Allan Wilkie in Melbourne. As
a small boy Alf Clitherow was employed by
Wilkie at Broken Hill to sell programmes
and run messages. He waited a couple of
years and then, hearing that the co. was in
Adelaide, set after them per boot, with the
proceeds of the sale of a bike and a few
other articles of personal property in his
pocket. When he reached Adelaide the mum-
mers had gone, so he took on farm-laboring.
Later, getting news that the co. was in Mel-
bourne, he bought a ss. railway ticket, went
as far as that would take him, and alter-
nately “jumped the rattler” and walked the
rest of the way, only to jniss again. His
next tramp was to Sydney,’ but again he was
too late. However, hearing that the Shaks-
pearean outfit was due back in Melbourne
shortly, he worked his way to Wagga, where
he got a job taking care of a truck of horses
going to Albury and Melbourne. There he
caught up with the co. and got his old job
back again, which brings him a little nearer to
his dream. Alf has the theatre in his blood.
His father was an old actor who had found a
niche at Broken Hill as a theatrical agent.
“Ibsenshaw”: A new farce by the perpe-
trator of that riotous piece of fooling, “A
Little Bit of Fluff”
—a standing dish
in London for two
years, but not
much of a success
in Australia—was
staged in Fogtown
a few weeks ago.
The novelty, oddly
called “The Mon-
key House,” had
what the critics
term “a mixed re-
ception.” Towards
the end of the
piece the author
helped to queer his
own pitch with
various unfortu-
nate remarks made
by his characters.
“This is hopeless,”
said one. “I can’t
stand any more of
it!” exclaimed an-
other sentiments
of which an impati-
ent gallery showed
its hearty approval.
The climax came
when a lady play-
ing the part of an
excitable French
woman burst out
with “This is too
damned jolly aw-
ful !” The line was
greeted with salvoes of derisive cheering, and
the fate of “The Monkey House” w r as sealed.
“Flaming Youth”: A sort-of-a-kind of
actor decided that the game was no good
and applied for a clerical job, mentioning
that J. C. Williamson would give him a re-
ference. James Cassius was inclined to re-
sent the use of his name when the employer
called in person, but satisfied the latter’s
inquiring mind. “Do you think he will make
a good clerk?” demanded the employer. “Pro-
bably,” retorted Jimmy. “He ought to be
good at something; and he’s a damned bad
actor.”
“Peter Pan” : Brisbane had the Australian
premiere of “The Pelican” simultaneously
with the Adelaide staging of “Kid Boots.”
A rapturous reception in one of the smaller
cities is not always a criterion of success in
Sydney and Melbourne. A case in point was
“The Lady of the Rose,” which made such a
hit in the Bananaland capital last August
that the co. was told to prepare for a 20
weeks’ season at Melbourne Majesty’s. Un-
fortunately it didn’t work out that way.
However, “The Pelican” seems a pretty sure
thing. Its authors, Tennyson Jesse and 11.
M. Harwood, are deft craftsmen, and the
thing is well done by Frank Harvey, Harvey
Adams, Mayne Linton and Maurice Tuohy.
Besides, Muriel Starr has. an emotional part,
with the happy ending demanded by the
young ladies of the hats and haberdash
departments.
“Lud”: There should be a place in London
for John Kirby, considering the number of
players who have recently gone to England
from this side of the world and secured
engagements in West-end theatres. Robert
Chisholm, the good-looking baritone of many
Williamson musical plays, is appearing in
“Sometime” at the Vaudeville. Clarice Hard-
wicke, after a spell of pantomime at the
Ilippbdrome (where Madge Elliott has a part
in a new revue), has gone on—and up—to
Drury-lane, where she is in an American
success, “Rose Marie,” shortly to be seen
here. Vera Pearce and Irene Browne are
in the cast of “No, No, Nanette,” at the
Palace, Diana Wilson is in “Lightnin’ ” at
the Shaftesbury, and Dorothy Seacombe is
the youthful heroine of “Just Married,” at
the Comedy. Over the water, at the Old
Vic., Marie Ney has established herself as a
Shakspearean actress. It certainly is a case
of Advance Australia on the English boards.
“Lysander”: Her 1200 performances of
Shakspeare have told on the never-strong
voice of Frediswyde Hunter-Watts. In the
Wilkies’ present season the strained con-
tralto-profundo of Constance, Lady Anne and
Lady Macbeth often intrudes where the light-
some tones of Mistress Ford and Rosalind
should hold the play. The graceful Fredis-
wyde will need to work herself less hard if
her ambition of playing the full range of
Shakspeare’s plays is to be realised. Jean
Atholl is willing and hard-working, but with
the retirement from the Wilkie cast of Lorna
Forbes and Irene Webb the load laid on the
leading woman has become grievous.
“F.T.K.”: If John Cosgrove (B. 26/3/’25)
proves as humorous in print as he is in
congenial company, his reminiscences will
sell briskly. John has a great stock of
anecdotes and witty sayings. He it was who
described a pawned suit as “flirting with the
mothballs of Israel,” and who told an im-
portunate youth who had backed a pi’oduc-
tion of “Sappho” to “see me after the show—
I’m to get a million francs in the second
act.” And there was a travelling show-
man who had produced a play of which John
claimed the authorship. Away went a tele-
gram : “What about my royalties?” Promptly
came the reply: “The age of miracles is
GOSPEL TRUTH.
“Jinks did well out of that job-lot of Bibles he bought at a penny
each."

past.” When Pugliese was running the Syd-
ney Alhambra Cosgrove was engaged to give
something in the monologue line. Delivered
with gusto it took the house by storm, and
the cheering didn’t stop until John wefit on
again and recited —“Casabianca.”
“L.H.P.”: I remember the panorama of
the American Civil War (B. 26/3/’25).
Also “Zulu” Thompson’s pictorial hasli-up
of the Zulu War, which toured Australia in
the early ’eighties. Later on Thompsdn
commissioned George Gordon, of Melbourne,
to paint him a diorama on the Egyptian
War, and Gordon, a thorough artist, turned
out a beautiful bit of work. Another “pan.”
I recollect was “The Arctic Regions,” about
ISSO, which was made more attractive by a
lottery. You got with your ticket another,
either numbered or blank. If you struck a
prize you might have to lug home a horse
or a suite of furniture. I used to go night
after night, but the only prize I ever landed
was a thrippenny vase which fell to pieces
as I was leaving the theatre.
“First Old Man”: John D. O’Hara will
take to the greasepaint again, after a three-
months’ holiday, on Easter Saturday. He
is to appear in “Skittles,” a new comedy of
English make, at the cosy Melbourne
Athenaeum Theatre, which should be an ideal
house for John D.’s quiet method. “Skittles”
is from the pen of Lechmere Worrqll, who
was part-author of that effective war comedy,
“The Man Who Stayed at Home.” Maggie
Jarvis, hitherto associated with song-and-
dance pieces, will play the title part.
“Ancient Prompter”: George Randolph
Chester, the man who wrote “Get Rich Quick
AVallingford ” died in debt. According to a
quaint statement of his affairs, he left estate
valued at 5585 dollars (£1160) and debts
totalling 23 399 dollars. And yet the Wal-
lingford books were “best sellers.” George
Cohan, who adapted the story for sta&e pur-
poses. made a pile out of the venture; inci-
dentally the boom helped to push Cohan’s
then brother-in-law, Fred Niblo, into star-
dom. Niblo doesn’t act these days. He pre-
fers to get rich quick at film-producing.
“Minim”: Plays founded on the lives of
the great musicians seem to have become a
vogue. Not so long ago Beethoven provided
a striking star-part for the late Beerbohm
Tree, himself of German descent. Recently
we had a piece written round Franz Schu-
bert. And London is about to see “The
Lady of the Nocturne,” a light opera, with
Chopin as the central figure. Now' what
about Wagner? Surely there is dramatic
stuff in His romantic career!

For countless centuries the Sahara, that trackless waste
of shifting sands, has baffled human resourcefulness.
Two months by camel train were the only means of
passage, two months fraught with hazards, a veritable
contest with death, and death holding loaded dice. 1925
opens a new era in transportation. M. Andre Citroen
announces the establishment of a regular trans-Saharan
automobile service to Timbuctoo by way of Sahara, in
which the vast sand ocean is crossed safely and comfort-
ably in 5 days. Luxurious hotels have been built along
the route, to provide every comfort Citroen cars have
made this remarkable enterprize possible. Citroen effici-
ency is the entire guarantee of safety. Only a car
dependable in every sense could undertake this feat.
It will redound to Citroens credit through motoring

liability is undertaken re contributions volun-
tarily submitted; and no MS. will be returned
unless stamps accompany.
T.G.: Off our beat. . . .Geordie: It doesn't
make a ripple.... Enque: The statement of the late
Archie Meston that the Talgai skull was that of “a
blackfellow shot by the police and buried in a
billabong” has been scouted by Professor David....
B. ; No place for it here, unless it has some
direct connection with Australia... .J.W. (Brisbane):
Try subjects that haven’t been done to death....
C. : No space for pictures of five-legged beasts.
....Faceplate: May use R.P.A.: But under the
English law she doesn’t. If a man in England dies
intestate leaving, besides a widow and a mother,
various nephews and nieces, the latter get one-
fourth of the estate, provided there are no nearer
relations to wheel up their barrows... .Rosey:
Much obliged to you ; but it would look rather like
helping ourselves to the butter.... Sukampin: Thanks ;
but space won’t allow of it... .L.T.W.: Lot too
windy.... Downatheels: Sorry, no good. Why won’t
you people write of the little things you’ve got almost
exclusive information about ?... ,E.M.C.: Thanks, but
no use.... Ray H.: You'll have to get a better
idea of both rhyme and rhythm... .Charles 51.:
Not up G.E.R.; No, they don’t scan. What is
far worse, they don't try to say anything worth
while.... Julian E.: It has feeling, but the yarn
is not well told. .. .R.J.8.: Interest too slight....
Charles L.: Occult influences moving about billiard
balls don't stir any emotion in this office.... Con-
stance F.: Descriptive articles of ordinary globe-
trotting are not in our line... .Sydney G.: The orchid
yarn is too improbable. .. .A.R.N.: Fails rather badly.
. ...C.8.8.: The black Bolshevik drags along very
wearily.... Lois F.: The verse has a chance; the
yarn is hopeless.... Brenda B.; Try again in six
years.... Bellerive: Your poem goes right to the
heart:—
In billions they breedeth
Among swamps and trees;
They gather in clusters
And soar at their ease;
In the sultry darkness
With a buzzing sound
They inflicteth fierce bites
As they saileth around;
Infesting the houses
In their wanton flight,
They blister our hide—
The pests of the night.
Buzzing and prancing
In clouds they arise—
Curse the mosquitoes!
Tney’re worse than the flies.
. ...M.C.A.: Sorry, but you can’t turn cheap com-
monplaces without rhyme or metre into verse by
merely chopping the block into lines... .E.D.S.: It
falls far short... .F.T.L.: The verse has too many
warts. . . .Will T. (Wanganui) : Terrible. .. .Edna W.:
Sad rubbish.... Mabel A.: Not much demand for
those goods in this market.... Harry P.: The
attempt to rhyme “Circe” with “worse” is about
the most heroic we have met.... A.D.F.: Has some
points. See if you can’t supply a few more....
A.S. (Manly): No interest.... J.M.S.: Thin little
thing that staggers a bit before it collapses....
Harold M.: Doesn’t strike us hard enough... .T.L.J.:
That sort of stuff is neither verse nor prose....
N.B. (Stanwell P.) : The ideas don’t amount to much
and the verse is far too lumpy. .. .Telopea Boy: Not
far from hopeless. Why use words you can’t pro-
nounce ?.... N.H. (Gundagai): All of them are on
the track, but none quite arrive at the pub....
Wilstrive: Wooden and unattractive matter in knotty
verse... .F.F.; Wallows and bumps... .H.A.D.: The
statement that “The Face Upon the Floor” is an
Australian favorite would need some proof. It is
really poor doggerel... .K.N.: No g00d... .liitchie:
The verse wants sandpapering... .Ethel D.: “Cir-
cumstance” is too slight.... Coreen N.: It has some
force; put in a bit more work on it... .E.L.W.:
Doesn’t get anywhere near.... Paul R.: Poor stuff.
That scheme of putting in an occasional rhyme when
you find it particularly easy is not likely to take
you far.... Rita C.: Not bad, but not good enough.
....Womma: Verses so lumpy that we got sea-sick
before we reached the end... .Ripponlea: Only wants
a bucket or two of blood to give it real tone: —
Th’ woman gazed morbidly o’er th’ Bridge,
She was about that age that women call forty.
As she stared at th’ river over the edge
Did her eyes become watery.
A hot Melbourne summer day was it,
And th’ woman was weary but full of grit.
There was that in her eyes which was very desolate,
But her jaw was grim and very resolute.
She gave a low moan and her skin bleached.
“Curse you, you mongrel, Sir Edward Carstairs,”
she screeched.
She sailed through the air with a whistling, echoing
whine,
And lobbed with a smack that threw up th’ brine.
Some men came up in a dirty, gloomy barge,
And took her to th’ 'Morgue so roomy and large.
They dried her poor face so swollen with pain,
Then turned her over and let her drain.
.... J.H. (North Sydney) : Poor verse telling a dreary
tale C.M.T.: The parable or allegory or what-
ever the thing is leaves us c01d... .R.F.F.: Some
nice lines, but not enough to carry it. Get to
work on it. .. .W.M.8.L.: “Lost Love” and “Unknow-
ing” are thin and tired.... Grey Z.: Disjointed sort
of ramble K.F.M.: Goes as heavily as Evangeline
the blood-sweating ’potamus... . O.W. (Ipswich): As
empty almost as it could be... .Wallace G.: In no
way remarkable for its matter, and it is not a
poem.... A.F.F.: Falls badly over its own feet.-..
Pursk: There’s a good idea wrapped in your
“Blanket”; but it wants more elbow-grease....
T.T.R.: Same to “Olden Days” Faceplate: It
ought to grip us; but it doesn’t... .A.A.A.: We’d
tear up “Small Things” if we were you. That
cigar idea has been worked to the bone... .Crad-
dock; Mostly adjectives; and the young writer
could do much worse than swear not to use more
than one adjective to the page Mountain D.:
Another stepped in first —several others, in fact.
....Nit: Hope you’ll live long enough to be sorry
you parodied that poem.
TO ARTISTIC (AND INARTISTIC)
CORRESPONDENTS.
8.W.: You’re a well-meaning patriot, but a di--
astrous cartoonist.... S.C.A.W.: Clacks feebly, like
an overtaken hen. ... 0.L.: The drawing is a remini-
scence and the gag a has-been.... E.W.: They look
like the artistic compositions of a capsized ink-
pot. ... R.S.J.: Pencil smudge of a colored familv,
two palm-trees, a moon and an animal (unidenti-
fied) of no particular interest.

LABOUR-SAVING IS NECESSARY
IN THE HOME, TOO.
IN your shearing-shed you have modern sh earing-machines—for cultivating
your land you have tractors, disc ploughs, cultivators, reapers and binders,
and other labor-saving machinery—but what of your home?
If it is necessary to provide time and labor-saving appliances for your farm
or station, it is equally necessary to relieve the tedious work of your family.
Domestic labor-saving devices are no longer an experiment—they are reliable and
inexpensive. Fans, vacu,um-cleaners, washing-machines, pumps, irons and toasters
may all be operated with DELCO-LIGHT, and in addition your house, sheds and
outbuildings can be flooded with brilliant electric light.

anikoro”: The islands off the Queens-
land coast are not the only ones that are
going into the wool business (B. 12/3/’25).
At the recent Sydney wool sales the cata-
logue included a clip from the New Hebrides.
And Easter Island, where the giant statues
are, is now used for sheep, though, accord-
ing to Macmillan Brown, who has been work-
ing on the history of the place lately, it
is a pretty poor run.

“G.P.L.F.”: These foreign lotteries
deserve more Government attention than
they get; seldom is anything more heard of
the money sent to buy tickets once it leaves
our shores. The latest is the Danish Colonial
Money Lottery; and a Copenhagen firm is
flooding Australia with circulars in which it
is stated that £ 1G5,0U0 in cash must be won,
that the highest possible prize is £35,000, and
that “nearly every second ticket must win.”
The last statement ought to give the thing
away; but it is hard to protect people who
are hungry for easy money.
* * * *
“A. 5.0.”: Vic.’s Education Department
pays up, and subsequently recovers from the
delinquent, when the under-paid teacher
fails to meet the premium due on his com-
pulsory life-assurance policy. Recently the
Department paid 14 such premiums in a
batch, but in remitting overlooked the charge
for interest on account of late payment.
Thirteen premiums were due for a further
Gd., the other for a shilling. A polite re-
minder to this effect by the Life office con
corned brought an immediate response in
the shape of 14 separate cheques. Strange
to say they all arrived in the one envelope.
“Pat Busliie”: Not long ago the N.S.W.
Government decided that, whenever a
garnishee order was issued in the Small
Debts Court attaching any debt or wages,
the judgment debtor should be notified by
post of the happening, presumably to pre-
pare him for the shock of getting only £4 for
his fortnight’s work when maybe he ex-
pected £l4. The idea was a good one, per-
haps ; but as garnishees are usually issued
on pay day, or the day before, and as the
notice is sent the debtor by post, the first he
knows about it is when the pay envelope is
light. The subsequent notice seems rather
like putting in the boot. Nobody wants an
official intimation that his wages have been
tampered with after he has discovered the
fact for himself.

“Borom”: A good deal of opium comes
into the Commonwealth by being thrown
overboard from incoming mailboats for a
waiting motor-launch to pick up (B.
5/8/’25), but most of it enters at points
along the lonely Northern littoral, and is
brought south b,y an organised delivery. This
system has its headquarters in Townsville,
with ramifications from Darwin down to
Melbourne, and is said to be so reliable that
a consignment landed north of Cairns, or
in the Gulf, will be delivered almost as
quickly as if it were sent by post. At
present there is no shortage of the drug in
Australia, nor has there been for some years
past; only a little while ago the cheaper
grades were being sold in Sydney for as
little as £3 a tin, and the better stuff was not
bringing much more. It is said (probably
with a good deal of truth) that somewhere
in Australia there is a large reserve, stored
up by the ring against eventualities, and
that the value of this reserve runs into a
fortune, even at current prices. Occasionally,
when the price drops too much, those behind
the business arrange for a temporary short-
age in order to improve the price, and gener-
ally this has the desired effect.
* * * *
“Clifford Snook”: A frequent and un-
satisfactory type of case which takes up
the time of the courts concerns the alleged
ownership of a prize in Tatt.’s or that
other well-known gamble, the Golden Bris-
ket. The ticket was in the name of Smith-
son, and it drew Stickphast, which won in
a canter. Thereupon Brownson applies to
the law for an injunction on the ground
that he is half owner of the ticket and the
prize, but has no documentary evidence to
prove it, and, as a rule, no other kind of
evidence. The legitimate rage of Brownson,
if lie really paid half the price of the ticket
and is being done out of his share of the
winnings, is understandable. So is the legi-
timate frenzy of Smithson if he bought the
ticket on his own, and doesn’t even know
Brownson, or if he knows of Brownson in
a distant way as a virulent Orangeman
while he (Smithson) is a good R.C. and a
subscriber to the Sinn IFein funds. It
would save a lot of trouble if it was enacted
that the whole prize belongs to Smithson un-
less properly written, stamped and attested
evidence is shown to the contrary, and if the
result teaches* Bffownson ordinary business
habits he will at least gain something. Pos-
sibly he will get wild and assassinate
Smithson, but somebody is always being
assassinated more or less.
* * * *
“Anaf” : For some time past the Federal
authorities have been aware of an organ-
isation for smuggling in Chinese coolies, but
it was only a few weeks ago that the traffic
was brought forcibly to notice by the produc-
tion in a Sydney court, during the hearing
of a Chinese assault case, of a printed notice
which, on behalf of a society, offered £lOO
reward to the person who murdered an in-
former against the organisation’s activities.
Generally the traffic is in seamen and others
who desert from their ships in port, there
being so many of these now that it is no
longer necessary to bring the would-be immi-
grants as stowaways. It is comparatively
easy to get the Chinese ashore; the greatest
difficulty is to keep them under cover until
it is safe for them to emerge. This is done
by sending them to Chinese employers in the
country or outer suburbs, where they toil
for the barest pittance, sometimes for no-
thing at all. until they have worked off their
cost to their employers, who have to pur-
chase them from the controlling organisa-
tion. The reason for the notice encouraging
the murder of informers is that the Govern-
ment has been trying to check the traffic
by more or less handsomely rewarding all
who bring any information regarding the
whereabouts of 'Chinese unlawfully in the
country, and so many have succumbed re-
cently to the temptation that the heads have
got scared.

getting the very best of materials for his
Plumbing work.
Miles of Piping of varied sorts passes
through his hands for the different classes

Another grizzled veteran of the Indian
Mutiny has just answered the last roll-call
in Maoriland. Thomas Andrews marched
with the brigade from Bombay to the relief
of Delhi; subsequently he took part in several
historic engagements. He died at Avondale,
aged 89.
Who says Scots are mean? On top of his
pension, Alexander Marshall, who recently re-
tired from the pulpit of the Collins-street
kirk, was handed a cheque for £3OO0 —just
to go on with. Nobody was asked to gi’e
onything, but a couple of hundred just
dropped a handfu’ o’ siller each on the table
and made up the wee heap.
At a recent competition among Maori boys
for a scholarship at Te Aute College the
winner turned up in Wikiriwhi, a boy at the
college. Yet Tawhiri, a boy who was edu-
cated at a village school, would have annexed
the honor but for the loss of 200 marks by
his total ignorance of Maori. This gives
point to the recent decision of the Native
Teachers’ Association to approach the Uni.
Senate and urge it to make the Maori lan-
guage a compulsory subject for all Maoris
sitting for matriculation.
Crimean veterans still crop up. J. F.
Pearce, of Gladstone (S.A.), was born at
Falmouth, Cornwall, in 1839. At the battle
of Alma (1854) he was on the Sanspareil,
a covering ship, and he took part in the siege
of Sebastopol. After some gun-running ex-
periences during the American Civil War, ho
came to S. Aus., for a while was a messenger
at the Adelaide Hospital, and ended his
working days as a warder at the Gladstone
Gaol.
“Myoldern”: I wonder if there are many
places in Australia where families are larger
or children healthier than at maligned Dar-
win. I have just been making a census of
the families within a quarter-mile radius of
my humpy. Not all the children are Terri-
tory-born, of course, but all have spent most
of their lives here, and many are settling
down to rear Territory families of their own.
Here is the list: A, 7 children ; B, 6; C, 3;
I), 11; E, 5; F, 1; G, 6; H, 8; I, 11 ; J, 1;
Iv, 3 ; L, 7 ; M, 10; N, 5 ; O, 2 ; P, 8 ; Q, 5 ;
11, 9; S, 5. Average, a shade under half a
dozen. And, except for two fatal accidents,
there lias been no death in those families for
the last six years.
“Mick Anic”: There is an almost chronic
shortage of rolling-stock in N.S.W., especi-
ally of “S” and “D” trucks. Even in ordinary
periods the railways are hard put to it to
keen up with requirements. In abnormal
periods, such as the present, when wool and
wheat have to be removed, something very
like chaos is bound to ensue. Considerable
time would be saved if shipping facilities
were, provided at Newcastle for at least a
portion of North and North-West freights
instead of almost everything being idiotically
dragged to Sydney. Unless that is done at
once a huge truck-building programme will
have to be adopted, especially in regard to
“S’’ and “D” trucks.
“Simon”: Arrack is by no means the
devastating liquor “Bret Vane” (B.
12/3/’25) would have us believe. Properly
made, it is a distillation from grape-juice,
and has about the same (40 p.c.) compelling
power as ordinary whisky. Before the war
the Syrian community in Sydney imported
the stuff from Turkey. It has a flavor like
aniseed, and, when the necessary water is
added, takes on an additional seeming inno-
cence by turning milky. I once got a few
bottles for a church turnout, and ladies who
wouldn’t be seen even sipping weak wine
tripped along three or four times for “ani-
seed.” I never knew the wowsers of the
flock to be so agreeable.
“D.F.”: I do not know whether it still
exists, but there used to be a box of snuff
on the mantelpiece of John Murdoch and
Sons, long-established flourmillers of Hobart,
for the delectation of clients who liked it.
In any case are there any snufftakers left
now? The habit seems to have died out
entirely. The invention of matches must
have had much to do with killing it. In
the old days of flint and steel and tinderbox
smoking was not the easy thing it is now,
but a pinch of snuff could be taken anywhere
and at any time. Chewing tobacco, except
in America, is a habit now mostly indulged
in by sailors, bushworkers and others at
times when they have no chance to light a
pipe.
“Topee”: Is our educational system a
failure? Thirty years ago a Sydney labor-
ing man, father of three boys, suggested to
the elder two that they should get to work
early and help him to give their young
brother, who was reckoned the clever one of
the family, but somewhat delicate, a good
education for a start in life. It was done
willingly, and the young ’un was kept at his
studies till nearly 19, when his brothers
married. During the Christmas holidays I
met all three. The eldest, who had gained
a commission in the Boer War, returned from
the late struggle a full colonel and now
holds a good staff appointment in a neigh-
boring State. The second boy paid £9OOO
last year for the lease of a city hotel. The
scholar? He is regarded by his employers,
an eminent firm of funeral furnishers, as the
most trustworthy hearse-driver they have
had for years!
“Titus Salt” : The law hereabouts is free
from the taint of undue ferocity. A recent
case concerned two women, Jean and Mary,
who conducted an apparently amateurish
estate-agency at Paddington, Sydney. They
sold a house for a careless member of their
own sex, Florence by name, and had £628
of her money to account for. Quite oblivious
of the statutes dealing with trust funds, they
used part of this to back four horses at £lOO
each and lost every time. Then they lent
£lO5 to “a man who had asked for a loan,”
and waited events. The Court ordered
each to repay Florence 20s. per week for
150 weeks, so the loser has a sort of pros-
pect that she may recover nearly half her
money without interest in nearly three years.
At his Honor’s suggestion the pair of mis-
directed punters promised to “enter into an
obligation” to pay the other half some day,
and supplied a £5O bond that they would
come up for sentence in two years (by which
time Florence should have recovered £204)
if they failed in their duty. Whether they
retired to resume house-agency is not known.
They weren’t struck off the roil, because there
is no roll of house-agents in N.S.W. And
they weren’t even bound over to keep away
from racecourses.

The Poetical Works of Jones.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
THE modesty of Jones was such
He sought no praise of men,
Yet, fired with dreams, he loved to
clutch
His eager singing pen.
No line of his was seen in print;
And yet his hair grew white
Above the swift and inky sprint
That kept him up all night.
Hi' trusted well the future days,
And saw the ripening time
When men with harrow-loads of hays
Would crown his golden rhyme.
He sold potatoes, corn and cream,
And never bought a drink. •
But ordered paper by the ream
And gallon-jars of ink.
Before he learned to milk a cow
He wore a lyric look ;
Before his hands could hold a plough
His verses filled a book.
And year on year, without a pause.
Through seasons brown or green.
With glowing eyes and hard-set jaws,
lie burned the kerosene.
No wife or kindred Jones possessed.
r His lif< was pure and plain,
Yet lived with such tremendous zest
That, none could call it vain ;
For at the age of forty-five
He sat at rise of sun
A perfect finish to contrive
To epic forty-one.
Each epic was in sixty books.
And every book was long.
Hi gazed with proud and happy looks
On that white mount of song
That starting from the hardwood floor
Rose almost ceiling-high ;
Hut: grander thoughts he kept in store
That yet might touch the sky.
All day he toiled upon his farm.
And longed for fall of night.
When all the Muses shed their charm
And he had time to write.
So much to do, so little done!
All idleness he banned :
And wrote as fast as words could run,
A pen in either hand.
Yes, two great epics sprang like fire
Together from his brain :
Two themes distinct as cork and wire
Rolled out. their double strain ;
And _ when in lines that counted ten
Ill’s double climax rose.
He grasped a new and longer pen
And fixed it to his nose.
In treble flights of soaring song
He filled the paper fast.
And mourned a little for the long
And sadly wasted past.
Hot. eager-hearted as of old.
His spirit blithely l'ose ;
For why despair if he could hold
A pen between his toes?
He found it rather hard to do.
But will can find a way.
lIH practised fleet more supple grew.
New muscles came in play;
And though he kept his works of note
Still running as before.
The little lyrics that he wrote
Were scrawlad upon the floor.
The starry-poirrting pyramid
Of manuscript tvas seen
Through vines and trees that almost hid
Its snowy sides in green.
A great tarpaulin crowned the top
To save it from the rain ;
But Jones went on without a stop
Penning his fourfold strain.
At eighty-odd the poet died ;
And then the great world knew'
\\ hat Jones through all the years had tried
So very hard to do.
His modest energy and zeal
Amazed all lesser men ;
It made their very senses reel
To think of such a pen.
It made their brains begin to swim
To hear of so much ink;
And some beheld their laurels dim
So much they took to drink.
And then the clamorous public rose
For those vast songs athirst:
And people left the picture-shows
Eager to read them first.
Ihe heat engendered by the fame
Of Jones so fired the push
in burry Hills it rose to flame
And spread into the bush.
' vlr >d of wonder came behind
_ And blew the sparks afar,
i iU all the land with smoke was blind
Irom Ryde to Talbragar.
I 'rp, fi re was on the mountain range
rp.l™ Are was on the plain;
J-iie angry weather would not change
Nor yield a drop of rain.
- mi one came riding through the night
cried in aw’ful tones:
iae thousand epics are alight!
-iHe flames are burning Jones!”
Hotly the perspiration dript
Tn r° m h l ero souls that fought
o save the precious manuscript
Tn •° re - t^e last sheet caught.
1 Thi n fi ln , vam ’ all, all in vain !
And \ w urned and blue;
■ The nnhim nes wr ? te in midni ght Pain
rue public never knew.
Conjecture worked itself to death.
An Orphean legend rose
A ° n n d e breathed a magic breath
Ann sang as water flows •
4nd Pl f£ did i Hars took the chance
TnU i lying lon » aud hard,
Tn S. they saw a d raught-horse dance
n rapture round the bard.
There is a moral to this tale
ivi m ?ral none may miss
Amfi^J 11 - lit: i tlc , s t ars grow pale,
And it is simply this:
The men whose inspiration hot
May catch Australia’s tones,
Though keen for print, are really not
Much better off than Jones.
Australians read the printed books
Of all except themselves;
Small English writers have their nooks
Upon the crowded shelves.
But buried under printed miles
Of matter past and dead
Our singing thought is lost in files
Of papers that we read.

A Diversion at Manly.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
MU DANIEL SOUTH WELD, master's
mate in 11.M.5. Sirius, received
orders early one week in the begin-
ning of August, 17SS, to proceed in the
cutter of that vessel to Manly Beach for the
purpose of transporting part of the expedi-
tion with which his Excellency Captain
Arthur Phillip designed to explore the coun-
try lying between the north arm of Port
Jackson and Broken Bay. The rest of the
party were to accompany the Governor in
his own boat.
Amongst the records of the beginnings of
British Australasia not the least valuable
are those of Mr. Southwell, which are pre-
served in manuscript in the British Museum.
They consist of a very graphic personal
journal, or log, and a series of letters ad-
dressed to his mother, Mrs. Jane Southwell,
and to his uncle, the Rev. Wooden Butler,
of Chelsea, and are full of information con-
cerning the new country in which he found
himself, its aboriginal inhabitants and many
of the happenings of the first three years of
its settlement.
Their author, who rose from the lower
deck to the rank of lieutenant between 1780
and 1704, was a competent and highl.v-intelli-
gent seaman, in whom Captain Phillip re-
posed a good deal of confidence. He sailed
from England with the First Fleet in 1787
as a midshipman in the Sirius, having pre-
viously passed the examination necessary to
qualify for a lieutenancy. When the Fleet
left the ('ape of Good Hope on the final stage
of the long voyage to Botany Bay, he was
promoted to fill a vacancy caused by one of
the mates of his ship having been left behind
at Rio de .Taniero, and remained in this posi-
tion on board her "until the beginning of
1700, when he was placed in charge of the
signal station at South Head —thus missing
the wreck of tlfe vessel at Norfolk Island in
March of that year. Attached to the original
MSS. is a note in an unknown hand, which
supplies some brief particulars of his early
service, and reads as follows:
Daniel Southwell belong’d to the Ocean six months,
from May to Nov’r 13, from which time till the 20th
of March, 1782, he belonged to ye Monkey, cutter,
under the command of Lieut’t Glasford, formerly Ist.
Lieut’t of ye Ocean; then from ye 20th Nov. till
2nd of October, 1782, he belong’d to the Perseus
(A. 8.) ; from thence to the Orpheus (A. 11.) till 10th
.Tan’y, ’B3; then to ye Aurora (Mid.) till 12th May,
when p’d off and put out of commission ; was with
Oapt’n Dacres in ye last-mention’d ships; in the
Aurora was rated midshipman during the time I
belonged to her.
A ruddy, cheerful fellow, good-looking and,
good-humored, with an observing eye that
missed little that it gazed upon.
It was some time after 7 o’clock in the
morning when the two boats pushed out of
Sydney Cove, and hoisted sail in the stream
to run down to Manly, the Governor’s gig in
the lead. A light, cold westerly wind was
blowing, and the day was fine and clear.
Once round the point that eame to be known
as Benilong’s—after the native whom Phillip
endeavored, with only partial success, to
civilise —the harbor was altogether in the
state of nature that had characterised it
for unnumbered centuries. Between the
densely wooded hills and promontories to
north and south no single sail but those of
the two little craft was visible. Occasionally,
at the mouth of some quiet cove, a native
might be seen fishing in a frail and crazy
bark canoe, and sometimes, from amongst
the trees on a point, or above a narrow
strip of white beach, a column of blue smoke
twisted thinly up against the dusky green
of the thick foliage to mingle with the blue-
ness of the sky, marking the site of some
primitive camp of the vagrant race, the
beginning of whose end as owners of the
soil was already in sight.
About 9 o’clock the boats grounded in the
middle of the harbor beach at Manly, about
where the wharf is now, and the Governor
and his little party of explorers disembarked.
Mr. Southwell went ashore to receive his
orders.
“I want you to be here about 4 o’clock
on Sunday next, Mr. Southwell,” said Phillip.
“We should easily be back by then.”
“Aye, aye. sir,” replied the mate. “By
4 o’clock. Good luck, sir.”
“So soon as we reached the shore,” he
records in his journal, “the natives assem-
bled round us to the number of seventy or
eighty, and we have reason to think there
were more, with many women and children,
at no great distance. They affected a deal
of good humor and unconcern ; but ’tis be-
lieved they do not much like our coming
amongst them. The watchful eye they keep
upon our people’s musquets is very likely the
effect of fear; but it afso seems expressive
of disappointment, and leads to a doubt of
their sincerity if not thus overawed.”
* * * *
When the two boats had returned to
Sydney, the Governor’s coxswain reported to
Mr. Southwell that one of his crew was miss-
ing—had evidently been left behind at Manly.
“Lord! Who is it. Paton?”
“ ’Tis a young fellie named Love, sir—
Billy Love, a pris’ner. An’ I think he’s
gone away wi’ th’ Injuns, a-purposelike. He’s
been in tow wi’ one o’ th’ women here in
th’ camp for some time —you know, that red-
headed piece, Molly Martin. An’ she’s
tmmed him over for a marine in Cap’n Mere-
dith’s company. Takes it very sore, young
Billy does. Miser’ble. Mopes about all day
an’ half th’ night. I’ve heard him say
meself as liow t he’d a half a mind for to get
away from th’ settlement an’ go an’ live
wi’ th’ blackfellers. I’m a-thinkin’, Mr.
South’ell, that’s wot th’ young fool’s did.
It looks like it, anyway.”
“So it does. Paton. W T ell, I'll have to
report it to the Provost Marshal —I suppose

A TREACHEROUS TROUBLE
Kidney diseases are very dangerous. They come on
silently, gain ground rapidly, and cause thousands of
deaths that could have been prevented by proper
treatment in the beginning. Nature gives early
warnings of kidney disease —backache, twinges of
pain when stooping or lifting, headaches or urinary
disorders. If these symptoms are unheeded there is
grave danger of fatal kidney disease. Doan’s
Backache Kidney Pills have earned a reputation for
their effectiveness in kidney trouble and are known
and recommended the world over.

EXPERIENCES OF SYDNEY PEOPLE.
Mr. Lewis Williams, 602 Botany Road, Botany, Sydney, says :—“I was
a great sufferer with my back and the pain was at times so bad that I had
to leave my work and go home. I was bent almost double and could not
stand up straight without increased suffering. I used various preparations,
but only got slight relief. Reading of cures effected by Doan’s Backache
Kidney Pills, I decided to try them. One bottle eased the pain and the
second completed my cure. This did not happen yesterday, but about two
years ago, and I have had no sign of backache all that time, so it is not
mere temporary relief, but a perfect cure. I am always advising my friends
to use Doan’s Backache Kidney Pills, and am glad to have an opportunity
to publicly recommend them.”
Twelve years later Mrs. Williams says :—“My husband is still well
and mas been free of backache since Doan's Backache Kidney Pills cured him
14 years ago.”
Mrs. W. Sullivan, 61 Kellick Street, Waterloo, Sydney, says:—“l
suffered terribly with my kidneys for some time. I had terrible pains in
my back and could hardly move without suffering torture. I was also subject
to bad headaches, dizzy feelings, and had urinary trouble, the secretions being
thick and cloudy and difficult to pass. Nothing I took seemed to suit my
case, and I suffered on in spite of treatment: but at last I got a good remedy,
and that was Doan's Backache Kidney Pills. A friend advised me to take
a course of these Pills, which I did, and I am pleased to say they cured
me of every distressing symptom mentioned. I used 10 bottles in all, and
my cure is perfect, for I have been as right as rain for the last 12 months.”
Ten years later Mrs. Sullivan says:—“Doan’s Backache Kidney Pills
cured me of backache and kidney trouble 11 years ago, and I am still well.
1 always keep this remedy by me and take a dose or so now and then, just
as a help to the kidneys.”

’tis liis affair. He’s a prisoner, and not one
of our fellows, or I’d take on myself to
go back and look for him. Well, I suppose
he’s either been knocked on the head by
this time or’s got another woman —without
red hair. But why didn't you hail me before
we left Manly Cove?”
“Well, sir, I never noticed he was a-
missiii’ till we got around Mr. Bradley’s
Head. lie wasn’t pullin' on one o’ the oars,
being spare man for th’ day, an’ liis usual
place is in the bows, where, if he sits down
in th’ bottom o’ th’ boat, he ain’t too notice-
able. I didn’t sec he was gone till I sings
out to him to come aft an’ take the tiller
while I cuts meself a pipe o’ ’baccy. That’s
the first I knew of it, Mr. Soutli’ell, sir.”
“Oh, all right then. Baton—l’ll see what’s
to be done about it. I’ll tell Mr. Brewer. I
suppose they’ll send a party after him, and
give him a Botany Bay dozen* or two when
they catch him. The d —d young ninny—
he’ll deserve it! All right. Don’t forget
Sunday. We’ll got away about 2 o'clock,
so be in readiness.”
But the Provost Marshal took the news
of Mr. William Love’s absence with com-
plete philosophy. Upon Mr. Southwell’s in-
quiring whether lie intended to send an ex-
pedition in search pf the missing convict he
smiled and shook his head.
“Not even a drummer, Dan, old hoy. Lot
him go if he wants to be such a fool. ’Tis
all the better for those he hath left behind
him. One more mouth oil' the stores. By
gad, Southwell, from what I understand of
Mr. Miller, the Commissary, ’twould be for
the benefit of all of us who are here did all
the prisoners run away into the woods.”
For half an hour or more Mr. Southwell
remained chatting with Mr. Brewer, who
had been a midshipman in the Sirius, and
then left his quarters with the intention of
rejoining the cutter, waiting for him near
the mouth of the little creek that ran into
the Cove. That brief space of time had
been amply sufficient for the news of the
convict Love’s disappearance to spread
through the little encampment—half-canvas
and half primitive hut—that was Sydney in
August, 1788.
Mr. Southwell had almost reached the
boat, whose crew were hungrily awaiting his
arrival in anticipation of an overdue mid-
day meal aboard the ship, when he heard
steps hurrying after him, and the utterance
of his name in a female voice. He stopped
and turned.
“Oh, Mr. Southwell, y’r honor, for the love
o' Gawd!”
A rather pretty girl with auburn hair and
a slightly freckled face that was a little tear-
stained stood wringing her hands and. mak-
ing inarticulate noises expressive of distress.
He recognised her as the Molly Martin whom
the coxswain of the Governor’s gig had men-
tioned as being responsible for the abscond-
ing of the love-sick William Love.
“Well, my lass, pray, what’s your trouble?”
he inquired.
“Oh. Mr. Southwell, sir"—the girl began
to weep—“’tis poor Will Love (sob) —him
them cruel Injuns ha’ killed an’ ate. down
to Manly Cove (sob). I’ve but just heerd
* Twenty-five lashes.
toll ou it. (ISob, sob, sob.) Oh, y'r honor,
for th’ love o’ Gawd, tell me ’tain't true,
sir. ’Twas me was th’ cause of it, sir (sob)
—an’ I'm a wicked, bad girl (sob) —for sure
an’ sartain. Oh, Mr. Southwell, sir!” (sob)
Beauty—or, rather, femininity—in distress
has ever moved gallant seamen, and the
master’s mate of 11.M.5. Sirius was no ex-
ception to the rule. lie was genuinely
touched by the evident sincerity of the girl's
grief.
“Don’t cry, Molly—pray don’t take on so.
He’s no more killed and eaten than you or
me. A silly—a dam’ foolish —thing for him
to do; hut I make no doubt the blackfel-
lows’ll treat him kindly. I don’t believe
they’re cannibals at all. Cheer up, my girl,
lie’ll tire of living in the woods, and’s sure
to make back to the settlement. They all
do —those who run away. ’Tig hard enough
living here at Sydney Cove, but ten times
harder in those dark forests. lie’ll be glad
to come back and take his punishment. But
why did ye throw him over for the lobster?”
“Oh, sir, ’twas but to make him a little
jealous (sob). I did think he’d been u-
lookin’ at another woman (sob). Oh, indeed,
I never meant him to run away—l didn’t.
God forgive me (sob) for my wickedness.
D'ye railly think he’ll come back here again,
sir?”
“Of course, I do,” Mr. Southwell attempted
to reassure her. “We go down the harbor
again on Sunday for to fetch the Governor
back, and I dare swear we’ll find your Bill
Dove a-waiting for us, too. Take my word
for it—he’ll have had enough o’ them by the
week’s end—enough to last him a lifetime.”
“Oh, sir!” (sob).
Mr. Southwell regarded the girl curiously,
and then smiled at an idea that came to him.
“Now tell me, Molly Martin. Suppose I
find your Bill for you next Sunday and bring
him back safe and sound, will ye marry him
and become an honest woman? You know,
his Excellency is most solicitous that men
and women prisoners be married properly
by Parson Johnson rather than they should
live together anyhow. Maybe, when we find
him I might be able to persuade the Commo-
dore ’tis but a slight divarsion at Manly
the fellow’s been enjoying, and that you’re
willing to make a steady, honest fellow of
him if his punishment may be overlooked.
God bless my soul, yes—l don’t doubt but
Captain Phillip would be willing for to
pardon him. provided you was willing to do
as I’ve suggested. Would ye marry him
now if I was to fetch him back to ye?”
“Oh, sir, yes—if he was for to ax me.
Nobody’s ever axed me that yet. If he was
to ax me. sir. why I’d be the happiest girl
in Noo South Wales.”
“I’ll see that he asks you, Molly. And
the marine?”
The girl looked at him a little shyly—and
smiled faintly.
“Oh him, Mr. Southwell.” she whispered
—“why, he eon go to Hell!”
Some portion of the interesting event of
the following Sunday afternoon may be told
in Mr. Southwell’s own words. When he
arrived at Manly with the two boats he
anchored a little way from the beach for
security’s sake, and settled down to await
the return of his Excellency.
The people were now more numerous than usual,
Tiw! “e.vs s t.ir%".K
and several of them came close by the waterside
under the stem of our boats... .They wanted us much
to come on shore, which was impracticable. Indeed,
so intent seemed they on persuading us to it, that
after several waggish intimations from our people
that a sight of their ladies would be very agreeable,
they caused about 20 of them to pass close by us
to which, indeed, they seemed not at all averse.
They were proceeded by (an) ill-favored old beldam
of so disagreeable an aspect that we could not
determine whether a short harangue she made on
the occasion was a kind invitation to land, or a
sarckastic volley of abuse. Some of the young damsels
looked well enough, all things considered.
After this, when all had for some time been
quiet and still, we were not a little surprised to hear
a great tumult which proceeded from some who sate
farther back among the trees. At first the noise was
simply that of mens voices wrangling with the most
barbarous dissonance and savage agitation; but now
the clashing of spears and the strokes of lances
against the target was very distinctly heard. Looking
that way, therefore, we saw several of them engaged
in warm combat, darting at each other with true
savage fierceness. All now ran and seized their
weapons, which, by the way, must have been deposited
in the grass, as till now they had kept them out of
our sight, and a scene of great noise and confusion
ensued on all sides.
The women, who hitherto had all huddled together
a little way from our boat’s station, came running
down with every appearance of terror, and calling
to us repeatedly... .What those females meant who
thus precipitately came down to us, 1 am at a loss
to conclude, but they seemed to supplicate our
assistance. The battle continued long, and was. now
and then interrupted with "ois.v. expostulation's, in
the midst of which the contending parties would,
however, frequently launch a spear at each other
with all the rage of madmen. They are dexterous
to a degree in the use of the target, and during the
affray, which lasted an hour, I did not see one of
them completely disabled, though frequently forced
to quit the field

talk together as though nothing at all had happened,
and some others of the multitude would walk down
and gaze at us just as before. The women were less
discomposed, and many of the men, though a part
came down to the shore to discouise with us in the
usual way, and apparently regardless of what was
going on among the rest.
I must not omit that in one of their expostulations,
in which the women now and then endeavored to
assist, our old Jezebel, the matron, to use a homely
sea phrase, “got herself capsized heels oyer head ” a
sign, perhaps, that they pay no great respect to
the decisions of the ladies, at least on such occasions;
and I rather took it as a rude mode of suggesting a
hint that they deemed the business she had engaged
in as impertinent and officious—in short, no concern
of hers. . . .. .
I have only to add that, when seemingly tired
either with the reality or the strong semblance of
fighting with each other, they took it into their
heads to begin with us by throwing several spears
from behind the trees that fell little short of our
boats. I was unwilling to exert the power we had
over those poor wretches, and finding they still con-
tinued to lurk behind the trees with every appearance
of hostility, I thought proper, the sun being just on
the horizon, to haul further out from the beach,
interesting myself with now and then presenting a
musket when I perceived any of them preparing to
aim from behind the thicket... .Whenever their spears
were thrown a barbarous yell \vas raised in applause
as I concluded, of the warrior ; .and in this horrid
exclamation the voice Of the sooty sirens was very
distinguishable, who not long before had endeavor’d
to allure us to their inhospitable beach in vain.
Dusk came down over the pretty bay, the
dense forest ashore, and the high hill behind,
and the Governor’s party did not march out
of the bush. So Mr. Southwell decided that
they would sleep in the boats, and await his
Excellency’s appearance in the morning.
Accordingly, he served out a tot of rum all
round, and some biscuit, and called to
Patou, the'coxswain of the Governor's gig,
to do likewise. The boats were always pro-
visioned when upon such expeditions as the
present one. When the moon rose about 9
o’clock, all was still and quiet ashore, and
nothing save their tiny camp-fires amongst
the bushes gave any indication of the prox-
imity of the natives.
Wrapped in his boat-cloak, Mr. Southwell
was dozing uncomfortably in the stern sheets
of the cutter, when he felt his left arm
grasped tightly above the elbow. He woke
with a start to hear the coxswain whisper:
“I think them black warmints is a-tryin’ to
take us be surprise, sir. Look, there’s a
fellie a-swimmin’ off to us. Can’t ye see
his head in the moonlight—over there? He's
nigh alongside of us—yet he seems to be
alone. There he is, sir.”
Mr. Southwell looked in the direction the
man was pointing. Sure enough, a dark
head was slowly approaching the cutter
which lay nearest to the shore. There was
no doubt that he was by himself.
“Some thief —after what lie may pick up,”
muttered Mr. Southwell. “Some of them are
great thieves.”
But, to the astonishment of the two
watchers, as the swimmer came closer the
moonlight made it unmistakable that he was
a white man. Presently he was alongside
the cutter, and Mr. Southwell and the cox-
swain helped him over the side. lie was
entirely naked, and shivered with cold.
“D—n it, it must be that fellow Love, the
absconder. Are you William Love?” asked
Mr. Southwell.
The man nodded, his teeth chattering.
“Give him a tot of rum, Coxs’n,” ordered
Mr. Southwell. “And, here, put this round
you,” as ho took off his boat-cloak and passed
it to the shivering refugee.
“Well,” said Mr. Southwell presently,
when the overproof spirit had a little re-
stored the man, “you’re a pretty dam’ fool,
ain’t ye, Will Love? In the name of Heaven,
what made you cast in your lot with the
blacks?”
Love did not reply, and Mr. Southwell
went on.
“Listen to me, Will Love. Back at the
Camp there’s two sorts of receptions all
ready for ye when we return. If it should
prove that you are simply a deserter, who’s
run away to please* himself —well, the drum-
mers and the halberds and the cat-o’-nine-
tails will be the principal features of your
welcome. But if it should appear (and of
course there is only your word for it, which
cannot be gainsaid) that the natives detained
you here by force —why, God bless my soul,
ye’ll be regarded as the. Prodigal Son. I’d
advise ye to play the nrodigal. myself. And,
by the way, there was a. red-headed wench
asked me to keep a look out for ye. Love—
one who tells all lobsters and leathernecks
to go to Hell. So ye’d better make y’r choice
speedily, and stick to it.”
“Thankee, sir,” said Mr. Love simply.

SATISFACTION
with oneself—the knowledge that you have
succeeded where perhaps others have failed—
such satisfaction is good. A bright optimistic
temperament and calm mental poise fit an
individual for doing his or her best. Such a
sound, healthy state of mind is rendered
difficult, if not impossible, when a person is
troubled with digestive disturbances. Tired-
ness, that languid, heavy feeling, is the result
of stomach, bowel and liver irregularities. A
few doses of Beecham’s Pills, however, will
regulate the organs to healthy activity.
