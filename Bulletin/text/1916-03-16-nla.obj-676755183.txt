Songs from the Trenches
Capt. C. W. Blaekall, who makes no claim
to be a poet, furnishes another fine instal-
ment of the real thing in bis Songs from the
Trenches (Lane, Is.).
This‘is the song of the blooming trench:
It is sung by us, and it's sung by the French;
It's probably sung by the German Huns;
But it isn't all beer, and skittles, and buns.
It's a song of water, and mud, and slime,
And keeping your eyes skinned all the time.
Though the putrid “bully'’ may kick up a
stench ,
Remember, you've got to stick to your
trench —■
Yes, stick like glue to your trench.
It is a song of digging parties, where
there is :—■
Nothing of any particular note.
Sixty-four Williams stopped his ivith his
throat,
And I got one through the sleeve of my coat.
It’s a song of “The Padre” : —•
An' if ’e 'ears yer cussin',
As yer fillin' up ther bags,
'E jest says, “Fumigate your throat,''
An' 'anas yer out some fags.
It’s a song of the young private shot in
the head at daybreak -
We didn’t know s much about ’im,
For there wasn’t, much ter know.
'E was just fresh out from England,
And didn’t know the risk,
But we got ’is name and number
From ’is ’dentification disc.
It’s a song of the guns, and of “the dozy
little, cosy little dug-out underground,”
which is also “the frowsy little, lousy little
dug-out underground” ; and of the smell of
the trench:—
A peculiar stench is the smell of the trench —
Of that there is no denying;
But at every post what strikes you most
Is the smell of bacon frying.
The mouldy beef of some past relief,
I grant you, is somewhat trying;
But to counteract, you’ve always the fact
Of the smell of bacon frying.
At another time the chloride of lime
Will almost start you crying;
But banish the niff by having a sniff
At the smell of bacon frying.
The night has been wet, and you see with
regret
Odd garments hung out drying;
The odor is quaint, and you bless the saint
Who invented bacon frying.
This trench-poet’s touch is neat and true.
Stendhal on Love
When Stendhal, in the early part of the
19th century, wrote his IJe L’Amour, lie
prophesied that his ideas about love would
have to wait for the 20th century before they
were adequately comprehended. He was
right. The first and second editions of his
great work were phenomenal failures.
Stendhal, born in 1753, may be regarded as
one of the pioneers of the suffragettes. He
pleaded for the education and freedom of
women, but hardly for the modern reason.
The free and cultured woman, he contended,
was more lovable, and a better lover, than
the uneducated woman of his time. No Eng-
lish traftslation of the whole of Stendhal’s
essay being in existence, though a selec-
tion of his maxims has been put into print,
Philip Sidney AVoolf and Cecil N. Sidney
Woolf have translated the work, as Stendhal
On Love { Duckworth, per Sydney Book Club).
Stendhal’s central idea in his pseudo-
scientific examination of love is “crystallisa-
tion” —a word invented by himself to ex-
press the essential characteristic of love—
the capacity of the lover not only to endow
the loved one with qualities which do not
exist, but to love that other solely because
of these imaginary qualities. “I mean by
crystallisation a certain fever in the imagi-
nation which transforms past recognition
what is, as often as not,. a quite ordinary
object, and makes it a thing apart.” Your
fiancee, so proudly introduced to us the
other day,' looked to us a quite ordinary
object; but you saw her through a strange
haze of adoration, and worshipped the imagi-
nary qualities with which you had endowed
her stereotyped features. It was you who
made, her beautiful or charming, or allur-
ing : naturally you loved her for just that
beauty, that charm, that allure. You don’t
believe us? Call round, after you’ve been
married to her, some 12 months hence, and
we’ll lend you our copy of Stendhal On
Love. You may love her just as much, or
probably more, then; but you won’t love her
for the special qualities that you first en-
dowed her with. The crystals will have dis-
solved.
Henry Beyle, whose pen-name was Stend-
hal, had a varied career, chiefly military;
but he had other adventures, the character
of which may be gleaned from the statement
that he made his entrance into the world
“with the fixed intention of being a seducer
of women.” Evidently, from the tenor of
Stendhal’s writing, this was a popular pro-
fession in those days. His attitude colors
all his observations. And in one of his pre-
faces he warns his reader that his book will
be incomprehensible to all who have not
found time to play the fool. . And in another
preface he stipulates that his readers should
lie limited to those who have been, in all
their lives, unhappy for love for at least six
months. Any takers, nowadays?
Stendhal got his conception of crystallisa-
tion by seeing a branch of a tree taken from
the abandoned depths of a salt-mine. The
bare twigs were covered with brilliant crys-
tals, the smallest twigs were arrayed
with an infinity of sparkling, dazzling dia-
monds : “it was impossible to recognise the
original branch.” Anyway, when you re in
love, you don’t want to. In love, it is only
the illusion formed by ourselves which we
enjoy. There is no need, therefore, for
beauty in the girl we love. The only thing is
that her uglipess be not too great to form
an obstacle to love. “The lover soon comes
to find his mistress beautiful, such as she
is, without thinking of ideal beauty.”
&
Stendhal is often extremely acute in his,
no doubt, wide experience: “One of life’s
miseries is that the happiness of seeing and
talking to the object of our love leaves no
distinct memories behind. The soul, it
seems, is too troubled by its emotions for
that which causes or accompanies them to
impress it. The soul and its sensations are
one and the same. It is perhaps because
these pleasures cannot be used up by volun-
tary recollection that they return again and
again with such force....lt looks as if, by
a curious whim of tfie heart, the charm,
which the woman we love can communicate,
w r ere greater than that which she herself
possesses.... If one is sure of the love of a
woman, one examines to se,e if she is more
or less beautiful'; if one is uncertain of her
THE “REAL THING."
“How often in the midst of a charge in peace
I have caught the yearning cry of a comrade, ‘Don-
nenvetter! If only it were the real tiling.’”
—The Crown Prince.
—Cartoon by Louis Raemuekers.
heart there is no time to think of her face
■.... Extremely lovely women cause less sur-
prise the second day.... Such is the empire
of modesty that a woman of feeling betrays
her sentiments for her lover sooner by deed
than by word.... The glance is the great
weapon of virtuous coquetry. With a
glance one may say everything, and yet one
can always deny a glance; for it cannot be
repeated textually... .Tears are the
supreme smile.... Everyone in France
knows the anecdote of Mademoiselle de
Sommery, who, caught in flagrant delict by
her lover, flatly denied the fact. On his
protesting, she replied: “Very well, I see
you don’t love me any more: you believe
what you see before what' I tell y0u”....
What an excellent counsellor would a man
not find in a wife, if only she could think !
....At the end of a visit you always finish
by treating a lover better than you meant to.”
Stendhal is not cynical: he hadn’t time
to be. His apparent cynicisms are the
mere innocent observations of a man-of-his-
world. Quite casually he begins a chapter
With what was a commonplace—to him and
to his age. He is not trying to shock us
when he observes, “I have lived a good deal
of late with the ballet-girls of the Teatro
Del Sol, at Valencia. People assure me
that many of them are very chaste.” Thus
he states an interesting fact, and then calmly
proceeds to investigate and discuss the reason.
‘‘There are light, capricious women every-
where,” he remarks, “but in general the
Viennese are faithful and in no way
coquettes.” But, having a scientist’s passion
for exactitude, he feels compelled to add:
“When I say that they are faithful, I mean
to the lover of their own choice, for husbands
are the same at Vienna as everywhere else.”
The volume is interesting, but it suffers
from lack of compression, and Stendhal’s
alleged scientific treatment of Love is that of
a mere amateur. But, considering the age
in which he wrote, the book is a remarkable
anticipation of the modern scientific attitude
to Love.

“Jane” butts into the great flapperature
controversy: It is with pained surprise that
I note that no controversialist has so far
mentioned either Victoria Cross or Elinor
Glyn. When I was a flapper, some two
years ago, the palely pornographic novels
of these ladies had a tremendous vogue—
especially Elinor. To read The Vicissitudes
of Vaseline while smoking a cigarette was
cvusidered by all flappers with any pre-
tentions to chic to be absolutely the last
word in daring Bohemianism. And why
has no one mentioned the flapper poets?
Ella Wheeler Wilcox and Lawrence Hope
(absolutely the limit, my dear!) and Byron.
(Have you read Don Juan?) And why is
everyone so keen on impressing the fact
that occasional flappers read occasional
good books? There seems a certain want
of graciousness in expecting intellect from
the flapper, in addition to the charm she
always possesses.
Australian
One of the most characteristic, and cer-
tainly the pluckiest, magazine in Australia
is The Inlander, a quarterly illustrated
magazine dealing with National Intelests
from the Outbacker’s point of view, edited
by Bev. John Flynn, and published by the
Home Mission Board of the Australian Pres-
byterian Church (Gordon and Gotcli, 4s.
per annum). Ho not be scared by these
preliminaries: Tiie Inlander is true to
type, manly, iuteresting, original, and does
not obtrude its religious views. lbe held
of this fine mission practically includes the
tremendous area of pathetically blank map
that comprises what we call the heart ot the
continent. The trouble with Austialia is
that she is suffering from enlargement or
the heart. In the latest issue of this
magazine J. C. Gibson treats patriotically
of the factors in the problem of development
of the Territory; and there ,is a careful
and comprehensive article upon the pearling
industry, the photographs illustrating which
are admirably elucidative. It is, indeed, in
its photographic illustrations of the little-
known interior that The Inlander makes
its unique claim on the interest of the dwel-
ler on the continental rim. These pictures
stress the astonishing variety and interest
of that lost Atlantis submerged in distance.
Readers of the books by Mrs. AEneas Gunn
will welcome the photographs of the memo-
rials over the graves, of the.“Fizzer H and the
“Maluka” (.Eneas James Gunn).
Nora Collisson has constructed, with con-
siderable ingenuity and some sense of drama,
a patriotic pageant play entitled To the Day.
It was first performed by amateurs in Bris-
bane for the Red Cross funds, and may be
performed without fee for any patriotic pur-
pose. In its published form it is on sale for
Is. 6d. The author has made effective use of
quotations from famous speeches and declara-
tions made by the leaders of the participants
in the war. The theme of the pageant shows
the Dominions jealous and discontented with
Britain, until Germany’s act unites them in
one patriotism. Considered as literature the
play is merely a patchwork of well-known
quotations; but as the libretto of a pageant
it evidently suffices. Its production in Bris-
bane was a decided success.

J. B. Howie writes for the Australian
Peace Alliance, Vic., its first pamphlet,

The Spirit of the Bush Fire, Book IV., by
J. M. Wliitfeld (Edward Lee, Sydney; Is.
3d.), consists of several Australian fairy
stories, some of which appeared in Sydney
Mail and Town and Country Journal,
and, judging by the inclusion of three
illustrations by George Lambert, . they
were first printed a, long time ago. The
appearance of the book is not attractive; but
the author attempts, with some success, to
acclimatise the fairy story in Australia.
J*
With the best wishes to be nice, A. St.
John Adcock fails quite to understand the
Australasian. His Australasia Triumphant
(Simpkin-, Marshall, 2s. (id.) is an account
of our share in the war up to the present—
for it is going to be a much larger share
before the account is settled ; together with
“a guess at the spirit and inner significance
of this wonderful uprising of our Austral-
asian kinsfolk —at the ideal for which they
are fighting with such glorious heroism and
for which so many of them have ungrudg-
ingly laid down their lives.” His narrative is
an interesting refutation of Bernhardi’s fatu-
ous dictum : “The colonies can be completely
ignored so far as concerns any European
theatre of war,” .and his photographic illus-
trations are adequate; but it is an outsider
who is writing, and his “guess” at our ideals
is inevitably superficial. And in his narra-
tive he makes the mistakes natural to an out-
sider. The worst is the assertion that the
Huns rescued from the Emden were sent
in H.M.A.S. Sydney to Australia! And he
pictures “the vast crowd which gathered at
Sydney Harbor to welcome with storms of
cheering the triumphant Captain Glossop
and his men” (of the Sydney), and which
“broke into a generous ovation for the hero
of the Emden as bis .conquerors brought him
in”! Those storms of cheering are not yet,
but they will come. And bis attitude
toward the Anzacs is, quite pardonably in an
Englishman, hopelessly wrong. A poem at
the beginning of the book is titled “Britons
All!” Well, we’re .not Britons all: we’re
more Australian than ever we were, that’s
all. The war has merely waked the latent
patriotism of the Australian: instead of
being shrinkingly Australian, we’ve become
furiously Australian; and there is not one
Anzac convalescing in England who forgets
for one instant that he is different. He is
proud of bis connection with the family,
but he’s grown up, and prouder of his own
individuality.

deceased American Judge written do". u a

California. The old Judge is

for he has seized the chance of the J, t o’
contribute another volume, entitled if °
Letters from the Living Dead Man hv Pi!!
Barker (Kider, l.oadoa, *b,L2
Library). 8
In the living dead man’s first communi-
cation he says, “11 hen I come back and te 1
you the story of this war, as seen from the
other side, you will know more than all the
Chancellories of the nations.” Unfortu
nately, we must call the astral gentleman
a liar ; for he tells us nothing that we ha™
not read before in the literature ofS
war. Maybe “X” was able to read those
books up there. Elsa Barker calls attention
to one of the letters, written, she asserts one
Lour before the sinking of the Lusitania’and
nine hours before the Writer knew it’ but
this page defies anybody to find in that docu-
ment one definite prophecy that could refer
to that catastrophe. Like all the other let-
ters it consists of a series of vague asser-
tions that could apply to anything. He
does not even mention the name of the ship
though, curiously enough, he mentions it in
a letter written later. And in one letter
he states that May 15 is a significant date.
Elsa Barker, seeking for its significance, can
mention only that it was the date of the
reception by Germany of the U.S. note on
the sinking of the Lusitania—and we know
what effect that had, and also of “the demon-
strations in Italy that precipitated the entry
of that country into the war.” “X,” in his
ideas of significant dates, was a painfully
poor guesser. Still, we are interested in
hearing how the inhabitants of the astral,
plane are getting on. Owing to the-feelings
of hatred .and suffering by the
war. the astral world at present is a* very
unpleasant place of sojourn—rather like
Purgatory. It is full of demons, among which..
of course, is the astral self of the Kaiser.
“X’s” astral body is “a well-lubricated
though tenous machine.” One of the demons,
which has now' been driven back to its lair in
the bowels of the planet—nice new's for our
miners ! —had “a gross bluish, bag-like body,
with a long, fat tail covered with bristles,
arms and legs like elongated bags, and a head
that wms a larger and half-submerged bag in
the rolls of its monstrous neck”.... And it
“spat and drooled its venom toward the sur-
face of the planet. . . .What the nourishment
might be which had kept it together I re-
frain from telling you.” And “X” adds to
our knowledge, and also explains certain
deficiencies in his narrative, by stating that
his work has been hampered by his ignorance
of the German language. And, apparently,
a knowledge of A-U-M is necessary. A-U-M
is “the One, the Many, and the Union between
them : the Self, the Not-Self, and the Nega-
tion of separateness.” Obviously.
The deceased explains, too, the reason for
the w 7 ar: all this horror and suffering is
necessary that a new race may be born in
the United States ! It was about time! And
he informs us that Abraham Lincoln is on
guard just now, probably dictating Wilson’s
innumerable notes. The deceased Judge
meets Nietzsche, Satan, whom he interviews,
and a sylph, whom he converts. Also, lie
claims, after the event, to have inspired an
American cartoonist. But mostly he is con-
cerned with “black magic” in the United
States. And he issues this awful warning:
“Beware of any man or woman who by nor-
mal or abnormal means seeks to get posses-
sion of the fluids of your body, especially the
blood and the other vital fluids.” Beware!
It is curious that a publisher will publish
and an audience will read these puerile and
hysterical drivellings of a silly woman, with-
out a spark of originality in the whole book.
The volume condemns itself, for it contains
just the stupidities that a foolish woman, let-
ting her mind leak over into print, would
write about the war. Possibly, however, this
page under-rates Elsa Barker’s, and her pub-
lisher’s, flair, for sensational fiction.

There is a deep interest for Australians
in Norman Wilkinson’s color sketches of
The Dardanelles (Longmans, Green, per
Dymock’s Library; 17s. 6d.). Interesting
chapters deal with the Suvla Bay landing,
the trawlers and the submarines; but the
value of the work lies in the 30 full-page
plates in color, reproduced from water-
colors made on the spot. The obviously
accurate topography in these pictures dissi-
pates the many fancy pictures of the Pay
danelles done in dugouts in the trenches o
Fleet-street for the London illustrat
weeklies. From the coast Achi Baba 100
a mere gently-sloping mound above ■
coastal cliffs; and Sari Bair from the Sa
landing is little more conspicuous. A P
and-ink drawing of Anzac, however, i
cates the almost inaccessible steepness or
cliffs; and a color sketch forcibly Llustn

A remarkably sincere letter
from a Mosman lady, Miss
Lily Hurt, of 12 Spit Road,

to all women in poor health,
especially to those who go
daily to business. _ It tells
what Clements Tonic can do
for them.
Clements Tonic will benefit
you as it did the lady who
wrote this letter.

“I want you to tell every girl and woman who have to go to " or

done, how much better they would feel if they took Clements lonic.
“I was worn out, always tired and ill. Medical advice suggestet

RHEUMATISM
Its Cause—and Cure.
Rheumatism is caused by _ a curious,
poisonous acid in the blood. This acid, just
like tiny pieces of broken glass with rough
edges, settles in the joints and muscles and
causes that awful agonising pain of back-
ache, rheumatism and gout, gravel, and the
burning sensation of inflammation of the
bladder, etc.
De Witt’s Kidney and Bladder Pills
strengthen the kidneys and drive the
poisouous pain-causing acid right out of the
system.
To cure rheumatism or any other form of
kidney trouble you must positively gQt rid
of the cause —the poisonous uric acid.
Remember to do this a real remedy must
pass through the kidneys and the bladder
and not through the bowels, as most kidney
pills do. When you see the urine change to
a muddy bluish color —a feature which dis-
tinguishes De Witt’s Kidney and Bladder
Pills from all others —you know beyond all
doubt that they have put their healing
touch on the right spot—the kidneys and
the bladder. A wonderful pill—straight to
the kidneys—that is why De Witt’s pills
give such amazingly quick relief —every
time. A permanent cure follows in almost
every case. Look for that blue-colored urine.
Don’t waste a single hour. Go to your
chemist at once and ask him for a 2s. 9d.
box of De Witt’s Kidney and Bladder Pills,
which are made expressly for kidney and
bladder troubles.
They will cure every one of the above
symptoms no matter how long or how badly
you have suffered.

“It gives me great pleasure to inform you that I
have been completely cured of the Tobacco Habit by
your wonderful Tobacco Specific, after using tobacco
heavily for seven years, sometimes Boz. to lOoz. in

tobacco, and, although I am continually in the com-

smoke; therefore I consider the cure permanent.
“My general health is now perfect; all my former
complaints, such as irregular Heart Action, Dizziness,
Nervousness and Stomach Trouble, which I have every
reason to believe were caused through the use of
tobacco, have entirely disappeared, and are only re-

The Triumphant Husband.
I knew a man (so sad is life!)
Who loved another fellow’s wife.
But love’s a very queer affair;
These two were not a guilty pair.
He could not win a kiss from Kate,
Although he was importunate.
He failed in each nefarious plan
Because she loved another man
Who did not care for her at all:
You see, she simply couldn’t fall.
Her bland, smooth husband knew quite
well
What ailed her, but he wouldn’t tell;
And as he soothed her still and kissed,
She snbodled. .. .How could she resist?
The man who wooed was hopeless quite;
The man she wanted wouldn’t bite;
And so the smiling husband, he
Retained his fine monopoly,
And both the others were his friends:
Love moves to these mysterious ends.
She lived a chaste and faithful wife,
And wept about it all her life.
The man she wouldn’t love (they say)
Found solace in the usual way.
The man who wouldn’t coodle-doo
Got his deserts and wed a shrew.
The moral of this tale, maybe,
Is very clear to you and me,
And as it’s clear beyond all doubt
There is no need to write it out.

SELWYN RIDER.
The Warning.
The doctor warned me years ago,
His manner earnest-toned and grave,
That many days I could not know
Unless I made myself a slave
To staider rules. Life would be wrecked
Unless I grew more circumspect.
He mapped for me a track austere,
And said he walked it, for delight
In ruddy# health ; it knew not beer
Nor gladness of the gilded night.
Such paths, despite the sacrifice,
Were really pleasant, though precise.
I took his warning to my soul,
Not quite at once, but some months after ;
And went my way and still am whole —
There is a medicine in laughter!
My head still flaunts its native red —
I’m much alive ; the doctor’s dead !

The Fountain.
One time a fountain meant to me
A work of sculptured symmetry,
Where brilliant brain and artist skill
The stone had fashioned to their will.
A thing of graceful curve and poise
To fill the brain with subtle joys.
But fame and wealth can siviftly pass,
As summer winds blow through the grass.
* * * *
Art and its glamor! What to me and these,
My brothers, hunched beneath the kind park
trees ?
Matters it be the fountain nobly planned,
And fashioned featly by a master hand,
So that its limpid waters ease our thirst,
And cool the brow with bitter thoughts
accurst?
Within its basin city sparrows fling
Its diamond drops on dusty breast and
wing.
Ah, Christ is not unheeding of our needs —-
We who, among his flowers, came up as
weeds!
Who thirsted on the cross, in mercy bends,
And, through the fountain, healing water
sends.

The Dogs that Have Had Their Day.
I laugh at the world that laughs frankly
back,
With waters that wimple and skies that
are gay;
And here, as I trudge down the homeward
track,
While muscles soften and sinews slack,
I give you—The dogs that have had their
day!
Why should we weep till we’re out of the
wood
And the desert ahead stretches sere and
grey?
The after-taste of our youth is good,
And Memory’s a dancing and joyous flood _
That bears up the dogs that have had their
day!
We scoff at the cynics who’d poison life,
We know that for all things we have to
pay,
For the kiss of a jade or the thrust of a
knife;
But we come out men at the end of the
strife,
The battered old dogs that have had their
day!
We do not whimper or kiss the r0d....
But the woman who ’thralled us for ever
and aye,
Though we lost her far back on the path
we’ve trod,
We may clasp again on the knees of God,
Who cares for the dogs that have had
their day!

THE MYSTERY OF A LITTLE MAN
AND THE FUTURE OF A CON-
TINENT.
There was a large and spacious vagueness
about the reasons advanced for the flitting
of W. M. Hughes to London. He went
away in a steamer that he wasn’t supposed
to be going by, bolting surreptitiously up the
gangway in the middle of the night disguised
as a Lord Mayor or something, and dis-
appearing in a stage whisper. These are
uncertain times, and it was doubtless right
of Hughes to take precautions; but now
that he has reached the other end, “bronzed
and well,” and has “gazed upon the barges
floating on the tawny Thames” (vide
cables), it seems about time that Australia
heard something of the reasons which im-
pelled him to skip by the light o’ the moon, as
it were. The explanations given of the little
man’s departure prior to his sailing con-
sisted of words without meaning. There was
at first something about an invitation to an
Imperial Conference, but this was hurriedly
withdrawn, and then it turned out that there
were “matters to be discussed with the
British Government,” and Mr. Hughes
was “going to explain his views about
metals,” and so on and so forth—nothing
that anyone could understand or was meant
to understand. Nor was there anything to
suggest that a Fisher at £5OOO a year could
not attend to all these indefinite “matters”
and make such explanations of the situation
regarding zinc and copper as w r ere necessary.
This paper is not going to say yet that
Hughes should not have gone to London.
There may be good reasons for his visit.
What it does say is that whatever these
reasons may be Australians are not yet
acquainted with them, that up to date there
has been nothing but hocus-pocus available,
and that Australia is in the dark about quite
enough things without having a Prime Mini-
ster added to the number. There was work
for Hughes to do in Australia —a man’s
work,, too —and to The Bulletin, at any
rate, it has not been made clear that what
he has to do in London is of equal import-
ance to what is not being done in Australia.
* * * *
There are great dangers confronting the
people of Australia —some of them almost as
sinister as the menacing Hun. Not the least
of these is the possibility of the Common-
wealth being stampeded into an organic
Imperialism such as is dimly foreshadowed
by orators who blither at banquets about the
Empire, and tightening the bonds, and
“giving the Oversea Dominions a voice in an
Imperial Parliament,” and all that sort of
nebulous mush. On the surface the words
these banqueting orators use are without
point. Beneath them are fish-hooks and
barbed wire on which the democracy of this
country could easily find its liberties im-
paled. None of these people are Australian
Nationalists. All of them have been satu-
rated with antipathy to the idea of an Aus-
tralia growing to nationhood in an atmo-
sphere of national independence. And days
like this are particularly favorable to the
growth of treacherous conspiracies to entan-
gle popular liberties. Almost every morning
the Australian citizen may read in one or
other of the newspapers the remarks of
someone or other about “Australia having
entered into full partnership” and “taken her
place” and done various other things which
are mostly reverberating phrases and verbal
waterholes from which the moisture long
ago evaporated. Whan The Bulletin reads
these things it shudders, and it shudders
more when it remembers the pliancy and
servility of politicians and the susceptibility
of men to wander after strange gods and
drink unfamiliar liquors. Hypnotised by
the war and “members for Anzac” and other
circumstances, it is not difficult to conceive
of the Australian people getting into a
frame of mind in which they might be led
into compacts and relationships and under-
takings fatal to the realisation of their older
ideals.
Perhaps Hughes is to be trusted not to
be corrupted, but The Bulletin would feel
much more satisfied if he was working in
the open at home instead of discussing
“matters” with politicians somewhere else.
Australia has not participated in this war
because of any liking for Imperialism as a
system or desire to become involved in the
external policies of Europe and India and
Africa and Canada. She is in the fray to
defend her own liberties against a pirate
aiming at the creation of a world-wide
tyranny-—not as a prelude to handing her
liberties over to any control exterior to Aus-
tralia. And her experience of war is not
going to make her particularly anxious to
have any more of it than is necessary. None
of the schemes for creating an Imperial edi-
fice ever appealed to the mass of the Aus-
tralian people, and it is safe to say that
their appetite for one is no keener now than
it was before. But most of these schemes
have been the finished article, with the roof
on and the pictures on the wall and the
lawn carefully trimmed, and we have known
what we have been invited to step into.
What has now to be watched is the work of
the underground engineer, the tactics of
those “interests” and “authorities” whose
immediate object is to induce Australia to
adjust her domestic and industrial affairs to
the exigencies of a foreign policy. The little
that Australians heard on this point before
the war is nothing compared with what is
going to be produced later on, and if we are
not very careful the point of it is going to
cut deeply into Australian national senti-
ment. The Hughes and Fisher influence
in London may be a corrective, though The
Bulletin would not care to risk much on
Fisher nowadays, and it would also like to
understand what Hughes is after a lot
more clearly than it does now.
WHEAT AND SOSH AND A SCRAP OF
PAPER.
When Hughes produced the scheme that
h ’d been hatched by the State and Federal
Ministries for marketing the Australian
\vheat harvest, the plan looked a good one.
The circumstances were exceptional, and
Cocky, being a disorganised, individualistic
sort of animal, seemed more than usually
liable to be skinned. The problem before the
States and Commonwealth was to devise
means by which the earnings of Australian
wheat-growers would be protected in the
fullest degree, and the nation thus derive the
greatest possible benefit from the sale of a
staple product. To achieve this it was
arranged that the whole harvest should be
pooled, advances made against delivery to
agents, and the wheat marketed in London
by a Board or sold to Australian millers at
London parity. At the conclusion of all
these operations the amount left in the pool,
after discharge of freight and other costs of
marketing, would be divided amongst the pro-
ducers in proportion to their respective
claims as determined by the volume of their
deliveries. It appeared a wise and practical
step for the various Governments to take—a
simple adaptation of the co-operative princi-
ple of marketing. The arguments, in favor
of it were irrefutable ; those against it merely
banal, except so far as they touched the
parsimonious character of the advance
granted against shipment and the extortion-
ate buying-charges conceded to agents acting
on behalf of the different Governments. The
scheme has been in operation about four
months, and, in a general way, has been a
great success, illustrating in a very striking
manner the benefits of co-operation and in-
telligent direction by the State. At any rate,
it did this until the other day, when it started
to illustrate something else. The National
Government agreed to increase the advance
by Gd., and then, producing the War Pre-
cautions Act, it announced that wheat would
be sold to millers in Australia at 4s. 9d. a
bushel, that flour would be £ll.Bs. a ton, and
that the inhabitants of cities who went to the
baker’s shop would get a 41b. loaf for GjW.
The principle of the scheme was thus turned
upside down. Hughes had declared that,
“unless we can find means to transport our
produce, these high prices for wheat and
meat and wool are only glittering baubles
which mock our plight.” and he promised
that “the Commonwealth and the States
would make the scheme as profitable and
helpful to the farmers as possible.” But after
Hughes spoke Pearce heard the yell
for a cheap loaf and came to the conclusion
that there was too much “glittering bauble.”
Therefoi’e. allegedly as a war precaution, he
resolved to rub 4id. of glitter off the bushel
of wheat when certain * specially-favored
people bought it. #
Apparently the essence of Pearce’s argu-
ment is this: —
Unless the scheme had been introduced wheat and
flour would have been dirt-cheap in Australia.
The Governments’ intervention has made wheat
dearer.
The Australian Government, having thus increased
the price, is entitled to get for the consumers in
Australia a special concession.
As the original agreement has been varied by in-
creasing the advance to growers from 3s. to 3s. 6d.
per bushel, it is futile to speak of a breach of faith
when the agreement is varied in any other respect.
Pearce would have been on safer controver-
sial ground if he had retained the last part of
his argument for private consumption. The
amount of the advance to growers was gov-
erned wholly by market considerations, the
safety of the pool, the availability of trans-
port and apprehension as to freedom of ocean
navigation. It was expressly stated that if
events justified larger payments from the
pool before the final distribution, such pay-
ments would be made. The inaugural and
tentative limitation to an advance of 3s. was
merely a provisional measure of financial
prudence. The increase to 3s. 6d. is thus
merely’ part of the original bargain, and
Pearce knows it. But reduction of the price
at which the grower’s wheat or any part of
it is sold below the London parity is not part
of the bargain. It is a clear breach of it.
And Pearce knows that, too. His justifica-
tion for breaking the agreement at one point
by showing that it has been kept at another,
and arguing therefrom that the breaking was
a fair thing, suggests that he would gain
great distinction in a Divinity class.
Pearce has produced a rambling, inconse-
quential yarn about wheat at 2s. 6d. in Aus-
tralia being calamitous because it was cheap,
and wheat at ss. 14d. being disastrous
because it was dear. What he no doubt
meant to say to the Australian people was
this: —-
Look here! This scheme has had a success far
beyond anything anticipated either by Governments
or growers of wheat. The farmers are getting an
extraordinary advantage through the cheap freights
secured by the Government, which are less than is
being paid for Argentine wheat, though Argentina is
much nearer London. It seems unreasonable that the
Australian consumer should have to pay more for
bread because Australian Governments have utilised
the State machinery to. get a high figure for Aus-
tralian wheat in another country; so we’ll give the
consumer a cut as well as the producer.
There is a good deal of sense in this, though
if adopted as a general rule of conduct for
Governments it would land them in all sorts
of unexpected holes. There can be no justi-
fication for the State either utilising its
powers or neglecting its obligations so as to
impoverish the people. But that point is
irrelevant to this particular matter, the crux
of which is, not whether bread at 6|d. spells
relief from penury while a loaf at 7d. or Bd.
means a degraded social severance from the
lighter and brighter things of life, but
whether any State should break a compact
and tear up its scrap of paper. And to that,
whatever Pearce may say, and however
desirable cheap bread in Australia may be,
this paper says No. If necessary it says
No 15 times. There was no compulsion,
moral or economic, upon the Government in
this case. There are, on the other hand,
strong moral and economic reasons why the
Federal and State Governments should have
stood by the undertaking they bound them-
selves to. The Bulletin believes that by
co-operative enterprise among primary pro-
ducers, acting under the auspices or direc-
tion of the State and municipalities, great
advantages would accrue to the community ;
that State Socialism should be worked for
ard encouraged by every patriotic citizen.
The Bulletin further believes that a great
majority of the Australian people agree with
this —that it is the direction in which the
serious thought of the world has been moving
in modern years. And, that being so. any
action by a Government which weakens the
public estimate of the State’s good faith
when dealing with any section of the nation,
or in prosecuting any enterprise to which it
is committed, is entitled to the cold eve and
the emphatic curse. If anyone tells this paper
that it is so important to secure for the
populace bread at 6Jd. a loaf that the Federal
Government should crayfish out of a bargain
the terms of which were explicit, and intro-
duce a fresh clause because of desire to grant
a preference in a special direction, the only
possible reply is that such a contention
shows deplorable lack of appreciation of the
grounds on which people secure damages at
law for breach of contract. Morally the
action of the Governments has been as
crooked as a dog’s hind-leg. The Buiietin
is not asking Cocky to tie his whiskers in
crepe and consider himself a much-misused
person. Taking it all round, he has done
very well. The 4|d. a bushel he has been
spoofed for will not affect him much. Pro-
bably as an individual he will never feel the
loss. The harm done has been in the evi-
dence produced by Ministers, who, at anv
al n ge £ 6msel ™ s t 0 be State Socialists,
that when the public hands the State the
cards the ace requires just as careful watch-
ing as when I nvate Enterprise has the deal.
A PLEA FOR DEMOCRATIC
SLAVERY.
“Rimu” goes mad in a sane fashion •
The old world talks mostly in stone, and Pres-
cott observes that none of its great, endur-
ing sermons were wrought by the toil of free-
men. The gigantic strength and beauty of Baalbec
shouts even in ruin of the clear-eyed despot and the
labor-sinewed slave; while the mud hut on the
mountain, where freedom picked the cinders from
its small and evil barley-cake, has vanished like the
foam on Hengist’s beer or Ort ivnn’s m i •

Rosalind s pink-mornmg nose. A bard sings of
Freedom sitting on the heights from of old. It was
exactly where she had to sit, not from choice, but
because nobody wanted her in the vallev
emblem of freedom is forever the slab-hut nat t!
with kerosene-tins and the lean dog trying to tT
sustenance from last week’s bone. Freedom
yet saw a thing worth doing and stepped
boldly to do it. Her yell was loud in the Z !
the unpleasant smells of battle; her hyste °
scream muddled politics and ruined
States; her conspiracies corrupted religious svst
and moral codes and often cheated the hangman a
made government impossible; but Freedom n
pursued a constructive job with enthusiasm 0 r Tl
her soul into anything that really involved stead
labor. The truth is she was always so completely
tired out with her own liberty of speech that sh
bad no energy left to lift a brick or plant a treeV
do any leally useful thing. Yet the folly of placing
her on pedestals and making verses in her how
goes on, while everybody from the importer of cotton
rags and the creator of jerry-built hovels to th
hunted and haunted purveyor of beer uses her
as a shield behind which to fight progress and tK
inspector of nuisances. If Freedom has any 0 f the
good looks her worshippers insist on attributing to
her, she owes them to her habit of loafing and neg-
lecting her children and her household work to talk
over the back fence about what she would do to the
landlord if she could catch him. Such open-air occu-
pation makes for health and, consequently, f or
beauty ; but its effect on the old man’s dinner is not
satisfactory.
Australians boast of their freedom; and their
word can be taken for it that they really have all
they say. The condition in which their roads and
fences and politicians and pubs and hospitals and
cities and newspapers and garbage tins are kept may
be advanced by way of proof if anybody questions
their claim. They are free and therefore slip-
shod, and apparently incapable of tackling
a big jot) in steady earnest. In the past
kings and emperors and others built big things, such
as pyramids and magnificent temples and cities of
astounding size and splendor; but the free Aus-
tralians declare that they intend to build something
larger and more magnificent than any structure
erected in the past. They have arranged to raise
nothing less than a Commonwealth having for its
base a whole continent and reaching up to heights
that will dwarf the tallest dreams of the wildest
revolutionary democrat. Not only have they planned
this tremendous edifice, but they have already
started to construct its back premises; and, if we
were to believe some of the most enthusiastic of ib
masons, the job is far advanced and the finish quite
within sight. But an examination of the existing
portion of the structure is not likely to promote
confidence or satisfy the impartial observer.
There is a general law in architecture that a
wall should be more or less homogeneous, and that
its bricks or stones should fit one another with some
exactness. But that is not a freeman’s notion at
all. Here, for instance, is an alleged wall. It
begins with a row of bricks, but they are not laid in
a straight line like those of common walls erected by
people who do not enjoy the blessings of freedom.
One brick is laid flat and smooth; the next stands
on its end; the next leans at an angle of 45deg.
There follows a gap, temporarily filled by a sleeping
dog; and beyond this again assorted bricks stand
uneven as the lower teeth of the fretful crocodile.
Above the bricks the wall takes on a different
character. A more or less regular line of chaffbags
runs from east to west, save where at one point a
giant pumpkin has been inserted and at another
where there is a stained-glass window let in sideways.
On top of the chaffbags and the pumpkin aud the
window is a line of heavy sandstone blocks, broken
only in one place, where a cageful of singing
canaries has been provided with a niche. Above
this row is a line of glass bottles, and upon the
bottles 12 granite pillars varying from 10ft. to 60ft.
in height and supporting a lattice-work of light
timber. In some places the lattice-work gives place
to wire-netting; and at the point where the highest
pillar leans against the shortest a flagpole has been
ingeniously planted which juts out horizontally for
60ft. and then gradually curves upward to a height
of 120 yards. Half-way up the flagpole is a tea-kiosk.
Above the light lattice-work and the wire-netting
are 12 rows of alternate brick and calico; and these
are surmounted by two tiers of balconies, one of
white marble and the other of red cardboard, the
marble projection being jointed and arranged to let
down in sections by means of brass hinges and
knotted scarlet ribbon. Higher up still steam cranes
are always lifting something into position; but the
appearance of the portion of the wall already fin-
ished is sufficiently dazzling to assure it a place
among the marvels of the best architecture of free-
men.
Still, there is nothing more certain than that the
portions of the structure already erected will fall
down when the first strong wind blows. This is the
great and outstanding merit of the new style of
building. However high it may be, or however much
it may have cost, it is only necessary to remove a
canary-cage or a sleeping dog and the whole thing
subsides gently and requires to be built over again.
But, with all its obvious graces and beauties, work
of this kind will never suffice for the great design
which is to cover a continent and roof in and protect
from wind and weather the white man’s thought and
aspiration. The explanation of the dog and the
pumpkin and the chaffbags and the calico in the
wall is to be found in the freeman’s furious objec-
tion to steady work on a regular plan. These sub-
stitutes for enduring brick and stone were hurriedb
put in place while the freeborn laborers engaged in
the work were on strike to decide whether it was
worth while going to sleep or time to get up and
refuse to do any more that day. Such conditions
have made the work of national construction im-
possible; and, on the face of it, there is not the
slightest hope of a weather-proof Australia ever being
built until there is a revolution and a reformation
and a general determination to get forward on t e
part of Australians. That Australians, as freemen,
will never come to that determination seems to e
beyond all doubt. 'Their faith in calico as a building
material because it is easier to lift than brick grows
every day; and their refusal to follow the design ot
the architect or take any notice of the protests o
the clerk of works is making the position not mere i
difficult but fraught with immense danger. The one
remedy for the existing evils appears to be the re
introduction of the old healthy and wholesome slaver.'
that built Memphis and Rome and Babylon and ot er
places that were at least large and solid,
mere bandboxes compared with the thing Austra iau
profess their desire to erect.
Slavery has a lot of points to recommend it. ”
ancient Mexico the slave’s job was definite!.' set ou
in writing in the presence of four witnesses, an
slave was allowed to marry of free choice his ov
master’s daughter, if the girl would consent o
children who were born free and to own proper
even purchase other slaves. He was in a
better off than the Australian worker; and t e


-o because if he struck and refused to work he was
liable to be taken out, killed, dressed, offered as a
sacrifice to the gods and eaten. A slavery suitable
to Australia need not be based upon the Mexican
plan any more than upon the looser systems of
\thens, Rome or Virginia. The great essential is
that it should be founded on a thorough apprecia-
tion of the meaning and nature of work. An immense
amount of sheer nonsense is talked about the rights
of man. In the community of men a man has no
rights at all except in as far as he renders honest
service to that community. When a worker, having
signed an agreement to work, breaks his agreement
and goes on strike he clearly ceases to have any
rights whatever. If anybody offered him up as a
sacrifice and afterwards ate him, the act would be
one of plain decency and patriotism. A proper
democratic system of slavery would simply assert
the great principle that work must be done, and
make the loafer an outlaw whom any honest worker
could shoot at sight or capture and compel to do
anv menial task under the whip. The hunt for
loafers to clean the backyard under compulsion
would soon become keen ; and the striker would be
compelled to climb a high tree and stay there until
he was content to go back to his work. Thus the
labor troubles which are making Australia a dust-
heap of ruined dreams would pass away, and we
might be able to put up a national wall that would
no longer awaken derision in vagrant goats.
PLAIN ENGLISH.
The Curse of Cairo.
If the Australian Government wants to
give the Prime Minister a chance to do
something of really practical value while
he is in London it ought to cable him at
once to invite the British Government to
inspect the prostitutes of Egypt—of Cairo
especially—and put the vast majority, who
are diseased, into a concentration camp. The
country to which we are sending the flower
of our young men is rotten with syphilis,
and inducements with which most of them
were previously quite unfamiliar are held
out to them to contract it. An earnest
young Australian, writing the other day,
put the matter in these few vivid sen-
tences :—•
In Cairo alone there are dozens and dozens of
brothels, with signs up, in which anything up to 20
girls—mostly French —arc kept. In one part of the
town there is a whole street of them, and the wares
are displayed in the window. The mili-
tary have patrols going round the town;
but no attempt is made to close these places,
the horrible danger is of course perfectly well
known to them; indeed, they hand out a printed
slip to each newcomer warning him that practically
none of these women are free from disease. Shep-
heard’s is the fashionable hotel of Cairo. In the
grill-room the other night I counted eight generals,
the military have taken steps to prevent privates
going into this place; but the youngsters are quite
free to go into the hells. At any rate, officialdom
has so far done nothing to prevent it. This is a
British place, and it’s a disgrace that things should
he as they are.
Australia is prepared to send its best
to take their chances against the Ger-
man, the Austrian and the Turk. These
ontain cannot disarm and put into a con-
oentraticin camp. But Hughes ought to
ell the British authorities plainly that we
aie not prepared to unprotestingly send our
sons and brothers to be destroyed by an
equally horrible enemy which the British
government could put under restraint in 24
lours and would, if it had a proper sense
ot its responsibilities.
Memory and Initiative.
Holman, Premier of N. S. Wales, has a
remarkably fine memory when the occasion
suits or the wind is in the right quarter or
a lucid interval in the strenuous madness
of loan accumulation gives him time' to
think. One of his sudden bursts of recollec-
tion occurred the other night when he was
assuring the Assembly of the gentle and
altogether amiable nature of his new liquor
proposals. The Parramatta election, he
declared, had been won solely on the issue
of early closing of hotels —-and then that
sudden thunderclap of remembrance broke
over him, like the explosion of a fat patriot
who fills with sudden fury at the thought
that his three-pounds-a-week clerk is shirk-
ing his call to save an empire. He
recollected that the Labor party be-
lieved in the referendum with initiative,
and for that reason declared that those
who by beating his candidate at Parramatta
had shown their initiative would be given
an opportunity of saying on a referendum
whether the bars must close at six o’clock
or stay open to a more mellow hour. But
then his memory failed again as suddenly
as it had leaped to life. He altogether forgot
the real nature of the referendum with initia-
tive—forgot that there were a thousand
questions to which it might be applied with
as good a show of reason as to the limitation
of pub hours; forgot that provision ought to
be made for putting the initiative effectively
in the hands of the people; in fact, forgot
every blessed thing except that the alleged
principles of the Labor party might be made
some sort of excuse for the violent back-
somersault the speaker was just then throw-
ing with regard to beer-distribution. Yet
the referendum with initiative is quite a
simple matter and could have been brought
into force at any time since Holman
accepted the boss job of the State. It is of
infinitely more importance than any ques-
tion of pub-closing, because it goes right to
the political root of things, and would make
party a meaningless word, with no more
influence than the lingering flavor of an
unburied fish that died before the evacua-
tion of Gallipoli. If it is regarded as
Holman’s view that the initiative is already
in the people’s hands and that it must be
expressed by the defeat of a Government
candidate, the road is comparatively clear.
It is up to somebody to put it to the test.
At the next by-election let the whole force
of decency and honesty and .good Austra-
lianism be concentrated against the Govern-
ment candidate on the single point of State
borrowing. If the candidate is beaten —•
and he most certainly must be unless he
stands in a district peopled by progressive
lunatics — Holman, on his own established
precedent, must proceed with a referendum
on the question of borrowing or leaving it
alone. But the N.S.W. Premier will forget
until the wind is again suitable; for nothing
is more convincingly plain than that Norton
Griffiths and the referendum with initia-
tive cannot exist side by side. And without
Norton Griffiths what would the Holman
Government be?

The Fine Flower of Voluntaryism.
It can no longer be pretended that the num-
ber of recruits coming forward is adequate
to fill the reinforcement drafts and yield the
additional army of 50.000 promised by the
Commonwealth. Yet Catts, M.H.R., organ-
iser of a recruiting scheme in N. S. Wales
for the War Council, has just been assuring
everyone within reach of a daily paper that
if he could tell all he knew the whole com-
munity would rush to arms. Why, in the
name of all that is sane, doesn’t he tell it?
It may be advisable to keep silent about
some things that might help the enemy ; but
when Catts suggests that he is forced to
keep silent about something that would fill
our army and assure victory, he is quite
plainly either talking through his hat or
accusing the British leaders of treason. How-
ever, this paper does not blame Catts so
much as it pities him. He has to do the best
he can with a voluntary system which has
so utterly broken down that its leading
principles have been thrown into the gutter.
So in name we have the thing; in reality
we have discarded it. A voluntaryism which
depends upon the abuse of individuals who
do not volunteer, the shutting of them out
from employment, the introduction of pass-
ports so that they may be prevented from
leaving the country- —that sort of voluntary-
ism is better spelled Coercion. It is an
attempt to do by threats and cajolery, by
underhand, backstairs means, what we ought
to do frankly and without apology. It is as
un-Australian as it is un-British. For the
voluntary system honestly used we might
have some respect. For a voluntary system
on to which these other things have been
grafted no patriot can have anything but
contempt. llow long is our national self-
respect to be thus dragged in the muck?

Tearing Out the Slums.
According to Richard Meagher, Lord
Mayor, slums will never disappear from the
city until the Greater Sydney scheme is in
proper working. This may be so, but, see-
ing that the worst slums are in the city
proper over which Meagher reigns, it would
seem that the Greater Sydney proposal is
expected by some occult process to produce
civic administrators of greater ability than
the present Lord Mayor and his associates.
Although such a result might not seem enor-
mously difficult, it is still tolerably unlikely
while candidates come forward as the repre-
sentatives of parties and circles; but that
all reform must wait until the Heaven-sent
council with genius and initiative arrives
looks a pretty mischievous doctrine. A very
ordinary sanitary inspector with very ordi-
nary powers to condemn everything that was
unfit for the habitation of a decent white
man could rid the city of all its slums _ in
six months; but as condemnation of build-
ings is looked upon as a last resort and
only to be practised in extreme cases, the
best and surest way of abolishing slums is
to compel the owners of them to condemn
their own disgraceful possessions. When
the old Hebrew armies burst into Palestine,
certain particularly wicked cities which they
were ordered to destroy remained a per-
petual desolation —or ought to have done
so if the sons of Jacob had been faithful
to their ideals. They were not to be built
again on penalty of divine punishment, but
to stand open and wild with a steady curse
oil them' through all ages. Sydney’s slums
are as bad as Jericho or any of Canaan’s
old towns; and to forbid their re-building
once they are actually condemned would be
about the surest way of seeing that they
are immediately reformed out of existence.
Meagiier, with his Mayoralty and his Par-
liamentary pull has the chance to work the
great cleansing act even before the Greater
Sydney scheme evolves its civic adminis-
trators of capacity and conscience. To sit
down and say it can’t be done is tanta-
mount to a strenuous advocacy of the aboli-
tion of Meagher.

The Golden Rules of Trade.
“Copabella” lifts the lid again :
Bread is sold to the State institution at 6d.; the
widow, the orphan and the distressed have to pay
Bd. “Robbery!” somebody says in a furious letter
to the papers; and though it may be robbery it
isn’t necessarily robbery. Variations in price, though
often smellful, may be quite (commercially) honest.
This is how.
It is a trade axiom that all extra trade is good
trade unless it increases expenses. Few businesses
work up to the absolute limit of their staff and plant
capacity; most of them can do a little more. A
business is often overstaffed, yet cannot be run with
a hand less. The Wages Board will not permit of
cheapening the help. The trader must then either
’net less than he is justly entitled to, or increase
his turnover to catch up to his expenses. One, for
instance, is working on a 15 p.c. (on turnover)
expense, netting 5 p.c.; his outfit could handle 5 to
10 p.c. more without adding to expenses. He
therefore prospects round for more trade. Perhaps
he spends a fiver in a month’s advertising and bucks
his turnover up £3O by doing so, a net gain of £l.
The trader has not added to his working expenses and
is 20s. better off than if he had not advertised. Per-
haps he bills some remote country district (where
the “cut” quotations will not be likely to dislocate
his local shop prices), and rakes in a few trial
orders at rates that “wouldn’t pay horse-feed” for
his city business. He may make very little; but
he has kept his staff employed and has not added to
expenses; and he may have made a regular customer
at regular prices. The new trade was good trade.
“Bargain Sales” come in the same category.
Profits are sacrificed, but if working expenses are
not added to and the increased turnover makes up
for the sacrifice of profits, the sale-holder gains
both in net profits and in the advertisement. Even
if expenses are increased, so long as the turnover
increases in proportion, the trader wins. Better to
net 2 p.c. on £lOOO than 3 p.c. on £6OO.
So with the contract. If by taking a contract
the trader can extend his turnover on a profit-bearing
basis, however minute, he is the gainer. Increased
turnover means increased buying opportunities,
sounder credit, more ready money, better business.
Then, again, a contract is a guarantee of a definite
output upon which to estimate purchases, expenses,
materials, labor; it is mostly guaranteed as to cash,
facilitating credit and finance; it is generally for
large quantities, reducing working expenses of dis-
tribution, order-solicitation, book-keeping, etc.
A contract to supply an institution is a sample
of simple co-operation under Government auspices.
When the public learns to co-operate more it will
live cheaper, and there will be a lot of us robbers
out of jobs. But the public isn’t a co-operating
animal, glory be! and we can look forward .to rak-

Is a Vote to Mean Something 1 or
Something Else?
While discussing the Pub-Closing Referen-
dum Bill in its preliminary stages the N. S.
Wales Assembly spent much time, and is
apparently going to spend more, wrestling
with the question of whether a straight-out
vote for a particular hour should be consid-
ered as a vote also for some other hour. The
schedule of the Bill provides for votes being
taken in order of preference for 5,6, 7,8,
9, 10 and 11 o’clock, and various persons are
putting up the proposition that if a man
plumps for, say, 8 o’clock, instead of making
that hour his first preference and indicating
the measure of his dislike for other hours in
their order of objectionableness, his vote
shall be taken as an indication that he is
also in favor of, say, 9 o’clock and then 10
o’clock in that sequence. Others are clamor-
ing to make it obligatory on the elector to
exhaust his preferences. Holman wants to
have the plumper’s vote counted at its face
value—as a vote for 8 o’clock or 6 o’clock
or whatever it may be, and not for something
someone thinks it ought to be if there is no
majority for either 8 or 6 o’clock. Holman
is right. Parliament is not justified in giving
a voting paper any other value than the elec-
tor says he wants it to have. It is quite
conceivable that an elector may believe
that 6 o’clock is the correct hour to
turn off the beer-tap, but that if he
cannot get this hour it is desirable
for the present to give Bung a free
hand until 11. Why should Parliament say,
“Oh, this man’s vote ought to count for 7
and 8, and so on, until a majority is deter-
mined for some hour”? Of course, the man
who plumps under a preferential system is
an ass. He destroys the potential value of
his vote—casts it as a pearl among swine, so
to speak. But that is his business. The
whole business of Parliament is to make his
power clear to the voter, and then let him
give his vote such value as he desires it to
possess, limited or otherwise.
The Maoriland Government Statistician
reports that the purchasing power of the
sovereign is rapidly diminishing. What, as
an average, cost only 16s. Id. between !9vu
and 1913 cost 20s. at the end of last year.
The figures have been welcomed as though
they were a family of serpents or another
case of infantile paralysis. As a matter
of fact, the movement is one for Maoriland
and every other debtor country to give three
cheers about. Maoriland, like Australia, has
borrowed heavily and struggles with an in-
terest bill twice a year. It pays that bill
with staple products—frozen lamb, wool,
timber, gum and so on. If these things
fetch 20 per cent, more than they did a few
years ago it means that the same quantitv
of products will now pay 20 per cent, more
interest or wipe off 20 per cent, more debt.
So far as internal trade is concerned it
really doesn’t matter what the price of a
product is. In a perfectly self-contained
country you could either divide or double
all prices by two, and it wouldn’t make any
difference in the aggregate. But it would
make all the difference in the world to a
country which, having a foreign debt, must
pay toll to the bondholder. When prices
are high—that is, when you give little for
a sovereign—the obviously sensible thing to
do is to produce all you can and pay off
your debts. At the same time, since you
also then get little for a sovereign, the
equally sensible thing to do is to both buy
and borrow as little as possible. But
instead of accepting high prices as a sign-
post to a policy of this sort, Maoriland and
Australia alike are disposed to regard them
merely good reason for asking for
higher w r ages.
There was regulation of prices in Mel-
bourne, regulation of prices in Sydney, and
now there is more regulation of prices all
over the place; and on what principle it has
been worked no one has yet explained, be-
cause no one knows. Meantime the wild
farce of the State Government fixing one
price and the Federal Government coming
along with another price for the same goods
in the same territory is a beautiful commen-
tary on our muddled system of Government.
Last harvest the Ma State grabbed the
wheat and defied the Commonwealth and
fixed prices. This time the Commonwealth
grabs the price-fixing apparatus and defies
Ma. Next time they ought to make a dead
heat of it and defy one another as further
proof that we get good value for the money
spent in maintaining 14 Houses of Parlia-
ment.
The question that will arouse the greatest
attention at the coming P.L.L. conference
in Sydney will be the cost of living in rela-
tion to current wages. Labor generally feels
that it is in the exhausted condition of a
dog that has been furiously chasing its tail
with comparatively trifling results. The
position is not that the worker has derived
no benefit from arbitration, for the standard
of living has undoubtedly advanced tremen-
dously during the last decade; but he has
been distressed to find that no sooner has
his pay gone up than the cost of living has
gone up too. The P.L.L. Conference is going
to try to find out a method by which the pay
of labor may increase while the cost of the
things produced by labor may remain where
it was. This paper is sorry to think that
the P.L.L. Conference is booked for a dis-
appointment. Yet there is a way of benefit-
ing the worker, and that is by making the
loafer work. At present about half of the
product of this country’s labor is consumed
by the spongers, and things are not going
to permanently improve for the worker till
this great cohort of parasites is driven to
get work too. And the worst parasites of
all are the speculators in land who are made
fat by the increment in values created by
borrowing booms. To monkey with prices
is merely to play with the pimples on the
body. To do any good the reformer must
get at the ill that lies underneath.
“Franklin” : All the prisons are not under
Government control. Because I was brought
up to stick to my job and take what was
given me, I find myself a clerk inhabiting
for 40 hours a week a dog-hole of an office
which contains only 504 feet of cubic air
space, whereas the smallest room a suburban
council will allow in a dwelling-house must
have at least 1000 feet. The only current
of air I get is the hurricane that comes out
of the boss’s mouth whenever I happen to
be late; lacking that, I swelter and grow
drowsy in an airless hole next to the gener-
ally unoccupied but always very well venti-
lated apartment where the chief does his
growling. I have calculated that it contains
2352 cubic feet of air space, and I would fall
down and fondle his boots if he would only
cut off that odd 52 feet and give them to me.
City office accommodation everywhere seems
to range from the gorgeously hygienic pal-
aces of the best insurance cos. to the con-
sumption-breeding, rat-haunted dens pro-
vided by the little parasites who scuffle for
a living in old buildings. The old buildings
always seem to be the property of a rich
absentee or some inaccessible person or
myth who never dreamt of letting in a little
more light and air and bringing the dingy
old rent-producer up to date. I’m going to
breathe in Egypt presently, so it won’t mat-
ter to me. But I’d like to get a few more
cubic feet for the poor fowl who takes on
my old job in this hencoop. If it wasn’t
that I’m afraid of disturbing their beautiful
dreams, I’d suggest to the town-planners to
come down out of the clouds and nose around
among these small offices for a while.
“Murkah”: When are Australian tramway
Commissioners going to see that the present
so-called “life-saver” is a delusion? In
almost every case the victim of an accident
has to be scraped from under the tram. The
function of a life-saver is, I take it, to pre-
vent the possibility of a person getting
there. The scheme of protection at present
in use on Sydney’s Juggernauts is useless.
In a manner of speaking, it subpoenas its
own jury, one at a time, and is convicted by
them, one after another, of hopeless ineffici-
ency. Nine times in 10 the result of a
Sydney tram accident is a funeral. What is
wanted is a strong steel mesh, placed in
front of the car about 4ft. high and project-
ing out in front about 3ft. on small wheels
or runners. This is the U.S. practice, and
it works well. The horizontal part runs
along a couple of inches clear of the ground,
and the slightest pressure brings it down.
A person run into is flung down on to it
and carried along. Of course, there are in-
juries—a person taken amidships by 20
tons or so of flying ironmongery is bound to
have some skin knocked off —but this is a
trifling inconvenience compared with the
ghastly butcheries Sydney witnesses every
week or so. Once in San Francisco I wit-
nessed a discussion between a tram and a
large, stately lady. Down she walloped on
to the life-saver, and was carried yards
before the tram stopped. She got up and
walked off. Had the accident happened in
Sydney the morgue would have been the
address of the l.s. lady.
France.
You with the red blood-flame about your
heart,
Who set your proud lips to the trumpet
peal,
And with that shuddering music tore apart
The death-mist of a universal fear;
You, who were first to dare as first to feel
The mightier task of man, and like a sea,
Roaring a surf of blood through ruin sheer,
Swept the broad shore and stood alone and
free!
You, whose tremendous purpose, edged with
fire,
Flinched never from destroying lightnings
hurled,
But always towards your white heights of
desire
Strode like the pure hope of a breaking
morn,
An undimmed glory through the living
world —•
To you we bend our homage and advance
The deathless claim of our great love re-born
To stand or fall beside immortal France!
Old jealousies are dead, old hopes remain.
The splendid light of your unfearing eyes
In the loud front of danger calls again
Like resonant drum music on the wind.
Our mingled armies in their strength arise,
Our mingled dead on one red altar lie ;
And you—oh, shame that once our eyes were
blind —•
We hail the greatest nation ’neath God’s
sky.
We with the truth had paltered, overborne
By noise of boasting and the foolish sound
Of our own chariot wheels in deep ruts worn
Through the forgotten ages. Now we know,
For these red days, in heedless slaughter
drowned.
Within our hearts have set the lesson deep,
How much in all to your clear sight we owe
Who held through tears the faith we would
not keep.
Ours shall be triumph e’er the songs of
peace
Come floating up the valleys of our strife.
Never the rain of cleansing fire shall cease
Till wrong in bitter smoke has passed away.
Hand clasped in hand, through death to
grander life,
Absolved of that disunion that were sin,
We march to face the glory of that day
When Man, blood ransomed, at the last shall
win.

The Insulting Conduct of the Portugee
towards Kultur.
After three weeks the German is still pound-
ing away at the French lines around \ erdun
without making any more progress than had
been made by the Allies in attacks upon his
burrows further north, and he was still not
convinced that the assault was without hope.
On the surface of things it seems astounding
that the Allies are not taking advantage of
the German concentration before Verdun to
deliver a punch somewhere else. And
assuredly it would be astounding if
this war was like any other war.
But it isn’t. Judging by the Hun’s
experiences west of Warsaw, and the
Russian investigations on the Carpa-
thians, and the ghastly lessons the
Marne, in the Champagne, at Loos, Neuve
Chapelle, Ypres and lately at Verdun, an
attack upon modern entrenchments is
merely another way of inviting tenders for
the accumulation of corpses on the side of
the attackers. It would be a grim lookout
for the Allies if they had to blast a way
through the German trenches, but it may
not be necessary to do that. To win the Ger-
man must burst the wall of steel that encom-
passes him. Even to save himself from defeat
he must do it—and at the right place. But
to lick him it would appear to be sufficient
for the Allies to heave him back to where he
was before, since, though it is the wildest
sort of nonsense to consider the German at
the end of his tether, he is tied up in an
awkward place, and the longer he is there
the less he will like it. If the war boils down
to this, as it quite likely may, becoming a
sort of siege, with the Allies directing their
efforts to pinning the German to his eastern
and western fronts, and getting a stranglehold
on the Turk and Bulgur, the end of the dis-
turbance will begin to look a long way fur-
ther off than it did when the business of
flinging the Ilun back to the Rhine appeared
a workable proposition capable of being car-
ried through within a moderate time. If
entrenched positions cannot be carried by
such a gigantic thrust as the German aimed
at Verdun, the armies that do not .have to
make such an attempt are not likely to try
it on unless the defence has grown very
weak. Meanwhile the Ilun heard something
the other day that will make him more
anxious than ever to leap outwards and get
someone by the neck as a warning to the uni-
verse. This had relation to the seizure by
Portugal of the numerous German vessels
interned in Portuguese ports. Ships are now
as valuable as gold-mines, and anyone who
can acquire a fleet of mercantile carriers for
nothing gets possession of machinery for
acquiring cash by the ton. All those vessels
lying idle in sight of the Portugee were a
great temptation—-which he mastered by
annexing the lot, thereby setting all
other countries' to which German ships
are tied an example in enterprise. And
the more vessels the German submarine sends
to the bottom the greater will be the incentive
to follow the lead of Portugal. There-
fore the horrid apprehension that all his ships
are going to be collared may cause the Hun to
ask old Von Tirpitz what ter tevil his
blessed navy is for, and the old man may
rush the fleet out to sea, and the Grown
Prince may keep on launching his ai’mies
against the Allies’ dugouts in frantic
anxiety to get within striking distance of
everyone having an interned German ship
on hand, and the machine guns and bayonets
may give them beans, and the war may be
brought to a conclusion by one great decisive
battle lasting 175 weeks, at the end of which
the earth will have been blown into frag-
ments—all tne resuit of intervention by Por-
tugal. Anyhow, this is just as likely to
happen as anything else, the only more un-
likelv thing being that the German fleet
will remain in hiding for ever. That outfit
is going to take a hand in the game for
certain.
Prime Minister Hughes devoted a good
deal of his first big speech in London to the
metal business, and cursed the Germans for
getting hold of it. Cursing Germans is easy
and popular; but what about going on a dew
line and cursing somebody else for allowing
the Germans to get hold? The metals
were, so far as we are concerned, in Aus-
tralia ; and England and Wales sup-
plied large quantities of the coal with which
the ores were smelted in Europe. So we
voluntarily handed the business over to these
people. Honestly, in these circumstances,
who earned the curses? The Huns, who
took off their coats and worked, or the
Hugheses and other Freetraders, who
always preferred “trade” to toil? We are
only going to fall into the pit in the future
if we refuse to recognise where we went
astray in the past.

Harry Gullett, who was Australia's official
war correspondent in Flanders for more than
the first year of the war, and also had a look-
in at the Dardanelles, is no lecturer in the
ordinary way of the business. At his first
address at the Town Hall (Sydney) on Satur-
day night he displayed none of the tricks
of the journeyman—and was all the better
for it. He said his unrehearsed piece as one
tells a yarn at the camp-fire or between
sodas in the smoke-room. Which was pre-
cisely how the encouraging audience would
have chosen to hear about the wonders and
horrors of the Western hell. There was
nothing very new in Gullett’s yarn, but there
was more of the little things that count than
the cold pen has dug out, except here and
there in letters of the simple soldier. For
instance, where has one been given so swift
a view of what this Avar of human moles,
burrowing underground, means as from these
words? “I have looked through periscopes
and over fire parapets thousands of times
and have seen nothing. That is the experi-
ence of soldiers, too. They may be in the
trenches for six months, be killed or sent
home wounded, and never have set eyes on
a living enemy.” Gullett, judging the Aus-
tralian soldiers by what lie saw of them
in Gallipoli, reckons them to be the best
warriors in the world to shake a bayonet at.
In physique and intelligence he knows noth-
ing wearing uniform in Europe to equal his
countrymen. But the keen pressman does
not stint admiration for the Frenchman and
Tommy Atkins (the regular, not the re-
cruity) as first-class fighting men. When
he speaks of the terrible valor unto annihila-
tion that the British regulars showed in
closing up the allied line near Ypres he
takes off his hat. The correspondent has no
comfort for the bird of peace. He is confi-
dent that the end of the carnage is a long
way off. dim and unseeable. “How long?”
you ask. “This year—yes; next year—
maybe. I don’t know. But we’ll win,” he
concludes ; “we’ve got to win.”
How many Michaels are there in Sydney?
The Bulletin doesn’t know, but it pro-
poses to take a dozen tally-clerks along to
the Palace on Saturday, when a series of
cinema pictures of Pope Pius X. and his
work-a-day life in the Vatican will be
screened for the first time. All the Micks
won’t be in the theatre, because, as the
accommodation is limited, some of them will
be killed in the rush and one or two are
accidentally in gaol. But the scathless and
the wounded will make a great show,
begorra.
* ❖ *
Sydney Majesty’s still shelters “So Long,
Letty,” and the season is now 12 weeks old.
If the management would prune the dialogue
and bud a few more dances and songs on to
the old stock it would be a better show, and
the patron who wants to hear the ragtime
once more would not be scared off by the
drivelsome libretto.
So far, there is no sign of any shortage of
high-explosives for “Under Fire” at Sydney
Criterion, though occasionally the smoke
from the bomb-explosion is too much for the
audience in rhe front reserved trenches, and
the Firm should consider the question of pro-
viding gas-masks.
The rumors of a change of programme at
Sydney’s Little Theatre, where the Blue-
Thought play, “The Victory,” has been per-
sisting, had not materialised when this paper
had to go to press. The suspense is terrible.
The movies are booming in Sydney. At
the Royal, which the J.C.W. people handed
•over to the silent actor, the Fox films con-
tinue to draw big houses. The old Lyceum
—also a “legitimate” theatre 10 years or so
ago—has been remodelled by W. Barrington
Miller, and will in future be known as the
Triangle Playhouse, the Sydney home of the
Triangle Film Co.’s productions. “The
Coward,” a six-act drama, and “Crooked to
the End,” a two-act comedy, are the features
for the opening of the theatre on Saturday.
Barrington Miller has also secured the Town
Hall for a week from March 2b for “Britain
Prepared,” and he stakes his Barrington that
these are the best series of war pictures yet
produced.
“The Land o’ th’ Shamrock,” the drama-
tisation of Samuel Lover’s “Rory O More,
was produced by Gerald E. Griffin at Sydney
Adelphi on Wednesday; hut as the Marlow
revue, “You’re the One,” commences on
Saturday, “Rory” will not survive St. Pat’s
Lay. , .
The White City (Sydney) is preparing
trouble for a committee of,local artists. It
offers £5O for the photograph of the most
beautiful girl available, and the committee
is to do the judging. However, it doesn’t
matter. There are too many artists, anyhow.

The Green Dandies are blossoming under
summer skies at the l Garden Theatre (Syd-
ney). In case any stranger has arrived
since last The Bulletin mentioned the
matter, the Garden Theatre lies just over
the shoulder of William-street. Tram fare,
one penny, except on Sundays, when it is
tuppence, in order to make up for the loss
of revenue by reason of the show being
closed.
Sydney Tivoli is marking time heavily
these evenings. Barton (of Barton and Ash-
ley) raises numerous laughs with an old yet
still-welcome sketch ; but the rest of the com-
pany are only faintly interesting. De Coe,
of the tables and chairs, climbs through his
turn like the man who comes to mend the
gas; and Mildred Grover, of whom the mana-
gerial advt. speaks glowingly, isn’t as
entertaining as her accompanist. Musette,
the dancing lady-fiddler, is well enough, and
would be better if she knew when to stop.
The bill needs speeding up.

“The Belle of New York,” now doing a
fortnight’s revival at Melbourne Majesty’s,
is a reminder that an invariable strain of
sentiment runs through all Yankee comedies
which deal with wealthy fathers and their
dollars. Even as the pompous boss of the
drapery store in “Within the Law” waits
fondly upon the indiscretions of his son and
heir, so doth the King of Soap (“It Pays to
Advertise”) confine his only apparent inter-
ests in life to the job of making his own dear
boy a prudent, dollar-loving member of the
Soap Trust. Long before either of these
parents was born into the dramatic world
Ichabod Bronson had gammoned to cast off
his spendthrift Ilarry, in order that the
superlative young idiot might be converted
to a true knowledge of industry and become
fit to carry on the paternal glue factory at
Cohoes. The popular American ideal mil-
lionaire, seemingly, is a man who in the first
place encourages his only son to be a waster,
and then glories in his commercial salvation
through the grace of some gyurl.
The difference between Ichabod and the
subsequent millionaires is that he combines
the fatuousness of a father with the eccen-
tricity of a nightmare. Bronson senior is a
sweet ohl fraud as a Moral Endeavorer. a
gay old joke and a grand old institution.
No other aged parent in comic opera is like
unto Ichabod. He remains a stranger in a

conventional character who are weirdly con-

“Twelfth Night” is scoring the hit of the

Melbourne, and Marlow’s experiment with
Shakspeare at popular prices promises to
put money in his purse. “As You Like It”

Excellencies-i 11-Chief will come along to give

At Melbourne King’s the weird adventures
of The A aybaeks are a weakening attraction
since the truth about that loose-made enter-
tainment became known. Some of the epi-
sodes considered singly are good specimens
of Australian comedy, but collectively they
don't amount to an interesting play. The
audience takes none of the Waybacks, except
the old man, to its heart, and Dad himself
is not a matter for reasonable enthusiasm.
The others are outside the pale of human
sympathy, as far as townspeople are con-
cerned.

A feature of the twice-daily bill at Mel-
bourne Bijou this week is Victor the Great.
\ ietor is adding to the illusions of our mortal
life, and has brought a company of deceivers
to assist him. Rosa Ivy Lee sings of Venice
with moving illustrations, and the Glockers
juggle dexterously with vessels full of
water. Their turn has no connection with
Early and Laight’s sketch entitled “On the
Water Waggon,” which is a moralless ser-
mon on intemperance. La France Brothers
are head balancers of some distinction, and
Hazel Morris and others sing or otherwise.
To-night (Thursday) is the fifth and last
of Fredk. Coleman at the Auditorium in
Melbourne. As a war lecturer the burly
American is nearly all that Ashmead Bartlett
wasn’t, apart from the fact that he deals
with the onslaught of the Huns on the
Western Front in the early days of their
cocksureness, and concludes at the battle of
Neuve Chapelle. Ashmead Bartlett had little
to say about other individuals and practi-
cally nothing to say about himself, whereas
Coleman speaks much about some people and
frequently alludes to Number One. His
lecture is personal, anecdotal and fairly
picturesque. Two or three hundred photo-
graphs help to give a good idea of the Fronts
where Coleman and his motor-car played
their little parts in the awful performance
which is still going on.

From an Adelaide critic:—
Christie Wright, the new director of the School of
Art, has brought with him from Sydney a collection
of dashing things in color intended largely for the
decoration of schools. The style varies from Dulac to
Kate Greenaway, with incursions into sheer panto-
mime scene-painting—this latter comparison strength-
ened by the fact that nursery legends form the
usual subject. Also, there are friezes, “conventional ’
and very unconventional, and skilful things in em-
broidery, of which art Adelaide knows a good deal
already. As the work of teachers who are not regular
art-school students the little show is brilliant in
parts.

“Mother Goose,” at Adelaide Royal, will
e 0 down to history as the only pantomime
on record in which the Dame threatened
nersonal violence to the Good Fairy; never
before has that glittering but preachy abstrac-
tion found anyone to give her back-talk. The
show is still as it was in Melbourne—strong-
est in acrobatics and mechanical effects
(though the gale that blows the village away
has somehow failed to reach Adelaide), weak-
est in witty dialogue and catchy songs. It
is doing large business. So is the Willard-
iohnson fight film at the Tivoli, to which,
the management boasts, one might take a
parson’s daughter without offence. Quite

Airlie is quietly effective at the piano, and
the Nelsons do clever tilings on stilts. Won-
dergraph’s most striking picture is tbe local
manufacture of war-shells, and West’s have
some films made in England. Tbe weather
is getting chill for open-air evening shows,
but the Ideals and the Dandies do not worry ;
neither do their many steady patrons.
“John”: Right in the middle of his in-
quiries into the chauffeur-shooting case at
Heidelberg, Macmanamny, superintendent
of the Vic. Criminal Investigation Branch,
was taken off the job and sent to tbe charge
of a country district, while Superintendent
Davidson was brought down from Benalla
and given the city billet. Certainly,- David-
son had been an inspector in Melbourne;
but as a detective, steeped in knowledge of
criminal records and having a comprehen-
sive acquaintance with the fizgig, Macman-
amny was probably the most useful sleuth
visible above the surface at the moment.
But it seems “Superintendent Macman-
amny’s health is very unsatisfactory owing
to stress of work.” Yet he was well enough
on the day his transfer was reported and his
ill-health advertised to accompany the Chief
Commissioner to the “scene of the crime”
at Heidelberg and continue in charge of the
case as head of the C.I. Branch. 11 is
transfer at such a stage, through overwork
—though Sainsbury has openly expressed his
belief that the Victorian force is fully
manned for any emergency—makes the
Chief Commissioner look as though he had
chilblains on his bump of discretion.
“Melbournian”: Unionism went mighty
close to suspending the publication of tbe
Age last week. When the Storemen and
Packers’ Union struck against the public
tree stores, the Age was caught with the
bulk of its supply of paper in Tracey’s
establishment at South Melbourne. Tracey
would not agree to the union terms, and an
embargo was laid on the removal of any
goods from his stores. As the little stock
that was available to the Age elsewhere
grew beautifully less, the fears of the S.vmes
magnificently increased. At length so
threatening was the situation that the Typo.
Society and the Printing Trades Operatives
Lnion were induced to intervene. They
pleaded with the storemen and the disputes
committee of the Trades Hall in turn. But
the typos, hadn’t the slightest influence with
the storemen or the disputes committee, who
would, remembering past scourgings, gladly
have shut up the Age for a time. With
small-sized napers and borrowings from the
Argus the Age was able to come out each

AT POVERTY POINT.
Kaniva : Ned Farley, the basso, died in
Sydney last week. Ned was an idol in
operatic productions in Australia for at
least 30 years. His first appearance was
with Lyster's Italian co. at the Theatre
Royal (Melb.) in 1870 in Petrelli’s “lone”
(“Ihe last days of Pompeii”), when his
voice attracted much attention. “The Grand
Duchess” was produced in Feb., 1871. Fanny
Si monsen, Georgia Hodson, Beaumont and
barley were the principals. Farley’s Gen-
eial Boom was a great performance and is
quoted to the present day, and his Caspar
Freischutz”) and Mourzook
( Girofie-Girona”) were never equalled in
these parts. He was an earnest and con-
scientious “study” for all he essayed. About
his last appearance in comic opera- was as
Dick Deadeye in “Pinafore” (Melb., 1895),
when Florence Young was the Josephine.’
He made Sydney his home in 1895, and
boiled the pot with pupils.
Thomas Knight Aston, a member of Dun-
ning and Wallace’s Comic Opera Co. which
opened in Melbourne in Sept., 18S2, died at
I itzroy a few days ago. The other mem-
bers of that famous troupe were Kate
Chard, Agnes Mitchell, Annette Ivanova,
Agnes Consuelo, Loredon, T. B. Appleby
and Deane Brand. Yon Suppe’s “Boccac-
cio” was the first production. It had a
run of 10 weeks. “The King's Dragoons”
followed, and with “Manola” and “Barbe
Bleue” a five months’ season was success-
fully conducted. The last 10 years of the
late tenor’s life were a purgatory of intense
suffering.

George Willoughby is busy making films
in Australia, his list so far including “The
Woman in the Case,” “A Fool There Was,”
“The Love that Saved” (one of Bedford’s),
“A Pearl of Great Price” (which sounds
like another of Randolph’s), “Raffled,”
“South Sea Romances” (some of them by one
of The Bulletin’s abo.-writers, “Lagani
Namo”), and “The Jeanne d’Arc of Loos.”
This last depicts the great charge of the
British and French, alleged to have been
led by one Emilienne Moreau, which drove
the swashbucklers out of Loos. In the cast
are Jane King (playing the name part),
Jean Robertson, Beatrice Esmond, Arthur
Greenaway, Austin Milroy, Clive Farnham
and Harry Halley. Over 300 people will be
engaged to produce the piece.
The Liedertafel—formed in 1005 by the
union of Melbourne’s two rival concerns in
the same line of entertainment—has gone to
the Front to such an extent that its rem-
nants can hardly be heard across the street.
The other day secretary Whitehead adver-
tised for 11 basses and 11 tenors, an un-
equalled record of requirements which shows
what the society has been doing. Beyond
its title the Liedertafel has nothing Hunnish
about it, the names on its committee-list
being purely Anglo-Australian and quite
above reproach—from that standpoint at
least.
The old Adelaide house known for half a
century by various names, from White’s
Rooms to Star Picture Theatre, is now repre-
sented by a gap in the King William-street
frontage, with the bar of the Clarence Hotel
trying to carry on business-as-usual among
the ruins. However, bricks are being
poured into the gap, and a Majestic Theatre
is to arise, with a new hotel. The Fuller
Co. has joined hands with Sayers and Len-
non, who will act locally as managing direc-
tors for a Majestic Amusements Co., otntr
directors being Fuller and Rofe and
McEwan in Sydney. The Brennan-Fuller
circuit will move from the King’s into the
Majestic when it is ready (which is to be
early in June), giving vaudeville, with two
shows a day—a new idea for Adelaide. The
construction of the new house, which has
possibly the best site in Adelaide, is run by
Williams and Good, the architects who put
up the fine new Tivoli in Grobe-street. It
is (of course) to represent the latest and
best in all points of theatre-arranging, in-
cluding the promised luxury of tip-up seats
even in the gallery. Capacity, about 1200.
“0.K.”: Theatrical advt. writers have
captured a new term for the shows they
boost. They have lassoed “pulsating.”
Everything pulsates now. The melodrama
pulsates with emotion and pathos. A Yan-
kee comedy pulsates with the joy of life.
An opera thrills with the pulsations of
passion. Even the poor old annual panto,
has a pulse that can be felt. Similar enter-
tainments used to suffer from “throbbing”
merely, but the heart throb of yesteryear is
the “soul pulsation” of to-day. Pretty soon
the stage stories will begin to “shiver ecsta-
tically ’ or “tremble with suggestion,” and
then the descriptive writer will probably
return to his ancient vomits and stodgy
superlatives.
“C. Ockney” : Dot Boueieault produced at
his London theatre on February 8 a new
comedy by Somerset Maugham, whose “Lady
Frederick” was exploited here by Ethel
living. The piece is called “Caroline,” and
the principal performers are" all known
to Australians —Irene Vanbrugh, Lillah
McCarthy and “Dot” himself.
"The Sub-editor’s Butler”: I venture to
predict that the present picture boom at the
Firm’s Sydney Royal won’t last. The Firm
doesn’t give good enough value. The Fox
productions, with the exception of “Car-
are, so far, no improvement upon
the Nordisk and Cines productions. In
"Carmen” the local color made the show.
It was artistic and convincing. In “Ivreut-
zer Sonata” the scene is laid in Russia, and
obviously made in America. There is not
even a drosky in it. And the picture-fiend
requires exteriors —not studio scenes with
stage props. There is. too, the terrible
drawback of the audience having first to
sit out a whole hour of the ordinary Ameri-
can comic or wild-west abortion. In the
continuous shows the connoisseur notes the
time of the big feature and drops in solely
for it. But the popularity of the Royal is
such that in order to get a seat you must be
there before eight. The Royal was not
built for pictures. In all modern cinema
houses every seat gives the audience a full
view of the screen. In the Royal, a seat
at the side of the circle gives it a stiff neck.
And the view of the circle patrons is plenti-
fully obstructed by superfluous pillars.
The Lyceum was bad too, but has decided to
reform. Finally, the Firm has missed a
great chance in the alleged decoration of the
proscenium. Evidently the artistic talent
at command did not reach higher than
the ideal of an ice-cream emporium.
The cheap decoration of paper wis-
taria and the soda-counter fountains are
artistically shocking. There was a chance*
of dignified simplicity and a color appeal
that can be found in some of the newer pic-
ture-houses, but it was thrown away.
“C. Ockney”: Charles ILawtrey and Sey-
mour Hicks are asking their creditors, per
medium of the bankruptcy court, what is
the least they can do with. Nothing less
than £l5O has been the pair’s weekly wage for
years, and yet they find themselves stone,
motherless broke. Hawtrey owes £20,000,
but a little thing like that hasn’t disturbed
the sang-froid that has made him famous.
He cheerfully informed the Official Receiver
that his assets might realise £lO. His
last* bankruptcy was in 1804. The lia-
bilities then amounted to £27,332, but his
assets on that occasion were as much as
£4O. His present annoying position lie at-
tributes to a run of unsuccessful plays —
and, of course, the war.
“ J.F.H.”: Madge Titheradge is billed to
lead in “The Tiger’s Cub” at the Garrick
here in London. It is described as a
romance of Alaska in three acts —an up-to-
date Bret Harte yarn of a primeval mining
camp in the Arctic regions, with plenty of
revolver practice and all sorts of other wild
and wet activities. Madge’s pa is _ a most
unprincipled villain, whose ferocity has
earned for him the name of “The Tiger”;
so Madge is the cub of the title.
From London : Genevieve Ward, aged 70,
had a great reception on reappearing at the
St. James’s in “The Basker.” The new play
did not pan out altogether satisfactorily, but
veteran Genevieve scored an emphatic indi-
vidual success as a vigorous, exuberant
Duchess prone to plain talk and colored
language. At the final fall of the curtain
manager Sir George Alexander and Gene-
vieve came out hand-in-hand, and Alexander
paid a graceful tribute to the grand old lady’s
talent and her long and distinguished career.
She is permanently commemorated in Aus-
tralia by the Genevieve Ward wing of the
Melbourne Women’s Hospital.
Tbe G.-G.’s wife and Lowther Clarke,
Anglican Archbishop of Melbourne, with
Martin Hannah and Frank Tudor, who re-
present ('ollingwood Fiat in their respective
Parliaments, have been lending their aid to
the abolition of sweating. At the laying of
a memorial-stone for £lO,OOO worth of church
overlooking the Flat, it was stated that the
holy house would be entirely built by union
labor. Which may be taken as an admission
that the Church recognises that grinding
poverty is an enemy of godliness and that
there is no better cure for it in sight than
unionism.
“H.” : In view of a probable recurrence of
meningitis during the winter, a polite letter
was sent by the Board of Health in Victoria
to the municipalities throughout the State,
asking them to join in a scheme for adding
to the accommodation at the Infectious Dis-
eases Hospital. Replies were received by the
Beard from 75 per cent, of the bodies. The
other 25 per cent, apparently intend to ignore
the Board's request altogether. That such
a state of affairs should be possible in regard
to so serious a business says a lot for
Peacockism as an over-ripe brand of admin-
istration and a fit subject for early burial.
The correct thing for the Government to do
is to pass another little health measure, build
the required hospital additions and draw on
the defaulting municipalities for their share
of the expense. But that sort of bold, clean,
sanitary proposal doesn’t appeal to the kind
of politician of which the Peacock Cabinet is
mostly composed. It might turn a vote
against them somewhere.
“Bill O’C.”: Is there no specific for the
treatment of these misguiders in the daily
press? Most of our military specialists
have long since been reduced to demonstrat-
ing their strategy on coffee-tables, but the
sanguine leader-writer still bobs up fresh and
unafraid. Picking up an Adelaide Adver-
tiser of March 7 I read an article on “The
German Reverse.” which opened thus: “Now
that it is possible to speak of the Verdun
operations in the past tense. .. .” Two davs
later (Thursday, March 0) the past tense
spoke in a vigorous present in the same
paper in a cable headed: “Verdun Battle: A
German Advance,” which announced that
the Germans had increased the fury of their
onslaught, capturing Fresnes, Forges and
Regneville and crossing the Meuse to the
north-west of Verdun. The whole bloody
business may end in a German reverse—let
us hope so—but to talk of it blandly in the
middle of the fight, while the enemy is (terri-
torially, at least) a bit to the good, on the
strength of a few sanguine cables from our
own side, is folly, most laughable if it were
not so dangerous. It is one thing to be san-
guine, like the .French, fighting tooth and
nail, with every man and every ounce of
energy, where confidence is a call to supreme
energy, and quite another thing to sit back
at a comfortable distance dictating to a typ-
ist confident reassurances that all is well
and the French can be trusted to take care
of things. Prejudice recruiting? The police
every now and then run in some intoxicated
Teuton for having said that “Der Bridish
can’t vin.”_ Is he any worse than the hypno-
tising patriot who says “We can’t lose”?
At Lismore, which lies in the Western
District between Skipton and Camperdown.
Rodgers, M.H.R., recently unfolded his
scheme in connection with the repatriation
of returned soldiers, and gifts in money and
kind were promised in large bunches to assist
the enterprise. The Curries gave £lBOO and
1-0 acres of wheat between them ; and the
Ornans offered 200 acres of wheat and £2OO
cash, besides the promise of David Oman
AI.L. A., previously recorded, of all the wheat
he takes off his acres next season. They can
afford it; but it looks handsome alongside
some Western District contributions.
THE JUVENILE LEAD.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
Ssmith is a leading juvenile,
A man who does heroic deeds,
hile fortune smiles its fickle smile
And in the limelight virtue bleeds.
Black-hearted villainy succeeds,
Until, within the final act,
The truth becomes a patent fact!

The way Ssmith glitters in his part
Adore him, and, in dreams most bright,
Hope someone like this man of art
Will offer them his throbbing heart.
The limelight shows that juvenile
Brave, young and strong and free from guile
To Jones the shirker’s an offence;
So when one night he sought the bar

He snorted with some anger: “Yar !

lie rather punched the final word,
And it was plain the actor heard.
Ssmith held the centre of the stage
\\ ith folded arms, he looked at Jones,
His eyes ablaze with honest rage.
then, speaking in high, noble tones,
As one who villainy dethrones,
He slew Jones with one sentence blunt:
“My grandson, sir, is at the. Front!”

Only one large “passenger” was turned
out on the Clyde last year. This was the
Union Co.’s twin-screw, geared-turbine flier
Aotearoa. She is a 15,000-ton oil-burner,
full sister to the Niagara, and is intended
for the Sydney-Auckland-Vancouver run. All
other vessels of her class have been delayed
in construction owing to the war, but she
was allowed to be rushed along to comple-
tion because, on account of her size and
speed, John Bull wanted her. When she
was ready the Union Co. was advised that
it could have her after the war, and then the
Admiralty sooled her out to sea on a special
job in parts unknown.
* * * *
The South Aus. Government has obtained
a report from the new women “patrols”—
they don’t care to be called police —-which
bears out what The Bulletin has often said
about the comparative lilywhiteness of the
behavior of young couples in public parks and
on the beach. “No thought of being inde-
cent,” says the chief patrol. “In hundreds
of cases no doubt without a wicked thought
or action,” says a male police inspector.
Wowsers and comic singers can share the
blame for spreading the idea that courting in
a public place means improper conduct.
“Spooning” is a natural infirmity, and a
democratic country should not be the one to
condemn every girl whose pa can’t afford a
drawing-room or a conservatory to practise
in. On the other hand, both John and Jane
Hop report and regret that “during the last
few years it has become the fashion to do
the courting lying down,” which is bad for
the weaker characters, and in any case makes
passers-by think things. “Not indecent, but
immodest,” is the joint verdict; and modesty
has to be taught at home—not by the police.
THAT'LL BE ALL!
LOTHARIO EADENGLIGHT :“What's my ideah of perfect bliss, dealt boy? Well, to he in a
hammock smoking a fine cigar given me by an admirer, while a divine woman who
worships me fans me as she reads aloud complimentary notices of my incomparable
acting.”
“J.G.” The day before yesterday a mob
of cockies and our only Jaypee foregathered
at one of the local pubs. Everybody got
drunk but the Jaypee—who got very drunk.
Presently the zealous local Hop stormed in
and arrested the nearest of the noisy crowd.
While the pair were two-stepping to the
lock-up the partly-sobered assembly broke
up in haste and carried the speechless Jay-
pee to a place of safety. Yesterday, at the
urgent request of the accursed policeman,
the aching representative of the Law took
his seat on the bench to judge his fellow-
reveller. A weaker man would have seen
justice done; but the Jaypee was strong and
loyal-—he said he didn’t think the prisoner
was drunk, and discharged him without a
stain on his liver.
“H. 0.” : Winston Churchill has poked him-
self into the public eye again by demanding
that Fisher —the man he had the row with
over the Dardanelles operations—shall be
recalled to the Admiralty. John is the man
for the job, Churchill recognises, in spite of
his personal prejudice. The fleet as it exists
to-day is, at any rate, largely Fisher’s crea-
tion ; and it is what it is simply because he
was ready to listen always to new ideas—
which itself is a new idea among the Admi-
ralty barnacles. It was Fisher who was
chiefly responsible for the scrapping in one
swoop of 162 out-of-date warships—an action
for which he has not yet been forgiven by
some Liberals. It was he who was respon-
sible for the adoption of the water-tube boiler
(which enables a boat to get up steam in 20
minutes instead of anything up to eight
hours) ; for the Parsons turbine (which he is
said to have come across in a penny ferry) ;
foi the introduction of oil fuel to the navy ;
and the creation of the Dreadnought, which
for years made the Kiel Canal about as use-
ful for practical purposes as the Cotter
trickle. Since the war Fisher has en-
hanced his reputation in quarters not
swayed by party politics. The concentration
ot the navy in the North Sea was a simple
but effective stroke of his strategy • the
cornering of Yon Spee’s squadron was a' good
move accomplished by battle-cruisers built
according to his idea. The clumsy-looking
but almost unsinkable monitors which were
so useful at the Dardanelles were another of
ms litter. Certainly the old seadog seems
still to have plenty of energy and initiative—
qualities which must be needed in a depart-
ment presided over by a feeble dilettante like
A. J. Balfour.
A relic of the old whaling days will
shortly fall down behind its rampart of pill
and corset advts. at Mosman (Sydney). For
years an old barn where the whale-hunters
used to store their gear has hidden modestly
behind a big hoarding near the wharf where
the modern suburbanite disembarks and
scrambles for the electric-trams. Now the
wreck has been officially cursed as unsani-
tary, and it will shortly be picked to pieces.
In its earliest days it housed many a keg of
illicit grog brewed in the gullies of Middle
Harbor.

t)ecided firmly, though “regretfully,” by
the S. Aus. Supreme Court, that there are
limits to even the Salv'army’s right to make
a nuisance of itself. The case was a very
strong one, the Army’s hall at Mount Gam-
bier having been erected within 20 feet of
an existing house, which thereupon became,
by the owner’s statement, practically un-
bearable as a residence —especially in case
of illness. The Court said that this question
of an injunction against noisy religious ser-
vices seemed to have never been raised
before in any land, though that of noisy
church-bells had. S.A. has now given a lead.
It affirmed the right of anybody to (1)
hold religious services; (2) sing in the
course of them; and (3) have reasonable
music with the singing. But it ruled out
as unnecessary and a nuisance (4) a band;
(5) applause; (0) “Hallelujah.”
OF THE LADY INFLUENZA.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
Grim blackness disconsolate round and about me,
Shot through every minute by tatters of light,
Dull crimson that somehow bedevil and flout me,
And make a worse Hell of the infamous night;
And close by my side, with her savage limbs gripping
me,
Mouth on my mouth, fierce breath scorching me
through,
Fondling and fumbling and tearing and ripping me,
Is my Lady Floo.
The flame of her body maddens and stings me
As she clings in the rage of her lust and bites.
From horror to horror of loathing she flings me....
Oh, for the solace of bygone nights—
Nights made glad by the slow sweet kisses
Of Tess disdainful and coaxing Sue!
To-night Heaven's barred, while the serpent hisses,
By my Lady Floo.
Never a man on the earth possessed her
With joy, or desired her for comfort’s sake.
Never a wandering lady caressed her,
.Eager her curious heats to slake.
Impotent 1, though her feverish rages
Shake me and harry me through and through ;
But ravenous she, as the slow night ages....
My Lady Floo!
The black vile jade tears my nerves asunder
And sucks my blood with her shuddering breath.
Dear, must your lovers wait long, I wonder,
Wait for you hopelessly, deep sweet Death ?
Come! Make me free of this trull that holds me,
Come when you will, for I’m calling to you!
Drag off this rentile that damns and enfolds me—
This Lady Floo!

THE FOOD QUESTION.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
In Melbourne an agitation has been started for the
registration and stricter supervision of eating houses.
One press correspondent stated that “Many of the
evils attributed to drink are really due to food.’
What’s meat to one is to another booze;
Who feels a craving base for pork or ham,
Corn beef and carrots, say, or even lamb,
May find these things his intellect confuse.
Aye, steak and onions, taken to excess,
Ofttimes have wrecked domestic happiness.
Seed-cake may land an oldster on his ear,
Or rouse him to unseemly levity,
And currant-bun with some may disagree,
Affecting them as others are by beer.
’Tis plain the eat and burden of the day
Can havoc with the public's morals play.
A brand-new Temp’rance League’s required, to see
That men shall not be led astray by food;
Such propaganda work should do much good;
And, in the int’rest of sobriety,
The League might ask the Government to fix
The closing hours of restaurants at six.

MAGNESIA HELPS DYSPEPTICS.
PATENT FOODS AND MEDICINES
NO LONGER NECESSARY. ,
Many dyspeptics have now discontinued
the use of expensive patent foods, harmful
drugs, medicines and artificial digestants,
and instead, following the advice often given'
an these columns, they just take half a tea-
spoonful of bisurated magnesia in a little
water after meals, with the result that they
not only save money but enjoy much better
health. Those who have once tried bisurated
magnesia never dread the approach of meal
times, because they know that this wonder-
ful antacid and food corrective, which can
so readily be obtained from any chemist, will
instantly neutralise acidity and prevent all
possibility of the food fermenting in the
stomach. Try this plan yourself, but mind
you get bisurated magnesia, as other forms
are unsuitable. — Advt.
How much longer are the Australian daily
papers going to invite Syd Kidman, the
“Cattle King,” to pull their legs and bite
the public’s ear? Whenever Kidman blows
into Melbourne or Sydney or Brisbane some
awed newspaper reporter asks him whether
he thinks meat is going to be dearer; and
Kidman, having tens of thousands of pounds
of meat to sell, explains that he is distressed
about it, but because of the drought, or the
rain, or the tick, or the paddymelon, or some-
thing he can’t see any prospect of cheaper
meat for some time to come. Some day,
since the news editors all seem to be under
the influence of the garrulous meat mon-
arch, an intelligent compositor will make
another happy mistake and say that it’s
because of Kidman that Kidman can only
see dear meat ahead. It will be more hon-
est than to blame the drought or the tick.
Anyway, neither the drought nor tbe tick
has made a million out of the business in,
say, 15 years.
THE MAN FOR THE JOB.
RECRUITION OFFICER: “ Any previous train-
iBILLJIM: “ My oath! Yorter see me killin'
pigs.”
This is the latest parable from Egypt. A
party of Billjims was moving over a gully
when a Turk was seen on the track for
home under a full head of steam. Promptly
tbe rifles were up to shoot, when one of the
•nmbills yelled: “No blanky fear! Let’s
have a bob in and the bloke who gets him
with the bayonet wins !”
. fc-N.l. : The Victorian policeman’s lot
is getting no happier. Some of him deserve
to be thoroughly miserable; but for the aver-
age man wdio gives full value in return for
his ninepence an hour, times are unjustifiably
nard and the Administration curiously un-
sympathetic. It seems incredible, for in-
stance, that a wealthy State like Victoria
should compel its John Cop to buy his own
uniform. The particular serge used is grow-
nig dearer and dearer, and so are Little Wil-
lie Cop s clothes and bread and jam and
louysticks. But by those in authority a
cheeseparing police-wage seems to be stunidly
regarded as good business. A starved or
sweated cop is liable to mean a venal cop,
soon or late; and there are signs that the
Victorian begins to feel the strain of being
upright on a low-down wage.

“Kopje”: Some Australian medical men
are discovering the official estimate of early
patriotism. When they volunteered anil
jomcl the A.I.F. in lyu the? 'also e?m
menced the prescribed
course of military
training with the
Army Medical Corps;
but before completing
the course they were
asked to fill vacancies
in a Base Hospital
then leaving, assur-
ance being given that
the fact that the
A.A.M.C. training was
uncompleted would be
no barrier to promo-
tion. Now, after being
a year or more on
active service, they
find themselves passed
over by young gradu-
ates and older men
who had taken the
precaution to stay
behind and get tied up
with the correct length
of red tape. Can any-
one hand up informa-
tion to show why a
month or two in an
Australian camp has
a higher military
value than a year’s
service in the field?
What is happening
means, of course, that
these men, several of
whom left good prac-
tices and their fami-
lies behind, will be
saying “Sir” to fledg-
lings who should be
picking up crumbs of
experience from sea-
soned birds. Mean-
while the families of
the early-to-act patri-
ots will continue to
live happily on per-
haps a fourth of their
former income, while
sonny, riesli from the Uni., will draw an
Gxtia hundred to sustain his new dignity as
a majah.

“Form Fours”: When the stay-at-home
war-critic notes with pride that the forces
in Mesopotamia have taken Sniffah or
Stinkah, “a village of great strategic value ”
he omits to mention what Sniffah consists
£ f '-J B , ut . perhaps he doesn’t know. Usually
Sniffah is constructed of palm-frond mats
stretched over hoops of reeds, and when the
smudgy population feels that the fleas have
become too fierce and frequent, the whole
show is pulled down and set up again
beyond hopping distance. Then a few
hundredweight of homeless and foodless fleas
jump madly about the desert in search of
au expeditionary force, and the carefully-
drawn war map is more unreliable than
ever.

“Lee-ob” Let me introduce the United
States whaling barque Chas. W. Morgan, a
survivor of the old bri-
gade of blubber-hunters
in the South Seas. Last
time I heard of her she
and the Andrew Hicks,
another barque - rigged
ark, were cruising the
Norfolk Island and Ker-
madecs grounds. The
Morgan is well on in her
sixties; I saw her wad-
dling in to the Waitemata
a good many years ago
to discharge oil. She
looked what she was—a
hoary Rip Van Winkle of
the seas, a square-
sterned old fabric of the
tumble-in sides, built-
by- the-mile-and-cut-off-as-
wanted sort, with her
standing rigging all of
hemp as in the pre-iron
days. These old whalers
are hard to kill; they
are soaked from bow to
stern with the preserva-
tive oil of Thousands of
fish, and the Morgan I
calculate is good for a
century of sea-battering.
Another staunch veteran
of the whale business that
used to run in North
M.L. waters was the
Gayhead, a little barque
from New Bedford, and
there were one or two
’Frisco cruisers of the
same rig, the Alaska and
California to wit. and
the Canton, of Massachu-
setts.
In Melbourne Divorce Court the other
afternoon Justice Hood said to a petitioning
husband who had been coerced into matri-
niony when he was 21: “When the clergy-
man asked you if you would take this
woman to be your wedded wife, why did you
not answer ‘No’?” The petitioner: “I was
not very well at the time.”
One of the queer consequences of the
war is a shortage of jurymen in England.
Recently in several instances judges have
had to appeal to juries to stay and serve on
the next case. Naturally the woman suffra-
gists heard the cue, and now a howl is abroad
to allow women to “serve the country.” The
baby-bearing type of citizen would probably
nnd it a nuisance. But what a gorgeous
opportunity to the doughy dame who loves
to work overtime looking after other people’s
business !
Parson C. F. Andrews, who recently went
to Fiji for the Indian Government to report
on the conditions of coolie labor, gives some
straight talk on the subject from the moral,
if not from the economic side. Andrews,
who is a member of the Anglican “high
church” Cambridge mission at Delhi, is one
of the front-rank authorities on the Indian
nationalist movement. His book, “The
Renascence of India,” is the leading text-
book on the subject; and two years ago, at
the invitation of Indian nationalist leaders,
lie went to inquire into coolie troubles in
Natal. Of Fiji he writes :
When we reached Fiji we found that our worst
fears were confirmed. The moral condition of the
coolie “lines” —as the barracks are called —was
shocking beyond words. We could not bear the
thought of innocent little children being brought up
in them. The percentage of adult women to adult
men is less than 40 to the 100, and the consequence
has been an almost complete breakdown of married
life. The moral evil has not stopped at the
coolie lines,” but has passed out beyond them to
the free Indian population. There also marriage has
gone almost shipwreck. Gambling habits have
increased side by side with sexual vice, and the con-
clusion we came to was that the indenture system
of labor should be brought to an end as speedily as
possible. Just as we found out in Natal, so also
we found in Fiji. The indenture system of Indian
labor was ruinous to human freedom and a direct
incentive to vice.
Andrews adds that the suicide rate among
indentured Indians in Fiji is more than 20
times as high as that in India itself; and
he might have gone on to mention the fact
that our ‘‘colored fellow subjects” from
India’s coral strand provide 90 per cent, of
the criminal cases in the Fijian courts.
BUNKERED.
“I bet if a girl had the pluck to propose to
you, you wouldn't have the nerve to
refuse her!”
“Ooh, 7100 ! If a girl had the nerve to pro-
pose to me, I wouldn't have the pluck
to accept her.”
“Fibula” : When the troopship Sutherland’
was torpedoed four A.M.C. men on board
were medical students of Melbourne Uni.
They were playing poker when the shock
came. Each left at once for his post—but
not till they had pocketed the cards as dealt
and arranged to play on when next they met.
The four were together 36 hours later, but
the game was not continued, as one had
given his tunic containing his cards to an
injured Billjim and both Billjim and cards
were lost. If Billjim had known that a
hand of poker was iir his. coat he would
have passed it over before he delivered up
the ghost, no matter how long he kept the
ghost waiting.
THE ONLY THING THAT MATTERS.
Woman as viewed by woman when she first
displays the next season's fashion.
Melbourne’s tramway co. pursues the last
thrippence with consistent ardor. The other
day it was asked to follow the example of
the Motor ’Bus Co. and carry recruiting
sergeants free. The invitation was enthu-
siastically declined. Still, that won’t prevent
the new army being ready by June 30, when
the long and profitable career of the co
will come to an end. After that the trams
can carry the whole crowd free if they like.
The co.’s troubles!
ENTHUSIASM.

“We shall never sheath the sword until this
liquor evil is smashed and trodden under foot
(Cheers). We are roused, and we will drive our

We will nip it in the bud,
Ere this mountain’s awful wave
In its carnival of blood
Puts its foot upon the grave
Of the wrecked and ruined home,
Where its foul contagion sears
W'ith the subtlety of Rome!
We will smash it up 1 (Loud cheers).
Aye! The sword we will not sheath,
Nor the furrow cease to drive,
Till to draw the horrid teeth
Of the monster we contrive!
We will tread it in the dust,
And will maul it with our paws
Though in doing it we bust,
We will do it! (Loud applause.)
We are roused—our brolly’s up !
Let us wave the thing like mad
Till we’ve shattered ev’ry cup,
And no liquor’s to be had!
We will wallow deep in blood—
Let him face our gamp who dares!

Many bridegrooms are ill
When they swallow the pill,
The pill that is known as a wife;
’Tis the physic they take
For their love-pain and ache,
And they mostly get better for life.
But in long after-years,
Bringing laughter and tears,
When they think of their passion sublime,
And its cause and effect,
They are apt to reflect:
“I was not very well at the time.”

PERSGNAL

In Dr. Hugh Boyd, run over and killed by
his own car, a veteran Bendigonian of 50
years’ standing passed out. Dr. James Boyd,
his elder brother, was buying gold on early
Bendigo in partnership with the late John
Maclntyre, and when the competition of
the banks made the business unprofitable,
“Jimmy” sent to Glasgow for his brother
Hugh, and they started as partners in the
sawbones line, developing a very big prac-
tice. The brothers were the best-known
medical men in Bendigo for donkey’s years.
Both of them were shrewd mining investors
and made a good deal of money in the early
days. Boyd and Maclntyre built Bath
Corner on a ground lease from the City
Council, and did well out of that deal, too.
Then the doctor-brothers parted, and kindly
Hugh combined healing and share-dealing,
with directoring of companies as a sideline.
The medical family is now represented by
three nephews of Dr. Hugh Boyd—Dr. .T. D.
at Bendigo, and Drs. W. It. and T. 11. in
Melbourne. Their elder sister, Caroline,
was the first lady to sign the roll of the
Melbourne University as a matriculated
student.
All arguments as to the tallest soldier in
Australia’s army are ended by Trooper A. E.
Knickle, of Aramac (<).). He is 21 years
old and 6ft. llin. high. Address: Enoggera
camp.
Ages of Australian Premiers: W. M.
Hughes (Prime Minister), 52 next Septem-
ber; W. A. Holman (N.S.W.), in his 47th:
T. ,T. Ryan (Q.), 40 in July; Alec Peacock
(Vic.), 55 in June; Crawford Vaughan
(S.A.), 42 in July; and Jack Scaddan
(W.A.), 40 in August. Four of these are
Australian born.
It does not seem possible to make out
Surgeon-Major Hinton, who claimed to have
his 103rd birthday in Adelaide last week, as
anything but a rare and genuine centen-
arian. Not only was he in the Sikh and
Mahratta campaigns of 70 years back, but
lie was admitted as a qualified M.R.C.S. on
May 25, 1835 —-over 80 years ago. May 7,
1813 —two years before Waterloo —-is the
birth-date he claims.
Died lately at Yonkers (U.S.A.), Dr.
Joseph Jacobs, reckoned one of the most
brilliant scholars produced in modern times
by the chosen race. Born at Sydney in 1854,
Jacobs was one of the earliest pupils of now-
deceased A. B. Weigall at Sydney Grammar
School, whence he went to Cambridge in the
early ’7o’s. He specialised in history, and
soon became well known as a writer and lec-
turer, and as a first-rank authority on folk-
lore. After travelling some distance along
the Inky Way in the Cold Country he went
to America in 1900 to supervise the produc-
tion of the Jewish Encyclopaedia, and at
the time of his death was editor of the
American Hebrew.
It looks as if a man can last a long time
on a plain diet of Gospel and Cold Tea. The
other day the retiring president of the Vic-
torian Methody Conference exulted over 19
veterans who had been ministering for terms
ranging from 63 years to 51. Most of them
belonged to the old Wesleyan Convention
before John Wesley’s followers fixed up to
go marching down to glory with the Bible
Christians and Primitives. That was a mere
decade ago—a hardly noticeable lapse of thne
to these St. Peters, who must have had an
interesting hour swapping experiences with
their old business rivals.
A cable reports that Colonel Cox Taylor
has been given command of one of the
Artillery brigades on the other side. Appar-
ently to fit in with the plans of the Aus-
tralian military people he was sent away
in charge of an Ammunition Column, which
is a sort of glorified bullock team, and it
seemed like a waste of a man with excep-
tional experience among big guns. Taylor
joined the permanent forces away back in
the days when Jersey’s red whiskers floated
over the uniform of the Commander-in-Chief
of the forces in N. S. Wales, and since then
his vigorous language has been heard in
most of the forts of Australia, from Thurs-
day Island, his first command, to Queens-
cliff, his last.
THE SINNERS.
“ Brother, I feci reckless.”
“Then let’s he sports. Let us sit together on
the beach at Manly.”
Members of the N.S.W. State Assembly
who have enlisted: Braund (killed), Larkin
(killed), George Cann, Carmichael, Chaffey,
Dunn and Fern. Besides these, Onslow and
Nicholson are on transport duty, and ’Enley
is a Red Cross commissioner in Egypt. No
other House in Australia has put up so good
a record: and even this one is as remark-
able for names that are missing as for those
that are present.
At Mataura (M.L.) there is a family
named Jones that consisted of seven sons
ali of military age. A month or two back
these boys reckoned their turn had come,
so they enlisted in a heap, were all accepted
for service and went into the same regjjnent.
They did their training and had their final
leave together, and sailed away in one lump
in search of trouble.

“Ef you’ll chop us a couple o’ barrer-oads

Wassiamull, the podgy Indian gentleman
who was Melbourne's best-known seller of
silks, is no more. For years he had been a
feature of the city shopscape; and, while lie
sold plenty of cheaper goods, it was always
possible for seekers after the genuine thing
to buy it at his store. Most of the silk sold
in Melbourne is loaded; Wassiamull either
considered it more moral or better policy to
stock a large proportion of the unimpeach-
able article. At any rate, he did well enough
to die in India —at something over 80, which
w r as a fair thing.
In the last generation the name of the
Count de Castelnau, who was French Consul
in Victoria, was well known in Australia —
and particularly on the “Eastern ITill” of
Melbourne, where he lived and had his Con-
sulate. One of the family is now attracting
notice in command of the French armies at
the Western Front. Noel, this one, was
born on Christmas Eve 65 years ago. He
was in the Franco-German war when he
was only 19, and was a captain even then.
Since that day he has had a dozen children,
of whom three sons have been killed in the
present war.
J. V. E. Gregg Macgregor, who brought
back a D.C.M. with him to Sydney the other
day, was an Anglican curate at Scone
(N.S.W.) when the Devil came out of Berlin,
ile was one of the first Australian parsons
to enlist in the A.M.C., and for 16 smoky
weeks he carried half a stretcher at Anzac
without stopping bullet or shrapnel. Enteric
got him at last, but a convalescent spell in
England has made him fit again, and he is
going to let the pulpit stay empty till the
war is over. Macgregor is a real high-church-
man—about 6ft. Tin. high—and Abdul must
be a rotten shot to have missed him for 112
days consecutively.
In the excitement of the war not much ink
was spilt over the memory of octogenarian
Lord Burnham, of the London Daily Tele-
graph. Many years ago, when he was Mr.
Levy Lawson, he got a lot of painful per-
sonal advt. from the attacks of Henry
Labouchere in London Truth. “Labby”
scoffed at Lawson as a Levy who had
changed his name, and derided the Jew-made
Daily Telegraph for publishing an effusive
appreciation of Christ and Christianity on
Good Friday. Whereupon Levy Lawson, on
behalf of himself and his father, assaulted
Labby with a riding-whip in the Strand.
A law-suit followed. Labby sued Levy for
assault and battery, and Levy sued Labby
for libel. The point he wanted to make was
that he had changed his name to Lawson to
gratify the ghost of an uncle who had left
him a lot of money. It was not an ample
justification of his disloyalty to the Hebrew
family patronymic, but it sufficed. In 1903
he became Baron Burnham, if you please,
and then his ancestors didn’t matter any
more. He was at rest in the Lord, so to
speak.

The ghost of the late Chief Justice
floated around the S. Aus. Full Court
the other day when the Bench came
to decide whether the Salv’army was
entitled to sing “Hallelujah” and bang
the big drum as hard as it liked. In
his last days the old Chief remembered his
fathers and the little Bible Christian par-
sonage where he was born and its prayer-
meetings and revival rallies, and he simply
couldn’t pull himself together to dp the
hard, cold thing the lawyer in him told him
he ought to do. So the case affecting the
Salv’army’s rights was .hung up for month
after month. Then he died, and the Court
did the plain thing; but, remembering its old
Chief’s tears —it came to that at one stage
of the hearing—and remembering also that
he was a great Judge in spite of his little
weaknesses, it decided “regretfully” that it
couldn't do as it knew the little Chief would
have liked to do had he dared.
A HALLUCINATION.
HER FATHER: “So you think you need

SUITOR: “Yes, sir.”
HER FATHER: “Well, nothing hut marriage
will upset the illusion.”
James Long, who for years held tlie
biscuit-making trade of the Ballarat dis-
trict in the hollow of his hand, died the
other day at Portland. For the past decade
or so he had lived at Burswood, the olci
Edward Henty dwelling overlooking Port-
land Bay. Before Long’s advent Burswood
had been occupied by the late general-mel-
- James Trangmar, who bought tn
place when Henty died, and followed tie
sluggish fortunes of Victoria’s most ancien
town for more than half a century. L°
who had been thrice mayor of Balia 1
East, kept his light shining gently wheni ne
“retired” to Portland, and presently spoi
the rabbit-skins of office once more,
was 86 when he left for good.

Value from the Military Standpoint
The essence of value from a military standpoint is dependability—and this applies as much to an Officer’s Uniform
and equipment as to anything else with which he may have to deal, on either Home or Foreign Service.
And it is just this quality of “Austral” Military Outfitting that recommends itself to Military Men.
Not only have they the assurance of a high-quality standard in every case, both of workmanship and
material, but also the appreciable certainty of absolute correctness in every detail of strict Military requirement.
Judged from the Military standpoint “Austral” Field Service Uniforms and Equipment reach quite an
exceptional standard of value.

George Crowley is the most unconventional
life-insurance manager in Australia. If a
thing seems good enough to him, he never
holds back from doing it because nobody has
done it before. He doesn’t even hold back
because somebody is likely to laugh at him
for attempting it. There are a whole
crowd of people in the business who
dot their insurance i’s and cross their insur-
ance t’s very carefully and shrug their
shoulders when Crowley is mentioned.
But they don’t all manage societies whose
income has trebled in 10 years, while the
expense rate has been reduced by 50 p.c.;
there are some of them who earn a good deal
less than p.c. on their mean funds ; and
very few of them have attempted a 3 p.c.
net premium valuation. True, the City
Mutual hasn’t yet completed its valuation on
that basis; but it appears to be now almost
ready to begin. In that connection the
managing director’s comment is characteristic-
ally fresh. The society contemplates a 3
p.c. net premium valuation, he says, though
“the necessity for it in these days of increas-
ing interest rates does not seem to be very
obvious ; but as the adoption of the standard
means to the policy-holders still greater
security—the main, if not the only, thing in
life assurance, after all, that counts” —the
directors have decided to go ahead.
How the reduction of the assumed rate of
interest means greater security to the policy-
holders is worth a line or two. Suppose you
want to accumulate £lOO in 20 years. Obvi-
ously if the money is earning only 3 p.c. you
must have more in hand after (say • 10 years
than if the money is earning 5 p.c. Put £1
a year aside at 3 p.c. compound interest and
in 10 years you have about £ll 9s. 3d.; put
it by at 5 p.c. compound interest and you
have £l2 11s. Hence, if an insurance office
assumes that it is going to earn only 3 p.c.,
it must have a bigger insurance fund or re-
serve than if it assumed it would earn 5 p.c.
The increase of reserve is achieved by the
simple process of hanging on to the so-called
profits instead of dividing them in bonuses.
The reduction in the assumed rate of interest
doesn’t of course add a farthing to the money
actually earned, nor does it make it a cent
less; all that happens is that, instead of
getting your insurance increased from £lOO
to £lO2, the extra £2 is written off or put
by to make it more dead sure that you will
get the £lOO.
The City Mutual, while thus aiming to give
its policy-holders extra security at the
expense of bonuses, is not at all indifferent to
the advertising value of bonuses. Hence, no
doubt, this claim :
The bonus paid on policies for the whole of life
was at the rate of £27 10s. per £lOOO, which is,
so far as the directors are aware, the highest paid
by any life office in the British Empire.
It isn’t at all impossible. Bonuses come
from three sources. (1) From savings in
expenses. On the basis of calculation
adopted for many years by Tiie Bulletin
the City Mutual’s new business is costing
just under 80 p.c. of first-year premiums,
which is a strikingly good performance. (2)
From a better-than-average record with
regard to claims. (3) From interest earn-
ings in excess of those assumed. The
assumed rate is probably 31 p.c., whereas
actually £5 7s. Od. p.c. is earned on all the
funds. This unusual return may be snarled
at on the ground that the society does a
variety of loan business which bigger offices
won’t look at. But by far the most of the
money seems to be invested in conventional
enough securities: —
Government stock .. £148,470 = 17 p.c.
Mortgages .. .. 398,830 = 45 ~
Freeholds . . .. 133,962 = 16 „
Policies . . .. 62,843 =» 7 ~
Miscellaneous .. 133,391 = 15 „
The miscellaneous includes shares in public
cos., various debentures, and outstanding
premiums.
Altogether this is not the best-looking list
of assets in Australia. But they may be all
right for all that. Freeholds, for instance,
are a blot on some insurance cos.’ balance-
sheets, because the properties floated in at
their boom values. On the other hand, just
as-some people bought in cheap and sold out
at a big profit to those insurance offices, so
some other insurance offices may buy cheap
and sell out presently at a big profit. Insur-
ance offices are not always fools at real
estate deals. The management of this con-
cern, anyhow, is prepared to back its
opinion, not merely with regard to property,
but as to most things. Apparently it realises
that it will make some mistakes and some
losses; wherefore of late years the profits
realised on trading have gone into a. reserve
for contingencies, which is now £32,500 in
credit. But it knows that when a man
has half a million it is generally regarded as
comparatively easy to make another half a
million ; and it evidently doesn’t see why it
should be any harder to make the second half-
million when the first half belongs to a
society. To some extent the thing is an
experiment; but the results so far at any
rate have been quite comforting.

The question the investor ought to put to
himself is not as to the past but as to the
probable future of this and other brewing cos.
The past is beyond question. In seven years
the visible profit in excess of the dividends
has been just over £150,000, or nearly 40
p.c. of the capital; and there is a nice lump
put away besides that, or this paper is a bad
guesser. The following shows in another
way what has been done in five years:—
Jan.,’ll. July,’ls. Jan.,’l6.
Liabilities, less cash . . £25,248 £78,885 £72,120
Breweries, hotels and plant 322,638 399,240 400,636
Stocks 55,712 90,147 81,500
Book debts .. . . 112,767 174,643 180,649
Gross profit on brewings,
etc 56,107 94,635 101,887
Rent and interest . . 6,755 10,139 9,733
Management, wages and
charges .. .. 36,107 72,260 82,099
So, while liabilities have grown by only
£46,872, the co. has added £78,000 to its
breweries, hotels and plant (besides all it
has charged up to working exes), £26,000
to its stocks, and £68,000 to its book debts.
And the figures showing the steady growth
of the gross profit on brewings, etc., give
some idea of the growth of the business.
There is no doubt at all about the froth on
the pot of the Past.
But there is a whole lot of doubt as to
what the barman will draw out of the Cellar
of the Future. Many people think that the
war is going to make us all virtuous and
give up cake and ale. Directly it will pro-
bably do nothing of the sort. On the con-
trary, this war will do what no other war
has ever done if it makes wowsers of the
men who go through it. The tendency has
always been the other way. But indirectly
the war is likely to have its serious effect
upon the Trade. Especially since women
came into the political count of heads, the
majority has had no love for Mr. Bung ; and
only a little thing has been needed to turn it
to active antagonism. There have been quite
enough little things of late to do the trick ;
and more and more restrictions are going
to be placed upon the great Bung industry.
Thus, when Pearce, Minister for Defence,
decided against the wet canteen, and drove
the khaki out of camp to get a drink —or
drunk, as the case may be —he did a shame-
fully bad thing for the young soldier, but
a still worse thing for the Trade. So he
was a better wowser than he thought.
The attack on the hours of the pubs is
likely to have a serious effect on the
breweries. Beer is their backbone, so to
speak ; and if the biggest beer-drinkers don’t
take away the liquor inside their shirts they
won’t take it away at all. Some liquor no
doubt will be carted home in billies and
bottles; but not much. On the other hand,
the restriction of the hours of liquor-selling
may save the Trade from the very real peril
of total prohibition. It certainly will push
that heroic remedy into the remote distance.
Meantime the constant uncertainty in which
the Trade lives will keep others from coming
in to compete with the present breweries,
etc., notwithstanding the increase of popula-
tion and the even more important increase of
wages. Altogether, therefore, the outlook is
much less gloomy than it is for a good many
industries that seem to be far less directly
in the line of fire.

The records which this co. is putting up are
very remarkable. Well-known restaurants
are closing their doors, declaring that they
simply can’t feed their old customers with
provisions at present prices. Several of
them, attached to city hotels, unquestionably
lost a good deal of money last year. Yet
this co. has been making large profits. In
fact, the “gross profit on manufacturing and
trading” was actually larger in the last half
of 1915 than in the last half of 1914; the
small shrinkage in the net profit appears to
be due to a bigger wages bill, larger expenses
in the stables, and heavier taxes. It may be
good luck, it may be design; certainly this
co.’s salvation lately has been in the fact
that its main business has been in the tart
that can be kept till to-morrow instead of
the roast beef that must be eaten to-day or
not at all. And in the days to come, when
we are paying off the war loans instead of
merely spending them, the trade in the com-
paratively inexpensive tart will probably go
on scoring. It may not be this co. that will
do it: whether it is this or some other will
depend on whether this or some other is the
better managed.
At the outset the co. had to pay dividends
on about £70,000 of capital, and no less than
£45,000 of it was represented by goodwill.
Circumstances favored the management, and
the big job was done: not only did the co.
pay 10 p.c. throughout, but so much surplus
profit was accumulated that to-day the whole
of the capital is represented by tangible
assets. Here is the position

Calls paid in advance. . .. 5,027
Reserves as above .. .. 5,839
Half-year’s dividend . . . . 5,313
At the outset the co. would have been handi-
capped had it been struck by a strong com-
petitor who had to earn interest only on the
capital invested in actual plant. To-day that
handicap is gone, because the co. has now
all its capital represented by plant and sim-
ilar tangible things. Certainly if the busi-
ness went to pieces, the plant, etc., would
probably fetch far less than book value, and
for that reason Sargents isn’t in the gold-
edged class of investments. But it has shown
that it can earn excellent profits under the
most diverse circumstances, and it is in a
stronger position now than ever it was.

From an observation printed upon the waist-
band of the table it will be seen that nomi-
nal reserves were created by the easy process
of writing up assets. In the old days a lot
of the capital was represented by “water”
poured into the co. by J. D. Williams, the
cute Yankee showman who founded it —a
showman with imagination enough to project
big enterprises, but with not enough busi-
ness method to keep them off the rocks. Just
before J. D. Williams was invited to step
off the bridge the bigger people in the pic-
ture business in Australia formed a sort of
combine consisting of two cos.; and though
Williams stood out his successor, W. B.
Miller, came in. Practically the whole busi-
ness was sold to these two cos. for shares ;
and those shares are counted in at then-
face value. Hence the sudden jump in
the assets, and the consequent easy conver-
sion of a deficit into reserves. This paper
isn’t going to say that the operation had
no value. No doubt the fixing-up of the
combine saved a huge amount of waste. But
the actual conversion of the old assets into
shares in other cos. was a mere bookkeep-
ing matter, which of itself didn’t make the
co. a penny better off.
The J. D. Williams capital is £15Q,506,
and reserves bring the total funds up to
£237,907 ; but no less than £195,000 of that
is represented by shares in the two combine
cos - officially the Union Theatres, Ltd.,
and Australasian Films, Ltd. —and there is
no telling what part of that £195,000 is good-
will froth. Probably not much more than
£50,000 of it is represented by solid, tangible
assets. Apart from these shares and £23,391
of combine debentures, the co. has the f 1
lowing assets : —•

Surplus assets.. ..£20,030 £26,249 £22~80l
That is to say, the co. owns £22,801,
its interest in the two combine cos.; and as
these present accounts don’t of course tell
you what the assets, etc., of the combine
cos. are, shareholders may see for themselves
that the document now put in their hands
is practically valueless. The only informa-
tion given about the two cos. in which five-
sixths of the funds are sunk is that “had it
not been for the imposition of a duty on
films, which has had the effect of curtailing
the profits of Australasian Films, Ltd., your
directors would have had a very much more
satisfactory statement to present. Apart
from this,” the directors say, “the parent
cos. have deemed it wise, by reason of in-
creased competition, to husband their
resources, and in consequence the distribu-
tion of divs. by those cos. has not been as
great as their disclosed profits would have
allowed.” That tells the shareholder in this
co. nothing definite. It merely hints that
the future isn’t expected to be all bright.
So the man who buys these shares buys a
pig which is for the most part in a bag, and
about which nothing is known except that
he will presently have to face increased com-
petition for husks to eat and get fat on.

it looks more than coincidence that the

they are not even now anything to get ex-
cited about, especially as £283 of last year’s
total was a non-recurring profit on the sale
of a patch of land at the rear of the pre-
tentious pub. Nor do the ordinary trading
profits appear to be at all understated, seeing
that furniture, fittings and plant remain in
the accounts at the £12,624 which stood
against the item two years ago. In other
words, though repairs and renewals have
been charged up to working exes., nothing
has been written off against general depre-
ciation. Nevertheless, considering the high
price of provisions and the large number of
young bloods who are away in Egypt and
thereabouts, the figures for the past couple
of years are encouraging; and given a man-
agement with a keen eye for costs and the
prevention of waste —the rock on which big
hotels of this class are most liable to spill
themselves —the fine situation of the Pacific
should earn fair money for the shareholders.
Capital is £35,000, and there is a debenture
debt of £20,000. The total is represented bv
the premises and fittings, leaving the stock
and sundries to be represented by overdraft
and other liabilities, these two items reach-
ing £4931.

You can’t stop an avalanche —don’t try. If your
enthusiasm doesn’t carry you away—the avalanche
will. Like “Chromol” Belting, it drives ahead and
keeps going till the goal is reached. The stiffest
drive and the most severe conditions do not stop
“Chromol” from keeping the pulleys up to then-
work. It never slips or jerks—but grips the pulleys
and gives maximum power all the time. Used
exclusively on many of the heaviest mining drives
in the Commonwealth. Mineral tanned, durable and
pliable, it will stand every test. J. C. Ludowici &

ALUMINOFERRIC is used by the Sydney Water
Board, New South Wales Public Water Supply Depart-

for precipitating impurities and clarifying water in
reservoirs, cattle dams, etc. It is simply thrown
into the reservoir in the form of a solid cake, or
dissolved and added as a liquid. In three hours’
time the most discolored water will be as clear as
crystal. One pound will clear over 2000 gallons of
water. It is exceedingly cheap and quite harmless.

Alec Campbell sang Broken Hill Water
Sunply’s swan song the other day. The

ranging methods, and sprang to £5OOO,
which the co. accepted. The Department
also paid £4748 for odds and ends ; and alto-
gether the co. expects to have £57,373 to
distribute— perhaps a trifle more. Share-
holders will get ss. at once, and something

Broken Hill South has been keeping its
ore reserves up to 3,350,000 tons for several
terms past; and there has always been the
comfortable feeling that the lode was still
underfoot at the bottom level. But one line
iu one table in the last report throws a
shadow on the sun. The matter can be put
this way:—
V alue.
A N
Lead. Silver. Zinc.
1170 ft. level •• •• 15.4 p.e. 9.2 oz. 15.7 p.c.
1270 ft. level (bottom). . 9.8 „ 3.2 „ 9.6 „
Average of ore milled last
half 14 - 6 » 7 - 5 ” 14 - 8 ”
The 1170 ft. figures are so much better than
those for the whole mine, that things seemed
to be improving the deeper manager Wain-
wright probed. Now the little stoping thus
far done on the 1270 ft. level disturbs that
pleasant reflection. It may of course be
only a poor patch or two that the co. has
had the bad luck to strike first; but the
point is worth watching, for if values have
slumped like this there will be a steady fall
in the grade of ore fed to the mill as the
bottom level is more and more drawn on.
Occidental, Cobar (N.S.W.), treated
17,582 tons last half-year for a gross return
of £26.924, representing a profit, after allow-
ing £1179 for depreciation, of £1327, equiva-
lent to Is. 6d. per ton. The mine manager
reports that the 540 level will be cut out
within the next few months, and supplies
will then be drawn chiefly from the 640 level,
while a little may be expected from the
740 level. From this it looks as though
development has not been advanced of late.
The manager’s report further states that
“the high residue value is due partly to
treatment of past accumulations on the sur-
face, but primarily to insufficient grinding.
A marked improvement in the extraction is
improbable until grinding plant is modern-
ised.” The supply of firewood is also caus-
ing the co. some anxiety, the woodcarters
being at present on strike for an advance
in price. The co. has threatened to replace
wood by coal, but that might be even more
expensive. In the mine, the last six months
w r as practically a non-stop run, and there
have been no industrial troubles; but as
labor is at present arguing with the Great
Cobar for higher wages, it is safe to bet
that the Occidental’s turn will come.

The Japs are nosing around Broken Hill,

To the end of last year Westralia’s State
batteries had milled over a million tons of
gold ore for a return by amalgamation and
cyanidation of nearly 4£ million pounds sterl-
ing. About 70.000 tons of tin ore had also
been treated for a yield of a shade under
£90,000.

A co. with a nominal capital of £2750,
called up to £l5OO. is being formed to acquire
the Golden Spinifex at Duketon (W.A.).
The show yielded about 1850 oz. from 2640
tons prior to 1906, but had to be aban-
doned owing to high costs and bad ground.
The owner gets a little less than a half in-
terest and £2OOO out of profits for parting
with the property and plant. The venture
is weakly financed, and for that reason alone
looks a doubtful one.
* * * *
Yuanmi (W.A.) claims that on Septem-
ber 30 last it had 42,500 tons of 435. ore
blocked out, compared with 45.562 tons of
41s. ore three months previously. Nothing
below the No. 3 level was taken into
account, but the inclusion of this ground
in the next estimate is expected to swell
the figures. Since September the crosscut
at No. 6 level has intersected the lode, which
assayed 525. for sft. The opening up of a
shoot in the north end of the No. 5 level
has also been a feature of recent develop-
ment—a surprise, too, as pay ore was not
expected until the workings had got further
north. Co. has paid the first deposit of
£l5OO on one of its Warriedar options, and
has installed a treatment plant. The type
is new to Westralia; the gold is to be
recovered by decantation. A trial run is
alleged to have left only Is. 9d. per ton in
the residues. With the one or twd excep-
tions Yuanmi’s neighbors are hung up for
water.
For about the fiftieth time since the Act
was passed the Westralian Government is
being urged to insist on every co. operating
iu the State having a local office. All cos.
are supposed to have registered offices in
the West and to keep a register for trans-
fers ; but the Act is mostly ignored. In
many cases there is no local register for
transfers, and scrip has to be sent to
Adelaide or Melbourne, causing a delay of
some weeks. Dealers can glean nothing
whatever concerning developments and other
vital information from these local offices
until the news telegraphed east has been
published and mailed back to the west.
Star Exploration, Ltd., has just issued
another annual report. The co. was formed
iu 1910 by Hoover, Cordner James and
others to acquire 300,000 tons of old resi-
dues, £19,000 cash and some share interests
from the Hannan’s Star, and to set up in
business as a mine buyer. It didn’t buy
any mines, however, and after discovering
that a lot of the tailings it had bought would
not pay to treat, it left Kalgoorlie and
went “abroad.” Now all it has to remind it
of the Golden Mile is a block of Lake View
and Stars. The report states that the capi-
tal has been written down from £70,000 to
£47,372, in 947,454 shares of Is. each, of
which 452,456 shares (£22,627) have been
issued as fully paid. It deplores the fact
that the war is making it difficult to realise
on investments or to initiate and carry
through profitable business.
Clarks, Charters Towers, is finding out that
even a good little mine may be overloaded, so
the Board has convened a meeting to reduce
the number of shares from 180,000 to 90,000
and raise their nominal value from ss. to
10s. The capital thus remains at £45,000.
Last half-year 960 tons gave £9552, which
enabled the Board to return the Government
subsidy of £l3OO. It’s a gamble to back a
reef in this part of the field to make good at
depth.
* * * *
Unless a miracle happens, the Great Fitz-
roy, Mount Chalmers (Q.), will go under
the hammer on March 31. Two years ago
Chalmers was one of the most prosperous
towns in Queensland; now there isn’t even
a Chinese shopkeeper. And if the splendid
plant is sold piecemeal, as is the apparent
intention, another mining township will
have disappeared from the map. Yet Fitz-
roy looks to have claims to another run for
its money. There is no question about the
reserves of ore, although the stuff is difficult
to treat. When the concern grounded the
last time copper was less than £6O per ton
(for a long time before that it had been
nearer £5O), and the Australian Metal Co.
had suddenly stopped making advances
against the product of the mine. Then the war
came, and what was intended to be merely
a temporary stoppage became permanent.
The loss on the last six months’ working
was represented only in the cost of manage-
ment in Melbourne —a matter of a few
thousand pounds. Since then copper has
soared up to nearly £lOO a ton. The pro-
position that awaits attention is the finding
of £25,000 to fend off the debenture-holders
who are forcing the sale, and another £20.000
to provide the locker with some dry powder
until the first crop of copper is ready for
harvesting. Rockhampton ought to be able
to find this money with one hand. But it
won’t. And the reason is that the men who
sit behind the big balances in those parts
cannot be dragged into mining with a team
of bullocks. A good many years back some
of them were caught between wind and
water in the Mount Morgan boom, or were
also badly stung in the Tarangaba affair.
Since then they have unreservedly subscribed
to the Yankee definition that “a mine is a
hole in the ground owned by a liar,” and
have kept to the safe mortgage over house-
hold furniture and effects, or liens on crops
and wool. A syndicate has suggested that
the Government should join forces with it
to give the mine another run. But the
Government is being asked to take over so
many things, from pubs to meatworks, and
as it has only about 21d. in the Treasury, the
prospects in this quarter are not promising.
Lyell Blocks, after strenuous attempts to
pick up the downward continuation of the
North Lyell shoot, recently bumped into
solid hematite in the 1300 ft. drive. This
working runs alongside the North Lyell
boundary, near which the shoots of ore have
poised for 300 ft. As it was anticipated that
the hematite would carry yellow ore, the
news that splashes of chalcopyrite or
bornite were bespangling the face of the
drive did not create a stir. Still, the bulls
are looking to a hefty gamble in Blocks at
any time.
* * * *
North Mount Farrell (Tas.) is producing
ore at top speed while the price of lead is high.
On an average the co. raises 6000 tons each
six months, but last half-year its total was
8298 tons, returning 1295 tons concentrates,
averaging 550 z. silver and 55£ p.c. lead.
No. 6 level is the most heavily drawn on,
and the stones are getting near their limit.
In the No. 7 level there isn’t much evidence
of the shoots carrying down in size and rich-
ness. Present ore reserves are 4700 tons,
against 3400 tons six months ago; so,
though the mine hasn’t gone back, it mostly
lives from hand to mouth.
* . * * *
The heart of T. ,T. Whaley’s report to the
shareholders of Ocean Oil, Ltd.: —
At 730 ft. the drill entered black sand, which con-
tinued for 45ft. This sand when placed in a
trough with water was critically examined, and its
general character and the fact that small black
particles rose to the surface which, on contact with
the air, burst and spat, leaving an unmistakable
oily surface on the water, thoroughly convinced me,
and a test by an analytical chemist verified my con-
clusions. This settles beyond all reasonable dispute
that oil exists in the Kingston district, and in my
opinion it is now only a question of further develop-
ment to locate prolific oil sands.
By the way, and as a matter of no financial
importance whatever, at a depth of about
250 ft. the bore came upon a number of very
well-preserved sharks’ teeth. It is suggested
that they may have belonged to a former
generation of company promoters.
The Rimu Options Co., which has under
offer 1000 acres of terrace and alluvial
ground near Hokitiki (M.L.), has received
a favorable report from Frank Powell, on
the strength of which capital has been sub-
scribed in Sydney to take over part of the
holding. The average value from a series
of bores put down by Powell was 19d. per
cubic yard. Hitherto it has been represented
that a large outlay of money would be neces-
sary to bring in w 7 ater for sluicing, but
Powell thinks that much of the area can be
worked by dredges, and this system is to be
adopted.
Austral Malay has practically cut loose
from Austral. Bolivia, which it promoted.
Owing to delays in shipping, the latter co.’s
two engineers could not reach South America
before the free option expired, and it then
became necessary to put up £3OOO in order
to hold the rights of purchase. Though the
Austral Malay and Austral Bolivia cos. have
a lot of information about the property under
offer, they have no reports from their own
officers. The payment of the £3OOO was
therefore speculative. And as the policy of
the Austral Malay is to cut out the specula-
tive element wherever possible, it was decided
to dissociate the two cos. altogether. The
Austral Malay co. therefore sold its holding
of Bolivia shares at par, offering them to its
own scrip-holders in the first place. A pre-
liminary report from Potosi may be expected
within a week or so. If the option is exer-
cised it will be the biggest foreign mine
purchase Australia has ever made. The
present Spanish owner wants £BO,OOO cash,
besides a 25 p.c. share interest. The
property consists of irregular river flats
which have been epriched for 400 years by
the tailings from the historical silver and tin
mines of Potosi.
* * * *
IJmeari, the Australian-owned Philippine
dredging proposition, still supplies share-
holders with glittering figures; but unfor-
tunately the butcher and the baker won’t
accept them in payment for meat and bread.
“Owing to the absence of much free gold,”
the directors say, “it has been thought the
dredge was passing over poor ground.” But
nothing of the kind—the tailings go £3l per
ton. “That is to say, on a most conserva-
tive basis there appears to be at least £70,000
per week going back into the river in these
tailings.” Of course, “financial assistance is
required immediately to enable the directors
to take the necessary steps to recover these
values.” It may seem absurd to mention
such a trifle; but what about the Is. 6d.
worth of free gold per cubic yard which was
formerly reported to exist over an immense
area?

G. A. Lawson writes: Re Whear Roberts’s
par. (B. 24/2/TG) on gold coated with man-
ganese. Many years ago I had in my office
in Melbourne a lump of jet black mineral
which was used as a paper-weight. It had
on the side small rounded nodules as smooth
as glass. A mine-manager on handling it one
day expressed the opinion that it contained
some metal much heavier than iron. He took
it to an assay office close by, and soon re-
turned with the information that the “pim-
ples” were gold. The specimen was promptly
consigned to the melting-pot, and the bank
returned me £l4 for it. How I got it or
where it came from I know not.
“Billy Blue”: Re the local manufacture
of firebricks for the B. H. Prop. Steel Works
at Newcastle and the adaptability of Aus-
tralian fireclays (B. 2/3/T6). The latter
was proved some 35 years ago in Illawarra.
The late Patrick Lahiff, then manager of the
Mount Pleasant Coal and Iron Co., projec-
ted a small blast furnace at the works near
Wollongong, but was faced with the diffi-
culty of procuring firebricks. Prospecting
the co.’s mineral land he found a seam of
fireclay, from which he made high-class
bricks, built his furnace, and ran out a quan-
tity of pig-iron from the Illawarra seams.
Experts who saw the bricks at the time pro-
nounced them of the best quality.
“Jaques”: “Nobby” (B. 2/3/’IG) com-
plains of the slackness of work at the New-
castle collieries. Let him incline an ear
or two. Before Christmas, when coal was
11s. per ton, trade in the inter-State mar-
kets was fairly brisk, and work, although
intermittent, enabled the miners to earn
about £2 10s. or £3 per week. The men
decided that this wasn’t enough, so they
demanded an increase. They got it, and the
proprietors raised the price to 12s. per ton
with the permission of the Necessary Com
modities Commission. Inter-State markets
refused to pay at that rate and decided to
draw on their stocks, and then buy only as
much as would keep them going. It will be
a long time before some of these stocks are
exhausted, and meantime the miner is trying
to live on about 255. per week.. As that is
a most difficult operation he is crying to
the Government to start public works to give
him a chance at shifting sand or something.
One complaint is that the Government s
action in prohibiting export oversea is the
cause of all the trouble, but this is a rotten
argument, as before Christmas, when the
restrictions were more or less in force, trade
was lively. There is no getting away from
the fact that the increase in the price of coal
is the cause of the whole trouble, and, what’s
more, the miner knows it.

Most fat people seem to think that the
only way to take off fat is to use dangerous
drugs, follow a starvation diet or take
strenuous exercise. But all this is nonsense,
and, thanks to the recent discovery of an
eminent scientist, thousands of men and
women are taking off several pounds of use-
less fat a week by simply rubbing on to the
fat part -hips, arms, chin or abdomen—a
simple lotion made by pouring a cup of hot
water over a dram of quassia chips ; let it
stand for a minute, then strain through a
cloth and add three ounces of Cirola Bark
Extract. Pour the mixture into a bottle
and apply night and morning, rubbing it in
with the hands for about 10 minutes, using
a circular motion, and the fat will almost
seem. to melt away before your very eves.

LETTER
Sydney, March 13, 1016.
My Dear Artnt. —
The Nurse Cavell Memorial Home sugges-
tion took some shape at a big gathering the
other afternoon. Cullen, C.J., was in the
chair. When the promoters talked of a rest
camp where tired nurses could put their feet
up, most of them seem to have had vague
ideas of a country eyrie. A home on the
blue hills beyond Penrith floated in a cloud
across the committee’s horizon. The very
generous offer of the W.E. Shaw home at
suburban Summer Hill bumps against this
ideal. Still, if none of our Best People
rush the memorialisers with a mountain
mansion, Summer Hill it will have to be.
Administrator Murphy, of Norfolk Island,
looked in here on his way to Melbourne.
He’s a surveyor by trade and a widower
by force of unhappy circumstance. He
records the impression that under the Com-
monwealth touch the Pine Isle is waking
from its long sleep. One-third of its male
population has volunteered for the Front.
Anything that remains over puts its muscle
into the fish-freezing industry.
So it's not the Colonel Lee that is popu-
larly known as “Sapper” who was recently
made a brigadier-general ( pro tem.). The
rank goes to Colonel George Lee, and
the tem. is while he’s State Com-
mandant in Queensland. The rank
goes nowadays with the job, and when
you lose the job you lose the rank
—unless you know the way into the Mini-
ster’s room. Oh, don’t fear —we’ll have
enough generals to go round all the after-
noon-teas when the war’s over.
Melba will come by a Matson liner
as far as Honolulu. There she will have her
mountain of baggage transferred to the
Niagara, which is due here about April 7.
Aide Firth is in Melbourne for a few
days. He is staying at Government House
with Chieftain Ferguson.
There was a rumor that John Longstaff
might come this way till the war-clouds had
rolled by. But our big portrait painter tells
his chum Minns that he has revoked and
stays in London.
Mrs. Minns, who is still on the other side,
was lately asked to explain a narrow chink of
light in her English window. Somehow—
perhaps the blind galloped up as spring-
blinds sometimes will —her domicile wasn’t
entirely blotted out in darkness. Hence the
official demand. We can’t realise what it
means to be the lady field-marshal in charge
of window-blinds when Zeps. are dropping
their souvenirs.
The Light Horse carnivals began on
Friday evening at the Stadium and finished
like a Chinese play on the following after-
noon. Col. Bob Lenehan and “Snowy” Baker
were the hon. organisers of both events.
There’s a chance of £2OOO falling into the
Comforts Fund as the result.
Saturday afternoon’s effort in the Agri-
cultural Grounds ran the usual gamut of
outdoor contests. In fact, when the after-
noon rush filled the show-ring, spectators had
to try to look both ways at once—as they
used to tell us to do in tramcar instructions.
H. M. Somer trotted among the ring events
on his cobby white pony while Roman
chariots fled round the track. A fleeting
vision of Iloratius Woollalira’s white toga
whipping the air while the red robe of
Spurius Lartius Camperdown pushed past
was loudly cheered. Farrier-sergeant Fitz-
simons rode a tandem team which ought to
have gone over the hurdles, but mostly
rounded them, the leader obstinately sidling
off from the timber. In the official stand
<”11101 Secretary Black and his wife, little
Mrs. Lenehan and what’s left of her tall
family, and Mrs. Playfair and son .Tack were
amongst the party. Lieut. Jack, twice
severely wounded at Gallipoli, now feels
nearly as well as ever, and hopes to get back
to the guns (he’s an artilleryman) before the
year is much older.
The rain fell heavily on the wedding of
blue-eyed Etta Norris and Dr. Nicholas
Larkins, but it didn’t damp the spirits of
the hero and heroine. The bride’s golden
locks gleamed through an embroidered veil
held in place by a wreath of orange blos-
som. The bridal finery was snow white,
without the conventional blush of pale pink
which has been rather rushed of late.
Lawyer Osborne Norris handed his sister
over to her young man, who hangs his sign
out in Marrickville. Bridesmaiden Frances
Barry added the usual touch of pink to the
occasion. The cake was cut at the Went-
worth over the way.
The other day an Australian artilleryman
in Egypt met Colonel Smith, of the British
R.A. The latter was the huge Imperial
officer who was lent to N. S. Wales just
before the Boer war. When the tlien-
famous A Battery left here for S’Africa
long Smith (he was Gft. 4in. and a heavy-
weight besides) went in command. After
these years the former subaltern met his old
boss beside the Nile, where he is now in a big
artillery job. This Smith’s the man, by the
way, who had a rather famous squabble
with the inexperienced Beauchamp at a
Government House ball. The youthful
Seidlitz Power potentate sent an equally-
young A.D.C. across the room to tell Colonel
Smith to remove his sword in the presence
of vice-royalty. The big Englishman, in full
warpaint, sent an unofficial reply that he
would see his Ex. “somewhere” first. Then
he clattered out and never returned.
The local Society for the Prevention of
Too Much English plunges irregularly into
French conversation at the Girls’ High
School. The next address by Consul Chayet
is to be about Erzerum and adjacent coun-
try. When the French Consul gets the com-
pany out of its depth the best students fling
lifebuoys to the drowning.
Captain Eric Sudeley Unwin, a son of
the late Harry Unwin, who A.D.C.’d to
Governor Loftus, far back in pre-
Federal days, and who married a daughter
of the Captain Hendy Pooleys, of South
Head, has just acquired the Military Cross.
The ex-Svdney lad, who is only 22, and who
put in some of his school days at our Scots’
College, holds his commission in the British
Army Service Corps. The decoration came
for special transport service in Flanders. A
younger brother wears the brass finishings
of the Royal Marines.
David Barker, a Sydney artist with some
extra knowledge gained in the U.S.A., is
attached to the Fifth Field Ambulance on
active service; but he is back in his old
line for a while, busy illustrating the Anzac
Magazine, which is to come this way soon.
In a competition for the colored cover his
design came out best, and he has been loaned
to the staff until the new work is well in
hand. Patrons of art will remember his
delicate monotypes at the Society of Artists’
show a year or so ago.
The tall Cliff Penny, who has had most
of the big criminal advocacy in Westralia
for some years, was admitted to the N.S.W.
Bar three hours after landing in Sydney one
day last week.
George Marlow lent the New Adelphi to a
North Sydney band of amateur mummers the
other afternoon. The company produced
“The Private Secretary” in aid of the Nurse
Cavell Memorial Home, and a good house,
sprinkled with khaki, witnessed the old
comedy. G. H. Jamieson as Cattermole, the
peppery old uncle from India, attacked the
part with arms and legs, and gave (inciden-
tally) a physical-culture display. The auc-
tion of sweets, flowers, etc., by Frances Ross
went very well, considering the endless oppor-
tunities there are of paying 10s. for a posy.
Frances, in the latest cut of black-silk frock,
very wide at the hem, also auctioned a side-
line in filmy-silk camisoles. The auction-
eeress called them blouses. But the men
knew better, and their spirited bidding for
the dainty rags was the surprise of the
matinee. The Cremorne branch of the Red
Cross was in charge of the treasury.
That scintillating musical trio, Leo, Jan
and Mischel Cherniavsky, were recently
“commanded” to play before the Connaughts
iu Canada’s snowy Government House. There
were no strangers present at this intimate
performance. Princess Patricia (she doesn’t
have to work for a crust), with the help of
Dick Nevill, assisted at the teapot after the
event.. Royalty prefers its classic music in
homoeopathic doses. This tabloid concert
lasted for half an hour on a winter after-
noon. After munching the vice-regal muffin
and receiving the thanks of the Connaughts
(who seem to be kindly, homely folks), the
Russian triplet pulled on their snowshoes
and dashed off to another engagement.
The first crop of Gonservatorium scholar-
ships includes Vera Bedford, a daughter of
the versatile Randolph. Verbrugghen ex-
pects the clever girl to go far along the line
which she has taken —composition. Little
Mirrie Solomon gets a similar token of
esteem.
The Easter Show is going to be a happy
hunting-ground for war-fund bandits. The
Old Gold and Silver committee has already
pegged out the site for a branch fastness.
Its chief hiding-place is in City Mutual
Chambers, Hunter-street.
The band given by Eadith Walker still
cheers tlm 3rd Battalion on its way. Where
that way is I can’t tell you, because I don’t
know. Meanwhile the battalion’s Comforts
Fund has bespoken Colonel Bob Owen and
his elegant lady (she looks like a slender
figure out of a Watteau picture) for March
18. It is to be a gift afternoon < for the
troops and a welcome to the 3rd’s chief.
Colonel Bob. Mrs. D. 11. Souter is in
charge of the depot, 124 Oxford-street.
Sydney’s Anglican Dean Talbot is back
home. While piloting in Gallipoli trenches
he got a taste of Screaming Jane, or some
such missile. But he’s well again, thank
you. By way of barter, we sent the Arch-
bish. off," but only to Hobart. Did you ever
go a-sailing with an archbish.? If you did
I’m sure you pitied the poor man for the
times he had to change his clothes. In the
morning it’s a good, comfortable sac suit
for a game of quoits. Just before lunch the
sac coat springs into something that sweeps
half-way to the knee. By four o’clock the
knee is obliterated. Then having given his
top end attention he begins to peel up from
the ankles, and for dinner you have a most
reverend father in gaiters. The voyage over,
he motors home for a rest.
Florence Rodway has made a faithful like-
ness in pastel of John Lemmone. The tones
are'in warm, snuff brown. John’s forelock
lies in an artistic tangle—as in life—and
the portrait is one of the artist’s best. Melba
ordered it for the Coombe Cottage collection.
Miss Elsie Simpson, a visitor from Colum-
bia University, is a tall, nice-looking young
woman with a glittering set of her own white
teeth. She specialises in economics, and is
enjoying this hobby in Sydney ’Varsity as
understudy or Lady Plelp to Professor Irv-
ing. The youngsters’ welfare exhibition, in
May, is to have her to help Miss Dumolo in
the organising.
Dr. Elsie Dalzell, the Sydney woman who
lately struggled with the enteric outbreak in
Servia, is now working at an English mili-
tary hospital. She had some thrilling ex-
periences with the deadly typhus germ at
Uskub, in Peter’s kingdom.
One of the few things the N.S.W. Red
Cross didn’t send (or sent too little of) was
grease-proof paper. The French in snowy
Salonika and adjacent parts had plenty of
this cheap luxury, and they kept Jacky
Frost away from their toes in consequence.
Mrs. Spencer Brunton is on her way home
to Sydney. She lent her impressive presence
to the wedding of daughter Jean at St.
Paul’s, Knightsbridge, the other week. The
’groom, Captain Adrian Moreing, of the City
of London Regiment, met his fair-haired lass
some time ago, and the affair came to a
climax (with one bridesmaid) on January
11. Charles Marsden, an uncle by marriage,
gave the tall bride to her new husband.
Australian sculptor Web Gilbert seems to
have achieved a faithful, unflattering like-
ness of George Reid. The photo, of this
marble bust emphasises our late Commission-
er’s multiple chin and other well-known
tubby characteristics.
A Cairo gossip mentions Sheila Chisholm’s
wedding to Lord Loughborough, heir to the
Earl of Rosslyn. Sheila, who was much
given to cream tailor-built outfits in her
recent debutante days, wore a coat and skirt
in this elusive shade; and her big, black,
velvet eyes were matched by a hat en suite.
Edith Fry, formerly of Manly, has settled
down in Paris. She pursued Art till the war
almost smashed the palette trade. These days
she’s hon. sec. of the Students’ Club in tile
Latin Quarter —now almost as fiercely re-
spectable as Petersham at four o’clock on a
Sunday afternoon. Miss Fry’s job is to help
artists who haven’t one.
Another of the Fry sisters. Mildred, M.A.,
now Mrs. Muscio, returns this way for about
nine months. She married the Cambridge
man last year. Research work is his hobby,
but lie takes Prof. Anderson’s chair of Logic
for a crust. Only as locum tenens, though.
Artist Joe Wolinski has been showing his
wares in Noo Yark. What the ’Murkau
press said of the versatile Hebrew’s work is
like the sound of a great amen to the Aus-
tralian criticism. The Sydney man seemed
to slash paint on canvas according to the
color of his mood. Hence it varied from
good to bad, from indifferent to worse. A
first-rate sample of his best, “After Life’s
Fitful Fever,” hangs in our National Gal-
lery. When the chameleon-like preferences
of the genial artist aren’t glued to paint
they mostly digress to vocal gymnastics.
Do you remember George Treloar, who
used to be in the burly Asche’s company? He
gave up grease-paint to train with the
Artists’ Rifles. Now the news comes that
lie’s a second lootenant in the haughty Cold-
stream Guards. His lot are in Flanders.
Young Leake, a son of Billyard, has been
transferred from the Australia to the War-
spite. He is a lieutenant in the R.A.N.
Phyllis, the pretty daughter of the L. A.
Fosberys, of Wagga, said she would to her
Lieut. S. L. Edmunds early in the month.
The soldier belongs to the Light Horse jt p »_
a son of the late W. H. Edmunds, of MoW
and leaves for the Big Fight shortly. g ’
An Australian nurse sends a cooee from
Salonika: We had a howling gale as our
lullaby with snow as the finish of 0 ,,
voyage. The town looked like an iced wed
ding-cake, the old Turkish parts with their
watch-towers serving as the decorations
Tall, white minarets like long marble fin'
gers pointed to a clearing sky Close it
is not so fine, being very dirty in the ’old
Eastern style The French soldiers here
look very smart in military fur coats, and
there’s usually a sword somewhere ’ con-
cealed about their warmly-clad persons. The
small Greek soldiers reminded us of the
days when we sat at the footstool of Gilbert
and Sullivan. Though many of them were in
khaki it was differently served up to our
uniforms. The tassels that floated from
their caps hung over their left shoulder. As
for the jumble of women—think of a world
pantomime with a chorus dressed in even-
fashion except Eve’s figleaves!”
Socks and pyjama ladies have blossomed
into smiles under the recent Mountain rail-
wav concession scheme. The cheap monthly
“season” has brought the roses back to the
cheeks of busy depot dames, who come to
town on their official days with a yard or
two of socks in their arms. Even the strenu-
ous Mrs. David’s gossamer floats along
Woodford station as she dashes into the
early train. The Railway Commissioner is
the idol of the moment.
The sth Field Artillery Comforts dames
send S.O.S. signals for 1000 (or more)
pairs of socks. Champion knitters like the
Chisholm sisters have still another chance to
show their prowess. By way of goading the
workers to action the secretary mentions
another competition. Entries should reach
the depot (Carrington-street, Wynyard
Square) by March 30.
Some of these comforts committees are
going to find their skeins tangled presently,
because a reorganisation of the forces is
proceeding in Egypt, and the man who was
in the Fifth Brigade yesterday is liable to
find himself in the Fourteenth to-morrow.
It will take weeks to sort things out, especi-
ally as only fragmentary news of changes
and transfers and re-enumerations has come
by cable.
Will some squatter, alone or in company,
do a Great and Kind Deed? The girls working
for the 17th Battalion are desperately in
need of a bale of scoured wool. They could
card and spin it themselves, and of course
sock knitting for the soldiers follows. I’ll
promise the squatter donating the wool good
luck, and he won’t have to wait for the Here-
after to get it.
There is to be a unique moonlight concert
for the War Chest Fund at Mrs. T. Ashley’s
picturesque home, Fernleigh—the Rose Bay
place Melba rented a few years ago—on
March 22.
Did you notice that Captain Cecil Cropper
—a Sydney ’Varsity man—now wears the
Military Cross? He’s a brother of the A.J.C.
secretary.
Women typists and clerks are rolling up
their sleeves to take on spare-time work.
Greatly daring, they call their new organi-
sation The Clerical Women’s Patriotic Club.
There is already a Women’s Club with a
patriotic flag, so there may be trouble over
the name. The infant (it’s about a fortnight
old) proposes to go into action in the manner
of the Voluntary Workers.
Lancelot Harrison, B.Sc., and his little
Amy. are home again (it’s, “home” for a
couple of years) in Cambridge. They had
the dissipation of Christmas in London.
Amy (Mack, she was) is still pegging away
at children’s stories, and hubby searches for
bacteria in the old ’Varsity laboratories.
She’s a sister of Louise.
Mosman surgeon Phipps, who left nearly
a year back with the A.M.C., supporting
the crown of a major, reports “all well” in
Egypt. He may be addressed as Lieutenant-
Colonel from now on.
The fete for the Passionist Fathers is com-
ing to a head. A committee meeting in the
Town Hall this week will round-up any
stragglers.
The Army Service Corps (No. 2) has set
aside St. Pat’s Day for a fresh attack on the
public. “Rose Day” they call it. The War
Chest goes privateering on the same occasion.
Mrs. Lyster Ormsby, a recent bride whose
husband is in training for the battle zone,
is taking hold of a new centre at Paddington
to assist soldiers’ wives and mothers. Ynys
Ormsby, as hon. organiser, brings a stack of
experience recently acquired in a French
canteen to bear on the practical details of
the experiment.
After flirting with the millinery trade in
Melbourne, Grace Palotta has decided to
overlook a hat shop in this vale of tears.
Yours affectionately,
VANDORIAN.

MELBOURNE CHATTER
Melbourne, March 13, 1916.
My Dear Yarrie, —
On Saturday afternoon, March 18, by
courtesy of the vice-regal Fergusons, Govern-
ment House and grounds will be filled with
frenzy and small change. French wounded
soldiers and their families will benefit. The
daylight show will begin at 2.30, with Mrs.
Crevelli as organiser. “As You Like It”
will be played in the garden by George Mar-
low’s Shakspearian co., while Clement May
is impersonating Dickens characters in the
kitchen; and when the Kennedy Quartet
get busy on the roof, Napoleon Boffard will
start to sing like a plump lark in the draw-
ing-room. The admission fee is 10s., so
you can rely on not meeting any washerladies
there. No sensible member of the craft will
squander half a sovereign on such a show
when she can see real kings for thrippence
at the pictures.
The Quamby Club is going to indulge in
a bazaar for the benefit of the Wounded
Soldiers’ Club. The Bridges lady will open
the show on Friday, 24th, at 8 o’clock, and
it will rage again on Saturday until mid-
night.
When Sheila Chisholm, of Sydney, married
the Loughborough lordling, “the last man to
step off Anzac” made the bride a present of
a mellow-toned dinner-gong that stood elbow-
higli, saying meanwhile: “You can have an
inscription put on this. It was the last shell
fired at Anzac.” Sheila at once flopped
down and kissed the battle-trophy.
That keen, courteous, extensive British
officer who came to Australia as Captain
Mackworth, D. 5.0., a few years ago, to
teach us the finer points of army signalling,
is now a colonel at Cairo, and learning to
be a general. Mackworth’s Mrs. —the late
Professor Franklin Peterson’s girl Leonie,
who first saw Australia as a six-year-old—
is keeping him company until headquarters
are moved to Constantinople.
Maurice Craweour, a cousin of the Craw-
cour lad who was shot dead at Williams-
town many years ago during a struggle with
burglars, is back in Melbourne after a long
stay in hospital at Cairo. Young Craweour
lived in Belgium, but the sandbags of Gal-
lipoli looked better to him than the sugarbags
of the C.S.R. Co., so he joyfully threw
down his typewriter and was gone. Now,
he is at the Base Hospital, continuing to re-
cover from his numerous wounds.
Amesfield Park, the amateur farm of Major
Charles Campbell, is going to the hammer
while its owner goes to the Hun. For
many years Campbell had ornamented Mel-
bourne “society” ; then he bought 300 acres
of farm land by the sea at Mornington, with
a good slice of beach and other comforts,
and proceeded to sink into retirement as a
horny-handed toiler. Now and again he
bobbed up—once by having a spectacular
bolt down the cliff road with a team, a
waggon and an incalculable quantity of
potatoes. Campbell had the price of a crust
and a motor-car and an Axminster over and
above his earnings as a farmer; but he
tilled the soil with some success, and last
season broke into a pleasant perspiration
over the harvesting of 180 acres of hay-crop.
A matron sends an extract from a letter
written by her daughter, who is nursing at
Heliopolis. She asks that it be published,
not for the glorification of The Bulletin
(“I dislike the paper”), but as a hint for
purchasers of the journal to send along their
well-thumbed copies to the Ist Australian
General Hospital, Heliopolis. Thus writes
nurse:—•
Do send The Bulletin —every man wapts it.
The Australasian comes a bad second. I just have to
claim those you send as mine, and lend them with
the proviso that they are returned to me, so that I
let each copy circulate. The poor fellows just
love The “Bully,” as they call it. It may be bad
taste (?), but the fact remains.
The reference to bad taste suggests that
mamma had written of the paper with dis-
approbation whilst she was mailing it. The
nurse, judging from her note of interroga-
tion, begins to side with the boys.
Talking of this hospital, the wife
of Colonel Summons came back to Mel-
bourne by the Mongolia recently. Lots of
sick and wounded boys who have returned
from Egypt will remember her kindness to
them.
Probably the worst-spelt soldier in the
A.I.F. is Lieut.-Colonel McNicoll, D. 5.0.,
a Geelong man who is at present in Victoria
on furlough after a tough time in hospital.
One Melbourne paper rendered him as
McNicoll, McNichol and McNicol in the
same paragraph, and another added
Macnichol to the list of casualties. McNicoll
received his wound at Cape Helles, and for a
brigade-commander is a very young person
indeed.
The V.R.C. Autumn meeting is over, and
betting men are trying to persuade them
selves that they are done with the game.
There was a good crowd on Saturday for
the last gallops. Quite half the men were
in khaki, and droves of them wore the
shoulder colors of battalions that have been
under fire. The Y.R.C. authorities felt all
right about it, because the gate money and
nomination fees were going to swell the
patriotic funds. The band from Broad-
meadows camp took the lawn at their ease
and were entertained at lunch. They played
in distant parts of the course and passed the
hat with complete success. Recruiting offi-
cers enjoyed the racing when they weren’t
prowling round in search of recruits, and
500 legionaries did an exhibition march just
to hearten up the young-men onlookers.
After a week of sunny days the women-
folk put away their furs and came out with
light dresses and lovely parasols. Mrs.
Leslie Macdonald looked magnificent. Striped
black flimsy material flared round her
statuesque figure with a top dressing of
braid-bound velvet and a very complicated
hat. Mrs. Leslie Stuart, in navy blue, flew
a large-sized rooster’s tail over a white straw
helmet. Squattress Wilson resembled a
court card in clothes which looked as if
they had been painted on to her. Jess Fair-
bairn, in the committee pen with her father,
wore a crushed strawberry-colored leather
hat. “Baby” Fairbairn (a healthy, well-
grown girl who has put her hair up and
lengthened her dresses) wore a frilly lace
bonnet and a coon-striped dress. Wild
wings and bows in hats being fashionable,
the smart Fenner girl supported a blue and
yellow parrot. Mrs. Geoffrey Syme wore a
saucy tailor-made, of which the long coat
was military-looking and fur-edged. The
Charlie Wallaces came down from their
sheep studio, Mrs. Charlie in white cloth.
Mrs. Cecil Fisken took the lawn in flared
velvet. The Adelaide Hawkers scored the
last win of the day with Tringa. The Wil-
liam Cooper knight wore a sad, philosophical
air; his expensive English horse Redfern
was out of things from the first day. Sam
McCaughey watched some of the racing, and
Stephen Brunton, over from Sydney, was a
very interested party in the birdcage. Dr.
Kenna and his wife also looked in on their
way home from the Apple Island. The
Stewart Menzies, visiting from the U.S.,
partied with Miss Gordon, of Sydney.
But the most noticeable costumes of all
were worn by batches of head milliners and
dressmakers. Ordinary females who merely
pay these people to clothe them are not
allowed to acquire the extra-special lunacies,
which are carefully reserved for themselves
by the rag priestesses.
Adelaide presents her report and balance-
sheet
Miss Merle Robertson, our newest Elder scholar,
was farewelled at The Acacias the other evening,
with Edwin Smith and Mrs. George Dean as host
and hostess respectively. A brief concert occurred
in the ballroom, and Merle’s brother, Clara Serena
and Eugene Alderman all contributed.
Colonel Dean, who was invalided from Gallipoli
to England with enteric, is now in Egypt, where
three of his sons are also serving.
The Galway dame is back at Government House
after a salted interlude at Victor Harbor. Her son,
who is with the R.F.A., is in hospital at Havre, and
a nephew, Lieut. R. F. d’Erlanger, now wears the
Military Cross.
The eldest of the Herbert Phillips daughters is
engaged to Lieut. Harold Greenway, a son of the
Thomas Greenways, of Melbourne.
Nora Kyffin Thomas and Eugene Alderman are
organising a concert for the end of the month in
the Queen’s Hall—proceeds to go to that common-
sense institution, the School for Mothers.
Josiah Symon’s eldest son, Charles, has cabled
that he has got a commission in the Coldstream
Guards. He left here in September last.
The Wattle Day League Ambulance Fund annexed
the proceeds of the Terrier Club Championship
Show. An art union, afternoon tea and cake and
sweet stalls helped to bring in silver.
The war is making a mess of things. The Adel-
aide Club now gets its refreshments from waitresses,
and has to look all round before it tells a smoking-
room story.
Mrs. C. H. Angas is homeward-bound from Eng-
land with her second son, who has six months' sick-
leave to spend after serving in the South-West
African campaign.
Marble Hill —the vice-regal residence in the Hills
—has been offered to the Defence Department as a
hospital, and as it is something under 15 miles
from Adelaide it should be easily workable as a con-
valescent home. A request was made for the Old
Folks’ Homes at Magill, but that the Government
would not listen to.
The handy sum of £2250 has been given to the
Government by Mr. A. M. Simpson for the purchase
of an armed biplane.
A “Patriotic” dinner party, conveniently
timed for race week, was engineered by Lesly
Madden at Menzies’, which august hostelry
was turned upside down to find accommoda-
tion for 400 extra diners at 10s. per patriotic
mouth. Dames who are taking this year seri-
ously wanted to know why dear Lesly chose
Ash Wednesday and the first day of Lent for
the gorge. _ Some went along and chloro-
formed their consciences by feeding on Spar-
tan fare. Several stout heroines warned the
waiters in this fashion: “Only chicken and
asparagus, please. No wine!” The rou-
lette table, with Lesly herself in charge, was
the centre of the whirlpool. The lady-attenda,nt
paid out four or five shillings on a spin,
and raked in dozens more for the good. cause,
which is to provide food and entertainment
for returned wounded. Dr. Ivenna and his
wife were two Sydneysiders in the crowd.
Racing-man Clarke and one of the Baillieus
partied with the Leslie Stuarts at the flag
table.
Mrs. Jack Sternberg gave a race-week
party at the Grand. It all happened in the
large drawing-room and adjoining balconies,
where the Weedon dame arrived in very
fetching white cloth, while squattress Whitty
made every head in the room revolve with
her striped skirt and flaring navy-blue glac6
coat. Mrs. Croker was in cinnamon brown
and the frills of her daughter were attached
to white tailorings. The Pharez Phillips
widow, in deep black weeds, congratulated
herself that she is not really losing daughter
Thelma on her marriage next month to Mr.
Davies, of Maoriland. He is finding a flat
in St. Kilda-road for the nest. Daughter
Thelma, in khaki and a smart little new
bonnet, looked very charming. Mrs. Alex.
Sternburg supported waves of brown dress
material. Mrs. Hodgkinson wore the all-
too-frequent black. Most of the women
guests had come on from work-and-talk
meetings. The big French thanksgiving
had been crowded to overflowing, and the
escapees joyfully rushed their tea after
enduring the crush. The league for squelch-
ing German trade at the shop counter with
a sniff, instead of frightening it away with
a high tariff, was another dry show that
had given some a long thirst. The ladies
discussed their nice little half-crown racing
bets and agreed that they did not really
want to go to the races, but yielded to the
entreaties of their sporting husbands. We
all know how keen racing men are on taking
their womenfolk along. A busy sport with-
out his wife never really enjoys himself.
You just ask him —but do it when the lady
isn’t there.
The Archie Curries gave a special feast
for some of their race-time visitors, and
the Chirnside dame did likewise. The
Cyrus Barlows and son took nourishment
exclusively at a small station next the
Chirnsiding, while the rushing waiters, with
the bright scarlet of the Menzies tartan on
their coat-lapels, looked like very humble
and unnaturally useful genthelps.
Coal-duke John Brown has been putting
up at Menzies’ and giving discreet little
dinner parties, with a grey-haired chaperone
to do the coffee-ordering in the lounge.
A sweet little bride from Adelaide put up
at Menzies’ with her husband during the
earlier race days ; but as he belonged first of
all to the Navy, and the Navy wanted him,
he had to hurry on to Sydney. Her maiden
name was Low; I won’t be able to tell you
her married name until I post my social
ledger for the month.
Harry Osborne, who married into the
Madden family, came over for the races
without his wife. Theo Marks was also a
grass-widower at Flemington. Mrs. Theo
went through Melbourne on her way to
Colombo, but did not trouble to unpack her
trunks for the races. The Cameron widow,
who was also bound for Colombo, put up at
the Oriental while the mailboat smoked a
quiet pipe or two at Port Melbourne. The
fascinating lady made the carefully-uphol-
stered guests greenly envious with some of
her gowns. One night she stopped the soup
on its rounds with a white glory that starred
out to points like a she-clown’s costume. The
white satin slippers that flashed under the
skirt-hem were exquisite trifles. It wouldn’t
be sensible to wear busted Jemima boots with
a dream of that sort.
At the Menzies patriotic dinner Mrs.
Benjamin hostessed an Allies’ table, round
which all the Entente consuls were fed.
The Sydney race visitors were saddened
by the news of Harley Mackenzie’s death.
The popular solicitor was usually one of the
Menzies’ party in merrier times.
The Boyd clan is mourning the death of
Dr. Hugh, who was killed by his own motor
m Bendigo. He was the father of many
daughters and two sons. Both of the boys
are on active service abroad. Yenora, the
picturesque eldest daughter, is a good pianist
and lives these days in the U.S.A. Several of
the others are in Bananaland, while Calma,
the youngest, inks a pen on a local daily.
All the flags in Prahran were half-mast last
I riday. The death of Mrs. Rupert Nichol-
son, a former mayoress, brought them down
Her home in Punt-road, South Yarra, was
always a haven for the destitute, and her
days were spent in charitable doings.
On Ash Wednesday N.S.W. squatter
Hunter 1 aterson find Madge, the youngest
of the Finch Noyes family, got married in
the bcotchbyterian kirk. Captain Alex.
Noyes, who is just back from Egypt, handed
his sister oyer at the rails. The two elder
Noyes daughters are Landales now.
Dr. Schlesinger’s widow has taken another
lease of matrimony. She was last week
wedded to Arthur Sprague, an over-the-M„r
ray squatter, at Christ Church, South Yarr
and the event was most fashionably “quiet’’’
Mrs. George Stewart and daughter Aimip
are back from the smells and
Egypt. The daughter is wearing a dreamv
smile and half-hoop ring on account of TV
Talbot Hamilton. They met on the out'
ward voyage, Talbot, who partnered Dr
Perry, of Hawksburn, being bound for a
job in a military hospital. Generally speak
ing the war is a bad thing for Cupid; never
theless it brings him a certain amount of
new business.
War-lecturer Coleman is as fat as butter
and his pocket-embossed khaki costume
stands out like a ballet dress. He talks to
his Australian audience in the United States
language, and some of my fellow-townsmen
who don’t read much U.S. literature can
hardly follow him. Occasionally he emits a
deep “Ooh, my friends!” and everybody
thinks a warning about the hereafter will
follow. I think there must be preachers in
the family. But he has some vivid stories
to tell. He was attached, more or less to
the headquarters staff and had to keep in
touch with a British general with a motor-
car. He found it hard (despite broad
ditches and thick walls) to keep out of touch
with the oncoming enemy, and he had to
leave several good autos, behind him. Once
from the top of a wall he watched through
his glasses a magnificent charge and clash
between English and German cavalry. The
English horsemen won the tournament,
which was conducted in the old heroic man-
ner. The weak side of the show is the
rather dim pictures. The blood-crazed Hun
could not be induced to stand still and look
pleasant.
The Albert-street Conservatorium is gloat-
ing over a 20-page letter from Melba, writ-
ten just as she was boarding the train for
California. After exhausting the dictionary
of adjectives about the success of her recent
opera performance, the thrush launched into
an epic upon “the joy of returning home”
in the most thrilling capital letters. All
the students at Albert-street are busy with
voice lozenges, so that every larynx will be
bright and shining in readiness for the first
Melba lesson.
According to the latest from London,
Billy Murdoch, the pianist—as he has lately
acquired a wife perhaps he might be called
William —is “going up like smoke.” He has
been performing at a Queen’s Hall Symphony
Concert, doing a bit with conductor Beecham
and supporting Clara Butt —only pianisti
cally of course.
Nellie Billings has come back after assist-
ing Miss May Brookes to give concerts for
the sick and wounded in Egypt. She has
played the piano along with all sorts of nota-
bles —even with the Prince of Battenberg.
She is also quite ready to write a thesis upon
“Music as it is Playing in the East.” Accord-
ing to Miss Billings, the natives perform at
funerals and weddings with equal merriment,
and they are always in too much of a hurry
to trouble to finish a tune on the right note.
Singer Elsie Davies, who gave her first
Australian concert the other evening after an
absence of 10 crowded years in Europe, was
the pioneer singing exhibitioner at the Uni.
Conservatorium when that concern shifted
uncomfortably from Albert-street to the old
museum building west of the frog-pond in
the University grounds. When the move
was made, William Laver (now Ormond
Professor) was vice-director of the Uni.
establishment, pending the arrival from
abrawd of the new professor, the late Frank-
lin Peterson; and it was Laver’s prompt
recognition of the budding Davies talent that
presently led to her becoming the Uni.’s star
singing student of those days.
While the Pankhurst women are busy re-
making the world with their little hatchets,
their male cousin, Frank Hayes, has been
devoting himself to the ladylike job of get-
ting out a Beauty Book entitled “The
Secrets of the Toilet” —in gold, on powder-
blue. The pretty thing gives away secrets
wrested from the cleverest women in the
game. The tremendous problem of make-up
is discussed all round the clock, and wise
girls are counselled never to wear a red
nose with a blue hat. Nothing is left unre-
vealed about the beauty uses of massage,
hair washes, and manicure and eyebrow
farming. The whole mass of disclosures is
to be had for a shilling; and after the male
cynic has skipped through it he will be able
to go out and sneer at the world of women.
Incidentally, some of the prettiest girls in
town are selling the valuable work of refer-
ence.
Yours sincerely,
JOHANNA.

ABORIGIN
ALITIES
“Snell” : As demonstrating the spread of
the bunyip myth in Australia, at Coop-Coop, a cow
country near the Goulburn (Vic.), they had quite an
excitement recently over a new monster that appeared
in the river. Its appearances had been numerous if
fleeting, and there were many credible witnesses, in-
cluding a clergyman and a J.P., also several mem-
bers of the local Rechabite tent, as well as seasoned
vendors of fish stories. The monster was variously
described. The reverend witness thought it rather
resembled a mermaid, and the police constable in-
clined to the belief that it was a swimming pig with
a tail like a cod’s. But public opinion fastened on
the belief that the thing was a bunyip, and Coop-
Coop was preparing itself for the renown that would
accrue through the possession of the first duly-accred-
ited and officially-verified representative of the tribe.
Then a local fisherman captured a giant cod with his
head pushed through a hole in the bottom of an old
iron bucket. The cod had his cap-piece through from
the inside and there were indications that he had
been wearing that bucket as a cape for a considerable
tiinfe. - Coop-Coop is restored to its old contempt for
bunyips.
A CONSOLING REFLECTION.
TTHE BRIDE TO-BE : “My only worry is about mother. She's bound to miss me terribly.”
FRIEND OF THE FAMILY : “Ah, well, she can't complain. After all, she's had you longer
than most mothers keep their daughters."
“Billy T.” : I remember the afternoon they
brought Tom Rogan across the paddock from the
Prince Albert, where they were coping with the blue-
stone. Four men were carrying Tom on a litter
made of a boiler-house door, and they walked with
measured steps and slow, Coleman, the boss, coming
a few steps ahead as if it were a funeral. They
placed Tom on the “colonial sofa” in our front
room, and peeping in at the door we kids saw that
his face was very white, saving for the red streak
drifting from a cut in his head. Something had
fallen on Tom and dented him badly. Mother did
his head up very neatly in long strips of clean linen,
and then put a cloth, wet with vinegar and water,
over all, and Tom was left there while the men went
across the paddock to find a doctor at Yarramen.
Mother went softly about her work, and we kids had
to sit still and hold our row. Presently Tom Rogan,
pale and gory, with a boot in his right hand, came
staggering down the passage and into the kitchen.
He blinked like a magpie in candlelight, and then
put up a yell. “Hell t’ yer soul, Norah Rogan!”
he cried. “Ain’t me supper ready yet?” and he
hulled the boot and knocked mother over a chair.
Then Tom Rogan toppled down again, and lay very
still on the kitchen floor. “Poor man !” said mother,
looking down at him and rubbing the bruise on her
neck. “ ’Twas just force of habit.”
* * * *
“Burdekin” : Let me explain how to cure
snakebite. First, keep cool. Round up your sang-
froid, and touch not spirits. Two punctures need a
quick offensive. Tie a ligature—-string, lace or
wire. Pinch the bitten part, and cut out the punc-
tures. Failing a knife, scarify deeply with a nail
or barbed wire. As a last resource, bite the place
(unless it is at the back of your neck, when it is
just as well to let somebody else bite it).
Grind a few grains of Condy’s crystals, and rub
them in. (If you have no crystals with you write
to Rockhampton for them.) They will destroy their
own weight of snake venom. Light up and have a
smoke. In 15 minutes slack away the ligature for
one minute. Tighten again for half an hour, then
discard permanently. Shake hands with yourself and
have a camp.
* * * *
“Quandong”: Re “Barcoo” and ‘his new
discovery of electric-motor-driyen sheep-shearing
machines, I would like to know what make of gear
he swung on to. I warrant it was not one of the
two makers on the market generally installed (as
a wool hawk he will know the makers I refer to).
I have used them both and could not get pace nor
cool running. On a cold morning they fuse out
as fast as the electrician can keep going. Thirty of
us at one shed concluded to do away with electric
gear altogether, as our tallies individually were from
20 to 30 sheep a day slower than by steam in what
we .considered the same class of sheep.
The old Maori warriors are fast fading
away. This time the wake was over Awarua, of
Taranaki, who fought against the pakeha at Otapawa,
Te Ngutu-o-te-Manu, Turuturu-Mokai, Taurangaika,
Nkumaru and in many other scraps. Awarua’s ability
to dodge trouble was long sustained, as he kept out
of the way of the black canoe for something near a
century. When he was dead a mean advantage
was taken of this grim old fighting man. Someone
arrived with a set of bagpipes and made horrible
noises over the patriot’s grave.
THE EARLY DIPLOMAT.
TEACHER (appearing suddenly on reluctant scholar): “Now, Henry, I see you have been
in Mr. Smith's orchard. Did you get permission to help yourself to those
apples?"
HENRY: “Yes; please, me brother Bill's in askin' now."
“W.C.M.”: A friend of mine was much
concerned that his child seemed to be always tired
and listless in the morning and that while she slept
a sickly scent surrounded her. He consulted a doctor
who promptly inquired if the child slept near paw-
paw trees. She did; and the medico stated that the
trees were feeding on her, a property which they
had at night in common with the oleander and
magnolia. To prove his statement the doctor hung
up under a paw-paw tree a piece of raw meat.
Next day it had shrunk in size. The child was
moved to another outdoor sleeping place and there
was no further trouble.
* * * *
“Pick”: In what remote part does
“Barcoo” find the bullocky with the diminutive
leather thong, the Oxford drawl and four-abreast
team? Also, how does the gentleman yoke his four-
abreast procession, and whence do the tongue
bullocks get their pull? I have rounded most cor-
ners of N.S.W., especially during last shearing, and
the only pilots I met navigating overland ships
used the long-handled green-hide persuader, the
historic vocabulary and the long teams. Indeed, the
teams are gradually being made more elongated.
Owing to the dairying industry and smaller cattle
breeds, big steers have gone out of fashion, and
the bullocky has to make up in length what his
team lacks in weight. Where 18 was once a long
team, 22 and 24 are now common, and when they
were hauling a big 18-ton boiler into Croker’s Mint,
Shoalhaven gullies, some time ago, I saw a string of
56 acting as the motive power.
“Perri Stein”: Drink? Shearers! Nowa-
days the ink on their cheques ain’t dry before they’re
19 miles on the road to their next shed. They’ll
cadge a drink out of a bagman’s waterbag a mile
from a town so they won’t have to spend a bean.
If it’s their last shed they’ll tog-up—hair oil, collar
and all—and camp till they catch the train. No;
for fair, honest, straight up and down drinking give
me the sugar-squeezers, cane-choppers and all con-
nected with the great treacle industry. I’ve seen *7OO
hands roll into Mackay the first pay. Inside of an
hour you could have mustered the sober lot in a
jamtin. Guns and flats, rooks and toilers were all
paralytic. The streets were rocking and the lamp-
posts doing a cakewalk. The Johns? As long as
you left some of the town standing and didn’t mur-
der with violence you were all right. That mob
used to drink beer, eat beer, think beer and
nothing else. Drink! My oath!
“Boronia”: “Barcoo” (B. 6/1/16) is
quite right about the sudden and deadly effect of the
“heart leaf” poison plant. There are large areas
cursed with this vegetable some distance from
Bridgetown (W.A.)j in an easterly and south-easterly
direction. Invariably it give#a speedy and painful
death to sheep, but rarely kills horses and cattle
unless they have a good blow out on it. The effect
of the weed on horses is very peculiar. They may
be running in a paddock and browsing on the stuff
for months without any bad results manifesting
themselves; but attempt to ride or drive them at a
•good pace and they fall like a shot rabbit. The
only hope of saving a nag then is to bleed it, prefer-
ably by cutting off the tips of the ears. The poison
affects the lungs principally, making the victims very
short-winded. Once a prad’s wind goes as the result
of this plant, it takes at least two years to repair
the damage.
A HURRIED TALE.
The constable grasped the escaped kangaroo by
the tail and induced it to “come quietly to
station. —News item.

“Beeritus”: At the old Teetulpa gold-
fields (S.A.) is an ancient battler who when he leases

Nervous Wreck Restored to Health

Sydney J. Broughton.
D. Co., 2nd Battalion,

December 8, 1915.
Mr. G. YV. Hean, Chemist.
Dear Sir, —At the landing at Gallipoli on April 25 I was one
of the many whose misfortune it was to be wounded, and
invalided home. I suffered intensely with shell fever, and
such a nervous wreck did I become that for several days I was
delirious. My recuperation was slow indeed, and it was not
until I started on Bean's Tonic Nerve Nuts that I experienced
any very decided improvement.
I am now so far recovered that I am hooked to return to
the firing line. As a restorative lam convinced there is
nothing better than Hean’s Tonic Nerve Nuts, and I mean to
take a supply away with me.
Yours faithfully,
Private SYDNEY J. BROUGHTON.

T>piir Sir I wish to convey to you my appreciation of your
two remedies, HEAN’S ESSENCE and HEAN’S TONIC
NFRYE NUTS, hoth of which I have used with excellent
results 1 returned to Sydney in December, suffering from a
persistent cough and shattered nerves, due to my wounds and
battlefield experiences.
First of all I used Hean’s Essence for the cough, which
quickly yielded to its healing influence. I was under medical
treatment for my wounds and nerves. Having derived so

A Wonderful
Offer—
The boot here illustrated is one you know well by sight—the
boot worn by members of the Expeditionary Forces. We are mak-
ing them in thousands to the order of the Government, who have
an inspector to examine and pass every pair before delivery is taken,
borne pairs, when finished, fail to pass him—not for any fault that
really affects their wear or comfort, but for such minute defects as
one boot being as little as one-eighth of an inch higher at the back
tnan the other; one slug being out of place; or the heel not being
sufficiently even to pass the spirit-level test.
Nothing else is wrong with the rejects.
They’re SOLID LEATHER THROUGHOUT,

In a Maoriland cemetery there is a stone
erected over the grave of a deceased miner, giving
the date of his death, etc., and with a space under-
neath. At the very bottom reads the following note:
“This space is reserved for the memorial notice of
, mate of the above, when he dies.”
* ♦ * *
“Tenaculum”: As one of the first to
discard the strychnine treatment of snakebite in favor
of potassium-permanganate, let me supplement the
remarks of “Tropicus.” (1) Ligate as tightly as the
subject can bear; (2) do not burn or cauterise—per-
fectly useless torture; (3) Scarify the bitten part
with half a dozen short cuts l-16th inch in depth
and crossing one another star-fashion ; (4) apply the
permanganate in a solution of not more than 2 per
cent.; (5) give alcohol only in nerve-bracing quan-
tity—not to intoxication point. The value of per-
manganate of potassium (K2-Mn2-08) lies in the fact
that it readily yields up its oxygen upon contact
with any organic substance, this oxygen forming with
the snake-virus an inert compound which has not
yet been chemically formulated. It may be addi-
tionally mentioned as curious that while the virus of
the colubrine snakes super-liquefies the blood, it is
coagulated by the poison of the viperines, represented
in Australia only by the deaf-adder —Acanthophis
antarctica.

“Flinderino”: Rabbit-trapping is not bad
at times, but it has its downs as well as its ups.
Early last year mate and self were trapping down
Gippsland way, and were on a good wicket. We
were camped alongside a permanent creek half a
mile from a Melbourne merchant’s country house.
My. mate Snowy, who is better looking than myself,
went up to the house one day to try and sell a
couple of hares and, incidentally, to borrow some
sugar and flour. Snowy’s fringe or his new leggings
captivated the young housekeeper, and she gave him
a shilling each for the hares, about a shilling’s-worth
of flour and enough sugar to last us a month. “A
real bonzer tart,” said Snowy. After that, every
hare we caught was taken up to the house, and we
always scored some scones or the remains of a meat
pie or lice custard. Also, every Monday we had
roast turkey or fowl. Then we took to run-
ning our washing up to the house, and our socks
always came back with the punctures mended. But
our luck fell down dead suddenly. One night we had
an extra-large catch—the best for months. It took
us an hour longer than usual to remove their grass-
baskets, etc. t When we caught the old ruin, loaded
up the crates and galloped to the station, we
arrived in time to see the guard’s-van disappear
through the gum-trees. Long before the next train
was timed to leave for Melbourne our fine catch
was too dead to be worth alluding to. It rained
hard nearly all the next week. For three days we
REASSURING.
“I hope, Maria, that you never speak outside
- of the quarrels I sometimes have with
your master.”
”Lor ’ bless ns! No, ma’am; but I alwiz
mentions when ye’re nice to each other!”
were unable to leave the tent, and had to live
entirely on stewed rabbit and plum jam. On the
fourth day the creek rose rapidly, and we were com-
pelled to shift camp. Nearly starving, we splashed
our way up to the house, and found that our girl
had got the sack and an old harridan with a face
like a hidden crime was in her place. She offered
us a week-old loaf and told us not to come again.
Snowy smiled on Her, but it was no use at all. We
sold out in disgust and went to the city, where we
engaged in the bottle-o industry.
QUIDS THAT PASS IN THE NIGHT.
JIMSON (feeling his way ): “I had a funny dream last night. I dreamt I met you in
the street and ashed you for the loan of five quid.”
JACKSONn (with immense enthusiasm): “ Well, note, that’s remarkable. I dreamt I met
you in the street last night, and you lent me five quid.”
“D.D.”: Saw recently at Woy Woy
(N.S.W.) what at first I took to be a piscatorial
freak. It was in shallow water, some yards from
shore, moving cautiously, a black head with shining
eyes appearing above water. As I watched, thinking
here at last was the Hawkesbury bunyip, there was
a sudden movement, a rush of escaping fish, and a
black cat with a fish in its mouth came
shoreward. Was informed that this feline would
only eat fish caught by herself, since the Friday fish-
hawker had brought some elevated mullet.
“Doolye”: Never heard the word “lubra”
used except by whites or natives speaking “white.”
Kendall uses it to mean “mother”:—
The lubra who sat by the fire on the logs,
To watch like a mourner for him.
Like a mother and mourner for him.
The Barwon blacks use the word “gunni” for
“mother”; Kamilroy blacks, “ngumba” ; Eden
blacks, “minga” ; and the now' extinct tribes of Syd-
ney, George’s River and Hunter River used “ngu-
bung,” “wyana” and “tankan” respectively.
* * * »
“Agricola”: The reason for the popular
belief that the blue-tongued lizard is venomous is
not hard to find. When cornered he shows fight, and
expresses himself as perfectly willing to have a piece
of any trifle that may be offered him, such as a
piece of bark, a stick or even your boot. He puffs
himself out to bursting point, and when he lets
himself go the resulting hiss is similar to the re-
marks of a snake. I have encountered scores of
gohannas, jew-lizards, frilled lizards, rock lizards,
water lizards and bridgewongs, but the blue-tongue
is the only one that ever hissed at me. The last
blue-tongue I farewelled was in the act of shedding
his old suit, and may have been in a particularly
evil mood. Anyhow, though he measured only
16in. long he seized on my boot and bit through
the leather with the greatest of pleasure.
* * * *
"Bromide”: When a horse bolts or sneaks
away underground in Broken Hill the “pug” always
looks first in the handiest dead-end, and in nine cases
out of ten wins. The nags are not down many shifts
before they become as cunning as dingoes. See
them coming through crushed drives, bending to it
until they are almost on their knees in the low
places, twisting and turning until they force a way
thiough places where it looks almost impossible for
horses of their size to go, or climbing over obstacles
that may be in their way. It’s a treat to watch
them. They can work points, too, to dodge a bit
of graft. One horse pulling away from a mullock
chute was a daisy. Sometimes the “pug” would for-
get to pull the sprag out of the leading truck.
Think that neddy would start? Not he. He’d
always look round, and if he could see the sprag he
wouldn’t pull the hat off your head. But shift the
sprag and the rake would go or the tackling
burst. Another one was nicknamed “The Professor ”
He was pulling ore on the 640 where they pulled
10 trucks to the rake, but you wouldn’t hook on more
than 10; if you did he wouldn’t attempt to shift
it. How did he know? Ask the horse! I couldn’t
tell you, but I’ve seen’ them try and trick him often
and get beaten every time. “Horse-pugging,” as
driving underground is called, is a fine art, and any-
one tackling it needs to be proficient in the use of
what the Gospel shark calls “profane language.”
There’s a yarn told about the underground manager
coming across a “pug” whose language was as hot
as Sheol. “Eh, me mon, ye mustn’a swear like that,”
said the U.M. “Take the b lamp and have a
shot yourself,” retorted the “pug.” The U.M. had
about five minutes of “Gee up!” “Come on!” etc.,
and gave up disgusted; all the horse did was turn
round and look at him. “All right,” said the “pug,”
“now I’ll drive him my way. You ——- lazy
, come up!” That shifted him.
* * * *
“Mulga”: There are numerous ways of
curing sore shoulders on a horse; but here’s a
simple method which I have often seen succeed in cocky
and bush districts. Mix an egg and a small dose
of turps with some mutton fat or lard, and apply
to the wound before putting the collar on and
after taking it off. Place a piece of soft cloth
between the collar and flesh. The main thing in
curing a sore shoulder is to apply a remedy that
does not heal too quickly, so that the outside skin
chafes off again. This remedy sees to that.

WHEN BETTY GARDENS.
[For The Bulletin.]
When Betty digs, it is a sight for gods;
She takes a pickle-fork to break great clods,
With most prodigiously productive plods.
When Betty sows, the watching world may know
How large the little hand that sows, as though
Some Titan ancestor had made'it-so.
When Betty weeds—alas ! for, when she weeds,
The wind is east, and Betty never heeds
The voice that for the seedling intercedes.
When Betty stakes her plants, it is a bet
She’ll choose the biggest sapling she can get
To prop a drooping head of mignonette.
When Betty waters, all the cherubim
Look down and wish they had wherewith to swim,
So ample is the pale of Betty’s whim.
When Betty goes for beetle, bug or worm,
She squashes him with gentle foot, but firm,
Forbidding him a last luxurious squirm.
But when she moves about her garden walks,
The box and flocks and stocks, upon their stalks,
Look up and listen while my Betty talks.
She tells them tarradiddles of the ways
Of plants in other lands, of other days,
And they believe in every word she says.
She says “good-morning” to them after noon,
And cuts their heads off, to confer the boon
Of seeing how a lamp outshines the moon.
Then, when at last they’re rigorously dead,
She breathes a benison on each drooped head,
And lays them out, with tears, in shelter shed.

“Ex-missionary”: The utility 0 f the
common or garden goat and its component parts in
the Backblocks is astonishing. People could never
have lived through the drought without him
I drove a Gospel cart out to Birdsville, j n g\ V
Queensland, distributing tracts by the’ wayside
There were no sheep or cattle, and the bones of the
rabbits were piled high against the border fence
There was goat only to eat—nothing but goat for
months and months. Sometimes by way of variety
they served it up as mutton or turkey. I have
even known it to masquerade as tripe and onions
At one shanty on the road to Bourke they dealt it
out as ham and eggs, but that was after a wild and
hilarious night when it didn’t matter much what thev
called it. One individual amassed a large fortune in
Bourke by selling the hoofs late at night to the
partly-sober, under the vague designation of “trotters ”
The old man with his bell and basket was a well-
known character. He died owning many stations on
the Never Never. The milk we consumed in ]«rge
quantities before breakfast—broken down with rum.
We burnt the hair when camping out, to scare off
the mosquitoes, and for this purpose I can strongly
recommend a bit of the hide of an aged billygoat.
Some say they prefer the mosquitoes, but they are too
soft for the back country. We mended our boots
and harness with the hide and sewed them with the
sinews. We made hatpegs out of the horns and
toothpicks out of splinters off the shin bones. Very
soon the goat became the medium of exchange. We
paid for our board and drinks with him, and played

nap for a goat a corner. At the conclusion of mv
mission I took up a collection and got seven nannies
and a william-goat. The same night, whilst ,
slept, a contemptible scoundrel drove the “collection
round to the shanty and shouted for all Birdsvi e
with it. By-and-bye the shanty-keeper got a corner
in goats, and the inhabitants, having nothing to live
for, left. I left with them. My well-known o
white horse died of a broken heart at Yalpungia,
I left the Gospel waggon and the balance of t e
tracts in a dry billabong and humped my swag to
Cunnamulla.

The co. has started to get in a bit more
money—the first for many years. For a
long while its capital was only £25,000;
then water was poured in, pint for pint,
and the total was made £50,000. Now the
authorised capital is £75,000, and 57,500 £1
shares have been issued. A six years survey
shows some striking results. Though the
co.’s liabilities have grown only from £745
to £2781, the fixed assets have increased
from £29,424 to £49,284 and the other assets
from about seven thousand to 19 thousand.
In the same period the half-year’s gas sales
have in'ereased from £4886 to £11,755. And
all this has been done with no increase of
capital until the past half-year, when under
£7OOO was called up. Even assuming that
some of the increase in assets may be only
a set-off against depreciation, the progress
has been very extraordinary. And there is
no visible reason why it should come to an
early and sudden end. One thing worth
noting is that, in spite of tbe doubling of
the capital, the dividend has been increased
by only one-fifth, and there appears to be
still a very comfortable margin, which gives
reasonable hope of more than 6 p.c. pre-
sently.

This co. pushed itself into difficulties by
paying away too much in dividends and put-
ting by too little to provide for depreciation,
especially of its electric lighting plant. Then
it turned over a new leaf, cut its ordinary
div. down to next to nothing, and thereby
improved its cash position this way:—

Excess liabilities £17,381 —-
Surplus assets £895 £1568 £2,386
The liabilities consist chiefly of debenture
debt, from which £lOOO has been paid off
since the accounts closed, leaving the present
total £4500. In the 10 years the gas receipts
have grown from £3342 for a half-year to
£6750, and the electric light revenue from
£347 to £1750; and altogether you wouldn’t
know this for the prodigal who came back
to the fold eight or nine years ago and
signed the pledge.

The first column shows what a gamble it is;
but don’t worry about the poor miller- —he
can look after himself. When the 10 years
covered by the table started, he had capital
and reserves totalling £31,521. To-day they
total £39,597, and meantime he has had £1
13s. for every £1 of his capital as it stood
at the beginning of 1906. To tell the truth,
there is no more comfortable little ring in
thj whole of Australia than the millers of
N. S. IVales form. On top of that there is
a very pleasant understanding in the baking
trade, so whatever may happen to the man
who grows wheat and the other person who
eats bread, the two middlemen are all right.
The redeeming feature about this co. is that
the producer is also one of the middlemen.
Being unable at present to accumulate stocks
its cash position is very strong. It owes
only £726, while its bank balance is £19,722
and its semi-liquid assets £2646.

On working account a still larger loss was
made than in the two preceding terms; but
a new tug which had just been completed
in Britain to the co.’s order was comman-
deered by the Government at £3387 in excess
of what it cost the co., and that converted
the half-year’s loss into a profit of £Qor
The dislocation of shipping is of court
responsible for the collapse in ordinan
profits. The next comparison shows the
movement of more or less liquid assets’— *

The position is thus practically the same
as it was 7£ years ago—with this qualifies
tion: that meantime out of profits a steam
lighter for the Broken Hill flux business
has been bought for about £17,000. There
are 27 other vessels, including tugs, launches
and lighters, which stand in the books now
at about £34,000; and though they are no
doubt worth less than they were in 1908 the
£17,000 spent on the flux vessel certainly
more than covers the depreciation. So in
spite of the recent bad time, the co. on the
whole hasn’t done badly.

The 56-year-old Wallaroo and Moonta
(S.A.) has declared ss. per share (£40,000)
It seems in a fair way of distributing £1
this year, or half its paid up capital. The
output has recently been at the rate of 160
tons of copper per week, or 8000 tons a
year. A profit of £2O per ton on that output
will pay ss. a share a quarter; and nearly
twice £2O ought to be possible with Conner
at £lOO.

A Victorian syndicate is digging into the
asbestos deposits at the Asbestos Range,
near Beaconsfield (Tas.). Away back in
ISt 19 Tasmania produced 200 tons of the
fireproof niaterial, but has done nothing
since. The stuff is there all right and there
is more of it at Macquarie Harbor, but the
getting of it out is all a matter of working
costs.

“D.F.” : Australia’s first big hydro-electric
power scheme to get to work is at Lake
Margaret (Tas.), which the Mt. Lyell Co.
has been running for about a year; and if
there are any more like it about they ought
to be captured. For an outlay of £160,000
the co. gets about 5000 liorse-power, and has
water enough to put on another 1000 or so,
while if it wants still more it can use the
river again at a place lower down.
But it has plenty of power now to work
and light all its mines and the smelters,
and also to supply light and power to
Queenstown. How the cost of electricity
generated by water-power compares with
what used to come from a steam-plant may
be judged from the fact that while the co.
used to charge the local municipality fid. per
unit for electricity, it is now preparing to
drop down to 3d.

The war is likely to change the Austra-
lian fashion in mining and quarrying ex-
plosives. In the U.S.A., according to a com-
petent authority, consumers have for years
been using explosives containing no more
than 40 p.c. nitro-glycerine, recognising that
only exceptionally hard rock needs anything
stronger. In most other countries blasting
compounds of anything up to 92 p.c. have
been in common use; and it seems highly
probable that the high cost of the glycerine
will bring down the general standard.

Mount Jasper (Tas.) remains under a
cloud. Corstorphan, the present manager, is
credited with thinking that Mount Stewart
is their best asset. But the Mount Zeehan
Smelters folk couldn’t make it pay; it nearly
cooked two private triers; and if Corstor-
phan studied the assay plan he would no
doubt find the bottom level giving a much
lower average than the level above.

It is over 30 j;ears since the southern end
of the five tin and wolfram lodes at Storys
Creek, Avoca (Tas.), was tackled by a
company which, it is said, thought the wol-
fram was tin. The plant was driven by
water-wheel and consisted of trommels, jigs,
etc., which produced a concentrate that was
found to be unsaleable owing to its wolfram
contents. And so ended the first chapter.
Fifteen or 16 years later a second co. under-
took the problem of separating wolframite
from cassiterite by tbe ordinary wet gravita-
tion methods; but this too was a failure, ana
the shutters were hoisted again. In l-to
the Mangana goldfield being under a cloud
which has been hovering around ever since-—-
the miners of “The Nook” formed a syn i
cate of 12 and took up the main lease ot -
acres, and by dint of hard graft and P atieu /
in crude concentration —hand-picking, bm
ing and sluicing—managed to support tn
dependent on them, and in some cases a go
sum was put in the stocking. The mem 1
of the syndicate each paid his share ot
rent of the lease; but as soon as am*
portion of the lode was allotted it was a
of “who gets keeps.” The wolframite in
concentrate was, of course, a so ’
trouble; and, although their product 1
most of the objectionable mineral ha
“dumped”) contained a small percentag
wolframite, the buyer did not object a ®
as be got it at bis price. Whether t
of their ore went to Germany is not '
but later on it all went there until au a
magnetic separator was erected in La
ton. This separator (Wetherill) is
operating on all the concentrates

cate in August, 1914. Since then,

John Dailey, who pulled and pushed until
lie broke down the objection to his defect of
hearing and got to Egypt with the D.A.C.,
had a lot worse luck than he deserved after
landing. Within a couple of months he was
in hospital at Heliopolis nursing and curs-
ing an attack of typhoid.

Winthrop llackett’s sincerest detractors
could not deny that he worked like a bul-
lock on the West Australian. For 25
years he ran the whole show, including, for
most of the time, the writing of the daily
leader. He was not a good journalist. It
is doubtful whether he could be called a
journalist at all. Even to this, day the
West runs social notes which inform a
wearied public that Mrs. Brown has re-
turned to town. He aimed at safety before
anything else, and the enthusiastic reporter
who looked for scoops in political affairs
soon gave up the chase. Hackett invariably
demanded the official seal on political news.
In his leading columns he yearned for
safe subjects and departmental reports, con-
sumption, cancer and other cheerful topics
formed the staple matter. In his rare
attacks, however, the “old man” worked
subtly and obliquely, and the victim would
be saturated with compliments in two para-
graphs and skilfully punctured in the third.
The West Australian has been classed as
a rail-sitter, but the departed guardian of
its destinies was not so much a trimmer as
he was a non-party man, giving every Gov-
ernment a measure of qualified support. A
freak of his was to be approachable to the
humblest citizen during office hours, a tact
which was vastly appreciated by tbe bores
and ear-chewers of Perth. Ins
faults Hackett was a stalwart West Aus-
tralian. He liked to pose as an art con-
noisseur, although his knowledge of the
subject was negligible. He gave thousands
of pounds’ worth to the Gallery, 1 übhc
Library and Museum ; and Perth would not
yet have a ’Varsity but for his persistence
and influence.

The Victoria district of the A.J.A. had
a little party at its Melbourne rooms the
other night to encourage the delegates to
the Association’s inter-State conference.
Ashmead Bartlett was there and told some
tales of Gallipoli. Charles P. Smith, just
back from Servia and Anzac, told more
intimate stories of the Australian soldier in
the trenches. Charles Lee, from Sydney,
the president of the A.J.A., talked for fully
five minutes on unionism for journalists
without a. groan of dissent being heard. Tom
Mutch, of the N.S.W. district, exhorted the
brethren in his polished platform-manner.
Walter Weems, Jack Cannot, juggler Lol-
lard and a bunch of other show people,
including a section of the Belgian Concert
Party, called in during the evening to help ;
and throughout the proceedings affable Bill
Letcher, of the Argus, saw to it that
Broken Hill got its beer and Adelaide its
sandwich and soda, while Bert Cook,
Herald, firmly kept the speeches down to a
couple of sticks each. It was a great prayer
meeting.

“Murpli”: The only left-handed comp. I
ever knew was J. P. F. Walker, of Lismore
(N.S.W.). Thirty years ago I assisted him
in starting the Lismore Standard. His
right hand had been mangled in a sawmill,
and he managed with a small knob fixed
under the “stick” which enabled him to hold
the type receptacle with the crippled hand.
But to “drop” he damped the matter and slid
it out. In those days W. G. Higgs, the pre-
sent Federal Treasurer, was secretary of the
N.S.W. Typo. Society; and J. I). Fitzgerald,
now’ Vice-President of the Ma State’s Upper
House, was “father” of the Evening News
chapel.

“F.H.”: The case presently to be brought
before the Arbitration Court by the
journalists of Australia will not be the first
action of the kind. The record is held by
N.S.W. A case establishing various pre-
cedents was dealt with by the State arbitra-
tion-machinery last year. It was the first
instance of effective, concerted action in the
courts by any body of writers in the Empire;
and from the precedents the A.J.A.
will undoubtedly obtain material assistance
in placing its case before the Federal Court.
The Association is now hard at work
rounding up a set of reasonable demands
and an army of witnesses.
THE PEN AND THE SWORD.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
Little steel nib with the Birmingham name on it,
What in the storms of the world may you do?
Acres of tripe with the Censor’s sharp blame on it
Dies in the basket disfigured with blue.
Often we said that the weight of the penhandle,
Gripped in a fist that was firm for the right,
Might be far more than the weapons that men handle
Bloodied and sharp in the front of the fight.
Now it would seem that the swords have the best of
it >—
Swords —and the pencil the Censor can wield ,
Truth and free speech and fine song and the rest of
it
All to the secrecy needful must yield.
One thing alone is still left for the pen to do
This is where ink gets the run of the deck —
Pens to the front! There is work here for men to
do,
Signing the enemy’s doom on the cheque.

G.E. FLOW METERS in the POWER PLANT.
The largest steam plants in the world use G.E. Flow Meters.
The smallest plants need them even more than the big ones, because the savings are greater in
proportion to the investment.
In well=managed plants the steam Flow Meter is a necessity and not a luxury. On Boilers it shows
the output in 8.H.P., so that the Engineer can see when the Boiler is loafing, needs cleaning
or overhauling.
Losses which waste coal will be quickly shown up.
Q.E. Flow Meters are also made for measuring the flow of water, air or gas.

Little Lectures
by Nurse 'Wincarnis.’
(Lecture No I.)
Anaemia
Our blood is composed of
red and white corpuscles—
the red to nourish the body,
the white to fight disease.
In Anaemia—or bloodless-
ness —the red corpuscles are
more or less deficient. Thus
the blood cannot provide
sufficient nourishment for
the body. Therefore the
face becomes white and
“pasty” —the eyes become
dull and “ heavy ” —and a
feeling of intense weariness
pervades the whole system.
To overcome Anaemia, the
blood supply needs re-
charging with red corpuscles.
And it is here that
possesses such wonderful
power. Because, being a
blood-maker, ‘ Wincarnis ’
creates a wealth of new, rich,
red blood, which brings the
roses back to the cheeks —
gives a sparkle to the eyes
—and surcharges the whole
body with new vitality and
new life.
Begin to get well

iWindmill
Australia's early Windmills were costly and cumbersome, as the illustration of
our first Windmill (part of which still exists) pictures. But Australia’s first
and foremost Windmill —the “Bill&bong'* —is as light running as a watch, as
graceful as a greyhound, is full of efficiency, and is not costly, considering its
splendid substantial construction, its many improvements and the great amount
of work it will do, as well a 9 the great amount of labour it will save-
The “ Bills bong" lays claim to the name of “ Australis'* First Wind*
mill’ —easily first! For instance, the new system of split-bearings obviates the
taking down of the mill when after years of service new bearings may be needed.
The patent Lubricating device is so effective that the mill is only lubricated
when it is turning, and thus there is no waste of lubricant.
The self-regulator is easily first in the automatic sense, as
the effect of cyclones is reduced to that of a strong breeze.
First and foremost, its simplicity of construction is its
success. There are less gear parts, and therefore less
trouble. The material Vnd workmanship are the best
possible; in fact, it is ‘‘The Mill that Will."

GIVE YOURSELF A CHANCE.
There would be a good deal less serious
illness if people took proper precautions
when they are just a little out of sorts. Self-
neglect, a tendency not to take precautionary
measures until one is seriously ill, causes a
lot of unnecessary suffering. There are par-
ticularly two danger signals that ought not
to be neglected —shortness of breath after
slight exertion such as going up stairs, and a
headache with bad appetite at breakfast-time.
People with these symptoms are always the
people who fall victims of disease easily,
because their blood is in an impoverished,
impure state and their power of resistance
low.
The way to enrich your blood is to feed
your blood. Ordinary food cannot help you
to nourish the blood if you are out of sorts
and already on the way to illness. It is neces-
sary to take concentrated blood food, and for-
tunately this can be obtained in Dr. Wil-
liams’ Pink Pills for Pale People, the most
wonderful blood-building medicine ever dis-
covered. An old family doctor first pre-
scribed them, and they have cured thousands
of people who promptly took them in cases
of nervous weaknesses and blood ailments
which might have developed into serious dis-
ease. All dealers stock Dr. Williams’ Pink
Pills. — Advt.
GETTING A CLEAR COMPLEXION.
Constipation disfigures the complexion
with pimples and blotches. Poisonous
matter which should have been expelled
from the system is retained and gives rise
to impurities in the blood. Cosmetics and
ointments are more likely than not to aggra-
vate the trouble by blocking the pores of
the skin. Regularity must be established
to remove the trouble.
Pinkettes, the dainty new laxative, quickly
clear away all offending matter without
the least griping or discomfort. In every
household such a simple, safe medicine is
needed. Pinkettes are tiny, sugar-coated
ovals, pleasant and easy to take.
Pinkettes are a corrective for bad breath,
will clear the complexion, and are recom-
mended for torpid liver, biliousness, head-
aches, constipation and whenever a gentle
laxative is required. Write to the Dr.
Williams’ Medicine Co., Sydney, for a freq
trial sample, mentioning The Bulletin.
Pinkettes are Is. a bottle at all medicine

POLITICAL
POINTS
A TICKLISH SUBJECT.
The Attorney-General said that The Compendium,
the prison organ, was published in the interests of
prisoners, and was issued to all good-conduct pris-
oners. He would consider the suggestion to circu-
late it amongst members of Parliament.
— N.SAV. Parliamentary report.
EDITOR TO LEADER-WRITER : “Take these
notes and write me an article on ‘The
Danger of Getting Found Out'—some-
thing for the benefit of those new
readers.”
N. S. Wales departmental barometers
show that the Labor Government is losing
its hold on the Public Service vote. Holman
has evidently been reading the glass, for he
unexpectedly and hastily shot a Bill into the
Assembly granting public servants the right
to nominate for Parliament without resign-
ing their billets. This is a long-sought-after
reform that gives the service the full rights
of citizenship. But the number of public
servants anxious to go in for active politics
is mighty small; and those who do will find
it pretty hard to criticise the Government
m power and hang on to their jobs after-
wards. A more widely-desired measure is
the Superannuation Bill: the passage of
that in a satisfactory form would thaw all
the ice between the Government and the
►Service.
The Victorian committee that is inquir-
ing into the question of settling returned
soldiers on the land is making progress.
One brilliant idea is to utilise some of the
large areas of Crown land still available in
the remote and uncertain Mallee. Another
scheme is that of planting the returned
Anzacs on (or in) the unoccupied Crown
lands in East Gippsland, “where you can
travel for 120 miles without seeing a house,
and where apple-growing would probably
succeed.” Almost any land will produce
apples, if- you can prepare it, and any fool
can grow them if he knows how. And of
course the returned soldier will easily be
able to hump his cases of fruit the 120 miles
or so. Really this struggle to make farmers
of returned soldiers without disturbing the
fat landlords who have grabbed the handy
territory and are not using it, is becoming
pathetic.
THE LIMELIGHT O’ LONDON.
While a patriotic industrial exhibition was
being held amid loud applause and intermin-
able speechmaking at Wellington (M.L.)
recently, a steamer staggered into port and
delivered 80,000 dozen eggs from China.
Cackle, cackle, while the other hen lays.
The Vic. Government proposes to attract
as many returned soldiers as feel that way
disposed to H. V. McKay’s Technical Col-
lege at Sunshine, where the harvester works
are, and where they can get trained as. engi-
neers, carpenters, etc. Sunshine McKay gave
seven acres of land for the building and an
endowment of some thousands of pounds,
and he has put his heart into the getting of
results from his benefaction. And a fine
uenefaction it is—how fine we don’t yet ap-
preciate. Just at present the fashion is to
tell the returned soldier to go on the land ;
but probably two-thirds of him are better
suited by temperament and experience for
the workshop. And then there’s the ques-
tion of cost. The people who talk so glibly
about putting ’em on the soil as an easy
and complete solution of the returned-soldier
problem have never paid the bills for a team
and a turnout and a year’s tucker, not to
mention fencing and clearing and seed to
start with.
Those people who think that returned sol-
diers can be tipped on the land and left while
the community goes away and washes its
hands of them, ought to read the conclusions
arrived at by Holman and his Minister of
Agriculture after spending three days at
Yanco. Though millions have been spent
in getting things ready, it is recognised that
“the settler cannot be expected to be self-
supporting until the fifth year,” and in the
Government’s new Bill it will be provided
that “the first 20 years of the settler’s career
will consist of four years of preparation,
during which he will receive aid from the
Commission, and 16 years of repayment, dur-
ing which he will wipe off the liabilities thus
incurred.” It amounts to a dreadful slump
from the stories told hitherto; but the old
stories were built on the city land-boomster’s
imagination, while this one is founded on
hard experience.
Pretty stories are told already about one
of the schemes on which the Holman Gov-
ernment wasted a few hundred thousands of
borrowed money. On the plea that Broken
Hill wanted another water supply, and
notwithstanding that the private co.'s
entire undertaking would pass to the Gov-
ernment free of all cost in two or three
years, over £300.000 was spent on what is
known as the. Umberumberka scheme; and
as everybody is rated to support this Gov-
ernment service, the old private company
was knocked on the head two or three years
before its time. Now, though the new ser-
vice is no more than three months’ old, dur-
ing the past week it has been so utterly
disorganised that water has had to be turned
on again from the old works. The local
allegation is that the pumps were designed to
lift as a maximum less than the average
consumption; and three months of it pro-
duced a breakdown which, it seems, can’t be
• immediately repaired, because the distin-
guished patriots who run the N. S. Wales
Government imported part of the machinerv
trom Germany, and there are no “spares”
on the premises.
The N. S. Wales Attorney-General’s out-
break of price-fixing is proving a splendid
thing for his own profession, anyway, ihree
wigs with K.C. to their tails and a whole
school of lesser sharks are now roving
around a juicy bit in Sydney. The Labor
party’s Act of 1912 fixed the standard price
of gas, and told the cos. how much they
might spring if Wages Boards affected their
costs; but, notwithstanding that, the Acces-
sary Commodities Commission proceeded
lately to ask the Sydney co. to show cause
why it shouldn’t charge less.. The co. told
the Commission that, the price of gas hav-
ing been fixed by statute, gas wasn’t a “com-
modity” ; and as the Commission replied that
it was interested in every commodity, the
expensive Equity Court is now asked to say
what it thinks on the subject.
Australia has lost a good deal of its ship-
ping since the war began, and stands a fair
chance of losing more. The
Melbourne Steamship Co. re-
cently received for one of its
fleet an offer which would
have yielded a profit equal to
that earned by the whole of
the co.’s ships in six months
from the ordinary business of
trading on the Australian coast.
That offer has not been
accepted, but, as the chairman
of the co. remarked, “tempta-
tions might present themselves
which it would be difficult to
resist.” Seeing that it will be
hard to replace losses in ship-
ping tonnage by foreign pur-
chase, and seeing further that
ships are badly needed in Aus-
tralia for the coastal trade, it
is up to the Government to
consider what it can do to get
an occasional ark built on the premises.
In England they know the position is so
serious, and the need for stopping all expen-
diture that isn’t immediately reproductive so
urgent, that this year in the London parks
they have not even planted the usual crop
of bulbs. But in Australia we can still dig
baboon pits and keep Norton-Grifßths syndi-
cates going and plant the usual crop of wild
oats.
The new Indian budget has a keen interest
for Australians. Among other proposals
is the imposition of export duties on tea
(1 rupee 8 annas per 1001 b.), raw jute (2
rupees 4 annas per 3001 b.), sacking (10
rupees) and hessian (16 rupees per ton),
and though the rates are not massive they
have already set certain Australian import-
ers hinting at further increases in prices.
So far nobody has hinted that the new duties
are another reason why we should grow and
manufacture our own jute.
Here and there Australia is risking un-
favorable labor conditions and getting to
work. As a customer for foreign soda —
bicarbonate and caustic and soda ash—be-
sides other alkalis, the Commonwealth has
been paying out over £lOO,OOO yearly, much
of it to Germany. Now the big Mount Lyell
Co. is proceeding to try to supply this coun-
try with all tKe alkalis it needs, and hopes
to have some over for export. By the time
this has beta done probably Australia will
also have started extracting the more expen-
sive chemicals from coal-tar. That’s a job
for the Mount Lyell’s brother, the Broken
Hill Prop.
A STRATEGICAL RETREAT.
The N.S.W. United Licensed Victuallers’ Associn-
tion has circularised all hotel-keepers, urging them
lo concentrate their efforts on securing a decisive
vote in favor of nine o'clock closing during the
currency of the war.
BONG: “ Now, how's that for a battle-
front?”
For the general election to be held in
Tasmania on March 25 48 candidates have
been nominated for 30 seats—23 Liberals
Labor men, and three Independents. The
two main parties would have been level
pegging, but Barker, one of the Labor mem-
bers for Denison in last Parliament, missed
the bus, his nomination arriving too late
His luck was right out. The seat appeared
a moral” for him.

SEROEANT: “Head higher, Doherty!"
DOHERTY : “Am I to be always like this?”
SERGEANT: “Yon are!”
DOHERTY : “Then good-bye to ye, sergeant,

Some of the banks and Federal Treasurer
Iliggs are still sparring on the question of
gold export; and Higgs is very properly
hanging on to the gold with all his teeth.
Yet the position is just this: if we will go
on importing and don’t produce and export
enough merchandise to pay for the goods, we
must do one of two things—pay with lOU’s
or with gold. The simple plan for avoiding
the necessity for shipping gold is to practise
economy and national commonsense and cut
down our imports by one-third.
Fixing prices is little more of a cure
than the taking of the temperature in a
case of fever. The two operations are very
much alike. When a Judge “fixes” a price
he merely records what the decent trader
is prepared to sell at: he doesn’t abolish
any of the ills which prevent the decent
trader selling at a lower price, and he still
less abolishes any of the ills which keep
the purchaser from comfortably paying a
higher price. You could take a man’s tem-
perature every five minutes and you
wouldn’t reduce his fever; you can fix prices
every day of the week and you won’t thereby
get rid of the man who keeps fat on the
unearned increment of land values and all
the other social and economic curses of the
community.
Tunnecliffe, M.L.A. for Eaglehawk (Vic.),
known 15 years ago as one of the Vic. Labor
party's most strenuous and capable advo-
cates of Sosh, and therefore execrated by
the “right-thinking” press of that day as a
menacing tiger, has lived to see himself
off ered a saucer of milk. Melbourne’s most
conservative organ lately referred to him as
“one of the moderates of the Labor party,
who is becoming alarmed at the part being
played by the red-raggers.” The fact is
that what appeared alarming to Conser-
vatism 15 years ago, making the party jour-
nals foam at the inkpot, is now viewed from
quite a different aspect. The Tunnecliffe of
that time was a dreadful fellow who talked
economics by the mile in a painfully logical
and “dangerous” manner. He still does it—
but the papers don’t report him because so
many Liberal leaders now practise the Sosh
which Tunnecliffe then preached.
Mostly Robert Campbell, of Prahran, is
a cricket-statistician, and therefore regarded
with great respect by a large public; but the
other day he had some interesting recruiting
figures to offer when the Defence Minister
declared that “we shall get the required num-
bers by voluntary enlistment.” Campbell’s
calculations, based on requirements for rein-
forcements and for the 50,000 army, and on
the official returns printed in the daily
papers, indicate that for the 13 weeks to the
end of last month there was a Victorian
shortage of 1400-odd in reinforcements alone
• —and consequently no men at all towards
that State’s contribution to the new army.
Victoria, which claims to be right in the
forefront of the recruiting movement, must
provide over 5000 reinforcements a month,
apart from the 16,000 men needed by June
as the State quota of Australia’s latest offer-
ing. As the reported enlistments for the lo
weeks were, so far as the public has been
informed, only 13,787 —instead of over
15.0 Q0 —the calculator’s sad conclusions
seem to be correct. Campbell urges that
Senator Pearce’s cheerful attitude is a
frame of mind not conducive to the best
results.” At any rate, the Minister should
publish a few unimpeachable figures to back
up his optimism, so that Australia may have
a chance to rejoice with him on a sound
basis or know the worst and get really
busy accordingly.
THE POTSDAM CODE.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
The Potsdam Code has a lot that’s new
(The Code was drawn by a queer old crew) ;
It tells us War is a plain brute game, ,
And Honor’s naught but an empty name;
You start, it says, in the “Frightful” way
And crush what comes as your rightful prey,
You spare no blood and you raze and burn
And tramp all down, lest the worm should turn;
You treat your foe as a loathsome toad
And drive his babes with an iron goad ;
For there is no ruth
For sex or youth
Or helpless eld in the Potsdam Code.
The Potsdam Code has the law laid down:
No rev’rence give to the gentle gown ;
No church or tower of the brave old time
Shall sacred stand with a crest subfflue;
The halls that once were a nation’s pride
Must all come down where the Teutons ride;
The fields must lie as a sea-beach bare
And Death must brood on the parched air;
For this alone is the regal road
That leads to Fame, as our fathers showed;
And weaklings pale
Are the wights w'ho fail
To do the hest of the Potsdam Code.
The Potsdam Code in a cave was born
Where strange things yapped at the rising morn ;
It sucked the dugs of a wolf-bitch foul
And learned to talk in a grievous growl ;
It tore its dam as it waxed apace
And lapped the blood of its own bad race;
A brand of Cain on its brow it bore
And tooth and nail were its only lore;
It snarled at women and snapped at men,
And brooked no mate in its noisome den;
In slimy mode
Its slaver flowed
When fury boiled in the Potsdam Code.
The Potsdam Code is a blight on earth
That gave it harbor and home and birth;
The fields are black where its feet have trod,
The orphans wail that there is no God;
It cumbers Earth with the foulest load
That ever rose from a dark abode;
It will not pass till the arms of grit
Shall heave it back to its own grim pit;
Till the stark and the staunch and the stalwart clean
Shall tramp with joy on its grave obscene;
For there’s but one road
That the Heav’ns have showed
To purge a land of the Potsdam Code.

EFFECTIVE HARVESTING.
Now that harvesting operations arc at an end
wheat-growers freely discuss experiences met with in
garnering record crops. The behavior of different
harvesters is critically dealt with, and a mass of
expert information is thus placed at the disposal of
those interested in agriculture.
Everywhere one hears the same verdict as to the
best system of harvesting. It is accepted with almost
complete unanimity that the stripper harvester
embodies the best principles. Even owners of header
machines concur as to the superior merits of the
Australian plan of harvesting and bagging grain.
There are innumerable instances on record showing
tlie conspicuous manner in which the Sunshine system
has excelled newer methods.
The experience of the Goughian Bros., of Quat
Quatta, near Corowa, affords a case in point. Fav-
ored with an excellent crop, they were induced to
give the header system of harvesting a trial. Acquir-
ing the machine provisionally, they set it to work in
a held of good wheat. According to their report, the
results proved so unsatisfactory that the machine
had to be abandoned. Experts representing the new
system of harvesting failed, according to the Cough-
lans, in inducing it to deal with the straw. Since it
was unable to make good the machine was taken away.
Previous experience with Sunshine harvesters had
been so hapnv that the owners of Quat Quatta then
decided to test them still further. One of the larger
makes was provisionally purchased, the Coughlans
being determined not to keep any machine that failed
to efficiently perform the duty required of it. At
the time there were a six-foot and several five-foot
Sunshines on Quat Quatta, all of them working well.
The plan of the owners had been, in event of the
larger make proving satisfactory, to associate with it
in the harvesting of the particular field referred to
the already well-proven six-foot Sunshine.
Started in the wheat crop, which had baffled the
implement made on the header principle, the eight-
foot Sunshine answered admirably. Tall in straw
and badly twisted about in places by a storm, the
crop presented some difficulties, but none that over-
came the Sunshine machine. Delighted with its
performance, the Coughlans promptly sent away for
a second eight-foot, the six-foot being utilised on
another part of the estate. Our illustration shows
both of the eight-foots at work at Quat Oautta, where
they crave complete satisfaction

SPORTING
NOTIONS
The inglorious uncertainty of the turf was
painfully demonstrated in the six days’ recent racing
at Caulfield and Flemington. There were fewer flag-
rant cases than usual of triumphant “reversal of
form,” but there were several remarkable back-
slidings by animals that had appeared to be coming
on instead of staling off. The one shining light of
consistency was Amata. She beat Woorak (second),
Ipoh (third) and lownit (fourth) over six furlongs
at Caulfield. Meeting them again in the Newmarket
Handicap on much the same terms (61b. worse as
regards Woorak) she beat them again, lownit being
third this time and Ipoh only fifth. Then five days
later the game little mare beat all the crack sprint-
ers at w.f.a. over a mile. Woorak, with his com-
parative advantage in weight, might have recovered
his long-lost character for consistency by beating
Amata in the mile race, but his jockey lost his
chance by slipping a stirrup leather. Burrabadeen
and Giru, the second and third to Amata, had each
scored a win and a second within a fortnight, so their
backers had nothing to complain of. But Cyklon,
Traquette and others went back from pretty good to
unaccountably bad in their form. The difference
between the best of Cyklon’s and Traquette’s public
gallops in the Spring and their worst at the V.R.C.
Autumn meeting would have to be reckoned in stones,
not pounds. Among the two-year-olds, Kunegetis
scored a couple of wins, Wedge scored a win and two
places, Wolaroi and Deneb each got a win and a
place, and Poitrina scored two seconds.
Carlita, after suffering a defeat at w.f.a. a week
previously, retrieved her reputation by a great per-
formance in the three-miles King’s Plate. Inci-
dentally she achieved a record which never can be
rivalled. The race, which dates back to 1859, was
previously called the Champion Stakes, and Heaven
only knows why the title was changed to King’s
Plate. On account of the war, perhaps. Well,
Carlita last year won the last of the Champion
Stakes and this year the first of the King’s Plates.
And how did she win it! The mare was called upon
to make a holy show of Cherubini, the Australian
Cup winner, who had been allowed to run away from
the field when he met her on terms 291 b. better than
w.f.a. Cherubini could never get far away from
Carlita this time. After going about half the journey
the mare ran away from Cherubini, and had she been
pushed in the last furlong her time would have
smashed the record. As it was, she finished in a
leisurely way, and her time—3min. 22|sec. —equalled
the Flemington best.
* * » *
Eurobin, who has probably staled off since
Christmas-time, strikes one as being too good a
gelding to be restricted to sprints where he is bound
to figure among the top weights. Carrying the same
weight (Sst. 111 b.) as Burrabadeen in the Bourke
Handicap (seven furlongs) he was beaten a neck by
that slippery son of Bobadil and Wilari’s sister. But
whereas Burrabadeen looks not quite a Cup and
w.f.a. horse, Eurobin looks one of the very best for
any distance. Given a spell for the present and then
a slow, easy preparation for longer journeys this
handsome animal might prove himself a stayer.
Appearances may be deceptive in Eurobin’s cgse, but,
anyhow, there is more money to be earned by a first-
class distance horse than by a sprinter that is not
quite a flier.
* * * *
When the rank outsider Cherubini perpe-
trated his beginning-to-end act in the Australian Cup
there was noisy joy in Jerusalem. But there was one
man in Australia who got such a shock that he threw
five successive handsprings and leaped heavily on his
hat. This was the owner known as “J. Birks” who
had been the proprietor of Cherubini and lost hats-
ful of cash because of that direful circumstance.
Cherubini originally belonged to G. D. Greenwood, a
Maoriland sportsman, and after capturing a couple of
Derbies over yonder was brought across the Tas-
man two years ago and told to fix his eye on the
Metropolitan Stakes at Randwick. AVith him was
Valhalla, and this nag was supposed to be watching
the Epsom. “Birks” saw the horses at Work, and
made a proposition, with the result that he achieved
both, Cherubini at 1600 guineas. Neither horse won
him a decent race. “Birks” at that time had another
unreliable animal named Cadonia, which after win-
ning Sydney Cup had been sold to the German Gov-
ernment, and the Huns next commenced to talk
about Cherubini and all negotiations were complete
when war broke out and “Birks” was left with the
horse and without the 3000 guineas he was to have
been paid for it. Cherubini afterwards tried hard to
win a stake, but couldn’t manage it, and the dis-
gusted owner parted with him at auction for £126.
Almost at once the brute won a mile and three fur-
longs race at Caulfield in record time for the course.
Next he snared the Australian Cup, and was second in
King’s Plate, the place being worth £2OO. “Birks”
had reason to gnash his teeth. Valhalla landed one
race only for him, but has since been doing well on
unregistered courses. The luck of the game!
* * * *
Timms, of S.A., who had acquired Cheru-
bini, deserved to land a big race. He spent a lot
of money buying horses, among them Naxbery (2000
guineas) and De Gama (3000). Naxbery broke down
last spring when expected to make a big bid for
Melbourne Cup. De Gama is now out at grass. When
he comes back the handicappers will probably give
him appropriate welcome.
* * * *
Punters have not quite done talking about
the Australian Cup, and the divs. that a tote would
have paid on Cherubini and Wishing Cap, and of how
history exactly repeated itself in two particulars.
Last year Lempriere led from start to finish, while
Wishing Cap was steadily proceeding from a “bad
last” to a “good second.” This year the same slug-
gish chestnut did the same thing while Cherubini
was running away with the prize. Thus it is proved
that a 2j-mile race is very likely to be won or lost
in the first two furlongs. The genuine stayer that
can make a good pace from the jump has a great
chance to win all the way. Lempriere and Cheru-
bini did it in successive years when the ground was
firm, and Orline did it in 1910. And when the
ground was soft Great Scot and Marmont did it in
1903 and 1904. The jockey in every case rode “a.
waiting race in front.” There was never a chance*
for an exceptionally slow beginner, no matter how
good a stayer he might be. The distance between
him and the tireless leader was too great. He lost
his chance as surely as a non-stayer loses a sprint
race by not being sufficiently quick to get a move
on. Common-sense asks what is the good of the
more nimble horses being naturally good stayers if
they are to be unduly steadied at the outset whilst a
Cherubini is “gettihg a break” ?
A lot has been said about Cherubini s
“form” in Maoriland of yore, and his capture of
the Canterbury Cup, which is a 2-i-mile event. But
seeing that the Canterbury Cup time was 4min. 16sec.,
there was really no reason to suspect him of ability
to win an Australian Cup in 3min. 55sec. _ Also the
two-miles Trentham Gold Cup race, in which Cheru-
bini finished second, was 18sec. slower than the Aus-
tralian record for the distance. Moreover, this
despised outsider had a reputation for breaking blood
vessels in the ordinary way of business, so the
stable couldn t fancy him much for a long journey.
But he had at least been trained for the long journey
and was in this respect better worth backing than
some that had been “messed about” in their track
work.
* * * *
Two jockeys who rode at the V.R.C.
meeting are worth a paragraph. F. Herbert, who
kicked Celosia home in-the Elms Handicap at 20 to 1,
came to Australia six weeks ago from America. Her-
bert is a Canadian who rode a lot of winners in Eng-
land, and there married a sister of famous horseman
Saxby. The other mannikin is Dempsey. During the
four days of the meeting he piloted four winners—
each of them in the last race of the day. The
late W. 11. Smith had a horde of superstitious fol-
lowers in last races, many of whom would have
backed a goat in those events if Smith had been on
top.
The big English horse-fiend Red Dennis
can still be good as a circus at meetings where he
isn’t barred. At Flemington and Caulfield the
exasperated officials have disqualified him. He had
to be brought out of the stable on a special lead
and held while the jockey threw himself into the
saddle. The chestnut brute would lie down in his
box when all other horse-devilry had failed and stay
there with his hoofs and eyes turned to heaven.
Steward Croker’s daughter took a strong personal
interest in the circus whenever it was allowed. She
can drive almost any horse, and Red Dennis re-
minded her of another chestnut she used to argue
with ; but at last her father reckoned she had taken
enough risks, and insisted on the thing being sold.
* * * *
Trafalgar, the hero of a hundred fields,
was swapped for 7500 guineas at the sale of the
blood stock of P. and W. Mitchell, of Albury
(N.S.W.). The horse was bought by W. Mitchell,
one of the selling owners. Trafalgar’s price is a
record for an Australian sire. Carbine, who fetched
13,000 guineas, was bred in Maoriland.
HERB McCOY
gives his hair a last
fond touch before
stoushing aspirants
to his title.
Veteran James Redfearn, who died last
week, was a highly-respectable cricketer in his young
days. Even in his middle age his batting deeds were
remembered, and lots of unkind sports reckoned that
he knew more about cricket than horse-training. But,
as a matter of fact, Redfearn could train a good
horse as wisely as most of the others. He prepared
three winners of the Newmarket within eight years.
Sedition, who beat the great Lochiel and Carbine in
’B9, came from his stable. Next year he led Churchill
in, and six years later his good mare Maluma did
the trick. When he sold Maluma she was sent to
England, and there landed at least one big handicap.
With Malvolio he took the Melbourne Cup in ’9l,
and, though the animal failed to win another race, it
is still an article of faith with certain ancient authori-
ties that he was an ill-fated “good thing” for the
following Cup—a carefully-saved “certainty” that
didn’t eventuate. This was the race that Glenloth wor.
in blinding rain and “a sea of mud.” Malvolio
dropped back to the rear soon after the start; the
story is that something went wrong with the burly
beast.
* * * *
For consistent running the Victorian jump-
ing prad takes the bun. At Moonee Valley on
February 23 Craganour started favorite, Gilead second
favorite for the hurdles. The favorite broke a blood-
vessel and was pulled up. Gilead ran a poor fourth,
the winner being a stable-mate, Sederick, who
started at 15 to 1. A week later Craganour, starting
at 15’s, landed the goods from a fair field, in which
Gilead also ran. In the next effort Gilead, starting
at 20 to 1, appropriated the Pines Hurdles at Flem-
ington from a crack field, including Craganour. All
of which shows what an easy job the punter has if.
he keeps cool.
* * * *
Seems that when Grand Fleet tried to
make a final run in the Australian Cup and failed,
the ex-hurdler wrenched a fetlock joint. Or per-
haps he had previously wrenched lit. Anyway, it’s
wrenched. Rathfarnham, the other hurdle racer in
the field, dropped out of the running through over-
reaching himself.
Of all the defeated public fancies in the
Australian Cup “boil over” honest Carlita and the
weary-looking Grand Fleet (Bst. 41b.) were the least
disgraced. The latter, for just an instant, looked
dangerous at the distance, hut his effort failed ahnost
as soon as it began, and Carlita carried her 9st. 81b.
burden just ahead of the big gelding into fourth
position. She was giving 171 b. or more to each of
the placed horses, and was probably going a trifle
faster than anything in the last 100 yards.
A long time ago The Bulletin remarked
that Hush Money was the cut of a stayer. Had the
deep-chested mare (who is not a big one) been
trained only for a long journey when she was getting
very light weights she might have won a Melbourne
Cup, for which as a four-year-old she was handi-
capped at 6st. 131 b. In the Australian Cup the other
Tuesday she was always among the first quartette in
pursuit of the runaway, and she finished within two
lengths of the record-time winner. This with Bst. lib.
on her back.

Queer stories are told about a give-and-
take system of jockeyship in jumping races in Vic-
toria, and every minor event in the hurdle or steeple
line of “sport” gives a color of truth to those queer
yarns. In a field of, say, 10 or a dozen it is a
common thing for six or eight of the starters to drop
behind the front rank as though their riders had no
thoue-ht of trying to win.
* * * *
When Tete-a-Tete arrived first in the
Jackson Stakes at Wanganui (M.L.) the other day
she raised T. H. Lowry’s winnings for the present
season to over £12,500, which is a record for Loan
Land.

There was a wild and woolly disturbance
at Sydney Stadium on Saturday after Arthur Scott
told “Red” Watson and Frank O’Connor to go ahead
and assault one another. For a time Watson had
none the best of it, O’Connor evading his desperate
wallops and hitting back with a hard, purposeful
punch. The trouble was that Watson took little
notice of these attentions. He can’t box worth tup-
pence, but he waded in carrying a welt in either
hand and gradually wore the other fellow clown, the
end being visible in the fifth, when O’Connor’s knees
began to wobble and his face to assume an expression
of pained anxiety. Mainly by hanging on and retreat-
ing he saved himself until half-way through the
seventh, when he went down for the third time, and
-the towel ended the argument. O’Connor showed a
lot of courage, but he had not the strength for such
a rugged basher as Watson, nor the boxing skill to
make as much use of a straight left as the occasion
demanded. A man who could use his left and then hit
Watson six rapid blows in the stomach with a cannon
ball, smash him thrice on the jaw with a hammer, and
then leap to the other side of the ring, might reckon
on keeping clear of trouble.
* * * *
At Melbourne Stadium on Saturday Henri
Demlen gave Nicol Simpson 6£lb. and hearty greet-
ings for 13 dreary rounds. The Englander, with
mind and body making about two knots an hour,
premeditated various ouslaughts, which Demlen
casually upset by changing his address. Henri was
dashing in with hard knocks to the head, but, in
an effort to change the venue lower down got too
low and was passed out. Whereupon the crowd
raised objections to the referee in 16 languages and
pure Australese.
“Rata”: About “Eryander’s” remarks (B.
17/2/’l6) on the Tom Spring-Jack Langan fights.
Spring’s real name was Thomas Winter. “Eryan-
der” says the second contest between the pair lasted
over two hours. “Fistiana” gives the time as lhr.
48min. ; “Puglistica” lhr. 49min. In his second
challenge to Spring, Langan stipulated for a boarded
stage, as did Cribb when he fought Molineaux; and
after a deal of wrangling Spring agreed. With
respect to Spring’s tender hands at the conclusion
of the fight, Spring’s principal backer, in congratu-
lating the champion on his victory, said: “But if
you ever fight again I will never speak to you any
more, Tom; I never saw such monstrously bad
hands in my life.” “Sir,” replied Spring, “I never
mean to fight again as long as I live.” But he did,
though not in the ring. Once, and once only, was
Spring tempted to .enter the game again, and that
arose from a quarrel with Phil Sampson in 1828.
They came into collision at the Epsom Races a short
time, after the quarrel, and a desperate impromptu
battle took place in a refreshment tent. Four fierce
rounds were fought before they were separated.
They subsequently came together at Tom Belcher’s
hostelry, the Castle Tavern, of which Spring became
proorietor, and where he died in ’5l. Sampson
challenged Spring to fight for £3OO a-side. In the
end, however, both expressed regret for the occur-
rence at Epsom and shook hands. Langan and
Spring had meanwhile become firm friends, and
their friendship lasted until Langan’s death in ’46.
On every anniversary of their second battle Langan,
who made a considerable fortune as a publican and
spirit merchant in Liverpool, sent his former adver-
sary a keg of “Irish.”

It took about 11 weeks to get through the
big international wrestling tournament staged at the
Manhattan Opera House, New York, and concluded
on January 29. There were 450 bouts during this
prolonged exertion, of which 326 were in Graco-
Roman style and 128 catch-as-catch-ean. The results
in the latter class were too confusing to allow of a
decision being made, many of the competitors’ with-
drawing on account of injury or sickness. The Grceco-
Roman championship went again to Alex. Aberg, the
Russian, who before the contest started had given
Waldek Zbyszko his first taste of defeat. Aberg is an
impressive person who scales 18st. 111 b. ; he is
described by a Yank reporter as “a cross between a
physical Hercules and a spiritual gorilla,” which
isnt very clear, but in the case of a man who had
a habit of flinging large, meaty opponents through
the Opera House scenery and dropping them on their •
heads among the furniture expresses things in a
pobte way Pierre La Colosse, the French competi-
t r, -wanted to take on all the German wrastlers in
a heap, but the cheerful proposition didn’t come off
Pierre is a stnpliig of 28st.

«n Jo sIIOU M like to point out to
Cleido (B. 9/3/16) that in emphasising the dif-
ference of conditions between the old-time fighting
ancl the new, I neither said nor implied that the
modern glove-specialists are in any way inferior, to
the bygone bare-knucklers. Indeed, in many respects
the modern puncher is an improvement; but, when
rushing to the other extreme, “Cleido” credits the
glove-man with more strength and greater powers'
°c ei / c fi' l ' a, ] c( 7 than the old naked-fister, and further
asserts that there is more fight crammed into a three-
minute round of to-day than .into half a dozen of the
old battles, he merely makes it obvious that he has
never seen a well-contested bare-knuckle fight, and
that from a knowledge of half the subject he is
presumptuously pronouncing upon the whole. The

Lily de Beaurepaire, a sister of ex-cham-

ship of Victoria at the water-carnival of the Brieh
ton Ladies’ Swimming Club. No men were admitted
to the frolic, by the way. But when the G-G’s
wife arrived to give her blessing Mayor James Grout
was waiting on the mat with a bevy of councillors
and their wives, while Bill Adamson, MLC with
hi* missus, was also in attendance. After the usual
purrings and politenesses the womenfolk detached
themselves from the rest of the party and went
inside, the baths-door banged, and the excluded coun-
cillors went grinning off to have a game of bowls.
To its credit let it be told that the Yankee
Lawn Tennis Association didn’t drop a challenge on
Australasia’s doorstep for the 1916 Davis Cup. The
first Monday in March was the last day for entries
and the Australasian Lawn Tennis people feverishly
waited for the postman, but he came not. Other nations
which have hitherto struggled to secure the utensil
are too busy with a rifle to bother about the racquet

Victoria Football League is wrestling with
a very important problem—nearly as important as
the war. After the nine component clubs had
implied their willingness to play this season, and had
helped to draw up the programme, four (Melb.,
South, Essendon and St. Kilda) changed their minds
and drew out. At latest the other five (Carlton,
’Wood, ’Roy, Richmond and Geelong) had decided
to go ahead, but five teams won’t make much of a
competition, so the League will probably close down
“in deference to public opinion.” One consolation
is that if play has to be abandoned the balls can
be sent to the rest bases behind the trenches for the
wearied soldiers to punt about for an hour or so.

Westralia has dropped into line with the
Australian Rules football Leagues of the other States

“Lance Private” : How’s this for a long-
time swimming record? In 1908 a schooner, owned
by Mark Rubin, was mothering the fleet of luggers
on the head of the Ninety Mile Beach, Broome
(W.A.). She was in charge of Captain Ansell C.
Gregory, an R.N., and had about 20 people on
board, only four of whom were white. A willy-
willy played old Henry with the fleet, sending some
luggers to the bottom and others on to the beacti.
The schooner herself turned turtle about eignt
o’clock on the Monday night. The skipper and the
boatswain, Pedro, a burly Island boy, were the only
two survivors. Pedro came ashore about nine
o’clock on Tuesday night, and the skipper ahou
11 o’clock, after being in the water -a an
27 hours respectively, with a gale raging the who
time and without any support. Captain Greg
afterwards became, and now is, harbor-mastei
Broome. He also piloted H.M.S. Gibraltar n
Broome to Fremantle when she convoyed
destroyers Parramatta and Yarra to Australia.

Everybody Needs Exercise!
Because it is the natural stimulant for replacing the waste tissue
of the human system.
Every effort you make causes the destruction of a greater or less
quantity of tissue in proportion to the exertion involved.
This process is going on every minute of the day, and-unles3 you
exercise judiciously the accumulation of waste tissue will debilitate
your system.
By performing a few, simple, yet scientific, exercises, such as
those comprising the
Baker Course of Health Exercises
you immediately expel the destroyed or worn-out tissue and construct
new tissue to take its place.
The benefits to be gained are illustrated by the
results others are receiving:—

GRAMOPHONE
The Popular “Excello.”
Hearing Gramophone tone and comparing it with that of other
talking machines, one would naturally think the Gramophone
is an expensive instrument. It is not so. Whilst you can pay
up to £65 for a Gramophone you can also get one for as little
as £6/10/-
That is the improved “Excello”
No. 3, a popular, hornless model
in fumed plain Oak, selling at
£6/10/-
It is an ideal instrument for the
average home, because it does not
occupy much space and is easily
portable. In tone and accuracy of reproduction it is typical of
His Master s "\ oice,” which has ever stoo«d for perfection.
The Gramophone” factory is busy making munitions. Early
ordering is now advisable.

Surgeon-Major H. B. Hinton, reputedly
the oldest living medico in the British
Empire, had his 103rd birthday in Adelaide
on March 7. lie was born near Portsmouth,
England, and has lived in six reigns. While
Dr. Hinton was cutting his teeth _ George
111. was on the throne and Napoleon was
beginning his Hundred Days.
“Billy Blue”: Sydney Botanic Gardens
and Mrs. Macquarie’s rock chair in the
Domain will celebrate their hundredth birth-
day on June 13. But the famous old “Wish-
ing Tree,” about which hopeful females still
mutter their hearts’ desires, will have to
wait till 1918, if a newspaper correspondent
of 1872 was correct. This is what he wrote:
Redburnburg, Singleton, 23rd March, 1872. —My
attention having been drawn to an article relative
to the large Norfolk Island pine in the Botanic
Gardens in which you state it is not known when
the said tree was planted, I beg to inform you that I
planted it in the year 1818, at which time I was
employed in the Gardens. It had previously been
planted in the garden near the watercourse (Tank
Stream), and had been washed out during some
heavy rains that occurred about that time. It was
lying half buried in the sand for almost six months
when it was removed and planted by me in its
present situation, in the year above mentioned. Mrs.
Macquarie was present on the occasion, and handed
me the tree to place in the ground. It was then
about 2ft. 6in. in height.—Your obedient servant,
John Richardson.
The giant from Norfolk Island is now 100 ft.
Victoria’s vital statistics for 1915, pub-
lished last Week, show some results of the
war clearly. Marriages sprang to a record
figure—l2,B32 as against 11,830 for 1914 —
and, significantly, the increase was confined
to the metropolis. Births decreased to
35,010, from 36.225, the decrease being
almost wholly confined to the country dis-
tricts, though there is no obvious reason for
this. The “war babies,” about whose eter-
nal salvation the unco’ guid worry so much,
apparently mislaid themselves somewhere,
only 2012 illegitimates transpiring, as
against 2016 in the previous year. Deaths
numbered 15,823, a decline of 680, but of
course the deadly tallies of Anzac are not
included in this lot.
Melbourne now has a Council of Sex
Hygiene and Morality, with Samuel Mauger
as president. The work of the new body is
declared to be “mainly educational,” while
one of its aims is “to watch all legislation
likely to influence the moral tone of the
community, and to take vigorous means to
secure laws nobler in conception than those
Oil the statute books ; to insist on their just
and impartial administration, and to labor
for the time when a single standard of
morals shall be acknowledged by Church,
State and People.” It is fine, large lan-
guage ; but the membership fee is only ss.
In these days a whole State can’t be morally
educated in such penury. There is nothing
much to be done with a few irregularly-dis-
tributed tracts, printed in small type and
preaching an obscure gospel in indefinite
terms. What the Council should do is to
decide on a definite, up-to-date platform,
demanding certain common-sense reforms
such as are now being individually advo-
cated by various medical men and scientists.
Then a bull-ant agitation should be started
among members of Parliament and news-
paper men. No reform worth while can be
started without the bull-ant tactics.
Hubert Brothers, from the veldt: —
At a meeting held in a small Dutch town here-
abouts the other day “God Save” was played, and
the two local doctors (one a naturalised German
and the other a Dutchman) had a rough and tumble
owing to the Dutch sawbones not taking off his
hat. The German knocked it off. Also, a whisky
agent noticed two ex-rebels stand covered during the
music, but was too far off to take action. After the
meeting he cornered them and said: “I noticed you
two did not take your hats off when ‘God Save the
King’ was played. It might have been a mistake, but
I’m going to whistle it over again. I can’t whistle
well; in fact, I know only two tunes. One is the
National Anthem and the other isn’t; and if the
tune I whistle doesn’t sound like the one it is
meant for, you’ll know what it is intended to be.
Now! ’ and he started to whistle. It sounded
more like “Bonnie Mary of Argyle,” but the two
Dutchmen uncovered. The agent of the Scottish
dew was a mighty man of brawn.
“Maginnis Magee”: The recent mutiny
at Liverpool (N.S.W.) reminds me of a
similar happening at the Curragh, Iceland,
in the early ’Bo's, the offenders in that in-
stance being about 50 men of the 19th Hus-
sars. As at Sydney, the outbreak was the
result of proposed extra drills or parades.
The Hussars didn’t kick up a row or spill a
drop of beer. When the “dress” sounded for an
extia parade they walked quietly to town;
so none others besides the military authori-
ties and the men concerned were aware that
a mutiny had occurred. However, these nice
manners of the mutineers availed them little
or nothing, as a court-martial fitted them
with sentences ranging from five to 20 years’
penal servitude.
Opinions vary as to the value of the Mel-
bourne markets, to either the producer or the
consumer, with a general leaning on the
part of the layman to consider them rottenly
managed and poorly supervised. Much of
the trouble is due to a miserable assortment
of municipal by-laws and a niggardly admin-
istration thereof. As for the fish supply, once
the bright, blue barracouta and last week’s
catch of flathead have been got out of the
Melbourne market, before the more notice-
able stage of decomposition has begun, their
disposal automatically passes into the juris-
diction of the municipal authority in each
suburb; and not one of them in a dozen
cares if the barrowman or pony-carter keeps
his stock under the bed during the night or
hangs it out to air in the stable. Campbell
McCay, superintendent of City Markets,
seems likely to become a practical friend to
the inadequately fish-fed. He has drafted a
by-law providing for fish-trucks, to be estab-
lished under municipal control in fixed city
and suburban positions, whereby a direct
supply of fresh sea-inhabitants will be avail-
able. The recent municipal conference on
fish supply and distribution declared this
scheme, suggested as a good move by the
market committee of the Melbourne City
V°uncil, to be the best it had been intro-
duced to.

Merits your confidence, not merely because it
is the product of your compatriots and affords
constant and well-remunerated employment
to over 500 of your fellow Australians, but
because it offers to you many distinct advan-
tages which are unobtainable in any imported

THE BEALE PLAYER-PIANO is constructed on
quite unique principles, to designs born of over 30 years
practical experience of Australian musical requirements,
Australian climatic conditions, and a keen appreciation of
the fundamental limitations of the ordinary player-piano.
THE BEALE PLAYER-PIANO is the first player-piano
with the true human touch and expression—That inde-
finable something which unmistakably distinguishes the
unsympathetic, soulless brilliance of the ordinary mechanical
player-piano from the hand of the artist. Its extraordinary
controllability, simplicity, sensitiveness and delicacy of
operation compel the full expression of the personality and
musical taste of the operator.

Suffragette: “Resurgam” no better than
“Woodlands.”... .Bellerive: We like best the verses
you gotted down after hearing “Marble Halls”: —
I dreamt I was a soldier bold,
Mid bullets and din at the front,
The turks did run as I shouldered my gun,
To charge in the great battle brunt,
Amid shot and shell in the awful pell mell,
Where blood did flow like a stream,
T shot twenty ore with my own very gun —
Then awoke with a start from my dream.
. ...E.8.8.: Weakly conventional. Fit for a high-
class magazine. .. .Sarto: You don’t get your point
out clearly. “Sweet Music” isn’t sweet... .K.C.:
What sort of “Kiss in the Dark” is that?... .M. 8.:
“Cockying on Shares” doesn’t move U5....J.D.: You
say, “Take a lesson from John Bull and live a
better life.” Well, even John’s habits occasionally
come in for criticism. .. .Vi T.: But you ought to
offer apologies. The taste is rotten and the humor
worse. .. .A.G.S.: Stiff, formal rhymes. .. .E.L.:
Glad you think they’re “poems.” We think them
poor imitations of bad verses you once read....
J.W.: That drunk horse of yours is the most per-
sistent beast in his cups we have ever met. This is
the third time he has arrived. For Heaven’s
sake, sell him to a poet.... J.R.: Don’t
care a crayfish claw about it so long as
you write that sort of lame verse... .J.W.:
Fancy talking about “mine eyes” to buck-
jump riders!... .W.C.E.: Cheerful jingle, but not
weight enough. .. .E.C.P.: Well, when you snare
those thoughts send them along. .. .M.F.: We don’t
reprint. If you want an opinion don’t send copy
that looks like something written by a drunk croco-
dile and preserved for five centuries in an Egyptian
tomb. .. .M.M.S.: Pumped-out emotion; suggests
soapsuds instead of rivers and oceans.... No
Laureate: Well, let them be damned, but don’t write
bad verses about it... . Racey Beaver: The way you
yowl Australia over and over again makes your verse
sound like a collection of rat-traps closing on a fat
cat’s tail.... Drift: Thought we had struck a fine
opening—“I started with a few murders,” but found
the “murders” were only “hundreds” written with a
grasshopper’s leg dipped in soup.... Bill G. C.: If
you write on two sides of the paper, Bill, you
heavily handicap yourself before you start.... Tar-
rangowen: Imitation of “Den” doesn’t get to any-
thing. .. .G.R.H.: Good enough bit of parody; but
not one reader in a thousand knows the lame origi-
nal well enough to get the points. .. .E.J.O’Ck: Not
! well enough done.'. . . Senr. O. W. C.: Well, it’s a
miserable thing Muirabit: It “behoves” us to let
it “wend its way” home.... Cockney: Your “idle”
of the town who made “sweet propoises” doesn’t
work her spells here... .T.S.: No joy in them....
G.S.: Might sell somewhere else. .. .Vagrant: Yarn
no good. Why do you hurl colons and semicolons
about like that?... .Humpty Dumpty: What is it —-
riddle or horrible warning?. .. .M.E.W.: “Photo-
play Writing” doesn’t score. ...Lek Devar: Too
crude. —P.S.L.: “Office Boy” extinguished in two
places.... Maphsu: This isn’t a matrimonial agency.
S.W.M.: Ring yarn too slight M.C.M.:
Jimmy’s snake isn’t an interesting reptile. .. .Per-
simmon : A yarn that might go in quarter the space.
. ...M.W.: 0ut....A.T.: He may have been worth
it, but the verse isn’t. . . .M.E.L.: Thin and wheezy
and an*mic. ... W.S.: Historical catalogue in bad
rhyming prose is declined Cap. Ella: Worse first
attempts have been known... .H.P.: Oh, confound
the “never-tiring crow.” He doesn’t fly in Maori-
land, anyhow, except the rare bush varieties of him
that you never saw H.0.G.: What did you gash
your hand on —the sharp corner of one of your
verses?. .. .M.C.: Too rough. .. .F.P.: Good yarn ;
that’s what induced The Bulletin to publish it
many years ago Mulga: All right One of the
Billjims: Nobody knows better how many men
earned the V.C. on that job; on the other matter,
we're inclined to agree with you, although the com-
plaint can be overdone a bit. .. .Cornstalk (Egypt):
Same good luck to you F.R.L.: All right. What’s
his address? He shall have 0ne.... Bob S.: Thanks.
Floreat: But don’t hug the idea that all the
returned Kangaroos will want to go on the land.
This paper knows of a few who have been there, and
swear they will never go back if they can' get
tucker at any other job. What are we doing in the
way of making other jobs for them ?.... Trooper
Wye (Egypt) : Had a par. about that some time
ago. Thanks.... Bad Australian: Christmas message
to hand. One with you for luck Spraggs: Pity
that Licensing Courts don’t issue splitters’ licenses;
otherwise, it’s a good yarn Cocky: Doing all we
can in the matter Ex-C.: Far too long; they're
not pars., they’re serials O.O.: Contributor in
ahead of you about the Kurow. .. .Flabby Paul: That
was quite young and kittenish compared with some
we have.... Pub: Time that old fake was buried.
....The Rattler: Send them along and we’ll read.
lI.M. : I want to drop on an argument
which is frequently used by Chadband. That
illustrious and always-to-be-suspected char-
acter says that “those engaged in the
alcohol traffic enjoy prerogatives which we
deny to the baker, the grocer, the draper and
hundreds of others engaged in the supply of
tlie necessaries of life” —meaning, of course,
in the matter of trading hours. The line of
argument has a pretence of reason, but it
is a fraud like its originator. Liquor does
not fall into the class with the goods sup-
plied by the baker, the grocer and the
draper. It is in the refreshment or amuse-
ment class. For the blue-ribbon argument
to be sound it would have to be upheld
against ginger-beer, ice-creams, theatres,
music, picture shows, late suppers, coffee
stalls, motor-cars, slot-machines, and all the
various items with which people refresh or
amuse themselves mostly after, or before,
the hours during which the baker, grocer and
rag merchant transact their business. Some
of these trades have greater prerogatives
than the beer trade. For instance, ginger-
beer and the frequently unwholesome ice-
cream can be obtained up till midnight and
on Sundays, and so can the fare provided by
the steak and oyster chandler; the pie-stall
rages in the early morning, and the man
whose favorite dissipation is a sea bath at
dawn can get it any any of the regulation
baths. As a matter of fact, the liquor busi-
ness is more burdened with restrictions than
any of its real kindred trades.

This is the Car for you to Buy.
This new Overland gives you the greatest pound-for-pound value it is possible for
any motor-car manufacturer to offer.
The quantity of motor-cars which one
maker can build and sell determines what you
must pay for a car and how much you get for
your money.
The greater the quantity the less the cost
per car.
The output of our factory is 1000 cars a
day.
This model is built to meet the demands of
those who desire a small, light and econom-
ical car.
Yet, while it is very inexpensive to own
and operate, it contains the high quality for
which Overlands always have been noted.
Cantilever rear springs, deep soft uphol-
stery and large tyres give unusual riding
comfort.
The wheelbase is long. But in spite of
this the car weighs only i 9cwt.
The motor, which is powerful and efficient,
is designed to give the highest degree of
economy.
It is of the latest small bore, long stroke
type with cylinders en bloc.
A comparison of this car with others
selling at a similar price will convince you
that this is the car for you to buy.
Ask us for a demonstration. Then ride
in it. You will find it doubly convincing.

Austral-Kodak
PHotographic Goods
Made in Australia, by Australians, for Australians.

r*.
The huge Austra/- Kodak Factory
at Abbotsford
covering a total floor area of about two-and-a-half acres,
and costing for building and plant about £lOO,OOO.
At Abbotsford —only a few miles from Melbourne, on a bank of the
river Yarra —is located the greatest manufactory of photographic
requirements south of the line.
Founded in 1566 for the manufacture of dry plates, it has now
reached huge dimensions in both size and capacity.
Australasian photographers should feel great satisfaction at having
this factory in their midst. The business was built up and is run by
its Australian proprietors, the factory is manned by Australians, and
its aim is to produce more and more Australian goods, for Australian
photographers—always keeping in view the Austral and the Kodak
reputations, for quality.
Some of the principal lines manufactured at the Austral-Kodak
Works: —
Kodak “N.C.” Film —the dependable Film, a vital link in the
efficiency chain.
Austral Standard Plates —rich emulsion —fine grain. Always
fresh, therefore best.
Austral Anti-Therm Plates —safely worked with solutions at a
temperature of 90 degrees.
Austral Lantern Plates —the standby of professional slide-makers.
Austral Bromide Papers —for 28 years the standard by which others
are judged.
Austral Nepera Gaslight Paper —the simplest printing paper
known.
Velox Paper —in every grade and surface.
Kodak Velvet Green —gives carbon-like effects without toning.
Kodak Self-Toning Solio —a new paper. Test it for yourself.
Photographic Mounts —all varieties for professional or amateur.
Kodak Chemicals— —put up in Australia to suit local conditions.
Anti-Therm Fixing Salt —safe up to 90 degrees ; try it.

THE DAY OF THE EXPERT , To-day is the day of the expert—the man who knows every detail of his work
-—who is thorough, efficient and up to date. The engineer who desires to reach the top of the tree in his profession must
be conversant with every engineering method which makes for speed, complete craftsmanship, and for economy.
THE EXGIXEER WHO DOES NOT KNOW of the Oxy-Acetylene process is not abreast of the times; he is
at big disadvantage, and leaves himself open to the charge of incompetence.
Throughout the world to-day the Oxy-Acetylene process is the latest scientific addition to every engineering
workshop, which, fitted with this process, has an advantage over the opposition impossible to estimate. It is simple,
yet wonderfully effective; its price is trifling, and the plant is portable. Whether the broken parts require to be cut
or welded at the bench or by the roadside is of no consequence. \
Any work of Iron or Steel welding or cutting can be carried out with Oxy-Acetylene. It is revolutionising
W the Engineering trade. Broken parts that once were useless can now be successfully welded and made new
again. This, too, in the matter of minutes. Cost is a matter of pence as compared with the expenditure
of pounds in the old method of buying new parts and making new drawings and castings.
All Engineers should at once write us for free catalogues and illustrations showing the remark-
able variety of work that can be done with Oxy-Acctylene. Following are a few of the broken
and worn machinery parts our process w ill make new again:—
Cracked or broken Aluminium Crank or Gear Cases, Differential Boxes, Steering Wheels, Pipes,
Cylinders, Pistons, Cranks, Clutches, Cardan Shafts, Band Brakes, Worn Keyways in Shafts.
Pieces welded to broken Gears and New Teeth Out, etc.
Broken Machinery of any kind can be welded, including Cast Iron, Wrought Iron, Mild
Steel, Brass, Copper, Gun Metal, etc., which cannot be repaired by any other process.
The latest authoritative work on the subject, “A Practical Manual of
Autogenous Welding,” published by Charles Griffin & Co., London, states:
“Within the last few years welding by oxy-hydrogen and oxy-acetvlene blow-
pipes has been applied in thousands of workshops.” Those workshops which are
rapidly adding the process to their equipment include manufacturers, con-
tractors, machine shops, garages, blacksmiths, boilermakers, repair shops,
foundries, steel mills and railroad shops.

[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
You said to me, “Each thread of every day
Helps you to weave some fancy. When you
sing
Out of your life the melody you bring.
“Color comes to you as your fancies play,
Sunbeam and gentle shower your stores
increase,
Till Love shall come to crown the master-
piece !”
You brought me love. I heard the choirs
of Spring,
The very leaves had music in their veins,
Life’s arms were full of colored silken skeins.
You left me, saying, “Now my teaching
prove!”
My hands are idle still for lost love’s sake.
And neither song nor story can I make.
QUEENSLAND.
M. FORREST.
IN BANANA LAND
“Mil’s” friends of the saltbush :
One of the three old-time identities of Western
Queensland, the Eulo Queen, has fallen on evil
times, and is now in hospital suffering the effects of
attempted hari-kari. A short, dark, plump, pretty
woman, and educated, too—she had been a station
governess, and then kept hotels for men of cattle
and sheep. Battlers who had done in their cheques at
her house —and no man who ventured there escaped
but by the skin of his teeth—and returned broke
were helped with tucker, the footsore were given a
couple of days’ rest, and a pound-note was often
passed to the hard-up. Nursing was a hobby of
hers, and she would stay up for a week with the
sick. A curious habit of hers was to throw the
bar-takings to a man she liked, asking him to
carry the money to the bank, and this without even
counting it. But she slipped downward, and the
other day she was charged with sly grog-selling. The
sheet called her Isabel Gray, but all the old hands
know her as the Eulo Queen. The other
two Western identities were Jimmy Ah
Foo, of Longreach, and Jack Howe, “the
Ringer,’’ whose tally of 325 was long the shearers’
record. Jimmy Ah Foo had a pub and a family
brass-band at Rarcaldine. During the shearers’
strike of ’9l he was ordered by the Union to sack
his Chinee cook, and had to obey ; but Jimmy him-
self was tolerated although a full-blooded Fong.
Rough people for rough times, and a lot of virtue
in their roughness.
“Ab Extra”: Re the sorrowful remarks
of “Rangan” (B. 20/1/T6) about the finan-
cial scrambles of Southern hospital com-
mittees to make ends meet. Here, in the
Far North, the chief problem of the hospital
committees seems to be to keep the expen-
diture going. Despite the fact that the
stagnant condition of the pearlshelling in-
dustry has thinned out Thursday Island's
variegated population, the balance-sheet of
the Torres Strait Hospital shows an expen-
diture double that of the times before the
Hun started to wreck Europe. It appears
that the committee had accumulated a sur-
plus, made up chiefly from the compulsory
contributions of Jap divei’s, Malay tenders
and Papuan crews, and it couldn’t ask the
Government for the usual endowment whilst
rolling in wealth. So, instead of investing
in the war loan and telling the Government
to keep the subsidy, it blewed its surplus in
an unnecessary heap of elaborate buildings
with stained windows and all manner of
frills for the use of attendants. Then with
a bright smile it held out its hat for the
usual few coppers.
Rockhampton Convention is the latest
Labor conference to condemn unification. Of
course, State Labor henchmen saw to that.
Even in Dunwich the northern climate is
killing people off at a shocking rate. Last
week 12 inmates passed out at an average
age of 75 and aggregating 901 years. A
Gaul and a Teuton, mutually hostile to the
last, died with 83 years apiece to their credit.
“F. 8.”: Rc “Daniel” (B. 2/3/T0) and
that notable Labor victory at the Water
Board elections. The endorsed Labor quar-
tette received about 4000 votes apiece out of
30,000 voters on the roll. The significance of
a party victory which consists in coming out
on top with only 13 per cent, of the total
voters enrolled is principally this —that it
has no significance at all except that the
majority of the electors didn’t care how
things went. Old A. M. Ilerzberg, the mer-
chant, was runner-up to the successful can-
didates with 3000 votes. This without any
party endorsement and despite his Teutonic
name. Not one of the victorious four could
have come near the old chap but for the aid
of the party label.
CONSOLATION TO THE GUILTY CONSCIENCE.
ERRERT : "My word, Fatty, that's bloke's a worker! Every time I passes Vs ’ard at it.”
Lancelot: "Yus, so Eve noticed. 'E muster committed some ’orrible crime and he trying
ter forget it.”
Maryborough put on its Sunday togs and
smoked its best cigar the other day to wel-
come home its old doctor, the gallant Major
Garde. The doctor participated in the scrap
of 1870, and despite his 70 years he bolted
for Gallipoli to patch up Anzacs. He looks
none the worse for having done his strenuous
little bit.
“Anzac” : Bananaland should be proud of
its quartet, White, Forsyth, Foott and
Brand. They are a credit to the staff of
the Australian army. White and Brand
have appeared in dispatches twice, besides
earning the D. 5.0.; Forsyth and Foott have
also been “mentioned.” The two first-named
are Brigadier-Generals, White being Bird-
wood’s chief of staff and right-hand man,
while Forsyth has forsaken the Light Horse
for an infantry brigade. Foott holds an
important administrative job on the staff of
the Australian and Maoriland army corps,
and Brand is ready to step into the boots of
the first infantry brigadier who drops out.
He is Birdwood’s choice. In pre-war days
these four Northern men labored hard to
raise the standard of efficiency in our citizen
army. All unassuming, and caring neither
for limelight nor advertisement of any kind,
they fitted themselves for the real thing—
and it came while they were still in their
prime years of manhood.
The Rockhampton Labor Convention has
resolved that conscription is undemocratic.
Very well ; then why all this demand to
apply an undemocratic principle to wealth?
G. H. Bennett, sub-collector of Customs
at Bundaberg, who died recently, was a real
white man. He spent his life in the Govern-
ment service, and was well known from
Brisbane to Thursday Island as a man of
the highest integrity and of no small
capacity. Cancer finished him in I.ls blst
year.
“Barcoo” : I thought the wild and woolly
West had disappeared until a Sunday or so
ago, when the car came to a standstill at a
pub about 20 miles from the rail-end. The
toot of the horn brought something in
whiskers to light. We remarked that
we had had a very dry time, but Whiskers
informed us it was “no good.” Anyhow,
he didn’t have the key. But my friend had
a coaxing manner and was soon exchanging
confidences with Whiskers. Finally, the
latter admitted he had a way of opening
the door. He went round the back end and
re-appeared in a few seconds whirling an
axe. The bar door went with the first bash,
and Whiskers was behind the counter jug-
gling with the snake-juice before we could
clamber over the ruins. We invited him to
drink with us. He did, and was a fund of
affability immediately 7. He was thrusting a
bottle each upon us, when a toot from our
car called us. Outside was a maniac whirl-
ing a lasso, and immediately our amiable
barman appeared on the verandah the lariat
descended neatly over his shoulders, and
Whiskers was trussed up and tied to a post.
The big-game hunter then informed us that
Whiskers was only his son-in-law, and that
when he “had them” he was very handy
with an axe. Shortly before we had
appeared he had armed himself; and the
licensee had hastened for reinforcements and
a lasso. The licensee suggested a drink—
and we reckoned we needed it.
The Government has decided to become a
fishmonger, and Treasurer Theodore has
already planned how to spend £20,000 on a
wharf and building near Victoria Bridge.
He is now looking round for a makeshift
trawler until he can secure a genuine punt
from J. Bull, the construction of punts
being beyond the native who has started
building his own warships.

The National Council of Women i s exdt
edly discussing Minister Huxham’s fS
ling home proposal. On Friday night M;
Bedford, who is a headlight in all SciS
which work for children, and Dr. Hell
bhaw heavily assaulted the proposed hoi
These two ladies suggest the establishment of
a number of small State refuges for mother
and babies. However, the meeting appointed
itself a Royal Commission or somethin?
is going to report to Huxham.
His Ex. presided at the annual meeting of
the Crbehe and Kindergarten Association on
Tuesday afternoon. Capt. Cosens \D(“
was in attendance, but he was lost "in the
crush of females and was last seen dinging
distractedly to a stout walking-stick for imf
tection. Directress Champling sketched n
glowing future for the Kindergarten College
which already has turned out a number of
trained teachers. The mill is at Shafston
the fine old McConnel home on the river
bank near Mowbray Park.
C. E. Jenkinson, the son of a city aider-
man, but none the worse for it, was invalided
from Gallipoli to England with enteric \ s
a recompense he has been handed a commis-
sion in the Royal Artillery. He left here
as a lieutenant with the A.F.A., but trans-
ferred to the Light Horse as a trooper and
had six months in the trenches.
Another young Queenslander is starred
11. G. Faulkner, son of J. Faulkner, of
Indooroopilly, was a trooper in the 2nd L.li.
and was invalided to England, where he was
captured by the Lincolnshire Regiment and
decorated on each shoulder.
Capt. I). 11. Caiman, of the 15th Battalion,
who has been posted wounded and missing
since Lonesome Pine in August, is now
reported killed in action. Many families
are still waiting for news of relatives who
have been missing since last April or May.
Only two Queensland regiments, the 25th
Inf. and the sth L.H., have comfort com-
mittees working for them. In other States
almost every little lot has its committee.
How is it that the 9th and 15th Battalions
and the 2nd Light Horse have not been
looked after in the same way?
The Women Students’ Club of the Uni. is
giving a luncheon on Monday to welcome the
“Freshers.” Almost all the new students
this year are women—the men are mostly
forming fours at Enoggera.
The Wool Spinning Guild has not been
idle since its last meeting. Consent for a
local woollen mill to do the- necessary card-
ing was wrung from the Defence Depart-
ment, and the first bale, donated by Mr. F,
do Little, has already been carded. Alec
Rae, of Goondiwindi, has promised another
bale when it’s wanted. All that is required
now is some money 7, a room and some spin-
ners. And they’ll all come.
Lots of us are gnashing our expensive
teeth at the report that an Australian woman
living at Plymouth delivered a lecture on
“Australia’s Share in the War,” and was
“accompanied by two Anzacs, each of whom
had lost a leg at Gallipoli.” The mania for
lapdogs and performing monkeys isn't in it
with the latest craze for exhibiting maimed
soldiers.
Yours affectionately,
AUSTRALIA JANE.
State revenue is still on the increase; but
for every extra £1 that has gone into the
Treasury during the past eight months the
Government has spent an extra £7. Ryan
is faithfully understudying Holman and
Scaddan.
The Government is evidently in no hurry
to appoint a Minister in place of the late
Dave Bowman. Later on Huxham, present
Assistant-Home Sec... will no doubt take the
late Minister’s place, and probably the cap-
able T. L. Jones, or Gillies of Eacham, will
be invited to the inner caucus.
W. F. Webb, the recently-appointed Offi-
cial Solicitor, sets a fine example to civil
servants. Not content to wait until seniority
dragged him aloft in the service he spent his
spare moments qualifying for the Bar. Then
when the Ryan Government wanted a poor
man’s solicitor he was waiting for the job
at the age of only 29.

available blast furnace is in commission, and
last year’s output of pigiron was roughly
38,000.000 tons. Yet the U.S.A. only dis-
covered that it was a great iron and coal
country a few years ago. Until then it had
been choked off the business, just .as Aus-
tralia has been, with the yarn that iron and
steel are an old-country’s industry.
A more-or-less comic discussion is proceed-
ing in Melbourne between Minister Hagel-
thorn and one Schwieger as to who is en-
titled to the credit for originating the wheat-
pooling-and-marketing scheme. It is mostly
w-eariness, but it gives a chance, to watch
Fat turn dog on lifelong, ingrained prm-
ciples and parading as the apostle of Sosh.
Labor propounded the policy of collective
organisation long before Hagelthorn came
into public notice, or Schwieger was thought
of. The 24th plank of the Vic. P.L.G.
advocates the “State marketing of produce,
and State advances against produce for
export.” That is all the wheat scheme
amounts to.
Donald Mackinnon’s opponent at the
next Vic. election is pretty certain to
be young Parker, a law-clerk, who has
enlisted for service at the Front, and
will leave his nomination and deposit
before he goes. Parker was the elect
of the Prahran branch of the P.L.C. in
October last, but subsequently two of his
defeated rivals —one of whom had the ladies
of Prahran at the back of him —had his
selection cancelled, on a technical point or
something. Parker appealed, and the Execu-
tive decided on another ballot. Now the
candidate who won by 50 lengths from a
field of six in October is expected to win
even more easily this time.
“Karee,” from a vague place called Front:
These Senegalese with a grin that refuses to come
off are a queer, philosophic mob. I asked one
—he had five clasps on his medal and had gained
a single stripe after 10 years’ service—if he was
content to go on warring to the end of his days.
He shrugged his shoulders indifferently: “Content or
not content, what matter if the Government say
content?” Their women act as porters and carriers
and the children travel with them. I know a lad
of 14 who has been wounded three times and was
by his father’s side when the Turks finished dad in
Gallipoli. When a male child is born on active ser-
vice the youngster is consecrated to Mars on the
barrel of a mitrailleuse. But all the Senegalese are
not from the Senegal. Lots of them hail from the
Soudan, the Congo and Madagascar. The Martinique
negroes are rated as whites and have a battalion of
Zouaves to themselves. They get mighty sore if
mistaken for Senegalese blacks. I stopped one who
seemed to be a tirailleur, but was a Zouave with
the linqua Franca of the African colonies. He gruffly
told me to speak proper French. I heard afterwards
that he was a barrister at St. Pierre. In one of
their pay books I saw this entry : “Unable To sign
receipt owing to wounds.” That man had lost both
arms.
Randolph Bedford : Britain’s biggest han-
dicap in the war is, firstly, the stupidity of
the executive, and, secondly, the graft of
somebody in charge of war contracts. One
good Australian supplies 6000 cases of meat
a week at 345. a case. He is not allowed to
supply it direct; it must go through an
American channel, although it is shipped
direct to London. The “American channel”
gets 60s. a case, although it never handles
one, and the War Office pays the accommo-
dating foreigners £7OOO or £BOOO a week
profit. This meat has to be labelled American,
though much of the War Office supplies of
real American origin is so bad that men at
Gallipoli refused to eat it. Representations
from the Commissioner’s office that if the
Australian fleet and the superior Australian
soldiers were wanted so badly the War
Office might stipulate for superior Australian
goods, brought the reply that all supplies
must come through the proper channel—-
such channel being rotten with the graft
fungus. There are also contracts into which
Australia could not enter —25,000 pairs of
boots for the Belgian army, straight price
6s. 9d., price to the Belgian army 18s. lid.;
2,000,000 overcoats for British soldiers, real
price 15s. lid., graft price 225. 6d. Michael-
ovitch of Russia hangs his thieves, Germany
introduces its army grafters to a firing
squad, but the British grafter prefers to
whack with an American, and nothing worse
comes his way than profits. But, apart from
that, Australia will never be any good,
in the English idea of things, except for the
production of wool —and soldiers.
“Orient” : President Yuan of China would
suggest Bonaparte in a greater degree if he
were not merely a sort of first lieutenant
or grand vizier to the mikado. He first
shone in the limelight back in 1882. Korea
had been shut up as the hermit kingdom,
and Yuan led 3000 soldiers into Seoul,
ostensibly to keep order, but really to main-
tain China’s claim of suzerainty. Then the
rivalry with Japan started. Japan also put
troops into Seoul, “to guard its embassy.”
An insurrection by Chinese and Koreans,
doubtless incited by Yuan, forced the Japs
to cut their way out and fly to Chemulpo.
Yuan was appointed Resident in Seoul, but
the seeds were sown of the 1894 war. The
illustrious Chinaman had to bolt before the
storm burst, and was technically liable to
execution. He rose again into favor and
gained world-wide notice by organising
troops on the Jap model. He was Governor
of Shantung when the Boxers shaped up in
1900. Their aim at first was to expel the
Mancliu Dynasty, as well as the Europeans.
Yuan was steadily hostile to them. They
then crawled to the Manchu leaders and con-
centrated on European expulsion. Yuan
was in high favor for a little while after
the outbreak was squelched, but fell into
utter disgrace under Pro-Boxer influence
secretly exercised. When a plot to assassinate
him was discovered the Crown gave him
an assurance of safety on condition that he
retired to his estates. He could have broken
the Revolrition. but with the army behind
him, as with Bonaparte, he raged with the
fire that cleared a way for him to the throne.

THIS' year the dainty foot daintily shod
comes into its own. Never were skirts
shorter or fuller, never were shoes more in
evidence. So the smart woman will hail
with joy the arrival of the new Bostoek styles
for the season, since these are more captivating
than ever. The shoe here illustrated, for example,
is typically charming. Cut from that most
elegant of materials, patent leather, made in
that new, short-fronted French shape which
makes every foot look so arched and delightful,
this is the shoe of shoes to give a telling finish
to one's new walking suit or gown. And it is only
one shoe amongst many equally desirable.

has yet to be discovered. This
famous British remedy is also
recommended by Medical Men in
cases of Lumbago, Sciatica, Eczema,
Constipation, and Liver and Kidney

the family of Evan Griffiths Hughes, the sole
Manufacturers of Kruschen Salts, and one of

Business, Robbery, etc.
Gaud-Mayor Meagher wants to sell Syd-
ney Queen Victoria Markets to anybody
who will plank down a sufficiency of cash.
All sorts of proposals have been made fof-
dealing with the place ; but the Council still
holds on and loses money from year to year.
As a market it was condemned long ago—in
fact, so long ago that there isn’t a shred of
proof that it is unsuitable for market pur-
poses to-day. The building is good, conveni-
ent, airy and centrally situated ; and markets,
differing greatly in kind from the regular
big wholesale sort which rage in the early
hours of the morning several blocks away,
seem to be wanted. There is a constant
desire on the part of certain classes of small
producers and backyard workers to get into
direct touch with the public instead of pass-
ing their goods through a middleman, and it
is up to the City Council to give them a
chance. These people probably require a stall
to sell their goods on one or two days of the
year only, but there are, or soon would be,
enough of them to occupy a building like the
Queen Victoria Markets every day in the
year if given the opportunity. More
than that, as their rent of selling space
would take the place of a middleman’s pro-
fit, they could afford to pay for temporary
occupation of their stalls a figure that would
be highly remunerative. If, instead of con-
tinuing to lament the failure of the city’s
venture, an attempt were made to put it to
its real use there might be decent profits
from the scheme. Undesirable classes of
wares should be strictly excluded, proper
supervision exercised over the methods of
sale, and the needs of persons with occa-
sional goods to sell considered before those of
permanent tenants. In such a market
cottage industries, which are very desirable
items to promote, would get a great fillip. Of
course, there would be no secret commissions
or other exchange of cash about the busi-
ness, but it might pay, and it is certainly
worth a trial.
“Cliff Street”: If “Copabella” fB.
24/2/T6) really wants to knock off buying
imported enamelware mugs and is not too
tired to look for an all-Australian article, he
will find that an Adelaide firm turns out the
goods he is howling for. Adelaide can shot*
us all points in this line of manufacture.
* * * *
“Dyer”: Now that German-made syn-
thetic dyes can’t be got for love or money
in mostly any place out of Central Europe
the dyer has to go back to the vegetable dyes
of long ago, with the tedious mordanting
processes, etc. Now the main mordant for
cotton is tannic acid, and there is a mighty
local rush for sumac, and sumac extract. The
job dyer is rushing around after the article
like mad, and getting madder at the price
he has to pay for it. The importer of foreign
tannin-bearing materials is on real pile vel-
vet. The best ground sumac contains from
15 to 20 per cent, of gallo tannic acid, and
the extract up to 50 per cent., when it is
honest and not sugar loaded (which isn’t
often). The Australian golden wattle
(Acacia pycnantha) contains from 15 to 26
per cent, of tannic acid, Acacia decurrens
somewhat less, and a host of other wattles
tannic *cid in quantities which would be far
cheaper' to the dyer than the imported
sumac. Yet no one hears a word of Aus-
tralian tannin being used by Australian
dyers. To see them scramble after sumac
and watch the importers rush up prices,
one would think that there was not a tannin-
bearing tree on the continent. And so it
will go on till the war is over and we can
get the cheap synthetic dye again.
* * * *
“Vin”: I wonder if I’m the only recent
victim of this trick. A well-dressed affable
gent, calls and displays four suit-lengths of
smart material, adding sadly, “Only thirty
bob the lot!” You think it seems a soft
snap; and, when he adds that the stuff will
be made into suits for fl each, you bite like
a shark —or you do if you are the same sort
of idiot that I was. Of course when you
call round at the address given you find it
is a fish shop or a plumber’s—and serve you
d—d well right. Anyhow, it did me.
The Melbourne Fire Brigade used to get
its extension ladders and fire-escapes from
Germany, and the last lot from there cost
about £2OOO. Now Superintendent Lee has
the idea that the articles can be made in
Melbourne, and, also, that local industry will
turn them out for several hundred pounds
less than the Hun-made article.
A SONG ABOUT NOTHING.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
Oh, this is a song about Nothing at All,
The restfullest sort of song.
When nothing hangs over us nothing can fall,
When nothing is doing sure nothing goes wrong.
There’s many a man in the deuce of a stew,
Can’t guess on what helper to call,
Is saved, with his wits all bemused and askew,
By doing just nothing at all.
To most of the problems that puzzle the mind
Of moralists scolding asprawl
The unguessed solution and answer, you’ll find,
Is nothing at all.
“But what do you see in me?” cries in her youth
The maid to her lovers that crawl.
How strange it would be, should they chance on the
truth
That she holds them with—nothing at all!
The whole splendid kingdom of Nothing at All
Can be owned by the poorest of chaps,
And kept in his pocket that hangs on the wall,
Though its limits transcend all our maps.
When we’re born, when we die, when our joys are
so deep
That they croon, when Babette comes to call,
When we fade out of life on the River of Sleep....
What next? We want nothing at all.
So this is a song about Nothing at All,
The eomfiest sort of a song.
When nothing can threaten us nothing can maul,
When nothing is vicious still nothing goes wrong.
There’s many a fellow sits stiff in his pew,
Despised by the gods though he bawl,
Might sit in the sunshine Creation to view,
Were he fettered to nothing at all.

IMPORTANT.
Look to Your Teeth.
There are no teeth like those furnished by
Nature. For service, comfort, and good
health, artificial teeth cannot be com-
pared with a natural set.
Sensible people will accordingly try to pre-
serve their teeth as long as possible by
keeping them clean. Cold water and soap
and water are useful, but are somewhat
ineffectual. Rough powders, such as cuttle-
fish, crabseyes, crude chalks and charcoal
are too severe on the enamel.
EUDENTA TOOTH PASTE is scientifi-
cally prepared to clean the teeth, sweeten
the breath, harden the gums and disinfect
the mouth (thus preventing decay).
EUDENTA is therefore regarded as “the
perfection of dental luxuries.” 1/- tube every-

Another Tribute to Rexona
Miss Marian Marcus-Clarke, the favorite Actress, is the youngest daughter of Marcus Clarke,
whose thrilling novel, “For the Term of His Natural Life,” has made him world famous. Miss
Marcus-Clarke made her name in America as “Mrs. Whipple” in Jack Mason’s success, “The
Witching Hour,” and as “Martha” in “The Holy City.” Returning to her native land,
Australia, she played all the principal character parts with the Fred Niblo-Josephine Cohan Co.
Miss Marcus-Clarke writes to us from the Criterion Theatre:—
_I am dropping you a line to tell you how good I have found Rexona Soap. As a
skin beautifler and as a shampoo for the hair I have never found anything nearly so
good, and it is delightfully refreshing. Everyone I have recommended it to has been
so pleased with it. I have also used Rexona Ointment. It is excellent, and I think
there is nothing on the market that in any way approaches the Rexona Remedies.
I wish you much success with them. Yours faithfully,
(Sgd.) MARIAN MARCUS-CLARKE.
REXONA
The FAMILY FRIEND.
Rexona
healthy skin,
Soap and Ointment are universal favorites with everyone who values a pure and
. The longer you neglect your skin the harder it will be to care for it. Delay
may result in Eczema, Psori-
asis, Ringworm, Running

and unpleasant forms that skin
trouble so often assumes.
Rexona, the Rapid Healer, and
Rexona Soap are sure preserva-
tives for the health and skin.
Rexona Soap keeps the skin
soft and pure, and Rexona, the
Rapid Healer, will immedi-
ately eradicate any disease
which may be apparent, for it
arouses the skin to healthy
activity so that it quickly
recuperates and the diseased
skin becomes once more sound
and healthy. Rexona is sold

THE LATEST AND SMARTEST BEAUTY RECIPES COLLECTED FROM VARIOUS
EXPERT BEAUTY WRITERS.
A “Blackhead” Secret.
An instantaneous remedy for blackheads, oily skin
and enlarged pores.
Blackheads, oily skins and enlarged pores
usually go together, but can be instantly cor-
rected by a unique new process. A tablet of
stymol, obtained from the chemist, is dropped
in a tumbler of hot water which will then of
course “fizz” briskly. When the effervescence
has subsided the face is bathed with the
stymol-charged wmter and then dried with a
towel. The offending blackheads, of their own
accord, come right off on the towel, the large
oily pores immediately contract and efface
themselves naturally. There is no squeezing,
forcing or any drastic action. The skin is
left uninjured, smooth, soft and cool. A few
such treatments should be taken at intervals
of three or four days thereafter in order to
ensure the permanence of the pleasing result
so quickly obtained.
Grey Hair—Home Remedy.
An old-fashioned, home-made recipe restores youthful
appearance.
There are plenty of reasons why grey hair
is not desirable and plenty of reasons why
hair dyes should not be used. But, on the
other hand, there is no reason why you should
have grey hair if you do not want it. To turn
the hair back to a natural color is really a
very simple matter. One has only to get from
the chemist an ounce of concentrate of tamma-
lite and mix it wdth four ounces of bay rum.
Apply to the hair with a small sponge for a
few nights and the greyness will gradually
disappear. This liquid is not sticky or greasy
and does not injure the hair in any way. It
has been used for generations with most satis-
factory results by those who have known the
formula.
To Kill Roots of
Superfluous Hair.
“Home Science.”
Women annoyed with disfiguring growths
of superfluous hair wish to know not merely
how to temporarily remove the hair, but how
to kill the hair roots permanently. For this
purpose pure powdered pheminol may be
applied directly to the objectionable hair
growth. The recommended treatment is
designed not only to instantly remove the
hair but also to actually kill the roots so that
the growth will not return. About an ounce
of pheminol, obtainable from the chemist,
should be sufficient.
The Real Cause of Most
Bad Complexions.
“Health and Beauty.”
It is an accepted fact that no truly beautiful
complexion ever came out of jars and bottles,
and the longer one uses cosmetics the worse
the complexion becomes. Skin, to be healthy,
must breathe. It also must expel, through
the pores, its share of the body’s effete
material. Creams and powders clog the
pores, interfering both with elimination and
breathing. If more women understood this
there would be fewer self-ruined complexions.
If they would use ordinary mercolised wax
instead of cosmetics they would have natural
healthy complexions.
About Hair Tonics.
“Novel Recipes.”
Each week almost one hears of some won-
derful discovery for improving the hair, and
although this paragraph may seem a little
superfluous, an old-fashioned recipe may come
as a welcome change. One thing about it is
that it will grow hair, and also prevent it
falling out. From your chemist get an origi-
nal package of boranium, to this add i-pint of
bay rum, allow it to stand 30 minutes, then
add sufficient water to make half a pint. Rub
briskly into the scalp with the finger-tips and
you will immediately experience that clean
tingling sensation which is a sure sign of
healthy action. [2

A Summer’s Day.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
FULL length along the river’s bank I
sprawl,
And doze and dream. I have no
thoughts at all.
It is a summer’s day, too warm for wishing ;
Let the lines be! I have no time for fishing.
The water’s warm, the earth is heavy sweet;
I hear cicadas shrieking through the heat.
It makes me giddy but it’s good to lie
And look straight up at the transparent sky.
It’s like a silken veil, that teases you
To find what’s there, if you could but see
through....
The bark that’s hanging from that white
gum-tree
Beats on the polished trunk unceasingly.
It’s good to lie like this, just half asleep....
The boys will now be shearing greasy sheep.
Where would I like to be? It’s hard to say—
I’ve had good fun along the Castlereagh.
The Murrumbidgee’s better, so it is. ...
And now I'm doing nothing. .. .ah, what
bliss!
Nothing at all! I lie stretched out, and
dream.
The sunlight burns the rushes in the stream,
They seem on fire That hawk is flying
far....
I’ve tasted oysters in a Sydney bar,
But didn’t like ’em much It’s soothing
here. 4
The ants are busy. I suppose they’ll dear
Their little farm; they keep milch cows, I’m
told —
Now, who’d believe it! That little soldier’s
bold,
He should be at the war ’Mid fire and
slaughter
Our boys will think of Murrumbidgee
water....
I’ll think of nothing this is all I know —
A beetle’s wings with gorgeous colors glow,
How wonderful I’ve never seen before !....
I once smoked opium in Singapore,
And felt, if I felt anything at all,
Soft, vaporous dreams all round like feathers
fall.
And so I doze and dream. But now I’m sad.
I think of all the ugly things, and mad,
I’ve ever done. A mate o’ mine was ill;
I stole ten pounds, and how I shudder still!
He never knew, he thought they’d just been
lost.
Why did I? I don’t know. I’ve paid the
cost
When I was nine years old I drowned a cat.
I’ve drunk hard, too—why should I think of
that!
There was a girl I left. We’d kiss and
chatter,
I said I’d marry her —what does it matter?
Good thoughts, and bad, how soon they fade
away;
There’s nothing real, or true, this summer’s
day!
Nothing except the shrill cicada’s cry,
The burning mirror of the cloudless sky,
The hot and heavy smell of weeds and
flowers,
The water’s slumber-song of drowsy hours.
Full-length along the river’s bank I sprawl,
And doze, and dream....l have no thoughts
at all.
VICTOKIA.
LOUIS ESON.
For One Night Only.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
LARRY, the black, head-stockman
of Kundi Kundi, came to Government
House at dusk to tell Walter Rossiter
and his two guests —Judson, the financial
manager of the Pastoralists’ Agency co., and
Wills, the manager of Sampson Hill station
—that a new corroboree, which had passed,
in the way of the blacks, from tribe to tribe,
so that at last the singers knew not the
meaning of the words they sang, had come
at last from Boulia, and would be played
for one night only by the Kalkadoons and a
few station blacks. Walter Rossiter replied
that at present he was having “a big feller
pitch,” and when the pitch was finished he
and his guests would come down to the shore
of the crescent-shaped lagoon and play audi-
ence to the new corroboree. So Larry de-
parted, and the white men returned to their
“pitch” luxuriously, as men who have eaten
heartily and have the tobacco well alight
and the pipes drawing well.
“Lots of time yet,” said Judson. “Go on
with the yarn, Watty.”
“There’s not much of it left, old man.
These two chaps, as I told you, started out
from the Corella to a copper-show beyond
Argylla, between Argylja and West Leich-
hardt—or that way, anyhow. There’s a lot
of broken country south of the Argylla, and
a lot of shocking country to take a dray
through anywhere about there. They didn’t
know the country; they went in with a dray
loaded with stores-—-two horses they had and
a dog—and they disappeared as completely
as if they’d been buried, dray and all.”
“Nothing found at all of them?”
“Not a skerrick. They were last seen by
one of the construction gang of the new tele-
graph line near Argylla; and he wondered
how they’d got the dray through that far.”
“Tracks ?”
“Tracks as good as new to the creek
bed, where they disappeared. Why, in places
out that way you can find Henry’s dray
tracks, and they’re forty years old. The
dray-track of these chaps is seen now in
places, and they disappeared ten years ago.
They were first seen six months after the
linesman met the dray. They go right up
to the bank of a sandy creek, and where the
sand meets the bank they are lost.”
‘‘Floods wiped out the tracks in the sand?”
“Yes! But even if they camped in the
creek-bed and a flood got them and carried
the lot away, the dray and the bones of the
men and horses would be there. But there
was simply nothing.”
“On the other side?”
“Nothing—only the impression of a single
wheel dried on the soft bank and lost on a stony
ridge. Yet that mightn't have been a wheel-
mark. A sapling with a rounded end dragged
through mud will make just such a mark.
No! It’s one of the mysteries—like Leich-
hardt’s party vanishing. Now, a man can
disappear in a city and leave no more evi-
dence than a stone dropped in the sea; but
a dray, two horses and two men to leave no
mark at all —why, if the earth had opened
there’d have been evidence of it! But all
there is is a sandy creek, driftwood and
wrack in the white gums, and that’s the
lot.”
He stopped to relight his pipe, and there
came to them the reverberations of hands
loudly beating time on thighs. Then Rossi-
ter arose, saying: “Come on, Juddy ! Never
mind your hat, Wills! The foreign corro-
boree’s starting.”
The white men strolled down the slope,
leaving the blackfellows’ huts on the left
and the northern horn of the crescent of the
lagoon on the right; and so up the open
park-like country to the parallel of the great
rocky outcrop which was the eastern limb
of the lagoon. The rude shelters of bent
saplings, bushes and grass which were the
wurlies of the strangers were indicated by a
few glimmering fires among the far-off trees;
the stage was before them in the half-circle
of brilliant fires to light the performance.
Ahead was a shed of boughs inclined to and
resting on one another at their highest
point and from the shed came cries and
laughter.
“Dressing-rooms ?” asked Judson.
“No fear! They’re made-up long ago.
They must not see one another get ready
unless they’ve danced the same corroboree
together before; yet this is a new one on
most of them. That’s the dukka dukka —the
green-room.”
“And where do we sit —where’s the Royal
box?”
“Outside the fires. The fires are always
between the actors and the audience.”
“Footlights! Oh, well, they can’t burn
the theatre down.”
“Larry, Larry! Sit behind us, Larry, and
tell us all about it.”
“No been knowem big feller dance,
Marmi; that one new feller.”
“All right, tell ’nother little feller dance.
Who been writem little feller dance, Larry?”
“Sometime one feller boy gettem when he
sleep.”
“He writes his dreams, eh? Plenty of white
men do that!”
“Sometime boy been make ’em after what he
findem in day-time. When one big feller
make ’em other feller buy ’em. One time my
people been sendem plenty boy long way
learnem corroboree.”
“If one tribe has a genius as an author,
other tribes send to buy the plot and the
play.”
“The dramatic rights of Kundi-Kundi,”
said Judson, lazily pulling at an empty pipe.
“Now all feller come,” said Larry—•
“Sssh.”
The audience of old men, gins, children
and dogs took their places on the slope in
front of the fires, resting on their hams, with
the old men in the front seats, the men
beating time with the flat of boomerangs one
against the other, the women loudly slap-
ping their own thighs. But four women had
’possum rugs filled with feathers, and these
they beat with their open hands. Then to the
old men making “the singing of the sticks”
and the loud reverberations of the skin
drums, the beating of the thighs and the
occasional barking of the dogs, a score of
men danced from the dukka-dukka.
Their heads were dressed with crossed
sticks tipped with corella feathers, their
faces, trunks and limbs to wrist and ankle
red-ochred; they were spiralled with char-
coal from right shoulder to left haunch.
White spirals of emudown gummed to the
body with blood accompanied the spiral of
charcoal. They wore waistbelts of human
hair, the tihari of eaglehawk-feathers over
the buttocks, bunches of singed leaves at
wrists and ankles to give a rustling accom-
paniment to the song. There were variants
of make-up—circular bands of charcoal and
kopi over the groundwork of red-ochre,
straight markings of black and white and
boomerang shapes from neck to ankle. There
were two gentlemen who had whitened them-
selves all over with kopi except lor a triangle
of charcoal from forehead to ears, charcoal
ovals on the chest and stomach, charcoal
armlets and black band at the legs and
waist. And with the big, velvet-soft starry
night about them, the glare of flame and
the reverberations of the squatted orchestra,
these actors in black, red, white and green
made a picture and a sound that caused to
the blood of the white men thrills unforget-
table.
The little acts of the corroboree com-
menced. One man enacted the finding of
money in a tree, two men the stealing of
cattle and the tracking and shooting of the
thieves.
“You know that one, Marmi,” said Larry.
“That time we been killem three feller walk-
about-boy longa Sandy Creek.”
“That’s so. Who is playing you?”
“That one Paddy You been there,
Marmi.”
“That’s Larry,” said Rossiter to Judson.
* “They’ve got his way of mounting a horse,
all right. But I don’t see myself.”
“That one, Marmi —put ’em big feller
belly all about.”
Rossiter looked at the exaggeration of his
own corporation; and, libellous as it was in
the hands of the very low comedian of the
tribe, he had to laugh.
The show was so full of histrionic detail
that even Judson followed it, and Larry, as
a translator, found his occupation gone.
Then suddenly the small corroboree ended, and
the actors fled to the dukka dukka, laughing
loudly to disarm the criticism they were
afraid of.
“Now,” said Larry—“altogether big feller
come.”
While they waited he told them of the new
corroboree. A great genius had composed it
among the Workia people. It had travelled

Backache Days and Backache Nights
Do you realise that Pains in the Back, Limbs or Joints, Weak Heart, Irritability,
Languor, Sleeplessness, Urinary Troubles are Symptoms of Kidney Weakness?
*

l
“Every
Picture
Tells a
Story ”
Kidney disease comes on quietly and may take you unawares, for often
its symptoms are put down to other causes —a serious mistake in many cases.
Early symptoms are pain in the back and groin, bladder irritation, stiff or
aching limbs, scarcity or excess of urine, sediment, night sweats —chilly, moist
or swollen extremities drowsiness, blurred sight, dizziness and morbid depression.
For when diseased the kidneys fail to purify the blood, so that uric acid
and waste matter collect in the system, causing rheumatism, stone, dropsy,
gravel, sciatica, lumbago and other complications.
Doan’s Backache Kidney Pills are a tonic for the kidneys, which they
heal and strengthen, enabling these all-important organs to rid the system of
poisonous deposits that are setting up disease throughout the body.
Keep the kidneys well and will keep you well, but you must get
the right medicine.

down in plenty years to Lake Nash; the
Yaroinga brought it to Carrandotta ; thence
it had travelled east, west and south.
“Such a success three road companies
went out with it,” said Judson irreverently.
Whereat Larry paused, asked severely:
“What name that one?” and told further of
the travels on the road. It had travelled to
the Toko ranges, to Boulia and the Diaman-
tina, and from Boulia had been imported by
the Kalkadoons.
The noise of boomerang and hand-slapping
on thighs resumed ; the full strength of the
company came to the stage; rhythmically
the forest of feet stamped the stage to dust
that made a knee-high haze between the
actors and the fires. They introduced figures
of beating the ground with the hands and
doubled the volume of the dust; the leaders,
the “fathers” or “old men” of the dance,
were tireless; the audience only sang the
music of the opera, chanting the play in
statements often meaningless, the actual
story being told with pantomime of the
'dancers.
“ ‘Mol-10-io-du-a-n-por-a-ke-nung-kei!’ That
one mean ‘Mountain longside of the people
sit down,’ ” translated Larry.
They danced tirelessly, finding their detail
as thoroughly as if the least leaf or move-
ment left out of the dance would spoil the
show. Two men with short poles held them
in the ground while the others leaped high
between the poles as if clearing a barrier.
“What’s that, Larry—a fence?”
“White feller puttem pole longa ground—
one feller wire top.”
“A telegraph line, yes. And two black-
fellers are running away. One of the tele-
graph-line men fires again at him. Now,
what’s that, Larry?”
“Two feller white men come,”
“And the telegraph men go away with the
telegraph line. What are they doing with
their hands, Larry? Two horses walking
slow?”
“Two horses; white men no been ridem—
two horse bringem one feller dray.”
“And there’s a dog behind the dray,
Watty,” said Wills. “A man can read it
like a book once he’s learned their sign
language.”
“The white men camp at a sandy creek —
listen to the swishing of those anklets of
singed leaves, just like the sound of a man’s
boots walking in coarse sand.”
A dozen painted men withdrew from the
scene and danced to the dukka dukka.
“They don’t take the horses out of the
dray-—and where are those fellows gone?”
“D’ye notice they never turn their backs
on the audience, Watty?”
“Yes, but where have they gone?”
“Come back quick feller,” said Larry,
“givem horse little feller chaff.”
“Feed-bags?' Yes, a bad drought it was
then. . . .The white men are boiling the billy,
....They’re having lunch.”
Suddenly the mass of the dancers separ-
ated. A spear came from the dukka dukka
and stood upright in the dusty stage. The
quivering of the drums and the boomerangs
and the noise of flesh beating flesh and opos-
sum drums increased in sound. From the
dukka dukka raced the slayers shrieking and
armed with spears. Two of the actors fell
and grovelled as if under the spear,
“They’ve killed the white men... .The dog
is attacking the murderers—look, Watty!”
“They’ve killed the dog.... Three of them
are leading the horses into the creek bed.”
“Now, they’re looking at the dray....” „
“Killem horse now altogether, Marmi....”
The pantomime went on, tremendously per-
feet, naturally translatory. The perfect real-
ism of it gripped the white men—filled them
with mingled horror, rage and admiration,
“The black cows!” said Wills, his right
hand near his belt.
“Not these, old man,” said Rossiter sooth-
ingly. “They’ve got it after it has been
played in a hundred or two of open-air
theatres ; but the author of it was a marvel
even if he was one of the actors in the real
tragedy. Look! What are they doing now?
What is it, Larry?”
“Plenty feller stealem stores Tonga dray;
new feller killem two feller horse. Now
that one boss been puttem horses, dog, feller
white man all alonga dray, make a light,
burn ’em up that one, my word !”
“They’ve made the fire in the creek bed,
Watty.”
It was a great fire, and a long while burn-
ing ; they stood afar off it to show its heat,
and danced around it to show the height of
its flames ; and left out of it not one crack-
ling stick, not one tongue of fire, their
stamping dying down with the ashes, the
long, wailing croon diminishing to the light
sounds of wind among the trees,
Then the “boss” and another leader of the
dance cast away in pantomime the ashes in
the dust, tramping carbonised bone and wood
and the burned fragments of what once were
men and a dog and horses and a dray into
deep drift, and over all turning a cover of
sand with their feet. But before that figure
was complete they withdrew from the ashes
two great circles, indestructible by fire, and
elaborated the pantomime of being burned
by them, wringing their hands in pain,
throwing water upon the circles, dancinsr in
rage, while the wails of the orchestra became
screams of agony, so that the beating of the
time was but an undertone instead of the
theme as it had been in the earlier scenes of
that transcript of life and death. The men
who had been burned were replaced in their
positions by others for a minute until the
front row could return as if healed of their
burnings; then the corroboree danced itself
through the pantomime of recovering the
ironwork of the dray from the fire, and fol-
lowed the men bearing the looted stores
across the imaginary creek. Lastly, the two
leaders bowled those imaginary circles like
great hoops up the stage, the others burned
their feet again dispersing the ashes and
mixing and covering them with sand.
“It’s complete,” said Judson—“your story
of the men who disappeared, Watty.” “But
this comes from the Yaroinga,” said Wills.
“And those two men disappeared in Kalka-
doon country.”
“It’s absolutely it, but it’s built up by
some Yaroinga poet on hearsay.”
“No hearsay about this,” replied Rossi-
ter. “It’s a Kalkadoon story that’s gone
a long way from home and come again to
the Ivalkadoons. And it actually happened
—the yarn’s complete. Where?”
“Wait a minute, what’s that?” interrupted
Wills. “A bit of the rain corroboree”
“They’re bringing the rain. And what
for? Why, to flood the creek and wipe out
the ashes of the fire.”
The figures of the rain danced to send the
sandy creek running a banker; the flood
roared among the white gums and the tragedy
was blotted out.
“Fine!” said Wills. “What were you
saying when I interrupted, Watty?”
“Only that we were looking at the thing
as it happened—as it actually happened.”
“No fear! Just imagination and say-so.”
“What’s imagination? It isn’t invention;
it’s the faculty of making images, and the
finer the faculty the truer the reconstruction.
It happened just like that. What d’ye think
were the big hoops they showed with the
arms rounded and the finger tips together?
Why, man, the tyres of the dray—they rolled
them across the creek and the tracks stayed
in the mud and were lost in the stony coun-
try.”
“But why?”
“That we’ll see —one of these days.”
* * * *
For a year after that, in all his journey-
ings and inspection of stations in the coun-
try of the Undekerefina and the Pitta Pittas,
the Kalkadoons, the Workias, the Mitta-
koodi or the Yaroingas, Walter Bossiter
inquired for the author of the great corro-
boree to find that the inventor was appar-
ently either a Workia. or a Yaroinga—
peoples far removed from the scene of the
tragedy. The Yaroinga did not know where
they had it first; all the tribes he met stated
they had bought the rights of the show and,
quite naturally, inquired no more of its
origin than a white theatrical manager asks
of the religious and moral character of the
author of a foreign play or the customer
asks the storekeeper the age, sex and condi-
tion of the packer of tinned fish.
In time the natives began to hear of his
questions in advance by bush telegraph ; and
then, while secretly contemptuous of such
idle curiosity—a curiosity as to native arts
and customs being mean and undignified in
a white man —they being gentlemen anxious
to please, puzzled his researches the more
by inventing for him the answers which they
thought he desired. The sum total of which
was that nobody knew of two white men who
had disappeared with a horse, a dog and a
dray; that, in point of fact, no such things
had ever existed, and therefore the men could
not have been murdered; finally, that the
corroboree came to the forehead of a medi-
cine man while he slept.
Walter Bossiter apparently accepted their
explanation of the tragedy being a doctor’s
dream; but he did not believe it, though he
abandoned his questioning. A few weeks
after that abandonment he was floodbound
at an out-station between the Selwyn Bange
and the eastern boundary of the Upper
Georgina country. The manager had a fine
collection of aboriginal stone knives and
axes; and Bossiter in looking at these saw
some curved steel weapons, two feet long and
four inches wide, tapering from the back
almost to a razor edge. They were fastened
to hardwood handles by
bloodwood gum over layer on layer «
they were heavy yet keen; teffi

I would take your little throat in my hands,
Slight to snap as a flower stem;
But I could not kill the light in your eyes,
It would still be found in the morning skies,
A valley or a turquoise gem!
I could hush your voice with my fingers’
press,
Leave you a broken, silent thing;
But the lilt of a bird in the green scrub
heart,
The sough of the wind, and your tones would
start
And your words in the soft rain sing.
I could tear you out of my soul today,
Learn to hate and to curse you. too,
Give my heart to the surgeon’s knife.
But what were the use of a shattered life
Bleeding to death for need of you?
